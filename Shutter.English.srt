1
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,958
Cheers!

2
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,333
Excellent.

3
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,541
Let's drink until we drop.

4
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,500
-You should save your energy for tonight.
-Mix it.

5
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,250
Are you kidding me, Tun?
Don't you know who I am?

6
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,250
Alcohol energizes me.

7
00:03:43,708 --> 00:03:46,208
The later it gets, the hornier I become.

8
00:03:46,625 --> 00:03:47,583
-Horny?
-Come, come.

9
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,541
-Let's toast.
-Here's another glass. Have a little sip.

10
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:55,458
So, tell me, Jane.

11
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,250
What year are you in?

12
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:58,833
I'm in my fourth year.

13
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,958
You're old enough to do what you want now.

14
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,958
So, how did you meet Tun?

15
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,541
Because he's a hunk.

16
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,625
You keep saying that since college.

17
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,791
Jim had to ask for her number for you,

18
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:15,958
-you pain in the ass.
-Speaking of college, do you remember

19
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,583
when you got your heart broken?

20
00:04:17,666 --> 00:04:20,916
-He was so drunk.
-Which girl left him a drunken mess?

21
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,458
-Her name was Kay. I do remember that.
-It's "Teochew" Kay.

22
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,208
-Ignore them.
-Right. What do you mean by "ignore them"?

23
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,375
-Wait. I have a question.
-What?

24
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,000
How can a guy like you get married?

25
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,958
Why can't a guy like me get married?

26
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,375
After a long tiring day at work,

27
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,375
all I want is to head home

28
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,208
to cuddle with my wife or my dog,

29
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,958
not waste my life,

30
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:48,208
-partying with you losers, okay?
-I have nothing to do with this, man.

31
00:04:48,291 --> 00:04:49,625
A good man...

32
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,583
went whoring with me last night.

33
00:04:54,541 --> 00:04:55,750
Fooling around so soon?

34
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,458
Here she comes.

35
00:05:01,208 --> 00:05:02,166
Quiet.

36
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,791
What's so funny?

37
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:06,416
Nothing, dear.

38
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,958
I have one last thing to say to you.

39
00:05:09,666 --> 00:05:11,416
One more glass!

40
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:33,083
What are we listening to?

41
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:36,958
Hey. Don't turn it off.

42
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:38,250
It's beautiful.

43
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,625
You guys seem tight.

44
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,875
How long has it been
since you last saw each other?

45
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:49,750
What are you looking at?

46
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:51,916
Someone beautiful.

47
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,041
That's so sappy.

48
00:06:39,916 --> 00:06:40,916
Are you okay?

49
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:43,958
Tun.

50
00:06:45,291 --> 00:06:46,458
Is she dead?

51
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,666
Jane, wait!

52
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:07,875
Just drive away.

53
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:10,375
I said drive away!

54
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,125
Drive away!

55
00:07:24,125 --> 00:07:25,750
Get closer, please.

56
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,500
Okay.

57
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,916
Big smile, Nuch.

58
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,291
Or you won't look pretty.

59
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,750
All Science graduates,

60
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,875
please gather on the stand
for a class photo.

61
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,833
They're calling you.

62
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,041
Where's Jane?

63
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:53,083
She's probably taking photos
with her friends.

64
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:56,708
I thought you guys broke up.

65
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,083
Come on. Let's go.

66
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:58,791
I called you so many times today
but you didn't pick up.

67
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,625
Was your phone on silent?

68
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:01,583
No, it wasn't.

69
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,666
Nuch asked about you today.

70
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,041
When will you be free?

71
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,958
She said she wants to...

72
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:42,166
Jane.

73
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,250
How can you act like this?

74
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,041
You're pretending like nothing happened.

75
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,708
Since that night,

76
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,166
I haven't been able to sleep at all.

77
00:09:59,916 --> 00:10:01,500
Well...

78
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:03,500
You think it doesn't bother me?

79
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,958
We should have gone out
and checked how she was.

80
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,916
It was an accident, Jane.

81
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,083
That's easy for you to say.

82
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,791
You were not the one behind the wheel.

83
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,875
-Hi, Ti.
-Hey.

84
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:34,958
How's business?
Have you got a lot of customers?

85
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,500
With you here this early,

86
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,041
I don't think
many customers will be coming.

87
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:43,416
Are my prints ready?

88
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,500
Yes. Just a second.

89
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,541
Here.

90
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:18,291
Is your processor broken?

91
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:20,833
Let me see.

92
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,250
You punk.

93
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,125
If the prints turn out nice,
you get the credit.

94
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,625
If they suck, it's my fault.

95
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,666
Just look at the negatives.

96
00:11:34,583 --> 00:11:36,041
This is impossible.

97
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,791
I took them. I should know.

98
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:38,875
We'll see.

99
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,250
See?

100
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,541
It's your fault your negatives are ruined.

101
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,583
Tun.

102
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,583
Tun.

103
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:41,541
Tun.

104
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,041
Can you hear me?

105
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,208
Help!

106
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,083
Help!

107
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,583
Don't be scared. I'm here now.

108
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,041
What's wrong with your camera?

109
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,333
I don't know.

110
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,166
The whole roll is ruined.

111
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,583
That many?

112
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,125
What are these shadows?

113
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,041
My camera must be broken.

114
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,166
I don't know how I'm going to tell Nuch.

115
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,125
Tun.

116
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:28,500
Look at this picture.

117
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,166
That woman...

118
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,958
Do you think she's dead?

119
00:16:44,666 --> 00:16:46,000
That's enough, Jane.

120
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,166
I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.

121
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,625
Tun.

122
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,833
Look at this picture.

123
00:18:25,958 --> 00:18:27,625
Are you sure it was here?

124
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,166
Excuse me.

125
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:37,416
What happened?

126
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,458
A few days ago,
a car ran into the billboard.

127
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:42,958
The driver must have been drunk.

128
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,041
Was anyone hurt?

129
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,250
No.

130
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:51,250
Just the broken sign.

131
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:52,708
Are you sure?

132
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,291
What?

133
00:18:54,458 --> 00:18:55,625
Well...

134
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:57,250
Nothing, bro.

135
00:18:58,708 --> 00:18:59,791
Thank you.

136
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:02,875
What?

137
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,875
Are you sure you checked everywhere?

138
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:12,291
It's nothing.

139
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,791
Thanks, anyway.

140
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:22,041
My friend called every police station
and hospital around the area.

141
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:27,166
He said there was no report
of any accidents that night.

142
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,375
How is that possible?

143
00:19:30,458 --> 00:19:32,291
What about the girl we ran over?

144
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:36,375
Are you sure he called everywhere?

145
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,625
Maybe someone helped her.

146
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,000
Maybe she's fine.

147
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:42,791
How can she be fine?

148
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,875
We plowed into her like that.

149
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,791
And even if she's fine...

150
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,000
then what's in those photos?

151
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:56,250
I told you they're not related to her.

152
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:58,208
They're just bad exposures.

153
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,333
Don't you get it?

154
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,458
Tun.

155
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,000
I think you need to make merit, man.

156
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,500
These pictures...

157
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,583
show that there's a spirit haunting you.

158
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,583
How long have you been
a photographer, you punk?

159
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,458
Why are you showing me these?

160
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,791
I know, but...

161
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:27,833
Don't you find these shadows strange?

162
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,666
You want to see spirits?

163
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,750
I'll show you something.

164
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:42,875
Here.

165
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:44,791
This is Auntie Cham's spirit.

166
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,208
Do you know where she is now?

167
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,125
She's still selling fried bananas
in the next alley.

168
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:56,500
Here's Auntie Cham. And here.

169
00:21:57,166 --> 00:21:58,208
Those are all Auntie Cham.

170
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:00,083
They were all taken on the same day.

171
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,166
They're just double exposures,

172
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,458
and out of focus.

173
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:07,541
Come on. I know that.

174
00:22:15,791 --> 00:22:18,250
Everyone is probably familiar
with this place.

175
00:22:19,625 --> 00:22:22,125
It's just an ordinary location...

176
00:22:23,458 --> 00:22:24,750
that we pass by...

177
00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:27,333
and see every day.

178
00:22:33,166 --> 00:22:35,000
Now look at these pictures.

179
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:42,125
These are pictures of the same location.

180
00:22:42,916 --> 00:22:44,041
But do you see...

181
00:22:45,416 --> 00:22:47,125
that everything looks better?

182
00:22:49,416 --> 00:22:52,458
That means photography

183
00:22:52,875 --> 00:22:55,208
does not always convey reality.

184
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,416
It depends on how...

185
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,125
the image is framed,

186
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:05,333
what the photographer chooses to reveal,

187
00:23:05,708 --> 00:23:07,166
and what to conceal.

188
00:23:08,708 --> 00:23:11,166
Your perspective is critical.

189
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:27,583
SPECIAL SCOOP: SPIRIT PICTURES

190
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,250
Hey, Jane. You're early.

191
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:45,083
I'll get it.

192
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,291
-Hello?
-Hello, Tun.

193
00:23:52,375 --> 00:23:54,666
It's me, Jane.
I'll come by in the afternoon.

194
00:23:55,916 --> 00:23:56,833
Hello?

195
00:23:56,958 --> 00:23:59,166
Tun, can you hear me?

196
00:23:59,791 --> 00:24:00,750
Hello?

197
00:24:00,916 --> 00:24:01,875
Tun!

198
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,375
Tun!

199
00:24:03,666 --> 00:24:04,708
Hello?

200
00:24:05,875 --> 00:24:06,833
Hello?

201
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,083
What's wrong?

202
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:38,958
I don't know.

203
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,500
My neck has been hurting
since the accident.

204
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,208
You should go see a doctor.

205
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:47,416
I'm sure it's nothing serious.

206
00:24:51,041 --> 00:24:52,750
What's the use of talking to these quacks?

207
00:24:54,208 --> 00:24:57,500
REAL GHOSTS, DEADLY SPIRIT,
GHOST STORIES, GHOST PATH 

208
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:01,041
Are you a reporter?

209
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,250
No.

210
00:25:03,708 --> 00:25:06,125
The funeral foundation told us
to come here.

211
00:25:08,625 --> 00:25:10,750
We run a legal operation here.

212
00:25:11,333 --> 00:25:12,791
We have all the permits.

213
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,583
Excuse me.

214
00:26:03,958 --> 00:26:06,583
Are all these pictures fake?

215
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:10,416
Piak. Go tell our boss he has guests.

216
00:26:13,583 --> 00:26:14,750
Everyone fakes them.

217
00:26:16,458 --> 00:26:17,291
You know,

218
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:19,666
those photos are always a hit.

219
00:26:21,083 --> 00:26:22,833
Any issues with them sell out.

220
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:25,041
Do you think...

221
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,541
we can always find real ones?

222
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:31,833
Isn't that deceiving the public?

223
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:35,250
Our readers...

224
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:37,791
want to see scary photos.

225
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:41,125
They don't want love stories.

226
00:26:42,875 --> 00:26:46,416
Does that mean
all the published photos are fake?

227
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,083
I didn't say that.

228
00:27:05,583 --> 00:27:06,458
Take a look.

229
00:27:07,666 --> 00:27:08,666
Do you see anything?

230
00:27:09,875 --> 00:27:12,166
This is the first photo I had.

231
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,875
I took it at home.

232
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,166
People say the shadow in the back

233
00:27:18,375 --> 00:27:20,666
bears an uncanny resemblance to my mom.

234
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,208
Believe what you will.

235
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:29,583
But this picture...

236
00:27:30,625 --> 00:27:33,000
was taken years after my mom passed away.

237
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,583
You know,

238
00:27:37,166 --> 00:27:38,125
sometimes

239
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,875
spirits just want to be close
to their loved ones.

240
00:27:47,541 --> 00:27:48,958
The pictures that you see,

241
00:27:49,875 --> 00:27:51,083
for me,

242
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:53,791
are more than just...

243
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,583
pictures with strange shadows in them.

244
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,875
It's the stories behind the pictures.

245
00:28:06,041 --> 00:28:07,208
Think about it.

246
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,125
Why would the dead...

247
00:28:11,208 --> 00:28:12,583
return to the living...

248
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,083
if they are not trying
to tell us something?

249
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,833
Most importantly,

250
00:28:26,166 --> 00:28:27,416
people also believe

251
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,875
that there are connections...

252
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:33,458
between the shadows
and someone in the picture.

253
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,958
A father.

254
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:40,541
A mother.

255
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:42,375
A lover.

256
00:28:44,666 --> 00:28:45,791
Or it could be someone

257
00:28:45,875 --> 00:28:47,958
whom you've wronged in the past.

258
00:29:12,291 --> 00:29:15,000
How can we be sure
those photos aren't just bad exposures

259
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:16,333
or were forged?

260
00:29:17,166 --> 00:29:19,708
What do you think about polaroids?

261
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,791
Can you forge them?

262
00:29:25,958 --> 00:29:28,083
You load the film cartridge in,
press the shutter.

263
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:30,125
And out comes the photo.

264
00:29:48,666 --> 00:29:50,041
Tell me, then.

265
00:29:51,291 --> 00:29:52,791
How can they be faked?

266
00:29:57,416 --> 00:29:59,875
How do we know what they want?

267
00:30:00,833 --> 00:30:03,666
Perhaps the answer is in the photo.

268
00:30:14,708 --> 00:30:16,583
Here's the last two shots.

269
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,875
Big smiles.

270
00:30:22,458 --> 00:30:25,541
Can you change your pose for me?

271
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:29,166
Embrace her, hold the bouquet

272
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:31,416
and put your cheeks close together.

273
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:33,958
Good.

274
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:35,166
Beautiful.

275
00:30:37,041 --> 00:30:38,916
We're done. Thank you.

276
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,791
Thank you to you both.

277
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:44,500
Take them to the dressing room.

278
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,208
What the hell?

279
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,416
Who's doing that?

280
00:31:16,166 --> 00:31:17,583
Aum, check the fuse!

281
00:31:19,666 --> 00:31:20,666
Hey, Aum!

282
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,583
Who's doing that?

283
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:31,083
Is it you, Aum?

284
00:31:37,583 --> 00:31:38,416
Who is it?

285
00:31:41,625 --> 00:31:43,041
Who's there?

286
00:31:45,208 --> 00:31:46,458
I said, who's there?

287
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,791
Where are you, Aum?

288
00:32:04,291 --> 00:32:05,166
Who's there?

289
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:58,500
Please step off the scale.

290
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,250
Step on it again.

291
00:33:12,458 --> 00:33:13,833
Have you been working hard lately?

292
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:15,833
Well, not really.

293
00:33:16,541 --> 00:33:17,916
How long has it been hurting?

294
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:20,666
For quite awhile.

295
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:23,083
But it's gotten worse lately.

296
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,875
I had a car accident.

297
00:33:26,333 --> 00:33:27,583
A car accident?

298
00:33:28,458 --> 00:33:30,583
I've done the examination
and everything seems fine.

299
00:33:31,583 --> 00:33:33,041
You shouldn't worry.

300
00:33:33,791 --> 00:33:36,666
But it really hurts, doctor.

301
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,958
Your x-rays came back normal.

302
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:41,875
It might be a muscle strain.

303
00:33:42,458 --> 00:33:44,791
Try taking the medicine I prescribed.

304
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,916
Mr. Tun, your prescription's ready.

305
00:33:52,166 --> 00:33:56,375
Take this medicine
three times a day after meals

306
00:33:56,666 --> 00:33:58,791
until the prescription runs out.

307
00:34:00,958 --> 00:34:02,250
Lying bastard.

308
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,666
Pardon?

309
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,583
Yes?

310
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,458
Nothing.

311
00:34:13,458 --> 00:34:15,166
Lying bastard.

312
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:18,375
Lying bastard.

313
00:34:19,541 --> 00:34:21,958
As for this medicine, the doctor said...

314
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:23,708
Sir!

315
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:25,791
What's wrong?

316
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:30,750
...is rarely seen.

317
00:34:31,125 --> 00:34:33,833
When grasshoppers begin mating,

318
00:34:34,041 --> 00:34:37,416
the male can smell the female

319
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:41,958
from a distance up to 100 meters.

320
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:46,416
Then, the male will carefully approach
the female

321
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:50,875
and hook itself onto her belly.

322
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:53,208
And they will then begin to mate.

323
00:34:54,708 --> 00:34:58,458
The female's response
to this is surprising.

324
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:03,333
The male will become her prey.

325
00:35:03,916 --> 00:35:07,625
She will slowly eat his head off

326
00:35:08,666 --> 00:35:10,916
while they are mating.

327
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:16,750
Eventually, the male succumbs to death.

328
00:35:25,583 --> 00:35:29,708
-Excuse me, where is room 301?
-It's upstairs.

329
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:36,500
Jane.

330
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:41,916
Jane.

331
00:35:52,208 --> 00:35:53,083
Jane.

332
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:06,375
Who's there?

333
00:37:36,541 --> 00:37:37,416
Ton.

334
00:37:38,625 --> 00:37:39,750
What's wrong?

335
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,000
Tun, I'm about to die.

336
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:48,166
What's going on?

337
00:37:49,208 --> 00:37:50,166
The photos...

338
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:53,166
Bring me those photos.

339
00:37:54,166 --> 00:37:55,375
What photos?

340
00:37:55,583 --> 00:37:56,541
Are you drunk?

341
00:37:58,583 --> 00:37:59,791
Those photos...

342
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,500
Where did you hide them?

343
00:38:02,125 --> 00:38:03,208
Give them to me.

344
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:06,708
Do you remember that bitch?

345
00:38:07,166 --> 00:38:08,291
Calm down, man.

346
00:38:09,541 --> 00:38:10,541
What photos?

347
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:12,166
Just give them to me!

348
00:38:12,416 --> 00:38:14,583
Calm down, man!

349
00:38:15,625 --> 00:38:17,041
Ton, calm down.

350
00:38:17,541 --> 00:38:19,166
What photos?

351
00:38:24,583 --> 00:38:25,458
Ton.

352
00:38:25,875 --> 00:38:27,375
I'll call your wife.

353
00:39:12,166 --> 00:39:13,208
What are you doing?

354
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,708
I'm just tidying up the place.

355
00:39:23,125 --> 00:39:24,250
Is your neck still sore?

356
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:27,791
Yes.

357
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:30,166
Take it easy. Don't work too hard.

359
00:44:26,375 --> 00:44:27,291
Ton.

360
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:29,916
It's me, Tun.

361
00:44:31,875 --> 00:44:32,916
Are you home?

362
00:44:48,083 --> 00:44:49,125
Ton.

363
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:52,750
Are you home?

364
00:45:02,291 --> 00:45:03,500
Ton.

365

366
00:46:19,625 --> 00:46:20,500
Ton!

367
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:22,875
Ton!

368
00:46:24,958 --> 00:46:25,916
Ton!

369
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:34,875
Ton!

370
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:14,541
I'm really sorry.

371
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,083
You know, right?

372
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:18,833
You know what was bothering him.

373
00:47:23,291 --> 00:47:25,000
I don't know. Suddenly he...

374
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,166
It's all because of you guys, right?

375
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,500
Have you all gone insane?

376
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,666
What do you mean?

377
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:37,833
Why did everyone commit suicide?

378
00:47:39,291 --> 00:47:40,291
Who?

379
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,166
Didn't you know?

380
00:47:44,041 --> 00:47:45,500
The other two

381
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:47,875
just jumped off the building
and killed themselves.

382
00:47:48,833 --> 00:47:49,958
Which two?

383
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:57,291
The ones who sat next to you
at the wedding.

384
00:48:43,666 --> 00:48:45,041
Who is this woman?

385
00:48:49,708 --> 00:48:51,000
Where did you get that?

386
00:48:52,375 --> 00:48:54,583
She's the shadow in the photos, right?

387
00:48:56,291 --> 00:48:57,625
Who is she?

388
00:49:00,666 --> 00:49:02,375
How is she related to you?

389
00:49:21,916 --> 00:49:23,500
I knew her in college.

390
00:49:27,125 --> 00:49:28,333
Her name is Net.

391
00:49:32,291 --> 00:49:34,208
She was a quiet person.

392
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:37,333
She didn't have any friends.

393
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:43,958
Everyone saw her as a freak.

394
00:49:49,125 --> 00:49:50,750
I felt sorry for her.

395
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,583
We dated but I kept it a secret.

396
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,916
She loved me a lot.

397
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,291
She threatened to kill herself.

398
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:09,416
I didn't know what to do.

399
00:53:09,916 --> 00:53:11,833
All my friends saw it as a joke.

400
00:53:12,166 --> 00:53:14,083
How were they involved?

401
00:53:14,458 --> 00:53:15,958
Why are they dead?

402
00:53:16,541 --> 00:53:17,375
They...

403
00:53:17,791 --> 00:53:19,083
What did they do?

404
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:22,750
I don't know.

405
00:53:24,666 --> 00:53:26,916
Ton said he would take care of it.

406
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,666
After that, Net disappeared.

407
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:36,666
I never saw her again.

408
00:53:37,708 --> 00:53:39,833
Didn't you try to stop them?

409
00:53:42,041 --> 00:53:44,208
How could you let it happen?

410
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,500
What could I do?

411
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:57,583
Now everyone is dead.

412
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:02,625
I am...

413
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:05,375
I'm probably next.

414
00:54:45,291 --> 00:54:46,541
It's funny.

415
00:54:49,125 --> 00:54:51,250
We always say...

416
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:54,041
if we could turn back time,

417
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,708
we...

418
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:59,291
we wouldn't repeat our mistakes again.

419
00:55:02,541 --> 00:55:04,291
Do you think she's okay?

420
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:07,375
Will we see her tomorrow?

421
00:55:07,791 --> 00:55:08,833
Go to sleep.

422
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:13,333
I'll keep you company tonight.

423
00:57:23,041 --> 00:57:23,958
Excuse me.

424
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:27,083
Do you have any toilet paper?

425
00:58:03,625 --> 00:58:05,166
Would you mind letting me shit first?

426
00:58:05,250 --> 00:58:06,250
I'm sorry.

427
00:59:18,625 --> 00:59:20,125
What's going on, Tun?

428
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:36,416
Tun, what's wrong?

429
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,750
What is it?

430
01:00:43,666 --> 01:00:45,166
Is it around here?

431
01:00:56,916 --> 01:00:57,875
Excuse me.

432
01:00:58,375 --> 01:00:59,666
Do you know where this house is?

433
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:06,000
Mom, do you know this house?

434
01:01:41,625 --> 01:01:42,708
Ma'am.

435
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:57,458
Excuse me.

436
01:01:57,541 --> 01:01:59,083
Is this Net's house?

437
01:02:01,083 --> 01:02:02,333
What do you want?

438
01:02:03,583 --> 01:02:04,583
Well...

439
01:02:05,041 --> 01:02:07,250
We're her friends.

440
01:02:08,541 --> 01:02:10,625
Net's friends? Come inside.

441
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:24,500
Have some water. You must be tired.

442
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,541
Did you drive here from Bangkok?

443
01:02:27,958 --> 01:02:29,125
Yes.

444
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:33,208
Well...

445
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:36,041
We'd like to ask you about Net.

446
01:02:37,625 --> 01:02:39,083
She's not feeling well.

447
01:02:39,166 --> 01:02:40,916
She's taking a nap after taking her pills.

448
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,250
Should I wake her?

449
01:02:48,541 --> 01:02:50,041
Stay for dinner.

450
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:52,375
I was about to cook.

451
01:02:52,541 --> 01:02:55,208
I'm making Kang Som, Net's favorite dish.

452
01:02:56,875 --> 01:02:58,333
Net will be so happy.

453
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:00,833
Her friends don't visit often.

454
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:02,875
Wait right here.

455
01:03:22,666 --> 01:03:23,958
What are you doing, Tun?

456
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:42,958
What are you doing?

457
01:04:49,250 --> 01:04:51,250
Did she commit suicide?

458
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,750
We should hold a funeral for her.

459
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,041
No.

460
01:05:02,125 --> 01:05:03,708
I won't cremate my own daughter.

461
01:05:06,041 --> 01:05:07,250
Ma'am.

462
01:05:08,625 --> 01:05:11,708
I don't know if you believe such things,

463
01:05:12,083 --> 01:05:15,541
but I'd like you to look at these photos.

464
01:05:16,500 --> 01:05:20,041
They were taken around campus.

465
01:05:22,333 --> 01:05:25,041
Some of the places...

466
01:05:25,708 --> 01:05:28,500
were rooms Net had been in.

467
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:30,625
And...

468
01:05:31,125 --> 01:05:33,833
And those shadows appeared.

469
01:05:37,125 --> 01:05:38,375
I think that...

470
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:43,166
Net's spirit is restless.

471
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,041
Net.

472
01:05:49,750 --> 01:05:51,166
My dear Net.

473
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,500
Why don't you come visit me?

474
01:06:04,666 --> 01:06:06,958
You know what happened to her, right?

475
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:09,666
And what happened in Bangkok.

476
01:06:18,583 --> 01:06:19,666
Ma'am...

477
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:23,208
Ma'am.

478
01:06:24,791 --> 01:06:26,625
The reason Net's spirit is still here

479
01:06:27,000 --> 01:06:30,416
might be because
her spirit is not at peace.

480
01:06:35,125 --> 01:06:37,291
We should hold a funeral for her.

481
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:40,083
Please.

482
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:56,541
Ever since Net came home,

483
01:06:56,625 --> 01:06:58,250
she seemed different.

484
01:06:58,416 --> 01:07:00,333
She wouldn't talk to anyone.

485
01:07:00,583 --> 01:07:03,125
No one knew what happened in Bangkok.

486
01:07:05,041 --> 01:07:07,333
One day, she overdosed on pills.

487
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:10,583
Luckily, her mother found her

488
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:13,041
and got her to the hospital in time.

489
01:07:13,375 --> 01:07:15,875
After she fully recovered,

490
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:20,125
she climbed on the hospital roof

491
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,458
and jumped off the edge.

492
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:27,291
Why did Net's mom still kept
her body around?

493
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:33,500
She went a little crazy after Net's death.

494
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,500
No matter what anyone said,
she refused to cremate her.

495
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:41,041
The villagers got scared.

496
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:44,541
No one wanted to socialize with her.

497
01:09:52,583 --> 01:09:53,833
Can't sleep?

498
01:09:59,875 --> 01:10:01,666
Tell me the truth, Tun.

499
01:10:03,041 --> 01:10:04,500
Did you love Net?

500
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:10,416
I tried to, Jane.

501
01:10:17,291 --> 01:10:19,500
I believed that one day I would.

502
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:27,583
But I was fooling myself.

503
01:10:35,958 --> 01:10:37,625
When I broke it off,

504
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,291
I was a total asshole to her.

505
01:10:47,541 --> 01:10:49,625
But she still loved me.

506
01:10:56,416 --> 01:10:58,208
I just want this to be over.

507
01:11:00,458 --> 01:11:02,791
If she wants me to die, I will.

508
01:11:04,083 --> 01:11:05,625
Don't say that.

509
01:11:06,791 --> 01:11:08,458
It's almost over.

510
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:11,125
No, it's not.

511
01:11:16,583 --> 01:11:18,750
I know she'll come for me.

512
01:11:19,791 --> 01:11:20,833
Tun.

513
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:23,625
We've come this far.

514
01:11:26,166 --> 01:11:27,958
And you're sorry for what you did.

515
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,416
I'm sure she knows.

516
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:34,666
Don't talk like that anymore.

517
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:43,500
I'm sorry.

518
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:51,333
Do you still love me?

519
01:11:57,791 --> 01:12:00,291
You won't leave me no matter what, right?

520
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:45,125
Jane.

521
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,208
Jane.

522
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,333
Tun.

523
01:15:24,875 --> 01:15:25,791
Jane.

524
01:15:26,416 --> 01:15:27,916
Where were you?

525
01:15:29,458 --> 01:15:31,083
Why did you leave me alone?

526
01:15:31,916 --> 01:15:33,125
We've got to go, Jane.

527
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:37,875
Asshole!

528
01:15:39,541 --> 01:15:41,166
Why did you leave me?

529
01:15:41,541 --> 01:15:43,208
Don't you love me anymore?

530
01:15:43,416 --> 01:15:45,125
Where are you going?

531
01:15:48,208 --> 01:15:50,375
Where are you going?

532
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:34,916
Tun.

533
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:36,625
How are you feeling?

534
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:41,166
What happened last night?

535
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:43,833
Tun.

536
01:17:45,583 --> 01:17:46,625
Jane.

537
01:17:46,958 --> 01:17:48,166
Jane.

538
01:17:55,625 --> 01:17:58,625
The abbot said Net's body
will be cremated today.

539
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:03,958
It's over.

540
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:06,875
-Hello.
-Hello, Jane.

541
01:20:07,291 --> 01:20:08,708
You're here to pick up the photos?

542
01:20:09,166 --> 01:20:10,041
Where's Tun?

543
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:11,583
He's busy.

544
01:20:12,083 --> 01:20:13,125
Good.

545
01:20:13,541 --> 01:20:16,125
I hope he gets busy often,
so I can see you instead.

546
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:25,791
You guys went on vacation?

547
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:28,291
We went to Hua Hin.

548
01:20:28,375 --> 01:20:29,708
When did you go?

549
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:31,958
Last week.

550
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,791
This photo is...

551
01:20:40,125 --> 01:20:41,125
What's wrong?

552
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:48,875
Are you getting fatter?

553
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:53,166
I almost didn't recognize you.

554
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,666
Hi.

555
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:59,458
-Jumbo prints, please.
-Okay.

556
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,750
Write your name here, please.

557
01:23:48,083 --> 01:23:49,291
Get her!

558
01:24:26,416 --> 01:24:27,500
Jane.

559
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,083
Why are you crying?

560
01:24:32,875 --> 01:24:33,875
Asshole.

561
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,416
How could you be so cruel?

562
01:24:43,916 --> 01:24:46,000
Jane, where did you find these?

563
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:50,458
-Jane.
-If I didn't find them,

564
01:24:50,666 --> 01:24:53,083
I'd be a fool forever, right?

565
01:24:58,875 --> 01:25:00,375
Let me explain, Jane.

566
01:25:03,791 --> 01:25:05,583
What is there to say?

567
01:25:10,125 --> 01:25:11,750
I've always believed you.

568
01:25:19,125 --> 01:25:21,041
It turns out I don't know you at all.

569
01:25:35,625 --> 01:25:36,750
Tun.

570
01:25:38,083 --> 01:25:40,791
Take her pictures, so she doesn't blab.

571
01:25:41,166 --> 01:25:43,083
Tun, help me!

572
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,000
I know it was wrong.

573
01:25:47,833 --> 01:25:49,750
Take her pictures now!

574
01:25:50,875 --> 01:25:51,958
What's wrong?

575
01:25:53,708 --> 01:25:55,166
I'm your buddy!

576
01:25:55,791 --> 01:25:56,916
Hurry!

577
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:07,625
Tun, help me!

578
01:26:21,833 --> 01:26:23,708
I never forgave myself.

579
01:26:23,833 --> 01:26:25,625
But I was young and stupid.

580
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:28,416
Stop talking.

581
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:31,916
I want to go home.

582
01:27:29,375 --> 01:27:30,500
Come out.

583
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:36,666
Where are you?

584
01:27:44,041 --> 01:27:45,583
Didn't you say you love me?

585
01:27:48,208 --> 01:27:49,625
Didn't you love me so much?

586
01:27:57,625 --> 01:27:59,666
Till death do us part, huh?

587
01:28:05,333 --> 01:28:06,750
Jane's gone now!

588
01:29:50,666 --> 01:29:54,625
Sometimes, spirits just want to be close
to their loved ones.
