00:00:21,466 --> 00:00:26,466

2
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:52,933
You're watching from Streamflex
3
00:01:40,838 --> 00:01:42,173
<i>Good morning, Mr. Bryce.</i>

4
00:01:42,381 --> 00:01:44,175
<i>I trust the pickup ran smoothly.</i>

5
00:01:44,509 --> 00:01:47,094
Hand-off was clean.
No stops till the exit point.

6
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:52,475
<i>Clear roads all the way, Chief,</i>

7
00:01:54,143 --> 00:01:55,269
<i>just as you predicted.</i>

8
00:01:55,353 --> 00:01:56,187
Thank you for agreeing

9
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,147
to an earlier departure time,
Mr. Kurosawa.

10
00:01:58,397 --> 00:01:59,708
I'm honored that you and your wives

11
00:01:59,732 --> 00:02:01,776
have entrusted
a Triple-A Protection Service today.

12
00:02:06,864 --> 00:02:09,492
<i>Moving red to green option,
coming in on your vector.</i>

13
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:12,370
<i>Get the engine started,
I want an immediate takeoff.</i>

14
00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,229
<i>Air space has already been cleared.</i>

15
00:02:14,622 --> 00:02:15,622
<i>Roger that.</i>

16
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,167
<i>All channels moving
to restricted air space.</i>

17
00:02:23,339 --> 00:02:24,339
Shall we?

18
00:02:37,937 --> 00:02:38,938
Mr. Kurosawa...

19
00:02:48,865 --> 00:02:50,616
<i>Another
Triple-A delivery, sir.</i>

20
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,980
Stay with him
till he's airborne.

21
00:02:52,034 --> 00:02:53,744
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>
- Canvas is clear?

22
00:02:54,412 --> 00:02:56,622
<i>Nothing for miles, Chief. Almost boring.</i>

23
00:02:56,873 --> 00:02:57,873
And what's our motto?

24
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,167
Boring is always best.

25
00:03:10,803 --> 00:03:11,803
Move! Move!

26
00:03:12,179 --> 00:03:13,973
Client down! Client down!

27
00:03:14,056 --> 00:03:15,099
<i>Code seven! Code seven!</i>

28
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:16,349
<i>Jesus!</i>

29
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:18,394
<i>It's like a goddamn milkshake in here!</i>

30
00:03:18,603 --> 00:03:19,812
<i>Bravo One down.</i>

31
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:21,772
<i>We need
a clean-up team in here now!</i>

32
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:23,774
<i>Repeat, Bravo One down.</i>

33
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:44,003
<i>♪ There's no one to have fun with ♪</i>

34
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:55,306
<i>♪ Since my baby's love
Has been done with ♪</i>

35
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:05,608
<i>♪ All I do is think of you... ♪</i>

36
00:04:17,036 --> 00:04:18,955
Fucking piece of paper I've got here.

37
00:04:19,372 --> 00:04:22,500
...I'm gonna beat this motherfucker's...

38
00:04:26,087 --> 00:04:27,087
Holy shit.

39
00:04:32,593 --> 00:04:33,593
Mr. Seifert.

40
00:04:36,222 --> 00:04:38,432
- Are we ready to go?
- "Are we ready?"

41
00:04:38,683 --> 00:04:39,558
I've been waiting!

42
00:04:39,642 --> 00:04:42,269
What the hell took you so long?
It's half past 9:00!

43
00:04:42,353 --> 00:04:44,689
Apologies. I had to make some
preparations... Mr. Seifert.

44
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:45,772
Mr. Seifert!

45
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,628
It's best if I go through doors first.

46
00:04:49,068 --> 00:04:50,068
- Okay?
- Okay.

47
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:52,631
You don't know what I'm dealing with here.

48
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:53,864
Come on, let's go, let's go.

49
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:54,865
- Double time.
- You don't understand.

50
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:56,617
These people are animals!

51
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,494
They're probably here already,

52
00:04:59,412 --> 00:05:01,556
- just waiting for me to leave.
- I can appreciate your concern,

53
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,374
but I assure you, you are perfectly safe.

54
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:05,591
All you need to do
is exactly what I tell you.

55
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:08,713
Mr. Seifert? Mr. Seifert?
This way, please.

56
00:05:09,088 --> 00:05:11,173
All right. Is it not enough cocaine,
or too much?

57
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,762
They say you're Triple-A rated.

58
00:05:17,179 --> 00:05:18,180
Is that a real thing?

59
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:22,101
Let's just focus on you dying
of natural causes, shall we?

60
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:24,270
Soon.

61
00:05:24,478 --> 00:05:25,478
That's my car.

62
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,897
Take a mental picture of it.

63
00:05:27,356 --> 00:05:28,983
I find it safer if we're using a car

64
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:30,818
that blends in
with the surrounding traffic.

65
00:05:33,237 --> 00:05:35,477
Well, that was easy.
In fact, practically nothing at all.

66
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,991
Boring is always best.

67
00:05:37,241 --> 00:05:38,401
I trust you'll reduce your...

68
00:05:40,077 --> 00:05:41,746
- <i>What?</i>
- This is Michael Bryce.

69
00:05:41,829 --> 00:05:43,140
I'm an executive protection agent,

70
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:44,725
fully licensed and bonded within the EU.

71
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:47,543
<i>Fuckin' hell. I know it's you.
I've got caller ID!</i>

72
00:05:47,626 --> 00:05:50,629
<i>Such a fucking dick.
You got a pickup for me or what?</i>

73
00:05:50,713 --> 00:05:54,550
Yes. I've extracted my client
from 27 Saint George Street.

74
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:55,718
Clean-up is required.

75
00:05:56,886 --> 00:06:00,514
<i>On the seventh floor, north stairwell,
I've left a French national</i>

76
00:06:00,598 --> 00:06:02,141
employed by the Taray Crime Syndicate.

77
00:06:03,392 --> 00:06:05,112
<i>You'll find two more
in the south stairwell.</i>

78
00:06:05,352 --> 00:06:08,232
<i>On the roof, you're gonna find another
who's gonna need some dental work.</i>

79
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:12,818
<i>In the alley, there's two gentlemen
who may require some counseling.</i>

80
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:18,532
<i>One more in the east office
on the sixth floor under construction</i>

81
00:06:19,241 --> 00:06:21,577
<i>and one on the number three elevator.</i>

82
00:06:24,747 --> 00:06:25,831
Oh, oh, oh!

83
00:06:25,915 --> 00:06:28,250
<i>Parking garage,
under the Rolls-Royce in space five,</i>

84
00:06:28,334 --> 00:06:29,960
<i>there's a pound of plastic explosives,</i>

85
00:06:30,044 --> 00:06:31,564
you might want to call the bomb squad.

86
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:35,716
Check that. Make it the fire department.

87
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,634
Is that my car?

88
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:39,178
I'm afraid so. Have a seat,
it's been a long day.

89
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:47,061
That was a custom Rolls-Royce,
one of a kind.

90
00:06:47,394 --> 00:06:48,834
I thought that was an unusual color.

91
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:50,021
Was that periwinkle?

92
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:52,316
I did find this in the backseat.

93
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:53,526
Scraps!

94
00:06:53,609 --> 00:06:54,609
Precious, aren't they?

95
00:06:57,196 --> 00:06:58,447
It smells like ass in here.

96
00:06:58,864 --> 00:06:59,864
Buckle up.

97
00:07:00,032 --> 00:07:02,284
This car certainly
isn't Triple-A rated.

98
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:04,537
It's not even fit for animals.

99
00:07:35,693 --> 00:07:37,695
Keep moving!

100
00:07:38,487 --> 00:07:40,406
Everybody go home!

101
00:07:41,574 --> 00:07:42,700
Get out of the way!

102
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:51,625
Have a look there.

103
00:08:12,938 --> 00:08:14,398
Knock on the doors.

104
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:23,281
How's your English?

105
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:29,496
I don't know much English, Mr. President.

106
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:35,085
"The only way for the country to progress

107
00:08:36,003 --> 00:08:40,299
is by eradicating the scourge of genocide

108
00:08:40,382 --> 00:08:44,261
blackening our country
and our livelihood."

109
00:08:47,306 --> 00:08:49,183
.I appreciate your modesty.

110
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:55,022
I hope we're not...
disturbing your family.

111
00:08:58,859 --> 00:09:00,361
They are on holiday.

112
00:09:00,903 --> 00:09:01,903
Good for them.

113
00:09:04,323 --> 00:09:06,116
Family makes a man whole.

114
00:09:13,332 --> 00:09:15,501
I could have
you executed for treason,

115
00:09:15,584 --> 00:09:20,130
but another would simply stand
a little bit higher on your corpse.

116
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,094
There must be some other lesson
I could teach you.

117
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:34,812
As I said,

118
00:09:36,355 --> 00:09:38,232
there is nothing more important...

119
00:09:38,941 --> 00:09:40,317
than a good education.

120
00:09:46,615 --> 00:09:47,615
<i>Professor Asimov,</i>

121
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:50,703
can you please tell the court
what happened next?

122
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:54,289
Then... I was taken

123
00:09:54,373 --> 00:09:56,792
to one of Dukhovich's internment camps.

124
00:09:59,545 --> 00:10:01,296
I was there for three years

125
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,718
until he was finally overthrown.

126
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,305
Arrested like the monster he is.

127
00:10:12,683 --> 00:10:14,184
Thank you, Professor Asimov.

128
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:18,897
Your Honor, I request
that this entire testimony be disregarded.

129
00:10:19,189 --> 00:10:22,401
Without any evidence,
this is merely hearsay.

130
00:10:23,527 --> 00:10:24,820
Sustained.

131
00:10:24,903 --> 00:10:26,655
<i>The trial
of former Belarusian President</i>

132
00:10:26,739 --> 00:10:28,574
<i>Vladislav Dukhovich continued today</i>

133
00:10:28,657 --> 00:10:31,452
<i>with emotional testimony
from many of his country's victims.</i>

134
00:10:31,827 --> 00:10:34,663
But while powerful to hear,
Dukhovich's attorneys say

135
00:10:34,747 --> 00:10:37,249
they are nothing more
than the lies of his enemies.

136
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,835
Long one of the world's
most brutal dictators...

137
00:10:39,918 --> 00:10:42,504
Who stands accused
of ethnic cleansing on a massive scale.

138
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:45,841
An unprecedented level of security
is in place around the courthouse.

139
00:10:45,924 --> 00:10:48,385
Even the airspace
above this city is closed.

140
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:50,929
So far, the prosecution
has been crippled by the lack

141
00:10:51,013 --> 00:10:52,931
of any hard evidence
against Dukhovich himself.

142
00:10:53,015 --> 00:10:54,516
Numerous witnesses

143
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,643
who were expected
to testify have disappeared.

144
00:10:56,727 --> 00:10:59,772
Is there anyone brave enough
to come forward with evidence

145
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:02,274
and finally put an end
to his brutal reign?

146
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,835
Mr. Kincaid,
this is Interpol's offer.

147
00:11:22,169 --> 00:11:25,130
In return for your testimony
against former President Dukhovich,

148
00:11:25,589 --> 00:11:28,675
your wife will receive a full
pardon from all jurisdictions.

149
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:33,680
You're going to pardon an innocent woman?

150
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,041
That's mighty fucking white of you.

151
00:11:38,018 --> 00:11:39,770
Assuming we accept this arrangement

152
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:41,146
for Sonia Kincaid,

153
00:11:41,855 --> 00:11:44,441
there's still the matter
of an agreement regarding my client.

154
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:50,488
He will receive

155
00:11:51,698 --> 00:11:55,244
this letter recommending leniency.

156
00:11:55,577 --> 00:11:57,412
Mr. Kincaid is a contract killer

157
00:11:57,496 --> 00:11:59,915
facing two dozen counts
of murder in ten countries.

158
00:12:00,165 --> 00:12:01,708
Absent a legitimate deal,

159
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:04,294
he will never breathe free air again.
Under no...

160
00:12:11,802 --> 00:12:13,887
Sonia goes free.

161
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:17,850
We're all set, Director Casoria.

162
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:20,519
Let's get this gentleman to The Hague.

163
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:32,072
Mr. Kincaid,
this is Agent Roussel.

164
00:12:33,157 --> 00:12:34,300
She'll be leading a security detail,

165
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:37,452
which will escort you
to the International Criminal Court.

166
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:42,416
You know, Dukhovich's men have killed
every single witness brought against them,

167
00:12:42,624 --> 00:12:45,419
and my security detail
is a dozen off-duty cops?

168
00:12:46,253 --> 00:12:49,214
These are the most highly-trained officers
in Europe, Mr. Kincaid.

169
00:12:49,298 --> 00:12:50,966
We have taken every precaution

170
00:12:51,049 --> 00:12:53,760
to make sure that your involvement
is completely classified.

171
00:12:54,428 --> 00:12:55,470
It's a secret?

172
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,140
That makes me feel so much better.

173
00:12:58,432 --> 00:12:59,516
Well, I can assure you,

174
00:13:00,184 --> 00:13:01,393
even if there was an attempt,

175
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:03,534
we're more than prepared for any assault.

176
00:13:06,064 --> 00:13:07,983
You prepared for that assault,
motherfucker?

177
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:12,487
Uncuff me, give me some car keys,
a couple guns, I'll meet you guys there.

178
00:13:12,571 --> 00:13:15,449
The court's deadline
is at 5:00 p.m. tomorrow, Mr. Kincaid.

179
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:20,329
That gives us 27 hours to transport
you from Manchester to the Netherlands.

180
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,917
If you want to help your wife,
you should get moving.

181
00:13:28,253 --> 00:13:29,379
Okay, Inspector Clouseau,

182
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:31,715
let's see what these elite troops
of yours can do.

183
00:13:32,382 --> 00:13:33,382
Come on, guys, let's go.

184
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:37,428
Agent Roussel,

185
00:13:38,388 --> 00:13:40,515
I don't have to remind
you of the importance of this.

186
00:13:41,225 --> 00:13:43,769
- No, ma'am.
- And don't doubt what he's capable of.

187
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:45,519
I won't, sir.

188
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:13,757
<i>- Take a left on Kirkland Avenue.
- Yes.</i>

189
00:14:17,469 --> 00:14:20,722
What a pretty little town.
Old, narrow streets,

190
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:22,808
buildings nice and close,

191
00:14:23,308 --> 00:14:25,727
lots of great views
from all those windows.

192
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:27,354
This route's been wiped clean for us.

193
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:28,438
Nothing to worry about.

194
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:29,898
Is that right?

195
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,733
How's that nose of yours doing?

196
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,537
<i>Take a diversion route.</i>

197
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:45,539
Got a boyfriend, Roussie?
Significant other?

198
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:47,874
I need you to be quiet, Mr. Kincaid.

199
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:50,043
I'm just saying,
now might be the perfect time

200
00:14:50,127 --> 00:14:52,254
to write one of those
"I'll always love you" texts.

201
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,302
Relax, motherfucker.

202
00:14:58,385 --> 00:15:00,846
If you hear the shot,
it wasn't meant for you.

203
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:05,600
<i>Two-two-one,
ten-four en route.</i>

204
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:30,709
Fuck!

205
00:15:30,792 --> 00:15:32,169
Cover me!

206
00:15:32,252 --> 00:15:33,378
Move! Move!

207
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,763
Cover me!

208
00:16:00,989 --> 00:16:03,784
Move! Move!
Go! Get that door open!

209
00:16:04,284 --> 00:16:06,995
Go! Go! Alpha Squad, with me!

210
00:16:07,412 --> 00:16:09,373
Agent Roberts, protect the witness!

211
00:16:15,212 --> 00:16:16,546
Parker, take the left flank!

212
00:16:28,975 --> 00:16:30,811
Shit! We need more backup!

213
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,565
Follow me!

214
00:16:35,649 --> 00:16:37,067
Fuck!

215
00:16:58,295 --> 00:17:01,215
Agent Roussel!
God damn it, somebody!

216
00:17:01,298 --> 00:17:02,591
We need backup n...

217
00:17:09,098 --> 00:17:10,098
Turn around!

218
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:11,308
It's ready!

219
00:17:11,392 --> 00:17:12,518
Come on!

220
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:24,447
Lay down some cover fire.

221
00:17:54,685 --> 00:17:56,312
Fuck!

222
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:18,167
- Show me your hands!
- Bitch, please!

223
00:18:20,002 --> 00:18:21,462
- Put these on.
- Fuck that.

224
00:18:21,712 --> 00:18:23,297
Interpol's compromised. You know that.

225
00:18:24,715 --> 00:18:26,800
Either you shoot me or watch me bleed out.

226
00:18:34,183 --> 00:18:35,434
We gotta get off the street.

227
00:18:35,518 --> 00:18:37,038
There's a safe house
not far from here.

228
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:44,777
<i>As a car bomb has
exploded in Bishopgate Green,</i>

229
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:46,779
<i>near Coventry City Center...</i>

230
00:18:50,866 --> 00:18:53,702
Don't even think
about answering that fucking phone!

231
00:18:54,745 --> 00:18:56,585
The only way Dukhovich
could've known our route

232
00:18:56,789 --> 00:18:58,457
was if he had somebody on the inside.

233
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,669
Now, I need medical supplies,
and you need help.

234
00:19:02,127 --> 00:19:03,629
So, if you're gonna call somebody,

235
00:19:03,712 --> 00:19:05,923
they have to be totally out of the loop.

236
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,178
I've had
the Black Diamond service

237
00:19:11,262 --> 00:19:12,721
four times now, you understand?

238
00:19:13,222 --> 00:19:15,391
Four times. The car still
smells like a cemetery.

239
00:19:15,599 --> 00:19:18,561
Are you washing the car with old assholes?

240
00:19:19,395 --> 00:19:20,646
Or...

241
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:22,106
Just help me to understand.

242
00:19:24,817 --> 00:19:25,817
Just a second here.

243
00:19:27,528 --> 00:19:28,696
Hello, Amelia.

244
00:19:28,988 --> 00:19:30,656
I'm texting you an address in Coventry.

245
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:32,467
You need to get there immediately.

246
00:19:32,491 --> 00:19:34,410
Bring three units of O-negative blood.

247
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,413
I'm doing very well, thank you.
How are you?

248
00:19:37,788 --> 00:19:39,748
I don't have
the time for this, Michael.

249
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,458
I have a job I need you to do.

250
00:19:42,334 --> 00:19:44,837
- Pass.
- I wasn't offering. I'm telling you.

251
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,380
I have a job you're going to do.

252
00:19:46,463 --> 00:19:48,757
<i>I'm not gonna let you charm me
into this one, Amelia.</i>

253
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:50,259
Okay, let's be clear.

254
00:19:50,676 --> 00:19:52,362
I'm not any happier about this
than you are,

255
00:19:52,386 --> 00:19:53,637
but I don't have a choice.

256
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:55,598
Well, thank God I do.

257
00:19:56,098 --> 00:19:57,098
<i>No, Michael, you don't.</i>

258
00:19:57,516 --> 00:19:59,351
<i>Because if you're not
where I need you to be,</i>

259
00:19:59,435 --> 00:20:01,437
<i>I'm going to expose
you and your work to Interpol.</i>

260
00:20:01,895 --> 00:20:04,523
That elite Triple-A status
you want back so badly,

261
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:07,662
- I'll make sure you never get near it.
- You're threatening me now?

262
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,862
Not you, her. Are you threatening...

263
00:20:09,945 --> 00:20:12,105
You can't just threaten me
into taking orders from you.

264
00:20:12,156 --> 00:20:15,093
I guess we'll see. You're three hours
away. I'll see you in two and a half.

265
00:20:15,117 --> 00:20:17,745
Three... Okay, okay.
I guess we will. Jesus Christ.

266
00:20:18,203 --> 00:20:20,623
Here, we're gonna load
all these into the car, okay?

267
00:20:20,914 --> 00:20:23,274
We're gonna take the car out in the front,
and then burn it.

268
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:26,545
This place is like a war zone.

269
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,088
We got bodies everywhere.

270
00:20:28,172 --> 00:20:30,007
Our unit's compromised. Everyone's down.

271
00:20:30,507 --> 00:20:31,550
Get those guys IDed.

272
00:20:31,842 --> 00:20:33,510
And I've got no sign of Agent Roussel.

273
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:36,597
Maybe 15 to 20
dead mercenaries, heavily armed.

274
00:20:37,097 --> 00:20:38,599
Media circus is in town.

275
00:20:39,183 --> 00:20:40,263
That's not the worst of it.

276
00:20:43,312 --> 00:20:44,312
Kincaid is gone.

277
00:20:46,148 --> 00:20:47,775
Coventry, every available agent.

278
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,902
Report back to me with any updates.

279
00:20:50,235 --> 00:20:51,235
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

280
00:20:53,864 --> 00:20:54,904
There must've been a leak.

281
00:20:55,699 --> 00:20:58,369
I told you, there are too many
agencies involved.

282
00:20:58,577 --> 00:20:59,577
Get to The Hague.

283
00:20:59,912 --> 00:21:01,432
See what you can get out of Dukhovich.

284
00:21:01,872 --> 00:21:02,872
I'll try.

285
00:21:03,374 --> 00:21:05,376
And alert the penitentiary in Amsterdam.

286
00:21:05,834 --> 00:21:07,754
Have them triple the guard
around Kincaid's wife.

287
00:21:08,253 --> 00:21:09,253
Got it.

288
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,822
Mrs. Kincaid, your attorney.

289
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,320
Did I tell you you could turn around?

290
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,473
What do you want,
you useless piece of shit?

291
00:22:01,974 --> 00:22:03,684
Baby, baby, it's me.

292
00:22:03,767 --> 00:22:05,978
My bad.

293
00:22:06,603 --> 00:22:07,771
What do you want,

294
00:22:07,855 --> 00:22:10,607
you fucking <i>hijo de puta</i> motherfucker!

295
00:22:11,191 --> 00:22:12,526
I just wanted to hear your voice.

296
00:22:12,609 --> 00:22:13,609
Fuck you!

297
00:22:14,194 --> 00:22:16,280
There, you heard my voice.

298
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:20,200
<i>The only reason I'm in this shit hole
is so that they can get to your sorry ass!</i>

299
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:23,871
How you doing? Made a shank yet?

300
00:22:23,954 --> 00:22:24,872
<i>What for?</i>

301
00:22:24,955 --> 00:22:26,795
It's prison, baby.
You got to protect yourself.

302
00:22:27,249 --> 00:22:29,001
It's a Dutch prison, Darius!

303
00:22:29,084 --> 00:22:30,878
What are they gonna do,
beat me with a clog?

304
00:22:31,295 --> 00:22:32,588
You got a view at least?

305
00:22:33,005 --> 00:22:35,674
<i>Just a whole lot of corny Dutch buildings.</i>

306
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:40,095
There's one
with a huge fucking clock on it.

307
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:42,431
Like that's what I need right now.

308
00:22:42,514 --> 00:22:44,308
Do they have those flowers you love?

309
00:22:44,391 --> 00:22:47,603
Irises?
They come from there, right?

310
00:22:47,686 --> 00:22:49,772
Fucking tulips, Darius.

311
00:22:49,855 --> 00:22:52,941
<i>What kind of a piece-of-shit husband</i>

312
00:22:53,025 --> 00:22:55,277
<i>doesn't remember
his wife's favorite flowers?</i>

313
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:57,362
<i>You never remember anything.</i>

314
00:22:57,654 --> 00:22:59,072
What's our anniversary?

315
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:00,657
I'm gonna make this up to you, baby.

316
00:23:00,741 --> 00:23:03,076
<i>You see, that's what
I'm talking about,</i> cabrón.

317
00:23:05,078 --> 00:23:06,371
Darius, is something wrong?

318
00:23:08,373 --> 00:23:12,628
Not a thing, baby. Not a fucking thing.

319
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:16,924
Then I want to hear it.

- Hello? Sonia?
- Hello? Darius!

325
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:46,537
You fucking piece of shit!

326
00:23:49,706 --> 00:23:51,166
You fucking shit!

327
00:24:20,195 --> 00:24:21,875
Go ahead,
you might as well finish the job.

328
00:24:34,167 --> 00:24:35,294
Why am I here, Amelia?

329
00:24:36,086 --> 00:24:37,212
A high-value transport.

330
00:24:38,839 --> 00:24:41,967
Oh, high value? Oh, I don't...

331
00:24:42,843 --> 00:24:45,554
I don't really do high value anymore.
These days I'm more in the...

332
00:24:46,513 --> 00:24:48,098
mid-level coked-out attorney market.

333
00:24:48,974 --> 00:24:50,058
Why do you think that is?

334
00:24:50,142 --> 00:24:51,602
Seriously, Michael?

335
00:24:51,685 --> 00:24:52,685
Because of you.

336
00:24:52,728 --> 00:24:55,647
You used me to climb the Interpol ladder,
and here we are again.

337
00:24:58,859 --> 00:24:59,860
You up for a promotion?

338
00:25:00,402 --> 00:25:02,964
You have to blame me for every little bump
in your road, don't you.

339
00:25:02,988 --> 00:25:05,240
No, these aren't bumps. No, no, no bumps.

340
00:25:05,324 --> 00:25:07,534
Just one dead Japanese arms dealer.

341
00:25:08,327 --> 00:25:09,846
- I had nothing to do...
- "...to do with."

342
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,038
Do you know what happens

343
00:25:11,121 --> 00:25:13,999
when a Triple-A rated
executive protection agent

344
00:25:14,082 --> 00:25:15,000
loses a client?

345
00:25:15,083 --> 00:25:17,711
Triple-A. I was up here, yeah?

346
00:25:17,794 --> 00:25:19,546
Then I opened up to you. Why wouldn't I?

347
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:20,714
I was in love with you.

348
00:25:21,256 --> 00:25:22,674
And I fucking told you his name.

349
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:26,470
It was the first time in my entire career
I revealed a client's name.

350
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,720
I trusted you.

351
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:33,352
Now I'm down here. The dead guy's up here.

352
00:25:35,479 --> 00:25:37,814
I'm sorry, Michael,
you hit a rough patch.

353
00:25:37,898 --> 00:25:39,066
"A rough..."

354
00:25:39,149 --> 00:25:43,153
A 300-pound investment banker's ass
exploded four bags of heroin

355
00:25:43,236 --> 00:25:44,738
in the backseat of my car last week.

356
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:46,657
Those aren't leather seats,
those are cloth.

357
00:25:46,907 --> 00:25:48,593
- Okay, Michael...
- Want you to take a minute

358
00:25:48,617 --> 00:25:50,136
to think of what that clean-up might be.

359
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,013
I don't have the time
for your insane shit, okay?

360
00:25:52,037 --> 00:25:53,372
At that point, you sell the car.

361
00:25:53,455 --> 00:25:54,849
- I never used you!
- The depreciation...

362
00:25:54,873 --> 00:25:56,083
I just left you!

363
00:26:00,379 --> 00:26:03,215
Because you couldn't forgive me
for something I didn't even do.

364
00:26:11,932 --> 00:26:13,016
Transport is in there.

365
00:26:16,978 --> 00:26:17,978
Is that blood, dude...

366
00:26:19,606 --> 00:26:21,400
What the fuck?

367
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:41,169
You know how long
I've been waiting for this?

368
00:26:43,505 --> 00:26:44,798
Oh, no, no. I'm not gonna look.

369
00:26:46,717 --> 00:26:47,884
Motherfucker!

370
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:59,062
Hey, hey, hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's talk about this, okay?

371
00:26:59,146 --> 00:27:03,608
Even a dumbass like you is smart enough
to keep one in the... pipe.

372
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,153
Oh, shit.

373
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:08,113
And nighty night.

374
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:11,950
- Darius Kincaid. Jesus Christ.
- ...Michael.

375
00:27:12,033 --> 00:27:14,035
This is who you want me to protect?
My shirt!

376
00:27:15,579 --> 00:27:16,579
Fine, fine.

377
00:27:17,247 --> 00:27:18,874
You get the feet, I'll get the nostrils.

378
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:22,502
<i>The trial
of former Belarusian President</i>

379
00:27:22,586 --> 00:27:25,922
<i>Vladislav Dukhovich
took an uncertain turn this week,</i>

380
00:27:26,173 --> 00:27:27,424
<i>having recently survived</i>

381
00:27:27,507 --> 00:27:31,219
<i>a dioxin poisoning attempt
that left his face disfigured.</i>

382
00:27:31,303 --> 00:27:34,389
<i>- Authorities are keeping Dukhovich...</i>
- Interpol wishes to have a word.

383
00:27:34,973 --> 00:27:36,975
Quite the dust-up in Coventry
this morning.

384
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:39,848
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

385
00:27:42,564 --> 00:27:44,900
You've come here to lodge a complaint?

386
00:27:44,983 --> 00:27:48,153
I've come for my money.
I delivered as promised.

387
00:27:48,487 --> 00:27:50,989
I gave you Kincaid as exposed
as you'll ever get him.

388
00:27:51,948 --> 00:27:53,033
Small security detail,

389
00:27:53,283 --> 00:27:54,826
practically a rookie leading them.

390
00:27:55,243 --> 00:27:57,996
I can't do more than that.
Let's be fair here.

391
00:28:08,298 --> 00:28:11,802
You think it's fair
that you want something for nothing?

392
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,638
In my country...

393
00:28:15,347 --> 00:28:17,599
...we would skin you like a cat.

394
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:20,227
Would that be fair?

395
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:26,775
I come from nothing. I work all my life...

396
00:28:27,192 --> 00:28:28,735
serving the people.

397
00:28:29,778 --> 00:28:31,947
And then they come into my country

398
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,490
and they took it all away!

399
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,744
And now they lock me up like a rat,

400
00:28:38,495 --> 00:28:39,746
feed me poison!

401
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,290
Is this fair?

402
00:28:44,417 --> 00:28:46,294
When Kincaid is dead,

403
00:28:49,464 --> 00:28:50,799
you'll be paid in full.

404
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:55,249
You know he's a murderer, right?

405
00:28:55,303 --> 00:28:56,763
You're playing nurse to a murderer.

406
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:58,431
- A witness. Mmm-hmm.
- Really?

407
00:28:59,224 --> 00:29:00,224
Twenty-seven times.

408
00:29:01,101 --> 00:29:03,701
That's how many times this asshole
has tried to kill me, 27... 28!

409
00:29:03,979 --> 00:29:05,230
Fucking Prague!

410
00:29:05,939 --> 00:29:07,232
If Dukhovich is acquitted,

411
00:29:07,732 --> 00:29:09,192
he'll be back in power next week.

412
00:29:09,484 --> 00:29:10,610
I won't let that happen.

413
00:29:10,694 --> 00:29:11,694
Good.

414
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,390
You should take him to The Hague.

415
00:29:13,572 --> 00:29:14,572
I can't!

416
00:29:14,614 --> 00:29:16,157
There's a mole inside Interpol.

417
00:29:16,366 --> 00:29:18,410
- It's already cost me 12 good officers.
- Good?

418
00:29:19,327 --> 00:29:22,455
That's subjective.
Nice. Maybe they were nice.

419
00:29:23,498 --> 00:29:26,585
I'll make it simple for you;
If I stay near him, they'll find him.

420
00:29:26,668 --> 00:29:29,337
So I gotta risk my life
protecting this coffin magnet over here?

421
00:29:29,421 --> 00:29:30,773
No, no, no. You gotta put something

422
00:29:30,797 --> 00:29:32,277
- in the pot.
- How about your career?

423
00:29:32,382 --> 00:29:33,925
- How about it?
- Your precious career.

424
00:29:34,009 --> 00:29:35,427
You do this job for me,

425
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:38,680
and I'll get you back to elite status.

426
00:29:39,723 --> 00:29:41,003
Yeah, you don't have that power.

427
00:29:41,683 --> 00:29:42,767
I've got connections.

428
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:45,729
You want back in? I can put you there.

429
00:29:45,812 --> 00:29:46,855
Why would I trust you?

430
00:29:49,065 --> 00:29:50,065
Why?

431
00:29:52,777 --> 00:29:54,529
Because I've never lied to you, Michael.

432
00:29:56,281 --> 00:29:59,200
You're terrible at almost everything,

433
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:02,704
but you're good at keeping people alive.

434
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:05,540
Keep him alive... please,

435
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,835
and you get your dream life back.

436
00:30:10,003 --> 00:30:12,505
And as bonus,
you'll never hear from me again.

437
00:30:16,384 --> 00:30:17,384
Good.

438
00:30:22,724 --> 00:30:23,724
Still.

439
00:30:34,069 --> 00:30:35,153
<i>Where are you?</i>

440
00:30:35,236 --> 00:30:37,739
Setting up operation
at Coventry police headquarters.

441
00:30:37,948 --> 00:30:39,199
You got nothing from Dukhovich?

442
00:30:39,282 --> 00:30:40,367
Are you surprised?

443
00:30:40,450 --> 00:30:41,284
- Ma'am?
- Busy.

444
00:30:41,368 --> 00:30:43,304
I've picked up activity
at our safe house in town.

445
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:45,008
Is this something
I need to know right now?

446
00:30:45,038 --> 00:30:46,998
No, not normally.
But, yes, it should be vacant.

447
00:30:47,082 --> 00:30:48,291
<i>And you believe it's not?</i>

448
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:50,210
<i>Well, the access code
was activated</i>

449
00:30:50,293 --> 00:30:51,836
<i>without identity authorization.</i>

450
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,421
Could Kincaid have gotten inside?

451
00:30:53,505 --> 00:30:55,048
But it's on a revolving encryption.

452
00:30:57,008 --> 00:30:58,426
Get a team over there. Now!

453
00:30:59,803 --> 00:31:01,221
And where is Agent Roussel?

454
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,014
<i>Sorry, got to go.</i>

455
00:31:03,098 --> 00:31:04,098
Good luck.

456
00:31:11,648 --> 00:31:13,483
I believe I know where Kincaid is.

457
00:31:42,387 --> 00:31:43,888
What the fuck is all this?

458
00:31:44,139 --> 00:31:45,139
You're a fugitive.

459
00:31:45,557 --> 00:31:46,599
Fugitives wear restraints.

460
00:31:46,683 --> 00:31:48,143
No, no, no, not the cuffs.

461
00:31:48,226 --> 00:31:51,062
I'm talking about these whack-ass,
hipster clothes I'm wearing.

462
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:52,512
Yeah, luckily I brought extra.

463
00:31:52,689 --> 00:31:54,107
Lucky for who?

464
00:31:55,316 --> 00:31:57,360
Shit. Am I wearing underwear?

465
00:31:57,569 --> 00:32:00,089
Those are for me too,
in case I have to change your pants again.

466
00:32:00,155 --> 00:32:01,406
Not a fan.

467
00:32:01,489 --> 00:32:03,658
You know they call them
swinging dicks for a reason.

468
00:32:04,117 --> 00:32:05,677
How about we never speak of this again?

469
00:32:10,415 --> 00:32:13,293
Shit. Interpol protocol.

470
00:32:13,918 --> 00:32:17,158
When that phone rings and nobody answers,
they're gonna send officers to the door.

471
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:19,758
And there they are.

472
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:23,413
Yes, we're setting our perimeter.

473
00:32:25,555 --> 00:32:26,555
Comfy?

474
00:32:26,723 --> 00:32:28,433
So, what happened
to little Miss Interpol?

475
00:32:28,933 --> 00:32:30,101
Agent Roussel's gone.

476
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,563
Damn! I liked her. She's spunky.

477
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,458
This building has two stairwells,

478
00:32:35,482 --> 00:32:36,751
- no fire escapes...
- No fire escapes

479
00:32:36,775 --> 00:32:38,193
and no adjacent rooftops.

480
00:32:38,276 --> 00:32:40,671
You know, you're not the only
observant motherfucker on the planet.

481
00:32:40,695 --> 00:32:41,863
I go through doors first.

482
00:32:41,946 --> 00:32:43,823
I check to see if it's clear,
then you follow.

483
00:32:43,907 --> 00:32:45,700
Really? You think that's necessary?

484
00:32:45,992 --> 00:32:49,954
- My job is to keep you out of harm's way.
- Shit, motherfucker.

485
00:32:50,955 --> 00:32:52,791
I am harm's way.

486
00:33:07,430 --> 00:33:08,932
Two hostiles, maybe more.

487
00:33:09,307 --> 00:33:10,767
I don't suppose I could have a gun?

488
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:13,019
No. We're gonna take
the north stairwell. Let's go.

489
00:33:14,312 --> 00:33:15,312
Fuck!

490
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:23,320
- It's him!
- Come on!

491
00:33:31,829 --> 00:33:32,829
Thank God you're here.

492
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:34,796
I don't know
what I would've done without you.

493
00:33:34,915 --> 00:33:36,375
Well done. Guess what happens now?

494
00:33:37,126 --> 00:33:38,877
Shots fired! Shots fired!

495
00:33:53,684 --> 00:33:55,561
<i>All units sending in nine-nine.</i>

496
00:33:59,857 --> 00:34:01,108
Now we have a new problem.

497
00:34:02,192 --> 00:34:04,570
I like to keep things
a little more subtle.

498
00:34:14,997 --> 00:34:16,999
See? Boring is better.

499
00:34:21,253 --> 00:34:23,422
Okay. That's very loud.

500
00:34:24,548 --> 00:34:25,591
It was empty anyway.

501
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:32,389
<i>We're identifying
heat signatures on the rooftop</i>

502
00:34:32,472 --> 00:34:33,807
<i>moving in a northbound direction.</i>

503
00:34:33,891 --> 00:34:35,893
Copy that! Go, go, go!
They're on the roof!

504
00:34:38,353 --> 00:34:40,272
No, no, no. No odds in that jump.

505
00:34:40,355 --> 00:34:42,584
It beats the hell out of whatever's
gonna come through that door.

506
00:34:42,608 --> 00:34:44,568
No. Just gotta...

507
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:47,779
We just gotta find
a more intelligent way...

508
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:53,702
Motherfucker! Ahh! Shit!

509
00:34:55,662 --> 00:34:57,122
Holy fucking shit.

510
00:34:57,206 --> 00:35:00,292
Secure the roof! Go, go, go!
Delta squad with me!

511
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:02,586
- They're on the north side!
- Copy that!

512
00:35:10,427 --> 00:35:12,054
Made that jump on one leg.

513
00:35:12,346 --> 00:35:14,723
I made that jump
without jumping. Let's go.

514
00:35:15,307 --> 00:35:16,387
So, what's your next trick,

515
00:35:16,725 --> 00:35:18,560
showing me how we escape without escaping?

516
00:35:18,644 --> 00:35:21,284
Let's just try to get to the car
without killing anyone, all right?

517
00:35:21,897 --> 00:35:24,650
- Is this your car?
- One of them.

518
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:26,360
I remember
shooting at you in a Jaguar.

519
00:35:26,443 --> 00:35:28,320
Buckle up. If we get
in a high-speed chase,

520
00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:29,321
I want you strapped in.

521
00:35:29,404 --> 00:35:31,573
I'm more worried
about the wheels coming off this bitch

522
00:35:31,657 --> 00:35:33,659
when you reach the speed limit.

523
00:35:34,993 --> 00:35:35,827
Back in the day,

524
00:35:35,911 --> 00:35:37,871
we wouldn't have even stolen
this piece of shit,

525
00:35:37,955 --> 00:35:39,915
and we stole everything.
I remember one night...

526
00:35:39,998 --> 00:35:42,584
I know all I need to know about you.
All your early arrests,

527
00:35:43,043 --> 00:35:45,688
your father in and out of prison,
you following in the same footsteps.

528
00:35:45,712 --> 00:35:47,965
Did your little research, did you?

529
00:35:48,507 --> 00:35:50,342
Prepare for a test,
there are no surprises.

530
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:53,303
And you grew up wanting to be a cop

531
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:55,389
till you found out
wasn't no money in that shit.

532
00:35:55,722 --> 00:35:58,100
So you joined the CIA,
sharpened your skills,

533
00:35:58,183 --> 00:35:59,893
then decided to open your own shop,

534
00:36:00,143 --> 00:36:01,937
pimp yourself out to the fat cats.

535
00:36:02,437 --> 00:36:04,815
I didn't even have to do
no research to know that shit.

536
00:36:05,482 --> 00:36:06,922
It's written all over your punk-ass.

537
00:36:07,985 --> 00:36:10,570
Can't wait to hear what I'll do next.
That's great.

538
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,780
You know, why don't...

539
00:36:14,366 --> 00:36:16,344
Why don't you lay back
and keep from getting spotted.

540
00:36:16,368 --> 00:36:17,202
Get comfortable.

541
00:36:17,286 --> 00:36:19,579
That's a good idea.

542
00:36:23,709 --> 00:36:25,335
Smells like ass back here!

543
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:28,630
Bet that Jag never smelled like ass.

544
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,508
These your electrolytes?

545
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,831
Facial recognition
identifies this man

546
00:37:02,914 --> 00:37:04,416
as Michael Bryce.

547
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:07,252
But you already know that,
don't you, Agent Roussel?

548
00:37:08,211 --> 00:37:09,379
You two have a history.

549
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:11,465
Long time ago.

550
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:13,759
You slipped Kincaid
into our own safe house,

551
00:37:13,842 --> 00:37:15,010
then brought in this...

552
00:37:16,136 --> 00:37:17,721
Executive protection agent?

553
00:37:21,892 --> 00:37:24,686
Official channels had been compromised.
What did you expect me to do?

554
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:27,189
Clearly, our office security's
been breached.

555
00:37:27,564 --> 00:37:30,650
The red notice stays.
You, however, can go.

556
00:37:31,276 --> 00:37:32,277
I'm placing you on leave.

557
00:37:32,569 --> 00:37:34,863
You will surrender
your weapon and credentials.

558
00:37:35,447 --> 00:37:36,948
You are going to be telling

559
00:37:37,032 --> 00:37:38,784
this story for years, Amelia,

560
00:37:39,618 --> 00:37:41,161
from inside a very large office

561
00:37:42,162 --> 00:37:43,413
or a very small cell.

562
00:37:43,747 --> 00:37:46,708
Well, I like my odds.

563
00:37:48,126 --> 00:37:50,366
The only way Bryce and Kincaid
don't make it to The Hague

564
00:37:51,004 --> 00:37:52,324
is if they kill each other first.

565
00:37:54,216 --> 00:37:55,216
Amelia.

566
00:37:56,635 --> 00:37:57,969
She's making a mistake.

567
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,013
We need to plug our leak.

568
00:38:00,764 --> 00:38:03,141
Now, this Bryce, do you trust him?

569
00:38:03,975 --> 00:38:05,352
With something like this, yes.

570
00:38:06,812 --> 00:38:07,896
I'll speak to Casoria,

571
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,482
get her to allow you to come
to The Hague with us.

572
00:38:11,108 --> 00:38:12,609
But no more secrets.

573
00:38:14,027 --> 00:38:15,028
Thank you, sir.

574
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:27,874
Search for car, plate FJ56MHV.

575
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:30,877
They'll have identified the car
with the traffic cams by now.

576
00:38:30,961 --> 00:38:33,380
And you. Welcome to fugitive life.

577
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:34,965
Until I turn you in.

578
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:37,259
Just need to find a different vehicle,

579
00:38:37,717 --> 00:38:40,595
older model, no alarm. Right here.

580
00:38:42,347 --> 00:38:44,182
Luckily, I came prepared.

581
00:38:46,893 --> 00:38:49,893
You know, if you're gonna be a while,
I can just go in there and get a room.

582
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,565
There's an art to low-impact,

583
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:54,943
high-efficiency
breaking and entering, but...

584
00:38:58,989 --> 00:38:59,990
Art's subjective.

585
00:39:01,116 --> 00:39:02,156
And you're bleeding again.

586
00:39:02,701 --> 00:39:04,554
You know, for a dude
that runs around killing people,

587
00:39:04,578 --> 00:39:06,621
you've got this really strange
thing about bleeding.

588
00:39:06,705 --> 00:39:09,875
It's inefficient.
And I don't kill people, I protect them.

589
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:11,251
Hector Ramirez.

590
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:15,005
Hector Ramirez was an assassin.

591
00:39:15,088 --> 00:39:16,423
Yeah, I know. I trained him.

592
00:39:16,506 --> 00:39:18,425
Who was holding a knife
to my client's throat.

593
00:39:18,508 --> 00:39:19,593
And you killed him.

594
00:39:19,843 --> 00:39:22,095
No. I saved my client.

595
00:39:22,387 --> 00:39:24,574
I think Hector might have
a different perspective on that.

596
00:39:24,598 --> 00:39:26,516
Oh, is that so? Well, here's the thing.

597
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:28,685
I was a Triple-A rated
executive protection agent.

598
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,188
- You just made up that Triple-A shit.
- No, I did not!

599
00:39:31,271 --> 00:39:33,148
And if guys like you...
If sociopaths like you

600
00:39:33,231 --> 00:39:36,043
weren't running around trying to kill
my clients, then no one would get hurt.

601
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,546
Triple-A, yeah. It sounds like you ought
to be selling life insurance

602
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,006
or fixing my fucking transmission,
or something.

603
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,340
Well,
you're uninsurable, trust me.

604
00:39:41,364 --> 00:39:42,532
And you said "was."

605
00:39:42,616 --> 00:39:45,428
- "I was a Triple-A, X-rated dickhead!"
- No, I said "am." Get in the fucking car!

606
00:39:45,452 --> 00:39:46,912
Get in the fucking car!

607
00:39:50,624 --> 00:39:52,501
Jesus fucking Christ.

608
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:55,420
You definitely said "was."

609
00:39:55,795 --> 00:39:57,255
"Was" as in,

610
00:39:57,631 --> 00:40:00,592
"I used to be a Triple-X
dickhead driving a Jag,

611
00:40:00,675 --> 00:40:02,594
but now I'm rolling around
in this shit-wagon."

612
00:40:02,677 --> 00:40:03,970
Put your seatbelt on.

613
00:40:04,054 --> 00:40:06,640
What happened? Lose your edge?

614
00:40:07,057 --> 00:40:11,102
Drop focus? You slip up
and let a client get popped?

615
00:40:11,186 --> 00:40:12,229
Never slipped up.

616
00:40:13,104 --> 00:40:15,565
Well, how did "am" become "was"?

617
00:40:16,942 --> 00:40:20,779
I don't actually know. I mean,
how does a so-called expert assassin

618
00:40:21,071 --> 00:40:23,240
get busted by Interpol?

619
00:40:23,532 --> 00:40:25,367
Love, baby. Straight-up love.

620
00:40:26,952 --> 00:40:29,538
<i>See, I'm doing
this job in Geneva, right?</i>

621
00:40:29,746 --> 00:40:31,540
<i>Some dude washing the wrong dude's money.</i>

622
00:40:31,623 --> 00:40:32,623
<i>I get a call.</i>

623
00:40:33,124 --> 00:40:33,959
What?

624
00:40:34,042 --> 00:40:35,460
<i>My wife's been in a car accident,</i>

625
00:40:35,544 --> 00:40:36,545
<i>- Bad one.</i>
- What?

626
00:40:36,628 --> 00:40:39,798
<i>So, Geneva dude gets a pass,
I jet back to Mexico City,</i>

627
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:42,634
<i>go straight to the hospital.
Bopped up in Sonia's room,</i>

628
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,928
<i>two dozen agents waiting for me.</i>

629
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:52,059
Played by the heart.

630
00:40:52,811 --> 00:40:54,396
Happens to the best of us, man.

631
00:40:54,604 --> 00:40:57,524
I mean, sort of like how
Agent Roussel took you from here

632
00:40:58,066 --> 00:41:00,277
to here... to here.

633
00:41:00,527 --> 00:41:03,655
Assassin and eavesdropper.
You're a real double threat.

634
00:41:04,364 --> 00:41:07,176
Well, you were whining like a bitch
so loud, I heard you through the wall.

635
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,119
Agent Roussel and I
aren't any of your concern.

636
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:11,705
So, she dumped you because
of all your tight-assed,

637
00:41:12,289 --> 00:41:14,416
"Boring is good, look before you leap,

638
00:41:14,499 --> 00:41:15,518
put your seatbelt on" shit?

639
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:16,459
She didn't dump me.

640
00:41:16,543 --> 00:41:19,379
Oh, motherfucker, I know she dumped you.

641
00:41:19,462 --> 00:41:21,548
I'm just perusing all the reasons why,

642
00:41:21,631 --> 00:41:23,758
and there's a plethora
of those motherfuckers.

643
00:41:24,718 --> 00:41:26,344
- Plethora?
- Yeah. It means a lot.

644
00:41:26,428 --> 00:41:29,097
I know what plethora means!
It just doesn't apply here!

645
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,518
And not jumping off the top of a roof,
that's logical, that's safe.

646
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:36,479
You know, wearing a seatbelt:
logical, safe.

647
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,840
Let me ask you something,
how many times have you been shot?

648
00:41:40,567 --> 00:41:41,610
- Counting today?
- Yeah.

649
00:41:42,694 --> 00:41:44,279
- Too many to count. You?
- Yeah, I bet.

650
00:41:44,362 --> 00:41:45,362
Zero.

651
00:41:45,530 --> 00:41:47,157
Now, we both know that's bullshit.

652
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,493
That's not bullshit, okay?
This was a little flesh wound.

653
00:41:50,577 --> 00:41:52,096
You just kind of zinged it right there.

654
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,848
<i>Didn't even require a Band-Aid.
You got lucky.</i>

655
00:41:53,872 --> 00:41:56,833
<i>Yeah, the rock shifted
just as I took the shot.</i>

656
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,127
<i>- You lucky motherfucker.</i>
- Fuck!

657
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:00,210
Fuck!

658
00:42:00,712 --> 00:42:01,712
Fucking Prague.

659
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:03,673
Yeah, Prague.

660
00:42:03,757 --> 00:42:05,237
You never even took one for a client?

661
00:42:05,425 --> 00:42:06,760
Nope. Never had to.

662
00:42:06,843 --> 00:42:08,428
Yeah, but the question is, would you?

663
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,180
See, if I'm paying Triple-A rates,

664
00:42:10,263 --> 00:42:12,891
then I'm looking
for that full-service shit,

665
00:42:12,974 --> 00:42:13,974
you know what I'm saying?

666
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:16,061
That extra "A" stands for "ass,"

667
00:42:16,436 --> 00:42:18,563
yours, between mine and a bullet.

668
00:42:18,647 --> 00:42:20,482
Being prepared for everything

669
00:42:20,565 --> 00:42:22,335
means that that situation statistically
just won't occur.

670
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:24,444
Bryce, you cannot be
prepared for everything!

671
00:42:24,527 --> 00:42:26,446
Life is gonna bloody us up, okay?

672
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:29,491
You just gotta put a Band-Aid
on that shit and keep rolling!

673
00:42:30,659 --> 00:42:31,910
That's really beautiful, man.

674
00:42:32,327 --> 00:42:35,413
Do you ever just write stuff down?
I don't know, throw down a haiku or two?

675
00:42:36,373 --> 00:42:41,961
<i>♪ Life is a highway

676
00:42:43,004 --> 00:42:45,965

689
00:43:40,562 --> 00:43:42,147
How'd you like that, motherfucker?

690
00:43:49,779 --> 00:43:51,740
Do you have any idea how stupid you sound?

691
00:43:51,823 --> 00:43:53,491
I mean, what a fuck-up!

692
00:43:53,992 --> 00:43:56,286
You lost my husband, and you're like,

693
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:58,955
"Can you please help us find him?"

694
00:43:59,038 --> 00:44:00,790
Why the fuck should I?

695
00:44:00,874 --> 00:44:03,543
That is your fucking job, motherfucker!

696
00:44:03,793 --> 00:44:05,670
But, obviously, you suck at it.

697
00:44:09,424 --> 00:44:12,469
You received
a phone call today from your attorney.

698
00:44:12,552 --> 00:44:13,552
So?

699
00:44:14,179 --> 00:44:16,181
Well, we asked your attorney,

700
00:44:16,264 --> 00:44:19,100
but... he said he didn't have
any contact with you.

701
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:23,104
What? Are you fucking kidding me?

702
00:44:23,188 --> 00:44:25,982
Okay, that's it!
I've had it with this lawyer!

703
00:44:26,065 --> 00:44:29,486
He's an alcoholic.
He calls me completely drunk,

704
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:32,280
and he starts saying
the most inappropriate things.

705
00:44:32,363 --> 00:44:36,159
Like, for example,
what he likes to do to his wife's ass.

706
00:44:36,618 --> 00:44:40,330
That is a disgusting place
to hide a child's toy!

707
00:44:40,413 --> 00:44:41,414
And you know what?

708
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:43,500
I don't need to listen to this shit!

709
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:45,210
Then he forgets about it,

710
00:44:45,293 --> 00:44:47,378
but I'm stuck with the images in my head!

711
00:44:47,462 --> 00:44:48,462
Mrs. Kincaid,

712
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:51,424
if you know where your husband is,

713
00:44:51,508 --> 00:44:52,509
you need to tell us.

714
00:44:53,218 --> 00:44:54,344
It's for his own safety.

715
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:12,862
I'm sorr... You're worried
about my husband's safety?

716
00:45:14,364 --> 00:45:18,034
No one in this world
can kill Darius Kincaid.

717
00:45:19,202 --> 00:45:21,412
The man is a <i>cucaracha,</i>

718
00:45:22,247 --> 00:45:24,415
and I mean that
in every sense of the word.

719
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:29,796
Sometimes you just want to crush
his little, filthy head with your shoe,

720
00:45:30,588 --> 00:45:32,006
but he won't die.

721
00:45:32,298 --> 00:45:33,967
That motherfucker is unkillable,

722
00:45:34,175 --> 00:45:35,218
so you can relax.

723
00:45:37,971 --> 00:45:38,971
But wait, no.

724
00:45:39,556 --> 00:45:42,267
There is one important thing
that you should know.

725
00:45:50,483 --> 00:45:52,235
Motherfuckers, get out of my fucking cell.

726
00:45:54,195 --> 00:45:55,572
Great.

727
00:45:56,155 --> 00:45:57,155
Now!

728
00:45:57,282 --> 00:45:59,158
And I want that lawyer fired!

729
00:45:59,242 --> 00:46:02,537
I want that lawyer fired!
I want a good one, professional lawyer!

730
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:04,497
I have rights! Human rights!

731
00:46:12,171 --> 00:46:14,007
Okay, you can take a five-minute break.

732
00:46:31,107 --> 00:46:32,107
Good evening.

733
00:46:33,568 --> 00:46:34,569
Can I help you?

734
00:46:34,652 --> 00:46:36,112
We need to see your cameras.

735
00:46:36,821 --> 00:46:39,240
Sorry, sir, that's for management only.

736
00:46:55,089 --> 00:46:56,089
I got you!

737
00:47:01,179 --> 00:47:02,179
Where we at?

738
00:47:03,056 --> 00:47:04,057
I backtracked west.

739
00:47:05,141 --> 00:47:06,309
West is the wrong direction.

740
00:47:06,601 --> 00:47:08,478
Thank you. Thank you.

741
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:10,820
They'd be expecting us
to take a direct route.

742
00:47:10,939 --> 00:47:12,166
The fuck is that you're eating?

743
00:47:12,190 --> 00:47:13,190
Postpones fatigue.

744
00:47:14,025 --> 00:47:16,086
Refuels glycogen and electrolytes.
I got you one, too,

745
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:18,196
while you were taking
one of your world-class naps.

746
00:47:18,279 --> 00:47:19,989
I'd stay awake if you let me drive.

747
00:47:20,323 --> 00:47:22,043
Thank you. That's really generous of... No!

748
00:47:24,702 --> 00:47:25,702
I gotta piss.

749
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:26,913
Use that.

750
00:47:26,996 --> 00:47:28,623
Timeline's not built for another break.

751
00:47:30,166 --> 00:47:33,461
Your dick might fit
in here, but mine...

752
00:47:34,796 --> 00:47:37,840
Plus, I need every drop of this shit
to tolerate this ride with you.

753
00:47:38,549 --> 00:47:39,789
Just pull the fucking car over.

754
00:47:40,468 --> 00:47:41,636
Jesus Christ.

755
00:47:50,853 --> 00:47:52,855
It'd be a lot easier without these cuffs,

756
00:47:53,272 --> 00:47:54,524
or this fucking underwear.

757
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:16,670
Kincaid!

758
00:48:19,007 --> 00:48:20,842
Hey, asshole!

759
00:48:20,925 --> 00:48:23,886
Ugh! Fucking God damn it, that's not mud!

760
00:48:31,185 --> 00:48:32,385
You think I'm a fucking idiot?

761
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:33,979
Well...

762
00:48:35,356 --> 00:48:37,400
You did think that cheap whiskey was piss.

763
00:48:37,483 --> 00:48:38,735
Fuck!

764
00:48:40,194 --> 00:48:41,554
Where the hell did that come from?

765
00:48:41,779 --> 00:48:45,283
This is what happens
when you mess with a perfectly laid plan.

766
00:48:45,867 --> 00:48:48,578
- Give me a gun. Give me a goddamn gun!
- I got this! I got this!

767
00:48:52,415 --> 00:48:53,291
There's more than one.

768
00:48:53,374 --> 00:48:55,209
A-ha! Perfect deduction, Sherlock.

769
00:48:57,712 --> 00:48:59,464
Draw their fire so I can take a look.

770
00:48:59,756 --> 00:49:00,756
All right. Go!

771
00:49:03,843 --> 00:49:04,843
Ow!

772
00:49:05,303 --> 00:49:06,596
- Shit!
- Okay.

773
00:49:06,971 --> 00:49:09,766
Three shooters in a row, all lit up.

774
00:49:10,892 --> 00:49:12,185
So, what do you want to do?

775
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,899
While you can't come up with a plan,
they're gonna kill us.

776
00:49:18,232 --> 00:49:19,984
So here's the plan.

777
00:49:20,651 --> 00:49:23,112
- What the fuck?
- You take eleven o'clock, I'll take one.

778
00:49:23,488 --> 00:49:24,947
Let's see who gets to twelve first.

779
00:49:25,490 --> 00:49:27,825
Okay. On three. You ready?

780
00:49:28,534 --> 00:49:29,534
One...

781
00:49:38,086 --> 00:49:39,712
I said on three. You shot early.

782
00:49:39,796 --> 00:49:40,963
Yeah, before they did.

783
00:49:41,172 --> 00:49:42,172
Let me break it down...

784
00:49:54,477 --> 00:49:57,562
So much for your intricately
calculated travel plans.

785
00:49:58,021 --> 00:49:59,821
That's why I was trying
to bounce on your ass.

786
00:49:59,898 --> 00:50:01,108
See, I'm safer on my own.

787
00:50:01,358 --> 00:50:02,943
There's no way that they could've known

788
00:50:03,026 --> 00:50:05,278
- where we were.
- Well, they did, and now they're dead.

789
00:50:09,908 --> 00:50:11,348
This yours? Is this your cell phone?

790
00:50:11,827 --> 00:50:13,620
I might've taken that off some dead merc.

791
00:50:13,954 --> 00:50:14,954
You might've...

792
00:50:15,455 --> 00:50:16,975
You know, they can track a cell phone.

793
00:50:17,541 --> 00:50:21,503
That's why I use a ghost chip in mine,
so they can't track the phone.

794
00:50:21,837 --> 00:50:23,755
I mean, that's how they know
where we were!

795
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:26,675
Here I am, I'm plotting courses
all over the country,

796
00:50:26,758 --> 00:50:29,719
and you're carrying a location beacon
in your pocket!

797
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:31,679
My bad.

798
00:50:31,888 --> 00:50:32,888
Your bad?

799
00:50:33,473 --> 00:50:36,518
You don't even understand how
21st century technology works! I mean,

800
00:50:36,601 --> 00:50:38,854
how have you stayed alive this long?

801
00:50:38,937 --> 00:50:43,900
While all you guys are wasting your time
planning and aiming and deducing,

802
00:50:44,192 --> 00:50:45,193
I just do my thing,

803
00:50:45,527 --> 00:50:48,780
and my thing has always been better
than your fucking thing.

804
00:50:49,447 --> 00:50:50,866
Great. There you go.

805
00:50:52,117 --> 00:50:52,951
That's just great.

806
00:50:53,034 --> 00:50:55,453
I'm glad that your thing has
always been better than mine.

807
00:50:57,414 --> 00:50:58,599
You're not gonna take this gun?

808
00:50:58,623 --> 00:51:00,542
No, you keep that gun.
Use it to shoot me.

809
00:51:00,625 --> 00:51:02,425
No, no, no, I was gonna
shoot you with this...

810
00:51:03,503 --> 00:51:04,503
Shit!

811
00:51:14,264 --> 00:51:15,264
There go the guns.

812
00:51:15,849 --> 00:51:17,100
Well, look on the bright side.

813
00:51:18,101 --> 00:51:19,436
We get the bad guys' van.

814
00:51:40,832 --> 00:51:42,417
This field smells like your car.

815
00:51:44,461 --> 00:51:46,796
Dude, I said I was sorry about the phone.

816
00:51:47,589 --> 00:51:49,269
Who knows, maybe
your plan would've worked.

817
00:51:51,259 --> 00:51:53,112
- So, what about your other plan?
- There's no plan!

818
00:51:53,136 --> 00:51:55,889
The plan is we're in a cow pasture,
that's the plan.

819
00:51:56,264 --> 00:51:58,433
I'm talking about your Agent Roussel plan.

820
00:51:58,892 --> 00:52:00,977
That's why you're doing this, right?
Get her back?

821
00:52:03,063 --> 00:52:06,066
You think becoming
a Triple-A card-carrying dickhead

822
00:52:06,149 --> 00:52:09,986
is gonna give you an all-access
backstage pass to Agent Roussel's ass,

823
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:12,030
- and she'll fall in love.
- I get it.

824
00:52:12,113 --> 00:52:14,342
- You're gonna be the guy...
- And your life will have meaning again.

825
00:52:14,366 --> 00:52:16,469
...that the other inmates come to
for advice. They're very lucky.

826
00:52:16,493 --> 00:52:18,703
Motherfucker, please.

827
00:52:19,371 --> 00:52:22,165
I've eaten hamburgers
that know more about women than you.

828
00:52:22,582 --> 00:52:25,877
- You, my friend, are a romantic retard.
- Hey!

829
00:52:26,670 --> 00:52:28,213
Just 'cause I want to get my business

830
00:52:28,296 --> 00:52:30,336
back in order, that doesn't make me
a shitty person.

831
00:52:30,757 --> 00:52:34,594
And Amelia has nothing,
absolutely nothing, to do with this.

832
00:52:35,887 --> 00:52:39,641
Oh man. You are so in love, it is crazy.

833
00:52:39,724 --> 00:52:41,268
Christ, do you ever shut up?

834
00:52:42,852 --> 00:52:44,771
Why is everything always
about love with you?

835
00:52:45,272 --> 00:52:46,648
Well, what else is there?

836
00:52:47,315 --> 00:52:52,320
I mean, take away the guns, the money,
the travel, the perfect shot

837
00:52:52,404 --> 00:52:55,198
through a motherfucker's
earhole from 300 meters.

838
00:52:56,366 --> 00:52:59,202
I mean, none of that shit means dick
if I can't tell Sonia about it.

839
00:52:59,995 --> 00:53:02,205
Well, I guess Amelia's
just not as special as Sonia.

840
00:53:02,289 --> 00:53:03,540
She sounds great.

841
00:53:04,291 --> 00:53:05,834
- What, she cheat on you?
- No.

842
00:53:06,209 --> 00:53:07,919
- Try to kill you?
- No.

843
00:53:08,003 --> 00:53:10,880
'Cause Sonia chopped off part of my ear
with a machete one time.

844
00:53:10,964 --> 00:53:12,841
She sewed it back on, but...

845
00:53:13,758 --> 00:53:16,303
it was two, three days before
our shit got real again.

846
00:53:17,387 --> 00:53:18,947
Where'd you guys meet, ChristianMingle?

847
00:53:18,972 --> 00:53:20,515
No. A bar in Honduras.

848
00:53:21,308 --> 00:53:24,728
One of those places
where nobody knows your face and name.

00:55:18,550 --> 00:55:19,550
Need a ride?

873
00:55:19,717 --> 00:55:21,970
Yeah. We're trying to catch
a ferry to Amsterdam.

874
00:55:22,387 --> 00:55:23,697
- Yeah, I can get you there.
- Yeah?

875
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:24,556
Jump in.

876
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:27,434
Hey, hey, hey, there's eyes
all over Amsterdam for me.

877
00:55:27,517 --> 00:55:28,619
That's where Sonia's locked up.

878
00:55:28,643 --> 00:55:30,603
It's a quick in and out.
I got a place there.

879
00:55:30,687 --> 00:55:32,230
- You got a place in Amsterdam?
- Yeah.

880
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:33,970
Is that where you keep the Jag?

881
00:55:34,649 --> 00:55:36,409
You know what?
Why don't you go fuck yourself

882
00:55:36,484 --> 00:55:38,361
and the horse you... Hello.

883
00:55:41,698 --> 00:55:43,074
Hello, beautiful Sisters.

884
00:55:47,954 --> 00:55:49,164
Whose lap will I sit on?

885
00:57:13,748 --> 00:57:14,748
One more!

886
00:57:24,968 --> 00:57:26,010
Your stop, boys!

887
00:57:28,513 --> 00:57:30,932
You take care, sisters.

888
00:57:31,683 --> 00:57:32,850
Bye, Kincaid!

889
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:37,188
Go with God!

890
00:57:37,689 --> 00:57:39,983
This man's killed over 150 people.

891
00:57:40,066 --> 00:57:41,317
Two-fifty, easy.

892
00:57:42,193 --> 00:57:43,194
Yeah, but they love you.

893
00:57:43,987 --> 00:57:45,738
Me, they want to perform an exorcism on.

894
00:57:46,739 --> 00:57:47,859
Question for a higher power.

895
00:57:49,158 --> 00:57:50,201
Who is more wicked,

896
00:57:50,994 --> 00:57:52,829
he who kills evil motherfuckers

897
00:57:53,580 --> 00:57:54,789
or he who protects them?

898
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:09,279
You really believe you're the good guy?

899
00:58:16,811 --> 00:58:19,272
My first contract... I was...

900
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,858
I don't know, 16, 17.

901
00:58:23,484 --> 00:58:26,404
<i>There was a guy who broke into a church.</i>

902
00:58:27,947 --> 00:58:30,450
<i>The preacher was still there,
so he told the guy,</i>

903
00:58:30,533 --> 00:58:33,328
<i>"Look, you don't have to steal anything.
Take whatever you want."</i>

904
00:58:34,787 --> 00:58:36,027
<i>Dude wasn't there for the loot.</i>

905
00:58:36,539 --> 00:58:37,624
<i>He wanted to hurt somebody.</i>

906
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:44,964
<i>Slaughters the preacher,</i>

907
00:58:45,048 --> 00:58:48,593
<i>displays his body on the altar
for his congregation to see.</i>

908
00:58:59,812 --> 00:59:03,232
<i>The Bible says never to take revenge,</i>

909
00:59:05,735 --> 00:59:06,819
<i>to leave it to the Lord.</i>

910
00:59:10,490 --> 00:59:12,283
<i>But I wasn't prepared to wait that long.</i>

911
00:59:28,257 --> 00:59:32,637
So, when your moral compass
gets around to pointing at me,

912
00:59:33,638 --> 00:59:36,724
yeah, you'll be pointing
at one of the good guys.

913
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:40,107
And how does one
of the good guys get connected

914
00:59:40,144 --> 00:59:41,584
with a piece of shit like Dukhovich?

915
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:44,160
I didn't know everything
the dude was into.

916
00:59:44,315 --> 00:59:45,315
That's an easy excuse.

917
00:59:45,358 --> 00:59:47,586
Look, you know everything
about every client you ever had?

918
00:59:47,610 --> 00:59:50,697
Nope. I don't decide
whether my clients live or die.

When's the last time you paid rent
on this safe house?

926
01:00:31,446 --> 01:00:34,157
I haven't done a lot
of Amsterdam jobs lately.

927
01:00:34,991 --> 01:00:36,242
I just need to get my gear.

928
01:00:36,325 --> 01:00:40,079
The problem is that...
all the windows are polycarb.

929
01:00:40,163 --> 01:00:42,790
They have... extra layers of laminate,

930
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:45,477
and obviously there's
a Hetzger alarm system,

931
01:00:45,501 --> 01:00:47,211
which is the premiere unit on the market.

It's got three fail-safes.

933
01:00:50,631 --> 01:00:53,092
But if I can just...

934

We got four hours to court,
let's get cleaned up.

945
01:01:29,921 --> 01:01:31,839

Fuck!

950
01:01:41,682 --> 01:01:43,434
Counsel, approach the bench.

01:01:44,310 --> 01:01:46,229
How can you allow Kincaid's testimony?

952
01:01:46,896 --> 01:01:49,440
A hired killer given a sweetheart deal.

953
01:01:50,191 --> 01:01:52,777
A man like that will say
anything to save himself.

954
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,487
Kincaid has no sweetheart deal.

955
01:01:55,112 --> 01:01:56,739
His wife will go free, not him.

956
01:02:02,411 --> 01:02:03,830
The testimony will be allowed,

957
01:02:04,330 --> 01:02:06,916
assuming you produce
your witness by 5:00 p.m.

958
01:02:13,965 --> 01:02:16,443
- Michael, you should've been here by now.
- Yeah. Just a couple of bumps.

959
01:02:16,467 --> 01:02:17,301
We're on our way.

960
01:02:17,385 --> 01:02:18,946
<i>The judge isn't giving us any wiggle room.</i>

961
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,638
You have less than four hours now!

962
01:02:21,305 --> 01:02:22,905
<i>Well, we're gonna be there in half that.</i>

963
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:24,970
Then why are you calling me?

964
01:02:27,228 --> 01:02:28,312
Right. Well...

965
01:02:31,107 --> 01:02:33,484
I'm calling you because
I've been thinking, and...

966
01:02:37,947 --> 01:02:38,947
I forgive you.

967
01:02:42,660 --> 01:02:43,660
Yeah.

968
01:02:44,912 --> 01:02:45,997
It feels good to say that.

969
01:02:49,417 --> 01:02:50,418
I forgive you, Amelia.

970
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:53,796
Are you fucking kidding me?

971
01:02:54,171 --> 01:02:55,171
What?

972
01:02:55,381 --> 01:02:56,883
You're seriously doing this now?

973
01:02:57,133 --> 01:02:59,051
- No. What?
<i>- And forgive me for what?</i>

974
01:02:59,677 --> 01:03:02,322
- There's nothing to forgive!
- No, no, no, look, I thought that you...

975
01:03:02,346 --> 01:03:05,182
- Just get Kincaid here!
- Fucking prick!

976
01:03:16,736 --> 01:03:17,736
Darius?

977
01:03:28,497 --> 01:03:29,497
Fuck!

978
01:03:34,045 --> 01:03:36,047
Yeah. We've got the whole area covered.

979
01:03:36,589 --> 01:03:38,382
If Kincaid shows up, he's ours.

Couldn't you just had
the flowers delivered?

1002
01:06:14,205 --> 01:06:15,498
Needed a personal touch.

1003
01:06:15,706 --> 01:06:17,267
You were about to get
his personal touch,

1004
01:06:17,291 --> 01:06:18,209
if I hadn't followed you.

1005
01:06:18,292 --> 01:06:19,210
All right, I appreciate you.

1006
01:06:19,293 --> 01:06:21,313
And the guys who started
tracking you a few blocks ago.

1007
01:06:21,337 --> 01:06:23,089
You mean the guy you snatched in the bush,

1008
01:06:23,172 --> 01:06:24,932
and the two you left
knocked out in the park?

1009
01:06:25,424 --> 01:06:27,343
Like I said, I appreciate you.

1010
01:06:27,676 --> 01:06:30,012
Okay, so if you knew
that they were out there,

1011
01:06:30,096 --> 01:06:32,681
but you still felt it was important
to deliver these flowers?

1012
01:06:34,224 --> 01:06:36,059
Sonia's gonna really love those flowers.

1013
01:06:36,142 --> 01:06:37,811
I sure fucking hope so.

1014
01:06:37,894 --> 01:06:40,271
Now, this is as close
as I'm gonna be to her

1015
01:06:40,688 --> 01:06:41,731
for a very long time.

1016
01:06:43,024 --> 01:06:44,442
It had to be special.

1017
01:06:46,861 --> 01:06:47,861
First.

1018
01:06:49,114 --> 01:06:51,658
I'm first. Look... You were saying?

1019
01:06:52,534 --> 01:06:53,534
Tell me something.

1020
01:06:53,618 --> 01:06:55,245
The day you and Agent Roussel

1021
01:06:55,328 --> 01:06:56,996
took that picture I saw in your place,

1022
01:06:57,372 --> 01:06:59,972
what kind of things would you have done
for her to make her happy?

1023
01:07:00,917 --> 01:07:03,336
Anything. I loved her. Trusted her.

1024
01:07:04,337 --> 01:07:06,214
She sold me out. Case closed.

1025
01:07:06,464 --> 01:07:10,552
Well, that's cold. Maybe, just maybe,

1026
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:12,762
you ought to give her a pass on this.

1027
01:07:13,638 --> 01:07:15,473
I mean, I gotta tell you, honestly,

1028
01:07:16,349 --> 01:07:18,685
there's not a lot of women
who'd put up with your shit.

1029
01:07:19,686 --> 01:07:20,979
That's inspirational, thank you.

1030
01:07:21,062 --> 01:07:23,648
What I meant to say:
there's no women who would put up with it.

1031
01:07:24,023 --> 01:07:25,501
- That's better.
- You're an annoying motherfucker

1032
01:07:25,525 --> 01:07:26,685
with all your rules and shit.

1033
01:07:26,734 --> 01:07:29,904
I mean, if she can put up with that,
she must be a pretty special girl.

1034
01:07:32,615 --> 01:07:33,615
She is.

1035
01:07:35,368 --> 01:07:37,370
You know, I told her today
that I forgave her.

1036
01:07:37,704 --> 01:07:40,707
Really? And how'd that go?

1037
01:07:41,124 --> 01:07:42,124
Hard to tell.

1038
01:07:42,333 --> 01:07:44,627
You know, women don't like
to be forgiven for shit

1039
01:07:45,044 --> 01:07:47,255
'cause that implies they did
some shit to begin with.

1040
01:07:49,174 --> 01:07:50,800
I should just forget about Kurosawa.

1041
01:07:51,342 --> 01:07:53,261
- What?
- Takashi Kurosawa.

1042
01:07:54,762 --> 01:07:57,599
He was my client, she exposed him,
and he got killed.

1043
01:08:02,854 --> 01:08:03,854
Something funny?

1044
01:08:05,690 --> 01:08:08,151
She didn't expose your client!

1045
01:08:08,234 --> 01:08:09,819
I popped Kurosawa!

1046
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,489
<i>I was at the airport for another target.</i>

1047
01:08:13,573 --> 01:08:14,949
<i>I spotted him by accident.</i>

1048
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:17,493
<i>Lucky for me. Him, not so much.</i>

1049
01:08:18,244 --> 01:08:20,455

1052
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:36,429

I was the one who popped him.

1053
01:08:45,396 --> 01:08:46,396
I...

1054
01:08:48,524 --> 01:08:51,736
- Shit! What the fuck, Bryce! Mother...
- We're done!

1055
01:08:51,819 --> 01:08:53,404
That shit was two years ago, man.

1056
01:08:53,488 --> 01:08:54,968
You gonna be a little bitch about it?

as a condom in a convent.

1062
01:09:06,626 --> 01:09:09,170

you know what he'd say?

01:14:14,976 --> 01:14:15,976
Fuck!

1109
01:14:17,311 --> 01:14:18,896
Hey, Interpol! Interpol!

1110
01:14:25,653 --> 01:14:26,653
Fuck!

1111
01:14:34,495 --> 01:14:35,495
Shit!

1112
01:15:05,568 --> 01:15:06,652
Hurry!

1113
01:15:39,769 --> 01:15:40,936
Fuck!

1114
01:16:23,312 --> 01:16:24,312
Fuck!

1115
01:16:53,509 --> 01:16:54,552
Okay.

1116
01:17:03,477 --> 01:17:05,729
A loose helmet
is like wearing no helmet at all.

1117
01:17:06,730 --> 01:17:09,400
It's not a button strap. It's a D-ring.

1118
01:17:09,859 --> 01:17:12,486
Just unthread it through
the thing. It's very simple.

1119
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:16,031
Well... Or there's...
There's that shortcut.

1120
01:17:31,630 --> 01:17:34,717
I ask you one time, polite.

1121
01:17:35,426 --> 01:17:37,887
Where is Kincaid?

1122
01:17:40,764 --> 01:17:42,183
Honestly, I'd tell you if I knew.

1123
01:17:43,434 --> 01:17:45,769
You have my word. Look at my right hand.

1124
01:17:46,812 --> 01:17:49,023
See that? That's a Boy Scout salute.

1125
01:17:49,982 --> 01:17:50,983
We're sworn to never lie.

1126
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:52,693
I've taken an oath, so you can trust...

1127
01:17:53,486 --> 01:17:56,363
Right in the fucking ear!

1128
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,784
Really? Waterboarding? Really?

1129
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:03,829
I was in the CIA. You know,
we don't do that anymore.

1130
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:08,542
Okay. Hey, hey. Hold it.
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait, wait.

1131
01:18:08,792 --> 01:18:11,045
Here's what we learned.
The key to interrogation

1132
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:12,505
is establishing a bond

1133
01:18:12,922 --> 01:18:15,341
between the interrogator
and the subject, okay?

1134
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:18,010
You know, just sort of
like a rapport, okay?

1135
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:21,931
You need me to like you.
You need me to like you, okay?

1136
01:18:22,014 --> 01:18:23,641
You need me to like you!

1137
01:18:34,068 --> 01:18:35,319
I really don't like you.

1138
01:18:37,029 --> 01:18:38,489
Okay, okay, okay.

1139
01:18:47,498 --> 01:18:49,124
Where is Kincaid?

1140
01:18:49,625 --> 01:18:51,794
He's right behind you.
Scout's honor.

'cause I know you're gonna
start fucking talking,

cost you your girl and that...

fake-ass, made-up Triple-A shit

1157

- No, no, no...

1158
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:37,524
No, it was all my fault.

1159
01:20:38,901 --> 01:20:42,529
No... I did it all to myself.

1160
01:20:42,613 --> 01:20:44,823
Bryce, please! Come on,
you didn't do it to yourself.

1161
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,659
That's life. Life happens.

1162
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:48,452
Life without Amelia.

1163
01:20:50,788 --> 01:20:53,207
Hey, still time to work that shit out.

1164
01:20:55,793 --> 01:20:57,503
So, how'd you and Agent Roussel meet?

1165
01:21:01,256 --> 01:21:02,256
On a job.

1166
01:21:04,051 --> 01:21:05,051
She was...

1167
01:21:06,845 --> 01:21:08,722
She was working an undercover op,

1168
01:21:10,182 --> 01:21:11,182
very badly.

1169
01:21:13,018 --> 01:21:15,604
<i>I was at a client's funeral.
Massive heart attack.</i>

1170
01:21:16,230 --> 01:21:18,190

01:22:42,024 --> 01:22:43,424
See, that's what I'm talking about.

1192
01:22:43,817 --> 01:22:44,818
It just happened!

1193
01:22:45,486 --> 01:22:47,279
You didn't plan it, deduce it,

1194
01:22:47,362 --> 01:22:49,656
or google running

the same way I just bumped into Kurosawa.

1197
01:22:53,619 --> 01:22:55,204
You know, when life gives you shit,

you make Kool-Aid.

1199
01:23:00,542 --> 01:23:02,294
That's not really
how that expression works.

1200
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:05,380
Yeah, and that's the beauty

01:23:05,464 --> 01:23:07,716
Ah. Yeah, well, life, I mean...

1202
01:23:07,800 --> 01:23:11,178
Life doesn't usually give you shit,
and then turn into a beverage.

1203
01:23:11,553 --> 01:23:14,305
That's not... At least
where I'm from, that's not how it works.

1204
01:23:14,388 --> 01:23:15,949
Look, motherfucker,
you don't have to explain

1205
01:23:15,973 --> 01:23:18,494
- every goddamn thing that goes on in life!
- If it gives you lemons...

1206
01:23:18,518 --> 01:23:20,204
Okay? You don't need a reason
for that shit.

1207
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:21,062
...you would make lemonade.

1208

Told her what?

Hey... what if I told you
I couldn't protect you?

I'd say you're right.

1228
01:24:29,589 --> 01:24:32,258
We'll just go to Amsterdam,
I'll help you get Sonia out,

1229
01:24:33,676 --> 01:24:35,316
and you give her those flowers in person.

Dukhovich, that motherfucker's gotta go.

1234
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:48,027
Well, it's not gonna happen
unless we get there.

1235
01:24:48,441 --> 01:24:49,441
Shit, I'd bet on them.

1236
01:24:49,901 --> 01:24:50,985
Normally I would, too.

1237
01:24:51,068 --> 01:24:52,194

1238
01:24:52,278 --> 01:24:53,878
There's a couple of ringers in the game.

That's a good-looking Jag.

1241
01:25:02,163 --> 01:25:04,457
Yeah. I guarantee
you if that smells like ass,

1242
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:05,875
it's supermodel ass.

1243
01:25:12,214 --> 01:25:14,133
- Really?
- Oh yeah.

1244
01:25:14,592 --> 01:25:15,592
She blends right in.

1245
01:25:36,155 --> 01:25:37,406

on the right-hand side here,

1249

It's practically impossible...

1250
01:25:48,334 --> 01:25:49,794
Get out of the fucking car.

1251
01:25:49,877 --> 01:25:51,688
A three-day adjustment period
to figure this out.

1252

- The clutch...

1253
01:25:54,256 --> 01:25:55,536
if you don't give up that wheel.

1254
01:25:55,591 --> 01:25:56,717
Have you ever said please

1255
01:25:56,801 --> 01:25:57,861
- or thank you...
- Please, motherfucker!

1256
01:25:57,885 --> 01:25:59,178
Why are we always yelling?

1257
01:25:59,261 --> 01:26:00,701
- Get out of the fucking car!
- Fine!

1258
01:26:04,934 --> 01:26:06,185
Time's just about up.

1259
01:26:08,270 --> 01:26:11,148
No sign. They vanished in Amsterdam.

1260
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:12,441
Dukhovich is free.

01:26:29,000 --> 01:26:30,084
Hello?

1264
01:26:30,167 --> 01:26:31,210
<i>Hey.</i>

1265
01:26:31,293 --> 01:26:32,211
Michael, where are you?

1266
01:26:32,294 --> 01:26:33,587
We're a couple minutes out.

1267
01:26:37,091 --> 01:26:38,091
Look...

1268
01:26:38,926 --> 01:26:40,219
I wanna tell you that I'm sorry.

1269
01:26:42,430 --> 01:26:45,266
I wanna say that I'm sorry
for, um, for everything.

1270
01:26:45,349 --> 01:26:47,977
For Kurosawa, us, it's all my fault.

1271
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:49,478
You know, I act like a...

1272
01:26:50,438 --> 01:26:52,356
I act like a fucking child around you.

1273
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,835
<i>I can't admit that it's my fault,
and I project that onto you,</i>

1274
01:26:54,859 --> 01:26:56,360
<i>and, you know, that's not fair.</i>

1275
01:26:56,777 --> 01:26:57,945
You deserve better than that.

1276
01:27:02,658 --> 01:27:04,118
Why are you telling me this now?

1277
01:27:04,201 --> 01:27:07,163
Well, under the circumstances,
it seemed like a good time.

1278
01:27:07,246 --> 01:27:08,414
We got company.

1279
01:27:08,497 --> 01:27:09,498
Huh?

1280
01:27:17,631 --> 01:27:18,631
Let's go!

1281
01:27:28,100 --> 01:27:29,101
Amelia.

1282
01:27:33,898 --> 01:27:34,898
Amelia.

1283
01:27:38,402 --> 01:27:39,695
Just want to say that...

1284
01:27:39,779 --> 01:27:43,616
I... love... you.

1285
01:27:54,001 --> 01:27:56,504
Jesus Christ! Really?

1286
01:27:56,587 --> 01:27:58,047
What happened to the seatbelt rule?

1287
01:28:07,681 --> 01:28:08,681
Fuck!

01:28:48,389 --> 01:28:49,389
He had to bounce.

Follow me.

1362
01:35:55,857 --> 01:35:57,150
Obviously, Your Honor,

1363
01:35:57,234 --> 01:36:00,904
this has devolved into a complete waste
of my client's time.

1364
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,240
The prosecution has no witness to present.

1365
01:36:06,285 --> 01:36:07,845
Can you empty
your pockets, please, sir.

1366
01:36:14,376 --> 01:36:15,961
Are you kidding me? Come on!

1367

As we seem to be reaching our deadline,

1368
01:36:22,092 --> 01:36:26,680
I have no choice but to declare
that this trial has come to its natural...

1369
01:36:36,023 --> 01:36:39,151
Your Honor, I present Darius Kincaid.

1370
01:36:39,234 --> 01:36:40,736
The deadline has passed!

1371

a few seconds on the clock.

1372
01:36:45,782 --> 01:36:46,782
How do I look?

1373
01:36:46,992 --> 01:36:48,785
You got a little speck of blood on your...

1374
01:36:49,995 --> 01:36:50,995
everywhere.

1375
01:36:51,955 --> 01:36:54,374
Will the prosecution
please prepare their witness.

1376
01:36:54,458 --> 01:36:56,043
- Hi.
- My God, are you okay?

1377
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:58,962
Yeah. There's your guy.

1378
01:37:00,797 --> 01:37:02,507
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

1379
01:37:04,259 --> 01:37:05,379
By the way, bumping into you

1380
01:37:05,427 --> 01:37:07,107
is the best thing
that ever happened to me.

1381
01:37:14,019 --> 01:37:15,979
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

1382
01:37:16,063 --> 01:37:17,147
and nothing but the truth?

1383
01:37:17,981 --> 01:37:18,981
Yeah.

1384
01:37:21,026 --> 01:37:23,195
Your name is Darius Kincaid?

1385
01:37:23,779 --> 01:37:27,157
No. My real name is Darius Evans.

1386
01:37:28,075 --> 01:37:29,701
My parents separated when I was six.

1387
01:37:30,035 --> 01:37:32,537
My mother remarried
a real mean piece of work

1388
01:37:33,038 --> 01:37:34,706
named Roger Kincaid.

1389
01:37:35,082 --> 01:37:36,750
She figured if I took his name,

1390
01:37:37,292 --> 01:37:38,794
he'd keep his belt on more often.

1391
01:37:39,169 --> 01:37:41,046
Plan didn't work so well,
but the name stuck.

1392
01:37:41,755 --> 01:37:45,133
My real father's name
is Maurice Evans, preacher.

1393
01:37:45,634 --> 01:37:47,761
He was killed a few years later
in his own church.

1394
01:37:48,679 --> 01:37:49,596
I'm sorry, I didn't...

1395
01:37:49,680 --> 01:37:51,848
That's all right.
Can't research everything.

1396
01:37:52,182 --> 01:37:56,561
Mr. Kincaid, were you ever
in the employ of Vladislav Dukhovich?

1397
01:37:58,313 --> 01:38:00,399
No.
Have you ever met Dukhovich?

1398
01:38:01,191 --> 01:38:05,278
Yes. April 17, 2012,
he invited me to his palace.

1399
01:38:06,947 --> 01:38:10,200
<i>Prosecution Exhibit
17-D, palace security logs.</i>

1400
01:38:11,326 --> 01:38:13,704
<i>Did he offer you employment then?</i>

1401
01:38:14,454 --> 01:38:15,454
<i>Yes, he did.</i>

1402
01:38:16,832 --> 01:38:20,544
<i>He wanted me to take out
a political rival exiled in the UK.</i>

1403
01:38:22,879 --> 01:38:24,339
<i>- I refused.
- Why?</i>

1404
01:38:24,923 --> 01:38:26,758
<i>Because while I was
there, he ordered his men</i>

1405
01:38:26,842 --> 01:38:28,969
<i>to slaughter a village outside Polotsk.</i>

1406
01:38:32,055 --> 01:38:33,807
I'm not down with killing innocent people.

1407
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,017
And do you have evidence
to corroborate this?

1408
01:38:36,601 --> 01:38:37,601
Yeah.

1409
01:38:39,271 --> 01:38:42,190
Go to FTP site Raven 257.

1410

1415
01:38:52,868 --> 01:38:54,911
"Dukhovich is a dick," all caps,

1416
01:38:55,454 --> 01:38:57,080
except "dick" is lower case.

1417

Interpol with this shit.

1418

Order!

1420
01:39:25,484 --> 01:39:26,484
Order in the court!

1421
01:39:27,861 --> 01:39:28,861
Your Honors,

1422
01:39:30,071 --> 01:39:34,409
I could save us all some time.
May I address the court?

1423
01:39:38,079 --> 01:39:41,166
For months, I have been
sitting in this chair,

1424
01:39:41,249 --> 01:39:46,129
nodding along to this ludicrous charade.

1425
01:39:46,213 --> 01:39:47,213
Excuse me.

1426
01:39:47,589 --> 01:39:49,049
My excellent attorney was hoping

1427
01:39:49,132 --> 01:39:51,217
for the legitimacy of a formal acquittal,

1428
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:53,302
but that is no longer possible.

1429
01:39:53,385 --> 01:39:54,512
Thank you, Darius.

1430
01:39:55,846 --> 01:39:58,682
So, let us now end the charade.

1431
01:39:59,350 --> 01:40:01,352
The charges against me

1432
01:40:02,686 --> 01:40:04,188
are entirely correct.

1433
01:40:05,898 --> 01:40:09,401
I am the rightful ruler of Belarus!

1434
01:40:10,027 --> 01:40:12,905
- Sit down! Order!
- As the ruler of my nation,

1435
01:40:12,988 --> 01:40:16,408
I will do as I wish without exception,
without apology.

1436
01:40:16,492 --> 01:40:18,869
- Sit down! Order!
- I recognize no authority

1437
01:40:18,953 --> 01:40:21,113
- that limits my power!
- Mr. Dukhovich, I order you...

1438
01:40:24,250 --> 01:40:25,292
Assistant Director.

1439
01:40:25,376 --> 01:40:26,669
Go do your job, Amelia!

1440
01:40:28,587 --> 01:40:30,464
In this trial...

1441
01:40:30,548 --> 01:40:34,301
the world community
is attempting to make a statement!

1442
01:40:34,385 --> 01:40:37,680
Well, now I would like to make
a statement of my own!

1443
01:40:43,018 --> 01:40:44,019
Show me your phone.

1444
01:40:47,940 --> 01:40:51,735
I recognize no authority
that limits my powers!

1445
01:41:03,956 --> 01:41:05,499
Everybody go!

1446
01:41:11,505 --> 01:41:15,551
I will now take my leave
with my dignity intact!

1447
01:41:41,201 --> 01:41:44,663
Now, that's what
I call Triple-A service.

1448
01:41:45,623 --> 01:41:46,623
Fuck!

1449
01:41:48,125 --> 01:41:51,420
Fuck! Medic! Medic!
I need a medic over here!

1450
01:41:52,338 --> 01:41:54,131
- Lockdown protocol!
- Don't move!

1451
01:42:05,976 --> 01:42:09,521
<i>We're here live in front

1452
01:42:09,855 --> 01:42:13,817

1453
01:42:14,526 --> 01:42:16,820

It's a critical health situation!</i>

Focus on me, Bryce.

1456
01:42:23,786 --> 01:42:25,245
Bryce! Focus on me.

1457
01:42:25,329 --> 01:42:27,206
I'd really rather not.

1458
01:42:27,581 --> 01:42:32,419
...<i>in effect.
All units. All units.</i>

1459
01:42:33,295 --> 01:42:36,173
Stay with me, Bryce. Stay with me.

1460
01:42:36,590 --> 01:42:38,717
I did my job. You go do yours.

1461
01:42:39,510 --> 01:42:41,345
Gotta go get that motherfucker!

1462
01:42:45,516 --> 01:42:46,684
Freeze! On your knees.

1463

1465
01:43:02,741 --> 01:43:04,618
Officer, the building is in lockdown.

1466
01:43:05,119 --> 01:43:06,495
Dukhovich does not leave his cell.

1467
01:43:12,626 --> 01:43:13,626
Let's go!

1468
01:43:31,645 --> 01:43:33,188
It's over, Assistant Director.

1469
01:43:33,272 --> 01:43:34,690
Give up.

1470
01:44:15,647 --> 01:44:19,193
I didn't want to do this, Amelia.
I swear to you.

1471
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:49,639
Fuck!

1472
01:44:58,190 --> 01:45:01,360
Michael! Michael!

1473
01:45:04,071 --> 01:45:06,990
- Michael, you hear me?
- Are you okay? Yeah?

1474
01:45:07,074 --> 01:45:08,867
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Good, good, good.

1475
01:45:08,951 --> 01:45:09,952
- You?
- Yeah.

1476

Oh, no. You're bleeding.

1477
01:45:12,621 --> 01:45:14,998
Oh, no, no, no.

1478
01:45:19,503 --> 01:45:20,503
I'll get some help.

1479
01:45:22,339 --> 01:45:23,339
Stay here.

1480
01:45:33,976 --> 01:45:34,976
Hey!

1481
01:45:35,269 --> 01:45:36,395
Hey!

1482
01:46:07,467 --> 01:46:09,011
Up on the ledge, Dookie man.

1483
01:46:12,556 --> 01:46:15,267
You heard me, bitch! Up on the ledge!

1484
01:46:31,617 --> 01:46:33,452
The look on your face.

1485
01:46:35,746 --> 01:46:37,331
You're so proud.

1486
01:46:38,040 --> 01:46:40,042
Darius Kincaid,

1487
01:46:40,959 --> 01:46:43,670
about to be a hero, save the day.

1488
01:46:44,671 --> 01:46:46,173
None of that matters.

1489
01:46:47,174 --> 01:46:48,383
There is no redemption,

1490
01:46:48,842 --> 01:46:51,887
no atonement for a man like you.

1491
01:46:51,970 --> 01:46:56,600
Your whole life has been
but a trail of corpses,

1492
01:46:57,935 --> 01:47:01,063
and I will be just another
dead body on the pile!

1493
01:47:03,482 --> 01:47:04,482
Go ahead!

1494
01:47:06,068 --> 01:47:07,068
Finish me!

1495
01:47:09,029 --> 01:47:13,450
But don't think for a moment
it will change what you are.

1496
01:47:20,958 --> 01:47:23,043
I don't give a fuck about all of that!

1497
01:47:23,961 --> 01:47:24,961
You fucked up

1498
01:47:25,921 --> 01:47:29,132
when you shot my bodyguard.

1499
01:47:30,634 --> 01:47:31,634
Who?

1500
01:47:45,399 --> 01:47:46,483
Dukhovich.

1501
01:47:48,485 --> 01:47:49,485
That's Dukhovich.

1502
01:48:14,553 --> 01:48:16,722
Okay, here's what I'm thinking.

1503
01:48:17,723 --> 01:48:18,765
Celebrity security.

1504
01:48:19,433 --> 01:48:20,433
It's low stress.

1505
01:48:20,976 --> 01:48:22,936
Boy bands and shit, right?

1506
01:48:23,020 --> 01:48:25,660
One of those guys gets killed,
nobody's getting all that mad at me.

1507
01:48:27,190 --> 01:48:28,734
Well, we'll figure it out.

1508
01:48:28,817 --> 01:48:29,817
We will?

1509
01:48:31,278 --> 01:48:34,865
Yo! What a brother gotta do
to get arrested up in this bitch?

1510
01:48:37,409 --> 01:48:40,829
Can't someone just Taser him?
I mean, like, a non-lethal Taser.

1511
01:48:41,204 --> 01:48:44,833
Director Casoria. My deal still good?

1512
01:48:45,417 --> 01:48:47,919
You definitely held up
your end, Mr. Kincaid.

1513
01:48:48,587 --> 01:48:52,841
Agent Roussel, why don't you go find
Mr. Kincaid some handcuffs.

1514
01:48:54,051 --> 01:48:55,052
With pleasure.

1515
01:48:59,431 --> 01:49:01,683
You were right to trust your instincts.
Well done.

1516
01:49:02,768 --> 01:49:03,768
Thank you, ma'am.

1517
01:49:06,396 --> 01:49:07,939
- You're welcome.
- For what?

1518
01:49:08,482 --> 01:49:10,609
I got you a front row seat
to the Roussel show,

1519
01:49:10,692 --> 01:49:13,070
and I got you that all-access
backstage pass

1520
01:49:13,153 --> 01:49:15,405
- to that ass you've been wanting so bad.
- You did what?

1521
01:49:15,781 --> 01:49:18,116
You jumped out of the car,
I gave her the 411 on you.

1522
01:49:18,200 --> 01:49:21,119
I didn't jump out of the...
I went through the fucking windshield.

1523
01:49:21,203 --> 01:49:22,037
Semantics.

1524
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:23,038
Semantics?

1525
01:49:23,121 --> 01:49:25,475
Semantics. Yeah, just another way
of saying the same thing...

1526
01:49:25,499 --> 01:49:27,042
I know what semantics means.

1527
01:49:27,125 --> 01:49:29,103
I also know that I don't need
love advice from you.

1528
01:49:29,127 --> 01:49:31,046
Oh, really? So tell me
how that love life shit

1529
01:49:31,129 --> 01:49:32,289
was going before I showed up.

1530
01:49:37,302 --> 01:49:39,302
You know, she's gonna be
right back, and that's it.

1531
01:49:40,263 --> 01:49:41,306
Last chance to run.

1532
01:49:41,807 --> 01:49:43,892
I'm going along with
the program till Sonia's free.

1533
01:49:44,726 --> 01:49:45,769
Then I do my thing.

1534
01:49:46,895 --> 01:49:49,439
You really think
it's gonna be that easy, do you?

1535
01:49:49,523 --> 01:49:50,440
Motherfucker, please.

1536
01:49:50,524 --> 01:49:52,567
You know when I want
some shit to pop, it pops.

1537
01:49:52,818 --> 01:49:54,861
Like that shot
through that tittie-small window

1538
01:49:54,945 --> 01:49:56,089
- on Kurosawa's plane.
- That's enough.

1539
01:49:56,113 --> 01:49:58,615
- Okay, that's enough out of you.
- Show me the face you made

1540
01:49:58,698 --> 01:50:00,385
- when that shit went down.
- That still stings.

1541
01:50:00,409 --> 01:50:02,261
I know you wasn't
expecting that shit to happen.

1542
01:50:02,285 --> 01:50:03,620
Yeah, I was expecting you

1543
01:50:03,703 --> 01:50:05,455
to blow my client's head off.

1544
