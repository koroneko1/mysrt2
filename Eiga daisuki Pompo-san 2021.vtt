WEBVTT

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.240
I've always been good
at becoming other people.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:38.240
Yes, it's always been my dream.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.250
Well--

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.110
If you find you can't
live In the shadows,

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.490
then you should come with me

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.030
into the spotlight.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.540
Actors, designers,
performers, filmers,

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.080
the best stage, come on!

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.130
No ticket needed for
the entrance of dreams!

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.960
Legendary theaters
and poolside celebrities!

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.470
Pushing through rivals and paparazzi

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.550
until your name's on the Walk of Fame!

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.310
A large-sized dream!

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.470
But you should beware.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.390
If your restless feet
should trip and fall,

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:50.480
there's no way back.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.820
You know,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:59.620
what look like diamonds from
afar are actually someone's tears.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:06.830
But if your dream is still alive,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:10.330
dance on fire!

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.340
Make the floor red hot!

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.670
Dance on fire!

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.510
Just keep on dancing!

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.680
If you're burned out but
your dream still isn't,

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.350
then you're sure to smile!

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.360
Ready?

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.650
Pompo: The Cinéphile

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.190
Great!

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.690
Cut!

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.700
OK!

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.070
Alright!

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.100
That's it for the front shots.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.370
Prepare the scaff!

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.710
That was great, Mystia!

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.880
Thanks, Gene.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.550
It's more dramatic from the side.

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.380
OK, I'll move the camera.

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.380
Thanks!

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.220
Gene, what are you writing?

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.940
There are so many
things to learn on a film set,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.400
so I'm taking notes on everything.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:17.230
Wow! You're so keen on studying!

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.070
No, I--

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.820
Pompo is here!

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.410
How's it going?

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.780
- Great! 
- Good morning!

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.080
Hi, Pompo!

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.460
You're looking sexy today, Mystia.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.080
Director, how's it going?

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.250
Take a look.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.720
That's great!

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.220
Just the right amount of sex appeal.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.760
Right? Have you
prepared for the meeting?

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.600
As Pompo's assistant,
for about a year...

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.270
I've been watching from the sidelines.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.940
Gene, go buy me some food.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.520
Yes, ma'am!

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.780
- A tuna sandwich. 
- Yes, ma'am!

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.780
For some reason, she only
produces uncomplicated B-movies.

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.300
Erm--

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.970
You only like B-movies?

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.470
No, I like all movies.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.850
- I'm not picky.
 - Oh.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.480
But this is a summer
movie. The sea, swimsuits.

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.280
I wanna show everyone
Mystia's beautiful body.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.490
As long as the lead actress
looks attractive, it's a good movie.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:48.330
Really?

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.830
With a good lead, I can
make any movie into a hit.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.750
Making a tearjerker moving is easy,

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.670
Making a silly one
moving takes genius.

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.970
I guess you're right.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.270
What do we have tomorrow?

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.360
The audition for the next
project directed by Corbett.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.360
Ooh! Deciding the
fate of young people!

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.740
Gene, don't be late, OK?

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.030
Good night.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.150
A great picture.

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.150
Peterzen! Peterzen Film!

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.920
You're late!

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.090
What did I tell you?

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:23.670
The audition's over!

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:25.590
I'm sorry!

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.930
Go buy me something
sweet. With chocolate!

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.260
Yes, ma'am! I'm on my way!

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.430
Was she the last one?

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.440
Yes, but she can't even act.

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.110
I'll be in the screening room.

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:16.140
Time for a seafood barbecue!

00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:20.640
Amazing! Such a trashy
story, but a great movie!

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:24.520
Pompo can take anything
and make it into a hit.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:27.150
She really is a genius.

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.830
That angle was brilliant.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.250
Yeah, that bit was fantastic.

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:42.830
Grandpa!

00:07:44.170 --> 00:07:46.300
- You came! 
- Yeah.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:50.630
The screen filled with cute
asses. Very entertaining.

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.180
Right? Right?

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:56.430
It's a giant of film, legendary
producer J. D. Peterzen!

00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:00.850
I've watched so many of his movies.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.810
After he retired,

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:08.190
young cineaste Pompo
inherited all of his connections.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.820
But that's not all she inherited.

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:15.200
His eye for scripts,
actors, directors.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.990
His charisma and decisiveness.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.290
All the talents needed to make
movies. A silver screen prodigy!

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:28.750
Pompo, he's gonna take some PR photos.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:30.210
Alright!

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.380
See you!

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.390
Mr. Peterzen.

00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.730
You're Stan "The Unsinkable
Battleship" Hansen, aren't you?

00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:42.890
I'm Gene.

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:47.230
Is there a secret to
making a great movie?

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.070
There's no correct
way to make a movie.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.570
I guess not.

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:58.080
However, a film set is a living thing.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:00.910
The actors' mood,
the changing scenery,

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.040
You need sharp visual senses...

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.250
so you never miss a
moment that sparkles.

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.760
Sharp visual senses?

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.930
I guess you're asking because
you wanna make a movie?

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.600
Not in my wildest dreams!

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.060
I could never--

00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:25.440
Get a grip, son.

00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.440
There's a reason Pompo chose you.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:30.730
She chose me?

00:09:31.570 --> 00:09:35.950
A producer's job is basically
all about spotting talent.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.450
Pompo keeps you around...

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.450
because she sees something in you.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:47.120
In me? Really?

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:51.630
I think you're right.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.130
Director, a word.

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.970
And so, I've decided to have
you make the trailer for Marine!

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.720
Whaaat!?

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:08.810
But the producer usually
has a specialist studio do that!

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.980
Someone who aspires to be a creator
shouldn't use words like "usually"!

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:26.120
I need a 15-second spot. You
can use editing software, right?

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:28.500
Well, yes, but--

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.500
Grab attention, put in a twist,

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:36.630
show the best parts and
mislead them to create interest.

00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.010
And finally an explosion!

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:40.180
Like that.

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.010
All that in just 15 seconds?

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:47.520
By the way, the 15-second
spot is the one most people see,

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.940
so it directly affects revenue.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:54.860
The livelihoods of the
entire crew are in your hands.

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.870
It's realistically
impossible to fit all that...

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.700
into 15 seconds.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.710
It's too short,

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:13.130
so I'll supplement it with
things outside the film!

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.400
One technique of filmmaking...

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:35.730
is to make them imagine the
next scene without showing it.

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.410
I'll make the audience...

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:50.750
fill in the gaps in their heads.

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:56.590
Who cares about revenue
or the crew's livelihoods?

00:11:57.250 --> 00:11:58.590
It's so much fun!

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.780
It was supposed to
be just another holiday.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.960
What do you think?

00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:41.630
Director?

00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:48.810
This is Pompo, isn't it?

00:12:48.970 --> 00:12:50.140
Yes, it is.

00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:54.370
Oh, when I called out to
Mystia after we wrapped.

00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:55.650
Why a backstage shot?

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.810
Well, I...

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:01.990
wanted a misleading
shot to create interest.

00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:04.150
I found it by chance.

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:06.820
Is it no good?

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.000
It's great.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.330
It's fantastic!

00:13:18.420 --> 00:13:22.630
So Gene can make the
30-second, and net versions, right?

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.670
That's fine.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.340
Thank you so much!

00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:38.810
- Yesterday 
- Huh?

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.190
You talked with my
grandpa. That's rare for you.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:46.570
He said something I
wanted to ask you about.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.370
Why did you choose
me to be your assistant?

00:13:52.870 --> 00:13:56.500
Here there are so many
people better educated,

00:13:56.620 --> 00:13:58.880
and better at their jobs than me.

00:13:59.330 --> 00:14:01.170
So why me?

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:03.550
That's simple.

00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:06.720
You had one advantage
over all the rest.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:12.060
Your eyes didn't sparkle.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:19.730
All their eyes looked like they had
a brilliantly sparkling adolescence.

00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.860
But a fulfilling life makes
your way of thinking shallow.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.530
Happiness destroys creativity.

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.740
They aren't qualified to be creators.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:36.580
However, in your eyes, I saw...

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:40.250
the typical signs of an
outcast with nowhere to go.

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:42.250
I'm praising you.

00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:44.380
Thank you.

00:14:45.010 --> 00:14:49.930
People who run from reality
create their own world in their mind.

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.640
The expanse and depth
of an outcast's inner world...

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.850
equals their untapped
creative potential!

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:02.440
That's why I believe in
a social misfit like you.

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:06.240
In your eyes.

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:07.610
Oh.

00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:10.950
Eyes, eyes, it's happening again.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.620
Like the other day?

00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:16.120
I feel I've forgotten something.

00:15:16.290 --> 00:15:17.910
About the screening?

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:20.960
The audition yesterday?

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:23.710
That's it! Now I remember!

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:25.960
A little lightbulb moment.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:29.130
I didn't notice at the time. This one!

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:31.130
- Bring this girl here. 
- Yes, ma'am.

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.430
This girl is--

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.430
She has the eyes of a misfit too?

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.690
An actress needs sparkling eyes!

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.980
I don't know exactly what it is,

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.070
but she has something.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:49.990
In any case, when it
comes to filmmaking,

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:53.320
you just have to rely
on your instincts, right?

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:03.170
May I use the screening room?

00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:06.000
Sure. What will you watch?

00:16:06.130 --> 00:16:08.630
Cinema Paradiso.

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:11.180
I hate that movie.

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:13.180
But it's a masterpiece.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.930
It's a good story,
but it's way too long.

00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.180
You don't like long movies?

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:19.850
No, I hate them.

00:16:20.020 --> 00:16:23.690
The longer they are, the
longer you can enjoy them.

00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.690
No, you're wrong. Let me tell you.

00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:32.530
My parents were always really busy,

00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:34.700
so my grandpa raised me.

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.910
But movies are all he knows,

00:16:38.290 --> 00:16:40.660
so he made me watch them.

00:16:41.210 --> 00:16:45.380
It's tough for a little kid to
sit still for two to three hours.

00:16:46.210 --> 00:16:49.380
He made me watch until the end,

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.550
and then tell him my impressions.

00:16:52.010 --> 00:16:55.220
So a simple story
90 minutes or under...

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.890
was like an oasis in the desert.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:04.900
That's one reason
why I hate long movies.

00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.060
And why else?

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.690
Making them concentrate
for two hours or more...

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.070
is unkind to the modern audience.

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.410
Filmmakers should choose wisely,

00:17:15.570 --> 00:17:19.280
and express their vision
as concisely as possible.

00:17:19.910 --> 00:17:23.290
A bloated film isn't beautiful, is it?

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:29.920
But I love watching movies,
so even three or four hours--

00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:32.590
That's what's wrong with film geeks?

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:38.430
Being able to talk to a movie genius
about films from such a young age.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:41.220
How I envy her.

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.600
Excuse me.

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.440
Pompo, you came to watch it?

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.900
Halfway through?

00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.940
I don't wanna watch the whole thing.

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.950
I came to get a taste
of a masterpiece.

00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:13.130
Huh?

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:17.130
I have a sense of déjà vu.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:21.810
What is it?

00:18:24.310 --> 00:18:25.480
Good morning.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.390
Huh?

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.610
She isn't here yet.

00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:42.780
Meister? This is what
Pompo's been writing?

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.190
Pompo is back!

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:13.980
I shouldn't have eaten
so much. I'm stuffed!

00:19:14.110 --> 00:19:15.030
I see.

00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:17.030
- How's the script? 
- Well--

00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:19.150
Yes, yes, I know.

00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.160
Pompo could never
write a boring script.

00:19:22.280 --> 00:19:24.620
Give me your impression in detail.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:27.620
Alright, I will.

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.840
An aged artist finds peace
encountering nature and a young girl.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:36.460
It's a hackneyed
cliché of a story, but...

00:19:37.050 --> 00:19:39.510
the characters are so fascinating.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:44.220
Dalbert, the arrogant but naive
extremely talented musician.

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:49.230
Lily, at times like an inquisitive
boy, at others like a sensitive girl.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:51.900
Just two main characters.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:53.980
But they can carry the story.

00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:57.230
How can a B-movie producer like you...

00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:00.240
write such a script? It's incredible!

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.070
I see, I see.

00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.580
So you think I'm a B-movie producer!?

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:06.910
Forgive me!

00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:09.540
And the visuals, too.

00:20:09.910 --> 00:20:14.540
The switch from the bustle of
the city to the grandeur of the Alps.

00:20:15.090 --> 00:20:16.380
It's so liberating.

00:20:17.090 --> 00:20:20.720
If I saw that on the big
screen, I'd be dazzled.

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.600
By the way, Gene.

00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:31.440
Which scene did you like best?

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.770
The one where Lily is singing
and looks over her shoulder.

00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.110
That was a quick answer.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:42.950
It's when Dalbert regains
his passion for music,

00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.280
and because I pictured
the scene when I read it.

00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:49.950
You've passed.

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:54.960
But most of the scenes
only have two characters,

00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:57.790
so you'd need very good actors.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:20:59.590
It's already been cast.

00:20:59.710 --> 00:21:02.470
I've asked Martin
Braddock to play Dalbert.

00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.800
Martin Braddock!?

00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:09.970
He's a legend! The
best actor in the world.

00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.140
But didn't he retire?

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:17.650
He just found work tiresome,
and has been resting for 10 years.

00:21:17.810 --> 00:21:20.320
I got my grandpa to persuade him.

00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.820
Wow!

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:25.490
Martin Braddock's
first film in 10 years.

00:21:25.950 --> 00:21:27.490
Great publicity, right?

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.160
It's bound to be a smash hit!

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:32.160
And Lily will be played by--

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.040
Erm, excuse me?

00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:35.620
Right on cue.

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.050
I had my hair cut, just like you said.

00:21:40.460 --> 00:21:43.670
It really suits you, Natalie.

00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:51.680
It's Lily! This person is Lily!

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.850
Right?

00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:56.190
I wrote this script for her.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:58.020
That's why--

00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.030
The first time I saw her,
I caught a glimpse of it.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:06.030
A very beautiful scene full of light.

00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:11.370
I wrote the script to recapture
that brief moment of light.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:16.170
Scripts are sometimes
written for actors?

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:21.210
Occasionally, a whole story unfolds
in your mind when you see someone,

00:22:21.550 --> 00:22:25.050
which means it's bound to
become a fantastic movie.

00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:26.680
I see.

00:22:27.130 --> 00:22:28.550
Erm, what were...

00:22:28.890 --> 00:22:31.390
you two talking about just now?

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:33.390
I'll tell you.

00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.890
You've got your first lead role.

00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:42.230
So suddenly!? I-- I--

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:43.980
Here you go.

00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:48.070
You're gonna shoot this movie, OK?

00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.450
Director Gene.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.420
Road repairs. Please
take a different route.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:06.760
Alright.

00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:10.720
Thank you. Sorry
for the inconvenience.

00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:16.020
Excuse me--

00:23:19.690 --> 00:23:22.610
No, no! I have to take a shower...

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:25.940
and go to the audition.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:31.950
Oh no!

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:36.120
I'm late! I'm late!

00:23:50.970 --> 00:23:54.470
I'm number 15, Natalie Woodward.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.270
Too plain! Out!

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:08.320
My 30th rejection.

00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:11.990
No wonder I'm depressed.

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:22.500
You're late! The audition's over!

00:24:22.670 --> 00:24:23.830
I'm sorry!

00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:27.130
So expensive.

00:24:53.860 --> 00:24:55.870
My smile is my best asset!

00:24:56.030 --> 00:24:59.040
I'm never gonna give up!

00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.370
I can't abandon my dreams now.

00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:05.330
I came to this town to fulfill them!

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:10.710
Yes?

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.130
I'm here! Good evening!

00:25:14.470 --> 00:25:16.640
Sorry to rush you over here.

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.220
Natalie Woodward.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:22.560
Born in Sunroad. A
town famous for corn.

00:25:22.680 --> 00:25:24.560
No acting experience.

00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:26.560
Are you making a living?

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:28.570
I have a day job.

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:31.400
- How many days a week? 
- All seven.

00:25:31.570 --> 00:25:33.240
And acting lessons?

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.570
About once a fortnight.

00:25:35.910 --> 00:25:40.240
You'll never become a
movie star at that rate!

00:25:40.410 --> 00:25:42.580
You know Mystia?

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:46.250
Yes! I wish I were
as beautiful as she is.

00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.540
- Alright, quit your day job. 
- Huh?

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:51.260
Leave your apartment
and move in with Mystia.

00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:55.260
You'll be her apprentice,
with her all day, every day.

00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:57.180
I'll call and tell her.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.600
Do the same training as her.

00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:02.430
Learn from her performances on set.

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.560
- Understood?
 - Yes.

00:26:06.850 --> 00:26:08.940
If you get it, then go!

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:28.540
You must be Natalie.

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:30.790
- Nice to meet you.
 - Yes!

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.130
It's really her! She's so beautiful!

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:38.300
Such a huge place!

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:43.100
I'm going to the gym.
You're coming too, right?

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.220
Yes!

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:49.060
You have great abs!

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:52.940
I put on a bit more flesh
for the camera, though.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.490
Muscles turn boys off.

00:27:01.740 --> 00:27:05.410
It was my first time,
so my whole body hurts!

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:13.170
Leave the cooking to me.

00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:15.840
It's the least I can do in return.

00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:19.800
I'll make you healthy food
to keep you in top condition.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.360
I heard you've...

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:36.490
wanted to be an actress
ever since you were little.

00:27:36.610 --> 00:27:37.900
Yes, that's right.

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:40.610
I hope you get a role soon.

00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:42.030
Yes!

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:48.870
"Even the smallest star in
the sky shines like an angel."

00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.330
No, no! Don't just
read the script out loud.

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:54.210
I'm so sorry!

00:27:57.460 --> 00:27:59.050
Here you are.

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:01.510
Thank you!

00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.220
Pompo is here!

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.020
How's it going?

00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:08.560
Natalie, your face.

00:28:10.810 --> 00:28:13.190
What is this?

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:16.570
Good, she's almost ready.

00:28:54.770 --> 00:28:55.940
Yes?

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.280
Her hair?

00:28:58.440 --> 00:29:02.280
Alright, I'll tell her.

00:29:02.530 --> 00:29:05.280
Making a move at last, huh, Pompo?

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:11.160
Natalie, Pompo wants
you at the studio tomorrow.

00:29:11.290 --> 00:29:12.460
And--

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:16.710
I had my hair cut.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:24.300
Director Gene!

00:29:24.970 --> 00:29:26.470
Director!?

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.140
I'm a director.

00:29:28.310 --> 00:29:30.470
I can't believe this either!

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.140
I'm so excited, I think I might faint!

00:29:33.310 --> 00:29:35.480
I can't stop being nauseous.

00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:36.980
Hey!

00:29:37.150 --> 00:29:39.150
- Haargh! 
- Mystia!

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:42.650
You have no choice, so
you'd better be ready...

00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.360
to fulfill your dreams!

00:29:45.990 --> 00:29:48.830
Don't just stand
there. Meet and greet!

00:29:50.490 --> 00:29:52.290
Here I go!

00:29:55.830 --> 00:29:57.840
You too, Gene.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:10.350
You're Gene, the director, right?

00:30:11.850 --> 00:30:13.520
Martin!

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:16.520
Do your best.

00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.020
Yes!

00:30:18.190 --> 00:30:19.440
Thanks for doing this.

00:30:19.570 --> 00:30:21.150
Oh, hello.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:23.360
Right before my eyes.

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:28.200
Two legends who have won
six Nyacademy Awards together!

00:30:29.370 --> 00:30:31.370
Long time no see.

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.620
You're...

00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:36.170
Hawk and Animal of 
The Road Warriors, aren't you?

00:30:36.290 --> 00:30:37.710
I'm Gene, one person.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.380
So you are. Gene.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.210
Congratulations.

00:30:42.380 --> 00:30:44.880
Thank you.

00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:48.220
Martin gets lonely
surprisingly easily,

00:30:48.390 --> 00:30:50.550
so don't be too much in awe of him.

00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.390
Talk to him as much as you can.

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.890
Alright.

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.060
Gene, Gene.

00:30:57.850 --> 00:30:59.060
Director Corbett.

00:30:59.230 --> 00:31:01.400
Congratulations on your first gig.

00:31:01.570 --> 00:31:04.400
Congratulations on
the success of Marine.

00:31:04.570 --> 00:31:07.070
It's all thanks to the brilliant crew.

00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:11.450
May I give you some
advice as a senior colleague?

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:13.540
Yes, please do.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.750
It's your first film,
and Martin's in it,

00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:18.960
so you're bound to be tense.

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:23.460
If you try to please everyone,
it'll be a fuzzy mishmash.

00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:25.920
Make it a movie...

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:29.760
for the one person you
want to show it to most.

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:33.970
Then you'll have sharp focus.
A movie with a clear outline.

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:35.930
You're right.

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.440
I was worried about
making a mess of it.

00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.610
She's the female lead? Not you?

00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:46.780
I'm not in it.

00:31:46.900 --> 00:31:48.110
I'm the female lead.

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.110
Damn, I'm crestfallen.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:53.910
Anyway, I'm Martin Braddock.

00:31:54.030 --> 00:31:55.490
Best actor in the world.

00:31:55.870 --> 00:31:57.180
Wanna network socially?

00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:59.120
I don't have a smartphone.

00:32:02.630 --> 00:32:06.300
Martin was so disappointed.

00:32:06.460 --> 00:32:08.630
I guess I'm not good enough.

00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.300
Oh, Director.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.850
I get heartburn when I hear that.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:17.810
Director.

00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:18.850
Yes?

00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:22.810
Is it weird having me as the lead?

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.070
Maybe I'm not attractive.

00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:30.650
I'm full of nerves and
wanna run away too.

00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.160
But when I think about it,

00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:35.660
running from reality,

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:40.660
I have no other place to go but here.

00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:47.000
Only two choices:
Make a movie, or die.

00:32:48.510 --> 00:32:50.840
So I'll stake my life on this.

00:32:51.010 --> 00:32:52.680
I'm gonna direct it.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:58.850
Me too.

00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:01.690
Blue skies,

00:33:02.190 --> 00:33:04.520
cornfields as far as the eye can see.

00:33:05.480 --> 00:33:07.650
That's all there is in my hometown.

00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.570
So I fell in love with movies.

00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.870
Films gave me the chance to dream.

00:33:16.870 --> 00:33:19.120
I'm gonna be an actress!

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.710
You're pretty, so you'll be a
wonderful actress, Natalie.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.760
Since then, I've worked hard,

00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:36.220
saved some money, and
now I'm here in Nyallywood.

00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:39.770
So I have to make my break.

00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:43.060
You know--

00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:44.060
Yes?

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.230
It's something Pompo said.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:53.400
As long as the lead actress
looks attractive, it's a good movie.

00:33:53.530 --> 00:33:55.570
Huh? Oh.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:58.740
You've been chosen by Pompo,

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:03.160
which means you're
attractive as a lead actress.

00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:09.210
And also, I can't see
anyone else in the role of Lily.

00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.090
Don't worry. Let me shoot you.

00:34:22.770 --> 00:34:24.770
Alright. Thanks.

00:34:25.270 --> 00:34:27.770
You've given me confidence.

00:34:28.110 --> 00:34:30.150
Let's do it, Director Gene!

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:32.280
Erm, yes!

00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:43.120
Huh? You're still awake?

00:34:43.290 --> 00:34:46.960
I'm going over the
location arrangements.

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.960
Get plenty of rest, OK?

00:34:49.290 --> 00:34:52.250
That's also part of your job.

00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:59.970
Sorry, I need the restroom.

00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:01.930
Yet again, Alan?

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:05.810
This is a huge contract.
Don't mess it up!

00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:07.900
Of course.

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:10.150
That kid--

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:31.170
I know that guy from somewhere.

00:35:37.630 --> 00:35:40.340
Pompo is here in Switzerland!

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:43.600
This is great!

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:46.730
The despondent Dalbert
lands in Switzerland,

00:35:46.850 --> 00:35:49.940
and is moved to tears by
the splendor of the Alps.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:52.020
What a wonderful idea!

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:53.150
Right?

00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.860
No, it's no good.

00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:59.030
When he arrives here, his heart
is closed to the outside world.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.320
He doesn't see the scenery.

00:36:07.330 --> 00:36:10.710
Sorry! I have no right to
be giving you my opinion!

00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:13.710
No problem. You're the director.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.710
Yes.

00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:17.460
But movies are made by a team.

00:36:18.010 --> 00:36:21.550
I won't hesitate to
give you my opinion.

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.970
You decide whether to use it.

00:36:24.350 --> 00:36:25.470
Yes.

00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:28.890
Every one of us should
share our thoughts.

00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:30.060
Yes!

00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:34.230
Having a veteran on
board makes things so easy!

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:46.240
Grandma, look how far I've come!

00:36:46.410 --> 00:36:48.500
Mystia, I'll do my best.

00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:53.080
Scene 32, shot 1, take 1.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:56.130
In an Alpen meadow,
the heartbroken Dalbert--

00:36:56.250 --> 00:36:56.880
Get ready!

00:36:56.890 --> 00:36:58.670
meets Lily for the first time.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.630
OK.

00:37:03.430 --> 00:37:04.430
Speed.

00:37:04.930 --> 00:37:06.260
Action!

00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:15.610
This is the power of the
best actor in the world!

00:37:16.690 --> 00:37:18.570
He's usually so lively,

00:37:18.690 --> 00:37:22.280
but as soon as we began,
he embodied despondency.

00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:25.120
But more surprising...

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:31.410
was Lily's raw presence.

00:37:37.130 --> 00:37:39.630
I wrote this script for her.

00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:43.630
This is what a story written
for an actor looks like.

00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:50.310
Martin is...

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:55.600
going back to Nyallywood for
the orchestra scene after this?

00:37:55.730 --> 00:37:56.940
That's right.

00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:59.730
Don't you have to
practice being a conductor?

00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:00.780
Well--

00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:04.320
Martin has played a conductor
twice in previous films.

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:06.490
In the climax scene of Welter,

00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:09.390
the genius conductor he
plays conducts an orchestra...

00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:13.000
in a single take of 6
minutes 40 seconds.

00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:15.170
It made cinematic history.

00:38:15.330 --> 00:38:19.000
Even pro musicians say
his performance was perfect,

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:23.170
so I'm sure he'll remember
how with a little coaching.

00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:27.850
Is something wrong?

00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:30.310
What can I say?

00:38:30.430 --> 00:38:31.680
That's what he's like.

00:38:31.930 --> 00:38:33.520
Director, you're amazing.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:35.690
You know everything about film.

00:38:35.850 --> 00:38:37.810
It's all I have.

00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:42.190
I'm so happy that you've
watched such an old movie of mine.

00:38:42.360 --> 00:38:45.030
I've seen all your movies, Martin.

00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:46.530
Each one's a masterpiece.

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:50.530
I like you! No filming today. 
We'll drink until dawn!

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.200
No you won't.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.210
The light is in the upper right.

00:38:57.330 --> 00:38:59.750
We'll shoot with a little backlight.

00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:03.380
The director's very
particular about light.

00:39:03.510 --> 00:39:05.010
He's done so many tests.

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:09.180
It's where you take Dalbert
for a walk among the goats.

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:12.390
I guess he wants to do it in one take.

00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.470
Oh.

00:39:16.350 --> 00:39:17.230
Huh?

00:39:20.730 --> 00:39:25.240
I'm so sorry. The roof
fell in and scared them.

00:39:25.400 --> 00:39:27.400
We've patched it up, but--

00:39:27.570 --> 00:39:29.570
It was very rickety.

00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.080
But aren't there too few goats?

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:34.080
The thing is--

00:39:36.250 --> 00:39:38.080
They were eaten by wolves!?

00:39:38.750 --> 00:39:40.250
Poor things!

00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.200
What shall we do? There
aren't enough for the scene.

00:39:43.370 --> 00:39:44.800
Have you asked the goatherd?

00:39:44.970 --> 00:39:46.420
Impossible today, he says.

00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.590
Shoot it tomorrow?

00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:51.390
We don't have many location days,

00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:53.100
and the weather's shifting.

00:39:53.930 --> 00:39:55.890
There's fog.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:57.770
Fog.

00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:01.940
Do we have smoke?

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.770
Smoke?

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.800
No need to be scared.

00:40:30.970 --> 00:40:32.640
This way.

00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.480
The smoke was a great idea.

00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.810
The goats are just scary enough.

00:40:42.940 --> 00:40:46.820
And with the cutouts we
made, there are enough of them.

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.820
In the script, they
just went on a walk.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:53.990
Nice one, Gene!

00:41:02.170 --> 00:41:03.500
Today's a washout.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:06.210
Just shoot the interior scenes?

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.510
Gene. Gene!

00:41:17.350 --> 00:41:18.350
Wake up.

00:41:18.850 --> 00:41:22.600
Can I shoot a scene not in the script?

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.690
You're funny.

00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.860
Don't ask me. You're the boss.

00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:35.030
Why do I have to do this?

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:36.910
I'm royalty!

00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:39.290
Move your hands, not your lips.

00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.210
Hurry, before the goats catch a cold.

00:41:42.370 --> 00:41:44.370
Alright! Yes, ma'am!

00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:50.380
That's good.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:51.720
A great scene.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.010
I'll shoot the sky as the rain lifts.

00:41:54.130 --> 00:41:56.050
Hope we get a rainbow!

00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:59.180
- Director. 
- Yes?

00:41:59.310 --> 00:42:02.560
How about if I fall off the roof?

00:42:03.890 --> 00:42:07.690
I want to have Dalbert
be more humiliated.

00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.570
So let's have Lily laugh at him.

00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:14.400
Then Dalbert gets really
angry, and throws mud at Lily!

00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:15.860
Huh?

00:42:16.660 --> 00:42:19.240
Sorry for speaking out of turn.

00:42:19.660 --> 00:42:23.580
No, I was just surprised.
It's a great idea.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.380
I think he should land
in front of the door.

00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.250
Then a goat can come out and lick him.

00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:33.920
We'll make more mud
and get it really slippy.

00:42:34.090 --> 00:42:35.430
In that case--

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:03.370
You little brat!

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:08.040
You stuck-up twerp!

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.820
Gene!

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.070
Quick, shoot it!

00:43:48.330 --> 00:43:49.580
And cut!

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:52.790
Fantastic!

00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:55.340
The weather was on our side.

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.340
You shot a great scene!

00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:01.600
Thank you.

00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.350
Scene 42.

00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:06.020
A montage of Dalbert and Lily.

00:44:10.350 --> 00:44:14.320
Scene 44. Dalbert learns how to fish.

00:44:34.840 --> 00:44:37.630
That melody.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.730
Pompo!

00:44:50.890 --> 00:44:52.770
Stupendous!

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.730
That's the scene
we're making this for.

00:44:59.530 --> 00:45:02.740
I'm completely satisfied.
See you back in Nyallywood.

00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:06.080
You won't watch over us until the end?

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:08.910
I need to prepare the orchestra.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.250
So many people. A
scheduling nightmare.

00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:16.420
- Gene, Gene. 
- Yes?

00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:22.630
This picture's a surefire
Nyacademy Award-winner.

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:27.350
The rest is up to you, Director.

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.450
Stand by, please!

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:07.970
The guy from the plane.

00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:24.320
Thank you.

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:26.660
You're Gene, right?

00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:28.660
Always writing something.

00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:30.330
But what?

00:46:30.450 --> 00:46:31.950
My impressions of movies.

00:46:32.330 --> 00:46:33.250
Oh.

00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:42.510
Here. Don't just look
down, look ahead,

00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:45.180
or you'll lose something important.

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:48.510
- What were you doing? 
- Sorry!

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:53.850
Gene!

00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.690
Gene Fini!

00:46:58.360 --> 00:46:59.690
I thought it was you.

00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:02.530
It's me. Alan, from high school.

00:47:03.190 --> 00:47:04.030
Oh.

00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:11.950
A director? Wow.

00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:15.040
I can't believe it either.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:17.540
Sorry for ruining your notebook.

00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.210
It's fine.

00:47:19.330 --> 00:47:22.340
I'd memorized it all, so
I wrote it in a new one.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:23.380
Huh?

00:47:24.510 --> 00:47:26.720
What do you do now?

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:31.720
Nyallywood Bank?

00:47:31.970 --> 00:47:34.020
A major bank.

00:47:34.140 --> 00:47:35.730
It's shit.

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:46.070
I'm so sorry.

00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:48.740
I didn't know he hated golf.

00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:50.240
Enough already.

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.790
If you were on
the ball, you'd have

00:47:54.810 --> 00:47:57.920
researched the
client. It's basic stuff.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:01.250
I don't care if you were
a hotshot as a youth.

00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:04.590
You think you can
succeed without any effort?

00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.920
Sorry.

00:48:16.930 --> 00:48:19.730
I'm thinking of quitting.

00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:20.600
Why?

00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:23.440
I've never had ambitions,

00:48:23.940 --> 00:48:26.280
and did well at everything.

00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:29.400
But reality is harsh.

00:48:30.450 --> 00:48:33.280
Everything slips away.

00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:38.460
Sorry.

00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:39.620
Yes?

00:48:40.540 --> 00:48:41.630
I see.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:43.960
I have to go.

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:47.800
Alright. Let me know
when the film's finished.

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:49.300
I'll go watch it.

00:48:49.420 --> 00:48:50.630
Yeah, thanks.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.720
I take back what I said.

00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:59.480
Huh?

00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.230
You were always looking ahead.

00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.110
Your eyes sparkle now.

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:12.660
My eyes sparkle?

00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:23.920
Cut!

00:49:24.170 --> 00:49:27.000
That's a wrap!

00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:32.840
Let's drink!

00:49:35.260 --> 00:49:38.680
Grandma, I did it!

00:49:41.520 --> 00:49:44.900
Director, thank you so much!

00:49:52.360 --> 00:49:53.860
Director?

00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:56.330
The actors' work is done,

00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:59.200
but for him, it begins now.

00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:06.380
Right, editing.

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:10.050
Editing is the most vital stage.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.550
Everything's on Gene now.

00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:17.140
Editing his own movie? That's unusual.

00:50:17.470 --> 00:50:20.890
I always have directors
do it if they can.

00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:21.890
But--

00:50:22.060 --> 00:50:23.020
But?

00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.560
It's bound to be a masterpiece,

00:50:26.810 --> 00:50:29.230
but the editor is the first audience.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.860
Directing is subjective,
but editing is objective.

00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:34.570
I wonder if Gene...

00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:38.740
can bridge that gap,
and find the perfect cut.

00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:39.910
Huh?

00:50:41.750 --> 00:50:46.080
Time to edit. It's
gonna be so much fun!

00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:51.090
I must be the happiest
person in the world right now.

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:54.090
We shot about 72 hours of film.

00:50:54.260 --> 00:50:56.430
What should I do with it?

00:50:56.930 --> 00:51:00.100
It's a movie starring Martin Braddock.

00:51:00.350 --> 00:51:01.600
To make it impressive,

00:51:01.770 --> 00:51:05.440
I need lots of depth at
the start, lots of splendor.

00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:30.420
Not the whole concert.

00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:34.130
I'll jump-cut to the next
scene before it gets boring.

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:44.390
Dalbert, you conducted masterfully.

00:51:45.310 --> 00:51:48.150
Scene 12. Conversation
in the green room.

00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:51.770
We shot it in 8 cuts.

00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:54.150
I'll join them normally first.

00:51:55.740 --> 00:51:58.990
Dalbert, you conducted masterfully.

00:51:59.490 --> 00:52:03.450
Next time, find me a
better flautist, Coltman.

00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:06.710
How much do you think she cost?

00:52:07.290 --> 00:52:09.580
Tell me who I am.

00:52:10.630 --> 00:52:12.130
You're the king!

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:15.170
If the next concert is a success,

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:18.680
you'll become legendary worldwide.

00:52:18.840 --> 00:52:20.840
The next piece is St. Matthew Passion.

00:52:21.010 --> 00:52:22.600
An aria?

00:52:23.010 --> 00:52:24.180
You object?

00:52:24.350 --> 00:52:27.850
With you conducting, it'll be perfect.

00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:29.520
Technically, at least.

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:32.690
But an aria needs feeling.

00:52:32.940 --> 00:52:35.530
Which I can't provide?

00:52:35.650 --> 00:52:36.740
Tell me again.

00:52:37.780 --> 00:52:39.200
Who am I?

00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:45.950
There's nothing but exposition.

00:52:48.370 --> 00:52:49.540
So--

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:58.880
Next time, find me a
better flautist, Coltman.

00:52:59.050 --> 00:53:02.550
How much do you think she cost?

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:05.220
Tell me who I am.

00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:10.560
I'll use long shots at first to
make them curious about Dalbert.

00:53:10.890 --> 00:53:13.400
By emphasizing Martin's
emotionless delivery,

00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.400
I'll crank up the tension.

00:53:15.570 --> 00:53:20.360
Ordinarily, a medium shot
would provide a cushion,

00:53:20.490 --> 00:53:23.070
but I'll jump straight
to the close-up.

00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.410
Tell me again.

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:26.910
Who am I?

00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:31.420
That's it! Dalbert's prickly
personality comes across!

00:53:32.040 --> 00:53:33.920
I'll keep using this style.

00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:40.920
Scene 24. Page 20 of the script.

00:53:41.550 --> 00:53:43.680
Leaving for Switzerland at last.

00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.180
It's taken 90 minutes
of story to get here.

00:53:47.890 --> 00:53:51.770
He won't meet Lily
for another 30 minutes.

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:53.940
What can I do?

00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.570
Pompo's in Australia?

00:53:59.690 --> 00:54:03.950
Yes, location hunting with Corbett.

00:54:04.110 --> 00:54:05.620
When is she back?

00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:07.740
In two weeks.

00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:09.450
I see.

00:54:10.370 --> 00:54:12.290
Pompo has a message for you.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:13.790
Yes?

00:54:16.590 --> 00:54:19.960
I wanna see the final
cut when I get back!

00:54:20.130 --> 00:54:21.300
Don't let me down!

00:54:23.470 --> 00:54:24.550
That's what she said.

00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:28.470
I have no choice.

00:54:28.970 --> 00:54:30.560
Again, from the top.

00:54:33.980 --> 00:54:37.110
Dalbert, you conducted masterfully.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:54.460
Are you reading the score?

00:54:55.290 --> 00:54:56.670
Again, from the top!

00:54:58.670 --> 00:55:00.340
That orchestra is no good!

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.460
Are you crazy?

00:55:02.630 --> 00:55:04.680
The concert is in two weeks.

00:55:05.130 --> 00:55:07.340
We can't get another one!

00:55:11.310 --> 00:55:14.520
What does an aria mean to you?

00:55:22.690 --> 00:55:24.860
Dalbert, I quit.

00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.200
I hope you're ashamed.

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.250
You're too careless, Dalbert.

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:18.580
You should lock the door.

00:56:26.590 --> 00:56:31.050
We've worked together
for years. I feel responsible.

00:56:31.850 --> 00:56:33.510
How long has it been...

00:56:34.010 --> 00:56:36.270
since your wife and kid left you?

00:56:37.680 --> 00:56:39.520
Why do you ask that now?

00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:43.440
You need to take a break.

00:56:43.610 --> 00:56:46.780
Some time for self-reflection.

00:57:00.460 --> 00:57:04.800
Without music, I'm nothing.

00:57:09.130 --> 00:57:10.430
Mr. Peterzen.

00:57:18.310 --> 00:57:20.310
Excuse me.

00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.480
Wow.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.800
Oh, you're--

00:57:49.170 --> 00:57:50.170
I'm Gene.

00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.510
Sorry to disturb you.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.340
What are you doing?

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:56.510
Sorting out old film.

00:57:59.270 --> 00:58:02.190
Wow, it's a film splicer.

00:58:03.850 --> 00:58:05.360
An old man's hobby.

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:10.030
Trying to create a story
from discarded film.

00:58:10.190 --> 00:58:11.860
Just joining it together.

00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.370
The thing is--

00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:23.830
All the scenes seem important.

00:58:24.290 --> 00:58:26.340
Wonderful performances.

00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:30.010
But I have to cut more
to make it short enough.

00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:33.050
Why ask me and not Pompo?

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.890
Right, she wrote it, didn't she?

00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:46.060
What's the point of you being here...

00:58:46.190 --> 00:58:48.400
if you just do what she says?

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:49.400
Yes.

00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:53.070
Gene.

00:58:53.740 --> 00:58:56.410
For who are movies made?

00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:00.580
For the audience, I guess.

00:59:01.410 --> 00:59:05.580
And why do you love movies?

00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:12.260
You found yourself
in them, didn't you?

00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:17.260
Through the stories, you found
empathy, dreams, yearning.

00:59:17.390 --> 00:59:19.050
You saw reality.

00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:21.770
So, Gene,

00:59:22.930 --> 00:59:26.440
have you found yourself in your movie?

00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:34.440
Once you have,

00:59:34.610 --> 00:59:37.950
you should put your
aria into the film.

00:59:43.410 --> 00:59:44.620
My aria?

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:49.330
You've never walked in the mountains?

00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:52.300
How will that help my music?

00:59:56.300 --> 01:00:00.470
An aria is a solo piece
for expressing emotion.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:03.470
People call me a king!

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.890
I devoted everything to music!

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:07.900
Who for?

01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.490
So, what emotion...

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:19.660
are you trying to express, and to who?

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:23.660
It's all written here!

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.330
Again, from the top!

01:00:25.870 --> 01:00:26.750
What?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
You think the score's
wrong,are you're right?

01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:33.250
I just wanted to ask something.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:36.670
What does an aria mean to you?

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:40.840
This is--

01:00:46.980 --> 01:00:48.190
This is--

01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:55.320
Lily, that melody--

01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.560
This is me!

01:01:40.570 --> 01:01:41.570
Wait.

01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:43.410
In that case--

01:01:46.580 --> 01:01:49.080
Pompo is back!

01:01:49.410 --> 01:01:51.250
Welcome back.

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:53.920
Gene, show me the movie!

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:55.750
It isn't finished.

01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:59.420
It isn't finished.

01:02:00.260 --> 01:02:01.220
Just a little--

01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:02.590
It isn't finished.

01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:05.430
- How long is it? 
- I've begun again.

01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.930
There's still 72 hours of film.

01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:13.100
And the reason?

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:19.070
We have a screening in two weeks. 
The sponsors will be there.

01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:21.780
If it isn't ready,
they might pull out.

01:02:21.950 --> 01:02:25.450
So if it's just for some
trivial reason, then--

01:02:25.620 --> 01:02:26.620
I need more.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:29.950
Another scene.

01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:37.460
You wanna do additional shooting?

01:02:37.790 --> 01:02:38.630
Yes.

01:02:40.630 --> 01:02:42.630
As I'm sure you know,

01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.800
additional shooting means...

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:48.140
reassembling the whole crew.

01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:50.810
You know how hard that is?

01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.480
Kind of.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:54.650
Movies are made by a team.

01:02:54.770 --> 01:02:57.310
They're all on different projects now.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:00.780
We'll have to beg
everyone to reschedule.

01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.820
And who has to pay for it?

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:03.990
You do.

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:07.990
And reassembling
the cast is even harder.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:10.330
Who has to negotiate?

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.500
You do.

01:03:11.830 --> 01:03:15.000
Who wrote the script
that you say isn't enough?

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:16.000
You did.

01:03:16.330 --> 01:03:17.420
And you still say...

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.670
you need additional shooting?

01:03:25.010 --> 01:03:29.010
What's this all of a
sudden? Dalbert, are you crazy?

01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:31.680
You want to do the aria again?

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.530
Dalbert, give me a break!

01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:43.190
I never knew it.

01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:45.700
No, I'd forgotten it.

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:48.870
The smell of fish, the
pain of slipping in the rain.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.200
The bleating of goats!

01:03:52.540 --> 01:03:53.370
Huh?

01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.870
Emotions, memories are important.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.210
She made me remember that.

01:03:59.380 --> 01:04:01.460
Now I feel I can do it!

01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:06.550
You're washed up.
Why don't you give up?

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.550
Even so--

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:12.060
All I have is film!

01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:13.060
So--

01:04:13.180 --> 01:04:14.060
Please--

01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.560
My music needs--

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:17.190
My movie needs--

01:04:17.310 --> 01:04:19.860
- The aria of that day!
- Another scene!

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:20.980
I need it!

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:30.240
Pompo.

01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:37.000
I'll see what I can do.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.130
Damn! I never thought he'd defy me.

01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:48.090
He's so stubborn!

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.010
But--

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:52.600
You look so happy.

01:05:08.110 --> 01:05:10.280
What is it?

01:05:10.950 --> 01:05:12.120
The thing is,

01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:15.950
I want to quit--

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.790
What's this?

01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.960
Don't just take it.

01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.800
A movie investment proposal.

01:05:27.630 --> 01:05:30.630
I was just about to call
and turn them down.

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.300
Why?

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:36.640
They canceled a screening
because of the director,

01:05:36.810 --> 01:05:39.140
so their sponsors pulled out.

01:05:41.230 --> 01:05:44.310
Investing in movies is very high-risk.

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:47.650
Who knows if it'll ever be completed?

01:05:50.570 --> 01:05:54.320
Please let me handle it.

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:03.170
Well?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.840
It's perfect.

01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:09.340
I never thought I'd have
to write an additional scene.

01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:10.510
I'm sorry.

01:06:10.670 --> 01:06:13.680
I asked you to do it
to keep it consistent.

01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:18.180
I guess directors have to be
as arrogant and selfish as you.

01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.350
And what about this role?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.690
There's no time for auditions.

01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:28.530
Actually, I have someone in mind.

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.030
The Meister script?

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:38.990
It's the complete version,
with the additional scene.

01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:43.750
But without additional funding,

01:06:43.870 --> 01:06:46.380
we can't shoot the scene.

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:49.710
Actors can't do anything
in these situations.

01:06:57.810 --> 01:06:59.890
Mystia?

01:07:00.810 --> 01:07:04.560
Sorry! It's a great script, isn't it?

01:07:10.150 --> 01:07:12.400
This is awful.

01:07:13.070 --> 01:07:15.410
How to market it?

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:18.620
This is Peterzen Film.

01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:22.410
Alan from Nyallywood Bank?

01:07:23.410 --> 01:07:26.250
Your bank didn't get back to us, so...

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.250
I thought you'd rejected it.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:30.420
The bank itself has.

01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:32.090
However--

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.440
You're serious?

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.400
Great.

01:07:55.610 --> 01:07:57.780
Prepared to lose everything?

01:08:02.290 --> 01:08:05.120
Welcome to the world
of dreams and madness!

01:08:23.970 --> 01:08:25.810
You could get fired.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.980
Success requires effort.

01:08:31.150 --> 01:08:32.110
Right?

01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:33.780
Even so--

01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:42.330
Send me the data.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:46.000
You won't be ready at that rate.

01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:01.930
And so, I'd like us
to invest in Meister.

01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:05.680
Martin may be the star, but...

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:07.270
it's a first-time director.

01:09:07.480 --> 01:09:12.500
Movies with bad
publicity usually fail.

01:09:12.750 --> 01:09:14.290
The risk is too high for us to invest.

01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:20.530
That's all for today.

01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:24.030
I haven't finished yet!

01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:26.040
Huh?

01:09:30.170 --> 01:09:34.630
I've always been good
at becoming other people.

01:09:36.550 --> 01:09:39.380
Yes, it's always been my dream.

01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:43.390
My grandpa showed me lots of movies,

01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.890
but no film has ever truly moved me.

01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:50.390
So you want to make one that does?

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.690
But if I made it,

01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:55.400
it wouldn't move me, would it?

01:09:56.230 --> 01:09:59.400
So you're getting Gene to make it?

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:02.240
That's your dream.

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:05.910
Since when?

01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:07.580
Well--

01:10:10.910 --> 01:10:13.710
I've always loved watching movies.

01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.260
I had no friends, but I didn't care.

01:10:20.670 --> 01:10:24.930
I mean, there were so
many films I hadn't seen yet.

01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:28.930
There was a girl.

01:10:30.390 --> 01:10:32.770
In every theater I went to.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:38.070
But she always left when
the end credits began.

01:10:40.610 --> 01:10:42.450
I don't remember her face,

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:44.780
But I always wondered...

01:10:45.870 --> 01:10:48.950
why she came to watch the movies.

01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:52.790
Has she never been so engrossed...

01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.460
that she's watched
until the credits end?

01:11:00.800 --> 01:11:04.970
That's why I wanted
to make a movie myself.

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:08.310
As movies saved me,

01:11:08.890 --> 01:11:12.310
someone might be saved by mine.

01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:15.310
Then I saw it.

01:11:16.150 --> 01:11:17.980
Myself in the film.

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:22.990
This movie is for myself
all those years ago.

01:11:24.660 --> 01:11:26.990
No, not just for me.

01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.960
It needs a character that
everyone who watches it...

01:11:40.250 --> 01:11:43.670
can believe in and identify with.

01:11:44.170 --> 01:11:48.010
That's when I realized
it lacks a certain scene.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:52.430
A crucial scene that
will make it complete.

01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:58.270
To show what was discarded
in the pursuit of dreams.

01:11:59.190 --> 01:12:02.690
So please let me make this movie.

01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:10.660
I've always thought I'd
succeeded in everything.

01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:14.040
But looking back,
what have I achieved?

01:12:14.710 --> 01:12:16.370
I was just getting on with it.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:22.000
When I realized that, I
wondered what I could do.

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.380
A banker's job is to...

01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:27.890
help people fulfill their dreams.

01:12:28.640 --> 01:12:31.220
Please! We want to make a movie...

01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:34.390
that can give dreams to
people that have nothing!

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:39.900
I agree with what you say.

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:42.980
That's exactly what bankers should do.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:45.990
But your argument's lacking.

01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:49.990
You need to convince us with figures.

01:12:50.910 --> 01:12:51.910
Figures.

01:12:59.790 --> 01:13:01.750
- I have figures. 
- What?

01:13:05.170 --> 01:13:07.840
- Huh? 
- You've been filming this!?

01:13:08.090 --> 01:13:10.840
Sorry, but this whole meeting...

01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:12.890
has been streaming worldwide!

01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.100
What!?

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:23.270
This documentary is
also being streamed.

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:24.440
And also--

01:13:25.110 --> 01:13:26.440
Crowdfunding?

01:13:26.610 --> 01:13:29.700
We launched this website a
few days ago to raise funds.

01:13:30.450 --> 01:13:34.240
This was the first day,
and this is the figure now.

01:13:34.370 --> 01:13:36.450
And please note the viewing figures.

01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:46.800
You see the potential?

01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.140
That concludes my presentation.

01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:59.810
Stop streaming this.

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.820
I'm afraid your gamble has failed.

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:09.400
Take your belongings and go.

01:14:10.990 --> 01:14:12.990
There's no profit in dreams.

01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:24.840
Don't be so glum.

01:14:25.290 --> 01:14:28.550
It was a wonderful show.
You should be proud.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:31.180
President!

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.510
Stop streaming!

01:14:33.930 --> 01:14:37.010
One of my staff told me about it.

01:14:38.350 --> 01:14:39.680
I've been watching.

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:43.690
The best presentation
I've seen for a while.

01:14:43.850 --> 01:14:47.650
It needed firm resolution
and courage to pull off.

01:14:47.770 --> 01:14:51.030
And it has more than enough potential.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:55.700
We'll invest 10 times
the crowdfunding figure.

01:14:56.830 --> 01:14:57.530
President!

01:14:57.700 --> 01:15:01.000
You guys assess potential
only looking at past figures,

01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:03.370
so you can't see the essence.

01:15:03.540 --> 01:15:04.710
What do you mean?

01:15:09.050 --> 01:15:12.550
Look at when the crowdfunding
suddenly increased.

01:15:13.010 --> 01:15:16.680
You know what was
happening at that moment?

01:15:17.470 --> 01:15:22.060
Gene Fini and Alan were
pouring their hearts out.

01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:27.230
Assessing potential
means looking to the future.

01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.990
They were evaluating
their dreams, their future.

01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:36.110
But, President--

01:15:36.410 --> 01:15:40.080
Nyallywood Bank invests in
people pursuing their dreams.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:41.750
That's our motto.

01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:44.370
I've never heard that motto before.

01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:45.750
I just thought of it.

01:15:47.040 --> 01:15:51.090
Alan, I have high hopes
for your future, too.

01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:57.590
Yeah!

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.940
Well done.

01:16:05.850 --> 01:16:06.940
Thank you!

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:11.940
It's been a long time since
we had such a crazy meeting!

01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:15.610
It reminds me of when the
president was a junior executive.

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:17.570
Alright, you win!

01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.370
We'll invest!

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:36.300
Thank you all for
coming back to do this.

01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:40.050
Don't worry.

01:16:40.300 --> 01:16:43.310
We're all here to shoot
a crucial scene, right?

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.810
Everyone.

01:16:48.810 --> 01:16:50.150
Thank you so much!

01:16:50.650 --> 01:16:55.320
It's a flashback to when
Dalbert lost his family.

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.320
Who's playing his wife?

01:16:57.490 --> 01:16:58.740
I am.

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.120
I'm Martin Braddock.
Best actor in the world.

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:06.830
Wanna network socially?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.830
I don't have a smartphone.

01:17:09.330 --> 01:17:10.830
Have we met before?

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.750
What are you talking about?

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.510
Wow. Mystia looks
nothing like her usual self.

01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:17.840
Of course not.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.480
Thanks to Nyallywood's

01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:21.180
top prosthetic makeup artist.

01:17:22.350 --> 01:17:28.020
Don't tell anyone Mystia's in this.
Her credit will be a pseudonym.

01:17:28.190 --> 01:17:30.350
She doesn't like the role?

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.020
Well--

01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:37.690
Alright, but it has
to be a secret, OK?

01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:39.860
You're ashamed to be in it?

01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:42.370
No, it's just that one day,

01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:47.370
I'll make a movie
with Gene and Natalie.

01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:49.500
I'm sure I will.

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:51.040
But...

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:55.710
I'll have to have the lead role.

01:17:56.210 --> 01:18:00.720
Until then, I don't want to
appear in Gene's movies.

01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.220
That sounds great.

01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:06.220
We'll make you a different person.

01:18:06.390 --> 01:18:07.220
Alright!

01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:10.390
Pompo?

01:18:11.520 --> 01:18:13.400
Shoot it already!

01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:19.070
And action!

01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:24.240
And so, thanks to Pompo's
amazing skill as a producer,

01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:27.740
and the crew's effort, we made it.

01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:32.710
Excuse me.

01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:34.420
Director Gene--

01:18:34.540 --> 01:18:35.880
What a mess!

01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:38.920
What's up, Natalie?

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:43.260
Mystia said you were busy
editing, so I brought some food.

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:45.930
You have huge bags under your eyes!

01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:48.930
I haven't slept much.

01:18:49.770 --> 01:18:52.900
How much lack of sleep
produces those bags?

01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:56.610
I don't remember much
of the last three days.

01:18:56.730 --> 01:18:58.440
You'll die!

01:18:59.110 --> 01:19:02.780
Thanks to the investment,
we can make the movie,

01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:05.740
but we have to show it in a week.

01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:09.620
How much do you still have to cut?

01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:12.460
About 3 hours.

01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:15.790
That much!? Do you have enough time?

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.460
I have a week, so probably.

01:19:27.970 --> 01:19:28.930
Pompo!

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:30.310
How's Gene?

01:19:30.930 --> 01:19:32.480
He's sleeping.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:37.820
He isn't injured.
They think it's anemia.

01:19:37.980 --> 01:19:38.820
You mean--

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:39.980
Overwork.

01:19:41.150 --> 01:19:46.320
The doctor says he
needs a week of bedrest.

01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:48.990
A whole week?

01:19:52.160 --> 01:19:57.000
If Gene can't edit it, we'll
have to ask someone else.

01:20:12.180 --> 01:20:14.520
You look so peaceful asleep.

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:18.360
I was so looking forward
to seeing your movie.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.200
I wanted to see it.

01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:37.040
Gene.

01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:39.040
Huh?

01:20:41.170 --> 01:20:43.210
I thought you'd be here.

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:46.050
Let's go back to hospital.

01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:47.380
I can't.

01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:48.890
Gene!

01:20:50.010 --> 01:20:54.060
If someone else edits it, it
won't be my movie anymore.

01:20:54.350 --> 01:20:55.180
Huh?

01:20:56.640 --> 01:21:00.900
I was reminded of something
during the additional shooting.

01:21:02.230 --> 01:21:03.900
How old is Lyla now?

01:21:04.650 --> 01:21:06.400
I won't let you see her.

01:21:06.570 --> 01:21:08.910
But this is crazy.

01:21:10.070 --> 01:21:12.740
So choose, right now.

01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:15.580
Us, or your music.

01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:22.750
That's your answer.

01:21:25.260 --> 01:21:27.380
I should give up music?

01:21:27.720 --> 01:21:30.340
You never saw us.

01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:34.850
You can't have both, Dalbert.

01:21:40.770 --> 01:21:42.610
Let me just say this.

01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:45.860
Your music is wonderful.

01:21:47.440 --> 01:21:48.450
But...

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.110
the aria you played me once...

01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:54.950
was absolutely awful.

01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:10.470
To create something great,

01:22:11.300 --> 01:22:13.930
you have to sacrifice everything else.

01:22:14.970 --> 01:22:16.310
Not just your own life,

01:22:16.810 --> 01:22:19.980
but everyone's, and their money too.

01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:22.310
And so...

01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.820
there's no way I can give up now.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:40.500
In that case, I'll be by your side.

01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:41.420
Huh?

01:22:42.170 --> 01:22:45.670
It's my movie too, you know?

01:22:58.350 --> 01:23:01.850
You're absolutely unbelievable!

01:23:15.370 --> 01:23:17.700
My first cut!

01:23:17.870 --> 01:23:19.370
Sorry.

01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:22.210
It's unnecessary.

01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:25.380
My first shot with Martin!

01:23:55.410 --> 01:23:56.370
I--

01:23:58.490 --> 01:24:01.080
I trust you!

01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:13.380
Life is a series of choices.

01:24:14.050 --> 01:24:17.760
Choosing one path means
cutting out all the others.

01:24:18.550 --> 01:24:19.430
So...

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:21.430
cut out conversation.

01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:26.940
Cut out friendship.

01:24:30.610 --> 01:24:32.610
Cut out family.

01:24:34.950 --> 01:24:37.110
Cut out daily life.

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:40.910
Cut.

01:24:41.030 --> 01:24:42.700
Cut, cut.

01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.250
Cut!

01:25:17.570 --> 01:25:18.660
In order to...

01:25:19.490 --> 01:25:21.490
keep what's left over.

01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.500
In order not to give up.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000
Cut!

01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:46.020
This is my--

01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:47.940
My--

01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:51.190
My aria!

01:26:02.370 --> 01:26:04.990
Have you finished?

01:26:05.370 --> 01:26:08.040
Maybe. Even I don't know.

01:26:08.210 --> 01:26:09.710
Huh?

01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:13.380
Who knows what's correct?

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:15.500
Oh, but how long is it?

01:26:15.630 --> 01:26:16.510
How long?

01:26:46.910 --> 01:26:49.330
This is your aria.

01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:59.090
Dalbert, you're amazing.

01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:11.940
Because you've
devoted yourself to music.

01:27:14.100 --> 01:27:16.110
Is the conductor smiling?

01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:18.940
You found your aria.

01:27:19.190 --> 01:27:20.280
Mom?

01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:25.120
Dreams and memories
lying dormant in music.

01:27:25.910 --> 01:27:29.950
You've invoked them all into sound.

01:27:31.710 --> 01:27:33.620
In exchange for loneliness.

01:27:35.290 --> 01:27:39.630
Heard no more, clumsy, the worst.

01:27:40.130 --> 01:27:42.300
An aria just for us.

01:27:47.810 --> 01:27:48.930
It's strange.

01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:53.140
I feel this brings back memories.

01:28:49.700 --> 01:28:51.540
Pompo, I--

01:28:57.790 --> 01:28:59.540
You're a real director.

01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:04.050
Your film.

01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:06.720
I love it.

01:29:12.720 --> 01:29:15.890
Sure enough, just as Pompo predicted,

01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.060
our movie was a massive hit.

01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:20.560
Hello?

01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:24.070
Yes, I really hope you consider it.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:30.410
Yes, I'll be right there!

01:29:35.330 --> 01:29:36.410
And then--

01:29:36.910 --> 01:29:40.750 line:20%
Meister has won three awards already.

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:40.250
<i>Best Actor: Martin Braddock</i>

01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:46.010 line:20%
Will it win the remaining
Best Director and Best Picture?

01:29:41.290 --> 01:29:43.250
<i>Best Actress: Natalie Woodward</i>

01:29:44.300 --> 01:29:46.010
<i>Best Screenplay: 
J. D. Peterzen (Agency)</i>

01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:49.760
Then the anteater grown
huge by gamma rays...

01:29:49.930 --> 01:29:51.930
starts licking her with its tongue!

01:29:52.050 --> 01:29:53.680
That's my kind of movie!

01:29:53.810 --> 01:29:56.770
The Nyacademy Award
for Best Director goes to...

01:29:57.270 --> 01:30:01.690 line:20%
Gene Fini! Best
Picture goes to Meister!

01:29:58.230 --> 01:30:01.690
<i>Best Director: Gene Fini</i>

01:30:07.240 --> 01:30:11.450
Director, tell us what you
like most about this film.

01:30:12.450 --> 01:30:14.700
What I like most?

01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:22.960
The thing I like most...

01:30:28.630 --> 01:30:32.470
is that it's 90 minutes long.
