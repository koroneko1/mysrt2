Oh, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming.

Uh, excuse me, just a moment.

46
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,860
I would like to ask you something.

47
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,278
What?

48
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:27,952
Um, you were in this area with a man before, right?

49
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:34,334
Oh, it doesn't have anything to do with you.

50
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,544

Oh, we got picked on by a pervert.

61
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:57,125
So the man with an eye patch came after you specifically, Sunhee?

62
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:59,210
Well, I don't know, it was really annoying.

00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:01,838
Huh?

00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,258
What are the odds of seeing Jinseop at a place like this?

65
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,219
Yeah, right. He always eats alone. I wonder why he's eating here...

66
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:12,640
JIYOUNG: Maybe he wants to hang out with people like us sometimes.

Then I'll just hurry and record it.

140

Once they listen to the complete version,

141
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:55,548
everyone would think that it's my song and that I wrote it myself.

142

What if you run into problems after recording?

143
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:04,390
He said it's not copyrighted. Others might claim it first.

144
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,769
You're right, there's someone who already arranged and posted it.

155

Then first, I'll check the horoscope for your date of birth.

(keyboard clacking)

157

Tell me your birthday.

158
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:16,939
Well...

159
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,611
It's not the horoscope I want. I came to ask a question.

160
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,489
Please go ahead.

161
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,372
Um, what do all of those mean?

162
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,541
They are symbols of the planets in the solar system.

163
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,335
Ah...

164
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,270
Then what about this?

165
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,606
That is Pluto.

166
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,941
Pluto...

167
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:09,491
Then could Pluto, November 29th, and December 12th,

168
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:13,078
be linked in any way based on astrology?

169
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,331
(keyboard clanking)

170
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:23,172
Both dates are days when Pluto and Venus make a conjunction.

171
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:27,718
Conjunction?

172
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:32,723
YOUNGRAN: Okay, this is Pluto and this is Venus.

173
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,561
Can you see that both planets' symbols are inside the same boundary?

174
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,691
Multiple planets gathered to form angles

175
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:47,446
within the same boundary are called "conjunction."

176
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:53,786
What's all this?

177
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,874
Each star symbolizes different meanings.

178
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,128
If Venus is a symbol of beauty and art,

179
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:07,132
then Pluto symbolizes destruction and regeneration.

180
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:12,846
The King of the Underworld, sometimes called the Grim Reaper.

181
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:18,560
In other words, it could be a cycle of death and art.

182
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:29,405
Then when would that conjunction take place again?

183
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:32,866
It's not a common occurrence.

184
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,246
(keyboard clanking)

185
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,332
YOUNGRAN: December 20th, and then...

186
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,835
(keyboard clanking)

187
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,420
December 25th.

188
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,131
On Christmas too?

189
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:52,011
YOUNGRAN: When the orb hits zero, December 12th and December 25th

190
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,806
are placed at the center of conjunction,

191
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,267
and the cycle goes into retrograde.

192
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,352
When the conjunction begins again,

193
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,361
it ends on January 6th.

194
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:15,951
(pencil rasping)

195
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:31,091
(doorbell dings)

196
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,177
(rasping continues)

197
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,485
(doorbell ding continues)

198
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:01,205
How did you know where I live?

199
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,252
I know everything about you, Jinseop.

200
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,970
What do you know about me?

201
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:26,438
Could you try to get to know me first?

202
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,946
If you just tell me to go away...

203
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:40,410
JINSEOP: Come in, for now.

204
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,211
(door lock beeps)

205
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:01,890
It looks cleaner than a model house.

206
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:11,483
Do you want to get yourself clean too?

207
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:17,030
You said you wanted to show me everything.

208
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,085
(pensive music)

209
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,575
RELIABLE POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY NAMBU POLICE STATION

210
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,036
-(siren blares) -DETECTIVE CHOI: Oh, Youngran, what's up?

211
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:06,246
What?

212
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,541
And then?

213
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,836
Yeah.

214
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,797
You want me to come over there?

215
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,842
Ah, you'll come over?

216
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,677
How long will it take?

217
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,611
Oh. It was the symbol for Pluto.

218
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:39,780
That's right, symbol for Pluto.

219
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:42,658
YOUNGRAN: Actually, the meaning behind constellations or stars

220
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:45,994
are interpreted differently depending on the country.

221
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:52,084
In a Christian viewpoint, Venus is interpreted as Lúcĭfer.

222
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,795
-Known as Lucifer. -What?

223
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,797
The devil?

224
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,508
(breathes heavily)

225
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,388
YOUNGRAN: That's right, the devil.

226
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:06,890
Also called the fallen angel.

227
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,809
(grunting)

228
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,686
(moans)

229
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,106
DETECTIVE CHOI: The devil. Fallen angel.

230
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:19,152
Okay, fine, but how did that young man

231
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:23,907
find out about the date of the murder

232
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:27,119
and its connection to astrology?

233
00:21:27,202 --> 00:21:31,248
This... This Pluto symbol, it's classified.

234
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,332
Classified?

235
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:33,458
Yeah.

236
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:35,877
(inhales sharply)

237
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,922
I did tell him about the calculation

238
00:21:39,006 --> 00:21:43,844
for the dates of conjunction occurrence.

239
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,471
What does he look like? His characteristics?

240
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,850
-Firstly... -Yeah.

241
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:52,185
-He's good-looking. -Hey, Gye Youngran, damn it...

242
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,146
-Okay, okay. -(tongue clicks)

243
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,691
Eye patch.

244
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:00,902
Eye patch?

245
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,487
He had an eye patch on his right eye.

246
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,656
-Hey, give me that thing, hurry up. -Yes, sir.

247
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,949
Come on.

248
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,785
(clears throat)

249
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,999
Mm, handsome.

250
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,000
Hey, come on!

251
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,335
It's him, this man.

252
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:18,295
Hey, put this guy on the suspects list,

253
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,964
and, uh, check all CCTV footage

254
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:25,594
within two kilometer radius, and trace his movements.

255
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,970
Yes, sir.

256
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,263
(clears throat)

257
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,102
Is that guy really the culprit?

258
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,146
Not yet. Well, I don't know yet.

259
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,274
Hey, thanks for your help.

260
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,650
Treat me to a meal.

261
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:41,860
(chuckles) Okay, got it.

262
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:43,362
(chuckles)

263
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,240
-Let's go eat. -Yeah.

264
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:09,638
SUNHEE: How can it be so perfectly organized...

265
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,646
(scoffs)

266
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,428
(light music)

267
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:27,174
(foreboding music)

268
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:45,942
Found him!

269
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:48,069
Here, the eye patch, the eye patch.

270
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,989
(beeping)

271
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:55,702
What? This is that psychopath?

272
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:57,996
(indistinct radio chatter)

273
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:01,750
Play it again.

274
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,044

277
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,252

278
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,712

MAN: Oh, oh, oh, hey, hey, hey, where are you going?

280
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,764
Come here, huh? Come here!

281
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:01,142
Hey you little runt, come here. Oh, my goodness.

282
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,812
Huh? Oh my, hey, where are you going?

283
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:09,484
Hey, Pipi, what are you barking at? What is it, huh? What's wrong?

284
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,612
(dog barking)

285
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,365

FOURTH

290

FOURTH CORPSE ART FOUND ON DECEMBER 25TH…

-(indistinct chatter) -(cameras clicking)

296
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,752
DETECTIVE CHOI: It's really in that order of dates?

297
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:55,090
Then the next would be January 6th, and there's only about ten days left.

298
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,259
Come on, do you believe that? Damn it.

299
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,011
We'll catch him somehow before it happens.

-Oh, hey, that, that, that bastard. -Get that bastard first!

00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,046
Hey.

309
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:52,689
Sunhee, is something wrong?

310
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,191
Where is Jinseop?

311
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,945
I don't think he's come in yet.

312
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,488
Shouldn't he be in soon?

313
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,575
(whispers) I was hoping you could help me.

314
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:07,495
What can I help you with?

315
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,915
(inhales deeply)

316

(suspenseful music)

317
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,890
Go this way.

319
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:36,900

-This bastard. -(grunting)

00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,750
Come here, you bastard!

00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,302
Ew, this is gross.

338
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,724
Hey, hurry up and put this back on yourself.

339
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,351
(breathing heavily)

340
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:58,273
Why... why are you doing this to me?

341
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,484
That's none of your business.

342
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,989
(groans)

343
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:14,622
(grunts)

344
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,629
(laughs)

345
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:29,178
That's amazing, Connect.

346
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,266
Co... connect?

347
00:31:33,349 --> 00:31:35,310
(snickers)

348
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,689
What do you want to do?

349
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,610
If you want to keep this a secret, you'd better kill him now.

350
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,404
Ki... kill him?

351
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,822
(Eunpyo grunts)

352
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,992
(Eunpyo exhales deeply)

353
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,328
The cops will be here soon.

354
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,455
-(electricity crackles) -(grunts)

355
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,584
If you want to kill him, you must hurry.

356
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,594
(breathing shakily)

357
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:12,096
DETECTIVE PARK: Stop right there, you son of a bitch!

358
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,557
(both grunt)

359
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,601
-(groans) -Ugh...

360
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,478
Hey, who were you chasing, huh?

361
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:19,979
(pants)

362
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,982
I was just jogging, what are you talking about?

363
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,108
Ugh...

364
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,239
(panting)

365
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:40,333
(both pant)

366
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:48,841
You, you weren't with them?

367
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,844
(Irang panting)

368
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:58,142
I figured they would lead me to you, so I followed them.

369
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:00,269
(panting)

370
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:06,651
He called me Connect. Was that what you wanted to check?

371
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:12,407
At least, I don't think of you as some bundle of money.

372
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,076
Bundle of money?

373
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:18,079
What do you know about Connect?

374
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,831
(breathes deeply)

375
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,624
It's kind of a long story...

376
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,418
Do you have a phone?

377
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,967
What are you... Give it back, now.

378
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,885
I'm making it too easy. No fun.

379
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,724
(cell phone vibrates)

380
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:44,313
I'm Choi Irang. Save my number.

381
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,778
If you don't call, I will. What's your name?

382
00:33:51,362 --> 00:33:52,655
You don't need to know.

383
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,244
I think you should hide out here for a bit longer.

384
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,455
If you want to stay here, then you can do that.

385
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:04,876
(sighs)

386
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:22,018
Hi, I want to talk to you alone.

387
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,025
(beeps)

388
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,155
-It will be quick. -(elevator dings)

389
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,282
(elevator door opens)

390
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:06,104
I saw something at your place when I came over.

391
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:09,107
The sketch book.

392
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,109
Ah...

393
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,278
There were things like corpse art drawings.

394
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,990
Surprisingly well-drawn...

395
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:21,119
Aren't those drawings popular online for being artistic?

396
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,704
I was just copying them.

397
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:28,459
Then what about the drawing of this morning's murder?

398
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:30,920
SUNHEE: Where'd you find that?

399
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:35,508
It seemed like you drew it before the murder even happened.

400
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:42,473
I also saw the drawing on the last page.

401
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,311
What are all those?

402
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:51,357
You saw them all?

403
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,526
(chuckles)

404
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,407
(cell phone rings)

405
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:04,162
MAN: Man, where did everyone go?

406
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,540
Ah, I'll try calling Sunhee.

407
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:12,920
Well, Jinseop, I'm just…

408
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,631
I don't really know what's going on,

409
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,384
but Sunhee asked me to…

410
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,428
No, Myunghoon.

411
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:24,223
This man, this guy is...

412
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,395
He... he's a murderer.

413
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,689
