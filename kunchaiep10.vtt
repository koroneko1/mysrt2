00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Bloodstain.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You did this behind me?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What are you doing in my room?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Yang.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.000
You should beware of this man.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.000
I feel like this man is dangerous.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.000
He's hiding something from us.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Maybe if he sleeps with a girl, he might like it.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.000
But if we put the orchid dust in the cicada, 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.000
it will become cicada orchids with arousal property.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.000
Doctor Qi leaving the house like this, they must have a plan.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000
But it's good for us.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.000
It's the right time to make cicada orchids.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.000
When the dust flies to catch the cicada, 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.000
it will make them breed like crazy.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.000
In order to find the strong one that survived.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The weak cicadas will not be able to withstand the effects of the orchid dust

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.000
and eventually died.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
After that, we wait for the mushroom to grow out of its body.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Why is the cicada making such a loud noise?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Burn them all. 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Li. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
What's going on?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The cicadas are infected, so they all died.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
But I ordered the workers to burn them. 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.000
Don't worry.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Excuse me. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Sorry. 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Mei.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Mei.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Fu, why is Mei like this?

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000
I don't know either.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
She has been like this for a while now.

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:50.000
She stays in bed all day, and gets up and play with me once in a while.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
But she didn't feel sick like before.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
And how are you here?

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
We have food every meal

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000
but we're not as happy as when we were at home.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.000
When will we go back to our home?

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Let me accomplish an important task first.

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.000
Wait a little longer.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Have you met Tian lately?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Why do you ask?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Well...

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Do you see?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.000
That I take care of your siblings and let them live comfortably.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I provide both food and medicine.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.000
Don't worry about anything.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Just do your job. 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Right?

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000
From what you told me, Big Brother doesn't trust Li anymore.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
He must have believed that Li had killed someone

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
to conceal Tian's secret.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
I think that what it is. 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.000
Otherwise, Doctor Qi wouldn't be invited to investigate the strange herbs and mushroom.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Li is decisive.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
But I didn't think that she could be this cruel.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
If she can kill, 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000
it means Tian's secret must be very important, very serious. 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
So have you seen anything suspicious about his secret?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Not yet.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
But I came today because a strange thing happened last night.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Last night, the cicadas made loud noises throughout the house.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Why is that strange?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
It's strange because its noises were louder than I've heard before.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000
And by the next morning, they were all dead.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Then Madam Li ordered the workers to tidy up and burn the remains.

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.000
Saying that it was because of an insect disease.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000
But from what I see, it’s not, so I collected its remain to let you check it.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Jiu. Jiu. 

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Fu, I'm going back now, what's up?

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Yes, about Tian.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
What's about Tian?

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
I heard Mr. Ma talking to someone. 

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.000
He said that he sent a guy to Tian's house.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
You must warn Tian.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.000
Don't let those bad guy hurt him.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
If I could, I would like to protect Tian from those evil bastards.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
Please do it instead of me. 

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Get rid of those wicked bastards.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000
We have managed to burn all the weak cicadas already. 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
I'm going out to find the strong cicada

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:20.000
that survived from the power of orchid dust tonight. 

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Soon we will have the cicada orchid ready to be used. 

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000
This is the strongest cicada.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Who are you?

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Or is it Mr. Ma's subordinate?

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Tian.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Tian, Tian. 

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Tian.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Tian.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Tian.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Tian.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Tian.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Jiu. 

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Tian.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Are you okay?

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
I'm really worried about you.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Hey. 

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
I am fine. 

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Why did you come into my room?

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000
I saw a stranger entering the house.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
I'm afraid he will hurt you.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
So you're alright?

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Nobody hurt you, right?

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
And what is this?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Paint. 

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I dropped it when I was painting.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Paint?

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
If you're alright, I'll leave.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000
I'm glad…

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
that you are worried about me.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
I thought you were still mad at me.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I'm not mad at you.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
If you are not angry with me, 

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000
from today, 

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
let's study as usual. 

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
See you tomorrow.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
It's me. 

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
What's wrong with you, Jia? Who injured you?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000
It's Jiu. 

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
But don't worry. He didn't know it was me.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Jiu?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
The man that Tian accepted for work?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I think this guy looks suspicious.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
He's agile, good at fighting. He's not like an ordinary worker.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Keep an eye on him. 

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
So did you get the cicada that survived?

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Soon.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000
We will get cicada orchid to make arousal drug.

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:48.000
Good.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000
When Tian has a wife and children and becomes the head of the association, 

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
that day, I can die in peace.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000
You are nimble, not like other workers.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
What did you do before staying here?

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Why are you asking?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Mr. Tian is the heir of the Song Family.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Besides the people who come to seek benefits, 

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
he's also a target of murder. 

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.000
You.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:07.000
I have to beware those who come close to Mr. Tian.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
And you, 

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000
If you want to stay here for a long time, don't be so inquisitive.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000
They have been discussing for a long time.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Or do they not like my land?

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.000
Is it too expensive? Should I give them a discount?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000
No, if you offer discount, you won't get enough money to buy back the palace.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Do you like it?

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Yes, but I think the price is too high. 

00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.000
I just took a look at the land nearby.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.000
It's cheaper than yours for a hundred thousand.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
But mine is right next to the river.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.000
Most importantly, there will be a road running through the land. 

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.000
You should probably heard the news as well.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
But I don't quite like the land next to the river.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I'm not partial to water.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.000
But if you give lower the price a bit more, 

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
I will buy it right away. 

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000
Sorry for being late.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Madam, are you making an appointment with another customer as well?

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Do you guys come to look at the land too?

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:48.000
Yes, and this is my boss. 

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
He's very interested in this land. 

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Right, Sir?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Yes. 

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.000
He's looking for a place in Bang Pa-in

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.000
to build a vacation home.

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:06.000
And most importantly, the land here is very beautiful.

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:08.000
The atmosphere is also good, next to the river.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000
She's selling very cheaply.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:14.000
I thought my boss would have missed this place.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
I hope that you haven't sold the land to other customers yet.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
You can't, Madam. 

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
I've been here first. You have to give me the chance first.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000
But my boss offers you four hundred thousand, Madam.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Four hundred twenty thousand.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000
I give you four hundred fifty thousand.

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Four hundred thousand...

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.000
Come here. / What?

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Yang, that's enough.

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.000
If they don't take it, we'll be in trouble.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Come on, I'll take care of it myself.

00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.000
Madam.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
My brother said it was too little.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Five hundred thousand is better.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
If you want the land at five hundred thousand, 

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
you can take it, sir. 

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Yang. 

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000
It's normal for new millionaires.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000
How can you compete with my boss?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Let's make a contract, Madam. 

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
I give you six hundred thousand.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Wow. 

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Thanks a lot, Yang.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:43.000
If it wasn't you and Tian, I still probably couldn't sell the land and wouldn't get this price.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Even if you couldn't sell, I will help you until you sell it anyway.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And your land is about to have a road running through. Many people want it.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
But I'm a bit sad. 

00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:01.000
It's like I sold the lands of my ancestors for money.

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:02.000
I destroy the treasures. 

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Don't worry too much, your ancestors must be happy

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
that their wealth has helped the children. 

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Really?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000
You suddenly turned your face away from me and sighed. What does it mean?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Even though I and Tian break off the engagement, 

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
what about you and me?

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
What is it between you and me?

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
I'm kidding.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Hey, don’t worry. 

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:50.000
I know that we still have many problems ahead of us. 

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
I know because I'm your ex-fiancé's brother.

00:23:54.300 --> 00:23:55.000
But don't worry.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.000
I believe that we can go through all these problems.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Believe me.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Let's eat cake.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Thanks. 

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Tian is back. The desserts are here.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Sit down, bro.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Wow, you bought a lot of books.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
I want Jiu to practice reading a lot so that he can be fluent.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Jiu, the one you said that he seemed to be mad at you?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
So how is it?

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
I am worried about myself and let you help me a lot.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
We understand each other well now.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Let's eat. 

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
My love. 

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
I'd like two more plates, please.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
What?

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:03.000
What do you mean that you will not marry Tian?

00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.000
Right, Father. 

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
After we get the money, we'll pay the debt to Aunt Li.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
And it's done.

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:14.000
How can you do this all of a sudden?

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.000
If they find out, I'll lose credibility.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.000
I already told you that I didn't want to get married.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
I don't love Tian.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:26.000
But he is a good man.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000
But I still don't love him anyway.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I don't want to be with someone I don't love, Father.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000
You'll love each other eventually. 

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
No, I can't love anyone else.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.000
Huh?

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
What do you mean? Do you already have someone you love?

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Nangnoi. 

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Tell me now who is this man?

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:51.000
Where is he?

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
I won't tell you. 

00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.000
And if you still force me to do this, 

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
I will run away.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
It's here. 

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Five hundred sacks of rice.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:24.000
Five hundred sacks.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000
Your handwriting has become more beautiful.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
But the number five is not written like this.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:41.000
It's written like this. 

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
I'm sorry, I can't remember. 

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.000
It's okay.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000
In the past, I wrote things in the wrong way as well. 

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
My handwriting is a lot worse than yours right now.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Father. 

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
I'm checking the accounts.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.000
Do you want anything?

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
No. 

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
I just came to check.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Go ahead. 

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Yes, Father. 

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Li. 

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Do you know anything about the new worker named Jiu?

00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.000
Who is he? Where does he come from?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Why? What's the matter?

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Why are you shocked?

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
What's the problem?

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
I just asked about a worker.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000
I wasn't shocked. I'm just surprised that you ask me. 

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
So do you know or not?

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
I don't know who he is.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.000
I only knew that he had saved Tian's life.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Usually you know everything about Tian. 

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Even his secret, 

00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:40.000
you also know that, right?

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Despite your sarcastic remark, 

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:48.000
it didn't make me know more than you.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Zhang, Zhang. 

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Zhang, Zhang. 

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:24.000
I wish you know the pain that I got. 

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.000
Zhang. 

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Zhang. 

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Tian. 

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
I'm sorry.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000
What happened?

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
I'm a homosexual. 

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
No, it can't be true. 

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Tian. 

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000
I hope that someday you will experience the pain that I had suffered.

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.000
You will understand how I feel. 

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.000
Zhang. 

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Tian, this is not true.

00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:01.000
It shouldn't be you. Not you. Tian!

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Tian. 

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Tian. 

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Tian. 

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Tian. 

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000
(Blessing)

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Amen.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Why did you wake up early today to offer food to the monks with me?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
I'm a sinner.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
I usually don’t go to the temple to make merit.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000
When I decided to make one, 

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000
it seems strange.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
It's not what I mean, Sir.

00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:01.000
I saw your face didn't look good, so I ask you this.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.000
Are you not feeling well?

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Maybe I'm really a sinner.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Why do you think that?

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.000
That time, I didn't protect Zhang. 

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
So he decided to end his life. 
320
00:31:21,000 --&gt; 00:31:00,000
I'm afraid that this sin will go to my children instead. 

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:24.000
I have a feeling that something bad will happen to them. 

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
A bad premonition happened because you felt guilty for Mr. Zhang.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Mr. Tian and Mr. Yang both are boys. 

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Even though they are targeted, they'll be safe eventually.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
But if you still feels uneasy, 

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:45.000
let's find a day to make merit at the temple.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000
So you will be more at ease.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Since I let Jiu work for me, he can help me a lot.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Even though he can't write and read, 

00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:00.000
he is determined and is quick-witted.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
I think he will be fluent soon.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Jiu is really talented.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
What about his family?

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
His parents are dead.

00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:17.000
He only has two younger siblings left. They are now living with a relative.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
That's all. 

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000
And what about his wife?

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
He doesn't have one. 

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
He's fine-looking.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Why doesn't he have a wife?

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Why do you ask about Jiu?

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:42.000
I saw that he worked closely with you, 

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000
so I want to know his background.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Can you trust him?

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Don't worry. 

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000
I can trust him, he saved my life once. 

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Keep working. 

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Bang Pa-in land, 30 rai, for sale. 

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000
30 Rai.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Jia, Mr. Song asked me about Jiu as if he suspected.

00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.000
My heart almost stopped.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
I thought he saw Tian and Jiu were close to each other like I saw.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Does your cicada orchid still not work?

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Not yet. Last night, I sneaked in to check, 

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:08.000
but it was still normal.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
If we don't rush Tian to sleep with women, 

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.000
I'm afraid that the secret will be exposed first. 

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Finally, Madam.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
The mushroom is about to pierce through the cicadas.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.000
It's almost ready. 

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Tian's wedding day is getting closer, Sir. 

00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:54.000
If we're late, we'll all be in trouble.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:58.000
My son would have lost hope of inheriting.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
You will also be oppressed by Tian.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
I can't stay calm as well. 

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
But my man is doing his job.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.000
Did he send you news?

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:15.000
Who is he? Tell me please, so I can…

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
The cicada is not dead..

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
What cicada?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
My man collected this for me the other day.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Is there something strange about cicadas at your house?

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000
My subordinate is suspicious that the cicada

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:15.000
is related to the strange orchid. 

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
The person sent to investigate about Jiu has already got some news for us. 

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:36.000
He is a seller of sugar craft near the shrine.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:38.000
He has two siblings. 

00:36:38.700 --> 00:36:40.000
His parents are all dead just like Mr. Tian said.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
But there is still a doubt. 

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
What's the matter?

00:36:48.500 --> 00:36:51.000
The house that Jiu used to live in was in the area of Mr. Ma.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
The locals have seen he went there as well.

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
This means...

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Jiu is Ma's subordinate?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Did Ma send him to hurt Tian?

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000
I'm not sure about it, Sir.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
We can investigate until here.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Mr. Ma got eyes and ears everywhere.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000
If we probe into it too much, he will be aware. 

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000
There is another one that has eyes and ears everywhere like him.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
What would you like me to do for you? Please tell me.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000
I know that you sell the secrets of Japanese soldiers.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Oh, Big Brother, don't say that.

00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:46.000
I didn't sell anyone's secrets.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Those who visit my place like to tell stories to my girls.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:54.000
And my girls like to talk. 

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.000
They just talk to one another, that's all. 

00:37:58.500 --> 00:38:00.000
It's up to you. You can call what you like. 

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I come here to day.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Because I'd like you to help me check.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:07.000
Who do you want me to check?

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:08.000
Jiu. 

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
The new worker Tian has just accepted for work. 

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
He once lived in Ma's area.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.000
You suspect if he is Ma's man?

00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.000
Don't ask too much.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
Just do what I want you to do. 

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Don't let anyone know about this.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:30.000
All right, big brother.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
I will prove you

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.000
how honest I am to you.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000
But since you are here today, 

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
do you want me to take care of you?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Don't do anything beyond my order. 

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
I let you investigate.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Just do what I tell you, okay?

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000
You can trust me. 

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
I won't dare to do anything too much.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
I'm scared.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Please. 

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Sir, Pin.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Are you coming to inquire about the progress of the wedding?

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
I'm about to let you know in the next two days.

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:10.000
But I'm busy recently, I'm really sorry.

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Father.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
I've looked at two venues, 

00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.000
but still can't decide which one.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
We should let the bride and groom choose. 

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Aunt Li. 

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000
What's the matter?

00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.000
I'd like to thank you a lot.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Uncle Song and Aunt Li have supported our family all these years.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
You've been kind to me enough

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:47.000
to let me engaged to Tian.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
But I really have to apologize.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Apologize?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.000
Apologize for what?

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
We come here today to break off the engagement.

00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:06.000
I would like to cancel the wedding of Tian and me.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.000
What is this, Sir?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Madam. 

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
Madam, Madam. 

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Madam Chan. 

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
We got big issue. 

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
I'm really sorry. 

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
I'm sorry that I cause the damage.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
But I really couldn't marry Tian.

00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:43.000
It's okay, Pin. I understand.

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.000
But I don't understand.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000
What is this, sir?

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:51.000
Everything is already prepared.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:54.000
How can you ask for a cancellation as easily as a child's play like this?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
What about the debt and the mortgage for your palace you owe me?

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Aunt Li. 

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Don't worry about that.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.000
I'm getting a lot of money from selling land.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.000
I'd like to repay the debt to buy back the palace with cash.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Selling land?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
So it's like this. 

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000
My elders have already recognized the wedding.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
I'll be embarrassed if you cancel the wedding like this.

00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:47.000
How am I going to tell these famous people?

00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:48.000
I won't accept this. 

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.000
If you don't agree, what can you do?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Build a house, you have to please the dweller.

00:43:04.300 --> 00:43:06.000
They don't love each other.

00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.000
It's right to cancel the wedding. 

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:16.000
The wedding is canceled, so does the assignment ceremony, right?

00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.000
Sir. 

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Chan, it's not something that you're going to talk about now.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Mom, let's get out, it's not our business.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000
How is it not?

00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:27.000
Yang.

00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.000
Don't tell me that Pin asked to cancel the wedding today

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
because of you two.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.000
It's not relevant, Madam. 

00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:37.000
Wait, calm down.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
It's my fault.

00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:41.000
See? I told you I wasn't involved in this. 

00:43:41.500 --> 00:43:45.000
The heaven would just want to punish you. 

00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:47.000
But you two are the ones who benefited.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
This is definitely not accidental.

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.000
Nuan, take your master away.

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:53.000
Madam, don't give up. 

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
I told you to leave.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
You must accept the truth, Madam. 

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000
This is none of your business.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.000
It's none of your business, then it's mine. 

00:44:00.500 --> 00:44:01.000
Enough!

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
All of you!

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
What's wrong with you?

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
In front of me, in front of the guests, you still dare to argue.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
I'm sorry, Sir. 

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:23.000
This is a big issue. Please go back first.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Let us consult and then we can talk later. 

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
You know about Pin selling the land right?

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
I came across this notice in Tian's room.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:50.000
I'm still confused at first, but I got it now when Pin told us a moment ago.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Yes. 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
I'm the one who helps her sell the land. 

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.000
So she will have money to buy her palace back from Mother. 

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Why did you do this?

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Tian. 

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
The elders who worked with the Five Dragons Association

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:11.000
all know that you are going to get married.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Five Dragons Association is not a small one.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.000
You can't just get married and end it like a child's play.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Your engagement and wedding is canceled.

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:29.000
It ruins our association's reputation.

00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.000
I've already told you.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I don't want to get married.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.000
but no one listens to me

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Why don't you want to get married?

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Is Pin not good?

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Who do you love? 

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.000
Who do you want to marry? Tell me!

00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Father. 

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Tian is not involved in this. I'm the one who helps Pin. 

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000
That's it, I knew it. 

00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.000
You are like your mother

00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:13.000
seeking chance to destroy Tian. 

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
You probably team up your mom to destroy his wedding, right?

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:18.000
Mother. 

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:19.000
Yang.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
It's you? Why did you do this?

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000
What else?

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000
He wants to inherit the position instead.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Destroying Tian's wedding is the only way to buy the time. 

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:35.000
Mother, Yang is not such a person.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.000
I just don't want him to be forced.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
I feel sorry for him. 

00:46:39.200 --> 00:46:40.000
Yang.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Father. / Sir. 

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.000
Father. / Sir. 

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:45.000
Father. 

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Let go of me. 

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Do you want me to get the doctor?

00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.000
No. 

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
I just felt dizzy. 

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
I'm fine. 

00:46:58.000 --> 00:46:59.000
I'll be better after sitting for a while.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Li. 

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Prepare to cancel the wedding

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
and assignment of the new head of the association.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
We have to visit the elders

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
to apologize to them in person.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Sir, this is a big deal.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Pin might hesitate like someone who has never been married.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Let me talk to her again.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000
I assure you that she'll change her mind.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Huh?

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
What? Cancel the engagement?

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:14.000
Does that mean that Mr. Tian won't have to marry Lady Pin?

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:18.000
They haven't concluded yet. Mr. Song let them go back first.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:23.000
The woman breaks off the engagement like this, what can he do?

00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.000
It must be cancelled.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
What are they going to do?

00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:31.000
The wedding will be held next month.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Right. 
560
00:49:34,000 --&gt; 00:48:37,000
I doubt that the assignment ceremony of association head has to be canceled too. 

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Mr. Tian is weird. He lost his fiancée, 

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.000
and the assignment of association head may be canceled as well.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:45.000
He's still cheerful and bright.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000
He doesn't have to get married?

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.000
How is it? Happy that much?

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Huh?

00:48:55.600 --> 00:48:57.000
Why would you be shocked?

00:48:57.500 --> 00:48:59.000
I mean Mud.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:03.000
Really weird.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
What's wrong with Lady Pin? Mr. Tian is handsome and good.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.000
Having a lot of money.

00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:11.000
She can break off the engagement easily. 

00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.000
Right?

00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:13.000
Didn't she regret it?

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Hey. 

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000
You shouldn't go in.

00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:35.000
You've been scolded. 

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Hey, bro. 

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000
It's normal for me being scolded, I'm used to it.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:44.000
And one more thing, I actually help Pin sell the land. 

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.000
How can I let my dearest brother be scolded alone?

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Actually,

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
canceling the wedding will cause you trouble

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
because the assignment of association head has to be postponed as well. 

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Do you believe me?

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
I never thought about that one bit.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
In my life.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:29.000
I never wanted that position.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
No way. 

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000
What's wrong with you?

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Even if you don't want to be one, you have to.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Can you replace me, Yang?

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
Hey. 

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000
I've taken your mischievous fiancée already. 

00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:59.000
You still want me to take the position of the association leader instead of you?

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
No, I won't.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000
I'm not like everyone else.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
I'm not like you.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Do you remember when we were kids?

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:28.000
The Five Dragons Association had another member.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Mr. Zhang.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.000
At that time, I never understood the adults why they scolded him harshly. 

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000
But now, 

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
I understand it. 

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Because…

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Mr. Zhang's lover is a man. 

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Tian. 

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
I'm just like him. 

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.000
I'm...

00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:13.800
I know that. 

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000
What do you know, Yang?

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.000
When I was a kid, 

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000
I secretly saw Madam Li hit you.

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Forbidding you from doing anything.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
I didn't understand.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
I didn't get it when I was young.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Why did she forbid you?

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Until now I'm grown up, 

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
I still don't understand.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
What do you not understand?

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Tian. 

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
I don't get it

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:34.000
how loving a man will change who you are. 

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000
For me…

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Tian. 

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Whether you love woman or man, 

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
you're still my brother anyway.

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
It's okay.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Thanks a lot. 

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000
I'm really happy

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000
that there is someone who understand and accept me the way I am today. 

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.000
It's fine. 

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:51.000
You'll be alright. 

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
I love you, sis. 

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Hey, I'm telling the truth.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000
I really love you.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
I love you too. 

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
If you love me, turn around and smile at me.

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Smile, smile. 

00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:17.000
Smile now. 

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.000
I make an effort do make garlands for the monks at my best. 

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:56.000
Tomorrow I will go to make merit.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Don't be happy too soon, Madam. They still didn't conclude yet.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
If you didn't interfere, they would have canceled the wedding already.

00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:05.000
It was you who called me.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
But I think the wedding will be canceled for sure. 

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000
The woman have said this. 

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
We can't be sure.

00:56:14.700 --> 00:56:18.000
Because Madam Li and Jia are smart. They probably won't give up easily.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
They aren't that smart.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:26.000
But they are evil for sure. 

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:34.000
I think they must be plan to do something.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Madam. 

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000
The cicada orchid is ready for producing the arousal drug.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Good, we shall use this with Tian and Pin.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Let's see if she sleeps with Tian already,

00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:01.000
will she still refuse to marry?

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000
A lot of mushrooms sprout, 

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
the arousing effect will be even more intense.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Just like when cicadas are misted up with orchid dust and breed like crazy.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Wouldn't it be dangerous?

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
If we let him eat freshly-made one, 

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:25.000
his body will become hot until the fire element in his burst. 

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000
But don't worry.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
I mixed with herbs that have a cooling effect.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:37.000
After Tian and Lady Pin consume the cicada orchids, 

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
they will feel hot, dizzy and intoxicated.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000
They will be so fascinated that they want to possess each other.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
What's this?

00:57:51.000 --> 00:58:04.000
This is the first time I see something like this. 

00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:05.000
Right, Sir. 

00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.000
It's disgusting, just seeing it gives me goosebumps.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.000
What mushrooms grow out of insects?

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Or is it the weird orchid that Big Brother is searching 

00:58:15.500 --> 00:58:16.000
to catch Li?

00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.000
The one that was used to kill Dong?

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Gui, take this to a top doctor to see if anyone knows about it, 

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:27.000
then hurry back and report me. 

00:58:27.300 --> 00:58:28.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
If it can be used as evidence that this strange insect mushroom actually kills people.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Li and Tian won't get away. 

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Are you going with Mr. Song?

00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:57.000
He goes to work. Why would you follow him?

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000
I invite her.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
There's a temple near the site I'm going to visit.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
So I let Bua go with me to make merit together.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Hurry up, Sir. It will be sunny when it's late.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Bua, please take care of Mr. Song. 

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Let's go. / Yes, Sir. 

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Madam Li order you to help mow the grass

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000
and loosen the soil from here to the back. 

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Oh, it's so wide. How long does it take to finish all of them?

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Why are you complaining?

01:00:04.500 --> 01:00:06.000
It's an order, you have to do it anyway.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000
But what is Madam going to do with this area?

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.000
Why would you ask?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
I have to ask so I'll do it right

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.000
whether to cut the grass or shovel the soil deep.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000
If it's for farming, we can manage only the top of the soil.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:23.000
But if you want to plant a big tree, we'll dig deep.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Just clear the grass and prepare the top of the soil for farming.

01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:33.000
Are you sure? Can you go back and ask Madam Li first? Then come back to us. 

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
If you have a problem, I'll tell Madam to give order to you herself. 

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:43.000
And if it isn't finished or there's not any necessary business, 

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
don't go back to the main building, understand?

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Yes. 

01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:49.000
Let's do it. 

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:19.000
How is it? You got something?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Madam ordered the workers to clear the grass in the back.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000
She said if they don't finish it, don't enter the main building.

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000
She must have planned something. 

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Otherwise, she wouldn't let the workers go elsewhere.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
What else do you get?

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.000
That's all. 

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
But before I came back, I saw Madam Li and Jia gossip about something, 

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:44.000
then walking to the old barn behind the pier.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Or did she kill some one and hide the body there?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Let's go. / Yes, Madam. 

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:06.000
I didn't see anyone here. 

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Are you sure Madam and Jia came here?

01:02:09.300 --> 01:02:10.000
Yes, Madam. 

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
They might be inside. 

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Would you like to have a look?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Nuan. 

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Madam, there's a room there.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Nuan, you've failed again. 

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Someone is here. 

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Mom, Nuan. 

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
Yang, what are you doing here?

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:33.000
I should be the one who ask you. What are you doing here?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
You're acting strangely, so I follow you here. 

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Nuan said Madam Li and Jia sneaked out here.

01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:42.000
So I had to come here as well. 

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
In case they plan to do something evil, we can I find a way to expose them. 

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000
They lured us to be locked up here. 

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I've managed to lock Madam Chan and Nuan up.

01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:36.000
Mr. Yang is there also.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Good.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.000
Then clean up and prepare this room.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:46.000
This is where I will let Tian and Pin sleep together. 

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Father.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Can't I go today?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
I don't want to get married and won't change my mind for sure. 

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:09.000
Actually, it should have ended since that day.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:13.000
Pin, even though I didn't force you, 

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
but I don't want you to from your perspective only. 

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.000
We are wrong

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.000
for letting things come to this point. 

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
You've caused damage to them. 

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Go talk to them. 

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000
If you're not getting married, we can help figure out

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
how to tell the reason for the cancellation.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Please go talk by yourself.

01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:50.000
If you let the prince talk to them by himself, we don't know what he'll say.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Perhaps instead of becoming better, things might get worse.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Why do you call Pin and Prince Pat to come here today?

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Why didn't you let them come later?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
You know that Father is not here.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
How can we wait for something like this?

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:13.000
And if the news spread…

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000
if the outsiders know about it, they'll talk to each other,

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
causing more damage.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Let's talk today. So we can conclude whether you're getting married or not. 

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Where are you going?

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:34.000
I'm seeing Yang. If they come, let someone call me. 

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Why are you going to him again?

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:40.000
What are you planning to do next?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
The more I speak, the more it hurts.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:48.000
If it wasn't because of Yang, things wouldn't be this messy.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Sit down and wait here.

01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000
We shouldn't be fooled by Madam and Jia.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.000
It's you. You still dare to speak?

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Sir. 

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Lady. 

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000
Please sit down. 

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I let you come here because I'd like to continue talking about the wedding.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
But I forgot that Mr. Song is going out for work today.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Anyway, please stay here and wait until he comes back.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
So we can finish this topic finally. 

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:57.000
Alright. 

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000
I will put the color on the teacup.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Red one

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
will be coated with a drug that makes you feel exhausted.

01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:37.000
Give this to Prince Pat.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.000
So we can buy time to let Prince Pat and Pin stay here longer.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Sir. 

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Thanks. 

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
The yellow one

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000
will be coated with cicada orchid powder. 

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000
After drinking this tea, 

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.000
The arousal drug will take full effect after two hours.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.000
It would be the right time when Mr. Song comes back. 

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000
Pin. 

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
For you. 

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Big Brother.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:07.000
I got some news about the thing you let me do. 

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Let's see if Pin will refuse the marriage again now.

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000
We can't plant anything on this kind of soil. 

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:16.000
What exactly does Madam Li want to do?

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000
We got big trouble. 

01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.000
Where is Tian now?
