00:00:18.881 --> 00:00:20.881
Take care of everything.

00:00:21.607 --> 00:00:24.085
And the scholarship will be yours.

00:00:24.413 --> 00:00:25.708
Is it Teacher Chadok?

00:00:26.916 --> 00:00:28.283
He’s forcing you to do this.

00:00:28.453 --> 00:00:29.864
No one is.

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:38.808
Why are you all here?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.251
We’re here to turn in the assignments.

00:00:52.186 --> 00:00:53.262
What were you doing just now?

00:00:54.902 --> 00:00:57.291
We accidentally knocked down these piles of books

00:00:57.436 --> 00:00:58.383
so we were helping each other put them back.

00:00:58.383 --> 00:00:59.290
Sorry, sir.

00:01:02.557 --> 00:01:04.314
Everything is back to its place.

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:06.760
May you please excuse us now?

00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:36.040
Why did you drag me out here, Akk?

00:02:36.338 --> 00:02:37.852
I must talk to that teacher.

00:02:37.852 --> 00:02:38.991
Calm yourself.

00:02:40.824 --> 00:02:42.824
Guys, is everything okay?

00:02:44.775 --> 00:02:46.143
I’ve got something to talk to Aye…

00:02:48.826 --> 00:02:49.990
I mean Ayan.

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:52.285
Right?

00:02:53.647 --> 00:02:54.425
Right.

00:02:55.817 --> 00:02:57.817
Attend class soon.

00:02:57.817 --> 00:02:59.125
Otherwise, we'll all lose points.

00:02:59.125 --> 00:02:59.851
Yeah.

00:03:07.692 --> 00:03:10.000
He must be the one behind my uncle’s death.

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:12.993
Or else how did this notebook end up in his room?

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.024
Calm down.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.894
I asked him before.

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:19.078
He said he didn’t take it.

00:03:19.078 --> 00:03:20.429
And you believed his words?

00:03:21.203 --> 00:03:23.616
When will you realize he’s dangerous, Akk?

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:27.736
Just quit being a student prefect.

00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:33.457
I can’t.

00:03:33.457 --> 00:03:34.792
Why can’t you?

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.736
If you want to, you sure as hell can.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.106
Aye, are you alright?

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.614
Are you okay?

00:04:10.681 --> 00:04:11.880
Home alone again?

00:04:17.383 --> 00:04:18.556
My mom is out working.

00:04:20.681 --> 00:04:22.803
My parents divorced when I was young.

00:04:23.693 --> 00:04:25.693
I lived with my mom and uncle growing up.

00:04:26.941 --> 00:04:28.576
You said your uncle passed away.

00:04:31.721 --> 00:04:32.319
Yeah.

00:04:34.654 --> 00:04:35.886
Want to see him?

00:04:58.272 --> 00:04:59.396
Here he is.

00:05:01.666 --> 00:05:03.374
You’re keeping him in your bedroom?

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.936
Um.

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:21.742
Can you give me a sponge bath?

00:05:22.696 --> 00:05:23.955
It’s your own body. Do it yourself.

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:25.405
Why should I do that for you?

00:05:26.818 --> 00:05:29.207
I’m nice enough to take you home.

00:05:32.726 --> 00:05:33.615
Are you all right?

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:12.890
Where do you keep your medicines?

00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:14.055
I’ll go get them.

00:07:15.778 --> 00:07:16.732
In the drawer.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.449
Amitriptyline, for relieving stress.

00:07:28.469 --> 00:07:29.837
You take these pills too?

00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:10.243
You will get better soon.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.201
Take some rest.

00:08:18.971 --> 00:08:20.582
Can you keep me company?

00:08:22.302 --> 00:08:24.472
Can you leave after I fall asleep?

00:08:29.433 --> 00:08:30.401
I’m not going anywhere.

00:08:30.717 --> 00:08:31.749
Get some sleep.

00:08:54.835 --> 00:08:56.227
When I was at your home,

00:08:58.841 --> 00:09:01.619
I loved seeing you with your parents.

00:09:03.758 --> 00:09:04.834
You’re so cute.

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:11.638
That reminded me of when my family was whole.

00:10:09.574 --> 00:10:11.161
You don’t let go of my hand.

00:10:26.752 --> 00:10:28.752
Your fever is low and you're starting to irritate me again.

00:10:29.596 --> 00:10:30.696
Shameless.

00:10:37.559 --> 00:10:38.732
Do you smell that?

00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:50.390
Mom.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.530
Hey. You guys are awake?

00:10:53.076 --> 00:10:56.535
Come. I just made us dinner.

00:10:56.535 --> 00:10:57.457
Let’s eat.

00:10:59.493 --> 00:11:00.513
This is Akk.

00:11:01.316 --> 00:11:02.040
Akk?

00:11:02.344 --> 00:11:02.943
Yes.

00:11:02.943 --> 00:11:04.344
Sounds unique.

00:11:06.055 --> 00:11:07.037
Hello.

00:11:07.256 --> 00:11:08.128
Hi.

00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:09.882
You guys must be hungry.

00:11:09.882 --> 00:11:11.026
Should we get started?

00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:12.083
Sure, Mom.

00:11:17.142 --> 00:11:18.735
Eat as much as you can.

00:11:24.514 --> 00:11:30.624
Akk, does Aye pay attention in class?

00:11:34.842 --> 00:11:36.680
I think you can guess the answer.

00:11:36.680 --> 00:11:37.443
Hey.

00:11:37.916 --> 00:11:39.016
Just be nice.

00:11:40.465 --> 00:11:42.240
Oh, let me guess.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.660
He’s a wicked student.

00:11:45.047 --> 00:11:46.080
Ma’am.

00:11:47.267 --> 00:11:48.805
Super duper.

00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:49.729
Right?

00:11:49.729 --> 00:11:50.410
Right.

00:11:50.410 --> 00:11:51.789
In class--

00:11:53.521 --> 00:11:55.302
My mom’s food is wonderful.

00:11:55.529 --> 00:11:56.848
Eat more.

00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.437
It’s great that Aye brings a friend over.

00:12:05.168 --> 00:12:06.755
I didn’t bring him here.

00:12:07.194 --> 00:12:08.756
He drove me here.

00:12:09.917 --> 00:12:10.780
Hold on.

00:12:11.753 --> 00:12:15.600
You’re sick and asked me to take you home.

00:12:22.841 --> 00:12:24.080
Oh, Akk.

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.018
Is Aye dating anyone?

00:12:27.018 --> 00:12:28.768
Is he having a crush on anyone at the moment?

00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:37.032
Oh, and are you dating anyone, Akk?

00:12:37.619 --> 00:12:38.764
No doubt.

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:40.227
Look at him.

00:12:40.788 --> 00:12:41.711
Of course, he is.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.240
Good.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.214
I think that’s good.

00:12:45.506 --> 00:12:46.337
Ma’am.

00:12:46.709 --> 00:12:48.080
No, I’m not.

00:12:49.026 --> 00:12:50.442
Don’t be nonsense.

00:12:50.442 --> 00:12:51.457
When did I ever date anyone?

00:12:51.846 --> 00:12:52.608
Me.

00:12:53.811 --> 00:12:55.000
You’re dating me.

00:13:22.648 --> 00:13:23.578
What are you doing?

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.532
What kind of dishwashing is this?

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:27.839
Can you promise me one thing, Akk?

00:13:27.839 --> 00:13:29.230
please don’t leave Aye behind.

00:13:44.278 --> 00:13:46.054
My leg still hurts.

00:13:47.732 --> 00:13:49.368
You’re harassing a sick person.

00:13:49.929 --> 00:13:51.375
You can get on my nerves.

00:13:51.375 --> 00:13:52.417
You’re fine.

00:14:00.196 --> 00:14:00.872
Hand it over.

00:14:02.987 --> 00:14:03.823
Oops!

00:14:05.266 --> 00:14:06.106
Trying to bug me?

00:14:06.431 --> 00:14:07.062
No.

00:14:11.536 --> 00:14:12.804
Are you sure you washed it?

00:14:13.431 --> 00:14:14.780
The washing bubbles are still there.

00:14:24.581 --> 00:14:25.193
Akk.

00:14:25.193 --> 00:14:25.727
Hm?

00:14:35.095 --> 00:14:35.954
What are you doing?

00:14:38.252 --> 00:14:39.393
There’s a bubble on your face.

00:14:39.928 --> 00:14:41.338
What kind of dishwashing is this?

00:14:42.113 --> 00:14:42.946
A very mindful kind.

00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:44.052
You’re messy.

00:14:44.635 --> 00:14:46.288
You’ve got bubbles on your arm too.

00:14:46.346 --> 00:14:47.562
You’re also messy.

00:14:47.688 --> 00:14:48.696
Are you picking up a fight?

00:14:51.491 --> 00:14:52.352
Are you done?

00:14:55.599 --> 00:14:57.599
I’ll be leaving now.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.260
I’ll take you.

00:15:00.134 --> 00:15:00.856
No.

00:15:01.439 --> 00:15:02.414
You’re sick.

00:15:02.658 --> 00:15:03.683
Take some rest.

00:15:03.934 --> 00:15:04.684
I can find my way home.

00:15:07.168 --> 00:15:08.621
I will take you home.

00:15:10.419 --> 00:15:11.609
It’s totally okay.

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:13.928
It’s not.

00:15:13.928 --> 00:15:17.355
You took Aye home. We can’t let you leave alone.

00:15:18.048 --> 00:15:18.831
Right?

00:15:21.848 --> 00:15:23.177
Thank you then.

00:15:23.284 --> 00:15:24.235
I’ll go get my stuff upstairs.

00:15:24.235 --> 00:15:24.928
Sure.

00:15:39.314 --> 00:15:40.663
You have such good taste.

00:15:42.249 --> 00:15:43.353
Oh, yeah.

00:15:43.658 --> 00:15:44.330
Like you.

00:15:54.283 --> 00:15:54.978
Akk,

00:15:55.507 --> 00:15:58.688
thank you for taking care of Aye.

00:15:59.807 --> 00:16:01.726
That’s fine. I just…

00:16:01.726 --> 00:16:03.533
Ever since it happened,

00:16:03.825 --> 00:16:05.378
he’s been under depression.

00:16:07.992 --> 00:16:11.334
But lately, I see his mood’s been lifted.

00:16:13.368 --> 00:16:14.808
I saw the pills he takes.

00:16:21.312 --> 00:16:24.288
He’s probably shocked by what happened.

00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:26.842
I took him to see a psychiatrist.

00:16:28.651 --> 00:16:30.082
He asked if he could transfer to a new school.

00:16:30.511 --> 00:16:32.409
I didn’t want to oppose that.

00:16:32.741 --> 00:16:34.517
I was afraid I’d lose him too.

00:16:37.384 --> 00:16:38.156
Ma’am.

00:16:40.504 --> 00:16:42.088
Aye is going to be okay.

00:16:47.655 --> 00:16:49.330
Thank you, kid.

00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:54.050
Can you promise me one thing, Akk?

00:16:55.451 --> 00:16:57.215
Whatever happens,

00:16:58.537 --> 00:16:59.667
please don’t leave Aye behind.

00:17:12.195 --> 00:17:12.930
Guys.

00:17:13.662 --> 00:17:15.395
The World Remembers is stirring things up again.

00:17:18.101 --> 00:17:19.206
Check Twitter.

00:17:24.726 --> 00:17:26.421
It’s the day to reverse the curse.

00:17:26.723 --> 00:17:29.455
Find out together who is behind it.

00:17:29.608 --> 00:17:31.608
When school isn’t a safe place,

00:17:32.062 --> 00:17:34.021
it’s time we gather outside.

00:17:34.729 --> 00:17:35.692
Outside?

00:17:39.722 --> 00:17:42.474
I think more people are joining them this time.

00:17:42.886 --> 00:17:45.171
Look how many people like and retweet it.

00:17:45.984 --> 00:17:46.655
Right.

00:17:58.769 --> 00:17:59.438
No.

00:18:00.495 --> 00:18:03.778
We can’t let those students protest outside the school.

00:18:04.807 --> 00:18:05.933
But, principal,

00:18:06.201 --> 00:18:09.177
their protest might be so damaging.

00:18:09.368 --> 00:18:10.616
Not damaging?

00:18:11.246 --> 00:18:18.065
Don't you realize how much money the alumni club is threatening to take away from us?

00:18:18.901 --> 00:18:21.430
It's due to your weak discipline enforcement.

00:18:21.983 --> 00:18:22.896
Think about it.

00:18:23.404 --> 00:18:27.419
That hashtag is trending in just a few hours.

00:18:28.402 --> 00:18:33.716
Not long after this, the media is going to make news out of it.

00:18:33.716 --> 00:18:37.441
How damaging do you think it will be to our school's reputation?

00:18:38.526 --> 00:18:39.713
Deal with it.

00:18:40.936 --> 00:18:44.624
Don’t let the media get involved.

00:18:45.245 --> 00:18:46.533
- Yes.
- Yes, ma’am.

00:18:48.796 --> 00:18:51.487
And that student prefect club of yours,

00:18:52.271 --> 00:18:54.230
if it’s no use,

00:18:54.948 --> 00:18:56.379
you better terminate it.

00:18:59.312 --> 00:19:00.234
Manage.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.290
Yes, ma’am.

00:19:03.688 --> 00:19:04.495
Chadok.

00:19:12.446 --> 00:19:16.296
Suppalo must remain Suppalo.

00:19:17.484 --> 00:19:19.484
Take care of it.

00:19:20.887 --> 00:19:25.768
I hope you don’t forget who made you who you are today.

00:19:29.146 --> 00:19:33.871
The school has directed us to keep a careful eye on student protests.

00:19:34.403 --> 00:19:38.233
Every student prefect must be extra strict on their watch.

00:19:38.761 --> 00:19:40.029
Strict how?

00:19:40.817 --> 00:19:44.810
The school has implemented a new policy that forbids students from mentioning the protest.

00:19:46.339 --> 00:19:47.932
And if there’re violators?

00:19:48.247 --> 00:19:52.280
They will be blacklisted and punished later.

00:19:52.952 --> 00:19:54.545
Blacklisting its own students.

00:19:55.928 --> 00:19:56.615
Yes.

00:19:57.845 --> 00:20:00.109
We must find a way to stop them.

00:20:00.769 --> 00:20:01.668
Otherwise,

00:20:03.051 --> 00:20:04.928
the school will let someone from outside do it.

00:20:05.528 --> 00:20:06.816
From the outside?

00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:20.922
- Take one.
- Here.

00:20:21.269 --> 00:20:25.568
Let us all grieve for the loss of the school board’s justice.
Come join us.

00:20:25.795 --> 00:20:27.531
Come join us.

00:20:28.042 --> 00:20:28.781
Hey!

00:20:30.441 --> 00:20:33.763
Please join us.

00:20:33.763 --> 00:20:35.123
See you.

00:20:35.688 --> 00:20:36.712
Should we get them now?

00:20:37.412 --> 00:20:38.306
For what?

00:20:38.570 --> 00:20:39.676
For handing out armbands?

00:20:41.198 --> 00:20:42.893
Guys, let’s mourn for it.

00:20:43.767 --> 00:20:44.567
Ready?

00:20:46.191 --> 00:20:53.568
[The World Remembers singing the funeral music.]

00:20:53.568 --> 00:20:54.166
Wat.

00:20:55.127 --> 00:20:56.568
Film them.

00:20:56.677 --> 00:20:58.209
I want to know who took the armband.

00:20:58.367 --> 00:20:59.170
Are you sure?

00:20:59.528 --> 00:21:01.128
It’s just for us to see.

00:21:01.368 --> 00:21:02.636
I will not send it to the school board.

00:21:04.481 --> 00:21:05.200
Okay.

00:21:12.728 --> 00:21:14.159
Here you go.

00:21:14.159 --> 00:21:15.709
Please come join us.

00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:16.857
Thank you.

00:21:17.079 --> 00:21:19.928
Many horrible things have happened.

00:21:20.038 --> 00:21:22.160
We've been looking for the truth behind it.

00:21:22.349 --> 00:21:24.512
However, we never catch the bad guy.

00:21:24.839 --> 00:21:27.571
Because there are never enough serious investigations.

00:21:27.889 --> 00:21:29.523
You know why?

00:21:29.681 --> 00:21:31.681
Why?

00:21:31.681 --> 00:21:34.174
Because the school board lacks integrity.

00:21:34.524 --> 00:21:36.888
They never really care to find the one responsible.

00:21:36.888 --> 00:21:37.929
True.

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:39.563
Let’s see.

00:21:39.563 --> 00:21:42.391
Is any of you here done with the Suppalo curse?

00:21:42.391 --> 00:21:44.295
If you are, join us.

00:21:44.295 --> 00:21:46.118
We have an appointment, guys.

00:21:46.118 --> 00:21:47.742
Where?

00:21:47.742 --> 00:21:49.688
At the Suppalo Curse Reverse Day.

00:21:49.688 --> 00:21:51.826
Come and show them our power.

00:21:51.826 --> 00:21:53.441
That’s awesome, Nian.

00:21:53.533 --> 00:21:57.968
Those who have the armband, wear it.

00:21:58.361 --> 00:22:00.890
If you haven’t got one, come and get it here.

00:22:00.890 --> 00:22:02.701
Join us, everyone.

00:22:03.762 --> 00:22:05.294
Thank you.

00:22:23.178 --> 00:22:26.439
Nian!

00:22:26.439 --> 00:22:28.217
Nian!
[You freaking misfits, you have it coming.]

00:22:31.577 --> 00:22:32.764
Damn.

00:22:32.764 --> 00:22:33.532
Will we be cursed too?

00:22:36.421 --> 00:22:37.383
Nian!

00:22:37.383 --> 00:22:38.828
Are you all right?

00:22:38.828 --> 00:22:39.929
Nian.

00:22:40.172 --> 00:22:41.087
Are you okay?

00:22:43.019 --> 00:22:43.860
Nong.

00:22:44.227 --> 00:22:45.354
What the heck is this?

00:22:45.883 --> 00:22:46.471
Yes.

00:22:46.782 --> 00:22:47.745
So dramatic.

00:22:52.358 --> 00:22:53.382
Was it you?

00:22:53.528 --> 00:22:55.528
Do you really think I want my school to look bad?

00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:56.983
Do you like it?

00:22:58.564 --> 00:23:01.113
If he wants to talk to me, he should do it face-to-face.

00:23:13.546 --> 00:23:15.546
[They should have protested a long time ago.]

00:23:15.546 --> 00:23:17.119
[The curse will be back because of them.]

00:23:17.119 --> 00:23:19.833
[They should just stop protesting.]
[Suppalo will not endure this anymore.]

00:23:19.833 --> 00:23:23.606
[It won’t kill them to just stay silent.]

00:23:32.959 --> 00:23:41.076
[ECLIPSE1234: Will you stop or not?]

00:23:56.731 --> 00:23:57.403
Akk.

00:24:02.758 --> 00:24:03.715
Was it you?

00:24:04.758 --> 00:24:05.750
What the hell?

00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:10.898
You did it.

00:24:11.623 --> 00:24:14.158
This fabric banner and this threat post.

00:24:15.516 --> 00:24:17.410
Are you this obsessed with the Suppalo curse?

00:24:18.056 --> 00:24:19.047
Listen to me.

00:24:19.632 --> 00:24:22.353
Thousands of people are tweeting about the fabric banner.

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.590
Do you really think I want my school to look bad?

00:24:26.443 --> 00:24:27.599
That’s not my way.

00:24:36.221 --> 00:24:37.665
If not you, then who?

00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.786
Must be someone in this school.

00:24:46.677 --> 00:24:48.924
But we can’t trace the IP address on Twitter, can we?

00:24:50.469 --> 00:24:52.469
That’s why we need to create a fake link.

00:24:52.554 --> 00:24:56.552
To make them click through. We will get the IP address from there.

00:24:57.561 --> 00:24:59.005
Who would fall for that?

00:24:59.302 --> 00:25:00.748
Your trap sucks.

00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:02.105
See this.

00:25:06.444 --> 00:25:08.073
[Magical! Do this and all your illness will be gone!]

00:25:08.073 --> 00:25:08.958
So old.

00:25:10.715 --> 00:25:13.683
If Teacher Chadok sees this, he will surely fall for it.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.056
He doesn’t look like someone who can resist this.

00:25:16.574 --> 00:25:18.574
Say we got the IP address. Then what?

00:25:18.982 --> 00:25:21.690
Lots of people know how to hide or sham it.

00:25:21.867 --> 00:25:25.721
If it’s really Chadok, he wouldn’t know how to do that.

00:25:26.850 --> 00:25:27.747
Trust me.

00:25:41.893 --> 00:25:43.646
Can you be less obvious about that?

00:25:44.128 --> 00:25:45.613
If teachers pass by, it will be taken.

00:25:46.816 --> 00:25:48.033
It’s my asset.

00:25:48.626 --> 00:25:50.667
Whoever takes it will face embezzlement charges.

00:25:51.015 --> 00:25:53.200
3 years imprisonment tops.

00:25:53.323 --> 00:25:54.870
Or a THB6,000 fine.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.596
Or both.

00:25:57.255 --> 00:25:57.950
Got it?

00:26:00.069 --> 00:26:00.756
Yes.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:06.709
Aye.

00:26:07.091 --> 00:26:08.205
We’ve got one click.

00:26:09.285 --> 00:26:09.843
That’s me.

00:26:12.006 --> 00:26:13.613
I’m checking if it works.

00:26:17.581 --> 00:26:19.581
You’re a man of violence.

00:26:20.791 --> 00:26:21.784
An authoritarian.

00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:23.850
You’ll pay for that.

00:26:25.572 --> 00:26:27.450
Why are you turning away? Help me here.

00:26:28.908 --> 00:26:29.872
Do you want to be close to me?

00:26:31.170 --> 00:26:32.206
Turn away then.

00:26:48.779 --> 00:26:49.646
There’s something over your mouth.

00:27:01.145 --> 00:27:02.170
Should we take turns now?

00:27:04.456 --> 00:27:05.184
No.

00:27:09.233 --> 00:27:10.945
This doesn’t look like my school at all.

00:27:11.757 --> 00:27:13.160
It’s so messed up.

00:27:23.333 --> 00:27:23.932
Akk.

00:27:25.417 --> 00:27:28.653
Who else is a school fanatic apart from you and your father Chadok?

00:27:29.298 --> 00:27:32.554
Who else is a Suppalo cult fanatic?

00:27:42.219 --> 00:27:42.947
Mo.

00:27:43.853 --> 00:27:44.734
Yeah.

00:27:49.925 --> 00:27:51.616
Were you behind that fabric threat banner?

00:27:52.972 --> 00:27:53.718
I wasn’t.

00:27:54.748 --> 00:27:56.084
Then who?

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.539
I thought it was you at first.

00:28:01.896 --> 00:28:05.214
I know you’re the one who burned that gang’s leaflets.

00:28:16.104 --> 00:28:17.671
I just wanted to help you.

00:28:19.925 --> 00:28:22.708
It was an easy job. It didn’t hurt anyone.

00:28:23.572 --> 00:28:26.952
But I’ve not done anything lately.

00:28:27.749 --> 00:28:28.560
Mo.

00:28:30.290 --> 00:28:33.456
If you’re planning on doing something shitty, don’t.

00:28:33.991 --> 00:28:34.852
Please.

00:28:38.654 --> 00:28:39.314
Akk.

00:28:40.859 --> 00:28:43.476
Do you realize you’ve changed?

00:28:45.492 --> 00:28:46.396
I haven’t changed.

00:28:46.705 --> 00:28:47.513
You’re wrong.

00:28:48.185 --> 00:28:49.341
Seriously.

00:28:50.471 --> 00:28:52.090
Are you still on the Suppalo side?

00:29:00.663 --> 00:29:03.404
What will the student prefects do about the protest?

00:29:04.004 --> 00:29:06.148
We’re told to collect the names of those who are joining.

00:29:07.674 --> 00:29:09.592
What if I am?

00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:10.970
Will my name be taken too?

00:29:13.153 --> 00:29:13.943
Heck yes.

00:29:14.761 --> 00:29:15.960
Why are you joining them anyway?

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.531
You’re the head of the class.

00:29:18.256 --> 00:29:21.142
Besides, don’t associate with those guys.

00:29:23.492 --> 00:29:28.293
The head of the class whose duties are only to welcome the teachers and turn in assignments?

00:29:29.529 --> 00:29:30.445
Not just that.

00:29:31.083 --> 00:29:32.764
You give me wake-up calls.

00:29:33.031 --> 00:29:35.031
You cover for me when I’m late.

00:29:35.382 --> 00:29:38.268
More importantly, you’re my report partner.

00:29:39.115 --> 00:29:40.332
Even though most of the work is done by you.

00:29:45.872 --> 00:29:48.057
I like the report video we shot at Akk’s house.

00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:51.985
Do you like it?

00:29:58.954 --> 00:29:59.610
Yeah.

00:30:00.763 --> 00:30:01.593
I do.

00:30:14.128 --> 00:30:16.313
Someone sent me a friend request on Facebook.

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.115
Named Bruce Wayne.

00:30:19.474 --> 00:30:20.243
Yeah?

00:30:20.676 --> 00:30:21.412
Yes.

00:30:22.508 --> 00:30:25.867
I think I have a good feeling for him.

00:30:28.113 --> 00:30:28.967
Are you nuts?

00:30:29.853 --> 00:30:31.802
You have a good feeling for someone you haven’t met.

00:30:33.702 --> 00:30:35.290
I’m surprised by that too.

00:30:35.861 --> 00:30:38.891
But I want to see him in person.

00:30:42.659 --> 00:30:44.659
What if he’s a bad guy who wants to deceive you?

00:30:45.483 --> 00:30:46.353
Don’t think so.

00:30:47.383 --> 00:30:49.357
I think I will call him out.

00:30:50.398 --> 00:30:53.016
If he wants to talk to me, he should do it face-to-face.

00:30:53.390 --> 00:30:54.281
Do you agree?

00:30:58.647 --> 00:30:59.426
Yeah.

00:31:11.799 --> 00:31:15.426
If I go to see him, Thua will know how I feel about him.

00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:16.920
So?

00:31:17.455 --> 00:31:18.963
Are you afraid he will reject you?

00:31:19.635 --> 00:31:21.429
Why would I be afraid he’d reject me?

00:31:21.644 --> 00:31:23.210
I’m the girls’ favorite.

00:31:24.971 --> 00:31:26.477
But this is Thua.

00:31:27.091 --> 00:31:28.514
But I’m not ready.

00:31:29.244 --> 00:31:30.172
Why?

00:31:30.770 --> 00:31:32.707
Are you afraid your cool looks will be ruined?

00:31:33.734 --> 00:31:34.725
Heck no.

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.475
I just don’t really know what to do.

00:31:41.467 --> 00:31:43.137
How do you feel about him?

00:31:45.288 --> 00:31:46.355
You just like him.

00:31:47.288 --> 00:31:48.427
Or it’s more than that?

00:31:50.858 --> 00:31:52.240
I have no clue how I feel.

00:31:57.091 --> 00:31:58.967
But when he’s out of sight,

00:32:01.816 --> 00:32:03.033
I’m so worried about him.

00:32:05.650 --> 00:32:07.320
When you spend time with him,

00:32:08.417 --> 00:32:10.829
do you feel so happy that you forget all the sadness?

00:32:22.264 --> 00:32:23.174
I think…

00:32:25.254 --> 00:32:26.344
that’s love.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.550
I like when you smile widely.

00:32:43.161 --> 00:32:43.925
You’re cute.

00:33:13.427 --> 00:33:14.735
Took you long enough.

00:33:16.944 --> 00:33:18.109
Don’t act like you’re tired.

00:33:18.747 --> 00:33:20.747
You said you’d track down the intervenor behind that incident.

00:33:23.599 --> 00:33:24.716
Get up.

00:33:29.366 --> 00:33:31.629
All you think about is work?

00:33:32.514 --> 00:33:34.633
Don’t you want any good moments with me at all?

00:33:35.478 --> 00:33:36.714
What moments are you talking about?

00:33:36.714 --> 00:33:40.863
People dating always create their good moments together.

00:33:42.645 --> 00:33:43.645
Who’s dating you?

00:33:44.194 --> 00:33:45.385
Don’t be a wisecracker.

00:33:46.721 --> 00:33:47.560
So?

00:33:48.882 --> 00:33:50.043
Did the fish take the bait yet?

00:33:51.895 --> 00:33:52.719
Not yet.

00:33:53.244 --> 00:33:55.280
This fish is being cautious.

00:33:55.870 --> 00:33:56.996
So witty.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:33:58.753
Who is he?

00:34:00.264 --> 00:34:01.524
What does this person really want?

00:34:02.591 --> 00:34:03.731
I have no idea.

00:34:05.326 --> 00:34:06.195
Have dinner with me.

00:34:06.195 --> 00:34:07.780
What? I’m not hungry.

00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.794
Well, I am.

00:34:08.794 --> 00:34:09.582
Eat with me.

00:34:10.724 --> 00:34:11.474
No.

00:34:11.474 --> 00:34:12.318
Come on.

00:34:25.912 --> 00:34:28.882
You’re eating with your boyfriend but looking so distant.

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:31.346
Are you cheating on me?

00:34:33.638 --> 00:34:34.775
Are you?

00:34:38.738 --> 00:34:40.619
I’m done arguing with you.

00:34:40.948 --> 00:34:42.638
Eat and go home.

00:34:42.638 --> 00:34:43.515
See?

00:34:44.116 --> 00:34:45.806
You’re shooing me away.

00:34:45.806 --> 00:34:46.847
You’re cheating on me for sure.

00:34:47.357 --> 00:34:49.667
You’re so obsessed with something nonsense.

00:34:51.136 --> 00:34:52.754
Mr. Nice Mouth has returned.

00:34:53.538 --> 00:34:54.774
That’s a relief.

00:34:54.774 --> 00:34:55.706
What are you talking about?

00:34:55.706 --> 00:34:59.825
I see you’re so concerned about the intervenor that you became quiet.

00:35:01.115 --> 00:35:02.781
So I tried to get myself yelled at.

00:35:04.327 --> 00:35:05.281
I’m smart, right?

00:35:06.069 --> 00:35:06.900
Yeah?

00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:08.284
Should I thank you?

00:35:08.410 --> 00:35:09.284
Hell yeah.

00:35:09.571 --> 00:35:13.324
When people do something nice to you, you must thank them.

00:35:14.071 --> 00:35:14.993
Got it?

00:35:15.232 --> 00:35:16.310
Sure.

00:35:17.094 --> 00:35:18.010
Of course.

00:35:18.882 --> 00:35:19.966
Certainly.

00:35:22.987 --> 00:35:24.207
You like wasabi?

00:35:24.494 --> 00:35:25.847
Come here.

00:35:25.847 --> 00:35:27.045
Yum.

00:35:27.045 --> 00:35:28.010
Open your mouth.

00:35:28.416 --> 00:35:30.526
Do it. A nice guy must be thanked.

00:35:30.526 --> 00:35:31.090
Open it.

00:35:31.090 --> 00:35:31.590
No.

00:35:31.590 --> 00:35:32.146
Do it.

00:35:32.963 --> 00:35:36.181
Yum.

00:35:38.462 --> 00:35:39.307
Thank you.

00:35:47.975 --> 00:35:48.748
Thank you.

00:35:48.748 --> 00:35:49.592
You’re welcome.

00:35:53.039 --> 00:35:53.870
Akk.

00:35:54.801 --> 00:35:56.137
You’re trying to get me.

00:35:56.137 --> 00:35:56.964
No.

00:36:08.089 --> 00:36:08.938
Why are you smiling?

00:36:10.992 --> 00:36:11.737
Nothing.

00:36:13.187 --> 00:36:17.097
I just like it when I get to eat with you like this.

00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:25.250
I usually eat alone.

00:36:27.983 --> 00:36:29.291
The food doesn’t taste as good as it does now.

00:36:40.699 --> 00:36:42.532
You just keep rambling.

00:36:44.447 --> 00:36:45.244
Just eat.

00:36:48.611 --> 00:36:49.814
You eat this too.

00:37:00.548 --> 00:37:01.999
Are you joining the protest?

00:37:05.522 --> 00:37:06.517
Yes.

00:37:06.899 --> 00:37:08.716
The school handles it so poorly.

00:37:09.028 --> 00:37:10.383
I think I should do something.

00:37:15.058 --> 00:37:16.366
But it’s not safe.

00:37:22.163 --> 00:37:23.566
Do you believe in the curse?

00:37:32.815 --> 00:37:34.815
Do you want to see me at the protest?

00:37:39.605 --> 00:37:41.414
I’ll let you know later.

00:37:56.953 --> 00:37:58.189
Are you joining?

00:37:58.189 --> 00:37:58.884
I am.

00:37:58.884 --> 00:38:00.937
But we should get to class first. Come on.

00:38:07.805 --> 00:38:09.327
Are you also joining?

00:38:12.187 --> 00:38:16.097
I want to see for myself if the Suppalo curse is really potent.

00:38:20.483 --> 00:38:23.882
Every place has its tale invented to scare people.

00:38:25.702 --> 00:38:27.511
It’s the method used to rule people.

00:38:28.878 --> 00:38:30.759
And who invented it?

00:38:31.804 --> 00:38:32.784
I don’t know.

00:38:34.217 --> 00:38:40.753
What I do is the tale inventor must get the benefit from it.

00:38:44.865 --> 00:38:45.698
I’m taking off.

00:38:45.913 --> 00:38:46.770
Um.

00:38:57.275 --> 00:39:00.350
I don’t know what to tell yet.

00:39:01.885 --> 00:39:05.819
Filmmakers always start with something they want to tell.

00:39:06.485 --> 00:39:09.440
There are so many things in my head right now.

00:39:09.657 --> 00:39:12.660
I just don’t know how to convey them.

00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:20.898
How about we start with favorite movies, books, news, or stories of people close to you?

00:39:21.002 --> 00:39:24.005
What or who is your inspiration?

00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.499
I like a screenplay that someone wrote.

00:39:29.776 --> 00:39:31.203
His name is Nut.

00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:33.054
He writes indie film screenplays.

00:39:33.979 --> 00:39:35.263
What's his work like?

00:39:36.212 --> 00:39:41.818
He likes to play around with the grey area between tales and reality.

00:39:42.636 --> 00:39:44.636
Interesting.

00:39:44.709 --> 00:39:46.446
You can start from there.

00:39:47.211 --> 00:39:47.976
Sure.

00:39:48.882 --> 00:39:50.882
And what’s the story you want to tell?

00:39:52.563 --> 00:39:56.497
I’m interested in what’s happening in our school.

00:39:58.046 --> 00:40:01.383
The protest and the Suppalo curse.

00:40:20.165 --> 00:40:23.383
The School Foundation Day is approaching in a few days.

00:40:23.383 --> 00:40:25.651
Take care of the orderliness.

00:40:27.516 --> 00:40:31.617
Every student prefect must be extra strict on their watch.

00:40:31.617 --> 00:40:35.609
The school has implemented a new policy that forbids students from mentioning the protest.

00:40:36.062 --> 00:40:38.882
[You freaking misfits, you have it coming.]

00:40:38.882 --> 00:40:41.114
The school board lacks integrity.

00:41:03.883 --> 00:41:04.567
Don’t.

00:41:04.567 --> 00:41:05.529
I can help myself.

00:41:05.911 --> 00:41:07.650
No one cares what we do.

00:41:08.271 --> 00:41:09.793
It’s just a friend helping a friend up.

00:41:10.672 --> 00:41:11.652
You’re overthinking it.

00:41:11.867 --> 00:41:12.577
Come on.

00:41:20.125 --> 00:41:20.896
Hey!

00:41:20.896 --> 00:41:22.006
Aye!

00:41:23.696 --> 00:41:24.860
What the heck are you doing?

00:41:25.834 --> 00:41:27.524
I haven’t got to swim yet.

00:41:27.996 --> 00:41:29.017
Swim with me.

00:41:34.650 --> 00:41:35.743
Hey!

00:41:46.106 --> 00:41:47.117
What are you smiling at?

00:41:48.106 --> 00:41:49.262
I smile because you smile.

00:41:54.593 --> 00:41:56.593
I like when you smile widely.

00:41:57.384 --> 00:41:58.384
You’re cute.

00:41:58.882 --> 00:42:00.264
I’m not cute.

00:42:00.781 --> 00:42:02.041
I’m solemn.

00:42:02.250 --> 00:42:04.250
The president of the prefect club, you know?

00:42:05.212 --> 00:42:07.451
Are you opposed to your own cuteness?

00:42:08.461 --> 00:42:10.342
I am not cute.

00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:11.765
You wanna fight me?

00:42:11.956 --> 00:42:12.981
You’re cute.

00:42:13.117 --> 00:42:14.639
Picking up a fight, huh?

00:42:15.122 --> 00:42:16.191
Get this.

00:42:19.290 --> 00:42:20.305
Am I still cute?

00:42:20.806 --> 00:42:21.504
You are.

00:42:22.542 --> 00:42:24.255
Shut up, Shortstop.

00:42:24.255 --> 00:42:25.888
I’m not following your order, Big Foot.

00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.783
We’re in school.

00:43:23.883 --> 00:43:26.170
I’ve been wearing an inappropriate uniform.

00:43:26.643 --> 00:43:28.643
Why am I not affected by the curse yet?

00:43:28.882 --> 00:43:29.979
Watch it.

00:43:30.337 --> 00:43:31.144
Why?

00:43:31.354 --> 00:43:32.504
What are you gonna do to me?

00:43:33.602 --> 00:43:34.667
Like you’re so scary.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:36.986
When will you stop teasing me, Shortstop?

00:43:36.986 --> 00:43:37.788
I will never stop.

00:43:39.531 --> 00:43:40.381
Aye.

00:43:47.058 --> 00:43:48.771
Don’t look at anyone else like this.

00:43:50.136 --> 00:43:51.014
I’m jealous.

00:44:09.976 --> 00:44:11.212
Who’s screaming?

00:44:17.748 --> 00:44:18.530
Nian.

00:44:25.701 --> 00:44:28.035

Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

00:44:35.783 --> 00:44:37.315
Do you see what’s happening?

00:44:37.315 --> 00:44:39.736
Are you going to let the school do this to us?

00:44:39.736 --> 00:44:40.921
You’re students.

00:44:40.921 --> 00:44:42.625
Your duty is to study.

00:44:42.625 --> 00:44:44.770
Why is growing up so tough?

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:46.970
Sometimes, I just don’t want tomorrow to come.

00:44:46.970 --> 00:44:50.079
Until tomorrow comes, let me hold your hand like this.

00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:51.569
Should we go out?

00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:55.745
I’m glad it’s you.

00:44:57.381 --> 00:44:58.641
Kiss my cheek.

00:44:58.883 --> 00:45:01.074
I want a good moment this morning.
