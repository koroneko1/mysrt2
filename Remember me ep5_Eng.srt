1
00:00:01,297 --> 00:00:04,316
Sometimes loneliness makes us depressed,

2
00:00:04,866 --> 00:00:09,322
happy, strong, and weak.

3
00:00:09,323 --> 00:00:10,267
“Loneliness may weaken one’s heart or make it be strong when he left”.

4
00:00:10,768 --> 00:00:12,768
Sometimes we yield to the heart.

5
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:17,059
But if one day he's gone,

6
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:19,792
we need to learn to live by ourselves.

7
00:00:23,241 --> 00:00:23,741
Oh.

8
00:00:25,256 --> 00:00:25,959
Hello.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:27,974
Hi.

10
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:31,880
How could you get up here?

11
00:00:32,602 --> 00:00:34,741
I just... asked the security guard.

12
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:36,638
Really?

13
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:39,350
Then,

14
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:40,888
How do you know my room number?

15
00:00:42,018 --> 00:00:45,269
I asked if he know who came from Chachoengsao.

16
00:00:45,481 --> 00:00:47,018
And he said you're in this room.

17
00:00:47,497 --> 00:00:48,107
Correct?

18
00:00:49,003 --> 00:00:49,503
Yeah.

19
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:51,677
Have you eaten yet, Korn?

20
00:00:51,872 --> 00:00:53,872
Do you want to eat something
before the afternoon class?

21
00:00:53,873 --> 00:00:54,715
I'm so hungry.

22
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,962
If you're not done preparing yourself,
I can wait inside.

23
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:58,592
No, it's alright

24
00:00:58,593 --> 00:01:00,593
I'm done. Just give me a second.

25
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:07,533
You don't have to hurry.

26
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:08,900
Wait.

27
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:18,771
Let's eat something.

28
00:01:18,772 --> 00:01:19,567
Now?

29
00:01:19,568 --> 00:01:20,456
Yep.

Hello, grandpa.

55
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:45,680
How are you doing?

56
00:03:46,148 --> 00:03:48,148
Lately? I'm doing great.

57
00:03:49,001 --> 00:03:50,630
But I have to study quite hard.

58
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,558
Can I call you back tonight? I'm late now.

59
00:03:54,195 --> 00:03:56,751
Tell everyone I miss them all, bye.

60
00:04:09,468 --> 00:04:11,468
Hey, don't you have classes today, Chompu?

61
00:04:17,466 --> 00:04:19,095
I only have the afternoon classes today.

62
00:04:19,096 --> 00:04:20,262
How about you, Nuck-Nan?

63
00:04:20,263 --> 00:04:23,421
If I remember correctly,
you have classes today, right?

64
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,768
You memorize details about me so well.

65
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:31,491
Is it because you have feelings for me?

66
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,914
You're imagining things.

67
00:04:47,102 --> 00:04:48,592
Should I answer your call?

68
00:04:50,899 --> 00:04:52,899
Sorry, my hand slipped.

69
00:04:59,451 --> 00:05:02,656
Lol, you're too good at flirting.

70
00:05:05,046 --> 00:05:06,166
Hahaha.

71
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,788
We've been talking for weeks,
but you never ask me about the research.

72
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:18,290
Have you forgotten about it?

73
00:05:25,243 --> 00:05:26,733
The professor is staring at me, Chompu.

74
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:30,000
Let me pretend to study.
I'll text you again at night.

75
00:05:30,001 --> 00:05:32,001
Let's make a video call this time.

76
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,408
Changing the subject, huh?

77
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:38,899
I'll do that if I'm free.

78
00:05:53,714 --> 00:05:55,992
Alright, students. That's it for today.

79
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:57,993
Let's meet again in the next class.

80
00:06:12,647 --> 00:06:13,489
Hm.

81
00:06:19,783 --> 00:06:20,625
Hey.

82
00:06:21,382 --> 00:06:22,502
What should we do tonight?

83
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:28,600
Wanna hang out and dance with us?

84
00:06:28,787 --> 00:06:29,721
Not tonight.

85
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:33,034
Why? What happened?

86
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:36,640
Yeah, you were not going anywhere these past few days.

87
00:06:36,641 --> 00:06:38,085
It's weird.

88
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,314
I just...

89
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:48,277
Just what?

90
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,651
I'm tired of going out.

91
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:59,459
Is that true? I bet it's because of a girl.

92
00:07:00,477 --> 00:07:01,880
What? Do I know her?

93
00:07:02,076 --> 00:07:04,076
Hey! What girl? It's not that

94
00:07:04,077 --> 00:07:05,428
I'm sure of it!

95
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:06,370
No.

96
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:09,126
Let's go eat. I'm hungry.

97
00:07:09,127 --> 00:07:10,525
Booo.

98
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,003
I'm certain it's a girl.

99
00:07:19,004 --> 00:07:20,000
Let's find out who it is.

100
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:31,800
Can I eat fish?

101
00:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,384
Golf? Are you going to eat?

102
00:07:39,385 --> 00:07:40,227
Yes.

103
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:43,929
Do you want fish?

104
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,447
Yeah.

105
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:45,600
Whoaa.

106
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:48,386
Is it good like the pickled fish in our province?

107
00:07:51,122 --> 00:07:53,122
How could it be that good?

108
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:54,874
That's true.

109
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:06,460
Look.

110
00:08:07,472 --> 00:08:09,472
Now, there's a new constitution for people.

111
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:16,133
This changes nothing.

112
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:18,288
They will revise it anyway.

113
00:08:20,001 --> 00:08:22,001
It's better than having no hope at all.

114
00:08:30,248 --> 00:08:30,858
Golf.

115
00:08:30,859 --> 00:08:31,562
Huh?

116
00:08:32,491 --> 00:08:33,657
About our assignment...

117
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:36,182
Do you wanna do it at the faculty building
at night like always?

118
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:39,148
I think today...

119
00:08:40,322 --> 00:08:41,534
we should work in your room.

120
00:08:43,768 --> 00:08:45,397
I want a change of mood.

121
00:08:47,785 --> 00:08:48,488
Um.

122
00:08:50,622 --> 00:08:51,325
Sure.

123
00:08:52,869 --> 00:08:53,757
My room?

124
00:08:54,887 --> 00:08:56,887
Yeah, you room. What else?

125
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,000
So I can look at something new.

126
00:09:04,852 --> 00:09:07,593
Hurry up. We have to go to our class

127
00:09:07,594 --> 00:09:08,575
I don't want to be late.

128
00:10:40,383 --> 00:10:42,383
The professor gave us lots of homework today.

129
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:45,409
We just met only a few times,

130
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,410
but he gave us a month load of work.

131
00:10:49,684 --> 00:10:51,684
Well. Just do it.

132
00:10:55,262 --> 00:10:56,196
It's hard.

133
00:10:58,756 --> 00:10:59,360
Korn.

134
00:11:00,216 --> 00:11:01,660
Can I use your internet?

135
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,059
I want to search for something.

136
00:11:04,465 --> 00:11:05,214
Go ahead.

137
00:11:07,599 --> 00:11:10,201
You didn't leave any work unfinished, right?

138
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:13,619
I'm gonna try doing question 8.

139
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:21,486
Hey.

140
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,919
Wait.

141
00:11:26,514 --> 00:11:28,514
- Are you okay?
- Just a moment.

142
00:12:01,652 --> 00:12:02,355
Ehh.

143
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,944
You can continue.

144
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:11,501
Here is the internet.

145
00:12:11,502 --> 00:12:12,297
Right here.

146
00:12:13,088 --> 00:12:13,883
This one.

147
00:12:14,878 --> 00:12:15,998
Here.

148
00:12:17,479 --> 00:12:20,313
Okay. So I can use it now?

149
00:12:23,468 --> 00:12:24,171
Yes.

150
00:12:44,235 --> 00:12:48,830

151
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,682

153
00:13:19,478 --> 00:13:21,478
It's connected. Champ!

154
00:13:21,696 --> 00:13:23,047
Hehe.

155
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:27,093
Hi, everyone.

156
00:13:30,641 --> 00:13:33,336
How is it, my grandson?
Does studying make you tired?

157
00:13:37,213 --> 00:13:38,472
I'm fine.

158
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,536
But...

159
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:44,127
It's like what sis told me... it's a lot.

160
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,913
Speaking of sis...

161
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,309
Why are you there?

162
00:13:50,297 --> 00:13:52,080
You're still not graduated, aren't you?

163
00:13:52,428 --> 00:13:55,216
No. I'm here for the internship.

164
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:57,918
Internship?

165
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:02,309
Is there any place for that near our house?

166
00:14:03,298 --> 00:14:04,047
Cool, right?

167
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:07,146
Well.

168
00:14:07,755 --> 00:14:11,330
Is it me or Champ looks thinner these days?

169
00:14:12,138 --> 00:14:13,443
A little bit.

170
00:14:14,571 --> 00:14:15,181
Yeah.

171
00:14:16,961 --> 00:14:18,312
I rarely have time to eat.

172
00:14:18,882 --> 00:14:19,399
Because.

173
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,666
I have to wake up and do everything by myself.

174
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:24,062
It's...

175
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:25,597
That's it.

176
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,754
I think I'm doing good.

177
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:29,142
Hahaha.

178
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,694
Good boy.

179
00:14:31,184 --> 00:14:32,026
By the way.

180
00:14:32,027 --> 00:14:35,741
Lucky is healthy, don't worry about it.

181
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:39,688
But it waits for you in front of our house every day.

182
00:14:39,689 --> 00:14:40,438
It misses you.

183
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:41,095
Where is it?

184
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:44,214
Lucky! Stop it!

185
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:46,910
Lucky! No!

186
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,221
Are you sick?

187
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:00,847
It's just a normal cough.

188
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:06,419
Grandpa.

189
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:09,454
You're old. Please take a good care of yourself.

190
00:15:10,001 --> 00:15:12,001
Avoid fried foods.

191
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:14,546
Champ.

192
00:15:16,181 --> 00:15:17,810
Living there,

193
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:21,209
you must be exhausted.

194
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:25,124
All of us

195
00:15:26,707 --> 00:15:29,680
are always by your side.

196
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:33,080
If you're tired,

197
00:15:33,757 --> 00:15:38,491
you can come home and relax at any time.

198
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,854
Champ.

199
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:48,805
No matter what happens,

200
00:15:49,011 --> 00:15:51,984
you have to be strong, got it?

201
00:15:53,921 --> 00:15:56,987
And no matter where I am,

202
00:15:58,802 --> 00:16:03,200
I'll always cheer you up.

203
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:10,952
What's that?

204
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:13,983
You make me get emotional.

205
00:16:17,303 --> 00:16:18,423
I have to go.

206
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,041
There're a lot of assignments
I have to submit tomorrow.

207
00:16:23,657 --> 00:16:24,591
Then

208
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:27,085
I'll end the call. Let's talk again next time.

209
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:04,996
[The pictures of you still look the same]

210
00:17:06,751 --> 00:17:13,430
[But we can't go back again]

211
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:19,651
[To the time when we were close]

212
00:17:37,835 --> 00:17:43,866
[If we could turn back time]

213
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:50,000
[I would love to go through everything with you again]

214
00:17:52,281 --> 00:17:58,312
[Those familiar words]

215
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:04,389
[I can still remember them]

216
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:11,267
Hello.

217
00:19:18,128 --> 00:19:19,016
How is it?

218
00:19:19,356 --> 00:19:20,800
Do I look the same as my photo?

219
00:19:21,717 --> 00:19:23,161
You're pretty, Chompu.

220
00:19:23,408 --> 00:19:24,852
You're exaggerating.

221
00:19:28,944 --> 00:19:30,203
Hey, Nuck-Nan.

222
00:19:30,204 --> 00:19:32,204
So what I want to ask is...

223
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:32,769
Nuck-Nan.

224
00:19:34,638 --> 00:19:35,294
Nuck-Nan!

225
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:36,365
Hey!

226
00:19:36,751 --> 00:19:37,407
What?

227
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:38,729
Who is it?

228
00:19:39,461 --> 00:19:41,461
You keep smiling all week.

229
00:19:41,957 --> 00:19:43,169
Is it your new girl?

230
00:19:46,759 --> 00:19:47,647
Fuxk you.

231
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:50,836
Let me talk to my brother first.

232
00:19:50,837 --> 00:19:52,837
Let's talk again next time, bye.

233
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,858
Do you really have to scold me?

234
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:00,338
Just you wait.

235
00:20:00,802 --> 00:20:03,265
There's a law for Computer-related crime 2007

236
00:20:03,695 --> 00:20:06,112
I'll sue you. Just wait and see.

237
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,338
You once cursed me in Hi5.

238
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:10,539
That's the end of you.

239
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:12,605
You're going to use law against me?

240
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:13,911
How dare you?

241
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:16,593
Take care of yourself first.

242
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,798
How many times did you stand Name up?

243
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:20,866
More than 10 times.

244
00:20:27,237 --> 00:20:29,237
You're the one who will be sued.

245
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:32,478
Nuck-Nan.

246
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,089
Huh?

247
00:20:33,089 --> 00:20:34,596
Can I borrow your computer?

248
00:20:36,639 --> 00:20:37,944
I'm tired for real.

249
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,484
Go ahead.

250
00:20:41,412 --> 00:20:43,736
New mic and new camera. Try it out.

251
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:47,132
I'll go pee.

252
00:20:58,818 --> 00:20:59,960
You have unread messages.

253
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:04,909
Sorry, I didn't have time to use computer.

254
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,154
Sorry, I was busy studying.

255
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,337
I'm sorry, Name. Let's talk later.

256
00:21:14,664 --> 00:21:15,784
What are you doing?

257
00:21:20,001 --> 00:21:23,159
I'm really exhausted.
I didn't intend to ignore you.

258
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,342
Let's wait for this period to pass.

259
00:21:48,562 --> 00:21:51,859
Let's talk later, Name.
I don't want to pick up a fight with you.

260
00:22:03,244 --> 00:22:05,661
Food is ready! You can come get it.

261
00:22:09,705 --> 00:22:11,103
Come here.

262
00:22:15,205 --> 00:22:16,371
Can I come in?

263
00:22:21,878 --> 00:22:23,137
Let's eat.

264
00:22:27,006 --> 00:22:29,330
What's wrong?
Did you have a quarrel with Em?

265
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,818
Em is studying.

266
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,620
It's normal to have new society and friends.

267
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,800
(He promised me.)

268
00:22:46,852 --> 00:22:48,852
But he didn't break your promise.

269
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:51,306
He still talks to you.

270
00:22:51,831 --> 00:22:53,460
Just less than before.

271
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:59,600
(He promised me. He promised to me!)

272
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,600
(He promised! He promised!)

273
00:23:02,628 --> 00:23:04,628
He has to live his life!

274
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:07,814
And you have to live yours too!

275
00:23:10,001 --> 00:23:12,488
You can't stay in your room forever.

276
00:23:13,579 --> 00:23:15,579
I tried everything I can to help you.

277
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:17,807
Every way that is possible.

278
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,419
But you never try to help yourself.

279
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,050
If you still be like this,

280
00:23:26,847 --> 00:23:28,847
You'll be the one who loses

281
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,240
I'll let you figure it out yourself.

282
00:23:36,603 --> 00:23:38,279
And if you don't want to eat,

283
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,036
then don't.

284
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:52,400
Em.

285
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:56,450
Em.

286
00:24:59,342 --> 00:25:00,000
Em.

287
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:05,414
Em.

288
00:25:10,873 --> 00:25:11,576
Em.

289
00:25:32,521 --> 00:25:37,810
[If we could turn back time]

290
00:25:38,834 --> 00:25:44,031
[I would love to go through everything with you again]

291
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:52,273
[Those familiar words]

292
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:59,030
[I can still remember them]

293
00:26:00,401 --> 00:26:01,104
Em.

294
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:01,990
Huh?

295
00:26:01,991 --> 00:26:02,694
This is for you.

296
00:26:03,868 --> 00:26:04,617
Thank you.

297
00:26:18,564 --> 00:26:19,128
Whoa.

298
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:23,159
Good thing I was around, so I bought it for you.

299
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:28,365
Yeah.

300
00:26:30,001 --> 00:26:30,796
You see,

301
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,241
I studied very hard

302
00:26:35,424 --> 00:26:36,961
and joined extracurricular activity.

303
00:26:36,962 --> 00:26:37,665
Hm.

304
00:26:39,316 --> 00:26:40,000
Damn it

305
00:26:40,359 --> 00:26:41,896
I have a quiz today too.

306
00:26:44,903 --> 00:26:46,115
Can I ask you something?

307
00:26:46,116 --> 00:26:46,633
Um.

308
00:26:46,974 --> 00:26:48,233
Are you fighting with Name?

309
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,209
You got the news quicker than ITV.

310
00:26:58,907 --> 00:26:59,517
Ha.

311
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:00,838
You fool!

312
00:27:00,838 --> 00:27:03,116
It's not ITV, but TITV nowadays.

313
00:27:03,387 --> 00:27:04,507
You're old-fashioned.

314
00:27:06,612 --> 00:27:07,268
Oh.

315
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:08,496
How is it, then?

316
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:10,516
What are you arguing about?

317
00:27:10,949 --> 00:27:12,069
Is it because you don't have time?

318
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:18,309
Yeah.

319
00:27:18,557 --> 00:27:19,352
You know.

320
00:27:20,235 --> 00:27:22,235
I don't even have time to eat.

321
00:27:23,171 --> 00:27:24,522
And I have books to study.

322
00:27:25,048 --> 00:27:26,214
Lots of them.

323
00:27:30,265 --> 00:27:31,199
I think...

324
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:33,540
You haven't tried hard enough.

325
00:27:34,222 --> 00:27:35,840
I understand Name.

326
00:27:36,052 --> 00:27:37,311
He is the one waiting.

327
00:27:39,089 --> 00:27:40,579
I understand his reason.

328
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,098
How so?

329
00:27:48,748 --> 00:27:49,497
So...

330
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:50,935
Think about it.

331
00:27:51,322 --> 00:27:53,461
Whether you have time or not,

332
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:55,462
at least you should let him know.

333
00:27:55,463 --> 00:27:57,463
But you just let him wait and feel neglected.

334
00:27:57,982 --> 00:27:59,380
If it were me, I would run away

335
00:27:59,766 --> 00:28:00,700
I'll surely leave you.

336
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:10,301
There, there.

337
00:28:11,151 --> 00:28:13,151
I said it because I mean well.

338
00:28:17,184 --> 00:28:18,026
Alright

339
00:28:18,366 --> 00:28:19,347
I'll figure this out.

340
00:28:25,977 --> 00:28:27,192
Let's talk about you.

341
00:28:27,854 --> 00:28:28,603
About what?

342
00:28:29,686 --> 00:28:30,435
What?

343
00:28:31,954 --> 00:28:34,120
Of course it's about how you lied to Golf

344
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,613
that your name is Korn

345
00:28:37,046 --> 00:28:38,351
not "Gun".

346
00:28:39,293 --> 00:28:40,644
Keep it down!

347
00:28:42,792 --> 00:28:43,680
You bastard.

348
00:28:44,544 --> 00:28:45,571
How do you know?

349
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,177
Whoaa.

350
00:28:49,425 --> 00:28:50,359
Sir Gun.

351
00:28:50,746 --> 00:28:52,375
How long have we been friends?

352
00:28:53,577 --> 00:28:56,874
I asked you classmate if they know Gun.

353
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,134
And no one knows.

354
00:28:58,566 --> 00:29:00,334
There's only Korn and Korn alone.

355
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:03,036
Be quiet!

356
00:29:03,238 --> 00:29:03,987
Shh.

357
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:08,980
I don't have the guts to tell him.

358
00:29:09,552 --> 00:29:10,440
I'm scared.

359
00:29:13,747 --> 00:29:14,450
Okay.

360
00:29:15,644 --> 00:29:17,644
Get a grip on yourself.

361
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:20,205
Tell him the truth when you're ready.

362
00:29:20,406 --> 00:29:21,757
Don't lie for too long.

363
00:29:22,468 --> 00:29:23,727
It'll be a problem later.

364
00:29:25,825 --> 00:29:26,481
Um

365
00:29:26,775 --> 00:29:27,709
I know.

366
00:29:33,519 --> 00:29:34,546
Hey.

367
00:29:35,072 --> 00:29:36,145
Why the sullen face?

368
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,426
Stop it

369
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:41,200
I'll buy you a drink.

370
00:29:41,692 --> 00:29:42,256
Um.

371
00:29:42,596 --> 00:29:43,762
But you have to buy me food next time.

372
00:29:44,797 --> 00:29:45,685
Deal?

373
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:46,901
What?

374
00:29:46,902 --> 00:29:48,485
What kind of bullshxt is that?

375
00:29:48,485 --> 00:29:50,000
I already bought you this sandwich.

376
00:29:50,001 --> 00:29:50,796
Come on.

377
00:29:50,797 --> 00:29:52,334
No, you fool.

378
00:29:52,335 --> 00:29:53,130
What?

379
00:29:53,131 --> 00:29:54,019
I already treated you.

380
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,047
Do you want me to shout?

381
00:29:55,048 --> 00:29:56,168
I'll shout out your name.

382
00:29:57,533 --> 00:29:58,421
G... G

383
00:29:58,421 --> 00:29:59,154
Read!

384
00:29:59,155 --> 00:30:00,000
Korn.

385
00:30:00,001 --> 00:30:00,750
Hey.

386
00:30:01,183 --> 00:30:02,349
I said the right one.

387
00:30:06,214 --> 00:30:07,241
Shut up.

388
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:20,000
Hi, Mr. 8.

389
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:21,813
Long time no see.

390
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:29,627
Hello there.

391
00:30:30,001 --> 00:30:32,418
Yeah. It's been a long time.

392
00:30:33,231 --> 00:30:36,297
There's a lot of things to change
when you went to university.

393
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:38,946
How have you been?

394
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:41,376
Well, I have to adjust a lot.

395
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:43,673
Fortunately, I have a good friend.

396
00:30:47,482 --> 00:30:50,000
Is that friend better than me?

397
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:56,096
Mr. 8, you're always number one.

398
00:31:12,042 --> 00:31:12,930
Mr. 8.

399
00:31:13,689 --> 00:31:14,484
There's...

400
00:31:15,561 --> 00:31:17,237
something I want to tell you.

401
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,569
What is it?

402
00:31:36,432 --> 00:31:37,876
Actually,

403
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,290
I...

404
00:31:47,808 --> 00:31:48,372
I...

405
00:31:48,851 --> 00:31:50,851
I may not be available these days

406
00:31:51,528 --> 00:31:52,833
because I have lots of work to do.

407
00:31:57,306 --> 00:31:59,121
No, you're good.

408
00:31:59,414 --> 00:32:01,182
Just text me when you're free.

409
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:32,967
Hey.

410
00:32:33,632 --> 00:32:35,076
Do you want to eat mango with me?

411
00:32:45,941 --> 00:32:46,736
Oh, right.

412
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:52,344
Em told me he won't be online in MSN for a whole month.

413
00:33:24,576 --> 00:33:25,881
(Why did he tell you?)

414
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:30,221
He is like in a different time zone with you.

415
00:33:30,654 --> 00:33:31,913
So he asked me to tell you.

416
00:33:32,531 --> 00:33:33,743
But that's all.

417
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:51,320
(Why didn't he tell me?)

418
00:33:59,633 --> 00:34:01,633
He's acting like normal people.

419
00:34:03,965 --> 00:34:06,567
And you should do that too.

420
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,820
(Why did it turn out like this?)

421
00:34:16,794 --> 00:34:19,211
You chose to live like this yourself

422
00:34:19,814 --> 00:34:21,351
and you should accept it.

423
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,200
(Why?)

424
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:40,685
(I don't understand.)

425
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:52,735
Are you really not going to talk to me?

426
00:35:01,877 --> 00:35:03,228
I talked to the doctor.

427
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:08,018
She said you can talk.

428
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,577
But you chose to use sign language.

429
00:35:18,648 --> 00:35:20,277
Now you're going as far as writing it down.

430
00:35:22,144 --> 00:35:23,217
Why?

431
00:35:29,181 --> 00:35:31,181
You really don't want to talk to me?

432
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:39,267
Or do you want to be mute for real?

433
00:35:41,003 --> 00:35:46,120
[If we could turn back time]

434
00:35:47,507 --> 00:35:52,796
[I would love to go through everything with you again]

435
00:35:55,194 --> 00:36:00,993
[Those familiar words]

436
00:36:02,323 --> 00:36:07,334
[I can still remember it]

437
00:36:46,295 --> 00:36:47,080
Nid?

438
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,508
You're staying up late and doing the laundry like me!

439
00:36:58,161 --> 00:36:58,840
Nid?

440
00:37:02,856 --> 00:37:03,883
Are you alright?

441
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:06,130
You can tell me anything.

442
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:11,030
It's nothing.

443
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:13,681
Forget it.

444
00:37:18,865 --> 00:37:19,660
Hey.

445
00:37:19,661 --> 00:37:21,661
Although I'm not your family member,

446
00:37:23,081 --> 00:37:26,193
if you're facing any trouble that I could help,

447
00:37:26,967 --> 00:37:28,840
you can tell me right away.

448
00:37:32,507 --> 00:37:33,395
So.

449
00:37:33,396 --> 00:37:36,276
We're single moms. I understand you.

450
00:37:37,337 --> 00:37:39,337
We have almost no one to rely on.

451
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:46,027
When Em's dad passed away,

452
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,389
Em was still a little kid.

453
00:37:49,494 --> 00:37:51,494
I had to work hard like you.

454
00:38:00,803 --> 00:38:02,803
Even though we're now a mother

455
00:38:04,521 --> 00:38:06,892
there's still a little girl inside us.

456
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,640
I never understood my mother.

457
00:38:14,489 --> 00:38:15,933
Until I became one.

458
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:22,042
I missed her.

459
00:38:23,865 --> 00:38:25,263
If she was still here,

460
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:27,681
I would be scolded for
doing the laundry so late at night

461
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:29,120
I'm sure of it.

462
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:37,548
Nid.

463
00:38:38,746 --> 00:38:40,422
If you're really tired

464
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:43,086
and your mother is still there,

465
00:38:44,499 --> 00:38:46,916
you can ask her for good advice.

466
00:38:53,095 --> 00:38:53,705
Alright?

467
00:38:54,184 --> 00:38:54,840
Yes

468
00:38:55,829 --> 00:38:56,717
I'll go to sleep.

469
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,594
Thank you so much.

470
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:33,480
Hello.

471
00:39:34,178 --> 00:39:35,298
How are you, Nid?

472
00:39:36,055 --> 00:39:37,036
Hello, mom.

473
00:39:38,728 --> 00:39:40,311
Are you still up this late?

474
00:39:41,361 --> 00:39:42,805
I already slept.

475
00:39:44,332 --> 00:39:45,683
How about you?

476
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:49,638
I answered your call as soon as I saw it.

477
00:39:50,256 --> 00:39:51,700
What's wrong?

478
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Can I ask you something?

479
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:05,709
Sure.

480
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:15,321
When I had a fight with you

481
00:40:16,386 --> 00:40:18,386
and refuse to talk to you,

482
00:40:20,674 --> 00:40:22,303
does it hurt?

483
00:40:30,292 --> 00:40:31,736
Of course.

484
00:40:33,558 --> 00:40:35,558
But you are my daughter

485
00:40:35,936 --> 00:40:37,936
I'm fine the second you smile at me.

486
00:40:52,569 --> 00:40:55,079
Then, when I was pregnant before graduation,

487
00:40:58,246 --> 00:40:59,720
were you mad at me?

488
00:41:00,885 --> 00:41:01,958
No.

489
00:41:04,701 --> 00:41:05,960
But I was afraid...

490
00:41:07,835 --> 00:41:10,437
that people would look down on you.

491
00:41:14,232 --> 00:41:15,908
I don't want you to overthink it.

492
00:41:26,957 --> 00:41:28,957
I was afraid you were not ready.

493
00:41:31,101 --> 00:41:33,101
But for me, I'm always ready.

494
00:41:34,901 --> 00:41:36,901
Ready for all the problems that come at you.

495
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:48,191
At that time, instead of the graduation gown,

496
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:51,610
you saw me in the maternity clothes.

497
00:41:58,176 --> 00:42:00,176
In the past, no matter what problem I had,

498
00:42:00,177 --> 00:42:01,806
I always vented my anger on you.

499
00:42:06,379 --> 00:42:07,962
I never understood you.

500
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:15,502
But you always try to understand me.

501
00:42:22,586 --> 00:42:24,262
If I could go back in time,

502
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,100
I wouldn't do that.

503
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:32,615
I'm really sorry, mom.

504
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:40,000
Never mind. I understand.

505
00:42:45,146 --> 00:42:47,146
Even though you're now a mother,

506
00:42:47,784 --> 00:42:51,035
you'll always be a little girl in my eyes.

507
00:42:56,724 --> 00:42:59,604
You can call me whenever you want.

508
00:43:05,945 --> 00:43:07,713
Okay.

509
00:43:09,658 --> 00:43:11,195
It's late. You should go to sleep.

510
00:43:18,377 --> 00:43:19,682
Okay, bye.

00:43:59,687 --> 00:44:01,687
It's almost midnight and you're still practicing?

518
00:44:01,688 --> 00:44:03,688
Are you applying for world cup or something?

519
00:44:04,205 --> 00:44:06,205
It's almost the Freshy Game day.

520
00:44:08,018 --> 00:44:10,265
Take care. Eat properly.

521
00:44:10,265 --> 00:44:12,265
Don't die before me.

522
00:44:14,649 --> 00:44:15,537
Ehhh.

523
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,043
Em.

524
00:44:17,598 --> 00:44:22,007
So... I want to ask you something.

525
00:44:24,532 --> 00:44:25,374
Um.

526
00:44:26,038 --> 00:44:26,880
What is it?

527
00:44:29,382 --> 00:44:30,316
The thing is.

528
00:44:38,659 --> 00:44:39,362
So.

529
00:44:45,799 --> 00:44:47,799
Look at this.

530
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:49,531
What's that?

531
00:44:51,215 --> 00:44:52,427
My academic record.

532
00:44:52,428 --> 00:44:53,177
Look.

533
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:55,520
And...

534
00:44:55,844 --> 00:44:57,844
why are you showing me this?

535
00:44:58,241 --> 00:44:59,036
Because

536
00:44:59,315 --> 00:45:02,705
I want to show how good Tutor Chompu is.

537
00:45:03,577 --> 00:45:04,789
Ever since you tutored me

538
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,790
and I stop going to night club,

539
00:45:06,791 --> 00:45:08,096
My grades have improved a lot.

540
00:45:08,828 --> 00:45:12,450
So I'm not only your friend, but your tutor too?

541
00:45:15,553 --> 00:45:16,456
Then.

542
00:45:16,919 --> 00:45:18,827
Do you want to be anything else?

543
00:45:19,729 --> 00:45:21,040
Stop daydreaming.

544
00:45:22,621 --> 00:45:23,509
Thank you, Chompu.

545
00:45:24,281 --> 00:45:25,632
Don't mention it.

546
00:45:26,236 --> 00:45:28,236
You're good at it too.

547
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,288
Chompu.

548
00:45:33,462 --> 00:45:34,257
What?

549
00:45:38,019 --> 00:45:38,907
Can I ask you something?

550
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,325
Soo.

551
00:45:43,777 --> 00:45:45,777
We've talked for quite some time.

552
00:45:47,509 --> 00:45:50,000
And see each other's faces several times.

553
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,706
I would like to meet you in person.

554
00:46:00,564 --> 00:46:01,452
Sure.

555
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:05,542
But before that,

556
00:46:07,437 --> 00:46:10,456
I want you to know something.

557
00:46:14,759 --> 00:46:15,971
What is it?

558
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:53,440
[Writing until it become stories]

559
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:59,273

(Next Episode)
You got a spaced-out look

564
00:47:20,121 --> 00:47:22,121
I just think aimlessly.

565
00:47:22,507 --> 00:47:23,488
Sorry.

566
00:47:24,255 --> 00:47:26,255
Is there any way, professor?

567
00:47:28,258 --> 00:47:30,000
Surprise!

568
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:30,796
Sis!

569
00:47:31,507 --> 00:47:32,400
How did you get here?

570
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:36,881
Why are you stressed?

571
00:47:41,222 --> 00:47:42,295
Hello, Chompu.

572
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:43,508
Hello, Nuck-Nan.
