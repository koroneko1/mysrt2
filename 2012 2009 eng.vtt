01:40.850 --> 01:42.935
Hey, hey, watch out. Watch out.

01:47.732 --> 01:48.857
Welcome, my friend.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.109
Great to see you.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.152
Yeah, glad you made it.

01:52.737 --> 01:55.572
This can't be Ajit.
He's a little man already.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.075
- Unbelievable.
- I hope you're hungry, Adrian.

01:58.243 --> 02:00.536
I'm famished. How are you, Aparna?

02:00.704 --> 02:03.205
- I made that fish curry you love.
- I can't wait.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.875
She gets more beautiful
every time I see her. Why is that?

02:07.043 --> 02:10.713
Strange, isn't it?
But her fish curry is still awful.

02:12.632 --> 02:15.384
You were mysterious on the phone.
Why didn't you attend the conference?

02:15.552 --> 02:19.388
- I will show you, Adrian, sir.
- Satnam, stop "siring" me.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.105
How deep do we need to go?

02:28.273 --> 02:29.648
Eleven thousand feet.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.277
I searched all over India
for this thing.

02:33.570 --> 02:36.238
Used to be the deepest copper mine
in the world.

02:40.910 --> 02:43.203
Remember my brother, Gurdeep?
He's a student now.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.289
Namaste, Dr. Helmsley, sir.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.916
Adrian. It's just Adrian.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.671
Just don't pour too much, huh?

02:54.632 --> 02:56.925
How do you work in this heat?

02:57.093 --> 02:58.802
You've come on a good day,
my friend.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.930
Sometimes it can hit 120 degrees.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.391
You have to come and meet
Dr. Lokesh...

03:04.559 --> 03:07.353
...a Fellow of quantum physics
at the university in Chennai.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.480
Dr. Helmsley.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.901
So, what are we looking at?

03:14.069 --> 03:15.778
These are neutrinos acting normally.

03:15.945 --> 03:18.947
Minuscule mass,
no electrical charge.

03:19.115 --> 03:21.617
They pass through ordinary matter
almost undisturbed.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.870
Your message said the count doubled
after the last solar eruptions.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.039
That was last week.

03:27.999 --> 03:30.417
But this happened two days ago.

03:34.756 --> 03:38.092
The biggest Sun eruptions
in human history...

03:38.259 --> 03:41.303
...causing the highest neutrino count
we've ever recorded.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.806
My God.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.686
That's not what worries me, Adrian.

03:50.146 --> 03:52.147
For the first time ever...

03:53.400 --> 03:55.859
...the neutrinos are causing
a physical reaction.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.489
That's impossible.

04:04.786 --> 04:06.495
That feels very good.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.916
Please, follow me.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.547
You won't believe this.

04:18.341 --> 04:21.844
This water tank goes down
another 6000 feet.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.305
It looks like the neutrinos
coming from the Sun...

04:25.473 --> 04:29.018
...have mutated into a new kind
of nuclear particle.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.527
They're heating up
the Earth's core...

04:39.154 --> 04:41.530
...and suddenly act like microwaves.

04:54.252 --> 04:57.671
Ladies and gentlemen,
as promised, no speech...

04:58.548 --> 05:00.716
...just a thank-you...

05:00.884 --> 05:03.635
...because tonight,
with your extraordinary generosity...

05:03.803 --> 05:07.473
...we have raised $1.7 million.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.893
Have a stiff drink,
because I'm locking the doors...

05:11.061 --> 05:14.146
- ... and passing the hat around again.
- It's okay. It's okay.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.315
- I work for the White House.
- I don't care.

05:16.483 --> 05:18.442
This is a black-tie event.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.361
Scotty.

05:20.612 --> 05:24.239
Hey. Adrian, I thought you were
in India. What's going on?

05:24.407 --> 05:26.075
- I need yourjacket.
- What?

05:26.242 --> 05:29.119
I gotta speak to Anheuser.
Give me your damn jacket, please.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.621
- All right.
- Okay?

05:30.789 --> 05:33.457
- All right, here. Here.
- Hold that for a minute, will you?

05:36.753 --> 05:38.837
Hey! Easy, that's a $600 jacket.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.007
Mr. Anheuser?

05:42.175 --> 05:43.425
Mr. Anheuser.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.595
I need to talk to you.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.849
- Do I know you?
- Sorry, sir.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.434
My name's Dr. Adrian Helmsley.

05:52.602 --> 05:56.563
I'm a deputy geologist at the Office
of Science and Technology Policy.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.108
Excuse me, fellas.

05:59.275 --> 06:03.195
You know that this is a fundraiser,
not a frat party, right?

06:03.363 --> 06:05.781
- It's important, sir.
- You know what? It always is.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.450
Make an appointment with my...
You know, even better:

06:08.618 --> 06:11.161
Have your boss bring it up
at the quarterly briefing.

06:11.329 --> 06:13.080
There's a good plan.

06:13.498 --> 06:15.833
I just traveled 20 straight hours
to get here, sir.

06:16.001 --> 06:17.751
I haven't slept in two days.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.463
You need to read this, sir.
You need to read it now.

06:26.636 --> 06:30.055
Let me guess,
national geology crisis?

06:31.057 --> 06:32.224
Excuse me.

06:50.368 --> 06:52.828
- Who do you report to?
- Lee Cavazos.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.955
Not anymore.

06:57.625 --> 07:00.127
Alan, bring the car around.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.546
- You're gonna wish you took a shower.
- Sir?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.423
You're about to meet the president.

07:04.591 --> 07:05.841
What's going on?

07:06.009 --> 07:07.926
Get that to the office.

07:13.558 --> 07:16.935
No G8! No G8! No G8!

07:37.707 --> 07:38.707
Good morning.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.419
I would like to meet privately
with my fellow heads of state.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.050
Mr. Makarenko wishes
to have his interpreters present.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.220
Mr. President, I can assure you...

07:51.596 --> 07:55.891
...your English is more than sufficient
for what I have to say.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.871
Mr. Presidents.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.168
Six months ago...

08:23.545 --> 08:27.464
...I was made aware of a situation
so devastating...

08:27.757 --> 08:31.260
...that, at first, I refused to believe it.

08:32.053 --> 08:33.470
However...

08:33.929 --> 08:36.515
...through the concerted efforts...

08:36.683 --> 08:39.226
...of our brightest scientists...

08:39.394 --> 08:43.272
...we have confirmed its validity.

08:45.150 --> 08:49.069
The world as we know it...

08:50.613 --> 08:52.948
...will soon come to an end.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.461
This dam project
will create many newjobs.

09:05.879 --> 09:10.966
The Party and country
will assist in your relocation.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.178
Grandma, give me your hand.

09:14.721 --> 09:17.056
- But where are they taking us?
- It'll be all right.

09:22.479 --> 09:23.520
Brother!

09:24.356 --> 09:26.357
Grandma, I will send you money.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.655
Who can write?

09:34.616 --> 09:35.824
Who can read?

09:37.327 --> 09:38.410
Who can weld?

10:11.152 --> 10:15.197
Has His Highness had an opportunity
to study the dossier?

10:19.452 --> 10:23.288
You must understand,
I have a very big family, Mr...?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.374
Isaacs.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.043
One billion dollars is a lot of money.

10:29.379 --> 10:34.049
I'm afraid the amount is in euros,
Your Highness.

10:49.941 --> 10:53.819
I put a lot of faith
into your organization.

10:55.613 --> 10:58.407
It's a perfect replica, Roland.

10:59.451 --> 11:01.118
There are too many fanatics out there
that could damage her.

11:02.162 --> 11:05.664
Just think about the beautiful Buddha
statues they blew up in Afghanistan.

11:06.958 --> 11:10.794
Our Heritage Organization
has already made selections...

11:10.962 --> 11:13.797
...from the British Museum
and L'Hermitage.

11:21.264 --> 11:24.141
I guess she'll be safe now,
tucked away...

11:24.768 --> 11:29.521
...hidden in some bunker
in Switzerland.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.108
Perfectly safe, Roland.

11:34.277 --> 11:37.196
Only infrared analysis
would reveal the difference.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.616
But it's still a fake.

11:54.464 --> 11:57.883
This mass suicide was actually
discovered by a documentary crew...

11:58.051 --> 12:00.344
...here in the ancient Mayan city
of Tikal.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.513
Now, the victims,
and we've seen many...

12:02.681 --> 12:05.391
...are said to have adhered
to the Mayan-Quiche calendar...

12:05.558 --> 12:07.643
...which predicts
the end of time to occur...

12:07.811 --> 12:10.020
...on the 21st of December
of this year...

12:10.188 --> 12:12.231
...due to the Sun's
destructive forces.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.482
Thank you, Mark.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.360
Strangely enough,
scientific records do support the fact...

12:18.029 --> 12:21.615
...that we are heading for the biggest
solar climax in recorded history.

12:25.954 --> 12:26.995
Well, yes.

12:27.163 --> 12:31.000
Apparently many people believe
that the Mayan calendar predicts...

12:31.167 --> 12:33.711
...that there's supposed
to be a galactic alignment...

12:33.878 --> 12:34.920
I'm a dead man.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.923
I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.385
...it's the end of the world in 2012.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.554
Goddamn it.

12:48.018 --> 12:51.353
Hey, Kate. I'm practically
on the freeway right now.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.940
Yes, I'm hurtling toward you
as we speak.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.277
Will you relax?
Yeah, I'll be there any second.

12:59.362 --> 13:02.531
You know it's a vacation
and not a doctor's appointment, right?

13:02.699 --> 13:04.199
That it's supposed to be fun?

13:04.367 --> 13:06.326
You remember fun, don't you, Kate?

13:06.536 --> 13:10.080
Do you remember where you were
when it stopped being fun for you?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.709
Yeah. I got it.

13:18.423 --> 13:22.176
Bug spray? Oh, yeah, because
it's mosquito season in Yellowstone.

13:22.344 --> 13:26.930
I got a whole bunch. Okay, I gotta go,
because I'm in a bad-reception area.

13:33.688 --> 13:34.730
Whoa, man.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.690
Would you look at that?

13:36.900 --> 13:38.275
Sick.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.824
Merrill, I told you.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.827
We have to move back
to Wisconsin.

13:48.995 --> 13:52.331
Yeah, but these little mini-quakes
are really getting on my nerves.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.584
A little surface crack? You're not
gonna be inconvenienced by that.

13:55.752 --> 13:58.379
Right, surface cracks.
I got a plastic surgeon for that.

13:58.546 --> 14:00.839
Thank God for those shake-proof
coffee mugs, Lisa.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.092
They show the true nature
of us Californians.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.178
We'll not bow to these inconvenient
things like surface cracks.

14:07.639 --> 14:12.101
If you have a funny mini-quake story
and wanna share it, call 555-1070...

14:20.318 --> 14:21.652
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, baby.

14:22.112 --> 14:24.279
- How are you, sweetie?
- Good.

14:24.447 --> 14:25.948
Jackson, what is this?

14:26.533 --> 14:28.367
Please don't call me that.
I'm your dad.

14:29.577 --> 14:30.619
Come on.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.247
You're taking them camping
in a limo?

14:33.665 --> 14:34.957
Okay, great.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.750
What happened to your temp job?

14:36.918 --> 14:39.753
Oh, you know, better hours,
more time to write.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.673
What about sleeping? Have you
been doing any of that lately?

14:42.841 --> 14:47.970
I've said it a thousand times, no lipo
on Fridays. It's too messy. Hold on.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.471
- Morning, Jackson.
- Hi.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.806
- Nice ride.
- Thanks.

14:50.974 --> 14:52.307
Guys, have a nice trip.

14:52.475 --> 14:55.144
Remember, watch out for the bears.
You know, they're:

14:55.311 --> 14:56.520
Bye, Gordon.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.647
- Love you, honey.
- Bye.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.899
- Okay, so, Lil... Oh, yeah.
- You tell him.

15:01.693 --> 15:02.735
Tell me what?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.487
She needs to put these on
before she goes to sleep.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.322
- Still?
- Yes.

15:07.490 --> 15:11.035
Your 7-year-old still wets her bed.
That's something you should know.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.495
- I love you.
- Love you, Mom.

15:13.872 --> 15:15.998
- Hey.
- You okay?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.586
They've been looking forward
to spending time with you.

15:20.754 --> 15:21.837
I know.

15:22.005 --> 15:24.882
- So don't be on your computer.
- Got it.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.596
Love you.

15:34.476 --> 15:37.686
- So this time, we hit Japan.
- So?

15:37.854 --> 15:39.563
Well, you could visit your boy, Will.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.065
Afternoon, ladies.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.733
- Hello there.
- Hello, handsome.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.276
Are you even listening to me?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.028
Unfortunately, I am, Harry.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.072
I heard from Audrey
you're a grandpa now.

15:48.239 --> 15:50.699
Would you mind keeping your nose
out of my family?

15:50.867 --> 15:53.786
You're cramping my style, baby.
There we are.

15:53.953 --> 15:57.414
So he married a Japanese girl.
How is that the end of the world?

15:57.582 --> 15:59.708
Come on, Tony.
You should at least go see him.

15:59.876 --> 16:02.586
- You see your boy?
- Not as much as I'd like.

16:02.754 --> 16:05.130
D.C. is a long way,
but at least we talk.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.632
About what?

16:06.800 --> 16:10.469
Life, and how short it is.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.453
What the hell was that?

16:41.710 --> 16:42.751
Hello?

16:43.211 --> 16:44.586
Laura.

16:45.380 --> 16:46.755
Laura, can you hear me?

16:47.090 --> 16:48.632
Roland, is that you?

16:48.800 --> 16:50.759
Laura, they lied to us.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.178
I've arranged a press conference
for tomorrow.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.764
I will tell everyone the truth
about what's going on.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.433
What are you talking about?

16:57.600 --> 16:59.143
The art you collected...

16:59.894 --> 17:01.562
...it's not in the Alps.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.105
Those tunnels are empty.

17:03.273 --> 17:04.356
I have proof!

17:06.151 --> 17:07.276
Laura.

17:07.444 --> 17:08.609
Laura, can you hear me?

17:09.404 --> 17:12.364
- I'm losing you. Roland?
- Laura, can you hear me?

17:12.531 --> 17:13.615
Laura.

17:37.766 --> 17:39.475
Break it down.

17:43.688 --> 17:45.314
- I liked that song.
- We lost it.

17:45.482 --> 17:49.276
...going on the West Coast
with all those surface cracks.

17:49.444 --> 17:53.822
I told myself, "Charlie,
get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. "

17:53.990 --> 17:57.659
I don't want to miss all the fun
when it finally blows.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.120
Let me tell you,
there's been government people...

18:00.288 --> 18:05.584
...flying in and out all morning,
and trust me, they did not look happy.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.087
- Always remember folks:
- That's weird.

18:08.254 --> 18:11.256
- You heard it first from Charlie.
- Yeah, just when he said that?

18:11.925 --> 18:14.009
What are the odds?

18:14.177 --> 18:16.428
We're not seeing soil liquefaction
we'd expect...

18:16.596 --> 18:19.890
...or any evidence of fracture
propagation within the tectonic plates.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.101
- In English.
- The activity on the coast...

18:22.268 --> 18:24.728
...is not caused by tecto...
By regular earthquakes.

18:24.896 --> 18:28.273
And these surface cracks have
nothing to do with shifting fault lines.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.652
You suggesting this could be the
beginning of the Cho Ming operation?

18:31.820 --> 18:35.155
Dr. Helmsley is flying to Yellowstone
this morning to collect more data.

18:35.323 --> 18:39.368
We have been following the schedule
you established, Mr. Helmsley.

18:39.536 --> 18:42.037
The most important schedule
in the history of mankind.

18:42.205 --> 18:44.873
Now you're telling me
we have to throw it out?

18:45.041 --> 18:46.667
Yes, sir.

18:48.003 --> 18:49.545
I was wrong.

18:53.174 --> 18:56.593
Do you know how many times
I've heard those words in this office?

18:57.262 --> 18:58.429
Zero.

19:01.016 --> 19:02.057
Did you see this?

19:02.267 --> 19:04.393
I'm sorry, Mr. President.
She insisted.

19:04.561 --> 19:05.894
It's all over the news.

19:09.232 --> 19:11.900
We are learning more
about this deadly car explosion.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.778
The director
of the French National Museums...

19:14.946 --> 19:18.073
...was to hold a press conference
at the Louvre this morning.

19:18.241 --> 19:22.202
Coincidentally, his death took place
in the same Paris tunnel...

19:22.370 --> 19:25.581
...where Princess Diana died
in 1997.

19:25.749 --> 19:28.292
We are continuing to follow this story.
We will...

19:29.419 --> 19:32.588
Laura, I don't believe you've met
Dr. Helmsley.

19:33.923 --> 19:36.008
I just talked to him, Dad,
and he told me...

19:36.176 --> 19:38.594
...that the organization
that I work for is a sham.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.387
I mean, why would he say that?

19:44.559 --> 19:47.061
You look just like your mother
when you get upset.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.520
Did I ever tell you that?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.898
Every time I get upset.

19:51.066 --> 19:52.691
Daddy, a man was killed.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.946
Honey, please sit down.

20:08.458 --> 20:10.626
Only a dozen people
in this administration...

20:10.794 --> 20:12.753
...know what I'm about to tell you.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.005
Dad, what's going on?

20:18.468 --> 20:23.472
An unprecedented international
endeavor is underway.

20:23.890 --> 20:28.185
At this point,
46 nations are invested in this thing.

20:28.645 --> 20:30.479
Laura's a smart girl.
She'll understand.

20:30.647 --> 20:34.274
That thing in Paris, we're not involved
in any of that, are we?

20:34.442 --> 20:37.861
We? Who the hell is "we"?
What are you talking about?

20:38.029 --> 20:40.823
We need to focus on this timeline.
That's what we need to do.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.409
- When do we let the country know?
- What do you mean?

20:43.576 --> 20:47.037
The people, sir. They need to know.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.790
Well, of course they do.

20:49.958 --> 20:54.378
Listen, yourjob is to figure out
when this is all gonna fall apart.

20:54.546 --> 20:55.838
My job is to figure out...

20:56.006 --> 20:59.341
...how to retain some semblance
of government after it falls apart.

20:59.509 --> 21:01.593
Until then,
we don't have time for anything...

21:01.761 --> 21:03.679
...except for doing those jobs. Okay?

21:03.847 --> 21:06.348
Call me the moment you get any news
from Yellowstone.

21:06.516 --> 21:07.516
Yes, sir.

21:08.727 --> 21:09.768
Cute girl, huh?

21:10.395 --> 21:12.021
- Sir?
- The First Daughter.

21:12.188 --> 21:15.107
- I saw you looking at her.
- I wasn't looking at her.

21:15.275 --> 21:18.610
Better move fast, kid.
The end is near.

21:19.362 --> 21:23.323
Adrian, your chopper's ready.
They're waiting on the South Lawn.

21:24.868 --> 21:27.036
Daddy, where are we going?

21:27.203 --> 21:30.205
Going to this really special place
that I know.

21:30.373 --> 21:33.208
It's a place where your mom and I
used to hang out a lot.

21:33.376 --> 21:35.711
I don't wanna know
where you and Mom had sex.

21:35.879 --> 21:38.422
- I'm not ready for that, Jackson.
- Stop calling me that.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.759
It's creeping me out.
What's wrong with "Dad"?

21:41.926 --> 21:43.886
- Grumpy Grumperson.
- Daddy, look at this.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.056
That wasn't here before.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.350
What do we do?

21:49.726 --> 21:51.435
Go get your hat.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.108
Don't you see the signs?

22:06.159 --> 22:07.826
Used to be a lake here.

22:08.244 --> 22:10.162
Doesn't look much of a lake to me.

22:10.705 --> 22:12.915
I know,
the whole damn thing's gone.

22:14.709 --> 22:17.336
- Come on, let's check it out.
- Grwat.

22:39.609 --> 22:41.944
Subjects have now entered
hot zone.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.167
Who is that?

22:58.586 --> 22:59.878
That's the U.S. Army.

23:10.473 --> 23:14.101
All manner of government vehicle
are converging on subjects.

23:14.269 --> 23:15.853
You're in a restricted area, sir.

23:16.021 --> 23:18.689
- We need you to come with us.
- Right. Right.

23:18.857 --> 23:20.983
Okay, we're gonna go
with these guys.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.192
That'll be fun, huh?

23:25.822 --> 23:27.281
This is wild.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.533
This is really wild.

23:40.837 --> 23:44.631
This is unbelievable.
2700 degrees Celsius at 40,000 feet?

23:44.799 --> 23:46.967
I know,
it sounds completely implausible.

23:47.135 --> 23:50.179
Nonetheless, we're ticking off
an increase of almost 0.5 percent.

23:50.680 --> 23:52.431
- Per day?
- No.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.640
Per hour.

23:53.808 --> 23:56.852
Dr. Helmsley. We've arrested
a group of tourists in the hot zone.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.354
Okay, I'll take care of it.

23:58.521 --> 24:01.148
Look, let's get Satnam
on the communications link.

24:01.316 --> 24:03.275
We'll try and cross-reference
the data.

24:03.443 --> 24:06.528
It's a national park. There's not
supposed to be posted fences.

24:06.696 --> 24:08.572
I mean, what's going on here?

24:08.740 --> 24:10.491
We're geologists.

24:11.201 --> 24:13.243
Do you usually go digging
with machine guns?

24:15.080 --> 24:17.081
Major, I'll take care of this.
Thank you.

24:17.248 --> 24:20.417
- What happened to the lake?
- That's what we're trying to find out.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.711
We think the entire area
has become unstable.

24:22.879 --> 24:25.923
I think you should take your kids
and leave, Mr. Curtis.

24:27.217 --> 24:29.593
You're not by any chance
the Jackson Curtis...

24:29.761 --> 24:32.137
...who wrote Farewell Atlantis,
are you?

24:34.683 --> 24:36.141
The very same.

24:37.268 --> 24:39.395
It's actually dedicated to my mom.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.563
That's great.

24:41.856 --> 24:45.651
I read a couple of your short stories
when I was in college. Yeah.

24:45.819 --> 24:48.487
You know,
your father is a very talented man.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.989
- Listen up.
- It's amazing. I'm reading your book.

24:51.157 --> 24:54.493
I'm around day 300, the shuttle has
just lost communication with Earth.

24:54.661 --> 24:56.578
You're one of the lucky few
who bought it.

24:56.746 --> 24:58.414
- I didn't buy it.
- No?

24:58.623 --> 25:00.249
My dad gave it to me.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.127
Let me ask you something.

25:04.212 --> 25:06.839
You believe those people
would behave so selflessly...

25:07.007 --> 25:09.133
...knowing that their own lives
were at stake?

25:09.300 --> 25:10.718
I hope so.

25:10.885 --> 25:14.179
The critics said I was naive,
an unabashed optimist...

25:14.347 --> 25:16.015
...but what do they know, right?

25:16.182 --> 25:17.349
Well...

25:17.767 --> 25:20.019
- Pleasure.
- It was a great pleasure meeting you.

25:20.603 --> 25:23.439
Major, could you escort these
good people to the campgrounds?

25:23.606 --> 25:24.773
This is yours.

25:24.941 --> 25:26.275
- Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

25:26.443 --> 25:27.443
- Take care.
- Okay.

25:27.694 --> 25:28.819
He was very nice.

25:28.987 --> 25:31.488
You're just saying that
because he liked my book.

25:36.745 --> 25:40.456
Looks like that boy of yours
is gonna be smarter than any of us.

25:45.086 --> 25:46.128
What's wrong?

25:46.296 --> 25:49.006
I sent Satnam
the temperature reading.

25:49.174 --> 25:53.052
My colleagues in Argentina and
Ontario have almost identical data.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.637
It's so hot here,
we've had to seal off the mine.

25:55.805 --> 25:58.474
- Double-checked the numbers?
- Triple-checked, my friend.

25:58.641 --> 26:00.976
I wish we were wrong...

26:01.311 --> 26:02.728
...but we're not.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.814
The Earth's crust is destabilizing.

26:10.987 --> 26:12.279
It's too early.

26:12.447 --> 26:15.991
Adrian,
you have to begin the evacuation.

26:17.744 --> 26:19.328
My God.

26:19.662 --> 26:23.290
All our scientific advances,
our fancy machines...

26:23.458 --> 26:26.335
The Mayans saw this coming
thousands of years ago.

26:35.428 --> 26:37.721
I thought we'd have more time.

26:45.814 --> 26:47.272
Okay.

26:47.732 --> 26:49.358
I want you to pack up your family.

26:49.526 --> 26:52.152
I'm gonna arrange an airlift for you
from Delhi.

26:52.320 --> 26:53.987
Thank you, my friend.

26:54.447 --> 26:55.781
And good luck.

27:04.874 --> 27:06.208
Ajit.

27:07.544 --> 27:09.378
We are going on a big ship.

27:13.049 --> 27:15.217
- That was so cool.
- Yeah, that was intense.

27:15.385 --> 27:17.553
- The helicopters.
- Craziest place I've seen.

27:17.721 --> 27:21.390
- Those helicopters were so cool.
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

27:21.558 --> 27:23.559
Wait. Sorry. One question:

27:24.352 --> 27:28.981
What did the government guys
say to you?

27:31.693 --> 27:34.737
Well, they don't like us
going over their fences...

27:35.363 --> 27:38.907
...and that the whole area
back there is unstable.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.744
Unstable. They said "unstable"?

27:41.911 --> 27:42.995
Yeah, unstable.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.915
That's funny.

27:47.083 --> 27:49.335
Let's go. Have a good one.

27:51.838 --> 27:54.173
Unstable.

27:59.095 --> 28:00.971
It's not just Yellowstone, sir.

28:01.139 --> 28:03.766
Temperatures are rising
with incredible velocity...

28:03.933 --> 28:05.517
...in hot zones across the globe.

28:05.685 --> 28:07.978
Are you absolutely sure
about this, Adrian?

28:08.146 --> 28:09.813
Because once we give
these orders...

28:09.981 --> 28:12.149
...there's no going back.
You understand that?

28:12.317 --> 28:15.235
I'm afraid there's no longer
any doubt, sir.

28:15.403 --> 28:19.782
We have to save what we can.
And we have to move now!

28:49.604 --> 28:52.898
There's mosquitoes in here.
Did anybody spray the tent?

28:53.817 --> 28:55.484
I'm gonna get that spray tomorrow.

28:55.652 --> 28:58.654
They just like you
because your blood's so sweet.

28:59.572 --> 29:02.241
Dad, you said you wouldn't work
on your book.

29:02.409 --> 29:05.869
What, Lil'bee? I'm not, I'm not.
I'm just... I'm doing something else.

29:06.371 --> 29:09.331
Let me get you ready for...
Ready for bed.

29:09.499 --> 29:11.166
Okay.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.671
Did you really need all these hats?

29:15.880 --> 29:18.590
- Where are your Pull-Ups, sweetie?
- I have them on.

29:26.182 --> 29:27.516
Who gave you this, Mommy?

29:27.684 --> 29:30.436
No, Gordon gave it to me
for my birthday.

29:30.603 --> 29:34.356
A cell phone is something we gotta
talk about, you know, as a family.

29:35.525 --> 29:36.692
What family?

29:41.114 --> 29:43.949
That hurts my feelings
when you say stuff like that.

29:46.161 --> 29:47.202
Just go away.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.292
Adults get...

29:54.878 --> 29:56.253
...hurt feelings too.

30:06.514 --> 30:08.015
We have a listener calling in.

30:08.183 --> 30:11.226
Bill from Cooke City,
you're on the Charlie Frost Show.

30:11.394 --> 30:13.437
Charlie, just wanted to say
I love your show.

30:13.605 --> 30:14.730
No way.

30:14.898 --> 30:16.523
...not afraid to tell the truth.

30:16.691 --> 30:18.525
Thank you, Bill.
What is your question?

30:18.693 --> 30:20.903
I wanted to know,
where is all this gonna start?

30:21.071 --> 30:24.406
Well, something like this could only
originate in Hollywood, Bill.

30:24.574 --> 30:27.117
They got the Earth
cracking under their asses already.

30:27.285 --> 30:30.204
Our family believes in the gospel
of the Lord Jesus.

30:30.372 --> 30:33.957
- We have nothing to fear, Charlie.
- Good for you, Bill. Thanks for calling.

30:34.125 --> 30:38.921
This is Charlie Frost reporting live
from Yellowstone National Park...

30:39.089 --> 30:44.176
...soon to become
the world's largest active volcano.

30:44.678 --> 30:46.595
I'll be right back, folks.

30:49.766 --> 30:52.643
Do you mind if I join you?
I wanted to ask you something.

30:52.811 --> 30:54.353
I only got a minute.

30:54.521 --> 30:56.355
Hey. Pickle?

30:56.731 --> 31:00.109
No. I was listening to the broadcast
and I was wondering...

31:00.276 --> 31:04.071
...what exactly is it
that's gonna start in Hollywood?

31:04.280 --> 31:06.115
It's the apocalypse.

31:06.282 --> 31:08.033
End of days.

31:08.201 --> 31:11.745
The Judgment Day,
the end of the world, my friend.

31:11.913 --> 31:15.374
Christians called it the rapture,
but the Mayans knew about it...

31:15.542 --> 31:18.794
...the Hopis, the I Ching...

31:19.004 --> 31:20.629
...the Bible, kind of...

31:21.798 --> 31:22.840
Beer?

31:23.633 --> 31:26.010
- Yeah.
- So look, I gotta eat.

31:26.177 --> 31:30.014
Why don't you download my blog.
It's free.

31:30.181 --> 31:33.475
Of course,
we do appreciate donations.

31:33.643 --> 31:37.813
In ancient times, the Mayan people
were the first civilization to discover...

31:38.023 --> 31:40.482
...that this planet had
an expiration date.

31:40.650 --> 31:42.151
According to their calendar...

31:42.318 --> 31:45.821
...in the year 2012,
a cataclysmic event will unfold...

31:45.989 --> 31:48.866
...caused by an alignment
of the planets in our solar system...

31:49.034 --> 31:53.162
...that only happens
every 640,000 years.

31:53.329 --> 31:54.997
Oh, not again.

31:55.165 --> 31:58.917
Pretty neat, huh?
I did all the animation myself.

31:59.461 --> 32:02.338
Just imagine the Earth
as an orange.

32:03.006 --> 32:07.217
You lure them in with humor.
Then you make them think.

32:07.385 --> 32:11.055
Our sun will begin to emit
such extreme amounts of radiation...

32:11.222 --> 32:13.432
Those little bastards
are called neutrinos.

32:13.600 --> 32:17.269
...that the core of the Earth will melt.
That's the inside part of the orange...

32:17.437 --> 32:20.606
...leaving the crust of our planet
free to shift.

32:20.774 --> 32:25.527
In 1958, Professor Charles Hapgood
named it Earth Crust Displacement.

32:25.695 --> 32:28.697
Albert Einstein did support it.

32:28.865 --> 32:30.032
People, we'll get it all.

32:30.200 --> 32:33.077
The forces of Mother Nature
will be so devastating...

32:33.244 --> 32:39.124
...it will bring an end to this world
on winter solstice, 12-21-12.

32:39.292 --> 32:43.379
Always remember, folks,
you heard it first from Charlie Frost.

32:44.130 --> 32:46.882
You'd have to keep a thing like this
under wraps.

32:47.092 --> 32:49.134
I mean, just think about it, okay?

32:49.302 --> 32:51.887
First, the stock market would go.

32:52.097 --> 32:54.348
Then the economy, boom!

32:54.516 --> 32:55.808
The dollar, boom!

32:55.975 --> 33:01.063
And then pandemonium in the streets.
War, genocide, boom, boom, boom!

33:01.648 --> 33:04.817
Bullshit. Nobody could keep
that big a secret, Charlie.

33:04.984 --> 33:07.736
- Somebody would blow the whistle.
- Every once in a while...

33:07.904 --> 33:09.905
...some poor little sucker tries.

33:10.115 --> 33:12.825
Well, like these guys, boom, boom!

33:12.992 --> 33:16.662
Every one of these guys,
dead, dead, dead.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.667
That's Professor Meyers.

33:21.835 --> 33:24.670
He ran the Atlantis shuttle program.
Why, did you know him?

33:24.838 --> 33:27.256
Yeah, he helped me
with research on my book.

33:27.424 --> 33:30.009
Well, that must have been
before his "accident. "

33:30.176 --> 33:31.301
Meyers is dead?

33:32.095 --> 33:34.221
Oh, yeah, two months ago.

33:34.389 --> 33:37.141
He was one
of my most avid listeners...

33:37.308 --> 33:39.268
...and he had it all figured out.

33:39.436 --> 33:42.771
Everything the government was doing,
where and why...

33:42.939 --> 33:45.149
He even sent me a map.

33:46.026 --> 33:49.236
A map for what, Charlie?
What's the map for?

33:55.410 --> 33:59.955
They're building spaceships, man.

34:05.879 --> 34:07.796
Shit, man, I have to go...

34:07.964 --> 34:11.257
...because I gotta get back to Earth.

34:11.426 --> 34:14.136
- But do you got a traveler for the road?
- This is my last...

34:14.304 --> 34:17.473
Oh, that'll be all right. But, anyway,
I really enjoyed most of this.

34:17.639 --> 34:18.806
Thank you so much.

34:18.975 --> 34:20.809
Hey. Hey, guess what.

34:20.976 --> 34:23.687
- They're selling seats.
- Put me down for three.

34:23.855 --> 34:25.981
No, guys like you and me
don't have a chance.

34:26.149 --> 34:28.609
You'd have to be Bill Gates
or Rupert Murdoch...

34:28.777 --> 34:30.777
...or some Russian billionaire
or something.

34:30.945 --> 34:32.654
Keep it down, my kids are sleeping.

34:32.822 --> 34:35.574
Get them out of Yellowstone.

34:35.742 --> 34:37.993
It's gonna get ugly here.

34:41.998 --> 34:44.166
Why don't we make a baby?

34:46.085 --> 34:48.712
We're not making a baby
in the supermarket.

34:49.297 --> 34:52.800
Hey, hands off the merchandise.

34:54.010 --> 34:57.471
Honey, women pay me thousands
of dollars to handle their boobs.

34:57.639 --> 34:58.847
You get it for free.

35:17.826 --> 35:19.993
You always act strange
after he shows up.

35:20.161 --> 35:23.372
I'm not acting strange.
I'm looking for the macaroni.

35:26.876 --> 35:28.669
So why did you
stick with him so long?

35:28.837 --> 35:31.964
Can we just give it a rest, please?
He's the father of my children.

35:32.132 --> 35:33.632
Oh, come on, Kate.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.968
You gave up med school
so you could have Noah.

35:36.136 --> 35:38.637
You practically raised
him and Lilly by yourself...

35:38.805 --> 35:40.514
...while he sat writing that junk.

35:40.682 --> 35:42.975
It's not junk. He's published.

35:43.143 --> 35:44.768
Oh, published, right, I forgot.

35:44.936 --> 35:47.396
Four hundred
and twenty-two copies.

36:01.786 --> 36:03.078
Did you see that?

36:03.246 --> 36:05.581
See what? Hey, Kate.

36:05.749 --> 36:09.668
Listen, we have to keep
working at this, our relationship.

36:09.836 --> 36:14.089
I mean, I don't know, honey. I just feel
like there's something pulling us apart.

36:17.761 --> 36:18.802
Gordon!

36:18.970 --> 36:20.596
Hang on! Hang onto the pole!

36:21.431 --> 36:22.681
Kate. Don't let go.

36:22.849 --> 36:24.099
- Oh, my God.
- Hang on!

36:24.267 --> 36:25.267
Gordon!

36:27.020 --> 36:29.104
Do you have anything
for mosquito bites?

36:29.272 --> 36:31.106
Before or after?

36:32.692 --> 36:34.026
I'd get before and after.

36:34.194 --> 36:36.945
Stop scratching.
You're gonna get it all infected.

36:37.113 --> 36:39.281
I had to make a stop
at the grocery store.

36:39.449 --> 36:42.326
It's Mrs. Birnbaum.
She's my teacher, she's on TV.

36:43.370 --> 36:46.538
Here is Grayson's Market, which
was open for business at the time...

36:46.706 --> 36:50.125
...but fortunately, there were
no fatalities or injuries reported.

36:50.293 --> 36:52.461
It really is a miracle
that no one got hurt.

36:53.421 --> 36:55.005
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

36:56.299 --> 36:59.051
Did you see what happened
to our supermarket?

37:01.388 --> 37:03.472
She wants us to come home.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.807
is this even possible?

37:04.974 --> 37:07.142
We worked every option
through the night.

37:07.310 --> 37:11.480
The good news, consensus is that four
of the arks will be operational in time.

37:11.648 --> 37:13.315
Only four? You call that good news?

37:13.483 --> 37:15.984
We can save over 400,000 people.

37:16.152 --> 37:18.237
To me, sir,
that's nothing short of a miracle.

37:18.405 --> 37:22.157
But we have to initiate
the boarding process now. Thomas.

37:22.575 --> 37:24.326
We don't have a choice.

37:24.494 --> 37:26.370
You have got to convince them.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.791
Listen, I'll try to keep this brief.

37:30.959 --> 37:34.003
According to the latest information
from Yellowsto...

37:34.170 --> 37:37.172
- Please continue, Adrian.
- Thank you, sir.

37:37.340 --> 37:39.717
The temperature
of the subterranean crust...

37:39.884 --> 37:43.637
...that is, the cement that holds
our land mass in place...

37:43.805 --> 37:47.099
...is increasing at a rapid rate,
much faster than anticipated.

37:47.267 --> 37:50.352
As a result, we've observed
extreme polar instability.

37:50.520 --> 37:53.313
The magnetic fields have decreased
by more than 80 percent...

37:53.481 --> 37:55.024
...in the last 48 hours.

37:55.191 --> 37:58.360
How much time do we have,
Dr. Helmsley?

38:00.488 --> 38:02.364
Two, maybe three days,
if we're lucky.

38:03.199 --> 38:06.869
How can you speak about luck
in such a situation?

38:07.037 --> 38:09.788
Apologies, Mr. Prime Minister. I...

38:10.874 --> 38:12.916
I meant no disrespect.

38:13.543 --> 38:18.088
I'm afraid the longer we wait,
the more luck plays its part.

38:23.887 --> 38:25.220
My friends...

38:26.556 --> 38:28.974
...I recommend
we evacuate immediately.

38:31.353 --> 38:34.271
If any of you have objections...

38:35.440 --> 38:36.982
...please speak now.

38:37.984 --> 38:39.568
In the blue corner...

38:41.237 --> 38:43.197
...38 victories, 34 knockouts...

38:43.365 --> 38:46.241
...the fighting machine
from the Ukraine...

38:46.409 --> 38:50.788
...the undefeated number-one ranked
heavyweight challenger:

38:50.955 --> 38:57.628
Mr. Zultan Balashin!

39:02.425 --> 39:05.010
- Yuri!
- Zultan!

39:05.178 --> 39:07.262
I feared you would not come.

39:07.430 --> 39:09.431
He needs to concentrate now,
Mr. Karpov.

39:09.599 --> 39:13.185
You shut up when I talk to my boy,
understand?

39:13.937 --> 39:15.270
Yes, Mr. Karpov.

39:15.438 --> 39:18.023
Good. That is good.

39:18.775 --> 39:20.442
Zultan, listen to me...

39:20.610 --> 39:23.612
...we are fighters,
we never go down...

39:24.489 --> 39:27.533
...no matter how hard they hit us.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.286
Kill the bastard.

39:31.788 --> 39:34.623
Kill the bastard, Zultan.

39:34.791 --> 39:37.167
Ladies and gentlemen...

39:37.335 --> 39:41.296
...let's get ready to rumble!

39:44.634 --> 39:46.468
Zultan!

40:14.164 --> 40:15.664
Yuri, where are you going?

40:18.501 --> 40:20.294
Yuri?

40:23.590 --> 40:27.343
One, two, three...

40:28.386 --> 40:31.722
Caltech believes that the half-mile
fissure running through Westwood...

40:31.890 --> 40:33.974
...has released
most of the surface tension.

40:34.142 --> 40:37.019
"Life will soon return to normal,"
Mayor Gonzales said...

40:37.187 --> 40:40.522
- ... at an early news conference.
- Okay, guys. Almost home.

40:42.609 --> 40:43.692
Rise and shine.

40:54.371 --> 40:56.330
All right, you're free.

40:57.832 --> 41:00.542
- Thank God.
- Mommy.

41:01.878 --> 41:03.712
Hi, sweetheart.

41:07.676 --> 41:09.093
Gordon!

41:10.303 --> 41:12.346
Hey, buddy boy.

41:13.264 --> 41:15.557
Good time? Yeah?

41:15.725 --> 41:17.393
God, I missed you.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.560
Yeah.

41:18.728 --> 41:21.105
- Who wants pancakes? Come on.
- Me.

41:25.402 --> 41:28.779
- Thanks for bringing them home early.
- Yeah.

41:29.739 --> 41:31.240
Pancakes?

41:32.867 --> 41:34.410
Late for work.

41:45.296 --> 41:48.007
- Yes, hello?
- Curtis, where are you?

41:48.174 --> 41:51.760
- Just getting back from vacation, sir.
- Good. That is good.

41:51.928 --> 41:54.304
I will send the jet
to pick up Alec and Oleg.

41:54.472 --> 41:57.433
Yuri bear, tell him to bring
the raincoat for Caesar.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.935
- It's in the Range Rover.
- Curtis.

42:00.103 --> 42:02.271
- Yeah?
- Get my boys as fast as you can.

42:02.439 --> 42:04.440
I'm hurtling towards you
as we speak, sir.

42:04.607 --> 42:05.816
Good. That is good.

42:21.291 --> 42:22.624
Curtis, you're late.

42:22.792 --> 42:24.668
Good morning to you too.

42:29.007 --> 42:31.967
Oh, be careful with our stuff.
Don't get your dirt on it.

42:32.302 --> 42:33.886
Idiot.

42:40.643 --> 42:42.394
Took you a while, Mr. Curtis.

42:46.608 --> 42:47.983
What's your problem?

42:48.151 --> 42:49.485
Be more careful.

42:49.652 --> 42:51.195
He did that on purpose.

42:51.363 --> 42:53.655
Hey, have a safe trip,
you little bastards.

42:54.491 --> 42:55.991
Now you're laughing, Curtis...

42:56.159 --> 42:58.160
...but we have tickets
to go on a big ship.

42:58.328 --> 42:59.912
We will live...

43:00.080 --> 43:02.206
...and you will die.

43:13.802 --> 43:15.678
Folks, did you hear that?

43:15.845 --> 43:20.265
The authorities in L.A.
say there's nothing to worry about.

43:20.433 --> 43:22.893
I'd love to see their dumb faces...

43:23.061 --> 43:25.521
...when Malibu and Beverly Hills...

43:25.689 --> 43:29.316
...get sucked into the gurgling maw
of the Pacific.

43:29.484 --> 43:32.528
Where they gonna plug in
their electric cars then?

43:36.449 --> 43:38.409
- Hey. is this your plane?
- Yes.

43:38.576 --> 43:40.035
- Are you a pilot?
- Yeah.

43:40.203 --> 43:42.079
I wanna rent it.
I'll give you anything.

43:42.247 --> 43:43.997
Here.
This is a very expensive watch.

43:44.165 --> 43:47.376
My editor gave it to me when
he thought I was gonna be somebody.

43:49.754 --> 43:53.424
I confirmed with my people at Caltech
that in the last 36 hours...

43:53.883 --> 43:58.137
...we had basically zero earthquake
activity in Southern California...

43:58.304 --> 44:01.098
...which is very rare.
Unlike many of the tough characters...

44:01.266 --> 44:03.600
- ... I've portrayed in my film career...
- Hello?

44:04.394 --> 44:05.936
- Stop what you're doing.
- Jackson?

44:06.104 --> 44:08.731
Listen to me. I've rented a plane.
Pack up the kids.

44:08.898 --> 44:11.567
- I'm gonna be there in five minutes.
- Plane? What?

44:11.735 --> 44:15.237
We're gonna do our regular Saturday.
Noah has music and Lil has karate.

44:15.405 --> 44:17.072
Not that we'd expect him
to remember.

44:17.240 --> 44:20.409
Kate, California is going down.
Pack up the kids now!

44:20.577 --> 44:22.244
They just got back.

44:22.412 --> 44:26.081
God, you sound like a crazy person.
The governorjust said we're fine now.

44:26.249 --> 44:29.084
The guy's an actor.
He's reading a script.

44:29.252 --> 44:31.003
When they tell you not to panic...

44:31.171 --> 44:32.838
...that's when you run!

44:33.006 --> 44:35.883
Okay, could you call me back
when you calm down?

44:36.426 --> 44:38.761
Mommy, why is Daddy so crazy?

44:38.928 --> 44:41.430
...taking the most severe hit
in Los Angeles.

44:41.598 --> 44:43.974
Finish your pancakes, Al Capone.

44:44.142 --> 44:48.020
It seems to me
that the worst is over.

44:50.065 --> 44:51.398
Mommy!

45:01.493 --> 45:03.494
Everyone hold on to each other.

45:03.661 --> 45:06.622
- No, Lilly!
- Hold Mommy's hand and stay close.

45:08.958 --> 45:10.042
Daddy!

45:10.210 --> 45:11.502
Let's go! Let's go!

45:11.670 --> 45:13.504
I think it's safer under here!

45:14.047 --> 45:17.633
Get in the fucking car right now!

45:17.801 --> 45:19.301
Move your ass! Move!

45:19.469 --> 45:20.761
- Come on, kids.
- Get up!

45:20.929 --> 45:22.638
- Move. Quick, quick!
- Move!

45:23.264 --> 45:25.474
Go! Now!

45:26.476 --> 45:28.811
- Come on, let's go.
- Run! Don't look back!

45:28.978 --> 45:31.146
- Come on!
- Take her! Get in, honey, get in.

45:32.607 --> 45:34.108
My hats.

45:35.694 --> 45:37.361
Lilly, get in!

45:38.446 --> 45:39.488
Get in!

45:39.656 --> 45:41.907
- Buckle up!
- Lilly.

45:49.958 --> 45:51.333
Sorry.

46:04.681 --> 46:06.724
Jackson, hurry up. Look behind you.

46:08.226 --> 46:10.102
- Holy...!
- Oh, God.

46:14.858 --> 46:16.608
Get out of herw!
Get out of the way!

46:16.776 --> 46:19.361
- Move it!
- Hold on to those eggs, dear.

46:19.529 --> 46:21.530
- Come on!
- Come on, you old bags!

46:23.616 --> 46:25.367
Sidewalk, sidewalk! Tree! Tree!

46:27.537 --> 46:29.538
God. Carwful.

46:33.043 --> 46:34.418
Everybody, hang on.

46:37.964 --> 46:39.131
Oh, my God.

46:39.299 --> 46:40.758
Careful, careful.

46:45.221 --> 46:46.555
Yikes. That stinks.

46:52.645 --> 46:54.480
We gotta get to the airport.

46:54.647 --> 46:56.940
Well, take the freeway,
it'll be half the time.

47:00.070 --> 47:01.653
Yeah, right.

47:07.911 --> 47:09.411
Jesus.

47:10.789 --> 47:13.415
We gotta get to the other side
of the freeway.

47:14.417 --> 47:16.043
Daddy!

47:27.847 --> 47:30.849
- Dad, look!
- No. We're not gonna make it! Careful!

47:39.109 --> 47:41.110
- No, Daddy!
- Dad, look. Dad, look.

47:42.779 --> 47:44.029
No, no, no!

47:56.960 --> 47:59.461
It's been upgraded to a 10.9
by the guys at Harvard.

47:59.629 --> 48:01.130
What does Caltech have to say?

48:01.297 --> 48:05.467
The whole city of Pasadena
was wiped out just a few minutes ago.

48:05.635 --> 48:08.595
This is coming in from Coachella
Valley out near Joshua Tree.

48:08.763 --> 48:10.889
That canyon?
That wasn't there this morning.

48:11.057 --> 48:15.060
And 400 miles further north,
Point Reyes, same thing.

48:16.646 --> 48:18.605
The San Andreas Fault is shifting.

48:18.773 --> 48:21.483
Yes. And all major sister faults
in the Bay Area.

48:21.985 --> 48:25.487
The whole Pacific plate
is destabilizing.

48:31.661 --> 48:33.537
Hold my hand. Stay close to me.

48:34.748 --> 48:36.165
Come on!

48:36.332 --> 48:38.208
- Who's that?
- Our pilot!

48:38.376 --> 48:41.003
Oh, jeez. It's our pilot.

48:41.171 --> 48:43.088
Gordon. Gordon, you can fly.

48:43.256 --> 48:46.717
No, no, I've only had a couple of
lessons in a single-engine plane only.

48:46.885 --> 48:48.510
- You're the guy.
- I am not the guy.

48:48.678 --> 48:52.556
- Trust me, you're the guy.
- I'm not being modest about this.

48:52.724 --> 48:55.017
Come on, kids.
Gordon's gonna get us out of here.

48:55.185 --> 48:57.353
That plane has multiple engines.

48:58.563 --> 49:00.356
Jackson!

49:15.413 --> 49:17.206
- T's and P's, T's and P's.
- T and P?

49:17.374 --> 49:19.041
- Temperatures and pressures.
- Go!

49:19.209 --> 49:21.794
- I've gotta do my preflight check.
- Let him concentrate.

49:21.961 --> 49:23.295
He has no experience.

49:23.463 --> 49:24.880
Thank you.

49:26.383 --> 49:27.883
- Gordon, go.
- Come on.

49:28.051 --> 49:30.094
- Gordon!
- Go, go, go!

49:32.555 --> 49:34.973
- We're not there yet.
- Gordon, take off.

49:36.059 --> 49:38.268
- Punch it, punch it!
- I have to get to 85 knots.

49:38.436 --> 49:41.063
- Eighty's good.
- Oh, screw it. Here we go.

49:45.944 --> 49:47.945
Okay. Okay, we're up.

49:57.122 --> 49:58.831
Higher, higher!

50:35.660 --> 50:37.453
Oh, my God.

51:04.731 --> 51:06.648
Lilly, go sit with your brother.

51:11.488 --> 51:14.323
I don't understand. How did you know
this was gonna happen?

51:14.991 --> 51:17.034
It is not just California.

51:17.202 --> 51:19.912
It's the whole goddamn world
that's going to shit.

51:20.080 --> 51:22.206
I met this guy in Yellowstone,
this crazy guy.

51:22.374 --> 51:25.042
He's been right about everything
that's happened so far.

51:25.210 --> 51:27.503
And he said the government
is building spaceships.

51:27.671 --> 51:29.838
- I don't know what, but something.
- Ships?

51:30.006 --> 51:31.840
Yeah, places where we can be safe.

51:32.300 --> 51:34.843
He knows where they are.
He's got a map.

51:35.011 --> 51:36.345
Jackson.

51:36.513 --> 51:38.639
Kate, you gotta just trust me on this,
okay?

51:38.807 --> 51:41.350
Guys, look.

52:03.998 --> 52:07.209
There's a twist and a turn
To each lesson you learn

52:07.377 --> 52:10.713
First you're up, then you're bust
Livin' life on a crust

52:10.880 --> 52:14.049
But it ain't the end of the world, buddy

52:14.217 --> 52:17.052
It's only the end of this song

52:17.220 --> 52:20.639
It's been a gas, been a flip
Been a hell of a trip

52:20.807 --> 52:25.728
But it ain't the end of the world

52:26.938 --> 52:28.397
Oh, yeah.

52:28.565 --> 52:29.648
Thank you.

52:29.816 --> 52:31.066
You got fans, Tony.

52:33.236 --> 52:35.821
There's a call for you.
You want me to take a message?

52:35.989 --> 52:38.032
No, that's all right, Kevin. I got it.

52:43.371 --> 52:45.414
- Hello.
- Dad?

52:45.582 --> 52:46.915
Adrian.

52:47.083 --> 52:50.669
Remember when I told you
about that dam in China?

52:50.837 --> 52:52.129
Yeah.

52:52.297 --> 52:54.089
It's happening, Dad.

53:02.932 --> 53:07.144
They'd probably shoot me
if they knew that I told you.

53:08.229 --> 53:11.440
Nobody's gonna shoot you, son.
They need you.

53:11.608 --> 53:15.235
The president has ordered us
to clear out the White House.

53:15.403 --> 53:17.946
About time somebody cleaned up
that mess.

53:21.117 --> 53:22.534
Where are you, Dad?

53:23.078 --> 53:26.246
What exactly is the course
of the Genesis right now?

53:26.414 --> 53:28.791
It's all good, Adrian.

53:28.958 --> 53:31.960
Don't you be worrying
about your old man now.

53:32.128 --> 53:35.130
You got more important things
to do now.

53:37.509 --> 53:39.134
You know...

53:40.011 --> 53:41.970
...your mom and I, we...

53:42.472 --> 53:45.349
We had one hell of a great life, son.

53:47.143 --> 53:50.604
And the best part about that...

53:51.648 --> 53:54.483
...is we had
one hell of a great kid too.

53:57.654 --> 53:59.154
Now, you lookie here.

54:00.156 --> 54:01.198
The Genesis...

54:01.366 --> 54:03.826
...it's a pretty big ship, son.

54:04.327 --> 54:08.497
So don't you write your old man off
just yet.

54:08.665 --> 54:09.665
Besides...

54:11.459 --> 54:14.420
...you know I couldn't leave
Tony alone.

54:14.587 --> 54:19.091
You know that old fool
can't keep decent time by himself.

54:20.844 --> 54:23.178
I love you, Dad.

54:28.435 --> 54:30.644
I love you too, son.

54:30.812 --> 54:32.938
God knows I do.

54:45.994 --> 54:48.287
Kevin, I want a double.

54:49.873 --> 54:52.666
- Harry.
- I need a double right now.

54:56.796 --> 54:58.380
Thank you, son.

55:01.551 --> 55:05.929
After 25 years on the wagon,
are you out of your mind?

55:21.988 --> 55:23.405
- What are you doing?
- Gotta go.

55:23.573 --> 55:26.575
- That's against regulation.
- Careful, careful.

55:30.914 --> 55:32.414
- Anything?
- Yeah, there's fuel.

55:32.582 --> 55:34.333
Fill it up. I'm gonna find Charlie.

55:34.501 --> 55:36.168
Daddy, wait. I wanna come with you.

55:36.336 --> 55:39.254
- No, no. Lil. Lil, no!
- It's all right. Just fill it up.

55:39.422 --> 55:41.423
- We'll be back.
- Jackson, hurry, please.

55:41.925 --> 55:44.927
I'm standing here
at the highest point...

55:45.095 --> 55:50.057
...of what is the rim of the world's
largest super-volcano...

55:50.225 --> 55:56.146
- ... Mount Bighorn, elevation 2779 feet.
- Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

55:57.107 --> 56:01.527
I can only hope that all of you
have made your peace with God...

56:01.695 --> 56:04.029
- He's gotta be around somewhere.
- Let's go back.

56:04.197 --> 56:06.865
No, no, no. We gotta find Charlie
because he's got a map.

56:07.033 --> 56:09.326
It's like a secret map,
like in the Pirate movies.

56:09.494 --> 56:11.286
- We gotta work as a team, okay?
- Okay.

56:11.454 --> 56:13.122
Okay, come on.

56:13.289 --> 56:16.125
Call Mommy and tell her
we're gonna be 5 minutes late.

56:20.964 --> 56:22.965
- Hello?
- I need to talk to Mommy.

56:23.133 --> 56:25.300
- It's Lilly.
- Sweetheart, where are you?

56:25.468 --> 56:28.012
- Hi, Mommy.
- Let me speak to Daddy, sweetie.

56:28.179 --> 56:31.223
He can't talk right now.
He's driving really, really bad.

56:33.226 --> 56:35.853
Any minute now,
the fireworks are gonna start.

56:36.021 --> 56:37.813
Who is that?
Who's speaking in the car?

56:37.981 --> 56:41.025
He's not in the car. He's on
a mountain waiting for fireworks.

56:41.192 --> 56:44.319
- Fireworks? What fireworks?
- Daddy. Daddy, over there.

56:44.487 --> 56:47.031
...to send all of Yellowstone
into outer space?

56:47.198 --> 56:48.490
Good job, Lilly. Good job.

56:50.660 --> 56:52.161
Let me talk to Mom.

56:52.328 --> 56:55.581
- Kate, we got him.
- Jackson, bring back my child now.

56:59.002 --> 57:02.004
Okay. You stay here
and guard the ship...

57:02.172 --> 57:04.882
- ... and I'm gonna go talk to the pirate.
- Okay.

57:05.050 --> 57:07.718
...your race, your country, your god.

57:07.886 --> 57:12.598
Whether you're a Christian or
a Buddhist or Muslim or Rastafarian...

57:12.766 --> 57:16.018
- ... by tomorrow we will all be one!
- Charlie.

57:16.186 --> 57:18.062
- Jackson. What are you doing here?
- Yeah.

57:18.229 --> 57:21.065
- I thought you were toast.
- No. Where are the spaceships?

57:21.232 --> 57:23.359
There's no way
you can make it there.

57:23.526 --> 57:27.571
We have a plane. You could come
with us, but we gotta leave right now.

57:35.413 --> 57:38.040
Fly, birdies.

57:38.208 --> 57:40.042
Fly!

57:40.210 --> 57:41.794
is this your kid?

57:42.712 --> 57:43.962
Where's the goddamn map?

57:44.130 --> 57:46.048
- We're going live.
- Where is it?

57:46.216 --> 57:48.967
Charlie. Focus. Where's the map?
Where?

57:49.135 --> 57:50.219
It's in the camper.

57:50.387 --> 57:51.428
Where in the camper?

57:51.596 --> 57:54.932
In the map section
on the conspiracy shelf.

57:55.100 --> 57:57.017
Dewey decimal system.

57:57.185 --> 57:59.603
Between Roswell...

57:59.771 --> 58:02.898
...and Marilyn Monroe.

58:11.241 --> 58:13.283
It's starting.

58:21.251 --> 58:23.752
You sure you don't wanna come with,
man?

58:23.920 --> 58:27.381
It's so beautiful. I'm gonna stay.

58:28.299 --> 58:29.883
Good luck.

58:33.096 --> 58:38.600
This marks the last day
of the United States of America.

58:39.936 --> 58:43.272
And, by tomorrow, all of mankind.

58:43.440 --> 58:45.941
And we will be visible
from the Milky Way...

58:46.109 --> 58:48.819
...as a tiny little puff of smoke.

58:49.446 --> 58:53.991
I'm watching the earth crumble
before my eyes.

58:54.951 --> 59:00.539
The giant ash cloud
created by this super-volcano...

59:00.707 --> 59:02.791
...will first envelop Vegas...

59:03.293 --> 59:04.793
...and then St. Louis...

59:05.462 --> 59:07.463
...and then Chicago...

59:07.630 --> 59:09.673
...and then, at long last...

59:09.841 --> 59:14.303
...Washington, D.C.
will have its lights go out!

59:14.471 --> 59:17.473
- That guy's crazy, right, Daddy?
- I don't think so.

59:20.352 --> 59:21.810
This is ridiculous.

59:21.978 --> 59:24.563
Been over half an hour.
I tell you, the guy's a nut job.

59:24.731 --> 59:26.315
Stop it, Gordon.

59:26.483 --> 59:28.400
Noah, hand me the phone again.

59:50.507 --> 59:52.549
Daddy, what was that?

59:53.551 --> 59:56.011
Nothing. Nothing.

59:56.471 --> 59:59.348
I have goose bumps, people.

01:00:21.538 --> 01:00:24.415
I wish you could see
what I'm seeing, people.

01:00:24.582 --> 01:00:27.126
I wish you could be here with me!

01:00:27.836 --> 01:00:30.212
Oh, baby.

01:00:31.214 --> 01:00:33.215
Bring it on!

01:00:33.383 --> 01:00:35.050
Always remember, folks...

01:00:35.885 --> 01:00:39.096
...you heard it first from Charlie!

01:00:55.030 --> 01:00:56.405
Daddy, it's following us.

01:00:56.573 --> 01:00:58.073
Don't look! Get on the ground.

01:00:58.241 --> 01:01:00.409
Get on the ground and hold on.
Don't look back.

01:01:00.577 --> 01:01:03.620
Don't look back. Just look at me.
Look at me. Do I look scared?

01:01:08.835 --> 01:01:10.961
Now, hold on, baby. Hold on tight.

01:01:18.303 --> 01:01:19.762
Daddy, we're on fire.

01:01:28.438 --> 01:01:30.272
There it is! There they are.

01:01:35.695 --> 01:01:36.987
It's them.

01:01:37.155 --> 01:01:39.198
It's them. It's them.

01:01:40.617 --> 01:01:41.700
Mommy!

01:01:45.372 --> 01:01:46.789
Jeez.

01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:55.798
- No, Daddy.
- Hang on, baby. Hang on!

01:01:58.843 --> 01:02:00.010
No, Daddy!

01:02:09.145 --> 01:02:10.479
Oh, my Go...

01:02:10.814 --> 01:02:13.357
- Mommy.
- Take her, take her. I'll be right back.

01:02:19.989 --> 01:02:23.033
- Come here, Lil. Grab my hand.
- Come on, Lil. Lilly, you okay?

01:02:23.201 --> 01:02:25.536
Aliens, Roswell
and Marilyn Monroe...

01:02:25.704 --> 01:02:27.246
Maps! Maps!

01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:30.582
- Everybody on? Are we ready?
- Jackson!

01:02:33.712 --> 01:02:36.672
- Kate, where is he? What's he doing?
- I don't know.

01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:41.427
No!

01:02:49.769 --> 01:02:51.603
- Daddy!
- No!

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:58.027
- Oh, my God.
- Kate, we have to go.

01:02:58.194 --> 01:02:59.778
No. We're not going anywhere.

01:02:59.946 --> 01:03:03.824
- Kids, buckle up, we're leaving.
- This is my dad. We're gonna wait.

01:03:08.705 --> 01:03:10.456
No!

01:03:10.623 --> 01:03:12.207
Daddy!

01:03:15.712 --> 01:03:18.630
Wait!
Wait, Gordon, I see something.

01:03:18.798 --> 01:03:20.382
Dad!

01:03:24.929 --> 01:03:26.138
It's Daddy!

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.894
Slow down!

01:03:32.062 --> 01:03:33.062
Jackson, run!

01:03:34.064 --> 01:03:36.565
Jackson, take my hand. Jackson.

01:03:36.733 --> 01:03:38.942
- Dad, hurry!
- Run!

01:03:39.819 --> 01:03:42.905
We're running out of runway.
For God's sakes, Kate, pull him up.

01:03:43.073 --> 01:03:46.617
- Jackson, reach for my hand.
- Dad, you can make it, come on.

01:03:46.785 --> 01:03:48.452
Daddy!

01:03:52.582 --> 01:03:54.583
All right, buckle in. Here we go!

01:03:55.669 --> 01:03:57.336
Come on, faster. Faster.

01:04:17.273 --> 01:04:18.816
Hang on.

01:04:21.152 --> 01:04:22.986
- Go faster.
- I'm trying.

01:04:39.796 --> 01:04:41.797
Okay. We're good!

01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:44.800
- We're good.
- We're okay.

01:04:48.179 --> 01:04:51.306
So now that you got your map,
where are we going?

01:05:02.652 --> 01:05:04.737
We're gonna need a bigger plane.

01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:14.663
No, you just said that, Mom.
Yeah, you just said that.

01:05:14.831 --> 01:05:16.832
You don't remember
that you just said that?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.210
That's okay. That's okay.

01:05:20.378 --> 01:05:24.506
Listen, Ma, I am going to call you
next week, same time.

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:26.258
Okay?

01:05:26.426 --> 01:05:28.677
You take care now.
Take care of yourself.

01:05:32.182 --> 01:05:33.766
Sir?

01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:36.685
I think you need to see this.

01:05:41.858 --> 01:05:44.401
I thought for sure
they'd give you an extra ticket, sir.

01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:45.903
They did.

01:05:46.071 --> 01:05:48.739
But my mother is almost 89...

01:05:48.907 --> 01:05:51.867
...she's in a wheelchair,
and she's easily confused.

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:54.828
And I am confident that she
would want to meet her maker...

01:05:54.996 --> 01:05:56.747
...on her own terms, okay?

01:05:56.915 --> 01:05:58.707
Yes, sir. Who are you bringing?

01:05:58.875 --> 01:06:02.419
Nobody. Who, my ex-wife?
Last thing she said to me...

01:06:02.587 --> 01:06:04.880
...she never wanted to see me again.
So be it.

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:07.049
We need to bring people
who can contribute.

01:06:07.217 --> 01:06:09.385
The South American continent
has been ravaged...

01:06:09.552 --> 01:06:11.261
...by a series of major earthquakes.

01:06:11.429 --> 01:06:14.515
The death toll is expected
to be well over 2 million people.

01:06:14.683 --> 01:06:17.935
The devastation in Rio de Janeiro
is beyond imagination.

01:06:18.103 --> 01:06:21.105
Two 8.5 tremors have left
the people in the streets...

01:06:21.272 --> 01:06:23.899
...desperately fighting
for the last remaining resources.

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:28.362
In the last hour, we received this video from Globo News, Brazil.

01:06:34.911 --> 01:06:37.955
Fear and chaos have spread
throughout the globe, as in London...

01:06:38.123 --> 01:06:40.958
...where the 30th Olympic Games
have just been suspended.

01:06:41.126 --> 01:06:44.044
Hundreds of thousands are marching
towards 10 Downing Street...

01:06:44.212 --> 01:06:47.006
...demanding a lift
of the information blackout.

01:06:47.173 --> 01:06:49.758
We've had thousands of calls.
We had to shut it down.

01:06:49.926 --> 01:06:52.511
We're receiving reports
from all across the globe.

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:54.930
Millions upon millions
of distraught masses...

01:06:55.098 --> 01:06:58.308
...are gathering in public places,
converging in desperate prayer.

01:06:58.476 --> 01:07:00.561
Preachers of many
religious denominations...

01:07:00.729 --> 01:07:02.646
...have taken their message
of the end...

01:07:02.814 --> 01:07:04.440
...to the strwets all over the U.S.

01:07:04.607 --> 01:07:06.942
Repent. There is still time.

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:10.988
Kind of galling when you realize that
nutbags with their signs had it right.

01:07:11.156 --> 01:07:13.282
All these people out there, sir...

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:15.284
...shouldn't we be
issuing warnings now?

01:07:15.452 --> 01:07:18.287
Only when the boarding process
is complete. That's the plan.

01:07:18.455 --> 01:07:21.457
- British Columbia, 2010, remember?
- Sir.

01:07:21.624 --> 01:07:23.834
Sir, those plans were drawn up
two years ago.

01:07:24.002 --> 01:07:27.463
Okay. Everybody out.
Go on, get out.

01:07:27.630 --> 01:07:28.672
Mary, get the door.

01:07:29.549 --> 01:07:31.675
Wasn't it decided
that people have the right...

01:07:31.843 --> 01:07:33.969
...to fight for their lives
best way they can?

01:07:34.137 --> 01:07:36.472
After we get everyone on board,
Adrian.

01:07:36.639 --> 01:07:37.681
I think that's wrong.

01:07:37.849 --> 01:07:41.602
Wha...? Just wanna tell everyone
they're doomed?

01:07:41.770 --> 01:07:42.895
There'd be anarchy.

01:07:43.646 --> 01:07:46.315
- You wanna jeopardize the president?
- Come on.

01:07:46.483 --> 01:07:51.236
Our mission is to assurw
the continuity of our species.

01:07:51.988 --> 01:07:55.366
My question: Can I count on you?

01:07:55.533 --> 01:07:56.909
Can I?

01:07:57.577 --> 01:07:58.786
What?

01:07:58.953 --> 01:08:00.579
The Yellowstone caldera
has erupted.

01:08:00.747 --> 01:08:04.375
The ash cloud will reach Washington
in roughly seven hours.

01:08:05.335 --> 01:08:07.670
We've got to get
the government airborne.

01:08:08.380 --> 01:08:09.713
Where's the president, Sally?

01:08:09.881 --> 01:08:12.841
Said he wanted some time alone.
I think he's over at the chapel.

01:08:13.009 --> 01:08:15.386
- He's gotta go to church now?
- He's praying, sir.

01:08:15.553 --> 01:08:18.263
Which, under the circumstances,
is not such a bad idea.

01:08:21.975 --> 01:08:23.519
Mr. President.

01:08:23.687 --> 01:08:26.604
I need to get you on Air Force One
immediately.

01:08:28.399 --> 01:08:29.733
Give me a moment with Adrian.

01:08:29.901 --> 01:08:32.027
No disrespect,
but we simply do not have time.

01:08:32.194 --> 01:08:33.612
Make time.

01:08:46.209 --> 01:08:49.169
Did you ever meet my wife,
Dorothy?

01:08:49.337 --> 01:08:52.548
No, sir. I didn't have that honor.

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:56.426
She was in and out of it
towards the end.

01:08:57.261 --> 01:09:01.265
The night before she passed on,
she took my hand and she told me:

01:09:01.433 --> 01:09:05.102
"I think you should have a lottery.

01:09:06.104 --> 01:09:09.732
Everyone should
have a chance to go. "

01:09:12.402 --> 01:09:14.236
Maybe that's what
we should have done.

01:09:17.907 --> 01:09:22.368
I'll be the last president
of the United States of America.

01:09:22.537 --> 01:09:24.580
Do you know how that feels, son?

01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:28.625
No one could have
saved the country, sir.

01:09:29.961 --> 01:09:31.420
And I think...

01:09:32.087 --> 01:09:34.590
I think people have a right to know.

01:09:35.425 --> 01:09:38.093
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

01:09:39.929 --> 01:09:41.305
Go on now.

01:09:43.099 --> 01:09:44.933
Not without you, sir.

01:09:45.685 --> 01:09:48.103
You get on that plane, son.

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:52.649
It's a brave new world
you're heading to.

01:09:52.817 --> 01:09:58.030
And a young scientist
is gonna be worth 20 old politicians.

01:10:16.508 --> 01:10:18.801
We should go to my parents' house
in the Rockies.

01:10:18.968 --> 01:10:23.138
This isn't one of your crazy stories.
How are we gonna make it to China?

01:10:23.306 --> 01:10:26.642
Gordon, without Jackson, we wouldn't
have made it out of California.

01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:28.310
Noah, please.

01:10:35.819 --> 01:10:38.320
You, be careful
with the landing gear.

01:10:38.488 --> 01:10:40.823
Easy, gringo. I know what I doing.

01:10:40.990 --> 01:10:43.492
Attention. The National Guard
has informed us...

01:10:43.660 --> 01:10:45.619
...that an extremely hazardous
ash cloud...

01:10:45.787 --> 01:10:47.204
...is headed for Las Vegas.

01:10:47.372 --> 01:10:48.664
Hey, where are you going?

01:10:48.832 --> 01:10:51.333
Everyone move indoors
immediately.

01:10:51.501 --> 01:10:53.711
- Sir, you can't stay here.
- I have plane here.

01:10:53.878 --> 01:10:55.087
It's not safe. Move it!

01:10:56.047 --> 01:10:57.089
Move it!

01:11:06.224 --> 01:11:08.767
So you have
positive confirmation on this?

01:11:10.228 --> 01:11:12.021
Thank you, I understand.

01:11:22.782 --> 01:11:24.533
President's not coming.

01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:31.040
So...

01:11:31.207 --> 01:11:35.711
...the captain doesn't want to abandon
his sinking ship.

01:11:35.879 --> 01:11:37.296
That's his choice.

01:11:37.464 --> 01:11:39.548
And a noble one.

01:11:39.716 --> 01:11:43.093
I have also just learned
that the vice-president's chopper...

01:11:43.261 --> 01:11:45.804
...went down in the ash cloud
outside of Pittsburgh.

01:11:47.390 --> 01:11:50.642
Fortunately,
we have protocols to follow.

01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:52.728
What about
the Speaker of the House?

01:11:52.896 --> 01:11:56.231
- I have no idea. Where is he?
- He's the commander in chief now, sir.

01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:59.735
This is one flight
he shouldn't have been late for.

01:11:59.903 --> 01:12:02.988
- Tell the captain we're taking off.
- You don't have the authority.

01:12:03.156 --> 01:12:05.240
Who's got authority?
You've got the authority?

01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:07.284
You couldn't
even keep your mouth shut.

01:12:07.452 --> 01:12:09.828
You betrayed top-secret information
last year.

01:12:09.996 --> 01:12:12.456
- What are you talking about?
- You told your father...

01:12:12.624 --> 01:12:13.957
...put this plan in jeopardy.

01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:17.002
Good thing for you the old man
could keep his mouth shut.

01:12:17.170 --> 01:12:19.171
Oh, come on.
Don't look so shocked.

01:12:19.339 --> 01:12:22.424
We had to monitor everybody.
How do you think we kept it a secret?

01:12:22.592 --> 01:12:24.927
We just killed anybody
who tried to talk?

01:12:25.095 --> 01:12:26.428
Anybody who tried to talk...

01:12:26.596 --> 01:12:29.390
...was not just an enemy of the state,
they're an enemy of humanity.

01:12:29.557 --> 01:12:31.809
The director of the Louvre,
an enemy of humanity?

01:12:31.976 --> 01:12:33.977
After he called a press conference
he was!

01:12:35.063 --> 01:12:37.022
Jesus. What did you think?

01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:41.276
We're all just gonna get on board,
hold hands and sing "Kumbaya"?

01:12:41.861 --> 01:12:43.779
Sit down and buckle up.

01:12:53.164 --> 01:12:56.083
Oh, excuse me.
is my father in the command center?

01:12:56.251 --> 01:12:58.669
President's on the line, Dr. Wilson.

01:12:59.963 --> 01:13:01.380
Thank you.

01:13:08.013 --> 01:13:09.179
Where are you?

01:13:09.347 --> 01:13:13.308
You never would have gotten
on that plane if I told you.

01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:17.021
But you said that you'd be...

01:13:17.188 --> 01:13:18.897
Darling, listen to me.

01:13:19.065 --> 01:13:21.734
Do you understand
how much strength it gives me...

01:13:21.901 --> 01:13:24.069
...knowing that you'll survive?

01:13:25.447 --> 01:13:27.990
The only thing left to do now...

01:13:28.825 --> 01:13:31.452
...is tell the truth to people.

01:13:32.287 --> 01:13:34.580
At least if they know...

01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:40.336
...families can say goodbye
to each other.

01:13:41.004 --> 01:13:44.381
A mother can comfort her children.

01:13:46.301 --> 01:13:48.177
And a father...

01:13:50.347 --> 01:13:53.265
...can ask his daughter
for forgiveness.

01:14:02.359 --> 01:14:04.860
Whenever you're ready,
Mr. President.

01:14:13.119 --> 01:14:15.329
My fellow Americans...

01:14:16.039 --> 01:14:19.375
...this will be the last time
I address you.

01:14:20.126 --> 01:14:21.418
As you know...

01:14:22.170 --> 01:14:25.422
...catastrophe has struck
our nation...

01:14:26.591 --> 01:14:28.717
...has struck the world.

01:14:28.885 --> 01:14:30.719
I wish I could tell you...

01:14:31.262 --> 01:14:34.390
...we could prevent
the coming destruction.

01:14:34.849 --> 01:14:36.475
We cannot.

01:14:37.310 --> 01:14:39.603
Today, none of us are strangers.

01:14:41.064 --> 01:14:42.231
Today...

01:14:42.399 --> 01:14:47.611
...we are one family
stepping into the darkness together.

01:14:47.779 --> 01:14:50.989
We are a nation of many religions...

01:14:51.157 --> 01:14:57.329
...but I believe these words
reflect the spirit of all of our faiths:

01:14:58.164 --> 01:15:01.291
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall...

01:15:02.585 --> 01:15:05.921
People! Keep away
from the doors and windows.

01:15:06.089 --> 01:15:08.257
What are we gonna do?
Where are we gonna go?

01:15:08.425 --> 01:15:09.633
Dr. Silberman.

01:15:10.844 --> 01:15:12.845
- Tamara.
- What are you doing here?

01:15:13.013 --> 01:15:15.681
- Excuse me.
- She's a patient, honey.

01:15:15.849 --> 01:15:18.642
Excuse me,
I have a private plane out there.

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:20.102
- Karpov!
- We need help.

01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:21.687
- Yuri!
- Takeoffs are canceled.

01:15:21.855 --> 01:15:24.481
- Curtis, you're...
- You knew. This whole time you knew.

01:15:24.649 --> 01:15:27.526
So you've got a way out of here, right?
You got a plane?

01:15:27.694 --> 01:15:29.820
My family, take us with.
Please. Please.

01:15:29.988 --> 01:15:31.780
Boss. Boss.

01:15:31.948 --> 01:15:33.907
I found us a plane, an Antonov.

01:15:34.075 --> 01:15:36.785
They were about to take off,
but the tower didn't let them.

01:15:36.953 --> 01:15:39.204
But can you still fly that thing?

01:15:39.372 --> 01:15:42.166
Sure, boss. But I need copilot.

01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:45.294
Gordon's a pilot.

01:15:46.254 --> 01:15:47.880
No, I'm not. I'm not.

01:15:48.048 --> 01:15:50.049
Yes, he is. Great pilot. Let's go.

01:15:51.468 --> 01:15:52.634
Good. Let's go!

01:15:52.802 --> 01:15:55.554
Honey, this is...
Jackson, stop saying I'm a pilot.

01:15:55.722 --> 01:15:58.057
Hey! Hey, stop!

01:15:58.266 --> 01:16:00.642
You can't go out there. Come back!

01:16:05.899 --> 01:16:07.483
Move back, people.

01:16:07.692 --> 01:16:09.151
Get away from the glass!

01:16:13.823 --> 01:16:15.824
Wow, that's a big plane.

01:16:16.993 --> 01:16:18.827
It's Russian.

01:16:19.496 --> 01:16:21.330
- Let's move, everybody. Come on.
- Run!

01:16:21.498 --> 01:16:23.832
- Yeah, let's go, let's go.
- Boys, come on.

01:16:27.003 --> 01:16:28.921
- Gordon, where are you?
- Where did you go?

01:16:29.089 --> 01:16:32.049
I'm up here in the cockpit.
Hurry up.

01:16:32.801 --> 01:16:34.843
Oh, my God. Not again.

01:16:42.852 --> 01:16:44.311
Whoa, look at these.

01:16:44.479 --> 01:16:46.855
Las Vegas Auto Show.

01:16:47.023 --> 01:16:49.191
We had VIP tickets for that.

01:16:49.609 --> 01:16:51.068
That's fantastic. Let's go.

01:16:51.236 --> 01:16:54.154
Check the main bus for hydraulics,
I'll balance the tanks.

01:16:54.322 --> 01:16:55.656
What?

01:16:57.242 --> 01:16:59.910
Okay, okay, okay. I'm trying, okay?
I'm trying.

01:17:01.371 --> 01:17:03.122
Tower to Antonov.
What are you doing?

01:17:03.289 --> 01:17:05.040
Shut down immediately.

01:17:12.382 --> 01:17:13.716
Caesar.

01:17:13.883 --> 01:17:17.136
Okay, when I say go,
you push all this down at once, okay?

01:17:17.303 --> 01:17:18.387
- Okay.
- Go!

01:17:19.222 --> 01:17:21.890
Antonov, abort takeoff.
You do not have clearance.

01:17:22.058 --> 01:17:24.893
You must abort.
I repeat, you must abort.

01:17:25.061 --> 01:17:26.103
No!

01:17:31.901 --> 01:17:35.070
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know, but it's not good.

01:17:37.991 --> 01:17:39.283
- Push.
- Pushing.

01:17:39.451 --> 01:17:40.993
Come on!

01:17:44.581 --> 01:17:46.832
We're going down!
We're going down!

01:17:53.381 --> 01:17:55.758
Where are the flaps?
The flaps are not down.

01:17:55.925 --> 01:17:57.885
It must be the pumps. Take over.

01:17:58.053 --> 01:18:00.637
Take over?
What do you mean, take over?

01:18:02.766 --> 01:18:04.099
- Sasha!
- Relax!

01:18:04.267 --> 01:18:05.309
Sit down!

01:18:09.689 --> 01:18:12.149
God. God. Jesus.

01:18:15.028 --> 01:18:16.612
- Oh, God.
- Okay, I think I got it.

01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:19.531
- Sasha, now!
- Okay, okay. Take a deep breath.

01:18:20.450 --> 01:18:21.950
Pull!

01:18:23.536 --> 01:18:26.622
Come on, baby.
Lift your big ass for Sasha!

01:18:31.461 --> 01:18:33.128
- Pull! Pull!
- Come on.

01:18:45.433 --> 01:18:46.475
Mommy.

01:18:48.645 --> 01:18:50.479
Was that the Eiffel Tower?

01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:52.648
I think so.

01:19:00.448 --> 01:19:01.907
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:19:02.492 --> 01:19:05.077
...we are on our way to China.

01:19:06.705 --> 01:19:10.040
Good. That is good, huh?

01:19:20.427 --> 01:19:24.346
Do not believe in something simply
because you have heard it, Nima.

01:19:25.432 --> 01:19:28.225
But, great Lama,
Tenzin is my brother.

01:19:29.269 --> 01:19:32.229
He works inside the big tunnel,
where the ships are built.

01:19:35.316 --> 01:19:39.778
But what is there in your wisdom,
great Lama, if Tenzin is right?

01:19:40.405 --> 01:19:42.823
What if our world
is indeed coming to an end?

01:19:52.959 --> 01:19:56.211
it is full, great Rinpoche.

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:03.052
Like this cup...

01:20:03.219 --> 01:20:07.723
...you are full of opinions
and speculations.

01:20:09.726 --> 01:20:11.393
To see the light of wisdom...

01:20:11.770 --> 01:20:14.605
...you first must empty your cup.

01:20:32.248 --> 01:20:33.749
Be careful with the clutch.

01:20:34.584 --> 01:20:36.585
it tends to slip.

01:20:54.896 --> 01:20:57.940
- Grandma.
- Grandpa, Nima is here!

01:20:58.525 --> 01:21:00.275
Grandma,
I got a message from Tenzin.

01:21:00.652 --> 01:21:03.445
He wants us to meet him
in Cho Ming at the west gate.

01:21:04.197 --> 01:21:07.116
He says he can get us on the ships
he's working on.

01:21:08.118 --> 01:21:11.370
What are you talking about?
Tenzin works on the dam.

01:21:14.708 --> 01:21:16.291
Grandma...

01:21:16.876 --> 01:21:20.254
...the dam is a ship!
The government lied to us.

01:21:20.588 --> 01:21:22.673
There will be a big flood!

01:21:23.341 --> 01:21:24.800
We must pack up right away.

01:21:25.093 --> 01:21:27.720
Nima, he gave you the truck?

01:21:28.930 --> 01:21:31.640
We took a trip
on the Laem Song ferry once.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:34.852
Grandpa threw up the whole way.

01:21:36.354 --> 01:21:37.646
Let's eat first.

01:21:43.737 --> 01:21:45.112
Hey, look. The new Bentley.

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.281
Our father had one on order.

01:21:47.449 --> 01:21:49.533
We were supposed
to get it next year.

01:21:49.701 --> 01:21:52.202
But then he canceled it
because of the ships.

01:21:53.204 --> 01:21:55.956
How many cars
does your family have?

01:21:56.541 --> 01:21:58.125
My mom's boyfriend
has a Porsche.

01:21:59.669 --> 01:22:01.462
Our parents are divorced too.

01:22:01.629 --> 01:22:04.006
Yeah, but there's nothing
we can do about that.

01:22:04.174 --> 01:22:05.966
Found a hat.

01:22:06.134 --> 01:22:07.384
She has a thing for hats.

01:22:08.178 --> 01:22:10.512
I was just like that at her age.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.348
They made me feel safe.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:16.518
So how did you meet Dr. Silberman?

01:22:17.854 --> 01:22:20.647
As you can see,
not the same way you did.

01:22:21.900 --> 01:22:25.861
My boyfriend asked me
to get them done.

01:22:26.029 --> 01:22:27.279
He's not your husband?

01:22:27.447 --> 01:22:31.909
Oh, no. We are not married.
And probably never will.

01:22:39.668 --> 01:22:41.418
For the boys.

01:22:46.049 --> 01:22:48.175
They seem to like each other, huh?

01:22:48.343 --> 01:22:50.219
She is adorable.

01:22:50.387 --> 01:22:52.429
Yeah, I guess.

01:22:53.723 --> 01:22:56.809
So tell me, Mr. Karpov,
how much did you pay?

01:22:57.394 --> 01:23:01.522
One billion euro. Per seat.

01:23:02.899 --> 01:23:05.651
- That's disgusting.
- Oh, yeah?

01:23:06.528 --> 01:23:10.280
You know, Curtis,
I wasn't always businessman.

01:23:10.448 --> 01:23:12.658
I am a boxer.

01:23:12.826 --> 01:23:16.453
Was my only playing
when I was boy back in Murmansk.

01:23:16.663 --> 01:23:21.041
And my coach,
his name was also Yuri.

01:23:21.209 --> 01:23:22.751
He always said:

01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:29.717
"If someone wants to beat you,
he has to kill you first. "

01:23:32.762 --> 01:23:34.346
That's very nice.

01:23:34.514 --> 01:23:35.639
Yeah.

01:23:35.932 --> 01:23:41.520
But tell me, what would you have done
if you rich like me?

01:23:41.688 --> 01:23:45.566
Look.
They are wonderful children, huh?

01:23:46.901 --> 01:23:48.318
Okay, guys.

01:23:48.486 --> 01:23:51.405
The plan is to refuel in Hawaii,
so sit down and buckle up.

01:23:52.073 --> 01:23:54.283
Gordon and I will do the rwst.

01:23:56.953 --> 01:23:57.995
Oh, God.

01:24:00.290 --> 01:24:01.623
Go get the guys.

01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:07.671
Guys, there's a...
You might wanna...

01:24:26.649 --> 01:24:28.525
What is that?

01:24:28.985 --> 01:24:30.819
The state of Hawaii.

01:24:31.363 --> 01:24:35.240
Not good. That is not good.

01:24:40.330 --> 01:24:42.081
How much fuel do we have left?

01:24:42.248 --> 01:24:45.501
Not enough. We're going to
have to make a water landing...

01:24:45.669 --> 01:24:47.670
...somewherw in South China Sea.

01:24:47.837 --> 01:24:50.422
Great. At least we're not gonna need
the landing gear.

01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:53.717
- What about it?
- Oh, we lost it all. in Vegas.

01:25:05.105 --> 01:25:06.855
Dr. Wilson, may I come in?

01:25:07.482 --> 01:25:11.193
I'm not very good company,
I'm afraid, Dr...?

01:25:11.403 --> 01:25:13.946
Please, call me Adrian.

01:25:19.619 --> 01:25:22.079
All those people we left behind...

01:25:22.706 --> 01:25:25.165
...they don't stand a chance,
do they?

01:25:26.668 --> 01:25:30.379
I believe that nature
will choose for itself from itself...

01:25:30.547 --> 01:25:31.714
...what will survive.

01:25:33.842 --> 01:25:37.219
Just like you
preserving those great artworks.

01:25:37.804 --> 01:25:41.140
Our culture is our soul,
and that's not dying tonight.

01:25:41.307 --> 01:25:42.975
Oh, come on.

01:25:43.476 --> 01:25:45.811
I contributed to this cover-up.

01:25:45.979 --> 01:25:49.064
And Da Vinci, Picasso, they're in.

01:25:49.232 --> 01:25:51.525
But you're some nobody,
you don't stand a chance.

01:25:51.693 --> 01:25:52.901
That's not...

01:25:53.653 --> 01:25:56.030
That's not necessarily true.

01:25:56.573 --> 01:26:00.909
You ever hear of a writer
called Jackson Curtis?

01:26:01.077 --> 01:26:03.287
Wrote a book, Farewell Atlantis.

01:26:03.830 --> 01:26:06.498
What do you think the chances are
of an unknown writer...

01:26:06.666 --> 01:26:10.502
...who barely sold 500 copies,
making it aboard this plane?

01:26:11.504 --> 01:26:12.546
I don't understand.

01:26:12.714 --> 01:26:16.884
I mean, call it chance or fate or nature.
it doesn't matter.

01:26:17.052 --> 01:26:20.596
This book is part of our legacy now.
Why?

01:26:21.014 --> 01:26:22.931
Because I'm reading it.

01:26:26.603 --> 01:26:30.147
Dr. Helmsley, please report
to the Situation Room immediately.

01:26:43.870 --> 01:26:47.081
Hello. I'm sorry. Who is this?

01:26:47.248 --> 01:26:51.043
This is Yoko Delgatto.
Do you wanna speak to my daddy?

01:26:54.547 --> 01:26:56.048
Yes, please.

01:26:56.216 --> 01:26:58.467
Who should I say is calling?

01:27:01.805 --> 01:27:04.598
Tell him it's his father.

01:27:04.766 --> 01:27:06.642
You're my grandpa?

01:27:07.727 --> 01:27:10.062
Yes, sweetheart, I am.

01:27:11.940 --> 01:27:14.858
Daddy, Daddy,
Grandpa's on the phone.

01:28:18.048 --> 01:28:19.131
Mr. President, sir.

01:28:24.012 --> 01:28:25.637
Mr. President.

01:28:27.140 --> 01:28:29.892
- What's the matter, sweetie?
- She can't find her daddy.

01:28:32.604 --> 01:28:34.563
Why don't you two
get comfy on that couch?

01:28:34.731 --> 01:28:37.524
Sally, come help them out, okay?

01:28:38.818 --> 01:28:40.819
I'll find your daddy.

01:28:48.578 --> 01:28:50.245
Who can help me
with missing persons?

01:28:50.413 --> 01:28:52.956
Sorry, man.
I'm really busy right now.

01:28:54.167 --> 01:28:57.086
I mean... Of course, sir.
Sorry, Mr. President.

01:28:57.253 --> 01:29:00.047
Don't worry about it.
You're doing a great job, son.

01:29:26.282 --> 01:29:28.617
- What?
- The capital's been hit by a 9.4.

01:29:28.785 --> 01:29:30.119
We've lost communication.

01:29:30.286 --> 01:29:33.330
- Where's it centered?
- North Chesapeake Bay.

01:29:37.043 --> 01:29:40.713
Mr. Anheuser, the Russian president's
on the line, sir.

01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.922
Excuse me.

01:29:42.841 --> 01:29:45.300
We just entered Chinese airspace.

01:29:46.594 --> 01:29:48.470
That's affirmative, Mr. President.

01:29:48.638 --> 01:29:53.350
Until communication is restored,
I suppose I am in command.

01:29:54.310 --> 01:29:56.895
it appears that all other
heads of state are en route...

01:29:57.063 --> 01:29:59.690
...with the exception
of the Italian prime minister...

01:30:00.108 --> 01:30:04.737
...who has also decided
to stay behind and trust in prayer.

01:31:11.930 --> 01:31:14.264
The Earth's crust has begun to shift,
Dr. Helmsley.

01:31:14.432 --> 01:31:17.643
- By what degree?
-1.2 degrees, but it's still moving.

01:31:17.811 --> 01:31:19.103
So, what happens next?

01:31:19.270 --> 01:31:21.772
Once the movement
of our land masses comes to a halt...

01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:23.732
Let's see a simulation, Scotty.

01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:26.151
...expect the formation
of gigantic tsunamis...

01:31:26.319 --> 01:31:29.613
...proportional to the magnitude
of the corresponding quakes.

01:31:34.828 --> 01:31:36.662
Pull up the Japanese seaboard,
will you?

01:31:36.830 --> 01:31:38.455
Yes, sir.

01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:41.834
My dad's on a cruise ship out here.

01:31:42.794 --> 01:31:45.462
But I guess you already
knew that, huh?

01:31:46.256 --> 01:31:49.925
Sir, we recorded
two underwater quakes at 7.9 and 8.2.

01:32:07.444 --> 01:32:08.986
From what we have just learned...

01:32:09.154 --> 01:32:12.197
...Tokyo seems to have taken
the full force of the earthquake.

01:32:12.365 --> 01:32:14.616
At this point,
unconfirmed reports indicate...

01:32:14.784 --> 01:32:17.703
...that large areas of land
are underwater.

01:32:17.871 --> 01:32:20.039
Please stay tuned for further...

01:32:29.758 --> 01:32:31.425
Tony...

01:32:31.968 --> 01:32:33.552
I called.

01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:38.932
I was too late.

01:32:43.355 --> 01:32:46.648
Maybe they got out in time.

01:32:46.816 --> 01:32:48.817
You never know. They...

01:33:17.097 --> 01:33:18.472
Harry!

01:34:16.072 --> 01:34:18.741
I'm coming home, Dorothy.

01:34:45.143 --> 01:34:46.602
Anything?

01:34:48.021 --> 01:34:51.565
Nothing. Just static.
Not even an emergency signal.

01:35:04.913 --> 01:35:06.997
Can't think about
what's going on down there.

01:35:14.422 --> 01:35:16.423
Remember that old Beetle
we used to camp in?

01:35:16.591 --> 01:35:18.467
We could never get the roof up.

01:35:18.635 --> 01:35:20.219
Yeah.

01:35:20.387 --> 01:35:22.304
We definitely traded up.

01:35:25.266 --> 01:35:27.267
Tried to find our old spot
at Yellowstone...

01:35:27.686 --> 01:35:29.645
...when I went camping
with the kids...

01:35:30.855 --> 01:35:32.564
...but I couldn't find it.

01:35:40.990 --> 01:35:42.825
Do you think people change?

01:35:43.785 --> 01:35:45.494
By "people," do you mean me?

01:35:45.662 --> 01:35:48.914
Yes. Do you think you've changed
since we separated?

01:35:51.042 --> 01:35:53.002
I certainly eat a lot more cereal now.

01:35:57.465 --> 01:35:59.717
You always had tunnel vision.

01:36:00.468 --> 01:36:03.637
You could just block everything out
and write.

01:36:07.225 --> 01:36:09.018
You blocked us out.

01:36:18.486 --> 01:36:19.903
Do you love him?

01:36:22.699 --> 01:36:24.575
I love him enough.

01:36:37.047 --> 01:36:40.299
All global ground communication
has ceased, sir.

01:36:44.012 --> 01:36:46.347
The only signals our satellites
are picking up...

01:36:46.514 --> 01:36:48.891
...are coming from the vessels
in Cho Ming.

01:36:49.601 --> 01:36:51.643
Well, there's a piece of good news.

01:36:51.811 --> 01:36:53.062
Any updates, doctor?

01:36:53.229 --> 01:36:56.398
We expect the tsunamis
to reach landfall in every continent.

01:36:56.566 --> 01:37:00.069
The Cho Ming area will be impacted
in approximately six hours.

01:37:01.821 --> 01:37:04.865
it looks like the crust has shifted
by almost 23 degrees...

01:37:05.033 --> 01:37:06.825
...to the southwest.

01:37:07.035 --> 01:37:11.914
The data also shows the Earth's poles
have reversed their magnetic fields.

01:37:12.082 --> 01:37:13.499
These are their new positions.

01:37:14.417 --> 01:37:15.918
So you're...

01:37:16.711 --> 01:37:19.129
You're telling me
that the North Pole...

01:37:19.673 --> 01:37:21.924
...is now somewhere in Wisconsin?

01:37:22.092 --> 01:37:24.426
Actually, that's the South Pole now.

01:37:33.186 --> 01:37:35.479
Engine failure.
Two of the six are down.

01:37:35.647 --> 01:37:37.564
We must get ready.

01:37:38.650 --> 01:37:42.528
- How long do we have?
- Fifteen minutes. Maybe.

01:37:44.030 --> 01:37:46.990
- Better wake up the kids.
- Yeah.

01:38:26.531 --> 01:38:28.657
Why do you hate Gordon?

01:38:32.579 --> 01:38:34.288
Hey.

01:38:34.664 --> 01:38:36.248
Come on.

01:38:37.584 --> 01:38:39.668
What are you talking about?

01:38:39.836 --> 01:38:41.170
I don't hate him.

01:38:41.338 --> 01:38:42.921
Well, you don't like him, either.

01:38:43.506 --> 01:38:46.258
Well, that's just because
I don't know him that well, maybe.

01:38:46.426 --> 01:38:47.718
Yeah, but I do.

01:38:47.886 --> 01:38:50.179
He's really nice
once you get to know him.

01:38:50.347 --> 01:38:51.972
You should talk to him more often.

01:38:52.140 --> 01:38:55.017
You guys would get along
really, really well.

01:38:58.438 --> 01:39:00.230
You like him a lot, huh?

01:39:08.865 --> 01:39:10.574
I'll do my best, I promise.

01:39:11.034 --> 01:39:12.409
Okay?

01:39:13.578 --> 01:39:17.456
I'm really proud of you.
Really, really proud of you.

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:20.376
is it time?

01:39:22.295 --> 01:39:23.587
Yeah.

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:29.635
- Dad, what's wrong?
- Well, Sasha said we gotta land...

01:39:29.803 --> 01:39:33.514
...and it's gonna be a little bumpy
and maybe a little wet.

01:39:33.682 --> 01:39:34.723
Daddy?

01:39:41.106 --> 01:39:42.314
Hold her steady.

01:40:00.417 --> 01:40:02.710
Daddy,
I'm not a really good swimmer.

01:40:02.877 --> 01:40:06.964
Hey, no, that's all right.
That's what you got this for. Right?

01:40:07.132 --> 01:40:10.217
it's like being in a swimming pool,
only it's got more cool stuff.

01:40:10.385 --> 01:40:13.637
Look, it's got a whistle,
and a light thing. Right?

01:40:13.805 --> 01:40:15.931
I thought we were going to China.

01:40:16.933 --> 01:40:19.018
No, we gotta land here.

01:40:22.022 --> 01:40:24.273
So we're just all gonna
stay together, right?

01:40:24.441 --> 01:40:27.401
- No, we're not, we're gonna die.
- No. We're not.

01:40:28.111 --> 01:40:29.570
Promise?

01:40:29.738 --> 01:40:31.822
I promise you
we're gonna all stay together...

01:40:31.990 --> 01:40:35.617
...no matter what happens, okay?

01:40:48.798 --> 01:40:50.257
Jackson.

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.134
Yuri.

01:40:53.303 --> 01:40:55.095
I think you better come up here.

01:40:55.805 --> 01:40:57.264
I'm gonna go check this out.

01:40:57.432 --> 01:40:59.433
- Dad. Where are you going?
- I'll be back.

01:40:59.601 --> 01:41:02.519
- You said you'd stay with us.
- We gotta buckle up. Let's go.

01:41:03.813 --> 01:41:06.023
Okay, don't ask me
how that happened...

01:41:06.191 --> 01:41:07.649
...but there is no more ocean...

01:41:07.817 --> 01:41:09.860
...and we're close
to where we wanted to go.

01:41:10.028 --> 01:41:12.237
it's like the world shifted
by 1000 miles.

01:41:12.405 --> 01:41:14.990
One thousand five hundrwd
and seventy-eight to be exact.

01:41:15.158 --> 01:41:17.534
it's called
Earth Crust Displacement Theory.

01:41:17.744 --> 01:41:19.828
Professor Hapgood, 1958.

01:41:20.705 --> 01:41:21.747
Way to go, Charlie.

01:41:25.835 --> 01:41:27.169
What was that?

01:41:28.171 --> 01:41:30.381
We just lost our last two engines.

01:41:49.150 --> 01:41:52.277
I'm gonna shoot for that glacier.
it's gonna get rocky.

01:41:52.445 --> 01:41:56.699
Listen, this is gonna sound crazy,
but here's what you have to do.

01:42:00.328 --> 01:42:02.496
Unbuckle.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:05.916
Yuri! What are we doing?

01:42:06.084 --> 01:42:08.585
We are taking the Bentley.

01:42:10.171 --> 01:42:12.715
Not yet. Not yet.

01:42:12.882 --> 01:42:14.425
it has to be perfect.

01:42:14.592 --> 01:42:16.176
Almost there.

01:42:16.344 --> 01:42:18.887
- Come on.
- Get in the car.

01:42:28.898 --> 01:42:31.650
Okay, go. Now. Pull.

01:42:36.573 --> 01:42:39.074
No, no, no!

01:42:42.078 --> 01:42:43.495
Go. Go, Jackson.

01:42:43.663 --> 01:42:46.165
No, we gotta wait
for Sasha and Gordon.

01:42:46.332 --> 01:42:49.960
Go. Make sure everybody gets out
of the plane before I touch down.

01:42:50.128 --> 01:42:51.170
What about you?

01:42:51.338 --> 01:42:55.841
I'll be fine.
I have to touch this baby down.

01:42:56.551 --> 01:42:58.260
What are you waiting for?

01:42:58.428 --> 01:43:01.180
Go! Go!

01:43:15.612 --> 01:43:16.987
There he is. I see him.

01:43:17.155 --> 01:43:19.740
- Wherw is Sasha? Wherw is Sasha?
- Come on. Let's go.

01:43:19.908 --> 01:43:23.035
He said he's fine. We should get
out of here before he touches down.

01:43:23.203 --> 01:43:25.371
No, no, no. Don't go.
We have to wait for him.

01:43:25.914 --> 01:43:27.831
Go, Jackson. Go.

01:43:27.999 --> 01:43:31.669
- Don't go!
- it won't start. it won't start.

01:43:31.836 --> 01:43:35.339
Just shut up, everybody!

01:43:36.299 --> 01:43:37.758
Engine...

01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:39.551
...start.

01:43:42.972 --> 01:43:45.391
Voice control. Sold me on it.

01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:27.868
Hey! Hey!

01:45:48.765 --> 01:45:50.974
Welcome to
the People's Republic of China.

01:45:51.559 --> 01:45:53.727
Good to be here. Say hi, kids.

01:45:53.895 --> 01:45:54.978
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:45:55.146 --> 01:45:56.772
What color are your passes?

01:45:58.441 --> 01:46:00.984
What color
are your boarding passes?

01:46:02.696 --> 01:46:03.862
I have green card.

01:46:05.073 --> 01:46:06.949
For my boys and me.

01:46:07.117 --> 01:46:08.617
What?

01:46:12.038 --> 01:46:14.206
Yuri. Yuri.

01:46:14.374 --> 01:46:17.751
Yuri, it's a mistake. A joke, right?

01:46:17.919 --> 01:46:19.420
What?

01:46:19.754 --> 01:46:23.132
You think I didn't know
about you and Sasha?

01:46:24.884 --> 01:46:27.928
May God bless
that poor bastard's soul.

01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:36.395
I'm sorry, guys. Good luck.

01:46:37.814 --> 01:46:39.565
Come on, boys.

01:46:41.192 --> 01:46:43.235
- Does anybody have any money?
- I do, I do.

01:46:43.403 --> 01:46:44.862
You got a billion euros?

01:46:49.868 --> 01:46:50.909
Dr. Wilson?

01:46:51.828 --> 01:46:54.413
I'm Captain Michaels,
skipper of the American ship.

01:46:54.581 --> 01:46:56.832
Please accept my condolences
for your father.

01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:58.751
Thank you, captain.

01:47:00.128 --> 01:47:02.880
Mr. Anheuser,
your party is the last to arrive.

01:47:07.135 --> 01:47:09.470
There've been reports
of severe damage, captain.

01:47:09.637 --> 01:47:11.513
What's the status of Ark Number 3?

01:47:11.681 --> 01:47:14.016
We haven't done
a complete assessment yet...

01:47:14.184 --> 01:47:16.477
...but it looks like we lost it.

01:47:26.071 --> 01:47:28.697
No toothbrush. Only books.

01:47:29.616 --> 01:47:33.035
Yeah, when I was a kid,
my dad was on the road a lot.

01:47:33.661 --> 01:47:35.913
He would always leave me
a box full of books...

01:47:36.081 --> 01:47:38.040
...call me every night and quiz me.

01:47:38.625 --> 01:47:41.585
I'd get an ice-cream cone
for every book I read...

01:47:41.753 --> 01:47:42.920
...so I was a fat kid.

01:47:44.547 --> 01:47:46.215
I find that very hard to believe.

01:47:46.383 --> 01:47:47.633
No, it's true.

01:47:47.801 --> 01:47:51.303
My high school career
was 2000 books...

01:47:51.471 --> 01:47:53.180
...and zero girlfriends.

01:47:54.641 --> 01:47:57.559
I didn't even kiss a boy
till I was in college.

01:47:57.936 --> 01:48:00.396
They were all too scared
of my dad.

01:48:47.944 --> 01:48:49.778
Leave it to the Chinese.

01:48:49.946 --> 01:48:51.780
I didn't think it was possible.

01:48:51.948 --> 01:48:53.615
Not in the time we had.

01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:55.659
That's Ark Number 3, sir.

01:48:56.578 --> 01:48:59.872
The roof collapsed on it
during the shifting of the Earth's crust.

01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:02.291
Jesus Christ.

01:49:03.501 --> 01:49:06.962
Boarding of Ark Number 3 will be
delayed due to technical difficulties.

01:49:07.130 --> 01:49:08.630
- Excuse me.
- We paid a fortune!

01:49:08.798 --> 01:49:11.800
Please be patient
as we keep you updated.

01:49:11.968 --> 01:49:13.802
Hey, what's going on here?

01:49:13.970 --> 01:49:16.513
I have a green card
for my boys and me.

01:49:16.723 --> 01:49:18.766
I want to speak to a supervisor.

01:49:18.933 --> 01:49:20.059
I am the supervisor.

01:49:20.226 --> 01:49:23.771
Get back with the other green cards
or I'll have you detained.

01:49:25.732 --> 01:49:27.900
What he said about you and Sasha,
is it true?

01:49:28.068 --> 01:49:31.820
Sasha was worth
100 times a man like Yuri.

01:49:31.988 --> 01:49:34.406
I should have listened to you,
Dr. Silberman.

01:49:34.574 --> 01:49:39.536
I actually liked the way I looked
before that monster talked me into it.

01:49:39.704 --> 01:49:41.997
Did you know he asked me
for a discount?

01:49:42.165 --> 01:49:44.124
And he paid in installments.

01:49:44.292 --> 01:49:45.876
Cheap bastard.

01:49:46.044 --> 01:49:47.628
You hear that?

01:49:50.382 --> 01:49:52.257
Over therw!

01:49:53.802 --> 01:49:55.344
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:49:55.512 --> 01:49:57.721
- Stop! Stop! Please!
- Hey! Hold it!

01:50:01.726 --> 01:50:03.477
Hey! Hey!

01:50:03.978 --> 01:50:06.730
Stop! Stop! Stop!

01:50:08.024 --> 01:50:09.650
Help!

01:50:18.993 --> 01:50:20.119
Hey!

01:50:39.472 --> 01:50:41.056
How were all these people chosen?

01:50:41.224 --> 01:50:43.892
Same way your art was:
By experts from all over the world.

01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:47.062
We had geneticists determine
the perfect gene pool to repopulate.

01:50:47.230 --> 01:50:49.064
These people
were chosen by geneticists?

01:50:49.232 --> 01:50:52.609
All green-card holders,
please proceed to Gallery D-4.

01:50:52.777 --> 01:50:54.945
Looks like their checkbooks
got them onboard.

01:50:55.113 --> 01:50:58.073
Right. Without billions of dollars
from the private sector...

01:50:58.241 --> 01:50:59.908
...this would've been impossible.

01:51:00.076 --> 01:51:02.161
We sold tickets.

01:51:02.328 --> 01:51:05.789
And what about all these workers?
They all get passes?

01:51:06.416 --> 01:51:10.377
What, life isn't fair? is that it?

01:51:10.545 --> 01:51:13.464
You wanna donate your passes
to a couple of Chinese workers...

01:51:13.631 --> 01:51:15.549
...you be my guest.

01:51:16.009 --> 01:51:19.553
Captain, I want a prelaunch briefing.
All international teams present.

01:51:54.714 --> 01:51:56.548
What the hell?

01:51:59.719 --> 01:52:03.389
What is this?
You could fit 10 people in here.

01:52:10.146 --> 01:52:11.480
Satnam, where are you?

01:52:11.648 --> 01:52:14.441
- On the Nampan Plateau.
- What?

01:52:15.652 --> 01:52:17.986
There's a tidal wave
coming from the east.

01:52:18.154 --> 01:52:21.323
- it's gigantic.
- Satnam, what happened?

01:52:21.491 --> 01:52:23.617
We never got picked up, Adrian.

01:52:23.785 --> 01:52:25.994
The airlift never came.

01:52:27.497 --> 01:52:29.248
Goodbye, my friend.

01:52:29.874 --> 01:52:35.796
Satnam.

01:52:57.694 --> 01:53:00.612
- The flooding is coming this way?
- Mary. Where are we set up?

01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:02.239
Over therw.

01:53:05.869 --> 01:53:07.995
Get me the satellite images
from Nampan, India.

01:53:08.163 --> 01:53:09.872
- Okay, right away.
- What's happening?

01:53:11.166 --> 01:53:13.792
No. Satnam was talking
about another wave...

01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:15.461
...coming from the east.

01:53:19.049 --> 01:53:21.508
- Holy mother.
- The flooding is gonna hit earlier?

01:53:21.676 --> 01:53:24.386
is that what you're telling me?
The second wave is closer?

01:53:24.554 --> 01:53:26.513
- Plug in the new data.
- Okay.

01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:29.933
- Satnam didn't get picked up.
- What?

01:53:30.352 --> 01:53:33.187
A lot of people didn't get picked up
in this chaos.

01:53:33.355 --> 01:53:34.980
This is not a conspiracy, Helmsley.

01:53:35.398 --> 01:53:38.442
Your predictions haven't exactly
panned out, have they, doctor?

01:53:38.610 --> 01:53:40.527
it's ready. it's ready.

01:53:42.447 --> 01:53:44.448
Oh, God. it's 1500 meters high.

01:53:45.992 --> 01:53:49.161
When's it gonna get here? Talk to me,
Helmsley. When's it gonna hit?

01:53:49.329 --> 01:53:50.996
Adjust the countdown.

01:54:07.138 --> 01:54:10.015
Twenty-eight minutes,
10 seconds to impact.

01:54:10.183 --> 01:54:11.433
Oh, my God.

01:54:11.601 --> 01:54:15.062
Captain, I need to speak to the other
heads of state immediately.

01:54:15.230 --> 01:54:18.023
- Right away. Taylor?
- Aye, captain. Standing by.

01:54:18.191 --> 01:54:20.776
Ark 6, stand by. Ark 7, stand by.

01:54:20.944 --> 01:54:23.612
- Carl Anheuser, acting CIC, Ark 4.
- Yes, sir.

01:54:23.780 --> 01:54:26.073
Requesting emergency conference,
T-99.

01:54:47.095 --> 01:54:49.555
He thinks the world of you,
you know that?

01:54:51.474 --> 01:54:53.225
He's a great little man.

01:54:54.102 --> 01:54:55.644
Yeah.

01:55:03.653 --> 01:55:06.280
I always wanted to have a family
of my own.

01:55:09.868 --> 01:55:12.119
You're a lucky man, Jackson.

01:55:12.787 --> 01:55:14.663
Don't ever forget it.

01:55:30.680 --> 01:55:31.764
Who are they?

01:55:31.931 --> 01:55:33.640
We found them along side
of the road.

01:55:34.309 --> 01:55:35.351
Send them back!

01:55:41.858 --> 01:55:43.400
I am a follower...

01:55:44.319 --> 01:55:46.028
...of our great Lama Rinpoche.

01:55:46.821 --> 01:55:48.238
You know I cannot do that.

01:55:48.406 --> 01:55:49.948
What's the problem?

01:55:50.116 --> 01:55:51.784
You don't have to take all of us.

01:55:51.951 --> 01:55:53.911
Just take my children.
I'm begging you.

01:55:54.412 --> 01:55:56.080
Why should I do that?

01:55:56.247 --> 01:55:59.458
The same reason
you sent for your family.

01:55:59.626 --> 01:56:00.668
Please.

01:56:00.835 --> 01:56:03.253
Just the children.
You don't have to take us.

01:56:03.421 --> 01:56:04.546
Please!

01:56:07.384 --> 01:56:09.551
Please. Oh, my God.

01:56:13.056 --> 01:56:17.059
Please. I don't know
if you can understand what I'm saying.

01:56:17.227 --> 01:56:19.311
As a mother, I'm begging you.

01:56:19.479 --> 01:56:21.230
Please take them.

01:56:22.107 --> 01:56:23.482
Please.

01:56:25.860 --> 01:56:29.655
We are all children of the earth.

01:56:29.823 --> 01:56:33.325
My plan will not work for so many,
Grandma.

01:56:33.493 --> 01:56:37.413
We will take them all.

01:56:40.125 --> 01:56:41.667
Please.

01:56:43.586 --> 01:56:46.296
Thank you. Thank you.

01:56:53.263 --> 01:56:56.098
Attention: All construction workers,
off deck.

01:56:56.516 --> 01:56:59.393
All crew members, onboard now.

01:56:59.561 --> 01:57:01.311
They're opening the mountain.

01:57:01.771 --> 01:57:04.523
They are leaving without us.

01:57:04.691 --> 01:57:07.985
Step back. Get back.
What did I tell you?

01:57:08.153 --> 01:57:11.071
They are leaving you behind too.
Look, idiot.

01:57:11.239 --> 01:57:13.323
Please be patient.

01:57:15.952 --> 01:57:17.453
Let's go.

01:57:20.498 --> 01:57:27.171
Follow me.

01:57:33.803 --> 01:57:34.928
We have to hurry!

01:57:35.555 --> 01:57:36.764
They are leaving!

01:57:39.434 --> 01:57:41.435
initiate security procedures.

01:57:41.603 --> 01:57:46.231
Time to impact:
17 minutes, 42 seconds.

01:57:47.233 --> 01:57:49.777
Oh, excuse me.
Where can I find Adrian Helmsley?

01:57:49.944 --> 01:57:51.362
He's on the bridge. This way.

01:57:55.825 --> 01:57:56.825
Tenzin wait!

01:57:58.411 --> 01:58:00.412
Grandma, we're almost there.

01:58:00.580 --> 01:58:02.498
Green lights on pressure,
Mr. Anton?

01:58:02.665 --> 01:58:04.708
Green lights across the board,
captain.

01:58:16.471 --> 01:58:17.846
Why do they have anchors?

01:58:18.014 --> 01:58:21.308
Because they're not spaceships,
buddy. They're arks.

01:58:21.476 --> 01:58:23.060
Let's go.

01:58:35.365 --> 01:58:36.407
Mr. President.

01:58:37.367 --> 01:58:38.450
You've got to see this.

01:59:08.064 --> 01:59:09.106
Stop.

01:59:09.274 --> 01:59:10.899
Stop! Stop!

01:59:12.318 --> 01:59:13.360
Stop!

01:59:19.951 --> 01:59:21.452
Engage the support mechanisms.

01:59:21.619 --> 01:59:23.829
Aye, aye, captain.
Engaging bow-anchor supports.

01:59:23.997 --> 01:59:26.790
How long are these things expecting
to hold us in place?

01:59:26.958 --> 01:59:29.918
They're just meant to withstand
the first impact of the waves.

01:59:49.647 --> 01:59:51.982
Down there Oleg, you go first!

01:59:56.488 --> 02:00:15.714
Caesar.

02:00:18.551 --> 02:00:20.010
Good. Good boy.

02:00:20.470 --> 02:00:22.638
Come to Mommy. Caesar!

02:00:23.932 --> 02:00:25.808
Mom, where's Tamara?

02:00:28.103 --> 02:00:29.353
Daddy look!

02:00:30.772 --> 02:00:32.856
Come on. Caesar, come on.

02:00:33.024 --> 02:00:34.733
- Tamara!
- I'm coming.

02:00:42.701 --> 02:00:44.326
Take him.

02:01:11.062 --> 02:01:12.896
Oh, my God.
What's happening out there?

02:01:13.064 --> 02:01:14.565
Anheuser.

02:01:15.108 --> 02:01:18.694
Anheuser convinced
the other heads of state to launch.

02:01:21.865 --> 02:01:23.490
Mr. Anheuser.

02:01:25.201 --> 02:01:27.661
We have to stop this madness.

02:01:28.204 --> 02:01:30.539
Make sure the other bridges
can see me.

02:01:30.874 --> 02:01:34.376
- What do you think you're doing?
- I know what I'm doing. Turn it on.

02:01:35.462 --> 02:01:37.755
Ladies and gentlemen,
this Dr. Adrian Helmsley...

02:01:37.922 --> 02:01:40.549
...chief science advisor
to the late President Wilson.

02:01:40.717 --> 02:01:43.761
Could you please turn up the volume,
Mr. Hoffmann?

02:01:44.012 --> 02:01:46.388
We've all been forced
to make difficult decisions...

02:01:46.556 --> 02:01:48.307
...to save our human civilization.

02:01:48.475 --> 02:01:51.018
But to be human
means to care for each other...

02:01:51.186 --> 02:01:55.105
...and civilization means
to work together to create a better life.

02:01:55.273 --> 02:01:57.733
If that's true,
then there's nothing human...

02:01:57.901 --> 02:02:01.195
...and nothing civilized
about what we're doing here.

02:02:01.363 --> 02:02:03.697
Dr. Helmsley's passion is admirable.

02:02:03.865 --> 02:02:07.826
But I will remind you that we have very
limited resources and limited time.

02:02:07.994 --> 02:02:12.498
Ask yourselves, can we really stand by
and watch these people die?

02:02:13.625 --> 02:02:15.250
I read a quote two days ago.

02:02:15.418 --> 02:02:18.003
The author is probably dead by now,
but he said:

02:02:18.171 --> 02:02:20.381
"The moment we stop fighting
for each other...

02:02:20.548 --> 02:02:23.676
...that's the moment
that we lose our humanity. "

02:02:23.843 --> 02:02:25.177
To save the human race...

02:02:25.345 --> 02:02:27.680
...we have an obligation
to stick to this plan...

02:02:27.847 --> 02:02:30.516
...which every nation on this flotilla
has signed up for.

02:02:30.684 --> 02:02:33.727
- We have to let these people in!
- They're in God's hands now.

02:02:35.397 --> 02:02:37.064
Officer, you turn that off.

02:02:38.942 --> 02:02:40.442
That is an order. Turn it off!

02:02:40.610 --> 02:02:42.111
Don't you dare touch that button.

02:02:42.278 --> 02:02:45.114
Have you completely
lost your mind?

02:02:45.281 --> 02:02:48.617
Look at the clock.
We have barely 15 minutes left.

02:02:48.785 --> 02:02:51.787
Do you wanna be responsible
for the extinction of the human race?

02:02:51.955 --> 02:02:53.414
Can you handle that, Adrian?

02:02:53.581 --> 02:02:55.749
There's a young astrophysicist
from India...

02:02:55.917 --> 02:02:58.585
- ... who's the reason we're all here.
- Oh, for God's sake.

02:02:59.254 --> 02:03:02.631
He's the one who discovered it all.
He connected all the dots.

02:03:02.799 --> 02:03:05.300
We all owe him our lives.

02:03:05.468 --> 02:03:07.928
I just learned
that he was killed with his family...

02:03:08.096 --> 02:03:10.889
...in a tsunami in eastern India.

02:03:12.809 --> 02:03:14.184
He was my friend.

02:03:15.478 --> 02:03:17.396
And he died in vain.

02:03:18.023 --> 02:03:21.275
Everybody out there
has died in vain...

02:03:21.443 --> 02:03:25.738
...if we start our future
with an act of cruelty.

02:03:26.781 --> 02:03:28.907
What will you tell your children?

02:03:30.326 --> 02:03:32.411
What will they tell theirs?

02:03:34.748 --> 02:03:38.375
If my father were here,
he would open the gates.

02:03:45.675 --> 02:03:47.051
The people of Russia...

02:03:49.262 --> 02:03:50.429
...along with China...

02:03:52.682 --> 02:03:55.684
...and Japan, agree.

02:03:56.728 --> 02:03:58.645
Open the gates.

02:04:00.690 --> 02:04:04.735
The United Kingdom,
Spain, France, Canada, Germany...

02:04:04.903 --> 02:04:09.365
...and I believe I may also speak
for the Italian prime minister...

02:04:09.532 --> 02:04:12.284
...we vote to let these people
come in.

02:04:18.375 --> 02:04:20.042
Captain Michaels.

02:04:21.586 --> 02:04:22.753
Please.

02:04:26.675 --> 02:04:28.217
This is the captain.

02:04:28.385 --> 02:04:30.969
in a few moments,
we will open the gates...

02:04:31.137 --> 02:04:32.930
...and get you people in.

02:04:33.098 --> 02:04:36.642
Please step back
and clear the platform.

02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:41.438
P- yew, it stinks.

02:05:00.375 --> 02:05:02.751
- They are opening the gates.
- Go. Go.

02:05:02.919 --> 02:05:05.254
Climb! Don't look down! Climb! Go!

02:05:05.422 --> 02:05:07.089
Noah. Noah.

02:05:07.257 --> 02:05:08.424
Get down.

02:05:18.435 --> 02:05:20.227
Mom. Mom, something happened.

02:05:20.395 --> 02:05:21.603
Hold on! Hold on!

02:05:24.441 --> 02:05:25.482
Hold on!

02:05:27.902 --> 02:05:30.195
Gordon, hold on, goddamn it!
Give me your hand!

02:05:30.363 --> 02:05:31.905
- Give me your hand. Reach!
- Help!

02:05:32.073 --> 02:05:34.199
- Reach for it! Gordon!
- Please. Please. Please.

02:05:34.868 --> 02:05:36.368
Gordon! Gordon!

02:05:37.495 --> 02:05:38.662
Gordon!

02:05:39.706 --> 02:05:40.956
No!

02:05:41.916 --> 02:05:43.417
God.

02:05:55.430 --> 02:05:56.472
Pull me up.

02:05:57.432 --> 02:05:58.849
Come on!

02:06:23.541 --> 02:06:24.875
What's wrong with the gate?

02:06:25.043 --> 02:06:28.045
Looks like it didn't run the full cycle.
We're checking, captain.

02:06:28.755 --> 02:06:29.838
Hold it.

02:06:30.840 --> 02:06:31.882
Hold it, people.

02:06:36.471 --> 02:06:39.014
Four minutes to impact.

02:07:22.934 --> 02:07:24.476
Go to the lower deck. Let's go.

02:07:24.644 --> 02:07:27.479
- We are loaded, captain.
- Well, then let's lock it up. Now.

02:07:37.699 --> 02:07:40.743
Oleg. Grab my hand.

02:07:41.161 --> 02:07:42.202
Oleg.

02:07:43.163 --> 02:07:44.455
No, no.

02:07:53.006 --> 02:07:55.841
Papa! Papa!

02:08:00.347 --> 02:08:01.847
Papa!

02:08:13.151 --> 02:08:16.487
- Something's jamming the hydraulics.
- Then get it out, for Chris sake.

02:08:16.654 --> 02:08:19.656
I can't fire up the engines
till we get a good seal on that gate.

02:08:19.824 --> 02:08:22.201
Captain, we have a breach
in the zoological bay.

02:08:22.369 --> 02:08:24.661
- Can you zoom in?
- Yeah.

02:08:28.500 --> 02:08:29.833
I know those kids.

02:08:30.001 --> 02:08:32.002
What is happening?
What's going on?

02:08:32.170 --> 02:08:34.129
Where did they come from?

02:08:36.091 --> 02:08:37.883
There.
Through the hydraulic chamber.

02:08:38.051 --> 02:08:39.802
Captain,
I think we found the problem.

02:08:39.969 --> 02:08:41.470
- Who are these people?
- No, wait.

02:08:42.472 --> 02:08:44.598
He's injured.
Something must have gone wrong.

02:08:44.766 --> 02:08:47.518
Something must have gone wrong?
Something must have gone...?

02:08:47.686 --> 02:08:50.229
Are you kidding me?
Of course something went wrong!

02:08:50.397 --> 02:08:52.272
You know,
congratulations to both of you.

02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:55.984
Might of gotten us killed, but as long
as your conscience is clean.

02:08:56.152 --> 02:08:59.530
Let's get a team down there. I'll meet
them at the hydraulics chamber.

02:08:59.698 --> 02:09:00.864
- You know your way?
- Yeah.

02:09:01.032 --> 02:09:03.951
- Let's go!
- One minute to impact.

02:09:17.674 --> 02:09:21.260
Captain,
Cho Ming Airfield's been hit.

02:09:21.428 --> 02:09:23.178
Put me on emergency com,
Mr. Taylor.

02:09:23.346 --> 02:09:25.681
Aye. You're on, captain.

02:09:25.849 --> 02:09:27.266
This is the captain speaking.

02:09:28.351 --> 02:09:31.020
We expect to be impacted
by water shortly.

02:09:31.187 --> 02:09:33.313
- We need to go this way.
- All new passengers:

02:09:33.481 --> 02:09:35.941
- Hit the deck, brace yourselves.
- Okay, let's go!

02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:39.111
Excuse me. Excuse us. Excuse us.
Brace yourselves!

02:09:39.279 --> 02:09:40.487
Coming through, excuse me.

02:09:53.960 --> 02:09:56.837
All stations, prepare for impact.

02:10:27.077 --> 02:10:28.535
Come on, boys. Go, go, go!

02:10:28.703 --> 02:10:31.163
This way! Let's go! Go, go!

02:10:42.592 --> 02:10:44.843
Collision pressure
just below 80 pascal, captain.

02:10:45.011 --> 02:10:47.554
0.2 mil surface compression
on bow sensors, captain.

02:10:47.722 --> 02:10:51.058
- All right, track Dr. Helmsley.
- There.

02:10:53.186 --> 02:10:54.228
Come on.

02:10:54.396 --> 02:10:55.854
- I got you!
- Get out of the way!

02:10:56.022 --> 02:10:57.898
- We have to get through here.
- Excuse me.

02:10:59.109 --> 02:11:00.984
Tenzin, almost there.

02:11:02.112 --> 02:11:03.654
Nima, what happened?

02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:08.784
Tamara. Will you take the kids
to the stairs, please?

02:11:09.494 --> 02:11:12.496
- Which way?
- We can't get there.

02:11:12.664 --> 02:11:14.957
Water has penetrated the stern.

02:11:15.125 --> 02:11:18.711
The rear of the ship is starting to seal
itself up one compartment at a time!

02:11:19.546 --> 02:11:21.296
Wherw's Gordon?

02:11:22.132 --> 02:11:23.215
No?

02:11:23.758 --> 02:11:25.134
No.

02:11:25.301 --> 02:11:29.346
We gotta go back. We gotta go back!
We need to go back!

02:11:30.432 --> 02:11:33.308
- No! Lilly!
- Mommy!

02:11:33.768 --> 02:11:36.729
- Lilly!
- Help, Daddy!

02:11:38.273 --> 02:11:40.733
Run, Lilly! Run!

02:11:41.276 --> 02:11:44.445
Lilly, run! Go, go!

02:11:45.447 --> 02:11:46.989
Go over, Lilly.

02:11:49.951 --> 02:11:51.577
Caesar. Lilly, take him.

02:11:54.622 --> 02:11:55.873
Mommy!

02:11:57.834 --> 02:11:59.877
Oh, no.

02:12:03.048 --> 02:12:05.799
Sir, is there another way
to the hydraulics chamber?

02:12:05.967 --> 02:12:08.635
- Where does this ladder go?
- To the zoological bay!

02:12:08.803 --> 02:12:10.637
Okay, okay, let's go.

02:12:16.144 --> 02:12:17.186
Professor...

02:12:18.021 --> 02:12:19.855
...it's Air Force One.

02:12:37.457 --> 02:12:39.958
- The mid-ship anchor is hit.
- We're destabilizing.

02:12:40.126 --> 02:12:41.418
The bow anchor's giving in.

02:13:01.022 --> 02:13:02.898
Captain,
the turbine's not responding.

02:13:03.066 --> 02:13:05.901
So override it. Hit the override button
and start the engines.

02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:09.196
We can't start the engine
until we close that gate.

02:13:26.798 --> 02:13:28.841
Help me! Help!

02:13:34.014 --> 02:13:37.349
Tamara!

02:13:38.435 --> 02:13:41.145
- You okay?
- My mommy's in there. Help her.

02:13:41.312 --> 02:13:43.772
We'll get to your mommy.
They're doing everything they can.

02:13:43.940 --> 02:13:46.400
- Can we talk to them?
- I'm gonna try and connect us.

02:13:46.568 --> 02:13:50.487
- We have to stop the bleeding.
- Mom, how about my belt?

02:13:50.655 --> 02:13:53.032
Mr. Curtis! Jackson!

02:13:53.199 --> 02:13:54.366
Hey!

02:13:54.534 --> 02:13:56.577
Help! Hey!

02:13:56.745 --> 02:13:58.746
it's Adrian Helmsley.
We met at Yellowstone.

02:13:58.913 --> 02:14:01.040
That's great!
Open the goddamn door!

02:14:01.207 --> 02:14:02.499
Your daughter is with me!

02:14:02.667 --> 02:14:05.085
- Lilly!
- Lilly!

02:14:05.253 --> 02:14:08.088
- Where's Noah?
- I'm right here, Lil.

02:14:08.631 --> 02:14:10.174
impact warning.

02:14:10.342 --> 02:14:12.217
Thirty degrees west.

02:14:12.385 --> 02:14:14.136
Forty-five degrees east.

02:14:14.304 --> 02:14:17.806
Target elevation, 29,035 feet.

02:14:17.974 --> 02:14:20.768
Twenty-nine thousand feet?
What the hell is at 29,000 feet?

02:14:20.935 --> 02:14:23.187
We're headed straight
for the north face...

02:14:23.355 --> 02:14:25.522
...of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.

02:14:25.690 --> 02:14:30.277
And if we can't start our engines,
we will not survive the impact.

02:14:40.163 --> 02:14:43.082
Jackson, you're sealed off.
We can't get to you!

02:14:43.249 --> 02:14:45.167
There's something blocking
the hydraulics.

02:14:45.335 --> 02:14:48.587
If you can't get it out,
none of us are gonna make it.

02:14:49.089 --> 02:14:51.507
Dr. Helmsley, look at this.

02:14:51.966 --> 02:14:53.676
it is completely submerged
down there.

02:14:53.843 --> 02:14:55.469
There'd be no way to get any air.

02:14:56.221 --> 02:14:59.848
- There's no other way.
- But it's a suicide mission, sir.

02:15:06.898 --> 02:15:09.525
I know where it is, I'll give it a try.

02:15:15.949 --> 02:15:18.784
- Dad. Wait, I wanna go with you.
- No, Noah.

02:15:18.952 --> 02:15:21.829
- Dad. I wanna help you.
- No, no. You are helping me, buddy.

02:15:21.996 --> 02:15:23.038
Dad, please.

02:15:23.206 --> 02:15:25.290
Remember when Lilly was born...

02:15:25.458 --> 02:15:27.960
...and you wanted to be introduced
as her big brother?

02:15:28.128 --> 02:15:31.213
Well, she's scared now,
and she needs you more than ever.

02:15:31.381 --> 02:15:32.381
And if you're safe...

02:15:32.549 --> 02:15:34.925
...I know that she's safe.
Do you understand?

02:15:41.433 --> 02:15:43.934
You can help me out the next time.

02:15:44.102 --> 02:15:45.352
Come on.

02:15:45.520 --> 02:15:48.272
Kate, we caused this thing,
it was us.

02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:51.025
- Gotta go check it out.
- Okay.

02:16:03.413 --> 02:16:04.830
I love you.

02:16:19.304 --> 02:16:22.264
Please! Can you hear me?

02:16:26.436 --> 02:16:31.690
Help!

02:16:54.214 --> 02:16:57.716
Press down.
Press down with your hand.

02:17:05.350 --> 02:17:06.975
Don't stop. Keep pressing.

02:17:24.576 --> 02:17:25.619
Noah!

02:17:30.250 --> 02:17:34.210
Distance to impact: 1850 meters.

02:17:37.298 --> 02:17:38.465
There he is!

02:17:39.843 --> 02:17:41.510
Captain, we have a visual!

02:17:41.678 --> 02:17:44.847
- I think we found the problem.
- Show us the hydraulic chamber!

02:18:02.198 --> 02:18:04.575
Goddamn it,
I told you to stay up there with Mom.

02:18:04.743 --> 02:18:06.160
I just wanted to help.

02:18:06.326 --> 02:18:07.995
All right, all right.

02:18:08.163 --> 02:18:09.288
You hold the light...

02:18:09.456 --> 02:18:11.957
...but from right here,
right in the air pocket, okay?

02:18:12.459 --> 02:18:14.376
You're a crazy little dude.

02:18:19.049 --> 02:18:20.466
Grandma, Grandpa.

02:18:20.967 --> 02:18:22.593
I'm sorry.

02:18:23.011 --> 02:18:26.888
- I could not save us.
- He has gone back in. He will fix it.

02:18:28.224 --> 02:18:30.517
There's no way.

02:18:31.727 --> 02:18:33.728
Don't lose your faith, brother.

02:19:01.341 --> 02:19:03.008
Dad!

02:19:09.557 --> 02:19:13.143
No, we lost him.
We're gonna die. We're gonna die.

02:19:34.374 --> 02:19:36.959
Great job.
You light the way, I'll go for the cable.

02:19:37.127 --> 02:19:38.168
Okay.

02:19:38.335 --> 02:19:41.213
Distance to impact: 400 meters.

02:19:41.380 --> 02:19:44.216
Underwater ridge ahead.
We're going to run aground, captain.

02:20:02.360 --> 02:20:03.402
Yeah!

02:20:14.664 --> 02:20:17.249
- Sir, the gate is sealed.
- That's affirmative, captain.

02:20:17.417 --> 02:20:19.293
Anton, start the engine.

02:20:19.461 --> 02:20:21.211
Aye, aye, captain. Full reverse.

02:20:30.138 --> 02:20:34.350
- Too fast! We're not gonna make it.
- Distance to impact: 50 meters.

02:20:35.018 --> 02:20:36.268
Forty meters.

02:20:59.959 --> 02:21:02.086
Reverse motion activated.

02:21:02.253 --> 02:21:05.714
Distance to impact: 10 meters.

02:21:06.341 --> 02:21:07.508
Twenty meters.

02:21:16.101 --> 02:21:17.434
Yes!

02:21:22.315 --> 02:21:24.608
- Hard to port.
- Aye, captain. Hard to port.

02:21:35.995 --> 02:21:38.038
We did it. We did it. We did it.

02:21:39.082 --> 02:21:41.417
- Where's your dad?
- He was right behind me.

02:21:42.836 --> 02:21:45.713
Any word from the hydraulic chamber?
Where is he?

02:21:45.880 --> 02:21:47.589
I thought you said
he was behind you.

02:21:47.757 --> 02:21:49.299
- He was.
- Are you sure?

02:21:49.467 --> 02:21:51.635
Yeah. He was right there.

02:22:00.228 --> 02:22:03.772
Dad.

02:22:03.940 --> 02:22:05.649
Come on, Jackson. Come on.

02:22:10.113 --> 02:22:13.240
Please, God. Please, please.

02:22:14.784 --> 02:22:17.286
Please, please, please.

02:22:17.996 --> 02:22:19.621
Come on, Jackson.

02:22:24.336 --> 02:22:25.794
Oh, my...

02:22:34.971 --> 02:22:36.472
- He did it!
- Daddy!

02:22:36.639 --> 02:22:40.225
- He did it!
- He did it.

02:23:36.449 --> 02:23:39.618
"Shuttle Atlantis. Our last day.

02:23:39.786 --> 02:23:42.663
All we can hear is the sound
of our own breathing...

02:23:42.831 --> 02:23:48.502
...that reminds us we are still sharing
our memories, hopes and ideas.

02:23:48.712 --> 02:23:52.339
And isn't it funny, just this morning,
we worked it out:

02:23:52.507 --> 02:23:57.094
Somehow or another,
we all have relatives in Wisconsin.

02:23:59.639 --> 02:24:01.056
The end. "

02:24:11.067 --> 02:24:12.401
it's good.

02:24:13.278 --> 02:24:15.237
I thought you'd like it.

02:24:16.656 --> 02:24:17.865
Tell me, Dr. Wilson...

02:24:18.033 --> 02:24:21.326
...apart from books and art...

02:24:22.495 --> 02:24:28.042
...do you think there's anything else
we might possibly share in the future?

02:24:29.127 --> 02:24:33.130
Are you asking me out on a date,
Dr. Helmsley?

02:24:33.798 --> 02:24:36.425
Because, you know,
my diary is pretty full.

02:24:37.802 --> 02:24:39.345
Actually...

02:24:42.265 --> 02:24:44.099
...yes, I was.

02:24:48.271 --> 02:24:50.773
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge, please.

02:24:51.232 --> 02:24:52.608
Dr. Helmsley to the bridge.

02:24:55.487 --> 02:24:57.029
Come herw.

02:25:03.119 --> 02:25:06.163
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Captain Michaels speaking.

02:25:06.331 --> 02:25:09.792
in a few minutes I will give orders
to unseal the decks.

02:25:09.959 --> 02:25:13.087
- Come on.
- At 2345 last night...

02:25:13.254 --> 02:25:17.424
...our sister arks, Numbers 6 and 7,
have joined our course.

02:25:18.927 --> 02:25:20.636
For the first time on ourjourney...

02:25:20.804 --> 02:25:23.806
...we'll have clear skies
and moderate-to-good air quality.

02:25:23.973 --> 02:25:27.267
As you know, our passenger count
is way over capacity.

02:25:27.435 --> 02:25:29.895
So please be careful
when you step out.

02:25:30.063 --> 02:25:33.816
And of course, enjoy the fresh air.

02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:36.985
Can I hold him?

02:25:37.696 --> 02:25:40.322
Sure. He can be your dog too,
if you like.

02:25:40.490 --> 02:25:41.657
Thanks.

02:25:45.745 --> 02:25:49.123
- Where have you been all my life?
- Gift shop.

02:26:45.972 --> 02:26:48.390
Oh, Adrian, excellent.

02:26:48.808 --> 02:26:51.560
I called because we just got
our first satellite feed.

02:26:51.728 --> 02:26:54.229
The equalization
of the oceanic seabeds...

02:26:54.397 --> 02:26:56.899
...has not turned out
to be as extreme as we expected.

02:26:57.067 --> 02:27:00.736
The waters are receding much faster
than we thought, thank God.

02:27:00.904 --> 02:27:02.696
And this is hard to believe...

02:27:02.864 --> 02:27:05.908
...but the Himalayas
are no longer the roof of the world.

02:27:06.076 --> 02:27:09.328
it's now the Drakensberg mountains
of KwaZulu-Natal.

02:27:09.496 --> 02:27:11.580
The entire African continent
has risen.

02:27:11.748 --> 02:27:14.708
Several thousand feet,
and it likely never even flooded.

02:27:14.876 --> 02:27:17.252
That's why they call it
the Cape of Good Hope.

02:27:17.420 --> 02:27:19.213
We've already set course for it.

02:27:26.388 --> 02:27:28.305
Daddy,
when will we go back home?

02:27:29.140 --> 02:27:30.432
Well, we talked about that.

02:27:30.600 --> 02:27:34.269
We're gonna find a new home
out here somewhere, right?

02:27:34.437 --> 02:27:37.189
I mean, wherever we're all together,
that's home.
