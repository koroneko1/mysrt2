What… What are you doing?

8
00:01:31,083 --> 00:01:33,000
No. I'm sorry. I thought it was a bug or…

9
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:34,541
No, no, no. There was nothing there.

10
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:36,875
-What was it?
-I don't know. I have no idea.

-All right. Do you have muffins?

15
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,458
-Uh, no.
-Anything sweet?

16
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:13,875
-No, no, sorry. Um, but I do have oatmeal.
-Um…

17
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:16,375
No. Hmm… Or some hard-boiled eggs?

18
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:19,000
-Or… a kiwi?
-Uh, no.

19
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,125
Really, I'm fine. Don't…
The juice is fine. Thanks.

20
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,083
-I can make you a turkey sandwich.
-That's not necessary. I'm fine. Really.

-Want a cigarette?
-Oh. No, I don't smoke.

24
00:02:59,125 --> 00:03:00,541
-Do you mind if I…?
-No.

25
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:02,791
-Or… Well…
-Yes. It bothers you.

26
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,375
-Maybe if you go on the balcony?
-I didn't think… No, forget it.

27
00:03:14,416 --> 00:03:15,708
Well, uh…

28
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:17,083
[chuckles awkwardly]

29
00:03:18,625 --> 00:03:19,750
So we had sex.

[chuckles softly]

31
00:03:24,625 --> 00:03:26,041
Yeah. We did, huh?

32
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,666
-It wasn't really that bad, right?
-No! Not bad.

33
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,208
-It was okay.
-Yes, that's all normal.

34
00:03:30,291 --> 00:03:33,625
-But you enjoyed it?
-It was… normal.

35
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,791
-Normal?
-Yeah, it was just all right.

36
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,791
Well, you screamed a lot
when you were cumming.

37
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,541
-The last time especially.
-That's 'cause I had strained my calf.

38
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,375
Ah. That's why?

39
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,000
It hurt so much. Oof! My calf…

40
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,791
-Ooh!
-It sounded like screams of pleasure.

41
00:03:47,875 --> 00:03:51,125
No… Well, I mean, a little, yes.

42
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:55,583
But it was mainly the calf. [chuckles]
You likely had a better time than I did.

43
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,958
Me? No way.

44
00:03:57,583 --> 00:04:01,333
Come on.
You said a lot of things when I was…

45
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:02,333
I always say that.

46
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:04,833
You always say…

47
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,500
I mean,
"Bruno, you're fucking me so good."

48
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,666
"Bruno, I've never been fucked like that
before in my life."

49
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,916
You know how it is
when you're in the heat of the moment.

50
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,916
You end up saying all sorts of things.

51
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,250
Kinky things.

52
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:18,750
-But that many?
-It wasn't that many.

53
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:20,000
-You wouldn't stop.
-And you?

54
00:04:20,083 --> 00:04:22,000
I did it to interrupt your monologue.

55
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:23,375
-Wanna take a shower?
-Yes.

56
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,833
Yes, I know. Over there.

-[whispers] He's still here!
-Who's where?

62
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,250
Bruno. The… The nerd from last night.
He's in the shower.

63
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:02,375
Well, at least this one is clean,
because with Lolo, he was always…

64
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:03,583
We hooked up, Vero.

65
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:06,750
And not just once, no.
We started in the bar and kept going.

66
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,875
-What's the problem?
-He drives me nuts!

Albert, you're not gonna believe this.

79
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:46,833
You insulted each other, and regardless,
you spent the night together?

80
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,208
Yeah, no… Look, I don't know.
One thing led to another.

81
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,166
It was brutal. Vero, I just…

82
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:55,000
-What was?
-The sex was.

83
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:58,000
I mean, it was amazing,
and I wasn't in the mood to fuck.

84
00:05:58,083 --> 00:05:59,833
It's not like
I really felt like hooking up.

85
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:03,583
-I mean, I thought he was interesting…
-I mean, I thought he was hot.

86
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:05,833
It's not like
I was sexually attracted to him.

87
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,875
But he really pissed me off.

88
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,291
I just wanted to show him
that he was the same.

89
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,000
That, at any opportunity,
he'd drop his pants.

90
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,958
I wanted to show him
that a guy like him didn't intimidate me.

91
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:19,083
I wanted to shake his
unbearable sense of superiority.

92
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,500
Insult him, you know?

93
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,958
Humiliate him.

94
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,166
And show him that
it wouldn't happen again, you know?

95
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,041
And get out of bed
and leave without saying anything.

96
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,750
Really, Àlex.

97
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,416
I swear I try, but sometimes
I really don't understand you gays.

98
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,583
You have no idea
how the sex was. [giggles]

99
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,041
It was the best sex I've ever had.

100
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,125
We even came at the same time.

101
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,791
And even our synchronization
was perfection.

102
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,000
-Better than Gemma Mengual.
-[Vero chuckles]

103
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:46,166
Who knew that sex with someone you hate
is better than with someone that you love?

-[Bruno chuckles]
-[Álex sighs]

Verónica. I am ready to talk now.

106
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:58,125
I have to go now. [sighs]

107
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,375
Right. How's it going with Patri?

108
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,458
-She called me "Verónica."
-Oof.

109
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:06,833
-I know.
-Tell me later. [blows kiss] I love you.

110
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,333
-I love you, pigeon, see ya. [blows kiss]
-Love you.

[Patri] I made you some tea.

114
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:28,958
Thanks.

115
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:38,875
Uh…

116
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,000
What is all this?

117
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,416
I've been thinking a lot
about what happened last night.

118
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,750
Ah…

[Vero chuckles]

121
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:52,916
-This is a joke, right?
-You think it's a bad idea?

122
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,541
-Well we're not in a crisis.
-[chuckles] One minute.

"It is common for one of the partners

124

to initially deny any existence
of a serious crisis."

125
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:04,250
Patri, we argued over a misunderstanding.
It's not the first time--

126
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:08,625
"And that person will frequently attribute
the fights to irrelevant issues."

-Can you let go of the paper?

128
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,958
My love, I think
it's important to find out

129
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,958
why you acted like that
with the Ibiza thing.

130
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,125
Ahh. Oh.

131
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,583
No, no, no, no. [chuckles]

132
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:18,791
Forget about Ibiza.

133
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,625
I called them last night
and turned it down.

134
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,000
-You did?
-Mm-hmm.

135
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,500
Well, but that doesn't change the fact

136
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,458
that you hid it from me
and treated me like shit.

137
00:08:26,541 --> 00:08:27,958
Patri, but I apologized about that.

138
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh! [chuckles] So that settles it?
That's great.

139
00:08:30,083 --> 00:08:32,125
So there's no problem.
It's as if it never happened.

[Álex] Thank you, sir.

481
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:11,125
You from here?

482
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:14,666
[chuckles] I should say yes,
but then I'd be lying.

00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:17,541
And don't call me sir, please.

484
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:18,875
Um…

485
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:21,500
This… This place is…

486
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:25,083
Mm… A gay bar, isn't it?

487
00:25:25,625 --> 00:25:27,416
That's why you're here, right?

488
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,291
Huh? No, no, no. I had no idea.

489
00:25:29,375 --> 00:25:31,375
Outside it looks like a normal bar.

490
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:34,208
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to say you weren't normal.

491
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,500
I just meant…

492
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:37,708
I meant it's, uh… well…

493
00:25:38,625 --> 00:25:39,833
I just meant that…

494
00:25:40,333 --> 00:25:44,208
-Just that you are a… friend…
-Mm-hmm?

[chuckles] "Dorothy"? No.

497
00:25:48,708 --> 00:25:50,875
-No? Isn't that what you say?
-Not for centuries, no.

499
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:54,958
But, yeah. Yes, I am.

500
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,166
And it's okay if you're not.

501
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,666
Everyone is welcome here.

502
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:03,500
-And do you like working here?
-I hate working here.

503
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:05,750
I didn't want to work
for my father-in-law.

504
00:26:05,833 --> 00:26:08,708
I was supposed to be a painter! [groans]

505
00:26:11,291 --> 00:26:13,875
To exhibit in Berlin and New York.

506
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,791
And be living in an abandoned factory
in Poblenou.

507
00:26:17,875 --> 00:26:20,541
Okay. So you don't have all that,
but you've achieved other things.

508
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:24,166
-Oh yeah? Like what?
-Like… your three children, for example?

509
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,375
You telling me you'd exchange them
for three nights out?

510
00:26:26,458 --> 00:26:28,625
What? No, no. Of course not.

511
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,875
And you have Núria. She loves you…

512
00:26:31,958 --> 00:26:34,541
-Come on. She puts up with your shit.
-[chuckles]

513
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:36,000
She does everything for you.

514
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:38,041
So you can't complain. She does a lot.

515
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,000
-No regrets.
-[Ramiro] I'm glad to hear that.

516
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,500
There's nothing worse
than reaching a certain age

517
00:26:42,583 --> 00:26:45,125
and regretting the decisions
that you've made.

518
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:49,166
Or the ones you didn't.
Those are the worst.

519
00:26:49,666 --> 00:26:52,916
You ever wondered what your life would
look like if you'd made other choices?

520
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,250
It's never too late to change. You know?

521
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,666
[Ramiro] Until it is.

522
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,416
Sometimes I feel like
I've missed all the trains.

523
00:27:00,333 --> 00:27:02,875
When you're young, you assume
there will always be trains to take,

524
00:27:02,958 --> 00:27:03,791
but there aren't.

525
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:06,333
[Albert] Nobody warns you,
but one day they stop coming.

526
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,208
[Ramiro] And, if you haven't
gotten on one,

527
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:11,375
sooner or later
you'll end up alone on the platform.

528
00:27:11,458 --> 00:27:15,583
[Albert] Or worse, in your haste
you end up getting on the wrong train.

529
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:17,291
[Ramiro] Have you ever felt like that?

530
00:27:19,375 --> 00:27:20,291
Oh, hey.

531
00:27:20,791 --> 00:27:22,458
Àlex, honey, hurry.

532
00:27:22,541 --> 00:27:24,916
Be a dear and give me a hand
with the speakers, will you?

533
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,541
I've just had my nails done.

534
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:27,875
Oh.

535
00:27:28,833 --> 00:27:30,666
Who's this incredible sugar daddy?

536
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,833
Are you joining us for tea, honey?

537
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,458
I'll be right there.

538
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:37,875
No, no, no, no. Do what you have to do.
I won't bother you anymore.

539
00:27:38,708 --> 00:27:39,958
Have a nice day.

540
00:27:40,041 --> 00:27:42,916

What are you playing at now?

550

I just didn't feel well.

551
00:28:10,708 --> 00:28:13,416
I don't give a shit.
I just spoke to my daughter.

552
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:16,958
Why the hell is she picking you up
at the police station?

Wait, what?

00:28:18,791 --> 00:28:20,625
[Sunyer] Oh, he didn't tell you?

555
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:23,208
The other day
your friend not only got drunk,

556
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:25,833
he tested positive
for ecstasy and marijuana.

557
00:28:26,416 --> 00:28:28,875
He got into a fight
with some teenagers at the Apolo.

558
00:28:28,958 --> 00:28:33,000
And, on his way to an after-hours club,
he decided to skip a checkpoint

559
00:28:33,083 --> 00:28:36,750
and ended up with his car
smashed into a lamppost on the promenade!

And it's not the first time.

563
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,500
So you should go see her right now
and sort things out.

564
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,000
Or you and I will have a problem.

-Yes.
