1
00:00:16,675 --> 00:00:21,851
"We meet, come to know each other fall in love and part right after.

2
00:00:21,851 --> 00:00:26,052
"This is how many sad stories evolve." Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

3
00:00:55,881 --> 00:00:57,382
This is not a tragedy.

4
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,760
This is a story of love...

5
00:01:00,802 --> 00:01:04,890
that we share, Noeru and me.

6
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:03,782
Did you draw them with pencil?

7
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:12,833
It's not about merit.

8
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:17,796
Did you draw a lot when you were a child?

9
00:02:18,964 --> 00:02:20,841
I guess I did.

10
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:25,011
What is the magazine you said you are working for?

11
00:02:28,557 --> 00:02:30,392
It's called "Splash".

12
00:02:31,727 --> 00:02:37,299
Nowadays the illustrations of the famous are the latest rage.

13
00:02:37,299 --> 00:02:40,860
My drawing are different from yours.

14
00:02:43,488 --> 00:02:46,366
For me, the fun part is to work as a model.

15
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:51,038
I have to say...

16
00:02:53,165 --> 00:02:54,691
yours are...

17
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,960
the best I've seen till now.

18
00:03:05,761 --> 00:03:07,596
Tell me about this drawing The Boy and the Sea.

19
00:03:08,722 --> 00:03:10,565
Do you think to write about it?

20
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:15,312
I don't like to explain my creations.

21
00:03:16,688 --> 00:03:18,815
You are surely right.

22
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:21,809
But that's will not sell magazines.

23
00:03:22,152 --> 00:03:23,762
Surely you are different.

24
00:03:23,762 --> 00:03:25,197
As you will understand, that is not my problem.

25
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:30,452
OK. So will you satisfy my curiosity?

26
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:32,620
Your curiosity?

27
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,166
This painting is...

28
00:03:39,878 --> 00:03:45,175
is the one I like most.

29
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:47,636
It reflects a part of my life.

30
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,412
I see.

31
00:03:55,477 --> 00:03:57,062
This is the one I like best.

32
00:03:58,105 --> 00:03:59,940
You are the first saying this.

33
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:03,110
All the others make stupid questions.

34
00:04:05,028 --> 00:04:09,248
Like: "what is your favourite dish?" "what is your favourite colour?"

35
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:13,537
Your name was...?

36
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,540
I don't remember right now.

37
00:04:17,332 --> 00:04:19,000
You have my business card.

38
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,542
Put Mr. Mamiya. How is your first name read?

39
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:31,471
Taishin.

40
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:34,224
Taishin Mamiya.

41
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,759
Welcome.

42
00:04:53,135 --> 00:04:54,202
For two?

43
00:04:59,916 --> 00:05:01,501
Can this be allowed?

44
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,254
Journalists don't gain so much.

45
00:05:05,322 --> 00:05:09,926
This is my first important job.

46
00:05:12,494 --> 00:05:15,474
Therefore it's different from the others.

47
00:05:16,725 --> 00:05:20,187
I am more of an editor than a journalist.

48
00:05:21,146 --> 00:05:23,774
Let me pay you dinner. Ask whatever you want.

49
00:05:25,249 --> 00:05:26,968
You seem a business man.

50
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:31,406
Relax, it enters as expenses.

51
00:05:32,491 --> 00:05:33,575
Ask what you want.

52
00:05:34,368 --> 00:05:35,118
Really?

53
00:05:38,455 --> 00:05:39,539
Waiter!

54
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:44,678
This, this and this. Without Green pepper.

55
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:47,217
Some of these.

56
00:05:47,518 --> 00:05:49,418
And a bottle of...

57
00:05:49,418 --> 00:05:52,419
- Dom Perignon, please. - Sure, sir.

58
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,788
No, the champagne was a joke, right?

59
00:05:54,788 --> 00:05:56,640
- Waiter! - It's on me.

60
00:05:57,641 --> 00:06:02,062
It's a present. Because I'm your first important job.

61
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,649
How much is a bottle?

62
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:08,568
I don't know. For sure it's expensive.

63
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,615
Give it to me. Thank you.

64
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:17,786
It's already open.

65
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:21,248
Now we have to drink it.

66
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:24,751
But it's on me.

67
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,504
Mr. Mamiya, You are one kind of a man.

68
00:06:29,548 --> 00:06:32,509
I guess you are even more special.

69
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,345
You can not drink.

70
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,180
You are a minor.

71
00:06:38,223 --> 00:06:40,434
Yes, right.

72
00:06:41,476 --> 00:06:43,353
Kids should drink juice.

73
00:06:45,063 --> 00:06:46,523
So, you'll have to drink it alone.

74
00:06:46,523 --> 00:06:47,941
Of course.

75
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,526
It's too expensive to pour it away.

76
00:06:50,694 --> 00:06:51,611
Cheers.

77
00:06:52,988 --> 00:06:53,972
To what will we drink?

78
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:55,991
To your first big job.

79
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,090
Did you rent your studio?

80
00:07:13,091 --> 00:07:14,051
My agency did.

81
00:07:15,594 --> 00:07:17,028
I see.

82
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:19,181
Usually you sleep there?

83
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:20,640
Sometimes.

84
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:22,851
Often I stay in hotels...

85
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,063
or at friends.

86
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,107
I put up with anything.

87
00:07:29,858 --> 00:07:31,718
You have a very liberal life.

88
00:07:32,277 --> 00:07:33,928
Do you miss classes frequently?

89
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,065
What's that now?

90
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,369
Don't preach.

91
00:07:41,203 --> 00:07:42,204
I don't preach!

92
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,414
But you are still a student.

93
00:07:45,207 --> 00:07:47,000
At least finish the school.

94
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:52,381
By the way... about that drawing...

95
00:07:53,382 --> 00:07:54,290
What drawing?

96
00:07:54,549 --> 00:07:56,468
The one of the Boy and the Sea.

97
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,637
It's not for sale.

98
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:00,305
Don't get me wrong.

99
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:04,893
I was wondering if it was Cape Misaki.

100
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:08,897
I am from Misaki, therefore I ask.

101
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,465
Have you been there before?
It's not your business!

102
00:08:14,486 --> 00:08:16,446
Don't ask about that drawing!

103
00:08:18,073 --> 00:08:20,091
OK. I will avoid questions about your private life.

104
00:08:21,034 --> 00:08:24,204
Are you seeing someone?

105
00:08:27,124 --> 00:08:28,204
Well, no.

106
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:33,021
Why not?

107
00:08:33,964 --> 00:08:36,299
You are quite attractive.

108
00:08:39,469 --> 00:08:40,554
Why are you laughing?

109
00:08:41,555 --> 00:08:44,057
This was the last I expected to hear.

110
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:46,059
Really.

111
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:49,938
You must have big success.

112
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:52,357
The truth is, I don't.

113
00:08:53,108 --> 00:08:53,817
I am not like you...

114
00:08:54,985 --> 00:08:56,544
I am not in fashion.

115
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:02,034
I am just an ordinary guy, you are a professional model.

116
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:04,578
I go to the rest-room.

117
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,498
Mr. Mamiya.

118
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,755
No, nothing.

119
00:09:58,498 --> 00:09:59,866
What? You needed to go, too?

120
00:10:02,803 --> 00:10:04,012
What's going on?

121
00:10:28,245 --> 00:10:29,454
What's that?

122
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:08,637
Don't!

123
00:12:11,638 --> 00:12:12,638
Stop!

124
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,565
Please...

125
00:12:15,066 --> 00:12:16,466
Enough!

126
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,942
Don't be afraid.

127
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:11,324
Hey, Mamiya! Mamiya!

128
00:13:14,578 --> 00:13:15,620
What about the interview?

129
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:18,197
What?

130
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:19,457
The article about Noeru Kisaragi.

131
00:13:20,801 --> 00:13:22,544
I am ... working on it.

132
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,129
You are a fool, you know?

133
00:13:25,547 --> 00:13:27,549
But you are still young.

134
00:13:29,176 --> 00:13:31,845
In each interview you give a different image.

135
00:13:33,597 --> 00:13:35,307
But your arrogance drives everybody mad.

136
00:13:37,309 --> 00:13:39,102
It suits you.

137
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:42,022
But you seem to have no ambition.

138
00:13:43,148 --> 00:13:44,691
You are kind of a rowdy.

139
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:30,904
Professor!

140
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:32,155
What?

141
00:14:32,489 --> 00:14:34,074
Can I go to the sick-room?

142
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,951
Are you sick?

143
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,161
I don't feel well.

144
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:39,955
Of course. Go.

145
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:24,082
I knew you would be here.

146
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:35,385
You miss to many classes.

147
00:15:36,845 --> 00:15:37,845
You won't make it for University.

148
00:15:38,597 --> 00:15:39,931
You are skipping them, too.

149
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:44,235
There won't be a problem, I am smart.

150
00:15:45,228 --> 00:15:49,357
Well, me too. You'll teach me.

151
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:50,800
Deal?

152
00:15:52,527 --> 00:15:55,389
How about that interview about your work?

153
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:56,664
Was it OK?

154
00:15:58,866 --> 00:15:59,793
Same as ususal.

155
00:16:03,288 --> 00:16:04,498
You know how they are.

156
00:16:15,217 --> 00:16:15,842
Where do you go?

157
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:19,329
I go for a piss.

158
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:32,061
"Without the slightest doubt there is love in this world.

159
00:16:32,061 --> 00:16:35,262
What worries me is how to express it". Osamu Dazai.

160
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:41,201
MODEL AGENCY MACCHIATO DULCE

161
00:16:54,548 --> 00:16:55,882
Hello? Is this you, Noeru?

162
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,427
What's up?

163
00:16:59,636 --> 00:17:02,013
Do you remember this interview for "Splash"?

164
00:17:02,931 --> 00:17:06,601
Sure! So? Some problem?

165
00:17:07,811 --> 00:17:09,072
This journalist...

166
00:17:09,072 --> 00:17:11,273
was very unpleasant.

167
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:16,678
He was dealing with me and my work with an arrogance...

168
00:17:17,487 --> 00:17:19,080
That is not OK.

169
00:17:21,116 --> 00:17:24,911
I will contact them right away.

170
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:26,455
You better will.

171
00:17:27,789 --> 00:17:30,041
Just tell him to step by for an apology.

172
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:32,335
Concerning what?

173
00:17:33,795 --> 00:17:39,801
I just want that he apologizes face to face.

174
00:17:40,502 --> 00:17:41,902
Are you sure?

175
00:17:46,308 --> 00:17:47,392
One moment, please.

176
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:49,144
Mr. Mamiya,

177
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:52,230
it's Mr. Ikari from Macchiato Dulce.

178
00:17:52,498 --> 00:17:54,232
Really? For me?

179
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,033
Yes!

180
00:18:02,775 --> 00:18:05,327
Hello? Mamiya speaking.

181
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,413
Yes, it's me.

182
00:18:13,001 --> 00:18:14,336
Could you be more specific?

183
00:18:15,545 --> 00:18:17,798
He really said that?

184
00:18:19,257 --> 00:18:20,634
Right, sir. I am sorry.

185
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,391
I understand. Yes, tonight.

186
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:31,436
OK. Tonight. Yes.

187
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:39,694
Mamiya. What did they want?

188
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,407
Oh, it's nothing.

189
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,432
You are late.

190
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,689
Don't stay there. Come in.

191
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:20,003
You want a drink?

192
00:20:21,838 --> 00:20:24,140
You shouldn't drink. You are a minor.

193
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:42,651
So, let it be.

194
00:20:48,198 --> 00:20:52,619
No. Don't be mean, Noeru.

195
00:20:53,537 --> 00:20:54,913
Now, out!

196
00:21:00,544 --> 00:21:03,672
I didn't see you here before.

197
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,510
Get out I said.

198
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:14,433
Alright.

199
00:21:17,811 --> 00:21:19,020
Call me whenever you want.

200
00:21:24,076 --> 00:21:25,110
Can't be.

201
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:31,875
What's this about?

202
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:34,286
I think it's quite obvious.

203
00:21:35,328 --> 00:21:36,413
I am not referring to that.

204
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:39,649
Why did you lie to make me come here?

205
00:21:40,584 --> 00:21:41,793
Otherwise you wouldn't have come.

206
00:21:43,462 --> 00:21:44,629
Ain't I right?

207
00:21:45,297 --> 00:21:48,175
What is it that you want? Why from me?

208
00:21:51,628 --> 00:21:53,513
I wanted to continue what we began.

209
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:57,934
Leave me alone!

210
00:22:03,106 --> 00:22:04,924
In that case I'll leave!

211
00:22:06,026 --> 00:22:07,486
Wait!

212
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,034
Are you sure?

213
00:22:41,019 --> 00:22:42,696
Are you telling me that you can't finish it?

214
00:22:44,648 --> 00:22:45,941
Yes, I am done for a 80%,

215
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,176
there are all the details.

216
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:49,861
I know it makes no sense.

217
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,664
But I can't finish it.

218
00:22:53,365 --> 00:22:54,466
You are not serious.

219
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:57,652
You are risking your job.

220
00:22:58,787 --> 00:23:01,823
I am a good writer, but this is too big for me.

221
00:23:02,541 --> 00:23:03,750
Listen, please.

222
00:23:05,752 --> 00:23:07,170
All the information is in there

223
00:23:08,296 --> 00:23:09,339
it just needs the final touch.

224
00:23:09,339 --> 00:23:10,198
Impossible!

225
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,219
We have no time. This article was yours!

226
00:23:18,849 --> 00:23:20,267
I implore you!

227
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,553
Well, you must have good reasons

228
00:23:31,553 --> 00:23:33,113
to be so persistant.

229
00:23:36,714 --> 00:23:37,814
Listen, Irie!

230
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:41,663
Take care of Mamiya's article.

231
00:23:43,507 --> 00:23:44,207
Impossible!

232
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,235
I am doing the VIP's gossip!

233
00:23:47,235 --> 00:23:49,129
So leave that shit.

234
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:54,301
Thank you, sir!

235
00:24:54,444 --> 00:24:55,654
What was going on with Noeru?

236
00:24:57,531 --> 00:24:58,723
You are a fool, you know?

237
00:25:04,329 --> 00:25:07,457
Are you seeing someone?

238
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:18,911
Look, don't do that!

239
00:25:18,911 --> 00:25:20,812
Don't be afraid.

240
00:25:24,641 --> 00:25:26,459
I wanted to continue what we began.

241
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:33,400
It's a present. Because I'm your first important job.

242
00:25:33,775 --> 00:25:35,251
Cheers.

243
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,336
Are you sure?

244
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:55,756
How dare you!

245
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:10,270
You know,

246
00:26:12,355 --> 00:26:14,941
you didn't write half of what I would have written.

247
00:26:15,734 --> 00:26:17,694
What? Really?

248
00:26:19,112 --> 00:26:20,730
Did you read it by chance?

249
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,431
Yes.

250
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:26,897
Come on...

251
00:26:26,897 --> 00:26:29,098
First, it was not even my article.

252
00:26:29,098 --> 00:26:31,249
You do your job, OK?

253
00:26:32,709 --> 00:26:33,543
I am sorry.

254
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:43,405
You want me?

255
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,093
Who are you?

256
00:29:26,594 --> 00:29:28,594
I... I just...

257
00:29:28,594 --> 00:29:30,229
Noeru isn't here.

258
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:40,105
You came looking for sex, right?

259
00:29:41,773 --> 00:29:44,359
No, I am writing for a magazine.

260
00:29:44,985 --> 00:29:46,153
I came to talk to him.

261
00:29:47,696 --> 00:29:49,114
Yeah, sure...

262
00:29:49,865 --> 00:29:51,992
But you are just like all the others.

263
00:29:52,951 --> 00:29:53,535
I am sorry,

264
00:29:54,036 --> 00:29:57,564
right now, Noeru is having sex with somebody else.

265
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,584
I can imagine.

266
00:30:02,169 --> 00:30:03,670
Are you his friend?

267
00:30:04,963 --> 00:30:07,049
That's not your business.

268
00:30:09,051 --> 00:30:10,135
Now I remember.

269
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:12,429
You were writing about his art.

270
00:30:18,852 --> 00:30:20,979
Did you write this article that came out recently?

271
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:24,566
Yes, I contributed.

272
00:30:26,068 --> 00:30:28,653
I read everything that is published about Noeru,

273
00:30:29,738 --> 00:30:31,281
but this article was the worst.

274
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,451
Could you be more specific?

275
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:38,513
You have absolutely no clue what his art is about.

276
00:30:39,247 --> 00:30:40,457
To what do you refer?

277
00:30:42,959 --> 00:30:46,421
"What called my attention about the work of N. Kisaragi…

278
00:30:47,214 --> 00:30:50,217
what his soft and exquisit mix of colours and lines.

279
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,719
His work reflects substancially

280
00:30:53,678 --> 00:30:54,471
the love of his public.

281
00:30:54,846 --> 00:31:01,969
His satisfaction and the feeling of being loved".

282
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,271
Isn't it correct?

283
00:31:04,189 --> 00:31:07,651
You don't know nothing about Noeru. Nothing.

284
00:31:09,319 --> 00:31:11,196
Well, that's what it seems.

285
00:31:13,532 --> 00:31:16,660
Noeru's work does not reflect feelings.

286
00:31:17,744 --> 00:31:20,831
He himself admits that.

287
00:31:24,835 --> 00:31:27,323
This one is the only that shows his feelings.

288
00:31:27,924 --> 00:31:30,624
It forms a part of his life.

289
00:31:32,393 --> 00:31:34,347
Really?

290
00:31:34,848 --> 00:31:37,148
Did he tell you that?

291
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:40,767
You seem a good guy.

292
00:31:41,852 --> 00:31:43,645
But you have not even a clue.

293
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:47,190
You know why he is painting?

294
00:31:48,191 --> 00:31:49,291
No.

295
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:52,946
For distraction.

296
00:31:53,488 --> 00:31:56,867
It's like laying down with a different guy every night.

297
00:31:58,035 --> 00:31:59,244
What do you mean?

298
00:32:01,705 --> 00:32:04,416
He is not happy.

299
00:32:06,209 --> 00:32:09,046
Especially when it comes to sex.

300
00:32:12,716 --> 00:32:14,593
He is always so sad.

301
00:32:17,095 --> 00:32:22,100
He just doesn't stop to draw these silly illustrations...

302
00:32:22,517 --> 00:32:24,519
and lay down with men for distraction.

303
00:32:29,107 --> 00:32:31,359
You like Noeru, right?

304
00:32:31,985 --> 00:32:35,583
If I like him? No.

305
00:32:36,084 --> 00:32:37,984
I love Noeru.

306
00:32:39,117 --> 00:32:42,045
So why do you allow him to lay down with others?

307
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,622
Because I believe in him.

308
00:32:45,624 --> 00:32:49,252
I believe that in the end he will choose me.

309
00:32:55,801 --> 00:32:57,219
Is this you in this drawing?

310
00:32:58,595 --> 00:33:00,180
Unfortunately, no.

311
00:33:01,056 --> 00:33:03,809
This is Ken, his friend from childhood.

312
00:33:06,186 --> 00:33:09,940
I know Noeru inside out.

313
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:16,154
He is more fragile and weak than anyone.

314
00:33:18,532 --> 00:33:21,576
Therefore, don't be to hard on him.

315
00:33:23,286 --> 00:33:26,748
"To love is to almost believe. Hugo".

316
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:05,912
Chidori has told me you were here.

317
00:34:07,122 --> 00:34:08,623
I knew you would come.

318
00:34:10,042 --> 00:34:11,960
After my three lengths you can make love to me.

319
00:34:23,263 --> 00:34:25,098
I didn't come for that.

320
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,560
I came to talk to you.

321
00:34:29,561 --> 00:34:31,980
I don't think I will become one of your conquests.

322
00:34:33,982 --> 00:34:36,777
I will not come to see you ever again.

323
00:34:38,236 --> 00:34:39,571
Neither will I work with you again.

324
00:34:44,284 --> 00:34:46,620
Chidori told me about you.

325
00:34:49,039 --> 00:34:53,318
He cares about you. Couldn't you quit to go with others?

326
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:59,091
You know you can't go on like that.

327
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,219
You know it, right?

328
00:35:07,349 --> 00:35:11,019
For your own good, quit fucking around.

329
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:30,247
I am done. Will you help me out?

330
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:34,418
It's not about you,

331
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:36,586
I do it for Chidori.

332
00:35:42,718 --> 00:35:43,218
You are the worst.

333
00:35:44,511 --> 00:35:45,887
Don't get mad.

334
00:35:46,471 --> 00:35:47,688
What's the point?

335
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:53,228
Alright, I will stop fooling around with others.

336
00:35:54,038 --> 00:35:57,232
But only if you are able to catch me.

337
00:35:58,150 --> 00:36:00,068
I am not a swimmer! Don't be absurd!

338
00:36:00,068 --> 00:36:01,569
Let's go!

339
00:36:10,454 --> 00:36:11,663
You want to fuck me, right?

340
00:36:12,581 --> 00:36:16,126
You are crazy! You are so wrong!

341
00:36:24,718 --> 00:36:25,844
Asshole!

342
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:13,910
You promised!

343
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,539
You had the face...! I thought you were dead!

344
00:38:19,791 --> 00:38:21,626
This is how we grown-ups do it.

345
00:38:25,589 --> 00:38:27,523
That way you tricked me.

346
00:38:28,759 --> 00:38:32,763
Promise. You will quit laying down with whoever.

347
00:38:34,765 --> 00:38:37,350
Now... We'll go for the second fase...

348
00:38:39,186 --> 00:38:43,531
As long people have friends to share their sadness...

349
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:48,532
it becomes easier to bear". Shakespeare.

350
00:40:09,568 --> 00:40:10,652
What's going on?

351
00:40:11,361 --> 00:40:12,737
What do you mean?

352
00:40:13,113 --> 00:40:15,657
Suddenly you decided to attend class?

353
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:18,535
A lot of things happened.

354
00:40:19,136 --> 00:40:20,454
What does that mean?

355
00:40:22,873 --> 00:40:23,832
Come on, tell me.

356
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,042
Nothing.

357
00:40:27,210 --> 00:40:29,880
Ah, before I forget...

358
00:40:30,797 --> 00:40:32,398
Here you have an article I wrote for you.

359
00:40:32,674 --> 00:40:35,135
Don't bother. I already delivered my own.

360
00:40:37,054 --> 00:40:39,139
I'm sorry for overloading you.

361
00:40:40,348 --> 00:40:43,159
I try hard to be a good student.

362
00:41:10,837 --> 00:41:14,383
I am in a very boring meeting.

363
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:42,619
This is work! Cheer up!

364
00:41:54,172 --> 00:41:57,426
I wish I could be as lazy as you.

365
00:42:14,818 --> 00:42:16,570
To work, my friend!

366
00:42:18,029 --> 00:42:26,079
"Wherever there is one of us the other is present". Hemingway.

367
00:42:42,012 --> 00:42:50,896
"In love there is only one law: to make your love happy". Stendhal.

368
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:56,527
One, two, three. One, two, three. Horrible!

369
00:42:57,128 --> 00:42:58,128
Listen!

370
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,546
Show me how it has to be! OK?

371
00:43:00,546 --> 00:43:04,117
I can't do it like that!

372
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,303
Look: one -- two -- three. Can you see?

373
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:10,082
Now we do understand. There we go...

374
00:43:10,957 --> 00:43:13,919
1, 2, 3 - 1, 2... Too fast!

375
00:43:21,343 --> 00:43:22,219
I can't any more.

376
00:43:23,637 --> 00:43:24,813
You need to practice.

377
00:43:26,673 --> 00:43:31,061
I never learned to swim.

378
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:35,615
But you are in good shape. Do you practice any sports?

379
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:38,918
Earlier I was boxing.

380
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:40,654
Really? For how long?

381
00:43:41,696 --> 00:43:42,823
Not much.

382
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,741
What does that mean?

383
00:43:45,742 --> 00:43:47,244
You don't know?

384
00:43:47,661 --> 00:43:48,328
No, should I?

385
00:43:50,288 --> 00:43:52,290
Will you teach me boxing?

386
00:43:55,001 --> 00:43:58,088
But at first chance I'll hit you low.

387
00:44:02,217 --> 00:44:03,385
What was that good for?

388
00:44:17,186 --> 00:44:22,686
This is a report about the most important hospitals of Tokio.

389
00:44:22,686 --> 00:44:26,887
I choose the most apropriate and we'll cover it right away.

390
00:45:03,771 --> 00:45:06,114
What is going on? Where are you going?

391
00:45:07,616 --> 00:45:08,408
Listen, Chidori.

392
00:45:36,061 --> 00:45:38,972
What is going on, Chidori? You changed a lot recently.

393
00:45:40,015 --> 00:45:41,658
You are the one who changed.

394
00:45:43,693 --> 00:45:44,736
And what is the problem?

395
00:45:47,322 --> 00:45:48,740
Let it go!

396
00:45:50,659 --> 00:45:54,454
What is going on, Chidori? This is not you.

397
00:45:57,999 --> 00:45:59,000
Leave me alone.

398
00:46:01,420 --> 00:46:04,712
"Jealousy is Amor's sister...

399
00:46:04,712 --> 00:46:09,177
just like Lucifer is a brother of the Angels". Boufflers.

400
00:47:03,565 --> 00:47:06,151
Chidori. What are you doing here at this time?

401
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,038
- He is here, right? - What?

402
00:47:09,038 --> 00:47:10,839
He is in there, right?

403
00:47:11,198 --> 00:47:12,365
What are you talking about?

404
00:47:12,991 --> 00:47:14,225
Don't try to fool me.

405
00:47:39,684 --> 00:47:41,836
Listen. I want to know what's going on.

406
00:47:43,271 --> 00:47:44,439
Where did you hide him?

407
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:46,233
What do you mean?

408
00:47:51,196 --> 00:47:52,239
It's all your fault.

409
00:47:52,940 --> 00:47:54,124
What are you talking about?

410
00:47:54,866 --> 00:47:57,244
About Noeru. Are you deaf?

411
00:47:59,471 --> 00:48:01,164
What? What is with him?

412
00:48:02,266 --> 00:48:06,169
How dare you! What's going on between you and Noeru?

413
00:48:07,754 --> 00:48:09,464
You are his new flame, right?

414
00:48:10,966 --> 00:48:12,092
You are very wrong.

415
00:48:13,135 --> 00:48:14,802
Noeru and me, we are more like...

416
00:48:17,305 --> 00:48:21,676
I know that you secretly went to bed with him.

417
00:48:23,437 --> 00:48:27,649
Let's get one thing straight: it is not what you think.

418
00:48:28,984 --> 00:48:31,111
So what kind of relationship is it?

419
00:48:32,028 --> 00:48:33,400
- It's... - You fell for Noeru.

420
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,698
That is what's going on.

421
00:48:38,702 --> 00:48:41,705
I will never allow that he'll be yours.

422
00:49:27,167 --> 00:49:28,251
This is you!

423
00:49:28,919 --> 00:49:30,754
For a moment I was worried.

424
00:49:32,714 --> 00:49:36,000
I thought you were a ghost.

425
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,988
If you have something to say, say it.

426
00:49:41,306 --> 00:49:43,892
We have a special relationship.

427
00:49:46,228 --> 00:49:47,404
What do we have in special?

428
00:49:49,773 --> 00:49:52,484
We are friends since we were little. You don't draw any more.

429
00:49:54,236 --> 00:49:56,287
I was quite busy...

430
00:49:59,074 --> 00:50:02,786
How? It's gone!

431
00:50:06,248 --> 00:50:07,794
Where is it?

432
00:50:07,794 --> 00:50:11,695
You know how important it is for me, right?!

433
00:50:11,695 --> 00:50:12,421
He took it.

434
00:50:13,797 --> 00:50:14,881
Where did you take it?

435
00:50:15,549 --> 00:50:16,992
Let it go. You don't need it anymore.

436
00:50:16,992 --> 00:50:20,929
Neither do you need me.

437
00:50:24,516 --> 00:50:25,684
Don't be stupid!

438
00:50:26,476 --> 00:50:29,297
Hit me. Come on, punch me.

439
00:50:29,297 --> 00:50:30,998
It will make you feel better.

440
00:50:35,026 --> 00:50:36,486
come on! What will you do now?

441
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:38,321
Tell me what you are thinking.

442
00:50:40,699 --> 00:50:42,826
You want that little reporter, right?

443
00:50:43,827 --> 00:50:44,827
What?

444
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:46,955
Be honest.

445
00:50:53,128 --> 00:50:53,795
I want him.

446
00:50:53,795 --> 00:50:55,547
And what about Ken?

447
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:04,312
Noeru, I love you.

448
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:08,013
I loved you since Ken.

449
00:51:08,214 --> 00:51:11,314
You can't do anything without me.

450
00:51:15,692 --> 00:51:18,779
We are made for each other.

451
00:51:22,532 --> 00:51:25,243
You always come back to me.

452
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,455
I am the best you can have.

453
00:51:29,581 --> 00:51:31,416
Together we can succeed everything!

454
00:51:32,334 --> 00:51:34,335
You have only me! Wake up!

455
00:51:37,547 --> 00:51:40,636
I am the one who wants you most...

456
00:51:41,137 --> 00:51:43,637
in this world.

457
00:51:52,687 --> 00:51:57,442
You have to believe me. It's the truth.

458
00:52:03,043 --> 00:52:04,543
For me...

459
00:52:05,944 --> 00:52:08,044
you are a friend.

460
00:52:08,044 --> 00:52:10,344
It's good for you to draw.

461
00:52:11,745 --> 00:52:13,345
You are talented.

462
00:52:13,823 --> 00:52:15,627
Not more nor less.

463
00:52:31,351 --> 00:52:41,192
 "Sometimes it's better to be wrong about your motives than to listen to the truth". La Rochefoucauld.

464
00:53:34,598 --> 00:53:36,089
Are you fine?

465
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:42,290
Are you hungry? Will you come to my place?

466
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:18,291
Don't try to resist!

467
00:54:18,291 --> 00:54:19,292
Stop it now!

468
00:54:24,214 --> 00:54:24,923
Please, no.

469
00:54:25,674 --> 00:54:27,670
You are hurting me!

470
00:54:28,971 --> 00:54:32,071
Don't you know who I am?

471
00:54:35,984 --> 00:54:39,271
You are nothing. Who cares?

472
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:52,159
Stop it! Not in the face!

473
00:55:42,376 --> 00:55:45,629
You know, I cancelled all your appointments.

474
00:55:55,847 --> 00:55:58,141
What the hell were you thinking?!

475
00:56:04,398 --> 00:56:08,151
You are already punished. Take care.

476
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:33,452
Taishin Mamiya.

477
00:56:52,853 --> 00:56:55,453
Noeru Kisaragi.

478
00:56:58,054 --> 00:57:00,754
Mamiya, is that article OK with you?

479
00:57:01,913 --> 00:57:02,664
Yes, sir.

480
00:59:52,209 --> 00:59:57,128
Career of Noeru Kisaragi stopped after brutal attack.

481
01:01:38,816 --> 01:01:42,359
You chose a very bad moment. We were having a great time.

482
01:01:42,987 --> 01:01:44,571
What do you have in your face?

483
01:01:46,482 --> 01:01:48,538
Now I have a lot of free time.

484
01:01:51,639 --> 01:01:54,539
You are hopeless,

485
01:01:55,140 --> 01:01:57,240
you don't even know to keep a promise.

486
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,004
That's true.

487
01:01:59,004 --> 01:02:02,005
You knew it right from the beginning, right?

488
01:02:03,883 --> 01:02:06,217
What is it what you want?

489
01:02:07,569 --> 01:02:11,264
Here you are useless. Get lost.

490
01:02:13,333 --> 01:02:14,768
Why are you doing this?

491
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:19,064
Why didn't you keep our promise?

492
01:02:20,899 --> 01:02:22,530
Our promise?

493
01:02:22,931 --> 01:02:26,231
Promises are made to be broken.

494
01:02:26,231 --> 01:02:27,281
No.

495
01:02:29,206 --> 01:02:31,742
They are made to be kept.

496
01:02:33,537 --> 01:02:36,790
All our relationship depends from this promise.

497
01:02:39,793 --> 01:02:41,461
And now you spoiled it all.

498
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:45,173
You are stupid.

499
01:02:48,427 --> 01:02:50,303
Only idiots believe in promises.

500
01:02:52,097 --> 01:02:53,306
I decided to never believe...

501
01:02:54,933 --> 01:02:55,726
in promises.

502
01:02:58,270 --> 01:02:59,229
What are you refering to?

503
01:03:04,985 --> 01:03:08,405
Ken didn't keep his promise.

504
01:03:10,983 --> 01:03:13,079
He promised that...

505
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:17,080
he would be with me.

506
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:20,876
He didn't keep his word.

507
01:03:22,294 --> 01:03:23,675
Ken?

508
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:28,776
You mean the guy from your drawing?

509
01:03:28,776 --> 01:03:31,094
Who told you that?

510
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,055
Chidori.

511
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,361
When we met for the first time.

512
01:03:41,104 --> 01:03:43,747
In school they bullied us, Chidori and me.

513
01:03:43,747 --> 01:03:48,820
Ken was older, he defended us.

514
01:03:51,364 --> 01:03:53,533
He was very tender.

515
01:04:08,266 --> 01:04:09,066
Take.

516
01:04:10,467 --> 01:04:11,301
Thanks.

517
01:04:17,674 --> 01:04:19,001
You draw very well.

518
01:04:19,001 --> 01:04:21,761
Ken was strong and tender. He was great.

519
01:04:22,687 --> 01:04:24,314
I miss him.

520
01:04:26,733 --> 01:04:29,653
He always praised my drawings.

521
01:04:31,405 --> 01:04:35,200
I drew because I liked to make him smile.

522
01:04:40,497 --> 01:04:44,126
Take, it's yours. That you get better soon.

523
01:04:44,793 --> 01:04:45,711
You like wales, right?

524
01:04:47,546 --> 01:04:50,124
You are good at drawing.

525
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,700
Did you ever see the ocean?

526
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:53,552
No, never. You?

527
01:04:54,428 --> 01:04:56,595
No. When I'm grown up, we'll go togethr.

528
01:04:56,595 --> 01:04:58,765
This is our promise.

529
01:04:59,033 --> 01:05:02,352
Really? Is it a promise?

530
01:05:03,562 --> 01:05:05,147
Yes, I promise.

531
01:05:07,199 --> 01:05:09,194
Soon, one week later...

532
01:05:09,995 --> 01:05:12,195
Ken died.

533
01:05:13,905 --> 01:05:15,732
He did not keep his promise.

534
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:23,373
This was the first time that I realized what I wanted.

535
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:26,507
But...

536
01:05:27,769 --> 01:05:30,090
when you love somebody...

537
01:05:30,591 --> 01:05:32,591
is it so sad...

538
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:38,202
And if, to want somebody...

539
01:05:38,803 --> 01:05:41,603
hurts me so much...

540
01:05:42,547 --> 01:05:45,226
I don't want to...

541
01:05:47,127 --> 01:05:49,327
feel love any more.

542
01:05:50,427 --> 01:05:53,027
I won't believe in promises any more.

Mamiya, come with me.

551
01:09:39,337 --> 01:09:40,464
What's up?

552
01:09:45,969 --> 01:09:49,347
They've called from the Models' Agency to complain about you.

553
01:09:50,517 --> 01:09:53,727
You do know, why, no? Don't oblige me to say it.

554
01:09:54,186 --> 01:09:54,978
I believe in you.

555
01:09:59,191 --> 01:10:01,442
If you deny it, I will defend you.

556
01:10:05,989 --> 01:10:09,242
Tell me that it's not true.

557
01:10:10,077 --> 01:10:10,869
I will support you.

558
01:10:13,455 --> 01:10:15,039
I am sorry.

559
01:10:17,793 --> 01:10:19,819
I shouldn't bother you any more.

560
01:10:20,504 --> 01:10:21,980
This is my business.

561
01:10:22,523 --> 01:10:23,990
Are you serious?

562
01:10:24,991 --> 01:10:26,491
Yes.

565
01:10:58,166 --> 01:11:00,834
What does this mean, Noeru?

566
01:11:05,090 --> 01:11:06,841
You told them everything.

567
01:11:46,275 --> 01:11:47,675
Hello!?

568
01:11:49,676 --> 01:11:51,845
I was informed that you lost your job.

569
01:11:53,889 --> 01:11:55,891
Come on, the news already spread?

570
01:11:58,602 --> 01:11:59,853
It was my fault.

571
01:12:00,312 --> 01:12:04,500
Don't be silly. It wasn't your fault.

572
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,069
I decided to quit.

573
01:12:07,195 --> 01:12:08,271
Don't lie!

574
01:12:09,072 --> 01:12:11,572
It's true. Don't worry.

575
01:12:12,864 --> 01:12:14,201
The decision was mine.

576
01:12:16,953 --> 01:12:19,831
I guess you are at school, no?

577
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:22,250
What will you do now?

578
01:12:23,293 --> 01:12:26,713
Life goes on. I will find a new job.

579
01:12:27,114 --> 01:12:28,052
That's not what I mean...

580
01:12:30,353 --> 01:12:32,053
I mean us.

581
01:12:34,304 --> 01:12:36,389
It won't change anything.

582
01:12:40,227 --> 01:12:42,562
That's what I needed to hear.

583
01:12:47,559 --> 01:12:51,446
Were you concerned? How stupid.

584
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:55,951
Don't lose more time. Go back to your class.

585
01:12:58,620 --> 01:12:59,871
Alright, I will.

586
01:13:01,915 --> 01:13:02,499
I did it.

587
01:13:03,125 --> 01:13:05,969
I have an exclusive about the actress that Arai is dating secretly.

588
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:07,003
What do you think?

589
01:13:07,838 --> 01:13:10,247
Satoshi Arai? The famous?

590
01:13:10,247 --> 01:13:12,759
I called him and he confirmed.

591
01:13:13,301 --> 01:13:16,179
I think, he must be much in love.

592
01:13:16,179 --> 01:13:17,947
With his own words.

593
01:13:17,947 --> 01:13:19,448
- Are you sure? - Totally.

594
01:13:19,448 --> 01:13:21,650
Ask for declarations from their agencies.

595
01:13:21,650 --> 01:13:23,110
We won't accept a "no comment".

596
01:13:23,110 --> 01:13:23,611
OK!

597
01:13:23,611 --> 01:13:24,612
It's the big news of the week.

598
01:13:24,612 --> 01:13:26,780
Awsome!

599
01:13:36,366 --> 01:13:37,242
What do you think of this one?

600
01:13:37,943 --> 01:13:38,493
Which?

601
01:13:38,827 --> 01:13:39,577
This one.

602
01:13:42,998 --> 01:13:45,626
"Employees needed by Macchiato Dulce".

603
01:13:45,626 --> 01:13:47,936
That's your agency!

604
01:13:47,936 --> 01:13:49,037
They would kill me.

605
01:13:49,037 --> 01:13:51,072
Nothing like that. Send your curriculum.

606
01:13:51,072 --> 01:13:53,675
Impossible. I never could be your agent.

607
01:13:53,675 --> 01:13:54,718
You are a chicken.

608
01:13:58,346 --> 01:13:59,372
You are losing your rhythm.

609
01:14:00,140 --> 01:14:02,668
Shut up! I'll do it my way...

610
01:14:02,668 --> 01:14:04,919
I need a sandsack that's human.

611
01:14:05,687 --> 01:14:06,772
I got you!

612
01:14:07,289 --> 01:14:09,382
I'll get you, asshole!

"Since she wanted me, I ask myself up to what point I became more respectable". Goethe

614
01:15:06,498 --> 01:15:06,873
Coming!

615
01:15:16,616 --> 01:15:18,710
Sorry for being late. It's because of the job interview.

616
01:15:18,710 --> 01:15:19,511
Take!

617
01:15:19,511 --> 01:15:22,721
You bought a cake? This is not like you.

618
01:15:23,056 --> 01:15:23,432
It for celebrating.

619
01:15:24,224 --> 01:15:25,341
What?

620
01:15:25,684 --> 01:15:27,060
They gave me the job.

621
01:15:27,853 --> 01:15:30,230
Really? Great!

622
01:15:31,606 --> 01:15:32,858
I'll put some candles.

623
01:15:33,692 --> 01:15:35,643
Don't even think about it. It's not your birthday.

624
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,032
Looks great!

625
01:15:43,660 --> 01:15:44,369
Yummy!

626
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:52,588
Wait!

627
01:15:52,588 --> 01:15:55,189
Come. Sit down!

628
01:15:55,189 --> 01:15:55,890
For what?

629
01:15:55,890 --> 01:15:57,715
Do as I say!

630
01:15:57,715 --> 01:16:00,626
Today, in order to celebrate I will draw you.

631
01:16:02,137 --> 01:16:03,805
I am far to shy to be a Model.

632
01:16:04,081 --> 01:16:06,875
It's an honour, you should be happy.

633
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:14,132
How will I put myself?

634
01:16:15,358 --> 01:16:16,276
Do you have a preferred pose?

635
01:16:19,571 --> 01:16:20,781
Not really!

636
01:16:22,699 --> 01:16:24,742
So do however you like.

637
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:31,958
I'm embarrassed.

638
01:16:33,168 --> 01:16:36,630
How come? We do know already.

639
01:16:37,756 --> 01:16:40,133
What do you want to say by that?

640
01:16:41,218 --> 01:16:44,346
You have been with worse guys, no?

641
01:16:47,557 --> 01:16:48,058
Let me see.

642
01:16:48,642 --> 01:16:49,101
Over my dead body.

643
01:16:49,893 --> 01:16:50,227
Come on, show me!

644
01:16:54,064 --> 01:16:54,731
I am naked!

645
01:16:55,690 --> 01:16:56,233
That's how you turn me on.

646
01:16:57,726 --> 01:16:59,743
- Get it! - Great, isn't it?

647
01:17:05,867 --> 01:17:06,535
Chidori.

648
01:18:01,465 --> 01:18:02,185
Noeru!

649
01:18:04,301 --> 01:18:06,219
