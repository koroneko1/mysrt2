[Pip] Once upon a time
in a magical kingdom called Andalasia,

9
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,291
a baby was found in the forest.

10
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,375
With no mother or father to speak of,

11
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:08,583
the baby was raised by the animals,
who loved her as one of their own.

12
00:01:08,666 --> 00:01:11,958
-[babbles]
-[Pip] And her name was Giselle.

13
00:01:13,041 --> 00:01:15,916
Giselle grew into a beautiful young lady…

00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,166

00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:43,583

39
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:38,166
This story begins
where the old one left off:

40
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,916
in the kingdom of New York
after "happily ever after."

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,791
After? But there is no after,
after "happily ever after."

42
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:51,250
Yeah. You just get married
then nothing ever happens to you again.

43
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:53,166
Oh, not in this world.

44
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,791
Over there,
things would never stop happening.

45
00:02:55,875 --> 00:02:58,166
For Giselle, a few years went by.

46
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,875
Morgan sprouted up, and eventually,
Robert and Giselle had a baby.

47
00:03:02,958 --> 00:03:05,583
A beautiful girl named Sofia.

48
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,916
And for one moment,
Giselle truly had it all.

49
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:13,375
And that's when things began to change.

50
00:03:13,916 --> 00:03:18,416
{\an8}First, with all the baby stuff,
their castle in the sky shrunk two sizes.

51
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,375
Then, life got so busy,

52
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:23,833
it felt like a sleeping curse
fell over them every single night.

53
00:03:24,416 --> 00:03:27,166
But the hardest part of all was Morgan.

54
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:31,791
She became what that world calls
a "teenager."

55
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:36,041
And it felt to Giselle
that she had set out to a faraway place

56
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:37,750
where she could never go.

57
00:03:38,375 --> 00:03:41,041
With so much change,
Giselle started feeling

58
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:45,000
{\an8}that life in the kingdom of New York
wasn't such a fairy tale after all.

59
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:49,583
And that's when she saw… a sign.

60
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:51,375
{\an8}And, suddenly, she realized

61
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:54,458
{\an8}their happily-ever-after
might be somewhere else.

62
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:59,541
So, Giselle and Robert began their quest
for a new happily-ever-after.

63

but it can also be exciting.

00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,125
And once you've found where you fit,

506
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:47,166
Monroeville can be whatever you wish.

508
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:52,625
You know, I think you're right.

[crickets chirping]

510
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,375
Oh, I'm so glad you like it.

511
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,083
Do you think we should add music?

512
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:04,916
-Oh.
-[door opens, slams]

513
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,458
[gasps] Oh.

514
00:25:06,541 --> 00:25:09,625
Hi, Morgan. How did it go?

515
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:10,875
It was fine.

516
00:25:12,291 --> 00:25:13,291
[Morgan sighs]

517
00:25:25,083 --> 00:25:26,708
Does this mean it didn't go well?

518
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,833
Well, no one talked to me all day,
so I got a lot of me-time. That was nice.

519
00:25:30,916 --> 00:25:31,750
Oh.

520
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,708
Yes, that was sarcasm. My day sucked.

521
00:25:38,458 --> 00:25:41,958
Well, this isn't anything
a little glitter couldn't fix.

522
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:43,625
It's old anyway. What's the point?

523
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:48,041
The point is, is that it's a memory tree,
and as we say in Andalasia--

524
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:51,125
"Memories are the most powerful magic
of all." I know.

525
00:25:51,208 --> 00:25:53,125
I'm not really sure
it works the same way here.

526
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,166
-Morgan.
-[sighs]

527
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,833
I know you didn't want to come here.

528
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,791
But if you give it a chance,
it will get better.

529
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:05,875
What if it doesn't?

530
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:08,750
I should go back to school in New York.
I can take the train with Dad.

531
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,250
-It'll be fine.
-It's only been a day.

532
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,041
We just have to figure out
where you fit in.

533
00:26:15,125 --> 00:26:17,083
We won't do anything, okay?

534
00:26:17,708 --> 00:26:20,541
If I'm gonna do this,
then I have to do it myself, all right?

535
00:26:20,625 --> 00:26:21,500
Okay.

536
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,166
I'm not a little girl anymore.

537
00:26:23,875 --> 00:26:24,875
-I got this.
-Mm-hmm.

I have a wonderful idea."

Vote for Morgan. She is new here.

548
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,541
And she makes a great friend.

-[Giselle] I'm glad you like them.

There you go. Vote for Morgan. [giggles]

551
00:27:34,541 --> 00:27:35,916
What are you doing?

552
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,791
Oh, well, I was just thinking,

553
00:27:37,875 --> 00:27:40,416
in Andalasia,
we have festivals all the time,

554
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:43,041
and everybody knows
the prince and the princess.

555
00:27:43,125 --> 00:27:44,375
And now everyone will know you.

556
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:47,833
Yes, but I told you
that I could figure this out on my own.

557
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,041
[gasps]

558
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,458
Why won't you let me do that? [huffs]

559
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:55,541
-Morgan. Morgan.
-[Rosaleen] Oh.

560
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:58,416
I'm sorry, Giselle, but you can't have
a table on school property

561
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,333
unless you're an official member
of a committee.

562
00:28:00,416 --> 00:28:02,500
Oh, well, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

563
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:04,083
Well, now you do.

564
00:28:04,166 --> 00:28:06,541
-Ladies.
-Gladly.

565
00:28:06,625 --> 00:28:07,750
Excuse me.

566
00:28:08,916 --> 00:28:10,916
-Oh, these cupcakes look incredible!
-[pants]

567
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,375

[ticking]

569
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:17,083
[Robert] She's never been this late
without calling.

570
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,583
I think she's turned off her phone.

571
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,000
-[sighs] That's it. She's grounded.
-[typing on cell phone]

572
00:28:24,166 --> 00:28:26,333
Do you remember when we made this?

573
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:31,916
She used to beg me for stories
from Andalasia every night,

574
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,500
and her favorite ones were always
about the Magical Memory Tree.

575
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,416
She used to love those.

576
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:40,291
I don't know what happened.

577
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:42,041
Oh, nothing happened.

578
00:28:42,125 --> 00:28:44,666
Teenagers do this all the time.
That's all it is.

579
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:46,750
It's more than that.

580
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:52,708
I never sing the right song anymore,

581
00:28:53,291 --> 00:28:56,791
and even when I make cupcakes,
everything goes wrong.

582
00:28:56,875 --> 00:28:58,958
I used to be good at things.

583
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,000
[sighs] Things will get better.
Just give it a second.

584
00:29:07,458 --> 00:29:08,875
[both chuckle]

585
00:29:08,958 --> 00:29:11,000
Robert, are you happy here?

586

[stammers]

587
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,333
We just got here.

588
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,708
[sighs] Hmm.

589
00:29:19,083 --> 00:29:23,083
When is the last time
that you were truly happy?

590
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,583
Uh, well…

591
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,083
It's not that I'm unhappy.

592
00:29:31,375 --> 00:29:32,833
It just-- Sometimes I wonder if--

593
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,625
if time's just slipping away,

594
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:42,333
and I'll be riding a train over and over
and over again for the rest of my life.

[door closes]

-Oh, Morgan.
-What-- Where have you been?

597
00:29:46,541 --> 00:29:48,666
-I went to New York.
-By yourself?

598
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:52,000
I've been riding the subway alone
since I was 13. Let's calm down, please.

599
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:54,375
Don't tell me to calm down.

600
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:56,125
-What were you thinking?
-I don't know, Dad.

601
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,791
I was thinking, though, maybe
you should have left me where I belong.

602
00:29:58,875 --> 00:30:00,166
You belong here.

603
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,708
No, I don't!

604
00:30:01,791 --> 00:30:06,666
Look, I know that you want to live in some
perfect fairy-tale land, but we don't.

605
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,458
-Okay? We live here…
-If you want to be mad, you be mad at me.

606
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,791
-…in this stupid town, and I hate it!
-But do not talk to your mother like that!

607
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:14,083
My mother?

608
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,083
Mm-hmm.

609
00:30:15,166 --> 00:30:16,500
She is not my mother.

610
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,208
She's my stepmother.

611
00:30:20,208 --> 00:30:22,500
-That's all she'll ever be.

Stepmother?

613
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,416
[Robert] She didn't mean that.

614
00:30:25,916 --> 00:30:27,958

00:44:00,791 --> 00:44:01,875
How do I look?

856
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:03,708
[gasps]

857
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:07,791
-Oh, Morgan. You look wonderful.
-[Morgan laughs]

858
00:44:07,875 --> 00:44:09,666
What do you think?

859
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:12,500
-It's beautiful.
-Then we'll take it.

860
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,250
-[chuckles]
-You really don't have to do that.

861
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,666
I'm sure it's very expensive.

862
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:16,833
Of course, I do.

863
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:19,416
I've always dreamed
of sharing a night like this with you,

864
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,958
-and it's going to be perfect.
-[chuckles]

865
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,208
Now we just need shoes.

866
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:24,625
[both laugh]

867
00:44:24,708 --> 00:44:25,833
[laughs]

868
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:28,583
[horse whinnies]

869
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,375
Hmm.

870
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,750
So, Miss Giselle,
we must find a dress for you too.

871
00:44:41,833 --> 00:44:44,083
Oh, no. Thank you. I'm fine.

872
00:44:44,166 --> 00:44:45,583
Nonsense!

873
00:44:45,666 --> 00:44:50,583
These are one of a kind:
hand dipped in actual fairy dust.

874
00:44:50,666 --> 00:44:52,125
You will twinkle like a star.

875
00:44:52,208 --> 00:44:55,666
Oh, that is a very aggressive twinkle,
but I really don't need--

876
00:44:55,750 --> 00:44:57,291
[bell tolls]

877
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:02,708
Hmm.

878
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:05,125
[babbles]

879
00:45:06,708 --> 00:45:08,333
[salesperson] Miss Giselle?

880
00:45:10,166 --> 00:45:12,666
Miss Giselle, is everything okay?

881
00:45:15,333 --> 00:45:18,750
You know, I was just thinking.

882
00:45:19,375 --> 00:45:22,708
I really do have a figure for fashion.

883
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:26,208
The finest hourglass
would shatter with envy.

884
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:28,083
Oh. [chuckles]

885
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:30,666
Let's try them all.

886
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:32,250
[both laugh]

887
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:35,625
[both panting]

888
00:45:35,708 --> 00:45:36,916
Ooh. Oh.

889
00:45:38,458 --> 00:45:39,833
[Sofia giggles]

890
00:45:44,791 --> 00:45:46,916
[gags] What is that smell?

891
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,958
Oh, hey, it's me. You know why?
I fell into a gutter!

892
00:45:50,041 --> 00:45:51,666
[gasps] Oh!

893
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,541
Geez, you buy the whole town?

894
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:56,458
Well… [scoffs] …it's not all for me.

895
00:45:56,541 --> 00:45:57,833
Hmm. Is that so?

896
00:45:57,916 --> 00:46:02,666
Picture our Morgan, the belle of the ball…

897
00:46:04,666 --> 00:46:05,750
in this!

898
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,333
Huh?

899
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,041
[Morgan] Oh.

900
00:46:11,583 --> 00:46:12,583
Well…

901
00:46:12,666 --> 00:46:14,000
Well?

902
00:46:16,416 --> 00:46:19,375
Ooh. Okay. [muttering]

903
00:46:19,458 --> 00:46:21,666
-[babbles]
-[Rosaleen whispers] Over to the right.

904
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,208
[mutters, grunts]

905
00:46:23,291 --> 00:46:24,708
-[Sofia giggles]
-[groans]

906
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:30,083
It looks… different in this light.

907
00:46:30,916 --> 00:46:34,166
It's definitely air-conditioned!

908
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:35,291
Oh! [pants]

909
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,625
What happened? It's torn to shreds.

910
00:46:39,708 --> 00:46:42,125
Why, it's hardly fit for a maid.

911
00:46:42,208 --> 00:46:44,041
Not exactly how I would've put it.

912
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:45,166
[scoffs]

913
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:47,083
What? It was a little judgy.

914
00:46:47,666 --> 00:46:50,208
-[Morgan] Well, perhaps I can mend it.
-[Giselle] No. No mending.

915
00:46:50,291 --> 00:46:51,291
I got it. [grunts]

916
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:54,125
[Giselle] I'll just march right down there
and demand an explanation.

917
00:46:54,916 --> 00:46:57,541
-[squeals]
-Okay, well, I'm off to market,

918
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:00,666
and then I'll have plenty of time
to get ready for the festival.

919
00:47:00,750 --> 00:47:02,083
-[Morgan chuckles]
-Mm-hmm.

920
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:04,291
-Oh!
-Hmm?

921
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:07,208
Thank you for everything, Stepmother.

922
00:47:13,375 --> 00:47:14,458
Stepmother?

923
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:16,333
[gasps]

924
00:47:17,541 --> 00:47:18,750
Oh, no.

925
00:47:19,375 --> 00:47:20,375
What?

926
00:47:20,458 --> 00:47:21,541
[gasps]

927
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:23,541
-What?
-Oh! [gasps]

928
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:26,333
My hair, it's so high,
and my dress is so low.

929
00:47:26,416 --> 00:47:28,791
And of course,
I want that dress to be made of rags.

930
00:47:28,875 --> 00:47:30,416
People like me always do.

931
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,375
People like who?
What are you talking about?

932
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,125
Oh, no, Pip.

933
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:37,375
I'm afraid that my wish
is turning me into a-- [gasps]

934
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:38,291
A what?

935
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:40,708
It's turning me into a… [gasps]

936
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,666
A what?

937
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:43,083
[breathes shakily]

938
00:47:44,166 --> 00:47:45,833
A wicked stepmother. [gasps]

939
00:47:45,916 --> 00:47:48,041
What? Come on!

940
00:47:48,625 --> 00:47:49,833
[gasps]

941
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:52,166
Oh, actually. Yeah. No.
No, no, I can totally see it.

942
00:47:52,750 --> 00:47:54,791
Oh, no. [gasps] Oh, Pip!

943
00:47:56,041 --> 00:47:58,625
[Pip] Uh, hey, slow down!
Where are we going?

944
00:48:00,708 --> 00:48:01,708
[gasps]

945
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:09,375
Who lives in this rat hole?

946
00:48:09,958 --> 00:48:11,208
Morgan does.

947
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:14,750
Stepdaughters always live
in attics or dungeons.

948
00:48:14,833 --> 00:48:17,000
Oh, Pip, do you know what this means?

949
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:19,416
I am the villain of Monrolasia!

950
00:48:19,500 --> 00:48:21,416
Well, you're not the only villain.

951
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,458
Well, that's silly.
There can only ever be one villain.

952
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:27,541
Not counting minions or pets.

953
00:48:28,375 --> 00:48:30,916
Or villains that you don't know
are villains until it's too late.

954
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,875
[Pip] Well, Monrolasia might be different.

955
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:37,125
'Cause there's you,
and then there's that evil queen you made.

956
00:48:37,208 --> 00:48:39,333
Who, Malvina? She's not evil. She's--

957
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,375
Uh, did you see that outfit?

958
00:48:41,458 --> 00:48:45,375
With the big gestures and the crazy eyes!

959
00:48:46,666 --> 00:48:48,166
Oh, no.

960
00:48:48,250 --> 00:48:51,416
So, you better unwish that wish quick
before she, uh--

961
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,958
-[stomach rumbling]
-[groans]

962
00:48:53,041 --> 00:48:54,041
-[Pip burps]
-Pip?

963
00:48:54,125 --> 00:48:56,750
[grunts, groans] I don't feel so--

964
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,833
-[stomach rumbling]
-[burps]

965
00:48:58,916 --> 00:49:00,125
What's wrong?

966
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:01,708
[grunts, burps]

967
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:04,750
[groans, screams]

968
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:05,833
[grunts]

969
00:49:05,916 --> 00:49:08,291
-Oh! Oh.
-[Pip groaning, meowing]

970
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:09,333

00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:10,791
[groans, hisses]

972
00:49:10,875 --> 00:49:11,875
[screams]

973
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:13,791
-[grunting, groaning]
-[Giselle] Oh, Pip.

974
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:17,166
Wicked stepmothers don't have
cute chipmunks as friends. They have--

975
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:20,208
Cats! [meows] And evil ones! [yowls]

976
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:24,958
Oh, I can't be an evil cat.
They eat chipmunks!

977
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:27,083
Oh, I'm gonna be sick!

978
00:49:27,166 --> 00:49:28,375
[retching]

979
00:49:28,458 --> 00:49:29,583
[Pip retches]

980
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:35,875
Surely there's an adventure
out here somewhere.

981
00:49:36,583 --> 00:49:37,791
[villager screams]

982
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:39,375
A bellow of distress.

983
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:41,041
[grunts]

984
00:49:41,125 --> 00:49:42,666
Finally! [chuckles]

985
00:49:42,750 --> 00:49:44,333
[villager 1] What are we to do?

986
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,666
[villager 2] I'm not going in there.
You go in.

987
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:48,708
[villager 3]
Well, I'm certainly not going in there.

988
00:49:48,791 --> 00:49:50,083
Are you a dragon slayer?

989
00:49:50,166 --> 00:49:51,166
I believe I am.

990
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,833
-[villagers scream]
-Ooh.

991
00:49:53,916 --> 00:49:57,125
Never fear. I shall slay the beast.

992
00:49:57,208 --> 00:49:59,750
I wouldn't if I were you.
It is very large.

993
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:02,083
-Oh.
-And cranky.

994
00:50:02,166 --> 00:50:06,791
Hmm. A very large and cranky dragon is
just what I've been looking for.

995
00:50:07,458 --> 00:50:08,458
Won't be a moment.

996
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:11,708
-Onward, my sweetness.

00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:25,291
Have you done this before?

[chuckles]

1003
00:50:27,083 --> 00:50:32,375
Have-- Of course, yes, I have--
I have slain many a dragon.

1004

[dragon snarls]

1005
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,708

-[groans] Ow. Oh, oh.

1011
00:50:51,083 --> 00:50:54,083
-[dragon laughing]
-Hot. That's hot.

1012
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:56,583
I shall persevere.

1013
00:50:57,458 --> 00:50:59,750
I shall conquer the craven beast!

1014
00:50:59,833 --> 00:51:01,208
-[stone rumbles]
-I shall--

1015
00:51:03,416 --> 00:51:04,416
[villager 6] Hey!

1016
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:08,291
No offense, sir, but you might want
to find another profession.

1017
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:09,666
[villager chuckles]

1018

[gasps]

1019
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:22,125
Uh, what are you doing?

1020
00:51:22,208 --> 00:51:25,791
Nancy said if we had any problems,
all we had to do was ask.

1021
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:29,291
Welcome to your magical
wishing wand experience!

1022
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,875
-If you should ever have a question…
-Oh.

1023
00:51:30,958 --> 00:51:33,625
…just ask, and I shall appear.

1024
00:51:33,708 --> 00:51:36,333
-[laughs] Hello!
-Hey, we got no time for this.

1025
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:37,750
[screams] Good kitty. Good kitty.

1026
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:40,208
I'm sorry. My friend's a little anxious

1027
00:51:40,291 --> 00:51:43,291
because we need to undo a wish
as soon as possible.

1028
00:51:43,375 --> 00:51:44,916
Oh. Didn't like what you got, huh?

1029
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,041
Well, I wished for a fairy-tale life,

1030
00:51:48,125 --> 00:51:50,625
and it made my town
a place like Andalasia.

1031
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:54,208
And now I'm slowly turning
into a wicked stepmother.

1032
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:56,583
And I'm her soon-to-be-evil cat.

1033
00:51:56,666 --> 00:51:58,791
-[groans]
-Oh! [laughs]

1034
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:02,250
Oh, you changed the world.
What? You changed the world!

1035
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,750
Do you know how much magic
it takes to make that happen?

1036
00:52:04,833 --> 00:52:05,666
-[meows]
-Whoo!

1037
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,333
Where do you think
all that magic comes from, hmm?

1038
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,291
Andalasia, that's where.

1039
00:52:10,375 --> 00:52:12,833
This is world-ending stuff.

1040
00:52:12,916 --> 00:52:16,125
This is definitely a wish to be unwished.

1041
00:52:16,791 --> 00:52:17,875
Good luck.

1042
00:52:17,958 --> 00:52:19,833
-[gasps]
-Uh-oh!

1043
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:22,666
What we need to know
is how to unwish the wish!

1044
00:52:22,750 --> 00:52:24,166
Welcome to the magical--

1045
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,541
Whoa, it's you. Okay. [laughs]

1046
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:30,166
See, we always build in a certain amount
of time to reverse the wish.

1047
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,875
You know, in case you change your mind.

1048
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:34,250
Thank goodness you are not
all villain yet.

1049
00:52:34,333 --> 00:52:36,500
-Good.
-[stammers] Watch the tassels, please.

1050
00:52:36,583 --> 00:52:39,208
So, how far along are we? Let's see.

1051
00:52:39,291 --> 00:52:40,791
Stepmothers. Well, they're wicked.

1052
00:52:40,875 --> 00:52:42,875
Wicked good. [gasps] Mmm.

1053
00:52:42,958 --> 00:52:45,041
Check on that one. [laughs]

1054
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:46,875
The other three are, well, vain…

1055
00:52:46,958 --> 00:52:50,041
I'm not vain.
I just look good in everything. [gasps]

1056
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,458
There it is. Okay.

1057
00:52:51,541 --> 00:52:54,250
-Uh-oh.
-Cruel and ambitious.

1058
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:58,291
[laughs] Yes, I would say your clock
has not run out yet.

1059
00:52:58,375 --> 00:53:00,041
-[Giselle] Good.
-What kinda clock do you mean?

1060
00:53:00,125 --> 00:53:01,583
-It could be anything.
-[Giselle sighs]

1061
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:04,458
Have you seen
a flower dropping petals? Huh?

1062
00:53:04,541 --> 00:53:05,625
-No?
-Mm-mmm.

1063
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:08,708
How about a clock
counting down to midnight

1064
00:53:08,791 --> 00:53:10,875
-with an ominous-sounding chime?
-[gasps]

1065
00:53:10,958 --> 00:53:14,208
I mean, it's pretty on the nose,
but it's a classic!

1066
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:17,000
You know, that's not a litter box.
That's where I live.

1067
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:18,541
-[meows]
-Not to worry, though.

1068
00:53:18,625 --> 00:53:20,958
-As long as you unwish it before midnight…
-[gasps]

1069
00:53:21,041 --> 00:53:22,333
…you'll be fine.

1070
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:23,541
What happens at midnight?

1071
00:53:23,625 --> 00:53:27,166
On the last stroke of 12:00,
the spell is set,

1072
00:53:27,250 --> 00:53:29,833
and nothing will be as it was before.

1073
00:53:29,916 --> 00:53:32,875
It means your wish is permanent.

1074
00:53:32,958 --> 00:53:36,916
For all time, 'ime, 'ime, 'ime!

1075
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:39,166
[chuckles] I did that for effect.

1076
00:53:40,083 --> 00:53:41,208
Permanent.

1077
00:53:41,291 --> 00:53:46,833
To unwish your wish, all you have to do
is use the wand, labeled "wand."

1078
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:49,416
-[Pip] Where is it?
-Yes, yes, yes. It's right--

1079
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:52,208
Uh… [gasps]

1080
00:53:52,291 --> 00:53:53,916
-It's gone.
-[bell tolls]

1081
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,000
[gasps] Oh, no.

1082
00:53:55,083 --> 00:53:57,708
[laughs] Well, good luck with all of this.
You need it.

1083
00:53:58,791 --> 00:53:59,875
[Giselle] Oh. [sighs]

1084
00:53:59,958 --> 00:54:03,125
-Hurry! It's already--
-Two o'clock.

1085
00:54:03,208 --> 00:54:05,916
-[bell tolls]
-That means it's cruelty.

1086
00:54:06,750 --> 00:54:08,458
[chuckles] No, no, no, no.

1087
00:54:08,541 --> 00:54:10,625
We can't let this happen.
We have to fight it.

1088
00:54:10,708 --> 00:54:13,500
I'm not an evil cat. I'm not an evil cat.
I'm not an evil cat.

1089
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:16,041
You stay here.
I have to find a way to stop this.

1090
00:54:16,125 --> 00:54:18,625
[groans] And I have to lick this,
for some reason.

1091
00:54:18,708 --> 00:54:19,541
Hmm.

1092
00:54:19,625 --> 00:54:22,625
Ugh. Aw, yeah, that's real bad. [groans]

1093
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:27,208
It's all going to be okay.
We just need some magic.

1094
00:54:27,291 --> 00:54:29,916
As we say in Andalasia,
"Magic fixes everything."

1095
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,000
Or breaks it?

1096
00:54:31,083 --> 00:54:32,958
But then you find more magic
to undo the magic,

1097
00:54:33,041 --> 00:54:34,833
-and then everything's fine again.
-Good day, madam.

1098
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:37,125
[gasps] Oh. Well, at least we look fine.

1099
00:54:37,208 --> 00:54:39,666
[gasps] That is not important right now.

1100
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:40,958
Speak for yourself.

1101
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:43,750
But Robert will certainly appreciate it.

1102
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:45,875
If he isn't slain by something. [giggles]

1103
00:54:45,958 --> 00:54:49,541
[gasps] Oh, no! She's right.
I mean, I'm right.

He thinks he's a prince. With a sword.
Who knows what he'll find out there?

1105
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:55,958
Or Morgan.

1106
00:54:57,083 --> 00:54:59,708
Although, nothing ever happens
to young girls in Andalasia.

1107
00:54:59,791 --> 00:55:02,250
They just sing and pick flowers

1108
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:07,208
and sometimes get trapped in a tower
or a dungeon or get kidnapped by trolls.

1109
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:08,916

00:59:55,583 --> 00:59:57,166
Uh… [laughs]

1194
00:59:57,250 --> 01:00:00,625
Are there imperfect partners? [chuckles]

1195
01:00:00,708 --> 01:00:05,166
Oh, yes. Stick with me.
Your toes will be very happy you did.

1196
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:08,041
[chuckles] Well, then on their behalf,
I thank you.

1197
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:11,041
And I accept.

1198
01:00:11,125 --> 01:00:12,333
Then I am honored.

1199
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,375
[chuckles]

1200
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:21,666
Hmm.

1201
01:00:23,708 --> 01:00:26,625
[Rosaleen] I'll give it to her!
She likes me when I give her things.

1202
01:00:26,708 --> 01:00:30,125
-[Ruby] But I'm the one who got it!
-I'm the one that pulled you out.

1203
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:35,958
Any wand of Giselle's
can't possibly be that powerful.

1204
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:41,125
But, I suppose I should see
what I can do with it.

1205
01:00:41,208 --> 01:00:42,916
-Oh. [chuckles]
-Mm-hmm.

1206
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:45,750
Let's see. I wish…

1207
01:00:45,833 --> 01:00:46,666
-Mm-hmm?
-[gasps]

1208
01:00:47,416 --> 01:00:49,083
-…Ruby…
-Oh.

1209
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:50,000
[giggles]

1210
01:00:50,083 --> 01:00:51,125
…was a toad.

1211
01:00:51,208 --> 01:00:53,208
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1212
01:00:53,291 --> 01:00:55,333
[all scream]

1213
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,083
[gasps]

1214
01:00:57,166 --> 01:00:58,666
[groans]

1215
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:02,041
Oh, I'm a talking toad. I knew, I--

1216
01:01:02,125 --> 01:01:03,375
-[grunts]
-Oh! Oh.

1217
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:05,083
-[gasps] Phew.
-Stupid chair!

1218
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:06,958
[huffs]

1219
01:01:07,541 --> 01:01:11,458
Mirror! What kind of magic is this?

1220
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,083
[chuckles]
Ask any question and I shall appear.

1221
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:18,500
Well, that's an easy one.
It's Andalasian magic,

1222
01:01:18,583 --> 01:01:22,291
which means only a true son
or daughter of Andalasia can, um…

1223
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:23,916
[chuckles] …use it.

1224
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,291
-Aah.
-Mmm. [chuckles]

1225
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:27,541
Hello. Who are you?

1226
01:01:27,625 --> 01:01:28,875
Grab him.

1227
01:01:29,458 --> 01:01:31,166
-[Ruby squeals] Gotcha!
-[Scroll groans]

1228
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,541
Oh! Stop! Stop!

1229
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:34,000
-He's a slippery little devil.
-[laughs]

1230
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:36,416
-I'm ticklish over there. My tassels!
-Oh, so cute!

1231
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,000
Careful of the fine print.

1232
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:42,083
I'm sorry.
Did you say, "Ask any question"?

1233
01:01:42,166 --> 01:01:45,291
[chuckles] Oh, no. Away. Poof! Away.
Come-- Poof!

1234
01:01:45,375 --> 01:01:48,625
No, no, you're not going anywhere.

1235
01:01:48,708 --> 01:01:50,958
I've got quite a number of questions.

1236
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:54,583
-Lots and lots and lots of questions.
-Mm-hmm.

1237
01:01:54,666 --> 01:01:57,541
So you're going to start
from the beginning…

1238
01:01:57,625 --> 01:01:58,625
[Scroll] Don't ask me.

1239
01:01:58,708 --> 01:02:02,208
…or I might have to do a little editing.

1240
01:02:02,291 --> 01:02:03,291
[scissors snip]

1241
01:02:11,208 --> 01:02:15,041
[humming]

1242
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:20,750
That's quite the bouquet.

1243
01:02:20,833 --> 01:02:22,916
[chuckles]
They're gonna match my dress perfectly,

1244
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:25,250
and they were growing wild
just by the market.

1245
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:26,625
Aren't they beautiful?

1246
01:02:26,708 --> 01:02:28,708
The world is truly a miracle.

1247
01:02:29,333 --> 01:02:33,500
Oh, the most wonderful thing happened.
Tyson asked me to the festival.

1248
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,666
Hmm. Thrilling.

1249
01:02:36,916 --> 01:02:40,166
But I'm afraid you won't be attending
the festival tonight after all.

1250
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:41,958
You have far too many chores to do.

1251
01:02:43,416 --> 01:02:44,833
But I've done all my chores.

1252
01:02:44,916 --> 01:02:47,833
What about the carpets in the hall?
Awfully dusty.

1253
01:02:48,333 --> 01:02:50,458
And the windows? I can't see a thing.

1254
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:53,750
And then there's the gardening
and the sewing and the mending.

1255
01:02:53,833 --> 01:02:56,625
And don't forget about the chimneys.
Filthy business.

1256
01:02:58,083 --> 01:03:01,541
Yes, perhaps there are a few
that I've missed.

1257
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:05,000
-Oh, but surely they can wait--
-Are you speaking back to me?

1258
01:03:05,083 --> 01:03:07,958
No, of course not.
I would never do such a thing.

1259
01:03:08,041 --> 01:03:10,750
Perhaps you need
to remember your place here.

1260
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:14,500
Until you do, you are not to leave
this room, except for chores.

1261
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:16,875
And then only when I say.

1262
01:03:16,958 --> 01:03:19,583
But I promised Tyson
that I would be there.

1263
01:03:19,666 --> 01:03:21,166
Oh, come now, Morgan.

1264
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:25,083
A boy like Tyson has plenty of options
and, frankly, better ones.

1265
01:03:25,166 --> 01:03:26,875
But not to worry.

1266
01:03:27,541 --> 01:03:31,541
You can enjoy your evening
from up here in your little perch.

1267
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,416
I'm sure it will be just as magical.

1268
01:03:34,500 --> 01:03:35,541
[gasps]

1269
01:03:35,625 --> 01:03:37,750
That is sarcasm, isn't it?

1270
01:03:37,833 --> 01:03:39,125
Huh.

1271
01:03:39,208 --> 01:03:41,416
Not so hard to understand after all.

1272
01:03:42,041 --> 01:03:43,291
-Stepmother.
-Hmm?

1273
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:47,250
Stepmother, please.
You can't-- You can't be this cruel.

1274
01:03:48,708 --> 01:03:53,000
Oh, I can't help it, dear.
It's just who I am.

1275
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:56,750
No. No! [gasps]

1276
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,000
No, you have to let me out!
You can't be this cruel.

1277
01:04:00,083 --> 01:04:02,500
-Please! Please, you can't do this.
-[pounding]

1278
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Stepmother!

1279
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:11,125
[vendor] Apples! Juicy apples!

1280
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:13,333
-[rumbling]
-Ooh.

1281
01:04:15,625 --> 01:04:17,125
[rumbling]

1282
01:04:17,208 --> 01:04:19,875
Giant!

1283
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:21,583
Giant!

1284
01:04:21,666 --> 01:04:22,916
A giant is coming?

1285
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,375
A giant, it's coming!

1286
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:26,875
-[Robert cheers]
-[villagers clamoring, screaming]

1287
01:04:31,625 --> 01:04:32,625
Best take cover.

1288
01:04:32,708 --> 01:04:34,708
-[grunts, laughs]
-[rumbling continues]

1289
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:38,958

-[clamoring continues]
-[grunts]

1291
01:04:40,500 --> 01:04:41,500
Ah!

1292
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:44,625
Rope! Ha! Yes!

1293
01:04:44,708 --> 01:04:45,916
What are you doing?

1294
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:49,583
I'm gonna take this rope
and trip the giant.

1295
01:04:49,666 --> 01:04:52,916
And then he or she will be mine!

1296
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,958
[giant growls]

1297
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:00,208

[groans, grunts]

1301
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,333
Oh, no!

1302
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:12,750
[grunting]

1303
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:19,500
Oh! [chuckles]

1304
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:21,250
Oh, hey. It's all right.

1305
01:05:28,041 --> 01:05:30,750
No! [screaming]

1306
01:05:30,833 --> 01:05:33,833
-[groaning]
-Help me! I'm stuck!

1307
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:35,333
-Oh!
-Help!

1308
01:05:35,416 --> 01:05:37,000
-Oh, no.
-Please! Help!

1309
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:39,500
-I'm coming!
-[child screaming]

1310

[screams]

1311
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:44,750
[pants] It's okay. It's okay.

1312
01:05:45,333 --> 01:05:46,500
It's all done now.

1313
01:05:46,583 --> 01:05:49,416
The big bad giant is gone. [sighs]

1314
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,166
Bella!

1315
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,583
-Mommy!
-Oh.

1316
01:05:53,791 --> 01:05:54,875
Mom.

1317
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:57,625
I'm sorry! [pants]

1318
01:05:57,708 --> 01:05:59,541
I turned away for one second!

1319
01:05:59,625 --> 01:06:02,500
-We are in your debt, sir.
-A true hero.

1320
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,083
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1321
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:08,125
Thanks to you, our family is safe.
I'm forever grateful.

1322
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:13,833
Hmm.

1323
01:06:15,916 --> 01:06:16,916
[sighs]

01:06:17,958 --> 01:06:19,041
[dragon fruit snarls]

1325
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,833
Oh.

1326
01:06:34,125 --> 01:06:35,125
[exhales]

1327
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:36,750
Uh…

1328
01:06:37,833 --> 01:06:38,833
[whispers] Okay.

1329
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:49,875
[grunts]

1330
01:06:52,625 --> 01:06:53,833
Going somewhere?

1331
01:06:53,916 --> 01:06:54,916
[gasps]

1332
01:06:55,416 --> 01:06:57,916
[stammers] No, it's--
It's not what you think.

1333
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,000
-I--
-[Giselle] Hmm.

1334
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:01,041
I just have to tell him
why I won't be there.

1335
01:07:01,125 --> 01:07:03,625
Stepmother, please.
I'll be home in no time at all.

1336
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,833
Oh, you're right. You will be.

1337
01:07:05,916 --> 01:07:07,833
Because you're not going anywhere.

1338
01:07:07,916 --> 01:07:10,708
[gasps] Please! Please don't do this!

1339
01:07:10,791 --> 01:07:11,791
-Please--
-[gasps]

1340
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,583
-[lightly] Morgan?
-Stepmother?

1341
01:07:17,041 --> 01:07:18,125
[in deep voice] Morgan.

1342
01:07:18,208 --> 01:07:19,500
Are you okay?

1343
01:07:19,583 --> 01:07:22,041
Never better!
Now we're going back up to your tower.

1344
01:07:22,125 --> 01:07:23,333
[bell tolls]

1345
01:07:23,958 --> 01:07:26,583
Oh, no. It can't be. Not yet.

1346
01:07:26,666 --> 01:07:28,250
What are you talking about?

1347
01:07:28,333 --> 01:07:29,875
Ambition. [gasps]

1348
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:33,000
It's the last one, and then I'm fully her.

1349
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:34,208
What is going on?

1350
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:36,500
[bell tolls]

1351
01:07:36,583 --> 01:07:38,500
-Oh, Morgan. I'm so sorry.
-What is--

1352
01:07:38,583 --> 01:07:40,375
It's all my fault. [gasps]

1353
01:07:41,208 --> 01:07:44,041
I wished for a fairy-tale life,
and it's all gone terribly wrong.

1354
01:07:44,125 --> 01:07:45,958
-[bell tolls]
-[deep voice] Or terribly right.

1355
01:07:46,041 --> 01:07:47,333
[stammers] No. Wait!

1356
01:07:47,416 --> 01:07:50,208
Poor sweet Giselle doesn't know
what she wants, but I do.

1357
01:07:50,291 --> 01:07:53,291
-Stepmother, please just--
-Morgan, you have to listen to me.

1358
01:07:53,375 --> 01:07:55,166
[gasps] Oh, yes, yes.

1359
01:07:55,250 --> 01:07:57,833
Perfect little Morgan,
not so perfect now, is she?

1360
01:07:57,916 --> 01:07:59,041
[gasps]

1361
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:00,875
Don't you dare!

1362
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:04,625
Oh, I'll dare all I like.

1363
01:08:04,708 --> 01:08:07,208
Stop it! You're-- You're scaring me.

1364
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:08,291
I know.

1365
01:08:08,375 --> 01:08:10,458
[pants] I wish I could do it myself,

1366
01:08:10,541 --> 01:08:14,041
but who knows what would happen
if I went over there like this? [gasps]

1367
01:08:14,958 --> 01:08:15,958
You have to go.

1368
01:08:16,541 --> 01:08:17,375
[gasps]

1369
01:08:17,458 --> 01:08:19,250
[chuckles] Yes!

1370
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:21,583
Get help before it's too late.

1371
01:08:21,666 --> 01:08:23,166
[panting]

1372
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:26,916
-And you have to do it before midnight.
-Do what? [pants]

1373
01:08:27,625 --> 01:08:28,958
Save us.

1374
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:33,500
[screams]

1375
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:35,708
Oh. [gasps]

1376
01:08:38,583 --> 01:08:40,416
Wretched girl! [chuckles]

1377
01:08:40,500 --> 01:08:42,208
-[Sofia crying]
-[gasps]

1378
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:43,916
[crying continues]

1379
01:08:44,875 --> 01:08:46,750
-You three!
-[all gasp]

1380
01:08:46,833 --> 01:08:48,791
[Giselle]
You look like you're good with children.

1381
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,583
My precious darling needs tending to.
See to it.

1382
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:54,666
[all whimpering]

1383
01:08:56,583 --> 01:09:00,958
Mmm.
Oh, I feel superior to all living things.

1384
01:09:01,041 --> 01:09:03,250
I don't know why we were fighting this.

1385
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:04,333
[Giselle] Indeed!

1386
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:09,583
Who knew that being a villain
could feel so… liberating?

1387
01:09:10,375 --> 01:09:12,708
-Now, I just need to find that wand.
-[grunts, hisses]

1388
01:09:12,791 --> 01:09:13,833
[mug shatters]

1389
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:14,916
[chuckles]

1390
01:09:21,375 --> 01:09:23,875
What have we here?

1391
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:39,458
You know, stepmothers are many things.

1392
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:42,083
But one of the things we are not
is powerful.

1393
01:09:42,166 --> 01:09:45,333
That's why we have to go through
all of these ridiculous manipulations.

1394
01:09:45,416 --> 01:09:47,291
We have no power of our own.

1395
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:52,125
Now that Morgan's gone,
I'm not a stepmother anymore.

1396
01:09:52,208 --> 01:09:53,041
[Pip yawns]

1397
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:56,208
So I think it's time
I took on a new role in this town.

1398
01:09:57,625 --> 01:09:59,458
I'd like to be queen!

1399
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:01,916
Yeah, but there's already a queen,

1400
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,791
and I feel like
she is really attached to the job.

1401
01:10:04,875 --> 01:10:07,541
[chuckles]
That should be easy enough to fix.

1402
01:10:07,625 --> 01:10:13,250
A villain like Malvina can't resist
a chance to show the world how bad she is.

1403
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:15,291
Mmm. So, where are we going?

1404
01:10:15,375 --> 01:10:16,625
I say we give it to her.

1405
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:21,375
And then I have a little job for you,
my pet.

1406
01:10:21,458 --> 01:10:25,458
Ooh. Do I get to be evil now?

1407
01:10:25,541 --> 01:10:26,708
-Oh, yes.
-[purring]

1408
01:10:34,041 --> 01:10:35,125
Oh.

1409
01:10:35,208 --> 01:10:36,583
Uh-uh. Oh.

1410
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:40,916
[bell tinkles]

1411
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:44,375
[Giselle chuckles]

1412
01:10:44,458 --> 01:10:47,375
-Hmm?
-[gasps] Mirror, mirror in her hand.

1413
01:10:47,458 --> 01:10:50,208
Who is the most blatantly insecure woman,

1414
01:10:50,291 --> 01:10:53,250
whose constant need
to ask her own reflection for validation

1415
01:10:53,333 --> 01:10:56,458
suggests that what she really needs to do
is to love herself,

1416
01:10:57,458 --> 01:10:58,833
in all the land?

1417
01:10:58,916 --> 01:10:59,916
[chuckles]

1418
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,833
Giselle, a pleasure as always.

1419
01:11:04,458 --> 01:11:07,333
Yes, I imagine it is. [gasps]

1420
01:11:07,416 --> 01:11:12,041
Well, I was hoping that I'd run into you,
and look at this. It seems I have.

1421
01:11:12,125 --> 01:11:13,791
[chuckles]

1422
01:11:13,875 --> 01:11:16,291
So, what can I do for you then?

1423
01:11:17,041 --> 01:11:19,250
I thought it only fair
to give you a chance

1424
01:11:19,333 --> 01:11:24,166
to hand Monrolasia over to me peacefully
before any unpleasantness begins.

1425
01:11:24,666 --> 01:11:25,750
-[gasps]
-Mmm?

1426
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:28,875
[laughs]

1427
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:31,000
And why would I do that?

1428
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:34,208
Because this town is mine.

1429
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:36,916
I think we both know that, don't we?

1430
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:38,458
Oh… [gasps]

1431
01:11:40,041 --> 01:11:41,625
-[grunts]
-Oh.

1432
01:11:42,916 --> 01:11:47,958
Sadly, I'm going to have to decline
your generous offer.

1433
01:11:48,041 --> 01:11:51,791
Having had a chat
with your little scroll friend,

1434
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:55,666
it's clear that Monrolasia is everything
it was meant to be,

1435
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:59,125
however that might have occurred.

1436
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:02,583
Hmm.

1437
01:12:02,666 --> 01:12:04,958
Well, I tried.

1438
01:12:05,041 --> 01:12:08,375
But if you won't accept the offer,

1439
01:12:09,208 --> 01:12:11,791
you know there's only one thing
that can happen.

1440
01:12:11,875 --> 01:12:13,000
[Malvina] Indeed.

1441
01:12:14,208 --> 01:12:15,208
Dance-off!

1442
01:12:15,291 --> 01:12:16,958
You see what I gotta put up with?

1443
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,291
One of us has to die.

1444
01:12:19,958 --> 01:12:23,041
Mmm. Say, midnight?

1445
01:12:23,125 --> 01:12:24,333
Sounds about right.

1446
01:12:24,833 --> 01:12:27,708
Again,
I'm so sorry to ruin your little party

1447
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:30,583
with all of this messy
"destroying you" business.

1448
01:12:30,666 --> 01:12:32,625
Oh, Giselle.

1449
01:12:33,666 --> 01:12:35,083
You're hilarious.

01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:36,458

01:12:36,541 --> 01:12:39,750

The well!

1516
01:16:29,166 --> 01:16:31,750
Oh, no, no, no.

1517
01:16:32,541 --> 01:16:37,125
Why am I so pointy?
And my eyebrows are so perfect.

1518
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:40,416
What the heck am I wearing?

1519
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,166
Is this Andalasia?

1520
01:16:44,666 --> 01:16:47,625
Wow. This is not what I pictured at all.

1521
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:49,416
-Morgan?
-Nancy.

1522
01:16:49,500 --> 01:16:51,083
What are you doing here?

1523
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:52,750
I'm not sure.

1524
01:16:52,833 --> 01:16:54,875
Something weird happened.

1525
01:16:54,958 --> 01:16:58,666
Did it, by any chance,
include a giant hole in your sky?

1526
01:16:58,750 --> 01:17:01,125
[Morgan] A what? What the heck is that?

1527
01:17:01,625 --> 01:17:04,541
Last night,
that mysterious hole appeared in the sky

1528
01:17:04,625 --> 01:17:08,750
and started pulling all of our magic
into some other place.

1529
01:17:08,833 --> 01:17:09,958
[troll] Oh.

1530
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:13,000
Okay, Morgan, tell us what happened.

1531
01:17:13,083 --> 01:17:18,000
Well, Giselle and I had
a pretty bad fight. And then, uh…

1532
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:19,208
[Nancy] And then what?

1533
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:21,833
-[gasps]
-[Morgan] I'm not sure, exactly.

1534
01:17:21,916 --> 01:17:25,875
But the last thing I remember is
Giselle acting really, really cruel.

1535
01:17:25,958 --> 01:17:29,833
And then she said something about
making a wish and that I had to fix it.

1536
01:17:29,916 --> 01:17:33,583
Oh, Edward. The wishing wand.
She must have used it.

1537
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:37,125
But what could she have possibly
wished for that would have done all this?

1538
01:17:37,208 --> 01:17:42,333
Well, whatever it was, it turned our whole
town into some kind of fairy-tale place.

1539
01:17:42,416 --> 01:17:44,000
Just like Andalasia.

1540
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:47,458
Morgan, a wish so big
that it changes a world

1541
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:49,375
wouldn't need a little of our magic.

1542
01:17:49,875 --> 01:17:53,250
Why, it would-- It would need all of it,
every last bit.

1543
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:56,541
Wait.
But everything here is made of magic.

1544
01:17:56,625 --> 01:18:00,125
If it's all gone,
then what happens to Andalasia?

1545
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:01,833
If we can't reverse this,

1546
01:18:01,916 --> 01:18:04,666
everything Andalasian
will be gone forever.

1547
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:08,541
I don't want Andalasia
to disappear forever.

1548
01:18:08,625 --> 01:18:10,291
-I know. I know.
-No.

1549
01:18:10,375 --> 01:18:11,875
There must be something we can do.

1550
01:18:11,958 --> 01:18:17,250
Giselle just needs to remember who she is,
and then she can fix all of this.

1551
01:18:17,333 --> 01:18:18,416
I know she can.

1552
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,916
Remember? Edward!

1553
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:22,166
Of course.

1554
01:18:22,250 --> 01:18:24,375
The magic of memories.

1555
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:26,333
What? You mean Giselle's memory tree?

1556
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:28,333
It's real?

1557
01:18:28,416 --> 01:18:32,083
It is.
And it's the strongest magic there is.

1558
01:18:34,416 --> 01:18:35,416
[door closes]

1559
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:36,875

-[Sofia babbles]
-[chattering continues]

1562
01:18:40,416 --> 01:18:41,416
Hello.

1563
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:43,791
Who are you?

1564
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:45,833
[fairy] We're your garden fairies.

1565
01:18:45,916 --> 01:18:49,208
-I'd turn around if I were you.
-Unless you wanna get thrown off the roof.

1566
01:18:50,916 --> 01:18:51,916
Hmm.

1567
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:53,875
[babbles]

1568
01:18:54,416 --> 01:18:56,791
[sighs] Ah!

1569
01:18:56,875 --> 01:19:00,333
Seems like the babysitters
have had quite the day.

1570
01:19:00,416 --> 01:19:03,666
So have I, dear.

1571
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:06,958
Hmm.

1572
01:19:07,750 --> 01:19:08,750
Hmm.

1573
01:19:12,541 --> 01:19:16,000
We're really going to need
something more regal than this.

1574
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:17,666
And minions.

1575
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:20,791
We'll definitely need minions
if we want anything done right.

1576
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:23,875
Where did you say Morgan was again?

1577
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:25,333
Oh. [chuckles]

1578
01:19:25,416 --> 01:19:26,500
Who knows?

1579
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:28,916
-Hmm.
-Probably singing to a mouse or something.

1580
01:19:29,708 --> 01:19:31,833
But who cares? Tonight's about me.

1581
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,750
Stop the carriage.

1582
01:19:35,833 --> 01:19:36,833
Whoa!

1583
01:19:36,916 --> 01:19:37,791
[Giselle] Robert.

1584
01:19:38,458 --> 01:19:40,500
Morgan wouldn't just disappear like this.

1585
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:42,750
Unless something's happened.

1586
01:19:43,375 --> 01:19:45,791
Something's wrong.
I'm going to go find her.

1587
01:19:45,875 --> 01:19:48,000
Oh, well, another fruitless quest,

1588
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:50,458

01:20:05,875 --> 01:20:10,375
Okay, I knew it was a tree house,
but that's a "tree house."

1593
01:20:10,458 --> 01:20:12,500
-We do whimsy really well.
-Huh.

1594
01:20:12,583 --> 01:20:14,125
I think the tree is over here.

1595
01:20:14,916 --> 01:20:16,041
[bird squawks]

1596
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:21,250
That's it. That's the tree!

01:20:27,666 --> 01:20:28,666
[sighs]

1598
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:33,666
Oh, no.

1599
01:20:40,541 --> 01:20:41,583
It's dead.

1600
01:20:43,208 --> 01:20:46,416
Never fear. We will come up with something
very smart at the very last minute

1601
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,958
that solves all our problems.

1602
01:20:48,041 --> 01:20:49,083
Edward.

1603
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:51,333
What? That's how it works here.

1604
01:20:51,416 --> 01:20:53,333
There has to be something we can do.

1605
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:58,791
You know, for a little girl with no mom,

1606
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:01,666
seeing a princess hanging from a billboard
was magic.

1607
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:04,583
I-I knew it was real.
I didn't even have to think about it.

1608
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:06,583
Things were so much easier back then.

1609
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:08,625
-[Giselle's voice] I'll never forget you.
-Whoa.

1610
01:21:08,708 --> 01:21:09,791
What was that?

1611
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:11,791
You brought the flower back to life.

1612
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:12,916
I did?

1613
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:15,125
But how? I'm not magic.

1614
01:21:15,208 --> 01:21:16,708
No, but these memories are.

1615
01:21:17,208 --> 01:21:19,041
And they live inside you as well.

1616
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:20,708
Which means their magic does too.

1617
01:21:20,791 --> 01:21:22,500
Morgan, you're the key.

1618
01:21:22,583 --> 01:21:25,166
That's what Giselle meant
by telling you to save us.

1619
01:21:25,250 --> 01:21:28,166
So, maybe if I can bring
some of this tree back,

1620
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:31,875
the magic in it will get her to remember
that who she really is, is good.

1621
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:33,583
Then she'll fix this.

1622
01:21:34,458 --> 01:21:36,166
I think we're running out of time.

1623
01:21:37,208 --> 01:21:38,750

1624
01:21:38,833 --> 01:21:40,458
[Nancy] Morgan, it will.

1625
01:21:40,541 --> 01:21:43,750
You just have to remember
all the good in these moments

01:27:13,416 --> 01:27:16,458
Okay. Ladies, have you learned nothing?
Gotta be quicker than that.

1702
01:27:16,541 --> 01:27:18,250
-How is he so fast?
-[gasps] Oh.

1703
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:19,541
Oh.

1704
01:27:19,625 --> 01:27:22,125
-We can get him down.
-Oh, hey, wait. Come on!

1705
01:27:23,125 --> 01:27:24,666
And away we go!

1706
01:27:24,750 --> 01:27:25,583
[both groan]

1707
01:27:25,666 --> 01:27:29,333
Hey, you ladies have been great,
but I got a ball to catch. See you later.

1708
01:27:31,625 --> 01:27:34,500
[chattering, laughing]

1709
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,125
Do I look ready?

1710
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:44,041
There you are, my pet. Any problems?

1711
01:27:44,791 --> 01:27:46,541
Nope. Turns out I'm good at evil.

1712
01:27:48,708 --> 01:27:53,166
Well, now comes the fun part.

1713
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:56,625
I'm ready now.

1714
01:27:58,666 --> 01:28:00,125
Hope I'm not underdressed.

1715
01:28:00,791 --> 01:28:02,875
Oh, wait a second. What is this?

1716
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:06,708
Ooh. Ooh, yeah.

1717
01:28:08,333 --> 01:28:11,250
Uh. Uh, hey! Wait a minute. I'm with her.

1718
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,250
Folks, this is my stop.

1719
01:28:13,333 --> 01:28:14,750
Hello? Mr. Wig.

1720
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,208
Forgot abou-- I'm with her.
I gotta get out of here. Hey!

1721
01:28:19,291 --> 01:28:22,291
Hey! Hey, what's happening? Wait a minute.

1722
01:28:22,375 --> 01:28:23,875
You forgot about me!

1723
01:28:38,791 --> 01:28:39,791
Hmm.

1724
01:28:43,541 --> 01:28:46,083
Morgan, where have you been? Are you okay?

1725
01:28:46,166 --> 01:28:47,666
No. Actually I'm really, really not.

1726
01:28:47,750 --> 01:28:49,208
-Can I get a lift?
-Of course.

1727
01:28:49,291 --> 01:28:51,208
Go! I'll be right behind you.

1728
01:28:51,291 --> 01:28:52,375
[whinnies]

1729
01:28:58,291 --> 01:28:59,541
Now, let's see.

1730
01:29:01,250 --> 01:29:04,875
I wish to be Queen of Monrolasia.

1731
01:29:06,583 --> 01:29:07,583
[exhales]

1732
01:29:08,333 --> 01:29:09,333
Ah.

1733
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:11,541
[villager] Make way! Make way!

1734
01:29:13,166 --> 01:29:14,333
We have to get inside.

1735
01:29:22,375 --> 01:29:23,791
[applause]

1736
01:29:25,166 --> 01:29:27,750
I believe you are in my seat.

1737
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:28,875
[all gasp]

1738
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:33,875
You again.

1739
01:29:33,958 --> 01:29:35,416
[murmuring]

1740
01:29:37,166 --> 01:29:42,458
And I believe it's time we end this
once and for all.

1741
01:29:42,958 --> 01:29:45,958
Oh, yes. Please.

1742
01:29:57,750 --> 01:29:59,416
[screaming, clamoring]

1743
01:30:01,041 --> 01:30:02,666
[groaning]

1744
01:30:02,750 --> 01:30:04,708
[Malvina] Stupid chair!

1745
01:30:04,791 --> 01:30:07,875
[groans] Why does this keep happening?

1746
01:30:07,958 --> 01:30:09,625
-[rumbling]
-[gasps]

1747
01:30:09,708 --> 01:30:11,708
[clamoring]

1748
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:15,875
Is this my mother's doing?

1749
01:30:15,958 --> 01:30:17,375
-[both grunt]
-[Morgan screams]

1750
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:20,041
No, it's Andalasia.

1751
01:30:20,125 --> 01:30:21,500
It's breaking through.

1752
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,041
[screaming]

1753
01:30:23,625 --> 01:30:26,500
Okay. Deep breath. Suck in. [grunts]

1754
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:28,583
[screaming, clamoring]

1755
01:30:43,333 --> 01:30:44,458
I wish.

1756
01:30:44,541 --> 01:30:45,666
[gasps]

1757
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:47,375

[cackles] Guards.

1763
01:31:07,666 --> 01:31:09,291
Destroy her.

1764
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:12,208
I wish.

1765
01:31:14,541 --> 01:31:16,583
[clamoring]

1766
01:31:18,500 --> 01:31:20,625
[laughs, gasps] Mmm.

1767
01:31:20,708 --> 01:31:23,833
They're just butterflies! Idiots!

1768
01:31:26,583 --> 01:31:28,583
[clamoring]

1769
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:35,000
-Your Majesty! Your Majesty!
-Oh. [panting]

1770
01:31:35,083 --> 01:31:36,666
Ruby wants to tell you something
about the wand.

1771
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:39,458
-[Ruby stammers]
-Oh, does she?

1772
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:42,208
-[gasps]
-Hi!

1773
01:31:43,083 --> 01:31:45,833
It was her fault.
She's the one that should be the toad.

1774
01:31:45,916 --> 01:31:47,625
And you're the one who let the cat in.

1775
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:49,958
You two are the worst!

1776
01:31:50,041 --> 01:31:53,208
-Huh?
-[both shouting]

1777
01:31:56,916 --> 01:31:59,291
-[Malvina] Hmm. [chuckling]
-[ribbiting]

1778
01:31:59,375 --> 01:32:00,958
Speaking of toads.

1779
01:32:01,041 --> 01:32:02,750
I wish.

1780
01:32:04,958 --> 01:32:06,416

-Nancy!
-Robert!

1785
01:32:22,250 --> 01:32:23,458
Have you seen Morgan?

1786
01:32:23,541 --> 01:32:26,208
-Yes. She's here. She's fine.
-Oh, thank goodness.

1787
01:32:26,291 --> 01:32:28,041
My God, people are going crazy.

1788
01:32:28,125 --> 01:32:30,875
I know. I know. Listen, it's Giselle.
She's under a curse.

1789
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,375
We have to save her so she can stop this.

1790
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:34,333
A curse?

1791
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:36,375
Let's go!

1792
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:39,750
[screams]

1793
01:32:39,833 --> 01:32:41,125
[grunts]

1794
01:32:41,916 --> 01:32:42,916
[Robert] Morgan!

1795
01:32:43,916 --> 01:32:45,041
[Morgan] Dad!

1796
01:32:45,625 --> 01:32:46,625
Dad!

1797
01:32:46,708 --> 01:32:48,166
How have you fared? Oh!

1798
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:50,166
I have searched both hither and yon.

1799
01:32:50,250 --> 01:32:51,833
We need to get inside. Let's go.

1800
01:32:51,916 --> 01:32:53,541
When did my daughter become so brave?

1801
01:32:54,333 --> 01:32:55,416
Now we save Giselle.

1802
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,958
Time to be heroes.

1803
01:32:57,041 --> 01:32:58,750
[grunts]

1804
01:32:58,833 --> 01:33:00,250

-Need a hand?

1810
01:33:21,625 --> 01:33:23,500
-[Tyson] Mother, stop this!
-[Robert] Giselle!

-Hmm.
-[gasps]

1814
01:33:40,666 --> 01:33:42,708
Useless garbage.

1815
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:44,166
No!

1816
01:33:45,166 --> 01:33:46,166
Giselle, no!

1817
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:54,791
[Giselle's voice]
This is a very nice place.

1818
01:33:54,875 --> 01:33:56,958
-[Robert's voice] Yeah.
-[Giselle's voice] This is a date.

1819
01:33:57,041 --> 01:33:59,708
-She's very kind and very sweet.
-[Robert's voice] Yeah.

1820
01:34:00,416 --> 01:34:03,041
-[young Morgan's voice] Giselle!
-[Giselle's voice] I'm right here, Morgan.

1821
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:05,708
[Morgan's voice] Hey, wait for me!

1822
01:34:07,041 --> 01:34:09,541
Mom, where are you going?

1823
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:11,500
[Giselle's voice] I'm not going anywhere.

1824
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:15,875
[Robert's voice]
You'll always be a princess to me.

1825
01:34:18,416 --> 01:34:20,041
[young Morgan's voice]
Higher! Higher, Mom!

1826
01:34:20,875 --> 01:34:22,041
[cackling]

1827
01:34:24,791 --> 01:34:26,083
[yowls]

1828
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:30,041
Uh-oh.
What the heck is going on around here?

1829
01:34:30,625 --> 01:34:31,750
Uh, Giselle!

1830
01:34:40,625 --> 01:34:41,625
[Giselle] Oh.

1831
01:34:44,416 --> 01:34:45,416
[gasps]

1832
01:34:55,708 --> 01:34:56,708
Robert.

1833
01:34:57,875 --> 01:34:58,708
[Giselle chuckles]

1834
01:34:58,791 --> 01:34:59,625
[chuckles]

1835
01:35:00,833 --> 01:35:01,916
My sweet Giselle.

1836
01:35:03,208 --> 01:35:04,583
You've come back to me.

1837
01:35:05,666 --> 01:35:09,083
I'm so sorry. I don't want minions.

1838
01:35:10,625 --> 01:35:12,125
[rumbling]

1839
01:35:12,208 --> 01:35:13,541
[gasps]

1840
01:35:13,625 --> 01:35:15,500
Nancy, where's Edward?

1841
01:35:15,583 --> 01:35:17,666
He stayed behind to protect Andalasia.

1842
01:35:17,750 --> 01:35:18,750
[Giselle] Oh, no.

1843
01:35:18,833 --> 01:35:20,666
-Please, we have to hurry.
-[gasps]

1844
01:35:22,833 --> 01:35:24,208
The magic is disappearing.

1845
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:28,500
We have to stop this
or everything Andalasian will die.

1846
01:35:30,875 --> 01:35:32,416
And that means that you…

1847
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:35,000
will?

1848
01:35:35,083 --> 01:35:36,083
No.

1849
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:38,625
No, I--

1850
01:35:39,458 --> 01:35:40,541
I can fix this.

1851
01:35:41,125 --> 01:35:42,375
[Malvina] Stop!

1852
01:35:43,250 --> 01:35:45,166
I wouldn't if I were you.

1853
01:35:47,291 --> 01:35:48,541
-[Malvina laughs]
-[Robert] Morgan.

1854
01:35:48,625 --> 01:35:50,000
Morgan! [pants]

1855
01:35:50,083 --> 01:35:52,875
-Mother, what are you doing?
-Oh, relax, darling.

1856
01:35:52,958 --> 01:35:55,041
It's just a little sleeping potion.

1857
01:35:55,125 --> 01:35:59,500
It was actually meant for Giselle,
but this'll do.

1858
01:35:59,583 --> 01:36:01,125
Malvina, you have to undo it.

1859
01:36:01,208 --> 01:36:02,333
[Malvina] Oh, and I shall.

1860
01:36:02,416 --> 01:36:06,250
Your helpful scroll explained
at the last stroke of midnight,

1861
01:36:06,333 --> 01:36:07,500
your wish is permanent.

1862
01:36:07,583 --> 01:36:09,541
And I like this world.

1863
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:12,000
So you're going to drop that wand
and let the clock strike,

1864
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,291
and then, she'll be free.

1865
01:36:14,375 --> 01:36:18,625
But if I do that, Andalasia dies.

1866
01:36:19,541 --> 01:36:22,208
And if you don't do it, she dies.

1867
01:36:23,375 --> 01:36:25,916
-No.
-Cease, evil witch.

1868
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,916
Oh, Robert. Don't you think
you're being a little harsh?

1869
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:30,208
Malvina, please.

1870
01:36:31,333 --> 01:36:32,458
This isn't you.

1871
01:36:32,541 --> 01:36:33,500
It is now.

1872
01:36:33,583 --> 01:36:38,041
Just as you wished it.

1873
01:36:38,125 --> 01:36:39,875
[gasps] No!

1874
01:36:42,333 --> 01:36:43,708
[gasps]

1875
01:36:48,333 --> 01:36:49,333
[Malvina chuckles]

1876
01:36:56,416 --> 01:36:57,625

[chuckles]
Your tiny peasants are quite fierce.

2051
01:46:28,958 --> 01:46:30,875
-As are you, Robert…
-Oh, no.

2052
01:46:30,958 --> 01:46:35,583
…who so grandly helped save the day
with my sword.

2053
01:46:35,666 --> 01:46:39,416
Well, may your adventures
with my sword continue, my good man.

2054
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:43,708
-Actually, Edward. I've hung up the sword.
-Ah.

2055
01:46:43,791 --> 01:46:46,166
I'm happy to say
I don't really need it here.

2056
01:46:46,250 --> 01:46:47,625
-Really? [chuckles]
-Yeah.

2057
01:46:47,708 --> 01:46:49,083
-Yeah.
-What a tragedy.

2058
01:46:49,166 --> 01:46:50,291
Can I have it back?

2059
01:46:50,375 --> 01:46:51,541
-Yes. Of course you can.
-[laughs]

2060
01:46:51,625 --> 01:46:53,500
-Okay. Great.
-[Giselle] Shall we feast?

2061
01:46:53,583 --> 01:46:55,041
-[Nancy] Absolutely.
-What can I get you?

2062
01:46:55,125 --> 01:46:57,833
-But first, we have a very special gift.
-[Edward sighs]

2063
01:46:57,916 --> 01:47:01,208
Whatever dish you wish
will appear on this plate.

2064
01:47:01,291 --> 01:47:02,541
-Hmm?
-Oh. Oh.

2065
01:47:02,625 --> 01:47:04,250
That's all that it does. That's--

2066
01:47:04,333 --> 01:47:06,166
-Right? That's-- We're fairly certain.
-Yeah.

2067
01:47:06,833 --> 01:47:08,541
-Maybe you should make the wish.
-Yes.

2068
01:47:08,625 --> 01:47:10,666
-All right. [chuckles, groans]
-[Nancy] Oh!

2069
01:47:10,750 --> 01:47:12,708
[grunts] Excuse me.
I must defend my honor.

2070
01:47:12,791 --> 01:47:14,458
-I declare a do-over!
-I'll go deal with that.

2071
01:47:14,541 --> 01:47:16,375
-Here. Let me help you.
-Yes, of course.

2072
01:47:16,458 --> 01:47:17,625
I'm coming too!

2078
01:47:34,666 --> 01:47:36,125

-Mmm.

2079
01:47:36,208 --> 01:47:38,583
