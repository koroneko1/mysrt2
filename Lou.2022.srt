Hmm.

2
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,208
You think I missed?

3
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:18,541
Well…

4
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,666
Off by four inches.

5
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,291
- That's what I said.
- Plenty of space…

6
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,250
You got any more of these black tarps?

7
00:04:31,958 --> 00:04:34,375
Hey, what do you think you're doin'?
I wanted those.

8
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,375
Gotcha, Lou.

You, uh, ready for the big storm?

20
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:13,208
Makin' a withdrawal.

And, uh, how much
will you be taking out today?

22
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:16,541
Ah, whatever's in there.

00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:01,583
Afternoon, Lou.

33
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,250
Jax is in a good mood.

34
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:08,333
Can't help but wonder if the spark
of the hunt hasn't got him all worked up.

35
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,500
Unlikely. It isn't hunting season.

36
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:13,833
Oh.

37
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,250
Deer must have just bolted out of nowhere.

38
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,458
Happened so fast.

39
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:20,958
Well, I'm glad you and Jax
came out of it okay.

40
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,708
You know, you ought to get yourself
one of these copper bracelets.

41
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:36,041
- Pretty.
- My niece got it for me on the mainland.

42
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:40,041
One of those stores, you know, with the
dream catchers and crystals and whatnot.

43
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,375
I laughed at her.

44
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:45,791
But I swear to God,
I barely feel the arthritis anymore.

45
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:47,291
I'm fishin' again.

46
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,750
Careful you don't get struck by lightning
wearin' that thing.

47
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,791
- Potatoes?
- Uh, yeah.

<i>Don't forget on the 15th,

50
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:09,708

- Of course! I got my ticket.</i>

51

53
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,125
<i>This is a severe weather watch.</i>

54

<i>The biggest storm
the Pacific Northwest has seen in years</i>

<i>and be prepared for downed power lines

58

<i>Ferry service to the San Juan Islands has

59
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,541
<i>as the area is directly
in the storm's path.</i>

60
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,125
Where could she be? I don't know.

61
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:52,708
She's not under this tree.

62
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,000
She's not over here.

63
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,166
Oh, she's so good at hiding.

64
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,083
Ugh.

65
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:00,250
Gotta find her.

66
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,750
Maybe she's inside.

67
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,750
Yeah, I'm gonna check there.

68
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:18,583
I got you!

69
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,125
I got you! I got you!

70
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:23,791
You didn't say the code! Little Rabbit.

71
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,333
Oh! Little Rabbit, Little Rabbit!

72
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:26,958
Little Rabbit!

73
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,208
One more time.

74
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,041
- No.
- Please.

75
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:32,166
I said no, Vee. Come on.

76
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,000
Pass me a nail?

77
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,166
Thanks.

78
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:43,208
Mom, do you think
Daddy's gonna find the treasure soon?

79
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:45,291
It's been two years.

80
00:08:45,791 --> 00:08:47,958
I don't know, Vee. I bet he's real close.

81
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:49,750
And then is Daddy gonna come home?

82
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:54,583
You know,
the storm looks like it's a while away.

83
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:57,250
We could probably fit in another game.

84
00:08:57,333 --> 00:09:00,208
I bet you can't make it past three minutes
before I find you, though.

85
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,500
- Oh, I can.
- Oh, I don't think you can. Mm-mm.

86
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,958
All right. Let me see. Ready? Set…

87
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,125
- Game on!
- Game on!

88
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:09,208
One… two…

89
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:12,875
Three… four…

90
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,333
Five… six…

91
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,833
Seven…

92
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,500
- Hey, Lou.
- Rent. Tomorrow.

93
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,250
I know. Listen, now, I had to lay in
supplies for the storm.

94
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,541
- So I was wondering whether...
- No extensions.

95
00:09:45,583 --> 00:09:48,916
- All right.
- Tomorrow. Inside. On the table.

96
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,958
It'll get wet in the mailbox.

97
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:52,083
You'll get it.

98
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:18,750
Vee!

99
00:10:21,541 --> 00:10:22,458
Oh my God!

100
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,500
Oh…

101
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,250
What the hell is wrong with you?

102
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,000
Why you gotta drive so goddamn fast?
You know there's a child nearby.

103
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,458
World's not a playground.
Teach your kid to look out for herself.

104
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:23,083
Come on, Jax.

105
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:30,791
- Hey.
- Go inside.

106
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,750
- No, Mom!
- Vee, go inside.

107
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,208
Everything o... okay?

108
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:37,500
And no stomping, little girl.

109
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,291
Heading into town to get some supplies.

110
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,833
Can I get you anything?

111
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,125
No. We're fine. Thanks, Chris.

112
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:46,125
- You doin' all right?
- Yeah, I'm just tired.

113
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,291
All right.

114
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,291
Is Lou still bein' a pain in your ass?

115
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,416
- I told you about that?
- Yeah.

116
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,666
Yeah, you don't… you don't remember?

117
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,958
No.

118
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:59,916
- Look, we were both pretty drunk, so…
- Yeah.

119
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,750
- Yeah.
- Clearly, 'cause I… I don't remember that.

120
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,958
I do remember you singing "Like A Virgin"
at the top of your lungs.

121
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,500
Oh, please swear you'll never tell.

122
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,750
Ah…

123
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:11,916
Or what?

124
00:12:12,625 --> 00:12:13,541
I don't know.

125
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,708
Or, uh…

126
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:19,166
Mom! I can't find Mr. Hippo!

127
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,958
- Ah.
- Listen, I gotta go.

128
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,250
Hey, have you, um…

129
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,000
Mom, help me find him.

130
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:29,208
Have you had a chance to talk to Vee yet?

131
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,416
About her dad?

132
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:19,291
You all right?

133
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,208
- Any way I could get a ride?
- Yeah, of course.

134
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,333
- Get in here.
- Thank you.

135
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,666
- Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you.

136
00:13:25,833 --> 00:13:27,708
Sorry about that.

137
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,791
Oh, damn rental car broke down on me.

138
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:32,500
You're a lifesaver.

139
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,416
Oh, jeez, I'm...

140
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,125
I'm gettin' your seat all soaked.

141
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:38,750
Don't worry about it, man.
I'm just glad I passed you when I did.

142
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:41,291
- Oh.
- The storm's gonna be gnarly.

143
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:03,958
Heavy reading.

144
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:06,625
Yeah, I bought it for a friend of mine.

145
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,750
Her ex died three months ago,
and she's just...

146
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,291
She's havin' a hard time facin' it.

147
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,000
I see. And you wanna
help her face it, right? Hm?

148
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,791
'Cause you wanna be more
than just friends?

149
00:14:14,875 --> 00:14:18,458
Oh, look, I just... She has a kid.
She wants to take it slow.

150
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,750
Oh! I love this band.

151
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,291
Oh, Jeff Porcaro's the man.

152
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,375
Ah! Fuck! What the fuck?

153
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:43,375
Vee…

154
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,500
Vee, look at me.

155
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,791
You know when you were asking
about Daddy earlier?

156
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,000
Well, um…

157
00:17:00,541 --> 00:17:02,541
Baby, he, um…

158
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:09,875
He loves you so much.

159
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,041
And he thinks about you all the time.

160
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,041
Um…

161
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:21,500
What are we making?

162
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,791
- Friendship bracelets.
- Oh.

163
00:17:23,875 --> 00:17:25,625
I wanna make a friendship bracelet.

164
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,166
This one is for Lou.

165
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,208
You're making a bracelet for Lou? Why?

166
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:30,791
I like Lou.

167
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,750
- I know you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

168
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,791
Okay. I actually don't like Lou.

169
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,958
But why do you like her?

170
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,875
Well, Jax likes her, and I like Jax.

171
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:44,875
Oh.

172
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:56,541
"<i>I've never been one for many words,</i>
<i>so I'll keep this short."</i>

173
00:17:57,458 --> 00:18:00,125
<i>"The house is yours. Sell it."</i>

174
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:04,208
<i>"There's a month's worth of meat for Jax
in the freezer, and some cash for you."</i>

175
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:10,000
<i>"There are certain decisions I made
that you will never understand."</i>

176
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,708
<i>"But that's all in the past now."</i>

177
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,541
<i>"Life can be cruel."</i>

178
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:21,250
<i>"What made me great at some things
made me lousy at others."</i>

179
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,333
<i>"I wish I could say
that some good came from what I did."</i>

180
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:31,208
<i>"In truth,</i>

181
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,666
<i>I left the world a more dangerous place."</i>

182
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:51,583
Bedtime, now!

183
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:52,750
- Okay.
- My pillow!

184
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:53,916
Okay, lay down.

185
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,541
- Mr. Hippo!
- I'm exhausted. Come on, Mr. Hippo.

186
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,416
- Good night.
- I'm hot.

187
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,083
Yeah, now I'm hot too. But you'll be
cold soon because it's raining.

188
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,583
Oh, it's just the wind, baby.
Don't be scared.

189
00:19:08,666 --> 00:19:10,875
- I'm not scared.
- Okay.

190
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:14,541
- Are you scared?
- Do you wanna sleep with me tonight?

191
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:17,208
- Oh, if you need me to, I will.
- I think I do.

192
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,291
Oh shit.

193
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:22,958
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

194
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,458
Vee…

195
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:26,166
- Watch your mouth.
- Shit!

196
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,208
Hey!

197
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,583
Do not test my patience, little lady.

198
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,208
I'm just gonna go flip the breaker.

199
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,458
I'll be right back, okay?

200
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,708
Mommy?

201
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,166
Is that you?

202
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,000
Chris!

203
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:39,625
Oh! Vee!

204
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,416
No! Vee!

205
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,625
Vee!

206
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,916
Oh! No!

207
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,875
Vee! Vee! Vee!

208
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,958
Vee? Vee!

209
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:56,416
- Where's your phone?
- What the hell?

210
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
Where's your goddamn phone?
I gotta call the sheriff.

211
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,958
- God damn it! Fuck!
- Slow down. What happened?

212
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:08,291
- Vee's gone.
- What, you let her wander off again?

213
00:23:08,375 --> 00:23:10,500
- She's not gonna get far in this.
- No, no, no.

214
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,208
- Her father took her.
- Her father?

215
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:16,416
He's… he's here. How the hell is he here?

216
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,291
Hold on. You saw him?

217
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:20,333
No. I…

218
00:23:20,416 --> 00:23:23,375
He… he's supposed to be dead,
but he found us.

219
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:25,458
I... I thought we were free of him.

220
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,125
- He killed Chris.
- Jesus Christ.

221
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:32,375
Where are your keys? The car won't start.
I gotta get to the sheriff.

222
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,791
- I'll drive.
- Okay.

223
00:23:40,833 --> 00:23:41,791
Hm.

224
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,625
No, no, no, no, no! Come on!

225
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:57,416
- What's wrong?
- Run!

226
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,583
What?

227
00:23:58,666 --> 00:24:00,791
Down!

228
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:17,750
Ho... how did you know
it was gonna blow up?

229
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,208
Bombs tend to.

230
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,000
Sorry about that, buddy.

231
00:24:44,083 --> 00:24:45,500
Turns out I'm not done yet.

232
00:24:45,583 --> 00:24:48,375
A bomb?
It means he's been plannin' this, Lou.

233
00:24:48,875 --> 00:24:51,208
We gotta get more help.
We need to get to the sheriff.

234
00:24:51,291 --> 00:24:53,541
Can't get to him.
No cars. Phones are down.

235
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,041
We're ten miles outside of town.

236
00:24:55,125 --> 00:24:57,250
Your kid's gettin' further away
by the second.

237
00:24:57,333 --> 00:24:59,625
- I have to track 'em.
- What?

238
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,541
Track 'em? You?

239
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:03,291
Get batteries. Kitchen.

240
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:12,416
You don't understand.
Philip was a Green Beret.

241
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:15,875
Wanted for some terrible shit
that he did in Central America.

242
00:25:16,458 --> 00:25:18,041
War crimes kind of shit.

243
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:21,458
I saw the court transcripts.
He was torturing hostages for fun.

244
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:26,083
He's highly trained. An explosives expert.
Well, we're no match for him, Lou.

245
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,541
We need professional help.
You and the dog ain't gonna cut it.

246
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,166
Did he take anything from your trailer?

247
00:25:36,833 --> 00:25:38,958
Her... her favorite stuffy, Mr. Hippo.

248
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:41,500
- And a... a blanket.
- He wants her comfortable.

249
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,333
He wants her quiet.

250
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,375
Renovations.

251
00:26:01,541 --> 00:26:04,416
When they tried to arrest him,
he blew his apartment up.

252
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,875
They sent a death certificate.
How the hell could he still be alive?

253
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:13,125
Halothane. Sleeping gas.

254
00:26:13,708 --> 00:26:15,583
You're lucky it didn't knock you out.

255
00:26:26,375 --> 00:26:28,583
He's pullin' her in somethin'.

256
00:26:28,666 --> 00:26:31,750
If he gets her off the island,
this will get a lot messier.

257
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,666
Airport and ferry are closed.

258
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:40,791
Private vessel. He's headed to the coast.

259
00:26:40,875 --> 00:26:43,125
He's got a head start. I gotta move fast.

260
00:26:43,208 --> 00:26:45,833
Stay here.
The storm clears, head into town.

261
00:26:45,916 --> 00:26:48,000
First house you see, call the sheriff.

262
00:26:51,708 --> 00:26:54,083
- Hey, where are you goin'?
- To find my child.

263
00:26:54,166 --> 00:26:56,000
You don't know what you're doing.

264
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:04,583
If you slow me down,
I will leave you behind.

265
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,291
Jax. Right on.

266
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:48,958
<i>You can't see shit.</i>

267
00:27:49,041 --> 00:27:52,166
<i>We're close. We're clearing the ridge.
We'll be there shortly.</i>

268
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:54,125
Fuckin' idiots.

269
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,083
No. No, no, no. It's okay.

270
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:19,958
I know it's been a while.

271
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Maybe this'll jog your memory.

272
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:26,541
Here's the church…

273
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,500
Here's the steeple…

274
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:32,166
Open it up and…

275
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,125
It's you.

276
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:37,916
Yes, it is. It's... it's me.

277
00:28:38,916 --> 00:28:40,083
It's me, sweetie.

278
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:45,000
You came back from your adventure.

279
00:28:48,083 --> 00:28:49,208
I sure did.

280
00:28:50,791 --> 00:28:52,833
And… and I even brought you a present.

281
00:28:56,041 --> 00:28:57,583
Is it part of the treasure?

282
00:28:58,291 --> 00:29:00,041
Uh, treasure? Yeah!

283
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,250
Yeah, it sure is.

284
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:06,916
And… you and I are gonna go
on our own adventure together.

285
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,791
Where's Mo... Where's Mommy?
Is she coming with us?

286
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,000
Yeah, of course she is. Of course she is.

287
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,458
I left her a note
and some clues to follow us,

288
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:22,208
and she's gonna
meet up with us after, okay?

289
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,000
Uh... Whoa.

290
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,000
What do you say?

291
00:29:31,291 --> 00:29:32,291
Thank you, Daddy.

292
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,833
- Okay.
<i>- Do you copy?</i>

293
00:29:37,333 --> 00:29:38,875
<i>Come on. Get on radio.</i>

294
00:29:38,958 --> 00:29:41,750
<i>- Do you copy?</i>
- All right, I've gotta do one more thing.

295
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,500
And then you and I are gonna start
our adventure together.

296
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:47,708
See, you put these on…
All right, like that.

297
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:49,083
Okay?

298
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:58,458
Here.

299
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,666
You see anything?

300
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:53,291
- You know them?
- Tony and Gerry. They served with Philip.

301
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:56,791
They're just as vicious as he is. Come on.

302
00:31:56,875 --> 00:32:00,708
Stay down. Your jacket might as well
have a target painted on it.

303
00:32:01,666 --> 00:32:02,958
We wait.

304
00:32:04,125 --> 00:32:07,791
Suppose this is just a distraction?
Buying him more time to get away with Vee.

305
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:09,541
It's the kind of game he likes to play.

306
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,416
Danglin' somethin' shiny in front of you,

307
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,750
and you don't notice when he's about
to bash you over your goddamn head.

308
00:32:20,458 --> 00:32:22,375
Do you know how to use this?

309
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,083
Mmm, yeah.

310
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:28,125
- I took lessons after I left him.
- All right, I'm gonna go have a look.

311
00:32:28,958 --> 00:32:32,000
If anybody gets too close, use this.

312
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,666
Go for the eyes.
A man can't kill what he can't see.

313
00:32:37,125 --> 00:32:39,375
- How do you know all this?
- Girl Scouts.

314
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:42,458
Jax. Stay.

315
00:33:06,416 --> 00:33:08,791
All right, no one's gonna
follow him in this shit.

316
00:33:10,291 --> 00:33:13,541
I'm telling you, this feels like another
one of Philip's fucked-up games.

317
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,375
Hello?

318
00:33:37,083 --> 00:33:41,250
Oh, excuse me.
I'm completely turned around out here. I...

319
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:44,166
I… I was looking for my dog.
The poor little guy...

320
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:45,833
I haven't seen any dogs.

321
00:33:45,916 --> 00:33:49,000
Okay. Do… do you have a phone I could use?

322
00:33:49,083 --> 00:33:50,375
- I just want...
- Are you alone?

323
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:53,333
Unfortunately. Um…

324
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,250
Look, I... I don't think I can make it
the three hours back home, but…

325
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:09,500
If I could just rest
and get my… my bearings?

326
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,500
Christ.

327
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:20,500
- Okay. Just two minutes.
- Oh!

328
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:22,666
Thank you so much.

329
00:34:22,750 --> 00:34:23,916
Oh shit.

330
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,500
Oh, bless your heart.

331
00:34:27,625 --> 00:34:28,666
Oh…

332
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:30,791
Oh, good morning.

333
00:34:30,875 --> 00:34:32,750
She lost her dog, man. She's soaked.

334
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:34,791
Just need to get my blood movin' again.

335
00:34:35,291 --> 00:34:37,333
My goodness. Quite a storm out there.

336
00:34:39,791 --> 00:34:41,916
Whew.

337
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,166
- Oh.
- What's your name?

338
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,833
Oh, sorry, I'm... I'm Martha. Flemming.

339
00:34:50,583 --> 00:34:52,166
But you might know my husband, Gordon.

340
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,791
- He works at the...
- I don't.

341
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:00,708
Here. Why don't you grab a seat?

342
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:04,000
- Give those cold feet a break.
- They sure could use it.

343
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:05,875
Thank you.

344
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:15,250
Thank you so much.

345
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:17,583
Ooh.

346
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:22,250
- Oof…
- So… been on this island long?

347
00:35:22,333 --> 00:35:25,583
- Oh, 32 years.
- I don't get the appeal.

348
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,125
It's a pain in the ass to get to.

349
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,916
Weather's shit.

350
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,958
It's an acquired taste.

351
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,875
I love it, though.

352
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,333
- Good place to hide, I reckon.
- Hmm.

353
00:35:36,416 --> 00:35:38,291
Come on, Tony, relax.
She's just an old lady.

354
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:48,458
The soup smells so good.

355
00:35:53,333 --> 00:35:55,333
Ooh.

356
00:35:57,166 --> 00:35:58,958
So nice and warm in here.

357
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,166
That must be my Jax.

358
00:36:06,166 --> 00:36:07,083
Sit down, Martha.

359
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,708
Where is he taking her?

360
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,291
Where…

361
00:37:35,791 --> 00:37:37,500
…is he taking her?

362
00:37:40,041 --> 00:37:42,125
Eagle Bay.

363
00:37:43,791 --> 00:37:44,958
And then where?

364
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:47,166
I don't know.

365
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,583
I swear. That's all I know.

366
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,750
You gonna shoot me?

367
00:38:06,541 --> 00:38:08,833
Oh…

368
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:13,083
Things, uh…

369
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,833
Escalated.

370
00:38:31,791 --> 00:38:33,000
Oh!

371
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:37,250
Jax. What'd I tell you about that?

372
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:46,916
Gerry, he say anything about Vee
before you killed him?

373
00:38:50,625 --> 00:38:51,458
Not a word.

374
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,833
Here. Take this outside. Go through it.

375
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:43,625
Hello? Come on!

376
00:39:43,708 --> 00:39:44,708
Turn that thing off.

377
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:47,833
- We might be able to reach the sheriff.
- Not in this weather.

378
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,583
More likely it'll tip off Philip.

379
00:39:49,666 --> 00:39:53,000
- What channel would the emergency...
- Don't argue with me. Leave it.

380
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:57,916
Unbelievable.

381
00:40:14,291 --> 00:40:16,125
You know, I was in the Girl Scouts, too.

382
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:20,791
Got my archery badge, pen pal, first aid.

383
00:40:20,875 --> 00:40:25,125
There wasn't one for hand-to-hand combat
or murder with household objects.

384
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:28,125
Really? Must've just been my troop, then.

385
00:40:30,375 --> 00:40:32,583
What branch of the military were you in?

386
00:40:38,625 --> 00:40:39,625
CIA.

387
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,833
26 years in the field.

388
00:40:43,416 --> 00:40:44,375
A spy?

389
00:40:45,416 --> 00:40:48,708
- Wouldn't have guessed that.
- Be a shit spy if you did.

390
00:40:52,208 --> 00:40:54,041
Come on, Jax.

391
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:23,125
- Daddy?
- Yeah!

392
00:41:23,208 --> 00:41:24,333
I need to pee.

393
00:41:24,958 --> 00:41:27,333
- Can... can you hold it?
- Nuh-uh.

394
00:42:12,833 --> 00:42:14,708
Hello?

395
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,208
Damn it.

396
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,375
Hello, hello. Is anyone there?

397
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:36,916
Let's go!

398
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,125
Okay, come on, Vee.

399
00:42:46,458 --> 00:42:47,625
Vee?

400
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:50,791
Vee!

401
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:05,750
Let me see?

402
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:11,625
Yeah. No, he's got...
He's got a bad wing, Vee.

403
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:14,541
Yeah. You know…

404
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:18,541
Sometimes, in nature, when a…

405
00:43:19,833 --> 00:43:21,333
Creature's damaged…

406
00:43:23,708 --> 00:43:25,625
There's nothing you can do to save them.

407
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:29,583
It's almost like they were meant to die.

408
00:43:32,666 --> 00:43:34,500
But maybe he's just tired.

409
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:38,541
Maybe. Yeah.

410
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:42,625
Uh… Here. We'll put him right up here.

411
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,291
- All right. Come on.
- Wait, I haven't peed yet.

412
00:44:24,666 --> 00:44:26,666
Come on, Vee. Now!

413
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:28,333
Fuck!

414
00:44:35,291 --> 00:44:36,583
- Fuck.
- What's hurtin'?

415
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,125
Nothin'.

416
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,833
Come on. We gotta keep movin'.

417
00:44:57,833 --> 00:45:00,083
Fucking kidding me!

418
00:45:00,666 --> 00:45:02,500
Damn it. Fuck!

419
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:17,208
Hi. We have to walk now, okay?

420
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:32,125
- I need a break.
- Huh?

421
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,916
I need a break to warm up.

422
00:45:35,875 --> 00:45:37,083
No time, Lou.

423
00:45:37,166 --> 00:45:40,500
He takes breaks too.
I can tell by the tracks. Come on.

424
00:45:58,916 --> 00:46:00,458
Oh, God damn it!

425
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:02,666
Oh shit.

426
00:46:05,208 --> 00:46:06,583
I'm not too cold.

427
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:09,166
You?

428
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:31,875
Shit.

429
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:35,166
You walked a long way on that.
You should've said somethin'.

430
00:46:36,625 --> 00:46:38,875
And give you an excuse to abandon me?

431
00:46:40,291 --> 00:46:41,250
Aah.

432
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:49,250
Is that for me?

433
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,250
No.

434
00:46:52,333 --> 00:46:53,583
Well, can I have some?

435
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,291
Thanks.

436
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:53,833
And yet you stayed.

437
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:58,250
Well, should've done somethin'.

438
00:48:00,208 --> 00:48:01,166
Yeah.

439
00:48:02,125 --> 00:48:05,250
Thanks, Lou. That's… very helpful.

440
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:07,541
Just saying you could've left him sooner.

441
00:48:12,791 --> 00:48:15,291
What is it you know
about being with someone like him?

442
00:48:21,666 --> 00:48:23,458
So maybe don't tell me
what I should have done.

443
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:28,291
I didn't recognize who I was with him.

444
00:48:30,666 --> 00:48:32,666
I actually felt I could fix him.

445
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:37,625
You know, when we met,
he was loving, he was caring…

446
00:48:37,708 --> 00:48:40,000
But so broken.

447
00:48:47,916 --> 00:48:49,208
For so long, I thought…

448
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:51,625
Thought it was all me.

449
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,291
I thought…

450
00:48:56,375 --> 00:49:01,541
"Why am I failing him?
Why isn't my love enough?"

451
00:49:05,291 --> 00:49:06,375
I don't know.

452
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:11,666
That son of a bitch is a monster.

453
00:49:13,125 --> 00:49:15,125
Whatever the hell made him this way.

454
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:20,250
There ain't no amount of love
in this entire world

455
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:22,250
that's gonna be able to save that man.

456
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,166
He ever hurt Vee?

457
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:36,875
No.

458
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:39,625
Not yet.

459
00:49:41,083 --> 00:49:44,333
When he would get into his moods,

460
00:49:44,416 --> 00:49:47,416
I'd whisper to her, "Game on,"

461
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:49,916
and she'd run and hide.

462
00:49:54,083 --> 00:49:57,125
Actually made it into a… a goddamn game.

463
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:03,166
How pathetic is that?

464
00:50:05,333 --> 00:50:09,750
He always said,
if I took Vee away, he'd kill us both.

465
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:16,833
Go on…

466
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,250
Tell me what I should've done.

467
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:26,416
I guess we've all been through things
other people will never understand.

468
00:50:32,750 --> 00:50:33,791
Hannah?

469
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:37,041
We'll get her back.

470
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,583
Oh…

471
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:30,625
Come on.

472
00:51:36,333 --> 00:51:38,708
Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit.

473
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:44,041
Slow and steady.

474
00:51:47,750 --> 00:51:48,750
Home, Jax.

475
00:51:49,666 --> 00:51:51,416
No arguments. Home.

476
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:52,416
Now!

477
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:57,291
Oh shit.

478
00:52:01,958 --> 00:52:03,000
Ah…

479
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:05,791
How the hell did he do this with Vee?

480
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:21,708
Gotta climb around it.

481
00:52:22,291 --> 00:52:23,416
Oh shit.

482
00:52:37,875 --> 00:52:39,666
Whoa!

483
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,791
- Aah!
- Come on!

484
00:52:53,666 --> 00:52:54,625
I got you.

485
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:57,791
Good job.

486
00:53:11,166 --> 00:53:12,333
Oh!

487
00:53:16,708 --> 00:53:17,583
Shit.

488
00:53:17,666 --> 00:53:19,625
Jesus.

489
00:53:20,416 --> 00:53:22,208
Not now. God damn it.

490
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:26,708
- Lou, what's the matter?
- Nothing.

491
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:32,041
Lou!

492
00:54:06,166 --> 00:54:07,458
Oh God.

493
00:54:07,541 --> 00:54:09,541
Lou, wake up. Lou.

494
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,375
Oh…

495
00:54:11,458 --> 00:54:13,458
Oh, thank God.

496
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,500
Let me help you up.

497
00:54:14,583 --> 00:54:16,583
Get off me.

498
00:54:23,791 --> 00:54:25,708
I can help you if you just let me.

499
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:27,416
I don't need your help.

500
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,541
Oh, fuck!

501
00:54:37,041 --> 00:54:39,958
Get up.
We just lost an hour on him.

502
00:55:26,416 --> 00:55:28,958
Hey, I told you to leave that behind.

503
00:55:29,041 --> 00:55:32,041
Storm's passed.
I'm gonna climb up to that hilltop.

504
00:55:32,125 --> 00:55:33,916
- Try to connect.
- There's no time.

505
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:37,416
God damn it. Can you stop
bein' so stubborn? We need help.

506
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,583
- There is no one who can help us.
- Shit.

507
00:55:39,666 --> 00:55:43,666
- I'm all you've got. Now keep movin'.
- Why are you helpin' me, Lou?

508
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,500
- Huh?
- Eagle Bay's just ahead.

509
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,708
- Don't slow me down.
- God damn it.

510
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:02,541
We missed them.

511
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,833
No one's comin' or goin'
in water this rough.

512
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,958
- Then what's his plan?
- Over here.

513
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:00,458
Vee!

514
00:57:01,416 --> 00:57:02,291
Vee!

515
00:57:03,458 --> 00:57:05,333
- Where did you take her?
- Stop.

516
00:57:05,416 --> 00:57:07,500
He's fucking with you.

517
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:11,458
We can do this all day.

518
00:57:39,458 --> 00:57:41,875
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we do need help.

519
00:57:44,083 --> 00:57:45,625
Go back to that hill.

520
00:57:46,125 --> 00:57:49,708
See if you can raise Rankin.
Emergency services are channel 16.

521
00:57:49,791 --> 00:57:51,625
Meet me back here when you're done.

522
00:57:52,416 --> 00:57:53,458
Thank you.

523
00:57:54,291 --> 00:57:55,875
What are you gonna do?

524
00:57:55,958 --> 00:57:57,250
I need to rest.

525
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,500
Go on.

526
00:57:59,916 --> 00:58:01,166
Hey, hold up.

527
00:58:03,708 --> 00:58:05,333
Try not to blow your brains out.

528
00:59:24,291 --> 00:59:25,708
There we are.

529
00:59:26,791 --> 00:59:27,875
Frozen in time.

530
00:59:28,666 --> 00:59:30,083
Together forever.

531
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:32,041
Wanna do another one?

532
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:41,625
Did you know…

533
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:48,000
That there are hand prints like these
in caves all over the world?

534
00:59:48,083 --> 00:59:51,333
And long after you
and Mommy and I are all dead…

535
00:59:52,750 --> 00:59:55,708
These hand prints are still gonna be here.

536
01:00:50,791 --> 01:00:52,458
Hello?

537
01:00:53,625 --> 01:00:56,708
<i>Hello?
Can anyone hear me? Hello?</i>

538
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:02,041
Can anybody hear me?

539
01:01:04,416 --> 01:01:05,333
Hello?

540
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,083
Hello, anybody?

541
01:01:08,166 --> 01:01:09,625
- God damn it.
<i>- This is Sheriff Rankin.</i>

542
01:01:09,708 --> 01:01:10,958
<i>Who is this? Over.</i>

543
01:01:11,041 --> 01:01:13,333
Sheriff! Sheriff Rankin.

544
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:14,875
Oh God. Thank God.

545
01:01:14,958 --> 01:01:16,250
This is... this is Hannah Dawson.

546
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:19,416
<i>…kidnapped.</i>

547
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,500
Kidnapped?

548
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,375
Hannah, can you hear me?

549
01:01:24,458 --> 01:01:25,833
<i>Can you repeat that, please?</i>

550
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,250
Uh... Okay.

551
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:29,708
My daughter
was kidnapped by her father.

552
01:01:29,791 --> 01:01:32,250
<i>I'm…</i>

553
01:01:32,333 --> 01:01:33,583
<i>Lou Adell is with me…</i>

554
01:01:33,666 --> 01:01:35,208
Hannah, can you please confirm?

555
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,458
<i>Hannah Dawson?
Can you hear me?</i>

556
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:38,625
What?

557
01:01:38,708 --> 01:01:40,083
<i>Say that… say that again?</i>

558
01:01:40,166 --> 01:01:41,666
Come on, come on, come on.

559
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:42,833
Sheriff?

560
01:01:43,958 --> 01:01:46,708
Oh fuck. Okay…

561
01:01:47,750 --> 01:01:48,750
Shit.

562
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:51,666
Torres, come in.

563
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:55,583
- <i>Go, Sheriff.</i>
- Listen, we got a situation.

564
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:57,416
This is gonna sound a bit crazy,

565
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:02,250
but I think Hannah Dawson's daughter
has been kidnapped by… by her father.

566
01:02:03,291 --> 01:02:04,333
<i>What?</i>

567
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:08,833
Listen, let's put it on the wire,
right away,

568
01:02:08,916 --> 01:02:10,750
in case she's taken off the island.

569
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:14,791
Okay? Hannah and Vee Dawson and Lou Adell.

570
01:02:14,875 --> 01:02:16,250
I think she mentioned Lou.

571
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,125
The guns.

572
01:03:52,125 --> 01:03:53,041
Slowly.

573
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:30,791
Hello, Philip.

574
01:04:34,833 --> 01:04:35,958
Don't worry about her.

575
01:04:36,916 --> 01:04:39,041
I've made sure she'll sleep through this.

576
01:04:39,833 --> 01:04:42,291
Just tell me one thing.
And be honest here.

577
01:04:43,666 --> 01:04:45,125
Why'd you sell me out?

578
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:51,708
I knew you'd track down Hannah and Vee
sooner or later.

579
01:04:51,791 --> 01:04:53,666
I wasn't gonna be able
to protect them forever.

580
01:04:53,750 --> 01:04:56,875
Protect them?
All of this is happening because of you.

581
01:04:58,416 --> 01:05:01,708
Okay? And Hannah may be too naive
to... to see it, but I don't.

582
01:05:01,791 --> 01:05:03,333
Hannah doesn't know who I am.

583
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:12,666
You still can't even admit I'm your son.

584
01:05:18,958 --> 01:05:21,791
So what's the plan, Philip?
Why the elaborate chase?

585
01:05:22,291 --> 01:05:24,708
Why let us track you?
You don't wanna hurt your kid.

586
01:05:24,791 --> 01:05:28,708
Did you know that Vee is the same age
as I was when those... those men took me?

587
01:05:30,041 --> 01:05:32,500
Yeah, but they weren't as nice as, uh…

588
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,041
As I'm being to her.

589
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:39,875
Can you appreciate that?
The symmetry of that?

590
01:05:42,291 --> 01:05:44,708
I thought my mommy
was comin' back to save me, too.

591
01:05:44,791 --> 01:05:48,458
It was a trap. If I'd tried to save you,
they would have had us both.

592
01:05:48,541 --> 01:05:50,375
Bullshit. You wanted
to maintain your cover.

593
01:05:50,458 --> 01:05:52,583
I was a pawn for your mission.
Nothin' else.

594
01:05:52,666 --> 01:05:57,291
- I had you rescued. I got you out of Iran.
- Then why didn't you come back with me?

595
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:58,416
Here's why.

596
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:02,875
Because you chose the fucking CIA
over your own child.

597
01:06:04,041 --> 01:06:06,041
Yeah, how'd that work out for you? Hmm?

598
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:09,291
I mean, did you guys fuck up anything
worse than you fucked up Iran?

599
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:14,416
And then you steal my wife
and... and my kid...

600
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:17,416
Hannah and Vee had nothing to do
with my mistakes. Leave them out of this.

601
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:19,583
Oh, spare me the fuckin' morality lesson.

602
01:06:19,666 --> 01:06:21,666
You gave up that right a long time ago.

603
01:06:24,458 --> 01:06:25,625
It's not too late.

604
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:29,791
You move, I'mma put a bullet in you.

605
01:06:31,333 --> 01:06:32,541
It's not too late.

606
01:06:33,333 --> 01:06:35,500
Leave Vee with me and go.

607
01:06:36,625 --> 01:06:38,250
I'll throw them off your trail.

608
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:41,875
Philip, listen to me.

609
01:06:41,958 --> 01:06:43,041
You're right.

610
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:45,833
I didn't protect you when you were a kid.

611
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:47,208
So let me do it now.

612
01:06:48,875 --> 01:06:49,833
Shut up.

613
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:51,333
What, you wanna kill me?

614
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:53,500
Do it.

615
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:58,291
Before I knew you took Vee last night,
I had my rifle pressed against my head.

616
01:06:58,375 --> 01:06:59,416
I'm not afraid to go.

617
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:04,041
You just can't stop
messin' with my head, can't you?

618
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:05,833
Kid, I wouldn't even know where to start.

619
01:07:07,250 --> 01:07:10,083
The minute I heard you blew yourself up,
I knew it was time.

620
01:07:10,166 --> 01:07:13,208
I thought Hannah and Vee were safe.
My mission was complete.

621
01:07:13,291 --> 01:07:14,750
But you tricked me there, didn't you?

622
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,166
You always were smarter than me.

623
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:23,666
Beat my ass at chess
when you were five years old.

624
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,416
Remember that?

625
01:07:30,291 --> 01:07:31,291
I do.

626
01:07:37,375 --> 01:07:38,708
Oh, Philip.

627
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:41,708
You know what?

628
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:48,125
For once, we're playin' my game.

629
01:07:59,333 --> 01:08:01,208
It's time to end this legacy.

630
01:08:01,291 --> 01:08:03,958
Put this whole family out of its misery.

631
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:08,208
Philip,

632
01:08:08,791 --> 01:08:10,125
you're her father.

633
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:12,166
And you're my mother.

634
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:16,916
Oh my God…

635
01:09:27,708 --> 01:09:29,166
<i>No!</i>

636
01:09:33,041 --> 01:09:34,916
<i>Mom! Mom!</i>

637
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:39,958
We'll be waiting for you
at the lighthouse.

638
01:09:40,541 --> 01:09:42,000
Make sure you bring Hannah.

639
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,750
Don't take too long.

640
01:09:48,791 --> 01:09:49,791
Fuck.

641
01:09:58,833 --> 01:10:01,583
<i>Just checking in on ya.
How are you doing out there?</i>

642
01:10:01,666 --> 01:10:04,458
- Talk to me, Deputy.
- Still no hits on the APBs.

643
01:10:04,541 --> 01:10:07,666
I notified ATF about the bomb in the truck
and the coroner about the body.

644
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:10,250
They're sending teams
when the weather lets up.

645
01:10:13,666 --> 01:10:15,625
Orcas Island Sheriff's Department.

646
01:10:15,708 --> 01:10:16,750
Yes, sir.

647
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:19,125
Sheriff, it's the federal marshals.

648
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:24,958
- This is Rankin. Who's this?
<i>- Sheriff, Dominick Crown here.</i>

649
01:10:25,041 --> 01:10:26,666
<i>Did you receive
our facsimile transmission?</i>

650
01:10:26,750 --> 01:10:28,083
Yeah, I got it right here.

651
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:31,875
<i>We've seen the APB
for the woman you know as Lou Adell.</i>

652
01:10:31,958 --> 01:10:34,000
<i>Is she a match
for the person in that photo?</i>

653
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:36,125
Yeah.
Yeah, it sure looks like her.

654
01:10:36,208 --> 01:10:38,416
<i>- How confident are you, Sheriff?</i>
- It's her.

655
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:41,000
<i>And the second individual?</i>

656
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:43,541
Hang on one second.

657
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:45,208
<i>Do you recognize him?</i>

658
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:48,250
No. Are you telling me
that this guy is involved?

659
01:10:48,333 --> 01:10:51,125
<i>Do you have any intel
on the location of these individuals?</i>

660
01:10:51,208 --> 01:10:53,500
<i>- Are they together?</i>
- Well, I don't know if they're together.

661
01:10:53,583 --> 01:10:57,250
What I believe is that they're headed to
Eagle Bay, on the west side of our island.

662
01:10:57,333 --> 01:11:00,250
<i>We need to make sure no civilians
go anywhere near that location.</i>

663
01:11:00,333 --> 01:11:01,958
<i>Set up roadblocks and cordon the area.</i>

664
01:11:02,041 --> 01:11:04,500
There's a kidnapped girl
and her mother out there.

665
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:07,083
<i>- Hold.</i>
- Excuse me?

666
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:11,708
Asshole put me on hold. Unbelievable.

667
01:11:13,791 --> 01:11:14,916
Un-fuckin'-believable.

668
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:17,291
- <i>Sheriff Rankin?</i>
- Yeah, right here.

669
01:11:17,375 --> 01:11:19,916
<i>The male fugitive
is US Army Special Forces,</i>

670
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,500
<i>convicted in the murder
of numerous civilians.</i>

671
01:11:22,583 --> 01:11:25,750
<i>The female is a high-priority target
for the CIA.</i>

672
01:11:25,833 --> 01:11:27,500
The CIA? Lou Adell?

673
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:31,000
<i>This investigation is now under
the jurisdiction of the US Marshals.</i>

674
01:11:31,083 --> 01:11:33,000
<i>Lethal force has been authorized.</i>

675
01:11:33,083 --> 01:11:35,083
<i>Do not allow any approach to Eagle Bay.</i>

676
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:37,166
<i>- Not by your department, not...</i>
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

677
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:40,291
There... there is a kidnapped girl
and her mother out there.

678
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:42,166
<i>Stay out of our way, Sheriff.</i>

679
01:11:53,416 --> 01:11:55,958
Lou, sorry it took me so long.

680
01:11:56,041 --> 01:11:59,166
I tried to get as high as I could, but…

681
01:11:59,250 --> 01:12:02,166
Jesus. Oh shit.

682
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:05,583
Oh God, oh God, oh God. Okay, wait, wait.
Let me help. Let me help.

683
01:12:07,833 --> 01:12:09,666
Did he do this?

684
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:12,500
And Vee? Is she… is she all right?

685
01:12:12,583 --> 01:12:16,458
She's okay for now.
He's taking her to the lighthouse.

686
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,416
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.
- Wait.

687
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,125
- Move your hand right now.
- Okay…

688
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:22,083
Do it quick...

689
01:12:24,375 --> 01:12:25,583
Oh shit.

690
01:12:25,666 --> 01:12:28,375
- Pack the wound.
- I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm coming.

691
01:12:28,875 --> 01:12:31,583
Fill it with gauze.
As... as much as you can.

692
01:12:31,666 --> 01:12:33,666
Oh God.

693
01:12:34,583 --> 01:12:36,208
- Oh shit.
- Come on, deeper.

694
01:12:36,291 --> 01:12:38,500
- Really pack it in.
- I'm trying.

695
01:12:38,583 --> 01:12:40,125
Jesus, Lou.

696
01:12:40,208 --> 01:12:42,583
I'm so sorry I dragged you into this.

697
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:44,583
Put your hand here. Right. Press down.

698
01:12:44,666 --> 01:12:46,500
Okay, good. I gotta...
I gotta grab some tape.

699
01:12:46,583 --> 01:12:49,291
Hannah. Did you reach the sheriff?

700
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:50,916
- Uh, I don't know.
- Leave it.

701
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,583
- Wait, uh...
- It's fine.

702
01:13:05,208 --> 01:13:07,625
I found those at the cabin.
I meant to tell you.

703
01:13:10,750 --> 01:13:11,750
You're lying.

704
01:13:36,458 --> 01:13:38,125
This message isn't for me, is it?

705
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,416
None of them are.

706
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:49,541
Say it.

707
01:13:51,208 --> 01:13:52,583
I need you to say it.

708
01:13:57,208 --> 01:13:58,208
Say it!

709
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:02,791
He's… my son.

710
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:13,708
When I was stationed in Iran, I had
to get close to a very dangerous man.

711
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:15,791
Very close.

712
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:17,958
No, no, no, no.

713
01:14:18,458 --> 01:14:19,500
Oh God…

714
01:14:20,041 --> 01:14:22,125
I kept the baby to keep my cover.

715
01:14:22,208 --> 01:14:25,958
You mean… you mean Philip?
The baby? You mean your son?

716
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:28,916
So what is this? Some game?

717
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,083
You fucking with me?
What, you tell him where we were, or…

718
01:14:32,166 --> 01:14:34,500
- What... what is this?
- No. I wasn't helping him.

719
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:37,250
- I was helping you. You and Vee.
- Stop lying to me.

720
01:14:37,333 --> 01:14:39,333
Tell me the goddamn truth!

721
01:14:40,458 --> 01:14:43,000
I got you to this island.

722
01:14:43,083 --> 01:14:44,958
Your old friend from college?

723
01:14:45,041 --> 01:14:49,208
The one who told you about the beautiful
secluded place on Orcas Island

724
01:14:49,291 --> 01:14:51,000
with the cheap rent?

725
01:14:51,083 --> 01:14:54,208
I had her run into you on the street.

726
01:14:57,666 --> 01:14:59,666
I tried to stop him.

727
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:03,416
I blackmailed the CIA

728
01:15:03,500 --> 01:15:06,416
to force an investigation
into what he did in El Salvador.

729
01:15:07,250 --> 01:15:10,166
- You think you saved us?
- I knew he'd track you eventually.

730
01:15:10,250 --> 01:15:13,583
You didn't save us.
I got Vee away from him.

731
01:15:14,833 --> 01:15:17,333
I took care of her every goddamn day
and made sure she was safe.

732
01:15:17,416 --> 01:15:19,916
Now she's out there with him
because of you.

733
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:22,208
You're no damn hero.
You're a fucking coward.

734
01:15:22,291 --> 01:15:24,625
- Wow.
- All that rage that that man felt.

735
01:15:24,708 --> 01:15:26,708
All the rage inside of that man
that he felt,

736
01:15:26,791 --> 01:15:29,833
that he aimed towards me,
is because of you.

737
01:15:29,916 --> 01:15:32,541
Not everybody is meant to be a mother.

738
01:15:39,875 --> 01:15:41,166
Yeah, maybe not.

739
01:15:43,375 --> 01:15:45,583
But you could have been
a little more human.

740
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:50,166
You drove past our trailer every day.

741
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:52,625
You drove past
your own granddaughter, Lou.

742
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:56,500
You didn't talk to her.
You didn't speak to her.

743
01:15:56,583 --> 01:15:58,416
You didn't look at her.

744
01:15:59,208 --> 01:16:02,250
What kind of person
could do that to their own family?

745
01:16:07,250 --> 01:16:10,125
Come on. We gotta keep moving.

746
01:16:10,208 --> 01:16:11,541
There ain't no more "we."

747
01:16:11,625 --> 01:16:13,916
Hannah, you don't know
where they're going.

748
01:16:14,000 --> 01:16:16,625
You said the lighthouse.
I'll follow the coastline.

749
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:19,083
Not on your own. It's a trap.

750
01:16:19,166 --> 01:16:23,291
- Please. There's one thing I'm good for.
- Not anymore.

751
01:16:23,875 --> 01:16:25,333
You'll just slow me down.

752
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:06,208
<i>Mama!</i>

753
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,708
<i>Mama!</i>

754
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:09,833
<i>Mama! Mom!</i>

755
01:18:09,791 --> 01:18:10,833
Jax.

756
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,000
Lou!

757
01:18:23,083 --> 01:18:24,500
Are you okay?

758
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:27,541
Never thought I'd be excited to see you.

759
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:29,166
First time for everything.

760
01:18:29,250 --> 01:18:31,250
- Where's Hannah?
- On her way to the lighthouse.

761
01:18:31,333 --> 01:18:32,833
And her daughter?

762
01:18:32,916 --> 01:18:35,208
- Already there with the…
- Okay.

763
01:18:36,583 --> 01:18:37,500
…the kidnapper.

764
01:18:38,208 --> 01:18:41,750
He's armed. Very dangerous.

765
01:18:41,833 --> 01:18:43,833
That's exactly what the feds said
about you.

766
01:18:44,333 --> 01:18:47,416
You stay here. I'll send someone for you
as soon as the road's clear.

767
01:18:47,500 --> 01:18:51,416
Wait. For fuck's sake, help me outside.
I'm suffocating in here.

768
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:54,083
Come on. I got this.

769
01:18:55,625 --> 01:18:58,041
You gonna tell me why
the CIA's lookin' for you, Lou?

770
01:18:58,125 --> 01:19:00,166
I used some evidence I held onto.

771
01:19:00,250 --> 01:19:01,833
What kind of evidence?

772
01:19:03,500 --> 01:19:07,083
Documents. Proving CIA involvement
in the coup in Iran.

773
01:19:07,166 --> 01:19:10,208
Ah. I can see why
they'd be pissed about that.

774
01:19:10,291 --> 01:19:12,208
Lou, they're on their way.

775
01:19:12,291 --> 01:19:14,583
Fuck, they won't care
about collateral damage.

776
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:16,541
You gotta get Hannah and Vee out of there.

777
01:19:16,625 --> 01:19:17,583
- Ow!
- Here.

778
01:19:17,666 --> 01:19:18,500
Come on.

779
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,291
This thing starts up again,
I'm gonna bleed out.

780
01:19:23,583 --> 01:19:26,166
Will you get the first-aid kit?
I left it in there.

781
01:19:34,750 --> 01:19:35,875
Okay.

782
01:19:41,791 --> 01:19:43,791
Lou! Lou!

783
01:19:48,666 --> 01:19:50,125
You gotta be kidding me.

784
01:19:50,208 --> 01:19:51,291
Lou!

785
01:19:52,208 --> 01:19:53,250
Mommy!

786
01:19:55,125 --> 01:19:56,333
- Mommy!
- Vee!

787
01:19:57,083 --> 01:19:59,416
Come! Please, come!

788
01:19:59,500 --> 01:20:01,791
- Vee!
- I'm here, Mama!

789
01:20:01,875 --> 01:20:03,791
- Up here!
- I'm coming!

790
01:20:29,416 --> 01:20:32,166
Baby?

791
01:20:43,041 --> 01:20:44,083
Mommy!

792
01:20:44,166 --> 01:20:45,208
Hi, Mommy.

793
01:20:45,291 --> 01:20:46,666
Hi, baby.

794
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:49,208
We were afraid you weren't gonna show up.
Weren't we, Vee?

795
01:20:49,291 --> 01:20:50,375
You okay?

796
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:53,250
Of course she's okay.
She's with her daddy.

797
01:20:59,916 --> 01:21:01,291
Come, give Mommy a hug.

798
01:21:04,416 --> 01:21:07,916
Hey, how's... how's Lou doin'?
Is she... Is she on her way?

799
01:21:08,916 --> 01:21:11,208
Jesus, look at me.

800
01:21:12,333 --> 01:21:15,666
Still waitin' for my mommy to come back
after all these years, huh?

801
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,291
But we do need her here to finish this.

802
01:21:23,208 --> 01:21:25,583
I wanna give Mommy a hug.

803
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:28,625
Well…

804
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:37,000
Philip, please.

805
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:48,166
Please, Daddy?

806
01:21:49,041 --> 01:21:50,458
Okay, Vee.

807
01:21:50,541 --> 01:21:52,375
One quick hug while we wait for Lou.

808
01:21:55,375 --> 01:21:57,666
Oh, I missed you so much.

809
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:11,583
Game on.

810
01:22:16,833 --> 01:22:18,916
Daddy, may I go to the bathroom?

811
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:28,333
Of course you can, Vee.

812
01:22:28,833 --> 01:22:31,625
But hey… Come right back, okay?

813
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:47,333
Wow, Lou is really rubbin' off on you.

814
01:22:49,458 --> 01:22:52,333
Come on, just give me the gun.
We both know you're not gonna shoot me.

815
01:22:52,916 --> 01:22:56,125
You don't know me, Phil. You never did.

816
01:22:56,791 --> 01:22:58,041
No?

817
01:22:58,125 --> 01:23:01,291
I know that if you were gonna shoot me,
you would have done it years ago.

818
01:23:04,875 --> 01:23:07,000
I know that you're not like Lou and me.

819
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:11,000
You're not.

820
01:23:11,083 --> 01:23:13,208
Yeah, 'cause she would've shot me already.

821
01:23:18,791 --> 01:23:19,875
Come on. Give me the gun.

822
01:23:31,833 --> 01:23:34,250
Oh, you...

823
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:39,750
You abandon me, and then
you steal my baby from me,

824
01:23:39,833 --> 01:23:41,125
and now you shoot me?

825
01:23:41,208 --> 01:23:42,625
That shit won't work on me.

826
01:23:42,708 --> 01:23:44,416
Not gonna work on me anymore, Phil.

827
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,125
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

828
01:23:48,458 --> 01:23:52,083
And I won't let you hurt my little girl
the way you hurt me.

829
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:13,208
Hannah!

830
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:16,958
Hannah. Hannah.

831
01:24:25,041 --> 01:24:26,166
Do you remember?

832
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:34,916
Do you remember…

833
01:24:37,291 --> 01:24:38,666
How it felt?

834
01:24:45,416 --> 01:24:46,541
Yeah.

835
01:24:46,625 --> 01:24:48,333
I remember.

836
01:25:09,666 --> 01:25:11,416
Vee! We have to run!

837
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:28,916
Vee!

838
01:25:54,416 --> 01:25:55,750
Oh shit.

839
01:25:59,625 --> 01:26:00,708
Vee?

840
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:07,666
Game's over, okay?
Come here, Little Rabbit.

841
01:26:07,750 --> 01:26:10,375
We gotta go right now.

842
01:26:15,958 --> 01:26:17,916
Oh! Oh, baby.

843
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,250
Come on. Get up. Are you okay?

844
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:22,791
Did he hurt you?
He didn't hurt you, right?

845
01:26:22,875 --> 01:26:23,833
Mm-mm.

846
01:26:28,000 --> 01:26:30,666
Oh! Hide. Hide. Hide.

847
01:26:43,416 --> 01:26:44,291
Lou.

848
01:26:45,291 --> 01:26:46,750
- Hannah.
- Come on.

849
01:26:49,791 --> 01:26:51,583
We need to move.

850
01:26:54,166 --> 01:26:55,416
Vee?

851
01:26:58,500 --> 01:27:00,125
- My gun.
- Lost it.

852
01:27:00,750 --> 01:27:03,083
- Knife?
- Stuck in Philip's hand.

853
01:27:08,458 --> 01:27:10,541
Try that hatch. Go, go, now.

854
01:27:18,333 --> 01:27:21,416
- Wait, your jacket's stuck.
- Oh fuck.

855
01:27:22,541 --> 01:27:23,708
Push you up.

856
01:27:28,541 --> 01:27:30,333
Run to the end of the beach.

857
01:27:30,416 --> 01:27:31,708
- Run as fast as you can.
- No!

858
01:27:31,791 --> 01:27:33,291
- I'll meet you there.
- Don't leave me.

859
01:27:33,375 --> 01:27:35,958
We won't fit.
You gotta run now. Go, go, go, go.

860
01:27:36,041 --> 01:27:37,833
Run, Little Rabbit! Run!

861
01:27:38,875 --> 01:27:40,708
It's rigged. I can't defuse it.

862
01:27:40,791 --> 01:27:43,250
Could buy us some time
if I can change the frequency.

863
01:27:43,333 --> 01:27:45,083
Wait. Where are you going?

864
01:27:45,166 --> 01:27:47,291
One of us was actually a Girl Scout.

865
01:28:15,375 --> 01:28:17,500
- Do you still have the radio?
- Yeah.

866
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:20,875
Maybe we can use it after all.
Go bust that gate open.

867
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:25,000
Lou?

868
01:28:26,791 --> 01:28:28,000
We're all here.

869
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:33,250
We're all here.

870
01:28:35,333 --> 01:28:38,666
I was hoping
that we could all do this together.

871
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:45,125
Face to face!

872
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,666
So that we could end this… the right way.

873
01:28:51,750 --> 01:28:53,500
End this right.

874
01:28:56,291 --> 01:28:57,583
As a family.

875
01:29:00,208 --> 01:29:01,250
As a family.

876
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:06,833
But sometimes,
you don't get what you want.

877
01:29:18,833 --> 01:29:19,750
Fuck!

878
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:33,416
Fuck!

879
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:38,375
Fuck!

880
01:29:38,875 --> 01:29:41,208
Fuck! You fuckin' let me in!

881
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:43,458
Oh, thank God.

882
01:29:52,708 --> 01:29:53,833
Oh shit.

883
01:30:00,708 --> 01:30:02,250
- Oh shit.
- What?

884
01:30:02,333 --> 01:30:04,208
The CIA's on the hunt.

885
01:30:04,750 --> 01:30:07,250
They comin' for Philip or you?

886
01:30:08,375 --> 01:30:10,708
They won't want either one of us
to leave here alive.

887
01:30:10,791 --> 01:30:12,333
- Go, go.
- No.

888
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:14,583
- I'll just slow you down.
- I'm not gonna leave you here.

889
01:30:14,666 --> 01:30:17,875
Lou, go get your granddaughter to safety.
I'll catch up.

890
01:30:37,083 --> 01:30:38,166
Fuck!

891
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:41,333
Fuck!

892
01:30:48,750 --> 01:30:49,833
Fuck!

893
01:31:06,916 --> 01:31:07,875
Vee…

894
01:31:08,666 --> 01:31:10,208
Oh! Come here.

895
01:31:12,208 --> 01:31:13,208
Oof!

896
01:31:25,125 --> 01:31:27,416
You're a brave little girl. You know that?

897
01:31:32,000 --> 01:31:33,625
Good. Help me up, will you?

898
01:31:38,416 --> 01:31:42,083
Okay, listen to me.
I want you to go grab a stick, okay?

899
01:31:42,166 --> 01:31:44,250
The longest one you can find. Go, go, go.

900
01:32:18,916 --> 01:32:20,583
- Mommy!
- Hey, baby.

901
01:32:21,166 --> 01:32:23,208
Hannah. The radio.

902
01:32:23,291 --> 01:32:24,375
In my pocket.

903
01:32:25,166 --> 01:32:26,458
- Come on.
- Help me.

904
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,916
- All right.
- Come on, go, run.

905
01:32:29,833 --> 01:32:31,375
Hannah, hold this up as high as you can.

906
01:32:34,125 --> 01:32:36,125
- Are you calling for help?
- Yeah.

907
01:32:43,791 --> 01:32:46,250
Yeah.
That ought to get their attention.

908
01:32:52,541 --> 01:32:55,000
You gotta go.
Take the road back towards town.

909
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:57,875
- Bring Jax with you.
- You… you come with us.

910
01:32:57,958 --> 01:33:00,208
Hannah, you take care of your kid…

911
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:02,500
I'll take care of mine.

912
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:06,208
I left a letter for you at my house.
Make sure you find it.

913
01:33:06,791 --> 01:33:09,000
Okay. Go on, Vee.

914
01:33:10,083 --> 01:33:11,333
Oh, God damn it.

915
01:33:15,833 --> 01:33:17,208
Don't die on me now, Lou.

916
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:22,166
Everything that matters
is right here in front of you.

917
01:33:23,875 --> 01:33:24,750
I know.

918
01:33:26,416 --> 01:33:28,041
Go. Now!

919
01:36:28,375 --> 01:36:29,666
I'm sorry, kid.

920
01:37:38,666 --> 01:37:39,916
- Hey, Vee.
- Hey.

921
01:37:40,541 --> 01:37:41,791
Hello, Jax.

922
01:37:42,458 --> 01:37:44,583
Hey, you got two bracelets now.

923
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:47,750
Yeah. Just like you.

924
01:37:49,916 --> 01:37:51,083
One's for a friend.

925
01:37:51,666 --> 01:37:54,583
So, out of the blue, she just leaves
you and your daughter this house?

926
01:37:54,666 --> 01:37:58,458
Mm-hm. Yeah, this house
and a ton of frozen deer meat.

927
01:37:59,708 --> 01:38:01,083
It's open.

928
01:38:01,583 --> 01:38:03,375
- Hey, Han.
- Hey.

929
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:04,541
Oh, hello.

930
01:38:06,416 --> 01:38:07,666
You guys still around?

931
01:38:07,750 --> 01:38:09,583
We had a few more questions
for Ms. Dawson here.

932
01:38:09,666 --> 01:38:12,291
Oh. I hope I'm not interrupting.

933
01:38:12,375 --> 01:38:16,416
Hannah, uh, coroner's got an issue.

934
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:20,375
You're next of kin. He needs a signature
to release Philip's body for burial.

935
01:38:20,875 --> 01:38:22,583
Yeah. Sorry.

936
01:38:25,583 --> 01:38:27,833
Ms. Dawson, did Lou Adell ever mention

937
01:38:27,916 --> 01:38:31,375
anything about documents
from her time in the CIA to you?

938
01:38:31,458 --> 01:38:33,583
She'd be a pretty shit spy if she did.

939
01:38:36,875 --> 01:38:38,250
If you think of anything…

940
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:42,416
You gave me a card last time
you were here, and the time before that.

941
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:43,708
Anything at all.

942
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:46,541
All right.

943
01:38:51,375 --> 01:38:53,416
- Sheriff.
- Good to see you again.

944
01:39:01,166 --> 01:39:02,625
- Forget them.
- Mm.

945
01:39:02,708 --> 01:39:04,875
Looks like you two are ready for Seattle.

946
01:39:04,958 --> 01:39:06,500
Yeah, you're all packed up.

947
01:39:07,041 --> 01:39:08,333
Yeah, almost.

948
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:11,625
I wanted to tell you, you just did
a beautiful job with the memorial service.

949
01:39:11,708 --> 01:39:12,541
- Stop.
- No, you did.

950
01:39:12,625 --> 01:39:14,625
And I think Lou would have
really appreciated it.

951
01:39:14,708 --> 01:39:18,916
Come on now. All that sincere
emotion would have made her puke.

952
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:20,583
Yeah!

953
01:39:21,875 --> 01:39:23,166
Oh, well…

954
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:27,791
- She was her own person.
- Mm-hm.

955
01:39:27,875 --> 01:39:31,666
I mean, sometimes,
I'm just so damn mad at her, and then…

956
01:39:33,166 --> 01:39:35,458
Other times I miss her.

957
01:39:36,666 --> 01:39:38,916
Isn't that just how it is with family?

958
01:39:45,625 --> 01:39:49,416
<i>"I've never been one for many words,
so I'll keep this short."</i>

959
01:39:53,125 --> 01:39:55,500
<i>"The house is yours. Sell it."</i>

960
01:39:56,333 --> 01:40:00,291
<i>"There's a month's worth of meat for Jax
in the freezer, and some cash for you."</i>

961
01:40:04,833 --> 01:40:07,125
<i>"Life doesn't give you second chances,</i>

962
