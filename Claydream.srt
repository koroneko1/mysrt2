characters often have a simple

22
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:21,149
goal and a simple purpose,

23
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:23,451
but it's in
great conflict with

24

either the world around

25
00:01:27,155 --> 00:01:31,492

makes the character or the

There were extraordinarily

question -- led by Phil Knight,

-Yeah.

45
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,777
-It still remains to me stunning
really that the founder of the

46
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:28,716
company could basically ignore
the interests of shareholders

47
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,952
other than Will Vinton or
myself -- the employees,

48
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:35,223
the creditors -- ignore all
their interests and put this

00:02:35,223 --> 00:02:37,458
company on the
threshold of bankruptcy

50
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,227

51
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,028
-[Vinton] No,
that's not correct.

52
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:45,466
It's definitely,
absolutely the other way around.

64
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:16,857
I never really had much
interest in film production

65
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,827
until I actually went to
college and became very,

66
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,162
very interested in it.

67
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:26,700
My sister, who was in Berkeley,
strongly encouraged me to be a

68
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:30,504
part of this scene that
was Berkeley in the '60s.

69
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:34,608
There was just so much going on.

*psychedelic rock

71
00:04:44,552 --> 00:04:46,687
The whole Claymation
thing really evolved

72
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,523
out of studying architecture.

73
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,727
I was very fascinated with
Antoni GaudÃ­ who had done

74
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:57,798
extraordinarily organic
shapes in architecture,

75
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,734
things that had to be sculpted.

76
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:04,204
And that got me messing
with plasticine clay,

77
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:07,708
and the filmmaking and the
clay got together and-- for some

78
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,110
early experiments.

79
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:13,947
My father used to shoot
16mm film as home movie.

80
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:16,984
I asked him if I
could use his camera,

81
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,388
so I got this great little
filmmaker kit and kind of

82
00:05:20,421 --> 00:05:23,757
instantly became a filmmaker.

83
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,259
My father was really
hoping I would be,

84
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,796
you know, a corporate
executive or something,

85
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,065
but he also really encouraged me
to explore and try things and,

86
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,634
you know, give it a go.

87
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,469
And if you believe in
something strong enough,

88
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:37,971
you'll find a way
to make it happen.

89
00:05:38,906 --> 00:05:41,174
So first thing I started doing
is shooting a lot of stuff on

90
00:05:41,241 --> 00:05:42,610
the Berkeley campus.

91
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:45,178
This is the '60s; things
were getting pretty wacky.

*rock music

93
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:03,431
I was really fascinated
by what cameras could do,

94
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:06,033
and, in particular, stop motion.

95
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,702
You know, setting a camera on a
tripod and shooting one frame at

96
00:06:08,736 --> 00:06:12,072
a time, making things move.

97
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,942
And animating human bodies.

98
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:16,744
You know, sort of looked
at this stuff and I said,

99
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:19,680
"Whoa, that's pretty cool!"

100
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:23,016
I learned really
quickly how you cut,

101
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:26,754
how you focus an
audience's attention,

102
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:30,624
the language of film
and the power of film.

103
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:34,294
I wasn't a storyteller, but I
saw the power of storytelling.

104
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,367
[clap]

105
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:43,871
There was a very active
film community in Berkeley --

106
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:45,873
filmmakers, people
that did various kinds

107
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,575
of experimental films.

108
00:06:47,608 --> 00:06:50,043
*funky ambient music

109
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,080
I organized evenings where I'd
stick an animation camera on the

110
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,283
table, give everybody
a beer in one hand,

111
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,619
blob of clay in the other,
you know, getting a little

112
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:02,389
inebriated...
taking a puff, as well.

113
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,893
And, of course, most
of this stuff became

114
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,327
a little pornographic.

115
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,530

That was the beginning
of claymation for me.

118
00:07:14,635 --> 00:07:19,406
It was a real
epiphany to see these very,

119
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:24,512
very crude things
happening on this tabletop,

120
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,850
to see these characters evolve
in this incredibly simple and

121
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,985
non-planned sort of way.

124
00:07:37,925 --> 00:07:41,862
What I was most amazed
about was how this completely

125
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:46,900
inanimate wad of clay could
move and be imbued with life.

*dreamy music

129
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:06,554
When I first saw this stuff, it
really made an impression on me.

130
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,757
And I felt -- even then -- that
if I could marry the magic that

131
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:13,561
I saw with really
solid film skills,

132
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,428
I could be really powerful.

-[Will VO] In order to do
the kind of experimenting that I

136
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:30,878
wanted to do, taking
it to the next level,

137
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:34,447
I really kind of
needed a little studio.

138
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,384
And actually managed to buy
a small house in Portland,

139
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,021
and it ended up being my
future animation studio.

140
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,192
Well, for several years while
making live-action and a few cel

141
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:48,896
animated films, I was working on
a technique of clay animation.

142
00:08:48,962 --> 00:08:51,398
It was a technique that Bob
Gardiner-- a sculptor -- and I

143
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,000
worked on during college.

144
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,203
*mellow ambient music

145
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,672
Bob was crazy,
wonderful artist

146
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:01,274
-- really out
there -- and just

147
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:05,613
a kind of a wild energy
that was intoxicating,

148
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:09,449
and classic artist
with a capital A.

149
00:09:09,482 --> 00:09:12,452
I happened to know that he
would be -- and was -- not

150
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:14,421
doing anything.

151
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:18,325
"Say, why don't you come on
up, and let's make a film?"

152
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:22,663
So Bob came up and lived at my
place and ended up living there

153
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:25,633
for like a year
and a half, [laughs]

154
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:28,769
much to my
wife's chagrin.

155
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:32,472
Because Bob's lifestyle is
loose with various psychedelics,

156
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:34,407
which I was dabbling
in at the time too,

157
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,843
but not as intensely.

158
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,510
[laughs]

159
00:09:37,645 --> 00:09:40,748
But I always liked working
with really good artists.

160
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:45,085
Bob was absolutely
one of those people,

161
00:09:45,118 --> 00:09:49,923
in the sense that he was
intensely on another plane.

162
00:09:49,957 --> 00:09:52,926
-[Bill VO] Bob
was a really charming guy.

163
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,663
He was a mad genius.

164
00:09:55,663 --> 00:09:57,665
Together they were
the perfect team.

165
00:09:57,698 --> 00:10:02,269

with the organized producer.

167
00:10:06,306 --> 00:10:09,142
-[Will VO] We spent a
lot of time in that basement

168
00:10:09,176 --> 00:10:11,812
experimenting with clay...

169
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:16,850
metamorphosis,
lip-sync, cutting techniques.

170
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,787
Clay animation had
been around forever.

00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:21,288
People ask if we invented it.

172
00:10:21,321 --> 00:10:24,792
No, but what we did was brought
it to the forefront by doing a

173
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:27,560
lot of experimenting.

174
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:31,865
*contemplative music

175
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,201
I decided to do a little short
short film that really showed

176
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,970
off some of these techniques.

[man grunting]

180
00:10:43,076 --> 00:10:45,746
We had trouble keeping the
characters very stable and

181
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:50,583
steady, and so we tended to make
the characters all be winos so

182
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,385
they could stumble around.

183
00:10:52,419 --> 00:10:56,089

-[Will VO] We were real
excited about getting it done in

192
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:21,414
time for this local film
festival here in Portland,

193
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,951
and it was rejected.

194
00:11:23,984 --> 00:11:26,019
We were just devastated.

195
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,589
It was a sad time,
but never stops me.

196
00:11:29,622 --> 00:11:33,493
So I made as many prints as I
could afford and started sending

197
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,196
it around to film festivals.

198
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:39,332
And suddenly we started
getting amazing response.

199
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:42,770
Top prize at major,
big-time festivals,

200
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:45,638
and it got nominated
for an Academy Award.

201
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:49,209
-The winner is 'Closed Mondays,'
Will Vinton and Bob Gardiner.

and uh, Will.

206
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,689
Thank you very much.

207
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:07,460
-Thanks members of the
Academy for an incredible honor.

208
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:11,131
And hello and thank you to all
our friends back home in Oregon.

00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,136
-[Will VO] After the
win, we were partying at the

211
00:12:16,203 --> 00:12:17,805
Governor's Ball.

212
00:12:17,871 --> 00:12:22,542
Bob's mother came up to him
with quite a serious face,

213
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:26,046
and she said this
was too much too soon,

214
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,382
and this is the kiss of death.

215
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:33,086
It made me really concerned
about what ultimately happens

216
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,823
with Bob.

217
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,591
Winning an Oscar was huge.

218
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,960
Seemed to me kind
of an opportunity

219
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:42,830
to explore things further.

220
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:46,266
I was just itching
to do more projects.

221
00:12:46,299 --> 00:12:49,903
But for Bob, winning the Academy
Award was such a heady thing.

222
00:12:49,937 --> 00:12:51,839
[pop, horn blows]

223
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:56,910
He was off doing all
sorts of crazy things.

224
00:12:56,977 --> 00:13:01,481
Bob would walk around town
with his Oscar in his pocket and

225
00:13:01,514 --> 00:13:04,885
stick it up on a bar and
see who'd buy him drinks.

226
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:09,522
That was the way he saw what he
was gonna do with this Oscar.

227
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:13,693
It got to be so hard that
I couldn't count on him.

228
00:13:14,061 --> 00:13:17,230
It was just such a
clash of working styles.

229
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,067
We felt it was good to do our
own things and then help each

230
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,402
other out.

231
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,672
-[Bill VO] Bob set up
his own little studio and he got

232
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,942
a commission from
Rolling Stone to do a TV show.

*rock music

234
00:13:32,712 --> 00:13:35,215
I got to visit his studio
and see what he was doing,

235
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,917
and I was really impressed.

236
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:41,421
So he did get work
after he left Vinton,

237
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,091
but he wasn't a good businessman
and he couldn't follow through

238
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,592
on it.

239
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:49,963
I think he was bipolar, so
unfortunately he descended into

240
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:55,035
this drunken stupor, and he
would rail at Vinton and claim

241
00:13:55,702 --> 00:14:00,707
that he was really the artistic
genius behind 'Closed Mondays,'

242
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:05,678
that he developed the Claymation
technique and that Vinton never

243
00:14:05,712 --> 00:14:08,181
gave him credit.

244
00:14:08,215 --> 00:14:12,385
Will and him separated, but Will
filled the vacuum left by Bob

245
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:16,223
with really great animators.

246
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:18,825

I did after that was Will

247
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:22,062

-That was the
beginning of this wonderful,

256
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,944
delightful
collaborative kind of phase

257
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:39,212
where the goal was to try
to find some way we could

258
00:14:39,246 --> 00:14:43,316
push the Claymation
into some new areas.

259
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,985
-[Bill VO] He had
this little studio that was

260
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:47,254
behind a barbershop.

261
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,958
Walk past the barbershop and up
these steps and into this secret

262
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,961
domain, and suddenly
there's an animation studio.

263
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:58,498
And so it was like going
into a James Bond movie.

264

[high-pitched swirling noises]

265
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:02,735
It was like magic.

You would not believe
what it felt like to walk

267
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:06,339
through that place.

[bike bell rings]

269
00:15:08,008 --> 00:15:11,011
-[Melissa VO] The
studio was like the mother-ship.

270
00:15:11,078 --> 00:15:13,446
I remember clearly
one day thinking,

271
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,984
"We're all gonna end up being
old together and having an old

272
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:19,486
persons' home-- retirement home.

273
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,254
We're all gonna
be living together."

274
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:23,023
Because it all felt very close.

00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,793
-When you walk
away, you track it out.

277
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:28,295
-[Chuck VO] It
was very hippie-like.

278
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,429
-Can you smell that?

279
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:30,697
-[Chuck VO] A sort of commune.

280
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,199
-Huh?

281
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,134
You got some of it, don't you?

282
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:36,003
-[Chuck VO] I
have my actual contract.

283
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,371
It doesn't even have
my real name on it.

284
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:39,639
It was for fun.

285
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,641
There was nothing
legal about it.

286
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:43,010
It was just like, "Hey
you wanna work here?

287
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,011
Okay, well what's your name?

288
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:46,346
I'll just make one up."

289
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:49,316
The word
"corporate" didn't exist.

290
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:52,185
It just didn't
feel like a business.

291
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,288
It felt like art
school plus vacation.

-[Will VO] We weren't a
very sophisticated business.

We were a collective of

so melodic and forward-moving.

I felt like I was working

something really wonderful
that was gonna endure for a

299
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:20,447
very long time.

00:16:42,935 --> 00:16:45,105
partly because they are.

307
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:47,807
-[woman VO] In fact, the
entire production is shot and

this one that we didn't learn

can we take forward into the

I hardly even remember
thinking about making money.

The thinking was always about
what we could do to make the

projects as cool as
they could possibly be.

[water bubbles]

324
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:57,377
We did so many things as
creatively as we did by virtue

325
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,811
of the fact that we
were doing them very,

326
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:01,981
very inexpensively.

-[Will VO] We
all charged ahead,

351
00:19:12,285 --> 00:19:14,754
expanding it and trying to grow
it and move it in whatever ways

352
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:16,623
we possibly could.

00:19:24,264 --> 00:19:26,799
-Will loved the fact that he
didn't have to be in Los Angeles

357
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,669
to do this kind of
work and to get noticed.

358
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:32,038
-[man VO] Has there ever been a
temptation for you to move from

359
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,107
Portland to Hollywood where
all the big film business is?

360
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:40,146
-Well, in all honesty there's
some small amount of temptation.

361
00:19:40,247 --> 00:19:41,348
-[Craig VO]
Here you are in Portland,

362
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,816
which is hardly a film center.

363
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,952
Lifestyle mattered
more than money, and

364
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,455
what people did on the
weekends mattered more than

365
00:19:48,488 --> 00:19:49,656
their jobs.

366
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,891
-What I can surmise from
what you're positing is like,

367
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:54,060
Portland's almost an
alternative universe.

368
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:55,528
It's almost like
cars don't exist, right?

369
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,496
-Yes!

370
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,464
-You can ride bikes,
or double decker bikes.

371
00:19:57,497 --> 00:19:59,466
They ride unicycles,
they ride the tram,

372
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:00,467
they ride skateboards.

373
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,701
-Exactly!

374
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:04,304
-'Portlandia' is almost like
a documentary as far as I'm

375
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:08,975
concerned in terms of
showing how eccentric and unique

376
00:20:09,008 --> 00:20:12,479
Portland is, and how much
everything's kind of a one-off.

377
00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:15,081
Will's Claymation
studio's like that too.

378
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,217
Nobody else is doing
anything like this.

379
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:21,321
He wanted to do his own
thing, he created it,

380
00:20:21,354 --> 00:20:23,856
and he gave us all these jobs.

381
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:27,226
The best stop-motion animators
from around the world all

382
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:30,830
gravitated to the
famous Will Vinton Studio.

383
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:32,699
-[Will VO] I'm really
committed to working here,

384
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:35,835
and there's really no reason
that you have to produce a film

385
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:39,105
in Hollywood.

386
00:20:39,406 --> 00:20:41,541
*mellow ambient music*

387
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,877
-Will the entrepreneur -- Will
the guy who started something

388
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:48,781
from nothing and did it just
because he wanted to -- if

389
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:51,884
you're gonna be an entrepreneur,
you're gonna start a company,

390
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:53,853
you're gonna be the man.

391
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,022
-The first time I
really met Will,

392
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:59,626
the two words that came
to mind were "white heat,"

393
00:20:59,692 --> 00:21:02,495
a burning ambition
to make a brand,

394
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:03,996
to make a name.

395
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:08,935
He just wanted to conquer.

396
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:11,804
-[Jeffrey VO] A good
decade before Will got started,

397
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:15,975
there was another eclectic
long-shot small business here

398
00:21:16,008 --> 00:21:17,644
in Oregon.

399
00:21:17,677 --> 00:21:21,180
It was a guy selling
shoes, and it was Phil Knight,

400
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:22,849
and that company became Nike.

401
00:21:22,882 --> 00:21:24,116
-Oh sweat!
Oh sweat!

402
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,485
Oh sweat, it's Nike!

403
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,853
You gotta hook me up!

404
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,555
*hip hop beat

405
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,790
-[Jeffrey VO] It
absolutely came to dominate.

406

***

407
00:21:36,363 --> 00:21:39,466
It became this
world-eating company.

408
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:44,371
And there's an interesting
parallel between Phil and Will;

409
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:47,474
they pioneered an
industry and they stuck with it,

410
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:51,077
and against all odds they
built something pretty special.

411
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:56,148
And then they sort of came
together and disasters result.

412
00:21:56,683 --> 00:21:58,385
-[woman] Mr. Knight,
please raise your right hand.

413
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,420
Do you solemnly swear that this
testimony will be the truth,

414
00:22:00,487 --> 00:22:01,421
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth,

415
00:22:01,454 --> 00:22:02,455
so help you God?

416
00:22:02,489 --> 00:22:03,890
-I do.
-[woman] Thank you.

417
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,626
-Mr. Knight, would you explain
what first interested you in

418
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,429
investing in Will
Vinton Studios?

419
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:12,565
-Wil Vinton had approached me
in the spring of '98 about the

420
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14,967
possibility of investing
in Will Vinton Studios,

421
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:17,136
and I was intrigued.

422
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,838
-And what intrigued you?

423
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:20,907
-Well, first of all, profitable.

424
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,842
They had been in
existence a long time,

425
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,677
they had won an
Academy Award, and

426
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:28,280
they'd had considerable artistic
success in the creative field,

427
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:30,817
and I was interested in that.

428
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:35,488
-Was there any intent to do
future Will Vinton Studios

429
00:22:35,522 --> 00:22:38,925
animation outside of Portland?

430
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:43,963
-What do future plans outside
of Portland have to do with any

431
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,098
subject matter of this lawsuit?

432
00:22:46,132 --> 00:22:49,135
-Well I have a theory, but
I don't need to go into it.

you characterize

435

your level of frustration

436
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,751
over Will Vinton?

you're married but you also

work together.

444
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:25,472
I would think that it would
be hard to separate the two.

445
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,473
-[Vinton] It is.

446
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,074
-And we really live
two separate lives.

When we were working really
intensely on something -- I

448
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:33,145
should point out the 'Rip Van
Winkle' script got started on

449

[laughter]

451

was a deadline [laughing]

452
00:23:38,651 --> 00:23:40,487
and things like that. [laughs]

-- one of the most focused

people I've ever met --

456
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53,065
but if his focus shifts,

457
00:23:53,099 --> 00:23:56,636
he really is able to kind of cut
the traces of what came before,

458
00:23:56,669 --> 00:23:58,304
totally cut them.

get kind of easy or a little

kind of somewhere else.

462
00:24:09,582 --> 00:24:11,150
-[Susan VO] I mean,
all the times I knew him,

463
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,353
I don't remember us ever having
to wrestle with his conscience.

464
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,088
It is, "This is
what's being done.

465
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,824
This is what I'm doing."

466
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:20,326

him waver on that.

He had a wife prior to me.

470

He left her in
exactly the same way.

00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,908
12 years...

472
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,279

He's a very complex man.

476
00:24:50,356 --> 00:24:53,926

express himself was in his work.

facets of himself.

And yet he was also
a very private man.

483

There's a lot of people, maybe
most of the people who know Will

484
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:20,152
who might say, "I never
really quite knew him.

I could never
quite figure him out."

486
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:28,027

a character with a dream,

with a character flaw, and
with a kind of a sadness.

-[Will VO] The pressure on
this first creative phase is

that we wanted to keep
the bar extremely high,

500
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,109
and we wanted to
do feature films.

501

and bigger and pretty soon he's

502

having what he wants -- which
he always told me was to be the

it looked as if maybe that

504

young Will Vinton Studios
and Walt Disney Studios.

508
00:26:38,665 --> 00:26:42,268
Each success followed by a
way to follow up on that in a

509
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:45,504
commercial way, and
then if you can do that,

510
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,474
you can experiment and
make 'Fantasia' or build

511
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:49,776
a Disneyland.

512
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:53,479
Will had it.
He was actually doing it.

513
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,480
He won his Oscar.

514
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:55,882

which was 'The Adventures of

saw in some of the short films

00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,572
that came before it.

00:27:20,606 --> 00:27:23,442
-[Craig VO] Clay

525
00:27:25,077 --> 00:27:28,414
metamorphosis from
'The Great Cognito...'

526
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,953
special effects that we used in
things like 'The Little Prince.'

527
00:27:34,821 --> 00:27:36,055
There's nothing like it.

528
00:27:36,088 --> 00:27:38,590
There's nothing
even remotely like it.

529
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:42,061
Will wanted this to feel like
you were in his clay world.

530
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:45,965
Furniture was made out of
clay, the walls were clay,

531
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,735
the pictures on
the wall were clay.

532
00:27:48,735 --> 00:27:51,403
-It is a landmark achievement
in the motion picture field,

533
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:54,506
and that is because it is the
first clay-animated feature

534
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:57,143
movie ever made.

535
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:59,611
-[Melissa VO] A lot
was riding on 'The Adventures

536
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:02,014
of Mark Twain.'

537
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:06,352
It was in production over five
years with a small crew toiling

538
00:28:06,385 --> 00:28:09,889
over this very tedious
process of making this movie.

539
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:12,224
-The basic
philosophy has not changed.

540
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:14,426
Vinton and his staff hope
to continue to be a form of

541
00:28:14,493 --> 00:28:16,996
entertainment
primarily for adults.

542
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:19,832
You'll never see Will Vinton's
name on the kind of things that

543
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:23,335
you're seeing now on
Saturday morning TV.

544
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:28,007
-[Melissa VO] Will felt
that this is a sophisticated

545
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,677
film that should
appeal to adults.

546
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:35,614
And it just didn't get
marketed in that way.

547
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:37,683
-The interesting
thing is the movie,

548
00:28:37,784 --> 00:28:40,920
it's kind of a dark story, and
there were warning labels on

549
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:43,689
those cassettes that say, "This
may not be suitable for your

550
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:46,558
child," which was the kiss
of death if you're trying to

551
00:28:46,592 --> 00:28:48,194
release a children's movie.

552
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:51,397
*melancholy ambient music

553
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:54,967
-[Melissa VO] 'Mark Twain' had
a really disappointing premiere.

554
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:58,871
People would
take their children,

555
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:01,941
or they didn't always
get the next level of

556
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:05,812
humor or sophistication.

557
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:08,380
-[voice on speaker] Welcome
to the mysterious stranger.

558
00:29:08,447 --> 00:29:11,683
[children whispering]

559
00:29:11,717 --> 00:29:13,152
-Hello.

560
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,653
-Who are you?

561
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:15,888
-Satan.

562
00:29:15,955 --> 00:29:18,124
-Uh oh.

563
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:19,826
-[Will VO] Well, there's
no question I was hoping

564
00:29:19,826 --> 00:29:22,862
'Mark Twain' would be
the beginning of doing more

565
00:29:22,895 --> 00:29:24,831
feature projects.

566
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,699
***

567
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:31,737
I think above all I was
disappointed with what happens

568
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:36,008
in the world of distribution.

569
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:39,846
-That was a real sad thing that
nobody seemed to know what to do

570
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:42,915
with this magical stuff.

571
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:47,019
He had a capacity to put things
in a place where they wouldn't

572
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:51,991
interfere or slow him down, but
in his private place with just

573
00:29:52,024 --> 00:29:55,895
himself, he and him,
it hurt him very much.

574
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,669
-I did a bit of soul searching
and thought about how the

575
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:08,574
creative process works, and I've
come up with what I think is my

576
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:11,377
most creative project to date,
which I would like to introduce

577
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,213
to you at this time.

578
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,283
[applause]

579
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,618
This is Billy.

580
00:30:19,685 --> 00:30:21,520
Say hello!
[chuckles]

581
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,123
Let's look at the creative
process and how it works.

582
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:26,926
[audience laughter]

583
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,861
It all starts with an idea.

584
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:31,630
Perhaps nothing more
than a twinkle in your eye.

585
00:30:31,697 --> 00:30:34,200
And in time, with a
little give and take,

586
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:38,237
assuming the idea
finds fertile ground,

587
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:41,807
it may soon be fully conceived.

588
00:30:41,874 --> 00:30:43,409
But you still don't
know what you've got.

589
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:45,377
[audience laughter]

590
00:30:45,411 --> 00:30:47,446
As the concept goes
into a gestation period,

591
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:49,481
it grows and it modifies.

592
00:30:49,548 --> 00:30:52,384
Finally, the project is
fully realized with a tremendous

593
00:30:52,418 --> 00:30:53,819
amount of effort.

594
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:54,954
And is released-- [Billy coos]

595
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,488
Yeah.
[audience laughter]

596
00:30:56,555 --> 00:30:58,790
And is
released for all to see.

597
00:30:58,824 --> 00:31:00,792
To the creators it's
hard to be objective,

598
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:04,196
and it often looks pretty
bad when it first comes out.

599
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:07,666
But at that point, one can't
help but sort of feel like

600
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:11,938
you're-- question what it is
you've really done as a creator,

601
00:31:11,938 --> 00:31:16,175
and before long a strong sense
of pride generally results to

602
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,245
the point where you may
even consider doing it again.

603
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:22,581
[laughter]

604
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:23,950
We have Mummy.

-[laughs]

606
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:29,221
-[Will] And Billy.

607
00:31:29,588 --> 00:31:31,190
-Let me stand up and
show how pregnant.

608
00:31:31,223 --> 00:31:32,258
-[Will] Very pregnant.

609
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:34,360
There it is.

610
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:35,561
That's Jesse.

611
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,029
-Yeah, this is Jesse.

612
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:40,232
Oh my God, there they go!

613
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,433
-[Jesse VO] He was
always interested in looking

614
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:44,003
for projects that
we could do with him.

615
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:45,871
Even though he wasn't the kind
of person that would really say

616
00:31:45,972 --> 00:31:48,707
a lot of "I love yous"

617
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,410
or really kind of
show affection...

618
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:53,545
[drumming]

619
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:56,082
You know, he had his own way
of constantly showing us that he

620
00:31:56,115 --> 00:31:57,549
loved us.

*mellow ambient music

622
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:02,821
The best times that we
had with one another,

623
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:05,992
we were actively trying
to accomplish a goal,

624
00:32:05,992 --> 00:32:08,995
making something,
creating something.

625
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:12,531
Going to cut down
a Christmas tree,

626
00:32:12,598 --> 00:32:15,334
we would literally hack
down like a 20-foot tree,

627
00:32:15,367 --> 00:32:18,137
and we'd bring it home.

628
00:32:19,371 --> 00:32:22,308
Billy and I were six and eight
years old and we were like up on

629
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:25,544
the balcony with like a
rope-pulley system that my dad

630
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:28,014
had like showed us how to
like rig on the top of the tree,

631
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:30,882
and he's down below trying
to like push the tree up.

632
00:32:32,018 --> 00:32:33,285
-[woman] There's Will.

633
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:35,554
-[man] There's Will.

634
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:37,023
-[woman] The man
with the camera,

635
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:40,359
and now we're moving in on him,
because-- Billy don't pull on

636
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,394
the camera!

637
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:44,330
-[woman] Get a close-up of him
so that we know that Daddy was

638
00:32:44,363 --> 00:32:45,864
here too.

639
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:47,199
-[Jesse VO] Things
were really taking off for the

640
00:32:47,233 --> 00:32:50,169
studio, and it
was growing rapidly.

641
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:53,239
He spent an enormous
amount of time at the studio,

642
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:56,675
and maybe prioritized
that over family a little bit.

643
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,045
I think that's
what he had to do.

644
00:32:59,045 --> 00:33:02,414

645
00:33:02,748 --> 00:33:05,151
-Oh, look at the...

646
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:06,618
-[Melissa VO]
After 'Mark Twain' had a really

647
00:33:06,652 --> 00:33:09,221
disappointing premiere,
we were all depressed.

648
00:33:09,255 --> 00:33:10,922
Will came back,
and was like, "Well,

649
00:33:10,956 --> 00:33:14,593
let's get to
work," like undaunted.

650
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:16,562
[claps]

651
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:20,166
-"Okay, let's get rolling," and
he would say that without fail.

652
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:22,301
And so that's just the kind
of guy he was -- it was like,

653
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:25,571
[clap] "Okay,
let's get rolling."

654
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:28,640
-[Hal VO] I've never seen
him exhibit frustration or anger

655
00:33:28,674 --> 00:33:31,577
or being down.

656
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,248
So it is hard to sort of see him
as a fully rounded human being,

657
00:33:36,282 --> 00:33:39,151
because he's always
got that outward-facing,

658
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:41,320
optimistic demeanor.

659
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,090
You wonder, "What
are the secret doubts?"

*anxious ambient music

661
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:51,997
-[Will VO] My parents
were always just so supportive

662
00:33:52,098 --> 00:33:55,167
of trying things,
of experimenting.

663
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:58,137
What they would say,
"Yeah okay, what's next?"

664
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:01,273
And I'm like that
myself, like, "That was cool.

665
00:34:01,307 --> 00:34:03,542
That was really fun.
Okay, let's see what's next."

666
00:34:03,575 --> 00:34:06,545
[laughs]
Kind of look around.

667
00:34:06,578 --> 00:34:10,216
The California Raisin Advisory
Board came to us with the idea

668
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:14,186
of personifying
raisins that moved to

669
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:16,688
"I Heard It
Through the Grapevine."

670
00:34:16,722 --> 00:34:21,127
*Ooh, I heard it
through the grapevine*

671
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:25,631
*Raised in the
California sunshine*

672
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:28,700
-I was the director on the
first California Raisins spot,

673
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:32,138
and I thought, "Man,
what a dorky commercial.

674
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:34,140
Nobody's ever gonna
see this commercial.

675
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:36,442
I'm wasting my time."

676
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:39,711
-[Will VO] A tiny, tiny
little advertising campaign

677
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:41,980
just took off.

678
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:45,451
It went viral in an era
where "viral" didn't exist yet.

679
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:49,155
-It seems almost everyone is
wild about these raisins and

680
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:51,157
their hip sales pitch.

681
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:54,160
-[Will VO] The fact that
it's taken the nation by storm

682
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:56,162
is kind of quite a surprise.

683
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:58,597
-[man VO] Raisins are more
popular with youngsters than old

684
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,466
favorites like Charlie Brown.

685
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:03,001
A true advertising phenomenon.

has gone raisin crazy.

in a way that it
never had been before.

692
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:21,520
I can't tell you how
many times people said,

693
00:35:21,553 --> 00:35:24,690
"Wow, what's it like to
be an overnight success?"

694
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:25,524
-[woman VO] Well,
we've all heard of

695
00:35:25,557 --> 00:35:27,493
the overnight sensation--

696
00:35:27,526 --> 00:35:29,828
-And I'm going, "Yeah,
after 15 years of doing this."

697
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:30,862
You know?

698
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:33,031
-Will Vinton is an
Academy Award winner,

699
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:35,601
but hardly anybody knew
his name until he made a

700
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:37,569
television commercial.

701
00:35:37,603 --> 00:35:40,372
-[Will VO] To me,
commercials were little films,

702
00:35:40,406 --> 00:35:45,411
using characters to
really connect with audiences.

703
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:48,447
-We have a hit now, and it's
opening up all these new doors

704
00:35:48,514 --> 00:35:51,783
for us, and we're a busy studio.

705
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,552
[squeaky laughter]

706
00:35:53,585 --> 00:35:56,422
-[man VO] Meet the Noid...

707
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:59,891
the star of Domino's
Pizza commercials.

708
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:03,995
-The Noid happened the same time
the California Raisins happened

709
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:05,631
and just blew up.

710
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:07,333
They were huge.

711
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:10,336
But we won an award for
being the stupidest ad campaign.

712
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:12,037
I don't get it.
He hates pizza?

713
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:14,873
He loves pizza?
He wrecks pizza?

714
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,642
So why should I get Domino's?

715
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,377
[zapping]

716
00:36:18,444 --> 00:36:22,113
[grunting]

717
00:36:22,147 --> 00:36:23,715
-[man] Does it sell pizzas?
-Oh, absolutely.

718
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:24,950
Like crazy.

719
00:36:24,983 --> 00:36:27,353
-[Melissa VO] People
became aware of this process of

720
00:36:27,386 --> 00:36:30,021
Claymation, and they
wanted to be part of it.

721
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:33,525
-[man VO] Nike
makes aerobic shoes...

722
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,461
tennis shoes...

723
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,796
-[Will VO] There
was a lot of capital.

724
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,865
One of the accountants said,
"What are you guys doing over

725
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:42,501
there?
You printing money?"

726
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:47,506
He was so surprised at
the level of profitability.

727
00:36:47,539 --> 00:36:51,510
My father finally [laughing]
stopped wondering when I was

728
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,712
gonna get a real job. [laughs]

729
00:36:53,745 --> 00:36:56,282
And he said that to me.

730
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:59,651
-I'd like to thank
our family and friends...

731
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:01,853
and Will.

732
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:05,724
-Bob Gardiner saw that Will
moving forward with their idea

733
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:08,794
and creating a company
that didn't include him,

734
00:37:08,827 --> 00:37:13,064
he felt that he had been
slighted or robbed of something.

735
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,501
-[Susan VO] Everybody
knew Bob was kind of crazy.

736
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,671
Crazy Bob, funny crazy Bob, who
wasn't so funny after a while.

737
00:37:19,738 --> 00:37:21,907
-[David VO] His activity
would flare up whenever the

738
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,075
studio was
getting a lot of press.

739
00:37:24,109 --> 00:37:26,011
It seemed to agitate him.

740
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:27,746
-"Claymation" -- you
coined the phrase?

741
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,748
-Yeah, right.
-[Barbara] It's just clay--

742
00:37:29,781 --> 00:37:32,117
-It comes from "clay animation."

743
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,419
-[David VO] You'd
come to work in the morning,

744
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:37,489
and there'd be graffiti on the
wall outside that was clearly a

745
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:39,458
message from Bob.

746
00:37:39,491 --> 00:37:41,527
-[Susan VO]
He wrote "Swill Vinton,

747
00:37:41,593 --> 00:37:44,996
Mediocre Crap" like in
five-foot high letters.

748
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,434
-[David VO] He would
call Vinton up in the middle of

749
00:37:48,467 --> 00:37:52,338
the night, yell at
him, and threaten him.

750
00:37:53,705 --> 00:37:56,342
-Hello?

751
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,143
-[Melissa VO]
There would be death threats--

752
00:37:58,176 --> 00:37:59,645
-Yes, uh huh.

753
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:03,582
-[Melissal VO] And the studio
had to take those seriously.

754
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,850
Will carried a gun.

755
00:38:04,883 --> 00:38:07,719
-Okay, yeah.

756
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:12,791
-My name is Nicolle
Gardiner-Sampson,

757
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:16,528
and Bob Gardiner was my father.

758
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:19,731
I probably won't ever
meet anybody like my dad.

759
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:24,536
If you approached him, he would
often have a story to tell,

760
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,038
or he'd play the piano for you.

761
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,376
He would draw with you
and doodle with you.

762
00:38:30,942 --> 00:38:32,811
Nothing was ever typical.

763
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,780
It was magical.

764
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:38,550
I knew that Bob and
Will had a falling out since

765
00:38:38,584 --> 00:38:40,419
I was a little girl.

766
00:38:40,452 --> 00:38:44,155
I think it was always a
ghost that haunted him,

767
00:38:44,222 --> 00:38:47,393
and he struggled letting go.

768
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:52,063
*moody music

769
00:38:52,097 --> 00:38:56,502
-By the way, is Mr. Gardiner
the one who is the true creator

770
00:38:56,568 --> 00:38:59,070
of Claymation?

771
00:39:00,138 --> 00:39:02,408
-Um, why would you ask that?

772
00:39:02,474 --> 00:39:04,710
-I don't want to
hear, "Why would I?"

773
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:08,914
because your complaint alleges
that you are widely recognized

774
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,684
as a creative genius and
the developer of Claymation.

775
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,720
Answer the question.

776
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:16,888
-Mr. Gardiner, absolutely not.

777
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:19,491
-[man] Did you develop it
jointly with Mr. Gardiner?

778
00:39:19,525 --> 00:39:20,992
-Absolutely not.

779
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:25,564
Claymation was developed,
five or-- several years after I

780
00:39:25,597 --> 00:39:30,602
worked with Bob
Gardiner-- coined.

781
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:32,571
-See, that wasn't hard.

782
00:39:32,604 --> 00:39:35,741
***

783
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:42,848
-[David VO] Bob was
an incredibly creative artist,

784
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:46,251
somewhat mad,
somewhat delusional.

785
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:49,555
He was good with inspired ideas,
but he couldn't execute on them.

786
00:39:50,355 --> 00:39:52,724
So you gotta give Will credit
that probably 'Closed Mondays'

787
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,059
got executed at all.

788
00:39:54,092 --> 00:39:56,194
If it was up to Bob, that
film probably would never

789
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,963
have been made.

790
00:39:58,029 --> 00:40:00,298
As much art as he put into it,
he needed someone to guide him

791
00:40:00,365 --> 00:40:05,103
through actually
finishing something.

792
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:08,907
-Will produced it -- that's what
he did -- and a lot of the stuff

793
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:10,809
you see there is Bob.

794
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:12,310
The stuff that
people go, "Ooo-ooo!"

795
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,145
-- that's Bob.

797
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:20,719
-What was that guy thinking of?

798
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,288
Puh.

799
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:27,225
-With most things in life,
there was a grain of truth to

800
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,160
some of it.

801
00:40:29,227 --> 00:40:31,563
Was this just a really angry
guy who was making up all these

802
00:40:31,597 --> 00:40:34,733
ideas about what had
happened in that relationship,

803
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:38,604
or was he really an aggrieved
creative who felt he didn't get

804
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:42,440
his due?

00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,581
*news jingle

00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:50,982
-Portland's own
California Raisins are

807
00:40:51,016 --> 00:40:52,484
back in the news again.

808
00:40:52,518 --> 00:40:55,120
They have a new home video out,
and to give you an idea of how

809
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:57,322
good it's selling, it reached
platinum even before it hit

the stores.

811
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,960
-One of the first productions we
did as an entertainment project

812
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:05,864
was a CBS primetime special
called 'Meet the Raisins!' and

813
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:10,235
it was done rockumentary
parody of 'Meet the Beatles.'

814
00:41:11,236 --> 00:41:16,007
-The California Raisins, these
four working class musicians

815
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:19,945
have risen from garden
variety band to pop phenomenon.

816
00:41:20,546 --> 00:41:24,049
But what are the
roots of such genius?

817
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:26,685
From whence doth it spring?

818
00:41:26,718 --> 00:41:29,955
-[Will VO] First time I'd gotten
into primetime television.

819
00:41:30,288 --> 00:41:32,791
-It's a movie camera!

820
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:35,026
So do something.

discovery of tonal
resonance and harmony.

825
00:41:43,935 --> 00:41:48,106
-So far we had had anonymous
raisins in all of these spots,

826
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:50,576
and we wanted to kind of
create distinctive characters

827
00:41:50,576 --> 00:41:54,079
for entertainment purposes, so
we created the California Raisin

828
00:41:54,112 --> 00:41:55,213
Band with--

829
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,616

-[Will VO] The
show won a Primetime Emmy,

837
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:20,405
and that was a really, really
successful project in terms of

838
00:42:20,471 --> 00:42:23,174
popularity, and in terms of
moving the Raisins to a new

839
00:42:23,208 --> 00:42:26,845
level, which was just
pure music entertainment.

California Raisin commercials,
so I realized where he was

867
00:43:20,966 --> 00:43:25,003
going, and I said, "Michael,
you should be a Raisin."

868
00:43:25,036 --> 00:43:29,174
-The rap raisins
materializing behind me.

869
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:33,679
I wanted to define the character
and find his expression,

870
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:38,049
which is 99 percent of it.

871
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:42,153
The one guy has the glasses,
and he has the type of attitude

872
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:46,892
that-- he's so cool that
I'm fortunate that he's here.

873
00:43:47,893 --> 00:43:50,696
And he's much too
cool for, like, one of these.

874
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:55,834
It's like, "What
you lookin' at?"

875
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:58,036
The other raisin
would be this style,

876
00:43:58,069 --> 00:44:02,207
no glasses, so his eyes--
it's mostly the expression.

877
00:44:11,049 --> 00:44:15,286

Grapevine" by Michael Jackson*

00:44:36,808 --> 00:44:38,777
-[woman VO] There's no way
these princes of produce are

883
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:40,011
going to rot.

884
00:44:40,078 --> 00:44:42,981
They are one of the hottest
headliner acts in the country.

You may be wondering
who has the rights to

886
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:47,252
all that Raisin paraphernalia.

887
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:50,021
Well, it's the California
Raisins Advisory Board,

888
00:44:50,088 --> 00:44:52,323
not Will Vinton.

889
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,926
-This is the famous
blunder that he regretted,

890
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,596
where he didn't get a
portion of the licensing,

891
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,967
which nobody thought
was gonna be a big deal, really.

892
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,168
-Oh, my God.

893
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,402
Oh, my God.

894
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:08,940
We're talking about $400,000,000
in products that we could've had

-Oooh, this is a
harbinger of things to come.

897
00:45:14,612 --> 00:45:16,347

899
00:45:26,792 --> 00:45:30,028
-It was really hard after a
while to pull people's teeth

900
00:45:30,061 --> 00:45:33,865
[laughs] and to work on the
next Raisin show because we had

901
00:45:33,899 --> 00:45:37,435
already done that, and our
culture was built around,

902
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:38,804
you know, "Do
something different."

903
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:40,806
You know, "What else can we do?"

905
00:45:42,707 --> 00:45:45,243
-The studio was trying very
hard to create some intellectual

906
00:45:45,276 --> 00:45:48,146
property of its own, and they
wanted to try and create their

907
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:50,982
own characters that they would
own all the merchandising on,

908
00:45:51,049 --> 00:45:53,251
their own Mickey Mouse.

909
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:55,420
-[Will VO] We
have a character I'm very,

910
00:45:55,453 --> 00:45:56,988
very fond of.

911
00:45:57,055 --> 00:46:00,992
He's just been signed to a very,
very big role in a major feature

912
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:04,830
that we're developing right now,
and he and we are very excited

913
00:46:04,863 --> 00:46:05,831
about that.

914
00:46:05,864 --> 00:46:08,066
-I'm invincible!

915
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:13,138
I feel like I could
climb every mountain!

-[Chuck VO] The dream
behind Wilshire Pig was to be

917
00:46:17,308 --> 00:46:19,878
Will's Mickey Mouse.

918
00:46:19,911 --> 00:46:24,349
Instead of Mickey Mouse
ears we had rubber pig noses.

919
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:26,017
-[Melissa VO] Will
would used to say that Wilshire

920
00:46:26,051 --> 00:46:28,519
Pig was his alter ego.

921
00:46:28,553 --> 00:46:32,090
-You get offered five million
bucks to do a commercial,

922
00:46:32,157 --> 00:46:33,724
and you turned it down?

923
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:36,327
-There's the tycoon
element to that character.

924
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:39,530
He sort of like the
greedy capitalist.

925
00:46:39,564 --> 00:46:42,100
That might be the way that he
thought of himself as Wilshire

926
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:45,904
Pig, probably as not as the good
parts of himself but rather the

927
00:46:45,937 --> 00:46:49,440
kind of dirty things he had to
do to find success at the level

928
00:46:49,507 --> 00:46:50,741
that he found it.

a bunch of films with those

can make an amusement park."

935

-The point of amusement
rides is not amusement.

936
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:11,997

that would make
the amusement park.

943
00:47:28,379 --> 00:47:31,816
It's like he was
looking down a checklist,

944
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:35,120
and he was ticking off the
boxes of what he needed to

945
00:47:35,153 --> 00:47:38,023
become Disney.

Claymation Station,

948
00:47:46,965 --> 00:47:48,934
a year-round entertainment park.

949
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:51,669
It would be on 15 to 20
acres behind Union Station,

950
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,040
serving as a depot to
transport people to real places,

951
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:58,643
to other worlds, and to the
far reaches of imagination.

952
00:47:58,843 --> 00:48:01,646
There would be rides and
shops, a 3-D movie theater,

953
00:48:01,679 --> 00:48:05,083
restaurants, a large hotel,
and motion picture studios.

954

Can Will Vinton
make it a success?

955
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,956
Well, he's already
made raisins dance,

956
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:13,291
so who's to say his latest
brainstorm is pushing the

957
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:14,960
imagination too far?

962
00:48:23,301 --> 00:48:26,304
empty mining shafts.

963
00:48:26,337 --> 00:48:30,075
He'd still complain about
Will Vinton and how he got

964

ripped off.

It just kind of seemed
like him letting go.

968
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,990
He let go of his creativity.

969
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,126
He talked a lot about
Will, and that was it.

970
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:53,098
-Good morning everybody,
and welcome to Portland,

971
00:48:53,131 --> 00:48:55,133

Floral Parade which is

981
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,290
That's Will Vinton, the
Grand Marshal of the parade.

be safe -- got the FBI to patrol

cherished that into the sunset.

It's hard for me to talk
about it because it was such

a sad thing.

994
00:50:08,906 --> 00:50:11,842
I knew that he
was in a lot of pain.

When I heard that he had,
uh, committed suicide, um...

I was...

997
00:50:20,251 --> 00:50:22,987
I was...shocked.

I guess I-- you
could say, but...

999
00:50:26,624 --> 00:50:30,695
somehow strangely
not completely surprised.

1000
00:50:32,130 --> 00:50:36,534
I wished so much at that time
that I really could've helped to

1001

celebrate who he
was as a person,

1002

as an artist...

1003
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:47,945

I felt about the whole thing.

was really haunting,

1007
00:51:04,529 --> 00:51:06,931
looking at all the
stuff that he left out.

1008
00:51:06,964 --> 00:51:10,435
He had Marvin Gaye "Heard It
Through the Grapevine" sitting

1009

open on his little piano.

1010

That particular song

1011
00:51:17,142 --> 00:51:21,045
was this, like, goodbye to Will.

1012

My dad's work will
always keep him alive.

1013

I can always go back and
look through his writing.

1014
00:51:31,156 --> 00:51:32,390
I can look through his drawings.

1015
00:51:32,423 --> 00:51:35,426
I can watch 'Closed Mondays.'

1016
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,565
The expressions through his
drawings or his animation,

1017
00:51:40,598 --> 00:51:45,303
you get to see him in that,
and so that's where the artist

happening to me?

1038
00:52:34,952 --> 00:52:37,588
This should've worked!

1039
00:52:37,622 --> 00:52:39,224
-[Webster VO] People
just stopped giving a shit

1040
00:52:39,257 --> 00:52:40,858
because they were just so
disenchanted with what was

1041
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,927
going on.

1042
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,930
Important people
started to leave the studio.

1043
00:52:46,697 --> 00:52:49,133
-It was reaching that point
where you finally realized how

1044
00:52:49,234 --> 00:52:53,604
much work you were doing, and
you weren't getting credit for

1045
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:56,541
all the man hours
you were putting in.

1046
00:53:02,247 --> 00:53:05,015
-[Bill VO] He felt
it important --sometimes -- to

1047
00:53:05,049 --> 00:53:08,353
overlook some of the credit that
should perhaps have been given

1048
00:53:08,386 --> 00:53:12,657
to many of the talented
people actually making the work.

1049
00:53:14,124 --> 00:53:16,827
-He would actually say,
"It's Will Vinton Studios.

1050
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:21,866
We're all successful," but I do
think he also had that personal

1051
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:25,903
drive that he himself
wanted to be seen as the

1052
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:28,873
driving creative force.

1053
00:53:28,906 --> 00:53:30,308
[electricity sparks]

1054
00:53:30,341 --> 00:53:32,710
-[Bill VO] Certainly
Walt Disney did a great job of

1055
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:36,547
forging that visionary
personalization of his own name

1056
00:53:36,581 --> 00:53:38,316
as a brand itself.

1057
00:53:38,349 --> 00:53:40,318
[claps]

1058
00:53:40,351 --> 00:53:42,887
-[in Mickey Mouse voice]
Hey Pluto, here she comes!

1059
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,524
-The general perception was Walt
Disney drew every comic book,

1060
00:53:46,557 --> 00:53:49,927
made every short film and
feature film -- in fact the

1061
00:53:49,994 --> 00:53:53,331
studio perpetuated that myth.

1062
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:56,066
Of course that's why
the signature is the logo.

1063
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:00,405
He was an artist and
he signed his artwork.

1064
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:04,141
But when the artist looks
at Walt Disney to emulate,

1065
00:54:04,174 --> 00:54:07,845
that usually doesn't
work out too well.

1066
00:54:07,912 --> 00:54:10,080
-People resented that
he had these big goals,

1067
00:54:10,114 --> 00:54:12,617
and yet at the ground level
where we were working on stuff,

1068
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,786
we just didn't
like it that much.

1069
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,088
-Here's some Raisin news
right off the press for you;

1070
00:54:18,122 --> 00:54:20,958
starting this fall the
California Raisins will be added

1071
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,193
to the Saturday
morning cartoon lineup.

1072
00:54:23,328 --> 00:54:25,129
Will Vinton will
produce the show.

1073
00:54:25,162 --> 00:54:28,999
It won't be done in
Claymation, but cel animation.

1074
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:31,669
-*It's the
California Raisin Show!*

1075
00:54:31,702 --> 00:54:34,872
-That really was
against our grain,

1076
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:37,842
because it was Saturday morning,
because it really was kind of

1077
00:54:37,875 --> 00:54:39,344
for kids.

1078
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:42,212
-And so it was
less than a success.

1079
00:54:42,347 --> 00:54:44,549
-Whenever you get
really successful --

1080
00:54:44,615 --> 00:54:46,817
we were kind of the
flavor of the month --

1081
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:49,219
you go out of fashion.

*melancholy piano music

1083
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:56,894
-Guess those wrinkled rockers
were just a flash in the pan.

1084
00:54:56,961 --> 00:54:58,563
-[cartoon VO] Ouch!

1085
00:54:58,629 --> 00:54:59,697
-[Bill Fiesterman
VO] They were saying,

1086
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,165
"There's a lot of
Claymation on TV now,

1087
00:55:01,198 --> 00:55:03,434
and advertising agencies are
looking for something that looks

1088
00:55:03,468 --> 00:55:05,202
a little different."

1089
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:08,038
***

1090
00:55:13,411 --> 00:55:15,946
-You know, I
think we ought to...

1091
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:18,649
I don't wanna put
it in the negative.

1092
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:22,086
***

1093
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:23,721
-[Will VO] People had
always come to us for something

1094
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:26,657
that was really
unique and creative,

1095
00:55:26,724 --> 00:55:30,961
but people were starting to
say we were all about raisins.

1096
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:34,565
Suddenly there was this kind of
myopic sense about what we do as

1097
00:55:34,599 --> 00:55:38,403
filmmakers, and that was tough
for me -- a double-edged sword,

1098
00:55:38,403 --> 00:55:40,805
as they say.

1099
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:47,077
-The whole Claymation look
had kind of run its course,

1100
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:52,182
and it dropped out of style,
and the studios fell on pretty

1101
00:55:52,417 --> 00:55:54,519
hard times.

1102
00:55:54,585 --> 00:55:56,987
-Despite our
limitations as artists,

1103
00:55:57,021 --> 00:56:00,491
and our foibles like not
wanting to lay anybody off,

1104
00:56:00,525 --> 00:56:04,662
period -- which is just totally
a non-concept when it comes to

1105
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,497
proper business -- you
don't have the work,

1106
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:09,667
get rid of people, you know,
it's the mantra -- it wasn't

1107
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,770
even considered.

1108
00:56:13,037 --> 00:56:16,441
-They were having a really hard
time getting commercial work,

1109
00:56:16,507 --> 00:56:21,245
and there was very little
demand for what they were doing.

1110
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:26,283
Will saw the logic in expanding
their look and style and tools.

1111
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:31,689
-[Will VO] When I
first picked up clay...

1112
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:36,226
while the material was crude,
lumpy, didn't stand up straight,

1113
00:56:36,260 --> 00:56:38,563
rather quickly, I
could really see that the

1114
00:56:38,596 --> 00:56:41,031
possibilities were phenomenal.

1115
00:56:41,065 --> 00:56:42,967
I feel that we're in
exactly the same place

1116
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:45,470
with computer animation.

1117
00:56:45,470 --> 00:56:47,705
-[Chris VO] Computer
animation was brand new.

1118
00:56:47,738 --> 00:56:52,042
There had yet to be a
computer-animated movie and

1119
00:56:52,076 --> 00:56:55,279
computer animation was
just kind of a novelty.

1120
00:56:55,312 --> 00:56:57,815
-We really did
embrace the digital tools,

1121
00:56:57,882 --> 00:56:59,950
thinking this could
really bring some new energy,

1122
00:56:59,984 --> 00:57:02,920
some new life, some new ways
to bring to life characters.

1123
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:05,690
*funky music

1124
00:57:05,723 --> 00:57:09,359
One of the old-time advertisers
that wanted to move into the

1125
00:57:09,393 --> 00:57:12,329
digital world was M&M's.

1126
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:15,065
It was a big campaign, and
a lot of production companies

1127
00:57:15,132 --> 00:57:16,667
jumped on it.

1128
00:57:16,701 --> 00:57:19,904
So we actually had to compete,
but then nobody thought of us as

1129
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:23,407
a computer company at all,
as even having the tools.

1130
00:57:23,508 --> 00:57:25,342
And the truth is [whispers] we
didn't really have the tools.

1131
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:26,877
[laughs]

1132
00:57:26,911 --> 00:57:28,312
***

1133
00:57:28,345 --> 00:57:31,816
Our pitch to them was, "Anybody
can do the 3-D animation.

1134
00:57:31,849 --> 00:57:34,519
This is what we'd
like to see you doing.

1135
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:39,557
Name them -- Red, Yellow, Green,
Blue -- give them character,

1136
00:57:39,857 --> 00:57:43,728
give them attitude,
give them backstories,

1137
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:46,531
but above all just fill
them full of attitude."

1138
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:50,100
-*Yes it's true, yeah,
we're totally blue*

1139
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:51,736
-I wanna be in this commercial.

1140
00:57:51,769 --> 00:57:53,771
-You ain't getting this
job, 'cause you're not blue!

1141
00:57:53,838 --> 00:57:54,939
-Great.

1142
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:58,275
-[Will VO] It's so cool
to see the exact same characters

1143
00:57:58,342 --> 00:58:03,280
that we pitched have
endured to this day.

1144
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:05,349
-[David VO]
M&M's are a huge story.

1145
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:09,086
They came because Will had
successfully sold the image of

1146
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:10,955
Will Vinton as a creative force.

1147
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:14,024
It's a really really important
pivot because that was a cash

1148
00:58:14,091 --> 00:58:18,162
cow and a proving ground for
what the studio could be and

1149
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:21,465
became all throughout the '90s.

1150
00:58:21,566 --> 00:58:24,301
-[Chris VO] Everything
shifted during this time period.

1151
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,604
They were
sticking in photographs.

1152
00:58:26,637 --> 00:58:29,974
They were making characters
out of cardboard flats.

1153
00:58:30,007 --> 00:58:33,477
They were experimenting with
all these different materials to

1154
00:58:33,578 --> 00:58:37,281
make stop-motion puppets
and different graphic looks.

1155
00:58:37,314 --> 00:58:39,584
-Al, I'm wood.

1156
00:58:39,584 --> 00:58:41,686
What have I got to lose?

1157
00:58:41,719 --> 00:58:43,621
[mechanical whir]

1158
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:47,291
[saws buzz]

1159
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:49,660
Oh, no!

1160
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:51,829
-[Chris VO] In trying
all these different looks,

1161
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:55,499
they really revitalized interest
in the studio and was pretty

1162
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:58,135
successful again.

1163
00:58:58,168 --> 00:59:00,404
We kept getting more
and more accounts,

1164
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,641
and they started
hiring people like crazy.

1165
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:06,611
Most of the hiring that
they did was for full-time,

1166
00:59:06,611 --> 00:59:10,280
full-benefit staff positions.

1167
00:59:10,314 --> 00:59:13,751
It exploded in size.

1168
00:59:15,085 --> 00:59:17,121
-[Chuck VO] Will was always
supposed to just have a small

1169
00:59:17,154 --> 00:59:19,924
group of artists
that love what they do,

1170
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:21,892
and he loved what he did.

1171
00:59:21,926 --> 00:59:24,394
I don't think Will
was a businessman.

1172
00:59:24,428 --> 00:59:26,731
He was just more of a creator
and an artist and a guy with

1173
00:59:26,764 --> 00:59:30,635
ideas, and he had fun at it.

1174
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,670
-[Will VO] As
we grew the company,

1175
00:59:32,737 --> 00:59:36,106
it was becoming a little less
creatively satisfying for me.

1176
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:40,144
I was doing a lot of stuff that
was not the things that excited

1177
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:44,114
me about being an
artist, about being a creator,

1178
00:59:44,148 --> 00:59:49,019
so I was looking for more
creative things that I could do.

1179
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:53,123
-We have a special guest
tonight on Oregon Art Beat,

1180
00:59:53,157 --> 00:59:56,293
the man who made
Claymation a household word.

1181
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:58,095
Casey is with Will Vinton.

1182
00:59:58,128 --> 00:59:59,296
-That's right, I am.

1183
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:01,098
Thank you very much, Mike,
and thank you for joining us.

1184
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:02,199
-Oh, a pleasure.

1185
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:03,768
-[Casey] We've got some
tape that shows a little bit of

1186
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:04,835
the process.

1187
01:00:04,869 --> 01:00:06,470
Why don't we roll that
tape so we can see it,

1188
01:00:06,503 --> 01:00:08,806
and you can kind of
narrate it as we go along.

1189
01:00:08,839 --> 01:00:10,607
-[Will VO] What you
see here is Thurgood

1190
01:00:10,641 --> 01:00:14,211
who is in 'The PJs' which
is our television show.

1191
01:00:14,278 --> 01:00:16,313
-What happened is, I
described what the guy was like,

1192
01:00:16,346 --> 01:00:19,183
what his personality was
like, and Will Vinton would go,

1193
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:21,051
and he'd make up sketches.

1194
01:00:21,118 --> 01:00:23,553
Then once I looked at him, then
I'd come up with a voice that

1195
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:26,056
looks like what he
would sound like.

1196
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:27,391
-Hello, projects!

1197
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,894
[cheering]

1198
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:33,330
I am the Reverend
Thurgood Stubbs.

1199
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:36,300
-I worked very closely
with Eddie to do the pilot,

1200
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,068
and that was fun, and
that was really creative,

1201
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:41,806
and that was me getting
my feet back into it.

1202
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,874
[helicopter sounds]

1203
01:00:43,908 --> 01:00:45,142
-I can't take this anymore!

1204
01:00:45,175 --> 01:00:47,211
I can't take it!

1205
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:50,247
-But not as satisfying for
for me personally as doing

1206
01:00:50,314 --> 01:00:51,749
my own thing.

1207
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:52,917
-[Casey] What can we look
forward to seeing from you in

1208
01:00:52,983 --> 01:00:54,184
the future?

1209
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:56,353
-We have another show that'll be
launching called 'Gary & Mike'

1210
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:59,356
that's gonna run on
Fox through the summer.

1211
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:02,026
-There ain't nothing but
open road from here on out.

1212
01:01:02,059 --> 01:01:03,427
[car sputters]

1213
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,763
-[Will VO] We
really scaled it up.

1214
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:09,066
We did 13 half-hour
shows of 'The PJs'--

1215
01:01:09,099 --> 01:01:11,601
-Don't worry.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

1216
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:13,403
Whoops! [grunts]

1217
01:01:13,437 --> 01:01:15,472
-[Will VO]
Eight of 'Gary & Mike'--

1218
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,741
-Good luck!

1219
01:01:16,741 --> 01:01:19,443
-You're the one
who's gonna need it!

1220
01:01:19,476 --> 01:01:24,481
-80 or 90 major commercials,
all in a year's time.

1221
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:28,518
They also were
significant revenue generators,

1222
01:01:28,585 --> 01:01:31,956
but I was
definitely into a new mode.

1223
01:01:31,989 --> 01:01:36,326
I'm not the
filmmaker-entrepreneur at all.

1224
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:40,530
It was kind of a beast with
a life of its own that didn't

1225
01:01:40,597 --> 01:01:43,533
really equal me so much anymore.

1226
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,202
-When you started, you
were a very small shop,

1227
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:46,771
and now -- I think you were
telling me -- you have three

1228
01:01:46,804 --> 01:01:48,172
buildings in northwest Portland?

1229
01:01:48,205 --> 01:01:49,840
-[Will VO] Yeah,
we have three buildings,

1230
01:01:49,874 --> 01:01:51,108
sometimes four.

1231
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:52,877
-[Casey VO] And how
much of a staff now?

1232
01:01:52,943 --> 01:01:55,813
-[Will VO] Well over 300
artists and animators and

1233
01:01:55,846 --> 01:01:57,647
staff-people.

1234
01:01:57,681 --> 01:02:00,284
-Well, we'll be seeing lots
of you as the years go by.

1235
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:02,552
Will, thank you so much for
joining us on Oregon Art Beat.

1236
01:02:02,619 --> 01:02:03,888
-My pleasure.

*"You've Got a Friend
in Me" by Randy Newman*

1238
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,024
-[Charlie VO] 'Toy Story'
made history last year as the

1239
01:02:07,057 --> 01:02:10,060
first
computer-generated feature film.

1240
01:02:10,094 --> 01:02:13,030
Joining me now,
Pixar's chairman and CEO,

1241
01:02:13,063 --> 01:02:14,799
Steve Jobs.

1242
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:17,935
-We're about putting
stories into the culture,

1243
01:02:17,968 --> 01:02:19,636
that's what we're--
We're about telling stories.

1244
01:02:19,703 --> 01:02:20,805
And you know--

1245
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:22,206
-I'm gonna come back and
interview you in five years and

1246
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:25,375
find out you're in some other
business and you found some

1247
01:02:25,409 --> 01:02:26,610
other well to go fishing in?

1248
01:02:26,643 --> 01:02:29,313
-You know, I tend to stay
where I start until somebody

1249
01:02:29,379 --> 01:02:30,480
kicks me out.

1250
01:02:30,547 --> 01:02:32,817
[laughter]

1251
01:02:32,883 --> 01:02:35,585
-[Will VO] Steve Jobs seemed
to have an interest in us

1252
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:38,155
as a television organization.

1253
01:02:38,222 --> 01:02:41,125
After quite a bit of due
diligence between the companies,

1254
01:02:41,158 --> 01:02:44,829
they came back and floated the
idea that Pixar would purchase

1255
01:02:44,829 --> 01:02:49,834
us and purchase all of
my stock for Pixar stock.

1256
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:53,137
I'm going, "Well, what-
you know, okay, I'm sitting on

1257
01:02:53,170 --> 01:02:56,173
millions of shares of Will
Vinton Studios stock and there's

1258
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,276
this company called Pixar,
so I'd be trading that for

1259
01:02:59,309 --> 01:03:02,612
millions of shares or
something of this Pixar stock,"

1260
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:05,382
and basically just
rejected it out of hand.

1261
01:03:05,415 --> 01:03:09,887
Well, jump forward
about [laughs] 10/15 years.

1262
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:14,191
If I had taken that deal, I'd be
probably arguably be one of the

1263
01:03:14,224 --> 01:03:16,660
largest, maybe the
largest shareholder of Disney.

1264
01:03:16,693 --> 01:03:19,063
[laughs]

1265
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:23,233
-[man] You've been a
businessman for many years.

1266
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:25,102
-[laughs]

1267
01:03:25,169 --> 01:03:26,536
Of sorts.

1268
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:30,407
-Why did you step
down as CEO in 1997?

1269
01:03:30,440 --> 01:03:35,112
-I really wanted to get back to
doing what I had always-- what I

1270
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:39,249
used to do, which was more
development and directing and

1271
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:42,452
focus on that, on
the creative side.

1272
01:03:42,519 --> 01:03:46,690
-[Will VO] I was really eager to
get back into being a director,

1273
01:03:46,723 --> 01:03:51,228
and I was kind of ready
to shed responsibility.

1274
01:03:51,261 --> 01:03:54,932
I ended up deciding that I
really did need to bring in a

1275
01:03:54,965 --> 01:03:59,269
CEO that could come in and
handle the business side.

1276
01:04:01,738 --> 01:04:04,141
We actually came up with a
guy that I thought the world of

1277
01:04:04,174 --> 01:04:05,910
named Tom Turpin.

1278
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:08,545
-[David VO] Tom Turpin
was a Gentleman's Quarterly

1279
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:11,515
version of your
ideal CEO candidate.

1280
01:04:11,548 --> 01:04:14,118
He looked good, he
could say the right things,

1281
01:04:14,151 --> 01:04:19,023
he was always very
warm in a Hollywood way.

1282
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:22,927
-People were leery when Tom
Turpin started because he was

1283
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:27,064
just this dashing,
charming, fast-talking guy.

1284
01:04:28,032 --> 01:04:30,067
And Will just loved him.

1285
01:04:30,134 --> 01:04:33,703
We were like, "The guy just
says whatever you want to hear."

1286
01:04:33,737 --> 01:04:35,305
-Are you ready to make your
wildest dreams come true?

1287
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:36,806
Of course you are!

1288
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:38,008
-Whoa!

1289
01:04:38,008 --> 01:04:41,946
-I actually joined April 1st,
1997 -- April Fools Day --

1290
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:42,947
and I dug it.

1291
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,049
I just thought it
was a cool place, very cool.

1292
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:47,151
The ad division was
really a cash cow,

1293
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:48,752
and it really covered
a lot of the overhead,

1294
01:04:48,818 --> 01:04:50,754
so when the TV shows
came in, they started making

1295
01:04:50,820 --> 01:04:51,956
a lot of money.

1296
01:04:51,956 --> 01:04:53,958
We actually made a lot of money.

1297
01:04:53,958 --> 01:04:56,426
-[Will VO] One of the things
that our CEO felt we should do

1298
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:58,095
is raise capital.

1299
01:04:58,162 --> 01:05:00,430
Well, that's a completely
different concept than what we

1300
01:05:00,497 --> 01:05:01,531
had ever had.

1301
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:03,433
You know, what are we
gonna do with this capital?

1302
01:05:03,500 --> 01:05:06,236
And of course the mantra was,
"You raise capital when you

1303
01:05:06,270 --> 01:05:07,237
don't need it."

1304
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:10,640
[laughing] Oh, okay, all right.

1305
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:13,978
I think that
sounds right. [laughs]

1306
01:05:13,978 --> 01:05:17,281
-[man] Take a look
at exhibit four, please.

1307
01:05:18,582 --> 01:05:20,017
-[Tom VO] Phil, I
couldn't think of a more

1308
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:22,586
prestigious investor than that.

1309
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:26,290
We reminded him of when he was
at the beginning of his career,

1310
01:05:26,323 --> 01:05:28,993
and there was
something fun in that for him.

1311
01:05:28,993 --> 01:05:32,296
Company like Nike is so big;
it just turns into a monster

1312
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:35,299
business, and your
role changes, right?

1313
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:38,835
He just remembered that
kind of entrepreneurial juice,

1314
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:42,706
and he saw it in us
-- let's just do it.

1315
01:05:43,107 --> 01:05:47,511
For $5,000,000, Phil acquired
15 percent of the company.

1316
01:05:47,544 --> 01:05:50,114
-[man] I heard you got offered
five million bucks to do one of

1317
01:05:50,147 --> 01:05:52,482
those tennis shoe
ads, is that true?

1318
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:55,652
-Whoa, $5,000,000?

1319
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:58,022
-I still liked the idea
of getting in the feature

1320
01:05:58,055 --> 01:05:59,789
film business.

1321
01:05:59,823 --> 01:06:01,025
-[Tom VO] To
move into features,

1322
01:06:01,025 --> 01:06:03,527
you need to have a
deep pocket behind you.

1323
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:08,098
Pixar had Steve Jobs, and
now Vinton has Phil Knight.

1324
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:10,134
-[Jeffrey VO] I can't think
that any other business that

1325
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,069
he's invested in is stayed.

1326
01:06:12,102 --> 01:06:16,706
It was totally out of
character for Phil to do that.

1327
01:06:16,740 --> 01:06:20,644
Knight had so much money; it was
going to be a great partnership.

1328
01:06:23,447 --> 01:06:26,616
-[Will VO] Having built this
company, and 25 years later I

1329
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:30,587
actually was looking at a kind
of exit strategy to slip into a

1330
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:35,625
different role and allow me
the time to do my own projects.

1331
01:06:36,226 --> 01:06:38,395
-[Tom VO] I think that
Will's real dream was to be

1332
01:06:38,428 --> 01:06:40,397
making feature films.

1333
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,766
[chimes]

1334
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:46,736
-[man VO] Will Vinton Features
presents 'The Frog Prince.'

1335
01:06:47,071 --> 01:06:50,907
-We've taken the timeless appeal
of the Brothers Grimm story and

1336
01:06:50,940 --> 01:06:54,844
made it into this
expansive, magical,

1337
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:58,415
emotionally
engaging musical comedy.

1338
01:06:58,448 --> 01:07:03,453
-He was so optimistic and
excited and enthusiastic about

1339
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,090
everything that he did.

1340
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:09,359
Not only were we gonna have
'Gary & Mike' and 'The PJs'

1341
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:14,398
running, but we had three
pilots that were in production.

1342
01:07:14,431 --> 01:07:17,334
And at the same time, it was
looking like some of these

1343
01:07:17,367 --> 01:07:20,737
feature films were gonna
happen; 'Corpse Bride' started

1344
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:23,107
to happen.

1345
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:29,179
It felt like all of
Will's dreams were coming true.

1346
01:07:31,415 --> 01:07:36,420
-Mr. Knight had been a
shareholder since 1998, correct?

1347
01:07:37,187 --> 01:07:38,288
-Correct.

1348
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:40,124
-[man] And he had been
very hands-off, hadn't he?

1349
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:41,291
-Yes, that's correct.

1350
01:07:41,358 --> 01:07:44,261
-And his son had been an
employee from about that same

1351
01:07:44,294 --> 01:07:46,029
point in time, correct?

1352
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:48,565
-That was one of the things
that Phil wanted as part of that

1353
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:52,269
first investment was for his
son to have employment there.

01:07:55,972 --> 01:07:58,208

"I have a son who's in the

1356
01:07:58,242 --> 01:07:59,309
creative world.

1357
01:07:59,376 --> 01:08:01,711
He likes animation;
he's rapping now."

all this millionaire homeboy
really wants is to have his very

1367
01:08:21,998 --> 01:08:24,168
own posse.

1368
01:08:24,201 --> 01:08:26,970
I mean what's your response to
the kind of support or lack of

1369
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:28,672
support you've
had from Portland?

1370
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:30,374
-A lot of people have
a problem with me just because

1371
01:08:30,407 --> 01:08:32,242
they think I'm tryin' to front
or tryin' to fake or tryin' to

1372
01:08:32,309 --> 01:08:33,510
be Black or whatever.

1373
01:08:33,543 --> 01:08:35,078
Think I'm tryin' to
be something I'm not.

1374
01:08:35,179 --> 01:08:36,713
-[man] So you're kind of
like a homeboy without a posse

1375
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:38,182
in a way.

1376
01:08:38,215 --> 01:08:39,649
-Yeah pretty much.

1377
01:08:39,683 --> 01:08:43,753
-Any young person, especially
any young son of a really

1378
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:48,525
successful wealthy person, it's
a struggle to find an identity,

1379
01:08:48,558 --> 01:08:52,762
and Will hasn't
wished to be a great rapper.

1380
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:56,400
But he found his niche and he
went to work for the company

1381
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:58,235
that his dad's invested in.

1382
01:08:58,268 --> 01:08:59,669
[record scratches]

1383
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:01,338
-[Tom VO] He
started like everybody started.

1384
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:03,673
You don't need to know anything;
come and sweep the floors,

1385
01:09:03,707 --> 01:09:05,242
see if you like it.

1386
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:08,278
Will and I thought the best way
to support Travis is not to tell

1387
01:09:08,312 --> 01:09:10,647
anybody that Phil
Knight's his dad.

1388
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:13,517
I don't think anybody
knew for three years.

1389
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:15,352
-To Travis's credit,
he seemed to really,

1390
01:09:15,419 --> 01:09:18,955
really love the animation
and took to it right away.

1391
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:22,759
-[man] What are your goals
or plans as far as Travis's

1392
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:24,428
involvement in the company?

1393
01:09:24,461 --> 01:09:25,929
-Well they're not my
plans; they're his plans,

1394
01:09:25,962 --> 01:09:30,634
that essentially his
plan is to be an animator.

1395
01:09:30,667 --> 01:09:32,469
That's what he loves doing.

1396
01:09:32,502 --> 01:09:35,805
He doesn't have management
ambition at the present time.

1397
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:37,974
He doesn't even want to be a
director at the present time.

1398
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,644
He wants to be an animator,
which he's very good at.

1399
01:09:40,677 --> 01:09:44,681
*moody ambient music

1400
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:47,150
-[Chris VO] Will's
enthusiasm was the company's

1401
01:09:47,251 --> 01:09:50,287
greatest asset and
probably the greatest danger.

1402
01:09:52,256 --> 01:09:56,826
Both Tom Turpin and Will Vinton
were just raving and so excited

1403
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,662
about what was happening.

1404
01:09:58,695 --> 01:10:01,064
And there were all
these dreams and goals,

1405
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:03,500
but they never
seemed to have a plan B.

1406
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,669
You know, what are you
gonna do if it doesn't happen?

1407
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,304
He's like, "It'll happen."

1408
01:10:07,337 --> 01:10:12,041
-When Tom Turpin came in, it
became a very corporate place.

1409
01:10:12,075 --> 01:10:15,479
The whole structure -- the
feeling -- was different.

1410
01:10:15,512 --> 01:10:18,315
I would say it was a
completely different company.

1411
01:10:18,348 --> 01:10:23,019
-The "MBA" approach to CEO is
as all-powerful management,

1412
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,221
we know best.

1413
01:10:25,255 --> 01:10:30,193
-[man] Why was Mr.
Turpin's contract not renewed?

1414
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:34,998
-Primarily because
of his performance.

1415
01:10:35,031 --> 01:10:38,602
As Tom's policies
began to take effect,

1416
01:10:38,668 --> 01:10:41,505
we started losing money and
started spending an awful lot

1417
01:10:41,538 --> 01:10:43,106
of money.

1418
01:10:43,172 --> 01:10:45,709
-[David VO] Tom Turpin
wasn't making great decisions.

1419
01:10:45,742 --> 01:10:48,845
A lot of money was being thrown
in a lot of stupid places.

1420
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:51,948
There's the legend of the
million dollar escalator.

1421
01:10:52,015 --> 01:10:54,684
They had rented two levels
of an office in an LA to look

1422
01:10:54,718 --> 01:10:58,254
impressive as they were
seducing and wooing studios.

1423
01:10:58,288 --> 01:11:01,691
Tom had the great idea to put
in an escalator between the two

1424
01:11:01,725 --> 01:11:04,060
floors because it would
be a dramatic entrance,

1425
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:07,364
sort of like going up the
escalator to creative heaven at

1426
01:11:07,431 --> 01:11:10,767
Will Vinton's
Hollywood swanky pad.

1427
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:14,938
-[man] When was
'The PJs' cancelled?

1428
01:11:14,971 --> 01:11:16,806
-It was the early part of 2001.

1429
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,042
-What was the name of the
other television series?

1430
01:11:19,108 --> 01:11:20,344
-'Gary & Mike.'

1431
01:11:20,344 --> 01:11:23,547
-And when did it
cease being on TV?

1432
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:26,350
-I believe it was right
around the same time.

1433
01:11:26,350 --> 01:11:28,184
-[Tom VO] TV
shows get cancelled.

1434
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:31,521
These TV shows were like
two-thirds of our revenue --

1435
01:11:31,555 --> 01:11:34,358
$10,000,000-a-year projects --
and then if they go away it's

1436
01:11:34,358 --> 01:11:37,361
like, "Boom,
$10,000,000 is gone."

1437
01:11:37,361 --> 01:11:40,964
-The pilots -- one by one
-- don't get picked up,

1438
01:11:40,997 --> 01:11:43,867
and then the feature films
they've been talking about,

1439
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,003
none of those come to fruition.

1440
01:11:47,036 --> 01:11:49,406
And then everything
started to come apart.

1441
01:11:49,473 --> 01:11:53,176
-How would you describe the
financial condition of Will

1442
01:11:53,209 --> 01:11:58,047
Vinton Studios during
the spring of 2002?

1443
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:01,651
-It was [clears throat]
struggling, not good.

1444
01:12:01,685 --> 01:12:03,853
-[Melissa VO] We have
to support all these people,

1445
01:12:03,887 --> 01:12:07,090
and suddenly your
money-making machine stops,

1446
01:12:07,123 --> 01:12:08,492
but you're
still spending money,

1447
01:12:08,558 --> 01:12:11,160
you're literally bleeding money.

1448
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:12,762
-If it had been Hollywood,
it would have been a totally

1449
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:15,565
different deal, because all of
these guys would have been on

1450
01:12:15,599 --> 01:12:18,435
contract -- they would have been
temporary workers -- and the

1451
01:12:18,468 --> 01:12:21,838
minute the work went
away, they would be gone.

1452
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:26,910
-Was it in that context that the
company approached Phil Knight

1453
01:12:27,243 --> 01:12:31,314
about a possible
additional investment?

1454
01:12:31,415 --> 01:12:33,116
-Yes.

1455
01:12:33,149 --> 01:12:36,252
-He had an army of really smart
businesspeople putting together

1456
01:12:36,285 --> 01:12:38,622
the contracts to
protect his investment.

1457
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,524
There were stacks
like this of contracts,

1458
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:42,125
you know, that I
didn't even read,

1459
01:12:42,158 --> 01:12:43,960
you know, when we
probably signed up the thing.

1460
01:12:43,993 --> 01:12:46,095
-When you want a loan, there's
only one person you need to

1461
01:12:46,129 --> 01:12:48,264
see--
[quirky sound effect]

1462
01:12:48,297 --> 01:12:49,666
The Brains.

1463
01:12:49,699 --> 01:12:51,801
-It was not an
investment I wanted to make.

1464
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:54,003
It was not a good
economic investment,

1465
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:55,439
in my view.

1466
01:12:55,439 --> 01:12:58,141
Will Vinton seemed to me to
be trying to commit suicide for

1467
01:12:58,174 --> 01:12:59,809
the company.

1468
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:03,146
-He thought that Phil Knight
would be a benign benefactor who

1469
01:13:03,179 --> 01:13:05,682
knew the shoe business.
[laughs]

1470
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:08,184
I remember Will saying to
me, "There's no business like

1471
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:09,619
shoe business."

1472
01:13:09,686 --> 01:13:11,521
***

1473
01:13:11,555 --> 01:13:15,058
-I was aware of the fact
that if we had a downturn,

1474
01:13:15,091 --> 01:13:18,061
that he would be able to
take certain kind of control.

1475
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:20,597
But we'd been
profitable 23 years out of 25,

1476
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:23,366
so what was I worried about?

1477
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:28,271
-Do you remember him telling
you that if he was to make an

1478
01:13:28,304 --> 01:13:33,309
additional investment, that he
would drive a very hard bargain?

1479
01:13:33,877 --> 01:13:35,244
-[Will] Yes.

1480
01:13:35,278 --> 01:13:38,114
-Do you think Mr.
Knight drove a hard bargain?

1481
01:13:38,147 --> 01:13:39,816
-Sure, absolutely.

1482
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:43,386
-He was driving a
very hard bargain, correct?

1483
01:13:43,487 --> 01:13:44,654
-[Will] That's correct.

1484
01:13:44,721 --> 01:13:47,724
Could I get a little
more water, or-- could I?

1485
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:50,494
-[man VO] Phil Knight versus
Will Vinton was sort of like the

1486
01:13:50,494 --> 01:13:52,796
great white
shark versus a guppy.

1487
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:55,832
[water bubbles]

1488
01:13:55,899 --> 01:13:57,501
-[Melissa VO]
Will must've been somewhat

1489
01:13:57,567 --> 01:14:01,070
blindsided, or maybe didn't
understand that Phil Knight

1490
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:03,406
would play hardball with him.

1491
01:14:03,507 --> 01:14:08,512
-Were you aware at the time you
signed the employment agreement

1492
01:14:09,546 --> 01:14:14,551
that it authorized your
termination without cause?

1493
01:14:14,718 --> 01:14:18,087
***

1494
01:14:18,154 --> 01:14:19,823
-Sure.

1495
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:24,861
-Did you have an understanding
what "without cause" meant?

1496
01:14:26,563 --> 01:14:29,733
-Um, a basic
understanding, I guess.

1497
01:14:29,766 --> 01:14:33,436
-Did you understand that
it meant any reason or no reason

1498
01:14:33,537 --> 01:14:36,439
at all?

1499
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,608
-[laughs]

1500
01:14:40,443 --> 01:14:42,011
-[Will VO] Now we're
into some really heavy-duty

1501
01:14:42,045 --> 01:14:43,446
business stuff.

1502
01:14:43,547 --> 01:14:47,083
The company's losing money,
and we had a lot of commitments.

1503
01:14:47,116 --> 01:14:50,887
-[Tom VO] They were
hemorrhaging money like crazy.

1504
01:14:51,454 --> 01:14:55,892
-In business, the best deals
are kind of win-win deals.

1505
01:14:55,925 --> 01:14:58,562
That's not the way
they liked to play.

1506
01:14:58,595 --> 01:15:01,765
If somebody's winning,
that means you're losing.

1507
01:15:01,798 --> 01:15:05,669
-[Jeffrey VO] Phil Knight slowly
started taking possession.

1508
01:15:05,702 --> 01:15:10,707
He acquired a lot of it
without Will knowing about it.

1509
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:15,378
Phil Knight soon had a
majority of the stock.

1510
01:15:17,213 --> 01:15:19,716
-[man VO] Why were you
interested of taking voting

1511
01:15:19,783 --> 01:15:21,851
control of the company?

1512
01:15:21,885 --> 01:15:24,487
-I had to get
something for my investment.

1513
01:15:24,588 --> 01:15:26,690
If it had just been the
economics of the situation,

1514
01:15:26,723 --> 01:15:28,692
I would never have done it.

1515
01:15:28,725 --> 01:15:30,994
But I had a son that worked
there that loved the company,

1516
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,462
that loved his job, loved
the people he worked with,

1517
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:36,465
had a chance to work with Tim
Burton -- who's probably the

1518
01:15:36,499 --> 01:15:39,368
ultimate in terms of
animation, creative,

1519
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:43,840
respect, and talent -- and I
concluded that I would try and

1520
01:15:43,873 --> 01:15:46,876
keep the company alive.

1521
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:51,047
Why on earth did you
not just say thank you?

1522
01:15:55,752 --> 01:15:58,487
-[man] At this point in time,
had you resigned yourself to the

1523
01:15:58,521 --> 01:16:03,326
fact that your days were
numbered at Will Vinton Studios?

1524
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:07,063
-I really couldn't believe
that would be an outcome of

1525
01:16:07,096 --> 01:16:08,965
this business.

1526
01:16:08,998 --> 01:16:12,802
Nobody in their right mind
would lay off the founder of the

1527
01:16:12,836 --> 01:16:17,841
company and the rainmaker
for most of the business,

1528
01:16:17,907 --> 01:16:22,912
except somebody who had other
motives and some deep pocket to

01:16:23,079 --> 01:16:26,249
back it up and go
somewhere else with it.

1530
01:16:26,983 --> 01:16:31,955
It was clear that Phil had made
up his mind that he was going to

1531
01:16:31,988 --> 01:16:33,657
take that company.

from your employment at Will

01:16:44,433 --> 01:16:45,835
Vinton Studios?

1537
01:16:45,869 --> 01:16:49,505
-[sighs] Yes, I was.

1538
01:16:53,309 --> 01:16:58,314
-What is the factual basis for
your assertion that Phil Knight

1539
01:16:58,682 --> 01:17:03,519
wanted to take control of this
company to turn the company over

1540
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:05,554
to Travis Knight?

1541
01:17:05,588 --> 01:17:10,593
-Well, the fact that
Phil requested Travis's

1542
01:17:10,860 --> 01:17:12,929
employment way back.

1543
01:17:12,962 --> 01:17:17,266
The fact that Travis stayed
a part of the organization,

1544
01:17:17,300 --> 01:17:22,405
you know, the Chilly
Tee fiasco happened.

1545
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:25,942
Which I suspect that this was a
little more compatible way to

1546
01:17:25,975 --> 01:17:29,078
use money to get
into the business.

1547
01:17:29,112 --> 01:17:31,580
Heck, it's hard to imagine
any other motivation,

1548
01:17:31,614 --> 01:17:34,383
to be frank.

-[Jeffrey VO] There
are these issues of nepotism.

1550
01:17:37,220 --> 01:17:40,223
There are these issues of,
"Did Phil Knight take advantage

1551
01:17:40,256 --> 01:17:42,091
of Will?"

This collision of Phil Knight

versus commerce --
they were at odds,

1555
01:17:50,734 --> 01:17:53,402
and...

1556
01:17:53,436 --> 01:17:57,841
Will came out the
loser of that battle.

1557
01:17:57,907 --> 01:18:01,978
-[man] You're aware that
you're entitled to a termination

1558
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,780
payment, correct?

1559
01:18:03,813 --> 01:18:04,981
-Yes.

1560
01:18:05,014 --> 01:18:07,050
-You got the $50,000, correct?

1561
01:18:07,083 --> 01:18:08,084
-[Will] That's correct.

1562
01:18:08,151 --> 01:18:10,586
-You never got the
$150,000, isn't that right?

1563
01:18:10,653 --> 01:18:11,888
-[Will] That's correct.

1564
01:18:11,955 --> 01:18:15,424
-And that's because one of those
conditions was that the 'Corpse

1565
01:18:15,491 --> 01:18:19,195
Bride' contract be
signed, correct?

1566
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:20,997
-[laughs] Yes.

1567
01:18:21,030 --> 01:18:24,768
-Was it only coincidental that
the 'Corpse Bride' contract was

1568
01:18:24,768 --> 01:18:27,904
signed the day after Mr.
Vinton's was terminated?

1569
01:18:27,937 --> 01:18:29,939
-Yes.

1570
01:18:30,006 --> 01:18:34,177

away with $50,000 for a lifetime

creative struggle.

1572
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,949
That's ridiculous.

1573
01:18:40,016 --> 01:18:42,786
-[Michele VO] There was
no need to do that mean stuff.

1574
01:18:42,786 --> 01:18:47,523
They took Claymation, the
name-- they took everything.

1575
01:18:47,556 --> 01:18:49,793
They didn't need to do that.

1576
01:18:49,793 --> 01:18:53,062
I think that's
really "poor paper,"

1577
01:18:53,096 --> 01:18:55,598
as my grandma would say.

you are no longer employed by

1579
01:18:59,368 --> 01:19:00,970
that company?

1580
01:19:01,037 --> 01:19:05,308
-I absolutely did not
want to leave that company.

1581
01:19:05,341 --> 01:19:08,812
-And you have told the public
or people that you are happier

1582
01:19:08,812 --> 01:19:11,714
today that you're no
longer employed by the company.

1583
01:19:11,815 --> 01:19:16,152
-How could I be happy about
having left the company that I

1584
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:21,190
built, that I am so close to?

1585
01:19:21,724 --> 01:19:26,662
It was like a family, and I had
my entire net worth wrapped up

1586
01:19:26,695 --> 01:19:28,497
in that company.

1587
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:31,500

1589
01:19:42,045 --> 01:19:43,913
Yeah.

I have for today!

01:20:36,632 --> 01:20:39,368
Vinton Studios
belongs to Travis Knight,

1598
01:20:39,402 --> 01:20:43,139
and that between
Travis and his father Phil,

1599
01:20:43,206 --> 01:20:44,473
it's Laika.

1600
01:20:44,540 --> 01:20:46,209
-[reporter VO] It's the little
studio that could -- Laika --

1601
01:20:46,242 --> 01:20:47,944
the CEO of the
company is Travis Knight.

1602
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:50,446
He joins us now
from Portland, Oregon.

1603
01:20:50,479 --> 01:20:51,747
-Something just evolved.

1604
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:53,816
It was an opportunity that
came up that I-- you know,

1605
01:20:53,883 --> 01:20:55,151
who would think you
could actually make a living

1606
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:56,252
doing this?

1607
01:20:56,319 --> 01:20:58,587
It does not seem like
it's a plausible life plan,

1608
01:20:58,621 --> 01:21:00,123
but it's
something I always loved.

1609
01:21:00,156 --> 01:21:01,891
And when I had the-- when the
opportunity was presented to me,

1610
01:21:01,925 --> 01:21:05,494
I took it-- I took, you know,
grabbed it and ran with it.

1611
01:21:05,528 --> 01:21:06,495
-[reporter] So was
Laika the opportunity,

1612
01:21:06,529 --> 01:21:07,931
or was there another
thing before that?

1613
01:21:07,964 --> 01:21:11,534
-No, I was-- I worked at another
animation house before then.

1614
01:21:11,567 --> 01:21:16,405
-Travis -- by all accounts -- is
a talented guy and transcended

1615
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:20,343
any sort of talk that this
was all about finding sonny

01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,345

1617
01:21:22,378 --> 01:21:25,514
-[Melissa VO] It's just
sad that Will was able to take

1618
01:21:25,548 --> 01:21:30,153
his dream to a certain point
and was not able to go to that

1619
01:21:30,186 --> 01:21:33,056

1620
01:21:33,089 --> 01:21:35,558

build it up to this point where

1622
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:39,695
it got as big as it
was ever gonna get,

1623
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:43,032
and then ka-blooey,
then lose the thing.

1624
01:21:43,066 --> 01:21:46,435
How could he build all this up
and then it gets taken away?

1625
01:21:46,502 --> 01:21:48,404
-[Chuck VO] It goes
back to the Disney thing.

1626

It's great that
he had that dream,

1627
01:21:51,607 --> 01:21:53,709
but he couldn't do it.

1628
01:21:53,742 --> 01:21:58,547
It's sort of this Disney
ghost that haunted him.

1629
01:21:58,581 --> 01:22:02,451
-I was all broken up
after he got let go,

1630
01:22:02,518 --> 01:22:07,123
and I went to see him at
a little farewell party.

1631
01:22:07,156 --> 01:22:10,193
He said, "I just feel relief."

1632
01:22:10,259 --> 01:22:13,429
He said, "I've been so worried
about how I'm gonna pay the

1633
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:18,167
bills, how I'm gonna keep
these people employed."

in his motorboat and zoomed into

Willamette from his house.

1636
01:22:22,805 --> 01:22:24,273
I'm like, "Dude, you're cut."

1637
01:22:24,307 --> 01:22:26,442
And he's just like, [motorboat
sound] in his motorboat,

1638
01:22:26,475 --> 01:22:30,013
and I'm like, "Man, clearly
this guy-- the worst things can

1639
01:22:30,013 --> 01:22:33,382
happen to this guy and
he's gonna bounce back."

1640
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,051
-[Mary VO] He
was never vengeful.

1641
01:22:35,118 --> 01:22:37,186
He was certainly
never self-pitying.

1642
01:22:37,220 --> 01:22:41,890
And I remember him taking a
fair amount of responsibility.

1643
01:22:42,025 --> 01:22:46,529
He made mistakes; yeah,
he made some bad mistakes.

1644
01:22:46,562 --> 01:22:51,367
But the beauty is, when men get
older and they've lost lovers,

1645
01:22:51,400 --> 01:22:55,038
friends,
businesses, they get humble,

1646
01:22:55,038 --> 01:22:58,407
and then the best
of them comes out,

1647
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:01,410
and the best of what it
means to be a father.

1648
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:03,379
-[Jesse VO] I did
get to see him a lot more.

1649
01:23:03,412 --> 01:23:06,782
There was a transformation
emotionally in him.

1650
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,052
He knew better than
ever that family was

1651
01:23:09,085 --> 01:23:10,753
the most important thing.

So yeah, you
won't be as short

Vinton Studios was acquired by

1687
01:24:36,372 --> 01:24:39,775
Phil Knight, and subsequently

1688
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:42,645
the name was
changed to Laika.

1689
01:24:42,711 --> 01:24:46,149
There are those out there who
think that I should not be very

1690
01:24:46,149 --> 01:24:47,750
comfortable with that.

1691
01:24:47,783 --> 01:24:50,419
[laughing] So I'm gonna
set the record straight,

1692
01:24:50,453 --> 01:24:51,754
um, right here.

1693
01:24:51,787 --> 01:24:56,792
The truth is -- you know -- I
couldn't be more pleased that

1694
01:24:56,925 --> 01:25:00,163
under such strong
financial leadership,

1695
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:03,332

continue to grow and really

01:25:03,399 --> 01:25:06,202
expand on the
world of stop-motion.

1697
01:25:06,235 --> 01:25:08,171
-Need a-- need the cigar.

1698
01:25:08,171 --> 01:25:11,240
-[Will VO] For me, all of
this activity, I feel like a

1699
01:25:11,307 --> 01:25:16,078
proud father, or bastard
father in this filmmaker scene.

1700
01:25:16,679 --> 01:25:18,013
-Michele!

1701
01:25:18,046 --> 01:25:19,682
-Oh Will, thank you.

1702
01:25:19,715 --> 01:25:22,718
-[Will VO] And that's
been a continually gratifying

1703
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:26,021
aspect of this
company that we created.

1704
01:25:26,054 --> 01:25:28,891
But what pushes me and gets
me excited are -- frankly -- my

1705
01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:30,526
own projects.

1706
01:25:30,559 --> 01:25:34,863
See something else come
to life in a new way.

1707
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:41,337
One that I'm extremely excited
about is this musical project

1708
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:43,206
called 'The Kiss.'

1709
01:25:43,206 --> 01:25:46,275
I'm not a puppeteer but there's
a lot of time that a frog spends

1710
01:25:46,342 --> 01:25:48,211
just sitting there.

1711
01:25:48,244 --> 01:25:50,713
And that's one of their
charms is that they're just

1712
01:25:50,746 --> 01:25:52,448
sitting there.

1713
01:25:52,515 --> 01:25:54,783
And frogs are-- real
frogs, when they move,

1714
01:25:54,850 --> 01:25:57,253
they're sudden a lot.

1715
01:25:57,286 --> 01:25:59,755
You know, they hop or
they move or something,

1716
01:25:59,788 --> 01:26:04,793
and then their backend
is completely still again.

1717
01:26:05,794 --> 01:26:07,330
-[Melissa VO] It's an
idea that he was working on when

1718
01:26:07,363 --> 01:26:09,832
he was at the studio -- 'The
Frog Prince' -- that he wanted

1719
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:12,268
to do as a feature film.

1720
01:26:12,301 --> 01:26:17,306
Now he's metamorphosing that
to now he sees it as a musical.

1721
01:26:18,040 --> 01:26:23,045
*"Sugar Lips" by David
Pomeranz and Will Vinton*

1722
01:26:24,313 --> 01:26:26,482
-[Will VO] It's really
about all the things we've been

1723
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:27,716
talking about.

1724
01:26:27,783 --> 01:26:31,554
It's about characters and
stories and entertainment,

1725
01:26:31,620 --> 01:26:32,688
about music.

1726
01:26:32,721 --> 01:26:33,956
It's about comedy.

1727
01:26:33,989 --> 01:26:37,159
It's about great conflicts
that characters have to face.

1728
01:26:37,260 --> 01:26:41,797
***

1729
01:26:46,702 --> 01:26:50,339
As long as I'm alive, I'm
gonna keep making things.

1730
01:26:50,373 --> 01:26:51,340
I just love it.

1731
01:26:51,374 --> 01:26:53,842
I don't know what else to do.

1732
01:26:53,876 --> 01:26:54,710
It's just great fun.

1733
01:26:54,743 --> 01:26:57,713
It's just great, great fun.

1734
01:26:57,746 --> 01:27:00,283
[drips]

1735
01:27:00,316 --> 01:27:03,886
The condition I have -- it's
multiple myeloma -- is a blood

1736
01:27:03,919 --> 01:27:08,090
cancer -- blood and bone.

1737
01:27:08,724 --> 01:27:13,729
And I've sort of done in the
past is ignored and not talked

1738
01:27:13,962 --> 01:27:17,766
about health issues.

1739
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:22,605
And if you don't talk about
it, people don't pick up on it,

1740
01:27:22,638 --> 01:27:24,673
and so a lot of people -- even
good friends -- might not even

1741
01:27:24,740 --> 01:27:29,077
know that I have this condition.

1742
01:27:30,679 --> 01:27:32,781
If you did
mention it to somebody,

1743
01:27:32,815 --> 01:27:35,651
suddenly that was everything.

1744
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:38,487
It's all anybody talked about,
and it's all anybody asked you

1745
01:27:38,521 --> 01:27:40,188
about, and so forth.

1746
01:27:40,323 --> 01:27:42,991
There are so many more things
I'd rather have them ask me

1747
01:27:43,025 --> 01:27:46,595
about, like
how's-- like, you know...

1748
01:27:46,629 --> 01:27:50,333
about the lead
character in 'The Kiss...'

1749
01:27:50,333 --> 01:27:53,369
you know, how
does he really...[chuckles]

1750
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:56,004
is he really the captain of the
football team who's been

1751
01:27:56,038 --> 01:27:59,174
handicapped by being a frog?

1752
01:27:59,207 --> 01:28:02,210
I mean, that's fascinating,
that's good stuff to talk about

1753
01:28:02,345 --> 01:28:06,114
to me, but...

1754
01:28:06,181 --> 01:28:09,752
during a lot of that
time, I forget about it myself.

1755
01:28:10,686 --> 01:28:14,022
Can't forget about it now
because I'm kind of into it

1756
01:28:14,056 --> 01:28:16,859
intensely with
this new treatment,

1757
01:28:16,892 --> 01:28:19,895
so we'll see how that goes.

1758
01:28:20,696 --> 01:28:23,932
I've been a regular
for a long time, so...

1759
01:28:27,102 --> 01:28:29,872
-2006

1760
01:28:29,905 --> 01:28:33,942
-I think that Will becoming
very ill with this secret,

1761
01:28:33,976 --> 01:28:38,981
internal disease and having a
company that is also sick at the

1762
01:28:39,648 --> 01:28:44,119
same time with internal strife,
we don't know if those two

1763
01:28:44,152 --> 01:28:46,154
things are related, but
it feels like they are,

1764
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:48,156
doesn't it?

1765
01:28:48,223 --> 01:28:51,627
What would it have been like
if he had been able to say,

1766
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:55,498
"I'm scared to death"
or "I'm really angry?"

1767
01:28:59,468 --> 01:29:02,838
If I could go back in
time, I'd shake him,

1768
01:29:02,905 --> 01:29:07,175
and I'd say, "Tell me know you
really feel about all of this."

1769
01:29:07,209 --> 01:29:08,411
-[woman] Bye, Will.
-Bye-bye!

1770
01:29:08,477 --> 01:29:10,413
-[woman] Have a great week.
-See you, thanks.

1771
01:29:10,413 --> 01:29:11,847
-[woman] You're welcome.

1772
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:14,082
-[Jesse VO] Dying
was very confusing for him.

1773
01:29:14,149 --> 01:29:16,151
He would say, "If
only this was easier,

1774
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:21,189
if only I knew
kind of what to do."

1775
01:29:23,191 --> 01:29:25,861
[breathes out]

1776
01:29:25,894 --> 01:29:27,195
-I'm gonna cry.
I miss him.

1777
01:29:27,229 --> 01:29:30,032
He's my friend.

1778
01:29:30,065 --> 01:29:33,436
Thank you, Mr. Will...

1779
01:29:33,436 --> 01:29:36,539
for everything.

*slow synthesizer music

1781
01:30:00,729 --> 01:30:02,465
-[Will VO] Everything
I've done is a build.

1782
01:30:02,465 --> 01:30:03,466
There's
something that I've built,

1783
01:30:03,532 --> 01:30:06,469
one thing on top of the other.

1784
01:30:06,535 --> 01:30:10,739
I love being able to feel
like my life is a continuum.

1785
01:30:10,773 --> 01:30:13,942
That things that maybe felt like
they might have been missteps

1786
01:30:13,976 --> 01:30:15,911
was not at all a misstep.

1787
01:30:15,944 --> 01:30:19,582
***

1788
01:30:19,615 --> 01:30:22,050
-[Michele VO] Will
was an amalgam of all

1789
01:30:22,084 --> 01:30:24,820
of his characters.

1790
01:30:24,887 --> 01:30:28,824
It's almost as though you took
all that clay and you squished

1791
01:30:28,891 --> 01:30:32,495
it back together in a
big multicolored ball,

1792
01:30:32,828 --> 01:30:36,799
you'd have Will with his big
white mustache and his smile and

1793
01:30:36,832 --> 01:30:39,735
his blue eyes.

1794
01:30:39,768 --> 01:30:43,105
His work -- every time
someone discovers it --

1795
01:30:43,138 --> 01:30:48,110
that pure childhood glee
and knowing that there's magic.

1796
01:30:48,143 --> 01:30:51,614
There absolutely is magic.

1797
01:30:51,647 --> 01:30:55,450
***

1798
01:30:55,484 --> 01:30:56,985
-[Will VO] One of the
coolest things about being an

1799
01:30:57,019 --> 01:30:59,354
artist is the thought that you
can create some of these things

1800
01:30:59,421 --> 01:31:03,158
and it can go on and
live way beyond you.

1801
01:31:04,426 --> 01:31:09,532
It's all such an intense web of
human life and human existence.
