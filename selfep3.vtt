The Encounter Of Ours

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.925
(Bro, I am June.. the guy you saw this evening. Here's the video clip that Neo hit his friend.)

00:01:08.926 --> 00:01:10.926
(But please don't have to tell him that I message you ok?) 

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:32.737
Who are you?  

00:02:36.557 --> 00:02:37.986
What the fuck are you doing in my room?

00:02:46.782 --> 00:02:48.706
Err.. my name is Tang

00:02:49.955 --> 00:02:52.354
I saw you injured so I came to help..

00:02:52.966 --> 00:02:56.713
I.. saw the blood on your t-shirt and you had passed out right there!

00:02:59.928 --> 00:03:01.325
How could you see me?

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.566
I.. I am Tang..

00:03:04.848 --> 00:03:05.875
I saw you through the mirror

00:03:07.323 --> 00:03:08.008
The mirror?

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.384
What the hell???

00:03:10.908 --> 00:03:11.970
Explain that now!

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.444
well.. my reflection in the mirror disappeared

00:03:16.075 --> 00:03:17.895
And I couldn't see myself

00:03:18.256 --> 00:03:18.756
Three..

00:03:18.816 --> 00:03:20.249
And.. and I saw yours instead

00:03:20.274 --> 00:03:20.774
Two!!

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:22.587
One!!

00:03:31.051 --> 00:03:32.608
Do what you wanna do

00:03:33.101 --> 00:03:33.928
I'll leave now

00:03:54.427 --> 00:03:57.421
Your mirror looks the same as mine

00:03:58.661 --> 00:03:59.798
What you talking 'bout?

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:03.328
The reason I came here.. 

00:04:04.047 --> 00:04:05.099
Because I can not see myself

00:04:06.598 --> 00:04:07.647
But I saw you

00:04:08.004 --> 00:04:09.131
You seem to be so scared

00:04:09.858 --> 00:04:10.785
Scare of something..

00:04:11.763 --> 00:04:14.695
And then one night.. I heard you purchased the gun

00:04:16.435 --> 00:04:17.597
Did you put the spy cam in my room??

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:18.803
I didn't do anything like that at all

00:04:19.888 --> 00:04:22.484
I saw you full of blood on the floor a moment ago

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:23.379
So I am here to help

00:04:23.507 --> 00:04:24.833
I got stabbed 2 days ago

00:04:24.957 --> 00:04:26.009
How could you see a moment ago?

00:04:27.387 --> 00:04:30.944
2 days? 2 days what? I just..

00:04:31.053 --> 00:04:33.040
You are one of the guys who thought I killed P'Fei right??

00:04:33.311 --> 00:04:34.285
What's wrong with you

00:04:34.561 --> 00:04:36.099
I told you I didn't do it!

00:04:36.518 --> 00:04:37.731
The police had the evidence!

00:04:38.011 --> 00:04:40.011
You are those fans of p'Fei, aren't you?

00:04:45.319 --> 00:04:46.770
HELP PLEASE!!!!

00:04:50.461 --> 00:04:53.941
What's happening?? / What're you guys doing?

00:04:55.501 --> 00:04:56.774
Get off me!

00:04:57.082 --> 00:04:58.009
Don't let him.

00:04:58.394 --> 00:05:00.022
What's the matter?

00:05:00.871 --> 00:05:02.524
Let go of me!

00:05:03.264 --> 00:05:03.764
Let go!

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:04.480
He has a gun??

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.930
Let me go!

00:05:09.956 --> 00:05:10.649
Hey guys..

00:05:10.726 --> 00:05:11.453
What?

00:05:11.826 --> 00:05:12.995
I'm really appreciate your help, sir

00:05:13.015 --> 00:05:13.740
Hmm?

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:15.869
You guys are really really nice..

00:05:15.921 --> 00:05:16.524
What?

00:05:16.631 --> 00:05:18.360
Can I post the video clip of you guys on the internet?

00:05:19.217 --> 00:05:20.215
Video clip?

00:05:20.868 --> 00:05:23.646
Umm.. actually, we're doing the PRANK, sir

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:24.980
Wait what? / Seriously?

00:05:25.118 --> 00:05:26.852
I'm really sorry, sir. The camera is right there..

00:05:27.453 --> 00:05:29.453
Oh.. It's just a prank

00:05:29.754 --> 00:05:30.254
Yes, sir.

00:05:30.698 --> 00:05:31.207
I thought it was true!

00:05:31.281 --> 00:05:34.284
I apologize to you guys.. and this is my gun

00:05:34.747 --> 00:05:37.548
Did you suppose to have a gun?

00:05:41.623 --> 00:05:45.123
Don't do the prank like that no more!

00:05:46.643 --> 00:05:49.623
It's dangerous

00:05:53.428 --> 00:05:57.552
You wanna die huh? I told you I didn't do it!

00:06:00.481 --> 00:06:03.570
So.. you didn't do anything to your friend?

00:06:05.573 --> 00:06:06.742
Then, how come you got stabbed?

00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:13.906
Umm.. Did you really get stabbed 2 days ago?

00:06:15.153 --> 00:06:16.105
Not this evening?

00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:22.107
And who will you use this gun with?

00:06:24.408 --> 00:06:26.524
I'm planning to do anything with that gun

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.575
I just have it for my protectio

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:31.310
Can you give me back?

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:32.892
Whao.. whao..

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:36.578
I heard you said that you were going to kill someone

00:06:38.068 --> 00:06:39.277
How did you hear me?

00:06:39.618 --> 00:06:41.618
Through the mirror, I've told you already.

00:06:42.522 --> 00:06:43.536
Yeah.. funny

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:45.020
I'm serious

00:06:46.158 --> 00:06:48.543
If you don't believe me, then you should come to Chiang Mai.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.637
Then, you will see that I tell you the truth.

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:56.360
How should I go there with you?

00:06:57.324 --> 00:06:59.324
I don't even know anything about you.

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:02.649
I came here empty-handed

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.349
How can I do anything to see?

00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:09.918
Who knows?

00:07:11.071 --> 00:07:11.788
But let me ask you frankly..

00:07:13.236 --> 00:07:16.493
If you didn't come to do anything to me.. why were you here?

00:07:17.296 --> 00:07:19.226
I told you I saw you in the mirror

00:07:19.772 --> 00:07:21.198
and I was curious how it relates between you and me

00:07:23.387 --> 00:07:25.663
Besides, I saw you covered in blood that's why I came to help

00:07:26.013 --> 00:07:28.058
You aim the gun at me, instead.

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:34.706
I really want to know..

00:07:35.536 --> 00:07:36.768
what you gonna do with the gun?

00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:38.928
I'm not gonna use it for the bad reason tho

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:43.811
if that's so.. I suppose that you don't need it, right?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.452
Shall you want it back.. then come find me in Chiang Mai

00:07:51.166 --> 00:07:52.467
so you could believe that I'm telling you the truth.

00:07:55.085 --> 00:07:55.950
What a weird guy you are!

00:08:07.295 --> 00:08:09.319
I'll go now. Hit me up okay?

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:14.107
You look fine.. so there's nothing to be worried about

00:08:16.121 --> 00:08:17.148
See you around.

00:09:28.269 --> 00:09:31.841
Show me the chord of "Just Improvise" band.

00:09:32.224 --> 00:09:33.062
What song?

00:09:33.062 --> 00:09:34.925
Klua jeeb ther mai tan (Afraid of losing you to others)

00:09:35.085 --> 00:09:35.912
Hey guys

00:09:38.407 --> 00:09:40.620
I'm sorry that I bailed on you guys yesterday.

00:09:47.538 --> 00:09:50.294
After school, I'll livestream in our fan page 

00:09:51.263 --> 00:09:54.041
that this song is produced by you and me

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.971
Also.. I will promote out band

00:10:03.911 --> 00:10:07.971
It's kinda weird tho. If the band named "TangMay", 
but there's only Tang who's on the screen.

00:10:14.409 --> 00:10:14.909
Or..

00:10:15.443 --> 00:10:18.562
Do a busking livestream outdoor like Nam-mei said she wanted to do..

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.898
as a "Tang-May band"

00:10:28.997 --> 00:10:29.757
You guys!

00:10:30.224 --> 00:10:32.419
I'll do anything to apologize.

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:35.238
I just want to show you guys how sincere I am of saying sorry.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:42.953
Your hair is a mess again. Are you still have that "artist phobia"?

00:10:43.301 --> 00:10:46.404
Please brush hair or at least check yourself in the mirror.

00:10:50.453 --> 00:10:54.871
Umm.. actually I okay with your livestream idea. Then, it's all up to May.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.650
No..

00:11:03.417 --> 00:11:06.417
I won't forgive you if you don't let me play my guitar solos.

00:11:08.155 --> 00:11:11.335
Dude!! I'm so panic since you didn’t say boo to me!

00:11:11.852 --> 00:11:13.852
I thought I've lost you guys

00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:16.758
Yeah we have to acting big. I'm just putting on airs.

00:11:16.899 --> 00:11:18.455
Nam-mei always annoys me. 

00:11:18.579 --> 00:11:19.079
Hmm?

00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:21.491
She keeps begging me to be reunited with you.

00:11:22.376 --> 00:11:23.078
Are you pleased?

00:11:24.205 --> 00:11:28.289
Yeah like.. a lot! So you guys gonna livestream this evening right?

00:11:29.268 --> 00:11:31.463
Yup.. what do you think?

00:11:34.443 --> 00:11:36.956
I think I was born to play with you ha!

00:11:40.254 --> 00:11:42.618
So... we're okay then? / Of course

00:11:42.776 --> 00:11:44.023
I'm really sorry, dude

00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:46.362
Let's play some / Yeah keep practicing 

00:11:46.362 --> 00:11:49.314
You do the strumming then I will hit the chord.

00:11:49.314 --> 00:11:50.515
Duo? Yeahh

00:11:51.609 --> 00:11:53.210
One.. two.. three.. go

on this facebook fan page, see you guys soon! 😄✨🎸) 

00:12:46.421 --> 00:12:48.421
CancelNeoWiangPunya : 🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻🖕🏻

00:12:48.449 --> 00:12:50.115
(You will have to pay for what you did!)

00:12:50.115 --> 00:12:51.788
(We will not let p'Fei die for free)

00:12:51.837 --> 00:12:55.617
(You'll be cancelled and outcast from this society! you bastards)

00:12:55.617 --> 00:12:58.394
(We hope you die tortured than P'Fei!)

00:14:05.209 --> 00:14:07.209
(Yesterday, you told me to come see you)

00:14:07.209 --> 00:14:09.209
(I'll go there and meet you in Chiang Mai)

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.911
Hey Tang! / What? / Just check yourself for god's sake

00:14:36.235 --> 00:14:37.454
Wait what are you doing?

00:14:38.024 --> 00:14:40.548
Stay still.. you didn't spread your sunscreen cream good enough.

00:14:40.653 --> 00:14:42.716
Look at you.. damn

00:14:46.103 --> 00:14:49.664
Umm.. this is so soft

00:14:51.218 --> 00:14:52.369
this absorbs really fast

00:14:54.635 --> 00:14:56.460
What's the brand?

00:15:01.181 --> 00:15:03.120
The fuck? you pose for what?

00:15:04.032 --> 00:15:05.301
Duh 

00:15:05.581 --> 00:15:07.024
Duh! go get yourself prepared pls

00:15:21.632 --> 00:15:22.310
Nah it's fine

00:15:28.484 --> 00:15:32.480
(Yesterday, you told me to come see you)
(I'll go there and meet you in Chiang Mai)

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:34.100
Umm you guys

00:15:35.333 --> 00:15:36.909
There's my bro coming here

00:15:37.921 --> 00:15:38.424
Can he stay?

00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:42.466
That's seem to be no problem to me.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:45.295
Is that the guy from Lamphun.. oops

00:15:46.779 --> 00:15:47.955
A guy from Lamphun?

00:15:48.965 --> 00:15:50.271
Wait.. what? When did you have a BRO?

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.145
Just prepare for the livestream

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:55.056
Stop keeping fun of me

00:15:56.429 --> 00:15:59.494
Yeah yeah, I've always been ready, boss.

00:16:02.361 --> 00:16:07.302
(June : P'Tang, have you seen this? There is a proof that Neo kill P'Fei)

00:16:15.532 --> 00:16:17.825
No camera please, stop please!

00:16:18.142 --> 00:16:21.308
Eww... a lot of blood in his head

00:16:21.573 --> 00:16:23.752
What's wrong with that student?

00:16:23.752 --> 00:16:25.074
Who's inside that abandon building?

00:16:25.272 --> 00:16:27.300
Who's that / Is he alive?

00:16:27.573 --> 00:16:28.429
Blood all over his body

00:16:28.429 --> 00:16:29.493
He dead?

00:16:31.978 --> 00:16:32.590
Guys! just a sec..

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:35.145
And go to LIVE already!

00:16:35.561 --> 00:16:40.901
Hello! everyone. We are "TangMay" !!

00:16:41.551 --> 00:16:43.940
Today, we gonna play the song that we wrote together.

00:16:44.283 --> 00:16:45.834
It's named "Art Ja Pen (Maybe)"

00:16:47.113 --> 00:16:49.322
Let's go!

00:16:49.758 --> 00:16:50.258
You can do it!

00:17:17.049 --> 00:17:18.161
I couldn't see myself

00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:19.129
Three..

00:17:19.617 --> 00:17:20.739
I saw your reflection instead

00:17:20.867 --> 00:17:21.426
Two

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:23.869
About.. Neo who killed a senior of my school?

00:17:24.308 --> 00:17:24.808
You die!

00:17:24.816 --> 00:17:25.316
One..

00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.871
Hey!!!

00:17:36.686 --> 00:17:37.725
What the fuck is going on???

00:17:45.358 --> 00:17:48.369
Self, I see you 

00:17:49.192 --> 00:17:53.238

I'm not sure if I could ask you this, but..

00:17:56.002 --> 00:17:57.617
I want to know what really happened..

00:17:57.618 --> 00:18:00.581
Well, I first met Fei at Athletics club.

00:18:01.043 --> 00:18:02.153
Hey

00:18:02.154 --> 00:18:04.154
Is this Fei's boyfriend?.. or a girlfriend?

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:06.266
Hahahahaha

00:18:07.222 --> 00:18:08.178
Neo..

00:18:08.885 --> 00:18:10.644
Why did you tell me to come here?

00:18:10.790 --> 00:18:14.306
After everything I did, couldn't it even conquer your heart??

00:18:14.307 --> 00:18:16.307
Did I ask you to do so??

00:18:16.493 --> 00:18:19.239
Leave me alone, this is what I ask you for.
