00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.040
You're constantly checking your phone the whole day.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.750
Eh? I guess you have a crush on someone.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.180
It's just about work. I went in for a casting call for a music video.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.840
Okay, if you say so.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.400
But if you like someone, you can talk to me.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.550
I want to know who manages to win a heart of a perfect man like you?

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.370
Why do you want to know?

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.800
Let's talk about you. You haven't found anyone to go to the Awards Ceremony with, right?

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.820
I can recommend someone to you.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.180
No, thanks.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.680
I don't want to go out with someone I don't know well enough.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.040
I don't want to be fake.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.460
Actually, I was planning to go alone from the beginning.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.570
Here, do you want some?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:01.400
Thank you.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.260
Are you sure that this is going to work?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.280
Can we come up with a new plan that is safer?

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.550
I'll head straight to her.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:12.620
When I almost hit her, I will swerve my motorcycle.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.330
I won't let her get hurt.

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.660
You guys should get going.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.020
Get ready to be a hero.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.950
Go!

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.510
She's coming!

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.280
Shit!

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.170
My egg tarts!

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.480
I'm disappointed. I thought you bought it for me because you knew I like it.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.530
It's probably one of your fans who gave it to you.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.550
It's so good to be famous. People buy you many things.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.770
But that also means I have to sacrifice my private time for that.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.060
(Mook)

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.080
Can I take a picture with you?

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.110
Of course.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:40.930
Are you alright?

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.180
Are you guys okay?

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.080
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.044
I'm fine.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.310
But...

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.720
Your arm.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.620
Lucky you that the nurse didn't go back yet.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:17.420
Er... I'm sorry for what happened.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.910
What did you just say?

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.110
I'm sorry that you got hurt because of me.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.710
Can you go back home by yourself?

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.370
Even if I can't,

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.200
I have to endure it.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.260
It's quite painful.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.800
It's inconvenient to be unable to do all the small things.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.510
Also...

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.640
Fine.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.480
I'll send you home.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.420
So, where is your house?

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.170
My parents are out of town.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.820
So I'm staying alone at the condo.

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.680
Also, tomrrow is weekend.

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.640
I'm thinking that...

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.150
What is it?

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:12.930
It must be nice if someone around here wants to make up for his mistake by helping me clean my wound.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.510
Are you in a lot of pain? Thank you so much for helping him.

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.800
You got hurt because of him.

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.260
It's not his fault.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.820
It was an accident.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.550
Actually, I have to thank you...

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.860
for letting me bother you again.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.350
You're not bothering us at all. Feel free to come here anytime you want.

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.130
No one's at home during the weekend, right?

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.770
You arm hurts as well.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.660
It must be inconvenient for you.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.660
Q, help him out.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:09.510
Here.

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:13.710
I help you because you helped me.

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:17.460
Hurry up and eat so you can go home.

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:33.710
I'd better go now, Mom.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:35.040
Goodbye, Uncle Man.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:37.460
Thank you so much. The food is really good!

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.460
You're welcome.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:43.000
Q, make sure he arrives home safely. Don't just walk him to the main street.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.540
Alright. I know that.

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:47.880
Hurry back. It's getting late.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.710
Or do you want me to send him home instead?

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:53.680
He's just kidding.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:57.130
Let's go.

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.340
Hey! Listen to me.

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.840
Don't mess with your nephew's friend.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.140
I know, Sis!

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.570
I know who's mine and who's my nephew's.

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.060
Do you think what I'm scared of will actually happen?

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.020
Sis, why do you have to worry?

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.900
It's not like he's addicted to drugs or killed someone.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.040
Let him make his own decision.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:33.110
But... It's hard for me to accept it.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.110
Listen to me.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:40.580
You've raised him and me.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.260
You're the one who always protects me.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.460
You make me feel happy being myself.

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:47.750
But...

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.110
I know how painful it is when your parents can't accept the way we are.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.220
Let's get inside.

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:15.060
I can just drop you off downstairs. Why do you want me to come up here?

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.820
Just in case you will come tomorrow to help me clean my wound,

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.800
you will not go to the wrong room.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.550
Here. A spare key card.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.530
So you won't get into trouble with the security guards.

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:32.840
Take it.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.170
Fine.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.000
You're worried that I won't come?

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:41.150
Well... Is there anything you want to eat?

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.110
I'll buy it before I come here.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.440
Just order anything you want to eat.

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:46.860
I think...

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.150
The food doesn't matter.

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.770
What matters is who you're eating with.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.600
That's so lame.

00:07:58.220 --> 00:08:00.680
You're living alone like this,

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.620
don't you feel lonely?

00:08:04.170 --> 00:08:05.200
I'm already used to it.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.260
It was more lonely when I moved abroad and went to boarding school.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.370
I couldn't talk to anyone.

00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.370
If it was me, I don't think I could survive.

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.680
I think I might die because of boredom.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.730
But I think being alone is not bad

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.620
when you have someone to think about.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.150
Okay, okay.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.200
So, is there anything else you want?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:31.570
There is.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:34.600
I want to know why you're not...

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.460
What is it?

00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:40.200
Nothing.

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:42.260
What's wrong with you?

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.580
I'm going back home now.

00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.000
Why you're not reading my message or texting me back?

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.080
Hello, Mom. I'll stay at the condo this week.

00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.370
Okay, sure.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.480
Love you, Mom.

00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:17.350
Who called me?

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.260
Toy, what's up?

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:34.570
Video call me later.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.880
Let me take a shower first.

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:39.950
They've sent me a lot of text messages.

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:42.910
X texted me too.

00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.640
Are you awake?

00:09:47.170 --> 00:09:48.840
Don't forget to eat breakfast.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:51.480
Say hi to your mom and Uncle Man for me.

00:09:52.550 --> 00:09:54.420
Is there anything I can help?

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.350
Do you want me to introduce you to Mook?

00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.155
I'm sorry. 

00:10:00.155 --> 00:10:02.150
(I'm sorry. I forgot my phone at home today)

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:16.680
Q, are you still in one piece?

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:20.800
Don't try to be funny. I'm blessed to still be alive today.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:25.680
Lucky you that X helped you just in time.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.460
By the way,

00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.600
is he alright?

00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:34.060
You fell on him like that. I don't think he could get up anymore.

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:38.020
He's wounded too, right? I think he must be in pain now.

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.400
Maybe he might have a fever too.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:45.370
I don't think he was badly injured.

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:47.110
Don't try to make me feel guilty.

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:51.000
He seemed alright when I sent him home.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.710
He looked fine.

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.220
I'm not trying to make you feel guilty.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.080
The girl that almost hit you and X was a medical student that tutors me.

00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:59.620
That's what people said.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:05.800
I guess all those scenes in dramas are so fake.

00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.260
Frank,

00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:11.000
why did your tutor come to our school?

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:13.170
She came to pick up Mook.

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:16.510
I think you don't stand a chance, Q.

00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:20.550
What should we do now?

00:11:21.330 --> 00:11:23.660
Our "Super Hero" plan already failed.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:26.480
What a pity.

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:28.550
Mook doesn't like boys?

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.770
You can't be sure.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.950
She just answered me.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:39.730
Thank you for the egg tarts.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:41.260
Hey!

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:44.110
That means we still have hope

00:11:44.110 --> 00:11:47.350
Q, you should text her now.

00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:52.770
You should find out whether she talks to you because she's just being polite or because she's interested in you.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:53.770
That's right.

00:11:54.930 --> 00:11:57.950
Toy, you know her schedule, right?

00:11:58.480 --> 00:11:59.330
I do.

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.370
I think Q should give her something which shows that he's caring and has good intentions.

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:05.260
What do you think?

00:12:05.730 --> 00:12:07.130
I think that's a good idea.

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.350
Q!

00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:14.860
Q!

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.130
Er... I...

00:12:17.510 --> 00:12:19.660
I have something to do this weekend.

00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.840
Please take care of it for me.

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:26.130
Toy, if you want to buy something, just pay for it first.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.260
Frank, please answer the chat for me.

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.570
Okay? I have to go now.

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.460
Mom! I'm going out for a while.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.530
Where are you going? It's so late now!

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:47.750
I will go to give medicine to X.

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.860
You can go tomorrow. Look at the time.

00:12:52.310 --> 00:12:53.750
You should let him rest.

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:56.950
You just left him a few moments ago.

00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.200
You've been running around for the whole day.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.130
Aren't you tired?

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:03.880
But X might get sick.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.240
Did he look okay before you left him?

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.570
Yeah.

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:15.310
Did he say that his body aches or hurts?

00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:19.370
Or did he feel like he wanted to vomit or dizzy?

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.460
No.

00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:25.820
Well then, you should go back to bed.

00:13:27.150 --> 00:13:29.310
And if you're so worried about him,

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:33.280
this world has an invention called the telephone.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.330
You can call and ask him.

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:38.880
Mom!

00:13:56.750 --> 00:13:57.620
Sis.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:00.280
You're not worried anymore, right?

00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:02.730
(Day 3)

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.240
I'm surprised that you came here so early.

00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:26.620
You think this is early? It's already 10 a.m.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:29.910
But this is the earliest time I can come.

00:14:31.910 --> 00:14:33.060
I have to help my mom pack the products.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.000
I took Aspirin last night.

00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:37.500
So I had a long night's sleep.

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:42.300
Thank you for keeping your promise.

00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.710
You can stop talking politely to me.

00:14:47.050 --> 00:14:49.020
It feels weird.

00:14:49.330 --> 00:14:50.310
Why is that?

00:14:51.370 --> 00:14:54.200
It's too formal and unfriendly.

00:14:54.660 --> 00:14:56.700
How should I talk to you then?

00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:59.330
Do we have to show that we're close by calling each other...

00:15:00.330 --> 00:15:03.800
dude, dork, jerk, etc.?

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.000
Something like that?

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.130
Sure. I don't mind.

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.350
If I'm close to your mom and Uncle Man,

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:13.770
can I use those words with them too?

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.220
That's not what I mean.

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:19.860
Whatever.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:22.750
I don't want to fight anymore. Just talk however you want.

00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.020
Maybe because I grew up abroad,

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.860
they don't have level of pronoun politeness.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:29.840
Because everyone is equal.

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:34.420
Also, when you're angry or hate someone,

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:36.400
you will use rude words to call them.

00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:41.750
So why do I have to use those rude words with someone I don't hate?

00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:48.930
Okay, okay. Do whatever you want.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.910
If you're not used to how I talk,

00:15:51.730 --> 00:15:53.020
I can just call you Q.

00:15:55.770 --> 00:15:59.100
You're getting on my nerves.

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:02.330
Wait.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.950
Go wash your face and brush your teeth first.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.280
Can I eat it first?

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:10.220
- I'm sick.
- Get up.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:12.730
Just go!

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.970
You can eat it later.

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:17.370
Three scenes for you.

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:17.860
Okay.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.350
After the lighting and camera are ready, I'll let you know.

00:16:20.570 --> 00:16:22.000
Sure. Thank you so much.

00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.080
Mook.

00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:27.820
Mook.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:39.130
Oh! It's you!

00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:43.570
You remember me?

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.440
Of course! We're in the same school.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:51.510
Also...

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:54.170
You're on the school basketball team.

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.620
Also...

00:16:58.470 --> 00:17:00.480
You're so bad at aerobic dancing.

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.420
You saw that?

00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:07.330
I must be blind if I didn't see you.

00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:09.600
You ruined the whole class.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:13.240
Who is he?

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:16.660
What's your problem?

00:17:17.770 --> 00:17:19.240
Er... I...

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:19.840
Wait.

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:22.150
You are...

00:17:23.330 --> 00:17:24.640
That dude who rode a motorcycle.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.640
Yes...

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.860
Well, I...

00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.710
Mind, stop teasing him.

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:33.940
This is Mind. She's my sister.

00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:38.060
Sister!

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:43.080
Hello! I heard you are a tutor, right?

00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.080
You tutor my friend.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:46.510
You're in the same gang as Frank?

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:47.480
That's right!

00:17:48.340 --> 00:17:50.000
I have to tutor him later.

00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:52.370
I have to go first.

00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:54.530
- Okay.
- Be nice to each other. I'll pick you up later.

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:56.170
Of course.

00:17:56.170 --> 00:17:58.770
Bye-bye. Drive safely.

00:18:01.570 --> 00:18:04.540
Why do you come here to see me?

00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:11.260
I...

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.860
My friend asks me to give you this.

00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.800
Oh, Q!

00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.460
He gave me this yesterday too.

00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.150
That's right.

00:18:21.730 --> 00:18:24.420
Please tell him I say thank you.

00:18:25.130 --> 00:18:26.060
I will.

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:31.370
You can give it to me when you see me at school next time.

00:18:31.770 --> 00:18:32.770
You don't have to hide.

00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:33.880
Well...

00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.240
My friend, Q, is a shy person.

00:18:41.350 --> 00:18:42.640
It's time.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.080
I have to get back to work.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:49.930
Talk to you later.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:53.170
Okay!

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.020
Yes!
