It's scary but with complex emotional

00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,069
Yeah, this I know.

163
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:22,490
Shit.

164
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,787
[line ringing]

165
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:32,333
-[Wes] Sam?
-Hey. What's going on?

166
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,130
Uh, Tara... was attacked.

167
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,175
What? Is she--

168
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:42,844
She's alive, but in bad shape.

169
00:12:44,012 --> 00:12:46,639
She was... stabbed.

170
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,267
Stabbed? What the fuck?

171
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:52,145
She made it through surgery,
and the doctor said it went well.

172
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,772
She's resting now.

173
00:12:53,855 --> 00:12:55,815
I know you guys
aren't on the best terms, but--

174
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,483
I'm on my way.

175
00:12:57,567 --> 00:13:00,236
She's gonna be okay, Sam.
We'll see you soon.

176
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,821
Hey, wait. Wes...

177
00:13:01,905 --> 00:13:02,906
Yeah?

178
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,909
Do they know who did this?

179
00:13:06,743 --> 00:13:09,454
<i>It's probably better
if you just come here.</i>

180
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:10,664
Wes.

181
00:13:11,331 --> 00:13:14,208
She said it was someone
in a fucking Ghostface mask.

182
00:13:16,461 --> 00:13:18,296
[phone beeps]

183
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,718
My sister was attacked.

184
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:26,513
I gotta go.

185
00:13:26,596 --> 00:13:29,390
Wait, hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm going with you.

186
00:13:29,474 --> 00:13:30,683
No. No, Richie--

187
00:13:30,767 --> 00:13:33,561
No, no, Sam. I'm coming with you.

188
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,814
-Okay.
-Okay. Yeah.

[person over PA] Attention, Panthers.

190
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:43,738
A reminder that all classes
and school activities

191
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,699
are canceled tomorrow
due to public-safety concerns.

192
00:13:46,783 --> 00:13:47,825
That was Sam.

193
00:13:47,909 --> 00:13:49,619
She's coming?

194
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:50,704
Yeah.

195
00:13:51,496 --> 00:13:53,164
Watch everything get worse.

196
00:13:53,248 --> 00:13:56,000
Listen, all I'm saying is,
with everything going on now,

197
00:13:56,084 --> 00:14:00,379
I think it's time we take our relationship
to the next, most intimate level.

198
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:02,841
He wants me to accept
his Find My Fam request.

199
00:14:02,924 --> 00:14:05,927
It's the smartest option
with a would-be killer on the loose.

200
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,513
You know exactly where I am,
and I know exactly where you are.

201
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:10,432
Aw, you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend.

202
00:14:10,515 --> 00:14:12,350
And you can stalk me
like a jealous boyfriend.

203
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,687
[mock gag] Is this because
you two aren't having sex yet?

204
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,273
You actually bring up a very good point.
Not that I want to sound

205
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:21,026
like the stereotypical jock
trying to get into his girlfriend's pants.

206
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:22,777
-Great!
-Don't do it, Liv.

207
00:14:22,861 --> 00:14:25,280
There's a psycho out there.
Make yourself harder to find.

208
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:28,033
Delete social media,
tape over your phone camera, disable GPS.

209
00:14:28,116 --> 00:14:30,701
Yes, thank you very much, Edward Snowden.

210
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,747
Actually, your mother just interrogated me
about Tara's attempted murder,

211
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,081
which was very fun.

212
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:39,085
I'm sure she's asking everybody.
I mean, Ghostface is back.

213
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,670
The press still isn't saying Ghostface.

214
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,130
My mom doesn't want to cause a panic.

215
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:44,007
It'll get out by the second
or third killing.

216
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:48,011
Jesus, Mindy. There wasn't
a first killing. Tara's alive.

217
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,013
Mm, that means she could still die.

218
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:52,307
-What the fuck?
-Or the killer could come back for her.

219
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:53,517
Fuck! Mindy, come on.

220
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,520
I'm just telling you, arm up, okay?
Pepper spray, check. Taser, check.

221
00:14:57,604 --> 00:15:00,064
-Girlfriend repellent, check.
-[all chuckle]

222
00:15:00,148 --> 00:15:01,649
Nice. Thank you.

223
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:04,944
Oh, shit. Is that... Vince?

224
00:15:06,029 --> 00:15:08,448
Wait, the creep
you hooked up with last summer?

225
00:15:09,032 --> 00:15:12,577
-Yeah, he worked with me and Tara.
-He worked with Tara?

226
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,413
He's been stalking my Instagram
the last couple weeks,

227
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,874
posting the creepiest shit.

228
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,835
Probably time to introduce him
to Hobbs and Shaw.

229
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:24,589
Maybe not the best idea to incite
violence right in front of the sheriff.

230
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:26,841
Looks like he's leaving.

231
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,927
Thanks anyways, boys.

232
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,094
Yeah, mm-hmm.

233
00:15:30,178 --> 00:15:31,554
-[vehicle engine starts]
-Hmm.

234
00:15:31,638 --> 00:15:34,807
Tara says she fought back hard.
You've got bruises.

235
00:15:34,891 --> 00:15:36,267
It's from football practice.

236
00:15:36,351 --> 00:15:38,728
-Oh, sure.
-Tara's awake. She just texted.

237
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:42,357
-I'm going to the hospital. You coming?
-Yeah.

238
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:46,111
Oh, uh, I can't,
but I'll meet you guys later.

239
00:15:46,194 --> 00:15:47,570
All right.

240
00:15:57,497 --> 00:16:00,333
-I've actually never seen Stab.
-You've never seen Sfab?

241
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,294
-Mm-hmm.
-Not even the one that came out last year?

242
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:05,380
I've never seen Gone With the Wind either,

243
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:09,009
but I don't consider it a huge hole
in my cinematic education.

244
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:12,428
<i>Most of the Stab movies
are based on things that happened here.</i>

245

Define "things."

246
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,016
Things like...

247
00:16:16,099 --> 00:16:20,394
a guy named Billy Loomis and his friend
carved up a bunch of high-school kids

248
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,064
while wearing this Halloween ghost mask.

249
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,774
You mean like in Halloween?

250
00:16:25,984 --> 00:16:28,236
-No. Not like in Halloween.
-Oh.

251
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:30,905
Sounds a lot like Halloween.

252
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:33,366
-All right, it's a little like Halloween.
-Okay.

253
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,370
And every decade or so,
some idiot gets the bright idea

254
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,290
to put on the mask, kill his friends,
and get famous too.

255
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:42,583
The last time it happened was in 2011.

256
00:16:42,667 --> 00:16:44,585
And we came here voluntarily?

257
00:16:44,669 --> 00:16:47,338
Well, I got to make sure Tara's okay.

258
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:48,714
Yes, of course.

259

And I got to make sure
we don't get sliced up by some lunatic

"You know what?

Yeah.

264
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,355
Do you have any idea why

265
00:17:03,438 --> 00:17:06,566
someone wearing that mask
would want to kill your sister?

Yeah, for all of ten minutes.

287
00:18:15,635 --> 00:18:19,972
Uh, look, guys, Tara's really tired.
Maybe we should just give her some space.

-Yeah.
-Yeah.

Not you, Sam.

- Want you to stay.
-Okay.

-But the rest...
-Yeah.

I could sleep here tonight.

You only say that because she let you
wear Pokémon onesies to bed for a year.

right out when Tara's eight, Sam's 13.

309
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:31,502
Sam started acting out,
getting in trouble with the cops.

310

And then, on Sam's 18th birthday,
she leaves.

Maybe Sam's changed.
I just don't want to see Tara hurt again.

So what, you're protecting Tara
from her own sister now?

Well, someone has to.

Okay, so no guys are good enough for her,
and now her family's off-limits too?

-We all know you have a crush on Tara.

318
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,695
Okay. Come on, Mindy.

319
00:19:57,779 --> 00:19:59,655
But we're all suspects.

320
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,826
Hmm?

321
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,870
-Except maybe Liv.
-Thank you.

322
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,958
-You're way too boring to be a psycho.
-Yo, Liv. You want a real drink?

323
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,710
Or are you happy sitting
at this kids' table?

324

Listen up, Uglier Michael Myers,
it was a summer fling. It meant nothing.

325
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,925
-Was I talking to you?
- I don't care who you're talking to.

326
00:20:19,008 --> 00:20:20,551
-Liv, let's go.
-Don't talk to her!

327
00:20:20,635 --> 00:20:22,386
- I don't want to hear your voice.
-Shut your mouth.

328
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,762
-Better shut the fuck up.
-Hey!

329
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:26,140
Get out of here, or I'm calling the cops.

330
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,684
Go!

331
00:20:27,767 --> 00:20:30,019
-I'll see you soon, sweetheart.
-Hey, man, fuck you.

I'm just trying to help.

Who is this?

Someone who knows
your little family secret.

You're the fuck who hurt my sister?

Somebody tried to kill me
in the break room!

383
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:48,277
I've got a body outside a bar on Main,
and then you get attacked here.

384
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,196
You said the call came
from Amber's number?

385
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:53,156
So”? We know he cloned my phone
before when he attacked Tara.

386
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:57,741
Or-- and, um, I'm just spitballing here--
you're the Killer.

387
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,038
And where were you when all this happened?

388
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:03,042
I was... watching Netflix.

389
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,546
-Ooh, yeah. Super-solid alibi, bro.
-So where were you?

390
00:25:06,629 --> 00:25:09,048
I was questioning Amber and her friends
at the sheriff's station.

391
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,716
Yeah, I came as soon as I heard.

392
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,343
But, you know,
the Netflix alibi is good too.

393
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:13,428
Both of you, stop it.

394
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,429
You're gonna put more cops
on her room, right?

395
00:25:15,513 --> 00:25:16,514
Yes.

396
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,933
And I can move you to a private floor.

397
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,185
Deputy Vinson knows what he's doing.
You'll be safe.

398
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,436
Like we've been so far?

399
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:25,981
Samantha, let's step outside.

400
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,238
Nice to see you, Deputy Hicks.

401
00:25:32,905 --> 00:25:35,490
-So many fun memories.
-It's "Sheriff' Hicks.

402
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:37,326
I remember you too,

403
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:40,537
and all the trouble
you used to cause your family.

404
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,249
Your presence here is not helping.

405
00:25:43,332 --> 00:25:46,793
So maybe when the sun comes up,
you and your boyfriend can hit the road

406
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,672
and leave it to people
who actually care about this community.

407
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,728
Well, she remains a delight.

408
00:26:04,812 --> 00:26:06,355
Are you okay?

409
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,442
Um, would you mind giving us a second?
I need to talk to Tara.

410
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,570
-Come on, Netflix. Let's go.
-[scoffs]

411
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,713
Do you remember when Dad left?

412
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:33,341
Parts, sure.

413
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,012
I was eight. I don't know
what that has to do with anything.

414
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,222
It has to do with it.

415
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:47,896
Do you remember how Mom used to
keep those boxes up in the attic?

416
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,025
Well, I was up there once--

417
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,903
When I was 13,
looking for Christmas presents.

418
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:58,658
And I found these old diaries
that she kept from high school.

419
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:00,200
-Sam, what is--
-Please.

420
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:01,827
I have to do this.

421
00:27:02,453 --> 00:27:04,163
So I found these old diaries.

422
00:27:04,872 --> 00:27:07,833
And I knew it was wrong,
but I read some anyway

423
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,210
because Mom got pregnant
with me in high school,

424
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:13,547
and I thought it could be cool to find out
how she and Dad got together.

425
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:15,424
How romantic it must have been.

426
00:27:16,592 --> 00:27:17,718
So I read some.

427
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,097
Only it wasn't romantic.

428
00:27:23,182 --> 00:27:25,058
Mom was dating Dad, but...

429
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,646
she was in love with this other guy,

430
00:27:29,272 --> 00:27:30,815
and he got her pregnant.

431
00:27:31,774 --> 00:27:34,568
She told Dad it was his,
and that's why he proposed senior year.

432
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:38,489
-Sam, what are you talking about?
-And I'm sitting there, in this attic,

433
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:40,032
and I'm 13,

434
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,828
and I just found out my dad isn't my dad.

435
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,583
So I go find Mom in her bedroom,
and I'm screaming at her

436
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,837
and shoving this diary in her face,

437
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:57,420
and I didn't even realize
that Dad was standing right behind me.

438
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,095
[sighs] He didn't know.

439
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,017
He found out right then from me.

440
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:11,355
He left that night.

441
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,150
I'm the reason he left.

442
00:28:14,233 --> 00:28:16,151
No. No, Sam--

443
00:28:16,235 --> 00:28:18,237
Mom never forgave me.

444
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:22,116
Then she made me promise never
to tell you because you were so young.

445
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,494
And that's why I changed,

446
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:29,873
and I got distant and weird with you.

447
00:28:31,959 --> 00:28:36,459
And I went out and I started doing
every drug that I could get my hands on

448
00:28:37,381 --> 00:28:40,425
until I couldn't take it anymore,
and I left town.

449
00:28:40,509 --> 00:28:43,345
I just couldn't be around you
anymore, Tara.

450
00:28:43,429 --> 00:28:46,932
Not only because I destroyed our family
that night, but because

451
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,519
those diaries told me
who my real father was.

452
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,858
It was Billy Loomis.

453
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,112
And somebody knows,
and I think that's why you got hurt.

454
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:03,866
And I'm so fucking sorry that
I never told you, and then I ran away.

455
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:05,242
-I'm so sorry.
-Get out.

456
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,827
Tara.

457
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,579
You're gone for five years--

458
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:12,791
Five whole years-- and then I get stabbed,
and you want to come back

459
00:29:12,875 --> 00:29:14,376
and drop all this shit on me?

460
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,463
-I thought I was protecting you.
-Protecting me from what?

461
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:20,967
The truth?

462
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,511
No. No, I...

463
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:25,846
-Sam--
-Please, Tara.

464
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,891
-Sam, I need you to get the fuck out.
-I'm so sorry.

465
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,267
-Sam.
-Please.

466
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,102

Okay, well, then go. I get it.

480

I'm not leaving you here, Sam.

482
00:30:23,362 --> 00:30:25,072
You know that part in horror movies

483
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:28,826
where you want to yell at the characters
to be smart and get the fuck out?

484
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,912
This is that part, Richie.

485
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,123
You should get the fuck out.

486
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:40,087

your sister won't talk to you.

491
00:30:57,938 --> 00:30:59,981
The police aren't gonna help.

492
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,358
What's our next move?

493
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,863

a Ghostface costume,

Sheriff Judy Hicks has now confirmed

499
00:31:22,838 --> 00:31:25,882
two more late-night attacks
that have left Woodsboro reeling.

500
00:31:25,966 --> 00:31:28,635
The first victim, Vincent Schneider,
was found dead

501
00:31:28,719 --> 00:31:30,303
behind the Corner Pocket Pool Hall,

502
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,723
and a second victim, as yet unnamed,
was attacked

503
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:36,560
inside Woodsboro General Hospital,
but she escaped without injuries.

504

Woodsboro is on high alert today--

That's a terrible reason

519

My name is Samantha Carpenter.

520
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:21,105
I was attacked last night at the hospital.

521
00:32:21,188 --> 00:32:24,399

my sister was stabbed seven times.

-Weren't you two, um...
-Yeah.

00:32:54,096 --> 00:32:55,097
Who's he?

531
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:58,642
-Uh, this is Richie, my boyfriend.
-How long have you known him?

532
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:00,436
Six months?

533
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,729
Did he know who your dad was when you met?

534
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:07,525
Express any interest in Woodsboro
or the Ghostface killings?

535
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,320
What the hell are you talking about?

536
00:33:09,403 --> 00:33:12,239
Your killer's obsessed
with the Stab movies, right?

537
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:16,702
Well, there are certain rules
to surviving a Sfab movie.

538
00:33:17,828 --> 00:33:19,120
Believe me, I know.

539
00:33:20,247 --> 00:33:21,581
Rule number one:

540
00:33:22,249 --> 00:33:24,334
Never trust the love interest.

541
00:33:24,418 --> 00:33:26,253
They seem sweet, caring, supportive.

542
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:29,590
Then welcome to Act I,
where they're trying to rip your head off.

543
00:33:29,673 --> 00:33:31,883
I was with Sam in Modesto
when Tara was attacked.

544
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:34,219
And let me guess:
You were just in the other room,

545
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,431
conveniently unaccounted for
when she was attacked at the hospital.

546
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:40,809
Do I have to take this from
shitty Sam Elliott over here, or what?

547
00:33:41,393 --> 00:33:42,852
Rule number two:

548
00:33:42,937 --> 00:33:47,437
The killer's motive is always connected
to something in the past.

549
00:33:48,692 --> 00:33:50,026
I'm related to Billy.

550
00:33:50,110 --> 00:33:52,821
Right, but then why Kill
that random Vince guy?

551
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,615
That's for you to figure out.

552
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:58,619
And rule number three--
and this is the most important rule:

553
00:33:58,702 --> 00:34:02,997
The first victim always has a friend group
that the killer is a part of.

554
00:34:03,874 --> 00:34:06,334
Does your sister have
a close-knit group of friends?

555
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:07,962
Yeah.

556
00:34:09,129 --> 00:34:10,171
She does.

557
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:12,298
Then look for the killer there.

558
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,720
If you can find out why they're doing
this, you can figure out who's next.

559
00:34:17,805 --> 00:34:19,014
So help us.

560
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:22,100
Help us figure out who is behind this.

561
00:34:22,184 --> 00:34:24,895
Oh, you kidding me?
I've been stabbed nine times.

562
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,398
I've got permanent nerve damage
and a fun little limp.

563
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:29,566
You think I want to do that again?

564
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,153
You just said it always goes
back to the past, right?

565
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,199
So if I'm in danger,

566
00:34:38,158 --> 00:34:39,826
that means you're in danger.

567
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:41,996
Come on.

Yeah, he's way more fun in the movies.

Hey, uh, what's next?

573
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:00,931

00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,481
Hey, Martha.

636
00:39:20,023 --> 00:39:22,400
Dewey! Hi!

637
00:39:22,484 --> 00:39:23,735
You look...

638
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:27,864
Yeah.

639
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,575
-How's the wife?
-Okay, Mom, we're good. Thank you.

640
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,119
All right, kids. Have fun.

641
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:39,000
I asked Mindy to call everybody here
because...

642
00:39:41,378 --> 00:39:43,797
there's something I have to tell you.

643
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,594
So let me get this straight. You're saying
that you're the daughter of Billy Loomis,

644
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,887
and, what, that one of us is the killer?

645
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:53,598
The killer told me he knew my secret.

646
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,268
He attacked Tara to lure me back here.

647
00:39:56,351 --> 00:40:00,851
But then why immediately go and murder
some douche nozzle that was stalking Liv?

648
00:40:00,939 --> 00:40:04,150
Why does it have to be one of us?
What about Deputy Dewey here?

649
00:40:04,234 --> 00:40:05,568
Maybe he's the killer.

650
00:40:06,194 --> 00:40:07,195
No offense.

651
00:40:07,279 --> 00:40:09,572
None taken, but what's my motive?

652
00:40:09,656 --> 00:40:11,741
You got stabbed a billion times,

653
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:14,744
got dumped by your famous wife
and crawled into a bottle.

654
00:40:14,828 --> 00:40:16,996
I think it's safe to say
you're on the suspect list.

655
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,748
Well, maybe you're the killer.

656
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:21,584
Because that cut deep.

657
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:24,170
That douche nozzle is connected.

658
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,716
I googled him. His mom is Leslie Macher.

659
00:40:27,799 --> 00:40:30,218
-Stu Macher's sister.
-Who's Stu Macher?

660
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,512
He's Billy Loomis's accomplice.

661
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:34,180
A real loony tune.

662
00:40:34,264 --> 00:40:35,598
Okay. Okay.

663
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:40,604
So the first three attacks are all
on people related to the original killers.

664
00:40:40,687 --> 00:40:42,522
Oh, my God. He's making a requel!

665
00:40:43,398 --> 00:40:44,399
A what?

666
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:46,735
Or a legacyquel.
Fans are torn on the terminology.

667
00:40:46,818 --> 00:40:48,402
God. Please speak English.

668
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:50,238
Remember the Stab movie
that came out last year?

669
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,949
Oh, yeah! The one
the Knives Out guy directed, right?

670
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,701
I actually really liked that one.

671
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,411
Of course you did.
You have terrible taste.

672
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:57,704
I hate you.

673
00:40:57,788 --> 00:41:00,707
The point is,
the hard-core Slab fans hated it.

674
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,125
You go on 4chan and Dreadit,

675
00:41:02,209 --> 00:41:04,753
all they're talking about is
how Stab 8 pissed on their childhoods.

676
00:41:04,836 --> 00:41:07,088
How they crammed in social commentary
just to make it elevated.

677
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:08,923
How the main character's a Mary Sue.

678
00:41:09,007 --> 00:41:11,009
-What's a Mary Sue?
-You really don't want to know.

679
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,053
What's wrong with elevated horror?

680
00:41:13,136 --> 00:41:15,096
I mean, Jordan Peele fucking rules.

681
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,473
Uh, obviously, but that's not Stab.

682
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:22,145
Real Stab movies are
meta slasher whodunits, full stop.

683
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,814
-Come on, it's just a movie.
-No, it's not.

684
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:28,067
To some people, the original
is their favorite thing in the world.

685
00:41:28,151 --> 00:41:30,653
The movie that made them love horror.

686
00:41:30,737 --> 00:41:34,073
That Mom or Dad showed them when
they were ten that bonded them together.

687
00:41:34,157 --> 00:41:37,535
And God help anyone who
slightly fucks with that special memory.

688
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:39,829
Who makes a movie
they think disrespects it.

689
00:41:39,913 --> 00:41:44,000
It sounds like our killer is writing
his own version of Stab 8,

690
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:46,002
but doing it as a requel.

691
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,671
Which is?

692
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,425
See, you can't just reboot a franchise
from scratch anymore.

693
00:41:51,508 --> 00:41:52,842
The fans won't stand for it.

694
00:41:52,926 --> 00:41:55,553
Black Christmas, Child's Play, Flatliners...

695
00:41:55,637 --> 00:41:57,013
that shit doesn't work.

696
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,766
But you can't just do
a straight sequel either.

697
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,268
You got to build something new.

698
00:42:01,351 --> 00:42:04,103
But not too new,
or the Internet goes bug-fucking nuts.

699
00:42:04,187 --> 00:42:06,397
It has to be part
of an ongoing story line,

700
00:42:06,481 --> 00:42:09,400
even if the story shouldn't have been
ongoing in the first place.

701
00:42:09,484 --> 00:42:11,235
New main characters, yes,

702
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:14,905
but supported by
and related to legacy characters.

703
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,117
Not quite a reboot, not quite a sequel.

704
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,786
Like the new Halloween, Saw,
Terminator, Jurassic Park, Ghostbusters,

705
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,205
fuck, even Star Wars!

706
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:26,334
It always,
always goes back to the original!

707
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:30,713
Are you telling me that I'm caught
in the middle of fan fucking fiction?

708
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:34,384
Not just in the middle, Sam.

709
00:42:34,926 --> 00:42:36,469
You're the star.

710
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,892
So, not to put too fine a point on it,

711
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:45,395
but, according to requel rules,

712
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,189
[sighs] who's next?

713
00:42:48,815 --> 00:42:50,149
Going by the pattern,

714
00:42:50,817 --> 00:42:54,028
whoever it is has to be connected
to someone that came before.

715
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:02,454
-I'm starting to regret coming here.
-My mom was a character in one of them.

716
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:06,082
No one cares about the shitty
inferior sequels, Wes. You're safe.

717
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,710
With Randy as our uncle, though,
you and I are probably screwed.

718
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:10,003
Wait. What?

719
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:11,088
Or you're the Killer,

720
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:14,549
and this whole elaborate monologue
is just to cover your tracks.

721
00:43:15,258 --> 00:43:18,135
I think it's pretty clear
who the killer is at this point.

722
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,221
Who?

723
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,472
You.

724
00:43:21,556 --> 00:43:22,682
Wha...

725
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,726
It makes perfect requel sense.

726
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,812
-That actually does make a lot of sense.
-Yeah.

727
00:43:30,982 --> 00:43:32,858
[scoffs] Fuck this.

728
00:43:34,444 --> 00:43:37,029
-Meet you back at the motel.
-[Richie] Sam, wait.

729
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,198
Sam, wait.

730
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,786
The first fucking rule of these movies
is don't split up!

731
00:43:47,707 --> 00:43:49,625
The nerve of that girl, right?

732
00:43:51,586 --> 00:43:54,130
I'm really not in the mood right now.

733
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,423
Sam, Sam, Sam.

734
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,634
There is a killer on the loose.

735
00:43:57,717 --> 00:43:59,802
He's threatening you.
He's threatening your sister.

736
00:43:59,886 --> 00:44:02,430
Are you gonna run away
from who you are like you always do,

737
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,015
or are you gonna use it?

738
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,391
I'm not like you.

739
00:44:05,475 --> 00:44:06,642
Really?

740
00:44:06,726 --> 00:44:08,310
And how else are you gonna survive?

741
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,771
I say accept who you are,

742
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,607
let's get out there,
find out who's doing this,

743
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,693
and cut some fucking throats!

I think that's a great idea.

Well sit down at the station, and I/
tell you about the two people I've killed.

01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:17,058
You good back there?

1118
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:19,686
Fuck, where is it?

1119
01:13:19,769 --> 01:13:21,061
Where's what?

1120
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,356
My inhaler. I usually keep an extra one.

1121
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:26,567
-Should we go back?
-Whoa. Okay.

1122
01:13:26,651 --> 01:13:29,111
I vote for not going back
to the murder hospital.

1123
01:13:29,195 --> 01:13:31,530
-You want to stop at a pharmacy?
-I'd need a prescription.

1124
01:13:31,615 --> 01:13:34,409
But I left an extra one at Amber's.
Her house is on the way.

1125
01:13:34,492 --> 01:13:36,952
No. No. No, no, no.

1126
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,288
I'd be in and out.

1127
01:13:38,371 --> 01:13:40,706
-Could you hold out till Modesto?
-I don't think so.

1128
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,166
Okay, what's the address?

1129
01:13:42,250 --> 01:13:43,918
123 No Fucking Way Lane.

1130
01:13:44,002 --> 01:13:45,920
Richie, she needs it.

1131
01:13:46,004 --> 01:13:49,215
Yeah. And I need to keep all the blood
inside my body. So do you.

1132
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:51,301
Richie, please.

1133
01:13:51,384 --> 01:13:52,593
It's okay.

1134
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:57,390
Okay, yeah. Fuck.

Keep pouring, Wheeler. Thank you.

-Beautiful son of a bitch.

Shots? Really?
This is supposed to be a memorial.

1143
01:14:30,006 --> 01:14:31,674
Well, this is how I mourn

1144
01:14:31,758 --> 01:14:35,928
and distract myself
from the looming specter of Death.

1145
01:14:36,012 --> 01:14:37,722
Hey, we're low on beer.

1146
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:39,974
There's more in the basement.
I'll go get some.

What the fuck, Mindy? Jesus!

1149
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:24,728
That was a test. And you failed.

1150
01:15:24,811 --> 01:15:27,230
Never go off on your own
when there's a masked killer around.

1151
01:15:27,313 --> 01:15:29,315
You're the one that said
we needed more beer.

1152
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,943
And you should have asked me
to come with you.

1153
01:15:33,403 --> 01:15:36,739
You know what else you shouldn't do
when there's a masked killer around?

1154
01:15:36,823 --> 01:15:37,740
What?

1155
01:15:38,783 --> 01:15:42,828
Follow someone into a dark,
creepy basement alone.

1156
01:15:44,539 --> 01:15:45,540
I mean,

1157
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:48,918
how do you know I'm not the killer?

1158
01:15:52,672 --> 01:15:53,839
Because I am.

1159
01:15:57,761 --> 01:15:59,262
I'm not, actually.

1160
01:15:59,345 --> 01:16:03,307
But let that be a lesson.
Don't trust anyone.

1161
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:07,353
Then how can I trust you
when you say you're not the killer?

1162
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:08,521
Exactly.

1163
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,734
You're learning.
Now let's go back upstairs.

1164

You first.

1165

I think I'm ready.

01:16:39,427 --> 01:16:41,429
I mean, I think we should.

1169
01:16:41,513 --> 01:16:44,057

Uh-huh. Right now.

Um--

1173
01:16:53,191 --> 01:16:57,653
Don't take this the wrong way,
but I think I have to pass on that.

1174
01:16:58,613 --> 01:16:59,822
What?

1175
01:17:01,407 --> 01:17:02,741
Why?

1176
01:17:02,826 --> 01:17:04,244
Well--

1177
01:17:04,327 --> 01:17:07,288
You know, I'm not, like, entirely sure

1178
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:10,083
that you're not the...

1179
01:17:11,251 --> 01:17:12,627
killer.

1180
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:14,586
"Don't take this the wrong way"?

1181
01:17:14,671 --> 01:17:19,171
No, no, no, look. I'm almost 100% certain
that you are not,

1182
01:17:19,425 --> 01:17:22,761
but the safest option is to be down here

1183
01:17:22,846 --> 01:17:23,930
with all the people...

1184
01:17:24,013 --> 01:17:25,472
Fuck you.

1185
01:17:25,557 --> 01:17:26,933
...and the potential witnesses.

1186
01:17:27,016 --> 01:17:29,435
That is a completely valid
emotional response to have.

1187
01:17:30,270 --> 01:17:32,146
-That too.
-Fucking asshole.

1188

Good job.

01:17:36,776 --> 01:17:37,818
Fuck you, Mindy.

1190
01:17:39,195 --> 01:17:41,864
If I hadn't have written that book
about your mother,

1191

-none of this would've happened.
-Gale.

-No, you didn't.

Billy Loomis started this,
and we're gonna end it.

After tonight, no more books,
no more movies, no more fucking Ghostface.

-What rules?

[laughing]

1198
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:06,055
There are certain specific rules
that one must abide by

1199
01:18:06,139 --> 01:18:08,641
<i>in order to successfully survive
a horror movie.</i>

-Okay.

1201
01:18:10,226 --> 01:18:12,686
-Number one: You can never have sex.
-Ugh. Don't do it.

1202
01:18:12,770 --> 01:18:15,397
-Don't go outside after her.
-She's not texting me back.

1203
01:18:15,481 --> 01:18:16,648
Because she's probably dead.

1204
01:18:16,733 --> 01:18:19,610
Jesus, Mindy.
That's my girlfriend, and I love her.

1205

Was your girlfriend.

1206
01:18:21,321 --> 01:18:24,115
You're just gonna sit and watch a movie
about our uncle getting stabbed?

It calms me down, okay?

I'm also gonna smoke some weed
and possibly hook up with Frances.

01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,555
Hi.

1277
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:42,808
Uh, do you know if there's any beer left?
There's none in the kitchen.

1278
01:23:42,892 --> 01:23:45,519
Yes, Richie, there's beer in the basement.

1279
01:23:46,479 --> 01:23:48,314
Right behind you. Basement.

1280
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:50,065
Yeah.

1281
01:23:50,149 --> 01:23:52,151
Do you wanna, uh, come with me?

1282
01:23:52,235 --> 01:23:55,112
[chuckles] No. But you were right to ask.

1283
01:23:55,196 --> 01:23:57,031
-Yeah. Um--
-Mm-hmm.

1284
01:23:58,908 --> 01:24:00,284
Okay. I'll be right back.

1285
01:24:00,368 --> 01:24:02,870
[mock laughter]

1286
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:04,747
Yeah. Yeah.

-[door opens, closes]
-Well, he's dead. [gasps]

1288
01:24:08,417 --> 01:24:10,752
The goddamn fucking Uber canceled on me!

1289
01:24:11,504 --> 01:24:15,049
Great. Now I can't have sex,
and I can't get a ride home.

1290
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,135
Could this night get any shittier?

1291
01:24:18,219 --> 01:24:20,262
Liv, where's my brother?

1292
01:24:20,346 --> 01:24:24,224
What? I don't know, Mindy. Probably off
accusing everyone of being the killer!

1293
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:27,352
He actually went looking for you.

1294
01:24:29,021 --> 01:24:30,897
I didn't see him. Okay?

1295
01:24:32,316 --> 01:24:34,443
Why are you looking at me like that?

1296
01:24:35,027 --> 01:24:37,654
Just revising my suspect list.

1297
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:41,617
Fuck this.

1298
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,626
Are you afraid of me, Mindy?

1299
01:24:50,710 --> 01:24:52,628
[laughs]

1300
01:24:52,712 --> 01:24:56,173
You think I did something
to your brother? Huh?

1301
01:24:56,757 --> 01:24:59,593
You think I'm gonna cut you up?

1302
01:25:00,595 --> 01:25:02,638
A little bit now, yeah.

1303
01:25:03,681 --> 01:25:07,059
I thought you said
I was too boring to be the killer.

1304
01:25:07,643 --> 01:25:10,479
Maybe that's the twist.

1305
01:25:11,647 --> 01:25:15,108
What do you think, huh? You're the expert.

1306
01:25:16,694 --> 01:25:20,739
You know what eventually happens
to the expert?

1307
01:25:21,782 --> 01:25:22,783
What?

1308
01:25:29,248 --> 01:25:30,832
Enjoy your stupid movie.

1309
01:25:33,502 --> 01:25:36,421
Fucking psycho.

1310
01:25:36,505 --> 01:25:37,964
They stopped.

-No.

-Oh, shit.
-What?

1313
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,641
Oh, shit. How far are we?

1314
01:25:47,725 --> 01:25:48,726
Too far.

1315

01:25:58,653 --> 01:25:59,654
Hello.

1319
01:25:59,737 --> 01:26:01,655
You need to get out
of that house right now.

1320
01:26:01,739 --> 01:26:02,823
How do you know where I am?

1321
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:06,035
You're in Stu Macher's house,
where your dad and Stu killed everyone.

1322
01:26:06,118 --> 01:26:09,162
<i>Someone planned to get you there.
You need to get the fuck out, Sam!</i>

1323
01:26:17,463 --> 01:26:19,590
No, Jamie. Watch out.

-[chuckling]
-Watch out Jamie.

1325

You know he's around. You know--

1326
01:26:24,887 --> 01:26:26,138
-What?
-There he is.

1327
01:26:26,222 --> 01:26:30,722
Come on, man, turn around!
Turn around! Dude!

1328
01:26:30,810 --> 01:26:34,313
I told you. I fold you,
he's around the corner. Jamie.

1329
01:26:34,897 --> 01:26:37,983
-Look behind you.
-No, Randy, look behind you.

1330
01:26:38,067 --> 01:26:40,194
Come on, man, turn around!

1331
01:26:40,277 --> 01:26:43,321
-Dude, what are you doing? You can do it!
- Turn around! Behind you!

1332
01:26:43,406 --> 01:26:45,825
These are your rules! Own that shit.

1333
01:26:46,575 --> 01:26:48,493
Behind you! Turn around.

1334
01:26:48,577 --> 01:26:50,412
Look behind...

1335

That's a lot of blood, Sam.

-Nothing.

No, I didn't do anything.

-Is she okay?

1345

-What the fuck?
-Richie, where the fuck were you?

1346
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:28,951
I went into the basement to get beer.

1347
01:27:29,034 --> 01:27:30,243
You went to the basement alone?

1348
01:27:30,327 --> 01:27:32,954
I asked her to come with me!
She said no! Fuck!

1349
01:27:33,706 --> 01:27:34,957
Stay the fuck back.

Jesus Christ!

1351
01:27:36,375 --> 01:27:38,877
I was with Tara, but the rest of you
were wandering around.

1352
01:27:38,961 --> 01:27:40,837
One of you is the fucking killer!

1353
01:27:40,921 --> 01:27:43,298
Fuck you, Amber. Fuck you!

1354
01:27:43,382 --> 01:27:46,134
-Why is there blood on your hands?
-What?

1355
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:51,390
- I found Chad. I found Chad--
-Chad?

-You're fucking lying.
-No.

-You're the killer.
-No, I'm not.

Liv, stop.

1359
01:27:57,229 --> 01:27:59,397
-Fuck you!
-Liv, just stop!

Fuck you, Amber.
I'm not the fucking killer!

-Oh, my God-- Tara!
-Wait, no, Sam. She has a gun.

1369

There are always two killers.

Sam, please put the knife down.

Look, I think...

1372
01:28:41,273 --> 01:28:43,441
- I think the other killer might be Tara.
-What?

1373
01:28:43,526 --> 01:28:47,029
She's the one that brought us here,
and you two have been estranged for years.

1374
01:28:48,614 --> 01:28:49,698
I mean,

1375
01:28:50,658 --> 01:28:52,159
how well do you really know her?

1376
01:28:52,868 --> 01:28:54,578
Better than I know you.

Not this movie, Sidney.

[device whirs]

1432
01:33:52,334 --> 01:33:54,878
But it really was
the best choice for the movie.

1433
01:33:57,256 --> 01:33:59,466
This isn't a fucking movie!

1434
01:34:00,551 --> 01:34:02,427
No. But it will be.

1435
01:34:04,012 --> 01:34:06,723
-That's the point, right, Amber?
-Right, hon!

1436
01:34:06,807 --> 01:34:10,477
Third Act bloodbath, check.
Killers revealed, check.

1437
01:34:10,561 --> 01:34:12,312
Time for the big finale!

-Shh, shh. shh.

1440
01:34:18,986 --> 01:34:21,113
Okay. Okay.

1441
01:34:21,196 --> 01:34:23,198
Let's get 'em into the kitchen.

1442
01:34:24,116 --> 01:34:25,367
Let's go, bitch!

1443
01:34:25,450 --> 01:34:27,785
Someone has to save the franchise.

1444
01:34:27,870 --> 01:34:32,370
You see, no one has made
a great Stab movie since the first one.

1445
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:34,208
Not really.

1446
01:34:34,293 --> 01:34:37,462
Hey, baby, you want to go get
the very ex-Mrs. Riley?

1447
01:34:37,546 --> 01:34:38,672
Yeah, I do.

1448
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:41,132
Hey, hey!

1449
01:34:41,216 --> 01:34:43,593
Whoa. Whoa.

1450
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,138
Sidney Prescott.

1451
01:34:46,221 --> 01:34:47,680
You know,

1452
01:34:49,224 --> 01:34:50,516
I'm a really big fan.

1453
01:34:50,601 --> 01:34:51,643
Go fuck yourself.

1454
01:34:52,352 --> 01:34:55,396
-You see the last Stab movie?
-Not really a fan of scary movies.

1455
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,857
That checks out. Anyway, it sucked balls.

1456
01:34:57,941 --> 01:35:01,361
Because nobody takes
the true fans seriously. Not really.

1457
01:35:02,321 --> 01:35:04,323
They just laugh at us. And why?

1458
01:35:04,990 --> 01:35:08,702
Because we love something?
We're just a fucking joke to them?

1459
01:35:09,912 --> 01:35:13,498
How can fandom be toxic?

1460
01:35:13,582 --> 01:35:15,292
It's about love!

1461
01:35:15,375 --> 01:35:19,087
They don't fucking understand
that these movies are important to people.

1462
01:35:19,171 --> 01:35:20,672
-Richie...
-And we're gonna help them!

1463
01:35:21,506 --> 01:35:24,258
Hollywood's totally fucking out of ideas,

1464
01:35:24,343 --> 01:35:27,512
so we decided we'd give them
some new source material to follow.

1465
01:35:27,596 --> 01:35:29,431
You know? Bring it back to basics.

1466
01:35:29,514 --> 01:35:31,557
"Cause that's how you make
a great Stab movie, Sam.

1467

-"Based on actual events."
-[Gale groans]

1468
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:38,523
-Gale.
-Sit the fuck down!

1469
01:35:38,607 --> 01:35:40,817
[Richie] Back up. Back up.

1470
01:35:42,694 --> 01:35:44,529
[Richie chuckles]

1471
01:35:45,072 --> 01:35:46,073
Eee! Eee! Eee!

1472
01:35:46,156 --> 01:35:50,326
You did all this just to make me
the hero of your fucked-up movie?

1473
01:35:50,410 --> 01:35:53,287
Sweetie, you're not the hero.

1474
01:35:55,540 --> 01:35:56,749
You're the villain.

1475
01:35:57,709 --> 01:36:01,421
The daughter of Billy Loomis who sees
fucked-up visions of her dead dad.

1476
01:36:01,505 --> 01:36:03,381
Sidney Prescott killed your father.

1477
01:36:03,966 --> 01:36:06,426
You did all this

1478
01:36:06,510 --> 01:36:08,595
just to get her back to Woodsboro.

1479
01:36:09,972 --> 01:36:13,266
You know what the biggest problem
with the Sfab movies is?

1480
01:36:13,809 --> 01:36:16,978
There's no Michael Myers
or Jason Voorhees.

1481
01:36:17,062 --> 01:36:19,355
No bad guy to keep coming back.

1482
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:22,567
But the illegitimate daughter
of the original mastermind?

1483
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:25,820
[scoffs] Now, that's a fucking villain.

1484
01:36:25,904 --> 01:36:28,573
-How did you know?
-Oh, about your father?

1485
01:36:29,825 --> 01:36:33,161
It's a small town and your mom's a drunk!

1486
01:36:33,870 --> 01:36:35,830
I met Richie on the Sfab subreddit.

1487
01:36:36,665 --> 01:36:40,085
I've been obsessed ever since
my parents bought this house.

1488
01:36:40,877 --> 01:36:43,462
We realized pretty quickly
we had similar ideas.

1489
01:36:43,547 --> 01:36:46,091
Wasn't that hard for me
to find you in Modesto.

1490
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,177
It wasn't that hard for me
to fuck you either.

1491
01:36:49,261 --> 01:36:52,514
I guess being a sexually available woman
is supposed to be empowering these days.

1492
01:36:52,597 --> 01:36:53,931
Fuck you!

1493
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:56,101
Well, now you're just
quoting the original.

1494
01:36:57,102 --> 01:36:59,187
But it wouldn't work with just you, Sam.

1495
01:36:59,855 --> 01:37:03,233
See, we had to bring the legacy characters
back to make it matter.

1496
01:37:04,318 --> 01:37:07,154
Can't have a bona fide Halloween
without Jamie Lee!

1497
01:37:07,237 --> 01:37:09,822
-[Richie] Nope!
-Dewey had to die to make it real.

1498
01:37:09,906 --> 01:37:12,283
To show that this
wasn't just some bullshit,

1499
01:37:12,367 --> 01:37:15,411
cash-in, run-of-the-mill sequel.

1500
01:37:16,038 --> 01:37:19,541
Because our movie has fucking stakes!

1501
01:37:20,667 --> 01:37:22,794
'Cause anyone can die in a requel.

1502
01:37:24,755 --> 01:37:26,590
-No!
-[Richie] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1503
01:37:27,382 --> 01:37:29,425
[Richie] Goddamn it. Whoa, whoa!

1504
01:37:29,509 --> 01:37:31,761
No, hey! Sit the fuck down.

1505
01:37:35,307 --> 01:37:37,350
I'm so sorry, Sid.

1506
01:37:37,934 --> 01:37:41,270
We can't let you live either.
I mean, surviving this many times--

1507
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:43,440
That would just be ridiculous.

1508
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:46,984
This time the fans are gonna be
the ones who win.

1509
01:37:49,738 --> 01:37:52,365
-That about cover it?
-Nailed it, baby.

1510
01:37:53,492 --> 01:37:57,120
Get Tara out of the closet.
We got to start staging the bodies!

1511
01:37:58,205 --> 01:37:59,664
Stay with me, Sid.

1512
01:38:00,624 --> 01:38:01,625
Stay with me.

1513
01:38:01,708 --> 01:38:03,751
[Richie]
You really should've listened to Dewey.

1514
01:38:03,835 --> 01:38:07,588
He nailed it in one!
Dude, look at the love interest!

1515
01:38:07,672 --> 01:38:09,090
Are you fucking stupid?

1516
01:38:09,174 --> 01:38:11,217
I even had you convinced
it could be your sister.

1517
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:15,555
[Amber] Um, she's not here.

1518
01:38:18,642 --> 01:38:20,685
What the fuck do you mean, she's not here?

1519
01:38:20,769 --> 01:38:22,187
[Amber] She's not here!

1520
01:38:22,270 --> 01:38:23,688
I untied her.

1521
01:38:25,440 --> 01:38:27,733
Guess you're not
as persuasive as you thought.

That's for you.

1524

[scoffs] Yeah, like your gimpy
little sister's gonna make a difference.

1525
01:38:39,371 --> 01:38:41,581
She's our fucking pincushion
at this point.

1526
01:38:41,665 --> 01:38:44,668
Amber! Fan out.
She couldn't have gotten far.

1527
01:38:44,751 --> 01:38:46,252
I can't find her!

1528
01:38:52,843 --> 01:38:54,511

Your big scene's coming up!

1534
01:39:28,753 --> 01:39:30,004
Fucking kill you!

1535

The fucking hand sanitizer?

1536
01:39:41,057 --> 01:39:43,768
No, no, no, no, no!
It's not my fault! It's not my fault!

1537
01:39:43,852 --> 01:39:45,687
Let me guess: The movies made you do it?

1538
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:48,314
No, it was the message boards!
I was radicalized.

1539
01:39:48,398 --> 01:39:50,566
-By movie fans?
-Yes, they're so mad!

1540
01:39:50,650 --> 01:39:53,861
It's not my fault. I'm just a dumb kid.
I wanted to be a part of something.

1541
01:39:53,945 --> 01:39:57,114
"A part of something"?
You killed my best friend!

1542
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:59,242
Yeah, and he died like a pussy.

01:40:16,885 --> 01:40:18,761
So many blood trails.

1546
01:40:18,845 --> 01:40:20,221
This one yours?

1547
01:40:21,473 --> 01:40:22,974
Only one way to find out!

1548
01:40:29,648 --> 01:40:32,484
I was the last thing Dewey saw
before he died too.

1549
01:40:32,567 --> 01:40:34,652
I can't believe I get to do you both.

No last-minute saves this time.
Your story's over!

1551
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,831
Time to pass the torch.

It's all yours, bitch!

-You want to do the honors?
-This one's yours.

What are you gonna do now, huh?

Make a scary phone call to me?

Pop out of that closet
in a Ghostface mask?

No.

I still prefer The Babadook.

1590
01:44:35,268 --> 01:44:36,352
Are you okay?

1591
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:38,229
-Are you good?
-Mm-hmm.

1592
01:44:48,198 --> 01:44:50,241
I'm so sorry. Excuse me.

1593
01:44:51,951 --> 01:44:53,243
Excuse me, sir.

1594
01:44:55,538 --> 01:44:57,331
Hey.

1595
01:44:57,415 --> 01:44:59,125
-Hey.
-She's gonna be okay.

1596
01:45:11,763 --> 01:45:14,265
Can you take us
to a different hospital this time?

1597
01:45:14,349 --> 01:45:15,350
Of course.

1598
01:45:18,353 --> 01:45:19,479
You ready to go?

1599
01:45:24,859 --> 01:45:26,402
I'll be right back, yeah?

1600
01:45:33,159 --> 01:45:34,618
Your vitals look good.

1601
01:45:35,453 --> 01:45:37,455
You sit tight for a draft, okay?

1602
01:45:37,539 --> 01:45:39,624
Sidney. Gale.

1603
01:45:42,544 --> 01:45:43,711
Thank you both.

1604
01:45:44,754 --> 01:45:45,755
For everything.

1605
01:45:47,173 --> 01:45:49,049
Are you gonna be all right?

1606
01:45:50,218 --> 01:45:52,678
I'll survive. I always do.

1607
01:45:53,555 --> 01:45:54,597
You were right

1608
01:45:55,431 --> 01:45:56,807
about not running.

1609
01:45:57,559 --> 01:45:58,851
Sorry about that.

1610
01:46:00,895 --> 01:46:01,937
How are you doing?

1611
01:46:03,940 --> 01:46:05,441
Ask me in a few days.

1612
01:46:07,277 --> 01:46:09,404
But at least I know
what I'm gonna write about.

1613
01:46:09,487 --> 01:46:10,946
What's that?

1614
01:46:12,031 --> 01:46:13,490
Not this.

1615
01:46:13,575 --> 01:46:15,451
Those fuckers can die in anonymity.

1616
01:46:16,578 --> 01:46:20,290
But maybe something about a good man
who used to be the sheriff here once.

1617
01:46:21,875 --> 01:46:23,334
I'd like to read that story.

1618
01:46:24,878 --> 01:46:26,713
Can I ask you a weird question?

1619
01:46:27,547 --> 01:46:28,798
Yeah.

1620
01:46:30,300 --> 01:46:31,676
Am I gonna be okay?

1621
01:46:34,220 --> 01:46:35,638
Eventually.

1622
01:47:00,246 --> 01:47:02,331
-Hey.
-Hey, Sam, Sam, Sam!

1623
01:47:03,333 --> 01:47:04,334
Thank you.

1624
01:47:07,211 --> 01:47:09,338
Well, you're not going anywhere
without me.

1625
01:47:10,632 --> 01:47:11,799
Don't worry.

1626
01:47:12,383 --> 01:47:14,510
I'm gonna hold your hand
all the way there.

1627
01:47:18,348 --> 01:47:20,391
I can take care of her and her sister.

1628
01:47:20,475 --> 01:47:22,393
She's all ready for transport.

Twenty-five years ago, almost to the day,

1630
01:47:34,906 --> 01:47:38,075
in this very house, a tragic story ended.

1631
01:47:38,159 --> 01:47:41,412
Tonight, a new chapter came to a close.

1632
01:47:41,496 --> 01:47:43,748
Police do not have
a lot of information right now,

1633
01:47:43,831 --> 01:47:45,666
as they are still collecting evidence.

1634
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:48,836
As you can see,
this is a very active crime scene here.

1635
01:47:48,920 --> 01:47:51,422
An unknown number of fatalities,
several injuries,

1636
01:47:51,506 --> 01:47:54,926
some people being taken off
by ambulance right now as we speak.

1637
01:47:55,009 --> 01:47:56,510
This is a developing story...
