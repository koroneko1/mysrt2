01:17.193 --> 01:18.500
Jack!

01:20.850 --> 01:22.383
At your ready, Miss Beatrix.

01:25.302 --> 01:27.903
I call upon the witches' den

01:27.953 --> 01:29.575
to let what's been expired

01:30.225 --> 01:31.400
rise again.

01:46.350 --> 01:47.622
Congratulations!

01:47.872 --> 01:49.500
<i>You've completed your final exam.</i>

01:49.550 --> 01:51.206
You'll be celebrated
as a full witch

01:51.256 --> 01:52.500
this weekend at the ball.

01:55.159 --> 01:58.200
Congratulations, Bebe.
I'm so happy for you.

01:58.650 --> 01:59.650
Jasmine.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.235
<i>Grayson.</i>

02:03.485 --> 02:05.074
Your final exam, if you will.

02:10.193 --> 02:13.390
For my final exam,
I've chosen to create um...

02:13.440 --> 02:14.440
Chatter root.

02:14.790 --> 02:18.495
A plant which give animals
the ability to speak.

02:18.745 --> 02:19.783
<i>Um, excuse me...</i>

02:20.033 --> 02:22.250
Miss Toola, I never knew
you that could buy

02:22.300 --> 02:24.250
your final exam from
a potion store.

02:24.700 --> 02:25.820
Jasmine.

02:25.870 --> 02:26.994
<i>Well, I'm just saying.</i>

02:27.044 --> 02:28.850
He's bragging about
making his own telephone.

02:28.900 --> 02:30.683
That will be enough, Jasmine.

02:31.709 --> 02:33.650
<i>Yes, well, chatter root is</i>

02:33.700 --> 02:37.194
typically used as a phone-like
tool amongst witches and warlocks.

02:37.944 --> 02:39.473
I've created my own strand.

02:40.723 --> 02:43.060
<i>With this chatter root,
the animal should be able to</i>

02:43.110 --> 02:44.110
speak for itself.

02:44.160 --> 02:45.970
That is, if it works.

02:49.620 --> 02:50.810
By the light of the moon,

02:52.160 --> 02:53.525
<i>nurture it when weak,</i>

02:54.075 --> 02:55.330
<i>uh, grant this creature</i>

02:55.380 --> 02:56.570
the power to speak.

03:07.620 --> 03:09.161
Well, Mister Lemur.

03:09.311 --> 03:10.754
Is there anything
you'd like to say?

03:12.440 --> 03:14.253
Hello, everyone!

03:16.103 --> 03:16.994
Oh.

03:18.444 --> 03:20.743
Which one of you is Sara?

03:21.393 --> 03:23.533
Um, me.

03:24.228 --> 03:27.360
Grayson sits up every night
pretending he's on dates with you.

03:28.910 --> 03:29.800
<i>Um...</i>

03:29.950 --> 03:31.123
Um, Miss Toola...

03:31.323 --> 03:32.573
<i>how do I shut this thing off?</i>

03:32.623 --> 03:34.946
H-he wants your wedding
to be on a beach.

03:35.296 --> 03:36.100
Shh!

03:36.350 --> 03:37.700
Help me.

03:52.050 --> 03:52.998
Sara, wait!

03:53.248 --> 03:54.850
He was... just kidding.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.076
But I really wasn't!

03:57.159 --> 03:59.587

04:03.870 --> 04:05.060
A moment please.

04:05.110 --> 04:05.710
Uh...

04:05.810 --> 04:07.471
<i>- did I do something wrong?
- No!</i>

04:07.521 --> 04:09.650
Oh, no, not at all, I...

04:09.700 --> 04:11.735
just wanted to take
a moment to tell you

04:11.785 --> 04:12.814
how proud I am.

04:12.864 --> 04:13.964
I know how hard it can be

04:14.014 --> 04:16.550
for someone who wasn't born
full witch to succeed.

04:16.892 --> 04:18.005
Thank you, Miss Toola.

04:18.055 --> 04:19.351
I had a great teacher.

04:20.351 --> 04:22.846
Well, I also wanted
to give you this.

04:26.662 --> 04:29.350
But I thought it was
tradition not to get this

04:29.400 --> 04:30.710
until the ceremony.

04:30.960 --> 04:32.100
Well, yes, that's true,

04:32.150 --> 04:35.130
but it's also tradition that
the valedictorian

04:35.180 --> 04:37.333
get theirs in advance
to serve as inspiration

04:37.383 --> 04:39.077
for writing their speech.

04:39.727 --> 04:41.206
Valedictorian?

04:41.656 --> 04:43.056
Yes, you've earned it.

04:43.447 --> 04:46.300
But, I cannot stress enough
how important it is

04:46.550 --> 04:48.800
that you only use it
for inspiration.

04:49.198 --> 04:51.600
The valedictorian ball is
as old as our magic

04:51.650 --> 04:53.264
and must be treated as such.

04:53.914 --> 04:55.030
Of course.

04:55.080 --> 04:56.820
I won't let anything
happen to it.

04:58.070 --> 04:59.440
Miss Toola...

04:59.990 --> 05:02.585
I believe it's custom
that the valedictorian

05:02.635 --> 05:04.500
of the Witches' Ball
be a royal.

05:04.850 --> 05:08.240
Unfortunately, that's a sad myth
spread by pure families.

05:08.590 --> 05:11.600
The witch with the highest grade
has always been chosen

05:11.650 --> 05:13.700
regardless of bloodline.

05:14.650 --> 05:15.415
Miss Toola,

05:15.465 --> 05:17.850
my dad said to me this morning
that if I didn't pass today

05:17.900 --> 05:19.930
that I shouldn't come home.
So could you please pass me?

05:19.980 --> 05:21.480
Because if not, I'd be
a homeless person.

05:21.530 --> 05:22.883
And you have to pass by me
every morning.

05:22.933 --> 05:24.000
And have to give me
change because

05:24.050 --> 05:25.340
you feel so bad
for making me homeless.

05:25.390 --> 05:27.610
So can you please pass me
so you won't have to feel bad?

05:28.497 --> 05:30.900
Okay, Jack, we will go
and talk to your father.

05:31.050 --> 05:32.622
You will not be homeless.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.760
My mother said they were
giving the valedictorian ball

05:36.810 --> 05:38.410
away to a charity case
this year.

05:38.460 --> 05:40.282
What did your mother say to you?

05:40.432 --> 05:41.955
She isn't a witch, is she?

05:42.205 --> 05:43.330
Although she tries to be.

05:43.380 --> 05:44.060
Just.

05:44.110 --> 05:44.830
Like.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.880
Us.

05:47.023 --> 05:48.050
For the last eight years,

05:48.100 --> 05:51.120
I've had to listen to you
say mean things to me, Jasmine.

05:51.170 --> 05:52.312
The name-calling.

05:52.362 --> 05:54.351
Making fun of my mother
for being human.

05:54.701 --> 05:57.432
But I've decided I'm not
gonna fight with anymore.

05:57.682 --> 06:00.015
'Cause I know this
could say more

06:00.065 --> 06:02.042
than any words
I could come up with.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.464
<i>Just confess your love to her.</i>

06:04.714 --> 06:06.001
<i>Free your heart.</i>

06:06.051 --> 06:08.625
I would give anything
for a shut up spell.

06:08.875 --> 06:10.254
He loves you, Sara.

06:24.617 --> 06:26.440
See, Yazzy, this is why
her kind

06:26.490 --> 06:28.620
shouldn't be allowed
to have nice things.

06:29.070 --> 06:30.168
Come, Yazzy.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.998
The brooms, the wands,
the potions,

07:01.048 --> 07:02.126
and the glamour.

07:02.476 --> 07:04.125
In the next few days,

07:04.175 --> 07:07.454
the place you see behind me
will be transformed

07:07.504 --> 07:09.940
into this year's Witches' Ball.

07:10.190 --> 07:13.700
And taking on the
almost impossible task

07:13.750 --> 07:16.100
of organizing the ball
this year is Brooke.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.030
So, let me ask you, Brooke.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.000
Are you at all worried
that the last four people

07:20.050 --> 07:22.610
to organize the ball
had a nervous breakdown?

07:23.760 --> 07:24.645
Uh...

07:25.295 --> 07:27.035
I'm sorry, they...
they what?

07:28.872 --> 07:30.060
And there you have it.

07:30.110 --> 07:31.135
"I'm sorry,

07:31.185 --> 07:33.290
<i>"they what?"
Back to you, Kent.</i>

07:36.740 --> 07:38.950
Sweetie, you gotta try this.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.650
Uh, Trigg, could you buy
chatter root like I asked.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.510
I have a million calls to make.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.414
Sure thing.

07:44.864 --> 07:46.810
I'll do it as soon as
I'm done this round.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.180
Call Oren.

07:53.230 --> 07:54.960
Hello, Brooke, sweetheart.

07:55.010 --> 07:56.910
What am I speaking through?

07:56.960 --> 07:59.300
I have a sudden urge
to chase a cat.

07:59.550 --> 08:00.800
It's my dog.

08:01.050 --> 08:02.125
Oh, wonderful.

08:02.325 --> 08:04.816
You are speaking through
my guinea pig, Jasper.

08:05.466 --> 08:06.772
Uh, sorry to hear about
your broom.

08:06.822 --> 08:08.815
Could we send you a new one?
There's three days.

08:08.865 --> 08:10.405
So that would get you
here on time.

08:10.655 --> 08:12.012
A new one?

08:12.262 --> 08:15.655
My dear, I've had this broom
since I've had most things.

08:17.438 --> 08:18.610
What about trunk travel?

08:18.660 --> 08:21.004
I know it's slower
than a broom, but...

08:21.254 --> 08:23.990
Ooh, yes. I rather like
trunks, actually.

08:27.937 --> 08:30.022
Trunk is booked.

08:30.072 --> 08:31.870
Just show up to the
terminal at 8:00 tomorrow

08:31.920 --> 08:33.251
and we'll get you
to us on time.

08:33.302 --> 08:34.000
<i>Splendid!</i>

08:34.049 --> 08:35.424
<i>Tell my goddaughter I can't</i>

08:35.475 --> 08:37.294
wait to see her
on her big day.

08:37.544 --> 08:39.500
Oh, and on yours too, my dear.

08:39.950 --> 08:41.280
<i>Okay, Oren, love you.</i>

08:42.371 --> 08:43.320
This is incredible.

08:43.770 --> 08:46.930
I get to battle ogres
like an actual warlock.

08:46.980 --> 08:49.360
You <i>are</i> an actual warlock
who battles ogres, dear.

08:49.410 --> 08:50.295
Yeah, I know.

08:50.645 --> 08:52.942
But this way,
it is completely safe.

08:57.053 --> 09:00.110
Oh, I got Oren booked
on a trunk for tomorrow.

09:00.160 --> 09:02.145
It will be close, but he
should make it on time.

09:02.195 --> 09:03.182
Relax!

09:03.432 --> 09:04.778
<i>The ball is weeks away.</i>

09:05.528 --> 09:07.500
The ball's in three days.

09:12.993 --> 09:15.915
I put my hand inside the toilet.

09:19.852 --> 09:22.176
Can someone tell me
who toilet man is?

09:22.595 --> 09:24.811
Ah, this is my cousin, Yuri.

09:25.268 --> 09:27.236
He's gonna stay with us
until the ball.

09:28.744 --> 09:32.390
Eh, I put my hand
inside the toilet.

09:33.533 --> 09:35.000
It's the only English he knows.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.035
Super.

09:39.485 --> 09:40.360
<i>Oh, hey...</i>

09:40.938 --> 09:42.634
I was hoping
to work on our song.

09:43.284 --> 09:45.200
Mom, we've rehearsed it
a million times.

09:45.550 --> 09:46.640
We know it.

09:47.590 --> 09:48.840
Stop.

09:55.090 --> 09:56.564
Did you think
we wouldn't know?

09:59.643 --> 10:00.570
What?

10:02.029 --> 10:03.600
Your last class,
how did it go?

10:03.650 --> 10:06.330
Oh, right, uh,
it went well.

10:06.580 --> 10:07.418
I passed.

10:08.768 --> 10:09.940
That's my girl!

10:12.690 --> 10:13.911
You brought the rose
back to life?

10:14.361 --> 10:15.182
I did.

10:17.532 --> 10:19.800
My little wand
is all grown up.

10:21.650 --> 10:24.143
Mom, you promised to go
a week without crying.

10:24.293 --> 10:25.910
I know, I know, it's just...

10:28.021 --> 10:30.950
We're both going to become
witches at the same time.

10:34.769 --> 10:36.113
I'll be in my room.

10:41.859 --> 10:43.550
I put my hand...

10:45.480 --> 10:46.960
Inside the toilet.

10:48.074 --> 10:50.300
We all put our hands
inside the toilet.

We have a serious problem.

11:18.734 --> 11:19.833
<i>Wait, w-w-what?</i>

11:20.083 --> 11:21.030
Are we out of cheese?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.800
Whoa, wait, wait, is the world

11:22.850 --> 11:24.500
<i>out of cheese? I mean,</i>

11:24.550 --> 11:25.796
on a scale from one to ten,

11:26.246 --> 11:27.600
how cheese-related
is this problem?

11:29.650 --> 11:30.493
Look.

11:30.643 --> 11:31.543
<i>Whoa!</i>

11:32.193 --> 11:33.172
I know.

11:33.376 --> 11:35.600
Uh, I mean, sorry.
That wasn't like a "whoa!"

11:35.650 --> 11:37.360
It was more like a "whoa."
I should've said.

11:37.410 --> 11:40.015
Uh, like, you know, I got
no idea what I'm lookin' at.

11:40.593 --> 11:42.211
Miss Toola named me
valedictorian.

11:42.261 --> 11:43.915
And she gave me
this to bring to the ball.

11:44.842 --> 11:47.560
Hey! Valedictorian!
Look at you!

11:47.610 --> 11:48.168
Well, uh...

11:48.218 --> 11:49.660
<i>That's the
smart thing, right?</i>

11:50.410 --> 11:52.835
Oh, um, judging by your
expression here, um...

11:53.935 --> 11:54.995
not time to celebrate.

11:55.245 --> 11:56.245
This is serious.

11:56.295 --> 11:58.440
I have to get this
fixed by this weekend.

11:58.990 --> 12:00.044
<i>All right, all right, all right.</i>

12:00.094 --> 12:01.610
<i>Uh, so open one of your,
you know,</i>

12:01.660 --> 12:03.800
<i>wavy wand books and
just put it back together.</i>

12:04.779 --> 12:06.444
Its' not gonna be that easy.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.360
It's enchanted.
It's way beyond me.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.770
<i>Bea, I made you some lunch.</i>

12:13.082 --> 12:15.173
Try to think of something.
I'll be back in a bit.

12:16.765 --> 12:19.720
Sure thing. I mean, y-you
said it was beyond you.

12:19.770 --> 12:23.000
But, I'm sure non-magic rat
can fix it.

12:23.450 --> 12:25.860
Oh, man. I smell garlic.

12:26.510 --> 12:27.900
I love garlic.

12:29.122 --> 12:31.124
- Here you are, Miss.
- Oh, thank you.

12:31.374 --> 12:33.950
So, tomorrow I'm picking up
your cousins from the airport.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.450
But your grandma
will be here first thing.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.610
Ugh, pfff, I hate dresses.

12:37.860 --> 12:39.054
It's tradition.

12:39.404 --> 12:40.570
According to the handbook,

12:40.620 --> 12:42.990
the gown should reflect
the witch's inner self.

12:44.140 --> 12:47.275
Did you take all the night
classes to convert into a witch?

12:47.475 --> 12:49.330
Yeah, did you read
all the books?

12:49.380 --> 12:50.950
Why, yes, actually, I did.

12:51.200 --> 12:52.300
How come this
is the first time

12:52.350 --> 12:53.953
we're hearing about this,
young lady?

12:54.954 --> 12:57.690
One night, Bea.
364 days a year

12:57.740 --> 12:59.235
I'll support whatever
wardrobe you choose.

12:59.285 --> 13:00.333
I just need this one.

13:06.443 --> 13:08.170
Trigg, can you have
a look at the toilet?

13:08.220 --> 13:09.683
It's making that noise again.

13:11.254 --> 13:12.433
Toilet.

13:17.216 --> 13:19.483
And that's why
I make the big bucks.

13:19.733 --> 13:21.146
And see this here, Bea?

13:21.396 --> 13:23.420
This is why I love your father.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.370
Oh.

13:27.014 --> 13:29.870
Oh, man, ew.

13:31.195 --> 13:33.080
Okay. You done?

13:33.706 --> 13:34.440
So, uh...

13:34.715 --> 13:37.395
Look, I don't want you guys
to freak out or anything.

13:38.245 --> 13:39.177
But...

13:40.983 --> 13:44.688
And again, I wanna stress
the no-freaking-out part.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.543
<i>After class,</i>

13:52.754 --> 13:54.960
Miss Toola named me
valedictorian.

13:55.710 --> 13:56.370
Oh!

13:59.520 --> 14:00.202
Oh!

14:04.752 --> 14:06.000
So, yeah.

14:06.050 --> 14:08.393
You know, this is what
freaking out looks like.

14:13.843 --> 14:14.400
Mwah.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.610
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

14:17.660 --> 14:20.030
This is incredible.
You should be so proud.

14:21.817 --> 14:22.600
Let's see it.

14:23.850 --> 14:24.672
See what?

14:24.922 --> 14:25.811
The ball.

14:26.011 --> 14:28.650
They still give it to the
valedictorian beforehand, right?

14:28.900 --> 14:29.850
Um...

14:30.518 --> 14:32.500
Miss Toola said
they don't do that anymore.

14:32.750 --> 14:33.600
Oh.

14:33.850 --> 14:34.945
Makes sense.

14:35.919 --> 14:38.140
I mean, after that kid
destroyed it that one time.

14:38.790 --> 14:39.760
What kid?

14:40.726 --> 14:41.496
I don't know.

14:41.546 --> 14:43.230
Some guy went valedictorian,

14:43.280 --> 14:45.715
and he broke the ball
before it even started.

14:48.165 --> 14:50.051
Uh, they had to cancel
the whole thing.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.347
Oh, can you imagine?

14:53.397 --> 14:54.397
Ugh, I don't even want to think

14:54.447 --> 14:56.100
what I'd do if this
all got canceled.

14:57.976 --> 14:59.800
But what happened?

14:59.850 --> 15:01.115
Did they get it fixed?

15:02.138 --> 15:04.263
I don't know,
it was after my time.

15:04.313 --> 15:05.392
Your aunt would know.

15:06.942 --> 15:08.114
Ophelia?

15:08.164 --> 15:08.945
Yeah.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.300
It was someone in her year.

15:12.723 --> 15:14.353
Well, I gotta go.

15:14.403 --> 15:16.340
I'm gonna
go get Muggs.

15:22.400 --> 15:23.280
Next.

15:28.830 --> 15:29.970
Can I help you?

15:30.420 --> 15:31.593
Most certainly.

15:31.643 --> 15:33.277
I require safe passage

15:33.327 --> 15:35.300
through your trunks
to get to the port.

15:35.350 --> 15:39.550
And if I might request
a particularly large trunk.

15:39.600 --> 15:42.335
Uh, you see, this leg
falls asleep

15:42.385 --> 15:44.567
ever since I wrestled a yeti.

15:44.817 --> 15:47.300
You look like the sort of fellow
who'd enjoy this story.

15:47.350 --> 15:49.500
- I was in Tibet...
- Sir, I'm sure it's a super story,

15:49.550 --> 15:51.640
but I have a lot of work
to do. Name?

15:52.090 --> 15:53.155
Right. Of course.

15:53.405 --> 15:56.490
Um, Oren of the Crested Circle.

15:57.340 --> 16:00.900
Or maybe under Oren
of the Troll Guild?

16:01.150 --> 16:04.620
Funny story, I once
accidentally married a troll.

16:05.470 --> 16:06.952
A truly ugly woman.

16:07.102 --> 16:09.900
At least, I think
she was a woman.

16:09.950 --> 16:10.800
<i>A-ahem.</i>

16:11.774 --> 16:13.570
Right.
No time for stories.

16:17.420 --> 16:18.888
It was under Crested Circle.

16:19.238 --> 16:21.888
Unfortunately, with the ball,
there's a pretty long wait.

16:21.938 --> 16:23.380
Uh, you'll be in trunk...

16:24.530 --> 16:25.460
3B.

16:30.110 --> 16:31.450
Another funny story?

16:31.500 --> 16:33.070
Well, a very quick one.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.522
You, see, 3B...

16:34.572 --> 16:37.173
was the name
of my pregnant ostrich.

16:37.223 --> 16:39.912
Three because of
the number of toes.

16:39.962 --> 16:43.080
And B because his name
was originally Franklin.

16:43.130 --> 16:45.500
Now here's where it gets
really crazy.

16:45.550 --> 16:48.420
You see, I say that the
ostrich was pregnant

16:48.470 --> 16:52.600
but in fact, I think he had
ingested a great ball of yarn.

16:57.766 --> 17:01.240
One double latte,
half foam, double cupped

17:01.290 --> 17:02.880
for Blake with
the sensitive hands.

17:02.930 --> 17:04.300
How did you know my name?

17:04.849 --> 17:06.339
Oh, I guess you told me.

17:09.593 --> 17:11.366
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

17:11.415 --> 17:16.099
Is that Bea, Beatrix,
class valedictorian in my shop?

17:16.150 --> 17:17.970
I hate that you know everything.

17:18.020 --> 17:20.800
Haha, what can I say,
I'm gifted.

17:21.450 --> 17:22.686
Hey, what do you say, Muggs?

17:23.929 --> 17:26.099
<i>I say, Bea and I
will take two of your</i>

17:26.150 --> 17:28.850
finest cheeses. And I'll take
mine in here.

17:28.900 --> 17:29.855
And I'll also have

17:29.905 --> 17:30.905
<i>hers in here.</i>

17:38.555 --> 17:39.575
<i>Ah.</i>

17:40.725 --> 17:42.405
<i>Blue cheese.
She knows me.</i>

17:44.761 --> 17:47.040
If... you'll marry me,

17:48.568 --> 17:50.622
I promise not to eat
our offspring.

17:50.872 --> 17:52.010
Oh, so good.

17:53.766 --> 17:55.593
Okay, now, I'm sensing
my queen Bea

17:55.643 --> 17:56.990
wants a chai tea

17:57.040 --> 17:57.993
<i>triple sugar?</i>

17:59.970 --> 18:00.682
<i>Ophelia</i>

18:00.730 --> 18:03.360
knows all
and sees all.

18:07.210 --> 18:08.554
I did not see this.

18:09.404 --> 18:11.414
Dad said this happened
to a kid during your year.

18:11.464 --> 18:12.430
It did.

18:12.980 --> 18:15.354
Great. So, you can tell me
how he got it fixed?

18:16.704 --> 18:17.810
Well, it didn't.

18:19.646 --> 18:20.777
Oh, I'm so dead.

18:21.127 --> 18:22.249
<i>Oh, hey. Hey, hey, hey.</i>

18:22.299 --> 18:24.763
Let's not burn ourselves
at the stake just yet, okay?

18:26.184 --> 18:29.313
Okay. Now, the ball
itself is enchanted

18:29.363 --> 18:31.023
so my magic won't fix it.

18:31.073 --> 18:33.200
<i>But let's see if Jax
has any ideas.</i>

18:33.579 --> 18:34.250
Hey!

18:34.811 --> 18:36.150
Hey, Jax, wake up.

18:40.128 --> 18:41.710
What? What do you want?

18:41.760 --> 18:42.760
I'm sleeping!

18:43.310 --> 18:45.877
<i>Whoa, a talking pumpkin!</i>

18:46.427 --> 18:47.685
How crazy is that?

18:48.347 --> 18:49.970
Beatrix here had
a little accident

18:50.020 --> 18:51.400
with her crystal ball, okay?

18:51.450 --> 18:53.223
So, is there any way
we can get it fixed?

18:53.433 --> 18:57.120
That's the trouble with kids,
always breaking things.

18:57.170 --> 18:59.610
W-hey, Jack,
some answers here, please?

19:00.760 --> 19:01.750
Fine, fine.

19:01.775 --> 19:06.728
Uh, two marshmallows, a lollipop,
and a pinch of blue floss.

19:14.784 --> 19:16.740
The girl will need
three witches.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.135
<i>One to fix each
of the three parts.</i>

19:19.185 --> 19:21.082
One, old and wise.

19:21.132 --> 19:23.233
Another, kind beyond measure.

19:23.283 --> 19:25.693
And the last, pure of love.

19:26.779 --> 19:28.424
How would I find these witches?

19:28.874 --> 19:30.422
I wouldn't even know
where to look.

19:31.472 --> 19:33.400
Once you've solved
the riddle given,

19:33.450 --> 19:36.930
the location of the next witch
will become clear on the map.

19:37.321 --> 19:38.700
I got a better idea.

19:38.750 --> 19:41.650
How 'bout you just <i>tell us
</i> and save some time?

19:41.700 --> 19:44.194
Once the riddle is solved
and the witch seen,

19:44.244 --> 19:46.127
you will be able to
move on to the next.

19:46.177 --> 19:49.193
Now, if you'll kindly excuse me,

19:49.243 --> 19:51.778
I'd like to return to my slumber

19:51.828 --> 19:54.552
unbothered for quite some time.

20:01.402 --> 20:04.115
I don't know, Bea.
That sounds kind of dangerous.

20:04.565 --> 20:06.104
I don't care.
I can do this.

20:06.454 --> 20:08.682
I just need to get this
fixed before the ball.

20:08.732 --> 20:11.770
But you have to promise not to
say anything to Mom and Dad.

20:12.620 --> 20:15.062
Ugh, Bea, this is kind of big, okay?

20:15.112 --> 20:16.700
Have you thought about
just telling them?

20:17.050 --> 20:17.750
I can't.

20:17.800 --> 20:20.363
Mom's too focused on
making this ball perfect.

20:20.813 --> 20:21.720
I'll break her heart.

20:22.570 --> 20:23.750
I just need to fix this.

20:23.800 --> 20:24.660
Hmm.

20:26.822 --> 20:28.300
Please, let me do this.

20:30.750 --> 20:33.055
You'll need some supplies, okay?

20:33.305 --> 20:34.300
You're the best.

20:34.350 --> 20:37.860
Hey, but be careful in those woods.
I know them.

20:39.001 --> 20:40.582
Okay, take this with you,

20:40.632 --> 20:42.371
open it, and read it
when you get there, okay?

20:43.044 --> 20:44.045
In darkest night,

20:44.095 --> 20:45.100
- please help my...
- Hey, Bea.

20:45.150 --> 20:46.915
When you get there.
Not now.

20:57.565 --> 20:58.835
What's this for?

21:00.085 --> 21:01.140
Demons?

21:01.290 --> 21:03.455
Ah, it's cheese
for the little furball.

21:05.682 --> 21:08.209
Marry me.
Right here. Right now.

21:19.759 --> 21:21.580
According to the map,
this is it.

21:25.225 --> 21:26.992
How do you tell
where to go on this?

21:28.030 --> 21:30.630
How come mysterious journeys
never start at the mall?

21:30.680 --> 21:32.778
I mean, it's always got to be
some haunted forest.

21:33.017 --> 21:33.928
<i>Well...</i>

21:34.595 --> 21:37.350
I guess now is as good
a time as any to open this.

21:38.615 --> 21:41.000
I'm just sayin' how much
better would it be goin'

21:41.050 --> 21:42.600
<i>on a journey with a
soft pretzel in the hand?</i>

21:43.050 --> 21:45.658
Ooh! Or maybe we can
get some frozen yogurt.

21:45.908 --> 21:46.851
Bea...

21:46.901 --> 21:48.385
<i>can you get me some
frozen yogurt?</i>

21:49.135 --> 21:51.511
In darkest night,
please help my plight.

21:51.661 --> 21:53.734
Show the way
with glowing light.

21:59.178 --> 22:00.250
Fireflies.

22:00.500 --> 22:03.400
Oh, man. Not fireflies.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.520
What do you got against fireflies?

22:05.970 --> 22:07.156
Are you kidding me?!

22:07.206 --> 22:08.780
I mean, rats and fireflies

22:08.830 --> 22:11.011
have been at war with each
other for centuries!

22:19.361 --> 22:21.420
They seem to want
to help us right now.

22:21.570 --> 22:24.130
<i>My grandpa gave me
two pieces of advice.</i>

22:24.180 --> 22:26.675
<i>Never trust anyone
who's butt glows.</i>

22:26.725 --> 22:28.736
<i>And if you're ever
on a magic journey</i>

22:28.786 --> 22:30.480
<i>to fix a cracked crystal ball,</i>

22:30.530 --> 22:33.170
<i>never, never trust a firefly.</i>

22:33.620 --> 22:35.914
You sure that's what he said?

22:36.364 --> 22:37.688
<i>Yeah, more or less.</i>

22:45.138 --> 22:49.332
<i>Hey, just so you fireflies know,
I got my eye on you.</i>

22:49.582 --> 22:51.950
<i>Don't think about
leading us into an ambush.</i>

22:52.950 --> 22:54.340
Pretty sure they're not.

22:54.390 --> 22:56.708
Hey, Bea, um, do you think
this is gonna work?

22:56.858 --> 22:59.490
It has to.
Everyone's counting on me.

22:59.540 --> 23:03.590
Mom, Miss Toola.
I can't let them down.

23:03.640 --> 23:06.252
Besides, I'm not
letting Jasmine win.

23:06.602 --> 23:07.925
<i>I don't get it, I mean...</i>

23:08.375 --> 23:10.300
if she's the one who
knocked it out of your hand,

23:10.550 --> 23:12.030
why not just tell on her?

23:12.180 --> 23:13.260
Let her take the fall.

23:13.810 --> 23:15.870
No one got remembered
by blaming others.

23:16.820 --> 23:19.924
So that's what this is?
You wanna be remembered.

23:20.574 --> 23:23.593
I take a lot of junk for
only being born half-witch.

23:24.543 --> 23:25.860
I wanna show them that

23:26.110 --> 23:28.652
people like me can do
anything they can do.

23:28.902 --> 23:32.230
Not better, not with excuses.

23:32.580 --> 23:34.977
Just show them that
we're meant to be here too.

23:37.394 --> 23:40.600
Maybe change it for the kids
just starting out born half.

23:41.550 --> 23:43.000
Does that sound stupid?

23:43.784 --> 23:46.343
Not at all. I mean,
that sounds pretty cool.

23:48.132 --> 23:52.177
Hey, Bea, you know
you always got me, right?

23:52.227 --> 23:53.550
You got me too, pal.

23:55.900 --> 23:57.650
Well, where are they going?

23:58.500 --> 24:02.410
Oh, I told you!
Lousy glowing-butt traitors.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.480
It didn't work.
There's nothing here.

24:06.430 --> 24:07.605
What's the map say?

24:17.355 --> 24:21.070
It says, "To become wise,
you must ask the question."

24:24.140 --> 24:25.330
I want to become wise...

24:25.580 --> 24:28.578
I'm... asking the question.

24:29.728 --> 24:30.584
Hmm.

24:30.634 --> 24:32.200
Well, maybe they're
in the bathroom.

24:32.750 --> 24:33.866
Give it a second.

24:34.116 --> 24:35.178
<i>Listen for the flush.</i>

24:35.300 --> 24:36.730
This is crazy.

24:36.780 --> 24:38.650
How are we supposed
to find the Wisdom Witch?

24:38.800 --> 24:40.004
<i>The way you just did.</i>

24:41.654 --> 24:42.790
Who said that?

24:43.740 --> 24:45.118
I did, Beatrix!

24:49.268 --> 24:50.614
The Wisdom Witch.

24:52.764 --> 24:54.340
But how'd you know my name?

24:54.990 --> 24:56.280
I hear all magic.

24:56.330 --> 24:58.264
And there is no magic
more powerful than the

24:58.314 --> 25:00.700
first time a mother
says her child's name.

25:05.050 --> 25:07.995
I asked a question.
That's what the riddle meant.

25:09.645 --> 25:11.250
<i>So, you're the Wisdom Witch?</i>

25:13.644 --> 25:16.432
Among other names, yes,
that's one they've given me.

25:17.560 --> 25:20.686
Then what's your deal, huh?
Uh, you know everything?

25:20.936 --> 25:22.530
Anyone who says
they know everything

25:22.580 --> 25:24.650
proves just how
little they know.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.590
Great. First fireflies.
Now this guy's breaking my brain!

25:30.931 --> 25:34.830
Um, sir, I came here because
I need your help.

25:35.680 --> 25:38.700
Your crystal ball.
You'd like me to help you fix it.

25:39.650 --> 25:41.530
Yes, that's exactly it.

25:41.680 --> 25:42.660
Can you?

25:43.010 --> 25:44.700
I could but...

25:44.750 --> 25:46.666
the real question
you need to decide is if

25:46.716 --> 25:48.710
you want me to fix it.

25:50.460 --> 25:51.385
What?

25:52.435 --> 25:55.750
Two paths:
let's call them Hide or Seek.

26:06.800 --> 26:09.400
Hide fixes part of the crystal...

26:09.450 --> 26:10.974
continuing on your journey...

26:11.024 --> 26:13.300
possibly correcting
the mistake you've made...

26:13.350 --> 26:16.650
sparing any pain to you
or those around you.

26:16.900 --> 26:19.643
That sounds good, right?
Let's do that.

26:19.693 --> 26:21.050
On the other hand,

26:21.100 --> 26:24.265
Seek forces you
to face the situation...

26:24.315 --> 26:27.555
learn from your mistake
and grow as a witch.

26:28.699 --> 26:30.135
Which one is right?

26:31.485 --> 26:33.970
Which side of the coin
is the right side?

26:34.420 --> 26:36.490
Easy. Tails.

26:36.940 --> 26:38.554
W-w-w-w-wait... heads!

26:39.404 --> 26:40.770
I don't like math.

26:41.420 --> 26:43.072
They are just sides.

26:43.222 --> 26:46.032
Neither of them
is right or wrong.

26:57.382 --> 26:59.956
And I can choose
whichever side I want?

27:00.406 --> 27:03.112
Of course.
The journey is yours!

27:04.397 --> 27:06.565
If it's all right with you, sir,

27:06.815 --> 27:08.762
I think I'm gonna
choose to fix the ball.

27:09.012 --> 27:12.270
Well, then, please place
the pieces here in front of me.

27:43.735 --> 27:45.386
I hope I've been
some help to you.

27:45.636 --> 27:48.640
And I wish you well
on your adventure.

27:49.190 --> 27:50.733
Thank you very much.

27:50.983 --> 27:52.850
I really hope
I made the right choice.

27:53.797 --> 27:56.697
Whatever choice you made
was always going to be the right one.

27:57.247 --> 27:59.536
I better get going. Thanks again.

27:59.786 --> 28:01.368
You are most welcome.

28:03.718 --> 28:05.130
<i>Hey, Wis... uh...</i>

28:05.380 --> 28:07.276
Between you and me, um,

28:07.526 --> 28:10.441
how do you feel about the uh,
you know, those fireflies?

28:10.691 --> 28:13.284
I never trust anything
with a glowing butt.

28:13.578 --> 28:15.183
Huahh! You hear that?

28:15.433 --> 28:16.946
You heard that, right Bea?

28:17.099 --> 28:17.904
Right?

28:18.154 --> 28:18.954
Bea?

28:35.300 --> 28:36.372
Aah!

28:36.622 --> 28:39.996
Oh, how good is this morning, Beatrix?

28:40.446 --> 28:41.350
Mwah!

28:41.600 --> 28:43.670
Mmm, as good as any other, Grandma?

28:44.920 --> 28:46.030
What day is it?

28:48.480 --> 28:49.605
Dress day?

28:50.455 --> 28:52.175
- Dress day!
- Dress day!

28:53.950 --> 28:55.923
I'm still in my PJ's.

28:59.473 --> 29:01.330
That's not what I meant, Grandma.

29:05.476 --> 29:07.980
Oh, man. Sucks to be
you today, huh, Bea?

29:09.430 --> 29:10.720
Nice try, Muggs.

29:11.370 --> 29:12.070
What?!

29:22.739 --> 29:25.422
234 Westchester.

29:44.307 --> 29:47.476
Oh! My stars!
Look at you!

29:47.526 --> 29:48.526
It's... it's...

29:49.276 --> 29:50.800
- perfect!
- Perfect!

29:51.517 --> 29:53.234
I can't believe that you're

29:53.284 --> 29:56.310
finally going to be
a full-blown witch!

29:56.460 --> 29:58.092
I'm so proud of you.

29:58.142 --> 30:01.395
Thank you, Mom. I couldn't have
converted without all your help.

30:01.645 --> 30:03.415
As if you were my own.

30:04.365 --> 30:05.771
Now...

30:05.821 --> 30:09.472
What are we going to do about
this one?

30:09.522 --> 30:12.000
Oh, I have a few ideas.

30:27.050 --> 30:29.321

I don't care anymore.

31:26.770 --> 31:32.180
I think this calls for a cup of
Grandma's calming tea!

31:32.230 --> 31:34.656
Oh, what a great idea.
Bea, we'll be right back.

31:34.706 --> 31:36.904
I promise
the perfect gown is here.

31:43.573 --> 31:45.238
Muggs, let's get out of here.

31:46.123 --> 31:48.196
I think you should try on
a few more outfits.

31:48.246 --> 31:51.300
I mean, this place has the best
snacks! I mean, it's really...

31:54.105 --> 31:56.400
Look, Yazzy, it's my 'before' picture.

31:56.650 --> 31:58.120
You kidding me now.

31:59.430 --> 32:00.721
Why are you even
looking at dresses?

32:00.771 --> 32:03.280
I mean, after all, you dropped
your crystal ball, remember?

32:04.279 --> 32:06.452
I didn't drop anything
and you know it.

32:06.502 --> 32:08.548
Sure, you did. You saw her,
didn't you, Yazzy?

32:08.598 --> 32:10.730
When Beatrix clumsily
dropped her ball?

32:11.080 --> 32:12.344
Right, Yazzy?

32:15.499 --> 32:18.311
Okay, want a cup of cheer-up tea?

32:19.461 --> 32:21.074
Oh, hello!

32:21.624 --> 32:22.918
Who's this, then?

32:22.968 --> 32:24.211
Friends of yours?

32:24.261 --> 32:25.745
Hello. Jasmine.

32:25.795 --> 32:27.730
Bebe and I go to the same school.

32:27.780 --> 32:29.220
I take it, you're her sisters?

32:29.670 --> 32:31.600
You have no idea

32:31.650 --> 32:34.100
how many people
make that same mistake.

32:34.250 --> 32:35.557
But no.

32:35.607 --> 32:37.280
I'm her grandmother

32:37.330 --> 32:39.234
and this is her mother.

32:39.484 --> 32:41.372
The mother, the mother!

32:41.422 --> 32:42.722
I've heard so much.

32:42.772 --> 32:44.870
Every witch is talking about you.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.300
I'd just like to say
what an inspiration you are.

32:47.550 --> 32:49.376
Oh, my. Really?

32:49.426 --> 32:52.780
Are you kidding? Born a human
and converted to witchcraft?

32:52.830 --> 32:54.592
So inspirational.

32:54.642 --> 32:57.780
And if that weren't enough, you're
organizing the whole Witches' Ball.

32:57.830 --> 32:58.976
Uh, so jelly.

33:00.197 --> 33:02.620
You hear that, Bea?
I'm jelly.

33:03.681 --> 33:06.580
And can I please be the first to say,
welcome to the family.

33:06.830 --> 33:08.600
Well, thank you.

33:09.350 --> 33:11.070
That is so kind of you to say.

33:11.756 --> 33:13.390
My mother's the head of the
Cauldron Club.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.200
I just know
she'd love to meet you.

33:15.550 --> 33:18.300
Mom, shouldn't we get going?
We've got a lot to do.

33:18.400 --> 33:19.610
Soon, sweetie, soon.

33:19.860 --> 33:21.084
Jasmine...

33:21.284 --> 33:23.750
you say your mother's
the head of the Cauldron Club?

33:23.800 --> 33:24.883
- Mom.
- Right.

33:25.033 --> 33:28.046
<i>Right. Sorry. She's right.
We have a lot to do.</i>

33:28.096 --> 33:29.795
We've still got to rehearse our song.

33:29.845 --> 33:31.716
Can never be too prepared, right?

33:31.766 --> 33:33.977
Oh, I'm sure
it's gonna be incredible.

33:34.027 --> 33:36.173
Say, what song
are you two singing?

33:36.423 --> 33:39.280
Sorry, Jasmine,
we're not telling anyone.

33:40.678 --> 33:42.600
<i>Come on, Bea,
we're all friends, right?</i>

33:42.850 --> 33:44.280
- We're doing...
- Don't!

33:44.330 --> 33:46.046
"The Wand Inside My Hand."

33:46.496 --> 33:48.253
Oh, I love that song.

33:49.803 --> 33:51.200
Unbelievable.

33:51.980 --> 33:53.494
<i>Anyway, I won't keep you</i>

33:53.544 --> 33:54.623
from your busy day.

33:54.673 --> 33:57.490
I just came by to pick up
the dresses for my charity.

33:57.540 --> 33:58.877
Each year, I pick up and deliver

33:58.927 --> 34:00.950
the dresses to witches
who are less fortunate.

34:01.900 --> 34:03.778
Well, isn't that sweet of you.

34:04.728 --> 34:05.950
Just doing my part.

34:11.949 --> 34:12.949
<i>Oh, no!</i>

34:13.000 --> 34:15.010
Bebe, you already
picked your dress, right?

34:15.460 --> 34:17.463
No. Actually, I haven't.

34:17.513 --> 34:18.600
I'm sorry.

34:18.650 --> 34:21.060
I was only trying to do
my best for those needy witches.

34:21.110 --> 34:23.620
If you want, I could take one
back from them for you.

34:24.887 --> 34:26.666
No. You know what, Jasmine...

34:27.542 --> 34:30.724
This dress is fine.
I love this dress.

34:32.474 --> 34:35.244
- Bea, wait...
- Oh, dear!

34:35.893 --> 34:37.284
<i>Poor thing.</i>

34:37.833 --> 34:39.120
Must be the pressure.

34:49.170 --> 34:50.514
Are you kidding me?

34:50.565 --> 34:52.801
What am I even
trying to fix this thing for?

34:52.851 --> 34:56.466
Just so Mom can get all
buddy-buddy with Jasmine's family?

34:59.016 --> 35:01.130
How can she not
see through that?

35:01.180 --> 35:03.235
She was just
trying to humiliate me.

35:04.385 --> 35:05.776
<i>It's not that bad!</i>

35:06.026 --> 35:08.463
I mean, I actually kind of
like the ruffles.

35:08.513 --> 35:09.513
But come on.

35:09.563 --> 35:12.960
<i>We can fix this. I mean, everybody
likes a good comeback story.</i>

35:13.813 --> 35:16.220
<i>Come on, let's get this over with.</i>

35:21.000 --> 35:22.300
Hello again.

35:23.050 --> 35:24.363
Afternoon, sir.

35:24.413 --> 35:27.795
You know, you might just be
the busiest fellow I've ever met.

35:28.245 --> 35:29.510
Funny story...

35:29.560 --> 35:32.741
I once knew a young fellow
just like yourself.

35:32.791 --> 35:36.076
And he broke his leg from
running around so much.

35:36.763 --> 35:39.100
Oh, wait. No, that's not a
<i>funny</i> story.

35:39.250 --> 35:42.690
Sir, if you'll excuse me,
we actually lost a little time earlier.

35:42.740 --> 35:45.373
Oh, ho-ho-ho! Sneaky, sneaky!

35:45.423 --> 35:46.922
I see what you're doing.

35:46.972 --> 35:48.462
What? What am I doing?

35:48.875 --> 35:52.030
It's extraordinary
how hesitant people are

35:52.080 --> 35:54.400
to ask for a warlock's help.

35:54.550 --> 35:56.030
<i>There's really no need.</i>

35:56.080 --> 35:57.765
You have only to ask.

35:57.815 --> 36:01.443
A quick charm, and I'll have
everything here in fast forward.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.110
Please don't!
That's not what I was doing.

36:03.360 --> 36:07.615
I call to the skies
to whistle and scurry

36:07.865 --> 36:11.750
Fast forward in time
along in a hurry.

36:13.900 --> 36:16.620
Ooh, look at it go.
Isn't it wonderful?

36:19.670 --> 36:20.543
Oh.

36:22.393 --> 36:24.152
Well, that's odd, isn't it?

36:24.502 --> 36:27.320
I-I mean the spell
should've worked.

36:28.070 --> 36:30.472
Uh, unless of course...

36:30.722 --> 36:32.130
the trunks were somehow...

36:32.330 --> 36:33.530
Enchanted?

36:35.778 --> 36:36.944
Yes.

36:38.545 --> 36:40.705
Oh... I see.

36:40.755 --> 36:41.660
Well, then.

36:41.710 --> 36:44.376
I have mucked things up a bit,
haven't I?

36:44.826 --> 36:46.472
Yah.

36:55.722 --> 36:57.711
I can't believe
my mom bought that.

36:57.961 --> 36:59.860
I mean, seriously.

37:00.110 --> 37:02.800
"My mom's the head
of the Cauldron Club."

37:03.550 --> 37:06.593
And I assume we aren't
talking about the dress either.

37:06.843 --> 37:09.070
We are definitely not.

37:09.920 --> 37:11.020
Hey, Bea...

37:11.470 --> 37:13.930
if you cast a spell that'd
make my arms longer...

37:13.980 --> 37:16.110
I'd give you a hug.

37:27.643 --> 37:29.390
Looks like this is the start.

37:33.140 --> 37:34.772
"Always be kind."

37:35.322 --> 37:36.823
What kind of riddle is that?

37:37.373 --> 37:40.890
Oh, maybe it's one of those uh,
read-it-backwards thingies.

37:41.440 --> 37:45.166
"Dink eb swalwin", wait...

37:45.916 --> 37:47.100
Did that do anything?

37:48.050 --> 37:50.710
This thing should come
with an instruction manual.

37:52.127 --> 37:54.860
I can't think with that
heat bug just humming.

37:55.310 --> 37:56.710
Cicada.

37:56.760 --> 37:57.780
That's it.

38:02.530 --> 38:03.672
<i>What's it?</i>

38:05.622 --> 38:08.140
A cicada hums whenever
there's magic around.

38:08.490 --> 38:10.400
I thought they hum
because of the heat.

38:11.524 --> 38:14.310
No, that's something
witches used to tell humans

38:14.560 --> 38:17.350
in the old days
to keep us hidden.

38:18.800 --> 38:20.080
There you are.

38:20.530 --> 38:21.704
<i>So now what?</i>

38:21.754 --> 38:24.434
The spell book says
if I eat the cicada,

38:24.584 --> 38:27.560
I'll be able to hone in
on anything magical around.

38:27.810 --> 38:30.080
I'll be able to find
the Kindness Witch easily.

38:30.330 --> 38:32.420
Eeyuck! Chew it quick!

38:32.470 --> 38:34.488
C-cause if it starts to make
that noise in your mouth,

38:34.538 --> 38:35.666
<i>I'm gonna yarf.</i>

38:36.016 --> 38:37.888
I think I have a better idea.

38:40.753 --> 38:43.200
I wish the hold to be
as light as a feather.

38:43.450 --> 38:46.780
Please bind this creature
to my tether.

38:47.887 --> 38:49.880
There you go.
You're all right.

38:50.130 --> 38:51.470
<i>Don't play with your food, Bea.</i>

38:51.520 --> 38:53.300
<i>I mean, just get it
over with already.</i>

38:53.450 --> 38:54.794
I'm not gonna eat it, Muggs.

38:55.044 --> 38:56.480
I put it on a leash spell

38:56.530 --> 38:58.100
like I used to use on my dog.

38:58.350 --> 39:00.140
That way, we'll listen to the hum.

39:00.190 --> 39:03.410
The louder the hum gets,
the closer we are to magic.

39:03.660 --> 39:05.860
<i>Hey! Look at that!</i>

39:06.110 --> 39:07.700
You're making a bug compass.

39:08.750 --> 39:10.986
You know what?
We'll call it compbug.

39:11.036 --> 39:14.584
<i>Oh, no, wait, better yet,
a bug with a...com-compass!</i>

39:14.634 --> 39:16.515
- A compass-bug.
- Come on, this way.

39:37.365 --> 39:39.232
<i>That thing is going crazy!</i>

39:39.582 --> 39:41.890
Okay. I think this is it.

39:41.940 --> 39:44.490
Go on, little fellow.
Release, yes.

39:48.540 --> 39:49.635
<i>Now what?</i>

39:50.485 --> 39:52.313
Uh... no idea.

39:52.463 --> 39:53.860
I was hoping that'd be enough.

39:54.419 --> 39:56.430
Well, the bug was
going crazy here.

39:56.737 --> 39:59.300
Hey, tree!
Fix her busted ball!

39:59.850 --> 40:02.000
Muggs, I doubt that she's gonna...

40:02.350 --> 40:03.290
Whoa!

40:06.529 --> 40:08.853
<i>See? All those times you said,
"Muggs,</i>

40:08.903 --> 40:10.480
"don't yell at the trees."

40:10.530 --> 40:12.195
But screaming at the trees...

40:12.245 --> 40:14.214
Look! Found the Fish Witch.

40:14.464 --> 40:16.200
She's not a fish.

40:16.450 --> 40:17.965
<i>She's a mermaid.</i>

40:20.115 --> 40:21.746
Hello, Kindness Witch.

40:21.996 --> 40:23.726
My name is Beatrix.

40:25.315 --> 40:27.540
And I have a problem

40:27.590 --> 40:30.030
that I was hoping
you could help me with.

40:32.617 --> 40:36.700
I accidentally broke this.

40:38.400 --> 40:42.960
And I was told you may be
able to mend part of it?

40:51.400 --> 40:52.500
Oh, no.

40:52.550 --> 40:55.705
Right? I mean, if she doesn't
want to help us, just say so.

40:56.355 --> 40:59.373
<i>For a Kindness Witch...
that was very rude.</i>

41:00.523 --> 41:03.250
It's not her fault.
She doesn't speak English.

41:09.800 --> 41:12.600
I'm sorry, we can't play right now.

41:13.050 --> 41:14.050
<i>Um...</i>

41:14.600 --> 41:15.805
Eye.

41:16.355 --> 41:17.700
Need.

41:18.437 --> 41:19.600
You.

41:20.050 --> 41:21.460
<i>To.</i>

41:22.021 --> 41:23.000
Fix.

41:23.350 --> 41:24.370
This.

41:26.036 --> 41:30.090
Uh, I'm not sure slower
and louder's the uh, key here, Bea.

41:30.340 --> 41:32.100
Um, you kind of look like
someone who uh,

41:32.150 --> 41:33.482
falls on their head

41:33.732 --> 41:34.600
a lot.

41:35.542 --> 41:39.032
This is hopeless. Come on.
We'll have to find another way.

41:39.782 --> 41:42.423
Hold on.
I speak a little fish.

41:42.673 --> 41:43.830
Let me give it a try.

41:49.780 --> 41:52.346
Uh-oh. I think I said a bad word.

41:59.600 --> 42:01.100
What are they talking about?

42:17.650 --> 42:19.600
Wow! You fixed it.

42:20.653 --> 42:24.185
But I don't understand.
Why did you help me?

42:24.635 --> 42:26.950
I didn't perform
any acts of kindness.

42:34.400 --> 42:36.584
But I didn't eat the cicada.

42:37.534 --> 42:39.393
And I used the leash spell.

42:39.743 --> 42:41.445
That was the act of kindness.

42:43.824 --> 42:46.056
Thank you so much
for helping me.

42:52.706 --> 42:56.416
Muggs, I can't believe it.
We're actually gonna do this.

42:56.566 --> 42:58.320
And there's only one piece left.

42:59.449 --> 43:01.620
But where will you find
a Witch of Pure Love?

43:01.870 --> 43:04.222
I mean, even I know
those are rare.

43:04.472 --> 43:05.960
That's the best part.

43:06.210 --> 43:09.992
My godfather, Oren is the original
Witch of Pure Love.

43:10.142 --> 43:13.306
He's the only one not in the map
'cause he hasn't arrived yet.

43:13.356 --> 43:16.115
Once he gets here,
he'll fix the last piece

43:16.165 --> 43:17.620
and then I'm home free.

43:18.070 --> 43:18.920
Perfect.

43:19.170 --> 43:20.850
You think he could
fix your dress, too?

43:21.100 --> 43:23.194
I don't think anyone's that good.

43:23.444 --> 43:25.700
Come on, I wanna be home
before he gets there.

43:26.150 --> 43:28.230
<i>I wonder how close he is.</i>

43:32.107 --> 43:34.320
Not that we don't appreciate
your helping us, sir.

43:34.370 --> 43:36.452
It's just that
I think it'd be a little safer

43:36.502 --> 43:38.660
with you staying in here
while we get the trunks fixed.

43:38.910 --> 43:40.900
Well, I don't understand.

43:41.050 --> 43:43.000
I feel perfectly safe already.

43:43.050 --> 43:44.996
I meant we'd feel safer
with you in here.

43:45.246 --> 43:48.846
Oh, yes.
Now I completely understand.

43:48.896 --> 43:50.880
Here's some chatter root
for you to call your loved ones.

43:50.930 --> 43:54.010
Oh... funny story about love...

43:54.917 --> 43:56.000
Did you know

43:56.050 --> 43:59.454
that I invented love potions
one through eight?

44:01.684 --> 44:05.240
Oh. I must have told him
that one already.

44:09.690 --> 44:12.081
There, Jasper, my little friend.

44:12.331 --> 44:14.640
What a good little
guinea pig you are.

44:14.890 --> 44:17.570
Now, Daddy needs to make a call.

44:17.920 --> 44:20.514
So I wonder if you could have

44:20.564 --> 44:23.770
a little bit of chat-chatter root.
There we are.

44:23.820 --> 44:25.102
There we are.

44:25.977 --> 44:29.460
And can you call my
goddaughter's home, please?

44:31.010 --> 44:32.000
Hello?

44:32.350 --> 44:33.735
Is anybody there?

44:34.485 --> 44:36.700
Hopefully, somebody can hear me.

44:37.450 --> 44:41.830
I, uh, I'm afraid I've fallen
into a bit of a sticky wicket.

44:42.090 --> 44:46.455
Um, something has caused
the trunks to stop.

44:46.505 --> 44:49.354
What it is exactly, I-I don't know.

44:50.154 --> 44:52.245
Um, but this means...

44:52.295 --> 44:55.460
that I may not be there
in time for the ball.

44:57.682 --> 45:00.436
If someone's there,
could you say something

45:00.486 --> 45:02.830
so I know that you've
received the message?

45:04.980 --> 45:07.184
I put my hand inside the toilet.

45:19.234 --> 45:22.557
Did you tell them
that you could fix it?

45:23.307 --> 45:25.715
I don't think they're interested.

45:27.665 --> 45:29.233
This is terrible.

45:29.483 --> 45:32.118
Trigg, could you have someone
from the wand to pull some strings?

45:32.168 --> 45:33.566
Doing the best I can here.

45:34.116 --> 45:37.488
Yes, hello! Help yourself
to whatever you like.

45:39.338 --> 45:41.175
Come on, buddy,
eat the chatter root.

45:41.725 --> 45:43.137
A really late call.

45:43.187 --> 45:46.090
- Ah, yes, yes.
- Ah, Trigg, is that you?

45:46.140 --> 45:48.588
Yes, sir. Sorry to bug you
at home, but uh...

45:48.838 --> 45:52.220
it seems Oren got himself
into a bit of a situation again.

45:52.670 --> 45:56.814
Ah, let me find my keys.
I'll meet you down at the station.

45:57.464 --> 45:59.540
Okay, I'll see you there.
Thank you.

45:59.790 --> 46:02.620
Okay. I'm gonna head to work.
See what I can do.

46:07.370 --> 46:09.820
- Good luck.
- Hi, sweetie. Bye, sweetie.

46:10.070 --> 46:12.195
- What's going on?
- Oh, hey, there you are.

46:12.245 --> 46:13.600
Uh, we were trying to call you.

46:13.850 --> 46:16.611
I just had some running around
to do before the ball tomorrow.

46:16.761 --> 46:17.677
What's up?

46:17.927 --> 46:21.404
Oren's got himself locked up
at the trunk terminal.

46:22.496 --> 46:24.332
But he'll be here though, right?

46:24.582 --> 46:25.860
Before tomorrow?

46:26.310 --> 46:28.104
We're doing everything we can.

46:28.254 --> 46:29.926
We'll make something work.

46:42.776 --> 46:45.770
If Dad got to Oren by 2:00 today,

46:47.086 --> 46:48.644
he'd still have enough time

46:48.694 --> 46:50.350
to make it here
before the ball, right?

46:50.400 --> 46:51.590
Your dad's doing everything he can.

46:51.640 --> 46:53.880
I know how much it means
to you for Oren to be here.

46:55.775 --> 46:57.314
So, what if we...

46:57.339 --> 46:59.830
Bea, the ball is tonight.
I need to focus on other things too.

46:59.885 --> 47:01.478
I still have a million
of errands to run.

47:01.503 --> 47:03.636
Gabby's picking up more
relatives from the trunk station.

47:03.661 --> 47:06.129
And I still need to see your
Aunt Ophelia to pick up the cake.

47:06.716 --> 47:08.255
I can get the cake.

47:08.411 --> 47:10.278
Really? Would you?

47:10.325 --> 47:12.528
Of course. I'm happy to help.

47:12.553 --> 47:14.120
Oh, that would be a huge help.

47:27.390 --> 47:29.179
Bea, can you help
with the centerpieces?

47:36.104 --> 47:37.237
Perfect.

47:37.502 --> 47:40.580
Oh, before you go,
look what I got.

47:43.764 --> 47:44.764
What is it?

47:44.789 --> 47:46.608
It's for your valedictorian ball.

47:46.678 --> 47:48.600
I ordered it as soon as I found out.

47:48.625 --> 47:50.514
I got one for mine, too.

47:50.542 --> 47:53.808
I was thinking, we could put them
on the mantle next to your dad's?

47:54.839 --> 47:55.910
It's a good idea.

47:56.596 --> 47:57.692
Do you like it?

47:57.747 --> 47:58.963
I know I went a bit overboard.

47:58.988 --> 48:00.721
But I figure, it's only
once in a lifetime

48:00.746 --> 48:03.527
that I get to become a witch
the same day as my only daughter.

48:03.910 --> 48:05.239
It's beautiful.

48:07.379 --> 48:09.035
I'm just so proud of you.

48:12.770 --> 48:14.333
I'm proud of you too, Mom.

48:15.051 --> 48:17.106
Oh, okay, enough of this.

48:17.131 --> 48:19.944
Plenty of time to cry later.
We've got lots to do.

48:24.323 --> 48:27.518
<i>Oh, man. Your mom
got matching platforms made.</i>

48:27.543 --> 48:29.839
<i>Talk about slapping you
in the feelings.</i>

48:29.926 --> 48:31.098
Muggs.

48:31.344 --> 48:33.242
<i>I'm just sayin'.
They look handmade.</i>

48:34.206 --> 48:36.448
I'm telling you, she knew my name,
and she cured my...

48:37.332 --> 48:38.934
Hi, how are you?

48:38.988 --> 48:40.543
- Very well, thanks.
- Good.

48:40.684 --> 48:43.215
Neil, there's your blackberry tea
with a hint of honey, okay?

48:43.254 --> 48:44.394
How did you know my name?

48:44.512 --> 48:47.488
I guess you told me.
Have a nice day.

48:47.637 --> 48:49.637
That's what she said to me.

48:49.699 --> 48:51.605
<i>First off, congrats...</i>

48:51.653 --> 48:54.988
on the first two pieces.
Not easy, and you did it.

48:55.067 --> 48:57.934
Second, I have no idea if
Oren will make it in time...

48:57.959 --> 49:00.063
and third, it can't be me.

49:00.088 --> 49:01.803
I'm a Witch of Bravery.

49:01.828 --> 49:03.664
Okay? I got love for you kid, but...

49:03.689 --> 49:06.624
to find a Witch of Pure Love,
that's a rare find.

49:08.221 --> 49:09.901
Can you at least pretend
not to know what

49:09.926 --> 49:12.066
I'm about to ask
next time I come in?

49:12.104 --> 49:14.018
Would that make you feel better?

49:14.222 --> 49:15.511
No, probably not.

49:15.652 --> 49:18.097
I just... I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

49:18.222 --> 49:22.121
I mean, Oren's the only
Witch of Pure Love that I know.

49:22.222 --> 49:24.410
Yeah, well, relax.
There's still time, right?

49:24.488 --> 49:26.863
Hopefully, he gets there,
he fixes the ball.

49:26.888 --> 49:30.306
You give a great speech.
And everybody has a good time.

49:32.550 --> 49:34.309
What if you asked your dad?

49:35.261 --> 49:37.059
Every witch has a trait.

49:37.198 --> 49:38.823
My dad's an honesty witch.

49:38.862 --> 49:40.511
Grandma's a nurturing witch.

49:42.253 --> 49:44.898
Can't we use Jax
to see into the future?

49:44.923 --> 49:46.432
See if he makes it?

49:46.457 --> 49:49.762
We all know the future
can be changed, right?

49:49.809 --> 49:52.816
Besides, Jax is in
a little bit of a mood.

49:52.843 --> 49:55.468
<i>Huh! I'm not in a mood, madame.</i>

49:55.493 --> 49:58.968
I simply don't understand
why I cannot attend the ball.

49:58.993 --> 50:01.163
Because you are a vegetable.

50:02.716 --> 50:03.771
Oh, I almost forgot...

50:03.796 --> 50:06.357
Ah, the cake. It's in the back.
I'll go grab it.

50:08.349 --> 50:10.146
There's gotta be
another way to fix this.

50:10.232 --> 50:11.458
There is.

50:13.794 --> 50:15.021
What is it?

50:15.966 --> 50:17.373
Why should I tell you?

50:18.068 --> 50:21.146
Because Beatrix makes
a mean pumpkin pie.

50:21.653 --> 50:23.348
And you'd make the meanest one yet.

50:23.400 --> 50:24.979
Well, I never!

50:25.004 --> 50:27.620
You think I'll respond
to these threats?

50:28.111 --> 50:29.432
Both of you stop it.

50:30.193 --> 50:31.514
What is it that you want

50:31.592 --> 50:34.092
I want to go to the ball!

50:34.123 --> 50:36.943
Okay, fine. I'll put you
with the decorations.

50:37.078 --> 50:39.602
Now, please,
tell me the other way.

50:39.680 --> 50:43.149
All right, but I warn you.

50:43.174 --> 50:47.301
This way requires the use of
darker magic.

50:48.106 --> 50:49.465
Oh.

50:49.504 --> 50:50.535
<i>Well, uh...</i>

50:50.560 --> 50:51.855
How much dark
are we talkin' here?

50:51.880 --> 50:55.191
Like, uh, we talkin' murder?
Or just a little jay walking?

50:55.216 --> 50:56.879
You need tears.

50:56.904 --> 51:00.095
Spilled from the one
responsible for the break.

51:00.236 --> 51:03.407
Oh, Jasmine tears.
No problem.

51:03.462 --> 51:04.962
<i>Let's go make her cry.</i>

51:04.987 --> 51:06.580
I don't think I could do that.

51:06.605 --> 51:08.091
Suit yourself.

51:08.144 --> 51:09.644
Enjoy showing everyone

51:09.669 --> 51:11.905
the shattered symbol
of their trust in you.

51:12.823 --> 51:17.706
Well, okay, just for argument's sake,
what would I do with the tears?

51:18.259 --> 51:20.416
Place a tear on the
fractured object...

51:20.441 --> 51:23.197
and the remaining pieces
will be as good as new.

51:23.222 --> 51:24.707
<i>Here we go!</i>

51:24.732 --> 51:26.833
Quick, guard your brain.

51:27.856 --> 51:29.043
Guardia.

51:29.239 --> 51:31.566
Okay, Bea, you are really
gonna like this one.

51:31.591 --> 51:34.207
I put in lots of raisins,
'cause I know you like them.

51:35.693 --> 51:38.803
Wait, why can't I tell
if you like them?

51:40.053 --> 51:42.404
I don't know.
But I do. I love them.

51:44.130 --> 51:46.061
Everything okay, Bea?

51:46.086 --> 51:48.139
Yeah, I just got
a lot on my mind.

51:48.166 --> 51:51.134
I mean, the Ball's tonight,
the broken ball.

51:51.159 --> 51:53.572
Anyway, I better get going.

51:54.512 --> 51:56.708
Okay, well, you tell your mom
I'm gonna close up early

51:56.733 --> 51:58.308
so I can give her a hand, okay?

51:58.379 --> 51:59.535
Will do.

51:59.560 --> 52:01.910
Thanks for the cake,
it looks great.

52:02.388 --> 52:04.528
Uh, a-ahem...

52:04.980 --> 52:08.246
Um, can you bring Jax tonight?

52:08.722 --> 52:10.308
Really? Why?

52:10.333 --> 52:12.980
I sorta promised he could
sit with the other pumpkins.

52:13.005 --> 52:15.310
<i>Oh, yeah, like uh, a
blind date kinda thing.</i>

52:15.335 --> 52:16.685
Oh.

52:40.974 --> 52:42.497
Throw down!

52:56.672 --> 53:00.208
Welcome, everyone, to the
Witches' Ball red carpet  live.

53:00.233 --> 53:02.749
For the past 642 years,

53:02.774 --> 53:05.211
witches and warlocks
have gathered here

53:05.236 --> 53:07.546
to celebrate everything magic.

53:07.609 --> 53:09.422
How's it going inside, Maggie?

53:09.553 --> 53:11.185
Thanks so much, Jann.

53:11.210 --> 53:14.427
It's finally here, the night
we've all been waiting for.

53:14.513 --> 53:16.629
It's the Witches' Ball.
And as you can see,

53:16.872 --> 53:19.271
There's no shortage of
A-list witches this year.

53:19.295 --> 53:21.356
I'm here with Anya,
the Nature Witch.

53:21.380 --> 53:23.950
Come here... Can I ask who
you're wearing tonight?

53:23.974 --> 53:25.974
This is my pet snake, Brandon.

53:26.364 --> 53:27.622
Hold on tight.

53:27.647 --> 53:31.021
We're gonna squeeze every
ounce of fun out of this party!

53:31.147 --> 53:33.943
Well, there you have it, folks.
The annual Witches' Ball.

53:33.998 --> 53:35.138
Back to you, Jann.

53:50.436 --> 53:52.741
Welcome to the Witches' Ball!

53:52.766 --> 53:55.905
My granddaughter's
the valedictorian!

53:56.891 --> 54:00.641
Oh. Welcome to the Witches' Ball.

54:00.666 --> 54:04.696
My daughter-in-law is converting
to a full witch tonight!

54:06.149 --> 54:07.556
What a coincidence.

54:07.581 --> 54:08.852
Our daughter is, too.

54:08.916 --> 54:10.744
And we're very supportive....

54:11.089 --> 54:14.720
and not at all afraid of
what's going on here.

54:16.718 --> 54:21.296
Oh, my! Yes.
You must be Brooke's parents.

54:21.671 --> 54:24.812
I'm Trigg's mother, Gabby!

54:25.976 --> 54:28.483
Oh!

54:28.601 --> 54:31.386
Look, dear,
straight in for the hug!

54:31.792 --> 54:34.113
And... and I support that.

54:34.152 --> 54:38.027
And... I'm not be at all
afraid of what's going on...

54:38.223 --> 54:42.430
and... oh, my, look,
he's flying!

54:42.502 --> 54:43.666
Oh.

54:43.705 --> 54:46.392
Now, some people
might be afraid of that, but...

54:46.416 --> 54:47.517
not me!

54:47.542 --> 54:50.947
Oh, now, you simply
must come with me.

54:50.972 --> 54:54.604
I have to introduce you
to all your new family!

54:57.470 --> 55:00.696
Oh, this is cousin Yuri.
Yuri, cover the door for me.

55:05.955 --> 55:08.807
Excuse me, do you know
where the toilet is?

56:13.943 --> 56:15.130
Thank you so much
for your help.

56:15.155 --> 56:16.364
Oh, and thank you for the cake.

56:16.389 --> 56:17.991
- And thank you for the...
- Okay, okay...

56:18.016 --> 56:19.513
Breathe, breathe.

56:21.419 --> 56:22.982
This place looks spectacular.

56:23.007 --> 56:25.195
I just really want it to be
perfect for Beatrix.

56:25.647 --> 56:27.804
Yeah, well, you did it.

56:28.498 --> 56:29.624
That's her.

56:32.358 --> 56:35.428
Mother, this is Bebe's mom, Brooke.

56:35.522 --> 56:37.874
She organized this whole ball.

56:38.167 --> 56:40.307
Wow, isn't that something.

56:40.776 --> 56:42.503
Had a lot of help.

56:42.831 --> 56:45.331
All right, I'm gonna go
grab some punch, okay?

56:47.217 --> 56:49.725
My dear, I just simply
love that gown.

56:50.114 --> 56:52.895
Thank you.
Yours is spectacular.

56:53.934 --> 56:56.200
You know, I think that
might be the finest

56:56.225 --> 56:58.724
non-royal witch dress
I've ever seen.

56:59.707 --> 57:02.122
Say, where's Bebe?

57:02.500 --> 57:04.165
Yes, where is that girl

57:04.190 --> 57:06.960
who edged out my Jasmine
from valedictorian?

57:09.620 --> 57:13.948
Actually, uh, I'm not sure.
She should've been here by now.

57:14.105 --> 57:16.238
Oh, I do hope nothing's wrong.

57:16.426 --> 57:18.402
I'm sure she's just
taking a little extra time

57:18.427 --> 57:21.340
to make herself
as beautiful as she can.

57:42.117 --> 57:44.797
Give me one good reason
why I should go tonight.

57:44.938 --> 57:48.032
So you can help guide the
airplanes in for a landing?

57:48.057 --> 57:49.328
I mean, seriously...

57:49.353 --> 57:52.735
between this dress,
the stupid broken ball...

57:52.760 --> 57:54.274
and the fact that
I've never even had time

57:54.299 --> 57:56.601
to write a valedictorian speech...

57:57.103 --> 57:59.376
I don't see a reason
why I should go.

57:59.455 --> 58:02.165
<i>You're gonna go
because you deserve this.</i>

58:02.205 --> 58:03.985
<i>And you're gonna go
and give a great speech</i>

58:04.010 --> 58:06.158
because you've earned it.

58:06.221 --> 58:07.299
And you're gonna go

58:07.324 --> 58:10.002
because I wanna eat
sticky, fancy cheese

58:10.027 --> 58:12.338
and no one else
will sneak me in.

58:14.300 --> 58:15.652
All right.

58:15.677 --> 58:18.868
So, uh, what do we do
if Oren can't make it?

58:18.982 --> 58:20.872
I have no idea.

58:20.997 --> 58:25.052
What about the um...
"other option?"

58:25.481 --> 58:26.919
I don't know.

58:27.223 --> 58:30.740
Dad says once you use dark magic,
it's got its way of taking over.

58:31.801 --> 58:34.036
I don't really know
if I wanna go down that road.

58:34.189 --> 58:37.111
But I don't wanna
let everyone down, either.

58:40.213 --> 58:41.268
Dad's back.

58:44.002 --> 58:45.784
Hey, sweetie.

58:45.799 --> 58:48.088
<i>Is that my baby Beatrix?</i>

58:49.049 --> 58:51.213
You did it. You got Oren.

58:51.463 --> 58:52.642
<i>I sure did.</i>

58:52.667 --> 58:54.283
Hello, sweetheart.

58:54.307 --> 58:57.517
Just need a quick drink of water
and we can head to the ball.

58:57.581 --> 58:59.339
I thought you said you did it.

58:59.409 --> 59:00.745
<i>I did.</i>

59:00.769 --> 59:03.003
I got three days worth
of chatter root from work

59:03.028 --> 59:06.096
so now, Oren can come with us,
and he doesn't have to miss it.

59:07.409 --> 59:08.636
Forget it.

59:08.902 --> 59:10.136
I'm not going.

59:14.890 --> 59:16.437
Honey, I am so sorry.

59:17.593 --> 59:18.679
It's okay.

59:19.039 --> 59:20.429
I know you did your best.

59:21.463 --> 59:22.737
No, I mean...

59:25.702 --> 59:28.585
I mean, I'm sorry I didn't
notice you when I walked in.

59:28.667 --> 59:30.855
Ugh... I know.

59:33.089 --> 59:35.167
You're so beautiful.

59:37.736 --> 59:39.127
Are you kidding me?

59:39.152 --> 59:40.799
Look at this dress.

59:41.143 --> 59:42.487
It's perfect.

59:42.706 --> 59:44.362
It's orange.

59:44.943 --> 59:46.490
No, it's you.

59:48.743 --> 59:50.883
Sure, some people
might see this dress

59:50.908 --> 59:53.252
and think it's orange
or it's different.

59:53.338 --> 59:55.096
But I see a dress...

59:55.121 --> 59:56.767
that's proud of not
looking like

59:56.792 --> 59:59.486
the other dresses
you've seen a million times.

01:00:00.426 --> 01:00:03.247
I see a dress that...
despite being made different...

01:00:03.271 --> 01:00:06.629
everyone's gonna see it,
and want to be just like it.

01:00:07.367 --> 01:00:08.687
In fact...

01:00:09.234 --> 01:00:12.539
that dress is the most beautiful
dress that I've ever seen.

01:00:13.492 --> 01:00:15.187
Thanks, Dad.

01:00:16.291 --> 01:00:18.435
So, what do you wanna do?

01:00:19.974 --> 01:00:21.974
I wanna party.

01:00:22.010 --> 01:00:23.471
All right!

01:00:25.190 --> 01:00:28.504
- What do you think of the sleeves?
- Uh, the sleeves could go.

01:01:43.632 --> 01:01:45.483
Wow! Let's hear it
for Spellbound!

01:01:45.508 --> 01:01:48.422
All the way from Norway.
Thank you so much!

01:01:50.397 --> 01:01:51.632
Whoo!

01:01:56.560 --> 01:02:00.162
Well, it looks like
most of us are here now.

01:02:01.217 --> 01:02:04.639
I said "us."
It feels so weird to say it.

01:02:04.826 --> 01:02:07.108
You're one of us now, Brookie!

01:02:14.138 --> 01:02:16.201
Thank you, all of you.

01:02:16.365 --> 01:02:19.842
Uh, as you know,
the Witches' Ball has been held

01:02:19.867 --> 01:02:23.311
every Halloween for
the past 642 years.

01:02:23.843 --> 01:02:25.929
A night where every
witch could celebrate

01:02:25.954 --> 01:02:28.797
his or her own life
without worry or fear.

01:02:29.130 --> 01:02:31.873
And tonight, we have a very
special night celebrating

01:02:31.898 --> 01:02:33.983
witches that have been
around since the beginning.

01:02:39.843 --> 01:02:42.163
As well as welcoming the new.

01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.979
I hope you all enjoy
my big night.

01:02:51.594 --> 01:02:53.931
Uh, traditionally, the
night is started off

01:02:53.956 --> 01:02:55.970
with the new witch
valedictorian speech,

01:02:56.017 --> 01:02:59.086
but as I, uh, I don't
see her anywhere...

01:02:59.181 --> 01:03:02.345
I thought we might as well
keep the entertainment going, so...

01:03:02.369 --> 01:03:03.963
All the way from Carelles,

01:03:03.988 --> 01:03:06.635
oh, no... uh...

01:03:06.660 --> 01:03:08.726
is my new cousin Yuri

01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:11.461
with a special song
he's written for us.

01:03:12.315 --> 01:03:15.285
I-its says, he even
wrote it in English.

01:03:16.253 --> 01:03:17.824
Take it away, Yuri!

You're going to love it.

01:04:40.242 --> 01:04:42.288

- Any luck finding Beatrix?
- Not yet.

01:05:02.777 --> 01:05:05.831
So, you sure this is
what you want to buy into?

01:05:05.941 --> 01:05:07.909
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

01:05:09.558 --> 01:05:12.441
I just wanted to tell you,
great job on the party.

01:05:12.551 --> 01:05:15.379
Thank you, I'm so glad
you're having a good time.

01:05:17.402 --> 01:05:19.519
Say, uh, you cousin there...

01:05:19.544 --> 01:05:21.932
- Oh, yeah, sorry.
- Is he single?

01:05:25.777 --> 01:05:28.230
I'm fairly certain the answer is yes.

01:05:29.816 --> 01:05:31.792
Good evening, Miss Toola.

01:05:31.908 --> 01:05:33.728
Evening, Jasmine, Yazzy.

01:05:34.048 --> 01:05:35.985
Miss Toola, Yazzy and
I were just talking,

01:05:36.010 --> 01:05:37.368
and we wonder
what would happen

01:05:37.393 --> 01:05:39.432
if the valedictorian
didn't show up to the ball?

01:05:39.830 --> 01:05:41.830
Yazzy was really the one asking.

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:44.573
I, of course, was saying
Bebe will for sure be here.

01:05:45.066 --> 01:05:46.847
Well, I guess, technically,

01:05:46.872 --> 01:05:48.902
we'd have to go with
the next person in line.

01:05:49.225 --> 01:05:52.155
Oh, wow, wouldn't that be something.

01:05:52.389 --> 01:05:54.858
Say, who would be next in line?

01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:57.331
Technically, you.

01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:01.730
My goodness, good thing
I prepared a speech, just in case.

01:06:01.839 --> 01:06:03.066
Put it away.

01:06:03.167 --> 01:06:05.214
I was only saying
I was prepared.

01:06:05.239 --> 01:06:07.821
And I'm only saying
there's no need.

01:06:25.244 --> 01:06:26.189
Hey.

01:06:32.483 --> 01:06:34.187
Oh, this is my chance to meet Yuri.

01:06:36.484 --> 01:06:39.281
Oh, you look incredible.

01:06:40.343 --> 01:06:42.327
- Sorry I was late.
- It's okay.

01:06:42.632 --> 01:06:44.273
Any luck getting Oren out?

01:06:45.926 --> 01:06:47.442
Don't worry about me, dear.

01:06:47.467 --> 01:06:49.130
I'm not going to let
a little prison

01:06:49.155 --> 01:06:51.130
stop me from enjoying the night.

01:06:51.270 --> 01:06:53.505
Well, at least,
he'll get to hear your speech.

01:06:53.738 --> 01:06:55.481
Speaking of,
are you ready?

01:06:55.506 --> 01:06:58.872
Oh, I was hoping just to take
some time to get settled first.

01:06:58.897 --> 01:07:00.311
Is that okay?

01:07:00.336 --> 01:07:02.796
Of course, anything goes
at the Witches' Ball.

01:07:02.921 --> 01:07:06.538
Come on, I wanna dance with
the second most beautiful witch.

01:07:09.790 --> 01:07:12.571
So, you figure out
what to do about the ball?

01:07:18.290 --> 01:07:20.056
I'm weighing my options.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:28.472
This is a seriously swanky joint!

01:07:28.497 --> 01:07:30.097
I mean, I feel like
I should always be

01:07:30.122 --> 01:07:32.535
wiping my feet when
I'm in a place like this.

01:07:32.817 --> 01:07:36.098
I'm so nervous.
At least, no one's looking at me.

01:07:36.161 --> 01:07:38.395
Maybe I won't even
have to do my speech.

01:07:40.124 --> 01:07:41.226
<i>Hey, everyone.</i>

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:42.656
Sorry to stop the fun-fun...

01:07:42.688 --> 01:07:45.781
but I just want to let you all know
that Beatrix has finally arrived.

01:07:45.806 --> 01:07:47.844
So she can show everyone
the valedictorian ball,

01:07:47.869 --> 01:07:49.039
and give her big speech

01:07:49.064 --> 01:07:51.758
which I, for one, have been
dying to hear.

01:07:59.073 --> 01:08:00.369
Can I just, uh...

01:08:03.026 --> 01:08:05.322
Um, yes, Beatrix is here.

01:08:05.386 --> 01:08:06.980
But I think we'd all like
to hear another round

01:08:07.005 --> 01:08:09.699
of Yuri's "I Put My Hand
Inside the Toilet?"

01:08:09.800 --> 01:08:11.417
What do you all say?

01:08:16.176 --> 01:08:19.419
One more time, Yuri's
"I Put My Hand Inside the Toilet!"

01:08:22.990 --> 01:08:24.920
♪ I put my hand inside the toilet ♪

01:08:52.952 --> 01:08:54.202

That's you and him, Sara!

01:09:00.908 --> 01:09:02.643
Thank you, Grayson
for one the

01:09:02.667 --> 01:09:05.432
sweetest displays of magic
I've ever seen.

01:09:05.752 --> 01:09:09.760
Next up, Jasmine and Portia
have prepared a poem for us.

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:13.495
And after that, my daughter
Beatrix and I will sing a song.

01:09:17.617 --> 01:09:19.062
Actually, no poem.

01:09:19.087 --> 01:09:21.750
My mother and I
will be doing a song instead.

01:09:21.962 --> 01:09:26.446
Oh, well, let's hear it for
Portia and Jasmine's song!

01:09:34.033 --> 01:09:37.064
I think I'll take a song
over a poem any day, right Bea?

01:09:38.353 --> 01:09:40.205

Oh, yes, of course.

01:10:39.280 --> 01:10:41.992
Just taking a bit of time
to feel down on myself.

01:10:42.070 --> 01:10:43.890
Silly, I know.

01:10:47.166 --> 01:10:48.440
It's not silly.

01:10:49.557 --> 01:10:51.510
I suppose it's no big deal.

01:10:51.685 --> 01:10:54.115
I'll just go up and
explain the misunderstanding.

01:10:54.473 --> 01:10:56.348
Maybe I can even get a laugh.

01:10:56.373 --> 01:10:59.326
Your father's the funny one.
So that would be nice, at least.

01:11:04.502 --> 01:11:06.377
We worked so hard.

01:11:06.707 --> 01:11:08.058
It just would've been something

01:11:08.083 --> 01:11:10.403
to show everyone what
we can do together.

01:11:10.754 --> 01:11:12.231
You and me.

01:11:13.817 --> 01:11:15.817
So, let's show them.

01:11:15.842 --> 01:11:18.966
Show it to them.
They just did it.

01:11:20.389 --> 01:11:22.249
I'm such a fool to
think someone like her

01:11:22.274 --> 01:11:24.451
would let me in to
their little club.

01:11:26.265 --> 01:11:28.062
Do you trust me?

01:11:28.194 --> 01:11:31.359
- Of course, sweetie.
- So then... let's go.

01:11:31.577 --> 01:11:33.030
Come on.

01:11:33.101 --> 01:11:35.741
I want to sing a song
with my mom.

01:11:52.325 --> 01:11:53.700
Oh, thank you.

01:11:53.725 --> 01:11:56.216
 I'm so glad
you got to hear me.

01:12:02.672 --> 01:12:04.602
And now, witches and warlocks,

01:12:04.627 --> 01:12:06.697
my mother and I
will be singing our version

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:09.181
of "The Wand Inside My Hand."

01:12:10.285 --> 01:12:12.511
Bea, this really isn't necessary.

01:12:12.571 --> 01:12:14.149
You sing your parts
the exact same.

01:12:14.174 --> 01:12:15.736
Don't worry about what I do.

01:12:15.805 --> 01:12:19.032
Um, Bebe, I think
everyone just heard this.

01:12:19.079 --> 01:12:21.008
Not like this, they haven't.

01:12:26.377 --> 01:12:28.057

Hey, Anna, I was wondering
if you wanted to dance...

01:14:27.990 --> 01:14:29.630
but I-I already know
that you would say no

01:14:29.655 --> 01:14:31.256
because I have
really sweaty hands

01:14:31.281 --> 01:14:33.101
I mean, if that's,
you're so pretty

01:14:33.148 --> 01:14:35.984
tonight and I-I wouldn't blame you
if you didn't wanna dance

01:14:36.009 --> 01:14:38.116
with someone like me
who has really sweaty hands.

01:14:38.172 --> 01:14:42.476
I-I'm just gonna go and-
and leave you alone.

01:14:42.501 --> 01:14:44.265
Wait...

01:14:44.290 --> 01:14:45.750
I'd like to dance.

01:14:48.962 --> 01:14:50.111
Yes.

01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:01.451
Beatrix, sweetie!

01:15:01.476 --> 01:15:03.670
Look dear, it's Beatrix, the sweetie.

01:15:03.695 --> 01:15:06.038
Beatrix, you look gorgeous!

01:15:06.063 --> 01:15:07.094
Mwah!

01:15:07.119 --> 01:15:10.892
Hi, Nanny, Gramps.
Are you guys having fun?

01:15:10.917 --> 01:15:13.185
I'm having the best
time of my entire life!

01:15:15.491 --> 01:15:17.468
What potion did you give them?

01:15:17.694 --> 01:15:20.139
Honestly, it was peppermint tea.

01:15:20.191 --> 01:15:22.668
I think they just needed
and excuse to let go.

01:15:24.254 --> 01:15:26.512
Look at me, I'm a witch!

01:15:28.551 --> 01:15:31.981
Looks like I'll be on
grandparent duty all night.

01:15:32.074 --> 01:15:34.840
Old people. They're weird.

01:15:35.941 --> 01:15:37.590
Good luck.

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:49.472
Well?

01:15:49.497 --> 01:15:50.277
I asked.

01:15:50.302 --> 01:15:52.441
She said I would get it
if she didn't show up,

01:15:52.466 --> 01:15:53.590
but she did.

01:15:53.652 --> 01:15:55.489
Forgive me.
Who is it that told me...

01:15:55.544 --> 01:15:57.372
No, correction,
assured me...

01:15:57.397 --> 01:15:59.629
that she was going to be
named valedictorian?

01:15:59.654 --> 01:16:00.506
I didn't think...

01:16:00.531 --> 01:16:02.513
How many of my friends
are here tonight?

01:16:02.576 --> 01:16:04.060
A lot.

01:16:04.085 --> 01:16:05.913
And do you know how
embarrassing it was

01:16:05.938 --> 01:16:08.077
for me to sing that song
that you insisted...

01:16:08.102 --> 01:16:10.250
just to have them follow
with the same one?

01:16:10.313 --> 01:16:11.914
Yes, but...

01:16:14.547 --> 01:16:17.242
Royals make it happen.

01:16:34.157 --> 01:16:35.391
Now what?

01:16:35.782 --> 01:16:37.805
I'm gonna go see
if she's okay.

01:16:38.461 --> 01:16:39.735
Seriously?

01:16:40.657 --> 01:16:42.165
She needs someone.

01:16:52.435 --> 01:16:53.560
Congratulations.

01:16:53.669 --> 01:16:55.841
You caught me. I'm crying.

01:16:55.974 --> 01:16:58.458
Perfect time to tell me
what a mess I am.

01:16:58.631 --> 01:17:00.162
Perfect time for you
to rub how much better

01:17:00.187 --> 01:17:01.967
you are
than me in my face.

01:17:01.992 --> 01:17:03.305
You already have it all,

01:17:03.330 --> 01:17:05.132
you might as well
take this moment too.

01:17:10.493 --> 01:17:11.688
What are you doing?

01:17:12.805 --> 01:17:14.509
I'm hugging you, silly.

01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:15.868
Why?

01:17:16.244 --> 01:17:18.025
'Cause you need it.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.629
Do you have any idea how
hard it is to compete with you?

01:17:29.442 --> 01:17:31.098
Are you serious?

01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:35.861
Every night, I wish I could
wake up and be you.

01:17:37.807 --> 01:17:39.635
I'm sorry I broke your ball.

01:17:39.901 --> 01:17:41.588
I was just jelly.

01:17:41.893 --> 01:17:45.659
I'm sorry I put that dead fish in
your backpack in the 5th grade.

01:17:45.713 --> 01:17:47.237
You did?

01:17:48.104 --> 01:17:50.729
Yeah, I put it in your
flower backpack.

01:17:50.956 --> 01:17:53.127
I've never had
a flower backpack.

01:17:58.150 --> 01:17:59.689
So, what now?

01:18:00.525 --> 01:18:02.025
I don't know.

01:18:02.087 --> 01:18:03.564
Are we friends?

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:07.337
I'm all right with that
if you are.

01:18:08.767 --> 01:18:10.501
So...

01:18:10.705 --> 01:18:13.009
are we a hard no on
getting those tears out of her?

01:18:13.034 --> 01:18:14.040
What?

01:18:14.065 --> 01:18:16.798
It was dark magic
to fix the ball.

01:18:16.854 --> 01:18:19.221
I needed tears from
the one who caused it.

01:18:19.697 --> 01:18:21.424
It was a dumb idea, anyway.

01:18:21.449 --> 01:18:22.581
I'll do it.

01:18:23.956 --> 01:18:25.080
What?

01:18:25.768 --> 01:18:27.292
It's the least I can do...

01:18:27.317 --> 01:18:29.065
after all I've done.

01:18:36.123 --> 01:18:38.795
For once an enemy,
but now a friend

01:18:38.943 --> 01:18:41.764
Take what you need
to help make amend.

01:18:51.573 --> 01:18:53.026
<i>Nothing's happening.</i>

01:18:53.332 --> 01:18:56.144
You might need more tears.
Hold on, I'll try again.

01:18:59.483 --> 01:19:01.178
That's not the problem.

01:19:02.248 --> 01:19:03.592
<i>What is it, then?</i>

01:19:04.402 --> 01:19:06.183
It's me.

01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.722
Miss Toola gave me this ball.

01:19:09.852 --> 01:19:13.641
And the first thing I did was gloat
and throw it in you face.

01:19:14.790 --> 01:19:18.032
I was blaming you all along,
when all this time...

01:19:18.525 --> 01:19:20.228
it was my fault.

01:19:22.127 --> 01:19:25.690
<i>Okay, make with the tears.
Come on, let's see 'em.</i>

01:19:26.793 --> 01:19:28.778
I'm not gonna fix this.

01:19:29.618 --> 01:19:31.611
<i>We came all this way.</i>

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:35.665
I know. Thank you.
Both of you.

01:19:37.342 --> 01:19:39.732
But I need to make this right
without magic.

01:19:53.638 --> 01:19:57.192
<i>Now that you have passed
all of your many tests...</i>

01:19:57.310 --> 01:20:00.529
proving that you are,
in fact, worthy...

01:20:00.591 --> 01:20:04.443
I present to you,
this crystal ball.

01:20:04.658 --> 01:20:08.830
A symbol of all that we are.

01:20:08.958 --> 01:20:11.739
And a constant reminder
of the powers

01:20:11.764 --> 01:20:14.161
that you now hold inside you.

01:20:14.646 --> 01:20:16.841
Not to be abused...

01:20:16.866 --> 01:20:18.912
but celebrated.

01:20:19.396 --> 01:20:22.177
Handed down from
those before...

01:20:22.286 --> 01:20:23.997
to you.

01:20:24.638 --> 01:20:26.958
Please rise.

01:20:27.367 --> 01:20:30.641
No longer as Brooke the mortal...

01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:34.766
But as Brooke...
the witch!

01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:37.313
Whoo! That's my girl!

01:20:39.366 --> 01:20:41.046
We love you, Brookie!

01:20:46.551 --> 01:20:48.082
Thank you all so much.

01:20:48.184 --> 01:20:49.848
I couldn't be happier.

01:20:49.872 --> 01:20:53.231
I mean, unless my daughter
was named valedictorian.

01:20:53.256 --> 01:20:55.693
Oh, actually, I guess I could, then.

01:20:56.780 --> 01:20:58.999
Ladies and gentlemen,
witches and warlocks...

01:20:59.024 --> 01:21:01.962
I present to you this year's
class valedictorian,

01:21:01.987 --> 01:21:04.600
Miss Beatrix Steinberg!

01:21:20.092 --> 01:21:21.209
Thank you.

01:21:22.521 --> 01:21:25.865
I didn't really prepare
a speech for today.

01:21:26.685 --> 01:21:30.178
Well, because I thought
today would never happen.

01:21:32.157 --> 01:21:34.282
Not only because I
always assumed I wasn't

01:21:34.307 --> 01:21:37.486
as good as some of
the other witches...

01:21:38.978 --> 01:21:41.588
but because I wasn't
born a full witch.

01:21:43.291 --> 01:21:45.275
I remember when
I saw my dad fly

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.026
for the first time
on his broom.

01:21:47.096 --> 01:21:49.791
And I couldn't wait till
I was old enough to do it too.

01:21:50.057 --> 01:21:54.166
And then, when I was old enough,
I just couldn't do it.

01:21:54.562 --> 01:21:56.351
I'd watch all the other witches

01:21:56.376 --> 01:21:58.929
and they had mastered it
after a few tries.

01:21:59.718 --> 01:22:01.914
But I just didn't have it in me.

01:22:04.547 --> 01:22:05.954
But every time I fell off,

01:22:05.979 --> 01:22:08.345
I had so many people
helping me back up.

01:22:08.509 --> 01:22:11.205
Not only witches
like my Aunt Ophelia...

01:22:11.267 --> 01:22:13.478
or warlocks like my godfather, Oren...

01:22:13.548 --> 01:22:15.939
or even powerful men
like my father...

01:22:17.601 --> 01:22:19.272
but my mother...

01:22:19.702 --> 01:22:21.655
my grandparents.

01:22:21.804 --> 01:22:25.554
People that would never be able
to do what I was complaining about.

01:22:25.626 --> 01:22:28.556
But trying to help me make it
just to see me happy.

01:22:29.814 --> 01:22:31.767
That's when I realized...

01:22:31.855 --> 01:22:35.144
Real magic wasn't casting spells
or waving your wand.

01:22:35.449 --> 01:22:37.894
It was showing people
that you care.

01:22:38.378 --> 01:22:40.660
Because without
that love behind me

01:22:40.685 --> 01:22:43.098
I'd just be a kid with a broom.

01:22:44.532 --> 01:22:47.250
So, that's why
I hope you could...

01:22:48.985 --> 01:22:52.673
all find it in your heart
to forgive me for letting you down.

01:22:57.985 --> 01:22:59.929
<i>I tried to get it fixed.</i>

01:23:00.031 --> 01:23:01.945
I went to the Wisdom Witch...

01:23:01.970 --> 01:23:04.800
I got help from
the Kindness Witch, but...

01:23:04.978 --> 01:23:08.900
I checked the map and
there's no Pure Love Witch.

01:23:14.441 --> 01:23:16.199
Check it again.

01:23:24.765 --> 01:23:26.984
I don't understand.

01:23:27.148 --> 01:23:29.523
Why didn't you
show up in here before?

01:23:30.383 --> 01:23:32.375
I wasn't a witch then.

01:23:32.547 --> 01:23:35.461
I guess it turns out my trait is
Pure Love.

01:23:58.928 --> 01:24:01.771
Jasmine, where do you think
you're going?

01:24:01.865 --> 01:24:04.662
I'm gonna go hug my friend
because she needs it.

01:24:04.717 --> 01:24:07.092
- You will do no such thing, young...
- Hey!

01:24:08.261 --> 01:24:10.393
You need to start being
nicer to your daughter.

01:24:10.418 --> 01:24:12.268
She's the only one you have.

01:24:16.507 --> 01:24:19.100
And you need to start
being nicer to me.

01:24:19.765 --> 01:24:23.296
You're absolutely right.
I do. Come on.

01:24:39.465 --> 01:24:42.168
<i>Miss Toola.</i>

01:24:42.311 --> 01:24:44.959
<i>Miss Tooi-let</i>

01:24:45.256 --> 01:24:47.865
Too-la

01:24:47.936 --> 01:24:49.897
Toilet.

01:24:50.127 --> 01:24:51.893
I can live with Miss Toilet.

01:24:51.918 --> 01:24:53.197
Toilet!

01:24:55.674 --> 01:24:56.713
Toilet.

01:24:59.137 --> 01:25:00.371
Pretty good party, huh?

01:25:06.814 --> 01:25:09.181
I think your grandparents
had a good time.

01:25:09.274 --> 01:25:13.774
Yes, yes, we all had
a wonderful time!

01:25:14.532 --> 01:25:16.173
I'm converting.
Let's get started.

01:25:16.198 --> 01:25:18.681
- Give me a wand!
- I'll take two!

01:25:24.292 --> 01:25:26.112
I'm super proud of you, you know.

01:25:26.456 --> 01:25:30.136
What for?
You're the one that fixed it.

01:25:30.433 --> 01:25:32.144
A bunch of years from now,

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:33.872
when I'm old and
thinking about today,

01:25:33.897 --> 01:25:36.067
I'm not going to
remember a broken ball.

01:25:36.606 --> 01:25:38.848
I'm going to remember
that my daughter...

01:25:38.872 --> 01:25:42.160
was brave enough
to stand up in front of everyone

01:25:42.185 --> 01:25:44.536
and admit that she made a mistake.

01:25:46.488 --> 01:25:48.637
And that's all that's
ever going to matter.

01:25:59.407 --> 01:26:02.875
No, no, this way, come, come...

01:26:05.719 --> 01:26:06.587
<i>Yowza.</i>

01:26:06.612 --> 01:26:08.236
I better go give her a hand.

01:26:08.261 --> 01:26:11.048
- You want me to help?
- Nah, I got this. See you at home.

01:26:19.485 --> 01:26:21.258
I guess we did it.

01:26:21.282 --> 01:26:25.180
Yeah, I guess we did,
didn't we?

01:26:25.205 --> 01:26:27.274
You know, I couldn't have
done it without your.

01:26:27.543 --> 01:26:29.605
Of course, I know that.

01:26:29.630 --> 01:26:32.652
I mean, no one else knows that
because you...

01:26:32.676 --> 01:26:35.651
you know, kinda forgot to
include me in your little speech there

01:26:35.676 --> 01:26:38.129
but you know... it... it's cool.

01:26:38.309 --> 01:26:41.629
I'm sorry Muggs, but I didn't
exactly have time to prepare it.

01:26:41.678 --> 01:26:43.677
"And thanks to Muggs."

01:26:43.709 --> 01:26:46.584
See, that's easy.
Even through the blubbering.

01:26:46.740 --> 01:26:49.131
"They helped me on my broom.

01:26:49.156 --> 01:26:50.865
"Oh, and Muggs...

01:26:50.889 --> 01:26:55.092
the special-est, the bravest,
the most awesome rat in the world...

01:26:55.117 --> 01:26:58.920
who's got a perfectly reasonable
hatred of fireflies!

01:27:01.099 --> 01:27:03.349
Uch. Here.

01:27:03.498 --> 01:27:04.857
Wait a minute.

01:27:04.951 --> 01:27:07.115
Is that stinky cheese?

01:27:07.482 --> 01:27:08.795
The stinkiest.

01:27:08.819 --> 01:27:10.694
I was going to
give it to you tomorrow...

01:27:10.718 --> 01:27:12.475
but I can't take this anymore.

01:27:12.608 --> 01:27:14.819
Well, uh...
I take it all back.

01:27:16.077 --> 01:27:17.413
Oh, you're the best!

01:27:17.601 --> 01:27:19.343
Thank you, Bea.
You're the best ever!

01:27:21.530 --> 01:27:23.437
I love you, Bea.

01:27:43.950 --> 01:27:45.489
Rise and shine, sir.

01:27:45.637 --> 01:27:48.551
We managed to fix the magic
and no one was hurt, so.

01:27:48.651 --> 01:27:51.682
I decided that there was no
reason to get the police involved.

01:27:53.214 --> 01:27:55.354
Oh, thank you, good sir.

01:27:55.379 --> 01:27:57.262
You are most kind.

01:27:57.287 --> 01:28:00.214
If ever you need
the services of a warlock,

01:28:00.238 --> 01:28:02.737
Please don't-
if for example...

01:28:02.769 --> 01:28:04.707
you were to go on
a dragon quest...

01:28:04.732 --> 01:28:07.511
That's not necessary. That's
something I'll never be on.

01:28:07.536 --> 01:28:10.568
Well, if you do, and
if you need assistance...

01:28:10.593 --> 01:28:12.677
please don't hesitate to call.

01:28:12.701 --> 01:28:14.029
Okay then.

01:28:16.216 --> 01:28:17.193
Ooh.

01:28:17.218 --> 01:28:20.021
I have created a bit of
a mess, haven't I?

01:28:20.241 --> 01:28:21.851
Here, let me fix it for you.

01:28:21.876 --> 01:28:23.804
No, it's no problem.

01:28:36.231 --> 01:28:39.357
I'll just put myself back in here.

01:28:54.339 --> 01:28:56.386
