1
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,916
My name is Lin.
I grew up outside of the city.

2
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,500
I like studying, reading manga,
and I have a dream.

3
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:28,416
I want a boyfriend
just like the girls in the comic.

4
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,291
Someone sweet and romantic...

5
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:33,500
Happy Valentine's Day!

6
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:38,083
Someone manly wouldn't be bad, either.

7
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,125
Lin, are you okay?

8
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:55,125
I'm okay.

9
00:00:55,958 --> 00:00:58,000
There are just three of us in our family.

10
00:00:58,083 --> 00:00:59,000
NGOR POCHANA

11
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:01,000
My brother-in-law, Kieng.

12
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,458
He makes amazing Raad Na
and owns his own restaurant.

13
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:06,416
He's very kind but very blunt.

14
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,583
Kieng! One Pad See Ew, please.

15
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:12,833
Do you know what
my secret ingredients are?

16
00:01:12,958 --> 00:01:14,666
-What?
-First, an ass.

17
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:15,625
What?

18
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,125
-Second, wine.
-Seriously?

19
00:01:18,958 --> 00:01:20,375
Ass and wine. A swine.

20
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:21,541
So it's pork.

21
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,791
I won't eat just because of that joke.

22
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:28,416
The second member is someone
who always troubles me.

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,791
His name is Due, Kieng's son.

24
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:32,916
He's technically my nephew.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,291
His dream is to become
a runner on the national team,

26
00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:40,666
but what I don't understand is

27
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:43,458
why he always finds a way
to interrupt my love life.

28
00:01:52,583 --> 00:01:53,583
Hey!

29
00:01:55,166 --> 00:01:56,166
Due!

30
00:02:08,166 --> 00:02:09,166
Who is that?

31
00:02:09,791 --> 00:02:11,541
When I asked him why,

32
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:14,916
he told me
to consider him my bodyguard.

33
00:02:19,291 --> 00:02:22,000
Look at that. Nice skin. Very pretty.

34
00:02:26,625 --> 00:02:27,583
Shit!

35
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:29,625
Who did that?

36
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:35,041
He not only has a problem with me,
but also his dad.

37
00:02:40,625 --> 00:02:41,958
Why do you run so much?

38
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:45,000
Shouldn't you be studying?

39
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,041
Listen. If you can't get
into engineering or medicine,

40
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,375
-I will stop paying for your schooling.
-Really, Dad? Medicine?

41
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,541
My GPA is only 1.4.

42
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,458
Then I have a plan for you.

43
00:02:57,958 --> 00:02:59,458
You take over my restaurant.

44
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,291
I'll give you my recipes, everything.

45
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:06,208
-That's the plan.
-No, it's not.

46
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,333
Due!

47
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:10,250
Come on, arguing again?

48
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,833
I'm not arguing with him.
I'm teaching him a lesson.

49
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,791
Come on. You've got
a packed restaurant waiting. Let's go now.

50
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,458
How did you get this one?

51
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,791
I tripped during the race.

52
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:32,458
You tripped and still won a gold medal.

53
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:33,625
You are pretty good.

54
00:03:33,708 --> 00:03:35,791
Hell, yeah.

55
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:38,458
Funny though...

56
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,750
Dad never said that.

57
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:46,250
What's so funny?

58
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,458
You're the only one
with an accent around here.

59
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:52,416
Is it ever going to go away? Country boy.

60
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:57,375
Because of his stubbornness,
he decided to run away from home.

61
00:03:57,458 --> 00:04:01,750
He got a sports scholarship
and went to college in Bangkok,

62
00:04:01,833 --> 00:04:04,250
without having to ask
his dad to support him.

63
00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,291
4 YEARS LATER

64
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:06,708
I got into nursing school,

65
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:10,583
and now work as
a physical therapist in Bangkok as well.

66
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:15,000
All right, we have a try-out today.

67
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,958
Today's highlight, my honored guests,

68
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,708
is Due, our reigning champion,
also known as Mr. Due, the Speed.

69
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:23,125
Ready.

70
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:27,875
Another rising star to watch out for
is a newbie, Mr. Game.

71
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,791
We shouldn't underestimate him.

72
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:33,208
Because if we did,
we probably wouldn't see him.

73
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:35,250
-Smart and strong.
-Set.

74
00:04:35,333 --> 00:04:37,541
Is Game going
to beat our reigning champion?

75
00:04:38,875 --> 00:04:40,916
Here we go, everyone!

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,541
Look at them go.

77
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,416
Due is in the lead. He's in first place.

78
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:48,375
Game's right on his heels.

79
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,583
Now he's passing Due!

80
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,000
Due is now in fourth place.

81
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,500
Still in fourth.

82
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,333
He's fifth now.

83
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:56,916
Still in fifth.

84
00:04:57,416 --> 00:04:58,916
What the hell?

85
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,666
Son of a bitch, he lost!

86
00:05:01,875 --> 00:05:04,125
Shit! I bet a lot of money on him.

87
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,916
LOVE AND RUN

88
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,625
There.

89
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:39,250
Did your mother-in-law cook like this?

90
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:41,000
I follow every detail of her recipe.

91
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:45,208
I even learned how
she would breathe while cooking.

92
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:46,458
How did she breathe?

93
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,666
She inhaled, then exhaled.

94
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,000
-Sounds familiar.
-Sure.

95
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,500
Is this what you made Due do?

96
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,583
Do everything the same as you.

97
00:06:03,666 --> 00:06:07,833
Now he's run away,
and we have no idea where he's gone.

98
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,833
Hello, customers!

99
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:21,375
Today, we have
a special promotional offer for you.

100
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:25,625
Palm oil is normally 25 baht per bottle.
Today, it's 100 when you buy four.

101
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,916
One hundred!

102
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,250
Not only that,

103
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:37,708

So take out your wallets...

111
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,583
Come on in.

112
00:06:51,666 --> 00:06:56,375
This offer is for today only!

113
00:06:58,458 --> 00:07:02,041
You two have been working
part-time here for almost four years.

114
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,875
Don't you want to go back to school
and get a college degree?

115
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,125
You can work here full-time
and earn more money.

116
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:11,083
The reason I dropped out
was to get back on my feet.

117
00:07:11,166 --> 00:07:12,666
-Yeah.
-Nonsense.

118
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:17,666
I wouldn't have hired you if you weren't
related to my wife. You know?

119
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,500
-I'm here because of a family connection?
-Not me, right?

120
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,000
You both are just the same.

121
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:38,458
You ate all of this?

122
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,500
Shit!

123
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,250
Well, you're late.

124
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,208
What the hell is wrong with you?

125
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:48,833
It's delicious.

126
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,250
What's up?

127
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:56,166
Stay still.

128
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,541
Damn, she's so pretty!

129
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:07,583
So many places to eat here.
I've never been here before.

130
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,250
Should have come here long ago.

131
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,500
What the hell is wrong with you?

132
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,041
That's my aunt.

133
00:08:22,666 --> 00:08:24,166
Seriously?

134
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:25,958
Seriously.

135
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,458
-Why don't you go say hi?
-That's crazy!

136
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:33,791
If she sees me, she will tell my dad.
He will drag me home.

137
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:34,916
Let's go.

138
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,833
I'm gonna get something
before we head out.

139
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,916
Sure.

140
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,041
Lin!

141
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:51,458
Do you still read these mangas?

142
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:54,000
Why not? It's fun.

143
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,750
Look, this one's Silly Girl's Last Love.

144
00:08:57,833 --> 00:09:00,333
It's my favorite book
since its last issue.

145
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:03,291
I especially love the last scene
when she had no one left,

146
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:07,041
standing alone
in a field of purple flowers.

147
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:10,333
Then the guy came out of nowhere
and embraced her.

148
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,750
He said, "You are not alone."

149
00:09:15,583 --> 00:09:18,333
I believe I will meet
a guy like this one day.

150
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:20,875
How can you still daydream?

151
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,416
Don't good guys only exist in novels?

152
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,291
There might not be many,
but I believe they do exist.

153
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,166
PHYSICAL THERAPY BUILDING TWO

154
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:53,958
Hi, Mr. Man, back again?
What brings you here today?

155
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:55,666
You know, musician's life.

156
00:09:56,541 --> 00:10:00,416
I play at Ratchada at 9:00,
Ratchavipa at 10:00, 11:00 at Ratchayo.

157
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Then after midnight at Bucalo.

158
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:06,666
I actually had to go to Bangklo
this morning, but my body said no.

159
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,083
Why do I need to know this?

160
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,625
Patient information. For your benefit.

161
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,541
Not really, sir.
Please get your blood pressure checked.

162
00:10:23,208 --> 00:10:24,166
My shoulder hurts,

163
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,458
so I'd like some physical therapy.

164
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,125
The same nurse, please.

165
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:30,708
Lin.

166
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,625
Lin is working
with another patient right now.

167
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,125
I happen to be free. I can do it.

168
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:41,291
For someone like me, you can't.

169
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,041
-When will Lin be free?
-I'm not sure.

170
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:51,625
I feel like you're not really
cooperating with me.

171
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,041
You do?

172
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,666
-Nurse.
-Yes?

173
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,625
It's sucking me in!

174
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,666
It got tighter!

175
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,000
-Nurse!
-What are we gonna do?

176
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,625
Nurse! Help! Nurse!

177
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,500
-Who are you calling?
-Nurse!

178
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,166
-Who the hell are you then?
-Shit, that's me.

179
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,250
Calm down. Please stay still.

180
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,291
What is this thing?

181
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,333
It's to check your blood pressure.

182
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,958
Mr. Man...

183
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,625
THERAPIST: MEEN PROMMONTREE

184
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:41,833
Are you done here?

185
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,916
Can you do me now?

186
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:49,833
I'm sorry, but I'm leaving now.

187
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:52,375
Perfect.

188
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:54,500
Can I give you a ride like last time?

189
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,500
What about your shoulder?

190
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,375
It still hurts,

191
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,333
but I don't care about my shoulder...

192
00:12:01,416 --> 00:12:02,958
I care more about my heart.

193
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,375
Does he know what he looks like?

194
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,458
Please wait for me here.
I'm gonna get my stuff.

195
00:12:09,541 --> 00:12:11,083
Lin, what the hell is this?

196
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:14,791
Why are you letting
this silly-faced guy follow you around?

197
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,458
Don't you know how to say no?

198
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,500
I already said no,
but he keeps persisting.

199
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,625
But you let him go out with you anyway.

200
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:23,583
It's not like we go out together.
He just follows me around.

201
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:27,791
What? How about this?
Instead of saying no, say yes.

202
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,291
You want a boyfriend, right?

203
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:32,708
Shouldn't we at least have standards?

204
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,375
Ready?

205
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:38,208
You don't have something else to do?

206
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:40,541
I have you.

207
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,458
Maybe today you don't have to

208
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,166
because I have to buy stuff
at many places.

209
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,708
No problem. I'll carry stuff for you then.

210
00:13:00,708 --> 00:13:01,916
Good Luck, Lin.

211
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:10,083
I'm gonna go change.

212
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,750
Let me take care of that.

213
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,416
Can I ask you something?

214
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,041
Do you have a type?

215
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,333
I've never really thought about it.

216
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,000
If you had to think about it?

217
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,375
Do we have to?

218
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,750
Let me do the thinking for you.

219
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,041
Firstly, he should be a sharp businessman.

220
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,291
Secondly, a manly athlete.

221
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,666
Thirdly,

222
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:10,083
an eccentric musician.

223
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:16,458
I think I'd like
someone manly like an athlete.

224
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:19,375
So you like sweaty guys?

225
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:24,750
I said, "manly like an athlete."
Not sweaty.

226
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:29,916
-Someone active and nice.
-I see.

227
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,583
This might be the last time
I get to walk you home.

228
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,958
I don't think I can from now on.

229
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,541
Really?

230
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,000
-That's really okay.
-Because...

231
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,916
I'm moving into
the same apartment building.

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,083
What?

233
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,416
Damn! That's creepy.

234
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,000
Are you happy?

235
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,958
-I think I'm shocked.
-Why?

236
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,166
I'm only moving
into the room opposite yours.

237
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,916
Opposite room?

238
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:15,416
Lin.

239
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,666
Trust me,

240
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:28,625
he's moving so he can be
in the same apartment as her.

241
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:31,041
He'll get her within two months,

242
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:32,750
or two weeks at the earliest.

243
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,791
If he uses the pill, then two days.

244
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,583
Could even be tomorrow night with force.

245
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:39,750
He's coming to get your auntie!

246
00:15:39,833 --> 00:15:41,750
Son of a bitch! Stop aggravating me!

247
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,083
-Hello.
-Why a mixed-gender apartment?

248
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:57,250
-What?
-There are many only-women apartments

249
00:15:57,333 --> 00:15:58,875
that auntie can stay in.

250
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,083
It's dangerous here.

251
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:02,291
Bangkok is much more dangerous
than you think.

252
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,416
-Wait!
-What if something happened to her?

253
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,958
-Due!
-Think about it, Dad.

254
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,250
What the hell?

255
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,541
Shit, what's going on here?

256
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,791
Are you surprised?

257
00:16:36,458 --> 00:16:39,125
Please don't tell me this is because...

258
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:43,291
No, I didn't just change
to match your type.

259
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:47,708
This is a side of me
that no one has seen before.

260
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:50,958
It's open for you to see.

261
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:52,541
Well...

262
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:53,666
Here!

263
00:16:55,958 --> 00:17:00,708
This is a Garmin watch,
the latest model to monitor your heart.

264
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:05,791
I don't know why, every time I listen,
I only hear, "Lin, Lin, Lin..."

265
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,000
Well,

266
00:17:10,833 --> 00:17:12,750
the weather is getting hot.

267
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:18,416
What do you think you're doing?

268
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,583
I'm spraying mineral water.

269
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,791
Don't you think this is too much?

270
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:26,500
The more the better.
So you can look into my heart.

271
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:31,083
You tattooed my name?

272
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,208
No, I just wrote it.

273
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:42,916
Did I hurt you?

274
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,083
No, I was pretending. Was it good?

275
00:17:45,625 --> 00:17:47,916
Why are you doing this?

276
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,125
I just wanted
another glimpse of your face.

277
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,875
But for real,
why are you knocking on my door?

278
00:17:56,041 --> 00:18:01,416
I just moved in, so I'd like to borrow
some plates, utensils...

279
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,583
And I'd like to eat inside too, please.

280
00:18:05,541 --> 00:18:09,625
I can lend you the plates and cutlery,
but you coming in...

281
00:18:09,708 --> 00:18:12,000
I live alone.
I don't think that's appropriate.

282
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:15,833
-But I don't mind.
-I do. I'm sorry.

283
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:26,291
Shit. What is it this time?

284
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,208
Due!

285
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:44,208
Where have you been all this time?

286
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,458
Don't you know
your dad is worried about you?

287
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,791
Where are you staying?
What have you been up to?

288
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,041
-What?
-Did you graduate?

289
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:55,000
One question at a time, please.
I don't know how to answer.

290
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,416
Just answer. Any of the questions.

291
00:18:58,125 --> 00:18:59,125
Fine.

292
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:03,958
I work with a Japanese company
in the IT department.

293
00:19:04,041 --> 00:19:05,458
I live with a friend.

294
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,541
I stay away because I don't want
to answer all these questions.

295
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,791
You asked if I graduated. No, I didn't.
I dropped out.

296
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,708
Why? You should at least get a degree.

297
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:19,583
Well, I'll tell you later. Later.

298
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,833
Not like this. Come on.

299
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,208
Hello, auntie.

300
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:30,041
My name is Men. I'm his friend at work.

301
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:34,541
All this time,
I've been taking good care of him.

302
00:19:34,625 --> 00:19:36,166
More importantly,

303
00:19:36,958 --> 00:19:37,833
I'm still single--

304
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:41,375
Probably will be forever, right?

305
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,791
My number is 09--

306
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:45,291
Eleven, 12, 1150. Whatever!

307
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,375
How do you know where I live?

308
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,875
You are so out of date.

309
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:58,500
Just take a quick look
at Google these days.

310
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,375
That's crazy.

311
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,541
Shit.

312
00:20:14,833 --> 00:20:16,625
Oi!

313
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:30,041
Have you been living alone all this time?

314
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,166
Of course.

315
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:34,375
-That's good.
-What do you mean?

316
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:39,541
It's good that you live alone.

317
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,125
Your dad is calling!

318
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,083
Don't pick up!

319
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,000
-Hello?
-Too late.

320
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:54,833
Lin?

321
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,041
Why did you do that?
Don't tell him I'm here.

322
00:20:57,125 --> 00:20:59,166
-I don't want to lie.
-Lin?

323
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,416
Just talk.

324
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,083
Can you hear me?

325
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,000
What's up?

326
00:21:04,083 --> 00:21:05,791
So Due called me...

327
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,500
What did he say?

328
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:11,958
He was scolding me for letting you
live in a mixed-gender apartment.

329
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:13,250
Where did you see him?

330
00:21:14,958 --> 00:21:16,416
See him? Where?

331
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,416
What is up with you, Lin?

332
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,916
Can you hear me?

333
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,458
Lin?

334
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:25,375
Can you hear me?

335
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,750
It's upside down!

336
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:28,541
Hello?

337
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,250
I can't read!

338
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:32,541
What is going on with you?

339
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:37,458
I think he must have gotten
the wrong person.

340
00:21:37,541 --> 00:21:38,833
Got the wrong person?

341
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:40,416
How is that possible?

342
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,958
Well, that's true. How is that possible?

343
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,875
Are you drunk, or am I just confused?

344
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,500
Well...

345
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:49,458
Did you see him or not? Tell me.

346
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:53,375
Well, I have to go now.

347
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,625
If something comes up, call me.

348
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:57,958
Something's come up now.
That's why I called.

349
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,916
That's true.

350
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,583
That's it then.

351
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:03,666
"That's it" what?

352
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,833
Still don't know anything.

353
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,500
Kieng, I need to talk to you.

354
00:22:08,583 --> 00:22:12,166
-What about? I'm busy.
-What?

355
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:14,041
What a prick.

356
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:25,166
Wait.

357
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:28,791
Let me ask you one more thing.

358
00:22:28,875 --> 00:22:31,708
-What?
-Why did you move here?

359
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,416
I'll tell you when it's time.

360
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:47,541
So, when was the last time
someone hit on you?

361
00:22:49,375 --> 00:22:50,916
Yesterday afternoon.

362
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,083
Who was it?

363
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,625
I'm not sure who he is.

364
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:56,750
Could be a musician or an athlete.

365
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:04,750
Is there anyone else besides that guy?

366
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,750
What's up? Why do you ask?

367
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:12,416
Why not? Do you have someone or not?

368
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:17,041
Wait, why? Having someone
is supposed to be a good thing.

369
00:23:17,125 --> 00:23:19,208
Do you want a boyfriend that much?

370
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:21,791
What is wrong with wanting a boyfriend?

371
00:23:22,375 --> 00:23:26,708
Nothing wrong,
but maybe you don't need to hurry.

372
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,833
I'm a grown woman.

373
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:31,375
You don't need to follow me around
and dictate my life.

374
00:23:31,458 --> 00:23:36,541
Come on, being alone
isn't that bad in this day and age.

375
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:52,791
Hi, what's up?

376
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:56,541
I sent you a new song. Play it now.

377
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:57,875
Yes, ma' am.

378
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,500
-Auntie!
-What?

379
00:24:10,625 --> 00:24:13,958
-Where's the towel?
-It's in there.

380
00:24:16,958 --> 00:24:18,500
Found it.

381
00:24:47,291 --> 00:24:48,833
So sexy.

382
00:24:50,041 --> 00:24:52,125
You wanna see more?

383
00:24:54,666 --> 00:24:57,041
If you dare.

384
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:05,333
I thought so.

385
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:12,000
How is it, living with your pretty auntie?

386
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:14,458
What is it like?

387
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:18,375
Nothing.

388
00:25:19,666 --> 00:25:21,500
Why?

389
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,000
Let me tell you something.

390
00:25:23,083 --> 00:25:26,083
What more can you do
to keep people from flirting with her?

391
00:25:26,166 --> 00:25:29,166
You can't be with her all the time.

392
00:25:39,125 --> 00:25:43,125
I admire his dedication.

393
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,750
Following you around all the time.

394
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:49,958
He got here so early today.
You have to see him.

395
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,375
I don't know what else to do.

396
00:26:04,166 --> 00:26:07,083
I'm going to clean your skin
with alcohol. May I?

397
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:10,416
You don't need to ask me
because, as far as you're concerned,

398
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,500
you can do anything with my body.

399
00:26:17,416 --> 00:26:18,583
It's a little cold.

400
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:19,625
Refreshingly so.

401
00:26:26,833 --> 00:26:27,875
Other side.

402
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:44,416
If you're going to touch me this much,
maybe we should go shower together.

403
00:26:44,875 --> 00:26:46,791
I'm gonna attach the device.

404
00:26:48,916 --> 00:26:50,083
Mood ruined.

405
00:26:52,041 --> 00:26:53,250
May I?

406
00:26:59,625 --> 00:27:01,541
Devices attached.

407
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,041
Lin, I'm gonna head out.

408
00:27:12,375 --> 00:27:15,166
What is this thing? It's everywhere.

409
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:18,625
It's an electric
muscle stimulation device.

410
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:26,541
Is there a way to treat this
with your hands on my body?

411
00:27:26,625 --> 00:27:28,833
You're fine. We don't have to.

412
00:27:29,625 --> 00:27:30,625
Too bad.

413
00:27:30,708 --> 00:27:34,166
I shouldn't just carry my guitar.
I should carry the whole drum set.

414
00:27:35,166 --> 00:27:36,583
Lie down, please.

415
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,916
If it hurts, please let me know

416
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,833
because our skins are quite different.

417
00:27:49,916 --> 00:27:53,208
If you have sensitive skin,
the electricity can be too strong...

418
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,333
It could have some side effects.

419
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:57,500
The word sensitive doesn't apply to me.

420
00:27:57,583 --> 00:28:00,458
I can take anything.

421
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:04,541
Well then, I'll just turn it up a notch.

422
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,083
Bring it on.

423
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:11,083
I set the timer for about 15 minutes.

424
00:28:11,166 --> 00:28:14,833
I'll come back when the alarm rings.

425
00:28:14,916 --> 00:28:18,000
But if you can't take it,
press the button here.

426
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,958
Keep that away from me.

427
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,875
I just want you close to me.
That's enough.

428
00:28:25,208 --> 00:28:29,000
Okay, then I'll put it right here.

429
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,875
Excuse me.

430
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,333
Will you sit with me for 15 minutes?

431
00:28:36,916 --> 00:28:40,916
I don't feel like being alone.

432
00:28:56,708 --> 00:29:00,000
Well, I'm gonna excuse myself.
I need to answer a text.

433
00:29:00,083 --> 00:29:01,291
You can answer here.

434
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:04,125
-It's okay.
-It's okay.

435
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:05,250
It's really okay.

436
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:07,708
So who is okay and who is not okay?
I'm so confused.

437
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:12,791
I mean, it's okay
if you answer your text here...

438
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:16,750
But it's not okay for me
if you go outside.

439
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,375
Well, she's out.

440
00:29:27,666 --> 00:29:29,041
What are you up to?

441
00:29:29,583 --> 00:29:33,041
You know, you just saved my life.

442
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,500
Why? What happened?

443
00:29:36,041 --> 00:29:38,875
Nothing. Just a weird patient.

444
00:29:39,375 --> 00:29:42,125
I got out of it to answer your text.

445
00:29:47,416 --> 00:29:49,125
Shouldn't have bragged so much.

446
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:58,000
Ann...

447
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,500
I'm taking a week off
to make offerings at the temples,

448
00:30:01,583 --> 00:30:02,750
nine temples to be exact.

449
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,208
Follow your heart.

450
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:07,583
Temples aren't my thing.
A host bar is more like it.

451
00:30:07,666 --> 00:30:08,875
By the way,

452
00:30:08,958 --> 00:30:14,333
the maintenance guy said
the A2 stimulator is not broken.

453
00:30:14,416 --> 00:30:16,500
The broken one is number A1.

454
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,875
Where is A1 now?

455
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:42,583
Jum.

456
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:43,875
I smell something burning.

457
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,125
-I think...
-Oh, my God.

458
00:30:53,125 --> 00:30:56,250
Jum! The patient!

459
00:30:59,833 --> 00:31:02,666
This is the A1 that we're looking for!

460
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:04,500
Who sent them the A2?

461
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,916
Me, me!

462
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,583
How can it be you? It's gotta be a nurse!

463
00:31:09,666 --> 00:31:10,833
Me dying!

464
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,000
Oh, my God!

465
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:13,291
What should we do?

466
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,708
-I can't turn it off.
-What then?

467
00:31:20,375 --> 00:31:22,083
The circuit breaker!

468
00:31:22,458 --> 00:31:24,208
-Okay.
-Quick!

469
00:31:27,041 --> 00:31:28,083
Shit!

470
00:31:28,958 --> 00:31:30,875
Now power for the whole building is out!

471
00:31:30,958 --> 00:31:33,000
What do we do now?

472
00:31:33,083 --> 00:31:34,083
Turn it on!

473
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,125
Wait--

474
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,708
Now off!

475
00:31:38,791 --> 00:31:39,916
Off now.

476
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,875
Shit, turn it on!

477
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:46,250
Jum, why didn't you pull the plug?

478
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,083
-Okay, okay.
-Shit!

479
00:31:56,166 --> 00:31:57,500
He's still alive.

480
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:02,500
Since you are okay now,

481
00:32:02,583 --> 00:32:06,333
you can change and then go home.

482
00:32:08,958 --> 00:32:10,291
Wait.

483
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:11,875
Where is Lin?

484
00:32:13,166 --> 00:32:14,500
She's on her break.

485
00:32:15,333 --> 00:32:16,666
When is she coming back?

486
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:20,958
She's not. She has to tend to other cases.

487
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:24,833
Still asking for the girl. Unbelievable.

488
00:32:29,291 --> 00:32:30,958
We should be glad he didn't die.

489
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:33,875
If he had, his spirit would be here,
following you.

490
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:37,916
I heard about a new student coming
to do research. They said he's cute.

491
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,958
Can't be as cute as my doctor, Dr. Eak.

492
00:32:41,041 --> 00:32:42,583
Here he comes.

493
00:32:43,583 --> 00:32:46,541
-Hello, Doctor.
-Hello.

494
00:32:48,625 --> 00:32:51,083
Why are you here? Get back to work.

495
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:54,291
I'm almost done.

496
00:32:54,375 --> 00:32:55,208
Slut.

497
00:32:57,375 --> 00:33:01,958
So we were wondering...

498
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:06,000
Why are you here so often?

499
00:33:06,083 --> 00:33:09,083
Actually, I want to be here every day.

500
00:33:09,708 --> 00:33:10,750
Oh, my.

501
00:33:11,416 --> 00:33:13,708
Excuse me. I have to go back to work.

502
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,833
I'll try to come by every day.

503
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,083
Yes, Doctor.

504
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,625
Don't work too hard.

505
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,291
It's the right room.

506
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:38,500
Who's there?

507
00:33:41,833 --> 00:33:43,208
Oh, it's Man.

508
00:33:43,291 --> 00:33:44,125
Lin.

509
00:33:46,416 --> 00:33:47,375
Who is this guy?

510
00:33:47,458 --> 00:33:50,250
This is my nephew.

511
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:54,041
Oh, nephew!

512
00:33:54,125 --> 00:33:57,041
My name is Man. I live right across.

513
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,125
Call me Uncle Man.

514
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,000
Give me a hug.

515
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,458
No need to push. I don't mind at all.

516
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:13,250
-Lin and I are--
-Stop.

517
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,333
-No need to be shy.
-Is there something you need?

518
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:19,041
Yes, there is.
I'm a guy who cares about health,

519
00:34:19,125 --> 00:34:21,250
and I got some healthy stuff for you.

520
00:34:21,708 --> 00:34:23,458
Thank you.

521
00:34:23,916 --> 00:34:27,666
Where are you going?
Since you don't live alone anymore,

522
00:34:27,750 --> 00:34:31,375
can I come in?

523
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:33,666
And we can have a meal together.

524
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:38,833
I'd like to get to know
your nephew better, too.

525
00:34:50,041 --> 00:34:51,916
Coming.

526
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,375
How do you know this guy?

527
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,458
He's a patient at the hospital.

528
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:57,041
Here we go.

529
00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:01,333
Wait. Where is the water?

530
00:35:07,708 --> 00:35:09,333
Uncle Man.

531
00:35:09,416 --> 00:35:13,458
Your armpit hair is so close,
it's merging with my nose hair.

532
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:16,958
I didn't think you'd mind. I'm sorry.

533
00:35:21,666 --> 00:35:22,541
Thank you.

534
00:35:28,833 --> 00:35:32,000
That is a detox drink for your health.

535
00:35:32,083 --> 00:35:35,000
It cleanses your small intestines
to your large intestines.

536
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:37,083
Health comes from within.

537
00:35:37,166 --> 00:35:39,000
I must tell you. It's very good.

538
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:41,666
And this is all organic.

539
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,833
It makes your skin glow and look radiant.

540
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:47,750
Fills your body with healthy antioxidants,
delays aging, and helps you stay young.

541
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:49,916
Just the way I like, forever.

542
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,666
Would you like some, dear nephew?

543
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:00,833
Try this.

544
00:36:00,916 --> 00:36:02,166
I have quite a lot.

545
00:36:04,916 --> 00:36:07,208
It's in the veggies now.

546
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:08,125
It's not in.

547
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,375
It's so in!

548
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:13,541
I'm sorry.

549
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:15,583
Well, I'm eating this one then.

550
00:36:15,666 --> 00:36:16,833
You're going to eat that?

551
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:21,541
Of course, my armpit hair is also organic.

552
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,083
Very safe to eat.

553
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:32,125
When are you leaving, Uncle?

554
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:35,583
Leaving? We need to finish eating.

555
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:38,666
So you'll leave when we finish?

556
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,500
All right. Okay.

557
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,708
Are you okay?

558
00:36:58,375 --> 00:36:59,708
What do you think?

559
00:37:01,958 --> 00:37:03,583
Are you free tomorrow?

560
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:06,625
I wanted to ask you
to bring some stuff to the hospital.

561
00:37:07,375 --> 00:37:10,458
Lots of stuff. Is that okay?

562
00:37:13,833 --> 00:37:15,375
Where are you going?

563
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,291
Getting some grilled pork.
I need some meat.

564
00:37:23,041 --> 00:37:24,833
I heard you're getting grilled pork.

565
00:37:24,916 --> 00:37:26,416
I'd like to go, too.

566
00:37:28,833 --> 00:37:29,791
Nope.

567
00:37:34,791 --> 00:37:36,000
Where?

568
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:37,791
Right inside.

569
00:37:44,125 --> 00:37:46,833
Hi, Doctor. You're here so early.

570
00:37:46,916 --> 00:37:50,375
I'm here for a patient. Are you alone?

571
00:37:50,458 --> 00:37:51,750
Where do I put these?

572
00:37:52,583 --> 00:37:53,833
On the table.

573
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:57,708
The others are coming.
Have you eaten anything?

574
00:37:57,791 --> 00:38:00,208
-Would you like some coffee?
-Which side of the table?

575
00:38:00,291 --> 00:38:01,583
Any side.

576
00:38:02,833 --> 00:38:04,708
Left or right?

577
00:38:05,666 --> 00:38:07,916
Any side. Just put it down.

578
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:11,000
I'll leave you
to take care of your things.

579
00:38:11,083 --> 00:38:12,083
I'm going to work.

580
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,041
Oh...

581
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,875
I'm sorry.

582
00:38:15,958 --> 00:38:18,083
My nephew lacks etiquette.

583
00:38:18,166 --> 00:38:20,375
I asked him to help, and now it's a mess.

584
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:21,458
It's all right.

585
00:38:31,916 --> 00:38:33,250
I'm sorry.

586
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:41,041
I'm late.

587
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:43,000
That's okay. I just got here too.

588
00:38:43,083 --> 00:38:46,416
Besides borrowing your papers today,

589
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,916
I'd like to shoot
a physical therapy video.

590
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,458
Sure.

591
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:56,166
What are you doing here?

592
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,208
Are you...

593
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:01,125
I remember you.

594
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:03,458
You lost your title to me
during my freshman year.

595
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:04,708
You!

596
00:39:05,250 --> 00:39:07,166
What are you doing here?

597
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,000
He's my relative. My nephew.

598
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:12,666
You are Lin's nephew?

599
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,750
Yeah.

600
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:16,416
You look older than her.

601
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,458
You want to bring it on?

602
00:39:20,583 --> 00:39:21,708
Such a small world.

603
00:39:21,791 --> 00:39:25,625
I'm doing my research here,
and Lin is helping.

604
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,583
Who cares?

605
00:39:29,208 --> 00:39:33,083
So I haven't seen you
since my second year.

606
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:38,208
I work, okay? I have to work,
so I dropped out. Get it?

607
00:39:38,291 --> 00:39:39,625
Is that so?

608
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,666
I didn't see you for your graduation.

609
00:39:43,833 --> 00:39:46,333
When are you coming back?

610
00:39:46,958 --> 00:39:49,708
Don't you have
something else to talk about?

611
00:39:49,791 --> 00:39:53,833
Okay, we're going to shoot a video, right?

612
00:39:54,083 --> 00:39:56,666
Wait for me in room two, okay?

613
00:39:57,250 --> 00:39:58,125
Okay.

614
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:01,833
What video?

615
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:05,416
He just told us. It's for his research.

616
00:40:07,916 --> 00:40:10,833
I'm gonna start now. First position.

617
00:40:10,916 --> 00:40:14,833
This is for someone who has
muscle paralysis in the facial area.

618
00:40:14,916 --> 00:40:17,333
We'll start from the forehead.

619
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:19,083
Raise your eyebrows like this.

620
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,625
And for someone who has this condition,

621
00:40:24,708 --> 00:40:28,250
they won't have any wrinkles here,
and we would do this...

622
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:33,375
in order to relax the muscle.

623
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,583
Next, we ask the patient to smile,
grin like they're super happy.

624
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:47,000
Is that your grin? Okay.

625
00:40:47,083 --> 00:40:49,375
Then we would massage, like this.

626
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,500
Next, pucker your lips like this.

627
00:40:57,875 --> 00:41:00,416
This is how we stimulate.

628
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:05,375
All done.

629
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:11,458
We support them with our hands, like this.

630
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,125
From what I gather,

631
00:41:23,375 --> 00:41:27,000
you seem to have a very healthy body.
You're truly an athlete.

632
00:41:27,083 --> 00:41:29,500
Well, I'm not that healthy.

633
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:32,750
Did you know that this research
has taken me to many places,

634
00:41:32,833 --> 00:41:35,291
but this place is the most impressive one.

635
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:36,833
Because of you.

636
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:40,166
Because of me?

637
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:43,625
You're very good and very pretty.

638
00:41:45,291 --> 00:41:46,583
Thank you.

639
00:41:46,666 --> 00:41:48,375
Are you free tomorrow?

640
00:41:48,458 --> 00:41:50,333
I have an assignment from the university.

641
00:41:50,416 --> 00:41:52,416
They want me
to shoot a video to teach people

642
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,083
how to practice physical therapy.

643
00:41:55,291 --> 00:41:56,541
Tomorrow?

644
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:59,125
Please, Lin. Please.

645
00:41:59,208 --> 00:42:01,125
It's at the park nearby.

646
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:03,166
I'll buy you lunch.

647
00:42:04,125 --> 00:42:06,333
I think I can go.

648
00:42:06,416 --> 00:42:08,791
And you don't have to buy me lunch.

649
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:15,750
The freshman kid that we lost to?

650
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:19,500
-The world is really small.
-Yeah.

651
00:42:20,458 --> 00:42:21,708
This sucks.

652
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:23,958
Does he like your aunt too?

653
00:42:25,166 --> 00:42:26,458
How would I know?

654
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:29,208
Why are you taking it out on me?

655
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:39,666
-Very good.
-Cute, right?

656
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:41,833
What are you watching?

657
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:43,791
Look at this.

658
00:42:43,875 --> 00:42:47,791
She's making videos
to sell vitamins online.

659
00:42:47,875 --> 00:42:51,166
Who can take these vitamins?

660
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,833
Everyone can.

661
00:42:52,916 --> 00:42:55,541
Only one month,
and your skin will be radiant.

662
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:57,791
You can say goodbye to your ugly face.

663
00:42:57,875 --> 00:43:00,208
Bitch. How do you make a sale
with that mouth?

664
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,541
Did you know the hospital
is offering scholarships to employees?

665
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,958
You can apply
for a scholarship to England.

666
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:12,333
You only need to submit a form,
and if you're suitable,

667
00:43:12,416 --> 00:43:14,958
it's two years of free education.

668
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:16,833
No need to take an exam?

669
00:43:16,916 --> 00:43:20,083
No. I wouldn't apply
if it required an exam.

670
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,291
I would eat so many foreign sausages
if I got to go.

671
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:27,208
What do you say, Lin?

672
00:43:27,291 --> 00:43:30,000
It's too far. I don't want to go.

673
00:43:30,083 --> 00:43:32,000
There is no place like home.

674
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:35,666
Suit yourself.
Stay here and enjoy your hometown.

675
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:40,375
Nothing is that hard.

676
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:43,916
Listen to the the guru.

677
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,791
You don't have to do it by yourself.

678
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:53,791
How's that?

679
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,708
Haven't you heard?

680
00:43:55,791 --> 00:43:59,625
In order to defeat your enemies,
you need to befriend them first.

681
00:44:06,250 --> 00:44:08,208
Thank you!

682
00:44:08,916 --> 00:44:12,125
All right.
We need to interrupt this performance.

683
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:16,625
The restaurant has asked us to promote
only good things for our customers.

684
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:19,083
Our hot promotion for today!

685
00:44:19,708 --> 00:44:24,291
Order one Fameson, get one Dorson free!

686
00:44:26,083 --> 00:44:29,375
Dorson is a whiskey
that helps the gentlemen.

687
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:32,750
With 69 exclusive ingredients.

688
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:36,041
You don't need Viagra anymore.

689
00:44:36,125 --> 00:44:40,708
This will turn a boy in to a man...
down there.

690
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:44,625
Turn a needlefish into an anaconda!

691
00:44:46,833 --> 00:44:50,958
You just enjoy yourself
and let the drink do the work.

692
00:44:51,416 --> 00:44:55,208
It will be hard to control at first,
but once you get the hang of it...

693
00:44:55,291 --> 00:44:58,500
A wild horse to a unicorn!

694
00:44:58,583 --> 00:45:01,958
We can control it as we want!

695
00:45:02,041 --> 00:45:03,125
Give me that.

696
00:45:21,458 --> 00:45:23,375
What brings you here, dear nephew?

697
00:45:26,583 --> 00:45:30,875
I need to ask you for some advice.

698
00:45:32,375 --> 00:45:33,916
You've come to the right place.

699
00:45:36,916 --> 00:45:39,666
Well, I think this might upset you.

700
00:45:40,875 --> 00:45:41,708
What is it?

701
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:47,083
-Someone is hitting on my aunt.
-What? Are you serious?

702
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:48,666
I'm serious!

703
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:51,666
And he doesn't deserve her!

704
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:55,041
That's right!
You mean I deserve her, right?

705
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:02,958
I mean, you need to do something.

706
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:09,166
Are you okay?

707
00:46:09,250 --> 00:46:10,750
It's the rage.

708
00:46:12,916 --> 00:46:16,291
So, everyone, the first position
we're gonna do is this.

709
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:19,708
It helps strengthen your back.

710
00:46:20,125 --> 00:46:21,833
You can do it at home.

711
00:46:21,916 --> 00:46:27,083
And your family could help you.

712
00:46:29,125 --> 00:46:30,208
Hello, Uncle Man.

713
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,083
Where are you?

714
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,083
I'm in the bathroom.

715
00:46:35,583 --> 00:46:37,291
I'm not ready.

716
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:38,833
What's wrong?

717
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,875
Yesterday, I drank Dorson.

718
00:46:44,958 --> 00:46:46,500
What about it?

719
00:46:48,166 --> 00:46:49,541
I'll show you on the camera.

720
00:46:51,791 --> 00:46:52,833
Shit!

721
00:46:52,916 --> 00:46:54,666
Okay, let's get started.

722
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:57,666
Draw your knees up like this.

723
00:46:57,750 --> 00:47:00,375
Okay. And lift your back.

724
00:47:00,458 --> 00:47:02,500
That's it. Support here.

725
00:47:02,583 --> 00:47:04,041
So close again.

726
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:06,708
Game and my aunt are getting close again.

727
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,500
Go down. Go down.

728
00:47:11,333 --> 00:47:14,541
Do it like this
and hold for ten seconds. Do four sets.

729
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:17,041
This is quite a bold position.

730
00:47:17,458 --> 00:47:19,875
A little.

731
00:47:19,958 --> 00:47:25,083
I wouldn't do this
with anyone except my husband.

732
00:47:27,875 --> 00:47:30,666
Actually, you can. We are not a couple.

733
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,333
It'd be nice if you were.
You look cute together.

734
00:47:33,416 --> 00:47:37,083
Please, don't tease.
She's gonna be mad at me.

735
00:47:37,166 --> 00:47:39,666
If you don't get her, let me know.
I have many nieces.

736
00:47:44,541 --> 00:47:47,041
These grannies are encouraging them.

737
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:50,250
You need to get here, now.

738
00:47:52,375 --> 00:47:53,833
It won't go down.

739
00:47:57,458 --> 00:48:00,416
Go down. Go down.

740
00:48:15,958 --> 00:48:16,791
Are you tired?

741
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:19,416
It's quite hot.

742
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:24,000
You really don't have a boyfriend?

743
00:48:25,916 --> 00:48:28,333
Why do you ask?
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

744
00:48:29,416 --> 00:48:32,208
Not only are you good at what you do,

745
00:48:32,750 --> 00:48:34,500
you are also good at guessing.

746
00:48:37,833 --> 00:48:38,791
Lin!

747
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,500
Why are you here?

748
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:46,333
I'm claiming my love back.

749
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:51,916
You little kid.

750
00:48:53,125 --> 00:48:55,000
Do you know who I am?

751
00:48:55,958 --> 00:48:59,541
Everyone, this is my girlfriend-to-be.

752
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:03,583
And this little kid
is someone who is taking her away.

753
00:49:03,666 --> 00:49:05,125
Lin, is that true?

754
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:09,666
He's just a patient.

755
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:12,083
Just a patient.

756
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:13,000
Man.

757
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,166
I think you misunderstood something.

758
00:49:23,833 --> 00:49:24,708
Man.

759
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:32,375
Man.

760
00:49:43,708 --> 00:49:45,291
What the hell is wrong with you?

761
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:48,458
Oh, no!

762
00:49:49,750 --> 00:49:51,875
Man, you're creeping me out.

763
00:49:52,416 --> 00:49:55,083
I think you should go.

764
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,583
Don't talk to me like that!
Here's my rage!

765
00:49:59,875 --> 00:50:00,875
Man,

766
00:50:01,250 --> 00:50:02,708
please go.

767
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,875
I'm asking you.

768
00:50:05,166 --> 00:50:06,416
Well, if you ask,

769
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,625
I must go.

770
00:50:20,458 --> 00:50:22,875
Does she even know you were behind it?

771
00:50:24,916 --> 00:50:26,125
I didn't tell her.

772
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:29,166
-Don't.
-Don't do it again?

773
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:30,250
Don't ever admit it.

774
00:50:37,083 --> 00:50:39,333
Someone wants to buy your building?

775
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:41,291
If Kieng agrees to sell his place too,

776
00:50:41,375 --> 00:50:43,500
they're gonna buy it
for five million each.

777
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,416
-Five million!
-Yes.

778
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:46,875
Is that true?

779
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:49,875
They're really gonna buy it
for five million?

780
00:50:49,958 --> 00:50:51,041
Yeah, is that true?

781
00:50:51,125 --> 00:50:54,250
It's so old. I wonder
if they'll really pay five million for it.

782
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:58,000
If you agree to sell,

783
00:50:58,500 --> 00:51:00,166
I'll call them right away.

784
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:11,166
Excuse me. I think I forgot
my tote bag here the other day.

785
00:51:11,250 --> 00:51:14,583
It's white,

786
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:18,250
and it has a prince and princess decal
on it.

787
00:51:19,666 --> 00:51:21,791
Let's go!

788
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:29,416
Has anybody found it or seen it?

789
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:31,000
I don't think so.

790
00:51:31,083 --> 00:51:33,666
You can contact our officer via Line.

791
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:36,500
It's our official account
for lost and found services.

792
00:51:37,125 --> 00:51:38,208
Thank you.

793
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:47,708
Is this your aunt?

794
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:49,333
What do we do?

795
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:10,833
Hello, I'm Mr. Chat from Super D.

796
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:13,708
I'm an officer at lost and found.

797
00:52:13,791 --> 00:52:16,458
I will use this account to contact you.

798
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:17,708
Okay.

799
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:22,541
Do you have a picture of the item?

800
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:26,791
It's a tote bag.
I'm gonna send you the photo.

801
00:52:28,125 --> 00:52:30,666
What are you doing?

802
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:33,000
Nothing.

803
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:36,125
Asking for details.

804
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,250
It's quite old.

805
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:42,000
Yes, mine is so much better.

806
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:45,583
True. Can't beat yours.

807
00:52:45,666 --> 00:52:48,791
If you talk on the second floor,
everyone on the third floor can hear.

808
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,875
Well, it's an echo.

809
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:53,458
It's not. It's a broken ceiling.

810
00:52:54,791 --> 00:52:56,416
What are you laughing at?

811
00:52:56,500 --> 00:52:59,458
Why is there a garbage room
on the third floor?

812
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:03,750
That's his bedroom.

813
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:05,291
Why are you telling him?

814
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:07,000
You could have spared me.

815
00:53:14,833 --> 00:53:17,000
Are they your ancestors?

816
00:53:17,083 --> 00:53:19,875
Yes, I will tell you their stories.

817
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,541
I know it so well.

818
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:24,750
The guy is his father-in-law.
He owned this building.

819
00:53:24,833 --> 00:53:28,333
The woman is his wife.
The Raad Na recipe was hers.

820
00:53:28,416 --> 00:53:31,208
And this one is Kieng's wife,
his better half.

821
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:35,000
What about these two kids?

822
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:38,583
These two? The boy is Kieng's son.

823
00:53:38,666 --> 00:53:41,583
And the girl
is the grandmother's daughter.

824
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:44,625
She is his aunt, and he is her nephew.

825
00:53:44,875 --> 00:53:49,375
So they are relatives. Makes sense?

826
00:53:49,458 --> 00:53:51,125
Not really.

827
00:53:51,208 --> 00:53:54,333
But there's more to the story.

828
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:56,916
-There's more?
-There's more. Let me tell you.

829
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,833
It occurred 23 years ago.

830
00:53:59,916 --> 00:54:03,458
They were on their way
to get ingredients for Raad Na.

831
00:54:03,541 --> 00:54:08,208
When they were crossing the street,
a sedan came straight at them...

832
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:10,666
-Bam!
-No, it went past them.

833
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:14,458
The three of them hurried into the car.
He started the engine.

834
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:17,958
Drove to the intersection,
and just then...

835
00:54:18,041 --> 00:54:19,791
-A truck!
-No truck.

836
00:54:19,875 --> 00:54:21,583
-A trailer!
-No trailer.

837
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:22,750
-What then?
-Appendix.

838
00:54:22,833 --> 00:54:24,583
His appendix burst.

839
00:54:24,666 --> 00:54:28,458
It hurt so bad,
he stepped on the accelerator.

840
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:31,416
The car hit a bicycle, and they all died.

841
00:54:32,083 --> 00:54:34,500
I should have gone somewhere else today.

842
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:45,083
This is Mr. Chat again from Super D.

843
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:48,041
We're trying our best
to find your missing item.

844
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:51,166
I see. It's okay if you don't find it.

845
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:55,291
No, it's not. I'll try to find it.

846
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:57,416
Thank you.

847
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,291
I need more information.
What was in the bag?

848
00:55:00,375 --> 00:55:02,083
A manga.

849
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:08,000
So is it still five million?

850
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:10,458
If you decide to sell this year.

851
00:55:10,541 --> 00:55:11,750
What about next year?

852
00:55:12,083 --> 00:55:14,333
Next year, the price will go down.

853
00:55:14,416 --> 00:55:17,583
It'll probably be worth four million.

854
00:55:17,666 --> 00:55:20,041
Just one year,
and a price-drop of one million.

855
00:55:20,125 --> 00:55:22,541
-What about two years?
-Then it might be three.

856
00:55:22,625 --> 00:55:24,666
-Only three million?
-Three hundred thousand.

857
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:26,208
That's a major price drop.

858
00:55:26,291 --> 00:55:28,958
Three years and 4.7 million gone.

859
00:55:31,333 --> 00:55:34,208
Well, hey.

860
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:36,083
Hurry up and make a decision.

861
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,416
Excuse me.

862
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:43,500
Which manga?

863
00:55:43,583 --> 00:55:45,416
It's a girly manga.

864
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,708
Silly Girl's Last Love.

865
00:55:59,041 --> 00:56:00,833
I've read that too.

866
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:06,333
So strange.
I've never met a guy who's read it.

867
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:09,500
I like it, especially the ending.

868
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:11,958
When the guy says, "You are not alone."

869
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:14,833
My friend keeps mocking me about it.

870
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:20,625
I have that sticker.

871
00:56:21,708 --> 00:56:22,541
I like cats.

872
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,750
Really? Are you also a cat person?

873
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:29,291
I used to have one growing up,
and then it died.

874
00:56:29,375 --> 00:56:31,291
Now, it's hard for me to keep one.

875
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:33,875
Same for me.

876
00:56:35,666 --> 00:56:37,166
What a coincidence.

877
00:56:53,833 --> 00:56:56,333
It's quite old.

878
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:58,833
Is it still five million?

879
00:56:59,333 --> 00:57:01,416
If you decide to sell this year.

880
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,458
Hurry up and make a decision.

881
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:20,583
Who are you talking to, Lin?

882
00:57:20,958 --> 00:57:22,333
A guy for sure.

883
00:57:27,958 --> 00:57:29,541
I knew it.

884
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:35,208
What?

885
00:57:36,333 --> 00:57:37,958
You're hitting on your own aunt.

886
00:57:39,791 --> 00:57:41,375
I'm not.

887
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,333
You son of a bitch. Ungrateful nephew.

888
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:46,375
Our manager can see those texts, remember?

889
00:57:46,458 --> 00:57:47,875
I did see it.

890
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:53,125
Are you hitting on your own aunt?

891
00:57:53,208 --> 00:57:55,666
No, I'm not. I'm not.

892
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:59,625
What kind of nephew are you?
Having feelings for your own aunt?

893
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:03,250
I don't have any feelings.
I'm doing all this--

894
00:58:05,791 --> 00:58:08,250
Don't tell me the whole story yet.
I'm having fun.

895
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,833
Where is your badge, by the way?

896
00:58:13,958 --> 00:58:15,958
You'll get fined if you don't have it on.

897
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:23,166
Shit!

898
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:26,458
What's up with him?

899
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:33,958
Where are you?

900
00:58:35,625 --> 00:58:38,750
I'm heading back to the apartment.
My friend is stopping by.

901
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:39,958
What's up?

902
00:58:40,041 --> 00:58:41,208
Nothing.

903
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,750
Is that a guy?

904
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:44,375
It's my nephew.

905
00:58:57,125 --> 00:58:59,000
Let me go first. Quick! Over there!

906
00:59:08,041 --> 00:59:09,500
Could you be more gentle?

907
00:59:25,208 --> 00:59:27,375
He could have popped my boobs.

908
00:59:31,166 --> 00:59:32,833
Is there an elevator here, Lin?

909
00:59:33,916 --> 00:59:35,416
Just walk.

910
00:59:36,208 --> 00:59:38,750
I told you so many times. I'm low-class.

911
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:40,416
I don't like going up so high.

912
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,916
Walk.

913
00:59:48,333 --> 00:59:51,500
Is it on the third floor or 300th floor?

914
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:58,291
Come on. We're almost there.

915
01:00:02,666 --> 01:00:03,666
Can't get it in?

916
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:07,708
-Yeah.
-Hurry up.

917
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:21,000
I'm home now. Why did you text me?

918
01:00:22,083 --> 01:00:23,208
What's wrong?

919
01:00:26,125 --> 01:00:28,791
You know, stretching.

920
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:31,916
A little exercise. Nothing to do.

921
01:00:33,083 --> 01:00:35,458
Lin, is this your nephew?

922
01:00:43,083 --> 01:00:44,791
Stretching? Let me help.

923
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,875
All done.

924
01:00:54,541 --> 01:00:58,875
Lin, your nephew looks super yummy.

925
01:00:59,583 --> 01:01:00,958
Wanna adopt him?

926
01:01:01,625 --> 01:01:04,333
You can't take that back.
You know I'm serious.

927
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,041
Anyway,

928
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:11,916
don't you think this Mr. Chat is weird?

929
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,833
Is he supposed to text you like that?

930
01:01:14,375 --> 01:01:15,708
Have you met him?

931
01:01:16,666 --> 01:01:19,041
No, it's an official account.

932
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:20,458
Is he flirting with you?

933
01:01:20,833 --> 01:01:22,083
No.

934
01:01:24,708 --> 01:01:26,000
Let me see.

935
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,666
"What are your likes and dislikes?"

936
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:33,833
"I don't like being alone."

937
01:01:33,916 --> 01:01:35,083
Ugh!

938
01:01:35,625 --> 01:01:37,083
"I totally understand.

939
01:01:37,166 --> 01:01:40,500
I'm from another province too,
and now live alone."

940
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:43,541
"Same here."

941
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:46,500
"You've been alone all this time?"

942
01:01:48,291 --> 01:01:50,125
"Yes."

943
01:01:50,208 --> 01:01:52,375
Yes, my ass.
Aren't you living with your nephew?

944
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,791
Well, he just moved in.

945
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:58,791
-So flirty.
-I didn't flirt.

946
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:03,875
Can a company's admin
talk to a customer like this?

947
01:02:05,083 --> 01:02:08,291
Well, he said the company
wants him to be friendly.

948
01:02:08,375 --> 01:02:12,416
And you believed him?
Don't you think he's a creep?

949
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:15,333
Don't say that.

950
01:02:15,416 --> 01:02:17,916
At least I know where he works.

951
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:21,208
Let me see more.

952
01:02:22,583 --> 01:02:25,125
"What about the things you like?"

953
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:28,416
"I like many things, especially...

954
01:02:29,625 --> 01:02:32,333
food."

955
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:33,916
Enough.

956
01:02:35,666 --> 01:02:37,958
What are you doing?
Reading your lover's texts?

957
01:02:38,375 --> 01:02:41,291
Oh, my God. How did you know?

958
01:02:41,375 --> 01:02:43,083
Look at this.

959
01:02:43,875 --> 01:02:46,833
She hasn't even met him.

960
01:02:49,625 --> 01:02:51,541
So what? It's my business.

961
01:02:53,666 --> 01:02:57,625
Lin, I have to go now. Damn.

962
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:06,000
If I didn't have work,
I would have stayed longer.

963
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:09,791
All right. You can come anytime.

964
01:03:10,541 --> 01:03:12,208
You said it.

965
01:03:12,291 --> 01:03:16,750
Excuse me.

966
01:03:18,041 --> 01:03:19,833
I'm going now.

967
01:03:19,916 --> 01:03:21,708
Can I have a kiss?

968
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:28,208
Next time then.

969
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:31,166
See you.

970
01:03:32,541 --> 01:03:34,583
Take care.

971
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:49,041
Dear nephew.

972
01:03:49,125 --> 01:03:52,291
You can't just walk past me like that.

973
01:03:56,541 --> 01:03:59,875
Uncle Man, I didn't see you there.

974
01:03:59,958 --> 01:04:03,541
What can I do for you?

975
01:04:03,625 --> 01:04:05,208
You don't need to do anything.

976
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:10,375
I'm in the process of not being
in love with Lin. Permanently.

977
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:12,375
What process?

978
01:04:12,458 --> 01:04:16,125
Yesterday, I wanted to delete her
from my Facebook friends list.

979
01:04:16,583 --> 01:04:19,083
Just when I was about to do so,

980
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,291
I saw one of her friends.

981
01:04:21,708 --> 01:04:24,541
She's super cute.
I would like to get to know her.

982
01:04:24,625 --> 01:04:26,708
Look, she sells things online.

983
01:04:29,208 --> 01:04:33,875
So go ahead.
You can buy the stuff she sells.

984
01:04:33,958 --> 01:04:37,375
You don't need to tell me that.

985
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,916
I already did.

986
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,541
Bought these contact lens.

987
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:45,500
You are so fast.

988
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:48,125
I'm going to order 20 bottles of vitamins.

989
01:04:48,208 --> 01:04:51,291
And she will deliver them in person.

990
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:52,875
Here?

991
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:56,458
It can't be here. What if Lin sees her?

992
01:04:56,541 --> 01:04:58,041
She will be heartbroken.

993
01:04:58,708 --> 01:05:00,041
They're friends!

994
01:05:03,583 --> 01:05:05,541
Very thoughtful.

995
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,250
Am I a bad person?

996
01:05:12,583 --> 01:05:16,208
How could that be?

997
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:19,333
All you did was follow your heart.

998
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:23,125
-That's cool.
-You mean it?

999
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:38,875
-Mr. Man?
-Yes.

1000
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:41,541
This is your order.

1001
01:05:41,625 --> 01:05:43,458
Twenty bottles of vitamin C.

1002
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:48,083
Where is Ya?

1003
01:05:48,166 --> 01:05:50,041
I'm Ya.

1004
01:05:54,375 --> 01:05:55,500
Are you kidding me?

1005
01:05:55,583 --> 01:05:57,625
No, I'm not. I'm Ya.

1006
01:05:59,166 --> 01:06:00,000
Shit.

1007
01:06:03,416 --> 01:06:05,916
How come you don't look like your picture?

1008
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,666
It's the natural look today.

1009
01:06:21,416 --> 01:06:23,791
-Can I get my money back?
-What the hell?

1010
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:26,500
Due!

1011
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:30,125
Go check on the seafood sales for me.

1012
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:32,750
Men came up with a weird promotion.

1013
01:06:32,833 --> 01:06:36,708
Buy clams and get free mothballs?
What was he thinking?

1014
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:39,958
Stinky clams. Who is going to buy that?

1015
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,125
Go on. Check on the bakery sales too.

1016
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,041
I'm not returning the money.

1017
01:06:46,125 --> 01:06:49,333
If you don't, I'll tell everyone.

1018
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:51,875
Shouldn't have bought your stuff.

1019
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:52,916
Look at this.

1020
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:58,750
I'm wearing this for you!

1021
01:06:58,833 --> 01:07:00,166
Even though it burns!

1022
01:07:00,250 --> 01:07:03,500
-Why is your face like that?
-What is wrong with my face?

1023
01:07:03,583 --> 01:07:05,625
-It's not like your picture!
-So what?

1024
01:07:05,708 --> 01:07:09,000
You, too, act super rich in your profile.

1025
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:12,708
Look at the real you.
Is that really human hair?

1026
01:07:12,791 --> 01:07:14,541
Shut up, scammer!

1027
01:07:14,625 --> 01:07:17,708
What is going on over here?

1028
01:07:17,791 --> 01:07:19,583
It's getting quite loud.

1029
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:23,708
This guy is a scammer!

1030
01:07:23,791 --> 01:07:26,416
-Bitch, stop talking like that.
-What's going on, Ya?

1031
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:30,916
-Lin!
-Man?

1032
01:07:31,375 --> 01:07:32,375
Auntie Lin!

1033
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,291
Men?

1034
01:07:43,083 --> 01:07:44,333
What are you doing?

1035
01:07:46,208 --> 01:07:47,291
Working.

1036
01:07:48,375 --> 01:07:50,541
I know you are Mr. Chat.

1037
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:02,041
I think you should come down.

1038
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:16,708
It's quite a mess.

1039
01:08:25,833 --> 01:08:26,791
Auntie.

1040
01:08:27,333 --> 01:08:29,666
Auntie, calm down.

1041
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:33,708
Why are you doing this?

1042
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:36,333
Well...

1043
01:08:46,250 --> 01:08:47,666
I told him.

1044
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,166
I don't know why he's doing this.

1045
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:53,625
You don't get it.

1046
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:57,416
-There is more to this story.
-How so?

1047
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:01,000
It's obvious he's hitting on his aunt.

1048
01:09:01,416 --> 01:09:02,833
He's not.

1049
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:06,583
He just doesn't want her
to have a boyfriend.

1050
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:10,125
For him, if she can like
someone she's never met,

1051
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:12,750
that's better than someone else.

1052
01:09:13,041 --> 01:09:15,541
At least the chat guy is not real.

1053
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:18,125
Let's just say
he can't make a move on his aunt,

1054
01:09:18,208 --> 01:09:21,791
so he's doing everything he can
to get in the way. That's it.

1055
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:28,958
Thank you, Lin.
You helped me a lot with my research.

1056
01:09:33,125 --> 01:09:33,958
Lin.

1057
01:09:35,708 --> 01:09:37,541
Is something bothering you?

1058
01:09:38,375 --> 01:09:40,583
Why? It's that obvious?

1059
01:09:42,791 --> 01:09:44,583
You're quite distant.

1060
01:09:46,083 --> 01:09:48,458
But you're still cute.

1061
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:52,875
Excuse me.

1062
01:10:04,208 --> 01:10:05,041
Is that all?

1063
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:09,291
That's all. We ordered four dishes.

1064
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,625
I mean you.

1065
01:10:12,000 --> 01:10:14,541
Besides the food, do you also want me?

1066
01:10:16,541 --> 01:10:17,625
Just like that?

1067
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:21,291
-So cheesy. Right?
-Yes.

1068
01:10:32,250 --> 01:10:34,666
Did you invite him, too?

1069
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:35,875
No.

1070
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,333
How did you find me?

1071
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:44,875
I went to the hospital.
They told me you were here.

1072
01:10:44,958 --> 01:10:46,041
Why are you here?

1073
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:48,625
You're really going to be with him?

1074
01:10:49,833 --> 01:10:51,708
Why are you asking me these things?

1075
01:10:51,791 --> 01:10:53,041
-Well, I'm--
-Quiet.

1076
01:10:53,791 --> 01:10:56,416
Don't be with him.
How do you know if he's a good guy?

1077
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:58,500
I am a good guy.

1078
01:10:58,583 --> 01:11:00,625
What about someone
who lied to his own family?

1079
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:01,958
Is that a good guy?

1080
01:11:02,375 --> 01:11:04,000
-Calm down.
-Shut up!

1081
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:07,750
Just don't be with him.
I don't think he's a good guy.

1082
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:08,958
What?

1083
01:11:09,791 --> 01:11:11,625
Who are you to judge him?

1084
01:11:12,083 --> 01:11:14,833
Would you be okay
if someone messed with your life?

1085
01:11:15,458 --> 01:11:17,875
You shouldn't mess with anyone's life.

1086
01:11:19,750 --> 01:11:23,083
You know, you always upset people.

1087
01:11:24,625 --> 01:11:25,958
What do you want me to do?

1088
01:11:27,083 --> 01:11:30,916
Instead of following me
and getting up to nonsense,

1089
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:33,750
you should go back to school.

1090
01:11:35,875 --> 01:11:39,375
At least, that will help your dad.

1091
01:11:39,791 --> 01:11:41,875
Until you do that,

1092
01:11:43,125 --> 01:11:44,708
I'm not gonna see you anymore.

1093
01:12:13,208 --> 01:12:15,750
Lin, take a seat.

1094
01:12:20,416 --> 01:12:21,333
How are you?

1095
01:12:21,958 --> 01:12:24,166
I met Due.

1096
01:12:25,500 --> 01:12:28,958
He hasn't finished college,
and he's too afraid to tell you.

1097
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:32,666
He's working part-time at a supermarket.

1098
01:12:36,750 --> 01:12:38,958
One more thing.

1099
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:42,583
Someone wants to buy this building.

1100
01:12:42,666 --> 01:12:45,791
Really? Are you gonna sell it?

1101
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:48,333
That's okay with me.

1102
01:12:48,916 --> 01:12:52,416
Because I don't think Due is gonna
come back and do something here.

1103
01:12:53,666 --> 01:12:56,750
I'd like your opinion.

1104
01:12:57,666 --> 01:12:59,958
Why?

1105
01:13:00,416 --> 01:13:04,041
This is yours. It's for you to decide.

1106
01:13:09,125 --> 01:13:09,958
Professor.

1107
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:13,666
We'd like to come back to college.

1108
01:13:14,125 --> 01:13:17,000
Well, it's about time
you came to your senses.

1109
01:13:17,666 --> 01:13:18,583
And...

1110
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:22,750
is there a try-out for college?

1111
01:13:22,833 --> 01:13:25,333
-Yes. You want in?
-Yes.

1112
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:27,333
It's full.

1113
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:30,916
Only one left. Hurdles.

1114
01:13:36,583 --> 01:13:37,416
Okay.

1115
01:13:39,125 --> 01:13:40,208
Sign here.

1116
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:45,833
Is Game in, too?

1117
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:48,333
Are you scared of him or something?

1118
01:14:01,083 --> 01:14:01,916
Auntie.

1119
01:14:03,041 --> 01:14:07,625
If I'm gonna sell this place,
I need to tell the kids the truth.

1120
01:14:08,208 --> 01:14:09,583
What should I do?

1121
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:14,583
What would you do?

1122
01:14:25,833 --> 01:14:27,041
It's you!

1123
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:33,750
Here we are again.

1124
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:37,541
We'll see.

1125
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:42,250
I'm not gonna lose to you forever.

1126
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:46,708
We'll see.

1127
01:14:46,791 --> 01:14:49,083
I won't make it easy for you.

1128
01:14:49,708 --> 01:14:50,833
I'm on A team.

1129
01:14:50,916 --> 01:14:53,083
You need to pass from B team
to compete with me.

1130
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:54,500
I'll wait for you.

1131
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:05,333
We're back again at the college try-out.

1132
01:15:05,416 --> 01:15:06,833
Ready.

1133
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:09,416
Five of them are all set.

1134
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:10,375
A TEAM

1135
01:15:10,458 --> 01:15:12,458
Keep your eyes on them.

1136
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:15,666
Don't take your eyes off Game.

1137
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:16,708
B TEAM

1138
01:15:16,791 --> 01:15:18,333
Believe it or not,

1139
01:15:18,416 --> 01:15:22,000
we have Mr. Due, the Speed.

1140
01:15:22,083 --> 01:15:26,750
Always brings bad luck
and keeps disappointing a fan like me.

1141
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:30,875
He's in B team, that means
he needs to be in the top three.

1142
01:15:30,958 --> 01:15:33,458
Waiting for the signal.

1143
01:15:34,333 --> 01:15:35,166
Set.

1144
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:39,166
A TEAM

1145
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:42,083
Here we go!
It's so fast, I can't catch up.

1146
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,958
Look at their legs go. Here we go.

1147
01:15:47,958 --> 01:15:48,875
B TEAM

1148
01:15:48,958 --> 01:15:51,208
All right, it has begun.
Very beautiful start.

1149
01:15:51,291 --> 01:15:52,708
Don't look anywhere.

1150
01:15:54,083 --> 01:15:56,208
Game already jumped two hurdles.

1151
01:15:56,291 --> 01:15:58,000
He's moving up from fourth to second.

1152
01:15:58,083 --> 01:16:01,625
Here he comes.
His legs are working super hard.

1153
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:04,875
There he goes.

1154
01:16:06,458 --> 01:16:09,291
Game won first place for A team.

1155
01:16:09,375 --> 01:16:11,666
Can Due make it to the top three?

1156
01:16:11,750 --> 01:16:13,333
Can he do it?

1157
01:16:13,416 --> 01:16:17,000
Oh, my! He made it into the top three.

1158
01:16:17,083 --> 01:16:19,666
An announcement
for the buffalo racing event in Chonburi.

1159
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:23,166
It takes place every year
on October 18th at Ban Bung.

1160
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:25,666
My honored guests,
before we begin another race,

1161
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:29,333
let me thank all our sponsors.

1162
01:16:29,416 --> 01:16:31,375
Suriyan Coffin, everyone.

1163
01:16:31,458 --> 01:16:34,916
"Your suffering is our joy. Buy one
for the parent, get one free for the kid.

1164
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:38,541
If you're sick and in the hospital,
kindly prepare yourself."

1165
01:16:38,625 --> 01:16:41,291
They also provide
decorative lighting and a joss-stick pot.

1166
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:42,958
The next shop is Porn's Kites.

1167
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:46,208
They've got all kinds of kites,
BDSM, bondage...

1168
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:50,125
Quality kites that fulfill
all your desires.

1169
01:16:50,666 --> 01:16:51,833
You have to win.

1170
01:16:53,416 --> 01:16:55,041
Due.

1171
01:16:55,625 --> 01:16:57,166
Someone's here to see you.

1172
01:17:03,416 --> 01:17:04,291
Dad.

1173
01:17:05,041 --> 01:17:07,083
Do you have a minute to talk?

1174
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,416
I have you something.

1175
01:17:12,041 --> 01:17:15,875
Your mom and I
were just grandma's employees.

1176
01:17:17,583 --> 01:17:18,458
What?

1177
01:17:20,875 --> 01:17:24,125
Lin is their daughter.

1178
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:28,458
We were just their employees.

1179
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:32,791
But she loved us so much.

1180
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:36,875
After she passed,

1181
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:39,500
I made a promise to myself.

1182
01:17:40,041 --> 01:17:43,541
I would take care of Lin as family.

1183
01:17:44,208 --> 01:17:46,833
Just like they took care of us.

1184
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:51,000
I've been keeping
this secret for a long time.

1185
01:17:52,666 --> 01:17:54,375
Why are you telling me now?

1186
01:17:54,958 --> 01:17:59,458
Because you're not
coming back to live there.

1187
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:03,166
I'm gonna sell the building.

1188
01:18:04,500 --> 01:18:06,291
Part of the money will be Lin's.

1189
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:11,791
I don't have a plan B for you anymore.

1190
01:18:13,500 --> 01:18:15,583
You need to take care of yourself.

1191
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:19,250
You mean...

1192
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,083
Lin and I are not related?

1193
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,833
Ready.

1194
01:18:34,125 --> 01:18:37,166
All right.
We're back with another hurdle race.

1195
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:42,666
Let's see if Due
can make an awesome comeback.

1196
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:50,375
Set.

1197
01:18:58,083 --> 01:19:01,208
They're very close now, everyone!

1198
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:03,958
Game's cleared the first hurdle.

1199
01:19:04,833 --> 01:19:05,750
Second.

1200
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:08,041
Due is close. Game is ahead.

1201
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:10,166
Third one.

1202
01:19:10,583 --> 01:19:14,041
Can he catch up? Can he?

1203
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,500
He's back. Due!

1204
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:51,916
Where the hell is he going?

1205
01:19:53,458 --> 01:19:54,708
Where are you going?

1206
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:55,791
Leave me alone.

1207
01:19:56,291 --> 01:19:57,666
I have to tell you something.

1208
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,708
-I don't wanna hear it.
-You must know this.

1209
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:01,125
I don't wanna hear it!

1210
01:20:01,625 --> 01:20:03,083
We're not related!

1211
01:20:13,625 --> 01:20:14,666
What?

1212
01:20:16,541 --> 01:20:17,458
Look...

1213
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:21,250
My mom and dad...

1214
01:20:24,083 --> 01:20:25,875
were just your parents' employees.

1215
01:20:27,833 --> 01:20:28,708
Is that true?

1216
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:31,833
Are you teasing me again?

1217
01:20:31,916 --> 01:20:33,958
There's nothing to tease about.

1218
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:37,750
My dad just told me.

1219
01:20:40,083 --> 01:20:41,000
Lin.

1220
01:20:42,750 --> 01:20:44,541
We are not related.

1221
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,166
What the hell?

1222
01:20:50,458 --> 01:20:51,291
Lin.

1223
01:20:52,583 --> 01:20:53,458
I'm sorry.

1224
01:21:04,666 --> 01:21:06,208
All this time...

1225
01:21:09,708 --> 01:21:11,791
You can be stubborn, terrible...

1226
01:21:11,875 --> 01:21:14,958
You can tease me however you want.
I don't mind.

1227
01:21:15,500 --> 01:21:17,333
But now you're telling me this.

1228
01:21:18,708 --> 01:21:20,250
That we're not related?

1229
01:21:23,666 --> 01:21:26,541
That means I have
no one else left in this world.

1230
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:36,958
At least I had you as a nephew...

1231
01:21:39,666 --> 01:21:41,583
I had him as my brother-in-law.

1232
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:46,250
I had a family.

1233
01:21:48,916 --> 01:21:50,541
And now you're saying...

1234
01:21:51,750 --> 01:21:53,458
we're not family.

1235
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:57,250
How is that supposed to make me happy?

1236
01:21:58,125 --> 01:22:00,291
-Lin...
-You're so cruel.

1237
01:22:03,541 --> 01:22:04,833
Do you even know?

1238
01:22:05,916 --> 01:22:07,750
Sometimes I feel lonely, but at least...

1239
01:22:10,208 --> 01:22:11,916
I know

1240
01:22:12,958 --> 01:22:15,458
I have a family waiting at home.

1241
01:22:18,125 --> 01:22:19,250
But now...

1242
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:21,166
you're telling me

1243
01:22:22,291 --> 01:22:24,041
that I never had a family at all.

1244
01:22:28,666 --> 01:22:29,500
Lin...

1245
01:22:42,208 --> 01:22:44,333
Is this what you were afraid of?

1246
01:23:05,583 --> 01:23:08,416
The scholarship in England,
is it still available?

1247
01:23:08,791 --> 01:23:11,833
It's very close to the deadline now.

1248
01:23:11,916 --> 01:23:15,333
There was one space left last week,
but I'm not sure

1249
01:23:15,416 --> 01:23:17,875
if they've finished the selection.

1250
01:23:18,416 --> 01:23:19,333
Do you want to go?

1251
01:23:19,416 --> 01:23:21,333
Yes, is it still possible?

1252
01:23:22,333 --> 01:23:24,458
I'll see to it.

1253
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:28,083
They only accept people
younger than 30. Do you know that?

1254
01:23:28,166 --> 01:23:30,416
Yes, I do.

1255
01:23:30,500 --> 01:23:31,833
I'm not over 30.

1256
01:23:32,375 --> 01:23:35,666
Lin, that's right!

1257
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:40,583
You're two days away
from turning 25. I remember.

1258
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:44,375
Wait. You're younger than your nephew?

1259
01:23:44,458 --> 01:23:45,583
Ann!

1260
01:23:47,166 --> 01:23:48,000
I'm sorry.

1261
01:23:48,541 --> 01:23:49,625
It's okay.

1262
01:23:50,083 --> 01:23:51,833
I'll leave it to you then, Doctor.

1263
01:23:51,916 --> 01:23:52,958
All right.

1264
01:23:54,083 --> 01:23:55,916
I'm going to see patients, then.

1265
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:03,750
Where have you been for so many days?

1266
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:06,250
I went to Khon Kaen for merit-making.

1267
01:24:06,916 --> 01:24:08,500
I see.

1268
01:24:08,958 --> 01:24:14,250
If you're interested,
Jum can take you to do that in Isan.

1269
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:19,375
She's invited us so many times,
but we just can't.

1270
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:22,375
Her itinerary is so packed.

1271
01:24:22,458 --> 01:24:25,041
Do you know where she took us?

1272
01:24:25,416 --> 01:24:27,875
We went to pay our respects
to Lady Mo in Korat.

1273
01:24:27,958 --> 01:24:31,500
The relics at Nakhon Phanom.

1274
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:36,833
Praya Tao Ngoi at Sakon Nakhon.
Then we circled around.

1275
01:24:37,041 --> 01:24:41,791
Kham Chanot at Udon Thani.
Then we paid our respects at Phra See.

1276
01:24:41,875 --> 01:24:42,708
Phra Sai!

1277
01:24:43,041 --> 01:24:44,875
Phor Phra Sai at Nong Khai.

1278
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:49,458
If that were not enough, we also went
to see the sand chedi at Roi Et.

1279
01:24:49,541 --> 01:24:53,166
I don't even know why you're a nurse.

1280
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:56,750
You could just work
for the Thai Tourism Department!

1281
01:25:00,583 --> 01:25:01,666
Why are they smiling?

1282
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:09,000
Don't tell me that you and Jum...

1283
01:25:17,166 --> 01:25:18,458
Is it gonna work?

1284
01:25:18,875 --> 01:25:20,583
Of course.

1285
01:25:22,291 --> 01:25:25,000
Quick, your aunt is here.

1286
01:25:25,083 --> 01:25:26,916
Due, try to look nice.

1287
01:25:27,625 --> 01:25:28,750
She's here.

1288
01:25:30,583 --> 01:25:32,291
What the hell? Light the candles.

1289
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:34,416
Are you waiting for them
to light themselves?

1290
01:25:37,208 --> 01:25:38,541
Can you look better?

1291
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,708
When she gets here, just go in.

1292
01:25:44,750 --> 01:25:46,333
She's coming. Ready.

1293
01:25:49,833 --> 01:25:51,250
It's hot today.

1294
01:25:52,208 --> 01:25:53,166
Hot?

1295
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:56,666
Is it going to rain?

1296
01:25:56,750 --> 01:25:58,375
-Yeah?
-Shit!

1297
01:25:58,458 --> 01:25:59,500
Fire!

1298
01:26:01,041 --> 01:26:02,083
Help me!

1299
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:10,666
The doll!

1300
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:12,375
You dumbass, come help me first!

1301
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:17,333
Water!

1302
01:26:18,666 --> 01:26:20,000
Shit!

1303
01:26:22,833 --> 01:26:25,291
I've got water!

1304
01:26:28,458 --> 01:26:29,458
Water's here!

1305
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:34,416
Son of a bitch.

1306
01:26:35,125 --> 01:26:36,333
The fire was out already.

1307
01:26:51,166 --> 01:26:53,375
Happy Birthday. I wish you the best and--

1308
01:27:12,625 --> 01:27:15,166
Okay. You take care.

1309
01:27:18,541 --> 01:27:21,833
Lin. I'm sorry.

1310
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:24,416
It's okay, brother.

1311
01:27:25,750 --> 01:27:27,125
Safe travels.

1312
01:27:27,583 --> 01:27:30,541
Call me sometimes.

1313
01:27:40,666 --> 01:27:43,625
Ya, Lin is leaving soon.

1314
01:27:43,708 --> 01:27:45,750
We're going to miss her so bad.

1315
01:27:46,666 --> 01:27:47,833
Sure.

1316
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:52,750
What are they looking at?

1317
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:04,500
Oh, my God!

1318
01:28:12,625 --> 01:28:16,041
I didn't know you come here.

1319
01:28:16,875 --> 01:28:19,500
Not dressed like a rocker today?

1320
01:28:19,583 --> 01:28:20,625
You scammer!

1321
01:28:20,708 --> 01:28:22,208
You and your ugly face!

1322
01:28:22,291 --> 01:28:24,458
So what? Got my feet stuck in your mouth?

1323
01:28:24,541 --> 01:28:26,041
You want some of this?

1324
01:28:26,916 --> 01:28:28,541
Ya! Be quiet!

1325
01:28:30,375 --> 01:28:33,041
Man, I'm asking you--

1326
01:28:33,125 --> 01:28:35,291
I think you should mind your own business.

1327
01:28:43,083 --> 01:28:45,166
Why is he dancing over here?

1328
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:47,583
Shut up. You don't even know how to dance.

1329
01:28:47,958 --> 01:28:49,791
This is only for real dancers.

1330
01:28:52,291 --> 01:28:53,583
Move.

1331
01:28:56,666 --> 01:29:00,166
Do you want a dance-off?

1332
01:29:00,250 --> 01:29:01,458
Bring it on.

1333
01:29:13,083 --> 01:29:14,291
Nice butt.

1334
01:29:16,416 --> 01:29:19,291
Man, are you okay?

1335
01:29:19,375 --> 01:29:20,375
Bitch! You kicked me.

1336
01:29:20,458 --> 01:29:22,041
How do you know that?

1337
01:29:23,583 --> 01:29:25,000
Ya!

1338
01:29:25,916 --> 01:29:27,083
LIN, I VALUE YOU THE MOST
FOR ALWAYS BEING BY MY SIDE.

1339
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:28,208
I MISSED YOU THE MOST.
NEVER MEANT TO ANGER YOU.

1340
01:29:28,833 --> 01:29:31,375
I'm sorry. Do you really
need to memorize this?

1341
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:34,791
I'm sorry. Do you need to memorize this?
Shouldn't it come from the heart?

1342
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:37,166
Stop talking. This comes from my heart.

1343
01:29:37,250 --> 01:29:39,958
But it's a lot. I can't remember all,
so I have to memorize.

1344
01:29:46,083 --> 01:29:47,125
Hi, Dad.

1345
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:50,791
Due, did you know Lin is leaving?

1346
01:29:50,875 --> 01:29:54,083
What? And no one told me?

1347
01:29:54,166 --> 01:29:56,125
Which flight? Which airport?

1348
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:57,791
Due!

1349
01:30:04,375 --> 01:30:06,041
-This one.
-Which one? This one?

1350
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:13,375
You're the only one
with an accent around here.

1351
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:16,000
Is it ever going to go away? Country boy.

1352
01:30:16,083 --> 01:30:17,625
Well, then you're a country girl.

1353
01:30:20,375 --> 01:30:21,458
What are you doing?

1354
01:30:56,791 --> 01:30:57,625
Lin!

1355
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:01,166
Why didn't you tell me you were leaving?

1356
01:31:04,916 --> 01:31:06,250
Can we talk?

1357
01:31:08,916 --> 01:31:09,916
Lin.

1358
01:31:11,125 --> 01:31:11,958
You know,

1359
01:31:12,958 --> 01:31:15,708
I value you the most.

1360
01:31:18,333 --> 01:31:20,291
For 18 years, from then to now.

1361
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:22,416
When I was away for seven years...

1362
01:31:25,291 --> 01:31:27,000
I missed you the most.

1363
01:31:30,333 --> 01:31:32,375
I never meant to anger you.

1364
01:31:33,500 --> 01:31:35,500
I'm sorry.

1365
01:31:37,666 --> 01:31:39,083
I was wrong.

1366
01:31:41,375 --> 01:31:42,375
Can you forgive me?

1367
01:31:52,708 --> 01:31:54,875
-Let's go back.
-What's the matter with you?

1368
01:31:56,333 --> 01:31:58,625
We're good now.

1369
01:31:59,791 --> 01:32:01,416
We should go home.

1370
01:32:02,458 --> 01:32:05,250
How can I go home? Are you crazy?

1371
01:32:05,791 --> 01:32:09,375
Did you really think you'd say sorry
and things would be the way you want?

1372
01:32:12,375 --> 01:32:13,875
What am I to you?

1373
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:17,416
I said sorry.

1374
01:32:18,958 --> 01:32:20,541
Why are you still mad?

1375
01:32:22,416 --> 01:32:23,833
I'm doing everything I can.

1376
01:32:25,875 --> 01:32:27,333
Can't you understand that?

1377
01:32:27,416 --> 01:32:30,250
I'm not the one who decides
if we are relatives or not.

1378
01:32:32,625 --> 01:32:34,416
You're not doing anything wrong.

1379
01:32:35,666 --> 01:32:37,125
We just feel different things.

1380
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:40,083
I'm sad...

1381
01:32:42,500 --> 01:32:44,041
but you're happy.

1382
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:47,208
How can you be happy?

1383
01:32:53,416 --> 01:32:54,666
Because I like you!

1384
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,791
I've always liked you.

1385
01:33:09,041 --> 01:33:10,666
Isn't that disgusting?

1386
01:33:11,791 --> 01:33:13,458
Because I felt this way...

1387
01:33:14,666 --> 01:33:16,416
I was disgusted with myself.

1388
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:22,875
How can I have feelings
for someone who is family?

1389
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,375
Why does...

1390
01:33:26,833 --> 01:33:31,791
being with you make me so happy?

1391
01:33:35,166 --> 01:33:38,458
I never wanted to acknowledge it
because I knew it was impossible.

1392
01:33:41,083 --> 01:33:42,875
But it's not now.

1393
01:33:42,958 --> 01:33:44,333
Now I can like you.

1394
01:33:44,416 --> 01:33:46,541
I don't have to feel
like I'm weird anymore.

1395
01:33:46,625 --> 01:33:48,500
I don't have to be confused anymore.

1396
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:51,666
I just hope that maybe...

1397
01:33:52,958 --> 01:33:55,166
you feel like that too.

1398
01:33:57,625 --> 01:34:01,791
After all this,
and all you can think about is yourself.

1399
01:34:05,416 --> 01:34:07,000
Okay, Lin.

1400
01:34:07,083 --> 01:34:09,333
Okay.

1401
01:34:09,416 --> 01:34:10,916
We don't have to go that way.

1402
01:34:11,458 --> 01:34:14,208
How do you want us to be? Tell me.

1403
01:34:15,083 --> 01:34:18,083
We can be siblings, friends, anything.

1404
01:34:18,166 --> 01:34:20,250
Or you want to be
aunt and nephew like before.

1405
01:34:20,333 --> 01:34:21,750
We can be like that too.

1406
01:34:22,416 --> 01:34:26,291
From now on,
you can be with whoever you want.

1407
01:34:26,375 --> 01:34:30,208
I will not bother you.
I will fully support you.

1408
01:34:30,541 --> 01:34:31,583
Okay?

1409
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:33,958
I'm asking you for just one thing.

1410
01:34:35,458 --> 01:34:36,875
Please don't leave.

1411
01:34:38,041 --> 01:34:38,875
Please.

1412
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:50,750
That's the last time I talked to him.

1413
01:34:52,625 --> 01:34:56,958
I decided to leave.
I really had to be alone this time.

1414
01:34:58,333 --> 01:35:00,500
At least, being alone

1415
01:35:00,583 --> 01:35:04,166
gives us time to review
the things that happened.

1416
01:35:05,041 --> 01:35:09,833
In reality, meeting someone is not as easy
as the manga makes it out to be.

1417
01:35:10,333 --> 01:35:14,708
Sometimes, the person we like
doesn't feel the same.

1418
01:35:17,041 --> 01:35:20,500
Sometimes, the person who likes us,
and we think he's cute, too,

1419
01:35:20,583 --> 01:35:24,541
we still have to part ways
because of something else.

1420
01:35:27,375 --> 01:35:29,750
Sometimes, no matter
how hard someone tries,

1421
01:35:29,833 --> 01:35:32,166
we could never like him back,

1422
01:35:32,250 --> 01:35:35,208
even though he would go
as far as changing himself.

1423
01:35:36,041 --> 01:35:37,833
Ann told me that having someone,

1424
01:35:37,916 --> 01:35:42,416
maybe we don't have
to think about that at all.

1425
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,708
Just let life happen.

1426
01:35:46,708 --> 01:35:48,416
For me, right now,

1427
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:52,791
I know that having someone
is not as important.

1428
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:56,250
It's family that matters.

1429
01:35:57,208 --> 01:36:00,083
I think Due might feel the same.

1430
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:08,791
Thank you.

1431
01:36:08,875 --> 01:36:11,875
NGOR POCHANA
MENU

1432
01:36:20,750 --> 01:36:22,166
Can I order Raad Na, please?

1433
01:36:49,208 --> 01:36:50,791
Just like he said,

1434
01:36:52,166 --> 01:36:53,333
you're not alone.

1435
01:37:11,458 --> 01:37:14,791
Without Kieng and you over there,

1436
01:37:15,416 --> 01:37:16,916
I was super lonely.

1437
01:37:21,791 --> 01:37:23,291
I missed you so much.

1438
01:37:35,041 --> 01:37:36,333
I missed you too.

1439
01:37:43,125 --> 01:37:45,583
I didn't know you could act your age.

1440
01:38:04,583 --> 01:38:05,708
I'm going now.

1441
01:38:07,458 --> 01:38:08,458
Okay.

1442
01:38:18,958 --> 01:38:20,500
Can I ask you something?

1443
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:24,791
Yes?

1444
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:27,000
Do you have a boyfriend?

1445
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:33,083
Why don't you ask me?

1446
01:38:33,541 --> 01:38:34,750
No need to text.

1447
01:38:48,708 --> 01:38:50,750
Have you found someone you like?

1448
01:41:05,791 --> 01:41:07,791
