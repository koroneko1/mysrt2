00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.130
So, what's the plan? Tell me.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:08.020
Well...

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:10.420
I haven't thought about it.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:12.280
What? Dude!

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.600
You already accepted the challenge from X that you will hit on Mook for 21 Days.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.180
Aren't you going to come up with some plans?

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.980
All I have to do is to make her ask me to the Awards Ceremony.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.280
That's it.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.220
I see. So, you're just going to walk up to her and be like.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.260
"Mook, can you please ask me to go to the Awards Ceremony with you?"

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.420
If you're going to do that, I think you better tell X that you give up.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.460
That would be less embarrassing than walking straight to Mook and begging her stupidly.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.240
Then what do you think I should do?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.860
You're asking the right person.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.400
You have Frank and me as the mastermind behind this mission. I guarantee you...

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.220
We will fail!

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.380
How about this?

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.820
You should follow her on Instagram first

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.840
because her phone number and contacts are usually there.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.840
Also, you'll know what she's up to these days.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.200
You're right! Good job, man.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.260
But...

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.330
Hm?

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.530
I don't have Instagram.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.950
But that's okay!

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.970
I can use my mom's bakery shop account.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.240
Good!

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.820
Are you dumb?

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.840
Hit him one more time for me.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.800
How can she know who you are if you use your mom's account?

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.510
Give me your phone.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.260
I'll create an Instagram account for you.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:38.880
You slapped me too hard.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.020
Now,

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.580
you gotta make her know that you're interested in her.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.220
And you have to make her interested in you too.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.620
By following her on Instagram?

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.370
Yep.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.840
Million people are following her.

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.020
How do I get her to notice me?

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.330
I think you should start by liking her pictures.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.110
Start from a picture she posted one year ago.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:04.480
- Yeah.
- Shit.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.420
Your name will pop up in her notification. She will notice you for sure.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.580
Here you go.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.400
Now, we have to find out what she likes and dislikes.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.280
So we can plan our next step.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.840
(Day 1)

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.440
Thank you.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.520
Auntie, what did she just order?

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.020
Chicken rice without skin.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.350
Chicken... rice...

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.180
This one is so good. Trust me.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.310
Here you go.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.510
Q!

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.170
You gotta beat him.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.860
I can accept it if that person is you.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.280
Accept what?

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.600
Frank, give that to me!

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.950
Mook's desk is the second one in the second row...

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.350
What the hell is wrong with him?

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.350
He brought binoculars to school?

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.040
Mook!

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.930
- Milk tea for you!
- Soft drink for you!

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.330
Do you want butterfly pea tea lemonade?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.660
I think I'll have bubble milk tea.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.500
She likes to drink bubble milk tea.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.660
Alright, let's call it a day.

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.570
Q.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.600
Don't forget to put your mom's pastries under Mook's desk.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.970
Don't forget. Her desk is the second one in the second row.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.700
Where are you going?

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.600
I'm going to find more information for you.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.400
She's over there.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.040
Bye-bye.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.200
What the hell?

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.020
I also have to go. I have an extra class today. See you later!

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.130
Frank!

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.310
They all ditched me. Such good friends!

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.770
You just got dumped.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.340
Whoa. Why are you so surprised?

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:19.130
You just sneaked up on me like that. How lucky you are that I didn't punch you?

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.350
You're going to punch me?

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.600
Actually, we are no longer strangers.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.170
You can talk to me nicely.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.620
Since I met you, nothing good is happening to me.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.420
It will be better if we see each other less often.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.730
What is it?

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.370
Why are you giving this to me?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.640
It's for your mom, not you.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.170
You cooked dinner for me yesterday.

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:54.370
She also gave me a lot of snacks.

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.080
So I want to repay her kindness.

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.710
If you want to suck up to her, why don't you give it to her yourself?

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.640
I was going to do that.

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.730
But I'm worried someone around here might be mad at me.

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.440
Also, I have to go to Rookie for costume fitting and still photo shooting.

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.510
So, I think it's better to give it to you.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.570
Just take it.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:21.550
I've got to go.

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:26.130
Hey! Wait!

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.130
They've confirmed you already?

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.150
Damn it. I didn't get the part again.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.180
Are you looking for a place to exercise?

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:11.060
You're so lucky. We currently have a special promotion.

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.220
Er... I'm not...

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.860
You seem to be interested in a healthy lifestyle.

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:17.040
What's your name?

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.770
Me? I...

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.240
My name is Toy.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.400
Oh, Toy.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:28.240
A body like you, if you build more muscle, you will look good like 'oppa.' I'm sure you will attract all the girls.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:31.800
Well, today... I just...

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:36.350
I just want to look around. I will...

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.420
Don't worry. If you sign up for a 6-month membership, I'll give you an extra one-year membership for free.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.370
Or you can try for three months first. If it's not convenient for you, we also have weekly membership.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.930
We offer an installment payment as well.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:48.820
I'll get you a registration form.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.130
Oh, it's okay! I gotta go--

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:05.640
I guess I have to try it out.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.180
Did you do the homework I gave you last week?

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.020
It's all done.

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:12.820
Good job. Let me have a look.

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.350
See?

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:22.750
Well then, can you explain how you calculate this question?

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.640
Of course. Well, the "N"-- Oh!

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.530
Hey!

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.770
I'm sorry!

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.440
I'll clean it for you.

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:34.480
Stop. Stop right there.

00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.280
It gets messier now. I'll clean it myself.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.710
You should tell the staff to clean this.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.220
I'm so sorry.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:42.780
Whatever.

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.550
Oh my! It's beautiful.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.170
Tell him thank you for this.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:20.510
It must be nice if my son is half as good as him.

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:26.710
What a great boy he is! He's smart. He's cute. He's well-mannered.

00:08:27.310 --> 00:08:29.550
He's reliable. He's kind.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:30.310
Gosh!

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.110
That's enough, Mom.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.220
Why don't you just trade me for him?

00:08:34.730 --> 00:08:36.400
That would be great!

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.930
But I'm worried that if we do that, you will cause X's parents headache.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:44.950
By the way, why are you home so early? Don't you have basketball practice today?

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.800
Other families want their children to come back home early.

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:50.080
Look at you.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.510
When you come back home, all you do is play games instead of helping me.

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.860
You should learn how to bake.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.200
Men who can cook are attractive.

00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:12.620
Who's calling? Can you answer the phone for me?

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.000
Hello, this is Mommy's Bakery.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:24.110
I'm home!

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.220
Why are you calling me?

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.970
Who's calling?

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.710
Is that a customer? Talk to him nicely!

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:36.170
Your new beloved son. He wants to talk to you.

00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:38.260
You can thank him yourself.

00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.200
I'm going to take a shower.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:44.440
X, is that you?

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.170
I got it.

00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:50.710
I really like it. Thank you, son.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:56.200
Let me know if you want to come for dinner.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.260
Tell me what you want to eat. I'll make it for you.

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.080
Or you can tell Q.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:03.770
Alright.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:24.700
"If you want to eat anything, you can tell Q."

00:10:26.150 --> 00:10:27.400
You're a troublesome person!

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:39.130
(Keep working on it. Because if you lose, I will ask you to...)

00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:46.530
Who said I'm going to lose to you?

00:11:08.370 --> 00:11:09.660
I'm so sorry.

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:17.550
It's okay. I know you didn't mean to do it.

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.170
Well... I...

00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:21.910
Hey! What are you doing?

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.220
You make my blood boil!

00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:29.800
You were handsy with my girlfriend, and now you dare to step on my freaking foot.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.820
Shit!

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:37.260
You dare swear at me like that?

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.140
- You wanna mess with me, huh?
- No, sir.

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:44.150
You want to show off in front of a girl by slapping him, huh?

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:48.970
Let's not get into a fight. I'm so sorry.

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.980
It's just a misunderstanding. Let's just forget about it.

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:56.930
Don't take this kid too seriously. Let's go.

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:02.280
Are you okay?

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:04.730
You dare to ask me that?

00:12:05.370 --> 00:12:07.820
If you want to start a fight, you have to know how to fight first.

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.950
What kind of girl would be interested in a weakling like you?

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.620
You were so cool just now.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:20.220
That man came in like a tiger but left like a dog.

00:12:21.310 --> 00:12:23.110
I didn't know you practiced boxing.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.700
It's just a basic knowledge of anatomy.

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:31.860
It's not something new for a medical student to know the weak spots on the human body.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.930
Let's not get off topic. Go back to work on your calculation.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.860
I haven't finished cleaning it.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:43.710
Why don't you ask the staff to do it?

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.550
Okay...

00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:02.770
X, I think this outfit doesn't look good on you. Let's try on something else.

00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:04.240
Oh, okay.

00:13:04.370 --> 00:13:05.800
But could you please wait for a second?

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.640
Of course.

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:14.400
(Keep working on it. Because if you lose, I will ask you to...)

00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:22.930
Which one do you want me to wear?

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:23.770
This one.

00:13:24.130 --> 00:13:25.000
Sure.

00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.750
Change it and come back here.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.460
Q! What are you doing? Come down and eat!

00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:34.170
Okay!

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:38.600
(Day 2)

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.400
Hey! Q! Come here.

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:47.170
Come here! Quick!

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:50.800
Come on.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.380
Why did you tell me to come here so early in the morning?

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:59.640
I dropped my grandma off at her Tai Chi class and came right here to help you.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.640
What is it?

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.240
We're here to give her snacks. Put it under her desk!

00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:08.780
The second desk in the second row.

00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:11.970
Where are the snacks?

00:14:11.970 --> 00:14:13.580
Snacks, my ass!

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:15.600
You forgot it, right?

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:22.440
Shit. What should I do?

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:25.910
Never mind. I've prepared it for you.

00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:29.880
After she went to the gym, she went to buy egg tarts.

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.550
But it ran out.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.730
So I had to wait for the new one.

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:34.370
Take it.

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:38.880
Why do you give this to me?

00:14:41.310 --> 00:14:42.130
Put it under her desk!

00:14:42.380 --> 00:14:45.620
So, Toy gave you the egg tarts so you can give it to Mook.

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:48.200
Does she even know that it's you who give her that?

00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.480
If I tell her, how can you call that a surprise?

00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.280
Being mysterious will make her interested in me.

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:03.280
Don't be so full of yourself. Many people give her gifts every day.

00:15:05.660 --> 00:15:09.530
We haven't considered what she will get from all those sponsors and product reviews.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:13.640
You have less than twenty days left. So, what's the point of being so mysterious?

00:15:16.910 --> 00:15:18.200
You've suddenly become an expert.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:20.220
I'm just analyzing the situation.

00:15:20.530 --> 00:15:22.970
Did you like her pictures yet?

00:15:23.540 --> 00:15:26.040
I did that already.

00:15:26.710 --> 00:15:29.310
What kind of person posts that many pictures?

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:33.420
I just started to like the pictures she posted two months ago, but my fingers began to lock up and cramp.

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:38.910
Q, I told you to start liking the pictures she posted one year ago.

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.660
You have no patience at all.

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.970
You should send her a direct message,

00:15:46.530 --> 00:15:48.660
telling her that you bought her favorite pastry.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.910
You should let her know you as fast as you can.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:52.950
So you two can get to know each other.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:55.710
But I forgot to bring my phone today.

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.350
Toy was rushing me this morning.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.060
At least I didn't forget to bring my wallet.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:04.910
Wait. You're the one who created my Instagram account.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.770
You can work on it for me.

00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:09.200
Fine.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.710
I think what Frank said sounds reasonable.

00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:18.140
You should let her know who you are so she will be impressed.

00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:20.480
You should be more than just an ordinary fan.

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:22.420
What should I do?

00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:24.020
(Q is the person who gives you the egg tarts)

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.080
You want me to hold balloons and toss petals all over the field.

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:30.350
Or maybe I can light up the candles in the classroom.

00:16:30.950 --> 00:16:32.100
Something like that?

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.480
I won't do that. It's embarrassing.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.020
What kind of girl would be interested in a weakling like you?

00:16:39.310 --> 00:16:41.700
What kind of girl would be interested in a weakling like you?

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.110
Huh?

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:45.820
I know what to do.

00:16:46.110 --> 00:16:49.240
Girls like boys who are strong and protective.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:57.170
While Mook is walking, I'll run towards her and push her into the road.

00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.840
I will ride my bike and honk the horn to scare her.

00:17:02.130 --> 00:17:03.660
And then

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.770
it's your turn.

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:15.750
Thank you so much... er...

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.220
Q. My name is Q.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:21.740
It's you!

00:17:22.330 --> 00:17:23.950
Prince Egg Tarts.

00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.880
You're the one who's been liking my pictures on Instagram.

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.480
Are you sure that this plan will work?

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:54.600
You don't understand how impressive it is to have someone risking their life to protect you from harm.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.370
How do we know that she will be in the spot we want?

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.550
About that...

00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:02.750
You don't have to worry.

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:05.950
Because I have done my research.

00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:09.170
Whenever she comes to school, her car will always drop her off and pick her up at the same spot.

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:12.680
So, this evening, let's begin our...

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:14.680
"Hero Q..."

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.020
"Gives The Hot Girl A Thrill" mission.

00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:23.730
We'll fail for sure.
