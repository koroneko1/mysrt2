Thank you. Now, come on, you guys,

07:13.242 --> 07:16.109
What's goin' on ? Does Mother Superior
really know you're here ?

07:16.212 --> 07:18.680
She sent us
on this m-mission to--

07:18.748 --> 07:21.216
The Reverend Mother said
we're not to come back without you.

07:21.284 --> 07:23.878
<i>- What does she want ?
- [ Mary Patrick ]
We're not entirely certain.</i>

07:23.953 --> 07:27.514
But we know that she needs you and she
wants us to come and bring you back.

07:27.590 --> 07:29.717
Is she okay ? Health-wise ?
Is she in danger ?

07:29.792 --> 07:32.852
Oh, no, she's fine. Well,
she's a little desperate.

Oh, Sister Mary Clar--
Oh, I do apologize. Deloris.

08:55.378 --> 08:59.109
- Uh-huh.
- It's so good to see you too.

08:59.181 --> 09:03.117
I'm sorry I couldn't join
the Sisters in Las Vegas.

09:03.185 --> 09:06.279
I've heard you are
truly a spectacle.

09:06.355 --> 09:08.880
Well, yeah, you know,
I work at it.

09:08.991 --> 09:12.791
You're probably wondering why I asked
the Sisters to bring you here.

09:12.862 --> 09:15.558
I am a little curious.
What's all the mystery ?

09:15.665 --> 09:20.796
Well, you see, Deloris,
we need your help here...

09:23.072 --> 09:25.063
at St. Francis.

09:25.174 --> 09:30.737
We seem to have got in
slightly over our heads.

09:30.846 --> 09:33.041
What... do you want ?

09:33.149 --> 09:36.380
Help us
by becoming a teacher.

09:36.485 --> 09:39.215
A teacher ? Me ?

09:39.322 --> 09:41.222
Oh, no.

Who would I teach ?
What would I teach ?

09:45.728 --> 09:48.822
Teach the children.
Teach music.

09:48.898 --> 09:52.994
You weren't cut out to be a nun either,
but look what you accomplished
at St. Katherine's.

09:53.069 --> 09:56.766
You brought a new spirit into
the convent and into the community.

09:56.872 --> 09:59.432
You were... infectious.

09:59.542 --> 10:01.510
You could be just
as infectious here.

10:01.577 --> 10:04.512
You're making me
sound like a disease.

10:04.580 --> 10:08.072
We are struggling here with
a community that is tired...

10:08.184 --> 10:10.846
and worn
and despairing.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.856
We saw this school
as some sort of renewal,

10:14.924 --> 10:18.189
but it's becoming
a hopeless situation.

10:18.260 --> 10:21.229
<i>We have nowhere
else to turn.</i>

10:21.297 --> 10:23.925
We are desperate women,

<i>We need you.</i>

10:27.236 --> 10:31.798
<i>- Oh ! I'm--
- Think of the children.</i>

10:31.907 --> 10:34.876
We must invest in their future.
It is our duty.

10:34.944 --> 10:37.378
Who better to help us
than you ?

10:37.446 --> 10:39.539
I'm a lounge singer.

10:39.615 --> 10:43.051
You are the perfect example
of how a sow's ear...

10:43.119 --> 10:46.816
can be turned
into a silk purse.

10:46.922 --> 10:49.914
Hmm.

10:49.992 --> 10:52.893
Well, I probably wouldn't have
put it quite like that.

10:52.962 --> 10:55.123
I mean, look.
I mean, really.

10:55.231 --> 10:59.395
My career's starting to take off.
I kind of want to get into my success.

10:59.468 --> 11:02.096
A success you might not
have had...

11:02.171 --> 11:05.971
without the help of
certain supportive friends...

11:06.075 --> 11:08.100
who shall remain nameless.

11:08.177 --> 11:11.578
Oh, so you're going to be like
that, huh, with the guilt ?

11:11.647 --> 11:15.105
Guilt ?
I would never use guilt.

11:15.184 --> 11:17.175
I'm a nun.

11:17.286 --> 11:19.777
All right,
I'll do it for you.

11:19.855 --> 11:23.450
Oh, thank you, Deloris.
I knew we could count on you.

11:23.526 --> 11:26.120
But you're just talking
about like a week, right ?

11:26.195 --> 11:30.427
I don't think we should restrict
ourselves to a time frame.

11:30.499 --> 11:33.127
Sisters, Sisters.

11:35.671 --> 11:39.869
Deloris has agreed
to join our teaching staff.

11:39.975 --> 11:44.435
- So, could you take her
to the changing room ?
- Sure, absolutely.

11:44.513 --> 11:46.674
He--

11:46.782 --> 11:48.716
[ Deloris ] Somebody tell me
why I'm dressed like this again.

11:48.818 --> 11:51.514
The Fathers here
at St. Francis are very strict.

11:51.620 --> 11:55.021
If they were to find out you're neither
a nun or a teacher, they might--

11:55.124 --> 11:57.456
- Ask me to leave ?
- In a New York minute.

11:57.526 --> 12:00.893
- Yeah, well, now, I'm undercover again.
- It could be fun.

12:00.996 --> 12:03.863
- Convent living is kind of grim.
- All I need is a bed...

12:03.966 --> 12:07.402
- and a place to kneel.
- Wait until you see what
we have in the room for you.

12:07.503 --> 12:10.199
- You didn't go out and do
something silly, did you ?
- Well, maybe.

12:10.306 --> 12:12.638
- What did you put in, a bidet ?
- A bi-what ?

12:12.708 --> 12:15.802
- Never mind. What is it ?
- A watched pot never boils.

12:15.878 --> 12:17.971
- No, no, don't tell her.
It's a surprise.
- Okay.

12:18.047 --> 12:22.381

But my favorite,
my absolute all-time favorite,

29:43.224 --> 29:46.887
are the girl groups

32:41.269 --> 32:43.794
- We know it's unfortunate.
- We don't like it either.

32:43.905 --> 32:48.933
The Archdiocese has decided St. Francis
should close at the end of the semester.

32:49.043 --> 32:51.568
Why does it have
to happen so quickly ?

32:51.646 --> 32:53.978
You're totally in the red with
very little hope of recovery.

32:54.082 --> 32:58.883
You must realize, Father, the community
contributions have been nil.

The school has no outstanding
academic or achievement records.

is to close.

33:13.434 --> 33:16.995
Well, I suppose there's
nothing more to be said.

33:17.105 --> 33:20.074
Well, thank you.

33:30.485 --> 33:32.919
Mr. Crisp, you should be

analysis of the situation.

33:36.157 --> 33:38.421
Thank you very much,

33:38.493 --> 33:41.826
you'd consider my application
for early retirement.

33:41.929 --> 33:44.454
After all, I have been working for
the Archdiocese doing this work...

33:44.532 --> 33:48.468

33:48.536 --> 33:51.471

34:05.453 --> 34:07.512
- What ?
- What ?
- When ?

34:07.622 --> 34:10.216
- The end of the semester.
- Where did you hear that ?

34:10.324 --> 34:14.784
I happened to be eavesdropping

34:14.862 --> 34:20.232
We were afraid this might happen.
I've been expecting it for some time.

<i>- What do we do now ?

34:22.837 --> 34:27.399

What a stupid thing to do. This is
the only school left in this community.

34:32.146 --> 34:36.549
We've got to do something.
Otherwise we're gonna lose our

- Sister Mary Clarence.

35:06.447 --> 35:10.781
- Yes, as a matter of fact.
- I am familiar with the dilemma.

35:10.885 --> 35:14.184
I'm told that she presided at
the ecclesiastical equivalent...

35:14.255 --> 35:16.780
of a pep rally
last night.

35:16.891 --> 35:19.883
- Yes, I am aware of this.
- You are ? How did you know ?

35:19.961 --> 35:23.522
You'll find that when one deals
with Sister Mary Clarence,

35:23.598 --> 35:26.863
one is smothered with more information
than one wishes to possess.

35:26.934 --> 35:29.528
I'm afraid she's becoming
quite disruptive.

35:29.604 --> 35:33.267
Disruption is the way
Mary Clarence communicates.

35:33.374 --> 35:37.140
I worry about raising
false hopes among the children.

35:37.245 --> 35:41.739
Advise me, Reverend Mother.
Tell me about your experiences
with Mary Clarence.

35:41.816 --> 35:44.717
No, I wouldn't
want to frighten you.

35:44.785 --> 35:50.314
But in my experience,
I found it easier and ultimately...

35:50.424 --> 35:54.952
quite effective to give
Mary Clarence a free hand.

35:55.062 --> 35:57.724
Aren't her ideas
extremely radical ?

35:57.798 --> 36:00.494
If I remember correctly,

36:00.601 --> 36:03.832
the term ''radical'' was
applied to us in our day.

36:03.938 --> 36:07.339
Or have you forgotten the trouble
we caused Bishop O'Malley ?

36:07.441 --> 36:10.103
- Oh, yes, Bishop O'Malley.

36:10.178 --> 36:14.239

the road to closure,
