Where did you go? Where?

41:22.580 --> 41:24.514

41:25.716 --> 41:27.445
What's road? What's road?

41:28.586 --> 41:29.780
With whom? With whom did you go?

41:31.388 --> 41:32.514

41:33.324 --> 41:36.623
Are you out of your mind? Are
you out of your bloody mind?

41:37.328 --> 41:38.488
You were wondering alone in the city.

41:39.330 --> 41:41.230
Hadn't you bothered
a bit about us? ldiot.

41:41.932 --> 41:43.593
What's going on here? Did you listen?

41:44.034 --> 41:45.831
lf he had been lost then how
can we able to look after him?

41:48.706 --> 41:51.300
And who wrote this? Who
wrote this absent note?

41:52.576 --> 41:54.771
You aren't able to write
properly, bloody, duffer, idiot.

41:55.446 --> 41:56.674
You could pass if you are
able to write that much.

41:57.681 --> 41:58.739
Who wrote this note, lshaan?

41:59.316 --> 42:00.408
Speak, who wrote this?

42:01.552 --> 42:05.386

42:18.636 --> 42:21.628
Class work and homework, haven't
any improvement in both of it.

42:22.640 --> 42:23.800
Just like the last year.

42:24.542 --> 42:28.979
Book is still his enemies. Like
read and write is punishment.

42:30.014 --> 42:32.642
His English handwriting
seems to be Russian sometimes.

42:34.552 --> 42:38.750
He repeat the mistakes without any reason. He's
always attentive towards the outside of the class.

42:39.256 --> 42:41.559
All the time asking for
permission to go to the toilet.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.627
l'm thirsty. l want to do pee.

42:43.627 --> 42:45.595
Thirsty, pee... thirsty, pee.

42:46.297 --> 42:48.492

42:49.266 --> 42:53.430
And have you been through with his exam

Math's test. 3x9=3, enough. After
that he left all the questions.

43:19.296 --> 43:21.594
Who would accept that he's the
younger brother of Yohaan Awasthi?

43:28.706 --> 43:30.571
- Mr. Awasthi.
- Yes.

43:32.476 --> 43:35.468
By the way this is the second
year of your son in third standard.

43:36.814 --> 43:40.875
lf it's running such like that then l'm
sorry l wouldn't able to help you out.

43:43.654 --> 43:45.485
Maybe he's having some problem.

43:47.257 --> 43:47.518
What do you mean?

43:48.692 --> 43:53.629
Maybe he... Some children are unlucky.

43:54.531 --> 43:57.557
And there are special kind of
schools for these kind of children.

44:04.441 --> 44:06.341
- Water, sir.
- Get a side.

44:06.443 --> 44:07.878

44:20.324 --> 44:23.885
Thinks my son is a retard.
She thinks my son isn't normal.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.332
Err! They filled up the
class with 60 children.

44:28.332 --> 44:30.357
Teacher wouldn't able to
pay attention on every child.

44:30.901 --> 44:33.563
Bloody nonsense. ldiots.

44:36.607 --> 44:40.771
What l hadn't done? l did the job

founder trusty of the school.

45:11.475 --> 45:13.443

Then where will we go?

45:42.840 --> 45:45.536

45:53.417 --> 45:55.442
Today he asked Yohaan to write a note,
don't know what he'll do tomorrow?

46:00.691 --> 46:02.454

46:03.427 --> 46:06.453

Very good. Yes lshaan Anand Kishor Awasthi

56:21.711 --> 56:30.449
What we see, we feel it exists and what
we can't see we feel it isn't exists.

56:31.454 --> 56:35.413
But sometimes what we see, isn't true.

56:36.259 --> 56:41.464
And what isn't visible, is true. Means.

ways. And the flow of the stream rises again.

lshaan, what are you
doing? What are you doing?

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:35.250
Come down. Down.

01:07:48.864 --> 01:07:49.922
Why did you climb up?

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:53.294
Come.

01:07:56.972 --> 01:07:57.666
What happen?

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:01.737
Err! Don't you know, he's gone.

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:05.778
Holkar sir has been gone to teach
drawing to the whole New Zealand.

01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:12.651
A new temporary teacher has joined in his
place. l hope he is different from Holkar sir.

01:08:14.356 --> 01:08:15.448
Lets go. lt's already late.

01:08:16.392 --> 01:08:16.790
Lets go.

01:14:39.274 --> 01:14:43.404
Have it, this is yours, this
is yours and that's yours.

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:46.538
Draw, paint and do
whatever you want to do.

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:48.908
Till now l be back by dropping this.

01:14:49.785 --> 01:14:53.243
But what we paint sir there
is nothing on the table.

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:56.216
This table.

01:14:58.627 --> 01:15:03.428
This table is very small sweetheart, that much
small so it isn't bare your beautiful thoughts.

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:09.271
Look in to your mind and draw
an amazing Technicolor photo.

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:10.533
and drop it on the paper.

01:15:12.207 --> 01:15:15.574
Steal, steal the joy.
Nobody is here to stop you.

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:02.247
Where were you been lost friend?

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:05.358
Are you looking for
something in thoughts?

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:10.625
Nothing to worry and rush.

01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:19.422
What happen kid?

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.464

What is your name son?

01:17:34.883 --> 01:17:37.477
Sir his name is lshaan Awasthi.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:41.319
Thanks.

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:05.505
Where did you go? Where did you go?

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:07.447
Your mother called.

01:18:08.183 --> 01:18:10.651
Go and stand by the phone,
she's going to call again.

01:18:29.371 --> 01:18:30.572

01:18:30.572 --> 01:18:33.642

l know you are very angry with Mama.

01:19:03.705 --> 01:19:05.240
Mama is very bad.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:06.332
Mama is very bad.

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:13.313
l'm very sorry Enoo
but what can Mama do?

01:19:14.483 --> 01:19:17.452
Dada is also having the
tension of finals. lsn't it?

01:19:18.487 --> 01:19:19.554
Would you like to talk to Dada?

01:19:19.554 --> 01:19:23.456
Now talk to Dada. And wish him all
the best, one minute... one minute.

01:19:24.559 --> 01:19:28.359
Hello Enoo. Hello Enoo are you there?

01:19:30.499 --> 01:19:34.492

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:38.499
- Hello.

01:19:38.774 --> 01:19:40.241

Son talk to Mama.

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:47.543

Sorry.

01:19:56.691 --> 01:20:01.856
- What happen?
- He hadn't talked?

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:05.432
Don't worry we'll go next Sunday.

01:20:11.606 --> 01:20:15.610
- Err! Why are you putting it there?
- This is the class work of the kids.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:19.569
Then what happened? Holkar didn't put
it there. That place is for the books.

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:22.751
Then where do l put them.
Return them to the kids.

01:20:22.751 --> 01:20:24.378
By the way are they for any use?

01:20:25.554 --> 01:20:30.287
What the wreckage they are
making in your class Nikumbh?

01:20:31.026 --> 01:20:32.823
They are the kids,
the have to make noise.

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:35.430
And if the kids wouldn't
show there emotions in

01:20:35.430 --> 01:20:36.897
...the art class then
where else they would show them.

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:42.260
That's alright. Just go easy. Headmaster
wants the discipline in the school. Discipline.

01:20:45.574 --> 01:20:47.633
l heard that you were
singing the class yesterday.

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:50.344
And playing the flute.

01:20:51.446 --> 01:20:52.970
Yes l was singing and playing the flute.

01:20:54.382 --> 01:20:55.713
Kids happy so l'm happy.

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:58.611
But the children of this school isn't
like the children of that school.

01:21:00.555 --> 01:21:01.317
What kind of children?

01:21:06.461 --> 01:21:07.587
You are teaching in tulips school.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:11.355
Mentally retorted abnormal kids.

01:21:12.267 --> 01:21:14.469
Teach the way you like in
that kind of school, it doesn't

01:21:14.469 --> 01:21:16.630
...makes any difference. No future
wouldn't be made of that kids.

01:21:17.639 --> 01:21:20.342
No serious teaching. This
is a formal school, your

01:21:20.342 --> 01:21:23.411
...singing, dancing style
wouldn't be appreciated over here.

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:25.174
Here we prepare the kids for the race of life.
Kids have to compete, succeed. Make a future.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:34.756
Three rules of our school.
Unity, faith and discipline.

01:21:34.756 --> 01:21:38.817
Three rules of success, the
way of complete education.

01:21:42.030 --> 01:21:42.689
Hail Hitler.

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:48.569
Tevari-ji now you have to learn German.

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:01.875
What happen lshaan?

01:22:04.352 --> 01:22:06.388
Okay... Okay... Okay... Okay...

01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:07.184
lt's okay.

01:22:38.553 --> 01:22:40.453
Err! Listen, where is your friend?

01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:45.248
Sir, don't know sir. He was
here by now, suddenly he ran off.

01:22:46.628 --> 01:22:48.964
He saw his new boring art teacher.

01:22:48.964 --> 01:22:51.660
No... No sir, he went to the
dinning hall for the lunch.

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:55.537
What is your name friend?

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:57.266
Rajan Dhamodhran sir.

01:22:57.672 --> 01:23:00.008
Rajan tell me one thing,
what is the matter of lshaan?

01:23:00.008 --> 01:23:02.978
- Sir.
- ls he having some problem?

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:04.445
He's afraid all the time.

01:23:04.746 --> 01:23:07.374
- He wants to go home.
- Why?

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:10.841
- He's a new boy sir.
- ln the middle of the year.

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:14.556
He's having a problem.
As much he can try but he

01:23:14.556 --> 01:23:17.923
...can't read and write. He
has been punished all the time.

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:21.493
Red marks all over the book. What to do?

01:25:41.402 --> 01:25:43.267
You play here, l'll be right back.
Ok?

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:15.259
Are you coming from somewhere
after cutting onions?

01:26:21.409 --> 01:26:23.900
The human is...
- worse then animals.

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:24.609
l know that.

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:25.940
And blind too.

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:28.181
Away from the inner beauty.

01:26:30.218 --> 01:26:30.946
Who you're confronting these days?

01:26:33.354 --> 01:26:34.378
Myself.

01:26:35.523 --> 01:26:37.286
After so long, l'm seeing
myself in the mirror.

01:26:37.992 --> 01:26:39.425
So is there someone to
show you the mirror?

01:26:40.495 --> 01:26:41.655
That's what l always ask you to.

01:26:41.996 --> 01:26:43.293
You have a nice face.

01:26:44.299 --> 01:26:47.894
Jabeen, he's in danger.

01:26:49.470 --> 01:26:50.937
Who?

01:26:54.008 --> 01:26:54.940
Who?

01:26:56.744 --> 01:26:58.644
There's a boy in the school

01:26:59.614 --> 01:27:02.412
He's 8-9 years old.

01:27:03.651 --> 01:27:07.143
He doesn't do or speak anything,
always seems scared.

01:27:08.590 --> 01:27:12.321
His eyes are like...
screaming for help.

01:27:16.231 --> 01:27:18.222
l'm afraid he'll fall.

01:27:25.707 --> 01:27:28.175
Let's go, it's time for the lesson.

01:27:28.309 --> 01:27:29.207
Ok, lets go.

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.946
Hey, Sail, come. Do you know
what's the time of the show?

01:27:34.282 --> 01:27:35.374
After two days.

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:38.916
Yes.
Excellent, let's go.

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:26.189
Yes?
Hello.

01:33:26.300 --> 01:33:27.562
My name's Ram Shankar Nikum.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:30.267
l teach at New Era School.

01:33:32.506 --> 01:33:33.200
Come in.

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.275
Are these his 3rd standard books?
- Yes.

01:33:50.291 --> 01:33:51.223
Who made this?

01:33:52.259 --> 01:33:52.725
lshaan did.

01:33:54.295 --> 01:33:55.660
lshaan did?
Does he paint?

01:33:56.797 --> 01:33:58.287
Yes, he loves to paint.

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:37.421
Can l have some water please?

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:04.588
Why did you send him?

01:36:06.260 --> 01:36:06.555
Why?

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.251
There was no choice.

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:11.888
Last year he failed in 3rd standard.

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:13.530
Can you believe?
ln 3rd standard.

01:36:13.634 --> 01:36:15.534
And there's no sign of
improvement.

01:36:15.636 --> 01:36:18.161
This, my elder son, he comes 1st
in every class every subject.

01:36:18.272 --> 01:36:19.239
And that other one...

01:36:21.275 --> 01:36:22.469
What do you think, what
his problem is?

01:36:22.576 --> 01:36:24.476
Problem? His attitude. What else?

01:36:24.578 --> 01:36:29.174
Towards studies, towards everything.
Always stubborn, always attitude.

01:36:30.317 --> 01:36:33.252
l'm asking about his problem,
but you're telling me the symptoms.

01:36:33.354 --> 01:36:35.379
You're telling me he has the fever,
that's l know already.

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:37.618
l'm asking why is he having fever.

01:36:38.692 --> 01:36:39.886
What's the reason of the fever?

01:36:42.296 --> 01:36:43.320
Then you tell me.

01:36:44.698 --> 01:36:45.460
Tell me.

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:53.206
Have you noticed any pattern
in his mistakes in his lessons?

01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:54.604
Pattern. What pattern?

01:36:54.742 --> 01:36:56.266
They all are mistakes.

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:57.542
Then you couldn't notice
the patterns.

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:06.345
Look here.

01:37:08.289 --> 01:37:10.223
Here ''b'' is in place of ''d''
and ''d'' in place of ''b''

01:37:11.225 --> 01:37:13.352
Confusion among similar
looking alphabets.

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:17.196
Here, he wrote ''s'' and ''r''
in reverse. Even more...

01:37:17.298 --> 01:37:17.923
Look here.

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:20.200
This small ''h'' and small ''t''

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:21.563
Mirror imaging.

01:37:23.237 --> 01:37:25.899
Animal, animal, animal. Three different
spellings on the same page.

01:37:27.274 --> 01:37:29.265
lt means, it's not the case that
he remembers one wrong spelling.

01:37:30.277 --> 01:37:32.336
He mixes similar looking words.

01:37:32.513 --> 01:37:34.504
This ''t-o-p'' becomes ''p-o-t''

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.874
This ''s-o-l-i-d'' become ''s-o-i-l-d''.

01:37:40.287 --> 01:37:40.912
Why does he do that?

01:37:41.989 --> 01:37:43.513
ls he stupid, or lazy?

01:37:44.625 --> 01:37:45.319
No

01:37:46.293 --> 01:37:49.228
l think, he's having difficulty
in recognizing words.

01:37:52.233 --> 01:37:56.192
When you read ''a-p-p-l-e'' apple,
you imagine a red apple in your head.

01:37:56.604 --> 01:37:58.333
Maybe he can't read ''apple''

01:37:58.672 --> 01:37:59.934
That's why he can't
get the meaning as well.

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:07.203
To learn, one has to know the sounds,
visual and meanings of words.

01:38:09.216 --> 01:38:11.184
lshaan is lacking this
very important need.

01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:14.187
To skip the studies.

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:27.931
Read this please.

01:38:31.639 --> 01:38:33.504
How can l read it?
lt's in Chinese.

01:38:33.641 --> 01:38:35.506
Try it.
Come on. Concentrate.

01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:37.907
What's this rubbish?

01:38:38.212 --> 01:38:40.203
You're not behaving.

01:38:40.347 --> 01:38:41.405
You're being rascal.

01:38:50.658 --> 01:38:52.649
That's how lshaan must be feeling.

01:38:54.228 --> 01:38:55.388
He couldn't understand
the words.

01:39:00.234 --> 01:39:03.260
This problem in studies
is called as ''Dyslexia''.

01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:16.215
Sometimes child has some more
problems other then Dyslexia.

01:39:16.350 --> 01:39:19.649
Like difficulty in understanding

01:39:19.954 --> 01:39:23.185
Turn to page 65, chapter 9,
Para 4, line 2

01:39:23.290 --> 01:39:24.188
Confusion...

01:39:24.291 --> 01:39:28.352
Or Poor Final Gross Motus Skills.

01:39:28.462 --> 01:39:32.159
Does lshaan feel problems in
buttoning his shirt or tying his shoelace?

01:39:32.266 --> 01:39:33.255
Yes

01:39:33.367 --> 01:39:36.234
Can he catch the ball
when you throw it to him?

01:39:36.337 --> 01:39:38.862
He can never judge the ball.

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:42.204
Because he can't understand the size,
distance and speed all together.

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:46.211
A ball, how big, from how far and
at what speed coming towards him.

01:39:46.347 --> 01:39:47.905
Until he analyze all this...

01:39:48.215 --> 01:39:49.182
lt's too late.

01:39:54.989 --> 01:39:56.547
Think about it.

01:39:57.424 --> 01:40:00.359
A child
Just 8-9 years old.

01:40:02.262 --> 01:40:04.423
Can't do day to day normal things.

01:40:04.531 --> 01:40:08.262
Can't do what other children
can do very easily.

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:11.234
What could he go through then?

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:14.607
His self-confidence must have
been shattered.

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:21.270
He must have been fighting by hiding
his inabilities under stubbornness.

01:40:21.382 --> 01:40:22.940
He must have been making a
hell out here.

01:40:26.553 --> 01:40:28.316
Thinking, that why should he tell the
world that he can't do things.

01:40:28.422 --> 01:40:30.253
Why shouldn't he get all that ignored
by just saying that he doesn't want to do.

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:31.322
That's what children learn from the elders.

01:40:38.032 --> 01:40:40.262
And now he can't even
continue to fight that.

01:40:42.970 --> 01:40:47.600
l'm sorry to say that
he has stopped painting.

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.008
lt's very sad.

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.446
Why only lshaan?

01:41:04.391 --> 01:41:05.881
There's no answer to that.

01:41:06.326 --> 01:41:08.191
lt's a Neurological Disorder.
lt can happen to anyone.

01:41:08.295 --> 01:41:10.229
Sometimes it can be genetic.

01:41:10.330 --> 01:41:14.323
To make it simple, there's just
some wiring problems in his brain.

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:18.370
So you're saying that my son
isn't normal, he's mentally retarded.

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:20.567
What kind of a person you are?

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:24.409
Look this, Mrs. Awasti?

01:41:24.511 --> 01:41:27.207
This fast brain is playing with
thousands of thoughts with colors.

01:41:27.347 --> 01:41:29.247
Way more then yours and mine abilities.

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:30.281
But what's the use of that?

01:41:30.384 --> 01:41:31.976
What are you looking into it?

01:41:32.286 --> 01:41:33.218
Then what should l look?

01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:34.378
What will he become when
he'll grow up?

01:41:35.389 --> 01:41:36.879
How will he compete with
the world?

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:39.915
Will l keep on feeding
him for whole of his life?

01:41:53.640 --> 01:41:55.267
l know this.

01:41:56.376 --> 01:41:57.900
There's a cold world out there.

01:41:59.513 --> 01:42:03.347
Everyone wants to grow toppers
and rankers in their homes.

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:08.254
Everyone wants No. 1

01:42:08.355 --> 01:42:11.324
Doctor, engineer, management,
less then that is unacceptable.

01:42:17.231 --> 01:42:18.459
lsn't it?

01:42:20.234 --> 01:42:21.201
Think about this.

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:27.331
Every child has his own quality,
own expertise, own desire.

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:29.240
But no,

01:42:30.377 --> 01:42:32.277
Everyone is busy stretching the
finger to make it long.

01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.914
Keep on doing that.
No matter you break the very finger.

01:42:41.021 --> 01:42:42.488
What's are the options?
- No options.

01:42:43.423 --> 01:42:44.253
There's no way.

01:42:45.559 --> 01:42:47.959
lf you like horse to race, then
breed race horses, damn it.

01:42:48.495 --> 01:42:49.655
Why do you give birth to children?

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:57.468
Putting the weight of your ambitions
on your child, is worse then child labor.

01:43:01.308 --> 01:43:02.605
And when the child can't
carry the weight...

01:43:06.346 --> 01:43:07.574
When you will understand?

01:43:07.681 --> 01:43:10.206
That every child has his own
capacity to lift the weight.

01:43:10.317 --> 01:43:12.285
He learns eventually.

01:43:12.386 --> 01:43:15.355
Every child has own pace.
Five fingers make a fist.

01:43:21.728 --> 01:43:25.391
Why are we dreaming to settle
these little ones in to the mainstream?

01:45:27.454 --> 01:45:31.550
Friends, l'm going to tell
a story today.

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:37.295
A story about a boy.

01:45:42.402 --> 01:45:44.393
There was a boy, don't ask where.

01:45:44.504 --> 01:45:48.201
He couldn't read and write.
Even after so many tries.

01:45:48.342 --> 01:45:51.573
He couldn't remember that ''y''
comes after ''x''.

01:45:51.712 --> 01:45:55.409
Words were his enemies,
used to dance in front of his eyes.

01:45:55.515 --> 01:45:59.383
They used to tease him by
dancing and moving around.

01:46:01.188 --> 01:46:03.179
Studies used to make him tired.

01:46:05.225 --> 01:46:08.160
His mind was full, he was a starter bull,
and the alphabets were disco to him.

01:46:10.263 --> 01:46:11.423
He failed in the exams.

01:46:11.531 --> 01:46:13.465
He was a victim of the burden
of the studies.

01:46:13.567 --> 01:46:15.592
People called him an ass
and stupid.

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:18.535
Boy took everything bravely.

01:46:18.638 --> 01:46:21.937
And one day, he did something genius.

01:46:22.275 --> 01:46:24.539
Everyone was shocked when
heard his theory.

01:46:24.678 --> 01:46:26.578
Tell me, who's that boy?

01:46:35.589 --> 01:46:36.556
Elbert Einstein.

01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:38.915
Correct Rajan,
Albert Einstein.

01:46:39.226 --> 01:46:40.386
Genius and great scientist.

01:46:40.494 --> 01:46:44.260
Who shocked the world with his
theory of relativity.

01:46:50.370 --> 01:46:52.429
Now tell me what's this?

01:46:57.577 --> 01:47:00.910
No, no.
lt's not an ordinary helicopter.

01:47:01.648 --> 01:47:02.740
The great artist inventor,
Leonardo DiVinci

01:47:04.451 --> 01:47:07.511
Who?
- Leonardo DiVinci

01:47:07.621 --> 01:47:08.485
Yes,

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:11.250
he made this picture.

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:12.325
A working sketch of a helicopter.

01:47:12.426 --> 01:47:13.450
But when?

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:14.527
ln the 15th century.

01:47:14.628 --> 01:47:17.256
400 years before the first
airplane could fly.

01:47:19.466 --> 01:47:23.300
Do you know, Leonardo DiVinci used
to have difficulties to read and write.

01:47:24.204 --> 01:47:25.432
He used to write like this.

01:47:44.257 --> 01:47:46.452
Can you make anything out of it?

01:47:54.301 --> 01:47:55.563
Now read it.

01:47:57.237 --> 01:48:01.537
My name is Ram Shankar Nikum.

01:48:09.216 --> 01:48:11.514
lshaan, turn on the light please.

01:48:20.527 --> 01:48:23.894
Who was the great person,
who lit the world with electricity?

01:48:24.197 --> 01:48:25.255
Edison.

01:48:26.533 --> 01:48:27.625
Thomas Edison.

01:48:27.734 --> 01:48:29.201
Correct lshaan.

01:48:30.504 --> 01:48:32.369
He too was a victim of ''abcd''.

01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:34.204
Sit down lshaan.

01:48:34.341 --> 01:48:35.535
No leave the light on.

01:48:36.476 --> 01:48:38.273
Let Edison's light come on us.

01:48:48.321 --> 01:48:50.255
Everyone must know him.
- Abhishek Bachchan.

01:48:55.395 --> 01:48:58.193
He too used to have difficulties
in studies during childhood.

01:48:58.298 --> 01:49:00.198
Now see, he is a blast.

01:49:06.239 --> 01:49:09.868
There are more examples.
Pablo Picasso, famous painter.

01:49:12.212 --> 01:49:14.305
He used to say, ''lt looks
like my uncle's nose in reverse. ''

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:20.152
Who's the father of Mickey Mouse?
- Walt Disney.

01:49:20.253 --> 01:49:21.447
Correct.
Walt Disney.

01:49:21.555 --> 01:49:24.581
He was too confused about words,
so he put his art into cartoons.

01:49:27.227 --> 01:49:30.492
He used to write songs out of the
shame about his red report card.

01:49:31.331 --> 01:49:33.162
Agatha Christy, famous mystery book writer.

01:49:33.934 --> 01:49:36.869
Can you believe a writer, who was
unable to read in her childhood.

01:49:38.572 --> 01:49:42.201
But, why am l telling you all
this suddenly today?

01:49:45.278 --> 01:49:51.308
To show you that, there were gems
in the world who changed it.

01:49:52.252 --> 01:49:54.447
They were able to see
the world from their eyes.

01:49:55.255 --> 01:49:58.486
Their minds were a bit different.

01:49:58.592 --> 01:50:00.253
People came in their ways.

01:50:01.294 --> 01:50:02.352
But still they won.

01:50:02.462 --> 01:50:04.521
And they won like that the whole
world saw it in an awe.

01:50:06.433 --> 01:50:10.233
Out today's art class will be
dedicated to all those geniuses.

01:50:11.738 --> 01:50:14.935
We will step out remembering them.

01:50:15.275 --> 01:50:16.936
And we'll make something different.
Anything.

01:50:17.410 --> 01:50:19.571
Pick anything you like,
rock, wood, junk, anything.

01:50:22.248 --> 01:50:23.977
Come on, move towards the door.

01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:38.554
lshaan, one minute.

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:40.924
Rajan, you can go.

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:54.007
Do you know there was another name
among all those l mentioned?

01:50:57.417 --> 01:51:00.250
Because that name is not that great.

01:51:02.956 --> 01:51:05.516
But he too had the same problem.

01:51:09.295 --> 01:51:13.197
That name is Ram Shankar Nikum.

01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:23.300
l too had difficulties in
reading and writing.

01:51:24.477 --> 01:51:26.308
My father never understood me.

01:51:27.380 --> 01:51:30.975
He thought l was being naughty,
and wasn't paying attention.

01:51:32.519 --> 01:51:35.215
He thought l would not succeed
in my future.

01:51:36.723 --> 01:51:38.623
What a duffer and idiot could become?

01:51:42.562 --> 01:51:46.362
Whatever l am today,
l'm in front of you lshaan.

01:51:52.972 --> 01:51:53.563
Shall we go?

01:51:56.342 --> 01:51:57.900
Did you go to my home?

01:53:31.604 --> 01:53:33.265
Hey, it's moving.

01:53:55.562 --> 01:53:57.291
Can it fly?

01:53:58.031 --> 01:53:59.259
Will it?

01:53:59.365 --> 01:54:01.196
Who made it?

01:55:00.393 --> 01:55:01.417
ls Principal present?

01:55:01.527 --> 01:55:02.494
Yes sir.
- Ok, stay seated.

01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:16.469
l wanted to talk about a student.

01:55:17.577 --> 01:55:18.566
lshaan Awasti, 3rd ''D''

01:55:18.711 --> 01:55:19.643
He's a new student.

01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:23.212
Some other teachers are
also complaining about him.

01:55:25.752 --> 01:55:27.344
l don't think he could
even complete a year.

01:55:29.422 --> 01:55:31.356
No sir, he's a smart boy.

01:55:32.325 --> 01:55:34.225
He has just come problem
in reading and writing.

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:36.252
You know about ''Dyslexia''.

01:55:41.334 --> 01:55:43.302
You've made our job easy.

01:55:43.403 --> 01:55:47.339
l was confused what to tell his father.
He came through our trustees.

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:49.238
Good, good.

01:55:50.276 --> 01:55:52.437
Then Special School is perfect for him.
lsn't it?

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:55.308
No sir,

01:55:55.448 --> 01:55:56.642
He's a child with above
average intelligence.

01:55:59.385 --> 01:56:01.148
He has full right to study
in a normal school.

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:02.915
He just needs a little help from us.

01:56:05.258 --> 01:56:11.219
All children around the world having
any problem study in normal school.

01:56:12.598 --> 01:56:16.295
And these children have right
to study in any normal school.

01:56:21.207 --> 01:56:23.266
Under the law of rights of
education, every child gets this right.

01:56:25.712 --> 01:56:29.170
lt's another thing that there are less
schools who don't follow this law.

01:56:31.250 --> 01:56:35.243
Nikum, tell me one thing.
How will this boy manage here?

01:56:38.291 --> 01:56:41.192
He will.
Only if teachers help him a bit.

01:56:41.294 --> 01:56:43.194
Where's the time that teachers have?

01:56:43.329 --> 01:56:47.265
To attend one child
among 40 children?

01:56:47.367 --> 01:56:48.299
lmpossible.

01:56:48.401 --> 01:56:50.232
Sir, it won't take as much time
as you think.

01:56:51.337 --> 01:56:54.238
2-3 hours a week.

01:56:55.341 --> 01:56:58.276
And he has to just pass all these
subjects,

01:56:58.778 --> 01:57:00.268
his real destination is something else.

01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:06.180
So, all the subjects that we teach
are useless but yours isn't.

01:57:06.285 --> 01:57:10.221
No, sir, l didn't mean that.

01:57:17.563 --> 01:57:19.929
Please sir, look at his painting.

01:57:26.572 --> 01:57:28.563
lt's a battlefield, soldier digs a mine

01:57:28.708 --> 01:57:31.939
and turned the page and
escaped while digging.

01:57:32.278 --> 01:57:36.874
What an idea? Confident brush
strokes, such bold use of colors.

01:57:36.983 --> 01:57:38.280
Very bold.

01:57:40.219 --> 01:57:44.383
Look at this sir, a flip book,
story about getting away from home.

01:57:46.492 --> 01:57:49.256
What an idea?
From just an 8 years old boy.

01:57:51.264 --> 01:57:54.529
Sir, there are a few who
could think out of the way.

01:57:55.301 --> 01:57:58.668
Sir, just one chance.
He needs this chance.

01:57:58.971 --> 01:58:00.461
Or he'll loose his faith.

01:58:03.276 --> 01:58:04.470
What do you want from me?

01:58:05.511 --> 01:58:09.345
For some time, his spellings and
writing should be ignored.

01:58:10.383 --> 01:58:12.408
We should take his tests orally.

01:58:12.518 --> 01:58:15.214
Education is real be it
oral or written.

01:58:15.321 --> 01:58:17.255
By the time, l'll also work
on his reading and writing.

01:58:17.356 --> 01:58:19.153
That will be improved gradually.

01:58:24.630 --> 01:58:30.159
l don't know, if l'm doing a permanent
damage by following a temporary teacher.

02:00:35.561 --> 02:00:37.324
Now add 3

02:00:39.498 --> 02:00:40.897
Very good, now add 5

02:00:43.035 --> 02:00:44.002
What did you get?

02:00:45.338 --> 02:00:47.306
Very good, now subtract 11

02:02:10.456 --> 02:02:13.482
There's a question. Have you ever
painted after you finished your school.

02:02:14.327 --> 02:02:15.259
What?

02:02:21.233 --> 02:02:23.224
Painting competition.
For students, teachers, everyone.

02:02:30.376 --> 02:02:32.310
Seriously, what's the meaning or art.

02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:35.542
lt's meant to release your
emotions.

02:02:36.382 --> 02:02:39.647
lf you're happy, your hand will
reach all bright colors.

02:02:40.519 --> 02:02:43.977
Lunch was bad, you'll end up
filling with all dark and dull colors.

02:02:51.297 --> 02:02:51.888
l'll be back in two minutes, friends.

02:02:59.338 --> 02:03:00.327
Sorry, there's a little space.

02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:05.877
How come you're here?

02:03:06.212 --> 02:03:07.406
l was passing by.

02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:10.239
Have you met lshaan?
- No, not yet, l will meet him.

02:03:11.250 --> 02:03:12.308
First l needed to talk to you.

02:03:16.322 --> 02:03:18.882
My wife has been surfing internet
for a few days.

02:03:20.226 --> 02:03:22.319
She has read all the information
about ''Dyslexia''

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.219
We just wanted to you tell you that.

02:03:25.998 --> 02:03:27.329
Why did you want to tell me?

02:03:29.301 --> 02:03:34.898
So you don't mistake us as parents
who don't care about their children.

02:03:38.611 --> 02:03:42.206
To care.
lt necessary Mr. Awasti.

02:03:44.383 --> 02:03:46.351
lt has the power to cure.

02:03:47.319 --> 02:03:49.617
lt's a medicine that relieves pain.

02:03:52.391 --> 02:03:55.485
lt's a security that child thinks
someone cares about him.

02:03:57.263 --> 02:03:59.254
One hug, or one lovely kiss.

02:04:00.266 --> 02:04:02.666
To show that you care.

02:04:04.236 --> 02:04:06.261
To tell him, ''Son l love you''.

02:04:08.307 --> 02:04:13.506
''lf you have any worries,
you can come to me''.

02:04:13.612 --> 02:04:16.308
''lt's ok if you made a mistake,
l'm there for you. ''

02:04:19.251 --> 02:04:21.219
To care.

02:04:24.256 --> 02:04:25.587
lsn't it what's called ''to care''?

02:04:38.237 --> 02:04:42.333
l'm happy to hear that you
think you care.

02:04:52.651 --> 02:04:54.380
l'll leave now.

02:04:56.355 --> 02:04:58.323
Mr. Awasti,

02:04:59.024 --> 02:05:02.289
Has your wife read about
Solomon lslands on internet?

02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:07.231
l don't know.

02:05:13.239 --> 02:05:19.235
for farming, they don't cut the trees.
lnstead, they stand around the tree

02:05:19.345 --> 02:05:24.180
and start shouting at him,
cursing at him.

02:05:28.354 --> 02:05:32.882
ln some days,
the tree gets weak.

02:05:34.293 --> 02:05:35.555
And dies by itself.

02:07:27.740 --> 02:07:32.905
There has been great gems
in the world who changed it.

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:38.943
They were able to see
the world from their eyes.

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:42.546
Their minds were a bit different.

02:07:43.656 --> 02:07:47.285
People didn't like that and
they came in their ways.

02:07:49.695 --> 02:07:51.356
But still they won.

02:07:52.665 --> 02:07:56.465
And they won like that the whole
world saw it in an awe.

02:09:16.315 --> 02:09:17.407
What a fair they have arranged?

02:09:19.318 --> 02:09:20.250
Look, l have arrived.

02:09:39.204 --> 02:09:41.172
Where's your lshaan?
l've been dying to meet him.

02:09:42.307 --> 02:09:43.535
l don't know,
l can't see him.

02:09:44.510 --> 02:09:45.909
Rajan, where's lshaan?

02:09:46.211 --> 02:09:49.271
l don't know sir,
he left hostel before everyone.

02:09:50.315 --> 02:09:51.247
Really?

02:09:59.324 --> 02:10:01.554
Hey Nikum, you've pulled
me into this too.

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:04.296
You should try this,
it's fun.

02:10:04.296 --> 02:10:06.287
No way, l can't do this
painting thing.

02:10:10.602 --> 02:10:13.298
l will put so many alphabets
and fill it will alphabets.

02:10:16.575 --> 02:10:18.600
l've come here only for headmaster
to see my presence.

02:10:18.744 --> 02:10:22.339
l will be here for 5-10 minutes only.

02:10:22.447 --> 02:10:23.573
lt's an honor for us that
you've come.

02:10:23.682 --> 02:10:25.274
Where l have to sit?

02:10:25.384 --> 02:10:27.249
Children will show your sitting place.

02:10:27.352 --> 02:10:30.253
Children, come here.

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:32.352
Show to sir his sitting place.

02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:23.572
My special guest Madam Lalita

02:11:23.709 --> 02:11:27.304
Teacher, painter, my guru.

02:11:27.446 --> 02:11:29.607
Hello
- Hello

02:11:39.024 --> 02:11:40.548
Have you seen lshaan?

02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:43.351
No sir, he must be with Rajan.

02:12:22.968 --> 02:12:23.935
Where's he?

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:28.364
l don't know sir, as l said earlier
he left before everyone.

02:13:14.319 --> 02:13:16.617
Where had you been?
Come here, sit.

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:22.518
Do you have colors?

02:15:49.374 --> 02:15:52.366
Sir, haven't you left yet?
You were leaving in 5 minutes.

02:15:56.448 --> 02:15:57.312
What are you painting?

02:15:58.283 --> 02:16:00.252
lt's a frog, duck and a banana.

02:16:00.252 --> 02:16:02.277
ls it a frog?

02:17:45.557 --> 02:17:46.615
How's my painting?
Look at it.

02:17:49.227 --> 02:17:52.196
Absolutely beautiful sir.
First prize sir.

02:20:43.001 --> 02:20:45.469
Amazing!
What a wonderful morning.

02:20:46.971 --> 02:20:51.271
Going through the colored
glasses of windows we reached

02:20:51.409 --> 02:20:52.671
our childhood.

02:20:53.011 --> 02:20:54.569
Praise to be God's.

02:20:55.680 --> 02:20:57.477
l saw other's childhoods too.

02:21:00.285 --> 02:21:02.913
He will take compulsory
lessons from Nikum Sir.

02:21:03.221 --> 02:21:05.382
lsn't it Joy Sir?

02:21:08.326 --> 02:21:11.193
But not only me, Sen and Tiwari
Sir will too,

02:21:11.296 --> 02:21:13.924
these two had bad paintings as well.

02:21:16.501 --> 02:21:17.525
All right.

02:21:18.336 --> 02:21:21.464
By Nikum, l just remember.

02:21:21.573 --> 02:21:25.669
That we won't have to look
for a new art teacher.

02:21:26.244 --> 02:21:31.580
Nikum sir, along with Tulip School,
will also teach in our school.

02:21:44.295 --> 02:21:47.890
No, what you have been waiting for...

02:21:48.266 --> 02:21:49.665
l'm going to announce that.

02:21:50.969 --> 02:21:53.665
Let me come to the results
of the Art Fair.

02:21:54.506 --> 02:21:58.602
Our special guest Madam Lalita
was in a fix.

02:22:03.281 --> 02:22:10.210
lt was a tie. She wanted to award
both paintings to be the best.

02:22:10.555 --> 02:22:14.924
That wasn't possible.
Because the winner painting

02:22:16.261 --> 02:22:21.893
l thought that painting will become the
front cover of the school's yearbook.

02:22:22.734 --> 02:22:24.497
Now, there can't be two
front covers.

02:22:25.336 --> 02:22:28.305
So what to do now?

02:22:30.275 --> 02:22:32.539
Madam was in deep confusion.

02:22:33.244 --> 02:22:36.270
After thinking a lot she
came to a conclusion.

02:22:37.315 --> 02:22:41.649
She selected the student
leaving the teacher.

02:22:44.355 --> 02:22:45.515
Yes children.

02:22:45.623 --> 02:22:49.559
Your Nikum sir has been defeated.

02:22:52.964 --> 02:22:56.297
And the student who defeated him

02:22:57.402 --> 02:23:04.331
Little, 9 years old,
lshaan Nandkishore Awasti.

02:23:46.250 --> 02:23:47.410
Applause.

02:25:59.550 --> 02:26:03.452
Here's your lshaan
and here's his painting.

02:26:04.655 --> 02:26:06.589
Just look at it, what
a masterpiece.

02:26:07.425 --> 02:26:11.327
He's a very talented boy.
l'm really happy to have him.

02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:13.925
Have you met his teachers?

02:26:14.232 --> 02:26:15.199
No sir.

02:26:15.299 --> 02:26:17.893
Please go ahead and meet them,
they'll give the progress report.

02:26:44.228 --> 02:26:46.662
First we thought something was
wrong, he won't be staying here.

02:26:47.365 --> 02:26:51.267
But what improvement he made.

02:26:51.369 --> 02:26:55.965
What a pace to pick-up he has.
Wonderful. Here's his progress report.

02:27:06.951 --> 02:27:08.885
l can't believe all this.
Thank you.

02:27:38.983 --> 02:27:41.213
What?
What happened?

02:27:44.255 --> 02:27:46.883
l can't find words to
thank you.

02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:56.260
He's lovely boy.

02:27:56.367 --> 02:27:58.198
Just look after him.

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:30.497
