00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:42,041
<i>Listen up, SITs.</i>
<i>Our mission is Jacob Zellman.</i>

661
00:34:42,125 --> 00:34:44,958
<i>Five years old,</i>
<i>possibly with the Gift of Dreams.</i>

662
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:49,666
<i>We have three hours and five minutes</i>
<i>until his mom gets back</i>

663
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,041

<i>Hey, Berna, will you start the laser scan?</i>

667
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:01,541
<i>-On it.</i>
<i>-[bleep]</i>

668

<i>[whirring]</i>

669
00:35:03,458 --> 00:35:06,041
<i>[girl] All right. Let's take a look</i>
<i>in this Toadie's pouch.</i>

670
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:12,083
<i>What the heck? Is that half a duck?</i>

671
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:13,750
<i>[Kelly] It's a goose lamp.</i>

672
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:17,750
<i>-How big are their pouches?</i>
<i>-Who's the human?</i>

673
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:19,916
<i>This is Kelly.</i>

674
00:35:20,458 --> 00:35:22,291
<i>[girl] And why exactly is she here?</i>

675
00:35:22,375 --> 00:35:24,541
<i>She was with the kid when he got taken.</i>

676
00:35:24,625 --> 00:35:26,333
<i>-We need to pick her brain.</i>
<i>-But--</i>

677
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:28,250
<i>Just search the thing for clues.</i>

678
00:35:30,041 --> 00:35:32,041
<i>Rude. It's not a "thing."</i>

679
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:36,791
<i>It's a Monstria Chordata Amphibia</i>
<i>Carnivora of the Toadie subspecies.</i>

680
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:41,500
<i>-[sighs] Remove her.</i>
<i>-Cassie, this isn't your call.</i>

681
00:35:42,125 --> 00:35:43,875
<i>You're just a Sitter in Training.</i>

682
00:35:43,958 --> 00:35:46,625
<i>I mean, see this? And this?</i>

683
00:35:46,708 --> 00:35:48,000
<i>And this?</i>

684
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,625
<i>Chapter Vice President. Okay?</i>

685
00:35:51,208 --> 00:35:53,708
<i>It's gonna take me hours</i>
<i>to remove the items from its pouch.</i>

686
00:35:53,791 --> 00:35:55,166
<i>Better get to it, then.</i>

687
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,208
<i>-I'm so sorry. So sorry.</i>
<i>-[Liz] Follow me.</i>

688
00:35:58,708 --> 00:36:02,416
<i>Hey. So, this Jacob kid</i>
<i>really has the Gift of Dreams?</i>

689
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:04,333
<i>I--</i>

690
00:36:05,541 --> 00:36:07,541
<i>I just told her what Jacob told me.</i>

691
00:36:07,625 --> 00:36:09,916
<i>I don't even really know</i>
<i>what the Gift of Dreams is.</i>

692
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,708
<i>It's-- it's legendary.</i>

<i>to be able to bring dreams to life.</i>

<i>Or nightmares.</i>

<i>to protect kids like that.</i>

696
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:23,500

<i>Can you make</i>
<i>one of your memory potions?</i>

699
00:36:27,625 --> 00:36:32,083

<i>I have a passion for potions.</i>
