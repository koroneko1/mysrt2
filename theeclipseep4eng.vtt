00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:26.027
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:29.430
The protest video in our school is now on the internet.

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.731
People are tweeting about it.

00:00:30.848 --> 00:00:36.482
Do you realize how damaging this could be to our reputation?

00:00:36.482 --> 00:00:39.122
From now on, if you see students using their phones in school,

00:00:39.262 --> 00:00:40.283
take it from them.

00:00:42.916 --> 00:00:43.891
Got it?

00:00:44.047 --> 00:00:48.679
Then I’m gonna need to send them a sign saying their threat didn’t work.

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.704
It’s time we intensify our protest.

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:52.456
Fight!

00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:55.773
We demand the bad guys to be punished.

00:00:55.773 --> 00:00:57.501
If they don’t go themselves, move them.

00:01:01.987 --> 00:01:03.591
I attended the meeting in the city for a few hours.

00:01:03.591 --> 00:01:04.957
How did you let it happen?

00:01:04.957 --> 00:01:06.839
I will deal with this as soon as possible, sir.

00:01:06.839 --> 00:01:08.423
Give us one more chance, Teacher.

00:01:08.423 --> 00:01:09.786
What are you going to do?

00:01:10.001 --> 00:01:12.001
I’m going to find the evidence and expose him.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.495
Wait and see.

00:02:01.673 --> 00:02:05.467
I’m going to find the evidence and expose his plan to ruin our school.

00:02:05.652 --> 00:02:08.840
If I find it, he’ll be expelled.

00:02:09.153 --> 00:02:10.873
Where will you find it?

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.717
Aren’t you taking a shower?

00:02:41.812 --> 00:02:42.951
You go ahead.

00:02:43.307 --> 00:02:45.000
I’ll just cool down a bit more.

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:08.596
You want a problem?

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:11.547
You didn’t close your locker properly.

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:14.206
The notebook was falling. I just stored it for you.

00:03:14.346 --> 00:03:14.943
Yeah?

00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:17.865
Move. I’m going to take a shower.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.191
Hey!

00:03:35.517 --> 00:03:36.513
Why are you here?

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.450
Were you stealing my stuff there?

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:40.311
I said no.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.033
Get out.

00:03:42.127 --> 00:03:43.521
People might get the wrong idea if they see us.

00:03:43.887 --> 00:03:45.887
It’s normal for two male friends to take a shower together.

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:47.684
Haven’t you done it?

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.785
I do it with close friends only.

00:03:49.906 --> 00:03:51.021
You’re not.

00:03:51.021 --> 00:03:52.793
I don’t want to be close to dummies like you guys.

00:03:53.045 --> 00:03:54.101
Then get out.

00:03:54.777 --> 00:03:55.814
That’s my stuff.

00:04:28.726 --> 00:04:30.000
Get your stuff and go.

00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:32.128
Yes.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.491
I have received complaints from teachers and many students

00:05:54.106 --> 00:05:57.574
about the misbehaviors of the new student named Ayan.

00:05:59.374 --> 00:06:03.168
I knew this student was going to be reported one day.

00:06:04.731 --> 00:06:07.360
Is he the one who transferred from Parot School?

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.136
He is.

00:06:09.322 --> 00:06:12.254
He likes to raise troubling questions in class.

00:06:12.501 --> 00:06:14.664
I didn’t realize the other teachers are facing the same issue.

00:06:14.664 --> 00:06:15.351
Yes.

00:06:15.786 --> 00:06:17.204
We all are.

00:06:17.497 --> 00:06:19.404
I suppose it’s a trend for the new generation.

00:06:20.748 --> 00:06:26.196
You mean the trend of being arrogant, aggressive, inappropriately know-it-all?

00:06:26.196 --> 00:06:28.970
You speak our minds, Teacher Waree.

00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:32.876
What do you require us to do, Teacher Chadok?

00:06:35.134 --> 00:06:36.389
We are teachers.

00:06:36.764 --> 00:06:38.950
Of course, we need to give him some polishing.

00:06:40.348 --> 00:06:41.239
Right?

00:06:42.626 --> 00:06:45.000
For a student with high self-confidence like Ayan,

00:06:46.014 --> 00:06:47.851
we must show him that

00:06:48.103 --> 00:06:51.734
behind an able man, there are always other able men

00:06:57.876 --> 00:06:59.876
[The way of thinking of philosophers in the 18th century.]

00:07:00.881 --> 00:07:02.881
From what we studied,

00:07:03.682 --> 00:07:11.110
can anyone name any well-known philosophers in the 18th century?

00:07:11.855 --> 00:07:12.731
Ayan.

00:07:13.733 --> 00:07:14.537
Answer that.

00:07:23.181 --> 00:07:24.342
Thomas Hobbes.

00:07:25.173 --> 00:07:26.497
What’s his ideal?

00:07:29.062 --> 00:07:31.831
You only know the name. You didn’t really study.

00:07:38.158 --> 00:07:41.719
Every human has the liberty and the freedom to engage in any activity

00:07:42.574 --> 00:07:44.481
that produces disorder.

00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:48.092
Therefore, they agree to find themselves the ruler

00:07:49.056 --> 00:07:51.778
in order to bring peace to society.

00:07:53.841 --> 00:08:00.000
Which means there must be the ruler and those who are ruled.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.140
That’s the nature of society.

00:08:02.769 --> 00:08:03.744
Sit down.

00:08:06.164 --> 00:08:07.838
Sit back down. Why are you standing?

00:08:08.157 --> 00:08:15.189
But the ruler in Hobbes’s opinion must come from the power that is given by the people.

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.659
Not by force.

00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:21.850
I didn’t ask.

00:08:24.486 --> 00:08:26.486
If you want to answer that much,

00:08:27.493 --> 00:08:29.866
tell me what Montesquieu’s principle is.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.815
The separation of powers into three branches,

00:08:33.824 --> 00:08:37.789
The Legislative Branch, the Executive Branch, and the Judicial Branch.

00:08:37.789 --> 00:08:38.875
What about John Locke?

00:08:41.941 --> 00:08:43.289
You can’t answer it.

00:08:50.923 --> 00:08:56.999
Freedom and liberty are fundamental human rights that all humans are born with.

00:08:58.017 --> 00:08:59.551
That’s his ideal.

00:09:04.222 --> 00:09:06.222
You’re interesting, Ayan.

00:09:08.864 --> 00:09:14.288
Having a student like you in class makes the class a lot livelier.

00:09:15.395 --> 00:09:18.420
I guess we need to do questions and answers like this more often.

00:09:22.565 --> 00:09:26.894
What are the synonyms of the word ‘Phra Arthit?’ (The sun)

00:09:27.432 --> 00:09:28.357
Ayan.

00:09:29.825 --> 00:09:33.881
Suriya, Tinakorn, Tiwakorn.

00:09:33.881 --> 00:09:36.308
And the synonyms of ‘The moon?’

00:09:36.607 --> 00:09:38.141
Ayan, answer it.

00:09:38.506 --> 00:09:43.185
Is substance X's boiling point higher than that of substances Y and Z?

00:09:44.235 --> 00:09:45.163
Yes, it is.

00:09:45.668 --> 00:09:48.483
And why is substance X soluble in water?

00:09:50.001 --> 00:09:51.121
Can I answer that?

00:09:52.985 --> 00:09:54.377
So, Ayan?

00:09:57.869 --> 00:10:00.000
The teachers were so harsh on Aye today.

00:10:00.401 --> 00:10:01.376
Right.

00:10:02.394 --> 00:10:03.835
I laughed at first.

00:10:04.037 --> 00:10:06.153
He’s so cocky. I thought he deserved it.

00:10:07.494 --> 00:10:09.564
But the old lads wouldn’t stop.

00:10:09.955 --> 00:10:11.769
Now I feel guilty I laughed.

00:10:12.484 --> 00:10:17.815
Do you think someone is behind this hardship on Aye?

00:10:23.099 --> 00:10:24.074
I don’t know.

00:10:25.814 --> 00:10:27.604
You guys go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.

00:10:28.443 --> 00:10:29.164
Yeah.

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:35.334
Hi, Akk.

00:10:35.683 --> 00:10:36.719
Hello, sir.

00:10:42.969 --> 00:10:44.689
I’d like to ask you a question, sir.

00:10:45.341 --> 00:10:46.163
What is it?

00:10:48.447 --> 00:10:51.868
Do you know about Ayan being tested in class by all the teachers?

00:10:58.412 --> 00:10:59.470
You do?

00:11:00.436 --> 00:11:02.100
We’re giving him a chance.

00:11:02.988 --> 00:11:04.212
If he can adjust,

00:11:04.988 --> 00:11:07.255
he will be one of the Suppalos completely.

00:11:08.146 --> 00:11:09.093
If not,

00:11:09.745 --> 00:11:12.312
then he will know he doesn't belong here.

00:11:13.124 --> 00:11:13.752
But…

00:11:13.752 --> 00:11:14.775
Why but, Akk?

00:11:16.045 --> 00:11:16.973
What’s the matter with you?

00:11:18.957 --> 00:11:20.957
Or you’ve been brainwashed by Ayan too?

00:11:23.544 --> 00:11:24.468
No, sir.

00:11:25.097 --> 00:11:25.893
Akk.

00:11:26.812 --> 00:11:29.348
We have Suppalo guidelines and rules to follow.

00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:30.825
Keep that in mind.

00:11:34.109 --> 00:11:34.889
Yes, sir.

00:11:46.638 --> 00:11:48.079
Are you so in love with me?

00:11:48.522 --> 00:11:49.889
You keep staring at my face.

00:11:51.636 --> 00:11:52.688
Nonsense.

00:11:52.813 --> 00:11:54.014
You knew about it, didn’t you?

00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:54.929
About what?

00:11:55.524 --> 00:11:57.314
About the teachers picking on me.

00:11:58.411 --> 00:11:59.464
Aye.

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:02.391
I have no clue what you’re doing.

00:12:02.956 --> 00:12:04.061
But if I were you,

00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:06.284
I’d stop.

00:12:12.099 --> 00:12:13.540
- Or…
- I won’t stop.

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:01.011
Ayan.

00:13:02.679 --> 00:13:03.363
Answer it.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:14.694
You do know?

00:13:15.717 --> 00:13:17.205
We’re giving him a chance.

00:13:18.363 --> 00:13:19.555
If he can adjust,

00:13:20.255 --> 00:13:22.408
he will be one of the Suppalos completely.

00:13:23.379 --> 00:13:24.250
If not,

00:13:24.914 --> 00:13:27.586
then he will know he doesn't belong here.

00:13:55.302 --> 00:13:56.634
Are you so in love with me?

00:13:58.679 --> 00:14:00.190
You keep staring at my face.

00:14:01.768 --> 00:14:02.692
Nonsense.

00:14:22.635 --> 00:14:23.890
You knew about it, didn’t you?

00:14:26.186 --> 00:14:26.931
About what?

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:30.490
About the teachers picking on me.

00:14:36.271 --> 00:14:37.391
How would I know?

00:14:41.553 --> 00:14:42.182
Yeah?

00:14:46.964 --> 00:14:48.354
This is not you at all.

00:14:50.681 --> 00:14:52.394
You normally don’t yield easily.

00:14:53.858 --> 00:14:55.858
Why did you let them do that much to you?

00:15:03.372 --> 00:15:05.157
It’s the only way to know

00:15:07.716 --> 00:15:11.761
how your school dealt with someone who disagreed.

00:15:14.085 --> 00:15:15.115
Who are you talking about?

00:15:15.994 --> 00:15:17.323
Who did this school deal with?

00:15:19.099 --> 00:15:19.849
No one.

00:15:20.405 --> 00:15:21.583
I’m just saying.

00:15:22.325 --> 00:15:23.244
Tell me.

00:15:23.603 --> 00:15:24.558
Stop talking.

00:15:25.141 --> 00:15:25.975
I’m tired.

00:16:21.663 --> 00:16:23.807
You won’t be so mean to me too, right?

00:17:04.217 --> 00:17:07.114
(I don’t want it anymore. You take it.)

00:17:29.462 --> 00:17:30.377
Yes, Mom.

00:17:31.758 --> 00:17:32.843
Yes.

00:17:34.145 --> 00:17:35.124
Sure.

00:17:38.012 --> 00:17:38.674
Hey.

00:17:40.218 --> 00:17:41.080
Are you okay there?

00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:43.007
Still in school?

00:17:45.447 --> 00:17:46.079
Yeah.

00:17:47.895 --> 00:17:48.947
Your mom isn’t picking you up?

00:17:49.449 --> 00:17:50.397
You want a lift?

00:17:50.848 --> 00:17:51.606
It’s okay.

00:17:52.324 --> 00:17:53.907
She has to run an errand.

00:17:54.247 --> 00:17:55.229
My dad will come instead.

00:17:56.126 --> 00:17:57.144
Oh!

00:17:57.589 --> 00:17:59.750
Your dad who’s an alumnus here as those guys said?

00:18:01.347 --> 00:18:01.933
Um.

00:18:03.003 --> 00:18:05.362
He wanted me to go here, like him.

00:18:11.509 --> 00:18:12.407
Are you okay?

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:14.442
I am.

00:18:15.564 --> 00:18:17.080
Are you though?

00:18:18.075 --> 00:18:19.217
Tough day today.

00:18:22.107 --> 00:18:23.318
Pretty tough.

00:18:23.910 --> 00:18:25.051
But I’m…

00:18:27.293 --> 00:18:28.152
okay now.

00:18:32.625 --> 00:18:33.514
Aye.

00:18:35.756 --> 00:18:38.302
I have no clue what you’re doing.

00:18:38.975 --> 00:18:40.077
But if I were you,

00:18:41.458 --> 00:18:42.356
I’d stop.

00:18:48.258 --> 00:18:49.522
- Or…
- I won’t stop.

00:18:52.661 --> 00:18:53.319
Fine.

00:18:54.772 --> 00:18:56.527
Be careful then.

00:18:58.166 --> 00:18:58.876
Bye now.

00:19:00.166 --> 00:19:01.043
Thua.

00:19:02.604 --> 00:19:03.942
Don’t forget our appointment this Sat.

00:19:06.238 --> 00:19:06.900
Um.

00:19:12.678 --> 00:19:14.606
Why am I even doing this?

00:19:14.834 --> 00:19:17.229
Just do it. It’s one way to help our school.

00:19:23.314 --> 00:19:24.188
Follow him.

00:19:24.654 --> 00:19:25.780
Who do you think he’s meeting?

00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:27.311
The World Remembers gang?

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:30.568
Maybe he’s afraid of being watched in school.

00:19:31.114 --> 00:19:32.396
That’s why he’s meeting them outside.

00:19:33.252 --> 00:19:35.252
I think they’re planning the next protest.

00:19:35.686 --> 00:19:38.816
Planning the protest in a coffee shop?

00:19:39.506 --> 00:19:40.640
Isn’t it weird?

00:19:42.129 --> 00:19:43.533
Maybe he’s meeting his lover.

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:08.039
Without those protesters, this place looks like a school again.
[STUDENT PREFECT CLUB]

00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:12.052
They were threatened and punished by Teacher Chadok.

00:20:12.052 --> 00:20:13.077
I think they’ve learned the lesson now.

00:20:15.463 --> 00:20:19.045
If nobody messes with their heads again, things should be peaceful.

00:20:20.231 --> 00:20:21.295
No one will.

00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:23.428
Ayan was done pretty bad.

00:20:25.631 --> 00:20:26.886
But let me guess.

00:20:27.585 --> 00:20:29.359
The gang was dealt with already.

00:20:29.764 --> 00:20:32.487
The teachers’ next target should be Aye.

00:20:33.497 --> 00:20:35.203
That method won't work.

00:20:37.943 --> 00:20:39.016
Why did you hit the table?

00:20:40.416 --> 00:20:41.840
What method do you suggest?

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:44.777
I don’t know yet.

00:20:45.343 --> 00:20:49.511
But if we know why he joined this school, we might know how to handle him.

00:20:55.358 --> 00:20:56.127
I know it.

00:20:56.759 --> 00:20:59.300
We found nothing because we only follow him inside school.

00:20:59.517 --> 00:21:01.285
What if we follow him outside school?

00:21:04.373 --> 00:21:06.283
Like when you went to his house yesterday?

00:21:06.599 --> 00:21:07.309
Yes.

00:21:07.586 --> 00:21:10.467
But we’re following him every day, weekdays and weekends.

00:21:10.619 --> 00:21:11.668
What about public holidays?

00:21:11.965 --> 00:21:12.826
That too.

00:21:15.994 --> 00:21:17.429
Are you guys free this weekend?

00:21:18.928 --> 00:21:22.396
I have the Indie Movie Festival to get to.

00:21:22.396 --> 00:21:23.534
I already bought the ticket.

00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:24.846
Sorry, man.

00:21:25.085 --> 00:21:26.340
You got away with it.

00:21:27.625 --> 00:21:29.444
It’s down to you now, Kan.

00:21:32.536 --> 00:21:34.852
Don’t look at me. I have tutoring classes.

00:21:36.536 --> 00:21:37.971
Are you my friend, Kan?

00:21:40.237 --> 00:21:42.205
Don’t drag our friendship into this.

00:21:42.979 --> 00:21:44.482
I really do have extra school.

00:21:44.726 --> 00:21:46.232
I need to take care of the girls as well.

00:21:46.345 --> 00:21:47.093
Please.

00:21:47.626 --> 00:21:49.626
Kan, my dear friend.

00:21:52.043 --> 00:21:53.049
Wat, my beloved friend.

00:22:12.356 --> 00:22:13.061
Yes, Mom.

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.395
How are you doing, Aye?

00:22:16.612 --> 00:22:17.440
Good.

00:22:18.953 --> 00:22:19.967
What is it?

00:22:20.639 --> 00:22:25.165
I saw the news about the protest in your school.

00:22:25.165 --> 00:22:28.750
People won’t stop sharing about it in the parents' group chat.

00:22:29.063 --> 00:22:31.063
You don’t take any part in it, do you?

00:22:31.063 --> 00:22:33.860
The protest happened before I joined.

00:22:34.970 --> 00:22:36.405
Because the system is broken.

00:22:37.615 --> 00:22:41.421
Without me, this thing will happen eventually.

00:22:41.421 --> 00:22:42.107
Aye,

00:22:42.404 --> 00:22:44.404
I think this is too risky.

00:22:45.396 --> 00:22:46.538
Stop it.

00:22:46.763 --> 00:22:49.102
Don’t get involved with it anymore. Let it go.

00:22:49.630 --> 00:22:50.475
No.

00:22:51.085 --> 00:22:53.053
I won’t let Uncle Di die for nothing.

00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.965
Why am I even doing this?

00:23:09.154 --> 00:23:11.673
Just do it. It’s one way to help our school.

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.445
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

00:23:15.645 --> 00:23:16.919
There. He’s leaving.

00:23:26.912 --> 00:23:27.881
Follow him.

00:23:28.912 --> 00:23:29.943
Come on. We might lose him.

00:23:29.943 --> 00:23:30.966
I know.

00:23:53.545 --> 00:23:54.653
Who do you think he’s meeting?

00:23:54.788 --> 00:23:56.011
The World Remembers gang?

00:23:57.953 --> 00:24:00.179
Maybe he’s afraid of being watched in school.

00:24:00.656 --> 00:24:01.933
That’s why he’s meeting them outside.

00:24:05.023 --> 00:24:07.023
I think they’re planning the next protest.

00:24:08.652 --> 00:24:11.804
Planning the protest in a coffee shop?

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.503
Isn’t it weird?

00:24:15.085 --> 00:24:16.276
Maybe he’s meeting his lover.

00:24:18.197 --> 00:24:19.289
I’m curious now.

00:24:20.689 --> 00:24:21.597
Let’s go.

00:24:21.894 --> 00:24:22.629
All right.

00:24:26.869 --> 00:24:29.569
Welcome to Café for All.

00:24:29.569 --> 00:24:30.793
Hi, Aye.

00:24:30.886 --> 00:24:31.946
Welcome.

00:24:31.946 --> 00:24:32.886
Hello, Golf.

00:24:32.886 --> 00:24:33.735
Hello.

00:24:34.229 --> 00:24:35.777
The ones you’re meeting are here.

00:24:37.443 --> 00:24:37.948
Alright.

00:24:37.948 --> 00:24:39.014
Thank you, Golf.

00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:41.713
Hi, Mom.

00:24:41.713 --> 00:24:42.579
Hi

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.105
Did I keep you waiting?

00:24:44.105 --> 00:24:45.051
Not at all.

00:24:47.888 --> 00:24:49.617
Welcome.

00:24:52.972 --> 00:24:55.725
Welcome to the café of diversity.

00:24:56.453 --> 00:24:57.181
Yes.

00:24:57.416 --> 00:24:58.693
That’s a long name.

00:24:59.279 --> 00:25:00.630
Your first time here, isn’t it?

00:25:01.104 --> 00:25:01.753
Yes.

00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:03.199
It is.

00:25:03.605 --> 00:25:06.462
The first time is usually exciting.

00:25:06.462 --> 00:25:07.216
It’s normal.

00:25:07.421 --> 00:25:09.125
You can go pick your seats.

00:25:09.125 --> 00:25:11.885
And the staff will take your orders shortly.

00:25:12.156 --> 00:25:13.039
Sure.

00:25:13.174 --> 00:25:13.884
Please.

00:25:14.186 --> 00:25:15.270
Thank you.

00:25:18.525 --> 00:25:19.283
Wow!

00:25:19.954 --> 00:25:21.954
It is indeed the café of diversity.

00:25:23.148 --> 00:25:23.870
Right.

00:25:24.254 --> 00:25:24.943
Hey,

00:25:25.532 --> 00:25:27.837
if we stay on, will we be stereotyped too?

00:25:28.552 --> 00:25:29.510
Let’s leave.

00:25:29.805 --> 00:25:31.637
Kan, hold on.

00:25:32.169 --> 00:25:35.230
If you leave now, you won’t know who Ayan is meeting.

00:25:37.601 --> 00:25:38.446
Come on.

00:25:42.826 --> 00:25:43.596
There.

00:25:46.102 --> 00:25:46.993
Thua.

00:25:47.599 --> 00:25:48.696
Hide.

00:25:56.355 --> 00:25:58.265
The café is really cute.

00:25:58.265 --> 00:26:00.516
It’s so comfortable in here.

00:26:03.183 --> 00:26:04.189
It is, Mom.

00:26:04.372 --> 00:26:06.372
Glad you and Thuaphu like it.

00:26:07.925 --> 00:26:10.845
How are you doing in the new school?

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:12.024
Must be quite tough to adjust.

00:26:13.627 --> 00:26:14.974
Not at all.

00:26:16.356 --> 00:26:19.485
Thuaphu helps a lot.

00:26:21.556 --> 00:26:24.233
Thuaphu is always a helper.

00:26:25.252 --> 00:26:26.913
He really is a great man, Mom.

00:26:30.277 --> 00:26:32.819
But he likes to keep what he feels inside

00:26:34.046 --> 00:26:36.543
just to make other people comfortable.

00:26:38.372 --> 00:26:39.158
Aye.

00:26:42.621 --> 00:26:44.802
And he’s playing a hero.

00:26:44.802 --> 00:26:45.519
Kan,

00:26:46.176 --> 00:26:47.113
be quiet.

00:26:47.632 --> 00:26:48.605
Thua,

00:26:49.602 --> 00:26:51.444
whatever you think or feel,

00:26:53.214 --> 00:26:54.446
you can talk to your mom.

00:27:00.019 --> 00:27:01.409
Is it about Dad?

00:27:03.869 --> 00:27:05.205
No, Mom.

00:27:05.642 --> 00:27:07.077
It’s nothing.

00:27:07.876 --> 00:27:09.582
Aye is just rambling.

00:27:12.836 --> 00:27:14.376
Ever since I remarried,

00:27:15.234 --> 00:27:18.444
I’ve never seen you express any feelings.

00:27:19.018 --> 00:27:19.914
I thought…

00:27:21.018 --> 00:27:23.138
nothing was wrong.

00:27:23.847 --> 00:27:25.576
Nothing is wrong, Mom.

00:27:26.731 --> 00:27:27.773
Dad is…

00:27:30.437 --> 00:27:31.395
nice to me.

00:27:33.519 --> 00:27:36.693
But…it’s his method, isn’t it?

00:27:38.823 --> 00:27:41.162
He is so different from your real dad, isn’t he?

00:27:45.580 --> 00:27:48.867
I know my son is patient and strong.

00:27:54.388 --> 00:27:57.923
But you have the right to express your feelings.

00:28:01.898 --> 00:28:04.124
No matter how busy I am,

00:28:08.209 --> 00:28:09.929
if it’s about you,

00:28:11.194 --> 00:28:13.190
I will always listen.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:15.650
Do you understand?

00:28:15.921 --> 00:28:16.628
I do.

00:28:20.255 --> 00:28:21.487
Thank you, Aye,

00:28:22.028 --> 00:28:24.028
for finding a way to tell me about this.

00:28:25.586 --> 00:28:26.248
Of course.

00:28:28.181 --> 00:28:31.485
I’m so sorry if I crossed the line.

00:28:34.494 --> 00:28:35.532
It’s totally okay.

00:28:36.322 --> 00:28:39.136
I know you meant well to Thuaphu.

00:28:46.291 --> 00:28:49.917
Should I cancel my appointment so that we can continue chatting?

00:28:50.727 --> 00:28:52.072
Please don’t.

00:28:52.072 --> 00:28:53.440
You’ve got work to do.

00:28:53.798 --> 00:28:56.205
We can continue this at home.

00:28:58.236 --> 00:28:59.396
Are you sure?

00:29:03.054 --> 00:29:04.436
Please look after him.

00:29:05.610 --> 00:29:06.431
Of course.

00:29:12.723 --> 00:29:14.723
Thua must have felt very uneasy.

00:29:16.178 --> 00:29:16.939
Right.

00:29:19.016 --> 00:29:20.865
Did he tell you anything at all?

00:29:33.002 --> 00:29:33.960
Are you okay?

00:29:34.908 --> 00:29:36.311
I am.

00:29:38.529 --> 00:29:41.613
I thought it was going to be the end of the world at first.

00:29:43.666 --> 00:29:45.350
I’m so relieved now.

00:29:51.281 --> 00:29:52.063
Drink up.

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:53.685
They serve really good stuff here.

00:29:54.183 --> 00:29:55.015
Agree.

00:29:55.196 --> 00:29:56.206
Really good.

00:29:59.821 --> 00:30:00.694
Do you come here a lot?

00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.466
Yes.

00:30:09.902 --> 00:30:14.115
Someone close to me used to take me here a lot.

00:30:16.089 --> 00:30:17.110
Used to?

00:30:18.089 --> 00:30:20.762
You guys aren’t close anymore?

00:30:29.141 --> 00:30:30.085
He’s dead.

00:30:32.637 --> 00:30:33.693
I’m sorry.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.476
It’s fine.

00:30:40.175 --> 00:30:42.005
Are you going anywhere after this?

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:47.404
Yes.

00:30:54.229 --> 00:30:55.263
Teacher.

00:30:56.229 --> 00:30:57.579
May I please talk to you?

00:30:58.321 --> 00:30:59.244
About what?

00:31:01.032 --> 00:31:02.405
About Ayan.

00:31:04.015 --> 00:31:04.778
Hey.

00:31:06.015 --> 00:31:07.645
What did you just say to Aunt Waree?

00:31:07.834 --> 00:31:09.165
Are you following me?

00:31:09.336 --> 00:31:12.085
Just like when you and Kan were following me on Saturday,

00:31:12.306 --> 00:31:13.095
You’re wrong.

00:31:13.389 --> 00:31:14.374
I didn’t follow you.

00:31:15.086 --> 00:31:15.910
Hey.

00:31:16.452 --> 00:31:17.628
Just confess already.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.143
Hey, look out!

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:15.737
Remember this, Aye.

00:33:16.510 --> 00:33:17.839
You’re special.

00:33:18.928 --> 00:33:20.928
Don’t even think you have no one.

00:33:22.203 --> 00:33:23.671
You'll always have me.

00:34:03.813 --> 00:34:04.894
Thua.

00:34:06.176 --> 00:34:07.095
Hey, Kan.

00:34:08.185 --> 00:34:09.774
You skipped class too?

00:34:10.737 --> 00:34:11.536
Yeah.

00:34:11.754 --> 00:34:12.955
Just one day.

00:34:15.315 --> 00:34:16.367
Are you here by yourself?

00:34:17.745 --> 00:34:18.693
I came with my mom.

00:34:19.028 --> 00:34:21.028
But she already left for work.

00:34:26.530 --> 00:34:27.116
Come on.

00:34:28.132 --> 00:34:29.038
Let’s go for a walk.

00:34:31.214 --> 00:34:31.953
Yeah.

00:34:37.728 --> 00:34:38.351
Hey.

00:34:38.351 --> 00:34:39.172
What?

00:34:39.796 --> 00:34:40.714
Let’s have some ice cream.

00:34:42.286 --> 00:34:43.102
Ice cream?

00:34:44.527 --> 00:34:45.680
Why are you in the mood?

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.808
Oh, just come.

00:34:54.327 --> 00:34:55.598
Are you still mad at me?

00:34:57.702 --> 00:34:58.812
I’m not mad at you.

00:35:01.434 --> 00:35:03.168
Then why don’t you talk to me these days?

00:35:03.536 --> 00:35:06.020
Because you’re uncomfortable when I’m around.

00:35:06.979 --> 00:35:07.652
I…

00:35:07.652 --> 00:35:08.544
I get it.

00:35:11.619 --> 00:35:15.553
You don’t like people to judge you just like when they judge me.

00:35:28.663 --> 00:35:29.384
Thua.

00:35:30.182 --> 00:35:30.881
Yeah?

00:35:32.012 --> 00:35:35.076
Whatever problem you have, you can always talk to me.

00:35:49.222 --> 00:35:50.666
Damn it! It’s melting.

00:35:51.425 --> 00:35:52.418
You should eat fast.

00:35:54.473 --> 00:35:55.480
Do it.

00:35:55.735 --> 00:35:57.928
Whoa! I can’t stop it now.

00:35:59.261 --> 00:36:00.971
Here. Let me wipe it.

00:36:11.042 --> 00:36:12.018
Damn.

00:36:14.863 --> 00:36:17.773
My mom said my dad still complains about me skipping extra school.

00:36:18.655 --> 00:36:20.099
They’re just complaining.

00:36:20.513 --> 00:36:22.054
They love you so much anyway.

00:36:22.170 --> 00:36:23.711
That’s why they spoil you like this.

00:36:34.146 --> 00:36:36.896
Do you think Thua and Aye are so close?

00:36:39.255 --> 00:36:40.481
How would I know?

00:36:44.161 --> 00:36:46.379
You followed Aye today. What did you get?

00:36:46.647 --> 00:36:47.934
Did he meet up with The World Remembers?

00:36:51.029 --> 00:36:51.911
No.

00:36:52.635 --> 00:36:54.079
He didn’t meet anyone.

00:36:54.413 --> 00:36:57.283
He just placed a white rose at the edge of the cliff.

00:36:58.345 --> 00:36:59.220
Why?

00:37:01.251 --> 00:37:02.376
I don’t know.

00:37:03.265 --> 00:37:05.265
Does a white rose ring any bell though?

00:37:13.622 --> 00:37:14.939
- Teacher Dika.
- Teacher Dika.

00:37:15.858 --> 00:37:17.508
I remember now.

00:37:17.825 --> 00:37:19.656
Teacher Dika likes white roses.

00:37:19.656 --> 00:37:21.849
I saw him have the white rose pot behind his desk until…

00:37:21.849 --> 00:37:23.647
Until he moved to Parot school.

00:37:28.995 --> 00:37:31.986
How are Aye and Teacher Dika connected?

00:37:34.025 --> 00:37:36.388
I used to think they were dating.

00:37:36.599 --> 00:37:38.986
And Aye joined our school to get revenge for his boyfriend.

00:37:40.782 --> 00:37:42.516
You’ve been watching too many soap operas, Akk?

00:37:42.983 --> 00:37:44.668
That plot is really crappy.

00:37:45.882 --> 00:37:46.770
Hold on.

00:37:48.148 --> 00:37:51.339
What if Teacher Dika was the one who took him to the café?

00:37:55.465 --> 00:37:57.707
But Aye said that person was dead.

00:37:59.617 --> 00:38:00.506
Right.

00:38:25.672 --> 00:38:26.608
Teacher.

00:38:33.229 --> 00:38:34.453
May I please talk to you?

00:38:35.033 --> 00:38:35.809
About what?

00:38:39.801 --> 00:38:41.245
About Ayan.

00:38:45.109 --> 00:38:47.351
He’s been behaving lately.

00:38:49.562 --> 00:38:52.457
May I please ask you to stop punishing him like that?

00:38:53.346 --> 00:38:54.403
What did you say?

00:38:55.680 --> 00:39:01.234
I’d like to ask if The Prefect Club can watch his behavior instead.

00:39:01.621 --> 00:39:02.464
Can we?

00:39:06.063 --> 00:39:09.248
Actually, I don’t want to punish Ayan that badly.

00:39:11.785 --> 00:39:14.148
Are you sure you can have him under control?

00:39:15.309 --> 00:39:16.134
I am.

00:39:16.645 --> 00:39:17.775
I must do it.

00:39:22.003 --> 00:39:23.183
He’s your duty then.

00:39:24.706 --> 00:39:25.961
Thank you, ma’am.

00:39:40.241 --> 00:39:40.879
Hey.

00:39:42.112 --> 00:39:43.812
What did you just say to Aunt Waree?

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.538
Are you following me?

00:39:47.727 --> 00:39:50.573
Just like when you and Kan were following me on Saturday,

00:39:51.157 --> 00:39:52.550
student prefect.

00:39:54.025 --> 00:39:54.825
You’re wrong.

00:39:54.922 --> 00:39:55.857
I didn’t follow you.

00:39:56.686 --> 00:39:57.543
Hey.

00:39:58.075 --> 00:39:59.266
Just confess already.

00:40:02.442 --> 00:40:03.812
Hey, look out!

00:40:23.170 --> 00:40:24.275
Aren’t you gonna let me go?

00:40:27.563 --> 00:40:28.812
You want to hug me?

00:40:31.506 --> 00:40:33.337
I just pulled you away from that bike.

00:40:33.478 --> 00:40:34.763
I didn’t want to hug you.

00:40:35.609 --> 00:40:36.590
Sure about that?

00:40:37.104 --> 00:40:37.964
Damn you.

00:40:37.964 --> 00:40:39.563
If you’re not thanking me for my help,

00:40:39.879 --> 00:40:41.275
stop talking.

00:40:43.729 --> 00:40:44.571
Come here then.

00:40:45.729 --> 00:40:46.500
To where?

00:40:46.669 --> 00:40:47.462
Just come.

00:40:47.462 --> 00:40:48.812
Where? I’m making rounds.

00:40:48.812 --> 00:40:49.940
Come on.

00:40:50.527 --> 00:40:51.462
Let’s go, Akk.

00:40:52.187 --> 00:40:53.252
I can walk myself.

00:41:16.008 --> 00:41:16.859
Don’t.

00:41:17.391 --> 00:41:18.540
I can do it myself.

00:41:20.577 --> 00:41:22.093
You get used to being my car really fast.

00:41:22.602 --> 00:41:23.729
Used to, my ass.

00:41:25.276 --> 00:41:26.657
It’s just buckling up.

00:41:33.391 --> 00:41:34.400
Where are you taking me?

00:41:35.512 --> 00:41:36.503
What are we doing?

00:41:36.565 --> 00:41:37.482
Is it far?

00:41:37.482 --> 00:41:38.565
What time will we come back?

00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:55.804
We’re here.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:58.154
What are we doing here?

00:42:01.094 --> 00:42:02.165
I want a coffee.

00:42:02.407 --> 00:42:03.554
Go get it then.

00:42:03.812 --> 00:42:04.869
I’ll wait in the car.

00:42:05.256 --> 00:42:06.199
You can’t.

00:42:06.738 --> 00:42:08.375
Of course, I can. Why can’t I?

00:42:45.449 --> 00:42:47.086
What the hell are you doing?

00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:03.812
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

00:43:04.727 --> 00:43:07.428
In my opinion, you’re not fit for that.

00:43:07.428 --> 00:43:09.626
Someone born with privileges like you won’t understand.

00:43:09.626 --> 00:43:13.235
If we let the conflict go bigger, I’m afraid we will eventually fight each other.

00:43:15.938 --> 00:43:17.213
What is it, Akk?

00:43:17.213 --> 00:43:18.600
Isn’t Teacher Chadok here?

00:43:18.716 --> 00:43:21.296
Is the student prefect title that important to you?

00:43:21.296 --> 00:43:22.635
It allows me to help this school.

00:43:22.725 --> 00:43:26.079
You’re being tamed just to get the reward from those people?

00:43:26.079 --> 00:43:29.557
Is it so wrong if I try hard to get the privileges that other people do?

00:43:29.557 --> 00:43:30.589
You faggies!

00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:31.603
So?

00:43:31.603 --> 00:43:34.780
So what if we are? Are you hurt?

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:37.145
Men won’t think too much, Thuaphu.

00:43:37.245 --> 00:43:39.825
You’re girlish. That’s why you’re always bullied.

00:43:40.278 --> 00:43:43.342
If the curse is back, they might stop.

00:43:44.032 --> 00:43:45.403
Let’s not stop fighting.

00:43:45.403 --> 00:43:49.635
We will make this school consider changing its obsolete rules.

00:43:49.635 --> 00:43:51.694
I will expose what this shitty school did.

00:43:51.694 --> 00:43:52.897
I told you to stop!

00:43:52.897 --> 00:43:53.972
Stop!

00:43:56.269 --> 00:43:57.979
What is it?

00:43:57.979 --> 00:44:00.279
I’m afraid Aye would talk you into joining that gang.

00:44:02.309 --> 00:44:05.518
In my opinion, you are fit for this more.
