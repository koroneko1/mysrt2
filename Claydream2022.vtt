characters often have a simple

01:17.745 --> 01:21.149
goal and a simple purpose,

01:21.215 --> 01:23.451
but it's in
great conflict with

01:23.484 --> 01:27.155
either the world around
him, with other people.

01:27.155 --> 01:31.492
One could say that the story
makes the character or the

01:31.559 --> 01:35.163
character makes the story.

and nothing but the truth

01:44.505 --> 01:45.439

01:45.473 --> 01:47.675
-I do.

01:47.741 --> 01:48.909
-[man] Good morning, Mr. Vinton.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.444
-Good morning.

01:50.478 --> 01:54.315
-[man] Are you aware that
you have sued Mr. Knight for

01:54.348 --> 01:56.750
$3,000,000?

01:56.784 --> 01:59.453
-Yes.
There were extraordinarily

01:59.487 --> 02:02.590
strange happenings

02:02.656 --> 02:06.093
and amazing
manipulation

02:06.194 --> 02:09.897
led by -- without
question -- led by Phil Knight,

02:09.930 --> 02:13.667
who had other
motives for the company.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.773
-Yeah.

02:19.840 --> 02:23.777
-It still remains to me stunning
really that the founder of the

02:23.844 --> 02:28.716
company could basically ignore
the interests of shareholders

02:28.749 --> 02:31.952
other than Will Vinton or
myself -- the employees,

02:32.019 --> 02:35.223
the creditors -- ignore all
their interests and put this

02:35.223 --> 02:37.458
company on the
threshold of bankruptcy

02:37.525 --> 02:39.227
for no logical reason.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.028
-[Vinton] No,
that's not correct.

02:41.061 --> 02:45.466
It's definitely,
absolutely the other way around.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.822
***

04:14.855 --> 04:16.857
I never really had much
interest in film production

04:16.924 --> 04:19.827
until I actually went to
college and became very,

04:19.860 --> 04:22.162
very interested in it.

04:22.195 --> 04:26.700
My sister, who was in Berkeley,
strongly encouraged me to be a

04:26.767 --> 04:30.504
part of this scene that
was Berkeley in the '60s.

04:32.139 --> 04:34.608
There was just so much going on.

04:34.642 --> 04:38.346
*psychedelic rock

04:44.552 --> 04:46.687
The whole Claymation
thing really evolved

04:46.720 --> 04:49.523
out of studying architecture.

04:49.790 --> 04:53.727
I was very fascinated with
Antoni GaudÃ­ who had done

04:53.794 --> 04:57.798
extraordinarily organic
shapes in architecture,

04:57.831 --> 05:00.734
things that had to be sculpted.

05:00.768 --> 05:04.204
And that got me messing
with plasticine clay,

05:04.237 --> 05:07.708
and the filmmaking and the
clay got together and-- for some

05:07.741 --> 05:10.110
early experiments.

05:10.143 --> 05:13.947
My father used to shoot
16mm film as home movie.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.984
I asked him if I
could use his camera,

05:17.050 --> 05:20.388
so I got this great little
filmmaker kit and kind of

05:20.421 --> 05:23.757
instantly became a filmmaker.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.259
My father was really
hoping I would be,

05:26.293 --> 05:28.796
you know, a corporate
executive or something,

05:28.829 --> 05:32.065
but he also really encouraged me
to explore and try things and,

05:32.099 --> 05:33.634
you know, give it a go.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.469
And if you believe in
something strong enough,

05:35.503 --> 05:37.971
you'll find a way
to make it happen.

05:38.906 --> 05:41.174
So first thing I started doing
is shooting a lot of stuff on

05:41.241 --> 05:42.610
the Berkeley campus.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.178
This is the '60s; things
were getting pretty wacky.

05:45.245 --> 05:49.417
*rock music

06:00.127 --> 06:03.431
I was really fascinated
by what cameras could do,

06:03.431 --> 06:06.033
and, in particular, stop motion.

06:06.066 --> 06:08.702
You know, setting a camera on a
tripod and shooting one frame at

06:08.736 --> 06:12.072
a time, making things move.

06:12.105 --> 06:14.942
And animating human bodies.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.744
You know, sort of looked
at this stuff and I said,

06:16.777 --> 06:19.680
"Whoa, that's pretty cool!"

06:19.713 --> 06:23.016
I learned really
quickly how you cut,

06:23.050 --> 06:26.754
how you focus an
audience's attention,

06:26.787 --> 06:30.624
the language of film
and the power of film.

06:30.691 --> 06:34.294
I wasn't a storyteller, but I
saw the power of storytelling.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.367
[clap]

06:40.468 --> 06:43.871
There was a very active
film community in Berkeley --

06:43.904 --> 06:45.873
filmmakers, people
that did various kinds

06:45.906 --> 06:47.575
of experimental films.

06:47.608 --> 06:50.043
*funky ambient music

06:50.077 --> 06:53.080
I organized evenings where I'd
stick an animation camera on the

06:53.113 --> 06:56.283
table, give everybody
a beer in one hand,

06:56.316 --> 06:58.619
blob of clay in the other,
you know, getting a little

06:58.652 --> 07:02.389
inebriated...
taking a puff, as well.

07:04.191 --> 07:05.893
And, of course, most
of this stuff became

07:05.959 --> 07:07.327
a little pornographic.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.530
[glug and swallow]

07:09.563 --> 07:10.964
[vomit]

07:10.998 --> 07:14.568
That was the beginning
of claymation for me.

07:14.635 --> 07:19.406
It was a real
epiphany to see these very,

07:19.507 --> 07:24.512
very crude things
happening on this tabletop,

07:25.679 --> 07:29.850
to see these characters evolve
in this incredibly simple and

07:29.883 --> 07:31.985
non-planned sort of way.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.354
[man laughs]

07:34.387 --> 07:37.891
[birds chirp]

07:37.925 --> 07:41.862
What I was most amazed
about was how this completely

07:41.895 --> 07:46.900
inanimate wad of clay could
move and be imbued with life.

07:47.367 --> 07:52.105
*upbeat piano music

07:57.745 --> 08:01.782
*dreamy music

08:02.115 --> 08:06.554
When I first saw this stuff, it
really made an impression on me.

08:06.587 --> 08:09.757
And I felt -- even then -- that
if I could marry the magic that

08:09.790 --> 08:13.561
I saw with really
solid film skills,

08:13.594 --> 08:15.428
I could be really powerful.

08:25.305 --> 08:27.575
-[Will VO] In order to do
the kind of experimenting that I

08:27.608 --> 08:30.878
wanted to do, taking
it to the next level,

08:30.944 --> 08:34.447
I really kind of
needed a little studio.

08:34.481 --> 08:37.384
And actually managed to buy
a small house in Portland,

08:37.450 --> 08:41.021
and it ended up being my
future animation studio.

08:41.589 --> 08:45.192
Well, for several years while
making live-action and a few cel

08:45.225 --> 08:48.896
animated films, I was working on
a technique of clay animation.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.398
It was a technique that Bob
Gardiner-- a sculptor -- and I

08:51.464 --> 08:53.000
worked on during college.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.203
*mellow ambient music

08:56.236 --> 08:58.672
Bob was crazy,
wonderful artist

08:58.706 --> 09:01.274
-- really out
there -- and just

09:01.308 --> 09:05.613
a kind of a wild energy
that was intoxicating,

09:05.613 --> 09:09.449
and classic artist
with a capital A.

09:09.482 --> 09:12.452
I happened to know that he
would be -- and was -- not

09:12.485 --> 09:14.421
doing anything.

09:14.454 --> 09:18.325
"Say, why don't you come on
up, and let's make a film?"

09:19.126 --> 09:22.663
So Bob came up and lived at my
place and ended up living there

09:22.730 --> 09:25.633
for like a year
and a half, [laughs]

09:25.633 --> 09:28.769
much to my
wife's chagrin.

09:28.802 --> 09:32.472
Because Bob's lifestyle is
loose with various psychedelics,

09:32.505 --> 09:34.407
which I was dabbling
in at the time too,

09:34.441 --> 09:35.843
but not as intensely.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.510
[laughs]

09:37.645 --> 09:40.748
But I always liked working
with really good artists.

09:40.781 --> 09:45.085
Bob was absolutely
one of those people,

09:45.118 --> 09:49.923
in the sense that he was
intensely on another plane.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.926
-[Bill VO] Bob
was a really charming guy.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.663
He was a mad genius.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.665
Together they were
the perfect team.

-[Will VO] We spent a
lot of time in that basement

10:09.176 --> 10:11.812
experimenting with clay...

10:11.845 --> 10:16.850
metamorphosis,
lip-sync, cutting techniques.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.787
Clay animation had
been around forever.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.288
People ask if we invented it.

10:21.321 --> 10:24.792
No, but what we did was brought
it to the forefront by doing a

10:24.825 --> 10:27.560
lot of experimenting.

10:27.627 --> 10:31.865
*contemplative music

10:31.899 --> 10:34.201
I decided to do a little short
short film that really showed

10:34.234 --> 10:36.970
off some of these techniques.

10:43.076 --> 10:45.746
We had trouble keeping the
characters very stable and

10:45.813 --> 10:50.583
steady, and so we tended to make
the characters all be winos so

10:50.650 --> 10:52.385
they could stumble around.

10:52.419 --> 10:56.089

excited about getting it done in

11:17.310 --> 11:21.414
time for this local film
festival here in Portland,

11:21.448 --> 11:23.951
and it was rejected.

11:23.984 --> 11:26.019
We were just devastated.

11:26.086 --> 11:29.589
It was a sad time,
but never stops me.

11:29.622 --> 11:33.493
So I made as many prints as I
could afford and started sending

11:33.526 --> 11:36.196
it around to film festivals.

11:36.263 --> 11:39.332
And suddenly we started
getting amazing response.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.770
Top prize at major,
big-time festivals,

11:42.770 --> 11:45.638

for an Academy Award.

win, we were partying at the

Bob's mother came up to him
with quite a serious face,

12:22.575 --> 12:26.046
and she said this
was too much too soon,

12:26.079 --> 12:29.382
and this is the kiss of death.

12:29.416 --> 12:33.086
It made me really concerned
about what ultimately happens

12:33.120 --> 12:35.823
with Bob.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.591
Winning an Oscar was huge.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.960
Seemed to me kind
of an opportunity

12:39.993 --> 12:42.830
to explore things further.

12:42.830 --> 12:46.266
I was just itching
to do more projects.

12:46.299 --> 12:49.903
But for Bob, winning the Academy
Award was such a heady thing.

12:49.937 --> 12:51.839
[pop, horn blows]

12:51.905 --> 12:56.910
He was off doing all
sorts of crazy things.

12:56.977 --> 13:01.481
Bob would walk around town
with his Oscar in his pocket and

13:01.514 --> 13:04.885
stick it up on a bar and
see who'd buy him drinks.

13:04.918 --> 13:09.522
That was the way he saw what he
was gonna do with this Oscar.

13:10.190 --> 13:13.693
It got to be so hard that
I couldn't count on him.

13:14.061 --> 13:17.230
It was just such a
clash of working styles.

13:17.264 --> 13:20.067
We felt it was good to do our
own things and then help each

13:20.100 --> 13:22.402
other out.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.672
-[Bill VO] Bob set up
his own little studio and he got

13:25.705 --> 13:28.942
a commission from
Rolling Stone to do a TV show.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.445
*rock music

13:32.712 --> 13:35.215
I got to visit his studio
and see what he was doing,

13:35.248 --> 13:36.917
and I was really impressed.

13:36.950 --> 13:41.421
So he did get work
after he left Vinton,

13:41.454 --> 13:44.091
but he wasn't a good businessman
and he couldn't follow through

13:44.124 --> 13:45.592
on it.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.963
I think he was bipolar, so
unfortunately he descended into

13:50.030 --> 13:55.035
this drunken stupor, and he
would rail at Vinton and claim

13:55.702 --> 14:00.707
that he was really the artistic
genius behind 'Closed Mondays,'

14:01.008 --> 14:05.678
that he developed the Claymation
technique and that Vinton never

14:05.712 --> 14:08.181
gave him credit.

14:08.215 --> 14:12.385
Will and him separated, but Will
filled the vacuum left by Bob

14:12.452 --> 14:16.223
with really great animators.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.825
-[Will VO] Everything
I did after that was Will

14:18.926 --> 14:22.062
Vinton Productions.

*groovy ambient music

14:29.937 --> 14:32.940
-That was the
beginning of this wonderful,

14:32.940 --> 14:36.944
delightful
collaborative kind of phase

14:36.944 --> 14:39.212
where the goal was to try
to find some way we could

14:39.246 --> 14:43.316
push the Claymation
into some new areas.

14:43.350 --> 14:44.985
-[Bill VO] He had
this little studio that was

14:45.018 --> 14:47.254
behind a barbershop.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.958
Walk past the barbershop and up
these steps and into this secret

14:50.991 --> 14:53.961
domain, and suddenly
there's an animation studio.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.498
And so it was like going
into a James Bond movie.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.268
[high-pitched swirling noises]

15:01.301 --> 15:02.735
It was like magic.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.972
You would not believe
what it felt like to walk

15:05.005 --> 15:06.339
through that place.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.975
[bike bell rings]

15:08.008 --> 15:11.011
-[Melissa VO] The
studio was like the mother-ship.

15:11.078 --> 15:13.446
I remember clearly
one day thinking,

15:13.480 --> 15:16.984
"We're all gonna end up being
old together and having an old

15:17.017 --> 15:19.486
persons' home-- retirement home.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.254
We're all gonna
be living together."

15:21.288 --> 15:23.023
Because it all felt very close.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.691

15:24.757 --> 15:26.793
-When you walk
away, you track it out.

15:26.826 --> 15:28.295
-[Chuck VO] It
was very hippie-like.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.429
-Can you smell that?

15:29.462 --> 15:30.697
-[Chuck VO] A sort of commune.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.199
-Huh?

15:32.265 --> 15:34.134
You got some of it, don't you?

15:34.167 --> 15:36.003
-[Chuck VO] I
have my actual contract.

15:36.036 --> 15:38.371
It doesn't even have
my real name on it.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.639
It was for fun.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.641
There was nothing
legal about it.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.010
It was just like, "Hey
you wanna work here?

15:43.010 --> 15:44.011
Okay, well what's your name?

15:44.011 --> 15:46.346
I'll just make one up."

15:46.379 --> 15:49.316
The word
"corporate" didn't exist.

15:49.616 --> 15:52.185
It just didn't
feel like a business.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.288
It felt like art
school plus vacation.

15:55.322 --> 15:57.290
***

15:57.324 --> 15:59.792
-[Will VO] We weren't a
very sophisticated business.

15:59.826 --> 16:03.196
We were a collective of
artists focused on doing

16:03.230 --> 16:06.366
good creative work.

16:06.399 --> 16:11.138
-[Michele VO] The energy was
so melodic and forward-moving.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.207
I felt like I was working
with a master who was creating

16:14.241 --> 16:17.610
something really wonderful
that was gonna endure for a

16:17.644 --> 16:20.447
very long time.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.483
-On those cues, we're
gonna turn on the lights.

-[man VO] Will Vinton's
characters seem almost human,

16:42.935 --> 16:45.105
partly because they are.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.807
-[woman VO] In fact, the
entire production is shot and

16:47.840 --> 16:52.845
soundtracks recorded with live
actors before animating begins.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.082
-You keep looking out
the window because--

16:55.082 --> 16:58.685
-I thought that
I-- that you were--

16:58.751 --> 17:02.722
[laughter]

17:04.591 --> 17:06.726
-[Will VO] That whole
first decade was all about

17:06.759 --> 17:10.763
trying to see what we could
do, see how far we could go.

17:10.830 --> 17:15.835
*psychedelic rock music

17:17.770 --> 17:19.206
What's gonna be
different about it?

17:19.239 --> 17:21.841
What are we gonna learn from
this one that we didn't learn

17:21.874 --> 17:24.711
from previous ones, and what
can we take forward into the

17:24.744 --> 17:26.246
next project?

17:26.279 --> 17:29.682
*epic rock music

17:42.195 --> 17:46.799
I hardly even remember
thinking about making money.

17:46.866 --> 17:50.437
The thinking was always about
what we could do to make the

17:50.470 --> 17:53.473
projects as cool as
they could possibly be.

17:53.540 --> 17:54.941
[water bubbles]

17:54.974 --> 17:57.377
We did so many things as
creatively as we did by virtue

17:57.410 --> 17:58.811
of the fact that we
were doing them very,

17:58.878 --> 18:01.981
very inexpensively.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.784
[dinosaur growl]

18:04.817 --> 18:06.819
[slurps]

18:08.155 --> 18:11.358
Lower the budget is, we could
get creative control and do

18:11.391 --> 18:13.726
wonderful things.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.495
-Then they go to the bar and
drink on furlough and they fight

they fight the navy--

18:16.796 --> 18:19.065
[shouting and commotion]

18:19.166 --> 18:20.367
Of course,
there's no coast guard.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.235
Oh, and then, of course, you
know, back home there was the

18:22.302 --> 18:24.471

"Bugle Boy" of Company C.

18:24.504 --> 18:28.241

18:28.308 --> 18:30.477
-[Will VO] We knew we
were pioneering something.

18:30.510 --> 18:34.414
We were doing something that had
never really been done before,

18:34.481 --> 18:39.352
during which we picked up four
more Academy Award nominations.

18:39.386 --> 18:41.854
Nobody ever told
me I couldn't do it.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.891
All I've seen in my experience
-- in my life -- has been that

18:44.924 --> 18:47.394
if you put your mind to it,
and believe that you can do it

18:47.427 --> 18:49.596
-- and want to do
it -- you'll do it.

all charged ahead,

19:12.285 --> 19:14.754
expanding it and trying to grow
it and move it in whatever ways

19:14.787 --> 19:16.623
we possibly could.

didn't have to be in Los Angeles

19:26.833 --> 19:29.669
to do this kind of
work and to get noticed.

19:29.702 --> 19:32.038
-[man VO] Has there ever been a
temptation for you to move from

19:32.104 --> 19:35.107
Portland to Hollywood where
all the big film business is?

19:35.141 --> 19:40.146
-Well, in all honesty there's
some small amount of temptation.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.348
-[Craig VO]
Here you are in Portland,

19:41.381 --> 19:43.816
which is hardly a film center.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.952
Lifestyle mattered
more than money, and

19:45.985 --> 19:48.455
what people did on the
weekends mattered more than

19:48.488 --> 19:49.656
their jobs.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.891
-What I can surmise from
what you're positing is like,

19:51.958 --> 19:54.060
Portland's almost an
alternative universe.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.528
It's almost like
cars don't exist, right?

19:55.562 --> 19:56.496
-Yes!

19:56.529 --> 19:57.464
-You can ride bikes,
or double decker bikes.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.466
They ride unicycles,
they ride the tram,

19:59.499 --> 20:00.467
they ride skateboards.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.701
-Exactly!

20:01.734 --> 20:04.304
-'Portlandia' is almost like
a documentary as far as I'm

20:04.337 --> 20:08.975
concerned in terms of
showing how eccentric and unique

20:09.008 --> 20:12.479
Portland is, and how much
everything's kind of a one-off.

20:12.512 --> 20:15.081
Will's Claymation
studio's like that too.

20:15.147 --> 20:18.217
Nobody else is doing
anything like this.

20:18.251 --> 20:21.321
He wanted to do his own
thing, he created it,

20:21.354 --> 20:23.856
and he gave us all these jobs.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.226
The best stop-motion animators
from around the world all

20:27.260 --> 20:30.830
gravitated to the
famous Will Vinton Studio.

-[Will VO] I'm really
committed to working here,

20:32.732 --> 20:35.835
and there's really no reason
that you have to produce a film

20:35.868 --> 20:39.105
in Hollywood.

-Will the entrepreneur -- Will
the guy who started something

20:44.911 --> 20:48.781
from nothing and did it just
because he wanted to -- if

20:48.848 --> 20:51.884
you're gonna be an entrepreneur,
you're gonna start a company,

20:51.918 --> 20:53.853
you're gonna be the man.

20:53.886 --> 20:56.022
-The first time I
really met Will,

20:56.055 --> 20:59.626
the two words that came
to mind were "white heat,"

20:59.692 --> 21:02.495
a burning ambition
to make a brand,

21:02.529 --> 21:03.996
to make a name.

21:04.030 --> 21:08.935
He just wanted to conquer.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.804
-[Jeffrey VO] A good
decade before Will got started,

21:11.838 --> 21:15.975
there was another eclectic
long-shot small business here

21:16.008 --> 21:17.644
in Oregon.

21:17.677 --> 21:21.180
It was a guy selling
shoes, and it was Phil Knight,

21:21.213 --> 21:22.849
and that company became Nike.

21:22.882 --> 21:24.116
-Oh sweat!
Oh sweat!

21:24.150 --> 21:25.485
Oh sweat, it's Nike!

21:36.363 --> 21:39.466
It became this
world-eating company.

21:40.367 --> 21:44.371
And there's an interesting
parallel between Phil and Will;

21:44.404 --> 21:47.474
they pioneered an
industry and they stuck with it,

21:47.507 --> 21:51.077
and against all odds they
built something pretty special.

21:51.143 --> 21:56.148
And then they sort of came
together and disasters result.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.385
-[woman] Mr. Knight,
please raise your right hand.

21:58.385 --> 22:00.420
Do you solemnly swear that this
testimony will be the truth,

22:00.487 --> 22:01.421
the whole truth, and
nothing but the truth,

22:01.454 --> 22:02.455
so help you God?

22:02.489 --> 22:03.890
-I do.
-[woman] Thank you.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.626
-Mr. Knight, would you explain
what first interested you in

22:06.659 --> 22:09.429
investing in Will
Vinton Studios?

22:09.462 --> 22:12.565
-Wil Vinton had approached me
in the spring of '98 about the

22:12.599 --> 22:14.967
possibility of investing
in Will Vinton Studios,

22:15.001 --> 22:17.136
and I was intrigued.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.838
-And what intrigued you?

22:18.905 --> 22:20.907
-Well, first of all, profitable.

22:20.940 --> 22:22.842
They had been in
existence a long time,

22:22.909 --> 22:24.677
they had won an
Academy Award, and

22:24.744 --> 22:28.280
they'd had considerable artistic
success in the creative field,

22:28.314 --> 22:30.817
and I was interested in that.

22:30.850 --> 22:35.488
-Was there any intent to do
future Will Vinton Studios

22:35.522 --> 22:38.925
animation outside of Portland?

22:38.958 --> 22:43.963
-What do future plans outside
of Portland have to do with any

22:44.030 --> 22:46.098
subject matter of this lawsuit?

22:46.132 --> 22:49.135

I don't need to go into it.

I would think that it would
be hard to separate the two.

23:25.472 --> 23:26.473
-[Vinton] It is.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.074
-And we really live
two separate lives.

23:28.107 --> 23:30.910
When we were working really
intensely on something -- I

23:30.943 --> 23:33.145

I don't remember us ever having
to wrestle with his conscience.

complete surprise to me.

24:27.900 --> 24:30.269
He had a wife prior to me.

24:30.336 --> 24:33.105
He left her in
exactly the same way.

24:33.740 --> 24:35.908
12 years...

24:37.209 --> 24:40.279
no discussions about it,

24:41.581 --> 24:43.883
no looking back.

24:44.917 --> 24:48.287
He was a mystery to himself.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.289
-[Michele VO]
He's a very complex man.

24:50.356 --> 24:53.926
The place he felt most free to
express himself was in his work.

24:53.960 --> 24:56.929
***

24:56.963 --> 24:58.765
-[Mary VO] Will on one
hand showed himself to

24:58.798 --> 25:01.568
the world through his art.

25:02.569 --> 25:06.272
He had all of these characters
who, of course, were expressing

25:06.305 --> 25:08.440
facets of himself.

25:08.474 --> 25:12.712
And yet he was also
a very private man.

25:13.680 --> 25:16.816
There's a lot of people, maybe
most of the people who know Will

25:16.849 --> 25:20.152
who might say, "I never
really quite knew him.

25:20.186 --> 25:24.390
I could never
quite figure him out."

25:24.456 --> 25:28.027
He had trouble
expressing emotions

25:28.060 --> 25:29.729
when it wasn't with clay.

25:29.796 --> 25:32.799
***

25:32.832 --> 25:36.836
-I see Will as a character,
a character with a dream,

25:36.869 --> 25:41.874
with a character flaw, and
with a kind of a sadness.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.648
-[Will VO] Characters
have an infinite range of

25:48.681 --> 25:52.518
emotions and expressions, but
there aren't an infinite number

25:52.619 --> 25:55.655
that they use.

25:55.922 --> 26:00.026
A character usually
stays in character.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.229
*chimes ascend

26:03.262 --> 26:04.664
-[woman] All together now!

26:04.731 --> 26:07.133
-Ho ho ho, hee
hee hee, ha ha ha!

26:07.166 --> 26:10.102
-[Will VO] The pressure on
this first creative phase is

26:10.136 --> 26:14.173
that we wanted to keep
the bar extremely high,

26:14.240 --> 26:17.109
and we wanted to
do feature films.

26:17.143 --> 26:20.479
-As things began to get bigger
and bigger and pretty soon he's

26:20.512 --> 26:22.682
having what he wants -- which
he always told me was to be the

26:22.749 --> 26:25.985
second Walt Disney -- and
it looked as if maybe that

26:26.018 --> 26:27.453
were happening.

26:27.486 --> 26:32.491
*uplifting ambient music

26:32.925 --> 26:34.994
-[Jerry VO] There were
definitely parallels between the

26:35.027 --> 26:38.364
young Will Vinton Studios
and Walt Disney Studios.

26:38.665 --> 26:42.268
Each success followed by a
way to follow up on that in a

26:42.301 --> 26:45.504
commercial way, and
then if you can do that,

26:45.537 --> 26:48.474
you can experiment and
make 'Fantasia' or build

26:48.507 --> 26:49.776
a Disneyland.

26:49.809 --> 26:53.479
Will had it.
He was actually doing it.

26:53.512 --> 26:54.480
He won his Oscar.

26:54.513 --> 26:55.882
He was making shorts.

26:55.948 --> 26:58.284
He was making a feature,
which was 'The Adventures of

26:58.317 --> 27:00.219
Mark Twain.'

27:00.286 --> 27:04.390
-A man with a
new idea is a fool...

27:04.423 --> 27:07.393
until the idea succeeds.

27:07.426 --> 27:10.062
-[Will VO] 'The Adventures of
Mark Twain' was the zenith of

27:10.096 --> 27:12.699
Claymation because
the whole kitchen sink

27:12.699 --> 27:15.267
was thrown in there.

27:15.301 --> 27:18.570
A lot of the techniques that you
saw in some of the short films

27:18.604 --> 27:20.572
that came before it.

27:20.606 --> 27:23.442
-[Craig VO] Clay
painting from 'The Creation...'

27:25.077 --> 27:28.414
metamorphosis from
'The Great Cognito...'

27:30.316 --> 27:33.953
special effects that we used in
things like 'The Little Prince.'

27:34.821 --> 27:36.055
There's nothing like it.

27:36.088 --> 27:38.590
There's nothing
even remotely like it.

27:38.825 --> 27:42.061
Will wanted this to feel like
you were in his clay world.

27:43.095 --> 27:45.965
Furniture was made out of
clay, the walls were clay,

27:45.998 --> 27:48.735
the pictures on
the wall were clay.

27:48.735 --> 27:51.403
-It is a landmark achievement
in the motion picture field,

27:51.437 --> 27:54.506
and that is because it is the
first clay-animated feature

27:54.573 --> 27:57.143
movie ever made.

27:57.744 --> 27:59.611
-[Melissa VO] A lot
was riding on 'The Adventures

27:59.645 --> 28:02.014
of Mark Twain.'

28:02.048 --> 28:06.352
It was in production over five
years with a small crew toiling

28:06.385 --> 28:09.889
over this very tedious
process of making this movie.

28:10.222 --> 28:12.224
-The basic
philosophy has not changed.

28:12.258 --> 28:14.426
Vinton and his staff hope
to continue to be a form of

28:14.493 --> 28:16.996
entertainment
primarily for adults.

28:17.029 --> 28:19.832
You'll never see Will Vinton's
name on the kind of things that

28:19.866 --> 28:23.335
you're seeing now on
Saturday morning TV.

28:25.571 --> 28:28.007
-[Melissa VO] Will felt
that this is a sophisticated

28:28.040 --> 28:31.677
film that should
appeal to adults.

28:31.778 --> 28:35.614
And it just didn't get
marketed in that way.

28:35.681 --> 28:37.683
-The interesting
thing is the movie,

28:37.784 --> 28:40.920
it's kind of a dark story, and
there were warning labels on

28:40.953 --> 28:43.689
those cassettes that say, "This
may not be suitable for your

28:43.790 --> 28:46.558
child," which was the kiss
of death if you're trying to

28:46.592 --> 28:48.194
release a children's movie.

28:48.227 --> 28:51.397
*melancholy ambient music

28:51.430 --> 28:54.967
-[Melissa VO] 'Mark Twain' had
a really disappointing premiere.

28:56.869 --> 28:58.871
People would
take their children,

28:58.905 --> 29:01.941
or they didn't always
get the next level of

29:01.974 --> 29:05.812
humor or sophistication.

29:05.812 --> 29:08.380
-[voice on speaker] Welcome
to the mysterious stranger.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.683
[children whispering]

29:11.717 --> 29:13.152
-Hello.

29:13.185 --> 29:14.653
-Who are you?

29:14.686 --> 29:15.888
-Satan.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.124
-Uh oh.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.826
-[Will VO] Well, there's
no question I was hoping

29:19.826 --> 29:22.862
'Mark Twain' would be
the beginning of doing more

29:22.895 --> 29:24.831
feature projects.

29:24.864 --> 29:27.699
***

29:27.733 --> 29:31.737
I think above all I was
disappointed with what happens

29:31.838 --> 29:36.008
in the world of distribution.

29:36.042 --> 29:39.846
-That was a real sad thing that
nobody seemed to know what to do

29:39.846 --> 29:42.915
with this magical stuff.

29:42.982 --> 29:47.019
He had a capacity to put things
in a place where they wouldn't

29:47.053 --> 29:51.991
interfere or slow him down, but
in his private place with just

29:52.024 --> 29:55.895
himself, he and him,
it hurt him very much.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.669
-I did a bit of soul searching
and thought about how the

30:03.702 --> 30:08.574
creative process works, and I've
come up with what I think is my

30:08.607 --> 30:11.377
most creative project to date,
which I would like to introduce

30:11.410 --> 30:14.213
to you at this time.

30:14.546 --> 30:17.283
[applause]

30:17.349 --> 30:19.618
This is Billy.

30:19.685 --> 30:21.520
Say hello!
[chuckles]

30:21.553 --> 30:24.123
Let's look at the creative
process and how it works.

30:24.190 --> 30:26.926
[audience laughter]

30:26.959 --> 30:28.861
It all starts with an idea.

30:28.895 --> 30:31.630
Perhaps nothing more
than a twinkle in your eye.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.200
And in time, with a
little give and take,

30:34.233 --> 30:38.237
assuming the idea
finds fertile ground,

30:38.270 --> 30:41.807
it may soon be fully conceived.

30:41.874 --> 30:43.409
But you still don't
know what you've got.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.377
[audience laughter]

30:45.411 --> 30:47.446
As the concept goes
into a gestation period,

30:47.479 --> 30:49.481
it grows and it modifies.

30:49.548 --> 30:52.384
Finally, the project is
fully realized with a tremendous

30:52.418 --> 30:53.819
amount of effort.

30:53.886 --> 30:54.954
And is released-- [Billy coos]

30:54.987 --> 30:56.488
Yeah.
[audience laughter]

30:56.555 --> 30:58.790
And is
released for all to see.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.792
To the creators it's
hard to be objective,

31:00.826 --> 31:04.196
and it often looks pretty
bad when it first comes out.

31:04.230 --> 31:07.666
But at that point, one can't
help but sort of feel like

31:07.699 --> 31:11.938
you're-- question what it is
you've really done as a creator,

31:11.938 --> 31:16.175
and before long a strong sense
of pride generally results to

31:16.208 --> 31:19.245
the point where you may
even consider doing it again.

31:19.311 --> 31:22.581
[laughter]

31:22.648 --> 31:23.950
We have Mummy.

31:23.950 --> 31:26.418
-[laughs]

31:26.485 --> 31:29.221
-[Will] And Billy.

31:29.588 --> 31:31.190
-Let me stand up and
show how pregnant.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.258
-[Will] Very pregnant.

31:32.324 --> 31:34.360
There it is.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.561
That's Jesse.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.029
-Yeah, this is Jesse.

31:37.063 --> 31:40.232
Oh my God, there they go!

31:40.266 --> 31:41.433
-[Jesse VO] He was
always interested in looking

31:41.500 --> 31:44.003
for projects that
we could do with him.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.871
Even though he wasn't the kind
of person that would really say

31:45.972 --> 31:48.707
a lot of "I love yous"

31:48.740 --> 31:51.410
or really kind of
show affection...

31:51.443 --> 31:53.545
[drumming]

31:53.579 --> 31:56.082
You know, he had his own way
of constantly showing us that he

31:56.115 --> 31:57.549
loved us.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.386
*mellow ambient music

32:00.419 --> 32:02.821
The best times that we
had with one another,

32:02.854 --> 32:05.992
we were actively trying
to accomplish a goal,

32:05.992 --> 32:08.995
making something,
creating something.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.531
Going to cut down
a Christmas tree,

32:12.598 --> 32:15.334
we would literally hack
down like a 20-foot tree,

32:15.367 --> 32:18.137
and we'd bring it home.

32:19.371 --> 32:22.308
Billy and I were six and eight
years old and we were like up on

32:22.341 --> 32:25.544
the balcony with like a
rope-pulley system that my dad

32:25.611 --> 32:28.014
had like showed us how to
like rig on the top of the tree,

32:28.014 --> 32:30.882
and he's down below trying
to like push the tree up.

32:32.018 --> 32:33.285
-[woman] There's Will.

32:33.319 --> 32:35.554
-[man] There's Will.

32:35.621 --> 32:37.023
-[woman] The man
with the camera,

32:37.023 --> 32:40.359
and now we're moving in on him,
because-- Billy don't pull on

32:40.392 --> 32:42.394
the camera!

32:42.461 --> 32:44.330
-[woman] Get a close-up of him
so that we know that Daddy was

32:44.363 --> 32:45.864
here too.

32:45.897 --> 32:47.199
-[Jesse VO] Things
were really taking off for the

32:47.233 --> 32:50.169
studio, and it
was growing rapidly.

32:50.202 --> 32:53.239
He spent an enormous
amount of time at the studio,

32:53.305 --> 32:56.675
and maybe prioritized
that over family a little bit.

32:56.708 --> 32:59.045
I think that's
what he had to do.

32:59.045 --> 33:02.414
***

33:02.748 --> 33:05.151
-Oh, look at the...

33:05.217 --> 33:06.618
-[Melissa VO]
After 'Mark Twain' had a really

33:06.652 --> 33:09.221
disappointing premiere,
we were all depressed.

33:09.255 --> 33:10.922
Will came back,
and was like, "Well,

33:10.956 --> 33:14.593
let's get to
work," like undaunted.

33:15.294 --> 33:16.562
[claps]

33:16.595 --> 33:20.166
-"Okay, let's get rolling," and
he would say that without fail.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.301
And so that's just the kind
of guy he was -- it was like,

33:22.334 --> 33:25.571
[clap] "Okay,
let's get rolling."

33:25.604 --> 33:28.640
-[Hal VO] I've never seen
him exhibit frustration or anger

33:28.674 --> 33:31.577
or being down.

33:31.610 --> 33:36.248
So it is hard to sort of see him
as a fully rounded human being,

33:36.282 --> 33:39.151
because he's always
got that outward-facing,

33:39.185 --> 33:41.320
optimistic demeanor.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.090
You wonder, "What
are the secret doubts?"

33:44.123 --> 33:48.660
*anxious ambient music

33:48.694 --> 33:51.997
-[Will VO] My parents
were always just so supportive

33:52.098 --> 33:55.167
of trying things,
of experimenting.

33:55.201 --> 33:58.137
What they would say,
"Yeah okay, what's next?"

33:58.837 --> 34:01.273
And I'm like that
myself, like, "That was cool.

34:01.307 --> 34:03.542
That was really fun.
Okay, let's see what's next."

34:03.575 --> 34:06.545
[laughs]
Kind of look around.

34:06.578 --> 34:10.216
The California Raisin Advisory
Board came to us with the idea

34:10.249 --> 34:14.186
of personifying
raisins that moved to

34:14.220 --> 34:16.688
"I Heard It
Through the Grapevine."

34:16.722 --> 34:21.127
*Ooh, I heard it
through the grapevine*

34:21.127 --> 34:25.631
*Raised in the
California sunshine*

34:25.697 --> 34:28.700
-I was the director on the
first California Raisins spot,

34:28.734 --> 34:32.138
and I thought, "Man,
what a dorky commercial.

34:32.138 --> 34:34.140
Nobody's ever gonna
see this commercial.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.442
I'm wasting my time."

34:36.475 --> 34:39.711
-[Will VO] A tiny, tiny
little advertising campaign

34:39.745 --> 34:41.980
just took off.

34:42.047 --> 34:45.451
It went viral in an era
where "viral" didn't exist yet.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.155
-It seems almost everyone is
wild about these raisins and

34:49.155 --> 34:51.157
their hip sales pitch.

34:51.223 --> 34:54.160
-[Will VO] The fact that
it's taken the nation by storm

34:54.160 --> 34:56.162
is kind of quite a surprise.

34:56.228 --> 34:58.597
-[man VO] Raisins are more
popular with youngsters than old

34:58.630 --> 35:00.466
favorites like Charlie Brown.

35:00.499 --> 35:03.001
A true advertising phenomenon.

35:03.034 --> 35:05.637
*groovy music

35:05.671 --> 35:07.506
-[man VO] America
has gone raisin crazy.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.641
We have raisin
t-shirts, raisin sweatshirts,

35:09.675 --> 35:13.179
raisin coffee mugs.

35:13.179 --> 35:16.182
-[Will VO] Claymation
was on people's tongues

35:16.182 --> 35:19.251
in a way that it
never had been before.

35:19.518 --> 35:21.520
I can't tell you how
many times people said,

35:21.553 --> 35:24.690
"Wow, what's it like to
be an overnight success?"

35:24.723 --> 35:25.524
-[woman VO] Well,
we've all heard of

35:25.557 --> 35:27.493
the overnight sensation--

35:27.526 --> 35:29.828
-And I'm going, "Yeah,
after 15 years of doing this."

35:29.861 --> 35:30.862
You know?

35:30.896 --> 35:33.031
-Will Vinton is an
Academy Award winner,

35:33.064 --> 35:35.601
but hardly anybody knew
his name until he made a

35:35.667 --> 35:37.569
television commercial.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.372
-[Will VO] To me,
commercials were little films,

35:40.406 --> 35:45.411
using characters to
really connect with audiences.

35:45.544 --> 35:48.447
-We have a hit now, and it's
opening up all these new doors

35:48.514 --> 35:51.783
for us, and we're a busy studio.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.552
[squeaky laughter]

35:53.585 --> 35:56.422
-[man VO] Meet the Noid...

35:56.455 --> 35:59.891
the star of Domino's
Pizza commercials.

35:59.925 --> 36:03.995
-The Noid happened the same time
the California Raisins happened

36:04.029 --> 36:05.631
and just blew up.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.333
They were huge.

36:07.366 --> 36:10.336
But we won an award for
being the stupidest ad campaign.

36:10.369 --> 36:12.037
I don't get it.
He hates pizza?

36:12.103 --> 36:14.873
He loves pizza?
He wrecks pizza?

36:14.940 --> 36:16.642
So why should I get Domino's?

36:16.675 --> 36:18.377
[zapping]

36:18.444 --> 36:22.113
[grunting]

36:22.147 --> 36:23.715
-[man] Does it sell pizzas?
-Oh, absolutely.

36:23.782 --> 36:24.950
Like crazy.

36:24.983 --> 36:27.353
-[Melissa VO] People
became aware of this process of

36:27.386 --> 36:30.021
Claymation, and they
wanted to be part of it.

36:30.055 --> 36:33.525
-[man VO] Nike
makes aerobic shoes...

36:33.559 --> 36:35.461
tennis shoes...

36:35.494 --> 36:37.796
-[Will VO] There
was a lot of capital.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.865
One of the accountants said,
"What are you guys doing over

36:39.898 --> 36:42.501
there?
You printing money?"

36:42.534 --> 36:47.506
He was so surprised at
the level of profitability.

36:47.539 --> 36:51.510
My father finally [laughing]
stopped wondering when I was

36:51.543 --> 36:53.712
gonna get a real job. [laughs]

36:53.745 --> 36:56.282
And he said that to me.

36:56.315 --> 36:59.651
-I'd like to thank
our family and friends...

36:59.685 --> 37:01.853
and Will.

37:01.887 --> 37:05.724
-Bob Gardiner saw that Will
moving forward with their idea

37:05.757 --> 37:08.794
and creating a company
that didn't include him,

37:08.827 --> 37:13.064
he felt that he had been
slighted or robbed of something.

37:13.098 --> 37:15.501
-[Susan VO] Everybody
knew Bob was kind of crazy.

37:15.567 --> 37:19.671
Crazy Bob, funny crazy Bob, who
wasn't so funny after a while.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.907
-[David VO] His activity
would flare up whenever the

37:21.940 --> 37:24.075
studio was
getting a lot of press.

37:24.109 --> 37:26.011
It seemed to agitate him.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.746
-"Claymation" -- you
coined the phrase?

37:27.779 --> 37:29.748
-Yeah, right.
-[Barbara] It's just clay--

37:29.781 --> 37:32.117
-It comes from "clay animation."

37:32.150 --> 37:33.419
-[David VO] You'd
come to work in the morning,

37:33.452 --> 37:37.489
and there'd be graffiti on the
wall outside that was clearly a

37:37.523 --> 37:39.458
message from Bob.

37:39.491 --> 37:41.527
-[Susan VO]
He wrote "Swill Vinton,

37:41.593 --> 37:44.996
Mediocre Crap" like in
five-foot high letters.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.434
-[David VO] He would
call Vinton up in the middle of

37:48.467 --> 37:52.338
the night, yell at
him, and threaten him.

37:53.705 --> 37:56.342
-Hello?

37:56.475 --> 37:58.143
-[Melissa VO]
There would be death threats--

37:58.176 --> 37:59.645
-Yes, uh huh.

37:59.678 --> 38:03.582
-[Melissal VO] And the studio
had to take those seriously.

38:03.615 --> 38:04.850
Will carried a gun.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.719
-Okay, yeah.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.791
-My name is Nicolle
Gardiner-Sampson,

38:12.858 --> 38:16.528
and Bob Gardiner was my father.

38:16.562 --> 38:19.731
I probably won't ever
meet anybody like my dad.

38:21.467 --> 38:24.536
If you approached him, he would
often have a story to tell,

38:24.570 --> 38:27.038
or he'd play the piano for you.

38:27.072 --> 38:30.376
He would draw with you
and doodle with you.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.811
Nothing was ever typical.

38:32.878 --> 38:34.780
It was magical.

38:34.813 --> 38:38.550
I knew that Bob and
Will had a falling out since

38:38.584 --> 38:40.419
I was a little girl.

38:40.452 --> 38:44.155
I think it was always a
ghost that haunted him,

38:44.222 --> 38:47.393
and he struggled letting go.

38:47.393 --> 38:52.063
*moody music

38:52.097 --> 38:56.502
-By the way, is Mr. Gardiner
the one who is the true creator

38:56.568 --> 38:59.070
of Claymation?

39:00.138 --> 39:02.408
-Um, why would you ask that?

39:02.474 --> 39:04.710
-I don't want to
hear, "Why would I?"

39:04.743 --> 39:08.914
because your complaint alleges
that you are widely recognized

39:08.980 --> 39:12.684
as a creative genius and
the developer of Claymation.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.720
Answer the question.

39:14.753 --> 39:16.888
-Mr. Gardiner, absolutely not.

39:16.922 --> 39:19.491
-[man] Did you develop it
jointly with Mr. Gardiner?

39:19.525 --> 39:20.992
-Absolutely not.

39:21.026 --> 39:25.564
Claymation was developed,
five or-- several years after I

39:25.597 --> 39:30.602
worked with Bob
Gardiner-- coined.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.571
-See, that wasn't hard.

39:32.604 --> 39:35.741
***

39:39.611 --> 39:42.848
-[David VO] Bob was
an incredibly creative artist,

39:42.881 --> 39:46.251
somewhat mad,
somewhat delusional.

39:46.284 --> 39:49.555
He was good with inspired ideas,
but he couldn't execute on them.

39:50.355 --> 39:52.724
So you gotta give Will credit
that probably 'Closed Mondays'

39:52.758 --> 39:54.059
got executed at all.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.194
If it was up to Bob, that
film probably would never

39:56.227 --> 39:57.963
have been made.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.298
As much art as he put into it,
he needed someone to guide him

40:00.365 --> 40:05.103
through actually
finishing something.

40:05.136 --> 40:08.907
-Will produced it -- that's what
he did -- and a lot of the stuff

40:08.940 --> 40:10.809
you see there is Bob.

40:10.876 --> 40:12.310
The stuff that
people go, "Ooo-ooo!"

40:12.377 --> 40:14.145
-- that's Bob.

40:14.212 --> 40:16.782
*jaunty music

40:16.815 --> 40:20.719
-What was that guy thinking of?

40:20.752 --> 40:23.288
Puh.

40:24.723 --> 40:27.225
-With most things in life,
there was a grain of truth to

40:27.258 --> 40:29.160
some of it.

40:29.227 --> 40:31.563
Was this just a really angry
guy who was making up all these

40:31.597 --> 40:34.733
ideas about what had
happened in that relationship,

40:34.766 --> 40:38.604
or was he really an aggrieved
creative who felt he didn't get

40:38.637 --> 40:42.440
his due?

40:47.946 --> 40:49.581
*news jingle

40:49.615 --> 40:50.982
-Portland's own
California Raisins are

40:51.016 --> 40:52.484
back in the news again.

40:52.518 --> 40:55.120
They have a new home video out,
and to give you an idea of how

40:55.153 --> 40:57.322
good it's selling, it reached
platinum even before it hit

40:57.355 --> 40:58.757
the stores.

40:58.790 --> 41:01.960
-One of the first productions we
did as an entertainment project

41:01.993 --> 41:05.864
was a CBS primetime special
called 'Meet the Raisins!' and

41:05.897 --> 41:10.235
it was done rockumentary
parody of 'Meet the Beatles.'

41:11.236 --> 41:16.007
-The California Raisins, these
four working class musicians

41:16.041 --> 41:19.945
have risen from garden
variety band to pop phenomenon.

41:20.546 --> 41:24.049
But what are the
roots of such genius?

41:24.082 --> 41:26.685
From whence doth it spring?

41:26.718 --> 41:29.955
-[Will VO] First time I'd gotten
into primetime television.

41:30.288 --> 41:32.791
-It's a movie camera!

41:32.858 --> 41:35.026
So do something.

41:35.060 --> 41:36.094
[clonk]

41:36.127 --> 41:37.763
[growls]

41:37.796 --> 41:39.765
-[man VO] We bear fortunate
witness to the youngsters'

41:39.798 --> 41:43.902
discovery of tonal
resonance and harmony.

41:43.935 --> 41:48.106
-So far we had had anonymous
raisins in all of these spots,

41:48.139 --> 41:50.576
and we wanted to kind of
create distinctive characters

41:50.576 --> 41:54.079
for entertainment purposes, so
we created the California Raisin

41:54.112 --> 41:55.213
Band with--

41:55.246 --> 41:57.616
-[man VO] A.C.,
Beebop, Stretch, and Red.

your love's still strong*

delivered, I'm yours*

42:13.298 --> 42:15.300
[cheering]

42:15.333 --> 42:17.703
-[Will VO] The
show won a Primetime Emmy,

42:17.736 --> 42:20.405
and that was a really, really
successful project in terms of

42:20.471 --> 42:23.174
popularity, and in terms of
moving the Raisins to a new

42:23.208 --> 42:26.845
level, which was just
pure music entertainment.

42:26.878 --> 42:28.479
[gunfire]

42:28.513 --> 42:30.215
-Upcoming projects
include a number of television

42:30.248 --> 42:34.152
commercials, a music video --
that for reasons of secrecy we

42:34.185 --> 42:37.723
can only say is
for a major pop star.

to call me.
This is very important.

Thank you, bye.

Let's do something
here, be pioneers.

Will?

43:08.987 --> 43:10.188
[hangs up]

43:10.255 --> 43:11.657
-[Webster VO]
Michael was a big fan.

43:11.657 --> 43:14.926
He saw Will as a Disney
figure, and he was a big fan

43:14.960 --> 43:16.361
of the work.

43:16.427 --> 43:17.996
-[Will VO] He got around
to saying how much he loved the

43:18.029 --> 43:20.932
California Raisin commercials,
so I realized where he was

43:20.966 --> 43:25.003
going, and I said, "Michael,
you should be a Raisin."

43:25.036 --> 43:29.174
-The rap raisins
materializing behind me.

43:29.675 --> 43:33.679
I wanted to define the character
and find his expression,

43:33.679 --> 43:38.049
which is 99 percent of it.

43:39.117 --> 43:42.153
The one guy has the glasses,
and he has the type of attitude

43:42.187 --> 43:46.892
that-- he's so cool that
I'm fortunate that he's here.

43:47.893 --> 43:50.696
And he's much too
cool for, like, one of these.

43:54.700 --> 43:55.834
It's like, "What
you lookin' at?"

43:55.867 --> 43:58.036
The other raisin
would be this style,

43:58.069 --> 44:02.207
no glasses, so his eyes--
it's mostly the expression.

44:11.049 --> 44:15.286

Grapevine" by Michael Jackson*

They are one of the hottest
headliner acts in the country.

44:43.014 --> 44:45.083
You may be wondering
who has the rights to

44:45.116 --> 44:47.252
all that Raisin paraphernalia.

44:47.285 --> 44:50.021
Well, it's the California
Raisins Advisory Board,

44:50.088 --> 44:52.323
not Will Vinton.

44:52.357 --> 44:54.926
-This is the famous
blunder that he regretted,

44:54.960 --> 44:58.596
where he didn't get a
portion of the licensing,

44:58.629 --> 45:01.967

was gonna be a big deal, really.

[laughs] and to work on the
next Raisin show because we had

45:33.899 --> 45:37.435
already done that, and our
culture was built around,

45:37.468 --> 45:38.804
you know, "Do
something different."

You know, "What else can we do?"

hard to create some intellectual

wanted to try and create their

45:48.213 --> 45:50.982
own characters that they would
own all the merchandising on,

45:51.049 --> 45:53.251
their own Mickey Mouse.

Instead of Mickey Mouse
ears we had rubber pig noses.

46:24.382 --> 46:26.017

would used to say that Wilshire

46:26.051 --> 46:28.519
Pig was his alter ego.

-You get offered five million
bucks to do a commercial,

-There's the tycoon
element to that character.

46:36.361 --> 46:39.530
He sort of like the
greedy capitalist.

46:39.564 --> 46:42.100
That might be the way that he
thought of himself as Wilshire

46:42.167 --> 46:45.904
Pig, probably as not as the good
parts of himself but rather the

46:45.937 --> 46:49.440
kind of dirty things he had to
do to find success at the level

46:49.507 --> 46:50.741
that he found it.

46:50.775 --> 46:52.677
[explosion]

46:52.710 --> 46:56.114
-He was building this idea of,
"If I create these characters--

46:56.181 --> 46:58.583
[rumbling]

46:58.616 --> 47:00.185
[shouts]

47:00.218 --> 47:02.520
--then after that I can make
a bunch of films with those

47:02.553 --> 47:05.991
characters, and from that I
can make an amusement park."

47:06.024 --> 47:09.160
-The point of amusement
rides is not amusement.

47:09.194 --> 47:11.997
The point of amusement
rides is making money!

47:12.030 --> 47:14.966
[gears crank]

47:15.000 --> 47:17.035
[coins jingle]

47:17.102 --> 47:19.037
Perfect!

47:19.104 --> 47:20.671

47:20.705 --> 47:23.274
-[Chuck VO] They were
always trying to get the thing

47:23.308 --> 47:26.444
that would make
the amusement park.

47:28.379 --> 47:31.816
It's like he was
looking down a checklist,

47:31.917 --> 47:35.120
and he was ticking off the
boxes of what he needed to

47:35.153 --> 47:38.023
become Disney.

47:41.659 --> 47:43.694
-[man's voice on TV] Will Vinton
-- the creator of Claymation --

47:43.728 --> 47:46.932
is now creating
Claymation Station,

47:46.965 --> 47:48.934
a year-round entertainment park.

47:48.967 --> 47:51.669
It would be on 15 to 20
acres behind Union Station,

47:51.702 --> 47:55.040
serving as a depot to
transport people to real places,

47:55.073 --> 47:58.643
to other worlds, and to the
far reaches of imagination.

47:58.843 --> 48:01.646
There would be rides and
shops, a 3-D movie theater,

48:01.679 --> 48:05.083
restaurants, a large hotel,
and motion picture studios.

48:05.984 --> 48:08.319
Can Will Vinton
make it a success?

48:08.386 --> 48:10.956
Well, he's already
made raisins dance,

48:10.989 --> 48:13.291
so who's to say his latest
brainstorm is pushing the

48:13.324 --> 48:14.960
imagination too far?

48:14.960 --> 48:16.427
[static]

48:16.461 --> 48:17.996
*moody ambient music

48:18.063 --> 48:19.497
-[Bill VO] Bob Gardiner
would call me in the middle of

48:19.564 --> 48:23.268
the night from some ghost town
where he was doing tours of the

48:23.301 --> 48:26.304
empty mining shafts.

48:26.337 --> 48:30.075
He'd still complain about
Will Vinton and how he got

48:30.108 --> 48:32.243
ripped off.

48:32.743 --> 48:34.579
-[Nicolle VO]
My dad kind of picked up this

48:34.612 --> 48:37.315
day-job lifestyle.

48:37.348 --> 48:41.186
It just kind of seemed
like him letting go.

48:42.020 --> 48:44.990
He let go of his creativity.

48:44.990 --> 48:48.126
He talked a lot about
Will, and that was it.

48:50.528 --> 48:53.098
-Good morning everybody,
and welcome to Portland,

48:53.131 --> 48:55.133
Oregon for the Grand
Floral Parade which is

48:55.166 --> 48:56.667
about to get underway.

48:56.701 --> 48:59.637
-[Bill VO] Bob Gardiner
threatened to assassinate Will

48:59.670 --> 49:01.772
Vinton at the Rose
Festival Parade.

49:01.806 --> 49:04.375
[gun clicks]

49:04.409 --> 49:07.112
*ominous strings

49:07.178 --> 49:09.680
Gardiner was gonna have a scope
rifle up on the top of the Meier

49:09.714 --> 49:12.517
& Frank Building and off him.

49:12.550 --> 49:14.285
-[man VO] And there he
is, you heard it through the

49:14.352 --> 49:15.686
grapevine, folks.

49:15.720 --> 49:19.290
That's Will Vinton, the
Grand Marshal of the parade.

49:21.192 --> 49:24.429
-[Bill VO] Will -- to
be safe -- got the FBI to patrol

49:24.462 --> 49:27.398
all the rooves of the buildings
along the parade route.

49:27.432 --> 49:30.201
***

49:30.235 --> 49:31.936
-[woman VO] You've
certainly seen his work with the

49:32.037 --> 49:34.605
California Raisins.

49:36.407 --> 49:40.078
Looks like he brought a few
of his friends with him today.

49:42.213 --> 49:44.649
-[Bill VO] For
something to do with cartoons,

49:44.715 --> 49:48.786
it just seems
really out of whack.

49:53.291 --> 49:57.062
-[Will VO] Bob and I did a
wonderful thing together.

49:57.762 --> 50:01.466
I wish that we could've both
cherished that into the sunset.

50:03.434 --> 50:06.404
It's hard for me to talk
about it because it was such

50:06.437 --> 50:08.839
a sad thing.

50:08.906 --> 50:11.842
I knew that he
was in a lot of pain.

50:11.909 --> 50:16.914
When I heard that he had,
uh, committed suicide, um...

50:18.249 --> 50:20.185
I was...

50:20.251 --> 50:22.987
I was...shocked.

50:23.020 --> 50:26.591
I guess I-- you
could say, but...

50:26.624 --> 50:30.695
somehow strangely
not completely surprised.

50:32.130 --> 50:36.534
I wished so much at that time
that I really could've helped to

50:36.601 --> 50:40.338
celebrate who he
was as a person,

50:40.371 --> 50:43.174
as an artist...

50:43.208 --> 50:47.945
and tell him how sorry
I felt about the whole thing.

50:47.978 --> 50:51.516
***

50:51.549 --> 50:56.554
-I went to help pack up his
stuff and being in his place --

50:57.622 --> 51:02.627
boxing everything --
was really haunting,

51:04.529 --> 51:06.931
looking at all the
stuff that he left out.

51:06.964 --> 51:10.435
He had Marvin Gaye "Heard It
Through the Grapevine" sitting

51:10.468 --> 51:14.405
open on his little piano.

51:14.439 --> 51:17.142
That particular song

51:17.142 --> 51:21.045
was this, like, goodbye to Will.

51:23.714 --> 51:27.252
My dad's work will
always keep him alive.

51:27.285 --> 51:30.455
I can always go back and
look through his writing.

51:31.156 --> 51:32.390
I can look through his drawings.

51:32.423 --> 51:35.426
I can watch 'Closed Mondays.'

51:35.760 --> 51:40.565
The expressions through his
drawings or his animation,

51:40.598 --> 51:45.303
you get to see him in that,
and so that's where the artist

51:45.336 --> 51:48.273
is alive.

51:55.680 --> 51:57.014
[chimes]

51:57.081 --> 52:00.851
-This is it...where
the rubber meets the road.

52:04.889 --> 52:07.858
-[David VO] Wilshire Pig
and the licensable characters

52:07.892 --> 52:10.495
weren't that
interesting to the animators.

52:10.528 --> 52:11.429
-What's that?

52:11.496 --> 52:12.530
[screams]

52:12.563 --> 52:15.032
[pins clatter]

52:15.500 --> 52:16.667
-[David VO]
More talking animals;

52:16.701 --> 52:17.768
Warner Brothers and
Disney already covered

52:17.835 --> 52:19.069
that pretty thoroughly.

52:19.103 --> 52:22.373
Is there something
else we could do?

52:22.673 --> 52:26.377
-[Webster VO] The
ideas just weren't progressing.

52:27.212 --> 52:29.914
-Test results...inconclusive.

52:29.947 --> 52:31.716
[snorts]

52:31.749 --> 52:33.251
Aw, dang!

52:33.284 --> 52:34.919
Why does it keep
happening to me?

52:34.952 --> 52:37.588
This should've worked!

52:37.622 --> 52:39.224
-[Webster VO] People
just stopped giving a shit

52:39.257 --> 52:40.858
because they were just so
disenchanted with what was

52:40.891 --> 52:42.927
going on.

52:42.960 --> 52:45.930
Important people
started to leave the studio.

52:46.697 --> 52:49.133
-It was reaching that point
where you finally realized how

52:49.234 --> 52:53.604
much work you were doing, and
you weren't getting credit for

52:53.638 --> 52:56.541
all the man hours
you were putting in.

53:02.247 --> 53:05.015
-[Bill VO] He felt
it important --sometimes -- to

53:05.049 --> 53:08.353
overlook some of the credit that
should perhaps have been given

53:08.386 --> 53:12.657
to many of the talented
people actually making the work.

53:14.124 --> 53:16.827
-He would actually say,
"It's Will Vinton Studios.

53:16.861 --> 53:21.866
We're all successful," but I do
think he also had that personal

53:22.733 --> 53:25.903
drive that he himself
wanted to be seen as the

53:25.970 --> 53:28.873
driving creative force.

53:28.906 --> 53:30.308
[electricity sparks]

53:30.341 --> 53:32.710
-[Bill VO] Certainly
Walt Disney did a great job of

53:32.743 --> 53:36.547
forging that visionary
personalization of his own name

53:36.581 --> 53:38.316
as a brand itself.

53:38.349 --> 53:40.318
[claps]

53:40.351 --> 53:42.887
-[in Mickey Mouse voice]
Hey Pluto, here she comes!

53:42.920 --> 53:46.524
-The general perception was Walt
Disney drew every comic book,

53:46.557 --> 53:49.927
made every short film and
feature film -- in fact the

53:49.994 --> 53:53.331
studio perpetuated that myth.

53:53.364 --> 53:56.066
Of course that's why
the signature is the logo.

53:56.100 --> 54:00.405
He was an artist and
he signed his artwork.

54:00.738 --> 54:04.141
But when the artist looks
at Walt Disney to emulate,

54:04.174 --> 54:07.845
that usually doesn't
work out too well.

54:07.912 --> 54:10.080
-People resented that
he had these big goals,

54:10.114 --> 54:12.617
and yet at the ground level
where we were working on stuff,

54:12.650 --> 54:15.786
we just didn't
like it that much.

54:15.820 --> 54:18.088
-Here's some Raisin news
right off the press for you;

54:18.122 --> 54:20.958
starting this fall the
California Raisins will be added

54:20.991 --> 54:23.193
to the Saturday
morning cartoon lineup.

54:23.328 --> 54:25.129
Will Vinton will
produce the show.

54:25.162 --> 54:28.999
It won't be done in
Claymation, but cel animation.

54:29.033 --> 54:31.669
-*It's the
California Raisin Show!*

54:31.702 --> 54:34.872
-That really was
against our grain,

54:34.939 --> 54:37.842
because it was Saturday morning,
because it really was kind of

54:37.875 --> 54:39.344
for kids.

54:39.344 --> 54:42.212
-And so it was
less than a success.

54:42.347 --> 54:44.549
-Whenever you get
really successful --

54:44.615 --> 54:46.817
we were kind of the
flavor of the month --

54:46.851 --> 54:49.219
you go out of fashion.

54:49.354 --> 54:52.657
*melancholy piano music

54:52.690 --> 54:56.894

were just a flash in the pan.

-[cartoon VO] Ouch!

54:58.629 --> 54:59.697
-[Bill Fiesterman
VO] They were saying,

54:59.730 --> 55:01.165
"There's a lot of
Claymation on TV now,

55:01.198 --> 55:03.434
and advertising agencies are
looking for something that looks

55:03.468 --> 55:05.202
a little different."

55:05.235 --> 55:08.038
***

55:13.411 --> 55:15.946
-You know, I
think we ought to...

55:15.980 --> 55:18.649
I don't wanna put
it in the negative.

55:18.716 --> 55:22.086
***

55:22.119 --> 55:23.721
-[Will VO] People had
always come to us for something

55:23.754 --> 55:26.657
that was really
unique and creative,

55:26.724 --> 55:30.961
but people were starting to
say we were all about raisins.

55:30.995 --> 55:34.565
Suddenly there was this kind of
myopic sense about what we do as

55:34.599 --> 55:38.403
filmmakers, and that was tough
for me -- a double-edged sword,

55:38.403 --> 55:40.805
as they say.

55:42.072 --> 55:47.077
-The whole Claymation look
had kind of run its course,

55:47.177 --> 55:52.182
and it dropped out of style,
and the studios fell on pretty

55:52.417 --> 55:54.519
hard times.

55:54.585 --> 55:56.987
-Despite our
limitations as artists,

55:57.021 --> 56:00.491
and our foibles like not
wanting to lay anybody off,

56:00.525 --> 56:04.662
period -- which is just totally
a non-concept when it comes to

56:04.695 --> 56:06.497
proper business -- you
don't have the work,

56:06.531 --> 56:09.667
get rid of people, you know,
it's the mantra -- it wasn't

56:09.700 --> 56:12.770
even considered.

56:13.037 --> 56:16.441
-They were having a really hard
time getting commercial work,

56:16.507 --> 56:21.245
and there was very little
demand for what they were doing.

56:21.278 --> 56:26.283
Will saw the logic in expanding
their look and style and tools.

56:28.453 --> 56:31.689
-[Will VO] When I
first picked up clay...

56:31.722 --> 56:36.226
while the material was crude,
lumpy, didn't stand up straight,

56:36.260 --> 56:38.563
rather quickly, I
could really see that the

56:38.596 --> 56:41.031
possibilities were phenomenal.

56:41.065 --> 56:42.967
I feel that we're in
exactly the same place

56:43.033 --> 56:45.470
with computer animation.

56:45.470 --> 56:47.705
-[Chris VO] Computer
animation was brand new.

56:47.738 --> 56:52.042
There had yet to be a
computer-animated movie and

56:52.076 --> 56:55.279
computer animation was
just kind of a novelty.

56:55.312 --> 56:57.815
-We really did
embrace the digital tools,

56:57.882 --> 56:59.950
thinking this could
really bring some new energy,

56:59.984 --> 57:02.920
some new life, some new ways
to bring to life characters.

57:02.953 --> 57:05.690
*funky music

57:05.723 --> 57:09.359
One of the old-time advertisers
that wanted to move into the

57:09.393 --> 57:12.329
digital world was M&M's.

57:12.362 --> 57:15.065
It was a big campaign, and
a lot of production companies

57:15.132 --> 57:16.667
jumped on it.

57:16.701 --> 57:19.904
So we actually had to compete,
but then nobody thought of us as

57:19.970 --> 57:23.407
a computer company at all,
as even having the tools.

57:23.508 --> 57:25.342
And the truth is [whispers] we
didn't really have the tools.

57:25.375 --> 57:26.877
[laughs]

57:26.911 --> 57:28.312
***

57:28.345 --> 57:31.816
Our pitch to them was, "Anybody
can do the 3-D animation.

57:31.849 --> 57:34.519
This is what we'd
like to see you doing.

57:34.552 --> 57:39.557
Name them -- Red, Yellow, Green,
Blue -- give them character,

57:39.857 --> 57:43.728
give them attitude,
give them backstories,

57:43.761 --> 57:46.531
but above all just fill
them full of attitude."

57:46.564 --> 57:50.100
-*Yes it's true, yeah,
we're totally blue*

57:50.167 --> 57:51.736
-I wanna be in this commercial.

57:51.769 --> 57:53.771
-You ain't getting this
job, 'cause you're not blue!

57:53.838 --> 57:54.939
-Great.

57:55.005 --> 57:58.275
-[Will VO] It's so cool
to see the exact same characters

57:58.342 --> 58:03.280
that we pitched have
endured to this day.

58:03.347 --> 58:05.349
-[David VO]
M&M's are a huge story.

58:05.415 --> 58:09.086
They came because Will had
successfully sold the image of

58:09.119 --> 58:10.955
Will Vinton as a creative force.

58:10.988 --> 58:14.024
It's a really really important
pivot because that was a cash

58:14.091 --> 58:18.162
cow and a proving ground for
what the studio could be and

58:18.195 --> 58:21.465
became all throughout the '90s.

58:21.566 --> 58:24.301
-[Chris VO] Everything
shifted during this time period.

58:24.334 --> 58:26.604
They were
sticking in photographs.

58:26.637 --> 58:29.974
They were making characters
out of cardboard flats.

58:30.007 --> 58:33.477
They were experimenting with
all these different materials to

58:33.578 --> 58:37.281
make stop-motion puppets
and different graphic looks.

58:37.314 --> 58:39.584
-Al, I'm wood.

58:39.584 --> 58:41.686
What have I got to lose?

58:41.719 --> 58:43.621
[mechanical whir]

58:43.654 --> 58:47.291
[saws buzz]

58:47.324 --> 58:49.660
Oh, no!

58:49.694 --> 58:51.829
-[Chris VO] In trying
all these different looks,

58:51.862 --> 58:55.499
they really revitalized interest
in the studio and was pretty

58:55.600 --> 58:58.135
successful again.

58:58.168 --> 59:00.404
We kept getting more
and more accounts,

59:00.470 --> 59:03.641
and they started
hiring people like crazy.

59:03.708 --> 59:06.611
Most of the hiring that
they did was for full-time,

59:06.611 --> 59:10.280
full-benefit staff positions.

59:10.314 --> 59:13.751
It exploded in size.

59:15.085 --> 59:17.121
-[Chuck VO] Will was always
supposed to just have a small

59:17.154 --> 59:19.924
group of artists
that love what they do,

59:19.957 --> 59:21.892
and he loved what he did.

59:21.926 --> 59:24.394
I don't think Will
was a businessman.

59:24.428 --> 59:26.731
He was just more of a creator
and an artist and a guy with

59:26.764 --> 59:30.635
ideas, and he had fun at it.

59:31.301 --> 59:32.670
-[Will VO] As
we grew the company,

59:32.737 --> 59:36.106
it was becoming a little less
creatively satisfying for me.

59:36.140 --> 59:40.144
I was doing a lot of stuff that
was not the things that excited

59:40.177 --> 59:44.114
me about being an
artist, about being a creator,

59:44.148 --> 59:49.019
so I was looking for more
creative things that I could do.

59:50.354 --> 59:53.123
-We have a special guest
tonight on Oregon Art Beat,

59:53.157 --> 59:56.293
the man who made
Claymation a household word.

59:56.326 --> 59:58.095
Casey is with Will Vinton.

59:58.128 --> 59:59.296
-That's right, I am.

59:59.296 --> 1:00:01.098
Thank you very much, Mike,
and thank you for joining us.

1:00:01.131 --> 1:00:02.199
-Oh, a pleasure.

1:00:02.266 --> 1:00:03.768
-[Casey] We've got some
tape that shows a little bit of

1:00:03.801 --> 1:00:04.835
the process.

1:00:04.869 --> 1:00:06.470
Why don't we roll that
tape so we can see it,

1:00:06.503 --> 1:00:08.806
and you can kind of
narrate it as we go along.

1:00:08.839 --> 1:00:10.607
-[Will VO] What you
see here is Thurgood

1:00:10.641 --> 1:00:14.211
who is in 'The PJs' which
is our television show.

1:00:14.278 --> 1:00:16.313
-What happened is, I
described what the guy was like,

1:00:16.346 --> 1:00:19.183
what his personality was
like, and Will Vinton would go,

1:00:19.216 --> 1:00:21.051
and he'd make up sketches.

1:00:21.118 --> 1:00:23.553
Then once I looked at him, then
I'd come up with a voice that

1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:26.056
looks like what he
would sound like.

1:00:26.123 --> 1:00:27.391
-Hello, projects!

1:00:27.457 --> 1:00:29.894
[cheering]

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:33.330
I am the Reverend
Thurgood Stubbs.

1:00:33.363 --> 1:00:36.300
-I worked very closely
with Eddie to do the pilot,

1:00:36.333 --> 1:00:38.068
and that was fun, and
that was really creative,

1:00:38.135 --> 1:00:41.806
and that was me getting
my feet back into it.

1:00:41.839 --> 1:00:43.874
[helicopter sounds]

1:00:43.908 --> 1:00:45.142
-I can't take this anymore!

1:00:45.175 --> 1:00:47.211
I can't take it!

1:00:47.244 --> 1:00:50.247
-But not as satisfying for
for me personally as doing

1:00:50.314 --> 1:00:51.749
my own thing.

1:00:51.816 --> 1:00:52.917
-[Casey] What can we look
forward to seeing from you in

1:00:52.983 --> 1:00:54.184
the future?

1:00:54.251 --> 1:00:56.353
-We have another show that'll be
launching called 'Gary & Mike'

1:00:56.386 --> 1:00:59.356
that's gonna run on
Fox through the summer.

1:00:59.389 --> 1:01:02.026
-There ain't nothing but
open road from here on out.

1:01:02.059 --> 1:01:03.427
[car sputters]

1:01:03.493 --> 1:01:05.763
-[Will VO] We
really scaled it up.

1:01:05.796 --> 1:01:09.066
We did 13 half-hour
shows of 'The PJs'--

1:01:09.099 --> 1:01:11.601
-Don't worry.
I know exactly what I'm doing.

1:01:11.635 --> 1:01:13.403
Whoops! [grunts]

1:01:13.437 --> 1:01:15.472
-[Will VO]
Eight of 'Gary & Mike'--

1:01:15.505 --> 1:01:16.741
-Good luck!

1:01:16.741 --> 1:01:19.443
-You're the one
who's gonna need it!

1:01:19.476 --> 1:01:24.481
-80 or 90 major commercials,
all in a year's time.

1:01:24.648 --> 1:01:28.518
They also were
significant revenue generators,

1:01:28.585 --> 1:01:31.956
but I was
definitely into a new mode.

1:01:31.989 --> 1:01:36.326
I'm not the
filmmaker-entrepreneur at all.

1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:40.530
It was kind of a beast with
a life of its own that didn't

1:01:40.597 --> 1:01:43.533
really equal me so much anymore.

1:01:43.600 --> 1:01:45.202
-When you started, you
were a very small shop,

1:01:45.269 --> 1:01:46.771
and now -- I think you were
telling me -- you have three

1:01:46.804 --> 1:01:48.172
buildings in northwest Portland?

1:01:48.205 --> 1:01:49.840
-[Will VO] Yeah,
we have three buildings,

1:01:49.874 --> 1:01:51.108
sometimes four.

1:01:51.141 --> 1:01:52.877
-[Casey VO] And how
much of a staff now?

1:01:52.943 --> 1:01:55.813
-[Will VO] Well over 300
artists and animators and

1:01:55.846 --> 1:01:57.647
staff-people.

1:01:57.681 --> 1:02:00.284
-Well, we'll be seeing lots
of you as the years go by.

1:02:00.317 --> 1:02:02.552
Will, thank you so much for
joining us on Oregon Art Beat.

1:02:02.619 --> 1:02:03.888
-My pleasure.

1:02:03.921 --> 1:02:05.189
*"You've Got a Friend
in Me" by Randy Newman*

1:02:05.222 --> 1:02:07.024
-[Charlie VO] 'Toy Story'
made history last year as the

1:02:07.057 --> 1:02:10.060
first
computer-generated feature film.

1:02:10.094 --> 1:02:13.030
Joining me now,
Pixar's chairman and CEO,

1:02:13.063 --> 1:02:14.799
Steve Jobs.

1:02:14.865 --> 1:02:17.935
-We're about putting
stories into the culture,

1:02:17.968 --> 1:02:19.636
that's what we're--
We're about telling stories.

1:02:19.703 --> 1:02:20.805
And you know--

1:02:20.838 --> 1:02:22.206
-I'm gonna come back and
interview you in five years and

1:02:22.239 --> 1:02:25.375
find out you're in some other
business and you found some

1:02:25.409 --> 1:02:26.610
other well to go fishing in?

1:02:26.643 --> 1:02:29.313
-You know, I tend to stay
where I start until somebody

1:02:29.379 --> 1:02:30.480
kicks me out.

1:02:30.547 --> 1:02:32.817
[laughter]

1:02:32.883 --> 1:02:35.585
-[Will VO] Steve Jobs seemed
to have an interest in us

1:02:35.619 --> 1:02:38.155
as a television organization.

1:02:38.222 --> 1:02:41.125
After quite a bit of due
diligence between the companies,

1:02:41.158 --> 1:02:44.829
they came back and floated the
idea that Pixar would purchase

1:02:44.829 --> 1:02:49.834
us and purchase all of
my stock for Pixar stock.

1:02:50.835 --> 1:02:53.137
I'm going, "Well, what-
you know, okay, I'm sitting on

1:02:53.170 --> 1:02:56.173
millions of shares of Will
Vinton Studios stock and there's

1:02:56.240 --> 1:02:59.276
this company called Pixar,
so I'd be trading that for

1:02:59.309 --> 1:03:02.612
millions of shares or
something of this Pixar stock,"

1:03:02.646 --> 1:03:05.382
and basically just
rejected it out of hand.

1:03:05.415 --> 1:03:09.887
Well, jump forward
about [laughs] 10/15 years.

1:03:09.920 --> 1:03:14.191
If I had taken that deal, I'd be
probably arguably be one of the

1:03:14.224 --> 1:03:16.660
largest, maybe the
largest shareholder of Disney.

1:03:16.693 --> 1:03:19.063
[laughs]

1:03:20.865 --> 1:03:23.233
-[man] You've been a
businessman for many years.

1:03:23.267 --> 1:03:25.102
-[laughs]

1:03:25.169 --> 1:03:26.536
Of sorts.

1:03:26.570 --> 1:03:30.407
-Why did you step
down as CEO in 1997?

1:03:30.440 --> 1:03:35.112
-I really wanted to get back to
doing what I had always-- what I

1:03:35.179 --> 1:03:39.249
used to do, which was more
development and directing and

1:03:39.283 --> 1:03:42.452
focus on that, on
the creative side.

1:03:42.519 --> 1:03:46.690
-[Will VO] I was really eager to
get back into being a director,

1:03:46.723 --> 1:03:51.228
and I was kind of ready
to shed responsibility.

1:03:51.261 --> 1:03:54.932
I ended up deciding that I
really did need to bring in a

1:03:54.965 --> 1:03:59.269
CEO that could come in and
handle the business side.

1:04:01.738 --> 1:04:04.141
We actually came up with a
guy that I thought the world of

1:04:04.174 --> 1:04:05.910
named Tom Turpin.

1:04:05.910 --> 1:04:08.545
-[David VO] Tom Turpin
was a Gentleman's Quarterly

1:04:08.612 --> 1:04:11.515
version of your
ideal CEO candidate.

1:04:11.548 --> 1:04:14.118
He looked good, he
could say the right things,

1:04:14.151 --> 1:04:19.023
he was always very
warm in a Hollywood way.

1:04:19.056 --> 1:04:22.927
-People were leery when Tom
Turpin started because he was

1:04:22.960 --> 1:04:27.064
just this dashing,
charming, fast-talking guy.

1:04:28.032 --> 1:04:30.067
And Will just loved him.

1:04:30.134 --> 1:04:33.703
We were like, "The guy just
says whatever you want to hear."

1:04:33.737 --> 1:04:35.305
-Are you ready to make your
wildest dreams come true?

1:04:35.339 --> 1:04:36.806
Of course you are!

1:04:36.840 --> 1:04:38.008
-Whoa!

1:04:38.008 --> 1:04:41.946
-I actually joined April 1st,
1997 -- April Fools Day --

1:04:41.946 --> 1:04:42.947
and I dug it.

1:04:42.980 --> 1:04:45.049
I just thought it
was a cool place, very cool.

1:04:45.082 --> 1:04:47.151
The ad division was
really a cash cow,

1:04:47.184 --> 1:04:48.752
and it really covered
a lot of the overhead,

1:04:48.818 --> 1:04:50.754
so when the TV shows
came in, they started making

1:04:50.820 --> 1:04:51.956
a lot of money.

1:04:51.956 --> 1:04:53.958
We actually made a lot of money.

1:04:53.958 --> 1:04:56.426
-[Will VO] One of the things
that our CEO felt we should do

1:04:56.493 --> 1:04:58.095
is raise capital.

1:04:58.162 --> 1:05:00.430
Well, that's a completely
different concept than what we

1:05:00.497 --> 1:05:01.531
had ever had.

1:05:01.598 --> 1:05:03.433
You know, what are we
gonna do with this capital?

1:05:03.500 --> 1:05:06.236
And of course the mantra was,
"You raise capital when you

1:05:06.270 --> 1:05:07.237
don't need it."

1:05:07.271 --> 1:05:10.640
[laughing] Oh, okay, all right.

1:05:10.674 --> 1:05:13.978
I think that
sounds right. [laughs]

1:05:13.978 --> 1:05:17.281
-[man] Take a look
at exhibit four, please.

1:05:18.582 --> 1:05:20.017
-[Tom VO] Phil, I
couldn't think of a more

1:05:20.084 --> 1:05:22.586
prestigious investor than that.

1:05:22.619 --> 1:05:26.290
We reminded him of when he was
at the beginning of his career,

1:05:26.323 --> 1:05:28.993
and there was
something fun in that for him.

1:05:28.993 --> 1:05:32.296
Company like Nike is so big;
it just turns into a monster

1:05:32.329 --> 1:05:35.299
business, and your
role changes, right?

1:05:35.332 --> 1:05:38.835
He just remembered that
kind of entrepreneurial juice,

1:05:38.868 --> 1:05:42.706
and he saw it in us
-- let's just do it.

1:05:43.107 --> 1:05:47.511
For $5,000,000, Phil acquired
15 percent of the company.

1:05:47.544 --> 1:05:50.114
-[man] I heard you got offered
five million bucks to do one of

1:05:50.147 --> 1:05:52.482
those tennis shoe
ads, is that true?

1:05:52.516 --> 1:05:55.652
-Whoa, $5,000,000?

1:05:55.685 --> 1:05:58.022
-I still liked the idea
of getting in the feature

1:05:58.055 --> 1:05:59.789
film business.

1:05:59.823 --> 1:06:01.025
-[Tom VO] To
move into features,

1:06:01.025 --> 1:06:03.527
you need to have a
deep pocket behind you.

1:06:03.560 --> 1:06:08.098
Pixar had Steve Jobs, and
now Vinton has Phil Knight.

1:06:08.132 --> 1:06:10.134
-[Jeffrey VO] I can't think
that any other business that

1:06:10.200 --> 1:06:12.069
he's invested in is stayed.

1:06:12.102 --> 1:06:16.706
It was totally out of
character for Phil to do that.

1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:20.644
Knight had so much money; it was
going to be a great partnership.

1:06:23.447 --> 1:06:26.616
-[Will VO] Having built this
company, and 25 years later I

1:06:26.650 --> 1:06:30.587
actually was looking at a kind
of exit strategy to slip into a

1:06:30.620 --> 1:06:35.625
different role and allow me
the time to do my own projects.

1:06:36.226 --> 1:06:38.395
-[Tom VO] I think that
Will's real dream was to be

1:06:38.428 --> 1:06:40.397
making feature films.

1:06:40.430 --> 1:06:42.766
[chimes]

1:06:42.799 --> 1:06:46.736
-[man VO] Will Vinton Features
presents 'The Frog Prince.'

1:06:47.071 --> 1:06:50.907
-We've taken the timeless appeal
of the Brothers Grimm story and

1:06:50.940 --> 1:06:54.844
made it into this
expansive, magical,

1:06:54.911 --> 1:06:58.415
emotionally
engaging musical comedy.

1:06:58.448 --> 1:07:03.453
-He was so optimistic and
excited and enthusiastic about

1:07:03.920 --> 1:07:06.090
everything that he did.

1:07:06.090 --> 1:07:09.359
Not only were we gonna have
'Gary & Mike' and 'The PJs'

1:07:09.393 --> 1:07:14.398
running, but we had three
pilots that were in production.

1:07:14.431 --> 1:07:17.334
And at the same time, it was
looking like some of these

1:07:17.367 --> 1:07:20.737
feature films were gonna
happen; 'Corpse Bride' started

1:07:20.770 --> 1:07:23.107
to happen.

1:07:24.208 --> 1:07:29.179
It felt like all of
Will's dreams were coming true.

1:07:31.415 --> 1:07:36.420
-Mr. Knight had been a
shareholder since 1998, correct?

1:07:37.187 --> 1:07:38.288
-Correct.

1:07:38.355 --> 1:07:40.124
-[man] And he had been
very hands-off, hadn't he?

1:07:40.190 --> 1:07:41.291
-Yes, that's correct.

1:07:41.358 --> 1:07:44.261
-And his son had been an
employee from about that same

1:07:44.294 --> 1:07:46.029
point in time, correct?

1:07:46.130 --> 1:07:48.565
-That was one of the things
that Phil wanted as part of that

1:07:48.598 --> 1:07:52.269
first investment was for his
son to have employment there.

1:07:52.302 --> 1:07:55.939
*moody ambient music

1:07:55.972 --> 1:07:58.208
-Phil Knight just said,
"I have a son who's in the

1:07:58.242 --> 1:07:59.309
creative world.

1:07:59.376 --> 1:08:01.711

he's rapping now."

own state-of-the-art recording

studio and indoor
tennis and basketball courts,

1:08:18.828 --> 1:08:21.965
all this millionaire homeboy
really wants is to have his very

1:08:21.998 --> 1:08:24.168
own posse.

1:08:24.201 --> 1:08:26.970
I mean what's your response to
the kind of support or lack of

1:08:27.003 --> 1:08:28.672
support you've
had from Portland?

1:08:28.705 --> 1:08:30.374
-A lot of people have
a problem with me just because

1:08:30.407 --> 1:08:32.242
they think I'm tryin' to front
or tryin' to fake or tryin' to

1:08:32.309 --> 1:08:33.510
be Black or whatever.

1:08:33.543 --> 1:08:35.078
Think I'm tryin' to
be something I'm not.

1:08:35.179 --> 1:08:36.713
-[man] So you're kind of
like a homeboy without a posse

1:08:36.746 --> 1:08:38.182
in a way.

1:08:38.215 --> 1:08:39.649
-Yeah pretty much.

1:08:39.683 --> 1:08:43.753
-Any young person, especially
any young son of a really

1:08:43.820 --> 1:08:48.525
successful wealthy person, it's
a struggle to find an identity,

1:08:48.558 --> 1:08:52.762
and Will hasn't
wished to be a great rapper.

1:08:52.829 --> 1:08:56.400
But he found his niche and he
went to work for the company

1:08:56.433 --> 1:08:58.235
that his dad's invested in.

1:08:58.268 --> 1:08:59.669
[record scratches]

1:08:59.703 --> 1:09:01.338
-[Tom VO] He
started like everybody started.

1:09:01.371 --> 1:09:03.673
You don't need to know anything;
come and sweep the floors,

1:09:03.707 --> 1:09:05.242
see if you like it.

1:09:05.275 --> 1:09:08.278
Will and I thought the best way
to support Travis is not to tell

1:09:08.312 --> 1:09:10.647
anybody that Phil
Knight's his dad.

1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:13.517
I don't think anybody
knew for three years.

1:09:13.583 --> 1:09:15.352
-To Travis's credit,
he seemed to really,

1:09:15.419 --> 1:09:18.955
really love the animation
and took to it right away.

1:09:18.988 --> 1:09:22.759
-[man] What are your goals
or plans as far as Travis's

1:09:22.792 --> 1:09:24.428
involvement in the company?

1:09:24.461 --> 1:09:25.929
-Well they're not my
plans; they're his plans,

1:09:25.962 --> 1:09:30.634
that essentially his
plan is to be an animator.

1:09:30.667 --> 1:09:32.469
That's what he loves doing.

1:09:32.502 --> 1:09:35.805
He doesn't have management
ambition at the present time.

1:09:35.839 --> 1:09:37.974
He doesn't even want to be a
director at the present time.

1:09:38.007 --> 1:09:40.644
He wants to be an animator,
which he's very good at.

1:09:40.677 --> 1:09:44.681
*moody ambient music

1:09:44.714 --> 1:09:47.150
-[Chris VO] Will's
enthusiasm was the company's

1:09:47.251 --> 1:09:50.287
greatest asset and
probably the greatest danger.

1:09:52.256 --> 1:09:56.826
Both Tom Turpin and Will Vinton
were just raving and so excited

1:09:56.860 --> 1:09:58.662
about what was happening.

1:09:58.695 --> 1:10:01.064
And there were all
these dreams and goals,

1:10:01.130 --> 1:10:03.500
but they never
seemed to have a plan B.

1:10:03.533 --> 1:10:05.669
You know, what are you
gonna do if it doesn't happen?

1:10:05.702 --> 1:10:07.304
He's like, "It'll happen."

1:10:07.337 --> 1:10:12.041
-When Tom Turpin came in, it
became a very corporate place.

1:10:12.075 --> 1:10:15.479
The whole structure -- the
feeling -- was different.

1:10:15.512 --> 1:10:18.315
I would say it was a
completely different company.

1:10:18.348 --> 1:10:23.019
-The "MBA" approach to CEO is
as all-powerful management,

1:10:23.052 --> 1:10:25.221
we know best.

1:10:25.255 --> 1:10:30.193
-[man] Why was Mr.
Turpin's contract not renewed?

1:10:30.226 --> 1:10:34.998
-Primarily because
of his performance.

1:10:35.031 --> 1:10:38.602
As Tom's policies
began to take effect,

1:10:38.668 --> 1:10:41.505
we started losing money and
started spending an awful lot

1:10:41.538 --> 1:10:43.106
of money.

1:10:43.172 --> 1:10:45.709
-[David VO] Tom Turpin
wasn't making great decisions.

1:10:45.742 --> 1:10:48.845
A lot of money was being thrown
in a lot of stupid places.

1:10:48.878 --> 1:10:51.948
There's the legend of the
million dollar escalator.

1:10:52.015 --> 1:10:54.684
They had rented two levels
of an office in an LA to look

1:10:54.718 --> 1:10:58.254
impressive as they were
seducing and wooing studios.

1:10:58.288 --> 1:11:01.691
Tom had the great idea to put
in an escalator between the two

1:11:01.725 --> 1:11:04.060
floors because it would
be a dramatic entrance,

1:11:04.093 --> 1:11:07.364
sort of like going up the
escalator to creative heaven at

1:11:07.431 --> 1:11:10.767
Will Vinton's
Hollywood swanky pad.

1:11:11.801 --> 1:11:14.938
-[man] When was
'The PJs' cancelled?

1:11:14.971 --> 1:11:16.806
-It was the early part of 2001.

1:11:16.840 --> 1:11:19.042
-What was the name of the
other television series?

1:11:19.108 --> 1:11:20.344
-'Gary & Mike.'

1:11:20.344 --> 1:11:23.547
-And when did it
cease being on TV?

1:11:23.613 --> 1:11:26.350
-I believe it was right
around the same time.

1:11:26.350 --> 1:11:28.184
-[Tom VO] TV
shows get cancelled.

1:11:28.217 --> 1:11:31.521
These TV shows were like
two-thirds of our revenue --

1:11:31.555 --> 1:11:34.358
$10,000,000-a-year projects --
and then if they go away it's

1:11:34.358 --> 1:11:37.361
like, "Boom,
$10,000,000 is gone."

1:11:37.361 --> 1:11:40.964
-The pilots -- one by one
-- don't get picked up,

1:11:40.997 --> 1:11:43.867
and then the feature films
they've been talking about,

1:11:43.900 --> 1:11:47.003
none of those come to fruition.

1:11:47.036 --> 1:11:49.406
And then everything
started to come apart.

1:11:49.473 --> 1:11:53.176
-How would you describe the
financial condition of Will

1:11:53.209 --> 1:11:58.047
Vinton Studios during
the spring of 2002?

1:11:58.081 --> 1:12:01.651
-It was [clears throat]
struggling, not good.

1:12:01.685 --> 1:12:03.853
-[Melissa VO] We have
to support all these people,

1:12:03.887 --> 1:12:07.090
and suddenly your
money-making machine stops,

1:12:07.123 --> 1:12:08.492
but you're
still spending money,

1:12:08.558 --> 1:12:11.160
you're literally bleeding money.

1:12:11.227 --> 1:12:12.762
-If it had been Hollywood,
it would have been a totally

1:12:12.796 --> 1:12:15.565
different deal, because all of
these guys would have been on

1:12:15.599 --> 1:12:18.435
contract -- they would have been
temporary workers -- and the

1:12:18.468 --> 1:12:21.838
minute the work went
away, they would be gone.

1:12:21.905 --> 1:12:26.910
-Was it in that context that the
company approached Phil Knight

1:12:27.243 --> 1:12:31.314
about a possible
additional investment?

1:12:31.415 --> 1:12:33.116
-Yes.

1:12:33.149 --> 1:12:36.252
-He had an army of really smart
businesspeople putting together

1:12:36.285 --> 1:12:38.622
the contracts to
protect his investment.

1:12:38.655 --> 1:12:40.524
There were stacks
like this of contracts,

1:12:40.590 --> 1:12:42.125
you know, that I
didn't even read,

1:12:42.158 --> 1:12:43.960
you know, when we
probably signed up the thing.

1:12:43.993 --> 1:12:46.095
-When you want a loan, there's
only one person you need to

1:12:46.129 --> 1:12:48.264
see--
[quirky sound effect]

1:12:48.297 --> 1:12:49.666
The Brains.

1:12:49.699 --> 1:12:51.801
-It was not an
investment I wanted to make.

1:12:51.835 --> 1:12:54.003
It was not a good
economic investment,

1:12:54.037 --> 1:12:55.439
in my view.

1:12:55.439 --> 1:12:58.141
Will Vinton seemed to me to
be trying to commit suicide for

1:12:58.174 --> 1:12:59.809
the company.

1:12:59.843 --> 1:13:03.146
-He thought that Phil Knight
would be a benign benefactor who

1:13:03.179 --> 1:13:05.682
knew the shoe business.
[laughs]

1:13:05.715 --> 1:13:08.184
I remember Will saying to
me, "There's no business like

1:13:08.217 --> 1:13:09.619
shoe business."

1:13:09.686 --> 1:13:11.521
***

1:13:11.555 --> 1:13:15.058
-I was aware of the fact
that if we had a downturn,

1:13:15.091 --> 1:13:18.061
that he would be able to
take certain kind of control.

1:13:18.094 --> 1:13:20.597
But we'd been
profitable 23 years out of 25,

1:13:20.630 --> 1:13:23.366
so what was I worried about?

1:13:23.467 --> 1:13:28.271
-Do you remember him telling
you that if he was to make an

1:13:28.304 --> 1:13:33.309
additional investment, that he
would drive a very hard bargain?

1:13:33.877 --> 1:13:35.244
-[Will] Yes.

1:13:35.278 --> 1:13:38.114
-Do you think Mr.
Knight drove a hard bargain?

1:13:38.147 --> 1:13:39.816
-Sure, absolutely.

1:13:39.883 --> 1:13:43.386
-He was driving a
very hard bargain, correct?

1:13:43.487 --> 1:13:44.654
-[Will] That's correct.

1:13:44.721 --> 1:13:47.724
Could I get a little
more water, or-- could I?

1:13:47.757 --> 1:13:50.494
-[man VO] Phil Knight versus
Will Vinton was sort of like the

1:13:50.494 --> 1:13:52.796
great white
shark versus a guppy.

1:13:52.829 --> 1:13:55.832
[water bubbles]

1:13:55.899 --> 1:13:57.501
-[Melissa VO]
Will must've been somewhat

1:13:57.567 --> 1:14:01.070
blindsided, or maybe didn't
understand that Phil Knight

1:14:01.104 --> 1:14:03.406
would play hardball with him.

1:14:03.507 --> 1:14:08.512
-Were you aware at the time you
signed the employment agreement

1:14:09.546 --> 1:14:14.551
that it authorized your
termination without cause?

1:14:14.718 --> 1:14:18.087
***

1:14:18.154 --> 1:14:19.823
-Sure.

1:14:19.856 --> 1:14:24.861
-Did you have an understanding
what "without cause" meant?

1:14:26.563 --> 1:14:29.733
-Um, a basic
understanding, I guess.

1:14:29.766 --> 1:14:33.436
-Did you understand that
it meant any reason or no reason

1:14:33.537 --> 1:14:36.439
at all?

1:14:36.540 --> 1:14:38.608
-[laughs]

1:14:40.443 --> 1:14:42.011
-[Will VO] Now we're
into some really heavy-duty

1:14:42.045 --> 1:14:43.446
business stuff.

1:14:43.547 --> 1:14:47.083
The company's losing money,
and we had a lot of commitments.

1:14:47.116 --> 1:14:50.887
-[Tom VO] They were
hemorrhaging money like crazy.

1:14:51.454 --> 1:14:55.892
-In business, the best deals
are kind of win-win deals.

1:14:55.925 --> 1:14:58.562
That's not the way
they liked to play.

1:14:58.595 --> 1:15:01.765
If somebody's winning,
that means you're losing.

1:15:01.798 --> 1:15:05.669
-[Jeffrey VO] Phil Knight slowly
started taking possession.

1:15:05.702 --> 1:15:10.707
He acquired a lot of it
without Will knowing about it.

1:15:10.840 --> 1:15:15.378
Phil Knight soon had a
majority of the stock.

1:15:17.213 --> 1:15:19.716
-[man VO] Why were you
interested of taking voting

1:15:19.783 --> 1:15:21.851
control of the company?

1:15:21.885 --> 1:15:24.487
-I had to get
something for my investment.

1:15:24.588 --> 1:15:26.690
If it had just been the
economics of the situation,

1:15:26.723 --> 1:15:28.692
I would never have done it.

1:15:28.725 --> 1:15:30.994
But I had a son that worked
there that loved the company,

1:15:31.027 --> 1:15:33.462
that loved his job, loved
the people he worked with,

1:15:33.496 --> 1:15:36.465
had a chance to work with Tim
Burton -- who's probably the

1:15:36.499 --> 1:15:39.368
ultimate in terms of
animation, creative,

1:15:39.402 --> 1:15:43.840
respect, and talent -- and I
concluded that I would try and

1:15:43.873 --> 1:15:46.876
keep the company alive.

1:15:47.043 --> 1:15:51.047
Why on earth did you
not just say thank you?

1:15:55.752 --> 1:15:58.487
-[man] At this point in time,
had you resigned yourself to the

1:15:58.521 --> 1:16:03.326
fact that your days were
numbered at Will Vinton Studios?

1:16:03.359 --> 1:16:07.063
-I really couldn't believe
that would be an outcome of

1:16:07.096 --> 1:16:08.965
this business.

1:16:08.998 --> 1:16:12.802
Nobody in their right mind
would lay off the founder of the

1:16:12.836 --> 1:16:17.841
company and the rainmaker
for most of the business,

1:16:17.907 --> 1:16:22.912
except somebody who had other
motives and some deep pocket to

1:16:23.079 --> 1:16:26.249
back it up and go
somewhere else with it.

1:16:26.983 --> 1:16:31.955
It was clear that Phil had made
up his mind that he was going to

1:16:31.988 --> 1:16:33.657
take that company.

1:16:33.657 --> 1:16:35.358
[clamoring]

1:16:35.424 --> 1:16:36.793

from your employment at Will

1:16:44.433 --> 1:16:45.835
Vinton Studios?

1:16:45.869 --> 1:16:49.505
-[sighs] Yes, I was.

1:16:53.309 --> 1:16:58.314
-What is the factual basis for
your assertion that Phil Knight

1:16:58.682 --> 1:17:03.519
wanted to take control of this
company to turn the company over

1:17:03.552 --> 1:17:05.554
to Travis Knight?

1:17:05.588 --> 1:17:10.593
-Well, the fact that
Phil requested Travis's

1:17:10.860 --> 1:17:12.929
employment way back.

1:17:12.962 --> 1:17:17.266
The fact that Travis stayed
a part of the organization,

1:17:17.300 --> 1:17:22.405
you know, the Chilly
Tee fiasco happened.

1:17:22.471 --> 1:17:25.942
Which I suspect that this was a
little more compatible way to

1:17:25.975 --> 1:17:29.078
use money to get
into the business.

1:17:29.112 --> 1:17:31.580
Heck, it's hard to imagine
any other motivation,

1:17:31.614 --> 1:17:34.383
to be frank.

1:17:34.583 --> 1:17:37.153
-[Jeffrey VO] There
are these issues of nepotism.

1:17:37.220 --> 1:17:40.223
There are these issues of,
"Did Phil Knight take advantage

1:17:40.256 --> 1:17:42.091
of Will?"

1:17:42.125 --> 1:17:43.927
*dark string music

1:17:43.960 --> 1:17:47.563
This collision of Phil Knight
and Will Vinton -- creativity

1:17:47.596 --> 1:17:50.734
versus commerce --
they were at odds,

1:17:50.734 --> 1:17:53.402
and...

1:17:53.436 --> 1:17:57.841
Will came out the
loser of that battle.

1:17:57.907 --> 1:18:01.978
-[man] You're aware that
you're entitled to a termination

payment, correct?

1:18:03.813 --> 1:18:04.981
-Yes.

1:18:05.014 --> 1:18:07.050
-You got the $50,000, correct?

1:18:07.083 --> 1:18:08.084
-[Will] That's correct.

1:18:08.151 --> 1:18:10.586
-You never got the
$150,000, isn't that right?

1:18:10.653 --> 1:18:11.888
-[Will] That's correct.

1:18:11.955 --> 1:18:15.424
-And that's because one of those
conditions was that the 'Corpse

1:18:15.491 --> 1:18:19.195
Bride' contract be
signed, correct?

1:18:19.228 --> 1:18:20.997
-[laughs] Yes.

1:18:21.030 --> 1:18:24.768
-Was it only coincidental that
the 'Corpse Bride' contract was

1:18:24.768 --> 1:18:27.904
signed the day after Mr.
Vinton's was terminated?

1:18:27.937 --> 1:18:29.939
-Yes.

1:18:30.006 --> 1:18:34.177
-[Jeffrey VO] He walked
away with $50,000 for a lifetime

1:18:34.210 --> 1:18:37.513
of artistic and
creative struggle.

1:18:37.546 --> 1:18:39.949
That's ridiculous.

1:18:40.016 --> 1:18:42.786
-[Michele VO] There was
no need to do that mean stuff.

1:18:42.786 --> 1:18:47.523
They took Claymation, the
name-- they took everything.

1:18:47.556 --> 1:18:49.793
They didn't need to do that.

1:18:49.793 --> 1:18:53.062
I think that's
really "poor paper,"

1:18:53.096 --> 1:18:55.598
as my grandma would say.

1:18:55.631 --> 1:18:59.302
-Are you happier today that
you are no longer employed by

1:18:59.368 --> 1:19:00.970
that company?

1:19:01.037 --> 1:19:05.308
-I absolutely did not
want to leave that company.

1:19:05.341 --> 1:19:08.812
-And you have told the public
or people that you are happier

1:19:08.812 --> 1:19:11.714
today that you're no
longer employed by the company.

1:19:11.815 --> 1:19:16.152
-How could I be happy about
having left the company that I

1:19:16.185 --> 1:19:21.190
built, that I am so close to?

1:19:21.724 --> 1:19:26.662
It was like a family, and I had
my entire net worth wrapped up

1:19:26.695 --> 1:19:28.497
in that company.

1:19:28.531 --> 1:19:31.500
I...

1:19:31.534 --> 1:19:34.470
My...

1:19:42.045 --> 1:19:43.913
Yeah.

1:19:43.980 --> 1:19:45.314
-[man] That's all
I have for today!

1:19:45.348 --> 1:19:47.183
-[laughs]

*"RIP Coyote Condo
#5" by Grandaddy*

1:20:17.513 --> 1:20:20.216
-He just didn't know
what was happening,

1:20:20.249 --> 1:20:22.385
and his studio was just gone.

1:20:22.418 --> 1:20:26.689
***

1:20:35.198 --> 1:20:36.599
-[Melissa VO]
The next thing I know,

1:20:36.632 --> 1:20:39.368
Vinton Studios
belongs to Travis Knight,

1:20:39.402 --> 1:20:43.139
and that between
Travis and his father Phil,

1:20:43.206 --> 1:20:44.473
it's Laika.

1:20:44.540 --> 1:20:46.209
-[reporter VO] It's the little
studio that could -- Laika --

1:20:46.242 --> 1:20:47.944
the CEO of the
company is Travis Knight.

1:20:47.977 --> 1:20:50.446
He joins us now
from Portland, Oregon.

1:20:50.479 --> 1:20:51.747
-Something just evolved.

1:20:51.780 --> 1:20:53.816
It was an opportunity that
came up that I-- you know,

1:20:53.883 --> 1:20:55.151
who would think you
could actually make a living

1:20:55.218 --> 1:20:56.252
doing this?

1:20:56.319 --> 1:20:58.587
It does not seem like
it's a plausible life plan,

1:20:58.621 --> 1:21:00.123
but it's
something I always loved.

1:21:00.156 --> 1:21:01.891
And when I had the-- when the
opportunity was presented to me,

1:21:01.925 --> 1:21:05.494
I took it-- I took, you know,
grabbed it and ran with it.

1:21:05.528 --> 1:21:06.495
-[reporter] So was
Laika the opportunity,

1:21:06.529 --> 1:21:07.931
or was there another
thing before that?

1:21:07.964 --> 1:21:11.534
-No, I was-- I worked at another
animation house before then.

1:21:11.567 --> 1:21:16.405
-Travis -- by all accounts -- is
a talented guy and transcended

1:21:16.472 --> 1:21:20.343
any sort of talk that this
was all about finding sonny

1:21:20.376 --> 1:21:22.345
boy a job.

1:21:22.378 --> 1:21:25.514
-[Melissa VO] It's just
sad that Will was able to take

1:21:25.548 --> 1:21:30.153
his dream to a certain point
and was not able to go to that

1:21:30.186 --> 1:21:33.056
next level.

1:21:33.089 --> 1:21:35.558
Somebody else took it there.

1:21:35.591 --> 1:21:37.593
-[Tom VO] For Will to
build it up to this point where

1:21:37.660 --> 1:21:39.695
it got as big as it
was ever gonna get,

1:21:39.728 --> 1:21:43.032
and then ka-blooey,
then lose the thing.

1:21:43.066 --> 1:21:46.435
How could he build all this up
and then it gets taken away?

1:21:46.502 --> 1:21:48.404
-[Chuck VO] It goes
back to the Disney thing.

1:21:48.437 --> 1:21:51.574
It's great that
he had that dream,

1:21:51.607 --> 1:21:53.709
but he couldn't do it.

1:21:53.742 --> 1:21:58.547
It's sort of this Disney
ghost that haunted him.

1:21:58.581 --> 1:22:02.451
-I was all broken up
after he got let go,

1:22:02.518 --> 1:22:07.123
and I went to see him at
a little farewell party.

1:22:07.156 --> 1:22:10.193
He said, "I just feel relief."

1:22:10.259 --> 1:22:13.429
He said, "I've been so worried
about how I'm gonna pay the

1:22:13.462 --> 1:22:18.167
bills, how I'm gonna keep
these people employed."

1:22:18.201 --> 1:22:20.169
-[Craig VO] We hopped
in his motorboat and zoomed into

1:22:20.203 --> 1:22:22.771
Portland up the
Willamette from his house.

1:22:22.805 --> 1:22:24.273
I'm like, "Dude, you're cut."

1:22:24.307 --> 1:22:26.442
And he's just like, [motorboat
sound] in his motorboat,

1:22:26.475 --> 1:22:30.013
and I'm like, "Man, clearly
this guy-- the worst things can

1:22:30.013 --> 1:22:33.382
happen to this guy and
he's gonna bounce back."

1:22:33.449 --> 1:22:35.051
-[Mary VO] He
was never vengeful.

1:22:35.118 --> 1:22:37.186
He was certainly
never self-pitying.

1:22:37.220 --> 1:22:41.890
And I remember him taking a
fair amount of responsibility.

1:22:42.025 --> 1:22:46.529
He made mistakes; yeah,
he made some bad mistakes.

1:22:46.562 --> 1:22:51.367
But the beauty is, when men get
older and they've lost lovers,

1:22:51.400 --> 1:22:55.038
friends,
businesses, they get humble,

1:22:55.038 --> 1:22:58.407
and then the best
of them comes out,

1:22:58.474 --> 1:23:01.410
and the best of what it
means to be a father.

1:23:01.477 --> 1:23:03.379
-[Jesse VO] I did
get to see him a lot more.

1:23:03.412 --> 1:23:06.782
There was a transformation
emotionally in him.

1:23:06.815 --> 1:23:09.052
He knew better than
ever that family was

1:23:09.085 --> 1:23:10.753
the most important thing.

1:23:10.786 --> 1:23:14.590
***

1:23:21.130 --> 1:23:23.499
-[nurse] Okay, so spell
your last name for me.

1:23:23.566 --> 1:23:24.900
-V-I-N-T-O-N.

1:23:24.933 --> 1:23:26.135
-[nurse] Spell your first name.

1:23:26.169 --> 1:23:28.837
-[laughing]
Seeing if I can spell, or what?

1:23:28.904 --> 1:23:32.975
-I gotta do it for the bracelet.
-W-I-L-L-I-A-M.

1:23:33.076 --> 1:23:38.081
Actually it bothers me to
see needles on somebody else,

1:23:38.347 --> 1:23:39.748
or even my dog.

1:23:39.782 --> 1:23:42.118
God, I about passed out
one time when I took my dog

1:23:42.151 --> 1:23:43.586
in for something.

1:23:43.619 --> 1:23:44.687
[both laugh]

1:23:44.753 --> 1:23:46.489
-I was gonna say, this
has never bothered you.

1:23:46.522 --> 1:23:47.990
-[nurse VO] How are
you feeling today?

1:23:48.091 --> 1:23:49.825
-[Will] Kinda
sluggin' around a little bit.

1:23:49.858 --> 1:23:51.127
-[nurse] You have a
transfusion today, right?

1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:53.462
-[Will] Uh, tomorrow.

1:23:53.496 --> 1:23:55.698
-[nurse] Okay,
any pain today?

1:23:55.764 --> 1:23:56.932
-[Will] A little in the back.

1:23:56.965 --> 1:23:58.934
-[nurse] Any change in
medications since we saw

1:23:58.967 --> 1:24:00.969
you last?

1:24:01.003 --> 1:24:03.372
-Maybe dropped the--
I'm a little confused;

1:24:03.439 --> 1:24:06.008
I've got a lot of doctors.

1:24:06.109 --> 1:24:07.276
-[nurse] Pointer...

1:24:07.343 --> 1:24:08.511
So yeah, you
won't be as short

1:24:08.544 --> 1:24:10.779
of breath after
that transfusion.

1:24:10.846 --> 1:24:12.115
Have you had a
transfusion before?

1:24:12.115 --> 1:24:14.783
-Yeah, just-- yeah.

1:24:14.850 --> 1:24:17.686
Not that long ago.

1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:20.856
-You're-- hang on,
you are a pioneer,

1:24:20.889 --> 1:24:23.759
and I'm excited to say that
we're giving you our lifetime

1:24:23.792 --> 1:24:25.128
achievement award.

1:24:25.194 --> 1:24:27.430
[applause]

1:24:27.463 --> 1:24:28.531
-[Will] Thank you everybody.

1:24:28.564 --> 1:24:32.535
[applause]

1:24:33.202 --> 1:24:36.305
-I think most of you know, Will
Vinton Studios was acquired by

1:24:36.372 --> 1:24:39.775
Phil Knight, and subsequently

1:24:39.808 --> 1:24:42.645
the name was
changed to Laika.

1:24:42.711 --> 1:24:46.149
There are those out there who
think that I should not be very

1:24:46.149 --> 1:24:47.750
comfortable with that.

1:24:47.783 --> 1:24:50.419
[laughing] So I'm gonna
set the record straight,

1:24:50.453 --> 1:24:51.754
um, right here.

1:24:51.787 --> 1:24:56.792
The truth is -- you know -- I
couldn't be more pleased that

1:24:56.925 --> 1:25:00.163
under such strong
financial leadership,

1:25:00.229 --> 1:25:03.332
that Laika has been able to
continue to grow and really

1:25:03.399 --> 1:25:06.202
expand on the
world of stop-motion.

1:25:06.235 --> 1:25:08.171
-Need a-- need the cigar.

1:25:08.171 --> 1:25:11.240
-[Will VO] For me, all of
this activity, I feel like a

1:25:11.307 --> 1:25:16.078
proud father, or bastard
father in this filmmaker scene.

1:25:16.679 --> 1:25:18.013
-Michele!

1:25:18.046 --> 1:25:19.682
-Oh Will, thank you.

1:25:19.715 --> 1:25:22.718
-[Will VO] And that's
been a continually gratifying

1:25:22.751 --> 1:25:26.021
aspect of this
company that we created.

1:25:26.054 --> 1:25:28.891
But what pushes me and gets
me excited are -- frankly -- my

1:25:28.924 --> 1:25:30.526
own projects.

1:25:30.559 --> 1:25:34.863
See something else come
to life in a new way.

1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:41.337
One that I'm extremely excited
about is this musical project

1:25:41.370 --> 1:25:43.206
called 'The Kiss.'

1:25:43.206 --> 1:25:46.275
I'm not a puppeteer but there's
a lot of time that a frog spends

1:25:46.342 --> 1:25:48.211
just sitting there.

1:25:48.244 --> 1:25:50.713
And that's one of their
charms is that they're just

1:25:50.746 --> 1:25:52.448
sitting there.

1:25:52.515 --> 1:25:54.783
And frogs are-- real
frogs, when they move,

1:25:54.850 --> 1:25:57.253
they're sudden a lot.

1:25:57.286 --> 1:25:59.755
You know, they hop or
they move or something,

1:25:59.788 --> 1:26:04.793
and then their backend
is completely still again.

1:26:05.794 --> 1:26:07.330
-[Melissa VO] It's an
idea that he was working on when

1:26:07.363 --> 1:26:09.832
he was at the studio -- 'The
Frog Prince' -- that he wanted

1:26:09.865 --> 1:26:12.268
to do as a feature film.

1:26:12.301 --> 1:26:17.306
Now he's metamorphosing that
to now he sees it as a musical.

1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:23.045
*"Sugar Lips" by David
Pomeranz and Will Vinton*

1:26:24.313 --> 1:26:26.482
-[Will VO] It's really
about all the things we've been

1:26:26.515 --> 1:26:27.716
talking about.

1:26:27.783 --> 1:26:31.554
It's about characters and
stories and entertainment,

1:26:31.620 --> 1:26:32.688
about music.

1:26:32.721 --> 1:26:33.956
It's about comedy.

1:26:33.989 --> 1:26:37.159
It's about great conflicts
that characters have to face.

1:26:37.260 --> 1:26:41.797
***

1:26:46.702 --> 1:26:50.339
As long as I'm alive, I'm
gonna keep making things.

1:26:50.373 --> 1:26:51.340
I just love it.

1:26:51.374 --> 1:26:53.842
I don't know what else to do.

1:26:53.876 --> 1:26:54.710
It's just great fun.

1:26:54.743 --> 1:26:57.713
It's just great, great fun.

1:26:57.746 --> 1:27:00.283
[drips]

1:27:00.316 --> 1:27:03.886
The condition I have -- it's
multiple myeloma -- is a blood

1:27:03.919 --> 1:27:08.090
cancer -- blood and bone.

1:27:08.724 --> 1:27:13.729
And I've sort of done in the
past is ignored and not talked

1:27:13.962 --> 1:27:17.766
about health issues.

1:27:17.800 --> 1:27:22.605
And if you don't talk about
it, people don't pick up on it,

1:27:22.638 --> 1:27:24.673
and so a lot of people -- even
good friends -- might not even

1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:29.077
know that I have this condition.

1:27:30.679 --> 1:27:32.781
If you did
mention it to somebody,

1:27:32.815 --> 1:27:35.651
suddenly that was everything.

1:27:35.918 --> 1:27:38.487
It's all anybody talked about,
and it's all anybody asked you

1:27:38.521 --> 1:27:40.188
about, and so forth.

1:27:40.323 --> 1:27:42.991
There are so many more things
I'd rather have them ask me

1:27:43.025 --> 1:27:46.595
about, like
how's-- like, you know...

1:27:46.629 --> 1:27:50.333
about the lead
character in 'The Kiss...'

1:27:50.333 --> 1:27:53.369
you know, how
does he really...[chuckles]

1:27:53.436 --> 1:27:56.004
is he really the captain of the
football team who's been

1:27:56.038 --> 1:27:59.174
handicapped by being a frog?

1:27:59.207 --> 1:28:02.210
I mean, that's fascinating,
that's good stuff to talk about

1:28:02.345 --> 1:28:06.114
to me, but...

1:28:06.181 --> 1:28:09.752
during a lot of that
time, I forget about it myself.

1:28:10.686 --> 1:28:14.022
Can't forget about it now
because I'm kind of into it

1:28:14.056 --> 1:28:16.859
intensely with
this new treatment,

1:28:16.892 --> 1:28:19.895
so we'll see how that goes.

1:28:20.696 --> 1:28:23.932
I've been a regular
for a long time, so...

1:28:27.102 --> 1:28:29.872
-2006

1:28:29.905 --> 1:28:33.942
-I think that Will becoming
very ill with this secret,

1:28:33.976 --> 1:28:38.981
internal disease and having a
company that is also sick at the

1:28:39.648 --> 1:28:44.119
same time with internal strife,
we don't know if those two

1:28:44.152 --> 1:28:46.154
things are related, but
it feels like they are,

1:28:46.221 --> 1:28:48.156
doesn't it?

1:28:48.223 --> 1:28:51.627
What would it have been like
if he had been able to say,

1:28:51.660 --> 1:28:55.498
"I'm scared to death"
or "I'm really angry?"

1:28:59.468 --> 1:29:02.838
If I could go back in
time, I'd shake him,

1:29:02.905 --> 1:29:07.175
and I'd say, "Tell me know you
really feel about all of this."

1:29:07.209 --> 1:29:08.411
-[woman] Bye, Will.
-Bye-bye!

1:29:08.477 --> 1:29:10.413
-[woman] Have a great week.
-See you, thanks.

1:29:10.413 --> 1:29:11.847
-[woman] You're welcome.

1:29:11.880 --> 1:29:14.082
-[Jesse VO] Dying
was very confusing for him.

1:29:14.149 --> 1:29:16.151
He would say, "If
only this was easier,

1:29:16.184 --> 1:29:21.189
if only I knew
kind of what to do."

1:29:23.191 --> 1:29:25.861
[breathes out]

1:29:25.894 --> 1:29:27.195
-I'm gonna cry.
I miss him.

1:29:27.229 --> 1:29:30.032
He's my friend.

1:29:30.065 --> 1:29:33.436
Thank you, Mr. Will...

1:29:33.436 --> 1:29:36.539
for everything.

1:29:36.572 --> 1:29:41.577
*slow synthesizer music

1:30:00.729 --> 1:30:02.465
-[Will VO] Everything
I've done is a build.

1:30:02.465 --> 1:30:03.466
There's
something that I've built,

1:30:03.532 --> 1:30:06.469
one thing on top of the other.

1:30:06.535 --> 1:30:10.739
I love being able to feel
like my life is a continuum.

1:30:10.773 --> 1:30:13.942
That things that maybe felt like
they might have been missteps

1:30:13.976 --> 1:30:15.911
was not at all a misstep.

1:30:15.944 --> 1:30:19.582

1:30:19.615 --> 1:30:22.050
-[Michele VO] Will
was an amalgam of all

1:30:22.084 --> 1:30:24.820
of his characters.

1:30:24.887 --> 1:30:28.824
It's almost as though you took
all that clay and you squished

1:30:28.891 --> 1:30:32.495
it back together in a
big multicolored ball,

1:30:32.828 --> 1:30:36.799
you'd have Will with his big
white mustache and his smile and

1:30:36.832 --> 1:30:39.735
his blue eyes.

1:30:39.768 --> 1:30:43.105
His work -- every time
someone discovers it --

1:30:43.138 --> 1:30:48.110
that pure childhood glee
and knowing that there's magic.

1:30:48.143 --> 1:30:51.614
There absolutely is magic.

1:30:51.647 --> 1:30:55.450

1:30:55.484 --> 1:30:56.985
-[Will VO] One of the
coolest things about being an

1:30:57.019 --> 1:30:59.354
artist is the thought that you
can create some of these things

1:30:59.421 --> 1:31:03.158
and it can go on and
live way beyond you.

1:31:04.426 --> 1:31:09.532
It's all such an intense web of
human life and human existence.

1:31:10.265 --> 1:31:12.901
