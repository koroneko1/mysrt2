Five, Ripley, and six...
Are you ready for this shit?

295
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:26,860
A Xenomorph egg.

296

- No way.
- Yeah.

297

Yes. Yes. Okay. 
Here's the plan.

298
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,702
Kirk and Picard team up to captain,
then when they get close,

299
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:37,121
they send Will and Goldblum
to get inside the lair.

- Fair.

Ripley's been bitching

'cause that's her move.

303

- It's the only way to save the world.
- The universe.

Right! Exactly!

306
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:52,594
So, Will and Goldblum 
get her inside the lair.

307

Ripley personally drops off the egg,
the facehugger attacks the big bad!

Ripley makes it back to Will and Goldblum,

they narrowly escape.

My name is Cole Johnson.
A guy was murdered in my living room.

uh... 2455 Bigby Drive.

- Are the attackers still in the house?

- Too many.

Can you please get my mom?
She's at the Hyatt in the city.

Of course, Cole. Now listen to me.
It's important that you stay hidden.
