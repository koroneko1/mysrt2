1
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:09,791
Happy New Year!

2
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:15,375
I'm Ryo Saeba, or City Hunter,
a private detective.

3
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,333
I like to work alone and stop crime.

4
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,291
I have a sidekick named Makimura.

5
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:25,041
But he's not as dashing
and as good a fighter as me.

6
00:01:25,458 --> 00:01:28,958
He's not as good-looking and short.

7
00:01:29,041 --> 00:01:30,041
Do you think it's right?

8
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,958
But we're close friends.
We've been through thick and thin.

9
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,166
We are invincible!

10
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:44,666
But he slipped up on one occasion
when he was alone.

11
00:01:55,666 --> 00:01:57,208
Makimura!

12
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,541
Makimura, are you okay?

13
00:02:01,875 --> 00:02:04,291
Do you think you'll be okay
after being shot 20 times?

14
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,125
Makimura, nothing will happen to you.

15
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:09,291
Ryo Saeba, I'll leave first.

16
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,916
Promise me you'll take care
of my sister, Kaori.

17
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:19,583
Okay, I swear I'll take care of her
till someone takes care of me.

18
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:22,541
One more thing. Keep your hands off her.

19
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,083
Okay, I swear I won't go after her.

20
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,416
All right. Now, I can rest in peace.

21
00:02:33,875 --> 00:02:35,041
Makimura!

22
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,083
Since then, Kaori became my only family.

23
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,291
What I didn't realize was that

24
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,416
little girls grow up very quickly.

25
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,291
Faster than you can ever imagine.

26
00:02:57,625 --> 00:02:58,666
Don't you agree?

27
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,333
Why did I ever promise Makimura
I won't go after her?

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,166
Makimura, I know I made a promise.

29
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:11,708
Can I change my mind now?

30
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:13,333
No!

31
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:20,333
Since then, Kaori has become my assistant.

32
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,291
I never knew what she felt about me.

33
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:24,916
Until one day...

34
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,833
Damn Ryo Saeba, sleeping again!

35
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,041
Hey, Ryo Saeba.

36
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:35,625
Hey, wake up.

37
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,333
Hey, get up. Stop sleeping.

38
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:42,958
It's time. Wake up!

39
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,541
Hey.

40
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,166
Ryo Saeba, you're with us all the time.

41
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:50,875
Won't Kaori be jealous?

42
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:52,708
What? Kaori?

43
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,875
She's like a sister to me.

44
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,166
She's at home cleaning the toilet.

45
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,291
What? Cleaning the toilet?

46
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:02,958
Ryo Saeba, she's like a cute puppy dog.

47
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,500
Her? She's big and fat.

48
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:11,166
She plods along like an elephant.
She eats seven meals a day.

49
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,916
She likes going out and fooling around.
She's fine with any guys.

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,333
Whenever you ask her something,
she just sticks out her tongue,

51
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:23,208
holds up her hands,
and sways her hips from side to side.

52
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:28,791
I want to give her away.

53
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,666
But there are no takers.

54
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:31,958
Damn you, Ryo Saeba!

55
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,333
That feels good!

56
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:43,666
Hey!

57
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,916
Wake up!

58
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,541
Stop sleeping! Hey!

59
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,125
He's Ryo Saeba. I'm his assistant, Kaori.

60
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,083
We're here to see Mr. Imamura.

61
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,041
Hey, wake up, Ryo!

62
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,041
You're at the client's office!

63
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:13,416
Hey, wake up!

64
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:21,208
What kind of perfume
and foundation do you use?

65
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:22,833
What skin care products do you use?

66
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:24,250
What do you do?

67
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,833
-I'm a secretary.
-I see.

68
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:26,916
What's your name?

69
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,416
I became a midget!

70
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:38,791
Hey, what are you thinking?

71
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:40,333
None of your business!

72
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:45,750
Mr. Ryo Saeba, I'm Koji Imamura,
head of Imamura Publishing.

73
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,666
She's my only daughter, Shizuko.

74
00:06:50,708 --> 00:06:52,291
Her mother died when she was young.

75
00:06:52,375 --> 00:06:54,875
So, she's very rebellious.

76
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,291
Last year, I met a lady.

77
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,541
Our relationship developed fast and
intend to get married this year.

78
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,833
But Shizuko objected and left home.

79
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:10,875
After many inquiries, I've discovered
she went to Hong Kong alone.

80
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:13,666
So you want me to find her for you?

81
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,666
Yes, but not by force.

82
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:20,791
Don't worry.
He won't be violent to the ladies.

83
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,083
Great! Any news of Shizuko?

84
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,625
I have to talk to you.

85
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,166
-Talk!
-I prepared a birthday present for you.

86
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,916
What? A skateboard gang?

87
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:59,166
Where? Victoria Park?

88
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,583
Ocean Park?

89
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,083
Do you like cruises?

90
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:05,000
Yes, I do.

91
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,750
-Let's take a cruise on a luxury liner.
-What? I see.

92
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:11,291
You just have a way
of getting information.

93
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,250
What did you say?

94
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,833
-Would you like to go on a cruise?
-I see.

95
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,125
Idiot! Don't you know how to drive?

96
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:24,375
Kaori, get off now and go over
to Victoria Park at once.

97
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,583
See if Shizuko is there. Go.

98
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,125
I'll check Ocean Park.

99
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,750
We'll talk later.

100
00:08:31,666 --> 00:08:33,958
Damn you, Ryo Saeba!

101
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,166
Run me down!

102
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,208
Come on!

103
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,583
What's the big deal of having a car?

104
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,166
Come on, run me down!

105
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,583
Next time, I'll smash it with a hammer!

106
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,041
Shizuko, are you Japanese?

107
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,416
Do I sound Japanese?

108
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,791
How about going to a disco tonight?

109
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,291
Not having enough fun now? Let's go then.

110
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,208
Hey!

111
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:25,875
Sorry!

112
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,833
Hey, you're Shizuko Imamura?

113
00:09:38,125 --> 00:09:39,166
This is too easy.

114
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,416
Who are you?

115
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,625
I'm Ryo Saeba.
Your dad hired me to bring you home.

116
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:53,000
Hey, don't run!

117
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,750
-What's the matter?
-He tried to molest me! Stop him!

118
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:58,958
What?

119
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,375
Hey, why did you bully my girlfriend?

120
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,083
You bad guy! You beat me!

121
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,000
After him!

122
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,916
Don't go!

123
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:27,666
Don't go!

124
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,500
Damn! He got away!

125
00:11:45,166 --> 00:11:46,000
Sorry!

126
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,875
Shopping for something, Miss?

127
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,708
Can you help me, Mister?

128
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:17,375
Me?

129
00:12:17,458 --> 00:12:18,833
Yes, you.

130
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:20,541
Sure!

131
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:43,958
What?

132
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,166
Kaori, where are you? I'm starving.

133
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:17,291
I haven't eaten all day.

134
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:19,166
Where did you go?

135
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:20,541
"Ryo Saeba's birthday..."

136
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,458
RYO SAEBA'S BIRTHDAY

137
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,625
My birthday?

138
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,625
How miserable.
There's nothing to eat on my birthday.

139
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,916
Half a cracker?

140
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:36,541
Kaori, where are you?

141
00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:41,958
Happy birthday!

142
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,250
I'll be damned...

143
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,500
So many ladies remember my birthday.

144
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:54,875
Surprise!

145
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,125
Do I know you?

146
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,958
You think about it.

147
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,375
Forget it. Let's not think about it.

148
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,833
I'm starving. Let's have some cake.

149
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:04,125
-We'll feed you after we tie you up.
-Yes.

150
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:07,666
Sure, let's do it.

151
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
I'm starving.

152
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,458
Are you short-sighted? Over here.

153
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,541
No, but you are! We have never met.

154
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:19,458
Why are you celebrating my birthday?

155
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,458
You've arrested our men.

156
00:14:21,541 --> 00:14:23,000
-We're making you pay!
-Right!

157
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,625
-Hit him!
-No!

158
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,541
Don't go!

159
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,625
After him!

160
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:29,208
Don't go!

161
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:32,958
-Listen to me!
-I don't want!

162
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:34,083
No!

163
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,875
You have nowhere to go. Stop running!

164
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,750
Hit him! Over there!

165
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:41,416
Grab him.

166
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,375
Freeze!

167
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,125
Put down your weapons!

168
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,416
Happy birthday...

169
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:56,541
Kaori.

170
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,625
What are they doing here?

171
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,083
They're trying to kill me.

172
00:15:01,166 --> 00:15:03,416
But you're holding a gun.

173
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,708
What game are you playing?

174
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,333
-Ryo!
-What?

175
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:12,958
Who's she? She's so ugly!

176
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,125
She's my...

177
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:16,750
Damn you, Ryo Saeba!

178
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,125
I hate you!

179
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,125
I'm going on a cruise with my cousin!

180
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,333
Kaori.

181
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,416
Jeez.

182
00:15:32,583 --> 00:15:34,083
It's all your fault, you bitches!

183
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,458
Don't use your gun if you're man enough!

184
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,833
Fine!

185
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,750
Let me show you my skills.

186
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,416
Don't come any closer!

187
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:14,083
You should've dumped that asshole
Ryo Saeba a long time ago, Kaori.

188
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:19,250
He's got such a big nose and tiny eyes.

189
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:24,458
He's just a muscle man.
What's so good about him?

190
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,625
-You dropped your pants.
-What?

191
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,000
Who the hell are you?

192
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,250
An apology is not enough!

193
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,958
You'll never know what I'm saying.

194
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:50,708
You foreigners are disgusting.

195
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,000
You queers!

196
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,416
I hope you all get AIDS.

197
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,166
How can you say that?

198
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:59,166
Didn't your father teach you any manners?

199
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,250
You dropped your pants again.

200
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,666
Kaori!

201
00:17:15,583 --> 00:17:16,750
Wait for me!

202
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,000
Wait up!

203
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,875
Of course!

204
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:38,958
Hey!

205
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,375
Where have you been?

206
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,708
Why do you walk so slow?

207
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,333
It's time, let's go!

208
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,500
That's so humiliating!

209
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:58,541
You know him?

210
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,291
Ryo Saeba. He's a private eye.

211
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,333
He's Ryo Saeba?

212
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,166
He's a real pain.

213
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:19,625
Kaori!

214
00:18:20,875 --> 00:18:21,875
Welcome.

215
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:24,333
Sir, please show us your invitation card.

216
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:26,083
Have a gum.

217
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,375
Sir, I need to see your invitation card.

218
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:30,833
-The card, right?
-Yes.

219
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:33,500
You have a great sense of humor!

220
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:39,000
Hey, hold on.

221
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:40,541
MAHJONG CLUB

222
00:18:41,041 --> 00:18:43,208
Mahjong club membership card?

223
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,875
I'll find a way to get in there.

224
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,875
-Please. You may board the ship.
-Thank you.

225
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,083
All guests, please take note.

226
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,000
Fuji Maru is about to sail.

227
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:38,333
I'm starving!

228
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:44,375
I got on the ship so easily.

229
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,041
Let's get something to eat.

230
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,541
Be extra careful when working on deck.

231
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:14,541
Where's the restaurant?

232
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:15,833
It's...

233
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,041
-I know.
-You...

234
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:20,333
Grab him, but don't alert
the other passengers.

235
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:56,041
Have a drink, sir.

236
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:00,708
Come on, sir, have a drink.

237
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:02,708
Thank you!

238
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,291
What are you doing?

239
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:28,250
-I didn't see anything.
-You looked up her skirt!

240
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,541
Hey, don't step on the bread!

241
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,166
Hey!

242
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:37,916
You stepped on my bread!

243
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:48,291
Why did you do that? Give it back to me.

244
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:50,833
Over there. Get him!

245
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,041
Catch!

246
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,875
DANGEROUS, KEEP AWAY

247
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,541
-Did you see him?
-No!

248
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:58,541
No?

249
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,625
Where did he go?

250
00:22:00,916 --> 00:22:02,166
Look around!

251
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,875
There's a ship in front!
Sound the foghorn.

252
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:08,875
Yes, sir.

253
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:35,791
Please.

254
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:42,333
What a beautiful room!

255
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:44,916
-Put the luggage away.
-Okay.

256
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:54,208
Hold me.

257
00:22:56,916 --> 00:22:57,833
You fell again?

258
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:59,750
I lost my balance again.

259
00:23:00,625 --> 00:23:02,708
That's because you carry too much weight.

260
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,708
This is the Fuji Maru liner.

261
00:23:11,291 --> 00:23:15,041
They say that all the passengers
onboard are filthy rich.

262
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,208
Do you think I'll find

263
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:20,250
a rich and handsome boyfriend?

264
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:21,750
Don't forget your mission.

265
00:23:23,625 --> 00:23:25,666
My job is to act as your cover.

266
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:29,250
Do I get a reward if you crack the case?

267
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,833
Of course. If the tip is correct,

268
00:23:31,916 --> 00:23:33,875
the terrorists are planning
a robbery on the ship.

269
00:23:34,958 --> 00:23:36,708
Why don't they cancel the cruise?

270
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,541
Because we have no proof.

271
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,833
Even my superior wouldn't commit himself.
I have to come onboard and investigate it.

272
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,416
Are you armed?

273
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,250
I brought a few things.

274
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,166
You almost kicked me.

275
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,583
You're very late.

276
00:24:56,875 --> 00:24:58,041
We got stuck in traffic.

277
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,625
This is a nice room.

278
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,708
Let's enjoy ourselves here.

279
00:25:07,416 --> 00:25:11,041
You shouldn't be late.
We can't afford to slip up.

280
00:25:11,916 --> 00:25:14,333
Take it easy. Relax.

281
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:15,916
Let's enjoy our time for now.

282
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:18,916
Until midnight.

283
00:25:21,875 --> 00:25:23,916
Come on.

284
00:25:31,166 --> 00:25:34,333
You won't get to know any rich men
with the way you're eating.

285
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,458
I can't help myself.

286
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:52,541
Are they all chewing gum,
or have I gone deaf?

287
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Saeko, look, it's that fool
from this morning.

288
00:26:02,375 --> 00:26:05,916
There's always trouble
wherever Ryo Saeba goes.

289
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,750
-Hi.
-Hey!

290
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,458
Don't get bitchy.

291
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,291
I want to.

292
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:50,041
He's so horny. Aren't you scared?

293
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:52,250
All men are like that.

294
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:54,250
He'll go for any woman.

295
00:26:54,708 --> 00:26:56,458
Who's better than me?

296
00:26:56,625 --> 00:26:58,458
-He's poor.
-What?

297
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,750
What a waste of time!

298
00:27:01,708 --> 00:27:02,958
Hamburger.

299
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,375
Don't go, hamburger.

300
00:27:08,625 --> 00:27:10,625
-You like them?
-Very much!

301
00:27:11,583 --> 00:27:14,416
Just wait, they'll be ours tonight.

302
00:27:16,083 --> 00:27:17,750
-You go that way, I'll go this way.
-Follow me.

303
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:19,541
Sorry!

304
00:27:19,625 --> 00:27:20,791
Hurry!

305
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,416
Here we come!

306
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:25,458
Wait!

307
00:27:36,708 --> 00:27:40,250
Kaori, we'll get married
when we reach Japan,

308
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,666
have a few kids,

309
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
and say goodbye to Ryo Saeba for good.

310
00:27:47,875 --> 00:27:49,625
He'll come looking for me.

311
00:27:50,083 --> 00:27:52,291
Not when we're at sea.

312
00:27:52,541 --> 00:27:54,791
Unless he can fly.

313
00:27:54,875 --> 00:27:56,125
Kaori!

314
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:01,875
Protect me!

315
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:03,666
No problem!

316
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,583
What are you doing?

317
00:28:18,416 --> 00:28:20,833
Why are you here? Why don't you go
with your six girlfriends?

318
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:23,041
I can't hear you.

319
00:28:23,125 --> 00:28:25,416
Get lost! Leave us alone!

320
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,583
I've turned deaf, Kaori.

321
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,500
You always turn a deaf ear on me.

322
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:34,541
I'll come back on three conditions.

323
00:28:34,625 --> 00:28:36,416
One, never meet another woman.

324
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,333
Two, never date another woman.

325
00:28:38,416 --> 00:28:40,458
Three, never look at another woman.

326
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,291
Damn! I'm deaf!

327
00:28:43,375 --> 00:28:44,500
I really can't hear you.

328
00:28:44,583 --> 00:28:45,791
Forget it!

329
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,708
What?

330
00:28:57,208 --> 00:28:59,833
If my cousin weren't here,

331
00:28:59,916 --> 00:29:03,208
I would use my Lethal Dragon Claw
to kill you!

332
00:29:03,625 --> 00:29:04,458
What?

333
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,083
Let's go!

334
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,750
It's your lucky day!

335
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,666
-Let me tell you a secret.
-What is it?

336
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,375
The doctor says I have hemorrhoids.

337
00:29:13,458 --> 00:29:16,166
-Really? Why are you swimming, then?
-Don't tell anyone.

338
00:29:16,583 --> 00:29:18,125
I can hear everything!

339
00:29:33,958 --> 00:29:35,041
Mine's eight.

340
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,875
Banker has nine. Banker wins.

341
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:42,666
Good!

342
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:45,791
I lost with an eight, that's outrageous!

343
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:52,166
I told you the banker would win.
You wouldn't listen to me.

344
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:53,458
I'm betting on the banker!

345
00:29:59,375 --> 00:30:03,291
-Welcome!
-Why do we need two rooms?

346
00:30:03,625 --> 00:30:06,125
This is a romantic cruise.

347
00:30:06,541 --> 00:30:10,166
Don't you think a great love story
will take place here?

348
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:13,541
Tonight, why don't I...

349
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,166
Fine! You can sleep in my room tonight.

350
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:18,791
All right.

351
00:30:18,958 --> 00:30:20,250
But, I'll go and sleep in your room.

352
00:30:24,666 --> 00:30:29,416
I've been badly bruised.
But, I'll get rid of it.

353
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:31,208
Hey!

354
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,125
Rocky, don't ever feel
ashamed or inferior.

355
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:37,750
You must have no shame,

356
00:30:37,833 --> 00:30:39,000
set aside your pride

357
00:30:39,083 --> 00:30:42,333
until you win her heart.

358
00:30:42,708 --> 00:30:45,416
You will surely succeed!

359
00:30:47,958 --> 00:30:52,125
She'll belong to me!

360
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,125
That's lecherous enough!

361
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:03,750
Let's go and have a few games.

362
00:34:04,166 --> 00:34:05,541
Don't forget we're on a mission.

363
00:34:06,458 --> 00:34:10,083
Jeez, we might pick up some clues
at the gambling table.

364
00:34:12,791 --> 00:34:13,625
Hey.

365
00:34:13,916 --> 00:34:15,625
That man is good-looking.

366
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:17,583
He must be rich.

367
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,250
Stop dreaming. That's Gundam.

368
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:21,875
He's the gambling king of Asia.

369
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:25,500
He'll take your money
as well as break your heart.

370
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:29,000
Wherever he goes, trouble follows.

371
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,250
Seven.

372
00:34:35,333 --> 00:34:36,166
Mine's seven.

373
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,375
Four.

374
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,333
Eight, I've won again.

375
00:34:42,666 --> 00:34:44,875
You always get either an eight or a nine.
You must be cheating!

376
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,166
Come on, take your losses like a man.

377
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,041
-Search him!
-Yes, sir!

378
00:34:55,041 --> 00:34:55,875
Sorry, sir.

379
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:25,458
Don't make trouble here, sir.

380
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:28,291
I was only defending myself.
Here, take this tip.

381
00:35:29,041 --> 00:35:30,166
Get rid of this for me.

382
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,666
Cash me out, please!

383
00:35:32,416 --> 00:35:33,750
-Please continue!
-It's all right.

384
00:35:33,916 --> 00:35:34,875
Thanks!

385
00:35:35,375 --> 00:35:36,375
Your ace of hearts.

386
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,000
Keep it as a souvenir.

387
00:35:45,791 --> 00:35:48,291
Hey, let me have him
if you don't want him. What a waste!

388
00:35:48,375 --> 00:35:49,541
He has good taste.

389
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:11,041
Okay, Let's synchronize our watches.
It's exactly 23:31 p.m. now.

390
00:36:11,291 --> 00:36:13,125
Another 29 minutes till midnight.

391
00:36:29,041 --> 00:36:31,041
Vincent, you and Team A
move in four minutes.

392
00:36:31,208 --> 00:36:32,166
Yes, Boss.

393
00:36:33,166 --> 00:36:35,875
Mike, you and Team B
start in nine minutes.

394
00:36:35,958 --> 00:36:36,791
Sure!

395
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:42,416
Kim and I will be in the casino
enjoying the view.

396
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:49,208
Relax!

397
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:52,125
We'll succeed for sure.

398
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,750
You heard the boss.

399
00:36:53,958 --> 00:36:55,208
Don't cause any trouble!

400
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:05,375
Okay, I have here a list of 30 names.

401
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:08,291
They're all millionaires.

402
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:11,125
We take over the ship
and take them hostage.

403
00:37:11,375 --> 00:37:12,458
What about the others?

404
00:37:16,083 --> 00:37:17,958
The sharks should be hungry by now.

405
00:37:18,458 --> 00:37:19,708
Throw them into the ocean.

406
00:37:33,666 --> 00:37:35,125
Go to the next room and take a look.

407
00:37:35,416 --> 00:37:36,416
Yes, Boss.

408
00:37:37,125 --> 00:37:38,000
Let's go!

409
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:48,708
Who is it?

410
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:49,666
Room service, miss.

411
00:37:49,916 --> 00:37:50,750
Hold on!

412
00:37:57,791 --> 00:37:58,666
Come in!

413
00:38:22,583 --> 00:38:24,125
What's the matter? Can I help you, miss?

414
00:38:24,208 --> 00:38:27,208
Something happened.

415
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:29,625
I need to see the captain. Where is he?

416
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:32,166
Relax! He's resting now.

417
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,416
Tell me what the matter is.

418
00:38:33,666 --> 00:38:35,500
No, it's very serious.

419
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:38,750
Sorry, captain's orders. I can't help you.

420
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:44,250
A group of terrorists is planning
to take the passengers hostage.

421
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,083
Where did you hear this?

422
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:47,416
I overheard them.

423
00:38:47,875 --> 00:38:49,625
They're planning to hijack the ship.

424
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:52,458
I'll take you to the Captain. Follow me.

425
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:55,041
Careful.

426
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,125
I'll starve to death
if I still don't get something to eat.

427
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:09,458
A rat!

428
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:13,291
I can have a snack after all!

429
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:25,041
Where's the captain?

430
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:26,250
He's in the nightclub.

431
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:28,500
Why did you bring me here?

432
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:31,041
You said there are terrorists.

433
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,875
Yes!

434
00:39:34,333 --> 00:39:35,500
I'm one of them.

435
00:39:39,625 --> 00:39:40,500
You...

436
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:42,375
We're taking over the ship

437
00:39:42,458 --> 00:39:44,208
and ship the rich men to Thailand.

438
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:45,583
You scum!

439
00:39:46,208 --> 00:39:47,875
Sorry, little lady!

440
00:39:52,666 --> 00:39:53,500
Sorry!

441
00:39:55,875 --> 00:39:58,208
Ryo Saeba, what are you doing here?

442
00:39:58,541 --> 00:39:59,583
I came to see you.

443
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:01,833
Here, hold this for me.

444
00:40:05,375 --> 00:40:06,500
That was my snack!

445
00:40:06,666 --> 00:40:07,500
Don't move!

446
00:40:13,833 --> 00:40:14,666
Don't move!

447
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,250
If anyone moves, he gets it.
Shizuko, go now!

448
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,458
Got it.

449
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,791
-Shoot!
-Don't!

450
00:40:27,333 --> 00:40:28,833
No bullets? What a pain.

451
00:40:32,875 --> 00:40:35,666
Attention, Squad 3,
kill the couple in white.

452
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,666
Wait for me!

453
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:07,541
Search around!

454
00:41:24,375 --> 00:41:25,458
Over here!

455
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,000
Hey.

456
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:46,500
Move and I'll shoot.

457
00:42:01,458 --> 00:42:02,708
You...

458
00:42:04,958 --> 00:42:07,208
-Are you all right, Shizuko?
-I'm fine.

459
00:42:10,041 --> 00:42:11,250
How handsome!

460
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,125
I meant him.

461
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:18,750
He's not bad.

462
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:21,625
He's a good fighter. He's not even afraid
of that tall, black guy.

463
00:42:21,708 --> 00:42:23,666
I can handle two or three
at a time in real life.

464
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,916
Get up and attract their attention.

465
00:42:31,208 --> 00:42:32,416
What? I don't understand.

466
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,958
You're the bait.

467
00:42:34,041 --> 00:42:35,250
No way!

468
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,083
You've wasted all the bullets, stupid!

469
00:42:53,583 --> 00:42:55,166
Don't worry, I still have my fists.

470
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:02,708
Two or three is nothing for you, right?

471
00:43:02,958 --> 00:43:03,875
Grab them!

472
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:05,958
Let's go!

473
00:43:09,666 --> 00:43:11,958
Shit! What now?

474
00:43:12,375 --> 00:43:13,250
That's your line.

475
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,541
What now?

476
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,416
Don't worry, I'll take care of them.

477
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:22,750
Are you all right?

478
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:25,291
Not a scratch!

479
00:43:27,666 --> 00:43:28,750
That hurts.

480
00:43:46,208 --> 00:43:50,250
Come on, go ahead and kill me.

481
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:56,666
Your shoes are so large!

482
00:44:13,291 --> 00:44:14,125
Don't come near!

483
00:44:55,125 --> 00:44:56,791
Put me down!

484
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:58,541
Ryo Saeba!

485
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:02,666
Help me! Ryo Saeba!

486
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,458
I dare you to put her down!

487
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:11,208
Don't come near.

488
00:46:09,708 --> 00:46:10,833
You're incredible!

489
00:46:15,041 --> 00:46:15,958
Ryo Saeba!

490
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,250
How many terrorists are there?

491
00:46:24,791 --> 00:46:25,833
I don't know.

492
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,708
-How many guns?
-I don't know.

493
00:46:28,666 --> 00:46:29,750
Find a place to hide.

494
00:46:29,833 --> 00:46:30,833
Where's safe?

495
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:31,875
Your room.

496
00:46:32,166 --> 00:46:33,333
I just came from there.

497
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,958
They won't look for you there.

498
00:46:36,375 --> 00:46:37,583
Thanks, Brother Siu Lung.

499
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:39,833
Don't mention it!

500
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,083
Don't move!

501
00:46:55,750 --> 00:46:58,041
Don't move. Hands on your heads!

502
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:00,958
We're taking over the ship.

503
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:03,916
In your dreams!

504
00:47:10,791 --> 00:47:11,791
Ladies and gentlemen.

505
00:47:12,125 --> 00:47:14,791
Captain Williams will now
uncork the champagne

506
00:47:15,250 --> 00:47:17,291
to wish everyone a pleasant voyage.

507
00:47:17,958 --> 00:47:19,041
Please welcome him!

508
00:47:24,583 --> 00:47:26,291
How great would it be
if Ryo Saeba was here?

509
00:47:26,666 --> 00:47:27,750
What's so great about that?

510
00:47:32,041 --> 00:47:33,125
How's my bow tie?

511
00:47:34,166 --> 00:47:35,000
Fine.

512
00:48:09,208 --> 00:48:12,041
-There really are terrorists!
-Don't be afraid.

513
00:48:34,791 --> 00:48:36,208
Why did you drop the gun?

514
00:48:49,125 --> 00:48:51,333
We meet again, gorgeous!

515
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:55,708
You finished one off?

516
00:49:01,791 --> 00:49:03,708
-What are you doing?
-Looking for something to eat.

517
00:49:04,583 --> 00:49:06,375
Tobacco? Damn!

518
00:49:06,583 --> 00:49:08,125
That's hazardous to your health.

519
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,625
Hey, do you have anything to eat?

520
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:11,250
Want some gum?

521
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:12,916
That will do, too.

522
00:49:17,583 --> 00:49:18,583
What's that?

523
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:21,166
A microcomputer.

524
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,500
It contains the identities
of every criminal.

525
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,750
Just scan their prints

526
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:29,291
and it will call up their rap sheets.

527
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:31,291
Understand? Bend over.

528
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:33,791
We'll scan your butt

529
00:49:34,208 --> 00:49:36,333
and find out who those men are.

530
00:49:40,083 --> 00:49:43,041
Ryo Saeba, also known as City Hunter.
A private detective.

531
00:49:43,125 --> 00:49:46,250
Distinguishing features are
handsome, a womanizer,

532
00:49:46,458 --> 00:49:49,833
a good fighter, honest, intelligent,
reliable, and nice to his parents.

533
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:51,333
It was you!

534
00:49:52,375 --> 00:49:53,208
Just kidding!

535
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:02,166
They stayed next door.
Their prints will surely be there.

536
00:50:10,416 --> 00:50:12,250
John Chan, international terrorist,

537
00:50:12,375 --> 00:50:14,500
wanted by 17 countries,

538
00:50:14,708 --> 00:50:17,833
ex-member of at least
two terrorist groups...

539
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:20,416
See? Let's see who else is there.

540
00:50:30,625 --> 00:50:31,750
How do you do, Mr. Chan?

541
00:50:35,625 --> 00:50:36,541
Time to go!

542
00:50:51,541 --> 00:50:55,083
Allow me to introduce myself.

543
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:57,208
You may call me MacDonald.

544
00:50:57,916 --> 00:50:59,125
I only want money.

545
00:50:59,708 --> 00:51:02,875
Please don't do anything stupid.

546
00:51:03,208 --> 00:51:05,750
If you cooperate, we won't kill you.

547
00:51:06,041 --> 00:51:08,916
Otherwise, you'll be executed.

548
00:51:10,625 --> 00:51:11,458
Here.

549
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:13,666
I have a list of names.

550
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:15,208
I will read them off one by one.

551
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:18,125
When you hear your name, come forward.

552
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:21,000
I'll shoot and kill anyone
who doesn't comply.

553
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:24,916
Okay, I'll start now.

554
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,291
Mr. Robinson.

555
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:29,625
-That's me!
-Don't go.

556
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:32,333
-Don't go.
-I'll be dead if I don't.

557
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:39,208
Wait here.

558
00:51:41,708 --> 00:51:45,708
Give it to me.

559
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,666
-What?
-Hey!

560
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,041
-He is hitting us!
-Play the game, not us.

561
00:51:52,125 --> 00:51:53,000
What are you doing here?

562
00:51:53,083 --> 00:51:54,333
Playing Street Fighter.

563
00:51:54,416 --> 00:51:56,166
There are terrorists on the ship.
Do you know that?

564
00:51:56,250 --> 00:51:57,333
You're terrifying enough!

565
00:51:57,583 --> 00:51:59,500
They're holding hostages, understand?

566
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:00,666
What a bummer!

567
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:02,708
What's the best way to the casino?

568
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:04,375
Take the elevator.

569
00:52:04,625 --> 00:52:05,458
Jeez.

570
00:52:06,125 --> 00:52:07,708
I mean secretly.

571
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:10,541
Just don't tell anyone.

572
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:13,666
Never mind! Call the police!
Don't go running around!

573
00:52:13,750 --> 00:52:14,833
Understand?

574
00:52:18,958 --> 00:52:19,791
Now what?

575
00:52:19,875 --> 00:52:20,791
Let's go and cool down.

576
00:52:21,416 --> 00:52:22,333
Cool down?

577
00:52:23,083 --> 00:52:27,208
Let's play a little game.

578
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:30,666
I want you all to empty your pockets.

579
00:52:30,750 --> 00:52:32,625
Give us your cash and jewelry.

580
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:35,500
Give them to the men in red.

581
00:52:36,500 --> 00:52:39,666
Hurry.

582
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:43,500
Hurry up!

583
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:47,125
After that, form a line.

584
00:52:47,333 --> 00:52:49,083
Since you like to gamble,

585
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:51,583
I'll be the banker

586
00:52:51,666 --> 00:52:53,500
and let's see who the winner is.

587
00:52:54,208 --> 00:52:55,041
Good. Excellent.

588
00:52:55,333 --> 00:52:58,500
Ryo Saeba is on the boat and on the loose.

589
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:02,583
Go get him! I want him alive!

590
00:53:02,791 --> 00:53:03,666
Yes, sir.

591
00:53:07,833 --> 00:53:09,250
Let's send a distress call!

592
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:10,875
Look what this is!

593
00:53:11,833 --> 00:53:12,666
That's amazing!

594
00:53:12,750 --> 00:53:15,666
The newly-invented transmitter.

595
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,708
Watch this, pal.

596
00:53:16,791 --> 00:53:18,416
This is a transmitter?

597
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:22,958
I got this from
the Shopping Channel for 500.

598
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:24,541
Really?

599
00:53:24,625 --> 00:53:27,458
What's that? Don't you know?

600
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:29,041
-You pressed one, two, three, four.
-Yes!

601
00:53:29,125 --> 00:53:31,541
-What is that?
-It's a cipher.

602
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,708
What does it mean? Look up!

603
00:53:32,791 --> 00:53:34,500
-There's a word. Let's read it.
-All right.

604
00:53:38,583 --> 00:53:39,750
Stay in line!

605
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:50,500
You're the first. Please sit down.

606
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,958
You like baccarat?

607
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,208
Sure!

608
00:53:58,291 --> 00:54:00,458
Good! Let's begin.

609
00:54:09,041 --> 00:54:09,875
Mine's seven.

610
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:12,500
Good, seven.

611
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,333
Mine's nine.

612
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:27,583
Six.

613
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:29,541
I've got six too.

614
00:54:30,208 --> 00:54:33,375
-It's a tie.
-Sorry, the banker has the advantage.

615
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:37,166
Next!

616
00:54:37,625 --> 00:54:40,041
I won't bet. I'll die if I lose!

617
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,375
Be a gentleman. Take her to your room.

618
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,416
Get up!

619
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,666
No!

620
00:55:02,750 --> 00:55:03,875
-Wait!
-What is it?

621
00:55:05,208 --> 00:55:08,958
I wanted to ask you
if you would like some of this tonic...

622
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,958
Let me play first. Trust me.

623
00:55:41,375 --> 00:55:42,208
Seven.

624
00:56:05,916 --> 00:56:07,125
Let's play another round.

625
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,666
-Over there!
-Okay.

626
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:28,166
Incredible! 12 wins in a row.

627
00:57:06,875 --> 00:57:09,916
Mr. MacDonald, do you want to know
where Ryo Saeba is?

628
00:57:10,041 --> 00:57:11,708
You know where Ryo Saeba is?

629
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:13,291
Of course!

630
00:57:13,750 --> 00:57:15,416
Tell me and I'll spare you.

631
00:57:35,291 --> 00:57:36,291
I don't know.

632
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:13,625
Go over there and distract him.

633
00:58:33,833 --> 00:58:34,666
You...

634
00:58:35,041 --> 00:58:36,666
Hey, that has nothing to do with me.

635
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:39,791
Ryo, what about me?

636
00:58:39,875 --> 00:58:40,833
Stay there and don't leave.

637
00:58:40,916 --> 00:58:41,750
Okay.

638
00:58:54,958 --> 00:58:55,791
Ryo Saeba!

639
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:56,958
You're a good fighter.

640
00:58:57,041 --> 00:58:58,833
The blonde guy took Kaori. Go rescue her.

641
00:58:58,916 --> 00:59:01,208
-There's still one up there.
-I'll go after him.

642
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:18,625
What's your hurry?

643
00:59:21,833 --> 00:59:25,166
Let's get the mood right first.

644
01:00:04,416 --> 01:00:06,291
You're great! I really like you.

645
01:00:08,708 --> 01:00:10,875
So you enjoy a little rough stuff?

646
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:19,833
It's my turn!

647
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:24,333
Okay, go ahead. Not there, here.

648
01:00:32,125 --> 01:00:34,125
Fantastic.

649
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:36,041
It's my turn again!

650
01:00:43,041 --> 01:00:46,291
-Feeling good?
-I'm feeling so good.

651
01:00:47,208 --> 01:00:48,708
Here I come.

652
01:00:56,875 --> 01:00:57,791
Kaori!

653
01:01:00,375 --> 01:01:02,291
-Why are you here?
-To save you.

654
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:05,583
I don't need your help.
We're having a good time here.

655
01:01:08,708 --> 01:01:09,791
Who is he?

656
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:10,916
I'm Ryo Saeba.

657
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:12,958
Ryo Saeba?

658
01:01:16,125 --> 01:01:18,250
I heard you can fight, City Hunter.

659
01:01:18,541 --> 01:01:22,708
He's pretty good, too.

660
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,125
Hit him now!

661
01:01:34,083 --> 01:01:35,208
You laid a finger on my girl?

662
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:39,625
He said I'm his girl?

663
01:01:45,666 --> 01:01:48,250
Ryo Saeba, what did you say just now?

664
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:49,416
What?

665
01:01:51,916 --> 01:01:53,166
Say that again.

666
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:54,125
What?

667
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:57,500
Damn!

668
01:01:58,791 --> 01:01:59,958
Not that!

669
01:02:52,250 --> 01:02:53,250
Damn!

670
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:56,583
You're right, I can fight!

671
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:00,583
Don't move!

672
01:03:07,333 --> 01:03:08,166
Freeze!

673
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:09,083
I'm not moving.

674
01:03:13,541 --> 01:03:14,375
Give me a gun!

675
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:15,875
-Don't give it to him.
-What?

676
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,708
Fight me if you can.

677
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,583
-Get her!
-Yes, sir.

678
01:03:25,333 --> 01:03:28,375
Hello, nice to meet you, Mr. Ryo Saeba.

679
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:29,750
Damn!

680
01:03:29,833 --> 01:03:32,500
Drop your gun and let's fight,
Colonel MacDonald.

681
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:34,083
You know me?

682
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:37,333
Colonel MacDonald of the US Commandos.

683
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:40,208
You're nothing but a bandit.

684
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,916
Yes, you're right.
And now, I'm sentencing you to death.

685
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:44,958
I want to appeal.

686
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:49,166
Appeal denied. You're to be executed
before sunrise tomorrow.

687
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,083
No!

688
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:12,041
Where's Ryo Saeba?

689
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:13,625
That's none of your business.

690
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:16,208
Stop bickering. Didn't he go to save you?

691
01:04:16,333 --> 01:04:17,500
Maybe he's been captured.

692
01:04:23,791 --> 01:04:26,250
It's up to us now.
We've got to save Ryo Saeba.

693
01:04:26,583 --> 01:04:30,166
-How do we fight? With our fingers?
-I have guns in my room.

694
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:45,208
He nearly killed Ryo Saeba
and me just now.

695
01:04:45,458 --> 01:04:47,291
We're not armed. We need to ambush him.

696
01:04:49,416 --> 01:04:50,416
I'll distract him.

697
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:52,375
Good idea!

698
01:04:52,458 --> 01:04:54,125
Let me try.

699
01:04:56,666 --> 01:04:58,666
Help her!

700
01:04:59,375 --> 01:05:00,625
No problem!

701
01:05:07,541 --> 01:05:11,458
I'm here to surrender. Don't kill me.

702
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,708
Do whatever you wish.

703
01:05:19,083 --> 01:05:21,833
I like strong men.

704
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,083
Hello, I'm very busy. Talk to you later.

705
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:47,083
You!

706
01:05:48,875 --> 01:05:51,291
I surrender. I like strong men, too.

707
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:54,250
You'll keep me company tonight.

708
01:05:54,916 --> 01:05:55,833
No way!

709
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:16,041
You smash the door down.
Kaori and I will rush in.

710
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:18,750
Will it hurt?

711
01:06:18,833 --> 01:06:20,500
Not really. Go on.

712
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:35,208
Charge!

713
01:06:45,833 --> 01:06:47,250
Duck!

714
01:06:58,458 --> 01:06:59,458
Don't move!

715
01:07:04,416 --> 01:07:05,250
Hit him!

716
01:07:09,375 --> 01:07:10,291
Let me.

717
01:07:16,458 --> 01:07:19,958
Dragon Claw!

718
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,458
That's really cruel.

719
01:07:29,458 --> 01:07:31,250
Change into something comfortable
and regroup.

720
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:32,500
Sure.

721
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:33,916
All right!

722
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:35,541
The men's room is that way.

723
01:07:35,833 --> 01:07:36,750
Right!

724
01:07:43,166 --> 01:07:44,500
Choose your weapon.

725
01:07:49,291 --> 01:07:50,875
Here. You take this.

726
01:07:51,708 --> 01:07:53,125
I don't know how to use it.

727
01:07:54,666 --> 01:07:55,666
I want this one.

728
01:07:57,250 --> 01:07:58,958
It's too heavy.

729
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:00,166
Move aside!

730
01:08:02,666 --> 01:08:04,083
Good!

731
01:08:05,833 --> 01:08:07,166
What are you doing in your pajamas?

732
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,333
You said to get
into something comfortable.

733
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:13,791
We'll split up
to save the hostages and Ryo Saeba.

734
01:08:14,041 --> 01:08:15,250
I'll rescue Ryo Saeba.

735
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:17,000
Let's go get the hostages.

736
01:08:17,083 --> 01:08:17,916
Okay.

737
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,208
We'll go and get Ryo.

738
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:31,875
Mr. Ryo Saeba, this is your last time
seeing the sun.

739
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:34,666
Everyone gets a last wish.

740
01:08:34,833 --> 01:08:35,666
Say it.

741
01:08:35,750 --> 01:08:38,791
Can I have wonton noodles? I'm starving.

742
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:41,875
He's insane.
He wants wonton noodles before he dies?

743
01:08:43,958 --> 01:08:45,416
Sorry! No.

744
01:08:45,833 --> 01:08:48,083
Damn Caucasian, you even said no to that.

745
01:08:50,833 --> 01:08:52,625
All right. Prepare for execution.

746
01:08:56,541 --> 01:08:57,375
Wait!

747
01:08:58,583 --> 01:08:59,958
What are you doing here?

748
01:09:00,916 --> 01:09:03,750
Nice to see you, princess.

749
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:05,416
Please let him go.

750
01:09:05,916 --> 01:09:07,583
You only want money.

751
01:09:07,958 --> 01:09:11,250
My father owns Imamura Publishing.

752
01:09:11,333 --> 01:09:13,416
I can ask him for lots of money.

753
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:15,625
Do you think I'll believe you?

754
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,625
You can call my dad's office.

755
01:09:18,041 --> 01:09:21,291
The number is 0252429.

756
01:09:22,166 --> 01:09:25,375
Remember the number
and call to check it out.

757
01:09:26,416 --> 01:09:28,166
Does he mean that much to you?

758
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:31,291
He's the best man that
I've ever met in my life.

759
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:37,541
We'll inform your father in Japan

760
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:39,666
about the news of this man's death.

761
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:41,333
You scumbag!

762
01:09:42,083 --> 01:09:43,583
Freeze!

763
01:09:45,541 --> 01:09:46,458
Drop your weapons!

764
01:09:46,541 --> 01:09:47,375
Let's go.

765
01:09:51,083 --> 01:09:52,833
I'm losing my balance again!

766
01:09:56,833 --> 01:09:58,333
-Get them!
-Yes, sir!

767
01:10:07,250 --> 01:10:08,916
-Catch!
-My hands are tied.

768
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:10,500
Are you okay?

769
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:11,833
Let's go.

770
01:10:17,416 --> 01:10:18,416
Give me the gun!

771
01:10:18,625 --> 01:10:19,458
Take it.

772
01:10:20,291 --> 01:10:21,291
Take it!

773
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:25,333
Shoot him!

774
01:10:32,500 --> 01:10:33,583
I'm not that heavy, right?

775
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:35,916
You're crushing me!

776
01:10:38,166 --> 01:10:39,000
Duck!

777
01:10:41,083 --> 01:10:42,000
Give me the gun!

778
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:45,791
Hide up there!

779
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:46,750
What?

780
01:10:46,958 --> 01:10:47,791
Come on!

781
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,833
-How?
-Follow me!

782
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:53,291
Get up!

783
01:11:00,666 --> 01:11:02,250
How silly. I forgot to untie the rope.

784
01:11:32,750 --> 01:11:33,750
Gosh.

785
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:29,666
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

786
01:13:33,666 --> 01:13:35,166
-What the hell?
-Let's go!

787
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,416
Thunder Strikers?

788
01:13:48,583 --> 01:13:49,875
AIR POLICE

789
01:14:05,958 --> 01:14:07,500
You go this way! You go that way!

790
01:14:07,583 --> 01:14:08,666
The rest of you follow me!

791
01:14:51,166 --> 01:14:52,083
Anyone here?

792
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,541
I told them not to go running around.

793
01:15:03,041 --> 01:15:04,208
Did you apply makeup?

794
01:15:05,958 --> 01:15:07,166
Untie me!

795
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:09,166
Behind you.

796
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:15,583
Untie me, quickly!

797
01:15:41,416 --> 01:15:43,000
Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku!

798
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:02,416
Round 1, fight!

799
01:16:35,041 --> 01:16:36,208
Dosu koi!

800
01:17:02,291 --> 01:17:03,375
Yoga Fire!

801
01:17:11,166 --> 01:17:12,000
Tiger!

802
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:18,875
Hadouken!

803
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,000
Sonic Boom!

804
01:17:20,083 --> 01:17:25,666
-Hadouken!
-Sonic Boom!

805
01:17:33,208 --> 01:17:34,833
Who's next?

806
01:17:37,250 --> 01:17:38,750
Spinning Bird Kick!

807
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:52,791
Shouryuuken!

808
01:17:52,875 --> 01:17:55,208
Shouryuuken!

809
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:06,291
Yatta!

810
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:07,875
Hadouken!

811
01:18:13,291 --> 01:18:15,708
-Tatsumaki Senpuukyaku!
-Spinning Bird Kick!

812
01:18:23,041 --> 01:18:26,291
Yatta!

813
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:30,083
Let's see what you can do
if I unplug this.

814
01:18:30,166 --> 01:18:31,166
Yes!

815
01:18:31,250 --> 01:18:32,083
It hurts!

816
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:34,125
Are you all right?

817
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:35,291
What happened?

818
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,458
I don't know.

819
01:18:36,541 --> 01:18:38,250
I know, he's dead.

820
01:18:38,333 --> 01:18:39,666
He's still alive!

821
01:18:39,750 --> 01:18:42,333
Good if he dies.

822
01:18:42,416 --> 01:18:45,125
Go to the upper deck.
The Thunder Strikers are here.

823
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:46,125
Let's go over there.

824
01:18:46,208 --> 01:18:47,333
-Wait!
-What?

825
01:18:47,416 --> 01:18:49,333
-Where's Kaori?
-She's gone to the casino.

826
01:18:49,666 --> 01:18:50,958
I'm going to the casino.

827
01:18:51,041 --> 01:18:52,208
I'm going to the casino.

828
01:18:52,500 --> 01:18:55,000
-Walk over there.
-What happened?

829
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:01,416
Hurry!

830
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,583
Hey, they're over there. Hurry!

831
01:19:10,416 --> 01:19:11,500
Careful! Split up!

832
01:19:17,583 --> 01:19:18,416
Get in!

833
01:19:50,500 --> 01:19:51,500
I'll take my chances.

834
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:04,750
Damn!

835
01:20:10,416 --> 01:20:11,250
Gundam!

836
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,833
Gundam.

837
01:20:50,375 --> 01:20:51,625
-How are you?
-I'm fine!

838
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:54,166
Thanks to your ace of hearts!

839
01:20:54,333 --> 01:20:55,833
The Thunder Strikers are here.

840
01:20:56,083 --> 01:20:57,625
Get to the upper deck with the hostages.

841
01:20:58,416 --> 01:20:59,250
What about you?

842
01:20:59,750 --> 01:21:01,750
I'm helping Ryo and Kaori in the casino.

843
01:21:01,958 --> 01:21:02,791
You all right?

844
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:06,250
I'm fine.

845
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:08,083
But next time, let's go on a date.

846
01:21:11,500 --> 01:21:12,458
Be careful!

847
01:21:12,541 --> 01:21:13,416
All right!

848
01:22:37,458 --> 01:22:39,333
Kaori!

849
01:22:39,416 --> 01:22:40,250
Ryo!

850
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:41,791
What?

851
01:22:42,041 --> 01:22:42,875
Watch out!

852
01:22:47,625 --> 01:22:48,708
You're out of bullets again?

853
01:22:49,500 --> 01:22:50,416
Don't worry!

854
01:23:10,583 --> 01:23:11,500
Ryo, behind us!

855
01:23:35,375 --> 01:23:36,291
Aren't we a team?

856
01:23:38,666 --> 01:23:39,583
Ryo!

857
01:23:40,666 --> 01:23:42,208
I've been waiting for you.

858
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:43,833
Don't move!

859
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:44,750
Don't move!

860
01:23:44,833 --> 01:23:45,750
Why are you holding her?

861
01:23:45,833 --> 01:23:47,375
She's my weapon!

862
01:23:47,458 --> 01:23:48,958
I bet she's your girlfriend.

863
01:23:50,625 --> 01:23:53,041
MacDonald, the Thunder Strikers are here.

864
01:23:53,291 --> 01:23:54,125
You can't get away.

865
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:57,375
I can still get away if you're my hostage.

866
01:24:05,333 --> 01:24:06,666
Let's make a deal.

867
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:08,250
If you get them to let me go,

868
01:24:08,333 --> 01:24:09,750
I'll let her go.

869
01:24:09,958 --> 01:24:10,875
Don't let him get away!

870
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:12,458
He badly injured my cousin.

871
01:24:12,541 --> 01:24:13,375
Where?

872
01:24:14,125 --> 01:24:16,875
I'm dying already.

873
01:24:19,541 --> 01:24:20,791
You're pathetic.

874
01:24:22,583 --> 01:24:24,000
Behind you!

875
01:24:42,958 --> 01:24:44,083
Thanks!

876
01:24:44,166 --> 01:24:45,250
I'm screwed again.

877
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:48,666
Goodbye, Ryo Saeba!

878
01:24:59,083 --> 01:25:03,250
You're finished!

879
01:25:03,333 --> 01:25:05,500
Don't kill me!
I have seven children to look after.

880
01:25:05,583 --> 01:25:06,416
Please don't kill me.

881
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:08,416
You asshole, 100 years in jail
is too kind for you.

882
01:25:08,500 --> 01:25:10,500
How about 200 years?

883
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:12,458
Look at you! Hold your ears!

884
01:25:12,541 --> 01:25:13,541
I will.

885
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:15,375
Repeat ten times that
you'll never do this again.

886
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:17,208
I dare not do it anymore.

887
01:25:17,291 --> 01:25:18,125
Can I go now?

888
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:19,583
In your dreams!

889
01:27:18,083 --> 01:27:20,083
Ryo Saeba, catch!

890
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,083
I shouldn't have done that.

891
01:27:39,041 --> 01:27:40,375
Catch!

892
01:27:40,458 --> 01:27:41,541
Over there!

893
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:58,166
Up. Down.

894
01:27:58,250 --> 01:27:59,166
Up. Left.

895
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:00,083
Right. Left.

896
01:28:00,166 --> 01:28:01,583
-Together.
-Whatever.

897
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:11,625
You can't hit me!

898
01:28:14,958 --> 01:28:15,791
Dodge!

899
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:22,833
You can't hit me!

900
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,291
Come on!

901
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:42,250
-Bastard!
-You still can't get me!

902
01:28:44,375 --> 01:28:45,208
Well?

903
01:30:14,041 --> 01:30:14,875
Come on!

904
01:30:58,041 --> 01:30:59,541
Goodbye, Ryo Saeba!

905
01:31:23,208 --> 01:31:24,375
Ryo Saeba!

906
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:29,333
Are you all right, Saeko?

907
01:31:29,416 --> 01:31:30,666
No, just a flesh wound.

908
01:31:31,000 --> 01:31:32,083
I'll carry you, all right?

909
01:31:32,208 --> 01:31:33,041
All right.

910
01:31:33,708 --> 01:31:35,208
-Ryo Saeba!
-Yes?

911
01:31:36,250 --> 01:31:37,250
Kaori.

912
01:31:38,666 --> 01:31:40,083
-Are you all right?
-It hurts!

913
01:31:40,166 --> 01:31:41,000
Where?

914
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:42,500
Everywhere!

915
01:31:42,583 --> 01:31:43,666
Let me carry you.

916
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:45,750
Better?

917
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:48,083
Good, all safe and sound.

918
01:31:48,250 --> 01:31:49,833
No, what about Shizuko?

919
01:31:50,958 --> 01:31:52,125
Damn! I forgot!

920
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:54,291
Hey, take care of Saeko for me.

921
01:31:55,333 --> 01:31:58,333
Ryo Saeba, you're pissing me off!

922
01:32:05,916 --> 01:32:06,750
Shizuko!

923
01:32:07,000 --> 01:32:08,000
Ryo Saeba!

924
01:32:09,375 --> 01:32:11,875
Shizuko, please don't run away again.

925
01:32:12,166 --> 01:32:15,750
I won't. I won't run away ever again.

926
01:32:17,416 --> 01:32:18,916
I'll do anything you say.

927
01:32:19,791 --> 01:32:21,208
-Really?
-Yes!

928
01:32:21,666 --> 01:32:24,583
Give me some wonton noodles.
I'm so hungry!

929
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:28,250
Ryo Saeba, are you all right?

930
01:32:42,833 --> 01:32:45,500
I'm most grateful to you, Mr. Ryu Saeba.

931
01:32:45,916 --> 01:32:46,750
It's my pleasure.

932
01:32:48,208 --> 01:32:49,041
Please, sit.

933
01:32:52,708 --> 01:32:53,708
Mr. Saeba.

934
01:32:54,208 --> 01:32:56,958
I would like a word with you in private.

935
01:32:58,208 --> 01:32:59,208
I'll wait outside.

936
01:33:03,583 --> 01:33:04,833
Me, too.

937
01:33:06,208 --> 01:33:07,208
I'll see you out!

938
01:33:16,250 --> 01:33:18,250
Hold my calls.

939
01:33:22,291 --> 01:33:23,375
Shizuko has changed

940
01:33:23,458 --> 01:33:25,875
since she came back from Hong Kong.

941
01:33:25,958 --> 01:33:28,041
It's all because of you.

942
01:33:28,125 --> 01:33:29,291
You flatter me!

943
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:30,916
I hope you'll marry her.

944
01:33:31,000 --> 01:33:33,833
You're the only one she'll listen to.

945
01:33:37,166 --> 01:33:38,583
She's my only child.

946
01:33:38,666 --> 01:33:40,250
My darling baby.

947
01:33:40,750 --> 01:33:42,500
The love of my life.

948
01:33:43,333 --> 01:33:44,500
When I retire,

949
01:33:44,583 --> 01:33:47,083
my son-in-law shall inherit everything.

950
01:33:47,333 --> 01:33:49,083
Shizuko is a pretty girl.

951
01:33:50,250 --> 01:33:52,083
I believe you wouldn't reject it.

952
01:34:07,875 --> 01:34:08,791
Why?

953
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,583
I'm too lazy.

954
01:34:10,833 --> 01:34:12,333
Besides, I can't be tied down.

955
01:34:12,500 --> 01:34:13,916
I'll never get married.

956
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:18,666
Your friend has just left in a hurry.

957
01:34:20,000 --> 01:34:21,083
Let her be.

958
01:34:21,791 --> 01:34:23,791
Thank you, Mr. Imamura.

959
01:34:25,000 --> 01:34:26,833
Pay my fee or I'll charge you interest!

960
01:34:34,583 --> 01:34:35,500
Where did she go?

961
01:34:35,666 --> 01:34:37,083
-She went that way.
-This way?

962
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:39,750
-What's your name, miss?
-Choi.

963
01:34:39,833 --> 01:34:40,666
Choi.

964
01:35:03,750 --> 01:35:06,458
Kaori, where are you going?

965
01:35:07,291 --> 01:35:08,541
This is for you.

966
01:35:10,458 --> 01:35:13,958
Don't be like that. Kaori, listen.

967
01:35:14,041 --> 01:35:15,208
I'm not listening.

968
01:35:15,291 --> 01:35:18,625
You're going to be his son-in-law and
you expect me to tag along as your maid?

969
01:35:19,708 --> 01:35:21,375
You know I hate sashimi.

970
01:35:21,750 --> 01:35:24,000
I only like congee and fried dough.

971
01:35:24,375 --> 01:35:26,458
Don't get mad! This is for you.

972
01:35:28,666 --> 01:35:29,500
Ryo Saeba!

973
01:35:35,041 --> 01:35:35,958
Ryo Saeba.

974
01:35:37,083 --> 01:35:38,000
Saeko.

975
01:35:39,708 --> 01:35:40,708
Do you have time?

976
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:41,833
Yes.

977
01:35:43,125 --> 01:35:44,875
Want to go with me to Disneyland?

978
01:35:45,375 --> 01:35:46,208
Sure!

979
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:48,500
What a nice flower!

980
01:35:48,708 --> 01:35:50,458
-It's for you.
-Thanks!

981
01:35:50,666 --> 01:35:53,708
Ryo Saeba!

982
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:02,375
Incredible!

983
01:36:05,625 --> 01:36:08,708
I'm dreaming again! Please don't wake me!

984
01:36:13,333 --> 01:36:16,083
Take turns!
