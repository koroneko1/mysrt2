00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:19.814
I have a question.

00:00:19.814 --> 00:00:22.679
What’s the first thing you’ll do when you go back?

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:23.935
Look for you.

00:00:23.935 --> 00:00:26.509
Because my dream is to be with you.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.744
We will meet for sure this time.

00:00:28.744 --> 00:00:30.790
We’re apart for now.

00:00:31.201 --> 00:00:34.397
But I hope one day, we will find our way back to each other.

00:00:34.397 --> 00:00:37.004
Promise me you won’t leave me again.

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:39.284
I don’t want you to disappear on me again.

00:00:39.284 --> 00:00:40.709
I will not leave you again.

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:41.593
I promise.

00:01:16.636 --> 00:01:18.636
Are we back to this universe again, Tess?

00:01:19.888 --> 00:01:20.590
Wait.

00:01:22.296 --> 00:01:23.594
You’re…

00:01:25.554 --> 00:01:26.489
Yes.

00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:28.470
I am…

00:01:31.063 --> 00:01:33.063
Puen!

00:01:33.582 --> 00:01:35.149
You’re fooled.

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:40.309
I knew you were fooling me.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.113
How can you be a famous actor?

00:01:43.575 --> 00:01:45.000
Your acting skills suck.

00:01:46.955 --> 00:01:49.184
I’m like this with you only.

00:01:49.876 --> 00:01:52.971
When I’m with you, I don’t act.

00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:56.489
Too early to be cheesy.

00:01:57.491 --> 00:01:59.033
I’ll go get something to eat.

00:01:59.033 --> 00:01:59.964
Hold on.

00:01:59.964 --> 00:02:00.870
What’s the rush?

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:01.799
It’s still early.

00:02:01.964 --> 00:02:03.786
I need to go to work.

00:02:04.014 --> 00:02:05.454
It starts at 10.

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:07.988
It’s just 7:30.

00:02:07.988 --> 00:02:10.655
We can do so much before that.

00:02:11.268 --> 00:02:15.814
May you tell me what you would like to do this morning then, Mr. Puen?

00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:19.807
Kiss you.

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.707
Damn you.

00:02:23.387 --> 00:02:24.391
Can I?

00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:26.700
What if I say no?

00:02:31.712 --> 00:02:32.923
I won’t do it.

00:02:34.201 --> 00:02:36.939
I will be sad for two days though.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.171
I will get better.

00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:40.527
Exaggerating.

00:02:43.092 --> 00:02:44.340
Come on.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:45.576
Can I?

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:51.330
I promise I’ll be as gentle as possible.

00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:55.081
How?

00:02:56.902 --> 00:02:59.182
Gentle but intense.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.118
I won’t hurt your lips.

00:03:10.831 --> 00:03:13.340
You don’t have to describe it.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:16.895
I’m feeling awkward.

00:03:18.877 --> 00:03:20.292
Then I’ll stop talking.

00:03:20.775 --> 00:03:21.907
I’ll just do it.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.304
I didn’t say you can do it.

00:03:28.012 --> 00:03:31.718
With that morning breath, I won’t let you kiss me.

00:03:34.556 --> 00:03:36.174
It’s not even bad.

00:03:36.398 --> 00:03:37.522
Please.

00:03:37.522 --> 00:03:39.365
No, Puen!

00:03:39.747 --> 00:03:41.200
Go brush your teeth.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.019
No.

00:03:46.443 --> 00:03:48.876
If I do, will I get to kiss you?

00:03:52.007 --> 00:03:52.974
No idea.

00:04:07.382 --> 00:04:09.382
Talay, what are you waiting for?

00:04:09.382 --> 00:04:10.561
Come brush your teeth.

00:04:11.241 --> 00:04:12.605
All right.

00:04:12.605 --> 00:04:13.440
I’m coming.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.466
Here.

00:04:22.063 --> 00:04:22.895
Wait.

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.169
Did you buy the same product Pakorn used?

00:04:27.197 --> 00:04:30.840
No. Pakorn had a lot in stock.

00:04:31.573 --> 00:04:32.951
It’s good.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:35.482
So I can brush my teeth very often.

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:38.979
And you won’t have any more excuses.

00:04:50.264 --> 00:04:51.216
What are you looking at?

00:04:51.445 --> 00:04:52.493
At you.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.000
I want to look at you all day.

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:12.019
Smells just great.

00:05:12.732 --> 00:05:15.377
No more excuses now.

00:05:15.377 --> 00:05:16.984
Not yet.

00:05:17.812 --> 00:05:20.000
I’m always hungry after brushing my teeth.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.560
It’s my body mechanism in the morning.

00:05:30.118 --> 00:05:31.838
Mechanism, my ass.

00:05:48.202 --> 00:05:50.558
Puen, what are you doing?

00:05:51.106 --> 00:05:52.419
Taking advantage of you.

00:05:55.001 --> 00:05:57.561
Wow. You know how to make it?

00:05:58.617 --> 00:05:59.673
Look.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.944
You like it?

00:06:02.128 --> 00:06:03.924
It might not exactly resemble.

00:06:04.788 --> 00:06:07.577
But it’s something to remind us of the old time.

00:06:09.028 --> 00:06:09.829
Yeah

00:06:11.822 --> 00:06:14.840
 but this is not enough.

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:26.040
This is better.

00:06:30.898 --> 00:06:32.898
Wow!

00:06:34.317 --> 00:06:37.921
If I get this every day, I won’t ask for anything anymore.

00:06:38.933 --> 00:06:40.755
Keep your word.

00:06:42.782 --> 00:06:43.974
I won’t ask.

00:06:44.254 --> 00:06:45.597
I’ll just do it.

00:06:50.443 --> 00:06:53.588
Whatever comes from you is so good.

00:06:59.193 --> 00:07:02.288
Thank you for coming back and searching for me.

00:07:06.062 --> 00:07:08.571
And thank you

00:07:11.034 --> 00:07:13.899
for taking away my fear of tomorrow.

00:07:16.685 --> 00:07:19.520
I thank you too

00:07:23.906 --> 00:07:25.906
for being born so that I could love you.

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:36.177
Please wait a moment.

00:08:36.177 --> 00:08:37.110
I’m almost there.

00:08:38.028 --> 00:08:38.984
Sure.

00:08:40.588 --> 00:08:41.581
See?

00:08:41.851 --> 00:08:43.880
I’m late for work because of you.

00:08:45.007 --> 00:08:45.999
I know.

00:08:46.177 --> 00:08:48.101
I’m taking responsibility here.

00:08:48.325 --> 00:08:50.240
Turn left or right?

00:08:50.342 --> 00:08:51.284
Left.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.119
What?

00:08:52.638 --> 00:08:53.697
Left.

00:08:53.901 --> 00:08:54.842
Huh?

00:08:55.719 --> 00:08:57.006
It’s noisy.

00:08:58.162 --> 00:09:00.380
Let me write it down on your palm.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:01.180
Here.

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:06.975
Left?

00:09:06.975 --> 00:09:08.020
Yeah!

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.382
Damn. I miss our time in that universe.

00:09:13.086 --> 00:09:16.206
Now you can write whatever you want on it.

00:09:16.333 --> 00:09:17.141
Really?

00:09:28.665 --> 00:09:30.760
Is it WTH?

00:09:32.903 --> 00:09:35.480
Are you cursing at me?

00:09:36.746 --> 00:09:38.400
You’re so bad.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:39.490
Alright, I lose.

00:09:39.602 --> 00:09:40.645
Reveal it.

00:09:42.453 --> 00:09:45.000
‘Where there’s you, there’s happiness.’

00:09:48.983 --> 00:09:50.398
You’re cheating.

00:09:50.508 --> 00:09:51.602
That’s not even the right initialism.

00:09:52.162 --> 00:09:53.679
Who would know it?

00:09:55.791 --> 00:09:56.933
Do you like it though?

00:09:57.162 --> 00:09:58.911
I like it so much.

00:10:01.014 --> 00:10:02.025
Woo!

00:10:02.763 --> 00:10:05.152
I have the energy to work today.

00:10:05.373 --> 00:10:06.520
Woo-hoo!

00:10:08.645 --> 00:10:09.899
Write again?

00:10:14.379 --> 00:10:15.532
Puen.

00:10:19.013 --> 00:10:21.013
It’s almost time for probation evaluation.

00:10:21.013 --> 00:10:22.469
So I just wanted to talk to you first.

00:10:23.235 --> 00:10:24.565
I didn’t pass?

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:25.852
Not really.

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:30.881
Actually, everyone likes your work.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.250
We love your color grading.

00:10:33.250 --> 00:10:39.882
However, we’re still concerned about you ditching the job so suddenly.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.924
Arm.

00:10:47.514 --> 00:10:48.903
To tell you the truth.

00:10:50.158 --> 00:10:51.623
I didn’t ditch the job.

00:10:53.688 --> 00:10:55.637
There was an accident.

00:10:56.658 --> 00:10:57.767
What accident?

00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:05.854
You wouldn’t believe me.

00:11:07.852 --> 00:11:14.332
I just want you to know that I’ve wanted to work for BFB all my life.

00:11:15.848 --> 00:11:17.746
And now I got that chance.

00:11:19.649 --> 00:11:23.480
Who would throw away the chance to work for the company he loves?

00:11:27.348 --> 00:11:29.195
You think I’m lying, don’t you?

00:11:31.882 --> 00:11:32.892
That’s okay.

00:11:34.165 --> 00:11:37.268
I don’t pass the probation. I get it.

00:11:41.621 --> 00:11:42.460
No.

00:11:44.702 --> 00:11:46.138
Actually,

00:11:47.258 --> 00:11:49.375
I believe every word you said.

00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:54.757
Talay,

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:56.513
I have a question.

00:11:59.902 --> 00:12:01.902
You died before, didn’t you?

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:11.374
Shit!

00:12:12.041 --> 00:12:14.041
We have this restaurant in our universe too?

00:12:14.143 --> 00:12:15.284
I miss this place.

00:12:15.284 --> 00:12:16.465
There you are.

00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:17.935
Hello.

00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:19.654
This is Puen.

00:12:22.077 --> 00:12:22.841
Okay.

00:12:24.597 --> 00:12:26.953
Actually, I’m only 16.

00:12:26.953 --> 00:12:27.547
What?

00:12:27.898 --> 00:12:31.731
I traveled here and woke up in a 40-year-old man’s body who’s a director.

00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:33.961
I feel fainty every time I have to climb the stairs.

00:12:34.681 --> 00:12:38.081
Let me take you to The Association of Universal Travellers of Thailand.

00:12:40.154 --> 00:12:44.343
There’s no certainty of when we will dream.

00:12:44.914 --> 00:12:49.052
So please don’t give up yet.

00:12:49.534 --> 00:12:53.189
I believe you all will get to go home.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:54.339
I do.

00:12:54.990 --> 00:12:56.914
I’m here for you.

00:12:57.034 --> 00:12:58.754
I hope you get to go home soon.

00:13:08.692 --> 00:13:11.634
All these times, I’d thought you were a job quitter.

00:13:12.196 --> 00:13:14.476
Now I get everything.

00:13:15.296 --> 00:13:17.520
I will talk to someone in BFB for you.

00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.416
Really?

00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:21.462
Thank you, big bro.

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:22.409
Little bro.

00:13:23.568 --> 00:13:24.508
Ah!

00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.838
Little bro.

00:13:37.615 --> 00:13:38.431
Goodbye.

00:13:38.431 --> 00:13:39.411
Hold on.

00:13:41.243 --> 00:13:42.149
What now?

00:13:43.396 --> 00:13:46.200
Are you going to stop me every time you drop me off?

00:13:47.524 --> 00:13:49.524
Well, I want to be with you as long as I can.

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:53.388
Did you forget something?

00:13:54.237 --> 00:13:55.145
Forget what?

00:13:57.385 --> 00:13:59.622
Forget to let me kiss you goodbye.

00:14:03.856 --> 00:14:05.474
Puen, you wicked ass.

00:14:07.039 --> 00:14:08.108
That feels so good.

00:14:08.592 --> 00:14:10.000
I’ll have such a sweet dream tonight.

00:14:12.071 --> 00:14:13.071
See you.

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.267
Go already.

00:14:23.325 --> 00:14:25.000
Bye-bye.

00:14:37.443 --> 00:14:38.292
Up!

00:14:38.852 --> 00:14:39.876
Tup!

00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:42.129
Did you get the snack I told you to grab?

00:14:42.129 --> 00:14:45.000
I’m so hungry I could eat a keyboard.

00:14:45.313 --> 00:14:47.920
Multiverse is so damn chaotic.

00:15:25.702 --> 00:15:26.541
Hi.

00:15:26.776 --> 00:15:27.937
Don’t you have work?

00:15:28.093 --> 00:15:29.212
Free enough to pick me up.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:30.592
I did.

00:15:31.087 --> 00:15:33.623
But I canceled them all just for you.

00:15:34.513 --> 00:15:36.513
You finally got the job.

00:15:36.513 --> 00:15:38.164
Of course, I’m taking you out to celebrate.

00:15:38.971 --> 00:15:40.528
I’m over the moon.

00:15:42.062 --> 00:15:42.980
This.

00:15:43.397 --> 00:15:44.479
Look at my employee ID card.

00:15:45.301 --> 00:15:46.071
Do I look hot?

00:15:48.157 --> 00:15:49.804
Let me see it up close.

00:15:53.246 --> 00:15:53.928
So?

00:15:53.928 --> 00:15:54.803
You’re hot.

00:15:55.163 --> 00:15:58.180
But I think you tried too much to pose.

00:15:58.817 --> 00:16:01.730
You look the best when you smile.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.368
That’s cute.

00:16:05.182 --> 00:16:06.262
Get in.

00:16:06.418 --> 00:16:07.338
We’re celebrating.

00:16:07.547 --> 00:16:08.310
Where?

00:16:09.192 --> 00:16:11.505
Anywhere you want.

00:16:13.318 --> 00:16:15.709
I want to eat good food.

00:16:22.862 --> 00:16:24.106
But you’re an actor.

00:16:25.208 --> 00:16:27.312
Can you dine at a simple restaurant?

00:16:30.108 --> 00:16:32.838
Now I believe you can.

00:16:34.178 --> 00:16:36.830
But where is everyone else?

00:16:37.031 --> 00:16:39.370
You said you wanted to eat at a simple restaurant.

00:16:39.616 --> 00:16:42.320
It’s all yours today.

00:16:42.957 --> 00:16:44.149
Gosh.

00:16:44.546 --> 00:16:46.129
I know you’re loaded.

00:16:46.901 --> 00:16:48.275
But isn’t it too much?

00:16:49.795 --> 00:16:51.440
It’s not.

00:16:51.843 --> 00:16:54.234
I’ve always wanted to do this with you.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:57.053
But I didn’t have much money in that universe.

00:17:00.059 --> 00:17:00.873
Here,

00:17:01.421 --> 00:17:04.276
everything I ordered is your favorite.

00:17:06.801 --> 00:17:07.724
Damn!

00:17:09.315 --> 00:17:10.496
Pink drink.

00:17:11.248 --> 00:17:12.935
Delightful!

00:17:13.608 --> 00:17:14.396
Wait.

00:17:15.022 --> 00:17:16.755
Who drinks it like that?

00:17:18.798 --> 00:17:19.492
Oh.

00:17:20.509 --> 00:17:21.623
How do you drink it then?

00:17:22.576 --> 00:17:23.391
Come here.

00:17:24.225 --> 00:17:25.306
What are you doing?

00:17:26.951 --> 00:17:29.655
Three, two, one.

00:17:45.513 --> 00:17:46.992
You just made my day.

00:17:47.296 --> 00:17:49.296
Your day isn't over yet.

00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:52.073
There’s one more menu left.

00:18:01.746 --> 00:18:05.076
I’m proudly presenting you with the special menu.

00:18:05.379 --> 00:18:06.414
Hold on.

00:18:06.775 --> 00:18:08.775
This is like a scene in movies.

00:18:08.905 --> 00:18:11.819
Don’t tell me I’d find a ring once I open it.

00:18:14.129 --> 00:18:15.190
Right.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.303
Why didn’t I think of that?

00:18:17.829 --> 00:18:21.341
Let me change it to a ring then.

00:18:22.912 --> 00:18:24.078
It isn’t?

00:18:36.944 --> 00:18:38.396
Where did you get it from?

00:18:39.055 --> 00:18:40.742
It isn’t just a folder.

00:18:41.155 --> 00:18:42.581
Open it.

00:19:14.241 --> 00:19:18.275
I thought I’d ask you to draw it for me again at first.

00:19:18.963 --> 00:19:25.682
But then I realized I remembered all the lines you drew.

00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:29.241
Well, well.

00:19:32.421 --> 00:19:34.421
Are you bragging you have a very good memory?

00:19:35.915 --> 00:19:36.745
No.

00:19:37.788 --> 00:19:41.305
I’m bragging I’m so drunk in love with you.

00:19:56.847 --> 00:19:59.968
Puen, most questions will be about your movie.

00:19:59.968 --> 00:20:01.750
Promote it all you want.

00:20:03.239 --> 00:20:04.082
All right.

00:20:04.082 --> 00:20:05.308
I’m coming.

00:20:05.308 --> 00:20:06.305
What’s up, Puen?

00:20:06.305 --> 00:20:07.291
Hello, O.

00:20:07.291 --> 00:20:08.356

00:20:08.486 --> 00:20:09.509
Can I get a hug?

00:20:10.534 --> 00:20:11.960
- Have you been well?
- I have.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:12.915
Are you ready for it?

00:20:12.915 --> 00:20:13.415
I am.

00:20:13.415 --> 00:20:14.472
Okay. Let’s roll.

00:20:14.472 --> 00:20:16.112

00:20:16.776 --> 00:20:17.898
Yes.

Five, four, three, two, one…queue!

00:20:50.479 --> 00:20:51.300
Alright, Puen.

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.388
Now that you’re here with me, I have to ask.

00:20:54.388 --> 00:20:56.785
People really want to know.

00:20:57.281 --> 00:21:00.689
There is a picture leaked on Twitter.

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.561
People are saying the guy in the pic is you.

00:21:04.561 --> 00:21:07.714
Guys, show us the picture.

00:21:09.060 --> 00:21:11.738
That’s the one.

00:21:11.738 --> 00:21:15.712
Netizens are thinking this guy is you.

00:21:15.921 --> 00:21:17.064
What do you say?

00:21:21.072 --> 00:21:22.076
Hold on.

00:21:22.389 --> 00:21:24.089

We will get to that.

00:21:28.438 --> 00:21:29.969
But let’s do this first.

00:21:29.969 --> 00:21:31.307
That’s not it.

00:21:31.307 --> 00:21:38.452
Netizens are saying the other guy is your former manager.

00:21:38.745 --> 00:21:40.328
So Puen…

00:21:41.042 --> 00:21:43.876
are you in a relationship with your ex-manager?

00:21:48.981 --> 00:21:52.467
I think we should talk about the movie first.

00:21:52.641 --> 00:21:55.475
We’ve strayed way out of the topic.

00:21:55.475 --> 00:21:57.038
Oops!

00:21:57.328 --> 00:21:59.849
Alright then.

00:22:20.407 --> 00:22:21.859
I’m sorry--

00:22:23.002 --> 00:22:25.289
That’s why you were gone.

00:22:25.289 --> 00:22:27.064
You were seeing him.

00:22:27.331 --> 00:22:28.888
Why didn’t you tell me then?

00:22:29.357 --> 00:22:30.177
Wait.

00:22:30.931 --> 00:22:32.035
Aren’t you mad at me?

00:22:32.478 --> 00:22:33.922
Why would I be?

00:22:35.222 --> 00:22:38.369
Whoever Puen is seeing is his personal business.

00:22:38.369 --> 00:22:40.603
I’m his fan, not the master of his life.

00:22:45.427 --> 00:22:46.388
Thank you.

00:22:47.890 --> 00:22:49.369
Thank you for your understanding.

00:22:50.554 --> 00:22:51.682
But I’m a shipper.

00:22:54.968 --> 00:22:57.170
How is it though?

00:22:58.967 --> 00:23:00.053
Normal.

00:23:01.623 --> 00:23:03.189
You’re not acting normal.

00:23:05.583 --> 00:23:08.104
No. I’m always like this.

00:23:09.037 --> 00:23:10.043
Isn’t that hot?

00:23:15.597 --> 00:23:16.982
You’re turning red.

00:23:33.047 --> 00:23:34.028
Who are you calling?

00:23:35.619 --> 00:23:36.638
Talay.

00:23:37.084 --> 00:23:37.860
You can’t.

00:23:38.538 --> 00:23:42.396
I don’t know what the relationship between you and Talay is.

00:23:43.053 --> 00:23:46.623
But you’re being watched by the media.

00:23:46.776 --> 00:23:50.132
So contacting Talay is prohibited.

00:23:50.584 --> 00:23:53.053
It’s affecting your airing movie.

00:23:56.624 --> 00:23:57.936

at least let me talk to him for a second.

00:24:01.866 --> 00:24:03.397
I talked to the management team.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.542
Your phone will be in my care for a while.

00:24:09.226 --> 00:24:11.409
Do not contact anyone until the news dies out.

00:24:12.399 --> 00:24:13.825
I’m sorry about this.

I’m from an editing team.

00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:24.309
You mistook me for someone else.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:27.879
I’m sorry.

00:26:28.687 --> 00:26:29.522
Tup!

00:26:30.699 --> 00:26:32.699
Did you get the snack I told you to grab?

00:26:33.435 --> 00:26:35.983
I’m so hungry I could eat a keyboard.

00:26:36.493 --> 00:26:38.076
Keep it down, Tou.

00:26:38.491 --> 00:26:40.282
You don’t have to speak so loud.

00:26:40.803 --> 00:26:41.607
Here.

00:26:48.092 --> 00:26:49.544
You were about to grab one.

00:26:49.544 --> 00:26:50.151
Here.

00:26:52.405 --> 00:26:53.255
Thank you.

00:26:53.255 --> 00:26:53.962
Sure.

00:27:07.776 --> 00:27:08.883
Nothing.

00:27:09.535 --> 00:27:11.341
Someone I know loves this so much.

00:27:12.594 --> 00:27:13.400
Ah!

00:27:13.609 --> 00:27:14.699
Thank you, Up.

00:27:15.259 --> 00:27:16.379
It’s Tup.

00:27:17.683 --> 00:27:18.824
Jomtup.

00:27:19.402 --> 00:27:21.793
Ah, Jomtup.

00:27:21.793 --> 00:27:23.215
Yes, I’m Jomtup.

00:27:25.566 --> 00:27:26.295
Damn.

00:27:27.286 --> 00:27:29.730
Multiverse is so damn chaotic.

00:27:30.654 --> 00:27:34.766
Are you guys close?

00:27:34.766 --> 00:27:35.576
That’s right.

00:27:37.445 --> 00:27:39.966
This is Tou from the editing team as well.

00:27:40.248 --> 00:27:42.013
We joined around the same time.

00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:45.791
Wait.

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:48.128
Are you Talay?

00:27:49.856 --> 00:27:50.634
Yes.

00:27:52.772 --> 00:27:54.098
Do you two know me?

00:27:55.503 --> 00:27:57.060
Of course, we do.

00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:00.344
The news about you and Puen dating is all over the place.

00:28:07.386 --> 00:28:08.601
About that…

00:28:08.601 --> 00:28:09.803
It’s all good.

00:28:10.298 --> 00:28:12.115
We kind of figured it out.

00:28:12.893 --> 00:28:15.102
Puen is pretty obvious about it.

00:28:16.342 --> 00:28:17.010
Huh?

00:28:18.627 --> 00:28:19.490
How?

00:28:20.395 --> 00:28:21.667
A while ago,

00:28:22.110 --> 00:28:24.194
Puen came here asking for you every day.

00:28:25.707 --> 00:28:26.667
Excuse me.

00:28:26.667 --> 00:28:29.637
Is there any employee named Talay here?

00:28:40.535 --> 00:28:42.978
We could see it in his eyes he’s so in love.

00:28:44.892 --> 00:28:47.544
Tou, don’t tease him.

00:28:49.115 --> 00:28:50.303
It’s okay, Talay.

00:28:51.398 --> 00:28:52.731
We won’t tell anyone.

00:28:53.767 --> 00:28:54.933
You can trust us.

00:28:56.623 --> 00:29:00.109

00:29:00.553 --> 00:29:01.386
But hang in there.

We’re rooting for you, man.

00:29:05.782 --> 00:29:06.765
Thank you.

00:29:14.499 --> 00:29:17.177
Are you Talay?

00:29:17.177 --> 00:29:19.320
May we get an interview?
Please answer some questions.

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:20.223
I…

00:29:20.585 --> 00:29:23.341
Are you the guy in that picture with Puen?

00:29:23.341 --> 00:29:24.205
Are you?

00:29:24.205 --> 00:29:26.599
Is that right?

00:29:27.225 --> 00:29:28.096
I am.

00:29:28.908 --> 00:29:30.256
The guy in that picture is me.

00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:34.107
Did Puen really kiss you on the cheek?

00:29:35.055 --> 00:29:36.794
He did.

00:29:37.995 --> 00:29:39.995
Are they dating?

00:29:40.249 --> 00:29:45.248
But it was just two old colleagues playing with each other.

00:29:47.245 --> 00:29:54.590
I confirm here Puen and I are just two good friends.

00:29:55.793 --> 00:29:56.861
Will you excuse me?

00:29:56.861 --> 00:29:59.045
Please wait a minute. Excuse me.

00:29:59.587 --> 00:30:05.707
So he just made it clear they’re only friends.

00:30:10.309 --> 00:30:13.355
Someone asked me before between love and work…

00:30:13.746 --> 00:30:14.856
What I would choose?

00:30:15.195 --> 00:30:18.562
Ask me countless times and my answer will be the same.

00:30:54.520 --> 00:30:55.261
Hey.

00:30:55.799 --> 00:30:58.115
Why did you say that to the press?

00:30:58.115 --> 00:30:59.705
Don’t you love Puen anymore?

00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:04.177
I love him. That’s why I said it.

00:31:05.234 --> 00:31:10.584
Would you let someone you love lose his job because of you?

00:31:14.727 --> 00:31:16.368
I get you.

00:31:16.729 --> 00:31:18.250
But what are you going to do now?

00:31:19.531 --> 00:31:20.581
Nothing.

00:31:21.399 --> 00:31:23.725
Going separate ways is a good way out.

00:31:41.004 --> 00:31:41.855
Puen.

00:31:41.855 --> 00:31:43.015
Hold on, girl.

00:31:43.317 --> 00:31:45.217
Puen is filming a show today.

00:31:45.217 --> 00:31:46.828
No fans assembling here.

00:31:46.828 --> 00:31:49.262
He will see you at the next open event, okay?

00:31:49.262 --> 00:31:52.839
But this is a present from me. 
Can you please accept it?

00:31:52.976 --> 00:31:54.052
But it’s a private event…

00:31:54.052 --> 00:31:54.836
Prikyuak.

00:31:56.158 --> 00:31:57.026
It’s okay.

00:31:58.242 --> 00:31:59.175
Thank you.

00:31:59.175 --> 00:32:00.103
Thanks, honey.

00:32:00.524 --> 00:32:02.983
Next time, come to an open event.

00:32:03.856 --> 00:32:05.557
You must open it.

00:32:09.948 --> 00:32:11.005
We have more fans waiting.

00:32:11.264 --> 00:32:14.600
These kids. I told them it’s a private event today and yet they came.

00:32:14.954 --> 00:32:15.835
Ready, Puen?

00:32:16.314 --> 00:32:21.575
The question is if you face the same situation as the guy in the movie,

00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.837
what would you choose?

00:32:23.135 --> 00:32:24.955
Work or love?

00:32:46.274 --> 00:32:47.456
There you are.

00:32:53.296 --> 00:32:55.097
Hey, I’ve got something to ask you.

00:32:55.808 --> 00:32:59.004
Mountain and sea, what will you choose?

00:32:59.393 --> 00:33:00.835
Sea, of course.

00:33:01.278 --> 00:33:02.456
My name answers it all.

00:33:03.278 --> 00:33:06.373
What about white and pink?

00:33:06.797 --> 00:33:07.648
No doubt.

00:33:07.748 --> 00:33:09.435
Pink.

00:33:11.428 --> 00:33:13.209
Your smile is so sweet.

00:33:17.268 --> 00:33:20.105
My turn to ask you.

00:33:20.504 --> 00:33:21.186
Shoot.

00:33:23.618 --> 00:33:29.845
Between work and love, what will you choose?

00:33:32.662 --> 00:33:35.320
Love, of course.

00:33:36.344 --> 00:33:37.075
No.

00:33:38.344 --> 00:33:39.394
I’m serious here.

00:33:42.611 --> 00:33:46.126
Without your job, you won’t have money.

00:33:48.128 --> 00:33:49.550
Without money,

00:33:51.575 --> 00:33:53.575
it’s hard to take care of the one you love.

00:33:59.324 --> 00:34:00.532
I’ll let you answer again.

00:34:03.104 --> 00:34:04.315
What will you choose?

00:34:05.504 --> 00:34:06.815
For me, I choose…

00:34:06.815 --> 00:34:09.383
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt.

00:34:09.383 --> 00:34:10.825
Just a second, please.

00:34:11.996 --> 00:34:12.743
Puen.

00:34:14.578 --> 00:34:15.532
Have you seen this?

00:34:16.868 --> 00:34:18.350
He did kiss my cheek.

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:23.492
But it was just two old colleagues playing with each other.

00:34:25.631 --> 00:34:32.815
I confirm here Puen and I are just two good friends.

00:34:43.896 --> 00:34:44.532
Puen,

00:34:46.945 --> 00:34:47.800
seriously.

00:34:48.969 --> 00:34:50.115
Are you and Talay a thing?

00:34:52.822 --> 00:34:54.087
Not just a thing.

00:34:54.725 --> 00:34:57.155
We’re way more connected than that.

00:34:57.532 --> 00:35:00.409
But you know well what this showbiz is like, Puen.

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:04.291
I don’t want to butt in.

00:35:05.643 --> 00:35:08.480
But just forget about it.

00:35:10.036 --> 00:35:10.702
Please.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:13.790
It’s good you two are apart.

00:35:19.009 --> 00:35:20.750
These are the presents from your fans.

00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:22.427
Don’t open them yet. Go to bed.

00:35:22.770 --> 00:35:23.657
Take a good rest.

00:35:24.475 --> 00:35:26.575
You will answer the press about Talay in the morning.

00:35:28.217 --> 00:35:29.758
I’ll handle the script.

00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:33.248
Bye.

00:36:33.213 --> 00:36:34.635
Hello, Puen.

00:36:34.839 --> 00:36:36.759
I’m Talay’s friend.

00:36:36.759 --> 00:36:38.290
He’s with me right now.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.541
I didn’t want to say that.

00:36:43.433 --> 00:36:47.128
I did it because I love him so much.

00:36:48.282 --> 00:36:50.501
I don’t want his career to be ruined because of me.

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:53.281
But damn.

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:57.511
My heart is aching so damn much.

00:36:59.012 --> 00:37:00.394
Did you hear that?

00:37:00.838 --> 00:37:03.875
I just want you to know that my friend always loves you.

00:37:04.756 --> 00:37:06.756
I miss our time together.

00:37:07.554 --> 00:37:09.315
Can we go back to that universe?

00:37:09.815 --> 00:37:10.560
Hey!

00:37:12.753 --> 00:37:14.008
You’re too drunk.

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.537
I’m ending it here, Puen.

00:37:15.537 --> 00:37:16.260
Bye.

00:37:27.926 --> 00:37:29.089
Handle it well.

00:37:32.115 --> 00:37:34.115
Follow the script the management team prepared for you.

00:37:34.552 --> 00:37:36.552
Don’t go off it. Got it?

00:37:43.405 --> 00:37:44.522
Hey!

00:37:46.117 --> 00:37:48.755
Hello, everyone.

00:37:48.755 --> 00:37:50.039
Hi.

00:37:51.693 --> 00:37:55.268
I'm here to confirm that the man in the picture is me.

00:37:57.925 --> 00:38:02.079
Talay said it was just two friends playing.

00:38:02.228 --> 00:38:04.088
What would you say about this, Puen?

00:38:05.726 --> 00:38:06.419
That’s right.

00:38:06.419 --> 00:38:07.965
We were just playing.

00:38:16.433 --> 00:38:19.410
But my feelings for him are real.

00:38:20.324 --> 00:38:21.227
Whoa.

00:38:22.219 --> 00:38:24.295
So it’s true?

00:38:24.295 --> 00:38:27.793
So are you and Talay boyfriends?

00:38:28.177 --> 00:38:28.820
Are you?

00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:30.995
Is that right?

00:38:30.995 --> 00:38:32.386
How long have you been together?
Please answer the question.

00:38:33.243 --> 00:38:34.204
Not yet.

00:38:35.859 --> 00:38:39.052
But he’s the one I have good feelings for.

00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:42.588
And I want to learn about him for as long as I can.

00:38:48.350 --> 00:38:54.258
Someone asked me before what I would choose between love and work.

00:38:56.110 --> 00:38:59.406
Ask me countless times and my answer will be the same.

00:39:00.421 --> 00:39:01.417
I choose love.

00:39:02.753 --> 00:39:05.093
Without work, I can survive.

00:39:06.332 --> 00:39:07.407
Without him,

00:39:08.703 --> 00:39:09.628
I can’t.

00:39:22.830 --> 00:39:26.335
Do you want to know the wish I want to write down the most now?

00:39:26.834 --> 00:39:27.550
I do.

00:40:09.475 --> 00:40:11.475
What’s that look on your face?

00:40:12.023 --> 00:40:14.287
Puen told everyone about you.

00:40:14.287 --> 00:40:15.423
You should be happy.

00:40:16.157 --> 00:40:17.933
I’m happy.

00:40:18.836 --> 00:40:21.348
But afraid there’s an impact on his job.

00:40:22.344 --> 00:40:24.152
Especially now that his movie is airing.

00:40:25.098 --> 00:40:26.938
Don’t worry just yet.

00:40:28.823 --> 00:40:31.097
Let me check its feedback on Twitter.

00:40:35.841 --> 00:40:37.097
Shit!

00:40:37.520 --> 00:40:39.008
My mom is messaging me.

00:40:39.008 --> 00:40:41.661
Telling me to go home immediately. She needs to talk to me.

00:40:42.961 --> 00:40:45.217
So she knows about this?

00:40:45.727 --> 00:40:47.184
Will she say anything?

00:40:48.031 --> 00:40:50.319
I’ve never told my family about this.

00:40:52.639 --> 00:40:54.287
I’m sure it’ll be fine.

00:40:54.733 --> 00:40:56.221
I’ll go with you.

00:41:08.945 --> 00:41:12.703
Puen is right there sitting on my friend’s couch.

00:41:14.433 --> 00:41:16.433
Gyo, calm down.

00:41:17.695 --> 00:41:20.398
Puen, what are you doing here?

00:41:21.564 --> 00:41:23.564
I told the press about you.

00:41:23.564 --> 00:41:25.366
I’m here to take responsibility for my action.

00:41:26.641 --> 00:41:30.016
Mom, I’m taking this chance to ask for your permission.

00:41:32.271 --> 00:41:33.248
Wait.

00:41:33.472 --> 00:41:34.847
What are you asking?

00:41:38.442 --> 00:41:40.858
Asking if I could…

00:41:42.004 --> 00:41:43.908
Take you out of town.

00:41:46.304 --> 00:41:47.569
Can I, Mom?

00:41:47.712 --> 00:41:49.097
Of course, you can.

00:41:49.097 --> 00:41:53.218
You can take him out of town, out of the country, or out of the universe.

00:41:53.218 --> 00:41:54.187
I don’t mind.

00:41:54.987 --> 00:41:57.882
Mom, aren’t you worried about me at all?

00:41:57.882 --> 00:42:00.257
How old are you, eight?

00:42:02.091 --> 00:42:03.931
Your mom gave us permission.

00:42:04.569 --> 00:42:06.026
You can’t say no.

00:42:07.098 --> 00:42:11.911
Someone like you would just drag me with you even though I said no.

00:42:11.911 --> 00:42:16.158
Puen, you’re welcome to eat here whenever you want.

00:42:16.158 --> 00:42:17.615
Just let Talay know.

00:42:18.666 --> 00:42:20.410
Thank you, Mom.

00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:23.718
I guess I’ll stop by to eat here quite often.

00:42:23.718 --> 00:42:24.563
Sure.

00:42:25.049 --> 00:42:26.921
Can I come too?

00:42:26.921 --> 00:42:30.724
I’m so overjoyed seeing these two together.

00:42:31.555 --> 00:42:32.667
Girl.

00:42:33.762 --> 00:42:37.297
What a shame I didn’t prepare anything today.

00:42:37.881 --> 00:42:39.529
You won’t get to try my recipe today.

00:42:39.816 --> 00:42:43.351
Can I borrow your kitchen for a day then?

00:42:44.086 --> 00:42:44.934
Yes.

00:42:45.881 --> 00:42:49.511
And can I borrow Talay for a moment?

00:42:50.195 --> 00:42:51.428
Take him.

00:42:53.355 --> 00:42:54.531
What are you doing?

00:42:54.659 --> 00:42:55.899
Cook.

00:42:56.411 --> 00:42:57.568
Let’s go.

00:43:01.138 --> 00:43:02.339
Your son is stubborn.

00:43:02.851 --> 00:43:03.898
Go.

00:43:06.783 --> 00:43:08.783
Cooking time.

00:43:08.968 --> 00:43:11.224
What should we make here?

00:43:19.097 --> 00:43:19.957
Talay.

00:43:20.628 --> 00:43:21.768
Do you want this?

00:43:22.284 --> 00:43:23.389
Good idea.

00:43:23.739 --> 00:43:25.739
I want to eat chef Puen’s food.

00:43:36.044 --> 00:43:37.341
Hurry up. I’m hungry.

00:43:37.341 --> 00:43:38.496
Here. Eat it now.

00:43:38.496 --> 00:43:40.077
It’s still hot.

00:43:45.454 --> 00:43:46.623
Here you go.

00:43:47.687 --> 00:43:49.687
Wow!

00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:53.480
I’ll eat now.

00:44:06.948 --> 00:44:08.149
Do you want some?

00:44:12.632 --> 00:44:14.312
Yum!

00:44:16.847 --> 00:44:18.463
With egg whites.

00:44:22.353 --> 00:44:24.097
Full bite.

00:44:25.282 --> 00:44:26.419
Is it good?

00:44:30.154 --> 00:44:31.579
You helped me cook.

00:44:31.865 --> 00:44:33.417
That’s why it’s so good.

00:44:47.446 --> 00:44:49.989
Phi Puen, can you feed Talay, please?

00:44:50.677 --> 00:44:52.677
Yum!

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:56.124
It’s messy.

00:44:56.626 --> 00:44:59.297
You’re such a good cook, Phi Puen.

00:44:59.297 --> 00:45:02.067
Your lover is so lucky to have you.

00:45:02.067 --> 00:45:03.666
Just eat. Stop talking.

00:45:11.287 --> 00:45:14.854
Finally, we get to see the same moon.

00:45:15.429 --> 00:45:16.518
Yes.

00:45:17.316 --> 00:45:19.700
I didn’t need to look at it and imagine your face anymore.

00:45:24.623 --> 00:45:26.835
It’s time to go home.

00:45:30.883 --> 00:45:32.499
I don’t want to leave you.

00:45:34.032 --> 00:45:35.297
Don’t be too clingy.

00:45:35.615 --> 00:45:38.510
We will meet again in just a few hours.

00:45:40.755 --> 00:45:42.627
No. It’s too many hours until we meet again.

00:46:03.283 --> 00:46:05.219
When did you have it made?

00:46:05.967 --> 00:46:06.912
I didn’t.

00:46:08.191 --> 00:46:10.141
I brought it between universes with me.

00:46:18.344 --> 00:46:20.184
You totally fell for it.

00:46:21.591 --> 00:46:22.907
But look.

00:46:28.214 --> 00:46:29.464
The sand doesn’t go…

00:46:29.464 --> 00:46:31.097
Do you have any idea

00:46:32.732 --> 00:46:35.787
how long I waited for you to travel back here?

00:46:38.703 --> 00:46:43.097
I don’t want time to go by without you from now on.

00:46:47.732 --> 00:46:49.732
I want to stop time right here.

00:46:51.489 --> 00:46:53.809
I want to stop our universal traveling.

00:46:56.363 --> 00:46:57.979
Just like the sand in this hourglass.

00:47:41.796 --> 00:47:47.377
From this moment on, it’s you and me.

00:47:47.377 --> 00:47:48.765
Talay and Puen.

00:47:50.687 --> 00:47:52.335
You’re such a baby.

00:48:45.451 --> 00:48:47.099
I miss this place.

00:48:49.627 --> 00:48:54.440
Lucky us we have it here in this universe too.

00:48:56.133 --> 00:48:57.590
Why did you want to come here?

00:49:00.433 --> 00:49:02.817
Because it’s the place I left you behind that day.

00:49:04.742 --> 00:49:09.076
So today I took you here to tell you

00:49:09.449 --> 00:49:11.449
no matter what happens from now on

00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:14.204
I will never leave you again.

00:49:24.111 --> 00:49:28.029
I kind of miss that universe.

00:49:29.547 --> 00:49:32.059
Wondering how everyone is doing.

00:49:33.815 --> 00:49:34.870
Right.

00:49:35.382 --> 00:49:36.902
I miss it a lot.

00:49:38.571 --> 00:49:39.957
I miss Dol,

00:49:40.852 --> 00:49:42.105
Up,

00:49:42.904 --> 00:49:43.891
Aou,

00:49:45.298 --> 00:49:46.695
Kita and Fuse.

00:49:47.814 --> 00:49:49.097
I miss the association.

00:49:51.635 --> 00:49:53.347
I miss this too.

00:49:54.034 --> 00:49:56.034
The password to enter the association building.

00:49:56.034 --> 00:49:57.715
We needed to say it every time.

00:49:58.575 --> 00:50:02.078
Right. I barely got some of them right.

00:50:02.575 --> 00:50:06.301
Let’s play the association password guessing game.

00:50:07.097 --> 00:50:10.120
I will start the first sentence and you finish it.

00:50:11.257 --> 00:50:13.097
Let’s do it.

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:18.836
Keep looking at me like that…

00:50:18.836 --> 00:50:20.679
And I’ll kiss till you drop.

00:50:21.205 --> 00:50:22.598
You’re not a movie…

00:50:22.598 --> 00:50:24.086
You are real.

00:50:24.332 --> 00:50:25.401
Do you want to try?

00:50:26.616 --> 00:50:28.250
Try to get to know each other.

00:50:29.936 --> 00:50:31.712
You don’t have to like me very much.

00:50:31.712 --> 00:50:32.837
Just keep…

00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.000
Just keep your heart open for me.

00:50:47.095 --> 00:50:48.647
You said it all.

00:50:48.871 --> 00:50:50.423
There's nothing left for me to say.

00:50:50.947 --> 00:50:52.595
Just answer the last question.

00:50:52.595 --> 00:50:54.409
Yes or no?

00:50:57.126 --> 00:50:58.201
No.

00:51:04.966 --> 00:51:09.140
Because I opened my heart to you a long time ago, dumbass.

00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:27.015
So you’re officially my boyfriend from this moment on, dummy.

00:51:27.654 --> 00:51:28.761
Sure.

00:51:55.764 --> 00:52:01.792
If our lives were like a movie, it would be our happy ending right here.

00:52:01.792 --> 00:52:06.189
But we all know life always goes on.

00:52:06.189 --> 00:52:07.301
This scene first.

00:52:07.722 --> 00:52:10.074
Puen's life as an actor, for instance.

00:52:10.074 --> 00:52:12.837
He’s so in love he can't even focus on this job.

00:52:15.073 --> 00:52:20.334
Some nights, I dream about my friends in that universe.

00:52:20.556 --> 00:52:25.097
I see Up and Aou become the most wanted screenwriters in my dream.

00:52:25.097 --> 00:52:27.296
They’re given many rewards.

00:52:28.133 --> 00:52:31.763
Kita becomes a sensational actor.

00:52:31.763 --> 00:52:33.530
Always striking poses for people to take his photos.

00:52:35.023 --> 00:52:38.334
Fuse is taking an acting class overseas.

00:52:38.334 --> 00:52:39.746
Waiting to be a world-class actor.

00:52:39.746 --> 00:52:41.041
Fighting!!

00:52:41.041 --> 00:52:44.538
Sometimes I dream about him coming back to Thailand.

00:52:44.538 --> 00:52:47.474
And he’s always with Aou.

00:52:48.598 --> 00:52:50.598
I’m wondering what’s going on between these two.

00:52:51.226 --> 00:52:54.761
Pong’s bar becomes famous.

00:52:54.761 --> 00:52:58.366
I guess it’s because Kita, the hot actor, loves to come here.

00:52:59.067 --> 00:53:04.903
Not just that, Tess and Pakorn join forces with Aou and Up to write film screenplays once again.

00:53:04.903 --> 00:53:07.278
And the plot is so familiar.

00:53:07.278 --> 00:53:10.791
Their film is called Vice Versa.

00:53:14.015 --> 00:53:16.335
I dream about those friends so often.

00:53:16.335 --> 00:53:19.771
But what’s weird is that I never dream of Phuwadol.

00:53:20.151 --> 00:53:21.288
[Phuwadol]

00:53:21.672 --> 00:53:22.606
Sorry.

00:53:24.637 --> 00:53:29.131
When Puen and I miss Up and Aou too much,

00:53:29.131 --> 00:53:31.357
I’d take Puen to the office

00:53:31.357 --> 00:53:34.917
to see this universe’s version of Up and Aou.

00:53:36.585 --> 00:53:40.439
Puen's life and mine have changed dramatically since then.

00:53:40.439 --> 00:53:43.455
Puen is leaning towards the work behind the camera.

00:53:43.455 --> 00:53:48.293
And he decided to set up a screenwriting studio called Friends Credits.

00:53:50.530 --> 00:53:55.951
Joobjang once told us we travel between universes to learn something.

00:53:56.425 --> 00:53:59.832
For me, I learned about love.

00:54:00.157 --> 00:54:02.413
I was someone who didn’t believe in love.

00:54:02.413 --> 00:54:05.901
I never even thought of having someone in life.

00:54:05.901 --> 00:54:08.231
But then universal traveling brought Puen to me.

00:54:08.231 --> 00:54:12.914
And he paints my life pink forever.

00:54:12.914 --> 00:54:14.753
I think we’re missing something.

00:54:16.128 --> 00:54:17.282
What?

00:54:18.037 --> 00:54:19.941
A pink trumpet tree.

00:54:20.707 --> 00:54:22.068
We aren’t.

00:54:26.853 --> 00:54:27.990
There.

00:54:28.481 --> 00:54:29.874
A pink trumpet tree.

00:54:30.544 --> 00:54:31.841
Damn.

00:54:32.287 --> 00:54:35.470
This is a 25-meter-tall pink trumpet tree.

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:41.507
What are you wishing for?

00:54:41.507 --> 00:54:42.440
Hey!

00:54:43.769 --> 00:54:44.842
Don’t be nosy.

00:54:50.361 --> 00:54:52.713
(I knew you’d read it!!)

00:54:56.083 --> 00:54:58.083
Well, well.

00:54:58.429 --> 00:54:59.949
Someone just fell for it.

00:55:01.031 --> 00:55:04.086
The real wish is here.

00:55:05.411 --> 00:55:06.344
Here.

00:55:07.239 --> 00:55:08.306
I’ll let you read it.

00:55:13.652 --> 00:55:16.355
Ever since I saw you singing in Pong’s bar,

00:55:16.801 --> 00:55:19.664
I’ve fallen head over heels in love with you.

00:55:23.204 --> 00:55:28.145
Do you want to know the wish I want to write down the most now?

00:55:28.752 --> 00:55:29.727
I do.

00:56:22.099 --> 00:56:23.300
Puen!

00:56:24.689 --> 00:56:26.146
What are you doing?

00:56:32.496 --> 00:56:35.999
Tonight, let’s go head over heels for each other!

00:56:37.450 --> 00:56:41.496
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

00:57:11.265 --> 00:57:12.849
This reminds me of that universe.

00:57:12.849 --> 00:57:15.720
Same-sex marriage in Thailand is already approved.

00:57:15.927 --> 00:57:19.813
It’s also allowed in many countries in this universe.

00:57:19.813 --> 00:57:20.996
Do you want to get married?

00:57:25.536 --> 00:57:26.731
Here.

00:57:27.701 --> 00:57:28.553
What?

00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:32.034
Roses for my boyfriend.

00:57:37.685 --> 00:57:40.005
Hey, where are you going boyfriend?

00:57:40.005 --> 00:57:41.053
Wait up.

00:57:44.688 --> 00:57:45.609
Hey.

00:57:46.504 --> 00:57:48.222
Eating all alone here.

00:57:58.819 --> 00:58:00.180
I miss that universe.

00:58:02.998 --> 00:58:07.097
Though both universes have many differences,

00:58:07.257 --> 00:58:08.785
there’s one thing we have just the same.

00:58:09.169 --> 00:58:10.033
What?

00:58:10.033 --> 00:58:11.412
These.

00:58:11.537 --> 00:58:13.921
Taste exactly the same as that.

00:58:13.921 --> 00:58:16.236
Snacks can’t entice me.

00:58:28.042 --> 00:58:31.609
The sunset here is just as beautiful as it is in the other universe.

00:58:33.671 --> 00:58:37.557
And we’re always together in both places.

00:58:42.872 --> 00:58:44.552
Can I have that flavor?

00:58:54.448 --> 00:58:56.320
Can I have this Lay too?

00:58:59.303 --> 00:59:00.664
Are you crazy?

00:59:40.327 --> 00:59:41.624
What are you doing?

00:59:41.942 --> 00:59:43.335
Asking you to marry me

00:59:45.187 --> 00:59:46.835
in our universe’s version.

00:59:49.605 --> 00:59:50.712
What are you saying?

00:59:50.872 --> 00:59:51.989
- It’s cheesy.
- Hey!

00:59:56.463 --> 00:59:57.951
Will you take it?

01:00:23.231 --> 01:00:25.097
So it’s a yes?

01:00:29.093 --> 01:00:30.206
Yes.

01:00:51.802 --> 01:00:53.578
Did Black live here alone?

01:00:54.201 --> 01:00:56.457
White, memorize this.

01:00:56.723 --> 01:00:58.499
This guy is Gram.

01:00:59.421 --> 01:01:00.386
This is Yok.

01:01:00.386 --> 01:01:01.677
And this is Sean.

01:01:02.641 --> 01:01:04.897
They’re very dangerous.

01:01:06.287 --> 01:01:08.287
You must look after yourself.

01:01:08.873 --> 01:01:11.385
Was Black really involved in the illegal business?

01:01:11.385 --> 01:01:13.385
If you’re scared, you have a chance to back off now.

01:01:13.808 --> 01:01:14.856
No.

01:01:15.048 --> 01:01:17.407
I must track down those who injured Black

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.940
and put them all behind bars.

01:01:29.578 --> 01:01:31.354
You’ve changed so much.

01:01:33.811 --> 01:01:34.820
Punch me.

01:01:40.711 --> 01:01:42.104
It’s good as it is.
