1
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:15,000
Where is Riam?

2
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:25,160
-Ram!
-I'm talking to you. Where is Riam?

3
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,079
Ram.

4
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:29,000
Spit it out!

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,159
Where is Riam?

6
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,240
All right, I'll tell you where she is.

7
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,520
ONE MONTH EARLIER

8
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:05,239
Toh, the Flying Shield.

9
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,239
Sorn, the Homicidal Hammer.

10
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,799
Mor, the Herb Doctor.

11
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,200
Riam, it's just training. Why so serious?

12
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,079
My eyes are bad,
and you're going to kill me!

13
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,719
You told me not to hold back.

14
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,079
But you don't have to squash us
like we're tadpoles.

15
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:04,079
-Hurry up. They'll be here soon.
-Yes, ma'am.

16
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,280
-Waew, are you done?
-I am.

17
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,400
Give it to me.

18
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,439
Your mung bean sweets look delicious.

19
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,280
They could look even better.

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,680
Don't be so modest.

21
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:30,319
Your sweets are well-known
from Bang Namkroi to Bang Kapi.

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,639
Thanks, Mom.

23
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:34,280
Well, where's my youngest daughter?

24
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,759
I bet she's at the temple
with Sorn and the gang.

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,840
Pumpkin!

26
00:02:39,919 --> 00:02:41,360
Yes, Mom.

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,319
Go get Riam.

28
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,599
Why me?

29
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:51,560
Because you're my boy. Go.

30
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,039
That was quick.

31
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,960
She's already on her way.

32
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,159
Oops.

33
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,719
Stop right here.

34
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,039
I told you not to hang out
with Sorn and his gang.

35
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:17,439
Why can't you be a lady like your sister?

36
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,400
Martial arts are not for girls.

37
00:03:19,479 --> 00:03:22,479
No guy will want to look at you!

38
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,400
Go clean up and put on your best clothes.

39
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,199
The chief and his son are coming.

40
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,319
Ram, Jam, let's check on the desserts.

41
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,800
-Yes, Mom.
-Go.

42
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:35,719
Quick.

43
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,080
-Come on, Auntie.
-Okay.

44
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:46,080
What are you standing there for?

45
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,919
Why should I put on my best clothes?

46
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,639
The chief's son won't even look at me.

47
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:54,199
He'll only have eyes for her.

48
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,479
So why don't you
make him look at you, huh?

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,960
Well…

50
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,000
your sweets are second to none.

51
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,400
Everything we serve you

52
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:17,519
was made by my daughter Ram.

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,240
Wow, she would make the finest housewife.

54
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:26,560
Listen,

55
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,639
my son, Kem,
has just finished school in the capital.

56
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:38,240
It would be nice if he could
get to know your daughters.

57
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:47,959
So that one day we may become
one big, happy family.

58
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:52,879
I heard you have two daughters, right?

59
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:58,079
Then my son
will have to choose one of them.

60
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:04,000
But where's your other girl?

61
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:58,680
Riam!

62
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,519
What the hell are you doing?

63
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:07,920
You told me to clean myself up.

64
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,439
Out here?

65
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:13,040
Do it in the back!

66
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,639
But I like it here.

67
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:19,040
No! Get out of here!

68
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
No need to yell at me, Mom.

69
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:27,920
I told you to get ready
to welcome Chief Aum.

70
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,720
Don't worry.

71
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,639
I have prepared a show for him.

72
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,720
Go.

73
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,000
We're ready.

74
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,160
Great. It's a circus.

75
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,000
Want a spittoon?

76
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:55,360
Just swallowed it.

77
00:06:55,439 --> 00:06:56,439
Whoa.

78
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,160
-Let's pay our respects first.
-Just a minute.

79
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,920
Who are these people?

80
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:06,639
The mustachioed one is Sorn,
an ex-soldier.

81
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,720
That guy is Toh, an ex-bandit.

82
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,920
The one with glasses is Mor.
He sells wild herbs.

83
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,319
What a motley crew.

84
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:21,839
An odd and crazy crew.
They live in a temple, or so I heard.

85
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,399
Good afternoon, lovely ladies
and dishonorable men.

86
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,240
Ladies and gentlemen!

87
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,040
We are proud to present
a modern Thai ensemble,

88
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,800
the likes of which
you've never experienced before.

89
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
Other bands offer only music,

90
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,279
but ours offers comedy as a bonus.

91
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:49,120
Overture, please.

92
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,199
Hold on.

93
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:59,720
Why don't you play the instruments?

94
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,439
This is fusion music.

95
00:08:01,519 --> 00:08:02,680
What is that?

96
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,040
A combination of opera,
a cappella and spirulina.

97
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,519
Isn't that seaweed?

98
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,519
Seaweed that evolves into a xylophone.

99
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,680
One more time.

100
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:24,680
Our ensemble has a long
and reputable history.

101
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,720
In the old days,
we were called the Kickapoo.

102
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:32,200
We traveled across the sea
to perform for Qin Shi.

103
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,320
Emperor Qin?

104
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:35,600
Only for his Terracotta Army.

105
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,039
But they couldn't hear you!

106
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,759
Our next song is "Horse Dance."

107
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:53,480
The Kickapoo sailed across
the Mediterranean

108
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:56,440
and performed before Queen Elizabeth.

109
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,799
Her Majesty was very pleased
and gave us lots of pounds.

110
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,240
-Pounds sterling?
-Pound cakes.

111
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,399
There's still some left. Wanna try?

112
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,639
Must be stale by now.

113
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,440
Next is "Hopping Hare."

114
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,960
The Kickapoo took a train to Japan.

115
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:25,639
The Shogun loved us so much,
he gave us a gesture.

116
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,279
-A thumbs-up?
-The middle finger.

117
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
-Damn!
-That means you sucked.

118
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,759
The first song sucked,
but later he gave us lots of fish.

119
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,240
-Sashimi?
-Fish bones, because we sucked.

120
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,679
They're still stuck in my teeth.

121
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,120
I get the picture.

122
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,480
Next is "The Burmese Axe Dance."

123
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,120
After Japan, we went to Bago in Burma

124
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
where we played before King Peter…

125
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:57,799
-It's King Prae.
-King Peter was one of his five siblings.

126
00:09:57,879 --> 00:09:59,960
A big family, I guess.

127
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:04,240
Then we crossed the ocean again
to Scandinavia.

128
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,240
Enough with the history.
I want to see you perform now.

129
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,159
You just saw it.
We've already done five songs.

130
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,120
You're done?

131
00:10:13,399 --> 00:10:17,679
Already? I must have gotten carried away
with your jokes.

132
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:18,919
You enjoyed it, right?

133
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:29,519
Well, your youngest girl
seems a bit silly.

134
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:34,639
I think you just blew your chance.

135
00:10:38,039 --> 00:10:42,000
Ram, can you play any instruments?

136
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,480
If you don't get him,
your sister shouldn't either.

137
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,799
My dear sister, please come here.

138
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,559
Go ahead.

139
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,480
Come here, please.

140
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,320
What do you want, Riam?

141
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:22,240
Ram will perform with us.

142
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,879
What are you doing?

143
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,039
You're a girl of many talents.
You can do this.

144
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,120
We'll perform this song
with no instruments.

145
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,000
It's called "Lao Duang Duen."

146
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,399
Ram will give us some music.

147
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,200
Ready?

148
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Oh, my beautiful moon…

149
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,120
Ram, what are you waiting for?

150
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:17,360
Beatboxing. You know what it is, right?
Let's try again.

151
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:29,039
Oh, my beautiful moon

152
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:37,559
I am serenading you, my love, my moon

153
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:45,440
It's late, I have to say good night

154
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:53,519
My heart aches for your moonlight

155
00:12:56,759 --> 00:13:03,080
Oh, my beautiful moon

156
00:13:03,159 --> 00:13:08,039
I am serenading you, my love, my moon

157
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:13,000
It's late, I have to say good night

158
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:20,000
My heart aches for your moonlight

159
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,120
Wow! Amazing!

160
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,679
Wow! Amazing!

161
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,480
What incredible skill!

162
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:41,279
So have you and your son decided?

163
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:49,639
My son prefers a soft and sweet girl.

164
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,600
Ram was supposed to be the one,

165
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,840
but we were taken aback
by her fierce beatboxing.

166
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,919
Oh, that was a prank
Riam was pulling to discredit her.

167
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,600
Really? Her dubstep was pretty intense.

168
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,559
Okay, then I'll go for…

169
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:15,799
Riam.

170
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,519
I mean Riam should stay away from my son.

171
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,080
And Ram will be my daughter-in-law.

172
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,759
What about your cousin here?

173
00:14:29,559 --> 00:14:33,360
You're a bright young man.
Don't you fancy my Riam?

174
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,879
I have an urgent meeting.
I'll see you another time.

175
00:14:46,159 --> 00:14:47,799
EVERLASTING HARD-ON - MOANING LADIES
THE GREAT BENGAL TIGER

176
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,320
Candy.

177
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,240
Yo!

178
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,559
-Do you like to suck?
-What?

179
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,919
-Wanna suck?
-Huh?

180
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:16,000
Lollipops?

181
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,440
No.

182
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:26,519
This song is fun. Can you dance?

183
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:31,279
I'm the best dancer in the mountains.

184
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,080
Why so sad? Let's dance.

185
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:34,720
Come on.

186
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,360
Dance, dance.

187
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,919
Let's dance together. Come on, dance.

188
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,720
Show me what you've got.

189
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,879
You won't dance or you can't dance?

190
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,919
Hey, that's an insult!

191
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,159
Challenge accepted.

192
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,120
Come on.

193
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,519
Hey, keep dancing.

194
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,279
Keep it coming. Keep dancing.

195
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,799
What moves! Marry me!

196
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,799
What was that?

197
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
You had a bizarre dream.

198
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,679
Who is he anyway?

199
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:38,000
I don't know.
I'm still upset about the chief.

200
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,799
Why does everyone like Ram?

201
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:42,879
Why is everyone obsessed with her?

202
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,319
Was that…

203
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,799
Sure is!

204
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,720
Well, Ram is the good girl.

205
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,720
And you're the bad girl.

206
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,640
Help!

207
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,000
So I'm a total loser.

208
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,119
Listen, I have plenty
of nice and handsome friends.

209
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,799
I've invited one here. He might like you.

210
00:17:39,599 --> 00:17:40,640
Forget it.

211
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,200
I give up.

212
00:17:43,279 --> 00:17:45,720
-Ram's being chased by a buffalo.
-What?

213
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,440
Help!

214
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,000
Help!

215
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,279
Stop!

216
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,759
Stop!

217
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,279
My legs hurt!

218
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,279
Help me!

219
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:15,480
Help!

220
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:16,960
Stop right there, you damn buffalo.

221
00:18:17,559 --> 00:18:19,480
I said stop!

222
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:23,000
This isn't a buffalo race!

223
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,000
Stop!

224
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:29,480
Stop!

225
00:18:32,599 --> 00:18:34,720
Help me, Riam!

226
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,119
Stop.

227
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,920
Stop.

228
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,319
Stop.

229
00:18:41,759 --> 00:18:42,599
Stop.

230
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,359
It's going even faster now!

231
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,599
Stop.

232
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,400
-Ram!
-What?

233
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,799
-Jump, quickly!
-Really?

234
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:56,839
Jump!

235
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,200
Sis, are you all right?

236
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:10,880
Oops.

237
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,039
I'm okay.

238
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:23,039
Thank you.
I'd be dead if it wasn't for you.

239
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,839
How about you? Are you hurt?

240
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,640
Let me see.

241
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,920
I'm fine. But you…

242
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,440
What? Do I not look okay?
What's the matter?

243
00:19:45,519 --> 00:19:48,920
Please let me keep him.

244
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
As a replacement for my dead buffalo.

245
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,119
No way.

246
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,240
He's a stray,

247
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:57,400
and he almost killed your sister.

248
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:02,119
I knew you could control that buffalo.

249
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,920
So you drove him after your sister, right?

250
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,960
I hate it when you read my mind.

251
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:12,359
He's a good boy.
Tui Tui has been tamed now.

252
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,880
So he has a name already.

253
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,079
He won't cause any trouble, I promise.

254
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,160
Right, Tui Tui?

255
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
-All right.
-Yeah!

256
00:20:29,079 --> 00:20:30,559
Stop it!

257
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,640
Bring the sweets to the abbot.

258
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,440
-No!
-Or you let the buffalo go.

259
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:37,720
Riam!

260
00:20:39,119 --> 00:20:42,480
All of you are lucky to be here.

261
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,720
This is a bullet-stopping amulet.

262
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,200
Oh my God!

263
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,839
Are you sure you don't want
to keep it, Toh?

264
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:51,880
Good things must be shared.

265
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,279
-I'll buy it now.
-Wait. Let me show you how it works.

266
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:57,599
-I'm all ears.
-Yeah.

267
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:01,839
Place it in your palm and recite a spell.

268
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,480
The amulet will rise,

269
00:21:04,359 --> 00:21:07,079
then speed out to stop the bullet.

270
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:09,960
Seeing is believing.

271
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,000
-Show us.
-Come on.

272
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,960
Magic!

273
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,279
It's moving!

274
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,920
Come on! Float!

275
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,039
Hold on.

276
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,039
-Stop!
-Why?

277
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,119
It's not floating.

278
00:21:31,279 --> 00:21:32,599
It's probably in sleep mode.

279
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,000
Charlatan! You're wasting my time.

280
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:40,160
-Let's go home.
-Don't leave. This is your last chance!

281
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,599
Bullshit.

282
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,279
Put that shit away, for God's sake.

283
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,880
But I did make it float before, I swear.

284
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,400
Why can't you do it now?

285
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,440
I'm wondering that myself.

286
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,240
Shit. We didn't make a dime today.

287
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:59,839
Let's eat. Riam made lunch for us.

288
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,640
Ram made these sweets.

289
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:08,079
And I made this.

290
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,359
What is it?

291
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,039
Sweets shaped like fruit are boring.

292
00:22:14,119 --> 00:22:16,359
So I came up with this buffalo design.

293
00:22:17,559 --> 00:22:22,200
Are you sure
I won't get diarrhea from this?

294
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:24,720
You're so mean.

295
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:28,880
Everything I do is wrong
because I'm not Ram.

296
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:34,880
Everyone is beautiful in their own way.

297
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,359
You have qualities
your sister may not have.

298
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:44,759
Someday, someone will appreciate
what you've got.

299
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,880
And when is that "someday," sir?

300
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,119
How would I know?

301
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:52,839
All right.

302
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:06,319
Ming, put these away.

303
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,680
Yes, sir.

304
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,799
Is this a bad omen?

305
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:02,480
May you two be blessed.

306
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:21,400
-Uncle Mor.
-Holy shit!

307
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,240
It's just me. Don't panic.

308
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,359
You scared me.

309
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:29,720
You have a lot of magic herbs, right?

310
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:31,680
Why?

311
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,400
You are the most precious thing
in my life.

312
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,119
If you really mean that,
don't ever leave me.

313
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:01,279
I'll never leave you,
until death do us part.

314
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,720
The horny herb? Seriously?

315
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:14,480
Yes. Uncle Mor said
it makes people insanely horny.

316
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,920
How did you get Ram to eat it?

317
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,039
I put it in her ginger drink.

318
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,559
Are you serious?

319
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,079
Kem prefers a gentle
and well-behaved lady, doesn't he?

320
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:37,279
What if Ram turns out to be
a sex-crazed bride?

321
00:25:37,359 --> 00:25:40,000
He'll leave her for sure.

322
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,440
Ram.

323
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,440
Ram.

324
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,160
Ram.

325
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,000
Kem will find it so off-putting.

326
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,079
Ram!

327
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,920
What's wrong with you?

328
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,440
Yeah, I like it rough.

329
00:26:38,519 --> 00:26:39,359
What?

330
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,240
I thought you liked prim and proper women.

331
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,720
That's what my dad said, not me.

332
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:49,720
How is this possible?

333
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,960
I don't get it.

334
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,359
Get your ass down now.

335
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,400
Are you messing with your sister again?

336
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,559
What's that?

337
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:29,920
Give it to me.

338
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:34,720
What is it?

339
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,759
Horny herb.

340
00:27:43,079 --> 00:27:45,559
I don't care how naughty you are,

341
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,920
but how could you do this to your sister?

342
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,839
She's always been nice to you.

343
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,480
She gives you her clothes
and things all the time.

344
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:58,720
You mean the clothes and things
she wanted to throw away?

345
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:02,400
Have you ever asked me
if I even wanted them?

346
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:07,000
Right, because I'm not worth
anything brand new.

347
00:28:07,079 --> 00:28:10,480
Only hand-me-downs to save your money.

348
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,759
I'm just a trash can.

349
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:16,119
You don't even need me in this house.

350
00:28:17,839 --> 00:28:21,279
You only need Ram. I could just drop dead.

351
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,440
Don't say that, Riam.

352
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,839
What should I say then, Mom?

353
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,359
How about, "Ram could drop dead
and I wouldn't care"?

354
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:15,400
Sir!

355
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,319
What is it, Abbot?

356
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,559
I had a vision.
The red-toothed bandits are coming.

357
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,359
Who are the red-toothed bandits?

358
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:31,359
They're evil outlaws
with knowledge of black magic.

359
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,240
He's definitely dead.

360
00:29:45,319 --> 00:29:46,720
What they want

361
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,920
isn't just money.

362
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:55,240
They want to deflower seven virgin girls

363
00:29:55,319 --> 00:30:00,319
who were born on the fifth Saturday
of a leap year.

364
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,640
This ritual
will make their leader immortal.

365
00:30:04,839 --> 00:30:08,519
Our village has a virgin girl
born on the fifth Saturday?

366
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:12,400
Just one more girl and you'll be immortal.

367
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,799
Where will we find this last girl?

368
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,079
She's in Bang Namkroi.

369
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:19,240
Who is it?

370
00:30:23,319 --> 00:30:24,519
It's Riam.

371
00:30:58,119 --> 00:30:59,200
Tui Tui,

372
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,359
do you think there's someone
out there who really loves me?

373
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,680
Great. Fart on me when I'm sad.

374
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,359
Disgusting.

375
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,039
Did you hear that?

376
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,359
Help! The red-toothed bandits are here!

377
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:44,279
Quiet! Or I'll kill you all!

378
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:46,839
They're here? Let's go!

379
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:58,440
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

380
00:31:58,519 --> 00:31:59,359
Yes.

381
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:01,920
And that is?

382
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,440
Run.

383
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,880
I lost my pride a long time ago.

384
00:32:06,599 --> 00:32:07,759
Then what are we waiting for?

385
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,400
-Let's go.
-Quick.

386
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,079
Stop right there.

387
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,119
How can you do this?

388
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,599
Do what?

389
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,799
Run away without me.

390
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,880
I said shut the hell up!

391
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,200
Shit. They're here.

392
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,240
Look.

393
00:32:48,279 --> 00:32:50,400
What's going on, Riam?

394
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,039
I don't know.

395
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,319
Go.

396
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,359
Shut up!

397
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,240
We gotta run! The bandits are here!

398
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,359
What? What do we do?

399
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,559
Where's Riam?

400
00:33:20,319 --> 00:33:24,200
Go find her. Check that room.

401
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,440
Where is Riam? I asked where Riam is.

402
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:28,759
Up here.

403
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,319
Run, Riam!

404
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,599
They're looking for you!

405
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,720
What?

406
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:39,599
Who are you?

407
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,240
I'm Ram.

408
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:42,799
This is my husband.

409
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,240
Where is Riam?

410
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:47,319
She's not home.

411
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,759
Don't lie to me.

412
00:33:48,839 --> 00:33:50,400
I said run, now!

413
00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:54,559
What are you doing here?

414
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:58,000
Let me go!

415
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,079
Tell me where she is!

416
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,239
Where did he go?

417
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,239
Out the window.

418
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,679
Kem!

419
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,079
Kem!

420
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,320
-Kem, you asshole.
-Come here.

421
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:21,559
Go.

422
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,760
Let me go.

423
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,400
Ram.

424
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,920
Get up.

425
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:30,840
Mom!

426
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,880
Mom!

427
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:38,679
She's Ram. Riam's sister.

428
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,239
I've asked her about Riam.

429
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,679
She said she didn't know where Riam was.

430
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:48,000
You don't know or you won't tell us?

431
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,840
Where is Riam?

432
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,880
I'm asking you where she is!

433
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,519
All right. I'll tell you.

434
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:25,840
Riam has gone to Bangkok. She's not here.

435
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:35,000
Don't you lie to me.

436
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:39,400
Enough!

437
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,320
You can kill us,
but we'll never tell you where she is!

438
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:48,039
Fine. I'll take you as hostages.

439
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,039
And you, go and tell Riam.

440
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,559
If she doesn't show up at Prakarn Mountain
before the first rain arrives…

441
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,280
I'll kill them all!

442
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,440
Take them.

443
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,840
Get up!

444
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,199
Move.

445
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,599
-Move!
-No!

446
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,079
The police said they couldn't spare
any men to help us.

447
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:52,280
They're asking for
reinforcements from Bangkok.

448
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,719
But it will take a long while
before they arrive.

449
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:59,559
We can't wait.

450
00:36:59,639 --> 00:37:03,320
They'll kill Jan and Ram before that.

451
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:04,920
Right.

452
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,639
Pumpkin, I have to save my mom.

453
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,119
Riam.

454
00:37:45,719 --> 00:37:47,400
Pumpkin and I will go
and rescue our family.

455
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,599
Are you crazy?
That's exactly what they want.

456
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,760
They just want me, not anybody else.

457
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,880
If I go, I may find a way
to help my mom and sister.

458
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,320
I can't just sit around and let them die.

459
00:38:04,559 --> 00:38:06,480
Does anybody want to come with us?

460
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,599
Okay. We'll leave tomorrow, then.

461
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:31,760
I've consulted the Third Eye
to assess the bandit chief's power.

462
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:35,559
His dark magic is powerful,

463
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:39,239
but he has his weaknesses.

464
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,360
Riam, you're a virgin

465
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:49,159
born on the fifth Saturday of a leap year.

466
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:52,400
Your spiritual force is great.

467
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,559
That's why he wants you for the ritual.

468
00:38:55,639 --> 00:38:58,000
But ironically, that's also why

469
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,079
you're the only one who can beat him.

470
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:12,800
This sacred tiger dagger,
as well as your spiritual power,

471
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,760
will help you defeat him.

472
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:19,360
Thank you, Abbot.

473
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,039
This tiger amulet
can ward off evil spirits.

474
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,079
Bye for now, Tui Tui.

475
00:39:34,159 --> 00:39:37,159
I'll try to come back alive.

476
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,039
I saw a moon halo last night.

477
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,840
That means rain will start to fall
in three days.

478
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,320
We won't make it in time
on the regular road.

479
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,320
We have to take a shortcut
through the forest, but…

480
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,320
But what?

481
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,559
But that shortcut…

482
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:02,039
People call it the Death Route.

483
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:04,519
Even bandits avoid it.

484
00:40:05,559 --> 00:40:08,239
We probably won't make it out alive.

485
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:13,199
Dead or alive, I'm going in anyway.

486
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,840
Hurry up!

487
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:29,920
Are we that heartless?

488
00:40:32,559 --> 00:40:35,679
Riam has always been kind to us.

489
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,639
Now she's in trouble,

490
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,559
and we won't lift a finger?

491
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,480
I'm going to help her.

492
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,000
Damn it! I have decided.

493
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:54,280
Better to die with glory
than to live with shame.

494
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:55,760
Let's go help Riam.

495
00:40:56,519 --> 00:40:58,519
All right, then.

496
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:01,679
Let's all die together.

497
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,079
I'm coming too.

498
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,599
Bless you.

499
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:26,119
I'm glad that you're going to help Riam.

500
00:41:26,199 --> 00:41:29,599
I will help her too.

501
00:41:30,199 --> 00:41:31,039
How, sir?

502
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:36,719
There are only two
of these sacred objects left.

503
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,920
What are they?

504
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,079
Blessed tiger's balls.

505
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:45,280
I'm not sure
if the sacred tiger dagger alone

506
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:49,800
will be able to deter those bandits.

507
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,920
So I charged these balls
with my mental force.

508
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,880
Remember, the moment
Riam stabs the bandit chief,

509
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:08,039
you must set these balls on fire.

510
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:09,760
The power contained inside

511
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:15,719
will be released
and will strengthen her dagger.

512
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,079
Can they really catch on fire?

513
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,639
Definitely.

514
00:42:18,719 --> 00:42:19,599
How do you know?

515
00:42:19,679 --> 00:42:20,599
Look.

516
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:24,159
-You moron!
-What?

517
00:42:24,239 --> 00:42:28,000
I just said I had only two left.

518
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:38,800
-Inn!
-Yes, boss.

519
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,920
Lock them in the house.

520
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,639
Aunt Jam,

521
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,079
if we die,

522
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,039
do you think Riam will get away from them?

523
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:13,920
I don't think so.

524
00:43:18,159 --> 00:43:20,239
Riam won't even think about running away.

525
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:24,599
I believe she's on her way here.

526
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:25,800
What?

527
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,480
What are these red marks?

528
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:38,760
They indicate the dangerous passages
in the woods.

529
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,599
If we can get past them,
we'll get to our mother.

530
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,840
The first passage is in a dense forest.

531
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,960
The Grove of Bullet Brambles.

532
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:01,079
Riam won't give up easily.

533
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:07,639
She's a jealous girl
who's never felt loved.

534
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,760
When she knows someone loves her,

535
00:44:14,039 --> 00:44:17,199
she'll do anything for that person.

536
00:44:18,679 --> 00:44:21,960
You probably wouldn't understand.

537
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:25,039
Because you've always been loved.

538
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:31,159
You're the good girl to your mom
and to everyone else.

539
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,920
But I never wanted to be the good girl.

540
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:39,079
I just wanted to be a good sister to Riam.

541
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:42,079
And a good daughter to my mom.

542
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:46,920
Maybe it's all of us

543
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:51,639
who made Riam the jealous type.

544
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:02,559
-Riam!
-What?

545
00:45:02,639 --> 00:45:04,199
You almost stepped on it.

546
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,400
These brambles
can pierce through your shoes.

547
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:10,360
The poison is deadly.

548
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,519
You wouldn't last a minute before dying.

549
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,719
Do you think this Riam will come to us?

550
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,000
It doesn't matter.

551
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:29,840
What matters is whether
she's really a virgin.

552
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:33,800
If not, it'll be a disaster.

553
00:45:34,679 --> 00:45:35,559
Why?

554
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:41,840
The fire element in Tai's body
would explode and kill him.

555
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,559
Mom, I have a plan.

556
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:51,079
What's your plan?

557
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,119
Be careful, Riam.

558
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:57,639
Pumpkin.

559
00:45:57,719 --> 00:45:59,599
Watch out, Riam.

560
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,440
Your legs!

561
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,840
It's narrow here.

562
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,320
Inn, go get more booze.

563
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,360
Right away.

564
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:34,320
Mom, give me the horny herb.

565
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,920
Are you sure?

566
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,320
Trust me.

567
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,960
The horny herb.

568
00:47:13,880 --> 00:47:15,239
Mom, Auntie.

569
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:34,800
No more dried beef left?

570
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,719
Downstairs. Come with me.

571
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,599
Look at my legs.

572
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:05,679
They're all scratched.

573
00:49:06,719 --> 00:49:09,519
No! Get away from me!

574
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:11,039
Mom! Help!

575
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:13,039
Mom!

576
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:14,719
No!

577
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:16,679
Help!

578
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:17,880
Get away from me!

579
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,000
Mom!

580
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:21,679
No!

581
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:25,719
Hey, stop it.

582
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:29,199
Tai!

583
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,480
Control yourself.
You'll get yourself killed!

584
00:49:37,039 --> 00:49:38,840
What did you do to him?

585
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,079
You drugged me?

586
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,440
Did you drug me?

587
00:50:02,159 --> 00:50:04,039
Riam, slow down.

588
00:50:04,119 --> 00:50:05,159
What now?

589
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:10,679
We're approaching
the second dangerous spot.

590
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,159
-Are we?
-Yes.

591
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:18,199
Tie them up downstairs.

592
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,960
Do you hear that?

593
00:50:33,039 --> 00:50:34,639
Yes. What is it?

594
00:50:54,239 --> 00:50:56,719
The second danger is in a sparse forest.

595
00:50:57,559 --> 00:50:59,119
The Fire Cobra's Ground.

596
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:06,840
Riam!

597
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:07,840
What?

598
00:51:08,360 --> 00:51:10,119
A Fire Cobra is right behind you.

599
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,400
Come. It's this way.

600
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,000
-Don't walk too fast.
-You walk too slow.

601
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:18,760
Because I can't see well.

602
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,840
We have to hurry.

603
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,400
What's wrong? What?

604
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,239
I stepped on something.
It hurts really bad.

605
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,199
Is that…

606
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:33,599
-What is it, Mor?
-Shit!

607
00:51:34,239 --> 00:51:36,039
These are the Bullet Brambles.

608
00:51:36,119 --> 00:51:41,039
Their poison will enter your legs
and spread through your body.

609
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,440
It will reach your brain
and ultimately kill you.

610
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:45,400
You're screwed.

611
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,679
I don't want to die. Help me!

612
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:53,559
-Cut off his leg. Give me the knife.
-Cut it right off.

613
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:54,639
The knife is ready.

614
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:58,880
Wait! Can't you try other options first?

615
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:00,719
Other options?

616
00:52:01,559 --> 00:52:02,480
Let me think.

617
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,800
Thinking takes too long.
Let's cut off your leg.

618
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:13,880
No! There must be another way.

619
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,679
Give him some time.

620
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:23,280
I've got it! I have this brown herb.

621
00:52:23,360 --> 00:52:26,000
Grind it, and its powder
can neutralize the poison.

622
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:28,519
What the hell are you waiting for?

623
00:52:28,599 --> 00:52:30,320
I'm in pain.

624
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,800
Shit!

625
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,119
Tell me. What now?

626
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:39,360
The Cobra has brought friends.

627
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,840
How many?

628
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:42,800
Three.

629
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:44,559
Three snakes?

630
00:52:44,639 --> 00:52:45,559
Three-zero. Thirty.

631
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:07,079
Mor, you're taking forever!

632
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:10,079
Look, the poison has spread to his lips.

633
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,760
It's too late.

634
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,800
-I'm cutting off his leg.
-Hold on!

635
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:17,960
Mor.

636
00:53:18,039 --> 00:53:19,840
-What?
-Hurry up.

637
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,440
I know. I'm trying!

638
00:53:21,519 --> 00:53:23,280
It's so painful!

639
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,760
The leaves are so thick.

640
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,360
Let me do it.

641
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:34,119
Why is this herb so thick?

642
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,599
Holy shit.

643
00:53:40,039 --> 00:53:41,440
It's the wrong herb.

644
00:53:44,559 --> 00:53:45,880
What the hell am I chewing?

645
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:48,039
I was looking for an antidote,

646
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:49,800
but I gave you a poisonous leaf.

647
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:53,480
The toxin will make your veins burst

648
00:53:54,239 --> 00:53:55,119
and paralyze you.

649
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,639
Damn, that sounds worse than my leg!

650
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:01,599
Run!

651
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,239
Run!

652
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,440
Faster, Pumpkin!

653
00:54:17,639 --> 00:54:20,039
What do we do now?

654
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:40,559
Volcanic sulfur.

655
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,440
We're safe now.

656
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:14,800
-Shit!
-What the hell is this?

657
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:17,360
It's volcanic sulfur.

658
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,880
You've had it on you this whole time?

659
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:20,920
Yeah, Uncle Mor gave it to me.

660
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:24,679
So what were you waiting for back there?

661
00:55:25,519 --> 00:55:26,519
I forgot I had it.

662
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:28,920
You made a mess.

663
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:32,440
There's a rash all over your face.

664
00:55:33,559 --> 00:55:36,599
Your nervous system is collapsing.
You'll go numb soon.

665
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:38,239
Sorn…

666
00:55:40,519 --> 00:55:42,639
do you feel any pain?

667
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:44,320
Yes, from the first slap.

668
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:46,400
But why am I so cold?

669
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,159
The poison's entered your veins.

670
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:53,079
You'll get colder and colder.

671
00:55:53,159 --> 00:55:54,840
The fire element is exploding inside you.

672
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,800
I'm cold. Let me hug you.

673
00:55:57,880 --> 00:55:59,679
I'll keep you warm.

674
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:04,679
Let me cut off your leg first!

675
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:07,159
No, it's so cold!

676
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,639
I'll hug you, Sorn.

677
00:56:10,719 --> 00:56:12,519
Let's cut off your lips first.

678
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:14,960
Damn, I'm cold.

679
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,559
Am I in Alaska or what?

680
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,360
-Mor.
-Yes?

681
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,280
Just do something. Use your head.

682
00:56:24,639 --> 00:56:26,079
I'm dying.

683
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,159
I've got it.

684
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,800
-What do we do?
-Just eat the brown herb.

685
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:34,320
Don't bother with the grinding.

686
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,079
Asshole! Why didn't you say
that in the first place?

687
00:56:38,159 --> 00:56:39,000
You're right.

688
00:56:39,079 --> 00:56:41,199
Do it quick!

689
00:56:44,039 --> 00:56:44,880
Easy!

690
00:56:47,159 --> 00:56:50,880
Easy. Like feeding a duck.

691
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,719
Chew it and swallow.

692
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,800
That was close.

693
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:02,119
Damn you, Mor.

694
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,239
What kind of herb doctor are you?

695
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,320
Yeah, you're welcome.

696
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,039
Where am I?

697
00:57:20,800 --> 00:57:22,559
Where's Pumpkin?

698
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:38,400
Slide into my arms.

699
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:41,880
I'll keep you safe.

700
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:48,599
It's him again.

701
00:57:51,239 --> 00:57:54,280
What did you say?

702
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,440
Wait.

703
00:57:58,840 --> 00:58:01,880
Swallow something first.

704
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,519
Swallow what?

705
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:05,719
Tea.

706
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,519
Pulled tea.

707
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:10,400
Are you serious?

708
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,280
Taste it and you'll never forget it.

709
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:17,239
Yummy!

710
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:23,079
Watch.

711
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,440
Over the head.

712
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:41,960
Done. Ready to drink.

713
00:58:42,039 --> 00:58:43,960
You're wasting my time.

714
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:49,159
Open your mouth. It's coming.

715
00:58:50,159 --> 00:58:51,639
So tasty!

716
00:58:51,719 --> 00:58:52,599
Riam!

717
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,679
What's wrong with you?

718
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:56,400
I was dreaming.

719
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,199
-About what?
-That guy.

720
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:01,559
I don't get it.

721
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:05,239
Why do I keep seeing
this guy in my dreams?

722
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:08,480
We're in deep shit,
and you're dreaming about a guy?

723
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:11,440
I can't believe it.

724
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:14,199
What is it?

725
00:59:16,679 --> 00:59:18,000
What is it?

726
00:59:18,519 --> 00:59:19,360
Riam.

727
00:59:31,559 --> 00:59:32,599
Uncle!

728
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,199
Uncle!

729
00:59:35,719 --> 00:59:36,960
Uncle Sorn!

730
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:38,960
Uncle!

731
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:40,960
Good thing I'm a fast catcher.

732
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:44,400
That's not funny, damn it!

733
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:48,079
You guys are here to help me?

734
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,000
We sure are.

735
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:07,039
Inn, get them over here.

736
01:00:09,159 --> 01:00:12,000
It's going to rain.

737
01:00:12,519 --> 01:00:17,480
Soon it will rain on Prakarn Mountain.

738
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,800
When the first rain falls,

739
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:23,039
they're going to kill our family.

740
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:24,639
We're doomed.

741
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,320
When it starts raining, shoot them.

742
01:00:35,639 --> 01:00:37,079
Sure, boss.

743
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,119
The lemongrass ritual.

744
01:00:43,199 --> 01:00:44,639
What are you talking about?

745
01:00:44,719 --> 01:00:48,320
A virgin can stop the rain by sticking
lemongrass upside-down into the ground.

746
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:49,880
That's what I'll do.

747
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:53,199
But where are we going to find lemongrass?

748
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,679
I have some!

749
01:00:59,039 --> 01:01:00,519
-Thank you so much, Uncle Mor.
-Yes.

750
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,400
How come it didn't work?

751
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,800
Why didn't it work, Riam?

752
01:01:32,719 --> 01:01:34,840
You've had sex, haven't you?

753
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:37,000
No! Never!

754
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:39,639
Then how come it's pouring rain?

755
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:42,800
I've never done it.
I would know, wouldn't I?

756
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:44,280
Are you a heavy sleeper?

757
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,800
I said I'm a virgin!

758
01:01:47,920 --> 01:01:50,239
Then why isn't it working?

759
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,320
Shit!

760
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:55,480
This isn't lemongrass. It's green onion!

761
01:01:58,360 --> 01:01:59,960
I got it wrong again.

762
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:03,880
Get her some lemongrass.

763
01:02:05,159 --> 01:02:06,079
Now!

764
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:15,559
Who wants to go first?

765
01:02:18,719 --> 01:02:19,559
How about you?

766
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,559
Don't shoot my mother!

767
01:02:22,639 --> 01:02:24,440
You love your mom that much, huh?

768
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,239
Riam!

769
01:02:59,039 --> 01:02:59,880
Stop!

770
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:06,079
Take them away.

771
01:03:07,239 --> 01:03:09,039
Get up!

772
01:03:11,199 --> 01:03:13,440
Get back there.

773
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,840
I think Tui Tui has run away.

774
01:03:29,280 --> 01:03:32,599
Riam asked me to look after him,
and I let her down.

775
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:37,159
He didn't run away.

776
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:42,960
He's a loyal beast,
and he's gone to help his mistress.

777
01:03:43,679 --> 01:03:45,360
What? He's gone to help Riam?

778
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,400
How will he find her?

779
01:03:51,360 --> 01:03:52,519
That, I don't know.

780
01:03:57,639 --> 01:03:59,559
It's been a rough journey,

781
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:02,559
and we're not even close to the bandits.

782
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:06,199
Will we have any strength left
to fight them?

783
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,559
What's wrong with you, Riam?

784
01:04:14,719 --> 01:04:16,440
This is no time to dance.

785
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:23,119
I'm not Riam. I'm the mighty goddess.

786
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,480
That bitch insulted me
by stepping on my shrine.

787
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:35,519
All of you too!

788
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:40,000
Chill, goddess.

789
01:04:41,239 --> 01:04:43,199
Uncle Sorn, run!

790
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,400
Okay, I'll run!

791
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,920
Don't you dare run away from me!

792
01:04:48,679 --> 01:04:50,800
Please don't hurt us.

793
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,920
I will kill you all.

794
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:56,599
I didn't mean to insult you. I'm sorry.

795
01:04:56,679 --> 01:04:59,280
I don't care. I'm angry!

796
01:05:00,519 --> 01:05:02,000
What the hell's happening here?

797
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:03,719
-Easy.
-It's me, Riam.

798
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:05,639
Pull yourself together, Riam.

799
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:07,159
I'm the goddess!

800
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:09,239
Make up your mind, bitch!

801
01:05:09,960 --> 01:05:11,920
Did you just call me a bitch, asshole?

802
01:05:14,719 --> 01:05:17,760
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to slap you.

803
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:19,679
I know it wasn't you.

804
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:21,960
-You know nothing, asshole.
-There you go again.

805
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:26,079
Why did you call him an asshole?

806
01:05:26,159 --> 01:05:27,880
You dare call me an asshole?

807
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:30,519
Who are you?
You can't call someone an asshole, okay?

808
01:05:30,599 --> 01:05:32,400
I'm the monkey goddess.

809
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,559
Why should we be afraid of you?

810
01:05:35,679 --> 01:05:38,719
You're just a puny little goddess.

811
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:41,239
You'll shit yourself
when you find out who he is.

812
01:05:41,320 --> 01:05:42,239
I don't care who he is.

813
01:05:42,320 --> 01:05:44,800
He's Sorn, the Homicidal Hammer.

814
01:05:48,159 --> 01:05:49,480
That hurts!

815
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:52,079
You could kick him in the face,
and he'd be fine.

816
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,440
Shut up. Don't egg her on!

817
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:00,320
What are you doing?

818
01:06:00,400 --> 01:06:01,920
Stop hurting him.

819
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,239
I won't!

820
01:06:03,320 --> 01:06:06,280
That's enough.

821
01:06:06,360 --> 01:06:09,079
No, it's not enough.

822
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:11,559
I'm begging you.

823
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:18,480
Don't just stand there. Give me a hand!

824
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:22,079
Pumpkin, you coward, do something useful!

825
01:06:22,159 --> 01:06:24,320
-What do you want me to do?
-Whatever. Just do it.

826
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,639
Right, I have this amulet.

827
01:06:27,719 --> 01:06:28,800
Put it on her.

828
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,719
-Riam.
-It worked.

829
01:06:42,960 --> 01:06:45,119
Has the spirit left her?

830
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,280
I'm so tired.

831
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,760
That was real, wasn't it?

832
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,440
What happened to me?

833
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:58,000
More like, what happened to me?

834
01:07:01,199 --> 01:07:05,840
Look, the river has deep
and shallow channels under the surface.

835
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,840
The bandits rest their horses
on the other side of the river.

836
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:14,119
What are we waiting for, then?

837
01:07:14,199 --> 01:07:15,119
Hold on.

838
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,519
The third danger lies in the river.

839
01:07:20,920 --> 01:07:23,079
A primordial crocodile
lives in its depths.

840
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,480
I've heard this story before.

841
01:07:27,559 --> 01:07:33,119
But nobody has seen it for a long time.
Maybe it's already dead.

842
01:07:36,679 --> 01:07:37,840
Be careful.

843
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,159
Hurry up!

844
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:56,960
Go!

845
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:08,639
Be careful, Riam. Come, Riam.

846
01:08:09,239 --> 01:08:10,599
-Riam!
-Where is she?

847
01:08:10,679 --> 01:08:11,519
Riam!

848
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,800
Maybe she got sucked
into the deep channel.

849
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:15,960
Riam!

850
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,239
Riam!

851
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:51,560
You're a good swimmer. Get down there.

852
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:52,479
In your dreams.

853
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,399
Riam!

854
01:09:03,199 --> 01:09:04,199
Riam!

855
01:09:11,800 --> 01:09:13,399
What do we do?

856
01:09:14,239 --> 01:09:15,640
We have to do something!

857
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:24,079
The dagger.

858
01:10:14,279 --> 01:10:17,079
Riam!

859
01:10:20,760 --> 01:10:21,680
Come on up.

860
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,640
Are you hurt?

861
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,159
Get up here, Uncle Mor.

862
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:39,199
It's coming.

863
01:10:39,279 --> 01:10:40,880
-Come on, Sorn!
-Coming.

864
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:41,880
Hurry up!

865
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,319
I'm dead.

866
01:10:57,239 --> 01:10:58,479
Hang in there.

867
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:03,159
-Riam!
-What?

868
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:07,079
Stupid girl, stop!
You keep hitting my butt!

869
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,600
Tui Tui!

870
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:14,640
Riam!

871
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:20,439
Go, Tui Tui!

872
01:11:24,439 --> 01:11:26,000
Sorn, get out of the way!

873
01:11:29,079 --> 01:11:30,039
Quick!

874
01:11:32,439 --> 01:11:33,520
Leave me alone.

875
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:34,840
Go!

876
01:11:37,359 --> 01:11:39,279
Get away from me.

877
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:46,840
Riam!

878
01:11:50,319 --> 01:11:51,159
Tui Tui.

879
01:11:51,239 --> 01:11:54,000
That crocodile is so powerful!

880
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,600
Tui Tui!

881
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:04,319
Riam, catch!

882
01:12:08,680 --> 01:12:10,920
Shoot!

883
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,279
Tui Tui!

884
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:33,239
It's not just the crocodile.

885
01:12:33,319 --> 01:12:34,960
The buffalo's powerful too.

886
01:12:36,279 --> 01:12:38,800
Tui Tui, are you hurt?

887
01:12:41,079 --> 01:12:43,119
He got one.

888
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:46,840
I got three and my ass
looks like a pin cushion.

889
01:12:49,439 --> 01:12:56,439
Riam, tell Tui Tui to go home.
He's hurt real bad.

890
01:12:56,520 --> 01:12:58,680
And what about me?

891
01:12:59,319 --> 01:13:00,880
On the count of three, okay?

892
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:02,680
-On three?
-Yeah.

893
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:03,600
One!

894
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:09,119
Freaking idiot! What about two and three?

895
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:10,680
It's less painful this way.

896
01:13:12,039 --> 01:13:14,239
-Two more.
-Two more, right?

897
01:13:14,319 --> 01:13:15,399
On three again, okay?

898
01:13:15,479 --> 01:13:17,239
Three!

899
01:13:17,319 --> 01:13:21,039
You bastard! Where were one and two?

900
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:22,279
It would take too long.

901
01:13:22,359 --> 01:13:23,560
One more to go?

902
01:13:24,119 --> 01:13:26,359
All done. But… Shit!

903
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:31,359
One arrowhead's still stuck in your ass.

904
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,359
Now what?

905
01:13:34,439 --> 01:13:35,680
What are you looking for?

906
01:13:36,199 --> 01:13:37,239
A knife.

907
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:39,199
No, I'll push it out myself.

908
01:13:39,279 --> 01:13:41,000
Right on.

909
01:13:44,079 --> 01:13:45,399
Is it out yet?

910
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:49,760
There's blood squirting out of you!

911
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:54,960
Try to stop it, or you'll bleed to death.

912
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:58,159
-Ready?
-You're asking me?

913
01:13:58,239 --> 01:13:59,239
No, myself.

914
01:14:03,760 --> 01:14:06,720
Stop it, or you'll bleed to death.

915
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:09,640
Easy now.

916
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:17,560
Done.

917
01:14:26,279 --> 01:14:28,319
No one's going to rescue us.

918
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,479
We'd better prepare for the worst.

919
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,960
Don't give up hope, Mom.

920
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,359
Maybe Riam and her friends
are on their way.

921
01:14:44,039 --> 01:14:47,079
Riam? I'd never expect anything from her.

922
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:53,159
That's typical of you.
It's why Riam turned out the way she did.

923
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:55,439
What are you talking about?

924
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:06,600
To you, a good daughter
must be prim and proper.

925
01:15:07,399 --> 01:15:09,840
A real lady.

926
01:15:11,279 --> 01:15:12,479
But Riam is different.

927
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:16,640
So to you, she's a good-for-nothing.

928
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:26,600
Do you really think

929
01:15:27,640 --> 01:15:29,520
Riam has no redeeming qualities at all?

930
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:09,840
So?

931
01:16:11,800 --> 01:16:13,079
They're still alive.

932
01:16:13,680 --> 01:16:15,319
Uncle Toh, you take out Cherd.

933
01:16:16,680 --> 01:16:19,199
Uncle Sorn, you get rid of Inn.

934
01:16:20,439 --> 01:16:24,560
Uncle Mor and Pumpkin,
get ready to light the tiger's ball.

935
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,439
Do it exactly when
I'm taking out their boss.

936
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:30,399
Okay.

937
01:16:30,479 --> 01:16:31,680
Let's do it.

938
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:33,319
Wait.

939
01:16:33,960 --> 01:16:35,720
You can't go like this.

940
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:38,640
You need some kind of camouflage.

941
01:16:39,560 --> 01:16:41,560
You're right. Thanks for the advice.

942
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:42,520
You're welcome.

943
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:51,479
I'm ready.

944
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:52,920
Holy shit!

945
01:16:54,199 --> 01:16:56,600
What are you doing?

946
01:16:56,680 --> 01:16:58,520
You told me I needed camouflage.

947
01:16:58,600 --> 01:17:02,920
Yes, but you look ridiculous like that.

948
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:06,279
No one can spot me this way.

949
01:17:06,359 --> 01:17:08,359
They'll spot you from miles away.

950
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:19,720
Cherd.

951
01:17:33,199 --> 01:17:34,800
Looking for your horse?

952
01:17:36,439 --> 01:17:37,760
I set him free.

953
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:56,439
Ram.

954
01:17:58,159 --> 01:17:59,079
Ram.

955
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,680
Buddha help me!

956
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:09,439
Who is that?

957
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,600
It's me, Riam.

958
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:12,800
Riam?

959
01:18:12,880 --> 01:18:15,800
I'm wearing a disguise.

960
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:23,920
Riam!

961
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,199
I've come to rescue you.

962
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:31,720
Help me too.

963
01:18:33,960 --> 01:18:35,279
Are you all right?

964
01:18:38,560 --> 01:18:40,000
Get up, Mom.

965
01:18:43,159 --> 01:18:45,760
Be quiet. You three get out of here now.

966
01:18:46,359 --> 01:18:49,359
Wait. Where are you going?

967
01:18:50,079 --> 01:18:52,159
I'm going to take care of the boss.

968
01:18:52,680 --> 01:18:56,199
No. You can't beat him.

969
01:18:56,279 --> 01:18:59,560
I have to try, or this will never end.

970
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:01,720
Go now. Go.

971
01:19:03,199 --> 01:19:04,119
Shit!

972
01:19:06,479 --> 01:19:10,479
Look after yourself. I care about you.

973
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:13,039
It's okay.

974
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,800
Only one of us
will walk out of here alive.

975
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:30,560
Well, I have something special
to try out on you.

976
01:19:31,399 --> 01:19:32,600
What's that?

977
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:34,720
The invisible tiger's fang.

978
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:38,920
Put it in your mouth and blow.

979
01:19:39,439 --> 01:19:42,319
Your enemy won't be able to see you.

980
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:07,520
The invisible fang is working.

981
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:32,840
You can't lift my hammer.

982
01:20:33,479 --> 01:20:36,239
Unless you were born on the twelfth day

983
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:38,920
in the fourth month
in the Year of the Tiger.

984
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:46,319
Damn it. That's your birthday too?

985
01:20:46,399 --> 01:20:47,279
Yup.

986
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:53,840
Wait.

987
01:20:56,880 --> 01:20:59,359
The invulnerable tiger's fang.

988
01:20:59,439 --> 01:21:05,840
Put it in your mouth,
and no one can harm you.

989
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:07,199
-Amen.
-Awesome.

990
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:23,800
That's a backhand.

991
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,920
And now a forehand.

992
01:21:28,279 --> 01:21:29,359
A headbutt.

993
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:32,239
This is called backhead.

994
01:21:32,319 --> 01:21:33,359
Got it?

995
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:39,680
Get ready to die!

996
01:21:48,720 --> 01:21:49,720
Hold on.

997
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:51,800
You can see me?

998
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:53,680
Oh my!

999
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:55,640
What's the problem?

1000
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:58,159
I forgot to tell Sorn and Toh

1001
01:21:58,239 --> 01:22:01,399
that the magic of the tiger's fang
only lasts for three minutes.

1002
01:22:03,479 --> 01:22:04,520
I feel a little pain.

1003
01:22:06,399 --> 01:22:07,359
Maybe not.

1004
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,560
Definitely.

1005
01:22:15,560 --> 01:22:18,319
Wait! Time-out!

1006
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,720
You're dead!

1007
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:22,800
Ouch!

1008
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:28,119
Hurry up, Mom.

1009
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:33,760
I hope Riam is okay.

1010
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:46,399
Let's light the blessed tiger's ball.

1011
01:22:46,479 --> 01:22:47,439
You're right.

1012
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:49,079
Come on.

1013
01:22:49,159 --> 01:22:50,720
-Hold it.
-Got it.

1014
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:05,399
It's not working.

1015
01:23:05,479 --> 01:23:07,600
-Try again.
-Okay.

1016
01:23:14,359 --> 01:23:17,479
The matches got soaked in the river.

1017
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:18,960
I think so.

1018
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:23,479
Hurry up!

1019
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:26,359
I'm trying! You can see it's not working!

1020
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:33,720
All right, this one is our last chance.

1021
01:23:44,279 --> 01:23:45,199
Here we go!

1022
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:01,800
No.

1023
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:03,279
Shit.

1024
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,520
-Riam!
-Shit!

1025
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,680
You!

1026
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:15,520
Who are you?

1027
01:24:21,239 --> 01:24:22,399
Riam?

1028
01:24:31,119 --> 01:24:32,760
Finally, you've come to me.

1029
01:24:34,119 --> 01:24:35,880
But you're here to be my wife,

1030
01:24:36,479 --> 01:24:37,960
not to kill me!

1031
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,399
What the hell are you doing?

1032
01:25:13,079 --> 01:25:14,000
The monkey goddess?

1033
01:26:06,680 --> 01:26:08,680
That was pretty easy.

1034
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,680
Ram!

1035
01:27:12,760 --> 01:27:14,680
Mom!

1036
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:17,159
Where's Riam?

1037
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:20,720
She's fighting the bandit!

1038
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,000
Come on.

1039
01:27:36,600 --> 01:27:40,800
Get up, Riam!

1040
01:27:42,079 --> 01:27:44,760
Run! Run, Riam!

1041
01:27:46,520 --> 01:27:50,159
If I can't have you, then you must die!

1042
01:27:56,800 --> 01:27:59,079
-Hurry up. Come on.
-Speed up!

1043
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:00,920
Riam!

1044
01:28:02,279 --> 01:28:03,439
Are you all right?

1045
01:28:04,119 --> 01:28:07,960
Sis, I'm all right.

1046
01:28:08,039 --> 01:28:11,000
No time for hugs. Run!

1047
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,000
Riam!

1048
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:34,880
Ram!

1049
01:28:47,079 --> 01:28:49,039
Light the tiger's ball!

1050
01:28:49,119 --> 01:28:50,239
The matches are wet.

1051
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,680
I'll make a fire.

1052
01:28:53,840 --> 01:28:54,720
Ram!

1053
01:28:54,800 --> 01:28:56,479
Come on.

1054
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:04,840
It's too late!

1055
01:29:54,039 --> 01:29:54,960
Hey!

1056
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,159
It worked!

1057
01:30:07,239 --> 01:30:08,680
-Here.
-Hey!

1058
01:30:11,520 --> 01:30:13,720
Ram!

1059
01:30:14,439 --> 01:30:17,880
-Ram!
-Ram, are you hurt?

1060
01:30:18,399 --> 01:30:20,680
Please don't die.

1061
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:21,760
Ram!

1062
01:30:22,319 --> 01:30:23,239
Riam.

1063
01:30:24,399 --> 01:30:26,039
Bring Mom home safely.

1064
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:30,760
You have to come home with us.

1065
01:30:33,680 --> 01:30:35,279
I'm sorry.

1066
01:30:36,760 --> 01:30:39,399
You're a jealous girl because of me.

1067
01:30:41,359 --> 01:30:45,520
When I'm gone,
you'll be loved by everyone.

1068
01:30:46,319 --> 01:30:50,319
Ram, I'm not jealous of you anymore.

1069
01:30:50,840 --> 01:30:54,079
I realized how much you love me

1070
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:56,119
the day the bandits came to our house.

1071
01:30:57,079 --> 01:30:58,439
And I love you too.

1072
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,119
Ram!

1073
01:31:14,439 --> 01:31:17,640
Hang on.
I hope what I'm thinking is right.

1074
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,760
-Wait right here.
-Ram.

1075
01:31:22,439 --> 01:31:23,960
Which one is it?

1076
01:31:24,039 --> 01:31:26,359
Wake up, Ram.

1077
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:30,079
-There it is!
-What is it?

1078
01:31:31,640 --> 01:31:34,319
The monkey's bullet buster.

1079
01:31:35,720 --> 01:31:38,840
Put it around your neck,
and the bullets will pop out.

1080
01:31:41,159 --> 01:31:42,119
-Really?
-For real?

1081
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,119
Do it now.

1082
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:47,039
Ram.

1083
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:02,640
Ram.

1084
01:32:02,720 --> 01:32:04,560
Ram!

1085
01:32:05,880 --> 01:32:07,039
Ram!

1086
01:32:07,760 --> 01:32:09,000
Ram!

1087
01:32:16,399 --> 01:32:19,560
-You saw it, didn't you?
-Saw what?

1088
01:32:20,399 --> 01:32:24,479
My amulet stopped the bullet.

1089
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,439
-I didn't see it.
-How come you didn't see it?

1090
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,880
I just didn't see it.

1091
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:29,880
Your amulet?

1092
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,640
Exactly.

1093
01:32:31,720 --> 01:32:33,039
Didn't see it either.

1094
01:32:34,199 --> 01:32:35,640
Then why did you mention it?

1095
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:36,640
I'm the hero.

1096
01:32:37,560 --> 01:32:39,000
Hey, I'm the hero!

1097
01:32:39,079 --> 01:32:41,720
Hi! What's up kids?

1098
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:44,880
Mom.

1099
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:48,920
Thank you.

1100
01:32:50,079 --> 01:32:53,479
When the bandits came for me,

1101
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:56,880
you told them you'd die for me.

1102
01:32:59,039 --> 01:33:01,319
Riam, listen to me.

1103
01:33:01,920 --> 01:33:05,079
You've always been
a naughty girl in my eyes,

1104
01:33:05,159 --> 01:33:08,479
but that never stopped me from loving you.

1105
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:12,880
That's so sweet.

1106
01:33:17,479 --> 01:33:20,880
We're all safe.

1107
01:33:26,960 --> 01:33:28,239
You're the best.

1108
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:42,720
I've performed a cleansing ritual.

1109
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:46,840
The monkey goddess
can no longer possess you.

1110
01:33:46,920 --> 01:33:48,960
Amen.

1111
01:33:50,279 --> 01:33:55,279
You should no longer
be jealous of your sister

1112
01:33:56,039 --> 01:34:01,000
because everyone
is now jealous of your courage.

1113
01:34:06,119 --> 01:34:07,880
What's wrong?

1114
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:12,119
If I'm so brave and tough,

1115
01:34:12,199 --> 01:34:14,399
why won't any guy come near me?

1116
01:34:14,479 --> 01:34:15,960
You want a husband, right?

1117
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,079
I guess.

1118
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,079
I have something to tell you.

1119
01:34:21,159 --> 01:34:27,640
Last night, I used my divine power
to see your future.

1120
01:34:27,720 --> 01:34:30,039
Before you meet your soul mate,

1121
01:34:31,159 --> 01:34:33,720
you'll have to suffer through
a terrible pain first.

1122
01:34:35,239 --> 01:34:36,479
A terrible pain?

1123
01:34:37,000 --> 01:34:39,119
But I've just been through
a near-death experience.

1124
01:34:39,199 --> 01:34:40,920
There's more agony for me?

1125
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:44,560
Goodbye, then.
I don't want a soul mate now.

1126
01:34:44,640 --> 01:34:48,800
Do I have to die before
I can find someone who loves me?

1127
01:34:51,880 --> 01:34:54,039
A terrible pain? For real?

1128
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,119
Riam, run!

1129
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:58,399
Tui Tui's gone mad!

1130
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:06,880
Tui Tui!

1131
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:25,680
Tui Tui!

1132
01:35:37,039 --> 01:35:39,800
Tui Tui, I'm your mother!

1133
01:35:41,079 --> 01:35:43,199
You ungrateful beast!

1134
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,640
That was so messed up.

1135
01:36:15,039 --> 01:36:16,239
Wait here.

1136
01:36:20,079 --> 01:36:22,239
I'm sorry. Are you all right?

1137
01:36:26,039 --> 01:36:27,840
Do I look all right?

1138
01:36:27,920 --> 01:36:31,239
You just drop-kicked me into a puddle.

1139
01:36:31,319 --> 01:36:33,520
I was trying to help.

1140
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:35,119
The buffalo stopped suddenly.

1141
01:36:35,960 --> 01:36:37,600
I'm sorry. Let me take a look.

1142
01:36:38,520 --> 01:36:39,439
Don't touch me!

1143
01:36:39,520 --> 01:36:40,680
Let me clean your face.

1144
01:36:40,760 --> 01:36:41,960
Don't touch me!

1145
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:56,720
Six-pack abs…

1146
01:37:25,039 --> 01:37:26,800
What are you doing here, young man?

1147
01:37:29,279 --> 01:37:30,399
Young man?

1148
01:37:31,159 --> 01:37:32,039
I'm a girl.

1149
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:35,960
Get up.

1150
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:40,199
Don't touch me, bitch.

1151
01:37:42,560 --> 01:37:44,079
Let me help you.

1152
01:37:44,800 --> 01:37:48,119
Don't touch me!

1153
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:49,920
Go away.

1154
01:37:58,039 --> 01:37:59,159
Riam.

1155
01:37:59,840 --> 01:38:02,319
So it's you, Kla!

1156
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:09,399
Kla? You know him?

1157
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,239
Of course.

1158
01:38:11,319 --> 01:38:15,439
He's the nice and handsome friend
I told you about.

1159
01:38:17,399 --> 01:38:19,239
I thought I was all right.

1160
01:38:19,319 --> 01:38:21,920
But now I'm aching all over.

1161
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:25,880
I'm suffocating.

1162
01:38:26,399 --> 01:38:27,960
I need someone to give me CPR.

1163
01:38:35,479 --> 01:38:38,720
Bitch, you fell. You didn't drown.

1164
01:38:40,840 --> 01:38:43,279
By the way, what brought you here?

1165
01:38:44,079 --> 01:38:47,359
You asked me to come, remember?
So I came with Thong.

1166
01:38:48,479 --> 01:38:49,399
Thong?

1167
01:38:49,920 --> 01:38:51,960
Thong, my sissy buddy.

1168
01:38:52,640 --> 01:38:55,439
Pumpkin, who's this?

1169
01:38:55,960 --> 01:38:56,920
Riam's sister.

1170
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:01,840
Watch your tits! That's disgusting!

1171
01:39:02,880 --> 01:39:04,720
He looks like the man in my dreams.

1172
01:39:06,199 --> 01:39:07,319
Don't look at me, bitch.

1173
01:39:11,560 --> 01:39:12,880
Stop poking me with your tits.

1174
01:39:25,880 --> 01:39:28,680
Let's go
and leave the new lovebirds alone.

1175
01:39:29,239 --> 01:39:32,439
Well, you two try to get along.

1176
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,399
If you do, great.
If you don't, I'll be right here waiting.

1177
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:40,800
What a tease.

1178
01:39:42,800 --> 01:39:45,479
Go home, Sis.

1179
01:39:48,960 --> 01:39:51,520
What's your family trade?

1180
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:55,199
We make Thai desserts.

1181
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:58,920
Well, that's a ladylike profession.

1182
01:40:01,439 --> 01:40:03,079
So boring.

1183
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:04,439
What?

1184
01:40:05,680 --> 01:40:09,920
I prefer tough girls
who are ready to stand up to men.

1185
01:40:11,720 --> 01:40:13,039
In that case,

1186
01:40:14,119 --> 01:40:15,000
I fit the profile.

1187
01:40:20,840 --> 01:40:22,399
How's that?

1188
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:26,000
Just my type.
