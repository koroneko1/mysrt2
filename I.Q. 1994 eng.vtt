01:34.328 --> 01:36.630
No, no. First,
you should find out

01:36.664 --> 01:39.300
what is the essential nature
of the universe.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.836
Is the universe
an inherently irrational place

01:42.870 --> 01:44.838
random and chaotic?

01:51.412 --> 01:52.846
Chipmunk, your spoon.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.382
Oh.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.284
Your spoon--
it's on the floor.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.485
Oh!

01:57.518 --> 01:58.786
Are you ready
to order?

01:58.819 --> 02:00.188
Uh, yes, I think.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.755
The usual, please.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.791
No. I'll have
a cup of coffee

02:03.824 --> 02:05.393
and a corn muffin,
please.

02:05.426 --> 02:06.594
Ow!

02:06.627 --> 02:08.395
Darling, that is
your usual.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.597
Oh.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.199
Well, I'll have
that then.

02:11.232 --> 02:12.400
Okay.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.601
Thank you.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.203
Aha!
What?

02:15.236 --> 02:18.806
It loses 11,000 molecules
per square centimeter

02:18.839 --> 02:20.308
per second.

02:20.341 --> 02:21.309
What does?

02:21.342 --> 02:24.245
The comet.

02:24.278 --> 02:25.513
Now...

02:25.546 --> 02:27.715
which one of these
do you like best?

02:27.748 --> 02:29.683
Is this a personality test?

02:29.717 --> 02:31.685
Mm, it's a sort
of surprise.

02:31.719 --> 02:33.821
They're all the same.

02:33.854 --> 02:34.822
What? No, no.

02:34.855 --> 02:35.756
Look.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.425
That's aquamarine.

02:37.458 --> 02:39.327
That's blue-green,
and that's algae.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.429
Well, you know
at the atomic level

02:41.462 --> 02:43.431
there's no such thing
as color.

02:43.464 --> 02:45.733
Though they did
do that study

02:45.766 --> 02:47.401
in Belgium that time--

02:47.435 --> 02:48.536
or was it Denmark?

02:48.569 --> 02:49.537
Babbling.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.671
Anyway, babbling.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.373
Anyway, the point
was that...

02:52.406 --> 02:53.607
What was the point?

02:53.641 --> 02:55.943
Oh, that since protons
are so much smaller

02:55.976 --> 02:56.977
than light waves...

02:57.010 --> 02:59.213
Algae.

02:59.247 --> 03:00.314
Thank you.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.915
Since protons are
so much smaller

03:01.949 --> 03:02.916
than light waves

03:02.950 --> 03:04.652
how could they
ever see it

03:04.685 --> 03:05.653
to begin with?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.987
( chuckles )

03:07.020 --> 03:08.856
Oh, those Danes.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.859
( playing "Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star" )

03:11.892 --> 03:16.764
Or is there a fundamental order
underlying all things?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.003
Hey, Captain Marvel?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.338
Shazam?

03:24.372 --> 03:26.574
Oh, thanks.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.543
I was just reading
about Boyd's comet.

03:29.577 --> 03:30.611
Boyd's what?

03:30.644 --> 03:31.879
Comet? Like in the sky?

03:31.912 --> 03:33.881
They say it's going
to be here soon.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.783
We're going to be able
to see it.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.485
You know why a comet's tail

03:37.518 --> 03:39.353
always points
away from the sun?

03:39.387 --> 03:40.354
No.

03:40.388 --> 03:41.355
Want to know?

03:41.389 --> 03:42.690
No.
No.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.758
'Cause it's actually
not a tail at all.

03:44.792 --> 03:47.961
It's, it's bits of gas
that the sun lights up.

03:47.995 --> 03:51.031
We earthlings will try
to keep that in mind.

03:51.064 --> 03:55.469
Kind of like a 500-mile-
long Jersey torch.

03:55.503 --> 03:56.504
Wow.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.307
It must be true.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.641
The fact remains

04:00.674 --> 04:03.644
that certain events
are strictly accidental.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.645
What fact?

04:05.746 --> 04:06.780
( loud backfire )

04:06.814 --> 04:08.382
Oh!

04:08.416 --> 04:11.419
Oh, my, look
at the time.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.486
( loud backfire )

04:12.520 --> 04:13.454
No problem.

04:14.688 --> 04:15.589
( loud backfire )

04:15.623 --> 04:16.656
Oh!

04:16.690 --> 04:18.326
It's because it's spring.

04:18.358 --> 04:20.293
Everything goes
through upheaval

04:20.327 --> 04:22.062
in the spring,
wouldn't you say?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.731
Come on, you
little bitch.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.865
( backfire )

04:24.898 --> 04:26.033
Sounds like business.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.034
M.G.T.F. Roadster.

04:27.067 --> 04:28.035
Austin-Healey.

04:28.068 --> 04:29.036
Cadillac coupe.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.037
Buck.

04:30.070 --> 04:31.038
You're on.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.039
( loud backfire )

04:32.072 --> 04:33.073
Blown intake valve.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.508
Cracked
distributor cap.

04:34.542 --> 04:35.709
Busted muffler.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.946
Are we all victims

04:38.979 --> 04:42.516
of some comic cosmic accident

04:42.550 --> 04:45.686
or is there a grand design?

04:45.719 --> 04:47.921
Oh, what luck.

04:51.992 --> 04:52.960
T.C. Roadster.

04:52.993 --> 04:54.328
That's a T.F.

04:55.863 --> 04:58.098
A couple of college swells.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.967
You handle them, Ed.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.471
Hi, what seems
to be the problem?

05:03.504 --> 05:05.406
Um, uh...

05:07.475 --> 05:08.976
Do you have
anyone here

05:09.009 --> 05:11.479
who knows how to deal
with British automobiles?

05:11.512 --> 05:12.580
I really don't
want anyone

05:12.613 --> 05:13.981
just poking around
in there

05:14.014 --> 05:15.082
with a sharp stick.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.085
Would it be
all right

05:18.118 --> 05:19.853
if I looked
under the bonnet?

05:19.887 --> 05:22.656
Well, at least
he called it a bonnet.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.057
Ah...

05:24.091 --> 05:27.461
so, that's the engine, huh?

05:27.495 --> 05:29.397
Um, look, I think,
perhaps we ought

05:29.430 --> 05:30.864
to go somewhere
else, do you?

05:30.898 --> 05:35.002
( engine chugging )

05:35.035 --> 05:35.969
Intake valve,
I'm tellin' ya.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.004
Busted muffler.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.539
Intake valve.
Busted muffler.

05:38.572 --> 05:39.607
That's your problem
right there.

05:39.640 --> 05:40.608
What?

05:40.641 --> 05:41.609
You got no spark.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.610
What?

05:42.643 --> 05:43.811
You have
no spark.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.546
Yes, I heard him,
Catherine.

05:45.579 --> 05:46.980
What do you think
it means?

05:47.014 --> 05:48.148
Is it the generator?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.116
The coil? What?

05:49.149 --> 05:50.618
Well, it's hard to say.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.953
You see, you have a Lucas
type four generator

05:52.986 --> 05:55.889
on a 12-volt system,
and you know the British.

05:55.923 --> 05:59.159
They'd rather spend time
gluing wood on a dashboard

05:59.192 --> 06:01.895
than getting
the electrical system right.

06:01.929 --> 06:03.096
Fascinating,

06:03.130 --> 06:05.032
but what is wrong
with the car?

06:06.967 --> 06:09.903
Well, my guess is
your stroke is too short

06:09.937 --> 06:12.606
and you're getting
premature ignition.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.908
Does it ever feel
that way?

06:14.942 --> 06:16.109
Like what?

06:16.143 --> 06:17.911
Like the stroke
is too short

06:17.945 --> 06:20.948
and you're getting
premature ignition?

06:20.981 --> 06:24.117
Well, I'm sure I don't
know what you mean.

06:24.151 --> 06:25.786
Could you
just fix it

06:25.819 --> 06:27.788
at least temporarily,
do you think?

06:27.821 --> 06:30.123
We're really running
behind schedule here.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.460
I'll check with my boss.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.827
Don't go away.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.501
He seems nice enough.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.770
He, he's a troglodyte.

06:42.803 --> 06:43.637
Intake valve, right?

06:43.671 --> 06:44.772
Busted muffler?

06:44.805 --> 06:45.773
I'm going
to marry her.

06:45.806 --> 06:46.774
Who? The dame?

06:46.807 --> 06:47.808
Yeah.

06:47.841 --> 06:48.842
Wow, that was fast.

06:48.876 --> 06:49.843
What about the car?

06:49.877 --> 06:51.178
Cracked
distributor cap.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.746
You wouldn't
believe it.

06:52.780 --> 06:54.682
I looked at her,
she looked at me

06:54.715 --> 06:55.816
and it was...
it happened.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.084
You could feel it.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.119
It was like death,
but in a good way.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.120
He's going screwy.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.822
Pop, pop, pop, pop.

07:01.855 --> 07:02.956
It was electric.

07:02.990 --> 07:05.659
And then,
then I kissed her.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.595
You kissed
a customer?

07:07.628 --> 07:08.596
When?

07:08.629 --> 07:09.497
In the future.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.931
It was weird.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.767
It was like time and space
got all mixed up and...

07:13.801 --> 07:15.202
it was like
a Martian mind-meld.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.004
He's cracking up.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.839
All right, look, I want you
to stay away from the magazines.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.040
That's an order.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.108
No, you don't
understand.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.643
It was, it
was, okay...

07:22.676 --> 07:23.811
the past, the present,
and the future

07:23.844 --> 07:25.178
they all went together.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.714
I had kids with her.
I could see the kids.

07:26.747 --> 07:27.981
I had two boys
and three... no.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.249
Three boys,
two boys...

07:29.282 --> 07:30.584
WOMAN:
Excuse me?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.620
How long will all this take?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.726
Well, that's up to you.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.860
It is?

07:39.893 --> 07:42.730
The car,
you nut.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.898
Um, I, uh...

07:44.932 --> 07:47.701
the car, a few days.

07:47.735 --> 07:49.036
That long?

07:49.069 --> 07:51.004
I'm going to have
to give it

07:51.038 --> 07:52.806
my full attention.

07:58.045 --> 08:00.280
Well, in that case,
I better call a phone.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.249
Do you mind if I use your cab?

08:02.282 --> 08:06.286
There's a cab in the office.

08:06.319 --> 08:11.625
EINSTEIN:
Ja, but the uncertainty
principle postulates

08:11.659 --> 08:13.627
a universe of chaos

08:13.661 --> 08:17.264
where everything happens
merely by chance.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.502
Oh, thank you.

08:25.606 --> 08:26.574
What's going on?

08:26.607 --> 08:27.541
We'll take care of it.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.145
Hello? I need a taxi.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.914
Uh, Catherine Boyd.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.549
B-O-Y-D.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.051
What? Oh.

08:38.085 --> 08:40.187
What's the address here?

08:40.220 --> 08:42.590
130 Broad.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.823
130 Broad.

08:43.857 --> 08:47.060
The first stop
is the Silas Paine Institute

08:47.094 --> 08:50.063
then I'm going on
to 112 Mercer.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.665
Is that your address?

08:51.699 --> 08:52.666
112 Mercer.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.034
Two minutes! Thank you.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.202
Bye.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.637
( sighs )

08:59.339 --> 09:00.908
Oh, huh!

09:00.941 --> 09:02.109
Well...

09:02.142 --> 09:03.677
it was Belgium.

09:03.711 --> 09:04.945
It was?

09:04.978 --> 09:05.946
What was?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.047
Mm-hmm. The study.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.081
Thank you.

09:08.115 --> 09:10.651
You're welcome.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.686
James, the taxi will be here
in two minutes.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.954
Oh, well done,
darling.

09:13.987 --> 09:15.689
We'll meet him
on the corner.

09:15.723 --> 09:16.924
Belgium.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.358
Well, thank you.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.827
Two days?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.595
We'll call you.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.296
I, for one, will never believe

09:23.330 --> 09:26.366
that God plays dice
with the universe.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.801
( all chuckling )

09:39.312 --> 09:41.114
We're wasting time.

09:41.148 --> 09:42.115
Come on, serve already.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.851
That's ridiculous.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.386
How can you waste something
that doesn't exist?

09:46.419 --> 09:48.856
What, time doesn't exist?

09:48.889 --> 09:49.823
Since when?

09:49.857 --> 09:51.258
I wouldn't know.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.727
If time doesn't exist,
then there is no "when."

09:53.761 --> 09:55.996
You hear, Liebitzrecht?

09:56.029 --> 09:59.266
Another crazy theory.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.869
Then tell me
the correct time now, huh?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.336
You see?

10:03.370 --> 10:05.806
You can't,
because as you're telling me

10:05.839 --> 10:08.175
the future has already
become the past.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.177
Therefore, there is no present.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.145
Therefore, time doesn't exist!

10:12.179 --> 10:13.613
( laughing )

10:16.116 --> 10:17.050
Oops!

10:21.421 --> 10:24.658
Now your racket doesn't exist.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.299
Oh.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.901
Yes?

10:33.934 --> 10:35.402
You're Albert Einstein.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.104
Thank you.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.438
Wow.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.742
May I say what a great fan
I am of yours?

10:41.775 --> 10:42.743
Thank you.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.211
That thing
you wrote

10:44.244 --> 10:46.413
about light being bent
by gravitation

10:46.446 --> 10:48.348
and the whole relativity thing?

10:48.381 --> 10:50.150
Man, that is... jiving.

10:50.183 --> 10:53.921
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.889
Me, too.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.759
( chuckling )

10:58.792 --> 11:00.393
Uh, can I help you,
Mr....?

11:00.427 --> 11:02.195
Walters, Ed Walters.

11:02.229 --> 11:05.432
Hi. Um... actually, I was
looking for a Catherine Boyd.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.334
I must have
the wrong address.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.236
I'm sorry to
bother you, sir.

11:09.269 --> 11:12.039
Oh, Catherine's my niece.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.140
She's your niece?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.975
She's your niece?

11:15.008 --> 11:16.409
I can't have
a niece?

11:16.443 --> 11:19.246
Well, that would
make you her uncle.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.415
It works nicely,
doesn't it?

11:22.449 --> 11:23.784
Wow!

11:23.817 --> 11:26.820
Well, you see,
I found this...

11:26.854 --> 11:28.922
watch of hers at my garage,
and, uh...

11:28.956 --> 11:30.023
Oh, thank you.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.225
I'll see
that she gets it.

11:32.259 --> 11:35.863
Actually, I was hoping
to return it to her personally.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.231
Why?

11:38.265 --> 11:41.234
( haltingly ):
Let's just say...

11:41.268 --> 11:44.838
it would be beneficial
to her future.

11:44.872 --> 11:48.208
Perhaps you better come in,
Mr. Walters.

11:51.544 --> 11:56.383
Ah, Mr. Walters, may I
present Boris Podolsky

11:56.416 --> 11:58.819
Kurt Godel,
Nathan Liebitzrecht--

11:58.852 --> 12:02.389
three of the greatest minds
of the 20th century

12:02.422 --> 12:07.494
and amongst them,
they can't change a lightbulb.

12:07.527 --> 12:08.528
( all laughing )

12:08.561 --> 12:09.963
Edward, is it?

12:09.997 --> 12:11.331
Yes.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.767
Edward has come to pay
a call on Catherine.

12:13.801 --> 12:14.868
Oh, really.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.003
That's nice.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.038
Very nice.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.015
I could fix
this for you.

12:28.048 --> 12:31.051
Oh, very nice.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.320
Very nice.

12:33.353 --> 12:36.423
Thank you very much.

12:36.456 --> 12:40.293
Oh, that's my compass.

12:40.327 --> 12:44.397
This is what got me started
in my work.

12:44.431 --> 12:48.902
So, young man,
do you think time exists?

12:48.936 --> 12:50.437
Time?

12:53.473 --> 12:56.877
I was just reading
about it

12:56.910 --> 12:59.212
in Future Scienc magazine.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.513
Tell us.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.416
There are these twins,
and one takes a journey

13:03.450 --> 13:05.518
in a spacecraft
at the speed of light

13:05.552 --> 13:08.021
and the other one
stays on Earth.

13:08.055 --> 13:10.824
Well, the twin
that travels into space

13:10.858 --> 13:13.994
comes back years later,
and he's young.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.296
And the one
who stayed on Earth,

13:16.329 --> 13:18.198
by this time,
is very old.

13:18.231 --> 13:22.102
So, so, which one
do you think is happier?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.871
The young one.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.438
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.241
No. The one
that stayed behind.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.342
Why?

13:29.376 --> 13:31.344
Because he's
had a full life

13:31.378 --> 13:33.313
and he's had
experiences

13:33.346 --> 13:34.547
and love and pain

13:34.581 --> 13:36.616
and he has a family
and friends.

13:36.649 --> 13:39.552
And the one who left,

13:39.586 --> 13:42.189
well, time has
just passed.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.423
Yeah.

13:43.456 --> 13:46.193
This is good, no?

13:46.226 --> 13:47.995
( all agreeing )

13:48.028 --> 13:51.331
Tell us, what is
your field of expertise?

13:51.364 --> 13:52.933
My job?

13:52.966 --> 13:55.102
I'm a...
I'm an auto mechanic.

13:55.135 --> 13:59.272
See the U.S.A.
In your Chevrolet, ja?

13:59.306 --> 14:03.510
Edward, what do you know
about gravity?

14:03.543 --> 14:04.644
Gravity?

14:04.677 --> 14:05.913
Yeah.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.148
We have a little
gravity problem.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.217
Please be careful, Edward.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.651
Take it easy.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.020
So, what do
you think

14:13.053 --> 14:14.021
of our Catherine,
Mr. Walters?

14:14.054 --> 14:15.388
I think she's wonderful.

14:15.422 --> 14:17.991
Wonderful to the power
of three.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.259
What power of three?

14:19.292 --> 14:20.660
To the power of ten!

14:20.693 --> 14:21.995
We all love her.

14:22.029 --> 14:23.530
She's engaged,
you know.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.032
Yeah, I know.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.433
I saw the ring.

14:26.466 --> 14:30.003
He's a professor
of experimental
psychology

14:30.037 --> 14:31.138
James, uh...

14:31.171 --> 14:33.006
Morland.
The rat man.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.374
You know
what he does?

14:34.407 --> 14:36.143
He puts electrodes

14:36.176 --> 14:39.046
on the genitals
of the rats.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.648
Some day,
I do that to him.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.989
Ah, we threw the racket up
to get the birdie.

14:51.558 --> 14:54.694
We threw Godel's cane up there
to get the racket.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.297
I threw Podolsky's

14:57.330 --> 14:59.699
golf club up there

14:59.732 --> 15:01.401
to get even
with him.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.136
We're going

15:03.170 --> 15:05.205
to throw Godel up there next.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.307
( chuckles ):
Yeah.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.309
It's a vicious tree.

15:09.342 --> 15:10.543
Edward

15:10.577 --> 15:12.579
Edward, what makes you think

15:12.612 --> 15:14.681
that she would be better off

15:14.714 --> 15:18.151
with you?

15:18.185 --> 15:20.687
I don't know. Just a feeling.

15:20.720 --> 15:22.289
A feeling?

15:22.322 --> 15:23.690
What kind of feeling?

15:25.458 --> 15:27.627
This is going to sound crazy.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.062
That's all right.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.230
You can tell us.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.732
We are all
a little crazy here.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.336
Well, when she came
in the garage...

15:36.369 --> 15:41.374
it was like everything
slowed down, and got

15:41.408 --> 15:44.111
very clear.

15:44.144 --> 15:46.346
It's like when you're
milling a camshaft

15:46.379 --> 15:48.215
or grinding down the curve
on a fender.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.983
A-A-And as you're doing it,

15:50.017 --> 15:52.719
you just know everything is
going to work out perfect.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.422
Everything's
going to fit.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.723
You know?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.293
You ever have that feeling?

16:00.327 --> 16:02.295
Yeah, one time in 1905.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.630
( branch snaps )

16:03.663 --> 16:05.398
Watch out.
Watch out now!

16:07.267 --> 16:10.170
Mr. Walters,
are you all right?

16:13.440 --> 16:16.743
That gravity--
it's a killer.

16:16.776 --> 16:21.714
Mr. Bamberger, I don't know
what it is you think I can do.

16:21.748 --> 16:23.450
I'm finishing my thesis.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.153
I do some administrative work
for my Uncle Albert...

16:26.186 --> 16:27.620
but he adores you.
They all do.

16:27.654 --> 16:28.755
They'll listen to you.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.057
No, no, no, sit here.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.158
Get the full effect.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.425
Please.

16:32.459 --> 16:33.693
Catherine, I
know I funded

16:33.726 --> 16:35.395
the Institute for
Advanced Study

16:35.428 --> 16:37.064
as a place for
pure thought...

16:37.097 --> 16:39.799
but... but...
the symposium next week...

16:39.832 --> 16:42.135
it's our last chance.

16:42.169 --> 16:44.237
My accountants
are all over me.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.640
Sit a little closer.

16:50.177 --> 16:52.079
Tell your uncle
we need something...

16:52.112 --> 16:53.646
a new invention
for New Jersey--

16:53.680 --> 16:55.582
something that can be...
bought here

16:55.615 --> 16:57.317
something that
can be made here

16:57.350 --> 16:59.519
something that can be
launched from here.

16:59.552 --> 17:02.489
It's important
for the institute.

17:02.522 --> 17:06.093
Stereo hi-fidelity.

17:06.126 --> 17:09.195
* In some secluded rendezvous

17:09.229 --> 17:10.563
( music turns raucous )

17:10.597 --> 17:12.531
Spike Jones!

17:13.766 --> 17:15.768
Move a little closer.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.472
It sounds like
he's right here

17:19.506 --> 17:21.574
like you could reach out
and touch him.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.410
Or slap him.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.713
You were attracted
to the earth

17:26.746 --> 17:29.716
at 32 feet per second
per second.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.584
( laughing ):
I believe it.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.689
Ah, such a
beautiful day.

17:38.758 --> 17:42.195
Come, we'll find Catherine

17:42.229 --> 17:44.231
and you'll give her
the watch.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.768
Look at this.

17:48.801 --> 17:49.669
( sighs )

17:49.702 --> 17:50.870
You know...

17:50.903 --> 17:53.673
when I was a patent
clerk in Switzerland

17:53.706 --> 17:56.776
I used to wonder what the
universe would look like

17:56.809 --> 18:00.147
if I was traveling at
the speed of light...

18:00.180 --> 18:03.216
on a motorcycle.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.855
GIRL:
Hello, professor Einstein!

18:08.888 --> 18:10.523
EDWARD:
How you doing, doc?

18:10.557 --> 18:11.891
EINSTEIN:
Good. Very good.

18:11.924 --> 18:15.128
I always wanted
a convertible.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.468
Wahoo!

18:39.419 --> 18:42.222
( Einstein speaking German )

18:42.255 --> 18:43.256
What?

18:43.290 --> 18:43.890
Faster.

18:43.923 --> 18:45.325
Faster.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.126
Okay, hang on, doc.

19:08.281 --> 19:10.550
Wahoo!

19:17.424 --> 19:19.759
MAN:
Please...

19:19.792 --> 19:21.961
Help... help!

19:21.994 --> 19:22.962
James...

19:22.995 --> 19:24.297
Ah, professor.

19:24.331 --> 19:25.532
I was looking
for Catherine.

19:25.565 --> 19:26.899
Is she here?

19:26.933 --> 19:28.535
No. No, but I'm glad
you've come anyway.

19:28.568 --> 19:29.769
MAN:
Dr. Morland!

19:29.802 --> 19:31.338
I'm not going to do
your test anymore!

19:31.371 --> 19:32.439
Shouldn't somebody
help this guy?

19:32.472 --> 19:33.906
Oh, he's all right.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.408
It's a time
deprivation
experiment.

19:35.442 --> 19:37.677
Go on. Have a look.

19:37.710 --> 19:39.612
( screaming )

19:39.646 --> 19:42.415
This is right out
of Martians Ate My Brain.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.417
Have you ever read
that story?

19:44.451 --> 19:45.718
Don't I know you?

19:45.752 --> 19:47.320
This is my friend Edward.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.456
We're working
on something together.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.658
Really? What?

19:51.691 --> 19:54.227
Attraction at a distance.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.462
Well... shall
we, uh...

19:55.495 --> 19:57.297
go and have a look
at the, uh...

19:57.330 --> 20:00.300
and, uh, please, don't touch
anything, will you?

20:00.333 --> 20:01.868
( screaming )

20:01.901 --> 20:06.306
Let me show you
the mouse I was
talking about.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.574
He's just around here.

20:09.509 --> 20:10.877
Now, the mouse has learned

20:10.910 --> 20:12.645
that the red lever
will give him

20:12.679 --> 20:14.581
an electrical stimulus
in the brain

20:14.614 --> 20:16.616
that's something akin
to sexual climax

20:16.649 --> 20:17.617
and the blue lever

20:17.650 --> 20:19.519
will dispense him food.

20:19.552 --> 20:22.689
Now, this one here

20:22.722 --> 20:23.990
hasn't eaten
for three days.

20:24.023 --> 20:24.991
( buzzing )

20:25.024 --> 20:25.992
There.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.827
Now, why would he do that?

20:31.964 --> 20:35.502
Uh... excuse me
a moment, will you?

20:35.535 --> 20:38.004
Gretchen, would you, um...

20:40.373 --> 20:42.375
that's curious.

20:42.409 --> 20:45.912
That fellow in the booth
calmed down so quickly.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.880
Yes. Funny, huh?

20:47.914 --> 20:48.948
Where's your watch?

20:48.981 --> 20:50.016
Huh?

20:50.049 --> 20:51.951
You were wearing
a wristwatch.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.821
Well, I figured
since time doesn't exist--

20:54.854 --> 20:57.023
who needs a watch?

21:20.413 --> 21:21.681
That was ausgezeichnet.

21:21.714 --> 21:22.782
Thank you very much.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.083
You're very welcome.

21:24.116 --> 21:27.554
Next time I bring
my goggles, ja?

21:27.587 --> 21:29.088
All right, doc.

21:29.121 --> 21:32.392
( singing "Eine
Kleine Nachtmusik" )

21:34.961 --> 21:37.029
Ah, Catherine...

21:46.739 --> 21:47.740
Hi.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.978
The garage.

21:52.011 --> 21:54.113
He's quite a guy, your uncle.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.482
Yes, he... he...

21:55.515 --> 21:56.616
Do you know him?

21:56.649 --> 21:59.018
I get around.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.454
Did you take him
on that thing?

22:01.488 --> 22:02.455
Uh-huh.

22:02.489 --> 22:03.856
You took Albert Einstein

22:03.890 --> 22:05.425
for a ride
on a motorcycle?

22:05.458 --> 22:06.726
Uh-huh.

22:06.759 --> 22:08.595
Well, don't ever do that again.
Why not?

22:08.628 --> 22:10.463
Because he could've
been killed.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.498
He loved it.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.465
He went "wahoo."

22:12.499 --> 22:13.766
Wahoo?

22:13.800 --> 22:16.469
When was the last time
he went "wahoo"?

22:16.503 --> 22:18.471
Well, I'm sure
I don't know.

22:18.505 --> 22:21.474
When was the last time
you went "wahoo"?

22:21.508 --> 22:23.376
Well, I'm sure I don't know.

22:23.410 --> 22:25.645
Want a... want a lift?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.914
On that?

22:27.947 --> 22:29.616
No.

22:29.649 --> 22:30.717
No.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.552
No.

22:32.585 --> 22:35.455
( like Marlon Brando ):
Come on, what could happen?

22:35.488 --> 22:36.723
So you die a little.

22:42.795 --> 22:44.397
Hey, help me out,
will you?

22:44.431 --> 22:45.465
I'm a little nervous.

22:45.498 --> 22:46.666
Oh, really? Why?

22:46.699 --> 22:48.735
I'm trying to figure
out the best way

22:48.768 --> 22:49.902
to ask you to dinner.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.472
Uh... mister...

22:52.505 --> 22:53.973
Walters. Ed.

22:54.006 --> 22:55.408
Right.

22:55.442 --> 22:57.076
I'm sure you're
a very nice person

22:57.109 --> 23:00.012
and I'm happy to know
that my future automotive safety

23:00.046 --> 23:02.014
is in your large,
very capable hands

23:02.048 --> 23:04.584
but I-I really should
be going that way

23:04.617 --> 23:06.886
so... good-bye.

23:06.919 --> 23:10.923
Well, then dinner's
out of the question.

23:10.957 --> 23:11.924
Yeah.

23:11.958 --> 23:13.760
So I should give you this.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.095
You found it.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.196
You left it.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.197
You fixed it.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.198
I polished it.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.467
Thank you.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.503
And I tightened the screws.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.204
I can feel that.

23:25.237 --> 23:27.173
It's very pretty.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.209
It was my father's.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.879
I thought I'd lost it.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.080
Thank you.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.548
You're welcome.

23:37.584 --> 23:40.152
Um...I'm sorry
if I was abrupt before.

23:40.186 --> 23:42.221
No problem.

23:42.254 --> 23:44.557
( laughing )

23:44.591 --> 23:45.625
What?

23:45.658 --> 23:46.859
Astonishing.

23:46.893 --> 23:49.696
An unmistakable
chemical reaction.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.063
What?

23:53.132 --> 23:55.234
What?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.203
Marlon Brando.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.708
( laughing )

24:03.876 --> 24:05.244
Maybe not.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.613
( grunts )

24:08.247 --> 24:09.549
So, James?

24:09.582 --> 24:10.583
Yes?

24:10.617 --> 24:12.151
Where is it to be?

24:12.184 --> 24:13.853
Where is what to be,
Duncan?

24:13.886 --> 24:15.822
The honeymoon, man,
the honeymoon.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.090
What have you two
lovebirds decided on?

24:18.124 --> 24:20.860
Uh, well, we haven't really
discussed it much.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.563
Um, though I was thinking
the Ituri forest

24:23.596 --> 24:25.064
in the Belgian Congo.

24:25.097 --> 24:26.799
The Ituri forest.
Excellent.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.969
There's a pygmy village
near the Embouti settlement.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.638
You know it,
don't you, Duncan?

24:31.671 --> 24:33.105
Yes, it's fascinating.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.575
Sort of a complete pygmy package
if you'd like.

24:35.608 --> 24:38.077
There's hospitality heart,
wild boar roast

24:38.110 --> 24:40.279
you wash in the river,
tribal rituals...

24:40.312 --> 24:41.914
that sort of a thing.

24:41.948 --> 24:44.617
It's like being one
of the tribe, really.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.819
It's the opportunity
of a lifetime.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.120
I like it.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.690
I was thinking
more along the lines

24:50.723 --> 24:52.892
of a million kisses
on your skin.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.694
I beg your pardon, chimpmunk?

24:54.727 --> 24:57.530
On Maui they have
these natural slides

24:57.564 --> 25:00.833
formed from these
volcanic eruptions
of obsidian

25:00.867 --> 25:02.535
and you go climbing up

25:02.569 --> 25:04.937
and then you go sliding
down a hundred feet

25:04.971 --> 25:07.574
into what they call
the Seven Sacred Pools.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.809
And the water is so aerated

25:09.842 --> 25:13.012
that it feels like
a million kisses on your skin

25:13.045 --> 25:16.883
or like an enormous tongue
just licking your entire body.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.586
( James clears throat )

25:19.619 --> 25:20.987
Dean, do you remember

25:21.020 --> 25:23.322
we were talking
about the funding?

25:23.355 --> 25:24.924
Obsidian slides

25:24.957 --> 25:27.093
and great
licking tongues?

25:27.126 --> 25:29.862
My god, he's the head
of the whole department.

25:31.097 --> 25:32.699
( whispering ):
James?
Hmm?

25:32.732 --> 25:34.701
How would you like
a million kisses

25:34.734 --> 25:35.835
on your skin?

25:35.868 --> 25:37.036
What?

25:37.069 --> 25:39.572
What if we have our own
primitive ritual

25:39.606 --> 25:40.840
right here.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.208
Have you gone mad?!

25:42.241 --> 25:43.776
What are you doing?!

25:49.782 --> 25:52.084
You don't love me.

25:52.118 --> 25:55.021
What, because I won't make love
to you in the middle

25:55.054 --> 25:56.689
of some
dinner party?

25:56.723 --> 25:59.025
Catherine,
how can you say
such a thing?

25:59.058 --> 26:01.160
You know I love you
more than anything.

26:01.193 --> 26:03.663
You're my little
munchkin, aren't you?

26:03.696 --> 26:05.231
I don't know, James.
Am I?

26:05.264 --> 26:06.966
But of course
you are.

26:06.999 --> 26:09.368
My little
munchy munchkin.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.738
Look, I wasn't going to
tell you this till later

26:11.771 --> 26:13.973
but you remember that
surprise I told you about?

26:14.006 --> 26:15.107
No.

26:15.141 --> 26:16.275
The cards.
The color cards.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.844
Yes.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.846
Well, when we come home
from our honeymoon

26:19.879 --> 26:22.114
we're going to have
a home to come home to.

26:22.148 --> 26:24.283
In Stanford.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.686
Oh...

26:26.719 --> 26:27.887
Full professor

26:27.920 --> 26:29.689
Department
of Applied Psychology.

26:29.722 --> 26:31.123
And it comes

26:31.157 --> 26:33.225
with its own
little munchkin nest.

26:33.259 --> 26:35.728
And you already
picked out the color.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.063
EINSTEIN:
Algae.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.398
This is a color?

26:39.431 --> 26:42.268
CATHERINE:
And there'll be plenty
of room for the children.

26:42.301 --> 26:43.736
Children...

26:43.770 --> 26:44.937
James says that
spacing them

26:44.971 --> 26:46.272
three and a half
years apart

26:46.305 --> 26:48.274
is optimal for their
mental development.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.010
But what about your
mental development?

26:51.043 --> 26:52.679
What?

26:52.712 --> 26:54.346
Your research.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.749
I don't know.

26:56.783 --> 26:59.752
Sometimes I wonder
if I wouldn't be a better mother

26:59.786 --> 27:01.754
than a mechanic...
mathematician.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.925
Catherine...

27:05.958 --> 27:08.895
when your father asked me
to care for you

27:08.928 --> 27:13.232
I tried to tell him
that the things I know

27:13.265 --> 27:17.236
are not very useful
in the real world.

27:17.269 --> 27:19.305
And that's why
I'm so lucky

27:19.338 --> 27:21.240
that I have James.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.910
We have common goals
and interests.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.713
He's brilliant,
organized, a planner.

27:26.746 --> 27:30.049
I find him
very stimulating.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.383
Intellectually.

27:31.417 --> 27:34.053
Yeah, but what about love,
Catherine?

27:34.086 --> 27:35.387
( cover clanking )

27:35.421 --> 27:37.456
What?!

27:37.489 --> 27:39.726
I said when does this
all happen--

27:39.759 --> 27:41.728
this wonderful, organized life?

27:41.761 --> 27:42.929
In September.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.931
They say Stanford
is beautiful.

27:44.964 --> 27:46.332
That's what they say.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.100
This is the happiest day

27:48.134 --> 27:50.036
of my
entire life.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.147
Don't worry, liebchen.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.314
It will work out.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.956
( sighs )

28:09.989 --> 28:12.358
( speaks German )

28:12.391 --> 28:14.093
( speaks German )

28:14.126 --> 28:15.694
I promise.

28:18.397 --> 28:20.833
* Awop-bop-a-loo-mop-
alop-bam-boom *

28:20.867 --> 28:23.369
* Got a gal named Sue

28:23.402 --> 28:25.772
* She knows just what to do...

28:25.805 --> 28:27.874
PODOLSKY:
I'm crazy
about this song.

28:27.907 --> 28:29.241
Get him.

28:29.275 --> 28:30.509
What are you,
Podolsky,

28:30.542 --> 28:31.844
a hep cat?

28:31.878 --> 28:33.980
No. I'm an American.

28:34.013 --> 28:35.481
Oh... so
what is it,

28:35.514 --> 28:36.849
Mr. hep cat
American?

28:36.883 --> 28:39.485
I know.
It's a... it's a...

28:39.518 --> 28:40.519
Look out!

28:40.552 --> 28:42.454
( tires squealing )

28:44.023 --> 28:45.124
Learn to drive

28:45.157 --> 28:46.392
for God's sake!

28:46.425 --> 28:48.360
They should make
people pass a test

28:48.394 --> 28:49.962
before they
let them drive!

28:49.996 --> 28:51.831
You had
to pass a test.

28:51.864 --> 28:53.866
How else could you
get a license?

28:53.900 --> 28:56.869
A license?

28:56.903 --> 28:58.971
It's "tutti frutti"
or hutti?

28:59.005 --> 29:00.272
Quiet!

29:00.306 --> 29:04.010
What is wrong
with you today, Albert?

29:04.043 --> 29:05.011
Eh!

29:05.044 --> 29:06.312
Catherine--

29:06.345 --> 29:08.480
she should be having
more fun.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.150
What she needs
is a young man.

29:11.183 --> 29:14.153
She should go out,
go dancing...

29:14.186 --> 29:15.922
A little schtupping.

29:15.955 --> 29:17.023
GODEL:
Come on.

29:17.056 --> 29:18.257
Nathan, please.

29:18.290 --> 29:19.859
PODOLSKY:
She thinks schtupping

29:19.892 --> 29:21.794
is a town in Bavaria.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.297
Where are you taking us,
Albert?

29:25.331 --> 29:30.169
Well, boys, how would you like
to have a convertible?

29:31.470 --> 29:33.539
Excellent!
Excellent.

29:42.614 --> 29:45.885
( hubcap rolling )

29:53.893 --> 29:56.228
Phew!

29:56.262 --> 29:57.329
Perfect.

29:57.363 --> 29:58.530
Oh, beautiful.

30:00.632 --> 30:02.201
Sir?

30:03.635 --> 30:06.839
It's very nice
upholstery.

30:06.873 --> 30:08.574
You're Albert Einstein.

30:08.607 --> 30:11.944
E = mc squared.

30:11.978 --> 30:14.881
I hope so.

30:14.914 --> 30:17.283
Tell me, this comes
from the factory like this?

30:17.316 --> 30:18.885
Oh, no, no.
It's all custom.

30:18.918 --> 30:19.952
I can't believe it--

30:19.986 --> 30:20.987
in my garage.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.254
This is a real honor.

30:22.288 --> 30:24.423
Frankie, this is
Professor Einstein,

30:24.456 --> 30:26.492
the smartest person
in the world.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.460
How they hanging?

30:30.897 --> 30:32.264
Edward!

30:32.298 --> 30:33.532
Hey, doc.

30:33.565 --> 30:34.600
Edward.

30:34.633 --> 30:36.368
There it is.

30:36.402 --> 30:37.569
What do you think?

30:37.603 --> 30:38.637
Is it possible?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.106
Sure. Anything's
possible.

30:40.139 --> 30:41.908
He wants to turn
that into this...

30:41.941 --> 30:42.909
Convertible.

30:42.942 --> 30:44.443
No problem.

30:44.476 --> 30:46.578
You were talking about the
full treatment, Professor?

30:46.612 --> 30:49.048
Ja, ja.
The whole ball of wax.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.316
( honks horn )

30:50.349 --> 30:51.583
Podolsky, stop that.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.585
Okay, so we
chop the top,

30:53.619 --> 30:55.587
do a modified nose
and deck...

30:55.621 --> 30:57.056
Fill and block.

30:57.089 --> 30:58.991
French tuck and roll
on the inside.

30:59.025 --> 31:00.259
Dago the front?

31:00.292 --> 31:01.527
Just a touch.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.262
Quad barrels
for the mill.

31:03.295 --> 31:04.997
A master kit.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.265
Hot coil.

31:06.298 --> 31:07.533
Stinger exhaust.

31:07.566 --> 31:09.268
High nickel chrome.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.669
Sound good?

31:10.702 --> 31:12.271
Like Mozart.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.040
You know,
I recall

31:14.073 --> 31:16.909
here someplace is
an ice cream parlor.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.277
Come, we get a scoop.

31:18.310 --> 31:20.012
Doc, actually,
it's this way.

31:20.046 --> 31:21.280
Is it all right?

31:21.313 --> 31:22.548
Yeah, go, go.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.016
Thank you
very much.

31:24.050 --> 31:25.884
Sure.
Sure.

31:30.356 --> 31:33.325
When I first arrived
here in 1933,

31:33.359 --> 31:37.329
I went and bought one
of these triple scoops.

31:37.363 --> 31:38.931
What flavor?

31:38.965 --> 31:40.532
Peppermint.

31:40.566 --> 31:41.633
You see?

31:41.667 --> 31:43.335
This is a good question.

31:43.369 --> 31:44.937
"What flavor?"

31:44.971 --> 31:48.975
Simple, specific,
and it has an answer.

31:49.008 --> 31:51.310
EINSTEIN:
You read a lot
of science fiction.

31:51.343 --> 31:56.248
Tell me, do you think they'll
ever find intelligent life

31:56.282 --> 31:58.517
anywhere in the universe?

31:58.550 --> 32:00.719
They're still looking
for intelligent life

32:00.752 --> 32:02.188
here on Earth.

32:02.221 --> 32:04.190
( laughing )

32:06.192 --> 32:09.195
EINSTEIN:
You know, Catherine--
she's a brilliant mathematician

32:09.228 --> 32:11.030
but she lacks confidence.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.699
She thinks her contribution
to the world

32:13.732 --> 32:15.534
will be through
her children.

32:15.567 --> 32:18.437
She has this crazy idea

32:18.470 --> 32:22.241
that if she marries
an intellectual

32:22.274 --> 32:25.444
she will have
genius children

32:25.477 --> 32:28.080
or something like that.

32:28.114 --> 32:31.083
Catherine--
she's too smart for that.

32:31.117 --> 32:32.751
Oh, she's too smart here.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.286
But not here.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.455
What she needs
is to go out

32:36.488 --> 32:38.157
with someone
like you.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.558
The problem is

32:39.591 --> 32:43.229
she would never go out
with someone like you.

32:43.262 --> 32:44.496
That's easy.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.232
Just lend me
your brain

32:46.265 --> 32:47.566
for a couple of days.

32:50.436 --> 32:51.670
What?

32:51.703 --> 32:55.707
Are you thinking
what I am thinking?

32:55.741 --> 32:58.544
What would be the odds
of that happening?

33:04.816 --> 33:06.152
It's still
not right.

33:06.185 --> 33:07.319
What?

33:07.353 --> 33:09.121
He doesn't look
like a scientist.

33:09.155 --> 33:12.058
So, what's the plan again, doc?

33:12.091 --> 33:13.459
Here, try this.

33:13.492 --> 33:16.362
The plan is
we talk science.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.097
We have something
to eat.

33:18.130 --> 33:19.731
We drink some schnapps.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.400
And we talk about life.

33:21.433 --> 33:22.734
I think it's
too fashionable.

33:22.768 --> 33:24.236
Yeah, yeah.

33:24.270 --> 33:27.239
Here-- take some.
There's a coat.

33:27.273 --> 33:28.407
Wait, wait.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.242
Nathan,
your cardigan.

33:32.811 --> 33:35.781
ED:
What do I do
if she asks me a question?

33:35.814 --> 33:37.249
Ah.

33:37.283 --> 33:38.617
She asks you
a question...

33:38.650 --> 33:42.088
here-- you pretend
to smoke a pipe.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.555
And then you say,

33:43.589 --> 33:45.691
"Interesting concept."

33:45.724 --> 33:47.626
Don't worry.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.828
We'll change the subject.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.697
Change the subject?

33:51.730 --> 33:53.799
You know, like in football.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.801
We'll run interference.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.403
And now...

33:57.436 --> 33:58.670
this is a tie.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.739
Here-- this will
hold up your pants.

34:00.772 --> 34:01.773
Good, huh?

34:01.807 --> 34:02.808
Yeah.

34:02.841 --> 34:05.311
Yeah.

34:05.344 --> 34:07.379
He looks
like a French
impressionist.

34:07.413 --> 34:08.514
Yeah, yeah.

34:28.667 --> 34:30.402
ED:
...the nuclear
configuration

34:30.436 --> 34:32.237
is given by
the expectation value

34:32.271 --> 34:35.373
of the nuclear Hamiltonian,
in a state with "M" neutrons...

34:35.407 --> 34:37.443
( men murmuring )

34:37.476 --> 34:40.612
...Will occur if the energy
of the fuse state is lower

34:40.646 --> 34:41.813
than the energy of...

34:41.847 --> 34:43.349
( men murmuring )

34:43.382 --> 34:46.217
Our task is to see
if the dynamics dictated

34:46.252 --> 34:48.219
by the interaction
Hamiltonian

34:48.254 --> 34:50.755
generates a sufficiently
rapid reaction

34:50.789 --> 34:53.759
to make cold fusion-powered
engines feasible.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.092
Hello.

34:56.161 --> 34:57.296
Hello.

34:57.329 --> 34:58.430
Hello, liebchen.

35:00.399 --> 35:01.767
So, we have here

35:01.800 --> 35:04.603
E over C squared.

35:04.636 --> 35:06.738
ED:
It's E squared.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.707
Minus E squared
over B

35:08.740 --> 35:10.442
minus V of X.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.744
( men murmuring )

35:16.815 --> 35:18.750
Uh, what's going on?

35:18.784 --> 35:20.452
It seems our friend Edward here

35:20.486 --> 35:23.389
has been holding out
on us.

35:23.422 --> 35:27.693
In addition to being
a very fine automotive mechanic

35:27.726 --> 35:31.797
he is also in physics
something of a wunderkind.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.265
( men agreeing )

35:33.299 --> 35:34.633
A wunderkind.

35:34.666 --> 35:35.767
I, I had this idea.

35:35.801 --> 35:36.935
I ran it by the doc

35:36.968 --> 35:38.704
and we worked
on it together

35:38.737 --> 35:41.273
and everybody thought
it wasn't so bad.

35:41.307 --> 35:42.641
So! "It wasn't so bad."

35:42.674 --> 35:43.742
It was astonishing.

35:43.775 --> 35:45.177
Very innovative.

35:45.211 --> 35:47.246
Well, do I get to hear
what it is?

35:48.680 --> 35:50.482
I figured out how to build

35:50.516 --> 35:53.552
a nuclear-powered
spacecraft engine, I think.

35:53.585 --> 35:54.820
A fusion engine.

35:54.853 --> 35:56.255
A what?!

35:56.288 --> 35:57.689
The process
that fuels the stars.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.558
We're going to put it
in a bottle.

35:59.591 --> 36:02.494
Cold fusion.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.430
It's mind-boggling.

36:04.463 --> 36:05.931
He's a mechanic.

36:05.964 --> 36:08.467
I was a clerk
in a patent office.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.302
Faraday was a carpenter.

36:10.336 --> 36:13.171
Isaac Newton was an
insurance salesman.

36:14.740 --> 36:15.841
Fusion.

36:15.874 --> 36:17.643
Fusion.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.745
Really?
Well, what are you wearing?

36:19.778 --> 36:23.649
What difference does it make
what he is wearing?

36:23.682 --> 36:28.787
A nuclear-powered spacecraft.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.589
( all murmuring )

36:30.622 --> 36:32.924
Well, that's perfect
for New Jersey.

36:32.958 --> 36:34.393
New Jersey?

36:34.426 --> 36:35.827
The symposium.

36:35.861 --> 36:37.629
I don't suppose you
have a paper on this.

36:37.663 --> 36:38.497
Paper?

36:38.530 --> 36:39.498
No, no, you see,

36:39.531 --> 36:41.367
there are certain details...

36:41.400 --> 36:43.302
We must check
the spelling.

36:43.335 --> 36:45.471
We could have it ready.

36:45.504 --> 36:46.572
You could?

36:46.605 --> 36:47.806
Yeah. Sure.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.341
Couldn't we?

36:49.375 --> 36:50.642
EINSTEIN:
Ja, we could.

36:52.010 --> 36:53.379
When is

36:53.412 --> 36:54.546
the symposium?

36:54.580 --> 36:56.648
April 1.

36:56.682 --> 36:57.916
Five days.

36:57.949 --> 36:59.651
That's not
a problem.

36:59.685 --> 37:00.886
Oh, this is great!

37:00.919 --> 37:02.854
Bamberger will be thrilled.

37:02.888 --> 37:04.756
I am

37:04.790 --> 37:06.425
very grateful.

37:06.458 --> 37:07.793
This is so...

37:07.826 --> 37:09.328
huge, really.

37:12.398 --> 37:16.268
Isaac Newton was not
an insurance salesman.

37:18.837 --> 37:20.606
( door shuts )

37:24.710 --> 37:26.778
W-what?

37:26.812 --> 37:30.882
Boys, our little experiment

37:30.916 --> 37:33.952
has just jumped
to a higher energy level.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.788
( Edward mumbling )

37:36.822 --> 37:38.657
Over X...

37:38.690 --> 37:40.492
minus Y to the X + Y...

37:40.526 --> 37:41.727
Minus Y to the X...

37:41.760 --> 37:43.295
What language is that, Martian?

37:43.329 --> 37:44.596
Wait, wait a minute, wait.

37:44.630 --> 37:45.897
You're not changing anything,
are you?

37:45.931 --> 37:46.932
No.

37:46.965 --> 37:48.300
Well, what's
all that?

37:48.334 --> 37:49.368
Nothing.

37:49.401 --> 37:50.869
All right, grab your scalpel.

37:50.902 --> 37:52.170
Let's operate.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.008
( laughs )

37:57.042 --> 37:58.544
I don't believe it!

37:58.577 --> 38:00.078
Einstein's car!

38:00.111 --> 38:01.747
We do this right,
Eddie boy,

38:01.780 --> 38:04.049
we're going to have
a whole new clientele!

38:04.082 --> 38:05.317
Whoo!

38:10.989 --> 38:13.759
Welcome to the first
international physics symposium

38:13.792 --> 38:17.396
designed to bring together
the very best minds.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.665
It's time, Edward.

38:19.698 --> 38:24.503
Now, this is the largest
gathering of the scientific...

38:24.536 --> 38:25.971
I can't do this.

38:26.004 --> 38:29.641
Why? Because you're sick
with fear and anxiety?

38:29.675 --> 38:30.842
99% Of the world

38:30.876 --> 38:33.445
wakes up like this
every morning.

38:33.479 --> 38:34.346
Every morning.

38:34.380 --> 38:35.681
Every morning.

38:35.714 --> 38:41.587
Edward, just remember
why you are doing this.

38:41.620 --> 38:46.358
Many of the mysteries
that we, until now, only...

38:46.392 --> 38:48.126
She's not even here.

38:48.159 --> 38:49.928
It's not as if
he's even ever shown

38:49.961 --> 38:51.697
any signs
of normal intelligence.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.365
Think of that--
nuclear fusion.

38:53.399 --> 38:54.800
I suppose
these things happen.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.001
Idiot savant-- you know,

38:56.034 --> 38:57.869
a mental patient
plays perfect chess

38:57.903 --> 38:59.471
a nine-year-old from Alabama

38:59.505 --> 39:01.807
suddenly starts speaking
in iambic pentameter.

39:01.840 --> 39:03.709
( gasping ):
James, it's packed!

39:03.742 --> 39:05.411
To open our program

39:05.444 --> 39:07.613
here, delivering
his paper

39:07.646 --> 39:11.883
entitled "Cold Fusion-Powered
Exploration Paradigms"

39:11.917 --> 39:14.486
is our very own Edward Walters.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.830
Edward Walters.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.470
Dr. Walters?

39:31.503 --> 39:33.572
Dr. Walters?

39:34.740 --> 39:36.575
Doctor...?

39:36.608 --> 39:38.744
( applause )

39:52.858 --> 39:55.160
Are you all right,
Dr. Walters?

39:55.193 --> 39:57.529
Ed.

39:57.563 --> 39:58.997
Ed?

40:02.734 --> 40:04.135
Ed.

40:15.013 --> 40:17.549
EINSTEIN:
No, no

40:17.583 --> 40:21.186
it's P squared over N,
not N squared over P.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.722
ED:
She's not even here.

40:23.755 --> 40:28.894
EINSTEIN:
If she marries a genius,
she'll have genius children.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.662
Do something.

40:30.696 --> 40:34.566
I am doing something,
but it's not helpful.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.034
Or pleasant.

40:36.067 --> 40:39.170
CATHERINE:
A nuclear-powered spacecraft.

40:39.204 --> 40:41.640
Distinguished colleagues...

40:43.074 --> 40:44.843
honored guests...

40:44.876 --> 40:47.479
EINSTEIN:
Edward, just remember

40:47.513 --> 40:51.082
why you are doing this.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.992
Any journey in life...

41:01.026 --> 41:05.797
if not done for human reasons,
with understanding and love...

41:05.831 --> 41:07.666
This is not the paper we wrote.

41:07.699 --> 41:09.200
Shh! Listen.

41:09.234 --> 41:12.137
EDWARD:
... would be a very empty
and lonely one.

41:12.170 --> 41:13.238
And look.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.510
EDWARD:
Something worth remembering,

41:18.544 --> 41:22.514
since nuclear-powered spacecraft
may soon make the ancient dream

41:22.548 --> 41:27.919
of traveling to the edge
of the universe and back...

41:27.953 --> 41:29.655
a reality.

41:29.688 --> 41:34.560
The source of that power

41:34.593 --> 41:38.930
is the very source
that fuels the stars themselves

41:38.964 --> 41:40.298
and, in doing so

41:40.331 --> 41:45.904
fuels our imagination
and our dreams.

41:45.937 --> 41:48.039
Let us suppose

41:48.073 --> 41:51.910
that V of X
is the standard barrier

41:51.943 --> 41:54.179
of penetration potential

41:54.212 --> 42:00.151
and that size... and nuclear ...
function...

42:00.185 --> 42:06.958
then, as usual,
minus I-H-R-D sine D-T equals

42:06.992 --> 42:09.961
minus D squared

42:09.995 --> 42:13.799
psi D-X squared

42:13.832 --> 42:15.767
plus V of X.

42:19.871 --> 42:21.740
JAMES:
What a circus!

42:21.773 --> 42:24.209
As if the scientific analysis
wasn't mind-numbing enough

42:24.242 --> 42:26.678
what was all that mush
about the human heart?

42:26.712 --> 42:29.681
You didn't understand that
because you're not a physicist.

42:29.715 --> 42:31.116
Yeah, well, let's
remember, darling,

42:31.149 --> 42:32.818
neither was he
until recently.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.586
Did you notice he
still had grease

42:34.620 --> 42:35.787
under his fingernails?

42:35.821 --> 42:37.022
Edward, congratulations.

42:37.055 --> 42:38.223
To genius.

42:38.256 --> 42:40.125
To fusion.

42:40.158 --> 42:41.760
To the heart.

42:41.793 --> 42:43.094
Ah!
Ah!

42:43.128 --> 42:45.330
Ah, oh, so you never
went to college.

42:45.363 --> 42:47.165
I barely finished high school.

42:47.198 --> 42:49.300
I was always taking
apart some car.

42:49.334 --> 42:52.103
And yet, you have
such an amazing grasp of theory.

42:52.137 --> 42:55.106
Do you know, I believe that
you used Debrawley's formula

42:55.140 --> 42:56.975
for the length
of the pilot wave.

42:57.008 --> 42:58.043
Of course he did.

42:58.076 --> 43:00.245
It was a brilliant stroke.

43:00.278 --> 43:01.847
I couldn't have done
without it.

43:01.880 --> 43:03.949
Oh! I forgot that.

43:03.982 --> 43:05.083
Wait a minute.

43:05.116 --> 43:06.852
Could you, could you remind me?

43:06.885 --> 43:08.086
Um...

43:08.119 --> 43:10.355
Yeah. Um, sure.

43:10.388 --> 43:12.090
Uh...

43:12.123 --> 43:14.159
X

43:14.192 --> 43:15.226
equals...

43:16.294 --> 43:17.696
one

43:17.729 --> 43:18.897
plus, uh...

43:20.031 --> 43:21.032
W...

43:22.801 --> 43:25.971
X equals one
plus W

43:26.004 --> 43:26.905
cubed...

43:30.041 --> 43:32.644
in...

43:32.678 --> 43:34.112
over pi.

43:34.145 --> 43:36.815
CATHERINE:
Right, right.

43:36.848 --> 43:37.849
Can you invert that?

43:39.785 --> 43:41.019
MAN:
Where is he?!

43:41.052 --> 43:42.954
Where is that beautiful boy?

43:42.988 --> 43:44.122
Rocket ships.

43:44.155 --> 43:46.157
Zoom!
Zoom!

43:46.191 --> 43:48.226
Home run, Catherine, home run!

43:48.259 --> 43:49.661
Thank you, sir.

43:49.695 --> 43:52.097
Ed Walters, may I present
Louis Bamberger?

43:52.130 --> 43:55.667
If you had a nickel
for every nickel he has,

43:55.701 --> 43:58.169
you would have
a lot of nickels.

43:58.203 --> 44:01.773
An honor and a pleasure, sir.

44:01.807 --> 44:03.241
New Jersey--

44:03.274 --> 44:05.811
leader in intergalactic
rocket exploration.

44:05.844 --> 44:08.046
How does that sound
for a license plate?

44:08.079 --> 44:09.414
Long.

44:09.447 --> 44:10.849
Huh? Oh...

44:10.882 --> 44:12.083
sense of humor.

44:12.117 --> 44:13.819
I love this boy.

44:13.852 --> 44:17.022
May I steal my niece
for one minute, please?

44:17.055 --> 44:19.090
Uh, well, actually,
we were just about to leave.

44:19.124 --> 44:21.226
Just for one moment, please.

44:21.259 --> 44:22.460
I need some air.

44:22.493 --> 44:25.463
James, how is
the rat business?

44:25.496 --> 44:27.232
Um, well, it's
really students

44:27.265 --> 44:29.100
that I'm experimenting on now.

44:29.134 --> 44:31.302
My god, the mazes
must be enormous.

44:34.272 --> 44:36.241
Green, black, red.

44:36.274 --> 44:37.475
Look at that.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.244
It's like having
four pens in one.

44:39.277 --> 44:40.345
( laughs )

44:40.378 --> 44:42.748
What an exciting time
to be alive.

44:42.781 --> 44:44.950
MAN:
Louis, we need
to have a talk.

44:44.983 --> 44:47.052
This is going to be something
I understand, isn't it?

44:47.085 --> 44:48.286
Yeah, yeah.

44:48.319 --> 44:49.855
I don't understand
what you say to me.

44:49.888 --> 44:51.456
Yes, but you see...

44:54.993 --> 44:56.962
Oh, that's better.

44:56.995 --> 44:59.030
Look, Catherine.

44:59.064 --> 45:03.068
Look at the stars,
look at the sky

45:03.101 --> 45:04.135
look at...

45:04.169 --> 45:05.904
Edward.

45:05.937 --> 45:09.307
We were just talking
about the stars.

45:09.340 --> 45:11.442
Ah... well,
enough breathing.

45:11.476 --> 45:13.011
Wow.

45:14.813 --> 45:16.381
What a night.

45:16.414 --> 45:18.984
I haven't seen a sky like
this since I was a kid.

45:19.017 --> 45:21.252
That's stargazers' field.

45:21.286 --> 45:23.321
How many stars
do you think are up there?

45:23.354 --> 45:24.522
Hmm.

45:24.555 --> 45:27.258
Um, ten to the
twelfth, plus one.

45:27.292 --> 45:29.394
Ah, you don't have
to say that.

45:29.427 --> 45:31.830
No, really, everybody
is quite impressed.

45:36.301 --> 45:38.136
Do you know why
a comet's tail

45:38.169 --> 45:40.005
always points away
from the sun?

45:40.038 --> 45:41.106
Yes.

45:42.573 --> 45:43.975
Me, too.

45:45.443 --> 45:47.412
My grandma used
to tell me that

45:47.445 --> 45:51.182
stars are where a woodpecker
pecked holes in the sky.

45:51.216 --> 45:53.919
She wasn't that
scientifically minded.

45:53.952 --> 45:55.921
When my father
looked at the sky

45:55.954 --> 45:57.923
he didn't really see stars.

45:57.956 --> 45:59.557
He said he saw

45:59.590 --> 46:03.561
great seas of fire
and nuclear furnaces.

46:03.594 --> 46:06.431
He said it was like
a very violent ballet

46:06.464 --> 46:09.134
only it was too small
for anyone to see.

46:12.938 --> 46:15.273
What is keeping James?

46:15.306 --> 46:16.875
I don't know.

46:16.908 --> 46:19.144
He discovered a comet.

46:19.177 --> 46:20.411
James discovered a...?

46:20.445 --> 46:21.880
No. My father.

46:21.913 --> 46:23.882
They named it after him.

46:23.915 --> 46:25.150
Boyd's comet.

46:25.183 --> 46:26.151
Mm-hmm.

46:26.184 --> 46:27.418
Oh, my god, that's you.

46:27.452 --> 46:28.887
That's your father.

46:28.920 --> 46:30.155
Mm-hmm.

46:30.188 --> 46:32.290
I-I was just reading
about that in the...

46:32.323 --> 46:34.159
Oh, you've read his works?

46:34.192 --> 46:35.426
Well, some of them.

46:35.460 --> 46:36.561
There are so many.

46:36.594 --> 46:38.029
Three.

46:38.063 --> 46:39.564
Three? Really?

46:39.597 --> 46:41.566
There...
it seemed like more.

46:41.599 --> 46:43.534
They're all
so action-packed.

46:48.339 --> 46:50.241
PODOLSKY:
Action-packed?

46:50.275 --> 46:52.010
What is he saying?

46:53.344 --> 46:55.180
He's coming back.

46:55.213 --> 46:56.181
James?

46:56.214 --> 46:58.449
No. Uh, my father.

46:58.483 --> 47:00.318
You know,
just before he died

47:00.351 --> 47:02.587
he promised
that when the comet came back

47:02.620 --> 47:04.322
he'd be riding on it.

47:04.355 --> 47:06.191
Right, uh....

47:06.224 --> 47:08.927
right there.

47:08.960 --> 47:12.297
I think it's there,
just below Cassiopeia.

47:14.032 --> 47:15.366
Ah, you're right.

47:16.902 --> 47:19.404
He said he'd be riding on it

47:19.437 --> 47:22.140
looking down
to make sure I was okay.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.408
So, how are you?

47:23.441 --> 47:24.876
Are you okay?

47:24.910 --> 47:26.544
JAMES:
Catherine?

47:26.577 --> 47:29.014
Catherine!

47:29.047 --> 47:30.882
The rat man cometh.

47:30.916 --> 47:31.950
I...

47:31.983 --> 47:33.518
Catherine?

47:33.551 --> 47:34.986
( gasping )

47:35.020 --> 47:36.554
Somebody call a doctor.

47:36.587 --> 47:38.356
Albert, say
something.

47:38.389 --> 47:39.624
I just had

47:39.657 --> 47:42.293
too many knerdlers
for lunch.

47:42.327 --> 47:44.029
I need my pills.

47:44.062 --> 47:46.031
Catherine, you know
where they are?

47:46.064 --> 47:47.298
At home.

47:47.332 --> 47:48.866
Edward, you drive me.

47:50.335 --> 47:52.437
Yes, all right,
you-you drive him home.

47:52.470 --> 47:54.439
I'll collect your
things, Catherine,

47:54.472 --> 47:57.008
and I'll see you at
the Cafe Day Cup later.

47:57.042 --> 47:58.009
Yes. Yes.

47:58.043 --> 48:00.145
JAMES:
Yes?

48:00.178 --> 48:03.581
Albert, you want us
to come with you?

48:03.614 --> 48:05.050
No, no.

48:05.083 --> 48:06.317
Watch out.

48:06.351 --> 48:08.153
Good-bye, please.

48:08.186 --> 48:09.988
Let's go.
Let's go.

48:14.459 --> 48:15.426
Wait a minute.

48:15.460 --> 48:17.695
How do we get home?

48:17.728 --> 48:19.297
Good question.

48:19.330 --> 48:20.565
Oh...

48:20.598 --> 48:22.700
it's a lovely night.

48:22.733 --> 48:24.435
We walk.

48:24.469 --> 48:27.605
( thunder rumbling )

48:35.580 --> 48:39.050
Oh, look,
I found my pills.

48:39.084 --> 48:44.589
Now... maybe we can catch
some of this in a glass.

48:44.622 --> 48:46.591
Should get you
out of this.

48:46.624 --> 48:48.726
Yeah, that's a good idea.

48:48.759 --> 48:50.361
Over there.

48:50.395 --> 48:52.563
That cafe, Edward.

48:57.402 --> 49:03.041
( all laughing )

49:03.074 --> 49:06.711
It's a very bad
Albert Einstein joke.

49:06.744 --> 49:08.513
Maleva was his first wife.

49:08.546 --> 49:10.048
She divorced him.

49:10.081 --> 49:12.583
Yeah, I lived too much here
and not enough here.

49:12.617 --> 49:13.684
She have children?

49:13.718 --> 49:14.652
Two boys.

49:14.685 --> 49:16.121
Hans Albert.

49:16.154 --> 49:19.657
His mother named him
while I was out of town.

49:19.690 --> 49:21.259
And Edward.

49:21.292 --> 49:22.660
Yes?

49:22.693 --> 49:25.596
No. Edward was the name
of the other boy.

49:25.630 --> 49:28.666
Oh.

49:28.699 --> 49:32.270
Well, you must have lived
here at least twice.

49:32.303 --> 49:34.339
Edward...

49:34.372 --> 49:39.110
how did you first think
of atomic fuel?

49:39.144 --> 49:42.380
Well, it just
sort of hit me.

49:42.413 --> 49:43.281
Boom.

49:43.314 --> 49:44.449
Boom.
Boom.

49:44.482 --> 49:48.386
Was it a Kessler boom
or an accident?

49:48.419 --> 49:51.289
Because Kessler believes
that accidental discoveries

49:51.322 --> 49:52.623
are not accidents at all.

49:52.657 --> 49:55.626
That people have moments
of insight and intuition

49:55.660 --> 49:58.196
that they're prepared for
by their experience

49:58.229 --> 50:00.298
to recognize them
for what they are.

50:01.766 --> 50:03.334
Babbling.

50:03.368 --> 50:04.802
Babbling?

50:04.835 --> 50:07.338
No, you're not babbling.

50:07.372 --> 50:11.676
If I had a mind like yours,
I wouldn't stop talking.

50:11.709 --> 50:15.546
( thunder rumbling )

50:15.580 --> 50:17.515
I think it's letting up.

50:25.456 --> 50:27.425
I think she wants to leave.

50:27.458 --> 50:30.295
She doesn't know what she wants.

50:32.330 --> 50:33.531
( sighs )

50:44.742 --> 50:46.544
Still raining.

50:46.577 --> 50:48.546
Still raining.

50:53.884 --> 50:56.821
( playing waltz )

51:26.617 --> 51:31.422
I think your uncle wants us...
to dance.

51:31.456 --> 51:33.391
Oh, now,

51:33.424 --> 51:34.892
don't be irrelevant, Ed.

51:34.925 --> 51:37.228
You can't get
from there to here.

51:37.262 --> 51:38.496
Why not?

51:38.529 --> 51:39.764
Now, don't tell me

51:39.797 --> 51:42.500
that a famous
and brilliant scientist

51:42.533 --> 51:43.868
such as yourself

51:43.901 --> 51:45.870
doesn't know
about Zeno's paradox.

51:47.605 --> 51:48.873
Remind me.

51:48.906 --> 51:50.641
You can't get
from there to here

51:50.675 --> 51:53.478
because you always have to cover
half the remaining distance.

51:53.511 --> 51:55.413
Like, from me to you,
I have to cover

51:55.446 --> 51:56.681
half of it.

51:56.714 --> 51:58.149
But, see?

51:58.183 --> 52:00.385
I still have half
of that remaining, so...

52:00.418 --> 52:02.687
I cover half that
and, um... there's still

52:02.720 --> 52:03.788
half of that left

52:03.821 --> 52:05.823
so I cover half of that

52:05.856 --> 52:09.227
and, uh... half of that

52:09.260 --> 52:12.230
and half of that
and half of that.

52:12.263 --> 52:14.799
And since there are
infinite halves left...

52:16.834 --> 52:18.903
can't ever get there.

52:31.582 --> 52:33.518
So how did that happen?

52:35.986 --> 52:37.388
I don't know.

52:38.856 --> 52:40.725
It's not possible.

53:01.946 --> 53:03.448
( gasping )

53:03.481 --> 53:04.449
James.

53:04.482 --> 53:05.583
No. Ed.

53:05.616 --> 53:08.319
James. I was supposed
to meet him.

53:08.353 --> 53:10.288
Oh, oh.

53:17.395 --> 53:20.231
Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

53:21.766 --> 53:23.701
Shall we go again?

53:28.573 --> 53:32.277
So we have particle
"C"-- Catherine--

53:32.310 --> 53:36.547
in orbit around
particle "J"-- James--

53:36.581 --> 53:40.551
powerize particle
"E"-- Edward--

53:40.585 --> 53:44.889
follows "C",
becomes a new entity.

53:44.922 --> 53:47.592
"C" plus "E"

53:47.625 --> 53:50.528
which causes "J"
to disintegrate.

53:53.331 --> 53:55.966
* If I could take you up
in paradise above *

53:56.000 --> 53:59.304
* If you would tell me
I'm the only one that you love *

53:59.337 --> 54:01.572
* Life could be a dream,
sweetheart. *

54:01.606 --> 54:05.476
"Edward Walters,
a local garage mechanic

54:05.510 --> 54:09.314
"and amateur physicist
dropped a bombshell

54:09.347 --> 54:11.616
"on the international
physics symposium

54:11.649 --> 54:12.983
"with the announcement

54:13.017 --> 54:16.053
"of a formula that makes
interplanetary travel

54:16.086 --> 54:19.457
by nu-cu-lear rocket
a real possibility."

54:19.490 --> 54:21.459
Nuclear.

54:21.492 --> 54:23.461
I said nu-cu-lear,
professor.

54:23.494 --> 54:24.462
Nuclear.

54:24.495 --> 54:25.596
Good picture.

54:25.630 --> 54:27.598
This has got to be
the dumbest thing

54:27.632 --> 54:29.734
anybody ever did
to impress a dame.

54:29.767 --> 54:32.303
Especially one that expects you
to talk to her-- she's smart.

54:32.337 --> 54:33.471
Shut up, Frankie.

54:33.504 --> 54:35.606
Eddie, you hardly finished
high school.

54:35.640 --> 54:37.842
How do you expect
to get away with this?

54:39.910 --> 54:41.879
I know a lot
about science.

54:41.912 --> 54:43.448
Excuse me.

54:43.481 --> 54:44.482
Ed Walters?

54:44.515 --> 54:45.883
BOB:
Who the hell are you?

54:45.916 --> 54:47.385
Bill Reilly, Times.

54:47.418 --> 54:48.386
Yeah?

54:48.419 --> 54:49.387
Hey, hi.

54:49.420 --> 54:50.588
Bob Rosetti.

54:50.621 --> 54:51.556
I own the place.

54:51.589 --> 54:52.890
Oh, hey, Mr. Rosetti.

54:52.923 --> 54:55.693
So were you surprised
to find out you had such

54:55.726 --> 54:56.827
a brilliant
employee?

54:56.861 --> 54:58.429
ROSETTI:
Surprised?

54:58.463 --> 54:59.964
Why do you think
I hired him?
He's a genius.

54:59.997 --> 55:02.032
Hey, Ed, a lot of folks
are wondering

55:02.066 --> 55:04.735
how an ordinary guy like
yourself could come up

55:04.769 --> 55:06.504
with such
advanced ideas.

55:06.537 --> 55:07.572
JAMES:
I think I can
answer that.

55:07.605 --> 55:08.839
Hello, Edward.

55:08.873 --> 55:09.840
Congratulations.

55:09.874 --> 55:11.108
Thank you.

55:11.141 --> 55:13.911
You see, the fact is
that we're only now

55:13.944 --> 55:15.580
just beginning
to understand

55:15.613 --> 55:17.114
the true nature
of intelligence.

55:17.147 --> 55:18.115
And you are?

55:18.148 --> 55:19.584
James Morland.

55:19.617 --> 55:20.718
With the, uh...?

55:20.751 --> 55:21.986
Silas Paine
Institute.

55:22.019 --> 55:24.689
Experimental
psychology.

55:24.722 --> 55:27.858
We're learning that, uh,
that thing that we call genius

55:27.892 --> 55:31.128
that is the ability to make
intuitive breakthroughs

55:31.161 --> 55:33.063
can flower almost anywhere.

55:33.097 --> 55:35.866
Isn't that so, Edward?

55:35.900 --> 55:37.535
You're the expert.

55:37.568 --> 55:38.803
Yes. Yes, I am.

55:38.836 --> 55:40.571
That's really why I'm here.

55:40.605 --> 55:42.473
Oh, apart from to pick up
my car, of course,

55:42.507 --> 55:44.141
which I trust
is ready by now.

55:44.174 --> 55:46.110
We'd like to study you.

55:46.143 --> 55:47.845
Study me?

55:47.878 --> 55:49.780
Your brain.
Your thinking processes.

55:49.814 --> 55:51.716
It's an extraordinary
opportunity

55:51.749 --> 55:54.151
to increase our
understanding of
human knowledge.

55:54.184 --> 55:55.620
What do you say?

55:55.653 --> 55:56.887
Can we count on you?

55:56.921 --> 55:58.723
One, uh, colleague
to another.

56:00.491 --> 56:03.661
Many of you may recognize
this test.

56:03.694 --> 56:06.497
It's a variation on the classic
P.C.& D. examination.

56:06.531 --> 56:08.566
Mr. Walters will have ten
minutes to complete the series.

56:08.599 --> 56:10.835
You will find the first problem
inside this box.

56:10.868 --> 56:12.036
Are you ready, Ed?

56:12.069 --> 56:13.738
Actually...
Start the clock, please.

57:33.518 --> 57:35.085
JAMES:
Yes, uh...

57:36.821 --> 57:38.122
Yes, quite, uh...

57:38.155 --> 57:40.057
Quite impressive.

57:40.090 --> 57:41.826
Uh, now we move on to phase two.

57:41.859 --> 57:43.661
Phase two?

57:43.694 --> 57:46.096
Yes, we've, uh, tested
the subject's motor ability.

57:46.130 --> 57:48.499
Now it's time to test
his general knowledge--

57:48.533 --> 57:49.934
something which,
I must confess

57:49.967 --> 57:52.503
I've been quite curious about--
and to that end

57:52.537 --> 57:55.205
I have devised a series
of multiple choice questions--

57:55.239 --> 57:56.974
50 in all--

57:57.007 --> 57:58.509
on relativity,
Newtonian physics

57:58.543 --> 57:59.910
physical chemistry

57:59.944 --> 58:02.179
and, of course,
some basic quantum mechanics.

58:02.212 --> 58:05.783
The subject has 18 minutes
in which to complete the series.

58:05.816 --> 58:06.917
Uh, lights, please.

58:06.951 --> 58:08.653
Would you like to sit down?

58:08.686 --> 58:09.754
And, uh, projector.

58:10.888 --> 58:13.223
Start the clock.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.298
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

58:21.331 --> 58:22.733
Excuse me.

58:22.767 --> 58:24.268
Excuse me.

58:38.115 --> 58:39.216
( clearing throat )

58:49.093 --> 58:50.227
( sneezes )

58:54.364 --> 58:55.566
( sneezes )

59:03.107 --> 59:04.308
( snorting )

59:07.311 --> 59:09.113
( belches )

59:14.218 --> 59:15.820
( grunts )

59:19.857 --> 59:21.926
( sneezes )

59:26.030 --> 59:27.331
( raspberry )

59:31.368 --> 59:34.071
( Einstein humming
"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik )

01:00:39.436 --> 01:00:40.771
Ow!

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.043
I'm done.

01:00:46.076 --> 01:00:47.244
That it?

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:57.755
In an intensive IQ Test today,
young auto mechanic Ed Walters

01:00:57.788 --> 01:01:01.826
scored 186, placing him in the
top point-zero-zero-zero...

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:02.860
Did he pass?

01:01:02.893 --> 01:01:03.861
That's our Eddie!

01:01:03.894 --> 01:01:05.262
Come on, mention the garage.

01:01:05.295 --> 01:01:06.363
Come on...
Bob and Al's...

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:07.898
Bob and Al's...

01:01:07.932 --> 01:01:09.900
At the White House,
President Eisenhower

01:01:09.934 --> 01:01:13.037
scoffed at the Soviet claims
to have leapt ahead

01:01:13.070 --> 01:01:14.371
in the race to space.

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:16.240
He dismissed the red rumors,

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:18.442
saying that the first man
in space

01:01:18.475 --> 01:01:21.746
will have hot dogs for lunch...
not borscht.

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:24.882
And the name of the man
who could put us there?

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:25.883
Ed Walters.

01:01:25.916 --> 01:01:27.084
I was wrong about him.

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:29.019
He's not an idiot savant at all.

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:30.220
He's the real thing--

01:01:30.254 --> 01:01:33.357
he's an idiot idiot.

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:34.859
Shh.

01:01:34.892 --> 01:01:36.426
The boy grease-pit genius.

01:01:36.460 --> 01:01:38.495
And like his mentor,
Albert Einstein,

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:40.030
young Ed Walters dreamed

01:01:40.064 --> 01:01:41.999
of solving
the mysteries of the universe.

01:01:42.032 --> 01:01:44.301
If you'd get the stars
out of your eyes

01:01:44.334 --> 01:01:45.970
you'd see for yourself.
James!

01:01:46.003 --> 01:01:48.438
Before long,
we'll all be going to the Moon

01:01:48.472 --> 01:01:51.108
for the weekend
on nuclear rocket engines

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:53.978
and save on our fuel bills
in the bargain.

01:01:54.011 --> 01:01:55.913
JAMES:
Have you actually read

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:58.749
this stupendous,
earth-shattering paper of his?

01:01:58.783 --> 01:01:59.850
No.

01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:01.285
You didn't?
I'm surprised.

01:02:01.318 --> 01:02:03.888
I thought you'd be dying
to get your hands on it.

01:02:03.921 --> 01:02:05.455
You know, as a fellow
mathematician.

01:02:05.489 --> 01:02:07.457
Mathematicians and physicists
everywhere

01:02:07.491 --> 01:02:09.860
are putting this startling
new theory...

01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:11.061
( gasps )

01:02:11.095 --> 01:02:12.529
It's me.

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.198
...to examine in detail
the mathematical brilliance

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:16.066
of this simple garage mechanic

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:19.136
who believes,
in the land of the free

01:02:19.169 --> 01:02:23.340
and the home of the brave,
nothing is impossible.

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:25.009
Do the horn again,
Edward.

01:02:25.042 --> 01:02:26.811
Ja, ja.

01:02:26.844 --> 01:02:29.279
( horn blowing
"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik" )

01:02:29.313 --> 01:02:32.082
Albert, we have
our convertible.

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:34.084
( laughter )

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:35.953
Good, good.

01:02:35.986 --> 01:02:40.224
This is like sailing,
without the wetness.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.960
Wonderful thing
you have made here, Edward.

01:02:42.993 --> 01:02:44.494
Why aren't you smiling?

01:02:44.528 --> 01:02:47.097
I think I've got to tell
Catherine the truth.

01:02:47.131 --> 01:02:48.565
No, no, it's too soon.

01:02:48.598 --> 01:02:51.501
She's falling in love
with the wrong guy, doc.

01:02:51.535 --> 01:02:54.004
Ja, but it's love.

01:02:54.038 --> 01:02:56.206
Edward, it's love.

01:03:09.586 --> 01:03:10.888
Catherine?

01:03:10.921 --> 01:03:12.389
No, thank you.

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:14.424
Ed.

01:03:14.458 --> 01:03:15.792
Hi.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:19.063
I was going
to ask you

01:03:19.096 --> 01:03:21.531
why you use
that operator there?

01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:26.303
I often ask myself
the same question.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:27.304
Oh.

01:03:27.337 --> 01:03:28.839
Yeah.

01:03:28.873 --> 01:03:31.208
It's just a stroke
of brilliance.

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:34.544
I'm just so close
to figuring it out.

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:35.545
Trouble ahead.

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:36.580
Mm-hmm.

01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:38.949
Maybe, maybe not.

01:03:38.983 --> 01:03:41.085
What if she finds
the flaw in our theory?

01:03:41.118 --> 01:03:43.153
Easy. We just undermine
her confidence.

01:03:43.187 --> 01:03:44.388
Well, we shouldn't do that.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:45.489
How?

01:03:45.522 --> 01:03:48.292
We'll be obscure
and obtuse.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:51.495
Maybe you're taking something
for granted.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:52.496
What if you

01:03:52.529 --> 01:03:54.131
question everything?

01:03:54.164 --> 01:03:55.432
Look at it

01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:59.003
from an entirely
different perspective.

01:03:59.036 --> 01:04:01.105
Question everything.

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:08.979
Uh-oh.

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.655
Uncle Albert...

01:04:18.688 --> 01:04:20.524
could this be right?

01:04:25.329 --> 01:04:26.530
What?

01:04:26.563 --> 01:04:28.432
I know that look. What did I do?

01:04:28.465 --> 01:04:31.969
I never saw it this way.

01:04:32.002 --> 01:04:34.538
Oh.

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:36.040
( sighs )

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:38.075
I don't know what
I was thinking.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.548
Excuse me.

01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:53.157
What did you say to her?

01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:05.435
Why do you let them
scare you off like that?

01:05:05.469 --> 01:05:07.571
They are the greatest
minds in the world.

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:09.673
So? Who says they have
all the answers?

01:05:09.706 --> 01:05:11.008
Wait. Who says what?

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.209
Who says you're not one

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:14.178
of the greatest minds
in the world?

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:15.412
Well, I'm not like you.

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:16.480
You're a natural.

01:05:16.513 --> 01:05:18.248
You're just like
one of them.

01:05:18.282 --> 01:05:19.616
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

01:05:19.649 --> 01:05:21.118
Yes, you are.
No, I'm not.

01:05:21.151 --> 01:05:22.252
Believe me, I'm not.

01:05:22.286 --> 01:05:24.254
Oh! Well, okay--
you're younger.

01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:25.689
The point is,

01:05:25.722 --> 01:05:28.058
you're not just some
dumb garage mechanic.

01:05:28.092 --> 01:05:29.593
You're a genius,
and I'm just...

01:05:29.626 --> 01:05:30.727
I don't know
what I am.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.196
What? What are you?

01:05:32.229 --> 01:05:33.197
A housewife?

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:36.300
( sighing ):
Almost.

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.668
I think you're more than that.

01:05:38.702 --> 01:05:43.240
( imitating Brando ):
Lady, the only thing
you're afraid of is yourself.

01:05:43.273 --> 01:05:45.242
Wait. Can I just
ask you something?

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:46.243
What?

01:05:46.276 --> 01:05:47.644
What, um...

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:49.346
Why do you do that?

01:05:49.379 --> 01:05:50.747
What?

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:52.349
Brando.

01:05:52.382 --> 01:05:55.385
I'm just trying
to make you smile.

01:05:55.419 --> 01:05:56.420
Oh.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:57.621
Well...

01:05:57.654 --> 01:05:59.189
( chuckling ):
Thanks.

01:05:59.223 --> 01:06:00.957
Bye.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:06.296
EINSTEIN:
It's for the best.

01:06:06.330 --> 01:06:08.098
We squeeze the brain a little

01:06:08.132 --> 01:06:09.633
to make room for the heart.

01:06:09.666 --> 01:06:11.401
But maybe accidents

01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:14.038
are part of the
grand design?

01:06:14.071 --> 01:06:16.240
If you cause
the accident

01:06:16.273 --> 01:06:18.375
then it is not
an accident.

01:06:18.408 --> 01:06:19.709
Ah, ja, ja.

01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:22.746
You know, the trouble
with accidents is

01:06:22.779 --> 01:06:25.382
you can't predict
the outcome.

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:27.184
Ah! So-So maybe Catherine

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:29.686
will fall in love
with one of us.

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:32.622
( laughing ):
You are such a dreamer,
lieblich.

01:06:42.799 --> 01:06:44.301
( hitting piano keys )

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:45.535
( gasping )

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:47.604
( gasping ):
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.

01:06:47.637 --> 01:06:49.173
Were you sleeping?

01:06:49.206 --> 01:06:50.407
Oh, Catherine, no.

01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:52.376
I was just in repose.

01:06:52.409 --> 01:06:53.377
Oh.

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:54.678
Where were you?

01:06:54.711 --> 01:06:56.246
Thinking.

01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.382
I was worried about you.

01:06:58.415 --> 01:07:00.317
That I was thinking?

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:01.718
Me, too.

01:07:01.751 --> 01:07:06.090
No, I was worried that
you were angry with me

01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:09.426
since it's the one thing
I would not be able to bear.

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:12.062
Please forgive
a foolish old man.

01:07:12.096 --> 01:07:13.230
Oh, no, no, no.

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:14.698
You weren't being...

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:16.500
Well, maybe a little.

01:07:16.533 --> 01:07:17.701
It was me.

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:20.337
He'll tell me
what to think.

01:07:20.370 --> 01:07:21.405
Who?

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:22.606
( gasping ):
My notebook!

01:07:22.639 --> 01:07:23.840
I thought I lost this.

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.442
Catherine, who?

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:30.447
My dad... the comet...
Friday, 10:35.

01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:33.117
Liebchen...

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:35.852
I know we make fun
of your James.

01:07:35.885 --> 01:07:39.823
We call him "the rat man"
and "the rodent king."

01:07:39.856 --> 01:07:41.858
And "the lesser professor"

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:44.461
and "the excremental
psychologist."

01:07:44.494 --> 01:07:46.863
Ja... and "sir monkey lips."

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.298
"Chimp pimp."

01:07:48.332 --> 01:07:50.134
This all stops now.

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:51.668
Hmm.

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:53.470
What I wish for you:

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:56.406
You go out and have
a good life.

01:07:56.440 --> 01:07:57.674
You mean that?

01:07:57.707 --> 01:07:59.176
( sighing )

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:01.345
I just spoke with him.

01:08:01.378 --> 01:08:03.213
Who?

01:08:03.247 --> 01:08:05.182
With the rat... with James.

01:08:05.215 --> 01:08:12.589
Tomorrow, we all go together,
and we have an excursion.

01:08:12.622 --> 01:08:13.623
( crashing )

01:08:13.657 --> 01:08:15.192
( man screaming )

01:08:15.225 --> 01:08:16.859
Hello? Someone lost in...

01:08:16.893 --> 01:08:17.861
Hello.

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:18.862
We heard screaming.

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:20.663
Screaming?
Ja, ja.

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:22.232
NATHAN:
We are looking for
professor Einstein.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:23.767
He said you would
be together.

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:25.169
Uh, yes, but not here.

01:08:25.202 --> 01:08:26.636
I'm going sailing with him.

01:08:26.670 --> 01:08:28.238
( screaming )

01:08:28.272 --> 01:08:29.706
Oh, sailing...
of course!

01:08:29.738 --> 01:08:31.508
We were...
we were mistaken.

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:32.542
We never go sailing.

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:34.411
Really?

01:08:34.444 --> 01:08:37.913
He says the fish don't want
to eat what we have just eaten.

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:39.515
( louder screaming )

01:08:39.549 --> 01:08:40.783
I'd better check on this.

01:08:40.817 --> 01:08:41.850
No, no! He's fine.

01:08:41.885 --> 01:08:43.587
Don't touch anything.

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:47.491
( animals yelping
and chattering )

01:08:47.524 --> 01:08:49.326
( chattering )

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.263
MAN:
Quiet!

01:08:53.296 --> 01:08:54.898
( imitating animal chatter )

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:57.367
This is what we miss
in physics: screaming.

01:08:57.401 --> 01:08:58.602
( chuckling )

01:08:58.635 --> 01:09:01.438
If anybody screams,
it's usually me.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:03.372
Uh, please, don't, don't

01:09:03.407 --> 01:09:04.573
touch anything.

01:09:05.875 --> 01:09:10.346
( animals chattering excitedly)

01:09:11.948 --> 01:09:13.483
( making kissing sounds )

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:17.220
You let the rats
run around like that, eh?

01:09:17.254 --> 01:09:18.587
Very democratic
of you.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:23.727
18 months
of experimental research gone!

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:26.196
Oh, the monkeys!

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:27.497
It's plain to see

01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:29.332
you're very busy.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:31.468
We come back
another time.

01:09:31.501 --> 01:09:34.537
* Hallelujah, hallelujah...

01:09:34.571 --> 01:09:36.439
Psychologists... So crazy!

01:09:36.473 --> 01:09:38.475
( laughs )
Go!

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:39.843
Well, I don't
understand it.

01:09:39.876 --> 01:09:41.978
He's always ten minutes
early for everything.

01:09:42.011 --> 01:09:43.846
Any longer, we
lose the wind.

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:45.649
Okay, that's it.
We're set.

01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:47.651
I'm very disappointed.

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:52.421
I was looking forward
to getting to know him better.

01:09:59.663 --> 01:10:02.532
Um...

01:10:02.566 --> 01:10:05.201
well, maybe next time.

01:10:19.483 --> 01:10:20.717
It's pretty.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:21.718
Mmm.

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:22.719
( yelling )

01:10:22.752 --> 01:10:23.720
Whoa.

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:24.754
Sorry.

01:10:24.788 --> 01:10:26.490
It's all right. You okay?

01:10:26.523 --> 01:10:27.791
Uncle Albert...

01:10:27.824 --> 01:10:28.892
cut it out!

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:30.460
Listen, Catherine,

01:10:30.494 --> 01:10:32.329
there's something
I have to tell you.

01:10:32.362 --> 01:10:33.497
No, listen, uh...

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:35.532
I know that Uncle Albert
and everybody

01:10:35.565 --> 01:10:36.900
wants us to... you know.

01:10:36.933 --> 01:10:38.602
But there's
something else...

01:10:38.635 --> 01:10:40.437
No. You have
to let me finish.

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:42.439
It's just that...

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:44.574
Well, love between

01:10:44.608 --> 01:10:45.809
two people, uh...

01:10:45.842 --> 01:10:47.311
Oh!

01:10:50.314 --> 01:10:51.448
Sorry.

01:10:51.481 --> 01:10:52.882
Uncle Albert!

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:55.385
I'm steering
the boat.

01:10:55.419 --> 01:10:57.621
Uh...

01:10:57.654 --> 01:10:59.456
Uh...

01:10:59.489 --> 01:11:00.590
Love...

01:11:00.624 --> 01:11:01.991
No.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:05.529
People who share common
goals and interests...

01:11:05.562 --> 01:11:08.298
Did you ever hear
of the color algae?

01:11:08.332 --> 01:11:09.299
No.

01:11:09.333 --> 01:11:10.700
Oh.

01:11:10.734 --> 01:11:12.736
Anyway, the point is, Ed,
that, um...

01:11:12.769 --> 01:11:15.004
you can't choose
who you're gonna love.

01:11:15.038 --> 01:11:16.340
Well, I know that.

01:11:16.373 --> 01:11:17.941
You know? It just happens.

01:11:17.974 --> 01:11:20.076
And I think you're
a decent person

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:21.478
and I respect you...

01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:22.746
I respect you, too.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:25.615
Thank you. And I know
how you feel about me.

01:11:25.649 --> 01:11:27.484
It's just that you can't...

01:11:27.517 --> 01:11:30.554
you can't expect somebody
who you've just met--

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:32.589
somebody who hardly
knows you--

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.057
to suddenly say...

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:38.595
I love you.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.330
I understand. That's okay.

01:11:40.364 --> 01:11:42.899
No, I love you.

01:11:42.932 --> 01:11:44.568
I do!

01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:46.970
I do! I said it!

01:11:47.003 --> 01:11:48.538
You love me?

01:11:48.572 --> 01:11:52.609
Yes! I love you.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:53.577
Whoa!

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:54.611
Would you stop?

01:11:54.644 --> 01:11:56.480
Uncle Albert,
would you please

01:11:56.513 --> 01:11:57.647
cut that out?

01:11:57.681 --> 01:12:00.517
I can do it myself now.

01:12:12.061 --> 01:12:14.664
Wahoo.

01:12:15.832 --> 01:12:17.634
Did you feel that?

01:12:17.667 --> 01:12:18.835
Ja!

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:21.571
Somewhere, an atom
collided with an atom

01:12:21.605 --> 01:12:23.973
that collided with
an atom, and so on

01:12:24.007 --> 01:12:25.742
until it collided
with us!

01:12:25.775 --> 01:12:27.010
( laughing )

01:12:27.043 --> 01:12:28.478
To atoms...

01:12:28.512 --> 01:12:31.581
those sexy
little kinkies.

01:12:33.450 --> 01:12:35.552
Suppose you think you're
in love with this...

01:12:35.585 --> 01:12:36.820
this mechanic, do you?

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:38.588
Yes! Ed!

01:12:38.622 --> 01:12:40.390
I'm in love with him!

01:12:40.424 --> 01:12:41.658
Let me explain...

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:42.659
( clanging )

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:43.660
Oh...

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:44.761
it's an infatuation.

01:12:44.794 --> 01:12:46.463
It's not love.

01:12:46.496 --> 01:12:49.866
He's pleasant-looking,
he's, he's popular...

01:12:49.899 --> 01:12:51.635
Uncle Albert likes him,

01:12:51.668 --> 01:12:55.004
so, naturally, you feel
attracted, but it...

01:12:55.038 --> 01:12:57.774
it won't last.

01:12:57.807 --> 01:13:00.677
What we have will last:

01:13:00.710 --> 01:13:03.179
Common aims
and interests...

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:05.014
verbal communications...

01:13:05.048 --> 01:13:07.817
financial security...

01:13:07.851 --> 01:13:10.654
intellectual compatibility.

01:13:10.687 --> 01:13:12.155
What about love?

01:13:15.158 --> 01:13:18.061
Sounds like a hundred-dollar
brake job, Frank.

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:20.196
Busted tappets. Ed?

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.865
Huh?

01:13:21.898 --> 01:13:23.733
What do you think?

01:13:25.869 --> 01:13:27.637
She loves me.

01:13:29.973 --> 01:13:31.741
I thought that was
the idea.

01:13:31.775 --> 01:13:33.076
You haven't told
her, have you?

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:34.778
I've been trying.

01:13:34.811 --> 01:13:36.546
Ah, tell 'em nothing,
that's what I say.

01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:37.947
It's not that hard.

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:40.083
You just call her up and say,

01:13:40.116 --> 01:13:42.952
"Hello. I'm a lying
grease monkey."

01:13:42.986 --> 01:13:45.088
Leave me alone, will you?

01:13:45.121 --> 01:13:47.657
It's going
to be all right.

01:13:47.691 --> 01:13:49.926
She loves me.

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:07.611
Will it work?

01:14:07.644 --> 01:14:10.880
Will it work?

01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:12.516
You never know.

01:14:12.549 --> 01:14:16.586
Hmm... I've seen
this before.

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:19.088
Well, yes, it's been
in all the papers:

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:20.857
Ed Walters' cold fusion.

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:23.493
No, no, I mean
years ago...

01:14:23.527 --> 01:14:24.661
somewhere.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:30.767
First I want to say,
"I lie you...

01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.736
"I-I love you.

01:14:32.769 --> 01:14:34.103
I'm a l... a liar."

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:45.281
There's been some things

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:48.017
that I haven't been
completely honest about,

01:14:48.051 --> 01:14:49.886
and, um, I would like the...

01:14:49.919 --> 01:14:51.054
( knocking )

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:52.922
Just a minute, Catherine.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.894
( soft waltz playing )

01:14:57.927 --> 01:14:58.895
Edward Walters?

01:14:58.928 --> 01:14:59.896
Yes?

01:14:59.929 --> 01:15:01.264
Hey!

01:15:01.297 --> 01:15:02.899
Quiet. Speak when
you're spoken to.

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:04.968
Act natural. Keep
the answers short.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:07.003
Edward... Edward,
I want you to meet

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.806
the President
of the United States.

01:15:09.839 --> 01:15:10.840
Ike?!

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:12.041
You're... you're...

01:15:12.075 --> 01:15:13.176
you're the...

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:15.111
You're President Eisenhower.

01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:17.547
Well, at least until
the next election.

01:15:17.581 --> 01:15:22.919
Um, some special...
occasion?

01:15:22.952 --> 01:15:25.021
Oh, um...

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:27.290
I'm expecting someone...

01:15:27.323 --> 01:15:29.926
um... a friend...

01:15:29.959 --> 01:15:31.127
Catherine.

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:32.128
Catherine Boyd?

01:15:32.161 --> 01:15:33.129
Yes.

01:15:33.162 --> 01:15:34.263
Albert Einstein's niece.

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:35.799
I have to tell her
something.

01:15:35.832 --> 01:15:36.833
Ah.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:39.235
Well, son,
about this engine...

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:42.672
Uh, when can we see
a working prototype?

01:15:42.706 --> 01:15:43.907
A-A prototype?

01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:45.675
The Russians
have announced

01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:47.644
that they'll have a working
model within the year.

01:15:47.677 --> 01:15:49.913
The President would like to make
an announcement

01:15:49.946 --> 01:15:50.980
we are building

01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:52.816
a prototype here
in New Jersey.

01:15:52.849 --> 01:15:54.183
EISENHOWER:
We have a press
conference tonight.

01:15:54.217 --> 01:15:55.985
BAMBERGER:
7:00 at the symposium.

01:15:56.019 --> 01:15:57.286
EISENHOWER:
I'd like to be
able to tell them

01:15:57.320 --> 01:15:59.022
we'll have something
ready by say, um...

01:15:59.055 --> 01:16:00.189
7:00?

01:16:07.831 --> 01:16:10.199
Then Eisenhower tells
everyone the good news!

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:11.668
There's good news?

01:16:11.701 --> 01:16:12.936
About the prototype!

01:16:12.969 --> 01:16:14.671
Does Edward know this?

01:16:14.704 --> 01:16:16.339
Sure! It was
practically his idea!

01:16:16.372 --> 01:16:17.707
Come on, let's go!

01:16:17.741 --> 01:16:20.844
They're waiting for us
out front!

01:16:20.877 --> 01:16:22.011
( groaning )

01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.182
Oh, my god.

01:16:28.885 --> 01:16:30.987
SECRET SERVICE MAN:
Excuse me.

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.355
Catherine Boyd?

01:16:32.388 --> 01:16:35.024
EISENHOWER:
I met your friend Edward.

01:16:35.058 --> 01:16:37.293
You must be very proud.

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:41.130
I have very strong
feelings about him.

01:16:44.868 --> 01:16:46.369
We should leave
the country!

01:16:46.402 --> 01:16:47.637
Don't panic!

01:16:47.671 --> 01:16:48.872
When should
we panic--

01:16:48.905 --> 01:16:50.707
when they shoot
us for treason?

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.408
They don't shoot you
for treason.

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:54.010
I think it's
electrocution.

01:16:59.749 --> 01:17:02.151
Ed. It's Ed!

01:17:02.185 --> 01:17:03.853
Where's
Catherine?!

01:17:03.887 --> 01:17:06.355
With Eisenhower!

01:17:12.962 --> 01:17:14.030
Back!

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:16.966
Stay back, sir!

01:17:36.986 --> 01:17:39.122
Catherine! Stop!

01:17:42.091 --> 01:17:43.359
Isn't that, uh...?
Walters!

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:44.360
Ed!

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:46.195
Catherine!

01:17:47.463 --> 01:17:48.932
Catherine! Stop!

01:17:48.965 --> 01:17:50.900
Congratulations,
young lady.

01:17:50.934 --> 01:17:52.201
I felt the same way

01:17:52.235 --> 01:17:53.970
when I proposed
to Mamie.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.805
Mr. President,
I think you'd better get...

01:17:55.839 --> 01:17:57.406
It's okay. Okay.
Stop the car.

01:18:06.249 --> 01:18:07.817
Isn't that
Ed Walters?

01:18:07.851 --> 01:18:08.852
Yeah, that's him.

01:18:08.885 --> 01:18:09.886
Some kind
of problem?

01:18:09.919 --> 01:18:11.855
Why'd we stop?

01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:19.963
Catherine...

01:18:19.996 --> 01:18:21.164
Don't talk to me,

01:18:21.197 --> 01:18:23.099
you liar, you fake,
you phony...

01:18:23.132 --> 01:18:24.400
You found out.

01:18:24.433 --> 01:18:26.202
How could you think
I was that stupid?

01:18:26.235 --> 01:18:27.737
I don't think
you're stupid.

01:18:27.771 --> 01:18:28.772
How'd you find out?

01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:29.773
I figured it out, okay?

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:30.907
I just figured it out.

01:18:30.940 --> 01:18:32.008
I put two and
two together--

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:33.409
V over R
equals H...

01:18:33.442 --> 01:18:35.144
The formula?
That's fantastic! That's great!

01:18:35.178 --> 01:18:37.446
Stop it! You fake...

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.848
Just kiss me.

01:18:38.882 --> 01:18:39.849
What?

01:18:39.883 --> 01:18:42.018
Be right there, Ike!

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.820
Take your time!

01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:45.088
The president thinks

01:18:45.121 --> 01:18:46.355
that you are
proposing to me,

01:18:46.389 --> 01:18:47.490
so just kiss me.

01:18:47.523 --> 01:18:49.392
We're in a lot
of trouble here.

01:18:51.895 --> 01:18:54.463
( all mumbling )

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:56.866
Looks like a yes to me.

01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:57.867
Yes, it does.

01:18:57.901 --> 01:18:58.868
( grunting )

01:18:58.902 --> 01:18:59.869
Ow!

01:18:59.903 --> 01:19:01.037
You... you mechanic.

01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:02.806
See? That's all
I am to you--

01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:04.140
just a mechanic, right?

01:19:04.173 --> 01:19:05.141
Yeah!

01:19:05.174 --> 01:19:06.242
Is your name really Ed?

01:19:06.275 --> 01:19:07.410
Yes, it's Ed.

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:08.878
Do you really work
at a garage?

01:19:08.912 --> 01:19:10.413
Yes, a garage where you
fell in love with me

01:19:10.446 --> 01:19:12.215
when you first saw me,
remember?

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:13.482
That's real. That's true.

01:19:13.516 --> 01:19:14.550
That hurts!

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:15.785
One second, Ike!

01:19:18.121 --> 01:19:19.088
Ow! Ow!

01:19:19.122 --> 01:19:21.390
Oh, for God's sake...

01:19:21.424 --> 01:19:22.391
Ow!

01:19:22.425 --> 01:19:25.795
Ow! Ow!

01:19:25.829 --> 01:19:26.796
You know what?

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:27.797
What?

01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:28.798
You had to know.

01:19:28.832 --> 01:19:30.233
Something in you
had to know.

01:19:30.266 --> 01:19:31.267
You're not dumb.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:32.435
Yes, I am!

01:19:32.468 --> 01:19:34.437
I think you wanted
to go along with it.

01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:35.805
As a matter of fact,
I think you needed to.

01:19:35.839 --> 01:19:37.506
In a way,
you should be thanking me.

01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.308
Thanking you?

01:19:39.342 --> 01:19:40.309
Ow!

01:19:40.343 --> 01:19:41.310
Geez...

01:19:41.344 --> 01:19:43.112
Be right there, Ike!

01:19:44.948 --> 01:19:46.249
You bit me!

01:19:46.282 --> 01:19:47.250
Aah!

01:19:47.283 --> 01:19:48.251
Sorry, Ed.

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:49.552
Sorry about that.

01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:51.921
Listen, Ed.

01:19:51.955 --> 01:19:53.256
You're right.

01:19:53.289 --> 01:19:55.458
I've learned quite a bit
from you, you know?

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:57.460
I have a...
I have a great brain

01:19:57.493 --> 01:19:58.895
and I should trust that.

01:19:58.928 --> 01:20:00.063
Yeah.

01:20:00.096 --> 01:20:01.898
And it's not about
what you do.

01:20:01.931 --> 01:20:03.199
It's about who you are.

01:20:03.232 --> 01:20:05.068
So, I've learned that
from you.

01:20:05.101 --> 01:20:06.035
So, thank you.

01:20:14.010 --> 01:20:15.044
Fake.

01:20:15.078 --> 01:20:17.580
Albert...
what's going on?

01:20:20.049 --> 01:20:22.485
Catherine has
just found out

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:26.089
that Edward is not
really a scientist.

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:27.223
He is simply

01:20:27.256 --> 01:20:28.858
an automobile mechanic.

01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:31.494
What the hell does
an automobile mechanic

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.162
know about cold fusion?

01:20:33.196 --> 01:20:35.231
Nothing. It's all a big lie.

01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:37.466
April Fool's?

01:20:39.568 --> 01:20:40.603
We meant no harm.

01:20:40.636 --> 01:20:42.305
Just foolish
old men...

01:20:42.338 --> 01:20:45.308
So I was right about
the cold fusion, wasn't I?

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:46.575
Catherine,
do you realize

01:20:46.609 --> 01:20:48.444
that you have
proven conclusively

01:20:48.477 --> 01:20:50.213
that my approach
is impossible?

01:20:50.246 --> 01:20:51.414
Conclusively.

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:54.150
I knew that,
but you said that...

01:20:54.183 --> 01:20:55.351
Ja. I meant that

01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:57.987
I could not prove it
or disprove it.

01:20:58.021 --> 01:21:00.356
Therefore, I could
not publish it.

01:21:00.389 --> 01:21:02.658
I did something
that you couldn't do?

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:05.261
Ja. It's, uh,
mathematics.

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:08.497
I was always terrible
at mathematics.

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:09.865
Professor...

01:21:13.702 --> 01:21:17.040
Ed Walters' atomic fuel theory.

01:21:17.073 --> 01:21:20.409
An unpublished paper
of Albert Einstein's

01:21:20.443 --> 01:21:23.112
written 30 years ago.

01:21:23.146 --> 01:21:25.414
Gentlemen, they are identical.

01:21:25.448 --> 01:21:29.485
In every respect, identical.

01:21:29.518 --> 01:21:31.587
Are you accusing Ed Walters
of plagiarism?

01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:33.322
( chuckles ):
Hardly.

01:21:33.356 --> 01:21:37.026
I'm accusing Ed Walters
and Professor Einstein

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:41.430
and his colleagues...
of, um...

01:21:41.464 --> 01:21:45.701
of outright fraud.

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.603
Cold fusion
is nothing more

01:21:47.636 --> 01:21:49.939
than a hoax.

01:21:49.973 --> 01:21:54.710
( audience clamoring )

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.712
If you will please bear with us

01:21:56.745 --> 01:22:00.049
Professor Einstein
has a statement to make.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:02.318
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:22:02.351 --> 01:22:08.157
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dr. James Morland is correct.

01:22:09.558 --> 01:22:10.459
Cold fusion

01:22:10.493 --> 01:22:11.627
is a hoax.

01:22:11.660 --> 01:22:13.429
A hoax

01:22:13.462 --> 01:22:15.698
so brilliant, so daring,
so secret

01:22:15.731 --> 01:22:19.002
not more than five people
on the planet Earth

01:22:19.035 --> 01:22:20.469
know about it.

01:22:20.503 --> 01:22:25.208
We called it
"Operation Red Cabbage."

01:22:25.241 --> 01:22:27.743
But now, we can reveal

01:22:27.776 --> 01:22:30.746
through the efforts
of my colleague, Miss Boyd

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:32.015
and Mr. Walters--

01:22:32.048 --> 01:22:34.250
two of the finest minds

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:39.555
it has ever been my privilege
to know--

01:22:39.588 --> 01:22:44.427
we have proven the Russian claim
to have leapt ahead

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.563
in the space race
with cold fusion

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:49.999
is nothing but hot air.

01:22:50.033 --> 01:22:52.101
( audience murmuring )

01:22:56.105 --> 01:22:57.373
Personally, I think

01:22:57.406 --> 01:23:02.245
any race of this nature--
arms or space--

01:23:02.278 --> 01:23:05.381
is complete foolishness.

01:23:05.414 --> 01:23:08.451
Thank you very much.

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:10.253
( audience clamoring )

01:23:12.788 --> 01:23:14.390
A master stroke, gentlemen.

01:23:14.423 --> 01:23:16.059
A triumph for the institute.

01:23:18.261 --> 01:23:21.130
Catherine, darling,
you must understand.

01:23:21.164 --> 01:23:23.432
I said what I said
in good faith.

01:23:23.466 --> 01:23:26.435
Uncle Albert, that's not going
to work this time.

01:23:26.469 --> 01:23:32.808
Unfortunately, Catherine,
this is the real thing.

01:23:32.841 --> 01:23:35.278
Please, I go
to the hospital.

01:23:43.452 --> 01:23:48.624
Boys, please,
it's just a little flutter.

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:50.693
Please, go out,
see the comet.

01:23:50.726 --> 01:23:53.429
Go get some girls.

01:23:53.462 --> 01:23:55.164
Should we get one
for you?

01:23:55.198 --> 01:23:57.200
Ja, a redhead.

01:23:57.233 --> 01:23:58.301
Stay, Edward.

01:23:58.334 --> 01:23:59.702
Good-bye, boys.

01:23:59.735 --> 01:24:01.104
Thanks for coming.

01:24:01.137 --> 01:24:04.540
I will see you all shortly.

01:24:04.573 --> 01:24:05.641
Up there.

01:24:07.610 --> 01:24:12.215
It will be okay
in no time.

01:24:12.248 --> 01:24:15.318
I thought you said
that time doesn't exist.

01:24:15.351 --> 01:24:16.585
He said nothing.

01:24:16.619 --> 01:24:19.755
You know,
I always imagined heaven

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:22.458
to be one enormous library.

01:24:22.491 --> 01:24:25.728
Only you can't take out
the books.

01:24:29.332 --> 01:24:31.567
Oh, I need something
from my trousers.

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.602
Oh, I'll get it.

01:24:33.636 --> 01:24:36.705
It's in the left-hand pocket.

01:24:36.739 --> 01:24:38.307
The left hand.

01:24:38.341 --> 01:24:39.842
No, the other left hand.

01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:42.145
CATHERINE:
What am I
looking for?

01:24:42.178 --> 01:24:43.212
Ja, that's it.

01:24:43.246 --> 01:24:44.747
You found it.
Thank you.

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:47.883
Bring it here, please.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:52.721
Ja, my compass.

01:24:52.755 --> 01:24:56.892
My memory is...

01:24:56.925 --> 01:25:06.235
of my father
when I was five years old.

01:25:06.269 --> 01:25:08.671
I think I was sick
in bed then, too.

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:12.375
He gave me this compass.

01:25:12.408 --> 01:25:19.782
When I first held it in my hand,
I was wonder-struck

01:25:19.815 --> 01:25:25.721
by what force,
invisible and unfelt

01:25:25.754 --> 01:25:28.591
could be holding the needle.

01:25:32.228 --> 01:25:35.798
Here, Edward, you take this

01:25:35.831 --> 01:25:38.567
so that you never lose
your way.

01:25:38.601 --> 01:25:41.504
And you keep your sense
of wonder.

01:25:43.872 --> 01:25:46.509
You both have good hearts.

01:25:49.445 --> 01:25:55.384
Don't let your brain
interfere with your heart.

01:26:10.733 --> 01:26:12.201
I'd really love
to talk, Ed.

01:26:12.235 --> 01:26:13.669
Listen, Catherine,

01:26:13.702 --> 01:26:16.205
I never meant for this
to get as crazy as it did.

01:26:16.239 --> 01:26:19.375
If I've hurt you
in any way

01:26:19.408 --> 01:26:20.809
I'm very sorry.

01:26:26.014 --> 01:26:27.950
For one brief
moment there

01:26:27.983 --> 01:26:29.985
I was actually
taken seriously

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:35.391
by some pretty...
extraordinary people.

01:26:35.424 --> 01:26:38.894
And that's never
happened to me before.

01:26:38.927 --> 01:26:41.730
It felt great.

01:26:41.764 --> 01:26:45.701
I just hope at some point
that you can

01:26:45.734 --> 01:26:48.571
truly believe how
extraordinary you are.

01:27:02.050 --> 01:27:03.586
I'll miss you.

01:27:11.394 --> 01:27:12.461
So what are you saying?

01:27:12.495 --> 01:27:13.629
If we hadn't interfered

01:27:13.662 --> 01:27:15.364
they would have
ended up together?

01:27:15.398 --> 01:27:16.765
Everything affects
everything.

01:27:16.799 --> 01:27:19.535
I believe everything
will turn out fine.

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:21.003
Why?

01:27:21.036 --> 01:27:23.639
Because I would rather be
an optimist and a fool

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:25.040
than a pessimist and right.

01:27:25.073 --> 01:27:26.475
We're all fools.

01:27:26.509 --> 01:27:28.644
We should have
taken the elevator.

01:27:28.677 --> 01:27:29.912
Boys, please.

01:27:29.945 --> 01:27:33.916
You're going to wake up
the nurses.

01:27:39.688 --> 01:27:41.290
23 degrees up.

01:27:41.324 --> 01:27:42.525
No, no, no.
24 degrees.

01:27:42.558 --> 01:27:43.526
It would be

01:27:43.559 --> 01:27:44.627
22 degrees down...

01:27:44.660 --> 01:27:47.530
( all chattering )

01:27:47.563 --> 01:27:48.764
Please, just do it.

01:27:48.797 --> 01:27:49.765
Why? Why?

01:27:49.798 --> 01:27:53.001
A dying man's wish.

01:27:53.035 --> 01:27:54.303
In time.

01:27:54.337 --> 01:27:57.506
But since time
doesn't exist...

01:27:57.540 --> 01:28:01.043
( laughs ):
What do you see?

01:28:01.076 --> 01:28:04.513
I see... I see the road
to the observatory.

01:28:04.547 --> 01:28:05.614
And, and?

01:28:05.648 --> 01:28:06.849
And Catherine.

01:28:06.882 --> 01:28:08.484
And?

01:28:08.517 --> 01:28:11.587
She is going
towards stargazers' field.

01:28:11.620 --> 01:28:13.088
Wait a minute.

01:28:13.121 --> 01:28:15.524
That's where Edward went.

01:28:15.558 --> 01:28:19.061
Boy, if ever there was a time
for an accident.

01:28:19.094 --> 01:28:23.666
Sometimes, accidents
need a little help.

01:28:23.699 --> 01:28:26.769
God does not play dice
with the universe

01:28:26.802 --> 01:28:27.836
but I will.

01:28:27.870 --> 01:28:29.405
What kind
of a thing is that?

01:28:29.438 --> 01:28:31.574
What is that?

01:28:31.607 --> 01:28:33.776
This is a transmitter.

01:28:33.809 --> 01:28:35.478
Watch.

01:28:39.582 --> 01:28:40.082
( loud bang )

01:28:41.717 --> 01:28:42.851
Wunderbar!

01:28:42.885 --> 01:28:44.487
Oh!

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:45.988
Great.

01:28:46.021 --> 01:28:47.723
Push it down.

01:28:47.756 --> 01:28:49.458
Push it down.

01:28:50.593 --> 01:28:53.028
Ah! No!

01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:55.030
I'm going to look at...

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:56.865
Please.

01:28:56.899 --> 01:28:59.868
( laughter )

01:28:59.902 --> 01:29:02.037
Enough! Enough already!

01:29:02.070 --> 01:29:03.906
I want her back in one piece.

01:29:03.939 --> 01:29:05.641
What's happening
now, Albert?

01:29:05.674 --> 01:29:07.410
EINSTEIN:
The motor has died.

01:29:07.443 --> 01:29:09.978
She's turning off the road
into stargazers' field.

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:12.147
( all chattering )

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:13.616
Let me see!

01:29:38.841 --> 01:29:41.777
Uh... it just happened.

01:29:41.810 --> 01:29:43.011
Just boom!

01:29:44.880 --> 01:29:46.682
Boom.

01:29:48.817 --> 01:29:50.919
Do you believe in accidents?

01:29:52.455 --> 01:29:53.822
No.

01:30:15.978 --> 01:30:19.815
Oh.

01:30:19.848 --> 01:30:21.550
This is so right.

01:30:21.584 --> 01:30:24.887
This is the way
I wanted to see it.

01:30:29.592 --> 01:30:33.061
Have you ever heard
of the Seven Sacred Pools?

01:30:33.095 --> 01:30:35.764
In Hawaii?

01:30:37.566 --> 01:30:39.201
Are you all right,
Albert?

01:30:39.234 --> 01:30:42.805
Ja, this is very
good for my heart.

01:30:42.838 --> 01:30:44.540
Oh, my god!

01:30:44.573 --> 01:30:45.774
Look!

01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:48.577
( gasps )

01:30:48.611 --> 01:30:49.612
Look!

01:30:49.645 --> 01:30:51.980
( laughing ):
Hi, Daddy.

01:30:52.014 --> 01:30:54.216
I missed you.

01:30:54.249 --> 01:30:55.718
This is Ed,

01:30:55.751 --> 01:30:57.620
the man I love.

01:31:01.056 --> 01:31:02.691
Out of this world.

01:31:08.731 --> 01:31:10.232
What's happening?

01:31:32.788 --> 01:31:35.023
Wahoo.

01:31:36.959 --> 01:31:38.661
Wahoo.
