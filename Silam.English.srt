1
00:00:39,708 --> 00:00:42,916
By the way, Dad,
do you remember my friend, Dito?

2
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,250
On my first day at school,

3
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:48,625
you said he'd be my best friend someday.

4
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:52,916
You were right. How did you know?

00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:56,291
ANGGA ADITYO
BORN 15 MAY 1972 - DIED 11 NOVEMBER 2012

6
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:02,833
Dad...

7
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,291
Mom is getting worse.

8
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:11,875
She always yells at me.

9
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:18,333
Whatever I do, it's always wrong.

10
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:29,583
I have to go home.

11
00:01:29,875 --> 00:01:32,625
I'll see you again tomorrow.

12
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:17,916
Where have you been?

13
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,625
Answer me!

14
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,166
I'm sorry, Mom.

15
00:03:29,958 --> 00:03:36,333
I went to Dad's grave.

16
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,166
You know you have to come
straight home after school.

17
00:03:39,333 --> 00:03:41,416
What were you doing at your dad's grave?

18
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,083
I'm the surviving parent.

19
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,083
I'm the one
who takes care of you. Not him.

20
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,041
Do I have to be dead
for you to listen to me?

21
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:57,250
Go take a shower
and come back here for dinner.

22
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,291
Yes, Mom.

23
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,083
Baskara!

24
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,500
Why are you still up?

25
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,333
Go to bed, now.

26
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:27,041
CILILITAN 01 PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

27
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:47,541
Kids, tomorrow we're going
on a field trip to the Maritime Museum.

28
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:51,833
But, ma'am, they say there's a room there
that has never been opened

29
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,791
since someone hanged herself in it.

30
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:56,416
And she haunts the museum
every night ever since.

31
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,625
Calm down, kids. Tomorrow we'll see...

32
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,583
I don't believe anybody
who says they can see ghosts.

33
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,791
I've never seen a ghost in my life.

34
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:12,625
Once you activate your sixth sense,
you might see ghosts, too.

35
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:15,625
I don't believe in ghosts.

36
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,416
Do you want to buy some snacks?

37
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:30,333
I don't know. How much money do you have?

38
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,708
I have 15,000.

39
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,291
Let's go.

40
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,708
Did you laugh at me?

41
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,625
Tell me you don't believe
what I said about ghosts.

42
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:46,250
You'd better watch your back tomorrow.

43
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,541
-Shut up!
-Shut up!

44
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,875
Let's go.

45
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,500
You stay.

46
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:56,916
Are you okay?

47
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,333
Did you get in a fight?

48
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,375
No, Mom. I was...

49
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:11,750
What should I do to punish you, Bas?

50
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,708
Don't you have any sympathy
for your own mother?

51
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:21,458
Your job at school is to study,
not train to be a fighter.

52
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,833
And you ripped your school uniform.

53
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:34,458
Do you think the shirt was free?

54
00:08:36,791 --> 00:08:39,166
Do you think money grows on trees

55
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,833
and you can waste it any way you want?

56
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,458
Bas.

57
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:49,666
Do you understand how hard I work

58
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,000
to pay for your tuition
and put food on the table?

59
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:57,875
I give up. I just can't take it anymore.

60
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:27,916
ANTON PRASETYO - MELATI STREET 5/R.22
MANGGARAI, JAKARTA 12850

61
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:10,000
I want you to protect my mother.

62
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,250
I'm going to find my Uncle Anton.

63
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,125
Dear Mom, I'm leaving.

64
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:31,458
I hope you'll be happier with me
out of the picture. I love you.

65
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:58,416
Now, kids, this is a model
of our famous tall ship Dewaruci.

66
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:05,541
This is the ship our Navy uses
for training the cadets.

67
00:11:05,708 --> 00:11:09,541
This ship has three mainmasts.

68
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:14,708
They're named
Arjuna, Yudhishthira and Bhima.

69
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:18,958
Now, let's move on to the next room.

70
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,791
It's awesome.

71
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,500
Bas?

72
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:34,375
Bas?

73
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,375
Bas?

74
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:53,541
This is the room I was talking about.

75
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:55,666
Now, prove to me
that you don't believe in ghosts.

76
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:58,875
-Get inside!
-Go!

77
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,375
-Open the door.
-Get in there!

78
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,125
Get in there!

79
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:07,541
Get in there!

80
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,958
-Close the door!
-You stink!

81
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,666
-Lock it!
-Open the door, please!

82
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,041
-Take that.
-How does it feel, huh?

83
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:20,375
-Get me out of here! Somebody, help!
-You said ghosts don't exist!

84
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,416
-Now you can talk to a ghost!
-Scaredy-cat.

85
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,541
Take that.

86
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:27,000
Help! Please unlock the door!
Please, open the door!

87
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,083
Help!

88
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:49,791
Please, open the door!

89
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:50,916
Help!

90
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:55,375
-Take that!
-Does she have long hair?

91
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,500
Help!

92
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,250
Shut up!

93
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,708
Why are you so noisy?

94
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,916
-I don't want to take the blame for this.
-Let's get out of here!

95
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,875
Excuse me, ma'am?

96
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,291
Ma'am?

97
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,583
Excuse me.

98
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,666
Excuse me.

99
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,000
Ma'am?

100
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,208
Ma'am?

101
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:10,291
Miss?

102
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:14,208
Miss?

103
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:19,666
Miss?

104
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,958
Can you believe it?

105
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:33,083
Vera thinks she can replace me.
I'm so pissed.

106
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,958
It was just a misunderstanding.

107
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:35,541
Dad, since I bumped my head,

108
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:38,875
I think now I can see...

109
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,958
FEEDER BUS
TRANSJAKARTA

110
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:24,875
Yes?

111
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,875
-Uncle Anton?
-Who are you?

112
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,291
I'm Baskara, Uncle Anton.

113
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,791
-You're Baskara, Angga's son?
-I am!

114
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,791
You're so big now.

115
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,625
Are you here alone?

116
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:52,958
Yeah, I'm...

117
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,791
Come inside. I want you to meet
Aunt Ami and my kids.

118
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:58,750
Come in. Don't be shy.

119
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,875
Come in.

120
00:22:04,625 --> 00:22:05,916
Honey!

121
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:44,166
Bas, come here.

122
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,000
Who is this?

123
00:22:46,166 --> 00:22:49,083
He's Angga's boy.

124
00:22:49,250 --> 00:22:50,791
Baskara?

125
00:22:50,958 --> 00:22:55,083
Oh, my God, you're Baskara.
You've grown up.

126
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,958
-How old are you?
-I'm ten years old.

127
00:22:58,125 --> 00:23:00,625
-Ten?
-The last time we saw you...

128
00:23:00,791 --> 00:23:02,458
-When was that?
-...you were just this big.

129
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,291
We haven't seen each other for years.

130
00:23:05,958 --> 00:23:08,541
It's been years.

131
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,750
Dinner is ready.

132
00:23:20,125 --> 00:23:23,416
Amel, Lia, let's eat.

133
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,625
Hi, I'm Baskara.

134
00:23:28,791 --> 00:23:31,750
-I'm Amel.
-And I'm Lia.

135
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:36,833
Amel!

136
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:40,583
Sit down, Baskara.

137
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:44,583
You're going to like it here.

138
00:23:57,458 --> 00:23:59,250
Thank you, Auntie.

139
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:03,583
Thanks, dear.

140
00:24:38,958 --> 00:24:44,875
Your daddy and I have decided
for this year's vacation...

141
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:48,083
we're going to go to...

142
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,375
Labuan Bajo!

143
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:52,791
-Yay!
-Yay!

144
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:47,500
Aunt Ami.

145
00:25:49,125 --> 00:25:53,791
Have you ever yelled at
Amel or Lia before?

146
00:25:53,958 --> 00:25:56,625
Of course I have.

147
00:25:56,791 --> 00:25:59,541
If they behave badly, I scold them.

148
00:25:59,708 --> 00:26:02,625
They should know
what they did was unacceptable.

149
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:09,083
You always seem to be in a good mood,
and you smile a lot.

150
00:26:09,291 --> 00:26:12,000
Unlike my mother.

151
00:26:12,166 --> 00:26:16,416
She's constantly in a bad mood.

152
00:26:18,791 --> 00:26:23,416
If your mom was in a bad mood,
she definitely had a reason.

153
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:26,000
I don't know.

154
00:26:26,166 --> 00:26:29,750
I didn't do anything wrong.

155
00:26:37,166 --> 00:26:43,083
Aunt Ami, you seem to love
Amel and Lia so much.

156
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:47,208
Unlike my mother.

157
00:26:47,458 --> 00:26:52,333
I think she doesn't love me anymore.

158
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:58,000
All mothers love their children.

159
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:05,291
I miss having fun with my mother.

160
00:27:08,041 --> 00:27:10,125
You can have fun here.

161
00:27:10,791 --> 00:27:12,541
Don't worry about anything.

162
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:15,083
-Okay?
-Baskara.

163
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:19,000
Are you sleepy?

164
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:22,125
Come with me. I'll show you to your room.

165
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,750
Come here.

166
00:27:31,875 --> 00:27:35,166
When I saw you earlier,
you reminded me of my father.

167
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:37,291
You look just like him.

168
00:27:37,458 --> 00:27:39,583
I have to apologize.

169
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:45,250
After the funeral,
I didn't get a chance to visit you.

170
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:50,416
But I'm glad you're here.

171
00:27:54,625 --> 00:28:01,041
This is your room.
Redecorate it the way you like.

172
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,708
Baskara.

173
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:35,375
I got you chocolate milk.

174
00:28:35,541 --> 00:28:37,375
-Careful, it's hot.
-Baskara.

175
00:28:37,541 --> 00:28:40,791
Aunt Ami's hot chocolate
is famously delicious.

176
00:28:42,791 --> 00:28:44,666
Thank you, Aunt Ami.

177
00:28:46,791 --> 00:28:48,666
Drink it.

178
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,416
Drink up.

179
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,958
You can stay here as long as you like.

180
00:28:58,125 --> 00:29:00,708
Thank you, Aunt Ami, Uncle Anton.

181
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:11,750
Bas, one more thing.

182
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:17,291
To switch off the light, simply do this.

183
00:29:18,166 --> 00:29:21,291
And if you want to turn it back on...

184
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:23,875
Good night.

185
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,958
-Don't...
-Leave...

186
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:38,250
-...your room...
-...at night.

187
00:32:41,458 --> 00:32:42,916
Why not?

188
00:32:43,041 --> 00:32:45,125
-Because...
-Daddy...

189
00:32:45,250 --> 00:32:46,916
-...says...
-...so.

190
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:46,666
Baskara!

191
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:49,500
-Where...
-Are...

192
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:50,708
...you going?

193
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:54,708
-Daddy...
-Told...

194
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,041
-...us...
-...not to...

195
00:34:56,125 --> 00:34:57,500
-...go...
-...downstairs.

196
00:37:41,166 --> 00:37:42,416
Good morning, Uncle.

197
00:38:08,541 --> 00:38:10,208
Good morning, Baskara.

198
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,791
Well, how do you like it here?

199
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,458
I like it, Uncle. I do.

200
00:38:32,416 --> 00:38:34,250
Breakfast is ready.

201
00:38:34,416 --> 00:38:36,541
Amel, Lia.

202
00:38:43,416 --> 00:38:45,250
Let's eat, Baskara.

203
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,666
Bas, have a seat.

204
00:39:08,125 --> 00:39:10,458
You're going to like it here.

205
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:51,000
Your daddy and I have decided
for this year's vacation...

206
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,500
we're going to go to...

207
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,000
Labuan Bajo!

208
00:39:57,208 --> 00:39:59,375
-Yay!
-Yay!

209
00:42:31,958 --> 00:42:33,583
Don't go there.

210
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:37,000
There's a...

211
00:42:37,166 --> 00:42:39,875
It's okay. I can see her.

212
00:42:41,708 --> 00:42:43,625
You can see her, too?

213
00:42:43,791 --> 00:42:46,500
Yes. And I know she won't hurt me.

214
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:55,666
-I'm Baskara.
-I'm Irina.

215
00:42:57,041 --> 00:42:59,708
Do you come here often?

216
00:42:59,875 --> 00:43:05,250
Yeah. I come here every Saturday.

217
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:10,791
I love the view
and the weather here is so nice.

218
00:43:16,541 --> 00:43:19,708
When did you realize you could see ghosts?

219
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:24,416
I've seen them ever since I can remember.

220
00:43:25,791 --> 00:43:31,875
I can see them since I bumped my head.

221
00:43:40,875 --> 00:43:43,958
Aren't you afraid to see them?

222
00:43:44,125 --> 00:43:46,291
I was, at first.

223
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:50,291
But after a while, I got used to it.

224
00:43:52,875 --> 00:43:56,958
And my grandma gave me this, too.

225
00:43:58,166 --> 00:43:59,791
What's that?

226
00:43:59,958 --> 00:44:02,708
This is an amulet.

227
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:07,833
She told me to throw it
at evil spirits who want to harm me.

228
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,250
Why do you keep singing that song?

229
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:35,875
I just like it.
My grandma taught it to me.

230
00:44:53,250 --> 00:44:57,333
I guess you can see
the ghosts haunting this house.

231
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:07,291
I often see the ghost of an old lady
who haunts the yard.

232
00:45:28,041 --> 00:45:29,250
Baskara...

233
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:33,541
meet my grandma.

234
00:45:35,458 --> 00:45:38,583
How dare you come into my house.

235
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,666
-Where...
-Have...

236
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:27,666
...you been?

237
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:30,750
I took a walk in the park.

238
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,916
Thigh.

239
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:56,583
Breast.

240
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:44,208
He's going to choke.

241
00:47:52,041 --> 00:47:58,208
Your daddy and I have decided
for this year's vacation...

242
00:47:58,666 --> 00:48:00,458
we're going to go to...

243
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:02,375
Labuan Bajo.

244
00:48:02,541 --> 00:48:04,125
Labuan Bajo!

245
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,750
-Yay!
-Yay!

246
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,375
Sit down.

247
00:48:36,166 --> 00:48:38,000
Take off shoes.

248
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:40,416
Take a book.

249
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:42,750
Read.

250
00:50:30,958 --> 00:50:35,083
I don't know who she is,
but she's not coming for us.

251
00:50:35,791 --> 00:50:41,583
It's up to her.
But we can't keep doing this.

252
00:53:21,875 --> 00:53:24,291
Uncle Anton!

253
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:28,500
Uncle Anton!

254
00:56:22,333 --> 00:56:24,250
Good morning, Baskara.

255
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:34,041
Uncle, every night

256
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:37,083
I'm attacked by--

257
00:56:37,250 --> 00:56:40,083
They're just dreams.

258
00:56:40,250 --> 00:56:43,083
Don't worry about it.

259
00:56:43,250 --> 00:56:49,333
Sometimes when you're tired,
you have nightmares.

260
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,458
Right?

261
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:57,708
But if what you mean is noises at night...

262
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:01,958
sometimes I hear them, too.

263
00:57:02,125 --> 00:57:05,875
It's okay. That's normal.

264
00:57:11,333 --> 00:57:16,083
Well, how do you like it here?

265
00:57:21,125 --> 00:57:22,875
Breakfast is ready!

266
00:57:35,791 --> 00:57:36,708
Irina.

267
00:57:38,041 --> 00:57:40,250
How many times do I have to tell you?

268
00:57:40,708 --> 00:57:43,833
Never leave home without this pouch.

269
00:58:08,166 --> 00:58:11,958
Irina! Irina!

270
00:58:12,125 --> 00:58:13,375
Irina!

271
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:16,666
Baskara? What's wrong?

272
00:58:17,166 --> 00:58:20,708
I couldn't sleep last night.

273
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:23,708
I was attacked by an evil spirit.

274
00:58:24,166 --> 00:58:27,791
Attacked? They usually don't harm you.

275
00:58:28,166 --> 00:58:30,000
This one is different.

276
00:58:30,166 --> 00:58:32,250
The other ghosts seem to be scared of her.

277
00:58:32,625 --> 00:58:36,208
I think you should go home.

278
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,708
My home? I'm...

279
00:58:42,875 --> 00:58:45,750
Don't worry. I'll go with you.

280
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:17,666
I'm the surviving parent.

281
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:20,000
I'm the one
who takes care of you. Not him.

282
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:23,708
Do I have to be dead
for you to listen to me?

283
00:59:24,041 --> 00:59:27,000
What should I do to punish you?

284
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:27,333
Grandma?

285
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:32,125
Irina.

286
01:01:33,541 --> 01:01:34,750
What's wrong?

287
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:37,333
It's Baskara.

288
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:38,958
What about him?

289
01:01:39,125 --> 01:01:43,916
He was attacked. He's in danger.
We should help him.

290
01:03:31,333 --> 01:03:32,583
Let's eat.

291
01:03:45,166 --> 01:03:48,208
Well, how do you like it here?

292
01:04:04,125 --> 01:04:07,291
That kid is in danger. He left the house.

293
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:09,791
I think he finally discovered

294
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:13,250
that his uncle and his family
are all dead.

295
01:04:13,375 --> 01:04:15,833
I think I know where he went.

296
01:04:23,958 --> 01:04:26,250
Baskara...

297
01:04:26,416 --> 01:04:28,041
Mom?

298
01:04:32,041 --> 01:04:33,291
Mom.

299
01:04:34,875 --> 01:04:36,958
I'm home, Mom.

300
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:41,666
Mom?

301
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:15,708
-Help!
-Shut up!

302
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:44,958
Baskara?

303
01:05:45,125 --> 01:05:48,916
I'm... I'm...

304
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:52,333
Yes, I know.

305
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:57,708
Who are you?

306
01:06:00,083 --> 01:06:02,583
What are you doing in my house?

307
01:06:06,125 --> 01:06:10,250
I know you did some kind of ritual...

308
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:13,708
to bring Baskara back.

309
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:16,000
You have to stop!

310
01:06:17,250 --> 01:06:21,083
Every time you do that,
you torture Baskara.

311
01:06:22,958 --> 01:06:25,708
But I want my Baskara back.

312
01:06:26,416 --> 01:06:30,083
You can't bring dead people back to life.

313
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:35,416
Mom. I'm here, Mom.

314
01:06:36,958 --> 01:06:38,333
Mom?

315
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:42,291
You should bury his body
as soon as possible.

316
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:45,000
His spirit can't move on.

317
01:06:46,416 --> 01:06:49,625
But I want him back.

318
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:54,000
I need to apologize to him.

319
01:06:54,166 --> 01:06:56,916
Cancel your deal with the devil.

320
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:04,500
I wish I could, but how?

321
01:07:05,041 --> 01:07:07,041
Just mean it when you say it.

322
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:16,666
I want to cancel my deal with the devil.

323
01:08:02,541 --> 01:08:03,750
Mom!

324
01:08:11,958 --> 01:08:13,000
Mom!

325
01:08:24,458 --> 01:08:25,708
Mom!

326
01:09:10,583 --> 01:09:11,500
Mom's gone.

327
01:09:14,875 --> 01:09:17,791
Mom? Mom?

328
01:10:27,166 --> 01:10:30,291
Leave her alone! Leave her body!

329
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:34,416
You have no claim to her body!

330
01:10:35,833 --> 01:10:40,291
The longer you're in her body,
the weaker your powers become.

331
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:46,791
I've been waiting for the right time
to finally capture you.

332
01:10:48,958 --> 01:10:53,083
This is the moment,
and I'm going to defeat you.

333
01:10:57,583 --> 01:11:00,291
Mom? Mom?

334
01:11:01,500 --> 01:11:06,416
Wake up, Mom. I love you so much.

335
01:11:49,375 --> 01:11:52,291
Irina, give me the pouch.

336
01:11:56,333 --> 01:11:57,833
Pour some in my hand.

337
01:12:14,416 --> 01:12:20,083
Leave her body and enter your new vessel.

338
01:12:45,875 --> 01:12:47,666
Irina, find me a rope!

339
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:50,083
-Do you know where you keep the rope?
-Yes.

340
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,916
Hurry. Start with the legs.

341
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:50,708
Ma'am, Baskara's here.

342
01:13:51,750 --> 01:13:55,708
He is? Where is he?

343
01:13:59,166 --> 01:14:01,791
He's right in front of you.

344
01:14:02,708 --> 01:14:04,333
He's standing on my left.

345
01:14:08,958 --> 01:14:13,625
Mom, I'm here.

346
01:14:13,791 --> 01:14:17,166
He said he's here.

347
01:14:19,416 --> 01:14:21,958
You don't have to apologize to me.

348
01:14:22,125 --> 01:14:24,458
You don't have to apologize to him.

349
01:14:25,916 --> 01:14:28,166
I love you.

350
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:33,916
I just came here to say goodbye.
