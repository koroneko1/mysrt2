 Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:20.223
Do you see Tun?

00:00:20.224 --> 00:00:21.342
Didn’t he tell you?

00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:22.891
He went out of town.

00:00:23.184 --> 00:00:24.803
He went to a beach in Aou’s hometown.

00:00:24.803 --> 00:00:28.066
It seemed like I was surrounded by many people.

00:00:28.284 --> 00:00:30.808
But in fact, I had no one in my life.

00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:32.166
So I always thought,

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:37.755
I wanted to wake up and see that someone was waiting for me.

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:40.137
Can you be that person for me?

00:00:41.152 --> 00:00:41.937
Sure.

00:00:47.722 --> 00:00:48.677
Pretty.

00:00:49.678 --> 00:00:51.581
Yes, it is pretty.

00:00:52.098 --> 00:00:54.098
And you’re being too obsessed with the poster.

00:00:56.051 --> 00:00:56.961
Hey.

00:00:57.771 --> 00:00:58.575
Here.

00:00:58.935 --> 00:01:00.339
I just finished the poster.

00:01:01.265 --> 00:01:02.189
What do you think?

00:01:02.951 --> 00:01:03.932
Damn!

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:05.369
Nice.

00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:08.145
Of course, it is.

00:01:08.309 --> 00:01:10.476
Tess designed it himself.

00:01:11.279 --> 00:01:13.279
I don’t want to compliment you two anymore.

00:01:13.382 --> 00:01:14.734
Show your love somewhere else.

00:01:15.115 --> 00:01:15.977
It stinks.

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:20.498
How is the film editing going?

00:01:20.798 --> 00:01:22.417
A lot better than I expected.

00:01:22.804 --> 00:01:25.495
The love scene got me biting my pillow.

00:01:26.028 --> 00:01:28.576
As if the screenwriters are so deep in love.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.874
Damn right!

00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:33.699
If you tell me to rewrite the script now, it’d be even deeper in love.

00:01:34.551 --> 00:01:35.645
Right, Tess?

00:01:36.621 --> 00:01:38.144
Right, my ass.

00:01:38.144 --> 00:01:40.531
Hey, the edit is almost done.

00:01:40.842 --> 00:01:42.556
Can you recommend any colorist to take on the job?

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:46.538
There’s just one person that comes to mind.

00:01:46.744 --> 00:01:47.529
Who?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.285
I bought you snacks.

00:03:11.762 --> 00:03:12.457
Um.

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.256
Wow!

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.795
This scene's color grading is excellent.

00:03:20.167 --> 00:03:21.277
Are you in love or something?

00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:23.931
Go away.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.905
Don’t distract me.

00:03:25.238 --> 00:03:26.690
I’m trying to focus.

00:03:26.871 --> 00:03:28.109
Don’t be so mean.

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.671
I bought us our favorite.

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:31.576
This.

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:33.968
Oh,

00:03:34.778 --> 00:03:36.064
I’m working.

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:37.600
Feed me.

00:03:39.435 --> 00:03:41.048
Aw!

00:03:41.382 --> 00:03:43.096
How cute!

00:03:43.301 --> 00:03:44.171
You mean me?

00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.706
The film you’re grading.

00:03:47.654 --> 00:03:50.774
You can’t sleep at night if you don’t get to bug me, can you?

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:53.688
I’m kidding.

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:58.848
You’re actually cuter than the colors you’re grading.

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.581
When will I get to eat?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.822
I’ve been waiting.

00:04:17.777 --> 00:04:19.015
I want a big bite.

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.927
Hey!

00:04:25.273 --> 00:04:27.273
What are you doing, Tun?

00:04:27.594 --> 00:04:29.022
Feeding you a snack.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.870
Feeding, my foot!

00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:32.312
You’re messing it up.

00:04:35.436 --> 00:04:37.102
Wait. What are you looking for?

00:04:37.645 --> 00:04:39.002
A napkin.

00:04:39.516 --> 00:04:40.539
No need.

00:04:51.829 --> 00:04:53.257
Softer than the one from the package.

00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:00.792
You’ve got something there too.

00:05:01.983 --> 00:05:02.993
I’ve got what?

00:05:03.498 --> 00:05:05.117
- Come here.
- I’ve got nothing.

00:05:05.665 --> 00:05:06.634
I have now.

00:05:09.088 --> 00:05:10.119
That’s my boy.

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:12.942
He’s been here for a long time.

00:05:13.243 --> 00:05:15.243
No one has shown an interest in adopting him yet?

00:05:15.732 --> 00:05:16.470
No.

00:05:16.947 --> 00:05:18.209
No one has.

00:05:22.327 --> 00:05:23.214
How are you?

00:05:23.214 --> 00:05:24.327
Did you miss me?

00:05:27.716 --> 00:05:28.666
I’ll leave you two be.

00:05:28.666 --> 00:05:29.549
Be right back.

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:30.466
Sure.

00:05:37.765 --> 00:05:40.956
We’ve been here many times but don’t know what to call him.

00:05:41.573 --> 00:05:42.608
Should we…

00:05:43.394 --> 00:05:44.812
name him?

00:05:46.608 --> 00:05:47.869
We better not.

00:05:48.241 --> 00:05:49.598
Or we might get attached to him.

00:05:50.946 --> 00:05:52.708
Come on. Just for fun.

00:05:53.628 --> 00:05:55.866
He looks a bit silly.

00:05:55.866 --> 00:05:56.800
Should we call him Aou?

00:05:57.822 --> 00:05:58.940
Bastard.

00:05:59.765 --> 00:06:02.051
I think Fuse suits him better.

00:06:02.051 --> 00:06:06.465
Nah! It sounds too handsome, rich, and charming for him.

00:06:06.465 --> 00:06:07.310
What a confidence.

00:06:08.793 --> 00:06:10.793
We found him on the street.

00:06:10.793 --> 00:06:11.802
How about “On the Way?”

00:06:11.802 --> 00:06:13.290
On the Way isn’t a name.

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:13.790
Street?

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.855
Too blunt.

00:06:15.855 --> 00:06:17.877
God Save?

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:20.925
He’s not saved by God. He’s saved by you.

00:06:20.925 --> 00:06:22.544
That’s true.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:27.416
Lucky.

00:06:27.416 --> 00:06:28.153
My name is Fuse.

00:06:28.153 --> 00:06:29.744
I mean his name, not yours.

00:06:32.584 --> 00:06:34.084
Why Lucky though?

00:06:35.624 --> 00:06:36.790
Look at him.

00:06:37.091 --> 00:06:39.377
He got hit by a car, all covered in blood.

00:06:39.377 --> 00:06:40.392
But he managed to survive.

00:06:41.092 --> 00:06:43.735
I think the name fits him.

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.980
Damn it!

00:06:47.853 --> 00:06:49.567
Did I just name him?

00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:50.315
Yeah.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.554
Now we’re connected, Lucky.

00:06:58.629 --> 00:07:01.129
Actually, he’s fully recovered.

00:07:01.129 --> 00:07:01.978
Really?

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:09.326
You said no one has confirmed to adopt him, right?

00:07:09.326 --> 00:07:11.352
Many people reached out

00:07:11.352 --> 00:07:12.742
but none of them has confirmed to do so.

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:17.740
Can I adopt him then?

00:07:18.435 --> 00:07:19.269
Really?

00:07:19.603 --> 00:07:21.031
That’s wonderful.

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:23.299
Have you named him yet?

00:07:24.051 --> 00:07:25.908
We’re thinking of naming him Lucky.

00:07:27.257 --> 00:07:28.352
Nice name.

00:07:28.668 --> 00:07:30.000
Congrats.

00:07:30.891 --> 00:07:33.391
I’ll prepare the necessary things for you then.

00:07:33.391 --> 00:07:34.793
- Thank you.
- See you in a bit.

00:07:38.001 --> 00:07:39.620
Hi.

00:07:40.004 --> 00:07:43.219
You’ll live with your new daddy.

00:07:43.545 --> 00:07:45.000
Live with me, Lucky.

00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:48.565
THREE WEEKS LATER

00:07:53.177 --> 00:07:53.931
I’m Kita.

00:07:55.456 --> 00:07:56.249
I’m Fuse.

00:08:02.671 --> 00:08:04.218
You guys are here?

00:08:05.114 --> 00:08:06.375
Someone is waiting to see you.

00:08:06.709 --> 00:08:07.479
There.

00:08:10.894 --> 00:08:11.578
Hey!

00:08:11.578 --> 00:08:14.133
Hello, Dol.

00:08:14.133 --> 00:08:15.538
How cute.

00:08:15.538 --> 00:08:17.026
Congrats.

00:08:17.173 --> 00:08:18.205
Are you excited?

00:08:18.348 --> 00:08:19.530
So excited.

00:08:19.643 --> 00:08:21.643
My heart is bursting out of my chest.

00:08:21.643 --> 00:08:22.669
What an overstatement.

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:23.559
Seriously?

00:08:23.559 --> 00:08:24.354
Seriously.

00:08:24.354 --> 00:08:26.208
He couldn’t even sleep last night.

00:08:26.208 --> 00:08:28.208
He called asking me to talk him to sleep all night.

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:31.225
Too much information.

00:08:32.216 --> 00:08:33.549
You guys are great.

00:08:33.659 --> 00:08:35.445
I’m so proud of you, you know?

00:08:37.055 --> 00:08:37.705
Guys.

00:08:37.705 --> 00:08:39.055
We are taking a group photo over there.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:41.813
Will you excuse me, Dol?

00:08:41.813 --> 00:08:42.910
Of course.

00:08:43.132 --> 00:08:44.798
Go on.

00:08:45.227 --> 00:08:46.479
Chop-chop.

00:09:34.812 --> 00:09:36.192
Are you still worried?

00:09:37.243 --> 00:09:38.083
Um.

00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.149
Everyone put in their best effort.

00:09:41.818 --> 00:09:44.628
I’m afraid it’d turn out bad and they…

00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:48.640
Don’t go to that yet.

00:09:50.001 --> 00:09:53.335
Let’s just enjoy the movie for now.

00:10:07.739 --> 00:10:12.384
Thanks to all the cast and staff for bringing this movie this far.

00:10:13.762 --> 00:10:15.667
Especially, the Friend Credits group.

00:10:16.587 --> 00:10:18.230
They initiated this project.

00:10:19.007 --> 00:10:21.984
They raised their own fund and produced the movie themselves.

00:10:23.455 --> 00:10:26.241
Without them, this movie wouldn’t have happened.

00:10:27.114 --> 00:10:29.352
All the credits go to them.

00:10:34.204 --> 00:10:36.847
Since Mr. Mek has said it.

00:10:36.847 --> 00:10:39.638
May I please have someone from Friend Credits up here

00:10:39.638 --> 00:10:41.645
to talk about the movie?

00:10:41.794 --> 00:10:47.273
Can we get Mr. Tess, the producer, here to say something about it?

00:10:47.627 --> 00:10:48.674
Please.

00:10:52.953 --> 00:10:54.128
Go on.

00:10:54.557 --> 00:10:57.550
Be our representative.

00:10:58.676 --> 00:10:59.748
Besides,

00:11:00.248 --> 00:11:01.676
I want to hear your speech.

00:11:02.378 --> 00:11:03.056
Go on.

00:11:03.056 --> 00:11:04.857
If you won’t, I will.

00:11:04.857 --> 00:11:06.492
You stay here.

00:11:06.854 --> 00:11:08.854
Please give it up for Tess.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.523
Please.

00:11:24.203 --> 00:11:26.203
Hi.

00:11:27.418 --> 00:11:28.576
Err,

00:11:29.418 --> 00:11:31.118
I don’t know what to say.

00:11:32.318 --> 00:11:39.608
I just want to say that making a movie is miraculous to me.

00:11:40.257 --> 00:11:45.784
It can bring strangers to spend a certain time together.

00:11:45.889 --> 00:11:47.198
Did I do well?

00:11:47.198 --> 00:11:47.972
You surely did.

00:11:47.972 --> 00:11:50.582
I’m sure you’ll be famous because of this.

00:11:52.456 --> 00:11:58.650
When the movie ends, we become brothers, sisters, family,

00:11:59.257 --> 00:12:01.567
and everything for each other.

00:12:02.177 --> 00:12:03.986
Thank you to all of you,

00:12:04.263 --> 00:12:08.217
the staff, and the fans who have come to this event.

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:14.448
Thanks to the one who always stays by my side every day.

00:12:15.127 --> 00:12:15.977
Look.

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:17.509
You like the colors I did there?

00:12:19.144 --> 00:12:20.739
Do I still need to say?

00:12:20.873 --> 00:12:21.896
They are very beautiful.

00:12:31.975 --> 00:12:33.022
Thank you.

00:12:47.219 --> 00:12:51.411
You guys are the reason I want to live long and do what I love.

00:12:51.634 --> 00:12:56.493
And you guys make me realize what I actually love.

00:13:30.608 --> 00:13:31.753
Wow!

00:13:31.753 --> 00:13:32.536
Guys,

00:13:33.189 --> 00:13:35.596
whether our movie is a box office success or not,

00:13:36.238 --> 00:13:39.943
I'm glad we did our best to get it into theaters.

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:41.089
Right.

00:13:41.496 --> 00:13:45.612
You guys are the reason I want to live long and do what I love.

00:13:48.105 --> 00:13:52.955
And you guys make me realize what I actually love.

00:13:56.747 --> 00:13:59.485
Aw!!

00:13:59.485 --> 00:14:01.088
Come on.

00:14:01.126 --> 00:14:03.304
It’s just water but cheers anyway!

00:14:03.304 --> 00:14:05.121
Cheers!

00:14:28.449 --> 00:14:30.118
What are you doing, Tun?

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.015
Cleaning your face.

00:14:32.088 --> 00:14:33.477
It’s a mess.

00:14:33.679 --> 00:14:35.348
Why now?

00:14:35.957 --> 00:14:37.703
You can do it at home.

00:14:38.823 --> 00:14:40.823
I’ve prepared it for you.

00:14:40.823 --> 00:14:42.950
As I know we have lots to do today.

00:15:02.058 --> 00:15:03.804
It’s such a long day for you.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:06.670
And with all the dust,

00:15:07.988 --> 00:15:09.312
we should wipe it off right away.

00:15:13.256 --> 00:15:14.136
Why?

00:15:14.831 --> 00:15:18.180
You can’t take it when I look bad just for a second?

00:15:20.391 --> 00:15:21.454
It’s not that.

00:15:21.836 --> 00:15:24.249
I’m not cleaning it because I’m afraid you’d look bad.

00:15:26.090 --> 00:15:27.536
I just want to take care of you.

00:15:54.271 --> 00:15:55.431
Thank you

00:15:56.991 --> 00:15:58.787
for cleaning my face,

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:01.477
and for

00:16:03.538 --> 00:16:05.266
cleaning off my dusty heart.

00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:08.745
It’s now back in use again.

00:16:18.124 --> 00:16:19.437
Aou!

00:16:21.203 --> 00:16:22.745
Is there any stain on my face?

00:16:22.745 --> 00:16:24.598
Where? Let me see.

00:16:24.598 --> 00:16:25.867
Right here, my friend.

00:16:25.867 --> 00:16:27.112
- Here?
- Yes.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:28.235
Let me wipe it for you.

00:16:29.743 --> 00:16:32.659
Aou, can you wipe away the dust in my heart?

00:16:32.659 --> 00:16:33.430
Why?

00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:35.187
I want to bring it back to life.

00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:38.351
Let me clean it for you.

00:16:40.306 --> 00:16:43.197
Hey, I can’t hide my excitement.

00:16:44.093 --> 00:16:46.551
I didn’t expect many people to love our movie.

00:16:47.038 --> 00:16:48.478
Don’t speak too soon.

00:16:48.478 --> 00:16:50.770
Wait until you read the critiques from the movie review pages.

00:16:51.516 --> 00:16:53.440
It will turn out fine.

00:16:53.694 --> 00:16:54.583
Trust me.

00:16:55.134 --> 00:16:57.536
The script you wrote is great.

00:16:58.655 --> 00:16:59.574
No.

00:16:59.956 --> 00:17:01.622
Because your color grading is great.

00:17:02.424 --> 00:17:04.042
Because your dialogues are heartfelt.

00:17:04.499 --> 00:17:06.117
Can I get a reward from you then?

00:17:08.431 --> 00:17:09.442
What do you want?

00:17:09.722 --> 00:17:12.772
Can I use your bathtub tonight?

00:17:13.764 --> 00:17:14.600
Sure.

00:17:15.339 --> 00:17:16.537
I’m not done.

00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:19.425
Can I use it with you?

00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:22.084
Tun, you asshole.

00:17:22.536 --> 00:17:23.518
What?

00:17:23.518 --> 00:17:25.538
You already agreed to it. Don’t break your word.

00:17:25.895 --> 00:17:26.745
No!

00:17:29.975 --> 00:17:32.382
I missed your bathtub so much.

00:17:32.537 --> 00:17:33.977
Take a bath only.

00:17:33.977 --> 00:17:35.537
Of course.

00:17:35.537 --> 00:17:36.978
What else do you think I’ll do?

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:38.679
Be quiet.

00:17:40.204 --> 00:17:41.822
I can’t be.

00:17:42.075 --> 00:17:44.177
Because I’m reading the movie feedback on the pages.

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.016
Let’s read it together.

00:17:47.044 --> 00:17:48.611
I left my phone outside.

00:17:48.611 --> 00:17:49.779
Let me go grab it.

00:17:49.983 --> 00:17:50.859
Hey.

00:17:51.998 --> 00:17:52.973
No need.

00:17:52.973 --> 00:17:54.227
Read it with me.

00:18:02.188 --> 00:18:02.976
Look.

00:18:03.332 --> 00:18:06.936
“Nung Tid Mun” page says that the movie is with an interesting point.

00:18:06.936 --> 00:18:08.933
How the story is told differs from in other movies.

00:18:09.147 --> 00:18:10.689
The romantic scene is fulfilling.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:12.392
We get 10 out of 10.

00:18:17.048 --> 00:18:19.786
It says here that the movie has a little dark comedy.

00:18:19.894 --> 00:18:21.589
9 out of 10.

00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.198
Damn!

00:18:23.731 --> 00:18:28.428
Movie Seer says the characters and how we present the story are both outstanding.

00:18:28.428 --> 00:18:31.204
It’s an up-and-coming Thai movie of the year.

00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:35.232
The screenwriters have done a much better job than in their last movie.

00:18:35.394 --> 00:18:36.656
10 out of 10.

00:18:36.759 --> 00:18:38.479
Holy shit!

00:18:39.037 --> 00:18:41.622
We won Khai and Third’s hearts.

00:18:54.617 --> 00:18:56.821
You just rewarded me.

00:18:57.119 --> 00:18:59.424
Can I reward you back?

00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:03.251
What is my reward?

00:19:41.086 --> 00:19:43.086
Thank you for everything.

00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.066
I thank you too.

00:20:22.349 --> 00:20:24.680
Lucky, come here. Good boy.

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.547
I thought I adopted only one.

00:20:26.547 --> 00:20:28.154
When did that become two?

00:20:28.413 --> 00:20:30.413
Do you want to get bitten?

00:20:30.474 --> 00:20:32.474
Lucky, come to Daddy.

00:20:32.682 --> 00:20:34.402
Don’t play with this aggressive dog.

00:20:34.402 --> 00:20:36.615
Well, well.

00:20:36.874 --> 00:20:39.154
It’s good you adopted Lucky.

00:20:40.256 --> 00:20:43.426
You know I wanted to have a dog as a kid.

00:20:43.752 --> 00:20:46.668
I wanted to take my pet everywhere with me.

00:20:47.235 --> 00:20:49.235
But my dad wouldn’t allow me to do it.

00:20:49.235 --> 00:20:50.285
What a shame.

00:20:50.285 --> 00:20:51.464
Whatever!

00:20:51.464 --> 00:20:52.055
What?

00:20:52.055 --> 00:20:53.844
Who would want to take their pet everywhere?

00:20:54.452 --> 00:20:56.070
A lot of people.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.069
The example is near.

00:20:58.069 --> 00:20:59.119
You!

00:20:59.119 --> 00:21:00.371
You asked me to drag you everywhere.

00:21:00.371 --> 00:21:01.156
No!

00:21:01.156 --> 00:21:02.486
I take you everywhere.

00:21:02.486 --> 00:21:03.799
You’re my dog.

00:21:03.799 --> 00:21:04.862
You’re my dog!

00:21:04.862 --> 00:21:05.450
You’re my dog.

00:21:05.450 --> 00:21:07.075
You’re my dog. Hand!

00:21:07.075 --> 00:21:08.531
Come on.

00:21:09.898 --> 00:21:11.898
Fine!

00:21:11.898 --> 00:21:12.678
Here.

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:13.995
Good boy.

00:21:13.995 --> 00:21:15.761
Now, get down.

00:21:15.761 --> 00:21:18.406
I don’t know how to get down but I know how to attack.

00:21:19.559 --> 00:21:20.821
Fuse!

00:21:20.821 --> 00:21:22.284
What are you doing?

00:21:22.386 --> 00:21:23.674
Get off me.

00:21:23.674 --> 00:21:24.846
Eat this.

00:21:24.846 --> 00:21:26.389
You eat it.

00:21:28.303 --> 00:21:30.074
Open your mouth.

00:21:30.074 --> 00:21:30.927
Do it.

00:21:39.345 --> 00:21:41.345
Can I get this one and this one, please?

00:21:41.345 --> 00:21:42.528
Absolutely.

00:21:42.528 --> 00:21:48.282
(The film Romantic (Non) Comedy has been a huge success.)

00:21:48.282 --> 00:21:51.703
(After only one week in theaters, the film has already grossed 10 million.)

00:21:51.703 --> 00:21:54.774
(This is an interesting miraculous event.)

00:21:58.437 --> 00:21:59.243
Excuse me.

00:21:59.243 --> 00:22:00.157
Yes?

00:22:00.756 --> 00:22:02.756
Can I get these cotton cady bread too?

00:22:02.891 --> 00:22:04.204
Sure. How many pieces?

00:22:05.389 --> 00:22:06.600
All of it.

00:22:06.683 --> 00:22:07.971
All of it?

00:22:09.017 --> 00:22:10.186
Excuse me.

00:22:10.186 --> 00:22:11.017
Yes?

00:22:11.592 --> 00:22:14.075
If you have more, I’ll take more.

00:22:14.075 --> 00:22:15.292
Of course.

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:15.913
Thank you.

00:22:25.274 --> 00:22:27.536
Mek recommended this black and white film.

00:22:28.032 --> 00:22:29.058
You want to watch it?

00:22:29.185 --> 00:22:29.981
Yeah.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:33.583
I read the synopsis. Pretty promising.

00:22:33.761 --> 00:22:34.563
Let’s watch it.

00:22:35.229 --> 00:22:35.911
Hey.

00:22:38.023 --> 00:22:39.824
Should we guess the real colors of the film?

00:22:42.247 --> 00:22:44.934
I couldn’t even guess what you look like.

00:22:45.197 --> 00:22:46.714
I can’t guess its colors.

00:22:49.267 --> 00:22:51.547
What is the color of that tree’s leaves?

00:22:51.973 --> 00:22:53.053
Damn you!

00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:55.856
Language!

00:22:56.071 --> 00:22:58.071
You can’t curse at someone you like.

00:23:06.183 --> 00:23:08.565
What’s her shirt’s color?

00:23:08.811 --> 00:23:11.116
Based on my extensive experience,

00:23:12.297 --> 00:23:13.915
I’m sure it’s yellow.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.280
Not even close.

00:23:19.374 --> 00:23:20.840
It’s blue.

00:23:22.826 --> 00:23:23.581
Wait.

00:23:23.708 --> 00:23:24.775
How do you know?

00:23:26.299 --> 00:23:30.335
There are like 100 pictures of the behind-the-scenes on the director’s personal website.

00:23:30.732 --> 00:23:32.732
You’re a cheater.

00:23:32.869 --> 00:23:34.258
I’m not.

00:23:34.258 --> 00:23:35.776
You’re the only one guessing here.

00:23:37.892 --> 00:23:40.426
Now try guessing the color of the building in this scene.

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:42.092
Pink.

00:23:42.536 --> 00:23:44.325
Smart.

00:23:44.441 --> 00:23:46.059
Of course.

00:23:46.059 --> 00:23:48.698
How about the girl’s high heels?

00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:50.066
Pink.

00:23:50.066 --> 00:23:51.110
No.

00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:52.051
They’re green.

00:23:53.363 --> 00:23:54.880
And her bow?

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.583
Pink.

00:23:55.583 --> 00:23:59.032
And there, her scarf is also pink.

00:23:59.032 --> 00:24:01.667
The balloon behind the kid is pink as well.

00:24:02.690 --> 00:24:04.588
What is it with you and the pink color?

00:24:04.588 --> 00:24:05.521
I’m just saying.

00:24:05.957 --> 00:24:07.536
It’s your favorite color after all.

00:24:09.170 --> 00:24:10.190
Says who?

00:24:10.343 --> 00:24:12.061
You also like pink.

00:24:12.191 --> 00:24:15.056
I’ve told you many times I dislike pink.

00:24:19.127 --> 00:24:20.618
Oh, yeah?

00:24:25.267 --> 00:24:26.758
Think again.

00:24:27.537 --> 00:24:31.140
You’ve been involving yourself with pink more often.

00:24:31.377 --> 00:24:34.446
Like when you’re grading the movie colors, you went with pink more.

00:24:34.986 --> 00:24:37.536
For some stuff you use, you choose pink.

00:24:38.248 --> 00:24:39.143
Really?

00:24:40.673 --> 00:24:42.215
I didn’t realize that.

00:24:50.798 --> 00:24:51.604
Talay,

00:24:53.538 --> 00:24:55.953
have you ever heard of The Pink Theory?

00:24:57.536 --> 00:24:58.567
No.

00:24:58.872 --> 00:25:05.108
The Pink Theory talks about color blending when two worlds become one.

00:25:05.108 --> 00:25:06.712
When two people meet.

00:25:07.073 --> 00:25:08.420
To give you an example,

00:25:09.073 --> 00:25:10.438
I like pink.

00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:15.908
When you and I start to like each other, you start to focus more on the pink color.

00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:23.899
Anything in pink that you see will remind you more of me.

00:25:26.026 --> 00:25:27.395
That’s Pakorn’s.

00:25:27.828 --> 00:25:29.146
That’s why I wear it.

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:32.737
The special strawberry smoothie from me.

00:25:37.652 --> 00:25:42.146
And then, you become fond of the color without knowing it.

00:25:42.777 --> 00:25:45.998
Because you see me in that pink color you see.

00:26:06.384 --> 00:26:07.225
Hey!

00:26:09.693 --> 00:26:13.498
Is pink something that can take us home?

00:26:16.882 --> 00:26:17.833
How?

00:26:19.197 --> 00:26:23.869
You and I don’t share the same interest at all.

00:26:24.636 --> 00:26:28.188
But this is the first thing we both really like.

00:26:34.449 --> 00:26:36.449
To our universal-traveling friendship.

00:26:36.449 --> 00:26:37.220
Cheers!

00:26:38.509 --> 00:26:39.642
A Pink Trumpet tree.

00:26:39.642 --> 00:26:43.384
Won’t you be happy to wake up and see a pretty pink tree?

00:26:45.913 --> 00:26:47.379
I don’t like pink.

00:26:47.885 --> 00:26:49.885
Why so much bacon?

00:26:50.194 --> 00:26:53.619
You keep saying you hate pink so I gave you a lot.

00:27:02.796 --> 00:27:04.796
Who was that mean person you talked about?

00:27:04.796 --> 00:27:06.291
The one I’m hitting on.

00:27:08.102 --> 00:27:11.247
I think I found something that has linked us for a long time.

00:27:11.412 --> 00:27:13.005
Just like Dol said.

00:27:13.005 --> 00:27:16.347
If we’re each other’s portkeys, there will be something that connects us.

00:27:20.371 --> 00:27:21.811
Have we really found it?

00:27:38.773 --> 00:27:39.908
Shit!

00:27:39.908 --> 00:27:41.961
Our movie will be shown at a festival.

00:27:42.199 --> 00:27:43.995
Just like you dream it, Talay.

00:27:43.995 --> 00:27:48.037
Your mom and I are very proud of you, Tun.

00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:23.440
You guys asked me here to just lie down?

00:28:24.573 --> 00:28:25.833
No.

00:28:27.966 --> 00:28:31.351
We asked you here because we have good news.

00:28:36.024 --> 00:28:40.924
Now we know for sure we’re each other’s portkeys.

00:28:46.533 --> 00:28:47.367
See?

00:28:47.857 --> 00:28:51.201
I told you. You guys are right for each other.

00:28:52.044 --> 00:28:54.748
What are you going to do now?

00:28:59.436 --> 00:29:04.486
We probably live on together until we dream and go home.

00:29:05.656 --> 00:29:06.824
Right.

00:29:07.538 --> 00:29:09.239
We don’t know when that will happen

00:29:09.524 --> 00:29:12.015
so we took this chance to say goodbye to you just in case.

00:29:17.384 --> 00:29:20.024
Joob would be so delighted if she was still here.

00:29:21.009 --> 00:29:23.926
If she knew you two would return home.

00:29:32.886 --> 00:29:33.920
Good luck.

00:29:35.392 --> 00:29:37.275
I wish you two the best.

00:29:38.531 --> 00:29:41.981
I hope to see you guys again.

00:29:44.175 --> 00:29:45.557
I’m off to work now.

00:29:48.601 --> 00:29:49.769
Wait, Dol.

00:29:56.503 --> 00:29:58.290
I’m really grateful to you.

00:30:00.561 --> 00:30:03.052
If I didn’t meet you at the hospital that day,

00:30:04.496 --> 00:30:06.496
I have no idea how my life here would be.

00:30:08.887 --> 00:30:09.788
That’s right.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:14.538
You and Joob are my great benefactors.

00:30:15.416 --> 00:30:16.670
Thank you so much.

00:30:19.437 --> 00:30:21.437
Why making that face?

00:30:22.742 --> 00:30:25.808
I planned not to say a sad goodbye.

00:30:26.189 --> 00:30:28.616
Why did you drag me to this? Come here.

00:30:31.381 --> 00:30:32.973
Don’t forget about me.

00:30:34.479 --> 00:30:35.754
Don’t forget me.

00:30:36.059 --> 00:30:37.206
We promise.

00:30:37.695 --> 00:30:39.183
We won’t forget about you.

00:30:53.688 --> 00:30:57.181
I submitted our film to Kannes Film Festival.

00:30:58.326 --> 00:30:59.622
I like the name so much.

00:31:00.043 --> 00:31:02.470
It reminds me of Cannes Film Festival.

00:31:03.023 --> 00:31:06.281
I just hope it gets to show.

00:31:07.507 --> 00:31:11.405
Once in a lifetime, our movie is part of a film festival.

00:31:19.089 --> 00:31:19.810
Shit!

00:31:20.684 --> 00:31:21.686
They have replied.

00:31:24.917 --> 00:31:25.808
What did they say?

00:31:35.294 --> 00:31:36.358
It won’t get to show.

00:31:41.455 --> 00:31:42.263
Damn!

00:31:42.690 --> 00:31:43.440
No?

00:31:50.152 --> 00:31:52.039
It won’t get to show only in Bangkok,

00:31:52.529 --> 00:31:55.692
but in Kanchanaburi as well.

00:31:59.024 --> 00:32:00.071
Damn you!

00:32:00.199 --> 00:32:01.643
Did you just fool me?

00:32:05.573 --> 00:32:06.763
Shit!

00:32:07.407 --> 00:32:09.600
Our movie will be shown at a festival.

00:32:09.825 --> 00:32:11.526
Just like you dream it, Talay.

00:32:24.377 --> 00:32:27.294
You had all the time in the world but decided to pack one night before?

00:32:27.431 --> 00:32:29.431
I’ve been lazy.

00:32:29.563 --> 00:32:30.403
Here.

00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:31.777
I’m done packing.

00:32:31.777 --> 00:32:33.685
Wired charger and the portable charger?

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:34.294
All set.

00:32:34.294 --> 00:32:35.151
Boxers?

00:32:38.115 --> 00:32:38.749
Here.

00:32:40.005 --> 00:32:41.321
Pakorn’s favorite.

00:32:42.985 --> 00:32:43.720
Nice, huh?

00:32:48.818 --> 00:32:49.752
Toothbrush?

00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:51.757
Hey, I forgot.

00:32:51.757 --> 00:32:52.607
It’s in the bathroom.

00:32:53.675 --> 00:32:55.200
Let’s go brush our teeth first then.

00:32:55.366 --> 00:32:58.752
Here. I’ll teach you how to brush your teeth.

00:32:59.384 --> 00:33:02.554
Are you a kindergarten teacher to give the lesson?

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.995
Hey, I’m a pro.

00:33:05.995 --> 00:33:08.077
Always included in the actors with beautiful smiles poll.

00:33:09.812 --> 00:33:11.428
You said people called you Solemn Face.

00:33:13.027 --> 00:33:16.477
I do smile for someone I like.

00:33:25.425 --> 00:33:26.379
Wait.

00:33:27.317 --> 00:33:29.480
Follow my demonstration, Talay.

00:33:30.815 --> 00:33:32.346
Yes, Teacher Tun.

00:33:55.944 --> 00:33:57.283
Now wash it off.

00:34:46.757 --> 00:34:48.202
You can go to bed.

00:34:48.579 --> 00:34:49.746
I’ll be just downstairs.

00:34:49.746 --> 00:34:50.579
Don’t wait for me.

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.963
Where are you going?

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.160
It’ll be just a moment.

00:34:54.339 --> 00:34:55.315
I’ll be right back.

00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:15.937
I heard you guys are camping out.

00:35:15.937 --> 00:35:17.498
I’ve got you a mosquito repellent.

00:35:18.737 --> 00:35:20.993
Here is some snacks I bought for you.

00:35:22.172 --> 00:35:24.720
Share them with your friends and have fun traveling.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.952
Your mom and I are very proud of you, Tun.

00:35:30.094 --> 00:35:30.814
Thank you.

00:35:39.669 --> 00:35:44.036
Do you remember the days you wondered why I’d changed?

00:35:46.095 --> 00:35:47.480
I do.

00:35:47.663 --> 00:35:49.919
You were really awkward then.

00:35:49.919 --> 00:35:52.554
You didn’t remember anything about your family.

00:35:55.072 --> 00:36:01.935
What if I say the person sitting in front of you here isn’t Tun?

00:36:02.364 --> 00:36:03.440
He’s someone else.

00:36:04.124 --> 00:36:07.830
Will you still love and feel proud of me?

00:36:09.836 --> 00:36:12.263
Tun, why would you ask that?

00:36:14.227 --> 00:36:15.423
Ah,

00:36:16.959 --> 00:36:19.085
the plot for your next film, huh?

00:36:21.687 --> 00:36:22.531
Right.

00:36:22.531 --> 00:36:23.921
I’m trying to get some ideas.

00:36:25.591 --> 00:36:27.335
If you really were someone else,

00:36:28.243 --> 00:36:33.037
I’d love you and be proud of you even more.

00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:40.710
Why?

00:36:41.664 --> 00:36:47.439
Because you try so hard even though this is not your true body.

00:36:48.703 --> 00:36:53.440
You live Tun’s life and give Tun’s movie an award.

00:36:55.866 --> 00:36:57.567
It isn’t easy, son.

00:36:59.582 --> 00:37:00.558
You’re great.

00:37:04.078 --> 00:37:05.289
So great.

00:37:13.302 --> 00:37:15.963
Why are you crying?

00:37:18.250 --> 00:37:20.250
Are you so into the plot?

00:37:22.612 --> 00:37:24.634
Very much so.

00:37:25.310 --> 00:37:31.213
In my head, the one in Tun’s body is returning home.

00:37:32.606 --> 00:37:34.606
So he wants to say goodbye to your both.

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:40.303
I love you.

00:37:41.782 --> 00:37:43.270
Gosh, my son.

00:37:43.441 --> 00:37:45.676
You’re working too hard on your screenplay.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.301
You become weirder every day.

00:37:49.579 --> 00:37:53.541
How about we share our positive energy?

00:37:53.602 --> 00:37:55.602
Group hug. Come here.

00:37:55.602 --> 00:37:57.271
Let’s hug.

00:37:57.551 --> 00:37:59.167
We love you so much.

00:37:59.695 --> 00:38:01.077
I love you, Tun.

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:02.880
So much.

00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.644
Ever since the first day.

00:38:05.071 --> 00:38:05.712
Come on.

00:38:07.502 --> 00:38:09.502
If the stars have their own color,

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:11.743
what color should they each have?

00:38:12.868 --> 00:38:14.569
I now can think of the color.

00:38:15.652 --> 00:38:16.586
Our color.

00:38:52.461 --> 00:38:56.396
Kannes Film Festival, I’m ready for you!

00:38:56.528 --> 00:38:57.872
Ready to watch the film?

00:38:57.872 --> 00:38:59.402
Ready to get an award.

00:38:59.982 --> 00:39:04.097
My right hand is ready to grab the Golden Cassava Trophy.

00:39:04.097 --> 00:39:07.236
I’ll say a nice speech and walk off the stage charmingly.

00:39:07.236 --> 00:39:09.274
Let me warm up my voice for now.

00:39:10.097 --> 00:39:14.844
Do-do-do.

00:39:15.755 --> 00:39:16.739
Hey.

00:39:19.361 --> 00:39:20.439
Do you look good now?

00:39:23.453 --> 00:39:25.097
No way.

00:39:25.499 --> 00:39:27.097
Your suit tilts.

00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:34.602
How nice it is to have you as my personal stylist.

00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:37.834
Can I reward you with a kiss?

00:39:39.409 --> 00:39:40.817
Kiss my foot!

00:39:45.498 --> 00:39:46.388
Let’s go.

00:39:46.919 --> 00:39:48.528
You look good now, the protagonist.

00:39:49.112 --> 00:39:50.151
Let’s get inside.

00:39:58.517 --> 00:40:00.071
You look good too.

00:40:01.434 --> 00:40:03.434
It’s the truth.

00:40:09.041 --> 00:40:10.097
Hey!

00:40:11.608 --> 00:40:12.417
Hey!

00:40:12.417 --> 00:40:15.229
You two just stop flirting.

00:40:15.229 --> 00:40:16.641
The event is about to start. Come on.

00:40:24.218 --> 00:40:27.904
Look at the hand that was so ready to grab the trophy, Up.

00:40:28.097 --> 00:40:29.314
All I see is emptiness.

00:40:30.290 --> 00:40:32.290
I thought we’d surely get it.

00:40:32.553 --> 00:40:36.582
Last night, in my dream, my hand was holding a trophy.

00:40:36.707 --> 00:40:37.832
My right hand.

00:40:39.895 --> 00:40:42.377
I should have bribed the judges.

00:40:43.623 --> 00:40:44.770
Just kidding.

00:40:45.017 --> 00:40:46.244
It’s all right, guys.

00:40:47.182 --> 00:40:52.741
Who knows? In another universe, we might even get a Golden Palm.

00:40:52.741 --> 00:40:54.091
Golden Palm?

00:40:54.590 --> 00:40:56.184
Even bigger than cassava.

00:41:01.484 --> 00:41:05.513
We’re so great already to make it this far.

00:41:07.305 --> 00:41:09.305
That’s right.

00:41:09.649 --> 00:41:14.178
We might not get an award today but if I get to make movies again,

00:41:14.178 --> 00:41:16.368
all the trophies from every category will be mine.

00:41:16.562 --> 00:41:18.281
Sleep and dream about it, Aou.

00:41:19.621 --> 00:41:20.497
Let’s get back.

00:41:21.434 --> 00:41:23.807
I want to camp out already.

00:41:24.165 --> 00:41:25.884
Let’s go then.

00:41:25.884 --> 00:41:27.500
Get up.

00:41:36.371 --> 00:41:39.463
It’s time! Let’s take down the wishes that have already come true.

00:41:39.657 --> 00:41:42.624
I’ll go first. One of my wishes has already come true.

00:41:46.436 --> 00:41:51.183
I wished for our movie to be shown at the Kannes Film Festival.

00:41:51.183 --> 00:41:54.843
And it’s a success!

00:41:57.723 --> 00:41:59.817
Mine is right here.

00:42:02.594 --> 00:42:05.417
My wish was…

00:42:07.413 --> 00:42:08.882
to get a dog.

00:42:09.877 --> 00:42:11.377
Wait.

00:42:11.452 --> 00:42:13.296
When did you even have a dog, Aou?

00:42:13.296 --> 00:42:14.658
He’s Fuse’s dog.

00:42:14.658 --> 00:42:15.884
He has one in his mouth.

00:42:16.403 --> 00:42:18.278
Damn you.

00:42:18.278 --> 00:42:21.137
He’s like my dog.

00:42:21.137 --> 00:42:22.985
I’m the one taking care of the dog.

00:42:22.985 --> 00:42:24.074
Ahem!

00:42:25.038 --> 00:42:25.812
What?

00:42:25.812 --> 00:42:27.038
What’s stuck in your throat?

00:42:28.496 --> 00:42:30.496
Tess, what’s your wish?

00:42:41.302 --> 00:42:43.177
I wished to find the port…

00:42:48.144 --> 00:42:49.738
Someone I like.

00:42:51.004 --> 00:42:54.617
And I’ve found him.

00:42:57.929 --> 00:42:59.929
Gosh! People in love stink.

00:42:59.929 --> 00:43:01.708
Let’s skip to Tun.

00:43:01.708 --> 00:43:02.555
Right.

00:43:02.555 --> 00:43:05.331
Tun has just one wish there.

00:43:06.275 --> 00:43:07.219
Go.

00:43:20.469 --> 00:43:23.377
Mine has already come true as well.

00:43:26.730 --> 00:43:29.448
Aren’t you gonna say what you wished for?

00:43:29.448 --> 00:43:30.648
Don’t break the rule.

00:43:30.835 --> 00:43:31.905
Tell us.

00:43:32.245 --> 00:43:33.977
I won’t.

00:43:34.703 --> 00:43:36.297
Tess is the only one allowed to know.

00:43:39.948 --> 00:43:41.817
They’ve got a secret.

00:43:41.817 --> 00:43:43.065
Guys.

00:43:43.542 --> 00:43:45.230
Pan Grilled Pork is ready.

00:43:45.230 --> 00:43:46.098
Let’s celebrate.

00:43:46.452 --> 00:43:47.461
Pan Grilled Pork?

00:43:48.617 --> 00:43:49.827
What is it?

00:43:50.087 --> 00:43:51.900
I didn’t know it either at first.

00:43:52.056 --> 00:43:55.024
But Tess said it was traditional food of a tribe overseas.

00:43:55.273 --> 00:43:58.553
We grill the pork on a pan until it’s cooked.

00:43:58.758 --> 00:44:00.508
Then we dip it in the sauce.

00:44:00.508 --> 00:44:01.670
It’s so good.

00:44:01.778 --> 00:44:02.701
Try it.

00:44:05.937 --> 00:44:07.951
You lied to them. It isn’t tribal food.

00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:12.624
I couldn’t say it’s food from the other universe, could I?

00:44:13.962 --> 00:44:14.963
Right.

00:44:15.633 --> 00:44:17.633
Guys, let’s go.

00:44:17.633 --> 00:44:18.439
I’m starving.

00:44:19.931 --> 00:44:21.931
Come on. Time to eat.

00:44:21.931 --> 00:44:22.933
Pan Grilled Pork is so good.

00:44:22.933 --> 00:44:23.938
Trust me.

00:44:23.938 --> 00:44:25.471
Pan Grilled Pork?

00:44:36.697 --> 00:44:39.914
I had no idea there’s a thing called Pan Grilled Pork in this world.

00:44:39.914 --> 00:44:40.953
It’s freaking good.

00:44:41.351 --> 00:44:43.632
Can we make it again some other time?

00:44:44.078 --> 00:44:46.546
I’m afraid we won’t get the chance to do so.

00:44:51.486 --> 00:44:52.551
Why not?

00:44:53.175 --> 00:44:58.418
I just feel like we’re growing up every day.

00:44:59.669 --> 00:45:03.636
We have our dreams and burdens to handle.

00:45:05.172 --> 00:45:08.171
We might not get a chance to gather like this again.

00:45:09.614 --> 00:45:14.455
When that day comes, will you be okay?

00:45:18.527 --> 00:45:19.965
It must be sad.

00:45:20.535 --> 00:45:27.030
I don’t know if we get a chance to do anything like this again.

00:45:28.097 --> 00:45:30.097
I just want you all to know

00:45:30.533 --> 00:45:33.376
no matter how much time passes,

00:45:34.097 --> 00:45:37.783
the memories we have today will remain.

00:45:41.325 --> 00:45:46.097
I just hope, in the future, when you guys look back,

00:45:46.327 --> 00:45:48.608
you will see us when we’re happy together

00:45:48.872 --> 00:45:50.497
just like today.

00:46:00.723 --> 00:46:02.005
Clearly.

00:46:02.005 --> 00:46:04.350
Are you quitting this job for good?

00:46:05.547 --> 00:46:07.890
It sounds like a farewell.

00:46:10.098 --> 00:46:12.098
It isn’t a farewell.

00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:15.093
I’ll be just right here, always.

00:46:18.229 --> 00:46:19.605
And forever.

00:46:25.402 --> 00:46:27.017
I love you all.

00:46:27.809 --> 00:46:29.809
Don’t know if that’s a farewell or not.

00:46:30.865 --> 00:46:32.457
But it’s damn touching.

00:46:32.738 --> 00:46:33.813
Guys.

00:46:34.859 --> 00:46:36.110
Group hug.

00:46:42.324 --> 00:46:44.324
I love you all.

00:46:44.324 --> 00:46:47.878
I love you all!

00:46:53.821 --> 00:46:55.821
Cheers!

00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:20.386
Are you secretly crying here all alone?

00:47:21.525 --> 00:47:22.644
No.

00:47:23.705 --> 00:47:25.398
I’ve just got dust in my eyes.

00:47:34.847 --> 00:47:36.285
You’re such a bad liar.

00:47:45.713 --> 00:47:47.713
If the stars have their own color,

00:47:48.388 --> 00:47:50.013
what color should they each have?

00:47:55.272 --> 00:47:56.773
I can’t think of it.

00:47:59.331 --> 00:48:01.612
But the color that stands out to me

00:48:04.842 --> 00:48:07.935
is the one you asked me to name in Rawi’s Palette color system.

00:48:09.130 --> 00:48:11.130
Have you heard of Pantone?

00:48:11.775 --> 00:48:13.775
The color matching system?

00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:14.879
Right.

00:48:14.879 --> 00:48:18.578
I like to see people through Pantone colors.

00:48:19.042 --> 00:48:21.977
What about me?

00:48:22.097 --> 00:48:22.989
I don’t know.

00:48:27.603 --> 00:48:29.978
What should we name this color system?

00:48:31.631 --> 00:48:32.882
Rawi.

00:48:33.895 --> 00:48:35.617
How about Rawi’s Palette?

00:48:35.784 --> 00:48:37.177
Rawi’s Palette?

00:48:37.437 --> 00:48:40.530
The color system you invented.

00:48:44.472 --> 00:48:46.378
I now can think of the color.

00:48:48.796 --> 00:48:50.109
Its first color.

00:48:51.778 --> 00:48:52.731
Really?

00:48:53.199 --> 00:48:54.246
What color?

00:48:55.959 --> 00:49:03.734
It’s the color that makes me feel the longing and the warmth.

00:49:08.554 --> 00:49:12.552
Sometimes it makes me feel love.

00:49:16.388 --> 00:49:17.795
Pink.

00:49:19.557 --> 00:49:20.742
Our color.

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:23.305
Right.

00:49:25.736 --> 00:49:29.422
I named this color “Shy.”

00:49:32.492 --> 00:49:34.097
Why did you call it that?

00:49:36.565 --> 00:49:40.097
Because sometimes it’s shy

00:49:42.594 --> 00:49:44.875
but so damn cute.

00:49:49.422 --> 00:49:51.297
You mean you or me?

00:49:57.778 --> 00:49:59.653
Thank you so much though.

00:50:00.922 --> 00:50:02.672
I love the name a lot.

00:50:12.250 --> 00:50:16.591
All of a sudden, I feel like I’m an important person in this world.

00:50:17.889 --> 00:50:19.296
You’re exaggerating.

00:50:30.129 --> 00:50:33.537
Do you remember the movie’s ending scene we talked about?

00:50:34.806 --> 00:50:35.994
Of course, I do.

00:50:51.742 --> 00:50:56.895
What do think our ending will be like?

00:50:59.417 --> 00:51:02.697
Everyone wants a happy ending.

00:51:04.361 --> 00:51:11.419
But I think life isn’t that easy.

00:51:12.855 --> 00:51:14.668
What you said is right.

00:51:15.804 --> 00:51:21.113
Even so, I like the dialogue in our movie’s ending scene anyway.

00:51:26.859 --> 00:51:29.202
Though we aren’t together tomorrow,

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:32.179
you’re always here

00:51:33.022 --> 00:51:34.366
in my memories.

00:52:21.931 --> 00:52:25.835
I don’t know when we will get to go home.

00:52:29.521 --> 00:52:31.521
But no matter where you’ll be,

00:52:32.657 --> 00:52:37.092
I promise I’ll look for you.

00:52:47.285 --> 00:52:49.285
If I tell you my name,

00:52:50.036 --> 00:52:54.177
will you promise to name my color?

00:52:57.707 --> 00:52:59.707
Before we go back,

00:53:00.785 --> 00:53:02.972
I want you to know my real name.

00:53:03.803 --> 00:53:05.647
Maybe you can find me first.

00:53:07.004 --> 00:53:08.192
My name is…

00:53:45.322 --> 00:53:46.323
Tun.

00:53:46.323 --> 00:53:49.579
Tun!

00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.880
I dreamed.

00:53:51.286 --> 00:53:52.750
Shit! I just dreamed.

00:53:52.994 --> 00:53:54.588
We’re going home.

00:53:55.025 --> 00:53:55.900
Tun!

00:54:04.728 --> 00:54:05.979
Holy shit!

00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:07.868
I dreamed too, Tess!

00:54:08.944 --> 00:54:10.694
We’re finally back in our universe.

00:54:25.842 --> 00:54:26.902
What?

00:54:27.544 --> 00:54:28.826
Don’t tell me

00:54:31.618 --> 00:54:33.087
you’re Pakorn.

00:54:37.781 --> 00:54:41.373
Yes, I am Pakorn.

00:54:54.628 --> 00:54:56.191
Are you Talay?

00:55:03.525 --> 00:55:05.119
That means…

00:55:07.849 --> 00:55:10.411
You and Tess aren’t back home yet.

00:55:26.864 --> 00:55:29.801
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

00:56:17.434 --> 00:56:18.529
Here.

00:56:30.130 --> 00:56:30.957
Hey!

00:56:30.957 --> 00:56:32.130
This too.

00:56:32.623 --> 00:56:35.057
It tastes just like when I was filming in our universe.

00:56:35.057 --> 00:56:37.709
Mafia the Movie, Scene 2, Cut 1, Take 1.

00:56:37.709 --> 00:56:39.474
And…action.

00:56:41.404 --> 00:56:47.369
I remember I made all the crew’s mouths water.

00:56:53.686 --> 00:56:55.122
Poor them.

00:56:55.782 --> 00:56:58.937
You’re such a cruel actor.

00:56:58.937 --> 00:57:02.203
I’ll not share it with you anymore then.

00:57:03.369 --> 00:57:05.369
I’m doing this for those crew.

00:57:21.911 --> 00:57:23.287
Are you sulking?

00:57:38.274 --> 00:57:41.741
Chug-chug.

00:58:39.338 --> 00:58:41.338
If I get to go back to that universe,

00:58:42.224 --> 00:58:43.974
If I get to go back to that universe,

00:59:04.755 --> 00:59:06.755
Tun hasn’t told me his real name.

00:59:06.755 --> 00:59:08.314
Do you know his name?

00:59:08.673 --> 00:59:11.297
I think he’s trying to tell you.

00:59:11.474 --> 00:59:12.937
Just like Dol said.

00:59:13.152 --> 00:59:17.177
You must dream and go to that place in order to return.

00:59:17.177 --> 00:59:18.721
I finally found you.

00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:20.959
What the heck are you doing, Pakorn?

00:59:23.466 --> 00:59:24.747
Are you Tess?

00:59:25.246 --> 00:59:26.121
Yes.

00:59:26.576 --> 00:59:27.515
Tess.
