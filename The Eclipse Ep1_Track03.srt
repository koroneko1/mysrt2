4
00:00:36,927 --> 00:00:39,095
The life of a small-town boy

5
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:40,946
is so carefree that

6
00:00:42,052 --> 00:00:45,611
I sometimes wish I could stop time.

7
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:47,400
I don’t want to grow up

8
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:50,618
just to see…

9
00:01:02,918 --> 00:01:06,957
Suppalo is an all-boys secondary school

10
00:01:06,957 --> 00:01:08,861
with a long-standing prestigious reputation

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,616
because we believe that…

12
00:01:11,906 --> 00:01:15,369
With rules comes honor.

13
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:19,574
With rules comes honor.

14
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,006
Just because the rules are long-established doesn’t mean they should continue.

15
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:26,497
With rules comes honor.

16
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:28,882
The school has no right to dehumanize us.
[School uniforms won’t make us smarter.]

17
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:30,795
We have full rights to our bodies.

18
00:01:31,282 --> 00:01:38,240
No school uniform.

19
00:01:51,323 --> 00:01:55,218
Suppalo’s reputation is on your hand, Akk.

20
00:01:56,205 --> 00:01:57,365
Take care of it.

21
00:01:58,332 --> 00:01:59,373
Yes, sir.

22
00:01:59,436 --> 00:02:01,436
(They say as the solar eclipse approaches)

23
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:04,180
(the curse becomes stronger.)

24
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:08,485
No school uniform.

25
00:02:08,485 --> 00:02:09,139
Hey!

26
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,908
Look out!

27
00:02:27,704 --> 00:02:28,760
Shit! No driver.

28
00:02:29,837 --> 00:02:31,837
How did that truck get here with no driver?

29
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,192
Is it the curse again?

30
00:02:38,715 --> 00:02:39,852
Ouch!

31
00:02:39,852 --> 00:02:40,893
It hurts.

32
00:02:53,117 --> 00:02:55,309
Wat, Kan, take care of things here.

33
00:02:55,735 --> 00:02:57,255
Where are you going?

34
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:19,570
Excuse me.

35
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:20,906
Move!

36
00:04:21,132 --> 00:04:22,307
Sorry.

37
00:04:22,499 --> 00:04:23,325
Move!

38
00:04:44,247 --> 00:04:45,240
You, newbie.

39
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:48,325
This restroom is for teachers.

40
00:04:48,325 --> 00:04:49,751
Students have no business using it.

41
00:04:50,692 --> 00:04:51,858
Why are you here then?

42
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,242
I’m a prefect.

43
00:05:14,296 --> 00:05:15,121
So?

44
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,421
Why are you not wearing Suppalo’s school uniform?

45
00:05:21,222 --> 00:05:22,382
I don’t want to.

46
00:05:22,649 --> 00:05:23,905
But you must.

47
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:24,753
It's the rule.

48
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,703
I will when I want to.

49
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,598
Okay?

50
00:05:40,655 --> 00:05:42,079
I’m a prefect.

51
00:05:42,887 --> 00:05:44,887
My duty is to make everyone follow the rules.

52
00:05:46,998 --> 00:05:49,862
Why don’t you deal with that accident instead of picking on me?

53
00:05:50,477 --> 00:05:53,532
Students under your care almost got hit by a car.

54
00:05:54,297 --> 00:05:55,264
Not your concern.

55
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:56,921
We will take care of that.

56
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:58,614
How rigid.

57
00:05:59,561 --> 00:06:03,000
My first day here is already amusing.

58
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:07,690
I'm curious what more this school has in store for me.

59
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:23,785
There was no one in the car.

60
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:25,026
How did it drive itself?

61
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,839
The Suppalo curse.

62
00:06:27,294 --> 00:06:29,000
It was the flower pot last time.

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,983
This time, a ghost car.

64
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:32,274
What next?

65
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:34,703
Here he comes.

66
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:38,704
Look at him.

67
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,951
Hey.

68
00:06:41,153 --> 00:06:42,817
Why a long face?

69
00:06:44,857 --> 00:06:46,257
Did you take care of it?

70
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,740
Yes. Where have you been?

71
00:06:50,401 --> 00:06:51,705
I followed the new kid.

72
00:06:51,862 --> 00:06:53,358
He was acting so shady.

73
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,431
An old issue remains unsolved.

74
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,845
A new issue arises.

75
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:02,562
Kan, you're the biggest fan of the Suppalo curse in our school.

76
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,599
Consider what’s been happening lately.

77
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:08,689
Honestly, this is too much to handle for Mr. Kan.

78
00:07:09,541 --> 00:07:13,028
Mr. Kan, can I just kick you in the face?

79
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:16,698
Wat, you’re talking like a bastard.

80
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:17,927
Are you kicking me?

81
00:07:18,953 --> 00:07:20,360
I must get him.

82
00:07:21,737 --> 00:07:22,802
The newbie?

83
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:26,928
Do you know which class he’s in?

84
00:07:27,092 --> 00:07:28,720
Where will you get him?

85
00:07:31,825 --> 00:07:33,321
Hi, guys.

86
00:07:38,868 --> 00:07:41,684
Today we get to welcome a new friend.

87
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:43,939
Please come in.

88
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:50,655
Introduce yourself to your friends.

89
00:07:52,224 --> 00:07:53,480
My name is Ayan.

90
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,224
You can call me Aye.

91
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,152
Ayan, have a seat next to Thuaphu.

92
00:08:03,161 --> 00:08:05,569
Thuaphu, please help guide him.

93
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,184
Of course, Teacher.

94
00:08:08,164 --> 00:08:09,560
He can sit with me.

95
00:08:11,626 --> 00:08:13,530
Kanlong will sit with Thuaphu.

96
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:16,791
I’m a prefect.

97
00:08:17,103 --> 00:08:18,625
I will take care of him.

98
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,640
Is that okay?

99
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:23,477
Sure.

100
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:28,477
You, come sit here.

101
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,138
Thanks, Akk.

102
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:36,638
Please.

103
00:08:47,495 --> 00:08:49,045
Whatever you’re here for,

104
00:08:49,165 --> 00:08:50,888
I’ll be watching you.

105
00:08:50,888 --> 00:08:51,688
Keep that in mind.

106
00:09:00,055 --> 00:09:02,055
Catch me if you can.

107
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,040
[Ayan Sukkhapisit]

108
00:09:20,552 --> 00:09:22,552
That new kid is really from Parot School.

109
00:09:24,026 --> 00:09:25,834
That’s our rival.

110
00:09:27,121 --> 00:09:30,000
Why did he transfer three weeks after school started?

111
00:09:30,296 --> 00:09:31,720
It’s totally unusual.

112
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,332
Maybe

113
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:38,240
he came to ruin our school’s reputation.

114
00:09:39,568 --> 00:09:40,300
Hey.

115
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,840
In every movie I watch,

116
00:09:43,013 --> 00:09:48,155
each character has a goal and motive to do something.

117
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:50,915
That means

118
00:09:51,684 --> 00:09:54,020
we must find his motive, right?

119
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:55,421
Right.

120
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:57,840
Shameless,

121
00:09:58,174 --> 00:09:59,694
what’s your goal?

122
00:10:01,001 --> 00:10:03,145
But the only goal I have here

123
00:10:05,746 --> 00:10:07,746
is to know when you guys will start eating.

124
00:10:07,746 --> 00:10:08,981
It’s all burnt, jackasses.

125
00:10:09,648 --> 00:10:12,272
Okay. Let’s eat.

126
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,959
And why are you eating BBQ pork in my room?

127
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:17,911
You’re making my room smelly.

128
00:10:18,802 --> 00:10:20,000
Are you eating it or not?

129
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,603
I am!

130
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:09,320
No!

131
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:48,640
[Mom]

132
00:11:54,844 --> 00:11:55,578
Yes, Mom.

133
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,036
How is it going?

134
00:11:57,743 --> 00:11:59,263
Do you need anything from here?

135
00:11:59,263 --> 00:12:01,727
I’ll get it for you after the meeting is done.

136
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,104
No.

137
00:12:03,704 --> 00:12:05,171
You can focus on your work.

138
00:12:05,412 --> 00:12:06,812
You got a flight to catch, don’t you?

139
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,673
How is school?

140
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,274
Good.

141
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:13,643
Pretty fun.

142
00:12:15,463 --> 00:12:18,422
I think you should transfer back to your old school.

143
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:20,117
Parot School?

144
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:21,761
No.

145
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:24,851
The one you’d always gone to.

146
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:29,153
You don’t need to follow…

147
00:12:29,153 --> 00:12:29,991
No.

148
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,607
I will go here.

149
00:12:34,324 --> 00:12:35,676
I’ve made up my mind.

150
00:12:37,098 --> 00:12:38,124
Talk to you later.

151
00:12:39,098 --> 00:12:40,200
I’m going to school.

152
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,699
Hold on, Aye!

153
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:55,856
Why are you here?

154
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,061
Why aren’t you in class?

155
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,000
Is it against the rules to just hang out?

156
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:01,967
Take that back!

157
00:13:01,967 --> 00:13:03,326
You punch me once.

158
00:13:03,446 --> 00:13:05,169
I kiss you once.

159
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,206
The rules there are really strict.

160
00:13:37,362 --> 00:13:41,202
Make one tiny mistake and you will be closely monitored.

161
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:49,141
Why are you still not wearing the school uniform?

162
00:13:54,512 --> 00:13:56,338
I will wear it when I want to.

163
00:13:59,895 --> 00:14:03,677
Do you wear it because you want to or someone made you to?

164
00:14:04,461 --> 00:14:05,899
I’m willing to.

165
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:07,998
Nobody made me.

166
00:14:08,689 --> 00:14:09,770
You’re tame.

167
00:14:10,913 --> 00:14:13,788
No surprise you've been selected as The Prefect Club president

168
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:18,845
in this age when people don't believe in archaic and foolish rules.

169
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,555
Take that back!

170
00:14:20,974 --> 00:14:22,974
Suppalo rules are not foolish.

171
00:14:24,445 --> 00:14:27,200
Is the rule keeper breaking the rule by using violence against me now?

172
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:31,129
But I’m telling you.

173
00:14:31,772 --> 00:14:33,346
You punch me once.

174
00:14:34,548 --> 00:14:36,125
I kiss you once.

175
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:38,192
Want it?

176
00:14:45,124 --> 00:14:50,920
(All student prefects, please proceed to the Student Welfare Department immediately.)

177
00:14:53,566 --> 00:14:54,578
You get away this time.

178
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,630
If I didn’t get called, you’d get hurt.

179
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:01,375
What a shame.

180
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:03,470
You just missed a kiss from me.

181
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,002
What a jackass!

182
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:06,482
You’ll have to deal with me one day.

183
00:15:06,482 --> 00:15:07,418
Bring it on.

184
00:15:07,931 --> 00:15:09,070
Right here. Right now.

185
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:10,996
Shut up.

186
00:15:12,301 --> 00:15:13,933
Don’t you think I wouldn’t hit you.

187
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:19,997
I just love

188
00:15:20,634 --> 00:15:22,017
people who are cocky.

189
00:15:30,655 --> 00:15:31,388
Hey!

190
00:15:56,744 --> 00:15:57,709
Mr. Sit,

191
00:15:58,077 --> 00:16:02,605
can you please confirm if you did or did not put on the handbrake when parking the car?

192
00:16:03,889 --> 00:16:05,327
I’m not sure.

193
00:16:06,163 --> 00:16:09,344
I usually do it every time.

194
00:16:10,479 --> 00:16:14,028
Then you can’t confirm if you did.

195
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,189
Teacher.

196
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:18,445
Mr. Sit has been the school driver for over 10 years.

197
00:16:18,862 --> 00:16:21,695
Do you really think he forgot to put on the handbrake?

198
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:23,199
That’s right.

199
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:25,934
That’s possible.

200
00:16:30,484 --> 00:16:32,348
So it might be an accident.

201
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:33,645
Wait a minute, Teacher.

202
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:36,188
Isn’t it too fast to jump to that conclusion?

203
00:16:36,353 --> 00:16:38,237
Why don't you investigate thoroughly?

204
00:16:38,326 --> 00:16:40,675
Someone wants to hurt your students.

205
00:16:42,095 --> 00:16:43,611
No one is hurting anyone.

206
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:44,763
How do you know that?

207
00:16:45,064 --> 00:16:48,149
This isn’t the first something like this happens to us.

208
00:16:48,845 --> 00:16:50,070
It’s the curse.

209
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:54,912
You guys were causing trouble.

210
00:16:55,219 --> 00:16:56,677
That’s why the curse is back.

211
00:16:57,545 --> 00:16:58,945
Did you forget?

212
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:01,097
Every time the solar eclipse is near,

213
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:04,906
a curse falls upon Suppalo students who violate the rules.

214
00:17:05,027 --> 00:17:06,640
You’re a science program student.

215
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,647
How could you believe in such nonsense?

216
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,865
Teacher,

217
00:17:12,504 --> 00:17:14,236
this isn’t an accident.

218
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:15,963
Someone is behind this.

219
00:17:16,045 --> 00:17:18,238
You must catch the one who is responsible.

220
00:17:18,362 --> 00:17:19,587
Right.

221
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:22,077
You can’t let the issue go away.

222
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:24,148
Someone is behind it.

223
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:25,176
It’s an accident.

224
00:17:27,192 --> 00:17:30,664
There’s no way our school members would hurt each other.

225
00:17:31,565 --> 00:17:35,289
Don’t ever let me hear that accusation again.

226
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:37,120
Got it?

227
00:17:38,127 --> 00:17:39,354
Yes, sir.

228
00:17:51,345 --> 00:17:52,318
Did you see?

229
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,456
‘The World Remembers’ group is now affected by the curse.

230
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,570
You’re right.

231
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:59,553
The other day,

232
00:17:59,553 --> 00:18:02,740
a flower pot fell from the English teacher’s room, right next to them.

233
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:06,747
Luckily, they didn’t get hit.

234
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:10,448
And yesterday, a car with no driver almost hit them.

235
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:15,499
They say as the solar eclipse approaches, the curse becomes stronger.

236
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:31,631
Teacher Chadok,

237
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:34,267
did we really make a good judgment?

238
00:18:35,222 --> 00:18:36,048
Why?

239
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,418
If the students aren’t satisfied and digging into it themselves,

240
00:18:40,535 --> 00:18:41,898
what’s going to happen?

241
00:18:42,247 --> 00:18:43,325
Why don’t we…

242
00:18:43,325 --> 00:18:45,248
You’re an assistant to a student welfare teacher.

243
00:18:45,461 --> 00:18:46,571
You still lack experience.

244
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:48,216
Just do your job.

245
00:18:48,326 --> 00:18:49,692
Do not question.

246
00:18:50,099 --> 00:18:50,830
Understood?

247
00:18:53,123 --> 00:18:53,903
Yes.

248
00:19:11,587 --> 00:19:12,328
Take a seat.

249
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:20,816
Thank you.

250
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:28,808
Teacher Waree,

251
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,474
since I’m new here, may I ask you a question?

252
00:19:33,481 --> 00:19:34,152
Yes.

253
00:19:35,193 --> 00:19:37,005
Is the school curse real?

254
00:19:45,199 --> 00:19:48,516
I’m dealing with the accident yesterday.

255
00:19:48,923 --> 00:19:51,155
The students don’t believe it was an accident.

256
00:19:51,246 --> 00:19:52,090
So I think…

257
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,246
What did your boss say?

258
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:58,685
Teacher Chadok said we leave it as is.

259
00:20:01,252 --> 00:20:02,439
Trust him then.

260
00:20:04,318 --> 00:20:06,177
If you want to work here for long,

261
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,805
don’t get involved in anything that isn't your business.

262
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:15,186
Will you please excuse me?

263
00:20:34,038 --> 00:20:37,297
[So this is how the rule breakers are punished.]

264
00:20:46,234 --> 00:20:47,692
If we break the rules,

265
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,563
what will they do to us?

266
00:20:58,049 --> 00:20:58,915
Hey, newbie.

267
00:21:04,493 --> 00:21:05,627
Why are you here?

268
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:07,186
Why aren’t you in class?

269
00:21:09,065 --> 00:21:09,845
Just hanging out.

270
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:12,845
Is it against the rules to just hang out?

271
00:21:14,973 --> 00:21:17,089
He’s a real pain like you said.

272
00:21:18,629 --> 00:21:19,593
Believe me now?

273
00:21:20,174 --> 00:21:21,462
He’s such an ass.

274
00:21:22,036 --> 00:21:22,853
Give it back.

275
00:21:22,853 --> 00:21:23,920
Give me that.

276
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,162
I need to use it.

277
00:21:25,162 --> 00:21:26,223
Just follow the rules.

278
00:21:36,721 --> 00:21:38,217
Who sent you to mess with this school?

279
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:41,850
What are you doing?

280
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:43,473
Your pin tilts.

281
00:21:43,944 --> 00:21:45,344
It is not you at all.

282
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,117
Why are you here?

283
00:21:59,633 --> 00:22:00,862
Why aren’t you in class?

284
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:01,754
Give it back.

285
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:02,557
Give me that.

286
00:22:08,273 --> 00:22:09,181
Give it.

287
00:22:10,377 --> 00:22:13,222
Don’t you know it’s against the school rule to use a phone?

288
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:14,968
It’s mine. Give it back.

289
00:22:15,277 --> 00:22:17,198
Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

290
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:18,513
Or what?

291
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:20,364
I’m a student prefect.

292
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:22,600
But what you’re doing is like a thief.

293
00:22:22,754 --> 00:22:24,120
Not a prefect.

294
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:24,921
Give it back.

295
00:22:26,529 --> 00:22:28,013
Give it to me.

296
00:22:30,761 --> 00:22:31,601
Akk.

297
00:22:31,828 --> 00:22:32,988
Kan , Wat.

298
00:22:34,505 --> 00:22:36,400
You can collect it later at the student welfare department.

299
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,214
But I need to use it now.

300
00:22:38,214 --> 00:22:41,435
If you can’t follow the rules, you don’t deserve to be in this school.

301
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:44,170
Go back to class.

302
00:22:51,591 --> 00:22:53,509
You can’t pretend to be a prefect.

303
00:22:55,769 --> 00:22:56,490
That.

304
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:57,934
Where did you get that?

305
00:22:59,827 --> 00:23:01,621
I want to be a prefect.

306
00:23:02,703 --> 00:23:04,703
Accept me in your Prefect Club, please.

307
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:06,665
Please.

308
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:10,218
You registered but were not qualified.

309
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,370
Try to understand.

310
00:23:11,535 --> 00:23:13,186
But I can improve.

311
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,747
I’m trying to up my GPA to 3.

312
00:23:15,975 --> 00:23:17,810
And I’m working out hard.

313
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:20,758
Please include me.

314
00:23:22,233 --> 00:23:23,779
You can’t be.

315
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,356
Come on.

316
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:37,309
Hey!

317
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:40,659
Guys!

318
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,358
All right.

319
00:23:42,358 --> 00:23:43,976
That’s all for today.

320
00:23:44,224 --> 00:23:46,513
Don’t forget the assigned group report.

321
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:48,440
Yes, ma’am.

322
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,853
Students, say thank you.

323
00:23:51,942 --> 00:23:54,560
Thank you, Teacher.

324
00:24:01,272 --> 00:24:02,427
What a long day.

325
00:24:04,462 --> 00:24:05,148
Hey.

326
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,421
Are you okay?

327
00:24:07,390 --> 00:24:08,369
Are you sick?

328
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,885
I’m fine.

329
00:24:10,897 --> 00:24:12,600
You don’t need to get so close to me.

330
00:24:13,161 --> 00:24:14,666
I know.

331
00:24:18,413 --> 00:24:20,062
Don’t forget to gather the info.

332
00:24:20,201 --> 00:24:22,036
I’ll call and let you know when we’re doing it.

333
00:24:22,432 --> 00:24:23,937
My mom is here.

334
00:24:24,382 --> 00:24:25,024
Yes.

335
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:26,588
You’re so bossy.

336
00:24:27,156 --> 00:24:28,041
Just go.

337
00:24:31,381 --> 00:24:32,764
Don’t forget to search for the info.

338
00:24:32,764 --> 00:24:33,589
Yes.

339
00:24:36,687 --> 00:24:38,687
Well, well.

340
00:24:39,675 --> 00:24:40,933
Aren’t you going with your boyfriend?

341
00:24:40,933 --> 00:24:42,007
Boyfriend, my ass.

342
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,008
Do not tease me about that, Wat.

343
00:24:44,585 --> 00:24:45,569
People will misunderstand.

Okay.

346

Easy, man.

347
00:25:09,366 --> 00:25:10,148
Akk.

You already know about that.

362

That’s all the more reason not to join.

Unless you’re the one behind them, stirring things up.

It’s so outdated to think the protesters have someone backing them up.

Why don’t you think everyone has their brain and can think for themselves?

366
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:23,513
They have the right to question what’s not right.

367

If they can think, why don’t they think they should abide by the rules?

00:39:25,103 --> 00:39:27,645
That sounds nice but…

515
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:31,871
Aren’t you afraid of the Suppalo curse?

516
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:32,824
Come on!

517
00:39:32,824 --> 00:39:34,915
The curse isn’t real!

518
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:46,086
Shit!

519
00:39:46,204 --> 00:39:47,382
How did this happen?

520
00:39:50,002 --> 00:39:52,002
I told you.

521
00:39:52,002 --> 00:39:54,024
The curse is getting us.

522
00:39:57,548 --> 00:39:59,265
It’s scary.

523
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:03,966
How did you know about that?

524
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:06,280
It happened before you joined this school.

525
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:11,059
#SuppaloScaryStories is pretty well-known.

526
00:40:13,231 --> 00:40:15,231
But I don’t believe it’s the curse.

527
00:40:15,869 --> 00:40:16,903
Why?

528
00:40:17,385 --> 00:40:20,044
A plant doesn’t have hands. it can't move itself.

529
00:40:22,283 --> 00:40:23,859
Someone did it for sure.

530
00:40:27,067 --> 00:40:28,831
Your school sucks.

531
00:40:31,094 --> 00:40:33,751
If you hate it here, why did you join?

532
00:40:36,285 --> 00:40:37,955
You get mad so easily.

533
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,260
Seriously, what did the school members ever do to you?

534
00:40:41,632 --> 00:40:43,031
What did we do to you?

535
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,400
Why are you ruining our reputation?

536
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,284
Mr. Sit.

537
00:41:09,273 --> 00:41:10,359
Hey.

538
00:41:11,128 --> 00:41:11,932
Can I help you?

539
00:41:14,005 --> 00:41:18,687
Did you know Mr. Dika, an English teacher who used to teach here?

540
00:41:22,491 --> 00:41:24,491
I just transferred from Parot.

541
00:41:27,868 --> 00:41:28,519
Yes.

542
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:30,951
What a shame.

543
00:41:31,069 --> 00:41:32,015
He’s a good teacher.

544
00:41:32,227 --> 00:41:33,893
He shouldn’t have been bought somewhere else.

545
00:41:35,291 --> 00:41:37,362
Why do you think he's bought?

546
00:41:37,802 --> 00:41:39,260
I heard the rumor.

547
00:41:39,864 --> 00:41:41,416
He’s a great teacher.

548
00:41:41,808 --> 00:41:42,803
A great employee.

549
00:41:43,311 --> 00:41:45,965
When he was an assistant in the student welfare department,

550
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:53,728
Teacher Chadok was so harsh on him,

551
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:58,242
After that, they were on good terms for a while.

552
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:02,108
Then he suddenly quit.

553
00:42:09,377 --> 00:42:12,107
Teacher Dika was an assistant in the student welfare department?

554
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:37,748
If you hate it here, why did you join?

555
00:42:40,481 --> 00:42:42,269
You’ve been following me everywhere.

556
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:47,090
Do you like me, prefectly?

557
00:42:56,665 --> 00:43:00,479
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

558
00:43:00,674 --> 00:43:02,674
I know you came to mess with my school.

559
00:43:02,674 --> 00:43:05,153
But your method isn’t working on me.

560
00:43:10,414 --> 00:43:11,707
What’s wrong, Big Foot?

561
00:43:12,132 --> 00:43:13,271
You’re tense.

562
00:43:13,916 --> 00:43:15,951
What can be a problem if you’re close to me?

563
00:43:15,951 --> 00:43:17,009
You want it now, Shortstop?

564
00:43:17,009 --> 00:43:18,105
Sure, Big Foot.

565
00:43:18,105 --> 00:43:20,105
I can go to your room right now.

566
00:43:20,245 --> 00:43:23,093
Next time, you don’t have to protect me.

567
00:43:23,187 --> 00:43:25,039
I don’t want to see you get hurt like that again.

568
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:26,144
Do you want to be my boyfriend?
