There you go, Mr. Hazel wood.

26
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,916
You've landed in quite
a lovely spot, haven't you?

27
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,833
And with a view of the sea.

28
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,083
- Are you a nurse?
- Oh.

29
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:53,666
Teacher.

30
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,666
I-I mean, I-I was. I'm...

31
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,291
I'm retired.

32
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,166
Pamela will be here every day
to bathe and exercise him.

33
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,375
I'll be around twice a week
to check his observations

34
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:08,958
and adjust his medication.

35
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:10,441
But you'll have charge of his meals

36
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,708
and anything else that comes up
while we're not here.

37
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,500
- I understand.
- And he can feed himself,

38
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,541
though he sometimes makes a mess of it.

39
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,145
And you have to watch for him choking.

40
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,017
- That's from the dysphagia...
- Difficulty in swallowing.

41
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:22,916
I'm to cut his food
into small pieces or puree it

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,916
and make sure he drinks
a sufficient amount of water.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,583
I've been reading up about it.

44
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,083
Well, you deserve a gold star, don't you?

45
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:33,083
This is Mr. Hazelwood's personal items.

46
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:35,791
They came to the hospital
after he sold the house.

47
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,416
Is there anything else I should know?

48
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,541
Oh. No cigarettes.

49
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,208
He will try and get one out of you.

50
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,583
Oh, we don't keep them in the house.

51
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,375
Run, Bobby! Bobby!

52
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,708
What's this about?

53
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,833
I thought he was staying
in the spare room.

54
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,125
He's not a prisoner.

55
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:42,708
This is my home.

56
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,125
Isn't it?

57
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,583
For God's sake, Marion,
I can only stand so much.

58
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,791
There are places for invalids.

59
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,791
Have you been inside any of those places?

60
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:05,416
- Besides, you agreed.
- Well...

61
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,791
You wouldn't give me any rest until I did.

62
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,875
Seemed the right thing to do.

63
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,916
Don't fool yourself.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,625
You know why you brought him here.

65
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,875
Why?

66
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,125
To punish him.

67
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,041
That's ridiculous.

68
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,750
You waiting on him hand and foot,
that's ridiculous.

69
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:11,541
Here is an interesting bit

70
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,541
in the Arts section.

71
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,250
A young woman has been short-listed

72
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:21,958
for the Turner Prize

73
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:24,041
with a piece called My Bed.

74
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,875
That's exactly what it is.

75
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,958
Unmade no less.

76
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,000
Apparently, everyone's talking about it.

77
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,083
I'd like to see it.

78
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:46,333
You were the one
who taught me to look at art.

79
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:47,750
Do you remember?

80
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,333
Ohk.

81
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,666
I don't...

82
00:07:56,166 --> 00:07:57,750
Ohk.

83
00:07:57,833 --> 00:07:59,666
I can't understand.

84
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:02,291
Sm.

85
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,750
Ohk.

86
00:08:03,833 --> 00:08:05,083
You want to smoke.

87
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:08,791
Nigel says you can't.

88
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,333
You've had a stroke.

89
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:13,166
It could cause you to have another.

90
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,166
- Eeev.
- Patrick.

91
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,291
I absolutely cannot allow you...

92
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,875
Eeev!

93
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,666

94
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:27,958

113
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:02,642

Yes.

117
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:20,000
Almost didn't recognize you.

00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:23,291
Been a while since
you came around to the house.

119
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,041
I've been at teacher training college.

120
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:27,083
Yeah, Sylvie said.

121
00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:29,916
And you were stationed...?

122
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,791

00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,041
- I was thinking.
- Yes?

155
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,666
You being a teacher,
you must be a bit of a bookworm.

156

Well, I don't know how to take that.

You see, I'm not much of a reader.

160

Oh?

161
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:10,541
But I think a man ought to try

162

I agree with you there.

163

Do you think you could
recommend some books to me?

164
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,375
In exchange,

165
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:18,500
I could give you more swimming lessons.

166
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,250
Yes, I'd be happy to recommend books.

167
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,416
Smashing.

168
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,416
What about art?

169
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,208
You mean books about art?

170
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,708
I never really looked at art before.

171
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,541
Now I think I could
get something out of it.

172
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,291
Well, that's a start.

173
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:40,291
Did you have
any particular artist in mind?

174
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:42,750
Mm.

175
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:46,541
Is there a painter named Turner?

176
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,541
That would be J.M.W. Turner. Yes.

177
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:07,875

178

189
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,833
Thank you. Thank you.

190
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,041
Hey, no. No, no, no, no.

191
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,750
Not today, boy. Not today. Hey, no.

192
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:19,041
Hey. Good boy. Good boy.

193
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,916
Oh. Ahoy.

194
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:49,250
What the devil do you think you're doing?

195
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,583
Give me that.

196
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:53,250
Patrick. Stop.

197
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,583
Ow!

198
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:59,375
You could start a fire.

199
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,833
Where's Tom?

200
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:06,000
- What?
- Where's Tom?

201
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,666
- Where's Tom?
- Mm.

202
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,083
Oh, he's...

203
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,250
He's walking Bobby.

204
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:15,125
- No.
- Well, he-he's swimming.

205
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:18,250
- No!
- He doesn't want to see you.

206
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,958
He...

207
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,625
He won't even come near your room.

208
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,708
Well, I don't think he'll ever forgive me
for bringing you here.

209
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,791
Bloody mess.

210
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,708
The museum?

211
00:15:41,791 --> 00:15:43,750
I'm sure you've been here before.

212
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,041
Well, yes.

213
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,333
But have you ever had a personal tour

214
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,000
from the director
of the Western Art Galleries?

215
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,250
No.

216
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,517
- How did you...
- He was a witness

217
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:54,916
to an accident on my watch.

218
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,333
Nothing serious, but we got talking,

219
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,500
and he invited me for a private tour.

220
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,583
And I thought, "Marion would enjoy
that sort of thing more than me."

221
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:06,041
Notice the light...

222
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:09,416
striking the crest of the crashing waves.

223
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:14,875
You feel they could crush you
or take you under.

224
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:35,041
Blake's trying to startle the senses
as well as the spirit.

225
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,125
There's so much passion in his work.

226
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,291
You just...

227
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,250
have to let it take hold of you.

228
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,708
Now, this is one of my favorite paintings.

229
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:03,458
Raising of Lazarus by Jan Lievens.

230
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,458
He was a contemporary of Rembrandt.

231
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,041
Astonishing.

232
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,500
Exactly.

233
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,166
Thanks ever so much.

234
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,625
It's been splendid.

235
00:17:17,708 --> 00:17:21,125
Oh, I don't know if you're free Friday,
but I have tickets to a recital.

236
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:22,708
Why don't the two of you join me?

237
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,541
Never been to a recital.

238
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:26,875
But it's up to Marion.

239
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,041
Um, of course.

240
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,375
Well, I'll see you then. 7:00.

241
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,041
Thank you.

242
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,500
So kind of him to invite us.

243
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,708
I'll be sorry to miss
our library visit, though.

244
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,708
Don't you want to go? I could tell him.

245
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,666
No. No. It would hurt his feelings.

246
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:49,375
He can't have many friends
his own age if he's invited us.

247
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:54,333
I think he's taken with you, that's all.

248
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,125
Don't be silly.

249
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,875
I love this wine!

250
00:18:42,958 --> 00:18:44,041
It reminds me of Rome.

251
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:45,601
Have you traveled a great deal?

252
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,916
Well, the museum sends me to Italy
now and then to collect new pieces,

253
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,625
and I always try to take
a few days for myself

254
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,750
- and have an adventure.
- Mm.

255
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,291
How about you?

256
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:57,625
I've never had the opportunity.
I don't know when I will.

257
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,666
Oh, but you must dream, Marion.

258
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,916
Nothing happens
unless you dream of it first.

259
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,625
Dream, Marion. Go on.

260
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:07,541
I suppose it would have to be Venice.

261
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,666
Ah, you're a romantic.

262
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,583
Um, I don't know.

263
00:19:12,666 --> 00:19:17,125
I imagine Venice to be like
something out of another world.

264
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,791
That it is.

265
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,875
Personally, I'd love to see Mother Russia.

266
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,017
It's the setting of my favorite novel,
Anna Karenina.

267
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,416
I haven't read it.

268
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,833
Oh, you must!

269
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,809
It's literature's most tragic love story.

270
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:32,083
And the most true, because all
love stories are tragic, aren't they?

271
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,291
I hope not.

272
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,208
Let's have a toast.

273
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,708
- To Marion.
- No.

274
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:42,041
To all of us.

275
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,309
- To all of us.
- To all of us.

276
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,375
- All of us.
- Cheers. Cheers!

I'm giving you your bath.

290
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,916
She doesn't come again before Friday.

291
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,041
You need a bath.

292
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:51,708
Believe me,

293
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:55,291
I'm not any happier about it than you are.

294
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,708
You'll get one of these after,
if you behave.

295
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:30,750
Rather beautiful dome shape above,

296
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,125
which is very typical
of Indian architecture.

297
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,250
Peaceful, isn't it?

298
00:21:38,125 --> 00:21:40,916
It was built to commemorate
the many brave Indian soldiers

299
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,250
during the Great War.

300
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:48,250
It's made entirely of Italian marble.

301
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,708
Shipped over from Sicily.

302
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,375
Do you mind if I join you?

303
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
We went to the opera.

304
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,041
Verdi.

305
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:45,083
It was beautiful.

306
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:47,000
And you were Patrick's guests again?

307
00:23:48,458 --> 00:23:52,500
Well, he heard that
I'd always dreamed of going,

308
00:23:52,583 --> 00:23:54,583
so he insisted.

309
00:23:56,583 --> 00:23:57,708
What?

310
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:01,041
How long have you and Tom
known each other?

311
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,250
Since the summer.

312
00:24:03,333 --> 00:24:05,000
Hmm.

313
00:24:05,083 --> 00:24:07,000
And has he made advances?

314
00:24:07,083 --> 00:24:09,083
Tom's a gentleman.

315
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:10,375
What are you getting at?

316
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:12,416
Well, it's just...

317
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:16,666
The three of you
spending so much time together.

318
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:18,500
Tom's not jealous?

319
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,583
Why should he be?

320
00:24:20,666 --> 00:24:23,291
Well, you and this Patrick seem
better suited to each other.

321
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,625
So many similar interests.

322
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:28,208
Are you sure it's Tom you want to be with?

323
00:24:28,291 --> 00:24:31,958
Well, I must admit, Patrick is dashing.

324
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:34,791
- But...
- But?

325
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,666
With Tom, I don't care about

326
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:41,416
education or grammar or manners.

327
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
When he burps when he drinks his beer

328
00:24:43,583 --> 00:24:46,333
Or falls asleep
at the opera, which he did.

329
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:49,791
And it annoyed Patrick to no end.

330
00:24:49,875 --> 00:24:52,583
With all of that,

331
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:54,708
he's just perfect.

332
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,291
He's Tom.

333
00:24:58,333 --> 00:25:00,666
Does that answer your question?

334
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:03,291
Well, I think you're saying
you're in love.

335
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,041
And Tom?

336
00:25:10,416 --> 00:25:12,000
Well, you'll be happy to hear

337
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:14,333
that we are seeing each other
this weekend.

338
00:25:14,416 --> 00:25:15,625
Just the two of us.

339
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:20,416
Your idea?

340
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,791
His.

341
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:27,416
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la ♪

342
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,416
♪ La, la, la, la, la, la, la... ♪

343
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,000
Do you want another?

344
00:25:33,083 --> 00:25:35,250
I've barely touched this one.

345
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,916
Right.

346
00:25:39,958 --> 00:25:41,541
How's Sylvie?

347
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,541
Same.

348
00:25:44,625 --> 00:25:45,875
Are you all right?

349
00:25:50,416 --> 00:25:52,416
Let's go. We can't talk in here.

350
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,833
Now get out! Get out!

351
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,416
What the hell is wrong with you?

352
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,375
- What?
- Why can't we have a drink like a normal couple?

353
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,958
Or dance?

354
00:26:13,458 --> 00:26:15,916
I want to take you somewhere.

355
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,958
All right?

356
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,708
Can I get you a drink?

357
00:26:30,791 --> 00:26:33,291
What would you like?

358
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,416
Whiskey?

359
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,166
Cognac?

360
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,750
Brandy?

361
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,583
Is this Patrick's flat?

362
00:26:42,666 --> 00:26:44,083
Yeah.

363
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:46,833
He's in London.

364
00:26:46,916 --> 00:26:49,291
Gave me a set of keys
so I can use it when he's away.

365
00:26:49,375 --> 00:26:51,875
You said you wanted...?

366
00:26:51,958 --> 00:26:53,875
Whiskey, please.

367
00:26:56,333 --> 00:26:58,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

368
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,958
Is this you?

369
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,500
It's good, isn't it?

370
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:13,625
Patrick says ordinary people
have the best faces.

371
00:27:16,875 --> 00:27:18,208
Did you pose for this?

372
00:27:18,291 --> 00:27:20,125
That's how Patrick and I met.

373
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,375
I told you.

374
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:24,375
No, you said it was reporting an accident.

375
00:27:26,291 --> 00:27:29,291
I haven't finished the tour. Come on.

376
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:54,458
I wanted it to be nice for you.

377
00:27:54,541 --> 00:27:56,541
This is nice.

378
00:27:58,083 --> 00:28:00,083
I wanted to tell you...

379
00:28:01,916 --> 00:28:03,916
...ask you a question, really.

380
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,791
Something that's hard to say.

381
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,416
Just try.

382
00:28:13,583 --> 00:28:15,458
I want you to be my wife.

383
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:21,017
I-I'm not good at this sort of thing.

384
00:28:21,041 --> 00:28:22,583
I wasn't sure you even...

385
00:28:22,666 --> 00:28:27,000
I never tried anything before
because I think I was afraid.

386
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:29,166
Of me?

387
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,625
Of growing up.

388
00:28:31,708 --> 00:28:33,750
When a man gets married, it's a big step.

389
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,916
And you seemed so taken with Patrick, I...

390
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,708
No, that's not true, Tom.
That's not true at all.

391
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:42,791
I just...

392
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:46,708
I didn't think you were
interested in me. That's all.

393
00:28:47,791 --> 00:28:49,471
We're just two confused people, aren't we?

394
00:28:50,416 --> 00:28:52,291
Looks that way.

395
00:28:55,625 --> 00:28:57,208
Will you think about it?

396
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:02,125
Very lucky.

397
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:03,875
I'm on a roll.

398
00:29:18,416 --> 00:29:20,000
It's time for his pills.

399
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:30,916
He spoke today.

400
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,708
Do you want to know what he said?

401
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:34,166
Not particularly.

402
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,125
"Where's Tom?"

403
00:29:40,166 --> 00:29:42,291
That's what he asked.

404
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:43,791
Christ Almighty, Marion.

405
00:29:43,875 --> 00:29:45,041
What do you want from me?

406
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:48,291
All the time he's been here,
you haven't been to see him once.

407
00:29:48,375 --> 00:29:49,750
And I don't plan to.

408
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:53,083
If he upsets you so much,
you should just send him away.

409
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,517
- You don't mean that.
- I do.

410
00:29:54,541 --> 00:29:56,041
I said it from the beginning.

411
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,833
We owe him something after what happened.

412
00:29:57,916 --> 00:29:59,916
Just leave it alone.
We settled it a long time ago.

413
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,166
No. We didn't.

414
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,708
We didn't settle it.

415
00:30:02,791 --> 00:30:04,125
We just stopped talking about it.

416
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,916
I don't want to hear another word.

417
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,041
Are we playing or not?

418
00:30:09,125 --> 00:30:10,416
How did this happen?!

419
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:12,416
Bloody hell.

420
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,976
I was supposed to be married with
all the good things that come with that.

421
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,416
Now look-look at me.

422
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:19,333
There's no passion.

423
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:24,750
Everything was fine
until you brought him here.

424
00:30:24,833 --> 00:30:27,208
Things haven't been fine
for quite a while,

425
00:30:27,291 --> 00:30:29,500
and if we don't try
to fix it or at least...

426
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:30,916
Wh-Where are you going?

427
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,666
- The pub for some peace.
- And-and what do I do, Tom?

428
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,500
How do I find some peace?

429
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,750
- Send him away.
- No!

430
00:30:36,833 --> 00:30:39,541
You want him gone, you do it.

431
00:31:55,291 --> 00:31:58,375
29th of July, 1957.

432
00:32:02,208 --> 00:32:03,708
- Yes?
- There's been an accident.

433
00:32:03,791 --> 00:32:06,208
An old lady on her bicycle.
Could you come quickly, please?

434
00:32:10,333 --> 00:32:12,041
Finding a policeman

435
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:14,958
was not something I ever thought
I would have to do.

436
00:32:16,416 --> 00:32:18,500
What the devil?

437
00:32:18,583 --> 00:32:20,541
She didn't want to wait for you.

438
00:32:20,625 --> 00:32:23,500
Says she hates bloody coppers.

439
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,958
Not the first time I've heard that.

440
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:30,041
Not much of an accident, was it?

441
00:32:31,208 --> 00:32:32,875
I'm terribly sorry to have bothered you.

442
00:32:32,958 --> 00:32:34,666
Oh, no bother at all, sir.

443
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,541
You did the right thing.

444
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:39,291
Besides, you never know
how these things will turn out.

445
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,833
Thank you. Mister...?

446
00:32:41,916 --> 00:32:43,250
Hazel wood.

447
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:44,458
Officer Burgess.

448
00:32:44,541 --> 00:32:47,333
Let me give you my card.

449
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,250
I've never had much patience

450
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,916
with our boys in blue.

451
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,833
I've always despised
their brutish little ways.

452
00:32:56,916 --> 00:32:59,041
The evaluating glance up and down.

453
00:32:59,125 --> 00:33:02,125
The distaste they cannot hide.

454
00:33:03,875 --> 00:33:06,500
But this boy is different.

455
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,041
His eyes lit up when he saw my card.

456
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:11,458
You work at the museum?

457
00:33:11,541 --> 00:33:14,625
Said he'd never been
to Brighton's most noble institution,

458
00:33:14,708 --> 00:33:16,625
even on a school trip.

459
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,041
I had the measles.

460
00:33:18,125 --> 00:33:20,250
Oh, dear.

461
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:23,000
I invited him
to visit the museum as my guest.

462
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,291
You're welcome.

463
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:26,000
He seemed interested.

464
00:33:28,083 --> 00:33:30,500
I haven't been able
to stop thinking about him.

465
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,958
He's handsome, yes.

466
00:33:34,041 --> 00:33:35,791
But there's something else.

467
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:40,625
Innocence combined with a curiosity.

468
00:33:42,833 --> 00:33:47,250
I'd like to draw him,
but I wonder if he'd misunderstand.

469
00:33:49,958 --> 00:33:52,666
I'd almost forgotten that
some people are still innocent.

470
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:54,833
- Mr. Hazel wood.
- Mm-hmm.

471
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:57,291
An officer's here asking for you.

472
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:02,625
Tell him he'll have to wait.

473
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:06,250
He's rather handsome for a copper.

474
00:34:12,958 --> 00:34:14,958
There he was.

475
00:34:17,041 --> 00:34:19,250
I recognized him even from behind.

476
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:25,125
That fine head.

477
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,916
The unmistakable line of his shoulder.

478
00:34:39,625 --> 00:34:41,625
Now, that's a good painting.

479
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:44,458
In fact, it's a masterpiece.

480
00:34:47,083 --> 00:34:50,666
See? I must have
some taste for art after all.

481
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:56,291
Taste is simply just knowing
how something makes you feel.

482
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,416
So how does it make you feel?

483
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,458
You can sense the waves.

484
00:35:07,916 --> 00:35:09,541
You know, how strong they are.

485
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:11,583
Like swimming in rough surf.

486
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:15,500
- Exciting.
- Mm.

487
00:35:18,375 --> 00:35:19,958
And frightening.

488
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:22,250
Right.

489
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,356
Don't tell the boys down the station
I'm afraid of a painting.

490
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:37,291
You know, I'm an amateur artist.

491
00:35:38,666 --> 00:35:39,791
You paint?

492
00:35:39,875 --> 00:35:42,500
Pencil drawings mostly.

493
00:35:42,583 --> 00:35:44,333
Studies of ordinary Brighton people,

494
00:35:44,416 --> 00:35:47,083
a tram conductor, a barman,
that sort of thing.

495
00:35:49,583 --> 00:35:51,333
You'd make a perfect subject.

496
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:52,916
Me?

497
00:35:54,291 --> 00:35:56,000
Never been asked to model before.

498
00:35:56,083 --> 00:35:58,083
Oh, there's nothing to it.

499
00:36:01,875 --> 00:36:04,625
But I wouldn't mind
learning more about paintings.

500
00:36:06,083 --> 00:36:07,666
Art, I mean.

501
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,958
Well, that's admirable.

502
00:36:11,041 --> 00:36:13,000
Is it? Why?

503
00:36:14,416 --> 00:36:17,750
Because a man should always
try to improve himself.

504
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,916
I made it.

505
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,416
Evening, Patrick.

506
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,833
Rudy.

507
00:37:37,916 --> 00:37:40,333
This is Tom, my cousin.

508
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:41,958
How do you do?

509
00:37:42,041 --> 00:37:43,625
Fine, thank you.

510
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,375
Cousin?

511
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,250
I assumed you didn't want me to say that

512
00:37:53,333 --> 00:37:55,958
you're a police officer coming
to have your portrait drawn.

513
00:37:57,708 --> 00:37:59,583
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

514
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:09,666
- Nice place.
- Thank you.

515
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:12,583
I brought my uniform,

516
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,666
in case you want me in it
for the portrait.

517
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:17,000
Yes, yes. That will do nicely.

518
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:24,916
Well, then, why don't, uh... you change.

519
00:39:03,208 --> 00:39:05,083
Do you like being a policeman?

520
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:08,791
- Yeah, I think so.
- Try to keep the pose.

521
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:09,916
Oh. Sorry.

522
00:39:11,458 --> 00:39:13,458
I think so.

523
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:15,333
What do you like about it?

524
00:39:17,166 --> 00:39:19,083
Is this part of the procedure?

525
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:22,458
I can't draw you
if I don't know who you are.

526
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:23,791
Right.

527
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:27,583
Um...

528
00:39:29,416 --> 00:39:32,750
I like knowing I'm doing
something for the public.

529
00:39:32,833 --> 00:39:34,541
You know, protecting people.

530
00:39:37,916 --> 00:39:40,041
If that's your ambition,
I give you more credit

531
00:39:40,125 --> 00:39:41,625
than most of your colleagues.

532
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,041
How so?

533
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,333
You seem more...

534
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:53,333
...open-minded than
the police I've run across.

535
00:39:54,666 --> 00:39:57,000
- Do I?
- Oh, yes.

536
00:39:57,083 --> 00:40:00,208
I tend to keep my distance
from the police in general.

537
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:04,000
There's no reason to fear a police officer
if you stay on the right side of the law.

538
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:06,125
Of course. I-I...

539
00:40:06,208 --> 00:40:08,059
It's the criminal element
that causes the trouble.

540
00:40:08,083 --> 00:40:10,333
We just have to deal with it.

541
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,736
I don't know if this is a good...

542
00:40:11,791 --> 00:40:14,000
I haven't offered you a drink.
Would you like something?

543
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,500
Um...

544
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:20,166
Please, beer if you've got it.

545
00:40:20,250 --> 00:40:23,208
Don't have any beer. Uh...

546
00:40:23,291 --> 00:40:24,451
How about something stronger?

547
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,416
I'm going to have a Scotch.

548
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:31,833
How about you, Officer Burgess?

549
00:40:33,375 --> 00:40:35,916
Scotch. Thank you.

550
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,833
And it's Tom.

551
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,166
Tom.

552
00:40:46,708 --> 00:40:50,125
Oi! Stop where you are,
you bloody hooligan.

553
00:40:50,208 --> 00:40:51,750
What? What? Am I that ridiculous?

554
00:40:51,833 --> 00:40:53,291
I'm sorry, but "hooligan"?

555
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:56,708
All right.

556
00:40:56,791 --> 00:40:59,500
I'm no, I'm no bobby. Mm.

557
00:40:59,583 --> 00:41:02,291
- Well, this-this looks better on you anyway.
- Mm.

558
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:07,416
- And the material's coarse.
- Yeah, like me.

559
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,541
No, not at all like you.

560
00:41:24,708 --> 00:41:27,000
Do I make a good subject, then?

561
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:32,291
Despite your nervousness...

562
00:41:32,375 --> 00:41:34,375
Yes, yes.

563
00:41:35,458 --> 00:41:37,166
Well, the Scotch helped.

564
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,642
Don't know if I needed
three of them, though.

565
00:41:38,666 --> 00:41:40,791
You must think I'm a drunkard.

566
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:44,666
Oh, why shouldn't a police officer
enjoy himself when he's off duty?

567
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,083
- Absolutely right.
- Mm-hmm.

568
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:53,875
Are you really

569
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:55,708
going to hang my portrait in the museum?

570
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,875
Well...

571
00:42:00,958 --> 00:42:03,875
someday...

572
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:06,500
I hope to mount a show.

573
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,708
Imagine.

574
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:14,750
My face in a museum.

575
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:19,166
Really think it'll be good enough?

576
00:42:20,208 --> 00:42:22,166
I think it will be...

577
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:33,875
...lovely.

578
00:42:47,416 --> 00:42:48,541
Sorry.

579
00:42:49,583 --> 00:42:51,291
There's no need to be.

580
00:43:08,625 --> 00:43:11,458
I don't know what's happening.

581
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:22,791
- Patrick, I'm not...
- Don't say anything.

582
00:43:34,416 --> 00:43:36,625
Maybe we shouldn't.

583
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,041
All right?

584
00:45:01,458 --> 00:45:03,208
Tom?

585
00:45:03,291 --> 00:45:05,491
Will you check the door,
make sure there's nobody there?

586
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:19,666
There's no one there.

587
00:45:21,666 --> 00:45:23,916
How do you do it?

588
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,458
Do what?

589
00:45:27,708 --> 00:45:29,333
Live this life.

590
00:45:32,083 --> 00:45:34,208
One learns to live as one can.

591
00:45:35,375 --> 00:45:36,750
I can't.

592
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:54,291
It's hell being alone.

593
00:45:56,708 --> 00:45:59,666
I don't know whether I'll ever
see my policeman again.

594
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:04,750
These are wretched times we live in.

595
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:10,291
When one has to scurry underground
like a criminal...

596
00:46:12,458 --> 00:46:14,458
...just to drown one's sorrows.

597
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:20,458
Thankfully, that's why places
like the Argyle exist.

598
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,250
Hello, Patrick.

599
00:46:37,333 --> 00:46:39,291
How are we this evening?

600
00:46:39,375 --> 00:46:41,708
Oh, tolerable, Miss Brown.

601
00:46:41,791 --> 00:46:43,500
Oh, like myself.

602
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:45,000
Scotch as usual?

603
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:54,583
What are you having?

604
00:47:05,958 --> 00:47:07,875
A dry martini.

605
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,750
Dry martinis, please.

606
00:47:10,833 --> 00:47:12,583
For each of us.

607
00:47:31,291 --> 00:47:33,166
Oi!

608
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:34,434
Stop right there!

609
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:36,666
Stop there!

610
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:38,416
Fucking queers.

611
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,333
How disgusting.

612
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:50,000
Get up.

613
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,541
You're under arrest.

614
00:48:23,458 --> 00:48:25,458
I don't know why...

615
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:54,541
You still want to draw me?

616
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:58,250
If you like.

617
00:49:00,208 --> 00:49:02,083
If I like?

618
00:49:04,750 --> 00:49:06,625
I thought that's what you wanted.

619
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:11,625
To draw my portrait, an ordinary person.

620
00:49:15,458 --> 00:49:17,333
That's not what you wanted, is it?

621
00:49:17,416 --> 00:49:18,833
You're drunk.

622
00:49:18,916 --> 00:49:20,791
You got me here under false pretenses.

623
00:49:20,875 --> 00:49:22,392
You knew what you wanted the whole time!

624
00:49:22,416 --> 00:49:24,666
That's why you asked me here, isn't it?!

625
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:30,791
- Answer me!
- Hit me! Hit me! Go on.

626
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:39,061
You shouldn't have dragged me into it.

627
00:49:39,125 --> 00:49:40,875
You touched me first.

628
00:49:45,333 --> 00:49:48,000
I shouldn't have done that. It was wrong.

629
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,041
Did it feel wrong?

630
00:50:00,208 --> 00:50:01,958
Please...

631
00:50:04,875 --> 00:50:06,291
...don't.

632
00:52:31,375 --> 00:52:33,541
Did you ever think about getting married?

633
00:52:37,166 --> 00:52:38,833
I had a lover.

634
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,166
Michael.

635
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,083
And we were together five years.

636
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,916
What happened?

637
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,541
A gang of thugs beat him to death.

638
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:03,833
Bloody hell.

639
00:53:08,083 --> 00:53:10,041
How do you stand being alone?

640
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,083
I'm not alone, am I?

641
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,375
We have to be careful.

667

What? There's... no one for miles.

668
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,500
You can afford to break the rules.

669
00:55:48,583 --> 00:55:50,208
I can't.

670
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:11,250
For a policeman, that's very romantic.

671
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:17,125
I better tell you.

672
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:20,708
I'm planning on getting married.

673
00:56:25,416 --> 00:56:26,750
I see.

674
00:56:28,291 --> 00:56:30,958
- A man ought to be married.
- Well, not all men.

675
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:36,166
The other day, I was called in
to see the sergeant.

676
00:56:36,250 --> 00:56:38,916
He told me I was doing well.

677
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,041
And then he said, "I should warn you,

678
00:56:43,125 --> 00:56:46,708
some bachelors have found it hard
to rise through this division."

679
00:56:50,416 --> 00:56:53,166
Do you think that's fair?

680
00:56:53,250 --> 00:56:55,958
To the girl, I mean.

681
00:56:56,041 --> 00:56:59,125
- What?
- Well, marrying her for...

682
00:56:59,208 --> 00:57:01,583
well, I call it for protection.

683
00:57:01,666 --> 00:57:04,291
That's not the only reason.

684
00:57:04,375 --> 00:57:06,583
I'm fond of her.

685
00:57:06,666 --> 00:57:08,875
And someday I hope to have children.

686
00:57:17,750 --> 00:57:19,208
No.

687
00:57:23,541 --> 00:57:25,916
Are you saying goodbye to me?

688
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:28,041
No. I don't...

689
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:29,791
Do you want me to stop?

690
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:31,541
No.

691
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:33,083
Then what shall we do?

692
00:57:34,208 --> 00:57:36,166
Can you share me?

693
00:57:39,083 --> 00:57:40,875
If that's what it takes.

694
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:57,500
Bobby.

695
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:59,125
Here you go, boy.

696
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,750
Good boy.

697
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:53,559
It was a sweet ceremony.

698
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:55,041
- Just perfect.
- Really?

699
00:58:56,291 --> 00:58:59,125
And the two of you are
the handsomest couple I've ever seen.

700
00:59:00,375 --> 00:59:02,416
Patrick bought Tom that suit.

701
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,260
I don't think we'll ever
see him in it again.

702
00:59:04,291 --> 00:59:06,375
He thinks he looks silly.

703
00:59:10,708 --> 00:59:12,541
- I couldn't be happier for you.
- Thank you.

704
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:14,625
Oh.

705
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:19,458
Apparently, I've been drafted
to make a toast.

706
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:20,958
So where's our lovely bride?

707
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,541
Now, here is to Tom and Marion,

708
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:31,750
the perfect civilized couple.

709
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:34,791
Mr. and Mrs. Burgess.

710
00:59:35,791 --> 00:59:37,875
Mr. and Mrs. Burgess!

711
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:40,166
Uh, Tom, I think
you're meant to kiss the bride.

712
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:20,250
You look nice.

713
01:00:20,333 --> 01:00:22,375
Thank you.

714
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:56,000
Should we turn the light out?

715
01:00:56,083 --> 01:00:58,166
Yeah.

716
01:01:57,958 --> 01:01:59,750
I'm sorry.

717
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,541
Was it all right?

718
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,333
Yes, Tom.

719
01:02:39,416 --> 01:02:41,041
I'll be better next time.

720
01:02:43,000 --> 01:02:44,583
It was lovely.

721
01:03:03,916 --> 01:03:06,125
I've got a present for you.

722
01:03:06,208 --> 01:03:07,708
What?

723
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,680
Oh, my God! Tom!

724
01:03:15,541 --> 01:03:16,958
- Oh.
- Oh.

725
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:22,583
You should've seen your face.

726
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,708
Hello.

727
01:03:37,791 --> 01:03:39,291
Here I am, just as promised.

728
01:03:39,375 --> 01:03:41,083
Tom, help me with all of this, would you?

729
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:42,458
Patrick?

730
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:46,416
I promised to cook you
a fabulous wedding feast.

731
01:03:48,166 --> 01:03:50,250
Didn't Tom tell you?

732
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:51,625
No.

733
01:03:51,708 --> 01:03:53,208
I'm sure I did.

734
01:03:53,291 --> 01:03:55,083
Just for tonight.

735
01:03:55,166 --> 01:03:57,208
Then I'll be out of your hair.

736
01:03:59,708 --> 01:04:01,083
You look so happy, my dear.

737
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,250
I am.

738
01:04:33,541 --> 01:04:36,625
Patrick's a terrific cook, isn't he?

739
01:04:36,708 --> 01:04:37,875
I'm quite impressed.

740
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:39,559
- Beef bourguignon.
- I'll give you the recipe.

741
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:41,767
You can have it waiting on the table
for Tom when he gets home

742
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,934
- from a hard day of putting the cuffs on criminals.
- Mm.

743
01:04:43,958 --> 01:04:45,000
I'll drink to that.

744
01:04:46,458 --> 01:04:48,666
I don't think I'll ever manage
anything as fancy.

745
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:50,458
Rubbish. You're a good cook.

746
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,416
And with Patrick's help,

747
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:54,351
you'll become a gourmet, I'm sure of it.

748
01:04:54,375 --> 01:04:57,708
Yes, but between lesson plans
and staff meetings,

749
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,541
I'll barely be home before you get there.

750
01:04:59,625 --> 01:05:01,791
I don't like the sound of that.

751
01:05:01,875 --> 01:05:03,767
You plan to keep teaching, then?

752
01:05:03,791 --> 01:05:04,791
I hope to.

753
01:05:04,875 --> 01:05:06,250
Oh, good for you.

754
01:05:06,333 --> 01:05:08,226
If you enjoy your career,
why should you give it up?

755
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:10,416
I'll tell you why.

756
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:13,458
A mother ought to be at home
with her children.

757
01:05:13,541 --> 01:05:14,875
Tom, it's 1958.

758
01:05:14,958 --> 01:05:17,333
Educated women like Marion have careers.

759
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:21,541
I'm surprised you're being
so suburban about it.

760
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:23,625
What would you know about it?

761
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:27,226
- I...
- You know nothing about children or being a parent

762
01:05:27,250 --> 01:05:32,041
or being married, so stop telling me
what I'm supposed to think about it!

763
01:05:38,833 --> 01:05:40,625
Stop being such a...

764
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,791
Sorry.

765
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:07,208
Well, I've really gone
and blown it, haven't I?

766
01:06:07,291 --> 01:06:09,833
Oh, we, um, we ganged up on him.

767
01:06:09,916 --> 01:06:11,333
I was on your side.

768
01:06:11,416 --> 01:06:14,708
Tom and I are married now.

769
01:06:14,791 --> 01:06:17,416
We have to sort
these things out on our own.

770
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:59,083
Sorry.

771
01:07:59,166 --> 01:08:01,416
I had too much to drink.

772
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:02,875
I don't know what happened.

773
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,541
It's all right.

774
01:08:07,166 --> 01:08:10,166
- Listen, perhaps I should go.
- You're probably right.

775
01:08:56,208 --> 01:08:57,708
You have your things?

776
01:08:57,791 --> 01:08:59,583
In the car.

777
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:01,250
Thanks again for everything.

778
01:09:01,333 --> 01:09:03,125
You're welcome.

779
01:09:03,208 --> 01:09:04,583
Give my love to Marion.

780
01:09:04,666 --> 01:09:06,291
Will do.

781
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,541
Patrick's off.

782
01:09:32,625 --> 01:09:34,250
He said to say goodbye.

783
01:09:34,333 --> 01:09:37,583
Do you know what I think, Mrs. Burgess?

784
01:09:37,666 --> 01:09:40,208
I'm going to make you breakfast
for a change.

785
01:09:40,291 --> 01:09:42,000
Would you like that?

786
01:09:44,875 --> 01:09:46,250
Marion?

787
01:09:49,291 --> 01:09:50,791
What's wrong?

788
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:54,250
I know the place is a mess,
but I'll clean it up.

789
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:55,583
You won't have to do a thing.

790
01:09:58,875 --> 01:10:00,458
I want to go upstairs with you.

791
01:10:00,541 --> 01:10:02,375
All right.

792
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:57,583
It's beautiful.

793
01:10:57,666 --> 01:10:59,416
Don't you think?

794
01:11:04,208 --> 01:11:05,666
Patrick.

795
01:11:05,750 --> 01:11:08,125
You haven't been eating.

796
01:11:09,416 --> 01:11:11,083
I'm worried.

797
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:17,208
Is there something I can do for you?

798
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:22,666
Would you rather be in a home?

799
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:27,000
They're-they're awful,
but if you're unhappy here.

800
01:11:29,708 --> 01:11:32,416
Do you want to go back?

801
01:11:32,500 --> 01:11:34,833
Thank you.

802
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:36,458
All right.

803
01:12:06,458 --> 01:12:10,208
25th of May, 1958.

804
01:12:10,291 --> 01:12:14,416
Now they're married,
I can feel him slipping away.

805
01:12:23,791 --> 01:12:25,125
Tom.

806
01:12:27,125 --> 01:12:28,833
Don't ruin it.

807
01:12:30,125 --> 01:12:31,791
How would I do that?

808
01:12:33,333 --> 01:12:34,958
Asking about next time.

809
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:42,500
Do you know how long it's been
since we saw each other last?

810
01:12:42,583 --> 01:12:44,833
How many days?

811
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:46,583
I better go.

812
01:12:47,958 --> 01:12:51,166
Please, please, just...
just a few more minutes.

813
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:53,916
Marion expects me home after my shift.

814
01:12:55,750 --> 01:12:57,000
One more minute.

815
01:12:57,083 --> 01:12:58,708
She wants to have a baby.

816
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:07,875
You'll make a wonderful father.

817
01:13:11,458 --> 01:13:13,000
I have something for you.

818
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:24,208
A present.

819
01:13:28,083 --> 01:13:29,500
Guide to Venice.

820
01:13:29,583 --> 01:13:32,458
I'm going next month on museum business.

821
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:36,250
Why don't you come with me?

822
01:13:37,375 --> 01:13:38,958
To Venice?

823
01:13:39,041 --> 01:13:40,791
Just you and I.

824
01:13:42,541 --> 01:13:45,208
No checking the time and rushing off.

825
01:13:47,166 --> 01:13:48,791
No hiding.

826
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:51,916
No lies.

827
01:13:53,916 --> 01:13:55,851
- Wouldn't you enjoy that?
- Patrick, I'm married.

828
01:13:55,875 --> 01:13:58,625
Yeah, but even a married man has
the right to travel, doesn't he?

829
01:13:58,708 --> 01:14:01,416
I mean, some men go on fishing trips
with their friends.

830
01:14:01,500 --> 01:14:03,833
Yeah, a man ought to take his wife
on a holiday

831
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:05,250
before he goes off with a mate.

832
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:07,333
No, but this isn't a holiday.

833
01:14:07,416 --> 01:14:11,375
The museum is paying for an assistant,

834
01:14:11,458 --> 01:14:15,083
and I'm offering the position to you.

835
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:18,583
A real position?

836
01:14:18,666 --> 01:14:20,625
It pays 35 pounds.

837
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:23,250
- That's almost what I make in a month.
- Good.

838
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:26,375
Well, I'll book us a suite
in one of my favorite hotels.

839
01:14:28,083 --> 01:14:30,083
And what would I tell Marion?

840
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,833
- Patrick, I can't.
- Then I'll do it.

841
01:14:32,916 --> 01:14:33,916
I'll tell her.

842
01:14:39,958 --> 01:14:42,125
You mustn't hurt her, Patrick.

843
01:14:44,291 --> 01:14:47,000
She really is a wonderful person.

844
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:52,416
Follow me, please.

845
01:14:54,458 --> 01:14:56,041
Dance, go to the picture house,

846
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,416
or you can watch Punch and Judy
on the pier.

847
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,625
And that is art... music inspires us

848
01:15:00,708 --> 01:15:03,875
just like every single painting
in this gallery.

849
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:05,250
Right. Did you enjoy yourselves?

850
01:15:05,333 --> 01:15:06,416
Yes.

851
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,583
Yes? Good, good.

852
01:15:07,666 --> 01:15:10,458
Now, Miss Stewart here

853
01:15:10,541 --> 01:15:13,000
will give each of you
a lollipop, all right?

854
01:15:13,083 --> 01:15:15,458
Goodbye, now.

855
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:17,708
Oh, it's been such a delightful day.

856
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:19,309
The children have
thoroughly enjoyed themselves.

857
01:15:19,333 --> 01:15:20,653
I better get them back to school.

858
01:15:23,250 --> 01:15:26,750
Oh, I, uh... plan to put Tom
to work, you know.

859
01:15:26,833 --> 01:15:28,000
On what?

860
01:15:28,083 --> 01:15:29,643
Yes, the assistant curator couldn't go.

861
01:15:29,708 --> 01:15:31,541
I almost had to cancel
before Tom stepped in

862
01:15:31,625 --> 01:15:34,000
at the last minute and saved my neck.

863
01:15:34,083 --> 01:15:35,923
- I'm sorry, I-I don't...
- Our trip to Venice.

864
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:41,500
Tom's gonna be my assistant
while I pick up some new pieces.

865
01:15:41,583 --> 01:15:44,375
There'll be so much to pack up
and cart to the station.

866
01:15:44,458 --> 01:15:46,250
He'll do a splendid job.

867
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:49,416
And I've seen to it that he'll be
handsomely compensated.

868
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:53,583
Hasn't he mentioned it?

869
01:15:53,666 --> 01:15:55,083
Of course.

870
01:15:56,208 --> 01:15:58,583
Well, thanks for being a sport about it.

871
01:15:58,666 --> 01:16:00,000
Certainly.

872
01:16:01,166 --> 01:16:02,208
Come on, children!

873
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:04,083
Marion?

874
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:05,875
You're going to Venice.

875
01:17:05,958 --> 01:17:07,375
With Patrick.

876
01:17:09,833 --> 01:17:12,166
I hadn't decided.

877
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,958
Why shouldn't I go?

878
01:17:14,041 --> 01:17:15,916
Patrick is a sexual pervert.

879
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:19,041
That's ridiculous.

880
01:17:19,083 --> 01:17:21,458
It's obvious, Tom.

881
01:17:21,541 --> 01:17:23,291
To everyone but you.

882
01:17:23,375 --> 01:17:24,666
You're wrong!

883
01:17:24,750 --> 01:17:26,291
You want to see perverts?

884
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,916
Come down to the station,
and I will show you some.

885
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:31,541
They wear stuff on their faces,
rouge and that and jewelry.

886
01:17:31,625 --> 01:17:33,916
It's pathetic!

887
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,458
And they have this walk.

888
01:17:35,541 --> 01:17:38,458
- You can see them a mile off.
- All right, all right.

889
01:17:38,541 --> 01:17:40,000
I get the picture.

890
01:17:40,083 --> 01:17:42,000
He has business in Venice.

891
01:17:42,083 --> 01:17:43,583
I'm being paid.

892
01:17:43,666 --> 01:17:46,541
He's trying to destroy our marriage.

893
01:17:46,625 --> 01:17:47,750
You know what, Marion?

894
01:17:47,833 --> 01:17:49,517
I'm beginning to think
you've got a dirty mind.

895
01:17:49,541 --> 01:17:51,750
I don't know what to do.

896
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,750
- I have to do something.
- I'll tell you what we're going to do.

897
01:17:55,833 --> 01:17:58,250
We'll say no more about it.

898
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:01,791
I'm going in the other room.

899
01:18:01,875 --> 01:18:04,375
I want you to pull yourself together.

900
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:07,166
We'll have our tea and forget this.

901
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:09,041
Marion.

902
01:18:09,125 --> 01:18:11,125
Get a grip on yourself.

903
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,750
This love is all-consuming.

904
01:18:20,833 --> 01:18:24,666
I pity people who don't know
what it feels like to be this in love.

01:20:37,166 --> 01:20:38,750
Something's wrong.

924
01:20:38,833 --> 01:20:40,833
You ought to talk about it.

925
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:46,166
Tom's away.

926
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:47,625
Away?

927
01:20:48,791 --> 01:20:51,166
He's...

928
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:52,833
with Patrick.

929
01:20:53,958 --> 01:20:55,541
They're in Venice.

930
01:20:55,625 --> 01:20:57,625
Collecting pieces for the museum.

931
01:21:07,250 --> 01:21:09,250
Patrick is a homosexual.

932
01:21:10,375 --> 01:21:13,708
You have to be careful saying such things.

933
01:21:13,791 --> 01:21:16,291
He's in Venice with my husband.

934
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:17,833
And Tom?

935
01:21:19,125 --> 01:21:22,291
I think he, uh... has...

936
01:21:22,375 --> 01:21:26,458
tendencies that Patrick encourages.

937
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:33,250
What am I going to do?

938
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:35,083
Do?

939
01:21:35,166 --> 01:21:36,875
I have to help him.

940
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,333
I'm-I'm his wife.

941
01:21:38,416 --> 01:21:40,416
- Help him...?
- Change.

942
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:42,750
He has to.

943
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:44,583
Marion, listen to me.

944
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:49,291
I'm sorry to tell you this,
but it's the kindest thing I can do.

945
01:21:49,375 --> 01:21:51,375
He won't change.

946
01:21:52,375 --> 01:21:55,125
And it'll be better for both of you
if you accept that.

947
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:56,875
He has to give this up!

948
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:59,000
He can't.

949
01:21:59,083 --> 01:22:00,750
Stop saying that!

950
01:22:01,958 --> 01:22:04,125
He-he will change.

951
01:22:04,208 --> 01:22:05,458
W-With my help.

952
01:22:06,583 --> 01:22:08,208
It's just not true.

953
01:22:08,291 --> 01:22:09,875
When I...

954
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,083
think of them together,
it makes my stomach turn.

955
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:14,166
It's disgusting. It's wrong.

956
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:22,708
Well, if that's the case,
then I'm wrong, too.

957
01:22:24,166 --> 01:22:25,958
What have you got to do with it?

958
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,500
Good grief. Did you not know?

959
01:22:32,416 --> 01:22:35,083
If you could see the look on your face.

960
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:40,791
You're...?

961
01:22:40,875 --> 01:22:42,916
I have someone in my life.

962
01:22:44,416 --> 01:22:46,375
That I love.

963
01:22:46,458 --> 01:22:48,000
As much as you love Tom.

964
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:59,458
Five seconds ago, I was one person to you,

965
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:03,041
and now I'm something
altogether different.

966
01:23:04,541 --> 01:23:05,666
What's changed?

967
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,291
It's unnatural.

968
01:23:13,208 --> 01:23:16,916
And what about you
and your marriage is natural?

969
01:23:57,916 --> 01:23:59,708
Another breath for me.

970
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:12,750
Excuse me, Mr. Hazel wood.

971
01:24:12,833 --> 01:24:14,416
There's a gentleman here to see you.

972
01:24:14,500 --> 01:24:16,166
A policeman.

973
01:24:21,583 --> 01:24:23,958
Mr. Hazel wood, could we have a word?

974
01:24:51,083 --> 01:24:52,833
This way.

975
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:01,500
Rounded up another one.

976
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:12,541
Marion!

977
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:14,625
Marion!

978
01:25:14,708 --> 01:25:16,166
Tom?

979
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,083
- Tom?
- Patrick's been arrested!

980
01:25:18,166 --> 01:25:20,351
- I was at the station when they brought him in.
- What?

981
01:25:20,375 --> 01:25:22,517
They just looked right past me
like he didn't even know me.

982
01:25:22,541 --> 01:25:25,958
- Tom, slow down. Tell me...
- Someone reported him!

983
01:25:26,041 --> 01:25:27,500
Probably someone from the museum.

984
01:25:27,583 --> 01:25:29,708
- Oh, my God.
- And they dug up some wretch

985
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,059
who claimed Patrick had him
in the alleyway behind the Argyle.

986
01:25:32,083 --> 01:25:33,125
Listen to me.

987
01:25:33,208 --> 01:25:34,625
W-We can put all this behind us.

988
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,375
We can start our marriage again.

989
01:25:36,458 --> 01:25:38,375
Jesus, Marion!
This isn't about our marriage!

990
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:40,309
Patrick's going to prison,
and I'm bloody ruined!

991
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:42,208
Why you?

992
01:25:42,291 --> 01:25:44,916
If they know about Patrick,
they might know about...

993
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:50,458
So it's true?

994
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:52,250
You and Patrick.

995
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:53,708
Yes, it's true!

996
01:25:53,791 --> 01:25:56,458
Now someone will tell.

997
01:25:56,541 --> 01:25:59,666
They'll find out everything,
and that will be it.

998
01:25:59,750 --> 01:26:01,750
Then everyone will know what I...

999
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:04,500
I'm sorry.

1000
01:26:04,583 --> 01:26:07,000
I know I've let you down. I lied.

1001
01:26:08,541 --> 01:26:10,166
What am I going to do?

1002
01:26:11,416 --> 01:26:13,250
No one will ever know.

1003
01:26:13,333 --> 01:26:14,333
How can they not?

1004
01:26:14,416 --> 01:26:16,583
Because Patrick would never tell them.

1005
01:26:16,666 --> 01:26:19,083
You don't know how the police work.

1006
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:22,416
Patrick wouldn't do that to you.

1007
01:26:25,583 --> 01:26:27,333
It's all right.

1008
01:26:27,416 --> 01:26:31,125
We'll find a lawyer for Patrick.

1009
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,625
A good one.

1010
01:26:32,708 --> 01:26:35,750
And if I have to, I'll stand up
as a character witness.

1011
01:26:41,750 --> 01:26:43,541
I'm so sorry.

1012
01:26:47,916 --> 01:26:49,333
I'm sorry.

1013
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,541
I'm so sorry.

1014
01:26:53,583 --> 01:26:57,625
Mr. Hazel wood gave my class
a tour of the museum.

1015
01:26:57,708 --> 01:26:59,458
And during that visit,

1016
01:26:59,541 --> 01:27:02,875
did you have any reason
to believe that Mr. Hazel wood

1017
01:27:02,958 --> 01:27:04,458
was a danger to your pupils

1018
01:27:04,541 --> 01:27:08,791
or in any way
a negative influence on them?

1019
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:11,083
On the contrary, the children loved him.

1020
01:27:13,625 --> 01:27:16,250
Do you believe that
Mr. Hazel wood is capable

1021
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:18,750
of performing the acts
with which he stands accused?

1022
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,875
Namely, gross indecency
in a public convenience

1023
01:27:21,958 --> 01:27:23,791
and endangering public morals.

1024
01:27:23,875 --> 01:27:25,291
No.

1025
01:27:25,375 --> 01:27:27,125
I do not.

1026
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:28,583
Thank you.

1027
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,791
Mrs. Burgess,

1028
01:27:35,875 --> 01:27:38,750
do you know Mr. Hazel wood
in another capacity?

1029
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:39,916
Other than professional.

1030
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,583
Yes.

1031
01:27:43,166 --> 01:27:44,500
He is a friend.

1032
01:27:45,708 --> 01:27:48,875
A close friend
of your husband's, is he not?

1033
01:27:48,958 --> 01:27:51,750
My husband and I
both consider him a friend.

1034
01:27:51,833 --> 01:27:53,708
But he and your husband
are particularly close.

1035
01:27:53,791 --> 01:27:55,458
Isn't that true?

1036
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:58,375
So close they recently traveled
to Italy together.

1037
01:27:58,458 --> 01:28:00,250
Patrick had business there.

1038
01:28:00,333 --> 01:28:02,416
Did your husband have business there?

1039
01:28:02,500 --> 01:28:03,708
He was assisting him.

1040
01:28:03,791 --> 01:28:05,500
Assisting?

1041
01:28:05,583 --> 01:28:07,416
Yes.

1042
01:28:08,833 --> 01:28:11,333
Mrs. Burgess, I'd like to read an extract

1043
01:28:11,416 --> 01:28:13,833
from one of Patrick Hazelwood's diaries.

1044
01:28:13,916 --> 01:28:16,458
These were collected in his apartment
when he was arrested.

1045
01:28:16,541 --> 01:28:19,875
Some of it is rather purple, I'm afraid.

1046
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:24,291
This is from a page dated
31st of July, 1957.

1047
01:28:24,375 --> 01:28:28,416
"I recognized him even from behind.

1048
01:28:28,500 --> 01:28:30,166
"That fine head.

1049
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,833
"The unmistakable line of his shoulder.

1050
01:28:32,916 --> 01:28:37,416
My policeman was magnificently alive
in front of me."

1051
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:42,541
Mrs. Burgess, who is "my policeman"?

1052
01:28:43,875 --> 01:28:45,333
I have no idea.

1053
01:28:45,416 --> 01:28:48,041
Perhaps another extract
will help you remember.

1054
01:28:48,125 --> 01:28:51,041
This is from a later date.

1055
01:28:52,458 --> 01:28:56,000
"We've been meeting in the afternoons,
if he can get away,

1056
01:28:56,083 --> 01:28:57,666
"or in the evenings,

1057
01:28:57,750 --> 01:29:00,625
"but he hasn't forgotten
the schoolteacher.

1058
01:29:00,708 --> 01:29:03,416
"Yesterday, he brought her to the museum.

1059
01:29:03,500 --> 01:29:05,500
"She's instinctively possessive.

1060
01:29:05,583 --> 01:29:08,333
"She touched his shoulders
at every opportunity.

1061
01:29:08,416 --> 01:29:10,583
"If only she knew that my hands had been

1062
01:29:10,666 --> 01:29:12,833
"on those same shoulders the night before,

1063
01:29:12,916 --> 01:29:15,125
as my policeman and I..."

1064
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:21,333
I'll stop here, as the next passage
borders on obscenity.

1065
01:29:21,416 --> 01:29:25,333
Mrs. Burgess,
you're a schoolteacher, aren't you?

1066
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:27,791
Yes.

1067
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:30,208
And what is your husband's occupation?

1068
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:35,833
Mrs. Burgess?

1069
01:29:35,916 --> 01:29:37,291
A policeman.

1070
01:29:37,375 --> 01:29:38,791
Speak up, please.

1071
01:29:41,833 --> 01:29:43,583
A policeman.

1072
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:09,125
- I'll see you in the car.
- All right.

1073
01:30:13,875 --> 01:30:15,708
- Oh, Mrs. Burgess.
- Oh!

1074
01:30:15,791 --> 01:30:16,916
Hey.

1075
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:03,750
Did you see Nigel and his friend?

1076
01:31:03,833 --> 01:31:05,500
They live a few streets over.

1077
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,916
What's wrong?

1078
01:31:10,000 --> 01:31:11,750
Nothing.

1079
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:13,416
I'm fine.

1080
01:31:25,541 --> 01:31:27,666
I see a psychiatrist...

1081
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:33,291
...who has generously offered
to help me change.

1082
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:38,000
Isn't that kind of him?

1083
01:31:41,083 --> 01:31:42,375
What happened to your face?

1084
01:31:42,458 --> 01:31:45,125
This is a prison, Marion.

1085
01:31:46,750 --> 01:31:48,458
My new home.

1086
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:51,291
For two years, in fact.

1087
01:31:57,291 --> 01:31:58,666
How's the food?

1088
01:31:58,750 --> 01:32:00,642
Oh, for God's sake,
I don't want to talk about the food.

1089
01:32:00,666 --> 01:32:02,416
Tell me about Tom.

1090
01:32:03,833 --> 01:32:06,000
- How is he?
- Um...

1091
01:32:07,125 --> 01:32:09,791
He found a job.

1092
01:32:09,875 --> 01:32:12,000
I've kept my teaching position.

1093
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:14,875
So, we'll manage.

1094
01:32:14,958 --> 01:32:16,438
Could you ask him to come and see me?

1095
01:32:16,500 --> 01:32:18,583
- I need to see him.
- I-I can't.

1096
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:21,041
Please, Marion, please. I have to see him.

1097
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:22,791
No touching.

1098
01:32:28,791 --> 01:32:30,333
I'll ask him.

1099
01:32:31,666 --> 01:32:33,791
But surely you realize he can't come.

1100
01:32:37,208 --> 01:32:38,708
I'm sorry.

1101
01:32:47,708 --> 01:32:49,666
Well, you must be pleased about all this.

1102
01:32:51,250 --> 01:32:52,958
Why on earth would I be pleased?

1103
01:32:54,416 --> 01:32:56,166
You've won.

1104
01:33:00,208 --> 01:33:01,666
Patrick...

1105
01:33:02,875 --> 01:33:04,541
...nobody's won.

1106
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:02,625
I wish you hadn't done that.

1107
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:05,500
It's not much good to me now, is it?

1108
01:34:05,583 --> 01:34:07,000
I've seen Patrick.

1109
01:34:10,958 --> 01:34:12,416
He asked after you.

1110
01:34:13,833 --> 01:34:15,458
Why did you have to go?

1111
01:34:15,541 --> 01:34:17,583
Everyone else has deserted him.

1112
01:34:22,791 --> 01:34:26,125
Tom, there's something I... have to know.

1113
01:34:28,875 --> 01:34:33,000
Do you... love Patrick?

1114
01:34:33,083 --> 01:34:35,500
- For God's sake, Marion...
- No, it's important.

1115
01:34:35,583 --> 01:34:37,666
Do you love him?

1116
01:34:52,208 --> 01:34:53,666
I love you.

1117
01:35:15,708 --> 01:35:17,583
I can't lose you.

1118
01:35:18,708 --> 01:35:20,916
Let's not mention his name again.

1119
01:38:14,375 --> 01:38:15,500
What's this?

1120
01:38:15,583 --> 01:38:17,958
I need to talk to you.

1121
01:38:18,041 --> 01:38:21,041
- You're going out?
- Tom, please.

1122
01:38:21,125 --> 01:38:23,666
I've tried to help Patrick,

1123
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:26,958
but he fights me at every turn,
and you're angry all the time.

1124
01:38:27,041 --> 01:38:28,958
Oh, what the devil
are you trying to do now?

1125
01:38:29,041 --> 01:38:31,041
Let me speak.

1126
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:34,333
I think I brought Patrick here
because I've been so lonely.

1127
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:35,416
What do you mean?

1128
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:37,291
I'm always here.

1129
01:38:37,375 --> 01:38:38,416
You're never here.

1130
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,000
I've never had you, not for myself.

1131
01:38:40,083 --> 01:38:43,166
He was always in your life, in our lives.

1132
01:38:43,250 --> 01:38:46,583
Just stop this foolishness.

1133
01:38:46,666 --> 01:38:48,166
Sit down. I'll make us some tea.

1134
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:49,625
You say we never talk?

1135
01:38:49,708 --> 01:38:51,958
- All right, we'll talk.
- I'm leaving.

1136
01:38:53,375 --> 01:38:54,458
What?

1137
01:38:54,541 --> 01:38:56,791
I can't stay here. It will kill me.

1138
01:38:56,875 --> 01:38:59,083
For God's sake,
you brought him back into our lives.

1139
01:38:59,166 --> 01:39:02,059
You s-stirred everything up, and now,
and now you think you're going to leave.

1140
01:39:02,083 --> 01:39:03,083
And what do I do?

1141
01:39:03,166 --> 01:39:06,250
Oh, for once, Tom,
you might take care of yourself.

1142
01:39:06,333 --> 01:39:08,833
Oh, so now we're back to this,
how I-I ruined your life.

1143
01:39:08,916 --> 01:39:10,708
No, you didn't.

1144
01:39:10,791 --> 01:39:13,500
But you did lie to me.

1145
01:39:13,583 --> 01:39:15,708
From the day we met. And you kept lying.

1146
01:39:15,791 --> 01:39:17,750
You loved Patrick, and...

1147
01:39:17,833 --> 01:39:19,583
- Stop.
- ...you still love him.

1148
01:39:19,666 --> 01:39:21,708
- Just stop.
- All of these years,

1149
01:39:21,791 --> 01:39:24,541
I've blamed myself
for keeping the two of you apart,

1150
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:27,583
and I never really thought,
"What have I missed?"

1151
01:39:27,666 --> 01:39:30,166
No, I'm not, I'm not,
I'm not listening to this.

1152
01:39:30,250 --> 01:39:32,875
I reported Patrick to the museum.

1153
01:39:36,208 --> 01:39:37,916
It was me.

1154
01:39:46,916 --> 01:39:50,833
When the two of you were in Venice,
I felt so betrayed.

1155
01:39:50,916 --> 01:39:54,708
And then your postcard came.

1156
01:39:54,791 --> 01:39:58,708
It felt like you were taunting me.

1157
01:39:58,791 --> 01:40:01,583
I-I just felt so humiliated.

1158
01:40:02,875 --> 01:40:05,791
Then it occurred to me
there was something I could do

1159
01:40:05,875 --> 01:40:08,083
to win you back and save our marriage.

1160
01:40:10,166 --> 01:40:14,291
I wrote an anonymous letter
to Patrick's supervisor.

1161
01:40:17,166 --> 01:40:20,125
I said I had personal knowledge
that Patrick was a homosexual

1162
01:40:20,208 --> 01:40:23,541
and I imagined he wouldn't want
the museum's patrons

1163
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:28,000
exposed to that kind of person,
especially children.

1164
01:40:39,541 --> 01:40:41,666
The next day, I regretted it,

1165
01:40:41,750 --> 01:40:45,000
and I've had to live with it ever since.

1166
01:40:52,375 --> 01:40:54,333
I-I tried to make up for what I'd done

1167
01:40:54,416 --> 01:40:57,083
by standing up for him
at the trial, but...

1168
01:41:01,291 --> 01:41:03,916
You know what happened.

1169
01:41:04,000 --> 01:41:07,208
So I decided

1170
01:41:07,291 --> 01:41:09,666
the only thing left for me to do

1171
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:12,500
was to get you through the mess we'd made,

1172
01:41:12,583 --> 01:41:14,583
and I thought, "Now I'll have him."

1173
01:41:16,208 --> 01:41:17,875
"I'll have him for myself."

1174
01:41:17,958 --> 01:41:19,708
But I never did.

1175
01:41:22,375 --> 01:41:24,208
You destroyed him.

1176
01:41:25,333 --> 01:41:27,208
We destroyed each other.

1177
01:41:31,333 --> 01:41:33,333
I shouldn't have deceived you.

1178
01:41:35,250 --> 01:41:36,875
It wasn't right.

1179
01:41:36,958 --> 01:41:39,583
But I-I couldn't tell you.

1180
01:41:40,541 --> 01:41:42,916
You would've left me, and...

1181
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:44,666
I did want you.

1182
01:41:47,500 --> 01:41:49,500
But I wanted him, too.

1183
01:41:54,875 --> 01:41:58,541
Nigel's number is there on the counter.

1184
01:41:58,625 --> 01:42:00,791
- And the chemist.
- You can't be serious.

1185
01:42:00,875 --> 01:42:02,958
We don't make each other happy.

1186
01:42:03,041 --> 01:42:05,500
- Of course we do.
- No, Tom.

1187
01:42:05,583 --> 01:42:09,083
You-you have the sea, your swimming.

1188
01:42:09,166 --> 01:42:12,000
I don't even like Peacehaven.

1189
01:42:12,083 --> 01:42:15,458
When I pictured my retirement, I saw...

1190
01:42:16,625 --> 01:42:19,708
...museums, the theater, weekends in...

1191
01:42:19,791 --> 01:42:21,166
I don't know, something.

1192
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:22,375
What do you want from me?

1193
01:42:22,458 --> 01:42:24,041
Uh, do you want me to beg you to stay?

1194
01:42:24,125 --> 01:42:26,125
All right. I am begging you.

1195
01:42:26,208 --> 01:42:28,625
Tom, Patrick's failing.

1196
01:42:29,916 --> 01:42:34,416
I think he can turn around,
but I have to wash my hands of it.

1197
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:38,375
You can send him to a home,
but I hope you won't.

1198
01:42:38,458 --> 01:42:40,708
I hope you'll keep him here and love him.

1199
01:42:40,791 --> 01:42:42,125
It's what he needs.

1200
01:42:42,208 --> 01:42:43,642
It's what you need. And I need to go.

1201
01:42:43,666 --> 01:42:45,559
- I'll be at my sister's for a while...
- Please, please.

1202
01:42:45,583 --> 01:42:46,934
- ...and then I'll have to...
- Please don't go.

1203
01:42:46,958 --> 01:42:48,416
Please don't go.

1204
01:42:48,500 --> 01:42:50,250
I can't...

1205
01:42:50,333 --> 01:42:52,041
I can't live alone.

1206
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,708
Tom, you're not alone.
