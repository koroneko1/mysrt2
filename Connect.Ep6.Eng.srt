1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,003
(theme music)

2
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,382
DOLCHI

3
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,891
Yeah, did you find her?

4
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,434
MAN (on cell phone): Yes.

5
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,526
(suspenseful music)

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,696
MR. KIM: Stay close to her and learn everything you can.

7
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,367
Where they're based,

8
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:21,206
if they live as a group or mooch off of someone,

9
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,208
how many there are.

10
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,473
(grunts)

11
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,727
(groans)

12
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:48,775
BOSS 2

13
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,906
Ugh, so annoying...

14
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:03,540
I heard you found her.

15
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:07,377
Separated from the eyeball and currently alone.

16
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,674
She hasn't left Seohan City yet.

17
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:16,469
Ugh, they were right under our noses

18
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:20,014
and we let them go like idiots, oh, man...

19
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:24,811
We'll keep this between us...

20
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,982
I won't report to the higher-ups.

21
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:32,610
Oh, of course, we worked so hard for that information.

22
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,577
Yeah, with the eye patch, it's gotta be Ha Dongsoo.

23
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,454
That little…

24
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,707
(sighs)

25
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,918
I mean, he could jump from the rooftop, this is nothing for him! Damn it.

26
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,295
(scoffs)

27
00:02:51,171 --> 00:02:52,797
He's certainly different.

28
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:53,798
Right?

29
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,091
(Detective Choi inhales deeply)

30
00:02:56,217 --> 00:03:01,514
Why did Oh Jinseop pretend to be Ha Dongsoo?

31
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,392
Sir?

32
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:06,895
To pin the murder charge on him?

33
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,608
Or is it something else?

34
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:17,822
You mean, this... this... this is O... Oh Jinseop?

35
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,325
I know how this ends.

36
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,789
Go arrest Oh Jinseop, right now.

37
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:32,629
(Gideun snores)

38
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:40,053
Wake up! Gideun!

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,473
(groans)

40
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:50,271
(snarls lightly)

41
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,778
-Pack your things, too. -(Gideun grunts)

42
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,613
Starting tomorrow,

43
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:04,953
we'll have a better place to eat and sleep in than this hole.

44
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,579
(growls lightly)

45
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,999
From now on, we'll crush anyone...

46
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,379
who tries to take advantage of our power.

47
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:16,297
(Gideun growls)

48
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,431
(growls)

49
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,517
(foreboding music)

50
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:54,585
(scoffs) What are you looking at?

51
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:08,891
JINSEOP: You see what beauty could come from using the human body as a medium?

52
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,812
You should recognize that surgeon from before.

53
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,481
Organ trafficking gang...

54
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,860
(breathes shakily)

55
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,403
Where is Z?

56
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:23,865
What would you do if you knew? Would you help him?

57
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,576
Stop getting innocent people involved.

58
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,627
We're polar opposites.

59
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,590
I wanted to ascend into a plane of eternal beauty

60
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:44,552
despite being born into a life of insignificance.

61
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:48,097
You were born outside a world that doesn't want you,

62
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,767
but you still so desperately wanted to become a part of it.

63
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:55,313
I create art,

64
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,108
and you sing,

65
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,072
and the two of us met through eye transplant.

66
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,161
Doesn't this conjunction of fate feel beautiful?

67
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:16,542
Oh, wait, maybe for you it's repulsive?

68
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,253
Isn't it obvious?

69
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,797
JINSEOP: Well, be that as it may.

70
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:25,009
In the eyes of the world, you and I are both treated like monsters.

71
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,970
(breathes deeply)

72
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,892
(tongue clicks)

73
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,228
The same but complete opposites.

74
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,274
That relationship itself creates newness.

75
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:46,864
Whether that is beauty or something more fundamental.

76
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,703
Light and shadow, negative and positive, man and woman.

77
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,373
If things far apart can be linked

78
00:06:58,167 --> 00:06:59,877
as one...

79
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:07,135
How about it? Would you like to live with me as one?

80
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:09,846
What?

81
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:19,897
We become one, by attaching my head to your body.

82
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:24,652
You sick bastard.

83
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,156
Where's Z?

84
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,157
(breathes shakily)

85
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,078
DONGSOO: I... I came as promised,

86
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,415
bring me Z.

87
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:44,338
You leave me no choice. I must start the experiment.

88
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:47,967
Experiment?

89
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,812
(whimpers)

90
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,190
(breathes heavily)

91
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,692
Mr. Z, I'm sorry,

92
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,822
because of me you're... (sighs deeply)

93
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,949
(Dongsoo sniffles)

94
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,409
Who...

95
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,246
Oh, I am, uh...

96
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,376
I'm Guitar Man.

97
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,086
Lonely Guitar Man.

98
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,338
DONGSOO: Shut up.

99
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,464
(laughs)

100
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:30,801
Guitar Man?

101
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:35,223
Oh, I'm really sorry,

102
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,684
you were kidnapped to lure me here.

103
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:44,774
What do you mean?

104
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,235
So…

105
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,321
How do I start?

106
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,281
(breathes shakily)

107
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,453
That bastard is the corpse art killer.

108
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,040
The corpse art murder case?

109
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:07,296
Yes. I've been keeping track of his crimes so far, and, uh...

110
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,840
A detective?

111
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:13,135
Oh, no, I, I'm actually not...

112
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,430
Oh, Guitar Man.

113
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:22,895
Yes. Uh, you covered my song.

114
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:27,275
It was an honor, really, and, uh...

115
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:29,235
You seriously suck at explaining.

116
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,695
(breathing shakily)

117
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,907
Wh... what are you doing?

118
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,036
(groaning)

119
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,330
(Dongsoo groans)

120
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,374
(sucks teeth)

121
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,044
This is it, right here. The reason Guitar Man is lonely.

122
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,173
(soft grunt)

123
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:56,721
You're probably thinking, "What in the world is this?" Yes?

124
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,931
(panting) Oh, no.

125
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,268
Don't do it, stop!

126
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:05,605
(groans)

127
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,940
You damn psychopath!

128
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,067
-(sobs) -(laughs)

129
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,659
It wouldn't connect back, normally.

130
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:22,121
See? That's to be expected.

131
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:25,166
But his finger...

132
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,966
(Z gasping)

133
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,812
(breathes shakily)

134
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,272
Interesting, isn't it?

135
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,359
But this is not the purpose of this experiment.

136
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,195
The important part is just about to begin.

137
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:59,241
Take a good look at what happens to your finger.

138
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,663
(breathes heavily)

139
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,044
(Dongsoo grunting)

140
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,174
(gasping)

141
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,599
How did something like this come into this world?

142
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,394
(Dongsoo breathes heavily) How should I know?

143
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,862
JINSEOP: Don't you dare call him a monster.

144
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:40,658
All of this is a miracle.

145
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:46,247
That life was created in this universe, that a Connect has finally appeared,

146
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,208
and that I've met him.

147
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:51,377
(breathing heavily)

148
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:53,838
You don't need Z anymore. Right?

149
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,591
I'm here now.

150
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,219
That is true.

151
00:12:03,139 --> 00:12:06,350
Spare Z's life, please.

152
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,812
Okay, I'll let him go.

153
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:23,284
If you accept my proposal to become one with me.

154
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,538
"Become one"?

155
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,835
N... no, that's not it, you m... misunderstand.

156
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,087
What this bastard means is that he'd cut my head off

157
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,592
and switch bodies, or something like that...

158
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,845
Doesn't that sound weirder? Think about it.

159
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,555
(breathes heavily)

160
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:49,185
You're really the corpse art murderer...

161
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,317
(panting)

162
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:00,738
If Guitar Man doesn't accept my proposal,

163
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,911
then I'll be putting you up somewhere as my next piece.

164
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:09,246
(breathing shakily)

165
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,291
You crazy bastard.

166
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,877
(clanking)

167
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,006
(laughs)

168
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,009
MINSOOK: Wow, what a cool Santa Claus we got here.

169
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,180
Who's there?

170
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,434
Who is it?

171
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,355
(knocks on door)

172
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,779
Oh, look who's here.

173
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:47,409
Our missing wallet turned itself back in, then?

174
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:51,747
I got tired of running around. And I brought a friend, too.

175
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,504
(Gideun growling)

176
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,424
What is that?

177
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,636
A monster?

178
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,971
(Gideun snarling)

179
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,389
(gasps)

180
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:11,308
You shouldn't say something like that all of a sudden.

181
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,812
IRANG: It's taboo.

182
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,065
Say it again.

183
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,900
What?

184
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,236
Monster?

185
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,155
(snarling)

186
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,995
(roars)

187
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,038
(grunts)

188
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,541
(Eunpyo exclaims)

189
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:36,625
(growls)

190
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,587
(all grunting)

191
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,475
(pants)

192
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,436
(grunts)

193
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:58,814
(roars)

194
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,276
(grunts)

195
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,661
(groans)

196
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:14,747
(grunts)

197
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,125
(gasps)

198
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,670
(grunts)

199
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:26,175
(growls)

200
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:29,887
(snarls)

201
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,267
(grunting)

202
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,144
(groans)

203
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,867
(shouts)

204
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,243
(growls)

205
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:10,719
Yeah, okay, yeah, hang on, sir, remember how we couldn't recover

206
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,973
some photos in that digital camera found at the irrigation channel?

207
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,016
-Yeah. -They were all completely recovered.

208
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,309
(sniffles)

209
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,852
Send them right now.

210
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,402
Aw, Sungjun, ah...

211
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,195
Oh, oh, damn, wait a second.

212
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:32,282
-Man, you make my life so difficult. -Are you all right? Wait...

213
00:16:32,366 --> 00:16:33,575
(exhales)

214
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,830
We can find the GPS data for this photo here, too, right?

215
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,123
Of course.

216
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,793
DETECTIVE CHOI: Let's go over here, right now.

217
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,964
Yes, sir. Yeah, right, Detective Choi and I are heading down

218
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,134
to that building in photo number 28 now.

219
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,927
So you inform the superiors

220
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,680
and bring every SWAT team member available.

221
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,279
(whimpers)

222
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,115
(Dongsoo shouting) Let Z go right now!

223
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,200
(breathing heavily)

224
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,915
By saying that, do you mean to accept my proposal?

225
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:25,085
(breathing shakily)

226
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,297
(groans)

227
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,010
(breathes heavily)

228
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,269
(Dongsoo gasping)

229
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:55,449
Oh...

230
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,534
(breathes shakily)

231
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,790
Mr. Z.

232
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,459
Mr. Z.

233
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,796
Can you hear me?

234
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:11,924
Mr. Z...

235
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,181
Sorry.

236
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,142
(breathes shakily)

237
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:29,942
You were uncovering...

238
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,318
(gasps softly)

239
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,531
...that damned murder case,

240
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,453
and I got in the way, didn't I?

241
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,122
(breathes shakily)

242
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,375
(stutters) No.

243
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,003
It's all my fault,

244
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,049
I dragged you into this.

245
00:18:58,011 --> 00:19:00,222
(breathes heavily)

246
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,644
Feels like I got in the way...

247
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:07,896
(coughs)

248
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,483
(breathes shakily)

249
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:19,741
Sorry...

250
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,081
I couldn't be...

251
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,586
of any help....

252
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,633
(Dongsoo gasps)

253
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,011
(gasps)

254
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,013
DONGSOO: Mr. Z.

255
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,766
Mr. Z.

256
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,059
(scoffs)

257
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,230
Oh, Mr. Z!

258
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,524
(sobbing)

259
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:15,339
Y... your arrangement for that song...

260
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,176
was truly the best.

261
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:30,520
I... I really wanted to say th...

262
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:36,193
thank you, I'm sorry.

263
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,623
(breathing shakily)

264
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,999
(chain rattling)

265
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,972
(grunts)

266
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,266
(inhales sharply)

267
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,188
(shouting)

268
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,234
(pants)

269
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,611
(groans)

270
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,288
(grunts)

271
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:31,790
(breathes heavily)

272
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,390
He got out of his binding?

273
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,685
(scoffs) That never gets old.

274
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,145
(grunting)

275
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,230
(panting)

276
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,784
(Gideun growls)

277
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,787
Tired from all that fighting, aren't you?

278
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,831
(rumbles)

279
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,124
Take a break.

280
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,917
(rumbles)

281
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,136
(faint thud)

282
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,814
(ominous music)

283
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,238
(grunts) Ah, please, please, oh, come on.

284
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,449
(grunts)

285
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,284
(exhales sharply)

286
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,796
-IRANG: Dongsoo? -(gasps)

287
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,175
Irang?

288
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:09,012
Irang! (gasps)

289
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,182
(grunts)

290
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,310
(yelps)

291
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,271
Who are you?

292
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:21,066
(grunting)

293
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,821
A Connect...

294
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,073
(grunting)

295
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,574
JINSEOP: There's a woman, too?

296
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,413
(breathes shakily)

297
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,248
What's happening?

298
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:44,256
You burnt an awful lot of cash.

299
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,885
I did think the corpse art was uncanny all the way around,

300
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,973
but you really put your whole back into it behind the scenes, huh?

301
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,271
Can your bodies' abilities be passed down to the next generation?

302
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,900
That's what I wanted to know. But you're curious too?

303
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:11,408
I wonder what a rich murderer is into.

304
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:16,371
You want to take Dongsoo's body and make a baby with me?

305
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:19,291
Or would you like to take my body and make a baby with Dongsoo?

306
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,128
Surprise, surprise. Maybe you're into the latter, huh?

307
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:29,718
And which do you prefer? Either way, we will bear a Connect's offspring.

308
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:33,680
Personally, I want nothing more than for you to die here right now.

309
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:39,102
Hm, that will go according to fate. And your name is?

310
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,604
Irang!

311
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,441
Hey! He was talking to me!

312
00:24:44,524 --> 00:24:46,902
(grunting)

313
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,156
(both grunt)

314
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:01,708
(groans)

315
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,928
(grunting)

316
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,729
(scoffs) Ha, you bastard...

317
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,399
(grunting)

318
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,532
(yelps)

319
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,116
(groaning)

320
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:37,619
(grunts)

321
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,503
(breathes heavily)

322
00:26:06,565 --> 00:26:07,691
Ah...

323
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,652
(sighs)

324
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,240
(exhales deeply)

325
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:26,751
(whispers) Sir, looks like we could enter

326
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,378
through up there.

327
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,256
-Go that way. -Yes, sir.

328
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,683
(pants)

329
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,645
I... Irang, what happened to you? Are you okay?

330
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:49,149
You're one to talk.

331
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,359
Where is he?

332
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,862
Someone's here, but I don't know who.

333
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,281
He went that way.

334
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,160
You go finish him.

335
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,455
I'll leave how it ends up to you.

336
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,625
What do you mean?

337
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:12,422
Fate or chance, it doesn't end here.

338
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:25,060
The future must be changed.

339
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,953
(Gideun growls)

340
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,628
-(roars) -(gunshot)

341
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,425
(panting)

342
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,719
(grunts)

343
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,103
(gun clanks)

344
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,437
(gags)

345
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,748
What the... This one's a Connect too?

346
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:32,001
(grunts)

347
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,505
(breathes heavily)

348
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,678
(soft growling)

349
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:48,601
We'll have to get rid of you. You know too much.

350
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,408
DETECTIVE CHOI: I remember you.

351
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:06,161
From the security camera at Oh Jinseop's building.

352
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:11,374
So you're a Connect, too?

353
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,335
There you go again with that nonsense.

354
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,839
It would have been better for you to play the fool.

355
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,302
Is Oh Jinseop here?

356
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:24,721
And Ha Dongsoo too?

357
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,937
What difference would it make if you know? You're going to die here and now anyway.

358
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,439
(chuckles softly)

359
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:42,447
Even if I die, I want to uncover the truth...

360
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,532
That's what detectives do.

361
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,452
Oh, how noble of you.

362
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,705
And how unfortunate.

363
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:55,210
If you didn't know anything, I would have helped you with the investigation.

364
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:03,134
We will survive, whatever it takes.

365
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:05,011
(Gideun growls)

366
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,639
Killing a few detectives to reach that end?

367
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:11,017
That's nothing.

368
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,562
(low growl)

369
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:15,855
(scoffs)

370
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,152
(inhales deeply)

371
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:30,036
I thought I'd seen my fair share of bad things in life,

372
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:39,254
but I guess I have a long ways to go until I've seen it all.

373
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:46,344
I can't imagine what tough lives you and Ha Dongsoo must have had.

374
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,056
(mellow music)

375
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,988
JINSEOP: How much are you able to recover from?

376
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,865
(rattles)

377
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:09,909
For example...

378
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:19,919
What would happen if I shot you in the head?

379
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,882
(laughs)

380
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,927
Would that stop your body from moving temporarily?

381
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:34,851
If that works, the next time you open your eyes,

382
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:40,773
your body will have been swallowed...

383
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,239
by late-stage cancer.

384
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,705
(coughs)

385
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,420
What have you been trying to do all this time

386
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,339
with that immortal body of yours?

387
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:12,388
Don't tell me some pathetic dream to live

388
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:16,768
a normal life was all it was.

389
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:34,869
DONGSOO: I'm not like you.

390
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,207
If I could, I'd live an ordinary life.

391
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:44,629
I will never give my body over to you.

(breathes heavily)

436

Stop it!

(pants)

438
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:18,152
Don't. I am begging you to stop.

No matter how despicable and horrid

442
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:31,499
this murderer is, if you kill him,

443
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,501
I have no choice but to prosecute you,

444
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:37,213
because you will also be a murderer yourself.

445
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,842
(mutters)

446
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,638
This lowlife...

447
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,183
took precious lives.

448
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,936
(Dongsoo breathes shakily)

449
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:54,981
Is that right?

450
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,235
Yes, well, it's over.

451
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:05,700
Leave this all to me, and you'd better get out of here.

452
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,077
You've got someone waiting for you.

453
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:14,458
Irang.

454
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,935
Pretty soon SWAT guys will barge in here.

455
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:36,814
They won't bat an eye at your story.

456
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,070

(gunfiring in distance)

459
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:07,636
Dongsoo, we have to go. They're coming.

460
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:08,804
They?

461
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,058
(creaking)

462
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,518
Hurry!

463
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,107
(foreboding music)

464
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,505
(growls)

465
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,558

(closing theme music)
