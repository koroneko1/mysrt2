Viewer discretion is advised

00:00:19.293 --> 00:00:20.772
How is the situation?

00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:23.879
The group supporting The World Remembers is gaining momentum.

00:00:25.778 --> 00:00:26.742
Hey!

00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:28.103
Stop it.

00:00:28.103 --> 00:00:31.839
Isn’t this an obvious abuse of power, student prefect?

00:00:32.084 --> 00:00:32.826
You jerk.

00:00:33.086 --> 00:00:34.431
You took my notebook, didn’t you?

00:00:35.043 --> 00:00:36.207
What the hell?

00:00:36.207 --> 00:00:37.151
I didn’t.

00:00:37.151 --> 00:00:38.410
If it’s not you, then who?

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.847
Would be nice if it’s a “who.”

00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:42.182
I’m afraid it might be the curse of Suppalo.

00:00:50.011 --> 00:00:55.808
I pledge to uphold Suppalo rules and regulations.

00:00:57.637 --> 00:01:00.852
With rules comes honor.

00:01:01.316 --> 00:01:04.423
With rules comes honor.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.063
The first rule of being good student prefects is

00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:11.422
be selfless.

00:01:12.703 --> 00:01:15.354
You aren’t just you anymore.

00:01:15.954 --> 00:01:17.585
You’re the representative of us all.

00:01:26.918 --> 00:01:28.332
New student prefect,

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:29.457
are you ready?

00:01:30.108 --> 00:01:31.093
I am.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.889
With rules comes honor.

00:01:58.213 --> 00:02:01.341
With rules comes honor.

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:05.000
With rules comes honor.

00:02:12.402 --> 00:02:15.639
With rules comes honor.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:38.376
Akk!

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:44.348
Don’t butt in.

00:02:44.348 --> 00:02:45.137
Akk.

00:02:45.801 --> 00:02:47.259
You’re seriously doing this?

00:03:00.184 --> 00:03:01.120
Who’s there?

00:04:31.965 --> 00:04:32.815
Who’s there?

00:05:23.864 --> 00:05:25.148
Do you think she’s gone?

00:05:26.472 --> 00:05:28.580
She should be waiting just out front.

00:05:38.641 --> 00:05:39.578
What are you doing?

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:50.851
Hello.

00:05:51.068 --> 00:05:52.099
Hello, teacher.

00:05:53.116 --> 00:05:54.140
I’m Ayan.

00:05:55.233 --> 00:06:02.094
I’m not sure if I mistakenly included my History assignment in your English assignment this evening.

00:06:02.865 --> 00:06:04.865
Ah, I don’t know.

00:06:04.985 --> 00:06:08.200
If I find it, I’ll hand it to Teacher Waree for you.

00:06:09.896 --> 00:06:11.657
I still need to work on it a little more.

00:06:12.257 --> 00:06:13.866
Or Teacher Waree will yell at me.

00:06:14.765 --> 00:06:17.611
May I please ask you to check it for me?

00:06:26.929 --> 00:06:27.846
All right.

00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:29.160
I’ll take a look.

00:06:31.007 --> 00:06:31.892
Yes, ma’am.

00:06:32.087 --> 00:06:33.007
Thank you.

00:06:52.024 --> 00:06:53.068
Oh, it’s you.

00:06:54.653 --> 00:06:55.609
So you’ve come back.

00:06:56.005 --> 00:06:56.822
Right.

00:06:57.299 --> 00:06:59.133
I’m here to work on some documents.

00:07:04.272 --> 00:07:05.560
Why are you still here?

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.499
Ah,

00:07:08.345 --> 00:07:09.783
I came to look for a student's assignment.

00:07:09.783 --> 00:07:11.177
He mistakenly turned in the wrong one.

00:07:13.034 --> 00:07:14.130
I’ll be leaving now.

00:07:15.606 --> 00:07:16.597
Goodbye, sir.

00:07:50.533 --> 00:07:52.533
[Teacher Sani]

00:07:54.971 --> 00:07:56.040
It’s Teacher Sani.

00:08:04.134 --> 00:08:05.065
Yes, ma’am.

00:08:05.421 --> 00:08:07.421
I couldn’t find your assignment.

00:08:07.709 --> 00:08:09.123
Maybe you left it somewhere else?

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.900
Ah!

00:08:11.942 --> 00:08:13.640
It’s with Akk.

00:08:14.472 --> 00:08:15.930
He just called and told me.

00:08:16.501 --> 00:08:18.501
I was about to call you, Teacher.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.920
Okay then.

00:08:35.358 --> 00:08:36.837
Almost busted.

00:08:42.415 --> 00:08:43.214
Thank you.

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.921
I’ll go home then.

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.136
Hold on.

00:08:51.566 --> 00:08:53.050
We’ve got something to talk about.

00:09:03.683 --> 00:09:04.384
Akk.

00:09:06.359 --> 00:09:07.138
Akk.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:17.739
Are you the one who brought back the Suppalo curse?

00:09:20.042 --> 00:09:20.739
What are you saying?

00:09:20.739 --> 00:09:22.042
The truth, Akk.

00:09:24.127 --> 00:09:25.628
Can you tell me the truth?

00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:30.361
You can talk to me.

00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:33.446
If I want to expose you,

00:09:34.596 --> 00:09:36.535
I’d have done it the first day I met you.

00:09:42.712 --> 00:09:45.211
I saw you wait until Mr. Sit went to his room.

00:09:48.524 --> 00:09:49.591
And you did it.

00:09:52.075 --> 00:09:54.075
When the pickup truck started moving,

00:09:55.232 --> 00:09:57.623
you went back to take the prefect role,

00:09:58.534 --> 00:09:59.644
the rule keeper role.

00:10:05.576 --> 00:10:07.291
The more I trace it,

00:10:08.571 --> 00:10:10.049
the clearer I see

00:10:12.898 --> 00:10:15.571
that the one who brought back the Suppalo curse

00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:18.468
is you.

00:10:23.315 --> 00:10:25.489
Can you tell me the truth, Akk?

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:28.333
I don’t want the school's reputation to be ruined

00:10:29.352 --> 00:10:30.720
while I’m the head of the Prefect Club.

00:10:30.894 --> 00:10:32.177
I mean I’m worried.

00:10:33.453 --> 00:10:35.000
You know what Aye is like.

00:10:39.273 --> 00:10:39.959
Hey!

00:10:41.087 --> 00:10:42.054
What’s the matter?

00:11:11.723 --> 00:11:13.207
Why did you do it?

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:21.538
To uphold Suppalo’s rules.

00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:26.424
Can you tell me the truth, Akk?

00:11:32.593 --> 00:11:34.757
I don’t want the school's reputation to be ruined

00:11:35.668 --> 00:11:37.012
while I’m the head of the Prefect Club.

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:42.365
You maintain goodness

00:11:42.810 --> 00:11:44.365
and peace

00:11:45.416 --> 00:11:46.850
by doing all those shitty things, Akk?

00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:47.981
I just wanted them to stop.

00:11:57.291 --> 00:11:58.635
I never wish to hurt anyone.

00:12:01.872 --> 00:12:05.770
But what you did was a crime.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.895
What if someone died?

00:12:09.649 --> 00:12:11.016
What would you do?

00:12:14.512 --> 00:12:16.090
Could you take responsibility?

00:12:49.223 --> 00:12:50.848
I just try to do my best.

00:12:52.422 --> 00:12:53.953
I want everything to turn out the best.

00:12:55.363 --> 00:12:58.746
I just want things to be great.

00:12:58.746 --> 00:12:59.909
Akk.

00:13:01.044 --> 00:13:02.435
Akk, look at me.

00:13:03.024 --> 00:13:04.055
Look into my eyes.

00:13:04.805 --> 00:13:05.774
Look into my eyes.

00:13:07.022 --> 00:13:07.878
Akk!

00:13:08.511 --> 00:13:09.444
Akk!

00:13:10.514 --> 00:13:11.741
Look into my eyes.

00:13:14.838 --> 00:13:16.838
Nothing is the best.

00:13:18.323 --> 00:13:24.119
You can’t carry all the school problems on your shoulder.

00:13:26.179 --> 00:13:27.232
Do you get it?

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:29.650
But I must do it.

00:13:31.211 --> 00:13:32.822
If I can’t do it,

00:13:33.994 --> 00:13:35.530
everyone will be disappointed in me.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:37.543
Screw those people.

00:13:39.172 --> 00:13:41.055
Can you just not give a shit about them?

00:13:42.746 --> 00:13:44.863
Put yourself first, Akk.

00:13:47.282 --> 00:13:48.469
I can’t!

00:13:49.969 --> 00:13:50.650
Akk.

00:14:06.611 --> 00:14:09.783
Once you say you care about other people’s feelings,

00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:15.090
it means you are disregarding your own feelings.

00:14:26.188 --> 00:14:27.570
But I can’t.

00:14:30.792 --> 00:14:32.370
Because I’m a student prefect.

00:14:47.419 --> 00:14:49.419
You’re allowed to be weak.

00:14:55.823 --> 00:14:57.542
At least with me.

00:15:04.143 --> 00:15:05.530
It’s okay, Akk.

00:15:28.083 --> 00:15:28.940
I have to go.

00:15:30.861 --> 00:15:31.676
Akk.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:42.054
Akk.

00:15:43.788 --> 00:15:45.074
Akk, wait up.

00:15:47.604 --> 00:15:48.573
Talk to me.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.237
What do you want from me?

00:15:50.506 --> 00:15:51.756
Tell me.

00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.330
Did Teacher Chadok order you to do all that?

00:15:56.921 --> 00:15:57.815
Did he, Akk?

00:16:01.307 --> 00:16:02.038
No.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:04.439
I did it of my own free will.

00:16:05.681 --> 00:16:06.626
He has nothing to do with it.

00:16:07.121 --> 00:16:09.004
Why are you protecting him?

00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:10.530
I’m not.

00:16:12.136 --> 00:16:13.550
It’s all me.

00:16:13.550 --> 00:16:14.868
What the heck is wrong with you, Akk?

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:16.849
Have you been brainwashed?

00:16:20.181 --> 00:16:21.712
You must stop it.

00:16:23.754 --> 00:16:25.004
Or I’ll expose you.

00:16:27.609 --> 00:16:28.929
Do you want your life to be ruined?

00:16:30.902 --> 00:16:32.199
Don’t tell anyone.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:34.770
I don’t want my parents to be disappointed.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.214
Promise me then.

00:16:37.883 --> 00:16:38.664
Can you do it?

00:16:42.528 --> 00:16:43.790
Give me your word.

00:16:47.633 --> 00:16:48.371
Fine.

00:16:49.025 --> 00:16:49.850
I’ll stop.

00:16:50.717 --> 00:16:51.798
Happy now?

00:16:54.828 --> 00:16:56.500
Return me my notebook.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:58.730
What notebook now?

00:16:59.023 --> 00:17:01.023
You said you believed I didn’t take it.

00:17:01.512 --> 00:17:02.879
I used to believe so, Akk.

00:17:03.727 --> 00:17:06.617
But from what I saw today, I changed my mind.

00:17:07.602 --> 00:17:08.467
What?

00:17:08.725 --> 00:17:09.766
What is wrong with you?

00:17:16.091 --> 00:17:16.895
Hey!

00:17:17.330 --> 00:17:18.315
What’s the matter?

00:17:19.962 --> 00:17:20.930
I…

00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:29.123
Does your stomach usually rumble this loud when you’re hungry?

00:17:47.389 --> 00:17:49.389
[Grilled Chicken, Papaya Salad, Grilled Fish.]

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.939
Wat!

00:18:08.517 --> 00:18:10.368
Hey, Teacher.

00:18:15.287 --> 00:18:16.818
Lucky for us the rain has stopped.

00:18:17.009 --> 00:18:18.490
Or we wouldn’t get any table.

00:18:19.521 --> 00:18:20.244
True.

00:18:26.426 --> 00:18:28.426
You seem to like this type of food.

00:18:29.534 --> 00:18:30.530
Very much.

00:18:31.381 --> 00:18:34.553
I don’t usually get to eat this kind of food.

00:18:36.389 --> 00:18:37.353
Why not?

00:18:40.282 --> 00:18:43.404
My mom is pretty health-conscious.

00:18:43.769 --> 00:18:45.933
She only eats clean and healthy food.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:53.634
Why are you out filming by yourself?

00:18:55.530 --> 00:18:58.850
Whenever I’m out filming,

00:18:59.291 --> 00:19:02.228
Akk and Kan always refuse to come along.

00:19:03.553 --> 00:19:04.470
Yeah?

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.272
Yes, ma’am.

00:19:05.674 --> 00:19:07.674
Oh, Teacher,

00:19:08.017 --> 00:19:11.517
I’m learning how to use a video editing program.

00:19:11.879 --> 00:19:13.530
Do you want to see my edited video, ma’am?

00:19:14.539 --> 00:19:15.504
Of course.

00:19:15.855 --> 00:19:16.726
Let me show you.

00:19:18.554 --> 00:19:19.393
Here.

00:19:37.887 --> 00:19:40.379
I’ve never seen this side of the student prefect team.

00:19:41.910 --> 00:19:45.199
Actually, we’re nutheads.

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.107
I can imagine Kanlong as one.

00:19:49.794 --> 00:19:50.966
Akk, on the other hand.

00:19:51.622 --> 00:19:52.544
Didn’t expect it.

00:19:55.288 --> 00:19:59.022
Akk is bonkers when he’s surrounded by close friends.

00:20:05.034 --> 00:20:07.315
What is he like? Akk, I mean.

00:20:08.409 --> 00:20:10.643
He’s a good leader.

00:20:11.704 --> 00:20:13.563
He always puts other people before himself.

00:20:14.203 --> 00:20:17.234
But he can be a little weak-minded sometimes.

00:20:19.857 --> 00:20:21.857
Especially with Teacher Chadok, isn’t it?

00:20:22.056 --> 00:20:22.847
Right.

00:20:23.152 --> 00:20:25.111
Teacher Chadok is his idol.

00:20:26.518 --> 00:20:27.611
Is that so?

00:20:32.249 --> 00:20:34.410
I want to know more about your group.

00:20:34.846 --> 00:20:36.705
Can you tell me more?

00:20:38.373 --> 00:20:39.483
Absolutely, ma’am.

00:21:04.938 --> 00:21:05.795
Drink this.

00:21:07.107 --> 00:21:08.414
Thank you.

00:21:10.344 --> 00:21:11.922
We’re almost done.

00:21:12.051 --> 00:21:14.449
Try to memorize them.

00:21:14.686 --> 00:21:16.827
So that you can answer questions when we have the presentation.

00:21:17.305 --> 00:21:18.180
Yeah.

00:21:19.051 --> 00:21:20.746
I think we have too many assignments to do.

00:21:21.406 --> 00:21:23.875
Why don’t the teachers just talk before assigning us homework?

00:21:26.647 --> 00:21:27.967
It’s our duty.

00:21:28.112 --> 00:21:29.432
We must do it no matter what.

00:21:31.217 --> 00:21:34.881
Because it's our duty, you're here working at my house.

00:21:37.377 --> 00:21:39.799
Because all your family members went out of town,

00:21:40.257 --> 00:21:43.101
you tricked me to come and keep you company.

00:21:44.882 --> 00:21:46.788
Smart enough to be the head of the class.

00:21:47.448 --> 00:21:48.956
It’s good we’re here.

00:21:49.663 --> 00:21:51.288
It’s near the eclipse.

00:21:51.831 --> 00:21:54.170
If you stay in school, you might be cursed.

00:21:54.485 --> 00:21:56.766
I’m not a protestor. Why would I be cursed?

00:21:56.766 --> 00:21:58.723
Because you’re always with Aye. I’m jealous.

00:22:06.878 --> 00:22:08.386
I mean I’m worried.

00:22:09.574 --> 00:22:11.176
You know what he’s like.

00:22:25.531 --> 00:22:26.535
Hi, Mom.

00:22:28.292 --> 00:22:30.085
Is that so?

00:22:32.194 --> 00:22:33.181
Okay, Mom.

00:22:37.154 --> 00:22:38.053
What is it?

00:22:40.413 --> 00:22:41.177
Nothing.

00:22:41.364 --> 00:22:45.530
My mom can’t pick me up so my stepdad will.

00:22:46.911 --> 00:22:49.380
But you said you’re uncomfortable around him.

00:22:53.387 --> 00:22:54.098
Yeah.

00:23:03.823 --> 00:23:04.656
Hide.

00:23:04.656 --> 00:23:05.823
Do it!

00:23:13.346 --> 00:23:14.315
What are you doing?

00:23:14.315 --> 00:23:14.968
Wear it.

00:23:14.968 --> 00:23:18.370
If he is doing anything, let me know.

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:19.600
I heard that.

00:23:42.764 --> 00:23:44.121
When you eat,

00:23:44.609 --> 00:23:46.859
you leave out your student prefect aura.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:52.473
Can you not poke your nose in my business for once?

00:23:55.384 --> 00:23:57.119
Mr. Nice Mouth has finally come back.

00:23:57.795 --> 00:23:59.023
This is so you.

00:24:02.726 --> 00:24:03.905
You finished. Go home.

00:24:04.027 --> 00:24:04.889
What are you waiting for?

00:24:06.574 --> 00:24:09.103
Waiting for you to take me to my notebook.

00:24:11.633 --> 00:24:12.901
Notebook again?

00:24:13.096 --> 00:24:14.791
Don’t you understand human language?

00:24:16.358 --> 00:24:18.236
You must take me to every place to look for it.

00:24:18.457 --> 00:24:19.341
In school.

00:24:19.606 --> 00:24:20.641
The locker area.

00:24:21.038 --> 00:24:21.881
Your dorm.

00:24:23.468 --> 00:24:24.625
What is your problem?

00:24:25.256 --> 00:24:29.087
I’ll turn every place upside down until I find it.

00:24:29.575 --> 00:24:30.315
Okay?

00:24:39.416 --> 00:24:40.846
That’s my meatball.

00:24:41.072 --> 00:24:41.782
You want it back?

00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:43.987
Take it from my mouth.

00:24:47.392 --> 00:24:48.415
Spit it out.

00:25:01.825 --> 00:25:03.581
This is complimentary.

00:25:03.581 --> 00:25:05.476
You’re two growing boys. Eat as much as you can.

00:25:05.841 --> 00:25:07.109
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.043
Continue bickering. It’s cute.

00:25:12.775 --> 00:25:14.256
Are you guys just a ship or real?

00:25:16.734 --> 00:25:20.256
Auntie, he and I are friends.

00:25:21.399 --> 00:25:22.616
More than friends.

00:25:23.566 --> 00:25:25.200
- More than friends.
- More than friends.

00:25:25.468 --> 00:25:28.017
More than friends, less than lovers.

00:25:28.534 --> 00:25:29.250
Cute.

00:25:29.331 --> 00:25:30.416
More than friends.

00:25:30.416 --> 00:25:31.433
Make yourselves comfortable.

00:25:31.433 --> 00:25:32.975
- Sure.
- More than friends.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.246
Aunties.

00:25:36.392 --> 00:25:37.802
We really are friends.

00:25:37.802 --> 00:25:39.551
Don’t be shy.

00:25:39.973 --> 00:25:40.535
I’ve seen a lot.

00:25:40.535 --> 00:25:41.208
Aunties!

00:25:55.639 --> 00:25:57.301
Come on. Share that meatball.

00:26:05.741 --> 00:26:06.653
What?

00:26:07.385 --> 00:26:08.636
The three Jums are here.

00:26:11.491 --> 00:26:12.179
Oh,

00:26:12.321 --> 00:26:13.714
they’re with their boyfriends.

00:26:14.792 --> 00:26:15.614
Stop it.

00:26:16.543 --> 00:26:17.542
What do you think you’re doing?

00:26:18.173 --> 00:26:19.968
Do you want them to know we came together?

00:26:20.878 --> 00:26:21.702
So?

00:26:21.987 --> 00:26:23.216
What’s the problem if they know?

00:26:24.719 --> 00:26:26.174
Come here.

00:26:26.479 --> 00:26:27.797
Akk, where are you taking me?

00:26:27.797 --> 00:26:28.490
Akk!

00:26:34.337 --> 00:26:35.198
Hide.

00:26:35.736 --> 00:26:36.519
Hide!

00:26:36.865 --> 00:26:37.529
Do it.

00:26:47.616 --> 00:26:50.430
Nian, Nong, take different tables.

00:26:50.532 --> 00:26:51.912
We don’t share the same table tonight.

00:27:00.571 --> 00:27:01.543
Your body is pretty warm.

00:27:04.147 --> 00:27:05.277
You’re such a pain.

00:27:06.744 --> 00:27:07.750
Aren’t you afraid anymore?

00:27:09.073 --> 00:27:09.762
Come closer.

00:27:10.956 --> 00:27:12.834
After we get away from here, you’re in trouble.

00:27:14.979 --> 00:27:16.247
Get down.

00:27:25.437 --> 00:27:26.684
Can you share it?

00:27:26.684 --> 00:27:27.867
Sure.

00:27:43.032 --> 00:27:44.503
Thua, have you finished?

00:27:44.712 --> 00:27:45.700
Hurry up.

00:27:46.188 --> 00:27:47.200
Yes, Dad.

00:27:55.616 --> 00:27:56.516
Hello, sir.

00:28:01.013 --> 00:28:03.212
Let’s go. Your mom is waiting for dinner.

00:28:06.044 --> 00:28:09.224
If he is doing anything, let me know.

00:28:09.577 --> 00:28:10.540
I’ll deal with him for you.

00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:11.577
I heard that.

00:28:12.632 --> 00:28:13.897
Who is dealing with who?

00:28:16.339 --> 00:28:17.074
Sorry.

00:28:18.746 --> 00:28:20.056
Hurry. Your mom is waiting.

00:28:20.626 --> 00:28:21.420
Yes.

00:28:41.758 --> 00:28:43.758
[Once you get home, let me know.]
[Did your stepdad say anything?]

00:28:43.758 --> 00:28:44.675
Was that your boyfriend?

00:28:45.916 --> 00:28:46.694
No.

00:28:48.559 --> 00:28:49.888
Just admit it.

00:28:50.259 --> 00:28:51.354
We live in a new age here.

00:28:56.054 --> 00:28:57.216
How was school?

00:28:58.691 --> 00:29:00.060
Just the same.

00:29:04.004 --> 00:29:05.658
Can I turn on the radio?

00:29:05.658 --> 00:29:06.301
Yeah.

00:29:08.557 --> 00:29:09.743
(Hi, everyone.)

00:29:10.449 --> 00:29:13.896
(Tonight's short news is on the solar eclipse.)

00:29:14.505 --> 00:29:18.377
(For those of you who are waiting to see the solar eclipse…)

00:29:18.377 --> 00:29:19.179
Just turn that off.

00:29:20.522 --> 00:29:22.359
This nonsense solar eclipse thing.

00:29:22.359 --> 00:29:26.003
(National Astronomical Research Institute of Thailand is advising…)

00:29:26.003 --> 00:29:26.745
Sure.

00:29:29.854 --> 00:29:30.755
Let’s go home.

00:29:36.954 --> 00:29:39.686
Wat, Thua’s dad is freaking intimidating.

00:29:40.050 --> 00:29:41.399
Do you think he will hurt him?

00:29:42.617 --> 00:29:45.838
Thua seems soft but he’s not stupid.

00:29:46.436 --> 00:29:47.887
He can surely survive.

00:29:48.237 --> 00:29:49.203
Don’t worry about him.

00:29:49.203 --> 00:29:50.400
I can’t help it.

00:29:50.521 --> 00:29:52.847
You should have seen his stepdad like I just did.

00:29:53.067 --> 00:29:56.576
You seem so worried about Thua these days. It’s weird.

00:29:58.752 --> 00:29:59.545
Weird?

00:29:59.687 --> 00:30:00.894
No, I’m not being weird. Just typical me.

00:30:01.149 --> 00:30:04.376
You didn’t even want to walk past him back then.

00:30:04.376 --> 00:30:08.336
You were so afraid people would say you two are the legendary boyfriends.

00:30:08.336 --> 00:30:09.510
What are you rambling about?

00:30:09.777 --> 00:30:11.879
Just work on your nonsense short film, man.

00:30:12.245 --> 00:30:12.994
Bye.

00:30:24.835 --> 00:30:26.296
Kanlong, stop!

00:30:26.296 --> 00:30:27.617
You needed your wife to rescue you?

00:30:31.258 --> 00:30:32.616
Thua, be gentler.

00:30:33.121 --> 00:30:34.775
Don’t you move.

00:30:44.711 --> 00:30:46.182
Kan, seriously.

00:30:46.707 --> 00:30:50.884
Are you actually angry with those guys or me?

00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:02.902
How can I be angry with you, Thua?

00:31:19.191 --> 00:31:19.927
What are you doing?

00:31:19.927 --> 00:31:20.967
Just wear it.

00:31:21.354 --> 00:31:22.164
Why?

00:31:22.164 --> 00:31:23.088
Just wear it.

00:31:24.146 --> 00:31:25.006
Why?

00:31:25.566 --> 00:31:27.616
You disguise yourself and talk to the guard.

00:31:27.616 --> 00:31:29.209
I’ll be on the other side.

00:31:30.006 --> 00:31:30.905
Okay?

00:31:37.434 --> 00:31:38.213
Let’s go.

00:31:40.055 --> 00:31:40.904
Come here.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:43.176
Where?

00:31:43.713 --> 00:31:45.611
Ayan, come here.

00:31:47.471 --> 00:31:48.646
Mister.

00:31:51.515 --> 00:31:52.340
Who is it?

00:31:57.403 --> 00:31:59.790
I forgot my assignment due tomorrow inside.

00:31:59.996 --> 00:32:01.096
Can I go inside and grab it?

00:32:02.617 --> 00:32:03.578
Sure, prefect.

00:32:03.856 --> 00:32:05.221
But please make it quick.

00:32:05.442 --> 00:32:08.134
If the head of the guards finds out, I’ll be in trouble.

00:32:08.331 --> 00:32:09.116
Of course.

00:32:09.828 --> 00:32:10.776
Let me get the door for you.

00:32:18.308 --> 00:32:19.465
Please hurry up.

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:20.573
Thank you so much.

00:32:24.792 --> 00:32:26.792
You made it like a diamond heist.

00:32:27.537 --> 00:32:29.171
You come with me. You can just walk in.

00:32:29.474 --> 00:32:30.485
Right. You’re so smart.

00:32:30.872 --> 00:32:32.064
Lead the way then.

00:32:39.977 --> 00:32:40.890
Spread out your arms.

00:32:41.684 --> 00:32:42.771
What are you doing?

00:32:42.771 --> 00:32:43.890
Just spread out your arms.

00:32:47.182 --> 00:32:49.263
You must open your friends’ lockers too.

00:32:49.921 --> 00:32:51.514
How can I do that? I don’t have the keys.

00:32:51.711 --> 00:32:53.284
How could you open mine then?

00:33:18.147 --> 00:33:20.147
I told you I didn’t take it.

00:33:33.066 --> 00:33:35.066
Why would you want my notebook?

00:33:35.898 --> 00:33:38.561
I wanted it but I didn’t take it.

00:33:38.561 --> 00:33:42.621
Nobody in this damn school can be trusted.

00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:46.939
Why is the notebook so important to you?

00:33:55.128 --> 00:33:56.441
Take me to the lockers.

00:34:11.281 --> 00:34:12.476
Open yours.

00:34:37.654 --> 00:34:38.730
We should go.

00:34:39.298 --> 00:34:40.222
Not yet.

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:43.170
You must open your friends’ lockers too.

00:34:44.446 --> 00:34:45.664
How can I do that? I don’t have the keys.

00:34:45.664 --> 00:34:47.002
How did you open mine then?

00:34:47.442 --> 00:34:48.456
You forgot to lock it.

00:34:48.456 --> 00:34:49.300
I did?

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.304
Yes, you did.

00:34:50.427 --> 00:34:52.048
- Meow!
- Shit!

00:34:53.858 --> 00:34:55.158
Why so jumpy?

00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:56.639
It’s just a cat.

00:34:56.639 --> 00:34:57.785
And you’re such a big guy.

00:34:57.930 --> 00:34:59.196
I’m not jumpy.

00:35:01.508 --> 00:35:04.313
I shouted to scare it away so that it won’t mess with anything in here.

00:35:04.465 --> 00:35:05.390
Oh, yeah?

00:35:05.390 --> 00:35:06.157
Yeah!

00:35:06.505 --> 00:35:08.122
What about that hug?

00:35:08.727 --> 00:35:09.771
Hug, my ass!

00:35:10.197 --> 00:35:11.721
I was protecting you.

00:35:12.143 --> 00:35:13.385
I was afraid it would scratch you.

00:35:13.563 --> 00:35:14.900
Wow!

00:35:15.281 --> 00:35:19.318
You’re just perfect to be the head of the Prefect Club.

00:35:20.101 --> 00:35:21.675
Outstanding.

00:35:22.103 --> 00:35:23.027
Time to go.

00:35:23.524 --> 00:35:24.434
Wait.

00:35:25.523 --> 00:35:27.202
If I can’t find it in places,

00:35:28.970 --> 00:35:30.337
it’s probably on your body.

00:35:30.522 --> 00:35:31.558
What are you getting at now?

00:35:31.803 --> 00:35:32.847
Spread out your arms.

00:35:35.405 --> 00:35:36.361
What are you doing?

00:35:36.479 --> 00:35:37.712
Just spread out your arms.

00:35:50.986 --> 00:35:52.299
Enough already.

00:36:05.891 --> 00:36:07.180
Have you found it, prefect?

00:36:08.841 --> 00:36:09.774
We have.

00:36:09.774 --> 00:36:10.841
We’re about to leave.

00:36:11.067 --> 00:36:12.309
All right.

00:36:15.331 --> 00:36:16.325
Are you happy now?

00:36:16.325 --> 00:36:17.023
No.

00:36:17.949 --> 00:36:19.949
You must take me to one last stop.

00:36:24.143 --> 00:36:25.196
Lock that locker.

00:37:04.571 --> 00:37:06.162
Put them all back to their places.

00:37:07.331 --> 00:37:10.322
If you don’t want me to go through your stuff, tell me where it is.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:12.677
I told you I don’t have it.

00:37:13.129 --> 00:37:14.722
Just go home.

00:37:21.052 --> 00:37:22.413
I said I don’t have it.

00:37:22.842 --> 00:37:23.835
Go home already.

00:37:24.427 --> 00:37:25.434
I won’t go

00:37:25.801 --> 00:37:27.322
until I find it.

00:37:27.424 --> 00:37:28.363
I’ll crash here tonight.

00:37:29.121 --> 00:37:31.042
If you don’t cooperate,

00:37:32.575 --> 00:37:34.196
I’ll reveal your story.

00:37:37.522 --> 00:37:39.380
Why are you so stubborn?

00:37:48.261 --> 00:37:49.444
Yes, Mom.

00:37:49.444 --> 00:37:51.279
We will do a group report at home.

00:37:51.557 --> 00:37:54.125
Wat also said he’d film some kind of video there.

00:37:59.948 --> 00:38:01.072
Hold on a second, Mom.

00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.338
Hi, I’m back.

00:38:10.523 --> 00:38:12.239
It’s going to be four of us.

00:38:12.359 --> 00:38:16.135
I think I might be one day ahead of them as I want to help you prepare the guest rooms.

00:38:16.412 --> 00:38:18.412
We will spend one or two nights.

00:38:19.383 --> 00:38:20.292
Yes.

00:38:20.908 --> 00:38:21.999
I miss you guys.

00:38:22.282 --> 00:38:23.429
See you.

00:38:23.923 --> 00:38:26.278
You’re a cutie when you talk to your parents.

00:38:27.506 --> 00:38:29.082
You’re not like that with me.

00:38:33.013 --> 00:38:34.378
Are you my parent?

00:38:40.512 --> 00:38:41.431
That’s your spot.

00:38:41.431 --> 00:38:42.062
Sleep.

00:38:56.391 --> 00:38:57.728
Turn off the light. I’ll sleep now.

00:39:08.645 --> 00:39:10.042
Stay away. You’re giving me goosebumps.

00:39:28.271 --> 00:39:30.129
You refuse to let me sleep in the same bed

00:39:30.827 --> 00:39:32.709
because you’re thinking dirty, aren’t you?

00:39:36.027 --> 00:39:37.129
I’m not.

00:39:39.711 --> 00:39:40.964
Then let me sleep here.

00:39:41.535 --> 00:39:42.919
Go ahead.

00:40:05.501 --> 00:40:07.501
Come any closer and I’ll punch you.

00:40:09.182 --> 00:40:10.162
Will you?

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.713
(I’ll kiss you.)

00:41:08.157 --> 00:41:09.068
Uncle.

00:41:21.195 --> 00:41:22.058
Uncle.

00:41:53.599 --> 00:41:55.599
No!

00:41:58.416 --> 00:41:59.350
Uncle!

00:42:03.013 --> 00:42:04.539
Uncle.

00:42:13.959 --> 00:42:15.522
Don’t!

00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:17.927
Uncle!

00:42:18.298 --> 00:42:19.173
Uncle!

00:42:19.741 --> 00:42:21.422
Uncle.

Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

00:44:30.445 --> 00:44:33.962
Sometimes I wonder why those people don’t think like us.

00:44:33.962 --> 00:44:35.717
The prefects’ duty

00:44:35.717 --> 00:44:38.464
is to do whatever it takes to make Suppalo remain Suppalo.

00:44:38.835 --> 00:44:40.267
I hope you don’t forget that.

00:44:40.411 --> 00:44:42.222
Do you remember what you said to me?

00:44:42.222 --> 00:44:43.484
You’re allowed to be weak.
