98
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,519
You know, like when an artist finishes a painting

99
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,104
and puts their signature in the corner.

100

(pants)

174
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:16,553
Is that why... I can see what that person is seeing?

175
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,849
(breathing shakily)

176
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,853
(sighs)

177
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,730
I should have taken both eyes back then.

178
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,651
(breathes deeply)

179
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,071
(breathing shakily)

180
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,497
(sighs deeply)

181
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,669
(grunts)

182
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:02,182
(Dongsoo groans)

183
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,358
(fireworks whistle)

184
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,444
(fireworks crackle)

185
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,083
SEOHAN CITY, A LARGE CROWD GATHER AT "SAMJI PORT FIREWORKS FESTIVAL"

186
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:34,381
(sighs)

187
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:37,009
(chuckles)

188
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:41,180
Goddamn it. Fuck. This is the worst.

189
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,516
(sighs)

190
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,073
DETECTIVE PARK: First victim, Kim Hyemi.

191
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,450
FIRST VICTIM: KIM HYEMI VICTIM 1 KIM HYEMI

192
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,534
SECOND VICTIM: PARK YONGSEOK VICTIM 2 PARK YONGSEOK

193
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,870
Second victim, Park Yongseok.

194
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,541
DETECTIVE CHOI: There's nothing that connects the two cases.

195
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:15,422
Neither case looks like it was caused by grudge.

196
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:22,304
Man, we were just digging up info on Kim Hyemi for nothing.

197
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:23,722
VICTIM KIM HYEMI AGE: 22 / OCCUPATION: COLLEGE STUDENT

198
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:26,266
I mean, if young women were the only targets,

199
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,103
we could approach it as a typical crazy sex offender case.

200
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:31,355
(inhales deeply)

201
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,815
But they killed the victim with so much care and effort

202
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,610
and decorated the victim like an artwork.

203
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,488
This sick psycho...

204
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,407
Even the crowd thought it was an art display.

205
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:47,246
They embalmed the body, angled it perfectly...

206
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,873
(inhales deeply)

207
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:52,000
...and even used resin to coat the body.

208
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,293
(scoffs)

209
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,797
(inhales sharply)

210
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,678
They made a tear in the flesh and deliberately let the blood drip?

211
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:06,848
Could this be intentional or a mistake?

212
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,935
Did they want to show off?

213
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,395
(sighs)

214
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:16,441
Ah, if only Detective Choi could sniff out some kind of lead,

215
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:19,194
that would be great.

216
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:22,864
You haven't had nosebleed yet, right?

217
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,825
Nosebleed? What is that?

218
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:29,705
Huh? Nosebleed is nosebleed. This guy is curious about so many things.

219
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,040
Let me show you. (clears throat) Here.

220
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,336
When he comes across a lead that makes him think "this is it,"

221
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,464
his nose bleeds.

222
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,424
(all giggle)

223
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:42,551
-Why is that? -DETECTIVE CHOI: Hey, come on.

224
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,804
Well, it's not like you can hide it.

225
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,181
Oh, his grandmother is a big-time shaman.

226
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,352
Many of his relatives are too. It runs in the family, right?

227
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,814
Is it fun? Making your supervisor look weird?

228
00:21:56,523 --> 00:22:00,027
Go ask forensics for the resin component analysis

229
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:03,864
then find out the purchase route and seller.

230
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,198
-DETECTIVE 1: Yes, sir. -DETECTIVE 2: Yes, sir.

231
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,575
DETECTIVE 3: Yes.

232
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,329
JUNK SHOP

233
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:16,835
(grunts)

234
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,608
(crackles)

235
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:44,738
He should have already been back by now but I still haven't heard from him.

236
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:48,533
What could he be doing out there? (sighs)

237
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,411
He could have waited a few days for the car repair.

238
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:55,290
Oh, my. But he just couldn't wait and went out with his handcart.

239
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,215
I'll go find him.

240
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,973
(clatters in distance)

241
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,565
(dog barking in distance)

242
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,527
STUDENT 1: Go ahead and say something, damn it.

243
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:28,281
MAN: I was out of strength and I lost grip. I made a mistake, okay?

244
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,449
(student scoffs)

245
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,952
I'm sorry, okay? I am sorry.

246
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:36,373
I mean, you just hit a person, so you have to apologize. That's a given.

247
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,999
-STUDENT 2: Huh? -MAN: Yeah.

248
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:41,086
If you're broke, can you kill someone and then just say "I'm sorry"?

249
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,004
-STUDENT 2: Damn it. -MAN: Come on, please, ah...

250
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:44,673
"Sorry" doesn't cut it!

251
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,633
I'm begging you like this, please.

252
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,968
Now, what is this? I don't need this.

253
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,553
(laughing) STUDENTS: Whoa.

254
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:51,972
STUDENT 2: I mean he's not even listening to me.

255
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:54,266
What are you all doing right now?

256
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,184
Sir.

257
00:23:56,977 --> 00:24:01,273
Hey, what are you doing here? Go back.

258
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:04,651
No, how could I? What do you think you're doing right now?

259
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,654
-Damn it, let's go. Quickly. -(grunting)

260
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,449
Huh? Wait, where do you think you're going?

261
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,201
I'm talking to the man who just hit me and tried to run away.

262
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,620
Hey, do you want to die?

263
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,876
Hey, look how scared this guy looks. Man, you're scared as heck, aren't you?

264
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,002
(all laugh)

265
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,713
-Hurry up and go. -I'll call the police.

266
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,173
That little...

267
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,717
(student 2 groans)

268
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,053
(Dongsoo grunts)

269
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,181
-STUDENT 2: Come out, come out. -STUDENT 1: Out, out, out, out.

270
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,183
STUDENT 3: Knuckle ball kick!

271
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,767
Get off me, you son of a bitch.

272
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,228
-STUDENT 2: You little... -(Dongsoo groans)

273
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:45,066
(Dongsoo grunts)

274
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,110
(indistinct chatter)

275
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,445
(groans)

276
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:49,988
(student 1 breathes deeply)

277
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,786
(Dongsoo pants)

278
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,623
-STUDENT 3: Oh, oh. -STUDENT 1: Where are you going?

279
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,333
(students snicker)

280
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,376
(student 1 scoffs) You ready to get stabbed?

281
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,046
(students laugh)

282
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:10,300
(breathing shakily)

283
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,597
STUDENT 3: He's trembling. See that? Do you see that? Huh?

284
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,603
(student 2 murmuring)

285
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,063
This bastard!

286
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:32,030
(student grunt)

287
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,825
You crazy bastard, why didn't you move? Damn it.

288
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,832
(students moan)

289
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:43,917
STUDENT 3: Hey...

290
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:46,920
(groans)

291
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,174
Let's just stop here, okay?

292
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,218
(student 2 grunts)

293
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,388
Hey, this bastard. A monster...

294
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,639
GIRL 1: Monster.

295
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,683
BOY: Monster.

296
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,060
GIRL: Mo... Monster.

297
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:05,897
STUDENT 3: He's a monster!

298
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,482
(students grunt)

299
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,359
I'm not!

300
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,236
(breathing shakily)

301
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,453
(moans)

302
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,503
(groans)

303
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,509
(grunts)

304
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,765
(pants)

305
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:48,607
(moans)

306
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,318
(breathing heavily)

307
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,617
(pants)

308
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,416
STUDENT 3: Hurry up, damn it.

309
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:09,753
STUDENT 2: Hey, hey, hey, hey, let's just call the cops, come on.

310
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:12,130
Oh, stop it. That old man went to call the police.

311
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,132
Oh, let's just fucking go, okay?

312
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,259
Hey, did you see that bastard was missing an eye? So gross.

313
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,552
-Oh, the eye. -Oh, man.

314
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:19,012
Hey, stop!

315
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,812
(both groan)

316
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:29,356
What was it that you saw?

317
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:31,232
KARAOKE

318
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:34,903
MR. KIM: So he sure hasn't left this town, huh?

319
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,707
Keep looking. Finding that bastard is most important.

320
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,750
ALL: Yes, sir.

321
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,138
MINSOOK: Why are you all just standing around?

322
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:04,933
MINSOOK (on radio): You heard him. Go look for him.

323
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:15,151
Man, what a halfwit.

324
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,030
What are you doing, losing a game?

325
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,459
(deeply exhales)

326
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:37,090
If the old quack is right, this is going to be a huge jackpot.

327
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:39,926
Right?

328
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:42,262
(deeply exhales)

329
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,764
A body that does not die

330
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,475
would be a living bundle of money.

331
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:53,481
Exactly, right? And that old quack had to lose him. So annoying.

332
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,941
(clicks tongue)

333
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,571
MR. KIM (on radio): What was it called, "Connect"?

334
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,031
Wow.

I've heard it somewhere.

504
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:44,668
I definitely, definitely recognize this place.

505
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,962
(breathing heavily)

506
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,676
DONGSOO: W... when I would go around collecting things...

507
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,346
DETECTIVE YEOM: Detective Choi.

508
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:56,680
Huh?

509
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,098
Could you take a look at this?

510
00:41:58,182 --> 00:41:59,433
(sighs)

511
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:00,643
What is it?

512
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:04,313
There are people who are following that lunatic.

513
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,898
What?

514
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:07,733
Mm, American.

515
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,901
It's German.

516
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:11,028
Oh, German. What's it say?

517
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,447
The translation says,

518
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:16,200
"The perpetrator of this murder is the worst criminal,

519
00:42:16,283 --> 00:42:19,203
but their artistic sense does draw out my admiration."

520
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,621
(scoffs)

521
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,374
This is French.

522
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:25,543
Tell us what it says, boy, the damn translation.

523
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:28,754
"I wish the case would be resolved as soon as possible,

524
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:31,465
but it scares me how part of me is looking forward to the next piece."

525
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,801
I'M SCARED THAT HE'S A MURDERER, BUT I ACKNOWLEDGE HIS ART. TALENT IS BORN!

526
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,927
Vietnamese.

527
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,263
This is Mongolian.

528
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,348
(inhales deeply)

529
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:43,352
(sighs) Oh boy, they are all turning crazy.

530
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:55,948
(pained moan)

531
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:03,330
(breathing heavily)

532
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,002
(trembling voice) Ah, again.

533
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,422
(foreboding music)

534
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:26,895
DONGSOO: What is this?

535
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,567
(breathing shakily)

536
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,946
This is...

537
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,032
I SHALL PROVE IT. THE NEUROTICISM WHICH FREUD SPOKE OF,

538
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,326
THAT HAS CONFLICTS WITH EGO, ONCE GAVE ME TEDIOUS,

539
00:43:40,409 --> 00:43:42,786
TEETH-RATTLING FEAR, BUT IN FACT...

540
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,289
(breathing shakily)

541
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:50,002
CORPSE ART

542
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,087
SEARCH CORPSE ART

543
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,971
(startled breathing)

544
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,225
The person who took my eye...

545
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:10,230
(stammering) ...was a murderer?

546
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:13,817
(breathing shakily)

547
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,496
(indistinct chatter)

548
00:44:42,096 --> 00:44:45,140
It's here, it's here!

549
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,102
Find out everything about this guy.

550
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:52,106
Okay, so this guy is a strong suspect.

551
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,566
(breathes deeply) See?

552
00:44:55,526 --> 00:44:56,652
Really?

553
00:44:57,569 --> 00:44:58,987
(sighs lightly)

554
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,491
-Come on, you bastard. -(pained moan)

555
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,756
DONGSOO: He is here.

556
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,259
(foreboding music)

557
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,564
OCTOBER 14TH - FATHER JANUARY 21ST - 23RD

558
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,815
FEBRUARY 5TH - MOTHER SEPTEMBER 28TH - 30TH

559
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,904
DONGSOO: Give me back my eye, you murderer.

560
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,657
(closing theme music)
