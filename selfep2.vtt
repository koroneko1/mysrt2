Where did the cat "Meow" go? 

00:00:58.053 --> 00:01:00.963
I think Neo has slaughtered it already.

00:01:01.082 --> 00:01:03.250
Damn, he's a psycho.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.423
I guess you're the next one to be killed.

00:01:06.542 --> 00:01:08.539
What the fuck?? Take back what you said!!

00:01:09.422 --> 00:01:11.231
Fuck..the psycho's here.

00:01:22.587 --> 00:01:24.445
(Killer)

00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:27.294
Okay...you guys have already matched up , right?

00:01:27.723 --> 00:01:30.615
Today, we are going to talk about "Resultant force of an equilibrium.

00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:34.934
And at the end of the class, we will study "Circular motion" also.

00:01:35.602 --> 00:01:36.314
Hey, teacher

00:01:37.077 --> 00:01:38.298
I don't have a partner yet.

00:01:38.823 --> 00:01:40.919
Can we do a group of three?

00:01:41.158 --> 00:01:42.919
Me, Mark and Kla together.

00:01:43.162 --> 00:01:45.983
Why so complicated? Neo was sitting alone.

00:01:45.983 --> 00:01:47.221
Go pair up with Neo one.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.550
I don't want to, sir.

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:52.950
If I pair with him... I wouldn't know if I will lose one of my hand or not.

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.289
Hey, Mark! watch your mouth.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.730
Or maybe... he will probably hit my head with a meter ruler.

00:01:59.126 --> 00:02:01.416
Like P'Fei.. who has been killed by...

00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:05.285
Please! Don't kill me

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:06.047
Neo stop! /Neo.

00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:07.261
Do you want to die, huh?

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:08.674
I told you I didn't do it.

00:02:09.271 --> 00:02:10.842
Neo don't Neo...

00:02:16.463 --> 00:02:19.103
Between a promise and finding himself

00:02:29.347 --> 00:02:30.383
See you, Nam Mei

00:02:31.027 --> 00:02:31.834
Wait..

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:43.370
Mei.. can I ask you something?

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:47.081
Just a sec, let me brush your hair first before asking me something.

00:02:47.892 --> 00:02:48.842
Can you turn around?

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:52.574
What are you gonna ask me?

00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:56.005
Well... can you help me find someone?

00:02:57.178 --> 00:03:01.037
He's a student with "W.P." embroidery on his shirt.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.204
W.P.?

00:03:03.681 --> 00:03:06.000
Wiang Panya Lamphun High School?

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.097
Whoa!!! So.. your target is in the Lamphun now?

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:12.175
No.. it's man actually

00:03:12.604 --> 00:03:15.125
Hmm!! So you're up to a man??? 

00:03:15.126 --> 00:03:16.683
Slow down, That's not what I mean

00:03:16.683 --> 00:03:21.064
No, I understand you. It's okay, the world is wide open and I'm just shocked.

00:03:21.183 --> 00:03:23.407
So.. where did you find this guy?

00:03:26.253 --> 00:03:27.765
In the mirror..

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.672
Mirror again? what's now

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:33.938
You can't see your own reflection in the mirror. And see his instead?

00:03:33.938 --> 00:03:34.984
How do you know??

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.443
What the hell?

00:03:36.443 --> 00:03:40.806
I'm just kidding, are you crazy or something?

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.873
Whatever

00:03:42.183 --> 00:03:44.767
You want me to find his social media right? Well,

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.651
there's a trade off

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.920
What???

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.630
You have to promise me that you're going to apologize May this evening.

00:03:52.773 --> 00:03:54.324
And make it up

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:57.973
What does it have to do with me asking you to help me find someone?

00:03:59.023 --> 00:04:00.389
Then, do it yourself

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:05.061
I... will go apologize may, okay?

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:08.198
No...No, not "okay". 

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:10.387
You have to "promise" me you'll go apologize him.

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:12.000
Well, I promise

00:04:12.415 --> 00:04:15.192
Yay!! Detective "Nam-mei" is on the mission.

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:17.363
Is it a man or a woman??

00:04:17.363 --> 00:04:22.124
Man.. / Man? Randomly..

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:25.413
This person? / No / Isn't him?

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.988
This person? / I told you it's a man...

00:04:30.283 --> 00:04:32.505
Sorry..

00:04:33.507 --> 00:04:37.940
Is this person? / No / This is so tough...

00:04:39.202 --> 00:04:40.631
Is it this person?

00:04:41.872 --> 00:04:43.797
Hey!! Yes, yes!

00:04:44.362 --> 00:04:46.483
this is that guy... you're so good at this

00:04:47.151 --> 00:04:48.797
Yeah.. and don't forget what you promise okay?

00:04:49.322 --> 00:04:52.745
Yeah.. / yeah yeah yeah

00:04:57.953 --> 00:05:03.115
(heard from my friends in Lamphun that there's a student got push from the abandoned building. The guy who pushed him still out there! what is wrong with the world!!)

00:05:05.637 --> 00:05:09.337
I will kill you, bastards

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:15.194
(Isn't that from Wiang Panya Lamphun???)

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:17.604
(Hey! it's about Neo and Fei!!) 

00:05:18.368 --> 00:05:21.680
(The police said that there is no evidence that Neo push Fei, wasn't that so?)

00:05:22.078 --> 00:05:25.178
(Why he's still out there?? The school should punish him or something!)

00:05:30.043 --> 00:05:32.231
Do you have family issue?

00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:34.756
Why didn't your parents come?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.927
Apart from that high school senior, are there any other problems?

00:05:42.401 --> 00:05:43.880
Neo, do you know that you're wrong?

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.766
no matter what your friends say, but you shouldn't act in a violent manner.

00:05:51.687 --> 00:05:54.267
During the time you got suspended.... go clean yourself.

00:05:55.914 --> 00:05:58.380
About Mark, I will compromise his parents.

00:05:59.382 --> 00:06:00.857
But that's all I can help.

00:06:33.136 --> 00:06:34.120
Hey.. man.

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:35.690
Yes?

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.050
Do you know someone named "Neo"??

00:06:39.102 --> 00:06:40.562
Why are you looking for Neo?

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:41.799
Oh well...

00:06:42.781 --> 00:06:44.662
I'm a school reporter from Chiang Mai.

00:06:47.334 --> 00:06:48.690
Are you a reporter?

00:06:49.743 --> 00:06:52.100
That thing about Neo killed a senior in school?

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:53.977
Hmm...

00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:56.553
but I got the rumors that Neo didn't do it?

00:06:57.412 --> 00:06:59.865
Bro! the school's just covering it up.

00:07:00.943 --> 00:07:04.829
This guy didn't just kill seniors in school. He also picked on his classmate and had a fight.

00:07:04.948 --> 00:07:06.958
Now he has been suspended from school.

00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:14.123
Are you really a reporter? Seems like you barely know anything

00:07:14.243 --> 00:07:17.748
Of course! Umm.. I'm a trainee reporter.

00:07:18.573 --> 00:07:21.169
Hey, do you his address?

00:07:21.803 --> 00:07:23.340
I know, bro...

00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:28.250
But if I tell you, I don't know how you gonna write about this.

00:07:32.664 --> 00:07:33.781
100 Baht, deal?

00:07:34.003 --> 00:07:37.325
Come on!! I don't want it

00:07:37.587 --> 00:07:42.534
How can I be sure that you're not gonna destroy my school's reputation?

00:07:43.059 --> 00:07:46.163
Dude, just tell the me the truth if you didn't know.

00:07:46.289 --> 00:07:47.883
I don't have time for this.

00:07:50.075 --> 00:07:51.264
Bro!!

00:07:52.063 --> 00:07:56.479
I can tell you... he lives in Kittitat dorm.

00:07:59.467 --> 00:08:03.759
2nd floor, near the stairs, room 201

00:08:04.690 --> 00:08:06.674
It's a bit shabby.

00:08:07.123 --> 00:08:10.582
Why did you know so thoroughly? Are you teasing me?

00:08:11.512 --> 00:08:12.582
I'm really telling you the truth!

00:08:13.683 --> 00:08:14.652
Well, I used to be close to him.

00:08:16.083 --> 00:08:19.549
But since that happened.. I started to get away from him.

00:08:21.648 --> 00:08:24.698
Ok, brother. Thank you very much. See you around

00:09:09.438 --> 00:09:10.916
Hello..

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:15.123
Tang, where are you? I'm waiting here at the coffee shop next to the school.

00:09:15.123 --> 00:09:17.610
Well, I saw you didn't answer LINE so I call

00:09:20.473 --> 00:09:21.299
(Mom)

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:27.998
(Mark)

00:09:39.974 --> 00:09:41.220
Where you think you going?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.120
What are you guys doing?

00:09:43.438 --> 00:09:44.555
Where are you going?

00:09:44.892 --> 00:09:46.020
What did you do to me?

00:09:46.664 --> 00:09:47.618
What did you do???

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.859
Uh, I'll be there in a moment... Uh, uh, okay

00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.291
You bastards!

00:10:01.297 --> 00:10:02.898
You see this? wanna die so bad, huh?

00:10:03.661 --> 00:10:04.161
Don't!!!!!!

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.981
Maybe half an hour, just a moment..

00:10:10.911 --> 00:10:12.169
No!!!!

00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:16.367
You went too far this time!!. / Why did you do that??

00:10:18.538 --> 00:10:19.209
Let's go

00:10:22.525 --> 00:10:24.599
See you soon. / Ok,

00:10:26.159 --> 00:10:26.710
(Nam-Mei)

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:55.316
Excuse me, we will close in five minutes.

00:10:56.258 --> 00:10:57.653
Oh okay.

00:10:58.607 --> 00:11:00.822
Nam-Mei, I don't think Tang will be here.

00:11:02.146 --> 00:11:03.246
...I understand you

00:11:03.648 --> 00:11:05.171
I know you give it all to him

00:11:05.675 --> 00:11:07.347
but If there's nothing coming back...

00:11:07.973 --> 00:11:09.257
I think that's enough.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:12.950
Are you leaving now?

00:11:13.256 --> 00:11:16.412
What's the point to wait for him? The shop is gonna close now.

00:11:19.126 --> 00:11:20.859
If you gonna wait, just wait. I'll leave now.

00:12:17.859 --> 00:12:19.125
Tang : Hey, my battery was dead so I couldn't answer your phone.

00:12:19.125 --> 00:12:20.328
Nam-mei : You okay right?

00:12:20.456 --> 00:12:22.549
Tang : Yeah, I went to see you guys but the shop has already closed.

00:12:27.173 --> 00:12:28.939
(May left the chat group)

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:36.292
He lives in Kittitat dorm. 2nd floor, near the stairs, room 201. It's a bit shabby.

00:14:01.538 --> 00:14:04.680
June : Hey, it's me "June" we met this evening :P. 
This is the clip of Neo hitting his friend.

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.605
June : pls, don't tell him I text u.. it's a bit scary.

00:15:25.633 --> 00:15:26.679
Who are you? 

00:15:31.026 --> 00:15:32.999
I asked who are you??

00:15:36.456 --> 00:15:38.763
What are you doing in my room???

00:15:49.344 --> 00:15:53.315
attitude clinic attitude

00:15:59.313 --> 00:16:00.963
So.. you gonna use this gun for what?

00:16:00.963 --> 00:16:02.438
I just have it for my protection.   

00:16:02.438 --> 00:16:03.663
If you want it back..

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:05.530
then, come meet me at Chiang Mai.

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.680
Hey guys.. I'm so sorry that I break your promise..

00:16:13.728 --> 00:16:14.778

00:16:14.778 --> 00:16:15.728
(I will go see you there)
