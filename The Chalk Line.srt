NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:54,875
SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT

3
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:10,958
You okay?

4
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,125
Sort of.

5
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,833
You can tell me.

6
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,458
ALARM

7
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,958
Hey, Paula, be careful,
looks like something's there.

8
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,250
All right, let's go.

9
00:02:58,333 --> 00:02:59,167
Simón.

10
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,333
Simón!

11
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:17,417
Hello.

12
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,583
You okay?

13
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:39,333
No.

14
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,792
-Wait, wait, wait!
-Hey, wait, hey!

15
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,958
Look out!

16
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:48,833
Slow down! Stop! Stop!

17
00:03:48,917 --> 00:03:50,792
-Move, move, move!
-Stop, stop!

18
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,083
-You hurt?
-No.

19
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:58,625
Are you all right?

20
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:10,208
-I'll call an ambulance.
-There's no time.

21
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:18,667
It's serious.

22
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,708
-I should've called an ambulance.
-Quite the contrary.

23
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:23,583
Your quick action saved her.

24
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,667
It looked like the motorcycle
didn't even hit her.

25
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,250
That's not the problem.

26
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,625
She was already very sick.

27
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,792
What's wrong with her?

28
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,250
We're running tests.

29
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,625
-And her parents?
-We're trying to find them.

30
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:40,250
But there are
no missing girls in the area.

31
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,792
When you found her, did she say anything?

32
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:46,042
Did she speak?

33
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,875
-She didn't.
-No, nothing.

34
00:06:55,292 --> 00:06:58,292
If she's not talking,
how did you find out her name?

35
00:06:58,375 --> 00:07:00,292
One of the nurses is named Clara,

36
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:03,125
and she reacted very strongly to the name.

37
00:07:03,208 --> 00:07:04,917
-Anything else?
-Nothing.

38
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,292
-How come?
-We're not sure.

39
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,708
Mutism is very broad.
There are many things that can cause it.

40
00:07:10,792 --> 00:07:13,875
Well, how did she get so sick?
I mean, do you have any idea?

41
00:07:13,958 --> 00:07:15,792
There are lots of unanswered questions.

42
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,042
The main thing is that the doctors

43
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:21,042
are saying she's handling
the treatment extremely well.

44
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:24,333
And soon we'll be able
to say she's a normal healthy girl.

45
00:07:28,792 --> 00:07:30,167
Hey, what's wrong?

46
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:35,625
What happened?
Did something happen with one of the kids?

47
00:07:42,708 --> 00:07:44,042
Hey, hey!

48
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:50,583
Okay, okay. Calm down.

49
00:08:06,917 --> 00:08:10,208
Do you want us to stay?

50
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:15,708
Clara?

51
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,125
Is your name Clara?

52
00:08:19,792 --> 00:08:21,000
I'll stay with her here.

53
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:20,917
How do they know her age?

54
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,500
They did an X-ray on one of her hands.

55
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,042
-And her parents?
-They can't find them.

56
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,542
-Did they say more?
-No.

57
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:34,250
They don't know much.
So they can't tell us much.

58
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,750
Oh my God, that poor girl.

59
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:38,958
It's awful.

60
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,917
Was she abused at all?

61
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,125
No.

62
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,500
Is she staying at the hospital?

63
00:09:48,167 --> 00:09:50,167
Mm. She's very sick.

64
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,250
Her kidneys barely work.

65
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,417
They don't know
if it's genetic or--

66
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,417
Terrible.

67
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,875
That's why
they need to find her parents.

68
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,375
They should cut their balls off.

69
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,917
Leave it there.

70
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:41,958
Excuse me.
Is she not feeling well?

71
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:43,958
We have her sedated right now.

72
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,333
Why is she tied up?

73
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,167
It's for safety.

74
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:21,583
Simón.

75
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,208
Can't untie this girl.

76
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,208
-Clara.
-I'm sorry.

77
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:33,458
You can't be here. Excuse us.

78
00:11:40,792 --> 00:11:43,000
NO ONE CLAIMS GIRL FROM THE ROAD

79
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:45,875
POLICE STILL INVESTIGATING
WHERE SHE CAME FROM TWO WEEKS LATER

80
00:11:54,917 --> 00:11:57,625
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

81
00:12:01,917 --> 00:12:04,250
Paula, I'll be late.

82
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:08,875
I'm coming!

83
00:12:13,458 --> 00:12:15,458
Shall I pick you up to see Clara?

84
00:12:17,708 --> 00:12:18,542
Huh?

85
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:22,208
Simón, should I get you?

86
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:26,167
Yes.

87
00:12:56,292 --> 00:12:58,292
Weren't you in a hurry?

88
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,417
Want some?

89
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:04,750
Thank you.

90
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:13,417
What?

91
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:16,875
I can't stop thinking about her.

92
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,250
Her kidneys
are finally responding,

93
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:25,333
and thanks to you, she's improved a lot.

94
00:13:25,417 --> 00:13:27,500
And her parents? Any news?

95
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:29,958
We can't find anything.

96
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:34,500
Think of the chalk square like this table.

97
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:37,167
Inside, everything is fine.

98
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,917
But if we force her to come out…

99
00:13:41,625 --> 00:13:43,250
for Clara,
it's like falling into the void.

100
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,958
In the hospital, she's not doing well.

101
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,833
In order to help her,
we need to establish some connection

102
00:13:50,917 --> 00:13:51,917
so she feels safe.

103
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,083
It's a huge responsibility, but she has
started to form a bond with you,

104
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:59,792
and we wanna take advantage
of that to help her find her family.

105
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:03,875
This isn't like fostering.
It's more complicated than that.

106
00:14:03,958 --> 00:14:07,083
When parents foster, there's usually
a learning period. We don't have time.

107
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:11,042
She is our priority, especially since
we don't know where she comes from.

108
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,167
-And she doesn't have a home.
-We understand.

109
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,750
I've been completely honest with you.

110
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:18,708
I've explained everything.
So it's up to you.

111
00:14:18,792 --> 00:14:21,958
Think it through and if you agree,
we'll start on the paperwork.

112
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:27,583
Hey, uh, Paula,
did the doctors approve this?

113
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,500
Yes.

114
00:14:29,542 --> 00:14:32,458
Well, I think that little girl
should be in a hospital,

115
00:14:32,542 --> 00:14:34,375
cared for by professionals.

116
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,292
Yeah, but she's not doing well there,
and this was a good option.

117
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:39,792
We'll see how it goes
for a few days and go from there.

118
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,667
Have you thought this through?

119
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,875
Yes, we both discussed it.

120
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:47,750
So it's decided, yeah?

121
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:49,958
She'll get here tonight.

122
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:52,500
Tonight? Well,
we should leave you to get set up, then.

123
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:57,292
Simón.

124
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:00,208
Simón.

125
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,042
She saw the chalk square.

126
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,208
Good morning, Clara.

127
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:27,208
Want some?

128
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,917
-You want some?
-Yes.

129
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,250
-Mmm!
-Is it good?

130
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:40,542
Mmm! Really good.

131
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,250
Mmm. Delicious.

132
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,333
Yogurt is a good choice.

133
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,792
-Mm. Yeah.
-It's always good.

134
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:55,833
Good night.

135
00:21:24,333 --> 00:21:26,875
Clara, you wanna come with me?

136
00:21:48,917 --> 00:21:50,333
It's in all her drawings.

137
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:52,750
She's probably
done it her whole life.

138
00:22:02,792 --> 00:22:05,083
Clara, will you come and play outside?

139
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:07,542
You want to?

140
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,042
Clara, I'll erase it.

141
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,792
Gloria, don't.

142
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:16,833
Wait in the kitchen.

143
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:19,750
-Don't do that.
-We have to try it.

144
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:22,000
Come on.

145
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,917
Look at me. At me.

146
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:29,292
I'll count to three,
and then we'll erase the chalk line.

147
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:31,125
One.

148
00:22:32,458 --> 00:22:33,292
Two.

149
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:37,000
Don't be afraid.

150
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:39,417
And… and three.

151
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,000
Are you hurt?

152
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,417
Come on, wait. Let her do her job.

153
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,500
Breathe.

154
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:56,958
Clara!

155
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,958
-Buma! Buma!
-Stop it!

156
00:23:07,125 --> 00:23:08,458
Shh!

157
00:23:23,542 --> 00:23:26,417
Clara, I know you understand.

158
00:23:27,417 --> 00:23:29,083
I know you can speak.

159
00:23:30,458 --> 00:23:32,333
Earlier you said "buma."

160
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,417
What is "buma"?

161
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,583
No, I can't talk.

162
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,792
No, I can't talk.

163
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:55,708
Please.

164
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,417
What is that? I can't hear you.

165
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,833
Where is your house?

166
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:10,750
House. Kreide.

167
00:24:10,833 --> 00:24:13,208
"Kreide?" What is "kreide"?

168
00:24:14,542 --> 00:24:16,458
-Kreide.
-Kreide.

169
00:24:17,042 --> 00:24:19,375
Where's your home? Is it near here?

170
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,667
Is it far away?

171
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,792
Who do you live with?

172
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,083
Mama.

173
00:24:31,792 --> 00:24:33,667
You live with your mama.

174
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,708
Mama.

175
00:24:34,792 --> 00:24:37,708
Anyone else? Do you live with your papa?

176
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:41,917
Clara, who do you live with?

177
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:47,208
If you don't wanna talk to me,
I'll have to erase the chalk.

178
00:24:47,917 --> 00:24:49,833
Clara!

179
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:10,958
Hello.

180
00:25:15,333 --> 00:25:17,292
I won't force you to speak to me.

181
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:20,500
I know you're afraid
of crossing the chalk,

182
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
but…

183
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,958
you don't have to force yourself.

184
00:25:26,792 --> 00:25:28,750
Clara, while you're living here,

185
00:25:28,833 --> 00:25:31,667
Simón and I will make sure
nothing bad happens to you.

186
00:25:33,292 --> 00:25:34,292
I promise.

187
00:25:37,167 --> 00:25:38,667
We'll stay here.

188
00:25:59,042 --> 00:26:00,625
What's this?

189
00:26:03,125 --> 00:26:03,958
Is it for me?

190
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,625
It's beautiful.

191
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:21,000
I love your gift.

192
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,542
-Hey, you brought lots of things--
-Don't step on the chalk line.

193
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:27,500
We thought she couldn't talk.

194
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:30,333
-Yeah, we thought that too.
-It's been a surprise to everyone.

195
00:26:30,417 --> 00:26:31,583
What does she say?

196
00:26:31,667 --> 00:26:34,125
It's random words.
Nothing understandable.

197
00:26:34,208 --> 00:26:36,333
The psychologist thinks
she'll start talking a little.

198
00:26:36,417 --> 00:26:39,000
She said "mama."
She probably lived with her.

199
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:41,417
-And her dad?
-Nothing about him.

200
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,708
You gonna teach her to speak?

201
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,208
We're wondering if it's just
a matter of her gaining confidence.

202
00:26:46,292 --> 00:26:47,125
You need a glass.

203
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,083
-Oh, yes.
-No, no, no. I'll go. I'll go.

204
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:53,042
Thank you.

205
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:56,875
Sorry, I don't know what I'm doing.

206
00:26:56,958 --> 00:26:58,583
It does sound like you're making progress.

207
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:00,917
-Hmm.
-Thanks to Paula.

208
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,833
The girl adores her.

209
00:27:01,917 --> 00:27:04,500
Ainhoa is dying to meet Clara.

210
00:27:04,583 --> 00:27:05,417
Yeah?

211
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,458
It might be good for her.
To play with some other kids.

212
00:27:08,542 --> 00:27:11,917
We can come over tomorrow morning
and have breakfast together.

213
00:27:12,917 --> 00:27:13,750
Okay.

214
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:31,125
That might've been
a little too intense, honey.

215
00:27:31,625 --> 00:27:33,000
Go on, go play with her.

216
00:27:36,208 --> 00:27:38,250
It's good we came over before her game.

217
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,958
-I can't believe how big she is.
-Neither can I.

218
00:27:49,625 --> 00:27:50,792
You're looking better.

219
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,083
I'm happy for you, Paula.

220
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:01,167
-Do you want some more toast?
-No, I think I might explode.

221
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,875
Girls!

222
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:09,125
Come have breakfast.

223
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:13,375
Girls.

224
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:21,125
What's wrong?

225
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:57,792
How is she?

226
00:28:57,875 --> 00:29:00,208
Fine, I just helped her back home.

227
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:01,250
Come here.

228
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,167
Look at what I found.

229
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,667
These were in the jam.

230
00:29:14,792 --> 00:29:16,750
Plus the one Claudia had in her mouth.

231
00:29:17,417 --> 00:29:18,458
Look at the jar there.

232
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:25,417
-But it looks normal.
-Exactly.

233
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,875
-Simón--
-Someone put the glass in it.

234
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:29,375
Oh, yeah?

235
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,125
No.

236
00:29:40,208 --> 00:29:43,125
Do you not understand
what's going on here?

237
00:29:43,208 --> 00:29:45,708
That there was a piece
of broken glass in the jar?

238
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,167
Come on.

239
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:54,500
Should we call Gloria
and tell her about this?

240
00:29:54,583 --> 00:29:56,500
Mm, no, we can tell her tomorrow.

241
00:30:00,292 --> 00:30:01,417
What a mess.

242
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:07,750
I'll be back.

243
00:30:11,917 --> 00:30:13,750
Remember to buy some more chalk for us.

244
00:31:06,375 --> 00:31:07,292
What's wrong?

245
00:31:10,708 --> 00:31:11,542
Look.

246
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:17,083
"Kreide?"
What is "kreide"?

247
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:21,125
-Please.
-Shh.

248
00:31:21,208 --> 00:31:24,292
What is that? I can't hear you

249
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:26,583
Please.

250
00:31:26,667 --> 00:31:28,583
Shh.

251
00:31:28,667 --> 00:31:29,500
SPANISH - GERMAN

252
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:33,958
DID YOU MEAN: BESTRAFEN

253
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:35,708
PUNISHMENT

254
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:48,083
Where's your home?
Is it near here? Is it far away?

255
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,000
FEAR

256
00:31:57,292 --> 00:31:58,417
And "buma"?

257
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:09,458
NO MATCHES FOR: BUMA

258
00:32:09,542 --> 00:32:11,250
I'm going to tell the police.

259
00:32:11,333 --> 00:32:14,125
If Clara is German, I'm sure
they can help them find her parents.

260
00:32:14,208 --> 00:32:15,875
I'll call you as soon as I know something.

261
00:32:15,958 --> 00:32:17,042
Thank you.

262
00:32:26,083 --> 00:32:28,042
Why don't you wanna
tell her about the glass?

263
00:32:28,625 --> 00:32:30,250
I don't want her to misinterpret it.

264
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,875
'Cause I did?

265
00:32:53,833 --> 00:32:55,000
In my hand.

266
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,542
So you speak German.

267
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:08,292
Is your mama German? Or your papa?

268
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,417
Have you lived in Germany?

269
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,042
Hey, come on, talk to me, please.

270
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:24,250
I'll be right back.

271
00:34:13,083 --> 00:34:13,917
Clara.

272
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,083
Clara?

273
00:34:56,375 --> 00:34:57,208
Clara?

274
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:15,458
Clara.

275
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,125
María! Did you see a girl
come out of my house?

276
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,625
Blonde, about six years old? You seen her?

277
00:36:16,708 --> 00:36:17,917
Don't worry…

278
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:28,583
What are you doing? Drawing?

279
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,042
Do you want some water or juice?

280
00:36:48,208 --> 00:36:49,042
What's wrong?

281
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,708
Hey, the washing machine broke.

282
00:37:01,583 --> 00:37:03,000
Everything's fine!

283
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,333
Hey.

284
00:37:45,292 --> 00:37:46,542
Were you hiding from me?

285
00:37:47,042 --> 00:37:47,875
Hmm?

286
00:37:51,917 --> 00:37:53,542
What are you afraid of?

287
00:37:58,208 --> 00:37:59,042
Is it "buma"?

288
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:04,958
Is it something?

289
00:38:07,458 --> 00:38:09,292
Is-- Is it a person?

290
00:38:15,792 --> 00:38:17,042
Talk to me, Clara.

291
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:20,875
Is it a place?

292
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:30,792
What if we drew it?

293
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,667
Let's draw it together. Here you go.

294
00:38:43,125 --> 00:38:43,958
Okay.

295
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,500
We won't. It's okay.

296
00:38:48,125 --> 00:38:49,542
Can you please talk to me?

297
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:55,000
Clara.

298
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:59,583
Clara, what do you prefer,
talking or erasing the chalk?

299
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,542
You know how to both of those things.

300
00:39:03,333 --> 00:39:05,625
I'll do it.

301
00:39:06,542 --> 00:39:09,292
Hey!

302
00:39:09,375 --> 00:39:10,458
Listen to me, hey!

303
00:39:11,792 --> 00:39:13,417
Clara, I won't erase it!

304
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,417
I'm sorry.

305
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:44,292
Did Clara hit you?

306
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,083
-No.
-She didn't attack you?

307
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:53,292
Well, I tried to force her to talk to me,
but I couldn't.

308
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:58,083
And the glass? A pregnant
woman ended up in the hospital.

309
00:39:58,167 --> 00:40:00,000
We were gonna tell you tomorrow.

310
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:03,000
Yes, it was a real shock.

311
00:40:04,375 --> 00:40:08,542
She understands when I speak German,
but she won't say anything.

312
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,167
Clara, why won't you talk anymore?

313
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:17,333
Has something made you angry?
Or maybe you're sad?

314
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,083
She's done
this lovely drawing.

315
00:40:21,833 --> 00:40:22,708
Can I see it?

316
00:40:24,625 --> 00:40:26,833
I think
she drew it for Paula.

317
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:28,708
Can I take a look?

318
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:33,542
Is that your house?

319
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,583
That's grass. Do you live in the country?

320
00:40:39,208 --> 00:40:40,958
That's the sky, isn't it?

321
00:40:42,542 --> 00:40:43,583
Why is it green?

322
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:45,375
Hmm?

323
00:40:53,958 --> 00:40:55,667
I don't know, honey, why don't you--

324
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:06,417
-We'll talk in a couple of days.
-We're doing fine, really.

325
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,208
She's starting to trust me.

326
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:10,083
This isn't working out. I'm sorry.

327
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,375
Oh, please, no.

328
00:41:12,458 --> 00:41:15,500
It's not your fault.
We'll get the paperwork started.

329
00:41:20,833 --> 00:41:23,500
When were you gonna tell me Clara hit you?

330
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:26,333
No, Simón, she didn't hit me.
She's six years old.

331
00:41:26,833 --> 00:41:28,542
-You're leaving?
-I'll be back.

332
00:41:28,625 --> 00:41:31,708
-Paula, we're talking right now. Paula!
-Just watch Clara please.

333
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:36,125
Watch your step.

334
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:41,167
You told everyone about it.
Now they're taking her away.

335
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,958
-Yes, because it was--
-Mind your own fucking business.

336
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,208
Are you coming to bed?

337
00:42:08,167 --> 00:42:09,708
Yes, I'll be right there.

338
00:42:39,542 --> 00:42:41,208
TRANSLATE: VUMA

339
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:45,083
Clara… I know you understand.

340
00:42:45,917 --> 00:42:47,417
I know you can speak.

341
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,125
-I'm going.
-Ciao.

342
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,875
Earlier you said "buma."

343
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,458
What is "buma"?

344
00:42:57,208 --> 00:42:58,958
No, I can't talk.

345
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:01,042
Shh.

346
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:04,750
No, I can't talk.

347
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,833
What is that? I can't hear you.

348
00:43:14,250 --> 00:43:15,750
Where is your house?

349
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:18,417
House. Kreide.

350
00:43:18,917 --> 00:43:20,958
"Kreide?" What is "kreide"?

351
00:43:22,250 --> 00:43:23,750
-Kreide.
-Kreide.

352
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:29,083
Where's your home?
Is it near here? Is it far away?

353
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:32,875
Who do you live with?

354
00:43:37,958 --> 00:43:40,250
-You live with your mama.
-Mama.

355
00:43:41,917 --> 00:43:44,542
Anyone else?

356
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:46,542
Do you live with your papa?

357
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:47,542
BU MAN

358
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,583
Clara, who do you live with?

359
00:43:57,917 --> 00:43:59,542
BOOGEYMAN

360
00:44:15,042 --> 00:44:18,500
If you don't wanna talk to me,
I'll have to erase the chalk.

361
00:44:20,583 --> 00:44:23,250
Clara!

362
00:45:54,667 --> 00:45:57,917
Clara!

363
00:46:16,458 --> 00:46:18,250
They found her jacket.

364
00:46:23,917 --> 00:46:24,750
Where was it?

365
00:46:25,333 --> 00:46:26,417
In the swamp.

366
00:46:28,167 --> 00:46:29,875
The divers are looking.

367
00:46:31,292 --> 00:46:34,208
-What happened after?
-She-- she was holding me.

368
00:46:35,917 --> 00:46:38,042
And I locked her in to go to the bathroom.

369
00:46:38,542 --> 00:46:41,375
-You locked her in?
-Yes, I mean, with the chalk.

370
00:46:41,458 --> 00:46:43,167
How long were you in the bathroom?

371
00:46:43,750 --> 00:46:45,167
Less than five minutes.

372
00:46:45,875 --> 00:46:48,000
When I came back…

373
00:46:48,083 --> 00:46:49,625
…the door was open and--

374
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,667
And Clara wasn't there.

375
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:53,583
Were you alone in the house?

376
00:46:53,667 --> 00:46:55,458
Yes, I was at work.

377
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:58,708
Wasn't there a previous incident
with the glass?

378
00:46:59,292 --> 00:47:00,500
Yes, it didn't feel important.

379
00:47:01,542 --> 00:47:03,000
Your neighbor went to the ER.

380
00:47:03,083 --> 00:47:05,500
These kinds of accidents
should be reported.

381
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:08,875
I was aware of it,
and deciding how to deal with it.

382
00:47:08,958 --> 00:47:10,917
I believe the girl ran away on her own.

383
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,083
No, that's impossible.

384
00:47:12,167 --> 00:47:15,083
-Because the girl won't cross the chalk?
-Exactly.

385
00:47:15,167 --> 00:47:18,625
But we've been informed that
this isn't the first time she disappeared,

386
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:20,833
and you ran outside
to go and look for her.

387
00:47:22,333 --> 00:47:24,125
No,
I don't think she went outside.

388
00:47:24,208 --> 00:47:27,500
I think that… she was hiding.

389
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:29,792
Yeah, you dealt with that as well?

390
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:36,792
Look, I've spent a lot of time with Clara,
and I know she was good with us.

391
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:40,542
So while you're looking in that swamp,

392
00:47:41,375 --> 00:47:42,625
I ask you,

393
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:46,000
don't exclude any other options.

394
00:47:49,875 --> 00:47:50,750
All right.

395
00:47:53,083 --> 00:47:55,417
Don't move from here. She might come back.

396
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,667
-You need to talk to Paula.
-Yeah, I know.

397
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,042
I've never seen her like this.

398
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:26,708
The most important thing is
for her to get back to normal.

399
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:30,208
-Do you think someone took the girl?
-No. Well, I don't know.

400
00:48:30,292 --> 00:48:32,167
I hope she's not in that swamp.

401
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:34,458
Don't say that. Paula.

402
00:48:36,125 --> 00:48:37,125
How are you?

403
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,042
Fine. Is there any news?

404
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,417
You only slept for two hours.

405
00:48:48,917 --> 00:48:50,375
You had time to clean.

406
00:48:53,792 --> 00:48:54,958
Are you okay?

407
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:56,750
Come back to the office.

408
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,625
If you don't,
they'll take your projects away.

409
00:48:59,292 --> 00:49:02,833
It's always nice
to get back to normal, Paula.

410
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:09,250
Well, do you know
they're moving my due date up?

411
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,875
Really?

412
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:14,958
-It'll be born on the same day as Beltrán.
-They told us on the way here.

413
00:49:15,917 --> 00:49:17,375
What a coincidence.

414
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:32,417
What?

415
00:49:34,042 --> 00:49:36,625
I don't know, Paula.
What do you think?

416
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:39,875
What do I think?

417
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:46,917
I'm really happy for you, Beltrán.

418
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,917
-Paula, they're just cheering you up.
-Just shut up.

419
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,458
-Paula, relax.
-Hey!

420
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:55,750
-Can you get out of my house, please?
-Paula.

421
00:49:55,833 --> 00:49:56,750
Can you all go?

422
00:49:58,333 --> 00:50:00,125
I'll see you out.

423
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,250
I'm sorry.

424
00:50:19,917 --> 00:50:21,500
Simón, I'm so nervous.

425
00:50:23,292 --> 00:50:25,333
-Where is she?
-I don't know.

426
00:50:27,333 --> 00:50:30,750
Well, I can't sit around waiting.

427
00:50:30,833 --> 00:50:32,167
Can you stay here, please?

428
00:50:32,667 --> 00:50:35,167
I don't want
her back in our house.

429
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:37,333
-What?
-She wasn't doing well.

430
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:42,125
Yes, you said that.

431
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:46,208
It's one thing for the others to say it,
but you?

432
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:49,292
-You think Clara opened the door and ran?
-You've been injecting yourself.

433
00:50:50,042 --> 00:50:52,625
-What?
-How many cycles have you done?

434
00:50:53,125 --> 00:50:54,333
You went to the clinic alone.

435
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:59,292
I thought we were planning
on being parents together.

436
00:51:00,417 --> 00:51:01,875
Were you gonna tell me?

437
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:03,458
I didn't go to the clinic.

438
00:51:03,542 --> 00:51:06,625
The shots were in the bathroom.
Hidden, but they were there.

439
00:51:07,875 --> 00:51:10,625
It's what I had left over from before.

440
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,208
So just one cycle?

441
00:51:12,875 --> 00:51:14,500
-I wanted to do one.
-How many?

442
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:17,833
I wanted to do one, but it didn't work.

443
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:20,917
-And I thought I could do another one.
-So you won't answer.

444
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:41,333
Okay, hang on, Simón.

445
00:51:41,958 --> 00:51:45,542
You're right. I should have told you
I did, but I didn't want you to worry.

446
00:51:45,625 --> 00:51:47,875
-How could you do that?
-I couldn't take it.

447
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:51,542
But we talked about it. We agreed
that we would take a break for a year.

448
00:51:51,625 --> 00:51:54,583
I'm sorry, I couldn't.

449
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:57,583
We've gone through six years
of treatments and doctors.

450
00:51:58,542 --> 00:52:00,625
Don't you remember how it was for us?

451
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:04,042
Yes, we were tired.

452
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:06,458
No, we were bad.

453
00:52:12,958 --> 00:52:15,417
All right, so,

454
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:18,958
you think you're on your own with this?

455
00:52:19,042 --> 00:52:20,667
No, I've never thought that.

456
00:52:21,333 --> 00:52:23,542
You just said a moment ago
you didn't wanna worry me.

457
00:52:23,625 --> 00:52:25,167
It's not about that.

458
00:52:27,625 --> 00:52:30,500
I wish I could have done more.

459
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:32,333
Taken on more.

460
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,792
This is for us, my love, I promise.

461
00:52:39,083 --> 00:52:40,583
All right then, so?

462
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:43,500
I wanted to sit you down and tell you.

463
00:52:45,083 --> 00:52:46,875
"Hey, guess what, we're pregnant."

464
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:49,083
No.

465
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,417
Yes, it's as simple
and as difficult as that.

466
00:52:52,708 --> 00:52:55,750
But you decided all on your own.

467
00:52:55,833 --> 00:52:59,333
-I felt strong enough, Simón.
-How can you be strong enough if I'm not?

468
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:00,417
We're different.

469
00:53:01,417 --> 00:53:02,250
Yes.

470
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:05,250
Yes, you took
that thing you said was ours,

471
00:53:05,833 --> 00:53:07,833
and you made it yours alone.

472
00:53:09,792 --> 00:53:11,583
It's the same with the girl.

473
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:15,833
What? I'm confused.
This has nothing to do with Clara.

474
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:19,500
You didn't include me, Paula.
You became obsessed.

475
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,500
-Locked yourself up.
-I don't see it like that.

476
00:53:21,583 --> 00:53:22,500
-You don't?
-No.

477
00:53:22,583 --> 00:53:24,458
We've been sleeping apart for weeks.

478
00:53:24,542 --> 00:53:26,792
You've been hiding things
and attack people who disagree.

479
00:53:26,875 --> 00:53:29,125
-I'm not hiding anything.
-She hit you.

480
00:53:29,208 --> 00:53:31,458
No, she didn't hit me.
She's six years old, Simón.

481
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,292
-She ran away.
-She was hiding!

482
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:35,625
-You don't care what I say.
-I forced her to speak to me.

483
00:53:35,708 --> 00:53:37,583
You're always going to
have an explanation.

484
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:39,750
Do you know what my explanation
is right now?

485
00:53:39,833 --> 00:53:41,000
What?

486
00:53:41,083 --> 00:53:43,625
-That I devoted myself to that girl.
-I didn't?

487
00:53:43,708 --> 00:53:46,958
I accepted the responsibility
we had to that girl.

488
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:49,250
That's different from an obsession.

489
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:51,583
No, you insisted
on keeping that girl here in this house

490
00:53:51,667 --> 00:53:53,875
when they should have taken
her away weeks ago.

491
00:53:53,958 --> 00:53:57,083
-That's what's going on.
-That's your idea of being a father?

492
00:53:57,167 --> 00:54:00,625
I am not her father.

493
00:54:02,917 --> 00:54:04,292
I'm not her mother.

494
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:09,875
I don't understand why you
wanted to bring her home, then.

495
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,750
-The truth?
-Yes, please.

496
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,542
Because I thought it would
be good for us, good for you.

497
00:54:16,292 --> 00:54:17,833
But you're saying you were neglected?

498
00:54:24,083 --> 00:54:26,042
Can you explain this to me?

499
00:54:35,833 --> 00:54:37,042
Explain it.

500
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:40,833
Take a bath, eat something.

501
00:55:08,833 --> 00:55:09,708
Yes.

502
00:55:12,542 --> 00:55:13,375
Hello.

503
00:55:14,042 --> 00:55:14,875
Mama?

504
00:55:15,792 --> 00:55:16,750
Clara?

505
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:18,875
Clara, where are you?

506
00:55:19,375 --> 00:55:20,208
Mama.

507
00:55:21,208 --> 00:55:22,083
Are you okay?

508
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:24,750
Ho-- honey, what's wrong?

509
00:55:44,417 --> 00:55:46,500
Fine. All right. See ya.

510
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:49,333
You have any news?

511
00:55:49,417 --> 00:55:51,917
We're studying cases from all over Europe.

512
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,125
We're leaving no stone unturned.

513
00:56:05,208 --> 00:56:06,583
Have you traced the phone call?

514
00:56:07,292 --> 00:56:10,167
We know the number
from which the call was made.

515
00:56:14,542 --> 00:56:16,792
Have you had your phone stolen recently?

516
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:21,250
-No.
-Then it was you who made the call.

517
00:56:23,417 --> 00:56:24,333
Of course I didn't.

518
00:56:24,917 --> 00:56:26,500
Is that your number?

519
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,333
Yes, that's my cellphone number.

520
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:33,042
Simón, I know she called me.

521
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:36,417
Please, help me explain.
You were there too.

522
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:38,375
No, Paula, I had left.

523
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,625
They are going to give
you a psychological exam.

524
00:56:41,708 --> 00:56:43,875
I don't need a psychologist. No.

525
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:46,208
Then go ahead
and tell us everything you know.

526
00:56:46,917 --> 00:56:50,583
The worst thing that can happen
to that girl is to let more time go by.

527
00:56:50,667 --> 00:56:54,292
All right,
I explained this already.

528
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:57,875
I heard her perfectly calling me "Mama."

529
00:57:04,625 --> 00:57:05,875
Full name?

530
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:08,083
Paula Ejea Guzmán.

531
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,542
-Age?
-Forty-two years old.

532
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:19,167
You have to
leave your phone with us.

533
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:28,333
You can go now.

534
00:57:30,125 --> 00:57:32,500
Stay reachable in the area.

535
00:57:53,250 --> 00:57:54,333
Let's go home.

536
00:57:54,417 --> 00:57:56,167
I need to go for a walk.

537
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:58,833
-I'll go with you.
-I need time to think about this.

538
00:57:58,917 --> 00:58:00,708
Well, let's think together. Paula--

539
00:58:00,792 --> 00:58:03,250
We'll talk about it tonight. I promise.

I'm sorry, I don't understand you. Please.

01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:18,875
And Dr. Carrére, s'il vous plaît.

552
01:01:19,625 --> 01:01:23,458
Yes, the doctor is in,
uh, forensic, um, anatomy

553
01:01:23,542 --> 01:01:26,000
in another, uh, bigger town.

554
01:01:26,083 --> 01:01:26,917
Where?

555
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:29,708
If you're not a police officer,
she can't help you.

556
01:01:29,792 --> 01:01:30,958
Uh, she says she's sorry.

557
01:01:34,708 --> 01:01:37,042
S'il vous plaît, madame.
S'il vous plaît.

558
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,625
I need you to tell me everything
you know about this little girl.

559
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:44,458
She's very sorry.
She can't help you.

560
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:49,542
Are you a mother?

561
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,000
Please translate that.

562
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:00,625
Then you must help me.

563
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:03,625
S'il vous plaît.

564
01:02:14,708 --> 01:02:16,000
It was two years ago.

565
01:02:16,083 --> 01:02:20,875
She doesn't remember much more.

566
01:02:21,458 --> 01:02:25,417
The organs were very damaged.
Her kidneys were no longer functioning.

567
01:02:28,375 --> 01:02:30,875
Various marks
from repeated injuries to the neck.

568
01:02:30,958 --> 01:02:33,792
She suffered greatly.

569
01:02:38,625 --> 01:02:39,833
These two letters here.

570
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:43,083
Can you tell me what they mean?

571
01:02:45,125 --> 01:02:48,167
Amblyopie fonctionnelle.
I'm not sure how to translate it.

572
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:49,083
What is it?

573
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:53,167
A lazy eye.

574
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:26,583
NO NEW LEADS IN CASE OF GIRL
WHO WENT MISSING FROM A BEACH IN MÁLAGA

575
01:03:28,542 --> 01:03:31,417
A YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE THE DISAPPEARANCE

576
01:03:31,500 --> 01:03:33,625
OF THE SWISS GIRL IN PEDRALEJO BEACH

577
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:35,583
12 YEARS OLD

578
01:03:40,167 --> 01:03:41,750
SHE'S OUR ONLY CHILD

579
01:03:41,833 --> 01:03:44,167
I BEG YOU

580
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,167
CIVIL GUARD HASN'T REVEALED WHETHER
THE PARENTS ARE SUSPECTS OF CHILD ABUSE

581
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:56,375
It happened on a beach in Málaga
on the fifth of June in 2011.

582
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:59,167
Ingrid Morand disappeared without a trace.

583
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:02,375
A year later, her parents haven't
given up hope of finding her.

584
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:07,625
She's very kind-hearted
and has a great imagination.

585
01:04:09,708 --> 01:04:12,167
I'm sure she really misses her bedroom.

586
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:15,333
So please, bring our Ingrid back.

587
01:04:15,417 --> 01:04:17,042
She's our only daughter.

588
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:21,958
She's always making little crafts
that she gives to us and her friends.

589
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:25,750
She says they are guardian angels

590
01:04:25,833 --> 01:04:27,583
and that they protect us from bad things.

591
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:31,875
…guardian angels and that
they protect us from bad things.

592
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:41,458
Simón.

593
01:04:48,083 --> 01:04:48,917
Simón.

594
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,917
I'M AT THE POLICE STATION. CALL ME

595
01:06:39,292 --> 01:06:41,958
-Emergency.
-My name is Paula Ejea.

596
01:06:42,042 --> 01:06:44,417
My neighbor Eduardo Olivares
may have something to do

597
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:47,208
with a missing little girl.
Please, you have to come here.

598
01:06:47,292 --> 01:06:49,917
-Is your daughter missing?
-No, no, no. She's not my daughter.

599
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,667
But my neighbor Eduardo Olivares may have
something to do with her disappearance,

600
01:06:53,750 --> 01:06:55,500
and also Ingrid Morand's.

601
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:57,708
Please, you have to hurry. My address is--

602
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:00,792
I can see your address on my monitor.
My colleagues are on their way.

603
01:07:00,875 --> 01:07:03,208
We ask that
you wait inside your house, please.

604
01:08:26,958 --> 01:08:29,833
No, stand up. Stand up.

605
01:08:32,333 --> 01:08:33,208
You can walk.

606
01:08:35,958 --> 01:08:38,542
Go that way, toward those lights.

607
01:08:42,708 --> 01:08:43,917
You can't talk.

608
01:08:45,917 --> 01:08:47,208
Let me see you go.

609
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,500
I'll come back for you, but you're sick.

610
01:09:00,250 --> 01:09:01,500
Look.

611
01:09:06,583 --> 01:09:09,500
See? Follow the chalk line.

612
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:15,125
Follow the chalk line.

613
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,250
Have the doctors agreed to this?

614
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:49,875
Have the doctors agreed to this?

615
01:09:50,375 --> 01:09:53,542
That girl should be in a hospital,
looked after by professional doctors.

616
01:09:57,708 --> 01:09:59,583
Have the doctors agreed to this?

617
01:10:20,917 --> 01:10:21,958
What did she say?

618
01:10:22,042 --> 01:10:24,333
It's random words,
nothing understandable.

619
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:28,000
A psychologist thinks
she'll start talking little by little.

620
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:30,792
She said "mama."
She probably lived with her.

621
01:10:30,875 --> 01:10:33,375
-And her dad?
-Nothing about him.

622
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:35,542
Are you gonna
teach her to speak, then?

623
01:10:35,625 --> 01:10:38,208
We're wondering if it's
a matter of her gaining confidence.

624
01:10:38,292 --> 01:10:40,583
You need a glass.

625
01:10:40,667 --> 01:10:42,333
-Oh, yes.
-I'll go. I'll go.

626
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,333
Thank you.

627
01:11:32,375 --> 01:11:33,208
Clara?

628
01:11:49,667 --> 01:11:53,542
What are you doing in here alone?
Do you want some water or juice?

629
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:04,417
What are you doing? Drawing?

630
01:12:21,708 --> 01:12:23,375
Hey, the washing machine broke.

631
01:12:27,958 --> 01:12:28,833
Good morning.

632
01:12:35,625 --> 01:12:36,958
Everything's fine!

633
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:55,208
-Is there more?
-No, but I can make you something else.

634
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,208
It's okay.

635
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:59,458
Get the leftovers from the fridge.

636
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:01,333
It's no trouble.

637
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:03,750
How would you like an omelet?

638
01:13:03,833 --> 01:13:06,000
Just take out the leftovers in the fridge.

639
01:13:15,875 --> 01:13:16,708
Maite.

640
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:20,417
What?

641
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:23,417
I had put those beans aside for tomorrow.

642
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:26,542
What for?

643
01:13:28,333 --> 01:13:29,458
Don't you remember?

644
01:13:30,042 --> 01:13:32,250
You're on your own tomorrow.
I won't be here.

645
01:13:33,125 --> 01:13:34,000
Where are you going?

646
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,875
I'm going to Barcelona to see the boys.

647
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:43,083
I told you,
they've finished all their exams.

648
01:13:45,083 --> 01:13:46,542
You didn't tell me.

649
01:13:49,833 --> 01:13:50,958
Did you forget?

650
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:54,167
You told me I could go.
You gave me permission.

651
01:13:56,958 --> 01:13:57,792
No.

652
01:13:58,292 --> 01:14:01,542
You even told me where to have lunch,
where you went that time.

653
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:05,125
-When you went with your co-workers.
-Well, as you wish.

654
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:07,792
But tomorrow we agreed
to meet Paula and Simón.

655
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:10,542
But you can go without me, right?

656
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,333
Why don't you call the boys, hmm?

657
01:14:17,917 --> 01:14:21,292
And you can tell them to come here.
It's been so long.

658
01:14:29,708 --> 01:14:30,917
I think they're busy.

659
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,583
I thought you said
they finished their exams.

660
01:14:33,667 --> 01:14:36,333
They might have started their classes
for the second term.

661
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:37,583
They work hard.

662
01:14:37,667 --> 01:14:40,875
I think they could come home
for a couple days if they wanted, hmm?

663
01:14:48,958 --> 01:14:49,792
You're right.

664
01:14:53,292 --> 01:14:54,958
Paula and Simón are not well.

665
01:14:56,208 --> 01:14:57,750
I can go some other time.

666
01:15:00,167 --> 01:15:01,333
Are you sure?

667
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:03,417
Yes.

668
01:15:17,583 --> 01:15:19,250
-Do you have to work?
-Yes.

669
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,083
And the police?

670
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,042
They are stumped.

671
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,583
-What are they saying?
-They thought she ran away.

672
01:15:49,667 --> 01:15:52,000
But there's a detective
who believes Paula,

673
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:53,958
so they're investigating more.

674
01:15:54,042 --> 01:15:56,708
The most important thing is
for her to get back to normal.

675
01:15:56,792 --> 01:15:58,583
Do you think
someone took the girl?

676
01:15:58,667 --> 01:16:02,167
No. Well, I don't know.
I hope she's not in that swamp.

677
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,667
Don't say that. Paula.

678
01:16:06,167 --> 01:16:07,083
How are you?

679
01:16:08,333 --> 01:16:09,167
Fine.

680
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,167
Is there any news?

681
01:16:13,833 --> 01:16:15,708
You only slept for two hours.

682
01:16:16,583 --> 01:16:18,083
You had time to clean.

683
01:16:20,917 --> 01:16:22,292
Are you okay?

684
01:16:22,375 --> 01:16:24,083
Come back to the office.

685
01:16:24,167 --> 01:16:26,667
If you don't,
they'll take your projects away.

686
01:16:26,750 --> 01:16:29,958
It's always nice
to get back to normal, Paula.

687
01:16:30,042 --> 01:16:31,583
Tell her, she'll be happy.

688
01:16:39,667 --> 01:16:42,208
Well, do you know
they're moving my due date up?

689
01:16:42,292 --> 01:16:43,458
Really?

690
01:16:43,542 --> 01:16:46,000
It'll be born
on the same day as Beltrán.

691
01:16:46,750 --> 01:16:48,417
They told us on the way here.

692
01:16:48,500 --> 01:16:50,250
What a coincidence.

693
01:17:00,083 --> 01:17:00,917
What?

694
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:04,417
I don't know, Paula.
What do you think?

695
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:06,000
What do I think?

696
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:11,625
I'm really happy for you, Beltrán.

697
01:17:12,333 --> 01:17:15,333
-Paula, they're just cheering you up.
-Just shut up.

698
01:17:15,417 --> 01:17:17,292
-Paula, relax.
-Hey!

699
01:17:18,125 --> 01:17:20,625
-Can you get out of my house, please?
-Paula.

700
01:17:20,708 --> 01:17:21,875
Can you all go?

701
01:17:23,125 --> 01:17:25,333
-Let's go.
-I'll see you out.

702
01:18:22,875 --> 01:18:23,708
Hello.

703
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,333
Hello.

704
01:18:30,250 --> 01:18:31,375
You okay?

705
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:32,958
Yes.

706
01:18:35,125 --> 01:18:36,167
Are you alone?

707
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:37,583
Yeah.

708
01:18:38,833 --> 01:18:39,667
Why?

709
01:18:40,875 --> 01:18:44,083
Maite told me to come over
and pick something up.

710
01:18:45,542 --> 01:18:46,375
What?

711
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:48,792
Some maps.

712
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:51,000
She said I could borrow them.

713
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:53,083
Oh, she didn't tell me.

714
01:18:57,000 --> 01:18:58,083
Well, come in.

715
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:01,292
I'll find them.

716
01:19:09,833 --> 01:19:11,417
Let's see if they're here.

717
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:13,750
Why do you need maps?

718
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,958
I'm going to keep looking.

719
01:19:17,625 --> 01:19:18,708
For the girl?

720
01:19:19,917 --> 01:19:20,917
Yes.

721
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:24,083
Have you heard anything?

722
01:19:25,042 --> 01:19:25,875
Nothing.

723
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:48,208
That Maite.

724
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:54,333
Wait a second. They might be in here.

725
01:23:50,917 --> 01:23:53,250
-Yes.
-Are you Eduardo Olivares?

726
01:23:53,333 --> 01:23:54,542
Yes, that's me.

727
01:23:54,625 --> 01:23:56,167
We received a call.

728
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:58,375
We would like to ask you
some questions if possible.

729
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,917
Paula Ejea called you,
didn't she?

730
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:03,500
Ah, don't stay out there. Come in.

731
01:25:27,167 --> 01:25:28,750
I told the police.

732
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:30,625
They're gone now.

733
01:25:35,333 --> 01:25:38,375
They'll find me.

734
01:25:41,542 --> 01:25:43,500
Tell me, Paula, how did you know?

735
01:25:51,625 --> 01:25:52,917
I found Ingrid.

736
01:25:54,208 --> 01:25:55,583
You found Ingrid?

737
01:25:57,417 --> 01:25:58,750
Ingrid's autopsy.

738
01:26:01,042 --> 01:26:01,875
Where?

739
01:26:09,167 --> 01:26:10,208
Where, Paula?

740
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:13,417
It's in-- I left it in my car.

741
01:26:18,375 --> 01:26:20,208
Are you lying right now?

742
01:26:22,667 --> 01:26:24,417
-Are you lying to me?
-No.

743
01:28:10,875 --> 01:28:11,875
Paula?

744
01:28:21,292 --> 01:28:23,875
Clara, listen to me, please.

745
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:27,125
This is very important.
I need you to help me.

746
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:29,042
Will you do that?

747
01:28:34,167 --> 01:28:36,833
Watch very carefully. Look here.

748
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:46,042
Clara, take this.

749
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:55,625
Too far.

750
01:29:10,667 --> 01:29:12,958
I have it!

751
01:29:25,333 --> 01:29:27,458
Try please and if you want, we can stop.

752
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:31,167
-No, don't-- don't want to.
-Clara, listen to me.

753
01:29:31,250 --> 01:29:33,917
You don't have to be afraid, please.

754
01:29:37,708 --> 01:29:39,292
I know it's difficult, honey,

755
01:29:40,583 --> 01:29:42,000
but you can do it.

756
01:29:42,875 --> 01:29:46,042
Do you know why?
Because you're the bravest girl I know.

757
01:29:48,167 --> 01:29:49,875
I haven't met anyone in this world

758
01:29:49,958 --> 01:29:52,583
who is as brave of a person
as you are, my dear.

759
01:29:54,417 --> 01:29:55,750
So please, Clara.

760
01:29:57,875 --> 01:29:59,000
Do it for both of us.

761
01:30:33,792 --> 01:30:35,667
Clara, are you in the closet?

762
01:30:35,750 --> 01:30:38,458
I don't want
Mama's punishment here.

763
01:30:38,542 --> 01:30:39,958
Was your mama here?

764
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:43,917
Yeah.

765
01:30:47,667 --> 01:30:49,375
Your mama's name was Ingrid?

766
01:30:51,125 --> 01:30:53,375
Yeah.

767
01:32:11,875 --> 01:32:13,042
Where is she?

768
01:32:21,250 --> 01:32:22,083
Clara.

769
01:32:24,625 --> 01:32:25,458
Honey.

770
01:32:38,667 --> 01:32:39,833
Where is she?

771
01:32:43,542 --> 01:32:47,792
Where is she?

772
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:53,542
Where is she?

773
01:33:00,083 --> 01:33:03,500
Tell me now! Where is she?

774
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:07,542
Clara!

775
01:33:11,000 --> 01:33:12,292
Clara!

776
01:33:13,125 --> 01:33:15,875
Clara! Clara! Clara!

777
01:34:37,875 --> 01:34:38,708
Simón!

778
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:40,625
Simón!

779
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,375
Simón!

780
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:55,875
Simón!

781
01:35:01,125 --> 01:35:02,167
Simón!

782
01:35:04,250 --> 01:35:05,667
Simón!

783
01:35:50,833 --> 01:35:52,375
Simón!

784
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:54,708
Yes, I just got home.
She's not here.

785
01:35:55,958 --> 01:35:56,958
Simón!

786
01:35:57,708 --> 01:35:59,750
How can she contact me
if they took her phone?

787
01:36:00,500 --> 01:36:02,292
-Simón!
-Hello.

788
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:09,292
What are you doing here?

789
01:36:10,708 --> 01:36:11,667
Are you Clara?

790
01:36:12,625 --> 01:36:13,542
Are you all right?

791
01:36:16,833 --> 01:36:17,750
Where's Paula?

792
01:36:34,708 --> 01:36:35,625
Calm down.

793
01:36:40,708 --> 01:36:42,375
Calm down, relax.

794
01:36:43,833 --> 01:36:44,792
It's all fine.

795
01:36:46,667 --> 01:36:49,458
Relax, come here. Come here.

796
01:36:51,375 --> 01:36:52,750
Everything's fine.

797
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:56,417
It's over. Calm down.

798
01:37:08,875 --> 01:37:09,917
Simón!

799
01:37:13,708 --> 01:37:17,458
What do you mean stay at home?
No, no, no, no, no, you listen to me.

800
01:38:07,625 --> 01:38:09,125
This is how things will work.

801
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:19,542
I'll go to see the boys whenever I want.

802
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:26,917
You'll give me money
for the tickets and for food.

803
01:38:27,792 --> 01:38:30,417
I'll go, and then I'll come home.

804
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:31,833
I'll be here as usual.

805
01:38:33,083 --> 01:38:36,625
But you'll never ask about them again,
and they never have to come back here.

806
01:38:44,292 --> 01:38:45,417
And the basement?

807
01:38:53,792 --> 01:38:54,625
Thank you.

808
01:38:59,667 --> 01:39:02,625
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for my sons.

809
01:39:03,833 --> 01:39:04,792
And now?

810
01:39:07,833 --> 01:39:09,417
Now I'll make some coffee.

811
01:39:38,750 --> 01:39:40,833
I'm going out to the garden for a while.

812
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:17,042
Police!
Hands in the air! Don't move!

813
01:40:18,167 --> 01:40:19,042
Where are they?

814
01:40:21,458 --> 01:40:23,500
Did you hear me? Where are they?

815
01:41:21,292 --> 01:41:23,917
Hey, there!

816
01:41:24,000 --> 01:41:26,125
-How are you?
-Great!

817
01:41:27,083 --> 01:41:31,000
Great! Oh, my love.
I'm so happy to see you.

818
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:32,250
You look great.

819
01:41:32,333 --> 01:41:33,917
How's your grandmother?

820
01:41:34,458 --> 01:41:35,375
Oma?

821
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:38,125
Pass the phone to her later.
I wanna say hello.

822
01:41:38,708 --> 01:41:40,958
It looks beautiful in Hamburg.

823
01:41:41,708 --> 01:41:42,792
Sunny!

824
01:41:43,833 --> 01:41:44,792
Look here.

825
01:41:44,875 --> 01:41:47,375
It's cloudy today, see?

826
01:41:50,542 --> 01:41:52,125
How's your ankle doing?

827
01:41:52,208 --> 01:41:54,083
Can you walk on it? A bit?

828
01:41:54,625 --> 01:41:57,875
That's amazing!

829
01:41:57,958 --> 01:41:59,167
Simón.

830
01:41:59,792 --> 01:42:01,958
Look who just got home. Hang on a moment.

831
01:42:06,750 --> 01:42:08,917
Simón, come here. I'm talking to Clara.
