613
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,520
London and I'd help to see Bella I'm

614
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:40,700
sorry but my wife is unable to see you

615
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,140
mr. Bao this is little difficult to

616
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:46,470
explain but you may remember that at the

617
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:48,030
time of your marriage there was a slight

618
00:56:48,030 --> 00:56:49,440
friction between us

619
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:52,710
I was peculiarly alive to the my

620
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,510
sister and I have long regretted these

621
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:56,099
differences they've kept us separated

622
00:56:56,099 --> 00:56:57,329
from Bella too long

623
00:56:57,329 --> 00:57:01,349
in Europe in yin we're anxious to see

624
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:03,150
her again never stay with us in Devon so

625
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:04,680
the air always used to do her so much

626
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,630
good down there you are under the

627
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:09,329
impression she's ill well and what has

628
00:57:09,329 --> 00:57:11,250
given you that impression she was never

629
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:13,680
strong I am the best guardian of my

630
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,380
wife's health all the same I should like

631
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:18,510
to see my cousin when I was with me when

632
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,299
we heard you arrived if she had wished

633
00:57:21,299 --> 00:57:23,490
to see you she wouldn't have asked me to

634
00:57:23,490 --> 00:57:26,910
speak to you down here she refused to

635
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:27,540
see me

636
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:29,790
the inference appears to be perfectly

637
00:57:29,790 --> 00:57:32,790
clear I don't think I like your tone

638

642
00:57:49,240 --> 00:57:52,380
interfere between a husband and wife

643
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:55,570

you are sweet animal

666
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:41,910
oh I'm desperate if I do the things you

667
00:59:41,910 --> 00:59:45,150
say then I am going mad it's when you're

668
00:59:45,150 --> 00:59:49,470
angry with me like this my head aches my

669
00:59:49,470 --> 00:59:55,349
mind gets tired we must help me Paul if

670
00:59:55,349 --> 00:59:56,730
you would have flicked it I would be

671
00:59:56,730 --> 01:00:04,380
gentle I should love you more how can

672
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:11,220
you he was not to be it's only since we

673
01:00:11,220 --> 01:00:17,750
came to this house everything's changed

674
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:20,910
it must be because of that envelope I

675
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:25,680
found who was Louie beau

676
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:29,819
there's no such person as Louie why

677
01:00:29,819 --> 01:00:31,890
should that have changed our lives just

678
01:00:31,890 --> 01:00:34,770
a name on an old envelope it's never

679
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:38,940
even an umbrella that was the beginning

680
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,069
of your madness then I realize you were

681
01:00:41,069 --> 01:00:43,020
a half-witted creature prize for my desk

682
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:46,230
and my papers but this is the end

683
01:00:46,230 --> 01:00:49,970
you understand you made your dangerous

684
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:52,500
you're going to see a doctor madam

685
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:59,839
no more than one doctor tomorrow morning

686
01:01:27,279 --> 01:01:29,839
and I can't understand this my cousin

687
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:33,170
not wanting to see which is his wife I

688
01:01:33,170 --> 01:01:35,150
couldn't force him to let me see her but

689
01:01:35,150 --> 01:01:36,380
surely there must be something we can do

690
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,930
to help nothing you can go now it won't

691
01:01:38,930 --> 01:01:40,579
let him get really afraid of your

692
01:01:40,579 --> 01:01:43,009
interference this cameraman will take

693
01:01:43,009 --> 01:01:45,829
you back to your tale is very kind but I

694
01:01:45,829 --> 01:01:47,450
hate leaving to deal with all this after

695
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,069
all I am her cousin well I can perhaps

696
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:51,469
use methods that you can't I may need

697
01:01:51,469 --> 01:01:53,269
your influence to get a warrant if I

698
01:01:53,269 --> 01:01:55,759
can't get my evidence good but he won't

699
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:57,140
risk anything that'll lead to an inquiry

the merderet searched for those rubies

747
01:05:49,210 --> 01:05:51,190
all through the night and the opinion of

748
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:52,540
the police was that he found him and

749
01:05:52,540 --> 01:05:54,550
vanished with him they never caught him

01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:58,270
no but suppose he didn't find those

01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:01,030
rumors after all suppose they were

752
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:03,820
concealed in the walls or the floor of

01:06:03,820 --> 01:06:06,670

01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,660
a criminal maniac who murdered his aunt

775
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:39,450
and steals back to his own house at

776
01:07:39,450 --> 01:07:42,000
night still searching for those rubies

777
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,730
he couldn't find 20 years ago and every

778
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,350
time he lights the gas up in that room

779
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:54,390
so it dims down here sir I hear his key

780
01:07:54,390 --> 01:07:57,080
in the door few minutes afterwards I

781
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,090
can't stand it my mind

782
01:08:00,090 --> 01:08:02,460
oh you're not going out of your mind

783
01:08:02,460 --> 01:08:04,680
mrs. Mellon you're slowly and

784
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,420
methodically being driven out of your

785
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:06,780
mind

786
01:08:06,780 --> 01:08:09,090
why because quite Paxton's you got into

787
01:08:09,090 --> 01:08:10,800
his identity and that made you dangerous

788
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,570
to him he couldn't get rid of you by

789
01:08:12,570 --> 01:08:15,360
ordinary means for fear of an inquiry so

790
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,939
he's driving you mad in order to

791
01:08:17,939 --> 01:08:19,859
discredit anything that you say as the

792
01:08:19,859 --> 01:08:22,529
ravings of a lunatic thank god you're

793
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:26,870
not married to him not married to

794
01:08:26,870 --> 01:08:28,920
certainly not he married another lady

795
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:30,630
long before he met you and she is still

796
01:08:30,630 --> 01:08:32,690
alive

Louie Bowers identity I don't know where

805
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:56,710
to find it so you can tell me where to

806
01:08:56,710 --> 01:09:01,448
look yes but in here you don't

807
01:09:01,448 --> 01:09:05,729
understand to me is still my husband I

808
01:09:05,729 --> 01:09:08,618
couldn't betray my husband you mean the

809
01:09:08,618 --> 01:09:10,328
man who betrayed you into thinking you

810
01:09:10,328 --> 01:09:12,009
were married to him that's different

811
01:09:12,009 --> 01:09:15,670
it was before I knew him we've lived

812
01:09:15,670 --> 01:09:17,319
together as husband and wife if I

813
01:09:17,319 --> 01:09:18,880
betrayed him I'd be betraying myself

814
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,859
even though I tell you that this moment

815
01:09:20,859 --> 01:09:22,630
he's sitting in a music hall with

816
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:29,139
another woman your parlor maid - it's

817

hard to take everything from you

818
01:09:30,759 --> 01:09:40,658

wanted to be a gardener or a burglar

833
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:32,420
both of nice quiet occupations versus

834
01:10:32,420 --> 01:10:38,070
tougher than I thought you mustn't force

835
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:38,790
