00:06.000 --> 00:12.074


02:47.990 --> 02:49.690
Oh, this is great!

02:49.690 --> 02:50.690
Wow!

02:50.690 --> 02:51.790
Oh, that's incredible.

02:51.790 --> 02:54.390
There's got to be seven
or eight feet up there.

02:54.890 --> 02:57.390
And eighty years of dust.

02:57.890 --> 02:59.090
Look at all this height.

02:59.190 --> 03:00.390
We could put our
bedroom upstairs

03:00.390 --> 03:01.989
and that will leave us with
all this space.

03:01.989 --> 03:03.389
For what?

03:03.389 --> 03:05.589
Just space.

03:06.190 --> 03:07.790
One!

03:07.891 --> 03:09.491
Two!

03:09.491 --> 03:11.090
Three!

03:12.490 --> 03:14.690
- And four?
- Come on.

03:16.491 --> 03:18.291
And five?

03:20.190 --> 03:21.690
Watch, watch!

03:21.690 --> 03:23.990
God, this place is huge.

03:26.790 --> 03:27.990
It's beautiful.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.689
God!

03:29.789 --> 03:31.990
You guys, it's absolutely incredible.

03:32.190 --> 03:34.190
Incredible.

03:34.190 --> 03:35.790
A little paint.

03:36.090 --> 03:38.389
Sell it tomorrow,
double your money.

03:38.489 --> 03:40.790
Carl, you're obsessed.

03:40.890 --> 03:42.591
A little bit.

03:42.591 --> 03:44.791
Wow, look!

03:46.490 --> 03:48.490
Hey, it's an Indian head penny.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.890
1898.

03:52.890 --> 03:54.890
It's a good omen.

03:55.590 --> 03:57.990
You're the good omen.

04:01.589 --> 04:03.490
Oh, it's so great!

04:12.988 --> 04:16.288
I had Rose move your 3 o'clock
with Bob Kahan to 4 o'clock.

04:17.088 --> 04:18.889
Gary Alan called at the end
of the day yesterday.

04:18.889 --> 04:22.289
He has to see you about the
final painting bids for the loft.

04:22.389 --> 04:24.889
3 o'clock is the only time
he can make it. Is that OK?

04:25.789 --> 04:27.490
Sam?

04:30.190 --> 04:31.889
Ah? I'm sorry.

04:31.889 --> 04:34.689
Relax, man. This is
not brain surgery.

04:35.089 --> 04:37.989
Pitching these Japanese guys
makes me so nervous.

04:38.689 --> 04:40.188
Sam...

04:40.288 --> 04:42.388
You're going to be great. OK?

04:42.988 --> 04:44.789
What am I supposed to say?

04:44.789 --> 04:48.788
I can't really tell them my
Swedish girl joke, you know.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.488
Great. Where did
you get those?

04:50.488 --> 04:52.489
Nice, huh? Molly.

04:52.489 --> 04:54.890
What do you think?
Are they me?

04:55.090 --> 04:57.090
Oh, man. Look at
that, a Testarossa.

04:57.190 --> 04:58.089
Wow.

04:58.089 --> 05:00.789
- Ouch!
- Pay off your Mustang first.

05:11.489 --> 05:12.589
How are you?

05:12.589 --> 05:14.189
What did the doctor say?

05:14.189 --> 05:15.989
He said that it was contagious.

05:15.989 --> 05:16.989
That it was really...

05:17.089 --> 05:18.789
- No?
- Yeah.

05:18.789 --> 05:21.689
He said I shouldn't
even be coming in today.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.189
What about the rash?

05:25.488 --> 05:26.588
The rash?

05:26.888 --> 05:28.789
The rash is...

05:28.989 --> 05:30.289
also incredibly contagious.

05:30.289 --> 05:32.190
He said they've
both been spreading.

05:32.190 --> 05:33.989
No?

05:37.089 --> 05:39.290
On your genitals again?

05:39.390 --> 05:40.690
Yeah.

05:40.690 --> 05:42.689
Yeah, right on the genitals.

05:43.089 --> 05:44.589
Basically everywhere.

05:44.589 --> 05:46.489
He said that I
shouldn't touch anyone.

05:47.787 --> 05:49.687
Excuse me, I'm sorry.

05:53.286 --> 05:54.987
- You're sick.
- I know.

05:54.987 --> 05:56.387
Morning, Paul.

05:56.487 --> 05:58.687
- Carl, Sam.
- Save it, Paul.

06:00.086 --> 06:01.786
Morning, Susie.
You're looking good.

06:01.786 --> 06:03.087
Sam.

06:03.087 --> 06:05.088
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:07.188 --> 06:09.287
- Here it is.
- Thanks.

06:11.587 --> 06:13.387
- Morning, Sam.
- Morning, Rose.

06:13.387 --> 06:14.487
Listen, the Kobiashi people...

06:14.487 --> 06:16.587
They're already here.

06:16.687 --> 06:18.687
- They're early!
- I know.

06:18.687 --> 06:21.287
- Come here.
- Andy Dillon called...

06:21.287 --> 06:23.486
- How long have they been here?
- About ten minutes.

06:23.486 --> 06:24.486
Andy Dillon called.

06:24.486 --> 06:28.086
And he says he needs $ 900,000
transferred to Albany by ten.

06:28.086 --> 06:30.086
- By ten?
- Yes.

06:32.786 --> 06:33.886
- Carl?

06:33.886 --> 06:35.386
Yeah?

06:38.085 --> 06:40.886
Dillon needs 900,000 in Albany by ten.

06:41.086 --> 06:42.587
Can you transfer it
to his account?

06:42.587 --> 06:44.287
Yeah, but I need your MAC code.

06:44.287 --> 06:46.186
OK.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.786
Discretion, right?

06:53.786 --> 06:54.886
Got it.

06:54.886 --> 06:56.286
You bet.
I'll do it right now.

06:56.386 --> 06:57.686
Thanks.

06:57.686 --> 06:59.586
Bill, I'll call
you back.

07:10.586 --> 07:12.185
OK, that's fine.

07:12.285 --> 07:13.986
That's fine.

07:15.286 --> 07:17.487
Oh, man, this
is too far out.

07:18.887 --> 07:20.886
Can you get this, man?

07:21.886 --> 07:22.886
Where you guys from

07:22.986 --> 07:24.886
the New York City Ballet?

07:29.186 --> 07:31.186
Almost.

07:34.986 --> 07:35.986
Saved your life!

07:35.986 --> 07:37.486
You shit!

07:37.486 --> 07:38.686
You scared me to death.

07:38.686 --> 07:39.786
Why did you do that?

07:39.786 --> 07:43.086
It's better than seeing this gorgeous
body splattered all over the place.

07:43.286 --> 07:45.186
Look out!

07:51.385 --> 07:52.086
Grab it!

07:52.086 --> 07:54.187
Sam, Moll!
Are you guys home?

07:54.187 --> 07:55.287
Carl! Did you invite him?

07:55.287 --> 07:56.386
Slave labour.

07:56.386 --> 07:57.886
- Carl!
- What?

07:57.886 --> 07:59.786
- Hurry, help!
- Oh, my God.

07:59.786 --> 08:01.286
Grab the bottom.

08:01.286 --> 08:03.087
Now, go there.

08:04.787 --> 08:05.786
Right here?

08:05.786 --> 08:07.686
Watch your toes.

08:08.586 --> 08:09.686
Where do you want this?

08:09.686 --> 08:11.886
In the bedroom.

08:13.586 --> 08:15.685
God, this place looks great!

08:16.185 --> 08:16.985
Yeah.

08:17.085 --> 08:18.086
You like it, huh?

08:18.086 --> 08:19.786
Like? Like is
hardly the word.

08:19.786 --> 08:22.386
I had no idea it would be
this beautiful. It's incredible.

08:22.486 --> 08:23.985
Molly, what about her?

08:23.985 --> 08:26.886
Why don't you just leave her
there until the other stuff is here.

08:26.886 --> 08:28.287
What are these?

08:28.287 --> 08:29.987
Oh, let me show you.

08:30.087 --> 08:31.886
Will you help
me lift this up?

08:34.686 --> 08:35.586
Wow.

08:35.586 --> 08:37.186
Just finished it.
What do you think?

08:37.186 --> 08:39.186
It's fantastic.
I love it.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.486
Sam, what's this
chair doing here?

08:43.785 --> 08:45.086
What do you mean?
I love that chair.

08:45.086 --> 08:47.485
I know you love this chair,
but we discussed this and...

08:47.485 --> 08:49.386
I've had it forever.

08:49.785 --> 08:51.785
When I watch TV, I sit in it.

08:51.885 --> 08:53.485
This chair is ugly.

08:53.685 --> 08:55.785
- So?
- And it doesn't go with anything.

08:55.885 --> 08:57.785
It goes with me.

08:58.285 --> 09:00.284
You're right, it does.

09:01.484 --> 09:03.085
We'll paint it.

09:03.085 --> 09:04.385
We'll what?

09:13.486 --> 09:15.486
Are you OK?

09:16.186 --> 09:18.285
I'm fine.

09:20.885 --> 09:22.985
What's the matter?

09:23.585 --> 09:25.684
Nothing.

09:28.784 --> 09:30.885
Are you worried
about the promotion?

09:33.085 --> 09:35.284
No, not really.

09:44.185 --> 09:45.585
Then what?

09:45.785 --> 09:47.885
Moving in together?

09:47.985 --> 09:49.685
No.

09:53.485 --> 09:54.885
I don't know.
It's...

09:54.885 --> 09:57.185
a lot of things.

10:00.786 --> 10:04.185
I just don't want
the bubble to burst.

10:05.885 --> 10:07.785
It seems like...

10:09.685 --> 10:12.284
whenever anything good
in my life happens

10:12.284 --> 10:14.785
I'm just afraid
I'm going to lose it.

10:20.085 --> 10:22.785
I love you.

10:22.985 --> 10:24.986
I really love you.

10:27.686 --> 10:29.485
Ditto.

10:31.985 --> 10:33.685
The pilot's first report
of trouble was

10:33.685 --> 10:35.185
the blew the number
two engine

10:35.185 --> 10:38.184
the one in the tail of the plane.
It was fully loaded...

10:39.484 --> 10:41.885
Oh, Jesus.
Another one?

10:43.785 --> 10:45.585
Don't watch that.

10:47.184 --> 10:48.885
I should cancel
my LA trip.

10:48.885 --> 10:51.286
These things always
happen in threes.

10:52.886 --> 10:54.985
Sam, get serious!

10:54.985 --> 10:57.485
Besides, you lead
a charmed life.

10:57.885 --> 10:59.585
Yeah, so did they.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.685
It's amazing.

11:02.685 --> 11:03.784
Just like that...

11:03.984 --> 11:05.885
Blackout.

12:13.182 --> 12:15.081
What are you doing?

12:15.982 --> 12:17.982
I couldn't sleep.

12:20.382 --> 12:21.682
Boy.

12:22.582 --> 12:24.582
I really must have
passed out.

12:24.882 --> 12:27.182
What time is it?

12:27.182 --> 12:29.382
It's 2 am.

12:52.582 --> 12:53.782
Oh, no.

12:53.882 --> 12:56.682
I hope it wasn't
a masterpiece.

12:56.682 --> 12:58.982
Well, it's not now.

13:00.781 --> 13:02.081
Can I help?

13:02.181 --> 13:03.081
Yeah.

13:03.081 --> 13:06.282
Put your hands here.
Now get them wet.

13:08.482 --> 13:12.082
Let the clay slide
between your fingers.

16:05.480 --> 16:07.279
Oh, no.

16:08.479 --> 16:10.379
What's the matter?

16:11.079 --> 16:12.980
A glitch.
What's up?

16:12.980 --> 16:16.480
The Greenberg and White accounts,
I can't get in. The macro doesn't work.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.580
I changed it.

16:17.580 --> 16:21.380
- Chaned it? Why?
- I just want to nose around a bit.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.581
Is something wrong?

16:24.981 --> 16:26.980
Can you keep a secret?

16:28.280 --> 16:30.080
Yeah, sure.

16:30.180 --> 16:31.580
What's up?

16:31.580 --> 16:33.480
There's too much money
in these accounts.

16:33.480 --> 16:36.179
Too much money?
That's impossible.

16:41.780 --> 16:44.679
Sam, this is going
to take you hours.

16:44.679 --> 16:47.380
- Let me do this.
- It already has taken me hours.

16:47.380 --> 16:49.481
Well, let me figure
it out for you.

16:49.681 --> 16:50.781
No, it's OK.

16:50.781 --> 16:52.880
It's like a vendetta now.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.580
Thanks, though,
I appreciate it.

16:54.580 --> 16:56.280
OK.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.380
If you start to go
blind, just give a shout.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.180
OK. Adiós.

17:01.279 --> 17:04.680
Listen, I was wandering what are
you and Moll doing tonight?

17:04.880 --> 17:07.680
We're going to the theatre.
She wants to see Macbeth.

17:07.980 --> 17:10.180
I think she likes the
guys in tights.

17:10.579 --> 17:12.780
- You want to go?
- No. Thanks.

17:12.780 --> 17:14.579
I want a full report, though.

17:14.780 --> 17:17.680
- Later.
- Yeah.

17:22.079 --> 17:23.880
Well, I loved it.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.981
I was spellbound
the whole time.

17:25.981 --> 17:28.180
I could tell, and so could
the rest of the audience

17:28.180 --> 17:30.780
with that resonating
snore of yours.

17:37.180 --> 17:39.380
Did I tell you what
Marcia said?

17:39.380 --> 17:40.880
Yeah, about six times.

17:40.980 --> 17:44.178
It wasn't six times.
Quit being so blase about this.

17:44.178 --> 17:45.477
OK. Sorry.

17:45.577 --> 17:46.577
This was really important.

17:46.577 --> 17:48.877
I'm going to have
two pieces in her gallery.

17:48.978 --> 17:52.878
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

17:52.978 --> 17:56.978
Molly, the New York Times is just some
frustrated critic with pimples on his ass

17:56.978 --> 17:58.378
who flunked art school.

17:58.378 --> 18:01.079
Who cares what they think?

18:01.079 --> 18:03.878
About 8 million readers,
that's who.

18:03.878 --> 18:07.778
No, they're just reading
the sports page.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.078
Your work is
really beautiful.

18:10.078 --> 18:12.078
It really is.

18:12.277 --> 18:14.478
And it shouldn't matter
what anyone else thinks

18:14.478 --> 18:16.578
just what I think.

18:21.377 --> 18:23.577
I want to marry you, Sam.

18:23.777 --> 18:25.577
What?

18:26.577 --> 18:27.677
What?

18:27.677 --> 18:29.677
Yeah.

18:29.677 --> 18:31.676
I've been thinking about it.

18:31.676 --> 18:34.176
I've been thinking
about it a lot.

18:34.577 --> 18:37.378
And I think we should just do it.

18:37.478 --> 18:39.377
Are you serious?

18:39.577 --> 18:41.277
Yeah.

18:44.578 --> 18:46.778
What's that look for?

18:50.677 --> 18:54.277
You never wanted
to talk about it.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.677
Do you love me, Sam?

19:06.276 --> 19:08.377
What do you think?

19:09.777 --> 19:11.378
Why don't you ever say it?

19:11.378 --> 19:14.678
What do you mean "why don't I ever say it"?
I say it all the time. I feel like...

19:14.678 --> 19:18.277
You say "ditto."
That's not the same.

19:20.677 --> 19:21.977
People say "I love you"
all the time

19:21.977 --> 19:24.277
and it doesn't
mean anything.

19:27.577 --> 19:31.677
You know, sometimes
you need to hear it.

19:32.677 --> 19:35.077
I need to hear it.

19:35.577 --> 19:37.477
Let's go.

19:45.976 --> 19:46.977
What should we do?

19:46.977 --> 19:48.378
Let me handle it.

19:48.478 --> 19:49.478
What do you want?

19:49.478 --> 19:51.877
Your wallet!
Give it!

19:51.977 --> 19:55.077
Sam, just give it to him.

19:56.378 --> 19:59.477
OK. Just take the money.
Just leave...

19:59.477 --> 20:01.577
No! Sam!

20:01.777 --> 20:03.777
You son of a bitch!

20:05.777 --> 20:07.777
Sam! No!

20:08.576 --> 20:10.276
Somebody help us!

20:10.476 --> 20:12.577
Jesus Christ, Sam!

20:14.177 --> 20:15.477
Just get off him!

20:15.477 --> 20:17.177
Somebody!

20:17.177 --> 20:19.076
Somebody help us!

20:19.176 --> 20:21.077
Sam...

20:22.478 --> 20:24.078
Just stop it!

20:24.078 --> 20:25.978
Stop it, Sam!

20:45.576 --> 20:47.576
Molly?

20:49.276 --> 20:51.176
Molly! You got...?

21:03.176 --> 21:05.676
Oh, baby, hold on.

21:05.776 --> 21:07.877
You're going to be OK.

21:09.777 --> 21:11.176
Somebody?

21:11.276 --> 21:12.876
Somebody!

21:12.876 --> 21:14.876
Somebody help us!

21:14.976 --> 21:16.676
Sam...

21:18.076 --> 21:19.676
Oh, my God!

21:19.776 --> 21:21.675
Oh, Sam, come on.

21:21.775 --> 21:23.276
Hold on, baby.

21:23.776 --> 21:25.976
Somebody's gonna come.

21:26.776 --> 21:28.775
You're going to be OK.

21:34.477 --> 21:37.676
No... Oh, God...

21:38.276 --> 21:40.076
Somebody?

21:40.276 --> 21:42.776
Somebody help me!

21:42.976 --> 21:44.776
Please, anybody!

21:44.776 --> 21:46.975
Help me, please!
Help me!

21:47.076 --> 21:49.276
OK, lady, take it
easy, all right?

21:50.876 --> 21:52.076
We'll help you, OK?

21:52.076 --> 21:56.676
Molly?

21:58.976 --> 22:00.676
<i>OK</i>

22:00.676 --> 22:02.676
<i>All right. Fine.</i>

22:02.776 --> 22:04.875
<i>What shall we do?
What shall we do?</i>

22:14.576 --> 22:16.476
What's happening?

22:16.676 --> 22:18.276
What's...

22:18.276 --> 22:20.877
<i>Is he...
Is he breathing?</i>

22:27.376 --> 22:29.276
<i>Hold on, Sam, hold on.</i>

22:29.276 --> 22:31.275
<i>Don't leave me. Hold on.</i>

22:31.275 --> 22:33.075
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

22:52.976 --> 22:54.876
Here we go.

22:55.376 --> 22:57.076
One...

23:00.176 --> 23:01.576
Sam, don't you leave me!

23:01.576 --> 23:03.475
Sam, hold on!

23:08.775 --> 23:10.775
Jesus...

23:57.074 --> 23:59.974
Miss Jensen, if you would
just step this way, please.

24:16.973 --> 24:18.374
So...

24:18.374 --> 24:20.573
What happened to you?

24:20.773 --> 24:21.773
What?

24:21.773 --> 24:23.873
You're new, huh?
I can tell.

24:24.873 --> 24:25.973
Are you talking to me?

24:25.973 --> 24:27.972
Relax, it ain't like before.

24:27.972 --> 24:30.672
It's a whole new
ball of wax.

24:31.572 --> 24:32.573
Who are you?

24:32.573 --> 24:33.573
Oh, I'm waiting for my wife.

24:33.573 --> 24:37.673
She's in the 4-C, cardiac wing.
She's fighting it.

24:46.573 --> 24:48.073
Shot, huh?

24:48.173 --> 24:50.273
That'll do it every time.

24:50.973 --> 24:52.473
Poor bastard.

24:52.973 --> 24:54.872
You may as well get used to it.

24:54.972 --> 24:57.272
You could be here
for a long while.

25:01.473 --> 25:03.772
Come here.
I'll tell you a secret.

25:03.872 --> 25:05.673
Doors ain't as
bad as you think.

25:05.873 --> 25:07.574
Zip-zap - ain't
nothing at all.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.574
You'll see.
You'll catch on.

25:14.673 --> 25:16.373
He ain't going to make it.

25:16.373 --> 25:17.973
I've seen it
a million times.

25:17.973 --> 25:20.073
He's a goner.

25:25.173 --> 25:26.472
You see?

25:26.472 --> 25:28.372
Here they come.

25:32.072 --> 25:33.772
Lucky bastard!

25:34.072 --> 25:36.272
It could have been
the other ones.

25:36.572 --> 25:38.672
You never know.

25:59.172 --> 26:00.972
Who are they?

26:05.671 --> 26:07.371
No!

26:15.571 --> 26:17.472
Help me!

26:17.572 --> 26:19.773
Oh God.

26:19.773 --> 26:21.673
Help me.

26:27.172 --> 26:29.772
I am sunk in the
abysmal swamp

26:29.772 --> 26:32.371
where there is no foothold.

26:32.371 --> 26:35.172
I have reached
the watery depths.

26:35.272 --> 26:38.272
The flood overwhelms me.

26:38.372 --> 26:40.873
I am wearied with calling.

26:41.672 --> 26:45.372
As we say farewell to
our friend, Sam Wheat

26:46.072 --> 26:48.472
we are reminded
of his kindness

26:49.272 --> 26:51.371
his generosity

26:51.871 --> 26:54.872
his buoyancy of spirit.

26:55.272 --> 26:56.973
All that we treasure

26:57.373 --> 26:59.172
our loved ones

26:59.172 --> 27:00.672
our friends

27:00.672 --> 27:02.772
our body

27:02.972 --> 27:04.773
our mind

27:05.173 --> 27:07.373
are but on loan to us.

27:07.473 --> 27:11.072
We must surrender
them all.

27:11.172 --> 27:13.772
We are all travellers
on the same road

27:13.972 --> 27:16.472
which leads to
the same end.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.572
As our loved one
enters eternal life

27:23.672 --> 27:26.171
Iet us remember that love,
too, is eternal.

27:28.371 --> 27:30.773
That although
we will miss him

27:30.873 --> 27:32.973
our love will light the void

27:32.973 --> 27:35.072
and dispel the darkness.

28:14.371 --> 28:17.272
I picked up your
shirts today.

28:18.772 --> 28:20.971
I don't know why.

28:24.771 --> 28:27.771
Mr Reynolds told me
to tell you "hello."

28:31.170 --> 28:33.271
I broke into tears.

28:36.171 --> 28:39.170
It's like I think about
you every minute.

28:39.570 --> 28:42.472
It's like I can still feel you.

28:52.171 --> 28:54.171
I'm here, Moll.

29:02.671 --> 29:04.771
Floyd, what's the
matter, kitty?

29:05.271 --> 29:07.271
What's the matter?

29:08.171 --> 29:10.171
Crazy cat.

29:13.870 --> 29:15.670
Sam?

29:18.271 --> 29:20.172
It's stupid.

29:31.471 --> 29:33.371
I love this picture.

29:33.771 --> 29:35.371
It's great.

29:35.371 --> 29:37.569
Office.

29:45.869 --> 29:47.369
Let me see that.

29:47.669 --> 29:49.368
- It's a...
- Sam's address book.

29:49.468 --> 29:51.369
Right.

29:57.370 --> 29:59.169
Dave Brubeck,
New Port, 88.

29:59.169 --> 30:01.269
- Should I toss them?
- No.

30:01.469 --> 30:04.569
No? Molly, we hated
that concert.

30:08.069 --> 30:09.569
You wanted to save those?

30:09.569 --> 30:11.168
Rolaids?

30:11.168 --> 30:13.868
Molly, what are you doing?..

30:21.468 --> 30:24.567
I just miss him, Carl.

30:25.067 --> 30:27.267
Me, too.

30:29.468 --> 30:30.468
Carl?

30:30.468 --> 30:32.869
- Yeah?
- Wait a minute. Wait.

30:33.468 --> 30:35.668
- What?
- Not that one.
- Wich?

30:36.368 --> 30:38.268
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to put that on there.

30:38.268 --> 30:40.069
It's OK.

30:40.369 --> 30:42.169
Hey, Moll.

30:42.468 --> 30:43.768
Why don't you come?

30:43.768 --> 30:45.668
It's like summer outside.

30:45.668 --> 30:48.068
No, I really...
I'm not up for it.

30:48.068 --> 30:50.068
Come on, Moll, just for a walk.
It would be good for you to get out.

30:50.068 --> 30:51.467
I don't want to.

30:51.967 --> 30:53.667
You can't stay
in here all day.

30:53.667 --> 30:56.568
- It's not healthy for you.
- Look Carl, I can't do it!

30:57.868 --> 31:00.367
You're not the one who died.

31:04.068 --> 31:06.169
- I'm sorry.
- Don't apologise.

31:07.169 --> 31:09.268
Shit.

31:12.568 --> 31:14.568
Maybe you're right.

31:14.868 --> 31:17.368
- Maybe a short one.
- That a girl!

31:20.968 --> 31:22.768
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

31:22.768 --> 31:23.968
Molly!

32:25.568 --> 32:27.668
What are you doing here?

32:28.268 --> 32:30.268
Bastard.

32:32.368 --> 32:34.267
You son of a bitch!

32:51.066 --> 32:52.967
What do you want?

32:54.368 --> 32:56.367
Molly?

32:57.167 --> 32:58.967
Molly, get out!

32:59.267 --> 33:01.167
God.

33:05.367 --> 33:08.667
No, Molly!
No, please.

33:11.067 --> 33:11.967
Molly!

33:11.967 --> 33:13.667
He's got a gun, Molly!

33:13.667 --> 33:15.866
Hi, kitty.

33:16.866 --> 33:18.767
You hurt her...
OK...

33:45.267 --> 33:47.167
Shit!

33:49.367 --> 33:51.267
Is somebody there?

33:51.367 --> 33:52.967
Hello?

33:54.367 --> 33:56.367
Hello?

35:14.065 --> 35:15.866
Let go!
What are you doing?

35:20.766 --> 35:22.766
Like trains?

35:33.464 --> 35:35.864
Stay out!
This is mine.

36:53.364 --> 36:55.164
Shit.

37:05.565 --> 37:07.964
It's me.
I couldn't get it.

37:08.564 --> 37:10.664
She came home.

37:10.964 --> 37:12.264
Give me a couple of days.

37:12.264 --> 37:14.264
I'll go back.

37:14.664 --> 37:15.763
Relax.

37:15.763 --> 37:17.764
I'll get it.

37:18.864 --> 37:20.963
Get what?

37:22.963 --> 37:24.663
Who are you?

37:24.663 --> 37:26.763
What do you
want from us?

37:31.563 --> 37:33.562
No.

37:33.862 --> 37:35.962
You stay away from her.

37:37.062 --> 37:38.963
Do you hear me?

37:38.963 --> 37:41.164
Stay away from her!

38:43.563 --> 38:45.562
Rosa Santiago?

38:51.264 --> 38:53.364
Please be seated.

39:08.963 --> 39:11.562
Our sister will
be with us soon.

39:14.462 --> 39:16.363
Sister Oda Mae

39:16.363 --> 39:20.063
grant us the gift of your
all-seeing presence.

39:20.662 --> 39:22.762
Appear before us now.

39:28.864 --> 39:30.563
Mrs Santiago?

39:31.563 --> 39:32.663
Buenos dias.

39:32.863 --> 39:35.063
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

39:35.163 --> 39:37.263
I understand you wish
to contact your husband.

39:37.363 --> 39:40.363
- Si.
- I believe he'll be with us today.

39:40.363 --> 39:42.263
Thank you.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.362
Thank you.

39:43.362 --> 39:45.462
But you know,
Mrs Santiago

39:46.162 --> 39:49.062
there's no telling about
that other world

39:49.162 --> 39:51.662
so you've got to be
a believer, Mrs Santiago.

39:51.862 --> 39:53.362
Are you a believer?

39:53.362 --> 39:56.661
Si, si, I believe.
I believe.

39:56.861 --> 39:59.161
Then let us begin.

40:20.062 --> 40:22.262
I can't.

40:22.762 --> 40:24.261
It's too difficult.

40:24.261 --> 40:27.762
I just can't seem to make
contact. I don't feel his...

40:27.762 --> 40:29.262
No - wait!

40:29.362 --> 40:31.462
I'm feeling something.

40:32.161 --> 40:36.463
Did he know someone
by the name of Anna?

40:38.163 --> 40:40.063
Consuelo?

40:40.463 --> 40:42.262
Lucita?

40:42.262 --> 40:43.362
Julietta?

40:43.362 --> 40:44.962
Josephina?
Linda?

40:45.062 --> 40:46.162
Maria?

40:46.262 --> 40:48.762
Si, si.
His Mama!

40:48.962 --> 40:50.262
She is Maria.

40:50.362 --> 40:54.362
Yes! Praise God.
I knew he was with his Mama.

40:54.662 --> 40:56.462
Oh, my God.

41:02.462 --> 41:03.962
It's too difficult.
It's two of them.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.862
I'm not sure I
can do that.

41:05.862 --> 41:07.561
It's so tiring.

41:07.961 --> 41:09.961
I pay more!
How much?

41:10.361 --> 41:11.261
How much?

41:11.261 --> 41:12.362
Twenty dollars.

41:12.462 --> 41:14.963
Way to go.
Milk her for every penny.

41:32.460 --> 41:36.159
Yes. I...
I believe we can start again.

41:50.461 --> 41:52.160
Praise the Lord!

41:52.160 --> 41:54.260
Thank you, Jesus.

42:10.559 --> 42:12.659
Welcome, Mrs Santiago.

42:13.359 --> 42:16.059
You are fortunate today,
the spirits are churning.

42:16.059 --> 42:17.359
My husband?

42:17.359 --> 42:18.859
Mercy!

42:18.859 --> 42:20.758
Oh, yeah?
Where?

42:22.958 --> 42:24.159
Julio?

42:24.159 --> 42:25.960
Yes!

42:26.660 --> 42:29.259
I feel his vibration.

42:32.459 --> 42:33.760
I see him.

42:34.060 --> 42:36.060
How is he?
How does he look?

42:36.160 --> 42:38.159
He's a handsome man.

42:39.959 --> 42:41.659
Handsome?

42:42.159 --> 42:44.659
Mrs Santiago, in our
Father's Kingdom

42:44.659 --> 42:46.558
we're all handsome.

42:46.558 --> 42:48.658
Oh, Julio.

42:49.259 --> 42:50.859
Julio is coming
towards us.

42:50.959 --> 42:53.159
I see him!
He's coming.

42:54.159 --> 42:55.958
He's there.

42:58.759 --> 43:01.060
He's dressed
in a black suit.

43:02.860 --> 43:04.759
Black suit?

43:05.759 --> 43:07.359
Could be blue.

43:07.459 --> 43:10.159
What a crock of shit.

43:10.259 --> 43:11.759
Who is that?

43:11.759 --> 43:13.359
- Julio!
- Where are you?

43:13.359 --> 43:14.659
Julio? Julio?

43:14.659 --> 43:15.759
Did you hear it?

43:15.759 --> 43:18.059
Oh, damn!
Where are you?

43:18.059 --> 43:19.159
Julio?

43:19.259 --> 43:19.959
Who are you?

43:19.959 --> 43:21.759
Who?..

43:22.759 --> 43:24.659
You can hear me?

43:24.959 --> 43:26.059
Can't you hear him?

43:26.059 --> 43:27.959
I don't believe this.
Hey, you!

43:27.959 --> 43:29.759
My name is Sam Wheat.

43:29.759 --> 43:31.558
Can you hear me? Sam Wheat!
Say my name, say it.

43:31.558 --> 43:33.558
Leave me alone!

43:34.258 --> 43:35.959
Say my name.
Sam Wheat. Say it!

43:35.959 --> 43:38.060
Talk to me, Oda Mae.
Say something.

43:38.060 --> 43:40.059
Sam Wheat!

43:42.259 --> 43:43.659
Jesus!..

43:43.659 --> 43:45.060
Sam Wheat?

43:45.060 --> 43:47.160
God, I swear, no more
cheating. I promise.

43:47.560 --> 43:49.359
I'll do anything.
Give me penis.

43:49.359 --> 43:50.559
Just make that
guy go away.

43:50.559 --> 43:52.059
No way.

44:00.258 --> 44:02.159
It's OK.

44:03.159 --> 44:05.159
It's OK.

44:06.358 --> 44:08.258
All right, sister?

44:08.458 --> 44:09.459
Thank you.

44:09.459 --> 44:11.460
Yeah, you're all right.

44:11.460 --> 44:12.760
My mother had it

44:12.760 --> 44:15.159
and my mother's mother had it.
They both had the gift.

44:15.359 --> 44:16.759
And they always
said I had it

44:16.759 --> 44:19.859
but I never did,
I never had it.

44:19.859 --> 44:20.659
You know...

44:20.659 --> 44:22.559
They told me what it was like,
they told me all about it

44:22.559 --> 44:25.659
but now that I've got it,
I don't think I want it.

44:25.759 --> 44:28.458
Just give me a favour. Just go away.
Find somebody else.

44:28.458 --> 44:29.858
Somebody else?
You're out of your mind.

44:29.858 --> 44:31.558
Yeah, I'm getting there fast!

44:31.558 --> 44:33.758
I think she hit her head
harder, than we think.

44:33.758 --> 44:36.658
She was talking to nobody that wasn't
there before she had been hit her head.

44:36.658 --> 44:38.758
Well, I know she is, but
you know sister can do that.

44:38.758 --> 44:42.257
- Where exactly are you?
- I'm standing right beside you.

44:42.957 --> 44:45.157
You're standing
right beside me?

44:45.257 --> 44:47.258
Honey, we're right here!

44:47.258 --> 44:48.859
Are you white?

44:48.959 --> 44:49.859
What?

44:49.859 --> 44:52.058
- White?
- You're white, aren't you?

44:52.058 --> 44:53.558
You know what I think?

44:53.558 --> 44:55.358
Yeas, I'm calling the doctor.

44:55.358 --> 44:57.859
I knew it, it's a white guy!
Why me?

44:57.859 --> 45:00.658
Listen, damn it.
You're going to help me.

45:00.758 --> 45:02.658
There's a woman,
her name is Molly Jensen

45:02.658 --> 45:04.658
and she is in
terrible danger.

45:04.658 --> 45:06.958
The man who killed me
broke into our apartment

45:06.958 --> 45:08.358
and he is going to go back.

45:08.358 --> 45:10.157
So you've got to warn her.

45:10.157 --> 45:12.358
Just what makes you think
she's gonna listen to me?

45:12.358 --> 45:15.358
It's just a phone call.

45:16.858 --> 45:18.357
Look...

45:20.758 --> 45:22.859
you're all I've got.

45:22.859 --> 45:25.559
Now I'm not leaving
until you help me.

45:26.359 --> 45:28.758
I don't care how long it takes

45:28.758 --> 45:31.258
cause I can talk forever.

45:44.358 --> 45:47.258
- Hello.
- Hi, is this Molly Jensen?

45:47.558 --> 45:48.758
Yes.

45:48.758 --> 45:52.358
My name is Oda Mae Brown,
I'm a spiritual reader and advisor.

45:52.458 --> 45:54.957
And a friend of yours
gave me message for you.

45:55.057 --> 45:57.557
I know it sounds a
little crazy, but it's not.

45:57.557 --> 46:00.559
You've got to believe me.
Just don't be afraid.

46:01.059 --> 46:02.658
Who is this?

46:02.658 --> 46:04.558
I've got a message from Sam.

46:06.858 --> 46:07.659
What?

46:07.759 --> 46:09.859
Sam Wheat?
He asked me to call.

46:13.158 --> 46:15.258
- I told you!
- You've got to go there.

46:15.358 --> 46:16.958
Forget it!
I'm not going anywhere.

46:16.958 --> 46:18.658
I don't care what you do.

46:19.058 --> 46:21.557
Second verse,
same as the first.

46:21.657 --> 46:23.858
I'm Henry the Eighth, I am

46:24.258 --> 46:26.158
Henry the Eighth I am, I am

46:26.558 --> 46:29.057
I got married to the
widow next door

46:29.157 --> 46:31.558
she's been married
seven times before

46:31.858 --> 46:33.859
and everyone
was an Henry

46:33.859 --> 46:34.759
Henry!

46:34.759 --> 46:36.159
She wouldn't have
a Willy or a Sam

46:36.159 --> 46:37.159
No Sam!

46:37.159 --> 46:39.458
I'm her eighth old man,
I'm Henry

46:39.658 --> 46:42.058
Henry the Eighth I am, I am

46:42.358 --> 46:44.458
Henry the Eighth I am.

46:44.858 --> 46:47.057
Second verse,
same as the first

46:47.358 --> 46:49.758
I'm Henry the Eighth, I am

46:49.858 --> 46:52.257
Henry the Eighth I am, I am

46:52.457 --> 46:54.957
I got married to the
widow next door

46:55.057 --> 46:56.857
All right! All right!
Stop singing.

46:56.957 --> 46:59.457
I'll go anywhere you want to,
just don't sing any more.

47:05.356 --> 47:07.156
I can't believe this.

47:07.756 --> 47:09.257
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

47:09.257 --> 47:10.357
What am I doing
in downtown?

47:10.357 --> 47:12.958
I never come downtown.
I hate downtown!

47:13.058 --> 47:15.257
She's probably
not even there.

47:15.457 --> 47:16.957
Where are you?

47:19.658 --> 47:21.358
Which building is it?

47:23.357 --> 47:25.157
Switch 3.

47:26.657 --> 47:27.755
See, nobody's there.

47:27.755 --> 47:28.955
She is there,
just wait.

47:28.955 --> 47:31.155
I came down here, I did everything
I said I was gonna do.

47:31.155 --> 47:32.254
I pressed the button,
she's not there.

47:32.354 --> 47:34.354
- I'm going, good bye.
- Just wait one m...
- I'm sorry.

47:34.354 --> 47:35.555
Ninety-nine bottles
of beer on the wall

47:35.555 --> 47:36.955
ninety nine
bottles of beer

47:36.955 --> 47:37.955
Take one down,
pass it around

47:38.055 --> 47:40.155
Don't sing, all right, all right.

47:41.854 --> 47:43.155
<i>Hello?</i>

47:43.155 --> 47:44.555
Sh... She can't hear you.

47:44.555 --> 47:46.356
Hi, I'm Oda Mae

47:46.356 --> 47:48.456
you know, I called you last night
about your friend, Sam Wheat?

47:50.755 --> 47:52.455
I told you!

47:58.855 --> 48:01.455
Hey, Molly!
Molly Jensen.

48:01.455 --> 48:03.255
I know you're up there.
I know you hear me.

48:03.255 --> 48:05.355
I'm down here.
Sam wants to talk to you.

48:05.355 --> 48:07.455
This is for real!

48:07.955 --> 48:10.755
Hey, you remember the starfish
at Montego Bay?

48:11.055 --> 48:13.555
How would I know that
if he was'nt here?

48:14.455 --> 48:16.754
Hey Molly, I know about
the green underwear

48:16.754 --> 48:18.154
that you wrote
your name on.

48:18.254 --> 48:20.154
I won't forget that,
I tell you that.

48:20.955 --> 48:23.256
I know about the
picture in Reno.

48:24.256 --> 48:26.055
Hey, Molly!

48:27.955 --> 48:29.555
The sweater she knitted

48:29.555 --> 48:31.656
in the closet, that's too big.

48:31.856 --> 48:35.455
He just asked to remind you
of the sweater that's in the closet

48:35.455 --> 48:37.555
that you knitted
that's too big.

48:37.955 --> 48:40.055
Four sizes.

48:42.555 --> 48:44.054
Hey, hear me
talking to you?

48:44.054 --> 48:45.054
I hear you.

48:45.054 --> 48:46.555
Oh, shut up,
nobody's talking to you.

48:46.555 --> 48:48.255
Did you ever hear
of a phone?

48:48.355 --> 48:50.355
Want to kiss my butt?

48:50.855 --> 48:52.454
I'm not gonna stay
down here all day.

48:52.454 --> 48:53.454
Thank God!

48:53.454 --> 48:55.055
Oh man, shut up!

48:55.955 --> 48:57.756
Molly!

48:57.956 --> 49:00.056
I'm going to count to three,
and then I'm out of here.

49:00.456 --> 49:02.455
One-two-three!

49:03.155 --> 49:05.155
- No Oda, wait.
- No.

49:05.955 --> 49:07.755
It's Molly.

49:14.254 --> 49:16.154
Molly?

49:18.654 --> 49:20.654
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

49:25.454 --> 49:26.354
I don't know you

49:26.354 --> 49:27.454
I don't know
this guy Sam

49:27.454 --> 49:28.853
but let me tell you
what he did to me.

49:28.853 --> 49:30.053
He kept me up all
night singing

49:30.053 --> 49:31.953
"I'm Henry the Eighth, I am."

49:33.354 --> 49:35.655
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

49:36.954 --> 49:39.854
Look, I'm sorry.
I just...

49:39.854 --> 49:42.955
Just don't believe in this
life after death stuff.

49:43.555 --> 49:44.855
Tell her she's wrong.

49:44.855 --> 49:47.054
He says you're wrong.

49:47.554 --> 49:49.254
You're talking
to him right now?

49:49.354 --> 49:52.154
Yeah. He just asked me to
tell you that you're wrong.

49:53.054 --> 49:54.653
So where is he?

49:54.653 --> 49:57.153
I can't see him,
I can only hear him.

49:58.554 --> 50:00.454
I'm right here.

50:00.454 --> 50:02.454
That doesn't help, Sam.

50:03.753 --> 50:05.653
I'm holding her hand.

50:06.054 --> 50:08.155
He says he's
holding your hand.

50:18.054 --> 50:19.954
What are you doing?

50:21.054 --> 50:22.954
What do you think
you're doing to me?

50:22.954 --> 50:26.354
Hey look, if you think I came over down
here for my health, you're out of your mind.

50:26.354 --> 50:29.354
Sam's dead, OK?
He's dead.

50:30.055 --> 50:31.154
Tell her I love her.

50:31.154 --> 50:33.054
He says he loves you.

50:35.254 --> 50:37.254
Sam would never say that.

50:37.554 --> 50:38.554
"Ditto", tell her "ditto"!

50:38.554 --> 50:40.053
What is "ditto"?

50:40.153 --> 50:42.053
Ditto!

51:11.554 --> 51:12.654
To tell you the truth

51:12.654 --> 51:14.753
I don't know
how I'm doing this.

51:14.853 --> 51:18.254
Confidentially - nothing like this
has ever happened to me before.

51:18.354 --> 51:20.155
I mean nothing.

51:20.355 --> 51:22.455
Now I can't
turn it off.

51:24.454 --> 51:26.154
Is this him?
ls this you?

51:26.154 --> 51:27.854
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

51:27.954 --> 51:29.254
Cute.

51:29.254 --> 51:31.254
White, but cute.

51:31.554 --> 51:33.254
What I don't
understand is

51:33.254 --> 51:34.754
why did he come back?

51:34.754 --> 51:37.653
- I don't know.
- ...why is he still here?

51:38.053 --> 51:39.853
He's stuck, that's what it is.

51:39.853 --> 51:41.354
He's in between worlds.

51:41.354 --> 51:43.253
You know, it happens
sometimes that

51:43.353 --> 51:44.953
the spirit gets yanked
out so quick

51:45.053 --> 51:46.453
that the essence still feels

51:46.453 --> 51:48.353
like it has work to do.

51:48.353 --> 51:49.953
Would you stop rambling?

51:49.953 --> 51:52.252
I don't think I'm rambling,
I'm just answering her question.

51:52.352 --> 51:53.552
He's got an attitude now.

51:53.552 --> 51:55.053
I don't have
an attitude.

51:55.053 --> 51:56.753
Yes, you do
have an attitude.

51:56.753 --> 51:58.154
We're having a
little discussion.

51:58.154 --> 52:00.053
If you didn't have
an attitude

52:00.053 --> 52:02.153
you wouldn't have raised your
voice to me now, would you?

52:02.253 --> 52:04.153
- Goddammit, Oda Mae...
- Don't you goddammit me!

52:04.153 --> 52:06.154
Don't you take the
Lord's name in vain.

52:06.154 --> 52:07.954
- You understand?
- Would you relax?

52:07.954 --> 52:09.553
No, you relax!
You're the dead guy.

52:09.553 --> 52:12.053
You want me to help you?
You'd better apologise.

52:12.053 --> 52:14.153
- Curse!
- That's it, I'm leaving.

52:14.953 --> 52:17.452
Nobody talks to me like that.
You understand me?

52:18.152 --> 52:19.452
Now, you'd better apologise.

52:19.452 --> 52:20.652
I'm sorry.

52:20.652 --> 52:22.053
I apologise.

52:22.053 --> 52:23.553
OK?

52:23.553 --> 52:26.152
Now would you sit down?

52:26.452 --> 52:27.452
Please?

52:27.452 --> 52:29.453
He's apologised.

52:31.154 --> 52:32.954
I need you to tell
Molly what I'm saying

52:32.954 --> 52:34.954
but you have to
tell her word for word.

52:34.954 --> 52:37.253
All right?
Word for word.

52:37.553 --> 52:40.653
Yes. He wants me to
tell you what he's saying

52:40.653 --> 52:42.753
word for word.

52:48.053 --> 52:49.353
Molly, you're in danger.

52:49.353 --> 52:51.153
You can't just
blurt it out like that!

52:51.153 --> 52:52.554
And quit moving around

52:52.554 --> 52:53.653
you're start to make me dizzy.

52:53.653 --> 52:55.753
I'll just tell her
in my own way.

52:56.853 --> 52:58.453
Molly

52:58.453 --> 53:00.753
you're in danger, girl.

53:02.152 --> 53:03.652
What are you talking about?

53:03.752 --> 53:05.152
I know the
man who killed me.

53:05.152 --> 53:06.353
He knows the
man who killed him.

53:06.353 --> 53:09.254
His name is Willie Lopez,
and I know where he lives.

53:09.354 --> 53:11.353
His name is Willie Lopez,
he is Puerto-Rican.

53:11.353 --> 53:13.153
- He knows where he lives.
- Write it down.

53:13.153 --> 53:14.153
He wants you
to write it down.

53:14.153 --> 53:16.454
- You write it down.
- I ain't no damned secretary!

53:16.454 --> 53:18.254
Just do it!

53:20.653 --> 53:22.353
He is so testy!

53:23.353 --> 53:24.451
What is it you
want me to write?

53:24.451 --> 53:27.951
303, Prospect Place, apt. 4D.

53:27.951 --> 53:29.950
303 Prospect Place?

53:29.950 --> 53:31.650
Yes.

53:31.750 --> 53:32.951
It's my neighbourhood.

53:32.951 --> 53:34.951
Molly, he's got my wallet

53:35.151 --> 53:36.351
he's got my key

53:36.351 --> 53:38.150
and he was in here.

53:38.250 --> 53:40.251
he's got his wallet, and his key
and he was in here.

53:40.251 --> 53:41.951
Yesterday, when you came
back from your walk with Carl

53:41.951 --> 53:44.352
you went upstairs,
you talked to Floyd...

53:44.352 --> 53:45.452
All right, all right, all right.

53:45.452 --> 53:48.251
When you came in yesterday from
your walk with Carl, he was here.

53:48.251 --> 53:50.651
You checked your clothes
off, he saw everything.

53:50.651 --> 53:53.751
Molly, you got to go to the police.
It was a set-up.

53:53.751 --> 53:56.051
I was murdered.

53:56.651 --> 53:59.651
He wants you to go the police.
He said it was a set-up, he was murdered.

53:59.651 --> 54:00.650
Somebody else is involved...

54:00.750 --> 54:03.951
- I don't know who, but...
- Forget it. I don't want no more to do with this, OK.

54:03.951 --> 54:05.050
Wait.

54:05.150 --> 54:07.750
- Where are you going?
- What do you mean "where am I going"? I'm leaving.

54:07.750 --> 54:10.250
I did everything I said I was gonna do.
And don't be following me

54:10.250 --> 54:11.850
cause I'm finished.
And I mean it!

54:11.850 --> 54:13.749
Have a nice life,
have a nice death.

54:13.849 --> 54:15.549
Goodbye.

54:18.850 --> 54:21.051
Molly, there's no one
on earth besides you

54:21.251 --> 54:24.350
who'd want this to be
true more than me. But...

54:24.450 --> 54:26.650
You've got to be
rational about this.

54:26.750 --> 54:29.651
Sam is no more
in this room than...

54:30.551 --> 54:32.550
Look...

54:32.650 --> 54:35.550
I understand the
need to hang on to him

54:35.550 --> 54:37.150
I really do.

54:37.150 --> 54:38.550
But this is absurd!

54:38.550 --> 54:42.449
I know this seems absurd,
but it had to be real.

54:42.449 --> 54:44.650
How could you believe some
fortune-teller from Brooklyn

54:44.750 --> 54:46.450
who just shows
up at your door?

54:46.450 --> 54:49.649
I watched them
have a conversation.

54:49.749 --> 54:52.350
I don't buy it, Moll.
Not for a minute.

54:52.450 --> 54:54.551
What about the
things she knew?

54:54.951 --> 54:56.251
What things?

54:56.451 --> 54:59.850
The photo that Sam took
of me on our trip to Reno.

54:59.850 --> 55:01.850
Carl, we were alone.

55:02.250 --> 55:05.350
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

55:08.750 --> 55:11.050
She said Sam knew who killed him.

55:12.750 --> 55:14.550
That he was set up.

55:14.550 --> 55:17.850
This is getting deranged.
We're going off the deep end here.

55:17.850 --> 55:19.950
- She had a name and an address.
- Good, Molly, good...

55:19.950 --> 55:24.050
Willie Lopez, 303
Prospect Place, apt. 4D.

55:25.649 --> 55:27.149
This is sick.

55:27.149 --> 55:28.349
Oh, Carl.

55:28.349 --> 55:30.250
This is really sick.

55:33.451 --> 55:34.650
Molly, I don't understand

55:34.650 --> 55:37.850
how you could...
could...

55:38.850 --> 55:41.351
swallow this crap.
I mean...

55:41.551 --> 55:44.150
This guy may not even exist.
This woman...

55:44.550 --> 55:45.750
Maybe she's just
trying to use you

55:45.750 --> 55:47.750
to set someone up.

55:48.950 --> 55:50.850
You're right.

55:51.050 --> 55:53.149
You're absolutely right.

55:53.749 --> 55:55.650
That's what I've
got to find out.

55:55.750 --> 55:58.150
What do you mean "find out"?
How are you gonna do that?

55:58.250 --> 56:00.649
She said Sam wants
me to go to the police.

56:00.649 --> 56:03.650
Sam wants you
to go to the police?

56:03.650 --> 56:05.751
Jesus, Moll!..

56:05.851 --> 56:07.051
Are you out of your mi...
I mean

56:07.051 --> 56:08.651
what are you gonna tell the police?
You gonna tell them

56:08.751 --> 56:11.450
that some storefront
psychic lady has been

56:11.850 --> 56:13.150
communing with the dead?

56:13.150 --> 56:14.450
Do you have any idea
how that sounds?

56:14.450 --> 56:17.750
You're talking ghosts here,
for Christ's sake.

56:19.650 --> 56:21.250
I'm sorry.

56:21.250 --> 56:23.949
This stuff just really
gets to me, you know.

56:24.049 --> 56:26.149
It's OK if you
don't believe me.

56:26.349 --> 56:28.649
I'm trying to, Molly.

56:32.349 --> 56:34.049
Look.

56:35.949 --> 56:37.548
If it'll make you
feel any better

56:37.748 --> 56:40.749
I'll go check this out, OK?

56:40.749 --> 56:42.950
I want you to try
and get some sleep.

56:44.150 --> 56:46.249
OK?

56:48.249 --> 56:49.349
I'll call you in the morning.

56:49.349 --> 56:51.550
- OK.
- All right. Goodnight.

57:18.750 --> 57:20.750
Be careful.

57:34.149 --> 57:35.649
Carl!

57:35.649 --> 57:37.649
What the hell are
you doing here?

57:39.949 --> 57:42.249
Who have you
been talking to, Willie?

57:42.249 --> 57:44.149
Talking to?
What the hell do you mean?

57:44.149 --> 57:45.549
Some woman
knows all about you.

57:45.549 --> 57:47.149
Everything.

57:47.149 --> 57:48.748
Where's she
getting it from?

57:48.748 --> 57:50.048
I haven't said
a word to anybody.

57:50.048 --> 57:53.049
She knows your name, goddammit.
She knows where you live.

57:53.049 --> 57:54.650
How do women
know where I live?

57:54.650 --> 57:56.250
This is not a joke!

57:56.250 --> 57:58.549
She knows about
the murder.

57:59.949 --> 58:01.749
Now, I want you
to find this bitch

58:01.749 --> 58:03.650
whoever she is

58:03.650 --> 58:05.749
and I want you to...

58:07.449 --> 58:09.949
Just get rid of her, OK?

58:10.549 --> 58:11.949
I've got 4 million dollars

58:11.949 --> 58:14.748
stuffed in a goddamn computer.

58:15.848 --> 58:17.448
If I don't get those codes

58:17.448 --> 58:19.749
if that money is not
transferred soon...

58:22.649 --> 58:24.248
l'm...

58:24.348 --> 58:25.448
dead.

58:25.448 --> 58:26.549
We're both dead.

58:26.549 --> 58:28.750
Why don't you tell them
you only launder money

58:28.750 --> 58:30.250
on the first of the month.

58:30.250 --> 58:32.749
What the hell is
wrong with you?

58:32.749 --> 58:35.049
ls everything a joke?

58:35.149 --> 58:36.349
You killed a man.

58:36.349 --> 58:38.649
You were supposed to steal
his wallet, was that joke?

58:38.749 --> 58:40.449
I did you a favour, man.

58:40.449 --> 58:42.349
That was a freebie.

58:43.049 --> 58:46.848
Look, these are
drug dealers, OK?

58:47.448 --> 58:49.248
Just don't blow
this for me, Willie.

58:49.248 --> 58:51.848
I'd lose my job, I'd go to jail.

58:52.448 --> 58:55.448
$80,000 of that money is mine.

58:58.148 --> 59:00.347
Look, just...

59:00.947 --> 59:02.347
Let me have the keys
to Sam's apartment

59:02.347 --> 59:05.749
I'll get the address
book myself, OK?

59:31.446 --> 59:33.546
You goddamn bastard!

59:33.546 --> 59:34.746
Why?

59:34.746 --> 59:37.746
Why?
You were my friend!

59:39.647 --> 59:42.047
I had a life, goddamn you!

59:42.347 --> 59:44.946
I had a life.

59:52.446 --> 59:55.446
Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

59:56.046 --> 59:58.446
But she was real.

59:58.846 --> 01:00:01.746
Do you think I'd come here
if it wasn't real?

01:00:03.646 --> 01:00:07.146
You told me if I had any new
information, that I should come.

01:00:08.346 --> 01:00:10.645
So, here I am.

01:00:14.345 --> 01:00:15.646
I know how this sounds.

01:00:15.646 --> 01:00:17.547
I mean, I hear
myself saying it

01:00:17.547 --> 01:00:20.146
and I wanna cringe.

01:00:20.446 --> 01:00:23.246
But this woman knew
things she couldn't have known.

01:00:23.646 --> 01:00:25.747
Things Sam only said to me.

01:00:25.847 --> 01:00:26.747
OK.

01:00:26.747 --> 01:00:29.346
According to this psychic lady

01:00:29.346 --> 01:00:33.046
there are ghosts and
spirits all over the place?

01:00:33.546 --> 01:00:36.146
Watching us all the time?

01:00:39.045 --> 01:00:41.946
Hell, I'm never going
to get undressed again.

01:00:42.746 --> 01:00:43.846
Excuse me.

01:00:43.846 --> 01:00:46.645
I've got more
important things to do.

01:00:57.346 --> 01:00:59.246
The guy's name is Willie Lopez.

01:00:59.546 --> 01:01:02.746
All I'm asking is for
you to check it out.

01:01:03.046 --> 01:01:05.346
OK. You just wait here

01:01:05.346 --> 01:01:08.845
and let me see if the
guy's got a record. All right?

01:01:08.845 --> 01:01:11.445
Right.

01:02:12.345 --> 01:02:14.445
What are you doing?

01:02:14.445 --> 01:02:17.545
- Where's the file on Willie Lopez?
- There's no file for Willie Lopez.

01:02:17.645 --> 01:02:19.345
He was probably
some old boyfriend

01:02:19.345 --> 01:02:21.845
she was trying
to get even with.

01:02:22.145 --> 01:02:26.145
And this psychic woman's got
a record that goes back a long way.

01:02:26.345 --> 01:02:29.445
1967, Shreveport.

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.545
Forgery

01:02:30.545 --> 01:02:33.045
selling of false ID.

01:02:33.045 --> 01:02:35.744
Served one year in 1971.

01:02:35.944 --> 01:02:39.846
Baton Rouge. Arrested for
fraud, numbers racketeering.

01:02:39.846 --> 01:02:42.845
served ten months, 1974.

01:02:42.945 --> 01:02:44.845
Look, this is impossible!

01:02:45.245 --> 01:02:47.045
It goes on and on.

01:02:47.045 --> 01:02:50.046
She knew things -
private things.

01:02:50.146 --> 01:02:51.645
Now how could she
have known all that?

01:02:51.645 --> 01:02:53.545
A lot of times
they read the obits.

01:02:53.845 --> 01:02:57.445
All she had to do was see
the word "banker." Boom.

01:02:57.545 --> 01:03:00.444
They even go
through your garbage

01:03:00.444 --> 01:03:01.944
to find things they can use.

01:03:02.044 --> 01:03:03.845
Letters, old papers.

01:03:03.945 --> 01:03:05.845
It doesn't take much.

01:03:05.945 --> 01:03:07.945
No.

01:03:09.244 --> 01:03:11.945
It was real.

01:03:13.545 --> 01:03:18.445
She knew about
a sweater I knitted.

01:03:18.645 --> 01:03:21.145
And songs we sang.

01:03:25.745 --> 01:03:28.545
The trip to Montego Bay.

01:03:30.245 --> 01:03:31.544
I'm sorry.

01:03:31.544 --> 01:03:33.844
I know this is hard.

01:03:34.044 --> 01:03:35.845
People want so
much to believe.

01:03:35.845 --> 01:03:37.344
They're grieving

01:03:37.344 --> 01:03:39.344
they're vulnerable...

01:03:39.944 --> 01:03:42.244
And they will
give anything

01:03:42.344 --> 01:03:44.144
for one last moment.

01:03:44.144 --> 01:03:45.643
Believe me

01:03:45.643 --> 01:03:48.143
these people know
what they're doing.

01:03:48.643 --> 01:03:50.444
I know how you must feel

01:03:50.444 --> 01:03:53.645
but you know you
can press charges.

01:03:57.544 --> 01:03:59.345
No.

01:04:02.345 --> 01:04:04.244
Thank you.

01:04:18.144 --> 01:04:20.544
God, let this be it.

01:04:30.444 --> 01:04:32.144
Yeah.

01:04:32.944 --> 01:04:34.844
Yes.

01:04:46.544 --> 01:04:47.644
Hello.

01:04:47.644 --> 01:04:49.344
Eddie?
It's Carl Bruner.

01:04:49.344 --> 01:04:50.644
- What's up?
- We're fine.

01:04:50.644 --> 01:04:52.144
Everything's fine.
Just we're all set.

01:04:52.144 --> 01:04:54.744
- Good.
- Just let me know what you want me to do.

01:04:55.044 --> 01:04:57.843
I want you to transfer the money
from the 12 separate accounts

01:04:57.843 --> 01:05:01.044
into a single account
under the name "Rita Miller. "

01:05:01.044 --> 01:05:02.344
OK.

01:05:02.344 --> 01:05:04.345
Tomorrow, at five
minutes before closing

01:05:04.345 --> 01:05:06.044
3.55 pm

01:05:06.044 --> 01:05:09.944
transfer the full account to
the First lsland Bank of Nassau

01:05:09.944 --> 01:05:13.445
registry number
486-9580.

01:05:13.745 --> 01:05:15.644
Call us when it's done.

01:05:15.844 --> 01:05:17.644
OK, I've got it.

01:05:18.244 --> 01:05:20.242
Just tell Mr Balistrari

01:05:20.242 --> 01:05:22.242
that there won't be
any more problems, OK.

01:05:22.242 --> 01:05:23.541
- Yeah, I'll do that.
- Thank you.

01:05:23.641 --> 01:05:25.641
Good work, Carl.

01:06:24.942 --> 01:06:27.141
Molly, why can't
you hear me?

01:06:27.941 --> 01:06:30.141
I need you.

01:06:41.441 --> 01:06:42.541
Who is it?

01:06:42.541 --> 01:06:44.440
It's Carl, Molly.

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.540
No.

01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.041
Don't open the
goddamn door!

01:06:47.041 --> 01:06:48.342
- He's a murderer.
- Hi.

01:06:48.342 --> 01:06:50.842
- Hey.
- Listen, sorry, I know it's late.

01:06:50.842 --> 01:06:53.541
I'm sorry to disturb you.
I just...

01:06:53.741 --> 01:06:55.541
I've been thinking
about you all day.

01:06:55.541 --> 01:06:59.341
And I feel really
lousy about last night.

01:06:59.541 --> 01:07:00.941
This supernatural thing...

01:07:01.041 --> 01:07:03.541
Listen, don't worry
about it, really. It's OK.

01:07:03.541 --> 01:07:04.541
No, it's not.

01:07:04.541 --> 01:07:07.441
You needed me to
hear you, and I didn't.

01:07:07.441 --> 01:07:09.541
I wasn't there for
you and that was...

01:07:10.241 --> 01:07:12.141
That was wrong.

01:07:12.341 --> 01:07:14.341
It's just... I...

01:07:15.041 --> 01:07:16.641
I just...

01:07:16.641 --> 01:07:19.640
I want you to know
that I'm your friend, Moll.

01:07:20.640 --> 01:07:21.640
Thanks, Carl.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:23.040
You were never her friend.

01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.741
That really means
a lot to me.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:25.942
Me too.

01:07:25.942 --> 01:07:28.141
So I've brought you some
Japanese apple pears.

01:07:28.141 --> 01:07:30.141
I know you like them.

01:07:31.941 --> 01:07:34.342
Thanks, that's very sweet.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:36.442
Could I come in for a second?

01:07:36.642 --> 01:07:38.841
I won't stay long.
it's just been one of those days.

01:07:38.941 --> 01:07:40.241
Maybe a cup of coffee?

01:07:40.241 --> 01:07:41.741
Yeah, come on in.

01:07:41.741 --> 01:07:43.841
No, Molly.

01:07:43.841 --> 01:07:45.841
You seem a little tense.

01:07:45.841 --> 01:07:46.840
Are you OK?

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.840
No, I'm fine. It's just...

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:51.241
What can I tell you?
It's been tough.

01:07:51.241 --> 01:07:53.141
You know.

01:07:53.141 --> 01:07:54.741
It just still hurts so much.

01:07:54.841 --> 01:07:56.740
You lying snake.

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.742
And then on top of it,
there's stuff at work.

01:07:59.842 --> 01:08:01.842
They've given me my
own accounts, which is...

01:08:02.042 --> 01:08:03.642
wich is good, but I...

01:08:03.642 --> 01:08:06.841
I just haven't really
had time to adjust.

01:08:07.741 --> 01:08:09.941
To absorb everything.

01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:15.241
It's no big deal.

01:08:26.540 --> 01:08:28.439
Can I have a
little more cream?

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.340
Yeah.

01:08:31.339 --> 01:08:32.538
Oh, shit!

01:08:32.538 --> 01:08:35.038
Jesus, I can't believe
I did that.

01:08:35.038 --> 01:08:37.341
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:08:38.841 --> 01:08:39.939
Ah, God.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:41.439
Let me throw
that in the washer.

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:44.140
Don't worry about it.
It's OK.

01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.041
Do you want me to
give you another shirt?

01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:48.241
No, it'll dry,
just take a minute.

01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:57.639
So where were you today? I thought
you were gonna come into the bank

01:08:57.639 --> 01:08:59.639
and sign those papers?

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:02.240
Well, I was supposed to,
but I didn't have time.

01:09:03.439 --> 01:09:05.340
I went to the police.

01:09:12.041 --> 01:09:13.640
You did?

01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:15.041
Wow. What did you tell them?

01:09:15.041 --> 01:09:16.540
What did they say?

01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:18.840
It was awful.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:21.140
I felt really stupid.

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:24.639
They brought out
a file on this woman

01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:27.040
at least ten inches thick.

01:09:27.740 --> 01:09:29.439
Rip-off artist, huh?

01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:31.640
No, Molly.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:35.140
You know, the sad thing

01:09:36.540 --> 01:09:38.540
is that I believed her.

01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:40.439
Molly

01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:43.639
Sometimes we
need to believe.

01:09:44.939 --> 01:09:46.840
Why? What's the point?

01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:49.441
It is not easy to face
the realities of life.

01:09:49.441 --> 01:09:52.040
Sometimes you've got
to give yourself that.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.440
But you've got to
remember the love you guys felt.

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.741
That's what real.

01:09:56.741 --> 01:10:00.440
You've got to remember how good
Sam was, how much he loved you.

01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:02.240
You were everything
to him, Molly.

01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:04.540
You were his life.

01:10:18.339 --> 01:10:20.240
I feel so alone.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:29.840
You're not alone.

01:10:29.840 --> 01:10:31.940
OK?

01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:34.140
You've got your work,
you're incredibly talented.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.939
You're young.

01:10:36.039 --> 01:10:38.140
Fantastically gorgeous.

01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:42.139
I don't know what's
real anymore.

01:10:43.439 --> 01:10:45.539
I don't know what to think.

01:10:48.939 --> 01:10:51.339
Just think about Sam.

01:10:53.439 --> 01:10:56.038
Think about the time you
two guys had together.

01:10:57.238 --> 01:10:59.639
How wonderful that was.

01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:02.439
Yeah.

01:11:02.539 --> 01:11:05.739
Let your feelings out,
Molly, it's OK.

01:11:05.839 --> 01:11:08.240
Life turns on a dime.

01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:12.239
You know?

01:11:12.539 --> 01:11:14.539
I mean...

01:11:14.739 --> 01:11:16.537
people think that...

01:11:17.137 --> 01:11:19.337
that they're forever,
that there is always tomorrow

01:11:19.337 --> 01:11:20.936
but that's bullshit.

01:11:20.936 --> 01:11:23.837
Sam taught us that.

01:11:24.437 --> 01:11:26.937
We have to live for now.

01:11:29.436 --> 01:11:31.536
For today.

01:11:50.637 --> 01:11:52.637
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:11:52.737 --> 01:11:53.637
It's OK.

01:11:53.637 --> 01:11:55.437
I can't, it's
just too soon.

01:11:55.437 --> 01:11:57.337
It's OK.

01:11:57.637 --> 01:11:59.637
You've been great, Carl.

01:12:02.137 --> 01:12:03.437
But I need you to leave.

01:12:03.437 --> 01:12:05.636
It's OK, I understand.

01:12:05.636 --> 01:12:07.536
Please.

01:12:13.038 --> 01:12:14.837
Could we just have
dinner tomorrow night?

01:12:14.837 --> 01:12:17.337
Just talk.
Can I interest you in that?

01:12:19.438 --> 01:12:20.338
Yeah.

01:12:20.338 --> 01:12:23.037
- Sure.
- Great.

01:13:31.137 --> 01:13:32.237
Hey!

01:13:36.236 --> 01:13:38.536
Get off my train!

01:13:38.836 --> 01:13:39.636
No.

01:13:40.136 --> 01:13:41.436
Get off!

01:13:42.036 --> 01:13:44.535
Get off! Get off!

01:13:44.635 --> 01:13:45.935
Get off!

01:13:46.035 --> 01:13:48.036
Get out of here!

01:13:48.136 --> 01:13:49.936
- Get off!
- No.

01:13:49.936 --> 01:13:51.536
Show me
how you do that.

01:13:51.536 --> 01:13:53.335
I want to learn and
I'm not leaving till you teach me.

01:13:53.335 --> 01:13:55.136
Get off!

01:13:55.536 --> 01:13:58.037
- No.
- Get off!

01:14:04.836 --> 01:14:06.736
You stubborn asshole.

01:14:09.935 --> 01:14:12.536
What are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:13.936 --> 01:14:15.936
You're trying to move
it with your fingers.

01:14:16.036 --> 01:14:18.537
You can't push it with your finger.
You're dead.

01:14:27.036 --> 01:14:28.835
It's all in your mind.

01:14:29.735 --> 01:14:32.336
The problem with you
is you still think you're real.

01:14:32.636 --> 01:14:34.537
You think you're
wearing those clothes?

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:36.736
You think you
crouch on that floor?

01:14:36.936 --> 01:14:38.336
Bullshit!

01:14:38.336 --> 01:14:40.336
You ain't got
a body no more, son!

01:14:40.336 --> 01:14:41.736
It's all up here now.

01:14:41.836 --> 01:14:43.037
You want to move something

01:14:43.037 --> 01:14:45.037
you've got to move
it with your mind.

01:14:45.037 --> 01:14:47.336
You've got to focus!
Do you hear what I'm saying?

01:14:47.436 --> 01:14:49.236
How? How do you focus?

01:14:49.336 --> 01:14:51.736
I don't know
how you focus.

01:14:51.836 --> 01:14:54.036
You just focus.

01:14:57.635 --> 01:15:00.436
- How did you do that?
- You've got to take all of your emotions...

01:15:00.436 --> 01:15:02.936
all your anger, all
your love, all your hate

01:15:02.936 --> 01:15:04.935
And push it, way down here

01:15:04.935 --> 01:15:06.536
into the pit
of your stomach

01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:09.337
and then let it explode,
like a reactor.

01:15:11.937 --> 01:15:13.836
OK, OK.

01:15:19.236 --> 01:15:21.236
Don't laugh!

01:15:45.235 --> 01:15:47.136
Way to go, kid.

01:15:47.336 --> 01:15:49.035
I did it.

01:15:49.935 --> 01:15:51.535
I did it.

01:15:51.735 --> 01:15:53.736
Way to go.

01:16:00.135 --> 01:16:02.035
From your gut,
like I told you.

01:16:05.535 --> 01:16:08.634
Give it time.
What else have you got?

01:16:16.934 --> 01:16:18.935
How long have
you been here?

01:16:20.836 --> 01:16:23.036
Since they pushed me.

01:16:23.336 --> 01:16:24.435
Someone pushed you?

01:16:24.435 --> 01:16:26.435
Yes, someone pushed me.

01:16:26.435 --> 01:16:27.235
Who?

01:16:27.235 --> 01:16:28.935
What?
You don't believe me?

01:16:29.135 --> 01:16:31.835
You think I fell?
You think I jumped?

01:16:31.935 --> 01:16:33.435
Well, fuck you!

01:16:33.635 --> 01:16:35.335
It wasn't my time!

01:16:35.335 --> 01:16:37.235
I wasn't supposed to go!

01:16:37.235 --> 01:16:39.135
I'm not supposed
to be here.

01:16:49.135 --> 01:16:52.034
I'd give anything for a drag!

01:16:53.034 --> 01:16:55.335
Just one drag...

01:16:55.835 --> 01:16:57.336
Are you all right?

01:16:57.536 --> 01:17:00.135
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?

01:17:00.735 --> 01:17:02.735
Who sent you?

01:17:04.035 --> 01:17:06.136
Who sent you?

01:17:08.136 --> 01:17:09.635
Leave me alone!

01:17:09.635 --> 01:17:11.035
Leave me alone!

01:17:11.335 --> 01:17:13.433
Leave me alone!

01:17:56.332 --> 01:17:58.032
Yes!

01:18:13.232 --> 01:18:14.532
You need to concentrate.

01:18:14.532 --> 01:18:16.633
If you concentrate, you'll
probably rouse him.

01:18:16.633 --> 01:18:18.233
What's his name again?

01:18:18.233 --> 01:18:20.132
Orlando.

01:18:20.532 --> 01:18:22.632
Orlando, Orlando.

01:18:22.632 --> 01:18:24.132
Is there an Orlando here?

01:18:24.432 --> 01:18:25.832
- I'm here.
- He's here.

01:18:25.832 --> 01:18:27.932
- Oda Mae, I...
- Sam!

01:18:27.932 --> 01:18:29.231
Excuse me,
I'm Orlando.

01:18:29.231 --> 01:18:30.931
The line's over there.

01:18:30.931 --> 01:18:33.132
Oda Mae, where did
these ghosts come from?

01:18:33.132 --> 01:18:35.932
- You can hear them, too?
- Hear them? Can I hear them?

01:18:35.932 --> 01:18:39.431
I hear them in the morning, I hear them
in the evening. They come into the shower!

01:18:39.431 --> 01:18:43.133
Sam, what's the hell did you do to me?
Did you tell every spook in the world about me?

01:18:43.133 --> 01:18:45.433
I got spooks from
Jersey coming in here.

01:18:45.633 --> 01:18:48.332
There's stuff going on you wouldn't believe.
I don't even beleive it.

01:18:48.432 --> 01:18:49.732
It's amazing.
You're really doing it.

01:18:49.732 --> 01:18:51.232
Yes, I know.

01:18:51.232 --> 01:18:53.032
Can you please hurry this up?

01:18:53.032 --> 01:18:55.432
Oh, chill out!
Chill out.

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:57.332
Listen, I need your
help again, Oda Mae.

01:18:57.332 --> 01:18:58.432
There's something
we need to do. Just...

01:18:58.432 --> 01:19:00.832
No. I'm not doing
anything else with you, Sam.

01:19:00.832 --> 01:19:02.632
Look.
You're holding on to a life

01:19:02.632 --> 01:19:04.333
that doesn't
want you anymore.

01:19:04.333 --> 01:19:07.132
It doesn't want you.
Give up the ghost!

01:19:07.232 --> 01:19:09.232
Are you speaking to me?

01:19:09.232 --> 01:19:11.132
Does it look like
I'm speaking to you?

01:19:11.232 --> 01:19:14.331
You'll know when I'm talking to you.
You're supposed to be concentrating, aren't you?

01:19:14.431 --> 01:19:15.631
Are you gonna try it?

01:19:15.631 --> 01:19:17.031
Thank you very much.

01:19:17.031 --> 01:19:19.432
Sam, are you going to get out of here?
Couse I... I've got work to do!

01:19:19.932 --> 01:19:21.833
- Uh-uh.
- Fine, then stay there.

01:19:22.133 --> 01:19:23.932
Excuse me.

01:19:24.032 --> 01:19:25.432
Are you ready now?

01:19:26.032 --> 01:19:27.332
Let's do it.

01:19:27.332 --> 01:19:29.433
Oda Mae listen, I've
got to talk to you now.

01:19:29.433 --> 01:19:30.733
I've got a plan.

01:19:30.733 --> 01:19:33.332
You see, I figured this thing out,
there's something we can do...

01:19:35.132 --> 01:19:36.832
Oda Mae?

01:19:43.031 --> 01:19:44.732
Oda Mae.

01:19:46.532 --> 01:19:48.232
Ortisha?

01:19:49.531 --> 01:19:51.431
Orlando!
ls that you?

01:19:51.431 --> 01:19:54.033
Where are you at?
I can hardly see.

01:19:54.233 --> 01:19:56.033
Here! She's here!

01:19:56.133 --> 01:19:58.332
In front of you.
I'm right here!

01:20:02.832 --> 01:20:05.432
Damn, baby, what did
you do to your hair?

01:20:07.431 --> 01:20:09.132
Orlando, do you like it?

01:20:09.132 --> 01:20:11.332
It's Autumn Sunrise.

01:20:15.031 --> 01:20:17.631
Get out of me,
you son of a bitch!

01:20:21.031 --> 01:20:23.131
Don't you ever do
that to me again!

01:20:23.231 --> 01:20:24.931
Orlando?..

01:20:27.330 --> 01:20:28.630
I can barely move.

01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:30.631
Now you should
know better then that.

01:20:30.631 --> 01:20:32.732
Jumping into bodies
wipes you out.

01:20:32.932 --> 01:20:33.931
Everybody out!

01:20:34.131 --> 01:20:35.831
What happened to Orlando?

01:20:35.931 --> 01:20:37.931
Where is the insurance policy?

01:20:37.931 --> 01:20:39.331
Are you deaf?

01:20:39.331 --> 01:20:41.732
I said everybody out!

01:20:41.832 --> 01:20:43.031
Everybody out!

01:20:43.031 --> 01:20:44.231
Get out, get out!

01:20:44.231 --> 01:20:46.031
Everybody get out!

01:20:58.231 --> 01:20:59.631
Get out!

01:20:59.631 --> 01:21:01.130
Are you the fortune-teller?

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:02.530
Who are you?

01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:04.531
That's an interesting question.

01:21:05.832 --> 01:21:06.932
Why don't you tell me?

01:21:06.932 --> 01:21:08.132
Willie.

01:21:08.132 --> 01:21:09.532
Willie?

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:11.531
Prospect Place Willie?

01:21:11.631 --> 01:21:13.431
Get out of here fast!

01:21:25.431 --> 01:21:27.432
Sister! Oda Mae!
Sister!

01:21:29.331 --> 01:21:31.331
I'm all right.

01:21:33.831 --> 01:21:36.031
Oda Mae, we're in trouble.
So you've gotta help me.

01:21:36.031 --> 01:21:39.130
Who's we?
You're already dead.

01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:41.231
Don't you understand, these
people are trying to kill me!

01:21:41.331 --> 01:21:43.132
Yeah, you're right.
And they'll be back.

01:21:43.232 --> 01:21:46.131
Look. Why don't you
just find a house to haunt?

01:21:46.231 --> 01:21:48.231
You know, get some
chains and rattle them.

01:21:48.231 --> 01:21:50.932
Will you listen to me?
I have a plan and and it will work

01:21:51.032 --> 01:21:52.832
but you've got to get
some your fake IDs.

01:21:52.932 --> 01:21:54.232
Forget it.

01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:57.631
If you do this, they'll never
bother you again. I promise.

01:22:02.531 --> 01:22:04.530
Scout's honour.

01:22:05.530 --> 01:22:07.231
All right.

01:22:07.831 --> 01:22:10.831
What do I have to do?
What exactly do I have to do?

01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:14.931
Have you got a nice dress?

01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:19.332
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

01:22:19.332 --> 01:22:22.231
- Sorry. I made a joke. I love your shoes.
- No, I don't think you do.

01:22:22.231 --> 01:22:24.731
You know, I think I'm going home.

01:22:24.831 --> 01:22:26.731
I don't know anything about banking.
I don't know...

01:22:26.731 --> 01:22:29.031
- ...if it's gonna work.
- Oda Mae, could you just relax?

01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:32.331
- Listen, I'm nervous!
- I know you're nervous, but I'll get you through it.

01:22:32.431 --> 01:22:33.631
Your fake driver's
license is great.

01:22:33.631 --> 01:22:36.430
- Oh Sam, I don't think I can do this.
- Sh, you can do it.
- We're going to New Accounts.
- I'm giving them no money!
Do what I say, and don't talk!

01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:40.430
Straight ahead.
This is "New Accounts". That's where you're going.

01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:41.730
I'm giving them no money!

01:22:41.730 --> 01:22:44.030
Do what I say,
and don't talk!

01:22:47.230 --> 01:22:49.729
Tell her you're here to fill out a
signature card for a new account.

01:22:49.729 --> 01:22:50.829
Can I help you?

01:22:50.829 --> 01:22:54.531
Yes. I'm here to fill out a
signature card for a new account.

01:22:54.931 --> 01:22:56.631
And do you know
your account number?

01:22:56.631 --> 01:22:58.830
926-31043.

01:22:59.230 --> 01:23:00.130
926...

01:23:00.130 --> 01:23:01.230
31043.

01:23:01.230 --> 01:23:03.031
31043.

01:23:04.631 --> 01:23:05.531
Rita Miller.

01:23:05.531 --> 01:23:06.530
- Who?
- What?

01:23:06.630 --> 01:23:07.630
Tell her Rita Miller!

01:23:07.630 --> 01:23:08.530
Rita Miller.

01:23:08.530 --> 01:23:09.930
Didn't they have
you sign a card

01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:11.328
when you opened the account?

01:23:11.328 --> 01:23:14.328
Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for you
by phone and asked you to come in today.

01:23:14.328 --> 01:23:18.127
You see, Carl Bruner, he opened
it for me by phone, that account

01:23:18.228 --> 01:23:21.228
- and he's asked me to come in today.
- I see.

01:23:22.828 --> 01:23:25.227
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

01:23:26.128 --> 01:23:30.329
All right. Just sign this card
on the bottom line, please.

01:23:31.329 --> 01:23:34.028
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.

01:23:39.528 --> 01:23:41.527
No! No! No!
Rita Miller!

01:23:42.428 --> 01:23:44.128
I'm so sorry.

01:23:44.528 --> 01:23:45.528
You know, I...

01:23:45.528 --> 01:23:48.128
I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

01:23:55.028 --> 01:23:57.628
Now tell her to make shure it
goes straight up to the third floor file

01:23:57.728 --> 01:23:59.128
since you have a
transaction to make.

01:23:59.128 --> 01:24:01.627
Please make shure this goes
right up to the third floor file

01:24:01.627 --> 01:24:03.427
because I have a
transfusion to make.

01:24:03.427 --> 01:24:04.728
What?

01:24:05.428 --> 01:24:06.729
Let's go.

01:24:06.729 --> 01:24:09.828
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?

01:24:11.428 --> 01:24:12.828
Yes, sure.

01:24:12.928 --> 01:24:14.829
Thank you so much.

01:24:15.429 --> 01:24:18.328
Bye-bye.
I love these pens.

01:24:20.028 --> 01:24:21.828
What do you want
to keep the pen for?

01:24:23.428 --> 01:24:24.828
Carl Bruner speaking.

01:24:24.828 --> 01:24:25.928
Hi, Carl.

01:24:26.028 --> 01:24:27.327
Mr. Balistrari?

01:24:27.327 --> 01:24:29.728
Balistrari?
Carl it's me, John.

01:24:29.928 --> 01:24:34.428
John... Sorry!
What's up?

01:24:34.828 --> 01:24:36.927
I've got the info
on the Bradleyportfolio.

01:24:37.027 --> 01:24:38.428
All right, OK, look I'm...

01:24:38.428 --> 01:24:40.429
I'll just pick it up
later, all right?

01:24:40.529 --> 01:24:41.629
I'll be here till six.

01:24:41.629 --> 01:24:43.529
Good.

01:24:48.028 --> 01:24:51.228
This is it.
I couldn't talk you into losing the hat?

01:24:51.628 --> 01:24:53.928
Keep messing with me,
you'll be here by yourself.

01:24:55.428 --> 01:24:59.327
Tell the guard you're
here to see Lyle Ferguson.

01:25:00.527 --> 01:25:03.027
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.

01:25:03.127 --> 01:25:04.427
Do you have
an appointment?

01:25:04.527 --> 01:25:05.827
No, I'm here
for my health.

01:25:05.827 --> 01:25:07.627
Don't say that!
Tell him Rita Miller's here.

01:25:07.627 --> 01:25:09.927
You just tell him
Rita Miller's here.

01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:11.726
Just one moment, please.

01:25:12.326 --> 01:25:14.426
- Don't embellish.
- Jawohl.

01:25:14.926 --> 01:25:16.727
Excuse me?

01:25:19.727 --> 01:25:22.527
Now listen, this guy
Furgeson's a real jerk.

01:25:22.927 --> 01:25:24.427
I've known him for five years

01:25:24.527 --> 01:25:26.128
and he still thinks my name's...

01:25:26.128 --> 01:25:29.727
- Why are you whispering?
- Just be quiet and listen.

01:25:30.027 --> 01:25:33.027
He's a social moron, so
you don't have anything to worry about.

01:25:33.027 --> 01:25:35.327
Just tell the guard
Ferguson knows you.

01:25:35.327 --> 01:25:37.427
You spent time with
him and his wife Shirley

01:25:37.527 --> 01:25:40.526
at the Brewster's
Christmas party last year.

01:25:40.526 --> 01:25:42.627
What is this in regards to?

01:25:42.627 --> 01:25:44.727
What?
He doesn't remember me?

01:25:44.727 --> 01:25:46.227
Oh, we spent all that time

01:25:46.227 --> 01:25:49.627
at the Brewster's Christmas party
last year. He and his lovely wife, Shirley.

01:25:49.627 --> 01:25:51.128
It was beautiful.

01:25:51.128 --> 01:25:54.128
A big old tree and thousands
of presents everywhere...

01:25:57.427 --> 01:25:59.327
Gas.

01:26:00.127 --> 01:26:02.627
I get a little gas from
time to time. That's all.

01:26:02.827 --> 01:26:04.826
Gas.

01:26:05.427 --> 01:26:06.727
Quit poking me!

01:26:06.927 --> 01:26:08.927
Don't overdo it!

01:26:09.627 --> 01:26:12.127
Now listen, this'll be easy.
Furgeson was so drunk at that party

01:26:12.127 --> 01:26:16.027
he could have had a conversation
with Tina Turner and he wouldn't remember.

01:26:19.927 --> 01:26:21.827
Oh, Sam.

01:26:22.127 --> 01:26:23.726
Here we go.

01:26:26.727 --> 01:26:31.827
Hello. Hello.
Yes. Of course, yes.

01:26:31.827 --> 01:26:34.727
Well, it's been a long time.

01:26:35.127 --> 01:26:37.628
- Oh, a long time.
- Ask how Bobby and Snooky are doing.

01:26:37.628 --> 01:26:40.028
By the way, how are
Bobby and Snooky doing?

01:26:40.227 --> 01:26:42.927
Fine... fine.
Thank you.

01:26:43.127 --> 01:26:45.127
Thank you for asking.

01:26:45.327 --> 01:26:49.226
And how is your...
family?

01:26:49.326 --> 01:26:51.526
Oh, couldn't be better!

01:26:51.626 --> 01:26:54.427
Well, wonderful.

01:26:54.427 --> 01:26:57.627
Tell him you've been wondering
how they did on the Gibraltar securities.

01:26:57.627 --> 01:27:01.727
I was just wondering, how did you
do on the Gibraltar Securities?

01:27:02.127 --> 01:27:04.428
The Gibraltar Securities?

01:27:04.728 --> 01:27:07.427
Well, it looks like we
topped out on that one.

01:27:07.727 --> 01:27:08.627
We sure did.

01:27:08.627 --> 01:27:09.627
We sure did!

01:27:09.627 --> 01:27:11.327
That was a very useful tip.

01:27:11.327 --> 01:27:15.527
- Good old Randy.
- Good old Randy! Got a good old
head on his shoulders.

01:27:15.627 --> 01:27:16.927
- Her shoulders.
- Her shoulders!

01:27:16.927 --> 01:27:18.827
Her shoulders.

01:27:18.827 --> 01:27:20.526
Randy.

01:27:20.526 --> 01:27:22.326
So, what...

01:27:22.326 --> 01:27:24.026
What brings you here today?

01:27:24.126 --> 01:27:26.826
- You're closing an account.
- I'm closing an account.

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:29.426
Wonderful.
Do you have your account number?

01:27:29.426 --> 01:27:31.126
- Yes?
- Yes.
- Yes!

01:27:31.126 --> 01:27:32.726
926-31043.

01:27:32.826 --> 01:27:37.025
926...31...043.
Is that right?

01:27:37.025 --> 01:27:38.926
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:27:46.826 --> 01:27:50.427
Well, Rita - it looks like
you'll be withdrawing

01:27:50.427 --> 01:27:52.626
four million dollars
from us today.

01:27:52.626 --> 01:27:53.926
Four million dollars!

01:27:53.926 --> 01:27:55.826
Say "yes". Say "yes"!

01:27:55.826 --> 01:27:57.426
Is that correct?

01:27:57.426 --> 01:28:00.425
- Yes.
- Yes. Yes, Yes!

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:03.425
Yes. That's correct.

01:28:07.226 --> 01:28:09.326
Well, how would
you like that?

01:28:10.025 --> 01:28:12.026
- Tens and twenties?
- Pardon?

01:28:12.026 --> 01:28:14.027
A cashier's cheque.
Tell him a cashier's cheque.

01:28:14.027 --> 01:28:15.727
I think better a
cashier's cheque.

01:28:15.727 --> 01:28:18.426
A cashier's cheque.
Fine!

01:28:18.726 --> 01:28:20.526
Well. Of course, you know

01:28:20.526 --> 01:28:23.326
we require identification.

01:28:23.526 --> 01:28:26.326
- I see. Yes, yes!
- It's just a procedural thing.

01:28:37.326 --> 01:28:38.226
Thank you.

01:28:38.326 --> 01:28:40.926
Well, I'll be right back.

01:28:42.226 --> 01:28:44.326
Four million dollars!

01:28:50.926 --> 01:28:54.026
Get me the First lsland Bank
of Nassau. It's on the Rolodex.

01:29:04.826 --> 01:29:08.024
We have some things
for you to sign here.

01:29:08.124 --> 01:29:11.024
This officially closes
the account.

01:29:13.723 --> 01:29:15.724
Sign "Rita Miller."

01:29:18.424 --> 01:29:20.923
Miller.
That's my name.

01:29:21.223 --> 01:29:24.124
My name - Rita Miller.
My name.

01:29:25.625 --> 01:29:27.025
My name.

01:29:27.125 --> 01:29:28.125
Molly, hi.

01:29:28.125 --> 01:29:29.225
Hi.

01:29:29.425 --> 01:29:31.824
Oda Mae,
I'll be right back.

01:29:32.624 --> 01:29:34.224
Just anywhere?

01:29:34.224 --> 01:29:36.124
Right here.

01:29:41.024 --> 01:29:42.624
Fine.

01:29:43.423 --> 01:29:45.923
The cheque.

01:29:45.923 --> 01:29:49.423
Here you are.

01:29:58.122 --> 01:30:00.722
Mama took the money that
she maid in the oil well

01:30:00.922 --> 01:30:02.923
and she sunk it into gas pumps.

01:30:02.923 --> 01:30:05.723
You know, every gas station has 'em.
And those gas stations

01:30:05.723 --> 01:30:08.923
have five or six of those things,
so it's very lucrative.

01:30:08.923 --> 01:30:10.623
- Oda Mae...
-  It really adds up.

01:30:10.623 --> 01:30:11.924
Oda Mae, we've got
to go, say goodbye.

01:30:11.924 --> 01:30:14.723
Well, got to go now.
It's been a pleasure doing business with you.

01:30:14.723 --> 01:30:17.423
A real pleasure.
Now may I keep the pen?

01:30:18.023 --> 01:30:20.523
Say goodnight to
Bobby and Snooky for me.

01:30:20.623 --> 01:30:23.622
Bye-bye.
Why are you pushing me?

01:30:28.223 --> 01:30:30.323
What is wrong?

01:30:39.724 --> 01:30:41.024
Excuse me - Lyle?

01:30:41.024 --> 01:30:42.623
Oh, yes er...

01:30:42.723 --> 01:30:44.323
Molly. Jensen.

01:30:44.323 --> 01:30:46.923
The woman you were
just doing business with.

01:30:47.123 --> 01:30:49.023
- Yeah?
- What did she want?

01:30:49.023 --> 01:30:52.023
I mean, did it have
anything to do with me or Sam?

01:30:52.123 --> 01:30:54.423
Sam? No.

01:30:54.923 --> 01:30:56.523
That was Oda Mae
Brown, right?

01:30:56.523 --> 01:30:58.924
No, her name was Rita Miller.

01:30:59.023 --> 01:31:02.523
And she was closing an account.
Is there a problem?

01:31:03.923 --> 01:31:07.323
No. I guess not.
Thank you.

01:31:36.822 --> 01:31:39.523
Carl?
Something wrong?

01:31:39.723 --> 01:31:41.623
Did somebody play
with the computers?

01:31:41.623 --> 01:31:43.023
What?

01:31:43.023 --> 01:31:44.422
One of my accounts is closed.

01:31:44.522 --> 01:31:46.523
Which account?
What's wrong?

01:31:46.623 --> 01:31:48.824
You want me
to call someone?

01:31:49.124 --> 01:31:51.224
No, it's OK.
I can do it.

01:31:51.224 --> 01:31:53.523
I got it.

01:31:55.923 --> 01:31:57.323
Four million dollars!

01:31:57.323 --> 01:31:59.223
Oh, my God!
What am I going to do with this money?

01:31:59.223 --> 01:32:01.722
You know, I'm gonna buy the building.
No, no, wait.

01:32:01.722 --> 01:32:04.423
I'm gonna buy the block.
I'm gonna make my sister go to a fat farm

01:32:04.523 --> 01:32:07.122
- ...cause she is way too...
- No, wait.

01:32:07.122 --> 01:32:10.722
- Yeah, I'm gonna buy the building...
- Wait, Oda Mae. I've got an idea.

01:32:11.122 --> 01:32:13.622
- Take the cheque out of your purse.
- You're right, you're right.

01:32:13.622 --> 01:32:15.122
I should take it out,
I should put it

01:32:15.122 --> 01:32:17.822
- ...where nobody can get it.
- No.

01:32:17.822 --> 01:32:19.821
Endorse it.

01:32:19.821 --> 01:32:21.421
No, if I endorse it,
and then if I drop it

01:32:21.421 --> 01:32:24.222
- then somebody will get it. No, I just...
- It's not your money.

01:32:24.322 --> 01:32:26.723
I never said you
gonna get the money.

01:32:27.323 --> 01:32:29.422
This is blood money.
I was killed for this money.

01:32:29.422 --> 01:32:31.322
Now endorse the cheque.

01:32:32.322 --> 01:32:34.923
But Sam, what are
you gonna do with it?

01:32:35.323 --> 01:32:37.422
Look over there.

01:32:37.722 --> 01:32:39.622
To your left.

01:32:42.422 --> 01:32:46.122
No, you don't think I'm giving these 4
million dollars to a bunch of nuns.

01:32:46.321 --> 01:32:48.621
Oda Mae, if you don't do it,
they will track you down.

01:32:48.721 --> 01:32:51.122
Your only protection
is to get rid of it.

01:32:51.222 --> 01:32:54.122
Oh Sam, come on, you're killing me!
It's 4 million dollars!

01:32:54.122 --> 01:32:56.821
Just think of it this way.
You'll go to heaven.

01:32:56.821 --> 01:32:57.822
I don't want to
go to heaven.

01:32:57.822 --> 01:33:00.823
I want to go to a bank and
cash the goddam cheque.

01:33:04.023 --> 01:33:06.322
- Hello.
- You'll thank me later.

01:33:06.322 --> 01:33:08.222
How are you doing.

01:33:09.922 --> 01:33:12.822
- Endorse it "Rita Miller."
- I know!

01:33:13.121 --> 01:33:15.622
Make it out to
St. Joseph's Shelter.

01:33:15.922 --> 01:33:18.222
I don't believe
you're making me do this.

01:33:24.022 --> 01:33:25.022
Give it to her.

01:33:25.022 --> 01:33:27.422
Well, I just want to feel it
one more time in my fingers.

01:33:27.422 --> 01:33:28.822
Just give the
lady the cheque.

01:33:28.922 --> 01:33:31.321
I will!

01:33:33.121 --> 01:33:35.322
Hand her the cheque.
You can do it.

01:33:38.023 --> 01:33:41.322
- Give her cheque!
- I will!

01:33:44.022 --> 01:33:47.023
Bless you, child.
Bless you.

01:33:52.922 --> 01:33:54.822
Give to.

01:33:55.022 --> 01:33:57.821
Let go!

01:34:04.722 --> 01:34:05.922
I'm proud of you, Oda Mae.

01:34:05.922 --> 01:34:09.222
You know Sam, I don't care if you proud of me.
You stay away from me from now on!

01:34:09.222 --> 01:34:10.722
What'll that nun
gonna do with it?

01:34:10.722 --> 01:34:12.723
She can't go buy underwear!
Nothing! I hate you.

01:34:12.723 --> 01:34:15.522
Leave me alone!
Never talk to me again.

01:34:15.622 --> 01:34:17.822
I think you're
wonderful, Oda Mae.

01:34:53.621 --> 01:34:56.822
Go ahead, search!
You'll never find it.

01:34:58.322 --> 01:35:00.321
They're going to kill you, Carl.

01:35:00.421 --> 01:35:01.821
You and Willie.

01:35:01.821 --> 01:35:03.821
You're going to be fertiliser.

01:35:04.221 --> 01:35:07.219
They're going to bury
you right next to Jimmy Hoffa.

01:35:51.419 --> 01:35:53.519
Who's doing that?

01:35:53.818 --> 01:35:56.218
Who's doing that?

01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:12.519
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:36:12.519 --> 01:36:14.519
Where were you?
I thought we were having dinner.

01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:16.519
I know, Moll.
I'm sorry.

01:36:16.519 --> 01:36:18.319
Things got a little crazy,
I just forgot.

01:36:18.319 --> 01:36:19.919
Yeah, a little
trouble at the bank.

01:36:19.919 --> 01:36:23.918
Forgot? You know, I wish you'd
have called me. I've been worried.

01:36:25.419 --> 01:36:27.819
Listen to me Molly, I've got
to ask you about something.

01:36:28.019 --> 01:36:30.018
Yeah. He needs to
borrow 4 million dollars.

01:36:30.218 --> 01:36:34.620
When you said you thought that
Sam was here, that he was talking to you

01:36:34.720 --> 01:36:37.020
what did you feel?
What did he say to you?

01:36:37.220 --> 01:36:38.719
Why? Does it have
to do with anything?

01:36:38.719 --> 01:36:41.019
It's just...
Listen to me for a second.

01:36:41.319 --> 01:36:44.319
This psychic lady I want to know what she told you.
I want to know exactly what she said.

01:36:44.319 --> 01:36:46.919
Carl, let me go.
Stop this!

01:36:49.219 --> 01:36:52.018
It doesn't matter.
It wasn't real.

01:36:53.318 --> 01:36:55.318
What the hell's
happened to you tonight?

01:36:56.219 --> 01:36:59.018
Does this have anything to do
with her being at the bank today?

01:37:02.718 --> 01:37:04.718
At the bank?

01:37:04.818 --> 01:37:08.117
Yeah, Ferguson said
she closed an account.

01:37:08.317 --> 01:37:10.518
Her name isn't even
Oda Mae Brown. It's...

01:37:10.718 --> 01:37:13.719
Rita Miller.
Or something.

01:37:16.718 --> 01:37:18.818
Carl.
Are you all right?

01:37:21.019 --> 01:37:23.218
It's just my stomach. It's...

01:37:25.718 --> 01:37:30.318
- Jesus.
- Do you have any... like...
some Pepto-Bismol or something?

01:37:30.618 --> 01:37:32.517
- Cyanide?..
- Yeah, it's upstairs.

01:37:32.517 --> 01:37:34.917
Why don't you sit
down, I will get it.

01:37:41.417 --> 01:37:44.918
What's wrong?
Does little Carl have a tummy ache?

01:37:52.018 --> 01:37:54.118
Now do you believe
in ghosts?

01:37:58.118 --> 01:38:00.218
I'll set the place on fire,
I swear to God!

01:38:08.218 --> 01:38:09.818
I'll cut her throat.

01:38:09.818 --> 01:38:11.518
Carl.

01:38:12.318 --> 01:38:14.118
I swear to God.

01:38:14.118 --> 01:38:16.118
I'll cut her throat.

01:38:18.617 --> 01:38:20.117
I need that money
and I want it tonight

01:38:20.117 --> 01:38:21.818
at 11 o'clock.

01:38:22.118 --> 01:38:24.619
If that psychic lady
does not bring it here

01:38:25.019 --> 01:38:27.218
Molly is dead, OK?

01:38:28.218 --> 01:38:30.018
Carl, who are
you talking to?

01:38:30.018 --> 01:38:32.719
Nothing. Molly...
I have to go, OK.

01:38:33.419 --> 01:38:35.718
I can't explain this now,
but there's a problem, OK.

01:38:35.718 --> 01:38:36.918
Something going
on at the bank.

01:38:36.918 --> 01:38:38.218
Carl, you're
really scaring me.

01:38:38.218 --> 01:38:40.818
I'm sorry, Moll, look, I don't
have time to talk now, but I'll come back.

01:38:40.818 --> 01:38:42.318
Why? Why not now?

01:38:42.318 --> 01:38:44.217
I can't talk now, Molly.
Look, I'll come back.

01:38:44.217 --> 01:38:46.617
What do you say,
like, at 11 o'clock, OK?

01:38:46.617 --> 01:38:48.118
I'm sorry, I did this Moll

01:38:48.118 --> 01:38:49.918
but it's really important.
I've got to go, OK?

01:38:49.918 --> 01:38:51.818
- Eleven!
- Oda Mae.

01:38:55.418 --> 01:38:56.418
I'm Arsenio Hall.

01:38:56.418 --> 01:38:58.819
Don't try to
adjust your television.

01:38:58.919 --> 01:39:00.719
I'm black.

01:39:01.518 --> 01:39:02.918
I want to watch
"Love Connection."

01:39:02.918 --> 01:39:04.518
I love "Love Connection."

01:39:05.518 --> 01:39:07.418
Leave that!
That's Arsenio.

01:39:07.418 --> 01:39:08.318
So?

01:39:08.318 --> 01:39:10.217
You love "Love Connection"

01:39:10.217 --> 01:39:11.718
send your picture in.

01:39:11.718 --> 01:39:13.018
She did already!

01:39:13.118 --> 01:39:15.017
They just haven't answered yet.

01:39:15.217 --> 01:39:16.517
Oda Mae!

01:39:16.517 --> 01:39:18.517
- Sam?
- No, not again.

01:39:18.517 --> 01:39:20.517
Oda Mae, we're in trouble,
they want the cheque. And they're coming for you.

01:39:20.517 --> 01:39:22.817
- You gotta get outta here.
- What do you mean "they want the cheque"?

01:39:22.817 --> 01:39:25.617
The cheque you said they
would never know about?

01:39:25.617 --> 01:39:27.517
- Oda Mae, what's happening?
- Sam!

01:39:27.617 --> 01:39:29.116
They're here, they're here!
Get out of here, now!

01:39:29.116 --> 01:39:30.816
Go, go!

01:39:32.216 --> 01:39:33.517
Come on.
Come on!

01:39:43.218 --> 01:39:45.018
Knock on the doors!

01:39:45.418 --> 01:39:47.417
Help!

01:39:47.817 --> 01:39:49.117
It's emergency!
You've got to let us in!

01:39:49.117 --> 01:39:50.717
Who are you kidding?

01:40:00.217 --> 01:40:01.717
Open!

01:40:02.017 --> 01:40:04.216
What are you doing?
The cat don't like visitors.

01:40:16.417 --> 01:40:20.317
They're going to get us.
Where's Sam?

01:40:20.517 --> 01:40:22.517
Shit! It looks like
the bitch just left.

01:40:22.517 --> 01:40:24.417
I'll check downstairs.

01:40:35.717 --> 01:40:37.517
Carl?

01:41:27.115 --> 01:41:28.815
Willie!

01:41:37.515 --> 01:41:39.514
You've got a
serious problem, man.

01:42:02.314 --> 01:42:04.114
Help me!

01:42:04.114 --> 01:42:06.015
Help!

01:42:14.114 --> 01:42:15.914
Willie!

01:43:02.014 --> 01:43:04.013
That dude is dead.

01:43:09.215 --> 01:43:11.115
You're dead, Willie.

01:43:33.814 --> 01:43:38.413
No!

01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:42.815
Help me!

01:44:05.013 --> 01:44:07.013
Tell the driver to hurry.

01:44:07.513 --> 01:44:09.313
Yo, man, can you
step on it, please?

01:44:09.313 --> 01:44:11.813
Listen, lady,
I'm driving as fast as I can.

01:44:20.414 --> 01:44:22.314
Problems?

01:44:29.614 --> 01:44:30.714
Carl, is that you?

01:44:30.714 --> 01:44:32.713
No, it's me, Oda Mae.
Listen to me.

01:44:32.713 --> 01:44:35.013
Molly, I know what you think of me.
I know what you think of me.

01:44:35.013 --> 01:44:37.713
But, look, you've got to talk to me.
You are in serious danger.

01:44:38.613 --> 01:44:41.512
I've got Sam here with me.
We've got to come it and talk to you.

01:44:41.512 --> 01:44:43.112
Get the hell out of here.

01:44:43.212 --> 01:44:46.113
- I'm calling the police.
- Good! Tell her to do it.

01:44:46.113 --> 01:44:49.013
Fine! That's what we want you to do,
we want you to call the police.

01:44:49.213 --> 01:44:51.412
- But you've got to let us in.
- No.

01:44:51.912 --> 01:44:56.114
Don't you get it? Sam was not just
accidentally killed, he was murdered.

01:44:56.314 --> 01:44:59.113
He found out that Carl was
laundering money at the bank.

01:44:59.213 --> 01:45:01.513
This guy Carl is dangerous.
I'm telling you!

01:45:01.513 --> 01:45:02.513
He tried to kill me.

01:45:02.513 --> 01:45:04.713
He's going to
try to kill you, too.

01:45:04.713 --> 01:45:06.813
You are in
deep, deep trouble.

01:45:07.013 --> 01:45:09.313
Why are you doing this to me?

01:45:09.813 --> 01:45:11.613
Why are you doing this to me?

01:45:11.613 --> 01:45:14.313
Do you hear me?
Why are you doing this to me?

01:45:14.313 --> 01:45:17.613
I can't...
I just can't...

01:45:17.813 --> 01:45:20.013
Oda Mae.
Tell her

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:23.213
tell her she's wearing the
shirt that I spilt the margarita on

01:45:23.513 --> 01:45:26.012
and the earrings
I gave her for Christmas.

01:45:26.712 --> 01:45:30.413
Molly, Sam says to tell you you're wearing
the shirt that he spilt the margarita on

01:45:30.813 --> 01:45:33.414
and the earrings he
gave you for Christmas.

01:45:39.613 --> 01:45:42.014
Don't you see?
I'm not a fake!

01:45:42.014 --> 01:45:44.113
Not about this.

01:45:48.513 --> 01:45:49.913
Give me a penny, quick.

01:45:49.913 --> 01:45:50.913
What?

01:45:50.913 --> 01:45:52.612
Push a penny
under the door, now!

01:45:52.612 --> 01:45:54.612
What are you talking about -
"push a penny under the door"?

01:45:54.712 --> 01:45:56.313
Just do it.

01:46:33.812 --> 01:46:35.312
Tell her it's for luck.

01:46:35.412 --> 01:46:37.811
Sam says it's for luck.

01:47:13.509 --> 01:47:15.710
Between Green and
Mercer on Prince.

01:47:16.010 --> 01:47:19.111
It's the grey building right
across from the post office.

01:47:19.211 --> 01:47:21.610
Thanks, Sergeant.
Please hurry.

01:47:21.710 --> 01:47:23.510
We'll be waiting.

01:47:23.610 --> 01:47:25.010
Right, they're on their way.

01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:27.510
Good.

01:47:28.210 --> 01:47:31.910
- So, what do we do now?
- Just wait.

01:47:41.810 --> 01:47:43.610
Is Sam here?

01:47:45.010 --> 01:47:46.710
Sam?

01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:49.809
I'm sitting beside her.

01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:53.210
He's sitting right beside you.

01:48:03.011 --> 01:48:05.111
Sam, can you feel me?

01:48:06.610 --> 01:48:08.710
With all my heart.

01:48:09.610 --> 01:48:11.810
He says with all his heart.

01:48:23.909 --> 01:48:25.009
I'd give anything

01:48:25.009 --> 01:48:27.810
if I could just touch
you once more.

01:48:31.311 --> 01:48:33.510
He says he wishes
he was alive again

01:48:33.510 --> 01:48:35.610
so he could touch you.

01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:40.510
Me, too.

01:48:56.809 --> 01:48:58.909
OK. Look.

01:48:59.109 --> 01:49:01.008
You can use me.

01:49:01.908 --> 01:49:03.408
Use you?

01:49:03.608 --> 01:49:05.109
You can use my body.

01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:06.210
Use your body?

01:49:06.210 --> 01:49:09.009
Just do it  quick,
before I change my mind.

01:52:14.008 --> 01:52:15.608
Molly!

01:52:17.008 --> 01:52:18.608
Molly, are you home?

01:52:19.008 --> 01:52:20.808
It's Carl.

01:52:20.808 --> 01:52:21.908
Molly!

01:52:21.908 --> 01:52:23.608
Fire escape.

01:52:30.408 --> 01:52:32.308
What's happening to me?

01:52:36.307 --> 01:52:38.007
Molly?

01:52:38.708 --> 01:52:40.609
Molly?

01:52:48.909 --> 01:52:50.709
Molly!

01:53:05.506 --> 01:53:07.306
Come on.

01:53:10.505 --> 01:53:12.306
Look!

01:53:13.206 --> 01:53:14.607
Let's go.

01:53:24.806 --> 01:53:26.406
Molly!

01:53:26.506 --> 01:53:28.506
Just get away from us, Carl!

01:53:31.806 --> 01:53:33.705
- Molly!
- You're a liar.

01:53:33.705 --> 01:53:36.206
Molly, you've got to listen to me.
This woman's a thief!

01:53:36.306 --> 01:53:37.405
She's a con artist.

01:53:37.405 --> 01:53:40.605
- Why are you doing this?
- Don't listen to her, Molly!

01:53:42.205 --> 01:53:43.905
Stop!

01:53:43.905 --> 01:53:45.804
Just get away
from us, Carl.

01:53:45.804 --> 01:53:47.304
I've called the police.

01:53:56.905 --> 01:53:58.705
Shit.

01:54:01.006 --> 01:54:02.206
Carl, why are you doing this?

01:54:02.206 --> 01:54:04.605
Don't interfere, Molly!
She's a thief!

01:54:06.605 --> 01:54:09.405
Cheque!
Just give me the cheque.

01:54:09.405 --> 01:54:11.505
Stay out of this, Molly!

01:54:15.905 --> 01:54:17.505
Son of a bitch.

01:54:17.805 --> 01:54:20.305
Keep out of this, Molly!

01:54:20.405 --> 01:54:23.304
Get off me!

01:54:28.306 --> 01:54:30.305
Where is it?
Where is it?

01:54:30.405 --> 01:54:32.205
Where is it, goddammit?

01:54:32.205 --> 01:54:33.605
I gave it away.

01:54:33.605 --> 01:54:35.205
You're lying to me.

01:54:35.205 --> 01:54:38.305
Don't lie to me,
goddammit!

01:54:40.405 --> 01:54:42.405
The cheque.

01:54:54.505 --> 01:54:55.905
I'll kill her, Sam.

01:54:55.905 --> 01:54:57.904
I swear to God, I'll kill her!

01:55:03.906 --> 01:55:05.805
Just...

01:55:06.005 --> 01:55:07.805
Look.

01:55:07.805 --> 01:55:10.705
Just give me the
cheque, Sam, OK?

01:55:10.705 --> 01:55:11.906
I promise you I'll let her go

01:55:11.906 --> 01:55:14.106
if you just give it to me.

01:55:14.106 --> 01:55:16.005
OK?

01:55:16.605 --> 01:55:18.505
Sam?

01:55:20.005 --> 01:55:21.905
Sam?

01:56:38.203 --> 01:56:40.104
Sam?

01:56:42.004 --> 01:56:43.704
Oh, Carl.

01:56:44.003 --> 01:56:45.703
What?

01:57:17.804 --> 01:57:19.803
Help!

01:57:53.204 --> 01:57:55.104
Are you two all right?

01:57:58.804 --> 01:58:00.605
Sam?

01:58:02.905 --> 01:58:04.504
Molly?

01:58:06.704 --> 01:58:08.504
I can hear you.

01:58:44.803 --> 01:58:46.704
Oh, God.

01:59:34.101 --> 01:59:36.001
Sam?

01:59:36.301 --> 01:59:38.501
They're waiting for you, Sam.

01:59:49.302 --> 01:59:51.302
I'll miss you.

01:59:52.601 --> 01:59:54.601
Your mother'd be proud.

01:59:55.501 --> 01:59:58.002
I'm gonna miss you too, Sam.

01:59:58.402 --> 02:00:00.501
You're all right.

02:00:01.701 --> 02:00:03.801
Bye, Oda Mae.

02:00:04.501 --> 02:00:06.501
Bye, Sam.

02:00:28.701 --> 02:00:30.701
I love you, Molly.

02:00:32.801 --> 02:00:34.801
I've always loved you.

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:43.500
Ditto.

02:01:04.100 --> 02:01:06.100
It's amazing, Molly.

02:01:07.100 --> 02:01:09.101
The love inside

02:01:09.501 --> 02:01:11.701
you take it with you.

02:01:22.599 --> 02:01:24.500
See you.

02:01:31.599 --> 02:01:33.500
See you.

02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:53.800
Bye.
