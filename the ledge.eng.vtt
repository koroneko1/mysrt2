WEBVTT

01:50.536 --> 01:52.672
So, here we are,

01:52.705 --> 01:56.042
trying to get our packs down
as light as we can.

01:56.075 --> 01:58.811
Otherwise, halfway up that rock, they're
going to feel like SUVs on our backs.

01:58.844 --> 01:59.843
We don't want that.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.446
Roger that.

02:20.399 --> 02:22.168
<i>Are you ready?</i>

02:22.201 --> 02:23.767
<i>I think so.</i>

02:31.977 --> 02:33.546
Yeah!

02:33.579 --> 02:35.548
Geez. That scared
the crap out of me.

02:38.817 --> 02:41.254
Yeah, come on!
Let's do this!

02:41.287 --> 02:43.422
Come here, big guy.
Give me a hug.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.092
Well, this weekend just got
a whole lot more interesting.

02:46.125 --> 02:48.594
Ah! Smell that air, dudes.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.963
And none of that NYC smog shit
up here, huh?

02:50.996 --> 02:53.599
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

02:59.738 --> 03:02.139
Get up that mountain!

03:07.346 --> 03:08.478
Hmm.

03:09.915 --> 03:13.252
Hey, I'm Josh. We just arrived.

03:13.285 --> 03:16.255
You, um, <i>parle americano?</i>

03:16.288 --> 03:19.258
I'm Sophie. And that's Kelly.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.227
- Hey.
- American.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.592
LA.

03:23.462 --> 03:26.599
Sophie,
that was my mother's name.

03:26.632 --> 03:29.399
Geez, bud,
is that the best you got?

03:30.969 --> 03:34.974
So, me and my boys are wondering if
you wanted to come and, uh, party.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.810
- We're having kind of a celebration.
- What are you celebrating?

03:37.843 --> 03:41.781
Being in the middle of nowhere like four
homos when a couple of movie stars show up.

03:41.814 --> 03:44.881
Seriously, dude, 1980 called,
it wants its pickup lines back.

03:49.555 --> 03:53.192
Anyway, um,
thanks for the offer, but...

03:53.225 --> 03:56.626
Well, if you and your mom
change your mind...

04:00.532 --> 04:01.667
Cheers.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.266
- <i>Ciao.</i>
- <i>Ciao.</i>

04:05.037 --> 04:08.841
Hey, the locals, they just tried to climb
the face but couldn't get past the ledge.

04:08.874 --> 04:12.678
They said there's already ice up there.
We're the only ones going up.

04:12.711 --> 04:14.814
Even left some of their gear.

04:14.847 --> 04:17.650
Well, what do you expect?
This ain't California.

04:17.683 --> 04:21.120
- Where's Josh?
- Where do you think he is?

04:21.153 --> 04:24.457
- Well, he doesn't waste much time.
- Isn't he supposed to be engaged?

04:24.490 --> 04:26.325
Yeah. To Amy Manners.

04:26.358 --> 04:29.128
Taylor and me were talking
on the way out here.

04:29.161 --> 04:32.031
We can't keep doing the same shit forever,
man. We're not in college anymore.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.467
We thought with you guys
both living in New York...

04:34.500 --> 04:38.504
I hardly see him. The truth is,
Jessica can't stand him or his fiancÃ©e.

04:38.537 --> 04:40.873
- She won't even have them in the house.
- Holy shit.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.175
We come halfway around the world
to nail some Euro tail

04:43.208 --> 04:45.811
and end up next to
a couple of Cali prick-teasers.

04:45.844 --> 04:47.344
What are you fags doing anyway?

04:49.081 --> 04:53.085
I'm out there trying to get us laid and
you're here playing with your dicks.

04:53.118 --> 04:55.054
In which case, I'm in.

04:55.087 --> 04:56.822
- Oh, shit! No, no.
- Come on!

04:56.855 --> 04:58.924
- No, man.
- Yeah! I love you, dude.

04:58.957 --> 05:01.494
I miss you. Don't believe me?

05:01.527 --> 05:04.730
- Can you feel my wood right now?
- Oh, get that thing away from me.

05:04.763 --> 05:07.032
Just because you're working for
some congressman doesn't mean

05:07.065 --> 05:09.702
you can forget your friends.
I know stuff about you, don't forget.

05:09.735 --> 05:11.771
- Yeah, what's that supposed to mean?
- You know how it is.

05:11.804 --> 05:13.272
You're having
a couple of drinks,

05:13.305 --> 05:15.541
start to shoot the shit,
and all of a sudden

05:15.574 --> 05:17.843
you're telling a stranger at
a bar how that guy up on TV

05:17.876 --> 05:20.079
used to be a crazy son of
a bitch back in the day.

05:20.112 --> 05:21.947
You want more money?
Is that it?

05:21.980 --> 05:24.750
- What did you say?
- Ah! You're hurting me!

05:24.783 --> 05:28.020
You might be able to fool those assholes
in Washington your shit don't stink,

05:28.053 --> 05:30.389
but don't forget
how far we go back.

05:30.422 --> 05:31.955
Get off me!

05:33.792 --> 05:35.992
You're one dumb son of a bitch,
you know that?

05:41.733 --> 05:44.570
- One drink.
- We're planning to leave at first light.

05:44.603 --> 05:46.705
And we will, come on.

05:46.738 --> 05:48.705
I'll even let you have
the pretty one.

05:51.076 --> 05:53.779
I'm sorry,
that's not what I meant.

05:53.812 --> 05:55.879
You're allowed
to have fun, Kel.

05:56.582 --> 05:59.151
Okay. One drink.

05:59.184 --> 06:02.588
Really? Yay, thank you!

06:02.621 --> 06:04.423
Stop! Get off me!

06:04.456 --> 06:07.824
Get off me
or I'll change my mind.

06:10.262 --> 06:12.498
All I'm saying is it takes a woman

06:12.531 --> 06:14.667
to know her way around
another woman's body.

06:14.700 --> 06:18.804
I mean, guys just dive in like
they're eating an orange or something.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.507
With girls,
we know what each other wants.

06:21.540 --> 06:23.843
Is that how you keep each other
warm at night in that cabin?

06:23.876 --> 06:26.645
Well, yeah.
What do you think this is for?

06:26.678 --> 06:29.679
I just came in my pants.

06:31.216 --> 06:33.617
So how long have you guys known each other?
Wait, let me guess.

06:34.386 --> 06:36.155
Frat boys, right?

06:36.188 --> 06:39.091
You were the cool kids in college.
Best days of your lives.

06:39.124 --> 06:41.527
And now you're out here
trying to relive your youth.

06:41.560 --> 06:44.129
We met at summer camp
and started climbing.

06:44.162 --> 06:45.998
We meet the same week
every year,

06:46.031 --> 06:48.033
pick a spot and away we go.

06:48.066 --> 06:49.702
You know where you are, right?

06:49.735 --> 06:52.972
The Dolomites.
These are some pretty big rocks.

06:53.005 --> 06:55.641
- Well, if you need any help up there...
- We can take care of ourselves.

06:55.674 --> 06:57.510
Okay.

06:57.543 --> 06:59.712
Geez, when you walked
into the store,

06:59.745 --> 07:02.515
I'm guessing they didn't
have the big watch that day.

07:02.548 --> 07:05.217
Isn't that supposed to say
something about the size of your...

07:05.250 --> 07:10.856
No, wait, that's a car. I bet you have,
what now, a big red, shiny Ferrari?

07:10.889 --> 07:13.626
- Right?
- Ooh. She got you, man.

07:13.659 --> 07:16.161
- It's a Maserati.
- Oh, shit!

07:18.764 --> 07:21.800
Now, this baby is
the Ritmo Mundo Quantum Elite,

07:21.833 --> 07:23.802
with personalized
locator beacon.

07:23.835 --> 07:27.473
Now, anywhere I am in the world,
I just push this button

07:27.506 --> 07:30.809
and all of a sudden a bunch of
secret ninjas come out of nowhere.

07:30.842 --> 07:34.246
I'm sure it's really useful when you're
cruising your Maserati through Manhattan.

07:34.279 --> 07:37.016
Oh, so you want to see it?
You want to see? You want to...

07:37.049 --> 07:39.718
- Should we meet the ninjas?
- Don't start, man. Don't do it.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.154
- No, no. I'm doing it.
- He's doing this.

07:42.187 --> 07:44.690
- No, no. Don't do it.
- She's asked for it. Here come the ninjas.

07:44.723 --> 07:47.593
Here we go. They're coming.

07:47.626 --> 07:50.260
Ooh, ooh!

07:51.797 --> 07:53.165
Maybe not this time.

07:53.198 --> 07:54.197
Hallelujah.

07:58.236 --> 08:00.439
- No ninjas today.
- That was close, dude.

08:00.472 --> 08:02.038
So, hey, what's your story?

08:03.976 --> 08:05.275
You don't want to know.

08:06.645 --> 08:09.114
We're going on Antelao,
taming the king.

08:09.147 --> 08:10.282
Oh, so are we.

08:10.315 --> 08:11.450
I'm talking sheer.

08:11.483 --> 08:12.849
The face?

08:13.719 --> 08:15.318
That's 10,000 feet.

08:16.455 --> 08:18.457
You guys are for real, huh?

08:18.490 --> 08:20.893
- How about you guys?
- Uh, you know,

08:20.926 --> 08:24.029
we may be pretty high right now,
but we're not crazy.

08:24.062 --> 08:27.399
We're taking the scenic route,
up the back passage.

08:27.432 --> 08:31.403
Four guys in one cabin? I bet there's
bound to be some back passage involved.

08:31.436 --> 08:33.205
I'm not a fucking asshole man.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.642
I'm going to hit the sack.

08:39.945 --> 08:42.281
- Don't forget this.
- Thanks.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.083
- Um, I kind of like it here.
- Okay.

08:44.116 --> 08:45.548
Why don't you stay?

08:47.019 --> 08:48.587
Let go of my arm.

08:48.620 --> 08:50.823
- She's tired, man.
- Yeah, man, let her go.

08:50.856 --> 08:52.422
Let go of my arm.

08:58.697 --> 09:00.530
Well, your friend's
a real buzzkill.

09:04.269 --> 09:07.006
<i>We've been
planning this trip for two years.</i>

09:07.039 --> 09:09.441
<i>This is our hero, Luca.</i>

09:09.474 --> 09:11.076
<i>Say hi to the camera, Luca.</i>

09:11.109 --> 09:13.912
<i>Hi to the camera, Luca.</i>

09:13.945 --> 09:16.281
<i>Tell them how many times
you've climbed Antelao.</i>

09:16.314 --> 09:19.184
<i>Ah,
this is actually number five.</i>

09:19.217 --> 09:21.654
<i>And how does it feel
to be taking a virgin with you?</i>

09:21.687 --> 09:24.356
<i>A virgin? I thought
I was climbing with you today.</i>

09:24.389 --> 09:28.460
- <i>Hey!</i>
- <i>This is Kelly's first attempt to climb Mount Antelao.</i>

09:28.493 --> 09:30.560
<i>Stay tuned to see how she...</i>

09:58.390 --> 10:01.224
- Yo, maybe she's had enough.
- Maybe you should shut your mouth.

10:02.594 --> 10:07.332
Hey, um, so tomorrow,
why don't we climb with you?

10:09.367 --> 10:10.569
What's so funny?

10:10.602 --> 10:12.037
Well, you guys are tourists.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.039
Tourists?

10:14.072 --> 10:17.309
Well, yeah. You're taking the
pussy route to the shoulder

10:17.342 --> 10:19.878
and then walking
the path to the top.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.414
I've got a ten-year-old niece
who could do that climb.

10:22.447 --> 10:25.317
Why don't I take you back to my
cabin, show you who the pussy is?

10:25.350 --> 10:29.254
Oh. Well, if you don't have the
balls to climb that rock like a man,

10:29.287 --> 10:32.357
you're not going to be of any
use to me in that cabin, sweetie.

10:49.908 --> 10:52.578
Hey, guys, can I get in on this?
Sharing is caring, right?

10:52.611 --> 10:55.111
Come on. I need to pee.

10:57.816 --> 11:00.719
Hey, man, maybe you shouldn't.

11:00.752 --> 11:03.522
You know, what with...
with Amy and all.

11:03.555 --> 11:07.426
- Amy? Amy who?
- Come on, man.

11:07.459 --> 11:10.395
You think I'm going to dip my dick in the
same grease pot for the next 40 years?

11:10.428 --> 11:13.432
I don't know, man.
She's, uh, had a lot to drink.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.100
You guys should cool off.

11:15.133 --> 11:17.534
So says the voice
of marital bliss.

11:18.770 --> 11:21.304
Tell you what, why don't you
put the kids to bed.

11:21.940 --> 11:23.173
Don't wait up.

11:29.848 --> 11:33.316
Look, one of us is going
to have to say something. Right?

11:33.952 --> 11:35.919
We tell him together?

11:41.259 --> 11:42.258
You scared me.

11:44.462 --> 11:46.596
Hey, slow down, cowboy.

11:48.166 --> 11:51.603
Get off me! Stop it!

11:51.636 --> 11:54.106
- You got a pretty little mouth, don't you?
- Let go of me!

11:55.841 --> 11:58.143
- Fucking bitch!
- No! Leave me...

11:59.544 --> 12:01.344
- Let go of me!
- You hear that?

12:04.683 --> 12:09.688
- Stop it! Stop!
- Don't have the balls.

12:09.721 --> 12:11.156
Isn't that what you said?

12:16.661 --> 12:20.029
- Fucking... Get the fuck off me!
- Cut it out! Stop it! Stop it!

12:20.899 --> 12:22.031
Stop it, both.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.169
What the fuck are you doing?

12:24.202 --> 12:25.702
What happened to your face?

12:28.573 --> 12:31.476
We've just got to find her and talk to her.
Okay? You were drunk.

12:31.509 --> 12:33.846
- He was trying to rape her!
- It's just a little misunderstanding.

12:33.879 --> 12:36.648
Right, Josh? Right?

12:36.681 --> 12:39.151
- Sure.
- So, we've just got to find her

12:39.184 --> 12:40.550
and talk to her, okay?

12:41.553 --> 12:42.919
Come on.

12:44.589 --> 12:47.993
- Sophie!
- Hey, come on, we're not going to hurt you!

12:48.026 --> 12:50.629
Sophie, come on.
It's a misunderstanding!

12:50.662 --> 12:51.897
Sophie?

12:51.930 --> 12:53.463
Hey, where have you gone?

12:54.165 --> 12:55.798
Sophie, come on!

12:56.434 --> 12:59.304
- Hey!
- Sophie!

12:59.337 --> 13:00.737
Yo, where are you?

13:01.773 --> 13:03.773
Sophie, it's okay!

13:06.444 --> 13:09.047
Hey, come on, Sophie!

13:09.080 --> 13:10.179
She's over here.

13:11.716 --> 13:12.815
There!

13:17.455 --> 13:19.589
Get her!

13:23.561 --> 13:25.428
Come on.

13:35.707 --> 13:37.276
Grab her!

13:37.309 --> 13:38.744
Just want to talk to you.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.013
She bit me!

13:46.751 --> 13:47.984
No, Josh!

13:48.653 --> 13:50.153
No!

13:58.330 --> 13:59.598
Oh, shit.

14:19.985 --> 14:22.254
Help me.

14:22.287 --> 14:23.655
She's still breathing.

14:25.757 --> 14:28.160
- What are you doing?
- Calling 911.

14:28.193 --> 14:31.296
- And tell them what?
- There's been an accident and she needs help.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.898
What are you doing?

14:32.931 --> 14:35.098
You think they'll believe you?
What about this?

14:35.834 --> 14:37.200
What about the bite marks?

14:40.138 --> 14:43.275
How long do you think it'll take for
them to realize there was a fight?

14:43.308 --> 14:45.978
But it was an accident.
She... She tripped and fell.

14:46.011 --> 14:47.343
Right, Zach?

14:48.480 --> 14:49.679
Give me your phone.

14:53.385 --> 14:55.187
Are you all
out of your fucking minds?

14:55.220 --> 14:57.120
We need to get help!

14:59.824 --> 15:01.626
What do we do, Taylor?

15:01.659 --> 15:04.296
- I don't know.
- Are you kidding me?

15:04.329 --> 15:06.765
Half a mil on a law degree
and you don't know?

15:06.798 --> 15:08.700
This is Italy, man.
Who the fuck knows?

15:08.733 --> 15:11.503
- What about back home?
- Um...

15:11.536 --> 15:15.040
At best, the defense would be
a charge of manslaughter.

15:15.073 --> 15:19.111
But with the scratches on your face,
your skin under her fingernails,

15:19.144 --> 15:22.514
there's not a prosecutor around who
couldn't convict on a murder charge.

15:22.547 --> 15:23.715
That's 20 years in jail.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.183
I told you guys.

15:25.216 --> 15:26.985
I warned you
he would do it again.

15:27.018 --> 15:28.820
That was a long time ago!

15:31.489 --> 15:35.291
We didn't get caught then.
We're not going to get caught now.

15:40.698 --> 15:44.803
She fell from the rock doing
what she loved. Sad, but true.

15:44.836 --> 15:46.538
You mean just
leave her like this?

15:49.107 --> 15:52.175
Please. Please.

15:54.212 --> 15:55.311
No.

15:57.682 --> 15:58.781
We can't do that.

15:59.551 --> 16:00.683
What are you doing?

16:01.719 --> 16:03.853
- What does it look like I'm doing?
- No way!

16:06.357 --> 16:07.592
Listen to me.

16:07.625 --> 16:10.262
We are not going down for this.

16:10.295 --> 16:13.598
We're going to stick together
like we always do.

16:13.631 --> 16:16.799
Now you're either with us
or you're against us.

16:17.635 --> 16:19.302
So, what's it going to be?

16:25.210 --> 16:27.877
Zach? Taylor?

16:31.483 --> 16:32.751
She's still alive.

16:32.784 --> 16:33.950
Oh, no!

16:36.454 --> 16:38.023
You can't do this!

16:38.056 --> 16:39.555
Jesus Christ, no!

16:44.162 --> 16:45.931
Take it.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.363
Josh, she's already dead.

16:48.933 --> 16:50.533
Take the rock.

17:14.092 --> 17:16.025
You always were a little pussy.

17:20.965 --> 17:24.000
Well, now you're just as guilty
as the rest of us.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.272
What do we do now?

17:36.481 --> 17:37.547
Fuck.

17:50.628 --> 17:51.761
Wait.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.231
Her fingernails.

18:06.077 --> 18:09.147
You really think they're going
to believe that someone like her

18:09.180 --> 18:11.049
would try to climb that at night
without ropes?

18:11.082 --> 18:12.717
She was wasted.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.787
She was drinking all night
and getting high.

18:15.820 --> 18:18.955
Do you know how much alcohol and
weed they'll find in her body?

18:20.391 --> 18:24.896
You guys heard her. She called us
pussies for not climbing the face.

18:24.929 --> 18:28.598
Suddenly, she says she can climb the
first 50 feet faster than any of us.

18:39.944 --> 18:41.577
We tried to stop her.

18:44.716 --> 18:47.516
Nobody who's here says it
happened any other way, right?

19:00.565 --> 19:01.631
Oh, my God.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.273
What was that?

19:17.148 --> 19:19.284
It's Kelly. The camera.

19:19.317 --> 19:20.549
Get her.

19:24.989 --> 19:26.122
Go, go, go!

19:33.298 --> 19:37.369
Get the camera! Get it! Come on!

19:37.402 --> 19:39.035
No, no, no.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.170
Where is she?

19:43.908 --> 19:45.443
Kelly, wait!

19:45.476 --> 19:47.343
- Come on, come on!
- Through here! Come on!

19:48.646 --> 19:49.712
Come on!

19:50.281 --> 19:51.881
Fuck! Get her!

19:53.318 --> 19:55.217
After her! Come on!

20:02.593 --> 20:04.429
Where the fuck is she?
Where is she?

20:04.462 --> 20:05.995
Where is she?

20:10.268 --> 20:11.936
Fuck!

20:11.969 --> 20:14.439
We can't let her
leave with that camera.

20:14.472 --> 20:16.474
- Kelly!
- Go back to the camp.

20:16.507 --> 20:20.178
If you find her there,
you stop her and you wait for us.

20:20.211 --> 20:22.545
- You got that?
- Okay, okay.

20:23.114 --> 20:24.547
We split.

20:25.316 --> 20:26.985
But if you find that bitch,

20:27.018 --> 20:30.186
- you hold her, okay?
- All right.

20:31.222 --> 20:32.455
All right.

20:56.848 --> 20:58.414
It's okay.
I haven't seen you.

21:24.542 --> 21:26.308
Hey! Hey!

21:28.246 --> 21:30.146
Oh, shit! Fuck!

21:32.216 --> 21:34.283
She's going for the face!

21:44.796 --> 21:46.698
Kelly! Stop!

21:46.731 --> 21:47.763
It's over.

21:49.434 --> 21:50.699
Fuck!

21:51.436 --> 21:53.135
Kelly, you're fucking crazy!

21:54.372 --> 21:56.138
Don't do it!

21:56.908 --> 21:58.774
Oh, shit! Fuck!

22:14.959 --> 22:16.659
You get that bitch down, Taylor!

22:23.501 --> 22:25.401
Watch your step!

22:29.407 --> 22:30.506
Go on, Taylor.

22:41.686 --> 22:43.719
- Taylor!
- Guys, get the gear!

22:46.190 --> 22:47.656
Fuck this!

22:48.926 --> 22:50.226
Fuck.

22:52.864 --> 22:55.664
- Goddamn it.
- Get her down, Taylor!

23:01.205 --> 23:04.075
- Get that camera!
- Come on, man!

23:09.013 --> 23:10.713
Oh, shit...

23:11.716 --> 23:13.084
Hold on there.

23:13.117 --> 23:14.586
- Come on, Taylor.
- Shit!

23:42.413 --> 23:43.546
Yes!

23:51.055 --> 23:52.790
Oh, my God.

23:52.823 --> 23:55.157
- Looks like his leg's busted bad.
- My leg!

23:59.363 --> 24:02.033
I told you to stop
her getting back to the cabin.

24:02.066 --> 24:04.502
You don't get it, do you?
We're on that camera.

24:04.535 --> 24:07.238
We're all on that camera,
including you!

24:07.271 --> 24:08.470
Oh, God!

24:10.675 --> 24:12.810
I'm coming for you, bitch!

24:12.843 --> 24:16.679
Do you hear me?
I'm coming for you!

24:28.893 --> 24:32.461
No, no!

24:33.598 --> 24:36.401
Breathe, man, breathe.
Hey dude, keep the fire going.

24:36.434 --> 24:38.169
We can see the smoke
and know you're okay.

24:38.202 --> 24:39.904
We can't just leave him
here like this.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.437
Here, I found these
in the girls' cabin.

24:47.445 --> 24:49.581
Here, drink it.

24:49.614 --> 24:51.683
- Drink it, man.
- Josh, it's enough, man!

24:51.716 --> 24:54.452
You're going to be okay, dude.
Twenty-four hours, okay?

24:54.485 --> 24:56.287
If we're not back by then,
you call for help.

24:56.320 --> 25:00.058
You're going to be all right,
buddy. Okay. Let's go.

25:00.091 --> 25:02.558
Got to go, guys. Come on, man.

25:03.928 --> 25:05.060
Wait.

26:05.289 --> 26:07.291
<i>You're allowed
to have fun, Kel.</i>

26:08.392 --> 26:09.725
Get off me!

26:34.985 --> 26:37.386
She's too high
to come back down without ropes.

26:40.224 --> 26:41.492
Guys.

26:41.525 --> 26:44.696
Look what I found.
It's her phone.

26:44.729 --> 26:46.662
- Toss it.
- It's still working.

26:53.838 --> 26:58.142
They said they were going to climb up
the face. None of us can climb that.

26:58.175 --> 27:00.712
You know how cold
it's going to be up there?

27:00.745 --> 27:02.980
She's already lost
half her equipment.

27:03.013 --> 27:06.482
If she doesn't fall, she'll freeze
to death before we even get up there.

27:09.687 --> 27:11.489
Let's climb to the shoulder

27:11.522 --> 27:14.123
and take the trail around
the back so we're above her.

27:15.126 --> 27:16.425
She'll have nowhere to go.

27:21.365 --> 27:23.165
Shit, I left my gloves
back at the cabin.

27:24.368 --> 27:25.667
You two wait here.

27:38.215 --> 27:41.686
Zach, listen to me. We can
tell them the truth about what happened,

27:41.719 --> 27:44.856
that Josh killed her and she was
already dead when we dropped her.

27:44.889 --> 27:48.526
What about the bite marks on my hand?
They'll know something happened.

27:48.559 --> 27:51.095
Well, she bit you because
Josh made you go after her.

27:51.128 --> 27:54.866
He says all this stuff about us being in
it together, but if it wasn't for him,

27:54.899 --> 27:56.934
none of this shit would be
happening in the first place.

27:56.967 --> 27:58.970
How long have we all
known each other?

27:59.003 --> 28:00.905
I don't remember you complaining
when Mikey Edwards

28:00.938 --> 28:02.874
was beating your ass
in the schoolyard.

28:02.907 --> 28:06.444
Who was it who stood up
for you then? Josh.

28:06.477 --> 28:09.080
That was in the third grade,
for Christ's sake.

28:09.113 --> 28:11.480
We're only here because we
don't have the balls not to be.

28:15.252 --> 28:16.652
You know, I saw him,

28:17.655 --> 28:19.488
when I went back home
for Christmas.

28:20.524 --> 28:23.060
He can't walk anymore, man.

28:23.093 --> 28:26.097
He sucks his food up through a straw,
all because of what we did to him.

28:26.130 --> 28:28.566
You need to cut that shit out.

28:28.599 --> 28:31.066
You heard what Taylor said.
Twenty years?

28:33.971 --> 28:35.871
We got away with it then.
We'll get away with it now.

28:37.608 --> 28:40.042
Now keep your mouth shut
and stick to the fucking plan.

28:46.350 --> 28:47.883
Where the hell is he?

29:02.967 --> 29:04.936
I thought I told you to wait.

29:04.969 --> 29:06.201
Did you get them?

29:07.037 --> 29:08.270
The gloves?

29:11.041 --> 29:12.241
Let's go.

29:15.246 --> 29:16.478
Come on!

29:42.006 --> 29:45.009
<i>Climbing is like
chess mixed with ballet.</i>

29:45.042 --> 29:46.510
It's all a game.

29:46.543 --> 29:48.911
Use your mind, not your muscles.

33:18.655 --> 33:19.788
Fuck!

33:35.739 --> 33:38.006
Oh! That is so good!

33:54.591 --> 33:56.925
Hey, I got
your follow request, Kelly!

33:59.429 --> 34:02.299
I hope you're not one of these
stalkers I've been reading about.

34:02.332 --> 34:08.036
"Met some cute guys climbing.

34:08.705 --> 34:12.107
Josh is really hot!"

34:13.343 --> 34:15.179
Oh!

34:15.212 --> 34:17.546
I got a DM from Kelly!

34:19.316 --> 34:20.751
She thinks I'm hot!

34:20.784 --> 34:22.417
Fuck you!

34:22.886 --> 34:24.553
Thanks, Kelly!

34:57.487 --> 35:01.192
Whoo! You go, Kelly!

35:01.225 --> 35:04.559
Only a few thousand feet
to climb!

35:15.939 --> 35:17.138
He's crazy.

38:37.107 --> 38:40.344
- You're doing great.
- Whoo!

38:40.377 --> 38:41.543
Yes!

40:11.902 --> 40:14.702
<i>Use your mind,
not your muscles.</i>

40:23.513 --> 40:24.746
Fuck!

40:30.854 --> 40:32.453
Where is she?

40:42.532 --> 40:43.965
Is that you, Kelly?

40:48.838 --> 40:50.271
Can you hear me?

40:55.011 --> 40:56.844
What took you so long?

41:06.022 --> 41:08.156
All we want is that camera.

41:12.128 --> 41:13.928
We're going to throw
a rope down.

41:14.931 --> 41:17.834
- Take it.
- You tie the camera to the rope

41:17.867 --> 41:20.201
and nobody's going
to get hurt, okay?

41:44.094 --> 41:46.394
Last chance, Kelly!

42:37.447 --> 42:38.680
Hey, hey.

42:43.219 --> 42:45.586
I knew you'd see sense, Kelly.

42:52.962 --> 42:55.430
Well, if this
is the way you want it!

42:58.535 --> 42:59.767
What do we do now?

43:01.071 --> 43:03.206
She's trapped.

43:03.239 --> 43:06.808
She can't come up and she can't go down.
She's lost all her kit.

43:08.511 --> 43:09.711
So we wait.

43:50.787 --> 43:52.253
There's no smoke.

43:57.794 --> 44:00.597
You know,
even if we get that camera,

44:00.630 --> 44:02.430
she's still a witness,
don't you?

44:03.700 --> 44:05.836
What are you saying?

44:05.869 --> 44:08.205
I'm saying he's not going to
let her off this mountain alive,

44:08.238 --> 44:10.271
that he came up here
to kill her.

44:11.274 --> 44:13.510
He's a psycho, man.

44:13.543 --> 44:16.043
We knew it then
and we know it now.

44:17.413 --> 44:19.180
He was 16 years old.

44:21.451 --> 44:24.318
You know what was in my brother's
coffin when they flew him back home?

44:25.421 --> 44:29.290
Sandbags filled with
the same shit sand he died on.

44:32.996 --> 44:35.132
It's what they do when they
can't find enough of the body

44:35.165 --> 44:37.768
to make the crate
feel heavy enough.

44:37.801 --> 44:41.304
And then Taylor's sister
starts dating some raghead,

44:41.337 --> 44:44.074
- and you think we were gonna let that slide?
- He was just a kid.

44:44.107 --> 44:48.111
Whether he was a kid or not,
you were there with us.

44:48.144 --> 44:51.148
You beat the crap out of him.
You threw him in the back of that truck.

44:51.181 --> 44:53.648
You dumped him on the street
the same as we did.

44:54.818 --> 44:57.420
We did it for Taylor
and my brother,

44:57.453 --> 44:59.156
because that's what friends do.

44:59.189 --> 45:00.688
So, we just kill her?

46:42.358 --> 46:45.626
We need to call Taylor,
see what's happening down there.

46:46.429 --> 46:48.598
- Can't do that.
- Why not?

46:48.631 --> 46:50.867
Because they'll
check our phone records.

46:50.900 --> 46:53.770
And the story is
we're climbing up here together.

46:53.803 --> 46:56.671
Nobody does anything until we
get that camera, understand?

47:36.346 --> 47:37.712
Hey, look at this.

47:44.420 --> 47:46.921
You must be really hungry
after that climb.

47:49.826 --> 47:52.159
Why don't you come and join us?

48:19.055 --> 48:21.188
Don't worry, I've got you.

48:31.501 --> 48:33.670
Hey, look at this.

48:33.703 --> 48:36.270
She tried to climb the mountain
before but didn't make it.

48:37.073 --> 48:39.042
It looks like he fell.

48:39.075 --> 48:42.443
Look, see the day it was taken?
It was one year ago tomorrow.

48:43.479 --> 48:45.148
That's why she's here.

48:45.181 --> 48:47.248
She's climbing
in the memory of him.

49:31.761 --> 49:34.028
Nighty night, Kelly!

49:35.364 --> 49:37.331
You sleep tight, you hear?

50:21.511 --> 50:23.511
Hey, Kelly!

50:25.515 --> 50:29.886
I almost forgot
to say happy anniversary!

50:29.919 --> 50:32.589
What a shame that Luca
couldn't be here,

50:32.622 --> 50:35.089
but he's just so dead!

51:08.824 --> 51:10.457
Wakey wakey, Kelly.

51:35.818 --> 51:36.917
Pull it up.

51:40.156 --> 51:41.255
It's caught on something.

51:45.561 --> 51:47.628
Let go. Drop it, drop it.

51:49.932 --> 51:54.635
Give me the knife. I've tried to be nice, Kelly.

51:56.872 --> 51:58.939
But now you're
just pissing me off!

52:31.807 --> 52:33.941
<i>You can do this, Kelly.</i>

53:37.606 --> 53:38.741
<i>Nice.</i>

53:40.843 --> 53:41.942
Ooh!

53:45.114 --> 53:47.047
Yeah! Oh my God.

53:48.050 --> 53:51.354
- I'm shaking.
- Proud of you, Kelly.

54:34.930 --> 54:37.700
We've got you now.
Where's the camera?

54:37.733 --> 54:39.233
Give it to me!

54:40.369 --> 54:41.602
Where's the camera?

54:42.338 --> 54:44.171
I said, where's the camera?

54:46.575 --> 54:48.075
It's in the bag!
It's in the bag!

55:03.959 --> 55:06.360
Zach,
what's going on down there?

55:16.872 --> 55:19.173
- Josh!
- Zach?

55:23.712 --> 55:25.281
Zach, what's going on, man?

55:25.314 --> 55:27.283
You tell him
we're both on this rope.

55:27.316 --> 55:29.252
He's going to cut it
and kill us both.

55:29.285 --> 55:31.421
So, what now?

55:31.454 --> 55:33.856
You're going to have
to swing me back to the wall.

55:33.889 --> 55:35.889
Zach? Come on, man!

55:38.260 --> 55:40.430
- Pull me up!
- No!

55:42.331 --> 55:43.900
Pull me up! Pull me up!

55:43.933 --> 55:46.867
- Pull the rope!
- Go!

55:47.470 --> 55:48.938
Go!

55:48.971 --> 55:50.039
- No!
- Pull it, man!

55:50.072 --> 55:51.274
Josh!

55:51.307 --> 55:53.340
- No!
- Go!

55:55.578 --> 55:57.878
Keep hold of that bitch!

56:08.958 --> 56:10.760
Oh, God!

56:28.177 --> 56:29.843
Holy shit!

56:36.385 --> 56:38.120
- Did you get the camera?
- No!

56:38.153 --> 56:40.587
Fuck. Fuck!

57:36.912 --> 57:38.812
Where the fuck
are the painkillers?

57:40.449 --> 57:41.582
Fuck.

57:46.422 --> 57:48.925
Go to Italy, bang some chicks,

57:48.958 --> 57:51.394
get high and climb a rock.

57:51.427 --> 57:52.929
That's what you said.

57:52.962 --> 57:55.264
We have to stop this thing now.

57:55.297 --> 57:57.733
She can't come up and she'll
never make it back down.

57:57.766 --> 58:01.037
When she falls,
the camera falls with her

58:01.070 --> 58:02.505
and it'll be smashed to pieces.

58:02.538 --> 58:04.540
It'll look like
they both just fell.

58:04.573 --> 58:06.442
We say Taylor fell with them

58:06.475 --> 58:08.878
and snapped his leg,
but he managed to hold on,

58:08.911 --> 58:10.877
and we carried him
back to the cabin.

58:11.580 --> 58:12.980
And you agree with him?

58:16.485 --> 58:17.618
Okay.

58:18.821 --> 58:21.424
This is a democracy,
after all.

58:21.457 --> 58:23.557
We head back down
at first light.

58:25.394 --> 58:27.828
I'll call Amy and tell her
there's been an accident.

58:28.831 --> 58:29.963
She'll send help.

58:49.151 --> 58:51.485
<i>I think I'm going
to take you to Antelao.</i>

58:52.488 --> 58:53.789
You mean the Dolomites?

58:53.822 --> 58:55.322
Yeah, you're ready.

58:57.860 --> 58:58.992
Maybe.

59:19.014 --> 59:20.213
Reynolds.

59:22.851 --> 59:25.921
You've got to get me off this
mountain before I bleed to death, man.

59:25.954 --> 59:28.357
Taylor will have called
for help by now.

59:28.390 --> 59:31.193
We said 24 hours, remember?
They should be here soon.

59:31.226 --> 59:33.393
We've got to get off
this mountain on our own.

59:34.363 --> 59:36.165
What do you mean?

59:36.198 --> 59:38.765
You know when Josh went back
to the cabin to get his gloves?

59:40.035 --> 59:42.469
I think he went back there
and killed Taylor.

59:44.473 --> 59:47.643
You know what he said
about calling Amy for help?

59:47.676 --> 59:50.846
He hasn't spoken to her for six months.
Why would he call her now?

59:50.879 --> 59:53.049
Well, I thought you said
they were engaged.

59:53.082 --> 59:55.785
She caught him cheating on her.

59:55.818 --> 59:58.621
She was in town picking out
a wedding dress.

59:58.654 --> 1:00:01.755
She sees him going into a hotel
with some blonde.

1:00:02.891 --> 1:00:04.527
Turns out they meet there
every week,

1:00:04.560 --> 1:00:07.260
checking in as man and wife
for the past two years.

1:00:09.198 --> 1:00:12.201
She tells her father
who's already 30 million down

1:00:12.234 --> 1:00:13.934
from Josh's fuck-ups
at the firm.

1:00:15.404 --> 1:00:17.604
He's been kicked out
of the house, man.

1:00:18.273 --> 1:00:19.840
There is no wedding.

1:00:21.710 --> 1:00:24.978
Look, if I'm right, he'll have
Taylor's phone in his pack.

1:00:26.448 --> 1:00:28.014
Nobody's coming, man.

1:00:28.884 --> 1:00:30.753
It's up to you
to get us out of here.

1:00:30.786 --> 1:00:32.119
How?

1:00:33.922 --> 1:00:35.157
The watch.

1:00:35.190 --> 1:00:36.926
The emergency beacon.

1:00:36.959 --> 1:00:39.161
You've got to get to it.
Send a signal.

1:00:39.194 --> 1:00:43.566
- We don't even know if that thing works.
- Look, I'm dying here, man.

1:00:43.599 --> 1:00:46.800
And he's going to kill you too
if you don't do something.

1:01:28.944 --> 1:01:31.580
If you wanted to know the time
you could have just asked.

1:01:34.283 --> 1:01:36.750
Josh, that's enough, man!

1:01:37.786 --> 1:01:39.319
Josh! Stop it!

1:01:48.297 --> 1:01:50.399
You Judas prick son of a bitch.

1:01:50.432 --> 1:01:52.334
You think I don't hear
you two gossiping?

1:01:52.367 --> 1:01:54.568
You choose her over me?

1:01:56.038 --> 1:01:58.941
She's just a whore
like the rest of them.

1:01:58.974 --> 1:02:05.114
There isn't a single woman alive with a
loyal fucking bone in their entire body.

1:02:05.147 --> 1:02:07.414
Am I right, Zach? Tell him.

1:02:09.351 --> 1:02:10.750
Oh, that's right.

1:02:11.653 --> 1:02:13.386
You don't even know.

1:02:15.190 --> 1:02:17.526
What are you talking about?

1:02:17.559 --> 1:02:20.460
I'm talking about this chick
I've been banging since college.

1:02:21.396 --> 1:02:24.266
Boyfriend doesn't know
a thing about it.

1:02:24.299 --> 1:02:26.535
We meet at the hotel around
the corner from their place,

1:02:26.568 --> 1:02:29.636
when he thinks
she's doing Pilates

1:02:30.706 --> 1:02:34.276
every Friday night.

1:02:34.309 --> 1:02:37.880
That's how he thinks she's
keeping that ass of hers in shape,

1:02:37.913 --> 1:02:40.115
when the truth is,
I'm holding a pillow over her head

1:02:40.148 --> 1:02:42.651
and banging that
tight little peach.

1:02:42.684 --> 1:02:44.951
You know what
the funniest part of it is?

1:02:45.721 --> 1:02:48.023
She tells him she hates me,

1:02:48.056 --> 1:02:50.726
can't stand to have me
in the house.

1:02:50.759 --> 1:02:54.830
- And that way he doesn't suspect a thing.
- You son of a bitch.

1:02:54.863 --> 1:02:58.298
How else do you think Jessica
learned to be so good at blow jobs?

1:03:08.076 --> 1:03:09.809
You knew about this?

1:03:10.779 --> 1:03:12.012
And Taylor?

1:03:14.449 --> 1:03:16.316
What, so you
all knew except me?

1:03:17.686 --> 1:03:20.222
What were you all doing?
Laughing behind my back?

1:03:20.255 --> 1:03:22.522
- It wasn't like that.
- Then what was it like?

1:03:25.861 --> 1:03:27.327
You're supposed to be my friend.

1:03:32.768 --> 1:03:35.435
Hey, bitch! Can you hear me?

1:03:36.571 --> 1:03:39.108
You fucked my buddy up
pretty good.

1:03:39.141 --> 1:03:42.278
I mean, a girl's got to do
what a girl's got to do

1:03:42.311 --> 1:03:46.046
in this world to survive,
but that shit's fucked up.

1:03:47.783 --> 1:03:49.482
Is it money you want?

1:03:50.585 --> 1:03:52.588
A girl like you would have
to be down on her knees

1:03:52.621 --> 1:03:55.090
sucking cock for
the next 50 years

1:03:55.123 --> 1:03:57.324
to earn the kind of money
we could give you.

1:03:58.660 --> 1:04:00.860
How much do you want
for that camera, huh?

1:04:02.431 --> 1:04:04.066
200 grand?

1:04:04.099 --> 1:04:05.498
Half a mil?

1:04:06.234 --> 1:04:08.134
Everybody has a price.

1:04:09.104 --> 1:04:11.740
You could be
on a beach somewhere,

1:04:11.773 --> 1:04:15.008
topping up that tan,
forget this ever happened.

1:04:23.919 --> 1:04:29.522
Okay, then. When the shit hits the
fan, don't forget I tried to be nice.

1:06:03.051 --> 1:06:03.983
Zach?

1:06:07.789 --> 1:06:09.989
- Where's Zach?
- Took the trail down.

1:06:12.060 --> 1:06:14.260
Said he could make it there
by first light.

1:06:15.730 --> 1:06:18.200
Soon as he gets to Taylor,
he'll make the call

1:06:18.233 --> 1:06:19.599
and get someone up here.

1:06:22.137 --> 1:06:23.503
I called Amy.

1:06:25.373 --> 1:06:27.774
Told her there had been
an accident but we were okay.

1:06:30.645 --> 1:06:32.479
It's just you and me now, buddy.

1:06:34.416 --> 1:06:36.316
We have to finish this
before they get here.

1:06:55.003 --> 1:06:56.202
I'll go.

1:06:58.240 --> 1:07:00.442
You don't send a boy
to do a man's job.

1:07:00.475 --> 1:07:02.778
She knows you're going
down there to kill her.

1:07:02.811 --> 1:07:05.547
That means she isn't going
to give you that camera.

1:07:05.580 --> 1:07:08.550
I'll tell her we'll follow
Zachary back down the trail.

1:07:08.583 --> 1:07:12.121
When we get to the bottom,
it'll be her word against the four of us.

1:07:12.154 --> 1:07:14.490
And when I get close enough,

1:07:14.523 --> 1:07:15.655
I'll kill her.

1:07:17.826 --> 1:07:19.225
Give me the hammer.

1:07:20.795 --> 1:07:22.162
The hammer!

1:07:46.655 --> 1:07:49.791
Hey, hey, I'm not going to hurt you.

1:07:49.824 --> 1:07:53.560
I'm not going to hurt you.
I... I brought you some food.

1:08:06.208 --> 1:08:07.807
I'm sorry about your friend.

1:08:10.011 --> 1:08:12.548
- You killed her.
- I didn't kill her.

1:08:12.581 --> 1:08:14.550
Josh hit her and she fell
and hit her head.

1:08:14.583 --> 1:08:16.718
It was his idea
to throw her off that ledge

1:08:16.751 --> 1:08:19.821
- and make it look like she fell.
- Why would I believe you?

1:08:19.854 --> 1:08:22.958
Because I'm your only chance
of getting out of here alive.

1:08:22.991 --> 1:08:25.992
You know he's going to kill you unless
you give him what he wants, don't you?

1:08:26.995 --> 1:08:29.364
Give me the camera.
I'll say I grabbed it

1:08:29.397 --> 1:08:30.930
and pushed you off the mountain.

1:08:31.866 --> 1:08:34.136
Zachary, the guy
you attacked yesterday.

1:08:34.169 --> 1:08:35.904
He's gone back down the trail.

1:08:35.937 --> 1:08:38.071
He'll get help.
He'll tell them you're up here.

1:08:40.108 --> 1:08:41.507
Your friend,

1:08:42.444 --> 1:08:44.513
he's not going to tell
anybody anything.

1:08:44.546 --> 1:08:46.582
What are you talking about?

1:08:46.615 --> 1:08:48.014
He's dead.

1:08:49.351 --> 1:08:51.420
I saw his body
drop from that ledge.

1:08:51.453 --> 1:08:53.319
That's a lie.

1:08:54.022 --> 1:08:57.924
I stabbed a knife in his leg.

1:08:59.094 --> 1:09:01.294
Do you really think he got up
and walked out of here?

1:09:02.430 --> 1:09:05.865
Bet you didn't see him leave,
did you?

1:09:07.269 --> 1:09:09.168
And do you know what that means?

1:09:10.038 --> 1:09:12.007
That means you're next.

1:09:12.040 --> 1:09:15.441
So, it really doesn't matter whether
I give you the camera or not.

1:09:16.978 --> 1:09:21.583
Because he's going to kill me.
And then he's going to kill you.

1:09:21.616 --> 1:09:24.686
If you don't give me the camera, he's
gonna come down here and get it himself.

1:09:24.719 --> 1:09:26.052
Is that what you want?

1:09:33.428 --> 1:09:34.527
Okay.

1:09:51.913 --> 1:09:53.646
Now scream.

1:09:55.417 --> 1:09:56.985
If you don't scream,

1:09:57.018 --> 1:09:58.885
I'll have to make you scream.

1:10:04.159 --> 1:10:05.758
What's going on down there?

1:10:10.465 --> 1:10:12.234
- Pull me up.
- Did you get the camera?

1:10:12.267 --> 1:10:13.468
- Pull me up!
- Did you get it?

1:10:13.501 --> 1:10:14.434
I got it!

1:10:15.637 --> 1:10:17.906
- Let me see it.
- What is wrong with you? I got it!

1:10:17.939 --> 1:10:19.272
What about her?

1:10:20.141 --> 1:10:21.341
It's over.

1:10:21.976 --> 1:10:23.412
I didn't see her.

1:10:23.445 --> 1:10:26.415
Hey, I said I'd take care
of it and I did.

1:10:26.448 --> 1:10:27.680
Now pull me up!

1:10:38.993 --> 1:10:40.293
Give me the camera.

1:10:48.503 --> 1:10:50.005
Where's the memory card?

1:10:50.038 --> 1:10:52.872
- The memory card isn't in the camera.
- What?

1:10:53.541 --> 1:10:55.043
She must have taken it out.

1:10:55.076 --> 1:10:56.609
Kidding me!

1:11:02.417 --> 1:11:05.485
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Taylor.

1:11:24.906 --> 1:11:26.672
Oh, God!

1:11:49.397 --> 1:11:52.167
Josh, what... No, what the...

1:11:52.200 --> 1:11:53.769
No, no, Josh.

1:11:53.802 --> 1:11:58.371
- No. Josh, no.
- I'm sending you a gift, Kelly!

1:11:59.073 --> 1:12:00.609
I hope you like it.

1:12:00.642 --> 1:12:03.578
No, no!

1:12:03.611 --> 1:12:06.615
Fireworks for your anniversary,
Kelly!

1:12:06.648 --> 1:12:08.350
Oh, God!

1:13:11.713 --> 1:13:13.546
Oh...

1:13:34.869 --> 1:13:36.638
No!

1:13:36.671 --> 1:13:38.137
No!

1:14:00.695 --> 1:14:02.295
<i>Come on, Kelly.</i>

1:14:19.781 --> 1:14:21.314
Time's up, Kelly.

1:16:09.824 --> 1:16:11.292
It's over.

1:16:11.325 --> 1:16:13.261
Now give me the card
and I'll make it quick.

1:16:13.294 --> 1:16:16.362
You're never, ever
getting that card.

1:16:19.834 --> 1:16:22.368
Give me the card!

1:16:26.474 --> 1:16:29.010
It doesn't matter
what you do to me,

1:16:29.043 --> 1:16:31.680
because I've hidden it
somewhere on this wall.

1:16:31.713 --> 1:16:33.779
And one day,
someone's going to find it.

1:16:47.662 --> 1:16:49.128
I'll make a trade with you.

1:16:50.898 --> 1:16:53.499
The card for the ring.

1:16:55.103 --> 1:16:56.569
Now, where is it?

1:16:58.406 --> 1:17:00.106
It's in a hole
in the wall over there.

1:17:01.209 --> 1:17:03.109
I've hidden it in a bag inside.

1:17:05.613 --> 1:17:07.580
You'd better not
be fucking with me.

1:17:17.191 --> 1:17:18.924
Bitch!

1:17:50.224 --> 1:17:51.860
Please.

1:17:51.893 --> 1:17:53.192
Please, help me.

1:17:53.995 --> 1:17:55.161
Help me!

1:17:58.132 --> 1:17:59.198
Help me.

1:18:31.532 --> 1:18:33.232
Now it's your turn.

1:19:41.269 --> 1:19:43.102
<i>Kelly, it's time.</i>
