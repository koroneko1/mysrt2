00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Did you know that that man was a bad guy?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Sometimes I had to do the things that good people don't do.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.000
let me be your choice too. 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.000
If you are in trouble, my father can help you.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:25.700
Who is your father?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
You shouldn't know about it. 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.000
The two of us can be friends and that's enough.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.700
Stop. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Don't move the body anywhere.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.000
The person who died was a relative of my worker.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.000
He suspected the death of his nephew. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This is not Dong's body. 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.000
If it's not Dong's body, whose body is this?

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.000
Anyway, I need to bring the body back to check to see what happened.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.000
If there's a progress, I will immediately inform you all.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm rich today. It's my treat. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Dong's uncle.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Why is he wealthy now?

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
So how did you handle Dong's body?

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.000
The people in the kitchen collecting mushrooms and the workers are there. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.000
It wouldn't be that easy to dig up Dong's body.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.000
But we have to find a way to get rid of the body.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.000
I'll go back and deal with it again soon.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.000
I will find a way to handle that body. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The warehouse at the temple was completely burned down?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.000
Yes, sir. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I assumed that the area was bombed last night.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.000
The area has been ravaged by flames. 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.000
All corpses that were kept were burned. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
What about the corpse taken for verification?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
They all caught fire. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Then we can't prove

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
whose body is it?

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Since the corpse is burned, we can't find any evidence against them, right?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Yes. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
I don't know where did they make merit.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Why are they always lucky?

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.000
No matter what plan I made, they can get away with it all the time. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
I don't know how they could destroy the evidence?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
The evidence is no longer there.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.000
What should we do next?

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Even if they have a hundred gods protecting them, 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.000
I won't give up.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
How can I let the culprit get away

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
without doing anything?

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
You're here in the account room.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.000
That's why I couldn't find you in the office.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
What's the matter?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Look at this. 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.000
This is the latest account of this month.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.000
Every business have sent the balance to let Five Dragons Association check.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
And this.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
These are some copies that I copied from several merchants

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
that we do business with.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
The balances didn't match.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Tian.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Is there anything else?

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.000
No. 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.000
Purchase orders and the balance reported to the association that didn't match

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.000
all belong to Mr. Ma. 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000
This means Mr. Ma is playing tricks on us.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Xiaotong. 

00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000
You let someone call me to come here,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
what's the matter?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I heard that the night when the bomb dropped, 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000
the body that had been swapped with Dong's was completely burned, right?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Right. 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
The police can't do anything right now

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:17.000
because there is no evidence.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
No evidence?

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:22.000
But I think this story won't end easily, Big Brother.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Ma would probably dig up this matter over and over. 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
I'm worried about you so I invited you to come here today.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I'd like you to meet someone.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Who?

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000
Guys. 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Where are you taking me to?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Mr. Song. 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Big brother, what's the matter?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Why do you call us to an urgent meeting like this?

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Wait for Ma to come here, 

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000
we'll listen about it together.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Big Brother, Chun.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Xiaotong. 

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I came late again as usual today. 

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Let's start the meeting.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Bring him in.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
What is this?

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.000
Big brother, why did you bring Zhan here?

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Zhan.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000
How were you related to Dong's death?

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Tell me the truth. 

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I received money from Mr. Ma. 

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
In fact, I wasn't a relative of Dong.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000
We've once lived in the same village. That's all. 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Mr. Ma wanted this to hurt you, Sir. 

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
And he'll take the opportunity to become the head of the Five Dragons Association.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.000
He's lying. 

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000
He told me that he was Dong's relative.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
He asked me to help investigate his death.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
How dare you?

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Slandering me, huh? Idiot.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:10.000
That's enough.

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.000
Bastard.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Big Brother, he lied. 

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
He's mad that I paid him less.

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:21.000
Bastard.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000
I have a doubt.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000
I want to know if anyone else know about this.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Because this is domestic matter.

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.000
Only the insiders will know.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Zhan.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Has anyone collaborated with you?

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.000
I'm not sure, but I heard that…

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
A madam has told us. 

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.000
Is it Madam Chan?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Is this woman?

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Let go of me. 

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Chan has nothing to do with it.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Have you forgotten that the area that I am in charge of

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:21.000
includes a coffin shop?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000
The employees at the shop were talking about Dong's death

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.000
because he learned the secret of Tian.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
What is the secret?

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:31.000
And what did he know?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Why did you have to shut his mouth?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
There's no such secret.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:39.000
And I didn't kill Dong. 

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
You denied, then I deny as well. 

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.000
There is no evidence for this matter. The end. 

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000
Tian, Yang, where are you going?

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000
What are the stuff you are carrying?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Come with me.

00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.000
Be careful.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Big Brother, I think this starts to get out of hands.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Give me some time. I will find evidence to prove myself

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.000
that Zhan is slandering me. 

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Don't make judgments about things that don't have evidence.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
It will destroy the relationship between us, 

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Five Dragons Association.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000
What if there is evidence for other matter?

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
We found the association's accounting documents.

00:13:21.300 --> 00:13:22.000
There are many points that do not match.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Most businesses in question all belong to Mr. Ma. 

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Do you say that I'm cheating?

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000
If it isn't, 

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000
please explain about it. 

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:55.000
This is a coffee business account document sent to the association.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.000
It can be seen that there is a consistent income every year.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
But when checking from the total amount from the copies of the merchant's order, 

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
you can see that there are many points that don't match.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Tian. 

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Let me see it. 

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Here, Father, this page.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Where? 

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Ma. 

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000
You ordered more products

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000
and sold for a profit without deducting money to the association?

00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.000
That's not true. 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
I wouldn't do that.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000
You can deny it.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000
If this evidence is not enough, 

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I'll find more evidence and uncover everything as soon as possible.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Sir. 

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Traders should be honest and do what they promise.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
If you prioritize your own benefit like this, 

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
no one will respect you in the future. 

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:09.000
Tian! / Stop!

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Ma, move back

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
and listen to me carefully. 

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000
Until Tian finds more evidence, 

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I will let Xiaotong 

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000
take care of all coffee businesses instead.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000
As for the opening of the furniture rental shop that you've proposed last time, 

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I will make Xiaotong take responsibility as well. 

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Big Brother!

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:59.000
Big Brother, thanks for the opportunity.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000
I will take care of all Ma's works as best as I can.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Ma. 

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Don't be angry with me. 

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
My heart almost stopped just now, Madam. 

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:46.000
Yeah, I thought I would be in trouble. 

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Mr. Ma is a good man actually. 

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
He didn't blame us. 

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
What's the matter? Knock on the door first next time. 

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.000
No manners. 

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Mr. Song and Madam Li call for you.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
What's the matter, Sir?

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Ma has informed the authorities about Dong's death. 

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Do you know anything about it?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
I don't know.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:51.000
If you don't know, then why would someone like Ma defended you?

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.000
Don't accuse me.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000
No one defend me at all. 

00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:58.000
And I really don't know about this. 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000
And how could Ma know about this?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
If you didn't tell Ma, 

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Then why would you meddle in Dong's funeral in the first place?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
At the temple, 

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
you were the one who tell everyone you got a nightmare.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Saying you wanted everyone to go to the temple to make merit for Dong.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000
When it was cremation time, you stalled like you were waiting for someone to come.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.000
When we opened the coffin, the body decayed and no one wanted to see it.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
You focused on it.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Until you were sure that it might not be Dong's body.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Is this the one who said that she didn't know anything, Sir. 

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Don't listen to her. 

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Just a mere speculation, no evidence. 

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
And if there is evidence, 

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:52.000
How do you want me to punish you?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Answer me, Chan.

00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:02.000
I don't know.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.000
I didn't do it. How can there be evidence?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:10.000
Right, there is no evidence.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000
But if something like this happens again, 

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000
you prepare to get out of here.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
I won't care about any evidence no more.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Who made the Song family in trouble, 

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
I wouldn't let that person survive. 

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Tian. 

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Do you dare to have a fight with me?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.000
You will soon know that the person who thought of being my enemy, 

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000
will meet what kind of ending.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Goddamn punk. 

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Mother, I brought you some drink and snacks.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Please have some.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
I didn't arrive in time, but I heard from Uncle Bao that

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
it was Mr. Ma who did all these.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.000
Letting someone else pretend to be Dong's relative

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:24.000
and ruining our family's reputation.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
I'm sorry

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.000
that I previously kept blaming and had doubts in you. 

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
It's okay. 

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Dong's matter is over.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Now Mr. Ma must be very angry with us.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
And now you are interfering with Mr. Ma's fraud. 

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:00.000
You have to be very careful.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Yes, Mother. 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
I'll be careful. Don't worry.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000
You can't stop me from worrying about you.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
But no matter what, 

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000
I will protect you. 

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000
And I want you to know that

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
everything I do, 

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
or what I forbid you from doing whatever you want, 

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000
I did it for you. 

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
I love you, Mother. 

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Bitch. 

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
I really want to kill her. Why does Heaven always take sides with her?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000
But a woman like me won't give up easily.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
I heard that Dad punished you and won't let you cause any more trouble.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
And this time he was very angry.

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.000
He seems very serious.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Have you seen what Mr. Ma is like?

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
He didn't blame you this time

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000
because he may keep you for any use in the future. 

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.000
I don't want you to be at a disadvantage. 

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
But you want to see me being inferior to Madam Li for the rest of your life?

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.000
Huh?

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000
You saw that she was always oppressing me.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.000
So am I wrong that I want to have some power as well?

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
What I do, 

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
I'm not doing it for myself, I'm doing it for you. Remember it. 

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.000
I know, I've always known.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:22.000
You've been talking to me since I was a child.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:23.000
Right. 

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000
You never helped me.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000
So I have to find my own way.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
What are you doing?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000
If Tian has a secret, 

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
I'll use this secret against him. 

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000
I believe that what he is hiding must be evil.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.000
Otherwise Madam Li wouldn't have killed Dong to cover up. 

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
It wasn't as bad as you thought.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
You know Tian's secret?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Yang, talk to me. 

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.000
You knew it, right? Yang, Yang.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Yang, Yang. Wait. 

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000
I told you I had nothing to say.

00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.000
Yang, wait a minute. You're lying. 

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
I know you know Tian's secret.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Otherwise how could you say it that what I thought was wrong?

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.000
I said it so that you would stop thinking bad about Tian.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Mom, he has always been good to me.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
No matter what you think about him, he never thought of hating on us. 

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Are you really able to hurt someone like this?

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000
He's nice to you because he knows that no matter what he does, 

00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:40.000
you will be by his side. 

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.000
Yes. 

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
No matter what, I will be beside Tian.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000
You knew this now. Then stop asking about his secret.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.000
Yang. 

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.000
I believe and I am confident

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
that Tian is the person who deserves 

00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.000
to inherit the position from Father.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
And nothing will change that. 

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Yang, Yang. 

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
I'll find a way for you let you reveal the secret.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.000
Wait and see. 

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Did you manage to handle Dong's body well?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:21.000
I still can't find a way to do it. 

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
The workers are there every day.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
But don't worry, Madam. I will find a way to deal with it as quickly as possible.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
If this still can't be handled, I am still worried. 

00:25:49.000 --> 00:26:50.000
And if this is revealed, 
307
00:26:51,000 --&gt; 00:25:55,000
Tian's secret that we're struggling to hide may be exposed again.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Tian's secret?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
What is his secret?

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Bua. 

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.000
When have you been here? Why didn't you call us?

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000
I just arrived and I dropped the stuff accidentally.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Madam, I went to buy more needles and threads.

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.000
Last time, I thought that your embroidery has only few colors. 

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Didn't you hear anything?

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Hear? What did I hear?

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Madam, are you alright?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.000
Nothing. Thank you very much for these needles.

00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:46.000
Yes, Madam. Please excuse me.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
She didn't hear what we talked about, right?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
What are today's dishes?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Why are there only mushrooms?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.000
What mushrooms? Where did you get them?

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
These mushroom grow at the backyard. 

00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.000
A lot of them just came out a few days ago.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:53.000
I've tried it and it tasted good.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
We have eaten them for many meals already and we aren't tired at all.

00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.000
So I want you to try some as well. 

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Mushrooms from Dong's body. 

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
It looks very tasty and plump.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Let's eat together, sit down. 

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Wow.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Li, come on, let's eat.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
You can eat it, it's not dangerous.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Come here. Li. 

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Quickly. 

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Then…

00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.000
let me try it. 

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.000
I'd like to know if it is worth the rumor.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Tian, don't eat!

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Why?

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
I...

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
I'm afraid it's a poisonous mushroom.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000
It isn't, Madam. 

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.000
We've collected to cook for many meals. We're still fine. 

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
It's really delicious.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Try it, Li. 

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Try some.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Here. 

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Give it a try.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
It's okay, I don't like mushrooms.

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:09.000
It's really delicious.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Mother. 

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.000
Mother. / Madam. 

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
What's wrong? It's just a mushroom.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Okay, let's eat. 

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Madam. 

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000
You killed me to cover up that Mr. Tian is a homosexual.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
You caused me to die painfully. 

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
You have to pay for it.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
I will kill you.

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
I will kill you.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
If this still can't be handled, I am still worried. 

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000
And if this is revealed, 

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Tian's secret that we're struggling to hide may be exposed again.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
What is Tian's secret?

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Bua, Bua.

00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.000
Yang, you're here. I have something to ask of you.

00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.000
Do you want to know about Madam Li's condition?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Madam Li? What happened?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000
If you didn't want to know about Madam Li's condition, 

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000
so what are you asking me about?

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Let's talk about that later. 

00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.000
But what's wrong with Madam Li?

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.000
Yesterday, I brought her stuff, she still seemed fine.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.000
So is she alright?

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
I've heard that she has been in bed all day. 

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
That's weird. 

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
She was exposed to the rain. The weather hasn't changed as well. 

00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:32.000
Why is she so sick?

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Or is it because of the mushrooms?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Because yesterday, Aunt Kham made mushrooms for us. 

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000
Madam ate a mouthful and then vomited.

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.000
Mushrooms from the backyard?

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:47.000
Right. 

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Oh, Bua. 

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Come and collect the mushrooms here.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
What mushrooms?

00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.000
Here. Come and see it. 

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Are there mushrooms here? / Here. 

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.000
Yes, a lot. Come, come. 

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
What mushroom? I come here often.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
I've never seen so many mushrooms like this. 

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.000
I doubt they're magic mushroom. I can't collect them all. 

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:17.000
It tastes good too.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Come on, I'll help you. I'll collect some for you.

00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.000
Okay. 

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
It's a very big.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Yesterday when Aunt Kham told me that there were a lot of mushrooms.

00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.000
I didn't think it would this much. 

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
But what are these mushroom called?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000
I don't know either. 

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
The workers ate mushrooms.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.000
Father, Mother, Tian and I also ate mushrooms.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000
But no one got sick. 

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
But why does only Madam Li get sick?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Or is Madam Li allergic to this mushroom?

00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:29.000
I think we'd better take this mushroom to the pharmacy

00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.000
and ask him what this mushroom is, whether it's dangerous. 

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Okay. 

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Let's collect it. / Okay. 

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Mr. Song, Jia has prepared medicine for you.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Thanks. 

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
Drink some medicine and get some rest.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:12.000
The doctor has warned you many times.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.000
And there're troubles these days. 

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Drink some medicine and get some sleep.

00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:19.000
I haven't slept much lately.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Well, there's a mess everyday. 

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Sir. 

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000
I think it's time for Tian to succeed you

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000
doing the duty on behalf of you.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000
You also saw that he was able to cope with Mr. Ma very well.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:38:54.000
You don't have to worry about anything.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Right, Bua?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Do you agree with me?

00:38:01.300 --> 00:38:03.000
Please talk to Mr. Song. 

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Mr. Song is not feeling well these days.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
I'm afraid...

00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:11.000
See?

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
The worse your health is, the more you have to let Tian take the position quickly.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
You too. 

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000
The day before, you had a mushroom and vomited. 

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000
You should let the doctor check.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000
I'm okay, much better now. 

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Sir. 

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
We are both very old.

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:38.000
Seeing our child getting married and succeeding you. 

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000
This is considered our dream before we die. 

00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.000
I know that. 

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Tian has all the qualities and is ready to inherit

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
But according to the rules, he has to get married first.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
If we don't follow the rules and follow our heart instead, 

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
who will respect us as a leader?

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000
I think I'm right. Let he get married first

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Because if he has a family, he will be able to take care of the association, 

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:10.000
which is like our big family.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Madam, 

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.000
if we rush and break the custom, 

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000
I'm afraid it's not good.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
That's right.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Once he gets married, 

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
one week after, he can take the position.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
I've looked for the auspicious time.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
There is a good day in one month and a half for auspicious occasions.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
So let's take that day.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000
You only have a month and a half left to interrupt this. 

00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:09.000
Once Mr. Tian gets married and takes the position, 

00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:10.000
Mr. Yang will lose completely.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Losing everything to Mr. Tian. 

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Right, what should I do?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
How about this? 

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:23.000
When we can't change others, then change ourselves.

00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:27.000
Just think that all the treasures are not ours in the first place.

00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.000
You may be more at ease.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Should I go to ordain?

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Then I'd like to be your attendant.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:37.000
Eat this. Attendant?

00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:40.000
Remember this. I will never give up.

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.000
Whether it's a month or a day, 

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I won't despair.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Tian is getting married in a month and a half?

00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.000
Yes. 

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Madam Li wants him to inherit the title from him.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:01.000
Therefore, she needs to rush this to get married first according to the rules.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
But I don't agree to this. 

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Because Tian must definitely have a secret.

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.000
I thought it must be something serious.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Otherwise, they wouldn't kill Dong to keep his mouth shut.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
One more thing, 

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Tian is disrespectful. 

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
He doesn't care about seniors.

00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:30.000
Look at what he did to you that day.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
But if it was my Yang, 

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
he wouldn't definitely do that.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Because he is conscious

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000
and obey the one has more experience. 

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
If we wants to do anything, 

00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:54.000
he will get his opinion from you first for sure. 

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
From today,

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
I would like you

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
to send me news 

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
of where Tian goes and what he does.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Which day?

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000
What time?

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
I will handle this myself. 

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
How are you going to handle this?

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Killing Tian of course. 

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
And what about Mr. Song?

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:34.000
Are you leaving him like that?

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
I found out that

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Big Brother is sick right now. He can't work hard anymore. 

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000
By the end of this year, he still need to find a successor.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:51.000
If Tian dies, it must Yang to succeed him. 

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.000
We act like Cao Cao, 

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000
controlling Yang from behind

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
and waiting for the day to take power.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
I've never seen a mushroom like this before.

00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.000
That's fine. Thanks.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
Thank you. 

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Let's go.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Have you ever seen this mushroom before?

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
This one?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
I've never seen one.

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Okay, thank you.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Thanks. 

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
No one knows about this mushroom.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Then our feeling that 

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
this mushroom is probably related to the chaos in our house

00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.000
might be true.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Right. 

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.000
We have asked herbal shops and pharmacies across the town, 

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.000
but no one can explain about this mushroom.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.000
And the only person who is good at herbs is Aunt Jia, 

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
which we can't let her know absolutely that we are suspicious of this mushroom.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Yang.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
In the past, Song family had a Chinese doctor

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
who specialized in herbal medicine. 

00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Where is he now?

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Doctor Qi who was here?

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Yes, Sir. Do you know how is he now?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
A few months after Li and Chan gave birth to children, 

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Doctor Qi asked permission to go to China to continue his studies.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Really? Did he contact you?

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000
We haven't been in contact at all.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
But I've heard that he is back in Thailand

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Thailand?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Do you know where he is?

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
I heard that he...

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
He's back to Chonburi.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
And he said he was coming back here.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
But he didn't contact me.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
If he was here, 

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
he would be able to help take care of me.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
I don't know if we'll meet again in this life. 

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
And what about you?

00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:40.000
Why do you ask about him?

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Right. 

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Why do you suddenly ask about Doctor Qi?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
It's nothing, Madam. 

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Just thinking about the old times.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000
I thought there was something else.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Li. 

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.000
It's a matter of my health.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
We talk about health and then Bua thought of Doctor Qi.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Saying he was good at herbs.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
If he was still here, he would be able to help take care of me. 

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:29.000
Oh, if that's the case, let Jia take care of it.

00:46:29.600 --> 00:46:33.000
She also learned a lot about medicinal herbs from Doctor Qi.

00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.000
She's equally talented.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
We have to find the right time to destroy that mushroom.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Otherwise, the workers would not stop collecting and eating them. 

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Hurry up and deal with it.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
I will summon the workers who built the bunker to have meal. 

00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:06.000
This can delay them for an hour.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
It can be done in ten minutes. 

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Just pouring the fermented water specially made by me.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.000
I guarantee that there will be no remains.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Let's take a break.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Today, Madam Li provides another meal for us. 

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000
She told us to come and eat them all. Let's go quickly.

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.000
Put things down first.

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Go.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Did Madam Li hear you ask for Doctor Qi?

00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.000
Yes, and she acted strangely too.

00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:37.000
But when Mr. Song said he was sick, so he thought of Doctor Qi, 

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Madam Li did not investigate anything further.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Doctor Qi is living in Chonburi.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.000
we can't find him right now.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000
If we meet Doctor Qi, we'll know what mushroom it is, 

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
and if it has anything to do with the mystery in our home.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
What is this?

00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Auntie, what's up?

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Why are all the mushrooms dead?

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:17.000
That's right, they were still fine yesterday.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Let's see if we can still eat them. 

00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:22.000
Wait! / No!

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000
The worms are all dead as well?

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Has anyone watered and plowed the soil here?

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:57.000
No, we just leave it as it is.

00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.000
It grows well naturally. 

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000
That's really strange.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Have we searched the entire place yet?

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Yes. 

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
What we haven't done yet is to dig the ground around the palace to find treasures.

00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Even selling the treasures wouldn't be enough to redeem the palace from Aunt Li. 

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Madam. 

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Why do you try to get money to redeem the palace back?

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Well, I don't want to marry Tian. 

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Oh, is it because of Mr. Yang?

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Noi. 

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000
How do you know it?

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Am I that easy to read?

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Lady, I have seen you since you were little.

00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:26.000
Who do I not know if you love or hate someone?

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.000
At first, I thought that if I marry Tian, I would be fine.

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.000
Even if we don't love each other now, we'll love each other eventually. 

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000
And it's also one way that we can redeem our palace back.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000
But when...

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:54.000
But when you meet someone who truly loves you, you want to fight for it, right?

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:59.000
I'll fight for it. Fight for my own way of life.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
That's my lady. 

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Pin. 

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Dress up pretty and cute tomorrow.

00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.000
I will take you out to have a meal. 

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Sir. 

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000
I didn't visit you at all. I'm sorry.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000
I don't have much time. The work is too busy.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
It's okay. 

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Today I made an appointment because I wanted to talk about Tian and Pin.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000
I'd like to tell you that I already have an auspicious time. 

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:11.000
I am so excited that I choked.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.000
When is it?

00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:15.000
A month and a half.

00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.000
A month and a half?

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Isn't that too fast?

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:27.000
It's too soon.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:30.000
I'm afraid that I can't prepare in time.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.000
What prepare?

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
That's good, Madam Li.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:38.000
I think what Pin said is correct.

00:53:38.700 --> 00:53:41.000
It's a bit early. 

00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:44.000
We should give her a little more time.

00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:46.000
Wow, look. 

00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:49.000
These two kids get along like a house on fire.

00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:52.000
This is good. 

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:54.000
The auspicious time for wedding

00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.000
can't be postponed.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Right. Let's do as what you said.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
I'm very pleased, no problem at all.

00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:03.000
You can handle it, Madam. 

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000
If you agree to this, 

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
let's talk about the bride price now. 

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Bride price?

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Tian.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Take Pin out for a walk.

00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.000
The adults will talk about preparing for the wedding.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.000
You two will be bored.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Yes, Mother. 

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Thanks. 

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Don't worry about your palace. 

00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:41.000
I will give it as a wedding gift for our children.

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:42.000
Is it good?

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
A lot.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Thank you very much.

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:51.000
And if you have anything to suggest, you can tell me. 

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Thank you very much, Sir. 

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
We only have a month and a half left. 

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:58.000
I won't be able to find the money to redeem the palace in time.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
I've tried to stop Mother and Father already, but they didn't listen to me.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:09.000
Pin, Tian. 

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Nangnoi said that you will get married tomorrow?

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Not tomorrow, but another month and a half.

00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.000
What? Nangnoi said that…

00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.000
I was afraid that you would arrive late

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
so I lied that she was getting married tomorrow.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:26.000
You ran and didn't even wait for me.

00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:27.000
Nangnoi.

00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.000
Alright. 

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Now, 

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
whether it's a month and a half or tomorrow, it's no different.

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:35.000
And where will we find the money?

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Tian. 

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Why is Madam in such a hurry?

00:55:39.300 --> 00:55:43.000
She wants me to get married so that I can succeed Father.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
How are we going to interrupt the wedding?

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Oh, I have an idea.

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Lady Pin and Mr. Tian, you guys just get married

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000
to deceive your parents first.

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000
No, we can't do that. 

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
If I and Pin get married, 

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000
my parents will definitely rush me into having an heir.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
We need hundreds of thousands baht to redeem the palace.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Even if I help with my saving, it's not enough anyway.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:25.000
Using the company's money?

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Mother must know it for sure.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Pin. 

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000
No matter what, I'll interrupt your wedding.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Tian, but if you are not married yet, 

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.000
you won't be able to inherit from Father. 

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Forget about that. 

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
My brother's happiness must come first.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:04.000
Pin, if we think positively, 

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
we still have a month and a half left

00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.000
to figure out how to get money to redeem the palace.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Then you won't have to get married.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Mother.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Mother.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Here it is. 

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Pin's title deed. 

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Mother.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Do you have to do this?

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000
It's not like that, Mother. 

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
I just want to come and check

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.000
the mortgage contract and Pin's palace deed

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
whether it's correct.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000
You don't have to worry about that.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Mortgage contract and Pin's palace deed

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000
is legal. 

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
There were witnesses and the seal is correct.

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Therefore, 

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
even if someone steals it back to Pin, 

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
it is useless. 

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
You don't want to marry Lady Pin

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
to the point where you have to steal the title deed and return it to her?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000
I pity her. 

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000
If you have pity on her, that's good.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Just get married to her.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Once you get married, she'll get her palace back.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I pity her

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000
because she has to marry someone who didn't love her.

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
And you know what I am. 

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.200
I know it. 

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.000
I know that your secret makes you unable to marry Pin.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
But other people don't know this.

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Mother.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
We've talked about this many times, Tian.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
And I won't change my mind.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
One more month and a half, 

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
you have to marry Pin. 

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Mr. Tian's secret.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Tian's secret?

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.000
Yes, Madam. 

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Madam Li talked to Mr. Tian that

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
his secret made him unable to love Lady Pin.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
It's probably related to what Dong said before he died.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Or was that secret really what caused Dong to die?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Mud. 

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Does Tian hide his lover?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
As far as I can see, he has no one. 

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
He works hard every day. 

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.000
I didn't see any woman around him. 

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:52.000
The secret that prevents him to marry Lady Pin.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.000
What's the secret, Tian?

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:09.000
I told you I had a few treasures left.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
You don't think that it will be this few, right?

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000
But you have a vast land with you now. 

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
I might sell it for a good price. 

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000
It is a waste land.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Father and I never took care of it. The location is far.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000
There was an acquaintance selling it to my father in the past. 

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.000
My father pitied him, so he bought it.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
If we can't sell the treasures and land, 

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.000
we have to find another way.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000
I think there must be a way that we can earn more money.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
I make delicious desserts, or...

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
Should I sell desserts?

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:12.000
Hey, we need hundreds of thousands.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
If you make desserts, you have to make hundreds of thousands of pieces to be enough.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000
That's true. 

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
I'm really crazy.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
Who sells desserts to pay debts?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It's only a month and a half.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Don't lose hope.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I think we need to help each other out.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:37.000
There must be some way that we can redeem the palace back.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.000
Believe me?

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.000
And if we can't?

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Just get married to Tian.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
It's good. That's easy. 

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
I'm kidding.

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.000
I'm kidding too. 

01:03:53.300 --> 01:03:54.000
I won't get married.

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:57.000
Though a month and a half is difficult, 

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I will try my best.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
It’s better than marrying and living with someone I don’t love for the rest of my life.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
I'm so happy hearing this. 

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
I want to take you away now. 

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Yang. 

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Let's go. Pack your back now, shall we?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000
I heard that Madam Li had already talked about the wedding and the bride price. 

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000
I don't know if Mr. Ma will be able to stop him.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:39.000
I didn't see Mr. Ma did anything.

01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:42.000
Besides, he also uses you to send news 

01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:44.000
of what Tian's doing and where he's been to.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
As if Mr. Tian will always report to us.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
I don't know why he wants to know it. 

01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:53.000
Idiot.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Think about it. 

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:58.000
What would a person like Mr. Ma do?

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.000
You're here.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
What's the matter?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Mr. Song requests to see you.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000
I call everyone to come here today

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
because I have good news to inform you. 

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
In another month and a half, 

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
there will be an auspicious event of Tian.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:44.000
So I want to take everyone to pay respects to the god

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
at the Song family's shrine in Chonburi.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
So I want everyone to get ready.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
We will depart tomorrow.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
What did you write?

01:06:27.500 --> 01:06:28.000
Don't tell me you wrote a goodbye letter to enter priesthood. 

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
You only want me to be ordained?

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:34.000
Take this. 

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Take it to Mr. Ma and don't let anyone see this.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000
It's time for heaven to take my side.

01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:47.000
Heaven does not favor wicked.

01:06:47.300 --> 01:06:48.000
Nuan!

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Why are you mad?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
Heaven does not favor the wicked.

01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:55.000
But you are good, so heaven has mercy on you.

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:58.000
You want a kick, huh?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000
I want to wear a black dress to Tian's wedding now. 

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
I can hardly wait for this moment.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Sir. 

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Mr. Song takes many people to the shrine.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Aren't there too many people?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
A lot of people are good. He won't be careful.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:28.000
We have Chan as a decoy. It will be fine.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:31.000
Call Jiu for me. I have a job for him. 

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
I have a job for you to do.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
This job is very important.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Don't make a mistake.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
If you are successful, 

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:56.000
I will give you the medicine formula used to treat your sister.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
You will be free. You can do whatever you want in the future.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.000
You don't have to take my job in exchange for medicine to cure your sister again.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Just tell me who do you want me to kill.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I want you to kill the Song's eldest son.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Aren't you in love with Pin?

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.000
Or you...

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000
Excuse me. Do you know someone named Doctor Qi?

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:10.000
What shall we do?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Who is investigating this?

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:15.000
I won't believe anything until I have evidence.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Do you have anything to tell me?

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000
If he's not dead, your sister will.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:26.000
Yang, can you call Tian for me?
