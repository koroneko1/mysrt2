00:06.000 --> 00:12.074
You're watching from StreanFlex app. 
Enjoy watching.

00:18.250 --> 00:20.627
Who can name all the apostles?

00:20.711 --> 00:22.671
Yes, Deloris.

00:22.755 --> 00:25.216
John, Paul, George...

00:25.299 --> 00:28.010
and Ringo.

00:30.847 --> 00:32.390
Deloris Wilson,

00:32.473 --> 00:36.019
you are the most unruly,
disobedient girl in this school.

00:36.102 --> 00:39.230
Now, I want you to march
right up to that blackboard...

00:39.314 --> 00:43.401
and write the names of all
the apostles alphabetically.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.757
This is enough.
You are hopeless.

01:04.840 --> 01:07.343
And I wash my hands of you.

01:07.426 --> 01:08.928
Mark my words, Deloris.

01:09.011 --> 01:11.306
If you continue
on this disruptive track,

01:11.389 --> 01:13.391
it will lead
straight to the devil.

01:13.474 --> 01:17.771
Have you any idea
what girls like you become?

01:25.070 --> 01:27.656
Whenever I'm with him.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.408
Something inside.

01:29.491 --> 01:32.661
- Inside.
- Starts to burning.

01:32.745 --> 01:36.165
And I'm filled with desire.

01:36.248 --> 01:38.000
Would it be the devil in me.

01:38.084 --> 01:40.336
Or is this the way
love's supposed to be.

01:40.419 --> 01:42.505
- It's like a heat wave.
- Heat wave.

01:42.588 --> 01:44.674
- Burning in my heart.
- Heat wave.

01:44.757 --> 01:47.176
- I can't keep from crying.
- Heat wave.

01:47.260 --> 01:49.679
- It's tearing me apart.
- Heat wave.

01:49.762 --> 01:52.682
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:52.766 --> 01:55.268
- I said, oh, yeah.
- Heat wave.

01:55.352 --> 01:57.854
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah.

01:57.938 --> 02:00.857
- I said, Oh, yeah.
- Ain't nothing but love, girl.

02:00.941 --> 02:03.277
Don't pass up this chance.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.279
Here's a chance
for a true romance.

02:05.362 --> 02:06.947
Heat wave.

02:15.206 --> 02:18.292
Nothing you can say
can tear me away

02:18.376 --> 02:20.461
from my guy.

02:20.545 --> 02:22.130
My guy.

02:22.213 --> 02:25.133
Nothing you can do
'cause I'm stuck like glue.

02:25.216 --> 02:28.845
- To my guy.
- My guy
- My guy

02:28.928 --> 02:32.140
I'm sticking to my guy
like a stamp to a letter.

02:32.224 --> 02:35.644
Like two birds of a feather
we stick together

02:35.727 --> 02:37.479
I'm telling you
from the start

02:37.563 --> 02:40.816
I can't be torn apart
from my guy.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.651
Whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa.

02:42.735 --> 02:44.361
No muscle-bound man.

02:44.445 --> 02:47.990
Could take my hand
from my guy.

02:48.074 --> 02:49.492
My guy.

02:49.575 --> 02:52.995
No handsome face
could ever take the place.

02:53.079 --> 02:56.499
- Of my guy.
- My guy
- My guy.

02:56.582 --> 02:59.836
He may not be
a movie star.

02:59.919 --> 03:03.506
But when it comes
to being happy, we are.

03:03.590 --> 03:05.133
There's not a man today.

03:05.216 --> 03:09.137
Who could take me away
from my guy.

03:09.221 --> 03:11.974
- What'd you say.
- There's not a man today.

03:12.057 --> 03:15.978
Who could take me away
from my guy.

03:16.061 --> 03:18.981
- Tell me more.
- There's not a man today.

03:19.064 --> 03:22.151
Who could take me away from.

03:22.234 --> 03:25.363
All right. Wrap this up, okay?
Wrap it up.

03:25.446 --> 03:27.823
I will follow him

03:27.907 --> 03:31.160
follow him
wherever he may go.

03:31.244 --> 03:33.830
There isn't
an ocean too deep.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.832
A mountain too high
it can keep.

03:35.915 --> 03:38.418
- Keep me away.
- You better, you better.

03:38.501 --> 03:40.754
- I will follow him.
- follow him.

03:40.837 --> 03:44.132
Ever since he touched
my hands I knew.

03:44.216 --> 03:46.760
That near him
I always must be.

03:46.843 --> 03:48.762
And nothing
can keep me away.

03:48.845 --> 03:51.682
He is my destiny

03:51.765 --> 03:54.018
I love him, I love him
I love him.

03:54.101 --> 03:56.353
- And where he goes I'll. - follow.
- I'll - follow.

03:56.437 --> 03:59.190
- He'll always be my.
- True love - My - True love

03:59.273 --> 04:01.442
- from now until for.
- Ever - or - Ever.

04:01.525 --> 04:03.945
- Whoo!
- Whoo!

04:04.028 --> 04:05.446
Go.

04:08.032 --> 04:10.827
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

04:10.910 --> 04:13.037
- I'm a whole.
- Heat wave.

04:13.121 --> 04:15.290
- Yeah, yeah. - Keep burning.
- Yeah, yeah - Keep burning.

04:15.373 --> 04:17.750
- I'm a whole, yeah.
- Ain't nothing but love, girl.

04:17.834 --> 04:20.128
Don't pass up this chance.

04:20.212 --> 04:22.089
A diamond bracelet
and a pair of pants.

04:22.172 --> 04:24.466
- Heat wave.
- Good night, ladies and gentlemen.

04:24.550 --> 04:26.468
- Heat wave.
- You don't give a shit.

04:26.552 --> 04:28.804
- Heat wave.
- Let's get the hell out of here.

04:28.887 --> 04:30.139
Heat wave.

04:41.526 --> 04:44.487
So I... I guess eating is
out of the question, huh?

04:44.570 --> 04:47.657
Eat? Your next show
is in 20 minutes.

04:47.740 --> 04:49.784
You still haven't told me
what she said.

04:50.910 --> 04:53.497
- What who said?
- "What who said?"

04:53.580 --> 04:55.791
The one with the moustache.
The one you're married to.

04:58.085 --> 05:01.004
You are so damn hot.

05:01.088 --> 05:03.632
And you are so full of it.
You didn't tell her, did you?

05:03.716 --> 05:05.301
I knew it. I knew you
weren't gonna tell her.

05:05.384 --> 05:06.802
I knew it.

05:10.556 --> 05:12.141
I want us
to be together, babe.

05:12.224 --> 05:13.643
Hmm.

05:13.726 --> 05:17.313
I want us to be
an honest, decent couple.

05:17.397 --> 05:18.690
I do.

05:18.773 --> 05:20.817
I went to confession today.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.652
You went to confession?

05:22.735 --> 05:24.654
Like confession confession?

05:24.738 --> 05:28.825
You know where you kneel in the box, you
tell the priest your deepest secrets?

05:28.909 --> 05:30.827
Well, I did that today
for us, babe.

05:30.911 --> 05:33.497
I told Father Antonelli
I was in love...

05:33.580 --> 05:35.332
and that it was
a special love.

05:35.415 --> 05:38.502
A love for all the ages
and that I want to be with her.

05:38.585 --> 05:40.796
And what did he say?

05:40.879 --> 05:44.300
He said that if I got divorced
I'd burn in hell for all eternity.

05:44.383 --> 05:46.510
- Hand me my loafers, doll.
- You...

05:46.594 --> 05:48.846
No, I... You-You can get
your own damn shoes.

05:48.930 --> 05:50.348
So what does this...
What does this mean?

05:50.431 --> 05:53.351
- Is this no? Does this mean no?
- No. No.

05:53.434 --> 05:55.853
- What does it mean?
- Not no. Just not now.

05:57.105 --> 05:59.190
Just get out, okay?
Just go.

06:01.109 --> 06:03.778
You want me
to go against a priest?

06:05.864 --> 06:08.241
Get excommunicated?

06:12.371 --> 06:13.789
Okay.

06:15.874 --> 06:18.836
I'll eat the thing you made.

06:18.919 --> 06:21.797
- Is that was this is all about?
- No, that's not what it's about.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.091
It's about you leaving.
Good night.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.426
Good night!

06:28.971 --> 06:30.473
I'll call.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.821
You're quitting just because
he won't leave his wife?

06:44.905 --> 06:46.907
No, not just because
he won't leave his wife.

06:46.990 --> 06:49.993
I'm quitting for a lot of reasons.
It's something I have to do.

06:50.077 --> 06:52.454
- What's gonna happen to the act? -What do
you mean, "What's gonna happen to the act"?

06:52.538 --> 06:54.915
You're gonna get somebody else.
It's not a big loss.

06:54.999 --> 06:57.293
Well, you put everything together.
You pick all the music.

06:57.376 --> 06:59.086
You tell us where to stand
and everything.

06:59.170 --> 07:01.047
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm a real genius.

07:01.130 --> 07:03.007
I'm a real genius.
That's why we're packin' 'em in.

07:03.091 --> 07:05.677
And don't you pack any more
of my make-up in that bag.

07:05.760 --> 07:08.096
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

07:08.179 --> 07:12.058
- What do you want, huh?
- And don't you ever knock?

07:12.142 --> 07:15.729
Hey, girl, you ain't got nothing
that I haven't seen before, all right.

07:15.812 --> 07:18.065
Yeah, well, stop tryin'
to memorize it.

07:18.148 --> 07:20.275
- Hey, Michelle.
- Oh, please.

07:20.359 --> 07:23.237
Hey, uh, Deloris, here.
This is from Vince.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.947
- Here.
- I hope it's his dead body.

07:25.030 --> 07:27.241
- With love.
- Oh, really?

07:27.324 --> 07:29.493
- Yeah.
- Then why didn't he bring it down to me himself?

07:29.577 --> 07:31.912
Oh, he wanted to, but he's
got a big meetin' upstairs.

07:31.996 --> 07:34.290
- Hey, Tina.
- Hi.

07:34.373 --> 07:36.167
Could you say good night
to these clowns, please?

07:36.250 --> 07:38.836
I'm getting a headache. I don't
want them in here. Get out.

07:38.920 --> 07:40.838
- Let's go.
- All right, I'm goin'.

07:42.674 --> 07:44.592
Just take it easy.

07:47.345 --> 07:49.639
Well, at least you got somethin'
out of all of this.

07:49.723 --> 07:51.892
- Come on, Deloris, open this up.
- Yes.

07:51.975 --> 07:54.645
Why should I open this? I don't
give a damn what's in that box.

07:54.728 --> 07:56.772
- I don't care. - Oh, see what the
man brought you. - I want to see it.

07:56.855 --> 07:58.148
- Why?
- Come on.
- Why?

07:58.232 --> 07:59.942
- Well, I want to see.
- Fine, okay.

08:00.025 --> 08:02.403
Let's look and see
what it is then.

08:02.486 --> 08:04.655
- Oh, look at this. - Oh.
- Look at this. - Check it out.

08:04.738 --> 08:06.157
- It's mink.
- Yes!

08:06.240 --> 08:08.534
- It's purple mink, Deloris.
- Oh.

08:08.617 --> 08:10.494
Oh, that's beautiful!
Look.

08:10.578 --> 08:12.497
- Oh.
- Feel.

08:19.420 --> 08:22.298
Well, obviously, Mr LaRocca
feels he can win me back...

08:22.382 --> 08:27.637
by sending me this
absolutely fabulous coat.

08:27.721 --> 08:29.014
- Mm-hmm.
- Whoo!

08:29.097 --> 08:32.142
- Put it on. Put it on.
- It's beautiful.

08:32.226 --> 08:35.312
Well, see, some girls would fall
for that, but not me.

08:35.395 --> 08:36.647
I think I'm gonna make him
wait a little while...

08:36.730 --> 08:39.107
before I just
let him know that I...

08:39.984 --> 08:41.235
What?

08:46.449 --> 08:48.367
Connie LaRocca.

08:49.911 --> 08:52.705
It's his wife's coat.

08:52.789 --> 08:54.707
The man gave me
his wife's coat.

08:56.751 --> 08:59.504
- Oh, I don't believe this.
- Put it back on.

08:59.587 --> 09:01.840
It's yours now.
You deserve it.

09:01.923 --> 09:05.469
No, I don't deserve it.
I haven't earned it.

09:05.552 --> 09:08.680
You don't earn other people's
wife's fur coats.

09:08.764 --> 09:10.724
Okay?

09:10.808 --> 09:13.894
I think it's time to just go upstairs
and give it back to him,

09:13.978 --> 09:15.896
get the hell out
of this dump.

09:18.983 --> 09:22.111
How long you been
with me, Ernie?

09:22.195 --> 09:25.782
- Um, three years, Mr LaRocca.
- Really?

09:25.865 --> 09:28.409
Two as a croupier, one
as your personal limo driver.

09:28.493 --> 09:32.747
Ernie, you know what's
important to me, what counts?

09:32.831 --> 09:35.250
Loyalty, my man.

09:35.333 --> 09:37.419
Loyalty is what
counts to me.

09:37.502 --> 09:40.338
Well, I've been very loyal,
Mr LaRocca.

09:40.422 --> 09:42.257
Gee, Ernie,
that's not what I hear.

09:42.341 --> 09:44.426
I hear you went down to the
police station last night...

09:44.510 --> 09:47.262
and talked with
Lieutenant Souther.

09:47.346 --> 09:49.890
I hear you were there
for over three hours.

09:51.433 --> 09:53.978
I-I-I-I went.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.105
I went, but I didn't
tell them anything.

09:56.981 --> 09:58.232
Again, not what I heard.

10:00.318 --> 10:01.778
Goodbye, Vince.

10:01.861 --> 10:04.822
I'm leaving
and don't try to stop me.

10:04.906 --> 10:06.866
I'm going to L.A.
where it's nice and warm.

10:06.950 --> 10:11.329
People don't need fur coats from
their boyfriend's wife's closet.

10:11.413 --> 10:15.041
Goodbye, Vince. I'm going to Miami,
where the sun shines.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.922
I know they're trying
to get something on me, Ernie,

10:20.005 --> 10:22.216
but so far they've come up
with bubkas.

10:24.051 --> 10:28.639
They called Willy and Joey in there,
but they were out in 20 minutes.

10:28.722 --> 10:31.058
What were you doing there
for three hours, Ernie?

10:33.060 --> 10:36.355
I know you don't think I have
any talent, Vince, but I do.

10:36.439 --> 10:39.150
And I'm gonna leave you,
and I'm going to Chicago.

10:39.233 --> 10:41.861
Tell me what you told Souther.

10:43.530 --> 10:46.116
I won't be able to sleep
tonight if I don't know.

10:46.199 --> 10:48.201
I've always wanted
to go to New York.

10:48.285 --> 10:51.872
I know if I went to New York, I could get
some things together, Vince. I could.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.373
I could... I could.

10:54.458 --> 10:55.876
I could.

10:59.922 --> 11:02.007
That's all I told him.
I swear it.

11:02.091 --> 11:05.803
Thanks, Ernie.
Now I can sleep.

11:05.886 --> 11:10.266
- Say good night, Ernie.
- No, no, no. That's all...

11:18.274 --> 11:21.361
Babe. Deloris.

11:21.444 --> 11:24.906
Deloris.
Is there a problem?

11:26.074 --> 11:28.368
- With the coat?
- With the coat? No.

11:28.452 --> 11:31.330
No, not with the coat.
The coat's fine. I...

11:32.122 --> 11:34.041
It's... It's fine.

11:34.124 --> 11:36.835
It's... It's fine.
Thank-Thank you.

11:36.919 --> 11:39.338
Is that why you came here
tonight? To thank me?

11:39.422 --> 11:41.716
Yeah. Thank you.

11:44.468 --> 11:49.223
And to say you're sorry, about
tonight and the things you said?

11:50.099 --> 11:51.726
Forgotten.

11:51.809 --> 11:53.561
Completely.
You understand me?

11:53.645 --> 11:56.064
- Forgotten.
- Of-Of course.

11:56.147 --> 11:58.066
It's... Of course.
It's forgotten.

11:58.149 --> 12:01.570
That's my girl.
My girl in mink.

12:01.653 --> 12:03.572
- Will you be home?
- Yeah. - Soon? - Yeah.

12:05.574 --> 12:07.993
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

12:10.412 --> 12:13.249
Hey, Vince, is she okay?

12:13.332 --> 12:17.336
I don't know, Vince.
She seemed kind of upset.

12:17.420 --> 12:18.754
- She did?
- Yeah.

12:21.090 --> 12:22.925
Bring her back, now,
for a talk.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.385
And if she runs,
then what?

12:26.012 --> 12:27.555
Take care of it.

12:31.851 --> 12:34.771
Deloris!
Come on back!

12:44.239 --> 12:45.949
Deloris,
he just wants to talk!

12:55.126 --> 12:56.419
- Which way?
- That way.

13:43.593 --> 13:45.762
Hey! Hey! Taxi! Hey!

13:47.723 --> 13:50.225
Hey! Hey! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

14:08.119 --> 14:10.455
And then Vince looks at Ernie
and says, "Say good night."

14:10.538 --> 14:13.708
And then Vince looks at Joey
and Joey shot him.

14:13.791 --> 14:15.251
I mean, he just shot him
in the chair.

14:15.335 --> 14:17.212
Just boom.
He blew this guy away!

14:17.295 --> 14:19.547
Sorry I'm late.
I'm Lieutenant Souther.

14:19.631 --> 14:22.217
- Eddie Souther.
- How do you do? I'm Deloris Van Cartier.

14:22.300 --> 14:24.886
Listen, this guy was
a simple limo driver, right?

14:24.970 --> 14:27.764
He was a limo driver. So maybe he made
a couple wrong turns in his life.

14:27.848 --> 14:30.642
That's no reason to kill him.
I've never seen anybody killed before.

14:30.684 --> 14:33.395
Except, you know, sometimes you pass on the
free-way, you see a couple of people dead.

14:33.479 --> 14:35.397
- But it's not the same thing...
- Miss Van Cartier? - What?

14:35.481 --> 14:37.400
You're Vince LaRocca's
girlfriend, right?

14:37.483 --> 14:39.860
Well, you could,
sort of, maybe...

14:39.944 --> 14:42.238
It depends on how you look at it.
I mean, the guy just tried to kill me,

14:42.321 --> 14:44.240
so I don't think that
cements our relationship.

14:44.323 --> 14:47.118
Well, you realize he's a major
underworld figure, don't you?

14:47.201 --> 14:49.746
He's into drug dealing,
money laundering.

14:49.829 --> 14:52.791
We've been investigating Mr LaRocca
for the last 18 months.

14:52.874 --> 14:56.127
We've got videotapes.
We've got surveillance photos.

14:56.211 --> 14:59.005
Am I... Am I in any of the...
On the videotapes?

14:59.089 --> 15:01.258
- No, no, no. Criminal activity.
- Oh.

15:01.341 --> 15:04.052
The tapes aren't enough
to convict him.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.638
Apparently, there's a lot
you don't know about Vince.

15:06.722 --> 15:10.100
I mean, the last two people that saw
him in action kind of disappeared.

15:10.184 --> 15:12.311
What do you mean, they kind of disappeared?
What does that... What do you mean?

15:12.394 --> 15:15.564
Well, we found a piece here
and a piece there.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.234
But don't you worry.
Here, have a cup of coffee.

15:18.317 --> 15:21.779
You're safe now, and we're gonna
see that you stay that way.

15:21.863 --> 15:25.074
- That's our job.
- If you help us, we can help you.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.202
If you testify against Vince
about what you saw,

15:27.285 --> 15:29.287
we can put him away
for the rest of his life.

15:29.371 --> 15:33.208
Are you crazy? You're telling me this guy is
a mad criminal, and you want me to testify?

15:33.291 --> 15:34.918
Do you know what's gonna happen?
He's gonna track me down.

15:35.001 --> 15:36.962
- Deloris. - He's gonna kill me.
- Can I call you Deloris?

15:37.045 --> 15:39.214
You can call me anything you want,
as long as you keep me alive!

15:39.298 --> 15:42.092
- We wouldn't put you at risk if
we couldn't protect you. - Right.

15:42.176 --> 15:45.638
It'll only take a couple
of months to get a court date.

15:45.721 --> 15:48.933
Just a couple of months?
Only a couple? Why not a year?

15:49.016 --> 15:52.478
- How about a couple of decades?
- Two months we hide you out, then you testify.

15:52.562 --> 15:54.981
No! No. No.

15:55.064 --> 15:57.025
It's just for a little while,
then you can come back.

15:57.108 --> 15:59.485
Really? What are you gonna do?
You gonna stick me in a bag and bury me?

15:59.569 --> 16:01.362
Forget it!

16:01.446 --> 16:03.948
If you testify,

16:04.032 --> 16:05.992
I'm gonna put you
in the last place on Earth...

16:06.076 --> 16:09.246
that Vince would ever
look for you.

16:27.557 --> 16:29.684
- Nice church, huh?
- Yeah, it's very nice.

16:29.767 --> 16:32.186
Look, what am I gonna be,
Quasimodo in the bat belfry?

16:32.270 --> 16:35.523
- What is this?
- I want you to stay here for a while.

16:35.607 --> 16:37.066
Where?

16:37.150 --> 16:40.362
In the convent.
It's the safest place in the world.

16:40.445 --> 16:42.364
- You think Vince is gonna look for you
in a convent? - No, no. What? What?

16:42.447 --> 16:45.367
- In the what? - The convent.
- You must be out of your...

16:45.450 --> 16:48.120
You know what? I'm gonna go back and work
this out with Vince. You're a lunatic.

16:48.203 --> 16:50.414
I'm not gonna be in no damn
convent with these people.

16:50.497 --> 16:52.416
These people
don't even have sex!

16:54.460 --> 16:58.130
Deloris, Vince has a contract
out on you for a hundred grand.

16:58.214 --> 16:59.548
- Now you've seen what he can do.
- Look...

16:59.632 --> 17:00.966
One bullet,
that's all it's gonna take.

17:01.050 --> 17:03.094
No, no, look. Let me
explain something to you.

17:03.177 --> 17:05.471
Vince knows people all over
the place. You realize that.

17:05.512 --> 17:08.223
He knows people all over the place. That means
he's gonna be looking for me everywhere.

17:08.308 --> 17:10.143
- Everywhere but this convent.
- Oh, come on!

17:10.184 --> 17:12.103
Nobody knows you're here
but me.

17:12.186 --> 17:15.106
We're trying to get you a quick court
date. One month, two months tops.

17:15.147 --> 17:18.234
I promise I'm gonna spring you
as fast as I can.

17:18.318 --> 17:21.154
What... What am I gonna do here?
I'm gonna go crazy here.

17:21.238 --> 17:23.406
There is nothing but a lot
of white women dressed as nuns.

17:23.490 --> 17:24.907
I'm... What am I gonna do here?

17:26.285 --> 17:29.413
- Pray.
- Pray?

17:29.496 --> 17:32.500
Yes, but, Monsignor,
we are a small convent.

17:32.583 --> 17:34.502
Surely, there are
more appropriate places.

17:34.585 --> 17:38.422
We can save this young woman's life and
imprison a parasite all in one gesture.

17:38.506 --> 17:40.258
My heart goes out to her,
of course.

17:40.341 --> 17:43.594
My concern would be she might
subject the convent to danger.

17:43.678 --> 17:46.931
The Reno Police Department assures me
you'll be protected from any harm.

17:47.015 --> 17:49.601
They've promised to make
a generous financial donation.

17:49.684 --> 17:53.480
And, as you know, your small
convent is in danger of closing.

17:53.563 --> 17:56.566
Well, if they can afford
to be so generous,

17:56.650 --> 17:58.568
so can we.

18:07.161 --> 18:09.079
Excuse me.

18:11.165 --> 18:13.459
Absolutely not.
I couldn't possibly.

18:13.542 --> 18:17.338
Well, think of it this way, Reverend Mother,
she's an ideal prospect for rehabilitation.

18:17.422 --> 18:18.881
That is not a person
you can hide.

18:18.965 --> 18:22.802
That is a conspicuous person,
designed to stick out.

18:22.886 --> 18:26.806
You have taken a vow
of hospitality to all in need.

18:28.767 --> 18:31.353
I lied.

18:36.942 --> 18:38.569
Lieutenant Souther,
everything is in order.

18:38.652 --> 18:40.487
No, no, no, no,
everything is not in order.

18:40.571 --> 18:43.908
- This woman does not like me.
- Deloris, these are holy people.

18:43.991 --> 18:45.493
- They like everybody.
- I don't give a shit what you say!

18:45.576 --> 18:47.662
- This woman does not like me.
- One month. Two months tops.

18:47.745 --> 18:48.996
No, I'm not staying here.
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

18:49.080 --> 18:50.456
I'm not staying here!
I'm telling you, I'm not...

18:50.540 --> 18:52.458
- Behave yourself.
- gonna stay here!

19:09.977 --> 19:11.895
What is your name?

19:11.979 --> 19:14.231
Deloris Van Cartier.

19:14.314 --> 19:15.649
Is that your real name?

19:15.733 --> 19:17.693
Yes.
I happen to be a singer.

19:17.776 --> 19:21.155
- Oh-oh. Do sit down.
- Thank you.

19:23.574 --> 19:25.701
Look, before we get started,
I-I just want to say...

19:25.743 --> 19:27.537
that I really appreciate
what you're doing for me.

19:27.620 --> 19:29.872
I know it must be a huge
inconvenience for you.

19:29.956 --> 19:33.168
Yeah, so I-I just, you know,
wanted to say thank you up front.

19:36.713 --> 19:40.133
I also, uh, have always...

19:40.217 --> 19:43.929
and I've said this to people...
I've always admired you people.

19:44.012 --> 19:47.850
Nuns, I mean.
You know, you're so...

19:47.933 --> 19:50.185
Catholic, you know.

19:50.269 --> 19:51.979
I mean, look, you're
married to the big J.C.

19:52.062 --> 19:53.689
I mean, you're His
old lady, you know.

19:53.772 --> 19:56.984
It's, uh... It's an
amazing thing to me.

19:57.068 --> 19:59.195
I mean, of course, you must be saying,
"Well, it's much better...

19:59.278 --> 20:01.906
than being hooked up
with some kind of two-timing... ".

20:01.989 --> 20:05.576
Please, do not smoke
in here.

20:05.660 --> 20:07.912
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I...
You know, I get so nervous.

20:07.996 --> 20:11.583
I get worked up. I just... I just
had... I don't know. I'm sorry.

20:13.335 --> 20:16.254
Look, Miss Van Cartier, we have agreed
to conceal and protect you,

20:16.338 --> 20:19.257
which we will do
to the best of our ability.

20:19.341 --> 20:21.593
However, it is essential
that you understand...

20:21.677 --> 20:25.139
that you are not
in a sorority or a speak-easy.

20:25.222 --> 20:29.226
This is a convent,
a religious order,

20:29.310 --> 20:32.772
and there are certain rules
you must obey.

20:32.855 --> 20:36.275
St Katherine's is a place
to commune and to pray,

20:36.359 --> 20:40.405
and I will not tolerate any disruption
whatsoever with that communion.

20:41.489 --> 20:43.324
Do you understand?

20:43.408 --> 20:45.535
- Yes.
- Good.

20:45.618 --> 20:48.288
But do you understand
I'm the victim here?

20:48.371 --> 20:49.956
Do you understand
I'm the good guy?

20:50.040 --> 20:53.752
I mean, they just kind of
threw me in here with you nuns.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.463
I mean, do you get that?
I'm the good guy.

20:56.546 --> 20:58.674
I mean, I saw a guy
get his face blown off.

20:58.757 --> 21:01.468
So why don't you just
give me the key to my room?

21:01.552 --> 21:04.471
I'll lay low. You stay out of my face,
I'll stay out of your face.

21:04.555 --> 21:07.141
And I will commune my little
black ass in that room.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.352
Can you handle that?

21:11.020 --> 21:14.357
- I think it's a very good idea.
- Thank you.

21:14.440 --> 21:17.485
Well, it's almost lunchtime.

21:17.568 --> 21:19.612
Perhaps you'd like
to freshen up.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.657
And you'll certainly
want to change.

21:22.824 --> 21:25.452
I just hope you don't think I'm gonna
wear what I wore in Catholic school.

21:25.535 --> 21:27.954
No, siree. No ugly
green jumpers for me.

21:28.038 --> 21:29.956
And those stupid
clunky shoes.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.709
Oh, with this gold thing... Could
you have it dry-cleaned for me?

21:33.919 --> 21:37.172
Open the cabinet to your left.
You will find suitable attire.

21:38.257 --> 21:39.675
Oh, cool.

21:48.434 --> 21:51.354
Oh, no. No, no, no,
I can't do this. I'm sorry.

21:51.437 --> 21:55.275
This is fine for covering a little
bulge, but now I've got holster hips.

21:55.358 --> 21:57.402
People wish to kill you.

21:57.485 --> 21:59.279
Anyone who's met you,
I imagine.

22:01.072 --> 22:03.408
A disguise is necessary
to protect us all.

22:03.492 --> 22:05.786
Now, while you are here,
you will conduct yourself as a nun.

22:05.869 --> 22:08.372
Only I will know who
and what you truly are.

22:08.455 --> 22:11.083
You will draw no attention
to yourself whatsoever.

22:11.166 --> 22:14.128
But look at me! I'm a nun.
I'm a... I'm a penguin!

22:14.211 --> 22:18.507
As from now and until you leave,
you are Sister Mary Clarence.

22:23.721 --> 22:27.600
Mary Clarence? Like-Like Clarence
Williams III from The Mod Squad?

22:27.684 --> 22:30.436
Mary is in deference
to our Holy Mother.

22:30.520 --> 22:34.065
The Clarence is in honour
of St Clarence of Concordia.

22:34.149 --> 22:36.067
There are three vows
every nun must accept.

22:36.151 --> 22:37.402
- The vow of poverty.
- Mmm.

22:37.485 --> 22:38.820
- The vow of obedience.
- Mm-hmm.

22:38.862 --> 22:41.782
- And the vow of chastity.
- I am out of here with that.

22:42.699 --> 22:44.117
Oh, oh, man.

22:44.201 --> 22:47.246
It is necessary to eat...

22:47.329 --> 22:49.748
- Good afternoon, Sisters.
- Good afternoon.

22:49.832 --> 22:51.584
I apologize
for my tardiness.

22:51.667 --> 22:54.920
I would like you to welcome
a new member to our house.

22:55.004 --> 22:57.089
Sister Mary Clarence.

23:00.009 --> 23:05.515
Mary Clarence comes to us from
a somewhat progressive convent.

23:05.598 --> 23:09.436
However, she's eager to embrace
a more disciplined life,

23:09.519 --> 23:13.064
and I am sure will make every
effort to conform to our ways.

23:13.148 --> 23:14.733
I'll do my best.

23:14.816 --> 23:17.194
- Would you like to be seated?
- Thank you.

23:33.127 --> 23:35.546
- Yes, Mary Patrick?
- Reverend Mother,

23:35.630 --> 23:38.049
on behalf of all the Sisters
here at St Katherine's,

23:38.132 --> 23:42.804
I'd like to offer a great big hi there
and hello to Sister Mary Clarence. Hi.

23:42.887 --> 23:45.390
And as part of the welcome,
I thought that maybe...

23:45.473 --> 23:48.018
our new sister could offer
today's blessing.

23:48.101 --> 23:51.354
That is very thoughtful of you,
Mary Patrick, but I really...

23:51.438 --> 23:54.733
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I can...
I can do that. Uh, sure.

23:54.816 --> 23:57.903
Oh, fudge.
Uh, bless us, O Lord,

23:57.986 --> 24:02.157
for these Thy gifts which
we're about to receive.

24:04.410 --> 24:09.999
And, yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of no food,

24:11.250 --> 24:14.003
I will fear no hunger.

24:15.630 --> 24:19.134
We want You to give us
this day our daily bread...

24:19.217 --> 24:21.845
and to the republic
for which it stands,

24:21.928 --> 24:24.347
and by the power
invested in me,

24:24.431 --> 24:28.018
I pronounce us
ready to eat.

24:28.101 --> 24:30.229
- Amen.
- Amen.

24:31.104 --> 24:32.356
Be seated.

24:42.783 --> 24:44.201
Thank you.

25:02.429 --> 25:03.972
Gee, what are you people,
a Pritikin order?

25:04.056 --> 25:05.390
This stuff is terrible.
It tastes like shi...

25:05.474 --> 25:09.395
Sisters, we shall spend
the rest of the day in silence.

25:09.478 --> 25:13.524
- Well, why?
- Only when our lips are silent,

25:13.607 --> 25:16.193
may our prayers
truly be answered.

25:16.277 --> 25:18.070
Then you don't have
to eat this food.

25:19.155 --> 25:21.365
Silence begins now...

25:21.449 --> 25:23.409
and ends at sundown.

25:23.493 --> 25:25.954
How can you eat this stuff?
It's terrible.

25:26.037 --> 25:28.039
Mary Clarence,

25:28.122 --> 25:30.917
I think you might enjoy
a ritual fast.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.879
A ritual f... No. No, no.
I don't think I would.

25:33.962 --> 25:35.881
I'll just put a little salt
in it. It will be fine.

25:35.964 --> 25:38.258
Look, I'm gonna have... Someone
pass me the salt over there.

25:38.342 --> 25:43.305
A fast, to remind you of those
who must endure without food.

25:44.807 --> 25:46.266
I... No, I don't want you
to take...

25:46.308 --> 25:49.812
I don't want you
to take my plate.

25:49.895 --> 25:51.397
And silence.

26:52.628 --> 26:54.546
How can you let them grill me
in there for six hours?

26:54.630 --> 26:56.632
I can't control how long
they're gonna question you.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.884
- Did you go to law school, Larry?
- Yes, I went to law school, Vince.

26:58.968 --> 27:00.886
- Did you graduate?
- Hey, I'm a lawyer.

27:00.970 --> 27:03.431
- Of course I graduated.
- Hey, Vince.

27:04.765 --> 27:07.476
Nice talking to you.
See you in court.

27:08.603 --> 27:10.355
You got nothing
on me, Souther.

27:10.438 --> 27:12.649
And if you don't stop
harassing me, I'm gonna...

27:12.732 --> 27:14.150
What? You're gonna what?

27:14.234 --> 27:16.861
Nothing. Nothing, Lieutenant.

27:16.945 --> 27:18.363
What my client is trying
to say is that...

27:18.446 --> 27:20.031
Is that he's scared.

27:20.115 --> 27:22.701
And you know what?
He should be.

27:22.784 --> 27:25.370
Real scared.

27:25.454 --> 27:27.664
See you around, boys.

27:32.461 --> 27:34.880
Something's going on.

27:34.964 --> 27:37.049
He's so damn cocky.

27:37.133 --> 27:40.219
Ah, he's bluffilng, Vince.
Don't worry about it.

27:42.805 --> 27:45.391
- You find Deloris?
- She's gone.

27:45.475 --> 27:47.894
We don't know where she is, and she
hasn't been back to her place all day.

27:47.977 --> 27:50.438
He's got Deloris.

27:50.522 --> 27:52.607
We gotta get her back.

27:52.691 --> 27:55.360
Fax her eight-by-ten
to every contact we got.

27:55.443 --> 27:57.904
- I can't hear this.
- Deloris Van Cartier.

27:57.988 --> 28:00.532
A quarter of a mil,
dead or alive.

28:05.913 --> 28:08.165
This is your cell,
Mary Clarence.

28:08.248 --> 28:10.334
- My what?
- Your cell.

28:10.417 --> 28:12.336
Your room.

28:16.257 --> 28:17.675
Oh, man.

28:19.260 --> 28:22.847
No wonder you waited till now
to spring this on me.

28:22.930 --> 28:24.682
It's like a nightmare.

28:24.766 --> 28:26.351
Where's the rest
of the furniture?

28:26.434 --> 28:28.186
Our lives are simple.

28:28.269 --> 28:31.523
We have little need
for material possessions.

28:32.607 --> 28:34.359
This is out
of the Stone Age.

28:34.443 --> 28:37.195
- Where's the phone?
- Who would you call?

28:38.780 --> 28:41.283
I don't know. Satan?

28:41.366 --> 28:43.786
Your cell is
more than adequate.

28:43.869 --> 28:47.206
Fine. What do we do now?
Pray? What?

28:47.289 --> 28:49.709
It's 9:00.
Pleasant dreams.

28:49.792 --> 28:52.962
W-W-Wait. Are you telling me
we go to bed by 9:00?

28:53.045 --> 28:57.884
If I were you, I would use this time to
think about my life and its direction.

28:57.967 --> 28:59.802
Or lack thereof.

28:59.886 --> 29:02.138
There's nothing wrong with my life.
You know, before I came here,

29:02.222 --> 29:05.308
I had a career, I had friends,
I had clothing that fit.

29:05.392 --> 29:07.644
Before I came here,
I was okay.

29:07.727 --> 29:09.146
Oh, really?

29:09.229 --> 29:10.647
From what I've heard,

29:10.731 --> 29:13.650
your singing career
was almost non-existent...

29:13.734 --> 29:16.487
and your married lover
wants you dead.

29:16.570 --> 29:19.907
If you're fooling anyone,
it is only yourself.

29:20.908 --> 29:23.994
God has brought you here.

29:24.078 --> 29:26.080
Take the hint.

30:16.633 --> 30:18.051
Mary Clarence.

30:18.134 --> 30:20.345
What?

30:21.972 --> 30:24.433
Up and at 'em.
We don't want to be late.

30:24.516 --> 30:28.562
- What time is it?
- Well, it's almost 5:00, Sister Sleepyhead.

30:28.645 --> 30:30.898
5:00 a.m.?
Get out of here.

30:30.981 --> 30:32.900
I just went to bed
20 minutes ago.

30:32.983 --> 30:37.530
- Get outta here. Scram. - Come on. The
sun is shining. It's a beautiful day.

30:40.199 --> 30:44.579
We are a small congregation
this morning.

30:44.662 --> 30:46.247
Too many mornings.

30:46.331 --> 30:49.584
Something has gone
terribly wrong.

30:49.667 --> 30:52.754
Where is faith?
Where is celebration?

30:52.837 --> 30:54.214
Where is everyone?

30:55.674 --> 30:58.260
Still, rather than regret
the absence of our neighbours,

30:58.343 --> 31:03.098
let us rejoice in the fellowship
of those present.

31:03.182 --> 31:06.018
Our choir mistress,
Sister Mary Lazarus,

31:06.101 --> 31:07.895
has informed me
that our choir,

31:07.978 --> 31:09.605
while always superior,

31:09.688 --> 31:14.235
has been toiling especially hard
on this week's selection.

31:14.318 --> 31:15.653
Sister.

31:31.169 --> 31:34.589
Hail, Holy Queen.

31:34.673 --> 31:38.343
Enthroned above.

31:38.427 --> 31:43.432
Oh, Maria.

31:43.516 --> 31:47.520
- Hail.
- Hail, mother of mercy.

31:47.603 --> 31:50.648
And of love.

31:50.731 --> 31:56.154
Oh, Maria.

31:56.237 --> 31:59.657
Triumph all ye.

31:59.741 --> 32:02.202
Cherubim.

32:02.285 --> 32:04.704
Sing with us.

32:04.788 --> 32:07.541
Ye seraphim.

32:07.624 --> 32:10.460
- Heaven on Earth.
- Heaven and Earth.

32:10.544 --> 32:14.089
Resound the hymn.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.413
There was a raid on a pawnshop
in L.A. this morning.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.415
The place was fencing
stolen property.

32:46.498 --> 32:49.752
- They found this.
- Database hoods.

32:49.835 --> 32:52.087
What a wonderful world, huh?

32:52.171 --> 32:55.090
"Beloved daughter missing.
Reward of $250,000."

32:55.174 --> 32:56.675
Please find
our daughter, Angel.

32:56.759 --> 32:59.178
"We miss her so.
Dead or alive."

32:59.261 --> 33:01.264
Vince is getting desperate.

33:01.347 --> 33:02.723
So where did you
stash her, Eddie?

33:02.807 --> 33:04.350
Where did I stash who?

33:04.434 --> 33:06.728
Wha... You're not even
gonna tell us?

33:06.811 --> 33:09.939
I wouldn't even
tell the Pope.

33:19.658 --> 33:23.412
I'm not gonna get this. This is
a little too complicated for me.

33:23.495 --> 33:26.040
Don't you worry. You'll get
the hang of it. I'll help you.

33:26.123 --> 33:28.250
Thank you.

33:28.334 --> 33:31.587
- Are you always this cheerful?
- Am I?

33:31.670 --> 33:33.881
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, I am. I know it.

33:33.964 --> 33:37.760
I can't help it. I've always
been upbeat, optimistic, perky.

33:37.844 --> 33:39.262
Even as a child,
my mother used to say,

33:39.345 --> 33:41.597
"That girl is pure sunshine.

33:41.681 --> 33:44.267
She'll either grow up to be
a nun or a stewardess."

33:44.350 --> 33:46.019
Coffee?

33:47.520 --> 33:49.105
Enough about me.
What about you?

33:49.189 --> 33:51.107
Yes. What convent
did you come from?

33:52.192 --> 33:57.447
I came from the convent...

33:57.531 --> 34:00.451
of the Sisters
of the Moonlight...

34:00.534 --> 34:01.785
in Reno.

34:01.869 --> 34:03.954
Oh, I love Reno.

34:04.038 --> 34:06.540
- You do?
- Yes.

34:06.624 --> 34:08.208
Well, you-you
would have loved us.

34:08.292 --> 34:11.379
We were... We were
a pioneering kind of order.

34:11.462 --> 34:15.216
You know, we'd, uh, never wear any
kind of habit this tight, though.

34:15.299 --> 34:17.092
This is really tight.

34:17.176 --> 34:21.639
Oh, I must say, our habits do
cut you at the neck just a bit.

34:21.723 --> 34:24.559
- Yeah.
- Hear, hear, hear, hear.

34:24.643 --> 34:27.145
That's enough jabber. Vanity.

34:27.228 --> 34:30.399
A progressive convent?
Sounds awful.

34:30.482 --> 34:32.525
I liked my convent in Vancouver.

34:32.609 --> 34:34.069
Out in the woods.

34:34.152 --> 34:37.114
It wasn't all modern like some
of these newfangled convents.

34:37.197 --> 34:38.574
We didn't have electricity.

34:38.657 --> 34:41.494
Cold water, bare feet.
Those were nuns.

34:41.577 --> 34:43.286
Sounds wonderful.

34:43.370 --> 34:45.581
It was hell on Earth.
I loved it.

34:45.665 --> 34:47.123
This place is a Hilton.

34:47.208 --> 34:50.670
Sister Mary Clarence,
when did you get your call?

34:50.753 --> 34:53.255
What call?

34:53.339 --> 34:54.591
Oh, the call! The call!

34:54.674 --> 34:57.427
I-I didn't know
which call you meant.

34:57.510 --> 35:00.430
I was working... I was working
in Reno, and I got the call.

35:00.513 --> 35:05.185
And you don't know how hard it is to get a
call until you've worked in Reno, you know.

35:05.268 --> 35:08.689
We were just... We-We ministered to
a lot of different kind of people:

35:08.772 --> 35:12.359
newly-weds, hookers, gamblers.

35:12.443 --> 35:15.529
What a joy. How fulfilling to be able to
get right in there with your hands...

35:15.613 --> 35:17.031
and work with the people.

35:17.114 --> 35:19.075
And Reno... It's probably
bursting with sin.

35:19.158 --> 35:20.701
It was. That's...
That's why I had to leave.

35:20.785 --> 35:23.204
I mean, we had a hooker
living next door...

35:23.287 --> 35:26.165
called Buckwheat Bertha
who would...

35:26.249 --> 35:29.210
Sister Mary Clarence,
could I have a word with you?

35:29.294 --> 35:31.379
- Who? Me?
- Yes, you.

35:31.462 --> 35:34.674
Yeah. Excuse me.

35:35.634 --> 35:38.053
Get on with your work.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.389
- Quickly, please.
- I was just talking to 'em.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.891
Precisely. Enough chatter. Chores.

35:57.531 --> 36:01.369
Rescue me
Take me in your arms.

36:01.452 --> 36:05.331
Rescue me
I want your tender charm.

36:05.415 --> 36:09.169
'Cause I'm lonely
and I'm blue

36:09.252 --> 36:14.174
I need you and your love too
Come on and rescue me.

36:14.257 --> 36:17.761
Come on, baby
and rescue me.

36:17.844 --> 36:21.598
Come on, baby
and rescue me.

36:21.682 --> 36:25.436
'Cause I need you
by my side.

36:25.519 --> 36:30.483
Can't you see that I love you
Rescue me.

36:30.566 --> 36:34.111
Come on and take my heart
Take your love.

36:34.195 --> 36:38.449
And comfort every part
'Cause I'm lonely.

36:38.533 --> 36:40.368
And I'm blue

36:40.451 --> 36:43.288
I need you
and your love too.

36:43.371 --> 36:46.249
Come on and rescue me
Come on, baby.

36:46.333 --> 36:49.127
And rescue me.

36:49.211 --> 36:53.006
Come on, baby
and rescue me.

36:53.090 --> 36:56.677
'Cause I need you by my side.

36:56.760 --> 37:00.139
Can't you see that I'm lonely.

37:02.766 --> 37:05.186
Yeah, I need to talk
to Eddie Souther.

37:05.269 --> 37:07.438
Yeah, it's an emergency.

37:08.940 --> 37:11.067
- Souther.
- Eddie! Eddie! Eddie! Eddie!

37:11.150 --> 37:14.195
- You gotta get me outta here.
- Deloris, you can't call me here.

37:14.278 --> 37:16.364
Somebody's gonna catch on
to where you are.

37:16.447 --> 37:19.534
But I'm going insane here. All these
people do is work and pray, work and pray.

37:19.617 --> 37:22.037
- That's all they do.
- Calm down!

37:22.120 --> 37:24.998
Look, I didn't want to tell you this,
but we got some problems here.

37:25.081 --> 37:27.376
Well, what kind of problems?
What do you mean, problems?

37:27.417 --> 37:29.044
Keeping our witnesses alive.

37:29.127 --> 37:31.046
I mean, we hide them,
but there's a leak in the department,

37:31.129 --> 37:32.673
and some of them
end up dead.

37:32.756 --> 37:35.217
- What?
- Just sit tight.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.887
You don't seem to understand
what I'm saying.

37:37.970 --> 37:40.723
I am in a nightmare.
This is my nightmare.

37:40.806 --> 37:43.142
It's a nightmare, man.
Get me outta here.

37:43.225 --> 37:45.728
I mean it. Don't call me.
It's not safe.

37:45.811 --> 37:47.355
I'll be in touch.

37:47.438 --> 37:50.233
Hello? Hello?

38:08.293 --> 38:09.712
Yeah?

38:18.971 --> 38:21.224
I-I-I brought you something.

38:21.307 --> 38:23.226
My brother gave it to me
when I was a little girl.

38:23.309 --> 38:25.228
I could never seem
to get up on time.

38:25.311 --> 38:27.897
So I, um, set it for 5:00.

38:29.315 --> 38:32.235
Out of bed,
you daisy head.

38:32.319 --> 38:33.737
Out of bed,
you daisy head.

38:33.820 --> 38:37.741
- It always made me laugh.
- Out of bed, you daisy head.

38:38.950 --> 38:42.246
I thought, being away
from your convent,

38:42.329 --> 38:45.040
that even someone like you
could get lonely.

38:47.167 --> 38:48.752
Have a seat.

38:55.509 --> 38:59.097
- So which one are you?
- Mary Robert.

38:59.180 --> 39:02.100
You have a little trouble
getting up at 5:00 too, Mary Robert?

39:02.183 --> 39:04.185
Oh, not now.

39:04.269 --> 39:06.730
I get up a half an hour early
just to make sure.

39:06.813 --> 39:08.523
It's-It's not just
the mornings.

39:08.607 --> 39:11.109
It's that all my life...

39:11.193 --> 39:14.363
everybody seems to be doing
or catching on to things...

39:14.446 --> 39:16.782
a second faster
or better than me.

39:16.865 --> 39:20.327
Yeah, well, everybody's
playing catch-up nowadays.

39:20.411 --> 39:23.539
So, Mary Robert,

39:24.790 --> 39:26.292
did you always want
to be a nun?

39:26.375 --> 39:28.711
Mmm. I always knew that
that was my calling:

39:28.794 --> 39:30.046
to lead a life of service.

39:30.129 --> 39:32.048
But, you see,

39:32.131 --> 39:35.551
I've always felt that there's
something inside me...

39:35.635 --> 39:37.553
that I-I want to give.

39:37.637 --> 39:41.891
Something that's only me
and nobody else.

39:43.977 --> 39:46.897
Does that sound
like a terrible thing?

39:46.980 --> 39:48.482
Like pride?

39:50.150 --> 39:54.404
No. It doesn't sound like
a terrible thing at all.

39:54.488 --> 39:57.866
I'm so happy that you've come
to join us, Mary Clarence.

40:05.333 --> 40:09.128
Do you know how sometimes it's as if you
have to be yourself or you'll just burst?

40:11.339 --> 40:13.633
Yep, I do.

40:14.717 --> 40:16.010
Good night.

40:16.094 --> 40:18.596
Good night, Mary Robert.

40:27.856 --> 40:30.776
Out of bed,
you daisy head.

40:30.859 --> 40:32.778
Out of bed,
you daisy head.

41:08.315 --> 41:11.235
- Hang on.
- Hey, hey, wait up.

41:11.318 --> 41:12.987
- Hey.
- Making me run all this way...

41:38.680 --> 41:40.265
Ooh, nice tattoo.

41:47.356 --> 41:48.941
Hey, Sister.

41:49.024 --> 41:51.861
Hey, this jukebox got anything
on it from Sound of Music?

42:07.002 --> 42:09.921
Hey, baby
What do I have to do.

42:10.005 --> 42:13.592
- Want to dance, Sister?
- Why? You don't have any rhythm.

42:13.675 --> 42:16.428
To make you love me too.

42:16.512 --> 42:19.598
- You got to roll with me, Henry.
- All right.

42:19.682 --> 42:22.101
Young man, take your foot
down off that stool.

42:22.184 --> 42:23.811
Now, have a seat.
Have a seat.

42:23.894 --> 42:27.106
- Baby. - Roll with me, Henry.
- Henry, hold on.

42:27.189 --> 42:29.609
- Sit down and shut up.
- Can I have a Coke, please?

42:29.692 --> 42:32.278
- Coming up.
- Thank you so much.

42:32.362 --> 42:34.447
Roll with me, Henry.

42:43.415 --> 42:44.666
Whoa, boy!

42:46.209 --> 42:48.128
What are you doin' in here?

42:54.051 --> 42:55.469
- I... - What are you doing?
- I thought you...

42:55.552 --> 42:57.304
What are you guys doing?

42:57.388 --> 42:58.973
Look, you have to go.
You have to go.

42:59.056 --> 43:00.349
- We...
- Oh, never mind. Go. Go.

43:00.391 --> 43:02.727
Just go that way.
Just go that way.

43:05.146 --> 43:08.566
Sister, expecting any more
of your friends?

43:10.151 --> 43:13.238
Now, you guys want to tell me
what you're doing here?

43:13.321 --> 43:15.407
Well, I-I thought that you might
be ministering to the winos,

43:15.490 --> 43:17.409
the way that you did
in your convent in Reno,

43:17.492 --> 43:18.910
and I thought I could help.

43:18.994 --> 43:21.246
And I saw her leave, and it was
very late, and so I followed...

43:21.329 --> 43:24.249
What are you doing here?

43:24.333 --> 43:29.254
- I'm here to see a man about a
car. For the convent. - Really?

43:29.338 --> 43:30.714
- Yes. - Did you get it?
- No, I didn't.

43:30.798 --> 43:32.049
- I'm gonna get you outta here.
- We could really use it.

43:32.132 --> 43:33.717
- What colour?
- Come on, come on.

43:33.801 --> 43:36.595
Oh, a jukebox.
Oh, one song, one song.

43:36.679 --> 43:38.598
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Do you have a quarter? Oh, one song, please.

43:38.681 --> 43:41.476
Come on. He does. All right. It'll
come back to you tenfold. Thanks.

43:41.517 --> 43:43.770
Hurry up. Hurry up.

43:46.189 --> 43:48.942
Oh, I love this song.

43:49.025 --> 43:51.111
Give me, give me, give me
Give me gravy tonight.

43:51.194 --> 43:52.779
What's the matter with you?

43:52.862 --> 43:54.406
One dance. I'll be
right back, please.

43:56.700 --> 44:00.203
But that don't show me
that you're really mine.

44:00.287 --> 44:03.749
Once they're dancing
when they're romancing.

44:03.832 --> 44:07.086
So put me something
extra on the line.

44:07.169 --> 44:10.256
- Gravy.
- On my mashed potatoes.

44:10.339 --> 44:11.757
- Give me.
- Gravy.

44:11.841 --> 44:14.093
Come on and treat me right.

44:14.176 --> 44:17.597
- Gravy.
- You're the greatest.

44:17.680 --> 44:20.767
So give me, give me, give me
Give me gravy tonight.

44:20.850 --> 44:22.602
All right.

44:22.685 --> 44:25.105
But I want some more.

44:25.188 --> 44:28.441
There's something missing
and we're on the floor.

44:28.525 --> 44:31.945
Come on, baby
I want some gravy.

44:32.028 --> 44:35.449
A little kiss
is what I'm waiting for.

44:35.532 --> 44:38.619
- Gravy.
- On my mashed potatoes.

44:38.702 --> 44:40.454
Come on. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, come on, come on.

44:40.537 --> 44:43.290
- Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Good night. - Come on!

44:43.374 --> 44:45.793
- Go, go!
- I love this song.

44:45.876 --> 44:47.962
We had a lovely time.
We'll be back.

44:48.045 --> 44:50.464
- Yes, we will. Good night.
- Bless you.

44:50.548 --> 44:52.300
You leaving?

44:52.383 --> 44:54.594
This turns into a nuns' bar,
I'm outta here.

44:54.677 --> 44:55.928
Yeah.

44:57.222 --> 45:00.809
- Oh, good grief.
- Just come on. Come on.

45:00.892 --> 45:02.602
Stop giggling. Let's go.

45:03.812 --> 45:05.230
Quiet. Shh.

45:17.952 --> 45:23.416
The sisters have made it clear to me that
they followed you of their own volition.

45:23.499 --> 45:26.419
But they would never have
ventured out at all at night...

45:26.502 --> 45:28.588
had it not been
for your example.

45:28.671 --> 45:31.758
But, listen, they just don't want to be
stuck behind these walls all the time.

45:31.841 --> 45:34.719
These walls are the only
protection they have.

45:34.803 --> 45:40.016
The streets are no longer safe for them,
and they are certainly not safe for you.

45:40.100 --> 45:44.563
These robes no longer protect
our sisters. The walls do.

45:44.646 --> 45:46.064
I'm sorry.

45:48.358 --> 45:50.736
You really do care
about them, don't you?

45:50.819 --> 45:53.197
Yes, I do.

45:53.280 --> 45:56.325
And I care about you
and your life.

45:57.743 --> 46:00.621
I shall ask Monsignor O'Hara
and Lieutenant Souther...

46:00.705 --> 46:03.875
to find a safer and more
suitable situation for you.

46:03.958 --> 46:06.002
Oh, no. Come on.
Don't send me away. Really.

46:06.085 --> 46:08.004
I mean, I'm just starting
to get the hang of this.

46:08.087 --> 46:12.217
I mean, look, I'm not gonna endanger
anyone or anything else.

46:12.300 --> 46:16.721
I swear. What about forgiveness?
Isn't that what you preach?

46:16.805 --> 46:18.557
There's got to be something
around here that I can do...

46:18.640 --> 46:21.893
that's not gonna chip my nails
or annoy anybody.

46:21.977 --> 46:24.021
You're right, Mary Clarence.

46:24.104 --> 46:28.233
To err is human,
to forgive divine.

46:28.317 --> 46:30.069
You may stay.

46:31.487 --> 46:35.074
But I shall restrict your
activities to a single task.

46:36.826 --> 46:38.786
What's that?

46:38.870 --> 46:42.081
Singing.
You will join the choir.

46:44.334 --> 46:45.919
Choir? No.

46:46.002 --> 46:47.921
You will sleep
and you will sing.

46:48.004 --> 46:50.590
That will be your task
until you leave.

46:50.674 --> 46:52.801
No. Uh, the choir?

46:52.884 --> 46:55.929
I mean, h-h-have you
heard them?

46:56.013 --> 46:59.099
The choir, Mary Clarence.

47:00.517 --> 47:02.102
Is this the choir rehearsal?

47:02.186 --> 47:05.231
It sure is.
Come on in, sing a spell.

47:07.149 --> 47:10.403
- Soprano or alto?
- Whatever.

47:10.486 --> 47:11.904
Thanks.

47:14.824 --> 47:16.242
- Hi, Sister.
- Hello, Sister.

47:16.325 --> 47:17.785
- Hello, Sister.
- 214.

47:27.045 --> 47:30.924
Crown Him with many crowns.

47:31.008 --> 47:34.261
The Lamb upon His throne.

47:34.344 --> 47:38.349
- All kingdoms.
- All kingdoms of the...

47:38.432 --> 47:40.851
Mary Clarence,
are you with us?

47:40.935 --> 47:43.604
I don't know this one.
I... I better...

47:43.687 --> 47:47.608
I better sit this one out.
Excuse me.

47:47.692 --> 47:50.695
Reverend Mother says Mary Clarence
has a background in music.

47:50.778 --> 47:54.449
Really, Mary Clarence?
Were you a choir mistress?

47:54.532 --> 47:59.788
- Sort of freelance.
- Freelance? Really?

47:59.871 --> 48:03.542
Oh. You don't think I see?

48:03.625 --> 48:05.877
You think
I took vows yesterday?

48:05.961 --> 48:07.379
I know what you're up to.

48:07.462 --> 48:09.715
You and Reverend Mother.

48:09.798 --> 48:11.467
Uh, what?

48:11.550 --> 48:13.052
You're a ringer.

48:13.135 --> 48:14.720
She brought you here
to replace me.

48:14.803 --> 48:16.263
Out with the old.

48:18.724 --> 48:20.559
Oh, could you help us,
Mary Clarence?

48:20.643 --> 48:21.894
Mary Lazarus,
you're terrific,

48:21.978 --> 48:23.229
but we could
really use some help.

48:23.312 --> 48:25.481
- Please. You've heard us.
- We're terrible.

48:25.565 --> 48:28.693
Please, do something for us.

48:28.776 --> 48:33.072
- Please.
- Well, there's a word for this.

48:33.156 --> 48:35.241
Mutiny.

48:35.325 --> 48:38.411
So, Mary Clarence,
you think you can do better?

48:38.495 --> 48:41.415
I believe
I'd like to see that.

48:41.498 --> 48:44.418
Go ahead, Sister.
Make 'em sing.

49:14.324 --> 49:15.742
Okay.

49:16.993 --> 49:18.537
Okay.

49:18.620 --> 49:21.582
Where are the basses?

49:21.665 --> 49:23.459
Oh, you should
be over here.

49:23.542 --> 49:25.753
Uh, and the altos?

49:25.836 --> 49:27.254
Where are you?

49:27.338 --> 49:29.423
Sister, why don't you join them?

49:29.507 --> 49:32.259
And sopranos, where are you?

49:32.343 --> 49:34.929
Oh, you've got
to come down this way.

49:37.348 --> 49:39.600
All right, uh...

49:39.684 --> 49:43.772
Basses, I-I want you
to give me a D.

49:43.855 --> 49:45.940
Altos, I want you to do
a third above that.

49:46.024 --> 49:47.275
Give me an F sharp.

49:47.359 --> 49:50.779
And sopranos,
uh, give me an A.

49:50.862 --> 49:53.448
Let me have Sister Alma
play it one time...

49:53.532 --> 49:55.784
so we all know
what we're gonna do,

49:55.868 --> 49:58.454
and, and we'll go
from there.

49:58.537 --> 50:01.373
Sister, will you give me
those, uh, notes, please?

50:07.046 --> 50:09.131
Okay? On three.

50:09.215 --> 50:11.300
One, two, three.

50:12.927 --> 50:15.179
Okay. Okay, okay. Okay.

50:15.263 --> 50:17.348
Very-Very nice.

50:17.432 --> 50:20.018
Sister, what... Would you, would
you come over here, please?

50:20.101 --> 50:22.896
Just slide right in here for me,
please. Right. Right here.

50:22.979 --> 50:26.983
- Um, that's a powerful instrument you have there.
- Thank you.

50:27.067 --> 50:29.486
But I think it's probably
a good idea...

50:29.569 --> 50:32.156
if we bring you down
out of the rafters.

50:32.239 --> 50:34.283
I mean, everybody wants
to be close to God.

50:34.366 --> 50:36.827
I'm just not sure
you can do it vocally.

50:36.910 --> 50:39.038
Okay, so I need you
to sing...

50:39.121 --> 50:41.332
an octave below
where you've been singing.

50:41.415 --> 50:42.667
Okey-dokey.

50:42.750 --> 50:44.335
And, Sister Mary Robert,

50:44.418 --> 50:46.609
could you, could you come
stand over here, please?

50:46.680 --> 50:49.799
Yeah, come on over.
I noticed that, uh,

50:49.882 --> 50:52.385
you're moving your mouth,
but nothing's coming out.

50:52.468 --> 50:55.680
So I'd like to just hear you
by yourself, if you don't mind.

50:55.764 --> 50:57.849
Sister Alma, could you
give me an A, please?

51:02.229 --> 51:04.398
Alma!

51:04.481 --> 51:06.400
Check your battery.

51:08.360 --> 51:10.320
Give me an A, please.

51:14.450 --> 51:15.993
Okay, wait a... Okay.

51:16.076 --> 51:18.913
- Um, try this.
- Mm-hmm.

51:18.996 --> 51:20.373
Close your eyes.

51:20.456 --> 51:23.876
Visualize yourself
in a room full of people.

51:23.960 --> 51:26.921
Lots of silverware, people
dropping stuff, talking loud,

51:27.005 --> 51:29.048
drunks, women with,
with trays going,

51:29.132 --> 51:30.884
"What are you gonna have?"

51:30.967 --> 51:34.054
Your voice has to carry
over the din.

51:34.137 --> 51:35.758
You have to get up over
all of that...

51:35.859 --> 51:38.016
to be heard in the back
of the room, where I'm sitting,

51:38.100 --> 51:40.143
listening, straining
to hear you.

51:40.227 --> 51:41.478
- Okay?
- Okay.

51:41.562 --> 51:43.772
Keep that in your mind
when we do this.

51:43.856 --> 51:46.608
Sister.

51:54.325 --> 51:57.912
- Sister, that's amazing.
- We call that an A with an attitude.

51:57.995 --> 52:00.957
That's what you need. You have to
put attitude in what you sing.

52:01.040 --> 52:04.085
You have to think about what you're
singing. It's not just quacking.

52:04.169 --> 52:06.588
This is...
This is rejoicing.

52:06.671 --> 52:09.591
You are singing
to the Lord.

52:09.674 --> 52:11.426
Let's review
those notes again...

52:11.510 --> 52:12.928
and see if we can
put it together.

52:13.011 --> 52:14.930
Sister.

52:16.348 --> 52:20.269
Basses. Altos. Sopranos.

52:20.352 --> 52:23.314
On three.
One, two, three.

52:29.028 --> 52:30.947
Oh, we did it.
We actually sang a chord.

52:31.030 --> 52:33.449
That was exciting.
That was exciting.

52:33.533 --> 52:36.119
Yeah, you sang a chord
for two seconds.

52:36.202 --> 52:39.956
The next thing you have to learn how
to do is listen to each other.

52:40.039 --> 52:42.125
That's a big key.
Big key.

52:42.208 --> 52:45.295
You must listen to each other
if you're going to be a group.

52:45.378 --> 52:49.466
- I knew that.
- Mary Lazarus, I...

52:49.549 --> 52:52.469
As soon as I walked in the door,
I knew that you knew this.

52:52.552 --> 52:56.807
Now, you're somebody who's into
hard work and discipline, aren't you?

52:56.890 --> 52:58.475
Of course. I'm a nun.

52:58.559 --> 52:59.977
Four Popes now.

53:00.060 --> 53:02.938
Four? Wow.

53:03.022 --> 53:04.940
How often do they rehearse?

53:05.024 --> 53:06.943
Twice a week,
a couple hours.

53:07.026 --> 53:08.611
Not enough.
I mean, listen to them.

53:08.694 --> 53:10.613
They really need
a lot of work.

53:10.696 --> 53:12.782
They gotta rehearse
every day.

53:12.865 --> 53:14.617
She's good.

53:14.701 --> 53:17.787
Well, do you think they
really could get better?

53:17.871 --> 53:20.123
I don't know.
They're pretty raw.

53:20.206 --> 53:21.666
Wet behind the ears.

53:21.750 --> 53:23.794
Oh, please, let us try.

53:23.877 --> 53:25.837
- Please.
- Please.

53:25.921 --> 53:27.506
This is gonna be hell.

53:27.589 --> 53:29.508
Tell me about it.

53:30.884 --> 53:34.430
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la.

53:35.556 --> 53:38.642
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la.

53:39.894 --> 53:43.439
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la.

53:44.565 --> 53:47.652
La, la, la, la
la, la, la, la, la.

53:47.735 --> 53:51.823
La, la.

53:54.242 --> 53:59.331
Welcome this Sunday morning,
oh, ye few, but faithful.

53:59.414 --> 54:02.167
The choir, I'm told,
has elected a new director,

54:02.250 --> 54:03.710
Sister Mary Clarence,

54:03.794 --> 54:07.297
who will lead them
in "Hail, Holy Queen."

54:21.145 --> 54:24.065
Hail, Holy Queen.

54:24.148 --> 54:26.776
Enthroned above.

54:26.860 --> 54:32.741
Oh, Maria.

54:32.824 --> 54:36.661
Hail, mother of mercy.

54:36.745 --> 54:39.665
And of love.

54:39.748 --> 54:44.753
Oh, Maria.

54:45.838 --> 54:50.676
Triumph all ye cherubim.

54:50.760 --> 54:56.474
Sing with us ye seraphim.

54:56.557 --> 54:58.518
Heaven and Earth.

54:58.601 --> 55:03.022
Resound the hymn.

55:26.088 --> 55:29.675
Hail, Holy Queen
enthroned above.

55:29.759 --> 55:32.678
Oh, Maria.

55:32.762 --> 55:36.182
Hail, mother of mercy
and of love.

55:36.266 --> 55:39.519
Oh, Maria.

55:39.602 --> 55:42.856
Triumph all ye cherubim.

55:42.939 --> 55:46.067
Sing with us ye seraphim.

55:46.151 --> 55:49.237
Heaven and Earth
resound the hymn.

55:58.789 --> 56:00.249
Hey, what do you think's
going on over there?

56:00.332 --> 56:02.501
I don't know, man,
but it sounds good.

56:02.585 --> 56:05.171
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

56:05.254 --> 56:08.174
Our life
Our sweetness here below.

56:08.257 --> 56:11.678
- Oh, Maria.
- Oh, Maria.

56:11.761 --> 56:14.514
Our hope in sorrow
and in woe.

56:14.597 --> 56:18.351
- Whoa, Maria.
- Oh, Maria.

56:18.435 --> 56:20.979
Triumph all ye cherubim.

56:21.062 --> 56:24.191
- Cherubim.
- Sing with us ye seraphim.

56:24.274 --> 56:28.320
- Seraphim.
- Heaven and Earth resound the hymn.

56:34.869 --> 56:41.459
Hallelujah.

56:54.097 --> 57:00.520
- Hallelujah.
- Hallelujah.

57:01.939 --> 57:05.317
Our life
Our sweetness here below.

57:05.401 --> 57:07.987
Oh, Maria.

57:08.070 --> 57:10.656
Our hope in sorrow
and in woe.

57:10.739 --> 57:14.619
- Whoa, Maria.
- Oh, Maria.

57:14.702 --> 57:17.079
Triumph all ye cherubim.

57:17.163 --> 57:19.665
- Cherubim.
- Sing with us ye seraphim.

57:19.749 --> 57:24.212
- Sweet seraphim.
- Heaven and Earth resound the hymn.

57:53.785 --> 57:56.579
Girl groups!
Boogie-woogie on the piano!

57:56.663 --> 57:58.581
What were you thinking?

57:58.665 --> 58:00.375
I was thinking
more like Vegas.

58:00.458 --> 58:03.003
You know, get some butts
in the seats.

58:03.086 --> 58:06.173
And what next?
Popcorn? Curtain calls?

58:06.256 --> 58:09.634
- This is not a theatre or a casino!
- Yeah, but that's the problem.

58:09.718 --> 58:12.554
See, people like going to theatres,
and they like going to casinos.

58:12.638 --> 58:14.681
But they don't like
coming to church. Why?

58:14.765 --> 58:17.017
Because it's a drag.
But we could change all that.

58:17.101 --> 58:19.228
See, we could, we could
pack this joint.

58:19.311 --> 58:21.021
Through blasphemy?

58:21.105 --> 58:23.899
You have corrupted
the entire choir!

58:23.983 --> 58:26.694
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Oh. - Excuse me.

58:26.777 --> 58:28.529
How can you say that? I...

58:28.613 --> 58:31.532
- I've worked my butt off with these women.
- Oh.

58:31.616 --> 58:34.452
They've given up their free time
to do this, and they're good!

58:34.536 --> 58:37.831
I mean, Sister, we could,
we could rock this place.

58:37.914 --> 58:42.544
Out of the question! As of tomorrow, Mary
Lazarus resumes her leadership of the choir.

58:42.627 --> 58:44.254
Come in!

58:45.672 --> 58:48.550
Reverend Mother, I just
wanted to congratulate you.

58:48.634 --> 58:51.095
I haven't enjoyed mass
this much in years.

58:51.178 --> 58:52.805
What a marvellous programme.

58:52.888 --> 58:55.891
Innovative. Inspiring.
You're to be commended.

58:55.975 --> 58:59.228
I can't wait till next Sunday
when the choir performs again.

58:59.311 --> 59:01.397
Did you see the people
walk right in from the street?

59:01.480 --> 59:04.108
That music.
That heavenly music.

59:04.192 --> 59:06.277
Reverend Mother,
it called to them.

59:07.236 --> 59:08.738
It... It did?

59:08.821 --> 59:10.156
I must tell the Archbishop.

59:10.240 --> 59:12.992
I'll send him a personal letter
describing your efforts,

59:13.076 --> 59:16.162
your bold, new flight to keep
your little convent alive.

59:16.246 --> 59:17.497
And you must also
include this.

59:17.581 --> 59:19.332
This is something she would
never tell you herself...

59:19.416 --> 59:21.835
because this is the kind
of woman she is.

59:21.918 --> 59:26.173
Sisters, she wants us to go out into
the neighbourhood and meet the people.

59:28.968 --> 59:32.012
- Oh, this woman.
- Oh, bless her.

59:32.096 --> 59:34.849
Oh, there are so many problems out there
that we could maybe help with.

59:34.932 --> 59:37.184
I mean, that's why
many of us became nuns.

59:37.268 --> 59:39.270
Oh, it's really marvellous,
Reverend Mother.

59:39.353 --> 59:42.148
- There's a lot we could do for them
besides pray, Sister. - That's right.

59:42.231 --> 59:43.858
You're a pioneer.

59:43.942 --> 59:49.531
Monsignor, surely you realize
how dangerous this neighbourhood is.

59:49.614 --> 59:52.325
And you will face
that danger head-on.

59:53.618 --> 59:55.954
- As if I could stop you.
- You couldn't.

59:56.038 --> 59:58.290
You have my complete support
in this matter.

59:58.373 --> 01:00:02.211
Anything you can do to revitalize
this neighbourhood would be a blessing.

01:00:02.294 --> 01:00:05.464
Don't you just love her?

01:00:05.548 --> 01:00:07.550
Praise you, Reverend Mother.

01:00:34.119 --> 01:00:37.539
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:00:37.623 --> 01:00:41.544
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:00:41.627 --> 01:00:45.548
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:00:45.631 --> 01:00:49.594
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:00:49.677 --> 01:00:53.306
Love has been on my mind
for some time now.

01:00:53.389 --> 01:00:57.227
But you've been
the missing link.

01:00:57.310 --> 01:01:01.231
With all that's been happening
All this has made me think.

01:01:01.314 --> 01:01:05.652
That love is not for keeps.

01:01:05.736 --> 01:01:09.698
- All I want is your love.
- All I need is promises.

01:01:09.781 --> 01:01:11.575
Once is never enough.

01:01:11.658 --> 01:01:15.245
- Open up your heart and let me in.
- Look no further.

01:01:15.329 --> 01:01:17.706
Love has got me crying.

01:01:17.790 --> 01:01:21.419
- Understanding my love.
- Just a touch.

01:01:21.502 --> 01:01:24.171
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:01:24.255 --> 01:01:29.177
- Just a touch of love, yeah. -Just a
touch of love Just a touch of love.

01:01:29.260 --> 01:01:32.597
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:01:32.680 --> 01:01:37.060
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:01:37.143 --> 01:01:41.022
Music will light
the fires of romance.

01:01:41.106 --> 01:01:44.526
That could be forever.

01:01:44.610 --> 01:01:48.781
You better bat down a lover
Someone to discover.

01:01:48.864 --> 01:01:53.619
That just a touch of love
is all I need.

01:01:53.702 --> 01:01:57.248
- All I want is your love.
- Come a little closer.

01:01:57.331 --> 01:02:01.294
- Once is never enough.
- Open up your heart and let me in.

01:02:01.377 --> 01:02:05.089
- Love is burning us up.
- Love has got me crying.

01:02:05.173 --> 01:02:08.968
- Understanding my love.
- Just a touch.

01:02:09.052 --> 01:02:12.764
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:02:12.847 --> 01:02:16.810
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:02:16.893 --> 01:02:20.689
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:02:20.772 --> 01:02:24.068
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:02:24.151 --> 01:02:28.656
- Just a touch of love. -Just a touch
of love Just a touch of love.

01:02:28.739 --> 01:02:32.660
- Just a touch of love Just a touch of love.
- Yeah.

01:02:32.743 --> 01:02:35.663
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:02:35.746 --> 01:02:40.668
- Give me your love, yeah. -Just a
touch of love Just a touch of love.

01:02:56.602 --> 01:03:00.314

01:03:00.397 --> 01:03:04.360
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:03:04.443 --> 01:03:08.322
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:03:08.406 --> 01:03:12.368
Just a touch of love
Just a touch of love.

01:03:12.452 --> 01:03:16.247
- Just a touch of love Just a touch of love.
- eels so right.

01:03:18.917 --> 01:03:22.379
Yes, the failing convent at
St Katherine's has truly come alive...

01:03:22.462 --> 01:03:24.756
thanks to the efforts
of its popular choir.

01:03:24.839 --> 01:03:26.842
What an amazing
turnaround story.

01:03:26.925 --> 01:03:30.887
This convent was once alienated
from its surrounding neighbours.

01:03:30.971 --> 01:03:33.056
- Now, as you can see, its doors are open
in an effort... - Vinny, get over here.

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:34.850
- To reach out into the community,
- What?

01:03:34.933 --> 01:03:37.227
Establishing facilities
like a day care centre...

01:03:37.311 --> 01:03:39.396
and a food kitchen
for the homeless.

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.732
- As a matter of fact, the enthusiasm...
- Vin, you've gotta see...

01:03:41.816 --> 01:03:43.567
- these cute nuns. - generated at
St Katherine's has resulted...

01:03:43.651 --> 01:03:45.736
- I'm shootin' pool.
- In a new sense of civic pride.

01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:47.405
- Babe, we should send them money.
- Why all the changes?

01:03:47.488 --> 01:03:48.740
- Well, the nuns I talked to...
- They're do-gooders.

01:03:48.823 --> 01:03:51.284
Attribute this reach-out
philosophy to...

01:03:51.367 --> 01:03:55.580
a new addition to the convent,
Sister Mary Clarence,

01:03:55.663 --> 01:03:58.583
who, unfortunately,
is a little camera shy.

01:03:58.667 --> 01:04:01.920
I'm gonna kill her.
I'm gonna kill her myself.

01:04:04.756 --> 01:04:06.717
In related news,
the Pope visits the U.S.

01:04:06.800 --> 01:04:08.719
And we'll have more on that
in just a moment.

01:04:12.848 --> 01:04:14.725
- Good... Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:04:14.808 --> 01:04:17.728
- Thank you so much.
- Good morning, Monsignor. - Good morning.

01:04:17.812 --> 01:04:20.190
- Good... Good to see you.
- Good morning. - Good morning.

01:04:24.819 --> 01:04:26.404
Hey, hey. What...

01:04:26.487 --> 01:04:28.239
Are you looking for me?
What are you doing here?

01:04:28.323 --> 01:04:30.950
- How come I saw you on TV?
- That was not my fault.

01:04:31.034 --> 01:04:34.079
These people just showed up. But it's
been really good for the convent.

01:04:34.162 --> 01:04:36.248
You're supposed to be
hiding out. Remember?

01:04:36.331 --> 01:04:38.125
Bullets flying
through the air at you.

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.752
- Ring a bell?
- Yes.

01:04:40.836 --> 01:04:43.380
But I can't talk about it now because
I have a show in five minutes.

01:04:43.463 --> 01:04:46.175
Listen to yourself. This is
not a career opportunity.

01:04:46.258 --> 01:04:49.678
You don't have to tell me that. This would
not be the place to begin a career.

01:04:51.222 --> 01:04:54.016
Hey, just promise me I won't see
you on the Letterman show, okay?

01:04:54.934 --> 01:04:56.185
Okay.

01:04:56.269 --> 01:04:58.437
Hey, I'm worried about you.

01:04:58.521 --> 01:05:00.648
I don't want to see
anything happen to you.

01:05:01.733 --> 01:05:04.319
Okay. You gonna
come to the show?

01:05:05.445 --> 01:05:07.655
Yeah, I'd love to.

01:05:11.117 --> 01:05:16.873
This Sunday's hymn is inspired
by the lesson of Mary Magdalene.

01:05:16.957 --> 01:05:20.669
Now, Mary Magdalene was
a young lady with a past.

01:05:20.753 --> 01:05:22.379
Oh, yes.

01:05:22.463 --> 01:05:24.882
And she was
no stranger to sin.

01:05:24.965 --> 01:05:27.635
She was no stranger
to practically anybody.

01:05:28.969 --> 01:05:31.389
Many condemned her.

01:05:31.472 --> 01:05:33.307
The whole neighbourhood, in fact.

01:05:33.391 --> 01:05:37.562
But one man
refused to do so.

01:05:37.645 --> 01:05:42.233
One man said, "Hey, now,
hold on. Wait a minute."

01:05:42.317 --> 01:05:46.071
Listen to the girl's story.

01:05:53.161 --> 01:05:57.082
- Hail, girls.
- Hail, Mary. What's up?

01:05:57.166 --> 01:06:02.046
Well, Jerusalem's become
a real drag. Everybody hates me.

01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:04.715
Uh-uh. Not that guy over there.

01:06:04.799 --> 01:06:07.218
Who? Him? They all
say he's different.

01:06:07.301 --> 01:06:09.387
They say he's really weird.

01:06:09.470 --> 01:06:13.558
We don't care what people say.
To us, he's always there.

01:06:13.641 --> 01:06:15.059
Really?

01:06:18.688 --> 01:06:24.069
Nothing you could say
could tear me away from my God.

01:06:24.152 --> 01:06:26.029
My God.

01:06:26.113 --> 01:06:29.241
Nothing you could do
'cause I'm stuck like glue.

01:06:29.324 --> 01:06:32.828
- To my God.
- My God
- My God

01:06:32.911 --> 01:06:36.540
I'm sticking to my God
like a stamp to a letter.

01:06:36.624 --> 01:06:40.252
Like birds of a feather
we stick together

01:06:40.336 --> 01:06:42.171
I'm telling you
from the start

01:06:42.255 --> 01:06:45.925
I can't be torn apart
from my God.

01:06:47.927 --> 01:06:51.181
Nothing you could do
could make me untrue.

01:06:51.264 --> 01:06:55.101
- To my God.
- My God.

01:06:55.185 --> 01:06:58.438
Nothing you could buy
could make me tell a lie.

01:06:58.522 --> 01:07:02.025
- To my God.
- My God
- My God

01:07:02.109 --> 01:07:05.904
I gave my God
my word of honour.

01:07:05.988 --> 01:07:09.408
- To be faithful.
- And I'm gonna.

01:07:09.491 --> 01:07:14.872
- You best be believing.
- I won't be deceiving my God.

01:07:16.374 --> 01:07:20.378
As a matter of opinion
I think He's tops.

01:07:20.461 --> 01:07:23.631
- My opinion is He's the cream of the crop.
- Cream of the crop.

01:07:23.715 --> 01:07:27.760
- As a matter of taste.
- To be exact.

01:07:27.844 --> 01:07:30.805
- He's my ideal.
- As a matter of fact.

01:07:30.889 --> 01:07:34.392
No muscle-bound man
could take my hand

01:07:34.476 --> 01:07:36.561
from my God.

01:07:36.645 --> 01:07:38.230
My God.

01:07:38.313 --> 01:07:41.733
No handsome face
could ever take the place.

01:07:41.817 --> 01:07:45.237
- Of my God.
- My God
- My God.

01:07:45.321 --> 01:07:48.741
He may not be
a movie star.

01:07:48.824 --> 01:07:52.662
- But when it comes to being happy.
- We are.

01:07:52.745 --> 01:07:54.497
There's not a man today.

01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:58.042
Who could take me away
from my God.

01:07:58.126 --> 01:07:59.669
Let's take it home, ladies.

01:07:59.752 --> 01:08:01.671
There's not a man today.

01:08:01.754 --> 01:08:05.091
Who could take me away
from my God.

01:08:05.175 --> 01:08:07.093
Give them some of that
deep-shoulder action.

01:08:07.177 --> 01:08:09.012
There's not a man today.

01:08:09.095 --> 01:08:13.475
Who could take me away
from my God

01:08:30.993 --> 01:08:32.828
I think Sister Mary Patrick
was the best.

01:08:32.912 --> 01:08:34.580
- You were wonderful.
- I wasn't very good.

01:08:34.663 --> 01:08:36.541
- You were fabulous.
- You were very good too. - Ladies.

01:08:36.624 --> 01:08:40.712
- I think...
- Ladies, you were fantastic.

01:08:40.795 --> 01:08:43.381
- Sisters, you did good.
- Fantastic. - Oh, I'm so excited.

01:08:43.465 --> 01:08:45.383
I can't wait till Sunday
when we sing.

01:08:45.466 --> 01:08:47.719
- I'd rather sing than do anything.
- It's better than ice cream.

01:08:47.803 --> 01:08:50.721
- It's better than springtime.
- It's better than sex.

01:08:50.805 --> 01:08:53.058
- Oh?
- No, no, I-I've heard, you know.

01:08:53.142 --> 01:08:55.644
Sisters, you're truly
an inspiration.

01:08:55.728 --> 01:08:58.898
And I've asked you here because
I bear remarkable news.

01:08:58.981 --> 01:09:00.483
Now try to remain calm.

01:09:00.566 --> 01:09:03.694
What I'm about to say is
nothing short of a miracle.

01:09:03.778 --> 01:09:05.779
Well, I didn't believe it
myself at first.

01:09:05.863 --> 01:09:08.323
Monsignor, for goodness sake,
what is it?

01:09:08.408 --> 01:09:12.703
Oh, I'm sorry, Sister. It's just that it's so
momentous, I'm still adjusting to the shock.

01:09:12.787 --> 01:09:15.038
The Pope...
the Pope himself...

01:09:15.122 --> 01:09:17.459
has heard of our choir
here at St Katherine's.

01:09:17.542 --> 01:09:19.877
And when he visits
San Francisco next weekend,

01:09:19.961 --> 01:09:22.214
despite his inordinately
busy schedule,

01:09:22.296 --> 01:09:25.634
he's requested a special concert
here on Sunday night.

01:09:25.716 --> 01:09:27.553
No. No.

01:09:27.636 --> 01:09:29.805
Oh, I'm dying. I'm dying.

01:09:29.888 --> 01:09:34.894
Oh, Sisters. Oh, Sisters,
this is indeed glorious news.

01:09:34.977 --> 01:09:38.064
Oh, Monsignor, we're-we're
both humbled and honoured.

01:09:38.147 --> 01:09:40.774
And on such a supremely
solemn occasion,

01:09:40.858 --> 01:09:44.112
I do feel a traditional
programme would be best.

01:09:44.194 --> 01:09:46.531
You mean "traditional"
like the old way?

01:09:46.613 --> 01:09:49.075
We're speaking of His Holiness,
Mary Clarence,

01:09:49.158 --> 01:09:51.243
not a neighbourhood block party.

01:09:51.327 --> 01:09:54.915
The pontiff commands
the utmost respect and humility.

01:09:54.998 --> 01:09:58.627
Your more secular entertainments
would be totally out of place.

01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:00.963
But-But, Reverend Mother,
everyone loves our new style.

01:10:01.004 --> 01:10:02.840
It's brought people
back to the church.

01:10:02.923 --> 01:10:06.427
And that's why he's coming. I mean, because
we're doing something new and different.

01:10:06.510 --> 01:10:09.305
Well, I feel this can be
settled by a simple vote.

01:10:09.388 --> 01:10:12.933
- A vote?
- Of course, Mary Clarence.

01:10:13.017 --> 01:10:14.435
A convent
is not a police state.

01:10:14.518 --> 01:10:16.771
I'm... I'm sure the sisters
are more than capable...

01:10:16.854 --> 01:10:20.108
of reaching a mature
and dignified consensus.

01:10:20.191 --> 01:10:23.111
Right. Now, all those in favour
of performing a programme...

01:10:23.194 --> 01:10:25.280
of time-honoured sacred music,

01:10:25.363 --> 01:10:28.283
a truly spiritual repertoire,

01:10:28.366 --> 01:10:29.951
raise your hands.

01:10:38.544 --> 01:10:40.796
All those in favour
of allowing Mary Clarence...

01:10:40.879 --> 01:10:45.134
to select a more worldly programme,
however inappropriate,

01:10:45.217 --> 01:10:47.011
raise your hands.

01:10:58.565 --> 01:11:00.650
The majority has spoken.

01:11:00.733 --> 01:11:03.403
Reverend Mother, as always,
you're a true leader...

01:11:03.486 --> 01:11:05.071
gracious and understanding.

01:11:05.155 --> 01:11:07.949
Oh, it's gonna be wonderful,
Reverend Mother. You'll see.

01:11:08.033 --> 01:11:11.078
I'm sure the presentation
will be a great success.

01:11:11.161 --> 01:11:13.080
Congratulations,
Mary Clarence.

01:11:16.333 --> 01:11:18.752
And congratulations
to you all.

01:11:22.173 --> 01:11:24.675
His Holiness. Now,
we've got to get busy.

01:11:28.513 --> 01:11:29.764
Come in.

01:11:31.516 --> 01:11:35.228
- You sent for me?
- You have a phone call.

01:11:35.311 --> 01:11:37.063
From who?

01:11:37.147 --> 01:11:39.566
Lieutenant Souther.

01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:41.067
Oh.

01:11:44.696 --> 01:11:46.573
Hello?

01:11:46.657 --> 01:11:49.117
Hey, Deloris. Great news.

01:11:49.201 --> 01:11:52.454
I pulled some strings. The judge
agreed to move up their trial.

01:11:52.538 --> 01:11:54.248
We'll be in court
in a couple days.

01:11:54.331 --> 01:11:57.877
Really? That soon?

01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.046
Forty-eight hours,
you're a free woman.

01:12:01.213 --> 01:12:02.924
Oh, gee, it's great.

01:12:04.175 --> 01:12:07.095
Yeah, well, that's...
That's great.

01:12:07.178 --> 01:12:09.305
Hey, well, don't thank me
or anything.

01:12:09.389 --> 01:12:11.099
No, Rea... No, I...
It is. No, thank you.

01:12:11.182 --> 01:12:14.602
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's... Thank you.

01:12:14.686 --> 01:12:16.104
Yeah.

01:12:16.187 --> 01:12:18.273
All right. Bye.

01:12:22.194 --> 01:12:25.948
Well, seems like your prayers
have been answered.

01:12:26.031 --> 01:12:29.743
Uh, I'm gonna be outta here
in a week. I'm leaving.

01:12:29.827 --> 01:12:31.787
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

01:12:31.871 --> 01:12:34.957
- That makes two of us.
- What do you mean?

01:12:35.041 --> 01:12:39.629
I have submitted my resignation
to Monsignor O'Hara, privately.

01:12:39.712 --> 01:12:42.966
I've asked to be relocated
as soon as possible.

01:12:43.049 --> 01:12:45.760
But why?

01:12:45.844 --> 01:12:48.304
I must go where
I can be of use.

01:12:50.056 --> 01:12:51.641
But there's...

01:12:52.893 --> 01:12:54.478
There's still so much
to be done here.

01:12:54.561 --> 01:12:56.646
Look, if it's about me,
I-I-I'm gonna be gone.

01:12:56.730 --> 01:12:58.482
Indeed.

01:12:58.565 --> 01:13:00.818
And after how long,
a few weeks?

01:13:00.901 --> 01:13:05.072
I have been here for years.
Well, too long, I suppose.

01:13:05.155 --> 01:13:06.740
I've become somewhat obsolete.

01:13:06.824 --> 01:13:09.910
But you don't have
to continue being obsolete.

01:13:09.994 --> 01:13:12.914
Look, everything that's happening here
is-is-is a good thing.

01:13:12.997 --> 01:13:14.874
Sister, you can still be
part of it.

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:17.085
A part of what?

01:13:17.168 --> 01:13:19.921
You know, Mary Clarence, it is
one thing to rabble rouse,

01:13:20.004 --> 01:13:22.674
to sweep into town
and declare a holiday.

01:13:22.757 --> 01:13:25.093
You've raised
the sisters' expectations.

01:13:25.176 --> 01:13:27.596
You've... You've excited
and confused them.

01:13:27.679 --> 01:13:31.099
They imagine this neighbourhood to be some
sort of delightful ongoing bake sale.

01:13:31.183 --> 01:13:34.686
Now, you and I know
things are not so simple.

01:13:34.770 --> 01:13:37.940
There'll be disappointments
and rude shocks.

01:13:38.023 --> 01:13:39.608
And you will have vanished.

01:13:39.692 --> 01:13:41.777
How fortunate.

01:13:41.861 --> 01:13:45.614
Look, I just got things going.

01:13:45.698 --> 01:13:49.660
You are a formidable woman.
You could keep this going.

01:13:49.744 --> 01:13:51.454
Could I?

01:13:51.537 --> 01:13:53.790
Even if I wanted to, no.

01:13:53.873 --> 01:13:56.125
I fear I am a relic.

01:13:56.209 --> 01:13:59.254
And I have misplaced
my tambourine.

01:13:59.337 --> 01:14:02.340
- Good day, Mary Clarence.
- But, Sister, I...

01:14:02.424 --> 01:14:04.217
Good day.

01:14:07.637 --> 01:14:09.431
Good day.

01:14:09.598 --> 01:14:12.392
- Don't peek. - How can I peek?
- You can look to the right.

01:14:12.476 --> 01:14:14.478
- That's right, don't peek.
- Where can I look?

01:14:14.561 --> 01:14:17.064
- You ready?
- You've got my eyes... - Ta-da!

01:14:17.147 --> 01:14:19.066
Crazy women.
What have you done?

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:20.985
- What is this?
- It's ice cream.

01:14:21.068 --> 01:14:23.070
- I know that, but...
- Well, it's a great big...

01:14:23.154 --> 01:14:26.073
cuddly bear hug of a thank-you
from us to you.

01:14:26.157 --> 01:14:28.242
- Not thank you to me, thank you to you.
- No, you.

01:14:28.326 --> 01:14:30.912
I mean...
When did you do this?

01:14:30.995 --> 01:14:34.249
This is a sin.
It's a wicked indulgence.

01:14:34.332 --> 01:14:36.418
Didn't they have
any butter pecan?

01:14:36.501 --> 01:14:39.337
- I hope Reverend Mother doesn't catch us.
- Yeah, let's keep it down.

01:14:39.379 --> 01:14:40.630
Is there any syrup?

01:14:40.714 --> 01:14:42.924
Mary Clarence,
this morning in prayers,

01:14:43.008 --> 01:14:45.427
I thanked God
for bringing you to us.

01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:48.097
Since you've come,
everything has just happened.

01:14:48.180 --> 01:14:50.432
Our choir is famous, for one.

01:14:50.516 --> 01:14:52.935
We could cut a demo.

01:14:53.018 --> 01:14:54.436
I could learn guitar.

01:14:56.689 --> 01:14:59.108
Yeah, anything is possible.
God works in mysterious ways.

01:14:59.191 --> 01:15:03.738
- That's true.
- You know, uh, anything could happen.

01:15:03.821 --> 01:15:07.575
I mean, any one of us could be transferred
out of here at any given time.

01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:10.412
Are you leaving us?

01:15:12.163 --> 01:15:13.915
No. Come on, no.

01:15:13.999 --> 01:15:17.419
What are you talking about? No,
we're always gonna be together.

01:15:19.171 --> 01:15:21.089
That's what Diana Ross said.

01:15:25.177 --> 01:15:27.429
Oh, well. Listen, that was
a trio. We're a quartet.

01:15:27.513 --> 01:15:29.139
- Listen. You know, it's true.
- I know that.

01:15:29.223 --> 01:15:30.933
- I believe in things like that.
- Okay...

01:15:31.934 --> 01:15:35.271
Just missed him.
Souther just stepped out.

01:15:35.354 --> 01:15:36.939
I need his signature
on some things.

01:15:37.023 --> 01:15:39.942
Uh, this stuff can't be
processed without him.

01:15:40.026 --> 01:15:43.279
Just leave it here, Henry. Uh, I'll
make sure he signs it when he comes in.

01:15:45.323 --> 01:15:46.992
Here.

01:16:09.807 --> 01:16:11.225
We found her.

01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:13.853
Beautiful work.

01:16:13.936 --> 01:16:15.271
What's the address?

01:16:15.355 --> 01:16:18.900
It's Church Street at 29th
in San Francisco.

01:16:20.318 --> 01:16:21.569
Thought you were gone.

01:16:21.653 --> 01:16:23.405
Get all the way
to the car, no keys.

01:16:23.488 --> 01:16:26.741
Tate said to leave
the money vouchers with him.

01:16:26.825 --> 01:16:28.910
He said you'd sign them later.

01:16:37.962 --> 01:16:39.713
St Katherine's.

01:16:44.677 --> 01:16:46.470
- Here's our leak, boys.
- Come on.

01:16:46.554 --> 01:16:48.055
Plug him up!

01:16:48.139 --> 01:16:50.683
- Get him outta here.
- Let's go, Tate.

01:16:51.517 --> 01:16:53.436
The Pope. Tomorrow.

01:16:53.519 --> 01:16:54.938
Oh, my gosh,
I'll be so nervous.

01:16:55.021 --> 01:16:56.940
What if I forget the words?

01:16:57.023 --> 01:16:59.109
You're gonna go
straight to hell.

01:16:59.192 --> 01:17:00.443
- I'm kidding.
- Uh... - I'm kidding. I'm sorry.

01:17:00.527 --> 01:17:02.571
Come on, Sisters.
Rehearsal in five minutes.

01:17:02.654 --> 01:17:05.324
- Go to rehearsal. I'll be there in a minute.
- Come on. - Right.

01:17:09.495 --> 01:17:10.746
Get in.

01:17:14.959 --> 01:17:18.254
One, two, three and slide.
One, two, three and slide.

01:17:18.337 --> 01:17:21.757
One, two, three and slide.
Sister, take over now.

01:17:21.841 --> 01:17:25.094
One, two, three, together.
One, two, three, together.

01:17:25.178 --> 01:17:29.599
One, two, three, together.
Left. Right.

01:17:29.682 --> 01:17:31.434
- Oh, come in.
- Where's Deloris?

01:17:31.518 --> 01:17:33.228
- Why? Is something wrong?
- They know she's here.

01:17:33.311 --> 01:17:36.106
- Girls... - Oh, my goodness.
She's upstairs with the choir.

01:17:41.862 --> 01:17:43.280
- Deloris.
- Hi.

01:17:43.363 --> 01:17:46.116
Look, Vince knows you're here.
We gotta get out now.

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.118
Oh, but I can't go. We're-We're
singing for the Pope tomorrow.

01:17:48.202 --> 01:17:51.622
Listen, you're gonna be singing for St Peter
if you don't get your ass outta here now.

01:17:51.705 --> 01:17:53.791
But I... Oh...

01:17:58.880 --> 01:18:00.631
I-I-I can't do this.
I can't leave.

01:18:00.715 --> 01:18:02.675
It's-It's... It's like
I'm deserting them.

01:18:02.759 --> 01:18:04.761
Hey, I think
they'll understand.

01:18:04.844 --> 01:18:07.180
No, you don't understand.
They need me.

01:18:07.263 --> 01:18:09.557
They need you?
A bunch of nuns?

01:18:09.641 --> 01:18:11.309
What for? Moral guidance?

01:18:11.393 --> 01:18:13.311
What? Make-up tips?

01:18:13.395 --> 01:18:16.064
Let me tell you something.
We are talking about the Pope.

01:18:16.148 --> 01:18:20.652
This means a great deal to them, and they have
worked very hard for this, and they deserve it.

01:18:20.736 --> 01:18:23.739
Where you going?
Where are you going?

01:18:23.822 --> 01:18:26.700
I am going to the little
nun's room, nosy.

01:18:49.683 --> 01:18:51.685
There you are.
We've been looking for you.

01:18:51.768 --> 01:18:53.937
- Shh, shh, shh. - Re-Rehearsal's about to start.
- Okay, okay, okay. Let's go.

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:56.356
- Surprise.
- Guess who?

01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.776
- Rehearsal's this way, Sisters.
- Hey, Deloris.

01:18:58.859 --> 01:19:00.569
- Hi. - Come on.
- All right, all right.

01:19:10.496 --> 01:19:12.707
What do they want?
Who are they?

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:15.210
Reno scum. Come on, man!

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:21.591
- Come on, come on! Let's go!
- All right, all right!

01:19:32.686 --> 01:19:34.313
Where are we going?

01:19:34.396 --> 01:19:36.774
Sister here has got
a special command performance.

01:19:36.857 --> 01:19:38.526
Yeah, back
at the Moonlight Lounge.

01:19:38.609 --> 01:19:40.194
Look, why don't you just
let her go, you know?

01:19:40.277 --> 01:19:41.988
She doesn't have
anything to do with this.

01:19:42.071 --> 01:19:44.448
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. So she can
run right to the cops, huh?

01:19:44.532 --> 01:19:47.910
Look, you just go
with the flow, okay?

01:19:47.994 --> 01:19:50.413
Relax. You do what
I tell you to do.

01:19:58.505 --> 01:20:02.092
- Go!
- Oh! Oh!

01:20:02.175 --> 01:20:04.428
- She's gettin' away.
- You don't even have to worry about her, okay?

01:20:04.511 --> 01:20:07.765
- You got the one you came for.
- She's right. Let's go.

01:20:09.183 --> 01:20:11.101
You all right?
It's okay, I'm a cop.

01:20:11.185 --> 01:20:12.978
They've got Sister Mary
Clarence, and they've got guns.

01:20:13.062 --> 01:20:14.605
- Where are they taking her?
- Um, they said the Moonlight Lounge.

01:20:14.688 --> 01:20:16.357
- Come on, get out of the street.
- Okay.

01:20:30.288 --> 01:20:31.790
- You mean they kidnapped her?
- Yes.

01:20:31.873 --> 01:20:33.792
Two men, and they had guns.

01:20:33.875 --> 01:20:35.710
Why would anyone kidnap a nun?

01:20:35.794 --> 01:20:37.295
Were they Catholics?

01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:40.299
She isn't a nun.

01:20:40.382 --> 01:20:44.053
She's a lounge singer. Her real
name is Deloris Van Cartier.

01:20:44.136 --> 01:20:47.806
She witnessed a vicious crime
and has been hiding in our convent.

01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:50.142
- She isn't a nun?
- She-She lied to us?

01:20:50.226 --> 01:20:51.977
But she was such
a wonderful nun.

01:20:52.061 --> 01:20:55.064
Look what she did with the choir.
She made us sing beautifully.

01:20:55.147 --> 01:20:58.651
- That should have tipped us. - Well, I don't
care who she is. We can't sing without her.

01:20:58.735 --> 01:21:00.820
- She's our inspiration.
- Right.

01:21:00.904 --> 01:21:03.782
Reverend Mother, please, I know
that you and Mary Clarence...

01:21:03.865 --> 01:21:05.450
didn't always agree,
but we've got to help her.

01:21:05.533 --> 01:21:07.202
- Please.
- We've gotta save her.

01:21:07.285 --> 01:21:10.789
- We can't leave it up to the Feds.
- No, they'll...

01:21:11.873 --> 01:21:13.291
Calm down, calm down.

01:21:13.375 --> 01:21:14.960
Mary Robert, think clearly.

01:21:15.043 --> 01:21:16.795
Have you any idea
who these two men where?

01:21:16.879 --> 01:21:21.717
Yes. They were from Reno, and they're
taking her to the Moonlight Lounge.

01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:25.137
Reno? Nevada.

01:21:25.221 --> 01:21:28.265
- Mary Emmanuel, tell the Monsignor the situation.
- Yes, Mother.

01:21:28.349 --> 01:21:30.643
- The rest of you, follow me.
- Yes, Mother.

01:21:31.978 --> 01:21:33.479
It's 1,500 for the run to Reno.

01:21:33.563 --> 01:21:35.315
That's 500 less
than I normally charge.

01:21:35.398 --> 01:21:37.650
But-But we don't have $ 1,500.

01:21:37.734 --> 01:21:39.819
Well, then I can't fly you
there. I'm sorry.

01:21:41.404 --> 01:21:44.032
Look, I-I'm sorry. I-I-I've got
things I have to check out here.

01:21:44.115 --> 01:21:47.494
Father, do not blame this young pilot
for abandoning us in our hour of need.

01:21:47.577 --> 01:21:49.496
When he stands before You
on the day of judgement,

01:21:49.579 --> 01:21:51.415
do not send him
straight to hell.

01:21:51.498 --> 01:21:54.710
Please, please, do not treat him with
the same disregard that he's treated us.

01:21:54.752 --> 01:21:56.670
Just because he can't
show charity to nuns,

01:21:56.754 --> 01:21:59.256
try not to leave him without
rewards when he asks for them.

01:21:59.340 --> 01:22:01.675
We know it is easier to answer
the prayers of a man...

01:22:01.759 --> 01:22:03.260
who has answered
the prayers of others,

01:22:03.344 --> 01:22:04.929
but if he should
come to You...

01:22:05.012 --> 01:22:08.266
- for relief of pain or...
- Such as rheumatoid arthritis,

01:22:08.349 --> 01:22:10.268
loss of hair, neck polyps.

01:22:10.351 --> 01:22:12.770
Don't leave him bald
and yowling in despair.

01:22:12.854 --> 01:22:15.190
Watch over him as he refuses
to watch over us.

01:22:15.273 --> 01:22:17.609
And if You cannot, we know that
You will have done Your level best.

01:22:17.692 --> 01:22:20.779
- What goes around, comes around.
- Look, Sisters, Sisters...

01:22:22.364 --> 01:22:24.074
Hold on a second.

01:22:42.718 --> 01:22:45.346
What did you think you were doing,
running to the cops, Deloris?

01:22:45.388 --> 01:22:48.516
Hiding out?
Big no-no, babe.

01:22:48.600 --> 01:22:50.518
Bet you're sorry now.

01:22:50.602 --> 01:22:53.438
I'm sorry
for all my sins, Vince,

01:22:53.521 --> 01:22:55.065
and I'm sorry for yours.

01:22:55.148 --> 01:22:57.651
I loved you, Deloris.

01:22:57.734 --> 01:22:59.820
I gave you everything:

01:22:59.903 --> 01:23:03.115
my affection, my time,
a big-time career.

01:23:03.198 --> 01:23:06.160
And how do you repay me?
What's the thanks I get?

01:23:06.243 --> 01:23:08.662
Where's the loyalty?

01:23:08.746 --> 01:23:10.956
You shouldn't have
done that to me, babe.

01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:13.918
You'll be judged.
We all will.

01:23:15.211 --> 01:23:17.255
I don't get judged.

01:23:17.338 --> 01:23:20.466
Vince, she's been acting weird
since we picked her up.

01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:23.469
It's like, uh,
she's scared of nothin'.

01:23:23.553 --> 01:23:25.013
She's scared.

01:23:25.096 --> 01:23:27.474
Tell the boys
how scared you are.

01:23:27.557 --> 01:23:29.643
I forgive you, Vince.

01:23:36.316 --> 01:23:37.985
Waste her.

01:23:47.912 --> 01:23:50.164
It's beautiful.

01:23:50.247 --> 01:23:53.334
And what a lovely name: Reno.

01:23:53.417 --> 01:23:55.503
And Gomorrah.

01:23:55.586 --> 01:23:58.339
No, she was this doll. She used to wear
this basket of fruit on her head and go...

01:23:58.423 --> 01:24:00.508
Excuse me, Vince.

01:24:00.592 --> 01:24:02.594
- Yeah?
- We didn't do it.

01:24:02.677 --> 01:24:05.430
- It's done?
- Uh, not totally.

01:24:07.098 --> 01:24:11.269
- What's the problem?
- Well, Vince, we can't waste a nun.

01:24:12.813 --> 01:24:14.940
What are you nuts
talking about?

01:24:15.023 --> 01:24:17.609
It's Deloris,
in a costume.

01:24:17.693 --> 01:24:20.279
Well, Vince, now how do you know
she didn't join up...

01:24:20.362 --> 01:24:22.448
and become a real nun
when she was there?

01:24:22.531 --> 01:24:23.991
Things like this happen.

01:24:26.869 --> 01:24:30.623
Because I know this woman,
in the biblical sense,

01:24:30.706 --> 01:24:32.458
and she ain't no nun.

01:24:32.542 --> 01:24:34.460
Now I don't want
to hear any more of this.

01:24:34.544 --> 01:24:35.837
Go in there and do it.

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.630
Just don't come back
till it's over.

01:24:37.714 --> 01:24:39.799
- Okay.
- It's done.

01:24:41.134 --> 01:24:43.470
Okay, we go
one, two, three, shoot.

01:24:43.553 --> 01:24:48.308
Wait. We don't go
one, two and shoot on three?

01:24:48.392 --> 01:24:49.977
Get over there.

01:24:54.732 --> 01:24:58.569
One, two, three.

01:24:59.904 --> 01:25:02.740
- You didn't shoot.
- Neither did you.

01:25:02.823 --> 01:25:05.076
I figured if, uh, you did,
I wouldn't have to.

01:25:05.159 --> 01:25:07.078
That's what I figured.

01:25:08.433 --> 01:25:10.415
Sisters, come on!

01:25:15.462 --> 01:25:17.923
Deloris, we got it
all worked out.

01:25:18.006 --> 01:25:19.424
- Hmm.
- Strip.

01:25:19.508 --> 01:25:20.759
What?

01:25:20.842 --> 01:25:22.427
Come on, come on.
Take off the, uh, nun thing.

01:25:22.511 --> 01:25:24.346
Yeah, yeah.
The nun thing.

01:25:24.429 --> 01:25:25.722
What is she doing?

01:25:25.806 --> 01:25:27.349
Oh, my God.
She's praying.

01:25:27.433 --> 01:25:31.520
Lord, I want you to forgive
Willy and Joey...

01:25:31.604 --> 01:25:34.940
because they know not
what they do.

01:25:35.024 --> 01:25:37.568
They're only doing what
Vince told them to do...

01:25:37.652 --> 01:25:40.613
because Vince is too chicken
to do it himself.

01:25:40.696 --> 01:25:44.617
So he's called upon these two men
to take care of his business.

01:25:44.701 --> 01:25:47.370
So I want you
to forgive them, Lord.

01:25:47.454 --> 01:25:50.957
Espectum, espertum,

01:25:51.041 --> 01:25:56.630
cacoomb, tutu, eplubium.

01:25:56.713 --> 01:25:58.465
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:26:00.551 --> 01:26:01.969
Ooh.

01:26:05.681 --> 01:26:08.434
Hey! Get out of my way!

01:26:08.517 --> 01:26:10.936
- Hey!
- Ow!

01:26:14.023 --> 01:26:15.817
You all right?
You all right?

01:26:34.086 --> 01:26:36.296
- Go-Go find Vince.
- Right.

01:26:39.883 --> 01:26:41.302
Wait, wait, wait!
Oh, my goodness!

01:26:41.385 --> 01:26:43.971
There it is!
The Moonlight Lounge! That's it!

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.412
Brace yourself, Sisters.

01:27:07.496 --> 01:27:10.415
Just spread out
and look for Mary Clarence.

01:27:10.499 --> 01:27:14.378
- Now, j... Try to blend in.
- Done.

01:27:14.461 --> 01:27:17.256
- Over here.
- Come with me, guys.

01:27:17.339 --> 01:27:18.716
Over this way.

01:27:21.177 --> 01:27:23.095
Hi. Excuse me.
Sorry.

01:27:23.179 --> 01:27:25.264
Has anyone seen a nun?
A Carmelite nun?

01:27:25.348 --> 01:27:27.266
- No? Sure? Okay, thanks.
- Wait. No, no, no, no, no.

01:27:27.350 --> 01:27:28.935
She's not really a nun.
See, she's just posing as a nun.

01:27:29.018 --> 01:27:30.770
It came as a great
shock to us.

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:41.406
Excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:44.785
- Place your bets.
- Red 23.

01:27:44.868 --> 01:27:46.787
- You're sure? - Mm-hmm.
- How do you know?

01:27:48.872 --> 01:27:51.125
- Red 23.
- Well, us too. - Here.

01:27:51.208 --> 01:27:54.295
- Works for me. - I'm on it.
- I'm in. I'm in. - All of it.

01:27:56.630 --> 01:27:58.090
Red 14.

01:27:59.592 --> 01:28:01.928
I was just trying
to teach you all a lesson.

01:28:03.751 --> 01:28:06.057
Oh! Excuse me!

01:28:06.140 --> 01:28:08.268
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

01:28:09.978 --> 01:28:11.604
Ah!

01:28:14.024 --> 01:28:15.901
Sister Mary Ignatius!

01:28:15.984 --> 01:28:17.402
Follow me.

01:28:27.705 --> 01:28:30.124
Block off the street, but don't
move in until I tell you.

01:28:30.207 --> 01:28:31.459
Okay.

01:28:31.542 --> 01:28:33.753
Nine! Pay the field. Nine.

01:28:33.836 --> 01:28:36.339
Pay the field.

01:28:36.422 --> 01:28:39.133
- Add the point...
- Come on. Stay with the others.

01:28:39.217 --> 01:28:41.135
- What are you doing here?
- Well, we're saving you. Move!

01:28:41.219 --> 01:28:45.974
- Move! - Mary Clarence, you're safe.
- What in the...

01:28:46.057 --> 01:28:49.144
Come on! Move! Move!

01:28:49.227 --> 01:28:53.398
- Break! Now! Break!
- Oh. - Hey, nuns.

01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:55.952
- Joey!
- Vinny, Vinny, there's a thousand nuns here!

01:28:56.005 --> 01:28:56.976
What do we do?

01:28:57.001 --> 01:28:58.868
You go to the right.
You go to the left.

01:28:58.898 --> 01:29:00.351
- I'm gonna go down the middle.
- All right.

01:29:03.534 --> 01:29:05.995
Place your bets.
Place your bets.

01:29:12.835 --> 01:29:15.254
Five black. Five.

01:29:23.054 --> 01:29:24.639
Hey, babe.

01:29:26.683 --> 01:29:28.351
Yes, sweetheart?

01:29:30.854 --> 01:29:34.608
No more bets. No more bets.
Fifteen black.

01:29:34.691 --> 01:29:37.653
- Seal off the exits and get ready to move in.
- Roger.

01:29:39.530 --> 01:29:41.782
There's another way out.
Let's go. Come.

01:29:41.866 --> 01:29:43.284
Excuse us.

01:29:55.171 --> 01:29:57.340
Come on. Out.

01:30:03.054 --> 01:30:04.890
- Move in now.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:07.559 --> 01:30:09.978
- Hey, uh, I can't see a thing.
- Willy, hit the lights.

01:30:14.233 --> 01:30:16.402
Freeze!

01:30:16.485 --> 01:30:17.987
Everybody!

01:30:19.572 --> 01:30:21.449
Joey.

01:30:21.532 --> 01:30:25.495
- Wh-Wh-Where is she?
- I'm right here.

01:30:25.578 --> 01:30:26.996
I'm here.

01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.998
Leave them alone. They don't
have anything to do with it.

01:30:29.082 --> 01:30:31.835
Just... I'm here.

01:30:35.255 --> 01:30:37.591
Calm down.

01:30:47.601 --> 01:30:49.520
Joey, do it.

01:30:49.603 --> 01:30:52.189
I can't, Vince.

01:30:52.273 --> 01:30:54.692
She's still a nun.

01:30:54.775 --> 01:30:56.360
She's a broad.

01:30:56.444 --> 01:30:58.529
You got it?
Just a broad.

01:30:58.613 --> 01:31:00.740
I guarantee you
she is no broad.

01:31:00.823 --> 01:31:03.284
She is Sister Mary Clarence
of St Katherine's Convent.

01:31:03.368 --> 01:31:06.454
She's a model of generosity,
virtue and love.

01:31:06.538 --> 01:31:09.249
You have my word for it,
gentlemen. She is a nun.

01:31:10.041 --> 01:31:11.626
You hear that?

01:31:11.710 --> 01:31:14.796
Now, aren't you glad
we didn't shoot her?

01:31:20.219 --> 01:31:23.013
- Don't shoot! - Drop it.
- Okay, okay, okay. - Right there! Let's go!

01:31:23.097 --> 01:31:25.641
- The gun's down, the gun's down. -Drop
your weapon! -All right, drop it! -Okay.

01:31:25.724 --> 01:31:27.977
- Lay it down right there!
- You all right? - Turn around.

01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:30.521
You okay? Oh, God.

01:31:33.733 --> 01:31:37.153
- I'm shot! Watch the arm!
- Are you okay?

01:31:37.236 --> 01:31:39.155
- Take it easy on me.
- Come on. - Sorry.

01:31:39.238 --> 01:31:42.325
- Things got kind of out of hand.
- Oh, just "kind of out of hand"?

01:31:42.408 --> 01:31:45.662
Boy, am I glad you're a much better
shot than you are a protector.

01:31:46.913 --> 01:31:50.459
But thank you.

01:31:50.542 --> 01:31:52.836
- All right, come on.
- I was good to you!

01:31:52.919 --> 01:31:55.088
- All right.
- We had a great thing! You sang in the hotel!

01:31:55.172 --> 01:31:56.673
- Come on.
- Badly!

01:31:56.757 --> 01:31:58.884
- In there.
- How could you betray me like this?

01:31:58.967 --> 01:32:02.471
- You are nothing! - Get him out of here.
- Right, Lieutenant.

01:32:02.555 --> 01:32:05.725
- I got two words for you, Vince.
- Mary Clarence.

01:32:07.685 --> 01:32:09.687
Bless you.

01:32:10.521 --> 01:32:11.814
- Just go.
- Come on.

01:32:11.898 --> 01:32:14.150
- Oh! Hey!
- We got another...

01:32:14.233 --> 01:32:16.611
I hold you responsible
for all of this.

01:32:16.694 --> 01:32:18.988
For introducing a lounge act
into my convent.

01:32:19.072 --> 01:32:20.991
For utterly disrupting our lives...

01:32:21.074 --> 01:32:23.827
and exposing us all
to mortal danger.

01:32:25.746 --> 01:32:27.039
Thank you.

01:32:31.084 --> 01:32:32.920
No, no, thank you.

01:32:33.003 --> 01:32:34.713
Thank you all.

01:32:36.257 --> 01:32:38.342
I'm really
gonna miss you guys.

01:32:38.425 --> 01:32:41.470
We thought you were
a nun, Deloris.

01:32:41.554 --> 01:32:44.724
- Yeah.
- Van Cartier.

01:32:48.770 --> 01:32:51.689
Sisters, we have
a concert to do.

01:32:51.773 --> 01:32:53.817
I thought you were leaving.

01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:56.361
We can't both of us leave.

01:33:13.879 --> 01:33:18.968
I will follow Him

01:33:20.219 --> 01:33:22.638
follow Him wherever.

01:33:22.722 --> 01:33:27.143
He may go.

01:33:28.895 --> 01:33:33.984
And near Him
I always will be

01:33:35.235 --> 01:33:40.490
or nothing
can keep me away.

01:33:40.574 --> 01:33:46.038
He is my destiny

01:33:47.915 --> 01:33:53.671
I will follow Him.

01:33:53.754 --> 01:33:57.508
Ever since
He touched my heart

01:33:57.592 --> 01:34:02.055
I knew.

01:34:02.138 --> 01:34:07.310
There isn't an ocean too deep.

01:34:08.562 --> 01:34:13.608
A mountain so high
it can keep.

01:34:13.692 --> 01:34:19.490
Keep me away.

01:34:22.076 --> 01:34:25.162
Away from.

01:34:25.246 --> 01:34:28.499
His.

01:34:28.582 --> 01:34:34.338
Love

01:34:41.971 --> 01:34:44.349
I love Him, I love Him
I love Him.

01:34:44.432 --> 01:34:47.728
And where He goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow

01:34:47.811 --> 01:34:50.522
I will follow Him

01:34:50.606 --> 01:34:54.693
follow Him
wherever He may go.

01:34:54.777 --> 01:34:58.322
There isn't an ocean too deep.

01:34:58.405 --> 01:35:00.866
A mountain so high
it can keep.

01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:03.953
Keep me away.

01:35:04.036 --> 01:35:06.873
- We will follow Him.
- follow Him

01:35:06.956 --> 01:35:09.751
follow Him wherever
He may go.

01:35:11.294 --> 01:35:14.464
- There isn't an ocean too deep.
- Too deep.

01:35:14.547 --> 01:35:16.966
A mountain so high
it can keep.

01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:20.136
Keep us away.

01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:22.973
Away from His love.

01:35:23.056 --> 01:35:25.475
- Oh, oh, yeah.
- I love Him.

01:35:25.559 --> 01:35:27.603
Oh, yes, I love Him.

01:35:27.686 --> 01:35:30.522
- I'll follow.
- I'm gonna follow.

01:35:30.606 --> 01:35:33.776
- True love.
- He'll always be my true love

01:35:33.859 --> 01:35:37.154
- Forever.
- from now until forever.

01:35:37.238 --> 01:35:39.657
- I love Him, I love Him, I love Him.
- Oh, yes, I love Him.

01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:42.577
And where He goes I'll follow,
I'll follow, I'll follow.

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:45.621
- I'll follow, yeah.
- He'll always be my true love - Oh, yeah.

01:35:50.251 --> 01:35:53.463
- There isn't an ocean too deep.
- An ocean.

01:35:53.546 --> 01:35:55.507
A mountain so high
it can keep.

01:35:55.590 --> 01:35:59.344
- Nothing can keep me away.
- Keep us away.

01:35:59.428 --> 01:36:05.100
Away from His love.

01:36:36.591 --> 01:36:38.176

When I used to be
nine years old.

Hey, yeah, and I was
