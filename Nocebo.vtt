WEBVTT

00:57.792 --> 00:59.293
Pbht.

01:02.429 --> 01:03.665
You're picking her up, right?

01:03.698 --> 01:05.432
I thought you said
you'd pick her up.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.268
I said I'd drop her off.
I drop her off, you pick her up.

01:08.302 --> 01:09.504
I dropped her off yesterday.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.806
And I picked her up.
See how it works?

01:11.839 --> 01:14.776
But I can't. I told you.

01:14.809 --> 01:16.243
Yeah. Hi.

01:16.276 --> 01:19.581
Bobs, Mommy's
picking you up, okay?

01:19.614 --> 01:21.849
You'll be brilliant.

01:21.883 --> 01:24.217
Love you.
Love you, too.

01:27.589 --> 01:30.490
Please stop worrying.
We've got this.

01:42.469 --> 01:43.838
Have a lovely day.

01:46.908 --> 01:48.308
Bye!

01:53.280 --> 01:55.215
Tell him he has to do
exactly as I explain.

01:55.248 --> 01:56.584
-Okay.
-So, we're gonna start

01:56.618 --> 01:58.418
with the girls first,
like you said, yeah?

01:58.452 --> 02:00.387
-Yeah, then the boys.
-Then the boys and then both.

02:00.420 --> 02:01.689
-That's right, isn't it?
-That's right.

02:01.723 --> 02:03.423
- Great.
- Hello, cheeky monkeys.

02:04.759 --> 02:06.594
-Snip those threads, will you?
-Yeah.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.764
Eyes up here.
Great.

02:11.766 --> 02:13.166
Gorgeous.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.605
Okay.

02:18.773 --> 02:19.607
Chocolate?

02:21.274 --> 02:24.211
Replacement top
for Augustus Gloop here.

03:01.916 --> 03:03.483
I have to take this.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.824
Couldn't this have waited?

03:09.857 --> 03:11.491
I'm in the middle of the sh--

03:16.664 --> 03:18.633
Oh, my God.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.572
Pulling out bodies?

03:31.612 --> 03:34.649
Yeah, I-I'm still here.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.656
Uh, I can't process this
right now.

03:41.689 --> 03:44.025
I-I can't listen
to this right now.

03:44.058 --> 03:45.993
I can't. I --

03:46.027 --> 03:48.863
I'll have to call you back.
Sorry.

03:48.896 --> 03:50.363
I'll call.

06:49.710 --> 06:52.546
Big Bird is coming
to school with me today.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.148
No, don't let him out again.

06:55.482 --> 06:58.686
-He goes back in.
-Yeah, after we catch him.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.187
One day he'll fly
out the window.

07:01.722 --> 07:03.758
Oh. Oh!

07:03.791 --> 07:06.227
Relax, Mom. Jesus.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.528
Don't use bad language.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.630
"Jesus" isn't bad language.

07:09.664 --> 07:11.464
It's just a guy's name.

07:11.498 --> 07:15.536
"Shit" is bad language.
You say "shit" all the time.

07:18.072 --> 07:19.607
Jesus.

07:22.877 --> 07:24.912
- Hi, Ian.
- Morning, Christine.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.214
I'll pick you up later.

07:27.248 --> 07:28.481
Love you.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.686
Thanks.
Have a good day.

07:35.056 --> 07:36.190
Shit.

07:57.578 --> 08:01.716
Lucky shoes, lucky shoes,
make me win and never lose.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.091
How have you been,
anyway, Christine?

09:17.124 --> 09:18.893
After everything.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.097
After everything?

09:23.130 --> 09:24.231
Mm-hmm.

09:28.269 --> 09:30.905
Well, I'm -- I'm fine, you know.

09:30.938 --> 09:34.942
Now just, um, keen
to get back in the saddle.

09:34.975 --> 09:36.844
Mm.

09:37.912 --> 09:40.815
Didn't you source manufacturers
yourself last time?

09:40.848 --> 09:42.783
Traveled the world.

09:42.817 --> 09:44.685
It provided inspiration,
actually.

09:44.718 --> 09:47.321
A one-woman band.
A lot to take on.

09:47.354 --> 09:48.689
A lot of pressure.

09:48.722 --> 09:51.225
Yeah, well, there was that.

10:01.435 --> 10:04.071
We want to drop a new line
very soon.

10:04.105 --> 10:07.041
You know how it is.
Turnover, turnover, turnover.

10:07.074 --> 10:07.942
Yeah.

10:09.343 --> 10:11.011
Could these...

10:12.012 --> 10:13.147
Could these?

10:16.183 --> 10:18.185
It's lovely work, Christine.

10:36.871 --> 10:37.872
Shit.

11:02.396 --> 11:04.965
- Hello?
- Hi. It's me.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.934
I'm back.
I've just landed.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.837
Landed. Good. Listen.

11:09.870 --> 11:12.706
C-Could you get Bobs?
I have the shakes again.

11:12.740 --> 11:15.009
- You at the house?
- No, no, I'll make it home.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.745
You're in the car?
Be careful, Christine.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.980
Sorry. Yeah, I know.
Just pick her up, will you?

11:20.014 --> 11:21.949
Okay. Okay.
I'll connect with her now.

11:21.982 --> 11:23.417
Okay. See you later.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.036
"It's lovely work, Christine."

11:44.171 --> 11:46.073
Condescending bitch.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.452
Liz, hi.

11:58.485 --> 12:00.254
Are you home?

12:00.287 --> 12:01.956
Yeah, I'm just back.

12:01.989 --> 12:04.058
Listen,
we really like your line.

12:04.091 --> 12:05.527
We'd need some changes, though,

12:05.560 --> 12:07.828
alterations
to some of the pieces.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.797
You wouldn't have to worry
about manufacturing

12:09.830 --> 12:11.232
if we ran with your range.

12:11.265 --> 12:13.234
We have a super-reasonable
operation in India.

12:13.267 --> 12:16.036
I just need you to throw
your hat in the ring.

12:16.070 --> 12:18.939
- This is great, Liz.
- It's not a done deal.

12:18.973 --> 12:21.242
It's an offer to pitch.
You'd have to work fast.

12:21.275 --> 12:23.043
Yeah, yeah, I understand.

12:23.077 --> 12:26.347
But if the alterations
I suggested can be done quickly,

12:26.380 --> 12:28.415
well, I think you're
really gonna be a shout.

12:28.449 --> 12:29.783
Thank you.

12:29.817 --> 12:31.318
It's the chance
I was hoping for.

12:31.352 --> 12:32.886
I'll be in touch
with the deets.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.855
I have to go.
Just wanted to let you know.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.223
I really appreciate it.

12:36.257 --> 12:37.525
Ta-ta, then.

12:37.559 --> 12:38.859
Bye for now.

12:59.413 --> 13:00.881
Hi.

13:02.617 --> 13:04.285
Can I help you?

13:05.386 --> 13:06.987
Hello, Christine.

13:08.289 --> 13:10.324
Sorry.
Do we know each other?

13:10.357 --> 13:12.226
I'm Diana.

13:15.229 --> 13:16.564
Diana.

13:16.598 --> 13:18.399
I'm here to help you.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.268
Goodness, Diana.

13:21.302 --> 13:23.337
Yes. You sent for me.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.273
You said come here
and start today.

13:26.307 --> 13:27.575
I did, didn't I?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.044
Yes.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.348
I forgot.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.551
I completely forgot.
I've been so --

13:36.584 --> 13:38.285
You're very busy, Christine.

13:38.319 --> 13:40.487
- Yeah.
- You have so much to do.

13:40.522 --> 13:42.356
- I do.
- You need my help.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.957
Yeah. You're here.

13:47.094 --> 13:48.262
Great.

13:48.295 --> 13:50.130
It's nice to meet you,
Christine.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.200
Lovely to meet you.

13:54.335 --> 13:55.903
Please come in, Diana.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.446
The house is so big.

14:06.581 --> 14:10.017
Yeah, there's a lot of it,
I suppose.

14:10.050 --> 14:12.052
It's very beautiful.

14:13.087 --> 14:15.089
Where will I stay, Christine?

14:17.257 --> 14:20.595
God, this is --
this is terrible.

14:20.628 --> 14:24.231
I've been having trouble with my
memory, but nothing like this.

14:24.264 --> 14:26.266
I haven't even prepared a room.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.904
Oh, I know.
Follow me.

14:45.986 --> 14:47.488
Is your daughter here?

14:49.289 --> 14:50.625
No, she's at school.

14:50.658 --> 14:52.660
Her dad will pick her up later
on his way home.

14:52.694 --> 14:55.028
She looks sweet.

14:55.062 --> 14:58.065
She <i>looks</i> sweet, yes.

15:15.249 --> 15:17.652
That's the studio where I work.

15:18.586 --> 15:20.522
And this could be your room.

15:24.491 --> 15:28.596
Okay.
I'll need to tidy up.

15:28.630 --> 15:31.131
I've got linen for the bed.

15:31.165 --> 15:33.000
It's very pretty.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.201
It is?

15:35.202 --> 15:36.671
We will make it pretty.

16:17.712 --> 16:19.379
Exemplary work.

16:20.815 --> 16:23.317
Well, I'll let you unpack
and put your things away.

16:23.350 --> 16:25.352
Come down when you're finished.

19:20.394 --> 19:21.696
Wow.

19:22.697 --> 19:24.832
That's quite something
to forget.

19:24.866 --> 19:27.200
I know. I know.

19:27.234 --> 19:28.936
Is there anything else
I should know about?

19:28.970 --> 19:30.938
Have you got any
long-lost relatives turning up

19:30.972 --> 19:32.540
or taken in any refugees?

19:34.241 --> 19:34.942
Diana.

19:36.744 --> 19:38.513
Meet Felix and Bobs.

19:38.546 --> 19:41.248
-Hello.
-Nice to meet, Diana.

19:41.949 --> 19:43.885
Certainly interesting, anyway.

19:44.986 --> 19:46.453
Hello, Bobs.

19:46.486 --> 19:49.322
Only my friends call me Bobs.

19:49.356 --> 19:50.925
You should call me Roberta.

19:52.026 --> 19:54.595
-Don't be rude, Bobs.
-It's okay.

19:54.629 --> 19:57.264
I will call you Roberta
because we are not friends yet.

20:02.469 --> 20:04.371
She'll get used to the idea.

20:04.404 --> 20:05.506
Me too, I hope.

20:06.473 --> 20:07.875
He's joking.

20:08.810 --> 20:10.845
So, whereabouts in the
Philippines are you from, Diana?

20:10.878 --> 20:13.313
I am from Cebu City.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.816
Did you grow up there?

20:14.849 --> 20:16.784
No, more south.

20:16.818 --> 20:18.385
You know the Philippines?

20:21.321 --> 20:22.623
Where south?

20:23.624 --> 20:25.760
You know?

20:25.793 --> 20:28.462
Uh, no.

20:28.495 --> 20:29.664
Is it one of the islands?

20:29.697 --> 20:31.999
It's a very special place,
Felix.

20:32.033 --> 20:34.001
Right.

20:34.035 --> 20:35.636
Well, Diana, I have to confess,

20:35.670 --> 20:38.039
this is a bit
of a surprise for me.

20:38.072 --> 20:40.541
I forgot to let Felix know
you were coming.

20:42.710 --> 20:43.778
We'll talk later.

20:44.746 --> 20:45.947
I'm gonna take a shower.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.556
He -- He's tired.

20:55.590 --> 20:58.492
He, um -- He's been traveling,
his work.

20:59.627 --> 21:00.795
I can cook dinner.

21:00.828 --> 21:02.630
You've only just arrived.

21:02.663 --> 21:03.931
It's okay.

21:03.965 --> 21:05.967
Please, Christine.
Something very nice.

21:07.068 --> 21:08.503
Straight to work, eh?

21:09.103 --> 21:11.973
Yes.
Straight to work, Christine.

21:53.948 --> 21:55.817
Look, Chrissy,
I'm just trying

21:55.850 --> 21:57.652
to keep our shit together, okay,

21:57.685 --> 21:59.452
so that weird stuff
doesn't happen,

21:59.486 --> 22:02.089
like some stranger turning up
to live in our house.

22:02.123 --> 22:04.926
Okay.
So you're right. I'm not coping.

22:04.959 --> 22:08.395
Work is gonna get busy again,
so I've changed my mind.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.664
Is that allowed?

22:09.697 --> 22:12.133
I'm allowed to change my mind,
right?

22:12.166 --> 22:14.735
I see the light
and agree with you, Felix.

22:14.769 --> 22:16.504
Happy?

22:16.537 --> 22:18.706
-How much is she getting paid?
-I don't know right now.

22:18.739 --> 22:20.608
-Oh, come on.
-Felix, you're stressing me.

22:20.641 --> 22:21.943
I have to work.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.049
Alright, we'll give it --
we'll give it a week, okay?

22:29.116 --> 22:30.518
One week.

23:55.970 --> 23:58.005
Oh, my God, Diana.
It's delicious.

23:58.039 --> 23:59.907
It is called humba.

24:01.008 --> 24:02.877
I don't want Chinese food.

24:02.910 --> 24:06.013
Diana is from
the Philippines, Bobs. Eat up.

24:06.047 --> 24:08.783
She doesn't have to
if she doesn't want to.

24:08.816 --> 24:10.851
I can make something else
for Roberta.

24:10.885 --> 24:12.653
No, no, she's fine
with what she has.

24:14.889 --> 24:16.090
Mmm.

24:16.123 --> 24:17.692
Do you like it, Felix?

24:20.795 --> 24:22.930
You don't really hear
about Philippine food, do you?

24:23.898 --> 24:26.067
Well, Filipino restaurants,
anyway.

24:26.100 --> 24:27.500
The culture of those islands

24:27.535 --> 24:28.769
is definitely
a neglected market.

24:28.803 --> 24:31.105
Felix is a marketing consultant.

24:31.138 --> 24:32.606
Marketing strategist.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.542
Oh, excuse me.
Strategist.

24:34.575 --> 24:35.609
Thank you.

24:37.078 --> 24:39.613
Mmm.

24:39.647 --> 24:40.982
No, this is good.

24:42.049 --> 24:43.651
Very good.
Surprisingly good.

24:43.684 --> 24:45.019
There is more.

24:48.289 --> 24:49.190
What?

24:50.758 --> 24:52.693
"Surprisingly good."

24:52.727 --> 24:53.828
Oh, Jesus.

24:54.862 --> 24:56.030
Bad word, Mom.

24:57.798 --> 24:59.734
It's just a guy's name,
remember?

25:03.070 --> 25:05.239
Oh. Ohh.

25:08.142 --> 25:10.611
You okay?
You alright?

25:12.713 --> 25:14.548
You okay?
Come on. Let's get you up.

25:14.582 --> 25:16.584
Huh?

25:16.617 --> 25:18.052
- Can I help?
- No, no.

25:18.085 --> 25:20.087
She just needs rest is all.
We know what to do.

25:20.121 --> 25:21.188
Oh!

25:21.222 --> 25:22.656
Can I try?

25:23.691 --> 25:26.193
It's okay.
I can help.

25:30.798 --> 25:34.135
It's okay. It's okay.
I make it go away.

26:12.907 --> 26:14.975
Diana, what the hell?

26:15.009 --> 26:16.577
Did it go away?

26:23.317 --> 26:24.785
Yeah.

26:26.253 --> 26:28.022
It's gone.

26:30.391 --> 26:32.960
It's gone.

26:34.695 --> 26:37.331
My eyes feel so heavy, Daddy.

26:37.364 --> 26:38.966
Come on, sleepy head.

26:44.271 --> 26:46.273
Good night, Roberta.

26:59.687 --> 27:01.722
Bobs was straight off to sleep.

27:04.091 --> 27:05.793
Didn't even want a story.

27:10.998 --> 27:12.166
Come in.

27:14.268 --> 27:16.070
Do you need anything?

27:19.039 --> 27:21.709
Oh, God, no, Diana.

27:21.742 --> 27:24.345
The fire, the spellbinding meal.

27:24.378 --> 27:26.747
You've done more than enough.

27:26.780 --> 27:29.150
I haven't felt so limber
since I don't know when.

27:32.786 --> 27:33.854
Pardon?

27:34.788 --> 27:37.057
It's a simple cure from my home.

27:38.359 --> 27:39.693
Could you do it for me?

27:40.728 --> 27:42.730
You can do it for each other.

27:45.966 --> 27:48.269
You used to tickle me
all the time.

27:49.403 --> 27:51.105
Yeah, well, that was then.

27:51.138 --> 27:52.706
What was when?

27:54.509 --> 27:57.778
Well, sometimes I'm not sure
you want to be tickled anymore.

33:10.592 --> 33:11.759
Bobs?

33:11.793 --> 33:15.095
Good morning.
It's Diana.

33:18.265 --> 33:20.033
Chrissy.

33:20.067 --> 33:21.301
Chrissy.

33:22.504 --> 33:24.171
It's Diana.

33:28.208 --> 33:29.744
What is it, Diana?

33:29.777 --> 33:32.479
I have breakfast in bed for you.

33:36.751 --> 33:38.786
Okay.

33:38.820 --> 33:40.420
Thank you.

33:49.096 --> 33:52.199
Turning this place
into a five-star hotel, Diana.

33:54.401 --> 33:56.203
Thank you.

34:00.374 --> 34:03.076
I haven't seen that
tribal eggs thing in ages.

34:04.311 --> 34:06.781
You have so many things here.

34:06.814 --> 34:09.181
The old sewing machine
is very beautiful.

34:09.216 --> 34:11.251
Yeah, I miss using that.

34:11.284 --> 34:12.754
I just design now.

34:12.786 --> 34:14.822
You don't make the clothes?

34:14.856 --> 34:18.592
No, I need my little helpers
for that.

34:18.626 --> 34:20.562
Who are your little helpers?

34:28.636 --> 34:30.638
It's a bit early
for questions, Diana.

34:31.839 --> 34:34.341
Thank you for the breakfast.
You're very thoughtful.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.744
But coming in here
is kind of intrusive.

34:36.777 --> 34:40.080
We usually have breakfast
downstairs, okay?

34:47.889 --> 34:49.657
Okay, you can go now, Diana.

34:50.692 --> 34:51.793
Hm.

35:13.681 --> 35:15.282
Don't be like that, Bobs.

35:15.315 --> 35:18.418
I need Diana to see the route
to your school.

35:18.452 --> 35:20.822
Anyway, it's against the bloody
law, so stay in the back.

35:20.855 --> 35:23.725
Daddy lets me sit up front.

35:23.758 --> 35:24.692
Does he?

35:25.760 --> 35:28.261
Well, not whilst he's driving.

35:28.295 --> 35:30.163
I'm going to be driving,
so stay in the back

35:30.197 --> 35:31.633
and put on your belt.

35:36.370 --> 35:37.404
Mom.

35:39.841 --> 35:41.542
Yes?

35:41.576 --> 35:43.176
I saw footprints.

35:43.210 --> 35:44.679
Footprints?

35:44.712 --> 35:47.782
Like mine but someone else's.

35:47.815 --> 35:49.182
Okay.

35:50.752 --> 35:52.319
Let's go.

36:12.239 --> 36:14.341
You're going the wrong way, Mom.

36:15.442 --> 36:16.343
Was I?

36:33.460 --> 36:34.629
I must have taken --

36:35.997 --> 36:38.599
Oh, I can't remember.

36:39.834 --> 36:40.935
We should walk.

36:42.570 --> 36:45.006
I will learn the way to
the school better if we walk.

36:45.039 --> 36:46.373
Hmm?

36:48.943 --> 36:51.979
Roberta, show us the way, yes?

37:11.532 --> 37:13.500
Will Daddy get me later?

37:15.002 --> 37:16.537
Diana will.

37:26.914 --> 37:29.584
Jesus, I can't even call a cab.

37:29.617 --> 37:30.852
Let me.

37:32.854 --> 37:35.590
I was feeling great
this morning.

37:35.623 --> 37:37.290
I just want this to stop.

37:38.458 --> 37:39.292
I can help.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.362
I don't think tickling
will do any good.

37:42.395 --> 37:44.532
No, not tickles anymore.

37:55.576 --> 37:58.311
This is just different medicine,
Christine.

38:01.115 --> 38:04.786
Not sure if that smells nice.
Awful.

38:23.470 --> 38:24.939
What are you doing now?

38:26.107 --> 38:30.410
The dirt in the water is
bad stuff from you, Christine.

38:30.443 --> 38:33.714
When the water becomes clean,
the bad stuff is gone from you.

38:33.748 --> 38:36.083
- Seriously?
- Yes.

38:36.117 --> 38:37.819
Now you just trust me, okay?

38:39.053 --> 38:40.353
Okay.

39:20.928 --> 39:21.963
You see?

39:32.573 --> 39:34.909
This is a folk remedy, right?

39:34.942 --> 39:37.078
Does everyone know this stuff
or just you?

39:39.180 --> 39:41.515
I'll tell you
if you want to know.

39:41.549 --> 39:43.684
-You want to know?
-Mm-hmm.

39:54.028 --> 40:00.735
One day when I was small,
there was a terrible storm.

40:05.039 --> 40:08.542
An old woman came to our house
for help.

40:12.546 --> 40:15.082
This woman was an umu.

40:18.819 --> 40:23.958
If you believe like we did,
an umu has great power.

40:23.991 --> 40:27.628
It can heal you
or it can destroy you.

40:28.829 --> 40:31.966
But this umu was very weak.

40:34.501 --> 40:36.537
I went to the umu.

40:37.071 --> 40:38.940
I saw her dying.

40:41.075 --> 40:43.611
When an umu dies,

40:43.644 --> 40:46.847
its soul jumps out
and goes into another person,

40:46.881 --> 40:48.149
taking them.

40:50.284 --> 40:53.521
You should never be with an umu
when it dies.

40:54.555 --> 40:56.157
But I was with her.

41:13.941 --> 41:16.610
I felt different after that.

41:16.644 --> 41:18.546
I understood the world.

41:19.213 --> 41:22.883
The plants, the stones,
the water.

41:24.919 --> 41:27.621
I understood their power.

41:29.023 --> 41:31.025
I felt guided.

41:48.275 --> 41:52.246
We were poor, so my parents
used my gift for money.

41:55.950 --> 41:57.918
People needed me.

41:57.952 --> 41:59.920
But they were afraid of me.

42:03.324 --> 42:07.762
They were afraid of the power
that can heal or destroy.

42:09.964 --> 42:12.533
That power was inside me.

42:15.836 --> 42:17.538
I was the umu.

42:21.742 --> 42:24.745
I'm not sure I should
believe that story.

42:26.213 --> 42:29.784
What is important
is you believe in the medicine.

42:29.817 --> 42:32.920
Believing is important.

42:32.953 --> 42:34.155
Trust also.

42:36.991 --> 42:37.892
Stand up.

42:45.099 --> 42:46.133
Move your body.

42:55.342 --> 42:57.144
The shakes are gone.

42:58.779 --> 43:03.084
It feels like a fog has lifted.

43:04.952 --> 43:06.220
Oh.

43:07.788 --> 43:09.623
Sorry.

43:09.657 --> 43:11.792
I'm just grateful.

43:11.826 --> 43:14.695
You rest now.
It's not forever.

43:14.728 --> 43:18.632
No, I-I can't.
I-I need to work.

43:18.666 --> 43:21.001
Thanks, but I-I really
have stuff to do.

43:21.035 --> 43:23.170
You need to rest, Christine.

43:35.349 --> 43:38.285
But it's just you're
easily taken in at times.

43:38.319 --> 43:40.087
I know.
You think I'm a fool.

43:40.121 --> 43:42.123
Everyone's a fool except Felix.

43:42.156 --> 43:44.125
Me, your clients, everyone.

43:44.158 --> 43:45.726
No, that's -- that's not true.

43:45.759 --> 43:47.361
You're extremely capable.

43:47.394 --> 43:51.232
It's just sometimes
you lose focus.

43:51.265 --> 43:52.833
You can get led astray.

43:52.867 --> 43:55.436
All I know is that I feel
really good right now.

43:55.469 --> 43:57.371
Okay.

43:57.404 --> 44:00.207
Okay, well, that's all
that matters, I suppose.

44:01.809 --> 44:03.010
I give in.

44:44.985 --> 44:47.288
Could we have a little talk?

44:47.321 --> 44:48.455
Come in.

44:53.294 --> 44:54.461
Sit down.

45:06.840 --> 45:11.145
"I get rashes, hair loss,
bad headaches, nerve pain,

45:11.178 --> 45:15.983
and I shake and get dizzy
and absent-minded.

45:16.016 --> 45:18.752
And sometimes
I don't know where I am.

45:18.786 --> 45:21.855
I smell things
that are not there.

45:21.889 --> 45:23.457
My symptoms come and go,

45:23.490 --> 45:26.227
and they vanish
when I visit the doctor.

45:26.260 --> 45:29.063
Sometimes I think
I have lost my mind."

45:31.065 --> 45:33.500
It's easier to have you read it
than for me to say it.

45:35.169 --> 45:36.470
Please.

45:45.112 --> 45:47.781
I-I had an encounter with a dog.

45:48.449 --> 45:50.317
A hideous thing.

45:50.351 --> 45:52.953
I don't know where it came from.

45:52.987 --> 45:56.156
There were ticks, clusters of
them, hanging off the animal.

45:58.158 --> 46:00.261
I have nightmares
about that dog.

46:01.462 --> 46:03.464
It bite you?

46:03.497 --> 46:06.233
No. A tick did.

46:07.134 --> 46:08.502
Then my problems started.

46:10.070 --> 46:12.940
You helped the tremors
and memory.

46:12.973 --> 46:15.142
Would you have cures
to the other problems?

46:16.110 --> 46:18.178
I can help you.

46:18.212 --> 46:19.813
But it's not forever.

46:20.447 --> 46:23.250
Yeah, I-I understand.

46:24.151 --> 46:26.453
And I would of course compensate
you for this extra work.

46:26.487 --> 46:28.455
No.
No, I don't want that.

46:28.489 --> 46:29.591
But it's only right.

46:29.624 --> 46:31.559
No.

46:31.593 --> 46:34.962
But I need you to help me.

46:36.130 --> 46:38.832
-How?
-You trust me.

46:39.400 --> 46:41.135
I do.

46:41.168 --> 46:42.369
At least I think I do.

46:43.605 --> 46:45.306
Don't think you do.

46:46.508 --> 46:48.042
Do.

46:55.983 --> 46:59.386
Something is hidden
inside of you, Christine.

47:00.387 --> 47:02.923
Something you hide
from yourself.

47:05.092 --> 47:09.330
It is invisible to you,
and you must see it.

47:11.633 --> 47:13.467
It makes you sick.

47:15.369 --> 47:19.973
I will draw it out of you
and show it to you.

47:24.111 --> 47:27.081
You must allow me in, Christine.

47:27.114 --> 47:29.917
I will prepare you to face it.

47:29.950 --> 47:32.886
You will know it
when you see it.

47:32.920 --> 47:35.456
You will understand
what must happen.

47:36.357 --> 47:38.158
And you will be free.

48:08.389 --> 48:11.158
Diana was flying last night.

48:11.191 --> 48:12.192
Uh-huh?

48:12.226 --> 48:13.994
I saw her.

48:14.027 --> 48:17.665
She flew off the roof,
up into the clouds.

48:17.699 --> 48:20.100
You must have been dreaming.

48:20.134 --> 48:22.537
Can you dream when you're awake?

48:24.238 --> 48:26.206
Well, obviously some people can.

50:31.098 --> 50:33.568
I like something traditional
in the mornings.

50:37.237 --> 50:39.072
Well, traditional for me,
that is.

50:39.741 --> 50:41.375
I can make traditional.

50:41.408 --> 50:43.377
Uh, no.
Thank you.

50:44.111 --> 50:46.213
-My meds are gone.
-What?

50:51.485 --> 50:53.821
You said you were going to
throw them away, Christine.

50:55.757 --> 50:56.658
Did I?

50:58.392 --> 50:59.794
Jesus.

51:00.795 --> 51:02.830
Another memory loss.

51:03.798 --> 51:05.332
No, you didn't
have a memory loss.

51:05.365 --> 51:07.802
How do you know I didn't
have a memory loss?

51:07.835 --> 51:10.370
I don't even know
when I have memory loss.

51:13.373 --> 51:14.576
It's okay.

51:15.342 --> 51:17.411
You don't need them, hmm?

51:17.444 --> 51:18.646
I hope so.

51:19.681 --> 51:21.381
You trust me, Christine?

51:23.818 --> 51:25.385
Yes.

51:25.419 --> 51:27.387
Yes, I trust you, Diana.

51:33.427 --> 51:35.763
Why didn't Mom bring me?

51:35.797 --> 51:37.765
Your mom is very busy, Roberta.

51:37.799 --> 51:39.601
She's always busy.

52:09.530 --> 52:10.798
Bobs?

52:43.564 --> 52:45.633
Help!

52:48.569 --> 52:50.303
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

52:50.337 --> 52:51.839
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

52:52.907 --> 52:54.241
What is it?

52:57.011 --> 52:58.546
What happened?

52:59.681 --> 53:00.882
Hey, hey.

53:00.915 --> 53:03.851
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

53:08.355 --> 53:10.558
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

53:48.863 --> 53:51.264
Diana, we need to talk.

53:51.298 --> 53:51.933
Now?

53:51.966 --> 53:53.266
Yeah.

53:55.837 --> 54:00.273
Look, I-I know it's
a weird time, but there's --

54:00.307 --> 54:03.376
there's something we should
discuss while we have a chance.

54:07.414 --> 54:11.586
Look, Christine has a lot of...
problems, you know?

54:12.553 --> 54:14.454
Of course.
I'm helping her.

54:14.488 --> 54:18.358
Yeah, but this thing about her
illness and all that, it's...

54:18.391 --> 54:19.660
it's all in her head.

54:21.328 --> 54:22.563
It's buried guilt.

54:23.664 --> 54:25.700
- Guilt?
- Yeah.

54:25.733 --> 54:27.068
She's punishing herself.

54:27.101 --> 54:29.537
Or maybe it's stress
and exhaustion.

54:29.570 --> 54:31.371
I don't know, but...

54:31.404 --> 54:35.042
she's confused and she's in a
very vulnerable place right now.

54:35.076 --> 54:38.946
And I just need you
to stay out of my wife's head.

54:40.581 --> 54:44.351
Diana, you understand
what I'm saying?

54:45.820 --> 54:47.420
I understand.

54:48.355 --> 54:49.422
Good.

54:51.092 --> 54:51.993
Alright.

54:53.995 --> 54:56.798
I understand, but I cannot
stay out of Christine's head.

54:59.000 --> 54:59.967
What?

55:00.001 --> 55:02.904
If her problems are in her head,

55:02.937 --> 55:04.906
I will find them
and chase them out.

55:06.140 --> 55:09.777
Well, then we have a problem,
me and you.

55:10.812 --> 55:13.815
I don't have a problem
with you, Felix.

55:13.848 --> 55:16.551
If you do not
make problems for me.

55:19.020 --> 55:20.521
What is that?
Is that a threat?

55:21.656 --> 55:23.825
No, I think you
have been drinking a lot

55:23.858 --> 55:25.793
and you should not
come into my room.

55:25.827 --> 55:27.762
No, no, no, this is my room.

55:29.797 --> 55:32.867
This -- This is my room.
This is my house.

55:32.900 --> 55:37.370
And I don't like sharing it with
a backwoods snake-oil merchant.

55:38.906 --> 55:40.908
Better to talk in the morning.

55:42.710 --> 55:44.011
Hmm?

55:46.848 --> 55:48.049
Go to sleep.

55:59.093 --> 56:00.728
Be careful on the stairs.

56:27.154 --> 56:29.690
Everyone hates me at school.

56:29.724 --> 56:32.126
Mom's sick.
Daddy's a murderer.

56:32.159 --> 56:36.030
And Big Bird has gone to heaven.
I'm all alone.

56:36.063 --> 56:39.934
Poor Roberta.

56:40.668 --> 56:42.670
Why are you nice to me?

56:42.703 --> 56:44.672
I'm horrible to you.

56:46.073 --> 56:49.143
You are only horrible
because you are angry.

56:49.176 --> 56:50.711
You are scared.

56:50.745 --> 56:52.013
You don't mean it.

56:52.046 --> 56:55.182
I'm sorry I'm rude to you.

56:55.216 --> 56:56.751
You're very nice.

56:56.784 --> 56:58.886
And I do like your food, really.

57:03.724 --> 57:06.527
I want to be your friend,
Roberta.

57:06.560 --> 57:07.628
You will allow me?

57:09.096 --> 57:10.831
Hm?

57:10.865 --> 57:13.134
Then I am your friend, hm?

57:13.167 --> 57:15.202
You will not be alone anymore.

57:15.236 --> 57:18.673
I will be with you always.

57:27.281 --> 57:28.683
Murderer.

58:18.065 --> 58:21.736
What is it?

58:50.698 --> 58:53.334
You are back now, hmm?

58:53.367 --> 58:55.770
-You are here.
-Yes.

58:55.803 --> 58:58.072
-You are strong, hmm?
-Yes.

58:58.105 --> 59:00.207
-You are happy, hmm?
-Yes.

59:16.690 --> 59:19.093
Where's Diana?
Why are you sad, Mom?

59:19.126 --> 59:21.262
I'm not sad, baby.
I'm happy.

59:21.295 --> 59:23.364
I'm so fucking happy.

59:23.397 --> 59:25.666
That's a really bad word.

59:25.699 --> 59:27.701
I don't fucking care.
Mwah!

01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:10.744
Lucky shoes, lucky shoes,
make me win and never lose.

01:00:30.197 --> 01:00:33.701
You know, back at home,
the kids also didn't like me.

01:00:33.734 --> 01:00:35.703
Did not like you?

01:00:35.736 --> 01:00:38.405
Yes, the girls, the boys,
everyone did not like me.

01:00:38.439 --> 01:00:39.673
You know why?

01:00:40.941 --> 01:00:43.410
Because I was not like them.

01:00:43.444 --> 01:00:45.012
But in a good way.

01:00:45.045 --> 01:00:47.181
-You know what, Bobs?
-What?

01:00:47.214 --> 01:00:49.884
I think you are also
not like them.

01:00:49.917 --> 01:00:51.785
But in a good way.

01:00:54.421 --> 01:00:55.789
Maybe.

01:00:57.358 --> 01:00:59.226
What do you learn
in your school?

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:04.431
Some spelling, about the world,
and where everything is.

01:01:07.334 --> 01:01:10.738
Do you want to learn
something else today?

01:01:10.771 --> 01:01:11.839
No school.

01:01:12.473 --> 01:01:13.440
Really?

01:01:13.474 --> 01:01:15.042
Really.

01:01:55.216 --> 01:01:57.218
Smile.

01:03:20.467 --> 01:03:22.836
Okay.
You wowed us.

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:24.438
When you make a comeback,

01:03:24.471 --> 01:03:26.473
you really make a comeback,
don't you?

01:03:27.274 --> 01:03:29.611
We're very keen, Christine,
if you are.

01:03:29.644 --> 01:03:31.412
You know I am.

01:03:31.445 --> 01:03:34.516
We're thinking of launching
with a significant campaign,

01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:38.285
quite amplified, a lot
of coverage -- online, TV.

01:03:38.319 --> 01:03:42.056
With this, I'm thinking
children dancing,

01:03:42.089 --> 01:03:45.426
a little urban, a little ethnic,
Southeast Asian. Pow!

01:03:45.459 --> 01:03:49.129
Get it out there.
Is that okay with you?

01:03:51.332 --> 01:03:52.499
Yeah.

01:04:06.146 --> 01:04:07.448
What are you doing?

01:04:24.498 --> 01:04:26.033
You want to learn?

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:36.910
I am amazing.
I am amazing.

01:04:36.944 --> 01:04:39.179
I am amazing!

01:04:44.017 --> 01:04:45.486
Why did you find them?

01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:48.956
Under her bed.

01:04:51.325 --> 01:04:53.927
What will we tell Mom?

01:04:53.961 --> 01:04:55.429
I will talk to your mom.

01:04:55.462 --> 01:04:57.565
She'll be mad.

01:04:57.599 --> 01:04:59.133
She will not be mad.

01:05:04.606 --> 01:05:07.542
So explain how they got there.

01:05:07.575 --> 01:05:10.344
You should see the creepy voodoo
altar thing up there, as well.

01:05:10.377 --> 01:05:11.412
It's not healthy.

01:05:12.614 --> 01:05:14.381
You do not trust me, Christine.

01:05:14.415 --> 01:05:16.183
You're manipulating me, Diana.

01:05:16.216 --> 01:05:17.284
You do not trust me.

01:05:17.317 --> 01:05:18.952
Why should I fucking trust you?

01:05:18.986 --> 01:05:20.487
What was the idea, Diana?

01:05:20.522 --> 01:05:22.524
She was obviously sneaking
meds into your food,

01:05:22.557 --> 01:05:24.692
making you think it was her
that was helping,

01:05:24.726 --> 01:05:27.562
making you depend on her.

01:05:27.595 --> 01:05:29.263
Need her.
She's controlling you.

01:05:29.296 --> 01:05:31.131
I want to hear it from her.

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:35.670
I'm not the one
who needs to control her.

01:05:37.371 --> 01:05:39.973
Have you any explanation?

01:05:40.007 --> 01:05:42.644
Explaining is useless,
Christine.

01:05:42.677 --> 01:05:43.977
You do not trust me.

01:05:44.011 --> 01:05:45.145
Try me.

01:05:46.614 --> 01:05:48.449
I cannot help you anymore.

01:05:52.219 --> 01:05:54.656
You pitiful wretch.

01:05:58.358 --> 01:06:01.061
Give me your keys.
You have to leave.

01:06:02.730 --> 01:06:04.164
I will pack my things.

01:06:05.132 --> 01:06:06.500
Do that and go.

01:06:32.594 --> 01:06:36.330
We've only just made friends.
Please don't go.

01:06:38.065 --> 01:06:39.266
I have to.

01:06:39.299 --> 01:06:41.068
No.

01:06:41.101 --> 01:06:44.572
But if you want me to come
and be with you forever,

01:06:44.606 --> 01:06:46.473
you can do something for me.

01:06:46.508 --> 01:06:49.109
-Forever?
-Mm-hmm.

01:08:28.175 --> 01:08:30.109
Chrissy.
Christine.

01:08:31.278 --> 01:08:32.846
Jesus. You okay?

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:10.852
You have them all?

01:09:10.885 --> 01:09:12.219
Yeah.

01:09:13.854 --> 01:09:15.389
And you won't forget.

01:09:15.421 --> 01:09:17.224
I won't forget.

01:09:35.475 --> 01:09:36.778
Birds eat worms.

01:09:36.810 --> 01:09:38.746
Now worms eat Big Bird.

01:09:39.446 --> 01:09:41.214
Jesus, Bobs.

01:09:41.247 --> 01:09:43.450
What? It's true.

01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:45.819
Mom?

01:09:46.554 --> 01:09:47.921
What?

01:09:47.955 --> 01:09:50.992
Why did Daddy say Diana
took your tablets?

01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:53.560
Because she did, honey.

01:09:53.594 --> 01:09:54.729
But she didn't, though.

01:09:54.762 --> 01:09:56.531
Why do you say that?

01:09:56.564 --> 01:09:59.199
Well, they were in his car.

01:10:00.535 --> 01:10:01.669
What?

01:10:02.670 --> 01:10:05.338
They were in Daddy's car.
I saw them.

01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:07.842
When did you see them?

01:10:07.875 --> 01:10:09.644
On the way back from school.

01:10:09.677 --> 01:10:12.914
I sat up front and saw them.

01:10:12.947 --> 01:10:16.718
I thought they were new tablets,
but he never gave them to you.

01:10:17.518 --> 01:10:18.786
You didn't say anything?

01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:22.890
I didn't want to find out
that he lets me sit up front.

01:10:25.860 --> 01:10:28.730
Manipulative,
controlling bastard.

01:10:29.530 --> 01:10:31.666
She's not telling the truth.

01:10:31.699 --> 01:10:32.834
Why would she lie?

01:10:33.901 --> 01:10:36.604
Throwing your own kid
under the bus, that's low.

01:10:36.637 --> 01:10:38.940
Not what's happening here,
Christine.

01:10:38.973 --> 01:10:40.307
Then what is happening, Felix?

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:42.409
I don't know.

01:10:42.442 --> 01:10:44.812
We need to talk to Bobs,
find out why she's lying.

01:10:44.846 --> 01:10:46.013
Lying?

01:10:46.047 --> 01:10:48.348
Well, why she's mistaken,
whatever.

01:10:51.318 --> 01:10:52.653
Who are you?

01:10:52.687 --> 01:10:54.522
Who am I?
I'm your husband.

01:10:54.555 --> 01:10:55.857
Chrissy, I'm your best friend.

01:10:55.890 --> 01:10:57.625
I'm looking out for you.
You're not well.

01:10:57.658 --> 01:11:00.061
Not well?
You mean I'm mad?

01:11:00.094 --> 01:11:02.029
No.

01:11:02.063 --> 01:11:03.564
You're just unwell.

01:11:04.599 --> 01:11:06.000
You're unbelievable.

01:11:06.033 --> 01:11:08.468
I'm the only person
you should be believing.

01:11:12.439 --> 01:11:13.875
Look, I'll -- I'll --

01:11:14.976 --> 01:11:17.612
I'll move my stuff upstairs.
I'll give you some space.

01:11:19.379 --> 01:11:20.782
Diana doesn't need
the room anymore.

01:11:20.815 --> 01:11:22.016
You can cool off.

01:11:22.049 --> 01:11:23.551
Cool off?

01:11:23.584 --> 01:11:25.452
You haven't given me
any kind of explanation.

01:11:25.485 --> 01:11:28.455
I'm going to sort this out,
Chrissy, I promise you.

01:11:28.488 --> 01:11:29.824
Sort out a lie, you mean.

01:11:29.857 --> 01:11:32.425
A narrative,
a marketing strategy.

01:11:32.459 --> 01:11:33.528
What, you don't trust me?

01:11:33.561 --> 01:11:34.829
Do you trust me?

01:11:34.862 --> 01:11:36.931
Yes, Christine, I do.

01:11:36.964 --> 01:11:38.800
You trust a crazy woman?

01:12:15.402 --> 01:12:17.437
<i>Be careful of the stairs.</i>

01:12:22.009 --> 01:12:23.678
Wha! Aah!

01:12:43.564 --> 01:12:46.601
Daddy's going to have to go
to hospital for a little while

01:12:46.634 --> 01:12:47.768
until he mends.

01:12:47.802 --> 01:12:50.037
Do we have to go, too?

01:13:16.864 --> 01:13:19.033
There'll be cameras and dancing.

01:13:19.066 --> 01:13:20.500
It'll be fun.

01:13:39.921 --> 01:13:41.522
And action!

01:15:07.608 --> 01:15:08.576
Are you okay?

01:15:17.852 --> 01:15:19.553
Are you okay?

01:15:40.674 --> 01:15:42.009
It's okay.

01:15:45.913 --> 01:15:47.248
It's okay.

01:16:09.637 --> 01:16:10.671
Mom.

01:16:14.308 --> 01:16:17.311
Mommy, are you sick?

01:16:20.681 --> 01:16:22.016
Go away.

01:16:24.251 --> 01:16:26.120
Please go away.

01:17:06.994 --> 01:17:08.829
Don't cry, Christine.

01:17:08.863 --> 01:17:10.764
I am here now.

01:17:11.832 --> 01:17:13.901
We will finish what we started.

01:18:39.453 --> 01:18:42.156
You are ready now, Christine.

01:18:42.189 --> 01:18:45.826
It is time for you
to face what is within you.

01:18:45.859 --> 01:18:47.428
What torments you.

01:18:48.563 --> 01:18:50.898
It is time for you to see

01:18:50.931 --> 01:18:54.768
and it is time
for you to understand.

01:19:15.089 --> 01:19:20.094
Lucky shoes, lucky shoes,
make me win and never lose.

01:19:53.294 --> 01:19:55.863
The girls are doing 25 T-shirts
an hour, right?

01:19:55.896 --> 01:19:56.930
Yes, ma'am.

01:19:58.265 --> 01:20:00.200
Perhaps they can do 30.

01:20:00.234 --> 01:20:02.403
Yes, ma'am,
but the quality will suffer.

01:20:02.436 --> 01:20:05.239
Well, where there's a will,
there's a way.

01:20:05.906 --> 01:20:06.940
Yes, ma'am.

01:20:10.044 --> 01:20:11.445
The door on the way in,

01:20:11.478 --> 01:20:14.181
it seems the employees
are free to come and go.

01:20:14.214 --> 01:20:16.551
But for the sake of accounting
for all the items --

01:20:16.584 --> 01:20:19.286
I wouldn't like anything
to go astray --

01:20:19.320 --> 01:20:21.589
maybe the door could be locked

01:20:21.623 --> 01:20:23.457
so you can make sure
no items go missing

01:20:23.490 --> 01:20:25.859
when the employees leave.

01:20:25.893 --> 01:20:27.127
Yes, of course, ma'am.

01:20:31.633 --> 01:20:32.866
And who are you?

01:20:36.003 --> 01:20:38.172
Come.
I'm not gonna bite you.

01:20:40.908 --> 01:20:42.976
You're adorable.

01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:44.178
Will you let me take a picture?

01:20:44.646 --> 01:20:46.146
Would you, Juan?

01:20:56.558 --> 01:20:58.392
Exemplary work.

01:21:04.666 --> 01:21:08.402
Magic will bring people
to your party.

01:21:08.435 --> 01:21:11.004
You won't be all alone.

01:21:14.942 --> 01:21:17.010
Double shift today.

01:21:17.044 --> 01:21:18.445
What?

01:21:20.114 --> 01:21:21.215
Double shift.

01:21:22.216 --> 01:21:24.017
How soon will I be cured?

01:21:26.487 --> 01:21:30.190
Oh, no, we are not curing
anymore, Christine.

01:21:30.224 --> 01:21:32.226
This is so much better
than a cure.

01:21:34.128 --> 01:21:35.295
Oh.

01:22:45.567 --> 01:22:47.000
After shift.

01:22:48.736 --> 01:22:50.237
But it's so hot.

01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:52.172
Finish your work.

01:25:23.725 --> 01:25:25.292
What do you see?

01:25:26.861 --> 01:25:28.596
She covers her eyes.

01:25:31.498 --> 01:25:33.835
She doesn't want
to see them burn.

01:25:36.403 --> 01:25:38.573
She's so scared.

01:25:38.606 --> 01:25:40.173
So scared.

01:27:04.826 --> 01:27:08.261
I had a child, Christine.

01:27:08.295 --> 01:27:10.698
A girl like Bobs.

01:27:11.566 --> 01:27:15.402
She was beautiful,
and she was so good.

01:27:15.435 --> 01:27:17.337
But then you come.

01:27:17.370 --> 01:27:19.272
You create the parasite.

01:27:19.306 --> 01:27:20.975
You're a tick, Christine.

01:27:21.008 --> 01:27:25.046
Feeding, sucking
everything from us.

01:27:25.079 --> 01:27:27.949
You took my daughter
away from me, Christine.

01:27:29.717 --> 01:27:31.652
I will take your daughter
away from you.

01:27:31.686 --> 01:27:33.353
Please don't.

01:27:34.522 --> 01:27:36.490
I'm sorry.

01:27:36.524 --> 01:27:37.992
Forgive me.

01:27:40.795 --> 01:27:43.798
You are free now, Christine.

01:27:43.831 --> 01:27:46.299
I have brought you what you need
but hide from,

01:27:46.333 --> 01:27:48.603
what makes you sick.

01:27:48.636 --> 01:27:50.872
You will face your own judgment.

01:28:49.764 --> 01:28:51.364
Goodbye, Bobs.

01:28:51.398 --> 01:28:54.467
You said you'd be
with me forever.

01:28:54.501 --> 01:28:56.737
You promised.

01:28:56.771 --> 01:28:58.906
I will keep my promise.

01:28:59.941 --> 01:29:01.008
Go to the garden.

01:29:02.043 --> 01:29:03.376
Look up.

01:29:26.499 --> 01:29:27.768
Diana!

01:29:56.163 --> 01:29:57.865
Christine?

01:30:07.608 --> 01:30:08.809
Christine?
