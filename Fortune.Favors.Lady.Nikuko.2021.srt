00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,620
{\an8}YUMMY MEAT

2
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:39,470
Nikuko is my mom.

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,470
Drink up, fellas!

4
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,600
What's your height, Nikuko?

5
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,470
Hey, don't ask a lady
questions like that!

6
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,930
She's 151 cm tall.
67.4 kg light.

7
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,930
In number puns,
that's "No work, no fun."

8
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,220
March 4th? That's "Sounds swell."

9
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,850
8812?

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,220
"Gimme a leaf."
Right?

11
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,800
She loves number puns.

12
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:08,930
When you "MINGLE" with a "BEAST"
you get "SLY."

13
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:14,680
When "YOU" get too "BIG"
you get "STINKY."

14
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,640
She loves kanji puns even more.

15
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:24,720
Nikuko grew up in a small town,
and made the big move to Osaka at age 16.

16
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,260
She started working at a bar.

17
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:33,180
That's where she met
The Casino Dealer.

18
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:34,850
What a classy guy!

19
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,140
But when he screwed up at work,

20
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:42,140
he skipped town, leaving Nikuko
to deal with his "huge" debt.

21
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:48,050
She worked herself to the bone,
but she paid the debt off.

22
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:51,470
Then she moved to Nagoya.

23
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,850
She was 27 years old,
and all worn out.

24
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:59,510
That's where she met
The Barman.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,010
He was working his way through college.

26
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,680
That sounds tough.

27
00:02:04,010 --> 00:02:06,140
Of course, he was no student.

28
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:08,260
But Nikuko fell for it.

29
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,930
He went through her money
like water.

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:14,720
She only caught him cheating
during his eighth affair.

31
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:19,510
Leaving everything behind,
Nikuko headed for Yokohama.

32
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,510
She was 30 years old,
and all worn out.

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,140
That's where she met
The Married Office Worker.

34
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:29,510
He parts his hair?
What a stand-up guy!

35
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:33,050
Of course, he started
borrowing money from Nikuko.

36
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,720
It was for his divorce.

37
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,760
Love you!

38
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:39,220
At first, he needed 500,000 yen.
Then he needed more.

39
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,390
When it reached three million,

40
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,430
Nikuko learned his wife was
pregnant again.

41
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,510
Furious, she raced to his house.

42
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:53,260
But when she saw the kid's bike,

43
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,550
she walked away from it all.

44
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:58,930
The kid hasn't done anything wrong.

45
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,010
Nikuko has the sweetest of hearts.

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,220
Then she headed to Tokyo.

47
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:10,140
She was 33 years old,
and all worn out.

48
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,680
She started working at a deli.
No more bars for her.

49
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,850
She wanted to steer clear of shady men.

50
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,300
But then she met
The Novelist.

51
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,930
He looks troubled!

52
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,640
It turned out this guy really was
an aspiring novelist.

53
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,390
But he never wrote a line.

54
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:35,140
All he did was buy books
with Nikuko's money.

55
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,100
But unlike the other guys,
he never fooled around with other women.

56
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:45,100
Nikuko cared a great deal for
The Novelist.

57
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,100
And I didn't hate him
as much as the others.

58
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,550
What I liked most was
the books he bought.

59
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,300
My life was pretty miserable,

60
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:01,640
but they provided
a faint source of light.

61
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,680
For the first time ever,

62
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,010
I started to paint
a vague picture of the future.

63
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:11,510
I thought the three of us might
live here together forever.

64
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:17,300
- But one day, he suddenly disappeared.
- I'M GOING HOME TO DIE

65
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,800
Nikuko panicked.

66
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:27,010
We leapt on a northbound train,
hoping that's where he lived.

67
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:32,550
"MYSELF," "HEART" and "CHICKEN."
That's how you write "WORRY."

68
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,390
She ate four meals on the train.

69
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,680
Four whole meals!

70
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,140
Then we arrived in some port town.

71
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,890
It was snowing.

72
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,930
She was a giant matryoshka
looking for a lost man,

73
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,390
dragging around an eight-year-old girl
in the middle of a blizzard.

74
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,300
The rumors spread quickly.

75
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,140
It was such a small town.

76
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:07,100
She never found him.

77
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,720
When "RAIN" needs a "BROOM"
you have "SNOW."

78
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,050
She was 35 years old,
and all worn out.

79
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:32,430
She decided to live here.

80
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:37,930
That's the story of "The Meaty Lady,"
my mom Nikuko.

81
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,680

What's that?

87
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,510
Gee whiz.

88
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:19,640
Go beyond!

89
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,550
Morning!

90
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,680
What's the time? Morning?!
Kikurin!

91
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,720
Wake up! Kikurin!

92
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,680
You gotta eat school
and go to breakfast!

93
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,390
Huh?
You gotta eat school...

94
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,220
And go to breakfast...

95
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,890
Hm?
Something's not right.

96
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,220
You gotta eat breakfast,
and go to school,

97
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,550
- then eat some more.
- Nikuko.

98
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,760
Morning.

99
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,640
Morning, Kikurin.

100
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,720
That's actually a sad song.

101
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:06,510
It's ready!

102
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,470
Bless this food!

103
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,890
- That was yum.
- Finished already?

104
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,890
- I eat meals like that for breakfast!
- That was breakfast!

105
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:36,930
- Isn't that the saying?
- Oh, I nearly forgot.

106
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:40,140
- Eat breakfast for breakfast...
- Sign this for me.

107
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:41,760
Sign it? Why?

108
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,350
It's for my swimming lessons.
We need parental permission.

109
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,010
Okey doke!
I eat permission slips for breakfast!

110
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,220
Even when I'm full.

111
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,510
Not there, Nikuko!

112
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,800
What?

113
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:02,390
That's where my name goes!

114
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,220
Student Name, Misuji Kikuko

115
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,010
Oh no. I screwed up.

116
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,510
I'll have to write your name
where it says "Parent."

117
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,260
Then I'll add some arrows like this.

118
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,350
We use different kanji, but we're
both called "Kikuko." What a mess.

119
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:30,800
Go get 'em, honey.

120
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,720
See you later.

121
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,510
{\an8}MISUJI KIKUKO KIKUKO
(aka KIKURIN) (aka NIKUKO)

122
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,260
Our family name looks like a girl's name.
It's like three women live here.

123
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,430
Hey, cut it out!

124
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:04,050
Maria!

125
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,550
Kikurin! Morning!

126
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,760
Hi. Did you wait long?

127
00:11:08,890 --> 00:11:11,010
Nope! Let's go, Kikurin!

128
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,680
Don't run on our bridge!

129
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,050
- Nakajima.
- Here.

130
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:28,350
Nogami.

131
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,800
Manaka.

132
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,180
Misuji.

133
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,180
Misuji...

134
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,890
MISUJI

135
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,510
This is misuji.

136
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,930
It's the tastiest part of
the oyster blade.

137
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,760
- Yummy!
- Yummy!

138
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,300
The Misujis are eating misuji!

139
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:13,050
Old Sassan's misuji is so darn tasty...

140
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,260
Stop it!

141
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,140
Why am I daydreaming about
"The Meaty Lady"?

142
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,550
- Everything's a mess.
- PERMISSION TO SWIM I'M THE MOM!

143
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,140
It's too much!

144
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,100
Sassan!

145
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:08,390
Nikuko! See you at the grill later.

146
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,470
You betcha!

147
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,120
{\an8}UWOGASHI GRILL HOUSE

{\an8}YUMMY MEAT

149
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:00,100
Rock paper scissors!
Ready, go!

150
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:01,720
Kikurin.

151
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:05,680
- Yosshi.
- Hozumi.

152
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:08,390
- Akechi.
- Risa.

153
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,600
- Sayaka.
- Nakaji.

154
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:14,350
Hmm.... Maria.

155
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:19,720
Hear that pause before she chose Maria?

156
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:26,300
The girls in my class play basketball
during our lunch break.

157
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:34,350
Even the girls who don't play watch,
cheering along on the sidelines.

158
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:36,680
I think nobody does their own thing

159
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,260
because they don't want to be
left out of the circle.

160
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:49,390
Come on.
Time to go back.

161
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,390
What a goody-goody.

162
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:56,600
I'm definitely right!

163
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:57,930
I'm not so sure.

164
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,720
I am!
There's no doubt about it!

165
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:04,350
Kikurin! You know it's true.

166
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,050
Like I said. I don't.

167
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,100
Come on! Don’t lie!

168
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,220
- Kanemoto definitely likes you!
- What do you mean?

169
00:15:11,350 --> 00:15:15,260
That's why she always picks you first!

170
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,010
- But they do rock paper scissors.
- Yeah! That's wrong too.

171
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:21,140
It's totally unfair!

172
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,510
You want to play on Mori's team, right?

173
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:28,050
Well, I don't care which team,
as long as I get to play.

174
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:35,470
Either way, ever since you
transferred here, I've been...

175
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,510
Dammit.
It's those dumb boys again.

176
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,600
They're here every day.
I bet they're sweet on you.

177
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:48,050
Ew!
That's gross!

178
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:50,720
Way too gross!

179
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,550
See you, Maria.

180
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,510
Hey!
Leave us alone!

181
00:15:56,470 --> 00:15:58,220
Kikurin! Bye bye!

182
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,300
{\an8}MIZUKAWA SHRINE

183
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:10,050
Excuse me, young lady.
I am absolutely full of history.

184
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,350
Would you fancy some details?

185
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,260
"The Sexy Shrine" talks too much.

186
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,890
I have no idea why it's called that.

187
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,800
I could smell summer in the sea air.

188
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:02,800
- Want some more meat?
- Two plates of loin, please.

189
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:05,140
- Loin, two plates!
- Loin!

190
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,510
Here's your second round of rice, boys.

191
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:14,050
You sure know how to eat.

192
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,850
- More, please!
- Wow!

193
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,430
Kikurin!

194
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,220
Hi... everyone.

195
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,800
Hi there!

196
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,390
Kikurin! Over here!
This table's free!

197
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:42,680
- Loin's ready!
- Right up!

198
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,930
Meat, meat, meat!

199
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,010
Here's the loin meat
you couldn't wait for!

200
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:51,680
The All-Seeing Dalicia's
Special Psychic Show!

201
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:55,850
- Welcome to the show...
- Hey, Kiku.

202
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,850
Tonight's staff special.

203
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,180
Fried noodles with meat!
Thank you!

204
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,850
- Like it, Kiku?
- It's great!

205
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,800
Will I see, or not?

206
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,510
I see all!

207
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,430
- You did wrong in a past life!
- I did?

208
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:37,550
You killed sacred white snakes.

209
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,010
- I don't recall that...
- What a sucker!

210
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:42,390
Of course not.
It was your past life!

211
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:44,430
What will happen now I'm cursed?

212
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:47,140
- Your forehead will fester!
- She's too much.

213
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,640
You have such a round forehead.

214
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,720
It's going to fester.

215
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:54,930
How can I stop the festering?

216
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,010
- Sushi.
- Sushi?

217
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,720
Kikurin.

218
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:02,510
That foreign fortune teller is on TV
so much these days.

219
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,140
You're right.
She's on all the time.

220
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:08,390
Her name's Dalicia.
She's always right.

221
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:10,510
She says the craziest things.

222
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:14,510
Before you got here she drew
a picture of some guy's dead father.

223
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,550
It took a few days,
so they had to edit it,

224
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:20,430
but when she finished,
it looked just like him!

225
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:22,600
- It was a collage!
- Why?

226
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,300
It was exactly like him.

227
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:27,430
No way. A collage? Days later?
That sounds shady.

228
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:30,430
- I bet she sees everything.
- I bet she doesn't.

229
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:33,180
What have you been reading lately?

230
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:35,140
Salinger.

231
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,220
Salinger?
That sounds like a superhero ranger.

232
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,680
I bet the print's small.

233
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:41,510
You're so smart.

234
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,430
Kikurin, you're so smart!

235
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,760
She's smart and cute!

236
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,510
Thanks a bunch.

237
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,600
- Way to go, Nikuko!
- It's "Kikuko," actually.

238
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,350
- Nikuko!
- Coming!

239
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:57,510
- Can I get you more meat?
- Your fates are sealed!

240
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,390
In your past lives!

241
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,760
Past lives...

242
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,180
If we really do have past lives,
I wonder what Nikuko's was like.

243
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,140
She has such a hard life now.

244
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,180
Did she do something that bad?

245
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,470
Good night!

246
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:41,910
{\an8}THIS IS THE LAST ROLL!

247
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:46,890
Nikuko is bad at starting things off.

248
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,140
It's all stuck together.
I don't know which way to peel!

249
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,890
Try sticking tape onto it?

250
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,260
Her problem isn't just with objects.

251
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,260
She's bad at starting relationships too.

252
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,140
She doesn't know what she needs,
let alone the needs of others.

253
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,140
{\an8}PROBLEM CHILD

254
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:14,180
People get annoyed with her,
make fun of her, or they deceive her.

255
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:18,640
Wherever she goes, she's 100% Nikuko.

256
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,640
I'd like to ask Dalicia.

257
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:28,350
If she really can see all,
what did Nikuko do in her past life?

258
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:34,100
And I also want to ask
what kind of life awaits us.

259
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,010
Some girls in my class
got their periods.

260
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,470
Some wear bras too.

261
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,100
My body's the same as it's always been.

262
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:57,600
I'm scrawny, my chest is flat,
and my legs look like twigs.

263
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,890
Still, I like my body.

264
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:06,850
I hope my chest never grows,
and my period never starts.

265
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,140
THREE FOR 150 YEN
THREE FOR 180 YEN

266
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,140
This would drive Nikuko wild.

267
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,430
No way!
She'd get even meatier.

268
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,800
Hey!
What color are your shoes?

269
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,180
Black.

270
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,850
Thought so!

271
00:22:39,930 --> 00:22:41,930
Damn, that's scary!

272
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:12,680
From then on, I observed him
whenever I could.

273
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,760
But he never made any weird faces
while I was watching.

274
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,510
Huh?
The kid at the back?

275
00:23:23,390 --> 00:23:26,010
The two laughing are
Matsumoto and Sakurai.

276
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,430
Behind them is Ninomiya.

277
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,470
Did he do something?

278
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:33,100
No, I was just wondering...

279
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:35,100
Oh? You're sweet on him?

280
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,850
Of course not.
I remember now.

281
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,600
Matsumoto, Sakurai,
and Ninomiya, right?

282
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,390
This was a first.

283
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,430
I'm not "sweet on him"
like Maria said,

284
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,300
but I think I'll keep an eye
on Ninomiya for a while.

285
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,010
Rock paper scissors!

286
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,760
- Kikurin.
- Yosshi.

287
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:57,010
- Hozumi.
- Akechi.

288
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:59,350
- Risa.
- Sayaka.

289
00:23:59,510 --> 00:24:01,350
- Nakaji.
- Maria.

290
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,550
What's Maria's problem?

291
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,510
- Bye, Kikurin!
- Bye bye!

292
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,510
Dammit!

293
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,890
I'm a mess.

294
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:07,140
If I didn't know Nikuko,
I'd think it's a crime scene.

295
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,100
Uwogashi is closed today.
It's Nikuko's day off.

296
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,010
She probably sorted through the laundry,
hand-washed my gym clothes,

297
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:22,800
then started to prepare lunch,
but halfway through,

298
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:25,300
sleep got the better of her.

299
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,790
{\an8}RICH AND MEATY

300
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:12,890
Nikuko.

301
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,720
Food's ready.

302
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,180
Wow! Meat spag?

303
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,720
I missed you!

304
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:24,430
Are you talking to me,
or the meat spag?

305
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,430
Bless this food!

306
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,220
I love your meat spag, Kikurin!

307
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:36,550
It's not me.
It's the can.

308
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,220
Then I love your can, Kikurin!

309
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,760
You're nuts.

310
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,850
What are we gonna do today?

311
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,890
What can we do?
It's pouring.

312
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,680
Who cares?

313
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,220
When else do we get the chance
to hang out?

314
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,800
What's wrong?
Got stuff to do?

315
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,890
Not really, but...

316
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,430
Perfect!

317
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,300
Wanna go see Penta?

318
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,890
- Why not?
- That penguin makes me sad.

319
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:05,890
And it's "Kanko," not "Penta."

320
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,930
How come?!
Penta is super cute.

321
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,550
Nikuko adores that penguin.

322
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,050
Even though she gets its name wrong.

323
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,930
Alright, let's go.

324
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,720
Yippee!

325
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,550
Penta, Penta, Penta!

326
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,470
Penta, Penta, Penta!

327
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,010
{\an8}SEXY MIZUKAWA SHRINE

328
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,430
Why are those monks pink?

329
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:47,250
{\an8}SEXY MIZUKAWA SHRINE

330
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:47,220
You won't bump into any classmates.
There's no chance.

331
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,720
Kikurin, you say something?

332
00:27:51,850 --> 00:27:52,890
Nope.

333
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,470
Everyone in town knows Nikuko.

334
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,800
"The cheery plump lady
who wound up living here."

335
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,470
She stands out in this little place.

336
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,850
What's more, she's my mom.

337
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,600
Such wonderful history, young lady.

338
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,260
Kikurin, you say something?

339
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:18,680
Nope.

340
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,890
I was relieved when the bus came.

341
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:30,220
Part of me had been wishing,

342
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:34,390
"I hope nobody from school sees me."

343
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,350
The next stop is Noda Housing Complex.

344
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,790
{\an8}NODA HOUSING COMPLEX

345
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:58,300
Please be seated.

346
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,760
The next stop is The Aquarium.

347
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,790
{\an8}THE AQUARIUM

348
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:40,720
Did Ninomiya really not notice me?

349
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,600
The rain stopped.

350
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,290
- "SUN" and "BLUE" make "SUNNY"

351
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:52,290
{\an8}NEXT STOP: KOTOBUKI CENTER

352
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,510
- Hey Nikuko.
- What?

353
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,510
What's this "Kotobuki Center"?

354
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,930
Kotobu...?

355
00:29:58,510 --> 00:30:00,260
Some kinda center, right?

356
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,010
Forget I asked.

357
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,470
One adult, one child.

358
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,010
Come on in.

359
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,930
You're a cutie.

360
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,390
Thanks.

361
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:15,010
The whole place is yours today.

362
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,350
Yippee!

363
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,640
Yay, yay, yay!

364
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,010
Yay, yay, yay!

365
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:23,140
Which of us is the child?

366
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,080
{\an8}KANKO

367
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,640
Death to you all!

368
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,220
Penta!

369
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,260
He's so cute!

370
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,640
Death to you all!

371
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,300
Hey, want to come over?

372
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,050
- Today?
- Yeah.

373
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,300
- Yeah, sure.
- Yippee!

374
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:22,510
I'm so glad you're coming!

375
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:27,550
I invited Mori, Yosshi, Sayaka,
and Akechi today too.

376
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,930
What's wrong?

377
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,640
No, nothing's wrong.

378
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,050
You're so weird!

379
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:38,720
That's Mori's dream team.

380
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,470
That's life.

381
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,510
I don't wanna go.

382
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:00,890
I speak with Nikuko's accent when
I think out loud. What's with that?

383
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,510
Welcome back, Kikurin.

384
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,430
Look what I found.

385
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,100
Three for just 130 yen!

386
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:16,760
How cheap!
Yoshitoku makes great discounts.

387
00:32:16,890 --> 00:32:18,930
They sure do, at Yoshitoku.

388
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,720
Kikurin, how was your day?

389
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,720
Ordinary.

390
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,010
Ordinary?
Ordinary is the best of all.

391
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,760
Come for dinner around 7.

392
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:42,050
I might go to Maria's.

393
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:45,430
Oh yeah?
You'll have dinner there?

394
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,140
But I might not go.

395
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,390
You won't?

396
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,140
Well, I dunno.

397
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,720
She invited you?

398
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,350
Don't wanna go?

399
00:32:56,470 --> 00:32:59,260
It's not that I don't want to.
It's just...

400
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,300
If I go, I'll have to listen to Maria
badmouth Kanemoto.

401
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:09,890
Then she'll say I should
join Mori's basketball team...

402
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,640
I won't be able to say no.

403
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,220
Don't go then.

404
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:23,640
Say you caught a cold or something.

405
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,510
I'll do that.

406
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,260
If I feel bad, you'll call her for me?

407
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:38,760
No, it's cool.

408
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,390
I called her straight away.

409
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,720
Sorry Maria.

410
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:48,050
Don't be. I hope you're okay.
Get some sleep.

411
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,720
I will. Thanks.

412
00:33:53,550 --> 00:33:57,010
I felt bad about making Maria worry,

413
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,800
but it was a weight off my shoulders.

414
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:08,510
Kikurin.

415
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,010
Got a second?

416
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:16,760
Kikurin, I'd like to ask you something.

417
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,100
What is it?

418
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,100
What do you think about Kanemoto?

419
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,300
What do I think?

420
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:26,760
It seems like
they made a decision yesterday.

421
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,180
How am I going to handle this?

422
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,890
She's good at sports.
I envy her for that.

423
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:37,220
That's not what I mean!

424
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,300
Do you like Kanemoto?

425
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:41,680
Like her?

426
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:43,100
Isn't she bossy?

427
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,600
Come to think of it,

428
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:52,140
I've never really talked to
the other girls before.

429
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,680
It was Kanemoto's idea to choose teams
when we play basketball.

430
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,760
- It was?
- It was!

431
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:02,930
And she only ever picks her favorites.

432
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:06,800
The others get left out.
Don't you feel bad for them?

433
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,800
Mori doesn't want to choose.

434
00:35:09,930 --> 00:35:13,550
But she has to,
because Kanemoto forces her.

435
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,050
She does?

436
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:17,220
You wouldn't notice.

437
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:20,390
Because you're Kanemoto's favorite.

438
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,640
Next lunch break,
when she asks us to play,

439
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,850
we’re going to turn her down.

440
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:29,640
So Kikurin,
play with us instead!

441
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,680
But I...

442
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,800
Are you betraying me?

443
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:37,550
No, I just...

444
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:40,140
Then play basketball with us!

445
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,550
If we do it Kanemoto's way,
people will always be left out.

446
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:48,140
Kikurin!

447
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,430
Please!

448
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,050
I just...

449
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,890
Forget about it.
Let's go, Maria.

450
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,430
Fine.

451
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,350
Who wants to play with us?

452
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,390
Those who never get picked
can play too!

453
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:27,010
Uh-oh.
It's a chick fight!

454
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,640
So, who's coming?
Let's play.

455
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,850
Let's go!

456
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:49,760
Kanemoto didn't even flinch
under Maria's pressure.

457
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,300
She played with those who stayed.

458
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:55,100
I can't choose.

459
00:36:55,640 --> 00:37:01,510
It's not right to leave people out,
but is what Maria's doing right?

460
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,680
I can't say it's wrong.

461
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:09,010
Even if I had a solid opinion,
I couldn't share it.

462
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,260
I just want to accept theirs,
and run away.

463
00:37:21,930 --> 00:37:27,350
When I transferred here,
Maria was the first to talk to me.

464
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:32,760
She was kind, looked out for me,
and genuinely liked me.

465
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:38,050
I doubt she'll ever
walk home with me again.

466
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,540
{\an8}SEXY MIZUKAWA SHRINE

467
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,510
I'm late! I'm late!

468
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,720
For a date I don't even have!

469
00:37:52,890 --> 00:37:55,260
The world is a hazy white.

470
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,720
I spent seven years buried,
just to die aboveground!

471
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,720
Fried noodles!

472
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:18,260
Beef kebabs!
Frankfurters!

473
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,550
Kikurin!

474
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:26,010
What?
No summer kimono?

475
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,510
I couldn't be bothered.

476
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:32,100
What a waste!
You'd look great in one.

477
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,550
How true. You would.
You are so cute!

478
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:38,180
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah right!

479
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,010
Come on.

480
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:47,510
Come try your luck!

481
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:57,220
Come get it!

482
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,350
They both smell great.

483
00:39:05,510 --> 00:39:06,720
There's Maria.

484
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,600
All by herself.

485
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,300
Isn't that her mom?

486
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:14,600
- Maria's so tacky.
- She's lame.

487
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:20,640
Maria ended up being
kicked out of Mori's group too.

488
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:26,260
She was probably too selfish,
and pushed too hard.

489
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,470
I wondered what I should do,

490
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,260
but I couldn't do anything.

491
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,390
I still had mixed feelings for her...

492
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:37,720
I'm coming!

493
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,350
Oh, Kikurin!

494
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,930
Hey!

495
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,180
Having fun?

496
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:49,260
Are you?

497
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:52,760
That's your mom, right?

498
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,010
Yeah.

499
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:56,550
- She keeps herself young.
- True.

500
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,720
You think so?

501
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:59,680
What an idiot!

502
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,260
- But you look nothing alike.
- True.

503
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:05,260
- You think so?
- Yeah. Nothing alike at all.

504
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,180
When Nikuko's drunk, she squints her eyes
and gets droopy eyelids.

505
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,850
Okay, let's see how
your okonomiyaki tastes.

506
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,760
What pressure!

507
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,470
If I don't like it,
I'm getting a refund.

508
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,510
She starts to slur her words too.

509
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,720
Oh no.
He's just her type.

510
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:29,350
This is how she always falls
for the dirtbags.

511
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,510
Does the summer heat make her
a pushover?

512
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,720
Nope.

513
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,350
She's a pushover all year around!

514
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:40,510
Misuji?

515
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:42,680
Ninomiya...

516
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,510
That's better.

517
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:52,800
I waited all that time,
just for this?

518
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,050
The new term started.

519
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:15,470
Mori's and Kanemoto's groups
went back to normal.

520
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:18,510
Only one student was left out.

521
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,510
It was Maria.

522
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,510
Ninomiya...

523
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,100
Misuji.

524
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:55,800
You know my name?

525
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:57,350
Yeah.

526
00:41:57,470 --> 00:42:00,100
- What are you doing?
- Looking at this.

527
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:05,510
- You?
- I went shopping at Yoshitoku.

528
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:07,100
Oh.

529
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,800
"Batou Kannon"?

530
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:12,550
The Guardian of Horses.

531
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,800
- Why were you looking at it?
- Well...

532
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,390
It used to be closer to the beach.

533
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:22,350
The beach?

534
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,470
There was a tsunami,
ages ago.

535
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:31,680
Wow, right?

536
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:34,550
- How do you know that?
- I looked it up.

537
00:42:40,510 --> 00:42:43,350
- I saw you on the bus before.
- Yeah, I know.

538
00:42:44,430 --> 00:42:46,010
He knew?!

539
00:42:47,510 --> 00:42:49,470
You went to the aquarium.

540
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:52,550
- Was that your mom?
- Yeah.

541
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:55,850
You look nothing alike.

542
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,720
You look nothing alike.
Not one bit.

543
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:05,350
Where did you go that day?

544
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,050
Kotobuki Center.

545
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:10,010
- What's that?
- Beats me.

546
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,350
- What do you do there?
- I'm making a model.

547
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,930
- A model?
- Yeah.

548
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,550
- Why?
- My parents make me.

549
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,760
- They make you make a model?
- Yeah.

550
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:21,260
Why?

551
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,510
They say I need to
focus on something.

552
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:27,350
- What kind of model?
- Not telling.

553
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:30,140
It's a model of the thing
I care about most.

554
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:32,430
Why do you need to focus?

555
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,640
You know how I pull those faces?

556
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,890
Yeah, I noticed.
Like when you stick your lips out.

557
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,140
Yeah.

558
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,430
I can't stop doing that.

559
00:43:51,350 --> 00:43:53,800
So, today's the day I go to the center.

560
00:43:53,930 --> 00:43:55,430
Will you make your model?

561
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:57,470
Yeah.

562
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,100
Join me?

563
00:44:03,470 --> 00:44:04,550
Just kidding.

564
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,550
- Are you going to walk?
- I have things to look at on the way.

565
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,930
Go beyond!

566
00:44:30,890 --> 00:44:33,850
- When did you start doing it?
- I don't know.

567
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:35,550
I just did it.

568
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,100
I see.

569
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:41,550
I thought everybody did it.

570
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,890
I thought pulling faces was normal.

571
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,680
But that wasn't the case.

572
00:44:46,010 --> 00:44:48,180
I think I know how it feels.

573
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:51,600
The truth is,
I've been imitating Ninomiya.

574
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,050
It feels great when you make a face.

575
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:00,760
It's more like
something I have to do.

576
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,430
I'll show you my secret place.

577
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:10,300
This way.

578
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,600
Your secret place?

579
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:26,010
Where exactly are we?

580
00:45:46,930 --> 00:45:50,260
Everybody lives down there.
Isn't it amazing?

581
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:55,300
Everything looks like a toy.

582
00:45:56,930 --> 00:45:58,930
You can see your home.

583
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,510
You know where I live?

584
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:07,100
Do those two know this place too?

585
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,430
Those two?
Oh, Matsumoto and Sakurai?

586
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:11,930
- Yeah.
- Nope.

587
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:15,140
This place is for me only.

588
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:17,720
Is that so?

589
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,300
Go beyond!

590
00:46:20,430 --> 00:46:22,410
{\an8}KOTOBUKI CENTER

591
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:27,890
Will they let me in?

592
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:29,300
It's cool.

593
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:42,140
Welcome to Kotobuki Center.
Please tap in with your card.

594
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:44,800
What is this? A robot?!

595
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,600
One moment, please.

596
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,600
Why does the robot sound just like
the aquarium guy?!

597
00:46:51,390 --> 00:46:54,300
- Hello Ninomiya.
- Hi.

598
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,600
Is this a friend of yours?

599
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:59,220
- Hello.
- Hello.

600
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,890
You can wait in the classroom.

601
00:47:20,140 --> 00:47:23,180
I could tell Ninomiya was showing off.

602
00:47:24,390 --> 00:47:27,350
He'd been waiting to
show someone this place.

603
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,800
I'd want to show off too.

604
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:36,140
Are you close with
Matsumoto and Sakurai?

605
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:39,300
We've been in the same class
since Grade 2.

606
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,300
They're just always there.

607
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:44,050
Do they know you come here?

608
00:47:44,180 --> 00:47:45,300
They do.

609
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:46,510
They do?!

610
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,510
So this isn't a secret?!

611
00:47:53,550 --> 00:47:57,550
Things are screwed up
with the girls in my class.

612
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,640
How?

613
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:02,470
You know Maria?
She wears frilly clothes.

614
00:48:04,010 --> 00:48:05,470
She's cute.

615
00:48:06,510 --> 00:48:07,510
Seriously?!

616
00:48:10,510 --> 00:48:14,680
She dresses like a princess,
and she's feminine.

617
00:48:15,010 --> 00:48:19,350
It doesn't suit her!
She has no idea how she looks.

618
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:23,760
She doesn't even realize the other girls
diss her for those clothes.

619
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:26,890
They diss her? Poor thing.

620
00:48:27,550 --> 00:48:29,850
She's the one who started it!

621
00:48:30,260 --> 00:48:31,300
She did?

622
00:48:31,430 --> 00:48:34,720
Maria wanted to be
the center of attention.

623
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,800
That's why she tried to divide
Mori and Kanemoto.

624
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,720
But in the end,
she was the one left out.

625
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,510
It sucks to be left out.
You two were close, right?

626
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:50,680
But Maria was the one
who badmouthed me first!

627
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,180
All because I didn't
go along with her plan.

628
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:55,390
What plan?

629
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,930
Like I said, she had a plan to become
the center of attention.

630
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,760
She badmouthed me,

631
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:05,550
then she laughed at me
on the bridge after school.

632
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:07,510
That's why...

633
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:12,640
That's when I realized.

634
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,510
She got what she deserved.

635
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,930
Nobody thought as badly
about Maria as me.

636
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:34,890
I had no idea I was so mean.

637
00:49:35,510 --> 00:49:38,720
So mean, and so nasty...

638
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:50,350
Here you go, Ninomiya.

639
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:54,390
- Thanks.
- Let me know when you're done.

640
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:59,720
Misuji, check out my model.

641
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:04,180
It will blow you away.

642
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:32,050
I went to see her.

643
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:34,510
Maria cried.

644
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:38,760
We both apologized for
what we'd done.

645
00:50:38,930 --> 00:50:40,550
My bad, honey.

646
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:43,010
Your honey is bad?

647
00:51:02,510 --> 00:51:03,390
Done!

648
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:05,850
Your rice balls are way too big.

649
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,510
- The more the merrier!
- You're nuts.

650
00:51:11,890 --> 00:51:16,140
The closer we got to autumn,
the bigger Nikuko got.

651
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:21,010
Then, when autumn finally arrived,

652
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,800
the late night phone calls began.

653
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:29,890
Nikuko yells,
even when she whispers.

654
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:32,510
But this time,
she actually kept it down.

655
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,390
Was it that okonomiyaki vendor?

656
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,140
The calls came Tuesday nights.

657
00:51:40,510 --> 00:51:44,430
I saw a dream each week.
A dream, that wasn't a dream...

658
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:47,550
Or something like that.
But I saw them!

659
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,680
I can't wait for my packed lunch!

660
00:51:54,890 --> 00:51:58,180
Today isn't "Packed Lunch Day."
It's "School Sports Day!"

661
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:01,100
I'm gonna kick butt!

662
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:03,200
{\an8}SCHOOL SPORTS DAY

663
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:15,390
The next event is Gymnastic Formation.

664
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,390
Kikurin!

665
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,140
- Did you see a flash?
- Yeah.

666
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,470
That's an ultra C move!

667
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:32,720
Way to go, Kikurin!
You're so good!

668
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:44,640
As the boys fought the Cavalry Battle,
I searched for Ninomiya.

669
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,600
I secretly rooted for Ninomiya.

670
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:11,600
I wanted him to win
and pull a face!

671
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,680
What's that?

672
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:17,510
You were pulling a face.

673
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:20,510
- Yeah, it feels good.
- What?

674
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,640
You're loopy, Kikurin!

675
00:53:23,300 --> 00:53:25,720
Again?
Ask before taking photos!

676
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:43,390
Hey Kiku,
you sure know how to run.

677
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,430
Kikurin's super good at sports.

678
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:53,890
My big race is coming up soon.
The Scavenger Hunt.

679
00:53:54,050 --> 00:53:56,640
- Scavenger hunt?
- I'm gettin' butterflies.

680
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,510
What's wrong, Nikuko?

681
00:54:08,390 --> 00:54:09,680
Those are mine.

682
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,050
Restroom!

683
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,050
Why take the rice balls?

684
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:18,760
You're way too nervous!

685
00:54:19,350 --> 00:54:20,510
What's with her?

686
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:21,890
Kiku.

687
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:25,050
Dig in.

688
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,010
Thank you.

689
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,890
Wow.

690
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:40,050
This is like a textbook version of
"School Sports Day."

691
00:54:41,550 --> 00:54:44,930
The next event is for parents.
The Scavenger Hunt.

692
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:48,350
All participants,
please gather at the gate.

693
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:11,640
Is everyone ready?

694
00:55:13,510 --> 00:55:15,100
On your marks...

695
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:19,220
Oops. Sorry.

696
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:21,140
- Sorry.
- Let's try again.

697
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:26,260
Wait for it!

698
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:28,220
Sorry.

699
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:32,680
Nikuko!
Calm down!

700
00:55:33,390 --> 00:55:34,640
On your marks...

701
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,140
Ready...

702
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,220
He finally got to shoot!

703
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,510
Watanabe's grandfather must find
a jacket!

704
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,800
Hotta's mother must find
reading glasses!

705
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:03,640
Misuji's mother must find...

706
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,390
a novel!

707
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:07,720
A novel?!

708
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:13,100
Novels are books!
Kikurin knows books!

709
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:15,220
Salinger?

710
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:17,050
Anybody got Salinger?

711
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:21,140
A novel! Kikurin! Salinger!

712
00:56:22,010 --> 00:56:23,140
Madam!

713
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,800
Take this.

714
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:29,890
"The Pass"?

715
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,390
Thanks!

716
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:37,470
Thanks so much!

717
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,930
Thanks a bunch!

718
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,390
Nikuko!

719
00:57:05,930 --> 00:57:07,640
You won last place!

720
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,550
Last place?!

721
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:15,390
A season yearned for never comes.

722
00:57:16,430 --> 00:57:19,350
Everyone said this year's winter was odd.

723
00:57:20,010 --> 00:57:25,930
It usually snowed from late November,
but the snow never came.

724
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:29,470
How's your mom doing?

725
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,510
She's doing fine. Great!

726
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,260
Oh, Kikuko! I saw your mom
walking around the other day.

727
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:38,680
Sorry about that.

728
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,510
No need to apologize.

729
00:57:41,550 --> 00:57:43,510
Of course she walks around!

730
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,470
After the sports day,
Nikuko became a town celebrity.

731
00:57:50,180 --> 00:57:51,180
You're back!

732
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:53,180
I am.

733
00:57:54,390 --> 00:57:58,760
Guess what. The lady at Yoshitoku
asked how you were doing.

734
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,430
I'm a celeb now!

735
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:04,640
A celeb?
I'm not sure that's a good thing.

736
00:58:05,050 --> 00:58:08,260
Why not?
You gotta make people notice you.

737
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:10,640
They say bad things about you too.

738
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:12,800
All the better.

739
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:15,510
They can call me
"The happy fat lady at the grill."

740
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:18,470
They can call you
"The pretty kid, so unlike her mom."

741
00:58:18,550 --> 00:58:20,140
But I am Lady Nikuko,

742
00:58:20,260 --> 00:58:22,640
and I love it!

743
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,180
I knew that face.

744
00:58:25,550 --> 00:58:27,180
She had good news.

745
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,890
Was it the okonomiyaki vendor?

746
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:32,430
Kikurin, how was your day?

747
00:58:33,470 --> 00:58:35,140
It was just an ordinary day.

748
00:58:35,260 --> 00:58:38,100
Ordinary?
Ordinary is the best of all.

749
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,300
What's your idea of "ordinary"?

750
00:58:41,010 --> 00:58:42,430
Ordinary goes like this.

751
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:46,760
You eat, poop, study, work,
bathe, then go to sleep.

752
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,010
And fart.

753
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:51,350
If that's your idea of an ordinary life,

754
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:54,640
- nobody in the world leads one.
- How come?

755
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:59,800
Because nobody can live such
a monotonous and uneventful life.

756
00:58:59,930 --> 00:59:04,260
Is that how you'd describe our lives?
You call this "ordinary"?!

757
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:09,430
We eat, poop, study, work,
bathe, fart and sleep.

758
00:59:09,510 --> 00:59:11,220
Then the whole world does.

759
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:12,510
I don't think so!

760
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:16,720
Some people have no food to eat.
Some have no place to live.

761
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,850
You sound like a teacher.

762
00:59:19,010 --> 00:59:20,640
I saw it on TV!

763
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:22,640
Nikuko!

764
00:59:24,890 --> 00:59:26,100
Eat this.

765
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:28,680
I give up.

766
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,510
Nikuko has no idea how I feel.

767
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:39,430
If it doesn't work out with the new guy,
we'll end up moving to the next town.

768
00:59:44,470 --> 00:59:47,510
Would that happen to be
smoke dried tuna?

769
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:49,850
It's sweet potato.

770
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:54,510
You want some?

771
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:12,800
- What's up?
- I'm eating sweet potato.

772
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:14,180
Way out here?

773
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:17,430
What do you mean?
It's right next to our place.

774
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:21,850
The port's not next to your place.
Your place is next to the port.

775
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:23,260
Right.

776
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,050
Where's Nikuko?

777
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:28,050
Getting ready.
She'll leave soon.

778
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:31,390
Oh yeah?
She's put on more weight lately.

779
01:00:31,510 --> 01:00:32,890
She's always eating.

780
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,640
Sassan...

781
01:00:41,390 --> 01:00:44,050
Does her boyfriend come to the grill?

782
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,640
Does she have a man now?

783
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:49,680
Well, I don't want to know,
so I don't ask,

784
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,220
but she's been beaming
since the festival.

785
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:55,800
I thought she might be dating
that blonde guy.

786
01:00:55,930 --> 01:00:57,430
Blonde guy?

787
01:00:57,550 --> 01:01:00,470
What is he again?
A vendor, or something.

788
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,180
I don't really remember.

789
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,640
What a lie.
I remember clearly!

790
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,850
Doesn't ring a bell.

791
01:01:11,680 --> 01:01:12,850
I haven't seen him.

792
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:16,470
Really? Then they must meet
somewhere else.

793
01:01:16,550 --> 01:01:18,510
There's no need to hide it.

794
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,510
I don't think she has a guy.

795
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:23,180
Whatever. I don't mind.

796
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,930
Okay, gotta go.

797
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:27,890
Kiku.

798
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,720
Tonight's staff special
is going to be misuji.

799
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:35,050
What?
Misuji?!

800
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:55,300
Yummy!

801
01:01:56,010 --> 01:01:58,550
He sometimes treats the regulars
to misuji.

802
01:01:59,680 --> 01:02:02,390
It's tasty beyond compare.

803
01:02:02,760 --> 01:02:05,300
I can eat a bowl like this
in one go!

804
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,050
This tastes so good!

805
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,050
What's the difference between
the name Misuji and a bridge?

806
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:16,760
One sounds like meat,
the other's where you meet.

807
01:02:20,350 --> 01:02:23,010
I should've kept that to myself.

808
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:27,050
Maybe that joke was
a little undercooked.

809
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:29,470
Kikurin, you say something?

810
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:30,760
Nope.

811
01:02:31,100 --> 01:02:33,140
- Like it, Kiku?
- It's unreal!

812
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:35,510
Consider it my early Christmas present.

813
01:02:35,640 --> 01:02:37,760
Yay! Merry Christmas!

814
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:42,760
What's the difference between
a party at Uwogashi and Christmas?

815
01:02:43,510 --> 01:02:46,680
One takes the cake,
the other needs a cake!

816
01:02:49,470 --> 01:02:52,300
You guys are cold!
Did someone turn on the AC?

817
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:55,050
Maybe that was me.

818
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:59,100
Nikuko's in high spirits,
but I'm not quite in the mood.

819
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:02,050
I think I know why.

820
01:03:02,510 --> 01:03:05,390
We might be leaving town again.

821
01:03:06,260 --> 01:03:10,050
For some reason,
I had that vague sense of anxiety.

822
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:15,930
- Pull it together!
- I drank too much.

823
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:17,390
Can you make it?

824
01:03:17,930 --> 01:03:19,100
Good night.

825
01:03:19,390 --> 01:03:21,140
Nikuko, we're going!

826
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:23,890
I'm a baby so I can't walk...

827
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:26,510
No baby's as big as you!

828
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:32,140
What were you like as a kid?

829
01:03:32,260 --> 01:03:34,800
- I was really frail.
- You're kidding.

830
01:03:35,050 --> 01:03:38,100
It's true!
I slept all the time.

831
01:03:38,220 --> 01:03:41,300
Then my pop died,
and my mom had to work.

832
01:03:41,430 --> 01:03:43,510
Grandma took care of me.

833
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:45,470
- What was she like?
- She died.

834
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:47,100
- When?
- Junior high.

835
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:49,640
- I cried my eyes out.
- I bet.

836
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,050
She was like your mom, right?

837
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:55,050
Yeah, Mom got a boyfriend...

838
01:03:55,350 --> 01:03:57,760
- I was so lonely!
- You're heavy!

839
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:04,180
But Grandma said she'd stay by my side
even after she died, so I was okay.

840
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,050
- I still am.
- How's that?

841
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:10,300
I've got you,
so I'm not lonely at all!

842
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:14,050
I'm so glad I got you, Kikurin!

843
01:04:14,180 --> 01:04:15,680
Hey Nikuko, look!

844
01:04:17,050 --> 01:04:19,140
Wow, it's so pretty.

845
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,720
The stars might fall
before any snow does.

846
01:04:22,890 --> 01:04:24,510
You're right.

847
01:04:25,010 --> 01:04:29,010
When a "SUN" is "BORN"
you get a "STAR."

848
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:41,760
The next day, I woke up in pain.

849
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:44,850
Could it be food poisoning
from the misuji?!

850
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:47,300
No, or I'd have the runs.

851
01:04:48,350 --> 01:04:53,350
Sassan lets us live here cheap,
as long as we don't get diarrhea.

852
01:04:54,300 --> 01:04:55,760
That's the only condition.

853
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,510
It's not food poisoning.

854
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:00,800
It can't be!

855
01:05:10,890 --> 01:05:11,930
Huh?

856
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:14,510
Your lips look kinda blue.

857
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,760
- Well, today is a bit chilly.
- Caught a cold?

858
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,510
No, I'm fine.

859
01:05:24,390 --> 01:05:25,300
Ow!

860
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:28,180
It's getting worse.

861
01:05:28,470 --> 01:05:29,720
But if I tell her...

862
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,550
- THE KIKURIN SHOW
- What's wrong?!

863
01:05:31,640 --> 01:05:33,850
My stomach's never hurt so bad!

864
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:36,300
Oh no!
Was the misuji bad?!

865
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,050
No way can I tell her!

866
01:05:45,260 --> 01:05:46,140
Sorry, I have- -

867
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:47,800
She beat me!

868
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:51,050
- That was quick!
- We need more paper.

869
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,600
I need to go too.

870
01:05:53,300 --> 01:05:56,350
Kikurin, I'll buy some toilet paper,

871
01:05:56,470 --> 01:05:59,180
and bread,
and a bunch of other stuff.

872
01:05:59,890 --> 01:06:01,720
Yes! I can take medicine.

873
01:06:01,850 --> 01:06:03,640
Kikurin, you okay?

874
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:05,850
- I'm okay!
- You sure?

875
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:10,390
I wish she'd take a hint,
but that's one thing she'll never do.

876
01:06:10,600 --> 01:06:12,510
Alrighty, I'll go then.

877
01:06:13,300 --> 01:06:14,390
Catch you later!

878
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:20,470
We've got nothing!

879
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:22,100
I hate this place!

880
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:23,800
Darn... It hurts!

881
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,010
It hurts like heck!

882
01:06:43,390 --> 01:06:45,140
She was beautiful.

883
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:54,350
Whenever she felt blue,
she gazed at the river.

884
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,350
One day, she left home.

885
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,350
Armed with nothing but her looks,

886
01:07:15,640 --> 01:07:17,550
she found a new river.

887
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:23,120
{\an8}CABARET PHUKET

888
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:31,600
Each time,
she found a new name.

889
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:39,800
Each time,
she left everything behind.

890
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:08,100
When she had almost forgotten
the name she was born with,

891
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,220
she took the name "Miu."

892
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:30,510
Hey there.
Got time to talk?

893
01:08:31,930 --> 01:08:33,640
Don't barge in like that!

894
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,850
My bad, honey.

895
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:40,430
It's raining outside and I'm bored.
I thought we could chat.

896
01:08:40,510 --> 01:08:42,010
Why not?

897
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,100
Why not.

898
01:08:45,510 --> 01:08:47,680
The woman called herself "Daria."

899
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:50,680
The only thing we have in common
is our size.

900
01:08:52,430 --> 01:08:53,600
Gee whiz.

901
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:59,100
She left home in her teens,
and is trying to pay off a lover's debts.

902
01:08:59,640 --> 01:09:02,550
Worse still,
the boyfriend ran away.

903
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,680
Sure you're not being scammed?

904
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:05,890
Probably.

905
01:09:06,550 --> 01:09:07,930
Are you dumb?

906
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:09,220
Yep!

907
01:09:10,390 --> 01:09:11,720
How much do you owe?

908
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,550
So much,
your eyes would pop out!

909
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:20,430
But hey, I'm still alive.

910
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,890
Miu!
You got a customer.

911
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:27,350
Coming!

912
01:09:30,510 --> 01:09:32,850
- Later then.
- Take care now!

913
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:43,800
Daria and Miu moved in together,
and they began fending for each other.

914
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:50,260
It's ready!

915
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:52,050
Bless this food!

916
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:56,350
Daria adored Miu,
like she was her little sister.

917
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,050
Miu came to regard Daria
as her big sister.

918
01:10:07,510 --> 01:10:11,220
- Sis, use this for me.
- What's that?

919
01:10:11,390 --> 01:10:13,680
One of my clients is a good tipper.

920
01:10:13,890 --> 01:10:15,260
Then you keep it.

921
01:10:15,390 --> 01:10:18,220
You should plan your daily expenses
each month.

922
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,260
Then you'll never spend too much.

923
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,180
I can spare this much.

924
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:26,050
We both want to repay our debts
as quickly as possible,

925
01:10:26,260 --> 01:10:28,390
but being too stingy can't be good.

926
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:31,640
I can afford to pay a bit extra.

927
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:37,050
You know what?
It seems I can't have kids.

928
01:10:42,850 --> 01:10:44,050
Keep the money.

929
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,470
Miu...

930
01:10:50,300 --> 01:10:52,760
Do you wanna have a baby?

931
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:00,390
I never thought so,
but now I know I can't,

932
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:02,390
it feels a little lonely.

933
01:11:03,220 --> 01:11:04,300
Huh?

934
01:11:05,350 --> 01:11:06,550
Miu...

935
01:11:07,470 --> 01:11:08,890
Oh, sis!

936
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,510
Quit that funny face!

937
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:13,010
I'm glad you're laughing.

938
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:14,850
She flipped!

939
01:11:15,050 --> 01:11:17,600
- Hey, I'm upside down.
- Calm down, sis!

940
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:20,140
Miu was tough.

941
01:11:20,510 --> 01:11:24,510
She raked in the tips,
and ultimately paid off her debt.

942
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:32,640
Put them in.

943
01:11:33,930 --> 01:11:35,930
It's so swanky.

944
01:11:38,220 --> 01:11:40,300
It smells great!

945
01:11:40,430 --> 01:11:41,850
Just like cake, yeah?

946
01:11:42,220 --> 01:11:43,850
It's ready!

947
01:11:44,470 --> 01:11:46,430
It really is like cake!

948
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,510
Well, today is Christmas Eve.

949
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,550
It's a Christmas cake!

950
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,930
Bless this food!

951
01:11:56,550 --> 01:11:57,800
It's so good!

952
01:11:59,140 --> 01:12:00,220
I'm glad.

953
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:03,220
Sorry, sis.

954
01:12:05,350 --> 01:12:07,470
Miu had a funny feeling.

955
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:11,260
Her period hadn't come
for a long time.

956
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,470
On that sacred night,
she became certain.

957
01:12:15,720 --> 01:12:16,720
Sis!

958
01:12:16,930 --> 01:12:18,140
Yeah?

959
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:21,220
I'm pregnant.

960
01:12:21,430 --> 01:12:23,680
For real?!

961
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:57,140
Does anything exist in the world
that we can believe in totally?

962
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:05,510
Even if such a thing were to exist
we’d pretend not to believe

963
01:13:06,260 --> 01:13:13,260
People who shed melancholy tears
are beautiful, supposedly

964
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:22,260
People who laugh while holding in tears
are beautiful, supposedly

965
01:13:23,050 --> 01:13:30,220
Why do men wander the world
in search of female company?

966
01:13:31,390 --> 01:13:38,260
Why do women doll themselves up
in hope of male company?

967
01:13:39,850 --> 01:13:47,050
I’d like to join forces with deadbeats
and walk side-by-side amiably

968
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:55,510
Deadbeats also might join forces with me
and walk side-by-side affably

969
01:13:56,510 --> 01:14:03,930
If everybody could see into the hearts
of those who fight endlessly

970
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:12,350
The hearts of those fighting endlessly
surely wouldn’t burn so brightly

971
01:14:13,300 --> 01:14:20,550
I used to fear hurting and getting hurt
but now that’s far behind me

972
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:29,390
The power of people to hurt and get hurt
is part of our history

973
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:53,260
Miu!

974
01:15:00,350 --> 01:15:03,850
- My baby's a girl.
- A girl?

975
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:06,470
That means she's not a boy!

976
01:15:06,550 --> 01:15:10,550
Can I name her after you, sis?

977
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:19,100
Kiku, you're awake?

978
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,220
You okay?

979
01:15:25,100 --> 01:15:26,680
You don't feel sick?

980
01:15:27,720 --> 01:15:28,850
I'm okay.

981
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:34,010
They say you had appendicitis.

982
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:40,260
- What about the grill?
- Don't worry about that.

983
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:42,430
You toughed it out?

984
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:46,350
They say you nearly
gave yourself peritonitis.

985
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:48,260
Did they operate on me?

986
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:51,800
They did.
So you have to stay still.

987
01:15:52,510 --> 01:15:53,890
Where's Nikuko?

988
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:58,680
- Getting details about your admission.
- I have to be admitted?

989
01:15:58,850 --> 01:16:02,680
Of course you do.
Just for a week or so.

990
01:16:03,510 --> 01:16:05,010
A week...

991
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:07,220
I'm sorry.

992
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:09,510
Why apologize?

993
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:11,640
I'm so sorry.

994
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:13,010
Kiku.

995
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:15,140
Kiku!

996
01:16:16,050 --> 01:16:18,050
Why did you tough it out?

997
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,470
Kiku, look at me.

998
01:16:24,260 --> 01:16:27,890
Don't tell me
you did it because of me.

999
01:16:31,470 --> 01:16:35,680
Because I said you mustn't get the runs?
Is that why you toughed it out?

1000
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:39,510
So that was why.

1001
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,350
I'm sorry.

1002
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:42,890
Why?

1003
01:16:43,930 --> 01:16:46,180
Why couldn't you tell me?

1004
01:16:47,890 --> 01:16:49,010
Because...

1005
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,390
Because of what?

1006
01:16:51,930 --> 01:16:54,930
Because I wasn't supposed to be born.

1007
01:16:57,220 --> 01:17:00,700
{\an8}MISUJI KIKUKO

1008
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:11,720
You're alive, aren't you?

1009
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,140
Get it? You're alive.

1010
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:19,640
You'll make mistakes your whole life.
Don't be scared of them.

1011
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,430
You could act more like a kid,

1012
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:26,140
but "acting like a kid" is
just a thing adults made up.

1013
01:17:26,390 --> 01:17:29,010
The only thing we should act like
is ourselves.

1014
01:17:29,140 --> 01:17:33,640
But in the same way no kid is perfect,
no adult is perfect either.

1015
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:38,300
So no matter how hard you try
to be a proper adult,

1016
01:17:38,430 --> 01:17:40,550
you're going to struggle and mess up.

1017
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:43,180
There's no doubt about it.

1018
01:17:43,430 --> 01:17:46,510
The best you can do is
prepare yourself for it.

1019
01:17:47,010 --> 01:17:49,350
Mess up while you're still a kid.

1020
01:17:49,470 --> 01:17:53,350
Cause trouble. Get into trouble.
Get some emotional scars.

1021
01:17:53,470 --> 01:17:55,760
And go on living, okay?

1022
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:58,550
It's okay to cause trouble.

1023
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:01,390
I won't go easy on you.

1024
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,510
We're not strangers.

1025
01:18:04,100 --> 01:18:05,470
You got that, Kiku?

1026
01:18:06,640 --> 01:18:09,430
I'll scold you,
because we're family.

1027
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:13,220
And that means you can't
tiptoe around me either.

1028
01:18:14,260 --> 01:18:15,890
Everything will be okay.

1029
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:24,510
Kiku.

1030
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:30,680
You were supposed to be born!

1031
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:45,300
What the heck?!
This really snaps shut.

1032
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:46,850
Calm down.

1033
01:18:49,550 --> 01:18:51,300
Is this all you brought?

1034
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,180
Thanks a bunch.
Thanks- -

1035
01:18:53,300 --> 01:18:55,140
See you, Kiku.
I'll be back.

1036
01:18:58,050 --> 01:19:00,180
Thanks a bunch.
I owe you.

1037
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:01,850
So much.

1038
01:19:02,180 --> 01:19:03,890
I owe... Oh, Kikurin!

1039
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:05,180
You okay?

1040
01:19:05,300 --> 01:19:07,510
Are you in pain?
Do you feel sick?

1041
01:19:08,050 --> 01:19:09,100
Kikurin!

1042
01:19:10,140 --> 01:19:11,510
I'm fine.

1043
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,470
You are?

1044
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:15,470
You had an operation.

1045
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:18,550
You're gonna have a tiny scar.

1046
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,510
But you're safe now.

1047
01:19:20,680 --> 01:19:22,510
It won't hurt anymore.

1048
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:27,470
- I'm sor- -
- I'm sorry!

1049
01:19:27,600 --> 01:19:31,430
I should've realized you
had a sore stomach.

1050
01:19:31,550 --> 01:19:32,680
I'm sorry.

1051
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:34,050
I'm so sorry!

1052
01:19:42,510 --> 01:19:44,640
Looks like we're moving again.

1053
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:47,390
Go beyond!

1054
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:50,600
- Nikuko.
- Yeah?

1055
01:19:50,720 --> 01:19:52,760
What is it?
Does it hurt?

1056
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:55,050
No. I know...

1057
01:19:55,220 --> 01:19:56,220
Know what?

1058
01:19:56,350 --> 01:19:58,510
You're not my mom, are you?

1059
01:20:08,640 --> 01:20:09,760
Kikurin...

1060
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,930
Actually,
I've known since I was about four.

1061
01:20:15,220 --> 01:20:16,890
You're that surprised?

1062
01:20:17,470 --> 01:20:19,140
We look nothing alike.

1063
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,510
Kikurin...

1064
01:20:22,510 --> 01:20:24,300
And I saw that photo.

1065
01:20:24,890 --> 01:20:27,470
The one with you and that lady.

1066
01:20:28,140 --> 01:20:29,890
She's my mom, right?

1067
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:34,430
Of course I figured it out.
We're the spitting image.

1068
01:20:35,470 --> 01:20:37,050
And one more thing.

1069
01:20:37,470 --> 01:20:38,430
Yes?

1070
01:20:38,510 --> 01:20:41,010
You're on the phone a lot lately.

1071
01:20:41,890 --> 01:20:44,260
Don't hold back because of me.

1072
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:46,350
Call whenever you like.

1073
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:48,430
You know I'm grateful.

1074
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:52,640
You brought me up. All the way.
And I'm not even your kid.

1075
01:20:53,260 --> 01:20:55,850
And I'm gonna need you
for a while longer too.

1076
01:20:56,010 --> 01:20:57,510
I truly am grateful.

1077
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:01,430
So, never hold back on my account.

1078
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,010
It's the okonomiyaki guy, right?

1079
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:08,760
The okonomiyaki guy.

1080
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:12,220
What's that?
A scary movie?

1081
01:21:12,390 --> 01:21:15,180
No.
He's your new boyfriend, right?

1082
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:17,260
It's nothing to hide.

1083
01:21:17,390 --> 01:21:20,140
I want you to find
your own happiness.

1084
01:21:20,430 --> 01:21:23,100
I mean that from
the bottom of my heart.

1085
01:21:23,260 --> 01:21:24,640
What boyfriend?

1086
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:27,510
Isn't he the one you call at night?

1087
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:30,930
Rather not say?

1088
01:21:31,800 --> 01:21:35,050
Kikurin, promise you won't freak out.

1089
01:21:37,550 --> 01:21:38,720
Promise!

1090
01:21:39,220 --> 01:21:40,640
I can handle it.

1091
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:43,720
Those phone calls...

1092
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:47,100
They're from your real mom.

1093
01:21:50,100 --> 01:21:51,930
Are you freaking out?!

1094
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,550
But listen.

1095
01:21:53,680 --> 01:21:55,760
It's true. I swear.

1096
01:21:55,890 --> 01:21:57,760
She really loves you.

1097
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,470
And you know what?
Miu got married.

1098
01:22:02,550 --> 01:22:04,890
And finally, she got pregnant!

1099
01:22:05,050 --> 01:22:07,600
Miu grew up,
and found someone who loves her,

1100
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,550
and now she realizes
how precious children are.

1101
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:14,180
But that doesn't mean
you weren't precious to her.

1102
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:16,260
She wanted you so much.
It's true!

1103
01:22:16,390 --> 01:22:18,930
She cried about how much
she wanted a baby.

1104
01:22:19,180 --> 01:22:22,050
But she was too young
back then.

1105
01:22:22,180 --> 01:22:23,930
She was scared.

1106
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:26,930
But now she's older,
and pregnant again,

1107
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:30,510
she said she realizes
how awful she was to you.

1108
01:22:30,640 --> 01:22:34,350
She says she realizes
how precious you are!

1109
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:38,430
She realizes how awful she was?
So she abandoned me?

1110
01:22:40,350 --> 01:22:43,010
And my mom's name is Miu?

1111
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,510
Don't worry, I can handle it.

1112
01:22:47,050 --> 01:22:48,680
So, who's my dad?

1113
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,760
She doesn't even know herself.

1114
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,680
I can handle it.
What else?

1115
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:58,300
Well, Miu and I were
living together.

1116
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,510
One day I came home,
and you were alone.

1117
01:23:00,640 --> 01:23:03,180
She was gone?
She ran away.

1118
01:23:03,390 --> 01:23:04,800
She didn't run away!

1119
01:23:04,930 --> 01:23:08,050
She just got scared.
That's all.

1120
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:11,800
You were precious to her.
You really, really were.

1121
01:23:12,010 --> 01:23:14,300
That's right!
Look at this.

1122
01:23:14,470 --> 01:23:17,430
This is the letter and money
she left behind.

1123
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:22,430
- She left this, and some breast milk.
- PLEASE TAKE CARE OF HER

1124
01:23:37,430 --> 01:23:39,850
She did the best she could.

1125
01:23:40,010 --> 01:23:42,640
She didn’t abandon you.
She was hurting.

1126
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:44,510
And she was so young.

1127
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,430
And she's never stopped
thinking about you.

1128
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:49,220
She said so herself.

1129
01:23:49,470 --> 01:23:50,510
So what?

1130
01:23:51,050 --> 01:23:53,470
What's with the phone calls?

1131
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:54,720
Well...

1132
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,600
Does she want to see me?

1133
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,600
No. She just wants to know
how you're doing.

1134
01:24:01,720 --> 01:24:03,720
She wants to know you're okay.

1135
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:07,100
She said she searched for us,
all the land over.

1136
01:24:07,220 --> 01:24:09,850
She even...
She came to the sports day!

1137
01:24:10,300 --> 01:24:11,760
She did?!

1138
01:24:12,470 --> 01:24:13,930
That was her!

1139
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:18,180
You took rice balls to the restroom
that day.

1140
01:24:18,300 --> 01:24:20,010
- Yikes...
- Cut it out.

1141
01:24:20,140 --> 01:24:22,050
Were they for her?

1142
01:24:22,430 --> 01:24:24,680
How did you get so sharp?

1143
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:30,930
Miu came all the way from Kobe.

1144
01:24:31,140 --> 01:24:33,760
Just to see you
at your sports day.

1145
01:24:34,300 --> 01:24:38,600
And then, when Miu ate the rice balls,
she started crying.

1146
01:24:38,720 --> 01:24:42,510
You looked so pretty,
and had grown up so much.

1147
01:24:42,600 --> 01:24:46,050
She was so happy,
she bawled her eyes out.

1148
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,550
So I told her.

1149
01:24:53,100 --> 01:24:56,010
"I don't know if Kikurin's happy or not,

1150
01:24:56,470 --> 01:25:01,850
but I'll do whatever I can for her,
with all of my might."

1151
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:07,430
But if you wanna see Miu,

1152
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:09,760
or if you wanna live with her,

1153
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:11,930
just say so, okay?

1154
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:14,600
You know what I'm like.

1155
01:25:15,220 --> 01:25:17,640
I'm a poor excuse for a mother.

1156
01:25:17,800 --> 01:25:22,180
But Miu is married to a rich guy
and seems happy now.

1157
01:25:23,050 --> 01:25:28,220
If you say you wanna live with her,
I know she'll be happy.

1158
01:25:28,350 --> 01:25:29,680
Yeah...

1159
01:25:31,550 --> 01:25:34,350
That would be sad for me,

1160
01:25:35,930 --> 01:25:40,600
but if it...
makes you happy...

1161
01:25:42,600 --> 01:25:45,850
Nikuko is such a fool.

1162
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:49,300
Such a total and utter fool.

1163
01:25:50,470 --> 01:25:51,390
Nikuko.

1164
01:25:53,050 --> 01:25:54,350
Kikurin!

1165
01:25:54,640 --> 01:25:57,180
I don't want to be like you.

1166
01:25:58,510 --> 01:26:00,390
It's not just your looks.

1167
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:04,260
You say and do dumb things too.

1168
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:08,510
But even so,

1169
01:26:10,100 --> 01:26:12,760
I love you, Nikuko.

1170
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:18,790
{\an8}PROBLEM CHILD

1171
01:26:24,930 --> 01:26:28,390
Cheer up, Mom!
You can do it!

1172
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:41,010
Feel better?

1173
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:46,890
Way better.

1174
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:49,680
- Thanks honey.
- Mommy!

1175
01:26:49,890 --> 01:26:51,300
I love you!

1176
01:26:57,010 --> 01:26:58,890
I love you so much, Nikuko.

1177
01:27:00,100 --> 01:27:01,800
Kikurin!

1178
01:27:02,800 --> 01:27:04,850
I love you, Nikuko.

1179
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,100
I love you.

1180
01:27:11,800 --> 01:27:13,510
Wanna eat some noodles?

1181
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:15,720
Kikurin!

1182
01:27:16,800 --> 01:27:18,850
Do you want noodles, or not?

1183
01:27:20,220 --> 01:27:24,600
Nikuko kept crying,
on and on and on.

1184
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:31,800
Kikurin, get well soon!

1185
01:27:32,510 --> 01:27:34,100
Thank you!

1186
01:27:35,140 --> 01:27:36,550
This is for you, too.

1187
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:40,220
- It's a great movie.
- Thanks!

1188
01:27:40,350 --> 01:27:41,470
Kikurin...

1189
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:43,510
What's this?

1190
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:45,640
That's...

1191
01:27:46,430 --> 01:27:51,390
The hospital gave special permission
for Nikuko to stay with me.

1192
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:58,180
And the day before I went home,
Ninomiya came to see me.

1193
01:28:05,050 --> 01:28:07,140
- What's this?
- The bill.

1194
01:28:07,550 --> 01:28:10,220
Apparently you only pay
when you leave.

1195
01:28:10,640 --> 01:28:13,260
But Nikuko tried to pay
the day I came.

1196
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:15,140
You have a great mom.

1197
01:28:20,350 --> 01:28:22,010
- Ninomiya.
- Yeah?

1198
01:28:22,180 --> 01:28:24,760
- You really are weird.
- Huh?

1199
01:28:24,890 --> 01:28:27,510
Do you hide your weirdness
from everyone else?

1200
01:28:27,640 --> 01:28:30,800
I don't have to worry about it
when I'm with you.

1201
01:28:31,430 --> 01:28:32,600
Why not?!

1202
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:35,300
Because you're weird too.

1203
01:28:35,430 --> 01:28:37,390
I'm weird?!
How?

1204
01:28:37,930 --> 01:28:40,050
You talk to yourself so much.

1205
01:28:40,390 --> 01:28:43,050
When you see a seagull you say,
"Go beyond!"

1206
01:28:43,180 --> 01:28:45,680
When you see a lizard you say,
"I'm late!"

1207
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,430
You always yell stuff.

1208
01:28:47,550 --> 01:28:49,510
And you do the same pose!

1209
01:28:49,640 --> 01:28:51,760
You're way weirder than me.

1210
01:28:51,890 --> 01:28:54,180
But saying those things
makes it more fun.

1211
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,930
You're nuts!

1212
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:05,140
Are you still making your model?

1213
01:29:08,470 --> 01:29:09,600
Did you finish it?

1214
01:29:10,100 --> 01:29:12,850
That model won't ever be finished.

1215
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:16,390
Misuji.

1216
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:18,390
It's snowing.

1217
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:36,720
Why does this light feel so familiar?

1218
01:29:38,260 --> 01:29:40,140
It's like the light I saw then.

1219
01:29:41,260 --> 01:29:42,800
That glimmer of hope.

1220
01:29:44,050 --> 01:29:45,220
And...

1221
01:29:46,550 --> 01:29:48,890
Ninomiya's model that day.

1222
01:29:55,010 --> 01:29:59,140
His model was of
a tiny seaside town.

1223
01:30:01,470 --> 01:30:08,140
It was full of the present day,
past memories, and dreams for the future.

1224
01:30:12,470 --> 01:30:14,800
Everything became enwrapped in light.

1225
01:30:15,100 --> 01:30:17,680
The light overflowed and rose to the sky.

1226
01:30:20,510 --> 01:30:23,930
Then it showered down on
this little port town.

1227
01:30:26,430 --> 01:30:30,600
The snow probably
won't melt till spring.

1228
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,680
Kikurin, what did you pray for?

1229
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:56,050
Hey, it's bad luck to tell others.

1230
01:30:56,180 --> 01:30:59,140
When I prayed, my mind went blank.

1231
01:30:59,260 --> 01:31:01,430
All I could say was, "Hello."

1232
01:31:01,720 --> 01:31:03,050
You're so silly.

1233
01:31:03,180 --> 01:31:04,760
What a waste.

1234
01:31:06,890 --> 01:31:09,140
But I know what you mean.

1235
01:31:09,600 --> 01:31:11,760
It's so sea-ish!

1236
01:31:11,890 --> 01:31:13,850
What kind of comment is that?

1237
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:19,680
Ta-da!

1238
01:31:20,890 --> 01:31:22,390
What's that?

1239
01:31:22,510 --> 01:31:24,930
A New Year's treat.
Red and white sweets!

1240
01:31:25,050 --> 01:31:26,890
I got them at the shrine.

1241
01:31:30,350 --> 01:31:31,510
My stomach hurts.

1242
01:31:32,350 --> 01:31:34,180
You're still not over it?

1243
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:38,010
Don't worry.
This is a different kind of pain.

1244
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,180
Whoa. They're both red!

1245
01:31:41,680 --> 01:31:43,510
- Nikuko!
- What?

1246
01:31:48,930 --> 01:31:50,010
Kikurin...

1247
01:32:01,050 --> 01:32:02,300
Congratulations.

1248
01:32:09,050 --> 01:32:12,180
Nikuko: Shinobu Otake

1249
01:32:12,390 --> 01:32:15,140
Kikuko: Cocomi

1250
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:17,680
Ninomiya: Natsuki Hanae

1251
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:21,430
I’ve been searching for you

1252
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:30,010
On the first day I met you
I couldn’t express how I truly felt

1253
01:32:31,050 --> 01:32:37,260
Your face turned serious
and you cast your eyes down

1254
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:41,260
While I gazed at you helplessly

1255
01:32:42,760 --> 01:32:45,760
I’m bursting with love for you

1256
01:32:45,930 --> 01:32:48,930
A beating in my heart I can’t hide

1257
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:55,350
It all happened by chance,
so suddenly

1258
01:32:55,760 --> 01:33:02,010
All I do is smile with you, my love
as days go by uneventfully

1259
01:33:02,140 --> 01:33:07,760
What I can’t express
becomes a serenade

1260
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:14,220
In the sky on a lonely night
a star twinkles brightly

1261
01:33:14,350 --> 01:33:20,600
If you’re watching it too,
let’s talk a while

1262
01:33:21,550 --> 01:33:24,640
I’ve been searching for you

1263
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:31,640
Beneath the same sky
I’m so glad we found each other

1264
01:33:33,300 --> 01:33:36,350
We may not always see eye to eye

1265
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:39,470
But I always want you to know

1266
01:33:39,600 --> 01:33:45,640
Words can never surpass
what I feel in my heart

1267
01:33:46,350 --> 01:33:52,470
All you do is smile with me, my love
as days go by uneventfully

1268
01:33:52,640 --> 01:33:58,430
We call each other’s names
to make sure we’re still there

1269
01:33:58,720 --> 01:34:04,760
In the same place, same time
we mean so much to each other

1270
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:11,220
In the days to come
let’s find that meaning together

1271
01:34:12,510 --> 01:34:17,680
I can never express
how much I love you

1272
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:22,930
So I’ll make sure my destiny with you

1273
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:27,510
is carried by this melody

1274
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:34,600
I can only pray it gets through

1275
01:34:38,180 --> 01:34:43,010
I'll smile for you when you're sad

1276
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:46,260
Because I’ll always be by your side

1277
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:51,890
Never forget the joy you always bring

1278
01:34:52,300 --> 01:34:58,430
On days when it rains
I’ll always open an umbrella

1279
01:34:58,550 --> 01:35:02,510
Let’s walk together
shoulder to shoulder

1280
01:35:02,640 --> 01:35:08,350
When I’m sad and start to cry
I know you’ll smile for me

1281
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:14,050
Stay with me always
through tears and tomorrows

1282
01:35:14,300 --> 01:35:20,510
I hope that beyond our goodbyes
we’ll still be able to smile

1283
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:26,720
The rain will lift before we know it

1284
01:35:26,890 --> 01:35:33,140
We met by chance
By chance, you’re beside me

1285
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:38,180
But not by chance,
because I’ve been searching for you

1286
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:41,640
MY MOM

1287
01:35:41,720 --> 01:35:50,220
PROBLEM CHILD

1288
01:35:50,430 --> 01:35:54,100
My daughter said,
"I'll look after you when you get old."

1289
01:35:54,220 --> 01:35:57,390
I was so happy.
She said, "I'll change your diapers."

1290
01:35:57,510 --> 01:36:01,010
I was about to cry, then she said,
"But do your own wiping."

1291
01:36:01,180 --> 01:36:04,100
- How can she not wipe?
- He never shuts up.

1292
01:36:05,640 --> 01:36:07,350
-I'm done for, too.

1293
01:36:05,660 --> 01:36:09,360
The End
