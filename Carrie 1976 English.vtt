59:56.942 --> 59:59.699
And he was 6'7" tall,

59:59.779 --> 01:00:03.198
so I went out and bought a pair
of three-inch spike heels

01:00:03.282 --> 01:00:07.620
so our kiss goodnight would be
less awkward.

01:00:07.788 --> 01:00:10.456
So anyway, we went in his pick-up truck,

01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.957

- Trust me, Carrie. You can trust me.

01:17:32.001 --> 01:17:33.210
Trust me, Carrie.

Mama?

Mama. Mama. It was bad, Mama.
They laughed at me.

01:26:21.908 --> 01:26:23.408
Mama, hold me.

Hold me, Mama. Please, hold me!

01:26:42.428 --> 01:26:45.597
I should have killed myself
when he put it in me.

01:26:47.225 --> 01:26:51.687
After the first time, before we were
married, Ralph promised never again.

01:26:54.732 --> 01:26:57.651
He promised. And I believed him.

01:27:00.905 --> 01:27:02.657
But sin never dies.

01:27:04.451 --> 01:27:06.244
Sin never dies.

01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.499
At first it was all right.
We lived sinlessly.

01:27:12.793 --> 01:27:15.795
We slept in the same bed,
but we never did it.

01:27:18.048 --> 01:27:20.967
And then, that night,

01:27:23.595 --> 01:27:26.264
I saw him looking down at me that way.

01:27:31.061 --> 01:27:34.063
We got down on our knees
to pray for strength.

01:27:36.275 --> 01:27:38.651
I smelt the whisky on his breath.

01:27:40.696 --> 01:27:42.321
And he took me.

01:27:43.949 --> 01:27:45.283
He took me

01:27:47.494 --> 01:27:51.581
with the stink of the filthy
roadhouse whisky on his breath.

01:27:51.999 --> 01:27:53.541
And I liked it.

01:27:54.209 --> 01:27:56.127
I liked it.

01:27:58.672 --> 01:28:03.092
With all that dirty touching
of his hands all over me.

01:28:03.927 --> 01:28:07.138
I should have given you to God
when you were born.

01:28:08.098 --> 01:28:10.391
But I was weak and backsliding.

01:28:15.022 --> 01:28:17.523
And now the devil has come home.

01:28:22.571 --> 01:28:25.114
- We'll pray.
- Yes.

01:28:29.703 --> 01:28:32.789
We'll pray.

01:28:33.832 --> 01:28:36.667
For the last time, we'll pray.

Yeah, well, we're all a little edgy.

She's better. Sleeping too much, I guess,

01:34:30.898 --> 01:34:35.360
but Dr. Schneider said that's to be
expected after all she's been through.

01:34:37.280 --> 01:34:42.159
Well, he said that she's young enough
so that she'll forget all about it in time.

01:34:42.702 --> 01:34:45.538
No. I wouldn't let her go to the funerals.
