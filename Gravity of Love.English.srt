1
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:47,083
This world is ridiculous.

2
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:53,833
Human relationships are annoying.

3
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:02,291
Love is not enough to make
this world a better place.

4
00:01:10,041 --> 00:01:10,916
Fah?

5
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:14,000
Your bride looks loaded.

6
00:01:14,833 --> 00:01:18,708
So give me back the 5,000 you borrowed.

7
00:01:21,333 --> 00:01:22,333
Look at you.

8
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,958
You ate the whole plate of fried shrimp.

9
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:27,916
I don't want to keep doing this.
We should break up.

10
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,875
But we can't, Ball.

11
00:01:30,666 --> 00:01:33,208
Don't you remember?
We are bound by destiny.

12
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:34,791
It can't be.

13
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:41,541
So give me back the 5,000 you borrowed.

14
00:01:43,916 --> 00:01:45,291
WATCHARA APARTMENT - INVOICE

15
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,166
Don't pretend to forget.

16
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:50,583
Why ask for it now?

17
00:01:51,083 --> 00:01:53,333
This is a wedding.
We don't have money with us.

18
00:02:00,083 --> 00:02:01,833
One thousand baht!

19
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,500
Hello!

20
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,083
Mr. Charas.

21
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,833
She knows me.

22
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:12,416
Thank you, sir.

23
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,166
Thank you.

24
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,083
Let me see how much.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,958
How could you? 200 baht?

26
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,625
From the whole family, 200!

27
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:25,250
That's tough.

28
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:30,791
I'm one of those
who was trapped in destiny,

29
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:34,583
holding onto something I can never have.

30
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,125
Chasing tirelessly,

31
00:02:36,208 --> 00:02:37,875
knowing I have no chance,

32
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,666
I still manage to make a mess of my life.

33
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,166
Hello, Mother.

34
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,666
We can't be together.

35
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,208
Why not?

36
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,833
Your family health... there's a high risk
of diabetes and hypertension.

37
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:09,416
I don't want my children to risk it.

38
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,041
Don't you remember our destiny?

39
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,041
With this medical test,
it would be beyond destiny.

40
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,375
Where is the bride, doc?

41
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,166
I only saw the bride's mother.

42
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,166
What did you call me?

43
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:23,833
I'm the bride.

44
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,791
Can't you tell from my gown?

45
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,666
This is haute couture from France.

46
00:03:27,875 --> 00:03:29,083
Who invited you?

47
00:03:29,541 --> 00:03:30,375
Doc did.

48
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:34,833
He told me that he has gonorrhea

49
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:36,333
and he hasn't recovered yet.

50
00:03:36,416 --> 00:03:37,791
Now he is getting married.

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,875
Congratulations.

52
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,500
You had me tested and everything,

53
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:43,583
and you have venereal disease?

54
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,208
Why am I serious about destiny?

55
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,041
Maybe because my writer mom

56
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,750
narrated this in her romantic novel,

57
00:04:00,833 --> 00:04:03,458
"When Destiny decides Love"

58
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:06,208
I read it from cover to cover.

59
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,583
It made my young self
believe and become deeply attached.

60
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,958
A short plain Jane like you...

61
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,666
has had three ex-boyfriends?

62
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:22,208
Oh my, oh my...
What my should it be?

63
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:23,833
My rock.

64
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:26,625
Don't tell me that your third

65
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,833
is that rocker
who chatted you up at the shop?

66
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:32,083
Yeah, that hot rocker.

67
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:35,583
First I thought you were the one,

68
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,000
but you really weren't.

69
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:42,000
You live a strange life,
different from ordinary people

70
00:04:42,166 --> 00:04:43,083
like my friends and me.

71
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,166
How did you know he is getting married?
Did he invite you?

72
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:48,916
No, someone told me.

73
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,375
I hope you're not thinking of going there.

74
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:52,458
She won't.

75
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,875
Those rockers are a different species.

76
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:56,375
Stay away from them.

77
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,333
But in reality,

78
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,541
there are tens of billions of lives.

79
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:05,166
Destiny doesn't have time for all of us.

80
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:22,791
Looks like the wrong wedding.

81
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:44,500
Oh, that queer tricked me!

82
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,875
Just for cheap cosmetics, huh?

83
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,500
Easy. Easy.

84
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,125
Two jugs of beer.

85
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:56,291
Yes, ma'am.

86
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:58,375
Why order more? You're drunk.

87
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:00,458
Let's go home and rest.

88
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,250
Bas, take her home.
I'll stay and drink more.

89
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,916
For what?

90
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,708
For wrecking the
after-party of that queer.

91
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,750
Hey.

92
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:13,125
Are you kidding?

93
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:14,916
I'll do what I said.

94
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:17,916
SUVARNABHUMI AIRPORT

95
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,416
Is it the same guy
that's picking you up?

96
00:06:21,875 --> 00:06:23,541
Of course.

97
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:34,958
Bas. You miss me, right?

98
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,541
So much, Tae!

99
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,166
Come save your best friend

100
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,625
from the hands of devil now!

101
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,125
What is it about?
Talk like normal human, will you?

102
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:45,083
I can't keep up with your queer slang.

103
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,666
Fah is drunk?

104
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,000
Who took her out to drink then?

105
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,166
We were worried that
she would wreck the wedding,

106
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:56,208
so we convinced her to drink some beer.

107
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:57,625
Thought it'd be a little bit,

108
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,583
just enough for her
to get sleepy and go home.

109
00:06:59,666 --> 00:07:03,083
But she kept drinking in the bar.

110
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,125
Then she went to pee,

111
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,541
and never came out of the toilet.

112
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,333
Beer is trying to
find her in the wedding party.

113
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,000
I don't know how it goes.

114
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,083
You're dressed formally.

115
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,166
It must be for the uniform-themed wedding.

116
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,875
I just found out
there are two wedding events.

117
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,416
Hope you didn't go to the wrong one.

118
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,875
Zen, you are cheeky.

119
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,541
After realizing it's not that party,
you left me.

120
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:39,083
I thought you'd like it.

121
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,458
Music!

122
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,583
Singers, wait.

123
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:05,333
Where is the bride?

124
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:07,708
Let your ex give you a toast.

125
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,791
Who brought this hippo on the stage?

126
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,666
Where is the bride?

127
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,708
Ton, where the hell are you?

128
00:08:17,125 --> 00:08:18,833
Come out so I can give you a toast.

129
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,750
Pull her down, hurry.

130
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:23,916
-Ton.
-Fah.

131
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,125
Stop. Don't say anything.

132
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,333
I'm sorry, Hippo.

133
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,125
You are in the wrong party.

134
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,750
Your ex is in the other room downstairs.

135
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,875
Come on.

136
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,000
Oops, my bad!

137
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,833
Sorry. I'm your biggest fan.

138
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:42,541
Come on, this is embarrassing.

139
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,750
Where are we going?

140
00:08:46,166 --> 00:08:49,541
Just tell Fah I bought the souvenir
for her mom.

141
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,666
If she wants it,
be nice and don't come around.

142
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,666
Hey Bro!

143
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,375
Bro, come hide over here.

144
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,250
-What?
-Hurry or our team's gonna lose.

145
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:05,375
What team? I'm not a guest here.

146
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,916
Oh, damn it.

147
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,041
What a troublemaker.

148
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,541
Hold on!

149
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:16,166
Tae, don't shout at us.

150
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,666
I didn't want to lose her.

151
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,291
But she's just gone.

152
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,291
She always causes trouble.

153
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:26,458
Zen.

154
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,500
You said you'd stay for the after party?

155
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,708
Of course, but I found this bag.

156
00:09:32,791 --> 00:09:34,166
Someone must have dropped it.

157
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,041
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

158
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:51,000
Can I buy that stuff in the bag?

159
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,333
It's not mine.

160
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm looking for the owner.

161
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,375
It's mine!

162
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,416
I left it a while ago.

163
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,083
Can I take it back? Please.

164
00:09:58,208 --> 00:09:59,125
Wait.

165
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,333
You just said

166
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,708
you wanted to buy it.

167
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,333
Now you're the owner?

168
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,041
Which is it then?

169
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,291
You don't believe me?

170
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:11,875
Kobori!

171
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:13,583
Hey!

172
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,708
"NO DRUNK DRIVING" CAMPAIGN

173
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:55,958
Who put the light sign there?
People may run into it.

174
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,875
So we know who's drunk.

175
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,541
They won't need the breathalyzer.

176
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:02,458
Let me have you tested.

177
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,625
But I'm not the driver.

178
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:07,833
Don't have me tested.

179
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,083
George is driving.

180
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:16,125
Test him instead.

181
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,000
How much should I laugh at this gag?

182
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,500
What's your name?

183
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:38,875
Officer,

184
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,375
-can I borrow your phone?
-Why?

185
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,500
-To call my friend.
-Where is yours?

186
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,250
It's dead.

187
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:47,583
All right, what's the number?

188
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:51,583
Zero, eight, four,

189
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,666
six, six,

190
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,791
five, two, one.

191
00:11:58,083 --> 00:11:59,291
Unable to press number one.

192
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:00,666
Can I press number two instead?

193
00:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,625
You are so funny.

194
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,583
One can't be lonely around you.

195
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:08,083
Wanna kill loneliness?

196
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:13,250
Then let loneliness kill you.

197
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,791
Once loneliness is dead,
you've killed loneliness.

198
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,333
How much should I laugh at this?

199
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,125
Someone bailed you out.

200
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,500
You can go now.

201
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,041
He bailed me out? Are you sure?

202
00:12:45,125 --> 00:12:46,041
Stay if you want.

203
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:47,625
No. No. No. No.

204
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,541
-My car key?
-Outside.

205
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:54,500
Thank you.

206
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:01,916
Hey.

207
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,208
Time proves what's right,
but kaffir leaf is a spice.

208
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:09,583
The first one because of fried shrimp.

209
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:12,166
The next one because of health.

210
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,541
And the last one is a queer.

211
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:16,833
Really?

212
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:21,041
How's my love life?

213
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,291
Isn't that great, folks?

214
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:26,791
I don't think you should have
wrecked their wedding.

215
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,333
Oh, I forgot. I don't want ginger.

216
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:30,625
Waiter.

217
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,583
It's all right.

218
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,625
You don't like ginger?

219
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,875
I'll have it. My favourite.

220
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,625
Here you are.

221
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,791
What's your name?

222
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:39,958
Zen.

223
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:44,000
Zen, like the shopping mall?

224
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:46,083
Like Japanese Buddhism.

225
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:47,083
I know.

226
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,166
It's so strange.

227
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,666
-I think we've met before.
-When?

228
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:57,708
I have ordered Nam-Neaung.

229
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,166
Right, one moment.

230
00:13:59,333 --> 00:14:00,416
We can't break up.

231
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:02,708
We are bound together by destiny.

232
00:14:03,208 --> 00:14:04,291
I don't think we are.

233
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,708
Give me back the 5,000 you borrowed.

234
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:13,333
Excuse me.

235
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,375
Do you know where the blood lab is?

236
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,458
I'm not a nurse.

237
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,041
Can't you tell?

238
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,250
I think it must have been you.

239
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,125
It's so strange that I can remember.

240
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:31,333
Look, and here we are.

241
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,375
Nonsense.

242
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:36,541
The first time I was in high school.

243
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,166
How could you remember me?

244
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,458
You listened to my story and made it up.

245
00:14:46,166 --> 00:14:48,541
By the way, if you're going to woo me,

246
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,333
you need a better story.

247
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,291
I don't know about wooing,

248
00:14:55,666 --> 00:14:58,833
but the way we've met is not normal.

249
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,541
What is it then? Destiny?

250
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,541
What if it really is?

251
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:09,791
I put up with my three ex-boyfriends
because of 'destiny'.

252
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,208
I don't want to hear it anymore.

253
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:13,375
It makes me sick.

254
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:15,041
You may not believe in it...

255
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,750
but I do.

256
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,875
Very well. We'll split up here,

257
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:25,791
and don't try to reconnect.
Don't try to find me.

258
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:28,416
If it's as you said,

259
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,083
we'll surely meet again.

260
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,083
All right.

261
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,375
Are you serious about this?

262
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:36,375
See you soon, Fah.

263
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:38,083
Bye now.

264
00:15:44,625 --> 00:15:45,875
What does that mean?

265
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:49,916
Fah has been gone the whole night.
I can't reach her.

266
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:51,958
And she's not home yet.

267
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,083
Should I be worried?

268
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:55,833
Everything is about Fah.

269
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,375
Why aren't you with her
instead of me?

270
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,458
Hey, be sensible.

271
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,791
If your friend disappeared,
what would you feel, Pai?

272
00:16:06,166 --> 00:16:07,583
Let it be.

273
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,541
Friend, not lover.

274
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:11,833
I'll call you back.

275
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,958
Bas must have called you.

276
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:19,250
So you're here.

277
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:22,041
If you were gone half an hour longer,
I'd call the police.

278
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,250
You turned off the phone.

279
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,166
I didn't, it ran out of battery.

280
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,333
So what time was your flight back?

281
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,583
Hope it wasn't delayed
and you made it to dinner with Pai.

282
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:34,875
We did.

283
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,708
That's good.

284
00:16:37,916 --> 00:16:40,625
Keep her happy.
You don't see each other much.

285
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,125
Let me go get changed.

286
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:46,500
Gotta go to work.

287
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,666
Thank you for caring.

288
00:17:07,625 --> 00:17:10,000
Fah, where will we go on holiday?

289
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,541
What holiday?

290
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:14,083
Those two haven't told you?

291
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:16,375
We've talked about it.

292
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:26,083
I forgot...

293
00:17:26,166 --> 00:17:30,166
Our group plans
to have a long holiday abroad!

294
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:31,833
Pueng told me already.

295
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,041
She said we're stressed out.

296
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:37,166
We work in an airport
but haven't been anywhere.

297
00:17:44,791 --> 00:17:46,375
Still taking some pictures?

298
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,625
Everybody is here.

299
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,666
Better hurry if you want to go.

300
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:52,750
I'm almost there, hold on.

301
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,041
Hey,

302
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,375
the meeting about the holiday, is it here?

303
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,333
Well, well. Whose brother is here?

304
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,500
Oh, are you here for me?

305
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,750
Sit here.

306
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,666
Easy, Bas. This is my brother, Pao.

307
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:13,958
Hello everyone.

308
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:14,875
-Hello.
-Hi.

309
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:16,958
Come here.

310
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,375
You're always late.

311
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,833
Attention seeker.

312
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,458
Well, since everyone is here.

313
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:28,208
Let's vote that we are going to...

314
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,708
Korea!

315
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:30,875
Whoa!

316
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,000
No.

317
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:35,000
We are going to India... Taj Mahal.

318
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,583
Is that right, Beer?

319
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:37,708
Right, Bas?

320
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:39,708
No, sis.

321
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,500
I have changed my mind.

322
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,291
Me too.

323
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,458
We're going to Japan!

324
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:47,875
What?

325
00:18:48,416 --> 00:18:50,000
Why are you 'single' on FB?

326
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:51,750
Because I am.

327
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:53,125
Because of Fah?

328
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:54,833
Nope.

329
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,083
Bye-bye.

330
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,875
What are your routes next month?

331
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,500
Only to Japan.

332
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,583
Someone has to
be responsible for Tae's sorrow.

333
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:15,541
Why?

334
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,291
I want to enjoy onsen!

335
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,166
It's once in a lifetime.

336
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:23,958
Taj Mahal, the monument of love.

337
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,708
Now it's myself and Mek. Two votes.

338
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,625
Who else? Raise your hand.

339
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,250
Who told you I'd go to India?

340
00:19:32,541 --> 00:19:33,541
-What?
-Uh, oh!

341
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:34,791
I don't like roti.

342
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,708
How about Australia?

343
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,208
Don't be so fancy.

344
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,666
Chooose somewhere cheaper.

345
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,083
I have two votes,

346
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,375
plus one from my nephew makes three.

347
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:45,833
So I win.

348
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,125
Everybody must go to Japan with me!

349
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,250
Japan.

350
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,250
Australia.

351
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:53,208
Korea.

352
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,708
I thought you're going to Bali.

353
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:56,791
Damn!

354
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:00,125
Right, let's make it fair.

355
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,500
I have an idea!

356
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,083
Put a magnet at the 'India' slot.

357
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:14,666
When the ball is spun, it will fall there.

358
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,791
-Five hundred.
-I'll do three hundred.

359
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,458
Any country the ball falls into, that's
a public opinion. Our destination. Okay?

360
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Let me throw it.

361
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:43,250
INDIA

362
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,541
JAPAN

363
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:50,708
Japan!

364
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:54,833
-See? Japan.
-I forgot to mention,

365
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,625
the first one is a rehearsal. Bet again!

366

Oh, sakura!

372
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,583
I'll give you 500 to
make it fall into Japan.

373
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,916
Repeat, Japan!

374
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,375
Hello?

375
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:47,041
Where are you guys?

376
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,916
I got here a while ago.
I don't see anyone.

377
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:51,708
Hello?

378
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,625
Beer?

379
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:05,958
Beer?

380
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,000
Is it fun for you?

381
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:16,416
Breaking up relationships?

382
00:22:16,625 --> 00:22:17,750
What are you talking about?

383
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:21,000
You are the reason Pai dumped Tae!

384
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,125
Bas, can you settle with her?
I don't get it.

385
00:22:27,333 --> 00:22:30,541
You're the one I should
settle things with!

386
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:32,666
You did this to Tae.

387
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,500
Don't you feel responsible?

388
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,333
What are you talking about?
I haven't done anything!

389
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,583
Your fault!

390
00:22:39,583 --> 00:22:40,708
Your fault!

391
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:43,125
It's not!

392
00:22:58,833 --> 00:23:02,833
Don't tell me that you also
blame me for the breakup?

393
00:23:03,041 --> 00:23:04,541
If it's not you, who else?

394
00:23:04,958 --> 00:23:06,125
Because of me?

395
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,708
You're bad!

396
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:48,000
Why do you look so calm?

397
00:23:48,208 --> 00:23:50,125
I have something funny.

398
00:23:50,375 --> 00:23:53,500
If it's not, I'll slap you, Pueng.

399
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,875
The hotel we booked

400
00:23:57,583 --> 00:23:58,875
is in Kansai,

401
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
not Sendai.

402
00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,291
Your humor is too far.

403
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,000
Just give me a room key. I'm cold.

404
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:10,416
Sendai and Kansai... sound similar.

405
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:12,541
You booked the hotel in the wrong city!

406
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,250
You let me book when I was drunk.

407
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:15,708
Odds were I'd get it wrong.

408
00:24:16,208 --> 00:24:17,958
Book it yourself next time then!

409
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:22,041
Why haven't you checked in?

410
00:24:22,250 --> 00:24:23,666
Thank goodness!

411
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:25,708
Tae, you're here in time.

412
00:24:25,833 --> 00:24:27,541
Find us a hotel, will you?

413
00:24:31,125 --> 00:24:33,333
It's high season, so many tourists
are in Sendai.

414
00:24:33,541 --> 00:24:34,500
You can hardly find rooms.

415
00:24:34,916 --> 00:24:38,166
Did you tell Bas and Beer
to come to Japan?

416
00:24:38,833 --> 00:24:41,916
No, I thought they wanted me
to go on holiday,

417
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,208
so they arranged
the trip according to my schedule.

418
00:24:45,458 --> 00:24:47,375
They could have told me they want you here

419
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,208
so I didn't have to pay 300
to the waitress.

420
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,291
Three hundred?

421
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,291
Nothing. Let's just find the hotel.

422
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,250
Welcome!

423
00:25:11,416 --> 00:25:13,458
Yeah, we just ended up at your restaurant.

424
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,666
If we can't find a hotel tonight,

425
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,833
I think we should stay in a temple.

426
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:21,333
Temples here don't allow overnight stay.

427
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:24,458
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

428
00:25:24,666 --> 00:25:27,416
That Japanese
sounds like Southern Thai dialect?

429
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,041
I'm not Japanese.

430
00:25:29,416 --> 00:25:30,666
I'm Thai.

431
00:25:30,791 --> 00:25:31,750
Whoa.

432
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,416
Sith.

433
00:25:33,625 --> 00:25:35,083
My friend is also Thai.

434
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,375
Hello.

435
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:40,166
I'm so happy to meet Thai people here.

436
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,791
They have different dialects.

437
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:43,666
Welcome!

438
00:25:44,166 --> 00:25:45,833
Having a good time, huh?

439
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:47,541
I'm busting my ass finding a hotel.

440
00:25:48,125 --> 00:25:50,208
I don't think those guys can find a hotel.

441
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:52,875
Oh well. Tonight...

442
00:25:53,041 --> 00:25:55,125
let's try to get laid with these two.

443
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,458
Then we'll have a place to stay.

444
00:26:01,625 --> 00:26:02,541
At their home.

445
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,333
What do you think?

446
00:26:04,666 --> 00:26:07,458
Try something exotic,
and you'll get hooked.

447
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:10,958
I'll bring you back to Thailand.

448
00:26:11,791 --> 00:26:13,000
That's very funny.

449
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:15,041
They're Thai?

450
00:26:18,333 --> 00:26:21,416
Can you just pretend
that you don't understand?

451
00:26:21,625 --> 00:26:25,250
I understand damn well.

452
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
Hey, coffee!

453
00:26:26,708 --> 00:26:29,541
Four cups, please. The signature ones.

454
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:31,250
How about this ladyboy?

455
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,041
Can he handle hot stuff?

456
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:36,416
He seems to have a bad mouth.

457
00:26:39,541 --> 00:26:43,166
I heard that you're looking for a hotel?

458
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:44,625
Yes, yes, yes.

459
00:26:44,791 --> 00:26:48,375
Do you know anywhere
with four rooms available?

460
00:26:52,916 --> 00:26:53,875
Have some drinks.

461
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:56,000
They are preparing your rooms.

462
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,750
Who found this place?

463
00:27:03,875 --> 00:27:05,833
I have two friends.

464
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,916
We got scholarships at Sendai.

465
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,125
They work in Ryokan.

466
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:13,083
The old man passed away.

467
00:27:13,708 --> 00:27:16,458
His Thai wife is taking care
of the business.

468
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:17,791
She's kind.

469
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:20,791
I'm sure she can help you.

470
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:24,833
Students that work at
Gelato speak Northern and Southern.

471
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,875
They speak Isaan here.

472
00:27:27,291 --> 00:27:28,416
Don't be confused.

473
00:27:28,708 --> 00:27:31,541
They got scholarships
from four regions of Thailand:

474
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,583
North, Northeast, South, and Central.

475
00:27:36,625 --> 00:27:39,250
Lucky for you, the clients didn't show up.

476
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:41,166
We have three rooms available.

477
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:44,291
Plus my son's. He'll give up one room.

478
00:27:44,458 --> 00:27:47,625
-So you have enough.
-Where is your son?

479
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,875
Let me show him my deepest gratitude.

480
00:27:51,416 --> 00:27:53,208
He is arranging the room for you.

481
00:27:53,291 --> 00:27:55,708
Don't worry, his room is not so messy.

482
00:27:56,333 --> 00:27:59,333
He only stays when
he has a night shift here.

483
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,416
Mrs. Ang's son loves reading.

484
00:28:09,625 --> 00:28:12,875
You can read them,
just put them back when you finish.

485
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,708
This drawer is private.

486
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:17,166
He asked not to touch it.

487
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:21,666
Why did you choose this room?

488
00:28:21,875 --> 00:28:24,583
I want to sleep in the same room
as the owner's son.

489
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:27,791
A good-hearted man must be good-looking.

490
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,333
If anything is gone, he'll blame us.

491
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,333
Let me see what's valuable.

492
00:28:33,541 --> 00:28:34,500
Don't mess with it.

493
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,375
I know what he looks like.

494
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,291
Disappointed? He must be ugly, right?

495
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,416
On the contrary...

496
00:28:48,625 --> 00:28:49,500
Look.

497
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:55,333
Hey, he looks familiar.

498
00:28:55,666 --> 00:28:56,791
Like someone I know.

499
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,333
Don't you even try.

500
00:28:58,625 --> 00:29:00,541
I call dibs.

501
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:01,916
This can't be.

502
00:29:02,916 --> 00:29:04,500
It can't be that coincidental.

503
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:10,833
You guys only fail difficult subjects.

504
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:14,916
Me? I can't even pass easy subjects.

505
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:17,458
Difficult or easy, we still failed.

506
00:29:17,666 --> 00:29:19,166
If we don't graduate,

507
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,666
we have to pay everything back.

508
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,833
Do you know how much to pay back?

509
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:26,083
Three times the grant.

510
00:29:26,458 --> 00:29:28,125
It's the consequence
of not focusing on studying

511
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:30,041
and bringing shame to our country.

512
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,375
We spend more time earning
extra money, and what now?

513
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:36,500
If I go back home, my dad will kill me.

514
00:29:37,583 --> 00:29:40,333
Oh... can we rely on black magic?

515
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,708
Black magic?

516
00:29:42,166 --> 00:29:43,250
In Japan?

517
00:30:17,416 --> 00:30:18,375
Hey, Zen.

518
00:30:19,208 --> 00:30:20,583
Is that the girl from the wedding?

519
00:30:22,125 --> 00:30:23,208
I don't think so.

520
00:30:23,416 --> 00:30:25,041
This one seems fine.

521
00:30:26,416 --> 00:30:27,583
Because the one we met

522
00:30:27,666 --> 00:30:30,666
was a drunken thief.

523
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:36,666
I hope you chose my room.

524
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,375
I saw your photo in the room,

525
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,416
and I wished it wasn't you.

526
00:30:45,125 --> 00:30:47,208
But it is you, flesh and blood.

527
00:30:47,875 --> 00:30:50,625
That means you had a peek in my drawer?

528
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,083
What did you steal this time?

529
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:57,166
You must have planned all of this
so I'd end up staying here, right?

530
00:30:57,958 --> 00:30:59,083
I should be the one asking.

531
00:30:59,291 --> 00:31:02,333
What made you end up at my hotel?

532
00:31:03,083 --> 00:31:04,375
I think, maybe...

533
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,416
destiny has started working now.

534
00:31:06,875 --> 00:31:08,333
I know what you're thinking,

535
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:09,958
but stop that thought.

536
00:31:10,416 --> 00:31:12,208
How could you stop my thought?

537
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,416
Last night when I saw you come in,

538
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:15,916
I was a bit shocked.

539
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,416
About what? It's just a coincidence.

540
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:21,833
A coincidence that
you were drunk and I was there.

541
00:31:22,083 --> 00:31:24,083
That you were arrested at the checkpoint.

542
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,416
That we had rice soup together.

543
00:31:26,791 --> 00:31:30,291
That you came here
and couldn't find a hotel.

544
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:35,041
Coincidence that someone brought you here.
That we have spare rooms.

545
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:38,416
And coincidence that I'm the owner.

546
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:40,083
So many coincidences.

547
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:42,416
It's called 'destiny'.

548
00:31:42,625 --> 00:31:45,041
Enough. So corny.

549
00:31:45,541 --> 00:31:47,166
Stop talking nonsense.

550
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:50,250
And don't tell my friends about this,

551
00:31:50,708 --> 00:31:52,250
or I'll hate you.

552
00:31:52,666 --> 00:31:55,875
Fah, where should we eat?

553
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,958
Destiny has brought us together

554
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,125
Who is that guy?

555
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:11,125
I have no idea.

556
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:22,666
We are here... just for
Fah and Tae to get together, right?

557
00:32:22,875 --> 00:32:26,083
But we ran into the destiny nutcase.

558
00:32:26,833 --> 00:32:28,916
If Zen is bound by destiny to Fah,

559
00:32:29,458 --> 00:32:30,916
there is nothing we can do.

560
00:32:31,541 --> 00:32:34,333
Are you saying that
you'll let this happen by destiny?

561
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:35,708
That's right.

562
00:32:36,458 --> 00:32:38,166
Are you taking his side?

563
00:32:38,375 --> 00:32:40,875
No, I just don't want to get between them.

564
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:45,166
But really... whether Fah likes Tae
is totally up to her.

565
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:47,666
It's like we're butting in, Bas?

566
00:32:47,916 --> 00:32:49,291
If you say so.

567
00:32:49,791 --> 00:32:50,875
You know well that

568
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,958
Tae has always liked Fah.

569
00:32:53,416 --> 00:32:55,791
He tried to move on, but he can't.

570
00:32:55,875 --> 00:32:58,458
So Pai left him.

571
00:32:58,958 --> 00:33:00,166
Tae is a good man.

572
00:33:00,375 --> 00:33:02,083
But with Zen, it's destiny.

573
00:33:02,166 --> 00:33:04,708
Pueng, you want to be my enemy?

574
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:08,000
Why do we complicate things?

575
00:33:08,208 --> 00:33:09,791
Let destiny do its job.

576
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,500
Fine, let's bet then.

577
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:14,583
If Tae wins,

578
00:33:14,791 --> 00:33:17,541
you both do whatever we want.

579
00:33:18,333 --> 00:33:19,708
But if Zen wins,

580
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,833
you can tell us to do whatever.

581
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:23,291
I'll do what you told me.

582
00:33:23,833 --> 00:33:25,708
I'll surely win this game!

583
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,958
I'm out. I don't want to bet on it.

584
00:33:28,333 --> 00:33:29,250
You can't.

585
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,916
Teamwork, get it?

586
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,625
What the hell?

587
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,250
What are you up to?

588
00:33:37,666 --> 00:33:40,458
Here, I found it eventually.

589
00:33:40,541 --> 00:33:43,000
I want to change my hairstyle

590
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:46,916
so it looks nice
when I take pictures with Sakura.

591
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,375
Don't worry about your look.

592
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,291
The food is here. Let's have breakfast.

593
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:55,500
Have you eaten?

594
00:33:57,208 --> 00:33:58,125
Look, Pueng...

595
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,708
about Tae and Fah...

596
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:02,583
are they dating?

597
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:04,750
-Who said that?
-Fah.

598
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:17,666
Thank you very much for finding us rooms,

599
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:21,250
and you also took time to show us around.

600
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,333
You're welcome.
I'm glad to be of service.

601
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:28,583
Before we go to see Sakura,

602
00:34:28,666 --> 00:34:31,791
I will take you to upper Sendai,

603
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,750
to the top of Shiogama Shrine.

604
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,916
Why did you tell Zen that we're dating?

605
00:34:36,625 --> 00:34:39,166
I'm afraid he'll be flirty with me.

606
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,708
He seems untrustworthy.

607
00:34:42,166 --> 00:34:43,375
Hope you don't mind.

608
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,041
Of course not.

609
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:49,583
Sakura here blooms in two seasons.

610
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,083
In spring...

611
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,166
Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry.

612
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,458
Come on, Beer.

613
00:34:54,791 --> 00:34:56,458
Let me finish telling the story first.

614
00:34:56,541 --> 00:34:58,500
-Just a second, I'm in a hurry.
-Come on.

615
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,666
You're in a hurry, let me help.

616
00:35:07,125 --> 00:35:08,041
I'm all broken.

617
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:11,000
You're a guide, how could you do this?

618
00:35:11,208 --> 00:35:12,958
Moron! What an asshole!

619
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:25,541
You had it coming.

620
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:29,125
Look! Destiny is working.

621
00:35:32,708 --> 00:35:34,750
You want everyone to know about our dare?

622
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,708
What's wrong with that?

623
00:35:37,041 --> 00:35:38,958
Seems like you are afraid of them knowing.

624
00:35:39,166 --> 00:35:42,625
Or you are afraid
that Tae would be jealous?

625
00:35:42,958 --> 00:35:45,541
Right, I don't want him to know

626
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,666
about the silly game
that can never be true.

627
00:35:48,166 --> 00:35:51,708
But the silly game happens to be true.

628
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:54,833
That's why you're embarrassed
that we met here.

629
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,625
So stop acting like we met before.

630
00:35:59,208 --> 00:36:00,125
What if I don't?

631
00:36:00,750 --> 00:36:04,708
I will make you hate the word "destiny"
like I do right now.

632
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,500
I'm not sure
if you are a photographer or a pervert.

633
00:36:19,333 --> 00:36:20,708
Peeking under the skirt, aren't you?

634
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,750
To get good candid shots,

635
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:28,625
it's like a tiger stalking its prey.

636
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,958
Like soldiers waiting to ambush

637
00:36:31,333 --> 00:36:32,875
without letting the target know.

638
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,541
When it's the right time, shoot!

639
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,875
You think the psychic can really help?

640
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,708
Maybe she can tell us something.

641
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,458
When you were in grade two,

642
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:53,250
you ate a piece of chalk

643
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,958
because you wanted to
write on the board like a teacher.

644
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,500
You had to get your stomach pumped

645
00:36:57,125 --> 00:36:58,875
at the hospital.

646
00:37:00,291 --> 00:37:02,125
You did that shit?

647
00:37:02,416 --> 00:37:03,750
That's a secret.

648
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:05,083
I've never told anyone.

649
00:37:07,708 --> 00:37:08,791
You...

650
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:11,583
had an operation

651
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:13,125
for a hemorrhoid.

652
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:15,125
So many other things to see,

653
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:16,416
why a hemorrhoid?

654
00:37:17,958 --> 00:37:19,458
And this one...

655
00:37:27,208 --> 00:37:28,500
you were an ox in a previous life.

656
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:34,125
Can I know about this life?

657
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:35,708
As a kid

658
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:39,291
you helped your family raise cattle.

659
00:37:39,833 --> 00:37:41,583
As if she could see.

660
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:44,666
Last life you were an ox,
this life you raised them,

661
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:46,791
and you love eating beef?

662
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,791
Why do you like eating your own kind?

663
00:37:49,875 --> 00:37:50,791
Yeah.

664
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:52,708
Your name is Mc.

665
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:54,750
Not Mac, the computer.

666
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:57,833
But Mc Jeans.

667
00:38:00,791 --> 00:38:02,666
I think she'd better dig up something deep

668
00:38:02,916 --> 00:38:04,416
so it's more convincing.

669
00:38:04,916 --> 00:38:07,208
Go away, if you don't believe.

670
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:08,791
Sorry.

671
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:10,833
All of you

672
00:38:11,208 --> 00:38:14,208
want to graduate, right?

673
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,291
Yes, we do.

674
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:19,208
Luckily, I know the way.

675
00:38:19,416 --> 00:38:21,000
Easy to fix.

676
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,583
Please tell us,

677
00:38:23,125 --> 00:38:24,458
we will follow your advice.

678
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:29,083
If you want to graduate,

679
00:38:30,083 --> 00:38:31,500
one of you

680
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:35,083
has to sleep

681
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,250
with a blonde.

682
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:38,625
With a westerner...

683
00:38:39,041 --> 00:38:40,583
Let me do it, okay?

684
00:38:40,916 --> 00:38:42,583
This person will come in ten...

685
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:43,625
Ten days?

686
00:38:44,416 --> 00:38:45,250
Nine

687
00:38:46,083 --> 00:38:46,916
Eight

688
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:48,625
Seven

689
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:50,333
Six

690
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,000
Five

691
00:38:52,583 --> 00:38:53,625
Four

692
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,291
Three

693
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,083
Two

694
00:38:58,083 --> 00:38:59,000
One

695
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,625
Shit!

696
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:07,833
God damn it!

697
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:17,041
How can we tell Tae?

698
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,750
So he can try harder

699
00:39:18,916 --> 00:39:20,916
and get ahead of Zen.

700
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:24,708
If Pueng knows, we'll be disqualified.

701
00:39:24,791 --> 00:39:25,916
She won't know.

702
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,041
Make sure Tae doesn't tell anyone.

703
00:39:34,208 --> 00:39:38,250
I think if what the psychic said was true,

704
00:39:38,791 --> 00:39:41,583
we should just fail the exams.

705
00:39:41,791 --> 00:39:43,208
I can't. If I fail,

706
00:39:43,375 --> 00:39:45,750
my dad will kill me.

707
00:39:49,166 --> 00:39:51,458
What's with Pueng and shopping?

708
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:53,958
Why does Zen take good care of her?

709
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,041
Pueng told me that

710
00:39:56,125 --> 00:39:57,458
she'll make a move on Zen.

711
00:39:57,916 --> 00:40:01,250
She'll get a chance while shopping.

712
00:40:01,333 --> 00:40:02,250
Bit by bit.

713
00:40:02,458 --> 00:40:05,166
Actually,
those two seem good for each other.

714
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,416
One is mental, the other has dot disease.

715
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:09,583
What is dot disease?

716
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,041
"Don't tell anyone" disease.

717
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:15,166
Everything is dot dot dot.

718
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:18,291
They're holding hands now.

719
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,041
How embarassing.

720
00:40:20,125 --> 00:40:21,833
Letting a man hold her hands.

721
00:40:22,458 --> 00:40:23,791
It brings a bad name to Thai girls.

722
00:40:24,250 --> 00:40:26,333
Zen is Thai, not Japanese.

723
00:40:26,708 --> 00:40:29,500
Pop, you want her to lose her
virginity or what?

724
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:32,500
It's just a joke. Why are you mad?

725
00:40:32,583 --> 00:40:33,458
Yeah, why?

726
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,208
Do you have a crush on Zen?

727
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,291
What are you talking about?

728
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,250
No, I don't.

729
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:55,291
You shouldn't have to
prepare food for us, Ang.

730
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,583
Actually, this is not my idea.

731
00:40:57,791 --> 00:40:59,458
Zen wants to cater to you.

732
00:40:59,666 --> 00:41:02,333
He said all of you are nice.

733
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:05,666
Especially you, Fah.

734
00:41:06,083 --> 00:41:07,375
He speaks fondly of you.

735
00:41:07,625 --> 00:41:10,000
Uh-oh, what did he say?

736
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,166
I'd love to hear.

737
00:41:11,833 --> 00:41:13,166
You'd better not hear it.

738
00:41:13,666 --> 00:41:16,958
Just go take a shower
and get ready for the party.

739
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:19,333
The boys should be done by now.

740
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:20,750
What?

741
00:41:20,916 --> 00:41:22,000
Are you kidding?

742
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:24,208
Not only us,

743
00:41:24,541 --> 00:41:27,541
Pop and Pueng also heard it.

744
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:31,250
I think we made it here to Sendai

745
00:41:31,541 --> 00:41:33,208
to stand here shivering.

746
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:35,333
It must be Zen's plan.

747
00:41:35,416 --> 00:41:37,333
We are here in Sendai,

748
00:41:37,416 --> 00:41:40,208
because you guys chose this place?

749
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:42,333
Yeah, I forgot.

750
00:41:42,916 --> 00:41:44,583
But don't underestimate him.

751
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:48,583
If Fah buys the idea of Zen's destiny,

752
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:51,625
your game will be over.

753
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:53,666
Game over? Is it, Beer?

754
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:57,291
I knew that bearded man...

755
00:41:57,375 --> 00:41:59,708
couldn't keep his mouth shut.

756
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,583
He can't keep a simple secret.

757
00:42:01,791 --> 00:42:03,333
Zen didn't spill it.

758
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:06,375
These two overheard you talking to Zen.

759
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:09,750
I didn't mean to intrude.

760
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,416
But once I knew,

761
00:42:11,625 --> 00:42:14,250
I couldn't hold it back.

762
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:18,250
Fah, what do you think about this?

763
00:42:18,458 --> 00:42:19,916
I'll...

764
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,708
make him tired

765
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:25,000
of someone destiny sent to him.

766
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:27,625
I'll start at the party tonight.

767
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,916
Awesome, Fah.

768
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,041
This is a great plan to scare off a rat.

769
00:42:55,458 --> 00:42:57,916
The crazy one up there should be you.

770
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,166
How did you let him take the spotlight?

771
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,583
I didn't.

772
00:43:02,583 --> 00:43:04,083
He drinks faster than me.

773
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,000
Zen, take your brother away.

774
00:43:07,666 --> 00:43:09,875
This has become his welcome party.

775
00:43:10,916 --> 00:43:12,000
Okay, Mom.

776
00:43:16,958 --> 00:43:18,791
-Top...
-What?

777
00:43:18,875 --> 00:43:19,833
Enough.

778
00:43:19,916 --> 00:43:21,291
You'll wake up late tomorrow.

779
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:22,791
Not enough,

780
00:43:22,958 --> 00:43:24,375
I sure can wake up.

781
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:27,083
He has an attitude.
Will this be dangerous?

782
00:43:27,333 --> 00:43:29,208
I apologize about Top.

783
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,750
Top, let's go home.
I'll give you a ride.

784
00:43:32,583 --> 00:43:34,208
No, I'm not going back.

785
00:43:34,750 --> 00:43:36,750
I have something to tell everyone.

786
00:43:37,125 --> 00:43:38,375
Listen carefully.

787
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:42,791
My dream is not to be a hotel staff!

788
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:44,708
He is getting intense.

789
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,041
And what is it that you want to do?

790
00:43:49,416 --> 00:43:51,000
My dream is...

791
00:43:51,125 --> 00:43:53,041
to be a wrestler.

792
00:43:55,541 --> 00:43:56,500
Top, enough. This is embarrassing.

793
00:43:56,583 --> 00:43:57,916
Don't stop him,

794
00:43:58,125 --> 00:43:59,833
just let him do what he wants.

795
00:43:59,916 --> 00:44:02,208
I want to know what he wants to do.

796
00:44:02,416 --> 00:44:03,333
That's not good.

797
00:44:03,416 --> 00:44:04,375
So exciting.

798
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,416
-Zen, stay out of this.
-Top, enough.

799
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,000
Surprise!

800
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,666
I can't be here any longer.

801
00:44:20,166 --> 00:44:23,083
I have to go practice, goodbye!

802
00:44:27,458 --> 00:44:30,666
I hope he stays warm in those clothes.

803
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:33,416
I'll follow him to be sure.

804
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:35,208
Never mind.

805
00:44:35,916 --> 00:44:36,958
He's just going home.

806
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,791
It's always like this when he's drunk.

807
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:40,250
People here are used to it.

808
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:41,500
Hey!

809
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:50,958
You assholes go to bed!

810
00:44:51,375 --> 00:44:54,625
I want to drink with Zen privately.

811
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:57,166
We have some matter to discuss! Whoo!

812
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:02,333
Fah, you are mocking Top so well.

813
00:45:02,750 --> 00:45:04,625
My mom has a good sense of humor.

814
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,000
Keep dancing. More.

815
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:07,708
I never knew you're so funny.

816
00:45:08,333 --> 00:45:10,250
No wonder Zen likes you,

817
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,625
because you're like this.

818
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,458
Good night.

819
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,166
I'm not funny like this at home.

820
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:24,250
Top might not be able
to take you around tomorrow,

821
00:45:24,708 --> 00:45:26,791
so I'll take you myself.

822
00:45:26,916 --> 00:45:27,833
That's great.

823
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,500
Zen, you don't have to.

824
00:45:30,083 --> 00:45:31,958
I have studied the route.

825
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:33,625
I know the way.

826
00:45:33,958 --> 00:45:35,125
We can go on our own tomorrow.

827
00:45:35,583 --> 00:45:37,250
Yeah, we can.

828
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:39,208
We can find toilets and restaurants.

829
00:45:39,375 --> 00:45:41,000
No, we'll get lost.

830
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:44,625
We had a guide today,
but these two ladyboys

831
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:46,416
still got their asses kicked.

832
00:45:46,625 --> 00:45:47,625
There might be a ladyboy hater here.

833
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:50,500
Is there a problem?

834
00:45:50,708 --> 00:45:52,166
-Hey, Bas.
-Yeah, with your mother.

835
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:53,166
All right then.

836
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:56,416
I hope you have a great time tomorrow.

837
00:45:56,625 --> 00:45:59,000
If you have a problem or get lost,

838
00:45:59,916 --> 00:46:01,958
you can call me or the hotel.

839
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:03,750
Good night, everyone.

840
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:08,250
Come on!

841
00:46:08,416 --> 00:46:11,958
Pueng, go to your room. It's late.

842
00:46:12,041 --> 00:46:13,916
Or your pretty face will

843
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,333
get wrinkles.

844
00:46:18,583 --> 00:46:19,666
Bitch!

845
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:39,041
Your friends are not up yet?

846
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,000
They must have stayed up late last night.

847
00:46:49,166 --> 00:46:50,166
What's this?

848
00:46:50,583 --> 00:46:51,625
Ginger tea.

849
00:46:53,041 --> 00:46:55,208
Did you forget that I don't like ginger?

850
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:58,833
I forgot that anything healthy...
isn't your favorite.

851
00:46:59,291 --> 00:47:00,791
I'll get coffee for you then.

852
00:47:01,291 --> 00:47:02,166
No thanks.

853
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:05,208
Just leave me alone.

854
00:47:23,833 --> 00:47:26,000
In real life and in photos,

855
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:27,666
It's totally different.

856
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,625
Where did you learn photography?

857
00:47:30,083 --> 00:47:31,083
From Google.

858
00:47:31,875 --> 00:47:33,416
If Google can teach you this much,

859
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,166
you don't have to go to school.

860
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:38,333
Why do we have to study?

861
00:47:38,583 --> 00:47:41,291
To know technical theories.

862
00:47:41,583 --> 00:47:42,458
That's not true.

863
00:47:42,833 --> 00:47:44,208
Why do we have to study then?

864
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:47,125
One, for your information.

865
00:47:47,333 --> 00:47:50,625
Two, for your consideration.

866
00:47:51,125 --> 00:47:52,125
Lame.

867
00:48:12,833 --> 00:48:14,250
Where is everybody?

868
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:15,625
Off for shopping.

869
00:48:16,375 --> 00:48:17,333
Shopping?

870
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,666
So we're not going inside?

871
00:48:20,208 --> 00:48:21,916
We are. But they went shopping

872
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,666
before the products run out.

873
00:48:24,125 --> 00:48:25,916
Can I run my errands then?

874
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,083
So we can go in together.

875
00:48:27,625 --> 00:48:29,041
You can just go do your thing,

876
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:30,416
and I can go inside by myself.

877
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,291
This is the God of Love.

878
00:48:42,416 --> 00:48:45,041
Young people who are in love

879
00:48:45,375 --> 00:48:47,166
tie a ribbon and make a wish

880
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,666
for a happy love life.

881
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:56,791
You might be curious why he looks angry

882
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:58,708
even though he is the God of Love.

883
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:02,291
That's because

884
00:49:02,666 --> 00:49:05,875
this is his face when he feels ecstatic.

885
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:07,750
No! Nonsense.

886
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:08,708
He said so.

887
00:49:08,916 --> 00:49:11,958
Or you can use a translation program.

888
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:16,500
I'm not a psycho stalker.

889
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,083
So why are you here?

890
00:49:19,583 --> 00:49:21,458
And you came when I'm all alone.

891
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:22,708
Coincidental much?

892
00:49:24,208 --> 00:49:27,250
My Dutch clients

893
00:49:27,625 --> 00:49:29,083
want to make a wish here.

894
00:49:29,625 --> 00:49:30,875
So I took them here.

895
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:35,291
And I met someone
who happens to need an interpreter.

896
00:49:35,916 --> 00:49:36,833
I don't buy it.

897
00:49:38,250 --> 00:49:39,416
Think as you please.

898
00:49:40,833 --> 00:49:44,166
I also don't buy that
you and Tae are together.

899
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:48,625
Why?

900
00:49:49,708 --> 00:49:53,750
Because the hotel staff
have never seen you show affection.

901
00:49:56,125 --> 00:49:57,458
Why are you with him?

902
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,416
I have something to settle with him.

903
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,125
Just send me the GPS location.

904
00:50:01,625 --> 00:50:02,958
Okay, will do.

905
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:07,458
What do you want to eat?

906
00:50:08,875 --> 00:50:09,791
Ramen?

907
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:10,958
Too boring.

908
00:50:11,041 --> 00:50:11,916
Onigiri?

909
00:50:12,125 --> 00:50:13,208
Too many carbs.

910
00:50:13,416 --> 00:50:15,708
-Tonkatsu?
-Deep fried food hurts my throat.

911
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:16,750
Takoyaki?

912
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,083
Not filling.

913
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:19,041
Sushi?

914
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:21,291
I want something more famous.

915
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:22,791
Yakiniku?

916
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:24,750
Too smoky. I don't want to wash my hair.

917
00:50:24,958 --> 00:50:27,333
Just tell me what you want to eat.

918
00:50:28,083 --> 00:50:30,500
I told you, something easy.

919
00:50:31,208 --> 00:50:32,541
Chicken and basil with fried egg.

920
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:34,708
Chicken and basil with fried egg

921
00:50:34,791 --> 00:50:35,708
in Japan?

922
00:50:42,583 --> 00:50:44,458
Let's take this place. My call.

923
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,708
Come on, follow me.

924
00:50:54,625 --> 00:50:56,333
Where has Fah gone?

925
00:50:56,541 --> 00:50:57,708
With Zen.

926
00:50:57,916 --> 00:51:00,375
-Ridiculous.
-Zen took Fah out for a meal.

927
00:51:00,916 --> 00:51:02,041
Look at Tae.

928
00:51:02,541 --> 00:51:03,708
He's so stressed out.

929
00:51:05,458 --> 00:51:07,416
I think it's not fair

930
00:51:08,375 --> 00:51:10,875
that you're judging me based on
your three ex-boyfriends.

931
00:51:11,291 --> 00:51:12,500
And is it fair for me?

932
00:51:12,958 --> 00:51:16,375
I'm in the same old situation
even though I'm tired of it?

933
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:19,708
Why don't we make it fair to both of us?

934
00:51:21,583 --> 00:51:24,083
I'm not asking you
to believe in the same thing.

935
00:51:24,166 --> 00:51:27,833
I just want a chance to prove it

936
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:29,916
in a way that's fair for us.

937
00:51:32,125 --> 00:51:34,291
Can you repeat it again?

938
00:51:34,458 --> 00:51:36,250
I want to know if you understand it.

939
00:51:37,291 --> 00:51:38,958
From tomorrow on,

940
00:51:39,333 --> 00:51:42,458
you'll go to places
in Sendai without telling me.

941
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:46,916
And If I can meet you
by accident like today,

942
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,625
that means we're bound by heart.

943
00:51:49,916 --> 00:51:51,958
And that is destiny.

944
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:56,750
How many times have we accidentally met?

945
00:51:58,375 --> 00:51:59,291
Ten.

946
00:51:59,791 --> 00:52:01,416
But I think that's too many.

947
00:52:02,541 --> 00:52:03,666
How about two?

948
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,083
Two and ten are not close.

949
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:09,791
I'll reduce it...

950
00:52:10,833 --> 00:52:12,541
to seven.

951
00:52:13,958 --> 00:52:15,541
If we meet less than that,

952
00:52:16,291 --> 00:52:20,375
I'll take it that we are not soulmates.

953
00:52:23,125 --> 00:52:25,250
You don't have to prove anything.

954
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:27,708
It doesn't matter.

955
00:52:27,875 --> 00:52:30,250
Since seven times is not possible.

956
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:33,666
I'll make him stop obsessing over destiny.

957
00:52:33,833 --> 00:52:34,833
What if we swap...

958
00:52:35,666 --> 00:52:38,458
if it was Tae, would you do like this?

959
00:52:39,750 --> 00:52:42,541
No way, you'll never hit on me.

960
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:49,291
You have to sacrifice.

961
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,625
Go and force yourself on Bas

962
00:52:50,958 --> 00:52:52,291
and get it over with.

963
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:54,583
Why does it have to be me?

964
00:52:54,916 --> 00:52:56,375
We have an agreement

965
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:58,958
Bas has to be consensual...

966
00:52:59,041 --> 00:53:00,375
and choose one of us.

967
00:53:03,875 --> 00:53:05,541
If I had a nice body like Pop,

968
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:08,333
I wouldn't have to do anything pathetic.

969
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:22,083
That's pathetic, not sexy.

970
00:53:22,333 --> 00:53:25,083
Too pathetic.

971
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:27,791
Philips, why don't you try it?

972
00:53:33,958 --> 00:53:36,166
Hey, that's equally disturbing.

973
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:41,000
So the plan to trick Bas at Onsen
failed then?

974
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:49,916
You're making a travel plan?

975
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,083
You keep looking at the map.

976
00:53:54,916 --> 00:53:57,125
Don't let her know where you are going.

977
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,583
She's like a snake.

978
00:53:58,666 --> 00:54:00,208
She will tell on you.

979
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:05,666
Don't you know

980
00:54:06,208 --> 00:54:07,875
Tae is letting us get around on our own?

981
00:54:08,083 --> 00:54:09,833
No, nobody told me.

982
00:54:09,916 --> 00:54:12,000
But wherever you go, I'll tag along.

983
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:19,125
I'll find a quiet temple
to practice meditation.

984
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:21,708
A temple?

985
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:24,750
Not my thing.

986
00:54:25,458 --> 00:54:27,000
I'll go with the others.

987
00:54:57,041 --> 00:54:58,583
Zen, you haven't told me

988
00:54:58,791 --> 00:55:00,250
why you chose to come here.

989
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,666
I want to see the ocean.

990
00:55:32,791 --> 00:55:36,708
Although Fah is sure that
Zen can't be at the same place,

991
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,083
I won't be careless.

992
00:55:38,791 --> 00:55:39,875
I think so too.

993
00:55:40,125 --> 00:55:42,125
Because how they met here

994
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:44,166
is not just a coincidence.

995
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:55,125
Playing hide and seek?

996
00:55:55,416 --> 00:55:57,250
Will this be a foul play?

997
00:55:58,208 --> 00:56:00,333
I just want to see how you're doing.

998
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:02,208
Why didn't you say hello?

999
00:56:02,458 --> 00:56:04,208
I don't know what to do.

1000
00:56:06,833 --> 00:56:08,375
Haven't you ever had a girlfriend?

1001
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:12,625
It may be because

1002
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:15,083
nobody makes me feel

1003
00:56:15,208 --> 00:56:16,541
like when my dad met my mom.

1004
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:17,708
How?

1005
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,333
My dad is Japanese.

1006
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:20,625
He met my mom in Thailand.

1007
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:23,041
He said the first time he saw her...

1008
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:26,041
there was something
that made him feel like

1009
00:56:26,875 --> 00:56:29,125
she is the one.

1010
00:56:29,625 --> 00:56:30,833
Can I ask you something?

1011
00:56:31,333 --> 00:56:33,166
You must be honest. Don't lie.

1012
00:56:33,541 --> 00:56:36,250
Did you send someone
to spy on where I'm going?

1013
00:56:36,708 --> 00:56:39,208
Nobody has that much time.

1014
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:43,041
To have the hotel staff watch you

1015
00:56:43,458 --> 00:56:44,458
is already more than their duty.

1016
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:47,416
Can I prove it one more time?

1017
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:48,541
All right?

1018
00:57:01,208 --> 00:57:03,708
Hi Fah, you want ice-cream?

1019
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,208
Don't tell Zen or your friends at Ryokan
that I'm here.

1020
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,500
You came here unnoticed,

1021
00:57:10,166 --> 00:57:12,083
like God sent you to represent us.

1022
00:57:12,375 --> 00:57:13,250
Represent what?

1023
00:57:13,458 --> 00:57:16,125
Our message to Bas.

1024
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,291
What do you want to tell him?

1025
00:57:28,458 --> 00:57:29,333
Good evening.

1026
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:35,458
You're glad to see me, I guess.

1027
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:55,708
Looking for souvenirs?

1028
00:57:56,041 --> 00:57:58,666
Yes. We'll go back soon.

1029
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,208
I still can't find souvenirs for the kids.

1030
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:04,125
I saw Fah walking somewhere here.

1031
00:58:04,208 --> 00:58:06,375
I wanted to say hello, but she's gone.

1032
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:15,125
Pop told you, right?

1033
00:58:15,208 --> 00:58:16,208
He did.

1034
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:18,583
All right, I admit you are good.

1035
00:58:19,208 --> 00:58:21,041
But it's not that difficult, is it?

1036
00:58:21,125 --> 00:58:23,291
Everybody comes here in the morning.

1037
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,958
Try another place.

1038
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,625
So I take it that
we met at the last place?

1039
00:58:27,833 --> 00:58:31,750
What time do you want me
to find you again?

1040
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:34,500
Okay.

1041
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:36,208
See you.

1042
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,000
Anything I can help?

1043
00:58:41,291 --> 00:58:42,458
What do you mean?

1044
00:58:44,458 --> 00:58:47,000
Fah told me where she is going today.

1045
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:48,500
I can tell you,

1046
00:58:49,083 --> 00:58:51,791
but you have to keep secret
that it's from me.

1047
00:58:52,916 --> 00:58:54,250
If you do that,

1048
00:58:54,791 --> 00:58:56,625
it's a foul play

1049
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:58,541
and it won't be destiny.

1050
00:58:59,625 --> 00:59:01,125
If you don't talk, I won't.

1051
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:03,083
Who'd know?

1052
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:07,041
Many couples only realize
that they are not soulmates

1053
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:08,666
after they have children.

1054
00:59:09,958 --> 00:59:13,250
So I think destiny doesn't matter
in our lives.

1055
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:15,625
By the afternoon, Fah must be at...

1056
00:59:16,958 --> 00:59:18,041
I don't need you to tell me.

1057
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:24,375
If Fah and I meet seven times,

1058
00:59:24,583 --> 00:59:27,250
you will admit that
Fah and I are made for each other.

1059
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:30,250
And you won't come between us again.

1060
00:59:31,833 --> 00:59:32,708
Can you do it?

1061
00:59:32,916 --> 00:59:35,500
If that's what Fah wants,

1062
00:59:37,208 --> 00:59:39,041
I'll respect that.

1063
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:40,916
But on the contrary,

1064
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:45,083
if you don't make it
to the same places as Fah,

1065
00:59:47,791 --> 00:59:48,666
will you stop?

1066
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:51,000
I always follow the rules.

1067
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:37,916
Only three more places.

1068
01:00:38,708 --> 01:00:40,333
And the sun will set late today.

1069
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,583
I'll see you again. I'm dead sure.

1070
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:45,708
Fine.

1071
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,666
If we meet again,

1072
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:50,583
I'll buy you a meal.

1073
01:01:11,083 --> 01:01:12,125
CHANKO HOTPOT

1074
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:50,125
Welcome!

1075
01:02:05,458 --> 01:02:07,250
Welcome and come inside please.

1076
01:02:10,375 --> 01:02:11,541
Hey, you.

1077
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:18,125
I almost went to the wrong place,

1078
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,875
but I recognized you told me that

1079
01:02:20,958 --> 01:02:23,083
you'd buy me a meal. So I came here

1080
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:24,375
and found you.

1081
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,000
All right, eat up.

1082
01:02:27,083 --> 01:02:28,625
Two glasses of beer.

1083
01:02:29,791 --> 01:02:32,208
Welcome. May I take your order?

1084
01:02:35,291 --> 01:02:37,666
-Draft beer.
-Two draft beers? Okay.

1085
01:02:37,958 --> 01:02:40,541
-Is that all? Okay.
-Thank you.

1086
01:02:40,916 --> 01:02:43,666
And don't get drunk
like when we first met.

1087
01:02:43,750 --> 01:02:46,166
Of course, I can't be drunk.

1088
01:02:46,458 --> 01:02:48,166
I have a mission tomorrow.

1089
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:51,583
I have to go to the most mysterious place

1090
01:02:51,791 --> 01:02:54,000
before I can return as a winner.

1091
01:02:56,541 --> 01:02:57,541
We'll see.

1092
01:03:10,125 --> 01:03:13,416
Let me know if you want to throw up.

1093
01:03:14,208 --> 01:03:15,125
No.

1094
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,500
It's a waste.
I swallowed it.

1095
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:19,416
You're so stingy even with puke.

1096
01:03:21,541 --> 01:03:23,916
Tough people don't throw up.

1097
01:03:34,166 --> 01:03:35,791
Are you out to meet Zen?

1098
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:40,083
I thought this was over.

1099
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:41,875
I saw you celebrate last night.

1100
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:46,416
No, two more places.

1101
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:49,833
But he won't find me this time.

1102
01:03:50,250 --> 01:03:51,500
Only a half day left.

1103
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,541
You want Zen to go to the wrong places?

1104
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:58,208
Come back before the train, okay?

1105
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:14,833
OKAZAKI RYOKAN

1106
01:05:21,583 --> 01:05:22,750
Are there more inside?

1107
01:05:23,083 --> 01:05:24,125
Bring them here.

1108
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:38,000
Are you okay?

1109
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:40,541
Destiny is just a made-up thing.

1110
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,291
I've been played again.

1111
01:06:08,083 --> 01:06:11,000
THREE MONTHS LATER

1112
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,916
King Shah Jahan might have

1113
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:37,125
a too high level of Oxytocin.

1114
01:06:37,208 --> 01:06:40,333
That's why he built the
Taj Mahal in 16 years.

1115
01:06:40,583 --> 01:06:41,958
And Oxytocin is...?

1116
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:46,416
A hormone that makes you feel attached to
someone you live with for a long time.

1117
01:06:47,458 --> 01:06:49,125
Ugh.

1118
01:06:49,708 --> 01:06:50,583
What is it?

1119
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:52,000
I want to go.

1120
01:06:52,083 --> 01:06:53,041
Go then.

1121
01:06:53,208 --> 01:06:54,666
It's just the two of us?

1122
01:06:54,875 --> 01:06:56,916
With a tour group of over forty people.

1123
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:58,458
Why?

1124
01:06:58,708 --> 01:06:59,958
You're afraid
that people will misunderstand?

1125
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:01,541
Something like that.

1126
01:07:01,916 --> 01:07:03,625
I tried to invite your friends,

1127
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,291
but nobody is interested.

1128
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:08,333
Of course,
we've just come back from Japan.

1129
01:07:08,416 --> 01:07:09,625
Who would want to spend more money?

1130
01:07:10,833 --> 01:07:12,250
How about holidays in Thailand?

1131
01:07:12,333 --> 01:07:15,416
I'm sure all your friends will come.

1132
01:07:15,500 --> 01:07:16,875
Where is it?

1133
01:07:17,208 --> 01:07:19,958
There is someone I helped before.

1134
01:07:20,041 --> 01:07:22,291
He wanted to take his family

1135
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:25,541
to a birthday party
in a luxurious hotel in Rayong,

1136
01:07:25,625 --> 01:07:27,916
but his wife got sick

1137
01:07:28,041 --> 01:07:29,500
so he had to cancel everything.

1138
01:07:29,583 --> 01:07:32,083
But the accommodation
and meals are still there.

1139
01:07:35,625 --> 01:07:36,708
Shall we?

1140
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:39,541
About this trip to Rayong...

1141
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:42,166
Tae has paid for everything

1142
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:43,708
so he can ask Fah to marry him.

1143
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:45,791
He wants us to be the witnesses.

1144
01:07:46,375 --> 01:07:48,333
We'll move at eight o'clock.

1145
01:07:48,541 --> 01:07:50,875
After that, there will be some problems

1146
01:07:50,958 --> 01:07:52,916
and we can't go.
So we'll let Fah go first.

1147
01:07:53,125 --> 01:07:55,791
Actually, we leave at six o'clock.

1148
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,708
Whoa, I can't get up that early.

1149
01:07:57,791 --> 01:08:00,625
Come on, you crybaby.

1150
01:08:00,750 --> 01:08:03,458
I saw you carry the luggage in the airport

1151
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:06,041
You can manage even at 3:00 or 4:00 a.m.

1152
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:07,583
And we have to do that for...?

1153
01:08:07,791 --> 01:08:10,166
For Fah to meet Tae,
who's waiting for her.

1154
01:08:10,333 --> 01:08:14,458
And they'll have time to be alone.

1155
01:08:14,791 --> 01:08:18,708
When it's the right time,
Tae will propose.

1156
01:08:18,916 --> 01:08:20,583
And when Fah says yes,

1157
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:23,750
we'll storm in to congratulate them.

1158
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,541
We'll spread the rose petals
all over the place

1159
01:08:26,750 --> 01:08:31,250
and get drunk from dusk till dawn.

1160
01:08:31,583 --> 01:08:32,708
Do you understand?

1161
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:34,791
I almost get it.

1162
01:08:34,875 --> 01:08:38,250
But what excuse
are we going to give to her?

1163
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:39,291
Why do we follow her later?

1164
01:08:41,083 --> 01:08:44,958
I'll tell her that
you hurried to work a morning shift,

1165
01:08:45,083 --> 01:08:48,125
but you dropped some luggage on your foot.

1166
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:51,666
And we'll take care of you, so we're late.

1167
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:53,000
Why me?

1168
01:08:53,083 --> 01:08:54,708
I'm not a careless person.

1169
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:58,708
But you have a careless look.

1170
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:00,458
That's it.

1171
01:09:01,000 --> 01:09:02,625
Tae has invested so much.

1172
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:03,750
Don't be fussy.

1173
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:23,416
Beautiful.

1174
01:09:27,250 --> 01:09:29,458
Yes. All of them.

1175
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:38,333
When will you take a photo
of the one you have a crush on?

1176
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:40,583
Then I can read her personality,

1177
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:42,750
and see if you can bluntly
tell her how you feel?

1178
01:09:44,791 --> 01:09:46,125
I can't.

1179
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:47,833
It might ruin our friendship.

1180
01:09:48,083 --> 01:09:50,583
Even easier as friends.

1181
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:53,458
Really?

1182
01:09:53,750 --> 01:09:54,958
You find the right moment,

1183
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:58,875
look into her eyes, and say...

1184
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,125
"I like you."

1185
01:10:02,708 --> 01:10:03,708
Let's try.

1186
01:10:06,833 --> 01:10:07,791
I like you.

1187
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,958
Yeah, that's it.

1188
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:13,916
-Next time you see her, say it like that.
-Hey, Pao.

1189
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:16,458
I like you.

1190
01:10:18,916 --> 01:10:21,375
In the past three months
that I told you about...

1191
01:10:21,958 --> 01:10:24,416
Hey, I think this beer tastes strange.

1192
01:10:24,916 --> 01:10:26,083
Let me buy a new one.

1193
01:10:26,375 --> 01:10:27,416
Pao.

1194
01:10:31,291 --> 01:10:33,166
I like girls. Okay?

1195
01:10:33,375 --> 01:10:35,250
Why did you get my hopes up?

1196
01:10:35,416 --> 01:10:36,500
What hope?

1197
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,000
I gave you nothing.

1198
01:10:38,416 --> 01:10:40,041
You are my friend, Mek.

1199
01:10:40,208 --> 01:10:41,833
But you took it the wrong way.

1200
01:10:42,541 --> 01:10:44,083
We should be apart for a while.

1201
01:10:54,791 --> 01:10:56,541
No ginger, please.

1202
01:10:56,625 --> 01:10:57,458
Yes.

1203
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:07,083
You don't like ginger?

1204
01:11:08,125 --> 01:11:09,416
I can eat it. I like it.

1205
01:11:09,916 --> 01:11:11,125
What is this?

1206
01:11:11,583 --> 01:11:12,583
Ginger tea.

1207
01:11:13,708 --> 01:11:15,500
Did you forget that I don't like ginger?

1208
01:11:18,041 --> 01:11:19,416
Next time when we meet,

1209
01:11:19,666 --> 01:11:21,291
I'll call you Ginger Man.

1210
01:11:28,875 --> 01:11:31,625
I'm sorry, this one has no ginger.

1211
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:44,041
What's up, Mek?

1212
01:11:44,833 --> 01:11:46,541
Will you drink with me, Fah?

1213
01:11:47,625 --> 01:11:48,750
I'm heartbroken.

1214
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,000
Heartbroken?

1215
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:52,375
When did you have a girlfriend?

1216
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:56,833
Are you fooling yourself and
getting heartbroken?

1217
01:12:00,791 --> 01:12:01,833
What?

1218
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:03,416
You like men?

1219
01:12:06,833 --> 01:12:09,208
Since when are you gay, Mek?

1220
01:12:10,583 --> 01:12:13,125
Our parents will have a heart attack
when they find out.

1221
01:12:15,666 --> 01:12:17,291
Did you just wake up?

1222
01:12:17,375 --> 01:12:18,833
What took you so long?

1223
01:12:19,125 --> 01:12:21,083
Yeah, there was a little accident.

1224
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,625
The luggage fell on Pop's foot,

1225
01:12:23,708 --> 01:12:26,500
so we have to stay and take care of him.

1226
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:29,083
You go ahead, don't wait for us.

1227
01:12:29,291 --> 01:12:31,416
We'll be there around midday.

1228
01:12:32,541 --> 01:12:33,750
Why should I go there first?

1229
01:12:34,541 --> 01:12:37,166
Did you just wake up, or are you drunk?

1230
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,875
I'm a bit drunk.

1231
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,583
I'm drinking with Mek.

1232
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:44,833
Hey, he will go to Rayong too.

1233
01:12:45,541 --> 01:12:47,458
Huh?

1234
01:12:48,041 --> 01:12:50,208
Mek won't go.

1235
01:12:50,291 --> 01:12:52,250
Tell him no. There's not enough room.

1236
01:12:52,333 --> 01:12:55,791
He said he can sleep on the beach.

1237
01:12:56,125 --> 01:12:57,041
Right?

1238
01:13:11,250 --> 01:13:12,958
I can't reach them.

1239
01:13:16,083 --> 01:13:17,333
What are they doing?

1240
01:13:35,875 --> 01:13:36,833
Where are we?

1241
01:13:37,041 --> 01:13:38,875
We'll be in town in about half an hour.

1242
01:13:39,291 --> 01:13:40,750
What time is it now?

1243
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:42,916
Why does it still look early?

1244
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:46,791
Where I come from, it's called evening.

1245
01:13:47,208 --> 01:13:49,000
It's almost 5:00 p.m. now.

1246
01:13:49,291 --> 01:13:50,375
Are we not there yet?

1247
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:52,791
Driver, where are we going?

1248
01:13:53,125 --> 01:13:55,000
-We're going to Ranong.
-What?

1249
01:13:56,083 --> 01:13:57,333
Ranong!

1250
01:14:00,291 --> 01:14:03,458
The driver said Pueng told him "Ranong".

1251
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:05,000
Even the hotel name is Ranong.

1252
01:14:05,208 --> 01:14:07,666
Rayong, I said Rayong. Damned driver!

1253
01:14:07,750 --> 01:14:09,125
You got me into trouble.

1254
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:12,833
If you didn't turn off your phone,
this wouldn't have happened.

1255
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:14,583
Mek told me to.

1256
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:16,083
He said it would disturb his sleep.

1257
01:14:16,333 --> 01:14:17,916
You stay at Ranong tonight,

1258
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:19,625
and come back tomorrow.

1259
01:14:20,250 --> 01:14:21,958
I'll call to book a hotel for you.

1260
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:23,500
Thank you, Tae.

1261
01:14:23,583 --> 01:14:25,458
Then I won't roam around to find a room.

1262
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:28,958
Since I'm here, I'll look around a bit

1263
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:30,291
so Mek can feel better.

1264
01:14:30,791 --> 01:14:34,291
Have a great time in Rayong, guys.

1265
01:14:34,583 --> 01:14:35,625
Bye.

1266
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:40,125
Come on, nobody blames you.

1267
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:47,416
I am not good with young people's lingo.

1268
01:14:47,875 --> 01:14:49,916
Once I was asked to drive to Chiang Rai,

1269
01:14:50,125 --> 01:14:51,500
and I heard Chiang Khan.

1270
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:53,333
To Nokhon Chai Sri,

1271
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:56,083
I heard Nakhon Sri Thammarat.

1272
01:14:56,166 --> 01:14:59,166
That's why my life is a mess.

1273
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:02,333
But he shouldn't make me
think he likes me.

1274
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:04,958
It was that obvious, and he said no.

1275
01:15:05,250 --> 01:15:07,291
My gaydar is always correct.

1276
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,416
He lied to me.

1277
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:10,166
He didn't.

1278
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:12,208
My ears are bad.

1279
01:15:13,166 --> 01:15:14,541
Don't blame the customers.

1280
01:15:15,208 --> 01:15:18,083
May I show you the bill?

1281
01:15:18,666 --> 01:15:20,083
I haven't asked for it.

1282
01:15:20,166 --> 01:15:21,916
Just for your information.

1283
01:15:23,458 --> 01:15:24,666
Sixty-four thousand!

1284
01:15:25,916 --> 01:15:27,833
A fine? Two thousand baht fine!

1285
01:15:27,916 --> 01:15:28,958
What fine?

1286
01:15:29,041 --> 01:15:31,916
Our restaurant is at a public park,

1287
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:34,208
where drinking alcohol is not allowed.
But those two...

1288
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,583
Don't panic.

1289
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,083
We have this problem very often,

1290
01:15:42,166 --> 01:15:44,375
so we have a special
service to reduce the bill.

1291
01:15:45,000 --> 01:15:46,083
What service?

1292
01:15:54,041 --> 01:15:56,166
If Fah realizes that it's you guys' plan,

1293
01:15:56,541 --> 01:15:57,625
you'll be in trouble.

1294
01:15:57,833 --> 01:15:59,333
Just don't tell her.

1295
01:15:59,416 --> 01:16:01,625
Play pranks on people sometimes.
Life is fun.

1296
01:16:12,291 --> 01:16:14,625
Here's the bill for the food and the fine.

1297
01:16:15,583 --> 01:16:16,416
Thank you.

1298
01:16:16,791 --> 01:16:18,291
They eat a lot, don't they?

1299
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:21,958
-Here.
-Yes.

1300
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:25,166
Tell that girl that she dances really well

1301
01:16:25,416 --> 01:16:26,333
so the restaurant doesn't charge her.

1302
01:16:26,875 --> 01:16:28,000
You know how to prank people.

1303
01:16:43,250 --> 01:16:45,458
Don't you want to say hello to her?

1304
01:16:46,208 --> 01:16:49,458
Yeah, meeting like this
is not a coincidence.

1305
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:53,708
Mek,

1306
01:16:54,625 --> 01:16:55,625
come on.

1307
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:59,250
Now. Get up. Get up.

1308
01:17:01,375 --> 01:17:02,291
Go.

1309
01:17:19,666 --> 01:17:22,000
I'm about to go to the morning market.

1310
01:17:23,291 --> 01:17:25,583
Mek? He's not up yet.

1311
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:28,666
Let him rot in the hotel.

1312
01:17:30,625 --> 01:17:33,291
Sure, if I see something interesting,

1313
01:17:33,583 --> 01:17:34,708
I'll call you.

1314
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:36,375
Yes. Bye-bye.

1315
01:17:59,416 --> 01:18:00,291
Stop!

1316
01:18:10,458 --> 01:18:12,916
This dancing creature...
is it a human or a spirit?

1317
01:18:15,416 --> 01:18:17,416
This is not in the game plan.

1318
01:18:17,708 --> 01:18:19,000
How do you end up here?

1319
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:22,541
I'm looking into Ranong mineral water.

1320
01:18:22,750 --> 01:18:24,625
Cooperation between me and Sendai Mining.

1321
01:18:25,291 --> 01:18:26,291
How about you?

1322
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:27,916
You're here for holidays with Mek?

1323
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:30,416
How do you know I'm with Mek?

1324
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,000
Random guess.

1325
01:18:36,291 --> 01:18:37,375
Who are you with?

1326
01:18:38,375 --> 01:18:40,458
With the four boys.

1327
01:18:41,166 --> 01:18:42,541
Ae is from here,

1328
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:44,666
so he volunteers as a guide.

1329
01:18:45,083 --> 01:18:46,791
The three of them
are here for their holidays.

1330
01:18:47,208 --> 01:18:49,416
They went to thank Bas

1331
01:18:49,958 --> 01:18:51,750
for helping them graduate.

1332
01:18:52,833 --> 01:18:54,041
Bas?

1333
01:18:54,583 --> 01:18:55,416
How?

1334
01:18:56,958 --> 01:18:59,666
Well, now tell me

1335
01:19:00,458 --> 01:19:01,833
why you want me.

1336
01:19:01,916 --> 01:19:03,750
-Or...
-we want to graduate.

1337
01:19:03,875 --> 01:19:04,791
What?

1338
01:19:05,166 --> 01:19:06,208
The psychic told us

1339
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:09,541
that one of us had to sleep with you

1340
01:19:09,666 --> 01:19:10,666
so we will graduate.

1341
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:14,166
Now we are here, so just choose one.

1342
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,833
Just get it over with.

1343
01:19:16,416 --> 01:19:17,291
Fine.

1344
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,416
You want to graduate?

1345
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:21,416
I choose all of you.

1346
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,958
Don't be shy,

1347
01:19:24,666 --> 01:19:26,041
you're ready, right?

1348
01:19:26,250 --> 01:19:28,208
Bend over slowly.

1349
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:30,958
Now.

1350
01:19:32,041 --> 01:19:33,875
Bow a little more.

1351
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:36,833
Perfect position.

1352
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:43,000
Take that! Take that!

1353
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:46,083
If sleeping with me
makes people pass exams,

1354
01:19:46,166 --> 01:19:47,916
I would have a PhD by now.

1355
01:19:48,916 --> 01:19:49,833
You want to pass the exam?

1356
01:19:49,916 --> 01:19:50,750
Yes.

1357
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,000
Bring your books.

1358
01:19:52,083 --> 01:19:55,458
If you read but don't remember,
I'll hit you.

1359
01:19:57,208 --> 01:19:58,250
Damn kids.

1360
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,125
This hot spring is natural.

1361
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,708
This largest one is the main one.

1362
01:20:05,916 --> 01:20:07,083
Why did you bring eggs?

1363
01:20:07,708 --> 01:20:09,333
To make soft-boiled eggs.

1364
01:20:09,625 --> 01:20:12,541
Even his eggs can be cooked,
so why wouldn't our balls be?

1365
01:20:13,250 --> 01:20:16,250
The hot bath and
the hot spring are different.

1366
01:20:20,250 --> 01:20:22,541
Do we have boat tickets to
Koh Payam for everyone?

1367
01:20:22,958 --> 01:20:24,875
What? Only two?

1368
01:20:25,083 --> 01:20:26,708
We have booked in advance!

1369
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,125
We only have two tickets to Koh Payam.

1370
01:20:31,875 --> 01:20:33,500
You and Fah should go ahead.

1371
01:20:33,708 --> 01:20:36,125
It's easy to get around on the island.

1372
01:20:36,416 --> 01:20:38,250
The boat is arriving soon.

1373
01:20:39,083 --> 01:20:40,083
Hurry up.

1374
01:20:48,041 --> 01:20:50,208
When it snows in Sendai, it's very cold.

1375
01:20:50,833 --> 01:20:52,208
Unlike here.

1376
01:20:53,041 --> 01:20:56,041
If I faint, don't be mad.

1377
01:20:57,875 --> 01:20:59,208
How could it not be hot,

1378
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:01,833
your clothing doesn't match the weather.

1379
01:21:04,833 --> 01:21:06,375
The world is getting hotter.

1380
01:21:07,166 --> 01:21:08,750
Or is Thailand always this hot?

1381
01:21:09,875 --> 01:21:13,708
When I was a kid,
it was still cold this month.

1382
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:18,625
Let's find a drink.

1383
01:21:23,041 --> 01:21:24,666
How is it?

1384
01:21:24,875 --> 01:21:27,000
Is it cooler now, Japanese boy?

1385
01:21:27,458 --> 01:21:28,791
What are you doing? Fine.

1386
01:21:28,875 --> 01:21:30,125
Wait. I'll get wet.

1387
01:21:30,458 --> 01:21:32,291
Hey, I'll get wet.

1388
01:21:32,375 --> 01:21:33,208
I'll get wet. No. No.

1389
01:21:33,625 --> 01:21:34,500
You have to.

1390
01:21:34,583 --> 01:21:36,125
What are you doing?

1391
01:21:36,208 --> 01:21:37,416
From Bangkok, huh?

1392
01:21:37,666 --> 01:21:38,875
This is inappropriate.

1393
01:21:39,333 --> 01:21:41,083
Do you know where the water is from?

1394
01:21:41,375 --> 01:21:42,625
From the tap?

1395
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:43,708
No.

1396
01:21:43,791 --> 01:21:46,208
From there,
the reservoir that the king gave us.

1397
01:21:46,625 --> 01:21:48,583
People here know the value of water.

1398
01:21:48,958 --> 01:21:50,875
It's very difficult during the dry season.

1399
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:57,041
What now?
You always think about bullying others.

1400
01:21:57,541 --> 01:21:59,166
Yeah, you saint!

1401
01:21:59,375 --> 01:22:01,333
You never bullied anyone in your life?

1402
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,541
Not that I remember.

1403
01:22:03,625 --> 01:22:05,833
Only teasing at most.

1404
01:22:06,333 --> 01:22:07,250
From now on,

1405
01:22:07,541 --> 01:22:10,083
you can bully me. I allow you.

1406
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:11,083
Why bully?

1407
01:22:11,291 --> 01:22:14,125
Well, your life will be more colorful,

1408
01:22:14,458 --> 01:22:16,666
not so bland like it is now.

1409
01:22:36,041 --> 01:22:36,958
Look at this.

1410
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:40,041
A heart-shaped rock.

1411
01:22:40,208 --> 01:22:41,250
Like in Sendai.

1412
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,541
What heart? I can't see.

1413
01:22:45,875 --> 01:22:47,666
Here. Look at this.

1414
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,625
Here, do my hands look like it?

1415
01:22:53,166 --> 01:22:54,250
Ding!

1416
01:22:55,125 --> 01:22:55,958
Heartbeats.

1417
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:57,583
Beep. Beep.

1418
01:22:57,666 --> 01:22:59,916
Beep. Beep. Double. Beep beep.

1419
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:01,791
An upside down heart.

1420
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:05,375
For one with a change of heart?

1421
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:10,083
On the day that we bet,

1422
01:23:10,166 --> 01:23:13,416
I went to the heart-shaped rock.
Where did you go?

1423
01:23:15,291 --> 01:23:16,666
I went to the fox park.

1424
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:20,916
I thought a fox like you
would go visit your friends.

1425
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:24,458
So you lost.

1426
01:23:51,041 --> 01:23:53,000
If we guess what's in each other's minds,

1427
01:23:53,375 --> 01:23:54,833
you'd score more points.

1428
01:23:55,583 --> 01:23:57,375
Because we're staying
at the same hotel, right?

1429
01:23:58,791 --> 01:23:59,625
Correct.

1430
01:24:06,375 --> 01:24:07,458
I'll go to my room now.

1431
01:24:10,416 --> 01:24:11,541
Are you all right?

1432
01:24:29,083 --> 01:24:30,208
Fah!

1433
01:24:39,708 --> 01:24:41,208
You met Zen here,

1434
01:24:43,916 --> 01:24:45,791
and I'm starting to believe in destiny.

1435
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:53,166
Do you have any idea
why I invited you to Rayong?

1436
01:24:53,833 --> 01:24:55,458
Is there a hidden agenda?

1437
01:24:57,541 --> 01:24:58,833
I was gonna propose to you.

1438
01:25:05,291 --> 01:25:07,166
Will it really be okay for us?

1439
01:25:07,250 --> 01:25:08,250
To be together?

1440
01:25:10,625 --> 01:25:12,541
If we were in Rayong,

1441
01:25:13,625 --> 01:25:15,291
I can really say yes.

1442
01:25:16,750 --> 01:25:18,333
But I am not sure now.

1443
01:25:19,375 --> 01:25:21,541
Can I have another chance, Tae?

1444
01:25:22,958 --> 01:25:24,958
If the answer is still you,

1445
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:29,000
I will then be confident
about us... please?

1446
01:25:43,291 --> 01:25:46,083
Excuse me.
Can you call room 341?

1447
01:25:48,333 --> 01:25:50,458
I'm sorry. The client has checked out.

1448
01:25:50,541 --> 01:25:53,458
-Checked out?
-Yes, he left in the early morning.

1449
01:26:10,250 --> 01:26:11,750
THREE MONTHS LATER

1450
01:26:12,208 --> 01:26:13,416
Hello.

1451
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:15,875
Yes, I booked a table for ten.

1452
01:26:16,458 --> 01:26:17,791
Inside, please. The second table.

1453
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,791
There are your parents, and the rest?

1454
01:26:20,875 --> 01:26:22,083
Why did you book for so many?

1455
01:26:22,416 --> 01:26:24,791
Only relatives and my mom's friend.

1456
01:26:25,833 --> 01:26:28,333
They want to see the in-laws.

1457
01:26:31,916 --> 01:26:33,500
Is this Sompong's?

1458
01:26:33,583 --> 01:26:36,291
No, I'm Tuk's son.

1459
01:26:39,291 --> 01:26:41,625
What name did you book the table under?

1460
01:26:42,041 --> 01:26:45,041
Sompong booked it, so I go by that name.

1461
01:26:45,208 --> 01:26:46,625
For the rotating saving group,

1462
01:26:46,708 --> 01:26:48,208
we go by the one who booked the table.

1463
01:26:50,208 --> 01:26:51,083
Rotating saving group?

1464
01:26:53,416 --> 01:26:54,541
Let me call my mom.

1465
01:26:56,666 --> 01:26:59,375
Can you help me
create a photo album on Line?

1466
01:26:59,875 --> 01:27:01,250
These photos.

1467
01:27:02,666 --> 01:27:03,625
Yes.

1468
01:27:05,250 --> 01:27:08,000
Oops, you went to Sendai?

1469
01:27:08,083 --> 01:27:09,000
Yes.

1470
01:27:09,208 --> 01:27:10,375
Have you been there?

1471
01:27:11,583 --> 01:27:15,250
-I have.
-You know, I almost became disabled.

1472
01:27:15,458 --> 01:27:16,916
I fell over there.

1473
01:27:17,125 --> 01:27:19,291
Luckily someone caught me,

1474
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:21,416
and it was a Thai man.

1475
01:27:23,625 --> 01:27:25,625
I was told the exact location.

1476
01:27:25,833 --> 01:27:26,958
So embarrassing.

1477
01:27:27,125 --> 01:27:28,666
Tae, wait here a moment.

1478
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:30,916
I have something to ask that lady.

1479
01:27:32,541 --> 01:27:33,750
What is it?

1480
01:27:36,625 --> 01:27:39,833
I've just realized that
the day I bet with Zen,

1481
01:27:40,041 --> 01:27:41,541
he went to the heart-shaped rock as well.

1482
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:43,333
You fell at the heart-shaped rock?

1483
01:27:47,833 --> 01:27:49,541
Are you OK?

1484
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:54,125
It hurts.

1485
01:27:54,208 --> 01:27:55,208
Are you Thai?

1486
01:27:55,541 --> 01:27:58,083
After he helped me, he hurried back.

1487
01:27:58,291 --> 01:28:01,041
Said he had an appointment
with someone at noon.

1488
01:28:01,166 --> 01:28:02,208
I didn't know what was wrong.

1489
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:06,625
When he is excited
or uses too much strength, he faints.

1490
01:28:06,708 --> 01:28:09,208
The staff took him to the hospital.

1491
01:28:09,750 --> 01:28:12,958
Seriously, are there photos or anything

1492
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:15,041
to prove that it's Zen?

1493
01:28:18,083 --> 01:28:19,583
And if it was really him,

1494
01:28:20,125 --> 01:28:23,125
Why did he lie
to you that he didn't go there?

1495
01:28:23,625 --> 01:28:25,625
He must have wanted to reject you

1496
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:26,708
so he took that chance.

1497
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:28,750
What are you talking about?

1498
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:31,333
There is no beer on the table.

1499
01:28:31,750 --> 01:28:34,333
Pueng, get some beer. I'm thirsty.

1500
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:36,250
Here's yours.

1501
01:28:41,541 --> 01:28:42,958
I was about to close the shop

1502
01:28:43,791 --> 01:28:45,833
and Tae turned up like a ghost.

1503
01:28:45,958 --> 01:28:49,416
He said he found it in Japan
and realized that you want it.

1504
01:28:49,625 --> 01:28:53,416
He bought you sweets.
So romantic.

1505
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:55,125
I asked him to.

1506
01:28:55,250 --> 01:28:57,083
It's my mom's birthday present.

1507
01:28:57,958 --> 01:28:58,875
He might have forgotten.

1508
01:29:00,041 --> 01:29:02,916
But I got them from someone else already.

1509
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:11,458
Your mom likes sweets?

1510
01:29:11,666 --> 01:29:12,791
She collects them.

1511
01:29:12,916 --> 01:29:14,375
How strange.

1512
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:15,666
Hey.

1513
01:29:15,750 --> 01:29:16,791
I remember now.

1514
01:29:17,291 --> 01:29:19,750
On the day that you were drunk
and wrecked the wedding,

1515
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:21,916
I called Tae to come to help,

1516
01:29:22,208 --> 01:29:24,458
and he told me to say
that the gift was for Mom.

1517
01:29:25,291 --> 01:29:26,666
Then he went in.

1518
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:28,291
It was to trick you to go home,

1519
01:29:28,375 --> 01:29:29,541
but he lost it.

1520
01:29:29,875 --> 01:29:30,958
This is not mine.

1521
01:29:31,333 --> 01:29:32,458
I've been looking for the owner.

1522
01:29:32,875 --> 01:29:35,208
But Tae was looking for you.

1523
01:29:35,291 --> 01:29:38,208
He lost the present,
and couldn't find you,

1524
01:29:38,625 --> 01:29:40,416
and Pai dumped him

1525
01:29:40,791 --> 01:29:42,291
because he didn't turn up for the date.

1526
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:53,500
But he has a reason for not telling you.

1527
01:29:57,500 --> 01:29:58,791
How do you know?

1528
01:29:59,458 --> 01:30:00,458
At Ranong,

1529
01:30:02,458 --> 01:30:03,708
Zen told me.

1530
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:05,375
On the day we bet,

1531
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:08,333
I went to the same place as Fah.

1532
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:10,833
I went to the heart-shaped rock.

1533
01:30:11,500 --> 01:30:12,708
Why are you telling me this?

1534
01:30:14,875 --> 01:30:16,041
Me telling you this...

1535
01:30:17,541 --> 01:30:19,791
doesn't mean that I am asking
for her back.

1536
01:30:20,666 --> 01:30:23,208
But I want you to know I lost that game

1537
01:30:24,250 --> 01:30:25,458
because I had to.

1538
01:30:28,625 --> 01:30:29,708
Why?

1539
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:36,291
I have a problem that is wrecking my life.

1540
01:30:38,083 --> 01:30:40,708
If she chose me,
her life would be full of sadness.

1541
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:43,541
She would never find happiness,

1542
01:30:44,125 --> 01:30:45,875
and I don't want her to be like that.

1543
01:30:46,500 --> 01:30:48,750
I believe there will be no one

1544
01:30:50,416 --> 01:30:51,625
who takes better care of her than you.

1545
01:30:55,625 --> 01:30:56,583
Idiots.

1546
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:58,916
You both are idiots.

1547
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:00,791
I'm selfish.

1548
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,416
I didn't want to tell you.

1549
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,500
I didn't want to lose you to him.

1550
01:31:19,333 --> 01:31:20,875
SENEN RIFU HOSPITAL

1551
01:31:52,166 --> 01:31:54,208
His condition is getting worse.

1552
01:31:54,333 --> 01:31:56,791
He's been unconscious for five days now.

1553
01:31:57,166 --> 01:31:59,625
There will be a chance
that he'll wake up again, right?

1554
01:32:00,833 --> 01:32:03,250
I hope for a miracle.

1555
01:32:04,708 --> 01:32:06,791
Like in the last minute,

1556
01:32:06,875 --> 01:32:09,541
we could find a stem cell donor for him.

1557
01:32:09,833 --> 01:32:13,708
We have been looking for years,
and still haven't found anyone.

1558
01:32:14,333 --> 01:32:16,750
Zen, you have to be patient.

1559
01:32:18,041 --> 01:32:21,166
There must be a match for you.

1560
01:32:21,375 --> 01:32:24,833
We are soulmates. We get to be together.

1561
01:32:26,583 --> 01:32:30,083
I didn't think anyone
could make me believe in destiny.

1562
01:32:30,625 --> 01:32:32,458
But you can.

1563
01:32:36,041 --> 01:32:37,916
So you have to wake up

1564
01:32:38,375 --> 01:32:40,791
and take responsibility for what you did.

1565
01:32:46,166 --> 01:32:47,166
Did you know

1566
01:32:47,833 --> 01:32:51,416
you made me believe in love again?

1567
01:32:52,833 --> 01:32:55,541
You made me fall in love again, Zen.

1568
01:32:58,041 --> 01:33:00,083
So please... can you wake up?

1569
01:33:00,291 --> 01:33:01,375
Please, Zen.

1570
01:33:22,625 --> 01:33:24,500
He recorded this

1571
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:28,166
and told me that when
you come back to Sendai,

1572
01:33:28,250 --> 01:33:29,458
I should give it to you.

1573
01:33:36,416 --> 01:33:38,666
When I sit here drinking ginger tea,

1574
01:33:40,083 --> 01:33:41,625
I always think of a woman

1575
01:33:43,041 --> 01:33:44,875
who declared herself an enemy of ginger

1576
01:33:45,833 --> 01:33:47,291
but a friend of beer.

1577
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:52,208
Actually,
I think she is not good at drinking.

1578
01:33:53,375 --> 01:33:55,750
Just sniffing it, she can get drunk.

1579
01:33:57,541 --> 01:33:58,750
So today,

1580
01:33:58,958 --> 01:34:02,500
I want to invite that woman
who doesn't eat ginger

1581
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:05,583
to listen to the benefits of ginger

1582
01:34:06,041 --> 01:34:07,041
right now.

1583
01:34:08,875 --> 01:34:12,750
If you feel bloated or gassy,

1584
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:17,083
drinking ginger tea
or eating fresh ginger

1585
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:19,416
makes you feel better.

1586
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:24,375
Furthermore, it cures car sickness

1587
01:34:26,125 --> 01:34:27,583
and nausea.

1588
01:34:34,833 --> 01:34:35,833
I'm sorry, Fah.

1589
01:34:41,416 --> 01:34:42,625
I don't talk sweet,

1590
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:48,958
but I really care about you.

1591
01:34:51,875 --> 01:34:52,875
Goodbye.

1592
01:35:03,958 --> 01:35:06,791
THREE MONTHS LATER

1593
01:35:08,041 --> 01:35:09,083
Here it is.

1594
01:35:09,458 --> 01:35:11,875
-Thank you.
-Please come again.

1595
01:35:11,958 --> 01:35:12,791
Have a nice flight.

1596
01:35:13,000 --> 01:35:14,041
She works so hard

1597
01:35:14,125 --> 01:35:16,625
that she became
the best employee three months in a row.

1598
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:19,208
Have you heard of

1599
01:35:19,875 --> 01:35:21,833
''putting on a brave face''?

1600
01:35:22,791 --> 01:35:23,625
Yes.

1601
01:35:24,083 --> 01:35:25,916
Let me know if you need help.

1602
01:35:30,416 --> 01:35:31,500
Where do I pay?

1603
01:35:35,791 --> 01:35:37,875
I hope for a miracle.

1604
01:35:38,291 --> 01:35:40,333
Like in the last minute,

1605
01:35:40,416 --> 01:35:42,916
we could find a stem cell donor for him.

1606
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:47,958
Hello, Mek. What's up?
I'm in Japan.

1607
01:35:48,083 --> 01:35:51,875
Mom cleaned up the house and she
found a letter from the Red Cross to you.

1608
01:35:52,208 --> 01:35:54,458
I thought it could be
important, so I opened it.

1609
01:35:54,666 --> 01:35:57,250
Is it what I hope it is?

1610
01:35:57,875 --> 01:35:59,916
The letter said something like...

1611
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:04,250
your are a match with a patient.

1612
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:08,583
What is the result
of my parents' health check-up?

1613
01:36:08,833 --> 01:36:11,750
Your family history has high
potential for diabetes and hypertension.

1614
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:14,000
I don't want my children to risk it.

1615
01:36:22,625 --> 01:36:24,291
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

1616
01:36:28,708 --> 01:36:29,708
Excuse me.

1617
01:36:30,416 --> 01:36:32,791
Have we met before?

1618
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:37,875
Of course. We are...

1619
01:36:38,083 --> 01:36:39,666
Zen is conscious.

1620
01:36:40,666 --> 01:36:42,250
But he still can't remember anything.

1621
01:36:43,166 --> 01:36:45,541
The doctor said it will take a while.

1622
01:36:47,041 --> 01:36:47,916
Zen,

1623
01:36:49,083 --> 01:36:50,333
this is Fah.

1624
01:36:50,750 --> 01:36:55,541
The Fah you said destiny sent to you.

1625
01:36:56,625 --> 01:36:57,625
I'm sorry.

1626
01:36:59,958 --> 01:37:01,041
I really can't remember you.

1627
01:37:01,541 --> 01:37:03,208
We met at the wedding.

1628
01:37:04,166 --> 01:37:07,625
I was so drunk,
and I was arrested for drunk driving.

1629
01:37:08,291 --> 01:37:09,625
And you helped me.

1630
01:37:09,833 --> 01:37:12,291
Then we had rice soup.

1631
01:37:12,791 --> 01:37:16,208
You like ginger but I don't.

1632
01:37:17,166 --> 01:37:19,583
Then I...

1633
01:37:23,625 --> 01:37:26,208
Maybe we have really met,

1634
01:37:27,375 --> 01:37:29,583
but I've just recovered from
a medical condition.

1635
01:37:29,791 --> 01:37:31,666
I don't want to think too much.

1636
01:37:33,208 --> 01:37:35,916
Can you please proceed with the payment?
I'm in a hurry.

1637
01:37:38,916 --> 01:37:39,875
Yes.

1638
01:37:40,166 --> 01:37:41,125
Thank you.

1639
01:37:47,416 --> 01:37:49,458
Hey. Isn't that Zen?

1640
01:37:49,666 --> 01:37:51,458
He doesn't remember me.

1641
01:37:53,750 --> 01:37:58,333
Why? I haven't proven anything so far?

1642
01:37:59,166 --> 01:38:00,833
What else do I have to do?

1643
01:38:21,875 --> 01:38:23,416
Have you finished work?

1644
01:38:27,958 --> 01:38:29,000
Do you want rice soup?

1645
01:38:30,458 --> 01:38:31,291
What?

1646
01:38:32,291 --> 01:38:35,000
I saw that there is
a rice soup restaurant in the airport.

1647
01:38:35,208 --> 01:38:36,583
I want to invite you to join me.

1648
01:38:37,041 --> 01:38:39,875
I want to know if it is as good as...

1649
01:38:40,125 --> 01:38:41,750
the place you took me to.

1650
01:38:42,750 --> 01:38:44,083
You remember me now?

1651
01:38:45,791 --> 01:38:47,375
A rare woman like you,

1652
01:38:48,958 --> 01:38:49,875
I won't forget so easily.

1653
01:38:50,375 --> 01:38:52,000
But I just talked to your mom.

1654
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,375
She told me you can't remember
anything in the past year.

1655
01:38:55,875 --> 01:38:58,958
"You just need to give him
some time, Fah."

1656
01:38:59,625 --> 01:39:00,666
My mom said that, right?

1657
01:39:03,708 --> 01:39:05,291
I wrote a script for her.

1658
01:39:09,583 --> 01:39:10,583
Whoa, sneaky!

1659
01:39:10,666 --> 01:39:12,291
-My mom?
-You are, moron!

1660
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:14,125
Why did you do this?

1661
01:39:14,458 --> 01:39:16,791
You have fun while another is suffering.

1662
01:39:17,541 --> 01:39:19,791
Wasn't it you who asked me

1663
01:39:19,875 --> 01:39:22,458
if I have ever bullied anyone in my life?

1664
01:39:22,916 --> 01:39:24,500
Here, this life...

1665
01:39:25,291 --> 01:39:26,291
once.

1666
01:39:28,541 --> 01:39:29,833
Just this one time.

1667
01:39:30,458 --> 01:39:31,666
So do you want rice soup?

1668
01:39:32,333 --> 01:39:33,375
No.

1669
01:39:34,083 --> 01:39:36,000
But the toppings are really good
at this place.

1670
01:39:40,541 --> 01:39:41,500
Okay.

1671
01:39:47,416 --> 01:39:49,375
They said the ginger is good here too.

1672
01:39:54,333 --> 01:39:55,333
Dad.

1673
01:39:55,583 --> 01:39:58,875
This is the girl I told you about
so often.

1674
01:40:02,458 --> 01:40:04,250
She saved my life.

1675
01:40:07,166 --> 01:40:10,708
Tell your dad about our destiny too.

1676
01:40:11,208 --> 01:40:12,958
Anytime I visit him,

1677
01:40:13,041 --> 01:40:13,875
I only talk about it.

1678
01:40:14,166 --> 01:40:16,750
Tell him again. He won't be bored.

1679
01:40:17,333 --> 01:40:18,833
So I'll start here then.

1680
01:40:19,041 --> 01:40:20,791
I went to this wedding,

1681
01:40:21,208 --> 01:40:23,666
and saw a drunk woman wrecking the party.

1682
01:40:23,750 --> 01:40:26,041
Hey, not this one.

1683
01:40:26,500 --> 01:40:28,583
Fast forward. Change the subject.

1684
01:40:29,375 --> 01:40:30,500
Change the subject.

1685
01:40:30,958 --> 01:40:31,791
Fine.

1686
01:40:32,125 --> 01:40:36,166
About a woman who was a thief

1687
01:40:36,250 --> 01:40:37,833
and took what was mine.

1688
01:40:37,916 --> 01:40:42,083
There are many other good stories.

1689
01:40:42,166 --> 01:40:43,458
Tell good stories.

1690
01:40:44,208 --> 01:40:45,833
-Good stories?
-Yeah.

1691
01:40:46,291 --> 01:40:47,291
All right.

1692
01:40:48,625 --> 01:40:50,250
This is a story about destiny.

1693
01:40:50,333 --> 01:40:51,500
Yeah, this one is good.

1694
01:40:52,041 --> 01:40:55,125
Destiny brought me to a woman

1695
01:40:55,208 --> 01:40:57,083
at the breathalyzer checkpoint.

1696
01:40:57,166 --> 01:40:58,000
Oh man.

1697
01:40:58,750 --> 01:40:59,666
It's true.

1698
01:40:59,750 --> 01:41:01,291
Say whatever you want. Suit yourself.

1699
01:41:01,375 --> 01:41:02,250
Really?

1700
01:41:02,416 --> 01:41:06,166
And I had to bail her out.

1701
01:41:07,041 --> 01:41:09,208
But luckily, she wired
the money back to me.

1702
01:41:13,041 --> 01:41:14,291
Hey.

1703
01:41:19,666 --> 01:41:20,791
You still want to be my friend?

1704
01:41:21,208 --> 01:41:22,708
A good friend like you...

1705
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:25,041
it would be a shame to lose.

1706
01:41:26,250 --> 01:41:27,916
I'm sorry.

1707
01:41:28,791 --> 01:41:29,916
I'm taking a photo of the bird.

1708
01:41:30,541 --> 01:41:32,250
-This bird?
-No

1709
01:41:32,333 --> 01:41:33,875
The bird in the tree.

1710
01:41:35,458 --> 01:41:36,583
I'm sorry.

1711
01:41:36,708 --> 01:41:37,708
No problem.

1712
01:41:41,333 --> 01:41:42,625
Destiny.

1713
01:41:42,916 --> 01:41:47,125
Yes. Destiny decides who your soulmate is.

1714
01:41:47,333 --> 01:41:49,416
No matter how far they are apart.

1715
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,500
It's already pre-destined

1716
01:41:51,583 --> 01:41:54,625
that you will finally meet
and fall in love.

1717
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:56,916
Destiny?

1718
01:41:58,083 --> 01:41:59,458
Did she tell you?

1719
01:41:59,833 --> 01:42:01,750
She totally believes you.

1720
01:42:02,000 --> 01:42:04,583
She told me
that destiny will send her a soulmate.

1721
01:42:06,250 --> 01:42:09,916
Do you want me to tell her
that she was conceived because her parents

1722
01:42:10,291 --> 01:42:12,916
made love the first time
they met without condom?

1723
01:42:13,458 --> 01:42:15,875
Don't be loud, she would hear it.

1724
01:42:16,208 --> 01:42:17,333
Hello.

1725
01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:21,041
Are you the person in this photo.

1726
01:42:21,291 --> 01:42:26,583
No, no, no. But this one looks familiar.
As if I've just seen her around.

1727
01:42:26,916 --> 01:42:30,458
Definitely not us.
But the girl in the photo...

1728
01:42:31,000 --> 01:42:32,208
looks exactly like her.

1729
01:42:35,916 --> 01:42:37,625
Let's settle this at the police station.

1730
01:42:37,875 --> 01:42:40,791
-Excuse me.
-"Chotto" means "hold up"!
