He was deported.

My mother didn't want to leave him,

They were apart for 15 years.

My mother always said
that seeing him again

was what made her get up every morning,

that day would be here.

00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,916
Well, you'd better stop
lying to yourself, then,

306
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,125
because, if not,
what the fuck are we doing here?

307
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,000
[Álex] Mmm. That smells good.

308
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,083
It should. Caught fresh yesterday.

-Mmm, you don't say.

[Ramiro talking indistinctly]

311
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,958
You're not happy that he's here, are you?

312
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:25,500
-Your boyfriend?
-[scoffs] No, he's not my boyfriend.

313
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:27,833
That's a shame.
He's so nice and has been through a lot.

314
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,208
No, I meant Ramiro.

315
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:31,125
What happened, huh?

316
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:33,083
Ask your mother.

317
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:34,416
Mom said they were good friends,

318
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,916
and that one day he left
without an explanation.

319
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,791
Well, if that's what she told you,
that's what happened.

320
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,125
Oh, come on.

321
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,166
Just tell me what it is,
because you've been dying to for days.

[Dolo huffs]

[Dolo] Ramiro didn't leave just any day.

324
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,375
He left right after you were born.

325
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:02,750
Why'd he do that?

326
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:06,000
He never admitted it, but he was always
in love with your mother.

327
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,500
Since they were kids.

328

-Ah, so they were sweethearts.
-No.

329
00:14:09,875 --> 00:14:13,458
She always saw him as a friend,
but… they were inseparable.

330
00:14:13,541 --> 00:14:15,083
They did everything together.

331
00:14:15,583 --> 00:14:18,833
To the point that she was never interested
in any other guys.

332
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,916
She said Ramiro gave her
everything she needed, but then

333
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,166
she met your father.

Ramiro hurt her badly,
disappearing like that.

351
00:15:13,041 --> 00:15:15,916
He wasn't there for her
when your father passed away.

352

And now he's back and wants us

I'm sorry, but it doesn't seem right.

I'm more into Tió de Nadal.

-It's a delicious Catalan tradition.
-[woman] Mmm.

359
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:40,708
During the entire month of December,
little kids adopt a log.

-A log. Mm-hmm.
