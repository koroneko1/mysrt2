00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.460
You're late!

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.940
It's you who are late!

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.460
Do I know you?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.460
Why do you say like that?

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.100
You lose again!

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.220
What do I lose?

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.940
Last time you told me that I was a loser.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.020
Because you showed up yourself who you are.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.700
Oh, I see.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.720
You mean the stranger game, meeting and greeting like we don't know each other, right?

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:46.780
Yes.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.940
The loser is the one who reveals yourself or acts like knowing another person.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:01.220
The loser has to do whatever the winner requests.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.900
Okay!

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.620
I admit that I'm a loser now.

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.820
What do you want me to do, the winner?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.860
I will tell you later.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.300
Okay, it's up to you.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:34.700
Anyway, why do you want me to come here?

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.940
I'll tell you later!

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.740
Just kidding! Come with me.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.620
Why don't you say hello to my dad?

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.660
Hi, dad!

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.860
Like this?

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.380
Every time when I feel happy, I'll come here.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.300
Does your father know that you come to visit him?

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:23.860
I don't know.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:35.020
Have you ever heard that the one who passed away within 99 days can feel the happiness.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:56.500
Mork...

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.620
Yes?

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:01.340
Let's have the swimming competition.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.340
What's the winner's reward?

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:20.860
The winner can do anything with the loser.

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:57.460
I'm a winner!!

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:03.860
Every swimming competition with you, I always be a loser.

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:15.140
For swimming competition next time, I'll let you swim first and I follow.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:03.940
Come here.

00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:07.940
Let me wipe your hair.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.540
Is this the consolation prize for the loser?

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:22.740
Please don't say like that.

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.460
As a loser, what do I have to do for you?

00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.060
What should I do?

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.060
What're you doing?

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:06.660
I just want to know how smell the loser is.

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:08.660
I'm not okay from what you're going to do.

00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:22.500
If you're not satisfied, punch me!

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.340
I'm leaving now.

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.940
What's happen?

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:19.460
I don't know what to say.

00:13:23.220 --> 00:13:25.220
Forget it!

00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:27.820
How can I help you?

00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:29.820
I'm so tired. I'm going to bed now.

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.860
I'm so sorry for what I did last night.

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:16.260
Pardon?

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.780
It's about...

00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.780
Let's change the topic.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.520
Beautiful, isn't it?

00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.340
Yes.

00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:42.780
You like this place, don't  you?

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:44.780
Sure.

00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:54.740
Mork...

00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.740
Once you graduate from your high school, will you continue your study here with me?

00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:00.740
I'm not sure.

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.780
If I see you often,

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:08.780
I'm afraid you're bored with me.

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.780
You're annoying me!

00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:22.420
I'm just kidding!

00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:25.460
You want me to force you, don't you?

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.460
Please forgive me, P' Tiew.

00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:35.980
You're just a baby boy.

00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:45.980
Mork...

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:49.260
Let's have a trip to Chiang Dao on the day after tomorrow.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.260
Hmm...

00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:06.940
You promise me, don't you?

00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.940
Okay.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:20.940
Let's go.

00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:04.340
Welcome. What would you like to order, please?

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:10.340
May I have your order?

00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:20.140
Food or drinks?

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:25.620
Expresso, please.

00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:26.740
Drink here or take away, sir.

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:28.740
Here, please.

00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.740
Please wait for a moment.

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:39.420
Excuse me, expresso is ready to serve.

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.420
Thank you.

00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.420
You ground coffee finely.

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.420
I'm so sorry.

00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:58.340
Yes, I ground it.

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.340
How about...

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:04.340
Please receive your call.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.340
Thank you, sir.

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:08.860
If you need anything, please let me know.

00:19:29.140 --> 00:19:31.140
Hello, what's up?

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:34.700
You seem happy.

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.700
Yes, I'm very happy.

00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.460
Ai P' Tiew invited me to the trip.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:39.740
Where will P' Tiew invite you to go to?

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.740
Chiang Dao on the day after tomorrow.

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:43.740
Will you join him?

00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.740
Yes, of course.

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.740
I would love to join this trip.

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.300
I have to hang up your call. The customer is waiting to order.

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:54.300
Okay.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.300
Talk to you later, bye.

00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:05.900
Can I help you?

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:12.420
You're the part-time staff who just came yesterday, aren't you?

00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:14.420
Yes, I am.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:17.940
Are you a regular customer?

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:22.700
Please feel free to provide your feedback.

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:36.740
Coffee beans from the same species and from the same coffee plant

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:42.420
but with different coffee grind methods,

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.420
will make the taste different.

00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:52.940
If you mix them,

00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.580
the taste is not as good as expected.

00:20:59.540 --> 00:21:02.700
Baristas who mix them are not sincere to the customers.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.940
If you want to be the real one, don't mess up and do the right thing.

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:28.940
Do you agree with me, Mork?

00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:36.740
What do you think?

00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:48.380
Who are you?

00:21:50.380 --> 00:21:55.340
I'm not only trusting but also wondering.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.340
Pardon?

00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:00.860
I'm monitoring,

00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:04.260
and controlling.

00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:14.860
I'm taking care of this cafe.

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:16.860
I'm the one who let you work here.

00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:24.540
Oh, Sawasdee krub (Hello).

00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:29.060
I'm sorry that I don't know you. Please forgive me.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:37.940
You don't need to apologize. Actions speak louder than words. Do your best as you can.

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:45.500
Are you satisfied with my coffee? If not, please let me try again.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:47.500
I won't disappoint you again.

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.700
It's not so bad.

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:56.700
Thank you.

00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:59.660
Why do you call my name....

00:22:59.660 --> 00:23:04.300
I think you have to do your job now. It's time to close the cafe.

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:05.860
Yes, sir.

00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:06.620
Please take your time.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:08.620
Thank you, sir.

00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:38.940
Are you going to sleep?

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:40.580
Yes, I'm.

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.580
There is something I need to think about.

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.580
Wait...

00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:49.700
What happened last night?

00:24:19.820 --> 00:24:21.820
