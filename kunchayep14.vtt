00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Tian, we don't have time.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.000
Let me explain everything to you.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.000
A scum like you do everything for money.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.000
Let him go.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.000
There's no time. / Just go. 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.000
Don't hurt Mr. Tian. / Tian. 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.000
Go, go!

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.000
Sir, Jiu get in here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If they get him, Mr. Tian's secret must be revealed.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.000
Kill Jiu before he spills Tian's secret.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What kind of powder is that？

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Or is this the thing that killed Dong?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Sir, Sir. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
How is Jiu?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
He could run away. 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.000
Do you think I'm stupid?

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.000
You're just unlucky that you fell in love with the wrong guy. 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.000
on the association meeting day, you have to announce your marriage.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I will find you a woman.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.000
It's too late, Mother. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Jiu told Mr. Ma already that I am a homosexual. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Jiu.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Lady Pin.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
She might be on Mr. Yang's side. 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Noi, stay here. If Father comes home, tell me.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.000
Okay. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Mei.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Mei.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Why are you here?

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.000
Jiu.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.000
What happened?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Where did he go?

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Mei, who hurt you?

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000
Tell me. Who did this to you?

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Jiu. 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
What have you done?

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.000
No, Jiu. 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
That sister helped me.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
So Mr. Yang took Mei out of Mr. Ma's house?

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Yes. 

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.000
And he also said that there was a boy trapped in there.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.000
But he couldn't help him out.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
That's Fu, my younger brother.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.000
Why Mei is like this?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000
The doctor said that your sister is addicted to opium.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
This is your sister's medicine.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Thank you, sir. 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Since Mei got your medicine, she's getting better. 

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
That's medicine is opium?

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Where are you going?

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.000
Oh, sorry.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I'm going to kill Mr. Ma and help Fu out.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Hey, Jiu. 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
You're still injured.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
If you go now, not only you can't help your brother, 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
but you might also be in danger.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:34.000
Believe me. Stay here and get some treatment.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Please.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Everything is because of me alone.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
I made Mei addicted to opium.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
I hurt everyone.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
I hurt my sister and Tian.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
I am the cause of everything.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Hey. 

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Don't die yet, boy.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000
You're still useful to me. 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Gui, I'll give you rice and water to eat.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Take good care of him, don't let him die.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
I'll use him as a bargaining tool

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:06.000
to make Jiu talk about Tian's secret in front of others.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000
Jia. 

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
When we attacked Jiu,

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I saw the orchid dust touched his harm.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Do you think he'll die?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Normally, we will throw the dust in the face

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
to let it get through the airway into the lungs.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
It will grow quickly and cause the victim to die.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
But if it touches the skin, the poison can grow as well, 

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000
but it will take some time.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Mother. 

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Mr. Ma knew about it all.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.000
You still insist that I should announce the marriage?

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:02.000
Right. 

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:06.000
But don't worry. I have a way to deal with it. 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
I don't want to hurt anyone as well. 

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000
If you do everything as I said, 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
everyone will be safe.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
You're threatening me. 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
I didn't.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000
I didn't want to do this.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
If there is a way that no one will hurt or die, 

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.000
I'm ready to do it.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Will Tian believe her mother?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Mother. 

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Even if I announce the marriage, 

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Father will never stop suspecting.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000
And when he keeps investigating, 

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000
he will know one day that you have poison that is used to kill people.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And if that day comes, 

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
what are you going to do?

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Jia and I have already thought about it.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
How it should end.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:22.000
what are you going to do?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I have a solution.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000
I know that. 

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I must pay for killing someone. 

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000
But I can do everything

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
to make you get through this

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000
and get the position of association head. 

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Don't cry. 

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I've talked to Tian already.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
He's getting married according to our plan after all. 

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.000
If only we can get through the general meeting of the association.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Jia, Jiu's hand that touched the dust.

00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.000
He must die, right?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
I'm afraid that he would show up and interfere with our plan. 

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Don't worry. He got poisoned like that.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Even if he lives a normal life, 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.000
the infection will gradually spread.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000
The more he runs, exercises, and moves his body, 

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.000
the more his blood pumps and accelerates the poison to his heart.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
The infection will go like a wildfire until he dies. 

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Why hasn't the wound on your hand healed yet?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Do you want to me to call the doctor?

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000
It's okay. 

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000
I'm not hurt anymore.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000
But I have something to ask you. 

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
You can tell me. If there's anything I can help you, I will do.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000
I'd like to see Tian one more time.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Let him know the truth from my own mouth.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Do you have any business to discuss with me?

00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.000
You call me to talk at the back of the palace.

00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:16.000
Looks like there's a secret.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Yes, it's a secret.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
My father doesn't know about it. 

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Jiu, you dare to invade here too?

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:42.000
Yang, calm down. 

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Jiu!

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:43.000
Listen to him first. 

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I'm sorry.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
I'm sorry I deceived Tian.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
But I really love him. 

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Jiu. 

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Who is it?

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
It's you. 

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Let's go. 

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
Please take Mei with you. Hurry up, go. 

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Jiu's sister is sick.

00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.000
Mr. Ma gave her opium and tricked them that it was medicine.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
So Jiu had to work for him to save his sister.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
He had to approach Tian to find out the secret.

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.000
But he really loves Tian. 

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Yang. 

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Can you take Tian to meet Jiu one more time?

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:47.800
Pin. 

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
His love hurt Tian. 

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
I can't let them meet again.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000
And now everyone knew that he was Mr. Ma's subordinate.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
The love of Jiu and Tian has too many obstacles.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
It's impossible.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Yang. 

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Do you think so?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Pin. 

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000
If Jiu really loves Tian, 

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000
he need to let him go.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000
The two of us has to be like that too, right?

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000
What do you mean?

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Think about it carefully.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I was once Tian's fiancée and changed my mind to love you instead.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000
If others know about this, what will they think of me?

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:49.000
I loved the elder brother, and then younger brother.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Do you think that my father and Mr. Song will agree and be glad about this?

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000
They'll definitely disagree about our love. 

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
So are we going to give up to such an obstacle easily?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
What? What did you say, Madam?

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Are you deaf?

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Jia. 

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
I said that I'll let you marry Tian.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Is it true, Madam?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Don't be too happy.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
You're not going to be the first wife after all.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Just getting married to make Mr. Tian able to take the position.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
Don't overestimate yourself. 

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:58.000
If your wedding goes well,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000
you can tell me what you want.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:06.000
I will repay your kindness. 

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.000
You have promised me, Madam. 

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
You can go now.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
I don't trust her at all, Madam. 

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000
We'll use Mud as a substitute first.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000
She is someone in our house. At least we can control her. 

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
As for Mr. Ma, 

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
we just follow the plan.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Kill him before the meeting day. 

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000
What?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Letting Tian get married to Mud?

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000
What do you think you're doing?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.000
I know that we are in trouble.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
But let's put that matter aside for now. 

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
The situation is bad.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Mr. Ma wanted to destroy the Song family.

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.000
Trying to prevent Tian from taking the position. 

00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:17.000
We should announce Tian's wedding on the day of the association meeting.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
When he gets married and takes the position, 

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:22.000
Mr. Ma won't be able to do anything to us after that. 

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
And what did Mr. Tian say?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000
He agrees with me. 

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
He understands and is ready to do anything for our family.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Are you sure you're doing for the Song family?

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.000
You let Mud marry Tian.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
She have slept with almost all the male workers in our house.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000
If you can't find a good woman, don't rush.

00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:54.000
Why do you urge Tian to marry a woman like Mud?

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Why do you have problem?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Tian is my son.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:01.000
If you disagree with the wedding, 

00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:03.000
just wait for your son's wedding.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000
It's my problem, of course. 

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
You let Tian marry a slut.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
You must have a plan. 

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:13.000
Right. 

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000
And I told it to Mr. Song already.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
What is it, Sir?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
If I tell you, you'll tell it to Mr. Ma again.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:27.000
Madam!

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.000
Why? / Stop!

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
Sir, Sir. 

00:23:31.800 --> 00:23:32.000
Sir. / Mr. Song.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Sir, Sir. 

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Hurry up and bring the inhaler.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
And a fan too. 

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:43.000
Sir. 

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Sir. 

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Sir. 

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Did Li allow you to marry Tian?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
I expected you to only become his mistress, his secret wife. 

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
That's strange. There are so many good women out there.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Why did she choose you?

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Madan Li is in a hurry.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:13.000
She will announce the wedding on the day of the association's general meeting.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
And Mr. Tian will be appointed to be the leader after Mr. Song. 

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Is it related to his secret, Madam?

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Tian's secret.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Tian.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.000
What's wrong, Madam?

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
In the past, the association had another member.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Mr. Zhang

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
He committed suicide because Ma exposed him as a homosexual. 

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.000
A gay. 

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Why are you talking about this?

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Or do you think Mr. Tian is…

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
If it's really what I think, that's great. 

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
You find out that secret.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
If you're successful, 

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
we will have power over everyone in the association. 

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Who is it?

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
It's me.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Come in.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000
How are you feeling, Father?

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
I'm still tired.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000
The doctor said that the relapse was probably due to extreme stress.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
I have to rest

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000
and don't think too much.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:36.000
What can I do?

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:40.000
It's not easy. 

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000
About your marriage,

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
you don't want to, right?

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Not at all, Father.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000
I'm your dad. 

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Why don't I know that you don’t want to get married?

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
I can't help but think about it. 

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Because you were born in the Song family, 

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000
so you have to follow me. 

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Otherwise, 

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000
you could have follow your heart more. 

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
You are my son,

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
that's why you have to bear everything of our family. 

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
You must really hate this house.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
I never thought that.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:49.000
I understand that you and Mother are worried about me.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000
Father.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000
don't worry.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
When the day of the general meeting comes, 

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:05.000
everything will be alright. 

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Thanks a lot

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
for your sacrifice.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000
You're late again, Yang.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Do you see that everyone is waiting for you?

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Don't scold him, Father. Today is a good day.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000
That's right, our family is having good news.

00:29:18.300 --> 00:29:19.000
Don't scold him. 

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Good news? What good news?

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
I'm getting married.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Really?

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Yeah. 

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Getting married quickly. Don't know what other plans you have. 

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Madam. 

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Don't say that. 

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Mr. Song is not feeling well. The doctor doesn't want him to be stressed.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.000
Let's eat.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Sir. 

00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.000
Thanks. 

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Zhang Zhitian.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Zhang, Zhang, Zhang. 

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.000
Zhang. 

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:22.000
I'd like you to know the pain I got,

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000
so that you can understand how I feel. 

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000
Bao said that you're here. 

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Spirit tablet of Mr. Zhang.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
What are you thinking?

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
I'm thinking about that day

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
when Zhang committed suicide in front of me.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
But it's been a long time.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
No matter how long it is, 

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.000
I never forget.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
His eyes and his words towards me, 

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000
it sounds very painful.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
It always echoes in my head.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
I didn't know 

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
how much he suffered,

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
so that he decided to do so.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000
Sir. 

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Tian.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Yang.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Are you really going to get married?

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Why?

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.000
I made up my mind already. 

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Look at this first. 

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000
You may consider about the wedding again.

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Tian.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:54.000
I want to explain everything.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
I have to work for Mr. Ma

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:03.000
because he told me he had medicine for Mei's illness.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
But I just found out

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
that the medicine is opium.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:12.000
I'm really stupid.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
I can't help my sister and brother.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
I also hurt you. 

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
I'm sorry.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Please come to meet me tomorrow. 

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000
I'll tell you everything

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
and let's run away together. 

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
I love you, Tian. 

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Mr. Yang.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.000
Didn't Tian come with you?

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000
He let me give you this letter.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
I can't meet you as you said. 

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.000
It's not that I don't love you

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
or still angry about Mr. Ma. 

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
I understand that you have a reason.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
If it were me, 

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
I may choose to do the same thing.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Jiu. 

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:44.000
The two of us are lucky but not enough to be together.

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
What we've been through together

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
made me know what love is. 

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:55.000
It taught me that there's someone who really loves me like you in this world.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
But in this world, it's not just the two of us.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000
I have a duty to do

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000
and I couldn't leave it.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
I've made up my mind carefully. 

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Please believe in what I choose to do.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Lastly, 

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
I will miss you.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:22.000
I will keep you in my memory forever.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000
I hope you miss me too. 

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000
What's wrong?

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Is this Tian's letter?

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.000
What did he say?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Tian said he wouldn't see us again, Mei.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Why?

00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:37.000
Didn't you say you two love each other?

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Why are you not together?

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
He had already chosen his path.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
We must go our way.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Mei.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I'll go pick up Fu, then let's get out of here.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.000
We agree to cooperate with you

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000
because I think you won't break the promise you made to us

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000
that you'll sell all the goods from your association, including oil and rice

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000
to us at the price three times lower than the market price.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
If you can't do it, you know what's going to happen, right?

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
I know it. 

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.000
If only I can take the head position of Five Dragons Association, 

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000
I'll determine the price of all products.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:29.000
I will sell products to Japanese soldiers at cheap prices.

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:33.000
I will raise the purchase price from the villagers.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:36.000
I can only see profits now. 

00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:37.000
Great. 

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000
So we'll have the soldiers ready.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
When you want to use them, just let me know.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000
In a few days, there will be a big meeting at the Five Dragons Association.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:54.000
I will take the head position of head for myself. 

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
If it turns out to be what I think, 

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Big Brother will have to do everything

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.000
because his son that he expects to inherit his position

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
has done something embarrassing.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:12.000
But if they are stubborn, I need to request Japanese troops from you

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
to get rid of them, Captain. 

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:17.000
Don't worry. 

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.000
No matter how big or powerful Mr. Song is,

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.000
if he has a fight with Japanese soldiers,

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Thai authorities or anyone won't dare to help him.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Good. 

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Hey who is it?

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
Gui. 

00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.000
It's Jiu, Sir.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Shoot him. 

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Watch out, Sir. 

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Hey, he ran away!

00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:18.000
Catch him! Hurry!

00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.000
Yes, Sir. Go. 

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Fu. 

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Fu, Fu.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:50.000
Fu. 

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Fu. 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Fu, Fu.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Fu. 

00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Fu. 

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
I'm here to help you. You're alright. 

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Jiu. 

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Let's hurry up, Fu. Let's go.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Hey, stop! Where are you taking the kid?

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Let's go, Fu. 

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.000
Stop.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000
This route is the route that Mr. Ma regularly uses to come here.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Passing this intersection, there is a forest.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000
Shall we attack him here, Madam?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
It's true that not many people pass by here.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
But it is a dense forest.

00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.000
The two of us may not be able to fight men that much. 

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
If Mr. Ma runs away, 

00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:05.000
there can be many places to hide. It'll be hard for us to look for him. 

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Better take this way.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:14.000
There aren't a lot of people passing by.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000
But it's a sparse forest. It should be convenient for escaping.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
I hope everything works out.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Please don't let anything go wrong.

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000
About both Mr. Ma

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
and Jiu. 

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Regarding Jiu, don't worry.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:41.000
He's a human, not a stone. He has to move his body.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Perhaps he is fleeing somewhere right now.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:50.000
But the more he runs away, the more tired he'll be.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:53.000
The more he moves, the closer he is to death.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
The poison of orchid will slowly get into the blood

00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:59.000
and suck his blood. 

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000
The one who is exposed to it will begin to suffocate.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:05.000
Eventually he coughs up blood and dies. 

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Fu, quickly.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Let's go. 

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:30.000
What's the matter?

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Jiu. 

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Jiu, Jiu. 

00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.000
What's wrong with you? Jiu.

00:47:40.300 --> 00:47:41.000
Jiu. 

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
They're almost here.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Fu, run away quickly. Don't worry about me. 

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:53.000
Ni. 

00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:55.000
Go, I told you to go. Go! / No, no.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:57.000
Go! Just go! Hurry!

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:31.000
You two go catch the child.

00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:33.000
You come with me.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Where did he go?

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
This way.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Where is he?

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:19.000
I don't know. 

00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:20.000
Let's go that way.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Where did he go?

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Let's find him, he can't go too far. 

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Officer. 

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:40.000
I'm here to give you a clue about a worker named Dong who died in the Song family.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Even if I announce the marriage, 

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Father will never stop suspecting.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:18.000
he will know one day that you have poison that is used to kill people.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000
And if that day comes, 

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.000
what are you going to do?

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:27.000
I have a solution.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
I know that. 

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000
I must pay for killing someone. 

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.000
But I can do everything

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000
to make you get through this

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.000
and get the position of association head. 

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Yang.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Did you follow me here?

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
I'm wondering what exactly you are doing.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Nothing.

00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:15.000
Nothing? Then why are you here?

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Hey, you're not alone.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Tell me so I can help you fix it. 

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
I finished everything. 

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000
You're not going to tell me?

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.000
If you don't, I'll go ask the police myself.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Yang, Yang.

00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:35.000
Brother. 

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Fu. 

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Tian, please help me. 

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000
Jiu said that he would pick up Fu.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000
But he disappeared all night and hasn't returned yet.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:01.000
It's alright, Mei.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000
He'll come back soon.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Yang, Tian.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Fu. / Mei.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
Mei said that Jiu went to help his brother out. 

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
And where is he?

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Jiu…Jiu is dead.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Fu, let me ask you.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
What happened last night. Is Jiu really dead?

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Last night, he saved me, but was caught by Mr. Ma. 

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:57.000
So he let me run away first.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Jiu is dead, Mei. Jiu is dead.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:40.000
I saw someone sneaked into the house.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000
I'm afraid he will hurt you.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:00.000
You can hate me for being this. 

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
I never hate you.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
I love you, Tian. 

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:37.000
I already know. A scum like you do everything for money.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Don't let me see your face again.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Tian, listen to me first.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Go away. 

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
No, I'm not leaving. 

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Go!

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Tian. 

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Yang. 

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.000
Jiu…

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Jiu is dead. 

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Tian. 

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Parting is better than death.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.000
At least I still know that he is somewhere living a happy life. 

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
But he is dead. 

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
Last time we met,

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:25.000
I spoke badly to him.

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Tian. 

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Listen to me. 

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.000
At least,

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
you lived happily with him once. 

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000
I believe...

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:53.000
that he could feel how much you loved him.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
It's okay. 

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Destiny brought us together up until here.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
Yang. 

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Fate brought Mei and Fu to meet us.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Can you and Pin take care of that two of them for me?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Tian. 

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Why do you say this?

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Where are you going?

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
I have a duty to do.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Our people didn't find Jiu, Sir. 

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.000
And where did that bastard go?

01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:22.000
We didn't see his body?

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:23.000
Right, Sir. 

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.000
If Jiu is not dead and helps Tian when we expose him, 

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000
what should we do, magnate?

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Inform Captain Hiroshi, requesting for Japanese troops to help us tomorrow.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.000
If you can't use soft way, we have to do this the hard way.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.000
Go.

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000
May God protect our family. 

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Please let tomorrow's ceremony go well.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Tomorrow is a good day, an auspicious day

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Everything must go smoothly, Sir. 

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Tomorrow before the ceremony starts, we have to stop Mr. Ma.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Kill him before he arrives.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Mr. Ma has absolutely no way of exposing Mr. Tian.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Everything will be fine, Madam.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
You look gorgeous today, Mud.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
You have to call her madam.

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000
She is about to marry Mr. Tian.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:31.000
You're lucky. 

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Thanks. 

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Oh, you finish getting dressed?

01:03:42.300 --> 01:03:44.000
I thought of going to help you.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Mud, you go get ready. The ceremony is beginning soon. 

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Wish the ceremony would be thwarted. 

01:04:02.300 --> 01:04:03.000
Mom. 

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
After everyone is here at an auspicious time, 

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:15.000
the ceremony will begin by paying respect to the ancestral spirit tablets over there.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
After it's done, the meeting of the association will begin. 

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:24.000
Once the results of the annual trade have been reported, 

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
you can announce that Mr. Tian is getting married

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
and then give the workers money envelopes.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Do you have anything you want to add?

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Let me think.

01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.000
If I want something, I'll let you know. 

01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:43.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Is there anything that...

01:04:46.300 --> 01:04:47.000
Madam.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:48.000
Madam. / Li.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Madam. / Li.

01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.000
Madam faints.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Don't gather here. Go get a fan and an inhaler quickly.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Bring some tea. Tea. 

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Captain Hiroshi said that he would send a force to join us at Mr. Song's house.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000
But he insisted that no one should know about his support.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Jia. 

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Did you call the doctor?

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000
It's okay, Sir. 

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:34.000
Madam might not have got enough sleep, so is feeling dizzy. Having some rest will do. 

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Madam is sick. Should we notify the cancellation of Tian's ceremony first?

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.000
Because the right time has passed. 

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.000
Mom. 

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Don't do that, please. 

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000
If Madam sleeps for a while, she will recover just in time.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Everyone, please leave. I'll take care of her myself. 

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000
I leave her to you, Jia. 

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
They're gone, Madam. 

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Why you stop?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:59.000
There's a fallen tree blocking the road. We can't get through it. 

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Then turn left, there's a shortcut.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000
What's wrong?

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.000
I suspect the tire leaks.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000
What the hell?

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Jia. 

01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000
Gui. 

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.000
Jia. 

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
I made a mistake, I'm sorry. I won't do it again.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. 

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Li. 

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000
It's done. He won't survive.

01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000
I love you, Tian.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Everything

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.000
must end today.

01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000
What should we do next?

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
I've made up my mind, Yang.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.000
Take care of Father and Mother, okay?
