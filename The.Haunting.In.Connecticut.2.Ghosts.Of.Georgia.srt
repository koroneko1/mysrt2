1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000
You're watching from

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Streamflex

3
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,092
I love you, Lisa. I love you, Lisa.

4
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,094
I love you so much.

5
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,849
Listen to me, Lisa.

6
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:24,393
Hey, Lisa.

7
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:29,773
I have something to tell you, Lisa.

8
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,316
Listen to me.

9
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:40,659
I have something to tell you, Lisa.

10
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:47,833
Mama?

11
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,710
Oh, God!

12
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,217
What are you doing up, sweetie?

13
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,763
Did you have another bad dream?

14
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,640
l dreamed about a swing.

15
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,935
ls there one at the new house?

16
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:09,188
Well, if there isn't,

17
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,565
l bet your daddy might just
put one up for you.

18
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:16,528
Come on.
Let's go get some breakfast, okay?

19
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:18,739
-l'll meet you in there.
-Okay.

20
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,796
What does the new house look like?

21
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,341
lt's way out in the country

22
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,719
and there's just lots of room for you to play.

23
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,137
Can we bring my bike?

24
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,223
Of course we can bring your bike, sweetie.

25
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,016
Even though l don't know how to ride it yet?

26
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:50,479
You are gonna have lots of places to learn
how to ride your bike.

27
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,693
-Hey! Heidi!
-Daddy!

28
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,866
-You done good, Daddy.
-Why, thank you.

29
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,160
What about you, huh? What do you think?

30
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,745
Who lived there before?

31
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,913
Nobody, honey.

32
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,748
That's why the bank gave us
such a good deal, right?

33
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,375
Why, thank you, Mama.

34
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,753
Well, maybe you'd rather live in there?

35
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,047
-No.
-That can be arranged.

36
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,675
-No, thank you.
-You could have the whole place to yourself.

37
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,343
-Nope. No, nope!
-Teddy bear could have his own room.

38
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,095
Come on, let's go. l'll race you! Come on!

39
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,347
Go, go, go! Race Mama!

40
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,862
The hell, baby?

41
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,781
You can't find a clearer station than that?

42
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,366
We're out in the boondocks, babe.

43
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,451
We're lucky we get running water.
Thank you.

44
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,162
Well, we don't need water,
that's what beer is for.

45
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:51,707
My beer, by the way.

46
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:17,733
You! Git! God!

47
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,738
Git!

48
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,576
You think that's funny, do you?

49
00:05:55,104 --> 00:06:04,321
Aunt Joyce!

50
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:08,075
Kid, you grow like a weed!

51
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:09,785
Hi!

52
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,455
Look at you, Miss Homeowner.

53
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,416
Well, that didn't take long.

54
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,920
No suitcase?

55
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:23,382
-l am not a freeloader, Andy.
-Today or historically?

56
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,259
Stop it, Andy.
Joyce is just here to wish us well.

57
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,637
ls that so?

58
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:33,809
lt's a goddamn curse
being right all the time.

59
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:35,936
lt truly is.

60
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,317
lt didn't work out with Ray.

61
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,986
Was he the married one or the drunk?

62
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,656
Bit of both, turns out.

63
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:51,076
-What about you? Are you...
-Eleven weeks sober.

64
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,828
Shit, call Guinness.

65
00:06:53,329 --> 00:06:56,248
On second thought
that's probably a bad idea.

66
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,340
l've got alimony coming in.

67
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,634
l wanna be near family.

68
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:10,846
Well, find a place near here, just not here.

69
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,557
Who lives over there?

70
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,809
That's just some old wreck
someone left behind.

71
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:16,893
l'm gonna haul it away.

72
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,562
A girl lives down there.

73
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,690
Nobody lives around here, baby.

74
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,024
When did you see a girl?

75
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,234
Just now.

76
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,696
You know, l've lived in worse.

77
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,907
"Near here but not here," right?

78
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:33,577
You did say that, babe.

79
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,108
Stop it.

80
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,580
Mama?

81
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,084
Why are you crying?

82
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,463
lt's nothing, sweetie. Nothing.

83
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,258
Aunt Joyce is out front,

84
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:14,970
so go say good night
and l'll come tuck you in, okay?

85
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:17,681
Okay.

86
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,646
Mama's crying.

87
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,107
Do you know why she gets sad?

88
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,782
Your mama gets feelings sometimes.

89
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,577
Feelings she doesn't much care for.

90
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,037
What kind of feelings?

91
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:45,000
Tell you what. l want you to try something
for me. Can you do that?

92
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:48,003
Look out there.

93
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:52,257
At what?

94
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:56,261
Don't really focus
on anything specific. Just...

95
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,680
Take it all in.

96
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:10,942
Feel anything?

97
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,944
Help us...

98
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,530
l think so.

99
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,825
And sometimes...

100
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,537
l see things.

101
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:28,543
That's because you were
born with a veil, sweetie.

102
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:32,631
Just like your mama and me. And our mama.

103
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,299
What's a veil?

104
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,970
lt means that when you were born,

105
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,640
you had a sheen over your face,
like a wedding veil.

106
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,559
And sometimes folks
born that way have a gift.

107
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,852
They can...

108
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:50,065
They can sense certain things
that other people can't.

109
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,318
Mama never said anything about it.

110
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,530
Your mama doesn't like this kind of
talk of gifts and feelings.

111
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,034
So let's just keep this conversation
between us, okay?

112
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,994
Now run to bed. Please.

113
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,248
Love you.

114
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,875
l love you, too.

115
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:02,971
l know, Mama.

116
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,183
Listen to me, Lisa.

117
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,397
I have something to tell you.

118
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,985
Listen to me, Lisa.

119
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,154
I have something to tell you.

120
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:22,574
Just be a good girl

121
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:28,329
and listen to your mother.

122
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,082
Listen to me!

123
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:35,420
Lisa.

124
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,174
lt's 6:00 a.m.

125
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,176
How long you been in here this time?

126
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,306
You saw something again, didn't you?

127
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,100
Here.

128
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:56,357
lf these pills ain't working, we sure
as hell shouldn't keep paying for them.

129
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,444
They're working.

130
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,405
Just gets a little tricky
when they wear off, that's all.

131
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:06,159
You should finish getting dressed.
You'll be late for work.

132
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,578
-All right, darling.
-Thank you.

133
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,339
Careful, Heidi.

134
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:23,176
-You need any help?
-l can do it.

135
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,344
Okay.

136
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:27,180
All right.

137
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,169
Hey, neighbor.

138
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,006
Heidi's been gone an hour
and l don't know where she is.

139
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,925
-Well, she's probably just wandering.
-Heidi is not a wanderer.

140
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,303
That's 'cause she's never had anywhere
to wander to. Now she does.

141
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,096
You're just gonna have to get used to it.

142
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,347
Heidi!

143
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,851
Baby, where have you been?
l've been worried sick.

144
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,311
l'm not supposed to say.

145
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:58,646
Who said that?

146
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,774
Damn it, Heidi, who told you that?

147
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,401
Mr. Gordy.

148
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,490
Who's Mr. Gordy?

149
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,742
An old man l met.

150
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:14,412
He said there was a swing set in the woods,
just like in my dream.

151
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:16,122
Remember, Mama?

152
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:17,832
Okay.

153
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,250
Okay, come here.

154
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,046
Joyce, get Andy on the phone.

155
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,843
This is it.

156
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,262
Mr. Gordy told me there was a swing here.

157
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,514
Well, babe, l don't see a swing.

158
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,183
l'll be damned.

159
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,353
There may not be a swing here now,
but there used to be.

160
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:44,400
-Jesus.
-Walk much?

161
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:48,029
Babe, did this Mr. Gordy
say anything else to you?

162
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,949
He said there's money buried in the garden.

163
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,075
Okay.

164
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,118
Okay, sweetie, l want you
to do something for me.

165
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,411
How much money?

166
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:59,207
lf this Mr. Gordy
ever comes up to you again

167
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:03,044
l want you to scream as loud as you can.
You understand me?

168
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:05,129
Okay.

169
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,215
Let's go.

170
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,818
Andy?

171
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:38,199
l'm not supposed to talk to you.

172
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,619
They think you're a bad man.

173
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:43,996
You're not.

174
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,874
-Are you?
-Heidi?

175
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,469
Was that Mr. Gordy you were talking to?

176
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:10,148
Heidi, why didn't you tell us
that you had an imaginary friend?

177
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,317
Mr. Gordy's not imaginary. He talks to me.

178
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:16,237
I was standing right there watching,
there's nobody outside.

179
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:19,157
-Mr. Gordy's real.
-Heidi, stop it.

180
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,953
l don't wanna hear any more talk about
this Mr. Gordy. Do you understand?

181
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:27,957
Seeing things that aren't there, it's just

182
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:30,084
not a road that you wanna go down.

183
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,546
Good night, okay?

184
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,520
What the hell, Joyce?

185
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,315
You've been here a week and Heidi's already
seeing invisible friends?

186
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:54,692
Turns out this Mr. Gordy...

187
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:55,943
He's up here.

188
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,529
And you, encouraging her, coming out here,
digging up my garden,

189
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,240
going on some wild goose...

190
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,304
Don't be afraid.

191
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:27,099
Let them in.

192
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,533
Good Lord, woman.

193
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,368
What'd you do, rob a shopping mall?

194
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:30,288
Courtesy of my new sugar daddy, Mr. Gordy.

195
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,373
Did you tell Heidi
where the money came from?

196
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:35,084
No. And neither will you.

197
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,962
l'm sure there's lots of stuff buried
in these parts.

198
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,506
That doesn't mean that there's a Mr. Gordy.

199
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,924
l beg to differ.

200
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,510
Did you look at the deed to your house?
The previous owner?

201
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,512
Yeah, the bank owned it.

202
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:49,265
Before that. Check it out.

203
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,726
Straight from the county assessor.

204
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,728
Look at the name at the bottom.

205
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:57,440
The Gordy family owned all this land
going back 200 years,

206
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,192
and this J.S. Gordy was the last one.

207
00:22:00,402 --> 00:22:02,320
Then the bank got it in the '70s.

208
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,448
Ask me how they got it.

209
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,537
Okay, you're gonna get
one shot at this, all right?

210
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,080
lf this doesn't go the way
l think it's gonna go,

211
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,457
l'll never bring it up again.

212
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,209
Deal.

213
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,087
Heidi? Come out here a second.

214
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,762
l am looking for a husband for you.

215
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,640
They're all old. You marry them.

216
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,185
-Good girl.
-Okay, pick a winner for me.

217
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,103
But look at them all carefully first.
Can you do that?

218
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,620
You see something, Heidi?

219
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,377
You know that man?

220
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,719
That's Mr. Gordy.

221
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,388
Okay.

222
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,600
Told you he was real.

223
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,395
l told you and you didn't believe me.

224
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,997
Damn it.

225
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,007
My daughter is not conversing
with the dead.

226
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,469
She picked Mr. Gordy's face
out of 50 pictures. Explain that.

227
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,680
That's just your influence coming out in her.

228
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,808
You know what, l don't want you talking
about any of this with Heidi anymore.

229
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,978
You hear me? She is my daughter.
She can talk about it with me.

230
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:02,022
Why would she? You don't listen.

231
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,150
You just tell her what's what,
just like you did with me.

232
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,152
You needed it. You know what, you still do.

233
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,987
l suppose l'd be better off
numbing myself with pills?

234
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,573
-Stop it.
-What, you don't think l know?

235
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,825
That was Mama's trick, too.

236
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,077
And that worked out beautifully for her.

237
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,121
Joyce, go home.

238
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,541
There's nothing wrong with Heidi.

239
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:25,880
You know what it is, Lisa.

240
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,050
lt's starting for her.

241
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,025
Heidi?

242
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,736
Are you awake?

243
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,514
When I hear of a family moving to town,

244
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,724
I visit to see if they've found a church yet.

245
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,643
Because l happen to preside over one.

246
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,270
Folks around here had been wondering

247
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:26,106
when this rather special
piece of property would sell.

248
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,734
Yeah? What's special about it?

249
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:31,654
Aside from it being overgrown as all hell?

250
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,030
Andy Wyrick.

251
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,615
Pastor Jordan Wells.

252
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,661
The property is special because
back around the time of the Civil War,

253
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,747
it was the Station Master's land.
But l'm sure you knew that.

254
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,499
What, like a railroad?

255
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,125
No tracks on this land.

256
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,545
No, it wasn't that kind of railroad.

257
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:50,464
Do you mean, like,
the Underground Railroad?

258
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:54,176
The folks who helped escaped slaves
make it up north? Wow.

259
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:57,012
That's right. Those people
were known as station masters

260
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,683
and one of the most well-known
lived right here on your land.

261
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:02,977
He actually hid slaves on our property?

262
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,061
Yes, ma'am.

263
00:26:04,145 --> 00:26:07,565
Hundreds of men, women and children
passed right through here

264
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:10,985
with nothing but the clothes on their back
and the light of the moon to guide them.

265
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,611
They didn't have flashlights?

266
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,238
No, sweetie.

267
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,532
They couldn't even use lanterns.

268
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,327
The moonlight was the only light
that they ever saw.

269
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,081
lt was the light of freedom
in the Promised Land.

270
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,835
The Station Master
was an extraordinary man.

271
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,504
Entire generations of families
would not exist

272
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:33,966
if it was not for the Station Master
and this piece of land.

273
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,260
So,

274
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:39,013
don't be surprised if you get visitors
from time to time.

275
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,472
Living ones, l hope.

276
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,517
-As opposed to?
-Andy's just having a little fun.

277
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,813
-l do that.
-Well, if you do get any visitors,

278
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:52,151
l hope you'll be more welcoming than
the previous owner, J.S. Gordy, was.

279
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:55,279
He didn't exactly share his ancestor's

280
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,905
hospitable nature.

281
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,283
Between you and me

282
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:02,286
there was something seriously off
about that man.

283
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,871
Mr. Gordy's nice to me.

284
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,291
-Look, Pastor...
-Sweetie.

285
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,918
We'd better get our day started.

286
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:02,781
Hello?

287
00:29:56,753 --> 00:30:08,514
Help us.

288
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,267
Mr. Gordy!

289
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,561
What is that?

290
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,314
Tell me what it is!

291
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:45,152
-Heidi?
-Mr. Gordy!

292
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,820
Heidi!

293
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,324
You know what?

294
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:53,327
l think there is an invisible man around here.

295
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,121
lt's me.

296
00:31:58,833 --> 00:31:59,958
Did you miss your daddy?

297
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,084
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

298
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,336
Right answer.

299
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,879
l've got a little surprise for you.

300
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:06,506
-What is it?
-Oh, you'll find out. Come on.

301
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,261
Look what l found in the back of
your daddy's truck.

302
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,180
Heidi, meet Chief.

303
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,973
Oh, my God!

304
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,141
Daddy, l love him!

305
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,685
Am l the greatest father
in the world or what?

306
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,062
-You'll do.
-Thank you.

307
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:21,480
l love you.

308
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,802
Remember to bring Chief's bowl
back in the house after he's done.

309
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,262
Where's Chief?

310
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,307
Oh, for God's sake. Chief!

311
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,268
Chief!

312
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:04,147
Damn dog.

313
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:11,029
Come on.

314
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,156
lt's gonna be all right.

315
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,830
Chief!

316
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,420
Chief sounds hurt.

317
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,756
Hey, Heidi, why don't you just sit down
right here for a second?

318
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,299
Okay? And...

319
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,301
Don't move.

320
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:35,929
Be right back.

321
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,808
Chief!

322
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,399
Hey! Here, boy!

323
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:49,276
Chief!

324
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:53,447
Chief.

325
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:56,867
How'd you get in there, boy?

326
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,538
Daddy?

327
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:09,087
Heidi.

328
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,343
All right, watch out, boy.

329
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,441
What the hell?

330
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:31,485
Daddy?

331
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,740
Heidi.

332
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,078
Help us.

333
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,459
Heidi?

334
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,339
Heidi!

335
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:38,385
Help us.

336
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,436
Damn it!

337
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,189
l thought l told you to sit tight.

338
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,733
What are you hollerin' about over here?

339
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,536
Come on.

340
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,413
Let's get you home.

341
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,007
Hey, babe.

342
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,801
-You figure out what this thing is yet?
-Yeah.

343
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,929
lt's a trap.

344
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,765
See, you bait that chamber there.

345
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:27,517
Animals, they get in

346
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:29,227
and they can't get back out.

347
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,021
They get weak and starve.

348
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,564
Easy pickings.

349
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,859
Then you get them back out through here.

350
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:37,485
The back door.

351
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,696
There's gotta be a better way to hunt.

352
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,780
That's just cruel.

353
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,199
No, it's smart.

354
00:36:42,283 --> 00:36:43,742
lf you're a taxidermist.

355
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:46,036
Already found three more of 'em
in the woods.

356
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,747
l figure they made good money
for someone, back in...

357
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:52,459
Well, whenever the hell
they still used locks like these.

358
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,463
Well, smash them all up so Chief
doesn't get stuck in them again.

359
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,215
Or Heidi, for that matter.

360
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,625
I love you, Lisa.

361
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,377
Don't be afraid.

362
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:39,130
Let them in.

363
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,481
Hey.

364
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,859
-What's going on, hon?
-Nothing.

365
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,216
l have a bike.

366
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,427
Do you?

367
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,555
lt's pretty.

368
00:38:28,639 --> 00:38:30,348
lt's purpley.

369
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,435
What do you mean?

370
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,104
Really? People are coming?

371
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,481
What kind of people?

372
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,650
Who are you talking to now?

373
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,444
Mr. Gordy.

374
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:44,404
ls that right?

375
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,906
Well, ask him where there's more money.

376
00:38:47,074 --> 00:38:48,992
l can't. He's gone.

377
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,202
Next time then.

378
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,581
He said there's people coming.

379
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,082
Who?

380
00:38:58,669 --> 00:39:01,796
l swear, Heidi, we should take you
and Mr. Gordy on the road.

381
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,965
Who's there?

382
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,427
Stay behind me.

383
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,098
l got an ax.

384
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,608
Hello?

385
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:40,168
What the hell is this place?

386
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,734
Do you see her, too?

387
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,236
Yeah.

388
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,409
Mama Kay?

389
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,912
lt's okay.

390
00:40:16,038 --> 00:40:18,832
My name's Prentiss.
This is my grandmother, Mama Kay.

391
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,334
-ls this your property?
-That you're trespassing on, yes.

392
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,669
We were told we could come back here.

393
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:24,295
Yeah. Bullshit. By who?

394
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,505
Woman in the trailer.

395
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,174
Said she's your sister. Sold us this.

396
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,136
Sister-in-law.

397
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:32,720
What is that?

398
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,139
The shoofly.

399
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,933
Prentiss?

400
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:39,811
Now help me sit on down.

401
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,397
l wanna visit with the little one.

402
00:40:42,857 --> 00:40:44,149
Come on, little one.

403
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:47,152
Be all right, young man.

404
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,948
All right, you gonna tell me
why you came all the way out here

405
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,825
just to buy some ratty old quilt?

406
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:57,620
A long time ago, when this quilt
was hung out here in these woods,

407
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,622
it meant it was safe to approach.

408
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,749
Safe for who?

409
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,711
Mama Kay's ancestors for one. Mine too.

410
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,505
Do you even know
where you're living at, Mr...

411
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:08,882
Andy.

412
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:14,429
Our pastor said we might get visitors.
Something about an Underground Railroad.

413
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,514
This was one of the stations.

414
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,269
Mama Kay's always
wanted to visit this place.

415
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,521
The guy saved a lot of lives, l reckon.

416
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,899
And he deserved better than
what happened to him.

417
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,612
You don't need eyes to see, little one.

418
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,530
But you already know that.

419
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,157
What do you mean?

420
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,784
You asked your father

421
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,995
if he saw me.

422
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:42,248
Now, that makes you some kind of special.

423
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,168
My mama says l'm not supposed to
talk about that.

424
00:41:45,252 --> 00:41:49,088
But you have to be careful
with a gift like that.

425
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,257
Because sometimes

426
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,594
the devil looks a gentleman.

427
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:59,641
You're telling me

428
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,727
all that took place on my property?

429
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,021
Yes, sir.

430
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:07,815
Right here.

431
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:11,277
Guess your pastor left that part out.

432
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,445
Yeah.

433
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,286
Family meeting.

434
00:42:23,457 --> 00:42:26,751
Not you, kiddo.
You stay outside for a minute, all right?

435
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,253
Okay, Daddy.

436
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:30,713
Sit down, Joyce.

437
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,764
That man told Daddy
what happened here, didn't he?

438
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,099
Why can't I know?

439
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,059
It's just not a story for little girls, sweetie.

440
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,270
l'm a big girl. You always say that.

441
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,316
You remember Pastor Wells
talking about the Station Master?

442
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,861
Well, back when he owned all this land,

443
00:42:53,946 --> 00:42:56,990
he was what's called a taxidermist.

444
00:42:57,157 --> 00:43:00,868
He also did something that
he didn't tell anybody.

445
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:05,623
He would help hide people
who were in trouble.

446
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,919
People like Mama Kay's great-aunt, Nell,

447
00:43:10,004 --> 00:43:12,213
and her fiancé, Levi.

448
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:15,133
You see, Nell and Levi had fallen in love

449
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:18,177
and had dreams of getting married
once they were safe

450
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:19,304
and free.

451
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,807
How the hell did people
even find their way out here?

452
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:26,019
There were guides called conductors
who helped them.

453
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,480
And these quilts, they were a code
from the Station Master

454
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,690
telling them where he'd meet them.

455
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,192
-Look here, you see this tree?
-Yeah.

456
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:37,780
There it is, down there. The meeting place.

457
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,909
The Station Master would come get them
and take them to a hiding place

458
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:44,787
somewhere on this property
until it was safe to move on.

459
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:50,043
Well, some of the other land owners, they

460
00:43:51,003 --> 00:43:53,212
found out what the Station Master
had been doing.

461
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,007
Well, they didn't like it very much.

462
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,009
So they did some

463
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,179
very unkind things to him.

464
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,651
They hurt him just for helping people?

465
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,861
They didn't see it that way, sweetie.

466
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:18,279
What happened to Nell?

467
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,114
Did she make it up north?

468
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:21,699
Nell and Levi never arrived.

469
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,619
No one knows what happened to them.

470
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,538
I told you something bad happened here.

471
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:31,834
No, it was a long time ago.
All that evil is over and done with now.

472
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,252
lt's still here, Mama.

473
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:35,505
l can feel it. lt's in the woods.

474
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,507
-lt's coming for me.
-No, it's not.

475
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,801
Heidi...

476
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:42,428
lt's all in your head.

477
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:45,390
-lt's not real.
-But Mr. Gordy said....

478
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,643
There is no Mr. Gordy.

479
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:52,105
Heidi, listen to me. You have to fight this.

480
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:56,150
-You have to put it out of your head or...
-l'll be like you?

481
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,704
Dry off.

482
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,206
lf you loved me, you'd believe me.

483
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,292
lt's because l love you that l can't, baby.

484
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,636
l don't hear you getting out of that tub.

485
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,059
Heidi Wyrick, don't make me
come back in there.

486
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,608
Heidi, what is taking so long?

487
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,285
Heidi?

488
00:46:01,341 --> 00:46:03,426
Oh, my God, Heidi! Oh, my God! Oh, God!

489
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,597
Okay, okay, okay!

490
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,766
Come on, baby! Cough it up!

491
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,776
Heidi!

492
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,748
Lisa!

493
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,083
Heidi!

494
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:37,752
Andy.

495
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,046
What happened?

496
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:44,550
She was convulsing and unconscious.

497
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:47,929
And vomiting sawdust and insects?

498
00:46:50,224 --> 00:46:52,475
-Andy.
-Are you on any medication, Mrs. Wyrick?

499
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,478
You didn't see what l saw. l saw her.
You weren't there.

500
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:57,063
Heidi.

501
00:46:58,232 --> 00:47:00,483
-Do you remember any of this?
-Yeah, baby.

502
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,735
l didn't dry off like l was supposed to.

503
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:06,030
So Mama pulled me out of the tub real hard.

504
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,865
l'm sorry, that's not what happened.

505
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,076
l think they've been through
enough for tonight.

506
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:13,788
Come on.

507
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,629
Just tell me exactly what
we're supposed to do here.

508
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,174
lf you want my advice,
l suggest you consult with a psychiatrist.

509
00:47:25,592 --> 00:47:27,260
Or a priest.

510
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,220
Thanks.

511
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:32,640
-Andy...
-Let's let Heidi rest up a sec.

512
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:39,313
lt's hard when people don't believe you.

513
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:42,942
lsn't it?

514
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,409
Really, Lisa?
We're possessed by the devil now?

515
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,495
Good Lord, people,
it's a blessing, not an exorcism.

516
00:47:54,913 --> 00:47:56,289
Please.

517
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,042
Hi.

518
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,045
Lord, we pray this night

519
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,214
for the soul of an innocent child

520
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:07,800
and the banishment of evil from this land.

521
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:11,596
l want you to pray with me now.
Can you do that?

522
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,063
ln the name of the Father

523
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:24,525
l ask for the cleansing of fear and sickness

524
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:27,236
from the mind and the soul of this child.

525
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:31,866
l ask that you fill Heidi with the warmth
of your love into her heart

526
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:35,328
and that you call upon your angels
to watch over her

527
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,413
and protect her from danger.

528
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:41,167
Mom and Dad, would you lean down
and lay her back for me, please?

529
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,425
ln the name of the Son,

530
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,928
call upon your righteous hand

531
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:56,265
to rid this place of all evil
that may roam here.

532
00:49:22,918 --> 00:49:24,335
Help us.

533
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:45,272
l ask that you bless this child

534
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:48,234
in the name of the Holy Ghost...

535
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:51,070
The souls of the lost,

536
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,572
forsaken and forgotten,

537
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:58,327
and let your cleansing light
shine down upon this place

538
00:49:58,412 --> 00:50:02,081
and upon this little girl now and forever.

539
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:22,601
Amen.

540
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:26,480
May God's love fill your heart, child,

541
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:30,109
and give you peace for all of your days.

542
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,738
Now that wasn't so bad, was it?

543
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,907
You did great.

544
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,460
Mama?

545
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,931
Pastor sent you away.

546
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,207
Lisa!

547
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,232
-Andy.
-Heidi's gone.

548
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:21,483
What?

549
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:23,944
Call the cops.

550
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:54,850
Heidi!

551
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:58,312
Daddy!

552
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:01,940
Heidi!

553
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:08,322
Daddy!

554
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,951
-Any sign of her yet?
-No.

555
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:17,998
Heidi!

556
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,000
-Daddy!
-Heidi!

557
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,711
-Help me!
-Where are you, baby?

558
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,421
Down in the hole!

559
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,092
What hole?

560
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,220
Down here!

561
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:39,353
Daddy!

562
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,105
Oh, my God.

563
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:52,741
Heidi.

564
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:55,869
l can't get out, Daddy. l can't get out.

565
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:59,289
Sit tight, Heidi. l gotta find
a way to get down there, baby.

566
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,374
No!

567
00:57:04,045 --> 00:57:06,046
Heidi.

568
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:16,723
Please!

569
00:57:17,517 --> 00:57:18,517
Shit!

570
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:23,230
Please don't leave me
down here with them, Daddy!

571
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,358
With who, Heidi?

572
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,285
Heidi!

573
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:49,715
Mr. Gordy? ls that you?

574
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:01,059
-Daddy, help me!
-Coming!

575
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:05,189
Daddy!

576
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,648
Heidi!

577
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:15,073
Daddy!

578
00:58:17,285 --> 00:58:25,083
Heidi.

579
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:37,679
Oh, my God.

580
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,079
Heidi!

581
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:05,791
-Daddy, hurry!
-Heidi, heads up. Coming down.

582
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,084
Daddy, hurry!

583
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:09,920
Help!

584
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,004
Watch out.

585
00:59:12,549 --> 00:59:13,882
Daddy!

586
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:15,175
l'm coming, baby!

587
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:25,561
Heidi!

588
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,959
Heidi?

589
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:55,173
-Daddy!
-Heidi!

590
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,675
Jesus.

591
00:59:57,844 --> 00:59:59,886
How the hell did you get down here, baby?

592
01:00:01,848 --> 01:00:02,848
What the hell?

593
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,436
This is where the Station Master hid them.

594
01:00:09,939 --> 01:00:11,189
Unbelievable.

595
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:14,651
How the hell did you find this place, Heidi?

596
01:00:14,861 --> 01:00:16,236
The girl showed me.

597
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,697
ls that the one that you said
was down here with you?

598
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,782
No.

599
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,378
l think something else
is down here, too, Daddy.

600
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,672
l don't want to be here anymore.

601
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,258
That makes two of us.

602
01:00:40,053 --> 01:00:43,263
Most Pine Mountain residents know
the story of the Station Master

603
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:46,350
who helped slaves escape to freedom
as part of the Underground Railroad.

604
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,645
But last night, a young local girl
uncovered a sad, unknown chapter

605
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,730
in the saga right in her own backyard.

606
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:54,650
What authorities believe
are the remains of five males...

607
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:56,276
...discovered in an underground chamber

608
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:58,737
beneath the ruins
of the Station Master's cabin.

609
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,948
Now, the Station Master,
also known as Jefferson Gordy

610
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:04,660
was the great-grandfather
of the late J.S. Gordy,

611
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:06,119
who died in 1978.

612
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,830
For all the lives that were saved
by the Underground Railroad

613
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:11,166
there were also many folks
who didn't make it,

614
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:12,834
who just went missing.

615
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:16,630
And today's discovery is a tragic reminder
of how dangerous it really was.

616
01:01:16,714 --> 01:01:19,966
In this particular case,
when the Station Master was murdered,

617
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:22,386
there was no one to let
the slaves out, who were waiting below...

618
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:23,679
Will you please turn it off?

619
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,681
...and they probably starved to death
down there.

620
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,307
Reporting live...

621
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:29,518
You think that's Mama Kay's family?

622
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,729
They said five males, so l doubt it.

623
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:35,524
Hey.

624
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:36,858
What are you doing up?

625
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,530
l don't want to live here anymore.

626
01:01:41,739 --> 01:01:43,699
lt's all right now, Heidi.

627
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:45,701
The things that we saw,

628
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,452
they've moved on.

629
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:49,579
Their spirits aren't trapped anymore
because of you.

630
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,332
Joyce, please. Spirits?

631
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:54,710
Don't you understand
what's happened here, Lisa?

632
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,378
Those people in the chamber
wanted to be found.

633
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,088
That's what this has all been about.

634
01:01:58,548 --> 01:02:00,132
Now they're free,

635
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:04,136
and there's nothing to be afraid of anymore.

636
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:06,304
Mr. Gordy said it's not safe here.

637
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,725
You've seen Mr. Gordy tonight?

638
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:11,977
He said l shouldn't have
gone down in that hole.

639
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,187
He said l let something bad come out.

640
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:17,315
Okay, it is time for you to go back to bed.

641
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:22,112
Heidi Wyrick, you follow me right now.

642
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,239
We can't be here anymore, Mama.

643
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:27,242
l went in the hole and the bad man saw me.

644
01:02:27,702 --> 01:02:30,495
He knows we're here now and he's coming.

645
01:02:30,997 --> 01:02:32,664
What bad man, sweetie?

646
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,666
The Station Master.

647
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:37,419
-l let him out, Mama.
-Well, Mr. Gordy is wrong,

648
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:40,255
because you know very well
that the Station Master was a good man.

649
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:42,090
No, he wasn't.

650
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,844
Andy, will you please tell her
that there is nothing to be afraid of?

651
01:02:47,013 --> 01:02:50,724
Mr. Gordy said there was money buried
in the garden, Lisa, and there was.

652
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,435
He said that

653
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:56,188
something terrible happened here. lt did.

654
01:02:56,689 --> 01:03:00,066
For something in Heidi's mind,
Mr. Gordy is sure as hell right a lot.

655
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,943
Are you telling me that suddenly
you believe all this?

656
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,322
l believe there was a cave
full of skeletons on our land, Lisa.

657
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:07,783
ls there a...

658
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,912
A "bad man" down there, too?
Hell if l know, but,

659
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:12,954
l say we pack up the truck

660
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,540
and we haul our asses outta here
before we find out.

661
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,003
Heidi.

662
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:08,468
Andy.

663
01:04:10,680 --> 01:04:12,264
l mean, you can't be serious.

664
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:16,142
We don't have anywhere to go.
l mean, where are we...

665
01:04:16,227 --> 01:04:17,477
Where are we gonna go?

666
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,231
Baby, l...

667
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:22,983
l'm sick.

668
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,861
-Heidi and l are sick...
-You're fine.

669
01:04:26,946 --> 01:04:29,114
Heidi's fine.

670
01:04:29,782 --> 01:04:31,116
Tell me something.

671
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,995
How the hell did Heidi get down
in that hole?

672
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,873
Even if she could lift that slab,
which she can't,

673
01:04:37,957 --> 01:04:40,250
it's a 25-foot drop after that.

674
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,710
She didn't have a scratch on her.

675
01:04:43,004 --> 01:04:44,921
Did you ever think that
maybe Joyce is right?

676
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,423
Crazy Joyce.

677
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:49,092
That this isn't some kind of disease,

678
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:52,012
but l don't know, it's...

679
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,389
A gift?

680
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:58,393
You try seeing what l see
and you call it a gift.

681
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,978
l'm just saying maybe it is.

682
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,814
And I'm done letting you tell our daughter

683
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,149
that she's sick,

684
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,943
that she's got some mental disorder.

685
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:09,237
l love you, l do,

686
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,488
but...

687
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:14,117
l won't

688
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:16,202
let Heidi live like this.

689
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:17,662
You understand me?

690
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,373
-l won't do it.
-Andy, please.

691
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:24,544
Look, l have seen enough to know
that it ain't up here.

692
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:26,796
lt's out there.

693
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:30,383
Maybe it's trying to tell us something.

694
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,429
Maybe you should try listening.

695
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,273
lt's sure gonna be lonely here
without you guys.

696
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:48,068
You should leave, too. This is a bad place.

697
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,779
No, sweetie, it was a bad place.

698
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,531
Now it's not. Because of you.

699
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:58,036
-l'm gonna miss you, baby girl.
-Gonna miss you, too.

700
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,961
Hey, Chief. Come on, buddy.

701
01:06:48,379 --> 01:06:49,421
Jump up.

702
01:06:50,423 --> 01:06:53,550
Good boy.

703
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:04,185
Hey.

704
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,521
Chief!

705
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,403
Chief! Hey!

706
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,989
Where the hell's that damn dog going?

707
01:07:16,073 --> 01:07:18,867
Daddy, we need to leave right now.

708
01:07:18,951 --> 01:07:22,120
Without your mama?
Yeah, l'm not sure how she'd take that.

709
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,663
lt's all right. Let me go find Chief.

710
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:26,207
Be right back. Stay here and lock the door.

711
01:07:26,292 --> 01:07:28,960
Chief!

712
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,022
Chief! Here, boy!

713
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,696
Heidi.

714
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:12,962
Lisa?

715
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:15,882
Hello?

716
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:41,324
Why are you here?

717
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,683
Heidi. Heidi!

718
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,436
Heidi!

719
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:42,398
Andy.

720
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:54,285
Oh, my God.

721
01:13:00,709 --> 01:13:01,709
Heidi!

722
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:05,546
Oh, God... No, no!

723
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:15,681
Heidi!

724
01:13:15,766 --> 01:13:17,475
-Heidi!
-Lisa!

725
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,811
Oh, Andy! Heidi's gone!

726
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:22,480
Check Joyce's. Check Joyce's!

727
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:25,817
Joyce!

728
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:31,155
Heidi!

729
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,458
Damn it!

730
01:13:53,887 --> 01:13:54,887
Joyce!

731
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:07,608
Heidi!

732
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:12,864
Joyce!

733
01:14:16,743 --> 01:14:18,536
Come on! Heidi!

734
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,170
Joyce!

735
01:14:27,296 --> 01:14:28,880
Joyce, Heidi's missing!

736
01:14:31,091 --> 01:14:32,091
Joyce.

737
01:14:34,219 --> 01:14:35,219
Joyce!

738
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,304
Let me in!

739
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:40,516
Joyce!

740
01:14:50,736 --> 01:15:06,501
Oh, my God!

741
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:26,604
Joyce, Joyce, can you hear me, Joyce?

742
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:27,980
Joyce?

743
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:11,899
Joyce!

744
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,735
Joyce, please! Heidi's been taken.

745
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:17,321
Where is she?

746
01:16:17,531 --> 01:16:18,739
Joyce!

747
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:23,160
With him.

748
01:16:23,495 --> 01:16:25,246
"With him"?

749
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:26,914
Who's "him"?

750
01:16:28,208 --> 01:16:30,501
Joyce, who's "him"?

751
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:40,803
No. Not tonight.

752
01:16:40,887 --> 01:16:42,263
No.

753
01:16:42,764 --> 01:16:44,015
Not tonight.

754
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:45,683
Lisa.

755
01:16:48,061 --> 01:16:49,270
Don't.

756
01:16:50,522 --> 01:16:52,231
Where's my little girl?

757
01:16:54,359 --> 01:16:55,735
They know.

758
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:57,445
Who's "they," Joyce?

759
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:58,863
Tell me.

760
01:16:58,947 --> 01:17:00,281
Who's "they"?

761
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,540
Go.

762
01:17:11,543 --> 01:17:14,086
Okay.

763
01:18:55,230 --> 01:18:56,731
Heidi?

764
01:18:57,274 --> 01:18:58,274
Heidi!

765
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:20,880
Heidi?

766
01:19:21,923 --> 01:19:23,507
Heidi!

767
01:19:42,861 --> 01:19:44,236
It's a trap.

768
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,490
The animals can get in,
but they can't get back out.

769
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,825
They get weak and starve. Easy pickings.

770
01:20:03,882 --> 01:20:06,634
Then you get them back out through here.

771
01:20:07,010 --> 01:20:08,469
The back door.

772
01:21:04,609 --> 01:21:05,985
Oh, God!

773
01:21:09,656 --> 01:21:11,615
Heidi?

774
01:21:27,841 --> 01:21:29,383
Heidi, baby?

775
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,094
Are you in here?

776
01:22:35,992 --> 01:22:39,078
You remember Pastor Wells talking
about the Station Master?

777
01:22:42,374 --> 01:22:45,709
Well, back when he owned all this land,

778
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:49,046
he was also what's called a taxidermist.

779
01:23:31,297 --> 01:23:33,132
-Mama?
-Heidi!

780
01:23:37,762 --> 01:23:39,346
Heidi, are you okay?

781
01:23:39,431 --> 01:23:40,472
Are you okay? l'm here.

782
01:23:40,557 --> 01:23:43,726
lt's okay, just listen to me.
l'm gonna get you out of here. Okay?

783
01:23:48,064 --> 01:23:49,940
-Mama?
-Okay.

784
01:23:54,112 --> 01:23:55,446
Mama.

785
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:58,323
Okay.

786
01:23:58,408 --> 01:24:00,284
Okay, hold on to me. Hold on.

787
01:24:13,798 --> 01:24:15,758
Help us.

788
01:24:19,387 --> 01:24:20,387
Okay.

789
01:24:20,472 --> 01:24:21,972
Help us!

790
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:32,483
Can you stand up?

791
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:33,901
Okay.

792
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,445
Okay. Careful.

793
01:24:36,571 --> 01:24:37,863
Okay, put your head down.

794
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:51,085
Okay.

795
01:24:51,252 --> 01:24:53,337
We're gonna climb, okay?
lt's gonna be okay.

796
01:24:53,838 --> 01:24:55,839
Okay, hold on right there.

797
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:57,091
Okay?

798
01:24:57,175 --> 01:24:58,467
You can do it.

799
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:21,156
Heidi!

800
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:22,241
Andy!

801
01:25:34,462 --> 01:25:35,754
Oh, my God.

802
01:26:27,265 --> 01:26:28,932
Lisa.

803
01:26:30,768 --> 01:26:32,603
Listen to me, Lisa.

804
01:26:33,188 --> 01:26:34,438
Mama.

805
01:26:34,564 --> 01:26:36,231
You have to let them in.

806
01:26:36,816 --> 01:26:38,233
Help us.

807
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:39,818
Let them in.

808
01:26:39,944 --> 01:26:41,570
You don't listen.

809
01:26:41,946 --> 01:26:43,780
Did you ever think that
maybe Joyce is right?

810
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,408
Maybe this isn't a disease,
but maybe it's a gift?

811
01:26:47,493 --> 01:26:49,244
Those people in that chamber
wanted to be found.

812
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:50,746
That's what this has all been about.

813
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,040
Now they're free.

814
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:54,750
Because of you.

815
01:26:54,834 --> 01:26:56,585
If these pills ain't working,

816
01:26:56,669 --> 01:26:58,962
we sure as hell shouldn't keep
paying for them.

817
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:00,547
They're working.

818
01:27:02,717 --> 01:27:05,010
Just gets a little tricky
when they wear off, that's all.

819
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:14,811
Let them in.

820
01:27:42,215 --> 01:27:43,340
I'll be back for you.

821
01:27:51,849 --> 01:27:54,935
You know very well that
the Station Master was a good man.

822
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:58,855
No, he wasn't.

823
01:28:08,908 --> 01:28:10,367
I love you, Lisa.

824
01:28:20,878 --> 01:28:22,921
Nell and Levi never arrived.

825
01:28:23,006 --> 01:28:24,798
No one knows what happened to them.

826
01:30:17,495 --> 01:30:19,746
-Mama!
-Heidi!

827
01:30:19,831 --> 01:30:21,790
Oh, my God, are you okay?

828
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:23,792
Are you okay?

829
01:30:25,795 --> 01:30:28,505
Where's your daddy? Who pulled me out?

830
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:44,521
lt's okay.

831
01:30:44,605 --> 01:30:46,815
-lt's okay.
-Heidi!

832
01:30:46,899 --> 01:30:48,066
Daddy!

833
01:30:49,861 --> 01:30:52,821
Oh, thank God. Thank God!

834
01:30:53,364 --> 01:30:55,198
-You all right? You all right?
-Yeah.

835
01:31:10,548 --> 01:31:12,132
Mr. Gordy?

836
01:31:42,830 --> 01:31:43,997
Goddamn it.

837
01:31:44,081 --> 01:31:46,166
You know the tire's supposed to go
below the branch, right?

838
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,584
You know what?

839
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:48,835
l don't wanna hear it.

840
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,837
No, it's all right, Andy. Heidi's gonna love it.

841
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,673
Every girl wants her own
dirty rubber nest up a tree.

842
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:57,427
Nobody likes you!

843
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:02,098
This ain't over.

844
01:32:07,855 --> 01:32:10,315
Do you think Mr. Gordy knew
what his granddaddy did?

845
01:32:11,359 --> 01:32:14,277
Probably why he didn't want anybody
on his property.

846
01:32:14,362 --> 01:32:18,573
He wanted the Station Master to be
remembered for the people that he saved,

847
01:32:18,950 --> 01:32:20,617
not the ones he...

848
01:32:21,285 --> 01:32:22,369
Kept.

849
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:25,455
l keep thinking about Mama Kay's family.

850
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:29,292
Well, they are in a better place.

851
01:32:30,670 --> 01:32:32,420
That much l do know.
