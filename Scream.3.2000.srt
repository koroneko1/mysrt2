1
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:34,120
Moving onto the Hollywood Freeway,
we have a multiple vehicle...

2
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:35,750
multiple injury accident.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,710
An absolute mess
from VineStreet to the valley.

4
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,050
If you're in it,
expect a long commute.

5
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,470
If you're not,
seek alternate routes.

6
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,760
If Dan doesn 't want to do a daily rate,
we can talk about a weekly rate.

7
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:48,970
But I'm tellin' you right now,
I'm not goin' below a million.

8
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:51,100
I mean, think about it.
I'm risking my reputation...

9
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,230
as the host
of this country's number-one...

10
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,230
nationally syndicated talk show to do
a cameo in some cheap slasher flick.

11
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,520
I mean, why can't these guys write me
a fuckin' decent part?

12
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,110
You know?
I lived through the fuckin' thing.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:05,280
By the way, did you talk to Cathy
about that Navy SEAL script?

14
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:09,030
Hang on a sec.

15
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,830
- Hello?
- Hello?

16
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,250
- Who's this?
- Who's this?

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
- Who are you calling?
- Oh. You know what?

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,880
- I'm sorry. I have the wrong number.
- That's okay.

19
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,710
Wait a minute. I know your voice.

20
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,680
You sound a lot like that guy on TV.
Um, Cotton Weary.

21
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:27,640
- I do, huh?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:31,060
I think he's got
a really sexy voice.

23
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,220
- Well, thank you.
- Wait a minute.

24
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,020
You are Cotton, aren't you?
Oh, my God.

25
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,770
I am talking to Cotton Weary.
I can't believe this.

26
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,190
You got me. Look, I've--
I've got someone on the other line.

27
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,440
Can you hold on one second?
I'll be right back, I promise.

28
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,700
- Yeah.
- Okay.
- Yeah.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,910
Andrea, uh, I gotta call you back.
Someone's on the other line.

30
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:59,460
So, uh, you a big 100% Cotton fan?

31
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:04,170
- Yeah! One hundred and ten percent.
- That's very good.

32
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:08,090
So, um, why don't you tell me
who you are?

33
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,220
Ooh! You're a naughty boy, Cotton.
Now, what would your girlfriend say?

34
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,680
What makes you think
I have a girlfriend?

35
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,560
I know you do.

36
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:20,650
- I'm right outside her bathroom door.
- Who is this?

37
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,780
She's in the shower.
She's got a nice little voice.

38
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,910
Let's come in for a closer look.

39
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,370
She's very pretty, Cotton.

40
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,490
A step up from
Maureen Prescott.

41
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,910
Speaking of which,
let's play a little game.

42
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,370
Answer right,
your girlfriend lives.

43
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,540
Answer wrong, she dies.

44
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:45,590
- Where's Maureen's daughter, Sidney?
- Who the fuck is this?

45
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,340
Somebody who'd kill to know
where Sidney Prescott is!

46
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:52,140
One chance, Cotton!
You've got connections. Where is she?

47
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:54,430
You listen to me, you fuckin' psycho.
You lay a finger on Christine...

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,100
- and I swear to God I'll kill you.
- Wrong answer!

49
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:03,730
No! Wait!
Hello? Shit!

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,860
- Hey!
- Get outta the way!

51
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,950
- You just hit me!
- Move!

52
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,390
Christine, if you're there,
pick up the phone!

53
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:41,690
Christine, pick up the phone!
Oh, shit!

54
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,420
You have reached 911.
Due to the volume of calls--

55
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,890
Someone pick up the goddam phone!
Move outta the way!

56
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,890
Shit! Shit!

57
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,250
Cotton, is that you?

58
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,460
Cotton?

59
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,300
Honey?

60
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,650
Okay, Cotton.

61
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:16,410
You know I don't like
your Stab games.

62
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:24,410
- Who is it? Who's there?
- Christine?

63
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,170
Hon, you all right?

64
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,590
- I'm home.
-Jesus! You scared the shit outta me.

65
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,880
- You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me.
- What are you talking about?

66
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,530
- Get the hell out of here!
- Okay. Okay, I'm sorry, babe.

67
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,450
I didn't mean to scare you that bad.
It's me. Come on, open the door.

68
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,240
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What the fuck are you doing?

69
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,870
I was-- I was just, you know, trying
to take the game to the next level.

70
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,290
- I'm sorry. Come on,
open the door, Chris.
- The game?

71
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,960
- Yeah, the game!
- What are you talking about?

72
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,090
I'm talking about how much fun it's
gonna be to rip your insides out!

73
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,170
Now, open the fuckin' door, Christine!

74
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,470
- Oh, my God!
- Now you're fuckin' history, baby!

75
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,370
Christine?

76
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,330
Hon?

77
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:51,330
The recent epidemic of roadrage
in Los Angeles.

78
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,670
- Innocent commuters mercilessly
terrorized, even killed...
- Chris?

79
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:58,880
- by these madmen of the freeway.
- Don't mess around, okay?

80
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:01,970
We're gonna make them confront their
victims face-to-face, mano a mano...

81
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:05,810
right here on 100% Cotton.

82
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:10,100
There is carnage on our streets.
And remember, it could happen to you.

83
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,610
Tomorrow on 100% Cotton!
Roadrage.

84
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,690
L.A. drivers fight back.

85
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:19,900
The news is next on channel six with our
exclusive entertainment report live...

86
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:22,240
from tonight's celebrity

88
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:53,600
Oh, shit.

00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,450
Chris?

90
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,500
Is that you, babe?

91
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,790
Chris, if you're in there,
open the door. Okay, honey?

92
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:20,670
Chris? Come on, baby.
Open the door.

93
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,020
Chris! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Jesus!

94
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,430
- It's me, Chris. What are you doin'?
- Stay back.

95
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,230
Stay back.

96
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,610
- Chris, what's goin' on, babe?
- You've gone crazy. That's what!

97
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,900
- Chris, was somebody in the house?
- No! Get back!

98
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,900
Okay, okay, okay.
Just calm down, okay?

99
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,620
- Why do you want to kill me?
- What are you talking about?

100
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:49,040
- Why do you wanna kill me?
- Gimme the club. All right, honey?
Gimme the club.

101
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:52,410
Gimme the club, please.

102
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,130
Christine, get outta the way!

103
00:08:56,380 --> 00:09:00,380
Behind you!

104
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:13,390
Shit!

105
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,370
It was a simple game, Cotton.
You should've told me where Sidney was.

106
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:35,460
Now, you lose.

107
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,140
Come on.

108
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,870
Come on, Cherokee.

Come on, Cherokee.

California Women's Crisis Counseling.

112
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,590
Hey, it's Laura from Monterrey reporting
to work. Can you patch me in?

113
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,710
- Sure. Thanks, Laura.
- Thank you.

114
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,090
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
How can I help you?

115
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,100
Hi. Um, do I have to say my name?

116
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:15,640
No, you don't have to say anything
you don't want to say.

117
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:17,890
- How can I help?
- Um--

118
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,100
I'm 18 years old,
and I have a boyfriend.

119
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,570
- Sometimes he hits me.
- It's okay.

120
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,820
- You can talk to me, all right?
- Thanks.

121
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:30,780
So, in closing, as
the future journalists of America...

122
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,870
there is one thing
that you need to remember.

123
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,450
Being the best means being willing
to do what the others would not.

124
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,370
Break the rules.
Stop at nothing.

125
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,380
Be willing to have the world hate you,
because that is the only way...

126
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:46,170
that you'll get the story,
the facts and the fame.

127
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,170
Thank you.

128
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,680
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Yes?

129
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,970
So you're saying that we should
be ready to go out...

130
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:59,230
and cut each other's throats
because that's what you did.

131
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,190
- Metaphorically, yes.
- Well, tell me, Miss Weathers.

132
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,650
- Was it worth it?
- I'm so sorry. We're out of time.

133
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,940
Gale Weathers, anchor woman for
Total Entertainment.

134
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,700
Thank you very much!

135
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,250
There is a young man outside
who wants to see you.

136
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:25,960
- He says he's with the police.
- The police?

137
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,800
- Detective Mark Kincaid, L.A.P.D.
- Hello.

138
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,880
- That's quite an impressive resume.
- Thank you.

139
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,970
I assume you're not here
for an autograph.

140
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:36,720
I'm here because
Cotton Weary's been murdered.

141
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,640
- Someone killed Cotton?
- And his girlfriend.

142
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:42,180
Someone who left something
he wanted us to see.

143
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:44,980
I'll show you this because
you're the Woodsboro authority
and because you knew him.

144
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:48,570
But I promise you,
if you share this with the world,
it's you I'll be arresting.

145
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,570
I swear on my Pulitzer Prize, which
I plan to win one day, Detective.

146
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,120
This was left on Cotton Weary's body.
You have any idea who the girl might be?

147
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:58,990
Oh, my God.

148
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,790
This is Maureen Prescott.
This is Sidney Prescott's mother.

149
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,830
Hollywood is reeling today
from news...

150
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:09,340
of the murder of controversial
talkshow host Cotton Weary.

151
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,050
Weary had only recently finished
shooting a cameo as himself...

152
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,340
in the film
Stab 3, Return to Woodsboro...

153
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:16,430
the third and final part
of the famous horror series...

154
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,680
based on the Woodsboro
and Windsor College murders.

155
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,640
Before his rise to television fame,
Cotton had been imprisoned...

156
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:29,150
and was later exonerated for the murder
of Maureen Prescott, his former lover--

157
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,240
Just yesterday, Cotton Weary was
shooting here at Sunrise Studios...

158
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,790
his first cameo
in a feature film, Stab 3.

159
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,710
Security here is tight, but we'll see
if we can get a statement. Excuse me.

160
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,800
Always a controversial man--

161
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:53,710
Channel Eight news.
We gotta get in. We gotta get in.

162
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:55,420
No press beyond this point.

163
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:59,430
Alone at night
he crosses flames

164
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,600
Ashe makes a fist
with his red right hand

165
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,980
Look, you're worried about the movie,
then protect the movie, okay?

166
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,070
Hire more security. Hire the National
Guard.Just don't kill the movie.

167
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:16,240
Violence in cinema
is a big deal right now, Roman.

168
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,620
This is not the kind of news
this studio is after.

169
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:21,740
So if we stop making
scary movies, what?

170
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:23,830
All the psychos in the world
will retire? Come on.

171
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,460
I've been makin' horror movies for
30 years, never had a psycho problem.

172
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:28,540
He was your goddamn idea, guys.
All right?

173
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:32,710
An ex-con with a trashy talk show?
He must've pissed people off every day.

174
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,380
Detectives, there's no reason
to presume that Cotton's death...

175
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,550
had anything to do
with this movie, is there?

176
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:43,970
He was making a movie called Stab.
He was stabbed.

177
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:48,440
Probably some psycho fan pissed off
they killed Randy in Stab 2.

178
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:50,520
Well, Tyson, that'd make you next,
wouldn't it?

179
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,570
I am not a Randy substitute.
I'm my own character.

180
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,400
Named Ricky,
who works at the video store.

181
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,360
It's an homage.

182
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,700
Hey! What if the killer's
Sidney Prescott?

183
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,990
I mean, what the hell ever happened to
her? She's probably off in the woods...

184
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,580
livin' like
the fuckin' Unabomber, man.

185
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:09,790
I'm starting to see why
Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer
didn't want to come back.

186
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,550
Guys, this was about Cotton.
We are not in any danger.

187
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:19,010
"We are not in any danger,"
says Candy, page 15.

188
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,090
I don't see you leavin'.

189
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,390
You think serious black actors
my age can just throw away jobs?

190
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:28,480
It's all a business now. They got
Usher doing Pinter off-Broadway.

191
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:30,770
L.L. Cool J's
Shakespearin' in the park.

192
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,400
- Yeah!
- Maybe it's not meant to be.

193
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,070
Not meant to be? You win that
talent search for the new Sidney.

194
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,660
50,000 girls and they pick you. You
gotta be praying this movie keeps going.

195
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,530
Of course I am, but not
at the expense of people's lives.

196
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,750
Oh. Cue the violins, right?

197
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:03,140
Jesus.

198
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:09,180
Deja voodoo.

199
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:14,310
We need this area cleared, please.
Clear it.

200
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:17,110
- Gale Weathers! Oh, my God!
- Shit.

201
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,240
I-- Listen,
I-I-- I know we've never met...

202
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,820
and I don't mind you never returning
my calls, but I have to tell you...

203
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:26,580
after two films,
I feel like I am in your mind.

204
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,910
Well, that would explain
my constant headaches.

205
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,000
You know, I'm sorry things didn't
work out on 60 Minutes II.

206
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,840
- But Total Entertainment,
that's a pretty good fallback.
- Thank you.

207
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,300
I'm sorry that things didn't
work out with Brad Pitt...

208
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,510
but being single,
that's a pretty good fallback.

209
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,590
Gives me more time
for my work.

210
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,390
After all, Gale Weathers,
you're such a complex character.

211
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,890
Oh, and to be played by an actress
with such depth and range.

212
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,900
Uh,Jennifer,
Nick said you wanted to--

213
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,520
Gale.

214
00:16:56,770 --> 00:16:59,780
Dewey.

215
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:05,320
Well, surprise, surprise.
Someone dies and Gale comes running.

216
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:09,790
Gale, I think you'll really appreciate
my character work in this one.

217
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:13,660
- Someone's helped me
understand the real you.
- Someone?

218
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:18,090
Your ruthless ambition,
your private self-loathing...

219
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:21,090
and that lost and lonely
little girl inside.

220
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,170
Lost and lonely what?

221
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,550
You heard me.
Thanks, Dewey, I'll return it.

222
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,140
Lost and lonely what?

223
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,890
- Little girl inside.
- I thought you were
supposed to be in Woodsboro.

224
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,390
Well, I'm surprised
you thought about me at all.

225
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:39,650
Listen, I gotta get back to work.
I really don't have time for this.

226
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,070
- Wait a minute. You work here?
- Yeah.

227
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,990
The movie needed
a technical advisor.

228
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,780
Someone who went through the real
experience, knew the real people.

229
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:50,240
- Hey, Dewey.
- Hey, Tom.

230
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:53,410
Hey! It's the real Gale Weathers.

231
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,750
Real from top to bottom.

232
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,080
Tom Prinze.
Watch your show all the time.

233
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:02,670
You're so right. Pop culture
is the politics ofthe 21 st century.

234
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,670
- Thank you.
- And that story that you did...

235
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,090
last month on me crashing my car?

236
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:10,470
-Wow, was that ever powerful journalism.
-Right, uh--

237
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,930
I especially liked the way
you implied that it was caused
by drinking and drugs.

238
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,060
And that the tyre blowout was faked.
That was great.

239
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,270
Tom, sometimes in journalism
you have to--

240
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,940
Are you parked in the lot?
'Cause I should check to make sure...

241
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:26,900
that nobody's messed
with your brake line.

242
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,700
Who's he supposed to be?

243
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,750
He's playing you? Him?

244
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,040
What?

245
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:41,460
I did not come here
to fight with you, Dewey.

246
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:44,670
- Cotton's killer left a picture.
- Of Sid's mom.

247
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:47,630
- The detectives told me.
- Well, does Sidney know about it?

248
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,510
Listen, Sidney doesn't need
you and your camera in her life.

249
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:54,180
Do you see a camera?

250
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,690
Right. You bought me
this purse, didn't you?

251
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,770
- Yeah.
- Look, it's-it's a habit.

252
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,810
-I-I walk outta the house, I turn it on.
-What the hell is this?

253
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,650
- It's like perfume.
- Gale Weathers?

254
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:06,240
- Could I be more popular?
- No press.

255
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:08,950
Mo press on set.
Get that woman outta here.

256
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,370
- Yes, Mr Milton. Let's go.
- Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Where is Detective Kincaid?

257
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,450
- I am working with Kincaid, Dewey.
- Come on. Move along, miss. Let's go.

258
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:21,790
Rules are rules, Gale.
But, really, it was great seeing you.

259
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:25,670
Stab 3 is a closed set. But just up
ahead is the old Seinfeld stage.

260
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,010
Now, does anybody
need a potty break?

261
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,510
- Oh, I do.
- Yeah, me too.

262
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,390
Okay, let go!
Thanks for your help, boys.

263
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,520
Holy shit, Silent Bob. It's that
TV news chick, Connie-fuckin'-Chung!

264
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,980
Hey, Connie, how's Maury?

265
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:47,860
Dude, I think she likes me.
See how she's lookin' at me?

266
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,280
It's happening again.

267
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,950
Cotton had a lot
of enemies, Sid.

268
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,950
The police aren't saying
it's related to us.

269
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,210
Do you ever think about her?

270
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,670
Your mom?

271
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,010
None of this would've
ever happened if she hadn't--

272
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:11,760
if she hadn't--

273
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,390
Why'd she have
so many secrets, Dad?

274
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,730
Listen, maybe it's time
you came home.

275
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:24,520
I'm worried about you, kid. Out here
by yourself. You never see anyone.

276
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:28,480
The only people you talk to
don't even know your real name.

277
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:32,410
It's as if you don't exist.

278
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:40,040
That's the idea. Psychos
can't kill what they can't find.

279
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,240
Sid, come here.

280
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:03,120
Mother needs to talk to you.

281
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,920
Everything you touch, Sid, dies!

282
00:22:07,170 --> 00:22:10,880
You're poison.
You're just like me.

283
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:15,010
You're just like me.

284
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:21,100
Oh, my God!
What have they done to me?

285
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,980
They'll do it to you.

286
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:28,060
- They'll do it to you, baby.
- Mom?

287
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,740
Roman?

288
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,910
Stab 3.
Jesus, I gotta get a new agent.

289
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,250
Roman?

290
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:42,050
Someone here?

291
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,020
Stan, my man.
He does good work, huh?

292
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,110
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Fuck you very much.

293
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,240
- Tyson, go to hell.
- Well, excuse us, Sarah. Makeup tests.

294
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,320
Yeah, makeup. You can use it.
Damn it, have you seen Roman?

295
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:02,950
Look, everyone in the office
has gone home already.

296
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,080
- He said it was important.
- Everything's important to Roman.

297
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:34,650
Oh, shit!

298
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:44,200
- Director's office.
- Sarah, it's Roman.

299
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:47,370
I'm sorry I'm running late. I'm still
on the 405. I'm about ten minutes away.

300
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:52,080
Oh, it's no problem. I'm just
lookin' at your music video awards.

301
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:55,710
Since I got you on thephone, let's--
let's talk about your character, okay?

302
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,960
What character? I'm Candy,
the chick who gets killed second.

303
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:02,380
- I'm only in two scenes.
- You're not happy with your part.

304
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:06,470
I'm not happy that I am
35 playing a 21-year-old.

305
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,680
I'm not happy
that I have to die naked.

306
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,770
And I'm not happy that my character is
too stupid to have a gun in the house...

307
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,850
after her boyfriend's
been cut into fish sticks.

308
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,360
Great, okay.
So let's--let's run the lines.

309
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:20,230
Fine.

310
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,990
Page28.
Candy's big moment.

311
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,330
Page 28.

312
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,910
Ring-ring.
Hello?

313
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,620
- Hello?
- Who's this?

314
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,920
- Who's this?
- This is Candy.

315
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,050
Hang on.
Let me get some clothes.

316
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,170
See? I don't understand why I have
to start the scene in the shower.

317
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,890
The whole shower thing's been done.
Vertigo. Hello?

318
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,430
And I mean, my boyfriend just died.
Why am I showering?

319
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,730
Why don't we just read the scene?

320
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,940
Candy. Nice name. Is that like
Candy Cane or Candy Apple?

321
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:00,480
Whatever.

322
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:02,860
Come on.
Who is this?

323
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:05,280
I think you have
the wrong number.

324
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:09,030
- But you know my favourite name?
- I'm hanging up right now.

325
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,120
It's Sarah.

326
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,620
Roman, that's not the line.

327
00:26:14,870 --> 00:26:17,290
It is in my script.

328
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:20,340
Has there been another goddam rewrite?
How the fuck...

329
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:23,460
are we supposed to learn our lines when
there's a new script every 15 minutes?

330
00:26:23,710 --> 00:26:27,550
It's not just a new script.
It's a new movie.

331
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,100
- What? What movie?
- My movie.

332
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:36,440
And it's called Sarah Gets
Skewered Like a Fuckin' Pig!

333
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:41,820
Still in character, Sarah?

334
00:26:56,830 --> 00:27:00,330
Shit.

335
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,610
Thank you for calling

commissary menu, press one.

343

Shit!

344
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:23,380
Oh! Fuck!

345
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:41,100
Look, I wanna get something straight.

346
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:45,980
I only got into this because
the police asked for my help.

347
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,190
- Why would the police come to you?
- Well, I did write..

348
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,440
the definitive book
on the Woodsboro murders.

349
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,490
I'm sure you just can't wait
to write another one.

350
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:56,280
- What about you?
- What about me?

351
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,080
You said you'd never leave Woodsboro.
"It's the only place that's real."

352
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:05,420
But now you're here.
Not with me.

353
00:29:06,170 --> 00:29:08,000
Dewey, I took care ofyou.

354
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,840
I waited until you were well,
but I couldn't stay there.

355
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:14,180
It was like dog years. One year in
Woodsboro is like seven anywhere else.

356
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,220
So it's off to Paris for a week?
New York for a month? L.A. forever?

357
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:22,100
It was fucking 60 Minutes II.

358
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,190
- I couldn't say no. I could've
been the next Diane Sawyer.
- Wait a minute.

359
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:29,650
What's wrong with just being
Gale Weathers? I liked her.

360
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,360
It didn't work, Dewey.
We tried. We're different.

361
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,280
You used to say
that was our strength.

362
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,790
- Well--
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

363
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:47,960
Dewey, you're not just here because
of that second-rate K-Mart...

364
00:29:48,210 --> 00:29:50,050
straight-to-video
version of me, are you?

365
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:56,720
Brace yourself, Gale.
All of this is actually not about you.

366
00:29:57,390 --> 00:30:02,020
All of what, Dewey?
You do know something, don't you?

367
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,140
- Off the record?
- Always.

368
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:08,110
Two months ago, the Woodsboro police
got a call from a woman...

369
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:10,190
who said she was with Stab 3.

370
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,030
She wanted to see the file
on Sid, "for research."

371
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:15,110
- And?
- The boys said no.

372
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,200
And she wouldn't give her name.

373
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:19,950
A month later,
the station gets broken into.

374
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,080
- The file room gets ransacked.
- And someone stole Sid's file?

375
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,830
I already removed it.

376
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:30,290
I think someone on the film
is tryin' to find Sid.

377
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,340
- I'm sorry, this is incredible.
- I said, "off the record."

378
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,970
Right.

379
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,720
It's Jennifer.
She needs me.

380
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,350
-Jennifer?
- Gotta run.

381
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,440
- Wait! Dewey, where are you going?
- I'm on duty.

382
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,790
Stop following me.

383
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,120
I happen to be working
for the police, damn it!

384
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:11,840
- You're not a detective, Gale.
- Neither are you, Mr Incognito.

385
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:15,920
- Uh, you left your motor running.
- Damn it.

386
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:20,510
Fans, I can handle. Fans, they want
a picture, they want a conversation.

387
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,010
I can handle fans!
You see this, Dewey?

388
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,930
I haven't had one ofthese in a year and
a half. Someone's gonna pay for this.

389
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:30,860
-Jennifer, settle down. What happened?
- I'm with him.
- You.

390
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:33,480
Like I'm ever going
to win an award playing you.

391
00:31:33,730 --> 00:31:36,740
- There's been a second murder.
- Who?

392
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,820
- Sarah Darling.
- Where?

393
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:41,410
-At the studio.
-Where? Nancy Drew
wants to know where.

394
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,700
Cotton Weary. Sarah Darling.
Don't you get it?

395
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:49,580
Someone's killing them in the order
they die in the movie.

396
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,340
- Dewey, who gets killed third?
- Who gets killed third?

397
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,010
You do.

398
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:14,520
I get killed in Stab 3?
I get killed?

399
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:17,360
- Yeah.
- Dewey, where are you going?

400
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:19,990
I have to get something
from my trailer.

401
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,200
Your--
You live here with her?

402
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:26,160
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God!

403
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:28,830
I needed a place to stay,
and she said she liked having me around.

404
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,000
- Why?
- She says I make her feel safe.

405
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,130
- She says I'm her rock.
- Her rock?

406
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,050
Yeah. If you weren't so concerned
with pretensions and appearances...

407
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,090
you'd be able to appreciate the
positivity and emotional centeredness...

408
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:46,180
I provide a woman.

409
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:50,390
Stone, I'm headed
to the crime scene.

410
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:56,190
You stay by Jennifer's side.
I suggest a search of the grounds.

411
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:59,690
Hey, Dewdrop.
Can I have a word?

412
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,910
Just so it can be straight. I'm
the professional celebrity guard here.

413
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,740
My resume lists Julia Roberts,
Salmon Rushdie, Posh Spice.

414
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:09,790
You are the Hollywood hanger-oner.

415
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,160
'Cause you're just no good
as a cop any more.

416
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,170
Your resume reads
like the obituaries.

417
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:17,090
So how about you take suggestions
from me? All right?

418
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,840
Whatever you say.

419
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,680
Hmm. Same deal?
Found with the body?

420
00:33:23,930 --> 00:33:27,140
- Yeah, Maureen Prescott again.
- This is great.

421
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,890
Ten more murders
and we can publish a calendar.

422
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,980
The old "killer playing
with the cops" routine.

423
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:35,900
Very Hannibal Lecter.
Very Seven.

424
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,610
Doesn't the killer come after
the cops in those movies?

425
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,690
Usually one cop makes it.

426
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,070
- And?
- One cop doesn't.

427
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,160
- Usually.
- Detective Kincaid.

428
00:33:47,410 --> 00:33:49,790
- What do we know? Same killer?
- Hey, hey.

429
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:53,160
Terminal Entertainment,
this is a crime scene, okay?

430
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:55,460
Wallace, Miss Weathers
is working with me now.

431
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,420
- Thank you, Detective.
- You're welcome.

432
00:33:57,670 --> 00:34:01,260
Well, in that case, I'm gonna go dust
for fingerprints with Jane Pauley.

433
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:05,340
Uh, photos, Wallace, please?
Thank you.

434
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:08,430
New pictures, same person.
Anything turn up on your research yet?

435
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:12,060
- Nothing that will help with these.
- What about an increased
police presence around Jennifer?

436
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:15,810
- She's the next one
to get killed in the script.
- She has a bodyguard.

437
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:18,900
And besides, the producers told us
that there were three different
versions of the script.

438
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,650
Something about trying to keep
the ending off the Internet.
You should know that.

439
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,700
You're the technical advisor, right?

440
00:34:24,950 --> 00:34:27,700
Three versions.
Three different characters die next.

441
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:30,160
And we don't know which one
the killer read.

442
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:33,830
Hey, hold up.

443
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,830
All I ever wanted to do
was make a real classic lovestory.

444
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,800
And the studio said they'd let me.
I just had to do
a scary movie for them first.

445
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,170
And now we're shut down,
and I am fucked!

446
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:45,510
God, it's not the end
of the world, Roman.

447
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,720
That is so easy foryou to say. You can
always go back to, to MustSee TV.

448
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,390
You know, I have no movie,
I'm about to turn 30, and it
looks like I'm now the next target.

449
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:58,150
- What?
- You? Why you?

450
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,400
Do you think this wasn't a message?

451
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,110
- Roman Bridger?
- What?

452
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,240
Mr Bridger,
you didn't tell us...

453
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,700
you spoke with Sarah Darling
before she was murdered.

454
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,570
Uh, spoke with her, uh, when?

455
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,910
The guard said she was here
for a meeting with you.

456
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,500
- What meeting? I don't--
- We talked with her roommate too.

457
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:18,580
Says you called Sarah,
told her to come down to the studio.

458
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,670
- Roommate answered the phone.
Says it was you.
- Wait a minute. No, no.

459
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,750
I-I never called her.
I never told her to go anywhere.

460
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,880
Roommate says she knows
your voice, Mr Bridger.

461
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:29,390
Well, she wasn't speaking with me! God!
Look, I did not call Sarah Darling.

462
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:32,720
- Sarah Darling said you did.
- Someone's trying to ruin my movie.

463
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,640
Someone wants to kill
my movie!

464
00:35:34,890 --> 00:35:37,270
All right, we'll talk about
your movie down at the station.

465
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,440
- All right.
- This is the scene
where you come with us.

466
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:43,820
Dewey,Jennifer--
Wait a minute.

467
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,900
She wasn't talking with me
on the phone. I'm coming!

468
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:51,950
I'll call him in. Battery. Mr Riley,
do you have a cell phone I can borrow?

469
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,540
Yeah.

470
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:58,500
- Thank you.
- God. Roman.

471
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:01,330
Remind me not
to sleep with him again.

472
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:05,090
Come here, Cherokee.

473
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,760
California Women's Crisis Counseling.
My name is Laura. How can I help you?

474
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,930
Oh, Laura.
I do have a crisis.

475
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,770
Okay, well, whatever it is,
you can tell me.

476
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:20,560
Oh, my God.
I've killed someone, Laura.

477
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,650
- Are you sure ?
- Uh-huh, I'm sure.

478
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:25,940
I killed someone, I know it!
Oh, my God.

479
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,570
- Well, then, um--
- I did.

480
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,610
Then the people you need to call
are the police.

481
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:35,160
No, I need to call you!
Just you.

482
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,250
I'm sorry, your-your voice--

483
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,880
Don't you wanna know
how you can help, Laura?

484
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,510
Are you listening to me?
Huh?

485
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:51,970
- Who is this?
- It's Mother, Laura.

486
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,810
Now, be a good girl
and turn on the news.

487
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,640
Do as Mother tells you!

488
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:02,650
You're not my mother. How did you
get this number? Who is this?

489
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,650
You know your mother's voice
when you hear it!

490
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:10,190
Now, turn on the news!

491
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,910
And with a second cast member
murdered, Stab 3...

492
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,740
has been officially shut down,
prompting those involved...

493
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,120
to hope and pray that
these killings maybe over.

494
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:21,080
Just one question.

495
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:26,460
Do you think it's over, Sidney?
Do you?

496
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:53,990
The sky was dark this morning

497
00:37:55,030 --> 00:37:58,700
Not a bird in a tree

498
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,630
Is this a wrap party
or is this a wrap party?

499
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,670
Scene 34.
"Maureen's Murder Flashback."

500
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,720
- I never liked that scene.
- That's 'cause you weren't in it.

501
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,850
Scenes 40 through 47.

502
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:22,810
- "The Prescott House Flashbacks."
- Tom, stop it.

503
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,850
You're scaring me.
Two people are dead.

504
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,230
Scaring you?

505
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:30,820
Give the sweet,
young ingenue act a rest.

506
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:35,610
- You're drunk.
- I'm coping.

507
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:40,160
I bet she fought and clawed
for that Sidney part.

508
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:43,000
I bet she stepped on any poor girl
that got in her way.

509
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:47,460
- So you asked her out and she said no?
- That has nothing to do with it.

510
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:50,000
Right.
Come on, Dewey.

511
00:38:50,250 --> 00:38:52,460
Scene 50.

512
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:56,800
"Dewey Saves the Day."

513
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:27,460
She's so focused on success
that she never thinks...

514
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,540
about who she's hurting
to get it.

515
00:39:29,790 --> 00:39:31,750
And you saved her life, like,
how many times?

516
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,840
Gale wants the whole world
to love her.

517
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,760
One person's never enough.
She's a dreamer.

518
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:40,220
-No, she's a narcissistic, psycho bitch.
-No, she's not.

519
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:42,510
She's got a good heart.
She does.

520
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:49,100
She just hides it away because
she thinks people see that as weak.

521
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,820
This is a good picture of you.
You look just like her.

522
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:55,230
God, Dewey.

523
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:58,530
You make it sound like
you're still in love with her.

524
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:00,620
And I left out the part
that she's cruel...

525
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:06,870
and selfish,
obsessive and annoying.

526
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:10,120
We have one Gale Weathers here.
We don't need two.

527
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:15,340
Hey, Dewdrop,
got your girlfriend out here.

528
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:20,640
Look who I found slinkin'
around the yard. The nightly news.

529
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,800
I wasn't slinking.
I was walking.

530
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,430
You were eaves dropping
at the bedroom window.

531
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,270
Yeah, a bedroom that
you seemed awfully at home in.

532
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,150
All right, let's talk.

533
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:34,400
Come on.

534
00:40:34,650 --> 00:40:37,400
- What's this about, Gale?
- Did you know they released Roman?

535
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:39,400
Sarah's call didn't come
from his cell phone.

536
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:43,320
- Where did it come from then?
- A cloned cell phone. It's untraceable.

537
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:46,080
Well, thanks for the update, Gale.
Why don't you just go back home?

538
00:40:46,330 --> 00:40:50,540
Dewey, wait a minute.
Just wait one second.

539
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:53,380
How old do you think
Maureen Prescott is in this picture?

540
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,130
- Nineteen, twenty.
- That's what I thought,
so I checked it out.

541
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:59,840
I cannot find any information about
her at this age. I mean, nothing.

542
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:03,680
She lived in Woodsboro her whole life.
Someone there must know something.

543
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,260
Almost her whole life.
Two years before...

544
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:08,980
she met Sidney's father,
she left Woodsboro.

545
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,640
No one has any idea
where she went or what she did.

546
00:41:11,890 --> 00:41:16,110
I mean, it's-it's like she fell into
a black hole, Dewey! She vanished!

547
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,190
- So?
- So?

548
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,030
Why is the killer
leaving pictures of-of Maureen?

549
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:25,990
And why these pictures at-at--
at that point in her life?

550
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,290
I don't know! If I thought
like a homicidal maniac...

551
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,290
then I'd know how
a homicidal maniac thinks.

552
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,300
What?

553
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:43,970
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer?

554
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:50,470
Look at the buildings.
The second story. There and there.

555
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:53,640
It's the same!
It's the same street 28 years ago.

556
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:58,320
Oh, my God. Maureen Prescott was
at the back lot at Sunrise Studios!

557
00:41:58,570 --> 00:42:02,240
- Oh, my God.
- I gotta make some calls.

558
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,920
Steven Stone
Protection Services.

559
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,000
Stone, where are you?

560
00:42:19,250 --> 00:42:21,800
I'm just checking
your tin can, Dewdrop.

561
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:23,800
Well, come back inside
and stay with Jennifer.

562
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:26,140
Something's happened.
I have to go to the police.

563
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,560
Is that an order, Dewdrop? 'Cause
Steven Stone doesn't work for you.

564
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:35,440
Get back in the house, Stone.
Would I call you if it wasn 't important?

565
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:37,650
- What are you doing in there anyway?
- Me?

566
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,150
I'm just checking to make sure
there's no killer in here...

567
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,070
waitin' to off you
like he did your little sister.

568
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,240
What did you say?
I can't believe you said that.

569
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:48,700
That makes me...

570
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:52,620
angry!

571
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:55,870
Fucker!

572
00:43:07,550 --> 00:43:11,060
Gotta call Kincaid.

573
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,310
Dewey, where is everybody?

574
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,860
- Oh, God.
-Jennifer?

575
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:31,580
Angelina?
Tom?

576
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:36,290
Oh, my God!
What happened?

577
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:42,040
Don't do that.
I'm overreacting.

578
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,090
Dewdrop?

579
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:54,810
- Stone?
- Oh, my God!

580
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:57,390
Oh, God, Stone!

581
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:00,900
Oh, God!

582
00:44:04,070 --> 00:44:09,450
- Dewey, is he dead?
- Yeah.

583
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:13,780
Everyone back inside!

584
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:19,620
It's all right.
Don't panic.

585
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:24,050
Okay, outside. Everyone,
stay together and try to remain calm.

586
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,130
A phone!

587
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:28,760
- It's not mine.
- It's not mine.

588
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:32,680
Shit!
It's the fax.

589
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:42,270
"Interior, Jennifer's house. Living
room, night." It's a script page.

590
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:46,400
- W-W-What's it say?
- "With the bodyguard stabbed to death,
the five stand trapped.

591
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:48,860
- He's rewriting the movie.
- As the killer waits outside...

592
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:51,070
suddenly the fax machine
sends news of their fates."

593
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,200
It's a trick!
Everybody, outside!

594
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:55,530
- Outside where he can
pick us off one by one?
- Shut up!

595
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:57,790
"The killer prepares to grant
mercy to only one of them."

596
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,210
Don't you get it? The killer says he's
outside because he wants us here inside.

597
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,580
- Which one is it?
- Come on!

598
00:45:03,830 --> 00:45:05,840
"Who will survive? Is it Jennifer?
Tom? Angelina? Dewey? Gale?

599
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:09,630
- The killer will give mercy to--"
- Everyone outside!

600
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:13,050
He grants mercy to who?
I wanna know what happens!

601
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,850
- I wanna know what happens!
- Wait for the fucking movie!

602
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,930
- I've gotta know! I'm goin' back in!
- No.

603
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:20,640
All right, everyone, back.
Stay together.

604
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,940
- What's it say?
- "And the...

605
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:25,190
killer will give mercy to...

606
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,940
- whoever--"
- Whoever?

607
00:45:28,190 --> 00:45:30,570
Whoever?

608
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:32,450
Piece of shit.

609
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:38,160
"Whoever--
Whoever smells the--"

610
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:56,510
I can't stop
rolling down the hill!

611
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:09,820
Gale!Jennifer!

612
00:46:10,070 --> 00:46:11,860
- Dewey!
- Dewey!

613
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,990
Dewey, where are you?

614
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:17,990
Over here, Dewey!

615
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:24,500
- Dewey!
- Gale!

616
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:28,460
Gale, behind you!

617
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:40,930
Dewey!
Are you all right?

618
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,230
Yeah, never been better.

619
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,900
Yeah, I'm all right.
Where'd he go?

620
00:46:47,150 --> 00:46:51,530
- He must've rolled under the car.
- All right, stay close.

621
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:01,990
Is he back there?

622
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:04,870
- No.
- No?

623
00:47:05,120 --> 00:47:09,670
He's fast.
Could've sworn I hit him.

624
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,300
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

625
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,590
Thanks for saving me.

626
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,350
Ah, it's habit.

627
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,560
Oh, God.

628
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:32,280
What the fuck happened to you?

629
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,860
-Jennifer, wait a minute.
- Who gave you a place to stay?

630
00:47:35,110 --> 00:47:38,360
-Who are you supposed to be protecting?
-Jennifer!

631
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:42,620
Hey!

632
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:50,250
My lawyer liked that.

633
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:54,340
Not as much as I did.

634
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,140
- Angelina?
- Tom was in the house.

635
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:08,100
- How'd you end up way over there?
- Oh, my God! Tom was in the house!

636
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,730
- Are we safe?
- Safe from who?

637
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:21,740
Wait a second!

638
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:28,500
Another picture.

639
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:36,050
Whoever it is is now taking credit
for Maureen Prescott's murder.

640
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:39,220
But we know who killed Maureen
Prescott. Billy Loomis and Stu Macher.

641
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:41,680
-I mean, they even told Sidney
how they did it.
- Yeah, but if I'm not mistaken...

642
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,010
you said in your book that
Sidney got it wrong once before.

643
00:48:44,260 --> 00:48:46,850
She accused Cotton Weary
of murdering her mother.

644
00:48:47,100 --> 00:48:49,940
And he was sent away for it.
Maybe there is a third killer.

645
00:48:50,190 --> 00:48:52,100
Sidney might know something.

646
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:54,730
I told you.
I don't know where Sidney is.

647
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,400
And even if there was a third killer,
Sidney doesn't know about it.

648
00:48:57,650 --> 00:49:00,780
That is for me to decide.
I need to talk to her, Mr. Riley.
She is a key element in this case.

649
00:49:01,030 --> 00:49:03,120
I have a press conference in an hour.
I need to explain...

650
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:05,660
why there are three dead celebrities
and a bodyguard.

651
00:49:05,910 --> 00:49:08,500
And a very angry mayor.

652
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,580
Okay, look, we all know this has
something to do with Stab 3.

653
00:49:10,830 --> 00:49:13,670
But what we do not know is why
the killer keeps leaving pictures...

654
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,130
of Maureen Prescott
taken over 25 years ago.

655
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,970
And the photographs taken at the same
studio Stab 3 is shooting out of.

656
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:20,680
What does this
have to do with Sid?

657
00:49:20,930 --> 00:49:23,470
Who knows more about Maureen
Prescott than her own daughter?

658
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:27,270
Well, Sid's dad couldn't help you,
and he was married to Maureen.

659
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,270
What's your problem?

660
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:33,900
Last night you were almost charcoal.
You gonna help us or what?

661
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:36,110
Do you wanna have this
conversation with a polygraph?

662
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:41,740
- Is that a threat, Detective?
- When it's a threat, you'll know it.

663
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,120
- Was that a threat?
- Boys, boys.

664
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,660
Why don't we compare
our gun calibres later?

665
00:49:46,910 --> 00:49:50,080
- The issue is Maureen Prescott.
- Wrong. The issue is Sidney Prescott.

666
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:54,040
And either Mr Riley is going
to obstructjustice or he's going
to put me in touch with her.

667
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:59,510
So, where is she?

668
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,220
Hi, you've reached the machine.
You can leave a message.
Talk as long as you want.

669
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:08,100
Sid, it's me.
This is the fifth time I've called.

670
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:12,270
Please pick up.
I wanna make sure you're...

671
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,900
okay.

672
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,070
- Sid!
- Dewey!

673
00:50:19,730 --> 00:50:21,820
What are you doing down here?

674
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:25,110
Actually, what was I doing up there?

675
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:28,450
-Jesus, Dewey. Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, I'm all right.

676
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,500
- Is she all right?
- Hey, you know Gale.

677
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:34,330
It'd take a direct hit.

678
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:38,880
So the news said this was the precinct.
Who's this guy Kincaid?

679
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,960
Come here.
I told you to stay hidden.

680
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:45,640
- It's not safe for you to be here.
- The killer called me.

681
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:48,010
- What?
- Yeah, he found me.

682
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:53,640
I'm no more safe there than I am here,
and at least here I'm not alone.

683
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:57,770
Okay, come on.

684
00:50:58,190 --> 00:51:00,320
- Detective Kincaid?
- Yeah.

685
00:51:00,570 --> 00:51:02,990
There's someone here
who wants to help.

686
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:05,740
Oh, my God.
Sidney.

687
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:07,910
Is the man fast or what?

688
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,500
- Hi.
- Hi, Gale.

689
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:15,790
- I'm glad you're all right.
- Thank you.

690
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:20,590
- Sid, this is Detective Kincaid.
- Nice to finally meet you, Sidney.

691
00:51:22,170 --> 00:51:24,010
- The killer called her.
- What? When?

692
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:26,510
- What did he say?
- Oh, you know, the usual small talk.

693
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,010
What's new? How you been?
How do you wanna die?

694
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:32,140
Sidney, do you have any idea
how he could've gotten your number?

695
00:51:32,390 --> 00:51:35,350
He could have monitored her calls on a
scanner. Did you call her from the set?

696
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:38,560
- No.
- Do you have her number
stored in your memory?

697
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:42,820
- Phone memory!
- Oh. Yeah, guess I do.

698
00:51:43,070 --> 00:51:46,950
- Has anyone else ever used your phone?
-Just Jennifer.

699
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,070
And you.

700
00:51:49,320 --> 00:51:54,040
Hey, I'm the cop here.
You're in my office, Riley.

701
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:01,380
The killer leaves a photograph
after each murder, Sidney.

702
00:52:01,630 --> 00:52:04,590
They were taken in Hollywood at the same
studio that they're shooting Stab 3.

703
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,680
Why didn't you tell me?
This is my mother, Dewey.

704
00:52:07,930 --> 00:52:10,470
- Why didn't you say something?
- I was afraid they were bait.

705
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,680
Something to, you know,
trick you out of hiding.

706
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:16,480
Sidney, was she an actress or a model?
Because they look a lot
like publicity stills.

707
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:19,770
I, uh, don't know.

708
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,900
Detective, I wanna see
this place in the pictures.

709
00:52:23,150 --> 00:52:28,610
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely.

710
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,120
- Slow it down.
- Sorry.

711
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:36,870
Watch the fuckin' aliens.

712
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,670
I'm gonna go talk to
the studio brass about those photos.

713
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,750
Yeah, right.
I know where you're goin'.

714
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,130
- Yeah, keep an eye on Sidney.
- I know where you're goin'.

715
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,920
You're gonna get her some flowers
and candy, huh? Huh?

716
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,010
- Gimme a break.
- Yeah, gimme a call.

717
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:53,760
Just keep your eye on her.

718
00:52:59,770 --> 00:53:03,900
That stairwell over there, that's
where one of the pictures was taken.

719
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,730
God. I can't believe
she never mentioned any of this.

720
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,280
- She probably just--
- Dewey!

721
00:53:08,530 --> 00:53:10,070
- Sorry.
- Martha!

722
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:12,200
- Oh, my God, Sid.
- Hey, hold it right there! Hey!
- Don't shoot!

723
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:14,580
- I'm only 17.
- It's okay. We know her.

724
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:16,620
We do?

725
00:53:16,870 --> 00:53:18,870
Tell me that's his ex-girlfriend,
I'll shoot myself.

726
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:21,620
- It's Martha Meeks, Randy's sister.
- Randy's sister?

727
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:24,340
- Yeah, can't you tell?
- We miss you in Woodsboro, guys.

728
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:30,260
- Martha, what are you doing here?
- There's something you guys should see.

729
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,510
Told ya I'd make
a movie someday. Huh?

730
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:39,980
- Oh, my God.
- Well, if you're watching this tape...

731
00:53:40,230 --> 00:53:42,060
it means, as I feared, I did not
survive these killings...

732
00:53:42,310 --> 00:53:44,900
here at Windsor College,
and that giving up my virginity...

733
00:53:45,150 --> 00:53:47,780
to Karen Kolchakat the video store
was probably not a good idea.

734
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:50,240
- Karen Kolchak?
- Yes, Karen Kolchak.

735
00:53:50,490 --> 00:53:52,990
- "Creepy Karen"?
- Shut up! She's a sweet person, okay?

736
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:55,740
We were workin'late. We were puttin'
away some videos in the porno section...

737
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,540
and, you know, shit happens.

738
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,000
- Open the door, Randy!
- Fifteen minutes.

739
00:54:02,250 --> 00:54:04,790
- It's my room too!
- Paul,15 minutes.

740
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,800
I'm leaving my legacy.

741
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:11,840
Fifteen minutes, Paul!
Damn! Anyway...

742
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:16,350
the reason I'm here is to help you so
that my death will not be in vain.

743
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:21,680
That my life's work will help save some
other poor soul from getting mutilated.

744
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:24,310
If this killer does come back
and he's for real...

745
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:26,480
there are a few things
that you gotta remember.

746
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,730
Is this simply another sequel?
Well, if it is, same rules apply.

747
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,320
But here's the critical thing.
If you find yourself dealing...

748
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:34,860
with an unexpected back-story
and ap reponderance...

749
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,700
of exposition,
then the sequel rules do not apply.

750
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,450
Because you're not dealing with
the sequel. You are dealing with...

751
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:44,750
the concluding chapter
of a trilogy.

752
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:47,500
- Trilogy.
- That's right. It's
a rarity in the horror field...

753
00:54:47,750 --> 00:54:50,380
but it does exist, and it is
a force to be reckoned with.

754
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:54,090
Because true trilogies are all about
going back to the beginning...

755
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,470
and discovering something
that wasn 't true from the get-go.

756
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,220
Godfather, Jedi,
all revealed something...

757
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:01,680
that we thought was true
that wasn 't true.

758
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:04,140
So if it is a trilogy
you are dealing with...

759
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:07,560
here are some super
trilogy rules.

760
00:55:07,810 --> 00:55:09,440
One: You've got a killer
who's gonna be superhuman.

761
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:11,530
Stabbing him won't work.
Shooting him won't work.

762
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,070
Basically, in the third one, you've
gotta cryogenically freeze his head...

763
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,990
decapitate him or blowhim up.

764
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:19,160
Number two: Anyone, including
the main character, can die.

765
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:22,580
This means you, Sid.
I'm sorry. It's the final chapter.

766
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:25,290
It could be fuckin' Reservoir Dogs
by the time this thing is through.

767
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,290
Number three: The past will
come back to bite you in the ass.

768
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,380
Whatever you think you know
about the past, forget it.

769
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:32,800
The past is not at rest!
Any sins you think...

770
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:38,340
were committed in the past are about
to break out and destroy you.

771
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:42,560
So in closing,
let me say...

772
00:55:42,810 --> 00:55:45,310
goodluck, Godspeed...

773
00:55:45,560 --> 00:55:49,560
and for some of you,
I'll see you soon.

774
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:53,110
'Cause the rules say some of you
ain't gonna make it. I didn't.

775
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,910
Not if you're watching this tape.

776
00:56:02,870 --> 00:56:07,250
Thank you. And you be careful.
Say hi to your folks for me.

777
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:09,750
You be careful too, Sid.

778
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,550
- Bye, Dewey. Come visit us soon.
- I will, Martha.

779
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,800
- Thank you.
- Bye.

780
00:56:18,930 --> 00:56:21,390
I've got an idea.
I'll hook up with you guys later.

781
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,930
- Do you want us to come with you?
- I work better alone.

782
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:27,980
Why don't you try to figure out where
those other pictures were taken.

783
00:56:28,230 --> 00:56:32,520
- I can see nothing's changed.
- No.

784
00:56:37,450 --> 00:56:40,950
Oh, shit.

785
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,620
Hello!

786
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,550
-Jeez.
- What the hell are you doing?

787
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,760
Being Gale Weathers.
What the hell are you doing?

788
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,970
- I am Gale Weathers.
- Here's how I see it.

789
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:03,010
I've got no house, no bodyguard,
no movie, and I'm being stalked.

790
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,430
Because someone wants to kill me?
No, because someone wants to kill you.

791
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,810
So now, starting now,
I go where you go.

792
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:10,480
That way, if someone wants
to kill me, I'll be with you.

793
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:12,860
And since they really want to kill you,
they won't kill me, they'll kill you.

794
00:57:13,110 --> 00:57:14,770
- Make sense?
- None.

795
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:16,900
You know, in the movies,
I play you as being much smarter.

796
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:20,490
And as a sane person.
Foryou, that must be quite a stretch.

797
00:57:20,740 --> 00:57:22,740
- That's funny.
- Ha!

798
00:57:22,990 --> 00:57:24,830
- Need to get in that building?
- Yeah.

799
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:26,910
- Is there a story in that building?
- Maybe.

800
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:30,920
Gale Weathers would find a way.

801
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:35,210
Bitch. All right, wait.Just--

802
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:38,710
Don't tell me what to do.

803
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:46,600
Basements, wow.

804
00:57:46,850 --> 00:57:48,770
Basements creep me out.

805
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:52,520
You'd make
a fascinating interview.

806
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,940
Hello?

807
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:09,080
Hi. Excuse me.
I am Gale Weathers...

808
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:13,500
and I'm here researching
with the police this photo.

809
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,130
It was taken at the studio.
Her name is Maureen Prescott.

810
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:19,210
Back then it was probably Roberts.

811
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,800
- Hey, are you--
- No.

812
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:24,180
- But you look just--
- Like her?

813
00:58:24,430 --> 00:58:26,760
- I've been hearing it all my life.
- It's uncanny.

814
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:30,100
I was up for Princess Leia.
I was this close.

815
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:33,020
So, who gets it?
The one who sleeps with George Lucas.

816
00:58:33,270 --> 00:58:35,900
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up
a-a sore subject for you.

817
00:58:36,150 --> 00:58:38,230
Sure, you didn't.
None of them did.

818
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,860
So, how can I help you? Or do you want
me to tell you who you look like?

819
00:58:43,110 --> 00:58:45,570
How about some information
on Maureen Roberts?

820
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:48,410
I don't work for the cops, sweetie.
I work for the studio.

821
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:53,620
Really? Well,
would you work for...

822
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,630
the president?

823
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,630
The president of the studio.

824
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:06,260
Fifty dollars? Who are you?
A reporter for Woodsboro High?

825
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,560
It's worth two grand.

826
00:59:14,810 --> 00:59:18,650
Are you gonna help
Gale Weathers or not?

827
00:59:19,610 --> 00:59:21,780
I know every face in here.

828
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:24,320
I got a respect
for the unknown actor.

829
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:29,950
If they're looking for Maureen Roberts,
they're never gonna find her.

830
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:33,410
Rina Reynolds they will.

831
00:59:33,660 --> 00:59:37,420
Rina Reynolds.
Stage name.

832
00:59:37,670 --> 00:59:41,340
You should talk,Judy Jurgenstern.

833
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:47,050
What are these movies?
Amazombies, Space Psycho...

834
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,140
Creatures from the San Andreas Fault.

835
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:52,520
Horror pictures
back in Milton's heyday.

836
00:59:52,770 --> 00:59:54,850
- Back in what?
- Back in what?
-John Milton.

837
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:59,400
The horror producer?
Those were his movies.

838
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,640
Come on, Sid.

839
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:01,460
Oh, my God!
Sidney Prescott!

840
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:05,250
Oh, my God! I'm Angelina Tyler.
I'm you! I mean, I'm not.

841
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:09,590
I mean, I was.

842
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:14,970
I-I thought-- Well,
if there's no movie...

843
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:17,180
then no one would care
if I took some souvenirs.

844
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:20,440
Souvenirs?

845
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:23,150
I may never win another role,
so these may be...

846
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:26,190
my only memories,
you know, of Hollywood.

847
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:29,860
I-I know it's weird 'cause
it's your life and all, but...

848
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:33,200
I wanted to make you proud, Sidney.

849
01:01:33,450 --> 01:01:37,540
Oh. Well,
I'm sure I would've been.

850
01:01:37,790 --> 01:01:40,160
The real Sidney.
The real person.

851
01:01:40,410 --> 01:01:43,210
I wish--

852
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:47,460
I wish it would've worked out.

853
01:01:57,010 --> 01:02:00,520
Hey--

854
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:08,530
Angelina?

855
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:24,790
Hello?

856
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:44,790
Close call.

857
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,920
What are you doing here?

858
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:50,750
It occurred to me that I've never
snuck through your bedroom window.

859
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,050
See what you do to me?

860
01:03:54,300 --> 01:03:57,050
What have I done to you?

861
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,470
About the, uh, sex stuff?

862
01:03:59,720 --> 01:04:02,220
You know, I'm not trying
to rush you at all.

863
01:04:02,470 --> 01:04:07,520
Would you settle for
a PG-13 relationship?

864
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,100
Dewey!

865
01:06:18,990 --> 01:06:22,740
Dewey!

866
01:06:25,910 --> 01:06:30,000
Sidney, I'm in here.

867
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:37,840
Over here.

868
01:06:38,090 --> 01:06:42,680
Yes. Mother will protect you
from the bogeyman.

869
01:06:42,930 --> 01:06:46,970
Come into the bedroom.

870
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:50,890
Hide in Mommy's bed.

871
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:54,850
I lied, Sidney.

872
01:06:55,100 --> 01:06:56,650
I can't protect you at all.

873
01:06:56,900 --> 01:07:00,820
You don't deserve to be protected!
You didn't protect me!

874
01:07:01,070 --> 01:07:03,530
We did your mom a favour, Sid.
That woman was a slutbag whore...

875
01:07:03,780 --> 01:07:05,990
who flashed her shit all over town
like she was Sharon Stone.

876
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,620
'Cause let's face it, Sidney,
your mother was no Sharon Stone.

877
01:07:09,870 --> 01:07:12,620
- Sidney's mother was fucking my father.
- Sid, where are you?

878
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:16,080
Dewey!
Dewey, help me!

879
01:07:16,330 --> 01:07:20,170
Sidney? Give Mommy a kiss
and we'll make up.

880
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:23,420
- No!
- Sidney!

881
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:32,430
Sid!

882
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:34,690
Sid, are you okay?
What happened?

883
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:38,610
The killer's in the house, Dewey.
He's upstairs.

884
01:07:39,070 --> 01:07:43,360
- And my mother--
- Let's go, let's go.

885
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:46,280
I heard her voice.
I saw her, Dewey.

886
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:49,450
- Upstairs. Come on, let's go.
- It's okay, Sid.

887
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,830
You weren't supposed
to go in that house.

888
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,000
It's all set up for the murder scene.

889
01:07:54,250 --> 01:07:56,080
- I'm sorry you had to see that.
- He was in there, Dewey.

890
01:07:56,330 --> 01:08:00,880
- He was in there, I swear, I swear.
- You know I believe you.

891
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:05,170
- What happened?
- Kincaid, hey.

892
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:08,680
There's nobody up here.

893
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:16,440
Come on.

894
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:19,900
- Come on.
- Okay, so I stole the mask.

895
01:08:20,150 --> 01:08:23,360
Whatever. I didn't know you got
the gas chamber for that.

896
01:08:23,610 --> 01:08:26,200
- You stole the mask?
- I took it.

897
01:08:26,450 --> 01:08:29,570
- You took the mask
or you stole the mask?
- I-I took it as like a souvenir.

898
01:08:29,820 --> 01:08:32,240
- Don't look at me. I didn't take shit.
- I know he was there.

899
01:08:32,490 --> 01:08:34,410
I am not dreaming,
I am not crazy.

900
01:08:34,660 --> 01:08:37,870
- He was there in Woodsboro.
- That's not Woodsboro, Sidney.

901
01:08:38,120 --> 01:08:42,710
You know what I mean. But he was there.
He or she, or whoever this is.

902
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:45,510
We're gonna take you back
to the station, keep you under watch.

903
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:48,090
Put you in a safe house.
Whatever it takes.

904
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:51,850
Come on.

905
01:08:51,850 --> 01:08:54,560
It's all right, Sid.
We all believe you.

906
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:58,480
- He's watching.
- And he wants you.

907
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,190
- Hey, Dew.
- Dew.
- Come on.

908
01:09:03,440 --> 01:09:06,070
- We have to go catch up with Sid.
- Take a look at this first.

909
01:09:06,320 --> 01:09:08,240
- Someone we know?
- Where'd you get this?

910
01:09:08,490 --> 01:09:11,870
- We got it. Archives.
- Sidney's mother was an actress.
Three movies.

911
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:16,660
-Horror movies.
-Wanna know who produced all three?
-Who?

912
01:09:16,910 --> 01:09:18,790
- There'll be other movies, Roman.
- Not only did they--

913
01:09:19,040 --> 01:09:22,000
did they kill the film,
but they killed my cast.

914
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:25,340
Now, nobody's gonna wanna work
with me. Variety called me a pariah.

915
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:29,090
I don't even know what a pariah is.
Why-Why couldn't someone
have killed the cast from Stab 1?

916
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,720
Huh? Or Stab 2? Why me?
What--John, what did we do wrong?

917
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:34,260
Hollywood is full of criminals
whose careers are flourishing.

918
01:09:34,510 --> 01:09:36,720
I'm not a criminal!
I was questioned.

919
01:09:36,970 --> 01:09:38,810
Yeah, but that's all.
I was questioned. That's it.

920
01:09:39,060 --> 01:09:41,900
- That's good foryour mystique.
- You think it will help me get work?

921
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:44,110
Roman. John.

922
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:47,280
Jennifer, and guests.
To what do I owe the honour?

923
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:51,320
- Rina Reynolds.
- Rina Reynolds? Who's Rina Reynolds?

924
01:09:51,570 --> 01:09:55,030
Why don't you head to the house?
Tell everybody not to cut
the cake without me.

925
01:09:55,280 --> 01:09:57,580
- Oh, God, I forgot. Your birthday.
- Yeah.

926
01:09:57,830 --> 01:10:00,580
- Happy birthday, Roman.
- Yeah, as if life isn't tragic enough.

927
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:05,540
Shut the doors behind you, please.

928
01:10:06,460 --> 01:10:08,760
So, you knew
Sidney Prescott's mother.

929
01:10:09,010 --> 01:10:12,220
- Who?
- Rina Reynolds?

930
01:10:12,470 --> 01:10:15,640
Do you know how many actors have
worked for me? Hundreds. Thousands.

931
01:10:15,890 --> 01:10:19,180
- He didn't say she was an actor.
- Good catch.

932
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:21,690
- So what's the point?
- Uh, no point.

933
01:10:21,940 --> 01:10:24,730
I'm just gonna give, uh,
Detective Kincaid a call.

934
01:10:24,980 --> 01:10:28,730
I remember. She was a bit player
in a couple of my movies.

935
01:10:28,990 --> 01:10:31,400
- A nobody. So what does it matter?
- Oh, come on.

936
01:10:31,650 --> 01:10:35,200
You have made millions
off the story of her murder.

937
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:38,290
You're obsessed with her,
and you're obsessed with her daughter!

938
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:41,660
All right, easy, Geraldo.
Why don't you tell us the truth?

939
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:45,920
What the hell are you guys getting at?
I make horror films, that's what I do.

940
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:48,170
The studio came to me with Stab.

941
01:10:48,420 --> 01:10:51,130
They came to me.
Check it out.

942
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:54,010
- But you knew who she was.
- When we did the first Stab...

943
01:10:54,260 --> 01:10:56,470
I realized I had known
Maureen Prescott before.

944
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,020
I mean, as Rina.

945
01:10:59,270 --> 01:11:03,020
I couldn't tell anyone.
Can you imagine the press?

946
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:05,610
And now?
I mean, murders on your set.

947
01:11:05,860 --> 01:11:08,190
- And-And still you say nothing?
- Get real.

948
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:10,820
- That would make me a suspect.
-Just because you knew her?

949
01:11:11,070 --> 01:11:13,360
- Yeah.
- I don't think so.

950
01:11:13,610 --> 01:11:17,370
Just what did happen to Maureen
when she was in Hollywood?

951
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,700
Now, you listen to me, Lois Lane.
Let it go. It's dead and buried.

952
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:24,170
How would you like to see it
dug up on national TV?

953
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:27,920
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

954
01:11:29,130 --> 01:11:32,340
It was in the '70s.
Everything was different.

955
01:11:32,590 --> 01:11:36,300
I was well-known for my parties.
Rina knew what they were.

956
01:11:36,550 --> 01:11:40,890
It was for girls like her to meet men.
Men who could get them parts...

957
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:42,980
if they made
the right impression.

958
01:11:43,230 --> 01:11:45,390
Nothing happened to her
that she didn't invite...

959
01:11:45,650 --> 01:11:48,860
in one way or another
no matter what she said afterwards.

960
01:11:49,110 --> 01:11:52,280
- Are you saying she--
- I'm saying things got out of hand.

961
01:11:52,530 --> 01:11:56,410
Maybe they did take advantage of her.
You know, Maybe the sad truth is...

962
01:11:56,660 --> 01:12:00,200
this is not the city
for innocents.

963
01:12:00,450 --> 01:12:03,370
No charges were brought.
And the bottom line is...

964
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:06,170
Rina Reynolds
wouldn't play by the rules.

965
01:12:06,420 --> 01:12:08,580
You wanna get ahead in Hollywood?

966
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:13,710
You gotta play the game, or go home.

967
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,850
What do you know
about trilogies?

968
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:24,480
- You mean, like movie trilogies?
- You seem to like movies, Detective.

969
01:12:24,730 --> 01:12:29,060
Call me Mark, would you? 'Cause
I'm gonna keep calling you Sidney.

970
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:33,150
I'll call you Mark when
you catch the killer, Detective.

971
01:12:33,900 --> 01:12:37,950
All I know about movie trilogies
is that in the third one...

972
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,030
all bets are off.

973
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:44,080
- Did you request this case?
- No. They tend to put me...

974
01:12:44,330 --> 01:12:46,160
on the ones that deal
with the business.

975
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:49,500
I grew up here,
and I know my way around the studios.

976
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,960
Huh.

977
01:12:52,210 --> 01:12:55,590
Must be exciting.
Beautiful place, beautiful people.

978
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:59,590
To me, Hollywood is about death.

979
01:13:00,090 --> 01:13:02,640
Excuse me?

980
01:13:02,890 --> 01:13:06,230
I'm a homicide detective, remember?

981
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,190
And when you see what I see
day in and day out...

982
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,860
the violence
that people do to each other...

983
01:13:12,110 --> 01:13:13,940
you get haunted.

984
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:17,700
I think you know about that.

985
01:13:18,450 --> 01:13:20,660
What do you mean?

986
01:13:20,910 --> 01:13:23,910
I know what it's like
to see ghosts that don't go away.

987
01:13:24,160 --> 01:13:29,460
To be watching a scary movie in
your head, whether you want to or not.

988
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:34,550
Watching it alone.

989
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:37,920
Ghosts are tough.
You can't shoot ghosts.

990
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:40,970
Can't arrest ghosts.

991
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:44,640
But the best way to stop being
haunted is to be with people.

992
01:13:44,890 --> 01:13:46,810
You're here, you're not hiding.

993
01:13:47,060 --> 01:13:52,020
You've done the right thing,
Miss Prescott.

994
01:13:55,020 --> 01:13:58,860
What did you know about your mother?

995
01:14:01,990 --> 01:14:04,530
I always thought
I had the perfect mom.

996
01:14:04,780 --> 01:14:08,290
Perfect family.

997
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:14,290
Till I found out I was wrong.
She, um--

998
01:14:15,590 --> 01:14:20,550
She had a secret life, and I tried
to understand that, and, um...

999
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:26,470
soon as I thought that I had,
more secrets.

1000
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:31,560
I don't know who my mom was.

1001
01:14:31,810 --> 01:14:35,650
You know who she was to you.

1002
01:14:38,690 --> 01:14:40,650
Here's the deal.
I'm off to search the set.

1003
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:45,030
I think what you saw is real.
That's the good news.

1004
01:14:45,280 --> 01:14:47,370
- How is that good news?
- Because that means...

1005
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:50,580
that we're dealing with
an ordinary flesh-and-blood killer.

1006
01:14:50,830 --> 01:14:54,250
- And I know how
to handle guys like that.
- Oh, yeah? How?

1007
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:58,960
Catch him or kill him.

1008
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:04,930
Hey, Detective.

1009
01:15:05,180 --> 01:15:09,180
What's your favourite
scary movie?

1010
01:15:11,480 --> 01:15:14,980
My life.

1011
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,030
Mine too.

1012
01:15:19,780 --> 01:15:21,650
We have to think.
Strategize.

1013
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:24,660
- Milton's the key to everything.
- He's a pervert, he's not a killer.

1014
01:15:24,910 --> 01:15:27,620
He's gotta be involved somehow.
We should follow him.

1015
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:29,700
We're gonna go back to the precinct and
we're gonna tell Kincaid and Sidney...

1016
01:15:29,950 --> 01:15:32,000
what we found out.

1017
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:35,580
My Gale would be much more aggressive.
My Gale would suspect everybody.

1018
01:15:35,830 --> 01:15:39,590
- My Gale would--
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

1019
01:15:41,210 --> 01:15:43,760
- Riley here.
- Dewey, it's Sidney.
- Hey, Sid.

1020
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:45,930
- I'm with Gale.
We're on our way to see you.
- No.

1021
01:15:46,180 --> 01:15:49,510
Listen, I'm not at the station.
John Milton called me and said
he had something to tell me.

1022
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:52,060
Something about my mom.
I'm going to meet him at his house.

1023
01:15:52,310 --> 01:15:54,480
Wait, Sid, I'm not so sure
that's a good idea.

1024
01:15:54,730 --> 01:15:57,560
It's okay. Kincaid's with me.
I've got official big-time...

1025
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:01,070
L.A.P.D. protection, but
I'd feel better if you were there.

1026
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:05,400
- We're on our way, but still, Sid--
- Thanks.

1027
01:16:05,660 --> 01:16:10,950
- What?
- Looks like we're going
to that party after all.

1028
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:23,090
Hey, guys. Come on in.
Join the party.

1029
01:16:23,340 --> 01:16:25,220
Yeah, well, actually,
we're here to see Sidney.

1030
01:16:25,470 --> 01:16:27,510
- Really? Sidney's here.
- Where?

1031
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:30,930
- Where's Sidney?
- She's right there!

1032
01:16:31,180 --> 01:16:34,480
Jesus!
Not "Sidney," Sidney.

1033
01:16:34,730 --> 01:16:38,100
- Like I'm "Gale" and she's Gale.
- Sidney Prescott?

1034
01:16:38,350 --> 01:16:41,070
- Yeah.
- No, I'd never invite her here.

1035
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:44,900
- She's on her way.
- Well, the more the merrier.

1036
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:48,860
God, this house is incredible.

1037
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,990
-It's old Hollywood.
-Yeah. Could the dude have more money?

1038
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:55,120
Supposedly, Milton has
a secret screening room...

1039
01:16:55,370 --> 01:16:57,210
that was like the scene
back in the '70s, you know.

1040
01:16:57,460 --> 01:17:01,590
It was, like, drinks and drugs
and girls and movies and shit.

1041
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:04,510
Wow! Wish I could've seen it.

1042
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,630
Big old screening room
shouldn't be too hard to find.

1043
01:17:06,880 --> 01:17:08,720
I'm gonna go--
I'm gonna go check this place out.

1044
01:17:08,970 --> 01:17:12,350
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Just one damn minute.
There's a psycho killer on the loose.

1045
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:15,060
And you want to go traipsing around
this gigantic mansion?

1046
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:17,640
Have you ever actually seen
the Stab movies? Every time...

1047
01:17:17,890 --> 01:17:20,440
this dude enters a room,
he ends up a goddam shish kebab.

1048
01:17:20,690 --> 01:17:23,690
- I'll go with you, Roman.
- There you go. You guys wanna come?

1049
01:17:23,940 --> 01:17:27,860
It'll be okay.
We're gonna stick together.

1050
01:17:28,110 --> 01:17:31,620
-You're not stickin'. Wait up.
-We're gonna stay here and wait for Sid.

1051
01:17:31,870 --> 01:17:34,990
We'll be right back!

1052
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:38,290
If-If you were a screening room...

1053
01:17:38,540 --> 01:17:42,040
where would you be?

1054
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:46,840
I bet in the basement.

1055
01:17:48,050 --> 01:17:52,050
I don't like basements.

1056
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:57,980
Ooh, it's spooky.

1057
01:18:09,110 --> 01:18:11,070
- Ooh, Weredad.
- Damn, it's dark in here.

1058
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:13,870
- I loved that movie.
- Forget the movie!
What if Milton's crazy...

1059
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,620
and he's gonna jump outta his screening
room with a sling blade or something?

1060
01:18:16,870 --> 01:18:20,370
- He won't.
- You sure about that?

1061
01:18:24,710 --> 01:18:28,170
- What's down there?
- Zombies and aliens.

1062
01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:30,840
You know, what you look like
without make-up, Jennifer.

1063
01:18:31,090 --> 01:18:34,220
Jesus. Stop pretending
I wasn't the best you've ever had.

1064
01:18:34,470 --> 01:18:40,060
- Oh, stop pretending I even remember.
- Stop pretending!

1065
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:47,150
Roman?

1066
01:18:57,620 --> 01:19:01,120
Roman?

1067
01:19:04,540 --> 01:19:07,840
- Any sign of her?
- No.

1068
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:10,340
This is so strange.

1069
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:12,430
It sure is.

1070
01:19:12,680 --> 01:19:14,680
Dewey, do you have caller I.D.
on your cell phone?

1071
01:19:14,930 --> 01:19:18,600
-Yeah.
-All right, use it and-and press "send."

1072
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:30,940
What the hell?

1073
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:45,000
What is this thing?

1074
01:19:45,630 --> 01:19:49,800
Is this what he--
What the hell?

1075
01:19:51,380 --> 01:19:53,670
Dewey, he's got our voices.

1076
01:19:53,930 --> 01:19:55,760
He's got Sid.

1077
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:57,850
He's got us all.

1078
01:19:58,100 --> 01:20:01,810
- Oh, my God. We gotta find her.
- Come on.

1079
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:04,440
All right, take the gun.

1080
01:20:04,690 --> 01:20:06,900
Go find Roman and Jennifer.
I'm gonna get the others.

1081
01:20:07,150 --> 01:20:10,650
- Be careful.
- You too.

1082
01:20:11,820 --> 01:20:17,570
Tyson! Angelina!
You up there?

1083
01:20:18,450 --> 01:20:21,240
- Roman!
- Tyson!

1084
01:20:21,490 --> 01:20:23,700
Angelina!

1085
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,830
Damn it!

1086
01:20:27,080 --> 01:20:29,000
Okay, come on.
We gotta get out of here.

1087
01:20:29,250 --> 01:20:31,340
- Where's Angelina?
- I don't know. She went in here.

1088
01:20:31,590 --> 01:20:33,630
- I came in after her. Now she's gone.
- Great.

1089
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:38,680
- What's wrong?
- Looks like Stab 3
is back in production.

1090
01:20:40,300 --> 01:20:43,600
Roman!

1091
01:20:43,850 --> 01:20:47,940
Jennifer!

1092
01:20:58,030 --> 01:21:02,030
Jennifer!

1093
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:08,790
Roman!

1094
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:12,550
Jennifer!

1095
01:21:19,550 --> 01:21:24,020
Roman?

1096
01:21:38,910 --> 01:21:40,740
- Is he dead?
- Yeah, very.

1097
01:21:40,990 --> 01:21:45,080
Dewey! Dewey!

1098
01:21:48,580 --> 01:21:51,460
Dewey?

1099
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:54,170
Dewey!

1100
01:21:54,420 --> 01:21:56,630
God, I'm sorry.
Jennifer, Gale, look.

1101
01:21:56,880 --> 01:21:59,340
- I found a secret passage.
- Roman's dead.

1102
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:02,050
- What?
- The killer's here.
- What?

1103
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:05,770
- Let go of me! I'm getting out of here!
- You're not safe alone!

1104
01:22:06,020 --> 01:22:07,850
Listen to me!

1105
01:22:08,100 --> 01:22:12,190
I did not fuck that pig Milton
to get a leading role...

1106
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:17,900
just to die here with second-rate
celebrities like you two!

1107
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:23,030
- Gale! I'm up here.
- Come on.

1108
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,700
- Dewey!
- You guys should get out too.

1109
01:22:26,950 --> 01:22:30,960
It's crazy to still be here.

1110
01:22:36,170 --> 01:22:40,720
- Wait!
- Come on!

1111
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:58,150
- Dewey!
- Gale, Jennifer, up here!

1112
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,110
Dewey, here.
He got Roman and Angelina too.

1113
01:23:01,360 --> 01:23:05,200
- We'll be safer if we
stick together, won't we?
- Of course. Why--

1114
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:09,120
What's goin' on?
Oh, shit!

1115
01:23:09,370 --> 01:23:12,710
- Hey!
- Dewey!

1116
01:23:12,750 --> 01:23:15,670
Dewey!

1117
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:19,340
No!

1118
01:23:28,060 --> 01:23:31,270
Help! Police!
Help! Help!

1119
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,730
Police! Help!

1120
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,910
Oh, you motherfucker!

1121
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:26,410
Damn!

1122
01:24:29,240 --> 01:24:34,120
Dewey! Dewey!

1123
01:24:36,370 --> 01:24:40,540
Behind the mirror, Dewey!

1124
01:24:41,300 --> 01:24:43,630
Gale! Get away! Dewey!

1125
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,050
- Do you hear something?
- Get away from me, you asshole.

1126
01:24:46,300 --> 01:24:50,970
- Get away from me! You don't scare me!
- Look, Gale. The mirror's moving.

1127
01:24:51,220 --> 01:24:54,560
- Gale! Gale!
- Stand back, Gale.

1128
01:24:54,810 --> 01:24:57,940
You can't kill me. I'm the killer
in Stab 3. I'm the killer!

1129
01:24:58,190 --> 01:25:02,440
Gale, cover!

1130
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:06,610
Dewey!

1131
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:18,210
- Tyson!
- Tyson!

1132
01:25:18,460 --> 01:25:20,290
I'm gonna check down here.
You call for help.

1133
01:25:20,540 --> 01:25:22,750
Okay.

1134
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:26,050
Tyson!

1135
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,800
- Tyson?
- Any sign of him?

1136
01:25:30,050 --> 01:25:33,640
- No.
- All right. I'm gonna check out front.

1137
01:25:39,350 --> 01:25:42,860
Dew--

1138
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:10,130
Gale!

1139
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:14,930
Gale!

1140
01:26:15,560 --> 01:26:17,930
Gale!

1141
01:26:18,180 --> 01:26:22,190
- Dewey?
- Gale!

1142
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:27,070
Gale!

1143
01:26:30,660 --> 01:26:33,160
- Who is this?
- Dewey, it's me.

1144
01:26:33,410 --> 01:26:36,290
Gale, where are you?

1145
01:26:36,540 --> 01:26:38,910
I'm in the basement.
I'm trapped.

1146
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:42,920
- Where?
- There's a door in the kitchen.

1147
01:26:43,960 --> 01:26:47,550
Hurry.

1148
01:26:49,670 --> 01:26:53,640
Wait. How do I know this is
you, Gale, and not the killer?

1149
01:26:53,890 --> 01:26:57,270
Dewey, open the fucking door.
It's me.

1150
01:26:57,520 --> 01:27:00,180
Well, don't you think that's
what the killer would say?

1151
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:06,860
Come on. He's out cold
at the bottom of the stairs.

1152
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:11,240
Hey!

1153
01:27:22,670 --> 01:27:26,750
Dewey. Dewey.

1154
01:27:35,890 --> 01:27:37,760
All right, all right.
It's pizza, not a party.

1155
01:27:38,010 --> 01:27:42,440
Everybody get back to work.
Anybody seen my fuckin' partner?

1156
01:27:42,690 --> 01:27:46,190
Hey, Morgan,
what did you pay?

1157
01:28:34,070 --> 01:28:37,240
- Hello?
- Hello?

1158
01:28:37,490 --> 01:28:39,910
- Who is this?
- Who is this?

1159
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:45,250
- Um, w-who's calling?
- Um, w-who's calling?

1160
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:50,750
Gale, Dewey, whoever, um, call me back.
I can only hear myself.

1161
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,550
I only hear you too, Sidney.

1162
01:28:55,720 --> 01:28:59,010
- Who is this?
- The question isn't who I am.

1163
01:28:59,260 --> 01:29:02,970
The question is:
Who's with me?

1164
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:05,060
- Sidney, stay away!
- Sidney!

1165
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:08,650
Don't do it. If you do one thing
to attract attention to yourself...

1166
01:29:08,900 --> 01:29:11,570
one thing,
I'll kill them both.

1167
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:17,280
Now, do you have somewhere
we can be alone?

1168
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:21,830
- Yes.
- Yeah. Go there.

1169
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:29,790
Oh, it's hard being friends
with you, Sidney.

1170
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:33,000
When you're friends with Sidney,
you die.

1171
01:29:33,250 --> 01:29:37,550
Well, these friends don't have to,
Sidney. It's up to you.

1172
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,720
- How do I know their voices are--
- Are real?

1173
01:29:39,970 --> 01:29:41,890
How do you know
you're not hearing things?

1174
01:29:42,140 --> 01:29:47,270
How do you know I'm not someone
in your head? Somewhere you know.

1175
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,900
- Don't come here, Sidney!
- Dewey!

1176
01:29:50,150 --> 01:29:53,230
- Or do you?
- You're dead.

1177
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,740
I don't want them.
I want you.

1178
01:29:55,990 --> 01:29:58,570
It's simple.
You show yourself, they survive.

1179
01:29:58,820 --> 01:30:01,200
- You run, they die.
- Oh, God!

1180
01:30:01,450 --> 01:30:05,330
Don't you wanna know, Sidney,
who killed her?

1181
01:30:05,580 --> 01:30:08,920
Don't you wanna know
who killed your mother?

1182
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:11,000
- Have you seen Kincaid?
- Yeah, I saw him go out.

1183
01:30:11,250 --> 01:30:12,920
- Wallace is still lookin' for him.
- Where?

1184
01:30:13,170 --> 01:30:17,130
She'd have been so happy, Sidney,
to know we'd be together.

1185
01:30:17,380 --> 01:30:22,680
- Where?
- I'll call you when you're on your way.

1186
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:29,350
Shit. Shit. Shit.

1187
01:31:36,540 --> 01:31:40,630
Holy shit.

1188
01:31:48,850 --> 01:31:51,140
- What?
- You follow directions well, Sidney.

1189
01:31:51,390 --> 01:31:53,440
Now, welcome to the final act.

1190
01:31:53,690 --> 01:31:56,270
See that metal detector?

1191
01:31:56,520 --> 01:32:00,440
Use it.

1192
01:32:03,280 --> 01:32:07,830
All over, Sidney.
Everywhere.

1193
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:16,290
Everywhere.
The other leg too.

1194
01:32:19,050 --> 01:32:22,720
Show it to me.

1195
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:30,310
Throw it in the pool.

1196
01:32:32,020 --> 01:32:33,850
Now, come inside, Sidney.

1197
01:32:34,100 --> 01:32:36,900
No fucking way. How do I know
they're not dead already?

1198
01:32:37,150 --> 01:32:40,360
They're right inside,
waiting for you.

1199
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:44,110
Look for yourself.

1200
01:32:54,210 --> 01:32:59,210
Now that we're all here,
the party can begin.

1201
01:32:59,460 --> 01:33:02,710
- Dewey.
- Sid.

1202
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,840
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

1203
01:33:06,090 --> 01:33:10,010
He's right there!

1204
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:17,230
Oh, shit.

1205
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,150
Think again.

1206
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:23,320
It's your turn to scream, asshole.

1207
01:33:25,190 --> 01:33:29,570
Yeah!

1208
01:33:32,660 --> 01:33:36,000
- It's okay.Just give me a second.
- Okay.

1209
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:41,290
- Hurry, Sid.
- Sidney? Sidney?

1210
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:46,510
Where is he?

1211
01:33:48,260 --> 01:33:51,850
Be careful!

1212
01:33:57,560 --> 01:34:00,980
I heard shots. Tyson's dead.
What's goin' on?

1213
01:34:01,230 --> 01:34:03,770
- What're you doin' here, Kincaid?
- Lookin' for you.

1214
01:34:04,030 --> 01:34:07,030
Tyson said there was a party here
tonight, and I thought, uh-oh.

1215
01:34:07,280 --> 01:34:09,200
Third act celebration.
Thought I better check it out.

1216
01:34:09,450 --> 01:34:13,370
Alone?
Where's your partner?

1217
01:34:15,750 --> 01:34:18,540
Hey, Miss Prescott.

1218
01:34:18,790 --> 01:34:23,500
I'm here to help.
Put the gun down.

1219
01:34:24,420 --> 01:34:27,840
Put the gun down.

1220
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:34,720
No!

1221
01:34:38,230 --> 01:34:42,650
Sid! Wake up, Sid!
Sid, come on!

1222
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:46,780
- Wake up!
- Sidney!

1223
01:34:47,030 --> 01:34:49,320
Sid, shoot him! Sid!

1224
01:34:49,570 --> 01:34:53,280
Shoot the fucker!

1225
01:34:53,530 --> 01:34:57,910
Shoot him!

1226
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:04,040
You want me, motherfucker?
Come and get me.

1227
01:35:04,290 --> 01:35:08,550
Run!

1228
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:58,060
Sid.

1229
01:35:58,310 --> 01:36:01,680
Sid.

1230
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:07,520
Come in here, please.

1231
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:12,360
It's just me, Sid.

1232
01:36:12,610 --> 01:36:16,320
Oh, I was so pretty.

1233
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:19,830
Everybody loved me.

1234
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:24,540
Have you missed me, Sidney?

1235
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:30,800
Would you like to hold me
one last time?

1236
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:33,880
What's the matter?
What are you staring at?

1237
01:36:34,130 --> 01:36:40,140
Don't you remember your mother?

1238
01:36:50,020 --> 01:36:52,030
You're not going anywhere, Sidney.

1239
01:36:52,280 --> 01:36:58,120
It's time you came to terms
with me and with Mother.

1240
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:01,830
Maybe you never
knew her at all, Sidney.

1241
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:07,040
Maybe you just can't get past
the surface of things.

1242
01:37:07,290 --> 01:37:10,960
- Who the hell are you?
- The other half of you.

1243
01:37:11,210 --> 01:37:15,130
I searched for a mother too,
an actress named Rina Reynolds.

1244
01:37:15,380 --> 01:37:17,260
Tried to find her my whole life.

1245
01:37:17,510 --> 01:37:20,300
And four years ago,
I actually tracked her down.

1246
01:37:20,550 --> 01:37:23,680
Knocked at her door, thinking
she'd welcome me with open arms.

1247
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:28,310
But she had a new life
and a new name: Maureen Prescott.

1248
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,440
You were the only child
she claimed, Sidney.

1249
01:37:30,690 --> 01:37:33,530
She shut me out
in the cold forever.

1250
01:37:33,780 --> 01:37:37,860
Her own son.

1251
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:47,000
Roman Bridger, director.
And brother.

1252
01:37:47,250 --> 01:37:49,790
She slammed the door in my face, Sid.
She said I was Rina's child...

1253
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:52,130
and Rina was dead.

1254
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:54,300
And it struck me.

1255
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:57,720
What a good idea!
So I watched her.

1256
01:37:57,970 --> 01:38:01,850
I made a little home movie.
A little-little family film.

1257
01:38:02,100 --> 01:38:05,020
It seems Maureen--
Mom--

1258
01:38:05,270 --> 01:38:09,230
She really got around.
I mean, Cotton was one thing.

1259
01:38:09,480 --> 01:38:11,520
Everybody knew about that.

1260
01:38:11,770 --> 01:38:16,320
But Billy's father?
That was the key.

1261
01:38:16,570 --> 01:38:18,530
Your boyfriend didn't like seeing
his daddy in my film too much.

1262
01:38:18,780 --> 01:38:20,910
He didn't like it at all.

1263
01:38:21,160 --> 01:38:25,290
But once I supplied the motivation,
all the kid needed was a few pointers.

1264
01:38:25,540 --> 01:38:28,750
Have a partner to sell out in case
you get caught, find someone to frame.

1265
01:38:29,000 --> 01:38:31,290
It was like
he was making a movie.

1266
01:38:31,540 --> 01:38:36,050
You. This is all because ofyou.

1267
01:38:36,300 --> 01:38:39,720
I'm a director, Sid.

1268
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:42,220
- I direct.
- Oh.

1269
01:38:42,470 --> 01:38:47,350
I had no idea that they were
gonna make a film of their own.

1270
01:38:48,230 --> 01:38:51,900
- Oh, shit.
- What a film it turned out to be, huh?

1271
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:54,940
I mean, introducing Sidney,
the victim.

1272
01:38:55,190 --> 01:39:00,150
Sidney, the survivor.
Sidney, the star!

1273
01:39:14,460 --> 01:39:16,550
All right. You're gonna be all right.
Just apply pressure.

1274
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:19,050
Here, take this.
Get the son ofa bitch.

1275
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:20,800
Let's go.

1276
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:23,890
Fine, you got what you wanted,
hero and villain face-to-face.

1277
01:39:24,140 --> 01:39:26,810
- Well, you know what happens now?
The villain dies!
- Exactly!

1278
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:31,310
But I'm not the villain, Sid.
You are.

1279
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:35,980
Here he is, the man who gave away
your mother's innocence.

1280
01:39:36,230 --> 01:39:38,570
Huh? What he did
to her made her a slut.

1281
01:39:38,820 --> 01:39:43,030
Didn't it? Huh? She never recovered from
that night, right here in this room.

1282
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:46,740
They fucked her three ways from Sunday.
Ruined her life.

1283
01:39:46,990 --> 01:39:48,660
Ruined yours too,
didn't it, Sid?

1284
01:39:48,910 --> 01:39:51,290
You hate him, Sid?

1285
01:39:51,540 --> 01:39:57,130
Come on, I know you do.
I'm sure you do.

1286
01:39:57,340 --> 01:39:59,670
I know who you are.
I know what happened to my mother.

1287
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,720
And I want you to understand,
I'm gonna make you pay!

1288
01:40:02,970 --> 01:40:04,800
That's what the police are gonna
find on Milton's answering machine...

1289
01:40:05,050 --> 01:40:08,600
right next to his lifeless,
mutilated corpse.

1290
01:40:08,850 --> 01:40:10,980
- What? Can't hear ya.
- You don't have to do this, Roman.

1291
01:40:11,230 --> 01:40:13,100
Just tell me what you want.
I can make it happen.

1292
01:40:13,350 --> 01:40:15,270
Any picture.
Name your budget. Script approval.

1293
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:17,610
- Final cut!
- I already have it.

1294
01:40:17,860 --> 01:40:21,190
No!

1295
01:40:21,900 --> 01:40:23,740
God! You spineless bastard!

1296
01:40:23,990 --> 01:40:26,820
No, Sid, that would be you.
You did it all.

1297
01:40:27,070 --> 01:40:31,000
You did it, you called them all.
Even your closest friends.

1298
01:40:31,250 --> 01:40:33,620
Living in total isolation, the pressure
ofanother movie about you...

1299
01:40:33,870 --> 01:40:36,880
the discovery that Milton
destroyed Mommy dearest...

1300
01:40:37,130 --> 01:40:40,210
you finally just snapped!

1301
01:40:40,460 --> 01:40:44,840
One, two, three!

1302
01:40:45,890 --> 01:40:49,560
And who's our hero, huh?
The sole survivor. Who's the one...

1303
01:40:49,810 --> 01:40:53,600
who bravely faced down the psychopath
and killed her with her own knife?

1304
01:40:53,850 --> 01:40:56,060
You're gonna pay for the life
you stole from me, Sid.

1305
01:40:56,310 --> 01:41:00,020
For the mother, and for the family,
and for the stardom and--

1306
01:41:00,270 --> 01:41:02,400
Goddam it! Everything you have
that should've been mine!

1307
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:05,660
God! Why don't you stop your whining
and get on with it?
I've heard this shit before!

1308
01:41:05,910 --> 01:41:08,120
- Stop!
- You know why you kill people,
Roman? Do you?

1309
01:41:08,370 --> 01:41:11,330
- I don't wanna hear it!
- Because you choose to!
There is no one else to blame!

1310
01:41:11,580 --> 01:41:14,790
- Stop it! Fucking damn it!
- Why don't you take
some fucking responsibility?

1311
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:18,880
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1312
01:41:30,600 --> 01:41:34,100
Sid? Sidney?

1313
01:41:41,610 --> 01:41:45,110
Sidney?

1314
01:41:52,160 --> 01:41:55,250
Sidney!

1315
01:42:07,930 --> 01:42:10,850
Sidney!

1316
01:42:13,010 --> 01:42:16,100
Leave her alone!

1317
01:42:25,940 --> 01:42:29,110
Dewey, do something!

1318
01:42:32,120 --> 01:42:36,660
- Stand back!
- Dewey!

1319
01:42:39,830 --> 01:42:43,670
Sid! Sid.

1320
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:10,910
Sid?

1321
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:17,040
Where is he?

1322
01:43:29,800 --> 01:43:33,050
Hey. Lose something?

1323
01:43:33,300 --> 01:43:36,640
Found something.

1324
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:02,710
There's gotta be another way in there!
Come on!

1325
01:44:07,550 --> 01:44:12,260
You hurt her,
I swear I'll kill you!

1326
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:29,110
-Dewey!
-Down this way. There's another hallway.

1327
01:44:39,870 --> 01:44:43,370
There's another door down here.

1328
01:44:49,170 --> 01:44:51,420
- This thing's not budging.
- Look around for something heavy.

1329
01:44:51,670 --> 01:44:55,840
- Go that way.
- Okay!

1330
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:24,080
I shot you.

1331
01:45:27,790 --> 01:45:32,420
I guess we think alike.

1332
01:45:32,420 --> 01:45:35,170
Mother's dead.

1333
01:45:35,420 --> 01:45:38,930
And there is nothing
you can do about that.

1334
01:45:39,100 --> 01:45:42,310
I still got
to make my movie.

1335
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,560
Stab 3, right?

1336
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:06,660
Kincaid, hang in there.

1337
01:46:06,830 --> 01:46:11,960
Roman? It was Roman?

1338
01:46:35,320 --> 01:46:40,620
Be careful, Sid. Randy said
the killer's always superhuman.

1339
01:46:41,950 --> 01:46:45,750
Yeah, well,
he wasn't superhuman, Dewey.

1340
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:49,750
He wasn't superhuman at all.

1341
01:46:53,840 --> 01:46:55,880
- You can't fuckin' kill me!
- Head!

1342
01:46:56,130 --> 01:46:58,380
- Head! Head, Dewey!
- What?

1343
01:46:58,630 --> 01:47:02,300
Head!
Shoot him in the head.

1344
01:47:13,770 --> 01:47:15,820
Thanks.

1345
01:47:16,070 --> 01:47:19,570
No problem.

1346
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:47,010
Look.

1347
01:47:47,270 --> 01:47:49,390
Come on, Cherokee.
Come on.

1348
01:47:49,640 --> 01:47:54,360
- Yeah, she's doin' great.
- Yeah.

1349
01:47:58,030 --> 01:48:01,530
Look.

1350
01:48:01,820 --> 01:48:03,780
What are you doing with that?

1351
01:48:04,030 --> 01:48:07,740
Um, will you sign it
for me, Gale?

1352
01:48:07,990 --> 01:48:10,250
You hate that book.

1353
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:13,620
Besides, I'm-l'm done
with that kind of reporting.

1354
01:48:13,870 --> 01:48:19,260
For me.
Will you sign it for me?

1355
01:48:20,460 --> 01:48:23,340
You're a nut.

1356
01:48:23,590 --> 01:48:26,680
Okay.

1357
01:48:35,400 --> 01:48:39,690
- Will you?
- Dewey.

1358
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:43,450
I know it'll never work,
and you know it'll never work.

1359
01:48:43,700 --> 01:48:51,000
But what I'm asking is
just to see ifwe're wrong.

1360
01:48:51,330 --> 01:48:55,250
We don't know everything, Gale.

1361
01:48:56,130 --> 01:49:01,010
I mean, you thinkyou do, but--

1362
01:49:06,890 --> 01:49:10,470
You're a brave man,
Dewey Riley.

1363
01:49:10,890 --> 01:49:15,060
I'm really scared right now.

1364
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:01,480
Inside.

1365
01:50:05,900 --> 01:50:09,070
Sid, we've been waiting for you.
We're gonna start a movie.

1366
01:50:09,320 --> 01:50:15,660
- What kind of movie?
- You have to come and see.

1367
01:50:43,900 --> 01:50:47,610
Take a little walk
to the edge of town

1368
01:50:47,860 --> 01:50:51,620
Now, spread your wings and fly

1369
01:50:51,870 --> 01:50:55,830
Don't the lights of the city
look so damn pretty

1370
01:50:56,080 --> 01:51:00,290
When you're flyin' so high

1371
01:51:00,540 --> 01:51:04,050
It's hard to know
about there down below

1372
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:09,220
The streets fade
They're swimmin'deep in blood

1373
01:51:09,470 --> 01:51:16,350
It seems to make me
groan and cry

1374
01:51:16,970 --> 01:51:20,310
You really wanna know
what's wrong with this land

1375
01:51:20,560 --> 01:51:26,230
Just scratch your head
with your red right hand

1376
01:51:27,780 --> 01:51:32,280
I'm talkin'about blood, babe

1377
01:51:32,530 --> 01:51:36,490
It's in your veins

1378
01:51:36,740 --> 01:51:40,330
Your mommy and daddy

1379
01:51:40,580 --> 01:51:44,250
They've got the same

1380
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:50,680
You're under the mirror
day after day

1381
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:54,640
You see a pretty face
crumblin' away

1382
01:51:54,890 --> 01:52:01,940
As you become
your mom and daddy

1383
01:52:02,060 --> 01:52:06,570
Scream once, scream twice
Now scream again

1384
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:12,820
Cover that face
with your red right hand

1385
01:52:24,790 --> 01:52:29,340
So, is this the end

1386
01:52:29,590 --> 01:52:34,390
Forus, my friend

1387
01:52:37,810 --> 01:52:42,100
So, is this the end

1388
01:52:42,350 --> 01:52:47,820
Forus, my friend

1389
01:52:50,480 --> 01:52:54,910
So, is this the end

1390
01:52:55,160 --> 01:53:00,620
Forus, my friend

1391
01:53:17,470 --> 01:53:24,270
Well as though we rise

1392
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:30,070
As the day breaks the dawn

1393
01:53:30,320 --> 01:53:37,110
And as the moon hides the sun

1394
01:53:37,370 --> 01:53:41,290
Oh, the sun

1395
01:53:43,000 --> 01:53:49,170
No more sorrow

1396
01:53:50,090 --> 01:53:55,800
All those crying days are gone

1397
01:53:56,050 --> 01:53:59,430
No more sorrow

1398
01:53:59,680 --> 01:54:02,470
Now it'sgone

1399
01:54:02,720 --> 01:54:05,730
Now it'sgone

1400
01:54:05,980 --> 01:54:10,150
Now it'sgone

1401
01:54:13,650 --> 01:54:18,320
So, is this the end

1402
01:54:18,570 --> 01:54:25,160
Forus, my friend

1403
01:54:28,250 --> 01:54:32,500
Spoke to my god today
Asked him why he'd gone away

1404
01:54:32,750 --> 01:54:36,800
Hitched on a rocket ride
into the sun

1405
01:54:37,050 --> 01:54:41,300
Said, son I got one for ya
Down there in California

1406
01:54:41,550 --> 01:54:45,680
Just take a look around
at all you've done

1407
01:54:45,930 --> 01:54:49,060
You're automatic
like a burnin' gun

1408
01:54:49,310 --> 01:54:54,440
You're a star like everyone

1409
01:54:54,780 --> 01:54:58,860
Talked to my soul today
Couldn't keep my brain away

1410
01:54:59,110 --> 01:55:03,200
So I found a holiday
behind the sun

1411
01:55:03,450 --> 01:55:07,660
Took all the friends I could
Spun out in Hollywood

1412
01:55:07,910 --> 01:55:12,080
Hit up on a climate everyone

1413
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:15,460
You're automatic
like a burnin' gun

1414
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:21,090
You're a star like everyone

1415
01:55:21,800 --> 01:55:25,890
You could save the world

1416
01:55:26,140 --> 01:55:30,560
Could be shining on my pearl

1417
01:55:30,810 --> 01:55:34,860
You could save the world

1418
01:55:35,110 --> 01:55:40,400
Just might find your way
mypearl

1419
01:55:40,660 --> 01:55:44,080
Shine

1420
01:55:46,540 --> 01:55:50,290
Shine

1421
01:55:56,340 --> 01:55:59,420
You're automatic
like a burnin' gun

1422
01:55:59,670 --> 01:56:05,510
You're a star like everyone

1423
01:56:05,810 --> 01:56:09,890

01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:18,780
You could save the world

1426
01:56:19,030 --> 01:56:23,240
Could be shinin' on my pearl

1427
01:56:23,490 --> 01:56:27,620

Just might find your way
