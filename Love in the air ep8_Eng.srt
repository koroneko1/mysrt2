1
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,080
Welcome to Street Racing Circuit.
Please state your name.

2
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,039
Are you sure this is the place?

3
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,479
That’s what I’ve gathered from the source.

4
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
What source?

5
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:41,800
You don’t need to know.

6
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,320
Sky.

7
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,960
My ex.

8
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,680
But now that you’ve
seen it, let’s go home.

9
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,880
No.

10
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:55,680
Wait here.
I don’t wanna cause you problem.

11
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,520
I’ll be gone for a sec.

12
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,640
Rain! Rain!

13
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,720
Rain! Rain!

14
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,240
What a troublemaker.

15
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,720
These people aren’t assholes like my ex.

16
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,160
Right?

17
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,240
- Ready?
- We’re all set, Mr. Payu.

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,600
Hey. It’s rare to see you go all out today.

19
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,560
Higher-up’s order.
But you like it too, right?

20
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,520
Your babies are such beauties.
Of course, I like them.

21
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,640
They’re P’ Pakin’s babies.

22
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,960
I don’t dare to mess with that guy.

23
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,040
Nice bike, by the way.

24
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,400
Catch that man!

25
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,000
Which daredevil’s causing a ruckus?

26
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,600
But the real devil’s right here.

27
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,800
Hey! Stop!

28
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,400
Stop!

29
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,520
I’m leaving early today.

30
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,680
You can punish me
later if you’re unhappy.

31
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,680
- I’ll have Saifha replace me.
- Hey!

32
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,680
You’re disobeying P’ Pakin?
This is an important event.

33
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,360
But there's something more important.

34
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,600
Let go of me! Let go!

35
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,520
He’s my boy.

36
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,600
Let’s talk, shall we?

37
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,240
Don’t you know it’s bad to sneak in?

38
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,520
Are you a friend of that boy?

39
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,040
How stubborn.

40
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,080
It’s fine if you don’t wanna answer.

41
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,560
But do you know outsiders
aren’t allowed to enter the venue?

42
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,680
Which means an intruder
like you isn’t allowed to leave.

43
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,480
What do you want?

44
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,320
It depends on what you can offer me.

45
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,200
But if I can choose…

46
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,960
So do you know now what you
need to give to get out of here?

47
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,800
You’d better hurry up.
Looks like the next race’s about to start.

48
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,320
Tick tock.

49
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,520
Just take what you want.

50
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,440
Not Just Wind, but a Typhoon

51
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,680
Where’s a condom?

52
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Under the pillow.

53
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,720
Say something.

54
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,640
Do you realize what you did?

55
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,840
I…

56
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,320
Do you know what would
happen if I wasn’t there?

57
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
I’m sorry.

58
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,360
I’m asking if you know.
I don’t want your apology.

59
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,600
Wanna throw your future down the drain?

60
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:27,400
No matter how stupid you are,
if only you used your brain…

61
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:34,800
Then you would’ve realized how powerful
illegal street racing’s organizers are.

62
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,480
Making a stupid brat disappear
is a piece of cake for them.

63
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,640
I…

64
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,360
I thought you were mature.

65
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,800
Don’t think that crying out for your
parents’ help can solve everything.

66
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,040
Some matters...

67
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,960
Can’t be solved with just apologies.

68
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,400
Grow up.

69
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,040
Don’t be a crybaby.

70
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,520
I didn’t mean to get anyone in trouble.

71
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,520
I just wanted to get back at you.

72
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,640
That’s all.

73
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,960
Stupid.

74
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,440
Go home.

75
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,600
Stupid. Stupid. Stupid.
That’s all you’ve been saying.

76
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,440
You keep calling me stupid!

77
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:43,200
Fine, I’m stupid for being reckless.

78
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,480
I’m brainless just like you said.

79
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,040
Just you wait.

80
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,680
I’ll make you so head over heels with me
that you won’t call me stupid ever again.

81
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,440
Then I’ll be waiting.

82
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,760
You’d better keep your word.

83
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,480
What the hell have I done?

84
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,920
Wanna make me fall for you?

85
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,680
I wasn’t gonna show you my bad side.

86
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,800
You wanna make me love you.

87
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,400
But do you know what kind of a man I am?

88
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,800
The night has just begun.

89
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,640
Bring it on.

90
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,880
They’re all assholes.

91
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,600
You’re also an asshole.

92
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,600
You’re leaving?

93
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,560
I don’t have to stay.

94
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,720
So cold.

95
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,360
You were so cute earlier.

96
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
At least leave me your number.

97
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,280
At least tell me your name.

98
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,520
What a cold boy.

99
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,920
Have you gone crazy
from being pent up, P’ Pai?

100
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,480
Your big brother? Pent up?
Don’t take your frustration out on me.

101
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,280
Aren’t there any good men left around here?

102
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,680
He’s right here.

103
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,840
Rich and handsome.
A total package.

104
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,880
I want someone wild, not rich.

105
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,240
How do you know I’m not wild?

106
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,040
Please stop, it’s cringey.

107
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:11,240
Let’s go, we’re gonna
be late for family dinner.

108
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,640
I don’t wanna go.

109
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,480
Mom’s gonna preach
at me for sleeping around.

110
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,480
She won’t stop until
the three of us settle down.

111
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,079
Not gonna happen.

112
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:26,119
Single life’s the best.
I can sleep with whoever I want.

113
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,800
You’re right.

114
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,320
Freedom is the best.

115
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,880
Let’s go.

116
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,120
Shitty things always happen to me.

117
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,160
Now’s the part you’ve been
waiting for, ‘Chitchat of the Day.’

118
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,560
Today’s topic is...

119
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,000
‘How to forget the one you want to forget.’

120
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,320
Let’s hear some answers from our listeners.

121
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,840
Khun Focus says, ‘Try to live well
every day and we’ll soon forget them.’

122
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:53,920
I guess Khun Focus is focused
on living her life to the fullest.

123
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,280
Continue.

124
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,240
Let’s check out Khun Pompam’s advice.

125
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,480
She says, ‘Working is the way to forget.’

126
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,560
‘Work to forget. Work to death.
Soon you’ll get over a heartbreak.’

127
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,640
Oops, this method’s a bit
too hard on your body.

128
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:15,960
This one’s interesting.
Khun Oum says, ‘Why must we forget?’

129
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,360
‘The more you want to forget,
the more you remember.’

130
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:23,800
‘Let them occupy your thoughts
until they leave on their own.’

131
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:28,440
What about you? How do you
forget the one you want to forget?

132
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,240
Share your tips with us.

133
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,880
Three Months Later

134
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:54,080
I’d like to ask about class shirts.

135
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:58,240
Oh right, we’ve agreed to
use this design for the shirts.

136
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,960
I came up with it.
I think it’s the best one.

137
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,920
Hold on, P’ Som.

138
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:08,400
What’s this old-fashioned design?
Who uses red and black nowadays?

139
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,760
- It’s so cheesy.
- What’s bad about it?

140
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,200
I’ll show you.

141
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,320
This abstract design strongly
represents architecture.

142
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,640
- It’s got three-dimensional structure.
- It looks confusing.

143
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,720
Do you know how to make your design better?

144
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:22,480
- I'll show you how to make it better.
- Sig!

145
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,200
- Just turn it upside down!
- Give it back!

146
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,040
- See? It looks so much better now.
- Sig, give it back.

147
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,720
- Or better yet, flip it like this.
- I thought the design out.

148
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,800
I think we should stop for today.

149
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,120
Why?

150
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,200
I’ve got something to figure out.

151
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,880
Sorry.

152
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,000
I’ll make it up to you next time.

153
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,520
And when is that?

154
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,840
I’ll call you when I’m free.

155
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,360
But today I want you to go home.

156
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,760
Please understand me.

157
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,240
It must be changed.
The design you came up with totally sucks.

158
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,440
But we’ve decided on…

159
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,720
Change it.

160
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,720
That’s enough, guys.
Please stop.

161
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,280
Why are you arguing?

162
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,160
Sig, you should accept
the seniors' decision.

163
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,840
- Stop arguing with him.
- I can’t, I’m the sophomore rep.

164
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,560
And I’m just voicing my opinion.
What’s wrong with that?

165
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,840
Just voicing your opinion?

166
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,240
We’ve reached the decision
on the freshmen orientation.

167
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,440
You can’t just ask us to change our plan.

168
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,000
Have some respect to your seniors!

169
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,880
You always bring up seniority
when you can’t argue back.

170
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,440
Cool down.

171
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,240
I’m the coolest I’ve ever been.

172
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,760
If I get any cooler,
I’ll become an ice cube.

173
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,200
Give me some time.

174
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
Calm down.

175
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,040
I’m sorry, Sky.
P’ Som’s been moody lately.

176
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,880
He’s been in charge of
orientation activities from the start.

177
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,480
He won’t hand it over even
though he’s in the 5th year.

178
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,200
It’s okay, I understand.

179
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,360
So how have you been lately?
Let me know if you need any help.

180
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,000
I know you’re very busy
with the student club’s works.

181
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,040
It’s a piece of cake.
I can handle them.

182
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,480
And I’m especially free
during the summer break.

183
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,480
But I prefer to do only paperwork.
'Cause I can't lead orientation activities.

184
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,200
You’re so capable.

185
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,080
You’re good at studying
and student club’s works.

186
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,880
‘Cause I’ve volunteered to help.

187
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,480
Unlike Rain, that annoying guy.

188
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,400
He said he’d help but
I haven’t seen him at all.

189
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,520
I’d better go find P’ Som.
Don’t know if he’s calmed down yet.

190
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,560
Just let me know if you need any help.

191
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,480
Better do my work to occupy my thoughts.

192
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,080
Are you okay?

193
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,000
Do you need a hand?

194
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,240
- Sig, deliver these documents for me.

195
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,240
Okay.

196
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,000
Good grief.

197
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,480
- What’s your time?
- Don’t know. Wasn’t paying attention.

198
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,680
As far as I know, your
attention is usually on bikes or…

199
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:41,120
What does it mean when you
can’t get something out of your head?

200
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,600
It’s either you love it very much
or hate it very much.

201
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,200
Or interested in it very much.

202
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,160
Who is it?

203
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:57,760
Nice weather today.

204
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,440
Nice my ass.
It’s fucking hot as hell.

205
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,960
What does it have to do with the weather?

206
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:11,040
Beautiful sky and nice weather
are perfect for making a decision.

207
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,760
And I’ve made up my mind.

208
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,560
About what?

209
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,600
Since he won’t get out of my head...

210
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,320
I won’t let him go.

211
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,720
Wish me luck.

212
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,000
I really feel sorry for his prey.

213
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,960
Has sky watching become
popular among people around me?

214
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,520
Tanjiro’s super cool.

215
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:03,840
Huh?

216
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,480
I finished it.

217
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,440
Next volume.

218
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,560
Nine. Six.

219
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,600
Huh?

220
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,200
Where’s the next volume?

221
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,160
I remember I bought the complete set.

222
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,240
11 o’ clock.

223
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,120
I stayed up all night again.

224
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,840
So hungry.

225
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,560
And sleepy too.

226
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:52,280
Wash up, eat, sleep.
I’ll decide what to do after waking up.

227
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,040
He fought with his boyfriend
and wants to complain again.

228
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:03,920
Hmm?

229
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,560
Sawasdee krub.

230
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,120
Hello?

231
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,920
Sawasdee krub.

232
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,680
How come I spoke the lines from this novel?

233
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,160
This is weird.

234
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,120
Hello.

235
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,920
Hello, can you hear me?

236
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:32,000
Loud and clear.

237
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,400
Who’s calling, please?

238
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,320
And who’s asking?

239
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,600
I don’t know who you are.

240
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,600
But if you’re trying to
annoy me, I’m hanging up.

241
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,800
Hot-headed, aren’t you?

242
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:56,320
I wonder if you’re hot and bothered too.

243
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,640
Do you want me to help cool you down?

244
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,000
In case you didn’t know,
humans are warm blooded.

245
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,160
And I’m a human.
It’s normal for my body to be hot.

246
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:18,400
You don’t have to help me.

247
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,680
‘Cause I don’t associate
with cold-blooded animals.

248
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
Farewell.

249
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Asshole.

250
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,040
If you’ve got a lot of time to
spare, I suggest seeing a shrink.

251
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,000
No need for that.
I know the nature of my illness.

252
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,440
And it must be treated from the cause.

253
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,320
Prepare yourself, I’m gonna pursue you.

254
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,600
Who are you?

255
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,160
A hot wind god.

256
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:04,040
Brace yourself, ‘cause I’m serious.

257
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,680
Hey! Wait!
Don’t hang up!

258
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,840
What the hell?

259
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,240
Wind?

260
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,280
Nah.

261
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,440
Impossible.

262
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,280
Someone like him won’t be attracted to me.

263
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,280
What now?

264
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:39,040
I just wanna tell you that it doesn’t
hurt when you call me an asshole.

265
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,400
I’m used to it.

266
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,400
What now!

267
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,000
Are you angry with me?

268
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,520
No, I’m about to eat.

269
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,320
Then I won’t bother you.
Enjoy your lunch.

270
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:29,080
I’ve lost my appetite!

271
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,080
I’ve never met anyone
who’s so cute at being rude.

272
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,760
Be careful or this asshole
will be your boyfriend.

273
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:31,400
Weather forecast for this
morning until tomorrow morning.

274
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,160
Blustery with a chance of typhoon.

275
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,240
Sky!

276
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:54,480
- Yes, P’ Joy?
- Are you going to class?

277
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,480
Yes.

278
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,200
First day of semester.
Do your best!

279
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,440
Yes, thank you.

280
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,440
Right, have you heard
about the tenant in room 204?

281
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,840
No.

282
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,440
She broke up with her boyfriend.

283
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:09,200
The whole floor heard
them fighting last night.

284
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,360
I heard it loud and clear.
Looks like the guy was two-timing.

285
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
Have you heard?

286
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,840
- Do you know anything about it?
- Not at all.

287
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,040
Then I’ll continue.
The girl was all screaming and shouting.

288
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
And…

289
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,720
- P’ Joy.
- Yes?

290
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,000
I need to hurry or I’ll be late.

291
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,680
- Please excuse me.
- Sorry, I got carried away. Run along.

292
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,240
- Yes.
- Okay.

293
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,240
- Do your best!
- Yes.

294
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,040
Bye bye. Do your best!

295
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,800
Alright, today we’ll be
talking about formal structure…

296
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,679
See you later.

297
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,320
Chicken white butt.
Chicken white butt.

298
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,199
It will be grilled.
It will be grilled.

299
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,679
Grilled to the left.
Grilled to the…

300
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,719
Okay.

301
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,520
Everyone now knows the song.

302
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,400
Now, try dancing while
you’re sitting. Okay?

303
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,960
Do you know the dance moves?
Can you dance like a grilled chicken?

304
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,280
Grilled to the left.
Grilled to the right.

305
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,280
Dance while you’re sitting.

306
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:52,280
Remember, the best dancers
won’t have to sleep in the tent.

307
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,199
Ready? Drums. Go!

308
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:59,200
Chicken white butt.
Chicken white butt.

309
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,160
It will be grilled.
It will be grilled.

310
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,000
Grilled to the left.
Grilled to the right.

311
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,680
Very hot. Very hot. Very hot.

312
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,080
Stop.

313
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,440
We’ve found a pheasant.

314
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,960
- What’s your name?
- Ray.

315
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,720
Come up here, Ray.

316
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:23,760
P’ Som.

317
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,200
You’re already a 5th year.
Can you dance as good as her?

318
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,640
How can a senior lose to a freshman?

319
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,840
Please dance as energetically like her.

320
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,760
Okay, ready, go!

321
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,600
Chicken white butt.
Chicken white butt.

322
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,200
It will be grilled.
It will be grilled.

323
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,160
Grilled to the left.
Grilled to the right.

324
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,720
- Very hot. Very hot. Very hot.
- One more time!

325
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,440
Good night, good night, good night.

326
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,800
Get home safe, everyone.
Good night, good night.

327
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:02,080
Good night. Bye bye.
Get home safe.

328
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,680
Shit, how did he get here?

329
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,280
Oh! P’ Pai, Sawasdee krub.
Was it hard to get here?

330
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Nope.

331
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:33,400
Hey, hold on!
Come here, come here, come here.

332
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,640
You’ve met P’ Pai, right?

333
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,400
He said he got you out of the racing venue.

334
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,640
It’s okay, I’ll introduce you again.

335
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:50,000
This is P’ Prapai, P’ Payu’s
best friend from the race.

336
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,080
- Oh, and this is my friend…
- Sky.

337
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,440
You already told me.

338
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,480
Wind.

339
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,080
Prapai.

340
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,360
Well?

341
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,200
Am I as hot as I promoted myself?

342
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,840
Umm…

343
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,520
P’ Pai, you’ve got
something for P’ Payu, right?

344
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:25,680
Where is it?

345
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
Oh.

346
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,200
Just a sec.

347
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
Here.

348
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,440
It’s very important.
Don’t let anyone but Payu see it.

349
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,280
- Got it?
- Got it.

350
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,880
- I’m leaving now.
- Wait, I’ll give you a ride.

351
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,920
It’s okay, you’ve got a date with P’ Payu.
I can go back on my own.

352
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,040
Hey, that's a lot of stuff.
How will you go back?

353
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,360
Surely not by a bike taxi.
I’ll give you a ride.

354
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,160
I can give you a ride.

355
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,680
Rain doesn’t know about us, right?

356
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,800
I’ll go back with P’ Pai.

357
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
Are you sure?

358
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,920
Yeah.

359
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:35,080
Okay, then I’ll be going first.

360
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:38,040
- Yeah.
- Bye bye. See you.

361
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
Bye bye.

362
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:41,800
Safe travels, P’ Pai.
See you later.

363
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,440
Bye, Sky.

364
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:46,480
Let’s go.

365
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
This way, please.

366
00:38:57,720 --> 00:38:58,760
Thank you.

367
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,400
You should find someone else to play with.

368
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,640
I wouldn’t have been here
if I wanted someone else.

369
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,960
Look, I don’t wanna play with you.

370
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,160
If you never try, you’ll never know.

371
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:45,200
It’s because I already
tried that I don’t want to.

372
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,640
Come on, I couldn’t get you hooked at all?

373
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,080
- No.
- Not even a bit?

374
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,040
- No.
- Just feel it a bit.

375
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,800
Look, no matter how hard you try
to persuade me, the answer’s still no.

376
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:03,520
This is so unfair.

377
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,360
Am I the only one who
can’t get enough of you?

378
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:10,040
How is it unfair?
I didn’t ask for it.

379
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,560
Okay, I give up on this matter.

380
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,680
Good, now move.

381
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,760
That was then, this is now.

382
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,000
Let’s start over.

383
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:29,560
My name is Prapai.
See? I told you I’m the hot wind god.

384
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:33,200
A wind god?
I thought you were a Cyclops.

385
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,960
I admit I'm a giant with a
huge, dark one-eyed monster.

386
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:45,520
Pai Jr., someone says
you’re as huge as a giant.

387
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,040
- Are you done?
- No.

388
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:55,880
You haven’t told me your full
name, birthday, blood type...

389
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,160
Your favorite food.
Favorite movies.

390
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,520
Most importantly...

391
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,720
Do you have a boyfriend?

392
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,880
You wanna know?

393
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,480
I'll tell you in your next life.

394
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,680
Are you clear, P' Black Giant?

395
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:32,320
And are you clear, Nong Sky?

396
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,560
That I’m determined to pursue you.

397
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:11,080
Can’t believe how shameless that guy is!

398
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,080
Pursue me my ass!
No way. Never.

399
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:25,800
Rain, you’ll be dead meat tomorrow.

400
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,160
A guy like him only wants sex.
Get it together, Sky.

401
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,040
Why would I want you to be my boyfriend?

402
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,160
What an adorable boy.

403
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,480
What’s up, dude?

404
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,120
You went to my boyfriend’s
university just to give a coffee receipt?

405
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:30,680
It’s important though.

406
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,600
Yeah right, asshole.

407
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,680
Now I consider being called
an asshole a compliment.

408
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,560
Believe me when I say that
the receipt’s very important.

409
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,680
If there’s nothing else, I’m hanging up.

410
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:57,360
If I hadn’t had an excuse, I wouldn’t
have met the steeled-heart boy.

411
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,960
I’ll give in to you this time.

412
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,400
I’m sorry.

413
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,560
You know why I’m angry?

414
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:27,280
Well…

415
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:32,120
I gave P’ Pai your phone number.

416
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,840
Yeah.

417
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,920
Next time, tell me before
you give anyone my number.

418
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,920
But he said he knows you.

419
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,280
Forgive me, I really regret it.

420
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,440
Sure, I forgive you.

421
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,400
- But you must take these.
- What are they?

422
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,880
Student club’s papers.

423
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:09,800
You must fill out these documents,
ask the seniors to check them.

424
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:14,120
Then ask the teachers to sign them
and deliver them to the student council.

425
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,760
Got it?

426
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,280
But I haven’t finished a single homework.

427
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,680
And do you think I finished them?

428
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,040
Sky.

429
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:36,640
Yeah?

430
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,160
I’m sorry.

431
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,520
Can...

432
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:45,680
Can I get up now?

433
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:49,280
No, stay like that until you repent.

434
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,560
But I am repenting.

435
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,160
From now on, I’ll guard
your number with my life.

436
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:58,240
I’ll never give it to anyone again.

437
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:00,720
Please allow me to get up.
My knee hurts.

438
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,200
Good to hear, but no.

439
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,720
Let me get up.
Can I get up now?

440
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:07,720
No.

441
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:10,560
Please.

442
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:12,320
Can’t you just kneel?

443
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,360
- For how long?
- 30 minutes.

444
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,440
- 30 minutes?
- Your hands too.

445
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,480
- Sky.
- Hmm?

446
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,360
- Please let me get up.
- No.

447
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,560
Don’t you pity your friend?

448
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:26,960
No.

449
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,920
Scandals happen at my dorm every day.
Which one do you wanna hear?

450
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,400
That’s right.
Hey, I’ll call you back.

451
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,520
Sky, darling. Sky.

452
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,720
Yes?

453
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,800
- You finished your class?
- Yes.

454
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,400
Right, someone asked me to give you this.

455
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,480
What is it?

456
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,360
Here you are.
Take it.

457
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,080
A hot guy driving a luxury car asked
me to give you this sunflower bouquet.

458
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:55,880
He’s tall and dark.

459
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:59,320
I wanted to ask his name
but he left in a hurry.

460
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:01,200
Do you know who he is?

461
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:04,000
Umm, I think you’ve got the wrong person.

462
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,040
No way, I’ve absolutely
got the right person.

463
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,080
‘Cause you’re the only Sky in my dorm.

464
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,400
So who is he?

465
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,600
Beautiful flowers.

466
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,520
Meanie, why can’t I get you out of my head?

467
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,240
Psycho

468
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,080
Do you like the flowers?

469
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,520
Can you take them back?

470
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:08,080
No, I don’t have time.
I’ve been very busy these days.

471
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,720
I worked my butt off just to
find time to deliver the flowers.

472
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,040
But I don’t want them.

473
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,120
Do you know why I gave you sunflowers?

474
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,760
- I don’t care…
- ‘Cause sunflowers face the sky.

475
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,720
I can’t be the sun for you.

476
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:26,600
But whenever you see sunflowers...

477
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,280
Remember that this wind’s
watching over the sky.

478
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:37,840
Oh, I have a meeting.
Gotta go. Bye bye.

479
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,040
How did he come up with that?

480
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,120
So cheesy.

481
00:48:55,720 --> 00:48:56,800
He's cheesy.

482
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,040
And utterly shameless.

483
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,640
I’m sorry, because of your owner...

484
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:17,000
You’ve got to end up in the trashcan.

485
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,240
What flowers do teenagers like these days?

486
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,280
Where do you want them delivered?

487
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:58,240
If the flowers are in stock, the recipient
will get them in two hours at the earliest.

488
00:49:58,560 --> 00:49:59,960
I’m just asking for your opinion.

489
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:05,320
You usually order roses.

490
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:10,920
That’s out of courtesy,
but this is different.

491
00:50:12,760 --> 00:50:16,920
Why don't you choose from
the recipient’s personality?

492
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,480
Sometimes sexy.

493
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,480
Occasionally sad.

494
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,400
Mysterious at times.

495
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:31,120
But I want flowers
that give off lively vibes.

496
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:33,040
So that he’ll give me a bright smile.

497
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,920
Sunflowers.

498
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:41,520
Okay, and the delivery address?

499
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,000
No need.

500
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,760
I’ll choose them myself.

501
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,240
I wanna deliver them
to the recipient's hands.

502
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,480
Help me clear my schedule for two hours.

503
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,680
He’ll deliver them himself?

504
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:07,280
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

505
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,600
I did a bachelor's and master's degrees in the UK.

506
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:11,480
-I don't wanna know.
-But I wanna tell you.

507
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,840
Don't you like Prapai?

508
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,000
He's kind, funny and handsome.

509
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,800
I wanna tell you that...

510
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:19,920
I won't give up.
