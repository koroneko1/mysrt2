0
00:05:21,973 --> 00:05:23,671
Ah! It's hot.

1
00:05:26,369 --> 00:05:27,457
Why such a hurry?

2
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:47,782
I'm going to the old lab.

3
00:06:24,514 --> 00:06:27,778
Ugh... I hate this place.

4
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:42,010
Careful up here.

5
00:07:34,062 --> 00:07:35,585
Look what I found.

6
00:07:37,761 --> 00:07:39,981
Enough Vesper,
my battery is low.

7
00:07:43,985 --> 00:07:45,987
Nobody forced you to come.

8
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,468
You should have stayed home
to charge.

9
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:01,306
You're wasting our time
on these experiments.

10
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,582
Don't worry.

11
00:08:16,974 --> 00:08:18,541
It won't hurt.

12
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,127
Thank you.

13
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:43,261
Wait here.

14
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:06,589
It's just a pilgrim.
Come on.

15
00:09:22,126 --> 00:09:24,651
- I think it's a "she".
- Leave it.

16
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,426
One day, I'd like to follow one,

17
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,690
find out where
they're taking all that junk.

18
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:06,606
Don't.
They just wander until they die.

19
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:10,131
How do you know
they never come home?

20
00:10:10,174 --> 00:10:12,394
Everyone knows it.

21
00:10:12,437 --> 00:10:15,310
How could anyone know
about all of them?

22
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:18,313
Vesper.
She's not coming back.

23
00:10:31,805 --> 00:10:33,589
Is there anyone in there
with you?

24
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:38,594
I think they're gone.

25
00:10:39,377 --> 00:10:40,901
I don't hear anything.

26
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:28,818
Vesper, the tank!

27
00:11:59,457 --> 00:12:00,720
The power!

28
00:12:13,471 --> 00:12:15,691
Get the back up from the fridge.

29
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,302
I took it out...

30
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,915
I needed space
for my cell cultures.

31
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:34,449
I'll go to Jonas.

32
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,123
Who is in charge?

33
00:13:45,912 --> 00:13:47,696
Who is in charge?

34
00:13:48,436 --> 00:13:49,524
Me...

35
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,700
But they didn't attach the po...

36
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,704
The Jug was your responsibility.

37
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:01,144
Now put the poor creature
out of its misery.

38
00:14:22,426 --> 00:14:23,906
It's not human.

39
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,690
It won't feel a thing.

40
00:14:27,562 --> 00:14:29,390
It was made in a lab.

41
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:51,646
That Jug might have cost you
a fortune. What a waste.

42
00:15:51,689 --> 00:15:54,562
- What brings you, Vesper?
- You know.

43
00:15:54,605 --> 00:15:58,174
How would I? You're holed up
in that shack with my brother.

44
00:15:58,218 --> 00:16:00,916
Someone sabotaged our generator.

45
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,135
Is that so?

46
00:16:03,179 --> 00:16:04,528
What a world.

47
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,836
All our bacteria's gone.

48
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:10,186
We have no power.

49
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,275
Il you know we can't do charity.

50
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:15,713
I'm not asking for any.

51
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:28,378
Believe me, we work for it.

52
00:16:29,075 --> 00:16:31,991
Family has to stick together
to survive out here,

53
00:16:32,034 --> 00:16:36,865
especially with the Citadel
raising the price of seeds.

54
00:16:36,908 --> 00:16:39,302
Fortunately,
we have what they want.

55
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:44,089
Skinny!

56
00:16:44,786 --> 00:16:46,744
Look who's come to see us.

57
00:17:21,866 --> 00:17:24,086
Your blood won't be young
for ever.

58
00:17:26,132 --> 00:17:28,699
Shame to waste it all
on emergencies like this.

59
00:17:31,398 --> 00:17:32,616
But of course,

60
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,358
living alone as you do,

61
00:17:35,402 --> 00:17:37,273
you're lucky
it hasn't been worse.

62
00:17:37,752 --> 00:17:41,234
Pilgrims, drifters, bandits...

63
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,540
They come to your door,

64
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:46,500
and it can all end in tragedy.

65
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:49,503
You'd be safer here.

66
00:17:50,895 --> 00:17:52,375
What about my father?

67
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:54,986
We would take care of him.

68
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,424
It's not his fault
your mother left.

69
00:17:59,643 --> 00:18:01,602
You'd both be more comfortable,

70
00:18:03,734 --> 00:18:05,519
especially during the winter.

71
00:18:08,174 --> 00:18:10,480
You remind me so much
of your mother.

72
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:21,230
I hope you're not afraid of me?

73
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:27,367
I'm not going to become just
another one of your breeders.

74
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,590
You say it
like it's a dirty word.

75
00:18:36,724 --> 00:18:38,508
Think you're better
than everyone?

76
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:40,162
I have skills.

77
00:18:40,989 --> 00:18:42,512
I taught myself.

78
00:18:43,209 --> 00:18:44,775
And one day I'll get out.

79
00:18:45,776 --> 00:18:46,776
But you...

80
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:49,215
You'll still be here,

81
00:18:50,041 --> 00:18:52,087
sucking your kids' blood
to trade for seeds.

82
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,351
My ambitious little girl.

83
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,790
You know we are so alike,
you and I.

84
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:05,492
Because we won't let this world
of shit crush us, will we?

85
00:19:10,584 --> 00:19:13,891
But don't think you can change
the order of things.

86
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,984
Take every opportunity
as it comes to you.

87
00:19:32,649 --> 00:19:34,434
Can I have my bacteria now?

88
00:19:35,739 --> 00:19:38,220
You'll have to come back
in two days' time.

89
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:42,181
I need to sell your blood
to the Citadel, first.

90
00:19:42,224 --> 00:19:44,748
You know Papa won't survive
that long without energy.

91
00:19:44,792 --> 00:19:46,576
I wish I had some more to spare.

92
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:53,234
No!

93
00:19:54,018 --> 00:19:56,195
No!

94
00:19:56,804 --> 00:19:58,588
No! No!

95
00:23:58,132 --> 00:24:00,526
You won't be mad anymore
when you see what I got.

96
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,197
What is this?
Where did you get that?

97
00:24:20,241 --> 00:24:22,722
- Jonas gave me.
- For what?

98
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:26,595
- What did you do to get them?
- Nothing.

99
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,730
I just took them.

100
00:24:30,773 --> 00:24:32,601
Put them back before he notices.

101
00:24:34,124 --> 00:24:35,386
No.

102
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:39,260
They're mine,
and I'm going to unlock them.

103
00:24:39,303 --> 00:24:41,915
- Make them fertile.
- You know that's not possible.

104
00:24:41,958 --> 00:24:45,353
Once I do, the Citadel will
want me to work in their labs.

105
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:47,703
They'll never let you
work inside.

106
00:24:47,747 --> 00:24:50,314
You're just afraid
that I'll leave, like Mum!

107
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:53,448
Oh Vesper,

108
00:24:54,623 --> 00:24:56,886
you don't know
the cost of dreams.

109
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:58,932
Shut up!

110
00:25:00,977 --> 00:25:02,544
- Your place is here.
- Shut up!

111
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:06,119
I saw a wing-glider last night.

112
00:28:07,598 --> 00:28:09,165
Maybe it crashed.

113
00:28:13,866 --> 00:28:16,477
Wouldn't you want to help?
If it were you?

114
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,609
Dump her back
where you found her.

115
00:28:18,653 --> 00:28:20,655
She's not our responsibility.

116
00:28:32,536 --> 00:28:35,365
Maybe she could help us.

117
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:37,150
Oh, no...

118
00:28:37,193 --> 00:28:40,109
You think she's going to take us
to the Citadel.

119
00:28:40,849 --> 00:28:43,069
These people do not act
out of kindness.

120
00:28:44,635 --> 00:28:46,768
What does she have to gain
by bringing you?

121
00:28:47,377 --> 00:28:48,552
Maybe...

122
00:28:49,379 --> 00:28:51,599
- The labs.
- Nothing.

123
00:28:53,035 --> 00:28:54,863
Do you want to blow us up?

124
00:28:54,907 --> 00:28:56,996
Would you prefer
that I left her there to die?

125
00:28:57,648 --> 00:28:58,648
Yes!

126
00:29:22,673 --> 00:29:24,066
Where is the man I was with?

127
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:26,329
You were alone.

128
00:29:28,288 --> 00:29:31,073
I need to find him.

129
00:29:31,117 --> 00:29:32,988
He might be injured,
our glider crashed.

130
00:29:33,032 --> 00:29:35,034
Can you take me
to where you found me?

131
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:38,777
You're not going
to get very far.

132
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:48,699
Can you help me?

133
00:29:50,876 --> 00:29:52,529
Can you help me?

134
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:03,802
You can go.

135
00:30:04,324 --> 00:30:06,674
You can get help.
You can search for him.

136
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:09,155
We're not your servants.

137
00:30:09,198 --> 00:30:12,941
Yes. Please forgive my manners.

138
00:30:12,985 --> 00:30:15,770
The man is my father
and I'm scared for him.

139
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:19,208
Any help you provide
will not go unrewarded.

140
00:30:19,252 --> 00:30:20,949
We have helped.

141
00:30:20,993 --> 00:30:23,386
Did you call the Citadel?
Are they coming?

142
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,910
I don't know.

143
00:30:24,953 --> 00:30:26,999
I fell from the glider
before it crashed.

144
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:28,696
- Pap.
- No!

145
00:30:28,739 --> 00:30:30,393
You can't stop me.

146
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:33,527
Do what you want,
but don't come crying to me.

147
00:30:35,311 --> 00:30:36,660
I'm Camellia.

148
00:30:38,053 --> 00:30:39,185
Vesper.

149
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:41,796
You will not regret helping us.

150
00:30:42,492 --> 00:30:43,754
You have my word.

151
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:45,800
We'll start at sunrise.

152
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:49,282
- It's not safe at night.
- Thank you.

153
00:31:27,755 --> 00:31:29,539
I gave you the juiciest ones.

154
00:31:38,809 --> 00:31:39,854
Thank you.

155
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:48,428
Who lives here with you?

156
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:51,866
Just... me and Pap.

157
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:56,349
The... cranky drone.

158
00:31:58,133 --> 00:32:00,614
He uses it to communicate.

159
00:32:00,657 --> 00:32:02,703
What happened to him?

160
00:32:03,878 --> 00:32:06,489
He got hurt, serving for the...

161
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,709
Citadel's army.

162
00:32:10,015 --> 00:32:13,627
All they gave him
was that old scrap drone.

163
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,803
If we brought you both
to the Citadel,

164
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:17,631
I'm sure they could help him.

165
00:32:17,674 --> 00:32:19,415
Really? You...

166
00:32:20,329 --> 00:32:21,765
You could do that?

167
00:32:21,809 --> 00:32:22,809
Um-hum.

168
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:26,335
My father is
a very influential man.

169
00:32:28,424 --> 00:32:29,773
You hear that Pap?

170
00:32:32,167 --> 00:32:33,212
Pap?

171
00:32:41,176 --> 00:32:44,005
Pap, Pap, Pap!

172
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:46,616
Stop!

173
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,966
Pap, no.

174
00:32:48,009 --> 00:32:51,317
Pap! Pap! Pap!

175
00:32:52,144 --> 00:32:55,234
No, stop. Stop it! Pap!

176
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:58,628
Stop, Pap.

177
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:01,718
Stop, Pap. Please. Stop!

178
00:33:01,762 --> 00:33:04,460
- Please, stop.
- Keep hold of him.

179
00:33:29,137 --> 00:33:30,704
He's sleeping now.

180
00:34:10,744 --> 00:34:12,485
What did she do to you?

181
00:34:12,528 --> 00:34:13,921
I don't know.

182
00:34:15,966 --> 00:34:18,273
Can everyone
from the Citadel do that?

183
00:34:18,317 --> 00:34:19,579
I don't think so.

184
00:34:20,667 --> 00:34:22,625
Lucky she was there.

185
00:34:24,584 --> 00:34:26,020
She's awake now.

186
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,259
Vesper?

187
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:17,349
I expected to find pilgrims.

188
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,876
This man needs help.

189
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,186
- Good to see you, Darius.
- Jonas.

190
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:30,188
I see you got your power back.

191
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:33,843
I found backup supply.

192
00:36:34,366 --> 00:36:35,715
How fortunate.

193
00:36:37,151 --> 00:36:38,892
We still owe you for that blood.

194
00:36:39,545 --> 00:36:41,460
You should come and see us.

195
00:36:51,731 --> 00:36:53,036
Bring me...

196
00:36:54,734 --> 00:36:55,952
Bring me...

197
00:37:03,133 --> 00:37:06,398
Why has no one from the Citadel
come to find you?

198
00:37:06,833 --> 00:37:08,095
Camel...

199
00:37:10,184 --> 00:37:11,620
Close blinds...

200
00:37:15,407 --> 00:37:17,017
Lay with me.

201
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:23,545
I've always wondered...

202
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:28,550
What do you do
with my children's blood?

203
00:37:31,771 --> 00:37:34,556
Do you use it
to make your own more special?

204
00:37:47,221 --> 00:37:48,221
Help.

205
00:37:49,702 --> 00:37:50,703
Please.

206
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:58,406
You're suffering?

207
00:38:03,324 --> 00:38:05,544
- Now you know how it feels.
- No!

208
00:38:07,676 --> 00:38:10,549
No! No!

209
00:38:11,985 --> 00:38:14,074
No! No!

210
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,339
No! No!

211
00:38:21,429 --> 00:38:23,953
No! Let him!

212
00:38:28,393 --> 00:38:29,568
No.

213
00:38:30,395 --> 00:38:31,526
No...

214
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,703
No. No...

215
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:48,500
Take it apart.

216
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,938
Salvage what's good.

217
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,682
What's bothering you?

218
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:00,425
Did this man
mean anything to you?

219
00:39:19,531 --> 00:39:21,184
There was another passenger.

220
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:35,373
How did you find this?

221
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,595
We were foraging.

222
00:39:41,204 --> 00:39:43,685
What, you just...
stumbled on it?

223
00:39:47,776 --> 00:39:49,430
Why won't you look at me?

224
00:39:49,474 --> 00:39:51,693
Because she's afraid of you!

225
00:39:51,737 --> 00:39:53,260
Let's go, Vesper.

226
00:39:54,522 --> 00:39:55,741
No.

227
00:39:56,655 --> 00:39:58,047
You don't just leave.

228
00:39:58,961 --> 00:40:01,224
Not without helping
to clean up first.

229
00:40:36,042 --> 00:40:37,826
We say we didn't find anything.

230
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,698
Can't lie to her for ever.

231
00:40:39,741 --> 00:40:41,961
Jonas is looking for her.

232
00:40:42,004 --> 00:40:44,964
It would be dangerous
if she did anything rash.

233
00:40:45,007 --> 00:40:46,966
We have to inform the Citadel.

234
00:40:47,009 --> 00:40:49,882
Jonas is the only one
with a transceiver.

235
00:40:49,925 --> 00:40:50,925
So?

236
00:40:52,058 --> 00:40:54,103
You've never snuck
into his farm before?

237
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:02,982
Did you find him?

238
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,290
We didn't find anything.

239
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:13,383
But how...

240
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:17,083
The wing-glider couldn't have
crashed so far away.

241
00:41:17,866 --> 00:41:21,653
The area is...
It's really big.

242
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,135
We'll go tomorrow.

243
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:28,660
We need to inform
the Citadel about the crash.

244
00:41:30,313 --> 00:41:32,446
Our neighbour has a transceiver.

245
00:41:32,881 --> 00:41:34,579
We'll go in the morning.

246
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:38,234
Yes.

247
00:41:39,453 --> 00:41:40,715
All right.

248
00:41:42,325 --> 00:41:43,501
Let's do that.

249
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,078
Your leg.

250
00:41:56,818 --> 00:41:58,777
You've almost stopped limping.

251
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:00,213
Can I see?

252
00:42:05,044 --> 00:42:06,306
You made that?

253
00:42:07,394 --> 00:42:08,482
I did it for him.

254
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:11,354
To protect his open sores,
but...

255
00:42:11,398 --> 00:42:14,096
It doesn't speed up
the healing process.

256
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:19,754
I didn't know people here knew
so much about synthetic biology.

257
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:22,757
The vermin have brains, too.

258
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:25,325
This is nothing.

259
00:42:28,197 --> 00:42:31,200
- Come with me.
- Vesper, it's not safe.

260
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:33,986
She needs to see my work
if she takes us to the Citadel.

261
00:42:35,335 --> 00:42:36,336
Let's go.

262
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:49,801
The little ones always greet me.

263
00:44:18,307 --> 00:44:19,569
She likes you.

264
00:44:37,892 --> 00:44:40,155
This is the first one I created.

265
00:44:45,813 --> 00:44:49,599
He's sulking, because I haven't
been here for a few days.

266
00:44:51,732 --> 00:44:54,430
He is not the best looking,
but...

267
00:44:55,301 --> 00:44:56,694
He has character.

268
00:44:57,869 --> 00:44:58,957
Like Pap.

269
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:04,310
Come on.

270
00:45:54,316 --> 00:45:57,929
They're safer here,
but I hope one day,

271
00:45:57,972 --> 00:46:00,888
they make their way out
into the world.

272
00:46:02,455 --> 00:46:04,762
I've never seen
anything like it.

273
00:46:07,895 --> 00:46:09,636
We have to show Elias.

274
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,203
Who?

275
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:14,772
My father.

276
00:46:16,382 --> 00:46:19,515
He's the synthetic biology head,
at the Citadel.

277
00:46:20,908 --> 00:46:22,692
He would love this.

278
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:25,434
I'm still learning.

279
00:46:26,914 --> 00:46:30,222
The first ones
didn't even survive,

280
00:46:30,265 --> 00:46:32,311
or, they killed each other.

281
00:46:34,139 --> 00:46:36,054
But I'm getting closer

282
00:46:36,097 --> 00:46:38,970
to the right assembly
with each generation.

283
00:46:42,582 --> 00:46:44,627
I still make mistakes though.

284
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:48,980
This one should be blue
like the others.

285
00:46:51,852 --> 00:46:54,072
Something must have changed
my original code.

286
00:46:56,814 --> 00:47:00,426
Let's find out why you don't do
what you're supposed to.

287
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:04,125
We both know
I won't make it to the Citadel.

288
00:47:04,169 --> 00:47:07,781
But the kid trusts you.
It's everything to her.

289
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:39,595
When did your mother pass away?

290
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:44,644
She's not dead.

291
00:47:46,341 --> 00:47:47,734
She left us a year ago.

292
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,563
Followed the pilgrims.

293
00:47:52,652 --> 00:47:54,393
Who are the pilgrims?

294
00:47:56,525 --> 00:47:58,223
They wander in groups

295
00:47:58,266 --> 00:48:00,616
with veils over their faces,
scavenging old junk.

296
00:48:02,967 --> 00:48:04,490
No one knows why.

297
00:48:05,447 --> 00:48:07,058
They don't talk.

298
00:48:07,841 --> 00:48:09,756
Why did she follow them?

299
00:48:11,845 --> 00:48:13,629
Pap said she dreamed too much.

300
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:17,590
Got sad staying here.

301
00:48:22,073 --> 00:48:23,248
She...

302
00:48:24,989 --> 00:48:27,382
She scribed
these beautiful songs.

303
00:48:29,515 --> 00:48:31,691
When she sang,
it made me feel...

304
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:35,608
Warm.

305
00:48:38,089 --> 00:48:39,786
One morning, I...

306
00:48:41,005 --> 00:48:42,223
I went to her,

307
00:48:43,268 --> 00:48:45,313
asking her to sing, but...

308
00:48:46,488 --> 00:48:48,012
She'd lost her voice.

309
00:48:50,797 --> 00:48:52,581
Two days later she was gone.

310
00:49:00,459 --> 00:49:02,069
Some people say...

311
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,595
That it's a virus
that makes them pilgrims.

312
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:10,686
She'd never have left you
if she had a choice.

313
00:49:24,831 --> 00:49:26,528
What about yours?

314
00:49:32,447 --> 00:49:33,666
I never met her.

315
00:49:37,104 --> 00:49:38,845
Maybe it's better like that.

316
00:50:29,243 --> 00:50:30,679
Do they exist for real?

317
00:50:32,333 --> 00:50:34,031
They did, a long time ago.

318
00:50:35,771 --> 00:50:39,906
Is it true that
the Citadel can generate any...

319
00:50:39,949 --> 00:50:41,603
- Any life form?
- Hm.

320
00:50:48,219 --> 00:50:50,351
- Have you ever seen this one?
- Um-hum.

321
00:50:51,526 --> 00:50:54,007
That's a cat.
They're very independent.

322
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:57,010
Does it make a sound?

323
00:50:59,099 --> 00:51:00,099
Yeah.

324
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,588
- What about this one?
- That's an owl.

325
00:51:09,631 --> 00:51:12,156
They fly and they go...

326
00:51:26,083 --> 00:51:29,347
- This one?
- That's a parrot.

327
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:31,653
They repeat everything you say.

328
00:51:32,393 --> 00:51:33,786
- What?
- What?

329
00:51:34,743 --> 00:51:36,702
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

330
00:51:36,745 --> 00:51:39,096
- Oh, I get it.
- Oh, I get it.

331
00:51:40,358 --> 00:51:41,924
- Stop now.
- Stop now.

332
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:43,274
- Stop.
- Stop.

333
00:51:44,013 --> 00:51:46,842
- Stop it. Stop it now.
- Stop it. Stop it now.

334
00:51:46,886 --> 00:51:48,279
- Stop.
- Stop.

335
00:51:48,670 --> 00:51:50,716
- Stop, Camellia.
- Stop, Camellia.

336
00:51:50,759 --> 00:51:54,241
- Stop it. Stop it.
- Stop it. Stop it.

337
00:51:54,285 --> 00:51:57,505
- Stop. Actually stop.
- Stop. Actually stop.

338
00:51:57,549 --> 00:51:59,551
- Stop. Stop.
- Stop. Stop.

339
00:52:05,252 --> 00:52:06,819
This is a wolf.

340
00:52:07,254 --> 00:52:08,951
They travel in packs.

341
00:52:08,995 --> 00:52:12,303
And they like
to howl at the moon.

342
00:52:46,902 --> 00:52:50,167
Why is the Citadel so closed-off
to people like us?

343
00:52:54,127 --> 00:52:57,391
If they opened its doors to all,
there'd not be enough resources.

344
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,526
But...

345
00:53:01,569 --> 00:53:04,790
You're creating Jugs
to serve you.

346
00:53:06,444 --> 00:53:08,141
We could do their work.

347
00:53:10,839 --> 00:53:12,711
The Citadel likes control.

348
00:53:13,668 --> 00:53:15,714
Jugs are designed to be loyal.

349
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:19,239
It wouldn't be so easy
with humans.

350
00:53:58,626 --> 00:54:00,149
Hum something.

351
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:16,356
He'll be busy with them.

352
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,315
I'll check if it's clear.

353
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,817
Come on in, Vesper.

354
00:55:56,048 --> 00:55:58,485
The gyroscope wasn't
working properly.

355
00:55:59,094 --> 00:56:00,531
I'm fixing it for you.

356
00:56:06,450 --> 00:56:08,539
What brings you two here?

357
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:15,240
Vesper.

358
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:19,767
Why are you trespassing
on my farm?

359
00:56:21,943 --> 00:56:25,251
We came to get what you owe us,
for the blood.

360
00:56:25,294 --> 00:56:27,558
Well there's no need
to sneak through the back.

361
00:56:28,210 --> 00:56:30,387
Last time,
your kids threw rocks at me.

362
00:56:31,257 --> 00:56:33,128
Things have been
a bit tense here.

363
00:56:35,348 --> 00:56:38,133
A few days ago, our germinating
seeds disappeared...

364
00:56:39,178 --> 00:56:40,658
Skinny was watching them.

365
00:56:41,789 --> 00:56:43,704
He said that bugs took them.

366
00:56:44,879 --> 00:56:45,880
Imagine?

367
00:56:50,450 --> 00:56:53,322
I had to send him away
to think about that.

368
00:56:56,282 --> 00:56:58,110
If you can't trust
your family...

369
00:57:04,159 --> 00:57:06,640
Do you really think
bugs stole those seeds?

370
00:57:10,296 --> 00:57:11,428
Hold here.

371
00:57:21,699 --> 00:57:24,832
If I caught a bug stealing
from my family's stockpile,

372
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:27,269
I'd tear off his wings,

373
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:30,316
each little tiny leg.

374
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:42,328
And what about
the extra passenger?

375
00:57:44,373 --> 00:57:45,679
You've seen anything?

376
00:57:49,814 --> 00:57:52,730
I have lost all patience
with liars.

377
00:57:57,691 --> 00:57:59,606
The drone is as good as new.

378
00:58:05,133 --> 00:58:07,396
But we don't do charity here.

379
00:58:47,393 --> 00:58:48,699
Are you hungry?

380
00:59:08,283 --> 00:59:09,633
Can you fly?

381
00:59:18,119 --> 00:59:19,686
What did he do to you?

382
00:59:21,514 --> 00:59:22,602
Fly one more time.

383
01:00:51,865 --> 01:00:53,432
No!

384
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:04,791
No! No!

385
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,124
What happened?

386
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:39,260
Vesper?

387
01:01:45,353 --> 01:01:47,094
Did you contact the Citadel?

388
01:01:53,971 --> 01:01:55,363
Vesper.

389
01:02:02,501 --> 01:02:04,590
- Hey, just take a moment.
- No!

390
01:02:06,461 --> 01:02:08,028
- Vesper!
- No.

391
01:02:20,693 --> 01:02:23,740
- What if it can't be fixed?
- Of course it can.

392
01:02:25,524 --> 01:02:26,699
You'll find a way.

393
01:02:28,179 --> 01:02:29,179
I promise.

394
01:02:30,007 --> 01:02:32,357
And then we can go
look for Elias

395
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:36,622
because I'm feeling
so much better. Hm?

396
01:02:40,408 --> 01:02:41,714
He's dead.

397
01:03:03,388 --> 01:03:04,563
Show me.

398
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:40,033
No, no, no!

399
01:03:41,165 --> 01:03:42,644
No, no, no!

400
01:03:50,391 --> 01:03:51,915
No, no, no!

401
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:47,448
You're a...

402
01:04:48,101 --> 01:04:49,363
I'm a Jug, yeah.

403
01:04:52,932 --> 01:04:55,674
But, I've seen a Jug before...

404
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,807
It wasn't like you.

405
01:04:58,851 --> 01:05:00,592
He created me.

406
01:05:02,072 --> 01:05:03,377
I'm different.

407
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,861
You can't get us
into the Citadel.

408
01:05:10,863 --> 01:05:13,387
We were escaping the Citadel
when we crashed.

409
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:18,218
Creating an intelligent Jug
is a major crime.

410
01:05:18,827 --> 01:05:20,003
They'd kill me.

411
01:05:22,135 --> 01:05:24,137
Elias made a deal

412
01:05:24,181 --> 01:05:26,879
with another Citadel
for refugee status.

413
01:05:28,663 --> 01:05:30,796
You were never going to take us.

414
01:06:08,486 --> 01:06:10,749
Get cleaned up. Go!

415
01:07:20,558 --> 01:07:23,648
Vesper, I'm sorry.

416
01:07:27,956 --> 01:07:30,220
I never felt so worthless.

417
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:43,668
Try to fly.

418
01:07:47,019 --> 01:07:48,673
You can't stay here.

419
01:07:48,716 --> 01:07:50,283
Jonas marked you.

420
01:07:50,805 --> 01:07:52,894
He thinks you belong to him now.

421
01:07:54,505 --> 01:07:56,159
We're not going anywhere, Pap.

422
01:07:59,466 --> 01:08:00,815
She's a Jug.

423
01:08:03,383 --> 01:08:04,689
She lied to us.

424
01:08:07,735 --> 01:08:09,302
You were right.

425
01:08:12,349 --> 01:08:14,699
I'm going to take her to Jonas.

426
01:08:15,874 --> 01:08:18,442
Then maybe he'll go easier
on me.

427
01:08:19,791 --> 01:08:21,575
Don't be too hard on her.

428
01:08:21,619 --> 01:08:23,751
Jugs obey their masters.

429
01:08:24,491 --> 01:08:26,406
She didn't have a choice.

430
01:09:42,961 --> 01:09:44,615
Stop!

431
01:10:08,813 --> 01:10:11,250
I don't exist anymore.

432
01:10:13,948 --> 01:10:17,343
You don't just get to give up
when things are hard.

433
01:10:19,389 --> 01:10:21,347
They're hard for all of us,

434
01:10:22,130 --> 01:10:23,349
but we stay,

435
01:10:25,656 --> 01:10:27,397
and we help each other.

436
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:38,669
Follow me.

437
01:10:51,116 --> 01:10:52,160
Sit.

438
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:59,255
I found out why it wasn't doing
what it was supposed to.

439
01:11:00,517 --> 01:11:04,347
It's met a fungus
with an orange pigment.

440
01:11:05,348 --> 01:11:09,221
They joined
and made something new.

441
01:11:10,962 --> 01:11:13,443
If a flower can change
its purpose,

442
01:11:14,095 --> 01:11:15,271
so can you.

443
01:11:30,895 --> 01:11:31,895
What?

444
01:11:35,813 --> 01:11:37,597
Could I study a sample of you?

445
01:12:03,754 --> 01:12:04,754
Camellia?

446
01:12:06,409 --> 01:12:07,627
Camellia?

447
01:12:19,726 --> 01:12:21,337
See this part here.

448
01:12:22,555 --> 01:12:24,122
It keeps repeating,

449
01:12:24,165 --> 01:12:26,559
but it doesn't belong
to your core DNA.

450
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:32,260
- What is it?
- It's locked.

451
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:34,872
Elias didn't tell me anything.

452
01:12:55,066 --> 01:12:57,155
I used to play for Elias
when he was working,

453
01:12:57,198 --> 01:12:59,200
he said
it helped him concentrate.

454
01:13:00,027 --> 01:13:02,073
He was in a Citadel lab.

455
01:13:03,466 --> 01:13:06,077
With their technology,
this would be easy.

456
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,384
You wouldn't like it
in the Citadel.

457
01:13:11,691 --> 01:13:14,302
Elias used to say life there
was like a frozen river,

458
01:13:14,346 --> 01:13:16,043
the surface was beautiful,

459
01:13:17,393 --> 01:13:18,655
but underneath...

460
01:13:21,309 --> 01:13:23,573
Everyone tries to live for ever,

461
01:13:23,616 --> 01:13:25,575
and it's a joyless
and a lonely life.

462
01:13:26,489 --> 01:13:27,751
You lived there.

463
01:13:29,796 --> 01:13:31,189
I lived for Elias.

464
01:13:34,758 --> 01:13:37,021
I entertained him,
I took care of him.

465
01:13:39,632 --> 01:13:41,721
I let him take care of me.

466
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:47,423
I kept him warm,

467
01:13:48,293 --> 01:13:49,555
I helped him sleep...

468
01:13:57,781 --> 01:13:59,652
I did everything he told me to.

469
01:14:54,272 --> 01:14:55,316
Camellia?

470
01:14:57,580 --> 01:14:59,756
No. Keep playing.

471
01:15:07,024 --> 01:15:09,635
There, that last note,
keep playing that.

472
01:15:25,608 --> 01:15:27,087
Look.

473
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:32,136
These,
the DNA sequences of plants...

474
01:15:33,659 --> 01:15:36,357
There are so many,
I don't get it.

475
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:39,665
Wait.

476
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:20,445
Pap!

477
01:16:25,972 --> 01:16:28,888
I found the key
to unlock the Citadel seeds.

478
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,587
I can make them fertile.

479
01:16:32,544 --> 01:16:34,154
We'll never starve again.

480
01:16:37,636 --> 01:16:39,420
So that was his plan:

481
01:16:40,421 --> 01:16:43,599
to trade them for entrance
to the other Citadel.

482
01:16:44,469 --> 01:16:46,863
You need
to take Vesper there tomorrow.

483
01:16:48,038 --> 01:16:49,517
- No.
- Vesper.

484
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:50,910
- Pap.
- You...

485
01:16:50,954 --> 01:16:52,782
I'm not leaving you.

486
01:16:52,825 --> 01:16:56,655
You don't understand,
the Citadel will be ruthless.

487
01:16:56,699 --> 01:17:00,354
I need new filters.
We have to go to the old lab.

488
01:17:17,284 --> 01:17:19,765
You won't believe
what I'm about to do.

489
01:18:10,860 --> 01:18:14,254
I'm so relieved
to finally find you, Miss.

490
01:18:14,298 --> 01:18:15,560
And you are?

491
01:18:17,954 --> 01:18:19,651
Where are my manners?

492
01:18:20,913 --> 01:18:22,741
My name is Jonas.

493
01:18:25,265 --> 01:18:26,745
I'm his brother.

494
01:18:31,881 --> 01:18:33,883
If you come back with me,

495
01:18:34,405 --> 01:18:36,581
I can help get you home.

496
01:18:36,624 --> 01:18:39,671
We've contacted the Citadel,
they're on their way.

497
01:18:41,673 --> 01:18:43,806
Either you're mistaken, or...

498
01:18:47,331 --> 01:18:49,333
Someone isn't truth-telling.

499
01:18:54,164 --> 01:18:58,734
I'm the only person in this area
with a transceiver.

500
01:19:00,605 --> 01:19:02,694
You have to be really careful

501
01:19:04,565 --> 01:19:06,306
who you trust.

502
01:19:08,134 --> 01:19:09,614
My place is more...

503
01:19:10,615 --> 01:19:12,748
appropriate for a lady.

504
01:19:13,923 --> 01:19:17,317
It's bigger, more comfortable.

505
01:19:23,846 --> 01:19:25,717
It doesn't smell of death.

506
01:19:29,503 --> 01:19:32,028
I'll go with you.

507
01:20:10,066 --> 01:20:11,719
Unbelievable!

508
01:20:15,636 --> 01:20:17,508
You're practically human.

509
01:20:20,598 --> 01:20:23,862
- A Jug needs a master.
- I have one.

510
01:20:23,906 --> 01:20:26,691
Not anymore, you don't.

511
01:21:00,203 --> 01:21:01,726
You think I'm stupid?

512
01:21:10,082 --> 01:21:13,085
Vesper stop! Stop that! Stop it!

513
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:19,613
No, no, don't.

514
01:21:19,657 --> 01:21:21,267
Jonas, no!

515
01:21:26,707 --> 01:21:27,707
Drop it.

516
01:21:51,254 --> 01:21:53,038
So this is how it ends.

517
01:22:20,283 --> 01:22:21,980
I want to make a deal.

518
01:23:06,372 --> 01:23:08,679
Camellia's owner was
an engineer.

519
01:23:11,769 --> 01:23:15,642
He hid the codes to
unlock the seeds inside her DNA.

520
01:23:24,738 --> 01:23:26,653
I can make them fertile.

521
01:23:39,057 --> 01:23:41,625
We'll both have
all the food we need.

522
01:24:10,654 --> 01:24:12,917
I found the Jug
you're looking for.

523
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,404
This will mix
with the seeds' cells

524
01:24:21,447 --> 01:24:23,580
and change their DNA.

525
01:24:23,623 --> 01:24:25,060
How long will it take?

526
01:24:58,354 --> 01:24:59,703
It worked.

527
01:25:02,793 --> 01:25:06,101
This little one
can change our entire lives.

528
01:25:30,777 --> 01:25:32,605
Away from the window.

529
01:25:55,237 --> 01:25:56,499
Vesper...

530
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:28,748
Leave it.

531
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,696
Don't breathe it.

532
01:27:24,587 --> 01:27:26,545
They'll be here soon.

533
01:27:27,459 --> 01:27:28,721
I'll turn myself in.

534
01:27:30,332 --> 01:27:32,377
It's too late for that.
They know we've helped you.

535
01:27:32,421 --> 01:27:34,161
You and Vesper have to go now.

536
01:27:34,205 --> 01:27:35,205
No!

537
01:27:36,381 --> 01:27:38,340
- We're not leaving you here.
- Don't argue.

538
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:40,820
I can buy you
enough time to escape.

539
01:27:46,609 --> 01:27:48,350
Look at me.

540
01:27:53,398 --> 01:27:57,272
You and Camellia must go
to the Citadel in the south.

541
01:27:57,315 --> 01:27:59,056
Trade the seeds for safety.

542
01:27:59,099 --> 01:28:01,711
No, I don't want any of this.

543
01:28:02,712 --> 01:28:04,714
I'll give them the seeds.

544
01:28:04,757 --> 01:28:06,759
It doesn't work that way.

545
01:28:06,803 --> 01:28:08,631
I'm not leaving you here.

546
01:28:10,415 --> 01:28:11,634
Vesper.

547
01:28:13,984 --> 01:28:15,507
How about this?

548
01:28:17,379 --> 01:28:18,597
We'll trick them.

549
01:28:22,601 --> 01:28:25,735
You'll hide in the swamp
and I'll tell them you're gone,

550
01:28:26,475 --> 01:28:28,694
and when it's over
you can come back.

551
01:28:29,913 --> 01:28:34,091
I've worked for these people.
I know how to talk to them.

552
01:28:36,354 --> 01:28:37,399
Besides,

553
01:28:38,922 --> 01:28:41,316
how can they hurt me any more?

554
01:28:43,622 --> 01:28:45,885
We could hide you from them,
too.

555
01:28:45,929 --> 01:28:47,234
There you go.

556
01:28:49,759 --> 01:28:51,543
That's a great idea.

557
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:13,391
Promise you'll take care of her.

558
01:31:58,817 --> 01:32:01,080
No, no.

559
01:32:01,124 --> 01:32:03,605
No! No!

560
01:32:05,171 --> 01:32:09,480
- I'm sorry. Come.
- No!

561
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:11,830
- Come here. I'm sorry.
- No, no!

562
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,531
No. No.

563
01:32:16,922 --> 01:32:18,750
He'll always be with you.

564
01:32:20,143 --> 01:32:22,841
He'll always be with you.

565
01:32:22,885 --> 01:32:23,885
Vesper.

566
01:32:25,322 --> 01:32:27,498
He told us to go to your garden,

567
01:32:27,542 --> 01:32:30,762
and then when it's safe
we go south to the Citadel.

568
01:32:30,806 --> 01:32:31,806
OK?

569
01:32:32,634 --> 01:32:33,896
Come on.

570
01:32:35,419 --> 01:32:36,942
Come on.

571
01:32:59,965 --> 01:33:01,401
Come on.

572
01:33:05,492 --> 01:33:06,493
Run.

573
01:33:10,019 --> 01:33:11,847
Don't touch the red grass.

574
01:35:46,697 --> 01:35:48,003
I'll go with you.

575
01:36:10,068 --> 01:36:11,461
Hey!

576
01:37:18,180 --> 01:37:20,356
They won't stop until they get
me.

577
01:37:23,489 --> 01:37:24,621
No.

578
01:37:25,013 --> 01:37:26,188
Pap said...

579
01:37:27,189 --> 01:37:28,886
We have to stay together.

580
01:37:29,844 --> 01:37:31,541
You can't just leave me.

581
01:37:35,893 --> 01:37:39,201
Vesper, do you remember
what you said about the seeds?

582
01:37:40,376 --> 01:37:43,858
How just one could change
everything?

583
01:37:43,901 --> 01:37:45,860
- No.
- Vesper.

584
01:37:45,903 --> 01:37:47,774
- You can't do this.
- It's OK.

585
01:37:47,818 --> 01:37:50,255
You're coming with me.

586
01:37:50,299 --> 01:37:54,564
You're going to stay with me,
and that is it!

587
01:37:54,607 --> 01:37:56,958
You have to do what I say.

588
01:37:57,654 --> 01:38:01,701
It's an order, I'm ordering you,
and you will stay with me.

589
01:38:01,745 --> 01:38:04,269
- Vesper...
- OK? Come on. Come on.

590
01:38:04,313 --> 01:38:05,705
You're staying with me.

591
01:38:06,576 --> 01:38:09,579
You're going to stay with me,
OK?

592
01:38:09,622 --> 01:38:13,148
You're going to stay with me.
You're not going to leave.

593
01:38:13,191 --> 01:38:14,714
No. No.

594
01:38:15,367 --> 01:38:17,500
- Please.
- Vesper.

595
01:38:17,543 --> 01:38:21,069
- Please don't leave me.
- Shh.

596
01:38:21,939 --> 01:38:23,680
- Please.
- Vesper.

597
01:38:24,507 --> 01:38:26,248
- Please.
- Vesper...

598
01:38:26,291 --> 01:38:27,640
Please.

599
01:38:30,861 --> 01:38:33,951
Please stay with me.

600
01:38:52,491 --> 01:38:54,885
Have beautiful dreams.
