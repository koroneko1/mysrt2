And what about
your little sister?

1133
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:56,960
She'd looked up to you.
She needed you, and now she's gone.

And you're going to abandon
her only child.

how to take care of a kid.

That is the whole point.

1141

You having a child means
being scared for them 24/7

and doing it anyway.
