1
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,648
(Police siren wails)

2
00:02:34,029 --> 00:02:36,198
- Hi, hon!
- Hey.

3
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:38,117
Thank you.

4
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,994
- This is it then.
- Hmm.

5
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:42,663
- Nervous?
- A bit.

6
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:43,956
You'll be all right.

7
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:46,166
First in every morning,
last out.

8
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,626
How are my panda eyes?

9
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:51,422
They're fine. Bad night?

10
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:55,384
Er, no, this is actually me
after a good night's sleep.

11
00:02:56,343 --> 00:03:00,806
I value each and every member
of my team

12
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,391
and I let head office know this.

13
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:05,603
But the new management have
pushed for a list of six of you

14
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,396
for the super team.

15
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:11,609
So, the names I've put forward
are Brodie...

16
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,152
- Jamie.
- (Man) Yes!

17
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:14,612
- Laura.
- (Woman) Brilliant!

18
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:16,238
- Andy.
- Right!

19
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:17,698
- Daniel.
- Yeah!

20
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:18,824
And, er...

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,911
- Kirsty.
- Oh.

22
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,787
So congratulations to those six.

23
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:25,831
Let's have a few minutes
to digest everything

24
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,291
and then back to work.

25
00:03:29,335 --> 00:03:31,045
I can't believe it.

26
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:33,172
- Not now.
- Yeah.

27
00:03:33,255 --> 00:03:34,798
- No.
- Yeah, now.

28
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:38,802
(Woman) Kirsty? She hasn't
been here five minutes!

29
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:41,889
(Manager) I think you're very
competent and valued, Philippa.

30
00:03:41,972 --> 00:03:44,183
But after careful consideration,
I have decided

31
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,560
that you are at the right level
for you.

32
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,729
Are you actually reading
from an hr manual?

33
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:50,439
No, no.

34
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,942
Look, we both know
you've had issues.

35
00:03:54,193 --> 00:03:57,863
Me isn't skiving. I suffer
from chronic fatigue, Tony.

36
00:03:57,947 --> 00:03:59,281
It's a real illness.

37
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,116
And yet have I ever missed
a deadline?

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,160
I thought it was time to give
the younger ones

39
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:04,244
a chance to shine.

40
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:06,789
Well, if you want people
who are good at being under 40,

41
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,124
I will admit
I am struggling there.

42
00:04:09,208 --> 00:04:11,335
But so are you.

43
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:13,963
Hair wax isn't fooling anyone.

44
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,756
It's Clay, actually.

45
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,517
I can't face it.

46
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,354
What would improve things
for you?

47
00:04:31,563 --> 00:04:33,565
A penis.

48
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:37,236
Well, you can have mine.
It's not very busy these days.

49
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:39,655
Trying to make me laugh
isn't helping much, John.

50
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:44,076
I just keep getting horrible
flashbacks to when I was ill.

51
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,704
Yeah, don't do anything
impetuous. That's all I ask.

52
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:50,457
We have two households to run
and we need your wages too.

53
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:51,917
(Philippa) Boys!

54
00:04:55,587 --> 00:04:57,589
Wait a minute,
are you not eating with us too?

55
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:01,218
No. I'm, er, going out
for dinner with a woman.

56
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,636
Tomato sauce and salad.

57
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,471
Yes, I met her
on plenty of fish.

58
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,140
No, I don't know much about her.

59
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,683
John, please,
can't you rearrange?

60
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:10,352
I can't face having to go
to this play tonight.

61
00:05:10,436 --> 00:05:12,271
Not on my own.
Boys, come on now!

62
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:14,356
Yes, I could,
but I'm not going to.

63
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,483
And one day,
you'll thank me for it.

64
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:20,529
Oh. You wearing that jacket,
are you?

65
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,156
Yes, I am.

66
00:05:24,408 --> 00:05:25,993
Good luck, biggles.

67
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:31,165
- My guy's going down.
- My blues are terrible.

68
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:33,834
- (Philippa) Boys!
- Deploy my troops!

69
00:05:34,501 --> 00:05:35,836
Dinner is served.

70
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:40,674
- Mum, what are you doing?
- Mum?

71
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:42,801
- What are you doing?
- You're not listening to me.

72
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,178
You're coming to the theatre.

73
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,763
You're going round
your grandma's.

74
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,390
Come on. Max, it's not me
that has to write that essay.

75
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:49,558
- Quicker.
- Crazy woman.

76
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,935
- Er, thank you! I wonder why.
- You're a crazy woman.

77
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,480
Don't copy your brother, raife.

78
00:05:55,397 --> 00:05:59,568
(Man) Now is the winter
of our discontent

79
00:05:59,651 --> 00:06:03,697
made glorious summer
by this son of York.

80
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:07,743
And all the clouds that
lour'd upon our house

81
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,038
in the deep bosom
of the ocean buried.

82
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:16,251
But I, that am rudely stamp'd,

83
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,129
and want love's majesty,

84
00:06:19,213 --> 00:06:23,092
I, that am curtail'd
of this fair proportion,

85
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:28,764
cheated of feature
by dissembling nature,

86
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,434
deformed, unfinish'd,

87
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,312
sent before my time
into this breathing world,

88
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,022
scarce half made up,

89
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:39,900
and that so lamely
and unfashionable

90
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:43,612
that dogs bark at me
as I halt by them,

91
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,990
why, I...

92
00:06:48,867 --> 00:06:52,830
In this weak piping time
of peace...

93
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:57,417
Have no delight
to pass away the time,

94
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:02,339
unless to spy my shadow
in the sun

95
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:05,551
and descant
on mine own deformity.

96
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:11,265
Therefore, since I cannot
prove a lover,

97
00:07:12,516 --> 00:07:15,978
I am determined
to prove a villain.

98
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,027
(Chatter)

99
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,905
Can we just stay here, please?

100
00:07:26,989 --> 00:07:29,533
Look, I know it's tough when
you start a new school, Max,

101
00:07:29,616 --> 00:07:31,451
but you've got to make
an effort, darling.

102
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,704
Just talk about the play, yeah?
Come on.

103
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:38,709
Hello. I'm Philippa, Max's mum.

104
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:40,169
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

105
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:41,920
- Alex, Lucy's father.
- How do you do?

106
00:07:42,004 --> 00:07:43,589
- Hey.
- And this is my wife, Susan.

107
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,673
- Hello.
- Hi.

108
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,636
- (Philippa) Hi.
- We were just trying to tot up

109
00:07:46,717 --> 00:07:48,635
how many more the wicked
bugger's got to murder

110
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,804
before he gets his sticky mitts
on the crown.

111
00:07:50,888 --> 00:07:52,431
I actually felt quite sorry
for him.

112
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,808
- Because of his hump?
- Oh, no.

113
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,352
It was, erm, all that stuff
about him feeling so ugly,

114
00:07:57,436 --> 00:07:59,646
he couldn't look at himself
in the mirror.

115
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,065
Still, it's not real, is it?
It's just a play.

116
00:08:02,149 --> 00:08:04,151
Yeah,
but it's a historical play.

117
00:08:04,234 --> 00:08:07,237
Shakespeare was writing about
what was to him recent history.

118
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,655
Well, I just don't believe

119
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:10,991
someone would be that wicked
because of a disability.

120
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,701
Doesn't ring true to me.

121
00:08:12,784 --> 00:08:15,412
And that's your critique
of Shakespeare, is it?

122
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,496
"Doesn't ring true"?

123
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,123
(Bell rings)

124
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,709
Well, see how you feel about him

125
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,419
after he murders
his two little nephews

126
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,630
in the second half. (Chuckles)

127
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:27,591
I wish the bastards dead

128
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:31,762
and I would have it
suddenly perform'd.

129
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:36,308
What sayest thou?
Speak suddenly, be brief.

130
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,810
Your grace may do your pleasure.

131
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:39,895
(Richard) Hmm.

132
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:43,148
(Buckingham) Be happy then,
for it is done, my lord.

133
00:08:43,232 --> 00:08:45,150
(Snores)

134
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:51,031
I think there be six richmonds
in the field.

135
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:54,034
Five have I slain today
instead of him.

136
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:55,869
(Swords unsheathe)

137
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,580
A horse! A horse!

138
00:08:58,664 --> 00:09:00,832
My kingdom for a horse!

139
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,876
(Groans)

140
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,849
God and your arms be praised,
victorious friends.

141
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,227
The day is ours.

142
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,021
The bloody dog is dead.

143
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,358
(Car horn)

144
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,528
(Susan) Sorry. Excuse us.
Come on, Lucy!

145
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,824
Mum, what are you doing? Mum!

146
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:38,954
Hello, Philippa.

147
00:09:39,037 --> 00:09:42,291
Richard III died in 1485.

148
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,545
Shakespeare didn't write
his play until around 1593.

149
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,463
Sorry, I'm not following you.

150
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,091
You said Shakespeare was
writing about recent history.

151
00:09:51,174 --> 00:09:53,468
He wasn't. He wrote it
over a hundred years

152
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:55,345
after Richard's death.

153
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:57,306
All right.

154
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,890
And they reckon
he probably made it up

155
00:09:58,974 --> 00:10:00,309
that he was a hunchback.

156
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,978
But it's just a play, isn't it?

157
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,105
That's what I said.

158
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:10,110
Ok. Bye.

159
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,824
Max, come on.

160
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,077
I just don't like it

161
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:21,413
when people put others
down for no reason.

162
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:25,292
So, your dad's got
a new girlfriend then?

163
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,502
(Max) Her name's Sarah
and she likes seafood,

164
00:10:27,586 --> 00:10:29,463
so dad's taking her
to a fish restaurant.

165
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:31,423
(Philippa) He'll have the steak.

166
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,309
If it's a call,
introduce yourself.

167
00:10:42,392 --> 00:10:44,728
If it's a man,
I talk about the footy.

168
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,647
But throughout all
your conversations, remember,

169
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,400
put on a happy face, and smile.

170
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:52,069
It's on the phone, Tony.

171
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,573
Well, your voice
can still have a smile in it.

172
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,492
"Hello. And how are you today?"

173
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,660
Thank you, Kirsty. Yes.

174
00:11:00,744 --> 00:11:03,622
You don't have to see a smile
to know that it's there.

175
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,500
Very important.
Please, continue.

176
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,920
(Kirsty) If it's a new client,
say something to disarm them.

177
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,255
"Sorry, I've been
a bit hectic today."

178
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,299
Or if it's towards
the end of the week,

179
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:17,010
tell them about how much
you're looking forward to...

180
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,762
(Voice fades)

181
00:11:29,523 --> 00:11:30,524
(Gasps)

182
00:11:46,289 --> 00:11:48,708
(Kirsty)
If they're an existing client,

183
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:52,421
do make sure that you
offer them new opportunities

184
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:55,048
or alternative campaign
strategies.

185
00:11:55,132 --> 00:11:57,467
(Tony) That's good, but you
don't want to get trapped.

186
00:11:57,551 --> 00:11:59,886
So, what you need is an...

187
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:03,557
Exit strategy.

188
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,328
(Sighs)

189
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,830
(Gasps)

190
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:55,358
(Engine runs)

191
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,360
- Come on. Quick, quick, quick.
- Morning, boys.

192
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,446
- Quick, quick, quicker.
- Quick as you like.

193
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:00,864
- Gym bag.
- (Max) Thank you.

194
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:03,116
Ok, mind your head.

195
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,535
Don't let the bastards
grind you down.

196
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:06,620
- Thanks.
- Bye, mum.

197
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:07,954
- Bye, mum.
- Bye.

198
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,531
Hi, erm, do you have any books
on Richard III?

199
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,575
- The king?
- I know who you mean.

200
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:50,247
Historical books,
not Shakespeare, please.

201
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:52,415
(Keyboard clicks)

202
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:54,918
We have eight titles.

203
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,796
Yes, please. I'll take them.

204
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:59,297
Which ones?

205
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,592
All of them.

206
00:14:31,121 --> 00:14:32,581
(Man) Thank you.

207
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,220
(Philippa) Look, I...

208
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,182
I know you're some sort
of apparition, so...

209
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,478
You can just go away
and leave me alone.

210
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,979
Please.

211
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,109
This is private property.

212
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,291
(Philippa)
What is it you're going to see?

213
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,211
- Skyfall. James Bond.
- Oh.

214
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,545
- Mum?
- Yes, darling?

215
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,673
Can you actually get
a licence to kill?

216
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,091
Max says you can.

217
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,593
You just get a form from the
post office and apply for it.

218
00:16:08,677 --> 00:16:10,717
- Like a driving licence.
- You can't, can you, mum?

219
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,722
- No, he's being daft.
- They only cost 15 quid.

220
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:13,807
Max!

221
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,475
(John)
You sure you don't wanna come?

222
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:17,310
No. I'm gonna put my feet up.

223
00:16:18,353 --> 00:16:19,479
Enjoy the film.

224
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,023
- See you later.
- Bye, mum.

225
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,566
Bye, boys.

226
00:17:00,478 --> 00:17:04,107
(Woman) They love to paint him
as some kind of monster,

227
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,568
devoid of compassion and pity.

228
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:10,321
But I read
a contemporary article

229
00:17:10,405 --> 00:17:12,407
from the croyland chronicle
the other day...

230
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:13,783
Ah, the croyland.

231
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:17,287
That noted
and oft-quoted medieval organ.

232
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:21,207
(Woman) ...About when
king Richard lost his only son.

233
00:17:23,376 --> 00:17:26,296
"On hearing the news
of his death at Nottingham,

234
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,173
where they were then residing,

235
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:30,842
you might have seen
his father and mother

236
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:34,179
in a state almost bordering
on madness

237
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:36,848
"by reason
of their sudden grief."

238
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,268
And then, a few months later,

239
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,687
his own wife dies
of tuberculosis.

240
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:45,940
Poor man.
Must've been heartbroken.

241
00:17:46,024 --> 00:17:48,234
Doesn't sound much like
Shakespeare's villain.

242
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:51,112
Thank you. And this is just
the circumstantial stuff.

243
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:53,239
We have facts.
We have hard evidence

244
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:54,616
to refute every accusation

245
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,618
that Richard's detractors
would put to us.

246
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:57,952
If we ever get the opportunity.

247
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,871
Exactly! But we're shouting
into the void

248
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,248
- and nobody's listening.
- (Man) Oh, shut up.

249
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:03,666
Thank you.

250
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:08,379
Because Shakespeare's play is
more attractive than the truth.

251
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,423
I'm sorry, my name's Philippa.

252
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,425
You must be
the Richard III society.

253
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:13,551
(Man) Correct!

254
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:16,679
Brackets, Edinburgh branch,
close brackets.

255
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,808
At your... disposal.

256
00:18:19,891 --> 00:18:21,226
(Chuckles)

257
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,938
(Dramatic music, gunfire)

258
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:28,149
(Helicopter rotors whir)

259
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,032
There's so many people who seem
to take such a dim view of him.

260
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,659
They do indeed.

261
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,536
Well, they can't all be wrong,
can they?

262
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,913
(Man) Have you ever heard
gossip about yourself

263
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:44,165
and thought, "how can they
say that about me

264
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,708
when they don't even know me?"

265
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,002
(Woman) Most of what is written
about king Richard

266
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,796
is based on tudor history

267
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:53,716
because Henry vii
won the battle of bosworth.

268
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,885
(Man) If you get in quick
with the first lie,

269
00:18:55,969 --> 00:18:58,471
and repeat it often enough,
then it becomes the truth.

270
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:00,640
And Richard wasn't around
to defend himself, was he?

271
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,227
I'd like to join your society.

272
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,980
Oh, hail fellow well met!

273
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,898
You must commune
with us, Philippa.

274
00:19:08,982 --> 00:19:12,735
I'm about to procure a round of
hook Norton's old hooky ales.

275
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,072
Oh, thanks. I'll just
have a ginger beer, please.

276
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,367
(Man) "If you can bear
to hear the truth you've spoken"

277
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:23,413
twisted by knaves
to make a trap for fools,

278
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:27,333
or watch the things
you gave your life to, broken,

279
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:30,628
and stoop and build them up

280
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:32,630
"with worn-out tools."

281
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:38,803
I'll get the drinks in.

282
00:19:39,929 --> 00:19:41,848
Six pints of old hooky ale,

283
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,808
and a ginger beer, please.

284
00:19:43,892 --> 00:19:47,520
He's very eloquent.
Does he work in a theatre?

285
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:49,272
No. Car phone warehouse.

286
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,858
Just till he gets back
on his feet again.

287
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,611
You sure you want to join
this group?

288
00:19:54,694 --> 00:19:57,447
You look quite normal.

289
00:19:59,574 --> 00:20:00,992
I'm not.

290
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:06,331
So, why are you all interested
in Richard III?

291
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:08,333
Everyone has their own reasons,
I suppose.

292
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,544
But the one thing
that binds us ricardians

293
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:15,131
is that we stand united
against lies and falsehoods,

294
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,551
whether they be peddled
on tudor printing presses

295
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,844
or on Twitter.

296
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:24,724
- What about you?
- Oh. Not quite sure.

297
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:28,353
I'd quite like to pay
my respects, though.

298
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,396
You know, maybe
visit his grave one day.

299
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,274
Oh, you'll have a job.
There isn't one.

300
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:35,360
Depending on who you talk to,

301
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,570
he was either thrown
into the river soar

302
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:40,531
or his mortal remains
are lost to history.

303
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:51,084
(Engine revs)

304
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:06,474
- (Max) Hi, mum.
- Hey. How was it?

305
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:08,017
- (Max) Really good.
- Yeah?

306
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:10,645
- (Max) M dies at the end.
- Oh, great.

307
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:12,730
- Forty people were killed.
- (Philippa) Yeah?

308
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:14,148
But James Bond only killed

309
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,150
- 17 people.
- Right.

310
00:21:16,234 --> 00:21:20,780
Which means 23 of them were
killed by unlicensed people.

311
00:21:20,863 --> 00:21:23,866
Oh. Oh, dear.
Er, don't get too comfortable.

312
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:27,161
It's a school night. Remember?
Go on, I'll be up in a minute.

313
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:28,329
Goodnight.

314
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,708
- Night, Max.
- (Max) Goodnight.

315
00:21:33,084 --> 00:21:34,127
Did you manage to relax?

316
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:36,713
Yeah, it was nice and quiet,
really.

317
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,924
You went out?

318
00:21:40,008 --> 00:21:42,468
Yeah, just to the corner shop.

319
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,637
For... tomatoes.

320
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:48,307
Right. I'm away home.

321
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:49,809
- (Philippa) Goodnight.
- Night.

322
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,131
Mum, you look like a panda.

323
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,341
Oh, thanks, darling.

324
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,635
Don't go to work today, mum.

325
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,345
Stay at home
until you feel better.

326
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,723
Thanks, sweetheart.
Think I will.

327
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,349
Look after your brother,
all right?

328
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:57,251
(Philippa) I have a condition...

329
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:02,006
Which I have to manage.

330
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:08,387
It's called me and, erm...

331
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:12,058
It flares up when I'm stressed.

332
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,689
It's funny, people find out
this one thing about you

333
00:23:18,773 --> 00:23:20,525
and that's all they can see.

334
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,657
But there's more to me
than that.

335
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,960
I've been trying to work out
why you're here.

336
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:42,505
I'm wondering
if it's because you're lost.

337
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,471
- (Philippa) Hi.
- (Both) Hi.

338
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:54,183
We think you might be having
some sort of breakdown.

339
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,853
We think
you need to talk to someone.

340
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,814
Sorry, is this some
kind of intervention?

341
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:02,066
No. You haven't answered
our calls,

342
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,610
you haven't answered our texts.
What have you been doing?

343
00:24:04,694 --> 00:24:06,821
And you should know
Tony's saying that you left

344
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,281
because of your health.

345
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:11,284
He says he's been covering up
the extent of your me for years.

346
00:24:11,367 --> 00:24:13,578
How can he say that?
It's not even true.

347
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:16,372
But you're not there to defend
yourself though, are you?

348
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:22,837
Do you know the principle
"innocent until proven guilty"

349
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,423
was introduced 500 years ago?

350
00:24:25,506 --> 00:24:27,425
By Richard III, actually.

351
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:29,594
(Woman) No.

352
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:33,389
No, neither did I
until about two days ago.

353
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,932
Excuse me.

354
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:36,517
Where are you going?

355
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:41,063
- Not back to work.
- What'll you do, Phil?

356
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:44,609
I don't know. Maybe,
erm... have an adventure?

357
00:24:56,746 --> 00:24:58,289
(Philippa) Jessica,
nice to meet you.

358
00:24:58,372 --> 00:24:59,790
Pleased to meet you too,
Philippa.

359
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:01,792
Welcome
to the king Richard family.

360
00:25:01,876 --> 00:25:05,796
You wrote to me about
greyfriars church and the king?

361
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,883
Yes, nobody now knows
where the church is located,

362
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:11,510
but you believe that's where
they buried Richard

363
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:12,887
after the battle of bosworth?

364
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:15,473
All the sources suggest
he could have been.

365
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,017
My guess is
he'd be under the choir.

366
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,894
It's the part of the church
where they buried

367
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:22,188
- all the important people.
- Ah, ok.

368
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,523
Er, but, you know,
you really should have a word

369
00:25:24,607 --> 00:25:25,650
with Graham naismith.

370
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:27,693
He's an amateur historian
I came across.

371
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:28,986
Lives over there in cornwall.

372
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,865
- (Raife) Mum!
- Yes, in here. Hey, love.

373
00:25:32,949 --> 00:25:34,408
Did you stay at home all day?

374
00:25:34,492 --> 00:25:36,077
No, I wasn't feeling very well.

375
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,621
- I'm feeling much better now.
- (Raife) What's for dinner?

376
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,415
Erm, I don't know. I haven't...
I'll do it in a minute.

377
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,168
Can we just order some pizza?
Max knows how to do it.

378
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:46,879
Yes, ok.
Take my card, it's just there.

379
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:51,342
Don't tell your dad, ok?
Where is he, by the way?

380
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:53,052
Entertaining his female suitor.

381
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:54,887
Ah, makes sense.

382
00:25:54,971 --> 00:25:58,015
I was talking to Jessica
in San Diego and she said

383
00:25:58,099 --> 00:26:00,268
you were the man to speak to
about Richard's grave.

384
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:02,770
Ah, the holy grail.

385
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,939
Well, if you're interested
in all that,

386
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,357
I can send you a link
if you like.

387
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,110
Oh, Graham, that'd be...
That'd be fantastic, thank you.

388
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:12,822
The key is to find
Robert herrick's garden.

389
00:26:12,905 --> 00:26:14,865
- Whose?
- Robert herrick.

390
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,575
He was a former
mayor of Leicester

391
00:26:16,659 --> 00:26:19,495
who supposedly built a shrine
in the grounds of his mansion

392
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:23,582
in the early 1600s to Mark the
spot where Richard was buried.

393
00:26:24,458 --> 00:26:27,336
Sorry, Graham, I can't help
noticing your hair.

394
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:31,966
It looks a lot
like Richard III's.

395
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,634
Is that deliberate?

396
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,053
Yes.

397
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,974
Robert herrick was mayor
of Leicester in 1593

398
00:26:40,057 --> 00:26:42,351
and I think again in 1605.

399
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,979
There's a map somewhere
in the city archives

400
00:26:45,062 --> 00:26:47,023
which shows
where he built his mansion

401
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:48,607
and the layout of the grounds.

402
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,777
Graham this is all so useful.
Thank you.

403
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,865
I really like your hair
like that, by the way.

404
00:26:56,699 --> 00:27:00,119
It's like I've been sitting here
talking to Richard himself.

405
00:27:26,228 --> 00:27:29,023
"Naked of all clothing
and laid upon horseback

406
00:27:29,106 --> 00:27:32,068
with the arms and legs
hanging down on both sides,

407
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,695
the body of king Richard
was brought

408
00:27:34,779 --> 00:27:37,490
"to the Abbey of
monks franciscans at Leicester."

409
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,159
"A miserable spectacle."

410
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:06,685
- Did the boys get off ok?
- (John) Er, yeah, fine, fine.

411
00:28:06,769 --> 00:28:08,938
You know, I've got
a good feeling about today.

412
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,439
Do you?

413
00:28:10,523 --> 00:28:12,858
Well, I mean, if Tony's
sending you on this course

414
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,903
then he obviously
still thinks highly of you.

415
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:18,239
Yeah, no, I wouldn't get
too excited, it's just...

416
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:20,199
And you'll be back by 7:30?

417
00:28:20,282 --> 00:28:22,410
I've got to be away by then,
7:45 the latest.

418
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:25,079
Yeah, I know. Don't wanna keep
seafood Sarah waiting, do we?

419
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:26,789
Pardon?

420
00:28:26,872 --> 00:28:28,457
Ok, bye.

421
00:28:30,334 --> 00:28:31,877
As you've probably worked out,

422
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:35,673
I'm not going on
a work training day thing.

423
00:28:37,091 --> 00:28:39,969
Going to Leicester,
for a lecture.

424
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,304
About you, actually.

425
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:45,391
In fact, today's all about you.

426
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:51,689
You're quite young, aren't you?
Thirty-two.

427
00:28:51,772 --> 00:28:54,859
Same age as Alexander the great
when he died.

428
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,570
I'm...

429
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:00,448
Forty-five.

430
00:29:02,283 --> 00:29:04,702
I've been told I could
easily pass for 37.

431
00:29:06,704 --> 00:29:09,290
Well, some days, I feel like 97.

432
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:14,670
I was reading that you were an
advocate for the printing press

433
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:18,507
at a time when it was considered
the work of the devil.

434
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:19,967
And those same machines

435
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:21,927
were used to print lies
about you.

436
00:29:23,846 --> 00:29:25,639
Five hundred years of lies.

437
00:29:37,902 --> 00:29:39,904
Upon Edward iv's death,

438
00:29:39,987 --> 00:29:43,657
Richard put the king's
young sons, his own nephews,

439
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:45,075
in the tower of London.

440
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:47,453
Then he made his move.

441
00:29:47,536 --> 00:29:49,788
First he put it about that
these boys were illegitimate.

442
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:51,665
Then on June the 26th,

443
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:55,294
he declared himself
king Richard III.

444
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:57,963
The classic coup d'etat.

445
00:29:58,047 --> 00:30:00,090
And of course,
the princes in the tower

446
00:30:00,174 --> 00:30:01,800
were never seen
or heard of again.

447
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,886
- Er...
- Oh. Yes?

448
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:07,848
Sorry, but his nephews
were illegitimate.

449
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:12,019
Edward iv had already
married lady Eleanor Butler,

450
00:30:12,102 --> 00:30:14,146
so his marriage
to the princes' mother,

451
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:16,482
Elizabeth woodville,
was unlawful.

452
00:30:16,565 --> 00:30:18,734
Those boys would never
have been crowned.

453
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,237
They were born out
of an illegal marriage.

454
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,697
Madam, on the royal
family's own website,

455
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:27,117
you will find Richard
listed there as a usurper.

456
00:30:27,201 --> 00:30:29,036
Then people
are being misinformed.

457
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,163
There's actually
no contemporary evidence

458
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:32,873
to say he murdered the princes.

459
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:35,084
Tyrrell's admission
that he killed the boys

460
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:36,418
on Richard's orders?

461
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,713
Or the writings of
the Italian courtier Mancini.

462
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,882
Unsupported tudor propaganda.

463
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:45,553
And wilful misrepresentation
of Mancini.

464
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,054
Respectively.

465
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:51,600
I strongly feel that
he's innocent of their murders.

466
00:30:51,684 --> 00:30:55,354
Oh, you "feel" strongly.
You have a feeling.

467
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,064
A hunch, perhaps?

468
00:30:57,147 --> 00:30:59,358
Like Richard?

469
00:30:59,441 --> 00:31:01,110
(Laughter)

470
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:03,237
Actually, no one who met him
when he was alive

471
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,697
said he had a hunchback.

472
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,991
(Lecturer) The opinions
of the greatest historians

473
00:31:07,074 --> 00:31:10,327
of the modern age are
in almost unanimous agreement

474
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:12,788
that Richard III, who of course
met his ignominious end

475
00:31:12,871 --> 00:31:15,040
not ten miles away
from where we now sit,

476
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:19,044
was a usurper
and, all things considered,

477
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:21,589
a pretty unsavoury individual.

478
00:31:21,672 --> 00:31:23,924
The evidence is that...
That he brought the country

479
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:26,927
the strong leadership it needed
after the death of his brother

480
00:31:27,011 --> 00:31:29,430
and went on to create
a fairer and more just society.

481
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:32,141
Perhaps you might tell us
your name?

482
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,643
Erm...

483
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,731
Philippa... Langley.

484
00:31:38,814 --> 00:31:39,898
And you're from?

485
00:31:41,317 --> 00:31:42,943
The Richard III society.

486
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,403
Oh, the fan club.

487
00:31:44,486 --> 00:31:47,197
Well, thank you,
Philippa Langley.

488
00:31:47,281 --> 00:31:49,783
But you might like to know
that the study of history

489
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:51,368
is an academic discipline

490
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:54,788
based upon rigorous
and dispassionate research

491
00:31:54,872 --> 00:31:58,208
so that one might
take the evidence and study it

492
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:01,420
and then draw conclusions,
rather than the other way round.

493
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:06,383
Now, that's not a feeling,
that's a fact. Hmm.

494
00:32:11,472 --> 00:32:13,932
Dr ashdown-hill.
I've read your book.

495
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,143
I was wondering
if you'd sign my copy, please.

496
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,896
Of course!
Well done, by the way, dear.

497
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:20,814
You stood your ground.

498
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:23,484
You pay no attention to him,
pompous old queen.

499
00:32:23,567 --> 00:32:25,152
- There you go.
- (Woman) Thank you.

500
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:28,113
There's a woman in her 60s
living in Canada,

501
00:32:28,197 --> 00:32:30,157
and a cabinet maker in clapham

502
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,284
who've got more claim
to the throne than Henry vii.

503
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:34,953
- Or any of the other tudors.
- Pardon?

504
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,705
I've just spent
the last 18 months

505
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:39,416
tracing the mitochondrial DNA
of Richard's sister

506
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,710
all the way down to
their present-day descendants.

507
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,504
I'm about to publish
the results.

508
00:32:43,587 --> 00:32:44,797
That's amazing!

509
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:48,008
Er, actually, I was wondering
if I could ask you something.

510
00:32:48,092 --> 00:32:49,218
We'll have to walk and talk.

511
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:50,636
- Of course.
- I'm already late.

512
00:32:51,303 --> 00:32:54,014
(Philippa) What I wanted to say
is that you've so inspired me,

513
00:32:54,098 --> 00:32:55,974
I want to try and find
greyfriars church.

514
00:32:56,058 --> 00:32:57,893
(Ash down-hill)
Oh, that's long since gone.

515
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,520
No, that disappeared
centuries ago.

516
00:32:59,603 --> 00:33:00,979
(Philippa) Right. Well, we know

517
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:02,564
it had to be on
a main thoroughfare

518
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:06,110
so the friars could beg alms
from passers-by, right?

519
00:33:06,193 --> 00:33:08,612
And that's to the south
of st Martin's church.

520
00:33:08,696 --> 00:33:10,698
Now the cathedral,
which is to the east

521
00:33:10,781 --> 00:33:12,866
- of the old city wall...
- Taxi!

522
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:14,952
Yes, that's very impressive.

523
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,787
I know
what you're really looking for,

524
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,831
and, er, it's not an old church.

525
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:19,915
Oh?

526
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,417
Well, I wish you
the best of luck.

527
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,836
Plenty have tried to find him
and failed.

528
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,254
Gateway house, please.

529
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:27,423
Well, er, do you have
any advice?

530
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,469
There's a good chance Richard
is under a shopping centre,

531
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:35,681
forever entombed in a concrete
pile beneath top shop.

532
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:36,765
(Philippa) Right.

533
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,767
But when the dissolution
occurred,

534
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:40,477
the friaries and monasteries

535
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:42,479
were still regarded
as sacred places.

536
00:33:42,563 --> 00:33:45,232
People are very superstitious
about things like that.

537
00:33:45,315 --> 00:33:47,067
So, although
they may have rebuilt

538
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:48,485
the surrounding buildings,

539
00:33:48,569 --> 00:33:50,696
the site of a church
like greyfriars, for instance,

540
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:52,281
was often left undisturbed.

541
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:55,284
So what are you saying?

542
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,078
Look for an open space.

543
00:33:58,162 --> 00:34:01,081
Ok. Thank you. All right.

544
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,770
"From this spot were scattered
into the river soar

545
00:35:04,853 --> 00:35:06,605
the remains of Richard III."

546
00:35:23,831 --> 00:35:25,999
(Horn blares)

547
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,940
What was that? On the bridge?

548
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:52,693
- I thought it'd be funny.
- Well, it wasn't.

549
00:35:54,862 --> 00:35:56,488
Sorry, did you just talk?

550
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,991
How come
you've never spoken before?

551
00:35:59,074 --> 00:36:00,993
You've never asked me anything
before.

552
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:02,160
Right.

553
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,622
Wait, you don't happen to know
where you are, do you?

554
00:36:05,706 --> 00:36:07,124
- Might help.
- Watch out.

555
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:09,793
- (Car horn beeps)
- You were dead. Sorry.

556
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,482
(Bird wings flutter)

557
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,543
(Breathes heavily)

558
00:37:34,962 --> 00:37:37,547
- (Man) Are you lost?
- Sorry?

559
00:37:38,924 --> 00:37:40,008
Erm...

560
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,179
Excuse me, could you, erm...

561
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:49,810
Could you tell me what
that letter represents, please?

562
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:52,270
Just means reserved.

563
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:54,398
It's the social services
car park.

564
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:56,274
That bay's reserved
for one of the managers.

565
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:58,193
Of course. Reserved.

566
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:01,154
Thanks.

567
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,582
Oh.

568
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:14,418
Oh, shit. Shit.

569
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:17,921
Thanks.

570
00:38:19,673 --> 00:38:21,008
Shit, shit.

571
00:38:21,091 --> 00:38:23,802
- (Whistle blows)
- Oh, fuck. Sorry.

572
00:38:23,885 --> 00:38:27,305
No! No! No, no, no!

573
00:38:27,389 --> 00:38:28,765
Oh, no!

574
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:37,774
I'm so sorry.

575
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,903
Glass?

576
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:43,280
I'd better not.

577
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:47,701
No, don't want to be ill for,
er, work tomorrow, do we?

578
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,749
Was Sarah ok?

579
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,878
Sarah's fine. Sarah's normal.

580
00:39:03,216 --> 00:39:04,426
Tony rang.

581
00:39:04,509 --> 00:39:06,970
I know you haven't been
in work for the last two weeks.

582
00:39:07,763 --> 00:39:10,599
I'm not actually that bothered
that you lied to me

583
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:15,437
or selfishly ruined my evening,
but what about the boys?

584
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,856
I told you we can't afford
for you to be out of work.

585
00:39:17,939 --> 00:39:19,399
I know, I know.

586
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:28,658
It's none of my business,
but were you with someone today?

587
00:39:31,453 --> 00:39:32,746
No, absolutely not.

588
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:35,624
Sorry, what do you mean, John?

589
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:40,253
Well, I... you're clearly
hiding something from me.

590
00:39:40,337 --> 00:39:42,339
I mean, where were you today?

591
00:39:42,422 --> 00:39:44,800
- Erm, Leicester.
- Leicester?

592
00:39:44,883 --> 00:39:48,470
Look, I've had an idea.

593
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:50,013
Now, just listen.

594
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:54,518
It's not as mad as it's...
Probably going to sound,

595
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:58,021
but, erm, well, I've been
doing a lot of research.

596
00:39:58,105 --> 00:40:00,232
All the information
I need to find him,

597
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,400
well, it's all out there
but it's in...

598
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:05,112
Lots of different little pieces
scattered all over the place

599
00:40:05,195 --> 00:40:08,740
and I... I don't think anybody's
brought it all together before,

600
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:09,991
but I...

601
00:40:12,994 --> 00:40:14,538
I know I can find him.

602
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,165
Who?

603
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,793
Richard.

604
00:40:19,876 --> 00:40:21,336
Richard who?

605
00:40:22,254 --> 00:40:24,714
Sorry, the third.

606
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,174
The king?

607
00:40:26,258 --> 00:40:29,136
(Philippa) If I can find him,
I can give him a voice.

608
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,139
I think you need help.

609
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:33,557
John, if you...

610
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:36,393
If you could just understand
the way it's made me feel.

611
00:40:37,727 --> 00:40:40,397
You know, when I'm in the middle
of my research,

612
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:43,024
when I'm thinking about
what I can do for him, I...

613
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:48,196
I feel energised.

614
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,614
I feel happy.

615
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:52,117
- Do you?
- Yes.

616
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,578
And this, is that why
you wanted me to leave?

617
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,872
Because I didn't make you
feel energised or happy?

618
00:40:56,955 --> 00:40:59,541
- You walked out, John.
- It was constructive dismissal.

619
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,168
(Sighs)

620
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,838
Always looking for something,

621
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:07,174
isn't that what you
always used to say about me?

622
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:09,968
Well... well, now I actually am.

623
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:15,182
Richard III. (Chuckles)

624
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,810
I remember there was a picture
in the textbook at school

625
00:41:18,894 --> 00:41:22,480
of Richard,
and he creeped me out.

626
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:25,025
It's the evil hunchback that
killed the princes in the tower.

627
00:41:25,108 --> 00:41:28,195
Yes, but he didn't kill
his nephews and he wasn't evil.

628
00:41:29,070 --> 00:41:31,531
I don't believe
he even had a hunchback.

629
00:41:31,615 --> 00:41:35,035
That's all stuff the tudors put
about to trash his reputation.

630
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:38,705
He was a good man.
I'm convinced of it.

631
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:40,290
But nobody's interested.

632
00:41:41,791 --> 00:41:44,211
If I can find him,
then they would be.

633
00:41:46,004 --> 00:41:47,714
What are you talking about?

634
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:50,675
Ok, imagine this.
You're Henry vii.

635
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:54,262
You're... you're the new king
and you need everyone

636
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:56,973
to hate the king
that came before you, Richard.

637
00:41:57,057 --> 00:42:00,393
So you'd think that in your
first speech to the country,

638
00:42:00,477 --> 00:42:03,521
which was recorded
in the parliamentary archives,

639
00:42:03,605 --> 00:42:06,107
that you might mention
the fact that he'd killed

640
00:42:06,191 --> 00:42:08,693
those two little princes,
wouldn't you?

641
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:10,612
But he doesn't.

642
00:42:10,695 --> 00:42:12,739
You're starting to
sound slightly mad.

643
00:42:12,822 --> 00:42:15,283
He doesn't mention them. Why?

644
00:42:15,367 --> 00:42:17,535
Because they must've
still been alive.

645
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,748
(Sighs)

646
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,710
You know, I...
I think you might be right.

647
00:42:26,795 --> 00:42:29,839
If he didn't kill them
and he wasn't a hunchback...

648
00:42:32,342 --> 00:42:35,011
Oh, my god, I think I've got it.

649
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:38,598
Of course, the hump.

650
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:43,687
He must've stuffed the princes
up the back of his jumper!

651
00:42:44,521 --> 00:42:46,189
There, you've cracked it!

652
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:52,654
(Door opens)

653
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:55,240
(Door slams)

654
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:19,973
Hello?
Yes, I'd like to speak to, erm,

655
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,225
Richard Buckley, please.
Archaeological services.

656
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,185
(Teacher) Stay wide.
Keep your shape.

657
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,604
Support the scrum half.

658
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:29,524
I just thought as a Leicester
company, you might be

659
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:32,027
interested in sponsoring
the search for a king.

660
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,280
Hello, er, this is a message
from Philippa Langley

661
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,282
for Richard Buckley.

662
00:43:37,365 --> 00:43:39,409
Think there's a dig that
he might be interested in.

663
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,203
My phone number is 07...
Oh, my god!

664
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,122
- Did you see that?
- (Teacher) He's fine.

665
00:43:44,205 --> 00:43:46,291
Oh, my god, darling, are you ok?

666
00:43:46,541 --> 00:43:48,501
(Richard) Please don't take
this the wrong way.

667
00:43:48,585 --> 00:43:49,794
No.

668
00:43:49,878 --> 00:43:52,881
But even from my perspective,

669
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:57,510
this is starting to look a bit
like an unhealthy obsession?

670
00:43:57,594 --> 00:44:00,013
I can't believe
you just said that.

671
00:44:00,096 --> 00:44:02,557
I'm doing this for you.

672
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,851
Do you know what people
say about you?

673
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,188
I'm sure it's not
particularly flattering.

674
00:44:08,271 --> 00:44:11,024
Do you know
who William Shakespeare is?

675
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,611
Ok, well, he was
a very celebrated writer,

676
00:44:14,694 --> 00:44:18,448
and everyone thinks he's amazing
and he wrote a play about you.

677
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:20,617
And there's this bit
where you're supposedly

678
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,952
- talking about yourself.
- Go on.

679
00:44:23,036 --> 00:44:25,080
"So lame and unfashionable

680
00:44:25,163 --> 00:44:27,457
that dogs bark at me
as I halt by them."

681
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,836
You're so weird,
that you even freak out dogs.

682
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,255
That's a bit harsh.

683
00:44:34,339 --> 00:44:36,424
(Laptop chimes)

684
00:44:36,508 --> 00:44:37,842
Thank you for your enquiry,

685
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:39,761
but this is not something
we wish to pursue.

686
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,888
Unfortunately,
we are unable to assist you.

687
00:44:41,971 --> 00:44:44,224
This is not
the sort of project...

688
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:46,184
Is this a joke?
It's getting rather annoying.

689
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,061
- The answer is no.
- Sadly, no.

690
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,147
Unfortunately, your application
has been rejected.

691
00:44:51,231 --> 00:44:54,150
Your enquiry
was not appropriate.

692
00:44:54,234 --> 00:44:55,485
The answer is no.

693
00:44:59,322 --> 00:45:02,033
As you all know,
I've been doing some research

694
00:45:02,117 --> 00:45:04,494
into finding
king Richard's grave,

695
00:45:04,577 --> 00:45:07,205
with the intention of
giving him a proper burial

696
00:45:07,288 --> 00:45:09,165
with a royal coat of arms
on his tomb

697
00:45:09,249 --> 00:45:12,377
and restoring him to
his rightful place in history.

698
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,212
And a "hey, nonny nonny" to you.

699
00:45:14,295 --> 00:45:16,506
Well, for personal reasons,

700
00:45:16,589 --> 00:45:20,593
I'm going to have to suspend
my research indefinitely...

701
00:45:20,677 --> 00:45:22,929
This is a travesty!
You can't stop now!

702
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:25,682
- I won't allow it!
- Keith!

703
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:27,308
If you don't mind me saying,

704
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:31,646
perhaps the kindest thing
is to set the girl free.

705
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,897
Many a ricardian,

706
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:35,442
and I'm certainly not looking
at you, you personally,

707
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:40,405
has wandered down that same path
only to discover little more

708
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,908
than the calcified remains
of his own ambition.

709
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:48,288
What's happened, Philippa?

710
00:45:49,914 --> 00:45:51,541
I've been trying
to generate interest

711
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:53,751
from possible sponsors,
but I haven't had any luck,

712
00:45:53,835 --> 00:45:58,298
and I can't get through to
a guy called Richard Buckley,

713
00:45:58,381 --> 00:45:59,632
a Leicester archaeologist.

714
00:45:59,716 --> 00:46:01,718
Philippa,
I used to live next door

715
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:03,553
to the lord mayor of Leicester.

716
00:46:04,888 --> 00:46:07,932
The current lord mayor.
We used to be neighbours.

717
00:46:09,434 --> 00:46:11,269
Well, anyway, my mind's
made up on this.

718
00:46:11,352 --> 00:46:13,605
I could ask him if he'd help.

719
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:23,156
Dad, how heavy is 330 pounds?

720
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:25,450
(Max) Hello! Is anyone in there?

721
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,452
About two of me.

722
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,245
And that's how heavy
the Cannon balls are.

723
00:46:29,329 --> 00:46:32,290
And they could fire them
two miles!

724
00:46:32,373 --> 00:46:34,667
(John) Imagine one of those
landing on your foot.

725
00:46:35,919 --> 00:46:37,670
- (Philippa) Hey.
- (Raife) Hi, mum.

726
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,464
- (John) Hi.
- (Philippa) Hey.

727
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:41,591
- (John) Found him yet?
- Very funny.

728
00:46:44,177 --> 00:46:45,887
So, how are you?

729
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:48,932
Psoriasis is back on my elbows.

730
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:50,266
Work's a bit shit,

731
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:53,520
but just trying to make the best
of it, like everyone else.

732
00:46:54,646 --> 00:46:56,814
Well, almost everyone else.

733
00:46:58,650 --> 00:47:00,902
I spoke to awusi, from work.

734
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:02,987
Hmm! And what did she
have to say?

735
00:47:03,071 --> 00:47:06,616
I should know my place?
Start baking cakes?

736
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,326
People do like cake.

737
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:10,495
Hmm.

738
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,083
John, I... I need to ask you
to do something.

739
00:47:16,501 --> 00:47:17,961
No.

740
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:19,712
You don't know
what it is I'm gonna say.

741
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:21,005
Well, whatever it is, no.

742
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,299
I need you to let your flat go
and move back in with us.

743
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:25,510
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

744
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:28,555
I feel like I'm being
cuckolded by a ghost.

745
00:47:28,638 --> 00:47:31,724
John, I just...
I really need to do this.

746
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,270
I'm sorry.

747
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:36,646
(John sighs)

748
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:42,318
It's colossal, isn't it, dad?

749
00:47:42,402 --> 00:47:43,653
It is.

750
00:47:43,736 --> 00:47:47,448
The thing about mons Meg
is it soon became obsolete

751
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:51,744
because it was so heavy,
they couldn't move it anywhere.

752
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:54,872
So it wasn't so much
a colossal gun in the end

753
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,417
as a colossal waste of time.

754
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:58,501
He was talking to you,

755
00:47:58,585 --> 00:48:00,545
but really
he was saying that to mum.

756
00:48:00,628 --> 00:48:03,089
Ok, boys, it's nearly time
for the one o'clock gun.

757
00:48:03,172 --> 00:48:04,716
- Shall we go?
- Yeah.

758
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,684
(John)
The grass is always greener

759
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:17,103
- for you, Philippa, isn't it?
- (Max) Hurry up, raife.

760
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,606
Other women seem
perfectly happy with their lot.

761
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:21,566
I don't think they are.

762
00:48:21,649 --> 00:48:24,402
Is, erm, is that the picture
you were shown at school?

763
00:48:24,485 --> 00:48:25,945
- That one?
- (John) Yes.

764
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:27,864
The tudors doctored
that painting.

765
00:48:27,947 --> 00:48:29,073
Really?

766
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:31,159
It was x-rayed and proved
that they retouched it

767
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,328
to make him look evil.
Look at the thumb.

768
00:48:33,411 --> 00:48:36,581
It's been sharpened into a claw.
They narrowed his eyes

769
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:38,666
and made his lips
thinner and meaner.

770
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:41,336
That is what he really
looked like.

771
00:48:41,419 --> 00:48:45,089
Normal eyes, normal mouth,
normal thumb. See?

772
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:48,760
(John) Yes, but how can you
possibly find him on your own?

773
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:51,054
And even if you do, what then?

774
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:52,972
You're trying
to make him perfect.

775
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:55,224
He wasn't. None of us is.

776
00:48:55,308 --> 00:48:57,894
We always try to
demonise people,

777
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:00,146
or sanctify them.
You know, we're...

778
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:02,440
You know,
we're all in the middle.

779
00:49:02,523 --> 00:49:04,776
I mean, I'm sure Mother Teresa

780
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:07,695
left the top off the milk
now and then.

781
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:11,115
And, er, I'll bet that
genghis Khan

782
00:49:11,199 --> 00:49:13,284
occasionally picked up
bits of litter.

783
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:15,995
Yeah. Human.

784
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,873
Not perfect and not a...
Not a demon either.

785
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:21,834
(Sighs) You always do
the same thing, Philippa.

786
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:23,336
You pretend to ask me something,

787
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:26,589
but the truth is, you just
put a gun against my head.

788
00:49:26,673 --> 00:49:27,715
(Cannon fires)

789
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:04,168
Hi. Er, Philippa Langley
here to see mr Buckley, please.

790
00:50:04,252 --> 00:50:06,546
And which company are you from?

791
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,799
Oh, no. I'm not with a company,
but he is expecting me.

792
00:50:10,717 --> 00:50:12,093
Cheers.

793
00:50:14,721 --> 00:50:18,599
Erm, actually, sorry.
You don't...

794
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:22,061
You don't happen to have
a knife, do you, at all?

795
00:50:22,145 --> 00:50:24,731
You're gonna have to take this
meeting on your own, Mathew.

796
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:25,815
I've got too much to do.

797
00:50:25,898 --> 00:50:27,692
The bloody thing's
been forced on us anyway.

798
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,986
Richard,
this is Philippa Langley.

799
00:50:30,069 --> 00:50:33,823
- Hello. Richard Buckley.
- Hello. Erm...

800
00:50:33,906 --> 00:50:36,159
This is my deputy,
Mathew Morris.

801
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:38,411
Sorry, can I sit down, please?

802
00:50:38,494 --> 00:50:40,246
Er, yes, there, of course.
Erm...

803
00:50:40,329 --> 00:50:41,372
Thank you.

804
00:50:41,456 --> 00:50:43,541
Is anything...
Anything the matter?

805
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:46,461
So sorry, I've got me
and it's a real illness.

806
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:49,756
It... it comes on
at times of stress.

807
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,632
Would you like a glass of water?

808
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,469
(Philippa) Yes, please,
that'd be lovely. Thank you.

809
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,387
- Would you like to reschedule?
- No.

810
00:50:56,471 --> 00:51:01,434
Erm, actually, I've...
I've... got a cake for you.

811
00:51:01,517 --> 00:51:03,436
- Not for me.
- Thank you very much.

812
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,271
(Philippa)
It's, er, lemon drizzle.

813
00:51:05,354 --> 00:51:07,106
Your receptionist
gave me a knife.

814
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,232
Thank you.

815
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:10,610
- (Philippa) Thank you so much.
- Pleasure.

816
00:51:11,277 --> 00:51:13,279
So you're a friend of the mayor?

817
00:51:13,362 --> 00:51:15,615
- No.
- Oh, I thought...

818
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:19,994
My friend used to live next
door to him, so I sort of...

819
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,580
I sort of used him
to get to you.

820
00:51:23,581 --> 00:51:26,209
- And it worked.
- (Philippa) Hmm.

821
00:51:26,292 --> 00:51:29,796
- So, er, what is it you wanted?
- Thank you.

822
00:51:29,879 --> 00:51:31,798
Erm...

823
00:51:31,881 --> 00:51:35,009
I've... I've got
a archaeological proposal

824
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:37,345
about Richard III that might...

825
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,138
I hope would be
of interest to you.

826
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,890
Ok.

827
00:51:40,973 --> 00:51:44,018
I'm planning to raise the funds
to pay you, of course.

828
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,895
Ok.

829
00:51:47,939 --> 00:51:49,899
Do you want me to start talking
about it now?

830
00:51:49,982 --> 00:51:51,984
Please do. (Chuckles)

831
00:51:53,194 --> 00:51:56,155
- I want to dig for Richard.
- For Richard?

832
00:51:56,239 --> 00:51:57,573
Yes.

833
00:51:57,657 --> 00:52:00,618
And what is it
you want to dig for?

834
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:04,163
Richard.

835
00:52:04,247 --> 00:52:05,498
The third.

836
00:52:05,581 --> 00:52:08,918
Yes, in connection
with Richard III,

837
00:52:09,001 --> 00:52:10,920
what is it
you're hoping to find?

838
00:52:11,838 --> 00:52:13,214
Him. Him.

839
00:52:15,508 --> 00:52:16,843
- Him?
- (Philippa) Yes.

840
00:52:18,427 --> 00:52:19,929
I think I know where he is.

841
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,726
I'm really sorry.
I think I need some air.

842
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,019
(Buckley) Oh, of course.

843
00:52:27,103 --> 00:52:28,646
- I'm so sorry.
- Let me help you.

844
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:30,356
- Would you mind?
- Could you?

845
00:52:30,439 --> 00:52:32,733
- Yes, of course. Of course.
- There we are.

846
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,068
There we go.

847
00:52:35,236 --> 00:52:37,029
- Thank you.
- That's the way.

848
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:42,451
(Buckley)
So, where do you think he is?

849
00:52:42,535 --> 00:52:45,788
It's my understanding that
his remains were thrown into...

850
00:52:45,872 --> 00:52:47,748
He wasn't thrown
into the river soar.

851
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,377
I read that in your book

852
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:54,297
and that rumour
has been since discredited.

853
00:52:56,007 --> 00:53:00,469
Well, you may well be right.
He may be out there somewhere.

854
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:02,805
But even if we...
Even if we can pinpoint

855
00:53:02,889 --> 00:53:04,640
where greyfriars once stood,

856
00:53:04,724 --> 00:53:07,226
finding him would be
virtually impossible.

857
00:53:07,310 --> 00:53:10,438
Literally finding a needle
in a haystack would be easier.

858
00:53:10,521 --> 00:53:13,482
Well, according to
the historian John ashdown-hill,

859
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:15,026
the site of greyfriars

860
00:53:15,109 --> 00:53:17,111
would probably still be
an open space somewhere.

861
00:53:18,571 --> 00:53:19,989
So, can you help me?

862
00:53:21,866 --> 00:53:22,867
No.

863
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:26,412
- Oh.
- I don't look for people.

864
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:28,372
If you go and look
for a single thing...

865
00:53:28,456 --> 00:53:30,124
He just called me a thing.

866
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:34,879
Please don't call him that.
He is a person, not a thing.

867
00:53:34,962 --> 00:53:36,505
Ok, I'm just saying,

868
00:53:36,589 --> 00:53:39,926
I don't go looking
for one specific thing.

869
00:53:40,009 --> 00:53:41,260
He just said it again.

870
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:43,888
- You just said it again.
- Sorry.

871
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:45,806
Er, the point I'm trying to make

872
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:49,018
is that's not how
archaeology works.

873
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:52,146
All right, well, erm...

874
00:53:53,856 --> 00:53:55,942
Well, how about
we look for a church?

875
00:53:56,025 --> 00:53:58,235
The whole church,
not just Richard?

876
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,781
What can you show us to back up
any of what you're saying?

877
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:05,409
Actually, would you mind?
Thank you so much.

878
00:54:06,327 --> 00:54:10,831
Well, here's the relevant
parts of my research.

879
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:13,000
Well, why don't you
leave this with me,

880
00:54:13,084 --> 00:54:16,879
- and I'll get back to you?
- Of course, yes.

881
00:54:16,963 --> 00:54:18,547
I've got copies.
You can keep that.

882
00:54:18,631 --> 00:54:19,882
Thank you.

883
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:24,762
- So, are you feeling better now?
- Much.

884
00:54:26,764 --> 00:54:29,016
Goodbye, mr Buckley.

885
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:31,686
- Richard.
- The third, yes.

886
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:34,063
No. That's my name. Richard.

887
00:54:34,146 --> 00:54:36,691
- (Laughs)
- Of course it is.

888
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,234
Goodbye, Richard.

889
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:40,820
- Thank you for the cake.
- My pleasure.

890
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:44,115
- Bye, Mathew.
- Goodbye.

891
00:54:44,198 --> 00:54:45,408
- Yes.
- Thank you.

892
00:54:47,076 --> 00:54:49,870
I'll tell the lord mayor's
office that we've met her,

893
00:54:49,954 --> 00:54:52,373
duty done, and email her
thanks, but no, thanks.

894
00:54:52,456 --> 00:54:53,749
Yep, ok.

895
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,878
It's funny.
I do enjoy talking to you.

896
00:54:57,962 --> 00:54:59,630
If it's to tell me again
how ugly I am,

897
00:54:59,714 --> 00:55:01,716
I'd, er, rather
you didn't bother.

898
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,175
(Philippa sighs)

899
00:55:04,593 --> 00:55:06,971
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

900
00:55:08,848 --> 00:55:11,308
- The princes in the tower.
- Hmm.

901
00:55:11,392 --> 00:55:14,729
- Your nephews.
- What about them?

902
00:55:15,771 --> 00:55:18,024
Well, what...
What happened to them?

903
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:23,112
What do you think
happened to them?

904
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:24,905
I don't know.

905
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:27,324
Well, lots of people say you
killed them or had them killed

906
00:55:27,408 --> 00:55:30,036
so you could become king, but...

907
00:55:31,162 --> 00:55:32,246
Did you?

908
00:55:33,205 --> 00:55:34,832
You're really asking me that?

909
00:55:37,126 --> 00:55:41,172
Well, I know Edward
also had five daughters.

910
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:44,884
And then there was your
older brother George's son.

911
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:47,511
And your sister had seven sons,

912
00:55:47,595 --> 00:55:50,014
and they all had claims
to the throne.

913
00:55:51,015 --> 00:55:54,852
So if you killed one,
you'd have to kill them all.

914
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,521
And that's what I tell people.

915
00:55:57,605 --> 00:55:58,606
(Chuckles quietly)

916
00:56:03,986 --> 00:56:06,280
No. I... I'm sorry.

917
00:56:07,114 --> 00:56:11,160
Please don't go.
I'm just trying to understand.

918
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:19,543
I'm sorry.

919
00:56:19,627 --> 00:56:21,629
(Door opens)

920
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:25,800
(Door shuts)

921
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:29,970
- Hey.
- How did it go?

922
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:36,143
Erm, hard to say. Ok, I think.
I don't know.

923
00:56:36,227 --> 00:56:38,854
It's just, suddenly,
it feels like, erm...

924
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:40,815
Well, it's a bit scary
because it's...

925
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:43,901
I feel it's the last-chance
saloon, you know?

926
00:56:45,611 --> 00:56:48,030
How'd it go with, erm,
sea... Sarah.

927
00:56:48,114 --> 00:56:49,281
Yes, go on, seafood Sarah.

928
00:56:49,365 --> 00:56:51,283
I know what
you and the boys call her.

929
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:54,078
- Sorry.
- Anyway, we split up.

930
00:56:54,161 --> 00:56:55,913
Oh, no! Why?

931
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,957
Because she bored
the bloody pants off me.

932
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,751
A bit too normal, then.

933
00:57:00,835 --> 00:57:03,754
Every sentence started
with, "to tell the truth."

934
00:57:03,838 --> 00:57:07,091
Why would she automatically
assume I thought she was lying?

935
00:57:08,676 --> 00:57:09,677
Nothing else?

936
00:57:10,886 --> 00:57:14,807
- (Sighs) She had big feet.
- There it is.

937
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:18,602
You know, er, Richard III,

938
00:57:18,686 --> 00:57:22,106
he may have been, er,
a wise and just leader

939
00:57:22,189 --> 00:57:24,567
and I'm sure
had he lived longer,

940
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,443
he would've avoided
all the bloodshed

941
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,029
of the reformation
and, you know, whatever.

942
00:57:29,113 --> 00:57:32,158
But would he have sold
his collection

943
00:57:32,241 --> 00:57:35,411
of sex pistols memorabilia
to help pay for a new kitchen?

944
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:40,291
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
All day long. No question.

945
00:57:40,374 --> 00:57:44,336
Would he have driven 15 miles,
on a Sunday,

946
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:47,715
to a service station
to buy his pregnant wife

947
00:57:47,798 --> 00:57:49,800
a greggs cheese and onion pasty?

948
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:54,722
No, he would've ridden there.
On his white steed.

949
00:57:55,806 --> 00:57:57,183
That's what he would have done.

950
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:17,328
(John sighs)

951
00:58:17,411 --> 00:58:19,371
Do we really want to go
down that path again?

952
00:58:21,665 --> 00:58:23,500
- Probably not.
- No.

953
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:32,259
- Night, love.
- Goodnight.

954
00:58:34,678 --> 00:58:36,096
(Philippa) Sleep well.

955
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:56,533
(Door slams)

956
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:58,410
How did it go?

957
00:58:58,494 --> 00:59:00,996
"The university
faces challenging times."

958
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,666
"Profound regret.
Blah-di-bloody-blah."

959
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:05,251
They're shutting us down?

960
00:59:05,334 --> 00:59:08,420
They've withdrawn
their funding. Fuck!

961
00:59:08,504 --> 00:59:10,631
I've just ordered new laptops
for everyone.

962
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,384
We're not shutting down, ok?

963
00:59:13,467 --> 00:59:16,262
Instead of working exclusively
for the university,

964
00:59:16,345 --> 00:59:19,974
we'll just have to find funding
from other sources.

965
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:24,770
Mathew, did you send
that email to, er, Philippa?

966
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:26,397
The cake lady?

967
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,649
Er, no, I don't think
I have yet, no.

968
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,652
Good. Don't.
Arrange another meeting.

969
00:59:37,283 --> 00:59:39,203
When I got the call,
I was convinced it would be,

970
00:59:39,285 --> 00:59:41,328
- "thanks, but no, thanks."
- Oh, no, no, no.

971
00:59:41,412 --> 00:59:43,580
- (Mathew) Don't be silly.
- It's a new era for us.

972
00:59:43,664 --> 00:59:46,959
We are available for hire.
Ah, there we are.

973
00:59:50,671 --> 00:59:51,922
Oh, wow.

974
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:56,635
So, that's st Martin's church.
Now the cathedral.

975
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:00,681
That's Robert herrick's garden.

976
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:04,643
We found it in
the council archives.

977
01:00:04,727 --> 01:00:07,855
I've heard about this map,
but I never thought I'd see it.

978
01:00:09,898 --> 01:00:11,233
What's that there?

979
01:00:11,317 --> 01:00:14,778
Some sort of garden feature.
A pagoda?

980
01:00:16,196 --> 01:00:18,073
Well, herrick was rumoured
to have a king

981
01:00:18,157 --> 01:00:20,075
buried in his back garden.

982
01:00:20,159 --> 01:00:22,536
A circular feature with
four pathways leading to it

983
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,747
says, "come and have a look
at what I've got."

984
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:26,790
Hmm!

985
01:00:26,874 --> 01:00:29,752
It's hard to be precise
about where that is, though.

986
01:00:29,835 --> 01:00:34,131
Erm, maps from that long ago
very often weren't to scale.

987
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:35,299
Right.

988
01:00:37,176 --> 01:00:39,094
What about
if we just superimpose this

989
01:00:39,178 --> 01:00:40,304
over a modern map?

990
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:42,973
No, that won't work because...

991
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:47,061
Well, I don't know why not,
actually.

992
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,355
Erm, has that been done before,
Mathew?

993
01:00:49,438 --> 01:00:51,815
- Worth a try, surely?
- Hmm.

994
01:00:55,986 --> 01:00:57,071
(Richard) Hmm.

995
01:00:57,863 --> 01:01:00,532
(Mathew)
So, here is the modern map.

996
01:01:00,616 --> 01:01:03,452
And here's the old one.

997
01:01:03,535 --> 01:01:09,666
Er, Leicester cathedral
was then, erm, at st Martin's.

998
01:01:09,750 --> 01:01:13,087
Friar Lane is, er...

999
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:15,964
Oh, still the same,
just, er, spelt differently.

1000
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,592
Now, cank street.
Where's cank street?

1001
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:22,304
Cank street is now st Martin's.

1002
01:01:22,388 --> 01:01:27,059
And, er, high street
is south gates.

1003
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:29,937
(Buckley) Well, if
the herrick map is accurate...

1004
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,188
(Mathew) And to scale.

1005
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:33,941
(Buckley) ...Whatever it is
in herrick's garden

1006
01:01:34,024 --> 01:01:37,611
is now right in the middle of
the social services car park.

1007
01:01:47,746 --> 01:01:49,623
It's still an open space.

1008
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:55,963
Perhaps we should start
looking there.

1009
01:01:56,964 --> 01:01:58,257
For greyfriars.

1010
01:02:00,843 --> 01:02:03,220
If we're saying this
is about finding the church,

1011
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:06,640
then on that basis... I'm in.

1012
01:02:08,684 --> 01:02:09,852
Thank you.

1013
01:02:09,935 --> 01:02:13,647
- (Buckley) It won't be cheap.
- I'll raise the funds.

1014
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,482
You need the council
to help with that

1015
01:02:15,566 --> 01:02:18,026
- and with all the permits.
- (Mathew) I'll help.

1016
01:02:18,986 --> 01:02:20,237
I know.

1017
01:02:31,957 --> 01:02:34,751
I'm Sarah levitt and I'm head
of arts and museums

1018
01:02:34,835 --> 01:02:36,545
for Leicester city council.

1019
01:02:36,628 --> 01:02:38,046
And now Philippa is here

1020
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,632
to answer any queries
that we may have.

1021
01:02:40,716 --> 01:02:41,758
Thank you.

1022
01:02:41,842 --> 01:02:44,011
Philippa. Martin Peters.

1023
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:46,430
I run an organisation
which promotes leicestershire.

1024
01:02:46,513 --> 01:02:49,850
- Hi.
- What's your funding plan?

1025
01:02:49,933 --> 01:02:53,645
Well, I wanted to put it out to
a number of interested parties,

1026
01:02:53,729 --> 01:02:55,105
including yourself.

1027
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,774
Erm, the council,
Leicester university.

1028
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,860
And then hopefully
make up any shortfall

1029
01:02:59,943 --> 01:03:02,237
by pitching it
to potential sponsors.

1030
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,740
Richard Taylor, Leicester uni.

1031
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:07,201
Now, we, potentially,

1032
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,536
might have some funding
we could put in.

1033
01:03:09,620 --> 01:03:13,874
But I'm concerned
about your costs.

1034
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:17,002
I mean,
radar survey of the site.

1035
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:19,129
Digging up the car park.

1036
01:03:19,213 --> 01:03:21,465
Paying
for everyone's car parking

1037
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:22,966
whilst the dig
is being carried out.

1038
01:03:23,050 --> 01:03:24,551
Reinstating the car park.

1039
01:03:24,635 --> 01:03:27,179
I mean... what is your budget?

1040
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:28,847
Forty, 50k?

1041
01:03:28,931 --> 01:03:30,682
Thirty-five.

1042
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:33,185
And the rest?

1043
01:03:33,268 --> 01:03:35,479
The thing is, we don't know

1044
01:03:35,562 --> 01:03:39,191
how long the car park will
remain just that, a car park.

1045
01:03:39,274 --> 01:03:40,317
There are rumours

1046
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,819
that the site might be sold
and redeveloped.

1047
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:45,572
And then that chance
is gone forever.

1048
01:03:46,907 --> 01:03:51,995
I... I believe that this is a
very important historical site.

1049
01:03:53,205 --> 01:03:56,250
I've the strongest feeling
about this.

1050
01:03:57,918 --> 01:04:00,671
You see, for me,
a feeling is what you get

1051
01:04:00,754 --> 01:04:02,798
when you sit on a bus seat
that's still warm.

1052
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:04,716
(Chuckles quietly)

1053
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:08,554
Supposing, against all the odds,
that you do find a body,

1054
01:04:08,637 --> 01:04:12,641
that you believe to be that
of Richard III,

1055
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:15,227
how can you possibly prove
that it's him?

1056
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,311
Well, actually...

1057
01:04:16,395 --> 01:04:17,854
Because it's got
all the hallmarks

1058
01:04:17,938 --> 01:04:19,231
of being a wild-goose chase.

1059
01:04:19,314 --> 01:04:21,942
If you could just let
Philippa answer.

1060
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:23,193
(Philippa) Thank you.

1061
01:04:24,403 --> 01:04:28,323
Actually, erm,
the historian John ashdown-hill

1062
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:31,493
has traced living descendants
of Richard's

1063
01:04:32,411 --> 01:04:33,662
back through 500 years

1064
01:04:33,745 --> 01:04:35,706
of the female mitochondrial
DNA line.

1065
01:04:35,789 --> 01:04:41,336
So... a simple DNA test
would establish definitively

1066
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:43,046
whether any remains were his.

1067
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:47,884
Any other questions? No?

1068
01:04:47,968 --> 01:04:49,386
Thank you, Philippa.

1069
01:04:49,469 --> 01:04:50,887
If you'd like to wait
downstairs,

1070
01:04:50,971 --> 01:04:52,180
we'll discuss this further.

1071
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:53,515
Sure. Thank you.

1072
01:05:00,814 --> 01:05:02,107
Thank you so much.

1073
01:05:08,030 --> 01:05:10,198
Now, I'm sure this woman
means well,

1074
01:05:10,282 --> 01:05:11,700
but it's important
to acknowledge

1075
01:05:11,783 --> 01:05:13,410
that she's an amateur.

1076
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:15,037
And she has an emotional dynamic

1077
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,039
which I don't think
is very helpful.

1078
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:21,168
My concern is for the reputation
of the university,

1079
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,170
should this whole thing
become a fiasco.

1080
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:29,301
Huh! I mean, Richard III,
under a car park. (Chuckles)

1081
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:41,229
- Hi.
- Hi. (Clears throat)

1082
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:43,106
It's been approved.
Congratulations.

1083
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:44,399
- What? No!
- Yes.

1084
01:05:44,483 --> 01:05:45,609
- No!
- Yes.

1085
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,819
Oh, and you are also
fully funded.

1086
01:05:47,903 --> 01:05:50,781
Martin Peters from
leicestershire promotions

1087
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,532
has agreed to give you
the full 35k.

1088
01:05:52,616 --> 01:05:54,868
He thinks the publicity
would be great for the city,

1089
01:05:54,951 --> 01:05:56,662
- and I agree.
- Oh, my goodness.

1090
01:05:56,745 --> 01:05:58,372
Oh, thank you so much.

1091
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:00,332
Now, can I give you
a piece of advice?

1092
01:06:00,415 --> 01:06:01,667
Of course, yes.

1093
01:06:01,750 --> 01:06:03,835
Please don't mention
your feelings again.

1094
01:06:04,753 --> 01:06:05,796
Right, yes, of course.

1095
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,005
- I keep doing that.
- Yes.

1096
01:06:07,089 --> 01:06:09,299
People love to use that
as a stick to beat you with.

1097
01:06:09,383 --> 01:06:12,427
- Especially if you're a woman.
- Of course. Thank you so much.

1098
01:06:12,511 --> 01:06:14,971
This is the equivalent of
someone with a homemade rocket

1099
01:06:15,055 --> 01:06:16,682
saying they're gonna reach
the moon.

1100
01:06:16,765 --> 01:06:18,266
That's how we should
look at this.

1101
01:06:18,350 --> 01:06:21,561
Be hilarious if she actually
found him though, wouldn't it?

1102
01:06:21,645 --> 01:06:24,940
Would it? Be hilarious?

1103
01:06:33,573 --> 01:06:35,826
- Hello.
- She seemed nice.

1104
01:06:35,909 --> 01:06:38,578
Sarah? Yeah, she is. Very.

1105
01:06:39,413 --> 01:06:40,414
Erm...

1106
01:06:43,375 --> 01:06:45,377
I didn't think I was gonna
see you again

1107
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:48,797
after, you know,
the other night.

1108
01:06:50,465 --> 01:06:54,386
I'm sorry, I... I mean,
I know it's a touchy subject.

1109
01:06:56,388 --> 01:06:59,099
I believe you, by the way.

1110
01:07:00,142 --> 01:07:03,562
I definitely don't think
you did... kill them.

1111
01:07:06,022 --> 01:07:07,649
Just to clear that up.

1112
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:11,778
I thought you were really
impressive with those people.

1113
01:07:15,115 --> 01:07:16,408
Thank you.

1114
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:22,456
(Philippa) Exciting, isn't it?

1115
01:07:22,539 --> 01:07:25,625
(Buckley) I think it's a waste
of money. In my experience,

1116
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:29,379
you hardly ever get anything
definitive from radar surveys.

1117
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:31,047
(Machine beeps)

1118
01:07:48,231 --> 01:07:51,109
Results from the radar survey.
All negative.

1119
01:07:51,193 --> 01:07:53,153
Well, that can't be right.

1120
01:07:53,236 --> 01:07:54,946
They didn't spot anything, John.

1121
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:58,074
There's no walls,
no foundation, no graves.

1122
01:07:58,158 --> 01:08:00,410
There must've been something
there before the car park.

1123
01:08:00,494 --> 01:08:03,079
There's no way they'll let me
go ahead with the dig now.

1124
01:08:03,914 --> 01:08:05,707
What does Richard say?

1125
01:08:10,128 --> 01:08:11,296
- Richard?
- Hmm.

1126
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:14,257
- Why don't you ask his opinion?
- He doesn't mean me.

1127
01:08:16,718 --> 01:08:18,553
- Buckley?
- (John) Hmm.

1128
01:08:18,637 --> 01:08:20,263
Richard Buckley, yes, of course.

1129
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:22,265
I did warn you.

1130
01:08:23,141 --> 01:08:24,768
(Philippa) Yes, I know. I know.

1131
01:08:24,851 --> 01:08:26,478
But what do we do now?

1132
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:29,064
Well, have you spoken
to Sarah levitt this morning?

1133
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:30,398
No. Why?

1134
01:08:30,482 --> 01:08:33,652
More bad news, I'm afraid.

1135
01:08:33,735 --> 01:08:36,404
Leicestershire promotions
have pulled out.

1136
01:08:36,488 --> 01:08:37,989
(Gasps)

1137
01:08:38,657 --> 01:08:40,158
But that's all our funding.

1138
01:08:40,242 --> 01:08:43,870
Sarah did say the council
will still support you for now,

1139
01:08:43,954 --> 01:08:47,207
but you're gonna need to raise
new finance very quickly.

1140
01:08:47,290 --> 01:08:49,292
Well, what about
Leicester university?

1141
01:08:49,376 --> 01:08:51,586
Surely with you involved,
they can't just ignore me?

1142
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:54,673
Leicester university is not
a benevolent seat of learning.

1143
01:08:54,756 --> 01:08:55,799
It's a business.

1144
01:08:56,842 --> 01:08:59,386
And they've recently
dispensed with my services.

1145
01:08:59,469 --> 01:09:03,056
Oh, Richard, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea. I...

1146
01:09:04,391 --> 01:09:07,102
Have faith in your research,
Philippa.

1147
01:09:08,436 --> 01:09:10,564
Have faith in yourself.

1148
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:15,026
If you're asking if
I'm still in, the answer's yes.

1149
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:18,405
Thank you. Thank you, Richard.

1150
01:09:20,031 --> 01:09:21,283
Yes, bye.

1151
01:09:26,705 --> 01:09:28,415
Hooray for Richard Buckley.

1152
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,710
At least he hasn't abandoned us.

1153
01:09:32,460 --> 01:09:34,796
- What about the funds you need?
- I don't know, really.

1154
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:37,007
I... suppose
I'll have to think of something.

1155
01:09:38,174 --> 01:09:40,677
The main thing is that
they haven't closed us down.

1156
01:09:42,262 --> 01:09:43,555
Completely.

1157
01:09:45,098 --> 01:09:47,058
- Dad?
- Yes, raife?

1158
01:09:47,976 --> 01:09:49,936
Mum talks to herself.

1159
01:09:52,939 --> 01:09:54,983
Well, we all do.

1160
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:02,407
Er, a few blisters, but, er...

1161
01:10:03,658 --> 01:10:06,411
- Well?
- He's asking too much for it.

1162
01:10:06,494 --> 01:10:09,581
What you wanna do
is go in at £3,750.

1163
01:10:09,664 --> 01:10:14,669
Tell him four's your top offer,
and settle for £4,250.

1164
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,422
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

1165
01:10:17,505 --> 01:10:19,132
- Hi, mum.
- Mum!

1166
01:10:19,215 --> 01:10:21,468
- Hello, darlings.
- Any luck?

1167
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:25,221
Erm, managed to claw back £5,000
from leicestershire promotions.

1168
01:10:25,305 --> 01:10:27,223
- But that's about it.
- Oh, that's... good.

1169
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:28,934
Suddenly everyone's
got cold feet.

1170
01:10:29,017 --> 01:10:30,644
- Mum!
- I don't quite know what to do.

1171
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:33,688
- Yes, darling?
- (John) Ok, well, look. Not now.

1172
01:10:33,772 --> 01:10:35,857
Perhaps it's, you know,
an opportunity

1173
01:10:35,941 --> 01:10:38,818
- to take stock of everything.
- What do you mean?

1174
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:41,488
Well, you know, I don't plan
on spending the rest of my life

1175
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,573
- sleeping on a sofa.
- Mum.

1176
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:46,117
- Yes?
- Dad's getting a new car!

1177
01:10:46,201 --> 01:10:48,703
- Is he really? Very nice.
- (Doorbell rings)

1178
01:10:48,787 --> 01:10:49,913
Perhaps he can drop you

1179
01:10:49,996 --> 01:10:52,082
right in front of the school
now, can't he? Hmm?

1180
01:10:52,165 --> 01:10:54,542
(Doorbell rings)

1181
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:57,003
She hasn't made us
any dinner again.

1182
01:10:57,087 --> 01:10:59,381
- It's disgraceful.
- Shut up, raife.

1183
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:00,590
Yeah, shut up, raife.

1184
01:11:00,674 --> 01:11:02,514
(John) Come on, let's go
into town, get a bite.

1185
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:05,470
- Come on through.
- Get out of her hair.

1186
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:07,806
Everybody, this is,
erm, Annette, Hamish

1187
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:09,766
from the society. Max and raife.

1188
01:11:09,849 --> 01:11:12,394
And this is my, erm...
Well, this is John.

1189
01:11:12,477 --> 01:11:13,520
- Ex-husband.
- Yeah.

1190
01:11:13,603 --> 01:11:15,313
What are you doing?
Are you coming, going?

1191
01:11:15,397 --> 01:11:17,065
We're gonna go into town,
get a bite.

1192
01:11:17,148 --> 01:11:18,483
(Philippa) Quick as you can.

1193
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:20,694
We will stay out
as long as is humanly possible.

1194
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,445
Take your time. Come through.

1195
01:11:22,529 --> 01:11:23,863
(Raife) If I had two sons,

1196
01:11:23,947 --> 01:11:25,949
I would make sure
they had something to eat

1197
01:11:26,032 --> 01:11:28,243
before I went looking
for Richard III.

1198
01:11:29,411 --> 01:11:30,745
(John sighs)

1199
01:11:31,871 --> 01:11:33,873
I'm wondering now
if we make a direct appeal

1200
01:11:33,957 --> 01:11:36,584
to the ricardians
to raise some funds for the dig.

1201
01:11:36,668 --> 01:11:39,379
- A crowd fund.
- Yes, exactly that.

1202
01:11:40,088 --> 01:11:42,132
Er, what do you want to call it?

1203
01:11:42,215 --> 01:11:44,968
Oh, I couldn't decide
between digging the king

1204
01:11:45,051 --> 01:11:46,636
because it works on two levels.

1205
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:50,557
We are actually digging for him
and also want people to...

1206
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:52,892
"Dig" Richard.

1207
01:11:52,976 --> 01:11:56,062
Yeah, I-I got that.
What's the other title?

1208
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:59,607
- Looking for Richard project.
- (Both) Call it that.

1209
01:12:00,108 --> 01:12:01,192
Right.

1210
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:08,033
Should that be "sudden
and unexpected shortfall"?

1211
01:12:08,116 --> 01:12:09,284
- Hmm.
- Ok.

1212
01:12:09,367 --> 01:12:10,869
That's good.

1213
01:12:14,372 --> 01:12:16,624
- Happy?
- I think so.

1214
01:12:16,708 --> 01:12:19,169
Certainly better
than what I had.

1215
01:12:19,252 --> 01:12:21,087
- Send?
- Yeah.

1216
01:12:22,922 --> 01:12:24,549
- (Laptop chimes)
- (Hamish) That's it.

1217
01:12:24,632 --> 01:12:26,885
Three and half thousand
society members.

1218
01:12:26,968 --> 01:12:30,221
If everyone sends in a pound,
be a good start, wouldn't it?

1219
01:12:30,305 --> 01:12:32,640
I'd say. Thank you so much.

1220
01:12:45,236 --> 01:12:47,447
(Couch creaks)

1221
01:12:50,742 --> 01:12:51,868
(Sighs)

1222
01:12:55,622 --> 01:12:57,165
(Phone buzzes)

1223
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,009
(Phone buzzes)

1224
01:13:14,099 --> 01:13:15,642
(Phone buzzes)

1225
01:13:26,528 --> 01:13:27,904
(Sighs)

1226
01:13:30,031 --> 01:13:31,491
(Phone buzzes)

1227
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,827
There are still emails
coming in from america,

1228
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:38,373
Australia, South Africa,
Germany, Canada, Brazil.

1229
01:13:38,456 --> 01:13:40,333
So, how much has been pledged?

1230
01:13:40,416 --> 01:13:44,087
Oh, well, the current total is,
er...

1231
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:48,091
£26,374 and rising.

1232
01:13:48,174 --> 01:13:49,467
I can't believe it.

1233
01:13:49,551 --> 01:13:52,512
Our own chairman has
donated £5,000 all by himself.

1234
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:53,763
- Phil stone?
- Yeah.

1235
01:13:53,847 --> 01:13:56,474
And another £2,000
from an anonymous source.

1236
01:13:57,433 --> 01:14:00,103
People have been so generous,
it's overwhelming.

1237
01:14:01,146 --> 01:14:02,814
I think it's gonna happen.

1238
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:14,659
(Woman) Can we keep this clear,
please?

1239
01:14:15,493 --> 01:14:16,870
(Man) Over here, please.

1240
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,882
Oh, very patriotic.

1241
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:48,151
- Right.
- Thank you.

1242
01:14:48,234 --> 01:14:49,611
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much.

1243
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:50,778
I'll need it.

1244
01:14:52,155 --> 01:14:54,324
(Tannoy) The train
now standing at platform three

1245
01:14:54,407 --> 01:14:57,535
is the 10:25 service
to inverness.

1246
01:14:57,619 --> 01:15:02,874
Calling at haymarket,
falkirk, stirling, dunblane,

1247
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:06,586
gleneagles, Perth, dunkeld,

1248
01:15:06,669 --> 01:15:09,130
pitlochry, Blair atholl...

1249
01:15:11,341 --> 01:15:12,884
What's wrong?

1250
01:15:18,556 --> 01:15:20,099
Where's the new car?

1251
01:15:21,226 --> 01:15:23,269
The boys said
you were getting a new car.

1252
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,730
What?

1253
01:15:25,813 --> 01:15:27,232
It was you, wasn't it?

1254
01:15:28,274 --> 01:15:30,860
Two thousand pounds
for the appeal.

1255
01:15:30,944 --> 01:15:32,570
It was the boys' idea.

1256
01:15:32,654 --> 01:15:34,072
They insisted.

1257
01:15:39,953 --> 01:15:41,537
You're a good man, John.

1258
01:15:42,914 --> 01:15:44,499
Hmm. That's fair.

1259
01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,600
Hi, Richard. What's happening?

1260
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:05,895
As we discussed, three trenches.
Maximum the budget will allow.

1261
01:16:05,979 --> 01:16:07,814
And in order to give ourselves
the best chance

1262
01:16:07,897 --> 01:16:10,316
of finding
one of the walls of greyfriars,

1263
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:12,110
I'm gonna cut them
north to south.

1264
01:16:12,193 --> 01:16:15,613
Here. One there.
And another one over there.

1265
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:18,199
- Trench one will start here.
- Ok.

1266
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:21,577
And run all the way
down this way

1267
01:16:21,661 --> 01:16:25,331
to round about here.

1268
01:16:25,415 --> 01:16:27,375
- To about here?
- That's right, yeah.

1269
01:16:27,458 --> 01:16:29,294
Ooh, by the way,
I meant to tell you,

1270
01:16:29,377 --> 01:16:31,212
I signed the exhumation licence.

1271
01:16:31,296 --> 01:16:33,840
The paperwork arrived
at the office this morning.

1272
01:16:33,923 --> 01:16:36,009
I couldn't remember
if you had any comments.

1273
01:16:36,092 --> 01:16:37,844
I just wanted to get it
out of the way.

1274
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,096
Saves a lot of fannying around.

1275
01:16:40,179 --> 01:16:43,057
Course, it's not an issue
unless we find him.

1276
01:16:43,141 --> 01:16:45,643
Er, does it matter
what end we start at?

1277
01:16:46,978 --> 01:16:49,355
Er... no.

1278
01:16:49,439 --> 01:16:51,899
Can we start at this end,
do you think?

1279
01:16:51,983 --> 01:16:54,902
- Any particular reason?
- No.

1280
01:16:55,820 --> 01:16:57,322
- Ok.
- Great.

1281
01:16:57,405 --> 01:17:00,074
- Groovy wellies.
- Thanks.

1282
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:05,288
(Saw whirs)

1283
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:18,760
(Cheering)

1284
01:17:29,604 --> 01:17:31,898
(Saw whirs)

1285
01:17:58,257 --> 01:17:59,634
Philippa.

1286
01:18:00,343 --> 01:18:01,636
John!

1287
01:18:02,470 --> 01:18:04,430
So glad you could make it!

1288
01:18:04,514 --> 01:18:06,766
- Who's that fellow over there?
- What?

1289
01:18:08,226 --> 01:18:10,436
Oh, that's, erm...
That's Richard Taylor.

1290
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,689
He's from Leicester university.
Why?

1291
01:18:13,773 --> 01:18:16,359
I rather thought you were the
driving force behind this dig,

1292
01:18:16,442 --> 01:18:18,069
but from what I could hear,

1293
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:20,530
apparently, it's all down
to the university.

1294
01:18:20,613 --> 01:18:21,948
What?

1295
01:18:22,031 --> 01:18:24,033
We're very excited
about what we might find.

1296
01:18:24,117 --> 01:18:25,535
Very excited.

1297
01:18:25,618 --> 01:18:28,746
And so, with the university
leading the search,

1298
01:18:28,830 --> 01:18:32,041
we can say with confidence
that if he's out there,

1299
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:33,918
we will find him.

1300
01:18:34,585 --> 01:18:35,711
- Richard.
- Ok?

1301
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:37,213
- (Reporter) That's great.
- Good.

1302
01:18:37,296 --> 01:18:39,006
- (Reporter) Thank you.
- What's going on?

1303
01:18:39,090 --> 01:18:41,342
Just a little interview
for the university website.

1304
01:18:41,426 --> 01:18:45,430
Erm, Leicester uni isn't leading
the search for Richard. I am.

1305
01:18:46,848 --> 01:18:49,267
You put in a little bit of
funding right at the last minute

1306
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,352
- and that's it.
- Come on now, Philippa.

1307
01:18:51,436 --> 01:18:53,938
- We're all in this together.
- (Buckley) Philippa.

1308
01:18:56,232 --> 01:18:58,151
- Excuse me.
- Hm-hmm.

1309
01:18:59,318 --> 01:19:01,404
Someone getting too big
for their fancy boots.

1310
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:02,488
(Philippa) What is it?

1311
01:19:02,572 --> 01:19:04,574
(Buckley) Philippa,
we've found some leg bones.

1312
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,242
- Leg bones?
- No feet with them.

1313
01:19:06,325 --> 01:19:08,536
Just the lower legs
sticking out into the trench.

1314
01:19:08,619 --> 01:19:10,371
(Buckley)
Looks like the feet were cut off

1315
01:19:10,455 --> 01:19:12,498
when they dug down
to put in sewage pipes

1316
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:14,000
a couple of hundred years ago.

1317
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,543
What about the rest of the body?

1318
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:17,503
(Buckley) Well,
if it's a complete burial,

1319
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:20,006
it's under there
outside the trench.

1320
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:23,092
It's almost certain this whole
area is outside the church,

1321
01:19:23,176 --> 01:19:25,178
which is our focus, remember?

1322
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:29,557
Probably a friar buried
in a little adjoining graveyard.

1323
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:31,100
Given the budget constraints

1324
01:19:31,184 --> 01:19:33,436
we're not gonna waste time
and money digging it out,

1325
01:19:33,519 --> 01:19:35,146
but, er, not a bad start, eh?

1326
01:19:35,229 --> 01:19:38,024
(Thunder)

1327
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:50,411
(Thunder)

1328
01:20:32,662 --> 01:20:33,955
What's the matter?

1329
01:20:37,124 --> 01:20:38,501
I'm worried.

1330
01:20:39,669 --> 01:20:40,878
What about?

1331
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:44,423
I won't find you.

1332
01:20:50,513 --> 01:20:51,806
Or that I will.

1333
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,978
There seems to be
some excitement this morning.

1334
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,689
Yes, we found the shadow
of a stone wall,

1335
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:02,066
which could be the cloister
wall of greyfriars church

1336
01:21:02,149 --> 01:21:03,651
in this trench here.

1337
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:06,195
And once we work out
the geography of the church,

1338
01:21:06,279 --> 01:21:07,947
we need to find the choir,

1339
01:21:08,030 --> 01:21:11,534
because that's where they buried
important people, apparently.

1340
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:15,663
I also believe that the bones
we found in trench one

1341
01:21:15,746 --> 01:21:18,082
could be very significant here.

1342
01:21:19,792 --> 01:21:23,087
- (Philippa) I'm so fed up.
- You're the client, Philippa.

1343
01:21:23,170 --> 01:21:25,298
You're entitled to ask
for whatever you want.

1344
01:21:25,381 --> 01:21:28,092
They never miss a chance
to put me in my place.

1345
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:30,011
It's exhausting.

1346
01:21:30,094 --> 01:21:32,263
Don't let them push you around.

1347
01:21:32,346 --> 01:21:33,681
I'll try my best.

1348
01:21:33,764 --> 01:21:35,057
Thanks, John.

1349
01:21:35,141 --> 01:21:36,767
We're all thinking of you here.

1350
01:21:36,851 --> 01:21:39,145
Stay strong and chin up, eh?
Bye-bye.

1351
01:21:39,228 --> 01:21:40,354
Bye, love.

1352
01:21:47,778 --> 01:21:50,448
This looks really promising.

1353
01:21:51,991 --> 01:21:55,620
I think this trench cuts across
the east end of the church.

1354
01:21:55,703 --> 01:21:58,539
So we are pretty close
to the choir here.

1355
01:21:58,623 --> 01:22:01,250
If we keep working
in this direction,

1356
01:22:01,334 --> 01:22:02,793
- give it another...
- Richard.

1357
01:22:03,919 --> 01:22:07,256
- Can I have a word, please?
- Of course.

1358
01:22:07,340 --> 01:22:09,258
I want to exhume
the rest of the remains

1359
01:22:09,342 --> 01:22:10,885
in trench one, please.

1360
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:12,345
Philippa, I've already told you,

1361
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:14,889
those are almost certainly
the remains of a friar.

1362
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:17,266
I don't think there's
any doubt about it, Richard.

1363
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:19,185
The depth they're buried at,

1364
01:22:19,268 --> 01:22:21,145
and they're too far west
to be in the choir.

1365
01:22:21,228 --> 01:22:23,773
- I agree.
- I want to dig him up, please.

1366
01:22:23,856 --> 01:22:25,316
I've stuck my neck out for you

1367
01:22:25,399 --> 01:22:29,487
because till now, I felt your
research was sound and thorough.

1368
01:22:29,570 --> 01:22:30,780
I think it's him.

1369
01:22:30,863 --> 01:22:33,282
Don't you think you've become
fixated on these bones

1370
01:22:33,366 --> 01:22:36,494
just because they were
the first ones we discovered?

1371
01:22:36,577 --> 01:22:40,539
What if that is part
of the choir, hmm? Over there?

1372
01:22:40,623 --> 01:22:42,541
What if you're wrong
and it is him?

1373
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:44,710
Myself and all
the professionals,

1374
01:22:44,794 --> 01:22:46,379
the assembled academics

1375
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:48,798
all say concentrate here
in trench three,

1376
01:22:48,881 --> 01:22:51,092
but you say, "no,
let's concentrate over there,"

1377
01:22:51,175 --> 01:22:54,220
because that's where you think
he is. Do you see my problem?

1378
01:22:54,303 --> 01:22:56,430
I want to exhume
the rest of those bones!

1379
01:22:56,514 --> 01:22:58,099
We can't.
We don't have the money to!

1380
01:22:58,182 --> 01:23:02,103
I've got about £800 left
in the fund. Will that cover it?

1381
01:23:06,232 --> 01:23:07,316
I suppose so.

1382
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:10,361
Well, can you just do it then?
Please.

1383
01:23:16,283 --> 01:23:18,077
Jo, dig out the remains
in trench one.

1384
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,995
- Really?
- Yes, really.

1385
01:23:20,079 --> 01:23:22,540
She's paying for it.
Let's give her what she wants.

1386
01:23:22,623 --> 01:23:24,125
I'm going home.

1387
01:23:41,892 --> 01:23:43,728
(Philippa) I can't bear it.

1388
01:23:46,981 --> 01:23:48,607
I'm going for a walk.

1389
01:24:29,482 --> 01:24:31,025
Fancy a brew, Jo?

1390
01:24:35,154 --> 01:24:36,655
Hello, Jo?

1391
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:49,084
(Sighs)

1392
01:24:52,296 --> 01:24:54,757
(Horse snorts)

1393
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:56,592
(Phone buzzes)

1394
01:25:00,930 --> 01:25:02,765
(Gasps)

1395
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:07,311
(Horse whinnies)

1396
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:11,357
(Gasps)

1397
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:25,746
Wait.

1398
01:25:33,671 --> 01:25:34,755
Wait!

1399
01:26:22,094 --> 01:26:24,263
(Breathes heavily)

1400
01:26:50,164 --> 01:26:52,541
There's a wound to the skull.

1401
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:54,293
It's not visible
from the surface,

1402
01:26:54,376 --> 01:26:57,046
but when you turn it over,
you can see a slicing blow

1403
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:59,173
that has taken
some skull with it.

1404
01:26:59,256 --> 01:27:01,300
It would have killed him
almost instantly.

1405
01:27:01,383 --> 01:27:03,802
"Killed the boar,
shaved his head."

1406
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:05,512
That's a Welsh poet's
description

1407
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:08,140
of the death of Richard
from the 15th century.

1408
01:27:08,849 --> 01:27:10,976
Richard's personal emblem
was a boar.

1409
01:27:12,102 --> 01:27:15,105
It's the body of an adult male,

1410
01:27:15,189 --> 01:27:18,275
aged somewhere between
20 and 40.

1411
01:27:18,359 --> 01:27:19,985
Richard was 32.

1412
01:27:20,069 --> 01:27:22,112
(Jo) But there's something else.

1413
01:27:24,531 --> 01:27:27,076
I've just been excavating
the spinal column,

1414
01:27:27,159 --> 01:27:31,914
and if you look at it
along here, it's unmistakable.

1415
01:27:32,831 --> 01:27:35,751
There's an abnormal curvature.

1416
01:27:38,921 --> 01:27:40,089
Hello.

1417
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:47,012
(Jo) These remains
are those of a hunchback.

1418
01:27:51,809 --> 01:27:54,269
Tudor apologists
will have a field day.

1419
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,316
It doesn't matter.

1420
01:28:02,778 --> 01:28:04,113
He's perfect.

1421
01:28:48,574 --> 01:28:50,451
(Woman) They're calling you
from the dig.

1422
01:28:51,410 --> 01:28:53,162
They're saying to tell you...

1423
01:28:54,705 --> 01:28:57,458
Trauma to the skull
and a curved spine.

1424
01:28:59,376 --> 01:29:01,295
(Dog barks)

1425
01:29:04,923 --> 01:29:06,592
(Tyres screech)

1426
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:15,684
Of course, it's not certain
that this is Richard.

1427
01:29:15,768 --> 01:29:18,729
There are still DNA tests
and so forth to be carried out.

1428
01:29:18,812 --> 01:29:22,232
But I'm struck peering down
at the mortal remains

1429
01:29:22,316 --> 01:29:25,778
that this is a person,
a father, a brother, a son.

1430
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:27,821
Philippa, could we
have a word with you?

1431
01:29:27,905 --> 01:29:29,698
- Yes, of course. Erm...
- (Phone rings)

1432
01:29:29,782 --> 01:29:32,826
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.
Hold on, erm...

1433
01:29:33,911 --> 01:29:35,954
I've really got to take this.
I'm sorry, John.

1434
01:29:36,038 --> 01:29:37,247
Anything to add, sir?

1435
01:29:37,331 --> 01:29:39,041
It's a testimony
to the research...

1436
01:29:39,124 --> 01:29:40,626
- John?
- Hey.

1437
01:29:40,709 --> 01:29:43,253
I just wondered how everything
was going.

1438
01:29:43,337 --> 01:29:45,339
John, you're not
gonna believe this.

1439
01:29:45,422 --> 01:29:47,800
Where the hell is Buckley?

1440
01:29:51,553 --> 01:29:52,763
Found him.

1441
01:29:54,223 --> 01:29:55,849
(Crowd noise on video game)

1442
01:29:56,850 --> 01:29:58,769
- Boys. Boys! Boys.
- What are you doing?

1443
01:29:58,852 --> 01:30:01,605
Your mum, your mother's
just found Richard III.

1444
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:04,566
- Kingfinder!
- Yeah!

1445
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,026
(Boys cheer)

1446
01:30:06,110 --> 01:30:07,861
(Max) Yes, mum!
I knew you could do it!

1447
01:30:07,945 --> 01:30:09,488
(Raife) Well done, mum!

1448
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:10,948
Listen, I've got to go.

1449
01:30:11,031 --> 01:30:13,408
- I love you lots, all of you.
- (Max) Love you too.

1450
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,369
Very much.

1451
01:30:18,205 --> 01:30:19,748
He's here. He's here.

1452
01:30:25,462 --> 01:30:28,632
- Where were you?
- I was... busy.

1453
01:30:28,715 --> 01:30:30,050
Is it definitely him?

1454
01:30:30,134 --> 01:30:31,969
Well, I don't think
there's any doubt.

1455
01:30:32,052 --> 01:30:34,638
You've bloody missed it all.
We're playing catch-up now.

1456
01:30:34,721 --> 01:30:36,557
Vice chancellor's here.
Vice chancellor.

1457
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,016
- Could you just...?
- Oh, yeah.

1458
01:30:38,100 --> 01:30:39,560
What do you mean, "we"?

1459
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:42,187
The university
withdrew my funding.

1460
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:44,648
It's a very fluid situation.

1461
01:30:44,731 --> 01:30:47,192
- Mr burgess.
- Things can change very rapidly.

1462
01:30:47,276 --> 01:30:49,111
Are changing very rapidly.

1463
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:53,115
Will change. Mr burgess.

1464
01:30:53,198 --> 01:30:55,450
Philippa!
I just can't believe it!

1465
01:30:55,534 --> 01:30:58,704
He was right where
I said he'd be, in trench one.

1466
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,747
- You went with your feelings?
- I did.

1467
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:02,833
Oh, god!

1468
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,459
Thank you!

1469
01:31:04,543 --> 01:31:05,752
Who's that?

1470
01:31:05,836 --> 01:31:07,462
(Sighs)
Right, that's Bob burgess.

1471
01:31:07,546 --> 01:31:08,797
He's the vice chancellor.

1472
01:31:08,881 --> 01:31:11,300
The university have got their
big guns here double quick.

1473
01:31:11,383 --> 01:31:12,467
That's nice.

1474
01:31:12,551 --> 01:31:14,970
Archaeology department,
the university of Leicester.

1475
01:31:15,053 --> 01:31:16,805
Look, you have no idea
the impact

1476
01:31:16,889 --> 01:31:18,932
that this is gonna
have on the city!

1477
01:31:19,016 --> 01:31:21,685
How he famously promised
his kingdom for a horse.

1478
01:31:21,768 --> 01:31:24,521
But what happened to
the body of king Richard III

1479
01:31:24,605 --> 01:31:26,315
after his defeat at
the battle of bosworth

1480
01:31:26,398 --> 01:31:28,567
has remained a mystery
for more than 500 years.

1481
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:30,527
Until now. Maybe.

1482
01:31:30,611 --> 01:31:33,488
(Speaks Russian)

1483
01:31:33,572 --> 01:31:36,116
(Speaks Italian)

1484
01:31:36,575 --> 01:31:38,744
They believe they've uncovered
the remains

1485
01:31:38,827 --> 01:31:40,370
of long-lost royalty.

1486
01:31:40,454 --> 01:31:42,956
He happens to be
king Richard III.

1487
01:31:54,468 --> 01:31:58,430
- Richard. Hi.
- Philippa. Hi. Excited?

1488
01:31:58,513 --> 01:31:59,556
Nervous.

1489
01:31:59,640 --> 01:32:01,975
So how's it gonna work today?
Who says what?

1490
01:32:02,059 --> 01:32:05,187
Leicester uni have a whole
running order worked out.

1491
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,356
- Did they not consult you?
- No.

1492
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:10,025
So who's chairing it?

1493
01:32:12,486 --> 01:32:14,112
- What?
- We'd better get inside.

1494
01:32:22,454 --> 01:32:25,916
(Taylor) Having received the
results of the DNA analysis,

1495
01:32:25,999 --> 01:32:28,460
I now call upon Richard Buckley,

1496
01:32:28,543 --> 01:32:31,088
the lead archaeologist
of this project,

1497
01:32:31,171 --> 01:32:34,841
to deliver today's
astonishing announcement

1498
01:32:34,925 --> 01:32:38,428
from the university
of Leicester. Thank you.

1499
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:41,640
(Clears throat)

1500
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:45,936
The glare of worldwide publicity
has not detracted in any way

1501
01:32:46,019 --> 01:32:49,564
from our intent and purpose
to conduct world-class research

1502
01:32:49,648 --> 01:32:50,983
on our discovery,

1503
01:32:51,066 --> 01:32:54,528
which is a hallmark
of the university of Leicester.

1504
01:32:56,363 --> 01:32:58,073
Ladies and gentlemen,

1505
01:32:58,156 --> 01:33:01,660
it is the academic conclusion
of the university of Leicester

1506
01:33:01,743 --> 01:33:04,079
that beyond reasonable doubt,

1507
01:33:04,162 --> 01:33:06,623
the individual exhumed
at greyfriars

1508
01:33:06,707 --> 01:33:09,501
on the 5th of September 2012...

1509
01:33:10,836 --> 01:33:14,923
Is indeed king Richard III,
son of York,

1510
01:33:15,007 --> 01:33:17,634
the last plantagenet king
of england.

1511
01:33:17,718 --> 01:33:19,720
(Cheering)

1512
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:38,113
Well done. Well done.

1513
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:41,074
Philippa should have
been up on that podium with us.

1514
01:33:41,158 --> 01:33:44,286
Don't go off-piste.
The world's press is here.

1515
01:33:44,369 --> 01:33:47,456
It's about putting you and the
university front and centre.

1516
01:33:47,539 --> 01:33:50,000
At least I've got the good grace
to feel guilty.

1517
01:33:50,083 --> 01:33:51,084
(Taylor) Now, now.

1518
01:33:53,295 --> 01:33:56,381
(Sighs) Must dash.

1519
01:34:03,513 --> 01:34:06,850
Philippa. How are you?
Sorry about the, er, seating.

1520
01:34:06,933 --> 01:34:08,643
You haven't responded
to my emails.

1521
01:34:08,727 --> 01:34:10,145
What's happening
with the burial?

1522
01:34:10,228 --> 01:34:12,647
Oh, the tomb?
Have you seen the design?

1523
01:34:12,731 --> 01:34:14,858
Very striking. I'll get them
to email it to you.

1524
01:34:14,941 --> 01:34:17,402
It needs to have
a royal coat of arms on it.

1525
01:34:17,486 --> 01:34:18,528
That's very important.

1526
01:34:18,612 --> 01:34:20,655
It's a proper acknowledgement
of who he was.

1527
01:34:20,739 --> 01:34:22,032
- A sign of respect.
- Yeah.

1528
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:24,493
I think this was discussed
by the burial committee,

1529
01:34:24,576 --> 01:34:26,787
and they didn't think
that a coat of arms

1530
01:34:26,870 --> 01:34:29,706
- is the correct protocol here.
- Sorry, why not?

1531
01:34:29,790 --> 01:34:31,875
The committee felt that
the physical evidence

1532
01:34:31,958 --> 01:34:33,960
gathered from the dig, the...

1533
01:34:34,044 --> 01:34:36,213
Hunch spine and so on,

1534
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:38,382
does tend to support
the historical view

1535
01:34:38,465 --> 01:34:40,675
that Richard was a usurper.

1536
01:34:40,759 --> 01:34:43,512
Richard. Benedict cumberbatch
has agreed to do a reading

1537
01:34:43,595 --> 01:34:46,014
- at the re-internment!
- Oh, that is...

1538
01:34:46,098 --> 01:34:47,474
- That's a goal!
- (Both laugh)

1539
01:34:47,557 --> 01:34:49,226
Benedict cumberbatch.

1540
01:34:50,394 --> 01:34:52,104
Tell Tom I'll be there
in a minute.

1541
01:34:52,187 --> 01:34:53,313
Yeah.

1542
01:34:55,023 --> 01:34:56,441
I was tied up all yesterday

1543
01:34:56,525 --> 01:34:58,193
on what to put
on the souvenir bars

1544
01:34:58,276 --> 01:35:00,362
of the Richard III chocolate.

1545
01:35:00,445 --> 01:35:03,782
Be shot glasses
and bookmarks tomorrow.

1546
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:07,744
Welcome to my world. Ok.

1547
01:35:14,251 --> 01:35:17,963
- He was not a usurper.
- (Taylor sighs)

1548
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:20,298
And the diagnosis was scoliosis,

1549
01:35:20,382 --> 01:35:23,093
curvature of the spine.
Not a hunchback.

1550
01:35:23,176 --> 01:35:26,054
Well, the committee felt
that the condition,

1551
01:35:26,138 --> 01:35:29,683
or whatever its precise label,
does suggest

1552
01:35:29,766 --> 01:35:30,851
that there is more truth

1553
01:35:30,934 --> 01:35:33,019
to Shakespeare's account
of Richard's life

1554
01:35:33,103 --> 01:35:36,481
than perhaps you
and your supporters

1555
01:35:36,565 --> 01:35:37,899
would like to admit to.

1556
01:35:42,362 --> 01:35:46,658
So twisted spine equals
twisted personality, does it?

1557
01:35:48,034 --> 01:35:50,287
No, no, no. (Chuckles)

1558
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,664
That's not what the committee
is saying.

1559
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:55,834
It's... it's...
Let's just calm down.

1560
01:35:55,917 --> 01:35:58,253
He was a legitimate king.

1561
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:02,007
And his right to a royal coat
of arms on his tomb

1562
01:36:02,090 --> 01:36:03,884
is unarguable.

1563
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:06,928
I will fight you
all the way on this, Richard.

1564
01:36:09,723 --> 01:36:11,224
Well, the decision of the burial

1565
01:36:11,308 --> 01:36:14,060
rests with the holder
of the exhumation licence,

1566
01:36:14,144 --> 01:36:18,023
which through Richard Buckley,
is the university of Leicester.

1567
01:36:19,024 --> 01:36:20,484
I thought you fired him.

1568
01:36:20,567 --> 01:36:22,819
We reinstated him.

1569
01:36:22,903 --> 01:36:25,322
And we've awarded him
a doctorate.

1570
01:36:25,405 --> 01:36:27,032
(Philippa)
When did that happen?

1571
01:36:27,115 --> 01:36:28,867
Quite recently.

1572
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,247
I specified a royal coat of arms

1573
01:36:34,331 --> 01:36:37,125
as a condition of his reburial.

1574
01:36:37,209 --> 01:36:39,127
But Richard Buckley
didn't include it

1575
01:36:39,211 --> 01:36:40,670
on the exhumation licence.

1576
01:36:40,754 --> 01:36:43,215
Well, that is unfortunate...

1577
01:36:44,341 --> 01:36:45,926
For you.

1578
01:36:50,972 --> 01:36:52,307
Sorry.

1579
01:37:00,190 --> 01:37:01,942
(Girl) Excuse me.

1580
01:37:03,026 --> 01:37:04,486
Are you Philippa?

1581
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:06,905
Yes.

1582
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:08,823
Would you come and give a talk
to our school

1583
01:37:08,907 --> 01:37:10,700
about finding Richard III,
please?

1584
01:37:11,618 --> 01:37:13,787
Oh, that's very flattering.

1585
01:37:13,870 --> 01:37:15,455
What made you come and ask me?

1586
01:37:15,539 --> 01:37:17,207
That man over there.

1587
01:37:17,290 --> 01:37:19,960
He told us that you
were the one to talk to.

1588
01:37:21,336 --> 01:37:22,712
Did he?

1589
01:37:27,133 --> 01:37:29,553
Well, I'm sure
we can arrange something.

1590
01:37:55,912 --> 01:37:58,164
(Horse neighs)

1591
01:38:16,891 --> 01:38:19,436
All I ever wanted
was to find you...

1592
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:23,815
And show everyone you
were always the rightful king.

1593
01:38:27,986 --> 01:38:30,196
But they're taking you
away from me again.

1594
01:38:30,280 --> 01:38:32,991
Why don't you say
what you came here to say?

1595
01:38:36,953 --> 01:38:39,122
I don't want to let you go.

1596
01:38:39,205 --> 01:38:40,832
You know the truth.

1597
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:43,835
Nothing else matters.

1598
01:38:47,172 --> 01:38:48,590
Goodbye.

1599
01:38:53,386 --> 01:38:54,804
Thank you, Philippa.

1600
01:38:55,930 --> 01:38:57,390
You're welcome.

1601
01:39:56,491 --> 01:39:59,285
(Choir sings)

1602
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:43,747
Hmm. I'm surprised
to see him here.

1603
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:46,583
He must've joined the fan club.

1604
01:40:46,666 --> 01:40:48,209
(Chuckles)

1605
01:40:56,843 --> 01:40:58,762
- Philippa.
- Oh, hi.

1606
01:40:59,929 --> 01:41:01,431
It's dr Buckley now, is it?

1607
01:41:01,514 --> 01:41:03,016
Oh, no, that's just for,
you know,

1608
01:41:03,099 --> 01:41:05,393
business cards and stuff.
Silly.

1609
01:41:05,477 --> 01:41:07,228
Are you going to
the big banquet later?

1610
01:41:07,312 --> 01:41:10,857
I made sure you got an invite.
I've gotta go and change.

1611
01:41:10,940 --> 01:41:13,735
I'll save you a place at the
top table. I'll see you later.

1612
01:41:19,491 --> 01:41:20,617
(Girl) Where's mummy?

1613
01:41:20,700 --> 01:41:22,952
- (Man) I don't know, bubba.
- Richard?

1614
01:41:24,496 --> 01:41:28,416
Erm... no, I'm... I'm Pete.
Have we met?

1615
01:41:30,585 --> 01:41:32,086
I'm so sorry, it's my mistake.

1616
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:34,005
- You're an actor, aren't you?
- Yes.

1617
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:36,090
I saw you play Richard
in Edinburgh.

1618
01:41:36,174 --> 01:41:38,510
Oh, right. Yeah, well,
we thought we'd come down

1619
01:41:38,593 --> 01:41:40,386
- and see him off.
- Right.

1620
01:41:40,470 --> 01:41:43,139
I have to say,
you played him beautifully.

1621
01:41:43,223 --> 01:41:44,307
(Pete) Oh.

1622
01:41:44,390 --> 01:41:46,226
Your performance,
it really, erm...

1623
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:50,104
Stayed with me.

1624
01:41:50,772 --> 01:41:53,024
Thank you very much.
That's... thanks.

1625
01:41:53,107 --> 01:41:54,317
(Girl) Where's mummy gone?

1626
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:57,320
Erm, I think we better go
and find mummy.

1627
01:41:57,403 --> 01:41:58,947
Er, very nice to meet you.

1628
01:41:59,030 --> 01:42:00,824
- Philippa.
- Philippa.

1629
01:42:00,907 --> 01:42:02,158
- Say bye.
- Bye!

1630
01:42:02,242 --> 01:42:03,535
- Bye, love!
- Have a nice day!

1631
01:42:03,618 --> 01:42:04,953
You too.

1632
01:42:29,185 --> 01:42:30,353
(Both chuckle)

1633
01:42:49,289 --> 01:42:51,499
(Applause)

1634
01:43:08,766 --> 01:43:12,520
Hello.
My name is Philippa Langley.

1635
01:43:12,604 --> 01:43:14,397
And I'm here today
to tell you a story

1636
01:43:14,480 --> 01:43:18,943
about a person
who was judged unfairly in life

1637
01:43:19,027 --> 01:43:23,364
and never given the opportunity
to show their true potential.

1638
01:44:04,405 --> 01:44:05,907
Thank you.
