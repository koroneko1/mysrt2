1
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,000
How long have we been walking this road?

2
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:55,666
Has it been fifty years already?

3
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,458
And you've never said a word.

4
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:05,958
Sorry, miss.

5
00:04:06,041 --> 00:04:07,500
I've gotten old.

6
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,416
What have you brought today?

7
00:04:16,833 --> 00:04:17,833
A bunch of old wire.

8
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,458
Don't worry about the cops.

9
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,500
Nobody's seen the old lady in a few weeks.

10
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,500
In a moment,
they'll drag a corpse out of there.

11
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,416
Wait and see. We'll get a good show.

12
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,500
Is this from a motorbike?
That's my grandpa's era.

13
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:38,375
I've only seen them in photos
taken back in the day.

14
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,583
Let's do it like this.

15
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,708
For all this, I'll give you… 400,000.

16
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:48,666
I can strip the copper from the wire,
but the rest has gone to shit. Okay?

17
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,458
I'll take it, 400,000.

18
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,125
Good. Not a haggler.

19
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,333
Less of a headache.

20
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:07,250
Damn. Vintage.

21
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:09,416
You've got the old government issue chip?

22
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,166
Fucking ancient.

23
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,375
Ancient technology, ancient man.

24
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,666
Nobody's used
that shit for a thousand years.

25
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:18,583
Did it even go through?

26
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:21,208
Yeah, all right.

27
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:22,958
Go on. Get out of here.

28
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,708
You'll be safe here.

29
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,250
And you won't be alone.

30
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,333
Mom! Whose graves are these?

31
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:29,083
I don't know. They probably belonged to
a family that lived here a long time ago.

32
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,250
I don't think spirits are lingering here.

33
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:33,916
Their souls must have
moved on a long time ago.

34
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,750
I like coming here.

35
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,000
It's peaceful.

36
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,500
Come help me up.

37
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,458
Help me with these.

38
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,375
That will do. You better get home.

39
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,583
Your father will want you
back sooner than later.

40
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,750
Go home before he gets angry.

41
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,041
Go on.

42
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,958
Please don't leave me alone here.

43
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,458
All the farm work I do
and it's barely enough to eat.

44
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,791
I sent the boy home to help you.

45
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,291
Where were you all day, boy?

46
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,500
He can't hardly do anything yet.

47
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:06,000
In the end,
I just have to do everything myself.

48
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,250
I've grown as much as I can.

49
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:11,791
And we can't rely on
the little bit you sell.

50
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:17,250
There's a foreign company
in town offering help to farmers.

51
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,500
What kind of help?

52
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:10,916
How much are these?

53
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:13,250
Two for 5,000.

54
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,708
Too expensive. Can you give me a deal?

55
00:14:16,791 --> 00:14:18,000
I really can't…

56
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,625
How about three for 5,000?

57
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,833
I can't make any profit
at three for 5,000.

58
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:24,125
Your vegetables are wilted.

59
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:25,458
Just sell them at cost.

60
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,916
I lose money at that price.

61
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:29,666
I'll only pay three for 5,000.

62
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,416
Please add some extra for me.

63
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,166
Hello.

64
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,750
Can we talk, brother?

65
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,000
Is this your mother?

66
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:52,958
No.

67
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:57,958
Was she your wife?

68
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:01,125
Here's the deal.

69
00:15:01,791 --> 00:15:04,750
The woman that runs
the noodle shop went missing.

70
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:07,666
Nobody knows where she is.

71
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,875
We contacted her daughter in Vientiane.

72
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,208
And why are you here?

73
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,166
Didn't she have a damn microchip?

74
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,625
Isn't that how you usually find people?

75
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,958
We found her microchip inside her shop.

76
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:23,291
EVIDENCE

77
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:25,208
That woman.

78
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,250
She had dementia.
She's wandered off before.

79
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,833
She disappears for three
or four days at a time.

80
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:33,708
Don't worry. She'll come back on her own.

81
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,958
We know that she's dead.

82
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,583
She was all on her own.

83
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,708
Somebody needed to help her.

84
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,750
She could hardly feed herself.

85
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,166
She was skinny as a cat.

86
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:06,250
She couldn't even run her little shop,
much less take care of herself.

87
00:16:07,875 --> 00:16:09,875
And her daughter? Where was she?

88
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,541
Why wasn't she here to help?

89
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:17,166
We want you to take us to the body.

90
00:16:21,125 --> 00:16:23,583
Everybody in the village
has heard about you,

91
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,916
that you can talk with spirits.

92
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:30,208
If you could contact her
spirit and ask her

93
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,250
where her body is…

94
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:36,500
No.

95
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,375
We just want to recover her body
before her daughter comes back.

96
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,375
If you could help us…

97
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,708
I can't help you.

98
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:22,500
Here.

99
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,333
Do you see?

100
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,500
You're all right now.

101
00:19:57,791 --> 00:19:59,000
Are you working or what?

102
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,416
When I was your age,
I'd have finished the whole row by now.

103
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,708
Are you going to work today?
Or are you just going to daydream?

104
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,500
Go on. Get out of here.

105
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,916
Check if your mother sold anything.

106
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,250
Enough that we can eat tonight.

107
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,541
Perfect. You came right on time.
I'm getting ready to go home.

108
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,875
Come on. Help me pack up.

109
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,625
Hey! Slow down!

110
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,416
You'll destroy the vegetables.

111
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,291
What's wrong?

112
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,541
I haven't seen you sleep in weeks.

113
00:20:56,333 --> 00:20:57,541
Is something the matter?

114
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:09,625
That's my mother.

115
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:14,875
I remember
when you first started following me.

116
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,291
It was before she got sick.

117
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:27,000
When I was a boy…
was there an old man sitting behind you?

118
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,083
And what happened to him?

119
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,291
Did he ask you that, too?

120
00:21:57,958 --> 00:22:02,375
If you'd sold this bike to me all at once,
I'd have given you a million kip.

121
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:03,583
Piece by piece…

122
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,708
I've probably paid you twice that by now.

123
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:10,125
Come on. Try to find something
I can sell to the tourists.

124
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:11,375
I don't want this shit.

125
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,541
If your mother wandered off
and disappeared into the jungle,

126
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:23,291
her chances of survival would be low.

127
00:22:58,083 --> 00:22:59,458
Let's go.

128
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:18,250
Fine. Then stay.

129
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,875
Why are you still here?

130
00:25:13,666 --> 00:25:14,958
Thank you.

131
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,500
We can walk together if you want.

132
00:25:27,541 --> 00:25:28,708
Where are you from?

133
00:25:31,083 --> 00:25:32,291
Can't you talk?

134
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:36,166
It's all right.

135
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,833
I don't like talking much either, I guess.

136
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,458
There's my mom.

137
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:48,000
Come on, I'll introduce you to her.

138
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,333
It's okay.

139
00:25:53,916 --> 00:25:54,916
Come on.

140
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:00,000
I'll get you a beer.

141
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:19,916
The cops told me that they asked you
to contact my mother's spirit.

142
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,291
Is that something you do?

143
00:27:27,791 --> 00:27:28,791
No.

144
00:27:31,541 --> 00:27:34,250
When I was growing up,
my mom used to tell me

145
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
that people would see you walking
down the road with ghosts.

146
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,708
I just want to ask her a question.

147
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,750
They don't answer questions.

148
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:47,958
I need to tell her that I'm sorry.

149
00:27:52,833 --> 00:27:54,125
How much do I owe you?

150
00:27:54,208 --> 00:27:55,583
Nothing. There's no charge.

151
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,625
I don't really know how to run this place.

152
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:02,291
And the lease ends next week.

153
00:28:02,375 --> 00:28:05,666
I just need to get rid of what's left
before I go back to the capital.

154
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,625
When I was a boy

155
00:28:13,708 --> 00:28:16,291
my father left us
and went to work in the capital.

156
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,666
My mother was terminally ill.

157
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:20,375
Her lungs filled up
and she drowned in her own blood.

158
00:28:20,791 --> 00:28:22,500
She died right in front of my eyes.

159
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:23,875
I was there with her.

160
00:28:27,833 --> 00:28:31,708
Do you think that feeling sorry
changes anything for your dead mother?

161
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,291
I could pay you.

162
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,333
Who are you?

163
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:08,500
What are you doing in my house?

164
00:30:09,375 --> 00:30:10,541
Leave it there!

165
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,291
Were you eating our food?

166
00:30:12,916 --> 00:30:14,000
I'm sorry, brother.

167
00:30:14,458 --> 00:30:15,666
I'm in the wrong house.

168
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,125
-What's happening?
-Stay inside!

169
00:30:17,208 --> 00:30:19,041
Lock the door. Don't come out.

170
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:21,250
What are you staring at?

171
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,375
Get the hell out!

172
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,916
If I catch you here again…

173
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,541
I'll drag you to the village chief.

174
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,708
I'm warning you.
Next time, I'll call the authorities.

175
00:31:34,291 --> 00:31:37,041
I thought we knew everybody here,
at least their faces.

176
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:40,166
But I didn't recognize
that old guy at all.

177
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:43,625
I shouldn't have chased
him with the machete, the old bastard.

178
00:31:43,708 --> 00:31:45,500
He seemed more confused than anything.

179
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,750
He was probably just hungry, right?

180
00:31:50,458 --> 00:31:51,666
Yeah. You're right.

181
00:31:53,291 --> 00:31:55,291
Oh! There's a piece missing.

182
00:31:55,375 --> 00:31:56,625
Hold it together, okay?

183
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,833
Careful! Be careful!

184
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,000
It's just the fumes from the glue.

185
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,416
Put the kettle on for your mom.

186
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:28,125
Hello?

187
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,708
He's asking if it's okay to look around.

188
00:32:35,875 --> 00:32:36,916
Yeah, okay.

189
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,791
There's more land behind the house

190
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:41,333
with good soil for crops.
It's a lot of space.

191
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,958
Something like two hectares.

192
00:32:44,041 --> 00:32:45,708
It's good land. Beautiful land.

193
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:46,875
Everything grows well.

194
00:32:46,958 --> 00:32:48,750
But I don't have the right equipment--

195
00:32:48,833 --> 00:32:51,208
Don't worry. They know what they're doing.

196
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:53,666
Yeah, okay.

197
00:32:59,166 --> 00:33:03,708
They'll be back to install your
solar panels sometime next week, okay?

198
00:33:05,875 --> 00:33:07,000
Solar panels?

199
00:33:07,083 --> 00:33:08,083
Yeah.

200
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,750
But we don't need electricity.

201
00:33:14,166 --> 00:33:16,333
These instructions are
for you to read, brother.

202
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,208
I really just need a tractor.

203
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,083
Well, our organization doesn't
really do that.

204
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,958
He asked if you understood everything?

205
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,458
Hello!

206
00:33:59,833 --> 00:34:02,375
Sorry for the mess. I'm moving out.

207
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,000
You said you'd pay me.

208
00:34:04,916 --> 00:34:05,916
Of course.

209
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,750
Not the microchip. I want cash.

210
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,083
I need a pen and paper.

211
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:29,833
And something personal
that belonged to her.

212
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,750
She wore this for ten years,

213
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,916
before I bought her a new one.

214
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,583
This comb still has some
of her hair in it.

215
00:35:00,375 --> 00:35:01,375
This will do.

216
00:35:08,166 --> 00:35:09,708
You needed a pen, right?

217
00:35:14,833 --> 00:35:15,875
Is she here?

218
00:35:16,541 --> 00:35:17,541
Who?

219
00:35:20,208 --> 00:35:21,458
My mother.

220
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:25,666
The lights never flicker like that.

221
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,375
She didn't die here, did she?

222
00:35:29,458 --> 00:35:30,916
No. I don't think so.

223
00:35:36,666 --> 00:35:38,291
Will I be able to see her?

224
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,500
It doesn't work like that.

225
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:43,666
But I'll be able to talk to her?

226
00:36:01,625 --> 00:36:02,833
Let it be.

227
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:05,291
Don't read it now.

228
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:18,875
That's it?

229
00:36:20,375 --> 00:36:21,625
Did you want more?

230
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,500
Was that not enough
of a show for your money?

231
00:36:52,666 --> 00:36:55,625
"Your mother isn't here."
What does that mean?

232
00:36:58,625 --> 00:36:59,791
Here's your money.

233
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:01,166
Go back to the capital.

234
00:37:02,875 --> 00:37:05,166
What can I do with 400,000 kip?

235
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:19,916
My mother was missing for a month.

236
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,250
I didn't even know she was gone.

237
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:26,583
I quit my job.

238
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,625
I sold everything I owned.

239
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:32,583
Whatever I have left is
packed in a few bags.

240
00:37:32,666 --> 00:37:34,458
I knew my mother was crazy.

241
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
I knew she was wandering off.

242
00:37:38,916 --> 00:37:41,166
I don't even know where to go next.

243
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,458
Your mother died alone.

244
00:37:46,791 --> 00:37:48,791
How would you even know that?

245
00:37:53,208 --> 00:37:54,833
Do you want a cup of tea?

246
00:37:56,083 --> 00:37:57,416
What?

247
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,208
I'm making tea. Come join me.

248
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:07,708
If you need a place to live, stay here.

249
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:54,333
Come on! Don't just stand there.

250
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:59,541
Get down. If my dad sees me,
he'll make me work.

251
00:39:01,958 --> 00:39:04,208
I want to show you something.

252
00:39:08,875 --> 00:39:12,041
You know… my mom was pregnant
once when I was little.

253
00:39:12,125 --> 00:39:13,375
Just like you were.

254
00:39:16,166 --> 00:39:17,708
I saw your suitcase in the jungle.

255
00:39:17,791 --> 00:39:19,958
You packed baby clothes.

256
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,541
I think you ran away from home.

257
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:24,958
My baby sister died in mom's belly.

258
00:39:27,083 --> 00:39:28,583
I guess the baby was too sick.

259
00:39:29,041 --> 00:39:32,166
After the baby died,
my parents never talked about her again.

260
00:39:32,958 --> 00:39:34,166
It doesn't matter.

261
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:35,541
It was a long time ago.

262
00:39:35,625 --> 00:39:36,833
I was really young then.

263
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:42,250
This is my mom's favorite place.

264
00:39:42,958 --> 00:39:44,458
Do you like it?

265
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,583
Don't worry. Nobody comes here.

266
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:50,083
Just me and my mom.

267
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:56,750
This place is nice.

268
00:39:56,833 --> 00:39:58,625
It's sunny, but it's also got shade.

269
00:39:58,708 --> 00:39:59,750
It's peaceful.

270
00:39:59,833 --> 00:40:02,375
I think it would be a good place
to bury your body.

271
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:04,666
What do you think?

272
00:41:39,833 --> 00:41:42,541
That is called lettuce in Lao.

273
00:41:46,208 --> 00:41:48,708
Organic vegetables
Fresh from the garden

274
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:20,000
You have to take me back.

275
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,125
Back to see my mother.

276
00:42:22,208 --> 00:42:23,833
I know you made it happen.

277
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:24,958
Please.

278
00:42:25,541 --> 00:42:26,791
I know it was you.

279
00:42:26,875 --> 00:42:29,875
I need to go back
to take care of something…

280
00:42:30,791 --> 00:42:31,958
Who are you talking to?

281
00:42:41,125 --> 00:42:42,291
Come on. Let's go home.

282
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:06,250
Here, sister…

283
00:44:06,708 --> 00:44:07,833
Let me help you.

284
00:44:07,916 --> 00:44:09,250
Thank you, but I can manage.

285
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:10,375
No worry. I can help.

286
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,625
It's not so heavy.

287
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:12,583
Let me help.

288
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:16,208
I might be old,
but I can still carry a basket.

289
00:44:16,916 --> 00:44:18,125
Thank you.

290
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:22,208
The other night,
I wandered into the wrong house

291
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,458
and I accidentally broke
something of yours.

292
00:44:24,541 --> 00:44:25,958
I wanted to return it to you.

293
00:44:59,916 --> 00:45:01,166
Here. Have some tea.

294
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,125
It's bitter.

295
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:12,000
It's an old family recipe.

296
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:13,666
It's dried wildflowers and honey.

297
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:15,125
It will help your cough.

298
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,125
Thank you.

299
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:27,041
Will you stay and keep me company?

300
00:45:27,625 --> 00:45:29,583
Just until my son comes.

301
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,250
Of course.

302
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,916
I might rest my eyes.

303
00:45:34,750 --> 00:45:37,041
Take a rest.
I'll watch things for you here.

304
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:20,500
I'm sorry if I somehow offended you.

305
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:38,625
It's okay.

306
00:46:40,666 --> 00:46:41,666
I can see her, too.

307
00:46:43,125 --> 00:46:45,208
Perhaps she wanted the two of us to meet.

308
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:50,125
I gave your mother something
to help her sleep.

309
00:46:55,083 --> 00:46:56,583
Are you a doctor?

310
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:57,833
No, I'm not a doctor.

311
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:01,291
But the girl and I can help your mother.

312
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,166
I was there when she died.

313
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,375
Of course, you were.

314
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:06,791
Just like I was there
with her fifty years ago.

315
00:47:09,583 --> 00:47:12,125
Your mother won't get better.
There's no treatment.

316
00:47:12,208 --> 00:47:13,416
How do you know?

317
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,000
Maybe, I don't.

318
00:47:18,125 --> 00:47:21,166
Take the money you have
and buy medicine for your mom.

319
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:23,916
Hide the rest of it from your father.

320
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,958
And if you decide that you need help…

321
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,250
The girl knows where to find me.

322
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:38,041
Let's go.

323
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,583
Who's the girl in the photo
you keep in the cabinet?

324
00:47:55,291 --> 00:47:58,375
I found it in the jungle.
She was pretty, so I kept it.

325
00:48:02,166 --> 00:48:03,625
I think I've seen her before.

326
00:48:04,125 --> 00:48:05,125
No.

327
00:48:05,625 --> 00:48:06,875
You haven't seen her.

328
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:20,541
How long has this been cracked?

329
00:48:20,625 --> 00:48:23,000
Does it matter?

330
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:24,083
It does.

331
00:48:26,958 --> 00:48:29,083
It's always been broken.

332
00:48:51,666 --> 00:48:54,125
Did I tell ever you how my mother died?

333
00:48:55,250 --> 00:48:56,750
You said she was sick.

334
00:48:58,541 --> 00:49:00,041
Did I say how she was sick?

335
00:49:00,125 --> 00:49:03,750
Something with her lungs.
You said she was coughing up blood.

336
00:49:04,375 --> 00:49:05,375
Really?

337
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,708
That's how I said she died?

338
00:49:09,666 --> 00:49:10,833
Don't you remember?

339
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,166
Of course, I remember.

340
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:16,500
But the cabinet's cracked now.
Everything has changed.

341
00:49:20,166 --> 00:49:21,333
What's my name?

342
00:49:23,125 --> 00:49:25,458
Why would I need to know your name?

343
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:31,958
Come on. Get up.

344
00:49:32,041 --> 00:49:33,041
I'm going to bed.

345
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,875
Why is your bag so heavy?

346
00:50:57,958 --> 00:50:59,083
Is it rocks?

347
00:50:59,166 --> 00:51:01,125
You play all day. Just being useless,

348
00:51:01,208 --> 00:51:03,250
while I slave under the hot sun,

349
00:51:03,333 --> 00:51:05,250
and your mother works on the roadside.

350
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:09,208
And you're out collecting
shit in the jungle?

351
00:51:14,416 --> 00:51:17,375
Here. Your mother is staying in bed today.

352
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:19,541
I already packed her basket.

353
00:51:19,625 --> 00:51:21,500
You'll have to go sell in her place.

354
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,750
The old man said…

355
00:51:31,416 --> 00:51:33,000
that you died fifty years ago.

356
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,208
But when I met you,
you were still alive.

357
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,166
If my mom died…

358
00:52:03,291 --> 00:52:04,833
She wouldn't be sick anymore.

359
00:52:12,333 --> 00:52:13,375
Just like you, right?

360
00:52:13,458 --> 00:52:15,041
You died and you're still here.

361
00:52:54,333 --> 00:52:57,458
Careful. Don't mess with their equipment.

362
00:52:58,750 --> 00:53:01,041
They'll be back to check
on it at some point.

363
00:53:03,541 --> 00:53:05,208
We need to keep it nice for them.

364
00:53:31,583 --> 00:53:35,541
We hardly have enough money to eat.

365
00:53:39,166 --> 00:53:41,750
Where will we find more
to pay for this electricity?

366
00:53:55,416 --> 00:53:56,541
Whatever.

367
00:53:56,625 --> 00:53:57,625
At the very least,

368
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:00,833
we'll have enough light
to watch each other

369
00:54:00,916 --> 00:54:04,375
while we starve to death.

370
00:54:28,916 --> 00:54:30,125
Go check on your mother.

371
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:32,416
I'll go see about dinner.

372
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,958
Your father says you worked for me today.

373
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:04,708
Where did you get this, son?

374
00:55:05,333 --> 00:55:06,791
You didn't steal it, did you?

375
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:14,083
I found it inside an old suitcase
out in the jungle.

376
00:55:14,166 --> 00:55:16,916
You just happened to find
a suitcase full of money?

377
00:55:23,875 --> 00:55:25,916
Okay, then. I'll put it some place safe.

378
00:55:48,291 --> 00:55:49,291
You lied to me.

379
00:55:49,791 --> 00:55:52,500
You said you could communicate
with my mother's spirit.

380
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:02,875
I only told you

381
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:06,250
that your mother's spirit
wasn't in your house.

382
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:07,333
Then where is she?

383
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:09,125
Is she here?

384
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:11,250
No.

385
00:56:12,458 --> 00:56:13,750
Where do you go all day?

386
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:19,458
Your house is filled with dried flowers,
and bones from God knows where.

387
00:56:20,208 --> 00:56:21,875
Is this some sort of occult shit?

388
00:56:22,916 --> 00:56:24,083
Or is it witchcraft?

389
00:56:30,333 --> 00:56:31,541
My mother's necklace…

390
00:56:31,625 --> 00:56:34,625
You asked me to talk to your mother.
And I have.

391
00:56:37,708 --> 00:56:38,958
And she gave this to you?

392
00:56:39,458 --> 00:56:41,000
I found her body.

393
00:56:41,083 --> 00:56:42,333
It just took me a while.

394
00:56:42,416 --> 00:56:43,708
It's already late.

395
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:45,541
Her body's a distance away.

396
00:56:45,625 --> 00:56:47,458
I'll take you to her in the morning.

397
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:50,750
Go rest.

398
00:56:55,333 --> 00:56:56,583
Do you want a cup of tea?

399
00:58:16,916 --> 00:58:18,041
When my mother died,

400
00:58:20,041 --> 00:58:22,291
the villagers cremated
her body in the temple.

401
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,750
The monks told me
that my mother had moved on.

402
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:30,333
But moved on to what, I don't know.

403
00:58:31,458 --> 00:58:33,041
Was she reborn?

404
00:58:35,166 --> 00:58:36,958
Whatever happens next for you…

405
00:58:37,750 --> 00:58:38,750
I don't know.

406
00:58:39,791 --> 00:58:40,791
I'm so sorry.

407
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:04,458
Her arm had stitches.

408
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,041
Doesn't that feel strange?

409
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:12,041
She's been out here for three months.

410
00:59:13,375 --> 00:59:15,791
We should let her daughter take the body.

411
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:18,875
She can give her mother a proper
funeral and let her move on.

412
00:59:42,541 --> 00:59:46,083
People don't change when they die.

413
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:49,166
They don't get less crazy
or start thinking clearly.

414
00:59:49,791 --> 00:59:52,291
Your mother couldn't have
answered your questions.

415
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:54,833
Hello?

416
01:00:08,791 --> 01:00:12,458
…and there are other women
that have gone missing.

417
01:00:12,541 --> 01:00:13,625
I looked it up.

418
01:00:14,875 --> 01:00:16,666
Seven years ago, another woman--

419
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,166
Seven years ago? Come on.

420
01:00:18,958 --> 01:00:19,958
I believe him.

421
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:22,541
He found her body.

422
01:00:22,625 --> 01:00:24,625
I'm going back to Vientiane soon.

423
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:27,458
It's all over now.

424
01:00:39,458 --> 01:00:41,625
Is your mother out of bed, dear?

425
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:44,333
Good. We were all a little worried.

426
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:48,416
Your family lives so far out of town.

427
01:00:51,958 --> 01:00:52,958
Here you are, dear.

428
01:00:54,833 --> 01:00:58,458
Especially with that nasty
cough that's been going around.

429
01:00:58,541 --> 01:00:59,833
Take care of yourselves.

430
01:01:00,708 --> 01:01:02,041
Do you need anything else?

431
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,708
The old man said that if I needed help,
you'd take me to him.

432
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,125
I'm not saying I need help.

433
01:01:22,666 --> 01:01:24,500
But why would I need you to take me?

434
01:01:25,083 --> 01:01:26,333
Why couldn't I go myself?

435
01:02:15,500 --> 01:02:17,041
Where the hell have you been?

436
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:18,375
Did you know?

437
01:02:18,458 --> 01:02:22,208
Did you know that your bitch mother
was hiding money from me?

438
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:24,916
Why don't you ever talk?

439
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,000
Are you drunk, Dad?

440
01:02:26,666 --> 01:02:28,666
You little bastard, am I drunk?

441
01:03:10,208 --> 01:03:11,625
I'm so sorry, son…

442
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,625
I didn't hide it well enough.

443
01:04:28,583 --> 01:04:29,583
Come on.

444
01:04:30,666 --> 01:04:32,791
Fill this hole before I throw my back out.

445
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:41,375
Here, help me.

446
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:04,875
You know this place, don't you?

447
01:05:10,666 --> 01:05:11,958
Do you see them out there?

448
01:05:21,458 --> 01:05:22,875
I'm responsible for these souls.

449
01:05:22,958 --> 01:05:25,000
I put them to sleep
and then I wake them here.

450
01:05:25,458 --> 01:05:27,000
They were all sick and in pain.

451
01:05:27,583 --> 01:05:29,375
And I helped them die at peace.

452
01:05:31,291 --> 01:05:32,458
But…

453
01:05:32,541 --> 01:05:33,708
Why don't they move on?

454
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:35,708
No.

455
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,750
They're at peace here.

456
01:05:42,500 --> 01:05:46,000
When our mother dies,
I want you to bury her here.

457
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:51,458
I want to teach you something.

458
01:06:07,916 --> 01:06:09,750
My father never hit me or my mother.

459
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:12,375
And he never broke the cabinet.

460
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:17,083
He found the money in my bag.

461
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:22,041
I explained where I'd found it.

462
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:24,750
He and my mother discussed it

463
01:06:24,833 --> 01:06:26,750
and my father went to work in the city.

464
01:06:29,333 --> 01:06:30,541
And your father?

465
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:31,541
Where did he go?

466
01:06:31,625 --> 01:06:32,916
I just know that he left.

467
01:06:34,083 --> 01:06:35,083
That's different.

468
01:06:35,666 --> 01:06:37,375
Doesn't matter. It still happened.

469
01:06:37,458 --> 01:06:39,208
Our father left us both.

470
01:06:48,166 --> 01:06:50,750
You don't look like you have
the money for medicine.

471
01:06:52,375 --> 01:06:53,375
This tea…

472
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,708
Will help your mother's cough.

473
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:05,916
This medicine,
half of a pill will stop the pain.

474
01:07:06,833 --> 01:07:08,500
A whole pill will make her sleep.

475
01:07:10,958 --> 01:07:13,583
But take absolute care…

476
01:07:13,666 --> 01:07:15,625
No more than two pills a day.

477
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:16,625
Understood?

478
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:20,208
One day, when you're old…

479
01:07:21,541 --> 01:07:25,416
And a boy comes to ask you for help,
you teach him this, as well.

480
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,583
So that he can help his mother.

481
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:29,416
Do you understand?

482
01:07:30,166 --> 01:07:31,208
And what about you?

483
01:07:31,291 --> 01:07:32,291
Who taught you?

484
01:07:44,250 --> 01:07:47,500
I heard voices. You were talking to a boy.

485
01:07:48,583 --> 01:07:50,750
Was the girl
from the photograph there, too?

486
01:07:55,458 --> 01:07:57,125
Why does she visit you?

487
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:01,541
I was there when she died.

488
01:08:18,666 --> 01:08:19,666
Hello, little boy.

489
01:08:24,125 --> 01:08:26,708
I think you might be the boy
I've been looking for.

490
01:08:31,833 --> 01:08:33,416
Sorry… Here, let me show you.

491
01:08:35,208 --> 01:08:38,375
The villagers have seen you walking
with a young woman.

492
01:08:38,458 --> 01:08:41,083
But whenever they get close,
she disappears.

493
01:08:42,416 --> 01:08:43,500
This was my daughter.

494
01:08:45,291 --> 01:08:46,416
Have you seen her?

495
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,708
She ran away from home months ago.

496
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,083
I just want to find her.

497
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:55,583
I want to give her a proper funeral,
so that her spirit can move on.

498
01:09:02,125 --> 01:09:03,333
Please. Can you help us?

499
01:09:08,208 --> 01:09:10,750
That's enough, isn't it?
This is a waste of time.

500
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,458
I didn't know you had a dog.

501
01:09:37,083 --> 01:09:38,083
I'm sorry.

502
01:10:00,375 --> 01:10:01,375
Here, dear.

503
01:10:07,750 --> 01:10:09,333
Is this your mother's ring?

504
01:10:09,416 --> 01:10:12,166
People saw your father leave
for the city on the bus.

505
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,791
If you and your mother need to eat,
just take the rice.

506
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:32,333
We've arrived.

507
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,041
Well, this is it.

508
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,958
It's cool.

509
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:47,458
It's been comfortable enough.

510
01:10:50,125 --> 01:10:52,291
I promised you dinner.
Let me make something.

511
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,125
She told me that you helped her
find her mother's body.

512
01:11:02,125 --> 01:11:03,166
Thank you.

513
01:11:05,666 --> 01:11:08,708
I liked that one shop
where we used to get coffee.

514
01:11:08,791 --> 01:11:09,791
I remember.

515
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:16,375
Give me your hand.

516
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:19,791
Yeah, right there.

517
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:23,291
It vibrates and it's like
the music is inside my head.

518
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:27,833
That's awesome.

519
01:11:29,916 --> 01:11:31,833
They put the chip against the bone.

520
01:11:31,916 --> 01:11:34,750
And it's good surgical work. No scars.

521
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:38,750
I'm going to get my eyes done next.

522
01:11:39,583 --> 01:11:41,041
You should come back with me.

523
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,500
I want to.

524
01:11:44,625 --> 01:11:46,000
I don't have a job anymore.

525
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:49,000
Don't worry… I'll take care of you.

526
01:11:57,666 --> 01:11:59,833
I should probably go. It's late already.

527
01:11:59,916 --> 01:12:00,916
Just stay.

528
01:12:01,833 --> 01:12:03,333
It's late. You can sleep here.

529
01:12:05,166 --> 01:12:07,750
The weather's cool. I'll sleep outside.

530
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:36,625
I guess that if I forgot anything…

531
01:12:37,750 --> 01:12:38,875
You can throw it out.

532
01:12:38,958 --> 01:12:40,458
Or you can try to sell it.

533
01:12:40,541 --> 01:12:43,125
If you want it,
I left dinner for you.

534
01:12:44,291 --> 01:12:45,625
It's not much, but…

535
01:12:46,833 --> 01:12:47,833
Thank you.

536
01:12:51,041 --> 01:12:52,041
Goodbye, Uncle.

537
01:14:04,625 --> 01:14:05,625
I'm thirsty.

538
01:15:01,875 --> 01:15:03,375
How long did the seizure last?

539
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:06,541
Can she still speak?

540
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,958
It scared me that first time.

541
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:13,916
And it scared me every time after that.

542
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:17,125
The seizures will get worse every time.

543
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,708
She'll have difficulty breathing.

544
01:15:22,791 --> 01:15:24,833
She'll be in constant pain.

545
01:15:26,291 --> 01:15:27,666
And then she'll slowly die.

546
01:16:07,666 --> 01:16:09,833
You told me no more than two pills a day.

547
01:16:09,916 --> 01:16:13,083
As you grow up, you're going to
meet people who need our help.

548
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:17,125
People that don't deserve to suffer.

549
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,458
This is how we help them.

550
01:16:20,500 --> 01:16:21,500
Do you understand?

551
01:16:22,500 --> 01:16:23,500
No.

552
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:26,041
You will soon.

553
01:17:00,958 --> 01:17:01,958
Let me help you up.

554
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:09,666
The seizure frightened your boy.

555
01:17:10,625 --> 01:17:12,416
He asked me to come help you.

556
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:18,250
Thank you.

557
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,250
Wake her up.

558
01:18:12,541 --> 01:18:13,541
Mom?

559
01:18:15,041 --> 01:18:16,916
You were supposed to help her.

560
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:35,541
Bury her in the clearing
beside the grave pillars.

561
01:18:36,333 --> 01:18:38,208
She always liked the flowers there.

562
01:18:38,291 --> 01:18:39,666
Don't let them cremate her.

563
01:18:41,333 --> 01:18:42,333
Get out!

564
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:48,291
Get out! Both of you!

565
01:20:03,708 --> 01:20:04,708
Mom?

566
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:06,958
Are you there, mom?

567
01:20:10,166 --> 01:20:11,166
Mom?

568
01:20:12,500 --> 01:20:13,583
Mom?

569
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,000
I'm hungry.

570
01:23:00,416 --> 01:23:02,000
Please. I'm begging you.

571
01:23:31,666 --> 01:23:32,666
Keep up.

572
01:24:03,958 --> 01:24:04,958
You should bathe.

573
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:10,125
Don't you want me to undress for you?

574
01:24:10,666 --> 01:24:11,666
Of course not.

575
01:24:12,458 --> 01:24:15,708
You usually take my clothes
to keep me from running away.

576
01:24:17,083 --> 01:24:18,458
Is that something you do?

577
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:24,291
Once.

578
01:24:26,041 --> 01:24:27,625
Are you going to run off again?

579
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,000
Take a bath.

580
01:24:33,041 --> 01:24:36,125
Come back up when you're done.
I'll find you something to wear.

581
01:26:14,666 --> 01:26:16,250
Does this belong to one of you?

582
01:26:36,916 --> 01:26:38,833
I didn't do this to you.

583
01:26:42,041 --> 01:26:43,666
You're not one of mine.

584
01:27:03,958 --> 01:27:05,208
Hello?

585
01:27:07,625 --> 01:27:10,416
I see you're looking better.

586
01:27:20,916 --> 01:27:23,083
Here. Go put these groceries
in the kitchen.

587
01:27:25,416 --> 01:27:26,416
Go on. Move.

588
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:34,166
How are you? Are you feeling better?

589
01:28:07,958 --> 01:28:09,958
Please don't take her.

590
01:28:38,291 --> 01:28:41,041
If we don't do the proper
ceremony for your mother,

591
01:28:41,125 --> 01:28:43,041
she won't realize that she's passed away.

592
01:28:43,125 --> 01:28:46,291
She needs to see us prepare her body,
so she can accept death.

593
01:28:46,375 --> 01:28:49,166
Tomorrow we'll take her
to the temple for the cremation

594
01:28:49,250 --> 01:28:51,750
so her spirit can be reborn
and she can move on.

595
01:28:51,833 --> 01:28:52,833
Understand?

596
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:54,791
I don't want her to move on.

597
01:28:54,875 --> 01:28:57,625
Darling, don't say things like that.

598
01:28:57,708 --> 01:29:00,541
Put your hands together
and focus on praying, okay?

599
01:29:15,583 --> 01:29:17,166
How did the candle go out?

600
01:29:17,708 --> 01:29:19,666
We don't want her spirit getting lost.

601
01:29:19,750 --> 01:29:21,583
There. Concentrate on your prayers.

602
01:29:47,083 --> 01:29:48,583
Hey, where are you going?

603
01:30:50,541 --> 01:30:52,083
This is where you'll sleep.

604
01:30:52,875 --> 01:30:55,583
Focus on your studies and your new life

605
01:30:55,666 --> 01:30:57,625
until your father comes back for you.

606
01:31:00,375 --> 01:31:02,041
He won't come.

607
01:31:02,125 --> 01:31:04,583
You don't know that.
Have faith that he'll return.

608
01:31:22,333 --> 01:31:23,333
Hello, sister.

609
01:31:24,791 --> 01:31:26,958
I haven't seen you in a while.
Are you well?

610
01:31:28,541 --> 01:31:30,708
I'd like to make
a take away order, please.

611
01:31:35,500 --> 01:31:37,416
Two servings of caramelized pork stew.

612
01:31:56,166 --> 01:31:57,208
Thank you.

613
01:32:09,500 --> 01:32:10,458
No.

614
01:32:10,541 --> 01:32:11,541
No, no.

615
01:32:12,041 --> 01:32:12,958
Cannot.

616
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:14,708
-You can't. No.
-Sister.

617
01:32:14,791 --> 01:32:19,375
-No, no, no. You can't. Cannot.
-It's okay, sister. Calm down.

618
01:32:19,458 --> 01:32:21,541
Just sit down. I have cash.

619
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:30,708
I don't need any change.

620
01:32:37,416 --> 01:32:39,000
Lina.

621
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:40,916
Lina? Where did Lina go?

622
01:32:41,000 --> 01:32:42,000
Where are you, dear?

623
01:32:49,791 --> 01:32:50,791
Why would it be you?

624
01:32:56,541 --> 01:32:58,125
Why did I take you?

625
01:33:04,166 --> 01:33:05,166
Sit down.

626
01:33:05,625 --> 01:33:06,625
Finish eating.

627
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:08,541
I'm not hungry.

628
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,416
Stop that.

629
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:51,541
I'm used to it now.

630
01:33:53,708 --> 01:33:55,500
You have a girlfriend in the city.

631
01:33:55,583 --> 01:33:57,083
That girl with tattooed hands.

632
01:33:59,583 --> 01:34:01,666
I know you don't want to fuck an old man.

633
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:04,041
I'll put your dinner away.

634
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:06,416
You can eat it tomorrow morning.

635
01:34:46,625 --> 01:34:47,875
Mom?

636
01:36:06,125 --> 01:36:07,541
I brought you dinner.

637
01:36:09,333 --> 01:36:11,583
A boy came to the house today.

638
01:36:11,666 --> 01:36:14,125
He talked to me through the door.

639
01:36:14,875 --> 01:36:15,875
Who is he?

640
01:36:16,916 --> 01:36:19,375
He's the reason why you're here.

641
01:36:21,541 --> 01:36:22,541
No.

642
01:36:24,166 --> 01:36:27,666
You're the reason I'm here.

643
01:36:29,958 --> 01:36:34,583
I'm going to fix this.
It will be like you were never here.

644
01:36:35,166 --> 01:36:36,166
For who?

645
01:36:36,250 --> 01:36:37,875
For me or for you?

646
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:37,208
Satu.

647
01:37:45,125 --> 01:37:46,500
Don't walk away from me!

648
01:37:46,583 --> 01:37:47,833
Where are you going?

649
01:37:48,583 --> 01:37:49,583
Come back here!

650
01:41:15,833 --> 01:41:16,833
Did I die?

651
01:41:19,458 --> 01:41:21,958
You told me the dead don't feel pain.

652
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:13,750
There was a girl locked inside your house.

653
01:42:15,041 --> 01:42:16,041
There was.

654
01:42:16,666 --> 01:42:17,791
She left already.

655
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:23,375
She told me that you hurt her.

656
01:42:23,458 --> 01:42:24,625
I didn't hurt her.

657
01:42:25,250 --> 01:42:26,250
Then who did?

658
01:42:29,958 --> 01:42:32,666
My mother died because she was sick.

659
01:42:33,583 --> 01:42:35,625
-But your mother--
-You killed my mother.

660
01:42:37,625 --> 01:42:41,708
I didn't think I could change
things so much.

661
01:42:44,750 --> 01:42:45,750
I was wrong.

662
01:42:47,333 --> 01:42:48,833
I haven't hurt anybody.

663
01:42:51,000 --> 01:42:52,250
Not yet, perhaps.

664
01:42:53,583 --> 01:42:54,583
But you will.

665
01:42:55,416 --> 01:42:56,916
You'll hurt that girl.

666
01:42:58,458 --> 01:42:59,791
And a dozen others.

667
01:43:01,000 --> 01:43:02,666
Why would I do that?

668
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:08,041
I don't know.

669
01:43:09,458 --> 01:43:10,833
You have to help me.

670
01:43:16,958 --> 01:43:18,208
My leg is injured.

671
01:43:19,166 --> 01:43:20,791
I've lost too much blood.

672
01:43:21,375 --> 01:43:22,583
I can barely walk.

673
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:25,041
I can't help you.

674
01:43:27,375 --> 01:43:29,375
I don't want to be like this.

675
01:44:20,666 --> 01:44:25,875
Help!

676
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:50,833
Are they all gone?

677
01:49:07,166 --> 01:49:08,166
In the end…

678
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:12,333
I never helped any of those women.

679
01:49:14,625 --> 01:49:17,666
They suffered more for it.

680
01:49:26,791 --> 01:49:28,708
I watched you grow up.

681
01:49:30,666 --> 01:49:31,666
Grow old.

682
01:49:33,250 --> 01:49:34,416
And then die.

683
01:49:34,916 --> 01:49:37,125
Circling around a thousand times.

684
01:49:38,541 --> 01:49:40,083
And what about the boy?

685
01:49:40,625 --> 01:49:41,833
He only died once.

686
01:50:01,208 --> 01:50:04,625
You held my hand while I was dying.

687
01:50:06,416 --> 01:50:08,250
And I loved you for that.

688
01:50:11,250 --> 01:50:12,250
I did.

689
01:50:15,166 --> 01:50:16,708
But you only helped yourself.

690
01:50:18,541 --> 01:50:20,083
You never helped me.

691
01:50:26,291 --> 01:50:27,291
Back then…

692
01:50:29,041 --> 01:50:32,916
I couldn't have kept you from dying.

693
01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:35,916
But you could have let me move on.

694
01:50:37,791 --> 01:50:38,833
You never did.

695
01:50:57,833 --> 01:50:59,166
Will we be together?

696
01:51:00,708 --> 01:51:03,541
Walking up and down
that road for eternity?

697
01:51:06,750 --> 01:51:08,291
I don't know where you go.

698
01:51:24,250 --> 01:51:25,750
Will you stay with me?

699
01:51:27,125 --> 01:51:28,375
Just until I die.

700
01:51:31,875 --> 01:51:32,875
No.

701
01:52:25,916 --> 01:52:27,750
Hey, lady!
