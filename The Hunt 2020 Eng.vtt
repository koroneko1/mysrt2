-You hired me to consult you.

I'm consulting you.

of that movie you did again?

51:22.253 --> 51:23.732
Tears of the Sun.

51:23.776 --> 51:25.778
That's... I mean, that's
actually what they called it?

51:25.821 --> 51:27.388
Tears of the Sun?

You trained these fuckers?

58:35.599 --> 58:37.644
Yeah.

58:37.688 --> 58:41.082
How much did they pay you?

58:41.126 --> 58:42.910
Nothing.

58:44.477 --> 58:46.653
I owed her a favor.

58:49.221 --> 58:51.049

to put that.

-Hi.

1:01:15.715 --> 1:01:17.151
So, you're aware
Martin's account

1:01:17.195 --> 1:01:18.849
got hacked last week, right?

1:01:18.892 --> 1:01:21.808
I'm the CEO, Paul.
I hear everything.

1:01:21.852 --> 1:01:24.855
And Martin's one of
my closest friends.

1:01:24.898 --> 1:01:27.988
So you know how embarrassing
it was for him.

1:01:28.032 --> 1:01:31.426
All the, uh,
extramarital communiqués.

1:01:31.470 --> 1:01:34.386
I call it sending
his wife's oncologist

1:01:34.429 --> 1:01:35.822
pictures of his cock.

1:01:35.866 --> 1:01:37.868
I mean, there are more than
just the cock pics.

1:01:37.911 --> 1:01:39.826
There were texts and e-mails,

1:01:39.870 --> 1:01:41.959
and he said some
extraordinarily critical things

1:01:42.002 --> 1:01:43.177
about the president.

1:01:43.221 --> 1:01:44.526

Oh, well,

1:01:44.570 --> 1:01:46.311
last I heard,
free speech still exists.

Don't do that. Don't-don't
First Amendment me, please.

1:01:49.270 --> 1:01:52.186
It's not a country.
It's a business.

1:01:52.230 --> 1:01:54.754
A business,
and there are optics.

1:01:54.798 --> 1:01:56.234
You fired Martin?

1:01:56.277 --> 1:01:58.584
No, he realized he had to
take one for the team.

1:01:58.627 --> 1:02:00.586
-The team?
-Yeah, the team.

1:02:00.629 --> 1:02:01.979
We have a team, our team.

Just a sec. Um...

1:02:05.939 --> 1:02:08.202
Do you recall
a text thread you had

in the morning?

1:02:12.598 --> 1:02:16.428
I don't recall a text thread I
had last fucking Tuesday, Paul.

Go... go ahead, Nicole.

1:02:23.740 --> 1:02:25.785

1:02:25.829 --> 1:02:27.874

just did?"
