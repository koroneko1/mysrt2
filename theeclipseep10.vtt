Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.960
We can’t let those students protest outside the school.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.206
If you’re planning on doing something shitty, don’t.

00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:28.743
I want to see for myself if the Suppalo curse is really potent.

00:00:30.092 --> 00:00:31.996
Congratulations, senior.

00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:32.642
Thank you.

00:00:33.646 --> 00:00:35.000
Hey, Akk.

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:40.616
Congratulations on the Suppalo Best Boy Award.

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:42.669
Freaking cool!

00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:48.289
Suppalo means "power of goodness."

00:00:50.415 --> 00:00:51.320
Remember this, Akk.

00:00:52.383 --> 00:00:56.240
Good deeds will always take you to something good.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.428
Yes, senior.

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:02.649
Do you want this award?

00:01:09.847 --> 00:01:10.975
Me?

00:01:11.702 --> 00:01:12.831
Can I even do it?

00:01:14.156 --> 00:01:15.009
You can.

00:01:16.136 --> 00:01:18.840
You are the most deserving candidate

00:01:19.546 --> 00:01:22.273
for the next student prefect club president.

00:01:23.556 --> 00:01:25.492
Just believe in Suppalo's rules.

00:01:27.735 --> 00:01:28.699
And this award

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:30.771
will be yours.

00:01:56.455 --> 00:01:57.167
[10 MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT]

00:01:57.167 --> 00:01:58.200
Are you guys ready?
[10 MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT]

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.820
[10 MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT]

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.481
We are.
[10 MINUTES BEFORE THE INCIDENT]

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.574
Awesome.

00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:08.526
[This time, I hope it can make you stop!]

00:02:08.526 --> 00:02:09.479
Guys.
[This time, I hope it can make you stop!]

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.317
[This time, I hope it can make you stop!]

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:11.396
what?

00:02:11.396 --> 00:02:12.282
[This time, I hope it can make you stop!]

00:02:12.887 --> 00:02:14.887
[Come to the school backyard.]

00:02:17.197 --> 00:02:18.043
Look.

00:02:34.044 --> 00:02:36.044
[Jumnong, Jumnun, Jumnian]

00:02:39.495 --> 00:02:40.854
Put your phones away.

00:02:41.478 --> 00:02:43.200
And don’t make a big deal out of it.

00:02:44.382 --> 00:02:45.548
Suppalo curse.

00:02:46.972 --> 00:02:48.120
Stop recording.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.241
No phones!

00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:50.419
This is an order!

00:02:52.527 --> 00:02:55.767
Student prefects, keep your friends from using phones.

00:02:55.767 --> 00:02:56.750
Yes, ma’am.

00:02:57.376 --> 00:02:59.397
Kan and Wat, take care of everything here.

00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:00.226
I’ll go get a fire extinguisher.

00:03:00.226 --> 00:03:01.276
Yes.

00:03:01.277 --> 00:03:01.964
Guys, no phones.

00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:02.978
Are you guys okay?

00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:05.508
We are, ma’am.

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:07.420
We’re just shocked.

00:03:07.915 --> 00:03:09.370
I’m all right.

00:03:12.564 --> 00:03:14.265
So the Suppalo curse is back?

00:03:15.491 --> 00:03:16.510
I don’t think it is.

00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:17.876
Hey!

00:03:18.091 --> 00:03:19.065
Put it away!

00:03:26.044 --> 00:03:27.467
He did it again?

00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:29.573
I don’t know.

00:03:33.661 --> 00:03:34.344
Akk.

00:03:34.472 --> 00:03:35.169
Akk.

00:03:35.447 --> 00:03:36.257
Look.

00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:45.506
[This time, I hope it can make you stop!!]

00:03:45.506 --> 00:03:46.635
Who is this guy?

00:03:47.894 --> 00:03:54.041
(Attention! Students are prohibited from protesting without school authorization.)

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:56.633
(Everyone, back to class.)

00:03:56.831 --> 00:04:01.695
(No more protesting in the school area is allowed.)

00:04:02.191 --> 00:04:08.018
(Anyone who joins or gets involved with the protest will face decisive measures.)

00:04:12.728 --> 00:04:13.916
Well done, Chadok.

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:19.417
If you succeed, Suppalo will thank you.

00:04:29.364 --> 00:04:29.962
Go.

00:04:29.962 --> 00:04:30.894
The show is over.

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.785
Move your asses back to class.

00:04:37.238 --> 00:04:37.984
Guys.

00:04:38.967 --> 00:04:39.858
Did you see?

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.655
Did you see what happened?

00:04:43.834 --> 00:04:46.219
Will you really let the school do this to us?

00:04:48.088 --> 00:04:48.998
Enough.

00:04:49.353 --> 00:04:51.246
Back to your duty.

00:04:51.361 --> 00:04:52.848
This is my duty.

00:04:53.167 --> 00:04:54.098
That’s right.

00:04:54.418 --> 00:04:58.363
It’s our duty to protect our own rights and safety.

00:04:58.681 --> 00:05:03.480
But what you did caused trouble and fear to your friends. Can’t you see?

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.261
We’re being threatened here.

00:05:05.964 --> 00:05:08.520
Why are you saying we’re causing fear?

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:13.652
Because your disobedience has brought back the Suppalo curse.

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.225
Not true.

00:05:16.891 --> 00:05:17.873
I think

00:05:18.044 --> 00:05:19.062
you guys should stop.

00:05:19.242 --> 00:05:20.640
Please.

00:05:20.797 --> 00:05:21.744
Stubborn.

00:05:22.797 --> 00:05:24.192
You only think about yourselves.

00:05:24.863 --> 00:05:27.640
You don’t consider the peace and wellness of the majority.

00:05:30.096 --> 00:05:31.191
Teacher,

00:05:31.854 --> 00:05:33.550
the kids are scared.

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:34.991
How about we discuss this later?

00:05:37.107 --> 00:05:37.666
Akk.

00:05:39.413 --> 00:05:40.258
Yes, ma’am.

00:05:41.156 --> 00:05:43.636
Guys, we’re done here.

00:05:43.762 --> 00:05:45.142
Back to your class.

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:46.491
Go.

00:05:46.641 --> 00:05:47.889
All of you.

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:48.727
Leave.

00:05:53.768 --> 00:05:55.234
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:05:56.451 --> 00:05:58.109
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:05:58.492 --> 00:06:00.120
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:06:00.811 --> 00:06:03.960
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:04.807
Stop saying that.

00:06:04.807 --> 00:06:09.767
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:06:09.767 --> 00:06:10.426
I said stop!

00:06:10.426 --> 00:06:13.738
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:06:13.738 --> 00:06:14.620
I told you to stop.

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:21.820
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.161
No gathering here!

00:06:28.276 --> 00:06:29.549
Back to your class!

00:06:30.638 --> 00:06:32.702
What about the burn of our puppet?

00:06:32.881 --> 00:06:35.040
Why did someone want to do this?

00:06:35.112 --> 00:06:38.200
The school will set up a team for investigation.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.459
What?

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.396
Investigation again?

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:44.200
Will the result be just an accident again?

00:06:45.927 --> 00:06:46.779
Don’t worry.

00:06:47.762 --> 00:06:50.000
Suppalo always provides justice to everyone.

00:06:58.852 --> 00:07:00.000
You’re hiding out here.

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:06.080
What’s happening? Should I go check?

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.620
Hey.

00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:08.540
No.

00:07:08.945 --> 00:07:09.898
Sit back down.

00:07:17.179 --> 00:07:18.179
Are you okay?

00:07:18.991 --> 00:07:19.820
Are you all right?

00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:26.576
What happened today has shaken me.

00:07:28.361 --> 00:07:31.537
Whatever I used to uphold or believe in

00:07:36.001 --> 00:07:38.215
has changed.

00:08:07.736 --> 00:08:08.241
Here.

00:08:28.272 --> 00:08:29.425
Just like that day.

00:08:31.571 --> 00:08:32.352
What day?

00:08:33.891 --> 00:08:34.533
Well…

00:08:35.447 --> 00:08:36.827
The second semester of the ninth grade.

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.566
My mom called in to inform me of my dad’s death.

00:08:43.241 --> 00:08:45.000
The teacher told you to bring me the news.

00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:47.288
I was shocked just like today.

00:08:48.064 --> 00:08:49.765
You were comforting me like this as well.

00:08:50.621 --> 00:08:52.044
That was so long ago.

00:08:55.001 --> 00:08:56.809
You got through it before.

00:08:57.769 --> 00:09:00.774
About your stepdad, about school,

00:09:01.982 --> 00:09:03.319
you will get through it too.

00:09:09.785 --> 00:09:11.055
When you’re being sweet,

00:09:11.996 --> 00:09:13.816
you’re kind of warm like a microwave.

00:09:19.539 --> 00:09:20.940
Just like my mysterious friend.

00:09:23.590 --> 00:09:25.200
That Bruce Wayne guy?

00:09:26.782 --> 00:09:27.483
Yes.

00:09:31.942 --> 00:09:33.707
Can you keep a secret?

00:09:35.759 --> 00:09:36.485
I can.

00:09:41.117 --> 00:09:42.305
Maybe…

00:09:42.838 --> 00:09:45.880
I think of him as more than a friend.

00:09:47.695 --> 00:09:48.791
Do you think that’s wrong?

00:09:51.933 --> 00:09:52.837
No.

00:09:53.824 --> 00:09:55.824
Having a good feeling for someone isn’t wrong.

00:10:00.536 --> 00:10:01.510
You’re right.

00:10:03.984 --> 00:10:05.984
I just want to see him in person for once.

00:10:06.373 --> 00:10:07.903
Want to know who he is.

00:10:19.807 --> 00:10:24.116
Will you tell me now how you feel about me?

00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:45.487
You did a very nice job this afternoon.

00:10:46.173 --> 00:10:46.875
What?

00:10:48.522 --> 00:10:51.559
I hope it can stop them.

00:10:52.957 --> 00:10:55.280
Then we will finally have peace.

00:11:08.013 --> 00:11:08.797
What’s up?

00:11:09.402 --> 00:11:10.396
What’s up with you?

00:11:11.459 --> 00:11:13.923
You said we’d do the report after you’re done with your meeting.

00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:16.758
Shit.

00:11:18.028 --> 00:11:19.271
I totally forgot.

00:11:19.684 --> 00:11:20.556
It’s fine.

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:21.684
I finished it.

00:11:22.436 --> 00:11:23.407
I’m sorry.

00:11:25.343 --> 00:11:26.559
I didn’t help.

00:11:27.170 --> 00:11:30.420
Words alone are enough to compensate.

00:11:32.147 --> 00:11:33.784
You must treat me to a dessert.

00:11:37.118 --> 00:11:39.602
This cafe serves better drinks than the last one.

00:11:40.323 --> 00:11:41.044
Yeah?

00:11:41.286 --> 00:11:41.794
Yeah.

00:11:44.585 --> 00:11:45.222
Aye.

00:11:47.259 --> 00:11:48.904
Has that intervener done anything again?

00:11:51.744 --> 00:11:52.479
No.

00:11:55.161 --> 00:11:55.982
Are you scared?

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:00.449
I don’t know.

00:12:03.582 --> 00:12:05.098
Ever since he stepped in,

00:12:06.759 --> 00:12:08.678
everything has been so complicated.

00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:14.415
I used to think things were easier to control.

00:12:17.239 --> 00:12:18.856
The world is changing every day.

00:12:19.841 --> 00:12:23.495
Who are you to control everything?

00:12:25.098 --> 00:12:26.559
Mes could do it.

00:12:29.303 --> 00:12:31.464
The former president of the prefect club?

00:12:32.396 --> 00:12:33.559
Your idol?

00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:42.711
His time and your time are different.

00:12:44.828 --> 00:12:45.577
Right?

00:12:47.077 --> 00:12:47.928
I don’t know.

00:12:53.057 --> 00:12:55.279
Aye, don’t lie down. Your shirt will be dirty.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.733
Dirt can be washed off.

00:12:57.345 --> 00:12:58.400
How about you join me?

00:12:59.186 --> 00:13:00.131
It feels good.

00:13:00.796 --> 00:13:01.559
No.

00:13:01.674 --> 00:13:02.229
Come on.

00:13:02.229 --> 00:13:03.089
Try it.

00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:05.845
Do it.

00:13:16.709 --> 00:13:18.790
Why is growing up so tough?

00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.781
Sometimes, I just don’t want tomorrow to come.

00:13:37.115 --> 00:13:38.752
Until tomorrow comes,

00:13:43.659 --> 00:13:44.852
let me hold your hand like this.

00:13:52.195 --> 00:13:53.113
Tonight,

00:13:55.432 --> 00:13:56.413
I will stay with you.

00:14:11.703 --> 00:14:12.298
Can’t sleep?

00:14:13.286 --> 00:14:14.076
Yeah.

00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:33.492
What are you doing?

00:14:34.471 --> 00:14:35.511
Music for sleeping.

00:14:36.559 --> 00:14:39.475
When I have trouble sleeping, I always listen to this music.

00:14:56.431 --> 00:14:58.088
If you want to look at me, just look.

00:14:59.132 --> 00:15:02.765
Don’t sneak or you might see my bad angle.

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.831
You don’t have to be a narcissist 24/7.

00:15:08.038 --> 00:15:08.825
Take a break.

00:15:08.825 --> 00:15:09.675
It’s tiring.

00:15:13.690 --> 00:15:14.599
You know what?

00:15:16.186 --> 00:15:18.831
I used to be an introvert.

00:15:19.809 --> 00:15:21.809
I liked my peace and quiet.

00:15:23.407 --> 00:15:24.903
But after I met you,

00:15:29.064 --> 00:15:30.903
I got used to being yelled at by you.

00:15:33.772 --> 00:15:35.207
I don’t like to yell at you.

00:15:35.850 --> 00:15:37.366
You just always do something that deserves to be yelled at.

00:15:38.616 --> 00:15:39.429
Exactly.

00:15:41.123 --> 00:15:42.794
I don’t get myself either

00:15:44.414 --> 00:15:47.725
why I like to act that way when I’m with you.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.900
Because you like to bug me.

00:15:53.126 --> 00:15:54.521
I don’t like to bug you.

00:16:01.061 --> 00:16:01.941
I like you.

00:16:07.386 --> 00:16:08.345
There.

00:16:08.834 --> 00:16:10.519
You just always avoid eye contact.

00:16:12.172 --> 00:16:13.768
I’m not avoiding eye contact.

00:16:15.288 --> 00:16:19.547
I will set up a CCTV here so that you can see yourself.

00:16:21.483 --> 00:16:22.392
Time to sleep.

00:16:22.392 --> 00:16:23.322
We need to get up early.

00:16:24.094 --> 00:16:25.146
We’ve got school.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:31.772
Akk.

00:16:33.264 --> 00:16:34.158
What now?

00:16:35.088 --> 00:16:39.326
Will you tell me now how you feel about me?

00:16:48.567 --> 00:16:49.324
I…

00:16:53.196 --> 00:16:54.439
I get you.

00:16:57.173 --> 00:16:58.629
When I first found out,

00:17:01.802 --> 00:17:02.935
it was difficult too.

00:17:08.911 --> 00:17:10.588
You can’t like a bad person like me.

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:16.559
You know all the bad things I’ve done.

00:17:16.841 --> 00:17:17.542
And…

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.495
That’s my answer.

00:17:39.719 --> 00:17:42.304
That day when I told my mom we were dating,

00:17:45.675 --> 00:17:47.433
I meant it.

00:17:50.342 --> 00:17:50.973
Akk,

00:17:53.877 --> 00:17:55.004
should we get together?

00:17:58.935 --> 00:18:00.209
Don’t be ridiculous.

00:18:01.305 --> 00:18:02.619
I’m a guy.

00:18:03.264 --> 00:18:04.699
And I’m going to sleep.

00:18:14.511 --> 00:18:15.643
What are you doing?

00:18:15.966 --> 00:18:17.197
Don’t run away.

00:18:18.809 --> 00:18:20.040
Answer me.

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:25.629
Akk.

00:18:28.326 --> 00:18:29.277
Should we get together?

00:18:35.414 --> 00:18:37.132
I can do this all night.

00:18:40.722 --> 00:18:41.393
Akk.

00:18:44.903 --> 00:18:45.667
Yes.

00:18:46.474 --> 00:18:47.125
Fine.

00:18:50.294 --> 00:18:51.003
What?

00:18:52.798 --> 00:18:54.008
Say it clearly.

00:18:55.470 --> 00:18:56.420
Should we get together?

00:19:00.897 --> 00:19:01.947
Will you be my boyfriend?

00:19:02.930 --> 00:19:05.319
I don’t know. I will sleep now.

00:19:18.159 --> 00:19:19.433
Good night, boyfriend.

00:19:24.024 --> 00:19:24.717
Sleep.

00:19:25.725 --> 00:19:26.559
Go to sleep.

00:19:27.451 --> 00:19:28.342
I’m going to sleep.

00:19:37.830 --> 00:19:39.286
Aye!

00:19:42.501 --> 00:19:43.628
What the heck are you doing?

00:19:44.051 --> 00:19:44.924
Kiss my cheek.

00:19:45.716 --> 00:19:47.716
Don’t let me be the only one who kisses.

00:19:48.666 --> 00:19:49.799
Or that would mean you’re my wife.

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.506
I’ve got no news of any protest at the moment, sir.

00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:04.853
At least these kids know how to listen.

00:20:06.073 --> 00:20:07.463
Keep an eye on them, still.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:08.908
Any movement at all,

00:20:09.605 --> 00:20:10.720
inform me immediately.

00:20:24.901 --> 00:20:26.134
What the heck are you doing?

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:27.908
We’re in school.

00:20:30.637 --> 00:20:31.874
Well, I missed you.

00:20:32.705 --> 00:20:34.073
Missed, my ass.

00:20:34.409 --> 00:20:35.215
We were just together.

00:20:36.065 --> 00:20:37.259
Didn’t you miss me at all?

00:20:40.894 --> 00:20:42.545
I did! Happy now?

00:20:43.113 --> 00:20:44.114
Let go.

00:20:45.042 --> 00:20:46.203
I’m making rounds.

00:20:46.354 --> 00:20:47.956
Kan and Wat will be here soon.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.180
Kiss my cheek first.

00:20:53.534 --> 00:20:54.424
Please.

00:20:54.424 --> 00:20:55.754
Give me a cheek kiss.

00:20:57.547 --> 00:20:59.809
I want a good moment this morning.

00:21:06.427 --> 00:21:08.056
Moment, my foot!

00:21:08.056 --> 00:21:08.802
No.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.354
Kiss me.

00:21:18.049 --> 00:21:20.311
Don’t let me be the only one who kisses.

00:21:21.296 --> 00:21:22.300
Or that would mean you’re my wife.

00:21:24.981 --> 00:21:25.715
Come on.

00:21:33.973 --> 00:21:35.058
I’m not your wife.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.914
You’re my wife.

00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.332
That’s ticklish.

00:21:41.917 --> 00:21:43.307
I like it when you say something like this.

00:21:44.151 --> 00:21:45.737
You taught me to.

00:21:46.384 --> 00:21:47.796
I’m always the one to blame.

00:21:49.097 --> 00:21:49.954
Go already.

00:21:49.954 --> 00:21:50.819
One more time.

00:21:52.122 --> 00:21:53.425
Aye, go.

00:21:53.425 --> 00:21:54.237
One more kiss.

00:21:54.237 --> 00:21:55.181
Aye.

00:21:55.377 --> 00:21:56.182
Akk.

00:21:58.913 --> 00:22:00.477
What are you two doing?

00:22:04.787 --> 00:22:06.351
Aye was on his phone.

00:22:06.616 --> 00:22:09.074
I brought him here to lecture him about the school rules.

00:22:09.784 --> 00:22:10.439
Right?

00:22:11.485 --> 00:22:12.263
Right.

00:22:17.942 --> 00:22:19.434
Don’t do this again.

00:22:19.984 --> 00:22:21.831
If I catch you using it, I will take it.

00:22:23.159 --> 00:22:23.843
Got it?

00:22:25.608 --> 00:22:26.314
Yes, sir.

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:28.820
Just leave already.

00:22:36.697 --> 00:22:37.738
Rules are rules, right?

00:22:38.115 --> 00:22:39.853
You’re fidgeting somehow.

00:22:41.379 --> 00:22:42.282
I’m not.

00:22:47.702 --> 00:22:48.372
Oh.

00:22:48.634 --> 00:22:52.234
You call him Aye now?

00:22:53.411 --> 00:22:54.600
I’m narrowing the gap.

00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:55.912
Teacher Sani’s advice.

00:22:59.094 --> 00:23:00.514
Keep on making rounds.

00:23:03.369 --> 00:23:04.123
Come on.

00:23:09.709 --> 00:23:10.554
Narrowing the gap, he said.

00:23:14.513 --> 00:23:15.310
Guys.

00:23:15.746 --> 00:23:16.448
Hm?

00:23:17.045 --> 00:23:20.636
Do you think school feels weird today?

00:23:21.628 --> 00:23:22.822
The protesters aren’t here.

00:23:23.927 --> 00:23:24.881
That’s why it’s quiet.

00:23:26.641 --> 00:23:28.154
Doesn’t seem like them at all.

00:23:31.469 --> 00:23:33.469
Do you think they're preparing to protest outside school?

00:23:34.115 --> 00:23:34.990
Possibly.

00:23:35.971 --> 00:23:40.409
They can’t protest inside the school so they do it outside instead.

00:23:41.833 --> 00:23:42.518
True.

00:23:42.605 --> 00:23:44.051
They will not stop this easily.

00:23:50.701 --> 00:23:53.486
[See you at the protest, Bruce Wayne. I’ll be waiting.]

00:23:53.486 --> 00:23:54.525
What is it, Kan?

00:23:56.947 --> 00:23:58.838
Nothing. It’s my family.

00:23:59.235 --> 00:24:00.211
I’m going to call my mom.

00:24:09.169 --> 00:24:10.010
Thua.

00:24:13.562 --> 00:24:14.198
Yeah?

00:24:15.973 --> 00:24:16.753
Come here.

00:24:17.488 --> 00:24:18.987
Kan, where are you taking me?

00:24:23.122 --> 00:24:25.623
Kan, why did you take me here?

00:24:26.102 --> 00:24:27.250
Are you going to join the protest?

00:24:28.102 --> 00:24:28.845
Yes.

00:24:29.068 --> 00:24:30.228
I signed up for it.

00:24:31.972 --> 00:24:32.921
I’m not letting you go.

00:24:34.243 --> 00:24:34.993
Why not?

00:24:35.342 --> 00:24:36.897
I asked Bruce Wayne to meet me there.

00:24:37.577 --> 00:24:40.427
You’re head of the class.

00:24:40.674 --> 00:24:41.845
You can't do this.

00:24:42.674 --> 00:24:45.954
Plus, I don't want you to be cursed like those guys.

00:24:50.033 --> 00:24:50.768
Let’s do this.

00:24:51.924 --> 00:24:56.022
Shoot the ball into the basket and I’ll let you go.

00:25:01.081 --> 00:25:03.495
You know I can’t.

00:25:03.754 --> 00:25:04.695
It’s not fair.

00:25:06.373 --> 00:25:07.432
’ll teach you then.

00:25:08.615 --> 00:25:09.406
Fair enough?

00:25:14.194 --> 00:25:15.316
Elbows up.

00:25:17.339 --> 00:25:18.460
Left hand holds it right here.

00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:21.235
Set it up straight.

00:25:23.098 --> 00:25:24.074
Can you see the basket?

00:25:25.970 --> 00:25:26.994
I can.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:30.820
When you see it, get down just a little.

00:25:54.067 --> 00:25:54.999
I think you can shoot now.

00:26:03.163 --> 00:26:05.969
And now you have no right to stop me.

00:26:34.038 --> 00:26:34.910
Hello.

00:26:36.152 --> 00:26:37.280
No school today.

00:26:37.546 --> 00:26:38.768
Why did you call so early?

00:26:39.771 --> 00:26:40.898
I wanted to see your face.

00:26:41.989 --> 00:26:42.842
Why?

00:26:43.801 --> 00:26:44.434
Nothing.

00:26:46.072 --> 00:26:47.104
Seriously, why?

00:26:49.981 --> 00:26:53.913
Do you need to go get the names of those who are joining the protest?

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.326
I’m a student prefect after all.

00:26:59.323 --> 00:27:00.865
But it’s a day off.

00:27:02.124 --> 00:27:04.434
You don’t have to be a prefect all the time.

00:27:05.582 --> 00:27:06.393
No.

00:27:06.807 --> 00:27:07.822
I can’t do that.

00:27:08.813 --> 00:27:09.746
You can.

00:27:10.813 --> 00:27:13.340
Akk, I know you don't want to go.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.282
Should we just run away?

00:27:16.544 --> 00:27:17.762
To where?

00:27:18.504 --> 00:27:19.259
Just agree.

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:20.482
I’ll pick you up.

00:27:21.334 --> 00:27:22.658
Don’t. I’m not going with you.

00:27:33.416 --> 00:27:34.434
Guys.

00:27:34.778 --> 00:27:39.960
School should be a place where we can express our opinions.

00:27:41.549 --> 00:27:43.549
Where we can learn to be ourselves.

00:27:45.146 --> 00:27:47.408
Not a place that restricts our rights and liberties.

00:27:48.263 --> 00:27:49.366
Right?

00:27:49.824 --> 00:27:50.612
Right.

00:27:52.098 --> 00:27:55.624
School should be a safe place.

00:27:55.875 --> 00:27:58.114
A place where we can learn to be ourselves.

00:27:58.114 --> 00:27:59.410
Is that right, everyone?

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:00.543
Right!

00:28:00.543 --> 00:28:06.174
Suppalo uses the tale to scare us.

00:28:06.774 --> 00:28:08.425
We’re scared to think.

00:28:09.327 --> 00:28:11.153
To question.

00:28:11.670 --> 00:28:15.740
They use the curse tale to frighten us.

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.512
Too afraid to think.
[#suppalo]

00:28:17.834 --> 00:28:19.434
Too afraid to have different opinions.
[The tale of the old generation is troubling people in the new generation. #suppalo]

00:28:19.675 --> 00:28:21.043

[#suppalo is trending no.1 with 211k tweets.]

00:28:28.912 --> 00:28:32.263
People who run away together don’t get on social media.

00:28:32.263 --> 00:28:33.066
Hm?

00:28:42.499 --> 00:28:44.848
You ran away with me or I ran away with you exactly?

00:28:47.418 --> 00:28:48.699
You dragged me here.

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.844
It’s called kidnapping.

00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:52.335
It’s a day off.

00:28:54.910 --> 00:29:00.419
Suppalo uses the curse tale to scare us.

00:29:01.754 --> 00:29:05.672
[Bruce Wayne, I’m at the protest. Where are you?]

00:29:05.814 --> 00:29:10.124
When we’re not afraid to think or raise questions,

00:29:11.097 --> 00:29:13.097
they accuse us of not loving the school,

00:29:23.425 --> 00:29:25.708
not being proud to be Suppalo students.

00:29:27.541 --> 00:29:28.645
Right?

00:29:29.541 --> 00:29:30.437
Right.

00:29:30.848 --> 00:29:32.121
Did I keep you waiting?

00:29:33.603 --> 00:29:34.434
Kan?

00:29:37.563 --> 00:29:39.192
You can call me Kan Kanlong

00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.714
or Bruce Wayne.

00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.053
Will your student prefect title be affected coming here?

00:29:54.428 --> 00:29:55.458
Screw it.

00:29:57.634 --> 00:29:59.171
Not just me who’s at risk.

00:30:00.695 --> 00:30:02.154
You too, head of the class.

00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:08.297
You’re right.

00:30:10.673 --> 00:30:11.517
Right!

00:30:12.809 --> 00:30:14.526
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:30:14.691 --> 00:30:16.604
Find the one responsible.

00:30:16.946 --> 00:30:18.594
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:30:18.701 --> 00:30:20.418
Find the one responsible.

00:30:20.739 --> 00:30:22.586
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:30:22.586 --> 00:30:24.295
Find the one responsible.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.095
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:30:26.095 --> 00:30:27.723
Find the one responsible.

00:30:27.876 --> 00:30:29.532
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:30:29.532 --> 00:30:31.133
Find the one responsible.

00:30:31.133 --> 00:30:32.740
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:34.524
Find the one responsible.

00:30:34.762 --> 00:30:35.453
Thua.

00:30:35.845 --> 00:30:39.072
Are you disappointed I’m Bruce Wayne?

00:30:41.404 --> 00:30:42.348
I like you.

00:30:59.867 --> 00:31:00.620
Thua.

00:31:08.718 --> 00:31:12.121
Are you disappointed I’m Bruce Wayne?

00:31:18.037 --> 00:31:19.217
Why would I be?

00:31:21.872 --> 00:31:23.139
I’m glad it’s you.

00:31:28.702 --> 00:31:31.596
Last night, I barely got any sleep.

00:31:32.489 --> 00:31:33.884
I talked to myself all night.

00:31:35.789 --> 00:31:37.526
I’ve got so many decisions to make.

00:31:41.212 --> 00:31:42.357
And here I am.

00:31:44.697 --> 00:31:45.552
I know.

00:31:46.847 --> 00:31:50.687
Even if you didn’t show up, I still needed to thank you.

00:31:53.149 --> 00:31:55.149
For being Bruce Wayne.

00:31:56.439 --> 00:32:01.699
And for being you who always take care of me.

00:32:11.076 --> 00:32:12.103
I like you.

00:32:24.964 --> 00:32:26.754
I’ve never been like this before.

00:32:30.814 --> 00:32:35.193
Do you want to be with someone who says one thing but means another?

00:32:36.245 --> 00:32:39.151
Someone who is not very nice?

00:32:48.297 --> 00:32:49.745
I’ve got something to ask.

00:32:51.007 --> 00:32:51.834
What?

00:32:58.072 --> 00:32:59.204
That night, at Akk’s house,

00:33:02.155 --> 00:33:03.682
did you mean to…

00:33:11.737 --> 00:33:13.001
kiss me?

00:33:21.479 --> 00:33:22.401
Um.

00:33:23.910 --> 00:33:25.200
I meant to kiss you.

00:33:26.456 --> 00:33:31.164
I’m sorry I pretended nothing happened after that.

00:33:31.791 --> 00:33:33.239
You must have been very angry.

00:33:41.236 --> 00:33:42.122
Then yes.

00:33:44.068 --> 00:33:44.866
Huh?

00:33:46.181 --> 00:33:47.052
What?

00:33:50.651 --> 00:33:52.099
I will be with you.

00:33:53.994 --> 00:33:54.860
Seriously?

00:33:56.464 --> 00:33:57.440
Yes.

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:00.300
I’m not saying it again. I’m shy.

00:34:36.181 --> 00:34:43.623
(Stop the Suppalo curse.)
(Find the one responsible.)

00:34:48.610 --> 00:34:49.708
Did you join the protest?

00:34:51.154 --> 00:34:52.056
Um.

00:34:53.067 --> 00:34:54.278
Be careful.

00:34:55.052 --> 00:34:58.472
I heard the Student Welfare Department is collecting names of students joining.

00:34:59.722 --> 00:35:00.579
Really?

00:35:00.579 --> 00:35:01.538
Yes.

00:35:09.852 --> 00:35:11.721
Turn those videos off.

00:35:12.521 --> 00:35:13.837
Class.

00:35:14.882 --> 00:35:16.882
Good morning.

00:35:18.214 --> 00:35:19.688
You are students.

00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.490
Don’t take interest in that nonsense.

00:35:22.635 --> 00:35:24.635
Your duty is to study.

00:35:25.492 --> 00:35:30.305
The path Suppalo plans for you has been well considered.

00:35:30.914 --> 00:35:31.987
Understood?

00:35:32.914 --> 00:35:34.262
Yes, ma’am.

00:35:35.414 --> 00:35:37.361
Take out the papers from last week.

00:35:43.026 --> 00:35:43.843
Akk.

00:35:45.184 --> 00:35:45.901
Yes.

00:35:46.563 --> 00:35:49.746
You must improve your performance as a student prefect.

00:35:50.481 --> 00:35:53.506
We all agreed in the teachers' meeting that

00:35:53.816 --> 00:35:57.052
since we've had prefects,

00:35:57.168 --> 00:36:03.480
this year's prefects have performed the poorest of all in terms of controlling the school situations.

00:36:12.896 --> 00:36:13.765
Yes, ma’am.

00:36:15.684 --> 00:36:17.367
I’ll try harder.

00:36:17.747 --> 00:36:22.823
Don’t let down the one who chose you for the president title.

00:36:26.811 --> 00:36:27.575
Yes.

00:36:29.557 --> 00:36:30.777
Where is Wittawat?

00:36:31.093 --> 00:36:32.373
He’s on leave.

00:36:33.671 --> 00:36:34.698
Going where?

00:36:35.537 --> 00:36:37.011
He didn’t say.

00:36:37.011 --> 00:36:38.703
He just informed me he’d be on leave.

00:36:40.168 --> 00:36:42.720
Keep an eye on your friends’ leaves.

00:36:44.131 --> 00:36:45.263
What is this?

00:36:45.818 --> 00:36:48.423
These are all the names you got?

00:36:54.453 --> 00:36:55.875
I’m trying to look into it, sir.

00:36:59.094 --> 00:37:00.831
I might need some time.

00:37:01.105 --> 00:37:02.816
We don’t have that much time, Akk.

00:37:03.626 --> 00:37:06.257
The school foundation day is coming up in a few days.

00:37:06.888 --> 00:37:10.781
The alumni club and all the parents will be here.

00:37:11.345 --> 00:37:14.397
If we can’t handle this, what should say to them?

00:37:19.855 --> 00:37:21.618
You’re a student prefect.

00:37:22.350 --> 00:37:24.350
Perform your duty like you deserve that armband.

00:37:34.495 --> 00:37:35.417
What?

00:37:41.417 --> 00:37:43.417
I’ve got something to talk to you about.

00:37:43.417 --> 00:37:44.246
It can wait.

00:37:45.112 --> 00:37:46.744
I have an urgent business to attend to.

00:38:13.712 --> 00:38:14.749
Sir.

00:38:15.537 --> 00:38:16.263
What?

00:38:17.135 --> 00:38:19.451
You’ve got to stop putting pressure on Akk.

00:38:20.240 --> 00:38:21.327
What are you talking about?

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:26.537
You must have used this method to kill many people.

00:38:29.275 --> 00:38:32.169
If you don’t know things, you better not speak.

00:38:33.359 --> 00:38:34.649
Back to your class.

00:38:38.026 --> 00:38:38.872
Teacher.

00:38:38.872 --> 00:38:39.500
Ayan!

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.691
Come back and talk to me.

00:38:40.691 --> 00:38:41.408
Ayan.

00:38:41.708 --> 00:38:42.788
Stop.

00:38:42.788 --> 00:38:45.017
School isn’t over yet. You can’t leave.

00:38:45.236 --> 00:38:46.069
Ayan.

00:38:46.647 --> 00:38:47.814
- Teacher!
- Ayan!

00:38:48.574 --> 00:38:49.522
Stop.

00:38:50.354 --> 00:38:52.932
School isn’t over yet. You can’t leave.

00:38:59.926 --> 00:39:02.031
How can Teacher Chadok leave then?

00:39:04.199 --> 00:39:06.436
Teacher Chadok gave advanced notice of his leave.

00:39:07.078 --> 00:39:09.078
We have enough troubles here in this school.

00:39:09.577 --> 00:39:12.077
I don’t want any more trouble.

00:39:15.141 --> 00:39:16.720
Back to your class for now.

00:39:17.074 --> 00:39:19.311
Whatever it is, we can talk in a nice manner.

00:39:26.593 --> 00:39:28.356
Do you really not see

00:39:29.424 --> 00:39:32.292
that your attempt at compromise is

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:36.484
encouraging the bad system to continue?

00:39:38.431 --> 00:39:42.298
The shitty system that kills many people.

00:40:45.838 --> 00:40:48.285
Your school freaking sucks.

00:41:01.610 --> 00:41:03.084
I’m worried about you, Akk.

00:41:17.705 --> 00:41:19.810
Don’t let anything happen to you.

00:41:21.031 --> 00:41:22.821
Do not leave me too.

00:41:27.407 --> 00:41:28.645
I’m okay.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:30.983
What’s the matter?

00:41:35.742 --> 00:41:37.125
I’m worried about you.

00:41:42.418 --> 00:41:44.760
Seeing you like this reminds me of my uncle.

00:41:51.111 --> 00:41:53.111
This school is freaking cold-blooded.

00:41:55.350 --> 00:42:00.663
I got it now why my uncle did it.

00:42:02.607 --> 00:42:03.573
Hold on.

00:42:05.537 --> 00:42:06.676
I’m lost.

00:42:08.873 --> 00:42:10.426
How was your uncle related to this school?

00:42:14.316 --> 00:42:15.264
He was.

00:42:19.904 --> 00:42:21.799
He’s Teacher Dika.

00:42:26.498 --> 00:42:27.788
Hi, Akk.

00:42:29.239 --> 00:42:30.318
Teacher Dika.

00:42:31.843 --> 00:42:32.764
Hello.

00:42:33.617 --> 00:42:34.776
Hello.

00:42:39.733 --> 00:42:40.892
I thought

00:42:42.071 --> 00:42:44.308
he just quit.

00:42:48.566 --> 00:42:50.566
I…

00:43:18.347 --> 00:43:19.400
It’s okay.

00:43:29.885 --> 00:43:31.149
It’s okay.

00:43:48.465 --> 00:43:49.965
When you are lost,

00:43:50.881 --> 00:43:54.511
when you’re worried,

00:43:56.717 --> 00:43:57.928
or anxious,

00:43:58.834 --> 00:44:01.018
my uncle told me to hold on to this necklace.

00:44:02.529 --> 00:44:04.108
I want you to have it.

00:44:07.702 --> 00:44:09.912
Right now you need it more than I do.

00:44:37.811 --> 00:44:38.891
Aye.

00:44:44.733 --> 00:44:46.076
How did he die?

00:44:56.024 --> 00:44:57.603
I’m wondering

00:45:01.533 --> 00:45:04.190
if Teacher Chadok was the reason he died.

00:45:13.201 --> 00:45:17.015
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:21.600
Be with me for as long as you can.

00:45:21.899 --> 00:45:24.215
You guys want to know what we are?

00:45:24.828 --> 00:45:26.048
I’ll show you with this kiss.

00:45:27.337 --> 00:45:29.011
What are you going to do about tomorrow?

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:30.973
I have no clue.

00:45:31.935 --> 00:45:33.357
Can we just skip tomorrow?

00:45:34.078 --> 00:45:35.841
Do you remember this necklace?

00:45:35.841 --> 00:45:37.352
It belonged to my uncle.

00:45:37.539 --> 00:45:39.118
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:45:39.118 --> 00:45:40.993
We should deal with the protest in school first.

00:45:40.993 --> 00:45:42.260
Let’s go see the last boss.
