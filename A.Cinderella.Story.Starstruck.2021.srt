1
00:00:14,057 --> 00:00:15,450
'Why?'

2
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:17,626
'It wasn't over for me!'

3
00:00:17,713 --> 00:00:20,542
'I waited for you
for seven years..'

4
00:00:20,629 --> 00:00:23,719
'...and now it's too late.'

5
00:00:23,806 --> 00:00:27,331
'I wrote you 365 letters.'

6
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:29,464
I wrote you
every single day for a year.

7
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:31,683
You..

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,771
...you wrote me?

9
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:34,121
Yes!

10
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:36,645
I wrote you every single day.

11
00:00:36,732 --> 00:00:38,995
You..

12
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:41,258
It wasn't over for me.

13
00:00:41,345 --> 00:00:43,217
It still isn't over.

14
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:48,352
Yes! Jon Ham, you
are so right!

15
00:00:48,439 --> 00:00:50,398
It is the rain scene
from "The Notebook."

16
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:55,055
Aw, well, thank you.

17
00:00:55,142 --> 00:00:56,578
I am a pretty good actress

18
00:00:56,665 --> 00:00:57,709
but you all

19
00:00:57,796 --> 00:00:59,842
are an excellent audience.

20
00:01:01,539 --> 00:01:03,628
You guys are so sweet.

21
00:01:03,715 --> 00:01:05,500
You're right, it would be

22
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:06,979
amazing to get to perform

23
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,285
in front of a bigger audience

24
00:01:08,372 --> 00:01:10,722
but...I just don't think

25
00:01:10,809 --> 00:01:13,290
that's in the cards for me yet,
boys and girls.

26
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,207
Stop it.

27
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:18,774
You're going to make me blush.

28
00:01:20,123 --> 00:01:21,385
You know, it would be amazing

29
00:01:21,472 --> 00:01:22,778
to be a real actress

30
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:24,562
like in Hollywood, but..

31
00:01:28,262 --> 00:01:30,046
...I just gotta make it
there somehow.

00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:23,915
No. No, there's no
pork in salmon.

95
00:04:24,002 --> 00:04:25,526
It's fish.

You-you said that
you wanted fish.

I-I said I wanted fish
fingers. Fish fingers.

These are not fish fingers.

Oh, my God, Kale!
Quit saying "Fish fingers."

100
00:04:36,058 --> 00:04:37,581
Fish fingers.

Wait. What?

102
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,024

- What?

00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:47,722
- What?
- No way!

00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,724
I mean, there's no freaking..
What?

105
00:04:49,811 --> 00:04:52,335
Oh, my God, stop. What?

106
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,163
- Guess what's coming to town?
- What?

107
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,034
- Guess who is coming to town?
- Who?

108
00:04:56,121 --> 00:04:57,514
I'm gonna do it, I'm gonna do
it, I'm going to punch you

109
00:04:57,601 --> 00:04:59,386

spit it out, Saffron.

could bring in to this little--

Shut up, Kale!

119

Nobody cares about revenue.

120
00:05:20,363 --> 00:05:22,496
You shut up, Saffron!
It's all about revenue.

Can you let her finish?

122
00:05:23,932 --> 00:05:26,064

on a ranch in a town
not unlike Dreary."

131
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:46,258
Okay, like, they're talking
about farms. Nobody cares.

132
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:51,655
"The auditions will be held
at noon tomorrow at the Mill.

134
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:56,356
Obviously and.. Wow!

135
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:01,099
- Mom..
- Oh!

136
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:03,319
- Saffron..
- I'm going to that audition.

137
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,495
- Oh, yes, you are.
- Oh, I am!

138
00:06:05,582 --> 00:06:09,630
- I think I'm going to go, too.
- Oh, you're not an actor.

139
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:11,806
Well, that's fine.
Neither are you.

140
00:06:11,893 --> 00:06:14,635
I'm obviously not going
to audition, Saffron.

141
00:06:14,722 --> 00:06:16,898
I am gonna to be
Jackson Stone's manager.

142
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:18,595
You're not a manager.

143
00:06:18,682 --> 00:06:20,249
Oh, really?

144
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:22,469
Then how would you explain
Wanda's Waffle and Sushi House

145
00:06:22,556 --> 00:06:24,862
blowing it up on the 'Gram?

146
00:06:24,949 --> 00:06:28,170
- That was all me.
- They have, like, 37 followers.

147
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,824
Oh, that's 35 more than you do.

148
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,522
Um..

149
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:33,828
Can I go, too?

150
00:06:34,524 --> 00:06:35,960
Huh?

151
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:37,135
I want to audition.

152
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,573
Mom.

153
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,053
Oh, no. No.

154
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,664
You-you can't go
to the audition.

155
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,753
You have far too many things
to do here around the house.

156
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,407
Please, can't they
help out too? I..

157
00:06:51,672 --> 00:06:53,325
Is it their fault
that your father

158
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,675
had to own a farm

159
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,591
with horses and pigs
that need to be milked--

160
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:00,942
No, no, mom, uh, pigs don't
need to be milked.

161
00:07:01,029 --> 00:07:04,641
Okay, I will wake up
really early tomorrow

162
00:07:04,728 --> 00:07:07,427
and I will do my chores and if
they are not finished in time

163
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,733
I won't go, I promise.

164
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,737
Fine...fine.

165
00:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,305
- Really?
- I'll leave you a list.

166
00:07:16,392 --> 00:07:17,828
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

167
00:07:17,915 --> 00:07:19,134
Oh, and you will also
need to take

168
00:07:19,221 --> 00:07:21,310
that annoying little pig
to the butcher.

169
00:07:21,397 --> 00:07:23,355
Mm-hmm, yes, pork chops.

170
00:07:38,762 --> 00:07:42,200
Ba-boom! And see with that spin,
if we can get that spin..

171
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:45,160
With the, with the tassels
coming up, that's really nice.

172
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:47,336
'Hit me now. Hit me.'

173
00:07:47,423 --> 00:07:48,816
'Yes! That's it!
That's it.'

174
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:51,079
'The studio is gonna love that.'

175
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:54,038
This is looking like money. This
is looking like money all day.

176
00:07:56,214 --> 00:07:57,477
Mm!

177
00:08:09,837 --> 00:08:13,841
Oh, Valerian! I...thought that
everyone was already asleep.

178
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:16,539
We were. What are
you doing in here?

179
00:08:17,409 --> 00:08:19,716
I just, um..

180
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:21,588
You see, it's really
cold tonight

181
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,894
so I thought that maybe I could
sleep on the couch, you know

182
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:25,548
if that's okay.

183
00:08:25,635 --> 00:08:27,594
No, Finley, that's not okay.

184
00:08:27,681 --> 00:08:29,378
This isn't a flop house.

185
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:31,989
You have the largest
bedroom of us all.

186
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,425
It's not really a bedroom.

187
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,515
'Is that not enough for you?'

188
00:08:35,602 --> 00:08:37,734
You have to kick us
out of our living room, too?

189
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,611
It's just...really
cold tonight, that's all.

190
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:47,048
Oh..

191
00:08:47,135 --> 00:08:48,484
Well, take a blanket.

192
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:56,927
Surprise, surprise.
Guess who said no.

193
00:08:58,276 --> 00:09:00,365
Here, it's for you tonight.

194
00:09:00,452 --> 00:09:02,019
You've got to be cold, too.

195
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,760
I know.

196
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,719
I know you told me
she'd say no, I just..

197
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,982
...thought maybe..

198
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:09,984
Okay.

199
00:09:12,203 --> 00:09:13,335
Man!

200
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:17,252
Okay..

201
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:19,994
Cold.

202
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:22,605
Goodnight, boys.

203
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,347
Goodnight, Jon Ham.

204
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:29,569
Goodnight, Dad.

205
00:09:49,371 --> 00:09:51,112
Oh, God.

206
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:59,511
Tsk. Perfect.

00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:44,252
Come here. Who was such a good
helper today?

218
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:45,819
You were!

219
00:10:45,906 --> 00:10:47,298
'Finley!'

220
00:10:57,526 --> 00:10:59,223
- Mom?
- Yeah?

221
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:01,051
Why are you all dressed up?
You're not auditioning.

222
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:04,054
Oh, well, I was thinking
I might, you know?

223
00:11:04,141 --> 00:11:07,623
I mean, I was kind of
a big deal back in my day.

224
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:09,538
Your day was,
like, in the '60s

225
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,584
before they had cars
or iPhones.

226
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:17,067
I was the "It Girl" of 1987.

227
00:11:17,154 --> 00:11:19,156
I was on the cover
of "Glamour Magazine."

228
00:11:19,243 --> 00:11:20,723
No, you weren't.

229
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,246
Back cover.

230
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,292
- Nope.
- Fine.

231
00:11:24,379 --> 00:11:28,122
I was in a print ad
in one of those big magazines.

232
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:32,126
Oh, the hemorrhoid cream ad?

233
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:34,998
You wish you had a
hemorrhoid cream ad, Saffron.

234
00:11:35,085 --> 00:11:38,175
At least mom had a job,
unlike someone I know.

235
00:11:38,262 --> 00:11:39,829
Who, you?

236
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,049
- 'Shut up, Saffron.'
- 'No, you shut up, Kale.'

237
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:44,355
Okay, breakfast is ready.

238
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:48,098
- Here.
- Oh, smells crispy.

239
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:50,492
And, um, I finished up
all of my chores

240
00:11:50,579 --> 00:11:51,972
so, I'm going
to the audition.

241
00:11:52,886 --> 00:11:55,758
- Mom?
- Yeah.

242
00:11:55,845 --> 00:11:59,936
Um, you still need to take
that pig to the butcher.

243
00:12:00,023 --> 00:12:02,069
Right, you know,
I don't really think

244
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,810
that we should put him down,
so why don't we just--

245
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:05,463
'Oh, you don't think so?'

246
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,161
You think we should just
keep hemorrhaging money

247
00:12:07,248 --> 00:12:09,511
for your mangy
little animals, hmm?

248
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:11,556
- They are her only friends.
- It's tragic.

249
00:12:13,036 --> 00:12:16,257
Like, who's she
talking to? The pig?

250
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:20,348
We're gonna sell this dump.

251
00:12:20,435 --> 00:12:23,177
- Yes! Thank you!
- Oh, my God.

252
00:12:23,264 --> 00:12:27,659
Yes! We are gonna sell this dump
and get the hell out of here.

253
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,010
- Yes!
- No, you're not.

254
00:12:30,097 --> 00:12:32,708
- Hey, can we just--
- Oh, yes, I am. I am.

255
00:12:32,795 --> 00:12:35,102
I could sell this house.

256
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,844
Kale, how much can I sell
this house for?

257
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:39,454
Well, obviously, I'd need
like a comparative

258
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,629
market analysis but probably--

259
00:12:40,716 --> 00:12:42,936
You're not selling my house!

260
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:44,720
- Excuse me?
- Mom?

261
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:48,332
Look..

262
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,247
Guys, I was..

263
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,206
...I was born in this house.

264
00:12:52,293 --> 00:12:53,424
Ew!

265
00:12:53,511 --> 00:12:55,122
Okay, every good memory

266
00:12:55,209 --> 00:12:57,907
that I have is in this house.

267
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:00,388
This is my home, so..

268
00:13:00,475 --> 00:13:02,782
Oh, honey.
No, no, no, no, no.

269
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:04,522
It was your home

270
00:13:04,609 --> 00:13:07,482
but when your father died,
it became my home.

271
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:11,660
My dad..

272
00:13:11,747 --> 00:13:16,317
...built this home with his
own hands...board by board.

273
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:19,233
Yes, and when we sell it,
they will tear it apart..

274
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,538
...board by board.

275
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,757
Bored.

276
00:13:28,242 --> 00:13:29,721
'I-I don't know.'

277
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,288
We don't know.
We don't do that.

278
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,900
No, no, no. That's..

279
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,903
Oh, are you and your boyfriend
going on a date?

280
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,167
I'm taking the pig to market.

281
00:13:40,254 --> 00:13:41,646
- Oh, good.
- Yes.

282
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,257
And she'll cry "Wee, wee, wee"

283
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,693
all the way home.

284
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,913
That is so mean.

285
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,089
Thank you, Saffron.

286
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,569
- I think it's funny.
- Okay, bored with that.

287
00:13:51,656 --> 00:13:53,180
- Back to me!
- Okay, show me again.

288
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:10,545
Oh, don't listen
to them, Jon Ham.

289
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:13,330
I would never let them
do anything to hurt you.

290
00:14:13,417 --> 00:14:14,897
I'm just going to take you
to go see Jerry the Vet.

291
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:16,464
What?

292
00:14:16,551 --> 00:14:19,684
No. He's not gonna give
you a shot, I promise.

293
00:14:19,771 --> 00:14:22,209
He's just gonna watch you
for a couple of days

294
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:24,559
until Valerian
forgets about you

295
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:26,517
and then I can sneak you
back into the barn.

296
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,737
Okay?

297
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:31,435
- Oh, hi, Finley!
- Oh, hi, Louise!

298
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:34,090
- Hi, Jon Ham.
- Say hi.

299
00:14:34,177 --> 00:14:35,396
Have you sold
any houses lately?

300
00:14:35,483 --> 00:14:36,745
Not if I can help it.

301
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:39,052
I like this town
just the way it is.

302
00:14:39,139 --> 00:14:40,923
Yeah. Us too.

303
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,838
- We'll catch you later.
- Okay, bye now.

304
00:14:42,925 --> 00:14:44,231
Bye, Louise.

305
00:14:44,318 --> 00:14:45,449
Come on.

306
00:14:48,278 --> 00:14:50,280
Here we go!

307
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:53,240
Come on! It's like a playdate.
You like Jerry.

308
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,155
You do!

309
00:14:57,635 --> 00:14:58,593
Oh!

310
00:14:59,681 --> 00:15:01,335
Dang it, Jerry.

311
00:15:03,728 --> 00:15:05,382
Yee-haw!

312
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,676
Yes! Perfect. Cut.
Thank you.

313
00:16:21,763 --> 00:16:23,373
Okay, that's a cut.
Dancers, take ten.

314
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,809
'That was good, Peter.
Thank you.'

315
00:16:24,896 --> 00:16:27,551
That one was better
than the last one.

316
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:29,814
Sophia, can we keep that last
leg they're moving like that?

317
00:16:29,901 --> 00:16:31,294
That was awesome.
Thank you, Peter.

318
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,428
Okay..

319
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:37,387
Jon Ham, I need you
to pay attention.

320
00:16:37,474 --> 00:16:40,564
I need you to be
a very good boy, okay?

321
00:16:40,651 --> 00:16:42,001
'Like, a beat sooner
on that next one.'

322
00:16:42,088 --> 00:16:43,306
- Can you do that?
- 'Well, thank you.'

323
00:16:43,393 --> 00:16:44,699
This is my chance.

324
00:16:47,093 --> 00:16:49,182
'Alright, guys, let's get it
cleared out over here.'

325
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,663
Okay, who's next?

326
00:16:53,751 --> 00:16:54,970
Anyone wanna..

327
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,016
...audition today?

328
00:16:58,452 --> 00:17:00,193
- I'll go.
- Great. Okay.

329
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,498
Hop on up on the stage.

330
00:17:01,585 --> 00:17:02,760
Okay? Trevor!

331
00:17:03,979 --> 00:17:05,285
'Trevor!'

332
00:17:08,157 --> 00:17:09,985
'She's over in the trailer.
Do you need her?'

333
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:11,508
Okay, Trevor,
we are ready for you.

334
00:17:11,595 --> 00:17:13,510
Oh, hey, oh, I gotta go.
Okay. Talk soon.

335
00:17:13,597 --> 00:17:14,642
Buh-bye.

336
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,905
- Uh, fun.
- Mm-hmm.

337
00:17:16,992 --> 00:17:19,386
'So, uh, who's next here?'

338
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:20,952
'Okay, first up.'

339
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,173
Uh, okay, sweetheart

340
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,392
'let's see what you got.'

341
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:26,654
- Sorry.
- 'That's alright.'

342
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:28,221
'Take your time.
Any time you're ready.'

343
00:17:28,308 --> 00:17:30,092
- 'Quiet down.'
- 'Who's this? Okay, good.'

She's good, like..

361
00:18:40,031 --> 00:18:41,511
She's great!

362
00:18:41,598 --> 00:18:42,947
She could play Wyatt.

363
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:46,777
Yeah. That's a
guy's role.

364
00:18:46,864 --> 00:18:48,475
I need saloon girls, right?

365
00:18:48,562 --> 00:18:50,041
What is, what's all that?

366
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,306
Well...why can't a girl
play the role?

367
00:18:53,393 --> 00:18:55,743
'There were great female
gunslingers back in the day.'

368
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,790
Annie Oakley,
Calamity Jane, Mary Fields..

369
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:03,011
Yeah, I'm just not gonna do
that. I'm not gonna do that.

370
00:19:03,098 --> 00:19:05,056
And I don't know who they are,
so I can't really reference it

371
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
but this is what I'm thinking.

372
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,278
I'm not using any of this,
but I love that you're trying.

373
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,066
No! Stay, Jon Ham.

374
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:17,852
Stay! Come on! Come on!

375
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,166
- No! Jon Ham!
- Whoa!

376
00:19:27,253 --> 00:19:28,341
No!

377
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:32,301
- Hey! Hey!
- Hey!

378
00:19:34,869 --> 00:19:36,175
Is that a pig?

379
00:19:38,351 --> 00:19:39,656
Jon Ham!

380
00:19:43,399 --> 00:19:45,880
Jon Ham! Jon Ham!
I'm so sorry.

381
00:19:45,967 --> 00:19:47,316
Jon Ham! Right now!
Come here, right now!

382
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:51,277
Is that... Finley?

383
00:19:51,364 --> 00:19:53,279
Oh, sorry! Excuse me.
Jon Ham! Jon Ham!

384
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:01,548
Ooh!

385
00:20:01,635 --> 00:20:02,592
Oh!

386
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:05,726
This is so embarrassing
for her.

387
00:20:05,813 --> 00:20:07,945
It's the best.

388
00:20:11,645 --> 00:20:13,429
Jon Ham.

389
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:16,998
'Some pretty impressive
wrangling there.'

390
00:20:18,782 --> 00:20:20,567
Yeah. Not too
bad yourself.

391
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:30,490
Jackson Stone?

392
00:20:31,665 --> 00:20:33,319
Yeah.

393
00:20:33,406 --> 00:20:35,712
Let's, uh, let's
get you out of this mud.

394
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:42,545
There you go.

395
00:20:42,632 --> 00:20:43,764
Sorry.

396
00:20:45,853 --> 00:20:47,811
Say..

397
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:50,249
Where'd you learn
to rope like that?

398
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:54,165
I...I'm usually better.

399
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:56,342
Somebody get
Jackson out of there, please.

400
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:57,430
Yeah.

401
00:21:00,346 --> 00:21:01,477
- Jackson?
- Yeah?

402
00:21:01,564 --> 00:21:02,609
- We gotta get you out.
- Excuse me.

403
00:21:02,696 --> 00:21:03,871
- I'm so sorry.
- 'Two seconds.'

404
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,525
I didn't mean to.

405
00:21:05,612 --> 00:21:06,917
- Yeah.
- Is that your pig?

406
00:21:08,789 --> 00:21:10,443
- Yes. Yes, sir. He is.
- Okay, great.

407
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,010
Get off my set
and take your pig with you.

408
00:21:13,097 --> 00:21:15,099
And I don't want to see
your face again, you understand?

409
00:21:15,186 --> 00:21:17,145
- I understand. I'm--
- Okay, good. Get going.

410
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,584
Yeah! Go home, Pig Girl!

411
00:21:21,671 --> 00:21:23,499
Get out of here, Pig Girl!

412
00:21:23,586 --> 00:21:26,110
Yeah, get out, Pig Girl!

413
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:28,591
- What was that? That was good.
- I don't know what that was.

414
00:21:28,678 --> 00:21:30,767
Hey, it's okay.

415
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,815
- That is so annoying.
- Come on.

416
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:37,252
She always ruins
everything for me.

417
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,472
We'd better get going,
move on to the next set-up.

418
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:40,734
I hear you, Derek, all good.

419
00:21:42,605 --> 00:21:44,172
- Jackson!
- Kenny.

420
00:21:44,259 --> 00:21:47,480
You okay? That was, I mean,
that was crazy, right?

421
00:21:47,567 --> 00:21:48,959
You bet. Real wild.

422
00:21:49,046 --> 00:21:50,134
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

423
00:21:50,221 --> 00:21:51,962
So, um, you, uh,
you wanna

424
00:21:52,049 --> 00:21:53,529
do you wanna practice
some of the stunts?

425
00:21:53,616 --> 00:21:55,444
I'll tell you what, Kenny,
uh, not right now.

426
00:21:55,531 --> 00:21:57,098
I gotta get back,
alright?

427
00:21:57,968 --> 00:21:59,187
Okay, cool, I just..

428
00:22:00,754 --> 00:22:02,712
Say, you know who that
girl was back there?

429
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:04,627
I don't know, just some local.

430
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:19,555
Pork chop, pork loin,
spare ribs, bacon.

431
00:22:21,557 --> 00:22:23,733
Is everybody happy?

432
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,953
Oh, don't take that tone
with me, little Pig Girl.

433
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,476
If you had just done
what I asked

434
00:22:27,563 --> 00:22:29,304
you wouldn't have been
humiliated.

435
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,654
Yeah, now I have to prepare
all over again for my audition.

436
00:22:31,741 --> 00:22:32,829
Did you get any ham?

437
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:43,710
- Great day.
- Good day.

438
00:22:43,797 --> 00:22:45,712
Well, I mean, you were good.

439
00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,278
We have to find
our legs on our end

440
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:48,367
but this is
how this stuff goes.

441
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:49,933
You know, it takes
the first week.

442
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,632
Jackson, hi. Wardrobe would like
you to try these on.

443
00:22:52,719 --> 00:22:55,069
Uh, sure, but did they have
this color back then?

444
00:22:55,156 --> 00:22:56,853
- I don't know.
- You don't like this?

445
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,029
- I don't think it plays.
- Yeah, I'm with you.

446
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:01,336
Thank you. Appreciate that.
Great work today.

447
00:23:01,423 --> 00:23:03,033
- Sorry, man.
- Um..

448
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,861
Quickly, I can have him fired
if he's annoying you.

449
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:06,123
- No! No, no. I don't wanna--
- Are you sure?

450
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:07,864
- Excuse me, excuse me, Trevor.
- Yeah?

451
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:09,910
For the flashback, which one?

452
00:23:09,997 --> 00:23:11,302
- Neither.
- Both.

453
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,217
- Um, so, tomorrow's a big day.
- Yeah.

454
00:23:13,304 --> 00:23:15,481
And I'm thinking
for that scene, um--

455
00:23:15,568 --> 00:23:17,570
Okay, hold on a second, Trevor.
I've got to ask you something.

456
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:19,136
- Alright.
- Tell me.

457
00:23:19,223 --> 00:23:20,486
Talk to me. I'm here.

458
00:23:20,573 --> 00:23:22,966
That girl today
from the audition.

459
00:23:23,053 --> 00:23:25,578
- The wild, muddy mess.
- Pig Girl?

460
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:27,841
Don't...please don't
call her that.

461
00:23:27,928 --> 00:23:32,019
No, no, no! I don't call her
that. That's what they call her.

462
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:33,760
They call her "Pig Girl."
I would never call her that.

463
00:23:33,847 --> 00:23:35,979
Look, listen, um..

464
00:23:36,066 --> 00:23:38,634
Do you think we can find
out who she is?

465
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,897
- You think we should sue her?
- No.

466
00:23:40,984 --> 00:23:43,683
No, I, look, I-I-I just can't
get her out of my head.

467
00:23:45,685 --> 00:23:47,556
Why? You spent, like,
20 seconds with her.

468
00:23:47,643 --> 00:23:50,124
Okay, and it was the first
real 20 seconds I've had

469
00:23:50,211 --> 00:23:51,604
since I started this business.

470
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:58,262
Aw, come on, man.

471
00:23:58,349 --> 00:24:00,395
You little sucker, come on.

472
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:03,093
Okay, Trev, look, I-I-I don't
mean it like that. Alright?

473
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,008
What I mean i-is this..

474
00:24:05,095 --> 00:24:06,749
...all of this nonsense

475
00:24:06,836 --> 00:24:09,404
alright, it does,
it doesn't speak to me.

476
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:11,972
That beautiful girl back there
with the pig, she spoke to me.

477
00:24:14,148 --> 00:24:15,932
Okay, Jackson.

478
00:24:16,019 --> 00:24:19,153
Listen, you want to go frolic
in a pigsty..

479
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,415
...I want that for you.

480
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,548
I think it's important, okay?

481
00:24:22,635 --> 00:24:25,115
But right now we gotta focus.
It's a lot of pressure.

482
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:26,508
This is a big movie
and we're going to do this

483
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:28,641
because we're a team, right?

484
00:24:28,728 --> 00:24:30,338
We're going to finish
this movie

485
00:24:30,425 --> 00:24:33,646
and then you and I are gonna
dive into my next movie.

486
00:24:33,733 --> 00:24:36,257
And then, you are going to be
an A-list star

487
00:24:36,344 --> 00:24:39,782
and you can pick
any chick you want.

488
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:42,132
- Mm.
- Right? You understand?

489
00:24:42,219 --> 00:24:45,309
Tomorrow's a big day.

490
00:24:45,396 --> 00:24:48,225
Let's get some rest.
Boom!

491
00:24:48,312 --> 00:24:49,618
- You're the man.
- You got it, Trev.

492
00:24:49,705 --> 00:24:51,446
'You are the man.'

493
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:57,365
'Today was
a really bad day, dad.'

494
00:24:58,584 --> 00:25:00,237
They all called me "Pig Girl."

495
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,502
Yeah.

496
00:25:05,591 --> 00:25:07,288
This was my only chance.

497
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:12,119
It's never
gonna happen, is it?

498
00:25:16,471 --> 00:25:19,169
And you!

499
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:21,781
You owe me big-time, Jon Ham.

500
00:25:23,173 --> 00:25:24,435
You do.

501
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:33,401
You're lucky they didn't
ban us from auditioning

502
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:35,969
after your little stunt. Ow!

503
00:25:36,056 --> 00:25:38,362
You have any idea what a day
like that can cost production?

504
00:25:38,449 --> 00:25:40,408
100k, easy.

505
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:43,237
Okay, well, they don't even
know that we're related, Kale.

506
00:25:43,324 --> 00:25:44,847
Okay, let's keep it that way.

507
00:25:44,934 --> 00:25:46,675
- Stop!
- Hold still.

508
00:25:46,762 --> 00:25:48,285
If anyone finds out
you're Pig Girl

509
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:49,548
you'll ruin it for all of us.

510
00:25:50,505 --> 00:25:52,028
Wow.

511
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:53,421
Is that what you're wearing?

512
00:25:53,508 --> 00:25:54,857
I don't take fashion advice

513
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:56,990
from people who are
covered in pig poop.

514
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:00,733
- Burn.
- You like that?

515
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:03,039
Okay, don't wait up for us.

516
00:26:03,126 --> 00:26:05,259
I'm sure we'll be invited
to the after-party.

517
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:07,130
Oh, there's no after-party.

518
00:26:07,217 --> 00:26:08,523
There's always an after-party.

519
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,307
That's after you
finish the job.

520
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:12,440
- 'Then, there's a pre-party.'
- 'There-there's no party.'

521
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,290
I don't know what to say.

522
00:26:43,036 --> 00:26:44,428
There's something about it
that I just--

523
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:45,691
- I'll be back.
- This is pretty cool.

524
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:48,781
No, maybe you're right,
maybe it's awful.

525
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:50,217
Yeah.

526
00:26:50,304 --> 00:26:52,001
Great job, Terry and Tina.

527
00:26:52,088 --> 00:26:55,439
Loved that. Oh, and loved those
little congas and the washboard.

528
00:26:55,526 --> 00:26:57,354
We're gonna get
to you guys very soon, okay?

529
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:59,182
- I'm their manager.
- Oh, good to know.

530
00:26:59,269 --> 00:27:00,401
Yay! Yay!

531
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:05,449
It is. I know, it is.
It is totally unfair.

532
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:07,451
It is the one thing
that I've ever wanted

533
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:11,368
in my entire life and it
is never going to happen.

534
00:27:12,805 --> 00:27:13,980
How? How am I supposed to..

535
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:16,722
Exactly. Thank you, Jon Ham.

536
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:18,158
He gets it, you guys.

537
00:27:18,245 --> 00:27:20,682
I mean, the director
literally said to me

538
00:27:20,769 --> 00:27:23,642
that he never wants to see
my face again.

539
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,252
So..

540
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,386
I don't know what you guys
want me to do about that.

541
00:27:37,264 --> 00:27:39,179
Well, giddyup.

542
00:27:39,266 --> 00:27:41,660
Okay, next group, please.

543
00:27:41,747 --> 00:27:42,704
You have the track? Okay!

544
00:27:44,271 --> 00:27:47,404
Oh, it's, great,
okay, action.

545
00:27:47,491 --> 00:27:50,103
- Who's this?
- The sisters?

546
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,321
- Sisters?
- Hello.

547
00:27:51,408 --> 00:27:52,627
- 'Hello.'
- Hi.

548
00:27:52,714 --> 00:27:53,889
'Hi, how are you?'

549
00:27:53,976 --> 00:27:55,325
- Hi.
- Hi.

550
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:56,762
'Any-any time you're ready.'

551
00:27:56,849 --> 00:27:59,678
Dolls, let's-let's
see-see what you got.

552
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,987
Hoo-wee!

553
00:28:05,074 --> 00:28:07,947
It sure is a hot one today.

554
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:11,298
Hoo-wee! It sure is
a hot one today!

555
00:28:11,385 --> 00:28:12,603
- That's what I just said.
- I know.

556
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,909
- But I can't remember my lines.
- Soffy..

557
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:15,650
'What do I say?
I forgot my lines.'

558
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:16,912
Uh, you know what,
ladies, just

559
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:18,609
you can just cut
right to the song.

560
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,133
- Okay!
- 'No pressure.'

561
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,525
Okay!

562
00:28:21,612 --> 00:28:22,831
I can.. Okay.

563
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,529
We got this, yes.

564
00:28:26,617 --> 00:28:29,490
Nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

- Sorry.
- It's okay.

576
00:28:57,213 --> 00:28:59,215
Okay, and cut!

577
00:28:59,302 --> 00:29:02,131
Thank you so much. Very good,
very good. Thank you.

578
00:29:02,218 --> 00:29:03,437
Okay!

579
00:29:03,524 --> 00:29:04,743
- Hire the girl.
- What?

580
00:29:06,527 --> 00:29:10,400
But she can't sing
or dance or act.

581
00:29:10,487 --> 00:29:11,706
No, she doesn't need to.

582
00:29:13,186 --> 00:29:16,363
- Thanks!
- Uh, okay. Uh, anyone else?

583
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:19,148
'Uh, you, uh, you got
room for one more?'

584
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:37,776
Howdy, ladies.

585
00:29:37,863 --> 00:29:39,255
Why don't you
hop up on stage

586
00:29:39,342 --> 00:29:40,953
and-and show us
what you got, partner?

587
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,998
Yes, sir, yes, sir.

588
00:29:43,085 --> 00:29:45,696
Excuse-excuse me, ladies.
Sorry about that.

589
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:49,831
He's cute, right?

590
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:55,576
Any time you're ready.

591
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:02,278
Clouds as mean
as you've ever seen.

592
00:30:03,932 --> 00:30:06,543
Yeah.

593
00:30:06,630 --> 00:30:08,894
Ain't a bird that
knows your tune.

594
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,986
Then there's a little
voice inside you

595
00:30:14,073 --> 00:30:16,336
that keeps on saying..

596
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:18,555
"Kid..

597
00:30:18,642 --> 00:30:20,035
don't sell your dreams so soon."

598
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,430
That's the theme song
from the Fuller House?

599
00:30:23,517 --> 00:30:25,258
Sshhh! Shush!

600
00:30:25,345 --> 00:30:27,173
'Everywhere you look..'

601
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:31,742
everywhere that you go..

602
00:30:34,658 --> 00:30:35,834
there's a heart..

603
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:39,750
...there is a heart..

604
00:30:41,927 --> 00:30:43,842
...a hand to hold onto.

605
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:48,020
'Everywhere you look..'

606
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:50,283
everywhere you go,
there is a face..

607
00:30:53,634 --> 00:30:55,375
...of somebody who needs you.

608
00:30:59,118 --> 00:31:00,641
Everywhere you look.

609
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,168
Yeah.

610
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,744
What? Sorry.

611
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:19,965
That, that's it. That, that's
all I got for the monologue.

612
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:32,716
- So..
- That's "Fuller House."

613
00:31:32,803 --> 00:31:35,806
That was, ah, that was
surprisingly good.

614
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,634
Real nice work, man.

615
00:31:37,721 --> 00:31:39,288
That was my favorite
show growing up.

616
00:31:41,073 --> 00:31:42,726
What's your name, kid?

617
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:45,381
Huh. Fin...Fin..

618
00:31:48,689 --> 00:31:51,779
Uh, last name, Finn.

619
00:31:51,866 --> 00:31:53,302
First name, uh..

620
00:31:53,389 --> 00:31:57,045
...Huckleberry?

621
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:58,177
Yeah.

622
00:31:58,264 --> 00:31:59,874
You know, my-my parents were

623
00:31:59,961 --> 00:32:02,181
real Mark Twain fans, you know?
So..

624
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:03,182
- Oh..
- Alright.

625
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:05,314
You know. Yeah, yeah.

626
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:08,143
But, um..

627
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,536
...you all can call me "Huck."

628
00:32:10,754 --> 00:32:12,669
- Okay.
- Huck.

629
00:32:14,889 --> 00:32:16,804
So, the following people
have been chosen

630
00:32:16,891 --> 00:32:18,066
Caletta Rose..

631
00:32:19,372 --> 00:32:20,547
Great. Great, great, great.

632
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:22,418
And, uh, Saffron Tremaine..

633
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:26,335
And Huck Finn.
Great.

634
00:32:26,422 --> 00:32:29,338
Oops, sorry, folks.
Hold tight, just a second.

635
00:32:29,425 --> 00:32:30,687
Yes?

636
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,255
What?

637
00:32:34,648 --> 00:32:36,563
How?

638
00:32:40,088 --> 00:32:42,134
- I can't wait..
- Ahh! A-ahem!

639
00:32:42,221 --> 00:32:43,483
To work you.

640
00:32:44,832 --> 00:32:47,182
You mean, work with me.

641
00:32:48,923 --> 00:32:50,272
Whatever.

642
00:32:53,058 --> 00:32:55,669
We lost the farm house.

643
00:32:55,756 --> 00:32:57,149
What do you mean
we lost the farm house?

644
00:32:57,236 --> 00:32:59,499
- Where did it go?
- It collapsed.

645
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:01,501
I just saw it yesterday, Bernie.

646
00:33:01,588 --> 00:33:02,893
Well, it's gone today.

647
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,591
We shoot the farm house
in two days!

648
00:33:04,678 --> 00:33:06,288
How are we going to
find another location?

649
00:33:06,375 --> 00:33:07,811
We're going to
figure something out.

650
00:33:07,898 --> 00:33:10,945
Ah-ah-ah!
If-if I may? Hi.

651
00:33:11,032 --> 00:33:13,121
Um, just happened to overhear.

652
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:15,123
She's a patron of the arts.

653
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:18,561
Yes, yes and I want
to proposition you.

654
00:33:21,173 --> 00:33:25,525
- She has a proposition for you.
- Yes.

655
00:33:25,612 --> 00:33:29,616
I just happen to be the owner of
a historical country farm house.

656
00:33:29,703 --> 00:33:31,444
True.

657
00:33:31,531 --> 00:33:37,711
And we have a barn, and a
chicken coop, chickens, goats

658
00:33:37,798 --> 00:33:40,018
filing cabinets,
hay, lots of hay..

659
00:33:40,105 --> 00:33:41,802
Big property.
It's a big property.

660
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,760
The kind that you would need
for a production of this size.

661
00:33:43,847 --> 00:33:45,980
Brass tacks, boys.

662
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:47,590
How much is it going
to cost me

663
00:33:47,677 --> 00:33:49,114
to have you shoot
your movie at my place?

664
00:33:49,201 --> 00:33:51,768
No, no, she's kidding,
she's kidding.

665
00:33:51,855 --> 00:33:53,727
They pay us, not
the other way around.

666
00:33:53,814 --> 00:33:55,903
Why don't we just say
that you give us, uh..

667
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:58,297
I don't know, 125 percent of
what you were going to pay

668
00:33:58,384 --> 00:34:02,823
the house that you lost, throw
in some...catered lunches

669
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,347
hot, then you have
yourself a deal.

670
00:34:09,569 --> 00:34:10,787
Sure.

671
00:34:25,193 --> 00:34:26,238
Guys!

672
00:34:28,327 --> 00:34:29,502
They're here.

673
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,200
Saffron?

674
00:34:33,549 --> 00:34:34,594
Kale?

675
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:46,736
- Morning.
- Oh, have a seat, have a seat.

676
00:34:51,698 --> 00:34:54,657
You know, I actually
saw your last movie.

677
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,659
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

678
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:01,186
- Okay.
- Seen the PR.

679
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:02,796
That you're doing
for this one here.

680
00:35:02,883 --> 00:35:04,058
It's my house, actually.

681
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:07,583
Oh. You got a real
nice piece of land.

682
00:35:07,670 --> 00:35:10,412
- Say, how many horses do you..
- I don't know.

683
00:35:10,499 --> 00:35:12,936
I figure I should
be managing you.

684
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:14,590
- How's that?
- Well, do you have a manager?

685
00:35:14,677 --> 00:35:16,114
- I do not.
- You do now.

686
00:35:18,464 --> 00:35:19,813
What type of managing
do you do?

687
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,902
Ever heard of Wanda's Waffle
and Sushi House?

688
00:35:21,989 --> 00:35:23,425
I can't say I've
had the pleasure.

689
00:35:23,512 --> 00:35:25,297
You will.
Listen, are you a meat guy?

690
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:27,690
You could be the face
of Jon Ham Bacon.

691
00:35:27,777 --> 00:35:29,605
It's kind of a side
project I'm working on.

692
00:35:29,692 --> 00:35:32,260
Look, I, um, I don't think
I really need a manager.

693
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:34,784
Not a meat guy?
Surprising.

694
00:35:34,871 --> 00:35:36,482
Uh, how about tractors?

695
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:38,788
I'm working on a deal
with a local company here.

696
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,442
Uh, thank you, but no.

697
00:35:40,529 --> 00:35:41,878
No. Okay moving on,
moving on.

698
00:35:41,965 --> 00:35:43,184
I got you, though.
I got you with this one?

699
00:35:43,271 --> 00:35:45,752
- Hmm?
- Money.

700
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:48,233
Everybody likes money, right?
I'm in with the banks.

701
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,409
"Need a loan,
call Jackson Stone."

702
00:35:50,496 --> 00:35:52,280
This is all from my head, man.
I'm just winging it.

703
00:35:52,367 --> 00:35:53,455
- I'm winging it, man.
- Wow.

704
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,327
- Apologies, apologies.
- Okay, yup.

705
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,504
You're a little all over
the place, ain't ya?

706
00:36:01,376 --> 00:36:03,596
You need an animal like me
in your corner, Jackson.

707
00:36:04,945 --> 00:36:06,033
Hmm.

708
00:36:12,431 --> 00:36:13,432
Let's do this.

709
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:24,573
Wish me luck, Jon Ham.
Love you.

710
00:36:25,966 --> 00:36:27,228
Okay, Jackson,

711
00:36:27,315 --> 00:36:29,752
So, you just shot
all these guys.

712
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,406
Pow, pow, pow, pow, pow.

713
00:36:31,493 --> 00:36:32,842
- And now you're out of ammo.
- Hmm.

714
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,931
Right? Okay.

715
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:37,151
And from behind you
comes this guy.

716
00:36:37,238 --> 00:36:40,067
- Yeah. Hey, buddy.
- Kenny.

717
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:42,722
Okay. A one-on-one.
So, uh, Kenny?

718
00:36:42,809 --> 00:36:44,158
You just, you just grab him.

719
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:45,290
Okay. How do you want me
to approach it?

720
00:36:45,377 --> 00:36:47,161
I could do, like, a step over

721
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:49,859
toe-hold sleeper, or-or I could
do a figure-four arm lock.

722
00:36:49,946 --> 00:36:52,558
Yeah, that-that's great.
You just go for him.

723
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:55,996
Just...just come for me, Kenny.

724
00:36:56,083 --> 00:36:57,867
That's hot, that's hot,
that's hot, that's hot.

725
00:36:57,954 --> 00:37:00,130
- No, uh, um..
- Hi!

726
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,438
I'm just not really
comfortable winging it.

727
00:37:05,048 --> 00:37:06,224
Okay.

728
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,313
Fine.

729
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:11,229
Huck!

730
00:37:11,316 --> 00:37:12,578
Huck, hey. Hello?

731
00:37:14,188 --> 00:37:16,059
Oh. Ahem.

732
00:37:16,146 --> 00:37:18,714
Yeah, uh, I'm so,
so sorry, folks.

733
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:21,587
Huck. Huck is here.
Yeah.

734
00:37:21,674 --> 00:37:22,892
- Hi. Hi.
- Hi.

735
00:37:22,979 --> 00:37:24,242
Uh, you ever do any stunts?

736
00:37:25,199 --> 00:37:27,288
Oh, yeah.

737
00:37:27,375 --> 00:37:30,117
Two, two years
of gymnastics, so.

738
00:37:30,204 --> 00:37:32,598
That's, that's good.
Uh, go for him.

739
00:37:32,685 --> 00:37:34,469
Uh, he's not,
he's not in the union...

740
00:37:34,556 --> 00:37:35,862
No, that's fine.
Thanks, Kenny.

741
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,255
Just go.
Just go for him.

742
00:37:37,342 --> 00:37:39,387
Uh-uh, okay.

743
00:37:39,474 --> 00:37:40,649
- Yeah. Right now?
- Yeah.

744
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,868
- Alright.
- From back there.

745
00:37:41,955 --> 00:37:43,304
Yeah.

746
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:45,611
- Ready?
- Yes, I am.

747
00:37:45,698 --> 00:37:46,786
Ready.

748
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:50,485
- Yeah.
- That's perfect.

749
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:52,095
- That's great, that's great.
- Alright.

750
00:37:52,182 --> 00:37:54,620
Oh, well, i-it's okay.
You see, I could do that!

751
00:37:54,707 --> 00:37:56,361
I just thought you
wanted something..

752
00:37:56,448 --> 00:37:58,711
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

753
00:37:58,798 --> 00:38:01,061
Actually, I'm thinking,
Kenny, maybe you, uh

754
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:02,628
might want to have
a break there.

755
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:04,847
- Cool. Cool, cool, cool, cool.
- Yeah, yeah.

756
00:38:04,934 --> 00:38:07,110
Yeah. It's probably tired from
all that work. Thanks, buddy.

757
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:13,595
Uh, thank you, you know,
for going easy on me.

758
00:38:13,682 --> 00:38:16,381
Ah, well, you know,
I got little cousins

759
00:38:16,468 --> 00:38:17,643
we used to play fight
all the time.

760
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:19,297
That's all this is,
you know?

761
00:38:19,384 --> 00:38:22,212
- Yeah.
- Anyhow, you're a lightweight.

762
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,389
What do you weigh?
About 130-135?

763
00:38:24,476 --> 00:38:26,129
123, thank..

764
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:29,829
Thank you very much.

765
00:38:29,916 --> 00:38:32,527
- That was a joke.
- I gotcha.

766
00:38:32,614 --> 00:38:34,355
You were so good.

767
00:38:34,442 --> 00:38:35,878
'Let's shoot this.'

768
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:38,533
And remember, we're going
to do this in a one-er.

769
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,188
Which means we're going to shoot
the whole scene in one shot.

770
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:44,322
Okay? Everyone, remember here,
timing is everything.

771
00:38:44,409 --> 00:38:46,062
So, if even one piece
of the puzzle is off

772
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:47,281
the whole thing falls apart.

773
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:48,717
So that's, so, what is

774
00:38:48,804 --> 00:38:50,415
what is that?
Is that a phone?

775
00:38:50,502 --> 00:38:52,939
- Bernie, Bernie, Bernie!
- Phones off! Please!

776
00:38:53,026 --> 00:38:54,549
- Come on, guys.
- Sorry, guys. Sorry.

777
00:38:54,636 --> 00:38:56,508
- That's alright. We get it.
- All good.

778
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:59,032
So, Jackson, I want you
to enter from over there, okay?

779
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,295
And, Huck, uh, you can
go around the corner

780
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:04,298
and wait for your cue, okay?
Now, listen, don't miss this.

781
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:06,387
If you miss it, you're going
to screw up the whole take

782
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:08,041
and then I'll have to beat
the crap out of you.

783
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:12,350
I'm joking, I'm joking.

784
00:39:12,437 --> 00:39:14,526
But I will fire you.

785
00:39:14,613 --> 00:39:16,832
So there's that,
you could get fired.

786
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,660
- That's not a joke.
- No, that one's not joking.

787
00:39:18,747 --> 00:39:20,096
- Yes.
- Okay, good. Good luck.

788
00:39:20,183 --> 00:39:21,881
See you on the other side.
Here we go.

789
00:39:21,968 --> 00:39:23,143
Let's try one.

790
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,059
Okay, lock it up!
Roll sound!

791
00:39:28,496 --> 00:39:29,584
Oh, my gosh.

792
00:39:29,671 --> 00:39:31,194
- 'And action.'
- Hi. Okay.

793
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:33,501
I know I look
very, very strange.

794
00:39:33,588 --> 00:39:36,243
I'm going to have to do
this real quick.

795
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:39,202
Good girl.
Good girl.

796
00:39:39,289 --> 00:39:41,509
'Finley!'

797
00:39:41,596 --> 00:39:42,554
What?

798
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:51,345
No, no, no, no, no. No.

799
00:39:51,432 --> 00:39:53,303
Alright.

800
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,740
'Finley!'

801
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:07,535
Yes.

802
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:14,803
Where are you?
Where have you been?

803
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,371
You told me to milk the cow,
so I'm milking the cow.

804
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:18,677
Is that what you're doing?

805
00:40:18,764 --> 00:40:20,983
- Yeah.
- That is disgusting.

806
00:40:21,070 --> 00:40:23,943
Yeah. Yeah.

807
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,335
You know what? It only gets

808
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,772
really worse from here,
so you should probably

809
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:29,905
just go, like, right now.
Like, right now!

810
00:40:29,992 --> 00:40:32,952
- You should go.
- Fine. I'm leaving.

811
00:40:33,039 --> 00:40:35,171
There's got to be a better
way to get the milk out.

812
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:38,871
'Hi!'

813
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,916
- Hi.
- How's the filming going?

814
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:42,048
Filming's going well. We're
actually rolling right now.

815
00:40:42,135 --> 00:40:43,571
Oh, rolling?
Okay, shh, she, shh.

816
00:40:43,658 --> 00:40:45,138
- Rolling! Rolling.
- Yeah.

817
00:40:46,356 --> 00:40:48,707
I owe you. Okay.

818
00:40:48,794 --> 00:40:50,970
Jackson! Jackson.
Your cue, please.

819
00:40:51,057 --> 00:40:52,188
Now, please.

820
00:40:55,844 --> 00:40:56,758
Oh!

821
00:41:05,419 --> 00:41:07,552
Seriously?

822
00:41:09,684 --> 00:41:12,426
Alright. You wanna play.
Let's play.

823
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:17,083
Come on, come on.
Who's a good boy?

824
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,477
Are you a good boy?
Come on. Come on.

825
00:41:19,564 --> 00:41:22,480
Let go. Let go!
Thank you.

826
00:41:26,135 --> 00:41:27,746
Hope that was worth
getting shot for.

827
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:35,449
Cut! Yes!

828
00:41:35,536 --> 00:41:36,972
- Huck?
- 'Yes!'

829
00:41:37,059 --> 00:41:38,278
Come on up.

830
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:40,193
- Oh, boys.
- Thank you, Jackson.

831
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,717
You're a star, man.
You are a star.

832
00:41:42,804 --> 00:41:45,154
- Thanks, Trev.
- Any time!

833
00:41:45,241 --> 00:41:46,939
Huck, you nailed that.

834
00:41:47,026 --> 00:41:48,767
You nailed that timing.
That's what I'm talking about.

835
00:41:48,854 --> 00:41:50,246
- Really?
- That round-the-corner wave.

836
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,683
You didn't miss it.
You nailed it.

837
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,859
- Okay, let's move on.
- Okay.

838
00:41:53,946 --> 00:41:55,513
- 'And we're moving on.'
- 'I'm thinking drone.'

839
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,384
Oh!

840
00:41:57,471 --> 00:41:58,603
Jacket.

841
00:42:01,170 --> 00:42:02,998
Ah! Inside out.

842
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,348
Oh.

843
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:12,834
Hey, if you need help with your
pants later, you let me know.

844
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:15,141
Oh, my god! What are you..
What is your..

845
00:42:15,228 --> 00:42:17,622
You know, I really
appreciate that offer.

846
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:19,624
Good lookin'.

847
00:42:22,061 --> 00:42:23,192
Any time.

848
00:42:24,977 --> 00:42:27,545
- Yeah, you're good.
- Alright. Thank you.

849
00:42:30,678 --> 00:42:33,115
Hey, uh, Huck.

850
00:42:33,202 --> 00:42:34,552
Ahem. Jackson.

851
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:36,641
Really, uh, really nice
work today.

852
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:38,904
Man, you almost made me
bust up. I swear.

853
00:42:40,296 --> 00:42:41,994
Well, I'm..

854
00:42:42,081 --> 00:42:46,215
Thank you, you know, so much.
I.. I'm not gonna lie.

855
00:42:46,302 --> 00:42:48,130
I'm sorta freaking out
that Trevor let me do

856
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:50,350
that scene with you.

857
00:42:50,437 --> 00:42:53,875
Listen, listen. He let you
do it because you're good.

858
00:42:53,962 --> 00:42:55,529
Alright, you're not afraid
to just go for it.

859
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,749
That takes balls.

860
00:42:57,836 --> 00:42:59,315
Yeah, I-I got, I got those.

861
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:02,884
So, um...

862
00:43:02,971 --> 00:43:05,234
what do you do
for fun around here?

863
00:43:05,321 --> 00:43:07,672
Oh, ah..

864
00:43:07,759 --> 00:43:10,109
There's a really nice lake,
actually. You can go fishing.

865
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:13,242
Hmm.

866
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:18,030
I-I'm sorry. You, um, you
probably meant for a night life.

867
00:43:18,117 --> 00:43:20,206
Yeah, I'm looking for
a hot after-hours club.

868
00:43:21,337 --> 00:43:23,035
Nah, I'm kidding!

869
00:43:23,122 --> 00:43:24,297
Here, sit.

870
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,430
- Thanks.
- No problem.

871
00:43:28,649 --> 00:43:30,259
That lake sounds real nice.

872
00:43:34,916 --> 00:43:36,309
Man..

873
00:43:38,137 --> 00:43:41,401
You must just wake up and pinch
yourself every single day.

874
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:45,013
Now how's that?

875
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:51,411
I-I mean, you-you get to travel
the world, you know, for free.

876
00:43:51,498 --> 00:43:53,718
You live the dream
of every single actor.

877
00:43:53,805 --> 00:43:55,241
You're playing all
these great parts

878
00:43:55,328 --> 00:43:56,721
working with the
best directors.

879
00:43:56,808 --> 00:43:59,332
- It's..
- Hmm.

880
00:43:59,419 --> 00:44:02,422
Nah, look the truth is..

881
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:05,904
...I'd give all this up

882
00:44:05,991 --> 00:44:07,688
to be back at my uncle's ranch.

883
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:10,648
You know, riding my horse

884
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:12,998
taking care of the land.

885
00:44:14,129 --> 00:44:17,480
Yeah. That sounds real nice.

886
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:22,181
Hey, Jackson, I'm sorry,
I, I gotta ask, um..

887
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,272
How did you get here?

888
00:44:27,577 --> 00:44:29,536
Ah, well, ah..

889
00:44:31,059 --> 00:44:33,671
It was like in the movies.

890
00:44:33,758 --> 00:44:35,847
A Hollywood producer
and his wife showed up

891
00:44:35,934 --> 00:44:38,980
and discovered me.

892
00:44:39,067 --> 00:44:42,767
Now I got two more movies
lined up after this one, and..

893
00:44:42,854 --> 00:44:45,073
you know, all I want to do
is get back on the ranch, so..

894
00:44:47,206 --> 00:44:49,338
But, what are you
gonna do, right?

895
00:44:51,384 --> 00:44:52,690
What are you gonna do?

896
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:55,388
'Alright, we are back people.'

897
00:44:55,475 --> 00:44:57,564
Well, looks like we're back.

898
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:00,785
Oh..

899
00:45:00,872 --> 00:45:02,656
Hey, uh, hey, Huck?

900
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:03,918
Yeah?

901
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:06,747
I like talking with you.

902
00:45:09,315 --> 00:45:12,710
Yeah, me-me too, Jackson.

903
00:45:12,797 --> 00:45:14,233
- I'll see you out there.

924
00:46:53,985 --> 00:46:57,727
Day after tomorrow,
we shoot the big finale scene.

925
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:00,469
It is also
our last day of shoot.

926
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:03,733
So, we've got a huge day today.

927
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:07,259
'But you all have
a day off tomorrow.'

928
00:47:07,346 --> 00:47:09,087
Yeah, I hear ya.

929
00:47:09,174 --> 00:47:11,437
So, whaddya got goin'
for your day off?

930
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:17,008
Day off? I, um..

931
00:47:17,095 --> 00:47:19,271
I haven't really had one
of those in a real long time.

932
00:47:19,358 --> 00:47:21,403
Hmm. Nah, look, look, look

933
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:23,101
you gotta take advantage of 'em.

934
00:47:23,188 --> 00:47:25,755
Alright? These long days on set
will catch up with you.

935
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,888
'Please do not play
with your prop guns.'

936
00:47:27,975 --> 00:47:30,935
'Well, I'm going
to sleep in tomorrow'

937
00:47:31,022 --> 00:47:32,501
and then I'm going
to check out this town.

938
00:47:33,415 --> 00:47:34,721
I like it here.

939
00:47:36,505 --> 00:47:37,811
'Let's do this!'

940
00:47:37,898 --> 00:47:39,813
'Let's get this show
on the road!'

941
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,380
'Okay, full out
on this rehearsal here.'

942
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:42,860
'Nice, with the legs.'

943
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,514
Then we cut to Saffron.
She sexy-walks in.

944
00:47:45,601 --> 00:47:46,907
We'll fix that later.

945
00:47:46,994 --> 00:47:48,604
Then steady-cam onto the piano

946
00:47:48,691 --> 00:47:51,694
pushing to the saloon girls.
Slide up the leg.

947
00:47:51,781 --> 00:47:53,131
And now we're doing
a Busby Berkeley.

948
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:54,262
- Busby Berkeley.
- Bugsy..

949
00:47:54,349 --> 00:47:56,047
B-Busby Berkeley.

950
00:47:56,134 --> 00:47:58,136
Then the piano flies out..
Whoosh! Good!

951
00:47:58,223 --> 00:47:59,702
Then we whip-pan
right to these guys.

952
00:47:59,789 --> 00:48:00,921
Give me that wheel kick.

953
00:48:01,008 --> 00:48:02,618
'Then we clap it. Laser focus.'

954
00:48:02,705 --> 00:48:03,663
'Now here comes Kenny.'

955
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,273
'Saffron sees him.'

956
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,885
'She's going to do
some sexy-time with the hands.'

957
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:11,149
'This is weird.
Now they kiss. Ah!'

958
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:13,586
'Now Kenny's got the lasso
finale. Okay?' The lasso..'

959
00:48:13,673 --> 00:48:15,893
'Kenny, you've got to have
that lasso spinning, Kenny.'

960
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,069
You gotta.. Oh, cut!

961
00:48:18,156 --> 00:48:19,200
'That was close, though.'

962
00:48:19,287 --> 00:48:21,115
Kenny, it-it was a mess, man.

963
00:48:21,202 --> 00:48:22,900
No, no, no, no, no,
I got, I got it, I got it.

964
00:48:22,987 --> 00:48:24,249
I just have to..

965
00:48:24,336 --> 00:48:26,294
...make the knot tighter.

966
00:48:26,381 --> 00:48:28,993
Uh, a-actually, all you gotta do
is loosen the hondu.

967
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,864
Okay, I think..

968
00:48:30,951 --> 00:48:32,692
I think I know a little bit more
about stunt-roping

969
00:48:32,779 --> 00:48:36,174
than this guy.
Right, Mr. Gymnastics?

970
00:48:36,261 --> 00:48:37,871
Hey, Kenny.

971
00:48:37,958 --> 00:48:40,047
Uh, Huck's right. You gotta..

972
00:48:40,134 --> 00:48:41,831
You gotta loosen the hondu.

973
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:43,442
Okay. Huck, could.. Huck.

974
00:48:43,529 --> 00:48:44,747
Could you come down here
and please

975
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:45,966
just do this for us, please?

976
00:48:46,053 --> 00:48:48,316
Uh, yeah, sure.

977
00:48:51,493 --> 00:48:54,148
I'm just..

978
00:48:54,235 --> 00:48:56,237
Uh, I'm just going to take it
for a second.

979
00:48:56,324 --> 00:48:58,065
Kenny?

980
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,893
Let go of the rope, Kenny.

981
00:49:01,155 --> 00:49:03,114
Like, letting go.

982
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:04,898
And you're buh-bying.

983
00:49:04,985 --> 00:49:06,247
'Thank you. Strong work, Kenny.'

984
00:49:06,334 --> 00:49:07,727
If you could just step on back.

985
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:11,949
So, whaddya- whaddya want
from him?

986
00:49:12,036 --> 00:49:13,341
Whaddya got?

987
00:49:16,257 --> 00:49:17,345
Well, uh..

988
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:18,520
Ahem.

989
00:49:18,607 --> 00:49:20,087
Usually, I like to start off

990
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:22,524
with a little bit
of a Texas Foot Stomp.

991
00:49:28,052 --> 00:49:30,619
And then, uh,
when I'm done with that

992
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:32,056
I usually like to kick it off

993
00:49:32,143 --> 00:49:34,536
with a little bit
of a Round The World.

994
00:49:34,623 --> 00:49:36,060
'Oh, yeah. I love that, yeah.'

995
00:49:36,147 --> 00:49:37,583
'Oh, yeah!'

996
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:39,672
And then I usually
like to finish things off

997
00:49:39,759 --> 00:49:41,543
by going back
into The Wedding Ring.

998
00:49:52,685 --> 00:49:54,817
He's like that girl
from the audition.

999
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:56,297
That girl wishes
she could do that.

1000
00:49:56,384 --> 00:49:58,604
Huck, buddy, that was insane.

1001
00:49:58,691 --> 00:50:01,085
Y-you keep surprising me.
I'm telling you.

1002
00:50:01,172 --> 00:50:02,956
You'd be surprised
how surprising I could be.

1003
00:50:03,043 --> 00:50:04,653
Kenny, you switch with Huck.

1004
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,395
Uh, and, Huck, let's start
with the kiss.

1005
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:10,268
What? What?

1006
00:50:10,355 --> 00:50:12,531
Okay, people, we're starting
with the kiss.

1007
00:50:12,618 --> 00:50:13,793
Yeah, big smooch. Let's do it.

1008
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,012
Right, right. We're gonna..

1009
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:16,970
Oh! Ahem! Hello.

1010
00:50:17,057 --> 00:50:19,059
Well, yeah. We're gonna..

1011
00:50:19,146 --> 00:50:21,322
What if, what if.. Hear me out.

1012
00:50:21,409 --> 00:50:23,194
What if we do the kiss, you know

1013
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:24,891
after rehearsal, you know

1014
00:50:24,978 --> 00:50:26,936
once we're saving it, you know

1015
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:29,026
for-for when the cameras
are-are rolling.

1016
00:50:29,113 --> 00:50:30,810
- You know?
- That's funny. Okay, let's go.

1017
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,334
Anytime.

1018
00:50:33,421 --> 00:50:36,076
I just, I-I-I
I don't really know if..

1019
00:50:36,163 --> 00:50:37,556
He's probably
never kissed a girl before.

1020
00:50:37,643 --> 00:50:39,210
What? No!

1021
00:50:39,297 --> 00:50:40,733
No, Kenny.

1022
00:50:40,820 --> 00:50:42,387
I have kissed..

1023
00:50:43,475 --> 00:50:45,738
...tons of, of, of girls

1024
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:47,392
ladies before.

1025
00:50:47,479 --> 00:50:49,307
Uh, like, so many.

1026
00:50:49,394 --> 00:50:51,657
So, so, so many. Uh..

1027
00:50:51,744 --> 00:50:54,703
...including my-my cousin..

1028
00:50:54,790 --> 00:50:56,444
Okay..

1029
00:50:56,531 --> 00:50:59,143
Look, look, um, I get it.

1030
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:00,796
I get it, alright?
It's weird to just

1031
00:51:00,883 --> 00:51:02,624
jump in and kiss
a total stranger.

1032
00:51:02,711 --> 00:51:04,278
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

1033
00:51:04,365 --> 00:51:06,150
That's-that's-that's
exactly what I'm saying.

1034
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:08,152
That-that is the only reason
that this is..

1035
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:09,457
That this is

1036
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:10,893
well, weird.

1037
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:12,243
'Well-well, I'd say'

1038
00:51:12,330 --> 00:51:13,983
you just do a cheat kiss.

1039
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:15,507
You don't even gotta touch.

1040
00:51:15,594 --> 00:51:17,509
A cheat kiss?
That-that's amazing.

1041
00:51:17,596 --> 00:51:18,510
Yeah, let's do,
let's do a cheat kiss.

1042
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:20,033
That's a great idea. Cheat kiss.

1043
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:21,556
That-that sounds like, uh..
we should do it.

1044
00:51:21,643 --> 00:51:23,993
- I mean, Trevor--
- No, no, no.

1045
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,691
Guys, I can't have any of that

1046
00:51:25,778 --> 00:51:26,996
fake crap on my set.

1047
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,259
I need authenticity.

1048
00:51:28,346 --> 00:51:30,130
I have to have the real deal.

1049
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:32,524
And here I am. Kiss me, Huck.

1050
00:51:32,611 --> 00:51:33,786
And you can, like ,
really go for it.

1051
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:35,962
Like, hey, totally go for it.

1052
00:51:36,049 --> 00:51:37,311
Right, right.

1053
00:51:37,398 --> 00:51:38,878
All the, all the things
you need to do.

1054
00:51:38,965 --> 00:51:40,184
- Yeah.
- I'm here for it.

1055
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:41,576
Alright, yeah.

1056
00:51:41,663 --> 00:51:43,491
Well, I'm, uh..

1057
00:51:43,578 --> 00:51:44,884
Anytime.

1058
00:51:44,971 --> 00:51:46,451
I'm gonna go for it right now.

1059
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:48,192
I'm gonna.. Kenny, your rope.

1060
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:50,411
There you go, and..

1061
00:51:50,498 --> 00:51:52,674
Trevor, I'm just gonna
go over there and, you know

1062
00:51:52,761 --> 00:51:55,503
get myself loose
so I can give it.

1063
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:57,810
I'm gonna give it to you,
so I'll be right..

1064
00:51:57,897 --> 00:51:59,333
Be right.. Oh my God!

1065
00:51:59,420 --> 00:52:00,769
What am I doing freaking out?

1066
00:52:00,856 --> 00:52:02,510
I can't do this. I just..

1067
00:52:02,597 --> 00:52:04,208
This is so..
You're fine, you're fine.

1068
00:52:04,295 --> 00:52:05,861
You're just gonna
go in there and you know..

1069
00:52:05,948 --> 00:52:08,342
Go in there and just gonna Huck
it out. Yeah, let's Huck it.

1070
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:10,257
I'll be there
in two seconds, everybody.

1071
00:52:10,344 --> 00:52:12,129
Just give me,
give me one second.

1072
00:52:12,216 --> 00:52:14,043
Just go in there, you know,
and just..

1073
00:52:14,131 --> 00:52:16,002
Okay. Oh, my God!

1074
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:18,439
Huck, just grab her
and kiss her.

1075
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:20,920
Right.

1076
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:23,966
Okay. Okay.

1077
00:52:25,881 --> 00:52:27,492
Anytime now.

1078
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,115
Oh, God..

1079
00:52:42,202 --> 00:52:43,551
That was so..

1080
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:46,511
I loved that.

1081
00:52:46,598 --> 00:52:48,382
Yeah, that was weirdly hot

1082
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:50,167
yet not hot.

1083
00:52:50,254 --> 00:52:51,603
- So we're good?
- 'Yeah.'

1084
00:52:51,690 --> 00:52:52,995
Let's do one again
for the camera

1085
00:52:53,082 --> 00:52:53,996
so they can see it.

1086
00:52:54,083 --> 00:52:55,694
Yeah!

1087
00:52:55,781 --> 00:52:58,087
- One more time?
- Anytime.

1088
00:53:09,011 --> 00:53:10,317
She's here.

1089
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:15,017
Come in!

1090
00:53:15,931 --> 00:53:18,934
Oh, hello.

1091
00:53:19,021 --> 00:53:21,241
So, this is the main house.

1092
00:53:21,328 --> 00:53:23,243
I know it very well.

1093
00:53:23,330 --> 00:53:25,506
I used to come here
all the time for coffee

1094
00:53:25,593 --> 00:53:27,204
and just to chat before..

1095
00:53:28,161 --> 00:53:29,467
...you moved in.

1096
00:53:35,429 --> 00:53:36,822
♪ Welcome to the show ♪

1097
00:53:36,909 --> 00:53:38,650
♪ One two three four ♪

1098
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:40,739
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Well, howdy, folks.

1099
00:53:40,826 --> 00:53:42,393
Hey, Billy!

1100
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:43,742
Now, sometimes,
when you're on the run

1101
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:45,134
all you want is to slow it down.

1102
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,832
A little R and R.

1103
00:53:46,919 --> 00:53:49,487
The only crime I see here
is no cutie around my arm.

1104
00:53:49,574 --> 00:53:51,140
So criminal!

1105
00:53:51,228 --> 00:53:52,925
Now, what's a guy got to do
for a little attention

1106
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:55,884
around here, huh?
What, rob somebody?

1107
00:53:55,971 --> 00:53:58,017
- He's only kidding!
- Nah.

1108
00:53:58,104 --> 00:53:59,192
The only thing
I'm here to steal tonight

1109
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:00,411
is your heart.

1110
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:08,332
Ain't you just

Oh, oh! Oh!

1121
00:54:37,796 --> 00:54:39,972
- 'Cut! Cut it, cut it, cut it!'
- 'Cut! Cut!'

1122
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:42,061
Hey, Jackson, Jackson!

1123
00:54:42,148 --> 00:54:43,454
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1124
00:54:43,541 --> 00:54:45,020
- 'Are you sure?'
- 'Yeah, yeah.'

1125
00:54:45,107 --> 00:54:46,935
Here. You lost your hat.

1126
00:54:47,022 --> 00:54:48,154
'Let's go get First Aid.'

1127
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:49,982
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1128
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:51,505
I was so worried, I..

1129
00:54:56,205 --> 00:54:57,555
Uh..

1130
00:54:59,121 --> 00:55:00,862
Well, uh..

1131
00:55:00,949 --> 00:55:03,256
You good? Yeah, you're-you're
good, pal. Right?

1132
00:55:03,343 --> 00:55:04,736
Yeah, he's good, everybody.

1133
00:55:04,823 --> 00:55:06,303
He's, uh, he's real good, folks.

1134
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:08,392
Just a big boy over here.
Let me check him.

1135
00:55:08,479 --> 00:55:10,002
Up, yeah. Yeah, ooh! Oh!

1136
00:55:10,089 --> 00:55:12,483
He's got it.
There we go. Yeah. Alright.

1137
00:55:12,570 --> 00:55:14,267
- Are you okay, buddy?
- 'We're just gonna..'

1138
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:15,877
'You know, I'm thinking,
you know what?'

1139
00:55:15,964 --> 00:55:17,575
Uh, let's just,
let's just kinda regroup.

1140
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:19,228
Let's take ten.
Let's take a break.

1141
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,274
'No, no, no, I-I feel good.'

1142
00:55:21,361 --> 00:55:22,841
'I just wanna check him out'

1143
00:55:22,928 --> 00:55:24,973
'make sure
everything's alright.'

1144
00:55:25,060 --> 00:55:27,236
Alright, I'm just gonna go.
Excuse me.

1145
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:39,205
My god, what was that?

1146
00:55:39,292 --> 00:55:40,641
"Jackson,
I was so worried about you."

1147
00:55:40,728 --> 00:55:42,339
No, you weren't worried.
You were..

1148
00:55:44,863 --> 00:55:46,821
No, no, no, no, no.

1149
00:55:46,908 --> 00:55:49,128
You are not selling my house!

1150
00:55:50,869 --> 00:55:53,219
We're not
much of a coffee family.

1151
00:55:53,306 --> 00:55:55,308
Valerian! You can't do this!

1152
00:55:57,441 --> 00:55:59,443
- Do what, Huck?
- Do, uh..

1153
00:56:00,661 --> 00:56:02,924
This, you know?
All-all of this.

1154
00:56:03,011 --> 00:56:05,971
I mean, this-this house
is amazing.

1155
00:56:06,058 --> 00:56:09,148
It amazes me that you have
decorated this all by yourself.

1156
00:56:09,235 --> 00:56:11,237
Aw, thank you, Huck.

1157
00:56:12,194 --> 00:56:13,761
I did dabble a little

1158
00:56:13,848 --> 00:56:15,850
in Interior Design.

1159
00:56:15,937 --> 00:56:18,113
Really, really, really nice.

1160
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,377
Man, if this house,
you know, with all the..

1161
00:56:20,464 --> 00:56:23,031
Well, let's just say,
if I had this house

1162
00:56:23,118 --> 00:56:24,772
I would never sell it.

1163
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:27,122
I would never,
ever, ever, ever sell it.

1164
00:56:27,209 --> 00:56:28,733
Have we met before, Huck?

1165
00:56:28,820 --> 00:56:30,561
Yeah. You look
familiar to me, too.

1166
00:56:30,648 --> 00:56:33,041
And where's that-that accent
of yours from?

1167
00:56:33,128 --> 00:56:34,608
Oh, uh..

1168
00:56:34,695 --> 00:56:36,871
You know, uh, I-I got
a real, real quick break

1169
00:56:36,958 --> 00:56:38,307
so I was just gonna
pop on in here

1170
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,352
use the restroom,
if that's alright.

1171
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:40,832
Uh, no. Ew.

1172
00:56:40,919 --> 00:56:43,617
Um, there's
portable toilets outside.

1173
00:56:43,704 --> 00:56:46,490
Alright. Yeah, yeah.
I'll go use those.

1174
00:56:46,577 --> 00:56:48,361
Got a real nice zing, though,
by the way

1175
00:56:48,448 --> 00:56:49,710
so it would have been..

1176
00:56:49,797 --> 00:56:51,016
Bye-bye.

1177
00:56:51,103 --> 00:56:52,626
Alright.

1178
00:56:52,713 --> 00:56:53,888
It's a lovely home, ain't it?

1179
00:56:53,975 --> 00:56:55,194
Oh, it sure is.

1180
00:56:59,067 --> 00:57:01,635
'So, as I was saying'

1181
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:03,768
this property has been
in the Tremaine family

1182
00:57:03,855 --> 00:57:05,639
for over a century.

1183
00:57:05,726 --> 00:57:07,815
It's practically a landmark.

1184
00:57:07,902 --> 00:57:10,122
Oh, dump it.
The sooner the better.

1185
00:57:10,209 --> 00:57:11,776
'H-h-h-hold on, hold on.'

1186
00:57:11,863 --> 00:57:13,560
If we can get landmark status

1187
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:15,040
would that add value
to the house?

1188
00:57:15,127 --> 00:57:17,521
Well, I don't know,
but it would guarantee

1189
00:57:17,608 --> 00:57:19,523
that the property
would be preserved.

1190
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,089
Oh, pfft!

1191
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:23,440
They can turn it into
a Chuck E Cheese for all I care.

1192
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:25,093
'Yeah, she-she's right.'

1193
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,139
Just get us some offers
as soon as possible, okay?

1194
00:57:29,228 --> 00:57:30,882
It breaks my heart to think

1195
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:32,927
about selling this property.

1196
00:57:33,014 --> 00:57:34,363
'I always imagined'

1197
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,104
that this house would stay

1198
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:38,237
in the family forever

1199
00:57:38,324 --> 00:57:40,326
Finley having
little babies here.

1200
00:57:41,283 --> 00:57:43,938
The thought! Um..

1201
00:57:44,025 --> 00:57:46,114
The thought is so lovely.

1202
00:57:46,201 --> 00:57:48,595
But, you know,
teenagers these days

1203
00:57:48,682 --> 00:57:50,858
they just want to get out
and see the world.

1204
00:57:50,945 --> 00:57:53,165
'Ugh..'

1205
00:57:53,252 --> 00:57:55,820
Okay! New plan.
Change. Get back in there.

1206
00:57:55,907 --> 00:57:57,996
I'm just going to go..
I'm just going to change.

1207
00:57:58,083 --> 00:57:59,911
Okay.

1208
00:57:59,998 --> 00:58:01,565
Ahem. Hello, sir. How ya doin'?

1209
00:58:01,652 --> 00:58:03,871
Just dropping this bag off
to one of the ladies, you know.

1210
00:58:04,959 --> 00:58:07,005
Alright. Okay..

1211
00:58:08,397 --> 00:58:10,791
I'm so sorry!
So, so, so sorry, Miss!

1212
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:12,663
My God! Okay..

1213
00:58:15,535 --> 00:58:17,668
Well, uh, I'm, uh,
let you two be.

1214
00:58:17,755 --> 00:58:19,321
I see
it's very occupied in there.

1215
00:58:19,408 --> 00:58:20,845
I can hold it.

1216
00:58:20,932 --> 00:58:23,543
God, that's disgusting. Oh.

1217
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:25,284
'They cannot sell this house.'

1218
00:58:29,593 --> 00:58:31,290
Excuse me. Anybody in here?

1219
00:58:31,943 --> 00:58:33,074
No?

1220
00:58:36,991 --> 00:58:38,515
Oh, my God.

1221
00:58:38,602 --> 00:58:40,342
Sell the house!
They can't sell the house.

1222
00:58:40,429 --> 00:58:42,301
I mean, she's done
some crazy things before

1223
00:58:42,388 --> 00:58:43,607
but this is just..

1224
00:58:46,653 --> 00:58:48,916
- Okay..
- 'Huck?'

1225
00:58:49,003 --> 00:58:50,831
Are you kidding me?

1226
00:58:51,876 --> 00:58:52,920
'Huck?'

1227
00:58:59,144 --> 00:59:00,362
Huck?

1228
00:59:05,759 --> 00:59:07,369
I can tell you're in here.

1229
00:59:09,633 --> 00:59:10,851
Oh.

1230
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,506
Excuse me, young man.

1231
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:15,639
Now, unless you are here
for a fitting

1232
00:59:15,726 --> 00:59:17,815
and I don't believe
that you are

1233
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:20,165
then I highly suggest
that you get on your way

1234
00:59:20,252 --> 00:59:22,384
before I have to call security
and have them escort you out.

1235
00:59:22,471 --> 00:59:24,343
Excuse me, have you seen
a man around here somewhere?

1236
00:59:24,430 --> 00:59:26,040
The only man that I see

1237
00:59:26,127 --> 00:59:29,566
is a disrespectful one
standing right in front of me.

1238
00:59:29,653 --> 00:59:32,046
'Does anyone have a 20 on Huck?'

1239
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:34,527
That means now!
Young man, go. Shoo!

1240
00:59:34,614 --> 00:59:36,311
Get out of my trailer. Shoo!

1241
00:59:36,398 --> 00:59:38,531
It's my property.
This is my property!

1242
00:59:38,618 --> 00:59:39,924
- This is my property.
- Shoo!

1243
00:59:41,882 --> 00:59:45,451
'Where's Huck?
Does anyone have a 20 on Huck?'

1244
00:59:45,538 --> 00:59:47,496
'Please, people, help me here!'

1245
00:59:49,368 --> 00:59:50,891
'Really?'

1246
01:00:02,729 --> 01:00:04,035
Yee-haw!

1247
01:00:04,122 --> 01:00:06,385
How is my favorite client today?

1248
01:00:06,472 --> 01:00:08,343
- I'm not your client, Kale.
- No. Not yet.

1249
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:11,346
But if you take a little lookie.

1250
01:00:11,433 --> 01:00:12,913
Right?

1251
01:00:14,436 --> 01:00:15,742
I mean, it-it-it is rough

1252
01:00:15,829 --> 01:00:17,875
but I think you'll see
where I'm going with it.

1253
01:00:17,962 --> 01:00:19,790
- I see something.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

1254
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:21,618
Okay, listen, um..

1255
01:00:21,705 --> 01:00:23,750
- Hey, Kale?
- Yeah, buddy?

1256
01:00:23,837 --> 01:00:25,143
Who is that girl over there?

1257
01:00:28,189 --> 01:00:29,974
'Oh, God, why?'

1258
01:00:30,061 --> 01:00:33,151
Well, I think that's the girl
from the audition, no?

1259
01:00:33,238 --> 01:00:34,631
Oh, yes. Yeah.

1260
01:00:34,718 --> 01:00:36,284
Yeah. That's Pig Girl.

1261
01:00:36,371 --> 01:00:37,938
Just a muddy little nobody.

1262
01:00:38,025 --> 01:00:39,374
Tragic, really.

1263
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:41,725
Listen, I-I-I think
I hear them calling for me.

1264
01:00:41,812 --> 01:00:43,857
Alright? You hold onto this.
I-I love the idea.

1265
01:00:43,944 --> 01:00:45,729
Wonderful work.
I'll catch up with you later.

1266
01:00:45,816 --> 01:00:46,947
I was just hoping
maybe you'd take a look

1267
01:00:47,034 --> 01:00:49,689
at this contract that I drew up.

1268
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:51,082
'Hey, hey, hey, hold on now.'

1269
01:00:51,169 --> 01:00:52,257
Hold on to this water
for me, too, bud.

1270
01:00:52,344 --> 01:00:53,737
Thanks. I'll be right with you.

1271
01:00:53,824 --> 01:00:55,042
Well, I'll hold that.
I'll be right here.

1272
01:00:55,129 --> 01:00:56,435
And she rides, too.

1273
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:57,784
You want me? Come and get me.

1274
01:00:59,177 --> 01:01:01,266
- Hold on.
- 'Come on, boy.'

1275
01:01:01,353 --> 01:01:02,746
Let's go. Come on, boy.

1276
01:01:02,833 --> 01:01:04,095
Let's go. Come on.

1277
01:01:06,271 --> 01:01:08,142
Come on, let's go. Come on. Hey.

1278
01:01:18,892 --> 01:01:20,285
Come on. Hyah! Hyah!

1279
01:01:25,246 --> 01:01:26,334
Hyah! Come on.

1280
01:01:27,596 --> 01:01:28,989
Come on, boy.

1281
01:01:29,076 --> 01:01:30,382
Hey, hey, hold up!

1282
01:01:38,825 --> 01:01:40,435
It's okay, it's okay,
it's alright.

1283
01:01:43,308 --> 01:01:44,613
Who are you?

1284
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:48,226
I think we might have
a little bit of a problem

1285
01:01:48,313 --> 01:01:50,228
with Jackson and Finley.

1286
01:01:50,315 --> 01:01:52,273
The only problem we have

1287
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,362
is that you haven't managed
to sign him yet.

1288
01:01:54,449 --> 01:01:56,277
God, mom, that is so unfair.

1289
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:57,931
He's impossible to get to.

1290
01:01:58,018 --> 01:01:59,977
He's either on set working
or hanging out with Huck.

1291
01:02:00,064 --> 01:02:01,935
I'm starting to honestly think
that those two might be..

1292
01:02:02,022 --> 01:02:03,328
...you know,
which would be very cute.

1293
01:02:03,415 --> 01:02:06,026
Um, that is totally ridiculous.

1294
01:02:06,113 --> 01:02:08,246
I happen to know
Huck is into girls

1295
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:11,031
because when he kissed me,
it was so..

1296
01:02:13,294 --> 01:02:15,775
Right. There's also something
fishy going on

1297
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:17,168
between Finley and Huck.

1298
01:02:17,255 --> 01:02:18,647
Okay.

1299
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,694
Huck would never
be interested in Finley!

1300
01:02:21,781 --> 01:02:24,001
I didn't say
Huck was interested in Finley

1301
01:02:24,088 --> 01:02:25,742
I said Jackson was.

1302
01:02:27,569 --> 01:02:30,007
Oh! Oh..

1303
01:02:30,094 --> 01:02:31,922
I don't think we need to worry

1304
01:02:32,009 --> 01:02:34,489
about the Pig Girl.

1305
01:02:34,576 --> 01:02:37,579
Okay, listen, I can only hear
one conversation at a time.

1306
01:02:37,666 --> 01:02:40,104
Does anyone have eyes
on Jackson and Huck?

1307
01:02:41,235 --> 01:02:42,454
Alright.

1308
01:02:44,108 --> 01:02:46,588
There we go, there we go.

1309
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:47,851
It's okay. Oh! Ow!

1310
01:02:49,156 --> 01:02:52,029
Come on. Come on. Attaboy.

1311
01:02:52,116 --> 01:02:54,466
Ah, she got away from us
this time.

1312
01:02:54,553 --> 01:02:57,512
That's alright.
We'll get her next time.

1313
01:02:57,599 --> 01:02:58,992
You're a good horse.

1314
01:03:01,081 --> 01:03:03,431
You're a good boy, alright?

1315
01:03:03,518 --> 01:03:05,390
You're alright. You just shied
away from that jump today.

1316
01:03:05,477 --> 01:03:07,261
It's okay.

1317
01:03:07,348 --> 01:03:08,959
'I can teach you.'

1318
01:03:09,046 --> 01:03:11,526
'You know, I had a gelding
just like you back home.'

1319
01:03:11,613 --> 01:03:13,006
How about a treat?

1320
01:03:13,093 --> 01:03:14,312
Let's get you a treat.

1321
01:03:17,054 --> 01:03:18,359
Yeah, these will do.

1322
01:03:20,927 --> 01:03:22,276
What do you say, hmm?

1323
01:03:22,363 --> 01:03:25,976
Yeah. There you go.

1324
01:03:26,063 --> 01:03:28,413
I can do almost everything,
but I can't control the weather

1325
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:31,024
so just get me
a rain-cover set ASAP.

1326
01:03:31,111 --> 01:03:32,634
- Bernie!
- Oh!

1327
01:03:32,721 --> 01:03:34,549
Okay, I've got Huck.

1328
01:03:34,636 --> 01:03:37,988
I still need a 20 on Jackson.
Trevor's been looking for you.

1329
01:03:38,075 --> 01:03:39,990
Please don't wander off
like that again, okay?

1330
01:03:40,077 --> 01:03:42,122
Yeah, I won't.
I am so sorry about that. Sorry.

1331
01:03:42,209 --> 01:03:43,907
- Go talk to him.
- Oh, everything, though..

1332
01:03:43,994 --> 01:03:45,517
- Everything is great.
- Okay.

1333
01:03:48,259 --> 01:03:50,130
- Jackson.
- Hey, where ya been?

1334
01:03:50,217 --> 01:03:52,567
Where have you been?

1335
01:03:52,654 --> 01:03:54,004
I've just been
checking out the property.

1336
01:03:54,091 --> 01:03:56,310
Mm, yeah, it's a..

1337
01:03:56,397 --> 01:03:58,617
...real nice piece of land.

1338
01:03:58,704 --> 01:04:00,401
Beautiful, you could say, yeah.

1339
01:04:00,488 --> 01:04:02,099
Yeah, real beautiful.

1340
01:04:02,186 --> 01:04:04,318
I'd like to find me
a place like this some day.

1341
01:04:04,405 --> 01:04:05,798
That would be real nice,
real nice.

1342
01:04:05,885 --> 01:04:07,365
Jackson? Huck?

1343
01:04:07,452 --> 01:04:09,323
- Mm?
- Let's huddle up.

1344
01:04:09,410 --> 01:04:11,325
I heard "Huddle up."
That's me, right?

1345
01:04:11,412 --> 01:04:12,936
You guys need me for this one?

1346
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:14,589
No, Kenny, we're fine.

1347
01:04:14,676 --> 01:04:15,982
- Yeah, let's go.
- Alright.

1348
01:04:17,027 --> 01:04:18,202
Alright.

1349
01:04:24,599 --> 01:04:26,036
Okay.

1350
01:04:26,123 --> 01:04:27,559
Ah-ah-ah!

1351
01:04:31,345 --> 01:04:33,695
The chemistry
between you two on camera..

1352
01:04:34,696 --> 01:04:37,351
...is-is-is magical.

1353
01:04:39,310 --> 01:04:41,138
It's weird.

1354
01:04:43,401 --> 01:04:46,360
So, I'm going to take
a chance on you, Huck.

1355
01:04:46,447 --> 01:04:48,449
I'm giving you the part
that I was going to give Kenny.

1356
01:04:50,538 --> 01:04:52,149
So..

1357
01:04:52,236 --> 01:04:54,629
...this is
for the big finale scene.

1358
01:04:55,456 --> 01:04:57,763
Take it.

1359
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,678
Now, we have
a company day off tomorrow

1360
01:04:59,765 --> 01:05:02,333
so you go home, you work hard,
you memorize those lines

1361
01:05:02,420 --> 01:05:04,117
and don't be late again.

1362
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:06,728
- No!
- Alright.

1363
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,817
No, no, sir, I-I won't.

1364
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,733
I promise.
This is everything to me.

1365
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,953
Well, well, you can thank
your pal, Jackson, here

1366
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:15,433
because it was his idea.

1367
01:05:17,174 --> 01:05:18,566
There it is. Good luck!

1368
01:05:18,653 --> 01:05:20,090
Bernie, shut it down.

1369
01:05:20,177 --> 01:05:21,656
- 'Okay, we are moving on.'
- See you, Trev.

1370
01:05:22,744 --> 01:05:24,050
Ahem.

1371
01:05:27,053 --> 01:05:29,099
- Jackson, uh..
- What's up?

1372
01:05:31,188 --> 01:05:32,929
Thank you.

1373
01:05:33,016 --> 01:05:35,061
I don't even know what to say.

1374
01:05:35,148 --> 01:05:36,976
No thanks needed.

1375
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:40,023
Ah, look, I-I owe you.

1376
01:05:40,110 --> 01:05:42,547
Look, you saved me from having
to do the scene with Kenny.

1377
01:05:42,634 --> 01:05:44,462
Alright?

1378
01:05:44,549 --> 01:05:46,943
Uh, I-I really shouldn't
laugh at that

1379
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:49,902
because I really feel bad
for the poor guy, you know?

1380
01:05:49,989 --> 01:05:51,512
Right.

1381
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,645
Uh..

1382
01:05:54,428 --> 01:05:55,690
Huck, y-y-your..

1383
01:05:55,777 --> 01:05:57,562
your-your mustache
is a little askew.

1384
01:06:00,173 --> 01:06:01,653
Yeah.

1385
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:02,959
Oh, um..

1386
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:10,618
You know, Huck, I, uh

1387
01:06:10,705 --> 01:06:12,011
I figured as much.

1388
01:06:19,888 --> 01:06:21,194
You did?

1389
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,066
Yeah.

1390
01:06:25,372 --> 01:06:26,983
You can't grow facial hair.

1391
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,288
So what?

1392
01:06:30,247 --> 01:06:33,032
Yeah, yeah. Uh..

1393
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,687
I-I can't grow facial hair. I..

1394
01:06:35,774 --> 01:06:37,689
Oh, it feels good to get that
off my chest, you know that?

1395
01:06:37,776 --> 01:06:39,343
- You got that.
- Alright.

1396
01:06:39,430 --> 01:06:41,258
It's 'cause I got such a,
such a babyface.

1397
01:06:41,345 --> 01:06:42,911
You know what I mean?
To get the part

1398
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,391
I had to, had to look the part

1399
01:06:44,478 --> 01:06:46,698
but, you know, you got me.

1400
01:06:46,785 --> 01:06:48,961
Well, look, you're lucky.

1401
01:06:49,048 --> 01:06:51,398
I'll tell you what, I feel like
I'm shaving this every day

1402
01:06:51,485 --> 01:06:53,183
morning, noon and night,
you know what I'm saying?

1403
01:06:53,270 --> 01:06:55,228
- One day.
- Right, right.

1404
01:06:55,315 --> 01:06:56,882
Well, I'll tell you what, look

1405
01:06:56,969 --> 01:06:59,363
your secret's safe with me.
Okay?

1406
01:06:59,450 --> 01:07:01,321
Alright. That's good news,
yeah.

1407
01:07:01,408 --> 01:07:02,583
I'll catch you later.

1408
01:07:02,670 --> 01:07:03,976
- Thank you.
- See you, bud.

1409
01:07:10,156 --> 01:07:11,462
Oh, God.

1410
01:07:12,332 --> 01:07:13,638
Oh, my God.

1411
01:07:18,556 --> 01:07:20,166
The best part is that
even though

1412
01:07:20,253 --> 01:07:22,516
the lighting was really bad
the selfie was still really good

1413
01:07:22,603 --> 01:07:23,952
and I just felt like,
I don't know--

1414
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,346
I, I am, I was gonna go
fishing tomorrow

1415
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:28,957
since, you know,
it's my day off. Sorry.

1416
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,220
You don't have a day off.

1417
01:07:31,482 --> 01:07:33,266
I meant your day off.

1418
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:35,747
- Of filming, you know?
- Oh.

1419
01:07:35,834 --> 01:07:37,009
I'll make breakfast first.

1420
01:07:37,096 --> 01:07:38,837
- I want French Toast.
- Okay.

1421
01:07:38,924 --> 01:07:40,839
Fine, whatever.
Just stop talking.

1422
01:07:40,926 --> 01:07:42,058
Okay.

1423
01:07:43,581 --> 01:07:45,626
Saffron, if the director

1424
01:07:45,713 --> 01:07:47,367
pegged you as "Talent"

1425
01:07:47,454 --> 01:07:49,152
why hasn't he given you
a bigger part?

1426
01:07:49,239 --> 01:07:50,501
Mm!

1427
01:07:50,588 --> 01:07:52,459
You don't know anything, mom.

1428
01:07:52,546 --> 01:07:55,288
This is how
the film business works.

1429
01:07:55,375 --> 01:07:58,335
Oh, I know
how monkey business works.

1430
01:07:58,422 --> 01:08:00,859
What?

1431
01:08:00,946 --> 01:08:04,123
Boys like Jackson
are only after one thing.

1432
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:05,864
That is not true!

1433
01:08:05,951 --> 01:08:07,648
What is not true?

1434
01:08:07,735 --> 01:08:09,911
How would youeven know?

1435
01:08:09,998 --> 01:08:11,696
Yes, Finley. How would you?

1436
01:08:14,873 --> 01:08:17,267
Because I, um..

1437
01:08:19,486 --> 01:08:22,185
I overheard
Jackson and Huck talking

1438
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:24,100
when they were by the barn

1439
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:25,275
and they said
the director thinks

1440
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:26,885
Saffron is really talented

1441
01:08:26,972 --> 01:08:28,495
and he wants
to make her part bigger.

1442
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:31,498
I knew it.

1443
01:08:31,585 --> 01:08:33,413
Yeah, I don't buy it.

1444
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,415
I mean, no offense,
but we've all seen you act.

1445
01:08:35,502 --> 01:08:37,069
Don't be jelly.

1446
01:08:37,156 --> 01:08:39,593
Kale, she's right.

1447
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,769
It's not about
how you play the game

1448
01:08:41,856 --> 01:08:43,902
it's about
whether or not you win.

1449
01:08:43,989 --> 01:08:46,252
Potato potato.

1450
01:08:46,339 --> 01:08:48,167
You do know
you have to say them differently

1451
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:49,690
for that phrase to work, right?

1452
01:09:09,406 --> 01:09:10,885
Do you mind if I join you?

1453
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:12,452
I'm so sorry!
I didn't know you were..

1454
01:09:14,411 --> 01:09:16,978
Um..

1455
01:09:17,065 --> 01:09:19,024
Do you know, the, uh,
the-the-the fish

1456
01:09:19,111 --> 01:09:21,461
they just they're-they're really
not biting over here at all.

1457
01:09:21,548 --> 01:09:24,029
I think if you, you know,
go up the lake a little bit

1458
01:09:24,116 --> 01:09:26,597
like way down,
it would be better.

1459
01:09:26,684 --> 01:09:29,382
Yeah, I think
I'll, uh, take my chances.

1460
01:09:32,429 --> 01:09:33,473
Great.

1461
01:09:35,606 --> 01:09:36,781
Um..

1462
01:09:37,912 --> 01:09:39,436
Okay, well, um..

1463
01:09:39,523 --> 01:09:41,002
have a, have a good day.

1464
01:09:41,089 --> 01:09:42,874
- You leaving already?
- Yeah, yeah.

1465
01:09:42,961 --> 01:09:44,658
- Is it something I said?
- No. No, no.

1466
01:09:44,745 --> 01:09:47,226
Uh, no, no you, uh, you are..

1467
01:09:47,313 --> 01:09:49,576
..fine. I, um..

1468
01:09:49,663 --> 01:09:52,405
Good luck, you know,
with, uh, everything.

1469
01:09:52,492 --> 01:09:53,841
Come on, now,
please don't go.

1470
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:56,148
I-I have to.
You know, I forgot my bait.

1471
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:57,497
You mean this bait?

1472
01:10:00,457 --> 01:10:01,545
Yup.

1473
01:10:02,328 --> 01:10:04,678
Yup, that, um..

1474
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:07,507
That'll be the one.
If you could just, you know..

1475
01:10:07,594 --> 01:10:10,815
- Just right. Yeah.
- Thank you.

1476
01:10:10,902 --> 01:10:12,295
Now you're probably wishing
you had that horse

1477
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:13,600
right about now, huh?

1478
01:10:16,429 --> 01:10:17,822
And you're probably
thinking to yourself

1479
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:19,780
"Can I outrun him?"

1480
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:21,304
I don't think so.

1481
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:22,435
Look..

1482
01:10:23,871 --> 01:10:26,004
I know it's you.

1483
01:10:26,091 --> 01:10:28,441
- It isn't me.
- Yeah, it is.

1484
01:10:28,528 --> 01:10:30,095
- No, it isn't--
- Yes, it is.

1485
01:10:30,182 --> 01:10:32,271
- No, it isn't!
- Yes, it is.

1486
01:10:32,358 --> 01:10:34,273
Fine.

1487
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:35,622
Yes, it's me.

1488
01:10:37,885 --> 01:10:39,278
I'm so embarrassed right now.

1489
01:10:39,365 --> 01:10:40,540
Embarrassed?

1490
01:10:41,454 --> 01:10:42,499
For what?

1491
01:10:43,848 --> 01:10:47,068
Sorry, do you not remember me?

1492
01:10:47,155 --> 01:10:49,245
I'm the girl
that fell flat on her face

1493
01:10:49,332 --> 01:10:51,203
when she was trying
to wrangle her pig.

1494
01:10:51,290 --> 01:10:54,337
And I thought that was
some mighty fine pig wrangling.

1495
01:10:54,424 --> 01:10:56,513
Okay. I wasn't there
to wrangle a pig.

1496
01:10:57,905 --> 01:11:00,125
I was there to get
a part in your movie.

1497
01:11:00,212 --> 01:11:01,735
Well, look.

1498
01:11:01,822 --> 01:11:04,042
You're-you're going to get
another shot.

1499
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:07,654
Yeah, a plain girl
from Dreary, Idaho

1500
01:11:07,741 --> 01:11:09,352
isn't getting another chance.

1501
01:11:11,832 --> 01:11:13,443
Man..

1502
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:15,445
Look at me. Go on.

1503
01:11:18,274 --> 01:11:20,014
There is nothing plain
about you.

1504
01:11:23,366 --> 01:11:25,063
Now, will you come sit
and fish with me?

1505
01:11:27,326 --> 01:11:29,067
I was here first, so.

1506
01:11:32,897 --> 01:11:34,942
Yeah, keep staring at me,
I'll sell you both.

1507
01:11:35,552 --> 01:11:36,901
Finley!

1508
01:11:38,424 --> 01:11:41,340
Fin-ley! Anyone home?

1509
01:11:41,427 --> 01:11:43,299
No.

1510
01:11:45,083 --> 01:11:46,258
Sorry.

1511
01:11:49,522 --> 01:11:51,307
Oh!

1512
01:11:51,394 --> 01:11:52,482
Fantastic.

1513
01:11:57,182 --> 01:11:59,837
Disgusting. Absolutely dis..

1514
01:12:01,186 --> 01:12:02,274
You.

1515
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,800
Shouldn't you be,
like, a sandwich

1516
01:12:06,887 --> 01:12:07,845
or something by now?

1517
01:12:09,847 --> 01:12:12,066
Let's get something straight,
Jon Ham, I don't like you

1518
01:12:12,153 --> 01:12:13,764
I don't like
your stupid little face..

1519
01:12:13,851 --> 01:12:15,809
Okay, calm down.

1520
01:12:15,896 --> 01:12:17,681
Bad pig. Bad pig! Bad pig!

1521
01:12:17,768 --> 01:12:20,205
Get away from me, Fatty!
Get away!

1522
01:12:22,076 --> 01:12:23,991
Hey, hey, hey, easy. Easy.

1523
01:12:32,086 --> 01:12:33,349
Oh!

1524
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:38,789
What are you smiling about?

1525
01:12:40,312 --> 01:12:41,922
You just remind me of someone.

1526
01:12:42,009 --> 01:12:44,577
Mm. A girl back home?

1527
01:12:44,664 --> 01:12:46,927
No, no.
My friend, Huck, actually.

1528
01:12:48,973 --> 01:12:50,975
Oh!

1529
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:52,803
Oh, that's, um

1530
01:12:52,890 --> 01:12:54,108
that's-that's weird.

1531
01:12:54,195 --> 01:12:55,458
Yeah, it's, uh..

1532
01:12:55,545 --> 01:12:56,546
You know, uh, I don't mean

1533
01:12:56,633 --> 01:12:57,895
that I think
you look like a boy.

1534
01:12:57,982 --> 01:12:59,766
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I did not think

1535
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:01,202
that you were saying that, no.

1536
01:13:01,289 --> 01:13:03,161
- You are a boy, right?
- I am.

1537
01:13:03,248 --> 01:13:05,206
- Yeah. I'm a girl!
- You're a girl!

1538
01:13:05,293 --> 01:13:07,470
Hold on, you've got
a piece of grass in your hair.

1539
01:13:07,557 --> 01:13:09,428
Oh, sorry. Got it?

1540
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:13,345
Yeah.

1541
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:16,435
That was, uh..

1542
01:13:16,522 --> 01:13:17,828
- That was, um..
- Weird.

1543
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:18,959
That was weird.

1544
01:13:19,046 --> 01:13:20,744
But thanks.

1545
01:13:24,008 --> 01:13:26,837
Seriously?
Where would Finley keep..

1546
01:13:28,665 --> 01:13:30,144
Oh.

1547
01:13:30,231 --> 01:13:33,191
Stupid little trusting Pig Girl.

1548
01:13:33,278 --> 01:13:34,888
Oh, bee! Bee!

1549
01:13:40,241 --> 01:13:41,765
What is your problem?

1550
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:46,204
So..

1551
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:48,336
- My-my friend.
- Mm? Huck?

1552
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:50,034
- Huck.
- Huck.

1553
01:13:50,121 --> 01:13:51,992
Yeah, no, he's, um..

1554
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:53,907
- He's amazing.
- Oh.

1555
01:13:53,994 --> 01:13:58,085
Really? He's, like, a,
like a good guy?

1556
01:13:58,172 --> 01:14:00,131
Oh, yeah. No, he's a great guy.
I meant, he's..

1557
01:14:00,218 --> 01:14:01,567
...he's an amazing actor.

1558
01:14:04,004 --> 01:14:07,704
I'm-I'm sorry.
He's, like, an amazing actor?

1559
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:09,488
Hmm.

1560
01:14:09,575 --> 01:14:12,709
You-you think that-that he's..

1561
01:14:12,796 --> 01:14:14,058
...that he's that amazing?

1562
01:14:14,145 --> 01:14:15,668
Like, he could, he could
go far or something

1563
01:14:15,755 --> 01:14:17,757
like in show business?
That, is, like..

1564
01:14:17,844 --> 01:14:20,151
That is like,
this sounds so cool.

1565
01:14:20,238 --> 01:14:21,544
Like, from you, especially..

1566
01:14:21,631 --> 01:14:25,461
- You know, from..
- Right, right.

1567
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:28,768
That's really great for-for him,
you know?

1568
01:14:28,855 --> 01:14:31,641
Yeah, I'll, uh..

1569
01:14:31,728 --> 01:14:33,425
I'll let him know
how happy you are for him.

1570
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:36,036
Yeah. Yeah, please do,
you know.

1571
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,953
Oh, God! You devil pig!

1572
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,781
Oh, God!

1573
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:43,174
Oh, God..

1574
01:14:46,307 --> 01:14:47,744
Disgusting.

1575
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:34,878
Oh, dear.

1576
01:15:38,142 --> 01:15:39,447
You know, this is
one of the best days

1577
01:15:39,535 --> 01:15:40,710
I've had in a long while.

1578
01:15:43,060 --> 01:15:44,235
Yeah.

1579
01:15:45,018 --> 01:15:46,193
Me too.

1580
01:15:49,588 --> 01:15:51,503
And, look,
I don't know about you

1581
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:53,287
but, uh, I think
I need another shot

1582
01:15:53,374 --> 01:15:54,811
at that horse race.

1583
01:15:54,898 --> 01:15:56,290
Oh.

1584
01:15:56,377 --> 01:15:58,815
I just don't think
you could keep up.

1585
01:15:58,902 --> 01:16:00,251
You're funny..

1586
01:16:00,338 --> 01:16:01,426
...and you're kinda cute.

1587
01:16:01,513 --> 01:16:02,688
Stop.

1588
01:16:03,994 --> 01:16:05,125
You know..

1589
01:16:06,431 --> 01:16:08,912
...this business..

1590
01:16:08,999 --> 01:16:10,696
...it's just filled
with people pretending

1591
01:16:10,783 --> 01:16:12,263
to be somethin'
that they ain't.

1592
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:14,961
But you..

1593
01:16:16,833 --> 01:16:17,921
...you're real.

1594
01:16:32,196 --> 01:16:33,371
Real.

1595
01:16:41,161 --> 01:16:42,119
Jackson..

1596
01:16:43,947 --> 01:16:44,991
I, um..

1597
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:48,734
I have to tell you something.

1598
01:16:53,173 --> 01:16:54,131
Um..

1599
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,135
I'm so sorry.

1600
01:16:58,222 --> 01:16:59,440
No worries.

1601
01:17:03,967 --> 01:17:05,185
Um..

1602
01:17:06,099 --> 01:17:07,405
Sorry. I'm..

1603
01:17:07,971 --> 01:17:09,712
Um..

1604
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:19,504
Is everything okay?

1605
01:17:19,591 --> 01:17:20,897
I have to go.

1606
01:17:20,984 --> 01:17:23,160
- What is it?
- I am so sorry.

1607
01:17:23,856 --> 01:17:24,988
Wait!

1608
01:17:26,685 --> 01:17:28,948
I don't even know your name!

1609
01:17:40,307 --> 01:17:41,657
'Where have you been?'

1610
01:17:44,616 --> 01:17:46,270
Okay, um..

1611
01:17:47,837 --> 01:17:49,882
Look, I can, uh,
I can, I can explain.

1612
01:17:49,969 --> 01:17:50,970
Finley..

1613
01:17:51,057 --> 01:17:53,799
...are you and Huck, like..

1614
01:17:54,887 --> 01:17:56,236
What?

1615
01:17:56,323 --> 01:17:57,673
Saffron, no.

1616
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:00,327
Finley..

1617
01:18:00,414 --> 01:18:02,155
...why don't you explain
to them?

1618
01:18:02,242 --> 01:18:03,417
Or should I say..

1619
01:18:04,418 --> 01:18:05,637
"...Huck"?

1620
01:18:05,724 --> 01:18:07,595
Why are we calling her "Huck"?

1621
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,640
Did she change her name?

1622
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:10,163
How am I related
to you people?

1623
01:18:10,250 --> 01:18:11,469
Okay, um..

1624
01:18:13,079 --> 01:18:14,820
Look, I, uh, I..

1625
01:18:14,907 --> 01:18:16,126
I messed up.

1626
01:18:16,213 --> 01:18:18,519
'Um, Valerian, I, um..'

1627
01:18:20,434 --> 01:18:23,699
I really wanted
to be in this movie, right and..

1628
01:18:23,786 --> 01:18:25,962
...the only way
that I could do that

1629
01:18:26,049 --> 01:18:27,703
was to, uh..

1630
01:18:27,790 --> 01:18:29,356
...disguise myself..

1631
01:18:30,227 --> 01:18:31,402
...as a boy.

1632
01:18:32,664 --> 01:18:35,536
Um, as-as Huck.

1633
01:18:35,623 --> 01:18:36,973
Wait!

1634
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:39,845
Finley, you're Huck?

1635
01:18:41,325 --> 01:18:42,979
Ew!

1636
01:18:43,066 --> 01:18:44,807
Oh!

1637
01:18:44,894 --> 01:18:47,723
That's why Huck didn't
ask me out after our kiss.

1638
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:49,246
- Saffron.
- 'Yeah?'

1639
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:51,074
There is no Huck.

1640
01:18:51,161 --> 01:18:54,642
Yeah, I get that, Kale.

1641
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,035
'Do you?'

1642
01:18:56,122 --> 01:18:57,645
Valerian, I'm..

1643
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:58,951
I get it if you're mad.
I didn't--

1644
01:18:59,038 --> 01:19:01,780
Finley, give me your phone.

1645
01:19:01,867 --> 01:19:05,001
- What?
- Saffron, take Finley's phone.

1646
01:19:09,266 --> 01:19:10,746
Yeah, I..

1647
01:19:11,659 --> 01:19:13,139
I need that for..

1648
01:19:13,226 --> 01:19:14,750
Ew.

1649
01:19:14,837 --> 01:19:18,057
'I am not stupid.'

1650
01:19:18,144 --> 01:19:21,147
You have been laughing at me
all this time.

1651
01:19:21,234 --> 01:19:23,410
- No, no, no, no. Valerian, I--
- Look, shut up!

1652
01:19:23,497 --> 01:19:25,021
This is what's going to happen.

1653
01:19:25,108 --> 01:19:26,849
You are going to stay..

1654
01:19:28,067 --> 01:19:29,982
...in the barn tonight..

1655
01:19:30,069 --> 01:19:32,593
...and think about all the harm

1656
01:19:32,680 --> 01:19:35,422
you have done to this family.

1657
01:19:35,509 --> 01:19:37,468
And tomorrow, we'll tell Louise

1658
01:19:37,555 --> 01:19:41,428
to take
the first offer she gets.

1659
01:19:41,515 --> 01:19:45,302
We are finally getting out
of this hell hole.

1660
01:19:45,389 --> 01:19:47,347
- Valerian.
- No, quiet!

1661
01:19:47,434 --> 01:19:50,437
You have lost all rights

1662
01:19:50,524 --> 01:19:52,135
to have a say in this.

1663
01:19:54,006 --> 01:19:56,530
Stupid little Pig Girl.

1664
01:20:04,408 --> 01:20:05,975
'Wait, who's gonna
make me dinner?'

1665
01:20:21,207 --> 01:20:23,296
It's okay. Okay.

1666
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:44,883
Dad.

1667
01:21:14,086 --> 01:21:15,827
Okay.

1668
01:21:15,914 --> 01:21:17,220
Okay..

1669
01:21:35,368 --> 01:21:36,717
You're kidding me.

1670
01:21:38,415 --> 01:21:39,764
Keys.

1671
01:21:47,076 --> 01:21:48,599
Has anyone seen Huck?

1672
01:21:50,296 --> 01:21:52,037
Okay, all departments

1673
01:21:52,124 --> 01:21:54,997
does anyone have a 20 on Huck?

1674
01:21:55,084 --> 01:21:56,041
'Negative at the camera trucks.'

1675
01:21:56,128 --> 01:21:57,825
Dammit!

1676
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,262
Oh, where is he?

1677
01:22:00,219 --> 01:22:01,481
Hi!

1678
01:22:05,529 --> 01:22:08,227
Got it...got it.

1679
01:22:10,055 --> 01:22:11,404
'Anyone have eyes on Huck?'

1680
01:22:12,797 --> 01:22:14,930
Not in Wardrobe.

1681
01:22:15,017 --> 01:22:16,496
I think it needs to be tighter.

1682
01:22:21,284 --> 01:22:22,372
Hmm.

1683
01:22:22,459 --> 01:22:23,416
Okay, go to Circus

1684
01:22:23,503 --> 01:22:24,809
check inside his trailer.

1685
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,419
- Who's over at Catering?
- 'Uh, Cam.'

1686
01:22:26,506 --> 01:22:28,030
Yeah. Both of you, just check.

1687
01:22:28,117 --> 01:22:29,466
You realize this is your job

1688
01:22:29,553 --> 01:22:30,771
to know where he is at all
times, right?

1689
01:22:30,858 --> 01:22:32,121
'Okay, Bernie.'

1690
01:22:32,208 --> 01:22:34,775
- Well?
- Nothing.

1691
01:22:34,862 --> 01:22:36,560
- Well, try his cell.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

1692
01:22:36,647 --> 01:22:37,735
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1693
01:22:52,706 --> 01:22:54,795
Uh, Bernie! Bernie! Bernie!

1694
01:22:54,882 --> 01:22:56,928
I have an idea for you.
Uh, It's a good one.

1695
01:22:57,015 --> 01:22:58,974
Have you heard of Jon Ham..
Excuse me.

1696
01:22:59,061 --> 01:23:01,454
- What?
- Uh, hi. Jon Ham Bacon?

1697
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:03,413
Well, we've been
thinking about expanding.

1698
01:23:03,500 --> 01:23:05,589
Jackson's onboard.
I'm his manager, by the way.

1699
01:23:05,676 --> 01:23:07,025
I'm his manager.

1700
01:23:08,244 --> 01:23:09,723
- Hi!
- Hello.

1701
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:12,291
Snack.

1702
01:23:12,378 --> 01:23:14,032
Hello!

1703
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:17,731
Anyone? Hello?

1704
01:23:17,818 --> 01:23:19,951
It doesn't do a bird's-eye,
the thing doesn't make sense

1705
01:23:20,038 --> 01:23:21,257
and that's what I'm saying..

1706
01:23:21,344 --> 01:23:22,432
Did you find him?

1707
01:23:22,519 --> 01:23:23,824
Went to voicemail.

1708
01:23:31,876 --> 01:23:33,617
- Go get Kenny.
- Yeah.

1709
01:23:36,185 --> 01:23:37,751
I need, uh..

1710
01:23:37,838 --> 01:23:39,927
I'm going to need
some sort of, um, sandwich.

1711
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,190
I'm going to need a sandwich.

1712
01:23:41,277 --> 01:23:42,669
Agh!

1713
01:23:49,894 --> 01:23:51,026
You need me?

1714
01:23:51,852 --> 01:23:53,028
Yeah.

1715
01:23:54,072 --> 01:23:55,856
Yeah, I need you, Kenny.

1716
01:23:55,943 --> 01:23:57,902
Yes!

1717
01:23:59,947 --> 01:24:01,079
Oh..

1718
01:24:09,435 --> 01:24:10,654
You show up there.

1719
01:24:10,741 --> 01:24:12,047
You got some chocolate
on there.

1720
01:24:12,134 --> 01:24:13,178
Let's get rid of that.

1721
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:17,791
Morning, y'all..

1722
01:24:17,878 --> 01:24:19,054
- Morning.
- What's going on?

1723
01:24:20,577 --> 01:24:22,405
Well, looks like
we get to do our scene

1724
01:24:22,492 --> 01:24:24,668
together after all, buddy.

1725
01:24:24,755 --> 01:24:25,799
And how's that?

1726
01:24:28,759 --> 01:24:29,934
Where's Huck?

1727
01:24:30,891 --> 01:24:32,154
He didn't show.

1728
01:24:32,241 --> 01:24:33,242
We can't reach him.

1729
01:24:35,331 --> 01:24:36,810
So, we're going to go
with Kenny.

1730
01:24:36,897 --> 01:24:38,029
Mm-hmm.

1731
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,423
We gotta shoot.

1732
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:41,815
I understand, Bernie.

1733
01:24:41,902 --> 01:24:43,861
Oh, this is your chance!

1734
01:24:43,948 --> 01:24:45,384
Really?

1735
01:24:45,471 --> 01:24:47,343
- Get over there.
- Really?

1736
01:24:47,430 --> 01:24:49,475
Don't blow it again.

1737
01:24:51,608 --> 01:24:52,957
You're very hard on her.

1738
01:24:56,395 --> 01:24:58,354
- Hi!
- Hi..

1739
01:24:58,441 --> 01:24:59,659
Howdy, howdy, howdy.

1740
01:24:59,746 --> 01:25:01,139
Oh. Ew.

1741
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:02,967
Listen, now is really
not the time.

1742
01:25:03,054 --> 01:25:04,795
Oh, but, um..

1743
01:25:04,882 --> 01:25:06,188
...I heard that you wanted
to make my part bigger..

1744
01:25:06,275 --> 01:25:07,276
...and yes.

1745
01:25:07,363 --> 01:25:08,625
I'm sorry, what?

1746
01:25:08,712 --> 01:25:10,105
No, no, that's right,
that's right.

1747
01:25:10,192 --> 01:25:12,019
You mentioned that.
Uh, you guys discuss

1748
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:13,325
that right now, alright?
I'm gonna go..

1749
01:25:13,412 --> 01:25:15,284
You're not. Don't do this to me.

1750
01:25:15,371 --> 01:25:17,808
Jackson.

1751
01:25:25,468 --> 01:25:26,512
What?

1752
01:25:27,818 --> 01:25:29,124
Are you..

1753
01:25:30,777 --> 01:25:32,127
What is that?

1754
01:25:33,867 --> 01:25:35,391
Again, I want to say

1755
01:25:35,478 --> 01:25:37,175
thank you to all of the locals

1756
01:25:37,262 --> 01:25:38,872
who showed up today,
ready to work

1757
01:25:38,959 --> 01:25:41,005
as Background Artists.

1758
01:25:41,092 --> 01:25:42,833
My mom would like
to discuss the game plan

1759
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:44,443
for selling the property.

1760
01:25:44,530 --> 01:25:45,879
Things have changed, and..

1761
01:25:45,966 --> 01:25:48,708
Uh, shh! I-I can't hear
the nice lady.

1762
01:25:48,795 --> 01:25:51,189
We're just waiting
on one more cast member.

1763
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:52,364
Hey, Huck?

1764
01:25:57,021 --> 01:25:58,153
Huck, where you at?

1765
01:26:07,727 --> 01:26:09,729
Jon Ham!

1766
01:26:09,816 --> 01:26:11,427
Yes! Good boy, Jon Ham!

1767
01:26:11,514 --> 01:26:14,256
Good boy! Good boy!
You got it, you got it!

1768
01:26:14,343 --> 01:26:17,172
Easy. Good boy, good boy,
come on!

1769
01:26:17,259 --> 01:26:18,956
Thank you!

1770
01:26:22,525 --> 01:26:23,917
Jon Ham..

1771
01:26:24,004 --> 01:26:25,745
...youare my hero.

1772
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:28,835
It's showtime.

1773
01:26:31,360 --> 01:26:33,188
- I got Jackson!
- Okay, we got Jackson.

1774
01:26:33,275 --> 01:26:35,102
Okay, good. Let's do this, then.

1775
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:36,191
Trevor, are we really
shooting this?

1776
01:26:36,278 --> 01:26:37,496
Yeah, I'm sorry, buddy.
We gotta.

1777
01:26:37,583 --> 01:26:39,150
- We gotta, we gotta.
- Okay.

1778
01:26:39,237 --> 01:26:41,021
'Actors to first position,
please.'

1779
01:26:47,985 --> 01:26:49,029
Yes!

1780
01:26:50,553 --> 01:26:51,728
And..

1781
01:26:52,946 --> 01:26:53,947
...action!

1782
01:26:55,906 --> 01:26:58,169
Everything you said was a lie.

1783
01:26:59,431 --> 01:27:01,781
It may've been a lie, Billy..

1784
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,480
...but..

1785
01:27:04,567 --> 01:27:06,438
Uh, but, uh..

1786
01:27:08,048 --> 01:27:09,833
I am so sorry, I, I..

1787
01:27:09,920 --> 01:27:11,095
Can I get the line?
Can we go back?

1788
01:27:11,182 --> 01:27:12,749
I forgot, I forgot the line.

1789
01:27:12,836 --> 01:27:14,794
- Going again!
- 'Sorry.'

1790
01:27:27,242 --> 01:27:28,721
And..

1791
01:27:28,808 --> 01:27:29,853
...action!

1792
01:27:32,159 --> 01:27:34,336
Everything you said was a lie.

1793
01:27:35,511 --> 01:27:36,816
Oh..

1794
01:27:36,903 --> 01:27:39,341
It may have been a lie,
Billy. but..

1795
01:27:39,428 --> 01:27:40,559
Oh!

1796
01:27:42,344 --> 01:27:43,997
Aah!

1797
01:27:44,084 --> 01:27:45,042
I think that's broken.

1798
01:27:49,133 --> 01:27:50,874
- That was close.
- Ooh!

1799
01:27:50,961 --> 01:27:53,442
Don't touch him. He's fine.

1800
01:27:53,529 --> 01:27:55,357
Your, uh, your-your tooth.

1801
01:27:56,358 --> 01:27:57,359
Gone.

1802
01:27:59,448 --> 01:28:00,710
Is it noticeable?

1803
01:28:02,842 --> 01:28:04,931
- Let's go again.
- Go.. Uh..

1804
01:28:05,018 --> 01:28:06,281
- He's missing a tooth.
- I don't care.

1805
01:28:06,368 --> 01:28:09,022
We didn't establish teeth.
Get him up!

1806
01:28:09,109 --> 01:28:10,894
Okay, let me go again.

1807
01:28:10,981 --> 01:28:12,635
- Up you go.
- 'Up I go.'

1808
01:28:12,722 --> 01:28:14,767
Yup. Oh, Kenny's alright.

1809
01:28:14,854 --> 01:28:17,466
Coach, we're okay.

1810
01:28:17,553 --> 01:28:19,032
I-I got this.
I'll just go again.

1811
01:28:19,119 --> 01:28:20,425
'Okay.'

1812
01:28:20,512 --> 01:28:21,948
I'm going to make you proud!

1813
01:28:22,035 --> 01:28:24,081
'Okay. Ooh, I feel good.'

1814
01:28:24,168 --> 01:28:25,996
- Okay, we should go.
- Okay, let's go, then.

1815
01:28:26,083 --> 01:28:27,345
Here we go, and rolling.

1816
01:28:27,432 --> 01:28:28,955
Rolling!

1817
01:28:30,522 --> 01:28:31,480
Action.

1818
01:28:31,567 --> 01:28:33,612
Everything you said was a lie.

1819
01:28:41,490 --> 01:28:43,274
- We got this, we got this.
- This isn't going to work.

1820
01:28:43,361 --> 01:28:44,406
It's going to work.

1821
01:28:45,145 --> 01:28:46,321
Ugh..

1822
01:28:46,930 --> 01:28:48,845
No.

1823
01:28:48,932 --> 01:28:50,150
'Should we cut?'

1824
01:28:50,237 --> 01:28:51,587
No, we're not going to cut.

1825
01:28:51,674 --> 01:28:53,240
Give him the line again, please.

1826
01:28:53,328 --> 01:28:55,286
- Really?
- Yes. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

1827
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:56,505
Okay. Uh..

1828
01:28:58,637 --> 01:29:01,423
Everything you said was a lie.

1829
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:03,207
'It may have been
a lie, Billy..'

1830
01:29:07,733 --> 01:29:09,300
It's all been a lie.

1831
01:29:12,956 --> 01:29:15,306
But I never meant to hurt you.

1832
01:29:15,393 --> 01:29:16,742
What's going on with his voice?

1833
01:29:19,005 --> 01:29:21,486
I should have told you

1834
01:29:21,573 --> 01:29:22,792
at the lake.

1835
01:29:24,315 --> 01:29:26,970
Lake? What lake? What lake?

1836
01:29:27,057 --> 01:29:29,451
Right, we shoulda..

1837
01:29:29,538 --> 01:29:32,454
We shoulda talked at the lake.

1838
01:29:32,541 --> 01:29:34,064
But I was too afraid to.

1839
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,067
I was..

1840
01:29:37,154 --> 01:29:38,764
...too scared of..

1841
01:29:41,201 --> 01:29:42,551
...what might happen.

1842
01:29:44,248 --> 01:29:45,597
Is he taking off his clothes?

1843
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:48,905
But I am sick

1844
01:29:48,992 --> 01:29:51,081
and tired..

1845
01:29:51,168 --> 01:29:52,778
...of being afraid.

1846
01:29:55,868 --> 01:29:57,566
You know our friend, Huck..

1847
01:29:59,045 --> 01:30:00,743
...he made me realize

1848
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:03,398
that I could either
stay invisible..

1849
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:07,314
...or I could be remarkable.

1850
01:30:09,099 --> 01:30:11,406
So, if coming clean..

1851
01:30:12,581 --> 01:30:14,234
...means losing everything..

1852
01:30:21,807 --> 01:30:23,940
...then it just wasn't
in the cards.

1853
01:30:27,639 --> 01:30:28,771
Who are you?

1854
01:30:32,601 --> 01:30:33,776
That's a good question.

1855
01:30:35,778 --> 01:30:38,041
Some people call me "Pig Girl."

1856
01:30:39,956 --> 01:30:42,088
My daddy, though, he called me
"Princess."

1857
01:30:45,483 --> 01:30:49,139
All I know is that
I have got one chance..

1858
01:30:49,226 --> 01:30:51,663
...and even if I end up
with mud on my face

1859
01:30:51,750 --> 01:30:53,360
I am going to take it.

1860
01:30:56,625 --> 01:30:57,582
Jackson..

1861
01:30:59,366 --> 01:31:01,499
I'm so sorry
that I didn't tell you sooner.

1862
01:31:03,066 --> 01:31:04,023
Um..

1863
01:31:06,809 --> 01:31:08,201
This is a lot to take in.

1864
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:10,508
Yeah, I know.

1865
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:14,556
Can you forgive me?

1866
01:31:17,036 --> 01:31:18,211
I don't know.

1867
01:31:28,918 --> 01:31:30,659
And cut!

1868
01:31:30,746 --> 01:31:32,574
Yes!

1869
01:31:32,661 --> 01:31:34,140
'Okay, I don't know
what that was.'

1870
01:31:34,227 --> 01:31:35,794
I don't know what that was,
but I'm loving that.

1871
01:31:35,881 --> 01:31:37,666
I am.. Oh!

1872
01:31:37,753 --> 01:31:38,928
You..

1873
01:31:39,015 --> 01:31:40,320
...are extraordinary.

1874
01:31:42,192 --> 01:31:44,150
I thought you were a.. Um..

1875
01:31:44,237 --> 01:31:45,761
- But you're a, you're a--
- 'Girl!'

1876
01:31:45,848 --> 01:31:48,024
- Yeah.
- A badass girl.

1877
01:31:48,111 --> 01:31:49,591
'I knew it!'

1878
01:31:49,678 --> 01:31:50,896
I knew there was something
weird about--

1879
01:31:50,983 --> 01:31:52,681
Shut up, Kenny.

1880
01:31:52,768 --> 01:31:54,552
I'm gonna put you
in my next movie.

1881
01:31:55,553 --> 01:31:56,772
The one starring Jackson.

1882
01:31:59,383 --> 01:32:01,167
You're not putting her anywhere.

1883
01:32:05,694 --> 01:32:08,261
You can't stop me from going,
Valerian.

1884
01:32:08,348 --> 01:32:10,481
Well, I guess if you want
to say goodbye..

1885
01:32:10,568 --> 01:32:12,048
...to your childhood home.

1886
01:32:14,703 --> 01:32:16,705
And the first thing to go..

1887
01:32:16,792 --> 01:32:19,142
...will be that little pig.

1888
01:32:19,229 --> 01:32:21,361
Straight to the slaughterhouse.

1889
01:32:23,363 --> 01:32:25,148
I don't really think
that you would do that.

1890
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:29,413
Because I think
that there is a heart

1891
01:32:29,500 --> 01:32:31,110
in there somewhere, Valerian.

1892
01:32:34,374 --> 01:32:36,159
- For crying out loud. Louise?
- 'Yeah?'

1893
01:32:36,246 --> 01:32:38,335
Please.

1894
01:32:38,422 --> 01:32:40,076
- 'Louise?'
- Yes?

1895
01:32:42,600 --> 01:32:45,081
We'll take the first offer
you get.

1896
01:32:46,996 --> 01:32:50,042
Well, I'd have to get the
owner's approval to do that.

1897
01:32:50,129 --> 01:32:51,348
I just gave it to you.

1898
01:32:51,435 --> 01:32:53,132
'Oh, well, after our meeting..'

1899
01:32:53,219 --> 01:32:55,134
I did some digging
and it turns out

1900
01:32:55,221 --> 01:32:59,138
that Mr. Tremaine left
the property to his daughter.

1901
01:32:59,225 --> 01:33:01,401
He left it to me?

1902
01:33:01,488 --> 01:33:02,620
Not you.

1903
01:33:02,707 --> 01:33:04,187
His real daughter.

1904
01:33:04,274 --> 01:33:05,884
So, you'd have to ask her.

1905
01:33:11,586 --> 01:33:12,848
Is that true, Louise?

1906
01:33:12,935 --> 01:33:13,892
It is.

1907
01:33:15,807 --> 01:33:16,982
So, you're saying..

1908
01:33:17,069 --> 01:33:18,723
You've got squat.

1909
01:33:21,247 --> 01:33:22,684
Ahh..

1910
01:33:22,771 --> 01:33:25,208
I want this more than anything.

1911
01:33:27,166 --> 01:33:28,254
You guys have no idea

1912
01:33:28,341 --> 01:33:31,170
but I, I can't leave my farm

1913
01:33:31,257 --> 01:33:32,476
my animals, my home--

1914
01:33:32,563 --> 01:33:34,826
Hold on now.

1915
01:33:34,913 --> 01:33:36,523
I might be able to help you out
there.

1916
01:33:36,611 --> 01:33:38,830
- Hey, Trev?
- 'Yeah?'

1917
01:33:38,917 --> 01:33:39,918
Come here, bud.

1918
01:33:40,005 --> 01:33:41,616
What's up?

1919
01:33:41,703 --> 01:33:42,965
Look, I got...

1920
01:33:43,052 --> 01:33:44,662
I got good news
and I got bad news.

1921
01:33:44,749 --> 01:33:46,446
- Okay.
- Bad news is..

1922
01:33:46,533 --> 01:33:47,926
...you're gonna have to find a
new lead for your film.

1923
01:33:48,013 --> 01:33:49,058
Uh, excuse me?

1924
01:33:49,145 --> 01:33:50,059
The good news is...

1925
01:33:51,321 --> 01:33:52,714
Huck here is your star.

1926
01:33:54,454 --> 01:33:55,673
My name's Finley.

1927
01:33:57,457 --> 01:33:59,198
Now, that is a great name.

1928
01:33:59,285 --> 01:34:01,244
Think that really is.

1929
01:34:01,331 --> 01:34:03,376
Well, you know, it was written
for a male.

1930
01:34:03,463 --> 01:34:05,552
- It-it's an action film.
- Right.

1931
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:07,903
But I'm thinking right now

1932
01:34:07,990 --> 01:34:10,688
that it would be so much better
with a female.

1933
01:34:10,775 --> 01:34:12,385
Finley.

1934
01:34:12,472 --> 01:34:13,822
Geez.

1935
01:34:13,909 --> 01:34:15,954
- I'm making calls.
- Okay.

1936
01:34:18,435 --> 01:34:19,479
And, Miss Finley

1937
01:34:19,566 --> 01:34:22,004
if it was okay by you..

1938
01:34:22,091 --> 01:34:23,309
Hm..

1939
01:34:23,396 --> 01:34:25,572
I could hang back

1940
01:34:25,660 --> 01:34:27,662
look after your farm.

1941
01:34:27,749 --> 01:34:29,576
Keep them horses in shape.

1942
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:31,970
You know, since my step-family

1943
01:34:32,057 --> 01:34:34,016
won't be living here anymore..

1944
01:34:35,757 --> 01:34:37,715
I will need someone
to look after Jon Ham.

1945
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,414
Right. Hey, Kale?

1946
01:34:41,501 --> 01:34:43,765
Yeah, buddy. Yeah.

1947
01:34:43,852 --> 01:34:45,505
Listen, I won't be needing
a manager anymore

1948
01:34:45,592 --> 01:34:48,421
but if you're interested

1949
01:34:48,508 --> 01:34:51,163
I will need someone to shovel
Jon Ham's poop.

1950
01:34:52,861 --> 01:34:54,166
I see.

1951
01:34:54,253 --> 01:34:55,167
Alrighty then.

1952
01:34:58,170 --> 01:34:59,868
- I'm not picking up poop.
- No..

1953
01:34:59,955 --> 01:35:01,913
- You're picking up poop.
- I'm not picking up pig poop.

1954
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:04,568
'You're supposed to fix this,
Kale.'

1955
01:35:04,655 --> 01:35:05,700
You know, uh..

1956
01:35:06,744 --> 01:35:09,268
I could take off after you..

1957
01:35:09,355 --> 01:35:10,705
finish shooting
your movie.

1958
01:35:11,923 --> 01:35:12,837
Hmm.

1959
01:35:14,143 --> 01:35:15,057
Yeah..

1960
01:35:17,363 --> 01:35:18,321
...or not.

1961
01:35:20,584 --> 01:35:21,759
Or not.

1962
01:35:23,718 --> 01:35:25,241
