I'm so happy I found this spot.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.352
-I just moved here.
-To New York?

01:42.435 --> 01:45.897
No, to the Bronx.
I got priced out of my old neighborhood.

01:45.980 --> 01:48.525
Oh, I hear you.
Same thing's been happening here.

01:49.025 --> 01:52.612
You know, they offered me
a stupid amount of money for my salon.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.489

I'm not married, Frank.
I don't have a boyfriend either.

It's your girl Gloria, live,

04:47.036 --> 04:49.205
and catch that tan
while you can, you heard?

04:49.289 --> 04:52.041
Oh, and if you see a kid that's riding
a bike two sizes too big for him,

04:52.625 --> 04:56.087
that's just Lil Mayor trying
to save the neighborhood all by himself.

04:56.587 --> 04:58.298
Oh, and speaking
of saving the neighborhood,

04:58.381 --> 05:00.383
what's up
with all these missing person flyers?

05:00.466 --> 05:02.844
I thought this new construction
was supposed to make it safer.

Listen, I appreciate
what you're trying to do,

05:24.198 --> 05:27.952
-but to be real… [speaking Spanish]
-No, don't say that. This is gonna work.

King Arthur for his sword?

[chuckles]

05:40.298 --> 05:42.925
Let it go? That junk's going on eBay

05:43.509 --> 05:44.886
Can you put this on my tab?

05:44.969 --> 05:46.137
And this on your tab.

-Yeah, I already know.

Yeah, your boy said
he was gonna hook us up

06:23.800 --> 06:25.385

06:35.311 --> 06:36.145
Hey, hold up!

Um, I'll see about the VIP. Just…

06:40.525 --> 06:44.362
contribute something to the bodega fund.
it's important for the community.

06:45.446 --> 06:46.906

Nah.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.215
Why are you ignoring me?

07:04.298 --> 07:06.509
It seems like she knows you.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.137
No, that's just some random lady.

07:09.220 --> 07:13.224

you don't want me to call a babysitter?

Bruh, they, like, 16.
They were not feeling us.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.076
They'd be feelin' us
if we had some cash, man.

07:32.160 --> 07:35.079
-We wouldn't look so broke.
-Yo, what the hell is this?

07:35.663 --> 07:37.623

07:40.543 --> 07:41.919
Everybody's cashing out.

07:42.503 --> 07:45.047
It's all about getting
that macchiato and gelato money.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.007

-[Gloria] Yeah!
-Damn, girl. What the hell?

08:12.992 --> 08:15.203
What's wrong with you?
You almost gave us a heart attack.

08:15.286 --> 08:18.664
-That's how people get shot in the hood.
-You ain't shooting nobody, Lil Mayor.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.042
-Bobby, on the other hand…
-Shut up, Gloria.

Okay, Bobby got into a minor,

09:34.824 --> 09:37.326
minor altercation in biology, and…

09:39.036 --> 09:41.706
-Father Jackson kicked him out of school.
-You got kicked out?

09:41.789 --> 09:43.583
-Damon started it.
-You're only telling me now?

09:43.666 --> 09:44.959
We didn't want you to worry.

09:45.042 --> 09:47.753
Listen, you worry too much.
I mean, look at yourself.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.338
You're eating your hand off.

09:49.839 --> 09:52.133
This is it. It's finally happened.

09:52.633 --> 09:53.843
I'm out of the crew.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.387
Everything's different now.
Miguel's a politician.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.389
Bobby's voice changed all of a sudden.

09:58.472 --> 09:59.849
He sounds like Denzel now.

Bobby, I ain't heard from you.
We doing this, or what?

10:19.243 --> 10:21.746
Nah. I'm good for now.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.791
All right.
You change your mind, you let me know.

10:27.752 --> 10:28.669
Hey, hey, hey, yo.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.964
Those are nice, son. What size are they?

10:32.632 --> 10:34.091
Uh… nine.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.011
That's a little tight,
but I think we can make it work.

All right, boys. I'll be seeing you.

I said no. That's it.

-…heart. They'll disintegrate.

24:47.903 --> 24:49.112
[grunts]

24:49.196 --> 24:50.614
You know those little round cookies

24:50.697 --> 24:52.908
that don't taste
like anything they give out at church?

24:52.991 --> 24:54.534
You mean the Eucharist?

24:54.618 --> 24:57.496
You little heathen. If you was at church
once in a while, you'd know that.

24:57.579 --> 25:00.790
Put one of those Eucharists
in a vampire's mouth, and he's toast.

25:00.874 --> 25:01.875
All right.

25:01.958 --> 25:03.585
Also garlic. What about that?

25:03.668 --> 25:05.921
-Nah, that's not a thing.
-Yes, a thing.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.923
Garlic is a vampire repellent.

25:08.006 --> 25:09.925
Same with the crucifix.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.718
Holy water is a repellent as well,

25:11.801 --> 25:14.763
but you can also use it
as a vampire detector

25:14.846 --> 25:17.557
because holy water boils
when a vampire is close.

25:17.641 --> 25:19.059
What are you guys talking about?

25:19.142 --> 25:20.602
-Vampires.
-Nothing.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.854
Y'all really shouldn't be messing
with that kinda stuff.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.149
-[door chimes]
-[Tony] Welcome to Primo Bodega.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.943
Big sexy. [speaking Spanish]

25:28.026 --> 25:29.945
That's it.
It's happening right in front of us.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.656
A vampire can only enter
your place if he's invited.

25:32.739 --> 25:36.368
Tony let the vampire in last night
when he said, "Welcome to Primo Bodega."

25:36.451 --> 25:39.704
[whispers] Right, right.
Okay, okay. They can't enter bodega.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.331
-All right.
-No, no.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.708
[quietly]
They need an invitation to enter,

25:43.792 --> 25:46.628
and it's not only a bodega.
It can be like a house or something.

25:47.254 --> 25:51.258
A message from me. You tell him
it's open season on all suckheads.

25:51.341 --> 25:53.260
Okay. [breathing fast]

25:57.264 --> 26:00.350
I don't like that look.
You're about to say something stupid.

26:02.435 --> 26:03.812
[sinister music playing]

26:06.022 --> 26:07.816
We are not going in there.

26:07.899 --> 26:08.817
It's daytime.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.944
Nothing to worry about.
They're all asleep, right?

26:11.027 --> 26:12.571
I've gotta be out of my mind.

26:12.654 --> 26:16.491
Come on, guys. We need proof.
We got this. We're Blades.

26:29.170 --> 26:31.256
-Hello.
-May I help you?

26:31.339 --> 26:35.093
Yes, I'd like to talk to your manager
about a sponsorship opportunity.

26:36.052 --> 26:37.137
Seriously?

26:38.763 --> 26:39.681
Um…

26:40.807 --> 26:41.808
Here.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.146
Is this your business card?

26:47.480 --> 26:48.440
It's for charity.

26:59.951 --> 27:00.952
Are you insane?

27:01.036 --> 27:04.414
-We need to get out of here right now.
-I'm looking for evidence.

27:04.497 --> 27:07.417
You know, I think
you're putting way too much faith in shit

27:07.500 --> 27:09.002
that he read in a comic book.

27:09.502 --> 27:11.212
It's a graphic novel.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.631
[whispering] Shut up.

27:12.714 --> 27:13.882
[keyboard clattering]

27:17.093 --> 27:17.927
Come on.

27:22.390 --> 27:24.017
He'll be with you in a moment.

27:24.100 --> 27:25.185
He will?

27:26.811 --> 27:27.729
[clicks]

27:27.812 --> 27:29.272
[shades rolling]

27:38.198 --> 27:40.033
[breathing heavily]

27:42.702 --> 27:43.662
[gasps]

27:48.750 --> 27:50.710
The afternoon sun can be murder.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.382
Frank Polidori. Pleasure to meet you.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.259
You too.

27:59.427 --> 28:00.679
Step into my office.

28:18.947 --> 28:19.823
[locks]

28:25.286 --> 28:27.122
So, what can I do for you boys?

28:29.499 --> 28:31.251
Well, we're, um…

28:32.210 --> 28:35.588
doing this event to benefit Tony's bodega,

28:35.672 --> 28:36.548
and…

28:37.340 --> 28:40.051
-We need some sponsorship--
-[Frank] I'm gonna stop you right there.

28:43.596 --> 28:45.056
How's $2,000 sound?

28:46.015 --> 28:48.393
-You serious?
-[Frank] You know, you're right.

28:49.644 --> 28:50.645
Let's make it three.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.523
You know, Murnau…

28:53.606 --> 28:57.652
is very committed to making the Bronx
the best place it can be for all of us.

28:59.446 --> 29:02.073
That's very thoughtful of you.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.200
To put it bluntly,

29:04.701 --> 29:07.036
this place is a forgotten area.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.497
Every last one of you could disappear,

29:10.957 --> 29:13.126
and no one would even notice.

29:15.712 --> 29:17.422
Although, I gotta say,

29:17.505 --> 29:20.175
not everyone appreciates
what we're trying to do here.

29:21.342 --> 29:23.553
Would you believe someone glued a flyer

29:24.053 --> 29:25.597
just like this to our sign

29:25.680 --> 29:26.973
outside the courthouse?

29:27.974 --> 29:29.017
[knocking]

29:31.019 --> 29:33.480
You boys wouldn't know
anything about that now, would you?

29:34.773 --> 29:36.357
No, no, no.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.650
-[knocking]
-[thudding]

29:37.734 --> 29:38.693
[Miguel] Luis?

29:38.777 --> 29:41.154
-What's going on here?
-[Miguel] He has low blood sugar.

29:41.237 --> 29:44.032
-Maybe we should call his mom.
-Nobody leaves this room.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.284
But he's gonna…

29:46.868 --> 29:48.620
-[knocking]
-Hey.

29:49.996 --> 29:51.414
What are you guys doing here?

29:52.373 --> 29:54.417
[gasps] Oh, my gosh. Are you okay?

29:54.501 --> 29:55.460
[Luis moans]

29:55.543 --> 29:56.503
Well…

29:56.586 --> 29:57.629
Um…

29:57.712 --> 29:59.422
I'm suddenly feeling much better.

29:59.506 --> 30:03.468
We were just talking to Mr. Polidori
about sponsoring the block party, and--

30:03.551 --> 30:06.012
You really should. These kids are great.

30:06.095 --> 30:08.932
We have an appointment.
I'm sorry. My mind is…

30:09.015 --> 30:11.434
Okay, well, thank you.
Nice seeing you. Nice meeting you.

30:11.518 --> 30:12.977
We really must be going.

30:13.061 --> 30:13.895
Let's go.

30:13.978 --> 30:17.148
Um… [chuckles]
Thank you for the very generous donation.

30:18.358 --> 30:20.235
[smacks lips] It'll really help. Oh.

30:20.318 --> 30:21.694
[suspenseful music playing]

30:22.487 --> 30:24.322
-[Bobby] Go! Go!
-[Miguel] Watch out!

30:34.374 --> 30:35.875
What the hell is this?

30:38.628 --> 30:40.880
A massive vampire nest.

30:40.964 --> 30:44.008
Thirteen floors. Twelve coffins per floor.

30:44.092 --> 30:46.553
-That's 300 and--
-One hundred fifty-six vampires.

30:46.636 --> 30:48.179
-[Gladys] Bobby!
-Close enough.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.138
What?

30:50.139 --> 30:52.851
Uh-uh. Don't you talk to me like that.

30:52.934 --> 30:54.936
I ought to smack you upside the head.

30:55.937 --> 30:57.146
And you, too.

30:57.230 --> 30:58.565
You ain't fooling nobody.

30:58.648 --> 31:00.108
I know what you doing.

31:01.317 --> 31:02.652
I'mma check your cookies.

31:03.236 --> 31:04.863
[Bobby] Where you going, Mom?

31:04.946 --> 31:06.948
I'm going to see that man
at the real estate company.

31:07.031 --> 31:08.449
Frank Polidori.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.661
He came by last night,
wanted to know if we were selling!

31:11.744 --> 31:13.663
Uh, you can't talk to him.

31:13.746 --> 31:14.998
What the hell you doing?

31:15.081 --> 31:18.585
-Don't go there, Ma.
-He's… he's a really bad man.

31:19.085 --> 31:21.045
Of course he is. He's in real estate,

31:21.129 --> 31:23.089
but as long as his money is also real,

31:23.172 --> 31:24.799
-I'm gon' hear him out.
-Why?

31:26.467 --> 31:27.802
Where'd you get that hat?

31:28.803 --> 31:29.637
Bought it.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.599
Psss.
Henny better not have given that to you.

31:33.725 --> 31:35.476
I see what he's trying to do.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.104
Trying to pull you down
the same road to hell as your daddy.

31:39.147 --> 31:41.900
This Frank Polidori,
he's gon' get us out of this house,

31:41.983 --> 31:44.068
keep you away from that life.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.238
[Miguel] Miss Gladys, please trust us.

31:47.322 --> 31:48.239
Don't go there.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.493
But we gon' leave
this mess before you screw up.

31:54.704 --> 31:58.416
Y'all can go back
to your nudie search. Hmm.

32:01.377 --> 32:03.671
-[exhales]
-So, Henny gave you that hat?

32:04.464 --> 32:05.298
So?

32:05.381 --> 32:07.759
There are plans
for dozens of buildings here.

32:07.842 --> 32:08.676
[clicking]

32:09.886 --> 32:11.971
I… I say we take all this to the cops.

32:12.055 --> 32:13.640
-We can't.
-He's right.

32:13.723 --> 32:16.309
-Not enough evidence.
-Not what I thought you'd say.

32:16.392 --> 32:20.104
If you don't already believe in vampires,
you're not gonna believe in this.

32:20.188 --> 32:21.481
We need something more.

32:22.148 --> 32:23.858
We need something no one can deny.

32:24.901 --> 32:26.486
We need to find the nest.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.405
Also, I stole this,
so we should chill with the cop talk.

32:34.535 --> 32:35.578
Don't touch that.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.461
[ringing]

32:43.544 --> 32:45.880
Why isn't your phone on vibrate?

32:45.964 --> 32:47.215
Who are you?

32:47.298 --> 32:50.176
What's poppin', y'all? This is GloTV.
It looks like they got things started

32:50.259 --> 32:53.179
at the courthouse. They got mad movers,
and it looks hella fancy in there.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.223
Like, they got chandeliers.
Let's check it out.

32:55.723 --> 32:57.934
Excuse me. What's in those boxes?

32:58.601 --> 33:00.186
[mover] Uh, Sub-Zeros.

33:00.937 --> 33:04.565
[Gloria] They trying to tell me
these big-ass boxes are Sub-Zero fridges.

33:04.649 --> 33:06.484
Damn, these condos
are gonna be nice as hell.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.902
Let me guess.

33:07.986 --> 33:09.237
They ain't refrigerators.

33:10.029 --> 33:11.614
I think we just found the nest.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.117
[Gloria] Yo, am I bugging,
or do these boxes look like coffins?

33:14.200 --> 33:15.326
[indistinct chatter]

33:17.662 --> 33:19.080
[suspenseful music playing]

33:30.633 --> 33:31.467
Come on.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.682
[door rattling]

33:37.765 --> 33:38.725
Yo, it's locked.

33:45.314 --> 33:46.649
[glass shattering]

33:53.281 --> 33:54.782
[squeaking]

34:17.638 --> 34:21.017
-[whispers] Hey, check out the footprints.
-[Bobby] Word, bro.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.143
[Luis] Mm-hm.

34:22.226 --> 34:25.063
[Miguel] This is it.
This is definitely it.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.566
This is bad. This is definitely bad.

34:30.276 --> 34:31.277
[door opens]

34:54.926 --> 34:57.678
Can we please… can we please just go?

34:58.429 --> 35:00.389
Can we just get our asses outta here?

35:03.684 --> 35:05.812
Don't do it, man. Don't--

35:05.895 --> 35:06.896
Shh.

35:31.587 --> 35:33.923
And we're prying the coffins open.

35:34.757 --> 35:36.134
Seems unnecessary.

35:37.468 --> 35:38.511
[squeaking]

35:42.098 --> 35:43.432
Whoa.

35:47.687 --> 35:49.564
-Told you.
-We got it. Can we just go?

35:49.647 --> 35:52.984
This is the same dude who killed Slim.
I remember his stupid-ass clothes.

35:53.067 --> 35:54.110
[phone ringing]

35:57.280 --> 35:59.282
-[Luis] Go!
-Oh, my God!

35:59.907 --> 36:00.992
-Go!
-[roars]

36:01.075 --> 36:02.285
[roaring]

36:03.619 --> 36:04.537
What?

36:07.456 --> 36:09.083
[growls]

36:09.167 --> 36:10.042
[screaming]

36:10.126 --> 36:10.960
Get out!

36:11.043 --> 36:12.795
-Open the door!
-[vampire growls]

36:12.879 --> 36:13.754
[Miguel] Go!

36:13.838 --> 36:15.089
[dramatic music playing]

36:18.467 --> 36:19.552
[growling]

36:27.476 --> 36:28.394
[Luis] Go! Go!

36:28.477 --> 36:29.896
[panting]

36:29.979 --> 36:30.897
Huh-huh.

36:31.814 --> 36:33.566
Yo. We got 'em.

36:34.192 --> 36:37.653
Yo, Bobby, how you not mute your phone?
You almost killed us in there.

36:37.737 --> 36:40.573
[police siren blaring]

36:42.575 --> 36:44.327
You three are in deep shit.

36:44.994 --> 36:48.289
Great plan, Lil Mayor.
I told you cops wouldn't help for shit.

36:48.873 --> 36:49.874
Excuse me?

36:50.458 --> 36:53.211
Um, Sanders,
it sounds like they want to go to juvie.

36:53.961 --> 36:55.838
We expected more from you, Lil Mayor.

36:56.714 --> 36:57.840
[police siren blaring]

37:04.805 --> 37:05.640
Um…

37:06.140 --> 37:07.308
What are we doing here?

37:07.391 --> 37:09.977
We need to see if Mr. Polidori's
gonna press charges on you three.

37:11.103 --> 37:13.981
-Could this day get any worse?
-Yes.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.485
[speaking Spanish]

37:17.568 --> 37:19.695
What is wrong with you? Huh?

37:19.779 --> 37:21.322
[upbeat music playing]

37:21.405 --> 37:23.574
[indistinct shouting continues]

37:23.658 --> 37:26.369
What's poppin'? It's your girl Gloria.
We are live and at the scene,

37:26.452 --> 37:27.912
so let me give you all the deets.

37:27.995 --> 37:31.916
Lil Mayor and his little friends
got caught up with 5-0 for trespassing.

37:31.999 --> 37:33.417
Such fine boys, aren't they?

37:33.501 --> 37:37.505
[speaking Spanish]

37:37.588 --> 37:40.299
His mom had been on him
about some dirty-ass underwear,

37:40.383 --> 37:42.134
and now he's in the back of a police car.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.970
I bet this was your idea, huh?

37:44.053 --> 37:47.139
You broke in. How could you do this?
You know how hard I work?

37:47.223 --> 37:52.186
This man got some real crazy
Illuminati conspiracy theories

37:52.270 --> 37:55.106
to drop with him and his boys,
and I'm ready for it.

37:55.189 --> 37:59.068
[speaking Spanish]

37:59.151 --> 38:01.529
Lil Mayor's about to say wild shit.
Let's go see what he say.

38:01.612 --> 38:04.365
Okay, I know how this looks,
but just trust me.

38:04.448 --> 38:06.909
Everything will make sense
after you see this.

38:09.996 --> 38:10.830
See that?

38:12.331 --> 38:13.749
That's the vampire nest.

38:13.833 --> 38:15.876
Inside the courthouse.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.336
Now, brace yourselves.

38:17.420 --> 38:19.297
This is the part
when I open up the coffin.

38:19.797 --> 38:22.800
[Luis] Can we please…
can we please just go?

38:24.385 --> 38:26.595
[Miguel] Whoa!

38:27.263 --> 38:30.016
-Uhh, what we supposed to be seeing?
-[phone ringing on recording]

38:31.267 --> 38:32.852
-Vampires.
-[crowd] What?

38:32.935 --> 38:34.186
-Vampires?
-What?

38:34.270 --> 38:35.146
[laughing]

38:35.229 --> 38:36.355
[man] Come on.

38:36.439 --> 38:37.815
[chuckling]

38:37.898 --> 38:40.776
-That's wild, bro.
-Lil Mayor, what you smoking, man?

38:40.860 --> 38:42.320
-You got some more?
-[crowd laughing]

38:42.403 --> 38:43.821
I don't understand.

38:44.447 --> 38:45.781
Vampires don't have souls.

38:48.451 --> 38:49.910
They don't have a reflection.

38:50.536 --> 38:53.539
You can't see them
in mirrors, photos, or videos.

38:53.622 --> 38:55.458
Know what?
Forget the video. We have their plans

38:55.541 --> 38:57.918
to build deadly vampire nests
all over this neighborhood.

38:58.002 --> 38:59.337
Have a look at this.

39:00.421 --> 39:01.672
Where'd you get this?

39:02.465 --> 39:04.842
Okay, we may have borrowed it,

39:04.925 --> 39:08.554
but I'd gladly give it
back to Mr. Polidori if…

39:09.055 --> 39:10.806
and only if he comes out here

39:10.890 --> 39:12.683
and proves he's not a vampire.

39:14.935 --> 39:16.228
Ah, kids.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.941
They have the most wild imaginations.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.611
I caught these three
trespassing at the courthouse,

39:23.694 --> 39:25.821
and they confessed to stealing your file.

39:26.572 --> 39:28.324
[Tony] Hey, hey, hold on a second.

39:28.407 --> 39:30.785
I can vouch for these kids, bro.
They're good kids.

39:30.868 --> 39:33.579
They were just mixed up
with some crazy vampire idea. That's all.

39:33.662 --> 39:36.874
Well, the file has been returned.
I suppose no harm was done.

39:36.957 --> 39:37.792
Right, boys?

39:38.376 --> 39:39.835
No need to make this a legal matter.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.504
[woman] Thank you so much.

39:41.587 --> 39:42.505
We're so sorry.

39:42.588 --> 39:44.840
-We don't know what got into our boys.
-Boys will be boys.

39:44.924 --> 39:46.884
[speaking Spanish]

39:46.967 --> 39:48.719
[speaking Spanish]

39:48.803 --> 39:50.721
What is wrong with you? Are you crazy?

39:50.805 --> 39:53.682
I bet this was all your idea.
You're gonna end up like your daddy.

39:53.766 --> 39:56.060
Who you looking at? Answer me!

39:56.143 --> 39:57.186
Come on. Let's go.

39:57.269 --> 39:59.397
[chuckling]

39:59.480 --> 40:00.606
[officer] Thank you.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.735
Hey, hey, hey, Carmen. [speaking Spanish]

40:04.819 --> 40:06.654
You let him watch Blade, didn't you?

40:06.737 --> 40:08.030
Blade? What's that?

40:09.156 --> 40:11.742
I am Blade! Vampires…

40:12.368 --> 40:13.411
watch out!

40:13.494 --> 40:14.662
He paid for it.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.747
So that's
how he's getting these crazy ideas?

40:16.831 --> 40:18.874
You're not going
to that bodega ever again.

40:18.958 --> 40:20.418
What? No, no, Mom.

40:20.501 --> 40:23.254
-Ma, Tony didn't do anything.
-[speaking Spanish]

40:23.337 --> 40:25.756
Go with your mother.
Listen to her. She knows best, all right?

40:25.840 --> 40:27.341
-I know best.
-Forget the vampire stuff.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.261
[Miguel speaking Spanish]

40:30.344 --> 40:31.720
[melancholy music playing]

40:41.605 --> 40:42.940
[man singing in Spanish]

40:59.373 --> 41:00.207
[honks]

41:28.152 --> 41:29.278
Commander.

41:34.658 --> 41:37.912
We're going to church to set you right.
And clean up this room!

41:50.508 --> 41:51.467
Yo, open that gate.

41:55.054 --> 41:57.056
[squeaking]

42:08.692 --> 42:10.819
[Frank] Henny, my man.
Thanks for meeting me.

42:11.862 --> 42:14.240
What's this business opportunity
you got for me?

42:14.740 --> 42:17.284
So, my employer has become concerned

42:17.368 --> 42:19.828
that people
in the neighborhood aren't responding…

42:19.912 --> 42:22.414
expeditiously enough
to our financial proposals.

42:23.290 --> 42:24.792
So, I need you to make some…

42:26.377 --> 42:28.712
let's just call it "noise"
in the neighborhood.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.422
Disturbances significant enough

42:30.506 --> 42:33.259
to give the last holdouts
the push they need to sell.

42:33.342 --> 42:35.803
Yeah. I ain't interested
in any police attention.

42:35.886 --> 42:39.974
'Cause it would negatively impact your
business. I understand that. I can dig it.

42:41.016 --> 42:41.892
However,

42:42.560 --> 42:44.645
what I'm prepared to offer you tonight…

42:46.605 --> 42:49.984
is more money for a couple of days' work
than you've made in your entire life.

42:56.991 --> 42:57.825
That's right.

43:01.370 --> 43:04.415
Additionally, there's a matter
of a small piece of personal property

43:04.498 --> 43:07.668
that's been stolen from us
by a group of neighborhood boys.

43:09.044 --> 43:10.796
We'd like the stolen items returned

43:11.589 --> 43:12.881
and the perpetrators…

43:14.508 --> 43:15.342
eliminated.

43:19.513 --> 43:20.598
[phone ringing]

43:31.150 --> 43:31.984
[operator] You--

43:33.444 --> 43:34.361
[phone ringing]

43:35.738 --> 43:37.156
Yo, why you ignoring me?

43:37.239 --> 43:38.991
-What? I called you.
-[Miguel] Luis?

43:39.074 --> 43:42.411
Yeah. Listen.
I figured it out. Dude is their familiar.

43:42.494 --> 43:43.495
Who is their what?

43:44.079 --> 43:47.207
Frank. The creepy real estate guy.
He's the vampires' familiar.

43:47.291 --> 43:51.086
-What is that? Like, a sun vampire?
-[Luis] No.

43:51.170 --> 43:53.005
A familiar is a human servant

43:53.088 --> 43:55.924
who protects his undead master
during the daylight hours.

43:56.008 --> 44:00.262
He does a vampire's bidding in exchange
for eventually becoming a vampire himself.

44:00.346 --> 44:03.724
He's making all the deals in the daytime
while the vampires sleep in the nest.

44:03.807 --> 44:05.309
-Exactly.
-[Carmen] Miguel!

44:05.392 --> 44:06.727
[speaking Spanish]

44:06.810 --> 44:08.896
-You going to church tonight?
-[Luis] Yes.

44:08.979 --> 44:11.231
Titi's convinced
I'm possessed by el diablo.

44:11.315 --> 44:14.109
El diablo! That's right.
That's why he's going to church tonight.

44:14.193 --> 44:16.362
God will save him. The Lord will help him.

44:16.445 --> 44:18.614
[speaking Spanish]

44:19.990 --> 44:20.824
Told you.

44:20.908 --> 44:22.534
See you there. I got a plan.

44:23.035 --> 44:24.536
[phone ringing]

44:25.746 --> 44:26.830
[Bobby] Come on, man.

44:27.539 --> 44:28.457
[sighs]

44:28.540 --> 44:29.583
[knocking]

44:35.464 --> 44:36.799
Sup, little man?

44:36.882 --> 44:39.635
Hey, look, you better go
before my mom spots you.

44:39.718 --> 44:42.429
I got something.
Set you and your moms up real nice.

44:43.180 --> 44:46.517
-Yeah, I don't know.
-I'm trying to help you, bruh.

44:46.600 --> 44:49.186
You run out the money your pops left,
kicked out of school.

44:49.269 --> 44:51.063
You gon' keep playing
with your little friends,

44:51.146 --> 44:54.441
or you gon' finally grow up,
be the man of the house, get some respect?

44:55.109 --> 44:55.984
[phone ringing]

45:01.824 --> 45:04.410
-What?
-Meet me and Luis at church right now.

45:04.493 --> 45:06.954
-No.
-I have a plan to take out these vampires.

45:07.037 --> 45:07.871
But we need you!

45:07.955 --> 45:08.997
[Henny] Last chance.

45:09.081 --> 45:10.416
I ain't asking again.

45:10.499 --> 45:13.001
-[Miguel] Yo, is that Henny?
-That your boy Miguel?

45:13.085 --> 45:14.336
Let me holla at him.

45:14.920 --> 45:16.588
-I gotta go.
-[Miguel] No! Bobby, don't!

45:16.672 --> 45:19.174
-You know how this is gonna end with him.
-[Bobby] End with him?

45:19.758 --> 45:20.592
What about with you?

45:21.176 --> 45:23.929
In the last day, you got me
into more shit than Henny ever could.

45:24.513 --> 45:26.807
I'm done with all this.
And I'm done with you!

45:29.017 --> 45:30.227
[church bell rings]

45:30.686 --> 45:31.603
[Luis] Yo, Miguel.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.609
-Bobby coming?
-No.

45:38.110 --> 45:38.944
He's with Henny.

45:40.821 --> 45:43.365
But, uh… we can do this without him.

45:44.241 --> 45:45.868
And what is it we're doing?

45:46.744 --> 45:48.120
Well, well, well…

45:50.873 --> 45:52.583
lost lambs returning to the flock.

45:52.666 --> 45:55.127
I don't see you two
at Thursday mass very often.

45:55.627 --> 45:56.545
Uh…

45:56.628 --> 46:01.216
It's tough with our responsibilities
in the community and so forth and--

46:01.300 --> 46:03.844
Right, right, right.
And where's the other one? Hm?

46:05.304 --> 46:08.724
The one that likes to start melees
and fraternizes with known drug dealers?

46:08.807 --> 46:09.892
He couldn't make it.

46:12.186 --> 46:13.979
So, can we, uh…

46:15.105 --> 46:16.648
please go?

46:16.732 --> 46:17.691
Oh…

46:18.609 --> 46:19.568
By all means.

46:24.364 --> 46:25.866
I'll be watching you two.

46:26.992 --> 46:27.868
Closely.

46:29.286 --> 46:30.537
[indistinct chatter]

46:34.208 --> 46:35.375
[organ playing]

46:46.094 --> 46:47.346
Miguel.

46:51.391 --> 46:52.684
What are we doing?

46:52.768 --> 46:53.602
Shh.

47:01.360 --> 47:02.528
[phone vibrates]

47:12.246 --> 47:13.247
[phone vibrating]

47:18.460 --> 47:19.878
[Spanish music playing]

47:21.547 --> 47:22.381
[door chimes]

47:22.965 --> 47:25.050
Hey, how you doing?
Welcome to Primo Bodega.

47:25.133 --> 47:26.134
How can I help you?

47:28.470 --> 47:30.931
Is this the famous bodega
Lil Mayor's trying to save?

47:31.014 --> 47:33.016
Yes, it is. You know Miguel?

47:34.101 --> 47:36.520
-Doesn't everybody?
-[Tony] Yeah, it's true.

47:36.603 --> 47:39.273
Actually, I want to help out
with the block party.

47:39.356 --> 47:41.525
I was thinking of making maple scones.

47:42.109 --> 47:43.819
-Maple scones?
-[Vivian] Yeah.

47:44.319 --> 47:45.821
Yeah, that's a dope idea.

47:45.904 --> 47:48.949
-[chuckles] Is it lame?
-No, nah.

47:49.032 --> 47:50.492
Maple scones are dope.

47:50.576 --> 47:53.453
[chuckles] Is, uh… is he around?

47:53.954 --> 47:55.998
Miguel? Nah, man, that boy is bugging.

47:56.081 --> 47:58.917
I taught him way better than that.
I practically raised them boys, man.

47:59.001 --> 48:00.294
-I didn't know that.
-Yeah, man.

48:00.377 --> 48:03.255
When their parents were working,
they were here in the bodega, hanging out,

48:03.338 --> 48:06.592
doing homework, playing video games,
staying out of trouble.

48:06.675 --> 48:08.218
Are you a baseball fan?

48:08.719 --> 48:09.761
Oh, this right here?

48:09.845 --> 48:14.933
This is the bat that Sammy Sosa,
the pride of San Pedro de Macorís,

48:15.017 --> 48:18.061
used to hit 60 home runs in one season.

48:18.145 --> 48:20.564
-Wow.
-Which had only been done four times

48:20.647 --> 48:23.150
in the history of baseball.
You know how old baseball is?

48:23.233 --> 48:25.027
-It's old as shit.
-[chuckles]

48:25.110 --> 48:28.196
But that was before he started bleaching
his skin, looking like Count Chocula

48:28.280 --> 48:30.908
and one of these vampires
that Miguel thinks is in the neighborhood,

48:30.991 --> 48:32.492
sucking on people's necks.

48:32.576 --> 48:33.660
I heard about that.

48:33.744 --> 48:34.786
[Tony] Yeah.

48:34.870 --> 48:37.581
But, yeah.
Check out the store. Peruse my wares,

48:37.664 --> 48:40.250
you know?
I got some new stuff. I got some kale.

48:40.334 --> 48:43.378
I got another type of kale,
some flaxseeds.

48:43.462 --> 48:45.380
You know? Some organic aloe,

48:45.464 --> 48:46.965
whatever you need, you know?

48:47.049 --> 48:48.258
I just need this.

48:48.342 --> 48:49.843
-That's it? Just the hummus?
-Uh-hm.

48:49.927 --> 48:51.678
Okay. Um…

48:52.387 --> 48:53.972
You know what? On the house.

48:54.056 --> 48:55.098
Real talk?

48:55.182 --> 48:57.893
Yeah. You coming through with scones,
I come through with hummus.

48:58.977 --> 48:59.937
Thank you.

49:00.646 --> 49:03.523
I can see why Miguel
thinks this place is so special.

49:04.107 --> 49:07.569
Let me get you a bag. I don't want you
walking around with bare hummus.

49:09.905 --> 49:11.156
[sinister music playing]

49:15.953 --> 49:17.287
[whispers] What the…?

49:22.250 --> 49:23.251
I'm out of bags.

49:24.336 --> 49:26.338
I guess I'll see you at the block party.

49:27.839 --> 49:28.757
Mm-hm.

49:29.758 --> 49:30.759
Oh, uh…

49:31.635 --> 49:33.053
Tell Miguel I'm looking for him.

49:33.136 --> 49:34.805
-[door chimes]
-Okay.

49:40.394 --> 49:41.436
[clattering]

49:41.520 --> 49:42.437
[dialing]

49:42.521 --> 49:43.563
[ringing]

49:43.647 --> 49:45.399
You've reached Lil Mayor.
Leave a message.

49:46.233 --> 49:49.194
Yo, shorty really is a vampire, dog.
I looked at the thing--

49:49.277 --> 49:50.737
[dial tone beeping]

49:51.738 --> 49:52.614

50:19.307 --> 50:20.559

You'll never get them.

[Father] The body of Christ.

50:44.041 --> 50:45.292
The body of Christ.

50:47.711 --> 50:48.920
The body of Christ.

50:49.463 --> 50:51.048
[whispers] I got my eye on you.

50:54.259 --> 50:55.385
The body of Christ.

50:57.012 --> 50:57.971
The body of Christ.

51:03.643 --> 51:04.895
Let's all pray.

51:10.358 --> 51:11.193
[Miguel] Hey.

51:15.864 --> 51:17.115
[upbeat music playing]

51:36.134 --> 51:37.886
This is like a top-five sin.

51:39.304 --> 51:40.597
[Miguel] Yes! Holy water.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.066
How do we get it out of here?

52:09.209 --> 52:10.043
There we go.

52:14.464 --> 52:15.298

-[upbeat music stops]
-Shh. Someone's coming.

52:32.107 --> 52:33.733
Those shits stole my Sprite.

52:34.526 --> 52:36.236
[upbeat music resumes]

52:40.532 --> 52:43.785
We got the holy water,
the Eucharist, and now-- Oh.

52:45.412 --> 52:46.913
Hey, hi. Hi, Rita. Hey.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.957
I saw you two going into the sacristy.

52:49.541 --> 52:52.043
-What were y'all doing back there?
-What? No. Um…

52:52.127 --> 52:54.171
-We were busy doing…
-We were trying--

52:54.254 --> 52:55.881
-…church stuff.
-Yes.

52:55.964 --> 52:56.923
[Miguel] Church stuff.

52:57.007 --> 52:59.176
-Why are you two carrying those bottles?
-This? Oh--

52:59.259 --> 53:00.093
I have…

53:00.177 --> 53:01.761
-low blood sugar.
-Low blood sugar.

53:03.221 --> 53:04.806
-Can I have some?
-[both] No!

53:04.890 --> 53:05.849
No, you shouldn't.

53:05.932 --> 53:08.185
See, y'all better tell me
what's really going on here

53:08.268 --> 53:09.978
before I get Father Jackson out here.

53:11.688 --> 53:12.522
Um…

53:15.066 --> 53:16.610
You're gonna think I'm crazy.

53:17.444 --> 53:18.570
Try me.

53:19.779 --> 53:20.697
Okay.

53:21.448 --> 53:22.657
[rap music playing]

53:26.119 --> 53:27.078
So…

53:28.496 --> 53:30.248
we talked about me doing, like…

53:31.166 --> 53:32.792
messenger-type stuff.

53:33.668 --> 53:34.586
We did.

53:35.212 --> 53:37.547
Then, do we really need all of this?

53:39.341 --> 53:41.468
What'd you think this was gonna be, bruh?

53:42.385 --> 53:44.971
You wanna be in business,
be a big man and get paid,

53:45.055 --> 53:46.306
this what it looks like.

53:53.396 --> 53:54.231
[gun cocks]

53:55.982 --> 53:57.484
Don't try telling me I'm good.

54:04.407 --> 54:07.661
Aight, we going
to every store on the block tonight.

54:07.744 --> 54:10.247
If they open, rob whoever's
at the register. If they ain't,

54:10.330 --> 54:12.249
smash the place up,
loot it up, shoot it up.

54:12.332 --> 54:14.626
-Frank wants 'em wrecked.
-Frank?

54:15.085 --> 54:16.169
We working for Frank?

54:16.670 --> 54:19.547
-Like, the Murnau guy?
-Yeah, you got a problem with that?

54:21.383 --> 54:22.384
Nah.

54:23.218 --> 54:24.052
Come here.

54:27.305 --> 54:29.057
Got a special job for you.

54:29.849 --> 54:31.726
Where Lil Mayor
and that Puerto Rican kid at?

54:31.810 --> 54:33.853
-Why you need to know?
-[Henny] Why I need to know?

54:35.063 --> 54:36.606
This ain't a democracy, son.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.567
I tell you what I need,
and you give it to me, understand?

54:40.944 --> 54:41.778
Yeah.

54:43.446 --> 54:44.906
Now, find out where they at.

54:47.325 --> 54:48.243
Strap up.

54:52.455 --> 54:53.498
Um…

54:53.790 --> 54:55.625
I gotta use the bathroom real quick.

54:56.626 --> 54:58.253
[man] Boy piss his pants already?

[thuds]

55:19.065 --> 55:20.275
[bottles rattling]

55:22.360 --> 55:25.238
-Vampires? Are you serious?
-I know how it sounds, but--

55:25.322 --> 55:27.073
No, I'm saying,
are you seriously out at night

55:27.157 --> 55:28.742
when there's vampires running around?

55:28.825 --> 55:32.162
It's actually five vampires
based on the number of coffins we saw.

55:32.245 --> 55:33.788
So, do you believe me?

55:33.872 --> 55:34.831
We're Haitian, man.

55:34.914 --> 55:37.751
My grandma's been preparing me
for this my entire life.

55:37.834 --> 55:40.003
How you think I knew
why nothing was in your videos?

55:40.086 --> 55:42.130
We're gonna need some garlic
and some wooden stakes

55:42.213 --> 55:43.340
right the hell now.

55:43.423 --> 55:45.842
Hey, what happened to Tony's?

55:49.387 --> 55:50.305
Oh, no.

55:53.808 --> 55:54.809
Let's pull it off.

55:55.810 --> 55:56.686
[grunts]

55:58.605 --> 55:59.481
[Bobby] Hey.

56:02.025 --> 56:03.193
What you doing here?

56:03.276 --> 56:05.570
Helping you. What you think?

56:05.653 --> 56:07.197
Oh, no. I thought you was with Henny.

56:07.280 --> 56:08.907
Turn up like your dad,
shot in the streets.

56:08.990 --> 56:09.824
Yo!

56:10.367 --> 56:11.451
Don't talk about my pops.

56:12.035 --> 56:14.537
While you was off playing gangsta,
them vampires got Tony.

56:14.621 --> 56:16.581
Yo! What are you two doing?

56:17.082 --> 56:18.875
We're supposed to be best friends.

56:21.628 --> 56:23.338
Um… are y'all done?

56:23.421 --> 56:26.216
Because I'd like to get inside
before vampires try to eat us.

56:26.299 --> 56:27.425
Can y'all open the damn door?

56:30.303 --> 56:31.262

[ominous music playing]

56:57.205 --> 56:58.623
Oh, my God.

57:03.253 --> 57:06.131
Maybe… maybe they just took him.

57:06.214 --> 57:08.466
Vampires don't take hostages.

57:12.971 --> 57:13.930
[cries]

57:17.183 --> 57:18.309
This is my fault.

57:19.727 --> 57:21.521
I mixed Tony up in this.

57:21.604 --> 57:22.981
I brought them in here.

57:25.150 --> 57:26.151
Don't say that.

57:27.068 --> 57:27.986
Listen, man.

57:28.570 --> 57:29.571
It's not your fault…

57:31.072 --> 57:31.906
at all.

57:34.826 --> 57:35.785
Guys.

57:36.369 --> 57:38.288
Uh, look who just rolled up on us.

57:40.248 --> 57:42.625
Yo, we gotta go.
Henny's working for Murnau,

57:43.084 --> 57:44.711
and Frank hired him to find you.

57:44.794 --> 57:46.045
My God, one night with you guys,

57:46.129 --> 57:48.256
and I already have vampires
and thugs trying to kill me?

57:48.339 --> 57:49.215
Let's go.

57:51.092 --> 57:51.968
I see you.

57:53.887 --> 57:55.305
[suspenseful music playing]

58:01.978 --> 58:03.062
Holy shit.

58:04.105 --> 58:05.106
[door opens]

58:09.194 --> 58:10.153
This way.

58:15.825 --> 58:18.411
Vivian. There's vampires out there.
Come with us.

58:18.495 --> 58:19.329
Come.

58:24.959 --> 58:26.961
A little early for Halloween, ain't it?

58:27.462 --> 58:28.630
What y'all supposed to be?

58:32.425 --> 58:35.261
Why don't you four little freaks
empty your pockets for us?

58:40.141 --> 58:41.017

59:24.102 --> 59:25.436
Luis, Bobby…

59:27.230 --> 59:29.816
Call your mother and your tía.
They're worried sick.

59:32.485 --> 59:33.570
[speaking Spanish]

59:34.988 --> 59:36.489
Call your mom too. Okay?

59:36.990 --> 59:39.534
[exhales]
I'm so sorry for whatever they did.

59:39.617 --> 59:42.370
Oh, they didn't do anything wrong.
I was just bringing them home.

59:42.453 --> 59:44.372
[Carmen] Oh. Wow.

59:44.455 --> 59:47.250
-First time for everything.
-[Vivian] Oh, I like your house.

59:47.333 --> 59:48.376
[water bubbling]

59:48.459 --> 59:49.460
[Carmen] Thank you.

59:50.253 --> 59:52.171
[Vivian] All these colors are so cute.

59:52.255 --> 59:54.299
[Carmen] Oh, thank you.

59:54.382 --> 59:56.259
[Vivian] It's such a beautiful home.

59:57.260 --> 59:59.429
[Carmen] You're too kind, Ms…

59:59.512 --> 1:00:02.849

1:00:02.932 --> 1:00:03.933
[bubbling]

1:00:06.811 --> 1:00:09.814
I'm sorry.
I feel so silly just standing out here.

1:00:09.897 --> 1:00:10.773
Can I come in?

1:00:10.857 --> 1:00:13.484
-No!
-Luis Acosta de la Vega!

1:00:13.568 --> 1:00:15.403
[in Spanish] Mom, don't let her in.

1:00:15.486 --> 1:00:17.488
[in Spanish]
She can't attack without an invitation.

1:00:17.572 --> 1:00:20.742
Lil Mayor,
why would I want to attack you?

1:00:20.825 --> 1:00:22.493
Because you're a vampire!

1:00:22.577 --> 1:00:25.038
-Bobby!
-This lady's a vampire, Ms. Martinez.

1:00:25.121 --> 1:00:27.707
That's why she can't enter.
She needs an invitation.

1:00:27.790 --> 1:00:29.626
I need my key back, Miguel.

1:00:30.752 --> 1:00:34.380
Give it to me before I drain you
like I did your late friend, Tony.

1:00:34.964 --> 1:00:36.132
What are you?

1:00:36.215 --> 1:00:38.176
I'm Vivian Tyrell,

1:00:38.259 --> 1:00:40.136
firstborn of the Master Murnau,

1:00:40.219 --> 1:00:42.388
commander in the vampire expedition.

1:00:42.472 --> 1:00:44.557
Expedition? What kind of expedition?

1:00:44.641 --> 1:00:46.643
To find my people a home.

1:00:47.518 --> 1:00:49.312
You see, I'm just like you, Miguel.

1:00:50.104 --> 1:00:52.315
I don't want the Bronx to change.

1:00:52.398 --> 1:00:56.152
[echoing] It's easier to live somewhere
where no one cares when people disappear.

1:00:56.235 --> 1:00:57.153
I'm nothing like you!

1:00:57.236 --> 1:00:58.321
[roars]

1:00:59.364 --> 1:01:01.324
If you give me my key back,

1:01:01.407 --> 1:01:03.493
I promise to make your deaths quick.

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:07.497
Fine.

1:01:10.124 --> 1:01:11.292
I'll give you your key.

[roaring viciously]

1:01:24.764 --> 1:01:27.642
Mommy, don't worry.
We're safe as long as we stay in here.

1:01:28.267 --> 1:01:30.228
[sighs] I'm calling the police.

1:01:30.311 --> 1:01:32.730
You already saw with Frank.
The police are on their side.

1:01:32.814 --> 1:01:34.607
We need to stay in here
until the sun comes up.

1:01:35.191 --> 1:01:37.235
Call your families.
We're staying here tonight.

1:01:37.318 --> 1:01:39.862
In the morning, we're out of the Bronx.

1:01:39.946 --> 1:01:41.114
It's not worth it.

1:01:43.741 --> 1:01:45.118
[police siren blaring]

1:01:49.997 --> 1:01:50.957
Commander.

1:01:59.757 --> 1:02:02.218
-Is it done?
-Yes, commander.

1:02:04.011 --> 1:02:06.431
We had to go above-market,
and it was an all-cash deal,

1:02:07.682 --> 1:02:09.058
but the building is yours.

1:02:10.685 --> 1:02:13.187
No need for an invitation
to the kid's apartment.

1:02:15.356 --> 1:02:16.566
Um…

1:02:16.649 --> 1:02:17.567
Commander…

1:02:18.609 --> 1:02:19.527
I was just…

1:02:20.778 --> 1:02:22.613
I was wondering
when I'd be getting the gift.

1:02:25.533 --> 1:02:28.244
You know, I feel
like I'm… I'm ready for it.

1:02:29.579 --> 1:02:30.455

1:02:35.501 --> 1:02:37.295
[Vivian] Make another mistake,

1:02:38.588 --> 1:02:40.173
you'll never get the gift.

1:02:40.256 --> 1:02:43.009

-You'll never be one of us.

-Yo.

1:03:24.509 --> 1:03:26.093
[whispers] Yo, what are you doing?

1:03:28.888 --> 1:03:30.014
Going to the nest.

1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:33.226
I'm gonna take out
every last one of them.

1:03:34.894 --> 1:03:36.270
We gotta defend ourselves.

1:03:36.771 --> 1:03:40.650
We gotta show them
that Tony and everyone else matters.

1:03:43.402 --> 1:03:45.780
If we do it together,
we might have a chance.

1:03:46.405 --> 1:03:47.240
Bet.

1:03:49.992 --> 1:03:51.077
We're going with you.

1:03:52.620 --> 1:03:54.121
I'm done being scared.

1:04:36.831 --> 1:04:38.666
Hey, come back with that thing, man!

1:04:52.221 --> 1:04:53.055
[Rita] Hey.

1:04:54.056 --> 1:04:55.182
Thanks for the invite.

1:04:55.725 --> 1:04:57.268
-We didn't know that--
-Here.

1:04:57.810 --> 1:04:58.895
Welcome to the crew.

1:04:59.478 --> 1:05:01.814
Thanks. Now, let's go kill some suckheads.

1:05:03.816 --> 1:05:04.901
[squeaking]

1:05:07.820 --> 1:05:08.696
This way.

1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:25.046
-This is the nest.
-Yeah, I know.

1:05:25.630 --> 1:05:29.342
That's her sarcophagus right there.
If we strike her, we weaken the others.

1:05:29.842 --> 1:05:30.676
Uh?

1:05:31.135 --> 1:05:32.553
You guys knew that, right?

1:05:33.804 --> 1:05:34.639
No.

1:05:34.722 --> 1:05:37.016
That's why I told y'all
not to be messing with this stuff.

1:05:41.270 --> 1:05:43.022
All right, three, two…

1:05:46.651 --> 1:05:47.568

1:05:49.111 --> 1:05:52.490
-[Bobby] What the hell?
-They knew we were coming.

1:05:53.074 --> 1:05:54.241
They could be anywhere.

1:06:00.706 --> 1:06:02.249
You gave that to Vivian.

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:05.962
We gotta go back and warn everybody.

1:06:09.006 --> 1:06:10.341
-Bobby!
-[Bobby] The balloons.

1:06:10.424 --> 1:06:11.258
[Miguel] Damn.

1:06:14.470 --> 1:06:16.389
-[Luis] What is it?
-[bubbling]

1:06:16.472 --> 1:06:17.682
[Miguel] It's bubbling.

1:06:26.774 --> 1:06:29.026
-They must be up here.
-[Rita] Miguel, it's too dangerous.

1:06:29.110 --> 1:06:30.069
Don't go up there.

1:06:30.152 --> 1:06:32.947
We have 30 minutes to sundown.
If we can find their hiding place,

1:06:33.030 --> 1:06:34.365
we can get a jump on them.

1:06:35.741 --> 1:06:36.826
Well, we coming too.

1:06:37.910 --> 1:06:39.829
Well, someone has to go warn everyone.

1:06:39.912 --> 1:06:41.789
I'll go, and I'll get Father Jackson.

1:06:41.872 --> 1:06:44.458
Listen, just promise me you
won't go in that room without us, okay?

1:06:46.961 --> 1:06:47.878
Okay.

1:06:48.879 --> 1:06:49.880
Hey!

1:06:52.341 --> 1:06:55.011
Can you tell my mom that I love her…

1:06:56.470 --> 1:06:58.180
and that I'm sorry about, um…

1:06:59.223 --> 1:07:00.725
uh, about my room,

1:07:01.225 --> 1:07:02.184
about lying,

1:07:03.269 --> 1:07:04.645

1:07:04.729 --> 1:07:05.855
[soft music playing]

1:07:05.938 --> 1:07:08.524
Listen, you tell her…

1:07:10.568 --> 1:07:11.444
when you see her.

1:07:19.493 --> 1:07:21.912
Yo, Rita. Like, what about the rest of us?

1:07:21.996 --> 1:07:23.789
We all got messages, you know?

1:07:24.707 --> 1:07:28.044
[smacks lips] I guess you didn't need
to use them VIP passes after all, playa.

1:08:08.959 --> 1:08:10.461
-You ready?
-Yeah.

1:08:11.587 --> 1:08:12.421
Let's go.

1:08:13.506 --> 1:08:14.840

1:08:22.431 --> 1:08:23.641
Where the hell are they?

1:08:28.646 --> 1:08:29.563
Guys.

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:50.376

-Um…

1:09:56.066 --> 1:09:57.902
Open the curtains! Let the daylight in!

What do we have here?

1:10:13.042 --> 1:10:14.376
How thoughtful of you.

1:10:14.460 --> 1:10:18.797
I bought your building
so I could enter and retrieve this key,

1:10:19.673 --> 1:10:21.759
but you just saved me the trouble.

1:10:27.890 --> 1:10:29.266

1:10:33.145 --> 1:10:34.188
What is that?

1:10:34.271 --> 1:10:37.149
This is the remains of the first vampire.

1:10:38.484 --> 1:10:39.652
My maker.

1:10:40.861 --> 1:10:42.446
The maker of all of us.

1:10:43.364 --> 1:10:44.782
His ashes have the power

1:10:44.865 --> 1:10:46.617
to make new vampires.

1:10:46.700 --> 1:10:48.285
One handful of this

1:10:50.579 --> 1:10:52.915
a bite on her neck,

1:10:53.499 --> 1:10:55.459

1:11:39.795 --> 1:11:41.297
but you'll never be one of them.

1:11:42.464 --> 1:11:43.841
I know that for a fact.

1:11:45.634 --> 1:11:47.177
You'll be their kid brother, right?

1:11:48.262 --> 1:11:50.139
That means you gonna be their bitch.

1:11:51.640 --> 1:11:53.559
Like, for all eternity.
