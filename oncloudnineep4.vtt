00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.620
Are you going to sleep?

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.100
Yes.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100
There is something I need to think about.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.640
Can I have a second?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.360
What happened last night?

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.720
Mon...

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.720
Mon...

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.720
Yes?

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.340
Mon...

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.340
Why do you have to call my name out loud? We're so near.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.460
What's going on, Mork?

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.300
Mon, do you like P'Tiew?

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600
Yes, I like him.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.260
We shouldn't do like this.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.260
What?

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.260
Should we stop playing this game?

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.360
Playing with human feelings is not so funny.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.540
Mork, do you like P'Tiew?

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.540
I don't know.

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.620
What I'm feeling right now is...

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.620
I don't want him to be sad.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.040
He's so sincere to us while he doesn't know that we're playing with his feeling.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.500
I feel guilty for him.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.240
If you really like him, just tell him.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.240
How can I do that?

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.240
You like him first, 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.400
and then I met him

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.640
after you told me about him.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.640
You've never been like this.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.060
I think you should tell him.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.020
Let me clear with him by today.

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.060
P'Mek...

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.780
Where is Mork?

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.700
P'Tiew...

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.420
We have to talk.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.600
Let's go for a ride

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.380
around Chiang Mai city.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.680
I'm sorry.

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.280
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you...

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.220
At first, I was so angry.

00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:22.720
But now I understand.

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.060
It's difficult for you to tell me.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:33.180
Because you're afraid that I would be sad.

00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:49.500
Mork...

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.360
I like you.

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:39.820
Human has to learn to be happy and sad until the last breath.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:43.720
But luckily, in this universe...

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:52.960
the spirit will have a chance to feel the last happiness within 99 days after the last breath.

00:09:55.740 --> 00:10:02.740
The last happiness is controlled by a white-blood man.

00:10:02.899 --> 00:10:08.670
He is not an Angel or Seraph but he is beyond the time.

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:16.959
He is not only trusting, but also wondering, monitoring, and controlling.

00:10:16.959 --> 00:10:25.841
His name is...

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:26.975
Wise

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:32.580
I made this key from your last memory.

00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:43.920
You've used this key for your last happiness for almost 99 days.

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160
Hey!

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.040
Aren't you shocked?

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.040
I'm not!

00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:14.980
From your smile, you're thinking of me, aren't you?

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:20.980
You didn't answer my question.

00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:24.980
I assume that you accept that you're thinking of me.

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.060
Aren't you homesick?

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.000
Homesick?

00:12:41.940 --> 00:12:45.480
Homesick? I may be homesick.

00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:53.020
You may take annual leave for so long.

00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.020
Don't you have jobs?

00:12:57.020 --> 00:12:59.020
Or did you lose your jobs?

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:02.820
Whatever!

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.820
How many days have you been back in Chiang Mai?

00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:09.320
3 days...

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.780
So tomorrow is your fourth day.

00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:17.780
Why tomorrow?

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:24.700
Tomorrow? Tomorrow is yet to come. Don't you know?

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:42.380
I'm feeling blurry and dizzy lately.

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:52.480
Don't worry. I used to have this feeling. It takes some time to remember.

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.480
Remember?

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.160
I mean tomorrow you'll get better.

00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:03.300
Let's go...

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:04.520
Where?

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:06.520
Somewhere you used to go... Hurry up!

00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.320
Won't you go back home?

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.320
Not now...

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.980
I think I'll wait until 99 days before going back home.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.600
Why? You quarreled with people at home?

00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.340
Nope!

00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:49.300
Don't be shy. I often quarreled with people at home.

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.560
I see, good boy!

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:46.840
Are you in relationship?

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.200
I don't know.

00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.580
Maybe yes

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.480
Maybe no.

00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:04.480
Yes or No?

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:09.420
Hmm... I don't know what to say...

00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:14.860
I used to be in relationship or not?

00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.860
I'm in relationship or not?

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:31.960
I think I used to see someone like you...

00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.420
I think I made up my own mind.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.160
Why don't you change your clothes?

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.160
You always wear white clothes.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:12.200
I think these clothes...

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.200
are the best for my style.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:23.060
I think this color suits yours.

00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.060
Why?

00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:27.060
Your clothes look clean.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.120
My clothes are dark in color...

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.120
and dark handsome.

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.440
Can you smell me that much?

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:07.440
You're so strange!

00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:14.800
I think...

00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.800
clean color suits you.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:15.440
Wake up!

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:31.540
Are you in relationship?

00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.540
Hmm, I'm not sure...

00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:38.620
If I may say that I have someone special, I don't think so.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
It's called one sided love...

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.340
Do you think when will we love someone the most?

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:57.100
Before you've changed.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.100
How about you?

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.100
When?

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.220
I think when we know that we'll be apart.

00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:32.120
What is it?

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.140
It's the first dew of winter.

00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.260
Please drink.

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.640
You'll feel better.

00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.800
Do you feel better?

00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:28.260
Hmm...

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.140
Do you feel better?

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.500
Mork...

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.900
Who?

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.920
