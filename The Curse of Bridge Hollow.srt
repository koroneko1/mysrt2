Come on! Sing with us.

8
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:33,250
Sorry, Dad, but a family sing-along

9
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,958
isn't gonna make me
feel better about moving.

10
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:39,333
Look, Syd.

11
00:00:39,416 --> 00:00:41,666
I know you're gonna miss Brooklyn. Okay?

12
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,083
But you won't miss the smell
of hydrogen sulfide every morning.

13
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,166
Because Bridge Hollow
smells like... apples

14
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:52,291
and a hint of white privilege.

15
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:57,708
And it was named "safest small town
in the US" last ten years running. So...

16
00:00:57,791 --> 00:01:01,500
Give Bridge Hollow a chance.
Small towns can be full of surprises.

17
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:03,208
And speaking of surprises...

00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:31,333
Whoa!

26
00:01:34,958 --> 00:01:35,791
What?

27
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,708
<i>Ahoy there, matey!</i>

28
00:01:43,041 --> 00:01:45,625
Is it me,
or did we just drive in to a Party City?

29
00:01:53,416 --> 00:01:55,333
Look! There it is.

30
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:56,541
Home sweet home.

31
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,833
Hey, Syd! Pop quiz.

32
00:01:59,416 --> 00:02:02,875
If we left Brooklyn
20 minutes after the movers,

33
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:07,291
and they show up in the next two,
how much faster did we...

34
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:10,291
Whoa! Check out those zombies!

35
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:12,083
Oh yeah. Okay.

36
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,000
That's not disturbing at all.

37
00:02:15,291 --> 00:02:18,250
Hey, babe, let's not invite
those neighbors over for dinner.

38
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:22,500
Dad, since we're not living
in an apartment anymore,

39
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,500
maybe we can finally decorate
our house for Halloween!

40
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,208
Uh...

41
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,375
- You didn't answer my question.
- Mom, can we get a ruling?

42
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:33,476
- Yes, I mean...
- You gonna take me to Family Court?

43
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,420
It would be nice to fit in
with the neighborhood.

44
00:02:35,458 --> 00:02:39,000
But, you know, we're gonna be so busy
moving in and getting ready for school.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,791
- The court rules in favor of Dad.
- Mmm.

46
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:42,875
I'm sorry, baby.

47
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:44,375
Maybe next year?

48
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,875
The system's rigged.

49
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,166
Okay. Let's go.

50
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:50,041
It's the movers!

51
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:42,833
Careful. Fragile package.

52
00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,125
Ha, ha, ha. Thank you.

53
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,625
- Kid's room. Upstairs.
- Okay.

54
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,875
Hey, neighbor! What's shakin'?

55
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:53,250
John Sullivan.
But everyone around here calls me Sully.

56
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,000
Except for my ex-wife.
I don't wanna tell you what she calls me.

57
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:59,416
Howard Gordon. My wife calls me "honey."

58
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,916
- That's... That's tough.
- Yeah.

59
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,916
Well, hey, listen,
you picked a hell of a time to move in.

60
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,291
As you can see, everybody around here
kind of goes crazy around Halloween, huh?

61
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:11,000
Yeah. It's a little ridiculous, right?

62
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,083
Huh?

63
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:16,208
No, I meant, uh, "crazy" as in "good."

64
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,208
- Oh yeah. I...
- Yeah.

65
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,541
- Really? Yeah.
- Yeah! Yeah.

66
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,500
See, the way it works here
is everybody kind of picks a theme,

67
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:30,291
and then you go big-time on that theme.
Really lean into it.

68
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:31,458
You gotta commit.

69
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,958
This year, I pulled out all the stops.

70
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:37,916
<i>The Walking Dead.</i>

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,500
- Booyah!
<i>- </i>Yeah...

72
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,333
Not a fan. They jumped the shark
when they killed Glenn.

73
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,250
Yeah, that was a loss for everybody.

74
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,500
- So you got a theme?
- No.

75
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,101
- You like werewolves?
- Not particularly.

76
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,541
'Cause I got
a whole shed full of werewolves.

77
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,250
That's real wolf fur.
I don't even know if it's legal.

78
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,166
And I don't care. 'Cause it's Halloween.

79
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:00,291
Uh, no, thanks. We're good.

80
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,666
- Really?
- We don't decorate.

81
00:05:02,541 --> 00:05:03,458
Jehovah's Witness.

82
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,916
No, I... just... think it's...
kind of silly.

83
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,291
- What?
- Do you still believe in Santa Claus?

84
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,041
Why? What have you heard? Is he okay?

85
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,708
Nice meeting you.

86
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:21,541
Great meeting you too, Howard.
Hey, you want that werewolf?

87
00:05:21,625 --> 00:05:24,666
I can get that werewolf into your yard
in five minutes. It's not a problem.

88
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,583
- No, I'm... We're good.
- Wife got you on a short...

89
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,958
- Yeah, I get it.
- Go. Turn around. Keep going.

90
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,333
So, how unhappy
do you think Syd is about the move?

91
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:42,416
One to ten?

92
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,375
They haven't invented
a scale big enough to measure this one.

93
00:05:47,166 --> 00:05:48,166
I don't know.

94
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:52,416
I feel like she's turning into somebody
I don't even recognize anymore.

95
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,500
Well, that's what teenagers do, baby.

96
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,750
They... they grow up.
They become their own person.

97
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:02,375
And you have to let her.

98
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,708
And what's that supposed to mean?

99
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,833
You pushed her to be on the science team.

100
00:06:07,916 --> 00:06:09,833
Yeah, because she loves science.

101
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:11,583
And science...

102
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,291
is awesome.

103
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,916
She wanted to take ballet.

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Right.

105
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:21,500
But now, our baby girl can defend herself.

106
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,541
You can't fight off a mugger
doing a pirouette.

107
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:27,333
Howard, this isn't Brooklyn.

108
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:31,666
The scariest things around here
are the decorations on people's lawns.

109
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,000
Just...

110
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,833
give her some space.

111
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,750
Okay.

112
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,583
I'm putting it up.

113
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,041
Look, Howard! Don't you think
that would be perfect for my bake shop?

114
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,625
Are you sure about this?

115
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,958
Running a bakery
is a lot different than being a lawyer.

116
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:27,250
I'm sure. I even decided on a name.

117
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,333
The Bridge Hollow Bakery.

118
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,158
Might wanna workshop that one.

119
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,291
- Hey, Mom.
- Huh.

120
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,250
Are you gonna sell
things you normally make

121
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,541
or things that taste good?

122
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:39,291
Ha ha. I know you guys usually hate
on anything without gluten or butter,

123
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,458
but the PTA moms in Brooklyn
love my sugar-free pumpkin pie

124
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:43,708
with almond-powder crust.

125
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:46,552
- And this town is gonna love them too.
- I'm sure they will.

126
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:50,166
Hey, there they are! The Gordons!

127
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,833
Baby?

128
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,458
Why does the crazy white lady
in the pumpkin car know who we are?

129
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:56,916
You're probably wondering,

130
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,392
"How does this crazy white lady
in a pumpkin car know who we are?"

131
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,541
- No... Yeah.
- Tammy Rice. The mayor around here.

132
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:05,208
Don't be too impressed.
It's a volunteer position.

133
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,166
I also teach piano and drive an Uber.

134
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:09,642
You'd be surprised how many people
wanna ride in this pumpkin.

135
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,750
Hey, Howard, your first ride's on me, huh?

136
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:14,958
Big science teacher from the big city!

137
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,166
Ah, no, thank you.

138
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,458
And what is all the signs up
for Stingy Jack?

139
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:19,833
Who is he? The town founder?

140
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,583
Wait, you've never heard of Stingy Jack?

141
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:24,833
Okay. Well,
I turned his story into a sweater.

142
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:25,958
So...

143
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,333
According to an old Irish legend,

144
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:31,458
there once lived
a wicked man named Stingy Jack.

145
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,166
And he was such a jerk

146
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:36,333
that the villagers finally had enough,
and...

147
00:08:37,708 --> 00:08:40,916
But the devil felt sorry for Jack,
so he made him a lantern.

148
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:44,666
A pumpkin carved out with a flame
from the fires of hell.

149
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,750
Hmm?

150
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:51,333
Every Halloween, Jack would return
to our town, Bridge Hollow,

151
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:55,166
to seek his revenge on the descendants
of the villagers who did him in.

152
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:58,684
Well, that's what we tell the tourists.
Am I right?

153
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:03,208
Wait, so that's why
they call them jack-o'- lanterns!

154
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,458
Hey, Syd, what do you say
we go hit up the local museum

155
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:08,708
where we can learn some actual facts.

156
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,958
Uh, no. I'm gonna explore this town

157
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:13,416
and find something
that's actually fun to do.

158
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,708
She'll be fine.
Safest small town in the US, remember?

159
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:20,916
That's right, but don't let
any of those sore losers in Oaktown

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
hear you say that.

161
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,958
They didn't even make the top ten.

162
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,625
Uh, so, is there gonna be
any food at this festival?

163
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:29,916
Of course! Yeah, a lot
of the local stores are setting up booths.

164
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,916
We got hot dogs, funnel cakes,
chowder, everything.

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,500
Uh, is there gonna be
any artisanal vegan baked goods?

166
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:39,083
Hmm. I don't know what that means.
But sure, why not?

167
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:25,208
Whoa!

168
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:28,541
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.

169
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:30,208
What were you guys doing in there?

170
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,291
Grave-digging.

171
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:35,666
You can get really good money
on the dark web for a fully intact corpse.

172
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,000
I'm kidding.

173
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,500
Show her, Mario.

174
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:42,958
Um, testing out
this new spectral EM four detection app.

175
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:44,881
It measures
electromagnetic field fluctuations.

176
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:45,958
Which is what happens

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,958
whenever the electrical charges in the air
are disturbed by a...

178
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,458
Ghost or other paranormal phenomena.

179
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:54,875
So, what are you guys?

180
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:58,333
Like, the Bridge Hollow High
Paranormal Society or something?

181
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:04,458
See? I told you the shirts were lame.

182
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:05,958
No, I like them.

183
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:06,958
Who is this girl?

184
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,583
Guys, don't be weird.

185
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,416
I'm Jamie. That's Ramona. This is Mario.

186
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,708
Sydney.

187
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,041
Wait. Sydney Gordon?

188
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,767
You and your folks just moved
to the old Hawthorne house.

189
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,250
The what house?

190
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,291
Come on.
There's something you need to see.

191
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:30,166
Madam Hawthorne. One of the preeminent
spiritualist mediums of the 20th century.

192
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,583
She lived and died in your house.

193
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,666
Rumor has it she might still be there.

194
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,416
Wait, so I might live in a haunted house?

195
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,416
This place just got a lot cooler.

196
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,625
So, you're, like, into this kind of stuff.

197
00:11:42,708 --> 00:11:46,583
Yeah. Kinda. I was gonna start
a Paranormal Club at my school, but...

198
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,750
You didn't wanna be a social leper.

199
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,416
No. My dad wanted me
to join the science team instead.

200
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:55,916
Wow, he... sounds so... awesome.

201
00:11:57,375 --> 00:12:01,583
So, have you experienced anything strange
in your house since you moved in?

202
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,166
- Cold drafts?
- Power fluctuations?

203
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,041
Voices from beyond the grave?

204
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,666
Well, I did hear
this weird noise the other night,

205
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:10,375
and it was
definitely not the house settling.

206
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:17,458
Well, in that case,
we have some homework for you.

207
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:32,208
Okay, not exactly sure
how this works,

208
00:12:33,125 --> 00:12:34,375
but here goes nothing.

209
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,416
Madam Hawthorne.

210
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:40,875
Can you hear me?

211
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:49,666
H...

212
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,458
E...

213
00:12:53,291 --> 00:12:54,500
R...

214
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:57,375
Here?

215
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,833
You're here?

216
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:04,583
Hello?

217
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,500
"SJ 1927."

218
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,041
Ah!

219
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,708
Mmm.

220
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:48,208
So you guys
are not gonna believe this,

221
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:49,958
but this house is totally haunted.

222
00:15:51,333 --> 00:15:52,166
What?

223
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,770
No! For real!

224
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:55,958
By an old Gypsy woman named Hawthorne.

225
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,208
She used to live here in this house.

226
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,666
And for some reason,
she gave me her pumpkin, but...

227
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,958
Oh, I get it. And that's why
we should move back to Brooklyn.

228
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:07,708
I'm not making this up.
Haven't you heard all the freaky noises?

229
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:11,125
It's an old house, sweetie.
Old houses are like old people.

230
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,958
- They make freaky noises.
- Yeah, and they're drafty.

231
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,833
It's the wood. It expands. It contracts.

232
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,541
It's not ghosts. It's science.

233
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,750
Let me tell you what happened.
I was using the Ouija board app...

234
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,791
Oh, come on. A Ouija board is nonsense,

235
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,416
and an app is even worse.

236
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:28,416
What's the ghost supposed to do?
Get a Wi-Fi password?

237
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,791
Ow!

238
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,541
I don't know why I even bothered.
I should have known.

239
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:33,625
Known what?

240
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,833
That you would make fun of me
for believing in things like this.

241
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,416
Just like you always do.

242
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,750
I... I do not. Do I... do I make fun...

243
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,500
You just did.

244
00:16:43,583 --> 00:16:46,333
Well, it's not what I meant.

245
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:49,166
I just want you to start
looking at the world scientifically.

246
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:52,375
Then you'll realize
that all these crazy things

247
00:16:52,458 --> 00:16:54,666
have a much more realistic explanation.

248
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,958
So you weren't making fun of me.
You just think I'm stupid. Okay.

249
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,416
Wait. I... I didn't say you were stupid!

250
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,208
Just ignorant.

251
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,250
I'm about to smack you.

252
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:20,125
Oh! There he is! In the flesh.
The man, the myth, the legend.

253
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:22,500
Principal Pretty-Boy Floyd.

254
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,208
Good to see you again, buddy.

255
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,476
Thanks for the help getting us settled.
I appreciate it.

256
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,041
Oh, no, Howard.
Thank you for stepping in midsemester.

257
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,958
You really saved my behind.

258
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:32,750
Boy, when Mr. Viveros won the lottery

259
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,250
and took off
to Key West with his mistress,

260
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,833
it really put us in a pickle.

261
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,208
- Yeah...
- Oh...

262
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,666
- You don't play the lottery, do you?
- No.

263
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,250
Okay.

264
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,208
- And the marriage?
- Solid.

265
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,958
- Really?
- Jay-Z/Beyoncé.

266
00:17:47,541 --> 00:17:49,500
- I'll show you the classroom.
- All right.

267
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,375
Well, here it is.

268
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,208
Check it out.

269
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:58,083
Wow! We didn't have all this in Brooklyn.

270
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,583
- Yeah.
- This is great.

271
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,125
Brand-new microscopes.

272
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:04,041
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Bunsen burner at every station.

273
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,750
- These are yours now.
- Thank you.

274
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,458
- We got a brand-new sterilizer here.
- Nice.

275
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:11,291
- Chemical cabinet, fully stocked.
- Okay.

276
00:18:15,041 --> 00:18:17,000
Whoa!

277
00:18:17,583 --> 00:18:18,625
Ah, look at this!

278
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,583
The kids on the science team
rigged this one up for you.

279
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,041
- You like it?
- No, no, no.

280
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:26,208
They call him Albert Spine-stein.

281
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,666
Get... Ooh.

282
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,666
Get... Get him off.

283
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:30,625
That's funny.

284
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,958
Did we get you?

285
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:34,500
Yeah, you got me.

286
00:18:34,583 --> 00:18:37,125
Yeah, Howard.

287
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,416
Come on in, kids.

288
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,875
This is, uh, Mr. Gordon,
your new science teacher.

289
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:42,798
He'll be with you
for the rest of the semester.

290
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:44,000
<i>♪ Bring out the freaks ♪</i>

291
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:46,833
<i>♪ It's gonna be a helluva night... ♪</i>

292
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,666
I have never been so scared.
When I opened the trunk,

293
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,625
I thought it was gonna be,
like, this severed head inside.

294
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,833
Turned out it was
just some broke-ass pumpkin.

295
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,625
Oh, that reminds me. I...

296
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,208
I don't know
what you got planned for tonight,

297
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,333
but we'll be back up at the school,

298
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:06,000
working the...
the "Halls of Horror."

299
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,708
You should come. It's... sick.

300
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,541
We go every year.
So it's obviously super cool.

301
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,541
Okay. It's a little cheesy.

302
00:19:13,625 --> 00:19:17,041
But everyone wears a costume,
and it's fun to check them all out.

303
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,958
Yeah, sounds really cool, guys,
but I don't really have a costume.

304
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,958
My family doesn't really do Halloween.

305
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,875
What does that even mean?

306
00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:32,791
It's my dad's thing to hate on Halloween.
He says he thinks it's stupid.

307
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:35,291
This guy just doesn't get it.

308
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,750
But I honestly think,
for some dumb reason,

309
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,458
it actually freaks him out.

310
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,958
No pressure, but you know where to find us
if you change your mind.

311
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,083
- Okay.
- Bye.

312
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,833
Hmm. Screw it.

313
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:14,333

Trick or treat!

328
00:20:47,166 --> 00:20:48,250
Oh!

329
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:49,375
Oh!

330
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:53,125
Kid, never ever jump
out the bushes on a Black man.

331
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:55,708
Leave candy on your porch next time.
It's Halloween.

332
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:59,166
Boy, you better get
your little behind off my... property.

333
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:07,875
Aw, come on, Sully.

334
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,208
A rubber bat.

335
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,125
Trick or treat!

336
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,291
Sydney!

337
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:48,916
Hi, Dad.

338
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,875
Okay.

339
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,166
Okay. I see what you're doing.

340
00:21:56,250 --> 00:21:57,250
What am I doing?

341
00:21:57,333 --> 00:22:00,583
If I had to guess,
I'd say trying to annoy me.

342
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:04,708
No, I'm trying to have fun.
Annoying you is just the bonus.

343
00:22:04,791 --> 00:22:09,500
Look, I'm sorry if you thought
I was making fun of you.

344
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:10,750
And for moving me here.

345
00:22:10,833 --> 00:22:14,000
- I did that for our family.
- And for treating me like a child.

346
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,791
You are a child.

347
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:20,125
Do you want to know something, Dad?
I'm done being treated like a baby.

348
00:22:20,208 --> 00:22:22,625
I'm 14. I can make my own decisions,

349
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,625
starting with what holidays
I choose to celebrate.

350
00:22:25,708 --> 00:22:29,333
Oh, and you know that science team
you love so much?

351
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:31,500
Yeah, well, I hate it, and I quit.

352
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:35,875
Yeah?

353
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,291
Well, how about this?

354
00:22:38,041 --> 00:22:39,208
You're grounded.

355
00:22:40,041 --> 00:22:41,291
What? Why?

356
00:22:41,875 --> 00:22:44,458
Because I'm your father, and I said so.

357
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:45,583
Now go to your room.

358
00:22:45,666 --> 00:22:46,666
Hmm?

359
00:22:55,625 --> 00:22:58,666
You heard me. I said, go to your roo...

360
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,750
Cute. Little trick candle?

361
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:08,375
Little magnesium on the wick?

362
00:23:08,458 --> 00:23:11,041
I got something for you. Hmm?
How about that? Hmm?

363
00:23:15,875 --> 00:23:17,541
What about that?

364
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:19,875
Okay.

365
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:23,375
How do you like those apples?

366
00:23:24,916 --> 00:23:27,916
You and your little tricks.
Thinking you all grown.

367
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,625
Dad, it was still lit!

368
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:33,833
Relax. Saliva neutralized... What the...

369
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:47,625
Oh shit!

370
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:48,958
Hey, watch your mouth!

371
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:51,333
Ah, shit! Shit!

372
00:23:54,041 --> 00:23:55,041
Ah!

373
00:23:59,166 --> 00:24:00,250
Oh!

374
00:24:06,625 --> 00:24:08,250
Come here! Come.

375
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,583
I can't believe
you brought a bat into our home!

376
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:14,041
Dad! Do you really think
I went into some cave,

377
00:24:14,125 --> 00:24:16,000
found a live bat, and brought it home?

378
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,791
Not all bats live in caves.

379
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:20,916
Actually, some species,
they live under bridges or in trees.

380
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,375
You know, it's funny,
the western red bat...

381
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:25,208
Dad, the bat isn't real!

382
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:26,666
Whoa!

383
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,666
It sure looked real to me!

384
00:24:42,666 --> 00:24:44,208
Where is it?

385
00:24:44,291 --> 00:24:45,375
I don't know.

386
00:24:47,708 --> 00:24:49,250
Dad!

387
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,125
Look how much candy I got.

388
00:25:14,375 --> 00:25:16,166
If you're trying to annoy me,

389
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:17,250
it worked.

390
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:18,916
Oh, it worked.

391
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:44,916
Uh, Dad, I think
something really weird is going on.

392
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:58,250
- And I'm gonna find out what it is.
- Oh, no, you're not.

393
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,083
You're grounded, remember?

394
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,041
Wait, who... who are you calling?

395
00:26:04,583 --> 00:26:08,333
You can call God for all I care, so...
I said what I said.

396
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:11,916
- Hey, Syd, what's up?
- Mom, there's some spooky sh...

397
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,000
"stuff" happening tonight.
I know it sounds weird,

398
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,375
<i>but the Halloween decorations
are coming to life.</i>

399
00:26:18,458 --> 00:26:21,500
I want to find out what's going on,
but Dad won't let me.

400
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:22,583
Gimme the phone.

401
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:28,041
- Emily, listen, your daughter is trippin'.
<i>- No. Think about your daughter.</i>

402
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:31,125
She wanted to stay in Brooklyn.
And you said no.

403
00:26:31,208 --> 00:26:34,208
- I know, but you...
- She wanted to decorate the house.

404
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:35,291
And you said no.

405
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:37,625
<i>She wanted to take ballet.</i>

406
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,875
- Baby, you said no.
- But... but that's for her safety.

407
00:26:40,958 --> 00:26:44,916
We are not saying no to this.
It's Halloween. Let her have some fun.

408
00:26:45,666 --> 00:26:46,791
<i>Put me on speaker.</i>

409
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,250
<i>The court rules in favor...</i>

410
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,000
<i>of Sydney.</i>

411
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,583
- Yes!
<i>- </i>Damn.

412
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,666
The system works.

413
00:26:58,750 --> 00:26:59,750
Okay.

414
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,458
You can go, but I'm going with you.

415
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
- What?
- Look.

416
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:07,833
Halloween brings out all the crazies,
even in a safe town like this.

417
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:12,083
No. Mm-mm. Tomorrow, you get space.
Tonight, you get me.

418
00:27:12,166 --> 00:27:13,000
<i>Court agrees!</i>

419
00:27:13,083 --> 00:27:14,375
Yeah!

420
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:15,625
<i>Have fun, you guys.</i>

421
00:27:15,708 --> 00:27:18,666
Come by the Stingy Jack Festival.
I have treats waiting.

422
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:25,166
<i>Brains...</i>

423
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:28,500
Don't worry, kids.
These, uh, zombies won't bite.

424
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,708
Or will they?

425
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:36,291
I'm just busting your beans.
Get in there. Get the good stuff.

426
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,625
Booyah!

427
00:27:41,708 --> 00:27:43,583
That worked too good. That was too good.

428
00:27:43,666 --> 00:27:45,833
You should've seen your faces.
You look ridiculous.

429
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:47,875
You got nailed. You got smoked.

430
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:51,666
I'm just kidding. You guys recovered.
That was a good recovery. I like that.

431
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,125
Come on, grab some stuff here.

432
00:27:53,958 --> 00:27:56,458
There you go. That's for you.
Little something for you.

433
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:58,083
A couple for you. There you go.

434
00:27:58,166 --> 00:27:59,166
Enjoy it.

435
00:28:00,583 --> 00:28:01,666
You're welcome.

436
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:05,000
Be careful out there. A lot of freaks.

437
00:28:09,583 --> 00:28:12,291
Back to bed, Mrs. Sullivan.

438
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:17,083
Eh.

439
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:18,583
Come on.

440
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:26,708
What the...

441
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:28,833
Where'd you come from?

442
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,083
Hey, get out of here. Beat it. Will ya?

443
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:35,708
Feisty little one, huh?

444
00:28:39,416 --> 00:28:41,125
Didn't see that coming,
did you?

445
00:28:41,833 --> 00:28:43,666
All right, let's go. Get out of here.

446
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,083
See, Dad? I told you.

447
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:59,958
The bat's eyes were glowing red,
just like this pumpkin.

448
00:29:00,041 --> 00:29:02,083
Just like the witches
from across the street.

449
00:29:03,125 --> 00:29:04,125
Right.

450
00:29:04,458 --> 00:29:06,458
Witches coming to life.

451
00:29:08,708 --> 00:29:10,500
Okay. So what's your plan?

452
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,000
Drive around town, looking for
Halloween decorations with red eyes?

453
00:29:14,083 --> 00:29:16,625
Someone has to do something,
and it might as well be...

454
00:29:20,083 --> 00:29:22,041
Wait, Syd. Where are you going?

455
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,458
Get off me!

456
00:29:36,125 --> 00:29:38,416
Brains...

457
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,875
Brains...

458
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,416
What the...

459
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,250
- Brains...
- Whoa!

460
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:48,208
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

461
00:29:48,291 --> 00:29:50,250
Oh, come on now. Oh, here we go.

462
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:55,125
Now those are
some impressive animatronics.

463
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:59,125
Way more impressive
than a... stupid werewolf in the shed.

464
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,958
Eat lead, bastard!

465
00:30:01,875 --> 00:30:03,458
Oh yeah.

466
00:30:04,291 --> 00:30:06,500
Oh! That worked. Okay.

467
00:30:06,583 --> 00:30:07,708
Come on. Well...

468
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:09,541
Oh no!

469
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:16,333
Brains...

470
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:19,291
Now, that's a bit much.

471
00:30:19,375 --> 00:30:21,166
Dad, we have to do something.

472
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,166
It... Relax, Syd. Okay?

473
00:30:23,250 --> 00:30:26,041
He's just putting on a show
for the trick-or-treaters.

474
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,916
Although, that is disturbingly realistic.

475
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,666
- I'll do it myself.
- Wait. Syd, wait.

476
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,750
What? Hey, what are you gonna do?

477
00:30:39,916 --> 00:30:42,036
- That... that's not nice, Sydney.
- Oh, yeah!

478
00:30:42,083 --> 00:30:44,791
That was awesome! Oh! Good job.

479
00:30:49,958 --> 00:30:50,958
Brains...

480
00:30:54,291 --> 00:30:56,541
Okay, that...
All right. That's enough play, guys.

481
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,916
Brains...

482
00:31:10,625 --> 00:31:12,666
- Booyah!
- Holy cow!

483
00:31:13,666 --> 00:31:15,041
Syd, are you okay?

484
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:18,083
What happened here?
Did all these things short-circuit?

485
00:31:18,166 --> 00:31:22,208
I'll tell you what happened here.
One of these zombies just bit me! Huh?

486
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:25,875
Oh God. Does that mean
I'm gonna turn into one of them?

487
00:31:25,958 --> 00:31:27,291
Is that how this works?

488
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:30,375
You can't let me turn.
You gotta shoot me. Blow my head off, man.

489
00:31:30,458 --> 00:31:32,500
What? No, I'm not gonna shoot you!

490
00:31:32,583 --> 00:31:36,166
- I don't wanna turn into a zombie!
- You're not gonna turn into a zombie!

491
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:39,375
Zombies are fictional creations. Okay?

492
00:31:39,458 --> 00:31:41,958
Dead bodies don't have
functioning nervous systems,

493
00:31:42,041 --> 00:31:44,291
which means they can't move.

494
00:31:44,375 --> 00:31:45,500
Basic biology.

495
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,208
I didn't understand
a single word you just said.

496
00:31:48,291 --> 00:31:50,541
Maybe I should handcuff myself
to the porch just in case.

497
00:31:50,625 --> 00:31:53,166
Or you can get a tetanus shot.

498
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:55,791
Yeah. Good call, Bill Nye the Science Guy.

499
00:31:55,875 --> 00:31:57,833
Burn.

500
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,500
You smoked.

501
00:32:00,583 --> 00:32:04,166
Dad, the zombies' eyes were glowing red

502
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,291
just like the bat
and like the flame in Hawthorne's pumpkin.

503
00:32:07,375 --> 00:32:10,083
This all has something to do with her.
I know it does.

504
00:32:10,166 --> 00:32:12,708
I'm gonna try to contact her.

505
00:32:12,791 --> 00:32:15,958
Oh, come on, not the Ouija board app.
Give me a break.

506
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:18,541
Maybe there's another option
we can explore.

507
00:32:18,625 --> 00:32:20,666
Okay. What do you suggest? I'm all ears.

508
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,750
How do you propose
we talk to Hawthorne? She's dead.

509
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:24,958
No, she's not.

510
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
No.

511
00:32:27,583 --> 00:32:30,458
You're talking about old Madam Hawthorne?

512
00:32:30,541 --> 00:32:31,791
Yeah. Oh yeah.

513
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:34,333
She's as dead as one
of these brain-eating bastards.

514
00:32:34,416 --> 00:32:37,166
But her granddaughter Victoria...

515
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,166
...she's still sucking air.

516
00:32:43,541 --> 00:32:44,541
No...

517
00:32:56,708 --> 00:32:59,291
Even the retirement home is decorated?

518
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:03,208
Who wants to trick-or-treat here?

519
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:06,583
Stay alert. An attack could come
from anywhere at any time.

520
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:11,916
Yeah. We're in real danger here.

521
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,000
<i>♪ He's a vampire... ♪</i>

522
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,625
A bumpkin?

523
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:20,125
No. A pumpkin. With a "P."

524
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:23,500
It belonged to your grandmother,
Josephine Hawthorne.

525
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:27,125
That wasn't no pumpkin. It was a turnip.

526
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,208
No, actually,
I'm pretty sure it was a pumpkin.

527
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:34,958
I know a soddin' turnip
when I see one, Chachi.

528
00:33:35,041 --> 00:33:36,583
- Chachi?
- Miss Hawthorne.

529
00:33:36,666 --> 00:33:38,666
Can you tell us about the turnip?

530
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:44,541
Ah... It... It was a long time ago.

531
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,625
I got this, Syd.

532
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:52,583
Look.

533
00:33:54,208 --> 00:33:58,208
I don't wanna be here
any longer than I have to be, so...

534
00:34:02,625 --> 00:34:03,625
Oh!

535
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,083
Take it easy.

536
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:08,000
You can have this
after you tell my daughter

537
00:34:08,083 --> 00:34:09,750
everything she wants to know.

538
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:10,958
Okay?

539
00:34:11,875 --> 00:34:14,750
How y'all doing?
You need any juice?

540
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:18,166
It was a dark and stormy night.

541
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:19,458
Of course it was.

542
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,958
- Why is it never humid and sunny...
- Oh my God...

543
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:24,916
Okay, go.

544
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,583
Mystics from all over the world

545
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:31,083
showed up to our house
at the behest of my Grandma Jo.

546
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:33,500
Madam Hawthorne.

547
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,625
Hurry, we don't have much time.

548
00:34:36,333 --> 00:34:38,041
It's almost midnight.

549
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,875
<i>Their plan
was to use her grimoire,</i>

550
00:34:46,958 --> 00:34:49,458
<i>a book of ancient spells.</i>

551
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:52,666
All right. Let's get to bewitching.

552
00:34:56,708 --> 00:35:01,083
<i>They held a séance
to conjure the spirit himself</i>

553
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:05,916
<i>and finally put an end
to the curse of Stingy Jack.</i>

554
00:35:06,583 --> 00:35:10,166
Wait. Stingy Jack. He's real?

555
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:13,083
He's real, all right.

556
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:17,333
I seen him with my own two eyes.

557
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,458
With those two eyes?

558
00:35:20,541 --> 00:35:23,041
- Stop.
- Okay, I'm sorry. Continue.

559
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:28,250
<i>That old lantern
was a gift from the devil himself.</i>

560
00:35:29,708 --> 00:35:34,791
<i>'Twas what allowed Jack to move
between this world and the spirit world</i>

561
00:35:34,875 --> 00:35:36,916
so that every Halloween,

562
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,708
he could torment
the folks of Bridge Hollow.

563
00:35:40,791 --> 00:35:43,916
But the deal was he could only stay here

564
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,291
from sundown till midnight.

565
00:35:46,375 --> 00:35:48,875
Midnight, Eastern Standard Time?

566
00:35:48,958 --> 00:35:50,500
- Dad.
- What?

567
00:35:51,291 --> 00:35:54,958
But Jack wasn't satisfied
with just one night a year.

568
00:35:55,041 --> 00:35:58,166
He wanted every night to be Halloween.

569
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,166
Turns out there was a loophole.

570
00:36:04,250 --> 00:36:07,500
Jack could stay in our world forever,

571
00:36:07,583 --> 00:36:09,708
free to spread his mayhem

572
00:36:09,791 --> 00:36:11,958
if, at the stroke of midnight,

573
00:36:12,041 --> 00:36:16,291
he found another soul
to take his place in the ever after.

574
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:29,000
<i>But on Halloween night, 1927,</i>

575
00:36:29,083 --> 00:36:33,791
<i>my Grandma Jo put an end
to the old bastard's plan.</i>

576
00:36:41,791 --> 00:36:45,666
Using magic
to trap the ghost of Stingy Jack

577
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:48,875
inside his own lantern.

578
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,958
So long, Jack.

579
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:08,958
As long as that old lantern remains unlit,

580
00:37:09,041 --> 00:37:12,250
you kids got
nothing at all to worry about.

581
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:15,750
Ew!

582
00:37:17,458 --> 00:37:20,458
What if we kind of sort of relit it?

583
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,500
Oh, then you're screwed.

584
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,250
- Hey, Tammy, how are you?
- Not great.

585
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,013
Been getting lots of reports
of decorations

586
00:37:27,041 --> 00:37:28,625
going missing from people's lawns.

587
00:37:29,125 --> 00:37:31,125
Those Oaktown hoodlums
sure love pulling pranks.

588
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,041
- So, what do we have here?
- Oh, well, help yourself.

589
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:38,375
Everything you see here
is gluten-free, soy-free, and vegan.

590
00:37:38,458 --> 00:37:41,708
Oh. Just what people want on Halloween.
Healthy snacks.

591
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:43,458
Here. Try this.

592
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,375
It is a red velvet muffin

593
00:37:45,458 --> 00:37:48,250
made with beetroot
instead of artificial dyes.

594
00:37:48,791 --> 00:37:49,791
Hmm.

595
00:37:53,416 --> 00:37:54,416
Wow.

596
00:37:55,375 --> 00:37:57,250
You can really taste the beetroot.

597
00:37:57,333 --> 00:37:58,375
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

598
00:37:58,458 --> 00:38:01,041
You got your beet. You got your root.

599
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:03,750
All mixed in there.

600
00:38:04,666 --> 00:38:06,750
- Yes.
- Hey, have you seen our Stingy Jack?

601
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:07,875
No...

602
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:14,791
So the winner
of the pumpkin carving contest...

603
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,458
- Mm-hmm.
- ...gets placed on top as the head.

604
00:38:24,083 --> 00:38:26,000
I'm gonna go get
something to wash it down.

605
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,958
Whoo. Gets... gets you in a chokehold.

606
00:38:31,708 --> 00:38:33,416
So, what do you think?

607
00:38:35,833 --> 00:38:39,666
I think Crypt Keeper fairy girl
is one bird short of a cuckoo clock.

608
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:42,625
And that old lantern is clearly a pumpkin.

609
00:38:43,333 --> 00:38:46,500
Dad. Seriously?
What if Victoria's telling the truth?

610
00:38:46,583 --> 00:38:49,833
What if it wasn't Madam Hawthorne
I was talking to on that Ouija board?

611
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:53,875
What if it was Stingy Jack who tricked me
into finding his old lantern.

612
00:38:53,958 --> 00:38:56,708
Then, when I relit it,
I woke him up or let him out,

613
00:38:56,791 --> 00:39:00,041
and now he's making all
the Halloween decorations come to life.

614
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:01,750
Oh, come on, Syd.

615
00:39:01,833 --> 00:39:05,875
Halloween decorations coming to life?
That's just not something that happens.

616
00:39:10,541 --> 00:39:12,708
Now that is a great costume.

617
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:21,500
Kind of poor taste
for a nursing home though.

618
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,458
Nope, not today.

619
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,750
Oh, wow.

620
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,250
That looks just like
an Australian funnel-web spider.

621
00:39:40,833 --> 00:39:42,500
<i>Atrax robustus.</i>

622
00:39:43,083 --> 00:39:44,166
Um...

623
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:45,458
Is that bad?

624
00:39:45,541 --> 00:39:47,666
Well, it would be. If it was real.

625
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,583
Good thing these
are just plastic.

626
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:52,958
Boop!

627
00:40:03,708 --> 00:40:07,125
They're alive!

628
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:15,416
It's impossible.

629
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:21,083
Oh!

630
00:40:25,208 --> 00:40:26,208
Stay here.

631
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:31,875
Okay.

632
00:40:33,083 --> 00:40:34,625
Uh...

633
00:40:34,708 --> 00:40:35,875
Aha!

634
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:37,083
Ah!

635
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:39,416
Hey, Syd! Pop quiz.

636
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,291
What chemicals found
in common household cleaning supplies

637
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:46,000
can be combined
to create a highly acidic solvent?

638
00:40:46,083 --> 00:40:49,666
Maybe now is not the time
for a science lesson!

639
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:51,041
You got a good point there.

640
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,916
I had it set to "mist."

641
00:40:57,625 --> 00:41:00,208
It would've been
so much cooler if it was "spray."

642
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,166
Syd!

643
00:41:23,416 --> 00:41:24,666
Oh!

644
00:41:27,416 --> 00:41:28,791
Get out! Get out!

645
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:30,458
Go! Go! Go! Go!

646
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:32,666
Oh my God! Please help me.

647
00:41:36,291 --> 00:41:38,166
Hey, Death. He's older than me.

648
00:41:38,250 --> 00:41:42,166
The hydrogen peroxide
combines with the acetic acid in bleach

649
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:44,500
to make peracetic acid.

650
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:45,916
Super corrosive.

651
00:41:54,125 --> 00:41:55,125
Oh no.

652
00:41:57,750 --> 00:42:00,500
Wasn't there a giant spider on the roof
when we walked in?

653
00:42:09,166 --> 00:42:10,166
Syd!

654
00:42:12,583 --> 00:42:14,708
Come on. Come on!

655
00:42:16,791 --> 00:42:17,666
Oh sh...

656
00:42:33,833 --> 00:42:35,500
Whoa!

657
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,458
Okay. Easy, spider. Okay, listen.

658
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:47,666
I... I know you're pissed.

659
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,833
I hated the ending of <i>Charlotte's Web</i> too.

660
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:52,250
They did Charlotte dirty.
It should've been the pig.

661
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,291
Hey. Itsy-Bitsy.

662
00:43:20,958 --> 00:43:23,250
- We've got to get out of here.
- Okay.

663
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:27,333
Okay.

664
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:30,375
There's definitely something
unusual going on in Bridge Hollow.

665
00:43:30,458 --> 00:43:31,750
Oh, you think?

666
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:35,958
But there has to be
a logical, scientific explanation.

667
00:43:36,041 --> 00:43:38,750
Did you not just see
what happened in there?

668
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:43,791
No, I... I saw it.

669
00:43:45,083 --> 00:43:47,375
And clearly,
there's something crazy going on.

670
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,833
But just because it's crazy
doesn't mean it can't be explained.

671
00:43:51,916 --> 00:43:53,625
What are you talking about?

672
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,166
Dad, what is it?

673
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:04,041
It was Halloween 1985.

674
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,625
My friends and I,
we were out trick-or-treating

675
00:44:07,708 --> 00:44:10,083
when they dared me to go
into this abandoned building

676
00:44:10,166 --> 00:44:11,708
to prove I wasn't chicken.

677
00:44:11,791 --> 00:44:14,583
But I made a wrong step.
I fell through the floorboards

678
00:44:14,666 --> 00:44:16,083
into the basement.

679
00:44:16,666 --> 00:44:18,250
And that's when I saw them.

680
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:20,791
Skeletons.

681
00:44:21,583 --> 00:44:22,583
Hundreds.

682
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:25,333
They were everywhere.

683
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,166
And they were alive.

684
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,291
If that happened to you then,

685
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:32,375
why don't you think it's happening now?

686
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,458
Because it didn't happen to me.

687
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:38,416
A month later, I'm in science class.

688
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:43,708
My teacher tells us that a concussion
can cause temporary hallucinations.

689
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:45,333
And that was the answer.

690
00:44:45,416 --> 00:44:50,125
From that day on,
I knew everything had an explanation.

691
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:53,416
- It was science. Not magic.
- So...

692
00:44:54,208 --> 00:44:57,500
It's "eureka!" Not "abracadabra."

693
00:44:57,583 --> 00:45:01,000
Then explain to me
how Granddaddy Long Legs came alive

694
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:02,541
and tried to eat us.

695
00:45:03,541 --> 00:45:04,541
Well,

696
00:45:05,083 --> 00:45:08,541
maybe it was a gas leak
causing mass hallucinations.

697
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:11,458
Or maybe it's Stingy Jack.

698
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:16,416
Well, whatever it is...
it's spreading like a virus.

699
00:45:17,583 --> 00:45:18,625
Which makes sense.

700
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,666
Because it did start with a bat.

701
00:45:21,750 --> 00:45:25,250
Okay, hear me out. Let's just say
hypothetically, this is Jack.

702
00:45:25,333 --> 00:45:29,666
Victoria said her grandmother
trapped Jack inside that old lantern.

703
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Maybe we could do the same thing.

704
00:45:32,583 --> 00:45:35,458
- Re-trap him.
- Okay, let's say you're right.

705
00:45:35,541 --> 00:45:39,833
Hypothetically, how do we go about
doing something completely fictional

706
00:45:39,916 --> 00:45:41,833
and not at all real,
like trapping a ghost?

707
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:43,750
I don't know.

708
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:47,750
But... I know some kids who might.

709
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:53,750
<i>♪ I'm just an average man
With an average life ♪</i>

710
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:56,791
<i>♪ I work from 9 to 5
Hey, hell, I pay the price... ♪</i>

711
00:45:56,875 --> 00:45:58,500
All right, Syd. Stay close.

712
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:01,875
Syd. Syd. Sydney.

713
00:46:01,958 --> 00:46:03,416
That's not close!

714
00:46:04,041 --> 00:46:06,875
Hey, guys.
Thanks again for helping me tonight.

715
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:08,833
- Where are we?
- Here's what we know.

716
00:46:08,916 --> 00:46:11,083
If you wanna trap a ghost,
you're gonna need a spell.

717
00:46:11,166 --> 00:46:13,416
Preferably an old-world
Romani binding spell.

718
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:16,625
- Know any Gypsy witches?
- Not any that are still alive.

719
00:46:16,708 --> 00:46:18,958
Uh... Is that your dad?

720
00:46:19,041 --> 00:46:20,041
Sydney!

721
00:46:21,291 --> 00:46:22,125
Ah.

722
00:46:22,208 --> 00:46:23,291
Yeah.

723
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:26,708
Dad, guys. Guys, Dad.

724
00:46:26,791 --> 00:46:28,791
Hi. What's up, players?

725
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:30,875
Dap it up. Sideways. No?

726
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,041
No love? Okay.

727
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,875
I like the costumes.
Nice. Let me guess.

728
00:46:35,958 --> 00:46:38,375
Uh...
...Power Rangers.

729
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:40,125
Madonna.

730
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:43,125
Uh... Puerto Rican Prince.

731
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:44,708
You are so old.

732
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:47,000
So anything else?

733
00:46:47,083 --> 00:46:49,875
Yeah. I, uh, found this article online

734
00:46:49,958 --> 00:46:53,708
that says when Madam Hawthorne died,
they auctioned off some of her stuff.

735
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:57,500
One of the items listed is
her old grimoire. Spell book.

736
00:46:57,583 --> 00:46:58,583
I know.

737
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:02,541
That's it! Dad, we need that book.

738
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:04,875
Okay, Rico Suave,

739
00:47:05,541 --> 00:47:08,208
does the article say who bought it?

740
00:47:08,291 --> 00:47:11,875
Yeah. This... fancy-pants antiques dealer.

741
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:13,916
Sheldon Skinner.

742
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:16,375
Oh, wait, guys. Skinner's here.

743
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:20,083
Uh, he's wearing a Harvard sweatshirt
and some of those go-to-hell pants.

744
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:22,916
He bought tickets for the Kreepy Karnevil
in the pumpkin patch.

745
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,458
Then we have to split up.

746
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:26,166
Okay. Take these.

747
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,666
What are go-to-hell pants?
And am I wearing them?

748
00:47:34,125 --> 00:47:38,458
Did you really mean what you said earlier
about quitting the science team?

749
00:47:38,541 --> 00:47:41,791
Dad, I don't know.
It was really fun when I was younger,

750
00:47:41,875 --> 00:47:44,333
and it was obvious
you really wanted me to do it.

751
00:47:44,416 --> 00:47:46,583
Just like you really wanted me
to do karate.

752
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:50,208
Step right up, ladies and ghouls,
to a freak-tacular sideshow

753
00:47:50,291 --> 00:47:53,791
of thrills and chills,
here in the Kreepy Karnevil.

754
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:57,291
That's not how you spell
either of those words.

755
00:48:11,916 --> 00:48:12,916
Dad.

756
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:14,333
Look.

757
00:48:14,416 --> 00:48:16,500
That means Jack is here.

758
00:48:25,083 --> 00:48:26,750
What's wrong with you?

759
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:27,833
Why would you do that?

760
00:48:27,916 --> 00:48:29,166
I am so sorry.

761
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,791
We thought you were someone else.

762
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:32,041
Oh my God...

763
00:48:32,125 --> 00:48:34,833
Oh, baby. I know. Okay.

764
00:48:47,416 --> 00:48:49,125
Yeah, you never really liked clowns.

765
00:48:50,166 --> 00:48:52,375
Especially ones with axes.

766
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:00,958
Yeah.

767
00:49:05,583 --> 00:49:06,833
Wait, Syd!

768
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:09,166
They're just actors.

769
00:49:11,666 --> 00:49:12,666
Hey.

770
00:49:13,791 --> 00:49:16,708
I don't think you're allowed
to touch me unless I sign a waiver.

771
00:49:18,666 --> 00:49:20,166
Hey. Okay.

772
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,250
Let's calm down now.

773
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,416
Just knocked
your little infant friend out.

774
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:31,750
These aren't actors?

775
00:49:37,833 --> 00:49:39,458
Sydney, they aren't actors!

776
00:49:40,125 --> 00:49:43,458
Repeat! The clowns are not actors!

777
00:49:43,541 --> 00:49:45,750
So you no longer have the book.

778
00:49:45,833 --> 00:49:47,958
No, I sold it a while ago.

779
00:49:48,041 --> 00:49:50,333
I'd assumed Hawthorne's effects
were of some value,

780
00:49:50,416 --> 00:49:52,916
but apparently,
the only people who care about that junk

781
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,791
are nutjobs and occultists.

782
00:49:54,875 --> 00:49:56,458
No offense.

783
00:49:56,541 --> 00:49:59,500
When you say occultists,
you mean like Satanists?

784
00:49:59,583 --> 00:50:00,791
Not like.

785
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,291
Precisely.

786
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:05,125
Do you remember
the name of the person you sold it to?

787
00:50:05,208 --> 00:50:06,958
No, I don't remember his name,

788
00:50:07,708 --> 00:50:10,750
but he had a shipping address
I will never forget.

789
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:14,416
666 Elm Street.

790
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:19,041
Like I said, nutjobs.

791
00:50:20,708 --> 00:50:22,428
Let's go
to the ticket booth first.

792
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,625
- If she's not there...
- Killer clowns! Killer clowns!

793
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:28,583
- Uh, Sydney, what's going on?
- Stingy Jack! He's here!

794
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:29,750
- What?
- Where?

795
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:31,416
Everywhere!

796
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:35,875
Syd! No!

797
00:50:36,458 --> 00:50:38,458
It's called the Halls of Horror.

798
00:50:38,541 --> 00:50:41,333
Why couldn't you just go
to the pumpkin patch?

799
00:50:56,583 --> 00:50:57,666
It's a dead end.

800
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:07,416
Guys! Over here!

801
00:51:11,875 --> 00:51:13,083
Okay. Which way?

802
00:51:13,166 --> 00:51:14,583
Eeny, meeny, miney...

803
00:51:15,666 --> 00:51:17,041
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

804
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:25,916
Sydney!

805
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:27,000
Dad?

806
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,083
Sydney!

807
00:51:34,875 --> 00:51:35,875
Dad!

808
00:51:36,708 --> 00:51:37,708
Sydney!

809
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:40,958
Dad?

810
00:51:42,583 --> 00:51:43,666
Dad?

811
00:51:45,125 --> 00:51:47,375
Hey! Hey. It's me. It's me.

812
00:51:48,041 --> 00:51:49,166
Dad!

813
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,666
- It's okay, kiddo.
- Look, there's an exit sign.

814
00:51:52,750 --> 00:51:53,625
We're almost out.

815
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:02,000
All right. Back up. Back up.

816
00:52:02,791 --> 00:52:05,916
Okay, Bozo. I'm gonna wipe
that crooked smile right off your face.

817
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,208
Come on. Come on.
Let you know, Homey don't play that.

818
00:52:12,708 --> 00:52:13,750
Oh!

819
00:52:14,958 --> 00:52:16,041
Dad!

820
00:52:19,625 --> 00:52:20,750
Get him.

821
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:22,166
Ow!

822
00:52:32,041 --> 00:52:33,375
Oh, night night!

823
00:52:33,458 --> 00:52:34,791
Oh, oh! Nice!

824
00:52:35,791 --> 00:52:39,125
You know, I softened him up for you,
but, uh, way to finish the job.

825
00:52:39,208 --> 00:52:40,208
Sure, you did.

826
00:52:40,708 --> 00:52:41,791
Um, guys?

827
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:44,333
Hey.

828
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:48,041
Why does a clown need an axe anyway?

829
00:52:48,125 --> 00:52:49,125
Go!

830
00:52:51,708 --> 00:52:55,000
To the right! That way!
We parked out front.

831
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:03,708
- Okay, now what?
- Um, plan B. Bikes!

832
00:53:03,791 --> 00:53:06,666
Well, that would be great
if my dad knew how to ride a bike.

833
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:09,250
You don't know how to ride a bike?

834
00:53:09,333 --> 00:53:11,708
I was taught books could take me
wherever I needed to go.

835
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,500
Okay, bikes it is. Go! Go! Go!

836
00:53:22,416 --> 00:53:24,208
This thing is growing exponentially.

837
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:28,458
Each creature spreads it to another,
which spreads it to another and another.

838
00:53:28,541 --> 00:53:31,017
At its current rate, it'll take over
Bridge Hollow by midnight.

839
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:35,041
And according to Victoria,
if we can't stop Jack by then,

840
00:53:35,125 --> 00:53:37,208
he could find a soul to swap for his own.

841
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:39,166
Then every day will be Halloween.

842
00:53:39,250 --> 00:53:41,125
- Maybe we should call the police.
- Dad.

843
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:44,041
Do you really think
the cops are going to believe any of this?

844
00:53:44,125 --> 00:53:46,833
- You didn't even believe it.
- Because it doesn't make sense.

845
00:53:46,916 --> 00:53:48,916
Not everything has to, Dad.

846
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:54,500
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

847
00:53:54,583 --> 00:53:58,416
Who will be the face
of this year's Stingy Jack?

848
00:53:59,666 --> 00:54:01,333
And the winner is...

849
00:54:02,583 --> 00:54:04,333
Dan Brown!

850
00:54:05,458 --> 00:54:08,166
Oh my God! Oh my God!

851
00:54:08,250 --> 00:54:11,875
In your face, Gary! In your face!

852
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:14,708
I did it, Ma! I did it!

853
00:54:14,791 --> 00:54:17,916
We gotta! We gotta!

854
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,916
- Tammy...
- No, no, no, no.

855
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:22,458
Now let's get this guy up
on old Stingy Jack.

856
00:54:23,875 --> 00:54:25,833

866
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:50,041
- Okay, this is it.
- No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

867
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:55,875
Okay.

868
00:54:57,625 --> 00:55:00,541
I'm gonna assume... that wasn't intentional.

869
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:07,041
Bones.

870
00:55:08,541 --> 00:55:10,500
Why does it have to be bones?

871
00:55:11,416 --> 00:55:14,041
Um... You know, maybe...
maybe I'll just stay right here.

872
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:16,000
What? No, come on.

873
00:55:28,583 --> 00:55:29,833
Whoa!

874
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,041
Okay.

875
00:55:38,125 --> 00:55:39,291
Are we sure about this?

876
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,541
I've never met
a real devil worshiper before.

877
00:55:42,625 --> 00:55:44,750
Should we be wearing
crucifixes or something?

878
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:46,333
Only one way to find out.

879
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,541
Principal Floyd?

880
00:55:56,625 --> 00:56:00,250
Well, hey there, everyone.
And, Howard, what a pleasant surprise.

881
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:01,791
You all trick-or-treating tonight?

882
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:04,750
Well, you're in luck
because this year, I've got...

883
00:56:06,083 --> 00:56:08,125
miniature toothpastes.

884
00:56:11,833 --> 00:56:13,666
<i>♪ I put a spell on you... ♪</i>

885
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:18,791
- So, uh, Floyd.
- Uh-huh.

886
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:20,791
What are you some type
of Satanist or something?

887
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:23,958
- Oh jeepers. No, Howard.
- What the hell?

888
00:56:24,041 --> 00:56:28,500
I'm a principal in a very small town
with a very big Christian population.

889
00:56:28,583 --> 00:56:31,125
No, no, no. I just, uh, collect things.

890
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:34,916
You know, some people collect stamps.
Some people collect butterflies.

891
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,458
I collect objects

892
00:56:36,541 --> 00:56:39,375
related to the eternal damnation
of the human soul.

893
00:56:39,958 --> 00:56:40,958
Aha!

894
00:56:41,416 --> 00:56:44,625
I believe this...
is what you're looking for.

895
00:56:46,916 --> 00:56:47,916
Okay, here it is.

896
00:56:48,416 --> 00:56:50,541
<i>"Captus Exspiravit."</i>

897
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:53,916
<i>"Cum his verbis O spiritus."</i>

898
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:56,083
Dad. You know Latin. What does it say?

899
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,250
With these words, O spirit,

900
00:57:01,833 --> 00:57:04,250
I banish you to captivity

901
00:57:04,333 --> 00:57:07,250
binding you to blah, blah, blah, blah...

902
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:08,791
Right on. So how does it work?

903
00:57:08,875 --> 00:57:11,166
Well, it's your typical,
run-of-the-mill binding spell.

904
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:15,250
You find a nice receptacle, right?
Then you get close enough to your target.

905
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:16,541
Be careful.

906
00:57:16,625 --> 00:57:19,750
Then you say these magic words, and boom.

907
00:57:19,833 --> 00:57:22,875
- You've trapped yourself a ghost.
- How close do we need to get?

908
00:57:23,458 --> 00:57:24,958
I don't know. I mean, look,

909
00:57:25,041 --> 00:57:27,791
there's no hard-and-fast rules
with these things.

910
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:29,458
I do know this.

911
00:57:29,541 --> 00:57:32,750
When you say this spell,
you have to believe it.

912
00:57:32,833 --> 00:57:36,041
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, truly believe it.

913
00:57:38,708 --> 00:57:40,416
In your bones.

914
00:57:52,458 --> 00:57:54,125
Please tell me you ordered pizza.

915
00:57:59,625 --> 00:58:01,083
Oh, you must not tip well.

916
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:17,750
Let's go, move it.

917
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:36,000
- You just had to put helmets on them?
- I thought it would be cute.

918
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:51,666
Sydney! Save the grimoire!

919
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:07,208
Get the book out of here.

920
00:59:13,166 --> 00:59:14,416
Syd!

921
00:59:18,375 --> 00:59:19,375
I got it!

922
00:59:31,666 --> 00:59:32,875
The spell!

923
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:35,500
- We gotta get out of here.
- We can get out the back.

924
00:59:35,583 --> 00:59:39,125
No! Dad, we have to get that spell.
It's the only way we can fix this.

925
00:59:39,208 --> 00:59:42,708
We can't fix anything if we're dead.
Now, come on and bring your little ass.

926
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:47,708
- Let's go! Let's go! Come on!
- Hurry!

927
00:59:51,083 --> 00:59:52,541
Go! Get in the basement!

928
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:53,750
Go! Go! Go!

929
00:59:53,833 --> 00:59:56,000
Get in the basement!

930
00:59:56,083 --> 00:59:58,166
- Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

931
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:08,458
Mario, help him!

932
01:00:12,833 --> 01:00:14,583
Dad. Do something!

933
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,541
Dad! What is wrong with you?

934
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:26,125
The skeletons.

935
01:00:26,208 --> 01:00:28,125
- They're coming through.
- What do we do?

936
01:00:29,250 --> 01:00:30,875
So it's unexplainable.

937
01:00:30,958 --> 01:00:33,875
So what? They're real.

938
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,791
You know what you can do
to something that's real?

939
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:41,583
You can kick its ass.

940
01:00:46,416 --> 01:00:48,333
You can take the girl out of Brooklyn,

941
01:00:48,416 --> 01:00:50,583
but you can't take Brooklyn
out the girl.

942
01:00:57,083 --> 01:00:59,333
Hey, Syd! Pop quiz.

943
01:00:59,416 --> 01:01:02,166
You know what the chainsaw
was originally called?

944
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:10,583
A bone cutter.

945
01:01:15,583 --> 01:01:16,416
Yeah.

946
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:19,500
This will do just fine.

01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:29,750
Whoo!

957
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:33,958
Whoo, whoo, whoo. Whoo!

958
01:02:37,416 --> 01:02:38,458
Ah!

959
01:02:45,416 --> 01:02:47,000
Ahhh!

960
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,583
Ahhh!

961
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:57,166
Holy Lucifer, Howard.

962
01:03:00,541 --> 01:03:03,833
Sydney, I take back
everything I said about your dad.

963
01:03:05,041 --> 01:03:07,791
That was the coolest thing
I've ever seen in my whole life.

964
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,666
Boy, I hope somebody
remembers these words.

965
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:28,958
What was that?

966
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:46,125
The Halloween decorations.
They're gone.

967
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:47,750
But where did they go?

968
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:49,875
The Stingy Jack Festival.

969
01:03:49,958 --> 01:03:51,333
He's building an army.

970
01:03:52,625 --> 01:03:53,625
Mom.

971
01:03:54,083 --> 01:03:56,083
These right here, Father,

972
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:59,583
are egg-free coconut-pineapple scones.

973
01:03:59,666 --> 01:04:02,083
- Ah, that's a home run, huh?
- Yes!

974
01:04:07,041 --> 01:04:08,541
So...

975
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:12,416
I'm really not supposed to lie.

976
01:04:14,083 --> 01:04:16,041
Yeah! Love it!

977
01:04:16,125 --> 01:04:17,041
Mm-mm.

978
01:04:17,125 --> 01:04:19,333
Oh, there's our pumpkin. Come on!

979
01:04:22,666 --> 01:04:26,125
Well... guess it's time
to call it a night.

980
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,291
Let's hear it for Stingy Jack!

981
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:35,458
Stingy Jack.
Stingy Jack. Stingy Jack.

982
01:04:39,333 --> 01:04:40,750
Which way do we go?

983
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:45,291
It's still a few more blocks that way.

984
01:04:45,375 --> 01:04:47,833
Or we can take the shortcut.
Through the cemetery.

985
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:49,416
Okay. Let's go.

986
01:04:51,125 --> 01:04:54,041
Oh, please tell me
they don't decorate the cemeteries here.

987
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:06,333
Hey, Syd. What are you doing?

988
01:05:06,416 --> 01:05:09,041
- Come on, we have to find your mom.
- And then what, Dad?

989
01:05:09,125 --> 01:05:12,125
Stingy Jack has completely taken over
Bridge Hollow.

990
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:15,750
And without Madam Hawthorne's spell,
we can't stop him.

991
01:05:15,833 --> 01:05:17,375
We need that spell.

992
01:05:18,166 --> 01:05:19,291
What are you thinking?

993
01:05:26,125 --> 01:05:27,583
I don't know, guys.

994
01:05:27,666 --> 01:05:31,458
I led the weekend séance
at the community center a few times,

995
01:05:31,541 --> 01:05:32,666
but that was years ago.

996
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,833
Please, you have to try.

997
01:05:34,916 --> 01:05:38,041
Okay. Um, everybody, take hands.

998
01:05:38,958 --> 01:05:41,291
Oh! I can't believe I'm doing this.

999
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:46,166
But I am so here for it.

1000
01:05:46,250 --> 01:05:49,833
You know, channeling the... energy.

1001
01:05:49,916 --> 01:05:51,625
- Whatever.
- Thank you.

1002
01:05:53,208 --> 01:05:54,291
Close your eyes.

1003
01:05:55,041 --> 01:05:57,916
Uh, now again,
I'm very much out of practice...

1004
01:06:04,416 --> 01:06:05,333
Everyone.

1005
01:06:23,541 --> 01:06:24,750
Whoa.

1006
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:26,583
Miss Hawthorne?

1007
01:06:28,291 --> 01:06:30,166
Miss Josephine Hawthorne.

1008
01:06:31,041 --> 01:06:32,333
Are you in here?

1009
01:06:33,375 --> 01:06:34,791
Can you hear me?

1010
01:06:34,875 --> 01:06:37,208
Of course I hear you, child.

1011
01:06:39,625 --> 01:06:42,708
I'm not deaf.
I'm dead.

1012
01:06:46,166 --> 01:06:49,375
Hell's bells, what have I done?

1013
01:06:49,458 --> 01:06:51,166
This is so going on TikTok.

1014
01:06:51,250 --> 01:06:53,500
Um, I released Stingy Jack.

1015
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:55,375
You did what?

1016
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:58,375
It is my honor as mayor of Bridge Hollow

1017
01:06:58,458 --> 01:07:01,333
to light this year's Stingy Jack.

1018
01:07:01,416 --> 01:07:03,583
Yeah. Light it up!

1019
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:08,041
What on earth?

1020
01:07:08,125 --> 01:07:09,851
- Not good.
- What's going on?

1021
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:12,958
All right, everyone.
Must have just blown a fuse or something.

1022
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:16,166
- Is somebody trippin'?
- That is weird.

1023
01:07:18,625 --> 01:07:20,625
What the H-E-C-K is that?

1024
01:07:34,041 --> 01:07:35,625
Is this part of the show?

1025
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:36,916
Beats me, Father.

1026
01:07:45,875 --> 01:07:48,583
I can't believe
you nitwits

1027
01:07:48,666 --> 01:07:50,458
brought that dusty old demon back to life.

1028
01:07:50,541 --> 01:07:53,791
What are you going to do next?
Bring back the black plague?

1029
01:07:53,875 --> 01:07:54,875
I don't know.

1030
01:07:54,958 --> 01:07:56,875
You realize
he's going to try to do it again?

1031
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:58,583
To find a soul to take back

1032
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:01,500
and trade with the devil
so he can take over the world?

1033
01:08:01,583 --> 01:08:04,833
But this time,
he won't let anyone stop him.

1034
01:08:04,916 --> 01:08:06,708
We can stop him.

1035
01:08:06,791 --> 01:08:08,416
Oh!

1036
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,708
And how do you propose to do this?

1037
01:08:11,208 --> 01:08:13,291
You gonna hit him
with your little broomstick?

1038
01:08:13,791 --> 01:08:15,583
- Cast a little spell?
- Exactly.

1039
01:08:16,583 --> 01:08:18,291
The binding spell from your book.

1040
01:08:18,375 --> 01:08:21,333
If you tell us the words,
we can use it to re-trap Jack

1041
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:23,958
and put him away... forever.

1042
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:28,941
As you wish.

1043
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:33,500
<i>Cum his verbis O spiritus</i>

1044
01:08:33,583 --> 01:08:36,958
<i>te ad captivitatem eccio.</i>

1045
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:37,958
<i>Captivitatem.</i>

1046
01:08:38,041 --> 01:08:42,416
<i>Adligans te ad flammam diabalit.</i>

1047
01:08:43,250 --> 01:08:44,250
Got it.

1048
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:45,458
Mm-hmm.

1049
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:49,541
Good for you.
Now can I please go back to being dead?

1050
01:08:52,791 --> 01:08:54,333
Oh, uh, yes, I'm sorry.

1051
01:08:59,041 --> 01:09:00,281
Uh...

1052
01:09:00,333 --> 01:09:03,250
Oh, for the love of...
Where did you learn this?

1053
01:09:03,333 --> 01:09:04,666
From a Cracker Jack box?

1054
01:09:04,750 --> 01:09:05,750
Amateurs.

1055
01:09:14,625 --> 01:09:17,041
- What just happened?
- Huh?

1056
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:21,250
Why do I smell like an old white lady?

1057
01:09:22,250 --> 01:09:24,000
I know what's going on here.

1058
01:09:24,083 --> 01:09:28,458
It's those degenerates from Oaktown
trying to sabotage our festival again.

1059
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:30,458
Well, not this year.

1060
01:09:31,458 --> 01:09:32,458
Nuh-uh.

1061
01:09:33,333 --> 01:09:35,875
You can't hide behind that mask.

1062
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:38,708
I could smell
an Oaktownie from a mile away.

1063
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,541
You know why?

1064
01:09:40,625 --> 01:09:43,875
Because you reek of sour grapes.

1065
01:09:43,958 --> 01:09:47,000
- It's a bunch of Oaktownies.
- We don't want you here.

1066
01:09:47,083 --> 01:09:49,791
We don't want any of you weird freaks.

1067
01:09:57,416 --> 01:09:59,333
You shouldn't have done that, clown boy.

1068
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:10,500
- They're everywhere.
- I'm starting to hate Halloween.

1069
01:10:10,583 --> 01:10:11,958
We got this.

1070
01:10:13,583 --> 01:10:15,333
Oh, Syd. Look. Over there.

1071
01:10:15,416 --> 01:10:17,625
Mom's booth. Come on.

1072
01:10:18,791 --> 01:10:20,541
Quiet. Quiet.

1073
01:10:37,291 --> 01:10:38,500
Oh, dear Lord.

1074
01:10:39,916 --> 01:10:42,000
Where is she? Where's Mom?

1075
01:10:42,083 --> 01:10:43,166
I don't know!

1076
01:10:43,250 --> 01:10:45,291
And where's all the muffins
and cookies and stuff?

1077
01:10:45,375 --> 01:10:47,666
Maybe she sold them all
and then went home.

1078
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:52,625
Okay, Syd. Pop quiz.

1079
01:10:53,833 --> 01:10:56,625
Where is
the big pumpkin-headed statue thing

1080
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,333
that was there just a minute ago?

1081
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:01,875
He's gone.

1082
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,458
What time is it?

1083
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:06,583
It's almost midnight.

1084
01:11:06,625 --> 01:11:09,916
Dad, we need to find Jack
before he takes someone's soul

1085
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:12,666
back to the spirit world,
or else we're screwed.

1086
01:11:12,750 --> 01:11:13,750
No, he can't.

1087
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:16,250
If he wants to trade a soul
with the devil,

1088
01:11:16,333 --> 01:11:18,166
he needs the lantern.

1089
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:20,375
And the lantern is back at the...

1090
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,250
Hello?

1091
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:03,041
I'm trippin'. I'm trippin'.

1092
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:08,958
So no one wants my baked goods.

1093
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:13,000
Well, more for me.

1094
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:14,625
Mmm.

1095
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:21,666
Dad.

1096
01:12:21,750 --> 01:12:23,208
- What?
- What are you doing?

1097
01:12:23,291 --> 01:12:25,541
I'm looking for wheels.

1098
01:12:25,625 --> 01:12:28,625
A car, a truck, something.

1099
01:12:29,333 --> 01:12:30,333
Anything.

1100
01:12:32,875 --> 01:12:34,208
I don't know.

1101
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:43,416
Check for keys. Check.

1102
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:45,541
- Okay. Come on...
- Nothing.

1103
01:12:46,166 --> 01:12:48,833
Hey. Never do this.

1104
01:12:51,375 --> 01:12:54,458
Bypassing the ignition
allows the positively charged battery

1105
01:12:54,541 --> 01:12:58,833
to push the negatively charged electrons
to the starter and...

1106
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,875
Eureka.

1107
01:13:00,958 --> 01:13:02,416
Mm-hmm.

1108
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,166
Don't tell Mom about this.

1109
01:13:07,958 --> 01:13:08,958
All right.

1110
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:10,583
Let's go.

1111
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:18,500
What are they doing?

1112
01:13:19,250 --> 01:13:20,625
Why are they just standing there?

1113
01:13:21,125 --> 01:13:24,500
The last time Jack tried to steal a soul,
Madam Hawthorne stopped him.

1114
01:13:24,583 --> 01:13:28,208
So this time, he's using his army
to make sure no one gets in his way.

1115
01:13:28,291 --> 01:13:30,708
He'll keep us here till midnight
then attack.

1116
01:13:30,791 --> 01:13:33,875
Yeah. Well, lucky for us,
we're driving this <i>Cucurbita pepo</i>.

1117
01:13:33,958 --> 01:13:36,916
- Or, in layman's terms...
- A squash.

1118
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:38,000
Hang on.

1119
01:13:54,208 --> 01:13:55,875
Oh, here comes Charlotte!

1120
01:14:01,958 --> 01:14:02,875
Oh!

1121
01:14:04,375 --> 01:14:07,250
Well, there goes
this year's safest small town in the US.

1122
01:14:07,875 --> 01:14:08,875
Yes!

1123
01:14:09,416 --> 01:14:10,416
Whoo!

1124
01:14:23,916 --> 01:14:25,708
That is really hard.

1125
01:14:26,291 --> 01:14:27,666
Ugh.

1126
01:15:05,125 --> 01:15:08,875
Brains. Brains.

1127
01:15:10,916 --> 01:15:13,916
Brains. Brains.

1128
01:15:15,416 --> 01:15:17,375
<i>Cum his verbis O spiritus...</i>

1129
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:20,041
<i>Cum his verbis O spiritus.</i>

1130
01:15:20,125 --> 01:15:22,416
I tried to get you to learn Latin.
Remember?

1131
01:15:22,500 --> 01:15:27,416
Dad, Latin is literally a dead language,
and at that time, it seemed useless.

1132
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,833
Well, it's not so useless now, is it?

1133
01:16:00,875 --> 01:16:02,166
- You ready? Okay.
- Ready.

1134
01:16:02,708 --> 01:16:04,333
- Hi, neighbor!
- Oh!

1135
01:16:04,416 --> 01:16:07,333
Wondering what I'm doing
in your bushes, right?

1136
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:09,416
I'm not hiding if that's what you think.

1137
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:11,500
- Yeah, you are.
- I'm not scared of anything.

1138
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,503
- You know what I mean? All right.
- That's nice.

1139
01:16:13,916 --> 01:16:16,458
Hey, turns out you were right.
I didn't turn into a zombie, huh?

1140
01:16:16,541 --> 01:16:18,458
- Lucky you.
- Halloween, baby.

1141
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:48,083
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh...

1142
01:16:48,166 --> 01:16:49,333
It's your husband!

1143
01:16:49,916 --> 01:16:52,875
- Honey?
- What was in that muffin? Cement?

1144
01:16:52,958 --> 01:16:54,708
I get it. I get it. Baking isn't...

1145
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:56,125
Look out!

1146
01:16:58,666 --> 01:16:59,666
Mom!

1147
01:17:09,541 --> 01:17:11,000
He breathes fire now?

1148
01:17:14,083 --> 01:17:15,083
Come on.

1149
01:17:15,583 --> 01:17:19,541
Oh! Syd! Back up! Back up! Back up!

1150
01:17:19,625 --> 01:17:21,125
Okay. All right.

1151
01:17:21,666 --> 01:17:23,541
You distract the bat. I'll save Mom.

1152
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:25,500
But, Dad, I have to do the spell.

1153
01:17:25,583 --> 01:17:28,250
Listen. It is too dangerous in there.

1154
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:34,000
Now, I am still your father,
and sometimes I still need to protect you.

1155
01:17:35,458 --> 01:17:36,458
Okay?

1156
01:17:53,833 --> 01:17:56,000
- Go! Save Mom! I got this.
- Okay.

1157
01:18:01,291 --> 01:18:03,416
All right, Oaktownies! Come get some!

1158
01:18:07,208 --> 01:18:09,208
I don't think
you should be encouraging them, dear.

1159
01:18:09,291 --> 01:18:12,000
Don't get some! Don't get some!
I changed my mind.

1160
01:18:12,083 --> 01:18:13,083
Stay back!

1161
01:18:13,583 --> 01:18:16,416
I'm thinking these things
ain't from Oaktown.

1162
01:18:21,666 --> 01:18:23,375
Dad! Hurry!

1163
01:18:23,958 --> 01:18:25,416
We're running out of time!

1164
01:18:30,458 --> 01:18:31,916
Ow.

1165
01:18:37,125 --> 01:18:38,625
All right, rat-face.

1166
01:18:39,125 --> 01:18:42,250
Round two. Ding ding.

1167
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,750
Oh no! No!

1168
01:18:51,500 --> 01:18:52,541
Let me go!

1169
01:18:52,625 --> 01:18:53,666
Let me go!

1170
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,041
Let me go!

1171
01:18:58,208 --> 01:18:59,083
I got you.

1172
01:18:59,166 --> 01:19:01,500
<i>Cum his verbis O spiritus</i>

1173
01:19:01,583 --> 01:19:04,916
<i>te ad captivitatem eccio.</i>

1174
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,666
<i>Adligans te ad flammam diabalit.</i>

1175
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,375
<i>Cum his verbis O spiritus</i>

1176
01:19:14,458 --> 01:19:17,416
<i>te ad captivitatem eccio.</i>

1177
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:22,166
<i>Adligans te ad flammam diabalit.</i>

1178
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:26,500
- Howard!
- I'm trying.

1179
01:19:27,375 --> 01:19:29,291
Dad, hurry!

1180
01:19:29,375 --> 01:19:31,375
At midnight his army is going to attack!

1181
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:35,125
I've said the spell!
Twice! It's not working!

1182
01:19:35,208 --> 01:19:37,416
You have to truly believe!

1183
01:19:41,875 --> 01:19:44,375
Dad! You can do it! I know you can!

1184
01:19:51,375 --> 01:19:53,583
Now cast that frigging spell!

1185
01:19:56,125 --> 01:19:57,916
With these words, O spirit,

1186
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,833
I banish you to captivity...

1187
01:20:00,916 --> 01:20:03,375
...binding you to the devil's flame!

1188
01:20:20,875 --> 01:20:22,000
Abracadabra.

1189
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:51,375
- They did it!
- They trapped him!

1190
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:54,250
Oh, thank God.
I thought they were screwed for sure.

1191
01:21:00,250 --> 01:21:01,583
You see that?

1192
01:21:01,666 --> 01:21:04,083
I'm on a new team, baby!

1193
01:21:04,166 --> 01:21:05,708
Welcome, son.

1194
01:21:05,791 --> 01:21:07,958
Thank you.

1195
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:14,041
Well-done, Oaktown. Well-done.

1196
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:16,333
We'll see you next year.

1197
01:21:16,416 --> 01:21:17,750
See you next year.

1198
01:21:36,333 --> 01:21:37,333
Oh!

1199
01:21:41,208 --> 01:21:43,083
- That's funny?
- Yes.

1200
01:21:46,875 --> 01:21:48,000
So long, Jack.

1201
01:21:53,666 --> 01:21:54,875
Wow, Mr. Gordon.

1202
01:21:54,958 --> 01:21:58,791
I mean, I just wish I could've been there
to see you whip Stingy Jack's ass.

1203
01:21:59,583 --> 01:22:02,250
Sorry, I meant "butt."

1204
01:22:02,333 --> 01:22:04,541
Nah, that's okay. I did whoop his ass.

1205
01:22:06,666 --> 01:22:10,333
I meant, <i>we</i> whooped his ass.
It was a team effort.

1206
01:22:10,416 --> 01:22:13,166
All right, who wants some cinnamon rolls?

1207
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,500
Whoo!

1208
01:22:14,583 --> 01:22:16,750
- Thank you!
- Good luck.

1209
01:22:17,875 --> 01:22:19,208
Wow!

1210
01:22:19,291 --> 01:22:20,541
These are amazing.

1211
01:22:20,625 --> 01:22:22,708
- Incredible.
- They are?

1212
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:24,375
You should open a shop, Mrs. Gordon.

1213
01:22:24,458 --> 01:22:25,666
Wait a second.

1214
01:22:25,750 --> 01:22:26,833
Hmm.

1215
01:22:29,125 --> 01:22:30,416
Yo, what'd you put in this?

1216
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:31,958
Butter, sugar, gluten.

1217
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:36,291
I figured, after last night,
life's too short.

1218
01:22:37,166 --> 01:22:39,708
I'm just happy that Halloween is over.

1219
01:22:39,791 --> 01:22:41,541
You thought last night was crazy?

1220
01:22:41,625 --> 01:22:43,791
You should see
what this town does for Christmas.

1221
01:22:45,458 --> 01:22:46,541
Christmas?

1222
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:49,416
Ho ho ho.

1223
01:22:52,625 --> 01:22:56,000
I still say we should destroy that thing
and be done with it.

1224
01:22:56,083 --> 01:22:57,750
Dad, we went over this.

1225
01:22:57,833 --> 01:22:59,791
If we destroy the lantern, we...

1226
01:22:59,875 --> 01:23:02,416
We could release Jack again.
I know. I know.

1227
01:23:03,125 --> 01:23:05,250
But see, that's why I got this.

1228
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:06,958
Ammonium phosphate.

1229
01:23:07,041 --> 01:23:08,083
Flame retardant.

1230
01:23:10,833 --> 01:23:12,458
Better be safe than sorry.

1231
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:14,625
Sounds like someone's a believer.

1232
01:23:14,708 --> 01:23:17,041
Hey.

1233
01:23:18,041 --> 01:23:19,041
Here.

1234
01:23:19,083 --> 01:23:21,166
You want me to lock it?

1235
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:24,666
Yeah, and then I want you
to take the key and keep it safe.

1236
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:28,500
You're old enough now.
You're old enough to do a lot of things.

1237
01:23:29,875 --> 01:23:31,833
And I'mma try my best to remember that.

1238
01:23:33,083 --> 01:23:34,083
Thanks, Dad.
