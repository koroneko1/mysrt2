THE PAY WASN'T

59:34.779 --> 59:36.990
THAT BAD EITHER.

59:36.990 --> 59:38.492
OK, PUT THAT DOWN.

59:38.492 --> 59:39.576
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

59:39.576 --> 59:41.412
WHAT IS IT?

59:41.412 --> 59:43.788
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

59:41.412 --> 59:43.788
IT'S A DOG IN THE SUNSHINE.

59:43.788 --> 59:44.998
IT DOESN'T

59:43.788 --> 59:44.998
LOOK LIKE ONE.

59:44.998 --> 59:46.791
THAT'S BECAUSE

59:44.998 --> 59:46.791
IT'S KINDA ABSTRACT.

59:46.791 --> 59:49.336
YOU HAVE TO SQUINT

59:46.791 --> 59:49.336
WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT.

59:46.791 --> 59:49.336
SQUINT AND LOOK AND SEE.

59:49.336 --> 59:51.588
AND WHEN YOU

59:49.336 --> 59:51.588
SEE IT LIKE THIS,

59:51.588 --> 59:52.797
THAT'S ABSTRACT.

59:52.797 --> 59:55.259
YEAH? YOU SEE IT?

59:55.259 --> 59:57.302
HOW ABOUT IF YOU TILT

59:55.259 --> 59:57.302
YOUR HEAD TO THE SIDE?

59:57.302 --> 59:59.304
NO, THE OTHER WAY.

59:59.304 --> 1:00:00.597
STILL DOESN'T LOOK LIKE ONE.

1:00:00.597 --> 1:00:03.183
OK, WELL, WHAT ARE YOU

1:00:00.597 --> 1:00:03.183
OVER THERE WORKING ON,

1:00:00.597 --> 1:00:03.183
MICHELANGELO?

1:00:03.183 --> 1:00:04.268
WHAT YOU GOT?

1:00:04.268 --> 1:00:05.519
WHAT IS THAT?

1:00:13.985 --> 1:00:17.197
THERE'S NOTHING ABSTRACT

1:00:13.985 --> 1:00:17.197
ABOUT THAT, NOW, IS IT?

1:00:17.197 --> 1:00:18.323
THANKS.

1:00:19.491 --> 1:00:21.159
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:23.620
YOU GOT DADDY'S HEAD

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:23.620
LOOKING KIND OF ROUND, THOUGH.

1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:25.581
IS MY HEAD THAT ROUND?

1:00:25.581 --> 1:00:27.624
NO. BUT I GOT

1:00:25.581 --> 1:00:27.624
YOUR MUSTACHE.

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:30.294
YEAH, I SEE.

1:00:27.624 --> 1:00:30.294
A NICE GREEN MUSTACHE.

1:00:30.294 --> 1:00:32.421
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, SON.

1:00:32.421 --> 1:00:33.922
ALL RIGHT,

1:00:32.421 --> 1:00:33.922
I JUST PAID THE MORTGAGE,

1:00:33.922 --> 1:00:36.133
THE CAR LOAN

1:00:33.922 --> 1:00:36.133
AND THE ELECTRIC BILL.

1:00:36.133 --> 1:00:38.718
LOOK AT THE BALANCE

1:00:36.133 --> 1:00:38.718
IN THE CHECKING ACCOUNT.

1:00:38.718 --> 1:00:40.845
74 CENTS.

1:00:40.845 --> 1:00:42.722
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT,

1:00:40.845 --> 1:00:42.722
74 CENTS.

1:00:42.722 --> 1:00:44.266
YOU ARE MY SUPERMAN.

1:00:44.266 --> 1:00:45.683
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

1:00:45.683 --> 1:00:46.851
I'VE BEEN WORKING HARD,

1:00:46.851 --> 1:00:49.521
AND I THINK IT'S TIME

1:00:46.851 --> 1:00:49.521
TO LET OFF A LITTLE

1:00:46.851 --> 1:00:49.521
OF THIS FRUSTRATION I HAVE.

1:00:49.521 --> 1:00:52.274
IT'S TIME FOR YOU

1:00:49.521 --> 1:00:52.274
TO, UH, TAKE CARE

1:00:49.521 --> 1:00:52.274
OF YOUR SUPERMAN.

1:00:52.274 --> 1:00:53.733
MY SUPERMAN.

1:00:52.274 --> 1:00:53.733
COME HERE, BABY.

1:00:53.733 --> 1:00:54.859
THAT'S RIGHT.

1:00:54.859 --> 1:00:58.447
[Ben]

1:00:54.859 --> 1:00:58.447
OH, NO, THE MONSTER'S

1:00:54.859 --> 1:00:58.447
GOING TO GET ME! OH, NO!

1:00:58.447 --> 1:00:59.573
[sighs]

1:01:00.616 --> 1:01:02.576
IT'S PROBABLY A NIGHTMARE.

1:01:02.576 --> 1:01:04.495
[grunts]

1:01:02.576 --> 1:01:04.495
BE RIGHT BACK.

1:01:04.495 --> 1:01:06.871
OK, HURRY UP.

1:01:04.495 --> 1:01:06.871
MOMMY'S COMING!

1:01:06.871 --> 1:01:08.957
[Ben]

1:01:06.871 --> 1:01:08.957
NO, I WANT DADDY.

1:01:10.375 --> 1:01:12.169
[Kim]

1:01:10.375 --> 1:01:12.169
DID EVERYTHING GO OK?

1:01:12.169 --> 1:01:14.129
YEAH,

1:01:12.169 --> 1:01:14.129
EVERYTHING'S JUST FINE.

1:01:18.008 --> 1:01:21.678
-[sighs]

1:01:18.008 --> 1:01:21.678
-WHAT'S THAT FACE FOR?

1:01:21.678 --> 1:01:24.264
SINCE WHEN DOES HE LIKE YOU

1:01:21.678 --> 1:01:24.264
BETTER THAN HE LIKES ME?

1:01:24.264 --> 1:01:26.308
NO, DON'T EVEN TRIP.

1:01:24.264 --> 1:01:26.308
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

1:01:26.308 --> 1:01:28.101
I'VE JUST BEEN SPENDING

1:01:26.308 --> 1:01:28.101
MORE TIME WITH HIM,

1:01:28.101 --> 1:01:29.311
SO HE WANTED ME.

1:01:29.311 --> 1:01:31.647
HE'S GETTING

1:01:29.311 --> 1:01:31.647
SO MUCH MORE CONFIDENT.

1:01:31.647 --> 1:01:34.274
REMEMBER IN THE BEGINNING,

1:01:31.647 --> 1:01:34.274
HOW HE WOULDN'T PLAY

1:01:31.647 --> 1:01:34.274
WITH ANYBODY ELSE?

1:01:34.274 --> 1:01:37.402
NOW, HE'S EVEN PLAYING WITH

1:01:34.274 --> 1:01:37.402
THAT KID, CRISPIN.

1:01:37.402 --> 1:01:39.863
WITH CRISPIN, WHO BY THE WAY

1:01:37.402 --> 1:01:39.863
HAPPENED TO SAY "THANK YOU"

1:01:39.863 --> 1:01:41.490
AT LUNCH TODAY

1:01:39.863 --> 1:01:41.490
WITHOUT BEING TOLD.

1:01:41.490 --> 1:01:43.325
AND THAT LITTLE GIRL BECCA,

1:01:41.490 --> 1:01:43.325
SHE CAN READ.

1:01:43.325 --> 1:01:44.451
SHE'S JUST A BABY.

1:01:44.451 --> 1:01:45.952
I SEEN HER PICK UP

1:01:44.451 --> 1:01:45.952
A  CURIOUS GEORGE  BOOK,

1:01:45.952 --> 1:01:48.705
AND SIT DOWN AND START

1:01:45.952 --> 1:01:48.705
READING THIS BOOK

1:01:45.952 --> 1:01:48.705
LIKE A GROWNUP.

1:01:48.705 --> 1:01:50.207
WHAT'S THAT FACE?

1:01:52.042 --> 1:01:53.960
YOU KNOW, I HAVEN'T

1:01:52.042 --> 1:01:53.960
SEEN YOU THIS EXCITED

1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:55.712
ABOUT SOMETHING

1:01:53.960 --> 1:01:55.712
IN A LONG TIME.

1:01:57.631 --> 1:01:59.841
YEAH, I AIN'T

1:01:57.631 --> 1:01:59.841
GOING TO FRONT.

1:01:59.841 --> 1:02:02.636
THEM LITTLE CRUMB SNATCHERS

1:01:59.841 --> 1:02:02.636
GOT UNDER MY SKIN.

1:02:02.636 --> 1:02:07.432
MRS. PLAGER, I CANNOT CONTINUE

1:02:02.636 --> 1:02:07.432
TO EXPOSE THE OTHER CHILDREN

1:02:07.432 --> 1:02:09.476
TO SUCH DANGEROUS,

1:02:07.432 --> 1:02:09.476
SELF-DESTRUCTIVE,

1:02:09.476 --> 1:02:11.019
HIGHLY ADDICTIVE BEHAVIOR.

1:02:11.019 --> 1:02:13.355
SO EITHER JULIETTE

1:02:11.019 --> 1:02:13.355
STOPS THE THUMB SUCKING,

1:02:13.355 --> 1:02:17.150
OR YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO

1:02:13.355 --> 1:02:17.150
FIND YOURSELF ANOTHER PRESCHOOL.

1:02:22.780 --> 1:02:24.741
UM, ARE YOU BUSY?

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:26.660
JUST PRUNING A FEW WEEDS

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:26.660
FROM THE GARDEN.

1:02:26.660 --> 1:02:28.912
WHAT IS IT?

1:02:28.912 --> 1:02:32.332
OK, I JUST THOUGHT

1:02:28.912 --> 1:02:32.332
YOU SHOULD KNOW

1:02:32.332 --> 1:02:34.710
WE'VE LOST THREE MORE STUDENTS.

1:02:34.710 --> 1:02:37.795
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY SUGGESTING

1:02:34.710 --> 1:02:37.795
YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?

1:02:37.795 --> 1:02:39.214
NO, MA'AM.

1:02:39.214 --> 1:02:41.132
I KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

1:02:41.132 --> 1:02:42.593
SO DO I.

1:02:45.470 --> 1:02:47.598
DADDY DAY CARE.

1:02:47.598 --> 1:02:50.016
FIRST, IT WAS AMUSING.

1:02:50.016 --> 1:02:52.519
THEN IT WAS ANNOYING.

1:02:52.519 --> 1:02:56.440
NOW IT'S REALLY

1:02:52.519 --> 1:02:56.440
STARTING TO TICK ME OFF.

BUT IT'S STILL THREE ADULTS,

1:04:32.494 --> 1:04:35.372
SO WE'RE STILL UNDER

1:04:32.494 --> 1:04:35.372

1:17:38.112 --> 1:17:40.114
BEFORE DADDY DAY CARE,

1:17:40.114 --> 1:17:42.283
AND THEY'LL BE FINE

1:17:40.114 --> 1:17:42.283
WHEN IT'S OVER.

1:17:42.283 --> 1:17:45.202
YOU TELL YOURSELF

1:17:42.283 --> 1:17:45.202
THAT, CHARLIE.

1:17:45.202 --> 1:17:47.622
I FINALLY FOUND

1:17:45.202 --> 1:17:47.622
A PLACE WHERE I FIT IN,

1:17:47.622 --> 1:17:49.624
WHERE I FEEL LIKE

1:17:47.622 --> 1:17:49.624
I'M DOING SOMETHING GOOD,

1:17:49.624 --> 1:17:51.125
AND YOU GUYS JUST...

1:17:51.125 --> 1:17:52.876
YOU JUST SPOIL IT ALL.

1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:01.844
WELL, THAT COULDN'T

1:17:59.800 --> 1:18:01.844
HAVE GONE WORSE.

1:18:01.844 --> 1:18:05.389
IF YOU THINK THAT WENT BAD,

1:18:01.844 --> 1:18:05.389
WAIT TILL WE TELL THE KIDS.

1:18:05.389 --> 1:18:08.643
[chattering]

1:18:12.563 --> 1:18:14.190
[children laughing]

1:18:21.197 --> 1:18:22.906
CAN I GO TO WORK WITH YOU?

1:18:22.906 --> 1:18:24.700
OH, NO, YOU CAN'T GO

1:18:22.906 --> 1:18:24.700
TO WORK WITH ME,

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:26.619
BUT YOU CAN COME

1:18:24.700 --> 1:18:26.619
VISIT ME AT WORK.

1:18:26.619 --> 1:18:28.996
AND DADDY'S GONNA BE HOME

1:18:26.619 --> 1:18:28.996
AT NIGHT AND ON THE WEEKENDS.

1:18:28.996 --> 1:18:31.081
YOU KNOW, WE CAN STILL HAVE

1:18:28.996 --> 1:18:31.081
LOTS OF FUN TOGETHER.

1:18:31.081 --> 1:18:34.335
WILL PHIL AND MARVIN

1:18:31.081 --> 1:18:34.335

1:18:34.335 --> 1:18:35.794
NO, I'M SORRY,

1:18:34.335 --> 1:18:35.794
LITTLE MAN.

1:18:35.794 --> 1:18:37.463
THEY'RE NOT GOING

1:18:35.794 --> 1:18:37.463
TO BE AROUND ANYMORE.

1:18:38.506 --> 1:18:41.050
IT'S JUST FOR A WHILE, RIGHT?

1:18:41.050 --> 1:18:44.970
THEN YOU'RE GOING TO COME BACK

1:18:41.050 --> 1:18:44.970
AND DO DADDY DAY CARE AGAIN.

1:18:46.430 --> 1:18:48.724
NO, THIS IS--

1:18:46.430 --> 1:18:48.724
THIS IS FROM NOW ON.

1:18:48.724 --> 1:18:51.101
DADDY DAY CARE,

1:18:48.724 --> 1:18:51.101
WE'RE NOT DOING

1:18:48.724 --> 1:18:51.101
THAT ANYMORE, BEN.

1:18:54.230 --> 1:18:56.273
LET ME EXPLAIN IT

1:18:54.230 --> 1:18:56.273
TO YOU LIKE THIS, BEN:

1:18:56.273 --> 1:18:58.150
IF DADDY DOES THIS, RIGHT,

1:18:58.150 --> 1:18:59.776
I CAN GET MONEY FOR US.

1:18:59.776 --> 1:19:01.820
AND I CAN USE THAT MONEY

1:18:59.776 --> 1:19:01.820
TO TAKE CARE OF THE HOUSE

1:19:01.820 --> 1:19:04.781
AND TO BUY FOOD

1:19:01.820 --> 1:19:04.781
AND CLOTHES

1:19:04.781 --> 1:19:06.325
AND TOYS FOR YOU

1:19:04.781 --> 1:19:06.325

1:19:06.325 --> 1:19:09.245
I'LL SELL ALL MY TOYS.

1:19:09.245 --> 1:19:11.747
OH, WHY YOU WANT TO SELL

1:19:09.245 --> 1:19:11.747
ALL YOUR TOYS?

1:19:11.747 --> 1:19:14.958
IF I DON'T HAVE TOYS,

1:19:11.747 --> 1:19:14.958
WE DON'T NEED MONEY,

1:19:14.958 --> 1:19:17.169
AND YOU CAN STAY WITH ME.

1:19:20.297 --> 1:19:22.592
I WISH IT WAS

1:19:20.297 --> 1:19:22.592
THAT SIMPLE, BEN.

1:19:25.553 --> 1:19:27.346
[Charlie]

CHARLIE IS ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

1:19:59.670 --> 1:20:02.381
YOU CAN'T IGNORE THE REALITY.

1:20:02.381 --> 1:20:03.966
PARENTS ARE NOT

1:20:02.381 --> 1:20:03.966

ON THE FLOOR

1:20:11.014 --> 1:20:12.600
TILL BLOOD COMES OUT

1:20:11.014 --> 1:20:12.600
OF THEIR EARS.

1:20:12.600 --> 1:20:13.476
[laughs]

1:20:13.476 --> 1:20:15.352

WHAT'S THE MOST

1:20:42.421 --> 1:20:44.757
IMPORTANT THING?

1:20:56.519 --> 1:20:59.146
IMPORTANT THING. MY KID.

1:20:59.146 --> 1:21:02.941
AND I THINK I'VE MADE

1:20:59.146 --> 1:21:02.941
A TREMENDOUS MISTAKE.

1:21:02.941 --> 1:21:05.902
AND SO, UH, I QUIT.

1:21:08.489 --> 1:21:10.866

1:21:37.142 --> 1:21:40.020
THE CARROT SUIT, WERE YOU?

1:21:40.020 --> 1:21:41.188
THE KIDS LOVE THAT.

1:21:52.366 --> 1:21:53.950
THIS STUFF

1:21:55.077 --> 1:21:58.288
IS NOT FOR SALE!

1:21:58.288 --> 1:22:00.957
A LITERAL READER

1:21:58.288 --> 1:22:00.957
OF THE TEXT MIGHT SAY

1:22:00.957 --> 1:22:04.127
THAT GOLDILOCKS

1:22:00.957 --> 1:22:04.127
ATE THE "PORRIDGE"

1:22:04.127 --> 1:22:07.506
BECAUSE SHE WAS "HUNGRY."

1:22:07.506 --> 1:22:10.259
BUT WHAT WOULD FREUD SAY?

1:22:10.259 --> 1:22:12.177
LANGUAGE SKILLS ARE

1:22:10.259 --> 1:22:12.177
A CRITICAL COMPONENT

1:22:12.177 --> 1:22:14.764
OF CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT.

1:22:14.764 --> 1:22:17.641
THEY'RE PART OF

1:22:14.764 --> 1:22:17.641
THE CORE CURRICULUM HERE

THIS WAY.

1:22:19.976 --> 1:22:22.062
ON THE PATH OF LIFE,

1:22:22.062 --> 1:22:25.608
THE PROPER FIRST STEPS

1:22:22.062 --> 1:22:25.608
ARE ESSENTIAL.

RIGHT HERE AT CHAPMAN.

1:22:32.114 --> 1:22:33.574
OUR PHILOSOPHY

1:22:33.574 --> 1:22:36.368
IS THAT A CHILD IS LIKE

1:22:33.574 --> 1:22:36.368
A CLIMBING VINE.

1:22:36.368 --> 1:22:37.912
WITH STRUCTURE TO CLING TO,

1:22:37.912 --> 1:22:39.747
AND THE RIGHT GARDENER

1:22:37.912 --> 1:22:39.747
TO TEND THEM,

1:22:39.747 --> 1:22:41.457
THEY'LL GROW TO THE SKY.

1:22:41.457 --> 1:22:43.250
THAT'S THE DUMBEST THING

1:22:41.457 --> 1:22:43.250
I EVER HEARD.

1:22:44.627 --> 1:22:45.836
WE'RE NOT TALKING

1:22:44.627 --> 1:22:45.836
ABOUT PLANTS,

1:22:45.836 --> 1:22:47.337
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS.

1:22:47.337 --> 1:22:49.632
I KNOW YOU PEOPLE DON'T WANT

1:22:47.337 --> 1:22:49.632
THIS WOMAN PRUNING

1:22:49.632 --> 1:22:51.383
AND CUTTING AND WEEDING

1:22:49.632 --> 1:22:51.383
YOUR THREE-YEAR-OLDS.

1:22:51.383 --> 1:22:54.052
SOME PEOPLE ARE UNCOMFORTABLE

1:22:51.383 --> 1:22:54.052
WITH ACHIEVEMENT.

1:22:54.052 --> 1:22:56.179
NO, WHAT

1:22:54.052 --> 1:22:56.179
I'M UNCOMFORTABLE WITH

1:22:56.179 --> 1:22:58.933
IS TREATING A LITTLE KID

1:22:56.179 --> 1:22:58.933
LIKE IT'S AN ADULT.

1:22:58.933 --> 1:23:00.643
IF YOU PEOPLE

1:22:58.933 --> 1:23:00.643
LET YOUR KIDS COME HERE,

1:23:00.643 --> 1:23:02.686
THEY'RE GONNA BE MISERABLE

1:23:00.643 --> 1:23:02.686
IN FOUR DIFFERENT LANGUAGES.

1:23:02.686 --> 1:23:03.729
FIVE.

1:23:03.729 --> 1:23:05.397
WE START PORTUGUESE

1:23:03.729 --> 1:23:05.397
IN THE FALL.

1:23:05.397 --> 1:23:07.399
[laughs]

1:23:07.399 --> 1:23:09.485
HOW MANY LANGUAGES

1:23:07.399 --> 1:23:09.485
DO YOU LISTEN TO THEM IN?

1:23:09.485 --> 1:23:11.862
YOU EVER JUST TAKE

1:23:09.485 --> 1:23:11.862
A BREAK AND STOP TRYING

1:23:09.485 --> 1:23:11.862
TO SHOVE KNOWLEDGE

1:23:11.862 --> 1:23:13.530
DOWN THEIR THROAT

1:23:11.862 --> 1:23:13.530
AND JUST TALK TO THEM?

1:23:13.530 --> 1:23:15.115
LISTEN TO 'EM AND SEE

1:23:13.530 --> 1:23:15.115
WHAT THEY WANT.

1:23:15.115 --> 1:23:16.116
THEY'RE CHILDREN,

1:23:16.116 --> 1:23:17.493
THEY DON'T KNOW

1:23:16.116 --> 1:23:17.493
WHAT THEY WANT.

1:23:17.493 --> 1:23:19.202
YES, THEY DO KNOW

1:23:17.493 --> 1:23:19.202
WHAT THEY WANT.

1:23:19.202 --> 1:23:21.288
ALL OF THEM.

1:23:19.202 --> 1:23:21.288
AND THEY'RE ALL DIFFERENT.

1:23:21.288 --> 1:23:23.165
WE TOOK SOME TIME,

1:23:21.288 --> 1:23:23.165
WE TALKED TO THE KIDS,

1:23:23.165 --> 1:23:24.458
GOT TO KNOW THEM A LITTLE BIT.

1:23:24.458 --> 1:23:25.793
AND IT MADE A DIFFERENCE.

1:23:24.458 --> 1:23:25.793
IT HELPED THEM.

1:23:25.793 --> 1:23:28.545
OH, PLEASE.

1:23:25.793 --> 1:23:28.545
SHARE YOUR SUCCESS.

1:23:28.545 --> 1:23:30.297
WHY DON'T YOU TELL
