00:17.934 --> 00:19.269
[thunder crashing]

00:29.738 --> 00:31.448
[woman] I'm really worried about him.

00:31.531 --> 00:34.367
[man] Me too.
I've never seen him this upset.

00:34.451 --> 00:36.202
-[woman] I know.
-[man] He's taking it hard.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.415
[woman] You know what he said to me?

00:40.498 --> 00:43.334
He said he'll never write
another story ever again.

00:43.418 --> 00:45.003
-[man] He said that?
-[woman] Yeah.

00:45.086 --> 00:46.796
[screaming]

00:47.756 --> 00:50.717
[crying] This is lame! Stupid!

00:51.843 --> 00:53.261

00:57.557 --> 00:59.309
[crying]

00:59.392 --> 01:01.394
I'm gonna burn all this stupid stuff!

01:01.978 --> 01:03.438
[breathing shakily]

01:05.565 --> 01:07.692
[crying]

01:10.695 --> 01:13.948
[woman] I'm so afraid that tonight
is gonna, like, stifle him

01:14.032 --> 01:15.950
or be this wound that haunts him.

01:16.659 --> 01:17.619
Poor little guy.

01:17.702 --> 01:19.037
[man] He's a creative kid,

01:19.120 --> 01:21.748
but maybe we let his obsession
with horror get out of hand.

01:21.831 --> 01:22.665
[woman sighs]

01:22.749 --> 01:26.086
[man] I guess I can see
how they could consider it a little weird.

01:26.169 --> 01:30.298
Maybe it would be easier
if he was just more, I don't know, normal.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.471
[woman] I think I heard something.

01:36.554 --> 01:37.597
[man sighs]

01:39.432 --> 01:40.433
Alex?

01:40.517 --> 01:41.893
I didn't hear anything.

It was all gonna be so perfect, Lucy…

02:25.770 --> 02:28.106
[distant screams on TV]

02:28.189 --> 02:30.900
[man 1 on TV]
…just like one big, happy family.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.654
Your boys

02:36.447 --> 02:37.574
and my boys.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.451
[boy on TV]
Great. The bloodsucking Brady Bunch.

02:40.535 --> 02:41.911
[Alex] Lost Boys?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.413
I still want you, Lucy.

02:43.496 --> 02:44.455
[screaming]

02:45.456 --> 02:47.750
[man 1 on TV]
I haven't changed my mind about that.

02:48.501 --> 02:50.712
[man 2 on TV]
I didn't invite you this time, Max.

02:50.795 --> 02:51.713
[Lucy] Michael.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.717
Michael, no!

-Hello?

04:02.116 --> 04:03.451
[door rattles]

04:13.586 --> 04:14.504
Hello?

04:14.587 --> 04:15.713
Anyone?

04:15.797 --> 04:17.006
I'm trapped!

04:17.507 --> 04:18.341
Mom!

04:18.967 --> 04:20.009

-[electricity buzzes]

04:41.906 --> 04:44.993
[woman] What is your name?

04:45.868 --> 04:46.995
A… Alex.

04:48.246 --> 04:50.039
Alex Mosher.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.166

05:06.306 --> 05:07.724
[inhales deeply]

05:18.276 --> 05:21.362
[gasps, yelps] Please, please.

05:21.863 --> 05:23.156
[whimpering]

05:26.409 --> 05:27.243
[whispers] Boo.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.494
[breathes shakily, gulps]

05:28.578 --> 05:30.496
Let's get this over with.
I'm a busy witch.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.123
Are you useful in any way?

05:32.206 --> 05:33.458
Uh, I… [grunts]

05:33.541 --> 05:34.625
[breathes shakily]

05:35.501 --> 05:36.461
Do you see them?

05:36.544 --> 05:39.339
The apartment lured them in.

05:40.923 --> 05:42.425
That's what the apartment does.

05:44.802 --> 05:45.887
Those children,

05:46.929 --> 05:48.598
they were not useful to me.

05:49.932 --> 05:51.309
Do you understand?

05:51.392 --> 05:52.894
So let's try this again.

05:52.977 --> 05:57.732
Is there anything special
about you at all?

05:57.815 --> 05:59.984
Any reason I should let you live?

06:01.819 --> 06:03.696
-And get up.
-[whooshing]

06:04.489 --> 06:05.448
[witch] Come closer.

06:05.531 --> 06:09.869
[eerie whooshing and creaking]

06:10.536 --> 06:12.580
Goodbye, Alex.

06:14.665 --> 06:16.542
[witch chuckles]

06:16.626 --> 06:20.588
[hesitates] I do write scary stories.

06:22.757 --> 06:23.674
[Alex grunts]

06:25.885 --> 06:29.806
Did you say "scary stories"?

06:29.889 --> 06:31.891
-[growling and rumbling]
-[Alex gasps]

06:31.974 --> 06:33.309
What's… what's that?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.853
[growling and rumbling subside]

06:35.937 --> 06:36.854
No more questions.

06:38.064 --> 06:41.109
My Nightbooks.
It's where I wrote my stories.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.029
What are you doing with these
so late at night?

06:45.113 --> 06:46.155
I was…

06:47.407 --> 06:49.992
I was gonna burn them
in the boiler room downstairs.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.537
Burn them? So they're not any good.

06:52.620 --> 06:54.038
-No.
-Goodbye, Alex.

06:54.122 --> 06:56.374
They're good.
They're very, really, really good.

06:56.457 --> 06:57.291
[breathes shakily]

06:57.959 --> 06:59.210
Nightbooks, huh?

07:00.753 --> 07:03.381
The title better not be
the scariest thing about them.

07:03.464 --> 07:06.551
I'm going to need a story every night.

07:06.634 --> 07:10.596
The story better be good,
and it better be scary,

07:11.431 --> 07:14.100
or it's the last thing
you'll ever do. [giggles]

Mischievous little thing.

[Alex] What is this place?

09:40.746 --> 09:41.872
Where's the TV?

09:42.582 --> 09:44.584
[menacing music playing]

09:51.048 --> 09:53.259
[Alex] And where'd the front door go?

What?

10:45.519 --> 10:47.772
-[Alex] You're a kid.
-[girl] And you're a genius.

10:49.106 --> 10:50.650
I'm Alex. Who are you?

10:50.733 --> 10:53.069
[sighs] You're gonna be chatty. Great.

10:53.694 --> 10:54.695
I'm Yasmin.

10:56.530 --> 10:58.074
Are you a prisoner too?

10:58.574 --> 11:00.159
No, I'm on vacation.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.869
Okay, food's here.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.246
Hope you like peanut butter.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.539
I used to.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.876
Anything in these cabinets is off-limits.

11:08.959 --> 11:12.088
Don't ever think
Natacha won't miss this piece of popcorn.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.256
-Lenore tells her everything.
-[Lenore growls]

11:14.340 --> 11:15.925
Come out, you evil skin-bag.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.343
-[Lenore hisses]
-[gasps]

11:17.426 --> 11:19.929
-[Lenore growls]
-[Yasmin sighs]

11:20.680 --> 11:22.431
[Alex] And that's the invisible cat?

11:22.515 --> 11:25.643
You say cat.
I say Natacha's little spy-beast.

11:27.019 --> 11:28.270
And Natacha is…

11:29.438 --> 11:32.108
Keep up. Natacha is the witch.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.611
Lenore is that wrinkled, hairless thing
that follows you around all day,

11:35.695 --> 11:37.363
popping up out of nowhere.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.949
She ratted me out
over a stinking cup of noodles.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.075
I hate that cat.

11:43.494 --> 11:46.706
Don't just stand there. Help me
clean this up before Natacha gets home.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.751
Where is she, Natacha?

11:50.835 --> 11:52.878
I don't know where she goes
or what she does,

11:52.962 --> 11:54.547
but she can go anywhere she wants.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.842
Talk about the ultimate passport,
this apartment is it.

11:57.925 --> 12:00.803
Come on. We both have work to do.
I'll get you set up.

12:00.886 --> 12:02.513
Ultimate passport?

12:02.596 --> 12:05.641
The apartment travels
all over the world, luring kids in.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.144
I'm from New York. Brooklyn.

12:08.227 --> 12:11.313
I live in Washington. Washington, DC.

12:12.273 --> 12:14.650
Or I did before.

12:16.444 --> 12:18.279
I wonder if we're still in Brooklyn.

12:18.362 --> 12:19.780
The apartment moves?

12:20.364 --> 12:21.866
When it needs fresh meat.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.120
Not literally. Jeez.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.790
Thought you wrote scary stories.

12:31.876 --> 12:32.710
Not anymore.

12:36.297 --> 12:37.757
[door creaks]

12:38.758 --> 12:39.633
Ta-da.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.719
[ethereal music playing]

12:49.143 --> 12:50.269
Whoa!

12:52.646 --> 12:54.398
This is so cool.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.067
[echoing] How is…

12:57.151 --> 12:58.986
I mean, wow!

13:00.154 --> 13:01.155
It can't be.

13:04.158 --> 13:04.992
Hello!

13:09.330 --> 13:10.873
How is this even possible?

13:12.124 --> 13:14.043
The apartment can do two things.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.172
It lures suckers like us in,

13:19.632 --> 13:21.091
and it has room to hold…

13:22.051 --> 13:23.719
This is so cool.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.305
…well, anything.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.974
The Empty Classroom
and Other Creepy Stories.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.227
Nightdreams and Daymares.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.521
Whispered Tales.

13:34.063 --> 13:35.731
She does like stories.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.777
I thought you said
you weren't into that kinda stuff anymore.

13:40.361 --> 13:43.697
-I'm not. It's my friend.
-Oh, it's your friend?

13:43.781 --> 13:46.408
He, uh… he'd like all this stuff.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.078
But me? Nah.

13:49.161 --> 13:51.705
-He's, like… he's really lame.
-Yeah, he sounds lame.

13:52.998 --> 13:54.375
Hmm. Cool. Okay, yeah.

13:54.458 --> 13:58.671
So she makes me read her
a stupid scary story every night,

13:58.754 --> 14:01.465
but she says
everything in here's already been read.

14:04.635 --> 14:05.469
Everything?

14:07.930 --> 14:09.849
Good thing you're a storyteller.

14:11.058 --> 14:13.227
She needs you, so get to work.

14:13.811 --> 14:16.397
You heard her.
She wants a scary story tonight.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.191
Every day,
write as many stories as you can.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.192
I don't write--

14:20.276 --> 14:21.360
Cut the crap.

14:21.443 --> 14:24.613
I heard you last night,
talking about your Nightbook thingies.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.490
Oh, those.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.285
I'm over the whole writing thing.

14:29.368 --> 14:32.496
Then you better get over getting over it
and crank out some new tales,

14:32.580 --> 14:33.706
'cause if you don't--

14:33.789 --> 14:35.583
She'll kill me. I know.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.168
You'll be lucky if she kills you.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.212
This is your life now.

14:40.713 --> 14:45.718
Forget your family. Forget your friends.
Focus on being useful to Natacha.

14:45.801 --> 14:46.802
You wanna live?

14:48.095 --> 14:49.805
Write scary stories.

14:50.472 --> 14:51.390
[sighs]

14:53.434 --> 14:55.227
I'm not gonna write anything,

14:55.769 --> 14:57.354
'cause I'm getting out of here.

14:57.438 --> 14:58.647
[Yasmin] You're gonna die.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.108
-[door slams shut]
-[sighs]

15:01.191 --> 15:05.279
-[rain pattering]
-[thunder rumbling]

15:05.362 --> 15:07.907
[Alex] Come on, open.

15:08.407 --> 15:09.450
Where are you?

15:10.159 --> 15:11.660
[door rattling]

15:28.969 --> 15:29.929
Another exit.

16:03.671 --> 16:04.797
[Alex panting]

16:06.715 --> 16:10.344
-[electrical crackling]
-[Alex grunts, groans]

16:11.637 --> 16:12.554
Damn.

16:14.056 --> 16:15.265
Every time.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.769
You all try and run.

16:18.852 --> 16:20.396
There's no escape.

16:21.647 --> 16:22.773
You understand?

16:22.856 --> 16:23.691
[Alex grunts]

16:24.942 --> 16:26.652
[distorted] You understand?

16:29.822 --> 16:31.407
[Natacha's footsteps recede]

16:32.032 --> 16:33.659
[Alex sighs]

16:39.415 --> 16:41.542
[purring]

16:43.210 --> 16:48.215
Hmm. Were you purposely making me wait?

16:50.092 --> 16:52.803
-No. I… I was doing the dishes.
-Sit there.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.060
[chair scraping]

17:00.144 --> 17:01.311
[Lenore meows]

17:05.941 --> 17:09.111
-Should I just start reading?
-[Lenore purring]

17:10.404 --> 17:11.572
[Alex sighs]

17:12.531 --> 17:13.866
[exhales deeply]

17:15.659 --> 17:16.660
[inhales deeply]

17:16.744 --> 17:19.705
[dramatic music playing]

17:19.788 --> 17:21.874
Give me a minute to get settled.

17:21.957 --> 17:23.208
I mean, honestly!

17:23.292 --> 17:25.627
[breathes deeply]

17:31.050 --> 17:31.967
What is that?

17:32.051 --> 17:36.430
Do you know what happens to children
who ask too many questions?

17:38.640 --> 17:40.267
Do you wanna find out?

17:41.560 --> 17:45.731
-[spraying]
-[inhaling deeply]

17:49.651 --> 17:51.987
So, Storyteller,

17:52.738 --> 17:56.200
you tried to escape today.

17:57.618 --> 18:01.789
Yasmin, too,
had a little rebellious streak.

18:02.372 --> 18:05.876
But I am curious about one thing.

18:06.418 --> 18:11.548
Why burn your stories?

18:11.632 --> 18:14.134
[growling and rumbling]

18:14.218 --> 18:15.219
[Lenore meows]

18:17.888 --> 18:19.389
What is that?

18:20.516 --> 18:22.101
Read. Now.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.021
-[growling and rumbling subside]
-[meows]

18:29.858 --> 18:32.111
[Alex] "When…
when Todd's best friend Jenny died,

18:32.194 --> 18:34.530
his heart shattered
into a thousand pieces."

18:34.613 --> 18:36.865
Shattered heart? I like it already.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.202
[dramatic music playing]

18:44.123 --> 18:46.875
[Alex] "Everyone avoided
the Foster Playground at night."

18:46.959 --> 18:48.293
"They all knew the legend."

18:48.377 --> 18:51.797
"In the hour before daylight,
the dead kids would come out and play."

18:51.880 --> 18:54.299
Nope. No, no, no. Sorry, nope.

18:54.383 --> 18:58.220
Everyone knows that ghosts haunt places
that are personal to them,

18:58.303 --> 19:00.180
not public places.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.266
Uh, are… are you sure?

19:03.725 --> 19:05.185
I'm sure.

19:05.269 --> 19:06.353
[thunder crashes]

19:07.146 --> 19:08.313
Get on with it.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.776
[Alex] "Todd walks to the playground.
He gets to the gate."

19:13.485 --> 19:16.238
"And as soon as his foot
crosses the threshold,

19:17.072 --> 19:18.240
children…"

19:18.782 --> 19:22.161
-[Todd gasping]
-[Alex] "…squealing, playing."

19:24.413 --> 19:27.374
"Suddenly, a boy shoots out of the slide."

19:27.457 --> 19:31.420
"Maybe he's ten or so,
dressed like a newsie from the '20s."

19:31.503 --> 19:33.338
Rude. You could at least say hi.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.298
Hey… hey.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.091
I… I mean… I mean hi.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.094
I'm looking for my friend, Jenny.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.805
[Alex] "…Todd says,
while looking for any sign of her."

19:43.182 --> 19:45.350
To find her, you have to play.

19:45.434 --> 19:49.188
[Alex] "The newsie whistles,
and half a dozen dead kids surround Todd."

19:49.271 --> 19:53.692
"Their skin is deathly white.
Some of their clothes date back decades."

19:53.775 --> 19:56.278
"They push Todd on a swing,
higher and higher--"

19:56.361 --> 19:57.446
[Natacha] Stupid!

19:57.529 --> 20:01.491
Everyone knows
ghosts don't have actual physical hands,

20:01.575 --> 20:04.328
so they could never push him on a swing.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.412
Amateur.

20:05.996 --> 20:06.997
[Alex sighs]

20:09.124 --> 20:11.960
The playground is…
it's an interdimensional plane,

20:12.044 --> 20:14.421
a mix between
the spirit world and the real world.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.299
Oh, so you're a quantum physicist now?

20:20.260 --> 20:22.638
-Whatever. Continue.
-[Lenore meows]

20:25.766 --> 20:27.976
[hesitates] "And then the children laugh,

20:28.060 --> 20:30.479
and they pull Todd
to a rusty merry-go-round."

20:30.562 --> 20:34.024
"They spin him around and around,
faster and faster,

20:34.107 --> 20:35.776
making Todd dizzier and dizzier."

20:35.859 --> 20:38.320
"Then the ghosts force Todd
onto a seesaw."

20:38.403 --> 20:39.571
"He holds on tight."

20:39.655 --> 20:41.823
"Suddenly, Todd realizes
what they're up to."

20:41.907 --> 20:45.327
"Any living child still on the playground
when the sun rises

20:45.410 --> 20:48.247
is cursed to remain there forever."

20:48.330 --> 20:51.166
"He stumbles towards the gate,
desperate to get out,

20:51.250 --> 20:54.378
but his world is spinning,
and he's tripping over his own feet."

20:54.461 --> 20:57.172
"The sun's almost up.
He's nearly out of time."

20:57.256 --> 20:59.716
"All the ghost children
watch in suspense."

21:00.384 --> 21:02.010
"Todd's not going to make it."

21:02.094 --> 21:05.180
"Until suddenly, someone grabs him
and pulls him towards the exit."

21:05.264 --> 21:06.390
"It's Jenny!"

21:07.724 --> 21:10.018
"'Jenny, I… I wanted to see you.'"

21:10.102 --> 21:11.853
"'Get out of here,' Jenny says,

21:11.937 --> 21:13.855
not stopping for a happy reunion."

21:17.150 --> 21:19.903
"Seeing his old friend again
makes Todd's heart hurt."

21:19.987 --> 21:22.572
I miss you. I don't wanna let you go.

21:22.656 --> 21:23.782
[Alex] "But in death,

21:23.865 --> 21:26.785
Jenny discovered something
that Todd is about to learn."

21:26.868 --> 21:28.662
Friends never let go, Todd.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.040
[Alex] "Because friends never forget."

21:33.000 --> 21:34.835
[Jenny] I'll always be with you,

21:35.669 --> 21:36.586
here.

21:37.129 --> 21:38.922
[dramatic music playing]

21:53.729 --> 21:56.815
[growling and rumbling]

21:56.898 --> 21:58.442
A happy ending?

21:59.860 --> 22:02.863
-[meows]
-[distorted] Are you out of your mind?

22:02.946 --> 22:04.740
No happy endings, you fool.

22:08.118 --> 22:11.496
Jenny… Jenny's dead. She's… she's trapped
on the playground forever.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.999
-It's not happy for her.
-[Natacha breathing heavily]

22:14.624 --> 22:17.294
[spluttering]
Ghostly hands go on Todd's back.

22:17.377 --> 22:19.671
He… he… he glances behind him,

22:19.755 --> 22:22.007
and he's pulled into the playground.

22:22.090 --> 22:24.676
He… he screams for help, but it's no use.

22:24.760 --> 22:27.846
His ghostly soul is trapped there
to this very day.

22:28.347 --> 22:29.473
[thunder crashing]

22:29.556 --> 22:31.558
[grunting]

22:34.770 --> 22:37.522
-[grunts, pants]
-[growling and rumbling subside]

22:37.606 --> 22:38.815
[sighs]

22:43.070 --> 22:46.239
[breathlessly]
Happy endings are a dangerous thing.

22:47.157 --> 22:48.283
Never forget that.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.493
[shudders]

22:49.576 --> 22:53.163
Did you at least like the story?
I mean, until the ending?

22:53.246 --> 22:57.084
[sighs] Writers, always so insecure.

22:57.167 --> 22:59.503
You're still alive, aren't you?

23:11.264 --> 23:14.226
I'm mystified by you, Storyteller.

23:15.560 --> 23:21.400
This beautiful darkness
dances inside your brain.

23:22.025 --> 23:23.693
You should celebrate it.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.071
But you run from it.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.406
Why?

23:29.658 --> 23:30.742
I just…

23:32.869 --> 23:35.122
[sighs] I… I wanna be like everyone else.

23:38.959 --> 23:40.544
You wrote all this today?

23:40.627 --> 23:43.922
Uh, I had… I had trouble writing today.

23:44.506 --> 23:45.507
What?

23:45.590 --> 23:49.428
It's just hard to concentrate
with someone staring at me all day.

23:52.973 --> 23:57.102
I told you, show him the library
and then get out.

23:57.185 --> 23:58.061
Wait! Wait!

23:58.145 --> 23:59.563
[breathing shakily]

24:00.230 --> 24:01.481
Not her! Not her.

24:03.650 --> 24:05.402
You were disturbing him.

24:05.485 --> 24:09.322
-[meows]
-It is very important that he writes.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.992
You know how important it is.

24:13.160 --> 24:14.411
Wait!

24:17.456 --> 24:19.291
It… it wasn't her fault either.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.586
[meows meekly]

24:23.378 --> 24:27.048
Well, if it wasn't Yasmin's fault,
and it wasn't Lenore's fault,

24:27.132 --> 24:30.302
then whose fault was it?

24:31.761 --> 24:35.098
Mine. I'll… I'll write faster.

24:36.766 --> 24:39.102
[Natacha] Lenore won't bother you again.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.605
No more excuses, Storyteller.

24:41.688 --> 24:43.148
[meows]

24:45.358 --> 24:46.359
[sighs]

24:50.947 --> 24:52.866
[sighs] Are you okay?

24:54.367 --> 24:55.535
Leave me alone.

24:55.619 --> 24:58.705
[splutters] Yasmin, I'm sorry.

24:58.788 --> 25:01.333
I wasn't trying to get you
in any kind of trouble.

25:01.416 --> 25:05.378
Yasmin, I'm sorry. I didn't know
about the "no happy endings" thing.

25:07.589 --> 25:09.674
Todd shouldn't have gone back for Jenny.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.970
-He was stupid.
-No, he wasn't.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.306
He was her friend,
and that's what friends do.

25:16.806 --> 25:18.517
Maybe in fairy tales.

25:18.600 --> 25:21.269
But in here? She's right, you know.

25:22.479 --> 25:24.189
Happy endings don't exist.

25:31.738 --> 25:33.949
[clinking]

25:39.955 --> 25:40.872
[sighs]

25:41.581 --> 25:42.874
[squishing]

25:44.084 --> 25:44.918
What?

25:45.418 --> 25:46.836
What… what is that?

25:53.051 --> 25:54.219
[farting and splashing]

25:54.302 --> 25:56.972
[breathing heavily]

26:00.725 --> 26:01.560
[purring]

26:03.562 --> 26:04.563
[meows]

26:06.356 --> 26:07.649
This place sucks.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.487
[Alex sighs]

26:13.154 --> 26:16.491
She wants stories?
Fine. I'll give her some stories.

26:16.575 --> 26:17.951
[groans]

26:27.419 --> 26:29.588
Yes! Yes, a haunted desk!

26:29.671 --> 26:32.757
Haunted by the spirit
of somebody who died working at it.

26:32.841 --> 26:35.468
No, no, it's stupid.
They're gonna think it's stupid.

26:35.552 --> 26:37.220
How long you been here for?

26:37.721 --> 26:38.972
Looks like a while.

26:39.681 --> 26:40.974
How'd they get you?

26:41.057 --> 26:43.893
They got me
with a piece of pie and Lost Boys.

26:46.354 --> 26:47.480
[grunts in frustration]

26:49.566 --> 26:50.650
[sighs]

26:51.568 --> 26:53.028
Once upon a time,

26:53.570 --> 26:55.780
Alex stared up at the ceiling.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.742
Then the ceiling fell on him

26:59.909 --> 27:01.828
and put him out of his misery.

27:02.454 --> 27:03.330
The end.

27:09.586 --> 27:10.629
What's up there?

27:12.213 --> 27:13.840
[panting]

27:32.317 --> 27:33.318
[sighs]

27:46.498 --> 27:48.208
It's the oldest book in here.

27:48.958 --> 27:51.544
This thing's gotta be,
like, a thousand years old.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.095
"Kinder und Hausmärchen."

28:06.184 --> 28:07.352
"Rumpelstiltskin."

28:11.981 --> 28:13.566
"Sleeping Beauty"?

28:15.318 --> 28:16.277
Wow!

28:20.115 --> 28:21.449
"Hansel and Gretel."

28:23.868 --> 28:25.745
Is that a ballpoint pen?

28:25.829 --> 28:27.455
[ominous music playing]

29:00.029 --> 29:01.531
Wow. "Frankenstein."

29:10.248 --> 29:11.416
Oh my God.

29:13.501 --> 29:14.335
It's writing.

29:17.380 --> 29:21.009
"If I don't make it out of here,
I need someone to know what happened,

29:21.092 --> 29:23.720
even if it's only
the characters in these books."

29:23.803 --> 29:25.221
"I saw a unicorn."

29:25.847 --> 29:28.183
"People said they didn't exist,
but there it was."

29:28.266 --> 29:32.437
"I followed it into this apartment,
and now I'm trapped by a witch."

29:33.021 --> 29:34.564
"She's mean and scary."

29:46.409 --> 29:49.120
"I just have to do
what the witch tells me to

29:49.204 --> 29:51.164
until Mom and Dad find me."

29:51.247 --> 29:54.209
"There are other kids here.
Most of them are nice."

29:54.292 --> 29:57.170
"I'm scared, but at least I'm not alone."

29:57.253 --> 29:58.588
[door thudding]

30:03.343 --> 30:04.511
Dinner in an hour.

30:04.594 --> 30:06.179
Hey, Yasmin,

30:06.805 --> 30:08.139
do you like unicorns?

30:09.390 --> 30:11.518
Yeah, 'cause that's so me.

30:11.601 --> 30:15.230
Oh, I thought maybe
that's how she got you.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.357
Natacha, I mean.

30:18.066 --> 30:20.026
You're right. It's none of my business.

30:20.109 --> 30:24.072
And I bet you weren't lured in
by a stupid movie and a piece of pie.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.115
Stupid pumpkin pie.

30:28.743 --> 30:29.786
Fine.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.288
It was doro wat.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.333
What the hell is doro wat?

30:36.459 --> 30:41.214
Chicken, onions caramelized
in spiced butter, paprika, garlic,

30:41.297 --> 30:43.508
ginger, berbere spice.

30:44.717 --> 30:45.552
My āyatē…

30:46.594 --> 30:49.556
My grandmother and I
used to make it before she died.

30:50.807 --> 30:53.309
We even grew all the herbs
and veggies ourselves.

30:54.727 --> 30:57.146
Anyways, I smelled doro wat,

30:57.230 --> 31:01.442
and I just so badly wanted
to see my āyatē again.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.781
But it wasn't her.

31:08.199 --> 31:09.325
It was a witch,

31:09.409 --> 31:11.911
an evil, wicked witch.

31:14.664 --> 31:16.332
How's that for a happy ending?

31:19.377 --> 31:20.420
[door slams shut]

31:25.925 --> 31:27.218
[Natacha sighs]

31:33.683 --> 31:35.768
[Alex] "With the fangs came the hunger,

31:35.852 --> 31:38.396
and Katie discovered
that her hunch was right."

31:38.479 --> 31:41.482
"To a vampire,
blood does taste like candy."

31:41.566 --> 31:46.738
Everybody knows
it takes two days to grow full fangs.

31:46.821 --> 31:48.239
You're stupid.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.664
[Alex] Here, Lenore, a peace offering.

31:57.165 --> 31:59.626
[meows, hisses]

32:05.715 --> 32:06.966
[mutters] Story.

32:07.050 --> 32:09.010
[sighs in frustration]

32:09.093 --> 32:12.263
There's gotta be more writing
from that Unicorn Girl.

32:12.347 --> 32:15.183
"…but it's too late.
The roller coaster plunges down the drop."

32:15.266 --> 32:18.478
"Steel snaps, metal shrieks,

32:20.355 --> 32:21.689
humans scream,

32:22.649 --> 32:25.818
and the grim reaper's dog laughs
at the carnage."

32:26.569 --> 32:29.739
The grim reaper doesn't have a pet.

32:30.406 --> 32:31.950
Isn't that right, Lenore?

32:44.754 --> 32:45.964
[yells]

32:46.047 --> 32:47.757
This is gonna take forever!

32:51.844 --> 32:56.849
[water pouring]

33:04.607 --> 33:08.277
"They saw their son's footprints
in the snow, leading into the woods."

33:08.361 --> 33:11.280
"Then they saw
a pair of smaller footprints,

33:11.364 --> 33:12.532
teddy-bear-sized."

33:12.615 --> 33:13.491
[Natacha sighs]

33:13.574 --> 33:16.035
"And they never saw
their precious son again."

33:16.536 --> 33:19.372
[Natacha] Possessed teddy bears? Really?

33:19.956 --> 33:21.874
Took me right out of the story.

33:21.958 --> 33:26.045
Every good story hints at truth.

33:26.629 --> 33:29.799
The more truth,
the more powerful the story.

33:30.591 --> 33:34.512
From now on, get your facts straight.

33:36.514 --> 33:38.641
[intense music playing]

33:46.899 --> 33:47.734
Yes!

33:48.234 --> 33:49.861
[breathing heavily]

33:50.820 --> 33:53.281
"I don't know how long I've been here."

33:53.364 --> 33:56.367
"I still have the necklace
Mom and Dad gave me."

33:56.951 --> 33:59.245
"I used to touch it to remember them,

33:59.328 --> 34:00.955
but I stopped."

34:01.039 --> 34:02.665
"It made me cry."

34:03.166 --> 34:04.584
"I'm tired of crying."

34:07.628 --> 34:09.881
"I have what I need to escape tonight."

34:09.964 --> 34:12.675
"I'm finally going to see them again,
Mom and Dad."

34:12.759 --> 34:14.635
"I wonder if they'll even know me."

34:14.719 --> 34:16.596
"Can people forget their kids?"

34:19.015 --> 34:20.391
-"Escape"?
-[Yasmin] Alex?

34:20.475 --> 34:22.852
[yelps, grunts]

34:22.935 --> 34:24.604
Oh my God! [gasps]

34:29.067 --> 34:31.277
You did not just throw a book at me!

34:31.360 --> 34:33.154
Uh, no. You just surprised me.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.238
I dropped it.

34:34.322 --> 34:36.282
Hold on. I'm coming down.

34:38.117 --> 34:41.954
Hey, Yasmin,
wait until you see what I found.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.250
Hey, what's wrong?

34:58.763 --> 35:00.515
This is Natacha's night nursery.

35:00.598 --> 35:01.641
Night nursery?

35:01.724 --> 35:04.352
Yeah. Sunlight is bad for magical plants.

35:04.435 --> 35:05.269
Come on.

35:22.912 --> 35:24.539
What's all this for?

35:25.123 --> 35:27.667
Ingredients mostly, for Natacha's potions.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.423
Don't touch anything.

35:36.634 --> 35:37.844
[squealing]

35:39.053 --> 35:40.012
What's that?

35:40.596 --> 35:41.848
Demon silk.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.058
Enough questions. Help me with this.

35:44.142 --> 35:47.186
I watered the vine with rat's blood
instead of bat's blood.

35:47.270 --> 35:50.690
Now, Shredder eggs are growing on it.
If one of them hatches,

35:50.773 --> 35:53.484
it can destroy the night nursery,
and Natacha will kill me.

35:55.319 --> 35:56.904
-[hisses]
-[Alex and Yasmin gasp]

35:57.488 --> 35:59.949
-[Yasmin] I'm taking care of it, Lenore.

-[crunching]
-[Yasmin gasps softly]

36:22.096 --> 36:26.100
[whispering] Okay.
Put it gently on the ground.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.644
Be careful. Don't jostle it.

36:29.395 --> 36:30.229
Be careful.

36:30.313 --> 36:31.731
[breathes deeply]

36:35.818 --> 36:37.737
Okay, now what?

36:38.863 --> 36:41.449
Stomp it as hard as you can.

36:41.532 --> 36:43.284
-[purring]
-[dramatic music playing]

36:44.285 --> 36:45.786
[crunching and splattering]

36:48.331 --> 36:49.332
Good.

36:55.671 --> 36:58.132
[Alex] Where's the blue mist come from?
Do you make it?

36:58.216 --> 37:00.259
The mist,
do you think it keeps Natacha young?

37:00.343 --> 37:03.054
It's none of our business.

37:03.137 --> 37:06.098
I mean, she's really pretty,
but her books are ancient,

37:06.182 --> 37:08.601
and the apartment looks like
a granny decorated it.

37:10.728 --> 37:13.564
[Yasmin screams, distorted]

37:17.401 --> 37:20.613
[Alex, distorted] No!

37:20.696 --> 37:22.782
[meows, distorted]

[panting]

37:23.950 --> 37:25.243

37:52.979 --> 37:54.105
It's getting away!

[Yasmin and Alex panting]

37:56.774 --> 37:57.858
-No! No!
-No!

37:58.651 --> 38:01.696
It's cutting down the Shredder eggs!
Stomp on them!

38:14.417 --> 38:15.876

38:15.960 --> 38:17.003
Sorry.

38:18.754 --> 38:19.755
[Yasmin gasps]

38:20.840 --> 38:22.675
That's all the Shredder eggs.

38:22.758 --> 38:24.593
[Shredder screeching]

38:24.677 --> 38:27.096
[Yasmin] There it is!
Don't let it get away!

38:27.179 --> 38:30.933
[Alex and Yasmin grunting and panting]

38:32.935 --> 38:34.478
[gasps] Alex, look out!

38:37.481 --> 38:38.316
Thanks, Yas.

38:38.899 --> 38:40.693
[spluttering] I mean, Yasmin.

38:43.070 --> 38:45.239
Wait. Where is it?

[both gasp]

38:54.582 --> 38:55.916

38:56.917 --> 39:00.004
We need to find it and kill it
before it destroys the whole place.

Oh God. [breathing heavily]

40:03.692 --> 40:04.610
[grunts]

40:19.750 --> 40:20.918
[Yasmin] It's gone.

40:21.669 --> 40:23.921
I don't know where it went.

You useless little twits.

42:01.477 --> 42:04.647
You've been misbehaving in my garden.

42:05.773 --> 42:10.653
This will hurt you
far more than it hurts me. [chuckles]

42:10.736 --> 42:13.781
[crying] Please, I… I can explain.

42:13.864 --> 42:16.617
[Natacha] And I would let you

if I cared.

42:18.035 --> 42:19.453
[Yasmin and Alex whimpering]

Do try to keep your eyes open.

42:41.850 --> 42:43.185
It was my fault!

42:44.311 --> 42:46.272
I begged Yasmin to take me to the nursery.

42:46.355 --> 42:50.234

think of something cool to write about.

42:50.317 --> 42:51.527

42:51.610 --> 42:54.780

not to touch anything, but I did.

That is very brave of you, Storyteller,

[cries mockingly]

43:24.560 --> 43:28.355

43:28.439 --> 43:29.857
I almost killed you.

If I didn't need you
to clean up the mess, I would've.

43:35.821 --> 43:37.323
No more chances.

Yas, you okay?

Look,

I'm sorry I got you involved.

From now on,
you help yourself. I'll help myself.

Yas, we can get out of here, together.

45:36.692 --> 45:39.111
-[Shredder screeching]
-[Alex] Here we go. Okay.

45:39.653 --> 45:40.529
One…

45:40.612 --> 45:42.656
[breathing heavily] …two,

45:44.074 --> 45:44.908
three!

45:46.160 --> 45:48.120
[Shredder chittering]

45:48.203 --> 45:50.080
-[screeching]
-[screams]

45:50.706 --> 45:54.084
Get… get off me! Get off me! Get off!

45:55.335 --> 45:57.421
-[screeching]
-[Alex] No! No! No!

45:57.504 --> 46:01.508
-[Alex grunting]
-[Shredder screeching]

46:03.385 --> 46:05.387
[Alex breathing heavily]

46:10.017 --> 46:11.059
Oh my God.

46:11.143 --> 46:13.771
No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

46:17.858 --> 46:19.693
Ugh! My Nightbooks.

46:19.777 --> 46:20.778
[grunts]

46:41.632 --> 46:43.133
-[Alex] Watch out.
-[Lenore meows]

46:43.217 --> 46:44.802
Lenore's here somewhere.

46:45.552 --> 46:48.222
-She's hurting.
-[Yasmin] You look terrible.

46:48.806 --> 46:52.267
-You've been here all night?
-Yeah, all night. [sighs]

46:53.727 --> 46:56.814
I made this.
It'll help with the scrapes and cuts.

47:00.651 --> 47:03.153
You made this for me?

47:04.780 --> 47:06.532
Yeah, it's my own concoction.

47:07.658 --> 47:11.036
It's a kind of aloe from a harpy plant,
some dried corpse-hair vine.

47:13.956 --> 47:16.375
That's good. Really good.

47:16.458 --> 47:17.292
Thanks.

47:19.586 --> 47:20.963
Uh, Lenore?

47:21.046 --> 47:22.130
[Lenore meows]

47:22.214 --> 47:25.425
-Come here.
-[Lenore meows]

47:25.509 --> 47:27.386
-[purring]
-[Alex grunts]

47:27.469 --> 47:29.137
Look what Yas made for us.

47:29.221 --> 47:30.764
Didn't make it for her.

47:31.515 --> 47:33.892
[Alex] There you go, all better.

47:33.976 --> 47:35.394
It's okay. Here we go.

47:35.477 --> 47:36.311
No.

47:38.480 --> 47:40.482
[Lenore meowing and purring]

47:43.068 --> 47:44.319
I'm in trouble.

47:44.403 --> 47:46.697
I… I… I don't have any stories.

47:46.780 --> 47:49.908
What do you mean you don't have any?
You said you had a bunch of them.

47:49.992 --> 47:52.452
I did, but a Shredder,
it got into my room.

47:52.536 --> 47:56.498
And I killed it,
but it destroyed all of my Nightbooks,

47:56.582 --> 47:57.749
except for this one.

47:57.833 --> 48:00.377
I was reading to Natacha
from those Nightbooks.

48:00.460 --> 48:04.464
I've got nothing now.
I… I have to escape. I have no choice!

48:04.548 --> 48:08.010
There are two ways out. The front door
where you came in and the back door--

48:08.093 --> 48:12.347
The back door! It goes outside.
I saw Natacha go through there. There's--

48:12.431 --> 48:15.183
But Natacha's the only one
that has the keys to that door.

48:15.267 --> 48:18.061
You need to get over
this escape nonsense and write something.

48:18.145 --> 48:20.105
-I've been trying!
-Try harder!

48:20.188 --> 48:21.815
I can't write!

48:23.025 --> 48:26.153
-[sighs]
-Look, Natacha will find out tonight.

48:26.236 --> 48:29.531
-I'll be useless to her. She'll kill me.
-She won't just kill you.

48:37.331 --> 48:38.707
There were four of us.

48:38.790 --> 48:41.585
Eli, Little Hwan, Claire,

48:42.252 --> 48:43.086
and me.

48:45.047 --> 48:48.842
Hwan was too young, but the rest of us
took turns reading to Natacha.

48:50.135 --> 48:52.763
Afterwards,
we'd all huddle together at night

48:54.514 --> 48:56.183
and dream about escaping.

48:56.892 --> 48:59.353
[hesitates] You're saying these are…

49:03.148 --> 49:05.108
Last night, I almost joined them.

49:06.693 --> 49:08.946
One day, the kitchen sink got clogged.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.199
Natacha's magic couldn't fix it.

49:15.369 --> 49:18.956
That's because I blocked the pipe myself
with starstell moss.

49:21.625 --> 49:23.210
The moss resists magic.

49:25.921 --> 49:29.424
[crying] I wanted to force Natacha
to call the plumber.

49:33.011 --> 49:35.806
I taped a note under the sink
for him to find,

49:35.889 --> 49:37.432
begging him to get help.

49:38.809 --> 49:39.643
But…

49:41.853 --> 49:42.980
he never came.

49:44.982 --> 49:47.192
Natacha found the note, didn't she?

49:47.275 --> 49:51.154
Claire spent her last moments
convincing Natacha that she did it…

49:53.198 --> 49:54.116
not me.

49:57.119 --> 50:00.038
Claire lied to save me.

50:02.499 --> 50:05.419
Like… you did.

50:07.796 --> 50:09.589
'Cause that's what friends do.

50:14.678 --> 50:18.348
[breathes shakily]
I used to love writing scary stories,

50:18.432 --> 50:22.519
but then I decided to stop.

50:22.602 --> 50:25.230
And now that I have to write…

50:27.858 --> 50:30.235
the… the ideas won't come to me anymore.

50:39.244 --> 50:40.704
Did Hwan wear a watch?

50:42.581 --> 50:45.125
[Yasmin] Yeah.
A big, blue plastic one. Why?

50:45.709 --> 50:49.671
-And Claire, those earrings?
-[Yasmin] They were her aunt's.

50:51.048 --> 50:51.965
Why?

50:53.675 --> 50:55.761
There's a way out of this place.

50:55.844 --> 50:59.306
-"I have what I need to escape tonight."
-"Escape," Yasmin.

50:59.389 --> 51:02.059
"I'm finally gonna see them again,
Mom and Dad."

51:02.142 --> 51:04.352
"I wonder if they'll remember me."

51:04.436 --> 51:06.396
"Can people forget their kids?"

51:07.856 --> 51:09.816
Unicorn Girl never took this off,

51:09.900 --> 51:12.319
and none of the kids in the cabinet
are wearing it.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.447
[chuckles]

51:15.530 --> 51:18.617
You're right.
And if she's not in the cabinet, then--

51:18.700 --> 51:20.911
She did it. She escaped.

51:20.994 --> 51:24.039
I've been piecing together her notes.
There are bits here and there.

51:24.122 --> 51:27.042
She hid them throughout the books,
so in case Natacha found out--

51:27.125 --> 51:28.960
She wouldn't know her full plan.

51:32.297 --> 51:33.673
Okay, what's your plan?

51:35.675 --> 51:38.178
Your plan sucks.
We're not gonna find this today.

51:38.261 --> 51:40.013
You need to write a story for tonight.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.807
-Like right now.
-[Alex sighs]

51:41.890 --> 51:43.183
What do we do?

51:43.266 --> 51:46.770
It'd take, like, a thousand years
to search all these books.

51:49.940 --> 51:51.024
A thousand years.

51:52.317 --> 51:53.985
The thousand-year-old book.

51:55.320 --> 51:57.572
The pen marks in the old book!

51:57.656 --> 51:59.991
[breathing heavily]

52:10.043 --> 52:12.838
Come on. Please be here.

52:15.465 --> 52:17.634
Is this the original "Hansel and Gretel"?

52:17.717 --> 52:19.261
[Alex] Grimm's Fairy Tales.

52:19.344 --> 52:21.263
[Yasmin] That's totally unrealistic.

52:21.346 --> 52:24.057
No one would just eat candy
off of a strange house.

52:27.727 --> 52:29.437
[gasps] I was right! More writing!

52:29.521 --> 52:31.690
[Yasmin] It's a recipe
for a sleeping potion.

52:34.359 --> 52:35.443
"It smells awful."

52:35.527 --> 52:38.572
"I need to figure out
how to hide the stink so she'll drink it."

52:38.655 --> 52:41.825
"I'm so close.
I'll put her to sleep and steal her keys."

52:41.908 --> 52:43.368
"I wish I had magic."

52:43.451 --> 52:46.788
"I'd turn her into a toad or a snail
and laugh at her all day long."

52:46.872 --> 52:50.167
"Then I would turn her into a centipede
and rip off her legs."

52:50.250 --> 52:51.960
"All hundred legs,

52:52.043 --> 52:53.044
one at a time."

52:55.463 --> 52:58.175
I'll keep looking.
You have to write a story.

52:59.801 --> 53:01.845
[hesitates] I don't think I can.

53:01.928 --> 53:04.806
You're the only one who can.
You've gotta buy us more time.

53:06.016 --> 53:07.559
You don't think I'm weird?

53:11.479 --> 53:12.314
That I…

53:13.857 --> 53:16.234
I like to write scary stories?

53:17.903 --> 53:18.778
Weird?

53:20.363 --> 53:21.823
Who called you that?

53:23.617 --> 53:25.702
Well, they're right. You are weird.

53:27.370 --> 53:28.788
I mean, look at you.

53:30.665 --> 53:34.377
But the thing that makes you weird
makes them ordinary.

53:35.253 --> 53:38.131
And no one likes to be ordinary.
Ordinary sucks.

53:38.215 --> 53:41.551
So ordinary people are gonna try
and take that away from you…

53:43.553 --> 53:45.180
by calling you names like

53:46.932 --> 53:49.476
-Tryhard or--
-Creepshow.

53:52.103 --> 53:54.231
Yeah, or Creepshow.

53:58.360 --> 53:59.444
Thanks, Yasmin.

54:02.739 --> 54:03.657
It's Yas.

54:07.118 --> 54:08.745
Do you have those ingredients?

54:09.704 --> 54:11.122
[Yasmin] Yeah. Yeah, I do.

54:11.206 --> 54:13.792
But she's right. Suckleweed stinks.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.586
How did she mask the smell?

54:17.087 --> 54:19.297
She must've found another ingredient.

54:19.798 --> 54:22.634
[Yasmin] The only other person
who would know is Natacha,

54:22.717 --> 54:24.219
but she would never tell us.

54:25.929 --> 54:27.138
I do have an idea.

54:27.806 --> 54:30.058
I could write a story
to trick her into giving us

54:30.141 --> 54:32.269
the final ingredient
of the sleeping potion.

54:32.352 --> 54:35.397
[Yasmin] You know what happens
if she figures out what we're up to?

54:35.480 --> 54:37.399
[Alex] I know what happens
if we don't try.

54:37.482 --> 54:39.317
[Yasmin] What's the name of the story?

54:41.278 --> 54:45.073
[dramatic music playing]

54:45.156 --> 54:46.408
[Natacha] Not that one.

54:47.158 --> 54:48.702
You're happy with that one.

54:51.037 --> 54:52.580
I don't like you happy.

54:53.164 --> 54:56.751
I want a story that'll make you squirm.

54:58.086 --> 54:59.879
Here's the story I want.

55:01.589 --> 55:04.718
Why burn your Nightbooks?

55:04.801 --> 55:05.635
Uh…

55:05.719 --> 55:07.762
You thought I forgot about that,
didn't you?

55:08.805 --> 55:09.723
I was…

55:09.806 --> 55:13.476
I was… I just… I was… [sighs]

55:13.560 --> 55:16.730
-[dish clattering]
-[meows]

55:18.148 --> 55:19.190
[Yasmin gasps]

55:19.274 --> 55:21.109
Uh… Oh my God.

55:21.693 --> 55:23.611
I'm so sorry. I'm so stupid.

55:23.695 --> 55:26.239
Yes, you are.
I've only been saying that for years.

55:26.323 --> 55:27.866
Now you get it. [sighs heavily]

55:27.949 --> 55:29.409
Where was I?

55:29.492 --> 55:31.411
You were about to tell me
to start reading.

55:31.494 --> 55:34.497
Oh yes.
Well then, what are you waiting for?

55:34.581 --> 55:35.498
Get on with it.

55:38.668 --> 55:41.588
-[spraying]
-[inhaling]

55:41.671 --> 55:44.299
[Alex] "For generations,
the evil sorcerer of Quantel

55:44.382 --> 55:48.136
sent children to mine jewels
from the mouth of the great monster."

55:48.219 --> 55:50.847
[dramatic music playing]

55:54.351 --> 55:55.685
[Alex] "A thousand years ago,

55:55.769 --> 55:58.646
the evil sorcerer had a chance
to kill the odious beast,

55:58.730 --> 56:03.234
but instead he used a powerful potion
to keep the monster unconscious,

56:03.318 --> 56:05.070
to make himself rich."

56:05.153 --> 56:08.198
"Odious." Good word.

56:10.408 --> 56:12.911
[Alex] "Every morning,
the sorcerer funneled his potion

56:12.994 --> 56:15.288
down the monster's fifth ear,

56:15.372 --> 56:17.582
and the beast remained unconscious."

56:17.665 --> 56:19.876
"The recipe was as old as time."

56:19.959 --> 56:23.129
"Dissolved rat's bones,
dry-aged widow orchid,

56:23.213 --> 56:25.215
powdered beetle shells."

56:25.298 --> 56:29.344
"But the most important ingredient,
however, was bindweed."

56:29.928 --> 56:31.346
"Bindweed was the only thing

56:31.429 --> 56:33.973
that could hide
the powerful stench of the potion."

56:34.057 --> 56:37.852
"Without it, the rancid smell
would rouse the great monster."

56:37.936 --> 56:41.314
"But one day, the sorcerer
went to harvest more bindweed,

56:41.398 --> 56:45.235
and he discovered that the entire field
had withered and died."

56:45.735 --> 56:48.113
"The potion smelled worse than ever."

56:48.196 --> 56:51.366
"Putrid, rank, malodorous--"

56:51.449 --> 56:54.244
Oh, yes, yes, yes. Understood. It stinks.

56:54.327 --> 56:59.457
[Alex] "The sorcerer would have to kill
the great monster once and for all."

56:59.541 --> 57:03.336
"He reluctantly raised his mighty staff
to kill the beast,

57:03.420 --> 57:07.048
but a peasant girl came to him
and promised a solution to his problem."

57:07.132 --> 57:10.677
I know a replacement for bindweed.
Your jewel harvest can continue.

57:10.760 --> 57:13.555
Foolish child.
You know nothing of real magic.

57:13.638 --> 57:17.016
I can prove it.
And if I do, I want a bag of jewels.

57:17.517 --> 57:20.270
If it works, you will get two bags.

57:20.353 --> 57:23.606
If not, you will give me your life.

57:24.691 --> 57:26.526
[Alex] "The peasant girl stepped forward

57:26.609 --> 57:29.821
and poured a mysterious dark liquid
into the jug."

57:31.364 --> 57:33.575
"The evil sorcerer sniffed the potion."

57:33.658 --> 57:36.703
"The smell disappeared.
The sorcerer couldn't believe it."

57:37.287 --> 57:40.874
"It smelled like daisies,
roses, lilacs on a spring morning--"

57:40.957 --> 57:42.167
[groans impatiently]

57:44.544 --> 57:46.504
[Alex] "The evil sorcerer
poured the potion

57:46.588 --> 57:48.965
into the monster's ear and waited."

57:49.048 --> 57:52.051
"The beast let out a long…
[in low voice] …grumble

57:52.135 --> 57:53.928
then went still again."

57:54.012 --> 57:59.058
"Yes! But the peasant girl had removed
more than just the smell from the potion."

57:59.684 --> 58:02.312
"She'd also erased all of its magic."

58:02.896 --> 58:05.648
"The sorcerer's potion
was rendered useless."

58:06.316 --> 58:08.860
"The peasant girl nodded
to something behind him."

58:08.943 --> 58:10.737
[monster growling]

58:10.820 --> 58:13.823
[Alex] "The eyes
of the great monster were open."

58:13.907 --> 58:15.658
"The sorcerer shrieked."

58:15.742 --> 58:18.703
[Alex] "The peasant girl
watched it all, smiling."

58:18.786 --> 58:22.665
"The evil sorcerer had sent
her baby brother into that cave,

58:22.749 --> 58:24.334
and he never returned."

58:24.834 --> 58:26.878
"The peasant girl
cared nothing about jewels."

58:26.961 --> 58:28.880
"She got what she wanted, revenge."

58:28.963 --> 58:30.381
"And so she walked away

58:30.465 --> 58:34.385

The mist, that's where it comes from.

1:15:25.896 --> 1:15:27.272
You're harvesting it.

1:15:27.898 --> 1:15:29.983
Who's inside that coffin?

1:15:32.319 --> 1:15:33.862
[distorted] The original witch,

1:15:35.531 --> 1:15:39.660
who, by the way, does eat children.

1:15:40.827 --> 1:15:44.665
We thought you were the original witch.
We thought the blue mist kept you young.

1:15:44.748 --> 1:15:47.876
I don't need the mist to keep me young.

1:15:47.960 --> 1:15:49.545
It gives me her magic.

1:15:49.628 --> 1:15:50.462
What?

1:15:51.046 --> 1:15:52.130
How?

1:15:52.631 --> 1:15:55.467
I was about your age when she got me.

1:15:55.968 --> 1:15:58.095
There were lots of us back then.

1:15:59.096 --> 1:16:01.223
But we weren't dumb.

1:16:02.015 --> 1:16:04.309
We knew not to get attached,

1:16:04.393 --> 1:16:07.604
because she got hungry.

1:16:08.105 --> 1:16:09.273
She ate them?

1:16:12.025 --> 1:16:13.151
Yes.

1:16:13.986 --> 1:16:15.862
[giggles]

1:16:15.946 --> 1:16:17.114
All of them.

1:16:17.656 --> 1:16:20.409
[orb humming]

1:16:22.536 --> 1:16:26.248
[Natacha] And then I…
I had to clean the oven.

1:16:27.874 --> 1:16:29.960
I pretended to like her.

1:16:30.544 --> 1:16:33.130
Pretended to want to be like her.

1:16:33.213 --> 1:16:35.007
I became her favorite.

1:16:35.924 --> 1:16:39.928
But when I was alone, I plotted my escape.

1:16:42.889 --> 1:16:45.017
I would get her to trust me.

1:16:47.519 --> 1:16:50.147
And then, a sleeping potion,

1:16:51.106 --> 1:16:52.482
and I would be free.

1:16:53.483 --> 1:16:55.402
I ran straight home…

1:17:04.369 --> 1:17:06.038
but my parents were gone.

1:17:07.414 --> 1:17:08.540
They left you.

1:17:09.708 --> 1:17:11.585
[Natacha] I had nowhere else to go,

1:17:11.668 --> 1:17:13.879
so I came back here.

1:17:16.131 --> 1:17:17.424
[thudding]

1:17:18.759 --> 1:17:20.385
[Natacha] Who cares about them?

1:17:24.056 --> 1:17:25.474
You were just like us.

1:17:27.976 --> 1:17:28.810
Wait.

1:17:29.811 --> 1:17:31.021
The sleeping potion…

1:17:32.773 --> 1:17:34.358
You're Unicorn Girl.

1:17:39.363 --> 1:17:40.280
Ah.

1:17:41.948 --> 1:17:44.076
You read my diaries.

1:17:48.205 --> 1:17:49.581
Did you meet my pet?

1:17:50.082 --> 1:17:51.541
The unicorn?

1:17:53.126 --> 1:17:54.127
That's your pet?

1:17:54.753 --> 1:17:55.754
I made him.

1:17:56.880 --> 1:17:58.632
I make many things now.

1:17:59.132 --> 1:18:01.176
[witch breathing heavily]

1:18:02.511 --> 1:18:04.012
[growling]

1:18:04.096 --> 1:18:05.681
[rumbling]

1:18:08.141 --> 1:18:10.644
[Alex] She's the one
who's been shaking the apartment?

1:18:10.727 --> 1:18:15.440
[Natacha] If she doesn't get a story,
we're all gonna die.

1:18:16.149 --> 1:18:18.902
Stories keep her asleep.

1:18:18.985 --> 1:18:24.533
Stories of fear and suffering and death
are like sweet lullabies to her.

1:18:24.616 --> 1:18:26.034
-Tell one.
-[witch growling]

1:18:26.118 --> 1:18:27.244
I don't have a story.

1:18:27.327 --> 1:18:28.537
Oh, yes, you do.

1:18:28.620 --> 1:18:32.040
Tell us the reason that you wanted
to destroy your Nightbooks.

1:18:33.750 --> 1:18:37.003
-[rumbling subsides]
-But… [exhales] …that's not scary--

1:18:37.087 --> 1:18:38.755
[Natacha] It was, to you.

1:18:39.339 --> 1:18:44.636
All that pain and fear and sadness

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:47.889
that you've been avoiding this whole time.

1:18:47.973 --> 1:18:48.890
Tell it!

1:18:48.974 --> 1:18:51.476
-[rumbling]
-[witch growling]

1:18:55.522 --> 1:18:56.565
Now, Alex!

1:18:56.648 --> 1:18:58.316
You think I'm a bad witch?

1:18:59.067 --> 1:19:01.653
Just wait until she wakes up and sees you.

1:19:02.237 --> 1:19:04.948
So young, so plump, so juicy--

1:19:05.031 --> 1:19:06.366
Okay! Okay!

1:19:06.450 --> 1:19:09.411
[dramatic music playing]

1:19:13.415 --> 1:19:17.461
[Alex] There once was a boy
who… who loved to write scary stories.

1:19:17.544 --> 1:19:19.463
Every day, on his free time,

1:19:19.546 --> 1:19:22.883
he would come up with new ways
to scare his classmates.

1:19:26.678 --> 1:19:28.388
[rumbling and growling subside]

1:19:29.890 --> 1:19:31.433
[Alex breathing shakily]

1:19:31.516 --> 1:19:32.517
[exhales]

1:19:33.852 --> 1:19:35.604
But… [sighs]

1:19:35.687 --> 1:19:39.065
…they just didn't get
his fascination with creepy things.

1:19:39.149 --> 1:19:43.195
To them, he was just… weird.

1:19:44.029 --> 1:19:46.239
"What's wrong with you?" they'd ask.

1:19:46.740 --> 1:19:48.158
Many of them were cruel,

1:19:48.950 --> 1:19:52.329
calling him names, like Creepshow.

1:19:54.331 --> 1:19:55.499
Except for Joshua.

1:19:56.500 --> 1:19:57.918
Josh was his best friend

1:19:59.377 --> 1:20:00.504
since kindergarten.

1:20:02.005 --> 1:20:04.925
Alex finishes
his latest bone-chilling tale,

1:20:05.008 --> 1:20:06.426
and he's excited to share it.

1:20:08.011 --> 1:20:09.930
Hey, you're gonna love this one.

1:20:10.430 --> 1:20:11.389
Josh?

1:20:12.557 --> 1:20:14.518
Hey, Josh?

1:20:15.435 --> 1:20:17.229
[school bell ringing]

1:20:18.146 --> 1:20:20.524
[Alex] Alex catches up with Josh
after class.

1:20:21.399 --> 1:20:23.401
Wait. My birthday's tonight.

1:20:23.485 --> 1:20:25.737
We turned the apartment
into a haunted house.

1:20:25.821 --> 1:20:28.657
It's amazing.
I've got tons of new stories ready.

1:20:29.616 --> 1:20:30.992
Josh talks low,

1:20:31.076 --> 1:20:33.161
not wanting the others to hear.

1:20:33.245 --> 1:20:35.247
Cody's having a gaming party.

1:20:35.330 --> 1:20:37.415
His dad's getting the truck
and everything.

1:20:38.166 --> 1:20:41.127
But to… tonight's my party.

1:20:41.628 --> 1:20:44.923
…says Alex, confused and hurt.

1:20:45.590 --> 1:20:48.426
Alex's hope sinks. He's desperate.

1:20:48.510 --> 1:20:49.469
He says…

1:20:51.263 --> 1:20:53.181
You're my best friend.

1:20:54.057 --> 1:20:55.892
Josh tries to be gentle.

1:20:56.476 --> 1:20:57.477
Yeah, right.

1:20:57.978 --> 1:20:59.563
Cody's my friend now too.

1:20:59.646 --> 1:21:01.231
And you're just not…

1:21:02.524 --> 1:21:03.567
[laughs] Come on.

1:21:04.067 --> 1:21:07.279
The way you dress, the things you like.

1:21:07.362 --> 1:21:10.031
"All you do
is talk about your scary stories."

1:21:11.950 --> 1:21:13.410
Everyone thinks it's weird.

1:21:13.994 --> 1:21:16.621
[Alex] That's when Cody butts in.

1:21:16.705 --> 1:21:18.456
Yo, Josh, you comin'?

1:21:18.540 --> 1:21:19.624
Come on, J-Man.

1:21:20.208 --> 1:21:23.420
All right, all right.
Alex, I'll see you later, okay?

1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:32.470
The boy had written a new story
about a haunted house.

1:21:33.722 --> 1:21:35.974
[crying] He, his mom, and his dad

1:21:36.683 --> 1:21:39.311
had turned his whole apartment
into that house.

1:21:39.394 --> 1:21:42.314
[dad and mom arguing indistinctly]

1:21:42.397 --> 1:21:43.773
No one showed up…

1:21:46.067 --> 1:21:47.569
not even Josh.

1:21:48.236 --> 1:21:49.237
[cries]

1:21:55.493 --> 1:22:00.624
They made him hate
the thing he loved most.

1:22:02.584 --> 1:22:05.003
And they made him hate himself.

1:22:10.717 --> 1:22:16.097
The real truth is,
he was embarrassed to be himself,

1:22:17.307 --> 1:22:19.726
so he decided to burn his Nightbooks.

1:22:19.809 --> 1:22:20.810
[screams]

1:22:20.894 --> 1:22:24.022
He swore he'd never write
another story again.

1:22:25.565 --> 1:22:26.524
He could be

1:22:27.859 --> 1:22:28.902
a new person.

1:22:29.819 --> 1:22:31.905
Not weird.

1:22:32.405 --> 1:22:33.865
Not a freak.

1:22:34.366 --> 1:22:35.992
He could be normal,

1:22:36.785 --> 1:22:39.788
like Josh and his friends.

1:22:42.624 --> 1:22:44.334
Then he wouldn't be alone.

1:22:49.047 --> 1:22:50.048
[sobbing]

1:22:51.299 --> 1:22:53.093
[Natacha laughs]

1:22:56.221 --> 1:22:59.140
The boy lost all his friends,

1:22:59.224 --> 1:23:01.810
so he decided to destroy
that part of himself

1:23:01.893 --> 1:23:03.853
that created the Nightbooks.

1:23:03.937 --> 1:23:05.814
Then a witch captured him.

1:23:06.564 --> 1:23:08.692
She said she liked his stories.

1:23:11.736 --> 1:23:13.321
The witch was lying.

1:23:13.947 --> 1:23:15.323
But being captured by her

1:23:15.407 --> 1:23:17.617
was the best thing
that ever happened to me…

1:23:17.701 --> 1:23:19.869
[rumbling]

1:23:19.953 --> 1:23:21.413
…because I made new friends,

1:23:23.289 --> 1:23:27.293
friends who love me for who I am,
not for who they want me to be.

1:23:27.377 --> 1:23:29.212
What have you done? No!

1:23:30.046 --> 1:23:30.880
No!

1:23:30.964 --> 1:23:33.091
[witch groaning]

1:23:33.174 --> 1:23:34.926
-[meows]
-No.

1:23:35.010 --> 1:23:37.429
-No!
-This is our happy ending!

1:23:37.512 --> 1:23:39.264
No happy endings.

1:23:44.144 --> 1:23:46.938
-Guys, let's get out of here.
-Fine.

1:23:47.022 --> 1:23:48.148
[Natacha] No!

1:23:48.231 --> 1:23:51.401
Oh! No! No, you idiot!

1:23:51.484 --> 1:23:54.779
What have you done? You stupid children.

1:23:54.863 --> 1:23:56.656
No! No!

1:23:56.740 --> 1:23:57.866
[screams]

1:23:57.949 --> 1:24:00.076
-[Yasmin and Alex yell]
-[Natacha screams]

1:24:01.745 --> 1:24:03.496

[voices whispering]

1:24:09.502 --> 1:24:10.712
[breathing heavily]

1:24:15.759 --> 1:24:16.676
[Natacha gasps]

1:24:16.760 --> 1:24:19.971
[groans, grunts]

1:24:20.055 --> 1:24:23.933
-[witch wheezing and grunting]
-[Natacha] Oh God! Oh God!

-[bones cracking]
-[witch groaning]

1:24:31.483 --> 1:24:32.901
Oh God.

1:24:33.818 --> 1:24:36.321
[sinister music playing]

1:24:39.783 --> 1:24:41.367
[bones cracking]

1:24:42.077 --> 1:24:43.828
[laughing nervously]

1:24:45.455 --> 1:24:49.542
[bones cracking]

1:24:56.424 --> 1:24:58.426
[Yasmin and Alex breathing shakily]

1:25:01.930 --> 1:25:03.932
[bones popping]

1:25:10.772 --> 1:25:11.731
You're awake.

1:25:12.565 --> 1:25:13.525
Finally.

1:25:14.109 --> 1:25:18.238
You've been asleep here so long,
the… the candy is infecting you.

1:25:18.321 --> 1:25:19.447
[breathes shakily]

1:25:19.531 --> 1:25:20.865
You…

1:25:21.825 --> 1:25:23.284
[meows]

1:25:23.368 --> 1:25:25.245
You did this to me.

1:25:25.328 --> 1:25:30.708
I have lived in fear of you for so long,
but I am not that little girl anymore.

1:25:31.292 --> 1:25:33.419
[whooshing]

1:25:34.838 --> 1:25:36.381
Witch fight!

1:25:36.464 --> 1:25:37.966
-Let's get out of here!
-Let's go!

1:25:41.136 --> 1:25:42.470
[Yasmin] Go! Just go!

1:25:42.554 --> 1:25:44.931
-[grunting]
-[Yasmin] Go! Go!

1:25:46.808 --> 1:25:49.185
[Natacha and witch screaming]

1:25:58.570 --> 1:26:01.739
[witch laughing maniacally]

1:26:04.742 --> 1:26:06.744
[Yasmin and Alex panting]

1:26:15.003 --> 1:26:18.715
Help! We need help! Get us out of here!

1:26:18.798 --> 1:26:21.009
A witch is gonna eat us!

1:26:21.092 --> 1:26:22.135
Help!

1:26:22.635 --> 1:26:24.429
Can anyone hear me?

1:26:24.512 --> 1:26:27.807
[Yasmin] Alex, move.
I've seen Natacha do this.

1:26:29.893 --> 1:26:31.895
[inhales]

1:26:34.314 --> 1:26:35.190
Yas?

1:26:39.027 --> 1:26:39.861
Yasmin?

1:26:40.862 --> 1:26:42.864
[humming]

1:26:43.448 --> 1:26:45.033
-[whooshing]
-[Alex gasps]

1:26:45.617 --> 1:26:46.576
Whoa!

1:26:47.744 --> 1:26:48.703
You… you did it.

1:26:49.370 --> 1:26:50.371
You did it.

1:26:50.455 --> 1:26:51.706
[laughs]

1:26:54.751 --> 1:26:58.046
-[witch] I'm home.
-Let's go.

1:26:58.129 --> 1:26:59.130
[witch laughs]

1:27:00.089 --> 1:27:00.965
[meows]

1:27:01.049 --> 1:27:02.425
-Lenore!
-[Yasmin] We gotta go.

1:27:03.009 --> 1:27:04.093
[witch laughing]

1:27:04.177 --> 1:27:06.596
We're still in my building.
The apartment didn't move.

1:27:07.263 --> 1:27:08.806
[Alex breathes heavily]

1:27:09.432 --> 1:27:12.477
-Do you have a plan?
-Not exactly a plan, an idea.

1:27:16.773 --> 1:27:17.941
-[thudding]
-[both gasp]

1:27:18.024 --> 1:27:19.567
[witch] Hello, children.

1:27:19.651 --> 1:27:22.278
[witch growling]

1:27:22.362 --> 1:27:25.240
I'm so hungry.

1:27:26.824 --> 1:27:28.368
[gasping]

1:27:28.451 --> 1:27:30.912
[both panting]

1:27:33.248 --> 1:27:36.709
[all screaming]

1:27:43.758 --> 1:27:46.261
This is the worst elevator ever!

1:27:46.803 --> 1:27:49.180
