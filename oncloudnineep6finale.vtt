00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.900
It's almost 99 days.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.440
Mork, Mork...

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.160
Mork, Mork...Mork...

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.880
You don't have to worry about me.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.880
Everything will be alright.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.420
I forgive you for everything.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.820
What makes me most happy is that 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:48.240
the two of us were born together.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.620
Our minds are still connected, right?

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.880
You may be going somewhere.

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.100
I hope that...

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.720
you'll be lucky to meet P'Tiew.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:04.520
I wish both of you stay together.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:18.460
Is everything alright?

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.460
Yes...

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.820
In this world, 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.300
Every spirit can live 99 days...

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.500
after death.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.780
Why? For what?

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
The spirit will be living for happiness...

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.400
before it's gone...

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.140
Some spirits request to be gone early.

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.240
Some spirits still are here and waiting for...

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.240
What are they waiting for?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.300
They're waiting for the one they love...

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.200
the one who's not met for so long.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.920
It's such a romantic!

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.300
Anyway,...

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.340
the cafe is closed now.

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.940
You should go back.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.400
I have something to let you know.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:29.060
I'm sorry that I came back to you late

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:31.060
Are you in a relationship?

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:33.160
I'm not.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:35.160
Or...

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:37.160
you don't like me?

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.600
Nope...

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.440
I'm sorry that I came back to you late.

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:00.980
I could not remember.

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.960
until I drank that dew.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.280
How about you?

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.220
How are you?

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:31.500
If I say that...

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.840
I won't live in this world...

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:41.860
will you love me?

00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:43.860
What are you crazy talking about?

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:45.860
It's not funny.

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:55.080
I'm serious.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.320
You're going to say that you died?

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.380
Yes...

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:39.660
I don't believe you!

00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.780
When?

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:14.220
Tomorrow is my 99th day.

00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:38.160
I'm so sorry.

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:41.400
I've not known anything about you.

00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.940
It's okay.

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.360
We're here now.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.040
You came back to me...

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.220
I have a chance to see you again...

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.500
I have been blessed.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.280
Please.... stay with me

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:26.280
Don't leave me...

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.540
I want to be with you.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.780
Please stay with me tonight...

00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:48.700
Mork...

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:55.480
I have one more thing to tell you...

00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:03.040
If it's a sad story, I don't want to hear it.

00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:09.560
We've never done something the lovers do.

00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.980
I think so.

00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:04.280
Don't try so hard.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:14.560
Without this, it doesn't mean that we're not lovers.

00:14:19.460 --> 00:14:21.460
We're holding each other tonight is fine.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.740
I do love you.

00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:00.500
P'Tiew...

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.420
P'Tiew...

00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:07.420
P'Tiew...

00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.220
P'Tiew...

00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:35.120
P'Tiew...

00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.800
P'Tiew...

00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:49.740
P'Tiew...

00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.740
P'Tiew...

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:54.060
P'Tiew...

00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.660
P'Tiew...

00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.500
P'Tiew...

00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:01.500
P'...

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.860
P'Tiew...

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.480
Where did you go?

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:21.480
I didn't go anywhere.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.480
I went for a drink of the dew.

00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.480
I thought that I would not see you again.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.160
Why didn't you wake me up?

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.460
I saw you slept well.

00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:33.460
So I decided not to disturb you.

00:20:33.780 --> 00:20:35.460
By the way...

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.280
someone tried to nudge me all night.

00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.280
What are you talking about?

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:49.380
You're so cute!. Can I...?

00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:51.680
You're crazy!

00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.780
Mork...

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:19.680
Are you ready to hear another story?

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.680
What's a story?

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:36.800
What's the story? I'm a bit frightened.

00:21:43.660 --> 00:21:46.360
Actually, you always wear white clothes.

00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:51.240
Impossible!

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:59.320
Where's white? This is white and here is black. It's totally different.

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:01.320
Are you colorblind?

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:06.440
Till now you don't believe that you wear white clothes, right?

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:08.840
No! I'm wearing...

00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:13.460
What's the color?

00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:19.440
What are you doing?

00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:23.000
You can cast the spell, don't you?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I can't.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.620
You always wear white clothes. Think carefully.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:54.220
Going together makes us know each other more and more.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.680
I think this white color suits yours.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:08.040
If you go back home right now, you still can't enter your house.

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:18.680
Did I die?

00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:29.480
Yes, you died.

00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:35.320
I've tried to tell you several times, but...

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:39.940
I'm afraid that you can't accept the truth.

00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:46.740
Finally, you have to accept the truth.

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.840
I can't believe.

00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:04.340
Things like smartphones and rucksacks are not necessary in this world.

00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.240
We don't need to use them.

00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.240
Where is my rucksack?

00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:11.500
You'll get used to...

00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:12.820
Where is my phone?

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:14.820
You're not used to...

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:26.340
Humans and spirits can not feel or touch each other.

00:25:06.740 --> 00:25:08.740
Can you feel it?

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:10.740
Hmm.

00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:43.920
Now you know that we can feel and touch each other.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:50.120
I don't know whether to feel good or sad about this.

00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:57.400
At last, we met.

00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.040
Why you just told me? How about last night...

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:10.000
Last night, we were happy together.

00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:19.640
You're kidding me, aren't you?

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:35.360
Are you okay?

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.360
I'm okay.

00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:47.720
Thanks so much for waiting for me a long time.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:55.020
For you, I can wait for no matter.

00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:02.040
Mork...

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:06.040
I do love you.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.040
I love you too.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.240
Did you remember about 99 days?

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:49.540
Sure.

00:27:53.540 --> 00:28:03.320
The spirit will have a chance to feel the last happiness within 99 days after the last breath.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:19.100
And then, the spirit needs to move to somewhere I don't know.

00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:29.700
It's my time now.

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:39.980
I'm going to move somewhere now.

00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:45.860
Please don't go...

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.860
But I have to...

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.700
Don't cry...

00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:15.420
I have a chance to meet you...and to love you....I'm so happy.

00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:25.700
I don't know when we will meet again or not.

00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:39.420
Now I feel great for us.

00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:44.760
Let me go with you now.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:54.840
Mork...

00:29:56.420 --> 00:30:01.560
You still have more than 90 days to feel the last happiness.

00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.760
Please... I don't want you to wait for me any longer.

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.900
Let's go together.

00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.920
Are you sure?

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:37.920
Hmm...

00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.840
