00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:16.767
Babe, look.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.316
Yogurt, 100 boxes.

00:01:19.916 --> 00:01:20.798
Have they delivered?

00:01:20.798 --> 00:01:21.962
Yes, they have!

00:01:21.962 --> 00:01:23.126
They did. Okay.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.080
Coffee. 100 boxes.

00:01:27.632 --> 00:01:28.628
They came too, right?

00:01:28.628 --> 00:01:29.493
Yes.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.680
What else?

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.501
Here. Oranges.

00:01:32.783 --> 00:01:33.459
Um.

00:01:37.092 --> 00:01:37.820
Huh?

00:01:38.244 --> 00:01:39.225
Why is he dressing up?

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:42.992
What if... they got back together?

00:01:43.492 --> 00:01:44.133
Let me see.

00:01:44.592 --> 00:01:45.192
Phuc!

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:48.217
Yes?

00:01:48.464 --> 00:01:49.867
Are you on a date?

00:01:53.288 --> 00:01:54.000
Hey.

00:01:54.176 --> 00:01:55.325
Your plan was amazing!

00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:56.652
Geez! Of course!

00:01:56.652 --> 00:01:59.120
I'm not so pretty, but I'm so smart!

00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:01.161
Is it Thach?

00:02:03.277 --> 00:02:04.289
 Huh?

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.688
 I thought it'd be Thach.

00:02:05.688 --> 00:02:06.249
Hi, boy.

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.813
Hello!

00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:08.012
How long have you waited?

00:02:08.012 --> 00:02:08.647
I just came here!

00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:11.461
Oh no! This is not okay. Now, you should come there.

00:02:11.461 --> 00:02:12.162
Take their orders.

00:02:12.162 --> 00:02:13.342
I'll call Thach right now! Okay?

00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:14.193
Try to buy more time!

00:02:14.193 --> 00:02:15.026
Okay.

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:16.477
Okay. I'm coming right now!

00:02:35.347 --> 00:02:36.298
Hello, I'm listening.

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:37.321
Hello, is that you?

00:02:37.497 --> 00:02:38.215
Yes, I'm here.

00:02:38.215 --> 00:02:39.719
How can you sleep now? Wake up!

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:41.190
We're in hot water.

00:02:41.402 --> 00:02:42.216
What's happened to Phuc?

00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:45.134
It's you! Something's wrong with you!

00:02:45.134 --> 00:02:46.279
I'd like a black coffee.

00:02:46.561 --> 00:02:47.408
Black coffee?

00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:48.995
Sorry, sir.

00:02:48.995 --> 00:02:51.174
We've just ran out of it.

00:02:51.597 --> 00:02:52.659
You can even run out of black coffee?

00:02:53.505 --> 00:02:55.212
We've just ran out of it.

00:02:55.212 --> 00:02:57.172
Come quickly! Phuc's seeing someone!

00:02:57.172 --> 00:02:59.841
Ah! Hold on!

00:03:01.224 --> 00:03:03.595
What's happened? Did you fall? Are you okay?

00:03:05.485 --> 00:03:07.234
Uh, calm down!

00:03:07.234 --> 00:03:08.518
Help me buy time! I'll be there soon!

00:03:08.518 --> 00:03:09.807
Okay. Got it!

00:03:11.147 --> 00:03:12.265
Haizz. I should brush my teeth.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.244
Change my clothes. Where are my slippers?

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:21.854
Then, I'd like a yogurt.

00:03:21.854 --> 00:03:22.953
Yogurt?

00:03:22.953 --> 00:03:24.906
Yogurt hasn't been delivered.

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.640
We've ran out of yogurt too?

00:03:27.275 --> 00:03:29.212
Yes, we have. You can have iced tea.

00:03:29.812 --> 00:03:32.849
Iced tea is okay. But, I think it will take a while.

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:34.194
Then, go make it.

00:03:34.441 --> 00:03:36.988
Or, you can order some food!

00:04:19.452 --> 00:04:20.833
I want fried noodles.

00:04:21.115 --> 00:04:22.207
Fried noodles?

00:04:22.383 --> 00:04:23.789
We've ran out of it too.

00:04:24.177 --> 00:04:26.145
Um... I'd like a Pho then.

00:04:26.356 --> 00:04:27.233
You want Pho, sir?

00:04:27.797 --> 00:04:30.706
Oh, our water boiler is being maintained.

00:04:31.023 --> 00:04:33.138
Then, bring us whatever you have.

00:04:38.323 --> 00:04:40.492
Oh, I just remember that

00:04:41.056 --> 00:04:42.506
we still have black coffee in the stock.

00:04:43.106 --> 00:04:45.298
Yogurt just arrived yesterday.

00:04:45.298 --> 00:04:47.417
And Nu just bought noodles.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.443
So, one yogurt for Phuc,

00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.080
- and one black coffee for...
- Truong.

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.934
Your drinks will be out soon.

00:05:01.835 --> 00:05:03.363
He's here!

00:05:05.691 --> 00:05:06.846
Where will we go next?

00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:09.889
What about my house?

00:05:10.453 --> 00:05:11.017
Uh...

00:05:11.787 --> 00:05:12.557
Who are you?

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.506
I'm his boyfriend.

00:05:16.718 --> 00:05:17.218
Huh?

00:05:17.712 --> 00:05:19.890
Woah! A direct strike!

00:05:20.102 --> 00:05:21.379
That's my brother!

00:05:22.014 --> 00:05:22.936
What a shame!

00:05:22.936 --> 00:05:26.053
We were having a fight so he came to you.

00:05:26.053 --> 00:05:27.205
Don't be like this again, okay?

00:05:27.205 --> 00:05:29.239
Phuc said he's still single!

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:31.669
No one gets mad at his boyfriend and still says he's about to get married!

00:05:32.269 --> 00:05:33.743
Tell me! What is this?

00:05:33.743 --> 00:05:35.658
Uh... I... I...

00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:37.813
I can't believe you are like this!

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.464
Seeing 2 people at a time... You're terrible!

00:05:41.464 --> 00:05:42.695
Terrible!

00:05:45.164 --> 00:05:46.686
He was so manly at first!

00:05:46.898 --> 00:05:48.706
You shouldn't say that.

00:05:49.235 --> 00:05:50.874
I'm sorry.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.217
Duy, I'd like a water.

00:05:55.217 --> 00:05:56.189
Okay, I'll bring it out now.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:57.260
  What were you doing?

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.243
Don't take it off.

00:05:58.243 --> 00:06:00.804
I begged you to stop this!

00:06:01.227 --> 00:06:03.730
Why do I have to stop?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.072
Who are you?

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:10.915
Tell me the truth. What is your name?

00:06:10.915 --> 00:06:13.546
My name is... Phong.

00:06:14.922 --> 00:06:17.425
If you do this again, I'll quit!

00:06:41.408 --> 00:06:44.566
Duy, don't bring me water. Any beer or wine will do.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.628
Don't!

00:07:03.497 --> 00:07:04.294
Hey, Thach.

00:07:04.794 --> 00:07:05.435
I beg you!

00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:06.454
Thach!

00:07:06.454 --> 00:07:07.718
Answer my call!

00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:08.392
Thach!

00:07:08.392 --> 00:07:09.936
Just once!

00:07:10.888 --> 00:07:12.000
Thach!

00:07:24.591 --> 00:07:25.733
How long did I sleep?

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:27.145
Not long.

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.515
Do you trust your feelings?

00:07:39.277 --> 00:07:41.112
Though it's been so long,

00:07:41.677 --> 00:07:43.680
so long and I haven't seen his face,

00:07:44.914 --> 00:07:47.360
just some tiny details

00:07:48.771 --> 00:07:50.718
can suddenly make my heart shakes.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.476
What's your name?

00:07:57.662 --> 00:07:58.938
I'm... Phong.

00:08:09.166 --> 00:08:10.470
You can leave early today.

00:08:57.326 --> 00:08:58.513
Phong!

00:08:59.677 --> 00:09:00.332
Yes?

00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:02.378
Help me tie my tie.

00:09:12.217 --> 00:09:14.722
Huh? It was already tied.

00:09:16.838 --> 00:09:17.773
My hand's hurting.

00:09:19.431 --> 00:09:20.641
You really like to torture others!

00:09:28.541 --> 00:09:29.887
How long have you done this job?

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.332
Not long.

00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.406
6 years ago,

00:09:38.111 --> 00:09:40.272
I hired a helper like you.

00:10:12.387 --> 00:10:13.508
It's done.

00:10:14.223 --> 00:10:15.608
Do you have any plans for this holiday?

00:10:16.108 --> 00:10:18.230
I... I'll go home.

00:10:21.157 --> 00:10:22.430
What about you?

00:10:26.346 --> 00:10:27.722
Just like any other days.

00:10:31.884 --> 00:10:34.480
I... I should get out and continue my work.

00:11:05.435 --> 00:11:06.850
Have some juice.

00:11:06.850 --> 00:11:07.624
Yes.

00:11:09.634 --> 00:11:11.367
You can quit your job here.

00:11:11.684 --> 00:11:15.285
Working at Thach's place and then coming here is too tiring.

00:11:15.285 --> 00:11:17.615
I've been working here for so long. I'll be very sad if I quit.

00:11:19.954 --> 00:11:22.646
Uh... Will you keep this secret for life?

00:11:23.598 --> 00:11:26.627
At least, if you can't be lovers, you still can be friends.

00:11:26.627 --> 00:11:27.705
But...

00:11:28.234 --> 00:11:30.193
it'll get our hopes up.

00:11:30.651 --> 00:11:32.695
Then, why don't you give each other a chance?

00:11:33.683 --> 00:11:35.384
Finding someone who loves you is really hard.

00:11:35.631 --> 00:11:37.746
Don't let go if you're together.

00:11:38.169 --> 00:11:41.170
Don't leave when you held each other's hands.

00:11:43.145 --> 00:11:47.491
At that time, if I had been selfish or blind in love,

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.928
you two would still be together now.

00:11:49.928 --> 00:11:52.252
For me, Thach can have his sight back

00:11:52.252 --> 00:11:53.256
which is the most important thing.

00:11:53.503 --> 00:11:54.495
But for Thach,

00:11:54.495 --> 00:11:57.564
the days he spent with you were the most beautiful things.

00:11:58.481 --> 00:12:00.488
Finding someone who loves you isn't easy, Phuc.

00:12:00.488 --> 00:12:02.954
You two have been through so many things.

00:12:03.166 --> 00:12:05.612
It was all paid with your tears and pains.

00:12:06.282 --> 00:12:11.838
Thach's still single and you are too. You two should give each other a chance.

00:12:12.826 --> 00:12:14.993
I hope you and Thach can be happy.

00:12:15.522 --> 00:12:16.683
I made up my mind.

00:12:17.071 --> 00:12:20.455
I promised her too. I can't break it.

00:12:20.455 --> 00:12:21.309
Her?

00:12:21.309 --> 00:12:22.385
Thach's mother.

00:12:22.385 --> 00:12:24.773
Our time is over.

00:12:25.126 --> 00:12:26.429
We'll break up again anyway.

00:12:26.429 --> 00:12:28.205
We weren't made for each other.

00:12:28.593 --> 00:12:30.636
You always think of others, but who'll think of you?

00:12:31.341 --> 00:12:33.203
You think it's easy to find someone who loves you?

00:12:33.203 --> 00:12:35.424
Not to mention Thach loves you so much!

00:12:35.424 --> 00:12:37.153
I'm pissed even though I'm not in this.

00:12:37.153 --> 00:12:38.821
Thank you for thinking of me.

00:12:38.821 --> 00:12:41.500
But... I made my decision.

00:12:44.956 --> 00:12:46.587
I should continue working.

00:12:54.346 --> 00:12:55.760
Can we talk a bit?

00:13:04.811 --> 00:13:07.355
I don't talk to my boss outside working hours.

00:13:08.907 --> 00:13:10.028
I'm begging you.

00:13:12.603 --> 00:13:13.675
Just for a while.

00:13:16.849 --> 00:13:18.212
Did you have beers? 

00:13:20.928 --> 00:13:21.832
How do you know?

00:13:23.278 --> 00:13:25.352
You drive yourself. Don't drink too much.

00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:27.943
You can take me home!

00:13:27.943 --> 00:13:29.991
- If it's late, you can sleep over.
- Thach!

00:13:32.601 --> 00:13:33.942
I've always thought of you.

00:13:35.459 --> 00:13:37.815
In the last 6 years, I've always thought of you.

00:13:37.815 --> 00:13:38.876
Thach!

00:13:39.826 --> 00:13:41.376
I wondered if I wasn't blind...

00:13:41.376 --> 00:13:42.001
I'm leaving!

00:13:42.001 --> 00:13:43.266
I loathe myself.

00:13:50.426 --> 00:13:52.181
I wondered if I didn't have that accident,

00:13:53.627 --> 00:13:54.804
if I wasn't blind,

00:13:55.862 --> 00:13:57.396
would I still lose you?

00:14:01.029 --> 00:14:02.605
I just realized that

00:14:03.381 --> 00:14:04.280
"Oh,

00:14:05.268 --> 00:14:07.022
if I was normal,

00:14:08.221 --> 00:14:10.051
why would I need a helper?"

00:14:12.308 --> 00:14:13.905
"How could I meet you?"

00:14:19.513 --> 00:14:20.938
I miss you.

00:14:21.749 --> 00:14:22.983
Really miss you.

00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:27.461
I don't need us to get back together.

00:14:28.837 --> 00:14:30.777
I don't need you to tell me you love me like the first time. 

00:14:32.893 --> 00:14:34.749
I just want to know your name.

00:14:35.753 --> 00:14:37.458
I want you to call me the way you did.

00:14:39.574 --> 00:14:40.389
I told you.

00:14:40.889 --> 00:14:41.671
I am Phong.

00:14:42.553 --> 00:14:43.335
Not Phuc.

00:14:44.128 --> 00:14:45.097
You're still mistaking me.

00:14:48.589 --> 00:14:50.218
I only beg for one favor!

00:14:51.029 --> 00:14:52.474
Is it so hard to admit who you really are?

00:14:53.074 --> 00:14:54.425
Are you going to leave me again?

00:15:02.043 --> 00:15:03.906
Everything is still there.

00:15:04.858 --> 00:15:06.000
Someone has to leave.

00:15:06.705 --> 00:15:08.288
You can't force anyone to stay.

00:15:09.064 --> 00:15:10.295
If you still insist...

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.465
Your lover was a boy, right?

00:15:15.793 --> 00:15:18.474
I get why he chose to leave you.

00:15:20.361 --> 00:15:23.130
At first, we all thought that it was easy.

00:15:24.999 --> 00:15:25.959
Actually,

00:15:27.608 --> 00:15:29.751
no one would let our loved one lose a relationship

00:15:29.751 --> 00:15:31.419
because of us.

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.456
You and your boyfriend

00:15:33.456 --> 00:15:35.216
were in a relationship.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.302
But, you still had so many other relationships in life.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.959
You couldn't just lose them all!

00:15:43.604 --> 00:15:44.858
I hope you can understand.

00:15:46.904 --> 00:15:49.067
I could have tried to make everything work!

00:15:49.067 --> 00:15:50.652
At first, everything was great.

00:15:51.146 --> 00:15:54.000
But, pressure, denial,

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.658
everything was torn apart.

00:16:00.243 --> 00:16:01.478
You're not Phuc.

00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:02.611
Yes.

00:16:03.105 --> 00:16:03.903
I am Phong.

00:16:04.961 --> 00:16:06.598
I'm your temporary helper.

00:16:14.181 --> 00:16:15.939
You're not the one I'm looking for.

00:16:15.939 --> 00:16:17.526
 You mistook me.

00:16:23.099 --> 00:16:24.174
Sorry.

00:16:25.796 --> 00:16:26.703
I mistook you.

00:17:21.298 --> 00:17:26.769
Please help me handle it.

00:18:02.498 --> 00:18:04.308
I'm done. I'll go now.

00:18:04.308 --> 00:18:05.471
How many faces does one have?

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.269
Do you know that?

00:18:13.582 --> 00:18:15.775
It's hard to understand someone

00:18:16.445 --> 00:18:18.000
because they have so many faces.

00:18:19.209 --> 00:18:20.418
A face to the society.

00:18:21.547 --> 00:18:22.950
A face to their colleagues.

00:18:23.832 --> 00:18:25.236
A face to their friends and family.

00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:28.938
A face to themselves.

00:18:31.689 --> 00:18:33.457
Still, there was one who could get me.

00:18:38.289 --> 00:18:39.700
When I had that accident,

00:18:41.146 --> 00:18:42.204
I was all alone.

00:18:44.299 --> 00:18:47.734
I remembered it was a day in Spring 6 years ago.

00:18:50.556 --> 00:18:52.343
My ex-girlfriend brought me a helper.

00:18:54.491 --> 00:18:55.440
I didn't like to meet new people

00:18:55.757 --> 00:18:56.677
because...

00:18:57.806 --> 00:19:00.310
I was afraid that they could see my weaknesses.

00:19:01.897 --> 00:19:04.354
But, he saw what I was hiding.

00:19:08.093 --> 00:19:09.805
Things that no one else could see.

00:19:11.286 --> 00:19:12.422
Day after day,

00:19:13.273 --> 00:19:14.124
patiently,

00:19:14.829 --> 00:19:15.534
thoughtfully,

00:19:16.839 --> 00:19:18.000
he was by my side.

00:19:24.247 --> 00:19:26.396
I knew we couldn't stay together

00:19:27.877 --> 00:19:29.512
even though we were alike.

00:19:31.981 --> 00:19:33.127
Do you know why?

00:19:34.679 --> 00:19:36.067
Not everyone acts alike.

00:19:36.949 --> 00:19:39.082
Why were we alike?

00:19:43.279 --> 00:19:45.300
Because he did everything for me.

00:19:46.993 --> 00:19:48.598
All for me.

00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:52.385
We were both male.

00:19:55.912 --> 00:19:57.758
But he was so much stronger than me.

00:20:00.161 --> 00:20:02.564
He knew how to do things and took care of others.

00:20:06.902 --> 00:20:08.572
Just that

00:20:09.665 --> 00:20:12.225
wasn't enough to make me love him so much.

00:20:16.845 --> 00:20:18.542
He gave me peace.

00:20:21.293 --> 00:20:23.676
I didn't need to wear a fake smile

00:20:24.593 --> 00:20:27.118
or try to be tough or cold.

00:20:31.209 --> 00:20:32.981
I just needed to be myself.

00:20:37.143 --> 00:20:38.028
It's late. I should...

00:20:38.028 --> 00:20:39.510
You and he are so much alike

00:20:41.661 --> 00:20:42.916
in the way you get rude,

00:20:44.343 --> 00:20:46.482
hiccup or raise your tone with me.

00:20:51.208 --> 00:20:52.422
"Are you crazy?"

00:20:58.524 --> 00:21:00.103
"Why did you have to do this?"

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:06.368
"You want to get scolded?"

00:21:12.293 --> 00:21:13.521
That was the way

00:21:13.944 --> 00:21:17.612
he made me feel that he treated me sincerely.

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:24.000
Even your smell and your voice

00:21:25.799 --> 00:21:26.993
are similar to him.

00:21:29.779 --> 00:21:30.906
What a pity!

00:21:33.022 --> 00:21:33.901
You're Phong.

00:21:36.158 --> 00:21:37.120
Not Phuc.

00:21:43.363 --> 00:21:44.688
My mom passed away.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.015
No one's here to control me anymore.

00:21:54.953 --> 00:21:56.388
But I'm not happy.

00:22:01.643 --> 00:22:02.860
The day she was buried,

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:08.410
I didn't have a tear.

00:22:14.688 --> 00:22:16.524
Do you know how I lived?

00:22:19.099 --> 00:22:20.576
I lived a successful life.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.473
People welcome me.

00:22:26.282 --> 00:22:27.091
They all love me.

00:22:29.525 --> 00:22:32.127
They're willing to pay millions dongs to eat what I cook.

00:22:35.795 --> 00:22:37.389
But I feel so empty.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.717
I'll ask you one last time.

00:22:48.126 --> 00:22:49.273
What's your name?

00:22:51.918 --> 00:22:53.185
- Sorry... 
- I knew everything!

00:22:54.455 --> 00:22:55.831
Or you want me to say it?

00:22:56.395 --> 00:22:57.808
Take a look at this.

00:22:58.161 --> 00:22:59.173
What is this?

00:22:59.561 --> 00:23:00.965
Phuc's portfolio.

00:23:02.587 --> 00:23:03.681
How did you get it?

00:23:05.727 --> 00:23:07.847
6 years ago, I was the one who hired him.

00:23:07.847 --> 00:23:12.013
Therefore, I had his portfolio including his CV.

00:23:12.577 --> 00:23:14.196
Your mom told me to hid it from you.

00:23:14.725 --> 00:23:16.630
I buried it along with my love for you.

00:23:19.522 --> 00:23:20.680
I'm sorry.

00:23:23.572 --> 00:23:24.999
Why are you giving it to me now?

00:23:25.211 --> 00:23:27.448
I don't want to see you suffer.

00:23:28.153 --> 00:23:29.669
You haven't...

00:23:30.551 --> 00:23:32.803
seen Phuc's face, have you?

00:23:37.247 --> 00:23:38.444
Thach.

00:23:41.689 --> 00:23:44.193
From now on, live a happy life.

00:23:50.683 --> 00:23:53.521
I am Phong, not Phuc.

00:23:55.038 --> 00:23:57.771
Maybe we just look alike.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:03.791
Then tell me you hate me.

00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.329
Tell me that you don't love me!

00:25:12.018 --> 00:25:13.519
I'll ask you one last time.

00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.853
What's your name?

00:25:19.652 --> 00:25:20.430
Hi.

00:25:21.030 --> 00:25:24.459
I'm Thien Phuc. Nice to meet you.

00:27:28.685 --> 00:27:29.710
Babe.

00:27:33.272 --> 00:27:35.024
Come home with me on my mom's death anniversary.

00:27:35.553 --> 00:27:36.463
My aunts want to see you.
