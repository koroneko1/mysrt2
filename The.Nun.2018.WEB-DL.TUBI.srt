I've tried to find more information on the castle itself,

but there's no record of it in the village.

It's tradition here when someone dies.

553

You cover the mirror,

554
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,452
so the deceased doesn't see their reflection

555

Sister Oana,

601
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:32,295
can you tell me about the history of this abbey?

602
00:50:35,132 --> 00:50:37,634
It was built by a duke in the Dark Ages.

603
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,139
The Duke of Saint Carta.

604
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:45,742
He wrote countless texts on witchcraft and rituals,

605
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:48,979
in which to call upon the forces of hell.

606
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,782
Hell used him to open a gateway

607
00:50:51,848 --> 00:50:53,183
so that an unspeakable evil

608
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,818
would walk amongst us.

609
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:57,587
(RUMBLING)

610
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,735
But the Church stormed the castle.

611
00:51:16,773 --> 00:51:21,178
They sealed the gateway using an ancient relic

612
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:23,747
containing the blood of Jesus Christ.

613
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:30,487
The Church claimed the castle for their own

614
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:32,456
and our perpetual praying began

615
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:35,425
to secure the abbey and contain the evil.

616
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:40,297
For centuries it worked and evil was kept at bay

617
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:43,934
until the bombs of war shook the abbey

618
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:48,205
and evil found another way to open the gateway.

619
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:52,242
Sister Oana, last night in the chapel,

620
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,510
I saw a nun.

621
00:51:54,878 --> 00:52:00,150
She was-- She felt anything but holy.

622
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,486
Do you see her, too?

623
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,890
I've seen her stalking the hallways at night.

624
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,859
We all have.

625
00:52:08,925 --> 00:52:11,862
She looks like us, but she's not one of us.

626
00:52:11,928 --> 00:52:13,463
It's something unholy.

627
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,565
It takes on different forms to deceive us

628
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:17,167
and prey on our weaknesses.

629
00:52:17,234 --> 00:52:19,469
It appears as a nun so it can hide among our cloister

630
00:52:19,536 --> 00:52:21,705
until it can corrupt us all.

631
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:25,509
I fear her presence means the portal has opened again.

632
00:52:25,575 --> 00:52:27,844
It made Sister Victoria commit the ultimate sin.

633
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,246
SISTER ABIGAIL: Sister Oana.

634

No.

Yes?
