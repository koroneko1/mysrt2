1
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,708
What are you waiting for?

2
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,750
What kind of camera could kill people?

3
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,833
Do it!

4
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:28,750
Press the button!

5
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:31,750
Come on!

6
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,375
Press it!

7
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:28,833
Hello, professor.

8
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:30,291
Hello.

9
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:02,666
Let me ask you, Dan,

10
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:05,791
why did you choose me to be your advisor?

11
00:03:07,875 --> 00:03:09,458
I want to graduate with honors.

12
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,041
And you think this work…

13
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:14,416
will get you an honor?

14
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,250
It'd be embarrassing
just to let you graduate.

15
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,458
I don't work in a fashion magazine.

16
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,875
I select artists.

17
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,041
Anybody could take pictures like these.

18
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:38,583
Are you free on Sunday?

19
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:41,958
Yes.

20
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:44,708
Think of a new topic for your thesis,

21
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:49,041
and we can discuss it… at my place.

22
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:50,000
All right.

23
00:03:51,958 --> 00:03:53,125
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

24
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,375
How did it go, Dan?

25
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:19,708
Now you're stuck with Professor Aim.

26
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:23,458
With Professor Win,
you'd have graduated with us.

27
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:27,500
Well, he wants to be top of the class,

28
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:30,500
so he has to learn
from the best professor.

29
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,500
Right?

30
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,583
-Fifty-five seconds.
-Dan beat you, 40 seconds. Give it to me.

31
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,500
But it's okay. It's quick enough.

32
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,375
Enough to be the top-of-class
photographer's girlfriend.

33
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,166
Hey.

34
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,083
Are we together? Are we?

35
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,583
What? You guys are not together?

36
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:05,041
You hang out all the time.
I thought you were.

37
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:13,125
Or maybe he doesn't let you pass
because they're photos of me?

38
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:15,125
No. You're pretty.

39
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,000
Oh, my.

40
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:23,000
A guy thinks I'm pretty.

41
00:05:24,041 --> 00:05:25,541
Does he have a crush on me?

42
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:31,875
A customer.

43
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,291
Okay, I'll do it this evening.

44
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,583
Come on. One more.

45
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,458
-Let me see.
-Look at this.

46
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:20,875
What the hell?

47
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,000
Sushi!

48
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:35,416
-Is this your nephew's toy?
-What are you talking about?

49
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,083
Come on. Let me show you.

50
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,500
You're into photography for real? Look.

51
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:51,000
Hey.

52
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,500
Why is it only the two of us?

53
00:06:55,041 --> 00:06:56,416
-Should I be in there?
-Yes.

54
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,916
-All of us.
-I'll take it.

55
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:00,333
Go on.

56
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:07,500
One, two, three.

57
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,166
-On the other side.
-That side too?

58
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:12,208
Yeah. Come on.

59
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:15,375
Ready? One, two, three!

60
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,333
We're going to go to New York together.

61
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,916
You know I haven't graduated yet.

62
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:40,333
You haven't told him?

63
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:59,833
Well, Great and I got accepted.

64
00:08:02,625 --> 00:08:04,250
We need to be there next month.

65
00:08:22,291 --> 00:08:23,875
If I pass my project…

66
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,166
I'll get a scholarship to go too.

67
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,833
Hey.

68
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,583
Really?

69
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:38,083
We'll all go together.

70
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,625
For real?

71
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,791
You're serious?

72
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,916
I'll book you a ticket.

73
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,458
Damn, what's the rush?

74
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:51,208
Damn, dude!

75
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,583
What?

76
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:57,250
-Come on!
-New York!

77
00:08:58,458 --> 00:08:59,500
One, two, three!

78
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,791
Hello, Mom.

79
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,041
Your uncle's birthday is next Saturday.
Are you coming?

80
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:45,000
Well, you can give my best wishes to him.

81
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,416
You can't just not come.

82
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:50,833
We don't know how long he'll be with us.

83
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,000
Okay.

84
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,750
Besides, he paid for your tuition.

85
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,000
Your friends are all graduated.

86
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,333
Are you graduating this year?

87
00:10:55,791 --> 00:10:56,791
Are you Dan?

88
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,583
Yes.

89
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,000
Hello.

90
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,541
-Come with me.
-Yes.

91
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,750
Professor Aim talks about you a lot.

92
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,958
He said you have potential.

93
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,291
-You must be good.
-Thank you.

94
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:20,125
Normally, he doesn't let students
come to his house.

95
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:25,291
So you must be working hard.

96
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:45,458
Like it?

97
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,041
Yes.

98
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,416
-Hello.
-Hello.

99
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,541
Who painted this?

100
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,250
I did.

101
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:59,666
For the next month's faculty exhibition.

102
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,166
It was my graduation project
displayed at Tillman Gallery.

103
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:06,250
Tillman Gallery?

104
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:08,333
In…

105
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:09,250
New York.

106
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,541
You get excited when I mention New York.

107
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,791
All right. What's your topic?

108
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:30,958
Oh, okay.

109
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,375
My topic is "proof."

110
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:47,958
I want to tell stories of the underdogs
who want to prove something to the world.

111
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:50,916
Like myself.

112
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,625
I'm going to use this camera.

113
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,000
What's so special about it?

114
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:12,166
My mom bought it for me
when I was in Grade 8.

115
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:14,916
Nowadays,

116
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,625
I don't know why we still take photos

117
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:21,791
if it isn't for capturing moments
or good memories.

118
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,500
When I was studying in New York,

119
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,833
I focused on taking photos everyday.

120
00:13:28,583 --> 00:13:32,416
But at the end,
all of them are just ordinary.

121
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,291
Until one day, I got this camera.

122
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,208
I used this for my final project.

123
00:13:48,541 --> 00:13:50,333
Once our work is sought after,

124
00:13:51,583 --> 00:13:52,958
we can do whatever we want.

125
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,041
Try it.

126
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:26,958
Use it to take photos of seven people…

127
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,541
in the next 14 days.

128
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:39,708
Dan,

129
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,750
if you pass this project,

130
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:48,500
I promise I'll nominate you
for the New York scholarship.

131
00:14:58,125 --> 00:14:59,041
I have to go.

132
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:02,375
Dan.

133
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,458
Don't give up.

134
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:09,541
Those who got approved by Professor Aim
are highly accomplished.

135
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:11,125
Of course.

136
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:12,833
-Thanks.
-You can do it.

137
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,166
Good. Good time. Great job.

138
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,291
Dan, he's an amazing photographer.

139
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:52,083
All the photos
in the Humans In the City page are his.

140
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:56,333
-Who has the most potential for a gold?
-Bomb.

141
00:16:56,833 --> 00:16:58,708
He's a talented athlete,

142
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:02,041
and is the most experienced
in this competition.

143
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,208
We're hoping
for another gold medal from him.

144
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,291
How's it going, Dan? Are you done?

145
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:18,250
-Yes, one more shot.
-Hurry, so we can interview him.

146
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,708
-Okay, got it.
-All right. You can move now.

147
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:49,041
Sorry for bothering you guys. Thank you.

148
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:52,625
How's it going?

149
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:57,166
Everything seems fine.
I'll develop and send them to you.

150
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,833
Okay, can't wait to see them.

151
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,958
If they're bad, that's on you.

152
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:13,750
What is this?

153
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:15,375
Professor Aim gave it to me.

154
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:19,000
Nam.

155
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,250
Well…

156
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,083
Do you like my work?

157
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,250
I do like your work.

158
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,625
But I like you more.

159
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,625
-You like that I take nice photos?
-I like your looks.

160
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,583
I'll go develop the film.

161
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:57,791
-See you.
-Good luck.

162
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:00,041
Bye, Great.

163
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:01,916
See you later.

164
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,375
-And send me the photos.
-Yeah!

165
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,666
Roj, hello.

166
00:19:19,541 --> 00:19:21,666
Elite Shungite, the stone of life…

167
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,916
from Russia.

168
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:26,708
What can it do?

169
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:31,375
The previous owner told me
that this stone can capture souls.

170
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,583
-That's why it's black.
-Really?

171
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,583
Westerners use it to ward off demons.

172
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,500
This…

173
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,750
is good for young ladies.

174
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,958
White Rose Quartz,
the stone of forgiveness.

175
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,000
Yeah?

176
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,750
If someone's mad at you,

177
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,583
give them the rock,
and they won't be anymore.

178
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,750
-Is that true?
-Why would I lie to you?

179
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:02,416
How much?

180
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,458
-Are you sure?
-Yeah. How much?

181
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,291
What's this?

182
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:26,291
For you.

183
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,041
Are you hitting on me?

184
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:30,750
Am I allowed?

185
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,375
Great,

186
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,458
there's nothing between us.

187
00:20:43,916 --> 00:20:44,750
Nam…

188
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:49,000
I just want to apologize for what I did.
Is that okay?

189
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:53,916
Okay, to be honest,

190
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,916
I still love you.

191
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:07,291
I just want to know
if we can ever get back together.

192
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:11,041
Great, are you in a music video?

193
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:16,791
-Nam, I'm being serious. I said I'm sorry.
-Great.

194
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:22,916
Imagine if I messed around
with another man, told you I was drunk,

195
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,750
and gave you a bracelet saying I'm sorry.

196
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:28,875
Come on, Great.

197
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,625
Can you imagine?

198
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,333
Do you like Dan now?

199
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:56,750
Great, you can't be mad at me.

200
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,750
Just keep it. It's expensive.

201
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:21,625
Fine, I'll keep it.

202
00:22:43,208 --> 00:22:44,166
Hey, Bomb.

203
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes, coach.

204
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:51,041
You were a bit behind today.

205
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,291
Just work harder tomorrow.

206
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,291
I'm sorry, coach.

207
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,125
Hey, it's okay. Don't worry.
Get some rest.

208
00:23:01,125 --> 00:23:02,375
We'll try again tomorrow.

209
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:31,916
Go on.

210
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,125
Zoom in? Closer.

211
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:42,125
Try to capture
your subject's moment, okay?

212
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:45,541
-Hello.
-Hello.

213
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:50,625
Here.

214
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,291
Good.

215
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:17,166
You're on the right track.

216
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
It's like you're portraying his soul.

217
00:28:24,208 --> 00:28:25,041
More.

218
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,208
Bring me more.

219
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:51,333
And this is Taew Pad Thai,
which has been here for over 50 years.

220
00:28:51,916 --> 00:28:54,500
It is said to be number one in this area.

221
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:55,416
One with shrimp!

222
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:58,583
And the most famous restaurant.

223
00:29:00,166 --> 00:29:04,250
Where would we go?
We've been here for three generations.

224
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,250
And this is our home,

225
00:29:07,208 --> 00:29:08,625
our identity.

226
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,541
Taew Pad Thai Cinema.

227
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:15,958
Great food that we'd like you
to try yourself.

228
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,500
Okay, turn at a 45-degree angle
and look at the camera.

229
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,166
Give me a little smile.

230
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:30,916
Ready.

231
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,625
One, two…

232
00:29:33,875 --> 00:29:37,333
Please look this way,
follow my finger. Okay.

233
00:29:40,083 --> 00:29:42,458
Okay. One, two…

234
00:29:50,625 --> 00:29:51,458
Dan.

235
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,333
Dan.

236
00:29:57,083 --> 00:29:58,291
What's wrong?

237
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,416
Nothing.

238
00:30:05,916 --> 00:30:06,750
Dan.

239
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,791
I remember that Jan used this camera.

240
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:13,916
Jan, the one who…

241
00:30:14,791 --> 00:30:16,583
died from a heart attack?

242
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:18,875
Yeah.

243
00:30:22,833 --> 00:30:26,458
How did it end up with Professor Aim?

244
00:30:38,458 --> 00:30:39,416
Hello, Great.

245
00:30:43,541 --> 00:30:44,375
What?

246
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:51,666
Dan.

247
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,250
Bomb, the guy we interviewed,
committed suicide.

248
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,250
RISING WHEELCHAIR RACER
BOMB BANCHA HANGED HIMSELF

249
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:11,750
Don't you think
Bomb's suicide seems suspicious?

250
00:31:18,541 --> 00:31:19,375
How?

251
00:31:21,875 --> 00:31:24,958
Well, how should I say this?
He's disabled, right?

252
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,833
So imagine, how could he reach the beam?

253
00:31:32,458 --> 00:31:33,375
How?

254
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,000
I JUST WANT THIS TO BE OVER.

255
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:02,583
IF YOU HADN'T BEEN OBSESSED
WITH THE THESIS,

256
00:33:02,666 --> 00:33:04,916
WE'D STILL BE TOGETHER.

257
00:33:08,708 --> 00:33:11,125
RIN - OCTOBER 6TH.

258
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,208
Rin.

259
00:33:24,083 --> 00:33:25,166
It's Nam.

260
00:33:26,125 --> 00:33:28,000
Are you free tomorrow?

261
00:33:28,875 --> 00:33:30,916
I have some questions about Jan.

262
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:42,041
Dan.

263
00:33:43,375 --> 00:33:45,125
What are you studying?

264
00:33:45,833 --> 00:33:47,333
What is his major?

265
00:33:50,333 --> 00:33:51,416
Photography.

266
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,958
Photography? Just like you, Taew.

267
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,166
Started learning piano and then quit.

268
00:34:00,083 --> 00:34:01,291
You understand, right?

269
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's difficult.

270
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,041
You have to practice and be dedicated.

271
00:34:08,666 --> 00:34:12,500
But you didn't give it all, Taew.
That's why you failed.

272
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:18,375
You and your mother hold our family back.

273
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,208
To be the best, you have to give it all.

274
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,375
You need to practice.

275
00:34:34,750 --> 00:34:36,208
Okay, blow the candle.

276
00:34:40,208 --> 00:34:41,541
Let's take some photos.

277
00:34:41,625 --> 00:34:43,875
Come on, Dan. Stand next to me.

278
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:44,833
Don't.

279
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:49,958
Dan, take photos of me.
Let's see how good you are.

280
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:52,000
Go on.

281
00:34:53,666 --> 00:34:54,916
Let's get…

282
00:34:57,083 --> 00:34:58,750
Let me see if you look good, Dad.

283
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:28,708
Mom's not here.

284
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,250
Let me go get her.

285
00:36:19,791 --> 00:36:21,916
What your uncle said is true.

286
00:36:24,541 --> 00:36:26,291
If you want to succeed,

287
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:30,000
you have to dedicate
all of your time to it.

288
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,541
But you also need time
for other aspects of life.

289
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:46,166
Let me go see your uncle.

290
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,291
Excuse me, I'm here to pick up
Bomb's belongings.

291
00:38:59,125 --> 00:39:00,666
I'm sorry about what happened.

292
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:07,166
Athletes with high expectations
are always under pressure.

293
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:12,583
But I never thought
Bomb would kill himself.

294
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,541
Did he seem depressed or anything?

295
00:39:22,666 --> 00:39:24,916
Not that I know of.

296
00:39:26,291 --> 00:39:28,458
Bomb was very ambitious.

297
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:31,625
So much that his teammates
didn't like him.

298
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:35,375
I don't think
he would've made a decision like that.

299
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:23,291
Professor,

300
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:25,875
I wonder…

301
00:41:28,833 --> 00:41:32,000
if there's something about this camera?

302
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:33,958
I mean,

303
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:38,666
when I take photos with it, I see…

304
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:42,791
What do you see?

305
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,458
Are you stressed about the thesis?

306
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,250
The people I took photos of,

307
00:42:02,458 --> 00:42:03,583
one of them died.

308
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,250
And you know him?

309
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:15,416
No.

310
00:42:19,333 --> 00:42:20,250
So what?

311
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,458
We all die someday, Dan.

312
00:42:30,291 --> 00:42:35,041
The question is,
how are we living while we're still alive?

313
00:42:36,583 --> 00:42:37,791
How do you want to live?

314
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:51,666
I want to give it all.

315
00:43:01,291 --> 00:43:02,708
Take these photos for me,

316
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:05,583
and I will…

317
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:08,875
make the world accept you.

318
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:45,166
Where are you going?

319
00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:47,125
-What do you want?
-Nothing.

320
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,458
I haven't seen you for days,
so I stopped by.

321
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:51,083
Wait.

322
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:57,500
-We have a photoshoot today.
-I know.

323
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:01,333
I'm not coming. Will you cover for me?

324
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,833
-Yeah.
-Dan.

325
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:09,500
Are you going to use that camera again?

326
00:44:10,583 --> 00:44:11,416
Why?

327
00:44:15,166 --> 00:44:18,375
Well, it belongs to a dead person,

328
00:44:19,416 --> 00:44:21,000
and you still dare to use it?

329
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,541
We all die someday.

330
00:44:23,375 --> 00:44:24,875
It has nothing to do with it.

331
00:44:26,708 --> 00:44:28,125
Why are you being like this?

332
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:32,333
You never treat me like this.

333
00:44:36,208 --> 00:44:38,000
I'm here because I care about you.

334
00:44:47,458 --> 00:44:49,166
Here is Jan's notebook.

335
00:44:50,291 --> 00:44:52,375
Take a look and see what you can find.

336
00:44:56,166 --> 00:44:59,625
And, did Jan have symptoms like…

337
00:45:00,208 --> 00:45:02,916
feeling unwell or acting weird?

338
00:45:04,208 --> 00:45:05,250
She seemed sluggish…

339
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:11,833
and in poor health.

340
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:23,416
I told her to go see a doctor,
but she wouldn't.

341
00:45:26,875 --> 00:45:28,791
She was obsessed with her thesis.

342
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:59,250
Jan actually had a lot of energy,
and was very confident.

343
00:46:01,916 --> 00:46:03,541
But while working on her thesis,

344
00:46:04,916 --> 00:46:06,625
she looked totally consumed by it.

345
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:09,625
She wasn't the Jan I knew.

346
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:12,583
Ever since she got that camera.

347
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,291
Thank you.

348
00:46:35,041 --> 00:46:36,708
Don't you feel that nowadays,

349
00:46:36,791 --> 00:46:39,875
we only use photo apps
to take photos, edit…

350
00:46:39,958 --> 00:46:41,000
That is Porch.

351
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:42,291
…share, and follow others?

352
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:43,625
He graduated overseas.

353
00:46:45,416 --> 00:46:46,250
What's up?

354
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:48,708
He's the founder of this startup.

355
00:46:49,541 --> 00:46:52,916
Hard working. He's our funding source.

356
00:46:53,583 --> 00:46:54,541
All right. Come on.

357
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:58,125
Wouldn't it be better if we had
a more versatile application?

358
00:46:58,208 --> 00:47:01,708
Pic Me allows you to edit photos
as if they were taken with film…

359
00:47:01,791 --> 00:47:04,041
-She's Minnie.
-…without photo studios.

360
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:08,541
You can tell that she's important.
Her friends are all celebrities.

361
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:14,083
And when it comes to work, she's the best.

362
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,541
Can you reset the lighting?

363
00:47:20,416 --> 00:47:24,625
Our Rendez-Vous system allows everyone
to create appointments for photoshoots.

364
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:25,625
That guy is Ten.

365
00:47:26,708 --> 00:47:28,500
He's the brains of the team.

366
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:32,166
Whatever you want, he can make it happen.

367
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:36,458
With this, anybody can be
a professional photographer.

368
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:41,166
Rich people can do whatever they want.

369
00:47:43,583 --> 00:47:46,125
When you already have everything
in your hands,

370
00:47:49,333 --> 00:47:51,250
you don't have to fight for anything.

371
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,333
So what's the point of living?

372
00:48:32,666 --> 00:48:34,291
-Can I see another one?
-Sure.

373
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:38,125
-If that's all, I'm going to take off.
-Of course.

374
00:48:38,208 --> 00:48:39,916
-Thank you.
-Thanks so much. Bye.

375
00:48:40,458 --> 00:48:42,500
-You'll see the final version soon.
-Yes.

376
00:48:45,625 --> 00:48:47,041
Be right back.

377
00:48:51,625 --> 00:48:53,625
Is Dan off work?

378
00:48:54,166 --> 00:48:56,625
Yeah. He left right after he was done.

379
00:48:56,708 --> 00:48:59,000
He was acting weird today.

380
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:02,125
Which camera did he use?

381
00:49:02,875 --> 00:49:03,708
Our camera.

382
00:49:03,791 --> 00:49:06,375
No, I mean which one of them?

383
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:09,166
-Nutt.
-Yes?

384
00:49:09,250 --> 00:49:11,625
-Which camera did Dan use?
-Digital one.

385
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:14,166
He took the memory card
to get the photos tonight.

386
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:26,041
Let's go.

387
00:49:29,291 --> 00:49:30,375
Whose notebook is it?

388
00:49:31,083 --> 00:49:31,916
Jan's.

389
00:49:34,166 --> 00:49:35,208
The dead Jan?

390
00:49:36,041 --> 00:49:36,875
Yeah.

391
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,125
Is it possible that a camera
could kill someone?

392
00:49:40,625 --> 00:49:42,083
Could be a coincidence.

393
00:49:44,583 --> 00:49:48,375
Or Dan is a jinx.
Anyone he takes photos of dies.

394
00:49:49,416 --> 00:49:51,291
That's why you took Jan's notebook?

395
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:54,125
Come on.

396
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,583
-Nont.
-Yes?

397
00:50:07,666 --> 00:50:09,458
-Did Dan send the photos?
-Not yet.

398
00:50:10,083 --> 00:50:12,041
What? He's never late.

399
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:17,000
How are the photos?

400
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,833
No. No rush. Just wondering.

401
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:24,083
Okay. You're developing them?

402
00:50:24,666 --> 00:50:25,500
Okay.

403
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:30,416
Wait, develop them? Dan…

404
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,125
Developing what?

405
00:50:35,541 --> 00:50:37,875
He said Porch asked him to use
the film camera,

406
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:40,500
and he just developed them.

407
00:50:54,583 --> 00:50:56,208
But the three of them were just…

408
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:40,250
How could a camera make people die?

409
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:05,833
If we modify the codes,
it'll be easier for users.

410
00:52:06,625 --> 00:52:08,916
I'm tired. Let's take a break.

411
00:52:17,041 --> 00:52:18,041
Ten minutes?

412
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,291
Let's make it 15,

413
00:52:20,958 --> 00:52:22,833
just in case Porch goes for a smoke.

414
00:52:26,416 --> 00:52:28,000
What's with the shitty traffic?

415
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:24,208
What the hell?

416
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:55,041
Dan, we need to talk about that camera.

417
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,958
What about it?

418
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:01,083
Porch, Ten, Minnie,

419
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:04,000
they all jumped off the building and died.

420
00:55:08,458 --> 00:55:11,041
Both owners of the Pad Thai restaurant
died too.

421
00:55:12,333 --> 00:55:14,625
I think your camera is cursed.

422
00:55:14,708 --> 00:55:16,416
Are you're saying it kills people?

423
00:55:18,291 --> 00:55:19,541
I don't know, but…

424
00:55:20,375 --> 00:55:21,750
There's something about it.

425
00:55:24,250 --> 00:55:25,333
Dan,

426
00:55:26,166 --> 00:55:28,666
Jan used this camera and she died.

427
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,125
The three people
she took photos of died too.

428
00:55:40,750 --> 00:55:41,625
Yes, Mom.

429
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,375
What's wrong with him?

430
00:56:03,916 --> 00:56:06,375
Hey, what are you going to do
with my camera?

431
00:56:07,875 --> 00:56:11,500
I'm going to go ask
your professor about it.

432
00:56:11,583 --> 00:56:13,125
Nam!

433
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,416
Do you know
about the death of Jan and Milin?

434
00:56:44,791 --> 00:56:47,041
How did you get this camera?

435
00:56:49,041 --> 00:56:50,125
I let Jan use it.

436
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:52,583
It's mine.

437
00:56:54,041 --> 00:56:55,250
Did you know?

438
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,875
Dan used this camera on six people,
and all of them died.

439
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:04,666
Are you saying that it can kill people?

440
00:57:11,083 --> 00:57:11,916
Seriously?

441
00:57:16,541 --> 00:57:17,875
A camera that kills.

442
00:57:17,958 --> 00:57:20,541
A camera that kills anyone
it takes a photo of.

443
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:28,333
How about this? You…

444
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:30,500
take a picture of me.

445
00:57:30,583 --> 00:57:32,166
Come on. Give it a shot.

446
00:57:33,791 --> 00:57:34,625
And see…

447
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,416
if I die.

448
00:58:15,750 --> 00:58:16,708
Wait.

449
00:58:56,458 --> 00:58:57,708
Why aren't you taking it?

450
00:58:58,958 --> 00:59:00,791
The film ran out? One second.

451
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:08,041
Nam?

452
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:15,875
What's wrong?

453
00:59:22,208 --> 00:59:23,125
Are you all right?

454
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:32,041
Nam.

455
00:59:33,125 --> 00:59:33,958
Dan.

456
00:59:41,041 --> 00:59:41,875
Nam!

457
00:59:45,958 --> 00:59:48,541
-What happened, Nam?
-That painting on…

458
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:51,250
Dan!

459
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:53,708
Didn't you see it?

460
00:59:54,625 --> 00:59:55,458
No.

461
00:59:57,458 --> 00:59:58,291
No?

462
01:00:01,833 --> 01:00:02,833
That was…

463
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:07,208
No, you must've seen something.

464
01:00:11,208 --> 01:00:13,458
-We have to throw it away.
-Give it back.

465
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:14,958
Dan!

466
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,708
-Throw it away!
-That's enough, Nam!

467
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:31,208
-Dan?
-Dan!

468
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:47,708
Dan. Come in, your uncle's waiting.

469
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:53,666
He's in a coma.

470
01:00:55,041 --> 01:00:57,000
He might not make it through the night.

471
01:00:58,583 --> 01:00:59,666
Hurry up.

472
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,958
He asked about you, Dan.

473
01:01:12,041 --> 01:01:13,458
Say goodbye to him, okay?

474
01:01:35,166 --> 01:01:36,000
Uncle.

475
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:39,791
It's me, Dan.

476
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:48,458
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

477
01:01:50,958 --> 01:01:51,791
Dan.

478
01:01:57,083 --> 01:01:59,916
You only have only five days
to submit your work.

479
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:02,958
Just one more.

480
01:02:58,458 --> 01:03:00,500
-Uncle?
-Go find a doctor.

481
01:03:00,583 --> 01:03:01,708
Nurse!

482
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:04,375
-Doctor!
-Go find a doctor. Uncle!

483
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:07,833
Come on, find a doctor!

484
01:05:29,458 --> 01:05:32,458
NAM

485
01:06:39,708 --> 01:06:40,541
Dan.

486
01:06:47,916 --> 01:06:49,458
Dan, are you okay?

487
01:06:49,541 --> 01:06:51,291
How did you know I was here?

488
01:06:55,958 --> 01:06:58,458
What happened, Dan? Are you okay?

489
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:06,333
I've found something.

490
01:07:07,833 --> 01:07:08,666
I think…

491
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:10,958
it might belong to you.

492
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:13,708
Just one more!

493
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:58,333
CAKE: DAN, DO YOU DO MODEL PHOTOGRAPHY?
HOW MUCH DO YOU CHARGE?

494
01:09:09,125 --> 01:09:15,666
SLR: YES, I'LL DO IT FOR FREE.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

495
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:27,583
Hey, Dan. Am I here too early?

496
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:32,833
No, you're fine.

497
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,333
What should I do?

498
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:39,875
How do you want me to pose?

499
01:09:40,958 --> 01:09:41,833
However you like.

500
01:10:19,041 --> 01:10:19,958
Leave us now.

501
01:10:23,083 --> 01:10:25,333
-Excuse me?
-Leave.

502
01:10:29,041 --> 01:10:30,416
I'm not saying it again.

503
01:10:51,708 --> 01:10:52,875
Looking for a model?

504
01:10:57,125 --> 01:10:58,541
Take a photo of me then.

505
01:11:20,083 --> 01:11:21,250
What are you afraid of?

506
01:11:34,833 --> 01:11:35,750
Go on.

507
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:47,041
Well, there's nothing wrong
with this camera.

508
01:11:48,458 --> 01:11:50,375
What kind of camera could kill people?

509
01:11:56,833 --> 01:11:57,916
Press the button.

510
01:12:00,041 --> 01:12:01,250
Press it, Dan.

511
01:12:09,666 --> 01:12:10,666
Press it.

512
01:12:18,333 --> 01:12:19,458
Dan!

513
01:12:20,291 --> 01:12:22,750
Come on, do it!

514
01:12:29,541 --> 01:12:30,916
Press it!

515
01:12:40,625 --> 01:12:41,666
Fuck!

516
01:13:01,750 --> 01:13:05,458
Nam, I didn't mean to kill them.

517
01:13:06,333 --> 01:13:09,583
I didn't mean it.

518
01:13:10,416 --> 01:13:12,541
Nam…

519
01:13:43,416 --> 01:13:44,666
Everything will be okay.

520
01:13:46,458 --> 01:13:47,958
You'll always have us.

521
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,416
We're in this together.

522
01:14:01,708 --> 01:14:03,083
HOLE IN THE DARKNESS

523
01:14:03,166 --> 01:14:04,000
This…

524
01:14:04,666 --> 01:14:06,791
was the last website Jan visited.

525
01:14:12,250 --> 01:14:16,166
Is this… the painting we saw
at Professor Aim's house?

526
01:14:17,166 --> 01:14:18,000
Hey.

527
01:14:25,041 --> 01:14:25,875
What's wrong?

528
01:14:28,041 --> 01:14:29,208
Do you see him?

529
01:14:32,791 --> 01:14:33,625
Yes.

530
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:39,625
I took a picture of him.

531
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:44,916
Dan!

532
01:14:46,375 --> 01:14:47,500
-Hey.
-Wait.

533
01:14:56,458 --> 01:14:57,791
These two didn't die.

534
01:15:10,416 --> 01:15:11,291
The eyes.

535
01:15:11,375 --> 01:15:14,041
These are the only two
where you can't see their eyes.

536
01:15:16,375 --> 01:15:18,708
But we can see the eyes
of the people who died.

537
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:24,916
I think we need to find help.

538
01:15:32,375 --> 01:15:33,625
Demons…

539
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:36,416
always manifest in unexpected forms.

540
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:39,416
Haven't you heard

541
01:15:39,500 --> 01:15:43,375
that some people believe
cameras capture souls in them?

542
01:15:43,958 --> 01:15:46,750
That cameras are used to kill people,

543
01:15:47,458 --> 01:15:50,041
to sacrifice souls to demons.

544
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,458
Does this panting
have anything to do with this?

545
01:15:55,083 --> 01:15:58,041
Professor Aim is displaying this painting
at the exhibition.

546
01:15:58,791 --> 01:16:00,958
Do you believe in satanic cults?

547
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:05,208
During that time,
whoever owned this painting…

548
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,291
was the most powerful.

549
01:16:10,083 --> 01:16:13,500
It says here
seven souls must be sacrificed.

550
01:16:15,208 --> 01:16:16,666
If you come up short,

551
01:16:17,625 --> 01:16:20,000
you have to sacrifice your own soul.

552
01:16:20,083 --> 01:16:22,083
That means Dan has to die?

553
01:16:23,291 --> 01:16:24,916
Is there anything we can do?

554
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:28,541
Tomorrow's the day
that the gate in hell opens.

555
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:31,500
Demons will come for their sacrifices.

556
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:41,083
Here, this can protect you from demons.

557
01:16:41,791 --> 01:16:43,500
Wear it and don't take it off.

558
01:16:45,875 --> 01:16:48,666
Great, do you still have
the stone I gave you?

559
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:53,666
Hold onto it. It can protect you.

560
01:16:57,750 --> 01:17:00,083
This is all I can help you with.

561
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:01,958
Do whatever you have to, fast.

562
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,666
What if he's really a demon?

563
01:17:14,750 --> 01:17:16,708
How are we going to fight him?

564
01:17:22,875 --> 01:17:25,333
The inspiration that I have…

565
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:36,291
We'll give him
a taste of his own medicine.

566
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:04,750
Can you tell us where you got
the inspiration for this show?

567
01:18:05,458 --> 01:18:06,708
My mother.

568
01:18:06,791 --> 01:18:11,583
My mother came from a small family,
oppressed by her extended family,

569
01:18:11,666 --> 01:18:16,000
but my mother refused
to lose her identity as an artist.

570
01:18:17,875 --> 01:18:19,916
She did what she was good…

571
01:18:21,708 --> 01:18:22,875
I can't take the shot.

572
01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:26,041
Let me clear the path.

573
01:18:31,958 --> 01:18:33,083
This is my father.

574
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:57,083
Dan!

575
01:18:59,041 --> 01:19:00,583
Why don't you join us inside?

576
01:19:02,750 --> 01:19:04,000
I'll be right there.

577
01:19:05,083 --> 01:19:05,916
Okay.

578
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:16,083
Look at Great.

579
01:20:06,041 --> 01:20:08,458
It's very ambitious,

580
01:20:08,541 --> 01:20:11,583
and I can tell it's not difficult
to capture his soul.

581
01:20:12,250 --> 01:20:15,458
There are more photos
inside the exhibition.

582
01:20:16,041 --> 01:20:17,000
Please look around.

583
01:20:17,750 --> 01:20:18,708
I hope you enjoy.

584
01:20:40,583 --> 01:20:43,875
Shit! His eyes were closed.

585
01:20:47,708 --> 01:20:48,541
What's that?

586
01:20:57,416 --> 01:20:59,166
It's not very clear, is it?

587
01:21:39,916 --> 01:21:41,333
Help!

588
01:21:41,416 --> 01:21:44,333
Great! Great!

589
01:21:47,416 --> 01:21:50,625
I saw a big creature right on my face!

590
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:53,625
What is it?

591
01:21:58,333 --> 01:21:59,208
Great.

592
01:22:01,375 --> 01:22:02,541
Calm down.

593
01:22:02,625 --> 01:22:04,958
-Calm down.
-You've seen it before, right?

594
01:22:07,208 --> 01:22:08,375
Shit.

595
01:22:14,041 --> 01:22:16,500
Dan, you have less than an hour left.

596
01:22:18,375 --> 01:22:20,208
But Great is still alive.

597
01:22:22,916 --> 01:22:24,083
What does it mean?

598
01:22:25,666 --> 01:22:29,750
His eyes are clearly visible in the photo,
but he's not dead.

599
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:33,333
Does it mean there are other factors?

600
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:37,000
I think Roj's amulet is the real deal.

601
01:22:53,041 --> 01:22:54,541
Six people have already died.

602
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:06,291
Now, Great is going to be the seventh.

603
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:12,958
I won't let that happen.

604
01:23:46,541 --> 01:23:47,750
Dan, what are you doing?

605
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:54,416
You can't.

606
01:24:15,166 --> 01:24:16,583
I started this, Nam.

607
01:24:18,958 --> 01:24:20,291
I'll be the one to end it.

608
01:25:06,083 --> 01:25:07,250
Why are you doing this?

609
01:25:12,041 --> 01:25:13,708
Don't you want to go to New York?

610
01:25:24,958 --> 01:25:26,250
Why are you doing this?

611
01:25:27,958 --> 01:25:29,291
I'm submitting my project.

612
01:25:30,666 --> 01:25:32,333
It's just one more person.

613
01:25:35,833 --> 01:25:37,375
Let it be me.

614
01:25:39,625 --> 01:25:40,458
Do you know…

615
01:25:41,083 --> 01:25:43,000
what's going to happen if you do this?

616
01:25:46,583 --> 01:25:49,916
Everything you sacrificed for your dream…

617
01:25:52,541 --> 01:25:53,708
Don't be stupid, Dan.

618
01:25:54,708 --> 01:25:55,791
Just one more step.

619
01:25:57,916 --> 01:25:58,750
One more step.

620
01:25:59,500 --> 01:26:00,625
Yes.

621
01:26:01,666 --> 01:26:02,791
Just one more step.

622
01:26:05,166 --> 01:26:06,416
What are you waiting for?

623
01:26:15,541 --> 01:26:17,000
For you to get in the frame.

624
01:26:21,375 --> 01:26:22,291
Dan.

625
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:26,083
I'm so disappointed in you.

626
01:26:27,500 --> 01:26:28,375
What can you do?

627
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:47,958
Can you develop it in time?

628
01:26:48,625 --> 01:26:49,625
Catch me if you can.

629
01:27:14,166 --> 01:27:15,916
Hey, let's develop it.

630
01:27:32,458 --> 01:27:33,291
Shit.

631
01:28:25,916 --> 01:28:27,916
-Shit!
-Dan!

632
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:29,541
-Dan!
-Damn it.

633
01:28:29,625 --> 01:28:31,000
Let go of me! Let go!

634
01:28:33,333 --> 01:28:34,416
Nam, watch out!

635
01:28:38,750 --> 01:28:40,000
Dan, come on, get up.

636
01:28:53,875 --> 01:28:54,875
Nam, run!

637
01:28:55,916 --> 01:28:57,291
Get her out of here, Great.

638
01:29:24,250 --> 01:29:25,666
-Shit!
-Can't open it?

639
01:29:27,416 --> 01:29:28,291
God damn it!

640
01:31:37,125 --> 01:31:38,000
Is it gone?

641
01:31:38,750 --> 01:31:39,583
I don't know.

642
01:32:11,958 --> 01:32:13,375
Bitch!

643
01:32:46,250 --> 01:32:47,083
Great!

644
01:33:00,500 --> 01:33:02,625
Nam, run! Quick!

645
01:33:52,875 --> 01:33:53,708
Great!

646
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,500
Great, it's me!

647
01:33:58,375 --> 01:33:59,333
It's me.

648
01:34:02,083 --> 01:34:04,208
I'm sorry!

649
01:34:04,291 --> 01:34:06,916
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!

650
01:37:33,416 --> 01:37:34,833
Two minutes past midnight.

651
01:37:35,583 --> 01:37:36,666
Your time's up, Dan.

652
01:37:42,208 --> 01:37:44,666
But…I can help you.

653
01:37:46,791 --> 01:37:48,000
Just give me the film.

654
01:38:18,125 --> 01:38:19,125
Dan.

655
01:38:21,500 --> 01:38:23,250
What you're trying to do

656
01:38:23,375 --> 01:38:27,125
can't change the fact
that you've killed six people.

657
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:30,875
Just one more…

658
01:38:32,666 --> 01:38:34,916
to get what you want.

659
01:38:58,041 --> 01:38:59,208
That's right.

660
01:39:00,458 --> 01:39:01,833
Just one more…

661
01:39:07,750 --> 01:39:09,125
and it will be me.

662
01:40:08,500 --> 01:40:09,750
So heroic.

663
01:40:10,916 --> 01:40:12,041
So goddamn heroic.

664
01:40:15,041 --> 01:40:16,541
To sacrifice your own life?

665
01:40:17,666 --> 01:40:20,291
Dan, you are so brave.

666
01:40:22,750 --> 01:40:24,458
But do you think if you do this,

667
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:26,375
it will be over?

668
01:40:32,750 --> 01:40:35,750
You forgot about the people
who do everything to support you.

669
01:40:38,625 --> 01:40:39,458
Dan.

670
01:40:41,916 --> 01:40:43,666
I know you're different from me.

671
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:49,125
Don't let go of your dream.

672
01:40:49,750 --> 01:40:50,583
Dan.

673
01:40:53,625 --> 01:40:56,083
We made a promise
to go to New York together.

674
01:41:04,375 --> 01:41:05,208
Dan.

675
01:41:23,208 --> 01:41:24,666
Please do this for me…

676
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:30,625
so we can be together.

677
01:42:03,083 --> 01:42:04,458
You understand it now, Dan.

678
01:42:37,458 --> 01:42:39,041
You still don't get it, do you?

679
01:43:01,791 --> 01:43:04,416
Dan, you always surprise me,

680
01:43:05,833 --> 01:43:07,416
but your time is over.

681
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:53,291
Fuck!

682
01:45:16,375 --> 01:45:17,208
Shit!

683
01:45:18,916 --> 01:45:20,958
-Dan!
-Dan!

684
01:45:21,041 --> 01:45:23,291
-Dan, wake up! Dan!
-Dan!

685
01:45:24,125 --> 01:45:24,958
Dan, wake up!

686
01:45:32,541 --> 01:45:36,166
-Dan!
-Wake up, Dan!

687
01:45:38,083 --> 01:45:39,583
Dan!

688
01:45:45,625 --> 01:45:48,916
Shit, Dan! No, don't do this.

689
01:46:08,125 --> 01:46:09,000
Dan…

690
01:46:25,958 --> 01:46:26,833
Dan…

691
01:46:31,291 --> 01:46:33,416
We got his photo, Dan.

692
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:34,833
Dan!

693
01:46:38,500 --> 01:46:41,666
Sometimes, our dreams can be a burden.

694
01:46:49,375 --> 01:46:51,958
We just want to do what we love…

695
01:46:55,208 --> 01:46:59,708
because sometimes, life throws us
the unexpected and makes us distracted.

696
01:47:00,500 --> 01:47:02,458
Take good care of yourself in New York.

697
01:47:03,916 --> 01:47:05,000
I'll be fine.

698
01:47:14,583 --> 01:47:16,625
We weren't born equal.

699
01:47:19,166 --> 01:47:20,500
I'm glad I have you guys.

700
01:47:22,833 --> 01:47:25,375
We have to do the best
with what we're given.

701
01:47:25,458 --> 01:47:26,625
Damn it!

702
01:47:28,875 --> 01:47:30,291
I don't want this to happen…

703
01:47:37,291 --> 01:47:38,750
Dan…

704
01:47:40,666 --> 01:47:42,875
What's the meaning of its brand?

705
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:45,208
And we won't regret it,

706
01:47:47,958 --> 01:47:48,916
because…

707
01:47:50,541 --> 01:47:51,708
we gave it all for…

708
01:47:53,375 --> 01:47:54,208
our lives.

709
01:48:53,916 --> 01:48:55,791
Want me to look at the camera?
