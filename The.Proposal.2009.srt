- Yeah.

- Yeah.
- Me too.

37
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:19.173
Hello, Frank?
How's my favorite writer?

38
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:20.474
Of course you've been
thinking about our talk

39
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22.543
because you
know I'm right.

40
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24.478
Frank, people in this
country are busy, broke,

41
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26.180
and they hate to read.
They need someone
they can trust to say,

42
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29.183
"Hey! Don't watch
 CSI: Indianapolis tonight.

43
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31.919
Read a book! Read Frank's book."
And that person is Oprah.

[indistinct chatter]

45
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39.193

- One of those mornings.

Thank you,
Captain Obvious.

48

- Uh, sorry.
- ...Jesus!

49
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46.567
- [laughter]
- [man] Rub some dirt
on it, brother.

50
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:50.271
Frank, the truth is all
A-plus novelists do publicity.

51
00:02:51,272 --> 00:02:54.208
Roth, McCourt, Russo, and...

52
00:02:54,242 --> 00:02:56.844
Frank! Can I tell you what else
they have in common? A Pulitzer.

53
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:59.713
I need the shirt off
your back. Literally.

54
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:03.217
- You're kidding, right?
- Yankees, Boston, this Tuesday,

55
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:04.285
two company seats
for your shirt.

56
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:05.419
You have five
seconds to decide.

57
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:07.221
Five, four,
three, two, one.

- I know...

59
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:10.924
- Shh!
- Later.

Uh, hello. Hello?

64
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36.717
Morning, boss. You have a
conference call in 30 minutes.

65
00:03:36,917 --> 00:03:38.319
Yes. About the marketing
of the spring books. I know.

66
00:03:38,352 --> 00:03:40.254
Staff meeting
at 9:00.

67
00:03:40,288 --> 00:03:41.555
Did you call, um...
[groans] What's her name?

68
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:44.258
The one with
the ugly hands.

69
00:03:44,292 --> 00:03:44.925
- Janet.
- Yes, Janet.

70
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:46.827
Yes. I did call her.
I told her that

71
00:03:47,795 --> 00:03:48.529
if she doesn't get her
manuscript in on time

72
00:03:48,562 --> 00:03:49.430
you won't give her
a release date.

73
00:03:50,464 --> 00:03:50.731
Your immigration
lawyer called.

74
00:03:51,432 --> 00:03:51.765
He said that
it's imperative...

75
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54.034
Cancel the call, push
the meeting to tomorrow

76
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55.269
and keep the lawyer
on the sheets.

77
00:03:55,303 --> 00:03:56.770
Oh, and get
a hold of PR,

78
00:03:56,804 --> 00:03:57.905
have them start drafting
a press release.

79
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59.607
Frank is doing Oprah. 

80
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02.276
Wow. Nicely done.

81
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05.379
If I want your praise,
I will ask for it.

82
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09.350
Um...

83
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:10.951
Who is, uh,
who is Jillian?

84
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:13.587
And why does she
want me to call her?

85
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18.959
Well, that was
originally my cup.

86
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20.928
And I'm drinking
your coffee why?

87
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22.763
Because your
coffee spilled.

88
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:32.440
So, you drink unsweetened
cinnamon light soy lattes?

89
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:35.576
I do. It's like
Christmas in a cup.

90
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:37.445
Is that a
coincidence?

91
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:39.747
- Incredibly, it is.
- [phone ringing]

92
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41.682
I mean I wouldn't possibly drink
the same coffee that you drink

93
00:04:41,715 --> 00:04:43.384
just in case
yours spilled.

94
00:04:43,417 --> 00:04:45.453
That would
be pathetic.

95
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:47.087
Morning.
Miss Tate's office.

96
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48.389
Hey, Bob.

97
00:04:50,624 --> 00:04:53.594
Actually, we're headed to
your office right now. Yeah.

98
00:04:53,627 --> 00:04:56.330
Why are we headed
to Bob's office?

99
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:58.599
- [tsks]
- [tsks]

100
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00.568
[tsks]

101
00:05:06,006 --> 00:05:07.708
- [popping sound]
- [multiple pops]

102
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:08.709
[gasps] Oop!

103
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:13.681
Have you finished the
manuscript I gave you?

104
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:16.450
Uh, I read a few pages.
I wasn't that impressed.

105
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:17.918
- Can I say something?
- No.

106
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:20.020
I've read thousands
of manuscripts,

107
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21.389
and this is the only one
I've ever given you.

108
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23.491
There's an incredible
novel in there.

109
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:25.092
The kind of novel
you used to publish.

110
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28.662
Uh, wrong. And I do think you
order the same coffee as I do

111
00:05:28,696 --> 00:05:30.998
just in case you spill,
which is, in fact, pathetic.

112
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:32.099
- Or impressive.
- I'd be impressed

113
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:33.567
if you didn't spill
in the first place.

114
00:05:34,502 --> 00:05:34.768
Now remember, you're
just a prop in here.

115
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36.704
- Won't say a word.
- [clears throat]

116
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:44.478
Ah! Our fearless leader and
her liege. Please, do come in.

117
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:48.081
Oh. Beautiful breakfront.
Is it new?

118
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:51.151
It is English Regency Egyptian
Revival, built in the 1800s

119
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:53.854
but, yes, it is new
to my office.

120
00:05:53,887 --> 00:05:55.623
Witty.

121
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58.459
Bob, I'm letting you go.

122
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:02.963
Pardon?

123
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:04.064
I asked you over
a dozen times

124
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:04.865
to get Frank
to do Oprah, 

125
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:05.899
and you didn't do it.

126
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:08.068
[Tate] You're fired.

127
00:06:10,137 --> 00:06:12.039
I have told you
that is impossible.

128
00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:14.542
Frank hasn't done an
interview in 20 years.

129
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:16.109
[Tate] Well that is
interesting, because I just

130
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:18.412
got off the phone
with him, and he is in.

131
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21.449
Excuse me?

132
00:06:21,482 --> 00:06:22.416
You didn't even
call him, did you?

133
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25.886
- But...
- I know, I know.

134
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29.056
Frank can be a little scary
to deal with. For you.

135
00:06:29,089 --> 00:06:32.560
Now, I will give you two
months to find another job.

136
00:06:32,593 --> 00:06:34.595
And then you can tell
everyone you resigned, OK?

137
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40.968
What's his twenty?

138
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:44.605
He's moving.
He has crazy eyes.

139
00:06:44,638 --> 00:06:46.740
Don't do it, Bob.
Don't do it.

140
00:06:46,774 --> 00:06:50.878
- You poisonous bitch!
- [all gasp]

141
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52.713
You can't fire me!

142
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54.948
[Bob] You don't think I see
what you're doing here?

143
00:06:54,982 --> 00:06:56.884
Sandbagging me
on this Oprah thing

144
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58.719
just so that you can
look good to the board?

145
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01.722
Because you are
threatened by me!

146
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:04.558
- And you are a monster.
- Bob, stop.

147
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:07.961
It's just because you have
no semblance of a life

148
00:07:07,995 --> 00:07:09.797
outside of
this office.

149
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11.899
You think that you
can treat all of us

150
00:07:11,932 --> 00:07:13.567
like your own
personal slaves.

151
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:16.169
You know what?
I feel sorry for you.

152
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18.706
Because you know what you're
gonna have on your deathbed?

153
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20.841
Nothing and no one.

154
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:25.913
[breathes deeply]

155
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27.515
Listen carefully, Bob.

156
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:31.084
I didn't fire you because
I feel threatened. No.

157
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:34.588
I fired you because you're
lazy, entitled, incompetent

158
00:07:34,622 --> 00:07:36.089
and you spend more time
cheating on your wife

159
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37.658
than you do
in your office.

160
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38.959
And if you say
another word,

161
00:07:40,127 --> 00:07:41.629
Andrew here is gonna have you
thrown out on your ass, OK?

162
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:43.864
Another word and you're
going out of here

163
00:07:43,897 --> 00:07:45.633
with an armed escort.

164
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47.200
Andrew will film it with
his little camera phone

165
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:48.769
and he will put it
on that Internet site.

166
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:49.570
- What was it?
- YouTube?

167
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52.540
Exactly. Is that
what you want?

168
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:54.007
Didn't think so.
I have work to do.

169
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56.677
[all murmuring]

170
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58.612
Have security take his
breakfront out of his office.

171
00:07:58,646 --> 00:07:59.647
and put it in my
conference room.

172
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00.714
Will do.

173
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:01.749
And I need you
around this weekend

174
00:08:02,683 --> 00:08:03.617
to help review his files
and his manuscript.

175
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:05.586
- This weekend?
- You have a problem with that?

176
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:08.055
No. I... just my
grandmother's 90th birthday,

177
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09.557
so I was gonna
go home and...

178
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:11.692
...it's fine.
I'll cancel it.

179
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:13.160
You're actually saving me from
a weekend of misery anyway,

180
00:08:13,193 --> 00:08:15.729
so it's...
good talk, yeah.

181
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:20.801
I know, I know. OK, tell
Gammy I'm sorry. OK? What...

182
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22.603
Mom. What do you
want me to tell you?

183
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:24.805
She's making me
work the weekend.

184
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:25.839
No, I'm not... no.

185
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28.709
Listen, I've worked too
hard for this promotion

186
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:28.776
to throw it
all away, OK?

187
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30.210
I'm sure that
Dad is pissed,

188
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:31.745
but we take all
of our submissions

189
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33.113
around here
very seriously.

190
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:36.750
and will get back to
you as soon as we can.

191
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38.852
- Was that your family?
- Yes.

192
00:08:38,886 --> 00:08:40.688
- They tell you to quit?
- Every single day.

193
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:43.724
Miss Tate's office.

194
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:46.760
Oh... Yeah.
OK. All right.

195
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48.762
Bergen and Malloy want to
see you upstairs immediately.

196
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:51.231
[groans] OK. Come get me in ten
minutes. We've got a lot to do.

197
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:52.633
Okey-doke.

198
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:55.603
[phone ringing]

199
00:08:58,071 --> 00:08:59.607
Good morning, Miss Tate.

200
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:04.011
Jack, Edwin.

201
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:05.879
Margaret, congratulations
on the Oprah thing.

202
00:09:06,113 --> 00:09:07.648
- That's terrific news.
- Thank you, thank you.

203
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:10.618
This isn't about my second
raise, is it? [chuckles]

204
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:14.722
Margaret, do you
remember when we agreed

205
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16.657
that you wouldn't go to
the Frankfurt Book Fair

206
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17.758
because you weren't allowed
out of the country

207
00:09:18,826 --> 00:09:19.793
while your visa application
was being processed?

208
00:09:19,827 --> 00:09:20.761
Yes. I do.

209
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:23.130
And... you went
to Frankfurt.

210
00:09:23,163 --> 00:09:25.599
Yes, I did. We were going
to lose DeLillo to Viking.

211
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27.735
So... really didn't
have a choice, did I?

212
00:09:27,768 --> 00:09:28.669
It seems that the
United States Government

213
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31.138
doesn't care much who
publishes Don DeLillo.

214
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:33.774
We, uh, just spoke to
your immigration attorney.

215
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:36.644
Great. So, we're all
good? Everything good?

216
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38.946
Margaret, your visa
application has been denied.

217
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:41.815
- [stammers]
- And you are being deported.

218
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43.651
Deported?

219
00:09:43,684 --> 00:09:45.018
And apparently there
was also some paperwork

220
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46.620
that you didn't
fill out in time.

221
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:50.924
Come on. Come on! It's not
like I'm even an immigrant!

222
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52.760
I'm from Canada,
for Christ's sake.

223
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:55.462
There's gotta be... there's
gotta be something we can do.

224
00:09:55,495 --> 00:09:57.097
We can reapply,
but unfortunately

225
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58.666
you have to
leave the country

226
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00.167
for at least
a year.

227
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:07.808
OK. OK, well, that's
not ideal, but, uh..,

228
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:09.710
I can, uh... I can manage
everything from Toronto...

229
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11.812
- [Bergen] No, Margaret.
- ...with videoconferencing
and Internet.

230
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:12.846
[Malloy]
Unfortunately, Margaret,

231
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:13.681
if you're deported,

232
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:15.716
you can't work for
an American company.

233
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:17.718
Until this is resolved I'm
going to turn operations over

234
00:10:18,218 --> 00:10:19.119
to Bob Spaulding.

235
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:21.989
Bob Spaulding?
The guy I just fired?

236
00:10:22,022 --> 00:10:23.190
We need an
editor in chief.

237
00:10:24,825 --> 00:10:25.492
He is the only person
in the building

238
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:25.893
who has enough
experience.

239
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27.761
- You cannot be serious.
I beg of you.
- Margaret.

240
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29.997
We are desperate
to have you stay.

241
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32.833
If there was any way,
any way at all

242
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34.134
that we could make this
thing work, we'd be doing it.

243
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:36.403
- [knocking]
- There is no way...
I am begging you.

244
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38.138
No, Margaret. Excuse me,
we're in a meeting.

245
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:39.807
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What? What!

246
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42.309
Mary from Miss Winfrey's office
called. She's on the line.

247
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43.176
- I know.
- [Andrew] She's on hold.

248
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:45.045
She needs to speak
with you right away.

249
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46.479
I told her you were
otherwise engaged.

250
00:10:46,513 --> 00:10:48.849
She insisted,
so... sorry.

251
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:50.751
So...

252
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:02.730
Uh... [mouthing]

253
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05.432
[whispering]
Come here.

254
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:11.772
Uh... Gentlemen, I understand.
I understand...

255
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:14.708
the predicament
that we are in.

256
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:16.076
And, um...

257
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20.748
And there's,
uh... well...

258
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:23.050
I think there's something
that you should know.

259
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:27.855
Uh... we're, uh...
we're getting married.

260
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:29.923
We are getting married.

261
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:31.825
- Who is getting married?
- You and I.

262
00:11:31,859 --> 00:11:34.762
You and I are
getting married! Yes.

263
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:36.463
- We are.
- Getting married.

264
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:37.430
- [mumbling] We are
getting married.
- Yes.

265
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41.735
Isn't he
your secretary?

266
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:46.206
- Assistant.
- Executive, uh... assistant
secretary. Titles.

267
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:47.941
But, wouldn't
be the first time

268
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50.443
one of us fell
for our secretaries.

269
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52.780
Would it, Edwin?

270
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:55.048
[Tate] With Laquisha.
Remember?

271
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:58.786
So, yeah...
The truth is.

272
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:02.756
you know, Andrew and I we're...
we are just two people

273
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:04.925
who weren't meant to
fall in love but we did.

274
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06.827
No.

275
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:11.198
All those late nights at the
office and weekend book fairs.

276
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12.933
- Yeah...
- No.

277
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:15.068
- Something happened.
- Something.

278
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:18.138
Yeah. Tried to
fight it and...

279
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20.073
Can't, can't fight a...

280
00:12:20,107 --> 00:12:24.778
Can't fight a love
like ours, so, uh...

281
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:28.048
Uh... Are we good
with this? Are you happy?

282
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:31.885
Because, well...
we are happy. So happy.

283
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:32.886
- [Bergen] Margaret.
- Yes?

284
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34.888
It's terrific.

285
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:36.957
Just make it
legal. Mmm?

286
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39.459
Oh! Legal. [chuckles]

287
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:42.830
Yeah, well, then...
then that means we...

288
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:44.965
...we need to get ourselves
to the immigration office.

289
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:47.835
So we can work this
whole mess out. Right?

290
00:12:47,868 --> 00:12:49.837
[Tate] Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

291
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50.770
We will do that
right away.

292
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:53.006
Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you.

293
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55.242
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

294
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:58.078
[popping]

295
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59.947
[woman whispers] Margaret and
Andrew are getting married!

296
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01.481
[woman 2] What is that about?

297
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03.483
[man whispering] Dragon Lady!
Here they come...

298
00:13:03,516 --> 00:13:04.952
[snickering] Yeah.

299
00:13:04,985 --> 00:13:06.887
[woman 3] What is he thinking?

300
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:07.955
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

301
00:13:07,988 --> 00:13:09.990
[indistinct chatter]

302
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:12.860
Dude, for real.
Her? [laughing]

303
00:13:12,893 --> 00:13:14.061
[woman 4] Married? Didn't
even know they were dating...

304
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22.836
[Tate clears throat]

305
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:35.182
[clearing throat]

306
00:13:36,884 --> 00:13:37.417
What?

307
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41.054
I don't understand
what's happening.

308
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:42.923
[Tate] Relax.
This is for you, too.

309
00:13:42,956 --> 00:13:44.491
Do explain.

310
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46.894
They were going
to make Bob chief.

311
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:48.228
So naturally I would
have to marry you.

312
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:50.230
[Tate] And what's
the problem?

313
00:13:50,263 --> 00:13:52.632
Like you were saving yourself
for someone special?

314
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:56.003
I like to think so.
Besides, it's illegal.

315
00:13:56,036 --> 00:13:59.006
They're looking for terrorists,
not for book publishers.

316
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00.540
- Margaret.
- Yes?

317
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:03.410
- I'm not gonna marry you.
- Sure you are.

318
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:04.511
Because if you
don't marry me,

319
00:14:06,046 --> 00:14:06.079
your dreams of touching
the lives of millions

320
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08.048
with the written word
are dead.

321
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16.924
Bob is gonna fire you the
second I'm gone. Guaranteed.

322
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:19.026
That means you're out on the
street alone looking for a job.

323
00:14:19,559 --> 00:14:21.661
That means all the time that we
spent together, all the lattes,

324
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24.097
all the canceled dates,
all the midnight Tampax runs,

325
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:26.900
were all for nothing and
all your dreams of being
an editor are gone.

326
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:29.569
But don't worry, after the
required allotment of time,

327
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:31.004
we'll get a quickie divorce
and you'll be done with me.

328
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:32.940
But until then,
like it or not,

329
00:14:32,973 --> 00:14:34.908
your wagon is hitched
to mine. OK?

330
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:36.944
- [phone ringing]
- Phone.

331
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46.987
[indistinct chatter]

332
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:53.060
- This way.
- Margaret.

333
00:14:53,093 --> 00:14:55.062
- [hisses] Come.
- The line...

334
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:56.063
Next, please.

335
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57.931
Ooh, ooh. Just, uh...

336
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59.132
Sorry, I just need to
ask him something.

337
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01.901
I need for you to file this
fiancée visa for me, please.

338
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05.005
[scoffs]

339
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08.976
- Miss Tate?
- Yes.

340
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:11.544
Please,
come with me.

341
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:13.981
[woman] Yes ma'am, I understand
that. We're backed up...

342
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16.984
I have a bad feeling
about this.

343
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:18.118
[knocking]

344
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22.089
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

345
00:15:22,122 --> 00:15:25.025
Hi.
I'm Mr. Gilbertson.

346
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:26.960
- Ah!
- And you must be Andrew,

347
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28.428
- and you must be...
- Margaret.

348
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:29.963
...Margaret.
Sorry about the wait.

349
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31.999
It's a, uh,
crazy day today.

350
00:15:32,032 --> 00:15:33.967
Oh, of course, of course.
We understand.

351
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:36.003
And I can't tell you how much
we appreciate you seeing us

352
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:40.240
- on such short notice.
- OK. [sighs]

353
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:42.976
 * Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh 
 buh, buh, buh, buuuh * 

354
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44.611
So, I have one
question for you.

355
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:48.148
Are you both committing fraud
to avoid her deportation

356
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:52.085
so she can keep her position as
editor in chief at Colden Books?

357
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55.688
- That's ridiculous.
- Where did you hear that?

358
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:58.091
We had a phone tip this
afternoon from a man named...

359
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00.060
Would it be
Bob Spaulding?

360
00:16:00,093 --> 00:16:01.161
Bob Spaulding.

361
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04.531
Bob. Poor Bob.
I am so sorry.

362
00:16:04,564 --> 00:16:08.501
Bob is nothing but a
disgruntled former employee.

363
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09.702
And I apologize.

364
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:12.539
But we know you're
incredibly busy

365
00:16:12,572 --> 00:16:16.509
with a room full of gardeners
and delivery boys to tend to.

366
00:16:16,543 --> 00:16:18.611
If you just give us
our next step,

367
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:19.712
we will be out of your
hair and on our way.

368
00:16:21,081 --> 00:16:22.082
Miss Tate, please.

369
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:28.188
Let me explain to you the
process that's about to unfold.

370
00:16:28,221 --> 00:16:31.558
Step one will be
a scheduled interview.

371
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:33.226
I'll put you each
in a room,

372
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35.495
and I'll ask you
every little question

373
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:37.097
that a real couple
would know about each other.

374
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41.534
Step two, I dig deeper.
I look at your phone records,

375
00:16:41,568 --> 00:16:43.703
I talk to your neighbors,
I interview your coworkers.

376
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:46.173
If your answers don't
match up at every point,

377
00:16:46,206 --> 00:16:49.076
you will be deported
indefinitely.

378
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51.178
And you, young man, will have
committed a felony...

379
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53.080
[woman shouting in Spanish]

380
00:16:53,113 --> 00:16:54.714
...punishable by
a fine of $250,000

381
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57.517
and a stay of five years

382
00:16:57,550 --> 00:17:00.720
in federal prison.

383
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06.059
[Gilbertson] So, Andrew.

384
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:09.462
You wanna... you want
to talk to me?

385
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15.168
No?

386
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:19.139
Yes?

387
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:24.744
The truth is.

388
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:28.215
[Andrew clears throat]

389
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:32.852
Mr. Gilbertson,
the truth is...

390
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34.454
Margaret and I...

391
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:39.526
...are just two people

392
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:42.162
who weren't supposed
to fall in love.

393
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:44.831
[Andrew] But did.

394
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49.236
We couldn't tell
anyone we work with

395
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:51.738
because of my big promotion
that I had coming up.

396
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53.173
- [Gilbertson] Promotion?
- Yeah.

397
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57.244
- Your...?
- We, we both felt, uh...

398
00:17:57,277 --> 00:17:59.179
...that it would be
deeply inappropriate

399
00:17:59,212 --> 00:18:01.548
if I were to be
promoted to editor.

400
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03.850
- Editor. Mmm-hmm.
- ...while we were...

401
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:08.255
So...
[clears throat]

402
00:18:08,288 --> 00:18:09.489
Have the two of you
told your parents

403
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:11.124
about your
secret love?

404
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:14.561
Oh, I... impossible.
My parents are dead.

405
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16.729
- No brothers or sisters either.
- Gone.

406
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19.132
Are your parents dead?

407
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21.468
- Oh, no, his
are very much alive.
- No... very much.

408
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24.904
Very much. They're, ah...
Well, we were gonna tell
them this weekend.

409
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28.741
Gammy's 90th birthday, and the
whole family's coming together.

410
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30.443
And we thought it'd
be a nice surprise.

411
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:32.111
[Gilbertson] And where is this
surprise gonna take place?

412
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34.481
At Andrew's
parents' house.

413
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:35.782
Where is that
located again?

414
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:38.318
Umm... [scoffs] Why am I
doing all the talking?

415
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39.786
It's your
parents' house.

416
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41.154
Why don't you tell him
where it is. Jump in.

417
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45.258
- Sitka.
- Sitka.

418
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:47.427
- Alaska.
- Alaska?

419
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49.128
You're gonna go to
Alaska this weekend?

420
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:53.233
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

421
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:56.536
We are going to Alaska.
Alaska, that's where...

422
00:18:56,569 --> 00:18:59.138
That's where my little...
that's where my Andrew's from.

423
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:02.342
[Gilbertson] OK.

424
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:05.712
Fine. I see how
this is gonna go.

425
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08.648
I will see you both
at 11:00 Monday morning

426
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:10.683
for your
scheduled interview

427
00:19:10,717 --> 00:19:13.820
and your answers better
match up on every account.

428
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:16.723
- Thank you.
- Hello?

429
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:17.557
I'm looking forward
to this one.

430
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:18.958
We're looking forward
to this one.

431
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20.193
Thank you.

432
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22.695
Gonna be fun. I'll be
checking up on you.

433
00:19:22,895 --> 00:19:23.763
You got it.

434
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:33.340
OK... so, what's gonna happen
is we will go up there.

435
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:35.208
We will pretend like we're
boyfriend and girlfriend,

436
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36.809
tell your parents
we're engaged.

437
00:19:36,843 --> 00:19:38.678
Uh, use the miles
for the tickets.

438
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:41.248
I guess I will pop for
you to fly first class.

439
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42.282
But make sure
you use the miles.

440
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:43.283
If we don't get the miles,
we're not doing it.

441
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45.184
Oh, and please confirm
the vegan meal, OK?

442
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:47.520
'Cause last time they
actually gave it to a vegan,

443
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:49.422
and they, uh...
forced me to eat

444
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52.259
this clammy, warm, creamy
salad thing, which was...

445
00:19:52,292 --> 00:19:53.860
Hey, I'm... Why aren't
you taking notes?

446
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55.928
I'm sorry, were you
not in that room?

447
00:19:55,962 --> 00:19:57.430
What? What?

448
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01.501
Oh! The thing you said
about being promoted?

449
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:03.436
Genius! Genius. He
completely fell for it.

450
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:04.904
I was serious.

451
00:20:05,305 --> 00:20:07.674
I'm looking at a $250,000 fine
and five years in jail.

452
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08.975
That changes things.

453
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12.612
Promote you to editor?
No, no way.

454
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:14.247
Then I quit, and you're
screwed. Bye-bye, Margaret.

455
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:15.582
- Andrew!
- It really has been

456
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:20.420
- a little slice of heaven.
- Andrew, Andrew! Fine, fine.

457
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:22.555
I'll make you
editor. Fine.

458
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:26.259
If you do the Alaska weekend
and the immigration interview

459
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:28.961
I will make you
editor. Happy?

460
00:20:28,995 --> 00:20:31.398
- And not in two
years. Right away.
- Fine.

461
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32.765
And you'll publish
my manuscript.

462
00:20:34,767 --> 00:20:36.336
Ten thousand copy
first...

463
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:37.904
Twenty thousand copies,
first run.

464
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:39.572
And we'll tell my family
about our engagement

465
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41.408
when I want
and how I want.

466
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:43.610
Now, ask me nicely.

467
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:45.278
"Ask you nicely" what?

468
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:48.448
Ask me nicely to
marry you, Margaret.

469
00:20:50,783 --> 00:20:53.620
- What does that mean?
- You heard me. On your knee.

470
00:21:02,662 --> 00:21:03.696
Fine.

471
00:21:05,865 --> 00:21:07.667
[honking]

472
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14.641
- Does this work for you?
- Oh, I like this. Yeah.

473
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:16.909
- Will you marry me?
- No.

474
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:18.445
Say it like
you mean it.

475
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:20.447
[clears throat]

476
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:24.451
- Andrew?
- Yes, Margaret?

477
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27.654
- Sweet Andrew?
- I'm listening.

478
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:30.390
Would you please, with
cherries on top, marry me?

479
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35.862
OK. I don't appreciate
the sarcasm, but I'll do it.

480
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:38.498
- See you at the
airport tomorrow.
- Good.

481
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:54.981
So, these are the questions
that INS is gonna ask us.

482
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58.050
Now, the good news is is
I know everything about you,

483
00:21:58,084 --> 00:21:59.852
but the bad news is
that you have four days

484
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:00.987
to learn all
this about me.

485
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:04.691
So, you should...
probably get studying.

486
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10.497
You know all the answers
to these questions about me?

487
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12.565
- Scary, isn't it?
- [Tate] A little bit.

488
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:14.967
- What am I allergic to?
- Pine nuts.

489
00:22:15,001 --> 00:22:16.869
And the full spectrum
of human emotion.

490
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:19.005
Oh, that's... that
was funny. [chuckles]

491
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20.740
- Mmm-hmm.
- Ummm...

492
00:22:20,773 --> 00:22:23.576
Here's a good one.
Do I have any scars?

493
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25.678
I'm pretty sure
that you have a tattoo.

494
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:27.547
Oh, you're pretty sure?

495
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:29.716
I'm pretty sure. Two years ago,
your dermatologist called

496
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31.718
and asked about a
Q-switched laser.

497
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33.085
I of course Googled
a Q-switched laser

498
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35.555
and found that they
in fact do remove tattoos.

499
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37.089
But you canceled
your appointment.

500
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:40.159
So what is it?
Tribal ink?

501
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:42.695
Japanese calligraphy?
Barbed wire?

502
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:45.432
You know, it's exciting for me
to experience you like this.

503
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:47.567
Thank you. You're gonna have to
tell me where it is, though.

504
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49.101
- No, I'm not.
- They're gonna ask.

505
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51.704
We're done with that question.
We're done with that question.

506
00:22:51,738 --> 00:22:53.906
On to another question.
Let me see, let me see.

507
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56.776
Oh, here's one. Whose place
do we stay at, yours or mine?

508
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58.110
That's easy. Mine.

509
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:00.046
And why wouldn't
we stay at mine?

510
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02.849
Because I live at
Central Park West.

511
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:05.552
And you probably live at some
squalid little studio apartment

512
00:23:05,585 --> 00:23:08.555
with stacks of yellowed
Penguin Classics.

513
00:23:08,588 --> 00:23:09.889
 [woman on PA] 
 Ladies and gentlemen, 

514
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:11.724
 please fasten 
 your seat belts. 

515
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:14.461
 We are beginning our 
 descent into Juneau. 

516
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:15.795
Juneau? I thought we
were going to Sitka.

517
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:21.133
- We are.
- How are we getting to Sitka?

518
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23.135
- [rumbling]
- [rattling]

519
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26.439
Whoa.

520
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:53.533
Alright.
Here we go.

521
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:58.137
- Oh, there he is!
- Andrew!

522
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01.107
- [woman shouting]
- [laughter]

523
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:06.245
Hi. Right this way...

524
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12.084
- Hi!
- Oh...

525
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14.654
- It's so good to see you!
- You're suffocating him, Grace.

526
00:24:14,687 --> 00:24:16.523
- Come here.
- Hey, Gammy.

527
00:24:16,723 --> 00:24:19.592
Ah, Gammy. How are
you doing? Where's Dad?

528
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:22.161
Oh, you know your father.
He's always working.

529
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:24.664
Never mind about him.
Where's your girl?

530
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:26.999
Uh, she's...
right there.

531
00:24:27,033 --> 00:24:28.868
- [Gammy] Ah.
- [Andrew] There she is.

532
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:31.704
I guess the word "girl"
is inappropriate.

533
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:32.739
Annie.

534
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35.474
- Hi!
- [Tate] Hello.

535
00:24:35,675 --> 00:24:36.976
- Margaret, this is my mom.
- Oh, hello.

536
00:24:37,677 --> 00:24:39.145
Yeah, great.
This is my gammy, Annie.

537
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:42.715
- Pleasure.
- Well, hello there.

538
00:24:42,749 --> 00:24:47.620
Now, do you prefer being called
Margaret or Satan's Mistress?

539
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49.556
We've heard it
both ways.

540
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51.190
[Gammy] Actually we've
heard it lots of ways.

541
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:52.959
She's kidding.

542
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55.528
- Oh! Oh... OK.
- [chuckling]

543
00:24:55,562 --> 00:24:57.697
Thank you so much
for...

544
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58.765
allowing me to be a
part of this weekend.

545
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01.968
Oh, you're welcome.
We're thrilled to have you.

546
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:03.703
Let's get you two
back to the fort.

547
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05.872
- OK.
- [Gammy] Oh...

548
00:25:05,905 --> 00:25:08.875
- It's so good to see you.
- [grunts] There we are.

549
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:43.943
[Tate whispers] Andrew...

550
00:25:44,711 --> 00:25:47.113
[slightly louder]
Andrew. Andrew!

551
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:52.752
[yelps] Please,
don't do that.

552
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:55.755
You didn't tell me about all
the family businesses, honey.

553
00:25:55,788 --> 00:25:58.725
He was probably just
being modest, dear.

554
00:25:58,758 --> 00:25:59.892
Oh.

555
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:10.737
What are we doing? Shouldn't we
check into our hotel right now?

556
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12.772
Oh, we canceled
your reservation.

557
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14.774
Family doesn't
stay at a hotel.

558
00:26:14,807 --> 00:26:16.142
You're gonna
stay in our home.

559
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:18.210
Oh, great! Great.

560
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20.079
- What?
- [grunts] God.

561
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:21.981
You're gonna wanna use
your legs to lift that one.

562
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:24.784
Andrew! Help her
with those.

563
00:26:24,984 --> 00:26:27.119
I'd love to, but she
won't let me do anything.

564
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:28.587
She insists on
doing it all herself.

565
00:26:29,155 --> 00:26:30.923
She's one of those...
she's a feminist.

566
00:26:35,127 --> 00:26:36.796
[grunts]

567
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:41.167
Come on, sweetie.

568
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45.638
[Grammy] You see the shoes
that broad was wearing?

569
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:55.948
This is the
last of 'em.

570
00:26:57,784 --> 00:26:59.151
- Oh!
- Ooh.

571
00:26:59,185 --> 00:27:02.088
- [Andrew] Five second rule.
- Got it!

572
00:27:02,121 --> 00:27:04.791
That will
dry right off.

573
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06.826
Psst! Psst! I'm not
getting on that boat.

574
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:08.661
You don't have to.
See you in a few days.

575
00:27:08,695 --> 00:27:10.763
Psst! You know
I can't swim.

576
00:27:10,797 --> 00:27:13.399
Hence, the boat.

577
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21.708
Come on.

578
00:27:26,713 --> 00:27:28.080
[Andrew] Come on.
Here we go.

579
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:38.190
Looking good, boss.
Take your time, though.

580
00:27:38,224 --> 00:27:40.159
Shh.

581
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:47.734
She comes with
a lot of baggage.

582
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:48.735
Just gonna give you
a little hand here.

583
00:27:50,737 --> 00:27:53.706
Hand off ass!
Off ass!

584
00:27:56,075 --> 00:27:59.078
There you go.
You're there.

585
00:28:03,816 --> 00:28:07.854
Congratulations. I'm a
hundred years old now.

586
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09.856
[boat engine starting]

587
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35.915
[Grace] Here we are.
We're home.

588
00:28:38,217 --> 00:28:40.119
That is your home?

589
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43.790
Who are you people?

590
00:28:58,805 --> 00:28:59.939
[Tate] Why did you
tell me you were poor?

591
00:29:00,139 --> 00:29:00.940
[Andrew] I never said
I was poor.

592
00:29:01,808 --> 00:29:02.975
But you never told
me you were rich.

593
00:29:03,009 --> 00:29:04.977
I'm not rich.
My parents are rich.

594
00:29:05,011 --> 00:29:07.213
OK, you know what? That's
something only rich people say.

595
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08.981
[woman] Hey, Andrew!
Welcome home!

596
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:11.951
Hi! Mom, what is this?

597
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:14.486
Nothing. It's just a
little welcoming party.

598
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15.487
Is that a crime?

599
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:17.957
Just 50 of our closest
friends and neighbors.

600
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:19.458
And all excited
to meet you.

601
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21.928
- Oh, good. Good.
- Come on. Come on.

602
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:24.430
- A party?
- Yeah, I guess so.

603
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:28.567
Come on. Let's go. My grandma's
moving faster than you.

604
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29.701
Put your back into it.

605
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33.940
[* Michael Bublé:
 I've Got You Under My Skin] 

606
00:29:34,506 --> 00:29:35.808
- [indistinct chatter]
- [laughter]

607
00:29:37,009 --> 00:29:37.844
[woman] So nice to meet you,
Margaret. Welcome to Sitka.

608
00:29:37,877 --> 00:29:39.879
Jill? Hi. Nice to
meet you. My pleasure.

609
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42.849
Why didn't you tell me you were
some kind of Alaskan Kennedy?

610
00:29:42,882 --> 00:29:44.516
How could I?

611
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:45.451
We were in the middle
of talking about you

612
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:47.887
for the last
three years.

613
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49.488
OK, know what?
Timeout, OK?

614
00:29:49,889 --> 00:29:51.190
This bickering Bickerson
thing has got to stop.

615
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:52.992
People need to think that we
are in love. So let's just...

616
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:54.560
That, that's no problem.
I can do that.

617
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57.864
I can pretend to be the
doting fiancé. That's easy.

618
00:29:57,897 --> 00:29:59.465
But for you,
it's going to require

619
00:29:59,999 --> 00:30:01.834
that you stop snacking on
children while they dream.

620
00:30:01,868 --> 00:30:04.036
Very funny. When are you going
to tell them we're engaged?

621
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05.905
I'll pick the
right moment.

622
00:30:05,938 --> 00:30:09.541
Hey, Andrew. Hi!

623
00:30:09,575 --> 00:30:12.611
Mrs. McKittrick. How are you?
Nice to see you.

624
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14.046
Nice to see you, Mr. McKittrick.
This is Margaret.

625
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16.048
- Hi. Pleasure.
- Margaret!

626
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:17.984
Hi, how are you?
Pleasure.

627
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:21.053
So I always wanted to know,
what does a book editor do?

628
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:23.155
[man] That's a great
question, Louise.

629
00:30:23,189 --> 00:30:25.191
I'm curious to know
the answer myself.

630
00:30:27,026 --> 00:30:28.427
- Hello, Dad.
- Son.

631
00:30:29,095 --> 00:30:30.897
This must be Maggie.

632
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:32.631
Uh, Margaret.

633
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36.002
- Joe. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

634
00:30:36,035 --> 00:30:39.571
So why don't you tell us
exactly what a book editor does.

635
00:30:39,605 --> 00:30:43.075
Besides taking writers out
to lunch and getting bombed.

636
00:30:43,109 --> 00:30:45.511
[Louise] Now that
sounds like fun.

637
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:47.513
No wonder you like
being an editor.

638
00:30:47,546 --> 00:30:48.981
No, Louise.
Andrew's not an editor,

639
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50.516
he's an editor's
assistant.

640
00:30:50,549 --> 00:30:53.019
Maggie here
is the editor.

641
00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54.954
Margaret.

642
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:58.524
- So you're actually...
- Andrew's boss. Yeah.

643
00:30:58,557 --> 00:30:59.892
[McKittrick] Well.
How about that.

644
00:30:59,926 --> 00:31:01.427
[Louise] Huh.

645
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03.429
I think I'll
get a refill.

646
00:31:05,965 --> 00:31:10.937
- Charming.
- * And I love you 
 under my skin * 

647
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14.073
That's a hell of a
first impression, Dad.

648
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:15.942
What the hell, Andrew?

649
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:18.945
You show up here after all this
time with this woman you hated

650
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:20.046
- and now she's your girlfriend?
- We just got here.

651
00:31:20,446 --> 00:31:21.580
Can we wait two seconds

652
00:31:22,648 --> 00:31:22.681
before we throw the
kitchen sink at each other?

653
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26.185
Just never figured you for a guy
who slept his way to the middle.

654
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27.954
Actually, I'll have you know
that that woman in there

655
00:31:29,055 --> 00:31:29.588
is one of the most
respected editors in town.

656
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30.990
She's your meal ticket,

657
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:32.058
and you brought her home
to meet your mother.

658
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:36.628
She's not my meal ticket, Dad.
She's my fiancée.

659
00:31:36,662 --> 00:31:39.098
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

660
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40.899
I'm getting married.

661
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:46.572
- How are you?
- Good, good. Thank you.

662
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:47.906
Would you care for
some hors d'oeuvres?

663
00:31:48,474 --> 00:31:48.907
No, I'm fine.
Thank you very much.

664
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50.642
It's a tradition.

665
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52.144
It's the texture.
I'm not a fish person.

666
00:31:53,579 --> 00:31:54.947
- You'll like it.
- You're very sweet.

667
00:31:54,981 --> 00:31:57.483
I think if you'll
just taste it.

668
00:31:57,516 --> 00:31:58.684
[muffled]
Thank you so much.

669
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04.023
[Andrew] Ladies
and gentlemen...

670
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:05.857
I have a very important
announcement to make.

671
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:08.027
Margaret and I
are getting married.

672
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08.961
It's the paprika.

673
00:32:09,161 --> 00:32:10.596
So sorry.

674
00:32:10,629 --> 00:32:13.432
That's OK.
It's wash-and-wear.

675
00:32:15,167 --> 00:32:18.037
[Andrew] Yep.
Honey? Where you at?

676
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:20.539
Here it is.

677
00:32:24,043 --> 00:32:25.477
Come on down here,
pumpkin.

678
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:27.046
- [Andrew] All right.
- OK.

679
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29.982
Oh, look at her.
Look at her.

680
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:31.117
[clapping]

681
00:32:32,151 --> 00:32:33.585
Right there, ladies and
gentlemen. There she is.

682
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:36.022
[woman]
Congratulations, Andrew.

683
00:32:36,055 --> 00:32:37.156
Thank you.

684
00:32:37,189 --> 00:32:39.091
[Andrew]
Thank you very much.

685
00:32:39,125 --> 00:32:41.193
- [woman] Time to celebrate.
- [woman 2] Get the champagne.

686
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:45.998
So that was your idea
of the perfect time

687
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:47.466
- to tell them we're engaged?
- Mmm.

688
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:48.734
'Cause it was brilliant.
Brilliant timing.

689
00:32:48,767 --> 00:32:51.137
Andrew. Hi.

690
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55.207
Gert? Oh, my God.
Hey, hi. Wow.

691
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:58.044
How you doing? I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

692
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:01.013
Your mom probably wanted it to
be a surprise. So... surprise.

693
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:03.549
- Right.
- And...

694
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:06.685
...we're being
completely rude. Hi.

695
00:33:06,718 --> 00:33:09.721
- [Andrew] Oh, God.
This is my ex...
- Hi. I'm Gertrude.

696
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:12.224
- Oh! Oh, wow. Wow!
- You can call me Gert.

697
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14.093
Well, congratulations,
you guys.

698
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:15.161
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

699
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17.429
So did I
miss the story?

700
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19.431
- What story?
- What story?

701
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:20.899
About how you proposed.

702
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:25.471
Oh! How a man proposes says
a lot about his character.

703
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27.573
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

704
00:33:27,606 --> 00:33:30.042
I actually would love
to hear the story, Andrew.

705
00:33:30,076 --> 00:33:31.577
Would you tell us?

706
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34.080
- [man] Yeah.
- [crowd murmurs] Yeah.

707
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35.814
- [giggling]
- [Andrew] You know what?

708
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:40.052
Actually, Margaret loves
telling this story...

709
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:42.521
so I'm just gonna let her
go ahead and do that.

710
00:33:42,554 --> 00:33:44.656
[Andrew] 'Cause I think we
should just sit in rapture.

711
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:48.227
Huh! Wow, OK.

712
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51.797
Wow, where to begin...
this story.

713
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:54.700
Well... umm, wow.

714
00:33:54,733 --> 00:33:57.069
Mmm... yeah.

715
00:33:57,103 --> 00:34:02.108
OK, well, umm,
Andrew and I...

716
00:34:02,141 --> 00:34:04.610
Andrew and I were
about to celebrate

717
00:34:04,643 --> 00:34:07.546
- our first
anniversary together.
- [all] Ahh.

718
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10.449
And I knew that he'd been
itching to ask me to marry him.

719
00:34:10,482 --> 00:34:13.552
And he was scared.
Like a little tiny bird.

720
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:16.155
So I started leaving him
little hints here and there...

721
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:18.724
...because I knew he wouldn't
have the guts to ask, but...

722
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:21.560
That's not exactly
how it happened.

723
00:34:21,593 --> 00:34:23.429
- No? Hmm.
- No. No.

724
00:34:23,462 --> 00:34:25.697
I mean, I picked up on
all her little hints.

725
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27.666
This woman's about
as subtle as a gun.

726
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30.136
- [all laugh]
- [Andrew] Yeah.

727
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:31.437
What I was worried
about was

728
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:33.139
that she might find
this little box...

729
00:34:33,172 --> 00:34:36.242
Oh! The decoupage box
that he made

730
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38.544
where he'd taken
the time to cut out

731
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41.580
tiny, little pictures
of himself. Yes.

732
00:34:41,613 --> 00:34:45.217
Just pasted all over the
box. Oh! So beautiful.

733
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:47.753
So I opened that beautiful,
little decoupage

734
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:51.723
and out fluttered these tiny,
little hand-cut heart confettis.

735
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:55.594
And once they cleared,
I looked down, and I saw...

736
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:58.264
...the most
beautiful, big...

737
00:34:58,297 --> 00:34:59.731
...fat nothing.

738
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:01.133
No ring.

739
00:35:01,167 --> 00:35:03.135
- No ring?
- What?

740
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:05.904
No. But inside that box...

741
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07.673
...underneath
all that crap...

742
00:35:07,706 --> 00:35:09.908
...there was a little
handwritten note...

743
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13.612
with the address to
a hotel, date, and time.

744
00:35:13,645 --> 00:35:15.247
Real Humphrey Bogart-type stuff.

745
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18.584
- Masculine.
- [grunts]

746
00:35:18,617 --> 00:35:20.519
Anyway, naturally,
Margaret thought...

747
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:21.753
I thought he was
seeing someone else.

748
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23.222
[crowd murmurs]

749
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:24.223
It was a terrible
time for me,

750
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:26.658
but I went to
that hotel anyway.

751
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28.694
I went there and I
pounded on the door,

752
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30.629
but the door was
already unlocked.

753
00:35:30,662 --> 00:35:34.533
And as swung open that
door, there he was...

754
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36.268
- Standing.
- Kneeling.

755
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:37.736
- Like a man.
- On a bed of rose petals,

756
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41.340
in a tuxedo.
Your son. Your son.

757
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:45.177
And he was choking back
soft, soft sobs.

758
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:48.247
And when he held back the tears
and finally caught his breath,

759
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49.215
he said to me...

760
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50.182
"Margaret,
will you marry me?"

761
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53.585
And she said, "Yep."
The end. Who's hungry?

762
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56.222
[crowd cooing]

763
00:35:56,255 --> 00:35:58.690
That is quite a story.

764
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00.626
- [Grammy] Oh, Andy!
- Gorgeous.

765
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03.262
You are so sensitive.

766
00:36:03,929 --> 00:36:07.233
Hand-cut confetti?
[laughs]

767
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:09.901
Hey! Let's see a kiss
from you two cuties.

768
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:10.836
[man] Give her a kiss!

769
00:36:11,237 --> 00:36:13.239
- No. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

770
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:14.206
- Come on!
- [all cheering]

771
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15.641
OK, all right.

772
00:36:15,674 --> 00:36:16.775
OK. Here we go.
Ready?

773
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:23.715
What is this? Kiss her on
the mouth like you mean it.

774
00:36:23,749 --> 00:36:27.286
- Kiss her. Kiss her!
- [all chanting] Kiss her!

775
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:30.889
Kiss her! Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her!

776
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32.458
OK!

777
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:34.926
- OK. All right.
- OK.

778
00:36:35,394 --> 00:36:37.229
- Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm. OK.

779
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:40.699
- Oh!
- [chuckles]

780
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:43.369
Andy! Give her
a real kiss!

781
00:36:43,402 --> 00:36:46.305
- [chuckling] Gammy.
- A real one!

782
00:36:46,338 --> 00:36:47.706
- [woman] Yeah
- [woman 2] You can do it!

783
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:49.275
Why don't we just do it?
Let's just do it really fast.

784
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:50.309
Yeah. OK.

785
00:36:50,542 --> 00:36:52.878
- [both] Mmmm.
- [cheering]

786
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55.881
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

787
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58.250
- [muffled] OK.
- Mmm.

788
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:07.826
Hmm.

789
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11.863
I'm so happy
for you two!

790
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:15.434
So happy!
So happy!

791
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17.636
[woman] Let's get
the champagne!

792
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:20.005
So here we are.

793
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23.475
This is your bedroom.

794
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:30.916
Wow. Wow, this is, um...
beautiful. And the view.

795
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32.751
And here's the bed.

796
00:37:32,784 --> 00:37:35.554
Wow! Exquisite bed.
Exquisite.

797
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:38.624
So... where is
Andrew's room?

798
00:37:38,657 --> 00:37:40.459
Oh, sweetie, we're not
under any illusions

799
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:43.429
that you two don't
sleep in the same bed.

800
00:37:43,462 --> 00:37:45.731
[laughing] He'll sleep
in here with you.

801
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48.334
Oh, great, 'cause
we love to snuggle.

802
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:50.369
- Don't we, honey.
- We're huge snugglers.

803
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:52.471
- [barking]
- Oh, my God. What is it?

804
00:37:52,504 --> 00:37:56.442
- Calm down, Kevin.
- Whoa! You are cute.

805
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58.076
Who is this?

806
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01.747
- That's Kevin.
I'm sorry, Margaret.
- So cute.

807
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03.749
We just rescued him
from the pound,

808
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05.784
and he's still in
training. Sorry.

809
00:38:05,817 --> 00:38:07.753
Just be sure you don't
let him outside,

810
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:09.621
or the eagles
will snatch him.

811
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11.457
No, don't you
listen to her.

812
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13.692
She's just pulling
your leg, isn't she?

813
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:16.762
By the way, there are extra
towels and linens and things

814
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:17.629
in here
if you need them.

815
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:19.698
[Grammy] And if you
get chilly tonight...

816
00:38:19,731 --> 00:38:21.467
...use this.

817
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:23.369
It has
special powers.

818
00:38:23,402 --> 00:38:26.338
Oh, what kind of
special powers?

819
00:38:26,372 --> 00:38:27.839
I call it
the Baby Maker.

820
00:38:27,873 --> 00:38:30.041
OK, well.
Then I guess we...

821
00:38:30,075 --> 00:38:31.710
...gonna be super careful
with that one.

822
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33.812
- Yeah, I'm just gonna...
- Don't throw it on the bed.

823
00:38:34,012 --> 00:38:35.781
We'd better turn in.
It's been quite an evening.

824
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:37.549
So good night,
everybody.

825
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:38.917
- Good night.
- Good night.

826
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:41.687
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

827
00:38:43,589 --> 00:38:44.823
- [chuckling] Good night.
- [Tate] Good night.

828
00:38:47,859 --> 00:38:49.728
- [Gammy] Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

829
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51.129
Thank you so much.
Sweet dreams.

830
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52.931
- Bye-bye, now.
- Bye.

831
00:38:56,535 --> 00:38:59.070
[Tate] So, uh... you haven't
been home in a while.

832
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:02.508
I haven't had a lot of vacation
time the last three years.

833
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04.443
[Tate] Stop complaining.

834
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:10.081
Umm...
Don't look, OK?

835
00:39:11,016 --> 00:39:12.418
OK.

836
00:39:13,585 --> 00:39:14.820
Are your eyes closed?

837
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:16.422
Completely.

838
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:19.425
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

839
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31.870
Those are the pajamas you
decided to bring to Alaska.

840
00:39:31,903 --> 00:39:35.574
Yes, because I was supposed
to be in a hotel alone.

841
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:38.410
- Remember?
- Can we just go to sleep?

842
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40.546
- Fine.
- Great.

843
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50.756
[exhales, clears throat]

844
00:40:10,075 --> 00:40:12.578
Well. [clears throat]

845
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:13.812
Looks like I won't be
getting much sleep

846
00:40:14,112 --> 00:40:16.081
with the sun

847
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:23.855
Thank you.

848
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:40.939
[phone ringing]

849
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47.045
[Margaret] Andrew. Phone.

850
00:40:47,779 --> 00:40:50.849
Andrew!

851
00:40:50,882 --> 00:40:53.151
Crap. Andrew,
Andrew, phone.

852
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:54.620
Andrew!

853
00:40:54,653 --> 00:40:56.187
Yeah... right.

854
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:03.695
- Andrew, where is it?
- Purse, side pocket.

855
00:41:05,063 --> 00:41:07.599
- [thumping]
- [grunting]

856
00:41:08,734 --> 00:41:12.137
Hello. Hello? Hello.

857
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14.139
Frank! Frank, darling.

858
00:41:14,172 --> 00:41:15.006
Darling, Frank.

859
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:17.743
Are you there?
Hello? Hello? Oh, crap.

860
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:20.979
I have horrible service, Frank.
Give me just one minute.

861
00:41:21,012 --> 00:41:23.181
Oh, my God!
Margaret!

862
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25.717
[whispering] One... one minute.
Frank, hold on just a second.

863
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:26.785
Frank, hold on.
No, no, no, no.

864
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:27.953
[door shuts]

865
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30.656
Frank. Frank,
I'm sorry you feel

866
00:41:30,689 --> 00:41:33.692
I pressured you into
doing Oprah, but...

867
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:36.895
Of course I want you
to be happy. Yes, yes.

868
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:42.734
Frank. Frank. Frank, darling.
Frank? It's going to be fine.

869
00:41:42,768 --> 00:41:44.770
I can just call them
and I can cancel.

870
00:41:46,071 --> 00:41:47.539
[panting]

871
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:52.043
[Tate] You are...
you are so right, Frank.

872
00:41:52,077 --> 00:41:53.912
Yes, Frank, of course
I'm listening to you.

873
00:41:53,945 --> 00:41:55.914
Yeah... yes.

874
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57.549
I love listening
to you, Frank.

875
00:41:57,583 --> 00:42:01.019
- [yapping]
- Shh! Sit. Sit.

876
00:42:02,754 --> 00:42:03.354
No, not you, Frank.

877
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:05.624
- No, no.
- [barking]

878
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07.726
Frank, if I may
get down to it, OK...

879
00:42:07,759 --> 00:42:10.929
I think it would be
a mistake to back out.

880
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13.732
- Because, Frank,
for so many years...
- [hawk screeching]

881
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16.568
...you have inspired me
with your beautiful words,

882
00:42:16,602 --> 00:42:17.603
- and I feel that...
- [barking]

883
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:19.537
Shh! Dog, I'm on the phone.

884
00:42:20,806 --> 00:42:22.741
I think it's time that the world
get to enjoy your words as well.

885
00:42:22,774 --> 00:42:24.910
- They are just so rich
with... passion...
- [dog barking]

886
00:42:24,943 --> 00:42:29.615
And I think that we
should all be privy to.

887
00:42:29,648 --> 00:42:31.082
- Frank, I just, uh...
- [screeching]

888
00:42:31,683 --> 00:42:32.784
I just, uh, want you
to be happy, Frank.

889
00:42:32,818 --> 00:42:35.587
Give me that dog!

890
00:42:35,621 --> 00:42:37.889
Frank, hold on a second.
Can you hold a second?

891
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:38.824
Give me that dog!

892
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:41.993
Come on! Come on,
come on, come on.

893
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:44.630
- Come on! Come on! Oh, oh...
- [squeaking]

894
00:42:44,663 --> 00:42:46.898
Oh, oh! Oh, oh.
OK! OK, gotcha.

895
00:42:46,932 --> 00:42:48.967
Frank, Frank.

896
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49.968
Frank? So sorry, so sorry.

897
00:42:51,002 --> 00:42:53.204
So sorry. I dropped the phone.
Now, listen, Frank.

898
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:56.141
I don't want to
sell you on anything,

899
00:42:56,174 --> 00:42:58.076
but this is your
legacy, this book.

900
00:42:58,109 --> 00:42:59.645
And I think
it's up to you to

901
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:00.511
present your legacy
to the world.

902
00:43:01,647 --> 00:43:03.749
And call me tomorrow
with your decision.

903
00:43:03,782 --> 00:43:05.684
And my phone is on
all the time! OK, bye-bye.

904
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:06.184
No! Wait!

905
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:09.988
No! No! N-n-n... no. No

906
00:43:10,021 --> 00:43:11.723
Take the doggy.
Look at the doggy.

907
00:43:11,757 --> 00:43:13.692
I need that phone.
Take the dog.

908
00:43:13,725 --> 00:43:14.960
Take the dog.
I need that phone!

909
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:18.063
Here. Take the dog.
Take the dog. Take it. Take it.

910
00:43:18,096 --> 00:43:20.165
[Grace] Look at this.

911
00:43:20,198 --> 00:43:21.667
[both laughing]

912
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24.135
- Is that cute or what?
- I know.

913
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:29.074
Morning, guys.
Have you seen... daah.

914
00:43:29,107 --> 00:43:32.077
She's playing with Kevin.
We thought she didn't like him.

915
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:33.111
Will you
go get her, Andy?

916
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:35.080
We have a whole day
planned for her,

917
00:43:35,113 --> 00:43:37.683
and she needs
to get ready.

918
00:43:37,716 --> 00:43:39.718
Yeah. Tell her we have
a big surprise for her.

919
00:43:39,751 --> 00:43:40.986
Mmm.

920
00:43:43,855 --> 00:43:46.792
Look! Give me my phone. Come on.
Please, just give me my phone.

921
00:43:46,825 --> 00:43:49.695
- Come on. Right here.
- What the hell are you doing?

922
00:43:49,728 --> 00:43:52.731
Oh, my God. Your grandmother
was completely right.

923
00:43:52,764 --> 00:43:54.766
The eagle came and
tried to take the dog.

924
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57.803
But then I saved him. Then it
came back, and it took my phone.

925
00:43:57,836 --> 00:44:00.706
- Are you drunk?
- What? No! I'm serious.

926
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02.774
He's got my phone, and Frank's
calling me on that phone.

927
00:44:02,808 --> 00:44:05.677
Relax, all right? We'll order
another phone, same number.

928
00:44:05,711 --> 00:44:06.745
We'll go into town
tomorrow and get it.

929
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:08.780
- Really?
- OK? Yeah.

930
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:13.752
- Oh, OK. All right.
Well, you go then.
- [added]

931
00:44:13,785 --> 00:44:15.754
- You have to get ready.
- For what?

932
00:44:15,787 --> 00:44:16.822
You're going out
with Mom and the girls.

933
00:44:17,022 --> 00:44:18.757
I don't want to go out.

934
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:19.791
Shopping, sightseeing.
And a surprise.

935
00:44:20,425 --> 00:44:21.092
- I hate shopping.
- You'll love it.

936
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:22.761
- I hate sightseeing.
- You're going.

937
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:23.695
- No, I don't want to go.
- You're going.

938
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:25.430
- I'm not going. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

939
00:44:26,397 --> 00:44:27.065
Now give me a nice big hug.
We don't want them

940
00:44:28,233 --> 00:44:28.266
- to think we're fighting.
- I don't want to touch you.

941
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:30.668
- Come on. Hug time.
- No, I don't want to...

942
00:44:30,702 --> 00:44:31.803
- Hug time.
- I don't want to...

943
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:33.739
There we go.

944
00:44:33,772 --> 00:44:36.141
Yeah, that's nice.

945
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38.977
Yeah. That's nice.

946
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41.713
There we go.
Isn't that nice?

947
00:44:41,747 --> 00:44:42.948
- Mmm-hmm.
- [Andrew] Mmm-hmm.

948
00:44:43,782 --> 00:44:44.716
- [Tate] Mmm. Yeah.
- [Andrew] Boop boop boop.

949
00:44:45,116 --> 00:44:47.018
If you touch my ass
one more time,

950
00:44:47,052 --> 00:44:48.987
I will cut your balls
off in your sleep. OK?

951
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51.089
- Yeah.
- There you go.

952
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53.892
All righty now. So, uh...
We clear on that?

953
00:44:53,925 --> 00:44:55.994
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Such a good fiancé.

954
00:44:56,027 --> 00:44:57.796
Hmm. Ow.

955
00:45:05,937 --> 00:45:07.773
[splashing]

956
00:45:11,276 --> 00:45:14.780
- [Joe] Jeez.
- You want to see me?

957
00:45:14,813 --> 00:45:17.182
Your mom found
these eco-balls.

958
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19.084
They dissolve in water.

959
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:21.019
[grunts]

960
00:45:21,052 --> 00:45:23.922
I don't know how she
comes up with this stuff.

961
00:45:23,955 --> 00:45:27.926
Anyway, she, uh...
is a little peeved.

962
00:45:27,959 --> 00:45:31.797
Apparently, I wasn't the most
gracious of hosts last night.

963
00:45:31,830 --> 00:45:33.064
It was a little
bit of a shock

964
00:45:33,498 --> 00:45:34.732
to find out that
you're getting married...

965
00:45:35,867 --> 00:45:37.903
...especially when none of us
even knew you were dating.

966
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:42.808
The point is...
I owe you an apology.

967
00:45:44,475 --> 00:45:46.812
Accepted.

968
00:45:46,845 --> 00:45:49.815
There's something else.

969
00:45:49,848 --> 00:45:53.051
I've been going over my
retirement plans recently,

970
00:45:53,084 --> 00:45:54.820
and it got me
thinking.

971
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58.089
I've done a lot
of things in my life.

972
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01.960
Practically built an empire with
your mother from the ground up.

973
00:46:01,993 --> 00:46:02.861
It doesn't mean
anything unless...

974
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04.529
Unless you have
someone to leave it to.

975
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07.933
- We already discussed this.
- I'd like to discuss it again.

976
00:46:07,966 --> 00:46:11.937
You have
responsibilities here.

977
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:13.939
I think I've been
more than understanding

978
00:46:13,972 --> 00:46:15.040
about your goofing off
in New York.

979
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:16.808
I need you to quit
playing around...

980
00:46:16,842 --> 00:46:17.976
Here we go again.

981
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:18.877
When are you going to start

982
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:20.111
taking what I do seriously?

983
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:22.013
When you start
acting seriously.

984
00:46:22,047 --> 00:46:24.950
I'm sorry.

985
00:46:24,983 --> 00:46:26.852
I feel sorry for you, Dad.

986
00:46:26,885 --> 00:46:29.087
I wish you had
another son. I really do.

987
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:30.488
One who wanted
to stay here.

988
00:46:30,989 --> 00:46:32.157
One who wanted to take over
the family business.

989
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:34.860
One who wanted
to marry someone
that you approve of,

990
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:37.896
but it's not me. Now,
it must seem strange to you,

991
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:42.901
my life in New York... sitting
in an office, reading books.

992
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:45.136
But it makes me happy.
You understand?

993
00:46:48,907 --> 00:46:52.010
If that's what makes you happy,
son, I got nothing to say.

994
00:46:52,043 --> 00:46:54.012
Well, that's a first.

995
00:46:54,045 --> 00:46:58.516
You know what? Apology not
accepted. Have fun out here.

996
00:47:11,930 --> 00:47:13.064
[indistinct chatter]

997
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:14.232
[Grace] There is no way you
could leave her at home.

998
00:47:15,533 --> 00:47:16.101
She had to be here.
Absolutely.

999
00:47:17,035 --> 00:47:18.469
She's been
coming here forever.

1000
00:47:18,503 --> 00:47:21.472
I hope you are ready
for your big surprise...

1001
00:47:21,506 --> 00:47:24.575
...because this is one of
Sitka's greatest treasures.

1002
00:47:24,609 --> 00:47:26.945
- Right?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

1003
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:28.914
[* Frankie Goes to Hollywood:
 Relax] 

1004
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:30.015
[Grace] OK, this is
the big surprise

1005
00:47:31,182 --> 00:47:33.584
I was telling you
about. You ready?

You guys were
pretty serious, huh?

1068
00:50:42,573 --> 00:50:45.110
Well, I mean, we dated in high
school and all through college,

1069
00:50:45,143 --> 00:50:47.178
but we were kids.

1070
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51.416
And you guys called
it off because of...

1071
00:50:53,651 --> 00:50:56.154
Well, umm...

1072
00:50:56,187 --> 00:51:00.625
the night before we graduated
school, he proposed...

1073
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:02.227
...and said he
wanted to elope

1074
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04.795
and run away to
New York with me.

1075
00:51:04,829 --> 00:51:07.565
And...

1076
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09.434
You said "no."

1077
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:12.737
And I said "no," yeah.

1078

you're a lucky girl.

you obviously already know.

Oh, yep.
Yep, very much so, yeah.

even doing home?

1183
00:56:01,759 --> 00:56:03.060
Then you just, jump me
out of nowhere? What's that?

1184
00:56:03,093 --> 00:56:05.062
I di... I didn't mean
to jump you.

1185
00:56:05,463 --> 00:56:09.434
Your dog was attacking me, and I
had to run, and I ran into you.

1186
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:10.801
What is it with you
and this dog?

1187
00:56:11,035 --> 00:56:12.870
Just, you know,
just... go.

1188
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14.572
- Go...
- Fine.

1189
00:56:14,605 --> 00:56:16.106
- Go take a shower. You stink.
- Fine.

1190
00:56:16,140 --> 00:56:17.542
- Nice tattoo, by the way.
- What?

1191
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:19.910
[barking]

1192
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:22.413
See? See? Exactly.
You see that?

1193
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:24.949
Oh... barely made it out
with my life there.

1194
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:26.717
See the size of the teeth
on that thing?

1195
00:56:26,751 --> 00:56:28.085
I didn't...

1196
00:56:29,754 --> 00:56:31.088
[groans]

1197
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:37.962
[Margaret clears throat]

1198
00:56:42,467 --> 00:56:47.872
So... [exhales]
So naked.

1199
00:56:47,905 --> 00:56:49.440
[clears throat]

1200
00:56:49,474 --> 00:56:51.942
Can we, uh, not talk
about that, please?

1201
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54.612
Just sayin'.

1202
00:56:59,684 --> 00:57:02.119
So, uh, what's the deal
with you and your father?

1203
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:06.891
Ooh, I'm sorry. That question
is not in the binder. [clicks]

1204
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08.993
Oh, really? Well, I thought
you were the one that said

1205
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:10.595
we needed to learn
all this...

1206
00:57:10,628 --> 00:57:12.463
Not about that
I didn't.

1207
00:57:12,763 --> 00:57:13.931
- But if the guy asks us...
- Not about that, Margaret.

1208
00:57:13,964 --> 00:57:15.833
Good night.

1209
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:30.981
[sighs, clears throat]

1210
00:57:31,015 --> 00:57:35.586
- [Margaret] I like
the Psychic Network.
- What?

1211
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:38.122
Not in the "ha-ha, isn't that
funny, she likes that trash"

1212
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:41.125
kind of way.
I actually quite enjoy it.

1213
00:57:41,158 --> 00:57:42.660
Ummm...

1214
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:48.699
I took disco lessons
in the sixth grade.

1215
00:57:51,201 --> 00:57:55.072
My first concert was
Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock.

1216
00:57:57,575 --> 00:57:59.610
I think Brian Dennehy
is sexy.

1217
00:58:01,211 --> 00:58:02.547
Don't like flowers
in the house,

1218
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:05.850
'cause they
remind me of funerals.

1219
00:58:05,883 --> 00:58:07.151
Never played
a video game.

1220
00:58:08,686 --> 00:58:11.088
I read Wuthering Heights 
every Christmas.

1221
00:58:11,722 --> 00:58:13.891
It's my favorite book.

1222
00:58:16,761 --> 00:58:20.831
Haven't slept with a man
in over a year and a half.

1223
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25.670
And, uh... I went to
the bathroom and cried

1224
00:58:25,703 --> 00:58:28.606
after Bob called me
a poisonous bitch.

1225
00:58:30,174 --> 00:58:32.877
And the, uh,
bird tattoo?

1226
00:58:32,910 --> 00:58:34.645
They're swallows.

1227
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:40.951
Got them when I was 16...
after my parents died.

1228
00:58:43,754 --> 00:58:46.724
Stupid. [clears throat]

1229
00:58:46,757 --> 00:58:48.826
I'm sure there's
many many other things,

1230
00:58:48,859 --> 00:58:51.662
but that's all I can
come up with right now.

1231
00:58:58,603 --> 00:58:59.870
You, uh, there?
[chuckles]

1232
00:59:02,807 --> 00:59:04.041
I'm here.

1233
00:59:06,811 --> 00:59:08.646
Just processing.

1234
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:17.722
You really haven't slept
with anyone in 18 months?

1235
00:59:17,755 --> 00:59:20.024
Oh, my God. Out of all that,
that's all you got?

1236
00:59:20,057 --> 00:59:21.759
That's a long time.

1237
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23.894
Yeah, well, I've been
a little busy.

1238
00:59:23,928 --> 00:59:26.096
Yeah...

1239
00:59:28,899 --> 00:59:30.735
Who's, uh...

1240
00:59:30,768 --> 00:59:33.871
- Rob Base and D.J...
- E-Z Rock?

1241
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35.773
- Yeah.
- You know.

1242
00:59:35,806 --> 00:59:36.974
[sings It Takes Two] 

1243
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:38.743
 * It takes two to make 
 a thing go right * 

1244
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:40.344
 * It takes two to make it 
 out of sight * 

1245
00:59:40,377 --> 00:59:41.646
 * Drr nrr nrr  

1246
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44.148
- No. They were good.
- Mm-mm.

1247
00:59:46,784 --> 00:59:48.052
[chuckles]

1248
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:52.122
- What?
- Nothing.

1249
00:59:52,657 --> 00:59:55.626
I know who they are. I just
wanted to hear you sing it.

1250
00:59:55,826 --> 00:59:57.862
[Andrew laughing]

1251
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:01.065
[sighs]

1252
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:06.603
- Margaret?
- Yes?

1253
01:00:08,673 --> 01:00:10.808
Don't take this
the wrong way.

1254
01:00:12,777 --> 01:00:15.780
[clears throat] 'K.

1255
01:00:15,813 --> 01:00:20.651
You are a very...
very beautiful woman.

1256
01:00:25,122 --> 01:00:27.124
 [Andrew whispering] 
 * I wanna rock right now  

1257
01:00:27,858 --> 01:00:29.927
 * I'm Rob Base and 
 I came to get down * 

1258
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:32.162
 [both whispering] * I'm not 
 internationally known * 

1259
01:00:32,196 --> 01:00:34.431
 * But I'm known 
 to rock the microphone * 

1260
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35.733
 * 'Cause I get stupid...  

1261
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:36.734
 [loudly] * It takes two  

1262
01:00:37,534 --> 01:00:37.835

[laughing]

1264
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42.673
 * It takes two 
 to make it outta sight * 

1265
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:44.108
 * Duh nuh nuh

 * It takes two 
 to make a thing go right * 

1267
01:00:47,077 --> 01:00:47.878
- Feel it deep, feel it low.
- Mmm-hmm.

1268
01:00:47,912 --> 01:00:49.714
 * It takes two to make it...  

1269
01:00:49,747 --> 01:00:52.717
God, I can't
sing that high.

1270
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54.985
[both laughing]

1271
01:01:07,932 --> 01:01:10.200
[birds chirping]

1272
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17.775
Huh? Where am ?

1273
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21.011
What time is it?

1274
01:01:21,045 --> 01:01:22.412
- What time is it?
- [blinds sliding]

1275
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:26.083
Ooh! Ooh. Shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh...

1276
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:40.130
Oh, God.

1277
01:02:01,218 --> 01:02:02.887
[knocking]

1278
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:06.757
[Grace] Room service.
Breakfast for the happy couple.

1279
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:08.826
- [whispers] Andrew! Andrew!
- [groaning]

1280
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:12.096
- Andr...
- [grunts]

1281
01:02:12,129 --> 01:02:13.764
Your mother's
at the door. Get up!

1282
01:02:13,798 --> 01:02:14.765
- Get up here! Your mother's...
- Oh, God.

1283
01:02:15,132 --> 01:02:16.166
[Margaret shouts]
Just a second!

1284
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:23.473
- Not the baby blanket.
- OK, all right.

1285
01:02:23,507 --> 01:02:26.110
Not the baby blanket. Get it
off, get it off, get it off.

1286
01:02:26,143 --> 01:02:27.978
- OK, all right.
- Wait a second. Hold on.

1287
01:02:28,012 --> 01:02:30.080
- What? What?
- Are you wearing makeup?

1288
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:31.816
What? No.
Of course not.

1289
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:34.885
- OK, what do we do? All right.
- Just spoon me, spoon me...

1290
01:02:34,919 --> 01:02:37.922
- Oh, my God! What is that?
- I'm sorry. It's morning.

1291
01:02:37,955 --> 01:02:39.924
What do you mean,
"It's morning"?

1292
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:41.792
[Grace] Are you OK?

1293
01:02:41,826 --> 01:02:44.094
Yep! Coming. One second. Yep.
Come on in. Everything's fine.

1294
01:02:44,128 --> 01:02:46.964
[whispers] Disgusting.

1295
01:02:46,997 --> 01:02:48.532
Ow, you're on my hair.
OK, just...

1296
01:02:48,966 --> 01:02:53.904
[both panting]

1297
01:02:53,938 --> 01:02:57.074
- [Margaret] Oh, wow.
- [Andrew] Ooh, smells good.

1298
01:02:57,107 --> 01:02:58.976
Cinnamon rolls.

1299
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:00.911
Oh, you shouldn't have
gone to that trouble.

1300
01:03:00,945 --> 01:03:03.914
Oh, you're family now.
It's no trouble.

1301
01:03:03,948 --> 01:03:06.450
Hey, you have room
for one more?

1302
01:03:06,483 --> 01:03:10.254
Wow. Could we not do the
Brady family meeting right now?

1303
01:03:10,287 --> 01:03:11.488
We just got up...

1304
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:13.057
- Yeah.
- ...if you don't mind.

1305
01:03:14,058 --> 01:03:14.959
Your mother and I have
come up with a proposition

1306
01:03:15,926 --> 01:03:18.495
and I happen to think
it's a terrific idea...

1307
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:21.832
- We want you to get
married here tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

1308
01:03:23,901 --> 01:03:26.203
- What? What? What?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

1309
01:03:26,236 --> 01:03:27.571
Well, you're gonna
get married anyway,

1310
01:03:28,205 --> 01:03:29.874
so why don't you
get married here...

1311
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:30.908
...where we can
be all together,

1312
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:34.845
and that way Grandma Annie
can be a part of it.

1313
01:03:34,879 --> 01:03:37.114
- Oh. Oh, we're...
- No.

1314
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:41.185
- No. No, it's Gammy's
big birthday tomorrow night.
- Big day for her.

1315
01:03:41,218 --> 01:03:43.921
We don't want to ruin it.
That's you know...

1316
01:03:43,954 --> 01:03:46.991
I've had 89 birthday parties,
I don't need another one.

1317
01:03:47,024 --> 01:03:48.926
Oh, Gammy.

1318
01:03:48,959 --> 01:03:51.195
It would be a dream
come true for me

1319
01:03:51,228 --> 01:03:53.630
to see my one
grandchild's wedding.

1320
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56.033
- A dream come true!
- [Andrew] Mmmm.

1321
01:03:56,066 --> 01:03:59.069
- So you'll do it?
- [Andrew] Mmm-mmm.

1322
01:03:59,103 --> 01:04:00.905
Before I'm dead?

1323
01:04:00,938 --> 01:04:02.039
- OK. OK.
- OK.

1324
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:06.977
OK, we will do
everything.

1325
01:04:07,011 --> 01:04:09.546
And you can get married
like we did, in the barn.

1326
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11.916
It's a Paxton
family tradition.

1327
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:14.518
- Oh, wow!
- Yup.

1328
01:04:14,919 --> 01:04:19.957
Wow! Uh! I've always wanted to
get married in a... in a barn.

1329
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22.059
- I have.
- It's a sign.

1330
01:04:22,092 --> 01:04:25.930
A sign from the universe that
you're meant to be together.

1331
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:29.166
Oh, we must give thanks,
I tell you.

1332
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:32.202
Come, come.
We must give thanks.

1333
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:35.005
OK, I know I should
leave you alone now.

1334
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38.142
But we're just so excited!
I know you're excited, too.

1335
01:04:38,575 --> 01:04:40.577
- It's the craziest.
- Really excited.

1336
01:04:40,610 --> 01:04:43.547
- [Andrew] Yeah! Go. Go.
- [Margaret laughing]

1337
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44.915
Go.

1338
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:52.689
Oh, my God.

1339
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54.925
When my mom finds out that
this whole thing is a sham

1340
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:56.026
she's gonna...
she's gonna be crushed,

1341
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:58.528
and my grandmother's
gonna die.

1342
01:04:58,562 --> 01:04:59.930
- Your mom's not
going to find out.
- I... my father.

1343
01:05:01,498 --> 01:05:01.598
What the hell's with that?
The whole wedding thing?

1344
01:05:02,266 --> 01:05:02.599
Where did that
come from?

1345
01:05:03,433 --> 01:05:05.102
She probably got him
worked up into it.

1346
01:05:05,135 --> 01:05:06.136
It's fine.
She's not gonna find out.

1347
01:05:07,104 --> 01:05:08.572
- They're not going to find out.
- Oh, God. Margaret!

1348
01:05:08,605 --> 01:05:12.009
Andrew, they're not gonna
find out, OK? Just relax.

1349
01:05:12,042 --> 01:05:13.643
It's gonna be OK.

1350
01:05:13,677 --> 01:05:15.980
It's not like we're
gonna be married forever.

1351
01:05:16,013 --> 01:05:18.648
We'll be happily divorced
before you know it.

1352
01:05:18,682 --> 01:05:23.120
It will be fine.
It will be fine.

1353
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:24.554
You OK?

1354
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:26.156
Yeah.

1355
01:05:30,127 --> 01:05:33.497
- Get us some coffee.
- Yeah.

1356
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:37.001
So, would you like
a cinnamon soy latte?

1357
01:05:37,034 --> 01:05:38.602
- A-ha.
- [Margaret chuckles]

1358
01:05:43,607 --> 01:05:45.109
[Andrew] You're right,
you know...

1359
01:05:45,509 --> 01:05:46.343
Get a quickie divorce,
we'll be fine.

1360
01:05:47,211 --> 01:05:47.978
- Absolutely.
- It's gonna be fine.

1361
01:05:48,012 --> 01:05:50.680
Everything is
going to be great.

1362
01:05:50,714 --> 01:05:52.482
But this little missus
better learn how to cook...

1363
01:05:52,682 --> 01:05:54.151
...so she can take care
of her husband.

1364
01:05:54,184 --> 01:05:55.119
Keep my man happy.

1365
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:56.753
I don't want him leaving
me for another woman.

1366
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:58.188
- [both laugh]
- Come on...

1367
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:00.991
...haven't left you
yet, Margaret.

1368
01:06:01,191 --> 01:06:04.061
I got it. Let go.

1369
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:08.465
- You all right?
- Yeah, umm...

1370
01:06:08,498 --> 01:06:09.699
You know what?
I'm gonna go.

1371
01:06:09,733 --> 01:06:11.501
Where?

1372
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:14.004
I just kinda feel
like going outside.

1373
01:06:14,038 --> 01:06:17.041
All right.
That's the bathroom.

1374
01:06:17,074 --> 01:06:18.208
Oh, yeah. I know.
I'm just, uh...

1375
01:06:18,242 --> 01:06:19.076
I'm gonna go to go
to the bathroom,

1376
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21.211
and then I'm gonna
go out, outside.

1377
01:06:21,245 --> 01:06:22.146
All right.

1378
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:25.015
[exhales] All right.

1379
01:06:36,093 --> 01:06:41.165
OK, you just have to focus,
Margaret. Just focus.

1380
01:06:41,198 --> 01:06:43.667
This is a business deal.
This is just a business deal.

1381
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:48.438
[clears throat] Everything's
gonna be just fine.

1382
01:06:49,739 --> 01:06:53.543
OK, this is a little
rough. I can do this.

1383
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:57.747
Oh, my God.
God, I hate nature!

1384
01:06:57,781 --> 01:06:59.149
I hate it.

1385
01:06:59,183 --> 01:07:02.552
Not stopping.
Not stopping. Oh! Oh...

1386
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:04.521
Why are you not stopping?

1387
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:06.723
[growls] Stop, stop,
stop it, stop!

1388
01:07:06,756 --> 01:07:08.525
[panting]

1389
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:13.697
I just wanted...
some air.

1390
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:18.202
[drum beating]

1391
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:20.570
- What is that?
- [flute begins to play]

1392
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:25.542
What now? What is that?
What is that?

1393
01:07:25,575 --> 01:07:27.444
- [drum and flute continue]
- What is that?

1394
01:07:36,120 --> 01:07:40.557
[woman chanting

1395
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:42.426
- [chanting continues]
- [Margaret] What is that?

1396
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:48.132
[chanting continues]

1397
01:07:59,209 --> 01:08:02.112
[woman] Come to me,
Margaret of New York.

1398
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:04.614
It is I, Grandma Annie.

1399
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06.216
Oh!

1400
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:08.652
[Grammy] I see you
are a curious one.

1401
01:08:08,685 --> 01:08:11.555
Come. See how I give
thanks to Mother Earth.

1402
01:08:11,588 --> 01:08:14.124
You know, actually,
I'm not that curious.

1403
01:08:14,158 --> 01:08:16.160
- I'll just...
- [Grammy] Look around you.

1404
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:18.762
Mother Earth has
provided all this...

1405
01:08:18,795 --> 01:08:23.267
...just as she brought you and
Andrew together to be joined.

1406
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25.735
- Oh.
- We must give thanks

1407
01:08:25,769 --> 01:08:28.838
and ask that your loins
be abundantly fertile.

1408
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:32.576
Come. Dance with me
in celebration.

1409
01:08:32,609 --> 01:08:35.512
You know, can I, can I
just thank her from here?

1410
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:37.781
I insist!

1411
01:08:37,814 --> 01:08:40.184
OK, OK, OK.

1412
01:08:40,217 --> 01:08:42.719
I will come down
and dance with you.

1413
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:47.924
Follow and learn.

1414
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:51.928

1415
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:55.865
Come on, Margaret! Feel the
rhythm of the drums. Now you.

Chant what?

[stammers] Whatever comes
to you. It is the way.

1419
01:09:01,738 --> 01:09:04.941
- But I don't know any chants.
- To the trees. Use your vowels.

1420
01:09:04,974 --> 01:09:08.878
- Eee. Ooo. Ooo. Eee.

You know, it went

01:10:34,831 --> 01:10:36.900
Your phone arrived.

1463
01:10:36,933 --> 01:10:38.502
I'm gonna go into town
to pick it up. Wanna come?

1464
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:41.305
Oh, yes, I want to go.
I want to go. Oh, Hold on.

1465
01:10:41,338 --> 01:10:44.541
Is it, uh, OK
if I go with him?

1466
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46.810
Whatever you do
is what shall be.

1467
01:10:47,977 --> 01:10:48.912
But you're OK if I go?

1468
01:10:49,946 --> 01:10:52.749
- Fine. Go on.
- Bye, Gammy.

1469

Hey, buddy.

01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:23.046
- You got that phone I ordered?
- Yes, it came in. How are you?

1476
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25.349
- Great. You?

1477
01:11:27,116 --> 01:11:28.452
 Hola. 

1478
01:11:29,619 --> 01:11:31.821
Hey, hi.

1479
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:33.323
Remember this?

1480
01:11:34,491 --> 01:11:34.891
- * Relax, don't do it  
- Yes, yes.

1481
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37.126
- Wonderful. Wonderful. Yes.

 * Don't you want to come  

1484
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45.068
Think you made quite
an impression on Ramone.

1485
01:11:46,570 --> 01:11:48.037
Mmm-hmm, I think the part
where I burst into tears

1486
01:11:48,071 --> 01:11:49.773
just really
brought us together.

1487
01:11:49,806 --> 01:11:51.341
- Yeah. Oh, Guess what.
- What?

1488
01:11:51,575 --> 01:11:53.042
Fun fact about Andrew
number eleven:

01:11:53,076 --> 01:11:54.511
- I like Pringles.
- Mm-hmm. OK.

1490
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:55.745
They're delicious.
All Hostess products.

1491
01:11:56,546 --> 01:11:57.547
Coke, never Pepsi,
and beef jerky.

1492
01:11:57,581 --> 01:11:58.815
What, are you,

Thanks, buddy.

1496
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:06.890

Shit. I need
a computer.

1504
01:12:24,574 --> 01:12:25.409
[Tate] Is there,
is there a computer

1505
01:12:26,109 --> 01:12:26.543

[bell jingling]

1507
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:33.049
OK. So when it runs out,
it gives you a warning.

1508
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:34.384
Just put in more dimes.

1509
01:12:35,785 --> 01:12:37.987

You're kidding. Dimes?

1511
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:40.924
- [Margaret] You're not kidding?
- [Andrew] I'll be outside.

1512
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:42.058
- Yell if you need me.
- But what am I supposed...

1513
01:12:43,092 --> 01:12:44.394
[Andrew] You'll be fine.

1514
01:12:44,428 --> 01:12:46.430
[* Niall Toner Band:
 Lonely Souls and Broken 
 Hearts] 

1515
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:50.567
OK, I can figure this out.
I'm an intelligent woman.

1516
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:52.769
Block 'em out, block 'em out,
block 'em out. There you go.

1517
01:12:52,969 --> 01:12:54.538
OK. [clears throat]

1518
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:56.773
- Now.
- [modem beeping, dialing]

1519
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:58.408
What is that?
What is it?

1520
01:12:58,442 --> 01:13:00.410
[tone sounding]

1521
01:13:02,111 --> 01:13:04.981
[Margaret] Um, uh,
excuse me? Excuse me.

1522
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:08.718
[sighs]

1523
01:13:08,752 --> 01:13:09.619
OK.

1524
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14.624
OK. [clears throat]

1525
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:17.093
[exhales deeply]

1526
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:44.921
[Margaret] So, it was nice
to see Gertrude, huh?

1527
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:46.656
Yeah.

1528
01:13:46,690 --> 01:13:48.658
She looked
really pretty today.

1529
01:13:50,126 --> 01:13:52.028
- Yeah, she did.
- Mmm-hmm.

1530
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:56.566
Must be nice to see each other
again and just catch up.

1531
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:58.735
It's definitely good
to see her. It's...

1532
01:13:58,768 --> 01:14:00.436
...definitely, yeah.
It's been a long time.

1533
01:14:02,606 --> 01:14:04.808
Oh, there they are.
There they are. Margaret!

1534
01:14:04,841 --> 01:14:06.009
- [Grammy] Woo!
- [both laughing]

1535
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:07.143
[Grace] We need Margaret.

1536
01:14:07,611 --> 01:14:08.111
Afraid we're
going to have to

1537
01:14:08,845 --> 01:14:09.946
steal you away,
young lady.

1538
01:14:10,914 --> 01:14:11.347
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just gonna keep...

1539
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13.249
No, not to worry.

1540
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:15.585
No strippers, no chanting
in the woods. Promise.

1541
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:17.587
- Oh, well...
- Yeah. Come on.

1542
01:14:17,621 --> 01:14:21.124
But not you. It's girl stuff.
You'd hate it.

1543
01:14:21,157 --> 01:14:23.927
- But...
- Come on.

1544
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25.529
Um, OK. Will I, uh...

1545
01:14:25,562 --> 01:14:27.797
...are these shoes OK
for what we're gonna do?

1546
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:30.900
I can't believe
this is happening.

1547
01:14:32,201 --> 01:14:34.771
My mother made
this dress by hand.

1548
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:38.508
In this very shop.
In 1929.

1549
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:41.678
It's funny how things
come back in style.

1550
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43.647
[Margaret] Just... just
finishing up the buttons.

1551
01:14:43,680 --> 01:14:45.649
Yeah, and don't worry
about the fit

1552
01:14:45,915 --> 01:14:48.518
because Annie is the best
tailor in southeast Alaska.

1553
01:14:48,552 --> 01:14:49.185
Oh... Pssh.

1554
01:14:51,855 --> 01:14:53.823
Wow, incredible.

1555
01:14:53,857 --> 01:14:56.125
Maybe a tad loose in certain
areas, but otherwise...

1556
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:59.896
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit
chesty to begin with

1557
01:14:59,929 --> 01:15:02.732
and I happened to be
knocked up when I wore this.

1558
01:15:02,766 --> 01:15:04.067
- Oh.
- [chuckling]

1559
01:15:04,734 --> 01:15:07.103
Oh, let's see if we
can find your boobs.

1560
01:15:09,573 --> 01:15:12.609
- They're in there somewhere.
- Yes. Yes, they are.

1561
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:14.611
This is like
an Easter egg hunt.

1562
01:15:15,612 --> 01:15:17.814
Maybe they shrunk up
in the cold Alaskan air.

1563
01:15:17,847 --> 01:15:21.017
[all laughing]

1564
01:15:21,050 --> 01:15:24.888
- Oh! There they are.
- That... yes.
That would be...

1565
01:15:24,921 --> 01:15:28.725
- [Grammy] There, let's see.
- I was thinking, if you'd like,

1566
01:15:28,758 --> 01:15:33.196
maybe we could head down your
way for the holidays this year.

1567
01:15:33,597 --> 01:15:35.665
Oh, that would, uh...
that would be nice.

1568
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:40.036
That'd be nice. Or maybe
we could come to you, too.

1569
01:15:40,069 --> 01:15:43.740
- Well, that would be lovely.
- Mmm-hmm.

1570
01:15:43,773 --> 01:15:46.075
I would like that
very much.

1571
01:15:46,109 --> 01:15:48.778
Oh, Grace, for God's sake.
We've got work to do.

1572
01:15:48,812 --> 01:15:51.781
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Go make yourself
a cup of tea.

1573
01:15:51,815 --> 01:15:54.751
I'll finish this. Go.

1574
01:15:54,784 --> 01:16:00.757
Now, let's make this
absolute perfection.

1575
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02.626
[Grammy chuckling]

1576
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:08.064
Now, just one special touch
and you're ready.

1577
01:16:11,968 --> 01:16:16.740
It's been in the family
for more than 150 years.

1578
01:16:16,773 --> 01:16:18.808
Annie, it's beautiful,
but I don't really think...

1579
01:16:18,842 --> 01:16:21.711
- Shh. I'm not finished.
- Oh, sorry.

1580
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:24.981
My great-grandfather gave it
to my great-grandmother

1581
01:16:25,014 --> 01:16:27.651
when they got married.

1582
01:16:27,684 --> 01:16:29.786
They were quite
a scandal, you know.

1583
01:16:29,819 --> 01:16:33.757
He was Russian and she
was Tlingit, and back then

1584
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35.925
you had to get approval
from every member of the tribe

1585
01:16:35,959 --> 01:16:37.794
before you got married.

1586
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:39.095
Almost broke them up.

1587
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:42.131
Well... how did they
stay together then?

1588
01:16:42,165 --> 01:16:44.768
She was a lot like you.
Tough.

1589
01:16:44,801 --> 01:16:47.704
Wouldn't take "no"
for an answer.

1590
01:16:47,937 --> 01:16:51.741
She was good for him.

1591
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:53.677
I want you to have it.

1592
01:16:53,877 --> 01:16:57.146
- I can't. Can't take this.
- I don't want to hear it.

1593
01:16:57,180 --> 01:17:00.684
Grandmothers love
to give their stuff
to their grandchildren.

1594
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:03.720
It makes us feel like we'll
still be part of your lives

1595
01:17:03,753 --> 01:17:04.788
even after
we're gone.

1596
01:17:04,821 --> 01:17:07.056
Take it.

1597
01:17:11,127 --> 01:17:12.195
[clears throat]

1598
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:15.699
Are... are you
all right, dear?

1599
01:17:17,066 --> 01:17:19.769
[exhales deeply] I, uh...

1600
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:24.073
Uh... Well, I, um...

1601
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:32.448
I, uh... I just, uh,
I just wanted to...

1602
01:17:32,481 --> 01:17:35.018
make sure there was enough time
to get all the sewing done.

1603
01:17:35,051 --> 01:17:37.954
[chuckles] Don't you
worry about that.

1604
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:40.423
- You're gonna be beautiful.
- OK.

1605
01:17:40,857 --> 01:17:43.893
- Now let's get you
out of those pins.
- OK.

1606
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03.780
[footsteps approaching]

1607
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:08.417
All right.

1608
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:17.727
This is untied.
Hop on in.

1609
01:18:17,761 --> 01:18:18.762
[grunting]

1610
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:22.732
Hey, hey, hey. Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1611
01:18:23,266 --> 01:18:24.868
Whoa! What...

1612
01:18:24,901 --> 01:18:26.736
Mind telling me
what the hell's wrong?

1613
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:28.772
I just needed to get
away from everybody.

1614
01:18:28,805 --> 01:18:29.973
- What's wrong?
- Nothing! Just stop
talking, please!

1615
01:18:38,948 --> 01:18:41.951
Would you mind telling me
what's happening now?

1616
01:18:41,985 --> 01:18:43.753
Margaret.

1617
01:18:46,122 --> 01:18:48.792
- Margaret!
- I forgot, OK?

1618
01:18:48,825 --> 01:18:50.093
[Andrew]
You forgot what?

1619
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52.728
I forgot what it was
like to have a family!

1620
01:18:52,929 --> 01:18:55.198
I've been on my own
since I was 16

1621
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58.234
and I forgot what it felt
like to have people love you

1622
01:18:58,267 --> 01:19:00.804
and make you breakfast
and say, "Hey!

1623
01:19:00,837 --> 01:19:02.171
We'd love to come down
for the holidays."

1624
01:19:03,439 --> 01:19:05.909
And I say, "Well, why don't we
come up and see you instead?"

1625
01:19:05,942 --> 01:19:08.077
And give you necklaces!
And you have all that here,

1626
01:19:08,111 --> 01:19:10.814
and you have Gertrude, and
I'm... I'm just screwing it up!

1627
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:13.082
You're not screwing it up!
I agreed to this!

1628
01:19:13,116 --> 01:19:13.950
You were there, remember?

1629
01:19:14,818 --> 01:19:15.952
Your family loves you.
Do you know that?

1630
01:19:16,820 --> 01:19:17.453
- I know that! Yes!
- You know that?

1631
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:18.955
And you're still willing
to put them through this?

1632
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:20.023
They're not
gonna find out!

1633
01:19:20,824 --> 01:19:21.424
How do you know
they won't find out?

1634
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:22.926
Because you
said so yourself.

1635
01:19:24,260 --> 01:19:24.961
- I know, but what
if your mother...
- You said so yourself!

1636
01:19:25,829 --> 01:19:25.862
Oh, my God, if your
mother found out...

1637
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:28.231
Whoa! Whoa!

1638
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:29.799
- Oh, my God! What if
Gammy finds out?
- The boat is moving!

1639
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:31.767
If Gammy finds out, she's
gonna have a heart attack!

1640
01:19:31,801 --> 01:19:33.837
Stop! It's gonna be fine!

1641
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35.438
- She's gonna have
a heart attack!
- Will you calm down! Hold on!

1642
01:19:36,505 --> 01:19:38.074
[Andrew] Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

1643
01:19:38,107 --> 01:19:41.811
Whoa! I don't think
that hijacking a boat

1644
01:19:41,845 --> 01:19:45.181
is a proper way to
express your frustration!

1645
01:19:45,214 --> 01:19:46.850
Now... Oh, great.

1646
01:19:46,883 --> 01:19:49.085
Now you decide
to shut up! Margaret?

1647
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:51.454
- [Margaret] Andrew!
- Margaret?

1648
01:19:51,487 --> 01:19:53.923
- [gasping] Andrew!
- Margaret!

1649
01:19:57,994 --> 01:19:58.828
I can't swim!

1650
01:19:58,862 --> 01:20:00.196
Margaret!

1651
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:01.831
[Andrew] To the buoy!

1652
01:20:01,865 --> 01:20:03.867
- What?
- To the buoy!

1653
01:20:04,901 --> 01:20:05.801
OK.

1654
01:20:12,909 --> 01:20:14.944
[gasping]

1655
01:20:19,582 --> 01:20:21.918
All right, come on!
Give me your hand!

1656
01:20:21,951 --> 01:20:24.020
- Hey! Give me your hand!
- [gasping]

1657
01:20:24,053 --> 01:20:26.890
Margaret! Give me...

1658
01:20:26,923 --> 01:20:28.858
Come on,
give me your hand!

1659
01:20:28,892 --> 01:20:29.859
Come on, come on.
I got you. I got you.

1660
01:20:30,927 --> 01:20:32.528
I got you. [grunting]

1661
01:20:33,897 --> 01:20:36.232
- [Margaret gasping, shuddering]
- Come on.

1662
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:38.134
[grunts] What the hell
were you thinking?

1663
01:20:38,167 --> 01:20:39.869
Could've gotten
yourself killed.

1664
01:20:40,069 --> 01:20:43.206
You turned the boat and
made me fall in, you jackass.

1665
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:45.074
You let go of the
steering wheel, Ahab.

1666
01:20:45,108 --> 01:20:47.877
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1667
01:20:47,911 --> 01:20:51.147
All right, come here.
You've got to get warm. Come on.

1668
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:55.952
Come on. It's OK.
[panting]

1669
01:20:55,985 --> 01:20:56.953
It's OK.

1670
01:21:00,589 --> 01:21:01.624
It's OK.

1671
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:35.058
I want to talk
to both of you.

1672
01:21:48,637 --> 01:21:50.974
Your mother is never to
hear about any of this.

1673
01:22:03,186 --> 01:22:05.121
Told you I'd
check up on you.

1674
01:22:07,056 --> 01:22:08.457
What did you do?

1675
01:22:08,491 --> 01:22:10.126
I got a phone call from
Mr. Gilbertson here,

1676
01:22:10,159 --> 01:22:12.495
who told me that
if you were lying,

1677
01:22:12,528 --> 01:22:14.497
and he strongly
believes that you are,

1678
01:22:14,697 --> 01:22:15.999
he would send you
to prison.

1679
01:22:16,032 --> 01:22:18.101
So I flew him up here.

1680
01:22:18,134 --> 01:22:20.603
- Dad.
- Luckily for you,

1681
01:22:20,636 --> 01:22:23.539
your father negotiated
a deal on your behalf.

1682
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:26.742
[Gilbertson] Now, this offer's
gonna last for 20 seconds,

1683
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28.511
so listen closely.

1684
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:29.712
You're gonna
make a statement

1685
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:31.480
admitting this
marriage is a sham...

1686
01:22:31,514 --> 01:22:33.082
...or you're gonna
go to prison.

1687
01:22:33,116 --> 01:22:35.118
You tell the truth,
you're off the hook,

1688
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:37.453
and she is going to
go back to Canada.

1689
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:46.162
Ah, well.
Take the deal.

1690
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:50.533
- I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid, Andrew.

1691
01:22:50,566 --> 01:22:52.535
You want a statement?
Here's your statement.

1692
01:22:52,735 --> 01:22:53.736
I've been working for
Margaret Tate for three years.

1693
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56.439
Six months ago we started
dating, we fell in love.

1694
01:22:56,472 --> 01:22:58.141
I asked her to marry me,
she said "yes."

1695
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:00.476
I'll see you
at the wedding.

1696
01:23:11,087 --> 01:23:12.421
Well, you know.

1697
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:38.081
So...

1698
01:23:38,114 --> 01:23:40.683
...you sure
about this?

1699
01:23:40,716 --> 01:23:42.017
Not really.

1700
01:23:46,155 --> 01:23:48.724
I mean, I am very appreciative
of what you've done,

1701
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50.193
but I think that...

1702
01:23:50,226 --> 01:23:51.194
You'd do
the same for me.

1703
01:23:51,227 --> 01:23:52.561
Right?

1704
01:23:54,463 --> 01:23:56.565
- [knocking]
- Hope everyone is decent.

1705
01:23:56,599 --> 01:23:58.067
You need to come
with me.

1706
01:23:58,101 --> 01:24:00.103
[Grammy] Now, tomorrow
is your wedding day.

1707
01:24:00,136 --> 01:24:01.437
You have to give the
Baby Maker a rest tonight.

1708
01:24:01,470 --> 01:24:03.539
It's tradition.

1709
01:24:03,572 --> 01:24:05.174
- Give your bride
a kiss good night.
- We're not gonna...

1710
01:24:05,208 --> 01:24:07.076
...use the Baby Maker.

1711
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:08.444
[Grammy] You've got your whole
lives to be together.

1712
01:24:08,644 --> 01:24:11.147
- [Andrew] OK.
- Now, come on. Come on.

1713
01:24:16,752 --> 01:24:18.587
[sighs]

1714
01:24:18,621 --> 01:24:19.722
If I don't go with her,
she's just gonna...

1715
01:24:20,156 --> 01:24:23.492
- Come right back.
- Yeah.

1716
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:31.834
See you in the morning?

1717
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34.437
Yeah.

1718
01:24:47,216 --> 01:24:50.153
[indistinct chatter from TV]

1719
01:25:32,661 --> 01:25:34.129
[crowd chattering]

1720
01:25:37,233 --> 01:25:38.401
Hey, Gammy.

1721
01:25:40,203 --> 01:25:42.171
- Thanks, Gammy.
- Oh.

1722
01:25:47,743 --> 01:25:50.246
[* Pachelbel: Canon in D plays]

1723
01:26:50,439 --> 01:26:51.740
[music ends]

1724
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:53.309
[Ramone] Everyone,
please be seated.

1725
01:26:59,315 --> 01:27:00.283
Ramone.

1726
01:27:01,317 --> 01:27:02.551
[speaks foreign language]

1727
01:27:04,553 --> 01:27:08.891
We are gathered here
today to give thanks...

1728
01:27:09,992 --> 01:27:12.695
...and to celebrate...

1729
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:15.264
...one of life's
greatest moments.

1730
01:27:15,298 --> 01:27:17.266
[Ramone] To give recognition

1731
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:21.870
to the beauty, honesty,
and unselfish ways

1732
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:24.773
of Andrew and
Margaret's true love

1733
01:27:24,807 --> 01:27:27.476
in front of
family and friends.

1734
01:27:27,510 --> 01:27:30.346
For it is their family
and friends.

1735
01:27:30,379 --> 01:27:34.750
who taught Andrew
and Margaret to love.

1736
01:27:34,783 --> 01:27:39.322
So it is only right that
family and friends are all...

1737
01:27:42,791 --> 01:27:44.860
 Mi amor. Do you
have a question?

1738
01:27:45,694 --> 01:27:47.896
Uh, no...

1739
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49.432
Your hand is up.

1740
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:56.071
Oh, it, it's, uh,
not a question,

1741
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58.374
but I do have something
I need to say.

1742
01:27:58,407 --> 01:28:02.311
- Margaret.
- Can it wait till after?

1743
01:28:02,345 --> 01:28:06.782
Uh... No. No.

1744
01:28:16,725 --> 01:28:18.461
[sighs]

1745
01:28:18,494 --> 01:28:22.097
- [clears throat] Hi there.
- [all murmur] Hi.

1746
01:28:22,130 --> 01:28:24.500
Thank you all so much
for coming out.

1747
01:28:24,533 --> 01:28:27.503
[Margaret] I, uh... have
a bit of an announcement

1748
01:28:27,536 --> 01:28:29.572
to make about
the wedding.

1749
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:33.041
- A confession, actually.
- What are you doing?

1750
01:28:33,075 --> 01:28:36.612
Uh... I'm a Canadian.
Yes, Canadian.

1751
01:28:36,645 --> 01:28:40.783
With an expired visa
who was about to be deported.

1752
01:28:40,816 --> 01:28:42.518
And because I didn't
want to leave

1753
01:28:42,551 --> 01:28:44.820
this wonderful
country of yours,

1754
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:47.790
I forced Andrew here
to marry me.

1755
01:28:47,823 --> 01:28:49.692
Margaret, stop it.

1756
01:28:49,725 --> 01:28:52.995
See, Andrew has always had
this extraordinary work ethic.

1757
01:28:54,763 --> 01:28:56.399
Something I think
he learned from you.

1758
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59.735
And for three years I
watched him work harder

1759
01:28:59,768 --> 01:29:01.737
than anyone else
at our company.

1760
01:29:01,770 --> 01:29:05.040
And I knew that if I threatened
to destroy his career...

1761
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:08.043
...he would, he would do
just about anything.

1762
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:15.618
So I blackmailed him to
come up here and to lie to you.

1763
01:29:18,020 --> 01:29:21.056
[Margaret] All of you.

1764
01:29:21,089 --> 01:29:23.692
And I thought it would
be easy to watch him do it.

1765
01:29:23,726 --> 01:29:25.828
[clears throat]

1766
01:29:25,861 --> 01:29:27.129
But it wasn't.

1767
01:29:30,599 --> 01:29:32.568
Turns out it's not easy
to ruin someone's life

1768
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:34.937
once you find out
how wonderful they are.

1769
01:29:36,605 --> 01:29:37.940
[crowd murmurs]

1770
01:29:41,477 --> 01:29:43.546
You have
a beautiful family.

1771
01:29:45,581 --> 01:29:47.450
[Margaret] Don't let this
come between you.

1772
01:29:50,453 --> 01:29:52.721
This was my fault.

1773
01:29:52,755 --> 01:29:54.523
Margaret...

1774
01:29:54,557 --> 01:29:56.559
Andrew, this was
a business deal,

1775
01:29:56,592 --> 01:30:00.463
and you held up your end,
but now the deal is off.

1776
01:30:01,764 --> 01:30:02.898
I'm sorry.

1777
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:05.934
And, you,
meet me at the dock.

1778
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:07.970
You're giving me
a ride to the airport.

1779
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:15.611
[crowd chattering]

1780
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:22.851
[snorts]

1781
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:27.155
- What were you thinking?
- I don't, I don't know.

1782
01:30:27,189 --> 01:30:29.124
Andrew,
you lied to us.

1783
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:30.726
Let me get my head
on straight, OK?

1784
01:30:30,759 --> 01:30:31.660
I'll explain
everything later.

1785
01:30:31,694 --> 01:30:34.096
I'm sorry.

1786
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:14.603
 [Margaret] You were right. 
 This book is special. 

1787
01:31:14,637 --> 01:31:16.138
 I lied because I knew 
 publishing meant 

1788
01:31:16,171 --> 01:31:17.706
 I'd lose you 
 as an assistant 

1789
01:31:18,073 --> 01:31:19.808
 but... you have 
 an extraordinary eye, 

1790
01:31:19,842 --> 01:31:22.945
 and I'll make sure we 
 buy this before I leave. 

1791
01:31:22,978 --> 01:31:26.915
 Have an amazing life. 
 You deserve it. Margaret. 

1792
01:31:29,184 --> 01:31:32.555
Well, that was, uh...
crazy.

1793
01:31:32,588 --> 01:31:33.989
[snorts]

1794
01:31:34,022 --> 01:31:36.091
You know, people are gonna be
talking about this forever.

1795
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:39.695
Yeah. Yeah.

1796
01:31:41,564 --> 01:31:42.497
Are you OK?

1797
01:31:43,866 --> 01:31:46.602
Yeah. No. Uh...

1798
01:31:49,004 --> 01:31:52.908
I just feel. You know
what the problem is?

1799
01:31:52,941 --> 01:31:56.178
The problem is
that this woman...

1800
01:31:56,211 --> 01:31:59.882
...is a gigantic
pain in my ass.

1801
01:31:59,915 --> 01:32:02.718
First there's the whole leaving
thing. I understand that.

1802
01:32:02,751 --> 01:32:05.053
It's a sham wedding.
It was kind of stressful.

1803
01:32:05,087 --> 01:32:08.090
But then she goes ahead
and she leaves this note.

1804
01:32:08,123 --> 01:32:10.025
Because she doesn't
have the decency...

1805
01:32:10,058 --> 01:32:12.227
the humanity
to do it to my face.

1806
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:17.566
Three years. Three years
I work with this...
this terrorist.

1807
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:19.101
Never once has she had
a nice thing to say,

1808
01:32:19,768 --> 01:32:20.903
and then she goes ahead
and she writes this crap!

1809
01:32:21,136 --> 01:32:22.738
- Andrew.
- But none of that matters

1810
01:32:22,771 --> 01:32:24.072
because we had a deal!

1811
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:28.243
- Andrew.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

1812
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:29.044
She just makes me
a little crazy.

1813
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:32.915
[Gert chuckles]
Yeah. I can see that.

1814
01:32:32,948 --> 01:32:36.819
So you're just
gonna let her go?

1815
01:32:50,132 --> 01:32:52.668
So, what now?

1816
01:32:52,701 --> 01:32:54.970
[Gilbertson] Well... now that
you're leaving voluntarily,

1817
01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:58.073
it all becomes
very civilized.

1818
01:32:58,106 --> 01:33:00.743
Once we land in New York,
you have 24 hours

1819
01:33:00,776 --> 01:33:03.746
to head back to Canada.

1820
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:13.756
- Andrew, what's happening?
- I got to talk to her.

1821
01:33:13,789 --> 01:33:14.857
- Why would you do that?
- Boys!

1822
01:33:15,190 --> 01:33:15.658
This has nothing
to do with you.

1823
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:17.025
Boys, stop it! Stop it!

1824
01:33:17,893 --> 01:33:18.661
[Joe] I'm not gonna
let you do this.

1825
01:33:19,695 --> 01:33:19.728
[Andrew] I'm not asking
your permission here.

1826
01:33:20,462 --> 01:33:22.965
- [gasps]
- Annie! Joe! Joe!

1827
01:33:22,998 --> 01:33:26.234
Annie! Joe!

1828
01:33:26,268 --> 01:33:29.772
I think I'm having
a heart attack.

1829
01:33:29,805 --> 01:33:31.006
- Easy. Easy.
- Somebody get a doctor!

1830
01:33:31,740 --> 01:33:32.607
- Easy, easy.
- [man] Get a doctor!

1831
01:33:36,779 --> 01:33:37.713
I got it.

1832
01:34:06,842 --> 01:34:08.076
Andrew.

1833
01:34:10,879 --> 01:34:14.683
You two need to
stop fighting.

1834
01:34:14,717 --> 01:34:16.752
[Grammy] You'll never
see eye to eye.

1835
01:34:18,153 --> 01:34:21.790
But you're family.

1836
01:34:25,227 --> 01:34:30.065
Promise me you'll
stand by Andrew.

1837
01:34:30,098 --> 01:34:32.768
Even if... if you don't
agree with him.

1838
01:34:35,270 --> 01:34:36.739
I promise.

1839
01:34:38,741 --> 01:34:41.043
Andrew.

1840
01:34:41,243 --> 01:34:46.882
Promise me you'll work harder
to be a part of this family.

1841
01:34:46,915 --> 01:34:48.917
I will.

1842
01:34:51,954 --> 01:34:54.489
[Andrew] I will, Gammy.

1843
01:34:54,522 --> 01:34:59.895
Well, then,
the spirits can take me.

1844
01:34:59,928 --> 01:35:01.730
Oh, Annie.

1845
01:35:08,470 --> 01:35:09.938
Gammy?

1846
01:35:16,812 --> 01:35:18.046
I guess they're
not ready for me.

1847
01:35:18,246 --> 01:35:21.750
I'm feeling
much better, sonny.

1848
01:35:21,784 --> 01:35:22.985
[Gammy] No need to
take us to the hospital.

1849
01:35:23,218 --> 01:35:25.053
Take us to
the airport, please.

1850
01:35:25,087 --> 01:35:26.955
Mom, what? Are you faking
the heart attack?

1851
01:35:26,989 --> 01:35:28.456
- Oh, come on!
- [laughing]

1852
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30.158
Well, it was the only
way I could get you two

1853
01:35:31,026 --> 01:35:32.327
to shut up and
get us to the airport!

1854
01:35:32,360 --> 01:35:34.897
[man] Ma'am, we're not
authorized to take you
to the airport.

1855
01:35:35,563 --> 01:35:37.766
Larry Ferris, don't
make me call your mother.

1856
01:35:37,800 --> 01:35:39.802
[Larry] You got it.

1857
01:35:41,937 --> 01:35:43.772
[sighs] You scared
the hell out of me.

1858
01:35:49,144 --> 01:35:52.981
Yep. You should've
given up back in New York.

1859
01:35:53,015 --> 01:35:56.484
See, I'm like Eliot Ness.

1860
01:35:56,518 --> 01:35:59.487
I always get my man.

1861
01:35:59,521 --> 01:36:02.791
I'm that good.

1862
01:36:02,825 --> 01:36:04.827
Flight 1601, as soon
as you're in position,

1863
01:36:04,860 --> 01:36:06.561
you're cleared
for takeoff.

1864
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:06.995
 [man on radio] 
 Roger that, Chuck. 

1865
01:36:15,603 --> 01:36:17.105
OK. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1866
01:36:20,475 --> 01:36:23.145
- [phone ringing]
- [chortles]

1867
01:36:23,178 --> 01:36:25.080
Tower. Talk to me.

1868
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:27.249
- Chuck! It's Drew Paxton.
- Hey, dude. 

1869
01:36:27,282 --> 01:36:30.085
Hey, uh... I have a little
favor I need from you, buddy...

1870
01:36:30,118 --> 01:36:31.987
Margaret's on that plane. I got
to talk to her. Can you stop it?

1871
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:33.856
 [Chuck] Oh, yeah! 

1872
01:36:33,889 --> 01:36:35.490
I heard about
your lady bailin'.

1873
01:36:35,891 --> 01:36:38.193
- Drag-ola. [laughs]
- [Andrew] Chuck! I need you 

1874
01:36:38,626 --> 01:36:40.095
to stop the plane.
Please.

1875
01:36:40,128 --> 01:36:42.998
 I can't do that. [laughing] 

1876
01:36:43,031 --> 01:36:46.068
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! Come on!

1877
01:36:47,035 --> 01:36:48.403
Oh, no.

1878
01:36:50,939 --> 01:36:52.140
No!

1879
01:36:54,242 --> 01:36:56.178
- What's wrong?
- Margaret's on that plane.

1880
01:36:56,578 --> 01:36:58.180
- And he didn't get to tell her.
- Tell her what?

1881
01:36:58,213 --> 01:36:59.882
That he loves her.

1882
01:36:59,915 --> 01:37:02.985
So she could tell him
that she loves him, too.

1883
01:37:03,018 --> 01:37:04.086
OK, but how does he...

1884
01:37:05,087 --> 01:37:05.487
If she didn't love him,
she wouldn't have left.

1885
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:06.354
Of course not.

1886
01:37:06,388 --> 01:37:08.590
Am I the only one
not getting this?

1887
01:37:09,024 --> 01:37:12.194
- Oh, Joe!
- Chuck! Chuck! Look down.

1888
01:37:12,227 --> 01:37:13.862
Oh! Oh. Look down.

1889
01:37:14,062 --> 01:37:16.464
 [Chuck on radio] 
 Like... Oh, there you are! 

1890
01:37:16,498 --> 01:37:18.100
 Sorry, man. There was 
 nothing I could do. 

1891
01:37:20,168 --> 01:37:21.904
Thanks, Chuck.

1892
01:37:25,073 --> 01:37:29.077
I'm sorry, son. I didn't
know how you felt about her.

1893
01:37:34,582 --> 01:37:35.951
[Grace] Honey,
it's gonna be OK.

1894
01:37:55,003 --> 01:37:56.438
[phone ringing]

1895
01:38:09,617 --> 01:38:10.919
Jordan?

1896
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26.468
[clears throat]

1897
01:38:29,471 --> 01:38:30.138
Jordan.

1898
01:38:31,739 --> 01:38:33.541
Jordan!

1899
01:38:33,575 --> 01:38:36.578
I need for you to send
the boxes in my office to...

1900
01:38:36,611 --> 01:38:38.580
...to this address, please.

1901
01:38:38,613 --> 01:38:42.650
This one right here.
This address right here. OK?

1902
01:38:42,684 --> 01:38:45.187
- Can you do that?
- Uh, yes. Sure.

1903
01:38:45,620 --> 01:38:46.921
- Good, all right. Thank you.
- Miss Tate.

1904
01:38:47,122 --> 01:38:50.192
Yes. What? What?

1905
01:38:52,127 --> 01:38:55.430
[panting] Hey.

1906
01:38:57,132 --> 01:38:59.467
Andrew.

1907
01:39:03,538 --> 01:39:06.108
Why are, why are
you panting?

1908
01:39:06,141 --> 01:39:08.443
Because I've
been running.

1909
01:39:08,476 --> 01:39:11.113
- Really. From Alaska?
- I need to talk to you.

1910
01:39:11,513 --> 01:39:13.015
Yeah? Well, I don't
have time to talk.

1911
01:39:13,048 --> 01:39:15.483
I need to catch
a 5:45 to Toronto.

1912
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:16.985
- Margaret.
- I need the boxes
to go out today.

1913
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:17.952
I want to make sure
everything is...

1914
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20.455
Margaret! Stop talking!

1915
01:39:22,190 --> 01:39:24.459
[all gasp]

1916
01:39:24,492 --> 01:39:26.061
[Andrew] I'm gonna
say something.

1917
01:39:26,628 --> 01:39:27.762
- [whispering] OK.
- This will just take a sec.

1918
01:39:27,795 --> 01:39:29.464
Fine. What?

1919
01:39:30,665 --> 01:39:35.503
Three days ago,
I loathed you.

1920
01:39:35,537 --> 01:39:37.472
I used to dream about you
getting hit by a cab.

1921
01:39:37,505 --> 01:39:39.041
Or poisoned.

1922
01:39:39,074 --> 01:39:42.544
- Oh, that's nice.
- I told you to stop talking.

1923
01:39:42,577 --> 01:39:45.147
Then we had our little
adventure up in Alaska

1924
01:39:45,180 --> 01:39:47.549
and things
started to change.

1925
01:39:47,582 --> 01:39:50.152
Things changed
when we kissed.

1926
01:39:52,187 --> 01:39:54.122
And when you told me
about your tattoo.

1927
01:39:57,092 --> 01:39:59.061
Even when you checked me
out when we were naked.

1928
01:39:59,094 --> 01:40:00.195
- [all murmuring]
- [woman] Uh-huuuh.

1929
01:40:00,228 --> 01:40:01.563
Naked?

1930
01:40:01,596 --> 01:40:03.498
Well, I didn't
see anything...

1931
01:40:03,531 --> 01:40:05.100
[Andrew] Yeah, you did.

1932
01:40:05,733 --> 01:40:09.204
But I didn't realize any of
this until I was standing alone.

1933
01:40:09,237 --> 01:40:13.041
in a barn... wife-less.

1934
01:40:13,075 --> 01:40:15.677
Now, you can imagine
my disappointment

1935
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17.412
when it suddenly
dawned on me

1936
01:40:18,113 --> 01:40:21.516
that the woman I love is about
to be kicked out of the country.

1937
01:40:24,252 --> 01:40:25.753
So, Margaret.

1938
01:40:28,256 --> 01:40:29.424
Marry me.

1939
01:40:32,794 --> 01:40:35.197
Because I'd like
to date you.

1940
01:40:47,609 --> 01:40:50.778
Trust me. You don't really
want to be with me.

1941
01:40:50,812 --> 01:40:52.580
Yes, I do.

1942
01:40:54,482 --> 01:40:57.119
See, the thing is,
there is a reason why

1943
01:40:57,152 --> 01:41:00.122
I've been alone
all this time.

1944
01:41:00,155 --> 01:41:02.224
I'm comfortable
that way.

1945
01:41:02,257 --> 01:41:04.092
And I think it would
just be a lot easier

1946
01:41:04,126 --> 01:41:10.132
if we forgot everything
that happened and I just left.

1947
01:41:11,799 --> 01:41:13.501
You're right.

1948
01:41:19,141 --> 01:41:21.576
That would be easier.

1949
01:41:37,259 --> 01:41:40.628
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.

1950
01:41:44,199 --> 01:41:46.434
[crowd murmurs]

1951
01:42:04,886 --> 01:42:07.655
Aren't you supposed to get down
on your knee or something?

1952
01:42:07,855 --> 01:42:09.291
I'm gonna take
that as a "yes."

1953
01:42:09,324 --> 01:42:11.193
Oh, OK.

1954
01:42:14,362 --> 01:42:16.531
[crowd chattering]

1955
01:42:25,873 --> 01:42:28.710
[man] Yeah! Show her
who's boss, Andrew!

1956
01:42:28,743 --> 01:42:30.144
[laughter]

1957
01:42:31,746 --> 01:42:33.648
[clapping]

1958
01:42:36,918 --> 01:42:40.488
[Gilbertson] So, let me see
if I've got this right.

1959
01:42:40,522 --> 01:42:43.258
You two are
engaged again.

1960
01:42:43,291 --> 01:42:44.526
- [Andrew] Yes.
- [Margaret] Yes.

1961
01:42:44,559 --> 01:42:46.594
For real?

1962
01:42:47,762 --> 01:42:48.830
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1963
01:42:49,864 --> 01:42:49.897
You're sure you want to
go through with this?

1964
01:42:51,233 --> 01:42:51.266
Because one
wrong answer...

1965
01:42:51,933 --> 01:42:54.436
I'm gonna
take you down.

1966
01:42:56,871 --> 01:42:59.441
- OK.
- OK.

1967
01:43:00,942 --> 01:43:02.444
Let's do it.

1968
01:43:02,677 --> 01:43:03.811
[* Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock:
 It Takes Two] 

1969
01:43:03,845 --> 01:43:05.480
 * Hit it  

1970
01:43:05,513 --> 01:43:09.284
 * Whoo! Yeah! 
 Whoo! Yeah * 

1971
01:43:09,317 --> 01:43:11.819
 * Whoo! Yeah! Whoo!  

1972
01:43:11,853 --> 01:43:13.355
[Gilbertson] When did you
first start to date?

1973
01:43:13,388 --> 01:43:15.223
Last week.

1974
01:43:15,257 --> 01:43:18.760
- [Gilbertson] That going well?
- So far it's great. Thank you.

1975
01:43:18,793 --> 01:43:19.927
[Gilbertson] What kind of
deodorant does Andrew use?

1976
01:43:19,961 --> 01:43:21.663
Men's Speed Stick?

1977
01:43:21,696 --> 01:43:24.999
[Gilbertson] What flavor?
Musk? Alpine?

1978
01:43:25,032 --> 01:43:26.301
Was it love
at first sight?

1979
01:43:26,334 --> 01:43:28.536
[inhales] No.

1980
01:43:28,570 --> 01:43:32.574
I loved her
from the beginning.

1981
01:43:32,607 --> 01:43:33.575
[Gilbertson] What side of the
bed does Margaret sleep on?

1982
01:43:34,041 --> 01:43:35.410
She sleeps
on the left.

1983
01:43:35,443 --> 01:43:36.644
What side of the bed
do you sleep on?

1984
01:43:38,980 --> 01:43:43.285
Look, are they
soul mates? Eeeh.

1985
01:43:43,318 --> 01:43:45.953
Uh... Will they
kill each other? No.

1986
01:43:45,987 --> 01:43:46.754
[Gilbertson] Are you
a good driver?

1987
01:43:47,489 --> 01:43:49.624
Oh, excellent driver.
Excellent.

1988
01:43:49,657 --> 01:43:53.528
[makes crashing,
screaming, siren sounds]

1989
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:56.264
Oh.

1990
01:43:56,298 --> 01:43:59.267
In my mind I see her
with someone perhaps...

1991
01:43:59,301 --> 01:44:00.902
...more swarthy,
darker.

1992
01:44:00,935 --> 01:44:03.571
We don't use the word
"Margaret" around Kevin.

1993
01:44:03,605 --> 01:44:07.975
He still hasn't
warmed up to her.

1994
01:44:08,009 --> 01:44:09.744
- Margaret.
- [barks]

1995
01:44:09,777 --> 01:44:11.646
- Margaret.
- [barks]

1996
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:13.448
See? It's the
damnedest thing.

1997
01:44:13,481 --> 01:44:15.417
I have never farted
in front of him.

1998
01:44:15,450 --> 01:44:17.585
Nor will I ever
fart in front of him.

1999
01:44:17,619 --> 01:44:20.355
She farts in her sleep.

2000
01:44:20,388 --> 01:44:22.357
[Gilbertson] Would you consider
Margaret a good dancer?

2001
01:44:22,624 --> 01:44:25.360
You can tell by the way
she drinks her soda pop

2002
01:44:25,393 --> 01:44:27.629
that she's
a good dancer.

2003
01:44:27,662 --> 01:44:28.830
[Gilbertson] Uh-huh.
How, how...

2004
01:44:29,497 --> 01:44:33.435
How is the soda pop
relevant to the dancing?

2005
01:44:33,468 --> 01:44:35.437
I don't understand this.

2006
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:37.972
- I call him... puppy.
- Pumpkin.

2007
01:44:38,005 --> 01:44:39.907
- Monkey.
- Daisy.

2008
01:44:39,941 --> 01:44:42.310
- Kiddo.
- Uh... Bird.

2009
01:44:42,344 --> 01:44:45.380
Sometimes
I call him Rick.

2010
01:44:45,413 --> 01:44:46.781
[Gilbertson] How do
you spell "Ramone?"

2011
01:44:47,014 --> 01:44:49.651
[thickly accented]
R-A-M-O-N-E.

2012
01:44:49,684 --> 01:44:51.486
[Gilbertson] Could you do that
again in English, please?

2013
01:44:53,054 --> 01:44:54.522
When you say, you know, the
position in the relationship...

2014
01:44:54,722 --> 01:44:56.023
[Gilbertson]
Top or bottom?

2015
01:44:56,524 --> 01:44:59.093
You're asking me a question
about who's on top?

2016
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:00.795
[Gilbertson] You took an oath
when you walked in this office.

2017
01:45:01,563 --> 01:45:03.465
I did not take an oath.
When did I take an oath?

2018
01:45:03,498 --> 01:45:04.666
[Gilbertson] Laura should've
done that, but she didn't.

2019
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:06.300
- That's OK.
- Who's Laura?

2020
01:45:06,334 --> 01:45:08.870
She's the girl behind you.
Don't look around.

2021
01:45:08,903 --> 01:45:10.037
[Gilbertson] Which of
the following numbers

2022
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:12.940
- is not a prime?
- Seventeen.

2023
01:45:12,974 --> 01:45:14.976
I'm sorry. Let me
say the list, please.

2024
01:45:15,009 --> 01:45:16.411
I'm sorry?

2025
01:45:16,444 --> 01:45:17.512
[Gilbertson] He knew
your favorite color.

2026
01:45:18,380 --> 01:45:19.046
- Blue?
- [Gilbertson] Wrong!

2027
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20.715
- Red?
- No!

2028
01:45:20,748 --> 01:45:22.049
Dark... Maybe
like a hunter green?

2029
01:45:22,083 --> 01:45:23.718
[Gilbertson] No. White.

2030
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:24.886
- White?
- OK, moving on.

2031
01:45:24,919 --> 01:45:26.654
Favorite color is blue.

2032
01:45:26,688 --> 01:45:30.425
What's her favorite color
when she's not at home?

2033
01:45:30,458 --> 01:45:31.893
I don't know.

2034
01:45:32,093 --> 01:45:33.695
[Gilbertson] Are you a citizen
of this country, Ramone?

2035
01:45:34,028 --> 01:45:37.565
Yes, I'm a citizen!
[guffawing] Are you crazy?

2036
01:45:37,599 --> 01:45:39.567
[laughs]

2037
01:45:39,601 --> 01:45:42.470
What relevance
a ball in a net

2038
01:45:42,504 --> 01:45:44.472
or a Fruit Roll-Up
or a Pop-Tart

2039
01:45:44,506 --> 01:45:47.141
has to do with my
relationship with Andrew?

2040
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:48.576
[Gilbertson] If you're
getting excited...

2041
01:45:48,943 --> 01:45:51.879
- Who are you engaged to?
- [sighs]

2042
01:45:51,913 --> 01:45:56.050
- Andrew.
- Very good. Got one right.

2043
01:45:56,083 --> 01:45:57.385
[Gilbertson]
Who are you engaged to?

2044
01:45:57,619 --> 01:45:59.153
I'm engaged
to Margaret Tate.

2045
01:45:59,186 --> 01:46:04.426
And on the wedding day,
who will be next to you?

2046
01:46:04,626 --> 01:46:06.861
I'm going to marry
Margaret Tate.

2047
01:46:06,894 --> 01:46:09.564
- [Gilbertson] Final answer?
- That work? Yeah, final answer.

2048
01:46:09,597 --> 01:46:12.900
Is this a game show?
I don't understand what...

2049
01:46:12,934 --> 01:46:16.571
 * God bless America  

2050
01:46:16,604 --> 01:46:19.941
 * Lands that I love  

2051
01:46:19,974 --> 01:46:21.543
That's a great song.

2052
01:46:21,809 --> 01:46:23.077
[Gilbertson] That was beautiful.
That was really beautiful.

2053
01:46:23,110 --> 01:46:24.946
Mama Cass.

2054
01:46:24,979 --> 01:46:27.048
 * Whoo! Yeah!  

2055
01:46:27,081 --> 01:46:29.451
 * It takes two to make 
 a thing go right * 

2056
01:46:31,553 --> 01:46:33.421
 * It takes two to 
 make it out of sight * 

2057
01:46:35,757 --> 01:46:37.592
 * It takes two to make

2058

 * Right now, E-Z Rock now  

2060
01:46:45,767 --> 01:46:47.068
 * When I count to three 
 I want you to get busy * 

2061
01:46:47,469 --> 01:46:48.169
 * You ready now?  

2062
01:46:49,103 --> 01:46:49.837
