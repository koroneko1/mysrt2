WEBVTT

00:31.800 --> 00:34.064
My child, my baby.

00:36.005 --> 00:37.836
Finally inside me.

00:38.140 --> 00:39.869
Nobody is gonna take him from me.

00:41.844 --> 00:43.744
Nobody can hurt him now.

00:44.946 --> 00:46.436
Nobody.

02:04.356 --> 02:06.085
Matthew.

04:43.976 --> 04:51.177
'INSIDE'

05:00.958 --> 05:05.054
FOUR MONTHS LATER

05:05.596 --> 05:07.257
She's better now.

05:11.735 --> 05:13.362
So, Sarah...

05:13.970 --> 05:16.336
Have you picked a name for the baby yet?

05:20.177 --> 05:22.907
All right, We'll be expecting you
tomorrow, at 7.

05:23.947 --> 05:27.144
If nothing happens during the night,
we can induce the labor.

05:28.652 --> 05:31.212
Don't worry, Sarah.
Everything is going to be fine.

05:35.958 --> 05:38.586
Is there someone that could bring you
tomorrow morning?

05:39.361 --> 05:43.798
Normally, we have an ambulance,
But on Christmas eve, maybe...

05:43.999 --> 05:46.024
Yes, someone will bring me here.

05:47.169 --> 05:48.636
Great.

05:49.505 --> 05:51.336
Thank you, doctor. See you tomorrow.

05:51.774 --> 05:53.036
Alright.

05:53.275 --> 05:55.903
Enjoy your last peaceful night.

06:13.595 --> 06:15.620
It won't last long.

06:18.633 --> 06:20.601
I had four children.

06:24.705 --> 06:26.400
I bet it's your first.

06:29.409 --> 06:31.343
The first is terrible.

06:33.013 --> 06:38.349
In my case, it took thirteen hours
for my first to be born.

06:44.858 --> 06:48.657
It sucks. I mean it,
I suffered the worst pain ever.

06:56.736 --> 07:00.399
He made me go through all that,
but was born dead.

07:03.142 --> 07:05.838
You know you can't smoke here.

07:17.355 --> 07:19.880
Everyone around here is a pain in the ass.

07:21.159 --> 07:22.786
Too bad.

07:42.713 --> 07:45.841
I must say, after all you've been through,
you shouldn't be working.

07:46.050 --> 07:48.746
There's no reason to worry,
just a few burning cars.

07:49.153 --> 07:52.020
I'd feel better with you at home,
not taking pictures of riots.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.780
I'll be less paranoid.

07:57.728 --> 08:01.026
Jean-Pierre looks decent.
Have you ever...

08:01.230 --> 08:02.754
He's my boss.

08:04.367 --> 08:06.130
What a shame.

08:06.436 --> 08:09.269
I was hoping to be introduced
one of these days, you know?

08:12.709 --> 08:15.769
So, what do you want to do?

08:17.213 --> 08:20.148
Christmas dinner at my place
or yours?

08:20.617 --> 08:22.608
I'm not hungry, Louise.

08:23.186 --> 08:24.778
I'm really full.

08:30.592 --> 08:32.492
It's going to be alright now.

08:34.062 --> 08:36.360
Listen, I want to be alone, Louise.

08:37.199 --> 08:39.133
Go home, please.

09:42.327 --> 09:43.692
Hello?

09:45.964 --> 09:47.329
What?

09:48.467 --> 09:50.867
I don't give a damn
if he wants headlines.

09:51.170 --> 09:53.730
I don't give a crap!
You can tell him that.

09:55.774 --> 10:00.108
Exactly. So you deal with it.
Explain that to him.

10:00.713 --> 10:03.203
It's 'Burning cars and
total chaos' on the frontpage.

10:03.414 --> 10:05.712
That's my headline, end of conversation.
Thank you.

10:06.784 --> 10:09.082
Ok. No, nothing.

10:09.554 --> 10:11.385
Alright, see you soon.
Merry Christmas.

10:17.595 --> 10:19.256
That bastard...

10:20.364 --> 10:22.127
pisses me off.

10:22.366 --> 10:25.665
The suburbs are burning down
and there's no one there to cover it.

10:28.705 --> 10:30.536
And you, darling, how are you feeling?

10:34.511 --> 10:36.638
It's been hard wihout you there.

10:36.847 --> 10:39.714
They're just a bunch of
bored kids having fun.

10:41.084 --> 10:43.951
Well, there are cars on fire,
the cops are on their toes...

10:44.154 --> 10:47.351
My reporters are idiots.
So much for a Merry Christmas, huh?

10:58.167 --> 11:00.260
Be at my house, 6am sharp?

11:00.703 --> 11:02.227
Really?

11:02.838 --> 11:04.772
I think I better...

11:05.174 --> 11:08.666
Shorten my Christmas Eve,
so I don't keep the lady waiting.

11:12.915 --> 11:14.405
What about you?

11:15.517 --> 11:17.849
Will you be with your mom tonight?

11:18.219 --> 11:21.655
I couldn't care less for this Christmas.
I rather be alone tonight.

11:24.459 --> 11:27.656
You won't say it again next year.
I can guarantee you that.

12:17.877 --> 12:21.142
No, Louise,
you don't need to come tomorrow.

12:23.082 --> 12:25.209
I've told you I'm well enough alone.

12:25.651 --> 12:27.743
We have discussed that already.

12:31.857 --> 12:33.916
Then you'll come on Monday.

12:36.061 --> 12:40.054
No. Jean-Pierre will pick me up.
We just decided it.

12:41.967 --> 12:43.696
I gave him the keys.

12:50.542 --> 12:52.532
No, I'm full.
I'm going to lay down.

15:15.214 --> 15:16.613
Dammit.

16:42.030 --> 16:43.554
I can't see a thing.

16:51.005 --> 16:52.097
Who is it?

16:52.574 --> 16:55.565
Sorry to bother, but I need help.

16:56.510 --> 16:58.671
Can I make a quick phone call?

16:58.879 --> 17:01.677
- Don't you have a cell phone?
- My battery ran out.

17:03.083 --> 17:06.849
- What happened?
- My car broke down in the street corner.

17:08.555 --> 17:10.523
No, I'm sorry, but...

17:10.891 --> 17:13.485
My husband works tomorrow.
He's sleeping already.

17:15.662 --> 17:18.494
I won't make any noise.
It'll just take a minute, I promise.

17:19.031 --> 17:20.623
Please.

17:21.067 --> 17:23.001
No, I'm sorry.

17:23.603 --> 17:27.539
Listen, try... try some other house.
There's plenty of people still awake.

17:28.307 --> 17:30.400
Please, I'll just take a second.

17:30.610 --> 17:32.976
I don't wanna be alone,
with all that violence.

17:33.446 --> 17:35.676
My husband is sleeping, I told you!

17:36.082 --> 17:38.482
Your husband is not sleeping, Sarah.

17:39.218 --> 17:40.947
He is dead.

17:41.754 --> 17:43.448
What?

17:45.557 --> 17:47.684
Open the door, Sarah.

17:49.728 --> 17:51.628
Who are you?

17:52.764 --> 17:54.698
How do you know my name?

17:56.768 --> 17:58.633
Open the door and you'll find out.

18:07.011 --> 18:09.241
I'm gonna call the police, you hear me?

19:16.945 --> 19:19.038
Alright. Go fuck yourself!

19:20.715 --> 19:22.546
Hello?

19:25.486 --> 19:29.286
There's a strange woman by my door.
Please, hurry up.

19:30.258 --> 19:33.284
I don't know what she wants.
She knows my name...

19:33.894 --> 19:35.759
She knows everything about me...

19:36.931 --> 19:38.865
I'm pregnant!

19:52.445 --> 19:55.710
The police will be here in
five minutes! Just get out!

22:35.735 --> 22:39.000
Good evening. Did you call us
about somebody trying to break in?

22:39.205 --> 22:41.230
Yes, it was me. Come in.

22:43.176 --> 22:44.768
Do you live alone?

22:44.977 --> 22:46.205
Yes.

22:46.612 --> 22:50.173
- Another guy afraid to be a father?
- It's not that simple.

22:50.416 --> 22:54.318
- Who's this woman?
- I don't know. But she knows my name.

22:55.221 --> 22:57.712
Which is in the mailbox right outside.

22:59.391 --> 23:01.518
She knows things about me.

23:26.116 --> 23:28.050
Are you sure it's a woman?

23:28.853 --> 23:30.343
Have you seen the face, or...

23:30.554 --> 23:32.920
No. She stayed in the dark.

23:33.157 --> 23:36.388
I tried to take a picture of her,
but this is all I got.

23:37.461 --> 23:40.225
Alright. There's not much
we can do with this.

23:52.742 --> 23:56.041
There's no one around.
Don't worry, she's gone.

23:57.113 --> 23:59.513
I'll lock you up for tonight.

24:01.751 --> 24:04.117
We'll notify the night patrol.

24:04.320 --> 24:08.120
We have all our men in service, but...
we'll send a notification.

24:08.791 --> 24:12.055
They'll show up during the night
to see if you're ok.

24:12.294 --> 24:13.727
Thank you.

24:19.635 --> 24:23.127
- It's very quiet for a Christmas Eve around here.
- It is always like this.

24:23.739 --> 24:26.640
- Good night, m'am.
- Don't worry, she won't return.

24:27.109 --> 24:28.770
Have a good night.

24:41.622 --> 24:47.219
...November 27, and the accidental death
of two French, sons of immigrants.

24:47.495 --> 24:51.591
The riot has spread through the poor
areas of Paris suburbs...

24:51.799 --> 24:53.767
and the big cities.

24:54.001 --> 24:57.767
A great number of innocent people,
police officers and firemen were injured.

24:58.039 --> 25:00.768
More than 300 communities
were affected...

25:01.107 --> 25:03.837
4.900 vehicles have been burned...

25:13.653 --> 25:16.281
More than 2.000 imigrants
involved in the riot...

25:16.489 --> 25:19.049
What do you want?
You're pissing me off.

25:20.460 --> 25:25.123
Comments from the secretary of interior,
disclosed by the press...

25:58.196 --> 26:00.858
Hello, it's me again,
Jean-Pierre.

26:01.099 --> 26:03.829
You must be eating, I guess.

26:04.335 --> 26:06.360
Something weird happened tonight...

26:06.571 --> 26:09.870
and I hope tomorrow you can
blow up some pictures for me.

26:10.074 --> 26:11.701
All right. See you in the morning.

33:41.006 --> 33:42.598
Sarah?

33:46.478 --> 33:49.413
Forgive me. I'm sorry to bother you.

33:49.948 --> 33:52.849
Jean-Pierre Montalban,
Sarah's chief-editor.

34:26.850 --> 34:30.286
Sarah is going to my
Christmas dinner.

34:30.720 --> 34:34.884
I just stoped by to see if she's... I'm
worried about all this violence.

34:35.091 --> 34:39.323
She asked me to pick her up...
she gave me the keys... tomorrow morning.

34:39.596 --> 34:42.860
Anyway, I see her mother has
arrived before me.

34:43.165 --> 34:45.633
When a daughter needs help,
a mother knows.

34:47.703 --> 34:49.034
Sure.

34:49.271 --> 34:51.671
Well, is everything okay?

34:51.874 --> 34:53.808
She went to bed an hour ago.

34:56.411 --> 34:58.106
I better get going.

34:58.514 --> 34:59.981
See you later.

35:01.783 --> 35:03.808
Please, don't go just yet.
Would you have a drink?

35:04.019 --> 35:07.010
I was looking forward to meeting you.
Say you'll accept the drink.

35:25.973 --> 35:29.500
Sra. Scarangella,
are you excited to become a grandmother?

35:31.511 --> 35:34.537
It took hours for her to sleep.
Don't wake her up.

35:35.582 --> 35:37.914
Of course, you're right. I'm sorry.

35:38.885 --> 35:40.944
It's good she's been holding it together.

35:41.154 --> 35:44.487
She's been through a lot because
of the accident. Me too, of course.

35:45.425 --> 35:47.859
These last months
have been terrible.

35:48.061 --> 35:50.791
But I know this birth will
save us. One more drink?

36:26.598 --> 36:28.293
What the hell

36:31.669 --> 36:36.038
My little photographer, always
dropping her pictures around.

36:36.474 --> 36:41.935
When did she take this? Any idea?
She called me about it.

36:44.581 --> 36:46.640
Really? What did she say?

36:46.850 --> 36:50.980
Something was bothering her. It was
a picture she wanted blown up.

36:51.188 --> 36:52.746
Blown up?

36:53.090 --> 36:55.752
I'm not sure what,
she wanted...

36:56.260 --> 36:59.229
to blow it up or
just make it clearer.

37:01.265 --> 37:03.597
That face, for example.

37:10.373 --> 37:13.171
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

37:14.744 --> 37:16.143
Where's Sarah?

37:16.345 --> 37:18.609
Maybe you should tell us who you are.

37:19.482 --> 37:22.417
You just enter people's houses like that?
Lower your voice, Sarah is sleeping.

37:22.618 --> 37:24.449
Where's my daughter?

37:31.093 --> 37:33.026
So, who are you?

37:34.296 --> 37:36.196
That's you in the picture.

37:41.936 --> 37:43.267
Sarah?

37:46.074 --> 37:47.974
Are you all right?

38:02.623 --> 38:04.181
Mom.

38:06.827 --> 38:08.522
Mom?

38:10.831 --> 38:12.423
Mom!

38:16.904 --> 38:18.394
Sarah?

38:21.941 --> 38:23.431
Mom!

38:29.482 --> 38:31.347
Help!

38:33.419 --> 38:35.250
Help me! Help me!

40:38.940 --> 40:40.100
Damn!

42:47.729 --> 42:49.287
Who are you?

43:03.979 --> 43:05.537
Open the door!

44:31.462 --> 44:32.759
Open!

44:39.203 --> 44:40.602
Open the door!

44:50.280 --> 44:51.770
Why me?

44:59.856 --> 45:01.517
I want one.

45:03.727 --> 45:06.457
What kind of man would fuck
a crazy maniac like you?

45:11.000 --> 45:12.830
Open up, Sarah!

45:14.269 --> 45:16.134
Don't be afraid.

45:17.339 --> 45:20.638
You don't need this baby anymore.
I'll take care of him.

45:26.615 --> 45:28.310
What are you talking about?

45:56.110 --> 45:59.375
Let's stop by to check on
the lady, ok?

45:59.614 --> 46:04.243
Then we'll take our lucky guy
to the precint. Mr. AbdeI Shani Essadi.

46:04.951 --> 46:08.216
You got the wrong guy, I swear.
I don't play with molotov cocktails.

46:09.156 --> 46:12.614
And if I'm gonna torch some cars, I'm not
bringing my ID in my wallet.

46:52.797 --> 46:54.264
Shit!

47:00.205 --> 47:02.833
- I didn't do anything.
- Don't try to mess with me.

47:03.675 --> 47:06.667
First, we'll see if
Ms. Scarangella is sleeping...

47:06.878 --> 47:09.403
after that we'll lock this
young fella up...

47:09.614 --> 47:11.605
And go back after his friends.

47:11.816 --> 47:14.909
We can't let you spend Christmas Eve
by yourself in jail.

47:15.118 --> 47:18.451
Your friends are loose.
We'll bring them to you, so you can party.

47:18.655 --> 47:20.714
I don't give a fuck about Christmas!

47:22.025 --> 47:24.653
- Okay, you don't celebrate Christmas...
- Excuse me.

47:24.862 --> 47:27.092
Hello? How are you, sweetheart?

47:37.307 --> 47:39.638
- His girl is a pain in the ass.
- Tell me about it.

47:39.842 --> 47:41.969
But he's in the car
with the heat on.

47:42.812 --> 47:44.871
No. We're getting off duty.

47:45.081 --> 47:47.515
We'll check on some woman
and be back right after.

47:48.384 --> 47:49.942
Yes, I love you. Stop it.

47:50.152 --> 47:51.619
- She's giving you a hard time, huh?
- Just a second.

47:51.821 --> 47:53.413
Shut up, okay?

47:55.258 --> 47:58.159
Not you, I'm talking to a punk
in the car.

48:37.131 --> 48:40.999
- Walking through the snow.
- Sra. Scaringella, it's the police.

48:49.777 --> 48:51.744
- Hello, how are you doing?
- Merry Christmas.

48:51.945 --> 48:54.004
We're passing to see if everything's alright.

48:54.213 --> 48:57.011
We've been warned about a
woman disturbing you tonight.

48:58.251 --> 49:00.412
No. It's been hours, I'm fine.

49:00.954 --> 49:04.048
- Don't hesitate to call if she comes back.
- Sure.

49:07.327 --> 49:09.591
Sorry, what's that noise?

49:10.396 --> 49:13.388
It's my old washing machine's coil.

49:13.599 --> 49:15.657
It's cheaper to use it at night, huh?

49:16.768 --> 49:18.531
- Be well.
- Merry Christmas.

49:18.737 --> 49:20.637
- See you later.
- Goodbye, officer.

49:25.310 --> 49:27.505
Man, a coffee now...

49:32.184 --> 49:33.708
No, I'm listening to you.

50:34.410 --> 50:37.345
- Did you forget anything?
- Just a stupid detail.

50:41.417 --> 50:44.079
- Just curious about which name he'll have.
- Who?

50:44.286 --> 50:45.651
Your child.

50:47.556 --> 50:48.887
Keep an eye on her!

51:00.668 --> 51:02.397
Fuck! Arrest her! Arrest her!

51:02.603 --> 51:04.867
Hands behind your back! On the floor, now!

51:07.775 --> 51:09.675
It's a fucking war zone!

51:13.281 --> 51:14.771
It's the police!

51:16.283 --> 51:17.910
Don't move!

51:23.990 --> 51:26.424
Okay, I'm going to remove the scissors.
Don't move.

51:32.599 --> 51:34.726
Open the door! Open the door!

51:40.506 --> 51:41.973
No!

51:45.611 --> 51:48.444
Good, you can make it.
Open the door.

52:00.092 --> 52:01.889
Open the door!

52:06.631 --> 52:08.223
Oh my God!

52:20.145 --> 52:21.407
Sorry, gotta go.

52:22.347 --> 52:25.009
- You'll have to come along.
- What?

52:25.383 --> 52:26.680
Something went wrong.

52:35.559 --> 52:38.528
This is police brutality, man.
You're gonna tie me up like a dog?

52:38.729 --> 52:40.253
Shut the fuck up and move your ass.

52:42.032 --> 52:44.000
- Hey, wait a second!
- Move.

52:59.148 --> 53:01.412
- I wanna get out of here, please!
- Take this!

53:03.619 --> 53:05.143
Let me go!

53:23.805 --> 53:26.569
- We've got get out of this place!
- Come here!

53:27.309 --> 53:30.437
Are you okay?
Stay calm, all right?

53:32.781 --> 53:36.046
It's gonna be okay.
You... put yourself together!

53:37.786 --> 53:40.983
That's alright, I'll be right back. Wait here.

53:41.522 --> 53:44.514
- You! Do you know how to use this?
- No!

53:45.159 --> 53:49.289
Just push the trigger and shoot. Hey!
Just point and squeeze the trigger!

53:49.830 --> 53:52.094
- Please, let me get out of here!
- You're coming with me.

53:52.333 --> 53:53.857
I'll be right back, stay here.

54:34.706 --> 54:36.674
- What happened?
- Is she gone?

54:36.875 --> 54:39.275
She's gone. She escaped through the window.

54:39.911 --> 54:42.744
- She's still here!
- Calm down!

54:45.951 --> 54:48.681
Do you have a fuse box?
You know where it is?

54:49.187 --> 54:51.382
Look at me! Do you know where it is?

54:51.590 --> 54:53.455
Downstairs? Let's go.

54:54.759 --> 54:56.989
Wait, I'm going to give you a gun.

55:01.565 --> 55:03.430
Take this, take it.

55:05.369 --> 55:06.893
Watch out!

55:07.171 --> 55:08.832
Shit!

55:09.173 --> 55:11.198
Do you have any bandages?

55:12.443 --> 55:15.310
Here? In the drawer? Hold this!

55:16.147 --> 55:18.377
Hold the flashlight. Take it!

55:20.917 --> 55:22.817
I can't see. Take it.

55:28.091 --> 55:30.082
Hold up the light, dammit!

55:33.096 --> 55:34.996
That's alright, relax.

55:35.799 --> 55:38.233
- Take off the handcuffs!
- Shut up!

55:38.735 --> 55:41.568
Hold this. Hold the light still!

55:42.938 --> 55:45.930
I need to fix it.
Wait for me here.

55:47.609 --> 55:49.440
Stay still.

55:50.713 --> 55:54.444
- I killed my mother!
- It's alright, just calm down.

55:54.650 --> 55:56.982
- We've got get out of here!
- Damn!

56:01.323 --> 56:04.315
I'm going to call for backup and
an ambulance, ok?

56:04.526 --> 56:06.016
You'll be fine.

56:08.162 --> 56:09.720
Alright.

56:11.366 --> 56:14.460
Ok. Put this on. Can you walk?

56:15.036 --> 56:18.870
Wait in the bedroom. Give me your hand.
Give the hand! Help her.

56:21.943 --> 56:23.740
Can you walk?

56:28.483 --> 56:30.644
Are you alright? I'll be right back.

57:04.984 --> 57:06.542
C'mon, let's go.

57:10.723 --> 57:12.384
Hold the flashlight.

57:47.090 --> 57:49.718
Ok, I'll let you go when the
power is back.

57:50.160 --> 57:52.720
When you get out, find
any police officer.

57:54.631 --> 57:56.929
Hold the flashlight,
there's nobody here!

57:59.269 --> 58:01.169
Don't point it at my eyes!

58:06.009 --> 58:07.408
Fuck!

58:07.644 --> 58:09.270
- What?
- The light beam!

58:11.347 --> 58:13.144
What the fuck is this?

58:19.422 --> 58:21.515
Go back! Go back!

58:44.045 --> 58:46.479
Miss! She is still here!

58:48.450 --> 58:51.385
Come on, get up! Get up! Dammit!

58:56.157 --> 58:58.090
Where are the goddamn keys?

1:02:20.019 --> 1:02:21.384
Sarah.

1:07:00.655 --> 1:07:02.519
Where are you, bitch?

1:07:41.160 --> 1:07:43.651
Could you kill me again, Sarah?

1:07:53.104 --> 1:07:55.072
You've killed me once.

1:07:59.878 --> 1:08:02.244
My son, my baby.

1:08:04.149 --> 1:08:06.174
Finally inside me.

1:08:06.751 --> 1:08:08.742
Nobody is taking him away from me.

1:08:09.087 --> 1:08:11.180
Nobody can hurt him now.

1:08:11.489 --> 1:08:13.013
Nobody.

1:08:29.573 --> 1:08:31.939
They say there were
no survivors.

1:09:05.073 --> 1:09:06.472
Officer?

1:09:15.250 --> 1:09:16.615
Officer?

1:10:37.062 --> 1:10:39.087
The baby is coming out!

1:10:40.965 --> 1:10:42.432
The baby...

1:10:49.507 --> 1:10:50.997
Mommy!

1:10:54.745 --> 1:10:56.303
Calm down.

1:10:57.782 --> 1:10:59.579
I am here.

1:11:09.726 --> 1:11:11.591
I think it's stuck!

1:12:36.977 --> 1:12:38.535
Mommy!
