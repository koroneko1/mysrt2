00:00:16,922 --> 00:00:20,126
(slow, ominous music)

4
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:48,085
Welcome back to the program.

5
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:50,088
If you're just tuning
in, I'm sitting here live

6
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:52,890
with the sole survivor of
the Miles County Massacre,

7
00:00:52,892 --> 00:00:54,995
which occurred exactly one year
ago today.

8
00:00:55,928 --> 00:00:57,328
I've worked on this show for
many years

9
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,963
and I've never sat across from
someone

10
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:01,001
who has a story to tell quite
like yours.

11
00:01:02,035 --> 00:01:03,234
Thank you again for taking the
time

12
00:01:03,236 --> 00:01:04,902
to sit down and speak with me.

13
00:01:04,904 --> 00:01:06,272
[Survivor] It's my pleasure.

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,074
Now when we left off we were
talking

15
00:01:09,076 --> 00:01:11,809
about the moment you
woke up from the coma.

16
00:01:11,811 --> 00:01:13,178
Do you remember your initial
reaction

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,946
when you first saw your face?

18
00:01:14,948 --> 00:01:16,413
[Survivor] Yes.

19
00:01:16,415 --> 00:01:18,717
Would you like to share that
with us?

20
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:20,017
(dramatic music)

21
00:01:20,019 --> 00:01:21,121
I wished I was dead.

22
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:24,823
Do you still feel that way?

23
00:01:24,825 --> 00:01:27,225
People are frightened
by the way that I look,

24
00:01:27,227 --> 00:01:28,329
especially children.

25
00:01:29,463 --> 00:01:32,863
And it's really difficult
for me to deal with that,

26
00:01:32,865 --> 00:01:34,300
so isolation is ideal.

27
00:01:36,936 --> 00:01:38,438
Now what about your attacker,

28
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:42,806
a man identified only as Art the
Clown?

29
00:01:42,808 --> 00:01:46,276
There's a lot of controversy
surrounding his supposed death.

30
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:47,511
The authorities issued
a statement claiming

31
00:01:47,513 --> 00:01:50,014
that his body disappeared from
the county coroner's office

32
00:01:50,016 --> 00:01:51,381
the morning after the attack.

33
00:01:51,383 --> 00:01:52,816
He's dead.

34
00:01:52,818 --> 00:01:54,384
I saw it happen.

35
00:01:54,386 --> 00:01:57,354
(glass shattering)

36
00:01:57,356 --> 00:02:00,694
(dramatic rock music)

37
00:03:21,407 --> 00:03:23,141
Did you watch it?

38
00:03:23,143 --> 00:03:25,409
Oh my God, I thought she
was going to attack me.

39
00:03:25,411 --> 00:03:27,278
(dramatic music)

40
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,280
(people talking)

41
00:03:30,282 --> 00:03:32,219
My heart was pounding the entire
time.

42
00:03:33,587 --> 00:03:35,954
Yeah well, if you think she
looks that bad on television,

43
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:39,157
imagine what she looks like
sitting two feet away from you.

44
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:41,926
I thought I was going to gag at
one point.

45
00:03:41,928 --> 00:03:43,327
Babe, do me a favor.

46
00:03:43,329 --> 00:03:44,862
If I ever look like that,
promise me

47
00:03:44,864 --> 00:03:46,266
you'll put me out of my misery.

48
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:48,533
You think I'm kidding?

49
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:49,837
I'll do it myself.

50
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,271
Yeah, Tom said we won't
know until the morning.

51
00:03:53,273 --> 00:03:55,339
But he thinks the ratings
are going to go up big time.

52
00:03:55,341 --> 00:03:57,544
(rustling)

53
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:03,647
(laughs)
Exactly.

54
00:04:03,649 --> 00:04:06,316
We've finally figured out
the formula for success,

55
00:04:06,318 --> 00:04:09,119
faceless victims and a host in
jeopardy.

56
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:09,954
(slow, ominous music)

57
00:04:09,956 --> 00:04:10,821
Yeah, watch next month, it's
going

58
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:12,959
to be called Monica's House of
Horrors.

59
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:15,659
Shit.

60
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:16,493
Hey, can I call you back?

61
00:04:16,495 --> 00:04:19,197
I have like 50 people calling
me.

62
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,198
Okay.

63
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,599
Alright, love you too.

64
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:22,469
Bye.

65
00:04:24,337 --> 00:04:25,206
Hello?

66
00:04:26,505 --> 00:04:28,005
Tom?

67
00:04:28,007 --> 00:04:30,642
(rustling)

68
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:33,981
(slow, ominous music)

69
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:54,532
(yelling)
(screaming)

70
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:57,036
(squelching)

71
00:05:06,178 --> 00:05:07,577
(slow, ominous music)

72
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:10,918
(staggered breathing)

73
00:05:12,118 --> 00:05:14,452
(coughing)

74
00:05:14,454 --> 00:05:16,656
(laughing)

75
00:05:21,728 --> 00:05:25,199
(tense, dramatic music)

76
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,565
(laughing)

77
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:30,368
[Dawn] I think I just twisted
my ankle.

78
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,204
Dawn, really?

79
00:05:32,104 --> 00:05:33,503
Thanks a lot, by the way.

80
00:05:33,505 --> 00:05:34,638
For what?

81
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,241
Promising you weren't
gonna get shit faced tonight.

82
00:05:37,243 --> 00:05:38,642
Guys kept buying me drinks.

83
00:05:38,644 --> 00:05:41,512
I can't help it if people
find me interesting.

84
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:42,479
Yeah.

85
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:45,082
Definitely your mind that they
were after.

86
00:05:45,084 --> 00:05:46,183
Who are you texting?

87
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:47,185
None of your business.

88
00:05:47,187 --> 00:05:49,219
You gave that asshole
your number, didn't you?

89
00:05:49,221 --> 00:05:51,688
Oh my god, you're so jealous.

90
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,690
Of what?

91
00:05:52,692 --> 00:05:54,092
That kid was talking to
like five other girls.

92
00:05:54,094 --> 00:05:55,426
Oh, stop being such a bitch.

93
00:05:55,428 --> 00:05:56,426
Just get in the car.

94
00:05:56,428 --> 00:05:58,462
Oh, you are not driving.

95
00:05:58,464 --> 00:05:59,731
I'm fine.

96
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,065
Give me the keys.

97
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:02,500
Give me the keys.

98
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:04,368
Dawn, I don't feel like dying
tonight.

99
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,270
Really?

100
00:06:05,272 --> 00:06:07,137
Are we really gonna do this
right now?

101
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:09,140
Give me the keys.

102
00:06:09,142 --> 00:06:11,476
I'm gonna paw at you like a cat.

103
00:06:11,478 --> 00:06:12,342
Give me what I want.

104
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:14,311
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

105
00:06:14,313 --> 00:06:16,046
You drive.

106
00:06:16,048 --> 00:06:19,416
- (chuckling)
- Thank you.

107
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:23,556
(wind blowing)
(slow, ominous music)

108
00:06:25,425 --> 00:06:26,690
I'm fucking lit.

109
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:27,825
(laughing)

110
00:06:27,827 --> 00:06:30,628
But if I get something to
eat, I can drive us, okay?

111
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,796
There's a place that's
open late, we can sober up.

112
00:06:32,798 --> 00:06:34,332
[Dawn] Did you say food?

113
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:35,633
I said food.

114
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:37,168
You know the place, it's
right there, come on.

115
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:38,169
Okay, okay, okay.

116
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,772
Just like give me one minute.

117
00:06:40,774 --> 00:06:42,140
Fuck me.

118
00:06:42,142 --> 00:06:44,111
Like one minute, for real.

119
00:06:45,678 --> 00:06:49,447
(slow, ominous music)

120
00:06:49,449 --> 00:06:50,317
D.

121
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:54,251
D.

122
00:06:54,253 --> 00:06:55,152
What?

123
00:06:55,154 --> 00:06:56,289
[Tara] Look.

124
00:06:57,824 --> 00:06:59,123
[Dawn] Holy shit.

125
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,157
Yeah, that's not funny.

126
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:01,625
I'm about to scream.

127
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:03,161
Hey, handsome.

128
00:07:03,163 --> 00:07:03,861
Dawn, cut it out.

129
00:07:03,863 --> 00:07:05,296
My friend wants your number.

130
00:07:05,298 --> 00:07:07,265
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

131
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:08,132
[Dawn] Come buy us dinner.

132
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:08,799
Stop.

133
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:10,267
Just shut the fuck up.

134
00:07:10,269 --> 00:07:10,902
Or what?

135
00:07:10,904 --> 00:07:12,803
Maybe he'll drive us home.

136
00:07:12,805 --> 00:07:14,575
I'm sorry, she's drunk.

137
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:19,512
(slow, ominous music)

138
00:07:23,283 --> 00:07:24,515
Let's go.

139
00:07:24,517 --> 00:07:25,416
Come on.

140
00:07:25,418 --> 00:07:27,085
Let's just go.

141
00:07:27,087 --> 00:07:29,623
(keys jangling)

142
00:07:30,623 --> 00:07:33,291
(upbeat pop rock music)

143
00:07:33,293 --> 00:07:34,157
Oh yeah?

144
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,128
You get dressed up?

145
00:07:36,096 --> 00:07:37,794
Oh, you're a sick fuck.

146
00:07:37,796 --> 00:07:38,695
Where am I gonna go?

147
00:07:38,697 --> 00:07:40,130
Back to my wife?

148
00:07:40,132 --> 00:07:40,800
Same shit.

149
00:07:41,868 --> 00:07:43,734
Maybe another two hours?

150
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:44,835
Alright.

151
00:07:44,837 --> 00:07:46,105
Alright, bye.

152
00:07:53,413 --> 00:07:54,712
Great.

153
00:07:54,714 --> 00:07:56,681
(phone ringing)

154
00:07:56,683 --> 00:07:58,382
Ugh.

155
00:07:58,384 --> 00:08:02,520
That was the longest
piss I have ever taken.

156
00:08:02,522 --> 00:08:04,358
Thank you for sharing that.

157
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:08,392
This guy wants me to meet
him at his apartment right now.

158
00:08:08,394 --> 00:08:09,260
What a shocker.

159
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:10,527
I told him I would.

160
00:08:10,529 --> 00:08:11,561
What?

161
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:12,398
I'm kidding.

162
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,832
I have a little more
self respect than that.

163
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:17,537
If you only had a brain.

164
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:22,205
I've been wanting to
use that one all night.

165
00:08:22,207 --> 00:08:23,808
Congratulations.

166
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,544
(chuckling)

167
00:08:26,546 --> 00:08:28,849
(rock music)

168
00:08:39,825 --> 00:08:41,260
Look it's your boyfriend.

169
00:08:42,461 --> 00:08:44,629
I told you this a week ago,
we'll go to your mother's.

170
00:08:44,631 --> 00:08:46,366
I don't know, six weeks from
now.

171
00:08:47,934 --> 00:08:49,502
I'll be right with you buddy.

172
00:08:50,435 --> 00:08:51,601
You gotta see the shape of this
fuckin'

173
00:08:51,603 --> 00:08:52,772
guy that just walked in.

174
00:08:54,373 --> 00:08:57,510
(slow, ominous music)

175
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:22,236
[Dawn] Are you okay?

176
00:09:23,969 --> 00:09:27,306
(slow, ominous music)

177
00:09:28,273 --> 00:09:30,607
I think we should get our food
to go.

178
00:09:30,609 --> 00:09:31,445
Why?

179
00:09:32,445 --> 00:09:35,279
(slow, ominous music)

180
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:36,150
Him?

181
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:38,417
Seriously, I wanna leave.

182
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:40,820
Jesus Christ.

183
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:43,221
D, stop.

184
00:09:43,223 --> 00:09:44,157
Uh, excuse me?

185
00:09:45,224 --> 00:09:45,923
Excuse me?

186
00:09:45,925 --> 00:09:47,692
Can I get a picture with you?

187
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:48,558
Dawn, come on.

188
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,396
Shut up.

189
00:09:51,598 --> 00:09:52,466
Hello?

190
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:54,966
(snapping)

191
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:55,836
Hello?

192
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:58,369
Okay.

193
00:09:58,371 --> 00:10:00,841
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

194
00:10:02,242 --> 00:10:04,909
(slow, ominous music)

195
00:10:04,911 --> 00:10:06,409
(popping)
Oh.

196
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:07,812
Oh.

197
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:08,714
Sorry.

198
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:14,584
(phone ringing)

199
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:17,723
(slow, ominous music)

200
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:27,733
Thanks.

201
00:10:30,902 --> 00:10:32,569
What the hell is wrong with
you?

202
00:10:32,571 --> 00:10:33,438
What?

203
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,138
Did you think he was gonna hack
me up

204
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,242
into little pieces or something?

205
00:10:37,574 --> 00:10:37,945
What can I get for you buddy?

206
00:10:40,046 --> 00:10:40,914
Hey?

207
00:10:41,848 --> 00:10:42,782
Hello?

208
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,850
(slow, ominous music)

209
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:48,722
If you don't order anything,
you're gonna have to leave.

210
00:10:49,988 --> 00:10:52,358
You already have eight likes.

211
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,229
Can you hear me in there?

212
00:10:57,897 --> 00:11:00,834
Oh god, it's gonna be a long
night.

213
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:05,838
(slow, ominous music)

214
00:11:19,951 --> 00:11:22,355
(cranking)

215
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:31,764
(slow, ominous music)

216
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:34,935
Aww.

217
00:11:37,969 --> 00:11:41,805
(slow, ominous music)
(Dawn giggling)

218
00:11:41,807 --> 00:11:42,775
What are you doing?

219
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,549
Thanks.

220
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:57,420
(Dawn chuckling)

221
00:11:57,422 --> 00:11:59,923
Okay, not for nothing,
but that's the nicest thing

222
00:11:59,925 --> 00:12:02,058
a guy's done for you all night.

223
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,593
Seriously?

224
00:12:03,595 --> 00:12:04,562
What the fuck?

225
00:12:04,564 --> 00:12:05,666
Here you go ladies.

226
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,466
Yes.

227
00:12:08,468 --> 00:12:09,667
You two okay?

228
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:10,771
Oh, he's harmless.

229
00:12:11,704 --> 00:12:12,572
You okay?

230
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:15,573
Don't worry, I'll take care of
him.

231
00:12:15,575 --> 00:12:16,509
Enjoy your pizza.

232
00:12:18,844 --> 00:12:21,947
(slow, ominous music)

233
00:12:31,858 --> 00:12:34,891
What do you keep staring at?

234
00:12:34,893 --> 00:12:36,059
That bag.

235
00:12:36,061 --> 00:12:37,563
What do you think is in it?

236
00:12:39,931 --> 00:12:41,131
I don't know, who cares?

237
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:42,101
Just eat your food.

238
00:12:45,637 --> 00:12:47,704
You fuckin' freak!

239
00:12:47,706 --> 00:12:48,405
Get over here.

240
00:12:48,407 --> 00:12:50,875
All night with you, you fuck.

241
00:12:50,877 --> 00:12:51,777
Enough.

242
00:12:52,844 --> 00:12:55,446
(tense, dramatic music)

243
00:12:55,448 --> 00:12:57,114
Get outta here.

244
00:12:57,116 --> 00:13:01,184
(tense, dramatic music)

245
00:13:01,186 --> 00:13:04,390
Take your shit, and don't come
back.

246
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:08,992
(tense, dramatic music)

247
00:13:08,994 --> 00:13:10,760
Ramon, grab a mob and some
bleach.

248
00:13:10,762 --> 00:13:11,629
Eh, you okay?

249
00:13:11,631 --> 00:13:12,866
[Man] Yeah, I'm alright.

250
00:13:14,599 --> 00:13:17,738
(slow, ominous music)

251
00:13:27,446 --> 00:13:29,513
[Dawn] What do you think
that guy did in there?

252
00:13:29,515 --> 00:13:30,847
[Tara] Who knows.

253
00:13:30,849 --> 00:13:32,716
[Dawn] Probably jizzed
all over the place,

254
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:33,683
fucking pervert.

255
00:13:33,685 --> 00:13:35,586
[Tara] Stop.

256
00:13:35,588 --> 00:13:36,721
What?

257
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:38,555
I'm telling you that guy
totally whacked off in there.

258
00:13:38,557 --> 00:13:40,624
He was obviously turned on by
you.

259
00:13:40,626 --> 00:13:41,925
You're fuckin' sick.

260
00:13:41,927 --> 00:13:42,828
You know that?

261
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,728
(dogs barking)

262
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,664
What?

263
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:50,167
- Look at your hand.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

264
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:51,802
Look, at least he had the
courtesy to do

265
00:13:51,804 --> 00:13:52,903
whatever he did in private.

266
00:13:52,905 --> 00:13:56,606
I mean, he could have
whipped it out right there.

267
00:13:56,608 --> 00:13:58,545
I really don't need the
visual.

268
00:14:01,147 --> 00:14:03,047
[Dawn] Well are you okay to
drive?

269
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,752
Yeah, trust me, that
sobered me right the fuck up.

270
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:08,251
- Oh my god.
- What?

271
00:14:08,253 --> 00:14:09,122
Your tire.

272
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:11,056
Fuck me.

273
00:14:12,157 --> 00:14:14,558
Has it been like this the whole
time?

274
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,893
I think I would have said
something if I'd noticed

275
00:14:15,895 --> 00:14:17,760
that your tire had exploded.

276
00:14:17,762 --> 00:14:20,130
Why does this shit always
happen to me?

277
00:14:20,132 --> 00:14:21,635
[Tara] Do you have a spare?

278
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:23,803
It's on the car.

279
00:14:24,903 --> 00:14:25,805
Wow.

280
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,939
I'm starting to feel sick.

281
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:32,108
Just, give me your phone.

282
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,112
I'll call my sister.

283
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:37,615
(slow, ominous music)

284
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,750
Yo Steve, this is sick.

285
00:14:39,752 --> 00:14:42,285
I better get overtime for this.

286
00:14:42,287 --> 00:14:44,188
No joke, this is disgusting.

287
00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,055
You got me cleanin' piss
and shit at one o'clock

288
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,757
in the morning.

289
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:49,226
Let the guy who handles
food take care of it,

290
00:14:49,228 --> 00:14:50,897
real fuckin' sanitary.

291
00:14:51,897 --> 00:14:54,166
Steve, time and a half, or I'm
out.

292
00:14:56,835 --> 00:14:57,671
You hear me?

293
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:02,209
(rock music)

294
00:15:04,243 --> 00:15:06,979
(phone ringing)

295
00:15:08,613 --> 00:15:09,313
Hello?

296
00:15:09,315 --> 00:15:10,550
[Tara] Hi, it's me.

297
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,816
Tara?

298
00:15:12,818 --> 00:15:13,983
Yeah, my phone died.

299
00:15:13,985 --> 00:15:15,885
I'm calling from Dawn's.

300
00:15:15,887 --> 00:15:16,754
Ah.

301
00:15:16,756 --> 00:15:17,789
Your phone died.

302
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,023
Can you ever go out
without using social media

303
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:20,924
every 30 seconds?

304
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:22,659
I think you're the only one in
America

305
00:15:22,661 --> 00:15:24,260
who has that sort of restraint.

306
00:15:24,262 --> 00:15:25,996
Yeah, that's probably right.

307
00:15:25,998 --> 00:15:27,231
[Tara] Did I wake you?

308
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:30,634
No, I am studying for
my midterm tomorrow.

309
00:15:30,636 --> 00:15:31,901
Oh, shit.

310
00:15:31,903 --> 00:15:36,008
Why, what is it?

311
00:15:36,709 --> 00:15:37,975
What is it, Tara?

312
00:15:37,977 --> 00:15:40,177
Dawn and I are sort
of stranded right now.

313
00:15:40,179 --> 00:15:41,978
She has a flat tire and no spare

314
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,617
and I was kind of hoping
you could pick us up?

315
00:15:45,984 --> 00:15:48,651
I have to be up in five hours,
Tara.

316
00:15:48,653 --> 00:15:49,687
Yeah, I know Vic.

317
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:51,121
Don't bother, seriously.

318
00:15:51,123 --> 00:15:52,825
I didn't realize you had a test.

319
00:15:54,093 --> 00:15:56,530
(laughing)

320
00:15:58,164 --> 00:15:59,032
Sorry.

321
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,836
I didn't know you were here.

322
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:06,071
(rock music)

323
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,808
You know what?

324
00:16:11,810 --> 00:16:13,776
I gotta stretch my legs
and besides, if I fail,

325
00:16:13,778 --> 00:16:15,245
I can always blame you.

326
00:16:15,247 --> 00:16:17,751
You are the best sister in the
world.

327
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,787
Yeah.

328
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:23,723
Where are you?

329
00:16:35,935 --> 00:16:36,969
What's wrong?

330
00:16:38,771 --> 00:16:39,837
I'm fine.

331
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,105
Why?

332
00:16:41,107 --> 00:16:44,243
You keep looking over your
shoulder.

333
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,211
Just thinking.

334
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:48,048
About?

335
00:16:49,415 --> 00:16:50,250
Nothing.

336
00:16:51,316 --> 00:16:52,185
Tell me.

337
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,222
What if that guy did this to
your car?

338
00:16:58,657 --> 00:16:59,289
What guy?

339
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,189
The clown?

340
00:17:00,191 --> 00:17:01,226
[Tara] I'm serious.

341
00:17:03,061 --> 00:17:05,998
Well, you really think
someone slashed my tires?

342
00:17:06,931 --> 00:17:09,667
Well, he knows this is your
car.

343
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:11,435
He saw us getting into it
earlier.

344
00:17:11,437 --> 00:17:13,036
That's fucking ridiculous.

345
00:17:13,038 --> 00:17:15,741
I probably just ran over
a nail or something.

346
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:19,043
I should have just let you
drive.

347
00:17:19,045 --> 00:17:22,079
Yeah, you should have.

348
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:25,114
But as usual, you have
to be the good Samaritan

349
00:17:25,116 --> 00:17:26,216
so here we are.

350
00:17:26,218 --> 00:17:27,284
Stuck.

351
00:17:27,286 --> 00:17:29,154
Like a couple of assholes.

352
00:17:30,355 --> 00:17:33,357
(chuckling)

353
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,696
(slow, ominous music)

354
00:17:42,701 --> 00:17:43,369
Steve!

355
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:47,907
(slow, ominous music)

356
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,420
(dramatic music)

357
00:18:04,422 --> 00:18:05,290
Oh fuck!

358
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:09,895
(tense, dramatic music)

359
00:18:14,834 --> 00:18:15,799
Help!

360
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:19,969
Somebody!
(phone ringing)

361
00:18:19,971 --> 00:18:21,170
(tense, dramatic music)

362
00:18:21,172 --> 00:18:23,442
(screaming)

363
00:18:24,343 --> 00:18:27,846
(tense, dramatic music)

364
00:18:32,218 --> 00:18:34,418
(stabbing)

365
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,119
(gasping)

366
00:18:35,121 --> 00:18:38,155
Yeah, but what if I'm right,

367
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:40,990
and he's out there watching us
right now?

368
00:18:40,992 --> 00:18:42,226
(gasping)

369
00:18:42,228 --> 00:18:44,393
Show him your tits.

370
00:18:44,395 --> 00:18:46,429
I don't know, Tara.

371
00:18:46,431 --> 00:18:48,465
Look, that guy was harmless.

372
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:51,935
He's just some douchebag in a
costume

373
00:18:51,937 --> 00:18:54,905
acting like a retard
because it's Halloween.

374
00:18:54,907 --> 00:18:59,176
(stabbing)
(yelling)

375
00:18:59,178 --> 00:19:00,177
No.

376
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:01,147
He was different.

377
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,348
(stabbing)
(yelling)

378
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,416
He smiled.

379
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:08,151
The way he kept staring at
us with those dead eyes.

380
00:19:08,153 --> 00:19:10,920
(stabbing)

381
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,357
What was in that bag?

382
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:16,092
(tense, dramatic music)

383
00:19:16,094 --> 00:19:17,794
I don't know, Tara.

384
00:19:17,796 --> 00:19:19,963
The point is, he's gone,

385
00:19:19,965 --> 00:19:21,465
and you're never gonna see him
again.

386
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:25,805
So cut the shit, 'cause you're
starting to freak me out.

387
00:19:41,319 --> 00:19:42,986
I really have to pee.

388
00:19:42,988 --> 00:19:43,957
So go.

389
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:46,290
Go?

390
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:46,990
Go where?

391
00:19:46,992 --> 00:19:48,159
It's the middle of the night.

392
00:19:48,161 --> 00:19:50,928
I can't just pop a squat
in the middle of the street

393
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:51,996
and pee like you do.

394
00:19:51,998 --> 00:19:54,264
Well tough shit, because
it's gonna be a while

395
00:19:54,266 --> 00:19:56,466
before your sister gets here.

396
00:19:56,468 --> 00:19:57,336
Fuck.

397
00:19:59,572 --> 00:20:02,508
(deeply exhaling)

398
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:12,114
Maybe that guy has a
bathroom that you can use.

399
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:13,316
Who?

400
00:20:13,318 --> 00:20:15,953
That creepy guy who just got
out of that

401
00:20:15,955 --> 00:20:17,991
even creepier looking building.

402
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:20,890
Tara.

403
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:22,094
I was kidding.

404
00:20:23,328 --> 00:20:24,196
Excuse me?

405
00:20:25,396 --> 00:20:26,263
Yes?

406
00:20:26,265 --> 00:20:27,198
I'm sorry to bother you.

407
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,432
Is there a bathroom in there I
could use?

408
00:20:29,434 --> 00:20:31,034
Sorry, I don't own the place.

409
00:20:31,036 --> 00:20:32,436
I'm not supposed to let anyone
in here.

410
00:20:32,438 --> 00:20:34,237
Please, mister, it's an
emergency.

411
00:20:34,239 --> 00:20:35,538
I'll be two seconds.

412
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,975
Honestly, I could get
in a lot of trouble.

413
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:39,142
Who's gonna know?

414
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:41,978
[Dawn] Just let her use
the bathroom, for god sakes.

415
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:43,849
She'll make it worth your while.

416
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:46,649
A friend of yours?

417
00:20:46,651 --> 00:20:49,154
Yeah, I'm sorry, she's drunk.

418
00:20:50,256 --> 00:20:53,023
It's been a long night.

419
00:20:53,025 --> 00:20:54,024
Alright.

420
00:20:54,026 --> 00:20:55,492
Just make it quick, okay?

421
00:20:55,494 --> 00:20:56,329
Thank you.

422
00:20:58,663 --> 00:21:01,334
Guy's even weirder
looking than the clown was.

423
00:21:06,971 --> 00:21:07,840
This way.

424
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:12,409
Good thing you called me when I
did.

425
00:21:12,411 --> 00:21:15,144
I was about to bomb the
hell out of this place.

426
00:21:15,146 --> 00:21:16,045
Bomb?

427
00:21:16,047 --> 00:21:17,147
Bug bomb.

428
00:21:17,149 --> 00:21:18,051
Pest control.

429
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:19,883
What kind of pest?

430
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:21,384
You sure you want me to tell
you before

431
00:21:21,386 --> 00:21:22,619
you use the bathroom?

432
00:21:22,621 --> 00:21:23,286
Why?

433
00:21:23,288 --> 00:21:24,621
Don't tell me it's roaches.

434
00:21:24,623 --> 00:21:25,656
It's not roaches.

435
00:21:25,658 --> 00:21:26,523
Oh good.

436
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:27,392
[Mike] It's rats.

437
00:21:28,661 --> 00:21:29,528
Rats?

438
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:33,063
(toilet flushing)

439
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:33,967
All clear.

440
00:21:35,034 --> 00:21:35,932
Are you sure?

441
00:21:35,934 --> 00:21:37,066
Rat free.

442
00:21:37,068 --> 00:21:39,636
What if one crawls out of the
toilet?

443
00:21:39,638 --> 00:21:42,272
I'd make it quick if I were
you.

444
00:21:42,274 --> 00:21:43,142
Good plan.

445
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,643
Do you need me to wait for you
or?

446
00:21:47,645 --> 00:21:49,246
I'll be alright.

447
00:21:49,248 --> 00:21:51,614
[Mike] You remember how we
came in?

448
00:21:51,616 --> 00:21:52,484
I remember.

449
00:21:54,053 --> 00:21:54,919
Okay.

450
00:21:54,921 --> 00:21:57,955
Well, um, you have a nice night
then.

451
00:21:57,957 --> 00:21:59,255
You too.

452
00:21:59,257 --> 00:22:00,093
Thanks again.

453
00:22:01,293 --> 00:22:02,262
Don't mention it.

454
00:22:04,162 --> 00:22:07,299

[Radio Announcer] This is
a WNEW breaking news alert.

470
00:23:05,324 --> 00:23:08,057
We have a major development

where authorities are
investigating a double homicide.

472
00:23:10,763 --> 00:23:13,130
Two employees at the Deer Hill's

murdered just moments ago.

but police are on the look out

476
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:21,571
for a tall, thin man
wearing a black and white

477
00:23:21,573 --> 00:23:25,207
clown costume and carrying
a large garbage bag.

Oh my god, you're
never gonna believe what

488
00:23:49,301 --> 00:23:51,304
I just heard on the radio.

Oh, I'm sorry.

500

Shh.

501
00:25:28,499 --> 00:25:30,236
You don't have to say a word.

502
00:25:31,402 --> 00:25:32,805
Your eyes tell me everything.

503
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,774
I didn't mean to frighten you,
dear.

00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:53,456
This is my daughter, Emily.

509
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,827
Say hello to the pretty young
lady.

510
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:05,735
It's been quite a while
since we've had neighbors.

511
00:26:05,737 --> 00:26:08,505
Perhaps we can do our laundry
together.

512
00:26:08,507 --> 00:26:10,442
I could use some good company.

513
00:26:11,943 --> 00:26:13,342
Yes.

514
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:14,747
That sounds like a good idea.

515
00:26:17,716 --> 00:26:19,549
Will you excuse me a moment?

516
00:26:19,551 --> 00:26:21,418
I have to find the landlord.

517
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,891
The first month's rent is due
and I don't wanna be late.

518
00:26:27,558 --> 00:26:30,896
Punctuality is the thief of
time, dear.

[Radio Announcer] Happy
Halloween boys and ghouls.

554
00:32:16,207 --> 00:32:18,941
The current temperature
is a crisp 43 degrees.

555
00:32:18,943 --> 00:32:20,709
The winds are starting to pick
up as well,

Now if you're still out and
about in

558

the Miles County Area, I'd
advise you to be extra careful

559
00:32:27,852 --> 00:32:28,551
out there.

560

Police are still on the look out

slaying

00:32:31,855 --> 00:32:34,957
of two employees at Deer
Hill's Pizzeria this morning.

563
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:36,825

all persons

569

in the Miles County Area to stay
indoors

570
00:32:48,672 --> 00:32:50,907
and notify authorities if they
see anyone

571
00:32:50,909 --> 00:32:53,176
matching the assailant's
description.

572
00:32:53,178 --> 00:32:54,046

You have to come with me now.

680
00:47:14,939 --> 00:47:16,904
There's a dead woman in your
basement.

681
00:47:16,906 --> 00:47:17,806
What?

682
00:47:17,808 --> 00:47:18,674
Yes.

683
00:47:18,676 --> 00:47:19,507
Dead.

684
00:47:19,509 --> 00:47:20,509
Dead, all dead.

685
00:47:20,511 --> 00:47:23,612
He's killing them one by
one by one, like cows.

686
00:47:23,614 --> 00:47:25,179
Look, lady.

687
00:47:25,181 --> 00:47:26,380
Lady.

688
00:47:26,382 --> 00:47:28,183
If you don't go away right
now, I'm gonna call the cops.

689
00:47:28,185 --> 00:47:29,717
Yes, that's what I've been
saying.

690
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:31,620
You need to call the
police right away because

691
00:47:31,622 --> 00:47:33,054
he's right downstairs
and he's probably going

692
00:47:33,056 --> 00:47:34,922
to kill you, too, if
you don't get somebody

693
00:47:34,924 --> 00:47:35,790
down here right away.

694
00:47:35,792 --> 00:47:36,824
What the fuck are you talking
about?

695
00:47:36,826 --> 00:47:38,226
The clown with the
white face and the little

696
00:47:38,228 --> 00:47:39,428
black hat.

697
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:41,562
He thinks what he's doing is
funny because he's laughing.

698
00:47:41,564 --> 00:47:44,199
But I know it's not funny
because they're all dead.

699
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:45,833
Get the hell away from me.

700
00:47:45,835 --> 00:47:46,902
I'm telling you.

701
00:47:46,904 --> 00:47:50,105
He knows I know, and he's
gonna try and kill me

702
00:47:50,107 --> 00:47:51,739
before he kills you.

703
00:47:51,741 --> 00:47:53,040
Don't touch me.

704
00:47:53,042 --> 00:47:53,708
Don't!

705
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,243
Help me, please, help me.

706
00:47:55,245 --> 00:47:56,914
I said, get the hell away from
me!

707
00:47:57,515 --> 00:48:00,518
(slow, tense music)

708
00:48:05,556 --> 00:48:06,955
Emily.

709
00:48:06,957 --> 00:48:07,826
Emily.

710
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:12,663
(slow, tense music)

711
00:48:14,265 --> 00:48:15,933
[Victoria] Hello?

712
00:48:17,301 --> 00:48:18,069
Is anybody in here?

713
00:48:19,536 --> 00:48:22,140
What The fuck is going on
here?

714
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:26,544
(slow, tense music)

715
00:48:33,551 --> 00:48:35,687
(hitting)

716
00:48:37,821 --> 00:48:41,290
(slow, tense music)

717
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:43,125
[Man] Wow.

718
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:45,794
Yeah, this better be good, man.

719
00:48:45,796 --> 00:48:46,661
What happened?

720
00:48:46,663 --> 00:48:47,564
You burn the place down?

721
00:48:48,966 --> 00:48:49,868
Hello?

722
00:48:51,569 --> 00:48:52,203
Mike?

723
00:48:54,138 --> 00:48:55,670
Wow, you flipped out?

724
00:48:55,672 --> 00:48:56,507
Hello?

725
00:48:57,274 --> 00:49:00,875
Yo!
(smashing)

726
00:49:00,877 --> 00:49:03,046
(smashing)

727
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:06,149
Tara?

728
00:49:08,785 --> 00:49:09,653
Dawn?

729
00:49:11,187 --> 00:49:12,055
Hello?

730
00:49:13,857 --> 00:49:16,960
(slow, ominous music)

731
00:49:24,602 --> 00:49:25,270
No.

732
00:49:27,937 --> 00:49:28,839
Emily?

733
00:49:33,076 --> 00:49:33,944
Emily?

734
00:49:37,147 --> 00:49:38,049
Okay.

735
00:49:39,015 --> 00:49:40,617
You're scaring mommy now.

736
00:49:43,152 --> 00:49:46,290
(slow, ominous music)

737
00:49:58,167 --> 00:50:00,301
(staggered breathing)

738
00:50:00,303 --> 00:50:01,171
Hello?

739
00:50:04,674 --> 00:50:05,676
Anyone here?

740
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,321
Come on, you guys.

741
00:50:19,656 --> 00:50:20,924
Emily, mommy's here.

742
00:50:21,859 --> 00:50:22,727
Where are you?

743
00:50:24,928 --> 00:50:25,797
Emily?

744
00:50:27,263 --> 00:50:28,098
Honey?

745
00:50:29,732 --> 00:50:32,870
(slow, ominous music)

746
00:50:41,812 --> 00:50:44,245

00:50:44,247 --> 00:50:46,383
(banging)

748
00:50:47,817 --> 00:50:48,685
Tara?

(staggered breathing)

750
00:50:55,325 --> 00:50:58,129
(dramatic music)

751
00:51:01,864 --> 00:51:02,899
Give her to me.

752
00:51:07,471 --> 00:51:08,339
Please.

753
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:12,207
Don't hurt my little girl.

754
00:51:12,209 --> 00:51:15,013
(dramatic music)

755
00:51:21,250 --> 00:51:22,719
You're frightening her.

756
00:51:23,886 --> 00:51:24,921
Can't you see that?

757
00:51:25,922 --> 00:51:26,790
Emily?

758
00:51:27,757 --> 00:51:28,924
It's okay.

759
00:51:28,926 --> 00:51:29,794
Mommy's here.

760
00:51:31,495 --> 00:51:34,832
(slow, ominous music)

761
00:51:48,245 --> 00:51:49,881
Is there kindness in you?

762
00:51:53,149 --> 00:51:55,385
Somewhere in your heart?

763
00:52:00,924 --> 00:52:04,762
Have you ever felt a mother's
touch?

764
00:52:11,935 --> 00:52:13,904
Can you show no mercy?

765
00:52:17,473 --> 00:52:20,777
She's all I have in this world.

766
00:52:23,547 --> 00:52:24,415
Spare her.

767
00:52:40,029 --> 00:52:43,167
(slow, ominous music)

00:53:08,524 --> 00:53:09,359
It's okay.

771
00:53:13,462 --> 00:53:14,332
Shh.

00:53:51,602 --> 00:53:52,868
[Mike] Hi, you've reached
Mike.

776
00:53:52,870 --> 00:53:54,002
Of course.

777
00:53:54,004 --> 00:53:55,870
[Mike] Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

778
00:53:55,872 --> 00:53:57,438
Mike, I'm outside.

779
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:00,141
Every fuckin' door in
this place is locked.

780
00:54:00,143 --> 00:54:01,379
Answer your phone!

781
00:54:02,913 --> 00:54:03,581
Asshole.

782
00:54:11,187 --> 00:54:12,055
Hello?

783
00:54:14,357 --> 00:54:15,892
Is anybody in there?

784
00:54:18,294 --> 00:54:21,565
This is the fucking last time I
do this.

785
00:54:23,634 --> 00:54:26,237
No consideration whatsoever.

786

(phone ringing)

787
00:54:32,408 --> 00:54:33,276

789
00:54:43,687 --> 00:54:44,555
Hello?

Guys.

791
00:54:57,301 --> 00:54:58,466
I know you're in there.

792
00:54:58,468 --> 00:55:00,404
Dawn, I can hear your phone.

793
00:55:12,015 --> 00:55:13,281
I swear to god, if this is a
prank,

794
00:55:13,283 --> 00:55:14,652
I'm gonna kill you both.

I'm gonna get help.

What the fuck?

810
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,625
Oh, it'll be okay.

811
00:57:03,627 --> 00:57:05,363
God, what's going on?

812

[Operator] What's wrong, sir?

930
01:10:18,187 --> 01:10:19,119
I wanna report a murder.

931
01:10:19,121 --> 01:10:20,286
There's two dead people.

932
01:10:20,288 --> 01:10:21,554
I've got this young woman over
here

that's just been assaulted.

She's bleeding everywhere.

935
01:10:23,459 --> 01:10:25,159
I think she's going into shock.

936
01:10:25,161 --> 01:10:26,927
[Operator] Okay, give me your
address.

937
01:10:26,929 --> 01:10:29,366
[Mike] Uh, Steuben Street,
it's the old warehouse.

938
01:10:30,398 --> 01:10:32,432
[Operator] What kind of
injuries does she have?

939
01:10:32,434 --> 01:10:33,534
She's cut all over.

940
01:10:33,536 --> 01:10:36,270
Some places really deep.

941
01:10:36,272 --> 01:10:37,937
I don't know, she's
bleeding all over the place.

942
01:10:37,939 --> 01:10:39,138
[Operator] Is she conscious?

943
01:10:39,140 --> 01:10:40,908
Yes, she conscious, but I have
no idea

944
01:10:40,910 --> 01:10:42,075
for how long.

945
01:10:42,077 --> 01:10:43,477
[Operator] Where is the
assailant now?

946
01:10:43,479 --> 01:10:44,881
I knocked him out.

947
01:10:45,581 --> 01:10:48,982
If this guy wakes up,
we are not safe here.

948
01:10:48,984 --> 01:10:52,288
This guy is armed and he's
a total fucking maniac.

949
01:10:53,355 --> 01:10:55,121
[Operator] Okay, sir,
what I want you to do now

950
01:10:55,123 --> 01:10:57,391
is just remain calm and
stay on the line with me

951
01:10:57,393 --> 01:10:58,595
until the police arrive.

952
01:10:59,629 --> 01:11:00,494
Look.

953
01:11:00,496 --> 01:11:01,462
We are not staying here.

954
01:11:01,464 --> 01:11:03,230
I'm taking this girl
to the emergency room.

955
01:11:03,232 --> 01:11:05,468
You just get your asses down
here now.

956
01:11:07,536 --> 01:11:08,368
I got my truck outside.

957

01:16:31,827 --> 01:16:35,398
(tense, dramatic music)

1025
01:16:38,399 --> 01:16:39,268
Do it!

1026
01:16:42,638 --> 01:16:43,869
No, no, no!

1027
01:16:43,871 --> 01:16:46,209
(gunshot)

1028
01:16:47,609 --> 01:16:50,880
(tense, dramatic music)

1029
01:16:53,482 --> 01:16:56,816
Central, we got shots fired.

1030
01:16:56,818 --> 01:16:58,220
Multiple causalities.

1031
01:16:59,455 --> 01:17:02,755
We needed buses and immediate
assistance.

1032
01:17:02,757 --> 01:17:05,961
(police radio chatter)

1033
01:17:07,563 --> 01:17:08,829
[Police Officer On The Left]
Oh my god.

1034
01:17:08,831 --> 01:17:09,732
What?

1035
01:17:10,733 --> 01:17:13,667
(Victoria gasping)

1036
01:17:13,669 --> 01:17:15,404
She's still alive.

1037
01:17:16,371 --> 01:17:20,509
(police radio chatter)
(sirens wailing)

1038
01:17:39,795 --> 01:17:40,793
Aw, come on, guys.

1039
01:17:40,795 --> 01:17:41,928
You're killin' me.

1040
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:44,500
The revolving doors won't
be installed until Monday.

1041
01:17:45,367 --> 01:17:46,703
Good to see you, too, doc.

1042
01:17:49,337 --> 01:17:50,704
[Coroner] Okay, what
are you bringing me?

1043
01:17:50,706 --> 01:17:52,739
Murder, suicide.

1044
01:17:52,741 --> 01:17:53,906
Wonderful.

1045
01:17:53,908 --> 01:17:55,741
What's behind showcase number
one?

1046
01:17:55,743 --> 01:17:57,343
Severe head trauma.

1047
01:17:57,345 --> 01:17:58,611
You're probably gonna have to
identify

1048
01:17:58,613 --> 01:18:00,746
this poor bastard by his teeth,

1049
01:18:00,748 --> 01:18:02,883
if you can dig them out
of the back of his skull.

1050
01:18:02,885 --> 01:18:05,384
So I should put on a seventh
pot of coffee, then, huh?

1051
01:18:05,386 --> 01:18:06,753
You're gonna need
something a lot stronger

1052
01:18:06,755 --> 01:18:07,753
than coffee.

1053
01:18:07,755 --> 01:18:10,490
Landon said they just
found two more bodies.

1054
01:18:10,492 --> 01:18:12,825
Jesus, they get the sick
fuck that's doing this?

1055
01:18:12,827 --> 01:18:14,029
Showcase number two.

1056
01:18:16,631 --> 01:18:17,664
No shit.

1057
01:18:17,666 --> 01:18:19,665
Police found him eating
the face off of some

1058
01:18:19,667 --> 01:18:22,668
young girl after he ran
her over with a truck.

1059
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:26,940
He blew his brains out before
they could take him in, so.

1060
01:18:26,942 --> 01:18:28,709
Halloween never disappoints,
does it?

1061
01:18:28,711 --> 01:18:30,811
And it looks like it's
just getting started.

1062
01:18:30,813 --> 01:18:32,012
Well, seeing as how I'm gonna
be here

1063
01:18:32,014 --> 01:18:34,384
for another 24 hours, thanks to
you,

1064
01:18:35,084 --> 01:18:36,917
you guys think you could
get me a breakfast sandwich

1065
01:18:36,919 --> 01:18:38,985
with bacon, or something with
bacon?

1066
01:18:38,987 --> 01:18:40,023
Bacon, really?

1067
01:18:41,023 --> 01:18:42,789
I thought you were
watching your cholesterol.

1068
01:18:42,791 --> 01:18:44,024
I am watchin' it.

1069
01:18:44,026 --> 01:18:45,491
Watchin' it go up.

1070
01:18:45,493 --> 01:18:46,826
Who's the MD around here?

1071
01:18:46,828 --> 01:18:48,594
How can you eat a greasy
croissant while

1072
01:18:48,596 --> 01:18:50,530
you're cutting up dead bodies?

1073
01:18:50,532 --> 01:18:51,530
Sweetheart.

1074
01:18:51,532 --> 01:18:53,566
I've been doin' this 22 years.

1075
01:18:53,568 --> 01:18:54,801
Alright, once you've
seen an eight month old

1076
01:18:54,803 --> 01:18:55,837
microwaved to death,

1077
01:18:57,739 --> 01:18:59,442
everything else is just old hat.

1078
01:19:01,710 --> 01:19:03,442
Look, you had to ask, alright?

1079
01:19:03,444 --> 01:19:04,945
I'll hook you up, doc.

1080
01:19:04,947 --> 01:19:05,882
That's my guy.

1081
01:19:07,683 --> 01:19:09,385
Stay safe out there.

1082
01:19:10,853 --> 01:19:14,323
(tense, dramatic music)

1083
01:19:20,395 --> 01:19:21,063
Jesus.

1084
01:19:22,497 --> 01:19:25,801
(tense, dramatic music)

1085
01:19:31,639 --> 01:19:34,943
Let's have a look at the man of
the hour.

1086
01:19:37,513 --> 01:19:40,817
(tense, dramatic music)

1087
01:19:45,787 --> 01:19:47,753
I hope your 15 minutes
of fame was worth it,

1088
01:19:47,755 --> 01:19:49,424
you sick son of a bitch.

1089
01:19:56,564 --> 01:20:00,702
(dramatic music)
(lights flicking)

1090
01:20:03,906 --> 01:20:06,676
(phone ringing)

1091
01:20:08,143 --> 01:20:11,578
[Woman] You're really
going to like it here.

1092
01:20:11,580 --> 01:20:14,082
(phone ringing)

1093
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:17,520
(screaming)

1094
01:20:30,565 --> 01:20:33,169
(dramatic music)

1095
01:20:38,105 --> 01:20:38,940
(coroner coughing)

1096
01:20:43,644 --> 01:20:46,079
(coroner screaming)

1097
01:20:46,081 --> 01:20:49,452
(tense, dramatic music)

1098
01:20:56,625 --> 01:20:58,191
Thanks again for everything,
doctor.

1099
01:20:58,193 --> 01:20:59,758
You'll be in our prayers.

1100
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,895
Please, don't mention it.

1101
01:21:01,897 --> 01:21:03,629
We're all gonna miss this one.

1102
01:21:03,631 --> 01:21:04,998
She's been so cooperative.

1103
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:06,866
Makes everyone laugh.

1104
01:21:06,868 --> 01:21:07,968
(laughs)

1105
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:08,602
Well she certainly hasn't
lost her sense of humor.

1106
01:21:08,604 --> 01:21:10,473
Yeah, still a wise ass.

1107
01:21:11,172 --> 01:21:12,038
It's good.

1108
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:13,573
It's a good thing.

1109
01:21:13,575 --> 01:21:15,174
It's important to stay positive,
right?

1110
01:21:15,176 --> 01:21:16,610
Absolutely.

1111
01:21:16,612 --> 01:21:17,744
Good spirits.

1112
01:21:17,746 --> 01:21:18,648
She'll be fine.

1113
01:21:19,881 --> 01:21:21,847
Well, take care of yourself,
Victoria.

1114
01:21:21,849 --> 01:21:23,115
I'll see you in a couple of
months.

1115
01:21:23,117 --> 01:21:24,049
[Victoria] Thank you, doctor.

1116
01:21:24,051 --> 01:21:24,920
You're welcome.

1117
01:21:25,854 --> 01:21:26,953
So long, doctor.

1118
01:21:26,955 --> 01:21:27,857
Good bye.

1119
01:21:29,925 --> 01:21:31,758
What do you say kiddo?

1120
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:32,625
You ready?

1121
01:21:32,627 --> 01:21:33,462
[Victoria] Yep.

1122
01:21:35,130 --> 01:21:36,295
[Doctor] Oh and, uh, good luck
with

1123
01:21:36,297 --> 01:21:37,666
your interview tomorrow.

1124
