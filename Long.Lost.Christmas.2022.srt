00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,049
*

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:17,017
* <i>I dream of Christmas</i>*

4
00:00:17,058 --> 00:00:23,690
* <i>snow flakes in the air</i>*

00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:25,358
*

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:28,194
* <i>I dream of Christmas</i>*

7
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,612
[Hayley] Here we go.

8
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,533
I am so glad you've joined me
for my favorite time of year...

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,869
the Christmas holiday.

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,788
If you’ve been following me
you know I’ve got great hacks

11
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,500
for holiday design but today
I wanna talk about embracing

12
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,544
the heart of the season.

13
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,963
The personal touch makes
all the difference

14
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,548
and Christmas is the time

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,885
to fill your space
with family traditions.

16
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:54,637
Felt stockings from second
grade... check.

17
00:00:54,679 --> 00:01:00,018
Homemade cranberry
popcorn strings... perfect.

18
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,022
And of course... the smell of
Christmas cookies.

19
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:06,608
Today I am baking
our family favorite...

20
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:08,109
candy cane cookies.

21
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,240
And last... the Christmas tree.

22
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:15,533
[laughs]

23
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:17,994
My dad set ours up the day
after Thanksgiving.

24
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,454
Though if it was up to him

25
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:22,123
he would've started around
Labour Day because...

26
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,585
Oh... wow...
[clears throat]

27
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:30,215
My regular followers know
I lost my dad

28
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:34,094
six months ago,
but he is...

29
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,846
such a part of what Christmas
means to me.

30
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:42,268
Every year, uh, we would put
together a train under the tree.

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,937
Now, it wasn’t fancy.

32
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,563
It ran off the tracks
half the time,

33
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,942
but it is everything
I’m talking about.

34
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,277
Personal and filled
with memories.

35
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:54,155
Now you know what to do.

36
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:57,701
I’m Hayley Brandt signing off
with a few holiday tips

37
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,495
and some unexpected emotions.

38
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,873
[sighs]
Wow.

39
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,502
[phone chimes]

40
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:17,971
[phone ringing]

41
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:20,223
Mrs. Peterson’s designer
showcase house,

42
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,975
Lolly Peterson speaking.

43
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:25,729
Mrs. Peterson, hi.
It’s Hayley Brandt.

44
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:27,647
Oh, wonderful.

45
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,483
I’ve had a designer fall out
of this year’s showcase.

46
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,236
How busy are you?
Say you’re not busy at all.

47
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:35,155
I'm sorry, are you asking me...

48
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:36,656
[Lolly] To take over one
of the rooms.

49
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:39,159
It's an impossible timeline,
our doors open

50
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,328
on New Year's day, but
it's fantastic exposure...

51
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,956
and it's for a good cause.
Say yes.

52
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:47,125
Yes. Yes.

53
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,585
How did you find me?

54
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,338
Well, everyone else is
on vacation or booked.

55
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,548
And then someone showed me
your... what's it?

56
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,632
Uh... live thing.

57
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,636
[Lolly] Vendors are in
short supply so you will
need to find resources.

58
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,971
Still a yes?

59
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,973
I will be there in half
an hour.

60
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,683
Oh! Merry Christmas to me.

61
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:07,729
[squeals]

62
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:11,566
[Hayley] The showcase house
is incredible.

63
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,777
You know how it works, each
designer gets assigned a room

64
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,863
to decorate in their own
distinct style and then people

65
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:20,075
buy tickets to see the house
and the proceeds go to charity.

66
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:24,454
Sarah, I got the study.
It’s huge!

67
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,247
But the other designers
are all really well-known,

68
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:27,749
it’s gonna be hard to stand out.

69
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,461
No, you’re gonna nail it
like you nail every other gig.

70
00:03:31,503 --> 00:03:32,504
I hope so.

71
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,507
Anyway... still on for later?

72
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:36,591
Uh... yeah.

73
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,385
I'm just dropping off food
to my mom.

74
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,220
I can't wait to see

75
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,262
what your mom’s house looks
like this year.

76
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,931
Me too.

77
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,852
Hi Mom.

78
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,690
Oh... I didn't realize
how late it got.

79
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,650
I’m sorry, I had to stop by
this work thing.

80
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:54,943
Hi sweetheart.

81
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,737
Uh, have you been home
all day?

82
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,365
I took the car to fix
that headlight.

83
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,200
I thought you were gonna get
out some Christmas decorations

84
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,660
and get started inside.

85
00:04:03,702 --> 00:04:05,120
I thought so too.

86
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,371
Well, I brought
you some dinner.

87
00:04:06,413 --> 00:04:08,289
And candy cane cookies,
your favorite.

88
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:12,127
It sounds like quite
an opportunity.

89
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,795
It’s launched all sorts
of big names.

90
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:16,589
It could really push me
to a whole new level.

91
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:19,801
Your dad...
would be so proud.

92
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,682
Let’s do the tree.
Maybe even get a few garland up.

93
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:30,270
You’re so supportive.
I just can’t find it in me yet.

94
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,439
Well, we have to try, right?
For Dad.

95
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,899
Yeah.

96
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,367
Shoot.

97
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:49,456
[sentimental music]

98
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,518
Hmm... who's Gordon?

99
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,480
Got some more good stuff.

100
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,319
Where’d you find that?

101
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:21,154
It was under some
storage shelves.

102
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,113
Was it yours?

103
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,408
I thought we lost that
in the last move.

104
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:37,504
That’s you in the picture.

105
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,007
It says Gordon on the back.
Who’s Gordon?

106
00:05:44,886 --> 00:05:46,137
He’s my brother.

107
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,016
You have... your...

108
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,603
I knew that you were adopted,
but...

109
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,064
He was older than me
by seven years.

110
00:05:57,524 --> 00:05:58,733
He looked out for me
the whole time

111
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,152
we were in the group
home together.

112
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,737
He aged out when I was 11.

113
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,407
And then what happened?

114
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,993
He had a hard time
finding his way.

115
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,915
[teary] He’d come back
and see me at first.

116
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,253
But he got into some trouble

117
00:06:18,294 --> 00:06:21,172
and eventually he just...
never came back.

118
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,175
When’s the last time
you saw him?

119
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,638
A few months before your
Grandma and Grandpa adopted me.

120
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,932
He would’ve been 19.

121
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,769
And no contact since, at all?

122
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:42,944
We could find him.

123
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,196
It's so much easier to find
people now.

124
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,489
We could start
with a name search

125
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:47,741
and if he has a business...

126
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:48,783
Hayley, stop.

127
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,119
Too much time has passed.

128
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,788
I made my peace
with it long ago.

129
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,915
Let it go.

130
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,043
Okay.

131
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,020
I can’t believe you still do
handwritten notes

132
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,438
in all your Christmas cards.

133
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,731
Well, you know what
I always say...

134
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:23,985
The personal touch...
-[both] is everything.

135
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:26,154
Listen, with the showcase...

136
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:27,572
You’re gonna be busier
than ever.

137
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:29,449
Yes, but I don’t wanna leave
you alone.

138
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,534
Especially during the holidays.

139
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:32,869
I’ll find my way.

140
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,623
I understand you need time,
Mom.

141
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:41,670
But... can you try to just get
out a little everyday for me?

142
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,839
I’ll try.
Just for my girl.

143
00:07:46,049 --> 00:07:48,009
How about a cookie?

144
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,763
Yes. Just for you.

145
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:53,014
[laughs]

146
00:07:54,808 --> 00:07:56,267
[Sarah] She has a brother?

147
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,311
So I have an uncle
all this time.

148
00:07:58,353 --> 00:07:59,479
How’s that possible?

149
00:07:59,521 --> 00:08:00,897
I don’t know.

150
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:02,857
How does someone never mention
they have a brother?

151
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,736
His name is Gordon Renton
and I have an idea.

152
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,363
I mean, how many Gordon Renton’s
could there be?

153
00:08:08,405 --> 00:08:09,823
Uh... think for a second.

154
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:11,908
If you take this step
you can’t go back.

155
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,993
She reads all day
in my dad’s sofa

156
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,287
and has barely decorated
for the holidays.

157
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,582
Maybe finding her long lost
brother is what she needs

158
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,042
to get moving again.

159
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:24,671
Or maybe this Gordon guy
stayed away for a reason.

160
00:08:24,713 --> 00:08:26,006
Maybe he’s a bad person.

161
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,341
Okay... or they lost
each other too soon

162
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:29,926
and he's dying to find her.

163
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:31,928
If I could bring them together
over Christmas

164
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:34,764
wouldn’t that be the most
amazing present?

165
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,018
Let me... let the expert
go to work.

166
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:43,148
Uh... what was the name of
your mom's group home again

167
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:44,566
and where was it located?

168
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,317
Right. It was, um...

169
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,069
Braithwaite and it was here
in Denver.

170
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:54,659
And the nearest high school
to Braithwaite is...

171
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,203
-East Barrington High.
-Okay.

172
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:58,913
[giggles]

173
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,291
Six names on one page?

174
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,962
Hayle? You okay?

175
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,173
Yeah, it's just...

176
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:12,385
Well, it's been me and my dad
and Mom for so long.

177
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,971
Now I could have more family.

178
00:09:17,599 --> 00:09:18,933
There are phone numbers.

179
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:21,269
-Here.
-Yeah?

180
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,896
Yeah.

181
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,398
Oh boy. Okay, this is happening.
This is really happening.

182
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,399
Alright.

183
00:09:26,441 --> 00:09:28,109
[phone ringing]

184
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,110
Here we go.

185
00:09:29,152 --> 00:09:30,278
Hi. I’m calling from

186
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,906
the East Barrington High
reunion committee.

187
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:36,117
Is this the same Gordon Renton
who graduated in ‘78?

188
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,204
Oh. Sorry.
Thanks for your time.

189
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:40,955
Okay.

190
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:42,082
Next one.

191
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:45,210
[phone ringing]

192
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,128
Hi. May I please speak
to Gordon Renton?

193
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:51,007
Oh... I'm so sorry
for your loss.

194
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,719
Scary how easy this is for you.

195
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:58,807
Three are in Maine,
Seattle and... Germany.

196
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,601
Only one other with
a Colorado area code,

197
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,145
a business called Timber
Grove Cabins.

198
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,232
Wanna try?

199
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,274
Oh. Uh...

200
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,734
[phone ringing]
It’s ringing.

201
00:10:11,903 --> 00:10:13,988
Timber Grove Cabins,
Gordon speaking.

202
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,700
Uh, hi. Is this, uh,
Gordon Renton?

203
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,327
Who’s calling please?

204
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:21,955
Mr. Renton I'm calling
on behalf of

205
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,749
East Barrington High School
reunion committee.

206
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,918
Uh, next year is your...

207
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:30,088
I’m sorry ma’am
but I got my GED.

208
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,006
Good luck to you though.

209
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,633
[sighs]

210
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:36,177
-He got a GED.
-Oh.

211
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:37,721
You know, but...

212
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,390
he didn't deny going
to East Barrington High.

213
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:44,144
He just said that he didn't
graduate from there, right?

214
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:47,022
I mean, come on, look.
Do you think they look the same?

215
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,900
Uh... that picture's
from 50 years ago.

216
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,821
Okay. Well his business says

217
00:10:54,863 --> 00:10:57,365
that it’s in a town called
Silver Valley.

218
00:10:58,533 --> 00:11:01,036
Isn’t Silver Valley
right near Aspen?

219
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,330
I think so.
It’s, like, four hours away.

220
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:07,751
I mean, I could take a day trip
there and meet him in person.

221
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,420
There are three other Gordons.

222
00:11:10,462 --> 00:11:13,673
Yeah, like in... Germany
or wherever.

223
00:11:13,715 --> 00:11:16,634
This one is in Colorado
where my mom grew up

224
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,803
and maybe where he grew up.

225
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,638
And this is something you have
to ask in person, right?

226
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,390
What are you gonna tell
your mom?

227
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:24,893
Nothing, until I know more.

228
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,021
Won’t she wonder why
you’re taking a road trip?

229
00:11:28,063 --> 00:11:32,734
I’ll say that I’m sourcing items
for my showcase house, right?

230
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,110
I have to do that anyway.

231
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:37,781
Look... if it's not him, I come
back, no harm done.

232
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,699
But if it is him...

233
00:11:39,741 --> 00:11:41,785
maybe I come back with her
long lost brother.

234
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,872
[hopeful music]

235
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:04,432
Okay.

236
00:12:05,392 --> 00:12:06,434
I think I can do this.

237
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,062
Oh, no.

238
00:12:09,104 --> 00:12:11,147
I... I can't do this.
I can't do this.

239
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,115
Okay.
I’m doing this.

240
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,118
I'm going to do this.

241
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,010
-Hi.
-Hi. Hello.

242
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,929
Uh... are you... you're not
Gordon Renton.

243
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:45,140
No, I’m not.
You must be from out of town.

244
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,683
I... I am.

245
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,560
And of course you're not him,
Gordon would be much older.

246
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,728
So, um...

247
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,229
[phone ringing]

248
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,398
I'm so sorry, can you...
can you just give me one sec?

249
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,733
Uh, yep. Yep.

250
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,817
[Jake] Hello?

251
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,402
One sec.

252
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,154
[Jake] Of course.

253
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,365
[Jake] Yeah.

254
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:04,075
[Jake] I’ll be there, yes.

255
00:13:04,993 --> 00:13:07,579
[Jake] Yeah. We’ll be open.
Okay. Great.

256
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,457
Oh no! I am...

257
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,791
Okay, bye.

258
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,794
I am so sorry.
I am not usually this clumsy.

259
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,504
I mean, I am.

260
00:13:16,546 --> 00:13:19,257
But usually people get to know
me first and then it’s okay.

261
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:20,175
It’s fine.

262
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:23,970
And just so you know,

263
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:26,348
the cabins we actually build
are much more sturdy than this.

264
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,891
[laughs]

265
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,853
Um... so, is Mr. Renton here?

266
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,480
You just missed him.

267
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,814
He left right before
you came in.

268
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:36,524
He's heading up
to the model cabin.

269
00:13:36,566 --> 00:13:37,776
Can I help you with anything?

270
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,070
Are you... interested
in building a cabin?

271
00:13:40,111 --> 00:13:45,450
No. I'm... looking
to rent a cabin.

272
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,993
-Oh.
-Yeah.

273
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:55,168
Uh... next spring actually.
A large cabin for a week.

274
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,671
Do you wanna head up
to the model cabin?

275
00:13:57,712 --> 00:13:59,005
You can look around.

276
00:13:59,047 --> 00:13:59,714
Oh...

277
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,924
Gordon will be up there.

278
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,259
Yes! Gordon... perfect.

279
00:14:03,301 --> 00:14:06,846
At the... at the cabin, that
would be... that'd be great.

280
00:14:06,888 --> 00:14:08,264
-Great.
-Yeah.

281
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:10,600
Follow me.

282
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:16,189
The road up can get pretty icy,
I’ll take you in my truck.

283
00:14:16,231 --> 00:14:17,607
Oh. Okay, great.

284
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:19,025
-Okay.
-Thanks.

285
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:23,613
[holiday music]

286
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:31,246
Yeah, we just
finished decorating

287
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:33,206
for our annual
Christmas fundraiser.

288
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:37,293
Gordon started it years ago.
It just keeps getting bigger.

289
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:46,177
Sorry, I’m an interior
decorator,

290
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,554
I couldn’t help but notice
this table.

291
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:48,722
Where did you get it?

292
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:50,265
Oh, my friend Brianna
designed it.

293
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,558
She’s got a workshop in town.

294
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:53,935
I could see if I’ve got a card
if you want.

295
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:54,686
That’d be great.

296
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,021
Yeah. Let me see.

297
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,615
My late wife carved that.

298
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:11,411
Incredible.

299
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,204
Yeah.

300
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,917
Here we are.
Brianna at Meadowlark Designs.

301
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,753
-Hey.
-Nice. Thank you.

302
00:15:19,794 --> 00:15:20,962
I have it on good authority

303
00:15:21,004 --> 00:15:23,465
she’s the best furniture
maker in Colorado.

304
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:24,632
Gordon, this is Hayley.

305
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:27,093
Hayley is an interior
decorator from...

306
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,428
Sorry, I didn't ask where
you're from.

307
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,429
Oh, Denver.

308
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:31,639
City girl. I spent
some time there.

309
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:35,393
She’s interested
in renting a cabin.

310
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:36,436
Nice.

311
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:39,773
Uh, yes.
For a reunion in the spring.

312
00:15:39,814 --> 00:15:41,733
What better place
than Silver Valley?

313
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:44,110
You’ve spent time here?

314
00:15:44,152 --> 00:15:47,489
Uh... well, not since
I was little.

315
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:49,783
Well, you drove a long ways.

316
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:50,950
Why don’t we go get lunch

317
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,452
and I can tell you more
about the area?

318
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,037
Yeah, that would be great.

319
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,622
Gordon, any chance
you’re free to join?

320
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:58,500
I’d love to hear more about
Timber Grove Cabins.

321
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:00,669
I could eat.

322
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:02,504
Great! Alright.

323
00:16:06,841 --> 00:16:08,593
How long have you had
the company?

324
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,969
Forty years this May.

325
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:12,389
Wow! And you...
you grew up here?

326
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,935
Sorry. I...
I ask a lot of questions.

327
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,603
I started my own business
two years ago

328
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:21,398
and I love hearing how
other people got started.

329
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,483
I built my family
in Silver Valley.

330
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:25,360
First place that felt
like home.

331
00:16:26,361 --> 00:16:28,780
How about you?
Is it a big family reunion?

332
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:34,994
Uh, the... the reunion is of,
um... neighborhood friends.

333
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,706
Yeah, we were all really,
really close.

334
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:38,957
So, Gordon...

335
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:39,958
Oh, what are you flagging
down reindeer

336
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,292
from the sky in that thing?

337
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:42,919
We have an ugly
sweater contest

338
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,088
at the festival committee
meeting later.

339
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,965
I... am winning.

340
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,968
You're definitely a shoe in.
Brianna, this is Hayley...

341
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,344
Hayley, Brianna.

342
00:16:51,386 --> 00:16:54,014
Hayley is an interior decorator
from Denver and...

343
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:58,685
Hayley Brandt?
I... watch your livestreams.

344
00:16:58,727 --> 00:16:59,728
You’re kidding?

345
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:01,938
Well I am crazy
about your table.

346
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,691
Like I said, best furniture
maker in Colorado.

347
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,401
Dad... stop.

348
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:07,569
[coughing]

349
00:17:07,610 --> 00:17:08,570
Are you okay?

350
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,240
Yeah... yeah. I'm good.

351
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:13,241
[laughs]

352
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:16,119
Well, it was so nice
to meet you.

353
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,371
I will definitely stop by.

354
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:21,207
Sounds great. I gotta grab a pie
for that meeting.

355
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,127
-See ya later.
-Bye! See ya.

356
00:17:26,338 --> 00:17:29,883
So, um... how old were you
when you left Denver?

357
00:17:29,924 --> 00:17:30,925
Sorry. Um...

358
00:17:32,344 --> 00:17:34,054
I forgot to ask Brianna
about that hutch she's making

359
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,597
for the Harrison cabin.

360
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,601
Personal touches are everything.

361
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,479
You guys have a good day.

362
00:17:44,064 --> 00:17:46,232
He’s a very private guy
so don’t be offended.

363
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,777
Yeah.

364
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,570
Hey, listen, I can definitely
help you find

365
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:53,531
a nice, big cabin for your
neighborhood reunion.

366
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,950
Oh, also there is a Christmas
festival tonight.

367
00:17:55,992 --> 00:17:58,244
The whole town turns up.
You should stick around.

368
00:17:58,286 --> 00:18:00,246
It might be a good way to get
a feel for the place.

369
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,501
Well, I do need more time.
Can you suggest a good B&B?

370
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:06,294
Yeah.

371
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,880
Yeah? Looks like I’m staying
the night.

372
00:18:14,219 --> 00:18:15,512
[Sarah] So now you have
an uncle,

373
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,556
a cousin and a potential
dating opportunity?

374
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,684
That’s pretty fast work
for one day.

375
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:22,769
Okay, can we get back
to Gordon please?

376
00:18:22,811 --> 00:18:24,562
Tell me you did more research.

377
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,897
The GED...

378
00:18:25,939 --> 00:18:28,650
there was a Gordon Renton
with a GED transcript

379
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:32,028
and it was the right year but...
it was in Kansas.

380
00:18:32,737 --> 00:18:35,365
There was an army vet sticker
on the back of his truck.

381
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,743
There are two army bases
in Kansas.

382
00:18:39,285 --> 00:18:41,955
Sarah, there are these
small things that he did

383
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,206
that are just like my mom.

384
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:45,166
You know how she folds
her towels?

385
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:47,752
[Hayley] He did it too.
What if it really is him?

386
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,254
Could be.

387
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:50,755
Oh!

388
00:18:53,008 --> 00:18:55,260
[hopeful music]

389
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:01,891
Patricia?

390
00:19:02,684 --> 00:19:04,352
Ellen... hi.

391
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:08,148
Oh, we haven't seen you in...

392
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:11,443
Oh, honey, I was so sorry
to hear about Henry.

393
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,737
What a terrible loss.
He was such a lovely man.

394
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,281
Are you holiday shopping?

395
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:18,825
I’ve got a few new novels
I could recommend.

396
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,286
Actually I was looking
for a Christmas card.

397
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:23,747
I remembered you have the
most beautiful selection.

398
00:19:24,497 --> 00:19:26,291
Just one special card?

399
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:28,960
Oh, here.

400
00:19:31,296 --> 00:19:32,630
How about this?

401
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,468
It’s perfect.

402
00:19:37,802 --> 00:19:40,638
[upbeat holiday music]

403
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,358
[laughs]

404
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,361
[children laughing and chatting]

405
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,780
Hayley! You made it.

406
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:58,198
Jake, hey.

407
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,533
You were right, everyone
really does turn out for this.

408
00:20:00,575 --> 00:20:03,370
-It's a pretty tight community.
-Yeah.

409
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:06,081
You'll see in the spring at
the arts festival as well...

410
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:07,123
for your reunion.

411
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:10,710
Uh... yes, right.
Spring reunion, yes.

412
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:12,295
Whoo!

413
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:13,838
Are you cold?

414
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,173
Yeah. It's, uh...

415
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,883
it's a lot colder than
I thought it would be.

416
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,260
And I didn't actually pack
for an overnight, so...

417
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,638
Kind of a spur of the moment
gal, aren’t ya?

418
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,722
Yeah.

419
00:20:23,682 --> 00:20:25,850
Alright.
Why don’t we get you a hat?

420
00:20:25,892 --> 00:20:27,519
-Oh... great.
-Okay.

421
00:20:28,478 --> 00:20:30,230
What the heck is that?

422
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,316
You’ve never seen cookies
on a stick before?

423
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,484
Tell me you buy cookies
on a stick.

424
00:20:34,526 --> 00:20:36,236
What kind of Christmases
did you have?

425
00:20:36,277 --> 00:20:37,654
The best, actually.

426
00:20:37,696 --> 00:20:39,531
My dad dressed up
like Santa one year.

427
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,908
He rented a sleigh
and delivered presents

428
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:42,909
around the neighborhood.

429
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,494
[laughs]

430
00:20:44,536 --> 00:20:46,246
My friends referred to him
as Santa Henry from then on.

431
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,039
What’s he gonna do to
top it off this year?

432
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,002
Oh... wow.
It is actually freezing.

433
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,044
Okay. Come with me.

434
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,713
Yeah.

435
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:59,509
I love hats. I love these hats.
I don’t know how to choose.

436
00:20:59,551 --> 00:21:01,219
How about this one?

437
00:21:01,261 --> 00:21:02,345
Oh...

438
00:21:02,387 --> 00:21:03,596
Always a fashionable
holiday choice.

439
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,181
Perfect, but only if you go
for this one.

440
00:21:05,223 --> 00:21:06,516
O-kay.

441
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:07,767
[laughs]

442
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:09,894
Oh, cute.

443
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:12,272
So cute.

444
00:21:12,313 --> 00:21:14,357
[laughing]
Oh, somehow not quite you.

445
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,483
It’s not me?

446
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,485
No. Maybe more
of an elf look.

447
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:19,279
Ooh, I’m not really much
of an elf guy.

448
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,613
-No?
-But I think you could be.

449
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,574
Oh, I could pull it off.
Let’s see.

450
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,661
Oh, it's fun.
It's maybe a bit over the top.

451
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,079
-It’s not over the top at all.
-No?

452
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,789
-It’s actually perfect.
-[laughs]

453
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,291
[Jake] Could we get the two
hats, please.

454
00:21:31,332 --> 00:21:34,419
Oh... there it is.
Right there.

455
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:36,212
Oh wait!

456
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:37,630
No. I... I've got this,
I'm the cold one.

457
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,258
No. I'm the one that asked you
to stick around, so.

458
00:21:40,633 --> 00:21:41,634
Do you know
what we should do?

459
00:21:41,676 --> 00:21:43,219
We should get
some hot chocolate.

460
00:21:43,261 --> 00:21:44,554
-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

461
00:21:44,596 --> 00:21:46,806
-Yes, but only if it is on me.
-Okay.

462
00:21:47,932 --> 00:21:49,434
Hey. Isn’t that Brianna?

463
00:21:49,476 --> 00:21:50,810
Yeah. Let’s go say hi.

464
00:21:50,852 --> 00:21:51,770
Okay.

465
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:53,772
Hey!

466
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,483
Hey. You stuck around.

467
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,568
Just got her a new hat,
she was a little cold.

468
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:00,153
I would’ve got you one

469
00:22:00,195 --> 00:22:01,529
but they didn’t have one
ugly enough for that sweater.

470
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,073
Hmm, you mean my
award-winning sweater?

471
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,741
You won?
What’d you get?

472
00:22:04,783 --> 00:22:07,077
-A really ugly trophy of course.
-Of course.

473
00:22:07,118 --> 00:22:09,913
You made all this?
This is amazing.

474
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,956
I’m a one-woman outfit.

475
00:22:11,998 --> 00:22:13,750
Wow. You must be crazy busy.

476
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:15,168
The Christmas stuff goes fast.

477
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:17,796
It’s the rest of the year
I’m trying to bulk up.

478
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:19,798
I keep telling her it’s only
a matter of time.

479
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:23,093
You two are cute together.

480
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:26,388
Thanks. I...
Wait, what?

481
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:28,723
What? Are you two not together?

482
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:29,766
-No.
-Oh?

483
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:30,975
No, no, no.

484
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,018
Are you kidding?

485
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,228
We've known each
other since forever.

486
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:35,230
-He's like my... brother.
-Sister, yeah.

487
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,857
He’s all yours...
if you want him.

488
00:22:37,899 --> 00:22:39,818
Oh, no... I'm not...

489
00:22:39,859 --> 00:22:42,320
Of course, you must have
a boyfriend-

490
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,905
Looking. Just like...

491
00:22:43,947 --> 00:22:45,407
[Grand Marshal] Welcome.

492
00:22:45,448 --> 00:22:48,910
Welcome everyone to the Silver
Valley Christmas festival!

493
00:22:48,952 --> 00:22:49,869
[cheers and applause]

494
00:22:49,911 --> 00:22:50,829
Yay!

495
00:22:51,538 --> 00:22:53,415
Have a jolly time
and win toys

496
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:56,543
to donate to the fireman’s
toy drive.

497
00:22:56,584 --> 00:22:57,836
[bells jingle]

498
00:22:58,378 --> 00:23:00,755
Plenty of elves here to help
gather the toys.

499
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:04,342
Merry Christmas!

500
00:23:04,384 --> 00:23:06,094
[cheers and applause]

501
00:23:06,761 --> 00:23:08,763
Hey, why don’t you go
win some toys

502
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:10,473
and I’ll get us some
hot chocolates?

503
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,017
-Deal.
-Great.

504
00:23:15,395 --> 00:23:16,563
Oh, try again.

505
00:23:19,858 --> 00:23:20,775
Oh, hey.

506
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,403
Well, hello. You stayed.

507
00:23:23,445 --> 00:23:27,449
Yeah, well Jake mentioned this
festival and I couldn’t resist.

508
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:29,034
I used to kill in this game.

509
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,453
Really?

510
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,912
Team up, win a toy together?

511
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:34,581
You’re on.

512
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,124
[laughs]
Alright, let's go.

513
00:23:37,167 --> 00:23:38,626
-Ready?
-Mmhmm.

514
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,549
[gasps]
Yes!

515
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,968
Fifty points, yes!
Okay. Ready?

516
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:47,886
Yeah, yeah.

517
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:50,889
[gasps]

518
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,973
Yes!

519
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,308
[laughs]

520
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:54,601
Two chances left.
We got this.

521
00:23:54,642 --> 00:23:55,727
Okay, we got this.

522
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:00,815
[gasps]

523
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:01,733
Yes!

524
00:24:01,775 --> 00:24:02,901
[laughs]

525
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:04,736
Alright. No pressure.

526
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,154
Okay.

527
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,206
Winner!

528
00:24:16,247 --> 00:24:17,749
[laughs] Yes!

529
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:20,710
[Attendant] Here is your prize.

530
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,672
Oh!

531
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,840
He reminds me of one I had
as a kid.

532
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:28,927
What about you?

533
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,262
You must’ve gone to a lot
of carnivals as a kid

534
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,014
in what, Kansas did you say?

535
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:35,934
I never, uh, never really
made it to anything like this

536
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,227
when I was a kid.

537
00:24:38,269 --> 00:24:39,270
Thanks for the game.

538
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:41,773
[sighs]

539
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:46,736
-Hey, you won!
-Hey. Yeah.

540
00:24:46,778 --> 00:24:47,946
Sorry that took so long.

541
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:49,531
I had to jump in front
of the line

542
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:51,116
and bribe a couple
of 10-year-olds.

543
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:53,410
You okay?

544
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:54,869
Yeah. You know what?

545
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:57,414
I’m just gonna drop this toy off
in the donation bin

546
00:24:57,455 --> 00:24:59,249
and head back to the B&B
if that’s okay.

547
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,418
Yeah. Do you want a ride?
I can give you a lift.

548
00:25:01,459 --> 00:25:02,877
Yeah, I’d like that.

549
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:05,755
Alright.

550
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:11,845
Dad, I got it. You're not
supposed to lift heavy things.

551
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:16,307
I know what my doctor said
as well as you do.

552
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:19,310
But in case you forgot, I run
a construction company,

553
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,812
I lift heavy things
all day long.

554
00:25:20,854 --> 00:25:23,440
Well, maybe you should stop
doing that.

555
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:27,402
Ah, not this again.
I’m fine now.

556
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:29,237
I worry about you.

557
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:32,365
I know you do, honey.
But you shouldn’t.

558
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,285
Maybe it’s time

559
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,704
to start thinking seriously
about retiring.

560
00:25:38,663 --> 00:25:39,998
You have Jake,
you know?

561
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,292
What would I do with myself
all day long?

562
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:45,003
I’d be bored to tears.

563
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:49,632
You are the most stubborn man
on the planet.

564
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:52,010
I know... but you still love me.

565
00:25:53,928 --> 00:25:55,805
Your work looks amazing,
by the way.

566
00:25:56,514 --> 00:25:57,724
Thanks Dad.

567
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,187
Have you been in Silver Valley
all your life?

568
00:26:02,771 --> 00:26:04,773
Mostly, yeah.

569
00:26:04,814 --> 00:26:06,983
Spent a little bit of time
in Chicago.

570
00:26:07,025 --> 00:26:08,735
I hear it’s a wonderful city.

571
00:26:09,361 --> 00:26:11,029
It wasn’t for me.

572
00:26:11,863 --> 00:26:14,324
But I came back here
and found my feet.

573
00:26:15,825 --> 00:26:18,161
Is that when you started
working for Timber Grove?

574
00:26:19,037 --> 00:26:21,790
Actually Gordon kind of
saved me.

575
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,709
I know he seems tough
on the outside but...

576
00:26:24,751 --> 00:26:27,712
once you get to know him
and get past all that, he's...

577
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,925
probably the most kind man
I've ever met.

578
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:35,720
He sounds incredible.

579
00:26:36,888 --> 00:26:37,639
Ah!

580
00:26:37,681 --> 00:26:39,808
Hey now, come on.

581
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,060
[laughs]

582
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:44,521
Did he hurt you?
Are you sure?

583
00:26:44,562 --> 00:26:46,231
[laughs]

584
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:49,192
-Wow.
-Wow.

585
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:58,660
So... are you gonna swing
by tomorrow

586
00:26:58,702 --> 00:27:00,870
and finalize your
reunion plans?

587
00:27:02,163 --> 00:27:03,289
I...

588
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:06,084
Sorry, not that I was selling
you on all this tonight

589
00:27:06,126 --> 00:27:08,253
or anything, like... this wasn't
about that, I just...

590
00:27:09,754 --> 00:27:11,131
I’ll definitely come by.

591
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:13,758
Great.

592
00:27:15,218 --> 00:27:16,344
[laughs]

593
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:40,285
[phone ringing]

594
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,167
Hi sweetheart.

595
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,210
How was today?

596
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,420
Good!

597
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,756
I went to the bookstore
and saw Ellen there.

598
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,425
[Hayley] Great. Did you buy out
the whole store?

599
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:56,968
Not the whole store.

600
00:27:57,844 --> 00:28:01,890
Mom, uh... I know it's
a touchy subject, but...

601
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,558
could I ask you more
about Gordon?

602
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:06,936
Sweetie, I just don’t wanna talk
about this.

603
00:28:06,978 --> 00:28:09,814
[Hayley] Yeah, I know. I know,
but...

604
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:13,318
you know, what could be so
terrible about more family?

605
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,529
Tell me how your day went.

606
00:28:17,489 --> 00:28:18,448
[sighs]

607
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:20,742
Um... actually...

608
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:23,453
I met a fantastic
furniture designer.

609
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:24,454
You would love her.

610
00:28:24,496 --> 00:28:26,039
Terrific.

611
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:28,124
[Patricia] You know, anyone you
find will be lucky you did.

612
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:29,209
I love you Mom.

613
00:28:30,168 --> 00:28:31,294
Love you more.

614
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,311
[cheerful music]

615
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:52,315
Morning!

616
00:28:53,108 --> 00:28:54,859
Hey, you’re up early.

617
00:28:54,901 --> 00:28:56,403
I just wanted to get
the shop cleaned up

618
00:28:56,444 --> 00:28:58,154
in case Hayley comes by.

619
00:28:58,196 --> 00:28:59,823
She’s not gonna care if your
workshop is messy.

620
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,533
Workshops are supposed
to be messy.

621
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:03,952
-You’re such a guy.
-You’re such a girl.

622
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,788
I just want it to look nice,
that’s all.

623
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,790
You do think she’ll stop by,
right?

624
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,459
Yes. Why are you so nervous?
She’s gonna love your work.

625
00:29:12,669 --> 00:29:13,795
I owe you a lot, you know.

626
00:29:13,837 --> 00:29:16,381
I know. Wait, why exactly?

627
00:29:16,423 --> 00:29:18,967
I never would’ve left Timber
Grove to start my own business

628
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:20,260
if you hadn’t been there.

629
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:23,221
I think you’re underestimating
your dad.

630
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:25,223
He would’ve shoved you
out the Timber Grove door

631
00:29:25,265 --> 00:29:26,891
if it meant making you happy.

632
00:29:26,933 --> 00:29:28,768
I’m concerned about him.

633
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:33,398
Since Mom died he seems lonely
and a little distant.

634
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,524
I know.

635
00:29:34,566 --> 00:29:35,984
I’m trying to take more
of the workload

636
00:29:36,026 --> 00:29:38,903
and I wanna talk to him
about some of my new ideas.

637
00:29:38,945 --> 00:29:41,489
Jake... don't talk,
just show him your cabin.

638
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:42,657
Not ready yet.

639
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,159
Ah... now who's nervous?

640
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,369
Not me.
Nope, not me.

641
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:47,620
Right, okay. Bye.

642
00:29:48,872 --> 00:29:51,416
[hopeful music]

643
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:58,631
Hey there.

644
00:29:59,716 --> 00:30:02,052
You came! Welcome.

645
00:30:02,886 --> 00:30:04,137
Mind if I look around?

646
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,057
Make yourself at home,
please.

647
00:30:08,266 --> 00:30:10,268
Your stuff is beautiful.

648
00:30:11,061 --> 00:30:12,437
How long have you been
at this?

649
00:30:13,813 --> 00:30:18,234
Forever.
My mom was a sculptor.

650
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:21,571
My dad gave me her tools
and told me to go for it.

651
00:30:23,615 --> 00:30:24,783
My dad was the same.

652
00:30:26,743 --> 00:30:28,745
He passed six months ago.

653
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:32,749
I'm so sorry.
Was he an artist, or...?

654
00:30:33,208 --> 00:30:34,376
An attorney actually.

655
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:36,252
But he'd totally say
he was an artist.

656
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:38,588
At Christmas he went all out.

657
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,425
He’s the one who encouraged me
to start my business.

658
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,552
Well, we come from
the same family.

659
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,471
Creative and encouraging.

660
00:30:50,892 --> 00:30:52,394
Um... you know what?

661
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:55,980
I actually have a project
coming up in the next few weeks.

662
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:58,483
Something along the lines
of this desk and chair

663
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:00,902
would be perfect.

664
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:03,571
It’s a showcase house
in Denver.

665
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,282
Wait, are you talking about

666
00:31:06,324 --> 00:31:08,785
Mrs. Peterson’s designer
showcase house?

667
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:09,494
Yeah!

668
00:31:10,745 --> 00:31:12,539
I’d love to be involved.

669
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,417
And if these aren’t exactly
right I can do sketches.

670
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:17,043
Would you?

671
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,379
Because I’ve got assigned the
study and it is all last minute.

672
00:31:19,421 --> 00:31:21,798
Of course. It’s such
a cool event.

673
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:24,634
I could get you sketches
by tomorrow.

674
00:31:25,885 --> 00:31:26,886
That fast?

675
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,848
I’ll run the sketches
over to you in the morning.

676
00:31:29,889 --> 00:31:32,058
That is if you’re staying in
Silver Valley another night?

677
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:32,976
[laughs]

678
00:31:33,018 --> 00:31:34,602
Sounds like I have to.

679
00:31:35,353 --> 00:31:38,481
Okay. Why don’t I meet you
at the café at 9:00 tomorrow?

680
00:31:38,523 --> 00:31:40,942
We can have a cup of coffee
before you go?

681
00:31:40,984 --> 00:31:43,278
Perfect.
Thank you.

682
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,279
[laughs]

683
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:45,572
Wow.

684
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,324
Oh, and hey, if I'm staying
another night,

685
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:50,660
could you tell me where
I could get some clothes?

686
00:31:50,702 --> 00:31:51,828
Yeah, absolutely.

687
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:54,664
I will, um... I'll text you.

688
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:55,749
Sounds good.

689
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,417
-See ya. Bye.
-Bye.

690
00:31:58,376 --> 00:32:00,920
Every year we would
make a train

691
00:32:00,962 --> 00:32:04,382
to put under the tree together
and it wasn’t fancy.

692
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:07,093
[Hayley] It ran off the track
half the time,

693
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,512
but it is everything
I’m talking about.

694
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,557
Okay.

695
00:32:23,485 --> 00:32:26,029
You’re back.
Did you need to make a return?

696
00:32:26,529 --> 00:32:29,491
No, no... I was thinking
about your story hour.

697
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:31,701
I remembered from teaching
that not every kid can come

698
00:32:31,743 --> 00:32:33,370
with their own stuffed toy.

699
00:32:33,411 --> 00:32:35,163
I wanted to donate one.

700
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:38,458
That is just like you.
So thoughtful.

701
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,836
We’re just about to start.
Do you wanna join us?

702
00:32:45,882 --> 00:32:47,258
I’ll just listen here.

703
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,470
Of course. You’re welcome
to listen any time.

704
00:33:01,981 --> 00:33:03,316
I’m telling you,

705
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:04,901
if Brianna lived in Denver
we would all be friends.

706
00:33:04,943 --> 00:33:06,861
A new bestie!

707
00:33:06,903 --> 00:33:08,571
[Haley] The three musketeers.

708
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:12,367
What if she is my cousin?
What if this is the real Gordon?

709
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,703
I want this so much
for my mother.

710
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:15,870
Just for your mother, huh?

711
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:18,289
Oh, hey, can I call you
back later?

712
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:19,708
Hey!

713
00:33:20,875 --> 00:33:22,877
Hey! I was wondering
when I’d see you.

714
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,463
You get a chance to drive by
those properties I emailed you?

715
00:33:25,505 --> 00:33:28,049
Oh, yeah, the whole morning
got consumed.

716
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:29,384
Right, working with Brianna.

717
00:33:31,636 --> 00:33:33,972
I... just, I was,
you know, research

718
00:33:34,014 --> 00:33:36,641
on my, our... potential
customer, so...

719
00:33:36,683 --> 00:33:37,600
Mmhmm.

720
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,436
Are you coming in?

721
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:40,937
-Yes.
-Alright.

722
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:45,400
Actually I dropped by to say

723
00:33:45,442 --> 00:33:47,736
thank you for walking
me home last night.

724
00:33:47,777 --> 00:33:48,945
[laughs]

725
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,449
We had a little run in
with a snowman last night.

726
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,075
It all happened very fast.

727
00:33:54,117 --> 00:33:55,368
Yeah, it attacked
without warning.

728
00:33:55,410 --> 00:33:56,911
Yeah, I had to fend it off
with my bare hands.

729
00:33:56,953 --> 00:33:58,371
[laughs]
It was terrifying.

730
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:00,457
Jake is a... is a hero.

731
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:01,541
Oh...

732
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:03,418
I’m glad the both
of you survived.

733
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:07,005
Hey, I noticed your truck
outside had a vet sticker on it.

734
00:34:07,047 --> 00:34:08,006
Did you serve?

735
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:11,968
Uh... my dad was in the army,

736
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:14,596
he never stopped talking about
the buddies he made in basic.

737
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,389
Where did you do your training?

738
00:34:17,182 --> 00:34:21,061
Uh, Kansas.
But that was a long time ago?

739
00:34:22,812 --> 00:34:23,730
Uh... cookie?

740
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:26,608
Whoa, no!
I am so sorry.

741
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:29,152
You know what?
I’ve got this, don’t worry.

742
00:34:29,194 --> 00:34:30,820
Oh look! One that didn’t break.

743
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:33,323
Five second rule?

744
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:36,451
Sorry. Doctor’s orders.

745
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:37,827
Oh.

746
00:34:40,538 --> 00:34:43,750
So, are you determined
to just destroy this office

747
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:45,877
or every office that you come
in contact with?

748
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:47,671
I, uh... I warned you.

749
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:49,547
Plus, I did bring cookies.

750
00:34:50,256 --> 00:34:51,549
To make fun of me.

751
00:34:52,175 --> 00:34:53,551
To make you smile.

752
00:34:56,763 --> 00:35:02,519
Uh, so, uh... that stuff
with Brianna...

753
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:04,813
does that mean that you're
staying til tomorrow?

754
00:35:04,854 --> 00:35:06,940
‘Cause there's a bunch of us
we are gonna head up

755
00:35:06,981 --> 00:35:08,900
to the lake tonight and
watch the meteor shower.

756
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,736
I could pick you up
if you wanted to come?

757
00:35:12,237 --> 00:35:13,738
Sure.
Yeah, it sounds fun.

758
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:15,824
I’ll see you later then.

759
00:35:16,491 --> 00:35:18,159
Yeah.
Thank you for these.

760
00:35:18,201 --> 00:35:19,369
[Hayley] Yeah.

761
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:30,839
-Those little faces.
-They just light up.

762
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,009
Especially this time of year,
so much magic.

763
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:35,427
Do you miss teaching?

764
00:35:35,927 --> 00:35:37,053
I didn’t when I retired.

765
00:35:37,637 --> 00:35:39,556
But Henry and I had
such big plans.

766
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:43,059
Now, I just feel kind
of rudderless.

767
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,187
You know, the store has
a tradition

768
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:47,981
leading up to Christmas Eve.

769
00:35:48,023 --> 00:35:50,817
We partner with a local shelter
and read to children

770
00:35:50,859 --> 00:35:53,653
who don't have a traditional
home over Christmas.

771
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:58,491
For a long time, growing up,

772
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,785
I didn’t have a traditional home
at Christmas.

773
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,913
I lived in a children’s home
called Braithwaite.

774
00:36:04,998 --> 00:36:06,458
We need readers.

775
00:36:06,499 --> 00:36:08,585
You might be the perfect person
for these kids.

776
00:36:18,887 --> 00:36:21,556
Closing papers on
the Schollander cabin.

777
00:36:21,598 --> 00:36:23,767
We are scheduled to start
right after Christmas.

778
00:36:25,435 --> 00:36:27,187
You did a good job
in this last sale.

779
00:36:27,228 --> 00:36:28,396
Thank you.

780
00:36:28,438 --> 00:36:30,899
Fact is, bringing you
into Timber Grove

781
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,693
was one of the smartest things
I ever did.

782
00:36:33,735 --> 00:36:35,570
Actually, you know, there are
a few new ideas

783
00:36:35,612 --> 00:36:37,489
that I kinda wanted
to run past you.

784
00:36:38,156 --> 00:36:41,743
Well, I’m pretty happy
how we’re doing things now.

785
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:44,412
But I would like to talk to you
about something.

786
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:45,622
What’s that?

787
00:36:46,998 --> 00:36:50,710
I'm... I'm not one to pry
into your personal life,

788
00:36:50,752 --> 00:36:53,088
so you can just tell me
it's none of business

789
00:36:53,129 --> 00:36:54,172
and I'll shut up.

790
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:55,048
Okay.

791
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:58,426
But I think you really like this
Hayley girl.

792
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:00,470
And if you do...

793
00:37:00,512 --> 00:37:03,139
I'd really hate to see you
just let that go by.

794
00:37:03,181 --> 00:37:04,974
She lives in Denver, right?

795
00:37:05,016 --> 00:37:07,268
I learned the hard way
that uprooting myself

796
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,270
for someone else
doesn’t work out.

797
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:12,524
I’m not convinced that’s what’s
holding you back.

798
00:37:12,565 --> 00:37:15,777
I know you got hurt big time

799
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:19,531
but at some point you’ve got
to decide to try again.

800
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:21,116
It’s not that easy.

801
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:22,909
Life isn’t easy.

802
00:37:22,951 --> 00:37:25,954
Take that from someone
who came up the hard way.

803
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,665
And so... love isn't easy.

804
00:37:29,791 --> 00:37:33,003
But it's the one thing
that makes life worth living.

805
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:36,840
You invited her up to
the lake tonight, right?

806
00:37:37,674 --> 00:37:40,510
I was being polite.
She’s your client.

807
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:42,137
[laughs]
Come on.

808
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:45,890
You were smiling at that gal
like your jaw was gonna bust.

809
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:49,394
How long are you gonna keep
your heart shut up?

810
00:37:49,436 --> 00:37:52,022
Even if I was ready
to open my heart...

811
00:37:53,648 --> 00:37:55,900
To her, I'm just
a construction guy.

812
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:57,861
Something wrong with that?

813
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:02,866
Jake...
she brought you cookies.

814
00:38:03,491 --> 00:38:05,910
In my day that was a date.

815
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,203
Hmm.

816
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:11,207
Maybe it’s time to take
a risk, huh?

817
00:38:16,254 --> 00:38:17,547
Hey, I can't talk long,

818
00:38:17,589 --> 00:38:19,174
I'm gonna check out a meteor
shower with Jake.

819
00:38:19,215 --> 00:38:20,759
[Sarah] What?

820
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,178
Wait a minute, now you’re going
stargazing with this guy?

821
00:38:23,219 --> 00:38:26,348
It's not like that.
And besides...

822
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:28,099
Besides what?

823
00:38:28,141 --> 00:38:31,936
Well, I mean, he is kinda fun.

824
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:34,356
This is like pulling teeth.
Who is this guy?

825
00:38:34,397 --> 00:38:36,066
What does he look like?
Is he cute?

826
00:38:36,107 --> 00:38:37,359
Is he smart? Funny?

827
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,652
Okay Sarah, we just met
a day ago.

828
00:38:39,694 --> 00:38:42,572
But he is tall, dark
and handsome.

829
00:38:42,614 --> 00:38:44,115
Always a good start.

830
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:45,325
And he makes me laugh.

831
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:46,701
Even better.

832
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:49,913
Okay, but back to Gordon,
because I do have news.

833
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:52,499
Gordon was in the army
in Kansas.

834
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:54,209
Why didn’t you just ask him
then and there

835
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,086
if he had a sister named
Patricia?

836
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:57,837
Because you were right.

837
00:38:58,755 --> 00:39:00,048
When I first came here

838
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,925
I thought I was just doing this
for my mom, but...

839
00:39:02,926 --> 00:39:05,220
now the stakes seem
so much higher

840
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:08,682
and I could see what it would
be like to have more family.

841
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,935
You really like these people,
don’t you?

842
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:14,020
I really do.

843
00:39:14,813 --> 00:39:17,899
What if it turns out Gordon
is not really your uncle?

844
00:39:17,941 --> 00:39:19,859
Yeah, I’m trying not to think
about that right now.

845
00:39:21,611 --> 00:39:23,196
You need to ask him, Hayles.

846
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:26,282
I know.

847
00:39:35,834 --> 00:39:37,502
Are you still open?

848
00:39:38,211 --> 00:39:42,048
I was just closing up
but come in, come in.

849
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,884
For your Christmas reading
program for disadvantaged kids.

850
00:39:44,926 --> 00:39:46,094
Oh.

851
00:39:46,136 --> 00:39:48,054
I thought maybe you could use
more books?

852
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:50,223
This is so generous of you,
Patricia.

853
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:52,392
Let’s put them in the hands
of children who need them.

854
00:39:52,434 --> 00:39:55,145
They’re not doing anyone
any good stored in my garage.

855
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,231
Shall we put them out
so the kids can find them?

856
00:39:58,273 --> 00:39:59,524
Yes. Yes, let’s do that.

857
00:40:00,567 --> 00:40:01,776
This is fantastic!

858
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:06,156
Oh, my goodness.
Look at this.

859
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:06,990
Ha!

860
00:40:07,615 --> 00:40:08,950
I’ve always loved Christmas.

861
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:12,203
How about this Christmas...
how you doing?

862
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:14,956
To be honest,
it's been awful.

863
00:40:15,373 --> 00:40:16,750
So sorry, Patricia.

864
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,918
Henry was my whole world

865
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,296
and now I have to create a whole
new world for myself.

866
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:24,049
Any ideas on what
that might be?

867
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:26,259
I need to find a sense
of purpose again.

868
00:40:27,093 --> 00:40:29,971
Your reading program
feels like a baby step

869
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,765
but in the right direction.

870
00:40:31,806 --> 00:40:34,726
So, I take it you’d like
to be a reader?

871
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:39,147
Yes, I would.
Very much.

872
00:40:40,565 --> 00:40:42,442
[cheerful music]

873
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:43,735
[Hayley] So, meteor shower.

874
00:40:45,195 --> 00:40:49,074
[Jake] Yeah. It’s the last
no moon night of the year

875
00:40:49,115 --> 00:40:50,825
which is when it’s best
to view them.

876
00:40:51,159 --> 00:40:54,162
There’s a bunch every
hour til, oh, 5:00 AM.

877
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:57,415
I’m staying up til 5:00 AM?

878
00:40:57,832 --> 00:40:59,334
I’m game if you are.

879
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:05,006
Silver Valley is definitely
showing off.

880
00:41:06,841 --> 00:41:08,301
Is that why you’re
sticking around?

881
00:41:09,886 --> 00:41:12,972
Actually your pal Brianna’s
making it impossible to leave.

882
00:41:13,014 --> 00:41:15,850
She’s gonna make my next
project amazing.

883
00:41:17,602 --> 00:41:20,355
Alright.
There you go.

884
00:41:22,691 --> 00:41:24,901
We’re all ready.
Should be any minute.

885
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:27,946
We’re ready!

886
00:41:28,697 --> 00:41:30,365
[laughs]

887
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,662
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't see anything.

888
00:41:35,704 --> 00:41:37,997
It's all dark and...

889
00:41:40,208 --> 00:41:41,084
[gasps]

890
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,255
Oh... wow.

891
00:41:46,715 --> 00:41:47,924
Isn't that beautiful?

892
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,135
I’ve never seen anything
like it.

893
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:55,974
Come here.

894
00:41:57,225 --> 00:41:58,101
What?

895
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:08,194
You've got snowman
cookie icing on your hat.

896
00:42:08,236 --> 00:42:10,447
[laughs]

897
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,032
Of course, I do.

898
00:42:13,366 --> 00:42:14,826
How is that possible?

899
00:42:14,868 --> 00:42:16,453
How did it get there?

900
00:42:16,494 --> 00:42:18,455
You really have to make a mess
out of everything, don’t you?

901
00:42:18,496 --> 00:42:20,165
[laughs]

902
00:42:25,253 --> 00:42:28,214
Hey, so... do you wanna
hang out tomorrow?

903
00:42:28,256 --> 00:42:31,092
After you get the drawings
from Brianna, or...

904
00:42:31,134 --> 00:42:33,595
do you have to, like...
head back?

905
00:42:33,636 --> 00:42:34,721
Yes.

906
00:42:36,222 --> 00:42:37,766
Yes, you have to head back
or yes, you want to hang out.

907
00:42:37,807 --> 00:42:39,184
[laughs]

908
00:42:39,225 --> 00:42:43,063
Yes, I... I would like
to hang out tomorrow.

909
00:42:48,276 --> 00:42:50,737
Hey, so I think there’s
a hot cider stand around
here somewhere,

910
00:42:50,779 --> 00:42:51,863
I could go get us a couple.

911
00:42:51,905 --> 00:42:52,947
-This one is on me.
-No.

912
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,532
-Yes!
-No, no!

913
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:55,867
-Not a chance!
-[both laughs]

914
00:42:56,451 --> 00:42:58,161
-Stay here, I’ll be back.
-Alright.

915
00:43:13,510 --> 00:43:14,719
I hear we’re a lot alike.

916
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:16,471
[laughs]

917
00:43:16,513 --> 00:43:17,764
Oh?

918
00:43:17,806 --> 00:43:20,183
You built your business
from scratch

919
00:43:20,225 --> 00:43:24,479
and I built mine two years ago
definitely from scratch.

920
00:43:24,521 --> 00:43:25,689
Please, have a seat.

921
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:30,652
Can I ask what made
you take the leap?

922
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:34,406
Well, I guess I finally found
something in this world

923
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:36,032
I was good at.

924
00:43:36,074 --> 00:43:37,283
How about you?

925
00:43:37,325 --> 00:43:39,452
Oh, I went the traditional
route.

926
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:44,666
College design program,
worked for a big designer

927
00:43:44,708 --> 00:43:46,251
and then I started
my own business.

928
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:47,711
Who’s idea was that?

929
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:50,130
My dad’s.

930
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:51,756
Nice.

931
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:53,383
He’s been gone now six months.

932
00:43:54,509 --> 00:43:55,885
I’m sorry.

933
00:43:55,927 --> 00:44:00,056
Just me and my mom now.
My dad didn’t have siblings.

934
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:05,729
I always wanted more family.
Did you ever feel like that?

935
00:44:08,857 --> 00:44:11,484
It’s hard when the ones we
think will always be there

936
00:44:11,526 --> 00:44:13,069
are taken from us.

937
00:44:13,903 --> 00:44:17,365
Families torn apart
by circumstance.

938
00:44:18,158 --> 00:44:19,409
Did that happen to you?

939
00:44:19,743 --> 00:44:20,702
Yes.

940
00:44:23,455 --> 00:44:25,790
When I lost my wife,
Brianna’s mom.

941
00:44:27,876 --> 00:44:29,419
Oh, I'm... I'm sorry.

942
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,255
I guess we have that
in common too.

943
00:44:32,964 --> 00:44:35,050
Surviving parent
and only child.

944
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,261
Were you an only child,
Gordon?

945
00:44:41,056 --> 00:44:42,557
I didn’t really have anyone.

946
00:44:44,642 --> 00:44:46,728
No brothers or sisters?

947
00:44:47,979 --> 00:44:49,147
No.

948
00:44:51,066 --> 00:44:54,069
Oh. That’s too bad.

949
00:44:56,946 --> 00:44:58,740
Ah, I'm sorry.

950
00:44:59,574 --> 00:45:01,034
Um... I told Jake

951
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:03,286
that I was gonna grab us
some hot cider, so...

952
00:45:03,328 --> 00:45:04,120
Of course.

953
00:45:04,913 --> 00:45:05,872
It was good to see you.

954
00:45:06,373 --> 00:45:07,665
It was very nice to see
you again.

955
00:45:17,008 --> 00:45:18,968
Hey! That took longer
than...

956
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:20,553
[crying] Oh! I'm sorry...

957
00:45:21,221 --> 00:45:23,348
-Are you okay?
-I just couldn't. I just...

958
00:45:24,057 --> 00:45:25,392
Hey, did something happen?

959
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:29,604
No, it's fine.
I just... yes.

960
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:33,358
The thing that I was hoping
for just...

961
00:45:37,112 --> 00:45:38,363
The truth is...

962
00:45:40,824 --> 00:45:42,617
The reunion I was planning...

963
00:45:43,952 --> 00:45:45,120
Isn’t real.

964
00:45:46,871 --> 00:45:49,207
You haven't looked
at any properties

965
00:45:49,249 --> 00:45:52,252
and your stories have been
a little vague on details.

966
00:45:52,293 --> 00:45:56,256
There was a reunion I was
planning, I was hoping for

967
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:59,342
but it's just... it's just
not gonna happen.

968
00:46:01,094 --> 00:46:02,262
Okay.

969
00:46:02,971 --> 00:46:04,723
Can we just head back?

970
00:46:06,057 --> 00:46:08,601
Yeah.
Yeah, let’s go.

971
00:46:15,734 --> 00:46:18,611
I, uh... I misled you
and I shouldn't have.

972
00:46:18,653 --> 00:46:19,446
I'm sorry.

973
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:21,656
No. No harm done,
really.

974
00:46:23,116 --> 00:46:24,409
You know what, I'm...

975
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:26,661
I'm gonna grab Brianna's designs
in the morning

976
00:46:26,703 --> 00:46:27,996
and then head straight home.

977
00:46:29,539 --> 00:46:30,915
I’ll admit, I was looking
forward to hanging out tomorrow.

978
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:33,293
Yeah, I just...

979
00:46:33,335 --> 00:46:34,794
I just think it's better
that I leave.

980
00:46:37,547 --> 00:46:38,506
Hayley...

981
00:46:41,259 --> 00:46:43,553
I like you. A lot.

982
00:46:46,681 --> 00:46:48,767
I like you. A lot.

983
00:46:49,434 --> 00:46:52,228
I just... it's complicated.

984
00:46:53,188 --> 00:46:56,983
Can I help?
Is there... something I can do?

985
00:46:57,025 --> 00:46:59,152
Jake, you are such
an amazing guy

986
00:46:59,194 --> 00:47:01,946
and I'm... I'm so lucky
to meet you but I just,

987
00:47:01,988 --> 00:47:03,698
I can't do this right now.

988
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,325
-I'm sorry.
-Ok.

989
00:47:08,953 --> 00:47:09,871
Goodnight.

990
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,416
Goodnight.

991
00:47:13,833 --> 00:47:14,876
Yeah.

992
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:23,927
[hopeful music]

993
00:47:25,136 --> 00:47:26,304
Hey.

994
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:32,018
Jake said you made the decision
to go a little abruptly.

995
00:47:32,727 --> 00:47:35,397
Oh... I'm... I'm sorry,
I should've...

996
00:47:35,438 --> 00:47:40,819
I just wanted to say...
the first Christmas is so hard.

997
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,570
I remember feeling so lost.

998
00:47:42,612 --> 00:47:43,947
No matter how old you are,

999
00:47:43,988 --> 00:47:46,449
losing a parent makes you feel
so small and alone.

1000
00:47:47,409 --> 00:47:50,245
So if that’s why you’re going,
I know what you’re going through

1001
00:47:50,286 --> 00:47:51,913
and you can call me any time.

1002
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:00,422
Do you mind?

1003
00:48:01,006 --> 00:48:02,007
No, of course.

1004
00:48:02,048 --> 00:48:03,508
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1005
00:48:05,552 --> 00:48:07,012
Oh, wow.

1006
00:48:07,595 --> 00:48:10,807
These are even better
than I imagined.

1007
00:48:10,849 --> 00:48:11,641
[Brianna] Really?

1008
00:48:11,683 --> 00:48:14,102
Yeah. Elevated and stylish.

1009
00:48:14,602 --> 00:48:17,063
I can use this desk and chair
as a centerpiece in my room.

1010
00:48:17,105 --> 00:48:18,273
Get out.

1011
00:48:18,314 --> 00:48:19,649
And the showcase posts
the names

1012
00:48:19,691 --> 00:48:21,317
of the artisans in every room.

1013
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,611
You are gonna get so much
traffic from this.

1014
00:48:24,696 --> 00:48:25,864
[phone ringing]

1015
00:48:26,823 --> 00:48:27,490
[gasps]

1016
00:48:27,532 --> 00:48:28,616
It’s Mrs. Peterson.

1017
00:48:30,035 --> 00:48:31,828
Mrs. Peterson, hi.

1018
00:48:31,870 --> 00:48:33,538
I am actually here

1019
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,041
with a wonderful new
furniture designer.

1020
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:38,752
Wh... What was that?

1021
00:48:41,212 --> 00:48:45,008
Err... but I thought... Oh...

1022
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:47,886
What happened?

1023
00:48:49,554 --> 00:48:53,016
The showcase got this big
name designer to do a room

1024
00:48:53,058 --> 00:48:56,394
but he would only do it
if he could have the study.

1025
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:58,438
Wait. They... they fired you?

1026
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,982
No... they gave me
the hallway.

1027
00:49:02,025 --> 00:49:05,028
It's a... small mudroom
at the back of the house.

1028
00:49:06,905 --> 00:49:10,241
But, I guess, I only got
the study in the first place

1029
00:49:10,283 --> 00:49:13,912
‘cause there wasn’t any more
established names available.

1030
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:17,791
Hey... stop.
It's not right, what she did.

1031
00:49:17,832 --> 00:49:20,502
But you'll design the heck
out of this space.

1032
00:49:20,543 --> 00:49:22,462
Anybody can decorate a study.

1033
00:49:22,504 --> 00:49:24,381
But when you make
hay outta this,

1034
00:49:24,422 --> 00:49:26,758
everyone will remember
who you are.

1035
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,429
[holiday music]

1036
00:49:32,138 --> 00:49:33,682
...And Merry Christmas to all.

1037
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:35,558
Perfect.

1038
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,644
How come you’re such
a good helper?

1039
00:49:37,686 --> 00:49:40,563
When I was your age I lived
at a place called Braithwaite.

1040
00:49:40,605 --> 00:49:43,483
I had a teacher who read
Christmas stories to us.

1041
00:49:43,525 --> 00:49:46,236
She helped us learn to write
by writing Christmas cards.

1042
00:49:46,277 --> 00:49:48,738
So when I grew up,
I became a teacher

1043
00:49:48,780 --> 00:49:51,074
so I could help kids learn
how to read and write.

1044
00:49:51,116 --> 00:49:54,077
I want to be a teacher too!
I’m gonna get another book.

1045
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:00,834
What a gift you are to them.

1046
00:50:00,875 --> 00:50:03,545
No, it’s they who’ve
given me the gift.

1047
00:50:03,586 --> 00:50:06,381
I was so wrapped up
in being sad.

1048
00:50:06,423 --> 00:50:09,134
Well, of course you were.
It’s only natural.

1049
00:50:10,176 --> 00:50:13,430
But Hayley was right, I needed
to get out of the house.

1050
00:50:13,471 --> 00:50:15,432
Being here with these children,

1051
00:50:15,473 --> 00:50:17,559
it’s given me back a sense
of purpose.

1052
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,274
-Where do you want this?
-Yeah, just right over here.

1053
00:50:24,315 --> 00:50:25,608
Okay.

1054
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:26,776
Oh, I can’t believe
how great it is

1055
00:50:26,818 --> 00:50:28,528
to work on a project
with someone else.

1056
00:50:29,487 --> 00:50:31,489
Running your own business
is so...

1057
00:50:31,531 --> 00:50:33,283
-Like being an only child.
-Lonely.

1058
00:50:33,324 --> 00:50:34,701
[laughs]
Yeah.

1059
00:50:39,164 --> 00:50:41,291
Hey... I'm not the story.

1060
00:50:41,332 --> 00:50:42,667
Yes, you are.

1061
00:50:42,709 --> 00:50:45,295
And if you want people
to know you, you have to...

1062
00:50:45,337 --> 00:50:46,296
[gasps]

1063
00:50:46,338 --> 00:50:48,173
Wait, I have an idea.

1064
00:50:49,174 --> 00:50:49,966
What are you doing?

1065
00:50:50,008 --> 00:50:50,967
We are going live.

1066
00:50:51,009 --> 00:50:52,302
-We are?
-Uh-huh.

1067
00:50:52,344 --> 00:50:53,470
Can you even do that from here?

1068
00:50:53,511 --> 00:50:55,764
As long as Sarah’s free
to run it.

1069
00:50:55,805 --> 00:50:57,349
I am a complete beginner.

1070
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,642
Oh, so was I.
Jump in feet first.

1071
00:51:00,352 --> 00:51:01,603
Sarah’s in. Are you?

1072
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:03,521
I guess.

1073
00:51:03,563 --> 00:51:04,981
Yeah!
Here we go.

1074
00:51:05,607 --> 00:51:07,567
Ready? Great.

1075
00:51:08,109 --> 00:51:09,819
Live in three... two...

1076
00:51:09,861 --> 00:51:12,989
Hey everyone, it’s Hayley Brandt
coming to you

1077
00:51:13,031 --> 00:51:16,826
from Meadowlark Designs here
in Silver Valley, Colorado.

1078
00:51:16,868 --> 00:51:18,787
[Hayley] We’re working together
to design a room

1079
00:51:18,828 --> 00:51:21,998
for Mrs. Peterson’s designer
showcase house,

1080
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:24,334
where you can support a great
cause and see work

1081
00:51:24,376 --> 00:51:27,796
from incredible designers like
my new friend Brianna here.

1082
00:51:27,837 --> 00:51:29,673
Now, you know what to do.

1083
00:51:29,714 --> 00:51:30,924
Say bye to everyone.

1084
00:51:30,965 --> 00:51:32,217
Merry Christmas!

1085
00:51:35,387 --> 00:51:37,639
That was so much fun.

1086
00:51:38,973 --> 00:51:40,141
[phone ringing]

1087
00:51:40,183 --> 00:51:42,060
Oh, and you are about
to get really busy.

1088
00:51:43,728 --> 00:51:45,605
Meadowlark Designs,
this is Brianna.

1089
00:51:46,648 --> 00:51:48,066
Who wants to go
tree shopping?

1090
00:51:48,608 --> 00:51:50,151
Yes, that does come
in other colors.

1091
00:51:51,111 --> 00:51:54,030
Hayley. Unfinished business?

1092
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:57,158
Uh, you could say that.

1093
00:51:58,535 --> 00:52:01,496
Jake, I don't think I'm going
tree shopping.

1094
00:52:01,538 --> 00:52:04,332
Um... this is unbelievable.
What am I gonna do?

1095
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:07,127
You're gonna stay here and keep
answering that phone.

1096
00:52:07,168 --> 00:52:10,922
And since your livestream
is responsible...

1097
00:52:10,964 --> 00:52:13,133
Oh, you saw that?

1098
00:52:13,174 --> 00:52:13,967
Oh, I...

1099
00:52:15,510 --> 00:52:16,970
You could make it up to me

1100
00:52:17,012 --> 00:52:19,973
by going Christmas tree shopping
in Brianna's place.

1101
00:52:21,891 --> 00:52:22,642
Deal.

1102
00:52:23,476 --> 00:52:24,644
-Go.
-Okay.

1103
00:52:27,063 --> 00:52:29,315
Wait a minute, you don’t have
a Christmas tree yet?

1104
00:52:30,525 --> 00:52:32,444
Are you just doing the math
on that now?

1105
00:52:32,485 --> 00:52:33,570
[laughs]

1106
00:52:33,611 --> 00:52:34,988
It’s just, it’s December 7th.

1107
00:52:35,030 --> 00:52:36,281
You seriously don’t have
a tree?

1108
00:52:36,322 --> 00:52:37,282
No, I don’t.

1109
00:52:37,615 --> 00:52:39,367
Okay, well we are gonna
fix that.

1110
00:52:39,409 --> 00:52:40,535
Yes, we are.

1111
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:42,245
That's actually why
we're here, so...

1112
00:52:42,287 --> 00:52:43,371
[laughs]

1113
00:52:44,122 --> 00:52:45,081
What do you think of this?

1114
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:46,416
Ah, it’s a little small.

1115
00:52:46,458 --> 00:52:47,334
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1116
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:48,293
Yeah.

1117
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:52,213
So, was construction always
your thing?

1118
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:56,134
I had no clue that this was
gonna be my future.

1119
00:52:56,885 --> 00:52:58,511
I feel really lucky actually

1120
00:52:58,553 --> 00:53:00,305
to have found Gordon
and Timber Grove.

1121
00:53:01,473 --> 00:53:02,265
Hmm...

1122
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:07,103
Yeah, before you said
he saved you.

1123
00:53:08,813 --> 00:53:12,275
Yeah, I was a bit of a wild kid,
I guess.

1124
00:53:12,776 --> 00:53:14,861
I felt like I never really
fit in anywhere, so...

1125
00:53:16,237 --> 00:53:17,155
So...

1126
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,367
Well... after college I got
into a relationship

1127
00:53:20,408 --> 00:53:25,622
and moved to Chicago and when
the relationship blew up,

1128
00:53:25,663 --> 00:53:27,665
my life kinda collapsed, so...

1129
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:31,503
I came home and joined
Gordon's construction crew.

1130
00:53:31,544 --> 00:53:34,339
He saw how hard I
was working and...

1131
00:53:34,381 --> 00:53:35,799
kinda took me under his wing.

1132
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:39,678
Well, he seems pretty great.

1133
00:53:40,136 --> 00:53:41,346
He can be tough

1134
00:53:41,388 --> 00:53:43,431
but it’s because he sees
something in you.

1135
00:53:44,391 --> 00:53:45,684
Now you’re his
right-hand man.

1136
00:53:45,725 --> 00:53:47,894
Yup. I mean, we do have
our differences, you know.

1137
00:53:47,936 --> 00:53:49,187
I wanna move the business
forward

1138
00:53:49,229 --> 00:53:51,189
with the stuff you’re
really good at.

1139
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,483
You know, creative promotions,
social media,

1140
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:55,694
but Gordon doesn’t see it.

1141
00:53:56,569 --> 00:53:58,655
Well, it’s just another way
for people to get to know you

1142
00:53:58,697 --> 00:54:00,657
and your story.

1143
00:54:00,699 --> 00:54:02,450
Exactly! Yes.

1144
00:54:04,035 --> 00:54:07,288
-You really love your work.
-So do you.

1145
00:54:08,164 --> 00:54:11,960
I guess we both just have big
visions for how things could go.

1146
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:13,962
Yeah.

1147
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,216
I think I found the one.

1148
00:54:19,217 --> 00:54:20,677
Tree. What do you think?

1149
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:22,887
[laughs]
Oh, right. Yes.

1150
00:54:23,722 --> 00:54:25,306
-That is the one.
-Yeah.

1151
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:38,695
Wow. This isn’t on the Timber
Grove website.

1152
00:54:38,737 --> 00:54:40,530
Nope.
I’m still renovating it.

1153
00:54:41,614 --> 00:54:44,117
I love it.
You did all this?

1154
00:54:44,576 --> 00:54:45,910
Well, with a lot of help
off hours

1155
00:54:45,952 --> 00:54:47,454
with the Timber Grove crew.

1156
00:54:47,495 --> 00:54:49,831
But yeah, I’ve been working
on it for a while.

1157
00:54:49,873 --> 00:54:50,957
It’s almost finished.

1158
00:54:50,999 --> 00:54:52,625
Obviously, I still need
some furniture.

1159
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,878
I thought you were living here?

1160
00:54:54,919 --> 00:54:58,131
I am but it’s also doing
double duty as a prototype.

1161
00:54:58,173 --> 00:55:01,217
I’m hoping that this will be
the company’s new direction.

1162
00:55:01,634 --> 00:55:02,927
You see the future.

1163
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:06,890
I see the future.
Open, airy, glass...

1164
00:55:08,558 --> 00:55:09,559
Of course, this sculpture.

1165
00:55:10,018 --> 00:55:11,353
Yeah, of course,
I remember it.

1166
00:55:11,394 --> 00:55:13,938
Sort of a... a symbol
for the company.

1167
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:15,357
So, has Gordon seen
this place?

1168
00:55:15,398 --> 00:55:17,400
Nope, not since I started
the interior.

1169
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:19,402
What if he sees all the work
you’ve done

1170
00:55:19,444 --> 00:55:22,155
and he’s just not interested
in changing?

1171
00:55:22,405 --> 00:55:24,032
Well, then...

1172
00:55:24,074 --> 00:55:26,201
I guess I just built a really
big house of my own.

1173
00:55:26,242 --> 00:55:27,744
[laughs]

1174
00:55:27,786 --> 00:55:29,162
Right.

1175
00:55:29,204 --> 00:55:30,747
And a house of my own
needs a Christmas tree,

1176
00:55:30,789 --> 00:55:33,458
so what do you say we go grab
that tree and get it decorated?

1177
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,834
Yes.

1178
00:55:34,876 --> 00:55:37,504
[holiday music]

1179
00:55:40,131 --> 00:55:40,715
[gasps]

1180
00:55:40,757 --> 00:55:42,592
So cute!

1181
00:55:42,884 --> 00:55:44,552
I totally should’ve gone
through these

1182
00:55:44,594 --> 00:55:46,346
before inviting you over.

1183
00:55:46,388 --> 00:55:47,389
No, I’m leaving.

1184
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:48,723
I never would’ve seen
your tree.

1185
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:51,351
Well, you say you’re leaving
but you never go.

1186
00:55:52,102 --> 00:55:55,230
Okay, I mean to.
I have to... tomorrow.

1187
00:55:56,064 --> 00:55:58,900
I think Silver Valley
has won you over.

1188
00:55:58,942 --> 00:56:00,610
Everybody gets sucked back in.

1189
00:56:01,277 --> 00:56:02,278
Like you did?

1190
00:56:02,862 --> 00:56:04,322
Well... that's different.

1191
00:56:06,074 --> 00:56:08,660
Brianna and Gordon...
I owe them a lot.

1192
00:56:09,244 --> 00:56:10,578
You’re lucky to have
each other.

1193
00:56:12,122 --> 00:56:12,956
Yeah.

1194
00:56:16,751 --> 00:56:19,421
You have a train
for your tree?

1195
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:21,006
Oh, right.

1196
00:56:21,047 --> 00:56:22,757
Yeah, that’s taken a real
beating over the years.

1197
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:24,050
Wow.

1198
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:26,636
I think... yeah.
I'm missing a caboose.

1199
00:56:27,345 --> 00:56:28,388
-What?
-Yeah.

1200
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:29,806
The best car.

1201
00:56:29,848 --> 00:56:32,142
In the movies all
the important stuff

1202
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:33,476
happens around the caboose.

1203
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:35,311
Chases.

1204
00:56:35,353 --> 00:56:36,938
Tearful goodbyes.

1205
00:56:36,980 --> 00:56:38,314
Reunions.

1206
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:42,360
The heart is in
that little red car.

1207
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:46,364
Hmm. I never thought of it
like that.

1208
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:55,999
So... you're heading back
to Denver tomorrow?

1209
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,962
Yup. After I see Brianna
in the morning.

1210
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:04,382
I don't know...
I don't know when I'll be back.

1211
00:57:06,009 --> 00:57:08,386
Thank you so much for helping me
with the tree and...

1212
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:10,680
Oh yeah. Um... sure.

1213
00:57:11,765 --> 00:57:14,142
And you have my email
if you wanna...

1214
00:57:15,602 --> 00:57:16,770
Okay.

1215
00:57:16,811 --> 00:57:18,688
Okay, um...
I'll grab my coat.

1216
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,524
Okay.

1217
00:57:28,615 --> 00:57:31,284
I wish you could stay for
the fundraiser tonight, but...

1218
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:33,870
I understand.

1219
00:57:33,912 --> 00:57:36,247
Well, we will celebrate
after the showcase.

1220
00:57:37,415 --> 00:57:39,334
Oh shoot.

1221
00:57:39,376 --> 00:57:41,795
I must’ve left my snowflake hat
at the thing the other night.

1222
00:57:41,836 --> 00:57:43,505
Oh, yeah.

1223
00:57:43,546 --> 00:57:45,048
Take the access road to the
highway, you’ll pass the lake,

1224
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:46,424
it’s on your way.

1225
00:57:47,008 --> 00:57:47,884
Where are you headed?

1226
00:57:47,926 --> 00:57:49,135
Oh, to the model cabin.

1227
00:57:49,177 --> 00:57:51,096
Gotta finish decorating
for tonight.

1228
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,934
Well, I hope you and your dad
have a Merry Christmas.

1229
00:57:55,975 --> 00:57:57,394
Same to you and your mom.

1230
00:58:23,628 --> 00:58:24,754
Oh, no.

1231
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,435
Hm. Let's see.

1232
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:41,813
Ah, there you are.

1233
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:45,108
[Gordon] Hayley!

1234
00:58:46,359 --> 00:58:48,653
Hey! Hey, I came back
to get my hat.

1235
00:58:48,695 --> 00:58:51,573
You’re just out here walking
in this cold?

1236
00:58:51,614 --> 00:58:53,033
[laughs]

1237
00:58:53,074 --> 00:58:55,493
Have a seat.
Enjoy the fresh air.

1238
00:58:58,830 --> 00:58:59,789
Ah...

1239
00:59:03,835 --> 00:59:05,378
This really is a beautiful town.

1240
00:59:06,254 --> 00:59:07,839
I can see why you found
yourself here.

1241
00:59:07,881 --> 00:59:09,591
Oh, you’ll be back.

1242
00:59:09,632 --> 00:59:12,761
You and Brianna are gonna
take the design world by storm.

1243
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:16,556
And Jake obviously
likes you.

1244
00:59:16,848 --> 00:59:18,767
Yeah, I don’t know
about Jake.

1245
00:59:18,808 --> 00:59:22,812
Well, if you're interested...
be a little patient.

1246
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:25,190
I’m not known
for my patience.

1247
00:59:25,607 --> 00:59:26,608
[laughs]

1248
00:59:26,649 --> 00:59:27,650
I get it.

1249
00:59:29,152 --> 00:59:32,655
But you know who you are.
And I suspect you always have.

1250
00:59:34,532 --> 00:59:36,951
It’s been a bit of a longer
road for Jake.

1251
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:38,286
He’s still finding himself.

1252
00:59:39,329 --> 00:59:41,498
But he's...
he's doing it on his own.

1253
00:59:42,582 --> 00:59:44,376
Sounds like you know
something about that.

1254
00:59:45,126 --> 00:59:46,836
I never really had a guide
in my life.

1255
00:59:48,088 --> 00:59:50,799
But it sounds like you’ve been
really lucky in your upbringing.

1256
00:59:51,508 --> 00:59:52,509
I was.

1257
00:59:55,178 --> 00:59:57,305
Gordon, I... have
a confession.

1258
00:59:57,806 --> 00:59:59,015
[laughs]

1259
00:59:59,474 --> 01:00:02,185
When I came here I had
this crazy idea.

1260
01:00:02,227 --> 01:00:04,771
It was far-fetched really,
that you were...

1261
01:00:05,855 --> 01:00:07,482
[struggling for air]

1262
01:00:07,524 --> 01:00:08,358
Gordon?

1263
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,698
Gordon? Gordon!

1264
01:00:14,739 --> 01:00:16,199
No. Gordon...

1265
01:00:16,825 --> 01:00:19,119
Hang on, hang on!
Hang on just a second.

1266
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,204
I'll get help. Okay.

1267
01:00:24,165 --> 01:00:25,542
I need an ambulance.

1268
01:00:29,212 --> 01:00:31,673
Hayley!
Thank God you were here.

1269
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:34,259
I... I... I can't imagine
what would've happened.

1270
01:00:35,510 --> 01:00:36,678
Is he okay?

1271
01:00:37,345 --> 01:00:38,596
I don’t know,
they haven’t said.

1272
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:41,850
The doctor should be out
in a few minutes.

1273
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:42,892
Come... sit.

1274
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:50,734
Renton family?

1275
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:54,446
Thank you, Hayley.

1276
01:01:03,329 --> 01:01:06,583
[sentimental music]

1277
01:01:26,144 --> 01:01:28,563
[emotional music]

1278
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:34,694
Someone wants to see you.

1279
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,450
My guardian angel.

1280
01:01:41,034 --> 01:01:43,036
You look a lot better
than when I last saw you.

1281
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:44,371
Thanks to you.

1282
01:01:44,412 --> 01:01:45,663
[Hayley chuckles]

1283
01:01:46,247 --> 01:01:48,708
Hey doc, you ready
to check me out?

1284
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,502
Not so fast.

1285
01:01:50,543 --> 01:01:52,045
From what Hayley said
when they brought you in,

1286
01:01:52,087 --> 01:01:53,672
you had a low blood
pressure event.

1287
01:01:53,713 --> 01:01:56,633
I just bent down
to pick up my gloves.

1288
01:01:56,675 --> 01:01:59,177
Well, if your head was anywhere
close to being below your heart

1289
01:01:59,219 --> 01:02:00,637
it can trigger low
blood pressure.

1290
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,222
And given your previous
heart attack,

1291
01:02:02,263 --> 01:02:04,099
we’re keeping you in a little
longer to adjust your meds.

1292
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:04,974
I can’t!

1293
01:02:05,016 --> 01:02:07,060
My fundraiser’s tonight.

1294
01:02:07,102 --> 01:02:08,353
You wanna go to a party?

1295
01:02:08,395 --> 01:02:09,896
I can’t disappoint the kids.

1296
01:02:11,106 --> 01:02:13,525
Look, I... I promise
to take it easy

1297
01:02:13,566 --> 01:02:15,735
and I'll keep my head
above my heart.

1298
01:02:16,569 --> 01:02:18,029
Come on, doc. Please.

1299
01:02:19,989 --> 01:02:23,284
If your numbers stay solid and
we can adjust your meds in time.

1300
01:02:23,326 --> 01:02:24,577
Then I’m trusting you.

1301
01:02:25,245 --> 01:02:26,746
Okay. Thanks doc.

1302
01:02:32,002 --> 01:02:32,919
Hey.

1303
01:02:34,921 --> 01:02:36,089
How are you doing, Gordon?

1304
01:02:36,464 --> 01:02:38,299
I hear the fundraiser
is still on for tonight?

1305
01:02:38,883 --> 01:02:41,469
-Absolutely it’s still on.
-Great.

1306
01:02:41,511 --> 01:02:44,639
Okay, yeah, about that.
We have a problem.

1307
01:02:44,681 --> 01:02:46,766
The heat is off
in the model cabin,

1308
01:02:46,808 --> 01:02:49,561
the pipes are frozen and there’s
water everywhere.

1309
01:02:50,186 --> 01:02:53,815
You mean you need another place
to hold the party tonight?

1310
01:02:57,235 --> 01:02:59,612
Jake... has a place
that you could...

1311
01:03:01,573 --> 01:03:02,824
Oh, just the cabin
I've been working on.

1312
01:03:02,866 --> 01:03:04,242
I mean, it's not quite
finished yet,

1313
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:05,285
so I don't know if we could...

1314
01:03:05,326 --> 01:03:06,536
It’s not just a cabin.

1315
01:03:06,578 --> 01:03:08,413
It is a beautiful space
that you have to see

1316
01:03:08,455 --> 01:03:09,789
and it’d be perfect
for tonight.

1317
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:13,918
Okay. We’ll do it there.

1318
01:03:14,794 --> 01:03:16,338
Alright.

1319
01:03:16,379 --> 01:03:18,798
I’ll blast out an email to
the guests with Jake’s address.

1320
01:03:19,632 --> 01:03:20,592
Great.

1321
01:03:24,304 --> 01:03:25,388
What did you just do?

1322
01:03:27,015 --> 01:03:28,558
It’s the ideal opportunity.
You’ll save the day for Gordon.

1323
01:03:28,600 --> 01:03:29,851
What’s the problem?

1324
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:30,977
Well, the problem is maybe
I wasn’t ready

1325
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:32,145
and you just volunteered me.

1326
01:03:32,187 --> 01:03:34,522
It's a remarkable space and...

1327
01:03:34,564 --> 01:03:37,150
if Gordon's open to expanding
the business at all,

1328
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:38,902
tonight is the night
to show it off.

1329
01:03:38,943 --> 01:03:41,571
And if not then
I’ve just blown my shot.

1330
01:03:42,655 --> 01:03:44,991
Yeah, you're...
you're absolutely right.

1331
01:03:45,033 --> 01:03:47,243
I'm... I'm sorry, I should've
asked you first.

1332
01:03:48,495 --> 01:03:50,080
Since you volunteered me...

1333
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:55,168
you can help me present it
in its best light.

1334
01:03:55,669 --> 01:03:57,212
You mean stage it for you
by tonight?

1335
01:03:57,837 --> 01:04:00,173
You’ve got seven hours.
You up for it?

1336
01:04:01,049 --> 01:04:02,717
You have no idea who you’re
dealing with.

1337
01:04:03,218 --> 01:04:04,886
Okay. Let's go get my jacket.

1338
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:09,641
...so we’ll do a donation table
along the side here.

1339
01:04:09,683 --> 01:04:12,435
And then conversation spaces
over here and here.

1340
01:04:12,477 --> 01:04:15,480
A couple tall tables
for drinks there.

1341
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:18,650
And of course, more
holiday decorations.

1342
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:22,487
Right. You think we can get
all of that done?

1343
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:24,531
A beautiful space
for party guests

1344
01:04:24,572 --> 01:04:25,990
to donate all their money

1345
01:04:26,032 --> 01:04:29,994
with a holiday vibe in...
six hours and 35 minutes?

1346
01:04:30,036 --> 01:04:31,162
You bet.

1347
01:04:32,247 --> 01:04:33,164
-Yeah.
-Mmhmm.

1348
01:04:33,540 --> 01:04:34,708
You know what to do.

1349
01:04:35,291 --> 01:04:36,835
I do not know what to do.
Do you?

1350
01:04:36,876 --> 01:04:38,003
No clue.

1351
01:04:38,044 --> 01:04:39,129
Okay, so I'll...

1352
01:04:40,755 --> 01:04:42,799
[upbeat holiday music]
*

1353
01:04:42,841 --> 01:04:57,772
*

1354
01:04:57,814 --> 01:05:12,704
*

1355
01:05:12,746 --> 01:05:12,912
*

1356
01:05:14,914 --> 01:05:18,835
Wow. I’m not gonna lie,
you’re really good at this.

1357
01:05:18,877 --> 01:05:20,295
[laughs]

1358
01:05:20,337 --> 01:05:22,172
I just need a few more
small candles

1359
01:05:22,213 --> 01:05:24,382
so I’m gonna head back
into town, see what I can find.

1360
01:05:24,424 --> 01:05:25,633
Okay. Great.

1361
01:05:25,675 --> 01:05:28,678
Hey listen, I just wanted
to say I was...

1362
01:05:28,720 --> 01:05:31,806
a little upset before
and I'm sorry about that.

1363
01:05:31,848 --> 01:05:34,225
You only get one shot.
I heard you.

1364
01:05:34,267 --> 01:05:36,269
I just wanna make it the best
shot possible, right?

1365
01:05:38,063 --> 01:05:38,980
Right.

1366
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:42,692
Also I, um...

1367
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:48,031
I wanna make Silver Valley
a place I come back to,

1368
01:05:48,073 --> 01:05:49,157
if that's something...

1369
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:50,367
Yeah. That's...

1370
01:05:56,331 --> 01:05:57,374
[Brianna] Hey, you two.

1371
01:05:57,791 --> 01:05:59,417
I could use a little help
in here.

1372
01:05:59,459 --> 01:06:00,752
[laughs]

1373
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:06,257
Alright, what’s going on
in here?

1374
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:08,968
Oh, these are all candy
cane cookies.

1375
01:06:09,552 --> 01:06:12,138
They're the only ones
my dad likes to eat.

1376
01:06:12,597 --> 01:06:14,849
They come out the easiest

1377
01:06:14,891 --> 01:06:16,267
[both] and you can hang them
off your finger

1378
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:17,686
when you eat them.

1379
01:06:18,311 --> 01:06:20,438
My mom always said that.

1380
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,148
My dad is obsessed.

1381
01:06:24,275 --> 01:06:26,778
Your... your dad had a heart
attack before today.

1382
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,030
It must've been so scary.

1383
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:31,449
I was with him when it happened
four years ago.

1384
01:06:31,491 --> 01:06:33,785
It was... terrifying.

1385
01:06:34,536 --> 01:06:35,912
I've been trying to get him
to scale back

1386
01:06:35,954 --> 01:06:40,625
but he's so stubborn and
protective of his business.

1387
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:41,793
I guess it makes sense

1388
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:44,004
after having such a rough start
in life.

1389
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,506
Yeah, he mentioned that.

1390
01:06:47,799 --> 01:06:51,428
He was in foster care and...
never got adopted.

1391
01:06:53,054 --> 01:06:55,015
I just want him to enjoy
his golden years.

1392
01:06:57,017 --> 01:06:58,018
Foster care?

1393
01:06:58,685 --> 01:07:00,061
He doesn’t like to talk
about it.

1394
01:07:00,729 --> 01:07:02,981
But I wish he’d let
Jake partner with him

1395
01:07:03,023 --> 01:07:05,734
and then take over
Timber Grove.

1396
01:07:07,819 --> 01:07:10,405
Yeah, that would be
the ideal solution.

1397
01:07:11,531 --> 01:07:13,658
Jake knows the business
inside and out

1398
01:07:13,700 --> 01:07:15,285
and he’d be perfect for it.

1399
01:07:16,828 --> 01:07:19,164
Alright, well I am gonna
head into town.

1400
01:07:19,205 --> 01:07:21,124
Can you think of anything
else we need?

1401
01:07:21,166 --> 01:07:25,003
No, you have already thought of
everything else.

1402
01:07:25,045 --> 01:07:26,087
Alright.

1403
01:07:27,297 --> 01:07:29,215
-Alright Jake, you’re up.
-[Jake] Okay.

1404
01:07:30,342 --> 01:07:34,763
[hopeful music]

1405
01:07:43,396 --> 01:07:44,481
[exhales]

1406
01:07:56,826 --> 01:08:00,330
[cheerful music]

1407
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:06,961
Who wants to party?

1408
01:08:08,213 --> 01:08:09,089
[Brianna] Hey Dad.

1409
01:08:11,174 --> 01:08:12,008
[Jake] Welcome.

1410
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:17,847
Oh... decent feel.
Very airy.

1411
01:08:20,183 --> 01:08:21,476
You’ll take a hit on
your heating costs

1412
01:08:21,518 --> 01:08:24,062
with those high ceilings
and all that glass though.

1413
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:27,065
Well, there's extra
insulation,

1414
01:08:27,107 --> 01:08:30,485
energy efficient thermostats,
lights, security...

1415
01:08:30,527 --> 01:08:32,862
and it can all be controlled
remotely from a phone.

1416
01:08:33,405 --> 01:08:34,823
[laughs]

1417
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:38,368
And of course...
the heart of the home.

1418
01:08:39,994 --> 01:08:42,247
It wouldn’t be a Timber Grove
cabin without it.

1419
01:08:43,248 --> 01:08:44,082
[exhales]

1420
01:08:45,542 --> 01:08:46,584
Spectacular.

1421
01:08:47,752 --> 01:08:50,255
Truly, it's... it's...
it's spectacular.

1422
01:08:53,508 --> 01:08:54,509
Well done, Jake.

1423
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:57,012
Thanks Gordon.

1424
01:08:57,846 --> 01:08:59,264
Now, how about a drink?

1425
01:08:59,681 --> 01:09:01,433
[all chuckle]

1426
01:09:01,474 --> 01:09:04,144
[peaceful music]

1427
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:08,148
[indiscernible conversations]

1428
01:09:13,069 --> 01:09:14,070
Wow.

1429
01:09:14,487 --> 01:09:17,240
You look... lovely.

1430
01:09:17,282 --> 01:09:18,533
You like it?

1431
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:19,576
I do.

1432
01:09:21,661 --> 01:09:23,163
You were right.

1433
01:09:23,204 --> 01:09:25,790
Silver Valley worked its magic
on me.

1434
01:09:25,832 --> 01:09:28,960
Why? You thinking of sticking
around... again?

1435
01:09:29,002 --> 01:09:32,380
I just can’t seem to leave
no matter how hard I try.

1436
01:09:32,422 --> 01:09:33,298
[laughs]

1437
01:09:35,633 --> 01:09:36,634
Dance with me.

1438
01:09:42,891 --> 01:09:43,975
[in unison] This is...

1439
01:09:44,768 --> 01:09:46,394
[laughs]

1440
01:09:46,436 --> 01:09:47,479
You go.

1441
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:48,563
No, you go.
Don’t worry about it.

1442
01:09:48,605 --> 01:09:50,690
I was just...
I was gonna say...

1443
01:09:54,110 --> 01:09:56,029
I can't believe what you did
with this place.

1444
01:09:57,947 --> 01:09:59,532
It’s better than I ever
could’ve dreamt.

1445
01:10:01,951 --> 01:10:03,119
It was easy.

1446
01:10:04,454 --> 01:10:05,705
I believe in you.

1447
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:09,000
Are you sure you gotta
go tomorrow?

1448
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:14,297
May I have your
attention please.

1449
01:10:18,301 --> 01:10:19,010
Welcome.

1450
01:10:20,428 --> 01:10:22,097
Thank you for taking time out
of your holiday season.

1451
01:10:23,306 --> 01:10:27,018
All of your efforts will help
Braithwaite’s mission

1452
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:31,022
to pair foster kids with homes
for the holidays.

1453
01:10:31,815 --> 01:10:33,608
And, of course, the times
in between.

1454
01:10:36,611 --> 01:10:37,987
Did you say Braithwaite?

1455
01:10:39,489 --> 01:10:41,449
That’s what this fundraiser
is for?

1456
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:43,368
Yes.

1457
01:10:44,911 --> 01:10:46,496
All this time you’ve been
raising money for Braithwaite?

1458
01:10:59,175 --> 01:11:01,011
Hayley!
Hayley, stop.

1459
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:03,638
Was she too much of a burden
to straight up abandon her

1460
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,639
and let her believe...

1461
01:11:04,681 --> 01:11:07,559
Let who believe?
Who are you?

1462
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:09,394
Patricia Renton’s daughter.

1463
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:13,106
Patricia?

1464
01:11:13,857 --> 01:11:14,983
The sister you left
at Braithwaite

1465
01:11:15,025 --> 01:11:16,359
and never came back for.

1466
01:11:17,193 --> 01:11:18,611
Did she... did she
send you?

1467
01:11:19,487 --> 01:11:21,781
No. She doesn’t know anything
about this.

1468
01:11:21,823 --> 01:11:24,409
And I’m glad now that I see
what kind of person you are.

1469
01:11:24,951 --> 01:11:27,203
What kind of a person
pretends to rent a cabin

1470
01:11:27,245 --> 01:11:28,621
just to get close to people?

1471
01:11:29,497 --> 01:11:32,459
You know, you could’ve asked.
Instead you just lied.

1472
01:11:33,251 --> 01:11:36,296
You said, "I don’t have
any siblings" right to my face

1473
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:37,756
but you did.

1474
01:11:37,797 --> 01:11:39,591
And you broke her heart.
What’s the bigger lie, huh?

1475
01:11:40,091 --> 01:11:43,136
Dad? What’s going on?

1476
01:11:43,178 --> 01:11:45,347
Go back inside.
I’m fine.

1477
01:11:45,847 --> 01:11:48,350
My mother Patricia
is amazing.

1478
01:11:48,391 --> 01:11:52,395
She is the kindest, best,
biggest-hearted woman I know.

1479
01:11:53,563 --> 01:11:55,523
You said you had no one.

1480
01:11:55,565 --> 01:11:58,693
But you had her...
and you just left her.

1481
01:12:02,113 --> 01:12:03,698
I’m sorry.
Thank you for everything.

1482
01:12:04,783 --> 01:12:05,825
[Hayley] I have to go.

1483
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,663
Dad, who’s Patricia?

1484
01:12:13,750 --> 01:12:14,793
What is going on?

1485
01:12:17,128 --> 01:12:18,213
Patricia...

1486
01:12:19,923 --> 01:12:21,424
Patricia is my sister.

1487
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:33,853
Dad, can we please
talk about this?

1488
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:36,731
There’s nothing
to talk about.

1489
01:12:39,192 --> 01:12:41,444
I made a decision
a long time ago

1490
01:12:41,486 --> 01:12:43,863
that I honestly thought
was the right thing to do.

1491
01:12:44,531 --> 01:12:45,615
What about Hayley?

1492
01:12:46,908 --> 01:12:48,910
Hayley left.
We gotta move on.

1493
01:12:49,244 --> 01:12:50,620
Move on from family?

1494
01:12:51,037 --> 01:12:53,206
Look, I don’t expect you
to understand.

1495
01:12:53,957 --> 01:12:56,167
But I need you to respect
my decision.

1496
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,754
You kept family from me, Dad.

1497
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:02,632
Look, Brianna...

1498
01:13:02,674 --> 01:13:06,970
There's stuff about your past
you don't wanna talk about...

1499
01:13:07,012 --> 01:13:09,264
Fine, that's your choice.

1500
01:13:10,807 --> 01:13:12,267
But you chose for me too.

1501
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:17,480
Goodnight Dad.

1502
01:13:21,192 --> 01:13:24,237
[emotional music]

1503
01:14:02,609 --> 01:14:04,235
...then she gave me
the mudroom.

1504
01:14:04,277 --> 01:14:06,738
I'm gonna make the best
of it, but...

1505
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:09,074
You are.
You always do.

1506
01:14:10,033 --> 01:14:12,118
But something more than work
is going on, isn’t it?

1507
01:14:12,786 --> 01:14:14,621
I’m just happy to be home
with you.

1508
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:18,083
That’s what family does,
stick together,

1509
01:14:18,124 --> 01:14:19,959
especially during the holiday.

1510
01:14:20,418 --> 01:14:22,921
And the place looks...
beautiful.

1511
01:14:24,172 --> 01:14:25,465
What changed?

1512
01:14:26,299 --> 01:14:28,301
Well, I finally figured out
you were right.

1513
01:14:28,927 --> 01:14:30,178
Staying home and mourning

1514
01:14:30,220 --> 01:14:32,055
didn’t alter the fact
your father was gone.

1515
01:14:32,847 --> 01:14:34,307
When I started volunteering,

1516
01:14:34,349 --> 01:14:36,476
some of that pain
began to lift.

1517
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:38,770
I needed a push
and you gave me one.

1518
01:14:39,771 --> 01:14:41,981
When I was little I used
to write a Christmas card

1519
01:14:42,023 --> 01:14:44,192
to Gordon every year.

1520
01:14:44,234 --> 01:14:45,902
But this year I wrote
a new one.

1521
01:14:47,153 --> 01:14:49,114
It won't reach him...

1522
01:14:49,155 --> 01:14:50,949
but I finally feel like
I've closed the door

1523
01:14:50,990 --> 01:14:52,158
on him being gone.

1524
01:14:52,742 --> 01:14:55,578
So... thanks for helping me
do that.

1525
01:15:00,750 --> 01:15:03,712
[peaceful music]

1526
01:15:04,838 --> 01:15:05,755
I can’t believe it.

1527
01:15:05,797 --> 01:15:06,840
When they took away
the study

1528
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:09,384
and gave me this room
I was so upset.

1529
01:15:09,426 --> 01:15:11,511
It’s called turning a lemon
into lemonade.

1530
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:13,638
Life is so funny,
isn’t it?

1531
01:15:13,680 --> 01:15:16,307
This was so much more
challenging than the study

1532
01:15:16,349 --> 01:15:17,767
and so much more fun.

1533
01:15:17,809 --> 01:15:19,477
I told you you’d knock
it out of the park.

1534
01:15:19,519 --> 01:15:21,604
-You ready?
-Let’s do this.

1535
01:15:25,191 --> 01:15:26,609
Hey everyone.

1536
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:29,904
Hayley Brandt coming to you
live with advanced peeks

1537
01:15:29,946 --> 01:15:33,241
from Mrs. Peterson’s designer
showcase house.

1538
01:15:33,283 --> 01:15:34,659
I can’t show you
the whole room,

1539
01:15:34,701 --> 01:15:36,953
you’ll have to wait
until opening day,

1540
01:15:36,995 --> 01:15:40,206
but I can tell you I have never
been prouder of any design

1541
01:15:40,248 --> 01:15:41,708
I’ve worked on.

1542
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,961
And just wait until you see
the incredible furniture

1543
01:15:45,003 --> 01:15:49,215
I’ve included from Brianna
Renton at Meadowlark Designs

1544
01:15:49,257 --> 01:15:51,760
located in beautiful
Silver Valley.

1545
01:15:52,677 --> 01:15:55,472
If you like what you see
I’d love to hear from you.

1546
01:15:55,513 --> 01:15:58,016
Merry almost Christmas, friends.

1547
01:16:29,964 --> 01:16:30,965
Brianna.

1548
01:16:32,133 --> 01:16:34,469
Can we stop pretending
nothing happened?

1549
01:16:43,311 --> 01:16:46,064
I hope Santa makes all
your wishes come true.

1550
01:16:46,106 --> 01:16:47,649
Merry Christmas Eve.

1551
01:16:49,984 --> 01:16:51,945
[children laughing]

1552
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:55,740
Your mother’s really made
these kids’ holiday.

1553
01:16:55,782 --> 01:16:57,826
I think that maybe
they’ve made hers.

1554
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:00,203
Want a teddy bear?

1555
01:17:01,287 --> 01:17:04,290
Patricia? Patricia.

1556
01:17:04,332 --> 01:17:05,959
We’re about to lose
a staff member.

1557
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:08,336
Our community partnership
person is leaving

1558
01:17:08,378 --> 01:17:09,713
at the first of the year.

1559
01:17:10,338 --> 01:17:12,257
-Merry Christmas.
-Oh...

1560
01:17:12,924 --> 01:17:15,385
Now can you think of anyone
better for the job

1561
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:16,928
because I certainly can’t.

1562
01:17:18,430 --> 01:17:20,682
Oh... that's great.

1563
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:23,143
Thank you.

1564
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:31,568
Who's car is that?

1565
01:17:34,654 --> 01:17:37,240
Mom, there’s something
I need to tell you.

1566
01:17:38,033 --> 01:17:41,578
Um... uh, the reason
that I went to Silver Valley

1567
01:17:41,619 --> 01:17:43,747
wasn't for furniture.

1568
01:17:51,004 --> 01:17:51,838
Patricia.

1569
01:17:54,215 --> 01:17:55,216
Gordon?

1570
01:17:56,843 --> 01:17:58,345
That’s what I was trying
to say.

1571
01:17:58,386 --> 01:17:59,679
What?

1572
01:18:01,514 --> 01:18:05,018
Hayley found me.
She found all of us.

1573
01:18:09,356 --> 01:18:11,858
This is your niece.
Brianna Renton.

1574
01:18:14,027 --> 01:18:16,112
And this is Jake Pierce,
my business partner.

1575
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:23,536
Could we, uh...

1576
01:18:30,752 --> 01:18:31,878
[crying]

1577
01:18:57,862 --> 01:19:00,907
I got in a lot of trouble
after I aged out.

1578
01:19:03,243 --> 01:19:06,788
I knew if I was a part of your
life, no one would adopt you.

1579
01:19:06,830 --> 01:19:11,251
I didn’t care about that.
I only wanted to be with you.

1580
01:19:11,292 --> 01:19:14,713
I could barely take care
of myself.

1581
01:19:14,754 --> 01:19:16,589
How could I take care
of an 11-year-old?

1582
01:19:18,842 --> 01:19:23,555
At my hearing a judge
gave me a choice...

1583
01:19:23,596 --> 01:19:27,809
Jail or the military...
and I enlisted.

1584
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:29,227
You could’ve
found me after.

1585
01:19:29,936 --> 01:19:31,563
All these years I thought
you must’ve died

1586
01:19:31,604 --> 01:19:33,106
or you would’ve come back
for me.

1587
01:19:34,190 --> 01:19:36,276
I am so sorry.

1588
01:19:37,152 --> 01:19:39,112
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

1589
01:19:39,821 --> 01:19:42,115
And I did...
I did come find you.

1590
01:19:43,742 --> 01:19:49,247
I learned that you had been
adopted by a wonderful family

1591
01:19:49,289 --> 01:19:50,790
and I didn’t wanna screw
that up.

1592
01:19:52,334 --> 01:19:55,879
And I thought after
all this time

1593
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,630
you wouldn’t wanna
see me anyway.

1594
01:19:58,465 --> 01:19:59,758
I did.

1595
01:20:01,343 --> 01:20:02,635
I always did.

1596
01:20:04,971 --> 01:20:07,140
I missed you so much
in my life.

1597
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:09,142
And I have missed you.

1598
01:20:10,643 --> 01:20:11,853
Will you stay?

1599
01:20:13,104 --> 01:20:15,273
Spend some of the holiday
with Hayley and me.

1600
01:20:17,942 --> 01:20:19,027
Absolutely.

1601
01:20:21,154 --> 01:20:22,280
Thank you.

1602
01:20:31,706 --> 01:20:33,792
I hear you’re a wonderful
furniture designer.

1603
01:20:34,125 --> 01:20:35,001
Thanks.

1604
01:20:35,335 --> 01:20:36,711
Best in Colorado.

1605
01:20:37,712 --> 01:20:41,257
Look Dad, peppermint candy cane
cookies, your favorite.

1606
01:20:42,467 --> 01:20:43,843
Old family recipe.

1607
01:20:44,427 --> 01:20:45,762
Maybe we could have some
for dessert.

1608
01:20:46,262 --> 01:20:47,180
Perfect.

1609
01:20:52,185 --> 01:20:53,311
I wanted to call.

1610
01:20:54,270 --> 01:20:55,188
Me too.

1611
01:20:56,398 --> 01:20:58,108
But the way I handled
things, I...

1612
01:20:58,817 --> 01:21:01,194
No, you did what you needed
to do.

1613
01:21:04,072 --> 01:21:08,034
But the thing between us...
that felt real.

1614
01:21:09,994 --> 01:21:13,748
A smart man made me realize
that closing myself off

1615
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:15,375
was a terrible way to live.

1616
01:21:16,793 --> 01:21:18,336
And you listened to him?

1617
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:28,888
So, if, uh... you're gonna be
working with Brianna

1618
01:21:28,930 --> 01:21:33,101
and you and your mom wanna
spend more time with Gordon...

1619
01:21:33,143 --> 01:21:35,729
and the distance between
Denver and Silver Valley

1620
01:21:35,770 --> 01:21:40,275
won't seem so far, if you
know... you're interested.

1621
01:21:40,316 --> 01:21:41,443
[laughs]

1622
01:21:47,115 --> 01:21:48,116
It’s about time.

1623
01:21:48,158 --> 01:21:50,076
[laughs]

1624
01:21:55,915 --> 01:21:57,250
[Patricia] It’s time for dinner!

1625
01:22:08,428 --> 01:22:09,763
I have something for you.

1626
01:22:12,849 --> 01:22:14,893
This is the last Christmas card
I wrote to you

1627
01:22:14,934 --> 01:22:16,353
after you disappeared.

1628
01:22:19,105 --> 01:22:21,107
And this is the one I wrote
to you this year.

1629
01:22:22,859 --> 01:22:25,278
After Hayley started asking
questions about you,

1630
01:22:26,321 --> 01:22:29,240
I never thought I’d be able
to give it to you in person.

1631
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:32,786
And I’m so very grateful
that I can.

1632
01:22:38,541 --> 01:22:39,459
Oh...

1633
01:22:48,176 --> 01:22:49,135
One second.

1634
01:22:57,644 --> 01:23:00,021
I wrote one by hand every year.

1635
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:04,109
I never sent them to you
but I thought about you

1636
01:23:04,150 --> 01:23:06,444
and I missed you
every Christmas.

1637
01:23:16,204 --> 01:23:17,205
To family.

1638
01:23:19,708 --> 01:23:20,875
To family.

1639
01:23:21,960 --> 01:23:23,878
[In unison]
Merry Christmas.

1640
01:23:30,343 --> 01:23:35,348
*

1641
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:56,953
*

1642
01:23:56,995 --> 01:24:09,924
*
