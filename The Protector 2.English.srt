1
00:02:14,457 --> 00:02:15,457
Kham!

2
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:19,000
What are you doing?

3
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:20,707
Easy, dude.

4
00:02:22,457 --> 00:02:25,042
Put the knife down.
Just tell me what you want.

5
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I did, Sergeant.

6
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,832
You ignored me.

7
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:30,542
Back off!

8
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:33,542
I won't, until you drop the knife.

9
00:02:34,207 --> 00:02:35,207
It's too late, Sergeant.

10
00:02:36,042 --> 00:02:37,042
I have no choice.

11
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,542
Kham! No!

12
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,957
I'll teach you "The Elephant",
Muay Thai's first technique.

13
00:03:05,707 --> 00:03:08,125
-What's this?
-The elephant's tusks.

14
00:03:09,167 --> 00:03:10,207
What about this?

15
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:13,667
-The trunk.
-The elephant's shaking it off.

16
00:03:14,207 --> 00:03:16,292
What is this called?

17
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:20,542
-The ears.
-The elephant's flapping his ears

18
00:03:20,792 --> 00:03:21,875
five times at once.

19
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,625
One, two, three, four, five.

20
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,292
Kham, you teach me only the dance moves.

21
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:32,207
What if we've been hit?

22
00:03:32,292 --> 00:03:34,000
Mud, come here.

23
00:03:34,667 --> 00:03:37,625
You're curious, right? Come here.

24
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,667
Want to know how?

25
00:03:41,042 --> 00:03:42,207
Check this out.

26
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:45,582
Which part of Khon that is
the strongest and most lethal?

27
00:03:46,042 --> 00:03:47,250
His tusks.

28
00:03:47,582 --> 00:03:49,332
Exactly. If so,

29
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:53,875
the key of "The Elephant" technique
is using our body's strongest part.

30
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,707
Our elbow.

31
00:03:56,792 --> 00:03:59,167
To defend and attack.
Hit me.

32
00:03:59,792 --> 00:04:01,667
Right here.

33
00:04:01,957 --> 00:04:04,207
Then, it's like twisting the trunk.

34
00:04:04,582 --> 00:04:06,207
Mud! Get home now!

35
00:04:08,082 --> 00:04:11,207
How many times have I told you
not to learn this nonsense?

36
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,917
Why don't you go to school?

37
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:19,000
How is this bullshit
any better than my stick?

38
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,625
Kham! I've said too many times
that your elephant

39
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,375
is not allowed at the market.

40
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,750
Look at the mess he's made.

41
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,708
If you want to keep that elephant,
live in the jungle.

42
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:31,916
Mud! You go home now.

43
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,666
Quick.

44
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:49,458
Khon, come on.

45
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:52,500
Khon, move.

46
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,916
Come here.

47
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,458
Kham.

48
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,416
I have something to show you.

49
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:11,291
Come on. This way, come here.

50
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,916
I want you to see this.

51
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,041
If you keep pulling pranks on me,

52
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:25,666
I'll tell the monk about this

53
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,416
and then you're out of here.

54
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:32,250
Please don't tell him.

55
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:35,458
The Lord Buddha said that
making an experiment

56
00:05:35,625 --> 00:05:38,666
requires a hypothesis,
trials and errors,

57
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:42,250
here and there,
then we can be successful.

58
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:44,958
Wait! Kham!

59
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,458
My ass.

60
00:05:49,625 --> 00:05:50,583
Ouch!

61
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:52,666
Ouch!

62
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:54,458
Come on.

63
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,166
Kham.

64
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,250
-Come on.
-Kham.

65
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:03,500
Stay hungry and foolish, Kham.

66
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,375
Stay hungry and foolish.
Keep that in mind.

67
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,708
I can guarantee that
you'll love that elephant, sir.

68
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,250
Sir, he's here.

69
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,958
Please.

70
00:07:12,791 --> 00:07:13,791
What do you think, sir?

71
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:18,458
He has excellent features
of the finest breed.

72
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,541
-His species--
-Enough. Too much information.

73
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:34,791
You'd better get the papers
for this gentleman.

74
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,375
Come on.

75
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,708
You touch him. I kick you.

76
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,250
No need to make a scene.
Just name your price.

77
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,916
Only a fool

78
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:48,625
-thinks money can buy anything.
-Hey.

79
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,666
You talk like that bitch
I fucked last night.

80
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:54,791
"You can't buy me." So what?

81
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:57,208
She was in the shower when I left.

82
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:00,541
Hey.

83
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,916
Suchart's interested.
It can be your best shot, man.

84
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,291
Your elephant
would have a better living

85
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,458
than in this wasted land.

86
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:14,208
-You can't even make a living.
-Pride has its price.

87
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,125
I'll ask you one more time

88
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:18,375
how much does this elephant cost?

89
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,250
Same price as your mom and dad's.

90
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:23,791
Hey!

91
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,000
Kham!

92
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:33,167
Dad has some coconuts for you
but you have to go and get them.

93
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,042
I'm talking business here.

94
00:08:35,917 --> 00:08:37,667
I don't want to threaten or hurt you.

95
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,042
Even I can do it.

96
00:08:41,207 --> 00:08:42,707
Give him my contact information.

97
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:53,667
Damn you. Only a fool loves his elephant
more than money.

98
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:55,667
That's a lot of money.

99
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,167
What a fool!

100
00:09:03,707 --> 00:09:05,000
Hey! Kham.

101
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:06,457
What's wrong?

102
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,457
Nothing.

103
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,082
I'm glad you're here.

104
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:13,625
Please watch Khon for me.

105
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:15,917
I'll be back. Come on.

106
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,375
Back when?

107
00:09:20,832 --> 00:09:22,375
Take these for me.

108
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,332
A male elephant, aged 40 years old,
weighing around two tons

109
00:09:26,417 --> 00:09:28,792
was found dead in crouching position
with his face down.

110
00:09:29,332 --> 00:09:31,249
All four legs were bent backwards

111
00:09:31,332 --> 00:09:35,624
and there was a long cut on his face
from his eyes to his mouth.

112
00:09:35,707 --> 00:09:38,375
The most notable point was
that his tusks were sliced off,

113
00:09:38,582 --> 00:09:40,457
as well as the tip of his tail.

114
00:09:40,707 --> 00:09:42,666
-In the middle of the forest...
-What the hell?

115
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,832
There was also a gunshot wound
about one centimeter wide

116
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,582
at the right side of his mouth.

117
00:09:47,707 --> 00:09:48,582
Look.

118
00:09:48,792 --> 00:09:50,917
I've just read the previous case
in the paper.

119
00:09:51,707 --> 00:09:53,417
Another dead elephant?

120
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,792
...before he was injured
and died at that spot.

121
00:09:57,042 --> 00:09:59,042
Officials have prepared...

122
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:03,042
ONE SHOT DEAD
WILD ELEPHANT POACHER

123
00:10:03,167 --> 00:10:05,500
...near the elephant's body.

124
00:10:05,832 --> 00:10:07,625
Piak, Pon. Thanks.

125
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,375
Job!

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,417
Kham! They're...

127
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:39,417
taking Khon.

128
00:10:45,457 --> 00:10:48,250
SUCHART WILAWANDET

129
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,832
Pinit, sir.

130
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,250
Is this line secured?

131
00:11:09,417 --> 00:11:10,500
Are you alone?

132
00:11:45,082 --> 00:11:46,000
Go on, sir.

133
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:47,957
You delivered that elephant?

134
00:11:48,957 --> 00:11:49,832
I did.

135
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,332
Just wondering,

136
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:52,667
we've plenty of elephants,

137
00:11:53,792 --> 00:11:55,791
why do they need this one?

138
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:58,832
Or you could ask
what do they want to do with him?

139
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,750
You don't want to know that.
Our job is done.

140
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:05,082
All I need to say is
we no longer know each other.

141
00:12:05,707 --> 00:12:08,500
I think you should lay low for a while.

142
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,582
-That's it.
-Sir.

143
00:12:44,582 --> 00:12:45,500
Where's Suchart?

144
00:12:45,792 --> 00:12:46,832
Second floor.

145
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,667
Uncle!

146
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,542
Uncle! Uncle!

147
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,125
You!

148
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,375
Stop!

149
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,167
I didn't kill him.

150
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,082
Follow him! Quick!

151
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:35,167
Ping.

152
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,417
Hands up!

153
00:14:49,707 --> 00:14:50,750
Sergeant Mark.

154
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:53,207
Kham.

155
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:01,417
Sergeant, you all right?

156
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm bleeding. Can't you see?

157
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,875
-Sergeant.
-Call the medic now.

158
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,125
Was it him?

159
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,332
I'm not sure.

160
00:15:19,042 --> 00:15:19,917
It's too fast.

161
00:15:20,667 --> 00:15:21,542
Ouch! It hurts.

162
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:24,625
There's no camera in this room.

163
00:15:26,042 --> 00:15:28,000
-But we've got enough evidence.
-Yeah?

164
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,207
You see that?

165
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,207
Of course. I'm not blind.

166
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,250
He was hit three times with a hard object.

167
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:41,042
A hard object?

168
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,125
-What kind of hard object?
-I think it's a man's fist.

169
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:47,207
You mean he was beaten to death?

170
00:15:47,707 --> 00:15:49,750
The killer must be a pro, Sergeant.

171
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:52,582
He knows martial arts.

172
00:15:52,957 --> 00:15:55,250
That's why he almost cracked your skull.

173
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:57,582
Lucky that you survived.

174
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,082
We're really grateful, Sergeant Mark,

175
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,582
for tipping us off with the leads
from Interpol.

176
00:16:04,042 --> 00:16:05,542
You even chased after the suspect.

177
00:16:09,792 --> 00:16:10,917
Are you kidding me?

178
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
You guys run like cripples.

179
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,500
So lame.

180
00:16:15,917 --> 00:16:18,167
-I couldn't stand it.
-Take it easy, Sergeant.

181
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:20,750
It's great that you helped us.

182
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,125
I want to fight with No.2.

183
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,707
What is this?

184
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,750
"Rank 31 wants to fight No.2?"

185
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,208
"That's a fucking suicide."

186
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:18,208
"Let me see him handle her first,
all right? Then we'll talk."

187
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,125
What? Her? Stronger than me?

188
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:52,416
Stop!

189
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,791
-Sergeant, what're you doing here?
-I should be the one asking you.

190
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,250
Why were you there?

191
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,791
-In Suchart's house.
-I was looking for Khon.

192
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:06,875
Looking for Khon?

193
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,333
You've lost your elephant again?

194
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,916
Is he that small?
He disappears all the time.

195
00:20:15,166 --> 00:20:16,083
Sergeant, listen.

196
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,166
Suchart and his men went to my place

197
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,000
to buy Khon.

198
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:23,375
I said no.

199
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:26,333
When he left, Khon was missing.

200
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,000
So, you killed him?

201
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:30,208
You talk like you don't know me.

202
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,208
That's because I know you.

203
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,333
I know your madness.

204
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:38,666
Lucky you,
I still believe that you're naive.

205
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,250
That's why I didn't turn you in.

206
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:45,083
Kham!

207
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:46,708
You can't go anywhere.

208
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:48,875
Sergeant, if you're not gonna help me,

209
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,166
stay out of my way.

210
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:53,041
You might think that

211
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:54,791
Khon is just an elephant.

212
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:56,958
But for me,

213
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,416
he is my little brother.

214
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:04,416
Your dad fucked an elephant?

215
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:05,708
You!

216
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:09,875
Hands off!

217
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:13,625
Get off me.

218
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:19,166
I don't want this

219
00:21:20,583 --> 00:21:22,083
and I have something to tell you.

220
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,208
Tomorrow, the leader of Katana

221
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:28,458
will visit Thailand.

222
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,125
There will be a terrorist attack.

223
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,750
That's why I'm here.

224
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,208
Then I met you

225
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,958
unexpectedly.

226
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,416
Kham.

227
00:21:40,666 --> 00:21:42,541
I can help you if you trust me.

228
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,916
Tell me the truth.

229
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,208
What truth?

230
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:47,666
I know nothing.

231
00:21:55,166 --> 00:21:56,791
Take it easy, girls. Easy!

232
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:18,958
Asshole!

233
00:28:23,791 --> 00:28:24,958
Get him!

234
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,291
Fuck you!

235
00:31:23,416 --> 00:31:24,375
Move.

236
00:31:26,458 --> 00:31:27,583
Cars!

237
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:28,708
Hold it!

238
00:36:40,791 --> 00:36:46,248
MEET ME AT THE SHIPYARD,
MARK

239
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,875
SENDING

240
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,833
Let me go! Let me go!

241
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:51,583
Who are you people?

242
00:36:52,583 --> 00:36:53,791
-Let's go!
-Hey!

243
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,208
I can't breathe, asshole!
Let me go!

244
00:37:21,375 --> 00:37:24,625
...please leave a message.

245
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:31,333
...please leave a message.

246
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,125
Stop it.

247
00:40:13,916 --> 00:40:15,041
Wait.

248
00:40:28,625 --> 00:40:29,541
Stop!

249
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:35,000
I didn't kill him.

250
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:01,500
Do we need to babysit him?

251
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,625
Hey! He told me to get rid of him.

252
00:47:18,208 --> 00:47:19,458
Let me eat this first.

253
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,166
Shit. It's me again?

254
00:47:25,166 --> 00:47:26,958
Damn you.

255
00:47:27,541 --> 00:47:28,916
You ruin my lunchtime.

256
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,750
Should I cut your ears off?

257
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:36,708
Make it quick.
Just stab him in the neck.

258
00:47:38,875 --> 00:47:39,958
What the hell?

259
00:47:44,625 --> 00:47:45,541
Hey!

260
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:47,833
Why did you guys kill my uncle?

261
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,500
Easy, girl. Calm down.

262
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,083
Why did you do that? Why?

263
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,791
You don't look like one of them.

264
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,666
Call Lieutenant Kong for me.

265
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:09,875
Lieutenant Kong.

266
00:48:11,458 --> 00:48:14,875
I told you he'll be here.
Who's that? Is she with you?

267
00:48:17,083 --> 00:48:18,333
The victim's family.

268
00:48:20,416 --> 00:48:21,416
Can I go now?

269
00:48:22,208 --> 00:48:23,250
I'm feeling so stiff.

270
00:48:34,916 --> 00:48:36,041
As you can see,

271
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:37,833
he was killed

272
00:48:38,166 --> 00:48:39,958
by the lethal attack
at three vital spots

273
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:41,833
almost at once.

274
00:48:42,916 --> 00:48:45,416
His xiphoid process was cracked

275
00:48:45,875 --> 00:48:47,541
so he couldn't breathe.

276
00:48:48,125 --> 00:48:49,125
He bent down

277
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:52,375
but he was hit by the second blow

278
00:48:52,541 --> 00:48:53,875
at his neck

279
00:48:54,583 --> 00:48:56,083
so his windpipe got ruptured.

280
00:48:57,166 --> 00:48:59,666
The victim lowered his head by reflex

281
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,791
to get the final blow

282
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:04,125
at the top of his head.

283
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,833
That's the nerve center of our body.

284
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:10,958
In short,

285
00:49:11,833 --> 00:49:13,250
the one who did this

286
00:49:14,458 --> 00:49:15,875
must be a professional killer.

287
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,625
I'm sleepy. I'm go to bed now.

288
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:28,500
Turn off the lights, okay?

289
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:30,416
Yeah.

290
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,625
She's not the injured one.

291
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,958
Take good care of Khon, my boy.

292
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:03,250
Keep in mind that he is

293
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:04,625
a divine elephant

294
00:50:06,083 --> 00:50:07,625
from Akkanipong's family.

295
00:50:08,791 --> 00:50:09,958
Promise me

296
00:50:12,583 --> 00:50:16,000
that you will take care of him
the best you can.

297
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,416
Don't worry about Khon, Dad.

298
00:50:19,875 --> 00:50:20,916
I'll protect him

299
00:50:21,916 --> 00:50:23,041
with my life.

300
00:51:00,083 --> 00:51:01,375
Finally we meet you.

301
00:51:02,958 --> 00:51:04,208
I'm a big fan of you.

302
00:51:06,375 --> 00:51:09,583
Especially what you did in Sydney.

303
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:11,416
Superb.

304
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,958
For the past five years,
I've been quite disappointed.

305
00:51:22,541 --> 00:51:25,583
You live like a country boy
eating sugarcane.

306
00:51:28,083 --> 00:51:31,500
That's not a life
for a man with your skills.

307
00:51:36,416 --> 00:51:38,541
I decided to give you a job
in my organization.

308
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:41,708
You get a lot of money...

309
00:51:43,791 --> 00:51:44,833
...a lot of pussy...

310
00:51:47,333 --> 00:51:49,125
...and all the coconut you can eat.

311
00:51:51,083 --> 00:51:52,291
What do you say, Kham?

312
00:52:05,666 --> 00:52:07,125
You said no?

313
00:52:11,375 --> 00:52:12,500
You need to be persuaded

314
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:14,208
by something else, perhaps.

315
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:24,083
Kham!

316
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:27,250
Job!

317
00:52:31,958 --> 00:52:33,166
Join us, or your friend dies.

318
00:52:34,708 --> 00:52:35,791
He'll count to three.

319
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:38,625
One.

320
00:52:42,083 --> 00:52:42,958
Two.

321
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:44,750
Wait! Wait! Stop!

322
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,291
Too late, too late indeed.

323
00:52:53,958 --> 00:52:55,000
A fighter should be fast.

324
00:52:59,958 --> 00:53:00,833
That's okay.

325
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:04,833
One more chance.

326
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:09,000
One more surprise.

327
00:53:12,625 --> 00:53:13,625
Khon!

328
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:15,916
Untie me!

329
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:46,708
Kham.

330
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:52,000
Stay hungry and foolish.

331
00:58:10,958 --> 00:58:12,750
You're killing your elephant.

332
00:58:13,125 --> 00:58:15,083
If you do it again, your elephant is dead.

333
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,125
Wait.

334
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:43,541
What's happening?

335
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,208
Kham!

336
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:19,708
What are you doing?

337
01:01:23,375 --> 01:01:24,291
Drop your knife!

338
01:01:25,625 --> 01:01:26,500
Kham.

339
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:27,958
Trust me.

340
01:01:28,708 --> 01:01:29,625
Put it down.

341
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:31,666
What do you want?

342
01:01:32,166 --> 01:01:34,125
-Just tell me.
-I did, Sergeant.

343
01:01:36,041 --> 01:01:37,083
You ignored me.

344
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:38,791
Step back!

345
01:01:39,166 --> 01:01:40,041
I won't

346
01:01:40,416 --> 01:01:41,708
until you drop the knife.

347
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:44,000
It's too late, Sergeant.

348
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:45,833
I have no choice.

349
01:01:46,833 --> 01:01:48,791
Kham! Don't! Kham!

350
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,833
Ouch! Wait!

351
01:02:57,083 --> 01:03:00,125
Damn it.
You're not gonna ask me, are you?

352
01:03:00,333 --> 01:03:02,248
What do you know? Tell me.

353
01:03:02,333 --> 01:03:04,583
Okay. I will. Easy, dude.

354
01:03:05,125 --> 01:03:06,000
Well,

355
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:08,666
Boss says you won't make it.

356
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:10,291
They will be here to kill you.

357
01:03:12,583 --> 01:03:14,583
I just came to check
that you're dead for sure.

358
01:03:14,666 --> 01:03:16,041
That's all I know, okay?

359
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:18,250
You guys are not going to
give my elephant back, right?

360
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:19,958
Where's my elephant?

361
01:03:21,041 --> 01:03:22,541
What else? Tell me everything!

362
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:24,123
Tell me everything.

363
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:27,666
Okay. I will.

364
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:42,583
They're gone. Come out.

365
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:51,791
Sergeant,

366
01:04:54,041 --> 01:04:55,041
will you help me?

367
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:57,541
What happened to you?

368
01:05:24,333 --> 01:05:25,708
I've lost a lot of my men.

369
01:05:26,875 --> 01:05:29,458
-It's not worth it.
-Take it or leave it.

370
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:38,791
Let's go.

371
01:05:52,083 --> 01:05:53,541
You're such a troublemaker.

372
01:05:54,958 --> 01:05:56,958
Are you my lost brother or what?

373
01:05:57,583 --> 01:06:00,123
I have to protect you
and help you over and over.

374
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:01,125
Easy.

375
01:06:07,958 --> 01:06:08,833
Here.

376
01:06:18,125 --> 01:06:19,208
Wipe your blood with this.

377
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:21,208
I knew it.

378
01:06:21,708 --> 01:06:24,791
-You didn't do it.
-Why do you want to help me?

379
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:27,000
You finished your job?

380
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:30,791
My job is over,

381
01:06:33,208 --> 01:06:34,375
as much as my life.

382
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:36,750
Darn it.

383
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:39,041
I'll help you get your elephant back.

384
01:06:39,833 --> 01:06:41,166
Perhaps my life is worthy.

385
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:45,791
The guy that you beat him up,
what did he say?

386
01:06:45,916 --> 01:06:48,166
He said Khon will be delivered
to Phuket tonight.

387
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:51,333
-Phuket...
-Tonight General Dutafi,

388
01:06:51,416 --> 01:06:53,625
the leader of newly established
West Katana,

389
01:06:53,958 --> 01:06:55,291
will make a visit to Thailand.

390
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:58,625
After more than ten years of negotiation

391
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:03,416
between Katana's government
and the separatists.

392
01:07:03,708 --> 01:07:05,875
Finally, the war between them
is coming to the end.

393
01:07:06,541 --> 01:07:09,041
East Katana requires Thailand's government

394
01:07:09,250 --> 01:07:12,041
to prepare a banquet in Phuket
and a native elephant

395
01:07:12,125 --> 01:07:15,375
as a special gift for West Katana.

396
01:07:21,625 --> 01:07:22,541
To where?

397
01:07:24,041 --> 01:07:26,083
My job hasn't finished yet.

398
01:07:27,750 --> 01:07:28,750
The problem is

399
01:07:31,125 --> 01:07:32,458
you're on a run.

400
01:07:37,916 --> 01:07:39,083
Now you get on a flight.

401
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:53,750
Step back.

402
01:25:24,667 --> 01:25:27,292
You are such a dick
for that stupid elephant.

403
01:25:33,500 --> 01:25:36,542
Who'd have thought that
an elephant could be a bomb?

404
01:26:30,500 --> 01:26:32,750
Attack as fast as you can
hit him both high and low...

405
01:26:33,375 --> 01:26:34,582
Shut my ass up.

406
01:26:35,500 --> 01:26:38,000
Shut my blind ass up.

407
01:29:19,332 --> 01:29:22,042
Sergeant, there is a bomb with Khon.

408
01:29:23,082 --> 01:29:24,000
Holy Shit.

409
01:29:53,417 --> 01:29:57,792
There's a bomb. A bomb!
The elephant! Run!

410
01:29:58,082 --> 01:29:58,957
Run! Quick!

411
01:29:59,875 --> 01:30:00,957
Run! Quick!

412
01:30:05,082 --> 01:30:06,792
Run! Quick!

413
01:30:56,000 --> 01:30:57,582
Move! Quick!

414
01:30:58,957 --> 01:30:59,917
Sergeant!

415
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:02,125
Let's go.

416
01:31:12,082 --> 01:31:14,623
-Job!
-Hey! Kham!

417
01:31:14,707 --> 01:31:18,000
-What the hell are you doing?
-I don't know.

418
01:31:18,332 --> 01:31:21,917
-No idea. I didn't do it.
-It's you!

419
01:31:26,042 --> 01:31:28,500
-People could die.
-How can we remove it?

420
01:31:29,042 --> 01:31:32,542
-How?
-I can't at this point.

421
01:31:33,042 --> 01:31:36,332
If the tusks are off, the bomb goes off.

422
01:31:41,667 --> 01:31:42,750
Don't be scared, Khon.

423
01:31:52,167 --> 01:31:53,250
Hey! Put it back.

424
01:31:54,582 --> 01:31:56,042
What should we do, Sergeant?

425
01:31:56,542 --> 01:31:59,207
I've seen how they deactivate a bomb.
Today is the real deal.

426
01:32:10,582 --> 01:32:11,542
Calm down, Khon.

427
01:33:30,457 --> 01:33:31,875
Come here.

428
01:33:36,832 --> 01:33:38,125
-What now, Sergeant?
-Back off.

429
01:33:38,542 --> 01:33:42,332
-Now, Khon. Go back.
-Khon, turn around.

430
01:33:47,082 --> 01:33:49,750
Kham, you hold his tusks.
I'll take care of this.

431
01:35:53,750 --> 01:35:54,625
Sergeant,

432
01:35:56,792 --> 01:35:57,957
would you help me?

433
01:37:48,832 --> 01:37:49,707
Kham.

434
01:37:53,957 --> 01:37:54,917
Kham.

435
01:38:35,000 --> 01:38:35,957
Kham.

436
01:39:50,082 --> 01:39:51,500
I'm exhausted in this scene.

437
01:39:52,707 --> 01:39:54,542
Exhausted.

438
01:39:59,957 --> 01:40:01,292
Your skirt didn't get ripped.

439
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,957
Sergeant!

440
01:40:20,250 --> 01:40:21,750
I don't want this, Khon.

441
01:40:22,292 --> 01:40:23,750
-Cut!
-Kham!

442
01:40:25,542 --> 01:40:27,042
What's wrong with you?

443
01:40:29,292 --> 01:40:31,542
You have ringworm?

444
01:40:31,667 --> 01:40:34,082
You need an ointment, man.

445
01:40:34,167 --> 01:40:35,167
Action!

446
01:40:38,917 --> 01:40:40,207
-Sorry.
-I'm all right.

447
01:40:40,292 --> 01:40:41,957
Don't cry. Be a man.

448
01:40:42,042 --> 01:40:43,707
Don't show your pain.

449
01:40:56,875 --> 01:40:58,375
You can run.

450
01:41:01,582 --> 01:41:03,207
Camera's up.

451
01:41:07,832 --> 01:41:09,625
Stand by.

452
01:41:11,417 --> 01:41:14,042
Tony Jaa is leaving.

453
01:41:20,667 --> 01:41:21,875
Ready, pull.

454
01:41:25,667 --> 01:41:28,250
Keep pulling.

455
01:41:54,167 --> 01:41:55,375
Hands off!

456
01:42:01,167 --> 01:42:02,832
I'll take you to a theme park.

457
01:42:06,667 --> 01:42:08,332
Can't get my gun.

458
01:42:09,625 --> 01:42:11,292
I don't want this, Kham.

459
01:42:13,457 --> 01:42:16,042
You need to...

460
01:42:25,042 --> 01:42:26,625
-The shoes...
-Want to take them off?

461
01:42:27,582 --> 01:42:29,750
-You can take them off.
-Just take them off.

462
01:43:06,625 --> 01:43:07,792
Tell me the truth.

463
01:43:09,042 --> 01:43:10,167
I can't focus.

464
01:43:16,667 --> 01:43:17,707
What's this?

465
01:43:22,625 --> 01:43:24,042
This is a comedy movie though.

466
01:44:07,417 --> 01:44:09,417
