Till one summer, a terrible sickness
spread through the land.

It was so fierce
even the strongest warriors fell ill.

203
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,959
They were on the verge of death.

204
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,635
So, all the chiefs met
to see what they could do.

205
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,310
Princess' father, he told of a prophecy.

206
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,470
The illness could only be stopped

207
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,718
if the daughter of a chief
gave up her life for her people.

After a long debate, they knew
they couldn't ask for such a sacrifice.

209
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:20,913
And the princess, when she heard
about this prophecy,

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,789
she knew what she had to do,
'cause she loved her people so much.

211
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,840
One morning,
she climbed up to those rocks.

And without hesitation, she jumped.

But the chief knew

sacrifice to be remembered.

The real underlying flaw in your life

And then you would trust me.

Trust you? Why would I do that?

829

My daughter is dead.

Let me ask you,

01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:04,639
how confident are you in your ability

870

Usually pretty obvious.

And your basis for something
being good is what?

And evil?

875
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:24,750
It's harmful.

876
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:28,199
If it hurts someone I care about.

877
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:31,876
So, pretty much, you are the judge?

878
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:34,280
Yeah, I guess.
