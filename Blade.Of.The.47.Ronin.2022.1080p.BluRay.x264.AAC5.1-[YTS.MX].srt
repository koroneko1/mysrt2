1
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,521
Lord Arai.

2
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:11,614
- Lord Arai.
- Lord Arai.

3
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:19,914
Lord Arai.

4
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:28,673
Lord Arai.

5
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,927
Lord Arai.

6
00:01:47,275 --> 00:01:48,693
Lord Arai.

7
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:50,194
Right this way.

8
00:02:13,259 --> 00:02:14,635
You're early.

9
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:15,970
You're on time.

10
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,306
Very samurai of you.

11
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,891
Welcome to the House of Arai.

12
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,686
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

13
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,564
I've never been in the presence
of a witch before.

14
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,566
I figured it was urgent,

15
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,653
since we are breaking
a 300-year-old protocol.

16
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:37,366
But I must say, I never expected
the House of Arai to be here,

17
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,993
so far from home.

18
00:02:39,076 --> 00:02:40,494
Well, despite its appearances,

19
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:42,663
Budapest is the crossroads
of East and West.

20
00:02:42,747 --> 00:02:44,457
Setting up here is--

21
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,958
Unnecessary?

22
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:51,672
Well, times have changed, Hirano.

23
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:55,009
We have both adapted to survive.

24
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:00,598
Sake?

25
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:12,610
Sake.

26
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,116
To trust.

27
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:29,377
So, what is this pressing matter?

28
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:37,093
Yurei is here,
and he intends to destroy all samurai.

29
00:03:37,176 --> 00:03:38,177
But it can't be.

30
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:42,264
And I fear betrayal from one of our own.

31
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:44,350
We need your help, Hirano.

32
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,727
-With what?
-The Tengu Sword.

33
00:03:47,812 --> 00:03:48,896
What?

34
00:03:49,522 --> 00:03:51,315
The Tengu Sword was split,

35
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:54,610
so neither samurai nor witch
could abuse its power.

36
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:55,903
We have to unite them again.

37
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:58,531
And Yurei knows that
if we unite the sword,

38
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,241
it's the only thing that can stop him.

39
00:04:01,075 --> 00:04:04,829
If that were true,
then he'll come after us.

40
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:07,665
And even more reason
we should never be in the same place.

41
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,584
Uniting the sword is not the answer.

42
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,003
If you can't protect your Warrior Blade,

43
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:15,923
then pass it on to another descendant.

44
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,426
What you suggested is no longer an option.

45
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:20,636
Yurei has killed all the others.

46
00:04:22,388 --> 00:04:25,641
I am the last descendant of the 47 Ronin.

47
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,189
Suppose I believe you.

48
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,151
Are you saying
if I give you the Witch Blade,

49
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,027
you intend to fulfill the prophecy?

50
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:43,451
We can unite the blade,
and we can fulfill it.

51
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,703
Together.

52
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,121
Trust, Hirano.

53
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,292
The future of our two people
can begin in this room

54
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:52,918
if we work together.

55
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,550
How good is your magic?

56
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,930
How good is your sword?

57
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,516
Let's find out.

58
00:06:58,586 --> 00:06:59,712
Yurei.

59
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,706
Sorry about your friend.

60
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:05,611
The last descendant.

61
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:09,114
It must be hard carrying all that weight.

62
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:14,495
Your whole life predetermined
just because of your blood.

63
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:16,705
Go fuck yourself.

64
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,386
I still feel it.

65
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,847
There's another.

66
00:09:54,762 --> 00:09:56,221
-Ooh!

67
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,974
Sorry. Annoying tourist. Sorry.

68
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:01,852
Oh.

69
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,646
Of course his name is Richard.

70
00:11:04,623 --> 00:11:07,543
Oh, look. It's the geishas.
Anyone need a coffee run?

71
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:08,794
Onami.

72
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,339
Oh, uh-- Lord Nikko.

73
00:11:45,956 --> 00:11:46,957
Lord Okoro.

74
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,334
Lord Maeda.

75
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:51,795
Lord Shinshiro.

76
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:53,589
Lord Nikko.

77
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,218
As you all know,
the House of Arai has fallen.

78
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:02,180
Lord Arai was a brother to us all.

79
00:12:02,264 --> 00:12:06,602
We must investigate what happened
and figure out our next moves.

80
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:08,687
What's there to investigate?

81
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,230
Arai is dead.

82
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:13,108
Yurei and Hirano are of the same blood.

83
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,738
Arai made a big mistake trusting a witch.

84
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,283
Unless Hirano was betrayed as well.

85
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:24,202
Why would Yurei kill one of his own?

86
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:29,750
Maybe Hirano refused to give up
the Witch Blade.

87
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:33,253
Whatever happened between Arai and Hirano,

88
00:12:33,337 --> 00:12:36,048
we still have to contend with
the prophecy.

89
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:41,511
The Blade of the 47 Ronin,
fortified by magic and valor,

90
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:46,642
will be wielded by a true descendant
to defeat an evil borne from the past.

91
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:49,436
Arai was the last descendant.

92
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,523
He died, and the prophecy died with him.

93
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:57,152
The Record Keeper has seen another
who can fulfill it.

94
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,780
Lord Ikeda, are you still seeking counsel

95
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:03,367
from flimsy fortune tellers
and charlatans?

96
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,451
Come on.

97
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,079
Some of us respect our sacred traditions.

98
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,416
The Keeper had a vision
of another descendant.

99
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:17,547
A young American woman
here to collect her inheritance.

100
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:22,511
He saw the Warrior Blade in her hands.

101
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:28,725
You put your faith
in an outsider, Lord Shinshiro?

102
00:13:28,809 --> 00:13:30,978
Oh, and a woman, no less.

103
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:34,231
Samurai blood is strong.

104
00:13:34,314 --> 00:13:39,361
But sharing blood doesn't mean
she's bound to our cause.

105
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:43,323
We need to convince her
to honor Lord Arai's legacy.

106
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:47,995
"Honor."

107
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:52,207
I lost a good friend, Lord Shinshiro.

108
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,668
A brother, huh?

109
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:59,297
So you talk about honor. Uh-uh.
I am here to avenge him!

110
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,383
Avenge.

111
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:07,597
So, while you were busy, uh,
reading scrolls...

112
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:11,768
...my clan invested in modern weaponry, hmm?

113
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,730
We can protect ourselves

114
00:14:14,813 --> 00:14:17,190
by finding and destroying the blade.

115
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:19,234
But we have sworn to protect it.

116
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:22,904
Keep your strays in line, Lord Shinshiro.

117
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,073
My apologies.

118
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:34,583
But if brute force were the solution,

119
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:39,546
we would not have devoted lifetimes
to the prophecy.

120
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,340
Guns do not defeat magic.

121
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,886
Let us take this evening
to think about it.

122
00:14:47,054 --> 00:14:49,056
We can put it to a vote tomorrow.

123
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:55,854
Well, I hope you all will
come around by then.

124
00:15:03,737 --> 00:15:05,781
Three, two, one, go!

125
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:14,706
-Whose face are you picturing?
-No one's.

126
00:15:16,917 --> 00:15:18,585
Fucking Nikko
and his cock sucking bully.

127
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,921
Oh, so that's why you are so distracted.

128
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,425
I'm not distracted.

129
00:15:28,303 --> 00:15:30,514
Look, here's a delicate situation.

130
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:32,641
Oh, a delicate situation?
Yeah, let's blow this shit up!

131
00:15:34,518 --> 00:15:36,103
Onami, that's not the answer.

132
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:38,313
I'm just gonna find
the last descendant myself.

133
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,273
-Oh, no. She's plotting.
-She'd better not,

134
00:15:40,357 --> 00:15:42,317
'cause Lord Nikko
wants her to stay out of it.

135
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,321
Yes, as geisha,
we give the men what they want.

136
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:49,366
We're onna-bugeisha.
Anything men can kill, we can kill better.

137
00:15:52,744 --> 00:15:55,288
Stop provoking her,
or she'll end up like Reo.

138
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,836
Reo was protecting me. He was set up.

139
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:06,424
Maybe, but he's a Ronin now.

140
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,096
Oh, my gosh. Mai.

141
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:16,351
He can help me track down the descendant.

142
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:19,563
You think Reo would still help
even after being kicked out?

143
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,940
Yeah. Reo's a great tracker,
and he wants back in.

144
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:24,234
Oh, yeah. He would do anything for you.

145
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,572
I tagged our prophecy girl.

146
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,368
Tracking strangers seems highly illegal.

147
00:17:15,452 --> 00:17:18,246
She didn't feel me tag her,
so it's not my problem.

148
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,791
Besides, we're in
the criminal crossroads of the world.

149
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,169
Budapest once had
a bad reputation for smuggling,

150
00:17:24,252 --> 00:17:26,546
-but certain clans have histori--
-Spare me the history lesson.

151
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:28,215
God, you were never any fun.

152
00:17:28,298 --> 00:17:29,382
You never listen.

153
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,634
-Know-it-all.
-Deviant.

154
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:32,010
-Teacher's pet.
-Flake.

155
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,387
Are you out past your curfew?

156
00:17:35,931 --> 00:17:37,015
Come here.

157
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:40,393
Admit it. You missed me, didn't you?

158
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:41,811
Shut up.

159
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,149
Look at you, all grown up and shit.

160
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,987
-How'd you find her?
-Oh, straight to business then?

161
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,532
No "Hi, Reo. It's good to see you!
I missed you! I'm so glad you're alive"?

162
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,326
Geez.

163
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:59,079
These boring-ass samurai
have been clearly rubbing off on you.

164
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,413
You mock them,

165
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,583
and yet you secretly follow them
to their emergency summit?

166
00:18:03,667 --> 00:18:05,377
Listen, I'm just looking out for you.

167
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,837
And the old man.

168
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:10,757
How is Shinshiro?

169
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,218
He misses you.

170
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:14,427
Yeah, right.

171
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:18,848
Luckily for you, I come bearing intel.

172
00:18:18,932 --> 00:18:19,933
Hey, Rachel.

173
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,019
One Reo Special
and whatever she's having.

174
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,813
I'm not here to drink.

175
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:27,232
Make that two.

176
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:28,984
- Sure thing.
-So, listen,

177
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:31,403
me and the Record Keeper, we're like this.

178
00:18:31,945 --> 00:18:35,573
Well, we've never really met in person,
but other than that, like this.

179
00:18:35,657 --> 00:18:38,285
So I asked him about this prophecy girl.

180
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:41,246
Turns out she's got
quite the background check.

181
00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:43,748
We should probably engage
before she gets thrown in jail.

182
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,543
Our prophecy rests in the hands
of a criminal?

183
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,212
Hey, now, let's give her a chance.
Former criminal.

184
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:52,716
Who's been trying to hock
some shady goods in a hurry.

185
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,176
She wants to sell
an ancient legacy for a quick buck?

186
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,721
Hey, student debt gives no fucks.

187
00:18:58,555 --> 00:18:59,639
Why here?

188
00:18:59,723 --> 00:19:02,100
Do you know how much
these people will pay for collectibles?

189
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,186
Look, the Record Keeper hacked
her emails and found a deal she made

190
00:19:05,270 --> 00:19:08,773
for an online buyer
looking for an ancient samurai artifact.

191
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:09,983
As a matter of fact...

192
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:14,112
deal's going down right now.

193
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:17,490
Nero on Fire?

194
00:19:23,747 --> 00:19:24,998
Is that shit stolen?

195
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,250
You don't even know me like that.

196
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,502
This is actually the one thing
I legally acquired.

197
00:19:33,673 --> 00:19:34,883
I'll come back later.

198
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,010
Dude! What the fuck?

199
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,428
Oh, shit. She's on the move.

200
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:43,892
Let's cut her off.

201
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:02,660
Oh, fuck!

202
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,703
Stop running!

203
00:21:17,068 --> 00:21:18,611
-You need to listen.
- Onami.

204
00:21:19,529 --> 00:21:20,738
Uncle.

205
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,243
So oddly muscular.

206
00:21:25,326 --> 00:21:26,327
Reo?

207
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:29,122
Lord Shinshiro.

208
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,754
Of all my apprentices, I chose only
the onna-bugeisha to join this trip.

209
00:21:36,838 --> 00:21:41,134
To follow and observe this mission,
not recklessly lead your own.

210
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:44,637
But I found her--
the last descendant of the 47.

211
00:21:46,055 --> 00:21:49,017
That was never your responsibility.
You should have come to me.

212
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,978
Or have I lost your trust?

213
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:54,397
I'm sorry.

214
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:56,900
Yo, does anyone wanna tell me
what the fuck is going on?

215
00:21:56,983 --> 00:21:59,235
-Language.
-I tried to explain. You wouldn't listen.

216
00:21:59,319 --> 00:22:02,947
Yeah, I typically don't stop and listen to
people chasing me with swords, asshole.

217
00:22:03,031 --> 00:22:04,908
-Language!
-You're just mad I had you.

218
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:07,702
Keep telling yourself that,
knockoff Hermione Granger.

219
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,704
-We were trying to save your life.
-"We"?

220
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:17,462
Who the hell are these freaks anyway?

221
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:24,511
These freaks were sent to stop you
from fulfilling an ancient prophecy.

222
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:28,181
Look, I don't know what kind of con
you guys are running. Respect, but pass.

223
00:22:33,269 --> 00:22:34,687
I am Lord Shinshiro.

224
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,523
May I ask your name?

225
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,234
Oh, uh--

226
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:42,320
Sorry that I didn't introduce myself,
Lord Shinshiro.

227
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,322
Um, I am Lord Go Fuck Yourself.

228
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,076
Her name's Luna.

229
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,332
Luna.

230
00:22:54,958 --> 00:22:57,001
Did you collect your father's sword?

231
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,006
Why? What's it worth to you guys?

232
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:05,385
Your father was samurai.

233
00:23:05,969 --> 00:23:07,303
One of the best.

234
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:09,889
A man with a great destiny.

235
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:13,893
Charming story about the guy
who knocked up my mom and ditched us.

236
00:23:13,977 --> 00:23:16,020
Do you guys wanna bid
on the blade or what?

237
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:18,439
That blade is worth more
than money could buy.

238
00:23:18,523 --> 00:23:20,942
Wow. Okay. Price just went up.

239
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:24,487
Luna, there is a lot about your family
that you need to know.

240
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:27,156
But not here.
We can talk at the safe house.

241
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:31,578
I'm definitely not following you
to a second location, dude.

242
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:35,206
Luna, you need protection.
You cannot be on your own.

243
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:37,083
Well, I've been on my own for years,

244
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:39,836
so I don't think I need the protection
of a John Wick fanboy.

245
00:23:46,426 --> 00:23:49,220
-We should go.
-What the fuck?

246
00:23:49,304 --> 00:23:50,888
Language.

247
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:54,642
You--

248
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:55,935
Just-- Just come with me.

249
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:58,521
We're just gonna leave
a beheaded dude on the ground?

250
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,588
I am sorry.

251
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:11,010
For what?

252
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:14,514
You had to do what you had to do.

253
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,899
Maybe I needed to learn the hard way
how to keep my temper in check.

254
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:31,614
Lord Nikko's pupil baited you,
and now he picks on Onami.

255
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:35,368
Small men pick on easy targets.

256
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:40,206
Small men pick on those
who do not yet know their own power.

257
00:25:41,165 --> 00:25:44,168
They hope to snuff out your light
before it outshines them.

258
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:55,263
I will not let that same mistake
happen twice.

259
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:04,522
What the hell is this place?

260
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,190
It's a samurai safe house.

261
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:10,194
Each family has their own
underground network across the world.

262
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:12,071
Wow. Fancy.

263
00:26:13,364 --> 00:26:17,243
Has this place got a bathroom,
or should I just go piss in a corner?

264
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,787
Follow me.

265
00:26:19,871 --> 00:26:22,457
What are you, my PO?
Just tell me where it is.

266
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:26,127
What, you think ninja are gonna
ambush me in the bathroom?

267
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,715
Have you been ambushed
by a ninja in the bathroom?

268
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,066
Jesus!

269
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:52,236
-Ninja are patient, relentless.

270
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,615
In ancient times, they'd infiltrate
entire families for decades

271
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:57,825
just to strike when least expected.

272
00:26:57,909 --> 00:27:00,119
Okay, well,
thank you for the history lesson.

273
00:27:00,703 --> 00:27:03,664
I'm just making sure you stay alive
to fulfill the prophecy.

274
00:27:03,748 --> 00:27:06,083
Oh, I haven't agreed to anything yet.

275
00:27:07,001 --> 00:27:10,630
You know, your legacy is a privilege
some of us would Kill for,

276
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,799
and you're treating it like shit.

277
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:15,343
If you want this blade so bad,
just buy it from me.

278
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:18,513
Buy it? We need you to wield it.

279
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,182
First, we have to make it to the vote.

280
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:24,811
Hurry up. It'll be daybreak soon.

281
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,981
-You got something right there.
-Aw, thanks, princess.

282
00:27:55,258 --> 00:27:56,551
Isn't that Lord Okoro?

283
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,302
It appears to be lockdown protocol.

284
00:27:58,386 --> 00:28:00,930
Do you think they would attack
a hotel full of samurai?

285
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,056
Who's "they"?

286
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,226
-They probably discovered our location.
-Who the fuck is "they"?

287
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:06,769
-Ninja!
-Language!

288
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:10,773
You know what? Screw this.

289
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:14,110
You gotta be kidding me.

290
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:17,321
Thank you for meeting me early.

291
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:25,454
What's on your mind?

292
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:30,543
I'm concerned with your perspective
on the future of the samurai.

293
00:28:33,212 --> 00:28:35,464
You asked to meet early to tell me that?

294
00:28:36,048 --> 00:28:37,758
-I think we should--
-Ikeda.

295
00:28:37,842 --> 00:28:42,054
However the vote goes, I trust it will be
for the greater good of all samurai.

296
00:28:45,892 --> 00:28:47,643
You can't just go off on your own.

297
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:50,271
You said I'd be safer with your crew,
and clearly I'm not.

298
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:52,356
-Come with us.
-No. I'm out.

299
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,649
Getting a cab to the airport.

300
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,651
There's no place that's safe
while you have the blade.

301
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:57,737
-Are you always this dramatic?
-We're trying to save--

302
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:01,324
Holy shit.

303
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,791
We need to get you to safety.

304
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,710
Please, just listen to me.

305
00:30:12,687 --> 00:30:14,271
Protect her at all costs.

306
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50,266
Who are you?

307
00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:28,596
-Luna! Let's go!

308
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,601
Think you broke it, dude.

309
00:31:34,185 --> 00:31:35,561
Whoo!

310
00:31:54,455 --> 00:31:55,456
Ikeda?

311
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:43,295
Keeper is here?

312
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:44,672
Are you sure?

313
00:32:44,755 --> 00:32:47,550
No, I just love
creepy abandoned warehouses.

314
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:50,886
Relax. The clans rented this space
while they're in town.

315
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:56,392
What the fu-- frick is a Keeper?

316
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:59,436
The Record Keepers are an ancient group
of samurai prophets.

317
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,233
They preserve the records of history
and see glimpses of the future.

318
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:08,904
Oh, okay. But this one's home base
is just where high-school kids score weed.

319
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,991
We should head to a safe house.

320
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:15,119
We will, but we need some answers first.

321
00:33:16,078 --> 00:33:17,079
Be aware.

322
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:19,623
-Remember?
-I remember her, yeah.

323
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:21,625
-Dude, uh, yeah. Crazy.

324
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:36,056
Excuse me. Sorry to interrupt
your energy drink commercial,

325
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:38,225
but we're looking for a guy named Dash.

326
00:33:39,018 --> 00:33:41,353
-Whoa, Jesus!
-You must be the bodyguard.

327
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:48,152
We're looking for the Keeper.

328
00:33:49,069 --> 00:33:50,529
My apologies, Lord Shinshiro.

329
00:33:52,448 --> 00:33:53,616

00:35:46,103 --> 00:35:48,564
You must be Prophecy Girl.

363
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,901
Yeah, yeah. I would love if--
if you could tell me what that means.

364
00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:57,323
The Blade of the 47 Ronin,
fortified by magic and valor,

365
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:01,994
will be wielded by a true descendant
to defeat an evil borne from the past.

366
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,872
Am I supposed to know
what any of that means?

367
00:36:04,955 --> 00:36:08,375
You see,
prophecies are kinda tricky to interpret.

368
00:36:08,459 --> 00:36:11,211
For instance, the valor part.

369
00:36:12,171 --> 00:36:15,883
The Tengu Sword is the Witch Blade
and the Warrior Blade fused together.

370
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,218
You have the Warrior Blade.

371
00:36:18,302 --> 00:36:20,429
We're searching for the Witch Blade.

372
00:36:21,472 --> 00:36:22,473
Okay.

373
00:36:22,556 --> 00:36:23,599
And the--

374
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,352
The "evil borne from the past" part,
is that Onami?

375
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:28,854
That's Yurei.

376
00:36:28,937 --> 00:36:30,481
He's the descendant of Mizuki.

377
00:36:31,315 --> 00:36:33,692
She was the witch slain by Kai.

378
00:36:33,776 --> 00:36:36,111
One of the original 47 Ronin.

379
00:36:36,195 --> 00:36:40,949
And you, Luna,
are the last descendant of the 47

380
00:36:41,033 --> 00:36:43,452
and the only one who can kill Yurei.

381
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:47,581
Okay, let's just pretend for a second
that I believe any of this.

382
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:50,584
How do you guys know
that you have the right person, right?

383
00:36:50,667 --> 00:36:54,129
This sounds pretty important.
How do you know I am the last descendant?

384
00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:55,714
Because I've seen it.

385
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:12,439
Uh--

386
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:15,150
Dude, are you okay? Are you--

387
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:20,364
On the next blood moon,
Yurei will unite the two blades,

388
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,242
which will unleash
the full power of his magic.

389
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:29,957
He won't stop until the bloodline
of the 47 Ronin is extinguished

390
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,626
and all samurai are destroyed.

391
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,298
-Here.

392
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:43,929
O-Okay, what-- what if we melt it down?
Right? Then nobody can get to it.

393
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:46,890
That is impossible.
Only magic can reshape it.

394
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,434
Which gives us two choices.

395
00:37:48,517 --> 00:37:51,603
Either you fulfill the prophecy
and kill Yurei with the united blades or--

396
00:37:51,687 --> 00:37:53,939
Or he kills me. Yeah.

397
00:37:54,022 --> 00:37:58,193
And then nothing will stop him
from wiping out all samurai.

398
00:38:01,905 --> 00:38:02,906
Okay.

399
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:07,619
So if I understand correctly,
we just have to find this Witch Blade,

400
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,329
unite it with the one I have,

401
00:38:09,413 --> 00:38:12,666
and murder this Yurei guy
before the next blood moon.

402
00:38:13,625 --> 00:38:15,461
-When is that?
-Five days.

403
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,132
From-- From now?

404
00:38:22,885 --> 00:38:24,970
My flight leaves in two, so...

405
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,314
-Oh, I'm starving.
-Mmm.

406
00:38:48,285 --> 00:38:51,121
I'm not able to get in touch
with any of the other lords.

407
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:55,792
All their trackers are offline.

408
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:57,544
Except for yours.

409
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:03,258
You put a tracker on me?

410
00:39:03,342 --> 00:39:05,677
-Thought it'd be a good idea--
-You didn't ask!

411
00:39:08,847 --> 00:39:10,766
Where is it? Take--

412
00:39:20,859 --> 00:39:22,402
Maybe that's a good thing.

413
00:39:29,451 --> 00:39:30,869
You did good, Reo.

414
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:39,211
Thank you.

415
00:39:45,092 --> 00:39:48,804
Nikko's tracker went down at the hotel,
right as the attack went down.

416
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:50,556
Maybe he didn't make it out.

417
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:53,976
Do you think the ninja got them all?

418
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:57,020
Hopefully it's just that
their safe houses block my tracker.

419
00:39:57,646 --> 00:40:00,524
We should stay here
and call for reinforcements.

420
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,569
We cannot leave
the prime houses unprotected.

421
00:40:04,361 --> 00:40:06,029
What if that's what Yurei wants?

422
00:40:08,532 --> 00:40:12,619
Lure us to our safe house,
so he can strike us all down like Arai?

423
00:40:14,997 --> 00:40:16,748
I'll search for the lords myself.

424
00:40:18,709 --> 00:40:21,962
Then they will help us
hunt for the Witch Blade.

425
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,797
We should stay together.

426
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,341
-Take the fight to Yurei.
-She's not ready for the fight yet.

427
00:40:31,305 --> 00:40:34,308
Do you think she will learn
how to swing a sword in five days?

428
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:35,392
Yes.

429
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,730
She will learn
because she will have a great master.

430
00:40:43,942 --> 00:40:44,943
You.

431
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,112
Me?

432
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:50,699
No way. I'm just an apprentice.

433
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:51,783
Not anymore.

434
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:55,287
You have been leading this mission
the whole time.

435
00:40:56,121 --> 00:40:58,123
Now it is official.

436
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,504
And you will help train Luna as well.

437
00:41:06,757 --> 00:41:09,384
So, you're leaving me in charge?

438
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:11,887
I'll be back as soon as I can.

439
00:41:12,638 --> 00:41:15,307
-But it's too dangerous to go alone.
- I'll be fine.

440
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,100
I'll clear the safe houses.

441
00:41:17,184 --> 00:41:19,561
You can use them, but don't stay too long.

442
00:41:19,645 --> 00:41:21,688
Keep the Warrior Blade on the move.

443
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:26,234
So if you're putting me in charge,
then I say you take bodyguards.

444
00:41:29,279 --> 00:41:30,614
One bodyguard.

445
00:41:31,365 --> 00:41:33,408
Fine. Mai?

446
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,327
Let's do it.

447
00:41:51,802 --> 00:41:52,636
Uncle!

448
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:59,267
Be careful.

449
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:16,868
You too.

450
00:42:43,228 --> 00:42:46,273
If I do well in training,
do I have to dress like Onami?

451
00:42:46,356 --> 00:42:48,066
Don't worry. You'll never do that well.

452
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:55,574
-What, you don't know the code?
-He must have changed it.

453
00:42:55,657 --> 00:42:57,409
How the hell are we supposed to get in?

454
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,536
All right.
Looks like we go analog on this one.

455
00:42:59,619 --> 00:43:03,039
-We are not breaking in.
-You got a better idea, Cho Chang?

456
00:43:03,123 --> 00:43:06,543
We don't have time for this shit.
Just let her do her thing.

457
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,921
Fine.

458
00:43:23,894 --> 00:43:24,895
Nice.

459
00:43:25,896 --> 00:43:26,897
You're welcome.

460
00:43:27,606 --> 00:43:31,193
Before you can strike,
you must be able to listen.

461
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:33,862
Ninja live in the darkness.

462
00:43:33,945 --> 00:43:35,447
-They thrive in it.

463
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:39,618
They will strike from the shadows,
so you must learn to hear them coming.

464
00:43:40,786 --> 00:43:43,705
By the time you see them,
it will already be too late.

465
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:49,920
All right. Your turn.

466
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,090
Just stick with the stabs.

467
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:55,175
Very simple, ladies.

468
00:43:55,258 --> 00:43:57,385
First one to hand it to me wins.

469
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,721
Three, two, one, go.

470
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,100
Take a deep breath.

471
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,186
-What do you hear?

472
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:08,188
Dude, I hear five o'clock traffic.

473
00:44:08,772 --> 00:44:10,649
-Are you listening?
-I am trying.

474
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:14,903
You must hear through the noise
and listen to what is really important.

475
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,906
-I just hear angry Hungarian people.

476
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,866
How are you the answer to our problems?

477
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:27,082
-Are you listening?

478
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:29,209
Dude, that blew out my eardrum.

479
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:31,545
My arms tensed, reared back and swung.

480
00:44:31,628 --> 00:44:33,630
Plenty of warning
if you were truly listening.

481
00:44:35,799 --> 00:44:36,800
Not bad.

482
00:44:39,511 --> 00:44:40,512
Damn.

483
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,931
That samurai blood is no joke.

484
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:44,891
Pretty sure it's the New Yorker side.

485
00:44:45,433 --> 00:44:47,185
-What the hell?
-Heard that one?

486
00:44:47,269 --> 00:44:50,021
Yeah, I heard her sword
go straight for my trachea.

487
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,025
You heard the blade cut through the air.

488
00:44:54,109 --> 00:44:56,027
But did you hear the scabbard shift?

489
00:44:56,611 --> 00:44:58,113
The sword slide?

490
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:02,200
What's it like, anyway?
Being a real samurai?

491
00:45:02,993 --> 00:45:05,203
-I'm actually a Ronin.
-What's that?

492
00:45:05,287 --> 00:45:08,707
A master less samurai. It's what happens
when you break one rule too many.

493
00:45:09,666 --> 00:45:11,668
Three, two, one, go.

494
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:18,300
Oh.

495
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:23,013
Guess we can't all be
prim and proper Japanese princesses, huh?

496
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:24,973
Onami's more like us than you think.

497
00:45:26,057 --> 00:45:29,394
Shinshiro found her as a baby
and he raised her as if she was his own,

498
00:45:29,477 --> 00:45:31,229
but nobody knows her ancestry,

499
00:45:31,313 --> 00:45:35,609
so no matter how hard she tries,
the clans will never acknowledge her.

500
00:45:40,238 --> 00:45:42,574
Three. Four.

501
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:44,951
Five.

502
00:45:45,952 --> 00:45:46,953
Six.

503
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:19,945
Two.

504
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:25,742
Three.

505
00:46:27,744 --> 00:46:28,745
Four.

506
00:46:44,427 --> 00:46:48,181
So, when are you gonna show me that cool
spin kick you did at the cosplay party?

507
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:51,184
-You don't need to know that. Focus.
-Come on.

508
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:55,271
There are no points for fancy shit
in a real battle.

509
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,732
Oh. Okay, so you admit it.
You think it's fancy.

510
00:47:02,570 --> 00:47:05,448
Man, being a samurai
is a lot of repetitive drills.

511
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,910
Actually, the term "samurai"
is used only for men.

512
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,286
We're onna-bugeisha.

513
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:11,538
What?

514
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,582
But you train like samurai,
and you live like samurai.

515
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,252
Tell me about it.

516
00:47:19,462 --> 00:47:20,463
Hmm.

517
00:47:43,153 --> 00:47:44,320
Thanks.

518
00:47:44,404 --> 00:47:45,780
You have beautiful eyes.

519
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:03,590
Damn, dude. Can you be any louder?

520
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:05,300
I should actually be even louder.

521
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,553
Haven't you seen
that '80s ramen Western, Tampopo?

522
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,097
-No.
-What? It's a classic.

523
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:16,311
Slurping is a sign of respect,
and ramen is real-life art.

524
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,896
Mmm.

525
00:48:17,979 --> 00:48:20,023
Smell the broth.

526
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,149
Mmm.

527
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:24,277
Notice that seaweed
just perfectly laying on top there?

528
00:48:25,445 --> 00:48:26,738
Now, the chicken--

529
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:30,909
Before I eat it, I massage it,

530
00:48:31,785 --> 00:48:33,078
I acknowledge it,

531
00:48:33,828 --> 00:48:34,954
I thank it,

532
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,332
and I apologize to it.

533
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:43,004
-I'm sorry, chicken.
-That's why I'm a vegetarian, dude.

534
00:48:43,088 --> 00:48:45,215
Aya says Dash has a lead
on the Witch Blade.

535
00:48:45,298 --> 00:48:46,841
We should start heading back soon.

536
00:48:47,634 --> 00:48:48,927
-You mean now?
-Yeah, now.

537
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,304
-But I just started.
-Oh, my gosh. Come on.

538
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,056
-Fine.
-Let's go. Nope. Let's go.

539
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:02,398
Oh, shit.

540
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:04,901
I gotta order a burger.

541
00:49:04,984 --> 00:49:06,986
Are you fucking serious?
We don't have time.

542
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,364
- Luna.
-There's no line. I'll get it to go.

543
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:15,286
What is it?

544
00:49:16,454 --> 00:49:19,374
I don't know. I think--
I think someone's following us.

545
00:49:19,457 --> 00:49:21,209
Where? I don't see anybody.

546
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:29,050
He was just there.

547
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:32,178
Told you it was a bad idea to come here.

548
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:34,305
Will you quit being paranoid?
Nobody's following us.

549
00:49:34,389 --> 00:49:35,890
We shouldn't have listened to you.

550
00:49:35,974 --> 00:49:37,684
-We gotta get outta here. Now.
-Let's go.

551
00:49:42,063 --> 00:49:44,858
Sorry.
I thought I was gonna have it that time.

552
00:49:45,775 --> 00:49:49,696
Maybe I can't see the Witch Blade
because of its protective spell.

553
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:50,780
Mmm.

554
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:55,785
Good news is, if I can't find it,
Yurei probably can't either.

555
00:49:57,453 --> 00:50:00,206
-I think we're being followed.
-We went to the food market.

556
00:50:00,832 --> 00:50:04,002
How could you be so irresponsible?
You are supposed to be in charge.

557
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,754
-It was my idea. Blame me.
-Sorry, we don't have time for this.

558
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,299
Do you really think
our location is compromised?

559
00:50:09,382 --> 00:50:11,759
We can't wait to find out.
Do you have a backup hideout?

560
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:14,137
House of Arai set up hideouts
all over the city.

561
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,264
Perfect. It's not like
they're using them anymore.

562
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:21,895
Too soon.

563
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,022
I see that now.

564
00:50:25,773 --> 00:50:27,525
May they rest in peace.

565
00:50:35,033 --> 00:50:36,784
Dash and Luna, hang back with me.

566
00:50:44,292 --> 00:50:45,293
Clear!

567
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:51,507
Clear.

568
00:50:55,428 --> 00:50:56,429
Clear.

569
00:50:58,806 --> 00:50:59,807
Clear.

570
00:51:01,851 --> 00:51:04,520
I'm trying to update Lord Shinshiro
on our movement,

571
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:06,189
but he isn't answering.

572
00:51:06,272 --> 00:51:07,815
I'll check the tracker.

573
00:51:07,899 --> 00:51:10,610
Hey, Luna, can I ask you a favor?

574
00:51:10,693 --> 00:51:11,819
Sure.

575
00:51:18,952 --> 00:51:21,579
While the action figures are busy, I...

576
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:26,668
could use your help.

577
00:51:29,212 --> 00:51:32,215
I've uncovered some history
on the Witch Blade's protectors,

578
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,885
but nothing's triggering a vision
about where it could be hidden now.

579
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:37,220
Mmm.

580
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:41,516
Since your father was
the Warrior Blade's protector,

581
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:47,897
I thought maybe something in your family
history might jump out as a connection.

582
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:51,067
Dude, I don't know shit about my dad.

583
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:59,742
I could always just study
your Warrior Blade for a couple hours.

584
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:01,995
Uh...

585
00:52:03,871 --> 00:52:05,999
Yeah, I-- I don't know.

586
00:52:06,082 --> 00:52:07,083
Okay, never mind.

587
00:52:07,166 --> 00:52:09,377
Um-- Do you mind?

588
00:52:13,506 --> 00:52:16,134
It should cover your family tree.

589
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:19,304
Arrest records, news clippings,

590
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:21,472
birth certificate.

591
00:52:23,182 --> 00:52:25,184
Let me know if something clicks for you.

592
00:52:30,023 --> 00:52:31,733
Well, this is my mom.

593
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:34,777
She had a beautiful name.

594
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:37,363
Yeah.

595
00:52:38,156 --> 00:52:39,157
Nita.

596
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,496
You know,
I used to have this photo of her.

597
00:52:46,789 --> 00:52:49,000
But after she died, I kinda just...

598
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,295
left everything behind.

599
00:53:00,136 --> 00:53:01,387
You can keep that tablet.

600
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:06,642
Are you sure? This is, like, 1200 bucks.

601
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:10,688
Thanks.

602
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:19,489
Okay, I'll let you borrow it
for a few hours.

603
00:53:22,825 --> 00:53:24,952
It's the least I can do for $1,200.

604
00:53:25,787 --> 00:53:27,372
I'm gonna need it back.

605
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:30,750
Okay.

606
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:43,888
Fuck! Nikko, Ikeda, Maeda, Okoro.

607
00:53:43,971 --> 00:53:47,392
Now Lord Shinshiro?
How are they all still radio silent?

608
00:53:47,475 --> 00:53:49,894
-Do you think Yurei--
-Shinshiro is fine.

609
00:53:49,977 --> 00:53:52,605
They are on a search-and-rescue mission.

610
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:54,941
They are probably staying off the grid
on purpose.

611
00:53:55,024 --> 00:53:56,275
It's not like him, and you know it.

612
00:53:56,984 --> 00:53:58,361
Did you get a hold of Shinshiro?

613
00:53:59,654 --> 00:54:01,739
His tracker's down.

614
00:54:02,532 --> 00:54:04,742
-How long have you been trying him?

615
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:07,370
A few hours.

616
00:54:07,453 --> 00:54:09,163
Hours? We need to find him.

617
00:54:09,247 --> 00:54:12,083
I can check around the city tonight
if that helps.

618
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:15,086
-Hit up a few of my contacts.
-No. I'm gonna look for him now.

619
00:54:17,422 --> 00:54:18,423
Okay.

620
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:20,174
Where are we going?

621
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:24,303
I'll-- I'll retrace his steps.
He was headed towards--

622
00:54:24,387 --> 00:54:27,348
Someone was following you,
and you wanna go back out there?

623
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:30,393
-Shinshiro is missing.
-Your mission is to protect Luna.

624
00:54:31,477 --> 00:54:33,062
Family comes first.

625
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:37,817
Don't worry.

626
00:54:38,317 --> 00:54:39,527
Everything is--

627
00:54:47,618 --> 00:54:50,455
Okay, Witch Blade, where are you?

628
00:55:09,223 --> 00:55:10,766
You have the Warrior Blade.

629
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:12,310
I told you you are not samurai.

630
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:14,103
We're searching for the Witch Blade.

631
00:55:14,187 --> 00:55:16,731
You're a witch, like me.

632
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:26,073
He saw me. He saw me.

633
00:55:39,504 --> 00:55:41,047
Find out anything?

634
00:55:42,089 --> 00:55:44,634
Warrior Blade. Witch Blade.

635
00:55:57,146 --> 00:55:58,231
Luna.

636
00:56:00,691 --> 00:56:02,193
I know you can hear me.

637
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:05,279
Come to me...

638
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:13,621
You've turned your back
on your real family.

639
00:56:13,704 --> 00:56:16,207
Your entire lineage were witches.

640
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:19,835
Your mother and the one
she fell in love with, Hirano.

641
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:21,379
No, you're wrong.

642
00:56:22,463 --> 00:56:23,464
I'm not.

643
00:56:23,548 --> 00:56:25,341
You're not the descendant.

644
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:27,468
We are the same, Luna.

645
00:56:36,519 --> 00:56:37,520
I--

646
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:54,620
This is one of the places

647
00:56:54,704 --> 00:56:56,289
Shinshiro's tracker came
before going down.

648
00:56:56,372 --> 00:56:58,791
That crest.
This is Lord Nikko's safe house.

649
00:56:58,874 --> 00:57:00,501
How are we supposed to get in?

650
00:57:00,585 --> 00:57:03,629
I mean, Dash is supposed to be tracking us
and doing his nerd thing,

651
00:57:03,713 --> 00:57:05,506
but I don't know where he is.

652
00:57:05,590 --> 00:57:07,466
Come on, Dash. Do your nerd thing.

653
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:12,013
Okay. That fucking hurt.

654
00:57:14,557 --> 00:57:16,976
Now, where's the fucking blade?

655
00:57:17,643 --> 00:57:19,312
Where's your fucking sleeves?

656
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:29,947
-Bingo. That should do it.

657
00:57:31,657 --> 00:57:32,950
Ladies first.

658
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:39,373
Visitors?

659
00:57:39,457 --> 00:57:40,541
Gag him.

660
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:00,478
I'm just saying,

661
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:04,023
nothing good ever comes
out of a hallway this narrow.

662
00:58:12,323 --> 00:58:13,574
Do you think he's here?

663
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:16,118
I don't think anybody's here.

664
00:58:19,163 --> 00:58:20,456
At least, I hope not.

665
00:58:40,101 --> 00:58:41,268
Did you see anything?

666
00:59:04,166 --> 00:59:07,128
- Shit! There's too many of them.
- What do we do?

667
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,138
Uncle.

668
00:59:51,922 --> 00:59:53,090
Lord Shinshiro.

669
00:59:54,258 --> 00:59:55,259
Yurei?

670
00:59:55,342 --> 00:59:57,887
It appears you have someone
who belongs to me.

671
00:59:58,512 --> 00:59:59,805
Her family needs her.

672
00:59:59,889 --> 01:00:02,266
Luna is already with her family.

673
01:00:02,349 --> 01:00:06,353
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
This is the Witch Blade.

674
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:08,814
See the engraving?

675
01:00:09,607 --> 01:00:12,943
The witch depiction is closer
to the handle than the samurai one.

676
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:14,737
I just saw it in a vision.

677
01:00:15,821 --> 01:00:18,365
But why would Arai have it?

678
01:00:19,408 --> 01:00:20,743
Unless...

679
01:00:21,786 --> 01:00:23,496
Arai wasn't her father.

680
01:00:23,579 --> 01:00:24,747
Hirano was.

681
01:00:26,624 --> 01:00:32,129
Meaning Luna isn't a descendant
of the 47 Ronin.

682
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,381
She's a witch.

683
01:00:34,924 --> 01:00:38,302
Luna is not samurai blood.

684
01:00:41,138 --> 01:00:42,473
She is mine.

685
01:00:44,391 --> 01:00:47,645
You take one of mine, I take one of yours.

686
01:00:52,358 --> 01:00:53,359
Go!

687
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,899
She has to be working with Yurei.

688
01:01:33,983 --> 01:01:35,818
Maybe she doesn't know the truth.

689
01:01:35,901 --> 01:01:38,445
Or we've all been risking our lives
for a pretender.

690
01:01:39,113 --> 01:01:40,406
I gotta go eat.

691
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:08,392
Lord Nikko.

692
01:02:10,811 --> 01:02:12,688
Get me my fucking sword.

693
01:02:40,966 --> 01:02:43,469
-Are you okay?
-I have to talk with Onami.

694
01:02:43,552 --> 01:02:45,095
Tell Onami what?

695
01:02:47,056 --> 01:02:48,849
The ninja are already here.

696
01:02:50,267 --> 01:02:51,602
No.

697
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:52,603
No!

698
01:04:52,639 --> 01:04:55,768
-Uncle! I gotta get you out of here.

699
01:05:00,064 --> 01:05:01,065
No.

700
01:05:32,596 --> 01:05:34,056
Oh...

701
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,730
-Onami.

702
01:05:43,565 --> 01:05:46,860
It's... okay.

703
01:05:48,362 --> 01:05:49,863
Don't say that.

704
01:05:51,824 --> 01:05:53,909
I need you.

705
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:56,912
And they...

706
01:05:58,163 --> 01:05:59,832
need you.

707
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:07,464
You...

708
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:10,676
have always been...

709
01:06:12,052 --> 01:06:14,805
a true samurai.

710
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:19,768
Lead...

711
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,479
them.

712
01:06:31,989 --> 01:06:34,616
No!

713
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,914
-Ikeda.
-Get them to safety.

714
01:06:40,998 --> 01:06:43,250
- Onami, let's go!

715
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:44,459
No! We can't!

716
01:06:44,543 --> 01:06:46,003
-Now!
-We can't!

717
01:06:51,049 --> 01:06:52,050
Shinshiro.

718
01:06:52,551 --> 01:06:54,052
No. Let me go.

719
01:06:54,553 --> 01:06:55,554
No.

720
01:06:57,181 --> 01:06:58,182
Go! Go!

721
01:06:59,099 --> 01:07:00,267
Let them go.

722
01:07:01,435 --> 01:07:03,979
We need them to find the Warrior Blade.

723
01:07:57,824 --> 01:07:59,618
Message sent.

724
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:18,030
The other lords' houses
are still offline.

725
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:22,034
Let's hope the ninja don't find them too.

726
01:10:22,969 --> 01:10:26,014
I'm so sorry.

727
01:10:27,307 --> 01:10:29,184
I should have listened to you.

728
01:10:58,213 --> 01:10:59,589
I'll be in the car.

729
01:11:01,133 --> 01:11:02,634
Whenever you're ready.

730
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:18,900
Did you know

731
01:11:20,527 --> 01:11:21,987
this whole time?

732
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:26,116
I wasn't sure.

733
01:11:27,868 --> 01:11:30,620
But you have to understand.
My mom, she was a healer.

734
01:11:30,704 --> 01:11:32,289
She was nothing like Yurei.

735
01:11:32,998 --> 01:11:34,958
Magic is magic.

736
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,127
-Just like a witch is a witch.
-Onami.

737
01:11:37,210 --> 01:11:39,129
She doesn't fucking belong here!

738
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,342
Luna.

739
01:12:23,632 --> 01:12:24,674
Hey!

740
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:29,262
I get it.

741
01:12:31,723 --> 01:12:34,434
But anger's not gonna get you anywhere.
Trust me.

742
01:12:37,270 --> 01:12:40,315
I thought all I ever wanted
was to be a samurai.

743
01:12:40,398 --> 01:12:43,485
But I couldn't even protect my family.

744
01:12:47,364 --> 01:12:50,116
Your clan, all the samurai,

745
01:12:51,284 --> 01:12:53,370
they need you now more than ever.

746
01:12:55,455 --> 01:12:57,082
It is your time to lead.

747
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,668
Shinshiro believed that.

748
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:01,002
I believe that.

749
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,923
Now, let's go prove him right.

750
01:13:22,107 --> 01:13:24,401
Do you think there are others like Hana?

751
01:13:28,405 --> 01:13:31,533
We can't trust anybody
but the people in front of us right now.

752
01:13:32,701 --> 01:13:35,036
-What do we do now?
- The plan hasn't changed.

753
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:38,790
If Yurei reunites the Tengu Sword,
he'll become invincible.

754
01:13:38,873 --> 01:13:42,544
So the only hope we have left
is finding the actual Warrior Blade

755
01:13:42,627 --> 01:13:45,547
and keeping it from him
until after the next blood moon.

756
01:13:48,049 --> 01:13:49,968
-That's tomorrow.
- Then we still have time.

757
01:14:17,037 --> 01:14:19,372
Luna, I know you have some hard feelings,

758
01:14:19,456 --> 01:14:22,417
but I wanted you to at least know
your family's story.

759
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,253
A man named Hirano
was actually your father,

760
01:14:25,337 --> 01:14:29,132
the guardian of the Witch Blade,
a role inherited in his youth.

761
01:14:30,091 --> 01:14:32,677
But protecting the sword proved
a dangerous task.

762
01:14:35,096 --> 01:14:38,308
So he enlisted the help of witches
from around the world

763
01:14:38,391 --> 01:14:40,560
specializing in protective magic.

764
01:14:41,436 --> 01:14:44,230
He did not expect
to fall in love with a bruja.

765
01:14:45,398 --> 01:14:48,234
Hirano didn't want his daughter
to inherit his duty,

766
01:14:48,318 --> 01:14:50,654
So he sent Nita and his baby away.

767
01:14:51,196 --> 01:14:55,075
He would spend the rest of his days alone,
traveling with the blade.

768
01:14:55,158 --> 01:14:56,493
A moving target.

769
01:14:58,119 --> 01:14:59,579
Hana betrayed us.

770
01:14:59,663 --> 01:15:02,165
Warrior Blade at the Viragkert Cemetery.

771
01:15:02,248 --> 01:15:03,917
Oldest Arai grave site.

772
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:07,962
Shit!

773
01:15:08,672 --> 01:15:12,050
-Sorry. Excuse me. Shit. Sorry, sorry.
- Hey, watch it.

774
01:15:12,133 --> 01:15:13,385
Fuck. My bad.

775
01:15:22,769 --> 01:15:23,770
-Not mine.
-Not me.

776
01:15:23,853 --> 01:15:25,397
Definitely not mine.

777
01:15:26,398 --> 01:15:27,482
It's mine.

778
01:15:29,984 --> 01:15:31,528
It's from Luna.

779
01:15:31,611 --> 01:15:32,904
"Viragkert Cemetery."

780
01:15:34,155 --> 01:15:36,074
Looks like she found the Warrior Blade.

781
01:15:36,157 --> 01:15:38,493
Dash sent her a message before he died.

782
01:15:39,744 --> 01:15:42,414
Luna's tablet seems to be moving
towards the cemetery.

783
01:15:42,497 --> 01:15:43,873
She's going after it.

784
01:15:43,957 --> 01:15:45,291
You guys go find Luna.

785
01:15:45,375 --> 01:15:48,169
I'll gather my men and the weapons.
We'll meet later.

786
01:15:48,253 --> 01:15:49,671
Shinshiro's safe house.

787
01:16:17,490 --> 01:16:18,992
This looks pretty old.

788
01:16:30,003 --> 01:16:32,172
God, I hope this is the right grave.

789
01:17:36,569 --> 01:17:37,904
Join me, Luna.

790
01:17:39,489 --> 01:17:42,033
I can help you become
what you were meant to be.

791
01:17:45,078 --> 01:17:49,415
I've known a lot of men like you,
and I've survived just fine without them.

792
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:52,669
But with me, you'll have the power
to do more than just survive.

793
01:17:53,461 --> 01:17:55,797
My magic makes yours stronger.

794
01:17:56,965 --> 01:17:58,883
You can live a new life.

795
01:17:58,967 --> 01:18:02,470
A fresh start, where you belong.

796
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:05,390
You know, if I was still in my teens,

797
01:18:06,015 --> 01:18:08,184
my daddy issues would've
eaten that shit up.

798
01:18:12,730 --> 01:18:15,567
-I'll take that, thank you very much.

799
01:18:24,742 --> 01:18:25,952
We were too late.

800
01:18:27,996 --> 01:18:30,290
-Don't tell me you failed.
-And your men?

801
01:18:31,249 --> 01:18:33,751
They've been alerted. It takes time.

802
01:18:33,835 --> 01:18:35,169
The blood moon is tomorrow,

803
01:18:35,253 --> 01:18:39,257
and now we have to assume Yurei has
both halves of the sword and Luna.

804
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:41,593
So we're back to square one.

805
01:18:42,635 --> 01:18:44,178
I think I might have a lead.

806
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:46,723
I'm still tracking Luna's tablet.

807
01:18:47,307 --> 01:18:49,475
Think Yurei doesn't know, huh?

808
01:18:49,559 --> 01:18:52,937
He'll be waiting for us,
and we're way outnumbered.

809
01:18:54,355 --> 01:18:55,565
Like it or not,

810
01:18:55,648 --> 01:18:59,694
we kill Yurei tonight, or we die tomorrow.

811
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:02,340
They're here.

812
01:20:03,341 --> 01:20:06,094
Reo, Nikko,
take the fight to the next car.

813
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:07,971
Kill whatever makes it through us.

814
01:20:08,054 --> 01:20:09,806
I don't take orders from you.

815
01:20:12,225 --> 01:20:13,726
But it's not a bad plan.

816
01:20:50,722 --> 01:20:52,098
Fuck this.

817
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:18,833
Whoo!

818
01:22:43,709 --> 01:22:46,295
-Where the fuck are we?

819
01:22:46,379 --> 01:22:47,672
We're getting off here.

820
01:22:55,805 --> 01:22:57,265
You sure about this?

821
01:22:57,348 --> 01:22:58,683
Not really.

822
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,977
But here goes nothing.

823
01:23:39,891 --> 01:23:43,060
Soon, the sword's full power will be mine.

824
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:46,189
The samurai are on their way.

825
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,900
It is finally time to destroy them

826
01:23:49,483 --> 01:23:53,154
and for the ninja to take
our long-overdue seat at the table.

827
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:55,072
And you, my ninja brother,

828
01:23:55,823 --> 01:23:59,035
were the patient rot from within
that made this possible.

829
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:01,996
The samurai's arrogance will cost them.

830
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:05,750
We should split up.

831
01:25:07,353 --> 01:25:10,439
It appears your friends have joined
the celebration.

832
01:25:10,523 --> 01:25:11,941
Come on.

833
01:25:12,024 --> 01:25:15,069
I came with you.
You said you wouldn't hurt them.

834
01:25:15,945 --> 01:25:17,989
Another chance to prove your worth.

835
01:25:18,614 --> 01:25:20,866
Wait. What does that mean? Stop!

836
01:25:20,950 --> 01:25:22,702
You promised!

837
01:25:41,846 --> 01:25:44,640
I hope you fight better than your sister.

838
01:25:49,812 --> 01:25:51,814
Lord Nikko must be here somewhere.

839
01:25:54,025 --> 01:25:55,276
Stay here.

840
01:26:08,289 --> 01:26:11,375
Some of us respect our sacred traditions.

841
01:26:12,585 --> 01:26:14,628
Guns do not defeat magic.

842
01:26:16,505 --> 01:26:19,258
- Get them to safety.
-Go! Go!

843
01:26:27,892 --> 01:26:30,102
I have to hand it to you, Ikeda.

844
01:26:30,686 --> 01:26:32,104
Faking your own death.

845
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:35,232
You're one sneaky bastard.

846
01:26:39,278 --> 01:26:42,531
I'm gonna cut that pompous tongue
from your mouth.

847
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,043
About time.

848
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:56,337
Thought you were gonna bitch out.

849
01:26:59,965 --> 01:27:01,675
I'll let my sword do the talking.

850
01:28:08,200 --> 01:28:09,076
Reo!

851
01:28:13,873 --> 01:28:14,874
No!

852
01:28:19,211 --> 01:28:21,130
-Where'd he go?
-I didn't see him!

853
01:28:22,798 --> 01:28:24,133
-Where--
-I didn't see him!

854
01:28:26,719 --> 01:28:27,678
Cover us!

855
01:29:22,233 --> 01:29:23,234
Fuck.

856
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:26,487
Fuck!

857
01:29:32,993 --> 01:29:33,994
Shit.

858
01:29:35,120 --> 01:29:36,330
Where the fuck is he?

859
01:31:29,985 --> 01:31:31,070
Fuck yeah!

860
01:31:53,550 --> 01:31:55,010
This is for my sister.

861
01:32:32,715 --> 01:32:34,341
You can end this now, Luna.

862
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:37,553
But you're gonna have to make a decision.

863
01:32:39,179 --> 01:32:40,305
Them...

864
01:32:42,182 --> 01:32:43,392
or your family.

865
01:34:05,432 --> 01:34:07,684
The sword! Keep it away from him.

866
01:34:28,288 --> 01:34:29,164
Reo!

867
01:34:31,500 --> 01:34:33,043
Luna, the sword.

868
01:35:16,545 --> 01:35:19,339
On behalf of all samurai,

869
01:35:20,716 --> 01:35:22,301
I send you to hell.

870
01:35:43,488 --> 01:35:44,656
Reo!

871
01:36:23,153 --> 01:36:24,947
They must be on the other side. Let's go.

872
01:36:47,970 --> 01:36:50,472
Here's your fucking sword back!

873
01:36:53,225 --> 01:36:57,729
I told you you're not the last descendant.
You're a witch, like me.

874
01:37:23,839 --> 01:37:24,923
Onami!

875
01:37:31,054 --> 01:37:34,016
Shinshiro found her as a baby
and he raised her as if she was his own.

876
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:35,976
Nobody knows her ancestry.

877
01:37:36,059 --> 01:37:40,272
The Blade of the 47 Ronin
will be wielded by a true descendant.

878
01:37:45,235 --> 01:37:46,069
You.

879
01:37:47,738 --> 01:37:49,865
-You're the one.

880
01:38:31,198 --> 01:38:33,158
-Holy fuck.
- Yeah.

881
01:38:37,412 --> 01:38:38,789
Well done.

882
01:38:40,749 --> 01:38:41,958
We should get going.

883
01:39:21,706 --> 01:39:23,083
It's cool, man.

884
01:39:24,501 --> 01:39:25,961
Don't mind if I do.

885
01:39:28,046 --> 01:39:29,047
Thanks.

886
01:39:31,424 --> 01:39:34,678
Wow. Ancient magical weapons
look good on you.

887
01:39:34,761 --> 01:39:38,598
Thanks.
I guess vintage is becoming my thing now.

888
01:39:40,350 --> 01:39:42,227
Hey, listen, I appreciate the invite,

889
01:39:42,310 --> 01:39:44,938
but, um, are you sure
you want me in there with you?

890
01:39:45,522 --> 01:39:46,481
Of course.

891
01:39:47,858 --> 01:39:49,234
Then I'll follow wherever you lead.

892
01:39:50,026 --> 01:39:53,029
Hey. You ready?

893
01:39:53,780 --> 01:39:56,783
-Are you ready?
-Look, I'm wearing a suit.

894
01:39:56,867 --> 01:40:00,328
Can't wait to bring a witch
to the samurai summit.

895
01:40:00,412 --> 01:40:01,997
Okay, Prophecy Girl.

896
01:40:04,374 --> 01:40:05,584
Mmm.

897
01:40:12,924 --> 01:40:14,134
I'll see you guys in there.

898
01:40:17,512 --> 01:40:18,722
Go get 'em, tiger.

899
01:40:53,215 --> 01:40:54,382
Lord Okoro.

900
01:40:56,509 --> 01:40:57,886
Lord Maeda.

901
01:40:59,012 --> 01:41:02,182
The battle we fought
has claimed many invaluable lives.

902
01:41:02,766 --> 01:41:07,312
But we found within our clan
the strength to fight back.

903
01:41:07,896 --> 01:41:14,402
And that is why today we welcome
the onna-bugeisha into our samurai family.

904
01:41:14,486 --> 01:41:18,823
Now I'd like to yield the floor
to Lord Onami.

905
01:41:23,411 --> 01:41:25,580
Thank you, Lord Nikko.

906
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:04,661
