00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Did I tell you? If anyone knows this, you will be in trouble.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.000
Madam, please. Mr. Tian will die.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
What does homosexual mean?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
It refers to a man who loves another man.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.000
Or we call them gay. 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.000
A person of your kind can get married and have heirs.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.000
A homosexual like me can have an heir.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.000
But I don't want to, Mother. 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.000
Mr. Tian is homosexual. He's gay.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.000
Aren't you going to tell Tian's secret? Tell me then. 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.000
If you don't have enough money, I won't dare to risk.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
They will solve the problem for us.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Do we have to do this?

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.000
We have no other choice, Madam. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Dong. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Dong. 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.000
Madam Chan. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Dong's voice.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.000
I didn't see anyone, 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.000
and I didn't hear anyone either. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
It is called beetle orchid.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
It is a poisonous mushroom that grows in the insects.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
It usually doesn't grow in human. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But I ground it and mixed it with special ingredients for you. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Its poison would make you numb, unable to move.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
If you breathes in or consumed it, 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
it will accelerate its growth in your body.

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.000
Sucking your blood and flesh as its food.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
After that, 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
the poisonous mushrooms will grow all over the body

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
and torture you to death.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But don't worry.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
You won't suffer that much.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Jia. 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
If you aren't comfortable to stay here, you can go back. I'll see you later. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Be careful.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Guanyin, Goddess of Mercy.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I've made a mistake,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
but I need to do it

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000
for my son.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Done, Madam. 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Li.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Where is she?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Mr. Song, something bad happened. 

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.000
What happened?

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:59.000
Dong went missing. 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Where will he be? Are you searching through the place?

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Have you found him?

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000
He can't go missing so easily.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Father. 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
How is it?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.100
I didn't see him. 

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
I think if Dong didn't run away, 

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
He must have been drunk at the bar like he usually does. 

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I don't think so. 

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
If you want to know where Dong is, ask Madam Li. 

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000
What are you talking about?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Right. 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Aunt Chan talked like Mother knows about Dong's disappearance.

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:51.000
The other day, Dong came to me, 

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.000
saying he got something important to talk about.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.000
But Madam Li intervened and took him away.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Since then, when I asked him anything, 

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.000
he never said again.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Last night I looked for him at his room. 

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000
But he's gone already. 

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.000
I don't know what he's like now. 

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And most importantly, 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000
the incident happened after Dong had a fight with Tian.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
His disappearance must have something to do with it.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.000
How is it relevant?

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:30.000
It is. Madam Li killed Dong to protect Tian. 

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
What do you mean?

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.000
It's about… / Shut up.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
I speak the truth, sir. It is …

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.000
I told you to shut up.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
In front of so many people, how could you talk like this?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
You guys.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Go talk to me in the hall.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Chan. 

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:27.000
You must be careful with your words when you were in front of many workers.

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.000
You said that Dong disappeared last night?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Yes. Nuan and I went looking for him all night and couldn't find him. 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000
I thought it might Madam who did this. 

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
You can't accuse me without evidence like this. 

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:49.000
Despite no evidence, it is a fact.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
The other day, Dong was going to tell me a secret about Tian.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
This secret that can put him out of the family leadership position.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:02.000
Then later, Dong harassed and attacked a worker. 

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000
He also disrespected Tian.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000
But she gave in to Dong. 

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
It was clear that

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:15.000
this must definitely be about Tian's secret.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Tian's secret?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000
What is this about?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Does Tian have a secret?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
I doubt that.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:28.000
What secret?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Dong must have seen that Chan was trying to push Yang

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
to become the clan leader instead of Tian.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:39.000
So he made up a story to trick Chan for money.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Consider it carefully, sir.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000
When Dong said that he knew the secret, 

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.000
he suddenly disappeared.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I couldn't help thinking that he has been killed already. 

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Madam.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000
You'd better confess what you did to Dong last night. 

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:02.000
Stop accusing Madam Li, please. 

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Mr. Song is a wise and rational man. He won't listen to your nonsense. 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Right.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
I'm rational. 

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Li.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Where have you been last night?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000
I woke up in the middle of the night, 

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
but I didn't see you there.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000
I had a bad dream, so I went to the Buddhist altar.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
You never pray at the Buddhist altar. 

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Once a man went missing, you immediately did it.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Mr. Song. 

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Think carefully who benefits from this.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.000
One missing worker.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000
But you make a fuss and blame Madam Li despite the lack of evidence.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Maybe it's you

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000
who did it and blamed Madam Li.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.000
Why did I do that?

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Framing Madam to make your son replace Mr. Tian.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Alright. 

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
If you think you're innocent…

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Mr. Song. 

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
I think we should report the police. 

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Let them investigate to find out the truth.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000
And if anyone is found guilty, put the person in jail.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.800
Father. 

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
We found Dong.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Dong. 

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Dong is really dead. 

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:21.300
Madam.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
You are so cruel and ruthless.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Do you have to kill him?

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Does this mean Dong didn't drown?

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:36.000
Calm down. 

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.000
No one killed Dong. He drowned in the river. 

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
He may be drowned in the water.

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.000
What are you saying, Mom?

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Dong sailed away and the boat capsized.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
Bua was the one who found the body.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000
Bua, tell me what it is. 

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:56.000
This morning when I took the boat back from the market.

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:01.000
I saw that there was a body floating in the lotuses over there. 

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Bua. 

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Why didn't you tell him

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.000
that last night we went looking for Dong. 

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
We heard his voice in the back garden.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Last night when I came out to collect my clothes, 

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.000
I did meet Chan and Nuan.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Dong. 

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:47.000
Dong. 

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Bua.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Did you see Dong pass by?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000
I don't see him.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:59.000
But I'm not sure I heard Dong's voice.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
What is this pouch?

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000
That's the workers' wages that I prepared. 

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Did Dong steal everyone's wages and fled?

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
He was so evil. 

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:43.000
That's why he bought Mud stuff and asked her to go out.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000
So he actually stole other's stuff.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
In fact, 

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
After Dong had a fight with Tian.

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.000
I called him to talk again.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
But he became aggressive and disrespected me as well. 

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.000
So I gave him final offer to get out of here.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
But I didn't think that

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
he would steal the workers' wages and ran away and drowned like this.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
This must be your plan.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Killing him, putting the wages at him and framed him for stealing money.

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.000
That's too much, Madam Chan. 

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Use your brain. 

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:24.000
How could Madam and I fight Dong?

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.000
Look at his body size. 

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000
That's right. Dong was so strong.

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.000
Shut up. 

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Yang.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Check Dong again. 

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Is there something wrong?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Is there anything more?

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
No. 

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.000
He must have really drowned

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000
because there were no traces of fighting. 

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
If you kept quiet about Tian,

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
you wouldn't probably meet an end like this.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Then it means Dong stole the workers' money

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
and ran away, 

00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:15.000
but the ship turned upside down and then drowned.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
It's a mess. 

00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:20.000
Mr. Song. 

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Mom. 

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
If you don't have evidence about the murder, 

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.000
you shouldn't accuse Madam Li. 

00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.000
Hey, why are you siding with her?

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Don't you want the position of the clan leader?

00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:51.000
No. 

00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:55.000
I prefer to be a follower. I'm fine now, Mom.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Mother. 

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Stop looking for a way to make me take the position from Tian.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000
He is my brother and my benefactor.

00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.000
He also saved my life.

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.000
If I take the position from him, that means I betray him.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
So what you're doing now doesn't mean you betray me? Ungrateful son.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:19.000
I really asked you.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000
You want to be inferior to him for the rest of your life?

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000
Don't you see 

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000
what it's like to be second?

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:31.000
No matter what I say or do, no one listens and believes me. 

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000
But look at Madam Li, 

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:35.000
everyone always follows her. 

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
That's because her words are reasonable.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.000
And look at you, you said everything loud like this, who would believe you?

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.000
I didn't yell for no reason. 

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.000
Everything is reasonable, 

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000
but no one listens to me

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
because no one care about me.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
You too. If you were the eldest child, 

00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:00.000
even if you were a rascal, everyone still respected you.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.000
I must know 

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000
what Tian’s secret that will shake the position of the clan leader is?

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Mother. 

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Tian.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Come in. 

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
I made bamboo pith soup for you.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Thank you my son. 

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Mother. 

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000
About Dong's death…

00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.000
Do you also think that I did it?

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000
I said that I talked to him to fire him.

00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:24.000
He must have been mad, so he stole the money and were drowned while running away.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
He didn't die because he knew about me, did he?

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Of course not.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
How would he know?

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
When I, Jia and you didn't speak.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Yes, Mother. 

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I'm sorry for doubting you.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
That's okay. 

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Remember that

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I love you so much. 

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
When you found Dong's body this morning, 

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:26.000
did you see anything strange?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Not at all. It was normal. 

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Why?

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Don't you think that Dong drowned?

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.000
I am just wondering.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
I'm just not sure, so I ask you.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Not sure? What's that you're not sure?

00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.500
Or …
Does Mr. Tian really have a secret?

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:58.000
So you suspected that Madam Li killed Dong.

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
There's no secret.

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000
If you didn't see anything, that's fine. 

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Hey, how is it? Have you found the evidence of Dong's murder?

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
No, Madam. 

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
I guess there's nothing here. 

00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:29.000
If I were Madam Li or Jia, 

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I would have destroyed all the evidence.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000
I'm really curious

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.000
who they both managed to attack a big guy like Dong?

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
Aunt Jia.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.000
Where did you guys put Dong's body?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
I heard the workers saying they would take the body to the temple.

00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:07.000
But I don't know what temple. 

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Why do you ask about Dong's body all of a sudden?

00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:14.000
What that has to do with you?

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.000
I'm just wondering. Usually, you don't care about him. 

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.000
But when he died, you asked about him.

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Ew, you talking about body and body again. 

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000
I can't eat anything. 

00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:30.000
I can still imagine Dong's bloated body. 

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000
Mud, at first I forgot about it already. 

00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.000
When you said that, I could see it too. 

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Madam Li asked me to take care of the workers.

00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:42.000
Even if he was a bad guy, 

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:46.000
But we have take care of his funeral ceremony.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.000
Did he have any relatives?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
He didn't have any relatives.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
We've already carried his body to the temple.

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Is that so?

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000
And what temple did you take Dong's body to?

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
The workers said that Dong's body was taken to a Thai temple near the end of the market.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:11.000
I think I should follow to destroy the body.

00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:15.000
Otherwise there will be evidence that he died unnaturally.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Please take care of it, Jia. 

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
It is called beetle orchid.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
It is a poisonous mushroom that grows in the insects.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000
If you breathes in or consumed it, 

00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:42.000
it will accelerate its growth in your body.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Sucking your blood and flesh as its food.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000
After that, 

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
the poisonous mushrooms will grow all over the body

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.000
You don't think that Dong drowned?

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.000
So you come to inspect the boat again.

00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.000
I just wanted to make sure that no one really attacked Dong. 

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Since he died in our home like this.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
The more I examined it, the more I found it strange.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
But the crack is …

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
It got sharp edges like that when someone punched it.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Bua.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Didn't you see anything?

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.000
Mr. Yang.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
When I found a dead body, there was nothing strange about it.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
But the night before the body was found, 

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000
I looked out of my house and saw something.

00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.000
A silhouette of someone. 

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000
She looks like …

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Madam Li. 

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
That night, Madam Li came out in the middle of the night too?

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.000
I think it probably was. But Mr. Yang, 

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
she wasn't the only one who came out that night. 

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000
I was out there and met Madam Chan and Nuan as well. 

00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.000
I told you that I went out to find Dong

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
because I had something to talk to him. 

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:36.000
Are you manipulating my son?

00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.200
Bua didn't do anything, Mom. 

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Then why are you talking about it?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Or do you suspect about Dong's death as well?

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Who is suspicious? Is it Madam Li?

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:50.000
Me too. 

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000
If we work together, we can find a way to expose her.

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Bua. 

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Mr. Song and Madam Li want to see you. 

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Bua is here. 

00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Sit down. 

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000
What would you like me to do, Sir, Madam?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Tian, come in, come in. Bua is here now. 

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.000
What is this, Madam, Sir?

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Li discussed with me.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:16.000
She wants to let you

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000
become Tian's adoptive mother.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Madam.

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.000
I see that you love Tian like your real child

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:29.000
and always watch over him. 

00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.000
So today I want to make it formal.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Everyone will know that you are Tian's second mother.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
But I don't want to…

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.000
Aunt Bua.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
You don't want to be my mother?

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:49.000
Tian. 

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.000
Please. 

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Tian has been kneeling down for a while now. His kneels hurt. 

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
Hurry, Tian. Give her the tea. 

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:13.000
Tian. 

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Madam Li must have a plan. 

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Bua, eat more. 

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Thank you, Madam. 

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.000
Have some vegetables, Bua.

00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:53.000
Thanks.
Here yours, sir.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Today we're having dinner together.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000
I really have good appetite.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Li, thank you

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
for being generous to Bua. 

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.000
I'm the one who has to thank her

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000
for taking care of Tian for more than ten years.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Today, I let Tian be your son as well.

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Hope you love, care for and protect Tian

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
just like a mother should do for her child.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000
So that's why!

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:34.000
You want Bua to protect Tian.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
What did he do?

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Why does he need two mothers to protect him?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Mom. 

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Chan. 

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:51.000
Is it very painful for you to see Li and Bua getting along well?

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:56.000
Instead of being happy that our family lives peacefully, 

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
you keep nitpicking. 

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000
When I say something,

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000
it turns out that I'm slandering others, right?

00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:06.000
You always cause trouble. 

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
You'd better take your time to take care of Yang. 

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
So he won't be ridiculous like this. 

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Father, please calm down.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Yang was not that ridiculous at all.

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.000
Don't pretend to help him!

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.000
Chan. 

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Is Yang my child alone?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Isn't he your son as well?

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:28.000
Why is it my fault to raise the kid alone?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Why don't you think that it's because you don't love your sons equally?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Mom, that's okay. 

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.000
Don't say anything that is not auspicious.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
There are good food here. Let's eat.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.000
Because of you. You are like this.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Not serious about anything.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Listen carefully.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
If I didn't think Yang is my son, 

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
I would have drove you and him out earlier. 

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Please stop, Sir. 

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Right, I slander other people.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:16.000
And my son is ridiculous. 

00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:19.000
There's nothing good about the two of us at all, right?

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Mom. 

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000
Mom. 

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Chan. 

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Sir, don't be mad at this nonsense. 

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Come on.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Let's eat. 

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Please excuse me.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:55.000
You see it now?

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000
He's never care about us. 

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
No matter what I say or do,

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000
It is annoying in his eyes.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
I'm the daughter of a lord.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:22.000
But your father listens to that low-class opera lead actress like Li rather than me. 

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
It's okay.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000
It's alright. 

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
In the past, I used to think

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
that if you behave well and do your job, 

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000
your father probably appreciates the two of us more.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
But I know now. No matter how good we are, 

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
we'll just stay in the same place.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
You know why?

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Because I'm just the second wife.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
I always have to be under the first wife.

00:39:04.700 --> 00:39:07.000
No one respects and listens to me. 

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Mom, listen to me. 

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.000
No matter what Father or whoever says, 

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000
but for me, 

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000
you are the most valuable. No need to be praised by anyone.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
If it were only me, 

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
I got used to it. 

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:38.000
But I couldn't bear to see you as his subordinate for the rest of your life.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
So I struggle to do everything for you.

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000
When I know that Tian has a big secret

00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:49.000
to the extent that Madam Li struggled to cover it up, I can't let go of this.

00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:51.000
But I don't want you to interfere.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.800
Do you know it's dangerous?

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Taking a risk it better than living under the wicked.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
I will prove that she killed people to hide a secret for Tian.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Evil people shouldn't live a good life. 

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Noi. 

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000
The newspaper announced that a new mall has opened. There's a lot of stuff there. 

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Do you think they will accept more workers?

00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:39.000
Oh my lady.

00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.000
Do you really have to find jobs?

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
I've studied a lot. I should go out and earn money.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Or …

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Should I work at this newspaper?

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000
I'm an educated woman. I won't starve to death.

00:40:55.300 --> 00:40:58.000
Come, come, come in

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Please go wait over there. 

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.000
Noi, take them to wait over there first.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.000
Yes, please. 

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Who are they, Father?

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:18.800
Well …

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:23.000
I see that you look for jobs seriously.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.000
I am not at ease as well.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
I want to make money too. 

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Now, luck is on our side. 

00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:36.000
These people told me that the Japanese soldiers are selling out the oil .

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
They will sell it to us cheaply.

00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:42.000
After receiving the oil, we'll sell it further.

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:45.000
It will be very profitable.

00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Did they secretly stole the oil from the Japanese?

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:53.000
Hey, even they stole it, 

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.000
we know how much the Japanese soldiers 

00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.000
are taking advantage of our country, 

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.000
so they deserve it. 

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000
If we get the oil, it must sell well.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
We will be able become a millionaire like before. 

00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.000
This is the advantage of war.

00:42:12.500 --> 00:42:14.000
Father.

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.000
Don't scold me. 

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Just this one time.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.000
Later, if you are married to Tian, 

00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.000
we won't suffer anymore.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Okay?

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Li

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
What's the matter. 

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000
About Dong…

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000
I let people search for his relatives but they couldn't find them.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
The body was taken out of the water.

00:43:13.400 --> 00:43:14.000
It shouldn't be stored for a very long time.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000
I think we should hurry and cremate it. 

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.000
That's true. 

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.000
He died unnaturally and in the water.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
But I think I think we shouldn't burn it yet.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Why?

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
When the body was found,

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
all the workers heard Chan said 

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000
that you may be involved in his death. 

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:52.000
If we hurry to burn it now, 

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.000
people will think that we are hiding something.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000
But the evidence is clear already

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
that Dong stole the money and ran away.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Don't you believe me and still doubt in me?

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000
I believe in the evidence.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000
If you didn't do it, 

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000
you don't have to worry.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
One more thing, 

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
due to Zhang's death last time, 

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
the association members haven't got along well like before.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Maybe someone will take this opportunity to frame you again.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Wait another seven days.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000
If relatives or someone else doesn't complain about Dong's death, 

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000
until that day, we can burn the body. 

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
So that no one can accuse us. 

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Hurry up and look at Dong's body. 

00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.000
I'm sure there must be something.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Otherwise, Madam Li won't care about his body and hurry for the cremation.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
There's probably nothing.

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:15.000
because I didn't see any wounds or bruises when he was brought out from the water. 

00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:17.000
No wounds and no injuries, 

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.000
but he may not drown normally. 

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Have you forgotten that Jia is good at concocting pills?

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000
She might use poison to kill Dong and threw him into the water. 

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Dong, my master ordered me to do.

00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.000
I didn't insult you at all.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Oh, Mr. Yang. I was so shocked. I thought it was Dong's ghost.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000
I'm scared. 

00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.000
If it was Dong's ghost, he would have killed you for sure.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Why are you messing with his body?

00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.000
No, it's Madam Chan.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
It's nothing. Madam Chan doesn't know about it. 

00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.000
I came here on my own. I just wanted to pay homage to Dong's body.

00:47:23.500 --> 00:47:26.000
Because when he was alive, I often argued with him.

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:27.000
Don't lie. 

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
I saw you sneaking out of the house.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:32.000
So I followed you here. 

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
What did she tell you to do?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Hmm?

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Someone's coming. 

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Are you really going to sleep here?

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
You don't have to watch over him actually.

00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:03.000
There's nothing valuable in the coffin.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
No one would steal it.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.000
It's an order of my boss. 

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Up to you, I'll go get you a pillow and a mat.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000
Madam let Aunt Jia sleep here and watch over Dong's body herself?

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.000
You ca go now. 

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
If someone sees Dong's body in this condition, we'll be in trouble.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
What?

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Did Madam Li let Jia sleep there and watch over the body?

00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:24.800
Yes, Madam. 

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
It means we're on the right direction. There must be something with the body.

00:49:29.400 --> 00:49:32.000
Actually I almost got the information

00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.000
if Mr. Yang didn't interfere it. 

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:38.000
Now it's hard to go back or find evidence from the body. 

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
What's wrong with my son?

00:49:43.300 --> 00:49:45.000
He's always in my way all the time?

00:49:45.500 --> 00:49:49.000
I understand that he loves and wants to protect his brother.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
But I don't get it why he intervenes and helps conceal the murderer.

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.000
It's because this has something to do with Mr. Tian. 

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
If Madam Li and Jia really did this, 

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
the person who would be in trouble is Mr. Tian.

00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:03.000
So Mr. Yang wants to help them.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000
So what are we going to do next?

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Since we can't handle this by ourselves, 

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
we have to lend other's hands to help us. 

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Are you really going to sleep here?

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
You don't have to watch over him actually.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
There's nothing valuable in the coffin.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.000
No one would steal it.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:37.000
It's an order of my boss. 

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Why did Aunt Jia have to guard Dong's body?

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
What is she afraid of?

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Lady Pin. 

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Lady Pin. 

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Are you here to see Tian? He's not here.

00:51:07.300 --> 00:51:08.000
He's gone to the warehouse.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:11.000
No. I'd like to see Aunt Li.

00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:13.000
Madam Li is not here. She went out with Aunt Jia.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
What about Mr. Song?

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Father is not here too. 

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Lady. 

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Do you have any business?

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Too bad, I'd like to ask them to help stop my father.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
What did your father do?

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000
No, sir. 

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
No, please. 

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Lady Pin orders me to stop you from buying it. 

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Nangnoi. 

00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.000
Will you believe my daughter or me?

00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:55.000
I believe Lady Pin. 

00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.000
But I don't believe you and I will buy it.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Stop right now. 

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Who is this Japanese soldier?

00:52:39.500 --> 00:52:42.000
We …

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
We have been informed that someone had stolen the oil for sale.

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Sir, don't harm my father. 

00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.000
He was deceived. We didn't mean to do so. I'm really sorry, sir.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Father.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Quiet!

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:07.000
The offender must be punished.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
He must be strapped to the board

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
and received waterboarding. 

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
You have misunderstood.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000
We didn't steal your oil.

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:20.000
If you don't believe me, come and see here.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.000
There is only one tank of oil bought from a gas station. Other twos are plain water.

00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:34.000
Right! Only one tank of oil. 

00:53:34.100 --> 00:53:35.000
Yes. 

00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:37.000
What? What do you mean?

00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:39.000
Are you guys deceiving me?

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000
Father, Father.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Sir, don't punish Father. He was fooled.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:09.000
Yes, I really don't know.

00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:10.200
But …

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:15.000
If there is one tank of oil and the rest is water, 

00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:18.000
that means I didn't steal oil. I'm not guilty. 

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
What not guilty?

00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:25.000
This is considered cooperation with them.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Impersonate Japanese soldiers

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Sir, please don't pour oil into Father's mouth.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.000
Please. 

00:54:36.100 --> 00:54:37.000
No.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Fine. 

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.000
For the sake of your daughter's gratitude, 

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:49.000
I will not press charges.

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000
But don't do this again in the future. 

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Be obedient to your daughter.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Do you understand?

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Yes, I will listen to my daughter from now on. 

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Good.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Enjoy your meal, Mr. Yang.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.000
I'll buy this meal for you. 

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.000
It's alright, you don't have much money now, right?

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000
I'm still okay for this. You helped me today. 

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:34.000
Otherwise, my father would probably got scammed and lost more money.

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Then I think the noodles are too cheap. 

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000
For a Japanese soldier like me, I'd rather eat something more expensive.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:57.000
If I report the Japanese soldiers that someone was impersonating them, 

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
how do you think he will be punished?

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
So the noodles are fine for me. 

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Let's eat. 

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Boy. 

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:36.600
Sorry. 

00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.200
I'm sorry.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Thanks. 

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000
I'm so sorry.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Let's go.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Thank you for today. 

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
But no matter what, 

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:05.000
the only way I can save my palace is to marry Tian.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Lady Pin. 

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Tian definitely doesn't love you.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Do you really love him?

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
Tian is handsome, polite and kind.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Whoever gets married to him will be happy.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
I didn't ask if you are getting married.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000
I asked if you love him.

00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:31.000
It doesn't change a thing. 

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
I will have to marry Tian for my palace's survival.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Anyway, thanks again for today.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
I got to go back. 

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Don’t accompany me. 

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000
It's getting worse each day. 

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:54.000
I don't know who else to ask for help to sort this out.

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:57.000
I think of you 

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
as the only one I can count on. 

00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Do you think Li has something to do with the death of a worker?

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
And what about Big Brother?

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000
He doesn't say anything.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Honestly, I still couldn't find any evidence that could clearly sue Madam Li.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:28.000
If this leaks out, 

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:31.000
The Five Dragons Association will definitely be damaged. 

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.000
But are you sure

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
that you really came here for this reason?

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Not because you want to borrow my hands to get rid of Li and Tian

00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:51.000
to let your son Yang to take the position of Big Brother?

00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.000
Right?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000
I am joking. 

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Everyone knows how much you loves 

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:15.000
and are loyal to the Song Family and our Five Dragons Association.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Yes, sir. 

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
I have brought you the news. How you'll handle it

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000
is up to you.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:32.000
And I was sure that 

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:40.000
no matter what you do, you are also loyal to the association just like me.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:43.000
It's definitely not for your own benefit.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Do you think Mr. Ma will help us?

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:59.000
If he really help us, the Song family's reputation would be damaged.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.000
Will Mr. Song be in trouble?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000
He's a talented man. He can handle this matter.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:09.000
Besides, now we need to find a way to get Madam Li and Tian as quickly as possible.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.000
Are you sure it's worth it?

01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:14.000
If we get caught, the two of us will be in real trouble.

01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:18.000
Doing this is like bringing enemies to our home.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.000
So is there any other way?

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Besides, I've already said it.

01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:24.000
We can't fix anything now. 

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:28.000
A man like Mr. Ma,

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.000
he won't let this matter go silent without doing anything absolutely. 

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
I'm really curious

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:40.000
what method Mr. Ma will use to deal with Madam Li and Dong's body.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
But can we trust Madam Chan?

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000
I'm afraid she will harm us later after we help her.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Because if this plan fails, 

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.000
Song won't probably be pleased that we mess with this matter.

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Just let him be. 

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:00.000
He can't even handle the incident in his own home.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000
How can he be the leader of our association.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Everyone knows about Chan and Li.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:13.000
They are competing for power to make their own children be the leader. 

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
So why do you help her and side with Chan?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
I didn't help her.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I helps people who give me benefits.

01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:28.000
If we succeed, Song Family and Big Brother's reputation would be tarnished.

01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:31.000
We will use this to destroy his credibility

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
and remove Big Brother from the head position of the Five Dragons Association.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.000
If you buy it as a gift for girls, they will definitely like it.

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Hey.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Don't cry, good boy. 

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Where is your parents? Hmm?

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I'm lost. 

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000
No. No. Don't harm me.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Help me, Mei. Help me. Help.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
You. 

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
How did you get here?

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
I thought you've already throw it away.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000
I think if see you again, I will return it.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:13.000
But I can't return it now. It's already stained.

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:16.000
It's okay. You keep it.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
So are you living here with your two siblings?

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Yes. 

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:31.000
My parents died when I was a kid.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Have you been raising them since you were a child?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
In the past, there was an aunt next door who helped take care of us. 

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
But she moved a long time ago.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
You are so good. 

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
I'm not.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000
If I were really good, my siblings would be happier by now. 

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.000
You are really good.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Your brother and sister look happy for me. 

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Come on, let me help. 

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:23.000
You got a splinter in your finger.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I'll take it out. It will hurt bit.

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Thanks. 

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Here.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:09.000
This is a film tape. 

01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:13.000
What is it? It was left outside, so I picked it up.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000
It's the film used for showing movie on the screen

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.000
to tell stories.

01:07:22.000 --> 01:07:24.000
I don't know it. I've never seen it. I want to see it.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Such a pity. 

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000
This is a war period. I can't take you two to watch it. 

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
How about this?

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000
I will find a movie for you to watch. I promise.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:41.100
Really? Promise me. 

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000
That day, when Bai Suzhen decided to come down to the human world, 

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
she found love with a handsome young man

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:08.000
and gave birth to a baby named Lin.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.000
However, a priest intervene. 

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:31.000
It's dark outside. 

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Let's go. I'll see you out. 

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Thank you very much for sending my brother home today.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Actually, I pass this area often

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.000
but never been in this this alley.

01:09:57.500 --> 01:09:59.000
Otherwise, 

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.000
The two of us must have known each other sooner. 

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Alright, it's the main road now. 

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Some day later, 

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000
shall we take the kids out for dessert? I have a favorite shop.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000
I think the kids will like it.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:26.000
I don't think so. 

01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000
Don't come here again.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Why?

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000
My world is like this alley.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
You just walk past and then leave. 

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
You shouldn't associate with it. 

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000
The two of us just happened to meet.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000
My world and your world are different worlds.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:59.000
But for me, we all live in the same world.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000
Whether you are rich or poor, 

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000
we can be friends.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000
You say this because you don't know my world.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
Good luck.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000
Stop, don't move the body anywhere.

01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:20.000
Open it. 

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000
What should we do?

01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.000
Whoever got involved in Dong's death

01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:30.000
and if it affects on the Five Dragons Association, 

01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.000
I will punish that person until the very end.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:37.000
If you are in trouble, come to me. My father can help you.

01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:38.000
Who is your father?

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000
These orchids can help us protect Mr. Tian's secret.

01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:44.000
Or is Mother with Aunt Jia?
