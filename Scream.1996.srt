00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:22,688
Hello?

2
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,729
Hello. Yes?

3
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,056
Who is this?

4
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,561
Who are you trying to reach?

5
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:28,893
What number is this?

6
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,727
What number are you trying to reach?

7
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:31,937
[ Don't know.

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,693
Well, I think you have the wrong number.

9
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,070
- Do I?
- It happens. Take it easy.

10
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,128
Hello?

11
00:00:46,213 --> 00:00:48,704
I'm sorry.
I guess I dialed the wrong number.

12
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,585
Well, so why'd you dial it again?

13
00:00:50,676 --> 00:00:52,291
To apologize.

14
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,172
You're forgiven. Bye now.

15
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:55,924
Wait. Wait. Don't hang up.

16
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,300
- What?
- / want to talk to you for a second.

17
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,053
They've got 900 numbers for that. See ya.

18
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:23,874
Hello?

19
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:25,950
Why don't you want to talk to me?

20
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,044
Who is this?

21
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:29,211
You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine.

22
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:31,379
I don't think so.

23
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:34,216
What's that noise?

24
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,339
- Popcorn.
- You're making popcorn?

25
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:39,175
I only eal popcorn at the movies.

26
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:41,177
Well, I'm getting ready to watch a video.

27
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,678
Really? What?

28
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,930
Oh, just some scary movie.

29
00:01:45,022 --> 00:01:46,558
You like scary movies?

30
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,139
What's your favorite scary movie?

31
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:50,770
I don't know.

32
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:53,352
You have fo have a favorite.
What comes fo mind?

33
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:56,317
Halloween.

34
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:58,747
You know, the one
with the guy in the white mask

35
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:00,909
who walks around and stalks babysitters.

36
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,487
- Yeah.
- What's yours?

37
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:04,617
Guess.

38
00:02:06,752 --> 00:02:08,333
Nightmare on elm street.

39
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,957
Is that the one
where the guy had knives for fingers?

40
00:02:11,048 --> 00:02:12,288
Yeah, Freddy krueger.

41
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:15,966
Freddy. Thats right.
I like that movie. It was scary.

42
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:18,510
Well, the first one was,
but the rest sucked.

43
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,633
So, you got a boyfriend?

44
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:24,095
Why? You wanna ask me out on a date?

45
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,643
Maybe. Do you have a boyfriend?

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,685
Why do you want to know my name?

47
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:33,688
'Cause I want fo know who I'm looking at.

48
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:36,812
What did you say?

49
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:40,240
I want fo know who I'm talking to.

50
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,567
That's not what you said.

51
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:42,902
What do you think I said?

52
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,406
What?

53
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,960
Hello?

54
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,911
Look, I gotta go.

55
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,837
Wait. I thought we were gonna go out.

56
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,295
Nah, I don't think so.

57
00:02:57,386 --> 00:02:58,592
Don't hang up on me.

58
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,559
Shit.

59
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:11,357
Yes?

60
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,183
I told you not fo hang up on me.

61
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:16,188
- What do you want?
- To talk.

62
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,520
Well, dial someone else, okay?

63
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:29,372
Listen, asshole...

64
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,995
No, you listen, you little bitch!

65
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:34,203
You hang up on me again,
I'll gut you like a fish, understand?

66
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,998
Yeah.

67
00:03:38,093 --> 00:03:40,049
Is this some kind of joke?

68
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,469
More of a game, really.

69
00:03:44,391 --> 00:03:45,972
Can you handle that...

70
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:49,176
Blondie?

71
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,780
Can you see me?

72
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:09,284
Listen. I am two seconds away
from calling the police.

73
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:13,617
They'd never make it in time.
We're out in the middle of nowhere.

74
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,327
What do you want?

75
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:18,664
To see what your insides look like.

76
00:04:27,017 --> 00:04:28,097
Who's there?

77
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:30,509
Who's there?

78
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,144
I'm calling the police.

79
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,187
You should never say, "who's there?”

80
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,894
Don't you watch scary movies?
It's a death wish.

81
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,111
You might as well come out here fo
investigate a strange noise or something.

82
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,161
Look...

83
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:51,497
You've had your fun now, so I think
you'd better just leave or else.

84
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,164
Or else what?

85
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,617
Or else my boyfriend
will be here any second,

86
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,953
and he'll be pissed when he finds out.

87
00:04:58,048 --> 00:04:59,584
[ Thought you didn't have a boyfriend.

88
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:02,040
I lied! I do have a boyfriend,

89
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,421
and he'll be here any second,
so your ass better be gone.

90
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:05,593
Sure.

91
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:07,838
I swear.

92
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:13,886
He's big, and he plays football,
and he'll kick the shit out of you!

93
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,595
I'm gelling scared.

94
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,226
I'm shaking in my boots.

95
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:20,017
So you'd better just leave.

96
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,942
His hame wouldn't be...

97
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,520
Steve, would it?

98
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,607
How do you know his name?

99
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,026
Turn on the patio lights...

100
00:05:30,914 --> 00:05:31,914
Again.

101
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,004
Oh, god!

102
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:47,673
I wouldn't ao that if I were you.

103
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:49,675
- Where are you? Where are you?
- Guess.

104
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:51,222
Please don't hurt him.

105
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:52,845
That all depends on you.

106
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,517
Why are you doing this?

107
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,061
- I want fo play a game.
- No.

108
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:59,730
- Then he dies right now.
- No! No!

109
00:05:59,818 --> 00:06:01,024
Which is it?

110
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,685
Which is it?

111
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,239
What kind of game?

112
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:12,319
Turn off the light.
You'll see what kind of game.

113
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,321
Just do it!

114
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:20,252
Casey! No! No!

115
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,375
No! Casey!

116
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,205
Here's how we play.

117
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:28,802
I ask a question.
If you get it right, Steve lives.

118
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,925
- Please. Please.
- It's an easy category. Movie trivia.

119
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,136
I'll even give you a warm-up question.

120
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,515
Don't do this. I can't...

121
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:41,724
- Name the killer in Halloween.
- No.

122
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,901
Come on. It's your favorite
scary movie, remember?

123
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:47,400
He had a white mask.
He stalked the babysitters.

124
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,446
- I don't know.
- Come on. Yes, you do.

125
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,867
- No. Please.
- What's his name?

126
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,912
- I can't think.
- Steve's counting on you.

127
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,121
Michael. Michael Myers.

128
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,702
Yes! Very good.

129
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,503
Now for the real question.

130
00:07:04,591 --> 00:07:07,003
- No!
- But you're doing so well.

131
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:08,883
We can't stop now.

132
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,506
Stop! Leave us alone.

133
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,259
Then answer the question. Same category.

134
00:07:14,476 --> 00:07:16,432
Oh, please, stop.

135
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:20,270
Name the killer in Friday the 13th.

136
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:22,848
Jason! Jason! Jason!

137
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,730
I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer.

138
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,187
No, it's not! No, it's not. It was Jason!

139
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,819
Afraid not. No way.

140
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:35,402
Listen. It was Jason.
I saw that movie 20 goddamn times!

141
00:07:35,497 --> 00:07:38,739
Then you should know Jason's mother,
Mrs. voorhees was the original killer.

142
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,324
Jason didn't show up until the sequel.

143
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:44,161
I'm afraid that was a wrong answer.

144
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,711
You tricked me.

145
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:52,011
Lucky for you, there's a bonus round,
but poor Steve. I'm afraid he's out.

146
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,530
Hey, we're not finished yet.

147
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:24,868
Final question. Are you ready?

148
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:29,380
Please. Please leave me alone.

149
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,173
Answer the question, and I will.

150
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,846
What door am [I at?

151
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,551
What?

152
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:41,601
There are two main doors to your house,
a front door and the patio doors.

153
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:44,430
If you answer correctly, you live.

154
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,764
Very simple.

155
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,475
Don't do this. I can't I won't

156
00:08:49,738 --> 00:08:51,148
your call.

157
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:16,422
Did you water over here today?

158
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:18,883
No, it was just that water from the rain.

159
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,130
They look great, don't they?

160
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,711
Don't they smell strong?

161
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,171
I told you we could send it back.

162
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,683
Mom.

163
00:11:29,564 --> 00:11:31,100
Jesus! What is it?

164
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,034
Casey!

165
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:51,078
Oh, god! Oh, god!

166
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,921
Casey? Casey?

167
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:58,714
Casey!

168
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,132
- Where is she?
- Call the police.

169
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,388
Casey!

170
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:11,678
- Casey, you upstairs?
- Oh, my god.

171
00:12:11,773 --> 00:12:13,183
Casey, baby?

172
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,606
- Where is she?
- She"s here.

173
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,480
- Mom... mom...
- Oh, my god. I can hear her.

174
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,982
Where is she?

175
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,191
Oh, my god. I can hear her.

176
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,576
Get in the car.

177
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,329
Drive down to the mackenzies.

178
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,376
No, not my daughter.

179
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,079
- Just go.
- Not my daughter.

180
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:39,380
Call the police.

181
00:13:23,428 --> 00:13:25,965
- It's just me.
- Billy, what the... what're you doing here?

182
00:13:26,055 --> 00:13:27,495
- Sorry. Don't hate me.
- Oh, my god.

183
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,183
Yes, I sleep in this. My dad is
in the other room. You can't be in here.

184
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,135
- I'll just stay a sec.
- No, you can't...

185
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,346
Oh, no. You gotta go. Go. Go.

186
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:37,931
What's going on in there?

187
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,562
- Are you okay?
- Can you knock?

188
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,484
- I heard screaming.
- No, you didn't.

189
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:43,572
No?

190
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,696
Oh, well.

191
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:50,576
I'm hitting the sack. My flight
leaves first thing in the morning.

192
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,530
Now, the expo runs all weekend,
so I won't be back till Sunday.

193
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,088
There's cash on the table,
and I'm staying at...

194
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,118
- The Hilton.
- Out at the airport, so call if...

195
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:01,420
- If I need anything. Yeah, I got it.
- I could've sworn I heard screaming.

196
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,378
Have a good trip, okay?

197
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,676
Sleep tight, sweetie.

198
00:14:12,894 --> 00:14:13,894
Close call.

199
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:16,139
Billy, what are you doing here?

200
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,309
Well, it occurred to me that...

201
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,019
I've never snuck through
your bedroom window.

202
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,692
Right, and now
that it's out of your system...

203
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,691
I was home watching television, and...

204
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:29,611
The exorcist was on.
Got me thinking of you.

205
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:32,162
It did?

206
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,703
Yeah. It was edited for TV.

207
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,782
You know, all the good stuff
was cut out and...

208
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,455
It got me thinking of us.

209
00:14:41,047 --> 00:14:43,663
How two years ago,
we started off hot and heavy.

210
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:48,092
Nice, solid r rating,
on our way to an no-17.

211
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,047
And how things have changed, and...

212
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,564
Lately, we're just
sort of edited for television.

213
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,026
So, you thought
you would climb in my window,

214
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:08,571
and we'd have a little raw footage?

215
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,570
No, no. I wouldn't dream
of breaking your underwear rule.

216
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:15,286
I just...

217
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,456
I thought maybe we could do
a little on top of the clothes stuff.

218
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:22,546
Okay.

219
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:25,424
Yeah”?

220
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:27,175
Yeah.

221
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:42,691
Hey.

222
00:15:57,999 --> 00:16:01,207
Okay. Okay, okay. Time's up, stud bucket.

223
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,160
You see what you do to me?

224
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,709
You know what my dad will do to you?

225
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,051
Yeah.

226
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,127
- I'm going.
- Okay.

227
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:19,269
Bye.

228
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,189
You know,
I appreciate the romantic gesture.

229
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,941
Hey, about the sex stuff?

230
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,815
You know,
I'm not trying to rush you at all.

231
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,741
I was only half-serious.

232
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,715
Hey, Billy.

233
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:53,046
Would you settle for a pg-13 relationship?

234
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:54,926
What's that?

235
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:04,679
My god. You're just a tease.

236
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,112
35-14... situation under control.

237
00:17:18,496 --> 00:17:20,407
Roger, dispatch. 35, I copy.

238
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:24,369
All right.

239
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,342
Are dealing drugs,
that they are high in the classrooms,

240
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:44,392
and that they are involved in the occult.

241
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
Occult?

242
00:17:46,816 --> 00:17:50,274
The small town of woodsboro, California
was devastated last night

243
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:53,148
when two young teenagers
were found brutally murdered.

244
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,731
Authorities have yet to issue a statement,
but our sources tell us

245
00:17:56,826 --> 00:17:59,506
that no arrest has been made,
and the murderer could strike again...

246
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,412
- Do you believe this shit?
- Tatum, what is going on?

247
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:03,829
- You don't know?
- No.

248
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:07,625
Casey Becker and Steve orth
were killed last night.

249
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,043
What? No way.

250
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,122
And we're not just talking killed,
we're talking splatter-movie killed,

251
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,377
ripped open from end to end.

252
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,959
Casey Becker?
She sits next to me in english.

253
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,169
Not anymore.

254
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,347
It's so sad. Her mom and dad
found her hanging from a tree,

255
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:22,719
her insides on the outside.

256
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,768
Oh, my god. Do they know who did it?

257
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,472
Fucking clueless. I mean,
they're interrogating the entire school,

258
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:30,898
teachers, students, janitors.

259
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:33,317
- They think it's school-related?
- They don't know.

260
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,942
Dewey was saying this is the worst crime
they've seen in years, even worse than...

261
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,326
Well...

262
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,154
It's bad.

263
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,507
- Here you go, Mrs. Taylor.
- Thank you, Jimmy.

264
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,381
Sidney?

265
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,083
It would appear to be your turn.

266
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,054
Who's up next?

267
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,347
- Sidney Prescott.
- Prescott.

268
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,058
She was daughter of...

269
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,139
- Sidney. Thank you.
- Okay.

270
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,313
Hi, Sidney.

271
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:14,976
Sheriff Burke. Dewey.

272
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,945
That's deputy Riley today, sid.

273
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,111
How is everything?

274
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:22,202
Good.

275
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,368
And your dad? How's he doing?

276
00:19:24,455 --> 00:19:26,286
We're fine, thanks.

277
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,285
We're gonna keep this very brief, Sidney.

278
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,083
The police just wanna ask you
a few questions. You okay?

279
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,375
Sidney, were you very close
to Casey Becker?

280
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:39,463
Remember, your principal loves you,
and I want you to be safe.

281
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:43,216
All students are encouraged to return fo
their homes promptly from school grounds.

282
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,138
Avoid strangers
and walk in twos and threes...

283
00:19:45,226 --> 00:19:48,466
- How many questions did they ask you, sid?
- Well, they asked me if I knew Casey.

284
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:51,375
- Yeah, they asked me that, too.
- Hey, did they ask if you like to hunt?

285
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:53,014
Yeah, they did. They ask you?

286
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:56,184
Hunt? Why would they ask you
if you like to hunt?

287
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:57,893
Because their bodies were gutted.

288
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,358
Thank you, Randy.

289
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,985
They didn't ask me if I liked to hunt.

290
00:20:02,076 --> 00:20:04,179
That's 'cause there's no way
a girl could've killed them.

291
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,203
That is so sexist.

292
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:07,824
The killer could easily be female.
Basic instinct?

293
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,247
That was an ice pick.
Not exactly the same thing.

294
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,871
Yeah, Casey and Steve
were completely hollowed out.

295
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,999
And the fact is, it takes a man
to do something like that.

296
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:17,455
Or a man's mentality.

297
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:20,007
How do you gut someone?

298
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,050
You take a knife...

299
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,758
And you slit them from groin to sternum.

300
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:31,515
Hey, it's called tact, you fuckrag.

301
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,646
Hey, stu, didn't you used to date Casey?

302
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:36,898
Yeah, for, like, two seconds.

303
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,897
Before she dumped him for Steve.

304
00:20:38,988 --> 00:20:41,570
- I thought you dumped her for me?
- I did. He's full of shit.

305
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:43,497
Are the police aware
that you dated the victim?

306
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,655
Hey, what are you saying?
That I killed her?

307
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,702
It would certainly improve
your high school "q."

308
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,405
Stu was with me last night. Okay?

309
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,615
Yeah, I was.

310
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,252
Was that before or after
he sliced and diced?

311
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,374
Fuck you, nutcase.
Where were you last night?

312
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,922
Working, thank you.

313
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:02,295
At the video store?
I thought they fired your sorry ass.

314
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:03,466
Twice.

315
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,595
I didn't kill anybody.

316
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,263
Nobody said you did.

317
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,018
Thanks, buddy.

318
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:15,138
Besides, it takes a man
to do something like that.

319
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,598
Yo, I'm gonna gut your ass
in a second, kid.

320
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,810
Tell me something, did you really put
her liver in the mailbox?

321
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:23,112
'Cause I heard that they found her liver
in the mailbox

322
00:21:23,199 --> 00:21:24,780
next to her spleen and her pancreas.

323
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:27,404
Randy, you goon-fuck,
I'm trying to eat here.

324
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,031
She's getting mad, Randy.

325
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,070
You better "liver" alone.

326
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,412
Liver alone!

327
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,264
See you, Sidney.

328
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:51,761
I'll talk to you tomorrow, sid.

329
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,618
So you sure I can stay over?
'Cause my dad won't be back till Sunday.

330
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,050
You okay?

331
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,882
It's just, you know,
the police and reporters and everything,

332
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,180
it's like deja vu all over again.

333
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:33,633
I'll be there by 7.00, I promise.

334
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,558
- Thanks, Tatum.
- I alter.

335
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:27,653
The bodies of 17-year-old Casey Becker
and her 18-year-old boyfriend Steven orth

336
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,776
were discovered late last night
by the girl's...

337
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,778
The woodsboro double-murder case.

338
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,611
Authorities are baffled
by the lack of clues and the savage...

339
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:38,448
The town's in shock, and no one
can quite believe what has happened here.

340
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:42,042
Although this is not the first ime
this small community of woodsboro

341
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,960
has endured such trageay.

342
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:46,960
Only a year ago, Maureen Prescott,
wife and mother,

343
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,794
was found raped and murdered
not far from this peaceful town square.

344
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,747
Hello?

345
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:04,871
Practice ran late. I'm on my way, okay?

346
00:25:07,548 --> 00:25:09,038
It's past 7:00.

347
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:11,749
Don't worry. Casey and Steve
didn't bite it till way after 10:00.

348
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,090
That's comforting.

349
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,886
I'm gonna swing by the video store.

350
00:25:16,974 --> 00:25:19,056
I was thinking Tom Cruise
in all the right moves.

351
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,850
You know, if you pause it just right,
you can see his penis.

352
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,768
Whatever. Just hurry, okay?

353
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,062
Ta-ta, sid.

354
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,407
Tatum, just get in the car...

355
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:38,609
Hello, Sidney.

356
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,994
Hi. Who is this?

357
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,199
You fell me.

358
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,371
Well, I have no idea.

359
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:52,127
Scary night, isn't it?

360
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:56,460
With the murders and all, it's like
right out of a horror movie or something.

361
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:59,505
Randy, you gave yourself away.

362
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,182
Are you calling from work?
'Cause Tatum's on her way over.

363
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,261
Do you like scary movies, Sidney?

364
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,516
I like that thing you're doing
with your voice, Randy.

365
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,893
It's sexy.

366
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,475
What's your favorite scary movie?

367
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,401
Oh, come on.
You know I don't watch that shit.

368
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,445
Why not? Too scared?

369
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,399
No. No. It's just, what's the point?
They're all the same.

370
00:26:18,494 --> 00:26:21,406
Some stupid killer stalking some
big-breasted girl who can't act,

371
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,807
who's always running up the stairs

372
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,191
when she should be going out
the front door. It's insulting.

373
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:28,459
Are you alone in the house?

374
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:31,378
Randy, that's so unoriginal.
I'm disappointed in you.

375
00:26:31,465 --> 00:26:34,628
Maybe that's because I'm not rana.

376
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,807
So, who are you?

377
00:26:43,894 --> 00:26:49,230
The question isnt, "who am I?"
The question is, "where am 1?"

378
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,396
So, where are you?

379
00:26:53,487 --> 00:26:55,227
Your front porch.

380
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,234
Why would you be calling
from my front porch?

381
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:04,240
That's the original part.

382
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,451
Oh, yeah?

383
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,961
Well, I call your bluff.

384
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,680
So where are you?

385
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,102
Right here.

386
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:03,470
Can you see me right now?

387
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,386
Okay. What am I doing?

388
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,604
What am I doing? Hello?

389
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:16,062
Nice try, Randy.

390
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:18,394
Tell Tatum to hurry up, okay? Bye, now.

391
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,150
If you hang up on me,
you'll die, just like your mother!

392
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,617
Do you want to die, Sidney?

393
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,945
Your mother sure didn't

394
00:28:29,291 --> 00:28:30,997
fuck you, you cretin.

395
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,153
Nol!

396
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:30,059
Come on.

397
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,222
Shit!

398
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,903
Billy!

399
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:53,159
Door's locked.
I heard screaming. You all right?

400
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,286
The killer's here. He's in the house.

401
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:58,119
No, he's in the house.
He's gonna... he's gonna kill us.

402
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,498
He's gone.

403
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,173
He's gone.

404
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:02,790
It's all right.

405
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:14,729
What?

406
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,859
Sid, what?

407
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:24,196
Wait, wait, wait!

408
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:26,146
Sidney, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

409
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,573
Come on! Sidney, come back!

410
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,359
Sidney!

411
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,578
Sorry. I found this.

412
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:39,751
Come on!

413
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,232
All right, hold your hands together!

414
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:43,417
Do you wish to give up
your right to remain silent?

415
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:44,623
I didn't do anything.

416
00:30:44,718 --> 00:30:46,959
Do you wish to give up
your right to speak to an attorney

417
00:30:47,054 --> 00:30:48,760
and have him present during questioning?

418
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,132
Ask her. She'll tell you.

419
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,927
- Ask her.
- What have you got, Dewey?

420
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:54,218
I caught him, sheriff. “Wait!

421
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,930
- Who is that?
- Billy loomis.

422
00:30:56,021 --> 00:30:59,229
Sir... sheriff, call these guys off.
I didn't do it.

423
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:03,726
Sheriff, wait, wait. Listen. Call my dad.

424
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,482
Please call him.
He'll tell you. Just call him.

425
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,531
Sidney! Sidney!

426
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,654
- How's she doing?
- Sid's tougher than she looks.

427
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,573
You'd have to be,
all the shit she's been through.

428
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,029
Sid!

429
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,824
Well, we're seeing a lot of you today.

430
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,623
You gonna be able to come to the station
and answer a few questions, sid?

431
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,045
Oh, shit. Sidney!

432
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,214
God, sid, I'm so sorry I was late.
Are you all right?

433
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,529
Tatum, you can't be here.
This is an official crime scene.

434
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:29,713
It's okay.

435
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:32,342
Her dad's out of town, all right?
She's staying with us tonight.

436
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,340
- Does mom know?
- Yes, doofus.

437
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,551
- Let's get you out of here.
- She'll be okay.

438
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:40,432
- Come on, sid.
- You won't believe this.

439
00:31:40,524 --> 00:31:41,559
What?

440
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:45,768
Creepy, huh?

441
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,445
I'll be damned. “What?

442
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,246
Jesus, the camera! Hurry!

443
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,869
My name isn't Jesus.

444
00:32:02,254 --> 00:32:03,790
Sidney, is that you in there?

445
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,840
Excuse me, is that Sidney Prescott
they took away?

446
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,084
I'm not talking to you.

447
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:09,257
- What happened to her?
- None of your damn business.

448
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:11,801
I heard something about a costume.
Is that true?

449
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:13,594
Can you tell me anything?

450
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:17,095
Yeah, you're a real pain in the ass.
Leave sid alone.

451
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:19,260
Where's she going?

452
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,722
Look... Kenny? Yeah?

453
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:26,433
I know that you're about
50 pounds overweight,

454
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:28,234
but when I say hurry,

455
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:32,860
please interpret that as
move your fat, tub-of-lard ass now!

456
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:37,618
Did you find him?

457
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,455
You're sure it was the Hilton?

458
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:42,157
At the airport.

459
00:32:44,296 --> 00:32:45,627
He's not registered there.

460
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,122
Could he have stayed somewhere else?

461
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,254
I don't know. I guess.

462
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,556
Don't worry, sid.

463
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:57,381
We'll find him.

464
00:32:57,476 --> 00:32:58,841
Dewey, they got that mask in.

465
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:02,181
- Roger, dispatch.
- I'll be right back.

466
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,020
Let me ask you this,

467
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,401
what are you doing
with a cellular telephone, son?

468
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,946
Everybody's got one, sheriff.

469
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,987
I didn't make those calls. I swear.

470
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:23,121
Why don't you check the phone bill,
for Christ's sake. Call vital phone comp.

471
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:26,543
- They got records of every number dialed.
- Thanks, Hank. We're on top of it.

472
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:30,296
What were you doing over
at Sidney's house tonight?

473
00:33:31,218 --> 00:33:32,879
I wanted to see her, that's all.

474
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:36,712
And last night? Sidney said you crawled
through her window last night, too.

475
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,137
You went out last night?

476
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,761
I was watching TV. I got bored.
I decided to go for a ride.

477
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:45,641
You happen to ride by
Casey Becker's house?

478
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,474
No. No, I didn't.

479
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,775
Sheriff, I didn't kill anybody.

480
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:59,200
We're gonna have to hold you, son,
till we get those phone records.

481
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,663
This is crazy.

482
00:34:05,335 --> 00:34:07,747
You know that? I didn't do it.

483
00:34:19,224 --> 00:34:20,555
- Camera two!
- No, I do!

484
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,722
Okay! Yeah.

485
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,425
Are there any more donuts in there?

486
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,393
Move it, Kenny.

487
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,846
- They're not letting anybody in.
- I'm not just anyone.

488
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:29,608
Bitch goddess.

489
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,354
- Kenny, are we on?
- Yeah, go.

490
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,277
Hi. Gale weathers reporting live
from the woodsboro police station,

491
00:34:34,364 --> 00:34:36,605
where we hope to get a glimpse
of Sidney Prescott.

492
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,780
Hey, watch her, Larry!

493
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,199
Hey, watch the hand.
You know who you're dealing with here?

494
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:43,279
Tell them. Come on, dad. Tell them.

495
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,673
- Sidney...
- Just wait for the lawyer, Billy.

496
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,991
- Sidney, come on. You know me.
- Come on, come on.

497
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,247
- Sidney, look at me!
- Don't give us any trouble.

498
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:51,922
Come on!

499
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:01,422
Sid, I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?
You okay?

500
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:06,935
They sell this costume
in every five-and-dime in the state.

501
00:35:07,022 --> 00:35:09,058
There's no way to track the purchase.

502
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,019
What about that cellular phone bill?

503
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,192
Well, we're pulling loomis's account.

504
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,270
We won't know anything until the morning.

505
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,444
Oh, come on!

506
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,444
You think he did it?

507
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,527
Twenty years ago,
I would've said not a chance.

508
00:35:23,622 --> 00:35:25,362
But these kids today...

509
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,996
Damned if I know.

510
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,824
Hey, Dewey, can we go now?

511
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,284
Hold on a second.

512
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,040
Goddamn it, Dewey!

513
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,004
What did mom tell you?

514
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:37,423
When I wear this badge,
you treat me like a man of the law.

515
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:41,219
I'm sorry, deputy Dewey boy,
but we're ready to go. Now, okay?

516
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,715
Take them out the back way.
Avoid that circus out there.

517
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:47,551
Go on, big brother.

518
00:35:47,646 --> 00:35:49,227
- Come on.
- Don't touch me.

519
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,138
He's my superior.

520
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,972
The janitor's your superior.

521
00:35:56,071 --> 00:35:57,607
Let's get back to work!

522
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,781
Isn't there a back way out of this place?

523
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,783
Yeah. Down that alley, I think.

524
00:36:12,212 --> 00:36:14,123
You guys just stay here.
I'm gonna get the car.

525
00:36:14,214 --> 00:36:15,704
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

526
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,212
There she is. Sidney!

527
00:36:21,554 --> 00:36:24,466
Hi. Some night. What happened?
Are you all right?

528
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:26,593
She's not answering any questions.
Leave us alone.

529
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:29,427
No. No, Tatum. It's okay.
She's just doing her job, right, Gale?

530
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:31,136
Yes, that's right.

531
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,940
So how's the book?

532
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:34,981
Well, it'll be out later this year.

533
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,354
I'll look for it.

534
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,981
I'll send you a copy.

535
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,157
Geez.

536
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,153
- Nice shot.
- Bitch.

537
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:48,362
- No, I mean, the camera. Nice shot.
- Where'd you learn to punch like that?

538
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:53,162
God, I loved it. "I'll send you a copy."
Bam! Bitch went down.

539
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:59,339
"I'll send you a copy." Bam!
Sid, superbitch! You are so cool.

540
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:01,542
Thought you might want some ice
for that right hook.

541
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,595
Thanks.

542
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:07,510
I'll be right next door.
Try to get some sleep.

543
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:08,715
Yeah, yeah.

544
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,602
Do you really think Billy did it?

545
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,354
He was there, Tatum.

546
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,447
He was destined to have a flaw.
I knew he was too perfect.

547
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:27,911
Telephone, honey.

548
00:37:27,996 --> 00:37:29,702
- Who is it?
- It's for sid.

549
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:30,789
My dad?

550
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,830
I don't think so.

551
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,624
- Take a message.
- No. I'll get it.

552
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,172
How's she doing?

553
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,089
Hello?

554
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,217
Hello, Sidney.

555
00:37:49,559 --> 00:37:50,674
Nol!

556
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,805
Poor Billy boyfriend.

557
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:55,478
An innocent guy
doesn't stand a chance with you.

558
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,805
Leave me alone!

559
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,061
Looks like you fingered the wrong guy...

560
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,267
- Dewey!
- Again.

561
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:01,726
- Who are you?
- Dewey!

562
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:05,564
- Hang up, sid.
- Don't worry. You'll find out soon enough.

563
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,239
- I promise.
- Dewey!

564
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:11,240
What?

565
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,831
"What?" “what?

566
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:22,800
Hello?

567
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,846
Sidney Prescott, who escaped
a vicious attack last night,

568
00:38:37,941 --> 00:38:41,479
is the daughter of Maureen Prescott,
who was brutally killed last year

569
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:44,402
when convicted murderer cotfon weary
broke info their home

570
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,821
and savagely raped and tortured
lhe deceased.

571
00:38:47,534 --> 00:38:50,901
Coffton weary is currently awaiting appeal
for the death sentence handed down

572
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,611
after the young Sidney
testified against him.

573
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,322
She was the key witness
in the state's case against the...

574
00:38:59,045 --> 00:39:01,206
It's never gonna stop, is it?

575
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,000
Billy was released.

576
00:39:05,218 --> 00:39:08,631
His cellular bill was clean.
He didn't make those calls.

577
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,508
We're checking every cellular account
in the county.

578
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:15,091
Any calls made to you or Casey Becker
are being cross-referenced.

579
00:39:15,812 --> 00:39:18,394
It's gonna take some time,
but we'll find him.

580
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,191
Okay?

581
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,245
Don't worry, sid. It's school.
You'll be safe here.

582
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,998
How does it feel
to be almost brutally butchered?

583
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,420
Hey! Hey, now, leave her alone.

584
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,372
People want to know!
They have a right to know!

585
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,128
- Leave her alone.
- How does it feel?

586
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,006
She just wants to get an education.
Turn that thing off.

587
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:53,929
What?

588
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,227
Just a sec.

589
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,521
Stop right there.

590
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,902
I'm not here to fight.
I just need to talk.

591
00:40:11,993 --> 00:40:13,779
Kenny, camera, now.

592
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,610
- Off the record. No cameras.
- Forget it.

593
00:40:15,705 --> 00:40:17,741
Please? You owe me.

594
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,038
I owe you shit.

595
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,285
You owe my mother!

596
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:26,041
Your mother's murder
was last year's hottest court case.

597
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,772
Somebody was gonna write a book about it.

598
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,237
Right. It had to be you
with your lies and bullshit theories.

599
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,048
What is your problem?
You got what you wanted.

600
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:35,676
Cotton weary's in jail.
They're gonna gas him.

601
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:37,348
A book is not gonna change that.

602
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:43,959
- Do you still think he's innocent?
- Your testimony put him away.

603
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,503
It doesn't really matter what I think.

604
00:40:46,069 --> 00:40:49,527
During the trial, you did all those
stories about me. You called me a liar.

605
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,775
I think you falsely identified him, yes.

606
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:54,949
- Have you talked to cotton?
- Many times.

607
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,486
- And has his story changed?
- Not one word.

608
00:40:59,332 --> 00:41:02,039
He admits to having sex with your mother,
but that's all.

609
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,617
He's lying.
She never would've touched him.

610
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,498
He raped her, and then...

611
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,797
He butchered her.
Her blood was all over his coat.

612
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,169
He was drunk that night.

613
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:14,590
He left his coat at your house
after your mother seduced him.

614
00:41:14,681 --> 00:41:16,171
I saw him leave wearing it.

615
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,847
No, you saw someone leave
wearing that coat,

616
00:41:19,686 --> 00:41:23,224
the same someone who planted it
in cotton's car, framing him.

617
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,650
No.

618
00:41:27,527 --> 00:41:29,063
Cotton murdered my mother.

619
00:41:31,823 --> 00:41:33,484
You're not so sure anymore, are you?

620
00:41:35,243 --> 00:41:38,155
Nice welt, sweetie. Let's go, sid.

621
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:40,820
The killer's still on the loose, isn't he?

622
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,950
Come on, sid.

623
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,326
Those murders are related.

624
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:46,200
I'm sorry I mangled your face.

625
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,455
Wait. Sidney, don't go.

626
00:41:47,547 --> 00:41:49,378
Just stop, all right?

627
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,836
Jesus Christ.

628
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:59,889
An innocent man on death row.
A killer still on the loose.

629
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,096
Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming.

630
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,945
- You want to go live?
- No, no. Not so fast.

631
00:42:03,021 --> 00:42:06,263
- We don't have anything concrete.
- This is huge. You can't just sit on it.

632
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,894
I know. That's why we need proof.

633
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:12,477
If I'm right about this,
I could save a man's life.

634
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,612
Do you know what that
could do for my book sales?

635
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,533
This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here.

636
00:42:20,747 --> 00:42:22,988
I want you to meet me
right here after class. Okay, sid?

637
00:42:24,292 --> 00:42:25,327
All right.

638
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:31,003
Hey, I haven't seen Billy around.
Is he really pissed?

639
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:33,456
You mean after you branded him
the candy man?

640
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,257
No. His heart's broken. =stu!

641
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,347
Why are they doing this?

642
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,057
Are you kidding me?
Look at this place. It's like Christmas.

643
00:42:50,151 --> 00:42:52,858
- Stupidity leak!
- Easy!

644
00:42:52,945 --> 00:42:54,025
Sidney!

645
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:57,397
Jesus! Shit!

646
00:42:58,326 --> 00:42:59,406
It's just me.

647
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,237
You still think it's me.

648
00:43:04,332 --> 00:43:06,744
No. No, I don't.

649
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,621
It's just... somebody was there...

650
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:10,827
Hey, christie, wait up.

651
00:43:10,922 --> 00:43:12,332
Billy, someone tried to kill me.

652
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,789
I know. I know.
The cops said I scared them away.

653
00:43:14,884 --> 00:43:16,340
It wasn't me, sid.

654
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:20,795
I know. He called me again last night
at Tatum's house.

655
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:24,633
You see? Couldn't have been me.
I was in jail. Remember?

656
00:43:27,647 --> 00:43:30,559
I'm so... sorry. Please understand.

657
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,481
Understand what?

658
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,268
That I have a girlfriend
who would rather accuse me

659
00:43:35,363 --> 00:43:37,900
of being a psychopathic killer
than touch me?

660
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,107
You know that's not true.

661
00:43:41,202 --> 00:43:42,237
Then what is it?

662
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,319
What... is it?

663
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,825
Billy, I was attacked
and nearly filleted last night.

664
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,122
I mean between us.

665
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,908
I mean, you haven't been the same since...

666
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,756
Since your mother died.

667
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:58,550
Is your brain leaking? My mom was killed.
I can't believe you're bringing this up!

668
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,967
No, it's been a year.

669
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,295
Tomorrow. One year tomorrow.

670
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,346
I know. I think it's time
you got over that.

671
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,345
I mean, when my mom left my dad,
I accepted it.

672
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:10,178
It's the way it is. She's not coming back.

673
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:13,436
Your parents split up.
This is not the same thing.

674
00:44:13,526 --> 00:44:15,892
Your mom left town.
She's not lying in a coffin somewhere.

675
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:19,479
Okay. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.
It's... it's a bad analogy.

676
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:21,818
It's just that...

677
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,908
I want my girlfriend back.

678
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,114
Sid!

679
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,073
I am sorry if my traumatized life

680
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:34,127
is an inconvenience to you
and your perfect existence.

681
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:37,376
What? What are you...
Nobody said that! Sid!

682
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,042
Stupid.

683
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:43,378
You make me so sick.

684
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:47,932
Your entire havoc-inducing, thieving,
whoring generation disgusts me.

685
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:54,605
So, two of your fellow students
were just savagely murdered,

686
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,462
and this is the way that you show
your compassion and sensitivity, huh?

687
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,851
Let me tell you something...

688
00:44:59,864 --> 00:45:01,320
You're both expelled. Get out!

689
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,366
- Come on, Mr. himbry! It was just a joke!
- That's not fair!

690
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:12,490
You're absolutely right. It is not fair.

691
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:17,124
Fairness would be to rip your insides out,
hang you from a tree so we can expose you

692
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,173
for the heartless,
desensitized little shits that you are.

693
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,179
She was never attacked.
I think she made it all up.

694
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,514
Why would she lie about it?

695
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,225
For attention.
The girl has some serious issues.

696
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,075
What if she did it?

697
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:50,448
What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve?

698
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,279
And why would she do that?

699
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:55,913
Maybe she had the hots for Steve
and killed them both in a jealous rage.

700
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:58,119
What would Sidney want with Steve?

701
00:45:58,214 --> 00:46:00,830
She has her own
bubble-butt boyfriend Billy.

702
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,296
Maybe she's a slut just like her mother.

703
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:07,925
- You're evil.
- Please. It's a common fact.

704
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,425
Her mother was a tramp.

705
00:46:09,517 --> 00:46:11,508
Cut some slack.
She watched her mom get butchered.

706
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:13,968
Yeah, and it fucked her up royally.
Think about it.

707
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:16,645
Her mother's death
leaves her disturbed and hostile

708
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,064
in a cruel and inhumane world.

709
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:23,269
She's delusional. "Where's god?"
Et cetera. Completely suicidal.

710
00:46:23,364 --> 00:46:26,322
One day, she snaps.
She wants to kill herself,

711
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:29,572
but she realizes that teen suicide
is out this year,

712
00:46:29,662 --> 00:46:33,655
and homicide is a much healthier,
therapeutic expression.

713
00:46:33,749 --> 00:46:35,580
Where do you get this shit?

714
00:46:35,668 --> 00:46:36,668
Ricki lake.

715
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,368
You are pathetic!

716
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,008
"Pathetic."

717
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,846
Sianey.

718
00:47:22,757 --> 00:47:24,497
Sianey.

719
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,049
Is someone there?

720
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,004
In what appears to be a prank,

721
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:15,556
several students were seen
wearing scary masks.

722
00:48:15,643 --> 00:48:17,383
School officials have yet to comment,

723
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:21,596
but this is known to be the same costume
worn by the killer.

724
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,432
Seventeen-year-old Casey Becker
and her boyfriend Steven orth

725
00:48:24,527 --> 00:48:27,519
have already lost their lives. Who's next?

726
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:31,572
You can literally feel
the fear on this campus.

727
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,992
Hi. Gale weathers,
field correspondent, top story.

728
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:38,321
I know who you are, miss weathers.
How's the eye?

729
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:41,032
It's productive.
Is there a problem on campus?

730
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:43,243
No. Everything's under control.

731
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:44,827
Well, of course. You're here.

732
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,749
You're not supposed to be here.

733
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,548
I know. I should be in New York
covering the Sharon stone stalker,

734
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:50,966
but who knew?

735
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,420
You look awfully young
to be a police officer.

736
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,097
I'm 25 years old.

737
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,674
You know, in a demographic study,

738
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,977
I proved to be most popular
amongst males 11 to 24.

739
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:03,815
Guess I just missed you.

740
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:07,100
Of course, you don't look a day over 12,

741
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,981
except in that upper-torso area.

742
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,438
- Does the force require you to work out?
- No, ma'am.

743
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,232
'Cause of my boyish good looks,

744
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,785
muscle mass has increased my acceptance
as a serious police officer.

745
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,493
I need your attention now, kids.

746
00:49:21,584 --> 00:49:23,620
Due fo the recent events
that have occurred,

747
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:27,704
effective immediately, all classes
are suspended until further notice.

748
00:49:29,008 --> 00:49:32,421
The woodsboro police department
has issued a citywide curfew

749
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:35,253
beginning at nine o'clock fonight.

750
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:38,256
Looks like we've got
a serial killer on our hands.

751
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,591
Well, a serial killer
is not really accurate.

752
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,098
Gotta knock off a couple more
to get that title.

753
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:44,599
Well, we can help, can't we?

754
00:49:46,317 --> 00:49:48,558
I mean, we certainly don't have any leads.

755
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,608
Have you located Sidney's father yet?

756
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,569
No, not yet.

757
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,237
Well, he's not a suspect, is he?

758
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:56,691
We haven't ruled him out as a possibility.

759
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,779
- If you'll excuse me.
- I'm sorry. Am I keeping you?

760
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,410
If I may say so, miss weathers...

761
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,534
You are much prettier in person.

762
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:11,209
So you do watch the show.

763
00:50:13,093 --> 00:50:16,927
I'm 25. I was 24 for a whole year.

764
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,013
Please, call me Gale.

765
00:50:21,435 --> 00:50:23,767
It was just some sick fuck
having a laugh, Sidney.

766
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,095
No, it was him, Tatum. I know it.

767
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:30,274
You're not to be alone anymore, right?
If you pee, I pee. Is that clear?

768
00:50:30,361 --> 00:50:32,773
Kizool, 'cause schizzool is izzout.

769
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:35,900
I don't know what you did, Sidney,
but on behalf of the entire student body,

770
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,277
- we all say thank you!
- Stop it, St...

771
00:50:38,369 --> 00:50:42,362
No, I say impromptu party tonight,
my house,

772
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,412
to celebrate this little siesta.
What do you say?

773
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:45,615
Are you serious?

774
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:47,700
Parents are out of town,

775
00:50:47,795 --> 00:50:50,912
and if this little ViXen doesn't invite
the entire world, we'll be fine.

776
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,247
Intimate gathering, intimate friends.

777
00:50:53,342 --> 00:50:56,960
What do you say, sid?
I mean, pathos could have its perks.

778
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:59,591
Totally protected. Yo, I am so buff.

779
00:50:59,682 --> 00:51:01,593
- I got you covered, girl.
- No...

780
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:04,012
Come on, sid.

781
00:51:04,103 --> 00:51:05,809
For me? It could be fun.

782
00:51:07,439 --> 00:51:08,804
Okay, whatever.

783
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,514
Yeah? Nice.

784
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,766
Cool. You guys bring food, all right?

785
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:32,206
Yes?

786
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:34,292
Hello?

787
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:51,608
Damn it.

788
00:52:10,044 --> 00:52:12,126
- Damn little shits.
- What'd you call me?

789
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,583
- Not you, Fred.
- Prick.

790
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:31,034
What if cotton weary is telling the truth?

791
00:53:31,125 --> 00:53:34,617
Maybe he was having an affair
with your mom.

792
00:53:34,712 --> 00:53:37,203
I mean, your dad was always
out of town on business. Maybe...

793
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,916
Maybe your mom
was just a very unhappy woman.

794
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,841
If they were having an affair,

795
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:46,011
then how come
cotton couldn't prove it in court?

796
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,887
Well, you can't prove a rumor.
That's why it's a rumor.

797
00:53:50,978 --> 00:53:55,017
Right, created by
that little tabloid twit Gale weathers.

798
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:58,398
It goes further back, sid.

799
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,943
There's been talk about other men.

800
00:54:02,531 --> 00:54:03,646
And you believe it?

801
00:54:05,117 --> 00:54:06,117
Well...

802
00:54:07,286 --> 00:54:09,493
I mean, you can only hear
that Richard Gere gerbil story

803
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:12,538
so many times
before you have to start believing it.

804
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,290
I'm sorry.

805
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,750
You know, if I was wrong
about cotton weary,

806
00:54:24,845 --> 00:54:27,211
then the killer's still out there.

807
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:28,386
Don't go there, sid.

808
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,432
You're starting to sound like
some Wes carpenter flick or something.

809
00:54:31,518 --> 00:54:34,260
Don't freak yourself out, okay?
We've got a long night ahead of us.

810
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:36,189
Okay?

811
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:38,851
Let's boogie.

812
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:44,978
['S alive!

813
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:47,481
In the name of god!

814
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:54,287
- Watch it, jerk.
- I'm sorry.

815
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:00,004
Dork.

816
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,751
Jesus, this place is packed tonight, man.

817
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:06,212
We had a run in the mass murder section.

818
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,713
Coming to my fiesta?

819
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:10,592
- Yeah, I'm off early. Curfew, you know?
- Cool.

820
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:13,264
What's that werewolf movie
with et's mom in it?

821
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,967
The howling. Horror, straight ahead.

822
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,393
Okay, thanks.

823
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:20,229
Oh, now, that's in poor taste.

824
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:21,602
What?

825
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:25,026
If you were the only suspect
in a senseless bloodbath,

826
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,772
would you being standing
in the horror section?

827
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,774
Well, it was just a misunderstanding.

828
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:32,571
He didn't do anything.

829
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:34,528
You're such a little lap dog.

830
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,739
He's got "killer"
printed all over his forehead.

831
00:55:36,834 --> 00:55:39,496
Okay, really?

832
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,872
Why'd the cops let him go, smart guy?

833
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:44,000
Because obviously
they don't watch enough movies.

834
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,047
This is standard horror movie stuff.

835
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:47,670
Prom night revisited, man.

836
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,753
Yeah? Why would he want to kill
his own girlfriend?

837
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:53,885
There's always some stupid bullshit reason
to kill your girlfriend.

838
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:57,097
That's the beauty of it all. Simplicity.

839
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:01,263
Besides, if it gets too complicated,
you'll lose your target audience.

840
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,394
Well, what's his reason?

841
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,938
Maybe Sidney wouldn't have sex with him.

842
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:08,945
What, is she saving herself for you?

843
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:11,023
Maybe. Now that Billy
tried to mutilate her...

844
00:56:11,994 --> 00:56:13,780
Do you think sid would go out with me?

845
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:22,125
No, I don't, at all. No.

846
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:23,713
Know who I think it is?

847
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,335
You know, I think it's her father.

848
00:56:28,343 --> 00:56:30,550
Why can't they find her pops, man?

849
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:32,923
Because he's probably dead.

850
00:56:33,849 --> 00:56:36,556
His body will come popping up
in the last reel somewhere,

851
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:39,851
eyes gouged out, fingers cut off,
teeth knocked out!

852
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,979
See, the police are always
off track with this shit.

853
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,057
If they watched prom night,
they'd save time.

854
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:48,360
There's a formula to it,
a very simple formula!

855
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,903
Everybody's a suspect!

856
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,036
I'm telling you, the dad's a red herring.
It's Billy.

857
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:01,914
How do we know you're not the killer?

858
00:57:04,755 --> 00:57:05,755
Hi, Billy.

859
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,080
Maybe your movie-freaked mind
lost its reality button.

860
00:57:08,175 --> 00:57:09,175
Ever think of that?

861
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:11,466
You're absolutely right.
I'm the first to admit it.

862
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:14,010
If this were a scary movie,
I'd be the prime suspect.

863
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,097
That's right.

864
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,968
And what would be your motive?

865
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,095
It's the millennium.

866
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,931
Motives are incidental.

867
00:57:22,022 --> 00:57:23,102
Millennium?

868
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,556
Millennium, I like that.

869
00:57:25,651 --> 00:57:28,358
That's good. "It's the millennium."

870
00:57:29,571 --> 00:57:30,651
Good kid.

871
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,073
"Millennium." good word, my man.

872
00:57:35,744 --> 00:57:37,700
Now, you're telling me
that's not a killer?

873
00:58:22,666 --> 00:58:23,826
Sure is quiet.

874
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:29,169
God, look at this place.
It's the town that dreaded sundown.

875
00:58:29,256 --> 00:58:32,293
Yeah, I saw that movie.
It's about a killer in Texas, huh?

876
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,467
Hey, sid, just think,
if they make a movie about you,

877
00:58:35,554 --> 00:58:36,839
who's gonna play you?

878
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:38,670
I shudder to think.

879
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,006
I see you as a young Meg Ryan, myself.

880
00:58:41,101 --> 00:58:43,513
Thanks, Dewey. With my luck,
they'd cast Tori spelling.

881
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,391
I'm just gonna be a few minutes.

882
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,139
You girls don't go too far.

883
00:58:52,029 --> 00:58:53,519
Is Billy gonna be there tonight?

884
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,571
He better not be.
I told stu to keep his mouth shut.

885
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,240
I think we can live without
the endorphin rush for one night.

886
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,989
Billy's right, you know. Whenever
he touches me, I just can't relax.

887
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,871
So you have a few intimacy issues as
a result of your mother's untimely death.

888
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,248
It's no big deal, sid. You'll thaw out.

889
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:14,797
Yeah, but he has been so patient with me,
you know, with all this sex stuff.

890
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,565
How many guys will put up
with a girlfriend who's sexually anorexic?

891
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,966
Billy and his penis
don't deserve you, all right?

892
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:32,148
Dewey, where the hell you been?

893
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,021
I was keeping an eye on Sidney.

894
00:59:36,448 --> 00:59:37,563
Thought you quit.

895
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:40,027
I did, but damn it...

896
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:44,368
Dewey, vital phone just faxed us.

897
00:59:45,165 --> 00:59:48,908
Those calls are listed to Neil Prescott,
Sidney's father.

898
00:59:49,503 --> 00:59:52,290
He made the calls with a cellular phone.
It's been confirmed.

899
00:59:53,882 --> 00:59:56,123
Well, there's no way his cellular
could've been cloned?

900
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,217
There's more. Guess what tomorrow is?

901
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,178
The anniversary of his wife's death.

902
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,969
We'll keep the roadblocks and the curfew
in effect through the night.

903
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,770
If he's not picked up by morning,
then we'll do a house-to-house.

904
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,734
Where's Sidney?

905
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,355
She's with my sister.
You want me to bring her in?

906
01:00:18,156 --> 01:00:23,025
Not just yet. Let's find neill first,
make sure he's our man.

907
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,498
You stay close to Sidney.

908
01:00:34,089 --> 01:00:35,670
Don't let her out of your sight.

909
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:36,837
Yes, sir.

910
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,667
All right. You girls have fun.

911
01:01:15,547 --> 01:01:17,458
Not too much fun, or I'll bust ya.

912
01:01:19,718 --> 01:01:21,174
- Bye.
- Bye, sid.

913
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,851
We are here.

914
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,398
Yeah!

915
01:01:39,321 --> 01:01:40,777
Oh, that's superb.

916
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:43,321
You guys are tardy for the party
so we started without you.

917
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,148
My man! Yeah!

918
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:05,961
Well, were we spotted?

919
01:02:06,056 --> 01:02:08,547
I don't think so. Now get the camera.

920
01:02:08,642 --> 01:02:09,848
Ma'am...

921
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,462
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

922
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:14,428
Deputy, that's okay.

923
01:02:15,232 --> 01:02:16,688
What brings you to these parts?

924
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:20,893
Well, you just never know
when or where a story will break.

925
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:25,029
Not much of a story here.
Just a bunch of kids cutting it loose.

926
01:02:26,159 --> 01:02:27,820
Then what are you doing here?

927
01:02:30,497 --> 01:02:31,953
Just keeping an eye on things.

928
01:02:32,874 --> 01:02:34,159
I'm gonna check the party out.

929
01:02:36,044 --> 01:02:37,284
Do you mind if I join you?

930
01:02:38,338 --> 01:02:39,373
Not at all.

931
01:02:40,507 --> 01:02:41,872
Let me just get my coat.

932
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,015
All right.

933
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,431
Yeah, I'm fine.

934
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:53,846
Oh, yeah.

935
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:57,471
How many evil dead?

936
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:00,224
- Yeah!
- How many hellraiser?

937
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:01,854
Hellraiserright here.

938
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:04,937
The fog, terror train, prom night.

939
01:03:05,031 --> 01:03:07,738
How come Jamie Lee Curtis
is in all of these movies?

940
01:03:08,368 --> 01:03:10,984
She's the... scream queen.

941
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,195
I mean, with a set of lungs like that,
she should be.

942
01:03:13,290 --> 01:03:14,290
Yeah.

943
01:03:14,374 --> 01:03:15,910
Tits. See?

944
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,751
I'll get it.

945
01:03:20,297 --> 01:03:22,253
Hey, Tate, grab me another beer,
would you?

946
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:24,001
There's beer in the garage.

947
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,707
What am I, the beer wench?

948
01:03:25,802 --> 01:03:27,087
She was nominated.

949
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:30,825
- She was nominated for terror train.
- You are not gonna believe who's here.

950
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,089
It's that chick from 7op story.

951
01:03:32,183 --> 01:03:33,263
- Gale weathers?
- Here.

952
01:03:36,313 --> 01:03:37,928
You're underage, son.

953
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:41,181
I'm kidding. Have a good time.
Watch the driving.

954
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,103
- Dewey?
- Hi.

955
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:44,820
Dewey?

956
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,984
What is she doing here?

957
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:49,405
She's with me.

958
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,107
I'm just checking things out.

959
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:55,491
So you did. Now leave.
And take your media muff with you.

960
01:03:57,834 --> 01:04:00,416
- I just think you're awesome.
- Thank you very much.

961
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:02,585
- I watch your show religiously.
- That's great.

962
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,253
=

963
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:06,251
I'm getting a camera.

964
01:04:08,178 --> 01:04:11,045
- Have you found my father?
- I'm afraid not.

965
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,305
Should I be worried?

966
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,392
Not yet.

967
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,069
Jesus!

968
01:05:10,323 --> 01:05:12,029
Tatum, it's okay.

969
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:23,127
Shit.

970
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:29,665
Hey, shitheads!

971
01:05:31,886 --> 01:05:32,966
Hello?

972
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:36,842
Shit. Piss.

973
01:05:55,869 --> 01:05:56,904
Is that you, Randy?

974
01:05:59,497 --> 01:06:02,910
Cute. And what movie is this from?
I spit on your garage?

975
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:06,542
Lose the outfit.
If Sidney sees it, she'll flip.

976
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,579
You wanna play psycho killer?

977
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:12,506
Can I be the helpless victim?

978
01:06:13,553 --> 01:06:17,387
Okay, let's see.
No, please don't kill me, Mr. ghostface.

979
01:06:17,474 --> 01:06:18,930
I want to be in the sequel.

980
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:23,889
Cut, Casper. That's a wrap.

981
01:06:26,608 --> 01:06:28,223
Randy, what the hell are you doing?

982
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,558
Don't... what?

983
01:06:32,864 --> 01:06:33,864
Stop!

984
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,787
Fucker!

985
01:07:26,626 --> 01:07:28,412
No! No!

986
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,384
Happy curfew.

987
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:47,719
Nice party, St...

988
01:07:48,273 --> 01:07:49,433
Tatum, come on!

989
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:51,230
Nobody here but us chickens!

990
01:07:51,317 --> 01:07:53,397
- Do you know where she is?
- No, I haven't seen her.

991
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:58,692
Billy, hey.

992
01:07:58,783 --> 01:08:01,274
Billy. What are you doing here?

993
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:03,568
I was hoping I could talk to sid alone.

994
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,780
You know, if Tatum sees you here,
she'll draw blood.

995
01:08:06,874 --> 01:08:09,240
Tell you what, why don't you guys
go up to my parents' room?

996
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,996
You know, you guys can talk...

997
01:08:11,963 --> 01:08:13,328
Whatever.

998
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:15,793
"Subtlety," stu, you should look it up.

999
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,921
No, it's okay. We do need to talk.

1000
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:31,684
What's leatherface doing here?

1001
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:33,389
He came to make up.

1002
01:08:34,068 --> 01:08:36,400
There goes my chance with sid. Damn it.

1003
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:40,233
As if. That's all I'm saying. As if.

1004
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:42,649
Oh, really, Alicia?

1005
01:08:44,287 --> 01:08:45,572
As if.

1006
01:08:45,663 --> 01:08:47,119
I'm gonna go check on them.

1007
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:48,321
Come on!

1008
01:08:48,916 --> 01:08:50,781
Okay, everyone.
It was nice fo meet all of you.

1009
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:51,877
Thank you.

1010
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,710
You're a genius.

1011
01:08:56,174 --> 01:08:58,085
Oh, shit. “What?

1012
01:08:58,718 --> 01:09:01,004
- I got a delay.
- How long is it?

1013
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:04,132
I don't know. What'd it take you
to walk from the house, 30 seconds?

1014
01:09:04,223 --> 01:09:05,713
It'll be fine. Just record it.

1015
01:09:05,808 --> 01:09:07,639
- All right.
- The placement is perfect.

1016
01:09:08,311 --> 01:09:09,892
Tell me, Kenneth,

1017
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:12,971
has a cheesy tabloid journalist
ever won the pulitzer?

1018
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:15,022
First time for everything.

1019
01:09:15,693 --> 01:09:16,808
You're damn right.

1020
01:09:24,243 --> 01:09:25,278
So...

1021
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,539
So...

1022
01:09:33,044 --> 01:09:34,124
Look, I'm sorry.

1023
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:37,795
I've been selfish...

1024
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:40,168
And I want to apologize.

1025
01:09:40,259 --> 01:09:42,591
No. Billy, I'm...

1026
01:09:43,221 --> 01:09:47,055
The one who's been selfish
and self-absorbed

1027
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,473
with all this post-traumatic stress.

1028
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:51,853
You lost your mom.

1029
01:09:51,938 --> 01:09:53,769
Yeah, I know, but you're right.

1030
01:09:54,524 --> 01:10:00,611
Enough is enough. I can't wallow
in the grief process forever, and...

1031
01:10:04,075 --> 01:10:08,444
And I can't keep lying to myself
about who my mom was.

1032
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,371
Yeah, I think I'm really...

1033
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,040
Scared...

1034
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:22,840
That I'm gonna turn out just like her,
you know?

1035
01:10:24,929 --> 01:10:27,045
Like the bad seed or something.

1036
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:30,765
And I know it doesn't make sense.

1037
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,677
Yeah, it does.

1038
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:42,022
It's like Jodie foster
in silence of the lambs

1039
01:10:42,113 --> 01:10:45,856
when she keeps having flashbacks
of her dead father.

1040
01:10:45,950 --> 01:10:47,315
But this is life.

1041
01:10:48,411 --> 01:10:49,526
This isn't a movie.

1042
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,364
Sure it is, sid.

1043
01:10:52,707 --> 01:10:55,414
It's all... it's all a movie. It's all...

1044
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,242
One great big movie.

1045
01:11:05,136 --> 01:11:07,422
Only you can't pick your genre.

1046
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,326
Why can't I be a Meg Ryan movie?

1047
01:11:40,213 --> 01:11:41,953
Or even a good porno?

1048
01:11:46,385 --> 01:11:48,501
- What?
- You heard me.

1049
01:11:57,814 --> 01:11:59,020
Are you sure?

1050
01:12:01,192 --> 01:12:02,192
Yeah.

1051
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:04,604
I think so.

1052
01:12:21,754 --> 01:12:23,244
Look, look. Here it comes.

1053
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,673
Oh, man,
the color of the blood is all wrong.

1054
01:12:27,760 --> 01:12:30,297
Now why do they do that? It's too red!

1055
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:32,003
Wait, here comes another one.

1056
01:12:32,098 --> 01:12:33,838
Here, here...

1057
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,014
Yes! Yes!

1058
01:12:36,102 --> 01:12:38,309
Predictable. I knew he was gonna bite it.

1059
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:40,136
How can you watch this shit over and over?

1060
01:12:40,898 --> 01:12:43,435
When do we see breasts?
I want to see Jamie Lee's breasts.

1061
01:12:43,526 --> 01:12:45,482
When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts?
Yes. Yes!

1062
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:48,733
Breasts? Not until 7rading places in '83.

1063
01:12:48,823 --> 01:12:51,155
Jamie Lee was always the virgin
in horror movies.

1064
01:12:51,242 --> 01:12:53,699
She never showed her tits
till she went legits.

1065
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:55,447
Could afford a decent pair.

1066
01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:56,823
What'd you say?

1067
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,997
That's why she always outsmarted
the killer in the chase scene at the end.

1068
01:13:00,084 --> 01:13:02,370
Only virgins can do that.
Don't you know the rules?

1069
01:13:02,461 --> 01:13:03,746
What rules?

1070
01:13:03,838 --> 01:13:04,838
You don't...

1071
01:13:07,383 --> 01:13:09,624
Jesus Christ! You don't know the rules?

1072
01:13:09,719 --> 01:13:11,755
Have an aneurysm, why don't you?

1073
01:13:11,846 --> 01:13:14,553
There are certain rules
that one must abide by

1074
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,131
in order to successfully survive
a horror movie.

1075
01:13:17,226 --> 01:13:20,810
For instance, number one,
you can never have sex.

1076
01:13:21,689 --> 01:13:22,849
No! No!

1077
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,185
Big no-no! Big no-no!

1078
01:13:25,276 --> 01:13:27,062
I'd be a dead man.

1079
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:29,064
Sex equals death, okay?

1080
01:13:29,155 --> 01:13:32,238
Number two,
you can never drink or do drugs.

1081
01:13:35,161 --> 01:13:37,117
No, the sin factor.

1082
01:13:37,204 --> 01:13:39,490
This is sin.
It's an extension of number one.

1083
01:13:39,582 --> 01:13:43,825
And number three, never, ever, ever,
under any circumstances, say,

1084
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,831
"I'll be right back,"
'cause you won't be back.

1085
01:13:45,922 --> 01:13:47,753
I'm getting another beer. You want one?

1086
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,172
- Yeah, sure.
- I'll be right back!

1087
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:55,677
You see, you push the laws,
and you end up dead, okay?

1088
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,405
I'll see you in the kitchen with a knife.

1089
01:13:57,475 --> 01:14:00,763
Only virgins can outsmart the killer
in the big chase scene at the end.

1090
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:02,218
Don't you know the rules?

1091
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,975
- What rules?
- You don't know the rules?

1092
01:14:05,066 --> 01:14:08,479
There are certain rules that one must abide
by in order fo successfully survive...

1093
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:09,569
Boring.

1094
01:14:13,699 --> 01:14:14,984
The sheriff just radioed.

1095
01:14:15,076 --> 01:14:17,192
Somebody reported a car in the bushes
down the road.

1096
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:19,777
I'm gonna go check it out.
You care to join me?

1097
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:21,696
I'd love to.

1098
01:14:22,291 --> 01:14:23,872
If you're sure it's all right.

1099
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:27,459
Ma'am, I'm the deputy of this town.

1100
01:14:29,966 --> 01:14:31,206
Be right back.

1101
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:37,678
You see, you push the laws
and you end up dead, okay?

1102
01:14:37,765 --> 01:14:38,800
Excuse me, ma'am.

1103
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:41,803
I thought maybe we'd walk.

1104
01:14:43,646 --> 01:14:45,261
It's such a nice night out.

1105
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:47,688
I got a flashlight.

1106
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,647
You're not scared, are you?

1107
01:14:51,737 --> 01:14:52,737
No.

1108
01:14:53,698 --> 01:14:55,689
- All right.
- Great.

1109
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:02,282
Do you know what that constellation is”?

1110
01:15:02,373 --> 01:15:03,408
No. What is it?

1111
01:15:04,542 --> 01:15:06,624
I don't know. That's why I was asking you.

1112
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,374
Take it easy, guys. You guys drive safe.

1113
01:15:11,465 --> 01:15:14,345
- So what happened to Tatum, stu?
- Probably got pissed at me and bailed.

1114
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,507
Z==sai=s == -_- ee

1115
01:15:18,222 --> 01:15:19,928
I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding you.

1116
01:15:28,315 --> 01:15:29,315
Hey.

1117
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:39,232
Look! Here comes the obligatory tit shot.

1118
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,745
- Yes!
- Lovely!

1119
01:15:47,043 --> 01:15:48,374
Oh, my god.

1120
01:15:48,461 --> 01:15:49,871
I'll leave you guys alone.

1121
01:15:51,172 --> 01:15:52,582
You are so...

1122
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:55,547
Amazing.

1123
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:03,099
Hello?

1124
01:16:03,642 --> 01:16:04,642
Yeah.

1125
01:16:09,523 --> 01:16:11,184
Holy shit.

1126
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:14,194
No...

1127
01:16:15,654 --> 01:16:16,985
Listen up.

1128
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:18,904
They found principal himbry dead.

1129
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,950
He was gutted and hung
from the goalpost on the football field.

1130
01:16:23,037 --> 01:16:24,322
What are we waiting for?

1131
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,574
Let's go over there
before they pry him down.

1132
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:28,416
Hey.

1133
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:30,668
Hey.

1134
01:16:30,753 --> 01:16:32,163
Hey, where'd he say he was?

1135
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,040
The football field! Come on!

1136
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:35,917
Where you guys going?

1137
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,000
We were just getting to the good part.

1138
01:16:41,055 --> 01:16:42,261
Hello?

1139
01:16:42,348 --> 01:16:43,348
Yeah.

1140
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,329
Come on! Let's go!

1141
01:17:10,251 --> 01:17:12,116
So, is Dewey your real name?

1142
01:17:13,003 --> 01:17:14,539
No, it's Dwight.

1143
01:17:14,630 --> 01:17:15,630
Dwight?

1144
01:17:16,257 --> 01:17:18,464
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

1145
01:17:19,093 --> 01:17:21,675
Dewey's just something I got stuck with
a long time ago.

1146
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:23,923
Well, I like it.

1147
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:26,724
Sexy.

1148
01:17:27,268 --> 01:17:28,348
Sexy?

1149
01:17:30,187 --> 01:17:32,894
It's just this town's way
of not taking me serious.

1150
01:17:33,566 --> 01:17:35,056
What about Gale weathers?

1151
01:17:36,318 --> 01:17:38,855
Sounds like I'm a meteorologist
or something.

1152
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:44,399
People treat me like I'm the antichrist
of television journalism.

1153
01:17:45,661 --> 01:17:47,026
I don't think you're that bad.

1154
01:17:47,121 --> 01:17:48,201
==

1155
01:17:48,289 --> 01:17:50,245
I think that's just 'cause
you kind of like me.

1156
01:17:50,916 --> 01:17:53,953
They sure are coming fast.
Slow down. Freeze!

1157
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:00,550
I'm sorry.

1158
01:18:01,093 --> 01:18:02,549
Are you okay? Yeah.

1159
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:16,399
I'm sorry.

1160
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,061
I'm on duty.

1161
01:18:26,994 --> 01:18:28,404
Is that what you're looking for?

1162
01:18:29,496 --> 01:18:30,531
My whole life.

1163
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:37,952
Damn. “What?

1164
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,920
- What is it?
- This is Neil Prescott's car.

1165
01:18:41,008 --> 01:18:42,623
Sidney's father? Yeah.

1166
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,426
Jesus. What's he doing here?

1167
01:18:48,349 --> 01:18:49,429
We got to get back.

1168
01:18:53,979 --> 01:18:54,979
Are you okay?

1169
01:18:57,483 --> 01:18:58,483
Yeah.

1170
01:18:59,526 --> 01:19:00,606
Yeah, I'm fine.

1171
01:19:12,039 --> 01:19:13,154
Who'd you call?

1172
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:15,034
What?

1173
01:19:15,918 --> 01:19:17,783
Well, I don't know. When you're arrested,

1174
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:21,245
you're allowed one phone call,
so I was just curious. Who'd you call?

1175
01:19:24,510 --> 01:19:25,670
I called my dad.

1176
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:31,714
No. Sheriff Burke called your dad.
I saw him.

1177
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:38,061
Yeah. But when I called,
I didn't get an answer.

1178
01:19:49,785 --> 01:19:51,776
You don't still think it was me, do you?

1179
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,000
No.

1180
01:19:58,752 --> 01:19:59,752
No.

1181
01:20:00,379 --> 01:20:01,835
I was just thinking if it were you,

1182
01:20:01,922 --> 01:20:04,959
it'd be a very clever way
to throw me off track.

1183
01:20:05,050 --> 01:20:06,881
You know, using your one phone call
to call me

1184
01:20:06,969 --> 01:20:09,210
so that I wouldn't think it was you.
That's all.

1185
01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,008
Really?

1186
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:24,393
What do I have to do to prove to you
that I'm not a killer?

1187
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,273
Oh, my god.

1188
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:31,656
- Oh, my god!
- Sidney.

1189
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,744
Billy, watch out!

1190
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:44,255
Sid.

1191
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:22,877
Shit.

1192
01:21:29,510 --> 01:21:31,796
Help me, somebody! Help me!

1193
01:21:50,280 --> 01:21:51,280
Help me!

1194
01:22:22,646 --> 01:22:23,931
No, Jamie.

1195
01:22:25,858 --> 01:22:27,064
Watch out.

1196
01:22:27,609 --> 01:22:29,770
Watch out, Jamie. You know he's around.

1197
01:22:29,862 --> 01:22:31,068
You... you know...

1198
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:36,823
There he is. I told you.
I told you. He's right around the corner.

1199
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:40,239
Jamie... Jamie.

1200
01:22:41,665 --> 01:22:46,034
Jamie, look behind you.
Look behind you. Turn around.

1201
01:22:47,254 --> 01:22:49,415
Behind you. Turn...

1202
01:22:50,257 --> 01:22:51,667
Behind you.

1203
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:54,045
Behind you, Jamie.

1204
01:22:54,887 --> 01:22:59,051
Jamie, turn around.
All right! You turned around.

1205
01:22:59,141 --> 01:23:00,756
Help me! Help!

1206
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:15,104
Let me in!

1207
01:23:17,409 --> 01:23:19,409
The killer's after me. He's in the house.
“Where?

1208
01:23:19,453 --> 01:23:21,614
Wait a minute.
There's a camera in the house. Look.

1209
01:23:21,705 --> 01:23:24,196
Behind you!

1210
01:23:25,083 --> 01:23:26,163
- Oh, shit.
- No.

1211
01:23:27,002 --> 01:23:28,412
Jamie, Jamie...

1212
01:23:28,504 --> 01:23:29,544
- Behind you, kid!
- Randy!

1213
01:23:30,756 --> 01:23:33,122
- Behind you!
- I ook around.

1214
01:23:35,886 --> 01:23:37,126
Shit.

1215
01:23:37,221 --> 01:23:38,927
- What?
- We're on a 30-second delay.

1216
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:40,806
Oh, my god.

1217
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:35,897
- Is there a phone in the Van?
- Yeah.

1218
01:24:37,698 --> 01:24:40,155
Lock yourself in it.
Call the sheriff for backup.

1219
01:24:42,661 --> 01:24:43,661
Be careful.

1220
01:24:57,676 --> 01:24:58,676
Neil?

1221
01:25:05,142 --> 01:25:06,302
Mr. Prescott?

1222
01:25:27,164 --> 01:25:28,700
Kenny, I need the cellular!

1223
01:25:33,170 --> 01:25:34,205
Kenny!

1224
01:25:36,048 --> 01:25:37,048
Kenny!

1225
01:26:02,741 --> 01:26:04,231
- 911.
- What's going on?

1226
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:19,924
Oh, god.

1227
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:39,896
Oh, god, Kenny, I'm sorry,
but get off my fucking windshield!

1228
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,364
Stop!

1229
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:56,408
Nol!

1230
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:07,722
Dewey!

1231
01:27:09,266 --> 01:27:10,426
Dewey, where are you?

1232
01:27:13,311 --> 01:27:14,311
Dewey!

1233
01:27:16,356 --> 01:27:17,391
Sidney?

1234
01:27:23,071 --> 01:27:24,071
Dewey!

1235
01:27:52,642 --> 01:27:53,642
Shit.

1236
01:28:24,382 --> 01:28:27,340
Hello? Help me, please.
I'm at stu macher's house on Turner Lane.

1237
01:28:27,427 --> 01:28:31,215
It's 261 Turner Lane. Please!
He's gonna try and kill me!

1238
01:28:31,765 --> 01:28:33,221
Oh, god!

1239
01:28:54,204 --> 01:28:55,819
Sidney!

1240
01:28:56,957 --> 01:28:59,915
Sidney, Jesus,
we got to get the fuck out of here!

1241
01:29:00,001 --> 01:29:01,832
- Stop right there!
- Don't shoot! It's me!

1242
01:29:01,920 --> 01:29:04,377
I found Tatum.
She's dead! I think stu did it.

1243
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:06,420
- Don't listen to him, Sidney!
- Stay back.

1244
01:29:06,508 --> 01:29:08,339
- Stu did it!
- He killed Billy.

1245
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:10,712
- He killed my Tatum. He killed Billy.
- Stu did it.

1246
01:29:10,804 --> 01:29:12,340
- No, I didn't!
- He's lying!

1247
01:29:12,430 --> 01:29:16,093
Sidney, baby, please give me that gun.
Give me that gun! He killed Billy.

1248
01:29:16,184 --> 01:29:19,221
No, I didn't, sid. He did it!

1249
01:29:19,312 --> 01:29:20,893
He did it, Sidney!

1250
01:29:20,981 --> 01:29:22,846
Please, I didn't do it. He did it. Please!

1251
01:29:22,941 --> 01:29:25,432
- Please, Sidney!
- Fuck you both!

1252
01:29:25,527 --> 01:29:26,562
- Please.
- No! No!

1253
01:29:26,653 --> 01:29:27,688
Sidney!

1254
01:29:28,947 --> 01:29:31,188
Open up, sid! We won't make it!

1255
01:29:32,868 --> 01:29:34,733
Help me, he's gone crazy!

1256
01:29:35,662 --> 01:29:37,277
- Sidney!
- Go away!

1257
01:29:37,998 --> 01:29:38,998
Sidney?

1258
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,490
Leave me alone.

1259
01:29:56,725 --> 01:29:59,091
- Billy! Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1260
01:29:59,185 --> 01:30:01,346
Oh, god. I thought you were dead.

1261
01:30:01,438 --> 01:30:03,804
No. I mean, I got stuck pretty bad...

1262
01:30:04,441 --> 01:30:05,441
Get up.

1263
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:08,566
- You okay?
- You're bleeding.

1264
01:30:09,988 --> 01:30:11,228
- Oh, my god.
- Gotta get help.

1265
01:30:11,323 --> 01:30:12,403
No! He's out there!

1266
01:30:12,490 --> 01:30:16,483
No. Give me the gun. Give me the gun.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

1267
01:30:17,537 --> 01:30:18,537
Careful.

1268
01:30:20,582 --> 01:30:22,447
- Please help me!
- Get in. Get in.

1269
01:30:23,126 --> 01:30:25,412
Stu's flipped out! He's gone mad!

1270
01:30:27,923 --> 01:30:30,005
We all go a little mad sometimes.

1271
01:30:30,091 --> 01:30:31,672
- No, Billy!
- Oh, fuck!

1272
01:30:38,934 --> 01:30:40,845
Anthony Perkins, psycho.

1273
01:30:48,234 --> 01:30:49,599
Corn syrup.

1274
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,026
Same stuff they used
for pig's blood in Carrie.

1275
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:54,729
No. No.

1276
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:58,567
Stu, help me, please.

1277
01:31:01,498 --> 01:31:03,409
Surprise, Sidney.

1278
01:31:07,712 --> 01:31:09,327
Nol!

1279
01:31:10,423 --> 01:31:11,423
Oh, now.

1280
01:31:15,512 --> 01:31:18,299
What's the matter, Sidney?
You look like you've seen a ghost.

1281
01:31:19,349 --> 01:31:20,885
Why are you doing this?

1282
01:31:20,976 --> 01:31:23,137
It's all part of the game, Sidney.

1283
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,970
- It's called guess how I'm gonna die!
- Fuck you!

1284
01:31:26,064 --> 01:31:29,852
No, no, no, no. We already played
that game, remember?

1285
01:31:30,735 --> 01:31:32,225
You lost.

1286
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,776
See, fun and games, Sidney.

1287
01:31:33,863 --> 01:31:36,650
See, we ask you a question.
If you get it wrong...

1288
01:31:38,076 --> 01:31:39,076
You die.

1289
01:31:39,160 --> 01:31:41,367
If you get it right, you die.

1290
01:31:42,288 --> 01:31:43,903
You're crazy, both of you.

1291
01:31:43,999 --> 01:31:46,115
Actually we prefer the term psychotic.

1292
01:31:46,209 --> 01:31:47,574
You'll never get away with this.

1293
01:31:48,670 --> 01:31:49,670
Oh, no?

1294
01:31:50,880 --> 01:31:52,495
Tell that to cotton weary.

1295
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:55,965
You wouldn't believe
how easy he was to frame.

1296
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:59,093
Watch a few movies, take a few notes.

1297
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:01,338
It was fun.

1298
01:32:01,975 --> 01:32:03,966
» -no! Here you going?

1299
01:32:05,937 --> 01:32:06,937
Why?

1300
01:32:08,732 --> 01:32:10,097
Why did you kill my mother?

1301
01:32:10,191 --> 01:32:12,648
Why?

1302
01:32:14,696 --> 01:32:16,652
You hear that, stu?
I think she wants a motive.

1303
01:32:18,867 --> 01:32:20,152
I don't believe in motives, sid.

1304
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:22,655
- I mean, did Norman bates have a motive?
- No.

1305
01:32:22,746 --> 01:32:25,349
Did they ever really decide why
Hannibal Lecter liked to eat people?

1306
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:26,909
Don't think so.

1307
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:29,616
See, it's a lot scarier
when there's no motive, sid.

1308
01:32:30,962 --> 01:32:32,372
We did your mom a favor, sid.

1309
01:32:32,464 --> 01:32:35,080
That woman was a slutbag whore
who flashed her shit all over town

1310
01:32:35,175 --> 01:32:37,040
like she was Sharon stone or something.

1311
01:32:37,135 --> 01:32:39,655
Yeah, we put her out of her misery,
'cause let's face it, Sidney,

1312
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:41,920
your mother was no Sharon stone.

1313
01:32:48,063 --> 01:32:49,599
Is that motive enough for you?

1314
01:32:52,734 --> 01:32:54,019
How about this?

1315
01:32:55,695 --> 01:32:59,313
Your slut mother was fucking my father...

1316
01:33:01,326 --> 01:33:04,318
And she's the reason
my mom moved out and abandoned me.

1317
01:33:07,207 --> 01:33:08,663
How's that for a motive?

1318
01:33:10,418 --> 01:33:12,784
Maternal abandonment
causes serious deviant behavior.

1319
01:33:12,879 --> 01:33:15,495
Certainly fucked you up.
It made you have sex with a psychopath.

1320
01:33:16,091 --> 01:33:18,298
That's right. You gave it up.

1321
01:33:18,384 --> 01:33:20,045
Now you're no longer a virgin.

1322
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:21,880
I said "virgin."

1323
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:25,764
Now you gotta die. Those are the rules.

1324
01:33:25,850 --> 01:33:27,932
Just pretend it's all a scary movie, sid.

1325
01:33:28,645 --> 01:33:29,976
How do you think it's gonna end?

1326
01:33:34,317 --> 01:33:36,899
This is the greatest part!
You're gonna love this.

1327
01:33:36,986 --> 01:33:38,772
We got a surprise for you, Sidney.

1328
01:33:39,364 --> 01:33:42,356
Yeah, you're gonna love this one.
It's a scream, baby!

1329
01:33:42,450 --> 01:33:44,611
Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.

1330
01:33:46,454 --> 01:33:47,785
Know what time it is, sid?

1331
01:33:48,540 --> 01:33:49,620
It's after midnight.

1332
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:52,073
It's your mom's anniversary.

1333
01:33:52,836 --> 01:33:56,420
Congratulations. We killed her exactly
one year ago today.

1334
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:58,663
Attention.

1335
01:33:59,759 --> 01:34:01,750
What do we have
behind door number three, Sidney?

1336
01:34:01,845 --> 01:34:04,632
- Daddy!
- Hold it. That's enough.

1337
01:34:06,015 --> 01:34:08,677
Guess we won't be needing
this anymore, huh?

1338
01:34:08,768 --> 01:34:10,850
And, oh, look at this. Ring, ring.

1339
01:34:10,937 --> 01:34:12,052
Won't need this.

1340
01:34:12,147 --> 01:34:13,728
Got the ending figured out yet, sid?

1341
01:34:13,815 --> 01:34:15,976
Come on, Sidney,
you think about it now, huh?

1342
01:34:16,067 --> 01:34:19,025
Your daddy's the chief suspect.
We cloned his cellular.

1343
01:34:19,112 --> 01:34:21,068
Evidence is all right there, baby.

1344
01:34:21,156 --> 01:34:23,717
What if your father snapped,
your mother's anniversary set him off,

1345
01:34:23,741 --> 01:34:25,902
and he went on a murder spree
killing everyone?

1346
01:34:25,994 --> 01:34:28,235
Except for Billy and me.
We were left for dead.

1347
01:34:28,329 --> 01:34:33,198
Then he kills you
and shoots himself in the head.

1348
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:35,207
Perfect ending.

1349
01:34:35,295 --> 01:34:37,081
I thought of that.

1350
01:34:37,839 --> 01:34:38,954
Watch this.

1351
01:34:43,845 --> 01:34:45,176
You ready? Yeah.

1352
01:34:45,263 --> 01:34:49,381
Yeah! I'm ready, baby! Hit it!

1353
01:34:49,475 --> 01:34:52,262
Giddyap! Yeah, man! Giddyap! Hit it!

1354
01:34:57,066 --> 01:34:59,648
Good one, man! Jesus!

1355
01:34:59,736 --> 01:35:02,227
Oh, shit! My turn.

1356
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:08,900
Don't forget.
Stay to the side and don't go too deep.

1357
01:35:10,246 --> 01:35:12,532
Okay. I'll remember.

1358
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:15,490
Fuck!

1359
01:35:17,128 --> 01:35:19,039
Fuck! God damn it, stu!

1360
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:22,751
Sorry, Billy.
I guess I got a little too zealous, huh?

1361
01:35:24,052 --> 01:35:25,883
- Give me the knife.
- No.

1362
01:35:27,096 --> 01:35:28,302
Give me the knifel

1363
01:35:31,684 --> 01:35:33,015
now!

1364
01:35:35,855 --> 01:35:40,645
You see, sid? Everybody dies, but us.
Everybody dies, but us!

1365
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:43,272
We get to carry on and plan the sequel

1366
01:35:43,363 --> 01:35:47,652
'cause let's face it, baby,
these days, you gotta have a sequel!

1367
01:35:50,703 --> 01:35:53,285
You sick fucks.
You've seen one too many movies.

1368
01:35:53,373 --> 01:35:55,705
No, sid, don't you blame the movies!

1369
01:35:55,792 --> 01:35:59,660
Movies don't create psychos.
Movies make psychos more creative!

1370
01:36:01,631 --> 01:36:04,543
Stop it, man, would you? All right?
I can't take any more.

1371
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:07,467
I'm feeling a little woozy here!

1372
01:36:09,973 --> 01:36:10,973
All right.

1373
01:36:12,767 --> 01:36:15,884
You get the gun,
and I'll untie pops, okay?

1374
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:20,315
Now!

1375
01:36:21,484 --> 01:36:22,484
Okay.

1376
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:37,907
Houston, we have a problem here.

1377
01:36:39,961 --> 01:36:41,041
What?

1378
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:44,997
The gun, man. The gun.
I put it right here, and it's not there.

1379
01:36:46,259 --> 01:36:47,669
Where the fuck is it?

1380
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:48,966
Right here, asshole.

1381
01:36:51,806 --> 01:36:55,890
- Man, I thought she was dead.
- She looked dead, man. Still does.

1382
01:36:55,977 --> 01:36:57,467
I've got an ending for you.

1383
01:36:57,562 --> 01:37:00,019
"The reporter left for dead
in the news Van

1384
01:37:00,606 --> 01:37:05,066
comes to, stumbles on you two dipshits,

1385
01:37:05,945 --> 01:37:10,405
finds the gun,
foils your plan, and saves the day."

1386
01:37:12,243 --> 01:37:13,608
I like that ending.

1387
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:17,161
I know something you don't.

1388
01:37:26,007 --> 01:37:27,213
Yeah, man!

1389
01:37:28,384 --> 01:37:29,384
Yeah.

1390
01:37:31,512 --> 01:37:32,843
So sweet.

1391
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:39,429
Works better without the safety on.

1392
01:37:48,237 --> 01:37:50,444
"This is Gale weathers, signing off."

1393
01:37:50,531 --> 01:37:52,613
Baby, you are gonna love this.

1394
01:37:54,786 --> 01:37:55,901
Shit.

1395
01:37:58,498 --> 01:37:59,498
What?

1396
01:38:06,214 --> 01:38:07,750
Where are they? Where are they?

1397
01:38:10,718 --> 01:38:11,753
Fuck!

1398
01:38:14,222 --> 01:38:15,803
Should I let the machine get it?

1399
01:38:17,850 --> 01:38:19,761
- Hello?
- Are you alone in the house?

1400
01:38:20,645 --> 01:38:23,011
Bitch! You bitch! Where the fuck are you?

1401
01:38:23,106 --> 01:38:25,848
Not so fast.
We're gonna play a little game.

1402
01:38:25,942 --> 01:38:27,662
It's called
guess who just called the police

1403
01:38:27,735 --> 01:38:29,817
and reported your sorry motherfucking ass!

1404
01:38:30,488 --> 01:38:32,353
Find her, you dipshit! Get up!

1405
01:38:32,448 --> 01:38:36,566
I can't, Billy. You cut me too deep.
I think I'm dying here, man.

1406
01:38:40,081 --> 01:38:41,912
Talk to her. Talk to her.

1407
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:50,296
Hello?

1408
01:38:50,383 --> 01:38:54,467
Aw, stu, stu, stu.
What's your motive? Billy's got one.

1409
01:38:54,554 --> 01:38:56,840
The police are on their way.
What are you gonna tell them?

1410
01:38:56,931 --> 01:38:59,297
Peer pressure. I'm far too sensitive...

1411
01:38:59,392 --> 01:39:02,008
I'm gonna rip you up, you bitch!
Just like your fucking mother!

1412
01:39:02,103 --> 01:39:04,560
You've golia find me first,
you pansy-ass mama's boy!

1413
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:05,647
Fuck!

1414
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:08,560
Fucking hit me with the phone, dick!

1415
01:39:09,694 --> 01:39:10,854
Fucker, where are you?

1416
01:39:13,448 --> 01:39:14,448
You fuck!

1417
01:39:16,909 --> 01:39:18,399
Did you really call the police?

1418
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:20,030
You bet your sorry ass I did.

1419
01:39:20,997 --> 01:39:24,330
My mom and dad are gonna be so mad at me.

1420
01:39:25,751 --> 01:39:26,751
Bitch!

1421
01:40:24,310 --> 01:40:25,310
My eyes!

1422
01:40:33,569 --> 01:40:35,981
I always had a thing for you, sid!

1423
01:40:39,325 --> 01:40:40,531
God.

1424
01:40:41,702 --> 01:40:42,702
Bitch.

1425
01:40:43,746 --> 01:40:44,826
In your dreams.

1426
01:41:09,897 --> 01:41:11,728
Sid! I'm sorry. It's all right.

1427
01:41:11,816 --> 01:41:13,898
Oh, my god, Randy.
I thought you were dead.

1428
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:16,943
I probably should be. I never thought
I'd be so happy to be a virgin.

1429
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:19,239
Fucker!

1430
01:41:26,289 --> 01:41:27,825
Say hello to your mother.

1431
01:42:03,492 --> 01:42:04,492
It's okay.

1432
01:42:08,372 --> 01:42:11,159
Guess I remembered the safety that time,
you bastard.

1433
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:24,804
Careful.

1434
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:29,132
This is the moment when the supposedly
dead killer comes back to life

1435
01:42:29,226 --> 01:42:30,591
for one last scare.

1436
01:42:36,192 --> 01:42:37,557
Not in my movie.

1437
01:42:43,658 --> 01:42:44,773
Dad.

1438
01:42:45,868 --> 01:42:47,404
Randy, help me out.

1439
01:42:52,041 --> 01:42:53,076
Are you okay?

1440
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:57,785
Are you okay? Yeah.

1441
01:42:59,674 --> 01:43:01,505
- Hang in there, buddy.
- All right.

1442
01:43:03,469 --> 01:43:05,380
It collapses. Where's Gale?

1443
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:09,176
Okay, I think it's gonna go
something like this. Just stay with me.

1444
01:43:11,352 --> 01:43:14,719
Hi. This is Gale weathers
with an exclusive eyewitness account

1445
01:43:14,814 --> 01:43:16,725
of this amazing breaking story.

1446
01:43:17,900 --> 01:43:22,360
Several more local teens are dead,
bringing to an end the harrowing mystery

1447
01:43:22,446 --> 01:43:25,779
of the mass killing
that has terrified this peaceful community

1448
01:43:25,866 --> 01:43:27,948
like the plot of some scary movie.

1449
01:43:28,661 --> 01:43:31,243
It all began with a scream over 911

1450
01:43:31,330 --> 01:43:34,993
and ended in a bloodbath
that has rocked the town of woodsboro,

1451
01:43:35,626 --> 01:43:38,083
all played out here
in this peaceful farmhouse,

1452
01:43:38,170 --> 01:43:40,912
far from the crimes and the sirens
of the larger cities

1453
01:43:41,006 --> 01:43:42,917
that its residents have fled.

1454
01:43:43,008 --> 01:43:44,498
Okay, let's take it back to one.

1455
01:43:44,593 --> 01:43:47,209
Come on. Move it.
This is my big shot. Let's go.
