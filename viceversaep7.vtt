00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:20.801
Joob suddenly passed.

00:00:20.801 --> 00:00:23.678
Joob always said nothing in life was certain.

00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:25.969
Whatever I want to do, do it now.

00:00:25.969 --> 00:00:27.269
But now

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.561
there’s one thing I want to do the most.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:32.164
Can I hug you to sleep all night tonight?

00:00:35.804 --> 00:00:37.145
Good night.

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:14.795
Guys,

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.042
my condolences for Joob’s passing.

00:01:20.411 --> 00:01:21.853
You guys seemed so close.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.428
Right.

00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:26.639
Actually, you don’t need to come to the meeting.

00:01:26.798 --> 00:01:27.764
You guys can take a break.

00:01:28.213 --> 00:01:29.358
That’s alright.

00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:30.293
We’re okay.

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:31.760
Are you sure?

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:35.962
Who’s that?

00:01:36.706 --> 00:01:39.640
I got you guys someone to help write the screenplay.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.440
Someone with new perspectives.

00:01:41.573 --> 00:01:42.597
It should help.

00:01:42.597 --> 00:01:44.322
I’ll get the door.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.432
Guys,

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.433
this is Pang, my older friend.

00:02:03.897 --> 00:02:07.280
She’s a yoga instructor and an acting coach.

00:02:07.502 --> 00:02:10.166
Hello, beautiful.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:11.324
Hi, everyone.

00:02:11.324 --> 00:02:13.795
Pang is going to help us with the screenplay.

00:03:25.987 --> 00:03:27.360
Let’s start from mine.

00:03:27.494 --> 00:03:29.494
The story of a group of four friends.

00:03:29.494 --> 00:03:31.164
They go to a bachelor party.

00:03:31.275 --> 00:03:35.000
They get wasted and lose the groom-to-be.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.001
The rest of them must find where the groom is.

00:03:39.214 --> 00:03:40.039
Hold on.

00:03:40.677 --> 00:03:42.438
That’s a romantic movie?

00:03:42.734 --> 00:03:43.964
It’s a comedy.

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:45.079
Here.

00:03:45.238 --> 00:03:46.760
Listen to mine.

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:48.648
I want to make an indie movie.

00:03:48.648 --> 00:03:49.816
Don’t follow any movie rules.

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:51.966
It’s about the day before the apocalypse.

00:03:51.966 --> 00:03:54.533
The male lead breaks up with the female lead the day before the apocalypse.

00:03:54.533 --> 00:04:00.296
He tells her they should separate and do whatever they want before they die.

00:04:03.585 --> 00:04:04.708
So deep.

00:04:05.306 --> 00:04:07.093
My turn now.

00:04:07.093 --> 00:04:10.787
It’s about a guy who falls in love with a girl but he is sent to work on the moon.

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.870
So it’s love between two planets.

00:04:13.124 --> 00:04:15.894
They get to video call only once a month.

00:04:17.393 --> 00:04:18.676
Clearly.

00:04:18.676 --> 00:04:20.522
Exactly like the last movie we made.

00:04:22.854 --> 00:04:24.000
What are we gonna do?

00:04:24.235 --> 00:04:25.730
A comedy.

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.960
Make the audience laugh along with the characters’ love.

00:04:29.288 --> 00:04:31.288
Love isn’t something funny.

00:04:32.228 --> 00:04:34.720
And I hate to see people laugh at my love story.

00:04:38.776 --> 00:04:41.945
How about a romantic-not-comedy movie?

00:04:45.891 --> 00:04:48.104
Up’s a sense of humor,

00:04:48.535 --> 00:04:50.296
Aou’s outside-the-box thinking,

00:04:50.913 --> 00:04:52.640
Tun’s romance,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:55.926
and Talay’s seriousness mixed together.

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:58.600
They create a romantic but not comedy movie.

00:05:01.355 --> 00:05:05.241
The love story that seems funny but actually not.

00:05:05.815 --> 00:05:07.815
Yes! This is cool.

00:05:08.283 --> 00:05:10.283
Let’s go with this concept.

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.609
‘Romantic Not Comedy.’

00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:20.324
Hey! Come on.

00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:28.308
Friend Credits.

00:05:45.769 --> 00:05:48.008
Why did you include Pang without consulting me?

00:05:52.982 --> 00:05:58.542
I think our script should be more mellow if there’s a girl on the team.

00:06:08.915 --> 00:06:10.171
That’s really it?

00:06:17.776 --> 00:06:18.806
The truth is

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:23.628
I’m afraid you’d die.

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:30.031
Anything that helps you go back as soon as possible,

00:06:31.944 --> 00:06:33.224
I’ll do it.

00:06:37.693 --> 00:06:38.898
What do you mean?

00:06:44.025 --> 00:06:45.404
Well, you said

00:06:46.761 --> 00:06:49.425
Pang is special to you.

00:06:51.173 --> 00:06:54.554
I think she might be your portkey.

00:07:01.602 --> 00:07:02.614
And you?

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.868
Aren’t you going back too?

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.904
I will keep looking for my portkey.

00:07:14.397 --> 00:07:19.452
Hasn’t it ever occurred to you that I’m your portkey?

00:07:29.182 --> 00:07:30.263
If you are,

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:33.653
we’d be back by now.

00:07:38.902 --> 00:07:40.344
I’m done washing the dishes.

00:07:41.493 --> 00:07:42.616
I’ll go back to the meeting.

00:07:51.782 --> 00:07:54.074
I think we should call it a day.

00:07:54.115 --> 00:07:55.982
Our idea has begun to form.

00:07:56.573 --> 00:07:58.573
I’ll share with you guys the summary.

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:00.000
All right, guys.

00:08:00.153 --> 00:08:02.153
I’m going to go home and watch a movie.

00:08:02.351 --> 00:08:03.544
Motivating myself.

00:08:03.544 --> 00:08:04.351
I’m tired.

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:06.863
Pang.

00:08:06.863 --> 00:08:07.521
Hm.

00:08:07.687 --> 00:08:09.289
May I have a word with you?

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:10.811
I need to consult you about something.

00:08:11.063 --> 00:08:12.983
Absolutely.

00:08:17.227 --> 00:08:19.227
Should we take it outside? It’s pretty packed here.

00:08:21.299 --> 00:08:22.073
Okay.

00:08:35.895 --> 00:08:39.276
Do you think there’s something going on between Tun and Pang?

00:08:39.614 --> 00:08:40.323
Tess.

00:08:40.536 --> 00:08:41.668
Do you know anything?

00:08:43.693 --> 00:08:45.000
It’s nothing.

00:08:45.888 --> 00:08:47.755
Pang is simply nice.

00:08:48.668 --> 00:08:50.216
Come on. Get your stuff.

00:08:58.005 --> 00:08:58.936
There.

00:08:59.334 --> 00:09:00.801
Sleeping in.

00:09:00.801 --> 00:09:02.350
Will you wake him up for me?

00:09:02.572 --> 00:09:03.602
Of course.

00:09:10.961 --> 00:09:12.941
Tun, it’s late.

00:09:16.692 --> 00:09:18.533
Tun, wake up.

00:09:21.941 --> 00:09:23.197
Not getting up, are you?

00:09:24.821 --> 00:09:26.290
Get up, Tun.

00:09:28.244 --> 00:09:29.171
I’m up.

00:09:29.809 --> 00:09:30.643
Hey.

00:09:30.776 --> 00:09:32.138
This is my t-shirt.

00:09:32.138 --> 00:09:34.141
I don’t remember you borrowing it.

00:09:34.468 --> 00:09:36.123
Don’t be such a hog.

00:09:36.123 --> 00:09:38.521
I sleep so well wearing it.

00:09:38.521 --> 00:09:41.240
When the smell is gone, I’ll return it to you.

00:09:41.734 --> 00:09:43.520
Wait. What smell?

00:09:44.657 --> 00:09:45.913
Well, it smells nice.

00:09:47.655 --> 00:09:48.800
The scent of you.

00:09:50.246 --> 00:09:51.840
It’s Tess’s perfume.

00:09:55.346 --> 00:09:56.629
Or maybe…

00:09:56.816 --> 00:09:58.232
it’s not the scent.

00:09:58.232 --> 00:10:00.943
It’s because I got to hug you all night that night.

00:10:01.253 --> 00:10:02.720
That’s what makes me sleep so well.

00:10:04.314 --> 00:10:05.517
I’m gonna keep on sleeping.

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:12.466
Get up and take a shower.

00:10:12.908 --> 00:10:14.430
Give me back my tee.

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:15.584
Go.

00:10:15.797 --> 00:10:16.636
No.

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:17.760
I’ll take it.

00:10:18.092 --> 00:10:19.879
That’s Tess’s.

00:10:20.168 --> 00:10:21.451
Take it off.

00:10:21.451 --> 00:10:22.057
Hey!

00:10:22.057 --> 00:10:23.720
What are you doing? No.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.954
Will you take it off or not?

00:10:26.239 --> 00:10:27.042
Take it off.

00:10:34.348 --> 00:10:35.253
That’s it.

00:10:35.341 --> 00:10:36.836
Fine. I won’t take the tee.

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:39.666
But can you do that again?

00:10:39.879 --> 00:10:40.666
I like it.

00:10:40.923 --> 00:10:41.993
Nonsense.

00:10:42.729 --> 00:10:44.543
Get up and clean yourself.

00:10:44.543 --> 00:10:45.495
Come on.

00:10:45.798 --> 00:10:47.160
You took my tee off.

00:10:47.426 --> 00:10:48.994
You give me a shower.

00:10:51.893 --> 00:10:52.764
Ouch!

00:10:53.083 --> 00:10:55.000
I can choke to death here.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.572
You said you didn’t want me to die yesterday.

00:11:01.389 --> 00:11:02.592
Sit still.

00:11:07.685 --> 00:11:09.287
How is it going with Pang?

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:11.671
Do you feel anything?

00:11:17.504 --> 00:11:19.504
Not at all.

00:11:21.078 --> 00:11:23.291
Hey, don’t be disheartened.

00:11:23.893 --> 00:11:25.149
Try a little harder.

00:11:25.475 --> 00:11:26.891
You can go home quickly.

00:11:28.066 --> 00:11:29.535
You always shoo me away.

00:11:29.807 --> 00:11:32.684
If I go back first, you’re going to miss me so badly.

00:11:33.317 --> 00:11:34.467
No way.

00:11:34.868 --> 00:11:37.027
Because I’m finding my own portkey too.

00:11:52.098 --> 00:11:54.098
I will not let you go back alone.

00:12:15.558 --> 00:12:16.628
How is it?

00:12:17.432 --> 00:12:18.901
I think it’s good.

00:12:19.853 --> 00:12:22.145
Just a small comment on the ending scene.

00:12:22.967 --> 00:12:24.622
The dialogue is a little too plain.

00:12:28.023 --> 00:12:29.545
I can’t make it better.

00:12:30.898 --> 00:12:32.314
My brain isn’t functioning.

00:12:33.935 --> 00:12:34.797
Hey.

00:12:35.995 --> 00:12:37.760
Should we go out and refuel ourselves?

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:39.126
Wanna catch a movie?

00:12:39.504 --> 00:12:40.998
A new romantic film just hit the cinema.

00:12:41.131 --> 00:12:43.337
Let’s do it. How about this evening?

00:12:43.337 --> 00:12:44.374
I can’t wait.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.209
Let’s go.

00:12:45.209 --> 00:12:46.440
I’m paying.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:50.539
Pang, wanna join us?

00:12:53.202 --> 00:12:55.972
I’ve got something to do this evening.

00:12:56.127 --> 00:12:57.675
Maybe next time.

00:12:57.675 --> 00:12:58.793
I won’t miss it.

00:13:00.475 --> 00:13:01.465
How sad.

00:13:01.465 --> 00:13:02.668
I know what you’re thinking.

00:13:24.393 --> 00:13:26.898
Hey, you’re home.

00:13:26.939 --> 00:13:28.115
Should we go drink tonight?

00:13:28.919 --> 00:13:30.093
I’ve already got plans.

00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.610
What?

00:13:32.253 --> 00:13:33.164
Who are you meeting?

00:13:33.675 --> 00:13:35.330
The screenwriting team.

00:13:36.956 --> 00:13:38.360
Are you sure?

00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:41.720
What are you doing anyway?

00:13:42.563 --> 00:13:44.058
Sniffing like a dog.

00:13:55.641 --> 00:13:58.120
It’s like you’re preparing for a date.

00:13:58.684 --> 00:14:00.179
A date, my ass.

00:14:00.835 --> 00:14:02.240
The whole group is going.

00:14:07.984 --> 00:14:09.984
Are you wearing perfume for everyone on the planet?

00:14:10.946 --> 00:14:11.863
Talking too much.

00:14:13.882 --> 00:14:16.920
I’m talking too much?

00:14:29.502 --> 00:14:31.502
May I redeem my points for a discount?

00:14:47.244 --> 00:14:48.050
Hello.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:49.669
(Where are you? We’re at the cinema.)

00:14:49.669 --> 00:14:50.525
(Hurry up.)

00:14:53.513 --> 00:14:55.000
Wow!

00:14:55.332 --> 00:14:57.704
I don’t even have to turn around.

00:14:58.077 --> 00:14:58.875
Tess,

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.640
you want people on different planets to scent your perfume or what?

00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.305
Super strong.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.664
It’s a movie night with friends. Why dressed up?

00:15:07.664 --> 00:15:08.450
Yeah?

00:15:09.029 --> 00:15:10.418
This is normal.

00:15:13.176 --> 00:15:14.378
Maybe I put on so much.

00:15:15.176 --> 00:15:17.320
So much.

00:15:19.627 --> 00:15:21.229
And where is Tun?

00:15:21.229 --> 00:15:23.910
He called and said he needed to bail last minute.

00:15:24.022 --> 00:15:25.920
He’s got something to do with Pang.

00:15:26.821 --> 00:15:28.396
Why did he tell us earlier?

00:15:28.535 --> 00:15:29.525
This asshole.

00:15:29.665 --> 00:15:31.665
He left his friends. Everyone is here but him.

00:15:34.032 --> 00:15:35.554
He has his reasons.

00:15:37.371 --> 00:15:38.760
And you’re defending him.

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.696
It’s all good.

00:15:40.696 --> 00:15:41.933
We can enjoy it just the three of us.

00:15:41.933 --> 00:15:43.252
Let’s go get the tickets.

00:15:43.252 --> 00:15:43.866
Yeah.

00:15:43.866 --> 00:15:46.848
Remember? You’re paying.

00:15:48.628 --> 00:15:49.417
Let’s go.

00:15:55.511 --> 00:15:57.840
If your friend does something that makes you feel bad,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:15:58.886
what will you do?

00:15:59.647 --> 00:16:01.222
Then you must live with it.

00:16:01.401 --> 00:16:05.200
Because the friend you mentioned must be more than just a friend.

00:16:49.334 --> 00:16:50.450
The movie nearly ends.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.252
You’ve still got lots of popped rice left.

00:16:53.141 --> 00:16:54.222
Yes, it’s a lot.

00:16:54.222 --> 00:16:55.622
Who can finish all this?

00:16:57.163 --> 00:16:58.596
Up and Aou.

00:16:59.101 --> 00:17:00.965
You’re not so much different.

00:17:01.107 --> 00:17:03.742
That’s why I like watching movies with you only.

00:17:03.943 --> 00:17:05.943
I eat a lot but you don’t.

00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:07.518
Perfect balance.

00:17:11.282 --> 00:17:14.220
So you asked me to a movie because I don’t eat a lot?

00:17:14.515 --> 00:17:15.325
That’s all?

00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.661
No.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.644
I just wanted to see a movie with you, alone.

00:17:20.337 --> 00:17:21.136
That’s all.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:09.067
Hey!

00:18:09.792 --> 00:18:11.164
What’s wrong? Why looking so dull?

00:18:12.277 --> 00:18:13.191
Sorry.

00:18:13.304 --> 00:18:14.390
I didn’t see you.

00:18:16.749 --> 00:18:18.160
Why are you apologizing?

00:18:18.256 --> 00:18:19.395
This is your place.

00:18:20.409 --> 00:18:21.700
So what’s wrong?

00:18:26.692 --> 00:18:27.696
I don’t know.

00:18:28.318 --> 00:18:30.794
I feel weird somehow.

00:18:37.963 --> 00:18:39.351
You’re not feeling weird.

00:18:39.787 --> 00:18:40.784
You’re feeling down.

00:18:40.988 --> 00:18:41.991
Who did anything to you?

00:18:47.273 --> 00:18:49.749
If your friend does something that makes you feel bad,

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:51.863
what will you do?

00:18:51.976 --> 00:18:53.175
Tell him to stop doing it.

00:18:53.491 --> 00:18:54.607
I can’t.

00:18:56.063 --> 00:18:57.950
I was the one telling him to do it.

00:18:59.656 --> 00:19:01.883
And it’s something he should do.

00:19:09.949 --> 00:19:11.632
Then you must live with it.

00:19:14.889 --> 00:19:18.498
It’s the first time only and I could barely take it.

00:19:20.672 --> 00:19:23.533
I don’t know how many more times I have to take it.

00:19:25.935 --> 00:19:26.977
Two times?

00:19:26.977 --> 00:19:27.754
No.

00:19:28.551 --> 00:19:30.102
I’m telling you to keep fighting.

00:19:33.186 --> 00:19:37.902
Because the friend you mentioned must be more than just a friend.

00:19:38.169 --> 00:19:39.100
Bastard.

00:19:39.508 --> 00:19:40.713
Don’t be a smart ass.

00:19:43.105 --> 00:19:46.148
And this is 20.

00:19:47.375 --> 00:19:51.097
But I think you can only take it two more times.

00:19:57.747 --> 00:19:59.747
I guess that’s all the patience I have.

00:20:01.673 --> 00:20:03.424
If that’s all you have, that’s all you have.

00:20:04.812 --> 00:20:05.907
Well, I’m going to bed.

00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.945
Hey!

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:09.585
What do you mean by going to bed?

00:20:10.407 --> 00:20:11.931
You won’t get any sleep.

00:20:12.407 --> 00:20:14.222
Let’s go make use of the bar.

00:20:14.222 --> 00:20:14.797
Come on.

00:20:15.223 --> 00:20:15.823
Let’s do it.

00:20:15.823 --> 00:20:17.404
I’ll keep you company tonight.

00:20:18.339 --> 00:20:19.382
Bottoms up.

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:22.299
Two more.

00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:29.325
Wait for me.

00:21:07.677 --> 00:21:08.703
[Tun]

00:21:13.054 --> 00:21:13.748
Hello.

00:21:13.884 --> 00:21:14.646
What’s up?

00:21:15.966 --> 00:21:17.076
(Is everything okay?)

00:21:17.439 --> 00:21:19.077
(I’d been calling but you didn’t answer.)

00:21:20.087 --> 00:21:21.243
Just a little sick.

00:21:21.492 --> 00:21:22.336
I’m fine.

00:21:23.531 --> 00:21:24.486
(Are you all right?)

00:21:24.690 --> 00:21:25.735
(Shouldn’t you go see a doctor?)

00:21:26.479 --> 00:21:27.492
No.

00:21:27.742 --> 00:21:28.570
I’m just…

00:21:28.781 --> 00:21:30.222
(Hold on one sec. Pang is calling.)

00:21:30.719 --> 00:21:32.130
(Let me call you back.)

00:21:55.441 --> 00:21:56.965
One sec, my freaking ass!

00:21:57.731 --> 00:21:59.119
I’ve been waiting for half an hour.

00:22:03.535 --> 00:22:04.900
You came to see me?

00:22:06.222 --> 00:22:07.044
Yes, I did.

00:22:07.548 --> 00:22:09.072
You were so drunk last night.

00:22:09.848 --> 00:22:10.964
I brought you congee.

00:22:21.257 --> 00:22:22.713
(Sorry I didn’t call you back.)

00:22:22.878 --> 00:22:24.515
(I’ll see you later at my house.)

00:22:24.748 --> 00:22:25.909
(I got caught up in something.)

00:22:31.324 --> 00:22:32.327
Let me guess.

00:22:33.171 --> 00:22:35.862
The third time you have to take it, right?

00:22:36.151 --> 00:22:36.954
No.

00:22:37.702 --> 00:22:39.148
This is only the second time.

00:22:40.091 --> 00:22:41.683
I’m almost knocked off my feet.

00:22:43.048 --> 00:22:44.731
I hope the third doesn’t come.

00:22:45.326 --> 00:22:46.656
Come on. Let’s eat congee.

00:22:46.656 --> 00:22:47.326
It’s getting cold.

00:22:48.681 --> 00:22:49.684
I’ll prepare it for you.

00:23:03.085 --> 00:23:04.234
They’re not here yet?

00:23:05.222 --> 00:23:06.277
I’m right here.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:10.953
Are you feeling better?

00:23:11.134 --> 00:23:12.160
I was so worried.

00:23:14.566 --> 00:23:15.795
I’m better.

00:23:16.888 --> 00:23:18.321
Just a bit of a headache left.

00:23:23.182 --> 00:23:26.202
You’re sick so I…

00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:28.159
You what?

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:34.793
Ta-da!

00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:05.137
A welcome back meal.

00:24:06.339 --> 00:24:07.090
Wow!

00:24:08.178 --> 00:24:09.200
Looks yummy.

00:24:10.469 --> 00:24:13.534
But why did you give me so much bacon?

00:24:13.934 --> 00:24:17.502
You keep saying you hate pink so I gave you a lot.

00:24:17.695 --> 00:24:18.792
It’s your prank?

00:24:19.649 --> 00:24:20.371
Sorry.

00:24:20.885 --> 00:24:23.112
This bacon pink is the pink that I love.

00:24:23.427 --> 00:24:24.611
You can’t prank me.

00:24:30.998 --> 00:24:31.744
So?

00:24:34.509 --> 00:24:35.514
Delish!

00:24:35.796 --> 00:24:36.935
Of course.

00:24:37.349 --> 00:24:39.258
It isn’t just usual carbonara.

00:24:39.456 --> 00:24:40.277
But it’s…

00:24:41.682 --> 00:24:43.496
carbo-narak (cute).

00:24:43.895 --> 00:24:44.941
What the heck?

00:24:45.576 --> 00:24:46.530
I almost choked on it.

00:24:49.015 --> 00:24:50.448
Cute or not?

00:24:53.174 --> 00:24:55.174
Yes, Mr. All-rounder.

00:24:56.663 --> 00:24:58.323
Is there anything you can’t do?

00:24:59.349 --> 00:25:00.941
One thing I’m not good at is love.

00:25:01.485 --> 00:25:03.122
It’s because I can do everything else.

00:25:05.223 --> 00:25:06.113
I don’t get it.

00:25:08.470 --> 00:25:10.872
People think I’m perfect.

00:25:11.237 --> 00:25:12.466
I can take care of myself.

00:25:13.243 --> 00:25:15.039
So nobody takes care of me.

00:25:15.838 --> 00:25:16.802
Actually,

00:25:17.369 --> 00:25:21.238
I’m just a man who can be weak and needs care.

00:25:22.753 --> 00:25:24.458
There, there.

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.368
Poor guy.

00:25:26.986 --> 00:25:31.094
People should know the real you is a crybaby.

00:25:35.222 --> 00:25:35.933
Right.

00:25:37.134 --> 00:25:39.134
Not many people see this side of me.

00:25:42.098 --> 00:25:43.259
You’re one of them.

00:25:50.222 --> 00:25:52.109
Damn!

00:25:53.178 --> 00:25:56.447
I’m wanting to know now who you really are.

00:25:58.094 --> 00:26:04.468
A perfect actor who is actually pouty like a kitten.

00:26:05.509 --> 00:26:06.738
I’m just me.

00:26:14.903 --> 00:26:15.697
By the way,

00:26:16.422 --> 00:26:18.829
Aou finished editing the dialogue in the ending scene.

00:26:19.527 --> 00:26:21.527
We’ll be presenting it to my dad next Monday.

00:26:24.791 --> 00:26:26.219
Will your dad be okay with it?

00:26:26.355 --> 00:26:27.176
I’m scared.

00:26:30.262 --> 00:26:32.102
Don’t be scared, kitten.

00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:51.438
I’m sure we breeze through this time.

00:26:52.020 --> 00:26:53.748
This is only a synopsis.

00:26:54.564 --> 00:26:56.111
Did you see Tess’s dad’s eyes?

00:26:56.521 --> 00:26:58.022
They were shining bright.

00:26:58.164 --> 00:27:01.102
What if we send him the full screenplay?

00:27:01.355 --> 00:27:03.355
Will he even cry?

00:27:05.399 --> 00:27:07.762
Next time, I’ll prepare him some facial tissue.

00:27:08.349 --> 00:27:11.686
I overheard him compliment our idea to his employees.

00:27:11.967 --> 00:27:15.780
Since the result can’t be a surprise, should we go celebrate?

00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:16.705
Get out of town.

00:27:17.047 --> 00:27:17.976
Good idea.

00:27:17.976 --> 00:27:20.502
We’ve got an RV after all.

00:27:21.014 --> 00:27:22.542
What do you say, boss Tun?

00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.805
Let’s do it.

00:27:23.941 --> 00:27:25.246
Changing the atmosphere.

00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:26.673
Cool.

00:27:27.217 --> 00:27:27.970
Let’s do it.

00:27:28.559 --> 00:27:29.474
When?

00:27:30.222 --> 00:27:31.080
When?

00:27:31.612 --> 00:27:33.045
Right now.

00:27:33.158 --> 00:27:34.090
Let’s go.

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:35.255
Right now!

00:27:35.255 --> 00:27:36.198
Come on.

00:27:37.025 --> 00:27:38.277
Take the wheel, Up.

00:27:44.207 --> 00:27:49.662
They say, write down 3 wishes that you want to happen this year.

00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:50.698
This time,

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.360
I can kiss you, can’t I?

00:28:26.937 --> 00:28:28.082
Up!!

00:28:28.353 --> 00:28:29.593
I told you.

00:28:29.593 --> 00:28:30.802
Don’t let me get my hands dirty.

00:28:30.802 --> 00:28:31.881
Damn!

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:33.965
I want to play mobile games too.

00:28:34.473 --> 00:28:36.093
Why do I need to be the first driver?

00:28:36.848 --> 00:28:38.088
Stop complaining.

00:28:38.673 --> 00:28:40.317
I will take the wheel after you.

00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:45.879
Here.

00:28:46.782 --> 00:28:47.565
What?

00:28:47.831 --> 00:28:49.119
Fried chicken.

00:28:51.153 --> 00:28:52.535
I can’t.

00:28:52.535 --> 00:28:53.538
I’m driving.

00:28:53.599 --> 00:28:55.245
Come on. Eat something.

00:28:55.559 --> 00:28:57.559
You haven't eaten all day.

00:28:58.490 --> 00:28:59.524
Fine.

00:29:00.284 --> 00:29:01.701
No sauce.

00:29:03.684 --> 00:29:04.490
Why not?

00:29:04.490 --> 00:29:07.405
You never eat it with the sauce.

00:29:07.702 --> 00:29:12.805
Don’t you know eating with the sauce is an insult to the one who cooks the fried chicken?

00:29:13.870 --> 00:29:18.721
Don't you think eating without the sauce is disrespectful to the one who invented it?

00:29:20.339 --> 00:29:22.925
Some things are just meant to be together.

00:29:23.145 --> 00:29:26.666
If one is missing, the other will be so sad.

00:29:26.666 --> 00:29:27.232
Right?

00:29:32.811 --> 00:29:34.811
Are we still talking about the chicken?

00:29:35.096 --> 00:29:35.777
No.

00:29:44.244 --> 00:29:47.076
I’m talking about the fried chicken and the sauce.

00:29:49.816 --> 00:29:51.365
Fine. I surrender.

00:29:51.606 --> 00:29:52.941
Give it to me.

00:29:56.172 --> 00:29:56.885
Here.

00:29:58.980 --> 00:29:59.843
Oh!

00:30:00.722 --> 00:30:01.565
It’s good.

00:30:02.152 --> 00:30:05.205
I told you they’re meant to be together.

00:30:05.205 --> 00:30:06.541
One more bite.

00:30:19.701 --> 00:30:20.691
Hey.

00:30:21.404 --> 00:30:23.127
Why did you take turns so soon?

00:30:23.641 --> 00:30:25.071
We haven’t even reached halfway yet.

00:30:25.772 --> 00:30:28.081
I know you like to watch the sunset.

00:30:28.478 --> 00:30:30.383
So I’m going fast to get to the camp before that.

00:30:33.309 --> 00:30:35.405
Why do you like to watch the sunset?

00:30:36.101 --> 00:30:37.031
No idea.

00:30:37.815 --> 00:30:38.766
I think…

00:30:39.094 --> 00:30:41.405
no matter how bad the day is

00:30:41.797 --> 00:30:47.314
there’s always a beautiful moment at the end of it.

00:31:06.367 --> 00:31:11.812
♪ Is it you who will turn my world upside down ♪

00:31:11.812 --> 00:31:16.812
♪ Is it you who I’ve been searching for a long time ♪

00:31:16.812 --> 00:31:19.289
♪ Have I found, have I found ♪

00:31:19.289 --> 00:31:26.642
♪ Someone who’s ready to take my hand and walk with me ♪

00:31:26.642 --> 00:31:31.683
♪ Is it you who will not make me cry ♪

00:31:31.683 --> 00:31:37.775
♪ Who will change nightmare into everlasting bright blue sky ♪

00:31:37.775 --> 00:31:47.746
♪ Please say you will never leave my side ♪

00:32:11.444 --> 00:32:13.444
Up, are you alright?

00:32:13.610 --> 00:32:14.484
Damn you, Tun.

00:32:14.685 --> 00:32:16.685
Why did you drive so fast?

00:32:16.685 --> 00:32:17.355
Let me help.

00:32:17.487 --> 00:32:18.965
Don’t pat me or it will come out.

00:32:20.694 --> 00:32:21.563
I almost died.

00:32:21.563 --> 00:32:23.145
Hey. Try this.

00:32:25.314 --> 00:32:27.053
Use it. It helps.

00:32:38.096 --> 00:32:38.906
Wow.

00:32:41.115 --> 00:32:42.305
I’m feeling better.

00:32:42.988 --> 00:32:44.395
I can now go on for a while.

00:32:45.155 --> 00:32:46.152
Thanks.

00:32:50.717 --> 00:32:51.508
Hey!

00:32:51.746 --> 00:32:53.359
What a stunning view.

00:32:55.724 --> 00:32:57.391
It’s worth the carsick.

00:32:57.846 --> 00:32:59.703
Aou, let’s go see it.

00:32:59.703 --> 00:33:00.444
Let’s go.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:08.277
It’s so tiring to drive to see this view.

00:33:14.155 --> 00:33:14.894
Here.

00:33:15.939 --> 00:33:16.844
Better?

00:33:22.473 --> 00:33:23.870
Hey! Wait for me.

00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:27.700
Guys, shooting stars.

00:33:27.927 --> 00:33:30.165
They said it’d happen all night.

00:33:32.427 --> 00:33:34.736
I read this trick on the internet.

00:33:35.445 --> 00:33:41.389
They say, write down 3 wishes that you want to happen this year

00:33:41.756 --> 00:33:43.447
and hang them on the tree.

00:33:43.693 --> 00:33:47.618
The wish that already came true, you can take it down.

00:33:52.436 --> 00:33:53.299
Why are you smiling?

00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:54.459
Hey!

00:33:54.952 --> 00:33:55.837
Don't be nosy.

00:33:57.405 --> 00:33:58.092
Fine.

00:33:58.489 --> 00:33:59.681
Mr. Secretive.

00:33:59.947 --> 00:34:01.519
Keep your secrets to your grave.

00:34:03.690 --> 00:34:04.581
What about you?

00:34:05.032 --> 00:34:06.005
What are your wishes?

00:34:06.554 --> 00:34:07.334
Don’t be nosy.

00:34:08.554 --> 00:34:09.418
Asshole.

00:34:09.957 --> 00:34:11.081
You’re really getting on my nerves.

00:34:14.479 --> 00:34:16.899
It’s easy to guess though.

00:34:18.003 --> 00:34:20.003
You wish to see your portkey soon.

00:34:20.288 --> 00:34:21.113
Right?

00:34:22.756 --> 00:34:24.245
You just know it all.

00:34:26.617 --> 00:34:29.140
What’s your second wish?

00:34:31.892 --> 00:34:36.910
I wish the Romantic Not Comedy project success.

00:34:37.562 --> 00:34:40.679
But I can’t think of the last one right now.

00:34:41.854 --> 00:34:43.445
I will come again when I know it.

00:34:50.735 --> 00:34:52.146
You have only one wish?

00:34:54.166 --> 00:34:55.111
Of course.

00:34:55.426 --> 00:34:57.355
I just want to focus on one wish.

00:34:57.677 --> 00:34:58.791
So that it comes true very soon.

00:35:00.098 --> 00:35:01.269
Sadhu.

00:35:02.196 --> 00:35:02.849
Right.

00:35:03.457 --> 00:35:05.006
Sadhu!

00:35:08.167 --> 00:35:10.167
Cheers!

00:35:10.167 --> 00:35:11.224
Cheers again?

00:35:11.224 --> 00:35:12.734
All right.

00:35:13.333 --> 00:35:14.787
Tess, we need music.

00:35:20.341 --> 00:35:22.341
Wrong lyric!

00:35:22.927 --> 00:35:24.072
Don’t hurt him.

00:35:26.325 --> 00:35:27.446
Sing it again.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000
You just grabbed my drink.

00:35:38.904 --> 00:35:39.608
Hey!

00:35:40.463 --> 00:35:41.925
I love you guys.

00:35:42.405 --> 00:35:43.550
Let me hug you.

00:35:46.081 --> 00:35:47.748
I’m so proud.

00:35:49.855 --> 00:35:51.095
Up.

00:35:52.312 --> 00:35:53.362
Damn it.

00:35:53.552 --> 00:35:55.362
I need to carry you to bed again.

00:35:56.537 --> 00:35:57.468
Get up.

00:35:58.966 --> 00:36:02.083
Normally, those two will not stop fighting.

00:36:03.305 --> 00:36:05.923
But they love each other so much when they’re drunk.

00:36:06.285 --> 00:36:08.285
Do you get along well with them now?

00:36:10.311 --> 00:36:11.836
So well.

00:36:12.081 --> 00:36:13.453
We just click.

00:36:15.615 --> 00:36:20.377
How is it going with you, Fuse and Kita?

00:36:22.683 --> 00:36:23.860
Chaotic.

00:36:25.119 --> 00:36:28.965
But they are both nice.

00:36:30.016 --> 00:36:31.897
It’s not like the only thing they do is cause trouble.

00:36:34.614 --> 00:36:35.489
And…

00:36:36.154 --> 00:36:37.279
us?

00:36:37.978 --> 00:36:38.918
Do we get along well?

00:36:42.411 --> 00:36:43.471
I don’t know.

00:36:45.151 --> 00:36:45.997
What?

00:36:46.971 --> 00:36:49.717
We’ve known each other for a year now.

00:36:50.747 --> 00:36:51.932
How do I explain this?

00:36:54.213 --> 00:36:55.028
Well,

00:36:55.866 --> 00:36:59.085
I like it when I’m with you.

00:37:00.791 --> 00:37:02.088
When we’re apart,

00:37:03.252 --> 00:37:04.644
I’m so lonely.

00:37:06.074 --> 00:37:07.898
But when we’re back together,

00:37:08.965 --> 00:37:10.045
you got me frustrated.

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.417
Yeah.

00:37:14.447 --> 00:37:17.968
I like it so much when you’re frustrated.

00:37:22.695 --> 00:37:24.090
More importantly,

00:37:25.706 --> 00:37:27.784
I like it so much when you sing.

00:37:32.628 --> 00:37:33.965
Can you sing for me again?

00:37:35.481 --> 00:37:36.486
I want to hear it.

00:37:39.884 --> 00:37:40.879
No.

00:37:41.869 --> 00:37:43.227
I’ve been singing all day.

00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:45.485
Your turn now.

00:37:52.624 --> 00:37:53.965
Which song?

00:37:55.726 --> 00:37:57.797
Any song. I like it all.

00:37:59.549 --> 00:38:03.307
Let’s go with the one you sang on the way here.

00:38:04.495 --> 00:38:05.279
It’s nice.

00:38:18.965 --> 00:38:20.133
Wrong chord.

00:38:20.913 --> 00:38:22.723
What? It is right.

00:38:22.947 --> 00:38:23.986
No.

00:38:24.271 --> 00:38:25.683
Different chord.

00:38:26.586 --> 00:38:27.600
Strum again.

00:38:30.523 --> 00:38:32.578
Here. Let me teach you.

00:38:35.727 --> 00:38:36.983
Here.

00:38:38.965 --> 00:38:40.351
Here.

00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:44.346
And here.

00:38:46.146 --> 00:38:47.082
Now play it.

00:38:50.171 --> 00:38:51.069
Again.

00:38:54.078 --> 00:38:55.318
That’s right.

00:39:49.395 --> 00:39:50.133
This time,

00:39:51.772 --> 00:39:53.200
I can kiss you, can’t I?

00:39:59.091 --> 00:40:01.091
What if it reaches 3 times

00:40:02.348 --> 00:40:03.706
and I can still take more?

00:40:04.689 --> 00:40:07.045
If that friend of yours makes you feel that uneasy,

00:40:08.966 --> 00:40:10.405
I think you should back off.

00:40:15.481 --> 00:40:19.168
Are you asking me or asking yourself?

00:40:42.317 --> 00:40:45.165
What about finding the portkey?

00:40:45.264 --> 00:40:46.504
Good.

00:40:46.979 --> 00:40:48.171
If you ask me,

00:40:48.583 --> 00:40:51.011
I think Tun is your portkey.

00:42:59.612 --> 00:43:01.060
We don’t have a meeting today.

00:43:01.394 --> 00:43:03.135
Why don’t you come inside?

00:43:04.529 --> 00:43:05.364
I…

00:43:06.529 --> 00:43:07.280
I…

00:43:09.569 --> 00:43:11.845
I think I’ll withdraw from Friend Credits.

00:43:12.287 --> 00:43:13.173
Huh?

00:43:13.467 --> 00:43:14.417
Why?

00:43:16.224 --> 00:43:17.616
If it’s about last night--

00:43:17.616 --> 00:43:18.542
These days…

00:43:20.035 --> 00:43:22.311
I’ve been spending all my time working on our screenplay.

00:43:24.055 --> 00:43:25.762
If I’m still on the team,

00:43:27.878 --> 00:43:30.464
I won’t have time to find my portkey.

00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:39.873
No, Talay.

00:43:41.611 --> 00:43:42.936
What about our movie?

00:43:43.611 --> 00:43:45.135
You guys are great.

00:43:45.968 --> 00:43:49.985
Besides, you have Pang to help you.

00:43:50.819 --> 00:43:52.847
She should be able to help with the screenplay

00:43:53.867 --> 00:43:56.447
and take you back home.

00:43:58.209 --> 00:43:59.905
Are you really leaving me?

00:44:01.869 --> 00:44:04.863
Leaving Up and Aou?

00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:10.215
Leaving our movie?

00:44:10.215 --> 00:44:12.415
You’re the one who is leaving me.

00:44:15.861 --> 00:44:18.496
If Pang happens to be your portkey,

00:44:21.747 --> 00:44:24.631
I don’t want to be left alone here.

00:44:32.561 --> 00:44:34.036
I’ve thought it through.

00:44:35.771 --> 00:44:37.080
About the movie,

00:44:40.313 --> 00:44:42.313
you can always give me a call.

00:44:53.752 --> 00:44:56.083
So I really have to let you go?

00:44:57.524 --> 00:45:00.546
It’s time we split up and find our way home.

00:45:24.831 --> 00:45:28.903
This is the latest draft from my team.

00:45:30.314 --> 00:45:32.314
I’d like you to read it first.

00:45:34.369 --> 00:45:39.739
But if you have any comments, please contact Tun directly.

00:45:41.617 --> 00:45:42.501
Why?

00:45:45.292 --> 00:45:48.065
Because I withdrew from this project.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.428
Good then.

00:45:52.481 --> 00:45:57.962
Because I was about to tell you that our company

00:45:58.886 --> 00:46:02.267
will not do the “Romantic Not Comedy” project anymore.

00:46:05.431 --> 00:46:06.775
Why not?

00:46:07.423 --> 00:46:09.135
Please read this draft first.

00:46:09.742 --> 00:46:12.957
I think they’ve improved a lot.

00:46:17.262 --> 00:46:18.433
I get you.

00:46:19.541 --> 00:46:22.812
But the board doesn’t trust you guys.

00:46:24.044 --> 00:46:26.458
They’re afraid it’d be a failure like the last time.

00:46:30.022 --> 00:46:31.488
I can’t help you.

00:46:49.544 --> 00:46:52.055
Thanks for sharing the stories.

00:46:52.231 --> 00:46:56.192
Let’s take a 15-minute break.

00:47:06.446 --> 00:47:08.059
How are you holding up, Dol?

00:47:08.482 --> 00:47:09.695
Are you okay?

00:47:11.093 --> 00:47:12.292
I’ve been better.

00:47:12.667 --> 00:47:14.004
How are you?

00:47:14.004 --> 00:47:15.314
You just went on a trip with Tun, didn’t you?

00:47:17.289 --> 00:47:18.488
Good.

00:47:19.347 --> 00:47:21.706
Unforgettable memory.

00:47:23.145 --> 00:47:26.001
What about finding the portkey?

00:47:26.406 --> 00:47:29.179
Is it clear now that it’s Tun?

00:47:29.415 --> 00:47:30.113
What?

00:47:31.562 --> 00:47:34.225
Must be some misunderstanding here.

00:47:34.916 --> 00:47:35.788
What?

00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.758
You guys just went on a trip together.

00:47:37.758 --> 00:47:39.893
I thought it was a honeymoon trip.

00:47:40.376 --> 00:47:44.696
You just wait for the sign that says you guys truly match.

00:47:44.696 --> 00:47:45.319
Ding!

00:47:45.319 --> 00:47:46.084
Go home.

00:47:46.484 --> 00:47:47.821
No.

00:47:48.598 --> 00:47:51.135
Tun is Pang’s portkey.

00:47:51.975 --> 00:47:53.229
No way.

00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:55.775
Pang keeps coming to meet new people here.

00:47:55.775 --> 00:47:57.129
She is just next door.

00:48:03.362 --> 00:48:05.003
What happened?

00:48:06.304 --> 00:48:10.210
You and Tun seem to be each other’s portkeys.

00:48:19.733 --> 00:48:21.374
I thought so too at first.

00:48:23.007 --> 00:48:24.943
But after spending one day with him,

00:48:26.076 --> 00:48:27.438
I knew we weren't.

00:48:28.654 --> 00:48:29.853
Why?

00:48:30.325 --> 00:48:35.474
Because Tun seems happy when he’s with you.

00:48:36.447 --> 00:48:42.977
Can you believe that the only thing he talked about when he was with me was you?

00:48:47.559 --> 00:48:49.034
What’s the matter?

00:48:49.175 --> 00:48:51.175
Why do you look so serious?

00:48:52.114 --> 00:48:55.215
Do you think we’re each other’s portkeys?

00:48:57.412 --> 00:48:58.815
Why would you ask that?

00:48:59.221 --> 00:49:00.530
It’s Talay.

00:49:00.738 --> 00:49:03.511
He believes we’re each other’s portkeys.

00:49:05.548 --> 00:49:11.167
Because I told him it felt special when we first met.

00:49:13.003 --> 00:49:15.135
I felt you’re special too.

00:49:15.736 --> 00:49:22.415
But that specialness was just a surprise that you’re someone I know.

00:49:22.608 --> 00:49:26.480
It’s like when you run into your friend when you’re abroad.

00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:27.757
Something like that.

00:49:27.802 --> 00:49:29.222
Same here.

00:49:31.588 --> 00:49:33.781
I just don’t know how to explain this to Talay.

00:49:35.414 --> 00:49:37.895
He wants us to spend more time together.

00:49:38.696 --> 00:49:39.691
For what?

00:49:40.701 --> 00:49:42.495
For me to go home as soon as possible.

00:49:46.792 --> 00:49:48.655
I don’t want things to go this way.

00:49:49.043 --> 00:49:51.043
I want him to smile like he used to do.

00:49:52.482 --> 00:49:54.482
Smile for every little thing.

00:49:56.257 --> 00:49:58.008
Smile like he did before.

00:50:00.028 --> 00:50:06.116
Because Talay’s smile is your smile, Puen.

00:50:07.029 --> 00:50:11.018
You have no idea you always smile when you talk about him.

00:50:11.018 --> 00:50:17.979
It’s the smile I’ve never seen whether it’s when you’re Puen or you’re with other people.

00:50:19.961 --> 00:50:22.983
Smiles don’t lie.

00:50:31.635 --> 00:50:33.812
When I saw Tun looking happier,

00:50:34.724 --> 00:50:36.615
I wanted it too.

00:50:37.843 --> 00:50:40.948
Someone who makes me smile every day.

00:50:42.138 --> 00:50:46.762
If I ever find that person and we go back together, that’d be so nice.

00:50:51.016 --> 00:50:52.602
I’m sure you’ll find that person.

00:50:53.237 --> 00:50:54.415
I believe so.

00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:05.897
If you ask me,

00:51:08.911 --> 00:51:11.491
I think Tun is your portkey.

00:51:14.031 --> 00:51:16.694
Thank you so much for today.

00:51:16.774 --> 00:51:20.376
Sorry to bother you. I couldn’t find a helper in time.

00:51:20.491 --> 00:51:22.491
You missed the movie with your friends, didn’t you?

00:51:23.923 --> 00:51:25.655
That’s totally fine. Happy to help.

00:51:30.687 --> 00:51:31.856
Wow!

00:51:32.049 --> 00:51:33.415
Nice colors.

00:51:33.845 --> 00:51:39.135
There are blue, orange, light blue, and pink.

00:51:39.851 --> 00:51:41.713
What should I call this tone of color?

00:51:43.481 --> 00:51:44.392
Talay.

00:51:46.385 --> 00:51:47.501
Talay.

00:51:48.236 --> 00:51:49.601
Sea Palette.

00:51:50.415 --> 00:51:51.304
Hey!

00:51:51.774 --> 00:51:52.885
No.

00:51:53.522 --> 00:51:58.655
I mean, don't you get into the habit of naming Pantone after Talay?

00:52:00.868 --> 00:52:03.615
Of course, there’s only one person with this weird habit.

00:52:04.659 --> 00:52:05.701
You know what?

00:52:06.944 --> 00:52:09.559
If you unknowingly adopt a habit from someone close,

00:52:09.968 --> 00:52:13.846
it suggests you like that habit.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:17.966
Bye now.

00:52:18.629 --> 00:52:19.725
See you.

00:52:28.838 --> 00:52:32.827
I can feel Tun is thinking the same thing.

00:52:38.181 --> 00:52:40.181
Aou, are you with Tun?

00:52:40.181 --> 00:52:41.460
I can’t reach him.

00:52:41.718 --> 00:52:43.083
(Me neither.)

00:52:43.263 --> 00:52:45.926
(This morning your brother Tanin called and told us the news.)

00:52:46.007 --> 00:52:47.206
(Tun rushed out.)

00:52:47.206 --> 00:52:48.656
(He said he’d talk to your dad.)

00:52:48.656 --> 00:52:50.722
(He won’t pick up my calls.)

00:52:50.722 --> 00:52:51.624
Okay.

00:52:51.624 --> 00:52:52.561
I need to hang up now.

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:56.383
Let me through.

00:52:56.383 --> 00:52:58.158
Don’t you get it? You can’t go inside.

00:52:58.158 --> 00:52:59.412
Don’t do this.

00:52:59.667 --> 00:53:01.336
I’ll do anything with you.

00:53:01.559 --> 00:53:03.135
Whatever you do.

00:53:03.658 --> 00:53:07.426
If you’re making a movie, I’m making a movie.

00:53:11.927 --> 00:53:13.135
Let me in.

00:53:13.135 --> 00:53:13.769
You can’t.

00:53:13.769 --> 00:53:14.935
Let me through.

00:53:17.895 --> 00:53:19.425
I’ve been waiting all day.

00:53:19.425 --> 00:53:20.795
I said you can’t.

00:53:24.320 --> 00:53:25.629
Why don’t you get it?

00:53:28.254 --> 00:53:29.370
Do as I said.

00:53:29.370 --> 00:53:31.158
Go home if you don’t want to get hurt.

00:53:46.126 --> 00:53:51.015
Because I know movies are what you want to do the most, Talay.

00:54:08.161 --> 00:54:09.609
Why are you doing this?

00:54:16.983 --> 00:54:17.878
Why?

00:54:19.676 --> 00:54:21.135
Just because I want to make movies.

00:54:22.449 --> 00:54:24.215
So you’ve gone out of your way to do this.

00:54:27.822 --> 00:54:31.010
Because it’s the only thing I get to do with you.

00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.375
Why are you so attached to me?

00:54:42.365 --> 00:54:43.536
Because I believe

00:54:45.390 --> 00:54:47.390
you’re my portkey.

00:54:51.192 --> 00:54:57.295
The only reason I spent time with Pang is that I wanted you to be happy.

00:54:59.210 --> 00:55:00.851
That night, why did you…?

00:55:04.863 --> 00:55:05.720
This time,

00:55:07.405 --> 00:55:08.907
I can kiss you, can’t I?

00:55:10.037 --> 00:55:13.935
Are you asking me or asking yourself?

00:55:19.110 --> 00:55:22.933
Because I didn’t know if you’re gonna let me love you.

00:55:25.636 --> 00:55:28.133
I want us to be each other’s portkeys.

00:55:30.798 --> 00:55:33.135
I don’t want you to look for anyone else.

00:55:38.194 --> 00:55:39.900
Please don’t ask me to leave you again,

00:55:40.673 --> 00:55:41.740
Talay.

00:55:52.643 --> 00:55:53.814
I’m sorry.

00:55:55.668 --> 00:55:57.668
We even made a promise.

00:56:04.950 --> 00:56:07.143
(We will go back together.)

00:56:14.560 --> 00:56:16.118
I will go back with you.

00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:52.708
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

00:56:52.983 --> 00:56:55.701
Chang has a series project until next year.

00:56:55.701 --> 00:56:56.981
We have no directors.

00:56:56.981 --> 00:56:58.433
I’ll show you my directing skills.

00:56:58.598 --> 00:57:02.055
Let’s suppose this is a scene where you’re thinking of someone you like.

00:57:02.055 --> 00:57:03.872
My brother sent me a contact of someone.

00:57:03.872 --> 00:57:05.942
He just graduated from abroad.

00:57:05.942 --> 00:57:07.720
He’s definitely asking you on a date.

00:57:08.191 --> 00:57:10.025
I don’t like people for their appearances.

00:57:12.291 --> 00:57:15.479
I've never even seen your real face,

00:57:16.093 --> 00:57:17.706
yet I like you.
