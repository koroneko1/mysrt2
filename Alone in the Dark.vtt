[Cheyenne] I don't know.

00:30.397 --> 00:32.365
[laughs]

00:34.367 --> 00:37.137
No, absolutely not.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.605
Because I'm in the middle of working out!

00:38.671 --> 00:42.308
I'm not gonna just hurry over there every time you call.

00:44.244 --> 00:47.247
No, I actually ended up walking most of it.

00:47.313 --> 00:49.783
Turns out, I hate running.

00:49.849 --> 00:53.753
So, yeah, let me finish up with this, uh, not run

00:53.820 --> 00:55.755
and I'll call you when I'm done.

00:55.822 --> 00:57.290
Bye.

-[Bri] Hey! -[horn honking]

04:03.776 --> 04:07.313
-No, no. no. -Hey! Get away from him!

04:07.380 --> 04:09.048
Sorry, I was just...

04:11.284 --> 04:13.653
[ankle monitor beeping]

04:16.489 --> 04:19.292
On the first day, Ms. Collins?

[birds chirping]

04:30.970 --> 04:33.506
[dramatic music]

04:55.295 --> 04:56.562
You got me a fish?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.498
It's a house arrest warming gift.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.933
I know you don't like to be alone, so...

05:03.069 --> 05:05.038
[Bri] Way to go.

05:05.104 --> 05:09.909
Bri, you live in a multimillion dollar lake front home.

05:09.976 --> 05:11.878
You have a wine cellar.

05:11.944 --> 05:15.448
Most people would kill for a life like this.

05:15.515 --> 05:17.417
I know you weren't a big fan of the plea deal.

05:17.483 --> 05:20.153
-Because I'm innocent. -Of course you are.

05:20.219 --> 05:23.122
But convincing a jury is a another story.

05:23.189 --> 05:24.390
I've been a lawyer a while,

05:24.457 --> 05:27.126
and I've seen how these things can go.

05:27.193 --> 05:30.596
A year of house arrest is getting off easy.

05:30.663 --> 05:33.032
You could be where Michael is right now.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.403
Mm.

05:37.470 --> 05:40.006
Mm. I know we didn't have a choice.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.742
I didn't just hire you because you were my friend.

05:46.546 --> 05:51.451
I hired you because you are a good lawyer.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.387
Plus, if I were in jail,

05:54.454 --> 05:56.889
who would drink all of Michael's fancy wine?

05:56.956 --> 05:59.025
Ehh, there she is.

05:59.092 --> 06:02.462
This is a 2005

06:02.528 --> 06:05.131
from the blah-blah-blah region of Germany.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.834
Now, the interesting thing about this vintage

06:07.900 --> 06:11.104
is that it's guaranteed to get you drunk.

06:11.170 --> 06:14.841
-Pinky up, bitch. Be classy. -Oh, yes.

06:14.907 --> 06:17.710
Mm. Earthy.

06:17.777 --> 06:20.179
I'm getting hints of Elder flower.

06:20.246 --> 06:21.214
Ah.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.849
Oh, and a little younger flower.

06:22.915 --> 06:24.550
[chuckles]

06:25.852 --> 06:27.286
Ah, you wanna stay tonight?

06:27.353 --> 06:30.490
We can have a slumber party like we did in college.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.992
Face masks and manicures

06:33.059 --> 06:34.594
and nicer wine.

06:34.660 --> 06:36.662
I wish. I can't.

06:36.729 --> 06:38.164
Court in the morning.

06:39.665 --> 06:43.202
This place just gets so creepy at night.

06:43.269 --> 06:44.537
You'll be fine.

06:44.604 --> 06:46.973
You have a whole year to get used to it.

06:48.708 --> 06:51.177
What are you gonna do with all that time anyway?

Hello.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.225
What do you mean my signal went out?

07:07.693 --> 07:11.364
Okay. I'll head upstairs right now.

07:11.431 --> 07:12.965
Thank you.

[woman clears throat]

07:38.991 --> 07:40.593
Ms. Collins.

07:42.528 --> 07:44.130
Your electronic monitoring device

07:44.197 --> 07:45.932
is the property of the State of California.

07:45.998 --> 07:47.733
Removing or tampering with the device

07:47.800 --> 07:49.869
will activate the internal microphone

07:49.936 --> 07:52.071
and will result in additional legal charges.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.308
It's your responsibility to stay within the allowed perimeter

07:55.374 --> 07:58.311
and keep the monitor charged at all times.

07:58.377 --> 08:00.146
I remember, Nancy.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.817
-Do you want a cup of coffee? -No.

08:04.884 --> 08:08.354
-It'll only take a second. -No, thank you. I'm fine.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.590
House, start coffee.

08:12.291 --> 08:16.028

08:16.095 --> 08:19.031
[automated message] Coffee will be ready in two minutes.

08:19.098 --> 08:22.668
Ever get used to the Smart House thing?

08:22.735 --> 08:24.403
I'm trying.

08:24.470 --> 08:27.306
It always seems to like my ex-husband more than me.

08:27.373 --> 08:28.774
Do you want sugar?

08:28.841 --> 08:30.910
-Ms. Collins-- -Bri.

08:30.977 --> 08:37.016
Bri. I know you've been feeling restless the last few months.

08:37.083 --> 08:41.120
Most people take online classes, or learn a new skill.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.022
Is there anything that you're working towards?

08:43.089 --> 08:45.391
Not trying to brag, but I have become

08:45.458 --> 08:48.794
the best at binge-watching reality dating shows.

08:50.429 --> 08:51.797
Mm.

08:55.668 --> 08:58.504
I'd like to go back to school.

08:58.571 --> 08:59.972
Finish my MBA.

09:00.973 --> 09:03.476
Are you socializing at all?

09:03.543 --> 09:05.478
Haven't you heard?

09:05.545 --> 09:09.248
I'm the pariah at Sandpoint Lake.

09:09.315 --> 09:12.118
Bringing down property values in a single bound.

09:13.519 --> 09:15.621
Also I, I have a fish,

09:15.688 --> 09:19.292
so my social life is basically perfect.

09:19.358 --> 09:21.561
I've had to dispatch the police

09:21.627 --> 09:23.362
repeatedly the last three months.

09:23.429 --> 09:26.032
I-I know. It's just the signal on this thing--

09:26.098 --> 09:28.668
Is that something that's going to continue?

09:33.439 --> 09:35.908
-No. -Good.

09:35.975 --> 09:39.145
Any contact with your ex-husband?

09:39.211 --> 09:40.346
No.

09:42.682 --> 09:45.051
But he does call every day.

09:45.117 --> 09:47.787
He is not permitted to call anyone who's not on his list.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.756
Well, I'll just let him know the next time he calls.

09:54.994 --> 09:56.896
Are you sure you can't stay?

09:56.963 --> 09:59.632
I will see you again next month.

09:59.699 --> 10:02.168
I don't wanna hear from you until then.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.805
"Love Island."

10:05.871 --> 10:09.408
If you're looking for the best trashy dating show,

10:09.475 --> 10:11.777

I think somebody was in the house.

13:15.661 --> 13:17.196
Oh, my god.

13:17.263 --> 13:18.297
Yeah.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.132
And the alarm didn't even go off.

13:20.199 --> 13:23.602
Michael is the only other person that has access to it.

13:23.669 --> 13:26.438
Honey, he can't break into your house from jail.

13:27.773 --> 13:30.075
Is that a stun gun?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.879
Got it online.

13:33.946 --> 13:35.915
Look, I know you didn't wanna call the police.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.450
I'm not on good terms with them.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.620
They're always coming here to check the stupid monitor.

13:41.687 --> 13:42.721
[both gasp]

13:42.788 --> 13:44.089
[sighs]

13:44.156 --> 13:48.227
Well, I called them for you. Just in case.

13:51.630 --> 13:55.501
Huh. I'm sorry to give you ladies a scare.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.203
I'm Detective Joe Hall.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.939
I'm with the County Sheriff's Department.

14:00.005 --> 14:02.508
Hi, I'm Bri. I live here.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.043
This is my friend Sofia.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.545
She's the one that called about the disturbance.

14:06.612 --> 14:09.114
-You live here, too? -No. Just visiting.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.183
Is there a man in the house?

14:12.551 --> 14:15.321
So it's only you, all alone here?

14:18.357 --> 14:19.625
Hey.

14:21.460 --> 14:23.896
I know you. Aren't you Michael Miller's wife?

14:23.963 --> 14:25.130
Ex-wife.

14:25.197 --> 14:26.165
You know, he pissed a lot

14:26.232 --> 14:27.566
of people off with what he did.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.069
A couple guys in our department lost everything.

14:30.135 --> 14:32.471
Well, good thing I am not him.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.608
[laughs] Right.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.913
So, why don't you walk me through what happened?

14:42.948 --> 14:45.050
[door creaks]

14:56.495 --> 14:59.798
Graduation photo. What school?

14:59.865 --> 15:02.468
USC. Cross country scholarship.

15:02.534 --> 15:04.136
Mm. Impressive.

15:07.039 --> 15:10.109
Any security cameras in the house?

15:10.175 --> 15:13.879
No. My ex refused.

15:13.946 --> 15:15.981
This is our vacation home.

15:16.048 --> 15:17.449
He wanted privacy.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.719
Is anything missing? Stolen?

15:20.786 --> 15:22.388
I don't think so.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.064
Are you sure you didn't leave that open?

15:32.131 --> 15:33.465
Breeze could have knocked that over.

15:33.532 --> 15:36.535
You think she's going to leave a door open?

15:36.602 --> 15:39.772
Like you said, it is just her, all alone here.

15:39.838 --> 15:41.807
Well, you know, these houses on the water,

15:41.874 --> 15:44.143
they settle every now and again.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.314
It wasn't, because the house is on the water--

15:48.380 --> 15:49.381
Unless a crime has been committed,

15:49.448 --> 15:51.450
there isn't much we can do.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.852
I can fill out a report, and I'm happy to do that,

15:53.919 --> 15:55.754
if that's what you'd like...

15:58.924 --> 16:01.827
But, if anything else happens...

16:01.894 --> 16:03.696
give me a call, personally.

16:07.499 --> 16:10.469
Oh, and keep those doors closed.

16:11.870 --> 16:15.140
[growls] What an asshole!

16:15.207 --> 16:19.178
Ugh, cops can be so useless sometimes.

16:19.244 --> 16:22.915
Look, I'll stay the night, we'll get some wine,

16:22.982 --> 16:24.717
try and forget about this.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.587
Get the cabernet!

16:34.493 --> 16:35.661
Sofia?

16:37.129 --> 16:38.297
[Sofia screams]

16:38.364 --> 16:40.265
Sofia! Are you okay?

16:42.034 --> 16:45.404
Ohh, look what I found.

16:45.471 --> 16:47.573
That's one of Michael's favorites.

16:50.809 --> 16:52.378
Do it.

16:52.444 --> 16:55.180
Huh, speaking of Michael's favorites...

16:57.216 --> 16:59.385
look what I found under the couch.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.054
They aren't mine.

17:02.121 --> 17:05.324
Ew. Do you think--

17:05.391 --> 17:07.826
That Michael brought other women over to cheat on me

17:07.893 --> 17:09.528
without me knowing?

17:09.595 --> 17:13.599
Why, yes, I'm beginning to suspect it. Ugh.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.402
Probably why he never installed cameras.

17:17.803 --> 17:19.138
That's enough.

17:19.204 --> 17:22.241
We're cleansing the whole damn place.

17:25.477 --> 17:29.081
-Is that all Michael's stuff? -Everything flammable.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.050
Ashes to ashes.

17:31.116 --> 17:32.851
Dust to dust.

17:36.622 --> 17:37.723
[sighs]

17:37.790 --> 17:38.957
How did that feel?

17:39.024 --> 17:42.628
Good. Really, really good.

17:42.694 --> 17:45.364
Can I do one? Give me a little taste.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.735
Damn, this is nice.

17:49.802 --> 17:51.070
Yep. Just toss it in.

17:51.136 --> 17:54.139
I'm just saying, the man had good taste.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.208
He did pick you.

17:56.275 --> 17:58.510
Ohh, screw you, Michael!

17:58.577 --> 18:00.145
Yeah.

[groans]

18:08.153 --> 18:09.288
Kill me.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.723
I'm so puffy.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.659
[sighs] Thank you.

18:15.160 --> 18:17.196
I'm never drinking again.

18:20.566 --> 18:22.668
At least not until later tonight.

18:24.736 --> 18:28.507
-Sofia. -Hey, I'm not judging.

18:29.441 --> 18:31.677
No, Sofia. Come here.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.785
[suspenseful music]

18:48.093 --> 18:51.363
Someone left this picture of me the first day I was here.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.732
Then my house got broken into.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.667
And now all of this.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.669
It gotta have something to do with Michael.

18:57.736 --> 19:00.205
Michael? How does that make sense?

19:00.272 --> 19:02.074
Maybe he hired someone. I don't know.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.976
-He has a lot of friends. -And a lot of enemies.

19:04.042 --> 19:07.212
Could be someone trying to get back at him through you.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.047
It's comforting.

19:09.114 --> 19:10.883
What am I supposed to do?

19:10.949 --> 19:12.417
Should I call the police again?

19:12.484 --> 19:14.753
I don't know, they weren't exactly helpful yesterday.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.488
So, then what? What?

19:16.555 --> 19:18.624
Do I get murdered and then call the police, Sofia?

19:18.690 --> 19:21.860
Jesus, Bri. Let's not jump straight to murder.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.397
Take a deep breath.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.000
[exhales]

19:28.066 --> 19:31.136
Um, I'm, I'm not trying to say this to scare you,

19:31.203 --> 19:34.039
but all this, the photos,

19:34.106 --> 19:35.574

19:35.641 --> 19:38.177
Whoever's doing this is toying with you.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.179
This is a game to them.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.413
Well, I don't wanna play.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.681
Your only other option is to leave

19:42.748 --> 19:45.317
and you're kind of stuck here.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.119
So, what do I do?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.087
How do I win?

19:49.154 --> 19:50.522
You write your own rules.

19:50.589 --> 19:51.957
Take control of the situation.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.892
What, take control?

19:53.959 --> 19:55.460
What does that mean, buy a gun?

19:55.527 --> 19:59.731
Ew. No. Hire one.

19:59.798 --> 20:02.000
Have you considered personal security?

20:03.802 --> 20:06.371
[scoffs] If the cops can't help,

20:06.438 --> 20:08.307
what's a rent-a-cop gonna do?

20:08.373 --> 20:10.509
He's there to keep you safe.

20:10.576 --> 20:12.444
Give him a chance.

20:12.511 --> 20:13.912
He worked for a client a few months back.

20:13.979 --> 20:16.415
The man is good at what he does.

20:16.481 --> 20:19.251
Think about it. You gotta protect yourself.

[crickets chirping]

20:42.307 --> 20:43.875
Yes.

20:46.945 --> 20:48.814
-Michael? -I'm so glad you answered.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.917
-How are you? -Why are you keep calling me?

20:51.984 --> 20:54.853
To make sure you're all right. I've been worried about you.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.290
Have you been watching me?

20:58.357 --> 21:00.559
Why would I need to do that?

21:00.626 --> 21:03.729
I know exactly where you are. And for how long.

21:03.795 --> 21:06.331
I bet you're in the bed room at the lake house right now.

21:07.699 --> 21:11.003
How many bottles of my wine have you gone through?

21:11.069 --> 21:14.773
I wanted you to know, I'm being released.

21:14.840 --> 21:19.077
What? You've only been in jail three months. How?

21:19.144 --> 21:21.513
Good behavior.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.081
You remember Judge Gettman.

21:23.148 --> 21:26.418
I spoke with him and, uh, we both decided

21:26.485 --> 21:28.487
I've paid my debt to society.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.691
I'd love to see you.

21:47.439 --> 21:49.007
Hey.

21:50.475 --> 21:51.510
Bri Collins?

21:51.576 --> 21:53.712
You must be Xavier.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.181
Thank you for the house call.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.783
I'm here to accommodate.

21:57.849 --> 21:59.584
Wanna run me through what's going on?

22:01.286 --> 22:02.854
Can we talk in the back?

22:05.257 --> 22:06.658
You mind?

22:08.360 --> 22:10.429
Help yourself.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.531
So you need some, uh, personal security?

22:14.499 --> 22:17.302
Uh, yeah. Somebody has been watching me.

22:17.369 --> 22:19.905
And now they're letting me know that they're watching me.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.407
You have any idea who's doing that?

22:22.474 --> 22:24.743
My ex, Michael Miller.

22:26.044 --> 22:27.713
Michael Miller.

22:29.915 --> 22:31.216
Michael Miller that went to prison

22:31.283 --> 22:33.452
for the pump and dump scheme.

22:39.524 --> 22:41.460
Have you contacted the police?

22:42.260 --> 22:44.096
Yep.

22:44.162 --> 22:47.733
They won't help me. At least not yet.

22:50.235 --> 22:51.203
Sounds about right.

22:51.269 --> 22:52.270
I have nine months left

22:52.337 --> 22:53.739
until my sentence is up.

22:53.805 --> 22:56.508
I just need some security to keep an eye on me,

22:56.575 --> 22:58.143
make sure I'm safe.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.680
So, can you help me?

23:04.950 --> 23:07.018
Nah, I'm good.

23:07.085 --> 23:08.487
You're good?

23:08.553 --> 23:12.157
Yeah. I'm good.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.693
-Are you serious? -Thanks for calling.

23:15.994 --> 23:17.496
Good luck.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.464
And thanks for the apple.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.466
-Are you serious? -Yeah.

23:21.533 --> 23:24.069
Look, I'm not a prison guard.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.138
Sittin' around here guardin' you for nine months

23:26.204 --> 23:28.206
is not exactly my dream job.

23:29.674 --> 23:31.209
I understand.

23:31.276 --> 23:34.913
It's honestly probably too dangerous for you, anyway.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.649
I need someone who knows how to handle themselves.

23:38.984 --> 23:41.153
Plus, you're a little bit on the skinny side.

23:43.655 --> 23:46.525
-Are you actually doing this? -Do what?

23:48.093 --> 23:50.562
Tryin' to appeal to...

23:50.629 --> 23:53.365
fragile point in my masculinity

23:53.432 --> 23:55.400
to win me over.

23:55.467 --> 23:58.136
Mm. Is it working?

23:59.304 --> 24:00.705
No.

24:01.907 --> 24:05.777
Okay, fine. I will pay you double.

24:05.844 --> 24:07.712
Whatever you're making on another job,

24:07.779 --> 24:10.248
I-I will beat that.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.655
You really think your ex-husband will go this far?

24:16.721 --> 24:18.423
He's the smartest man I know.

24:18.490 --> 24:21.159
He's also the most vindictive.

24:21.226 --> 24:25.564
Through the years, he had me sign things for taxes

24:25.630 --> 24:29.167
and retirement, or so he told me.

24:29.234 --> 24:32.070
I trusted and loved my husband.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.606
In return, he built a mountain of evidence

24:34.673 --> 24:35.974
linking me to his crimes.

24:36.041 --> 24:39.077
When he was arrested and I finally left him,

24:39.144 --> 24:41.346
he blackmailed me.

24:41.413 --> 24:43.615
Trying to make me stay.

24:44.616 --> 24:46.918
I didn't.

24:46.985 --> 24:50.555
So then, he took me down with him as an aider and abider.

24:50.622 --> 24:52.524
Was he ever violent you?

24:56.828 --> 25:01.366
Still, you shouldn't, uh, shouldn't close the door

25:01.433 --> 25:03.068
on any other possibilities.

25:03.134 --> 25:07.138
Who else will be stalking me? And why?

25:07.205 --> 25:10.675
I don't know. It could be anybody at this point.

25:10.742 --> 25:14.179
But I do know that there's another young lady

25:14.246 --> 25:17.816
around your age that went missing around here.

25:17.883 --> 25:21.286
I remember reading about this. They never found her?

25:21.353 --> 25:22.854
Yeah.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.325
So you think that might have something to do with

25:27.392 --> 25:28.593
what's happening to me?

25:28.660 --> 25:31.329
I don't know.

25:31.396 --> 25:33.532
I sure hope not.

25:33.598 --> 25:35.267
No.

25:35.333 --> 25:36.735
No.

25:36.801 --> 25:38.837
It has to be Michael.

25:38.904 --> 25:40.639
I've been saying this from the start

25:40.705 --> 25:43.308
and nobody is listening to me.

25:43.375 --> 25:47.746
Michael has put me through hell for years.

25:47.812 --> 25:49.681
I hear you.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.852
When Cheyenne went missing,

25:53.919 --> 25:57.289
police never found any evidence of a crime.

25:57.355 --> 26:00.158
They said she was an adult and that she could just leave

26:00.225 --> 26:01.826
whenever she wanted to without notice.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.963
My point is, I'm listening.

26:05.030 --> 26:07.232
I hear you and I'll believe you.

26:08.500 --> 26:11.036
And I'll do whatever I can to keep you safe.

We'll send you a bill for the ankle monitor.

Keep in touch.

A little shaken up, but I'm fine.

28:15.260 --> 28:17.028
Any idea what happened with the boat water?

28:17.095 --> 28:20.498
Xavier's looking into it, but no, not yet.

28:20.565 --> 28:22.500

28:24.936 --> 28:27.005
Nice to have a bodyguard around.

28:29.674 --> 28:32.777
Especially one as fit as he is.

28:33.645 --> 28:35.580
That's not even on my mind.

28:35.647 --> 28:39.217
And he hasn't even looked at me twice since he's been here.

28:39.284 --> 28:43.855
Maybe you'd feel better if you cleaned up a little bit.

I don't think death threats really are a turn on.

Mm, see, that's where you and I will have to disagree.

I wanted to see if there was something

29:23.995 --> 29:26.998
that pointed back to what started the fire.

29:27.065 --> 29:30.869
Mm, you know how to disassemble boat motors?

29:31.970 --> 29:35.406
Yeah. Looks like impeller failure.

29:35.473 --> 29:39.477
That'd make sense with a T-shirt blocking the water intake.

29:39.544 --> 29:41.813

31:46.271 --> 31:49.841
-All over. -How about this?

31:49.908 --> 31:52.710
If I guess something right about you,

31:52.777 --> 31:54.078
you take a step closer.

31:54.145 --> 31:56.314
And if you guess something right about me,

31:56.381 --> 31:58.816
I'll take one step towards you.

31:58.883 --> 32:01.786
If I win, you will relax and eat.

I didn't know people in Phoenix had an accent.

You moved to Sandpoint because you were running from something.

No, lower-middle class.

32:45.363 --> 32:47.365
Ouch.

32:47.432 --> 32:52.036
You're an only child, going by your social skills.

32:53.204 --> 32:55.173
You have a sister.

32:55.239 --> 32:57.442
You're definitely the older one.

33:00.178 --> 33:02.246
You played football in high-school.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.249
You're athletic.

33:06.684 --> 33:08.119
Runner.

33:12.156 --> 33:15.760
Okay. I win.

33:15.827 --> 33:17.295
Have your meal.

33:21.866 --> 33:25.436
You can really tell all of that just by looking at me?

33:25.503 --> 33:26.637
Nah.

33:28.139 --> 33:31.142
-I Googled you. -Come on, that's not fair.

33:31.209 --> 33:33.011
I'm not here to be fair.

33:33.077 --> 33:34.746
I'm here to protect you.

33:34.812 --> 33:37.281
Which I am very grateful for.

33:37.348 --> 33:39.050
I'm not the most intimidating person.

33:39.117 --> 33:41.219
Look, let me show you something.

33:43.888 --> 33:46.557
Ju-Jitsu, it's like human chess.

33:47.959 --> 33:49.794
You know Ju-Jitsu, too?

33:49.861 --> 33:51.329
Yeah.

33:52.697 --> 33:55.066
So, what you do is you take your opponent's weight

33:55.133 --> 33:57.068
and you use it against him.

33:57.135 --> 33:58.736
Put your glass down.

34:05.476 --> 34:08.646
If I come at you with a punch, block it. Right.

34:08.713 --> 34:12.583
And then I want you to shift your weight right there,

34:12.650 --> 34:15.787
next to my body. You feel that?

34:15.853 --> 34:17.021
All right.

34:17.088 --> 34:20.324
Take me back like this. You see that?

34:21.926 --> 34:24.095
I'm gonna tell you to take my weight over

34:24.162 --> 34:25.663
and let the momentum take me over.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.298
[grunts] Sorry.

34:27.365 --> 34:30.234
I should have warned you I'm a bad ass.

34:31.936 --> 34:33.237
Yeah.

34:33.304 --> 34:34.772
I should have read it.

34:34.839 --> 34:37.608
So, it's on me, really.

34:37.675 --> 34:41.679
You know, if you don't tell me something about yourself,

34:41.746 --> 34:43.781
I'm gonna have to make it up.

34:45.583 --> 34:49.720
You're... tough on the outside,

34:49.787 --> 34:55.059
but... I think you're a big softie on the inside.

34:55.126 --> 34:56.761
Mm, the kind of guy who

34:56.828 --> 35:00.431
carries missing person's posters in his bag.

35:00.498 --> 35:02.300
Hey, you know, I should get back to the--

35:02.366 --> 35:04.135
Mm. Mmh-mnh.

35:04.202 --> 35:05.269
You're not going anywhere

35:05.336 --> 35:07.338
until you tell me something.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.608
Anything.

35:13.244 --> 35:17.448
When I say that I'm from everywhere, I mean it.

35:17.515 --> 35:20.318
I come from a military family.

35:20.384 --> 35:22.053
We moved around a lot.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.788
But no matter where we went,

35:23.855 --> 35:27.191
my father would find an old theater

35:27.258 --> 35:28.826
playing a cowboy movie.

35:30.328 --> 35:32.997
And he'd drag us off to see it.

35:33.064 --> 35:34.765
See, was that so hard?

35:36.501 --> 35:41.339
So... why do you carry those posters around?

35:54.285 --> 35:56.387
Cheyenne is my sister.

35:56.454 --> 35:59.157
And I carry the posters around

35:59.223 --> 36:01.225
because somebody keeps taking 'em down.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.761
And I'm not gonna let this town forget her.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.865
She over moved here a few years ago.

36:09.433 --> 36:13.204
And just stopped answering my calls.

36:13.271 --> 36:17.175
So... I put my life on the hold,

36:17.241 --> 36:20.378
and I moved here to try to find her.

36:21.779 --> 36:25.783
But when the police just wouldn't take me serious,

36:25.850 --> 36:28.219
wouldn't respond...

36:28.286 --> 36:31.122
I bought that old RV out there

36:31.189 --> 36:32.857
and I took it upon myself.

36:35.393 --> 36:37.428
And that was two years ago.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.633
-She's lucky to have you. -Listen, I gotta go, all right?

36:44.735 --> 36:46.470
Goodnight.

36:52.677 --> 36:54.045
[Xavier] What are you doing here?

36:54.111 --> 36:56.981
[Michael] I just wanted to come by and see Brianna.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.482
[Xavier] I can't let you do that. Let's go.

36:58.549 --> 36:59.650
[Michael] Hey, come on, come on.

36:59.717 --> 37:01.385
Get your, get your hands off me.

37:01.452 --> 37:03.054
Bro, this is my house.

37:03.120 --> 37:05.289
Michael.

37:05.356 --> 37:07.825
Brianna! Tell him to let me go.

37:07.892 --> 37:09.627
What are you doing here?

37:09.694 --> 37:11.495
I came to see how you're doing.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.864
Pick up a few things. I'll only be a minute.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.269
Let him up.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.576
Wow.

37:25.643 --> 37:26.777
This place looks great.

37:26.844 --> 37:28.713
You've been taking good care of it.

37:30.314 --> 37:32.350
Hey, House, put on some coffee.

37:32.416 --> 37:34.151
[automated message] Right away, Michael.

37:34.218 --> 37:36.420
[sighs] I missed this place.

37:38.589 --> 37:40.524
I missed that view.

37:44.629 --> 37:47.298
I missed that view more.

37:47.365 --> 37:48.933
I forgive you, by the way.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.502
-For testifying against me. -[Bri] Michael.

37:51.569 --> 37:53.938
[Michael] You're lucky they let you stay here.

37:54.005 --> 37:55.873
You got off easy, trust me. Prison is--

37:55.940 --> 37:58.042
Michael!

37:58.109 --> 38:00.611
What are you doing here?

38:00.678 --> 38:03.681
You know I can get in trouble for this.

38:03.748 --> 38:06.183
[Michael] I'm sorry. I just wanted to see you.

38:06.250 --> 38:09.320
You have no idea how lonely it was in that place.

38:11.389 --> 38:14.325
Well, here I am. Because of you.

38:15.993 --> 38:19.630
And you can stop everything that you've been doing now.

38:22.266 --> 38:25.002
-Stop what? -All of it!

38:25.069 --> 38:28.773
The theatrics, the-the photographs, everything.

38:28.839 --> 38:30.675
-You've made your point. -Photographs?

38:30.741 --> 38:32.376
What are you, what are you talking about?

38:32.443 --> 38:33.744
You have been taking pictures of me.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.714
And leaving them outside.

38:36.781 --> 38:39.717
-Has someone been bothering you? -Michael, please.

38:39.784 --> 38:41.986
You think I would do something like that?

38:45.690 --> 38:47.858
I'm trying to move forward with my life.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.664
I'm sorry, I just...

38:53.731 --> 38:57.001
[sighs] I just don't know who else could be doing this.

39:06.210 --> 39:08.446
How many of these have you gone through?

39:09.447 --> 39:10.848
Stop it.

39:12.516 --> 39:13.651
[Michael] I was hoping you'd slow down

39:13.718 --> 39:15.152
on the drinking a little, but...

39:15.219 --> 39:17.621
It's none of your business.

39:20.658 --> 39:22.827
It's my business when it's my wine.

39:22.893 --> 39:24.562
And my home.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.168
Michael, please.

39:31.235 --> 39:34.505
Could you just tell the truth? For once.

39:34.572 --> 39:36.974
Brianna, I've been in prison for months.

39:37.041 --> 39:39.410
I have no idea what's going on. Okay?

39:39.477 --> 39:42.179
But if you're in some kind of trouble, or you're scared...

39:43.614 --> 39:45.583
I can always help you.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.320
And I want you to know that I'm sorry

39:49.387 --> 39:51.122
about how everything went down.

39:55.359 --> 39:56.694
Things are different now.

39:56.761 --> 39:58.996
And I can prove that to you if you let me.

40:05.536 --> 40:07.805
Xavier, can you show him out please?

40:14.178 --> 40:16.647
[crickets chirping]

40:24.455 --> 40:25.923
[door clicks]

40:29.026 --> 40:31.495
[intense music]

40:39.837 --> 40:42.039
House, lower the temperature.

40:45.576 --> 40:49.480
House, turn off the heater.

40:53.617 --> 40:55.686
House, are you there?

41:01.091 --> 41:03.627
[intense music]

41:14.104 --> 41:15.706
Xavier?

41:20.511 --> 41:22.079
Xavier!

41:32.156 --> 41:34.625
[music continues]

41:59.016 --> 42:00.885
[device beeping]

42:03.487 --> 42:05.956
[music continues]

42:11.562 --> 42:13.764
[door rattling]

42:20.938 --> 42:22.706
-[grunts] -[yelps]

42:27.244 --> 42:28.746
[grunting]

42:31.582 --> 42:33.117
[screams]

42:34.718 --> 42:36.186
[glass shatters]

42:43.360 --> 42:45.996
[screaming]

42:51.068 --> 42:52.870
[grunts]

42:52.937 --> 42:55.406
[Xavier] Bri, wake up. Hey!

42:55.472 --> 42:57.541
Hey, hey, hey. Bri, wake up!

42:57.608 --> 42:59.610
Hey, hey, hey.

43:04.114 --> 43:05.849
[sobbing]

43:08.218 --> 43:11.121
[Xavier] I came as soon as I seen all the lights flashing.

43:12.790 --> 43:14.692
The keypad wouldn't let me in.

43:15.993 --> 43:18.762
I was gonna break the window, but...

43:18.829 --> 43:22.066
then the door just unlocked.

43:23.267 --> 43:25.202
[sighs]

43:25.269 --> 43:27.471
Michael.

43:27.538 --> 43:29.440
Michael?

43:29.506 --> 43:31.208
He's the only other person

43:31.275 --> 43:33.744
that could have control over the house.

43:35.012 --> 43:37.581
Why would he do that, come in and hit you

43:37.648 --> 43:39.516
when he's on parole?

43:39.583 --> 43:42.186
To remind me I can't escape him.

43:43.821 --> 43:45.856
[Xavier exhales]

43:55.065 --> 43:56.400
Bri.

43:58.335 --> 43:59.970
Check this out.

44:03.607 --> 44:05.175
[Bri] Is that a camera?

44:05.242 --> 44:07.111
Yeah.

44:07.177 --> 44:09.380
Hidden in the picture frame.

44:09.446 --> 44:11.749
I thought there were no cameras in the house.

44:14.752 --> 44:16.253
I didn't think there were.

44:18.322 --> 44:21.058
Son of a bitch has been watching me this entire time?

44:27.131 --> 44:29.733
Are there cameras everywhere?

44:29.800 --> 44:33.003
-Can he see me everywhere? -Uh, calm down.

44:33.070 --> 44:35.072
I'll sweep the house.

44:36.573 --> 44:37.941
I'll see if there're more, okay?

44:38.008 --> 44:40.844
Xavier, I'm a sitting duck here.

44:40.911 --> 44:42.179
We have to do something.

44:42.246 --> 44:44.748
I think I know someone who can help.

44:45.683 --> 44:47.484
I promise we'll figure this out.

44:47.551 --> 44:51.455
Could you just stay the night in the house?

44:51.522 --> 44:52.956
Just for now.

44:54.158 --> 44:56.293
I have a guestroom that you can use.

44:57.561 --> 44:59.129
It's just, ah...

45:00.831 --> 45:03.233
I don't want to be alone.

45:03.300 --> 45:04.902
Of course.

45:06.570 --> 45:07.838
[door squeaking]

45:07.905 --> 45:09.406
[door closes]

45:15.179 --> 45:16.146
[sighs]

45:19.283 --> 45:20.250
[sighs]

45:29.793 --> 45:32.930
[instrumental music]

45:42.673 --> 45:43.907
I don't know.

45:43.974 --> 45:46.009
All right. That's all of them.

45:47.878 --> 45:49.279
[Xavier chuckles]

45:49.346 --> 45:50.814
Wow.

45:52.883 --> 45:55.686
So, how do you know each other?

45:55.753 --> 45:57.521
Dex and I used to work together.

45:58.956 --> 46:00.791
Yeah, okay. [chuckles]

46:00.858 --> 46:04.294
So here's the deal, someone gained access to your system

46:04.361 --> 46:06.363
via the app that controls the house.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.632
I tried to track the IP address, but nothing's coming up.

46:08.699 --> 46:09.767
Probably spoofed through a VPN.

46:09.833 --> 46:11.268
What do you mean?

46:11.335 --> 46:13.470
It means that your attacker covered their tracks.

46:13.537 --> 46:17.007
Exactly. I locked out any other users, so only you have control.

46:17.074 --> 46:19.376
Now, about the cameras.

46:19.443 --> 46:22.379
I can't find a way to access the video feeds online.

46:22.446 --> 46:24.214
Meaning, it's being stored locally.

46:24.281 --> 46:26.750
-So we can watch the footage? -Oh, no. That's the thing.

46:26.817 --> 46:28.352
It's not being stored locally here.

46:28.418 --> 46:30.821
I was able to track it to a location closer to the city.

46:30.888 --> 46:32.723
About fifty miles away.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.925
Michael's house.

46:34.992 --> 46:38.462
It was our main residence. Has to be there.

46:38.529 --> 46:41.231
If you want to see the footage, that's where you'll find it.

46:42.833 --> 46:44.601
That's not really an option.

46:44.668 --> 46:47.137
Oh, my God. Cool.

46:47.204 --> 46:49.139
[Xavier] Maybe I could go in.

46:49.206 --> 46:51.241
Get in and out before anybody sees me.

46:52.176 --> 46:53.877
I'm not staying here alone.

46:53.944 --> 46:55.846
And, you don't know the property.

46:55.913 --> 46:57.648
-I used to live there. -Hm.

46:57.714 --> 47:01.919
I could help if I could just get the hell out of this house.

47:03.086 --> 47:04.755
Oh, I can get you outta here.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.390
-Really? -Yeah.

47:06.456 --> 47:08.258
That ankle monitor uses a SIM card

47:08.325 --> 47:10.127
with GPS to determine your position,

47:10.194 --> 47:12.095
and a cell data network to send the coordinates back.

47:12.162 --> 47:13.931
So all you really need to do is build a Faraday cage

47:13.997 --> 47:15.532
to block the signal, fake a phone network

47:15.599 --> 47:18.502
to bypass any tamper control, remove the SIM card

47:18.569 --> 47:20.470
and access it with your phone, boom.

47:20.537 --> 47:21.738
[chuckling]

47:21.805 --> 47:24.041
I have no idea what you just said.

47:24.107 --> 47:26.076
Basically, your probation officer will think

47:26.143 --> 47:28.545
that your phone is your ankle monitor.

47:28.612 --> 47:30.547
It can buy you a little bit of time.

47:31.715 --> 47:33.750
I'm in.

47:33.817 --> 47:37.421
First, we'll have to get to Michael's safe room upstairs.

47:37.487 --> 47:39.289
It's where the security system is.

47:39.356 --> 47:41.291
That's where we'll find the hard drive.

47:41.358 --> 47:43.393
Safe room. This guy would have a safe room.

47:43.460 --> 47:44.995
You know, if you want to break into a house

47:45.062 --> 47:46.463
anything like this one, there's going to be some

47:46.530 --> 47:47.731
serious tech involved.

47:47.798 --> 47:51.869
And we're talkin' cameras, alarms, motion lights.

47:51.935 --> 47:54.605
We'll just wait until he goes upstairs.

47:54.671 --> 47:56.340
If we can cut the power out,

47:56.406 --> 47:58.242
we can get in without him seeing us.

47:58.308 --> 48:00.911
I can try and access the power grid remotely.

48:00.978 --> 48:03.113
-Turn it off there. -Great.

48:05.382 --> 48:08.285
But, he has a backup generator in the backyard.

48:08.352 --> 48:10.988
It automatically turns on when the power goes out.

48:12.322 --> 48:14.391
We'll have to disarm it, so we can get inside

48:14.458 --> 48:16.126
and get out before he figures it out.

48:16.193 --> 48:18.629
So, if we take the hard drive, will that automatically

48:18.695 --> 48:20.931
wipe the footage of us bein' inside?

48:22.199 --> 48:24.434
Th-theoretically.

48:24.501 --> 48:26.803
Say we find out Michael is behind this.

48:26.870 --> 48:30.140
We can't exactly just take the stolen footage to the police.

48:30.207 --> 48:33.343
[suspenseful music]

48:37.147 --> 48:39.783
All the lies he's told...

48:39.850 --> 48:42.653
all the times he's made me question myself over

48:42.719 --> 48:44.221
and over again...

48:45.756 --> 48:47.090
I just need to know.

48:48.558 --> 48:51.328
Okay. I'll get to work on breaking into the power grid.

48:51.395 --> 48:53.463
It should only take me a day of two.

48:53.530 --> 48:57.401
So, how do we stop the signal to her ankle monitor?

49:00.804 --> 49:02.506
I have a plan.

49:04.942 --> 49:06.643
It loses signal down here.

49:06.710 --> 49:08.278
But be careful.

49:08.345 --> 49:10.614
If it gets damaged or it cuts off,

49:10.681 --> 49:12.916
it starts recording and cops will show up.

49:12.983 --> 49:14.418
[Dex chuckles] Good to know.

49:14.484 --> 49:17.621
Well, you know what? You can use my phone for network.

49:17.688 --> 49:19.222
Bri's gonna need hers.

49:19.289 --> 49:20.857
How chivalrous. [chuckles]

49:20.924 --> 49:23.927
Don't forget to put the SIM card back when you're done.

49:23.994 --> 49:25.429
Got it.

49:27.097 --> 49:29.032
Probably get a call in a few minutes anyway.

49:29.099 --> 49:32.235
[phone buzzing]

49:37.641 --> 49:39.443
Hey, Nancy.

49:39.509 --> 49:42.045
Uh, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

49:42.112 --> 49:44.948
I forgot. I forgot. I'm sorry. [chuckles]

49:45.015 --> 49:47.484
Yes, I'm in the basement.

49:47.551 --> 49:49.786
No. I'll head, I'll head upstairs right now.

49:52.556 --> 49:54.091
Do you see me?

49:55.158 --> 49:57.160
You don't?

49:57.227 --> 49:59.162
No, no, no. You don't have to send anybody over.

49:59.229 --> 50:00.998
It's okay.

50:01.064 --> 50:02.699
I... Oh, good.

50:02.766 --> 50:04.267
Good, you see me. Yes.

50:04.334 --> 50:06.570
I'm sorry. Goodnight.

50:08.271 --> 50:11.408
Oh, my God. I thought they'd have a heart attack.

50:11.475 --> 50:12.442
It worked!

50:13.977 --> 50:16.313
You know this is insane, right?

50:16.380 --> 50:19.082
-Yeah. -Well, you're ready?

50:19.149 --> 50:21.618
[exhales] As ready as I'm gonna be.

50:21.685 --> 50:23.286
I'm gonna be driving though, okay?

50:23.353 --> 50:27.691
-No. I need to-- -Your RV is not inconspicuous.

50:27.758 --> 50:29.393
Whatever you say.

50:37.034 --> 50:42.139
Xavier and I, um, we served together in the marines.

50:42.205 --> 50:44.241
He's a really good man.

50:56.420 --> 50:59.022
[crickets chirping]

50:59.089 --> 51:00.891
[Bri] Come on.

51:00.957 --> 51:04.227
Come on, Michael. Go upstairs already. Jesus!

51:05.962 --> 51:08.498
Hey, we can pull this off.

51:08.565 --> 51:12.335
The most illegal thing I've ever done was skip school.

51:13.637 --> 51:14.738
This is just...

51:16.106 --> 51:18.041
Just nerves.

51:18.108 --> 51:20.811
-Talk to me. -About what?

51:20.877 --> 51:23.146
Anything.

51:23.213 --> 51:25.282
What's the first thing you want to do

51:25.348 --> 51:28.051
when come off house arrest?

51:28.118 --> 51:30.554
Go for a run.

51:30.620 --> 51:32.689
I miss feeling the wind on my face.

51:32.756 --> 51:35.292
I used to run up and down this hill...

51:36.893 --> 51:39.663
until Michael decided it was too dangerous.

51:41.131 --> 51:43.800
How did you meet him anyway?

51:43.867 --> 51:46.103
Sophia introduced us.

51:46.169 --> 51:49.272
Took me to a party at this house, actually.

51:49.339 --> 51:51.475
Never thought I'd live here.

51:51.541 --> 51:53.276
That's enough about Michael.

51:53.343 --> 51:55.679
What about you? What're your plans?

51:55.745 --> 51:59.249
Well, I've been so focused on Cheyenne that

51:59.316 --> 52:02.219
I haven't thought much beyond that.

52:02.285 --> 52:03.720
Do you have any leads?

52:03.787 --> 52:06.756
I searched her apartment right before she went missing.

52:06.823 --> 52:09.493
And I got into her phone records, there was a number

52:09.559 --> 52:11.528
that she was calling, but, uh...

52:11.595 --> 52:14.064
I haven't been able to track it down.

52:14.131 --> 52:15.732
The number that you asked me about?

52:15.799 --> 52:16.766
Yeah.

52:16.833 --> 52:18.568
Apparently, it's from a burner phone.

52:18.635 --> 52:21.605
I gave that information to the police and...

52:22.939 --> 52:25.342
they didn't do anything with that either.

52:32.249 --> 52:33.917
Okay, that's our cue.

52:35.719 --> 52:36.686
Ready?

52:38.288 --> 52:41.424
[suspenseful music]

52:45.061 --> 52:46.229
[phone beeps]

52:48.265 --> 52:49.900
Hey, Dex. He's upstairs.

52:49.966 --> 52:51.635
Are you ready?

52:54.771 --> 52:55.739
[switch clicks]

52:57.307 --> 52:58.375
Let's go.

52:58.441 --> 53:01.578
[music continues]

53:04.314 --> 53:05.682
You know how to pick locks too?

53:07.184 --> 53:08.351
Yeah.

53:12.222 --> 53:14.457
This one's a little tinier.

53:16.560 --> 53:19.596
I'm just really, so good at this.

53:19.663 --> 53:22.165
Just, just a second, Bri.

53:22.232 --> 53:23.733
We'll be in no time.

53:23.800 --> 53:25.335
[door opens]

53:27.037 --> 53:29.973
[music continues]

53:57.734 --> 54:00.637
-This is your room? -[Bri] Once upon a time.

54:02.205 --> 54:04.307
Why, this piece of shit!

54:07.043 --> 54:08.011
Got it.

54:11.414 --> 54:13.416
Here's the system.

54:13.483 --> 54:14.584
Okay, but what am I looking for?

54:14.651 --> 54:16.753
It's a plastic or a metal box.

54:16.820 --> 54:19.289
[Bri] But they're all plastic and metal. Which one?

54:19.356 --> 54:20.657
[Xavier] The hard drive.

54:20.724 --> 54:22.025
Just look.

54:25.595 --> 54:27.364
This is the address to the lake house.

54:27.430 --> 54:28.531
Well, that's it.

54:28.598 --> 54:30.400
The tape, the tape!

54:35.705 --> 54:38.708
Michael, did you get it working?

54:45.248 --> 54:47.350
"Let there be light."

54:49.486 --> 54:51.388
Now, where were we?

54:54.124 --> 54:56.326
[dramatic music]

54:56.393 --> 54:57.761
Close the door, he's coming.

54:57.827 --> 54:59.763
-Close the door, go! -Ah!

55:06.102 --> 55:07.070
It's stuck.

55:08.438 --> 55:09.606
[door opens]

55:30.360 --> 55:31.494
Did you open that?

55:31.561 --> 55:34.397
-Did you go in there? -No.

55:42.372 --> 55:44.908
[door creaking]

55:55.418 --> 55:56.419
Did you go through my things?

55:56.486 --> 55:58.054
[chuckling] No.

55:58.121 --> 56:00.090
I was literally in the shower with you, the power went out

56:00.156 --> 56:01.358
and, and I stayed right here.

56:01.424 --> 56:02.659
I didn't go anywhere.

56:02.726 --> 56:05.862
Then why is the damn door open?

56:05.929 --> 56:07.797
I don't know.

56:07.864 --> 56:09.599
[Michael] Well, I didn't go in there.

56:09.666 --> 56:11.668
That leaves one other person.

56:11.735 --> 56:13.436
So don't talk to me like I'm an idiot!

56:13.503 --> 56:15.405
[Mackenzie] Get your hands off of me!

56:15.472 --> 56:17.240
[Michael] That is my private space, you have

56:17.307 --> 56:18.408
no right being in there.

56:18.475 --> 56:19.509
[Mackenzie] I wasn't.

56:19.576 --> 56:21.811
You can go screw yourself.

56:21.878 --> 56:22.812
I'm leaving.

56:22.879 --> 56:25.648
Shit! Wait, Mackenzie. I'm sorry.

56:25.715 --> 56:28.618
Hold on a minute. You don't have to go.

56:37.460 --> 56:40.597
[suspenseful music]

57:07.490 --> 57:10.627
[music continues]

57:37.520 --> 57:40.657
[music continues]

57:42.625 --> 57:44.894
[both laughing]

57:44.961 --> 57:46.796
[both sigh]

57:48.565 --> 57:51.701
[phone buzzing]

57:56.206 --> 57:57.807
Hello, Nancy?

57:59.909 --> 58:02.645
What do you mean you can't see me?

58:10.019 --> 58:11.554
Ms. Collins?

58:14.290 --> 58:16.659
Hey, Nancy!

58:16.726 --> 58:19.128
Told you I was here.

58:19.195 --> 58:21.831
We've been here one too many times, Ms. Collins.

58:21.898 --> 58:24.801
And your behavior is increasingly erratic.

58:24.868 --> 58:25.902
I'm sorry. I told you about the--

58:25.969 --> 58:28.238
That's no longer an excuse.

58:28.304 --> 58:31.241
Okay? I'm sorry. We went over this. Cuff her.

58:31.307 --> 58:33.176
No, wait.

58:33.243 --> 58:34.744
Nancy, please.

58:34.811 --> 58:36.913
I've had a...

58:36.980 --> 58:41.050
a really, really rough year.

58:41.117 --> 58:43.386
I lost my husband,

58:43.453 --> 58:46.122
my home, my freedom.

58:47.457 --> 58:49.526
Ev-everything I've loved

58:49.592 --> 58:51.728
has been taken from me.

58:51.794 --> 58:54.030
But I'm here!

58:54.097 --> 58:56.799
I'm here where I'm supposed to be.

58:56.866 --> 59:00.203
Please! Please! Just give me one more chance.

59:21.457 --> 59:24.594
[mellow music]

59:34.737 --> 59:37.874
[phone buzzing]

59:51.487 --> 59:54.624
[suspenseful music]

1:00:07.837 --> 1:00:09.639
[sighing]

1:00:11.507 --> 1:00:13.977
-[Bri] Good morning. -Morning to you, too.

1:00:14.043 --> 1:00:17.347
Hey, I love this kitchen.

1:00:17.413 --> 1:00:18.581
How was your night?

1:00:18.648 --> 1:00:22.318
Before or after breaking and entering?

1:00:22.385 --> 1:00:23.987
[chuckles]

1:00:24.053 --> 1:00:27.890
Ah. So, the hard drive is encrypted.

1:00:27.957 --> 1:00:29.892
I have to run it by Dex,

1:00:29.959 --> 1:00:32.862
and with any luck, we're gonna have some answers soon.

1:00:34.063 --> 1:00:35.298
Great.

1:00:38.801 --> 1:00:41.170
Something I need you to know.

1:00:41.237 --> 1:00:43.339
I found this phone under Michael's bed last night.

1:00:44.874 --> 1:00:46.442
It's a burner phone.

1:00:46.509 --> 1:00:50.613
It's the phone that Cheyenne was calling when she disappeared.

1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:52.482
Hold on.

1:00:52.548 --> 1:00:53.850
Cheyenne was calling Michael?

1:00:53.916 --> 1:00:56.352
Cheyenne disappeared at Sandpoint Lake.

1:00:56.419 --> 1:00:57.954
So that means, the son of a bitch had

1:00:58.021 --> 1:00:59.789
something to do with it.

1:01:01.391 --> 1:01:03.326
[phone buzzing]

1:01:05.662 --> 1:01:09.032
Ah! That's Dex. I got to go. I'm gonna go through the footage.

1:01:09.098 --> 1:01:11.134
-Wait, you're leaving? -Yeah.

1:01:12.769 --> 1:01:14.370
I'll be back soon.

1:01:14.437 --> 1:01:15.905
All right?

1:01:21.477 --> 1:01:25.114
Have there been any incidents since I saw you last?

1:01:25.181 --> 1:01:27.216
Break-ins, things like that?

1:01:29.519 --> 1:01:30.920
Oh, plenty.

1:01:30.987 --> 1:01:33.389
Probably just the house settling, though.

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:40.063
I understand you've been working with Xavier Johnson recently?

1:01:40.129 --> 1:01:44.200
I didn't have a lot of options after you guys turned me down.

1:01:44.267 --> 1:01:45.902
Have you had any issues with him?

1:01:45.968 --> 1:01:48.438
Why would I have issues?

1:01:48.504 --> 1:01:51.808
Are you familiar with his...

1:01:51.874 --> 1:01:53.409
criminal record?

1:01:53.476 --> 1:01:57.246
He's currently a suspect in the disappearance of his sister,

1:01:57.313 --> 1:01:59.348
Cheyenne Clark.

1:01:59.415 --> 1:02:02.085
We're building a case against him.

1:02:02.151 --> 1:02:05.888
But if I were you, I'd keep my distance.

1:02:08.491 --> 1:02:10.059
I don't understand.

1:02:10.126 --> 1:02:13.496
Xavier isn't a criminal. He's private security.

1:02:13.563 --> 1:02:16.399
That background is part of what makes him so dangerous.

1:02:18.267 --> 1:02:19.969
How did you get that black eye, Ms--

1:02:20.036 --> 1:02:21.804
What about Michael?

1:02:21.871 --> 1:02:23.873
Is he involved in the Cheyenne case?

1:02:23.940 --> 1:02:25.108
Well, he was a person of interest.

1:02:25.174 --> 1:02:26.642
But we cleared him quickly.

1:02:26.709 --> 1:02:28.778
-Air-tight alibi. -Which was what?

1:02:28.845 --> 1:02:30.213
-A work trip. -Oh...

1:02:30.279 --> 1:02:33.850
Corroborated by several of his colleagues.

1:02:33.916 --> 1:02:36.352
Does that sound right to you?

1:02:36.419 --> 1:02:39.422
He did a lot of things I wasn't aware of.

1:02:39.489 --> 1:02:41.891
I didn't even know he knew Cheyenne.

1:02:44.861 --> 1:02:48.064
I know this is a lot to take in.

1:02:49.165 --> 1:02:51.601
But you can trust me.

1:02:51.667 --> 1:02:54.036
My only priority is your safety.

1:02:56.472 --> 1:02:58.407
Mr. Johnson has a history of violence.

1:02:58.474 --> 1:03:01.410
I don't know how he'll react if he's pushed.

1:03:02.612 --> 1:03:04.680
[engine revving]

He's enroute to the hospital.

I don't know. I didn't see it happen.

1:04:59.629 --> 1:05:02.798
And why do you have those polaroid's of Cheyenne?

1:05:02.865 --> 1:05:05.568
They look just like the pictures that were taken of me.

1:05:05.635 --> 1:05:09.205
I got those from Cheyenne's apartment.

1:05:09.272 --> 1:05:11.374
Those are the last pictures I have of her.

1:05:14.443 --> 1:05:15.912

1:17:07.723 --> 1:17:10.859
[instrumental music]

1:17:17.833 --> 1:17:20.202
How were you controlling the house?

1:17:37.786 --> 1:17:40.922
[music continues]

1:17:55.771 --> 1:18:00.108
Oak-y with a finish of nutmeg.

1:18:02.010 --> 1:18:04.379
You did a great job cleaning up the place.

1:18:04.446 --> 1:18:06.014
Wish I could've helped.

1:18:07.049 --> 1:18:08.917
How're you feeling now?

1:18:11.853 --> 1:18:16.124
Better than I have in a long time, actually.

1:18:16.191 --> 1:18:18.894
Starting to think about what I'll do next.

1:18:18.960 --> 1:18:21.229
Once I'm free.

1:18:21.296 --> 1:18:23.298
I'm so glad.

1:18:23.365 --> 1:18:24.399
So catch me up.

1:18:24.466 --> 1:18:27.803
Did the police close the investigation?

1:18:27.869 --> 1:18:29.171
Yeah.

1:18:29.237 --> 1:18:32.441
They wrapped it up, and moved on.

1:18:32.507 --> 1:18:35.043
Joe attacked me. And it's pretty cut and dry.

1:18:36.912 --> 1:18:40.215
There's just one thing

1:18:40.282 --> 1:18:42.584
that I'm having trouble with.

1:18:42.651 --> 1:18:44.386
And maybe you can help me.

1:18:44.453 --> 1:18:46.822
Of course. Anything.

1:18:46.888 --> 1:18:51.359
I know why Joe wanted to kill Xavier.

1:18:51.426 --> 1:18:53.128
But why was he after me?

1:18:54.629 --> 1:18:56.364
Why pretend to be a cop at all?

1:18:58.133 --> 1:19:01.970
It's common to have questions after something like this.

1:19:02.037 --> 1:19:04.773
A lot of victims struggle to find closure.

1:19:06.274 --> 1:19:08.210
Maybe.

1:19:08.276 --> 1:19:11.780
You must be relieved your stalker's finally gone.

1:19:11.847 --> 1:19:13.482
I would be...

1:19:18.253 --> 1:19:21.056
But Joe wasn't my stalker.

1:19:21.123 --> 1:19:23.391
At least, not the only one.

1:19:24.893 --> 1:19:27.596
You were, Sofia.

1:19:27.662 --> 1:19:29.364
The both of you.

1:19:29.431 --> 1:19:30.899
[chuckles]

1:19:30.966 --> 1:19:33.401
Bri, that's ridiculous.

1:19:33.468 --> 1:19:36.738
You said it yourself, Joe attacked you.

1:19:36.805 --> 1:19:40.108
-I don't know why. -I think you do.

1:19:40.175 --> 1:19:43.745
There's a common thread between Xavier and Joe...

1:19:43.812 --> 1:19:45.547
You.

1:19:45.614 --> 1:19:48.483
[suspenseful music]

1:19:52.020 --> 1:19:53.855
Is that what this is about?

1:19:53.922 --> 1:19:55.690
How was I supposed to know? He--

1:19:55.757 --> 1:20:00.262
Court records show that you represented a Joseph Mitchell

1:20:00.328 --> 1:20:04.633
in an assault case a few years back, and won.

1:20:04.699 --> 1:20:06.234
You both knew each other.

1:20:06.301 --> 1:20:07.402
[Sofia chuckles]

1:20:07.469 --> 1:20:11.106
The firm represents a lot of people, Bri.

1:20:11.173 --> 1:20:13.408
And don't forget, he attacked me too.

1:20:13.475 --> 1:20:16.111
[Bri] The cops found an RV parked down the street

1:20:16.178 --> 1:20:17.779
missing a mirror.

1:20:17.846 --> 1:20:19.314
Just like Xavier's.

1:20:19.381 --> 1:20:22.117
But it was registered to Joe.

1:20:22.184 --> 1:20:24.619
And Xavier's RV was at a friend's house

1:20:24.686 --> 1:20:26.955
when the mirror was smashed.

1:20:27.022 --> 1:20:29.057
I was at work.

1:20:29.124 --> 1:20:31.660
I can have a dozen colleagues vouch for me.

1:20:31.726 --> 1:20:34.563
[Bri] I assumed you would cover your tracks.

1:20:34.629 --> 1:20:38.133
But I didn't think you'd be so bad at it.

1:20:40.402 --> 1:20:43.872
Then again, you didn't expect us to survive.

1:20:46.041 --> 1:20:48.210
And Joe was with me when Michael got hit.

1:20:48.276 --> 1:20:49.244
So...

1:20:50.345 --> 1:20:52.647
it must have been you driving.

1:20:52.714 --> 1:20:55.951
Stop it. That's enough.

1:20:56.017 --> 1:20:59.154
If you want to end a friendship over a bunch of circumstantial

1:20:59.221 --> 1:21:01.189
evidence, that's fine.

1:21:03.291 --> 1:21:06.094
If you go down this road, it's your loss.

1:21:06.161 --> 1:21:07.696
House lock the doors.

1:21:07.762 --> 1:21:09.631
[locks clicking]

1:21:09.698 --> 1:21:11.666
Are you out of your mind?

1:21:11.733 --> 1:21:15.770
I spent weeks looking through the security footage

1:21:15.837 --> 1:21:20.242
from the cameras that you or I didn't know about.

1:21:20.308 --> 1:21:21.576
You know what I found?

1:21:26.081 --> 1:21:30.952
Michael saved some really interesting clips.

1:21:44.733 --> 1:21:46.468
You were screwing my husband.

1:21:47.435 --> 1:21:50.405
That's what all this is about.

1:21:50.472 --> 1:21:53.141
I knew you were in love with him, I just didn't

1:21:53.208 --> 1:21:56.077
think that you would take it this far.

1:21:59.381 --> 1:22:01.249
Is that why you had Cheyenne killed?

1:22:02.617 --> 1:22:06.955
You knew that Michael would never let me go.

1:22:07.022 --> 1:22:10.125
And Xavier would never let Cheyenne go.

1:22:10.191 --> 1:22:12.027
So you needed us both dead.

1:22:14.262 --> 1:22:16.197
You'll never prove any of this.

1:22:25.106 --> 1:22:27.042
I'll be right back.

1:22:35.250 --> 1:22:38.153
Hey, Brianna. Uh, my work trip got cut short.

1:22:39.754 --> 1:22:43.058
Yeah, it was pretty boring. I'll be home later tonight.

1:22:44.359 --> 1:22:46.494
Bye. I love you, baby.

1:22:49.130 --> 1:22:51.866
Hey, something came up with work. I gotta go.

1:22:51.933 --> 1:22:53.601
You got the login for the app that controls the house.

1:22:53.668 --> 1:22:56.604
You could just lock up before you leave.

1:22:56.671 --> 1:23:00.241
You knew how to control the house from your phone.

1:23:00.308 --> 1:23:01.776
But what you didn't know was, you were just

1:23:01.843 --> 1:23:03.945
a distraction for Michael.

1:23:04.012 --> 1:23:06.281
You couldn't even keep him happy.

1:23:06.348 --> 1:23:08.483
That's why he needed me.

1:23:08.550 --> 1:23:11.386
Is that what you told Joe so that he could help you?

1:23:12.988 --> 1:23:14.489
Or were you screwing him, too?

1:23:15.924 --> 1:23:18.760
-Joe was simple. -Not like Michael.

1:23:21.062 --> 1:23:22.630
He loved me.

1:23:24.132 --> 1:23:26.468
He wanted Cheyenne.

1:23:26.534 --> 1:23:28.703
And he just merely tolerated you

1:23:28.770 --> 1:23:30.872
because you made yourself easy.

1:23:30.939 --> 1:23:33.475
Michael does love me!

1:23:33.541 --> 1:23:35.643
He'll realize it once you're gone.

1:23:35.710 --> 1:23:39.014
And since Joe couldn't kill you, I'll have to do it myself.

1:23:39.080 --> 1:23:40.315
Remember when all this started

1:23:40.382 --> 1:23:42.517
and you said that this was a game.

1:23:43.852 --> 1:23:45.587
Well, I'm playing.

1:23:47.055 --> 1:23:53.094
This thing records audio when it's being tampered with.

1:23:53.161 --> 1:23:55.630
And I smashed it right before you came over.

1:23:57.198 --> 1:23:59.467
Clumsy me.

1:23:59.534 --> 1:24:01.302
The police, they're on their way right now, and they

1:24:01.369 --> 1:24:03.772
heard everything that you just said.

1:24:03.838 --> 1:24:06.641
I never understood what he saw in you.

1:24:06.708 --> 1:24:09.077
You were always so needy. With Michael, With me.

1:24:09.144 --> 1:24:10.311
[thuds]

1:24:11.880 --> 1:24:14.249
I do fine on my own.

1:24:14.315 --> 1:24:16.351
And I'm pretty sure that my lawyer sleeping with my

1:24:16.418 --> 1:24:18.920
co-defendant is pretty good grounds

1:24:18.987 --> 1:24:21.322
to get my plea deal thrown out.

1:24:21.389 --> 1:24:23.024
House, unlock the doors.

1:24:23.091 --> 1:24:24.259
[door opens]

1:24:28.229 --> 1:24:30.298
You didn't even need me.

1:24:36.871 --> 1:24:38.440
[handcuffs clicking]

1:24:52.687 --> 1:24:53.655
[Xavier sighing]

1:24:54.856 --> 1:24:56.624
[Xavier] Hey.

1:24:56.691 --> 1:25:00.395
So I called that police department up in Oakland.

1:25:00.462 --> 1:25:03.364
Your man got an interview next week. [chuckles]

1:25:03.431 --> 1:25:06.267
-Yes! Congratulations. -Thank you.

1:25:06.334 --> 1:25:08.303
Where do you think you're goin'?

1:25:08.369 --> 1:25:10.338
-Hm? -Out.

1:25:10.405 --> 1:25:12.006
[Xavier chuckles]

1:25:12.073 --> 1:25:13.775
We still have to pack.

1:25:13.842 --> 1:25:15.376
You still have to pack.

1:25:15.443 --> 1:25:17.245
[Xavier chuckles]

1:25:20.348 --> 1:25:21.516
I'm packin'.

1:25:22.817 --> 1:25:25.753
[instrumental music]

1:25:46.908 --> 1:25:49.844
[breathing heavily]

1:25:55.950 --> 1:25:58.887
