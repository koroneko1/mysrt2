1
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:45,747
<i>There's a big gap.</i>

2
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,387
<i>It seems like the only route,
let's keep going.</i>

3
00:00:57,347 --> 00:00:58,347
You okay?

4
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:03,627
It's about right.
Can't ever be easy.

5
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:05,707
Okay.

6
00:01:07,347 --> 00:01:08,387
- One.
- Be careful.

7
00:01:08,507 --> 00:01:09,867
Two, three.

8
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:13,507
You okay? Okay.

9
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:17,067
Oh, my God.

10
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:18,507
You're better.

11
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:22,547
Okay.

12
00:01:28,107 --> 00:01:29,227
- Shit!
- Whoa, you're good.

13
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:32,067
You're good, yeah? You're good?

14
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:36,107
- No.
- Okay, you've done way scarier than this.

15
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:38,547
Remember AJ Hackett, Snake Dike.

16
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:40,627
Stupid singing competition.

17
00:01:40,747 --> 00:01:43,187
God, you married this sad sack,
for Christ's sake.

18
00:01:44,267 --> 00:01:45,627
- Yeah? Okay.
- Okay.

19
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:50,387
One, two, three.

20
00:01:50,907 --> 00:01:52,387
Come on, I caught you

21
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:54,667
That's my girl.

22
00:01:57,067 --> 00:02:00,787
Ew, gross. You guys get a room.

23
00:02:02,707 --> 00:02:03,947
There's comes Ethan Hunt.

24
00:02:04,747 --> 00:02:06,627
Careful, H, there's loose rock
around the elbow.

25
00:02:06,987 --> 00:02:08,747
Worry about your ropes, bitches.

26
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:10,106
I'm fine.

27
00:02:12,627 --> 00:02:13,627
Try to keep on.

28
00:02:24,027 --> 00:02:25,347
Taking your time there, hot-shot.

29
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:28,627
Hunter, you show-off.

30
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:07,867
Dan!

31
00:03:11,187 --> 00:03:12,187
Dan!

32
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:14,907
Hang on Dan, hold on, I'm coming.

33
00:03:15,147 --> 00:03:16,147
Dan, are you okay?

34
00:03:16,227 --> 00:03:17,707
Just hold on, I'm coming down.

35
00:03:19,427 --> 00:03:21,907
Come on, come on. I can't make to it.

36
00:03:22,307 --> 00:03:23,827
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, Becky, Becky.

37
00:03:23,947 --> 00:03:26,747
I just need a little more line,
can you uncut? Are you secure?

38
00:03:27,667 --> 00:03:29,787
- Are you secure?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm secure.

39
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:32,467
Just uncut, and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.

40
00:03:32,627 --> 00:03:34,027
- Okay.
- I think I can reach it.

41
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:35,507
Ready?

42
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:42,387
- Can you reach it?
- Just, just one second.

43
00:03:42,627 --> 00:03:44,027
I think I can make it.

44
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:46,227
Hold on Dan, I'm almost there.

45
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:47,587
I just need more momentum.

46
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:48,707
Okay.

47
00:03:49,627 --> 00:03:50,627
No!

48
00:03:53,027 --> 00:03:54,027
Dan!

49
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:14,107
{\an8}51 WEEKS LATER

50
00:04:17,707 --> 00:04:20,547
<i>Hey, this is Becky and Dan,
leave a message.</i>

51
00:04:21,466 --> 00:04:22,667
<i>Hey, Becky, it's me.</i>

52
00:04:23,627 --> 00:04:26,667
<i>Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.</i>

53
00:04:27,227 --> 00:04:31,427
<i>But I... I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.</i>

54
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,587
<i>Sweetheart, I'm worried about you.</i>

55
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:38,587
<i>So whenever you stop
hating on me, I am here.</i>

56
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:39,947
CREMATED REMAINS

57
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:06,267
DAN

58
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:09,107
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

59
00:05:10,147 --> 00:05:13,987
<i>This is just a voicemail,
you've reached Dan.</i>

60
00:05:14,107 --> 00:05:16,163
<i>Just leave a message
and I'll hit you back when I can.</i>

61
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:17,707
<i>Get it on for the the beep.</i>

62
00:05:18,907 --> 00:05:19,907
Hey.

63
00:05:21,827 --> 00:05:22,827
I miss you.

64
00:05:31,027 --> 00:05:33,187
Dad, what? Are you stalking me now?

65
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:37,031
No, I just don't know what else to do
because you're not answering your phone.

66
00:05:37,055 --> 00:05:37,924
Take a hint.

67
00:05:38,008 --> 00:05:39,883
I think this is getting
a little bit ridiculous.

68
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:40,907
Ridiculous?

69
00:05:41,027 --> 00:05:45,263
You told me I shouldn't be so broken up
about him because he was an asshole.

70
00:05:45,347 --> 00:05:47,876
No, I said that maybe he didn't belong
on this pedestal

71
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,203
that you were putting him up on.

72
00:05:49,227 --> 00:05:52,067
That he wasn't this martyr
that you've been making him out to be.

73
00:05:52,187 --> 00:05:53,707
This is how you console your daughter?

74
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:55,827
I just want you
to be able to move on with your life.

75
00:05:55,867 --> 00:05:58,747
I don't wanna move on, I miss him.

76
00:06:00,227 --> 00:06:02,107
Every day, I miss the way he looked at me.

77
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:03,707
I miss the way he made me feel.

78
00:06:03,827 --> 00:06:04,827
- Sweetie.
- Don't.

79
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,020
Don't what?
What do you think you're doing, Becky?

80
00:06:07,147 --> 00:06:08,723
- I'm getting away from you.
- You are not driving. Stop it.

81
00:06:08,747 --> 00:06:10,147
Fuck off!

82
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,187
You don't get to talk to me like that!

83
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,627
Your mother and I,
we raised you better than that.

84
00:06:15,227 --> 00:06:19,187
So, getting shit-faced
and pushing the people away that love you

85
00:06:20,267 --> 00:06:21,427
is not gonna work.

86
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:23,907
All right, look, a horrible thing
happened to you.

87
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:27,027
But you have to start
living your life again.

88
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,233
All right? There's a whole big
wide world out there that needs you.

89
00:06:30,257 --> 00:06:32,290
And believe it or not, I need you.

90
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:34,787
Let me give you a ride home.

91
00:06:36,867 --> 00:06:38,107
I'd rather walk.

92
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,587
Let me ask you something.

93
00:06:44,267 --> 00:06:45,387
If roles reversed,

94
00:06:45,507 --> 00:06:47,467
if it had been you
that had fallen that day,

95
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:50,267
You think Dan is standing out here alone

96
00:06:50,467 --> 00:06:54,387
drowning in booze, grief, sorrow,
whatever the hell this is.

97
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:57,467
He's not.

98
00:06:58,187 --> 00:06:59,507
And you damn well know it.

99
00:07:01,107 --> 00:07:02,907
Goddamn it, Becky, I need you to try.

100
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:06,907
Do you know what I need, Dad?

101
00:07:07,867 --> 00:07:09,587
I need you to leave me alone.

102
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:19,267
Goddamn it.

103
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,347
DAN

- Hi.
- Hey.

113
00:08:16,227 --> 00:08:17,747
You look...

114
00:08:18,747 --> 00:08:22,067
- Awful.
- Yeah, like really freaking awful.

115
00:08:22,787 --> 00:08:23,787
Come here.

116
00:08:26,627 --> 00:08:31,307
So, what brings you back?
You're finally ready to rest?

117
00:08:32,626 --> 00:08:33,907
I'll rest when I'm dead.

118
00:08:35,267 --> 00:08:38,707
I have something that's planned,
and I need a partner in crime.

119
00:08:40,746 --> 00:08:43,507
Look, your Dad called me a few weeks ago.

120
00:08:44,507 --> 00:08:47,667
He didn't know who else to turn to.
And he said that you were in a bad place.

121
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,987
- He had no right to do that.
- He's worried about you.

122
00:08:50,427 --> 00:08:52,787
It's coming up on a year,
he doesn't want you to be alone.

123
00:08:53,667 --> 00:08:56,998
Look, the only thing that drives me
crazier than Dan's boxed ashes

124
00:08:57,082 --> 00:08:58,409
collecting dust in there

125
00:08:58,507 --> 00:09:00,147
is my best friend stuck in here with him.

126
00:09:01,427 --> 00:09:03,507
So, I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

127
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:06,467
You're not gonna like it,
but just try to keep an open mind.

128
00:09:06,907 --> 00:09:07,907
Look.

129
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:12,107
The B67 TV tower.

130
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:14,787
It's only a six hour drive from here.

131
00:09:14,907 --> 00:09:16,827
I was planning
on climbing it this weekend

132
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,787
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

133
00:09:22,267 --> 00:09:25,987
I would be an adventure, like old times.

134
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:28,787
And you could scatter Dan's ashes on top.

135
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:32,427
I just... I haven't climbed since...

136
00:09:32,547 --> 00:09:33,547
I get it.

137
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:38,307
But if you don't confront your fears
you are always going to be afraid.

138
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:43,547
What is it that Dan used to say?
Don't die if you wanna to live?

139
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,507
Or, keep living even if you're dying?

140
00:09:47,387 --> 00:09:48,883
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

141
00:09:48,907 --> 00:09:51,947
No, I'm sorry, Hunter, I just... I can't.

142
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:55,947
It's like a "no,"
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

143
00:09:56,707 --> 00:09:57,867
You're gonna be okay.

144
00:09:58,027 --> 00:09:59,747
- I can't.
- Hey, it's okay.

145
00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:01,987
It's okay.

146
00:10:38,867 --> 00:10:39,987
Morning, Princess.

147
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:43,627
What's wrong?

148
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:46,907
If you're scared of dying
don't be afraid to live.

149
00:10:48,867 --> 00:10:50,147
That's what Dan used to say.

150
00:10:52,547 --> 00:10:56,187
Let's do it.
Let's climb your stupid tower.

151
00:10:56,427 --> 00:10:59,707
Oh my gosh, Becky baby, I'm so excited.

152
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:02,987

154
00:11:06,427 --> 00:11:09,587
I've never actually seen this video.

155
00:11:10,427 --> 00:11:11,827
Shit, I was really ripped.

156
00:11:11,947 --> 00:11:13,707
Yeah, you're awesome.

157
00:11:14,227 --> 00:11:16,147
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

158
00:11:18,667 --> 00:11:23,027
Holy shit, look at your beaming face.

159
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,603
Who is this in the photo with you?

160

I don't know, it's an old date.

161
00:11:26,913 --> 00:11:28,553
- Who is it?
- Nobody, just give me my...

162
00:11:28,707 --> 00:11:30,387
Hunter has a boyfriend.

163
00:11:30,507 --> 00:11:32,587
It's nothing, just some guy.

164
00:11:32,707 --> 00:11:35,227
Oh, that "some guy" sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

165
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:40,907
DAD

166
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:48,667
<i>Yo, what's up, guys?</i>

167
00:11:48,787 --> 00:11:51,107
<i>Danger D, I'm back in the States, yo!</i>

168
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:52,827
<i>Super bad-ass.</i>

169
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,660
Okay, in my defense,

170
00:11:55,867 --> 00:11:58,747
I may act like a total dick on camera,
but it's worth it.

171
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:00,147
I get paid for this shit.

172
00:12:00,347 --> 00:12:02,347
It's enough to keep me traveling,
and you know me,

173
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:05,227
I have to be doing dangerous shit
to keep my blood pumping.

174
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:07,135
So, I might as well wanna try this gig.

175
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:09,707
I'm just saying,
if you're gonna be a YouTuber,

176
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:11,707
Why not be yourself? You are awesome.

177
00:12:11,907 --> 00:12:13,587
- Natural born click bait.
- No.

178
00:12:14,307 --> 00:12:16,787
What we're doing here, this is click bait.

179
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,507
Excuse me?

180
00:12:22,547 --> 00:12:24,347
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone.

181
00:12:24,387 --> 00:12:25,507
Power ain't free, ma'am.

182
00:12:26,347 --> 00:12:29,027
And do you know where the B67 TV tower is?

183
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:30,387
We can't find it on the map.

184
00:12:31,267 --> 00:12:32,307
You don't need a map.

185
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:34,987
You see that light way up there?

186
00:12:36,907 --> 00:12:37,907
This's your tower.

187
00:12:38,507 --> 00:12:40,227
That's insanely high.

188
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,083
What's with the light, I thought you said
it was out of commission?

189
00:12:45,107 --> 00:12:46,427
So aircraft can see it.

190
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:50,187
You know this was once
the tallest structure in the US?

191
00:12:51,547 --> 00:12:53,067
And now it's just this old relic.

192
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:56,347
They're gonna tear it down this winter.

193
00:12:57,587 --> 00:12:58,587
Becky?

194
00:12:58,827 --> 00:12:59,827
Becky.

195
00:13:00,627 --> 00:13:02,347
- What?
- Give me your phone charger.

196
00:13:03,547 --> 00:13:04,547
What are you doing?

197
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:08,067
A very cool life hack.

198
00:13:10,707 --> 00:13:13,987
Now I'm just gonna line up the prongs
with the elements in the lamp.

199
00:13:14,347 --> 00:13:15,347
And...

200
00:13:18,067 --> 00:13:19,507
How's that for a dumb YouTuber?

201
00:13:37,987 --> 00:13:39,587
Hey, honey.

202
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:42,947
Did you sleep well?

203
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,147
I love you.

204
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:56,707
You're not gonna say it back?

205
00:13:58,547 --> 00:13:59,547
I am saying it.

206
00:14:00,347 --> 00:14:05,667
One, four, three.

207
00:14:06,987 --> 00:14:08,147
I love you.

208
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:30,467
<i>Hey, come on, Bex, the sun's up.</i>

209
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:39,227
What's up "El Capitan"?

210
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:41,987
I don't know, but something's up,
Sports Illustrated.

211
00:14:42,827 --> 00:14:43,827
Tits for clicks.

212
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,507
Are you live streaming?

213
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:51,667
No girl, We'll shoot now, post later.

214
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:52,987
Okay, I don't wanna be in it.

215
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:57,507
<i>Hey, guys! Danger D here.</i>

216
00:14:57,627 --> 00:15:00,147
<i>And I have somebody
very special for you to meet.</i>

217
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,187
<i>Say hello, Becky C.</i>

218
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:03,427
<i>Hi.</i>

219
00:15:03,587 --> 00:15:08,587
<i>And we have something
totally bat-shit crazy for you guys today.</i>

220
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:12,267
<i>The B67 TV tower.</i>

221
00:15:12,627 --> 00:15:15,587
<i>This bad boy is over 2000 feet tall,</i>

222
00:15:15,787 --> 00:15:19,947
<i>and your home-girls are gonna
be climbing to the tippy tippy top.</i>

223
00:15:21,907 --> 00:15:23,655
<i>But don't worry, Becky C,
because you're safe...</i>

224
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,775
Watch out!

225
00:15:31,627 --> 00:15:33,667
Holy shit!

226
00:15:34,987 --> 00:15:36,867
<i>Eight more lives remain.</i>

227
00:16:02,907 --> 00:16:06,587
NO TRESPASSING
DANGER OF DEATH

228
00:16:11,987 --> 00:16:12,987
Shit.

229
00:16:21,187 --> 00:16:22,667
Looks like we're walking from here.

230
00:16:23,147 --> 00:16:24,867
- How far?
- I don't know.

231
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:30,467
Like a mile, maybe two-ish.

232
00:16:32,147 --> 00:16:33,147
REMAINS

233
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:36,687
Damn, it's hot.

234
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,067
You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

235
00:16:40,147 --> 00:16:41,347
We got enough water you think?

236
00:16:41,427 --> 00:16:43,787
Water check, harnesses check.

237
00:16:43,907 --> 00:16:45,907
Super bad-ass 4K drone check.

238
00:16:46,027 --> 00:16:48,307
Selfie stick, only essentials.

239
00:16:49,107 --> 00:16:50,107
Food?

240
00:16:50,147 --> 00:16:51,707
No, I'll be back in time before lunch.

241
00:16:51,827 --> 00:16:52,827
Oh, Jesus.

242
00:16:56,427 --> 00:16:57,987
Holy shit, they're big.

243
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:03,907
It's still alive.

244
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:05,467
Get off of him!

245
00:17:05,707 --> 00:17:07,587
Hey! Shoo! Shoo.

246
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:09,227
- Just go.
- Go.

247
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:17,267
Poor thing.

248
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,507
Pricks.

249
00:17:24,467 --> 00:17:26,027
Survival of the fittest, right?

250
00:17:27,827 --> 00:17:29,707
You'd do the same
if you were starving out here.

251
00:17:31,507 --> 00:17:33,067
Feeling peckish.

252
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:34,667
- Hunter.
- What?

253
00:17:35,107 --> 00:17:36,147
That's funny.

254
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:51,507
Holy shit, 300 likes.

255
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:52,707
Oh, wow.

256
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:55,067
350.

257
00:17:55,507 --> 00:17:57,907
I wonder how many
of your followers are serial killers?

258
00:18:01,307 --> 00:18:02,467
Holy shit.

259
00:18:03,947 --> 00:18:05,587
Looks a lot bigger up close, right?

260
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,587
It is sick.

261
00:18:11,427 --> 00:18:12,667
This is awful.

262
00:18:13,987 --> 00:18:16,747
Hey, guys, Danger D here,

263
00:18:16,831 --> 00:18:20,950
and we are at the foot
of the stomach turningly massive

264
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,463
fourth highest structure in the US.

265
00:18:23,547 --> 00:18:25,763
<i>We're gonna begin our grueling journey</i>

266
00:18:25,847 --> 00:18:30,059
within 1,800 foot ladder climb
inside a steel cage.

267
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,143
And then, after the cage we have
a 200-foot vertigo-inspiring mast

268
00:18:36,227 --> 00:18:37,507
to the external ladder.

269
00:18:37,947 --> 00:18:40,187
Your girls gonna be wide open
to the elements.

270
00:18:40,507 --> 00:18:44,627
And then, beyond that,
we have the precipice, the ledge,

271
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:46,867
<i>the top of the world.</i>

272
00:18:46,987 --> 00:18:48,027
Hunter.

273
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:53,307
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

274
00:18:53,907 --> 00:18:55,107
Babe, of course you can.

275
00:18:55,227 --> 00:18:56,867
No, I really can't, I'm like...

276
00:18:58,187 --> 00:18:59,747
I'm petrified, and I'm shaking.

277
00:19:00,867 --> 00:19:01,867
I'm here.

278
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:04,227
Take a breath.

279
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:09,227
After Dan died,
I was afraid of my own. Shadow.

280
00:19:10,267 --> 00:19:11,627
But I pushed through.

281
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:14,867
I overcame the fear, I took control.

282
00:19:16,267 --> 00:19:17,787
Do not let this fear consume you.

283
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:21,107
Come at it head on and kick its ass.

284
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:24,067
If you can beat it, you can beat anything.

285
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:27,947
And I am right here
beside you the whole time.

286
00:19:29,987 --> 00:19:31,987
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

287
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:35,947
So shut your shit, and let's do this.

288
00:19:38,787 --> 00:19:42,907
God, Hunter, you know that's the kind
of shit you should be posting on Instagram.

289
00:19:44,347 --> 00:19:45,347
Come on.

290
00:19:49,387 --> 00:19:51,267
Damn it, this is so cool.

291
00:19:51,747 --> 00:19:56,587
Holy shit. Look at this.

292
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
Damn it, Hunter,

293
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,827
you are such an asshole.

294
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,227
What are you getting us into?

295
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,267
Don't worry.

296
00:20:03,627 --> 00:20:05,507
We've got 50 feet of rope between us

297
00:20:05,627 --> 00:20:07,267
We are clipped in and we're all good.

298
00:20:08,943 --> 00:20:10,023
Okay.

299
00:20:10,107 --> 00:20:12,307
One leg at a time
and let me know if you have to rest.

300
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,467
Okay. Okay.

301
00:20:53,027 --> 00:20:55,427
See? It's easy.

302
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:00,627
Sure.

303
00:21:02,267 --> 00:21:03,867
You're doing a great, come on!

304
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:48,027
You okay?

305
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:50,827
No.

306
00:21:52,187 --> 00:21:54,587
You're doing a great, come on.

307
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,267
Hunter?

308
00:22:34,667 --> 00:22:35,747
- Hunter?
- Yeah?

309
00:22:36,187 --> 00:22:38,787
Can we rest a moment? I need a drink.

310
00:22:39,387 --> 00:22:40,387
Of course.

311
00:22:42,827 --> 00:22:44,387
The skylines mean we're half way up.

312
00:22:48,307 --> 00:22:49,307
Perfect spot.

313
00:22:51,387 --> 00:22:52,667
Do you wanna do something crazy?

314
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:55,187
What?

315
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:58,867
Half way up, that means
we've climbed about a 1,000 feet.

316
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:01,507
So, we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.

317
00:23:03,227 --> 00:23:04,827
Please don't say shit like that, Hunter.

318
00:23:07,547 --> 00:23:09,427
There's the motel, and the diner.

319
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:13,107
Now way, looks like a little toy town.

320
00:23:18,147 --> 00:23:19,347
Let's just get this over with.

321
00:23:19,627 --> 00:23:20,627
Yeah.

322
00:23:24,307 --> 00:23:25,987
Come on, catch up.

323
00:23:45,147 --> 00:23:48,587
That's it, Becky, you're doing amazing.

324
00:23:52,027 --> 00:23:53,027
Come on.

325
00:23:53,667 --> 00:23:55,067
Come on, Becky.

326
00:24:10,987 --> 00:24:12,187
Okay.

327
00:24:12,587 --> 00:24:14,627
This is the end of the internal ladder.

328
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:17,507
Each step at a time, okay? You got this.

329
00:24:19,187 --> 00:24:21,467
The next two hundred feet is external.

330
00:24:22,387 --> 00:24:24,387
I'm not gonna lie
it's gonna get a little bit crazy

331
00:24:24,461 --> 00:24:27,629
when we're out of the cage
in the open, but don't panic.

332
00:24:37,907 --> 00:24:38,907
Shit.

333
00:24:38,947 --> 00:24:40,067
Hunter?

334
00:24:40,627 --> 00:24:42,707
Hunter? Hunter?

335
00:24:43,027 --> 00:24:45,347
Becky, you gotta come up, it's so sick.

336
00:24:47,547 --> 00:24:48,547
Okay.

337
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:01,867
Hunter?

338
00:25:02,147 --> 00:25:05,307
Out here, it's just like 200 feet more.
That's all.

339
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:06,507
I can't.

340
00:25:07,147 --> 00:25:08,427
Yes, you can.

341
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:11,907
Just look up, only up.

342
00:25:16,867 --> 00:25:19,147
You're doing great. You got this.

343
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:23,667
Okay.

344
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:25,147
Okay.

345
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:36,907
Okay.

346
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:58,987
Yeah, you're killing it.

347
00:26:04,267 --> 00:26:05,347
You okay?

348
00:26:06,787 --> 00:26:07,987
Remember, only look up.

349
00:26:14,427 --> 00:26:15,627
What the hell are we doing?

350
00:26:16,547 --> 00:26:19,227
Hey, stop over thinking.

351
00:26:19,507 --> 00:26:20,507
How?

352
00:26:20,587 --> 00:26:26,987
I don't know, concentrate on something else,
like, sing a nursery rhyme or some shit.

353
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:32,867
Okay, okay.

354
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,060
<i>♪ Ring-a-ring-a-rosies,
a pocket full of posies ♪</i>

355
00:26:38,867 --> 00:26:42,347
<i>♪ A tissue, a tissue, we all fall down ♪</i>

356
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:46,387
I wouldn't have picked that one.

357
00:26:48,187 --> 00:26:49,187
Wow.

358
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:54,067
Okay, Bex, this is gonna look
a little bit worse than it is.

359
00:26:55,147 --> 00:26:57,267
What the hell, Hunter?
Let's just go back down.

360
00:27:02,147 --> 00:27:06,187
Becky, if I let you
go back down, fear wins.

361
00:27:06,747 --> 00:27:08,907
And I'm not going to let that happen.

362
00:27:42,947 --> 00:27:43,947
It's okay, Bex.

363
00:27:46,187 --> 00:27:47,187
It's okay.

364
00:27:47,227 --> 00:27:48,227
I've got your weight.

365
00:27:50,547 --> 00:27:52,187
Thanks, okay.

366
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:03,947
Okay.

367
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:10,627
Reach with your arm.

368
00:28:10,707 --> 00:28:11,747
Okay.

369
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:24,067
Okay, smooth our sailing to the top now.
You've got this.

370
00:28:26,587 --> 00:28:28,707
I actually really do hate you, Hunter.

371
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,947
Hey, does this ladder feel a little slack?

372
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:37,427
Stop, you dick, Hunter!

373
00:28:37,627 --> 00:28:38,627
Sorry.

374
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:46,267
What was that?

375
00:28:48,307 --> 00:28:50,387
Come on, we're almost there

376
00:28:54,147 --> 00:28:55,627
- Come on.
- Okay.

377
00:29:29,947 --> 00:29:32,163
Becky, you're not gonna believe this,
you gotta pull up here.

378
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,067
I'm coming.

379
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:34,387
Okay. Okay.

380
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:35,747
Okay.

381
00:29:42,667 --> 00:29:43,667
Hunter.

382
00:29:51,227 --> 00:29:52,707
Hey, trust me.

383
00:29:55,147 --> 00:29:56,467
Okay, okay.

384
00:30:00,907 --> 00:30:01,907
Becky.

385
00:30:07,387 --> 00:30:09,587
I'm here, oh, my God.

386
00:30:18,507 --> 00:30:19,627
Oh, my God.

387
00:30:20,427 --> 00:30:21,547
We did it, Bex.

388
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:22,747
I knew you could.

389
00:30:44,987 --> 00:30:46,067
Here we go!

390
00:30:50,707 --> 00:30:52,507
On top of the goddamn world.

391
00:30:57,387 --> 00:30:58,427
Do you want to try?

392
00:31:00,627 --> 00:31:01,827
Shit, Hunter, stop.

393
00:31:01,947 --> 00:31:03,387
Just focus on getting a good shot.

394
00:31:03,907 --> 00:31:05,547
I didn't wear this stupid bra for nothing

395
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:06,547
No.

396
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:07,667
No, Hunter.

397
00:31:09,947 --> 00:31:11,107
Fly it around.

398
00:31:13,593 --> 00:31:15,113
Take your time.

399
00:31:15,227 --> 00:31:16,987
Okay, oh my God.

400
00:31:28,827 --> 00:31:29,827
How did it look?

401
00:31:30,027 --> 00:31:32,347
Insane. Insane. Crazy.

402
00:31:34,427 --> 00:31:36,067
Let's get this bad boy back.

403
00:31:36,787 --> 00:31:39,387
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

404
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:43,731
Okay, now the ultimate, Bex, your turn.

405
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:50,507
What? No.

406
00:31:50,627 --> 00:31:52,347
Do you wanna kick fear in the dick or not?

407
00:31:52,627 --> 00:31:54,747
No, no, Hunter.

408
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,667
The old Becky would have done it.

409
00:31:59,507 --> 00:32:00,707
- Just saying.
- Dude.

410
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:03,867
Here, I'll hold your hand

411
00:32:09,747 --> 00:32:10,947
- Okay.
- Yeah.

412
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:12,387
Okay.

413
00:32:13,347 --> 00:32:14,347
Shit.

414
00:32:14,827 --> 00:32:16,267
Come on, come on.

415
00:32:17,787 --> 00:32:18,827
You can do this.

416
00:32:21,867 --> 00:32:22,907
You can do it.

417
00:32:23,747 --> 00:32:25,947
Okay, okay.

418
00:32:26,347 --> 00:32:27,347
I got you.

419
00:32:27,387 --> 00:32:28,427
Okay.

420
00:32:28,987 --> 00:32:29,987
Okay.

421
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:31,667
You can trust me.

422
00:32:31,747 --> 00:32:32,907
- Okay.
- I've got you, Bex.

423
00:32:33,027 --> 00:32:34,107
Oh, my God.

424
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:36,107
Careful over the ledge.

425
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:38,667
Take it easy.

426
00:32:39,107 --> 00:32:41,707
Okay. I've got you. I've got you.

427
00:32:41,907 --> 00:32:42,907
Okay.

428
00:32:47,827 --> 00:32:48,987
Open your eyes.

429
00:32:50,947 --> 00:32:51,947
Look up.

430
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:01,427
Okay, just one more.

431
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:07,587
Come up.

432
00:33:12,107 --> 00:33:13,147
Oh my God, I did it.

433
00:33:13,267 --> 00:33:15,747
You did it, you idiot.

434
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:19,587
Yes.

435
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,747
- Look, look how amazing these are.
- Oh my God.

436
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:30,787
Next time you are ever afraid of anything

437
00:33:31,307 --> 00:33:32,427
I want you to look at these,

438
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:34,907
And know that you have nothing
to be afraid of.

439
00:33:36,427 --> 00:33:37,507
Thank you.

440
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:38,747
Yeah.

441
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,307
You know I'm proud of you.

442
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:42,827
Dan would be too.

443
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:48,387
Yeah.

444
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:58,987
Okay, okay, it's time.

445
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,507
You and I, we're one, Dan.

446
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:43,547
And whenever I needed to laugh
you'd told me one of your shit jokes.

447
00:34:49,067 --> 00:34:51,667
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on it was yours.

448
00:34:55,107 --> 00:34:57,067
And now you're gone and uhm...

449
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:02,147
I don't feel whole anymore.

450
00:35:07,587 --> 00:35:10,667
I miss you, just so much and...

451
00:35:12,707 --> 00:35:14,067
I love you.

452
00:35:15,707 --> 00:35:16,787
Goodbye, Dan.

453
00:35:33,547 --> 00:35:34,547
Hey.

454
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:35,667
Sorry.

455
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:38,627
I just didn't expect
it to tip me like that.

456
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:40,667
Yeah.

457
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:43,187
It's been so far away for so long.

458
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:46,473
It just didn't really feel real
until then.

459
00:35:51,947 --> 00:35:52,947
Come on.

460
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:56,947
Let's get back down on Earth, okay?

461
00:35:58,387 --> 00:36:00,267
I don't know about
you but I really need to pee.

462
00:36:00,341 --> 00:36:02,583
I needed to pee
since we passed the Eiffel Tower.

463
00:36:03,587 --> 00:36:04,587
You okay?

464
00:36:04,987 --> 00:36:06,787
Okay, home time.

465
00:36:07,067 --> 00:36:08,147
Home time.

466
00:36:08,467 --> 00:36:10,307
- Harnesses?
- Harnesses.

467
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:17,067
Think of the ice cold beers
waiting for us.

468
00:36:17,587 --> 00:36:18,747
Oh, stop.

469
00:36:20,867 --> 00:36:21,867
I've got you.

470
00:36:21,907 --> 00:36:23,067
Okay, slowly.

471
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,020
Okay, I'm just gonna sit here.

472
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:28,427
Okay. Okay.

473
00:36:45,667 --> 00:36:46,667
Okay.

474
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:03,907
Hunter!

475
00:37:18,387 --> 00:37:19,507
No!

476
00:37:23,707 --> 00:37:26,387
Oh my God, oh my God, holy shit!

477
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:30,627
- Don't let down!
- No, I've got you.

478
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:33,067
Hunter!

479
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:42,467
Oh, God, please don't let go off me.

480
00:37:46,907 --> 00:37:47,907
Don't let go.

481
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:00,827
Bex?

482
00:38:05,907 --> 00:38:07,067
I've got you, Bex.

483
00:38:10,667 --> 00:38:11,907
I can see the ladder.

484
00:38:26,027 --> 00:38:27,067
I've got you.

485
00:38:31,587 --> 00:38:32,747
I just died almost.

486
00:38:36,307 --> 00:38:37,627
Oh, my God.

487
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:42,427
- Did that really just happen? Oh, my God.
- Jesus Christ.

488
00:38:43,147 --> 00:38:44,427
I wish we'd filmed that.

489
00:38:46,267 --> 00:38:47,267
You're here.

490
00:38:47,347 --> 00:38:49,987
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually peed myself.

491
00:38:50,187 --> 00:38:51,187
Yeah.

492
00:38:51,347 --> 00:38:52,507
Okay, take two.

493
00:38:54,387 --> 00:38:55,387
Okay.

494
00:39:01,627 --> 00:39:03,553
Oh, no.

495
00:39:03,637 --> 00:39:06,387
The ladder, it's gone.

496
00:39:23,667 --> 00:39:25,267
Hunter, how are we gonna get down?

497
00:39:26,507 --> 00:39:27,843
- Shit.
- Please tell me there's a way to get down.

498
00:39:27,867 --> 00:39:29,947
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a foothold on.

499
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,067
No.

500
00:39:31,107 --> 00:39:32,907
- Oh, no.
- No, no, no.

501
00:39:33,547 --> 00:39:35,507
There must be something.

502
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:39,987
No, shit, I don't have a signal.

503
00:39:43,147 --> 00:39:44,227
I don't get it either.

504
00:39:45,079 --> 00:39:47,636
I'm sure there's something.
I'm sure it's just really spotty up here.

505
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,723
No, we're too freaking high,
there's no signal up here.

506
00:39:49,747 --> 00:39:50,747
It'll be okay.

507
00:39:50,787 --> 00:39:53,523
Freaking out is not gonna help anything
right now, so just take a breath.

508
00:39:53,547 --> 00:39:56,547
We're stuck on the pizza-size platform
in the middle of nowhere., Hunter.

509
00:39:56,787 --> 00:39:58,627
Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.

510
00:39:59,307 --> 00:40:02,107
It's not gonna help, okay? It's okay.

511
00:40:04,147 --> 00:40:07,267
- I'm sure we can...
- Wait, Hunter, Hunter, look at this.

512
00:40:08,147 --> 00:40:09,147
Oh, my God.

513
00:40:09,827 --> 00:40:10,883
Binoculars, that's amazing.

514
00:40:10,907 --> 00:40:11,907
Okay.

515
00:40:12,747 --> 00:40:13,747
We have a flair.

516
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:15,427
Okay.

517
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:18,267
- Okay.
- This is great.

518
00:40:18,427 --> 00:40:19,427
OK, great.

519
00:40:27,627 --> 00:40:29,667
Oh, shit, our bag is down there.

520
00:40:31,187 --> 00:40:33,027
Oh, man, our water is in there.

521
00:40:34,627 --> 00:40:36,107
Shit, we're gonna die of thirst.

522
00:40:36,227 --> 00:40:37,227
No, no.

523
00:40:37,274 --> 00:40:39,523
We don't have water, that is how
you die when you're stranded.

524
00:40:39,547 --> 00:40:41,947
The noise, the noise that this thing made
when it crashed,

525
00:40:42,227 --> 00:40:44,027
there is no way nobody heard that.

526
00:40:45,147 --> 00:40:49,467
I am sure that there are like
multiple calls to 911 as we speak.

527
00:40:50,387 --> 00:40:51,467
Do you really think so?

528
00:40:52,427 --> 00:40:53,427
Yeah.

529
00:40:53,467 --> 00:40:56,467
Yeah, the cavalry is coming, okay?
We just have to wait.

530
00:40:57,147 --> 00:40:58,587
Okay. Okay.

531
00:41:01,107 --> 00:41:02,107
Holy fuck.

532
00:41:02,147 --> 00:41:04,387
- What, what?
- Becky, your leg, oh, my God.

533
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:09,507
What the hell? I didn't even notice this.

534
00:41:10,299 --> 00:41:12,459
Whoa.

535
00:41:12,733 --> 00:41:14,363
Give me your leg, let's do a tourniquet. ♪

536
00:41:14,387 --> 00:41:17,027
- It really hurts.
- Are you okay? I know, I'm sorry.

537
00:41:17,147 --> 00:41:18,707
- Can you warn me first?
- Okay.

538
00:41:19,067 --> 00:41:21,947
- Count to three or something.
- Okay, one, two, sorry.

539
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:23,347
I'm really sorry.

540
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:24,547
I know.

541
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:25,707
- Oh, man.
- Are you okay?

542
00:41:26,627 --> 00:41:28,907
Yeah, I mean, I'm like okay, it's like...

543
00:41:33,166 --> 00:41:34,373
I really need to pee.

544
00:41:35,687 --> 00:41:36,807
- Just go.
- No.

545
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:38,787
- Just go.
- No, it's fine, I can hold it.

546
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:40,787
Just getting comfortable.

547
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:52,107
Can you go any any further?
It's like spraying.

548
00:41:53,267 --> 00:41:55,187
- Okay, careful over the edge.
- I'm trying.

549
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:56,427
Stop looking at me.

550
00:41:57,027 --> 00:41:58,507
Oh, God, that's a relief.

551
00:41:59,947 --> 00:42:01,707
I'm just grateful you didn't need to shit.

552
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:05,372
Okay, we should find a way
to get comfortable

553
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,426
cause I think
we gonna be up here for a while.

554
00:42:09,507 --> 00:42:10,507
All right?

555
00:42:15,027 --> 00:42:16,107
All right.

556
00:42:22,427 --> 00:42:23,907
Do you really think someone's coming?

557
00:42:25,787 --> 00:42:27,267
One million percent.

558
00:43:06,107 --> 00:43:09,547
<i>Hey, Danger D, what's happening, guys?</i>

559
00:43:09,707 --> 00:43:12,187
<i>I'll tell you what's happening, Becky C.</i>

560
00:43:12,307 --> 00:43:15,627
<i>We are stuck at the top

561
00:43:15,747 --> 00:43:16,747
<i>with no way out.</i>

562
00:43:17,027 --> 00:43:19,947
<i>And I shot some of the best
goddamn footage of my life</i>

563
00:43:20,107 --> 00:43:21,107
<i>and no way to upload it.</i>

564
00:43:21,187 --> 00:43:23,107
<i>That's what worrying you
about the situation?</i>

565
00:43:24,107 --> 00:43:25,107
<i>It's quite ironic.</i>

566
00:43:25,507 --> 00:43:27,747
<i>Don't worry, you'll still be famous
if you fall.</i>

567
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:31,387
<i>As the girl who died taking a selfie,
now that is ironic.</i>

568
00:43:31,907 --> 00:43:34,547

this YouTube thing for the money,</i>

572
00:43:43,627 --> 00:43:45,587

she's just a like-whore.</i>

573
00:43:46,307 --> 00:43:48,307

574

show us Shilo Hunter.</i>

581
00:44:19,787 --> 00:44:23,907
What happened, it just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

582
00:44:26,947 --> 00:44:31,427
And I want to spread that message
that life is short, too short

583
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:34,547
so you gotta use every moment,

584
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:38,227
you gotta do something
that makes you feel alive.

585
00:44:48,347 --> 00:44:49,627
That was amazing.

586
00:44:51,427 --> 00:44:53,907
Wow, I mean, I told you
you should just be yourself.

587
00:44:54,027 --> 00:44:56,427
That was really great.

588
00:45:00,347 --> 00:45:01,547
Should I kill Danger D?

589
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:04,547
I'll help you bury the body.

590
00:45:21,307 --> 00:45:24,587
Oh, shit, there's like an old
RV thing down there.

591
00:45:24,787 --> 00:45:25,787
Can I see?

592
00:45:26,027 --> 00:45:27,547
Just past the gate, a little over.

593
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,627
Yeah, that looks abandoned.

594
00:45:34,787 --> 00:45:37,867
It's been five hours,
if anyone called 911 they'd be here by now.

595
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:55,947
Oh, my God.

596
00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:57,987
Holy shit.

597
00:45:58,107 --> 00:46:00,507
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,

598
00:46:00,947 --> 00:46:02,523
but we definitely did down there,
remember?

599
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:04,067
Remember, I got all those likes?

600
00:46:04,187 --> 00:46:05,187
Shit.

601
00:46:06,107 --> 00:46:07,107
Okay.

602
00:46:07,147 --> 00:46:08,963
Okay, so we don't know
at what point we lost service,

603
00:46:08,987 --> 00:46:09,890
maybe it was just up here

604
00:46:09,974 --> 00:46:13,183
because of some like interference
with the broadcast antenna.

605
00:46:13,267 --> 00:46:15,187
I think you're definitely
onto something, Hunter.

606
00:46:15,267 --> 00:46:16,587
Okay, we have 50 feet of rope.

607
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:18,547
- We can try to fish for coverage.
- Yeah.

608
00:46:18,667 --> 00:46:20,627
I just need something to secure this with.

609
00:46:21,027 --> 00:46:22,787
- My hair tie.
- Yeah, perfect.

610
00:46:23,187 --> 00:46:24,187
Okay.

611
00:46:25,067 --> 00:46:26,067
Okay.

612
00:46:26,107 --> 00:46:27,507
Can you message emergency services?

613
00:46:27,747 --> 00:46:30,307
I don't think so,
but I have over 60,000 followers.

614
00:46:30,427 --> 00:46:31,427
Okay.

615
00:46:31,467 --> 00:46:37,507
Help us, stuck on B67 tower, call 911.

616
00:46:38,227 --> 00:46:39,427
It's ready to post.

617
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:40,827
We should hear it when it sends.

618
00:46:47,187 --> 00:46:50,187
Come on, come on.

619
00:46:51,387 --> 00:46:53,667
Okay.

620
00:46:55,827 --> 00:46:57,547
Let me see if I can get it lower.

621
00:47:00,547 --> 00:47:01,787
Just be careful.

622
00:47:02,147 --> 00:47:03,307
- Got it.
- Okay.

623
00:47:03,827 --> 00:47:04,907
Come on.

624
00:47:10,187 --> 00:47:11,187
That's the end.

625
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:13,067
- I didn't hear anything.
- I didn't either.

626
00:47:13,467 --> 00:47:14,587
I don't think it posted.

627
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:19,267
Okay, maybe I can get it lower.

628
00:47:21,147 --> 00:47:22,227
What do you mean...

629
00:47:22,347 --> 00:47:23,547
I've got it. I've got an idea.

630
00:47:31,027 --> 00:47:32,027
Careful, Hunter.

631
00:47:32,347 --> 00:47:33,467
I feel solid.

632
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:36,707
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

633
00:47:42,507 --> 00:47:43,587
Okay.

634
00:47:44,227 --> 00:47:45,907
- Oh, my God.
- Shit.

635
00:47:46,027 --> 00:47:47,787
You're full of shit, oh, my God, Hunter.

636
00:47:48,627 --> 00:47:49,987
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

637
00:47:50,227 --> 00:47:51,227
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

638
00:47:54,387 --> 00:47:55,467
Careful, shit.

639
00:48:03,907 --> 00:48:05,307
I can not hear anything no thing

640
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:06,867
Okay, you need to come back up.

641
00:48:10,147 --> 00:48:11,147
Shit.

642
00:48:18,987 --> 00:48:19,987
I got it.

643
00:48:30,027 --> 00:48:31,187
Did it post?

644
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:33,547
No.

645
00:48:34,587 --> 00:48:36,267
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

646
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:43,587
Wait, hold on. We know
there's a signal at the base, for sure.

647
00:48:43,787 --> 00:48:44,787
Yeah.

648
00:48:44,871 --> 00:48:46,038
What if we just drop the phone...

649
00:48:46,062 --> 00:48:48,302
But what if my phone
just shatters into a million pieces?

650
00:48:48,347 --> 00:48:51,347
Not if we reenforce it somehow
so it doesn't, like the egg drop challenge.

651
00:48:51,507 --> 00:48:53,067
Yeah, okay, shit.

652
00:48:53,947 --> 00:48:55,667
We just need something to put in it.

653
00:48:55,787 --> 00:48:56,787
Yeah.

654
00:48:56,987 --> 00:48:57,987
This...

655
00:48:58,507 --> 00:48:59,507
It's melded on.

656
00:49:00,147 --> 00:49:01,307
My shoe is too clumsy.

657
00:49:01,627 --> 00:49:03,227
- Your shoe?
- Yeah, perfect.

658
00:49:05,187 --> 00:49:06,347
Okay, got it.

659
00:49:09,107 --> 00:49:10,107
We need some padding.

660
00:49:10,267 --> 00:49:11,387
Can we use your sock?

661
00:49:12,987 --> 00:49:14,587
Yeah, okay.

662
00:49:15,747 --> 00:49:16,747
Okay.

663
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:21,667
We still need something more substantial.

664
00:49:22,907 --> 00:49:25,387
Oh, Hunter, your push-up bra.

665
00:49:25,987 --> 00:49:27,307
That is more substantial.

666
00:49:27,827 --> 00:49:29,787
- Yeah.
- I'm trying to get this thing off anyway.

667
00:49:31,827 --> 00:49:33,347
Thank you, VS.

668
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:36,707
Okay.

669
00:49:36,827 --> 00:49:38,027
Hope it's strong enough.

670
00:49:38,187 --> 00:49:39,267
Shove it in, okay.

671
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:44,547
Okay.

672
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:48,227
Here comes nothing.

673
00:50:02,747 --> 00:50:04,907
- Did it work?
- I don't know, I can't tell.

674
00:50:19,587 --> 00:50:20,667
Do you see anything?

675
00:50:20,867 --> 00:50:22,347
No, nothing.

676
00:50:23,747 --> 00:50:24,747
Don't worry.

677
00:50:25,867 --> 00:50:27,027
They're coming.

678
00:50:33,227 --> 00:50:35,587
Holy shit, there's a freaking guy.

679
00:50:36,307 --> 00:50:38,307
- What?
- Oh, my God, yes!

680
00:50:38,427 --> 00:50:39,627
And a dog too.

681
00:50:41,347 --> 00:50:42,947
Hey, hey, help us!

682
00:50:43,067 --> 00:50:44,387
Up here!

683
00:50:46,867 --> 00:50:49,227
Look, I sent you the check, man, come on.

684
00:50:49,747 --> 00:50:50,867
I need that...

685
00:50:51,747 --> 00:50:52,747
Up here, boy.

686
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:02,107
Parker, come on, boy.

687
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:04,307
No no, no.

688
00:51:05,427 --> 00:51:08,707
Shit.

689
00:51:11,107 --> 00:51:12,187
Let's go

690
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,507
Goddamn it, they're getting away.

691
00:51:30,347 --> 00:51:31,467
Parker?

692
00:51:33,467 --> 00:51:34,587
He saw the shoe.

693
00:51:34,907 --> 00:51:36,507
Hey, up here!

694
00:51:45,307 --> 00:51:47,747
- Hey!
- Look up!

695
00:51:54,507 --> 00:51:55,947
No, no, no, turn around.

696
00:51:56,067 --> 00:51:57,747
- Turn around, where are you going?
- Shit.

697
00:51:59,547 --> 00:52:00,787
Shit, shit.

698
00:52:01,027 --> 00:52:02,227
Help!

699
00:52:04,627 --> 00:52:06,427
Wait, wait, do not fire the flare.

700
00:52:06,547 --> 00:52:07,547
He's not looking.

701
00:52:07,827 --> 00:52:08,963
This might be our only chance.

702
00:52:08,987 --> 00:52:10,267
No, no, no, he stopped looking.

703
00:52:12,707 --> 00:52:15,427
Wait, hold on, there's somebody by the RV.

704
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:18,187
He's setting up a grill or some shit.

705
00:52:18,347 --> 00:52:22,227
And we'll fire the flare when the sun
goes down, in like an hour.

706
00:52:22,347 --> 00:52:23,787
We've only got one shot at this.

707
00:52:25,507 --> 00:52:26,707
Oh, damn.

708
00:52:26,827 --> 00:52:27,827
What?

709
00:52:27,907 --> 00:52:29,387
They're making ribs.

710
00:52:29,507 --> 00:52:31,547
- Oh, no.
- And they have a really cold beer.

711
00:52:31,667 --> 00:52:32,787
Stop.

712
00:52:47,947 --> 00:52:49,627
These guys are definitely a couple.

713
00:52:51,307 --> 00:52:52,707
Dirty weekend away.

714
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,587
I'm jealous.

715
00:53:11,627 --> 00:53:13,627
Hey, they're finishing up.

716
00:53:14,267 --> 00:53:15,563
It's now or never, fire the flare.

717
00:53:15,587 --> 00:53:16,467
Is it dark enough?

718
00:53:16,587 --> 00:53:17,587
Uhuh.

719
00:53:17,907 --> 00:53:18,907
Okay.

720
00:53:20,076 --> 00:53:22,156
- Shit.
- Shit, what the hell. Why is it not firing?

721
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,560
I fired it, I cocked it,
but maybe there's a safety here...

722
00:53:24,674 --> 00:53:27,034
Shit, okay, they're going in,
you have to do the flare now.

723
00:53:27,147 --> 00:53:28,267
- I'm trying.
- Get it to go.

724
00:53:28,387 --> 00:53:29,387
Okay, I got it, I got it.

725
00:53:35,867 --> 00:53:37,609
Hey, Randy, come check this shit out.

726
00:53:37,907 --> 00:53:38,907
Okay, give me your phone.

727
00:53:39,587 --> 00:53:40,587
Okay.

728
00:53:42,027 --> 00:53:44,147
Hey, sons of bitches, out here!

729
00:53:44,987 --> 00:53:46,707
Holy shit, check this out.

730
00:53:48,153 --> 00:53:49,273
Up here!

731
00:53:49,427 --> 00:53:50,427
They're looking at us.

732
00:53:50,507 --> 00:53:51,507
- What?
- They can see us.

733
00:53:51,547 --> 00:53:52,547
Oh, my God!

734
00:53:52,707 --> 00:53:55,347
Shit, oh, my God, let me see. Let me see.

735
00:53:56,387 --> 00:53:57,707
Oh my God, they're coming.

736
00:54:03,827 --> 00:54:05,027
Holy shit, they found the car.

737
00:54:05,147 --> 00:54:06,707
They found our car, they found our car.

738
00:54:09,339 --> 00:54:10,819
They have a crowbar.

739
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:12,227
They probably can open the gate.

740
00:54:13,507 --> 00:54:14,547
- Okay.
- Okay.

741
00:54:14,827 --> 00:54:15,827
Wait, what the hell?

742
00:54:15,867 --> 00:54:16,947
Wait, what's going on?

743
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:18,387
They stopped.

744
00:54:18,707 --> 00:54:20,707
- What?
- Quit chatting, open the freaking gate!

745
00:54:21,627 --> 00:54:22,507
No.

746
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:25,347
No, what the hell?
They stealing my freaking car.

747
00:54:25,547 --> 00:54:27,427
- What?
- No, you sons of bitches!

748
00:54:27,787 --> 00:54:30,227
- No!
- You asshole, what the hell?

749
00:54:30,547 --> 00:54:32,076
- No.
- I have to see this.

750
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:35,147
Oh, my God.

751
00:54:35,426 --> 00:54:36,819
- No!
- Assholes!

752
00:55:26,867 --> 00:55:29,027
Okay, new rule.

753
00:55:30,507 --> 00:55:32,147
If somebody falls off the tower

754
00:55:32,747 --> 00:55:34,227
they bring the cell phone with them.

755
00:55:34,827 --> 00:55:36,227
And call for help on the way down.

756
00:55:38,907 --> 00:55:40,227
And maybe post that video.

757
00:55:42,027 --> 00:55:43,027
I'm kidding.

758
00:55:47,907 --> 00:55:51,147
Yeah, my leg, I could eat Aspirin
like Skittles right now.

759
00:55:52,805 --> 00:55:55,984
Yeah, looks like
it's getting a little funky.

760
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:58,445
You could use some washing, here.

761
00:56:09,147 --> 00:56:10,187
Sorry.

762
00:56:19,827 --> 00:56:21,067
We'll just keep it wrapped up.

763
00:56:24,307 --> 00:56:25,307
What's wrong?

764
00:56:28,987 --> 00:56:30,827
Dan could never say
the words "I love you."

765
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,483
143.

766
00:56:40,187 --> 00:56:41,387
143.

767
00:56:47,027 --> 00:56:48,027
Becky, I...

768
00:56:48,147 --> 00:56:49,187
How long?

769
00:56:53,027 --> 00:56:54,027
Four months.

770
00:56:59,187 --> 00:57:00,347
It was a huge mistake.

771
00:57:01,747 --> 00:57:05,027
I'm sorry, I am so, so sorry.

772
00:57:05,227 --> 00:57:07,707
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

773
00:57:07,827 --> 00:57:09,507
For falling in love with the same guy.

774
00:57:40,387 --> 00:57:41,387
Who made the move?

775
00:57:42,947 --> 00:57:44,547
- We were both super drunk.
- Who?

776
00:57:47,707 --> 00:57:48,707
He did.

777
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:54,267
But it was a huge, huge mistake, Bex.

778
00:57:57,587 --> 00:57:58,667
No.

779
00:57:59,827 --> 00:58:01,947
Mistake is a kiss or a one-night stand.

780
00:58:03,787 --> 00:58:05,627
You said you'd loved him, so...

781
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,187
It got out of hand.

782
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:14,307
I tried so hard not to
but I fell for him.

783
00:58:15,446 --> 00:58:17,027
He listened to me, he was...

784
00:58:18,387 --> 00:58:21,187
He was just different than every other
douche bag that I've ever dated.

785
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,307
And I had never felt that way before.

786
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:29,293
And then you asked me
to be your maid of honor

787
00:58:29,317 --> 00:58:32,717
and it all hit me like a ton of bricks
how messed up this all was.

788
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:36,427
I loved him but...

789
00:58:38,427 --> 00:58:40,667
But I love you more so I ended it.

790
00:58:44,867 --> 00:58:46,827
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

791
00:58:48,907 --> 00:58:50,347
And after Dan died, I...

792
00:58:51,387 --> 00:58:54,667
I just didn't have the strength
to be there for you.

793
00:58:54,787 --> 00:58:56,787
To be strong enough for you, so...

794
00:58:58,027 --> 00:58:59,107
So I ran away.

795
00:59:01,027 --> 00:59:02,987
And now you hate me and I don't blame you.

796
00:59:03,107 --> 00:59:05,547
And now we're stuck
on this stupid freaking tower

797
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:09,587
in the middle of freaking nowhere,
and it's all my fault.

798
00:59:11,587 --> 00:59:14,267
I am so, so sorry.

799
01:00:25,667 --> 01:00:26,867
What's that?

800
01:00:27,867 --> 01:00:30,187
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

801
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:33,907
It's been 24 hours.

802
01:00:37,147 --> 01:00:40,587
I think its time to accept that either
your 60,000 followers don't give a shit

803
01:00:40,707 --> 01:00:42,587
or your phone is down there
in a million pieces.

804
01:00:44,347 --> 01:00:49,227
Okay, well, we've got
one more shot, your phone.

805
01:00:49,787 --> 01:00:52,387
Yeah, no padding this time though,
even less of a chance.

806
01:00:52,507 --> 01:00:54,387
And if this fails
we really don't have any hope.

807
01:00:58,347 --> 01:01:00,027
How long till we die of thirst?

808
01:01:01,427 --> 01:01:04,587
It's just killing me that our water
is just right down there in that bag.

809
01:01:06,427 --> 01:01:07,467
Yeah, with the drone.

810
01:01:08,867 --> 01:01:10,203
We could have used that
to get help.

811
01:01:10,227 --> 01:01:13,707
We could have flown it back to our motel
with a good old-fashioned note.

812
01:01:19,787 --> 01:01:20,907
Hey, maybe I can get it.

813
01:01:22,747 --> 01:01:25,067
What do you mean?
You said it was too smooth, no footholds.

814
01:01:25,227 --> 01:01:27,067
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday

815
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:28,987
I think the rope
was long enough to reach it.

816
01:01:32,027 --> 01:01:33,307
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

817
01:01:35,547 --> 01:01:37,027
Yeah, I seriously think I can get it.

818
01:01:45,707 --> 01:01:47,507
Hunter, I don't think this is a good idea.

819
01:01:47,627 --> 01:01:49,147
Becky, I don't think we have a choice.

820
01:01:50,307 --> 01:01:51,947
Every hour that passes the weaker we get.

821
01:01:56,707 --> 01:02:00,027
Besides, maybe I get lucky and I'll fall.

822
01:02:11,227 --> 01:02:12,227
Hunter.

823
01:02:15,787 --> 01:02:16,787
Be careful.

824
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:20,667
I'm sorry, Bex.

825
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:23,467
I love you.

826
01:02:35,427 --> 01:02:36,427
Okay.

827
01:02:45,347 --> 01:02:46,707
Hunter, are you okay?

828
01:02:47,987 --> 01:02:48,987
Yeah.

829
01:02:50,027 --> 01:02:51,067
Yeah, all good.

830
01:02:58,987 --> 01:02:59,987
Okay.

831
01:03:06,467 --> 01:03:07,707
Okay.

832
01:03:15,187 --> 01:03:16,267
Hunter, be careful.

833
01:03:17,947 --> 01:03:19,107
Shit.

834
01:03:20,267 --> 01:03:21,907
I can't quite reach it.

835
01:03:22,587 --> 01:03:24,507
Just come back up and we'll tap it lower.

836
01:03:24,627 --> 01:03:25,627
Come on.

837
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:26,867
Shit.

838
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:31,947
I think I can drop myself lower.

839
01:03:32,307 --> 01:03:33,307
What?

840
01:03:34,507 --> 01:03:35,947
What the hell are you doing, Hunter?

841
01:03:38,027 --> 01:03:39,027
Hunter?

842
01:03:46,187 --> 01:03:47,187
Shit.

843
01:03:54,827 --> 01:03:56,347
I think I can swing to it.

844
01:03:56,467 --> 01:03:58,227
Hunter, no, Hunter.

845
01:03:58,587 --> 01:03:59,587
Come back up.

846
01:03:59,667 --> 01:04:00,707
Hunter, no!

847
01:04:01,107 --> 01:04:02,107
Hunter!

848
01:04:08,347 --> 01:04:09,347
Are you okay?

849
01:04:11,827 --> 01:04:12,867
Yeah.

850
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:18,747
Is there a way down?

851
01:04:19,547 --> 01:04:22,027
No, the ladder ripped all the way off.

852
01:04:33,507 --> 01:04:34,507
Water.

853
01:04:38,147 --> 01:04:39,027
Oh, my God.

854
01:04:39,147 --> 01:04:40,147
Wait, Hunter,

855
01:04:40,747 --> 01:04:42,307
how are you gonna get back on the rope?

856
01:04:48,307 --> 01:04:49,307
Shit.

857
01:04:51,747 --> 01:04:52,947
Can you reach it?

858
01:05:03,387 --> 01:05:05,787
<i>♪ Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall ♪</i>

859
01:05:06,947 --> 01:05:07,987
Oh, my God.

860
01:05:08,267 --> 01:05:10,587

861
01:05:22,947 --> 01:05:23,987
Shit.

862
01:05:28,507 --> 01:05:29,547
You okay?

863
01:05:29,747 --> 01:05:31,827
Yeah, I have an idea.

864
01:05:41,187 --> 01:05:42,347
Okay.

865
01:05:42,827 --> 01:05:44,707
I'm gonna try to hook it on with this.

866
01:05:45,067 --> 01:05:48,227
And then we're gonna work together
to pull me up, okay?

867
01:05:48,427 --> 01:05:52,067
That's amazing, that's
some good MacGyver shit right there.

868
01:06:19,627 --> 01:06:20,827
Come on, please, come on.

869
01:06:21,427 --> 01:06:22,427
Please, come on.

870
01:06:24,907 --> 01:06:25,907
You did it!

871
01:06:25,987 --> 01:06:27,667
Okay. Okay.

872
01:06:28,187 --> 01:06:29,627
I'm gonna jump onto this.

873
01:06:30,067 --> 01:06:31,827
I'm gonna need your help to pull me up.

874
01:06:32,467 --> 01:06:33,467
I think I'm ready, Bex.

875
01:06:33,547 --> 01:06:34,667
Okay.

876
01:06:36,387 --> 01:06:37,387
Okay.

877
01:06:40,587 --> 01:06:42,827
Okay, come on, come on
Come on, you can do it.

878
01:06:51,787 --> 01:06:52,867
Shit.

879
01:06:52,987 --> 01:06:54,827
Hunter, are you okay? You okay?

880
01:06:58,267 --> 01:06:59,987
I'm okay. I'm okay.

881
01:07:00,347 --> 01:07:01,987
Let's do this fast and quick, Becky.

882
01:07:02,187 --> 01:07:04,227
- We'll work together to pull me out.
- Okay.

883
01:07:04,347 --> 01:07:07,547
I climb, you pull, okay?

884
01:07:08,467 --> 01:07:09,867
Okay, now.

885
01:07:39,467 --> 01:07:41,107
I can almost reach the ladder.

886
01:07:46,147 --> 01:07:47,547
Almost there, Bex.

887
01:07:54,347 --> 01:07:55,387
Okay.

888
01:08:25,506 --> 01:08:27,546
Becky, I landed on the bag.

889
01:08:27,667 --> 01:08:29,386
Oh, my God, are you okay?

890
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:33,227
I hurt my hands, real bad,
I don't think I can climb.

891
01:08:33,386 --> 01:08:34,947
You're gonna have to pull me up, okay?

892
01:08:35,147 --> 01:08:36,506
Okay. Okay.

893
01:08:40,027 --> 01:08:41,147
I got you.

894
01:09:17,307 --> 01:09:18,307
Shit.

895
01:09:21,307 --> 01:09:22,667
No, are you okay?

896
01:09:23,346 --> 01:09:24,346
Yeah.

897
01:09:24,386 --> 01:09:25,466
I thought you died there.

898
01:09:25,907 --> 01:09:27,107
I'm not going anywhere, Bex.

899
01:09:28,426 --> 01:09:30,067
Yeah, that was scary.

900
01:09:37,386 --> 01:09:38,386
We should ration it.

901
01:09:39,190 --> 01:09:40,190
Yeah, you're right.

902
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:42,426
Is there food in there?

903
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:45,107
No, it's just your cherry lip balm.

904
01:09:45,947 --> 01:09:47,187
I don't think you can eat that.

905
01:09:48,187 --> 01:09:49,867
Okay, it's getting dark.

906
01:09:49,987 --> 01:09:51,587
I think it's now or never on that drone.

907
01:09:52,907 --> 01:09:55,267
I think we need...
We need to write a note.

908
01:09:56,427 --> 01:09:57,747
Okay, the receipt from the diner.

909
01:09:58,587 --> 01:09:59,827
Pen, do you have a pen?

910
01:09:59,947 --> 01:10:00,947
Eyeliner in here.

911
01:10:01,987 --> 01:10:03,467
Aren't you glad I brought makeup now?

912
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:07,507
Help.

913
01:10:07,667 --> 01:10:12,627
Stuck on top of B67 tower. Call 911.

914
01:10:13,187 --> 01:10:14,187
Okay.

915
01:10:14,587 --> 01:10:15,587
Yeah, perfect.

916
01:10:19,787 --> 01:10:20,787
Okay.

917
01:10:20,947 --> 01:10:21,947
See that?

918
01:10:22,107 --> 01:10:25,507
That's the road where we almost got
wiped out. It leads to the motel.

919
01:10:26,867 --> 01:10:28,467
Let's do this while we still have light.

920
01:10:32,307 --> 01:10:33,307
Okay.

921
01:10:35,987 --> 01:10:39,467
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the rode...

922
01:10:39,587 --> 01:10:40,667
Okay.

923
01:10:55,347 --> 01:10:57,027
Okay, we're almost past the gate.

924
01:10:58,027 --> 01:10:59,307
- Oh my God, no, no.
- What?

925
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:01,940
- The battery, it's running out of juice.
- Shit.

926
01:11:02,307 --> 01:11:04,227
Hit "retrieve." Has it gone too far?

927
01:11:04,707 --> 01:11:06,387
- Is it gonna make it?
- There's no chance.

928
01:11:06,580 --> 01:11:08,290
- Are you sure?
- It's not even at the gate.

929
01:11:08,314 --> 01:11:09,514
Oh, shit, it's falling.

930
01:11:09,620 --> 01:11:10,860
Hit "retrieve," hit "retrieve".

931
01:11:10,987 --> 01:11:11,987
Okay.

932
01:11:13,046 --> 01:11:14,526
- It's coming back.
- Fly it high.

933
01:11:14,667 --> 01:11:16,243
Give it your best shot
to get it back to us.

934
01:11:16,267 --> 01:11:18,067
Come on, just get it higher,
higher, higher.

935
01:11:19,787 --> 01:11:21,707
- Just get it higher.
- I'm trying.

936
01:11:22,707 --> 01:11:23,963
We'll grab it when it gets close.

937
01:11:23,987 --> 01:11:24,987
Okay.

938
01:11:28,507 --> 01:11:32,427
Okay, grab it, Bex. Get it!

939
01:11:36,067 --> 01:11:38,027
Nice, great job.

940
01:11:50,427 --> 01:11:52,267
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

941
01:11:53,227 --> 01:11:55,987
Maybe just turn it off
and once it's rested it'll have more juice?

942
01:11:56,267 --> 01:11:58,467
It's never gonna be enough, Hunter.

943
01:12:07,947 --> 01:12:08,947
What are we gonna do?

944
01:12:09,627 --> 01:12:11,027
Hey, we're not gonna panic.

945
01:12:11,987 --> 01:12:13,227
We're gonna stay calm.

946
01:12:14,027 --> 01:12:15,147
We're gonna figure it out.

947
01:12:15,667 --> 01:12:16,907
Okay, there's gotta be a way.

948
01:12:20,627 --> 01:12:21,907
Are we gonna die?

949
01:12:22,627 --> 01:12:25,427
No, we're gonna be okay.

950
01:12:53,987 --> 01:12:55,227
Hunter? Hunter?

951
01:12:56,347 --> 01:12:57,667
Where are you? Hunter?

952
01:13:05,107 --> 01:13:06,107
Hunter?

953
01:13:07,547 --> 01:13:08,907
Hunter, where are you?

954
01:13:13,227 --> 01:13:14,267
Hunter.

955
01:13:14,627 --> 01:13:15,787
Hunter?

956
01:14:15,667 --> 01:14:18,907
Becky, it's okay,
you just had a bad dream.

957
01:14:19,867 --> 01:14:21,587
You're nice and safe.

958
01:14:22,067 --> 01:14:24,547
Two thousand feet up
in the middle of nowhere.

959
01:14:33,467 --> 01:14:34,547
I have an idea.

960
01:14:35,587 --> 01:14:36,867
How to charge the drone.

961
01:14:38,467 --> 01:14:39,667
Your dumb life hack.

962
01:14:41,027 --> 01:14:42,787
Becky, you're freaking genius.

963
01:14:49,627 --> 01:14:52,027
I think it's light enough now.
Let's do it.

964
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:13,820
Okay, it's a standard bulb fitting,
it's gonna be hot.

965
01:15:14,307 --> 01:15:16,587
It's 30 feet
but it's gonna feel like a thousand.

966
01:15:20,547 --> 01:15:21,707
- Is your leg okay?
- Yeah.

967
01:15:22,587 --> 01:15:25,107
It smells, but it doesn't
hurt anymore, it's fine.

968
01:15:26,627 --> 01:15:27,707
Okay.

969
01:15:31,387 --> 01:15:32,387
You can do this.

970
01:15:41,187 --> 01:15:42,227
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

971
01:15:46,147 --> 01:15:47,467
Keep going, Becky.

972
01:15:52,267 --> 01:15:53,307
You can do this, Becky.

973
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:04,907
I can't.

974
01:16:05,267 --> 01:16:06,307
It's okay, it's okay.

975
01:16:06,427 --> 01:16:07,427
I can't.

976
01:16:08,347 --> 01:16:09,587
You can do it, Becky.

977
01:16:10,347 --> 01:16:11,547
You got it.

978
01:16:14,947 --> 01:16:17,747
It's okay, it's just like pole dancing.

979
01:16:18,667 --> 01:16:20,707
Okay, "Cherry Pie."

980

01:16:43,587 --> 01:16:45,547
Becky's my cherry pie.

987
01:16:47,027 --> 01:16:48,067
Yes.

988
01:16:56,747 --> 01:16:59,307
Okay. Okay.

989
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:00,640
Yeah.

990
01:17:00,747 --> 01:17:02,427
You did it, my cherry pie!

991
01:17:04,667 --> 01:17:05,707
Okay.

992
01:17:06,667 --> 01:17:08,267
- Okay.
- Remember it's hot.

993
01:17:08,387 --> 01:17:09,387
Okay. Okay.

994
01:17:11,467 --> 01:17:12,467
Be careful.

995
01:17:30,387 --> 01:17:32,107
Okay, just think back to the diner.

996
01:17:32,547 --> 01:17:34,786
You'll gonna wanna align
the prongs of the charger

997
01:17:34,870 --> 01:17:37,447
with the element in the bulb socket.

998
01:17:42,307 --> 01:17:43,587
I don't think it's long enough.

999
01:17:44,267 --> 01:17:45,947
I think the back prong doesn't reach.

1000
01:17:46,067 --> 01:17:50,107
Okay, you're gonna need something small
and metal to carry the current, like...

1001
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:53,107
Like a screw or something
you can jam in there.

1002
01:17:53,867 --> 01:17:55,427
- There isn't anything.
- Jesus.

1003
01:18:23,827 --> 01:18:26,467
It's working, it's freaking working.

1004
01:18:26,707 --> 01:18:28,067
Holy shit, my hero.

1005
01:18:28,787 --> 01:18:30,747
Okay, we're gonna need a full charge.

1006
01:18:30,867 --> 01:18:33,427
I don't know, it just has four lights.

1007
01:18:33,707 --> 01:18:37,067
Okay, we have to charge it all the way,
give ourselves the best shot.

1008
01:18:37,547 --> 01:18:38,587
You gonna be okay?

1009
01:18:39,027 --> 01:18:41,307
Yeah, I got this.

1010
01:19:10,347 --> 01:19:11,507
You okay?

1011
01:19:12,667 --> 01:19:13,747
Yeah.

1012
01:19:14,067 --> 01:19:15,267
Hang in there, Bex.

1013
01:19:16,587 --> 01:19:17,907
Passed half way.

1014
01:19:38,547 --> 01:19:39,547
Here about me

1015
01:19:47,627 --> 01:19:50,147
It's okay, it's okay,
Becky, you've got it.

1016
01:19:51,867 --> 01:19:53,107
Three lights.

1017
01:19:57,387 --> 01:19:59,147
Come on, Becky, you're so close.

1018
01:20:07,187 --> 01:20:08,187
Get away from me!

1019
01:20:14,267 --> 01:20:15,307
You did it.

1020
01:20:20,147 --> 01:20:21,427
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

1021
01:20:25,747 --> 01:20:26,947
Why didn't you catch the bag?

1022
01:20:29,108 --> 01:20:30,915
Babe, you're okay?

1023
01:20:36,907 --> 01:20:39,627
We need to fly that thing
when the motel is the busiest.

1024
01:20:40,147 --> 01:20:44,027
Check out, 10 a.m, just a couple of hours.

1025
01:21:11,627 --> 01:21:14,707
Yeah, he was right about Dan,
he was just trying to help me.

1026
01:21:17,974 --> 01:21:19,747
And I was so horrible to him.

1027
01:21:23,023 --> 01:21:25,463
If there was anyone
I could text it'd be him.

1028
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:29,587
Just to tell him I'm so sorry.

1029
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:33,387
I love him.

1030
01:21:40,067 --> 01:21:41,187
I'm tapping outta here.

1031
01:21:42,467 --> 01:21:45,907
Stay with me,
try to keep your mind occupied.

1032
01:21:47,267 --> 01:21:51,267
Tell me something, something
that you and your dad used to do together.

1033
01:21:55,027 --> 01:21:56,507
We would watch wrestling.

1034
01:21:58,027 --> 01:21:59,187
WWE.

1035
01:21:59,307 --> 01:22:02,267
Yeah, I forgot you guys were into that.

1036
01:22:03,147 --> 01:22:04,147
Yeah.

1037
01:22:04,507 --> 01:22:05,707
We both like it, you know.♪♪

1038
01:22:06,707 --> 01:22:11,307
He always said I'd be world champion
with my fighting spirit.

1039
01:22:12,947 --> 01:22:15,187
I always felt so close to him
when we were watching it.

1040
01:22:18,867 --> 01:22:20,787
Name some of your favorite wrestlers.

1041
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:26,667
Stone Cold - Steve Austin.

1042
01:22:28,507 --> 01:22:29,547
The Rock.

1043
01:22:30,627 --> 01:22:33,827
What was Cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing a mask?

1044
01:22:34,107 --> 01:22:35,307
Mankind.

1045
01:22:36,787 --> 01:22:38,107
Mankind.

1046
01:22:39,947 --> 01:22:41,787
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

1047
01:22:41,987 --> 01:22:43,027
I didn't.

1048
01:22:43,667 --> 01:22:45,107
Keep going, you need to stay awake.

1049
01:22:47,987 --> 01:22:48,987
Batista.

1050
01:22:49,267 --> 01:22:50,643
Sub. T

1051
01:22:55,027 --> 01:22:56,747
Okay, it's check out time.

1052
01:23:00,347 --> 01:23:01,427
Here it goes.

1053
01:23:08,633 --> 01:23:11,313
Just keep that shit straight,
follow the line of the road.

1054
01:23:16,667 --> 01:23:18,067
Come on, you son of a...

1055
01:23:24,187 --> 01:23:28,707
We've passed the point of no return.
How's the battery? Should I retrieve?

1056
01:23:29,307 --> 01:23:30,987
No, keep going.

1057
01:23:34,307 --> 01:23:36,067
Come on, come on, just follow the road.

1058
01:23:43,267 --> 01:23:44,267
Oh, shit.

1059
01:23:50,747 --> 01:23:51,827
It's gonna work.

1060
01:24:00,067 --> 01:24:02,147
Oh, God.

1061
01:24:05,187 --> 01:24:11,427
No. Screw your truck, get the drone!
Get it!

1062
01:24:17,067 --> 01:24:20,227
No, no, come back.

1063
01:24:21,787 --> 01:24:24,147
No, no.

1064
01:24:24,267 --> 01:24:25,267
No, come back.

1065
01:24:25,507 --> 01:24:26,587
Come back.

1066
01:24:27,987 --> 01:24:29,187
No.

1067
01:24:31,646 --> 01:24:33,539
Fuck, no!

1068
01:25:20,427 --> 01:25:21,747
Is this a storm?

1069
01:25:24,067 --> 01:25:25,827
It's kinda beautiful from up here.

1070
01:25:31,947 --> 01:25:33,907
I can't survive another night.

1071
01:25:34,347 --> 01:25:35,667
Becky, don't talk like that.

1072
01:25:39,667 --> 01:25:42,267
I just want to sleep.

1073
01:25:42,427 --> 01:25:43,587
You can't sleep.

1074
01:25:44,147 --> 01:25:45,987
The vultures, they can smell your leg.

1075
01:25:46,667 --> 01:25:48,787
They're waiting for you to give up
so they can attack.

1076
01:25:52,427 --> 01:25:54,027
Survival of the fittest.

1077
01:25:55,267 --> 01:25:58,547
You need energy, we should eat something.

1078
01:25:59,307 --> 01:26:00,307
What?

1079
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:04,324
We're 2,000 feet up
in the middle of the desert

1080
01:26:04,415 --> 01:26:05,909
There's no food up here.

1081
01:26:06,347 --> 01:26:07,387
There is always something.

1082
01:26:10,867 --> 01:26:12,230
It's hopeless.

1083
01:26:16,461 --> 01:26:17,934
Let's send another message.

1084
01:26:18,707 --> 01:26:20,787
We can pad the cell better this time.

1085
01:26:21,187 --> 01:26:22,187
With what?

1086
01:26:22,227 --> 01:26:23,227
Give me your shoe.

1087
01:26:23,627 --> 01:26:25,427
- I can't.
- Why?

1088
01:26:25,987 --> 01:26:27,147
It's not up here, is it?

1089
01:26:27,387 --> 01:26:28,507
What?

1090
01:26:30,907 --> 01:26:31,907
It's down there.

1091
01:26:33,587 --> 01:26:34,987
It's on your foot.

1092
01:26:36,587 --> 01:26:37,903
Yes.

1093
01:26:39,497 --> 01:26:41,257
But I am...

1094
01:26:42,188 --> 01:26:45,198
down there, remember?

1095
01:26:50,867 --> 01:26:51,867
I fell.

1096
01:26:55,267 --> 01:26:57,227
You can't have the shoe

1097
01:26:58,027 --> 01:26:59,867
because I didn't catch the bag.

1098
01:27:00,987 --> 01:27:02,227
I bled out.

1099
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:22,387
You didn't really think your scrawny ass
could pull me up, did you?

1100
01:27:35,827 --> 01:27:37,107
You pulled the bag up.

1101
01:27:46,187 --> 01:27:51,346
I guess you were just too afraid
to realize that you were up here

1102
01:27:51,506 --> 01:27:53,293
all alone.

1103
01:29:05,787 --> 01:29:10,987
<i>Hi Dad, I wanted you to know that I...</i>

1104
01:29:11,827 --> 01:29:13,747
<i>I found my fight again.</i>

1105
01:29:17,947 --> 01:29:19,347
<i>Please leave your message.</i>

1106
01:29:20,747 --> 01:29:25,027
<i>I wanna live, I wanna go home.</i>

1107
01:29:27,787 --> 01:29:29,587
<i>But I'm not gonna make it.</i>

1108
01:29:35,547 --> 01:29:38,027
<i>You were right about everything and I...</i>

1109
01:29:39,467 --> 01:29:40,907
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

1110
01:29:42,947 --> 01:29:46,667
Becky, call me when you're ready,
I'm here for you, Dad.

1111
01:29:46,787 --> 01:29:48,627
<i>By the time you see this</i>

1112
01:29:51,347 --> 01:29:52,467
<i>I'll be gone.</i>

1113
01:30:00,427 --> 01:30:01,427
<i>I love you.</i>

1114
01:31:33,787 --> 01:31:34,787
Thus

1115
01:31:58,987 --> 01:32:02,587
<i>You need energy, you should eat something.</i>

1116
01:32:07,227 --> 01:32:08,987
<i>Survival of the fittest.</i>

1117
01:32:44,787 --> 01:32:46,947
<i>I can pad the cell better this time.</i>

1118
01:32:48,267 --> 01:32:49,427
<i>Give me your shoe.</i>

1119
01:34:05,347 --> 01:34:06,347
Hunter.

1120
01:34:19,867 --> 01:34:21,107
God, I love you.

1121
01:34:34,587 --> 01:34:37,387
Help, stuck on the B67 tower,
I love you Dad, Becky.

1122
01:34:53,147 --> 01:34:54,307
I'm sorry.

1123
01:34:54,987 --> 01:34:58,227
I'm so sorry, but I really have to
make sure this gets through.

1124
01:34:58,507 --> 01:35:00,067
God, God, I'm sorry.

1125
01:36:16,827 --> 01:36:17,867
You can't walk here.

1126
01:36:17,987 --> 01:36:20,267
Becky, Becky?

1127
01:36:26,227 --> 01:36:29,707
No, no.

1128
01:36:32,547 --> 01:36:37,787
Dad? Dad? Dad.

1129
01:36:44,507 --> 01:36:45,707
Jesus, I thought that was you.

1130
01:36:46,907 --> 01:36:48,227
Dad, I love you.

1131
01:36:48,387 --> 01:36:50,267
And I'm so sorry.

1132
01:36:51,827 --> 01:36:57,547
It's okay, I just want you to be okay.

1133
01:37:01,907 --> 01:37:06,267
I am, you know. I'm gonna be okay, really.

1134
01:37:21,827 --> 01:37:22,987
Let's go home.

1135
01:37:25,827 --> 01:37:26,987
<i>Life is fleeting.</i>

1136
01:37:28,147 --> 01:37:31,187
<i>Life is short, too short.</i>

1137
01:37:31,587 --> 01:37:34,187
<i>So you gotta use every moment.</i>

1138
01:37:34,867 --> 01:37:37,427
<i>You have to do something
that makes you feel alive,</i>

1139
01:37:37,987 --> 01:37:41,987
<i>and that shit,
that would spread that message</i>

1140
01:37:42,147 --> 01:37:43,667
<i>far and wide.</i>
