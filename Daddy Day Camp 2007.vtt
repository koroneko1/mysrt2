01:37.347 --> 01:38.514
Got some.

02:30.650 --> 02:34.236
- Dad peed in his pants.
- Get used to it, son.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.572
When I'm old,
you'll have to change my diaper.

02:42.412 --> 02:45.247
Another year over.
I can't believe it.

02:45.415 --> 02:47.249
I can't believe our sons are 7.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.918
In a couple years,
they'll be starting a band...

02:50.086 --> 02:51.587
...growing their hair long...

02:51.754 --> 02:53.714
...stealing your Suburban
to go on tour.

02:55.758 --> 02:59.052
Charlie, we have ourselves
a situation.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.554
Okay, I'll be a minute.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.847
Phil. Phil.

03:03.516 --> 03:06.435
Rare. Good. See?

03:07.770 --> 03:09.938
Save room for cake.

03:17.906 --> 03:21.283
Never mind that on the cake.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.788
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, slow down.

03:26.956 --> 03:31.293
It was the end of Summer Olympiad
between us and our rival camp.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.629
The final event: The relay race.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.840
Coming down the stretch,
I was flying like the wind.

03:37.008 --> 03:38.675
You were sweating sheets of rain.

03:38.843 --> 03:40.761
You could barely move
in a straight line.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.804
- I was still in the lead.
- Whatever.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.807
I hand the baton to Charlie,
he drops it, we lose everything.

03:45.975 --> 03:49.269
Then Lance Warner flew
right past you to the finish line.

03:49.437 --> 03:53.482
I hated that snot-nosed little brat.
He's why I didn't have a good time.

03:54.692 --> 03:58.403
Honey, why is Ben going on and on
about going off to camp?

03:58.571 --> 04:01.198
The permission slip's been
on the fridge for three weeks.

04:01.366 --> 04:03.784
He really Wants to go,
and I think he should.

04:03.952 --> 04:07.120
Well, Phil and I have talked,
the boys aren't going.

04:07.288 --> 04:09.998
- What do you mean?
- I mean, they're not going.

04:10.166 --> 04:12.501
All those snakes and spiders
and wedgies.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.504
Just because you had
a bad experience as a kid at camp...

04:15.672 --> 04:17.798
...doesn't mean
our son Will have one too.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.760
- What are you talking about?
- I was there. You were scarred for life.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.346
I'm on the ground,
staring up at my father.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.515
He stands there
with a look of disapproval.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.518
Just over some stupid camp game.

04:29.686 --> 04:33.522
I won't allow my son to let
anything like that happen to him.

04:33.690 --> 04:37.150
He will know I love and support him
no matter what.

04:38.027 --> 04:41.196
Good. Then you can love
and support him going to camp.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.657
You didn't hear what I just said?

04:43.825 --> 04:48.453
Yes, I did, and he's not you, and
you definitely are not your father.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.541
Oh, and you're driving them.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.020
There it is. Camp Canola.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.816
You don't want to
go to rival Canola.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.568
But that's where everyone goes.

05:19.736 --> 05:22.904
No, if you Wanna go to camp,
you wanna go to Driftwood.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.324
Yeah, Camp Canola's
some rundown shack...

05:25.491 --> 05:27.242
...on a piece of swamp land.

05:45.261 --> 05:47.763
At least, it used to be.

05:53.269 --> 05:56.438
- Cool.
- Awesome.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.658
It's a lake.
I don't remember a lake.

06:13.289 --> 06:15.207
Well, this ain't nothing.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.292
Wait till you see
where you are going.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.794
Camp Driftwood.

06:32.100 --> 06:33.475
What the heck?

06:40.316 --> 06:43.318
Yeah, well, you're crazy, Morty.
That's the best offer...

06:43.486 --> 06:45.654
...you're ever gonna get
for this craphole.

06:45.822 --> 06:49.991
I'm doing you a favour, butthead.
You're crazy, Morty.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.829
- Are you folks lost?
- No, we're here to check out the camp.

06:55.331 --> 06:58.333
You want to bring your kids here?

07:01.337 --> 07:04.089
That's beautiful.

07:04.841 --> 07:05.882
Yeah.

07:07.927 --> 07:10.804
Hey, good luck with that.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.396
Okay, kids, come on.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.815
Didn't you hear? Camp's closed.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.108
- Yes.
- Yes.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.153
What happened?
This place used to be the best.

07:26.320 --> 07:30.031
Well, now seems like everybody
wants newer, better...

07:30.199 --> 07:32.701
...properly licensed and bonded.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.204
They want Camp Canola
down the road.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.873
You guys went to Driftwood?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.708
Yeah, we were here
when we were kids.

07:39.876 --> 07:44.212
Then you know. This place really
used to be something special.

07:44.380 --> 07:48.383
And Canola Was a dump.
Then some rich family bought it...

07:48.551 --> 07:52.345
...eventually turned it over
to that mutant son of theirs.

07:52.513 --> 07:54.264
What's gonna happen to Driftwood?

07:54.432 --> 07:57.726
Well, soon I'm gonna have no choice
but to sell it to Canola.

07:57.894 --> 08:02.397
It's a pity. Because all he Wants
to do is bulldoze over it.

08:02.565 --> 08:03.899
Can you believe it?

08:04.066 --> 08:07.861
That kid has been a pain in my heinie
since he won the '77 Olympiad.

08:08.571 --> 08:12.574
I just hate to give that jerk
Lance Warner the satisfaction.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.077
Warner? Lance Warner?

08:16.245 --> 08:18.246
He wants to buy this camp
and tear it down?

08:18.414 --> 08:19.456
Our camp?

08:19.624 --> 08:21.082
You bought a What?

08:21.250 --> 08:24.085
Not the whole camp, a partnership
with the original owner.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.922
I know the day care centre
has been successful...

08:27.089 --> 08:29.508
...but you've spent a lot
fixing this house up...

08:29.675 --> 08:31.009
...to accommodate more kids.

08:31.177 --> 08:34.429
The Daddy Day Care brand
means a lot in this town.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.432
Re-purposing that brand into summer
is just smart business.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.183
Do you know how to run a camp?

08:39.352 --> 08:42.812
That's just it. I'm not gonna run
the camp, Uncle Morty is.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.773
Phil and I are just gonna help out.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.275
So I'll spend as much time
with Ben as possible.

08:47.443 --> 08:48.944
But you hate the outdoors.

08:49.111 --> 08:53.114
Yes, but I hate Lance Warner more.
No way my son's going to his camp.

08:53.282 --> 08:56.952
Please just send him to Canola.
That's where all his friends are.

08:57.119 --> 08:58.245
No. No way.

08:59.872 --> 09:05.293
Listen, my father sent me to camp
and it didn't go so great. Okay?

09:05.461 --> 09:08.964
Maybe I can give Ben
the positive experience I never had.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.135
Just promise me you'll let...

09:14.303 --> 09:16.805
...this Uncle Morty do
the real outdoorsy stuff.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.974
I don't wanna have to send
a search party...

09:19.141 --> 09:21.643
...to come rescue your lost butt
in the woods.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.401
Come on, Sally, now,
don't play hard to get.

09:29.569 --> 09:30.986
Oh, you little tease.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.655
Oh, you... I've gotcha.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.910
It's another beautiful
woodchuck day, baby.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.830
Hey, that's great.
You remember the old cheer.

09:41.998 --> 09:45.667
I can't thank you guys enough.
I mean, you saved the old place.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.503
Yeah, well, with your help,
I'll show that Lance Warner...

09:48.671 --> 09:50.797
...how to run a good
old-fashioned summer camp.

09:50.965 --> 09:53.258
Swell. I'll see you guys
in September.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.467
Say what, now?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.012
Uncle Morty?

09:58.681 --> 10:01.850
Excuse me. Morty, you can't leave.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.103
You're supposed to be overseeing
the camp. We're partners.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.522
I've been Watching over this camp
for 30 years.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.358
It's time I took a
vacation, partner.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.694
Don't worry.
Dale here will show you the ropes.

10:12.862 --> 10:16.865
- He's the best counselor I got.
- No, Morty, wait. You can't leave.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.701
Wait. Come back.

10:28.502 --> 10:31.004
What was that about?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.340
This is my first day.

10:48.230 --> 10:49.981
Charles Hinton?

10:50.149 --> 10:53.193
- I'm Charlie.
- I'm from FMJ Bank.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.446
No doubt your uncle Morty
informed you of the liens...

10:56.614 --> 10:59.366
- ...we have against your property.
- Informed?

10:59.533 --> 11:01.576
He just took his little fishy
up the road.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.244
As the business has no clients...

11:03.412 --> 11:05.538
...therefore no discernible
means of income...

11:05.706 --> 11:08.792
...the bank Will have no choice
but to foreclose on the property.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.085
- Foreclose?
- Foreclose?

11:11.587 --> 11:13.421
Let me ask you something.

11:13.589 --> 11:16.549
What if this camp could show
discernible means of income?

11:17.218 --> 11:18.551
Continue.

11:18.719 --> 11:21.096
We have run
the Daddy Day Care Center...

11:21.263 --> 11:23.264
...successfully
for the past several years.

11:23.432 --> 11:26.101
Allow us to use the hard-earned
trust that name brings...

11:26.268 --> 11:27.769
...to build in new clientele.

11:28.562 --> 11:30.563
I suppose I could recommend
to the bank...

11:30.731 --> 11:33.608
...that We extend the debt
for about a month.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.236
Assuming, of course'
that you can maintain the camp...

11:36.404 --> 11:38.697
...and a client base
of at least 30 children.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.616
We'll have it in tiptop shape
in no time.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.963
Yeah, you got a methane problem,
all right.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.298
Gonna have to have
that baby pumped.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.633
Oh, crap.

11:58.801 --> 12:01.803
Yeah, you said it. Gonna need
a Whole new septic tank...

12:01.971 --> 12:05.473
...new plumbing, the works.
Cost you about 14.

12:05.641 --> 12:07.642
- Hundred?
- Thousand.

12:07.977 --> 12:11.563
You know what?
We'll buy the kids gas masks.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.482
It's your party, pally,
but that methane is dangerous.

12:14.650 --> 12:17.277
You boys best be careful.

12:20.823 --> 12:24.993
- Phil.
- What? That Wasn't me.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.897
Okay, here's your lunch, sweetie.

13:36.065 --> 13:39.067
It's a sugar-free, Wheat-free,
gluten-free, tofu nugget.

13:39.235 --> 13:43.530
You have your Sidekick With text'
GPS locator in case you get lost...

13:43.697 --> 13:46.115
...and waterproof sunscreen,
in case it gets sunny...

13:46.283 --> 13:49.244
- ...while it's still raining.
- Mother, it's day camp.

13:49.411 --> 13:51.412
I'll be seven miles away.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.706
And home before dinner.

13:53.874 --> 13:55.416
Did you take your Xanax?

13:57.211 --> 13:58.920
I don't wanna go to
camp in the rain.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.256
I wanna stay home
watching nudie flicks.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.425
The brochure said there would
be sun. Please behave yourself.

14:04.593 --> 14:07.595
And for the love of God,
try not to make anyone bleed.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.265
Take your Dramamine now
before you get on the bus...

14:10.432 --> 14:12.433
...then later if you ride a horse...

14:12.601 --> 14:14.936
...or anything that bounces
or gently sways.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.189
- What about my Pepto?
- Save that for lunch.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.942
And your Beano'
in case you have a snack.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.756
It's another beautiful
woodchuck day.

14:48.304 --> 14:52.140
Promise you'll put those games away
and try to be social this summer.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.809
Die, alien scum, die.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.397
Carl, please don't let the
other kids tease your brother.

14:59.857 --> 15:01.649
What am I? Dr. Phil?

15:01.817 --> 15:04.986
I've got nothing to work with here.

15:05.487 --> 15:07.488
Archibald Lawrence Mapleton?

15:07.656 --> 15:12.327
Call me, Mullet. Business up front,
party in the back, baby.

15:12.494 --> 15:14.329
Juliette Stone?

15:14.496 --> 15:16.664
Present.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.835
Holy Hogwarts.

15:21.503 --> 15:25.340
Watch the merchandise, dude.

15:45.194 --> 15:49.739
- I still got it, huh?
- I can't hear! My ears!

15:53.702 --> 15:58.331
Okay, this is it. Time to give them
a summer they'll never forget.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.888
They won't forget that.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.194
Nature walkers, lotion up.

16:30.239 --> 16:32.156
Okay, Robin Hoods, gather around.

16:32.366 --> 16:33.992
Everybody take a bow.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.660
There you go.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.829
There's enough for everyone.
There you go.

16:55.097 --> 16:58.099
Hey, Romeo.
If you like her, go in that group.

16:58.267 --> 17:02.103
No. That's okay.
I've only got to kill one more Orc.

17:02.271 --> 17:06.023
Right. Kill your Orc, you dork.

17:06.191 --> 17:09.234
Dad, I want to be
in the group With Max.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.405
I'm older than these babies.
I should be in that group.

17:12.573 --> 17:15.116
I didn't sign up to
be with no skirts.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.576
They got cooties.

17:16.743 --> 17:18.286
There's no such thing as cooties.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.414
It's simply a term used to express
age-appropriate discomfort...

17:21.582 --> 17:23.458
...of those not of our gender.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.054
Stop arguing.

17:40.976 --> 17:43.269
You wanted to accommodate children
of all ages.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.438
Well, at this point,
we can't be too picky.

17:51.945 --> 17:55.782
Look, here we have grass.
Some grass and a big rock.

17:55.949 --> 17:57.617
How many more to go?

17:57.785 --> 18:01.287
Everybody gather round. Get in here.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.957
Can anyone tell me
what kind of tree this is?

18:05.918 --> 18:07.126
An oak?

18:07.294 --> 18:09.962
Yeah. Sure. Okay.

18:10.130 --> 18:13.466
Look over here, some berries'
maybe a strawberry thing.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.968
I wouldn't eat them, though.
Watch out.

18:16.136 --> 18:20.306
Poison ivy. Keep moving, slowly,
behind the bush.

18:20.474 --> 18:22.642
Come on, slowly. Don't touch it.

18:22.810 --> 18:25.478
Careful, careful. Okay.

18:26.480 --> 18:29.482
That would be a leaf.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.652
Ready. Aim.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.113
Wait. There's a bunny.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.323
We can't shoot with a bunny
in the field.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.659
He's way oft to the side.
You'll never hit it.

18:39.827 --> 18:42.495
Yes, we can. That's good eating.

18:42.663 --> 18:43.955
No, it's not.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.960
Wait. All right, kids, hang on.
Back up.

18:51.004 --> 18:53.005
So the rebel Borg rogue vessel...

18:53.173 --> 18:55.675
...circles around Barkon IV...

18:55.843 --> 18:58.636
...loops over the Enterprise
and doubles back...

18:58.804 --> 19:00.721
...through the space nebula.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.689
We passed this tree twice already.

19:09.857 --> 19:13.901
Because it's a very important tree
and I wanted to emphasize it.

19:14.069 --> 19:15.528
We're not lost.

19:15.696 --> 19:20.074
- Alligator.
- Calm down. Stop. Calm down.

19:20.242 --> 19:23.035
Stop.

19:23.203 --> 19:26.080
We don't have alligators
on the nature hike.

19:26.248 --> 19:27.915
It's not that good a camp.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.752
See, kids?
Everything's gonna be just fine.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.004
Air varmint.

19:44.224 --> 19:47.018
I appreciate that you kids
are such quick learners...

19:47.186 --> 19:51.439
...but these knots are not supposed
to be used for evil.

19:51.607 --> 19:55.818
See? Just a big, dumb empty log.

19:57.446 --> 20:00.239
Bees. Scatter.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.088
Now put two thumbs up.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.799
You guys, two, three'
or four of you are out...

20:18.967 --> 20:21.093
...because I didn't
say, "Simon says."

20:21.261 --> 20:23.095
All right, Simon Says.

20:23.555 --> 20:26.599
Ben. Hey, Ben.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.645
Simon says, "Wave at Daddy."

20:33.148 --> 20:36.067
Good concentration, son.
You know, because I'm not Simon.

20:37.110 --> 20:39.111
Good job, Dale.

20:48.080 --> 20:51.582
Oh, no, so many are out right now,
I can't even count how many.

20:56.672 --> 20:59.632
- Can I help you?
- Felix.

21:00.842 --> 21:04.804
Simon Says. A classic.

21:07.432 --> 21:08.975
I was showing the kids here...

21:09.142 --> 21:10.893
...where the go-cart
track will be...

21:11.061 --> 21:14.188
...once you and your team of idiots
run your camp into the ground.

21:15.315 --> 21:17.692
First of all, it's not for sale.

21:17.859 --> 21:20.653
Yeah, well, from What I heard,
that may not be up to you.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.156
Yeah, a little something
called foreclosure.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.450
Axe coming down.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.662
See all those kids
running around down there?

21:30.789 --> 21:32.707
Does that look like
a business in trouble?

21:32.874 --> 21:34.959
It's only day one, buddy boy.

21:35.127 --> 21:39.171
Once all those kids see how much fun
we're having at Camp Canola...

21:39.339 --> 21:42.383
...they'll be jumping ship
like harbour rats.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.889
And to make matters worse...

21:49.057 --> 21:53.227
...you will never be able
to beat the Chief in the Olympiad.

21:53.395 --> 21:55.646
That's him. He's the Chief.

21:55.814 --> 21:57.732
And you poop in your shorts.

21:57.899 --> 22:00.401
Nice son you got there, Lance.

22:00.569 --> 22:02.987
He ain't my kid. I hate kids.

22:05.866 --> 22:09.493
First of all, there ain't gonna be
any Olympiad. And secondly...

22:09.661 --> 22:12.580
...I care about building these
kids up, not tearing them down...

22:12.748 --> 22:14.749
...with some futile attempt
at competition.

22:15.542 --> 22:17.043
That's pathetic.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.754
You won't last a month.

22:19.921 --> 22:23.591
Yeah. Thirty-one days. Or 30.

22:23.759 --> 22:26.260
Except for February,
which stands alone.

22:28.013 --> 22:30.056
All right, let's go.

22:33.226 --> 22:35.728
Dang, he looks familiar.

22:38.148 --> 22:40.316
All right, Camp Canola.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.360
Let's head out.

22:51.244 --> 22:53.537
Wait. Oh, good Lord.

22:55.749 --> 22:59.085
Watch and learn.

23:03.799 --> 23:07.301
- Mullet. Come on.
- Hurry up.

23:07.469 --> 23:10.054
I want candy.

23:33.954 --> 23:37.957
Dale, make sure
you count them twice.

23:38.125 --> 23:41.544
Everybody on the...
Hey, no fighting.

23:42.921 --> 23:45.589
On the bus. Get on the bus.

23:49.177 --> 23:52.304
Oh, thank God.

23:52.472 --> 23:57.476
See? This is exactly
where I thought we'd come out.

23:57.811 --> 24:00.980
Get down to the bus.
It'll be leaving any second.

24:01.148 --> 24:03.149
I've gotta drop the kids oft
at the pool.

24:03.316 --> 24:04.358
We have a pool?

24:04.943 --> 24:06.652
No.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.866
This is the worst camp ever.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.327
Thanks for coming.

24:17.873 --> 24:20.040
No, no, Max.
All right, no, Max, Max.

24:21.168 --> 24:25.171
Okay, off the bus.
Everybody off the bus.

24:25.714 --> 24:29.383
Yes, off the bus. Okay. Okay. Relax.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.803
What's wrong with him?

24:32.971 --> 24:36.223
He was born with no sense of smell.

24:37.726 --> 24:38.976
What's his problem?

24:39.144 --> 24:41.896
- Mayhoffer's gonna blow.
- What?

24:57.037 --> 25:00.039
Phil, we got a situation here.
I need help.

25:00.207 --> 25:03.876
I need backup.
I repeat, backup for...

25:09.257 --> 25:11.550
All right.

25:18.767 --> 25:21.894
Code blue. Code blue, Phil.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.692
- What else could go wrong?
- No, please...

25:46.253 --> 25:48.754
I think We're gonna need
more toilet paper.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.763
Baby...

25:57.931 --> 26:01.600
...it's just not your
area of expertise.

26:01.768 --> 26:04.228
You need someone
with more outdoor experience.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.605
Someone like your father.

26:06.773 --> 26:07.982
You're gonna call Grandpa?

26:08.149 --> 26:11.485
No. Mommy's just making a joke.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.153
I don't need Buck.

26:13.321 --> 26:16.782
Kids all over town are bathing
in tomato juice, thanks to you.

26:16.950 --> 26:20.119
It was one lousy skunk
and a harmless methane explosion.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.787
Your father's a military man.

26:21.955 --> 26:25.124
You told me yourself Buck knows
everything about the outdoors.

26:25.292 --> 26:28.002
Roughing it, managing troops,
survival skills.

26:28.169 --> 26:31.505
Yeah, and he realizes it through
anger, shaming, and criticism.

26:31.673 --> 26:33.632
Here, baby, sponge yourself.

26:33.800 --> 26:37.595
Look, I know that you two have had
your problems.

26:37.762 --> 26:39.138
Problems? No.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.433
Nothing I ever did was good enough,
including sports, school, work.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.143
But other than that?

26:44.519 --> 26:47.187
He could help' and Ben would
be thrilled to see him.

26:47.355 --> 26:49.690
I think it's time you
give him a chance.

26:49.858 --> 26:53.819
Look, baby, this is my thing, okay?
I'll handle it.

26:53.987 --> 26:57.156
Phil and I got special
camp consultants coming tomorrow.

26:57.324 --> 26:59.533
It's a fresh start and a new day.

26:59.701 --> 27:01.368
Consultants?

27:01.536 --> 27:02.661
Yes.

27:02.829 --> 27:07.333
- It's all right here in our Idea Binders.
- That's for you.

27:07.500 --> 27:10.169
You just trust us.

27:10.337 --> 27:13.339
- Syl. Come to me.
- I'm right here.

27:13.506 --> 27:15.174
Be with me, think with me.

27:15.342 --> 27:17.718
We could have
this entire area carpeted.

27:17.886 --> 27:19.553
Shag carpet.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.847
Like a child, a universe grows.

27:28.188 --> 27:29.730
That was a Waste of time.

27:29.898 --> 27:33.025
Hey, don't worry. When those
35 kids get off that bus...

27:33.193 --> 27:36.362
...we're gonna show them adventure,
Charlie and Phil style.

27:48.375 --> 27:52.836
Okay. See, Phil, it's all we needed.
A new day, fresh start.

27:55.006 --> 27:56.757
Way to go, Dad.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.093
What?

28:03.723 --> 28:07.267
That's all we got. The other parents
are demanding a full refund.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.063
Let's go this way, guys.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.322
We only got seven kids left, Phil.

28:20.490 --> 28:22.408
There's no other Way
to cover these bills.

28:22.575 --> 28:24.326
We can't afford to
hire consultants...

28:24.494 --> 28:26.412
...much less make
the foreclosure payment.

28:26.579 --> 28:30.582
We can't even afford to give refunds.
That money went back into repairs.

28:30.750 --> 28:32.918
You're gonna have
to swallow your pride...

28:33.086 --> 28:35.421
...and get a man in here
to help run this camp.

28:40.051 --> 28:43.554
Historically'
the art of using troops is this:

28:43.722 --> 28:47.057
When ten to the enemy's one'
surround them with tanks.

28:47.225 --> 28:50.394
At five times the strength,
you attack With air strikes.

28:50.562 --> 28:54.231
Napoleon: All manoeuvres were
on horseback.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.568
Saladin: Camels...

28:58.903 --> 29:01.071
Colonel here.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.241
Just a sec.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.035
Civilians, you're dismissed.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.629
That's better. How can I help you?

29:17.797 --> 29:20.424
No, no. No, the time is fine.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.514
You don't say?

29:27.682 --> 29:31.185
And that's how you treat
an acute poison ivy breakout.

29:32.604 --> 29:35.522
I'd like to apologise to you guys
for letting you play...

29:35.690 --> 29:37.441
...in what I thought was clover.

29:37.609 --> 29:41.320
Jack, I wouldn't go number two
for a few weeks if I were you.

29:41.488 --> 29:44.031
I think you used that "clover"
for toilet paper.

29:45.700 --> 29:47.701
If you'd all sign these waivers...

29:47.869 --> 29:50.204
...acknowledging you've been briefed
on safety...

29:50.371 --> 29:53.123
- Here you go. Okay.
- Excuse me.

29:53.291 --> 29:55.292
With the exception
of emancipated minors...

29:55.460 --> 29:57.795
...I don't believe
that a personal injury waiver...

29:57.962 --> 30:01.298
...with confidentiality clause'
executed by a child...

30:01.466 --> 30:03.884
...is a legally binding document'
Uncle Phil.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.304
It's a raid.

30:09.682 --> 30:11.642
Camp Canola!

30:29.828 --> 30:32.037
Get the flag.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.271
I can use the second mortgage
on the house...

30:57.438 --> 30:59.898
...to pay off the
bills for the camp?

31:00.066 --> 31:03.569
Great. No, Mr. Thumson,
I don't need you to come out here.

31:03.736 --> 31:06.405
No, business is fine. It's just...

31:06.573 --> 31:08.740
You know,
we have such a full house.

31:14.914 --> 31:16.915
Can I call you back?

31:24.257 --> 31:26.133
What the heck is going on here?

31:46.237 --> 31:48.614
Open your ear-holes, dweebers.

31:48.781 --> 31:53.285
"We, the mighty troops of Fort
Canola, have braved hill and dale...

31:53.453 --> 31:55.454
...so that we may find...

31:55.622 --> 31:59.333
...who are the greatest warriors
in the land."

32:01.628 --> 32:04.755
No. No. No way.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.673
You are Way out of line, Lance.

32:06.841 --> 32:08.467
Behold!

32:11.304 --> 32:13.472
This spear of honour...

32:13.640 --> 32:17.976
...garnished with
the flame of truth.

32:19.562 --> 32:21.730
Now, I challenge ye...

32:21.898 --> 32:26.860
...to the XLV Annual
Intercamp Olympiad.

32:28.863 --> 32:32.032
That's the 37th Olympiad to you,
pea brain.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.492
Forty-fifth.

32:33.660 --> 32:37.037
I told you before, there isn't going
to be any competition.

32:38.665 --> 32:42.376
Well, then let the
onslaught continue.

33:07.568 --> 33:11.905
Now's your chance.
Go say something.

33:15.910 --> 33:18.245
Do you like World of Warcraft?

33:18.413 --> 33:19.579
World of what?

33:21.082 --> 33:23.917
I'm a Level 40 Blood Elf Druid.

33:24.085 --> 33:27.087
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

33:29.590 --> 33:30.924
Goodbye.

33:31.092 --> 33:34.594
I like causing destruction'
not cleaning up after it.

33:34.762 --> 33:38.432
Is that why you threw a paint grenade
at your own campmate during a raid?

33:38.599 --> 33:42.602
What can I say?
War is hell, skunk-boy.

33:43.730 --> 33:50.235
Fight. Fight. Fight.

33:50.403 --> 33:53.697
Cut it out. Stop it. Stop fighting.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.117
A ten-hut.

34:00.788 --> 34:03.707
I see this unit's
morale is flagging.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.543
There is only one solution for that.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.795
All of those who are my grandson'
front and centre.

34:09.964 --> 34:12.632
- Come here, you little peanut.
- Grandpa Buck.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.303
Do you remember this manoeuvre?

34:16.471 --> 34:18.138
Sneak attack at tickle point.

34:23.603 --> 34:27.272
Everyone, this is my father,
Colonel Buck Hinton.

34:27.440 --> 34:30.650
- Reporting for duty, corporal.
- Please don't call me that.

34:32.445 --> 34:34.987
All right, then, private.

34:36.783 --> 34:40.786
Gentlemen. Ladies.
What I just witnessed was a mutiny.

34:40.953 --> 34:43.163
Among campers'
that is unacceptable...

34:43.331 --> 34:45.956
...from this point forward.

34:46.667 --> 34:47.708
Now...

34:47.877 --> 34:49.960
...front and centre. Double time.

34:50.129 --> 34:53.297
I'll make you soldiers
if it's the last thing I do.

34:53.466 --> 34:57.302
No, wait a minute. There is no
mutiny. Everything is under control.

34:57.470 --> 34:58.804
This is not why I called you.

34:59.972 --> 35:04.309
- Why the misconduct, soldier?
- We got raided by Camp Canola.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.646
- Yeah.
- Sneak attack, huh?

35:07.814 --> 35:09.231
Well, I'm sorry, private.

35:09.398 --> 35:11.149
We should be planning
a counterattack.

35:11.317 --> 35:14.653
Meet force With force.
I say we hit them at nightfall.

35:14.821 --> 35:17.697
- Yeah.
- No. No.

35:17.865 --> 35:20.492
Driftwood Day Camp.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.994
Hit them at 5,
when the sun's in their eyes.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.663
Yeah.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.623
Okay, guys.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.668
Guys, can you excuse us
for a minute?

35:33.005 --> 35:35.132
This is not a boot camp. All right?

35:35.299 --> 35:38.009
We're not looking for Colonel
Hinton' war games consultant.

35:38.177 --> 35:41.012
We're looking for Colonel Hinton'
experienced team builder...

35:41.180 --> 35:43.682
...slash King of the Outdoors.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.393
We're not trying to turn these kids
into Marines.

35:49.063 --> 35:50.730
What's wrong with being a Marine?

35:52.316 --> 35:54.359
Maybe if you had enlisted...

35:54.527 --> 35:58.738
...you could work yourself out of a jam
instead of calling in reinforcements.

35:58.906 --> 36:01.408
Listen. Yes, I do appreciate
your coming.

36:01.576 --> 36:03.034
Yes, we do need your help.

36:03.202 --> 36:06.830
But We don't want to get into
this thing with Camp Canola.

36:07.874 --> 36:10.083
- No war games?
- No.

36:10.251 --> 36:11.585
Hand-to-hand combat?

36:14.547 --> 36:16.756
- Guerrilla warfare?
- No war.

36:16.924 --> 36:18.049
No war.

36:18.217 --> 36:20.886
Just help us run Driftwood,
all right?

36:21.053 --> 36:22.721
Can you follow those orders, Dad?

36:24.390 --> 36:27.100
That's colonel to you, private.

36:29.562 --> 36:30.937
Line up.

36:59.091 --> 37:01.927
In through the nose.

37:02.094 --> 37:05.096
Out through the mouth.

37:05.973 --> 37:09.434
In through the nose.

37:11.646 --> 37:14.981
Out through the mouth.

37:15.775 --> 37:18.068
The samurai warrior meditates...

37:18.236 --> 37:23.615
...to blend mind
and body into harmony.

37:31.457 --> 37:33.416
Come here. Come to me.

37:33.584 --> 37:36.711
Hey! Hey!

37:37.463 --> 37:41.341
Hey, old man, what's with the séance
in the middle of our off-road track?

37:41.509 --> 37:44.469
What? Get them out of here!

37:44.637 --> 37:47.472
Get your kids out of here!
Get them out of here!

37:47.640 --> 37:49.975
Somebody's gonna get hurt!

37:53.145 --> 37:55.689
Relax, General Depends.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.192
Shouldn't you be
in some bingo game or something?

37:59.360 --> 38:02.862
L-27. G-13.

38:03.030 --> 38:05.657
All right, boys.
Let's move them out.

38:05.825 --> 38:10.370
- B-7.
- G-40.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.539
That tears it.

38:13.332 --> 38:16.001
Rules of engagement...

38:17.003 --> 38:19.546
...been overruled.

38:28.514 --> 38:32.851
There's the objective.
Anyone unclear on their role?

38:33.019 --> 38:34.352
No, sir.

38:34.520 --> 38:37.689
- Anyone wanna go home?
- No, sir.

38:37.857 --> 38:42.193
Operation MoonPie is a go.

38:48.909 --> 38:50.952
It's right up here.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.456
You know, I've never been up here.

39:10.890 --> 39:14.851
Help. Help. Come on, y'all.
Give me a lift. Come on, please.

39:17.897 --> 39:19.898
Go, go.

39:30.910 --> 39:34.954
Where is it? Where is it?
I know that loser from somewhere.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.583
Where is it?

39:43.089 --> 39:45.090
Jackpot.

39:48.260 --> 39:50.929
Charlie Hinton.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.727
Can I help you?

39:57.895 --> 40:00.271
- Hi, my name's Becca.
- I'm Juliette.

40:00.439 --> 40:01.981
And we've come to offer you...

40:02.149 --> 40:04.150
...the Driftwood
Olive Branch of Peace.

40:04.318 --> 40:05.985
In exchange for our friendship...

40:06.153 --> 40:08.446
...all we ask is
that you return our flag.

40:11.617 --> 40:14.285
Did big bad Charlie send
his little bitty girls...

40:14.453 --> 40:17.080
...to do his bidding for him, huh?

40:17.248 --> 40:19.958
Let's put it this way:
Either you give it back...

40:20.126 --> 40:22.335
...or we take it.

40:22.503 --> 40:25.171
You and what army, Petunia?

40:25.798 --> 40:27.173
You had to ask.

40:31.804 --> 40:33.972
Ask What?

40:40.187 --> 40:41.563
What the...?

40:49.864 --> 40:50.905
Get him.

40:51.115 --> 40:54.033
You're messing With Lance Warner.

41:01.667 --> 41:03.668
Stuck.

41:15.389 --> 41:16.473
Yes.

41:18.392 --> 41:19.893
Hey, Warner.

41:26.066 --> 41:28.318
- Yes.
- That's my boy.

41:28.486 --> 41:30.904
Sound the alarm. Red alert.

41:31.071 --> 41:34.574
We're under attack.
This is not a drill, people.

41:34.742 --> 41:38.703
Everyone to your stations!
Security's been breached!

41:38.871 --> 41:41.247
The perimeter's
been compromised!

41:41.415 --> 41:43.583
Lock the gates! Call my dad!

41:48.047 --> 41:50.256
Hey, Dale, you seen Buck?

41:50.424 --> 41:52.550
Supposed to be back
with the kids an hour ago.

41:52.718 --> 41:54.219
I wouldn't sweat it.

41:54.386 --> 41:58.723
Your dad's like
the most responsible guy I ever met.

41:59.391 --> 42:02.101
Yeah, you're probably right.

42:05.731 --> 42:08.733
Get back here, you little rodents.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.193
Come on. Come on.

42:10.361 --> 42:15.114
No! No, no, no.
Give me my pants back.

42:15.282 --> 42:16.449
Here's your diaper.

42:17.910 --> 42:20.078
Clean yourself off.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.373
Move out.

42:26.085 --> 42:30.755
Let go. Get back here, you cowards.

42:30.923 --> 42:34.092
No one messes With Lance Warner,
you hear me?

42:34.260 --> 42:36.594
No one.

42:58.659 --> 43:00.577
G. I. Joe is turning red.

43:00.744 --> 43:02.662
Someone farted on his head.

43:02.830 --> 43:04.789
G. I. Joe is turning pink.

43:04.957 --> 43:06.791
Someone puked in the kitchen sink.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.751
G. I. Joe is turning white.

43:09.211 --> 43:11.129
The zippers on his pants
are really tight.

43:11.297 --> 43:13.131
G.I. Joe is turning blue.

43:13.299 --> 43:15.300
There are peanuts in his poo.

43:15.467 --> 43:17.677
Company, halt.

43:17.845 --> 43:19.178
Where have you guys been?

43:19.346 --> 43:21.889
Your nature hike was supposed
to be back an hour ago.

43:22.516 --> 43:24.350
Present colours.

43:30.858 --> 43:32.775
- You didn't?
- Yes, sir.

43:33.611 --> 43:35.320
Robert, what happened
to your head?

43:35.487 --> 43:38.114
It's just a battle wound.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.701
Dale, go get the first-aid kit.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.787
You take these kids off our premises
without permission slips...

43:44.955 --> 43:46.497
...and bring them back like this?

43:46.874 --> 43:48.207
Affirmative.

43:48.375 --> 43:50.960
See, this is exactly the thing
I was afraid of.

43:51.170 --> 43:54.547
We restored our honour, Dad.
It was just...

43:57.843 --> 44:02.513
What kind of insane militant
nut factory you running here, huh?

44:02.681 --> 44:06.559
Huh, Charlie Hinton?
Driftwood Class of '77.

44:06.727 --> 44:09.062
- That's right, I know who you are.
- Listen, Lance.

44:09.229 --> 44:11.064
I'm really sorry about this.
In fact...

44:11.231 --> 44:14.233
...my father and I were just about
to have a discussion about it.

44:14.401 --> 44:16.861
This is your father?

44:17.696 --> 44:20.782
Oh, this is classic. Oh, sure.

44:20.949 --> 44:23.076
The chicken's come home
to roost, huh?

44:23.243 --> 44:26.329
Now I know why you don't want
to compete in the Olympiad.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.748
You're afraid of getting
your butt kicked again...

44:28.916 --> 44:30.708
...in front of
Lieutenant Prune Juice.

44:30.876 --> 44:32.001
Colonel.

44:32.169 --> 44:34.337
Oh, Colonel. Sorry.

44:34.505 --> 44:38.383
Look, Lance, I'm just trying to teach
these kids about sportsmanship.

44:38.550 --> 44:42.929
No, the only thing you can teach
these kids is how to lose.

44:43.889 --> 44:45.348
Or have you forgotten?

44:45.641 --> 44:49.560
"Daddy. Look at me.

44:58.570 --> 45:01.114
I'm a failure."

45:05.869 --> 45:09.288
You know why my parents bought
Camp Canola for me?

45:09.456 --> 45:10.748
No, why?

45:10.916 --> 45:13.918
Because that summer
when I kicked your butt...

45:15.254 --> 45:17.630
...that was the best moment
of my life.

45:17.798 --> 45:21.092
And now, every day when I wake up,
I get to live that dream.

45:21.260 --> 45:23.636
And it is fantastic.

45:23.804 --> 45:25.972
Peaked when you were 11,
did you, Lance?

45:26.140 --> 45:28.433
See, I get it, Charlie.

45:28.600 --> 45:32.145
You don't want your kid
to end up a loser like you.

45:33.647 --> 45:35.815
Like father, like son.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.821
Oh, sure. No, that's cool.
You walk away.

45:41.989 --> 45:44.157
Yeah, because refusing to compete...

45:44.324 --> 45:45.950
...just proves to the community...

45:46.118 --> 45:48.161
...which camp they should send
their kids to.

45:48.328 --> 45:50.621
Mine.

45:51.123 --> 45:52.915
Adiós.

45:58.756 --> 46:01.424
What I'd really like to do
is kick your butt.

46:02.134 --> 46:05.636
Being as we're trying to set
a good example here, mister...

46:05.804 --> 46:08.014
...you got yourself an Olympiad.

46:08.182 --> 46:09.974
Yeah!

46:10.809 --> 46:13.352
Fantastic.

46:19.318 --> 46:20.777
Yeah.

46:21.862 --> 46:23.654
Good, good job.

46:23.822 --> 46:25.406
The great Julius Caesar
once said...

46:25.574 --> 46:28.701
You were way out of line
with what you did today.

46:28.869 --> 46:31.537
If we do this, we do it my Way.
You got it?

46:33.332 --> 46:36.334
- Affirmative.
- Good.

46:36.502 --> 46:40.046
Now. What do you think
we should do?

46:43.008 --> 46:45.343
A sleepover?

46:45.511 --> 46:47.512
I thought the Whole purpose
of day camp...

46:47.679 --> 46:50.348
...was sending the kids home
at the end of the day.

46:50.516 --> 46:52.892
It was your idea to get
my father involved.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.520
According to Buck,
the best way to build team unity...

46:55.687 --> 46:59.190
...is to put the kids in a new situation
where they have to work together...

46:59.358 --> 47:00.566
...to overcome stuff.

47:00.734 --> 47:05.029
Well, I think someone wants
to impress his own father.

47:05.697 --> 47:09.242
Listen, this Olympiad is gonna
be good for business.

47:09.409 --> 47:12.370
Once those Canola parents see
how Well our kids work together...

47:12.538 --> 47:14.247
...we might drum up new customers.

47:14.414 --> 47:16.874
If you think parents
are gonna switch camps...

47:17.042 --> 47:20.211
...based off of who Wins
some silly events...

47:20.879 --> 47:25.383
Mrs. Hinton?
I'm Edward Thumson from the bank.

47:27.553 --> 47:32.431
Yes, I'm aware of who you are'
but what are you doing in my house?

47:32.599 --> 47:35.059
Is that real Tiffany crystal?

47:36.061 --> 47:37.603
It is standard procedure to do...

47:37.771 --> 47:39.939
...a pre-inventory
prior to the foreclosure.

47:40.107 --> 47:42.942
But the first installment is not due
until next week.

47:43.110 --> 47:45.069
True. But with only six campers...

47:45.279 --> 47:51.242
- ...it is mathematically impossible for...
- Actually, there's seven campers.

47:51.410 --> 47:55.413
- What's going on?
- Oh, I'll tell you what's going on.

47:55.581 --> 47:57.582
We overextended ourselves
with the camp.

47:57.749 --> 47:59.792
Now strange men are touching
the furniture...

47:59.960 --> 48:01.502
...messing With my mama's vase...

48:01.670 --> 48:04.130
...Mr. Thumson's threatening
to take my house away.

48:04.298 --> 48:06.549
Okay, okay.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.759
- I know what I gotta do.
- What?

48:08.927 --> 48:11.095
- I'll sell the camp.
- Listen to me.

48:11.263 --> 48:13.139
If you believe by winning
this Olympiad...

48:13.307 --> 48:15.099
...more kids will
come to the camp...

48:15.267 --> 48:17.894
...then you go kick
some Lance Warner butt.

49:26.463 --> 49:29.507
Come on. Come on, soldier.

49:37.516 --> 49:38.849
Yes.

49:40.310 --> 49:41.852
Ben! Hey!

50:21.893 --> 50:24.895
Come on, son.

50:25.063 --> 50:27.064
- I know the song.
- Well, what?

50:27.232 --> 50:29.734
You don't like being
in the support vehicle with me...

50:29.901 --> 50:33.195
...instead of out there with poison
ivy, rocks and whatnot? Bugs.

50:33.363 --> 50:38.409
It's supposed to be a hike.
I look like a goober.

50:38.577 --> 50:42.413
Okay. You're right.

50:45.751 --> 50:47.043
Oh, look at her.

50:48.253 --> 50:51.630
She even puts on bug spray
like an angel.

50:51.798 --> 50:55.259
You're pathetic. Go walk With her.
Get your groove on, dude.

50:55.427 --> 50:57.762
What makes you such an expert?
You're only 6.

50:57.929 --> 51:01.766
I know I won't spend
my best years buried in video games.

51:01.933 --> 51:04.310
Shut up. Don't make...

51:08.815 --> 51:10.399
Here, buddy.

51:11.651 --> 51:14.820
Stop it. Stop it.

51:16.031 --> 51:20.034
Hey, Billy? What's going on?

51:20.202 --> 51:21.702
Nothing.

51:21.870 --> 51:24.371
No wet willies to dish out?

51:24.539 --> 51:26.957
Maybe you could switch over
to the purple nurple.

51:27.125 --> 51:29.919
No, I already gave one to Mayhoffer.

51:30.087 --> 51:34.423
It's just... I don't like
sleepovers. That's all.

51:34.591 --> 51:36.258
And why is that?

51:38.136 --> 51:42.348
Come on, Billy, you can always trust
a fat guy. I won't tell anybody.

51:42.516 --> 51:45.476
Cross my heart, hope to diet.

51:46.520 --> 51:49.688
- I sometimes wet the bed.
- What?

51:50.690 --> 51:52.608
I sometimes wet the bed.

51:55.403 --> 51:57.696
You know what?

51:57.864 --> 52:00.241
I had the same problem
till I was darn near 10.

52:00.408 --> 52:03.536
Really? What did you do
at sleepovers?

52:03.703 --> 52:06.080
An excellent question,
my young friend.

52:06.248 --> 52:08.249
I think you'll be intrigued
by the answer.

52:15.090 --> 52:17.091
Get that equipment up, Brown.

52:17.259 --> 52:19.218
This is dumb.
Why We gotta walk so far?

52:19.386 --> 52:21.637
Far? Halt.

52:21.805 --> 52:24.014
Now you listen up, hippie-hair.

52:24.182 --> 52:26.392
How are you gonna compete
against Camp Canola...

52:26.560 --> 52:28.727
...tomorrow morning
with that kind of attitude?

52:29.896 --> 52:33.482
We have 12 events staring at us
dead in the eye.

52:33.650 --> 52:35.734
We have got to toughen up.

52:35.902 --> 52:39.738
When I was your age, I used to march
six miles into the woods...

52:39.906 --> 52:43.826
...just to spend the night alone
in a tree. Focus on a goal.

52:46.413 --> 52:48.747
I used to put rocks
in my backpack...

52:48.915 --> 52:51.083
...just to get stronger.

52:51.251 --> 52:54.920
That's how you grow up to be a man.
Ain't that right, Ben?

52:55.088 --> 52:57.423
All right. Let's head out.

52:57.591 --> 52:59.925
Forward, march.

53:07.767 --> 53:09.768
Hey, Ben.
What are you doing there, son?

53:09.936 --> 53:11.604
Nothing.

53:21.781 --> 53:26.285
I'm so full.

53:28.288 --> 53:30.623
I'm fuller than you.

53:32.626 --> 53:35.127
No one's as full as me.

53:37.631 --> 53:41.300
But now I've got room for dessert.
Who wants s'mores?

53:44.971 --> 53:46.597
Anything I can help you with?

53:47.641 --> 53:49.975
Can't find the chocolate
or the marshmallows.

53:50.143 --> 53:52.978
What are you talking about?
They're in my bag.

53:55.649 --> 53:57.942
Who wants chocolate?

54:00.320 --> 54:02.655
What are we gonna roast?

54:18.755 --> 54:22.258
Nice job, Hinton.
Your dad is such a schwing.

54:22.425 --> 54:24.677
I gotta roast something
with a pit in it.

54:24.844 --> 54:27.846
Shut up. I don't like it
any more than you do.

54:28.014 --> 54:29.306
It's not my fault.

54:32.727 --> 54:34.520
Dude, trust me.

54:34.688 --> 54:38.857
A star-filled sky,
the warm glow of a fire...

54:39.025 --> 54:42.027
She'll be like Silly Putty
in your hands.

54:42.195 --> 54:45.030
What makes you such an expert?

54:45.198 --> 54:48.033
Look, you know how grownups
are always saying...

54:48.201 --> 54:50.369
...they wish they knew then
what they know now?

54:50.537 --> 54:53.789
- Yeah.
- Well, I know.

54:53.957 --> 54:57.376
How are we ever gonna beat Canola
with runts like you on our team?

54:57.544 --> 55:02.965
Yeah. What you gonna do, tiny?
Bang your pan until they surrender?

55:09.055 --> 55:11.974
I think I burned my banana.

55:19.065 --> 55:21.066
- Hello.
- Hey.

55:22.068 --> 55:24.320
How are you doing
this fine evening?

55:24.487 --> 55:27.990
Pretty good. Never roasted
a pear before, but it smells good.

55:28.158 --> 55:32.244
Yes, smells are good'
and you, too, smell, Juliette.

55:32.412 --> 55:34.830
I mean, things smell...

55:34.998 --> 55:38.083
I mean, good, you smell.

55:38.251 --> 55:41.879
Sorry, it must have been
from the hike, because...

55:42.047 --> 55:44.089
No, no, I mean...

55:46.092 --> 55:47.217
It's a nice night.

55:47.385 --> 55:51.263
Starry skies, a warm fire.

55:51.431 --> 55:53.432
Good food.

56:01.441 --> 56:02.816
Idiot.

56:08.573 --> 56:11.033
Great place you got there.
What's the mortgage like?

56:11.201 --> 56:12.242
What are you doing?

56:12.410 --> 56:14.411
Sleeping in a hollowed-out log
or something?

56:14.579 --> 56:16.955
It's called camping, private.
You should try it.

56:17.123 --> 56:18.999
Yes, right.

56:20.085 --> 56:24.922
Jack, I think that banana is about
as cooked as it's gonna get there.

56:25.090 --> 56:27.633
It's so slimy.

56:27.801 --> 56:30.427
No, it's roasting. It's supposed
to bring out the flavour.

56:31.304 --> 56:33.806
Try it. You'll like it, I promise.

56:37.477 --> 56:39.812
Good, right?

56:47.529 --> 56:48.987
No!

56:52.909 --> 56:54.368
I'm done with that.

56:54.994 --> 56:56.912
That's nasty.

56:57.747 --> 56:59.748
You feel better?

57:30.447 --> 57:33.115
Sure you're gonna need that, son?

57:36.619 --> 57:39.955
Good Lord's filling the sky
with a million nightlights.

57:40.707 --> 57:41.832
Just for you.

57:48.089 --> 57:51.341
Don't know why you got your panties
in a Wad tonight, Mayhoffer.

57:51.509 --> 57:54.511
We're all getting butt spackled
tomorrow anyways.

57:54.679 --> 57:56.221
What are you talking about?

57:56.389 --> 57:59.725
You don't seriously think we
can beat those rich Canola kids?

57:59.893 --> 58:01.643
Yeah, they're gonna cream us.

58:01.811 --> 58:04.229
Cream? Cream is for coffee.

58:05.857 --> 58:08.066
Okay. Listen up, troops.

58:09.861 --> 58:13.238
It's come to my attention some of you
don't believe we can win tomorrow.

58:14.240 --> 58:15.532
Okay.

58:15.700 --> 58:19.912
Maybe they have fancy equipment.
Gold-plated toilet paper.

58:20.079 --> 58:22.539
But We got something
those snotty-nosed...

58:22.707 --> 58:24.750
...silver-spoon brats
will never have.

58:24.918 --> 58:28.170
- Do you Want to know what that is?
- Lice?

58:28.338 --> 58:30.756
Driftwood spirit.

58:30.924 --> 58:32.716
I didn't think you guys had it...

58:32.884 --> 58:35.344
...but the way you pulled yourselves
together today...

58:35.512 --> 58:38.222
...made me prouder
than any platoon I've ever led.

58:40.099 --> 58:42.601
- We couldn't have done it Without you.
- Nonsense.

58:42.769 --> 58:45.562
You couldn't have done it
without this.

58:45.730 --> 58:49.441
Because it's Driftwood Camp spirit
that links us all together...

58:49.609 --> 58:51.527
...and makes it all possible.

58:52.278 --> 58:55.948
You're not just a bunch of kids
that came together in camp.

58:56.115 --> 58:59.076
You're a team. Team.

58:59.244 --> 59:02.955
- Team.
- Team.

59:03.122 --> 59:05.958
Team, team, team!

59:06.125 --> 59:07.417
And listen, team.

59:07.585 --> 59:11.296
Tomorrow, you're gonna take
those lobster-eating...

59:11.464 --> 59:12.548
Yeah!

59:12.715 --> 59:15.133
- ...those Humvee-driving...
- Yeah!

59:15.301 --> 59:18.303
...Canola cretins and you're gonna
throw them in the dumper.

59:18.471 --> 59:21.014
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

59:21.474 --> 59:24.226
Yeah!

59:24.435 --> 59:27.980
You don't think you're setting
them up for a pretty big letdown?

59:28.773 --> 59:31.316
Well, in order to win the battle...

59:31.484 --> 59:34.987
...one must first believe
in the success of the mission.

59:35.154 --> 59:38.323
It's been a long time
since you've been in battle.

59:39.325 --> 59:41.743
A minor technicality.

59:41.911 --> 59:44.830
Hey, have you guys seen Ben?
I can't find him.

59:46.499 --> 59:48.834
- Ben?
- Ben?

59:49.002 --> 59:50.502
- Ben!
- Ben?

59:52.672 --> 59:54.631
- Ben!
- Are you in there?

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:07.352
- Ben.
- Come out.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:12.858
Guys, I found him.

01:00:13.026 --> 01:00:14.359
Ben.

01:00:14.527 --> 01:00:18.697
Ben, get down from there.
What are you doing?

01:00:18.865 --> 01:00:23.160
Get down. Where you been, man?
We been looking all over for you.

01:00:23.328 --> 01:00:26.872
Listen, don't ever scare me
like that again, you hear me?

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:31.376
I'm okay. I just wanted to be
like Grandpa, that's all.

01:00:31.544 --> 01:00:34.880
So you wandered off by yourself?
You know how dangerous that is?

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:37.716
Grandpa said
it's what made him tough...

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:40.552
...so I thought it'd do
the same for me.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.387
What?

01:00:44.849 --> 01:00:47.392
All right, guys, listen up.
Listen to me.

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:50.187
Let me tell you something
about being tough, okay?

01:00:50.355 --> 01:00:52.564
Being tough doesn't necessarily
make you a hero.

01:00:52.732 --> 01:00:57.402
Sometimes tough people grow up to
be arrogant, selfish and stubborn.

01:00:57.570 --> 01:00:59.738
You guys just need to be yourselves.

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:01.740
And know that
by being yourselves...

01:01:01.908 --> 01:01:03.909
...you're gonna be Winners'
no matter what.

01:01:04.077 --> 01:01:06.161
Even if we choke like you?

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:09.373
Especially if you choke like me.

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.582
Listen.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:14.252
I want you guys to grow up
to be kind and caring...

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.922
...and accepting of people.

01:01:17.090 --> 01:01:19.883
Even if they make mistakes.

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:24.262
So, Ben,
don't try to be so tough, okay?

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:27.766
Just try to be your best.
That's all that matters.

01:01:27.934 --> 01:01:29.101
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:01:29.268 --> 01:01:30.519
Okay.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:35.190
Okay, my little Olympians,
time to rest up for the big day.

01:01:35.358 --> 01:01:37.901
- Oh, come on.
- Come on.

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:43.281
Calling Buck, man,
what Was I thinking?

01:01:43.449 --> 01:01:45.450
It's the only way he knows, Charlie.

01:01:45.618 --> 01:01:48.620
If that means him jeopardizing
any more kids, he can keep it.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:52.457
I don't want Ben to grow up
to be anything like my father.

01:01:53.793 --> 01:01:56.128
Let's go.

01:02:25.658 --> 01:02:27.159
Shoot.

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:42.007
What the heck is...?
Oh, you nasty...

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.012
This is a mistake.

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:17.209
Wait for me.

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:28.386
Yes. It worked. I'm dry.

01:03:28.554 --> 01:03:30.555
See? Told you, Billy.

01:03:30.723 --> 01:03:33.225
You always fool
the bed-wetting goblins...

01:03:33.392 --> 01:03:35.393
...if you sleep in your day clothes.

01:03:35.561 --> 01:03:37.562
Go play with the kids.

01:03:56.082 --> 01:04:01.086
Oh, my neck. I'm so cold.

01:04:01.254 --> 01:04:03.505
Feel like a human pincushion.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:07.592
- Relax, Charlie. Look around.
- Oh, thank you.

01:04:10.596 --> 01:04:12.931
Would you look at that?

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.267
They're running around'
having a good time.

01:04:15.434 --> 01:04:19.437
Oh, Buck's gonna go on and on
about how he was right...

01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:22.440
...and I'm way too overprotective.

01:04:22.608 --> 01:04:25.277
Buck's not gonna go on and on
about anything.

01:04:25.444 --> 01:04:27.946
I haven't seen him all morning.

01:04:42.795 --> 01:04:45.964
Sign up for camp, please?
Driftwood?

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:48.800
Hey, do you Wanna sign up...? No?

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:52.387
Well, as you can tell, we've
obviously destroyed their camp...

01:04:52.555 --> 01:04:53.972
...over the last couple years.

01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.809
I'm thinking, once we kick
Driftwood's butt one more time...

01:04:57.977 --> 01:05:00.103
...this is where
the new hardware goes.

01:05:00.271 --> 01:05:03.315
What do you say?
It's gonna be great.

01:05:04.233 --> 01:05:06.484
Hey, Chuck E. Cheese!

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.987
Getting a little nervous?

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:12.449
Let me give you the 411
on the day's events.

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:13.950
Okay.

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:18.163
The Olympiad starts.
Your team sucks. You lose.

01:05:18.331 --> 01:05:19.998
The end.

01:05:21.667 --> 01:05:23.919
Good luck, Lance.

01:05:25.671 --> 01:05:27.339
I don't need luck.

01:05:35.306 --> 01:05:38.016
Okay, I'll take it from here.

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:43.146
Forfeit! I forfeit!

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:48.360
- Have you seen Grandpa Buck?
- Col. Buck has been gone a long time.

01:05:48.527 --> 01:05:52.864
Guys, I'm sure he'll be here.
Okay, so just reach to the left.

01:05:53.157 --> 01:05:54.199
Stretch.

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:59.204
No news yet on Buck.
Margaret's driving all over town.

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.539
But I did find this in your office.

01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:04.376
"Charlie, Uncle Sam called
about another job...

01:06:04.543 --> 01:06:07.671
...which is just as well, seeing
as things aren't working out here.

01:06:07.838 --> 01:06:10.048
Your tough Colonel Buck."

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:12.676
- I'll keep looking.
- Okay.

01:06:12.843 --> 01:06:15.053
Is that from Grandpa?

01:06:16.555 --> 01:06:18.890
Yes. Yes, it is.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:21.851
He's not coming back?

01:06:22.019 --> 01:06:24.312
Well, no.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.190
He's the one that showed us
how to do everything.

01:06:27.358 --> 01:06:29.859
We're gonna get whupped.
I don't get whupped.

01:06:30.027 --> 01:06:31.403
I do the whupping.

01:06:31.570 --> 01:06:34.072
We're doomed. Doomed, I tell you.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:35.907
Wait, Wait, wait a minute.

01:06:36.075 --> 01:06:39.577
Just because Buck got called away
to serve his country last night...

01:06:39.745 --> 01:06:43.248
...doesn't mean we take everything he
taught us and just let it go to waste.

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:47.335
- He deserted us.
- Without so much as a "see you."

01:06:47.503 --> 01:06:51.589
No, no, no. He didn't.
It's here in the letter, listen.

01:06:51.757 --> 01:06:54.592
"Dear Ben, Max, Juliette, Robert...

01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:59.014
...Carl, Jack, Becca, Billy,
and Mullet:

01:06:59.181 --> 01:07:02.225
Sorry to leave in the night
without even saying, 'See you'...

01:07:02.393 --> 01:07:05.770
...but it's important
that you don't panic.

01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:09.107
The 103rd Airborne is staging
manoeuvres tonight...

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:13.737
...and let's just say they could learn
something about teamwork from you."

01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:17.115
The 103rd was retired
after World War II.

01:07:17.283 --> 01:07:19.534
Tell you what?
They're bringing it back.

01:07:19.702 --> 01:07:23.079
- We can't do this Without Buck.
- Yeah.

01:07:23.247 --> 01:07:26.291
Sure We can. You know what?
He would've wanted it that way.

01:07:26.459 --> 01:07:28.460
You know why?
Because we're a family.

01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:31.880
We'll pull each other up,
because that's what families do.

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:35.300
If family's so important,
why'd Grandpa Buck leave?

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.302
Yeah.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:58.490
- Going that well, huh?
- Best day of my life.

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:02.160
Well, Ben seems upset
about Buck leaving.

01:08:02.995 --> 01:08:04.329
Yeah.

01:08:05.498 --> 01:08:09.834
You know why grandkids
and grandparents get along so well?

01:08:10.002 --> 01:08:12.420
They're united by a common enemy.

01:08:13.839 --> 01:08:15.507
Makes sense.

01:08:16.675 --> 01:08:21.179
I'm saying, if you and Buck could unite
around each other's strengths...

01:08:21.346 --> 01:08:23.807
...Ben could have
the best of both worlds.

01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:29.854
Go get them, coach. For all of us.

01:08:37.363 --> 01:08:41.366
Good news.
Found this in Buck's cabin.

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:48.038
I'll Watch after the kids.
You go make things right.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.874
Thanks.

01:09:33.919 --> 01:09:36.587
You missed your train.

01:09:37.256 --> 01:09:40.258
I missed a train.

01:09:40.759 --> 01:09:43.261
Haven't really decided
which one I'm getting on yet.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.724
I thought you had
to be back for manoeuvres.

01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:51.269
That's true, but next year.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.939
That's about as often
as they let a broke-down retiree...

01:09:55.107 --> 01:09:57.275
...come out and play
with the reservists.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.405
"Retiree."

01:10:06.118 --> 01:10:08.620
About the only action
I get these days...

01:10:08.787 --> 01:10:11.623
...is when college students
are doing...

01:10:11.790 --> 01:10:14.209
...research papers
on military history.

01:10:19.298 --> 01:10:20.798
So...

01:10:20.966 --> 01:10:24.302
...you abandoned your post
this morning.

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:27.305
Good soldier knows
when he's in hostile territory.

01:10:28.432 --> 01:10:31.267
You heard me last night, didn't you?

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:35.772
I guess I've had a few things
on my mind over the last...

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:38.233
...30 years or so.

01:10:39.109 --> 01:10:41.819
I didn't even know
you felt that way.

01:10:45.282 --> 01:10:47.951
Strange, getting older.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:53.456
Easier remembering things
the way you Wish they were.

01:10:58.295 --> 01:11:00.838
I want you to know I'm proud
of the man you've become.

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:06.135
The way you make adjustments
in the field...

01:11:06.303 --> 01:11:09.806
...like opening a day care centre
when you lost your job.

01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:15.311
Me, I wouldn't be able to do that.

01:11:18.357 --> 01:11:21.025
I've always needed more structure.

01:11:25.489 --> 01:11:30.326
I'm far from perfect, believe me.
Far from it.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:38.876
I know one thing though,
those kids are gonna be crushed...

01:11:39.044 --> 01:11:42.880
...unless your leathery old butt
comes back.

01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:00.898
Do you smell gasoline?

01:12:32.389 --> 01:12:33.765
That's right.

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:44.442
Minor setback, people.
We'll get them in the next event.

01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:47.570
Wrestling?
Have you seen Max wrestle?

01:12:47.738 --> 01:12:49.739
He's right. I suck.

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:54.369
Yeah. And that Canola guy's
hairier than my grandmother's mole.

01:12:54.536 --> 01:12:55.578
We're stewed.

01:12:55.746 --> 01:12:58.122
Can't we just go home?
This is embarrassing.

01:12:58.290 --> 01:13:00.875
No one's going anywhere
until we win this thing.

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:04.420
- Grandpa Buck.
- Yay.

01:13:04.588 --> 01:13:07.924
Okay. Hands in, soldiers.

01:13:12.221 --> 01:13:15.223
It's another beautiful
woodchuck day.

01:13:17.935 --> 01:13:21.938
I knew you'd come back, Grandpa.
We couldn't do this without you.

01:13:22.106 --> 01:13:25.316
That's where you're wrong.
Your dad is the hero.

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:26.526
My dad?

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:33.074
Don't you realise he did
all this just for you?

01:13:34.118 --> 01:13:36.953
You're pretty lucky
to have Charlie Hinton...

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:39.455
...as a father.

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:43.292
He's a better soldier
than I'll ever be.

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:45.920
I could never run a camp
like he can...

01:13:46.088 --> 01:13:48.589
...or watch over you
and your mom like he does.

01:13:49.299 --> 01:13:52.468
He may be a little overprotective...

01:13:52.636 --> 01:13:55.847
...but it's only because
he loves you so much.

01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:07.608
- Colonel, we've got a problem.
- Yeah, dude.

01:14:07.776 --> 01:14:09.861
What's the situation on the ground,
soldiers?

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:13.698
My calculations suggest they've
cheated in nearly every event.

01:14:15.033 --> 01:14:17.034
Cheaters, huh?

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:19.162
Well...

01:14:19.329 --> 01:14:22.957
...the only Way to beat cheaters
is by outsmarting them.

01:14:24.376 --> 01:14:25.877
I've got an idea.

01:14:26.211 --> 01:14:28.629
Okay. Okay, okay.

01:14:28.839 --> 01:14:32.049
First, We're gonna need the skunk.

01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:36.179
Here we go. Come on, good'
thattaway.

01:14:36.346 --> 01:14:38.681
Thattaboy. There We go.

01:14:38.849 --> 01:14:41.642
Ref, come on, man. I'm growing old.

01:14:43.687 --> 01:14:45.229
Look, here he comes.

01:15:36.573 --> 01:15:38.616
Ref. Substitution.

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:26.307
Good job, Robert. Good job.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:28.893
Yeah, thattaway, purple.
There we go, yeah.

01:17:37.569 --> 01:17:40.905
That's too bad, Driftwood.
That's tough luck.

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:44.784
Good hands, though, kid.
Good hands.

01:17:47.412 --> 01:17:52.124
We've got a sharpshooter.
We gotta do something.

01:17:53.710 --> 01:17:56.379
Give me a balloon.

01:17:57.714 --> 01:18:01.550
Billy? The water pump's over there.

01:18:01.718 --> 01:18:05.221
No, I'm not filling it with water.

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:10.559
I've been holding this in all night.

01:18:18.402 --> 01:18:21.779
You shouldn't pick on kids
smaller than you.

01:18:24.783 --> 01:18:27.243
Yeah. Good catch. Good catch.

01:18:27.411 --> 01:18:31.122
It's pee! It's pee! It's pee!

01:18:31.289 --> 01:18:34.709
It's pee! Mom, it's pee!

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:38.295
Yes!

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:46.762
We're the tiebreaker.
We're gonna get the tiebreaker.

01:18:49.474 --> 01:18:53.728
It's another beautiful
woodchuck day.

01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:02.278
Suck it up. Let's go.

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:05.448
Jeez, embarrassing.

01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:13.789
Okay, let's go get them.
Remember what we talked about.

01:19:13.957 --> 01:19:16.667
We need this one.
We need this one.

01:19:17.127 --> 01:19:19.503
That look familiar, Charlie?

01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:22.465
You lose this,
it's déjà vu all over again.

01:19:22.632 --> 01:19:26.177
Yeah, well, I got my best athlete
here' waiting to change history.

01:19:26.344 --> 01:19:28.095
Let's go, buddy, come on.

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:30.681
You okay?

01:19:30.849 --> 01:19:35.144
I twisted my ankle when I fell.
I could shoot the arrow fine, but...

01:19:35.312 --> 01:19:39.523
- But can you climb?
- I don't know. I don't think so.

01:19:39.691 --> 01:19:41.650
You can forfeit,
Charlie, if you like.

01:19:41.818 --> 01:19:45.112
No, no, that's okay.
Who's our best climber?

01:19:51.286 --> 01:19:55.539
- I can do it, Dad.
- All right. Come on, son.

01:19:57.501 --> 01:20:00.294
You're gonna race that kid.
That's gonna be tough, huh?

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:03.005
- Yeah, real tough.
- Like father, like son, huh?

01:20:03.173 --> 01:20:04.882
Don't listen to him. Come on.

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:07.176
All right. Come on, let's go.

01:20:07.344 --> 01:20:09.345
- All right.
- Go get him.

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:12.181
Okay, Ben, listen to me.

01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:14.517
Whatever you do...

01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:18.187
...don't drop the baton, okay?

01:20:19.856 --> 01:20:21.524
Ben.

01:20:21.691 --> 01:20:24.527
Just enjoy it.

01:20:31.243 --> 01:20:32.993
Okay, here it comes.

01:20:33.203 --> 01:20:36.038
All right, focus. Here we go.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:38.332
Come on, Ben.

01:20:57.602 --> 01:20:58.853
Go get him.

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:01.397
- Go Ben!
- Go Ben!

01:21:03.441 --> 01:21:06.694
- Come on. Get up there.
- Come on, Ben.

01:21:06.862 --> 01:21:10.447
- Get them little legs going.
- Come on, Ben.

01:21:10.615 --> 01:21:11.782
Go, Ben.

01:21:12.450 --> 01:21:14.577
Come on, Ben.

01:21:21.293 --> 01:21:23.377
It's okay. It's okay, son.

01:21:23.587 --> 01:21:26.589
I told you, you're a loser,
just like your old man.

01:21:26.756 --> 01:21:28.549
You're not a loser, Ben.

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:32.553
He greased the wall. He's cheating.

01:21:33.263 --> 01:21:37.057
No, don't listen to her.
She's a compulsive liar.

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:39.727
And she steals.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:43.647
- You cheated.
- You're a cheater. You're a cheater.

01:21:43.815 --> 01:21:47.776
Canola cheats. He's cheating.
He's a cheater.

01:21:47.944 --> 01:21:51.614
He's a cheater. Canola cheats.
He's a cheater!

01:21:51.781 --> 01:21:55.618
Ben, no, no. Get down from there.
That's dangerous, Ben.

01:21:55.785 --> 01:21:58.829
Ben. Please, please, Ben.
Ben, get down from there.

01:21:59.956 --> 01:22:02.458
No, no, that's dangerous.
Ben, that's dangerous.

01:22:04.461 --> 01:22:06.086
Pounce, Bobby J. Here We go.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:08.088
Up that wall.

01:22:11.426 --> 01:22:12.843
Bobby J, go, go, go.

01:22:13.011 --> 01:22:14.595
Go!

01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:33.864
That's my baby. That is my...
That's my baby. Yeah!

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:37.618
Oh, whoa, hey, What...? Hey.
All right, Bobby J, come here.

01:22:37.786 --> 01:22:39.662
- Come here, buddy.
- I did it, Daddy.

01:22:39.829 --> 01:22:43.123
- I know it, buddy.
- I love you, Dad.

01:22:44.167 --> 01:22:48.379
I love you too, son.
I love you too, you crazy kid.

01:22:48.546 --> 01:22:50.172
You call that Canola?

01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:52.841
That was embarrassing.
What are you, a moron?

01:22:53.009 --> 01:22:54.969
Moron? You're the moron.

01:23:00.183 --> 01:23:02.518
Wall coming down.

01:23:07.649 --> 01:23:11.568
That's for telling everyone
you're not my dad.

01:23:11.736 --> 01:23:13.862
I'm so excited. I'm so excited.

01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:17.241
Let's go tell my mom.
She's here to pick me up.

01:23:17.409 --> 01:23:20.369
You were really great
in the Egg Relay.

01:23:24.374 --> 01:23:28.335
What'd I tell you?
Chicks love gold medalists.

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:30.879
Teach me everything you know.

01:23:31.047 --> 01:23:34.758
Well, first you got a bird'
and then you got a bee.

01:23:38.972 --> 01:23:43.350
Why?

01:23:47.105 --> 01:23:48.605
Okay.

01:23:48.773 --> 01:23:51.233
- Mr. Hinton?
- Hi.

01:23:51.401 --> 01:23:54.695
All the parents think
Camp Canola may not set...

01:23:54.863 --> 01:23:56.739
...the best example
for our children.

01:23:56.906 --> 01:23:59.908
And so, if it's not
too short of notice...

01:24:00.076 --> 01:24:03.746
...we'd like our kids to come
to your camp as soon as possible.

01:24:03.913 --> 01:24:07.082
Too short notice? Don't be silly.
There's room enough for everyone.

01:24:07.250 --> 01:24:12.087
Yeah, Dale and I can sign all
you guys up. Welcome.

01:24:15.467 --> 01:24:18.510
- It was really my son who did all this.
- Colonel?

01:24:19.262 --> 01:24:21.805
Job well done.

01:24:25.268 --> 01:24:26.894
Just call me Dad.

01:24:36.279 --> 01:24:38.155
Hey, what do you say
we go get the trophy?

01:24:38.323 --> 01:24:41.325
- Yeah!
- Okay.
