1
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:09,166
Attack!

2
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:11,083
Attack!

3
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,750
Go! Come on! Faster!

4
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:21,000
Heinrich, come on! Forwards! Come now!

5
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,791
To the ladders!

6
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:24,291
On my command!

7
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,583
Forwards!

8
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:30,250
Heinrich! Get out there!

9
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,458
All of you, go!

10
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,541
Come on! Get out of there!

11
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:38,666
Go, Heinrich! Get out there now!

12
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,541
Attack!

13
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:42,125
Attack!

14
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,083
Go! Forwards!

15
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,458
Heinrich!

16
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,833
Heinrich!

17
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:26,000
- Attack! Attack!
- Attack!

18
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:14,166
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT

19
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:46,916
Come on!

20
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,666
NORTHERN GERMANY
SPRING 1917

21
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:24,500
THIRD YEAR OF WAR

22
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:44,916
Paul! Paul!

23
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:50,333
- Paul! Well?
- So?

24
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Mhm.

25
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,375
- Well then?
- I don't know.

26
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,378
- Does he know we're all going?
- Yes, of course.

27
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:58,458
Staying at home?

28
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,981
My God, you're tied
to your mother's apron strings, my friend.

29
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,291
Give me it, I'll scribble something.

30
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:07,351
- It has to be signed by his parents.
- Well, someone. Come on, pass it here.

31
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,583
- That won't work, they'll find out.
- How will they?

32
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,083
Well?

33
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,875
Is his mother a pen pal of theirs?

34
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,541
- Give me your pen.
- Ah, I'm sorry.

35
00:09:18,625 --> 00:09:19,458
Oh!

36
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,541
Ludwig.

37
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,125
You mustn't. Your father will hit you.

38
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:26,125
Have you got a better idea?
I'm not being left behind here.

39
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,583
<i>Jawohl!</i>

40
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,833
Congratulations, Private Bäumer.
We're going to the front.

41
00:09:44,916 --> 00:09:46,083
A dead man walking.

42
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:51,458
You stand here
on the threshold of existence.

43
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:54,375
Remember this moment.

44
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,791
It is a great moment.

45
00:09:57,875 --> 00:10:03,000
For in years to come, you will be judged
based on what you dared to become today.

46
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,875
The iron youth of Germany.

47
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,875
My friends,

48
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,166
we are fortunate
to be alive at a great time.

49
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,708
Your deeds will be the water

50
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,791
nourishing the growth
of a strong and noble route.

51
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:19,000
Stand still and listen up, Leinemann!

52
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:21,958
The Kaiser needs soldiers, not children.

53
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,458
I am certain that I will see
most of you again soon, here at home.

54
00:10:29,458 --> 00:10:32,750
Your sword returned to its scabbard
with honour and respect.

55
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:37,541
A cross crafted from iron
proudly displayed upon your chest.

56
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,791
However, take heed of this.

57
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,458
In the darkest of hours,
let me assure you it will happen,

58
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,208
that prior to an attack,
you will harbour doubts.

59
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:51,666
But this is not the time
to concede to any mental weakness.

60
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:56,875
Any unsteadiness, any hesitation
is a betrayal of the fatherland!

61
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,833
For modern war is like a game of chess.

62
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:02,416
It is never about an individual soldier.

63
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,833
Our only care
is for the entirety of the body.

64
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,620
You have the chance to earn the right
to wear the uniforms you have been given.

65
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,625
And by going to the front line
in Flanders, we'll pierce the enemy.

66
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:17,416
And then you will, in a few short weeks,

67
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,125
finally march on Paris!

68
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:21,666
Yeah!

69
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,041
Our future,

70
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,333
the future of <i>Deutschland</i>,

71
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,125
lies in the hands
of its greatest generation.

72
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,833
My friends, that is you, you see!

73
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:33,916
Yeah!

74
00:11:33,958 --> 00:11:35,916
Therefore, off to the camps

75
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,666
for the Kaiser, God, and the fatherland!

76
00:11:39,750 --> 00:11:41,250
Yeah!

77
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,333
Next.

78
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:55,416
Next.

79
00:11:58,833 --> 00:11:59,833
Next.

80
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,267
- Next.
- Next.

81
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,041
Bäumer, Paul.
53 Wiesengrund.

82
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,708
Born November 18th, 1899. Correct?

83
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,791
<i>Jawohl</i>, sir.

84
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:14,375
Next.

85
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:17,125
Paul.

86
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,291
Here. Your father can be proud of you.

87
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,375
Yes.

88
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,125
Is everything alright?

89
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:28,708
Yes. I'm eager to get on with it.

90
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:30,625
Move along.

91
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,583
Here he comes.

92
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:35,434
- Emil Hermann.
- Name and address.

93
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,833
- And the next.
- Excuse me.

94
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,541
It already belongs to someone.

95
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:44,083
Ah, yes. It was probably too small
for the fellow. Happens all the time.

96
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,791
Here. It's yours.

97
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,583
Thank you.

98
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,416
I remember it, you were.

99
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,833
Oh, Ludwig, will you be snatching away
all the ladies from us now?

100
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,000
Yeah.

101
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,000
My concern is that you don't shoot us.

LA MALMAISON, NORTHERN FRANCE
25 KM TO THE WESTERN FRONT

114
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:37,333
- Your name?
- Kropp. Albert Kropp, sir.

115
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,416
Do you like dirty girls,
Kropp?

116
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,583
Do you like dirty girls?

117
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,041
Uh, no. I don't, sir.

118
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,125
So why
do you sleep with one then?

119
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,958
Report for guard duty at three o'clock.

120
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,833
Gentlemen, you'll be fighting
in a godforsaken shithole.

121
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:59,833
And you'll kindly do so with a clean G98.

122
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,458
You will pamper it.

123
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,000
You will love it.

124
00:15:03,083 --> 00:15:05,208
And damn it,
you will keep it as immaculate

125
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:07,166
as the thighs of the Holy Virgin.

126
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:09,166
Do we understand each other?

127
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:10,916
<i>- Jawohl</i>, sir!
<i>- Jawohl</i>, sir!

128
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,875
Welcome
to the 78th Reserve Infantry Regiment.

129
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:17,083
We are now on the Western Front.

130
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,666
- Welcome to Paris!
- Yeah! Welcome to Paris!

131
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,208
Ah!

132
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:31,958
Down there! Down there!

133
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,625
Down there! This way!

134
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:42,945
This way!

135
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:53,031
- Go on! Over there on the right!
- Damn it, what happened?

136
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,291
I have orders to hand over the company
to the front by 6:00 p.m.

137
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,875
That you may, but on foot.

138
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,975
You must give us the trucks, lieutenant.

139
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,517
With all due respect, I have orders...

140
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:03,500
Take the orders
and stick them up your arse.

141
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,583
I have 40 men here
who are dying in the mud.

142
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:06,875
Get out right now, will you?

143
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,000
Everyone, get up.

144
00:16:12,583 --> 00:16:14,291
Come on, get on with it.

145
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,125
You heard the staff surgeon.

146
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:22,166
Faster, soldiers. Don't fall asleep here.

147
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,708
Keep moving.

148
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,541
- Franz Müller, correct?
- Yes.

149
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,125
The supreme army command

150
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:38,916
expects you to survive
at least six weeks of being here.

151
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,059
Would you like that,
in six weeks, to still be alive?

152
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,403
<i>- Jawohl</i>, sir.
- Then walk quicker

153
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,578
and stop dragging your feet
like you would do at home.

154
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,958
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

155
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,125
Hurry up.

156
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:51,708
We're not at a tea party here.

157
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,125
Gas!

158
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,958
- Gas!
- Gas!

159
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,666
Gas!

160
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,958
Gas!

161
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,833
Gas masks on!

162
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,458
That, gentlemen, was a fat pig.

163
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,875
If the French could aim better,

164
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:18,291
you could scrape us all off the road
with a spoon and bury us in a saucepan.

165
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,250
But one thing
that's as certain as amen in church.

166
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,083
Fat pigs don't carry gas.

167
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,125
Eyes straight ahead.

168
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,666
- Are you deaf?
- No, sir.

169
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:48,458
I was just trying to put my mask on.

170
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:59,500
Paul Bäumer,
you will almost certainly be dead by dawn.

171
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,041
You should eat something, man.

172
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:06,375
Attention! Gas masks off!

173
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,333
Gas masks off!

174
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,500
Not you.

175
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:12,041
You keep yours on
until guard duty tonight.

176
00:18:12,875 --> 00:18:14,708
Both you and that useless pig.

177
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,583
Fall in line. March.

178
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:18,875
Fall in line!

179
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:21,375
Stay together and keep moving!

180
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,166
Come on, hurry up!

181
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,083
Go!

182
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:45,166
Come on. Paul, come on.
Give me your knapsack.

183
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,000
Next time, you carry mine.

184
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,250
Congratulations, soldiers.

185
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,166
This is your home now.

186
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,250
Helmets off.

187
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,541
I see the men have been enjoying
themselves in my absence, Steinberger.

188
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,416
We were under barrage all night.

189
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,583
The men are a mess.

190
00:19:11,666 --> 00:19:13,666
I think dry boots
would be a good place to begin.

191
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:15,791
Oh, you'd rather we all drown then?

192
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:18,833
Everyone pitch in!
Come on, bail out the trench.

193
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:22,375
Get in line
to bail the water!

194
00:19:24,458 --> 00:19:26,208
What are you waiting for, Bäumer?

195
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:31,083
Why are you still loitering here?
Go and help bail out the trenches.

196
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,666
Throw a dog a piece of meat.

197
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,291
Come on, all of you!

198
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,958
It will always snap it up.

199
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,875
Give a man power...

200
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,333
Man is a beast.

201
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:46,583
Drink.

202
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,375
Katczinsky, come over here.
Give us a hand.

203
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:00,125
Tonight, it'll be even worse.

204
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,125
Sorry.

205
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,041
Forget it.

206
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,458
Somehow, this isn't how I imagined it.

207
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:37,541
Just shut up, Ludwig.

208
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:41,375
My hands. I can't feel my hands any more.

209
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,750
Stick them down your underwear.

210
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,458
It always works for me.

211
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,545
That will make it shoot better,
will it?

212
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:50,836
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

213
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,708
That sound. Listen.

214
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:55,041
There's nothing there.

215
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,291
Our first French to shoot.

216
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,291
Calm down, Paulchen.

217
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:15,706
There's someone out there.

218
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:27,791
Who's there?

219
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:30,375
Hey.

220
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:33,915
Show yourself!

221
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:53,416
Oh, no, no, no!

222
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,333
I'm hit! I'm hit! I've been hit! Get off!

223
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:59,375
- No, Paul. No.
- What's going on?

224
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:00,541
You're fine.

225
00:23:07,916 --> 00:23:08,916
What is it?

226
00:23:09,666 --> 00:23:11,333
The others, over there. They shot at me.

227
00:23:17,333 --> 00:23:18,875
They saw the flash of your muzzle.

228
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,250
Huh?

229
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,791
From now on, keep your heads down.

230
00:23:22,875 --> 00:23:25,184
If you don't want to catch
the next bullet with your teeth,

231
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,328
move ten meters to the left.

232
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:29,125
Shoot, change cover.
Shoot, change cover. Understand?

233
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,875
Yeah.

234
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:48,291
Come on. Paul.

235
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:41,083
Take cover! Take cover! Alarm!

236
00:24:44,041 --> 00:24:45,083
Here!

237
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:48,333
Bäumer, come here. Quickly, come on.

238
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Into the bunker!

239
00:24:53,625 --> 00:24:55,875
Inside! Inside! Inside!

240
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:15,458
"Be careful what you eat."

241
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:19,000
That's what my mother said.

242
00:25:21,416 --> 00:25:23,176
- We'll always be together, won't we?
- Yeah.

243
00:25:23,208 --> 00:25:24,791
We'll stick together. We'll always be.

244
00:25:26,708 --> 00:25:30,166
I can't do this, Paul.
I can't do this. I need to go home.

245
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:31,490
I need to go home.

246
00:25:52,166 --> 00:25:53,208
Creeping barrage.

247
00:25:57,083 --> 00:25:58,208
What?

248
00:25:59,458 --> 00:26:00,458
Every couple of minutes,

249
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,416
the artillery barrage
makes an advance forward.

250
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:04,916
And directly after that,

251
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,583
the infantry moves forward.

252
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,458
What are you saying, exactly?

253
00:26:11,166 --> 00:26:12,250
That's how they come.

254
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:34,291
Where are you going?

255
00:26:34,375 --> 00:26:35,375
I'll come back.

256
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,125
It's nearly over.

257
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:41,041
- No! Let me go.
- Stay where you are.

258
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,625
- Let me out of here. I want to get out.
- Calm down.

259
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,083
Calm yourself.

260
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:51,583
No!

261
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,208
Get out! Out! Out! Out!

262
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Out!

263
00:28:00,833 --> 00:28:02,791
Hey, that's Paul!

264
00:28:02,875 --> 00:28:03,750
Albert!

265
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:05,666
Come here, we found Paul!

266
00:28:14,416 --> 00:28:15,416
Paul!

267
00:28:17,708 --> 00:28:18,708
Are you alright?

268
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,333
Is everything alright, Paul?

269
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,583
Come on. Paul, come on.

270
00:28:23,666 --> 00:28:24,833
I'll help you.

271
00:28:24,916 --> 00:28:27,458
Come on. Get up, will you? Sit down.

272
00:28:27,541 --> 00:28:28,625
Are you injured?

273
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,541
Paul, are you injured?

274
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,583
- Can you hear me?
- We need help over here!

275
00:28:32,666 --> 00:28:34,666
- See you later, Paul.
- We'll see you later, Paul.

276
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:48,250
Go on! Go on!

277
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,208
Here's another one.

278
00:28:54,041 --> 00:28:55,125
We need help!

279
00:28:58,708 --> 00:28:59,708
Steady.

280
00:29:00,541 --> 00:29:01,541
Steady.

281
00:29:06,708 --> 00:29:07,708
That's it.

282
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:10,666
I've got you.

283
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:14,041
Careful, careful.

284
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:25,375
Now we're in camp. Sit down.

285
00:29:25,458 --> 00:29:26,458
You're alright.

286
00:29:27,541 --> 00:29:29,166
Nice one. Let's have a look at you.

287
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:31,500
Hold still, hold still.

288
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:34,986
Yeah, you're going to be alright.

289
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:39,005
Right, put pressure on it.
Don't let him get up.

290
00:29:51,791 --> 00:29:53,666
Katczinsky, back to work.

291
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,291
And you? Are you injured?

292
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:56,791
No.

293
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:58,666
Then start gathering.

294
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:00,416
Man, man, man!

295
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,416
No rest for the wicked.

296
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:11,416
It's the same every day.

297
00:33:08,041 --> 00:33:09,791
Come on! Keep working!

298
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:11,791
We don't have all day.

299
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,791
Albrecht, Karl. Diepholz.

300
00:34:28,875 --> 00:34:29,708
18 MONTHS LATER

301
00:34:29,791 --> 00:34:32,875
September 14th, 1898.

302
00:34:37,666 --> 00:34:40,375
Blumenthal, Samuel.

303
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:45,625
Dresden. November 6th, 1900.

304
00:34:47,041 --> 00:34:48,416
Yesterday was his birthday.

305
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,416
Von Gallwitz, Gustav.

306
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:59,833
Osnabrück, June 20th, '99.

307
00:35:01,416 --> 00:35:02,666
Götz Lüttwitz...

308
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:03,750
That's enough.

309
00:35:13,291 --> 00:35:15,666
SUPREME ARMY COMMAND
7 NOVEMBER, 1918

310
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,583
- She's a looker.
- Let's see.

311
00:35:17,666 --> 00:35:18,666
She's alright.

312
00:35:41,541 --> 00:35:42,583
Herr Erzberger.

313
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:53,333
God be with us.

314
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:57,666
Once more, over 40,000 killed
in the last few weeks alone.

315
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:01,250
That should convince the general staff.

316
00:36:02,791 --> 00:36:04,916
I think the gentlemen know it's over.

317
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,583
We all know that.

318
00:36:13,916 --> 00:36:15,250
The General Field Marshal.

319
00:36:18,375 --> 00:36:19,375
Mm.

320
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,041
CHAMPAGNE, FRANCE
OCCUPIED TERRITORY

321
00:37:01,375 --> 00:37:03,125
- Thank you.
<i>- Jawohl</i>.

322
00:37:15,791 --> 00:37:17,231
Paul, if we keep up this pace,

323
00:37:17,291 --> 00:37:19,708
we won't have conquered France
for 180 years.

324
00:37:20,750 --> 00:37:23,500
I worked it out.

325
00:37:23,583 --> 00:37:25,166
Don't let them catch you, Kat.

326
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:27,875
Never.

327
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,083
Come on.

328
00:37:42,083 --> 00:37:44,250
Explain to me
how this is worth dying for in your mind.

329
00:37:46,416 --> 00:37:48,056
When you're starving, you'll do anything.

330
00:38:30,250 --> 00:38:31,250
<i>Qui va là?</i>

331
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:34,958
<i>Ho!</i>

332
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:37,541
<i>Oh, putain!</i>

333
00:38:42,541 --> 00:38:45,416
<i>Attends je vais flinguer ce fumier!</i>

334
00:38:45,916 --> 00:38:46,916
Kat?

335
00:38:49,541 --> 00:38:50,541
Kat?

336
00:38:51,875 --> 00:38:52,708
Run!

337
00:38:52,791 --> 00:38:54,271
Hey! Dirty Kraut!

338
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:56,791
<i>- Rends-moi l'oie, ordure!</i>
- Run!

339
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,166
<i>Fumier!</i>

340
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,690
- Just right.
- I told you.

341
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:18,958
Men, you are heroes.

342
00:39:19,041 --> 00:39:20,721
Shut the door or the others will smell it.

343
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:25,083
Nice work.

344
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:27,246
I don't know. How am I
supposed to remember anything?

345
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,625
Come on, use your Prussian brain.

346
00:39:28,708 --> 00:39:30,375
Here. Open-eyed and long-fingered.

347
00:39:30,458 --> 00:39:31,833
Help me with the goose.

348
00:39:31,916 --> 00:39:34,875
A piece of goose from the goose.
From France to Franz.

349
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:35,958
I want a wing.

350
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:38,041
Do I have to share?
Then I'll take the rest.

351
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,125
Fill up my bowl.

352
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43,416
Come here, you blind hen.
Wide-mouth frog...

353
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,791
- Rest in peace in the drumfire.
- Ooh.

354
00:39:46,583 --> 00:39:47,916
Oh, God.

355
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,625
You know I'll owe you forever for this.

356
00:39:51,083 --> 00:39:52,291
Mm.

357
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:17,583
It's not bad, is it?

358
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,583
Yes. Mm.

359
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,375
- And you?
- Yes. Yes, good.

360
00:40:25,416 --> 00:40:26,541
It's good, Paul.

361
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,666
Good, Kat.

362
00:40:27,750 --> 00:40:28,833
Life is short.

363
00:40:29,416 --> 00:40:33,041
- Where's Emil when you need him?
- Emil, bring in coffee and caviar!

364
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:36,083
Yes, and draw my foot bath as well.
I need a foot bath.

365
00:40:37,875 --> 00:40:39,750
- Kat?
- What is it?

366
00:40:41,125 --> 00:40:43,583
<i>♪ The goose has been stolen
Give it back ♪</i>

367
00:40:43,666 --> 00:40:45,250
<i>♪ Give it, give it, give it back</i> ♪

368
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:47,500
<i>♪ The goose has been stolen
Give it back ♪</i>

369
00:40:47,583 --> 00:40:49,750
- The farmer! The farmer!
- The farmer! Yes!

370
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:52,958
<i>♪ Otherwise the farmer
Will shoot you with his rifle</i> ♪

371
00:40:53,041 --> 00:40:56,750
<i>♪ Otherwise the farmer
Will shoot you with his rifle</i> ♪

372
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,666
<i>♪ Shoot you with his rifle ♪</i>

373
00:41:21,791 --> 00:41:23,471
Tjaden sits very quietly and says...

374
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:26,208
"Where is he?"
"Cross." I keep hearing, "Cross."

375
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,333
"My father was leader of Nazareth."

376
00:41:28,875 --> 00:41:31,416
"Leader of Nazareth?"
enquires the teacher.

377
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,041
"What?" "Never heard of it."

378
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:35,083
"Tjaden, go back home
and ask again, will you?"

379
00:41:35,583 --> 00:41:38,875
Next morning, Tjaden springs into school
and says to everybody,

380
00:41:38,958 --> 00:41:42,166
"Please forgive me."
"My father wasn't the leader of Nazareth."

381
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,388
"My father was last seen with Nadja Roth."

382
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:49,375
Brilliant.

383
00:41:55,708 --> 00:41:56,708
Look.

384
00:41:57,083 --> 00:41:58,083
Mhm?

385
00:42:15,916 --> 00:42:17,875
<i>Regarder!</i>

386
00:42:20,666 --> 00:42:21,833
Hey! Hello!

387
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:24,166
Come here!

388
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,333
Fresh baguette!

389
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:28,250
For you!

390
00:42:28,791 --> 00:42:30,208
Liverwurst, love!

391
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:31,875
Lots of love!

392
00:42:46,291 --> 00:42:47,875
Franz. What are you doing?

393
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:52,333
- Take me with you.
- Come on!

394
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:58,833
I'd go over.

395
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:01,541
But he's making a fool of himself.

396
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:05,541
Oh, my.
You are very beautiful, my love.

397
00:43:07,333 --> 00:43:08,208
Franz!

398
00:43:08,291 --> 00:43:10,166
The dark-haired beauty
is for me!

399
00:43:20,166 --> 00:43:21,375
What is he doing?

400
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:28,166
Franz!

401
00:43:29,666 --> 00:43:31,041
Goodbye!

402
00:43:31,666 --> 00:43:33,708
Goodbye, my friends!

403
00:43:44,291 --> 00:43:45,375
Damn it.

404
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:50,500
If it was all over,
you know what I'd be doing?

405
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:52,291
There's no peace,
so it doesn't matter.

406
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,655
No, but if there was...

407
00:43:54,250 --> 00:43:57,208
- We'd be surrounded by women again.
- Yeah, that's true.

408
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:00,541
I wouldn't put trousers on
for eight days.

409
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:03,833
I should really be spanking your backside
for talking about something like that.

410
00:44:03,916 --> 00:44:05,000
What about you, Paul?

411
00:44:06,458 --> 00:44:09,666
- No idea. Can't think.
- I'd stay with the Prussians.

412
00:44:10,208 --> 00:44:11,528
You're an idiot, Tjaden.

413
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,968
Have you ever done
any peat digging?

414
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,125
Try it sometime.

415
00:44:15,208 --> 00:44:17,528
Can't be worse
than digging trenches in Champagne.

416
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:19,583
It takes longer
than digging trenches in Champagne.

417
00:44:19,625 --> 00:44:21,265
And you can't get away with not doing it.

418
00:44:21,875 --> 00:44:24,500
In peacetime military life,
you have no concerns.

419
00:44:25,041 --> 00:44:27,541
Mornings, food's there
or else you're not there.

420
00:44:28,291 --> 00:44:30,000
And then you have the softest bed.

421
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:31,875
Every week with fresh sheets over it.

422
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:32,958
And then...

423
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,083
And before you know it, I'm a corporal.

424
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:40,166
Imagine that.
Me becoming a military policeman.

425
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:42,083
A Cognac here, a pint there.

426
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:45,250
A military policeman
is everyone's good friend. Everyone.

427
00:44:45,333 --> 00:44:46,916
There's just one catch, Tjaden.

428
00:44:48,375 --> 00:44:49,416
What's that?

429
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:51,666
You'll never be a corporal though,
will you?

430
00:45:01,416 --> 00:45:03,416
You always make such useless comments.

431
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,180
What does it matter what you think anyway?

432
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:23,000
- Kat! Kat!
- Here!

433
00:45:23,083 --> 00:45:24,125
- Kat!
- Here!

434
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,208
Kat!

435
00:46:21,458 --> 00:46:22,458
"Darling one."

436
00:46:23,333 --> 00:46:25,291
"You asked us
for a package of food to be sent."

437
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:28,458
"Four portions of sausage
are on their way with lard."

438
00:46:30,875 --> 00:46:33,125
"A couple of pieces of cake."

439
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,000
"Sauerkraut and smoked wurst."

440
00:46:36,958 --> 00:46:37,958
"Some more..."

441
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,791
- Hing? Hingfong?
- Hingfong.

442
00:46:41,291 --> 00:46:42,416
"...and a cup of sugar."

443
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:46,083
"Eggs and a glass of plum jam in there."

444
00:46:46,916 --> 00:46:49,756
"Don't eat too quickly as I don't want
to have to send more right away."

445
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:52,873
"I'd keep it away
from your comrades if I were you."

446
00:46:54,416 --> 00:46:55,416
"My dear one."

447
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:57,875
"I must also ask a question of you."

448
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:00,375
"Have you started to save up any money?"

449
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:03,375
"Could you send some home
would you think?"

450
00:47:04,208 --> 00:47:06,875
"People are saying the war
will be over soon." "Some people."

451
00:47:07,625 --> 00:47:09,833
"And so it would be helpful
to have some saved up."

452
00:47:10,916 --> 00:47:12,796
"You're probably thinking,
'What is she after?'"

453
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:14,541
"'How cheeky of her to ask.'"

454
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,333
"But I mean not to offend you."

455
00:47:17,416 --> 00:47:19,708
"You know me, I can never get enough."

456
00:47:20,291 --> 00:47:22,958
"But more, more." "I can't help it,
I always want some more."

457
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,875
"So make sure not to fall over
before you can come home."

458
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:31,000
"Karl Lemmer is in a hospital bed
somewhere in the East."

459
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,660
"Something with his stomach."

460
00:47:33,208 --> 00:47:35,458
"And he was out there
for barely three weeks in total."

461
00:47:37,041 --> 00:47:39,500
"Can't you also be sick,
with your rheumatism?"

462
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:42,750
"You've already played your role."

463
00:47:44,125 --> 00:47:47,291
If only she could see
how you're sitting there, with your cigar.

464
00:47:51,375 --> 00:47:53,083
"This Sunday, I'll visit the gra..."

465
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,291
"This Sunday,
I'll visit the grave of our boy."

466
00:48:05,708 --> 00:48:08,791
"I'll make sure to read to him
as you remember he loved that."

467
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:14,375
"By next year, we'll be able to celebrate
his tenth birthday together."

468
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:18,888
"That's all I have to tell you this time."

469
00:48:19,583 --> 00:48:21,833
"Sending kisses from your wife, for you."

470
00:48:22,541 --> 00:48:23,541
"<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>."

471
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:31,000
I had no idea.

472
00:48:40,333 --> 00:48:41,666
Oh, Paul.

473
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,375
How is all this going to work out, hmm?

474
00:48:50,291 --> 00:48:51,666
Returning to a home,

475
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,916
having to go back to our normal being.

476
00:48:55,916 --> 00:48:59,125
Where all everyone wants to know about
are the battles we've been in.

477
00:49:01,958 --> 00:49:05,291
We'll be like travellers
who belong in another country elsewhere.

478
00:49:08,416 --> 00:49:09,666
Sometimes I wonder...

479
00:49:10,708 --> 00:49:11,708
Would...

480
00:49:11,791 --> 00:49:15,166
Would I be happier with you here at camp?

481
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:17,000
Tjaden and Kropp.

482
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:20,083
And with Müller. He'd be sat with us.

483
00:49:21,791 --> 00:49:23,333
And be eating fried potatoes.

484
00:49:24,125 --> 00:49:25,125
Unpeeled.

485
00:49:32,083 --> 00:49:33,125
Well...

486
00:49:44,916 --> 00:49:46,041
That's enough of that.

487
00:49:48,875 --> 00:49:51,208
How long until we finally get going again?

488
00:49:51,958 --> 00:49:54,833
How long
until we finally get going again?

489
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,375
Franz?

490
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,000
Yes?

491
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,250
Tomorrow, we're up at six o'clock.

492
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:20,875
To look for some children.

493
00:50:21,708 --> 00:50:22,708
What happened?

494
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:25,833
They should have arrived today.

495
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:27,375
A whole company.

496
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:33,250
How was it?

497
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:38,666
- Good.
- Yeah?

498
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:40,416
Yes.

499
00:50:42,708 --> 00:50:43,708
Here.

500
00:50:48,958 --> 00:50:49,958
Have a smell.

501
00:51:02,416 --> 00:51:03,750
What's her name?

502
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:04,833
Eloise.

503
00:51:07,583 --> 00:51:08,583
Eloise.

504
00:51:09,541 --> 00:51:12,708
She had skin as white as milk.

505
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:16,666
Breasts...

506
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,500
- Hey.
- Huh?

507
00:51:20,083 --> 00:51:21,363
I want to smell it too.

508
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:26,208
Kropp, let me have it.

509
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:28,791
- Here.
- Oh, my.

510
00:51:28,875 --> 00:51:29,750
Give it to me.

511
00:51:29,833 --> 00:51:32,708
A girl like that
never has dirt under her nails.

512
00:51:32,791 --> 00:51:35,083
- No.
- At worst, some sand from the seashore.

513
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:36,958
Tjaden.

514
00:51:37,041 --> 00:51:39,601
- Come on, pass it here.
- I bet she bathes twice a day.

515
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:46,166
Tjaden, give it back to me.

516
00:52:01,416 --> 00:52:02,416
Sir.

517
00:52:10,708 --> 00:52:11,875
Call the others.

518
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,333
There must have been a huge explosion.

519
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,875
Mine thrower cannons.

520
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:57,666
He's been blasted
right out of his uniform.

521
00:53:03,083 --> 00:53:04,683
Was he one of those we've come here for?

522
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:07,583
No, they've only been missing
since yesterday.

523
00:53:08,583 --> 00:53:10,423
He's been hanging there
for some time.

524
00:53:11,208 --> 00:53:12,208
Not pleasant.

525
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,375
Don't get soft now, men.

526
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:16,441
How many are we looking for?

527
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:18,041
Sixty young recruits.

528
00:53:25,541 --> 00:53:26,958
Breakfast is turnip bread.

529
00:53:27,458 --> 00:53:28,938
Same at lunchtime, it's turnip bread.

530
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,583
I'm surrounded by turnip bread.
I can't face it any more.

531
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:34,958
Let me know when you find them.
I'm not going any further.

532
00:53:35,875 --> 00:53:36,875
Gas.

533
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:41,083
There was gas here.

534
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:25,000
Shit!

535
00:55:00,666 --> 00:55:01,666
Hello, madam.

536
00:55:05,291 --> 00:55:06,291
I'm Kropp.

537
00:55:10,791 --> 00:55:11,791
And you?

538
00:55:18,583 --> 00:55:19,583
Mm.

539
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:25,083
Do you want to...

540
00:55:29,333 --> 00:55:30,916
Do you want to come with me?

541
00:55:33,083 --> 00:55:34,083
Not a problem.

542
00:56:28,333 --> 00:56:29,333
Kat?

543
00:56:32,083 --> 00:56:33,083
Kat.

544
00:56:34,750 --> 00:56:35,750
Kat!

545
00:56:45,583 --> 00:56:46,583
Shit.

546
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:54,666
- Flipping idiots.
- Uh huh.

547
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:58,208
Stupid boys.
They took their masks off too soon.

548
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:03,166
Germany will soon be empty.

549
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:24,791
COMPIÈGNE, FRANCE
8 NOVEMBER, 1918

550
00:58:26,375 --> 00:58:27,375
General.

551
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:31,333
Well, Brixdorf, what's the latest?

552
00:58:31,416 --> 00:58:33,041
The French are increasing the pressure.

553
00:58:33,125 --> 00:58:35,833
Early this morning,
our reconnaissance intercepted orders

554
00:58:35,916 --> 00:58:38,250
summoning entire divisions to Latierre.

555
00:58:38,333 --> 00:58:41,083
A tank fleet is still reportedly
still stuck at Fernancourt.

556
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:42,875
Must mean an attack is likely.

557
00:58:44,375 --> 00:58:47,416
The social democrats
will be the end of mankind, Brixdorf.

558
00:58:49,958 --> 00:58:50,958
General?

559
00:58:55,416 --> 00:58:58,333
I have just put a German delegation
to the armistice negotiations

560
00:58:58,416 --> 00:58:59,916
on the train to Compiègne.

561
00:59:07,041 --> 00:59:10,500
These people, Brixdorf,
are selling out our fatherland.

562
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:13,583
My orders are war.

563
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:18,333
And all the while that is the case,
I shall fight for every meter.

564
00:59:20,666 --> 00:59:23,083
We have to hold on now
and wait for fresh troops.

565
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:25,916
In a few months, the incoming class
of recruits will be here.

566
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:28,958
The French are trying everything they can

567
00:59:29,041 --> 00:59:31,583
to force
their completely unacceptable terms on us.

568
00:59:34,208 --> 00:59:35,875
I will not capitulate.

569
00:59:38,750 --> 00:59:41,666
We must strike without delay.
With all our might.

570
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,000
General.

571
01:00:10,250 --> 01:00:11,500
From our position,

572
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,791
I have to be clear...

573
01:00:15,916 --> 01:00:17,333
We all have to be clear...

574
01:00:18,791 --> 01:00:19,875
For God's sake.

575
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:21,458
Shit.

576
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:54,875
Sir!

577
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,125
Soldiers, pack your bags,

578
01:01:07,208 --> 01:01:09,958
roll up your bedding,
and wash your mess kits.

579
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:13,333
The whole regiment will advance
to the front firing position.

580
01:01:13,416 --> 01:01:16,583
And I mean everyone
who's able to stand on two legs is going.

581
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,791
Line up, for God's sake.

582
01:01:20,375 --> 01:01:23,583
You think the Frenchies will wait
for you to comb your pubes?

583
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:25,392
- Here we go again.
- Get moving!

584
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:28,041
- Where to?
- Where to? Where to?

585
01:01:28,541 --> 01:01:29,541
Into battle.

586
01:03:04,791 --> 01:03:06,666
Monsieur le Maréchal is awaiting you.

587
01:04:14,375 --> 01:04:15,541
I'll come back for you.

588
01:04:31,083 --> 01:04:32,166
Envious, huh?

589
01:04:50,291 --> 01:04:51,541
I stand before you

590
01:04:52,083 --> 01:04:56,000
in the hope that you will take
our presence here today as an opportunity

591
01:04:56,083 --> 01:04:58,750
to take action to suspend all hostilities.

592
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,750
In the name of humanity,

593
01:05:02,541 --> 01:05:05,541
I'm here asking you for an agreement
to an immediate cease-fire

594
01:05:05,625 --> 01:05:08,708
for the entire duration
of our negotiating time

595
01:05:08,791 --> 01:05:12,166
in order to spare
our nation's unnecessary depletion.

596
01:05:14,166 --> 01:05:17,416
Matthias Erzberger,
head of the German delegation.

597
01:05:27,333 --> 01:05:29,293
Weygand,
what do these gentlemen want?

598
01:05:30,166 --> 01:05:31,666
I don't know.

599
01:05:31,750 --> 01:05:34,625
Marshal Foch asks
what brings you gentlemen to him.

600
01:05:38,625 --> 01:05:40,666
We are here looking forward to hearing

601
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:44,250
your proposal for an enduring cease-fire

602
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:47,458
that will include all those on the water,
on land, as well as in the sky.

603
01:05:51,625 --> 01:05:53,666
I have no proposal
of this kind to make.

604
01:05:56,708 --> 01:05:57,791
What does he mean by that?

605
01:05:58,625 --> 01:06:01,791
I think he disliked the phrasing
of what you said.

606
01:06:03,333 --> 01:06:04,333
Yes.

607
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:05,958
Good, then...

608
01:06:09,541 --> 01:06:10,625
Monsieur Le Maréchal,

609
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:14,375
If you please,
we would like to know the conditions...

610
01:06:23,416 --> 01:06:25,500
He wants you
to ask for it, formally.

611
01:06:33,083 --> 01:06:34,375
Monsieur le Maréchal,

612
01:06:36,750 --> 01:06:38,708
I am asking you for an armistice.

613
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:43,041
We are asking
for an armistice.

614
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:50,791
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

615
01:06:50,875 --> 01:06:53,059
You have 72 hours
to accept our conditions.

616
01:06:53,083 --> 01:06:55,000
They are non-negotiable.

617
01:06:55,083 --> 01:06:56,458
Seventy-two hours?

618
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:58,221
The war will continue until you sign them.

619
01:06:58,250 --> 01:06:59,333
Monsieur le Maréchal,

620
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:03,125
in God's name,
don't let 72 hours pass us by here.

621
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:07,145
Thousands of lives depend on it.

622
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:13,958
Sign then.

623
01:07:29,916 --> 01:07:30,916
Understood.

624
01:07:49,958 --> 01:07:51,583
- Soldiers, we'll march.
- Sir.

625
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:56,041
Soldiers, march.

626
01:07:57,333 --> 01:07:58,333
March, soldiers.

627
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:02,416
Soldiers, march.

628
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,166
Off you go, get out of here.

629
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,291
March, soldiers.

630
01:08:08,916 --> 01:08:09,916
March.

631
01:08:10,833 --> 01:08:11,833
Soldiers, march.

632
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,958
March, soldiers. Off you go.

633
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:06,250
Go, go, go!

634
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,666
<i>Atención aux arbalètes...</i>

635
01:10:00,916 --> 01:10:02,750
<i>Allez! Allez les gars!</i>

636
01:10:04,250 --> 01:10:05,250
<i>Allez! Allez!</i>

637
01:10:35,375 --> 01:10:38,208
Keep going, Paul. Come on. Paul!

638
01:10:45,666 --> 01:10:46,666
<i>Allez!</i>

639
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:56,791
<i>Au renfort!</i>

640
01:11:15,125 --> 01:11:16,500
<i>Putain, putain, non, non!</i>

641
01:12:01,416 --> 01:12:02,333
Get out!

642
01:12:08,041 --> 01:12:09,250
What is that?

643
01:12:10,416 --> 01:12:11,416
Get out!

644
01:12:13,166 --> 01:12:15,250
- Here!
- Quick, quick, quick! Move it!

645
01:12:15,333 --> 01:12:16,541
Get out!

646
01:12:16,625 --> 01:12:17,458
There, there, look!

647
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,581
- What is it?
- Down there.

648
01:12:18,625 --> 01:12:19,458
What is it?

649
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:55,291
Open fire!

650
01:12:56,083 --> 01:12:57,916
Open fire!

651
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,166
All down!

652
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,375
Get down!

653
01:14:07,791 --> 01:14:09,833
Boys, think fast! Be smart!

654
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:33,708
Get the hand grenades out!

655
01:14:34,541 --> 01:14:36,916
Throw them in the vehicle
when they're on top of us.

656
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:05,333
Get out!

657
01:15:06,083 --> 01:15:07,125
Get up!

658
01:15:15,666 --> 01:15:16,500
Franz!

659
01:15:16,583 --> 01:15:18,083
Follow me. Come on, follow me!

660
01:15:20,208 --> 01:15:21,208
Franz!

661
01:15:22,208 --> 01:15:23,291
Paul!

662
01:16:07,416 --> 01:16:08,625
Paul.

663
01:16:08,708 --> 01:16:09,708
Paul!

664
01:16:25,541 --> 01:16:26,750
Open fire!

665
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:41,583
Retreat!

666
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:43,916
Retreat!

667
01:17:59,625 --> 01:18:02,250
No, no, no! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! No!

668
01:18:02,333 --> 01:18:05,125
Please, please, no! No, no, no!

669
01:18:05,208 --> 01:18:08,250
No, wait, wait, don't shoot.
Don't shoot. Don't shoot. No.

670
01:18:08,333 --> 01:18:09,333
- No, no!
- Albert.

671
01:18:17,583 --> 01:18:19,708
Come on, come on.

672
01:18:19,791 --> 01:18:21,166
Come on!

673
01:18:26,875 --> 01:18:27,875
Keep going!

674
01:18:54,083 --> 01:18:55,333
Where is Franz?

675
01:18:55,416 --> 01:18:56,666
I've left Franz alone!

676
01:19:04,166 --> 01:19:05,291
Katczinsky!

677
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:07,750
Take the machine gun and retreat.

678
01:19:07,833 --> 01:19:10,583
We'll regroup in Eguisac,
two kilometres northeast.

679
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,666
I miss my comrades, sir. I miss them all!

680
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,041
I miss my mother, for God's sake.

681
01:19:18,125 --> 01:19:20,666
Grenades, ammunition! Come on!

682
01:19:22,541 --> 01:19:23,666
Paul, come on!

683
01:19:31,916 --> 01:19:33,875
Get out of here! Let's go!

684
01:19:51,625 --> 01:19:54,250
These aren't negotiations,
this is a dictate.

685
01:19:54,333 --> 01:19:57,666
Maybe we should return to Spa
to consult with the general staff.

686
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,708
And what expectations
do you have for that?

687
01:19:59,791 --> 01:20:02,166
Even if we end up
losing definitively after all,

688
01:20:02,250 --> 01:20:04,583
we won't be worse off
than we are with this surrender.

689
01:20:04,666 --> 01:20:06,666
Except for
a few hundred thousand extra deaths.

690
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,583
Alsace-Lorraine,
occupation of the Rhineland,

691
01:20:08,666 --> 01:20:10,833
cannons, locomotives,
trains, and whatever else.

692
01:20:10,916 --> 01:20:13,041
You are aware,
this is a total capitulation.

693
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:17,458
250,000 Americans
are landing each month in Europe.

694
01:20:17,541 --> 01:20:21,083
Marne, Cantigny, Cambrai.
All of those lost.

695
01:20:22,125 --> 01:20:24,125
All that's left
separating us from an armistice

696
01:20:24,208 --> 01:20:25,791
is false pride, as I see it.

697
01:20:25,875 --> 01:20:27,235
Thanks to you and your commanders,

698
01:20:27,291 --> 01:20:29,458
we're here dealing with the mess
left by them.

699
01:20:29,541 --> 01:20:32,000
I'm happy for you to depart here,
it's down to you.

700
01:20:32,083 --> 01:20:33,208
We are remaining here.

701
01:20:39,666 --> 01:20:40,750
It is winter.

702
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:45,041
Without trains and provisions,
Bolshevism will take over.

703
01:20:45,875 --> 01:20:47,875
On their way home,
the men will die of hunger

704
01:20:47,958 --> 01:20:50,375
instead of dying
with honour on the battlefield.

705
01:20:51,625 --> 01:20:52,625
Honour?

706
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:57,291
My son was killed in the war.
He doesn't feel any honour.

707
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:04,708
Von Helldorf.

708
01:21:05,708 --> 01:21:08,125
Please get a few copies
of the conditions of their proposal

709
01:21:08,208 --> 01:21:10,375
and telegraph them to headquarters.

710
01:21:10,458 --> 01:21:11,791
You inform the government.

711
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:17,333
We have 72 hours left here, gentlemen,

712
01:21:17,416 --> 01:21:19,750
and during every minute
we waste by talking about it,

713
01:21:19,833 --> 01:21:21,291
there dies another soldier.

714
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:25,666
Let us gain mercy where we can,
but for God's sake,

715
01:21:26,500 --> 01:21:27,583
let's make peace.

716
01:22:12,916 --> 01:22:15,250
Retreat! Retreat!

717
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:22,333
Run! Run!

718
01:22:22,833 --> 01:22:25,083
Keep firing!

719
01:23:24,083 --> 01:23:25,125
Shut up!

720
01:24:09,458 --> 01:24:10,458
Shut up!

721
01:24:13,666 --> 01:24:14,791
That's enough!

722
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:11,708
No, no, no.

723
01:26:12,333 --> 01:26:13,333
Comrade.

724
01:26:14,250 --> 01:26:16,208
Comrade, comrade.

725
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:19,625
So sorry.

726
01:27:20,958 --> 01:27:22,041
So sorry.

727
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,208
I am so sorry. I am so sorry.

728
01:28:02,750 --> 01:28:05,291
DUVAL, GÉRARD
TYPOGRAPHER

729
01:28:19,916 --> 01:28:20,916
Your wife...

730
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:24,000
Your wife...

731
01:28:25,625 --> 01:28:27,291
I promise... I promise...

732
01:28:28,708 --> 01:28:29,708
I promise...

733
01:30:17,500 --> 01:30:19,125
When were you born, Brixdorf?

734
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:23,291
1877, in June.

735
01:30:25,291 --> 01:30:26,708
A summer child.

736
01:30:27,791 --> 01:30:28,791
Yes.

737
01:30:31,875 --> 01:30:33,083
What about your father?

738
01:30:35,375 --> 01:30:37,625
My family live in Holstein
and he has a factory there.

739
01:30:38,166 --> 01:30:40,541
Producing what?

740
01:30:42,416 --> 01:30:43,708
Riding saddles, general.

741
01:30:44,208 --> 01:30:45,375
Riding saddles.

742
01:30:47,083 --> 01:30:50,458
Something that will always sell.
Your future is secure then.

743
01:30:52,125 --> 01:30:53,458
I am indeed fortunate.

744
01:30:55,833 --> 01:30:56,833
And?

745
01:30:57,666 --> 01:30:59,250
Are you looking forward to going home?

746
01:31:00,541 --> 01:31:02,916
- When we are no longer needed here?
- Yes.

747
01:31:04,583 --> 01:31:07,750
After the war,
a position of responsibility awaits me.

748
01:31:08,583 --> 01:31:10,666
- I will take over the business.
- Mhm.

749
01:31:11,833 --> 01:31:12,958
Congratulations.

750
01:31:13,583 --> 01:31:14,583
And you?

751
01:31:16,916 --> 01:31:18,000
I'm a soldier.

752
01:31:19,833 --> 01:31:22,083
My father was an officer in this regiment.

753
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:25,541
He fought in the three wars
under Bismarck.

754
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:27,708
He won all three of them.

755
01:31:28,291 --> 01:31:30,583
In 1871, he marched on Paris

756
01:31:31,250 --> 01:31:33,083
and when he returned, he was a hero.

757
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:39,125
I was too late in being born, Brixdorf.

758
01:31:40,791 --> 01:31:42,750
It's been 50 years of no war.

759
01:31:44,166 --> 01:31:45,708
What is a soldier without war?

760
01:31:52,875 --> 01:31:54,500
Were you and your father close?

761
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:57,458
As a child, maybe.

762
01:31:59,708 --> 01:32:01,875
A man is alone when born.

763
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,583
He lives alone

764
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:06,208
and on his deathbed is alone.

765
01:32:36,166 --> 01:32:37,291
THE KAISER HAS ABDICATED

766
01:32:37,375 --> 01:32:39,000
Come in.

767
01:32:40,375 --> 01:32:43,500
- Von Helldorf. How can I help you?
- Hindenburg.

768
01:32:43,583 --> 01:32:44,875
Open it immediately.

769
01:32:51,416 --> 01:32:52,816
He urges us to sign.

770
01:32:56,291 --> 01:32:58,541
- It's over!
- We're going home!

771
01:32:58,625 --> 01:33:00,833
We're going home!

772
01:33:01,416 --> 01:33:03,083
Back to our families.

773
01:33:11,458 --> 01:33:15,958
In the name of all
who are living in a world of sin.

774
01:33:16,041 --> 01:33:19,666
We are surrounded by it now in the filth.

775
01:33:21,916 --> 01:33:23,250
Knock on the monastery's door

776
01:33:23,333 --> 01:33:26,500
and you'll find
only thieves and scoundrels.

777
01:33:26,583 --> 01:33:29,375
It's finally over.
The fat pigs finally get it.

778
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:33,625
They're negotiating at last.
We're going home soon, do you hear that?

779
01:33:38,333 --> 01:33:39,916
Are there any sergeants left?

780
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:51,250
Chloroform the man,
for God's sake.

781
01:34:05,541 --> 01:34:06,541
Bäumer.

782
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:08,625
Bäumer.

783
01:34:13,750 --> 01:34:14,833
Bäumer.

784
01:34:14,916 --> 01:34:16,541
Tjaden? Tjaden.

785
01:34:18,791 --> 01:34:19,791
What happened?

786
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:21,458
Where have you been hit?

787
01:34:21,541 --> 01:34:22,625
Above the knee.

788
01:34:23,875 --> 01:34:25,333
Or somewhere down there.

789
01:34:25,416 --> 01:34:26,791
I can't feel anything.

790
01:34:27,708 --> 01:34:29,291
How far up is the shot?

791
01:34:30,333 --> 01:34:31,666
I can't raise my head.

792
01:34:33,666 --> 01:34:35,125
Ten centimetres, it seems.

793
01:34:39,875 --> 01:34:41,115
You're going home soon, Tjaden.

794
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:43,125
- You think so?
- Yes, you are.

795
01:34:47,833 --> 01:34:50,166
It's unlikely the police force
will have me, though.

796
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:53,291
God damn shit.

797
01:34:54,500 --> 01:34:55,875
You can still do it.

798
01:34:58,041 --> 01:34:59,166
Just wait and see.

799
01:34:59,958 --> 01:35:01,875
I'm not going to let them amputate me.

800
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:05,250
I'm not living as a cripple in this world.

801
01:35:05,791 --> 01:35:07,041
You won't have to.

802
01:35:07,125 --> 01:35:09,445
There are others who are worse off
that they've patched up.

803
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,250
Oh, dear Paul.

804
01:35:15,958 --> 01:35:17,416
I have something to give you.

805
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,333
Is he dead?

806
01:35:56,083 --> 01:35:57,708
You must show braveness.

807
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:00,625
You're alive, remember?

808
01:36:00,708 --> 01:36:02,541
For that, you have to be grateful.

809
01:36:03,375 --> 01:36:04,375
For us.

810
01:36:04,458 --> 01:36:06,750
- For those who didn't make it.
- That's enough.

811
01:36:06,833 --> 01:36:09,333
Look here. You mustn't say that. Not you.

812
01:36:24,791 --> 01:36:26,083
Good feeling, right?

813
01:36:27,291 --> 01:36:28,375
Have a bit of that, then.

814
01:36:28,958 --> 01:36:30,666
Yeah,
dry your socks out there.

815
01:36:31,166 --> 01:36:32,846
The way the last summer was...

816
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,583
Right, none...

817
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:41,875
You see?

818
01:36:41,958 --> 01:36:43,398
Not like the last one.

819
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:46,500
That was too...

820
01:36:49,791 --> 01:36:51,583
You always blame me.

821
01:36:51,666 --> 01:36:54,500
- We saw you!
- What did you see me doing?

822
01:36:55,625 --> 01:36:56,666
Come on!

823
01:36:57,791 --> 01:36:59,166
Nah, we know it was you.

824
01:36:59,250 --> 01:37:00,875
Why is it always on me?

825
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:17,916
Do you have shit for brains?
Why won't you listen?

826
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,583
You have been given
a second company's provisions.

827
01:37:21,208 --> 01:37:23,791
We are that second company!

828
01:37:23,875 --> 01:37:25,958
So dish it out! Give it to us!

829
01:37:26,041 --> 01:37:27,041
Kat?

830
01:37:27,750 --> 01:37:28,916
- Kat!
- Paul?

831
01:37:29,000 --> 01:37:30,000
Kat!

832
01:37:30,708 --> 01:37:31,708
Paul!

833
01:37:32,208 --> 01:37:33,833
- Paul!
- Kat, you were alive.

834
01:37:33,916 --> 01:37:35,541
- Paul!
- You're alive!

835
01:37:35,625 --> 01:37:36,625
Paul.

836
01:37:44,875 --> 01:37:46,125
Tjaden was hit.

837
01:37:46,208 --> 01:37:47,500
He's lying inside the church.

838
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:50,666
He'll get a double portion from us.

839
01:37:50,750 --> 01:37:51,750
Yes.

840
01:37:56,125 --> 01:37:57,791
Another one. In here.

841
01:38:00,500 --> 01:38:03,583
- I thought you were dead.
- Ha!

842
01:38:04,541 --> 01:38:05,916
At some point, we'll all die.

843
01:38:06,958 --> 01:38:08,358
But not on the home stretch.

844
01:38:10,625 --> 01:38:12,333
If you die before me, I'll kill you.

845
01:38:13,750 --> 01:38:15,583
Ha!

846
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:19,833
Tjaden.

847
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:22,791
Tjaden.

848
01:38:26,916 --> 01:38:27,916
Yes.

849
01:38:28,541 --> 01:38:29,750
- Kat?
- Yes.

850
01:38:34,083 --> 01:38:35,833
Kat.

851
01:38:35,916 --> 01:38:37,416
I've soup here for you.

852
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:38,916
Have you brought cutlery?

853
01:38:39,000 --> 01:38:41,125
Yes, we brought cutlery as well.

854
01:38:46,500 --> 01:38:47,916
There you go. Eat up.

855
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:14,833
Stop, stop, Tjaden, Tjaden!

856
01:39:15,333 --> 01:39:16,333
Stop!

857
01:39:20,416 --> 01:39:21,625
We need help over here!

858
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:24,291
What made you do that?

859
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:25,375
Why would you?

860
01:39:26,208 --> 01:39:27,958
It's over for me.

861
01:39:28,041 --> 01:39:29,416
He's bleeding out!

862
01:39:34,375 --> 01:39:35,375
Tjaden.

863
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:41,416
Tjaden.

864
01:41:15,875 --> 01:41:16,875
What is it?

865
01:41:19,041 --> 01:41:20,125
I've lost something.

866
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,375
Kat, do you speak French?

867
01:41:27,041 --> 01:41:29,291
Mm.
<i>S'il vous plaît. S'il vous plaît.</i>

868
01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:35,666
My mother always said
it was French I should learn.

869
01:41:35,750 --> 01:41:36,625
Aha.

870
01:41:40,041 --> 01:41:41,041
And the piano.

871
01:41:43,541 --> 01:41:45,083
She also warned me of war.

872
01:41:45,583 --> 01:41:46,708
She didn't want me to go.

873
01:41:46,791 --> 01:41:49,666
"That's not for you," she always said.
"You'll be dead in no time."

874
01:41:52,083 --> 01:41:53,708
I wanted to show that I could do it.

875
01:41:54,708 --> 01:41:56,125
What use is that now?

876
01:41:59,708 --> 01:42:01,583
"A couple of weeks, we'll be in Paris."

877
01:42:04,333 --> 01:42:07,375
These past two years of grenades
can't be shed like an item of clothing.

878
01:42:07,458 --> 01:42:10,125
- Paul.
- The stench will remain on us forever.

879
01:42:10,208 --> 01:42:12,184
- Enough.
- Ludwig is dead. Franz is dead. Albert...

880
01:42:12,208 --> 01:42:13,541
Is that to do with us?

881
01:42:14,750 --> 01:42:16,333
They don't suffer any more.

882
01:42:16,833 --> 01:42:17,833
Peace for them.

883
01:42:19,958 --> 01:42:21,458
We're still alive.

884
01:42:25,875 --> 01:42:27,541
Everything here is like a fever.

885
01:42:28,291 --> 01:42:30,416
Not one person wants it
but suddenly it's there.

886
01:42:31,625 --> 01:42:33,791
We didn't ask for it.
The others didn't ask for it.

887
01:42:33,875 --> 01:42:35,083
But nonetheless it happened

888
01:42:35,166 --> 01:42:37,226
and nonetheless half the world
is involved, mind you.

889
01:42:37,250 --> 01:42:38,375
God looks down

890
01:42:39,791 --> 01:42:41,083
at us murderers.

891
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:46,500
Yeah, well.

892
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:51,375
But what do I know?

893
01:42:51,958 --> 01:42:52,958
Nothing.

894
01:42:53,666 --> 01:42:55,208
I'm a pair of boots with a rifle.

895
01:42:57,458 --> 01:42:59,416
Get some rest. We're the lucky ones.

896
01:42:59,916 --> 01:43:00,916
Yes.

897
01:43:18,791 --> 01:43:19,791
Kat?

898
01:43:20,625 --> 01:43:21,708
Mm.

899
01:43:23,833 --> 01:43:25,166
What did your son die of?

900
01:43:30,583 --> 01:43:31,583
The pox.

901
01:43:40,041 --> 01:43:41,708
I'm afraid of what's to come.

902
01:43:49,083 --> 01:43:50,083
Don't be.

903
01:44:22,208 --> 01:44:23,208
Henri.

904
01:44:26,708 --> 01:44:27,833
Taste it.

905
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:32,916
Were they made today?

906
01:44:35,916 --> 01:44:37,875
I'm sorry, sir. I don't think so.

907
01:44:38,875 --> 01:44:39,875
Hmm.

908
01:45:02,291 --> 01:45:03,458
Monsieur le Maréchal.

909
01:45:10,875 --> 01:45:12,000
I'm listening.

910
01:45:12,083 --> 01:45:14,041
The Kaiser
has abdicated.

911
01:45:14,125 --> 01:45:18,666
Soldiers are refusing to obey orders.
Deserters are roaming the countryside.

912
01:45:18,750 --> 01:45:21,250
The new government
will do everything it can

913
01:45:21,333 --> 01:45:23,875
to fulfil the duties imposed on it,

914
01:45:23,958 --> 01:45:27,708
but the population,
through no fault of its own,

915
01:45:28,375 --> 01:45:30,750
faces hunger and anarchy setting in.

916
01:45:30,833 --> 01:45:34,041
This is a disease
of the defeated, not of the victorious.

917
01:45:34,125 --> 01:45:35,500
I don't fear it.

918
01:45:35,583 --> 01:45:37,208
I reject any compromise.

919
01:45:37,291 --> 01:45:38,875
I reject any compromise.

920
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:41,041
Monsieur le Maréchal, please.

921
01:45:42,250 --> 01:45:45,500
Be fair to your opponent
or else this peace will be hated.

922
01:45:45,583 --> 01:45:46,583
Fair?

923
01:45:49,875 --> 01:45:51,458
You speak of fairness?

924
01:46:05,625 --> 01:46:06,750
Sign it.

925
01:47:11,250 --> 01:47:12,690
Let the minutes record.

926
01:47:14,291 --> 01:47:18,083
The armistice here signed
shall take effect in six hours from now

927
01:47:18,166 --> 01:47:21,916
at the eleventh hour, on the eleventh day
of the eleventh month.

928
01:47:24,375 --> 01:47:25,666
Very good.

929
01:47:26,291 --> 01:47:27,416
The war is over.

930
01:47:41,583 --> 01:47:43,623
What are you going to do now?

931
01:47:45,416 --> 01:47:47,000
What do you see here, Brixdorf?

932
01:47:49,250 --> 01:47:51,041
The plains of Latierre, general.

933
01:47:51,125 --> 01:47:52,125
Eguisac.

934
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,250
I see them too.

935
01:47:55,458 --> 01:47:58,166
But also German soldiers
running away like cowards.

936
01:48:00,041 --> 01:48:02,333
The French troops are farting
on our position in Latierre

937
01:48:02,416 --> 01:48:04,958
and outside there's a train
crammed full of horse fuckers

938
01:48:05,041 --> 01:48:06,361
who are selling the homeland off.

939
01:48:10,541 --> 01:48:12,458
See to it that all recruits are withdrawn.

940
01:48:13,750 --> 01:48:15,083
Have them all report here.

941
01:48:15,750 --> 01:48:18,291
We're going to sort out this pile of shit!

942
01:48:29,083 --> 01:48:33,416
<i>Any communication
with the enemy remains prohibited.</i>

943
01:48:33,500 --> 01:48:38,416
<i>Firstly, hostilities on the entire front
will be ceased this morning,</i>

944
01:48:38,500 --> 01:48:40,666
<i>November 11th at eleven o'clock.</i>

945
01:48:41,416 --> 01:48:44,083
<i>Secondly, the troops
will not cross the line reached</i>

946
01:48:44,166 --> 01:48:46,291
<i>on this day at this hour.</i>

947
01:48:46,375 --> 01:48:50,500
<i>The front line
shall remain unchanged past this hour.</i>

948
01:48:50,583 --> 01:48:53,625
<i>All troops are to return to their station.</i>

949
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:55,541
What time is it?

950
01:49:01,416 --> 01:49:03,416
- Why aren't you asleep?
- Listen a minute.

951
01:49:07,000 --> 01:49:08,125
It's so still.

952
01:49:10,666 --> 01:49:12,041
I must be going deaf.

953
01:49:18,416 --> 01:49:19,791
They've signed, Paul.

954
01:49:24,541 --> 01:49:25,583
The war's over.

955
01:49:27,541 --> 01:49:28,541
It's over.

956
01:49:34,250 --> 01:49:35,250
Are you hungry?

957
01:49:36,208 --> 01:49:37,375
I'm hungry.

958
01:49:42,375 --> 01:49:43,791
Where are you going?

959
01:49:43,875 --> 01:49:46,000
Come on,
before the bastard wakes up.

960
01:49:48,125 --> 01:49:51,208
- What are you doing for Christmas, Paul?
- I don't know.

961
01:49:51,291 --> 01:49:53,041
I'm gonna roast a goose.

962
01:49:53,625 --> 01:49:55,333
Red cabbage, potatoes...

963
01:49:55,416 --> 01:49:58,041
Then I'll light all the candles
and kiss my wife.

964
01:49:58,125 --> 01:50:00,750
My God, Paul, she is beautiful.

965
01:50:00,833 --> 01:50:01,875
Yeah?

966
01:50:01,958 --> 01:50:04,250
- What does she look like?
- Well...

967
01:50:04,833 --> 01:50:07,166
Long curly hair, dark.

968
01:50:07,833 --> 01:50:10,083
And she's buxom and strong.

969
01:50:10,166 --> 01:50:11,166
Yeah?

970
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:14,500
Christmas.

971
01:50:15,250 --> 01:50:16,625
It's all so far away still.

972
01:50:17,166 --> 01:50:18,916
No, it's not. It's really close.

973
01:50:22,750 --> 01:50:25,583
We want another child. Or children, Paul.

974
01:50:25,666 --> 01:50:29,125
Because what is Christmas
without children? It's nothing, really.

975
01:50:29,208 --> 01:50:30,208
Ah?

976
01:50:31,875 --> 01:50:32,875
You know when...

977
01:50:33,666 --> 01:50:35,416
Once we're back home, then we will...

978
01:50:36,125 --> 01:50:38,000
- Yeah?
- We must do something together.

979
01:50:38,750 --> 01:50:40,791
The two of us together.
Something big, yeah?

980
01:50:40,875 --> 01:50:41,875
Yeah, yeah.

981
01:50:43,791 --> 01:50:44,791
What is it?

982
01:50:45,333 --> 01:50:48,000
I'm a shoemaker, Paul. I repair shoes.

983
01:50:48,541 --> 01:50:52,083
Ah? You know how to read, write.
You finished school.

984
01:50:53,083 --> 01:50:54,363
Hasn't done me any good, though.

985
01:50:55,541 --> 01:50:56,625
What are we gonna do?

986
01:50:57,333 --> 01:50:58,750
Sole shoes together?

987
01:50:59,500 --> 01:51:00,791
Are you trying to insult me?

988
01:51:02,125 --> 01:51:03,833
I can't read my wife's letters even now.

989
01:51:05,208 --> 01:51:06,528
You're going to university, Paul.

990
01:51:07,541 --> 01:51:08,875
Or I'll shoot you right here.

991
01:51:11,333 --> 01:51:12,458
My trousers are loose.

992
01:51:15,333 --> 01:51:16,541
My trousers are loose.

993
01:51:19,000 --> 01:51:20,875
You'll just have to eat something.

994
01:51:21,791 --> 01:51:24,072
Soon we'll be home
then we can eat whatever we want.

995
01:51:25,291 --> 01:51:26,291
Whatever we want.

996
01:51:51,416 --> 01:51:52,416
It's your go.

997
01:51:53,083 --> 01:51:55,083
If the farmer catches me again,

998
01:51:55,166 --> 01:51:57,041
then he's bound
to shoot me down where I stand.

999
01:52:01,458 --> 01:52:03,291
Just be careful of the damn dog too.

1000
01:52:03,375 --> 01:52:04,375
Yeah.

1001
01:52:36,291 --> 01:52:37,291
Ah?

1002
01:52:55,708 --> 01:52:57,791
Shh, shh... Hey, hey, hey.

1003
01:53:18,208 --> 01:53:19,208
Look.

1004
01:53:22,208 --> 01:53:23,541
It's really good.

1005
01:53:26,916 --> 01:53:27,916
Want some?

1006
01:53:30,250 --> 01:53:31,250
Shit.

1007
01:54:14,000 --> 01:54:16,000
Piece of garbage...

1008
01:54:22,208 --> 01:54:23,208
Stop!

1009
01:54:24,166 --> 01:54:25,291
Thief!

1010
01:54:33,875 --> 01:54:35,500
Kat! Run!

1011
01:54:36,375 --> 01:54:37,375
Run!

1012
01:54:39,250 --> 01:54:40,250
Asshole!

1013
01:54:45,958 --> 01:54:46,958
God damn!

1014
01:54:48,041 --> 01:54:50,041
We'll kill them, these sons of bitches.

1015
01:55:07,291 --> 01:55:08,666
Oh, crap.

1016
01:55:08,750 --> 01:55:10,166
- Look at this.
- What is it?

1017
01:55:11,125 --> 01:55:13,083
- A lucky shot.
- He hit the eggs!

1018
01:55:14,958 --> 01:55:16,041
Stop the flow.

1019
01:55:21,500 --> 01:55:22,791
Come on, get it in there.

1020
01:55:23,875 --> 01:55:24,916
There you go.

1021
01:55:27,875 --> 01:55:29,208
We can have an omelette.

1022
01:55:29,291 --> 01:55:31,416
No, we'll eat them now.

1023
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:32,500
They're just as good.

1024
01:55:51,333 --> 01:55:52,416
Better than ever.

1025
01:55:54,208 --> 01:55:55,208
I won't be long.

1026
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:33,500
Kat?

1027
01:57:38,333 --> 01:57:39,500
Kat?

1028
01:57:43,875 --> 01:57:44,875
Kat!

1029
01:57:46,958 --> 01:57:48,000
What happened?

1030
01:57:48,916 --> 01:57:49,916
We should leave.

1031
01:57:51,625 --> 01:57:52,666
Who fired the shot?

1032
01:57:53,166 --> 01:57:54,541
That little shit from the farm.

1033
01:57:55,666 --> 01:57:56,833
The farmer's son.

1034
01:57:58,875 --> 01:58:00,291
Kat, Kat.

1035
01:58:01,166 --> 01:58:02,208
What a mess.

1036
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:11,333
How big is it?

1037
01:58:11,708 --> 01:58:14,000
Little finger.
I'll get the bullet out.

1038
01:58:14,083 --> 01:58:16,333
No. Give me a cigarette.

1039
01:58:17,541 --> 01:58:18,708
Let the medic do that.

1040
01:58:37,125 --> 01:58:39,208
They stuck me in a class
with seven-year-olds.

1041
01:58:41,125 --> 01:58:42,750
I'd begun shaving already.

1042
01:58:44,458 --> 01:58:45,541
Find me a word.

1043
01:58:47,666 --> 01:58:49,208
That trifle can rhyme with.

1044
01:58:50,375 --> 01:58:51,375
Mhm.

1045
01:58:53,291 --> 01:58:55,583
Nothing rhymes with trifle. Nothing.

1046
01:59:02,166 --> 01:59:03,541
Fucking shit.

1047
01:59:04,958 --> 01:59:07,083
Why the hell did this have to happen now?

1048
01:59:10,916 --> 01:59:12,541
- Come on, we need to move.
- Yeah.

1049
01:59:19,708 --> 01:59:20,708
Alright?

1050
01:59:21,666 --> 01:59:22,875
Kat?

1051
01:59:22,958 --> 01:59:24,083
Rifle.

1052
01:59:24,166 --> 01:59:25,333
Mhm?

1053
01:59:25,416 --> 01:59:27,125
Rifle rhymes with trifle.

1054
01:59:37,083 --> 01:59:40,791
When we get home, you're going
to make a new pair of boots for me.

1055
01:59:40,875 --> 01:59:42,708
I'm walking my feet to the bone.

1056
01:59:57,291 --> 01:59:58,291
Hey!

1057
02:00:01,625 --> 02:00:02,750
Wait!

1058
02:00:04,333 --> 02:00:05,333
Pull over!

1059
02:00:05,875 --> 02:00:06,875
Let us on!

1060
02:00:07,916 --> 02:00:09,541
Hey! Let us on!

1061
02:00:20,666 --> 02:00:21,750
Come on, will you?

1062
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,375
This man needs care.

1063
02:01:00,750 --> 02:01:01,916
Where is the medic?

1064
02:01:31,000 --> 02:01:32,760
Could've spared yourself
the trouble.

1065
02:01:33,875 --> 02:01:34,875
Huh?

1066
02:01:35,750 --> 02:01:36,750
He's dead.

1067
02:01:42,166 --> 02:01:44,541
But it's... It's just a small bullet wound.

1068
02:01:45,166 --> 02:01:47,833
Yes, black blood. Straight into the liver.

1069
02:01:48,375 --> 02:01:49,458
The organs are poisoned.

1070
02:01:56,416 --> 02:01:57,416
Unconscious.

1071
02:01:58,541 --> 02:01:59,541
No.

1072
02:02:00,000 --> 02:02:01,000
He's dead.

1073
02:02:01,500 --> 02:02:02,625
I know what I'm doing.

1074
02:02:05,000 --> 02:02:07,791
Impossible. I was...
I was just talking to him.

1075
02:02:08,375 --> 02:02:09,500
He's unconscious.

1076
02:02:11,375 --> 02:02:12,458
He's unconscious.

1077
02:02:19,875 --> 02:02:20,875
See?

1078
02:02:22,625 --> 02:02:25,416
He simply had bad luck.
Right before the end.

1079
02:04:14,125 --> 02:04:15,750
Go on, keep going!

1080
02:04:15,833 --> 02:04:17,208
Keep going!

1081
02:04:17,708 --> 02:04:19,333
Keep going, come on!

1082
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:29,083
This is it.

1083
02:04:31,250 --> 02:04:32,750
I'm going to tell him I'm going home.

1084
02:04:34,708 --> 02:04:35,708
It's over.

1085
02:04:37,541 --> 02:04:39,208
Attention!

1086
02:04:45,416 --> 02:04:46,416
Soldiers.

1087
02:04:47,000 --> 02:04:49,166
We stand here as brothers

1088
02:04:50,125 --> 02:04:51,833
in a world of enemies

1089
02:04:51,916 --> 02:04:54,833
and are forced to watch
as German social democrats

1090
02:04:54,916 --> 02:04:57,875
render our beloved people defenseless

1091
02:04:59,166 --> 02:05:02,083
by accepting a perfidious armistice.

1092
02:05:04,125 --> 02:05:05,125
Comrades.

1093
02:05:06,083 --> 02:05:07,916
Soon you will be going home

1094
02:05:08,000 --> 02:05:10,416
to your parents, wives and children.

1095
02:05:11,375 --> 02:05:12,541
The war is over.

1096
02:05:13,250 --> 02:05:18,083
After years of sacrifice and suffering,
you can now look forward to your reward.

1097
02:05:18,750 --> 02:05:22,916
To the reward of admiration
for all you have achieved here.

1098
02:05:24,416 --> 02:05:26,000
Ah, but comrades,

1099
02:05:27,416 --> 02:05:30,250
do you want to be welcomed
as soldiers and heroes on your return

1100
02:05:32,291 --> 02:05:33,166
or as weaklings

1101
02:05:33,250 --> 02:05:36,416
and cowards who tucked their tails in
when it really counted?

1102
02:05:36,500 --> 02:05:37,580
We're going home.

1103
02:05:37,625 --> 02:05:38,625
Soldiers.

1104
02:05:39,333 --> 02:05:43,250
We are about to attack them
with the utmost force and vehemence.

1105
02:05:43,958 --> 02:05:47,500
Latierre belongs in German hands.

1106
02:05:47,583 --> 02:05:52,541
We will seize the plains before 11:00 a.m.
and end this war with a merciless strike.

1107
02:05:52,625 --> 02:05:53,958
and make them see...

1108
02:05:55,000 --> 02:05:56,500
...we were victorious.

1109
02:05:56,583 --> 02:06:01,583
Onwards, with God on our side
as he was with our fathers before us.

1110
02:06:01,666 --> 02:06:04,333
I'm not going back
into battle. Not me!

1111
02:06:04,416 --> 02:06:05,583
Shut up!

1112
02:06:06,875 --> 02:06:09,333
- Let me go!
- Follow your orders!

1113
02:06:09,416 --> 02:06:11,267
Do as your told!

1114
02:06:11,291 --> 02:06:12,375
All of you, get back.

1115
02:06:13,083 --> 02:06:15,517
- Please, I didn't do anything!
- Aim!

1116
02:06:15,541 --> 02:06:18,291
- No! No!
- Fire!

1117
02:06:42,583 --> 02:06:43,791
Keep moving!

1118
02:06:46,666 --> 02:06:47,666
Come on!

1119
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:57,666
Company, halt!

1120
02:07:01,958 --> 02:07:04,125
Rifle off!

1121
02:07:04,208 --> 02:07:07,375
- Fix bayonets!
- Fix bayonets and load!

1122
02:07:22,416 --> 02:07:23,875
What time is it?

1123
02:07:23,958 --> 02:07:25,291
Fifteen minutes to go.

1124
02:08:02,625 --> 02:08:04,025
It belonged to Lefèvre.

1125
02:08:05,291 --> 02:08:07,083
Poor bastard, he saved it for the end.

1126
02:08:07,791 --> 02:08:10,083
- He won't need it anymore.
- Thank you, sir.

1127
02:08:14,375 --> 02:08:16,208
Here's to you and to Lefèvre.

1128
02:08:22,541 --> 02:08:23,583
Well, it's good.

1129
02:08:27,208 --> 02:08:28,208
The nightmare is over.

1130
02:09:28,375 --> 02:09:31,333
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!

1131
02:09:31,416 --> 02:09:33,083
- In position!
- In position!

1132
02:09:35,666 --> 02:09:37,083
Fire!

1133
02:09:37,958 --> 02:09:39,166
Fire!

1134
02:10:14,375 --> 02:10:16,083
Throw the grenades!

1135
02:10:26,791 --> 02:10:27,958
Charge!

1136
02:11:24,208 --> 02:11:26,125
Please, no! No, no!

1137
02:13:16,625 --> 02:13:18,333
Cease fire!

1138
02:13:18,416 --> 02:13:19,958
It is 11:00 a.m.!

1139
02:13:20,625 --> 02:13:22,065
Cease fire!

1140
02:13:22,541 --> 02:13:24,541
Cease fire!

1141
02:13:25,541 --> 02:13:27,625
It is eleven o'clock.

1142
02:16:02,708 --> 02:16:05,583
A light!
Bring me a light! A light please!

1143
02:16:24,875 --> 02:16:26,515
Are you alright?

1144
02:16:27,875 --> 02:16:28,875
Yeah.

1145
02:16:29,666 --> 02:16:32,125
Well, then.
Start gathering, please.

1146
02:19:53,458 --> 02:19:57,041
Shortly after the start of hostilities
in October 1914,

1147
02:19:57,125 --> 02:19:59,958
the Western Front
froze into positional warfare.

1148
02:20:01,458 --> 02:20:07,750
By the end of the war in November 1918,
the front line had barely moved.

1149
02:20:09,416 --> 02:20:12,125
More than three million soldiers
died here,

1150
02:20:12,208 --> 02:20:15,791
often while fighting to gain
only a few hundred meters of ground.

1151
02:20:17,375 --> 02:20:23,708
Almost 17 million people
lost their lives in the First World War.

1152
02:20:25,875 --> 02:20:32,416
ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT
