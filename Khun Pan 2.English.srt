00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:11,400
THIS FILM IS INSPIRED BY A TRUE STORY

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,759
CHARACTERS, LOCALES
AND INCIDENTS ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:16,320
AND HAVE BEEN CREATED FOR
THE SOLE PURPOSE OF ENTERTAINMENT

4
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,159
LORD BUDDHA ONCE SAID
TO MAUDGALYAYANA,

5
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,719
"THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF MIRACLES.

6
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:39,320
ANUSASANI, MIRACLES OF TEACHING,

7
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:41,759
AND ITHIRIDDHI,
MIRACLES OF MAGIC AND SUPERPOWERS."

8
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:42,960
BUDDHA ENDORSED THE FORMER,

9
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:44,840
BUT DIDN'T REJECT THE EXISTENCE
OF THE LATTER.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,560
In 1945, World War II was about to end.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:54,920
The country was bruised and battered.

12
00:00:55,439 --> 00:01:00,159
Desperate people took up arms
and became bandits.

13
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,240
They robbed and killed the rich,

14
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,120
giving some back to the poor.

15
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,840
They were called the Blackshirt Bandits.

16
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:14,760
That year, I was sent to head
the Chai Nat Police Department.

17
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,760
NONG MAMONG, CHAI NAT PROVINCE

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,719
Sir, these Chinese hoodlums
must be from Suphan.

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,920
Members of Jek Ma's gang.

20
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,799
They must have stepped on the toes
of Bandit Fai,

21
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:30,200
and fled here to cause more trouble.

22
00:01:31,239 --> 00:01:33,680
I heard this Jek Ma practices black magic.

23
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,400
He can make himself invisible.

24
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,640
Radio the district chiefs.

25
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,280
Chief!

26
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,000
Khun Pan has ordered an attack.

27
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,840
He thinks he's the boss?

28
00:01:52,359 --> 00:01:53,280
Eat first.

29
00:01:57,159 --> 00:01:58,000
Sir!

30
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:24,599
Sit tight.

31
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,520
Get down!

32
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,280
-I'm out of here.
-Get down!

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,639
Shoot!

34
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:47,840
Stop!

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,319
Kill him!

36
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,680
Go get him.

37
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,400
Don't let him get away.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,479
Follow him. Kill him!

39
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,520
There!

40
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,599
Get him!

41
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,520
Protect me through the power
of Namo Buddhaya.

42
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,919
Protect me through the power
of Namo Buddhaya.

43
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,360
Susing susang arahang bhagava.

44
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,319
Chief!

45
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,839
-All dead?
-Except the women and children.

46
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,000
Good. Let's go.

47
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,120
Sons of crooks will grow up to be crooks.

48
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,639
We can't let them live.

49
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,279
Look, we're rich!

50
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,079
I'll take you alive
if you turn yourself in.

51
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,439
I don't think so, sir.

52
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:14,319
You know how the war has made us all poor.

53
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:19,120
Government servants like us
can't make ends meet.

54
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,199
What we impound from the thieves
goes to state coffers.

55
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:25,879
We risk our lives
and get nothing in return.

56
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,000
Am I right?

57
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,439
We...

58
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:05,279
pledge our loyalty to the nation

59
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,600
and to the people.

60
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:11,160
Being law enforcement officers

61
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,279
means you have to follow the rules

62
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,560
of law and justice.

63
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:19,600
You have to be ready to wage war
on all kinds of crimes,

64
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,319
and uphold the dignity
of the Royal Thai Police.

65
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,600
Sorcery is all about arming your mind.

66
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,360
To learn this art,

67
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,600
you must first free your mind.

68
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,559
Find samadhi,

69
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:51,840
and concentrate on your faith.

70
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,720
Remember,

71
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,320
what you believe
defines what you see and hear.

72
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,240
A great rock

73
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,759
is made of tiny grains of sand.

74
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:18,039
Its strength is transient
and it will soon return to nature.

75
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:26,120
Birth and death are parts of a cycle,
and what remains is energy.

76
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,559
To control this energy
is to define what you hear and see.

77
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,320
Namo tassa bhagavato arahato...

78
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:13,200
The magic formula.

79
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:19,919
Focus your mind on your enemy.
See the bullet coming at you.

80
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,399
Buddhang. Protect the skin.

81
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,120
Dhammang. The flesh. Sanghang. The bones.

82
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:30,639
Ohm. I'm indestructible.

83
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,600
Buddhang. Protect the skin.

84
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:03,960
Dhammang. The flesh.

85
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,120
Sanghang. The bones.

86
00:11:07,799 --> 00:11:11,039
Ohm. I'm indestructible.

87
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,679
Use this power to protect others.

88
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:07,000
You know, Khun Pan
actually wanted us on that mission.

89
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,960
Luckily, we were off duty,

90
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,240
or we could've been in those coffins.

91
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,879
Khun Pan is invincible,
but his men aren't.

92
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,799
He always returns safely
while everyone else is dead.

93
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,000
Excuse me, ma'am.

94
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,919
Your husband was a brave policeman.

95
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,759
You should be proud of him.

96
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,039
He had such faith in you.

97
00:13:07,679 --> 00:13:11,759
He told me that if you ordered him to die,

98
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,000
he would go and die.

99
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,480
Maybe you should be proud of that.

100
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,480
Excuse me.

101
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:38,559
I'm from
the Office of the Inspector General.

102
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,399
You're under investigation.

103
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:45,320
Pol. Maj. Gen. Khun Pan,

104
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,840
chief of the Chai Nat Police Department,

105
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,480
has committed excessive
and intemperate acts,

106
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:58,080
resulting in several deaths
of the officers under his command.

107
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:03,960
The extrajudicial killing of Chief Yun
was above his authority.

108
00:14:05,039 --> 00:14:06,960
The Royal Thai Police rules that

109
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Khun Pan is guilty of serious misconduct.

110
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:16,519
Therefore, the punishment is
his dismissal from the force.

111
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:20,080
However, since he has a record

112
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:23,559
of commendable service,

113
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:27,960
he will be suspended from duty
for an indefinite period.

114
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,440
Effective immediately.

115
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,360
SUSPENDED

116
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,159
PROVINCIAL POLICE REGION 1

117
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:46,159
Newspapers! The war is almost over!

118
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,639
-Who is he?
-That's the bad guy.

119
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,080
-He looks like a bandit.
-Your coffee.

120
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,559
Your coffee, sir. There you go.

121
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,559
HAPPY RETIREMENT, SERGEANT LAEM

122
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,200
Hey, will you go anywhere tonight?

123
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:03,600
-Come to the fair tonight.
-Yes, sir.

124
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,240
Bike safely.

125
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,279
-It's been a long time, hey
-Hey

126
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,240
-It's been a long time
-It'd be good if I could fuck you

127
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,600
Hey, Inn?

128
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,200
Give me those.

129
00:15:22,679 --> 00:15:25,840
Right. Come. Your target.

130
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,919
Sir,
does the invisibility spell really exist?

131
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,519
Can you teach me?

132
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,120
I want to hide money from my wife.
Must be useful on payday.

133
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,879
Sergeant Laem,
have you ever misplaced a key?

134
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,360
Do you think the key is really lost,
or you just can't see it?

135
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,840
The invisibility spell works like that.

136
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:53,240
News of the hour.

137
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,519
The Blackshirt Bandits have robbed
opium dens in the central plains,

138
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,320
causing huge losses
to the concessionaires.

139
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,600
Now they've gone into hiding.

140
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,879
The police still have no clue
where to find them.

141
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:12,399
These bandits
think of themselves as tigers.

142
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,399
Have you ever heard these names?

143
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,879
Tiger Yom, Tiger Fai,
Tiger Mahesuan, Tiger Bai.

144
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:28,039
They're skilled in fighting
with black magic and tattoos.

145
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,600
They know which palms to grease.
Policemen like us can't do a thing.

146
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,720
Hello there!

147
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,559
What's that noise?

148
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:58,679
Firecrackers?

149
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,400
Hi, handsome.

150
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,680
Help! Run!

151
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,640
Yod. Hey!

152
00:17:36,279 --> 00:17:38,480
-Yod.
-Move!

153
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,960
No.

154
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,039
The murders of our police officers

155
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,839
are an outrageous insult to the law.

156
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:33,559
I promise I'll do everything
within legal bounds

157
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,440
to bring the murderers to justice.

158
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,839
Eyewitnesses said the gunmen wore black
and covered their faces.

159
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:44,319
-Are they Bandit Fai's Blackshirt gang?
-Stop right there!

160
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,960
We couldn't make any arrest
without more evidence.

161
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,000
-Don't ask me that again.
-Deputy, sir!

162
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,200
Go ahead.

163
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:56,839
It's humiliating for the police
to be ambushed on their own turf.

164
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,480
Will that undermine
people's confidence in the force?

165
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,119
I'm a policeman.

166
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,680
I don't care about that.
My job is to put bad guys in jail.

167
00:20:04,759 --> 00:20:07,960
-Deputy Padet, do you have...
-That'll be all.

168
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,480
-Deputy.
-Deputy.

169
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,960
What's your plan

170
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,240
-for catching evil bandits?
-Will you be able to catch them?

171
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:16,720
Is it true that Bandit Fai is behind this?

172
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,960
It's strange
that they only targeted these guys.

173
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,039
What do you mean?

174
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,960
I found the victims' photos

175
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:30,000
on the guys you killed.

176
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,279
EVIDENCE NO.1
PHOTO OF SERGEANT LAEM

177
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:38,039
And they
were just low-level police clerks.

178
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,000
More like accountants.

179
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,480
Why did the Blackshirts have to take out
these unimportant men?

180
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:53,359
How well do you know these bandits?

181
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:00,519
Very well.
I was a doctor in Suphan before.

182
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:03,839
Bandit Fai

183
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,039
asked me to treat his men a few times.

184
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,359
There are two powerful men in Suphan.

185
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,079
One is a commissioner.

186
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,119
Governor Thammarong is one.

187
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,880
The other is Bandit Fai,

188
00:21:19,559 --> 00:21:21,920
or General Fai.

189
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:25,480
All the top thugs
in the central plains are with him.

190
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:29,119
But among them,

191
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:33,200
Bandit Fai trusts Bandit Bai the most.

192
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,359
When a criminal wants to join the gang,

193
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,799
he has to put his name in a record book

194
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:46,200
which will be approved by Bandit Bai
and Bandit Fai.

195
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,640
Bai is the leader
of a local anti-Japanese movement.

196
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:54,480
They rob the Japanese and merchants
who cheat the villagers.

197
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,279
They steal from the rich
and give to the poor.

198
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,680
That's why the villagers cover for them.

199
00:22:04,039 --> 00:22:07,119
In short,
people have no faith in the police,

200
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,079
and instead look up to the bandits.

201
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,079
PROVINCIAL POLICE REGION 1

202
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,880
Those police clerks
took bribes from the bandits.

203
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,319
Perhaps...

204
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,160
they asked for more,

205
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:26,440
or broke the deal with them.

206
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,720
So, the gang sent hit men to whack them.

207
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,240
They were a disgrace

208
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,960
to the police force.

209
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:41,519
Deputy Padet,
do you think Bandit Fai's Blackshirts

210
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,400
are behind this?

211
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:49,359
Anyone can wear a black shirt.

212
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,880
Fai may or may not be involved.

213
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:57,119
Anyway,

214
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:00,519
I'm glad to see your concern.

215
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,279
Don't worry,

216
00:23:04,079 --> 00:23:06,839
I'll wage an all-out war
against these criminals.

217
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:09,839
You have been suspended...

218
00:23:11,119 --> 00:23:13,000
so I don't think I can ask you to help.

219
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,880
The train carrying weapons and supplies
for the Japanese

220
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:54,480
will go to Kanchanaburi by way
of Bang Pla Ma at 4:00 p.m.,

221
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,200
every couple days.

222
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,680
But the next train will be the last one.

223
00:23:59,359 --> 00:24:02,440
Last week, I was told to clear the tracks
all the way through.

224
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,480
Because this train won't make any stops
along the way.

225
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,279
Make sure it's all right.

226
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,519
-It's OK.
-Yes, sir.

227
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:39,400
ALY 2420

228
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,400
-Make sure it's all right.
-Yes, sir.

229
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:53,440
We've been robbed! Go find it! Go!

230
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,039
-Hey!
-Bia!

231
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,680
We're fucked, man.

232
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:33,160
Prepare to fire!

233
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,359
What the fuck are you doing?

234
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,200
Stop it.

235
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,960
-Son of a bitch.
-Sir, all stolen weapons are here.

236
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,000
Good.

237
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:09,279
-Assholes!
-Let me go!

238
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:19,799
-Assholes! I've told you.
-Let me go!

239
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,680
-Scumbags! Assholes!
-Let me go!

240
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:31,079
Namo Buddhaya.

241
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,440
-Don't do it, Jap!
-Namo Buddhaya Yadha Budmona.

242
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:43,680
Don't do it, Jap! Don't do it!

243
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:46,160
Yadha Budmona
Namo Buddhaya Yadha Budmona.

244
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,039
Yadha Budmona...

245
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,880
Careful!

246
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,680
-Drop your weapons!
-Don't move.

247
00:28:16,319 --> 00:28:19,240
No, it's nothing.

248
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,200
Kill them all.

249
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,119
-What are you doing!
-It's not me! I can't control myself!

250
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:39,240
My arms just move.
They move by themselves!

251
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,440
-No!
-I didn't do it.

252
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,480
Namo Buddhaya.

253
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,759
Bai!

254
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,480
Boss.

255
00:29:39,799 --> 00:29:42,200
-Boss Fai.
-Bring their bodies back for a funeral.

256
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,039
Yes, boss.

257
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:50,960
What's the matter?

258
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:54,160
Nothing. Let's go.

259
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,839
Kamma, where's Mahesuan?

260
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:13,440
He can't make it. But he told us

261
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,440
-to follow your orders from now on.
-Fai.

262
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,599
Suphan is your territory.

263
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,759
Now you've got Bai and Mahesuan under you.

264
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,920
That means Suphan, Sing Buri and Ang Thong

265
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:31,680
are all yours.

266
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,680
Bro. I think...

267
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,640
you're becoming too big for your own good.

268
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:40,559
The more powerful you are,

269
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,000
the more attention you'll attract.

270
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:47,480
Your Chai Nat gang
has quite a large headcount.

271
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,240
If you join us, we'll become untouchable.

272
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:53,480
The authorities won't dare mess with us.

273
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:55,039
Trust me,

274
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,599
we should stick together.

275
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,200
Cheers.

276
00:31:05,319 --> 00:31:06,200
Boss Fai,

277
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,000
the Chai Nat gang may have lots of tigers,

278
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:12,200
but their guns are all rusty,

279
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:15,640
Yom, I'll let you use mine.

280
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,880
You wanna test me?

281
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,599
To see if my gun's all rusty?

282
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,279
I just want to know

283
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:36,680
if it's true that Tiger Yom
is the fastest draw in Chai Nat.

284
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:40,079
Enough! If you don't want to join me,

285
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,759
I won't force you.

286
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,480
Just stick to our own turf then.

287
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:48,920
But if I ever hear
that you've stepped on my toes

288
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,640
here in Suphan,

289
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,599
we're not going to be drinking buddies
like this again.

290
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,960
Let's go.

291
00:32:11,559 --> 00:32:14,759
-Drink up.
-Have some.

292
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:16,000
Thanks, Bai.

293
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,240
I'm Captain Asawin Petchsiri

294
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:24,359
from the
Department of Special Investigation.

295
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,319
I studied special warfare

296
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,279
and territory defense in the US.

297
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,119
I fought with the Free Thai Movement
during the war, sir.

298
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,640
Tell me.

299
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,880
They say the bandits have magic.
How do you plan to catch them?

300
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,480
I was trained to believe in science,
psychology,

301
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,400
military strategy and political warfare.

302
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,640
I do not believe in fairy tales, sir.

303
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,680
Good. I'll promote you
as the new police chief of Suphan.

304
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,200
Do not disappoint me.

305
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:55,279
Sir!

306
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,039
SUPHAN BURI PROVINCE

307
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,720
Could you tell me...

308
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,559
where the temple is
that's hosting a merit-making ceremony?

309
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:10,480
Go this way. Cross the canal.

310
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,519
You'll see the temple
with lots of policemen.

311
00:33:15,759 --> 00:33:18,519
Life and death

312
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:24,039
Are like a theater

313
00:33:24,119 --> 00:33:29,119
Have to die, inescapably

314
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,799
Like the end of a drama

315
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,559
Life is like a drama...

316
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,599
Well, well...

317
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,960
You came to apologize to me at a ceremony?

318
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,119
Where the hell is he?

319
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,200
Suramerayamajja Pama,
can you say a prayer?

320
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,840
You all go and pray
at the shrine by the river.

321
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,599
I'll see you there.

322
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,400
Bai.

323
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:20,440
See you again, love bandit.

324
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:42,039
You never change...

325
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,719
My friend, the war is over.

326
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,400
The Japanese were kicked out.

327
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,360
The Free Thai Movement
has come into the open.

328
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:58,400
Those who still love this country
should now turn to politics.

329
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,800
I'd like to ask you

330
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,639
to join my party.

331
00:35:04,719 --> 00:35:05,880
Are you in?

332
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,599
You and I...

333
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,679
have different ideologies.

334
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,880
We've chosen different paths.

335
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,559
Which is right and which is wrong,
we'll soon know.

336
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:32,599
-Tigers!
-Attack!

337
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:41,079
We mean no harm.

338
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,840
Don't try to fight.

339
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:47,920
Who's in there?

340
00:35:49,559 --> 00:35:52,719
Open it! Open!

341
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,920
Sadhu.

342
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,159
May you have a long life. Sadhu.

343
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,239
Suramerayamajja pamadatthana
veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami.

344
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,920
Lock him down.

345
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,679
Found it?

346
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,920
Bai. Found it!

347
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:40,159
TITLE DEEDS

348
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,559
Return these title deeds to the villagers.

349
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,400
-Hey! Police!
-Retreat!

350
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,360
Follow them!

351
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,840
Stay here.

352
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:38,800
Who's it?

353
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:08,280
Bai, use the magic bullet.

354
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,400
I can't until I've seen him.

355
00:38:29,039 --> 00:38:31,360
Damn!

356
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,119
Dead. He's dead.

357
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,400
Thought you could mess with us!

358
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:41,880
Tigers, retreat.

359
00:38:43,559 --> 00:38:44,840
Retreat!

360
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,800
Suramerayamajja pamadatthana
veramani sikkhapadam samadiyami.

361
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,559
Help! The bandits are raiding
the governor's house!

362
00:39:07,519 --> 00:39:10,360
Help! The bandits are raiding
the governor's house!

363
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:15,440
-Go!
-Let's go!

364
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,559
Doctor,

365
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:31,800
I have a question.

366
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:36,559
You told me Bandit Fai
used to ask you to treat his men.

367
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:39,880
How did you contact them?

368
00:39:40,199 --> 00:39:41,639
There are two ways.

369
00:39:41,719 --> 00:39:44,719
The first is to go through Bandit Bai.

370
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:50,519
Go to the temple by the river
in Bang Pla Ma.

371
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,280
He goes there every full moon night
to sell stolen Japanese weapons.

372
00:39:55,360 --> 00:40:00,400
Japanese rifles. Cheap and good!

373
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,840
-Come take a look!
-Show me the Japanese stuff.

374
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,840
Here.

375
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,719
If you want to fight Tiger Fai,

376
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,480
these are for you.

377
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:15,280
Bang! He got down, he got up.
You fire again! Bang!

378
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,400
His flesh is impenetrable,
but his insides will be bruised to death.

379
00:40:20,559 --> 00:40:21,800
Feels just right.

380
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,800
I'll take it.

381
00:40:25,039 --> 00:40:26,280
Everything you have.

382
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,960
How much?

383
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:33,519
Five rifles and a crate of ammo.

384
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,559
Twenty-thousand baht.

385
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,719
I was just joking!

386
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,840
-Twenty-thousand?
-No, 30,000.

387
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,760
-Inflation.
-Asshole.

388
00:40:53,519 --> 00:40:54,840
Second,

389
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,320
Bandit Fai will make contact

390
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,480
if he wants to see you.

391
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:02,880
He'll go through the woman called...

392
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,079
Busara.

393
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:09,000
She runs Suphan's famous tavern,
The Golden Flower.

394
00:41:09,079 --> 00:41:11,840
She's the one who knows all the secrets.

395
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:24,800
If you see him pass by

396
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,320
On horseback, on the fly

397
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:32,159
Don't look into his eyes

398
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,920
If you see him pass by

399
00:41:36,679 --> 00:41:39,840
His clothes as black as night

400
00:41:40,239 --> 00:41:43,480
His eyes as furious as fire

401
00:41:43,559 --> 00:41:47,360
If you steal something or if you lie

402
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,239
Be careful, he'll come and say hi

403
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,360
Because you know only his name

404
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:59,159
Don't even know what he rides to come

405
00:41:59,239 --> 00:42:05,639
Go try to report and you will realize

406
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,360
Not tiger but a cat...

407
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,519
That man is a thorn in my side.

408
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:29,039
Take him out.

409
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,519
Just name your price.

410
00:42:57,679 --> 00:43:01,880
I'll pay you double, Busara.

411
00:43:02,239 --> 00:43:05,039
If your intel is useful.

412
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:10,920
Triple.

413
00:43:12,559 --> 00:43:16,880
This intel is really useful to you.

414
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:24,920
Tell me.

415
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:33,159
Boss Lhong is sending someone
to whack you.

416
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,880
Let me be frank.

417
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:25,079
What brings you to Suphan?

418
00:44:26,679 --> 00:44:29,880
I'll hazard a guess...

419
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:32,960
You don't look like a salesman.

420
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,159
You're neither a civil servant

421
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,519
nor a criminal.

422
00:44:46,199 --> 00:44:47,679
The Golden Flower

423
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:49,960
is famed for our booze

424
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,880
our girls,

425
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,719
and our trove of information.

426
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,639
I bet you're looking for the latter.

427
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,840
Good evening, officers.

428
00:45:20,639 --> 00:45:21,719
How could you tell?

429
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:27,519
Our regulars don't have a taste
for such shiny leather shoes.

430
00:45:32,719 --> 00:45:35,440
More drinks? On the house.

431
00:45:40,119 --> 00:45:42,039
Have a good evening then.

432
00:45:54,119 --> 00:45:55,400
I've seen you before.

433
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,880
Have you been following me?

434
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,360
Hey!

435
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:05,599
Come here!

436
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,039
This is my table!

437
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:11,760
Get these two puppies out!

438
00:46:16,519 --> 00:46:17,599
Who are you?

439
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:19,960
Why have you followed me?

440
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:23,719
Hey! You don't know who I am?

441
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,960
Ouch! It hurts!

442
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:34,960
Good shot.

443
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,639
Now tell me,

444
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:39,840
who you are.

445
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,840
I'm the person who saved you
from the Japs at the ruins.

446
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,840
My name's Butr.

447
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,400
I was on the run to Kanchanaburi.

448
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:00,920
The cops accused me

449
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,239
of being a bandit.

450
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,599
They killed my wife.

451
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:10,119
So, I killed them at the police station

452
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:12,199
and ran here.

453
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:18,400
My plan is to find myself a good gun

454
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:21,719
and offer my service to Tiger Fai

455
00:47:23,039 --> 00:47:24,199
and Tiger Bai.

456
00:47:32,639 --> 00:47:33,920
The more the merrier.

457
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,239
Are you Bai?

458
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:44,599
I heard you're a hotshot.

459
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,280
My name's Asawin, the new police chief.

460
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,599
May I interrupt?

461
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:55,199
Mr. New Police Chief,

462
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:00,400
As you may know,

463
00:48:00,679 --> 00:48:02,239
here at The Golden Flower,

464
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,760
the good, the bad,

465
00:48:06,639 --> 00:48:09,039
the ugly, and the police

466
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:12,239
have equal rights to enjoy themselves.

467
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,199
If you're going to make an arrest,

468
00:48:15,519 --> 00:48:17,440
show me your warrant.

469
00:48:21,679 --> 00:48:23,079
If you don't have one,

470
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:25,280
then talk to my lawyer.

471
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,280
I'm not arresting anyone today.

472
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:35,000
But don't play me for a fool.

473
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:43,679
One mistake...
and I'll throw you all in jail.

474
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,840
A police chief? Looks like a puppy to me.

475
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:09,719
Hey.

476
00:49:11,039 --> 00:49:15,719
My dear customers...To make up
for the slight disturbance tonight,

477
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,239
your next drinks are on the house.

478
00:49:19,559 --> 00:49:21,440
Let's have fun.

479
00:49:21,519 --> 00:49:25,159
Yay. Woo-hoo!

480
00:49:25,239 --> 00:49:26,840
Bring more whiskey!

481
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,679
Butr, right?

482
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:35,960
You know the golden rule of banditry?

483
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:38,599
Trust no one.

484
00:49:40,639 --> 00:49:45,960
And if someone you happen to trust
betrays you...

485
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,559
You know how it'll end, right?

486
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,079
Tubtim! You're drunk!

487
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:04,760
Boss Meng, excuse us.
Enough. Come with me.

488
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:07,079
-Enough. Let's go.
-Bai!

489
00:50:07,159 --> 00:50:09,920
-See you around. Go.
-Bye.

490
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,119
Watch your step.

491
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,599
-I don't want to...
-Sleep now.

492
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:21,000
-No.
-Go to sleep.

493
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,639
Thanks, Tubtim.

494
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,400
This is the only place...

495
00:50:45,519 --> 00:50:47,039
I can sleep in peace.

496
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:05,320
Bai.

497
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,599
Kill them all.

498
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:16,760
I can't control myself! My arms just move.

499
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:18,800
-A ghost!
-I didn't do it!

500
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,320
Everyone calls me Tiger Fai.
You want to be a tiger too?

501
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,400
Yes, sir.

502
00:51:41,079 --> 00:51:43,079
If Bai hadn't vouched for you,

503
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,440
I wouldn't have taken you in.

504
00:52:24,719 --> 00:52:26,480
Ayutthaya perforated amulet...

505
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,960
Impressive stuff you've got there.

506
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,480
-The Blackshirts are coming!
-Go.

507
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,199
Let's hide!

508
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:40,679
Hide! The Blackshirts are on the way!

509
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:02,679
Good morning, folks!
The Blackshirts are here!

510
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:06,280
Take your valuable belongings out.
Hurry up!

511
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:11,159
THE BLACKSHIRTS WREAK HAVOC
ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS

512
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,519
SING BURI

513
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,480
Is it true that the police are intimidated
by the bandits in the central plains?

514
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:34,920
What kind of police are scared of robbers?

515
00:53:35,239 --> 00:53:37,719
Tigers, attack!

516
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:46,519
Tigers or monkeys,
they're all worthless to me.

517
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,119
I'll put them all behind bars.

518
00:53:49,199 --> 00:53:50,440
BANDIT FAI AND GANG WANTED DEAD

519
00:53:50,519 --> 00:53:54,079
Please help the poor!

520
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,000
-Please.
-Go buy some food.

521
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:01,079
God bless.

522
00:54:04,519 --> 00:54:08,119
You're so cheap! Robbing poor villagers!

523
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:10,920
Their clothes are ridiculous.

524
00:54:13,199 --> 00:54:15,159
Change them.

525
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:16,679
Yes, sir.

526
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,159
Nice.

527
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,679
TOP COP ASAWIN
DECLARES WAR ON THE BLACKSHIRTS

528
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:41,199
Let the sacred water be the witness.

529
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:44,039
Now we're sworn brothers.

530
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:46,320
We share money.

531
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:48,320
We share gold.

532
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:51,000
We share happiness.

533
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:53,199
In joy and in danger,

534
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,760
we'll have each other's back.

535
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,440
Maybe more?

536
00:54:58,320 --> 00:54:59,599
I have a small child.

537
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:07,159
-Get it done.
-Don't worry.

538
00:55:13,480 --> 00:55:16,000
Anyone who's drunk this oath water

539
00:55:16,639 --> 00:55:20,000
and later betrays his brothers,

540
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:24,719
may he die by the sword.

541
00:55:25,159 --> 00:55:28,559
May bullets and storms take his life.

542
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,840
Even in his death,

543
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,679
may he burn in hell and never be reborn.

544
00:55:49,559 --> 00:55:53,400
We pledge our loyalty to the nation

545
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:56,000
to the people

546
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:59,159
and to our duty.

547
00:56:38,639 --> 00:56:42,880
BUTR PHANTHARAK

548
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,679
You've put your blood stamp in the book.

549
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,199
From now on, you're Tiger Butr.

550
00:57:08,280 --> 00:57:09,960
And these men...

551
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:16,039
are your blood brothers.

552
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,599
Tiger Bai, Tiger Fai, Tiger Butr,
brothers forever!

553
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:33,000
Forever!

554
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,599
We grow our own rice.
We give away the surplus to the villagers

555
00:58:17,679 --> 00:58:19,239
or the monks.

556
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,440
All of Fai's gang live here?

557
00:58:21,519 --> 00:58:23,000
No.

558
00:58:23,719 --> 00:58:26,800
It's the village
where Bai and myself grew up.

559
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:31,559
The police know nothing about it,
so Fai likes to come here.

560
00:58:31,639 --> 00:58:34,480
Repeat after me.

561
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:37,559
-They sell...
-They sell...

562
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,719
-Louder. They sell...
-They sell...

563
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:47,360
-Silk...
-Let's go.

564
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,400
-New pots and pans...
-New pots and pans...

565
00:58:52,239 --> 00:58:54,519
So, where is Fai's base?

566
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,199
You ask many questions!

567
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,519
Well, there's no base,

568
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,000
no stronghold.

569
00:59:07,719 --> 00:59:08,679
What?

570
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:12,599
-Really?
-Why would I lie?

571
00:59:14,039 --> 00:59:17,199
We live anywhere we want.

572
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:19,480
With villagers usually.

573
00:59:20,159 --> 00:59:22,079
There's many tigers in Fai's gang

574
00:59:22,679 --> 00:59:25,400
that he has to have a record book.

575
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,079
He's smart.

576
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:30,039
He let the villagers spread the rumor

577
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:33,719
that he uses black magic to hide his base.

578
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:38,360
When the police hear this story,
they get chicken-shit.

579
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:42,760
That's why the cops
are always one step behind him.

580
00:59:45,039 --> 00:59:47,480
-Hey, Bai.
-Give me that.

581
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:49,920
Thieving, huh.

582
00:59:57,079 --> 01:00:00,280
These children are orphans.

583
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:03,519
Their fathers are criminals, like us.

584
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:07,719
Some are locked up. Some were shot dead.

585
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,559
Fai has taken care of them all.
I send them to school.

586
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:17,360
Because if they can't read, the
authorities will take advantage of them.

587
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:21,360
If they grow up to become bandits,
they'll end up with Fai.

588
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:24,800
Like Bia and myself.

589
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:34,119
Hi, kid.

590
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,320
THAI LIFE INSURANCE

591
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,719
Gather round, folks!

592
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:41,960
This is a new Thai company.

593
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:45,159
We'll take care of your lives.

594
01:00:45,239 --> 01:00:48,519
Governor Thammarong
doesn't give a damn about poor people.

595
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:52,400
He buys votes
and calls himself a representative.

596
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:58,639
He is more like a crook to me.

597
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,760
Right. But if you run for election,

598
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,880
I'm sure the people will vote for you.

599
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,440
Everyone!

600
01:01:12,519 --> 01:01:15,519
We're a Thai company.

601
01:01:15,599 --> 01:01:19,400
We're ready to take care of you.

602
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,000
The country is going through a hard time.

603
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,800
Only Thai people
can take care of other Thais.

604
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:28,480
Life insurance will give you security.

605
01:01:29,039 --> 01:01:31,760
What's certain in life is uncertainty.

606
01:01:32,639 --> 01:01:36,679
-Life insurance is a safety net...
-Don't!

607
01:02:29,760 --> 01:02:31,280
Buddhang Pacchagami.

608
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:33,320
Sambaddhicami.

609
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:44,599
Will he make it?

610
01:03:12,119 --> 01:03:14,159
You know nothing
about Governor Thammarong.

611
01:03:17,679 --> 01:03:19,679
Enlighten me.

612
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:27,360
He used to be
an influential district chief.

613
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:31,400
He's Fai's friend.
They rely on each other.

614
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:35,079
They link up the state
and the criminal world.

615
01:03:37,639 --> 01:03:41,519
That's why no policemen
has dared to touch Bandit Fai.

616
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:44,760
Now that Thammarong tried to take him out,

617
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:48,880
it means the order came from
someone above him.

618
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:52,440
The central plains tigers
are playing above their weight.

619
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:58,000
How do I pay you for the intel?

620
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:02,920
Just don't die.

621
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:05,880
There's not many men like you around.

622
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:12,800
Half of Suphan

623
01:04:14,199 --> 01:04:17,840
is mine, and the other half is his.

624
01:04:18,280 --> 01:04:21,360
All villagers will become nothing
but his servants

625
01:04:22,199 --> 01:04:24,119
if we let him take our part.

626
01:04:25,079 --> 01:04:28,119
When that day comes,

627
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:32,239
Suphan will legally belong
to that corrupt politician!

628
01:04:33,639 --> 01:04:35,360
Taking on the governor

629
01:04:37,360 --> 01:04:38,639
is a tough job.

630
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:44,960
In three days,

631
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:48,239
Governor Thammarong will host
a reception for the merchants

632
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:52,039
and wealthy bureaucrats
he wants to recruit into his party.

633
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:55,960
I've been asked to bring the girls
to entertain them.

634
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:01,719
The guests will bring cash
to contribute to the vote-buying fund.

635
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,159
We'll take the money

636
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,000
and kill them all.

637
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:15,639
Governor Thammarong is a fine man
Now give him a hand

638
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:19,280
Vote for him! He's a good man.

639
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:21,960
-Thank you.
-Go to the poll.

640
01:05:22,199 --> 01:05:23,800
Thank you!

641
01:05:23,880 --> 01:05:28,239
-Hi, everyone.
-I'm Thammarong. Vote No.1!

642
01:05:28,320 --> 01:05:32,880
-Good business?
-It's good.

643
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,480
Today the boss wants to have fun

644
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,280
Come here, father, mother and son

645
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:44,039
If you want a man who gets things done

646
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:47,639
Please vote for No.1

647
01:05:47,719 --> 01:05:51,199
Governor Thammarong is a good man

648
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:58,199
Vote for him in the poll

649
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:10,760
We'd like to contribute
to the governor's campaign.

650
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:17,159
Thank you so much! Whoa! That's a lot!

651
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:21,280
I won't let you down.

652
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:30,480
-Hide.
-Shoot if you dare, baby-face!

653
01:06:33,679 --> 01:06:35,719
Fai!

654
01:06:39,159 --> 01:06:40,880
Hide.

655
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:46,719
-Hey!
-Go!

656
01:07:29,239 --> 01:07:31,880
No.

657
01:07:49,039 --> 01:07:51,559
-Fai, the police!
-Hey.

658
01:07:57,480 --> 01:08:01,239
-Go, I'll hold them.
-I want them all dead.

659
01:08:06,880 --> 01:08:07,880
Go.

660
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,319
Vadho No-a Mama Vava. Hey!

661
01:09:11,239 --> 01:09:14,000
Take care of this.
I'll go help the captain.

662
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:15,720
-Go.
-Yes.

663
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:51,279
-Hey. Fai's here!
-He's back!

664
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:53,600
Stop.

665
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:54,680
Ming!

666
01:09:56,119 --> 01:09:58,439
-Take the money.
-Sir.

667
01:09:59,199 --> 01:10:01,720
-Bia.
-Duen. Dao.

668
01:10:03,640 --> 01:10:07,319
Dao, Duen! My darlings!

669
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:11,000
It's going to be a very noisy night,

670
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:14,479
sorry about that!

671
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:19,319
-Damn Bia.
-OK.

672
01:10:19,399 --> 01:10:21,720
I'll make you mine!

673
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:27,600
-Let's go inside.
-Go for it.

674
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:29,680
Hey, everybody.

675
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:33,720
Besides money,
I have something else for you guys:

676
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:37,279
Letters! Your wife wrote...

677
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:42,520
-The baby can call your name now.
-Thank you, Bai.

678
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,039
Bad news...

679
01:10:45,079 --> 01:10:46,079
Your husband said:

680
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:49,439
"Come pick me up from prison
in two months."

681
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,840
Yay!

682
01:10:50,920 --> 01:10:54,119
Daddy will come soon.

683
01:11:09,079 --> 01:11:10,079
Bai...

684
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:14,920
Had your shot hit me instead of him,

685
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,680
would you have been sad?

686
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:22,600
Of course.

687
01:11:25,119 --> 01:11:26,279
In my life...

688
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:30,640
I made a big mistake once.

689
01:11:34,479 --> 01:11:35,960
I won't let it happen again.

690
01:12:03,479 --> 01:12:05,159
My life belongs to you.

691
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:32,039
Take it.

692
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,520
Sometimes a big change

693
01:12:36,800 --> 01:12:38,520
has to come from the roots.

694
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:41,680
We must plant new seeds.

695
01:12:43,439 --> 01:12:47,439
-What do you want to do when you grow up?
-I want to be a policeman.

696
01:12:48,319 --> 01:12:50,279
A district chief.

697
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,880
A merchant.

698
01:12:54,359 --> 01:12:55,479
And you?

699
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,199
A soldier.

700
01:12:57,560 --> 01:12:59,720
All right. Go to bed now.

701
01:13:10,199 --> 01:13:13,520
Why do you want to see me?

702
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:22,399
I wonder who tipped off the police
to raid Thammarong's rally.

703
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:26,079
Find the mole.

704
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:34,319
Time for bed.

705
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:27,039
Tubtim seems so deep in love with Bai.

706
01:14:27,720 --> 01:14:30,479
Tiger Bai avenged
the death of her parents.

707
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,680
It was all because of
a pack of sticky rice.

708
01:14:34,439 --> 01:14:36,359
Tubtim was sold to a brothel.

709
01:14:38,640 --> 01:14:41,840
Her very first client was Bai.

710
01:14:42,640 --> 01:14:46,920
She had not a dime on her,
just a pack of sticky rice.

711
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,119
Next morning,

712
01:14:50,359 --> 01:14:53,560
Tiger Bai went and killed the men
who murdered her parents.

713
01:14:56,239 --> 01:14:57,680
They've found

714
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:01,000
that precious thing in each other.

715
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:04,760
They've found...

716
01:15:06,279 --> 01:15:07,159
love.

717
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,399
You sound scared tonight.

718
01:15:14,399 --> 01:15:17,000
We're on a tiger's back.

719
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:21,439
It's dangerous.

720
01:15:23,279 --> 01:15:25,039
But I'm not scared.

721
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:27,880
Not right now.

722
01:16:23,239 --> 01:16:24,520
You're telling me

723
01:16:25,199 --> 01:16:27,359
you've disobeyed the suspension order

724
01:16:28,399 --> 01:16:30,760
and embedded yourself
in Bandit Fai's gang?

725
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:34,479
I suspect

726
01:16:35,279 --> 01:16:38,760
that the murders of the police clerks

727
01:16:39,079 --> 01:16:41,000
must have something to do with Fai's gang.

728
01:16:41,439 --> 01:16:43,000
Right now...

729
01:16:46,239 --> 01:16:48,119
I know his hiding place.

730
01:16:50,560 --> 01:16:52,600
I'll tell you.

731
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:56,079
But promise me

732
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:58,920
that you won't use excessive force.

733
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:04,079
In my career as a policeman,

734
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,520
I've killed plenty of bad men.

735
01:17:07,479 --> 01:17:10,199
But their number
never seems to have declined.

736
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:13,279
One day I realized that...

737
01:17:14,079 --> 01:17:15,680
giving them a chance

738
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:18,279
could reduce the number of criminals.

739
01:17:19,279 --> 01:17:21,159
These people are just misled.

740
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,319
All they need is a second chance.

741
01:17:25,239 --> 01:17:27,039
On your feet, please.

742
01:17:28,239 --> 01:17:30,520
Pol. Maj. Gen. Khun Pan,

743
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:33,239
I hereby reinstate your official rank.

744
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,520
I assign you to the operation
to suppress the central plains bandits.

745
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,600
Effective immediately.

746
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:45,439
Thank you, Deputy.

747
01:17:49,159 --> 01:17:52,279
You're lucky that the bullet
went through your cheek.

748
01:17:52,760 --> 01:17:54,600
It didn't hit your brain.

749
01:17:55,800 --> 01:17:59,119
But the extensive burns on your body...

750
01:18:00,279 --> 01:18:04,479
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do
about it.

751
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,399
You're drunk again.
I shouldn't have run away with you.

752
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:15,000
Right, Lamduan,

753
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,239
you shouldn't have married me, either.

754
01:19:22,199 --> 01:19:24,319
I miss you, Bai.

755
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,439
Can I sit with you?

756
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:50,880
Go ahead.

757
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,159
Here.

758
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:07,079
Let me ask you something.

759
01:20:08,119 --> 01:20:10,000
Why did you become a bandit?

760
01:20:12,039 --> 01:20:13,439
Why not?

761
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,600
It's a good life.

762
01:20:17,159 --> 01:20:18,680
Lots of money.

763
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:22,199
Well, I give it away
to anyone who's in trouble.

764
01:20:22,680 --> 01:20:24,840
What I have left I send back to my wife.

765
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,479
I don't want to stay with my wife

766
01:20:29,840 --> 01:20:31,359
because I can't stand her!

767
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:37,439
She's an old bat. Always complaining.
"You're drunk again," blah, blah.

768
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:39,840
And you know,

769
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:42,399
you can't trust

770
01:20:43,000 --> 01:20:44,960
the law.

771
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:48,079
Guns are justice,

772
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,800
the rest is bullshit.

773
01:20:54,079 --> 01:20:55,680
Damn!

774
01:21:13,640 --> 01:21:15,840
Let me go!

775
01:21:17,159 --> 01:21:20,119
-Don't touch me.
-Lamduan!

776
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:35,479
Lamduan...

777
01:21:36,279 --> 01:21:39,279
Lamduan!

778
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:44,279
Run!

779
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:45,960
No, Lamduan!

780
01:21:46,039 --> 01:21:49,560
Lamduan!

781
01:21:51,479 --> 01:21:52,520
Lamduan?

782
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:55,960
Lamduan!

783
01:22:20,720 --> 01:22:22,720
Have you ever thought

784
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,239
of giving yourself up?

785
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:30,800
Lamduan,

786
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:34,600
let me be free...

787
01:23:02,399 --> 01:23:05,239
Dumb card again, Officer Isra.

788
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,720
Your ambition
is getting the better of you.

789
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,479
If you hadn't agreed,

790
01:23:12,560 --> 01:23:16,039
Governor Thammarong would never
have had the nerve to hit me.

791
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,960
I know that eventually
you'll be the winner in this game.

792
01:23:20,319 --> 01:23:24,199
It's time you came out of the dark, Fai.

793
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:29,079
Enter politics and stop sneaking around
like petty thieves.

794
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:31,359
You need to decide.

795
01:23:32,399 --> 01:23:35,079
The government has issued death warrants
on the Blackshirt Bandits.

796
01:23:36,239 --> 01:23:37,520
Think about it.

797
01:24:01,399 --> 01:24:02,760
Hey!

798
01:24:03,279 --> 01:24:06,680
Someone asked me to deliver this.

799
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:17,960
Tubtim!

800
01:25:19,159 --> 01:25:22,680
-Don't come near me! Explosives!
-Tubtim!

801
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:27,760
Tubtim!

802
01:25:35,560 --> 01:25:37,239
-Bai!
-Butr!

803
01:25:44,439 --> 01:25:47,399
Hello. You two are fast.

804
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:48,960
Who the fuck are you?

805
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,279
Show yourself, coward!

806
01:25:52,960 --> 01:25:54,039
What do you want?

807
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:57,720
Bandit Bai, you should thank me.

808
01:25:59,239 --> 01:26:02,720
I've arranged this confessional meeting
for you.

809
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:04,520
What the hell are you talking about?

810
01:26:05,279 --> 01:26:06,680
Khun Pan, feel like talking?

811
01:26:07,279 --> 01:26:09,439
Tell him who you are.

812
01:26:18,239 --> 01:26:21,520
Will you tell him or not?

813
01:26:22,840 --> 01:26:23,960
Tubtim!

814
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:29,640
One...

815
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,079
Two...

816
01:26:39,399 --> 01:26:40,239
I'm a policeman.

817
01:27:09,560 --> 01:27:12,000
-Tubtim.
-Bai!

818
01:27:12,079 --> 01:27:16,000
-Tubtim. Go!
-Don't come in.

819
01:27:16,079 --> 01:27:18,279
Don't!

820
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,319
Tubtim!

821
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:27,840
-Get out of here. Bai.
-Tubtim!

822
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,920
-Tubtim. Go!
-No!

823
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:33,000
No!

824
01:27:35,119 --> 01:27:39,840
Had the bullet hit me,
would you have been sad?

825
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:43,439
Of course.

826
01:27:46,479 --> 01:27:47,720
In my life...

827
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:52,079
I made a big mistake once...

828
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:00,039
Tubtim! Please don't die!

829
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,319
Tubtim!

830
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:06,920
We'll settle this after her funeral.

831
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,199
If you're enough of a man.

832
01:30:00,279 --> 01:30:03,520
I know you'll be the winner
in this game eventually.

833
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:07,760
It's time you came out of the dark, Fai.

834
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:09,920
What do I have to lose?

835
01:30:11,920 --> 01:30:13,279
You will be arrested.

836
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,920
If you die, your ideology dies with you.

837
01:30:20,199 --> 01:30:23,720
But if you still want to fix this country,

838
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,079
this is the price you have to pay.

839
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,239
You and I both know this.

840
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:33,840
Now what you have to do... is help me

841
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:39,880
shut down all the central plains gangs.
Including yours.

842
01:30:40,199 --> 01:30:44,159
Then I'll testify that you've been
working as our informer.

843
01:30:45,079 --> 01:30:46,079
Deal?

844
01:30:58,479 --> 01:30:59,359
Cheers.

845
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,239
Vandhidava.

846
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:00,720
Achariyang.

847
01:32:01,079 --> 01:32:03,279
Gruba-dhang.

848
01:32:12,439 --> 01:32:16,760
MISS TUBTIM MONGKOLSAP

849
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:22,720
The magic bullet can go right through
your protective spell.

850
01:33:24,319 --> 01:33:26,640
Only when you can see me.

851
01:34:01,960 --> 01:34:04,079
-Bai!
-Bia!

852
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,159
The cops! They know all our names.

853
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:14,039
The Blackshirts have been killed
one after another.

854
01:34:24,399 --> 01:34:27,960
Sir, there's a gunfight.

855
01:34:41,479 --> 01:34:44,079
Fai, you've betrayed us!

856
01:35:08,439 --> 01:35:11,760
I'm sorry, Bai. I have no choice.

857
01:35:33,439 --> 01:35:35,960
Mister...

858
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:38,800
Slowly.

859
01:35:46,119 --> 01:35:47,079
Get him down.

860
01:35:48,680 --> 01:35:50,159
Lock him.

861
01:36:30,239 --> 01:36:32,359
TO STEAL SOMEONE'S BLACK MAGIC

862
01:36:32,439 --> 01:36:35,520
REMOVE HIS TATTOOED SKIN
AND STITCH IT ON YOURS

863
01:36:35,600 --> 01:36:37,399
HOW TO DESTROY SOMEONE'S SPELL

864
01:36:37,479 --> 01:36:38,880
LET HIM TOUCH MENSTRUAL BLOOD

865
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,039
COVER HIS HEAD WITH A WOMAN'S SKIRT

866
01:37:15,640 --> 01:37:17,000
Why did you help me?

867
01:37:20,319 --> 01:37:21,520
Conscience.

868
01:37:26,319 --> 01:37:27,760
This time, too?

869
01:37:30,520 --> 01:37:33,680
I'll take you in alive
if you give yourself up

870
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:36,960
and testify in your favor to the police.

871
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,199
I can't promise...

872
01:37:44,239 --> 01:37:45,439
I'll turn myself in.

873
01:37:49,079 --> 01:37:50,880
But if you want me to talk,

874
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:54,840
I'm ready.

875
01:37:56,720 --> 01:37:58,279
What do you know?

876
01:37:59,439 --> 01:38:00,720
Deputy Padet...

877
01:38:02,560 --> 01:38:04,960
is the mastermind
behind the Blackshirt racket.

878
01:38:05,560 --> 01:38:07,399
Tiger Fai is his key player.

879
01:38:08,479 --> 01:38:11,560
They ordered us to steal all the opium
from the government's warehouses

880
01:38:13,119 --> 01:38:18,760
and resell it to the market
at twice the price.

881
01:38:20,479 --> 01:38:22,640
He bribed a group of police clerks

882
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:25,560
to cook the books.

883
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:29,119
One day, an innocent clerk...

884
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:30,319
DOCUMENTS TO DESTROY

885
01:38:30,399 --> 01:38:33,359
...found out about the scheme.

886
01:38:40,880 --> 01:38:41,880
Roj.

887
01:38:44,159 --> 01:38:47,760
The amount of the confiscation is unequal
to the one being destroyed.

888
01:38:47,840 --> 01:38:49,079
-Let me take a look.
-Here.

889
01:38:52,520 --> 01:38:55,279
Nothing to worry about.
This is an outdated file.

890
01:38:57,880 --> 01:39:01,760
So, the deputy ordered Fai
to send hit men to kill them.

891
01:39:06,479 --> 01:39:08,399
But the men he sent were drunk.

892
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:11,239
Instead of taking out a few clerks,

893
01:39:11,800 --> 01:39:13,800
they massacred the whole precinct.

894
01:39:14,800 --> 01:39:15,960
Deputy Padet was pressured

895
01:39:17,880 --> 01:39:19,560
to end the Blackshirt gambit.

896
01:39:21,039 --> 01:39:22,640
I should've guessed it.

897
01:39:25,239 --> 01:39:27,800
When Fai sent us to kill
Governor Thammarong,

898
01:39:30,880 --> 01:39:32,960
it was only for his own
political aspirations.

899
01:39:34,079 --> 01:39:35,359
Where's the opium now?

900
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:42,880
Busara!

901
01:39:46,600 --> 01:39:50,119
I'm here to pick up a package.

902
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:52,079
Where are you?

903
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,720
You're in the house of pleasure.

904
01:40:13,479 --> 01:40:15,560
Enjoy yourself first.

905
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:17,680
You go first.

906
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:19,720
I'll wait here.

907
01:40:31,479 --> 01:40:32,600
Come,

908
01:40:33,880 --> 01:40:35,199
handsome...

909
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,279
Go.

910
01:41:18,399 --> 01:41:20,760
So, this is who you are.

911
01:41:21,520 --> 01:41:22,600
Officer.

912
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:26,880
Now you know me,

913
01:41:27,479 --> 01:41:29,279
but I still don't know anything about you.

914
01:41:31,680 --> 01:41:33,159
I'm one of the Blackshirts,

915
01:41:34,880 --> 01:41:36,640
the criminals you're pursuing.

916
01:41:38,039 --> 01:41:40,960
My name is in that book.

917
01:41:41,439 --> 01:41:44,760
It's only that the role I've been given

918
01:41:45,479 --> 01:41:46,840
is different from those tigers.

919
01:41:51,720 --> 01:41:53,640
Why did you become a criminal?

920
01:41:56,760 --> 01:41:58,039
Survival, I guess.

921
01:41:58,720 --> 01:42:00,840
I could run to the end of the world.

922
01:42:01,279 --> 01:42:03,840
But as long as our names are in that book,

923
01:42:04,199 --> 01:42:06,880
Deputy Padet will come after me

924
01:42:08,319 --> 01:42:10,479
and everyone you're seeing here.

925
01:42:17,359 --> 01:42:18,560
This opium is the only evidence

926
01:42:19,479 --> 01:42:22,359
you can use to incriminate him.

927
01:42:24,119 --> 01:42:26,920
I'm sure he's sending his men to steal it

928
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:31,520
and to kill us all.

929
01:42:33,560 --> 01:42:36,039
We will help you guard this evidence

930
01:42:37,279 --> 01:42:38,560
if you promise

931
01:42:39,439 --> 01:42:41,359
to treat us as witnesses in the trial,

932
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:44,600
and let us go back to live a normal life.

933
01:43:03,319 --> 01:43:04,920
-Look out!
-Hey.

934
01:43:09,319 --> 01:43:11,680
Joi!

935
01:43:12,680 --> 01:43:15,079
Joi! What happened?

936
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,319
-How're you doing?
-My leg, boss.

937
01:43:17,399 --> 01:43:18,800
Why are you here?

938
01:43:19,840 --> 01:43:23,840
-What the hell are you doing!
-Ouch.

939
01:43:24,720 --> 01:43:25,680
What the hell?

940
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,399
-Joi, hurry up!
-Joi, shoot him!

941
01:43:29,479 --> 01:43:31,800
-Shoot him!
-Quickly!

942
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:35,079
-Quickly!
-Joi!

943
01:43:35,159 --> 01:43:37,640
-Come help.
-Hurry up!

944
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,960
Get down!

945
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,479
Asawin!

946
01:44:12,039 --> 01:44:13,640
Stop that.

947
01:44:18,079 --> 01:44:20,720
Let the sacred water be our witness.

948
01:44:21,279 --> 01:44:25,159
We share gold.

949
01:44:29,479 --> 01:44:31,880
Anyone who's drunk this oath water

950
01:44:32,520 --> 01:44:36,000
and later betrays his brothers...

951
01:44:36,399 --> 01:44:37,680
May he die

952
01:44:38,039 --> 01:44:40,479
by the sword.

953
01:44:41,079 --> 01:44:42,840
May bullets

954
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:45,800
and storms take his life.

955
01:44:46,680 --> 01:44:49,039
Even in his death,

956
01:44:49,319 --> 01:44:52,680
may he burn in hell and never be reborn.

957
01:45:04,319 --> 01:45:08,119
Relinquish the black magic,
so you can die without suffering.

958
01:45:19,479 --> 01:45:26,439
Namo Buddhaya. Have them out.

959
01:45:27,840 --> 01:45:31,760
Tiger Bai, Tiger Fai, Tiger Butr.

960
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:34,399
-Brothers forever!
-Forever!

961
01:45:39,000 --> 01:45:40,520
Allow me.

962
01:46:36,319 --> 01:46:38,399
By the power of great masters.

963
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,359
I am wearing these talismans on my skin.

964
01:46:42,800 --> 01:46:47,199
The 84,000 verses of the scriptures
are now a part of me.

965
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:39,159
Think you're so clever?

966
01:47:40,119 --> 01:47:42,159
Paying bandits to get rid of bandits.

967
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:46,359
You think the Blackshirts
will kill one another?

968
01:49:24,760 --> 01:49:26,239
Search!

969
01:49:47,920 --> 01:49:50,239
Where's the opium?

970
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:53,880
Khun Pan... I want him dead.

971
01:50:09,359 --> 01:50:10,319
Where the hell is he?

972
01:52:06,119 --> 01:52:08,560
Vadho No-a Mama Vava. Hey!

973
01:52:49,560 --> 01:52:51,439
Girls, hide first.

974
01:52:51,640 --> 01:52:53,319
-Come here.
-Now!

975
01:52:56,680 --> 01:52:59,520
-Go!
-Run!

976
01:53:21,760 --> 01:53:24,079
Busara, go! Everyone! Go!

977
01:54:33,960 --> 01:54:35,279
Shall we arrest them?

978
01:54:37,960 --> 01:54:42,640
Arrest your ass! Haven't you seen?
You want to get killed, too?

979
01:54:42,720 --> 01:54:45,079
Let's run!

980
01:54:48,119 --> 01:54:49,159
Let's go!

981
01:55:01,479 --> 01:55:04,119
Bai, you're under arrest.

982
01:55:14,680 --> 01:55:15,720
Go.

983
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:18,479
Papers.

984
01:55:33,520 --> 01:55:36,319
Captain, they're all Blackshirts.

985
01:55:38,359 --> 01:55:43,279
There are many things that can't be
beaten with supernatural power.

986
01:55:43,359 --> 01:55:47,680
After arresting Tiger Bai,
I gathered all the evidence

987
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:51,640
-to bring Deputy Padet to justice.
-You ordered Fai to rob the opium

988
01:55:51,720 --> 01:55:54,399
then you doctored the books.

989
01:55:55,479 --> 01:55:59,520
You know it belongs to me.
How did you dare touch it?

990
01:56:01,640 --> 01:56:03,479
Because I'm a police officer.

991
01:56:03,560 --> 01:56:07,119
Anyway,
thanks for delivering the evidence.

992
01:56:07,199 --> 01:56:11,520
This will back up the report
I've sent to Headquarters

993
01:56:12,319 --> 01:56:14,039
that Isra is the mastermind.

994
01:56:14,119 --> 01:56:18,039
-The deputy dumped it all on Isra.
-Sir!

995
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:22,920
His signature in the accounts
sealed his fate.

996
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,840
-Deputy Padet walked free.
-What's this!

997
01:56:25,920 --> 01:56:30,800
Let me go! Sir! You can't do this!

998
01:56:30,880 --> 01:56:33,720
-Padet, you asshole.
-Try harder next time.

999
01:56:33,800 --> 01:56:37,600
Power always gives you more options.

1000
01:56:42,359 --> 01:56:44,000
But the consequences

1001
01:56:44,079 --> 01:56:46,399
-depend on which one you'll choose.
-I know that eventually

1002
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,039
you'll be the winner in this game.

1003
01:56:50,479 --> 01:56:55,600
Some choose the path
where they'll become somebody.

1004
01:56:56,720 --> 01:56:59,920
Hey, Bai. Are you dead or what?

1005
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,239
Others choose the path

1006
01:57:02,319 --> 01:57:06,039
-where they'll disappear forever.
-Shit!

1007
01:57:06,520 --> 01:57:10,319
Tiger Bai has escaped! Find him!

1008
01:57:10,399 --> 01:57:12,159
He's escaped!

1009
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:14,079
In this country,

1010
01:57:14,920 --> 01:57:17,920
you can pay your way through everything.

1011
01:57:28,319 --> 01:57:32,000
You can even avoid jail
if you have enough money.

1012
01:57:37,000 --> 01:57:39,720
It's a fact,
I can't convince anyone otherwise.

1013
01:57:40,239 --> 01:57:43,600
I just hope that sometimes,
luck will be on the right side.

1014
01:57:44,680 --> 01:57:49,880
You've cleared his name,
he died an innocent man.

1015
01:57:50,279 --> 01:57:52,720
That's more than he could ever ask for.

1016
01:57:54,760 --> 01:57:57,039
I did my best.

1017
01:57:57,640 --> 01:58:03,319
He told me to bury
all his belongings in his grave.

1018
01:58:38,439 --> 01:58:43,760
PROVINCIAL POLICE REGION 1

1019
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:49,840
Excuse me, sir.

1020
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:53,199
And I just hope that one day,

1021
01:58:53,760 --> 01:58:56,760
I'll find the answer
that validates my belief

1022
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:58,560
and what I'm fighting for.

1023
01:59:07,439 --> 01:59:14,439
THE ONLY TRUE FAITH
IS OUR FAITH IN VIRTUE

1024
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:20,119
THE MOTIVATION TO MAKE THIS FILM

1025
01:59:22,159 --> 01:59:24,239
"I WAS INSPIRED BY

1026
01:59:24,319 --> 01:59:28,239
THE IMAGE OF KHUN PAN LIGHTING
A CANDLE, FROM KING RAMA IX.

1027
01:59:28,319 --> 01:59:32,520
IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS RECEIVING
A ROYAL BLESSING,

1028
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:37,960
AND AN INSPIRATION
TO DO GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY.

1029
01:59:38,039 --> 01:59:43,239
THAI PEOPLE
MUST KEEP THAT CANDLE BURNING."
