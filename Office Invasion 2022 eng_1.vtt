[static]

00:39.240 --> 00:42.600
[in Zulu] Hey, guys.
Has anybody been working in the vault?

00:43.760 --> 00:44.800
[walkie-talkie beeps]

00:45.560 --> 00:48.040
[in English] Guys? Is anyone
working in the vault tonight?

00:48.120 --> 00:49.120
[walkie-talkie beeps]

00:52.240 --> 00:53.640
Shit.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.080
Hello? Hello?

01:02.160 --> 01:05.080
[dramatic music plays]

01:07.000 --> 01:08.480
[door closes]

01:10.920 --> 01:12.760
Hey, guys. It's not funny.

01:12.840 --> 01:14.760
If you idiots think
you're gonna scare me today,

01:14.840 --> 01:16.120
it's not going to happen.

01:21.920 --> 01:24.360
[tense music playing]

01:26.040 --> 01:28.000
Hello? Who's there?

01:36.080 --> 01:40.800
[with Russian accent]
Happy birthday, George.

01:45.600 --> 01:46.560
[clicks tongue]

01:49.840 --> 01:51.520
Are you coming?

01:52.120 --> 01:53.000
[giggles]

01:54.920 --> 01:55.880
Yes, madam!

01:59.680 --> 02:01.400
Thank you, boys. Thank you, bra God.

02:01.480 --> 02:03.760
Oh, Georgie…

02:07.760 --> 02:09.400
[George] So, what's your name?

02:11.520 --> 02:13.600
You know, we should not be in here.

02:13.680 --> 02:15.600
I mean, we can do this in the office.

02:15.680 --> 02:16.880
Not that I'm complaining.

02:16.960 --> 02:19.960
It's just that this room
gets a little bit cold, you know,

02:20.040 --> 02:21.680
and makes other things smaller.

02:21.760 --> 02:22.960
[clothes thud]

02:24.280 --> 02:25.640
[snarling]

02:25.720 --> 02:28.600
[George screaming]

02:37.480 --> 02:39.880
[munching sounds]

02:45.280 --> 02:47.400
[birds chirping]

02:51.160 --> 02:54.920
[man] Okay, Chen. Listen to me. All right?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.320
As I mentioned before,

02:56.400 --> 02:59.480
even if I were with sales,
there's nothing I can do.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.040
You've got to be on the list.

03:01.120 --> 03:04.520
Come on, Sam. Don't give me that shit.
I only need a few liters.

03:04.600 --> 03:05.720
Nobody needs to know.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.600
It's not the amount
that's the problem, it's…

03:09.640 --> 03:11.320
What do you want it for, anyway?

03:11.400 --> 03:13.440
What… What do I want it for?

03:15.160 --> 03:17.080
[sighs] We're….

03:17.760 --> 03:21.240
developing medical equipment
to help children with cancer?

03:21.880 --> 03:23.080
You like children, don't you?

03:23.160 --> 03:26.160
Yeah, of course.
Of course I like children.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.720
But that's not the point.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.080
Look, Sam,

03:29.160 --> 03:32.280
I'm willing to pay
very good money, all right?

03:32.360 --> 03:35.520
The kind that will bring
all the girls to your yard.

03:35.600 --> 03:36.520
You understand?

03:36.600 --> 03:38.120
Uh, I understand,

03:38.200 --> 03:40.600
I understand, but, uh… [chuckles]

03:40.680 --> 03:42.640
I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do.

03:42.720 --> 03:45.120
<i>All right? I can't help you. Bye-bye.</i>

03:45.200 --> 03:47.800
Got to go. Got to… go.

03:49.960 --> 03:51.920
[Sam] <i>So, why am I getting calls</i>

03:52.000 --> 03:54.280
<i>from Chinese gangsters</i>
<i>at eight in the morning?</i>

03:54.360 --> 03:57.880
<i>Well, that's because we mine</i>
<i>the only Zulcanoid deposit on Earth.</i>

03:57.960 --> 04:01.360
<i>And right now, Zulcanoid is on fire.</i>

04:02.440 --> 04:05.080
<i>It's basically a liquid metal</i>
<i>similar to mercury.</i>

04:05.160 --> 04:08.120
<i>Except it won't poison you</i>
<i>or make you want to eat your own face.</i>

04:08.800 --> 04:10.400
<i>And that makes it valuable.</i>

04:10.480 --> 04:12.640
<i>Only problem is,</i>
<i>we can't keep up with demand.</i>

04:12.720 --> 04:15.760
<i>Which hasn't always been the case.</i>
<i>Believe me.</i>

04:15.840 --> 04:17.800
<i>But after struggling for so many years,</i>

04:17.880 --> 04:20.440
<i>it feels like we've finally arrived.</i>

04:21.040 --> 04:24.160
<i>At last, things are falling into place.</i>

04:30.040 --> 04:31.280
We're screwed, man.

04:31.360 --> 04:34.160
I can't believe it. This is the end.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.320
It's way too early
in the morning for this.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.760
Take a breath, Liam. What's going on?

04:39.480 --> 04:40.960
Ah. Of course, of course.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.080
You haven't heard. You were at the mine.

04:43.160 --> 04:44.040
Heard what, Liam?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.280
Bheki's stepping down.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.240
It's the whole thing with his lungs.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.560
Melusi's taking over.

04:50.640 --> 04:51.560
My God.

04:51.640 --> 04:54.000
No, Sam. God has forsaken us.

04:55.040 --> 04:57.520
And the devil's called
a management meeting you gotta be at now.

04:57.600 --> 04:58.760
What?

04:59.360 --> 05:01.080
-Yeah! Hustle, hustle, hustle.
-Okay.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.680
Sorry. Excuse me.

05:07.760 --> 05:09.560
Excuse me, please. Um…

05:09.640 --> 05:12.440
-Sorry. I should've sat in the front.
-[people muttering]

05:12.520 --> 05:13.840
Okay. Yeah, uh…

05:16.360 --> 05:18.120
Whoa. Whoa!

05:18.880 --> 05:21.320
Please stop! Wait. Wait. Wait!

05:21.400 --> 05:22.760
[cloth ripping]

05:29.600 --> 05:33.200
[Junior] <i>If you think</i>
<i>that's just bad luck, you've got no idea.</i>

05:33.720 --> 05:36.400
<i>The truth is, I'm cursed.</i>
<i>My whole family is.</i>

05:37.760 --> 05:39.120
<i>It began when my parents met.</i>

05:39.200 --> 05:40.640
<i>It was your classic love story,</i>

05:40.720 --> 05:42.120
<i>Dad stole Mom's heart.</i>

05:42.200 --> 05:43.840
<i>Then six months later,</i>

05:43.920 --> 05:45.400
<i>he stole the rest of her shit.</i>

05:45.480 --> 05:46.600
Shit!

05:48.360 --> 05:50.040
<i>He never came back after that.</i>

05:50.120 --> 05:54.160
<i>While on a job one night,</i>
<i>he got himself into a bit of a situation.</i>

05:54.240 --> 05:56.000
<i>He probably would've gotten away with it</i>

05:56.080 --> 05:58.920
<i>if it wasn't for</i>
<i>one small piece of bad luck.</i>

06:06.680 --> 06:09.720
-[grunting]
-[alarm blaring]

06:09.800 --> 06:12.160
[Junior]
<i>Because the universe has a sense of humor,</i>

06:12.240 --> 06:14.000
<i>I work as a security guard.</i>

06:14.080 --> 06:16.480
<i>Which, I suppose, could be worse.</i>

06:16.560 --> 06:19.080
<i>Like the rest of my life</i>
<i>in which I'm permanently broke,</i>

06:19.160 --> 06:21.040
<i>haven't had a girlfriend in five years,</i>

06:21.120 --> 06:25.680
<i>and am forced to live with two</i>
<i>of the world's most annoying roommates.</i>

06:25.760 --> 06:27.880
-Bingo.
-Oh, yum…

06:27.960 --> 06:29.600
We really shouldn't.

06:30.240 --> 06:32.320
I suppose he didn't say we couldn't look.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.720
He didn't say that.

06:35.160 --> 06:36.000
Exactly.

06:49.560 --> 06:50.520
[Junior] Seriously?

06:51.720 --> 06:53.760
Junior, what are you doing?

06:53.840 --> 06:54.760
What's that?

06:54.840 --> 06:56.800
Morning, boss. Sorry. That's not mine.

06:56.880 --> 06:59.520
Uh, my housemates stole my lunch.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.040
-I don't want to hear it.
-Right.

07:01.120 --> 07:04.880
HR's presenting this morning,
and we are all under the microscope.

07:04.960 --> 07:05.800
Yes, sir.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.840
Put on a jacket. It looks like
you slept in that shirt.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.400
Uh, sorry. About that, sir.

07:10.480 --> 07:13.360
There was an… incident this morning.

07:14.120 --> 07:16.520
My jacket kind of… [clears throat]

07:17.320 --> 07:18.320
…got away from me.

07:19.400 --> 07:20.960
[laughs]

07:21.040 --> 07:22.920
All right, let me get this straight.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.280
-You are a security guard…
-Yes, sir.

07:25.360 --> 07:28.880
…and both your jacket and your lunch
got stolen this morning?

07:29.400 --> 07:31.200
When you say it like that,
doesn't sound great.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.840
Enough! Get your…

07:34.720 --> 07:36.320
Get your shit together!

07:36.400 --> 07:38.480
Yes, sir. Sorry. I will.

07:41.920 --> 07:42.840
[Junior clears throat]

07:46.920 --> 07:47.920
[sighs]

07:48.040 --> 07:51.120
Since you hate your roommates so much,
why don't you just move out?

07:51.200 --> 07:54.800
Well, I would if I could, but…
I signed the lease.

07:54.880 --> 07:58.040
Then put them in their place, Junior.
Show them who they're dealing with.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.520
Yeah! Yeah.

08:00.600 --> 08:01.960
[laughs] Absolutely.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.800
Let them know who they're dealing with.

08:04.880 --> 08:07.200
I'm gonna do that… tonight.

08:07.280 --> 08:10.840
They're gonna feel… thunder.

08:11.720 --> 08:13.640
Okay. Good. Good.

08:13.720 --> 08:15.360
I will see you in the meeting.

08:15.440 --> 08:17.520
Yes, right. The meeting. I'll be there.

08:19.320 --> 08:22.000
"Feel the thunder." [laughs]

08:22.080 --> 08:24.440
I'm amazed she didn't
have sex with you right now.

08:24.520 --> 08:26.840
Okay, thank you. Shut up, please.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.560
Dude, look, just ask her out
and stop being a pussy.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.680
-I'm not being a pussy.
-You're a pussy.

08:31.760 --> 08:33.440
-I'm not! Can you stop?
-Pussy.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.320
-Stop that. Please. Just this once.
-Whatever.

08:36.720 --> 08:38.480
Why is HR coming to the meeting?

08:39.240 --> 08:41.680
I don't know. Maybe we're getting a raise?

08:41.760 --> 08:42.760
Really?

08:43.600 --> 08:45.160
It's like we've never met.

08:47.000 --> 08:48.160
[farts]

08:48.240 --> 08:50.680
[slurping]

08:53.480 --> 08:54.920
Oh shit.

08:55.000 --> 08:57.640
Hey, Sean. How're you doing?

08:57.720 --> 09:00.280
Fine, thanks. I'm just busy urinating.

09:00.360 --> 09:01.800
Yeah. Yeah, I see that.

09:01.880 --> 09:04.720
I saw Colleen earlier on who said,
"Hey, where's Prince?"

09:04.800 --> 09:06.160
And then I said,

09:06.240 --> 09:08.480
"Well, you know Prince.
He's probably late again."

09:09.160 --> 09:10.480
And I was right.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.680
Yeah.

09:11.760 --> 09:13.960
Mm! You want me
to go tell her that you've arrived?

09:14.040 --> 09:15.120
I can make that happen.

09:15.200 --> 09:16.960
No. I've got it.

09:17.040 --> 09:19.560
Listen, also, don't you want
to maybe just put it away?

09:19.640 --> 09:20.920
No one wants to see that.

09:21.000 --> 09:23.600
You know, I always
used to be late for things, Prince.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.840
Really? Yeah, and what did you do?

09:25.920 --> 09:28.280
I just arrived earlier. That's the secret.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.760
-Oh? It's a secret?
-Yup.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.160
[softly] Thanks for sharing.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.360
[urinating stops]

09:37.440 --> 09:38.960
Have a good day at work.

09:40.200 --> 09:42.560
[Prince]
<i>So, why am I always late for work?</i>

09:42.640 --> 09:45.040
<i>Well, it's not exactly a mystery.</i>

09:45.120 --> 09:47.640
<i>I hate my job.</i>

09:48.480 --> 09:50.000
<i>But I don't have a choice.</i>

09:50.080 --> 09:52.520
<i>According to the rules of my trust fund,</i>

09:52.600 --> 09:55.000
<i>I have to work</i>
<i>as an accountant for five years</i>

09:55.080 --> 09:56.920
<i>or else I'm cut off.</i>

09:57.480 --> 09:59.760
<i>Thank God I'm almost there.</i>

09:59.840 --> 10:02.120
<i>And then I'll get</i>
<i>to prove my father wrong.</i>

10:04.160 --> 10:05.320
Hey.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.680
Colleen? Hey. Good morning.

10:07.760 --> 10:09.080
How long you been in here?

10:09.160 --> 10:12.760
Uh, I don't know.
Like a few minutes, give or take.

10:12.840 --> 10:15.200
Yeah, is there anything I can help with?

10:15.280 --> 10:17.720
It's too late.
I sorted it out myself. As usual.

10:17.800 --> 10:19.080
Oh, okay.

10:19.760 --> 10:21.480
Are you almost done in here?

10:21.560 --> 10:23.560
You know we've got a meeting, right?

10:23.640 --> 10:27.200
Yeah. I will be there or be squared.
I'm so sorry.

10:27.880 --> 10:33.560
There is just something about you
that gets right up my ass.

10:35.120 --> 10:37.520
I think I'm gonna call in HR

10:37.600 --> 10:41.040
so we can have
another little heart-to-heart.

10:42.280 --> 10:44.760
Oh? Is that right?

10:45.480 --> 10:48.600
You think we need to have
a little chat with HR, do you?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.840
How's this for a heart-to-heart?

10:50.920 --> 10:51.920
[groans]

10:53.200 --> 10:54.560
[gasps]

10:54.640 --> 10:56.160
[dramatic music playing]

10:56.240 --> 10:58.440
[Prince]
What do you have to say now, Colleen?

10:58.520 --> 10:59.480
Huh?

10:59.560 --> 11:01.840
You know, I'm actually surprised
you have a heart!

11:02.840 --> 11:03.840
Fucking…

11:03.920 --> 11:05.440
[grunts]

11:05.520 --> 11:06.520
[music stops]

11:06.600 --> 11:07.880
What the hell are you doing?

11:07.960 --> 11:10.720
Oh, um, nothing. Nothing. I'm so sorry.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.240
Ah. Ooh.

11:12.320 --> 11:15.960
There is a spasm in my hand
from all the work I've been doing.

11:16.040 --> 11:19.920
I said I want you to take notes

11:20.000 --> 11:22.320
for our department in the meeting.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.880
You think you can handle that?

11:24.960 --> 11:26.800
Yeah, we got this. I… I got this.

11:26.880 --> 11:28.440
Um, anything you say, boss.

11:28.520 --> 11:29.560
Good.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.840
Was that you?

11:34.440 --> 11:36.920
-What?
-Are you the office pisser?

11:37.000 --> 11:37.840
No.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.400
Of course you are.

11:39.480 --> 11:41.440
I should've thought as much.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.680
Clean that up
or I'll give you another warning.

11:43.760 --> 11:44.920
Yeah, but I didn't do it.

11:45.000 --> 11:46.640
Then who was it, huh?

11:47.120 --> 11:48.400
Uh…

11:49.760 --> 11:50.600
[sighs]

11:50.680 --> 11:51.600
Thought so.

11:53.520 --> 11:54.800
Sort it out.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.680
You're disgusting.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.360
Why didn't you say something?
Come on, man.

12:04.120 --> 12:05.880
You know what? You deserve this.

12:08.120 --> 12:10.080
Oh, fuck.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.440
Oh! Fuck.

12:22.120 --> 12:27.160
My father started
this business with nothing.

12:28.320 --> 12:31.640
All he had was some dusty ground…

12:32.400 --> 12:33.760
a few millions,

12:33.840 --> 12:35.440
and a vision.

12:38.640 --> 12:40.480
Nice for you to join us, Sam.

12:43.280 --> 12:47.760
Alas, even visionaries have blind spots.

12:49.040 --> 12:50.440
This is why we're here.

12:51.120 --> 12:55.640
We are here to change your slow thinking.

12:55.720 --> 13:00.160
We are here to put spectacles on your eyes

13:00.240 --> 13:01.520
so you can see brighter.

13:02.360 --> 13:05.240
This is why we're here.
We're here to open your eyes.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.160
Gugu.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.720
What do we have here?

13:12.160 --> 13:14.400
Tell me what you see. Don't be scared.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.080
This is a free and safe space.

13:16.160 --> 13:17.000
No.

13:17.080 --> 13:18.400
Speak!

13:18.480 --> 13:19.760
Don't do it.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.480
Uh…

13:21.560 --> 13:23.000
Yeah, you! Go.

13:23.880 --> 13:25.080
Um…

13:26.760 --> 13:28.200
Good morning, everyone.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.120
Morning.

13:29.760 --> 13:32.360
Well, what I see is… you know, uh…

13:32.440 --> 13:34.400
it looks like, um…

13:36.040 --> 13:37.640
uh, an office, sir.

13:38.960 --> 13:39.880
Excuse me?

13:41.120 --> 13:44.840
Well, I mean, um,
from where I'm standing it kind of, uh…

13:44.920 --> 13:47.320
resembles, uh… um…

13:47.400 --> 13:51.160
somebody's, uh, you know, uh… office.

13:52.480 --> 13:53.480
Turn around.

13:53.560 --> 13:54.640
Sir? What?

13:54.720 --> 13:57.200
I don't want to look at your ugly face.
Turn around.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.840
-Don't even sit down. Just turn around.
-Okay.

14:05.120 --> 14:09.920
What we have here
is a cancer that's in this business.

14:10.760 --> 14:12.320
Starting from today,

14:13.080 --> 14:15.120
all you managers are going to pay rent.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.560
You like nice things? Huh?

14:18.640 --> 14:20.880
Well, you must pay for that.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.360
No more free lunches!

14:22.440 --> 14:25.280
Free lunches for everyone!

14:25.360 --> 14:26.640
[squeals with delight]

14:26.720 --> 14:29.680
Yay! Woo-hoo! [laughs]

14:29.760 --> 14:31.600
Now that sounds great.

14:31.680 --> 14:33.240
There'll be a catch. Trust me.

14:33.320 --> 14:36.240
It does depend whether or not
there's been a client meeting

14:36.320 --> 14:38.440
earlier on in the week and…

14:38.520 --> 14:40.400
well, whether there's leftovers.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.840
[chuckles] Obviously.

14:41.920 --> 14:42.840
[squeals]

14:42.920 --> 14:44.120
[flies buzzing]

14:46.120 --> 14:48.800
Let's look alive. Look alive. Come on.

14:49.560 --> 14:50.720
I'm so sorry.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.560
[woman] A little help here.

14:53.640 --> 14:54.800
Sure.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.400
-Thank you. It's a little heavy.
-[chuckles]

14:58.360 --> 15:01.960
[sighs] Well, when times
get tough, what do we do?

15:02.880 --> 15:04.320
We tighten our belts!

15:04.960 --> 15:06.480
So, as of this week,

15:06.560 --> 15:08.320
you'll all be handing in your laptops

15:08.400 --> 15:11.880
in exchange for these retro babies!

15:11.960 --> 15:13.320
Hey? Pretty cool.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.920
You… You can't be serious.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.240
This is a joke, right? [laughs]

15:18.320 --> 15:22.000
If a company surviving in this economy
is a joke to you, Prince,

15:22.080 --> 15:24.600
then yes, this is a very big joke.

15:25.240 --> 15:26.720
Why don't you write that down?

15:30.040 --> 15:32.840
Now, who can tell me here

15:32.920 --> 15:36.480
how many minutes are there in one hour?

15:37.520 --> 15:40.160
How? A room full of managers,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.160
leaders of this business,

15:42.240 --> 15:44.160
no one can answer such a simple question?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.200
Go.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.680
Uh… [clears throat]

15:51.320 --> 15:53.840
Well, I mean, it's one hour, so…

15:54.800 --> 15:55.920
Sixty minutes.

15:58.360 --> 15:59.600
Lower your chair.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.120
I'm sorry?

16:01.200 --> 16:04.040
I said lower your chair.
You don't deserve to sit in a big chair.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.120
Lower your chair. Now. Now.

16:11.320 --> 16:15.200
No one in this room has a vision. No one.

16:15.280 --> 16:18.800
I'm the only person in this room
that has a vision.

16:19.920 --> 16:20.880
Gugu.

16:23.480 --> 16:24.880
Starting from today,

16:24.960 --> 16:29.480
I'm going to introduce a visionary concept

16:29.560 --> 16:31.640
called "AMI Time".

16:32.840 --> 16:35.840
AMI Time is one government hour

16:37.120 --> 16:40.120
plus a 30 minutes bonus.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.440
-[Junior] This is what I told you about…
-[murmuring]

16:44.520 --> 16:47.080
Quieten down, everyone. Uh, quiet, please.

16:48.120 --> 16:51.600
I would like you all to meet Brian.

16:52.920 --> 16:55.760
Come here, Brian. Come along.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.120
That's my jacket.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.320
What?

16:58.400 --> 17:00.240
-Dude's wearing my jacket.
-Yeah?

17:00.320 --> 17:05.320
[straining] We found Brian
on the side of the road this morning.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.720
We… [wheezes]

17:07.800 --> 17:10.680
We actually thought he was dead. [laughs]

17:10.760 --> 17:11.600
Oh.

17:12.160 --> 17:13.360
But the fact is,

17:13.960 --> 17:17.880
he would still
be able to do most of your jobs.

17:18.400 --> 17:22.080
The Finance department is not really
the most popular department.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.840
It turns out 86% of your colleagues

17:23.920 --> 17:26.240
don't even remember
a single one of your names.

17:26.960 --> 17:29.560
Which is why we've come up with these.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.400
Thank you, Colleen.

17:31.920 --> 17:33.720
Name tags. Look at them.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.200
Okay, they're quite visible.

17:35.280 --> 17:38.080
But maybe it's also
about the placement of your name tag.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.000
You can put it right in the middle.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.040
Or on this side. Or perhaps on that side.

17:43.120 --> 17:46.040
Also, try giving yourself a fun nickname.

17:46.120 --> 17:48.040
So that people find you relatable.

17:48.640 --> 17:49.520
Yes?

17:50.120 --> 17:52.160
Um, people like to call me "Knobface."

17:52.240 --> 17:54.720
I'm not exactly sure why.

17:56.040 --> 17:57.160
I know why.

17:57.920 --> 18:00.920
So let's not go with that here. Okay?

18:01.000 --> 18:02.880
Can I use your name, please?

18:04.120 --> 18:05.560
No. No, no, no.

18:05.640 --> 18:07.600
We want your colleagues
to get to know you.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.200
To find you exciting.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.520
What's your name?

18:10.600 --> 18:12.520
[whispering] Sean. Sean…

18:13.440 --> 18:15.080
Sean. Sean.

18:15.920 --> 18:16.840
Carol.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.960
Oh my shit, someone kill me now.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.760
Do you know how long
our waiting list is right now?

18:23.280 --> 18:24.440
Five months.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.520
Five months!

18:25.600 --> 18:29.200
We are losing sales
because we can't keep up with the demand.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.960
Luckily, I… I have a solution.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.960
From now on, every unit we sell

18:44.040 --> 18:47.840
will have 50% Zulcanoid
and 50% cutting agent.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.680
See? Genius.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.720
Okay, I'm sorry. [scoffs]

18:56.920 --> 18:57.920
Is that paint?

18:58.680 --> 19:00.760
I said it's "cutting agent".

19:00.840 --> 19:02.560
Okay, well, you can't do that.

19:02.640 --> 19:03.840
And why not?

19:03.920 --> 19:06.800
The paint will contaminate
the Zulcanoid, making it unstable.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.440
And how do you know that?

19:09.920 --> 19:11.080
Basic chemistry.

19:11.160 --> 19:12.240
Basic chemistry?

19:12.320 --> 19:15.120
Maybe I wouldn't need to do this
if you found us more ground.

19:15.200 --> 19:19.680
We're mining the only known
Zulcanoid deposit on Earth. [scoffs]

19:19.760 --> 19:22.160
It's not exactly easy to find. [laughs]

19:22.240 --> 19:24.320
Do you know what is easy to find, Sam?

19:24.400 --> 19:25.520
What's that?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.400
Geologists.

19:29.920 --> 19:32.760
Which is why the company has decided

19:32.840 --> 19:35.200
you will no longer
be getting your annual bonus.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.520
-What?
-[all grumbling]

19:37.600 --> 19:39.800
Shh. No. Hold on. Let me finish.

19:39.880 --> 19:41.560
It's not all bad news.

19:41.640 --> 19:44.760
Instead of… money,

19:44.840 --> 19:48.840
which, let's be frank, most of you
would just tk-tk-tk away anyway,

19:49.640 --> 19:51.360
the company has decided to give you

19:51.440 --> 19:55.680
this amazing company-branded clothing.

19:55.760 --> 19:59.200
I mean, take a look at this!

19:59.280 --> 20:00.280
Huh!

20:01.040 --> 20:02.120
Hmm?

20:02.200 --> 20:03.400
The survey also indicates

20:03.480 --> 20:05.960
that your colleagues
don't like the way you treat them.

20:06.040 --> 20:09.800
They say you are,
open quote, "sub-human", close quotes.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.920
I know why.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.920
Because you spend all day on spreadsheets.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.400
Maybe all night.

20:16.360 --> 20:19.720
Who can tell me, what is the
most important thing in any business?

20:22.920 --> 20:23.760
Yes.

20:23.840 --> 20:25.640
Sharp pencils.

20:26.520 --> 20:28.720
Do you use sharp pencils
in your everyday job?

20:29.520 --> 20:30.440
No.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.920
Then why would you think
they're most important?

20:33.920 --> 20:36.440
Because the Russians use them in space.

20:37.360 --> 20:38.640
Are you in space right now?

20:39.560 --> 20:41.960
Yes. The work space.

20:43.320 --> 20:44.720
Anyone else?

20:45.960 --> 20:47.360
Anyone else?

20:47.440 --> 20:50.200
Anyone else, please? Anyone else, please?

20:52.040 --> 20:53.000
Yes.

20:53.080 --> 20:55.200
-What about pens?
-Damn it!

20:56.400 --> 20:57.520
Customers!

20:57.600 --> 21:01.160
The customer
is the lifeblood of any company. Okay?

21:01.680 --> 21:04.520
You don't know that because
you don't get to see the customer.

21:04.600 --> 21:05.960
We are changing that today.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.640
You will all have your own
personalized customer

21:08.720 --> 21:10.920
that you will take
with you everywhere you go.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.800
You will take
your customer to the kitchen.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.800
You will take your customer to the toilet.

21:14.880 --> 21:17.480
You will take your customer with you.
Are we clear?

21:17.560 --> 21:21.200
Uh, sorry. Uh, Carol.
I am not taking a sex toy to the toilet.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.960
It is not a sex toy! It is a customer.

21:23.040 --> 21:26.280
You will take the customer
with you to the toilet. Every time!

21:26.360 --> 21:28.280
-Do you understand?
-Yes, yes. Okay, I understand.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.640
Wow!

21:33.360 --> 21:35.680
[Carol] And, unfortunately,
we do not have pumps.

21:35.760 --> 21:38.320
So you're going to have to
blow your customer yourself.

21:38.400 --> 21:41.440
Just be careful where you put your mouth.
It can be very confusing.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.520
Uh…

21:46.000 --> 21:47.400
[Prince] You know what I don't get?

21:47.480 --> 21:49.320
Why'd he leave Melusi in charge?

21:49.400 --> 21:52.200
Come on, dude. It's his son.
What else was he supposed to do?

21:52.280 --> 21:53.760
He could've given it to Sam.

21:53.840 --> 21:55.440
Shit, I'd even do a better job.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.920
You're a junior accountant
carrying a sex doll around.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.800
-I don't think you've got what it takes.
-You think you do?

22:00.880 --> 22:02.760
-You don't even balls to ask Portia out.
-Whoa.

22:02.840 --> 22:05.160
-I think I know what he's doing.
-Who?

22:05.920 --> 22:08.680
Melusi. He's cutting costs.

22:08.760 --> 22:12.360
Trying to make it look like
AMI is more profitable than what it is.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.480
Why would he do that?

22:13.560 --> 22:15.000
To jack up the price. Right?

22:15.960 --> 22:18.080
You think he wants to sell the company?

22:18.800 --> 22:20.680
There's only one way to find out.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.720
I'll ask him.

22:22.800 --> 22:24.320
-Ask him?
-Yeah.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.120
You do realize he hates you, right?

22:26.200 --> 22:28.120
Like, on a biblical level.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.280
It doesn't matter.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.960
I just have to figure out
what buttons to push.

22:33.040 --> 22:35.280
Okay, well, just don't
push the button that says,

22:35.360 --> 22:36.520
"Punch Sam in the Head."

22:36.600 --> 22:38.840
Because you will lose that fight. Badly.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.080
It'd be like a rhino stomping on a frog.

22:42.160 --> 22:44.440
Except the frog's already,
like, diabetic and shit.

22:44.520 --> 22:47.160
Like, in a wheelchair,
and it can't even hop--

-Oh! Hello, Sam.
-Hey, Gugu.

23:00.920 --> 23:02.200
How are you?

23:02.280 --> 23:05.280
Hey, I'm fine. Thank you.
Uh, you've got a…

23:05.360 --> 23:07.880
-Uh, oh. [sniffs] Oh, thanks!
-You got a… Yeah.

23:07.960 --> 23:11.520
It's, uh… medical powder for my allergies.

23:11.600 --> 23:14.200
Yeah, that's not what I was talking about.
Uh, never mind.

23:14.280 --> 23:15.560
Is he available?

23:15.640 --> 23:17.040
Oh, he's about to pop out.

23:17.120 --> 23:19.120
Pop out? [chuckles]

23:19.200 --> 23:24.000
All right, well I'm just going to grab it.
Grab him! Grab him. Excuse me.

Hey. Hey!

23:44.240 --> 23:45.680
I need to talk to you.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.280
I didn't realize
that you're the one in charge now. Huh?

23:50.360 --> 23:51.800
So what can I do for you, boss?

23:52.480 --> 23:55.600
Look, you've been here for what?
A couple of months?

23:55.680 --> 23:57.360
I've been here since day one.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.560
I just need to know whether
you're going to sell the company.

24:01.880 --> 24:02.840
Who told you that?

24:03.640 --> 24:04.920
You did, actually.

24:05.000 --> 24:07.120
I mean, you've been
cutting corners everywhere.

-Hey! Hey! Hey!

24:21.840 --> 24:23.440
I'm the one who's in charge here.

24:23.520 --> 24:26.120
Me! I'll do whatever I like here.

24:26.200 --> 24:28.400
If you had a little bit
more respect for your father

24:28.480 --> 24:29.840
and what he's done here, you--

24:29.920 --> 24:32.160
My father? My father?

24:32.240 --> 24:34.240
Who are you to talk to me about my father?

24:34.840 --> 24:37.240

25:12.600 --> 25:13.960
-Where is she?
-In her room.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.880
-All right.

-[knocking]
-Hey, Princess.

25:25.120 --> 25:27.280
Dad, I'm 15.
You've gotta stop calling me that.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.320
I know. I'm sorry.

25:28.400 --> 25:30.760
I'm sorry. How're you doing?

25:30.840 --> 25:32.320
Are you… are you in any pain?

25:32.400 --> 25:34.920
As I told Mom, I'm fine.
I can barely feel it.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
Okay.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.840
Well, uh, do you mind if I take a look?

That's, uh… That's not that bad. Right?

25:47.240 --> 25:48.720

-Yeah.

I mean, the way your mom
was going on on the phone,

25:51.200 --> 25:54.120
you'd swear it was a seven… or an eight.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.360
It's nowhere near an eight.
It's like a four.

25:58.560 --> 25:59.480
Right.

26:00.120 --> 26:03.880
Well, if I knew that,
I would've stopped off at the bar,

26:03.960 --> 26:05.280
picked up a couple shotskis.

26:05.360 --> 26:06.520
You? Shots?

26:06.600 --> 26:08.840
Hey. There's a lot about me
you don't know. Okay?

26:08.920 --> 26:11.160
I am capable of stuff.

26:11.240 --> 26:12.680
-Really?
-Girl…

26:12.760 --> 26:13.960
[laughs]

26:14.880 --> 26:18.080
Want me to call your mom? To…

26:18.160 --> 26:20.240
Seriously?
I don't need help putting on cream.

Dad?

Mm! Right. Right. I'm cramping your style.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.520
Mm.

26:33.000 --> 26:36.760
Well, uh… I'll let you get to it, then.

Okay.

-Hey, Dad?
-Yeah? Yeah?

You know, pretty standard.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.160
I suppose it's my fault?

What are you talking about?

27:42.520 --> 27:44.720
You've been spoiled your whole life.

27:45.440 --> 27:47.600
Now you can't face
having to work for a living.

27:47.680 --> 27:49.520
It's not working I have a problem with.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.000
It's being an accountant.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.920
You know, I don't get it.

27:53.400 --> 27:55.200
What's so wrong with being a paramedic?

27:56.200 --> 27:59.040
You don't have the stomach
to work on the front line.

27:59.560 --> 28:00.800
You're a coward.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.080
Always have been.

I… I was a nervous kid.

Yes, I'll give you that. But…

Just please leave my shit alone.

We're not proud of what happened.

some cooking lessons.

Oh, that's a good idea.

Okay. I'm sorry that
my cooking isn't up to your standards.

We are exceptionally busy during the day.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.000
You're both unemployed.

29:45.080 --> 29:46.560
That is not true.

29:46.640 --> 29:48.400
-And not fair.
-And you know it.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.160
I'll have you know
that we do a lot around here.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.560
Like?

29:52.640 --> 29:54.760
Well, for starters, uh, meditating.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.240
Every morning we make sure

29:56.320 --> 29:59.120
that there is clean energy
in all the rooms.

30:18.960 --> 30:19.920
in my room?

30:20.000 --> 30:23.400
That's not the point. The point is
that we do more than our fair share.

30:23.480 --> 30:24.360
Way more.

30:24.440 --> 30:25.640

who sorts it out?

30:37.480 --> 30:39.440
Not you, that's for sure.
You're never here.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.080
You come and go as you please.

30:41.160 --> 30:43.600

-Yeah!

34:41.600 --> 34:42.560
[man] Howdy!

34:44.040 --> 34:46.160
Come talk to your people.
Talk to your people.

34:50.040 --> 34:51.800
[with Australian accent] Well, hello, AMI.

34:51.880 --> 34:53.520
Yeah, hello.

34:54.400 --> 34:58.280
I can't tell you how excited we all are

34:58.360 --> 35:01.400
to finally see you all in the flesh!

35:01.480 --> 35:03.840
Yeah! The fleshy flesh!

35:04.560 --> 35:06.560
Now, before we go any further,

35:06.640 --> 35:09.320
I want to make one thing very clear.

35:10.040 --> 35:13.880
And that is that we are not
planning on making any major changes.

35:14.520 --> 35:16.320
No job cuts. No demotions.

35:16.400 --> 35:18.680
No downsizing of any sort.

35:18.760 --> 35:20.240
You can all rest easy.

35:20.320 --> 35:21.800
Can I get a bloody "Hallelujah?"

35:21.880 --> 35:24.280
[all cheering]

35:24.880 --> 35:26.120
-Yeah!
-Yes!

35:26.200 --> 35:27.680
[laughs]

35:29.320 --> 35:32.200
We will worry about
all of that shit next month!

35:32.920 --> 35:34.920
That's it. I'm homeless.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.120
So now, as you know,

35:36.200 --> 35:39.800
Melusi is going to be stepping out,
and I'm going to be stepping in.

35:39.880 --> 35:40.800
Uh…

35:40.880 --> 35:44.240
Badrick over here
is going to be my second-in-command.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.360
And the beautiful Anya
will be our new Change Manager.

35:47.440 --> 35:51.280
Even though, like I've just said,
you've got nothing to worry about at all.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.320
For now.

35:52.840 --> 35:56.920
Now, this is usually the time,
I suppose, when your new leader,

35:57.000 --> 35:58.280
your new chief,

35:58.360 --> 36:01.920
bores you to death
with his galaxy of achievements.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.000
[laughter]

36:04.080 --> 36:07.480
But instead I'm going to open the floor
to my lovely colleagues

36:07.560 --> 36:09.560
to have a word with you beautiful people.

36:09.640 --> 36:11.520
I think Badrick, you first.

36:12.040 --> 36:13.840
Uh, spoiler warning,

36:13.920 --> 36:15.320
he's a bit intense.

36:15.400 --> 36:16.560
[scattered laughter]

36:21.080 --> 36:23.840
[with Jamaican accent] There are
three things you need to know about me.

36:23.960 --> 36:27.200
One, I don't take shit from nobody!

36:28.680 --> 36:30.960
And two, you romp wid mi,

36:31.040 --> 36:32.800
and I'm gonna mash you up!

36:34.240 --> 36:36.080
Three, no matter what…

36:36.160 --> 36:37.880
I always come out on top.

36:38.840 --> 36:41.920
And if you leave me stranded
on Jamrock with no food…

36:42.000 --> 36:43.320
everything irie.

36:44.040 --> 36:45.840
Because Badrick will feast on himself.

36:45.920 --> 36:49.120
I'm sorry.
Did he just say he'd eat himself?

36:49.200 --> 36:50.680
[man] Thank you, Baddy!

36:50.760 --> 36:52.960
Yeah, Badrick, ladies and gentlemen.

36:53.040 --> 36:55.040
But he has a heart of gold.

36:55.120 --> 36:57.800
Yeah, he can light up the darkest room.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.760
No, really. Yeah.
All right, thanks, Baddy.

37:00.840 --> 37:04.080
Next up we have the lovely Anya.

37:04.160 --> 37:06.160
[scattered applause]

37:08.120 --> 37:10.400
[with Russian accent] So. What is change?

37:11.760 --> 37:13.160
Put your hand down.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.000
Is change when we birth

37:17.640 --> 37:21.680
small uterus, slimy lizard

37:22.560 --> 37:23.920
into baby?

37:24.600 --> 37:25.720
Who knows?

37:26.280 --> 37:30.520
Because change is very mysterious. Hmm?

37:32.480 --> 37:33.440
Thank you.

37:33.520 --> 37:37.400
Anya, thank you so much.
You really raise a valid point there.

37:38.160 --> 37:42.480
Change, guys, is so… mysterious.

37:44.520 --> 37:47.320
All right, that's it.
Let's all get back to work.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.120
We need more of that Zulcanoid.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.360
[chuckles]

37:50.440 --> 37:52.080
That's a bloody order!

37:53.240 --> 37:55.320
[laughs]

37:55.400 --> 37:56.880
Just playing, silly buggers!

37:57.560 --> 37:59.000
Oh, yeah. Gotcha.

37:59.080 --> 38:02.000
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
But seriously, let's go. Come on.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.520
Yeah! Let's go!

38:04.360 --> 38:06.440
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Anya] Bye-bye.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.840
[boss] There's some jelly
in the canteen. Come on.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.240
-[man laughing]
-What the hell was that?

38:11.880 --> 38:13.720
Still think this is a good idea?

38:19.920 --> 38:22.520
[Sam] <i>However bad</i>
<i>we thought it was going to be,</i>

38:22.600 --> 38:23.920
<i>we were wrong.</i>

38:25.480 --> 38:26.800
<i>Way wrong.</i>

38:29.240 --> 38:30.400
Fuck.

38:30.480 --> 38:33.360
[melancholy music playing]

38:41.200 --> 38:42.480
[exhales deeply]

38:44.000 --> 38:45.520
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:52.480 --> 38:53.440
Mmm.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.800
[cell phone buzzing]

39:09.280 --> 39:12.200
Based on some budgetary challenges,

39:12.720 --> 39:16.440
we will no longer be
issuing you with any weapons.

39:17.240 --> 39:21.840
Instead, we will provide you with
something far more valuable.

39:22.840 --> 39:25.600
The ability to fight off intruders

39:25.680 --> 39:27.920
by only using your instincts,

39:28.440 --> 39:29.680
your training,

39:30.520 --> 39:33.560
and some basic office supplies.

39:34.480 --> 39:39.560
So our special guest today
is Sensei Storm Force.

39:39.640 --> 39:42.880
The inventor of
the world's most mixed martial art,

39:42.960 --> 39:44.680
KMKJ.

39:44.760 --> 39:48.720
Or rather "Krav Maga Karate Jujutsu.".

39:49.960 --> 39:51.080
Sensei.

39:55.000 --> 39:59.920
Krav Maga Karate Jujutsu
is all about flow.

40:01.600 --> 40:04.520
About using the tools
around you to shift energy.

40:05.240 --> 40:06.360
And to attack!

40:07.840 --> 40:12.080
Now… is this a stapler or…

40:12.840 --> 40:13.880
jaws of death?

40:14.800 --> 40:16.960
I'm pretty sure that's just a stapler.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.880
Yeah, it's a stapler. Ah, this guy.

40:18.960 --> 40:22.000
We don't need Krav Maga Jujutsu Karate.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.880
Just be awake. And focus. Foo!

40:23.960 --> 40:25.040
Shut it!

40:29.080 --> 40:30.880
Reading is not really my thing.

40:31.520 --> 40:34.040
-Just give it to me straight.
-[Colleen] Well, he's always late.

40:34.120 --> 40:37.200
He lies all the time.
He has a terrible attitude.

40:37.280 --> 40:39.960
Basically, he's the worst staff member
we've ever had.

40:40.040 --> 40:42.640
So if him that bad, why him still here?

40:42.720 --> 40:44.200
Why you don't get rid of him?

40:44.280 --> 40:46.080
I wish we could. Believe me.

40:46.160 --> 40:48.400
But his father
is one of our biggest clients,

40:48.480 --> 40:50.480
and I really don't want to rock that boat.

40:50.560 --> 40:51.880
So what you want to do?

40:52.800 --> 40:55.400
I mean… I could work him over.

40:56.160 --> 40:57.720
Break a few bones.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.200
Slice off some skin.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.240
You… you can do that?

41:03.320 --> 41:04.320
Yeah, man.

41:04.400 --> 41:07.480
That is very tempting, but…

41:08.200 --> 41:11.240
But I actually had
a slightly different idea.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.480
Hmm. Okay. Tell me about it.

41:15.400 --> 41:17.520
Well, I thought that we could, uh…

41:18.360 --> 41:19.680
move him.

41:19.760 --> 41:24.480
You know? Give him
the kind of soul-crushing job

41:24.560 --> 41:27.840
that just completely
destroys him. You know?

41:27.920 --> 41:34.920
Make his days just slow,
painful, psychological torture.

41:35.600 --> 41:37.600
Yeah! Yeah, man.

41:40.280 --> 41:43.160
Do what you want. Me don't give a shit.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.760
Whoa! Me give a shit!

41:48.840 --> 41:50.320
I give a shit!

41:50.400 --> 41:54.320
Also, you were joking about
the slicing thing, right?

41:54.840 --> 41:56.760
And just to clarify,

41:58.360 --> 42:00.360
what did you mean about torture?

42:03.280 --> 42:05.280
-Where is he?
-I'm sorry, what?

42:05.360 --> 42:07.040
Gregory. Where's Gregory?

42:07.120 --> 42:08.880
-Right over here.
-Right over there.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.040
Hello, mate.

42:11.600 --> 42:13.200
You can't cancel the medical aid.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.320
People rely on that. I rely on that!

42:15.400 --> 42:18.520
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Steady there, sailor. Batten that hatch.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.400
Okay, so now, it's, uh…

42:20.480 --> 42:21.880
Wait a minute, don't tell me.

42:22.920 --> 42:23.760
Sam.

42:23.840 --> 42:25.800
Sam! Sammy! Yeah, Sammy. Okay.

42:25.880 --> 42:27.600
So, let's start that over,

42:27.680 --> 42:30.880
but maybe this time,
without the death stare. Okay?

42:30.960 --> 42:32.440
[Gregory and Anya chuckle]

42:32.520 --> 42:34.480
So, what's the big emergency?

42:34.560 --> 42:38.160
My daughter is on some
very expensive medication

42:38.240 --> 42:40.720
that I can't afford
without the medical aid. Okay?

42:40.800 --> 42:43.040
-Oh…
-Gotcha! Okay. Yeah.

42:43.120 --> 42:47.720
All right. But I'm afraid
we don't really have a choice.

42:47.800 --> 42:50.920
It was a part of our agreement
with your former leader. So…

42:51.000 --> 42:53.280
So… change the deal.

42:55.160 --> 42:58.120
Well, now wait a minute.
Wait a bloody minute.

42:58.760 --> 43:02.200
Oh, I've just been
reading up on natural therapies.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.080
Yeah? And did you know it is incredible

43:05.160 --> 43:09.440
what you can make
just by boiling a few plants together.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.160
Did you know that? It is crazy!

43:12.240 --> 43:14.240
And, you want to know something else?

43:14.320 --> 43:18.280
You can probably find everything
that you need in your own forest.

43:18.360 --> 43:19.760
[laughs] Oh yeah!

43:19.840 --> 43:21.160
Now I'd say that's a win.

43:21.240 --> 43:23.040
No. No, no, no!

43:23.600 --> 43:25.760
These are sophisticated drugs! Okay?

43:25.840 --> 43:28.960
You can't just make them
with fucking plants!

43:29.040 --> 43:29.880
Boil.

43:29.960 --> 43:31.120
You gotta boil them.

43:32.280 --> 43:34.400
Now, before I can teach you anything,

43:34.480 --> 43:37.520
I need to know
exactly what I am dealing with.

43:38.840 --> 43:40.240
Any volunteers?

43:41.760 --> 43:42.720
[shuffling]

43:43.200 --> 43:44.800
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

43:44.880 --> 43:47.080
-What's your name?
-Sorry, no. I wasn't volunteering.

43:47.160 --> 43:49.120
-He was being a dick.
-[manager] His name's Junior.

43:49.200 --> 43:51.840
And he will be volunteering. Won't he?

43:51.920 --> 43:53.640
Yes. Lovely.

43:53.720 --> 43:55.760
-[clapping]
-[cheering]

43:55.840 --> 43:58.760
[Storm Force] Come on.
Don't be shy. Please come forward.

44:01.680 --> 44:04.640
Oh, Prince, Prince,
Princey Prince, Prince.

44:05.360 --> 44:06.760
This is long overdue.

44:06.840 --> 44:08.560
You realize it's all your fault?

44:09.280 --> 44:10.520
What is this?

44:10.600 --> 44:13.320
That is a schedule, Einstein.

44:14.600 --> 44:16.080
Yeah, but for what?

44:16.760 --> 44:17.960
For the toilet.

44:18.040 --> 44:19.840
Since you love them so much,

44:19.920 --> 44:22.960
you are going to be timing people.

44:23.040 --> 44:26.320
Uh, I'm sorry?
Timing people in the toilet?

44:26.400 --> 44:27.640
Exactly.

44:27.720 --> 44:31.520
Do you have any idea
how much productivity is lost

44:31.600 --> 44:33.240
when people go for a loo break?

44:33.320 --> 44:35.560
Please. Please.
I'm begging. Don't do this.

44:35.640 --> 44:37.640
I'm sorry? Are you too good for this job?

44:37.720 --> 44:40.440
No! No, no, no, it's not that.
It's just that, um…

44:41.440 --> 44:43.680
I'm still part
of the Finance department, right?

44:43.760 --> 44:44.920
No, of course not!

44:45.000 --> 44:46.760
Now you're part of Facilities,

44:46.840 --> 44:51.640
but your time sheets still come to me,
so do not fuck them up!

44:51.720 --> 44:54.120
Okay, look. I don't care. I'll do the job.

44:54.200 --> 44:56.680
If you take me out of
the Finance department, I will…

44:57.520 --> 44:59.320
I will lose my entire trust fund.

45:00.120 --> 45:00.960
What?

45:01.040 --> 45:01.880
Yeah.

45:01.960 --> 45:04.120
-Your entire trust fund?
-All of it!

45:04.200 --> 45:05.200
I had no idea.

45:05.280 --> 45:07.360
Yeah, it's pretty stupid if you ask me.

45:10.920 --> 45:11.840
[scoffs]

45:11.920 --> 45:15.200
[laughing]

45:15.280 --> 45:18.160
Your entire trust fund? That's amazing.

45:18.920 --> 45:21.000
You made my day.

45:21.640 --> 45:22.920
Oh, shit.

45:23.000 --> 45:25.560
So… do I stay here?

45:25.640 --> 45:26.920
[Anya] <i>Do not be stressed.</i>

45:27.000 --> 45:30.320
I think you are experiencing some change.
So why don't you sit down,

45:30.400 --> 45:32.560
and we can talk about how you feel? Okay?

45:32.640 --> 45:34.720
How I feel? Is she being--

45:34.800 --> 45:36.680
Are you being for real, right now?

45:36.760 --> 45:39.440
We are talking about
my daughter's life here!

45:39.520 --> 45:42.000
Yeah, we know because you already told us.

45:42.080 --> 45:46.360
[laughing] You bloody bugger!
He's trying to fool us!

45:46.440 --> 45:48.040
[Gregory laughs]

45:48.120 --> 45:49.880
All right. [scoffs]

45:51.120 --> 45:54.080
Clearly, you guys think
that this is some kind of joke, huh?

45:54.160 --> 45:55.360
This is funny?

45:55.440 --> 45:57.400
Well, see if this is funny, okay?

45:57.480 --> 45:59.920
How about I see you in court?

46:00.000 --> 46:01.120
-Court?
-Yeah.

46:02.600 --> 46:05.240
I don't like the sound of that at all.

46:06.280 --> 46:08.160
[sighs] I'll tell you what.

46:08.240 --> 46:11.440
How about we don't see you at all anymore?

46:11.520 --> 46:12.640
Because you're fired.

46:13.480 --> 46:15.600
[imitating explosion]

46:17.560 --> 46:19.440
Now that felt bloody amazing!

46:19.520 --> 46:22.440
You see, sudden change,
like explosion in the action movie.

46:22.520 --> 46:24.840
Would you shut the fuck up
about change? Just--

46:27.000 --> 46:28.040
You know what?

46:28.680 --> 46:29.720
This isn't over.

46:32.600 --> 46:35.520
[Gregory]
That's the spirit, Sammy! This isn't over!

46:35.600 --> 46:36.920
Yeah!

46:37.000 --> 46:38.320
[laughs]

46:38.400 --> 46:41.400
Now, I thought Sammy was a girl's name?

46:43.440 --> 46:44.640
You may pick anything.

46:48.320 --> 46:49.440
[Junior] Uh, okay.

46:51.160 --> 46:52.880
It's mightier than the sword.

46:52.960 --> 46:54.560
No. It definitely isn't.

46:55.720 --> 46:58.400
Do you know what a sword is, sir?

46:58.480 --> 47:00.520
Of course I know what a sword is.

47:00.600 --> 47:02.480
It's okay. It's okay, dumb-dumb.

47:02.560 --> 47:05.360
I've trained squirrel
to sniff out landmines.

47:06.000 --> 47:07.240
You can do this.

47:07.320 --> 47:09.000
Now, shall we begin?

47:09.080 --> 47:10.440
Uh, sorry. Um…

47:10.520 --> 47:12.200
Sorry, what are the goggles for?

47:12.280 --> 47:13.800
Focus. Focus!

47:13.880 --> 47:16.480
One day this could be
a life or death situation.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.800
Now I need you to think of your weapon

47:18.880 --> 47:21.120
and how you can use it
to protect yourself.

47:21.200 --> 47:22.760
To protect myself from what?

47:23.400 --> 47:24.680
From this!

47:24.760 --> 47:25.920
Whoa! Whoa!

47:26.000 --> 47:28.640
Wait! Okay? Uh…
Maybe someone else can volunteer instead?

47:28.720 --> 47:30.240
No, relax. Relax.

47:30.320 --> 47:32.560
It's only a simulation.
You'll hardly feel a thing.

47:32.640 --> 47:34.000
That's not true. Come on!

47:34.080 --> 47:35.480
[rapid shots]

47:35.560 --> 47:38.320
Fuck! [grunting] Sh… Ah!

47:38.400 --> 47:39.360
Ah! Stop!

47:39.440 --> 47:40.800
[Storm Force] Protect yourself!

47:40.880 --> 47:43.360
Use your other senses!
You don't need your eyes.

47:43.440 --> 47:45.080
What the fuck, man? It's just a pen!

47:45.160 --> 47:46.360
It's not just a pen!

47:46.440 --> 47:48.560
-It's whatever you need it to be!
-[Junior] Shit!

47:48.640 --> 47:51.000
-[gun fires]
-Ah! Fuck, fuck! Ah!

47:51.080 --> 47:53.040
[grunts] Shit!

47:53.120 --> 47:55.520
[giggling]

47:58.800 --> 48:00.640
You're such an embarrassment.

48:00.720 --> 48:04.240
I'm cutting your hours
to three shifts a week.

48:05.800 --> 48:07.120
[chuckles]

48:14.000 --> 48:15.200
[door opens]

48:18.160 --> 48:19.040
Sean?

48:19.120 --> 48:20.520
Hey, Prince.

48:21.960 --> 48:25.600
Wow, that's a really nice watch.

48:25.680 --> 48:26.600
Can I touch it?

48:26.680 --> 48:28.040
You know what?

48:28.120 --> 48:32.400
Actually, I'm the only one
authorized to handle it.

48:32.480 --> 48:33.640
And it's not a watch.

48:33.720 --> 48:34.960
Then what is it?

48:35.040 --> 48:37.160
-It's a stop watch.
-Isn't that a watch?

48:37.240 --> 48:39.480
For fuck's sake!
Please just go to your desk.

48:39.560 --> 48:40.640
Okay.

48:42.440 --> 48:44.280
Fucking knobface!

48:45.240 --> 48:47.480
I'm not going to wait in, um…

48:57.960 --> 48:59.960
Okay, Patrick. On your marks.

49:00.040 --> 49:02.120
Get set. And… go.

49:04.880 --> 49:06.000
[car lock chirps]

49:13.080 --> 49:14.400
Unbelievable.

49:16.360 --> 49:19.680
Playing around with people's lives?
Thinking that's a joke?

49:19.760 --> 49:21.200
You think that's a joke? Think…

49:22.840 --> 49:23.880
[seatbelt clicks]

49:24.560 --> 49:25.600
[vehicle starts]

49:25.680 --> 49:28.360
We'll see. We'll see.

49:28.440 --> 49:31.000
[phone ringing]

49:31.080 --> 49:32.240
[sighs]

49:33.120 --> 49:34.000
Damn it.

49:34.080 --> 49:35.720
[ringing continues]

49:37.520 --> 49:38.360
[beeps]

49:38.440 --> 49:40.120
Hey, you.

49:40.200 --> 49:42.480
[Rosemary]
<i>Hey, baby. How's your day going?</i>

49:42.560 --> 49:45.120
Oh, you know. Pretty normal.

49:46.280 --> 49:47.560
<i>Are you in your car?</i>

49:48.720 --> 49:49.680
Uh…

49:50.160 --> 49:53.680
Yeah. Yeah, I, um… I finished early.

49:53.760 --> 49:55.600
Thought I'd surprise you.

49:55.680 --> 49:57.160
[Rosemary] <i>Oh, that's nice.</i>

49:57.240 --> 49:59.080
<i>Would you mind stopping at the pharmacy?</i>

49:59.160 --> 50:00.880
<i>Lebo's almost out of tablets.</i>

50:01.520 --> 50:03.680
Is she? Um…

50:03.760 --> 50:05.280
Yeah. Yeah, um…

50:05.800 --> 50:07.240
No problem. I'll…

50:08.480 --> 50:09.600
I'll see you soon.

50:10.120 --> 50:11.880
[Rosemary] <i>Okay. Love you.</i>

50:12.640 --> 50:13.800
Love you too.

50:13.880 --> 50:14.880
[phone beeps off]

50:15.680 --> 50:17.040
Fuck!

50:17.920 --> 50:20.840
[melancholy music playing]

50:21.720 --> 50:22.720
[sighs deeply]

50:26.000 --> 50:27.120
Fuck.

50:37.920 --> 50:38.760
[scoffs]

50:45.120 --> 50:48.120
You shouldn't have done that.
What if Zepler casts a frozen spell?

50:48.200 --> 50:50.760
He can't.
I picked up Grindol's shield, remember?

50:50.840 --> 50:52.040
Just try to keep up.

50:52.120 --> 50:53.400
[man] That's right. Sorry. Sorry.

50:53.480 --> 50:56.400
-[woman] As long as you've got my back.
-[man] Don't you worry about that.

51:00.240 --> 51:02.560
Where'd you guys get money
to buy a new video game?

51:02.640 --> 51:03.640
Shh!

51:12.400 --> 51:13.280
Hey, guys?

51:14.120 --> 51:15.040
Where's the fridge?

51:15.120 --> 51:17.200
[woman] Shh! Quiet! Please!

51:21.040 --> 51:22.600
-[glass shatters]
-Hey!

51:23.760 --> 51:27.120
Please tell me you didn't sell
the fridge to buy a fucking video game!

51:27.200 --> 51:28.480
Dude, language!

51:28.560 --> 51:30.600
We don't go around
swearing about your job.

51:30.680 --> 51:32.080
We would never do that.

51:32.160 --> 51:34.560
Dressing up like idiots
and playing video games

51:34.640 --> 51:37.000
isn't a fucking job!

51:37.080 --> 51:38.800
You're both such losers!

51:38.880 --> 51:40.520
[dramatic music playing]

51:40.600 --> 51:43.120
I believe that our honor
has been challenged.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.560
I believe it has.

51:44.640 --> 51:47.160
-You know what that means, my love?
-What's it mean, babe?

51:47.240 --> 51:48.080
[chainmail rattling]

51:48.160 --> 51:53.600
It means I'm going to smite him
with yonder broadsword!

51:54.880 --> 51:55.720
Um…

51:56.200 --> 51:58.280
Let's… Let's calm down.

51:58.360 --> 52:00.200
Just put the sword down, Harry. Please.

52:00.280 --> 52:04.240
You will have to pry it
from my cold, dead fingers.

52:04.320 --> 52:06.200
-Oh, shit.
-Arm yourself.

52:09.040 --> 52:11.640
-[woman chuckles]
-Now battle is joined.

52:12.400 --> 52:14.480
Oh, shit! [grunts]

52:14.560 --> 52:16.160
[Harry] Come back here!

52:16.240 --> 52:17.880
To the halls of Valhalla!

52:17.960 --> 52:20.080
-Come hither!
-[Junior] Harry, stop. Stop. Please!

52:20.160 --> 52:22.120
-Harry, please!
-Chop off his head!

52:22.200 --> 52:24.320
[Junior]<i> No, stop! Harry!</i>

52:26.880 --> 52:29.000
[Prince] I'm telling you,
the whole place has gone mad.

52:29.080 --> 52:31.720
I mean, who times people
when they're taking a shit?

52:31.800 --> 52:33.280
What if they're constipated?

52:33.360 --> 52:35.040
You can't do that to people.

52:35.120 --> 52:36.200
This can't be legal.

52:36.280 --> 52:38.160
Know what? We need to contact our lawyer.

52:38.240 --> 52:39.400
Get him on the phone--

52:39.480 --> 52:41.600
There's always someone
to blame, isn't there?

52:41.680 --> 52:42.600
What?

52:43.360 --> 52:45.400
Didn't you hear anything I just said?

52:45.480 --> 52:47.160
The deal was five years,

52:47.240 --> 52:48.920
and yet again you've fallen short.

52:49.000 --> 52:50.240
That is not fair.

52:50.320 --> 52:53.000
I never quit. I stuck it out.

52:53.080 --> 52:55.240
You never put in the work.
It was a joke to you!

52:55.320 --> 52:57.200
What did you think was gonna happen?

52:57.280 --> 52:59.880
Come on, Dad. Don't do this to me.

52:59.960 --> 53:01.880
Wake up, boy. You did it to yourself.

53:03.120 --> 53:05.880
Okay, you know what?
I don't have to put up with this.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.520
Well, you could always leave.

53:08.200 --> 53:11.360
I mean, you're only what? Twenty-seven?

53:13.200 --> 53:17.000
Fine. You want me gone? No problem.

53:17.080 --> 53:18.520
Where're you going to go?

53:19.120 --> 53:20.680
I don't know, Dad!

53:20.760 --> 53:22.840
You know what? I don't care.

53:22.920 --> 53:25.200
I will stay in my car if I have to.

53:25.840 --> 53:28.160
Anywhere is better than this place.
You know that?

53:29.640 --> 53:31.000
Stupid chairs!

53:34.760 --> 53:37.000
[clock ticking]

53:58.400 --> 53:59.800
[phone dialing]

53:59.880 --> 54:03.000
Hey, Chen. It's me. Um…

54:03.080 --> 54:05.800
I was wondering if
you're still interested in Zulcanoid?

54:05.880 --> 54:08.640
Um, because if you are,

54:10.320 --> 54:12.960
I think I might be able to make it happen.

54:14.840 --> 54:18.040
So, yeah. Let me know, okay?

54:19.480 --> 54:20.480
Thanks.

54:21.240 --> 54:22.320
[sighs]

54:29.960 --> 54:33.680
[cell phone buzzing]

54:36.600 --> 54:38.040
Hey, Chen. Um…

54:39.200 --> 54:42.520
When I said let me know,
I didn't mean like right now.

54:42.600 --> 54:44.520
I didn't want you to change your mind.

54:44.600 --> 54:46.040
How soon can you get it?

54:46.120 --> 54:48.240
I don't know. A couple of weeks, maybe.

54:48.320 --> 54:49.960
You need to hurry. I'm running outta time.

54:50.040 --> 54:52.000
Yeah, okay. Chen, look.

54:53.400 --> 54:56.240
I really need to know
what you're going to use it for.

54:56.320 --> 54:57.720
Like, for real.

54:57.800 --> 54:59.240
I already told you.

54:59.320 --> 55:03.520
It's for children to help with their
medical equipment for the heart disease.

55:04.160 --> 55:06.400
Uh, I thought you said cancer?

55:06.480 --> 55:09.120
It's for both, okay? Look, Sam…

55:09.200 --> 55:11.920
It's Zulcanoid. Not uranium.

55:12.000 --> 55:14.360
I'm not building a bomb, okay?

55:14.440 --> 55:15.320
[blows]

55:16.080 --> 55:17.040
[sighs]

55:19.000 --> 55:22.160
Yeah, all right. Okay. Fine. Okay.

55:22.240 --> 55:24.520
Good. Now let's talk money.

55:25.040 --> 55:28.880
So we can bring all the girls
to your yard for some fucky-fucky. Huh?

55:36.520 --> 55:38.080
[Junior] You don't know what it's like.

55:38.160 --> 55:41.080
Living with them
is like a recurring nightmare.

55:41.160 --> 55:43.720
In your apartment?
Must be nice having walls.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.040
You know what isn't nice?

55:45.120 --> 55:47.480
Getting beaten up by a pathetic man-child

55:47.560 --> 55:49.320
and having to beg for my life.

55:49.400 --> 55:52.240
But have you wasted
every single day for the past five years,

55:52.320 --> 55:54.040
and now you're completely screwed?

55:54.120 --> 55:56.400
-Oh, your trust fund?
-Oh, dude. Please. No.

55:56.480 --> 55:59.200
I don't think I have one of those.
I'll check with my PA.

55:59.280 --> 56:00.400
-[Prince] You don't.
-Linda?

56:00.480 --> 56:01.800
[Sam] All right. Enough.

56:01.880 --> 56:04.520
Okay?
Everybody's having a shit time. All right?

56:04.600 --> 56:05.720
We get it.

56:05.800 --> 56:08.200
Whining about it
isn't going to change anything.

56:08.280 --> 56:09.440
Then what do you suggest?

56:09.520 --> 56:11.160
Oh, do you really want to know?

56:11.240 --> 56:15.160
I'm living in my car.
So yeah, I would like to know.

56:17.080 --> 56:20.040
Okay. What's the one thing we all need?

56:20.120 --> 56:22.280
That'll make all our problems go away?

56:22.360 --> 56:25.200
I don't know. A shitload of money?

56:25.280 --> 56:26.920
-Yeah.
-Exactly.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.040
And I think…

56:28.960 --> 56:30.880
I think I know how to make that happen.

56:30.960 --> 56:32.880
What? How?

56:34.880 --> 56:37.040
By taking something
that doesn't belong to us.

56:37.120 --> 56:40.160
Come on, Sam.
You've never even had a parking ticket.

56:40.240 --> 56:42.080
And now you want to what? Rob a bank?

56:42.160 --> 56:46.000
No, not rob a bank!
Besides, it wouldn't even be stealing.

56:46.080 --> 56:48.840
It would be taking back
something that we've earned.

56:49.520 --> 56:52.640
Something that
we've dedicated our lives to.

56:52.720 --> 56:53.560
[Prince] Okay.

56:54.400 --> 56:55.880
What are you talking about?

56:59.960 --> 57:03.640
I got an offer for 12 units of Zulcanoid.

57:04.720 --> 57:06.960
-And it's a lot of money.
-How much?

57:07.880 --> 57:08.720
Two million.

57:08.800 --> 57:10.680
What? From who?

57:11.920 --> 57:15.480
It doesn't matter. Just, all
you need to know is that he's legit,

57:15.560 --> 57:18.400
and he's prepared to pay half upfront.

57:18.480 --> 57:20.400
For a dozen units? That's it?

57:20.480 --> 57:21.560
That's it.

57:24.280 --> 57:25.520
[Prince exhales]

57:28.160 --> 57:29.080
Prince.

57:30.760 --> 57:33.280
You know what? I don't care anymore.

57:34.040 --> 57:36.480
It's the least we deserve,
the way they've treated us.

57:37.080 --> 57:38.000
Come on, guys.

57:38.600 --> 57:41.480
I've lived my whole life
going by the rules.

57:41.560 --> 57:42.720
Right?

57:42.800 --> 57:44.760
Sure, what's that gotten me, but…

57:51.560 --> 57:55.920
Okay, well, if they want
to play dirty… so can we, right?

57:56.000 --> 57:57.160
Yes.

57:59.200 --> 58:00.400
[laughs]

58:01.280 --> 58:03.720
Let's do it. Let's do it.

58:03.800 --> 58:05.720
Okay, dude. Keep it down.

58:05.800 --> 58:08.280
-We're doing it. It's done.
-I'm sorry. My God.

58:09.160 --> 58:11.120
Just one thing, though.

58:12.000 --> 58:13.520
We're not criminals.

58:14.200 --> 58:18.400
So we're going to need
some help figuring this out.

58:20.120 --> 58:22.040
Why are you looking at him like that?

58:24.520 --> 58:27.880
Fine! Fine. I know a guy.

58:28.560 --> 58:29.720
Like, a felon?

58:35.080 --> 58:37.560
[Prince] Am I the only one
who thinks this is a really bad idea?

58:37.640 --> 58:39.440
Just calm down, okay?

58:39.520 --> 58:41.760
They're mostly just
regular people with issues.

58:41.840 --> 58:43.120
No big deal.

58:43.200 --> 58:45.880
[man yelling, laughing maniacally]

58:47.160 --> 58:48.760
Regular people? Hmm?

58:48.840 --> 58:49.760
With some issues?

58:49.840 --> 58:51.320
Look, I know he's your dad,

58:51.400 --> 58:54.320
but I don't think we should be
taking advice from a crazy person.

58:54.400 --> 58:56.840
He's not crazy.
His lawyer got him in here, okay?

58:56.920 --> 58:59.320
-It was either this place or jail.
-Okay.

58:59.400 --> 59:01.160
But he knows what he's talking about.

59:01.720 --> 59:03.200
And he's no snitch.

59:08.600 --> 59:12.440
Do not speak to anyone you don't know.
Keep your voice down at all times.

59:12.520 --> 59:15.280
No sudden movement. No whistling.
No singing. No dancing.

59:15.360 --> 59:17.480
And do not accept any offers of food.

59:18.080 --> 59:21.240
Oh. No singing? Such a pity.

59:22.320 --> 59:24.200
Sorry. Um, question.

59:24.280 --> 59:27.760
Have any of your guests
ever been attacked in your experience?

59:29.840 --> 59:31.320
They only attack the weak.

59:31.400 --> 59:33.680
I'm sorry? What?

59:34.640 --> 59:36.880
-Is he joking or…?
-[Sam] Come on. Just go.

59:36.960 --> 59:38.960
[laughter echoing]

59:40.160 --> 59:41.440
[door closes]

59:42.720 --> 59:43.800
[Junior] There he is.

59:44.320 --> 59:45.240
Come on.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.320
[suspenseful music playing]

59:55.880 --> 59:57.920
[banging on table]

59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.480
I want to take out your eyes and eat them!

1:00:00.560 --> 1:00:02.280
Take out your brain and eat it!

1:00:02.360 --> 1:00:05.840
You want to come here?
Come here, man! I'll show you something.

1:00:05.920 --> 1:00:07.440
Ah, you want some?

1:00:07.520 --> 1:00:09.640
Come. Want some of this?

1:00:09.720 --> 1:00:10.680
[clicks tongue]

1:00:11.800 --> 1:00:13.440
Hey, Dad.

1:00:18.280 --> 1:00:19.520
Junior!

1:00:19.600 --> 1:00:21.800
-Hey, Dad.
-What a lovely surprise!

1:00:21.880 --> 1:00:23.240
Come here, son.

1:00:24.360 --> 1:00:26.400
How're you doing? You doing alright, Dad?

1:00:26.480 --> 1:00:27.760
No, I'm fine.

1:00:27.840 --> 1:00:30.600
I'm keeping my head down.
Keeping out of trouble.

1:00:31.360 --> 1:00:32.360
That's great.

1:00:32.440 --> 1:00:33.360
And who are these?

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:35.520
These are my friends.
This is Prince and Sam.

1:00:35.600 --> 1:00:36.520
-Prince!
-Hello.

1:00:36.600 --> 1:00:38.920
-Come here, young man.
-Oh, okay.

1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:42.840
Your hair smells… smells wonderful.
What is it?

1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:44.360
Fear mostly.

1:00:45.680 --> 1:00:48.720
[laughing]

1:00:48.800 --> 1:00:50.480
Funny! I like him.

1:00:50.560 --> 1:00:52.720
Yes. And, um, he's…

1:00:52.800 --> 1:00:55.720
Sam. You're the smart one, aren't you?

1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:57.400
The leader of the pack.

1:00:57.480 --> 1:00:58.760
I can tell these things.

1:00:58.840 --> 1:01:01.680
I'm not really a leader.
Just, we're all friends.

1:01:01.760 --> 1:01:04.600
Friends? Wonderful. Well, anyway.
Let's sit down, gentlemen.

1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:07.640
I assume this isn't a social call?

1:01:07.720 --> 1:01:13.000
I'm guessing that
you young boys need something from me.

1:01:14.120 --> 1:01:17.120
We were hoping
you could give us some advice.

1:01:17.200 --> 1:01:21.400
We need to get our hands on something that

1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:25.160
doesn't completely belong to us.

1:01:25.240 --> 1:01:26.760
-Hello!
-Oh my God!

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:29.640
You want to pat my dog?

1:01:29.720 --> 1:01:33.160
Oh, um… Thank you. But, uh, no, thank you.

1:01:33.240 --> 1:01:35.880
He doesn't bite. I promise.

1:01:35.960 --> 1:01:38.280
He's a good boy. You're a good boy!

1:01:38.360 --> 1:01:39.520
Yeah, it's not that.

1:01:39.600 --> 1:01:43.040
I am just deathly allergic to dogs.

1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:45.320
This is Fingers.

1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:48.440
And he's not gonna go anywhere
unless you pat the dog.

1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:50.360
-Yeah, I'm not doing that.
-Pat the dog.

1:01:50.440 --> 1:01:51.600
-No.
-Pat the dog.

1:01:51.680 --> 1:01:52.920
-No!
-Just pat the damn dog!

1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:54.040
All right, fine!

1:01:54.120 --> 1:01:55.040
[dog squeaks]

1:01:57.640 --> 1:01:59.200
What is his name?

1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:01.200
Little Bit.

1:02:01.280 --> 1:02:04.880
Little Bit? Um, okay.
"Little Bit" of what?

1:02:04.960 --> 1:02:06.360
Mucus.

1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:08.200
-[Prince] Oh my God.
-That means snot.

1:02:08.280 --> 1:02:10.200
-[Sam] Don't let go, Prince.
-Guys, it's wet!

1:02:11.160 --> 1:02:12.640
[Senior] We can carry on.

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:16.240
Fingers here blew his brains
with crystal meth.

1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:19.560
He won't remember
a single thing. So, please.

1:02:20.320 --> 1:02:21.960
Okay. Um…

1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:28.360
If we were trying to lift something
from, like, a warehouse,

1:02:28.440 --> 1:02:30.080
how would we go about that?

1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:32.840
Well, what you'd always need to know.

1:02:32.920 --> 1:02:35.520
The Five Ds.

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:38.560
Define. Delegate. Divert. Disguise.

1:02:38.640 --> 1:02:41.160
And the most important one of them all,

1:02:41.240 --> 1:02:42.960
do not get fucking caught.

1:02:43.800 --> 1:02:44.640
That's it?

1:02:45.280 --> 1:02:46.240
Yeah, pretty much.

1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:47.680
-Oh.
-[dog squeaking]

1:02:48.240 --> 1:02:49.640
Don't stop patting him!

1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:52.800
-Okay.
-He's almost asleep.

1:02:53.920 --> 1:02:58.400
Yeah, I'm so sorry. Um… Sure, sure. Um…

1:02:59.280 --> 1:03:05.720
Question. Hypothetically, what if
we work at the place we're trying to hit?

1:03:05.800 --> 1:03:08.960
Is that, like, a red flag or is it like--

1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:10.880
Oh, no. Not necessarily.

1:03:11.520 --> 1:03:13.920
No. You see, um, say for example,

1:03:14.000 --> 1:03:17.600
if you left your fingerprints
or a sample of hair or whatever.

1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:19.280
They can't hold you to it.

1:03:19.360 --> 1:03:23.360
Simply because, well,
it's like a… a free fuck-up.

1:03:23.440 --> 1:03:26.160
Right. Free fuck-up.

1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.560
Mr. Moses, please,
don't take this the wrong way, but

1:03:30.640 --> 1:03:33.240
you're good at this sort of thing, right?

1:03:35.920 --> 1:03:37.360
[chortling]

1:03:37.440 --> 1:03:39.400
You tell me.

1:03:39.480 --> 1:03:41.600
Wowzers! He is-- You are so good, sir!

1:03:41.680 --> 1:03:43.640
-Oh, thank you.
-[Sam] Seriously?

1:03:43.720 --> 1:03:45.280
-What?
-I'm so sorry.

1:03:45.360 --> 1:03:46.320
You guys smell that?

1:03:46.400 --> 1:03:48.240
[sniffs]

1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:49.400
Did one of you fart?

1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:51.000
Oh, he's done it again.

1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:53.480
[Fingers] It's my special pudding.

1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:56.200
-Oh my God.
-I made it myself. You should try some.

1:03:56.280 --> 1:03:58.120
-Oh my God!
-It's delicious.

1:03:58.200 --> 1:04:00.440
It gives you superpowers.

1:04:01.720 --> 1:04:03.920
Whoo!

1:04:04.000 --> 1:04:06.200
[whoops echoing]

1:04:09.240 --> 1:04:12.240
[tense music playing]

[music continues]

1:05:00.360 --> 1:05:01.400
[sharp inhale]

1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:07.720
[music continues]

1:05:11.720 --> 1:05:13.080
Hey, Doc.

1:05:18.440 --> 1:05:19.560
Thanks.

1:05:22.360 --> 1:05:24.360
[music continues]

1:05:40.800 --> 1:05:43.000
[gasps]

1:05:43.080 --> 1:05:45.760
[muttering, chuckling lightly]

1:05:50.560 --> 1:05:51.920
[old man grumbles]

1:05:58.280 --> 1:06:00.280
[jaunty music playing]

1:06:27.960 --> 1:06:29.760
[indistinct chatter]

1:06:40.400 --> 1:06:41.600
Focus.

1:07:09.760 --> 1:07:10.640
Ugh.

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:40.880
Sorry!

1:07:40.960 --> 1:07:42.520
Uh, sorry. Are you okay?

1:07:42.600 --> 1:07:43.480
I'm fine.

1:07:43.560 --> 1:07:45.240
-Are you sure?
-I'm good. I promise.

1:07:45.320 --> 1:07:47.600
-Okay.
-So? Where's the fire?

1:07:48.200 --> 1:07:51.400
-The fire? Where, uh… What?
-You look like you're in a rush.

1:07:51.480 --> 1:07:53.480
Ah! Oh, um…

1:07:54.800 --> 1:07:57.360
I… Sorry. I just need
to go start my shift.

1:07:58.080 --> 1:08:00.160
Are you all right?
You look a little nervous.

1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:01.400
Nervous?

1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:03.680
That's strange. I feel fine.

1:08:03.760 --> 1:08:05.160
[chuckles] Yeah.

1:08:06.560 --> 1:08:09.200
Oh, um, that's, um… That's a pity.

1:08:10.160 --> 1:08:14.880
I thought… maybe I made you nervous?

1:08:16.920 --> 1:08:19.600
Actually… yes, you do.

1:08:20.680 --> 1:08:23.760
I was just trying
not to make you feel bad about it. Uh…

1:08:24.640 --> 1:08:27.120
But, um… you know what might help?

1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:29.040
-What's that?
-Well…

1:08:29.120 --> 1:08:32.320
Maybe we could, you know,

1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:34.360
spend some more time together.

1:08:34.440 --> 1:08:37.320
That way I wouldn't feel
so nervous around you.

1:08:37.400 --> 1:08:39.280
-If you think it might help?
-I think it might.

1:08:39.360 --> 1:08:41.320
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.400
Uh… Uh…

1:08:44.080 --> 1:08:45.600
-I'll send you a text.
-Perfect.

1:08:45.680 --> 1:08:46.600
-Great.
-Great.

1:08:46.680 --> 1:08:47.720
Right. Great. Ah.

1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:49.400
I've got to get going.

1:08:49.480 --> 1:08:51.080
Got to go punch my cock.

1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:53.120
Punch the clock! Punch the clock. Uh,,,

1:08:53.680 --> 1:08:54.640
Sorry! Excuse me.

1:08:54.720 --> 1:08:56.280
Uh… Okay, bye.

1:08:56.360 --> 1:08:57.800
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:09:02.080 --> 1:09:03.040
[Portia chuckles]

1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:05.120
Sorry.

1:09:07.400 --> 1:09:09.400
[indistinct conversation]

1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:13.000
All right, guys. So?

1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:15.440
When are we doing this?

1:09:15.520 --> 1:09:17.400
I vote Saturday night.
It's the perfect time.

1:09:17.480 --> 1:09:19.360
-Why?
-It's the big game.

1:09:19.440 --> 1:09:22.160
-Everybody's gonna be in the office.
-What about patrols?

1:09:22.240 --> 1:09:24.160
They only need to tag in
every three hours.

1:09:24.240 --> 1:09:25.920
So we'll be good. Trust me.

1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:28.680
You know what would help?
If we got them drunk.

1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:31.400
Yes, but how?

1:09:32.200 --> 1:09:35.400
We could send them
a shitload of beers. Right?

1:09:35.480 --> 1:09:39.520
And a note from management
thanking them for all their hard work.

1:09:39.600 --> 1:09:42.000
Telling them to enjoy the game. Right?

1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:43.440
That could actually work.

1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:46.040
But not everybody's going to get drunk.

1:09:46.120 --> 1:09:48.240
Okay. Sure.

1:09:50.600 --> 1:09:52.600
-We put tranquilizers in the beer!
-What?

1:09:52.680 --> 1:09:55.400
No! No, absolutely not.
I don't want anybody getting hurt.

1:09:55.480 --> 1:09:57.120
Oh, no. No one's gonna get hurt.

1:09:57.200 --> 1:10:00.120
We used to drug my grandmother
all the time. It's perfectly safe.

1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:01.680
What? You drugged your granny?

1:10:01.760 --> 1:10:03.640
Oh, dude, don't start with me, okay?

1:10:03.720 --> 1:10:05.720
You don't know the shit we went through.

1:10:05.800 --> 1:10:10.400
You know she used to shave our heads
while we were sleeping?

1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:12.240
-You want to know why?
-Why?

1:10:12.320 --> 1:10:15.480
I don't know. I'm still asking myself.

1:10:16.040 --> 1:10:17.560
So it'll work.

1:10:17.640 --> 1:10:20.800
They'll be fine. They'll be
sleeping like kittens. Guys, I swear.

1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:25.480
Okay, we can keep it in mind.
But so long as it's safe.

1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:27.800
It will be.

1:10:30.160 --> 1:10:32.120
-All right, so…
-Cool.

1:10:33.400 --> 1:10:34.400
Saturday it is.

1:10:34.480 --> 1:10:36.240
-Saturday!
-[Sam] Perfect.

1:10:36.320 --> 1:10:38.360
-[Junior] Saturday.
-[exhales]

1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:39.440
[Junior snorts]

1:10:39.520 --> 1:10:40.760
[spits]

1:10:42.160 --> 1:10:44.400
If one of us get caught, no snitching.

1:10:44.480 --> 1:10:48.880
A spit oath? Um, I'm not shaking that.

1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:50.520
Come on, man! We need to commit!

1:10:50.600 --> 1:10:53.280
Yeah. No, thanks, man. I'm good.

1:10:53.360 --> 1:10:56.000
Yeah. We really don't need an oath.

1:10:56.080 --> 1:10:58.200
You know? We trust each other. Right?

1:10:58.280 --> 1:10:59.640
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah?

1:11:00.280 --> 1:11:03.480
Fine, okay. I just thought
that we were having a moment.

1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:08.560
No, there was no--
We were not having any moments. Idiot.

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.440
To getting what we deserve.

1:11:13.520 --> 1:11:14.600
To what we deserve.

1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:15.880
Hear! Hear!

1:11:16.480 --> 1:11:19.120
[rock music playing]

1:11:20.040 --> 1:11:21.640
[exhales]

1:11:21.720 --> 1:11:23.880
[rock music continues]

1:11:56.680 --> 1:11:59.040
[thunder rumbling]

1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.280
[Junior on voicemail] <i>Hey Portia.</i>

1:12:15.360 --> 1:12:17.960
<i>I was wondering if maybe</i>
<i>you'd like to have dinner next week?</i>

1:12:18.040 --> 1:12:19.840
<i>I'm even willing to pay half.</i>

1:12:19.920 --> 1:12:21.760
<i>That's a joke. Of course. Okay, thanks.</i>

1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:37.400
[squelching sounds]

1:12:50.720 --> 1:12:52.280
[Portia screams]

1:13:05.440 --> 1:13:06.560
Okay.

1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:09.200
You planning on running
into any ninjas today?

1:13:09.280 --> 1:13:12.160
Look, I would rather just have it
than not have it.

1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:15.040
Why you always got to give me shit?

1:13:15.120 --> 1:13:17.520
-Because you're being ridiculous.
-I am not.

1:13:17.600 --> 1:13:19.720
-I am being prepared.
-Mm-hmm.

1:13:20.440 --> 1:13:23.080
Anyway, what did you bring?
Where's your weapon?

1:13:25.360 --> 1:13:26.600
I'm gonna get some air.

1:13:28.960 --> 1:13:32.320
All right, you know what?
Kill me for being a little nervous.

1:13:32.400 --> 1:13:34.560
Shit is about to go down!

1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:39.000
How can you be so calm?

1:13:39.080 --> 1:13:41.120
[Sam] I'm not.
I'm just focused on the plan.

1:13:41.200 --> 1:13:44.320
Which, in case you've forgotten,
does not include any sword play.

1:13:46.440 --> 1:13:47.880
[Prince] Oh God. What's he carrying?

1:13:47.960 --> 1:13:50.600
I have no idea.

1:13:50.680 --> 1:13:52.080
Hey, guys. We good?

1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:54.520
That really depends
on what's in the giant bag.

1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:55.880
The masks. Remember?

1:13:55.960 --> 1:13:58.760
You need a giant bag for three masks?

1:13:58.840 --> 1:14:02.160
Yes. If you're doing it right.
Check it out.

1:14:04.080 --> 1:14:05.320
What the hell's that?

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:07.480
What? What's wrong with it?

1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:10.800
Nothing. I just didn't realize
we were entering a children's TV show.

1:14:10.880 --> 1:14:12.720
Normal masks aren't good enough! Okay?

1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:15.200
We need to cover our whole heads!

1:14:15.280 --> 1:14:16.680
Just try it on.

1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:23.240
Is there only chicken masks?

1:14:23.320 --> 1:14:24.400
No.

1:14:24.480 --> 1:14:27.440
Oh, great. Yeah, I will just take
one of the other ones. Thanks.

1:14:27.520 --> 1:14:29.360
Okay, fine. Whatever.

1:14:30.400 --> 1:14:32.760
All right, what do we have? Oh motherf--

1:14:32.840 --> 1:14:35.560
-What?
-A fucking unicorn! Seriously?

1:14:35.640 --> 1:14:37.880
-What?
-Why couldn't you get us cool shit?

1:14:37.960 --> 1:14:39.920
Like dead presidents? Right?

1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:43.200
This is the cool shit.
Okay? Just trust me.

1:14:43.280 --> 1:14:45.040
You know what? Just give them to me.

1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:47.360
The masks are fine.

1:14:48.920 --> 1:14:51.680
Could the two of you please focus?

1:14:51.760 --> 1:14:53.760
If we screw this up, it's prison.

1:14:53.840 --> 1:14:54.800
Remember that.

1:14:54.880 --> 1:14:56.720
Yes, of course. Incarceration. I…

1:14:57.680 --> 1:14:59.040
My head's in the game.

1:14:59.120 --> 1:15:00.080
I'm ready. Let's go.

1:15:00.160 --> 1:15:02.280
Yeah, I'm even more ready than that.

1:15:02.360 --> 1:15:04.240
Oh God, I did it again. I'm so sorry.

1:15:06.560 --> 1:15:07.600
[Sam] Move.

1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:10.560
-Shotgun.
-Oh, Junior!

1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:11.760
[sighs]

1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:18.640
Seriously? You never heard of ski-masks?
They're in every heist film you ever seen.

1:15:18.720 --> 1:15:20.800
Know what your problem is?
You're ungrateful.

1:15:20.880 --> 1:15:23.080
-[Sam] Mm.
-No wonder your dad doesn't like you.

1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:27.400
[thunder rumbling]

1:15:34.080 --> 1:15:36.600
[indistinct chatter on TV]

1:15:40.880 --> 1:15:42.880
[suspenseful music playing]

1:16:03.840 --> 1:16:05.800
[snoring]

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.440
Guys, it worked! They're all knocked out.

1:16:11.520 --> 1:16:12.680
Okay, good. Good.

1:16:13.320 --> 1:16:15.720
What about the cameras?
You manage to turn them off?

1:16:15.800 --> 1:16:17.560
Yeah. Hard drive's in my bag.

1:16:17.640 --> 1:16:19.120
I told you it would work.

1:16:19.600 --> 1:16:21.920
One shouldn't throw
the word "genius" around, but…

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:24.920
Yeah, let's not get
ahead of ourselves, all right?

1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:27.120
How's it looking up there?

1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:28.200
Like a ghost town.

1:16:29.520 --> 1:16:31.800
Okay. Uh, I'm on my way.

1:16:44.760 --> 1:16:46.000
[clears throat]

1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:48.880
[scoffs]

1:16:51.640 --> 1:16:52.560
[exhales]

1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:54.240
[thunder rumbling]

1:16:59.000 --> 1:17:01.040
Oh, this is such a tragedy.

1:17:01.800 --> 1:17:04.920
Now, I'm not normally one
to point fingers.

1:17:05.720 --> 1:17:10.000
But I'm fairly sure I told you
not to eat the humans.

1:17:10.080 --> 1:17:13.080
-Why would you think it was me?
-Because it's always you!

1:17:14.040 --> 1:17:15.920
Every time we get on a planet,

1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:18.400
it's the same bloody story.

1:17:18.920 --> 1:17:21.480
The locals slide down your neck!

1:17:21.560 --> 1:17:22.640
It's disgusting!

1:17:22.720 --> 1:17:24.960
You know what? Maybe it was him!

1:17:25.040 --> 1:17:27.160
No, no. No, no. No. It wasn't him

1:17:27.240 --> 1:17:30.360
because he has food allergies,
and you know it.

1:17:30.440 --> 1:17:31.920
[sneezes]

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:35.120
-[muffled yelling]
-[banging]

1:17:35.200 --> 1:17:38.320
Well, I wonder what that could be.

1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:40.760
I don't know. I don't have
mind-reading protocol.

1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:41.920
[low snarl]

1:17:43.160 --> 1:17:45.000
[suspenseful music plays]

1:17:59.600 --> 1:18:01.000
[muffled groan]

1:18:07.280 --> 1:18:09.200
You've got a problem!

1:18:09.280 --> 1:18:11.160
And Control's going to hear about it.

1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:13.040
[thunder rumbling]

1:18:13.160 --> 1:18:16.040
I've got eyes on the ridiculous unicorn.

1:18:16.120 --> 1:18:17.680
He's heading in.

1:18:22.120 --> 1:18:23.560
Why a unicorn?

1:19:01.320 --> 1:19:02.640
[Portia] Who are you?

1:19:03.880 --> 1:19:05.400
Why are you doing this?

1:19:06.080 --> 1:19:11.400
Okay, so it's not really
<i>who</i> we are that's important.

1:19:11.480 --> 1:19:12.640
It's <i>what </i>we are.

1:19:13.640 --> 1:19:14.840
You see…

1:19:17.640 --> 1:19:19.680
we're aliens.

1:19:20.920 --> 1:19:22.120
From outer space.

1:19:23.440 --> 1:19:25.120
Just like in your movies.

1:19:25.200 --> 1:19:27.400
You know? Movies?

1:19:28.240 --> 1:19:30.120
This is where we get our accents from.

1:19:30.880 --> 1:19:34.720
So I choose a Russian spy
with sexy protocol.

1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:37.760
[in Jamaican Patois] Yeah, man.
And I choose the best of all.

1:19:37.840 --> 1:19:40.960
A Rastafarian from Jamaica.

1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:44.520
[in English] And I'm a fusion of
the two greatest humans that ever lived,

1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:48.040
Mahatma Gandhi and Kylie Minogue.

1:19:48.120 --> 1:19:50.080
[canisters rattling]

1:19:50.160 --> 1:19:52.160
[tense music playing]

1:20:10.800 --> 1:20:13.560
[Gregory laughing]

1:20:15.480 --> 1:20:17.920
[indistinct chattering]

1:20:21.800 --> 1:20:22.880
[Gregory] You are?

1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:30.640
Hey. How's it going in there?

1:20:31.600 --> 1:20:34.760
He's covered by ten feet of concrete.
He can't hear you from here.

1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:37.600
Right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. My bad.

1:20:39.160 --> 1:20:40.320
Over and out.

1:20:44.200 --> 1:20:46.920
[Badrick] All right, baby.
I'll tell you a story.

1:20:48.240 --> 1:20:50.680
But I think for you,
it will be a nightmare.

1:20:50.760 --> 1:20:52.800
Because this here scary.

1:20:54.280 --> 1:20:58.800
What you call Zulcanoid
came here on a meteor

1:20:58.880 --> 1:21:00.560
when our moon exploded.

1:21:01.400 --> 1:21:03.080
Our job is to find it.

1:21:05.920 --> 1:21:07.440
[sizzling]

1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:11.520
[exhales]

1:21:13.680 --> 1:21:16.640
Not only does it regenerate the skin,

1:21:17.240 --> 1:21:18.840
it repairs our bodies,

1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:21.600
gives us energy.

1:21:22.520 --> 1:21:24.600
Basically, it keeps us alive.

1:21:25.400 --> 1:21:26.560
[Anya] You see?

1:21:27.240 --> 1:21:29.960
It make me like new woman.

1:21:31.520 --> 1:21:35.960
In a few days we are going
to take all the Zulcanoid.

1:21:36.920 --> 1:21:39.440
That is not good news
for you and your friends.

1:21:40.480 --> 1:21:42.760
Because it's fire upon Babylon!

1:21:43.440 --> 1:21:45.680
We're gon' burn up everything!

1:21:47.640 --> 1:21:51.440
Nothing personal, you understand?

1:21:53.480 --> 1:21:56.120
Just protocol.

1:22:00.680 --> 1:22:01.960
[Junior] <i>Sam! Start the car.</i>

1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:04.880
Our new bosses are in the vault
and they're not human!

1:22:04.960 --> 1:22:08.160
-Hey! Uh-huh. Horses aren't allowed here.
-No. Shh. I'm not a horse. It's a mask.

1:22:08.240 --> 1:22:10.160
-No! You need to go home.
-Get away!

1:22:10.240 --> 1:22:13.080
-[Junior groaning]
-[blowing whistle]

1:22:13.160 --> 1:22:14.560
Run! Run!

-Come on. Come on!

[Junior] Go, go, go, go, go!

1:22:23.920 --> 1:22:25.080
Come on! Go, go, go!

1:22:27.240 --> 1:22:29.480
-[Prince] Go, go, go, go, go!
-[engine sputtering]

1:22:29.560 --> 1:22:32.280
-All right!
-[Junior] Get us the fuck out of here!

1:22:32.360 --> 1:22:34.880
-I'm trying!
-Come on!

1:22:34.960 --> 1:22:36.720
[engine starts]

1:22:36.800 --> 1:22:38.160
[Junior whoops]

1:22:40.720 --> 1:22:43.200
[whistle continues blowing]

1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:45.080
Oh my God!

1:22:45.160 --> 1:22:46.520
What? What now?

1:22:46.600 --> 1:22:47.880
I think that was a limb!

1:22:47.960 --> 1:22:49.640
-[Sam] What?
-It flew across the window!

1:22:49.720 --> 1:22:51.720
[whistle blowing]

1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:54.840
[whistle stops]

1:22:57.000 --> 1:22:58.320
[bottle rattles]

1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:02.480
How about a snack?

1:23:05.280 --> 1:23:06.960
What the fuck is going on?

1:23:07.480 --> 1:23:10.680
Where'd they come from?
Why did their skin glow?

1:23:10.760 --> 1:23:14.080
No! No. This can't be happening! [laughs]

1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:16.680
-Junior! Hey! Junior!
-This is not happening.

1:23:16.760 --> 1:23:17.840
What? What? What?

1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:20.440
Junior, I need you to focus, okay?

1:23:20.520 --> 1:23:22.000
-I need you to focus.
-Okay. Focus.

1:23:22.080 --> 1:23:23.760
Tell me what happened. Okay?

1:23:23.840 --> 1:23:25.400
What happened in the vault?

1:23:25.480 --> 1:23:29.120
What happened in the vault?
They, uh… they had someone tied up.

1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:32.800
Um, they said that
they needed Zulcanoid for their bodies.

1:23:32.880 --> 1:23:35.120
It heals their skin or some shit. Um…

1:23:36.680 --> 1:23:38.240
Ah… Fuck!

1:23:38.320 --> 1:23:40.080
What? What's going on?

1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:42.240
They're going to…

1:23:42.320 --> 1:23:45.800
They're gonna steal the Zulcanoid,
and then they're gonna burn everyone.

1:23:46.320 --> 1:23:47.720
That's it. That's their plan.

1:23:47.800 --> 1:23:49.960
Burn… Who? Who's going to burn?

1:23:50.040 --> 1:23:51.400
-Who's burning?
-The aliens!

1:23:51.480 --> 1:23:54.040
That's who's gonna
burn everyone. The aliens!

1:23:54.720 --> 1:23:57.680
Oh, God. I need something to breathe in.

1:23:57.760 --> 1:23:59.800
Is there like a plastic bag or some shit?

1:23:59.880 --> 1:24:01.320
Oh God…

1:24:02.440 --> 1:24:05.800
[breathing heavily]

1:24:06.960 --> 1:24:09.160
Sam. Sam, what are we going to do?

1:24:09.840 --> 1:24:10.840
I don't know.

1:24:10.920 --> 1:24:13.120
I need a minute to think. Okay?

1:24:13.200 --> 1:24:15.080
People are getting dismembered
while you think!

1:24:15.160 --> 1:24:17.360
Oh my God! There is no need
to be so overdramatic!

1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:19.640
Overdramatic? It's fucking aliens, Sam!

1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:22.760
They're going to fucking
eat your intestines and do "whooo-ooh!"

1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:24.680
What the hell is "whoo-ooh!"?

1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:28.200
It's the alien sound!
That's the sound they play for aliens!

1:24:28.280 --> 1:24:29.320
Fuck!

1:24:33.880 --> 1:24:35.880
[panting]

1:24:36.480 --> 1:24:38.480
[Prince's father]
<i>You're weak. Just like your mother.</i>

1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:40.880
[Colleen] <i>He's always late.</i>
<i>He lies all the time.</i>

1:24:40.960 --> 1:24:42.720
[father] <i>You don't have the stomach…</i>

1:24:42.800 --> 1:24:45.240
[Colleen] <i>Basically, he's the worst</i>
<i>staff member we've ever had.</i>

1:24:45.320 --> 1:24:47.800
[father]<i> It was a joke to you.</i>
<i>What'd you think was gonna happen?</i>

1:24:47.880 --> 1:24:49.920
[Colleen] <i>Clean that</i>
<i>or I'll give you another warning.</i>

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:51.080
[father] <i>Coward.</i>

1:24:51.160 --> 1:24:53.400
[Colleen laughing]

1:24:53.480 --> 1:24:55.640
-[Prince] We need to stop.
-Say what now?

1:24:58.120 --> 1:24:59.480
We need to pull over.

1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:01.560
Oh, I am not pulling over right now.

1:25:01.640 --> 1:25:05.040
Now! Pull over now! I am being serious!

1:25:05.880 --> 1:25:06.800
[exhales sharply]

1:25:06.880 --> 1:25:07.880
Okay.

1:25:19.840 --> 1:25:21.000
My dad was right.

1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:23.680
I've been a coward my whole life.

1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:26.040
And I'm sick of it.

1:25:28.280 --> 1:25:32.280
If we keep going, I will never change.

1:25:33.200 --> 1:25:34.800
Yeah, I will never.

1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:37.280
[exhales]

1:25:37.760 --> 1:25:39.000
We need to go back.

1:25:39.920 --> 1:25:41.360
Oh, we need to go back!

1:25:42.600 --> 1:25:43.960
He's right.

1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:47.440
These are our people. We drugged them.

1:25:48.040 --> 1:25:49.080
We did that.

1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:51.680
We can't leave them behind.

1:25:56.080 --> 1:25:58.440
No. No.

1:25:59.800 --> 1:26:03.040
We can't. They're our people.

1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:05.840
We go back.

1:26:07.680 --> 1:26:09.040
We're going back.

1:26:09.120 --> 1:26:10.520
We go fucking back.

1:26:24.240 --> 1:26:26.480
[breathing shakily]

1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:39.600
How's everyone feeling?

1:27:04.040 --> 1:27:06.440
[thunder rumbling]

1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:08.240
We're going to need some weapons.

1:27:10.360 --> 1:27:11.520
You mean like this?

1:27:13.880 --> 1:27:16.360
Not so ridiculous now, is it?

1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:18.200
Oh my…

1:27:18.280 --> 1:27:19.280
[exhales]

1:27:35.320 --> 1:27:39.360
Oh, nunchucks. Nice.

1:27:39.440 --> 1:27:41.440
Did it come with a Bruce Lee poster?

1:27:41.520 --> 1:27:43.120
Yeah, it did, actually.

1:27:44.440 --> 1:27:45.640
Is that a problem?

1:27:45.720 --> 1:27:46.680
No, not at all.

1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:49.160
As long as they don't break
while fighting an alien,

1:27:49.240 --> 1:27:50.960
then everything's all good.

1:27:51.040 --> 1:27:53.840
If I were you, I'd be more worried
about my table ornament.

1:27:53.920 --> 1:27:55.080
Table ornament?

1:27:55.600 --> 1:27:58.920
Dude, I'll have you know that
this was crafted by a master swordsmith

1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:00.320
in Osaka.

1:28:00.960 --> 1:28:02.720
So it's basically unbreakable.

1:28:02.800 --> 1:28:03.680
Guys. Hey.

1:28:04.640 --> 1:28:05.640
Sorry. Sorry.

1:28:09.760 --> 1:28:10.680
Wait.

1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:14.200
-[spits]
-Oh…

1:28:14.880 --> 1:28:17.160
We don't let them get away.
We fight to the death.

1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:20.120
Why do you keep spitting on yourself?

1:28:21.080 --> 1:28:22.280
What is wrong with you?

1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:24.640
Come on, man! This is a real moment.

1:28:24.720 --> 1:28:26.320
We're probably gonna die here.

1:28:26.400 --> 1:28:29.160
We are not going to die. Okay?

1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:30.520
How do you know?

1:28:32.400 --> 1:28:33.560
I just know.

1:28:34.200 --> 1:28:37.440
Now come on. Let's go get these assholes.

1:28:38.200 --> 1:28:39.840
Last thing, that is disgusting.

1:28:39.920 --> 1:28:42.480
Also, a spit oath is not a real thing.

1:28:42.560 --> 1:28:45.080
-It is a real thing.
-Yeah. If you're, like, eight.

1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:52.240
[thunder rumbling]

1:28:57.120 --> 1:28:59.280
-Wait. Wait!
-What?

1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:00.360
The vault door.

1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:01.680
What about it?

1:29:02.360 --> 1:29:05.000
-Their lives depend on Zulcanoid, right?
-Right.

1:29:05.760 --> 1:29:07.880
So why would they leave
the vault door open?

1:29:08.480 --> 1:29:09.520
It's a trap.

1:29:09.600 --> 1:29:10.880
Oh, shit.

1:29:10.960 --> 1:29:12.960
[knocking]

1:29:17.480 --> 1:29:18.680
[Badrick] Wagwan!

1:29:22.400 --> 1:29:26.240
Oh, shit.
They look really happy to see us.

1:29:26.320 --> 1:29:27.960
That is a terrible sign.

1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:29.120
This is it.

1:29:29.800 --> 1:29:30.800
I'll take the office.

1:29:30.880 --> 1:29:31.800
I'll take the vault.

1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:33.040
-Good luck.
-You too.

1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:35.360
Whoa. Whoa!
You guys are leaving me with him?

1:29:35.440 --> 1:29:37.520
There's three of them,
there's three of us.

1:29:37.600 --> 1:29:39.080
You have a sword. He doesn't.

1:29:39.160 --> 1:29:40.320
You'll be fine.

1:29:41.600 --> 1:29:43.200
Dude, you can take him.

1:29:46.320 --> 1:29:47.640
Definitely.

1:29:48.880 --> 1:29:51.920
Okay. I can… I can take him.

1:29:52.000 --> 1:29:54.480
Looks like it's just you and me, Princey.

1:29:55.480 --> 1:29:57.640
This is going to be so much fun.

1:29:58.440 --> 1:30:02.960
Just the two of us
dancing through the night.

1:30:03.040 --> 1:30:06.080
Dancing and fighting.
The two things I can't do. Fuck!

1:30:07.360 --> 1:30:08.720
What you have there?

1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:11.000
It's a… It's a samurai sword.

1:30:11.640 --> 1:30:14.960
Yeah, it's from Osaka,
so it's really legit.

1:30:15.040 --> 1:30:16.760
Ho-ho!

1:30:17.400 --> 1:30:18.680
Princey have a sword.

1:30:19.600 --> 1:30:21.920
Princey have a sword!

1:30:22.560 --> 1:30:25.720
What you gon' do with it?
Chop off me head?

1:30:25.800 --> 1:30:28.760
Um. I was maybe thinking about it. But--

1:30:28.840 --> 1:30:30.560
There's only one problem, man.

1:30:31.640 --> 1:30:33.920
You brought a sword to a gunfight.

1:30:34.440 --> 1:30:36.200
Let me show you what I have.

1:30:36.280 --> 1:30:37.520

1:30:40.960 --> 1:30:42.240
Holy shit!

1:30:42.320 --> 1:30:43.680
Oh, Princey!

1:30:43.760 --> 1:30:45.600
Oh my fucking shit!

1:30:47.360 --> 1:30:50.360
[tense music playing]

1:31:11.280 --> 1:31:13.160
So what? We're hiding now?

1:31:14.360 --> 1:31:16.120
I could've sworn he was right here.

1:31:17.040 --> 1:31:18.560
Hello, mate.

1:31:18.640 --> 1:31:21.920
I believe you humans
call it teleportation.

1:31:23.400 --> 1:31:26.240
I knew you'd come back.
You're a feisty one.

1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:28.920
But it's a big mistake.

1:31:29.000 --> 1:31:31.320
Yeah, well, you know what?
The way I see it…

1:31:31.400 --> 1:31:35.200
it's only a big mistake…
if I don't kick your ass.

1:31:35.280 --> 1:31:37.640
Well, Sammy, that's your first problem.

1:31:38.480 --> 1:31:39.960
I don't have an ass.

1:31:40.040 --> 1:31:42.680
My name is not Sammy!

1:31:42.760 --> 1:31:44.280

-[mug shatters]

1:32:17.600 --> 1:32:19.880
[tense music playing]

1:32:25.200 --> 1:32:26.640
Portia! What're you doing here?

1:32:26.720 --> 1:32:28.040
I was looking for you.

1:32:28.120 --> 1:32:29.160
What?

1:32:30.160 --> 1:32:33.640
It doesn't matter!
Listen… we're under attack.

1:32:33.720 --> 1:32:36.560
I know how this is gonna sound,
our new owners are aliens.

1:32:36.640 --> 1:32:38.600
And they're trying to kill everyone!

1:32:38.680 --> 1:32:40.960
Calm down. It's okay.

1:32:42.040 --> 1:32:43.240
What do you mean?

1:32:43.320 --> 1:32:44.680
Death is just a part of change.

1:32:45.240 --> 1:32:47.080
[Russian accent]
Nothing to be worried about.

1:32:47.160 --> 1:32:48.280
Excuse me?

1:32:50.520 --> 1:32:51.560
Surprise!

1:32:53.400 --> 1:32:54.640
Oh God.

1:32:54.720 --> 1:32:56.480
[groans]

1:32:56.560 --> 1:32:58.120
[Badrick chuckling]

1:32:58.200 --> 1:32:59.360
I tell you what.

1:33:00.040 --> 1:33:01.880
I'll let you take a free swing.

1:33:02.440 --> 1:33:04.240
Give it all you've got.

1:33:05.240 --> 1:33:07.840
See if you can reach mi neck.

1:33:08.760 --> 1:33:10.120
God, you're hard to look at.

1:33:10.840 --> 1:33:13.360
Or we could just keep talking?

1:33:13.440 --> 1:33:16.160
I think there's a lot
we could learn from each other.

1:33:16.240 --> 1:33:18.680
So, what's your planet like?

1:33:19.480 --> 1:33:20.920
I'm sure it's so lovely.

1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:22.880
It's a free hit, man!

1:33:22.960 --> 1:33:24.520
Do it while you still can!

1:33:25.280 --> 1:33:27.040
Okay, Prince. You can do this.

1:33:27.120 --> 1:33:28.760
Come on, man! Don't be a pussy!

1:33:29.720 --> 1:33:30.680
[screams]

1:33:35.480 --> 1:33:36.760
[Gregory] Sammy!

1:33:37.680 --> 1:33:42.280
Sammy! Did you know
that humans can actually fly?

1:33:42.360 --> 1:33:43.600
[laughs] Oh yeah!

1:33:43.680 --> 1:33:44.640
If you wanted to,

1:33:44.720 --> 1:33:47.440
you could cut through the air
like a bloody gazelle.

1:33:47.520 --> 1:33:49.400
There's only one small hiccup.

1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:52.280
The landing.

1:33:53.560 --> 1:33:54.440
[Sam grunts]

1:33:54.520 --> 1:33:55.680
-[doll squeaks]
-Oh!

1:33:55.760 --> 1:33:56.920
[groans]

1:33:57.000 --> 1:33:58.640
[laughs]

1:33:58.720 --> 1:33:59.840
Ooh, crikey!

1:33:59.920 --> 1:34:02.240
-[coughs]
-[Gregory] That's got to hurt.

1:34:04.560 --> 1:34:05.640
[Sam grunts] Fuck!

1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:11.160
[Junior groans]

1:34:16.800 --> 1:34:17.920
Pathetic.

1:34:22.080 --> 1:34:25.120
How much body percent fat
are you anyway, huh?

1:34:28.520 --> 1:34:31.240
I really do hope
that you're not too hairy.

1:34:33.120 --> 1:34:34.360
[groans]

1:34:34.440 --> 1:34:37.640
You humans are so soft.

1:34:38.560 --> 1:34:39.880
Like little jellyfish.

1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:43.160
That's why you're so tasty.

1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:45.120
[screams]

1:34:47.080 --> 1:34:49.040
[exclaiming]

1:34:49.120 --> 1:34:50.400
Ha!

1:34:51.040 --> 1:34:53.040
I just make clowning with you!

1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:56.160
I don't have the pain receptors. So…

1:34:56.760 --> 1:34:57.840
You know?

1:34:57.920 --> 1:34:58.920
But you do.

1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:02.960
[groans, yells]

1:35:03.040 --> 1:35:04.080
[screaming]

1:35:05.800 --> 1:35:06.720
[Prince] Oh my God!

1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:08.360
[sword clatters]

1:35:08.440 --> 1:35:10.160
That was probably an ornament.

1:35:11.240 --> 1:35:12.960
[yells, grunts]

1:35:13.040 --> 1:35:15.360
[coughs] Ah!

1:35:15.440 --> 1:35:16.360
Fuck!

1:35:20.360 --> 1:35:23.280
-[Gregory] Come on, mate.
-Ah, shit.

1:35:23.360 --> 1:35:24.280
Wake up.

1:35:25.240 --> 1:35:26.720
Where you gonna go?

1:35:27.480 --> 1:35:30.720
In case you haven't noticed,
I can go anywhere I want!

1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:35.920
-[Gregory laughs]
-Fuck!

1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:38.560
Okay. Here's a clue.

1:35:39.720 --> 1:35:40.560
Shit.

1:35:40.640 --> 1:35:44.120
[Gregory] The more intelligent
the life-form, the less physical matter.

1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:46.520
I'm 92% gas, mate.

1:35:47.400 --> 1:35:50.520
Mainly hydrogen
and a lovely little bit of butane.

1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:53.320
So that's why throwing things at me…

1:35:53.400 --> 1:35:54.600
[clatters]

1:35:54.680 --> 1:35:56.240
…is not gonna help you.

1:35:57.400 --> 1:35:59.520
You know what? You're right.

1:36:00.120 --> 1:36:03.640
Well, halle-bloody-lujah!
He's finally getting it! [laughs]

1:36:03.720 --> 1:36:05.320
But there's something you should know.

1:36:05.400 --> 1:36:06.840
Oh, yeah? What's that, mate?

1:36:07.920 --> 1:36:10.280
[dramatic music playing]

1:36:11.480 --> 1:36:13.720
I'm a goddamn geologist.

1:36:17.120 --> 1:36:19.520
[groaning]

1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:32.400
Which makes me an expert in gas, asshole.

1:36:32.480 --> 1:36:33.760
[crackling]

1:36:35.880 --> 1:36:38.080
[grunting]

1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.080
Any last wishes, Princey?

1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:44.480
Yes, actually.

1:36:46.680 --> 1:36:48.160
If you're gonna kill me,

1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:50.040
I'm not dying on my knees.

1:36:50.120 --> 1:36:51.520
No problem, mon.

1:36:52.040 --> 1:36:53.960
But you close your eyes.

1:36:54.040 --> 1:36:55.640
This is going to hurt.

1:36:55.720 --> 1:36:57.280
I don't care.

1:36:57.360 --> 1:36:58.800
I'm not closing my eyes.

1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:01.120
Even though I really want to.

1:37:01.200 --> 1:37:02.720
Aren't you the brave one?

1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:04.640
Suit yourself.

1:37:09.040 --> 1:37:10.520
[gas whooshing]

1:37:19.720 --> 1:37:22.120
Oh my shit! Oh my shit!

1:37:23.200 --> 1:37:24.160
Hey, man!

1:37:25.280 --> 1:37:26.400
Good timing.

1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:28.120
Like, really good timing!

1:37:28.200 --> 1:37:30.240
Yeah, you okay?

1:37:30.320 --> 1:37:32.440
Yeah, I… [exhales]

1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:34.040
I think so.

1:37:34.120 --> 1:37:36.120
I did ruin my pants, though. But…

1:37:37.080 --> 1:37:39.440
Better my pants than my face, right?

1:37:39.520 --> 1:37:40.520
Good to know.

1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:42.880
-Let's go. We've got to find Junior.
-Um…

1:37:43.840 --> 1:37:45.800
Maybe he's already at the car.
You know what?

1:37:46.400 --> 1:37:48.960
-I'll go check.
-Prince. Let's go.

1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:53.760
Okay. Oh God.

1:37:53.840 --> 1:37:55.880
[Junior moaning in pain]

1:37:55.960 --> 1:37:58.480
You want to know what
they call me back on my planet?

1:38:00.120 --> 1:38:04.080
Something like… "The Devourer." Huh?

1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:07.440
Do you want to see why?

1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:09.160
Yes?

1:38:09.920 --> 1:38:11.360
[roars]

1:38:11.440 --> 1:38:13.000
Oh shit!

1:38:13.080 --> 1:38:14.720
Get away from him, you monster!

1:38:14.800 --> 1:38:15.920
No! Portia, no! Run!

1:38:16.000 --> 1:38:19.160
-[gas whooshing]
-[Anya screeching]

1:38:33.040 --> 1:38:34.000
Thank you.

1:38:34.080 --> 1:38:35.440
No problem.

1:38:41.800 --> 1:38:43.200
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

1:38:43.280 --> 1:38:44.480
-You sure?
-What about you?

1:38:44.560 --> 1:38:46.680
-Your leg?
-I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

1:38:46.760 --> 1:38:48.520
It's nothing. I can barely feel it.

1:38:51.360 --> 1:38:52.360
How'd you know?

1:38:54.240 --> 1:38:55.840
Found out they were made of gas.

1:38:55.920 --> 1:38:57.160
[gas whooshes]

1:38:58.320 --> 1:38:59.360
So I took a chance.

1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:01.240
Uh, good call.

1:39:03.440 --> 1:39:06.880
Hey. So you took him out? The big guy?

1:39:06.960 --> 1:39:09.480
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I slapped him around a bit,

1:39:09.560 --> 1:39:13.200
and then sliced his head off. Just like…

1:39:13.280 --> 1:39:14.840
So Sam saved you too?

1:39:14.920 --> 1:39:16.120
Yeah, 100 percent.

1:39:16.200 --> 1:39:17.160
Right.

1:39:17.840 --> 1:39:19.480
Is that a pen in your leg?

1:39:19.560 --> 1:39:20.920
Yeah.

1:39:21.000 --> 1:39:23.640
Oh my God, dude.
We need to take it out, like, right now.

1:39:23.720 --> 1:39:24.600
What? No?

1:39:24.680 --> 1:39:26.760
You could get ink poisoning. It's fatal.

1:39:26.840 --> 1:39:28.720
Ink poisoning isn't a thing.

1:39:28.800 --> 1:39:31.240
Oh, dude. It's really a thing.

1:39:31.320 --> 1:39:32.240
Sorry.

1:39:33.320 --> 1:39:34.680
-Just let me--
-Whoa! Wait!

1:39:34.760 --> 1:39:36.680
What if it's in an artery? Huh?

1:39:37.200 --> 1:39:38.840
I could bleed to death.

1:39:38.920 --> 1:39:40.360
There's a small chance of that.

1:39:40.440 --> 1:39:42.720
But there's hardly
any major arteries in your legs.

1:39:42.800 --> 1:39:43.760
That's not true.

1:39:43.840 --> 1:39:46.320
Okay, trust me! I have
a medical degree, okay?

1:39:46.400 --> 1:39:49.600
You studied for three months online,
Prince. You don't know shit!

1:39:49.680 --> 1:39:51.480
Okay, that's just semantics.

1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:53.440
-I think… Just let--
-[Junior] Can you stop?

1:39:53.520 --> 1:39:54.840
-Please. Just--
-Just be brave!

1:39:54.920 --> 1:39:57.720
-[squelching]
-[groans]

1:39:57.800 --> 1:39:58.880
Here you go.

1:39:59.680 --> 1:40:02.600
-Ah…
-Now, can we please get out of here?

1:40:03.160 --> 1:40:04.160
Okay?

1:40:04.240 --> 1:40:06.160
Yeah. Of course.

1:40:06.240 --> 1:40:08.120
You can put your-- Okay.

1:40:08.200 --> 1:40:10.280
[grunting]

1:40:10.360 --> 1:40:11.440
Okay.

1:40:12.800 --> 1:40:15.880
[Junior groaning]

1:40:18.080 --> 1:40:19.480
What did she do to you?

1:40:19.560 --> 1:40:21.720
I don't know. I mean, I just blacked out.

1:40:21.800 --> 1:40:24.440
All I remember is
I was cleaning outside of her office--

1:40:24.520 --> 1:40:26.520
Whoa! Okay, Portia! Guys, wait!

1:40:27.720 --> 1:40:28.600
Take it easy.

1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:30.560
Is she okay?

1:40:30.640 --> 1:40:32.520
I just need to catch my breath.

1:40:32.600 --> 1:40:35.360
Breathe in through your nose
and out through your mouth.

1:40:35.440 --> 1:40:39.280
Wow. All this time I thought
it was "breathe out, then in."

1:40:39.360 --> 1:40:40.880
-What?
-Oh, shit.

1:40:41.760 --> 1:40:42.640
What a night.

1:40:44.200 --> 1:40:46.400
I'm still trying to process everything.
You know?

1:40:46.480 --> 1:40:47.840
[Prince] Tell me about it.

1:40:48.440 --> 1:40:50.600
I'm gonna need
years of therapy after this.

1:40:50.680 --> 1:40:53.880
I mean, those were real aliens, you know?

1:40:53.960 --> 1:40:55.280
We didn't imagine that.

1:40:56.240 --> 1:40:57.200
Hey, man. Um…

1:40:58.200 --> 1:40:59.560
-Don't move.
-What?

1:40:59.640 --> 1:41:01.200
No! Don't move.

1:41:01.280 --> 1:41:02.160
What is it?

1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:03.080
Um…

1:41:03.960 --> 1:41:05.320
It's probably nothing.

1:41:05.400 --> 1:41:07.120
Prince! Dude, what is it?

1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:08.280
Oh, shit.

1:41:10.240 --> 1:41:12.120
[splattering]

1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:16.520
[screaming]

1:41:19.160 --> 1:41:20.880
Okay. I can fix this!

1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:23.200
Wait, I'm going to be a paramedic.

1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:24.160
I can fix this.

1:41:25.200 --> 1:41:26.080
I can do this.

1:41:26.160 --> 1:41:27.520
-Prince. Give me the leg.
-No.

1:41:27.600 --> 1:41:29.760
-Give me the leg. Let go!
-No! I can't let go!

1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:31.760
-No! He needs it.
-Let go!

1:41:31.840 --> 1:41:34.200
Legs are important! Okay?

1:41:34.280 --> 1:41:37.640
He doesn't need his legs
because he's dead!

1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:40.120
Gone! Okay?

1:41:40.200 --> 1:41:43.360
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing you can do for him now!

1:41:43.440 --> 1:41:44.680
No! [grunts]

1:41:44.760 --> 1:41:47.480
It doesn't matter, okay?
All I need is a first-aid kit,

1:41:47.560 --> 1:41:49.480
a shitload of bandages.

1:41:49.960 --> 1:41:51.920
I can do this. I can do this.

1:41:53.200 --> 1:41:54.800
[sobs]

1:41:54.880 --> 1:41:56.280
[sobs]

1:41:58.120 --> 1:41:59.680
Bandages?

1:41:59.760 --> 1:42:01.720
Dude, what're you talking about?

1:42:01.800 --> 1:42:02.840
Are you crying?

1:42:02.920 --> 1:42:05.600
No. No, not at all! I'm…

1:42:06.600 --> 1:42:10.200
Whoa! I…
I think I'm allergic to the aliens.

1:42:10.720 --> 1:42:12.640
You had another one
of those stupid visions?

1:42:12.720 --> 1:42:15.520
No, I didn't have one of those
stupid visions, okay? Shut up.

1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:20.280
-Can you walk?
-Yeah, I can walk.

1:42:20.360 --> 1:42:21.520
Yeah, I got you.

1:42:23.720 --> 1:42:24.680
Thanks.

1:42:25.640 --> 1:42:27.480
-You good?
-Yeah.

1:42:28.560 --> 1:42:30.040
You know what sucks?

1:42:30.120 --> 1:42:32.640
We just saved everyone,
and no one's gonna know.

1:42:32.720 --> 1:42:34.720
That's okay. We'll know.

1:42:34.800 --> 1:42:37.000
Oh, please. Don't act like you don't care.

1:42:37.080 --> 1:42:39.680
You're just trying
to impress your girlfriend.

1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:41.000
No, that's not it.

1:42:41.080 --> 1:42:43.080
I'm not-- And she's not my girlfriend.

1:42:44.960 --> 1:42:45.960
Are you?

1:42:46.720 --> 1:42:48.560
You can be such
an idiot sometimes, Junior.

1:42:58.200 --> 1:42:59.680
I love you too.

1:42:59.760 --> 1:43:01.960
Uh, I mean, I like you.

1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:04.040
You like me too, so…

1:43:04.640 --> 1:43:05.760
We like each other.

1:43:08.880 --> 1:43:09.800
[chuckles lightly]

1:43:11.440 --> 1:43:12.400
I love you.

1:43:15.480 --> 1:43:16.760
I think my luck's changing!

1:43:16.840 --> 1:43:18.400
[explosion]

1:43:18.480 --> 1:43:20.280
What the fuck just happened?

1:43:34.840 --> 1:43:35.880
Huh.

1:43:35.960 --> 1:43:36.920
Melusi.

1:43:38.080 --> 1:43:40.240
He must've put paint in the Zulcanoid.

1:43:41.560 --> 1:43:42.840
Overheated in the car.

1:43:42.920 --> 1:43:44.840
What were you saying about luck changing?

1:43:54.800 --> 1:43:56.560
Sam? What're you doing?

1:44:05.720 --> 1:44:06.600
Sam?

1:44:14.640 --> 1:44:18.240
[Sam] <i>Often the solutions to our problems</i>
<i>are a lot closer than we think.</i>

1:44:23.320 --> 1:44:25.760
<i>Sometimes they're right in front of us.</i>

1:44:30.680 --> 1:44:32.240
[laughing]

1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:34.000
Oh my goodness! It works.

1:44:41.800 --> 1:44:43.680
[Sam] <i>Turns out</i>
<i>the real value of Zulcanoid</i>

1:44:44.400 --> 1:44:46.480
<i>is what it can do for damaged skin.</i>

1:44:47.120 --> 1:44:49.960
<i>And that changed everything.</i>

1:44:52.040 --> 1:44:54.040
[laughing]

1:44:59.960 --> 1:45:02.920
Dude, I still can't believe
that this is our place.

1:45:03.000 --> 1:45:04.760
[laughs] I mean, look at this view!

1:45:05.560 --> 1:45:06.560
It's ridiculous.

1:45:07.840 --> 1:45:10.480
It beats the shit out of my car,
that's for sure.

1:45:13.160 --> 1:45:15.120
You know I've never had a roommate before?

1:45:16.280 --> 1:45:18.240
It's gonna be a new journey for us, man.

1:45:19.800 --> 1:45:21.880
You don't meditate

1:45:21.960 --> 1:45:24.520
in the mornings, like… naked?

1:45:25.040 --> 1:45:26.440
Anything like that, right?

1:45:26.520 --> 1:45:29.360
I mean, I don't,
but if that's something you want to try?

1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:30.560
No!

1:45:30.640 --> 1:45:31.880
That's not what I meant.

1:45:31.960 --> 1:45:33.440
Sorry. I just misread.

1:45:33.520 --> 1:45:35.080
Never mind. Let's just pretend…

1:45:35.160 --> 1:45:36.400
What did you even say?

1:45:36.480 --> 1:45:37.440
-What?
-[Portia] Um…

1:45:38.040 --> 1:45:39.920
So I do most of my things naked.

1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:41.680
Are you boys okay with that?

1:45:41.760 --> 1:45:43.280
100% fine with that. Yeah.

1:45:43.360 --> 1:45:44.840
Beers in the fridge.

1:45:44.920 --> 1:45:45.840
Thank you.

1:45:45.920 --> 1:45:48.040
-Don't do that.
-Oh my God. She winked at me.

1:45:48.120 --> 1:45:49.200
-No, she didn't.
-Dude.

1:45:49.280 --> 1:45:52.480
I am a medical professional.

1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:54.360
The human body means nothing to me.

1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:55.400
That's not true.

1:45:55.480 --> 1:45:56.560
I took an oath.

1:45:56.640 --> 1:45:57.600
I don't believe you.

1:45:57.680 --> 1:45:59.320
-I did. Yeah.
-Prince!

1:45:59.400 --> 1:46:02.440
That's… That's not funny.
Wait. Don't do that.

1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:07.040
[Junior] <i>AMI didn't just</i>
<i>get a new lease on life,</i>

1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:10.000
<i>they got a new leader.</i>

1:46:11.560 --> 1:46:13.720
<i>Someone who we could all get behind.</i>

1:46:15.560 --> 1:46:19.200
<i>And he made sure</i>
<i>that everyone got what they deserved.</i>

1:46:37.760 --> 1:46:39.760
[yells]

1:46:43.280 --> 1:46:44.120
Huh?

1:46:50.880 --> 1:46:51.880
[gasps]

1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:54.800
[laughs]

1:47:18.840 --> 1:47:21.440
They say you stole over 50 million.

1:47:21.960 --> 1:47:23.040
Is it true?

1:47:23.960 --> 1:47:26.240
That's a lie. I didn't steal anything.

1:47:26.320 --> 1:47:28.680
[guard] Ha! Whatever you say, Chief.

1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:31.680
Welcome to your new home.

1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:50.440
Hey. You want to pat my dog?

1:47:50.520 --> 1:47:51.560
[guard] You're lucky.

1:47:51.640 --> 1:47:54.440
Fingers here makes a very special pudding.

1:47:54.520 --> 1:47:58.800
It's a secret recipe.
I'm busy making some right now.

1:47:58.880 --> 1:47:59.880
[grunts]

1:47:59.960 --> 1:48:00.800
[farts]

1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:02.640
Oh my God.

1:48:04.960 --> 1:48:08.280
[Prince] Does anyone want to tell me
what this creepy place is?

1:48:08.360 --> 1:48:11.720
[Sam] It's our old refinery.
We used to process Zulcanoid here.

1:48:11.800 --> 1:48:13.880
[Prince] Oh, how fascinating.

1:48:13.960 --> 1:48:16.080
I was hoping to go
on a work tour on a Saturday.

1:48:16.160 --> 1:48:17.640
[Junior] This isn't a work tour, okay?

1:48:17.720 --> 1:48:20.680
As the new head of security,
I've been checking out all our sites.

1:48:20.760 --> 1:48:23.560
And last night,
I found something unbelievable.

1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:25.440
And I mean unbelievable!

1:48:25.520 --> 1:48:28.480
Why didn't you just take a video
of this unbelievable thing

1:48:28.560 --> 1:48:29.480
and send it to me?

1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:32.320
No. This is something
that you need to see for yourselves.

1:48:32.400 --> 1:48:33.520
Okay?

1:48:34.480 --> 1:48:36.720
-You guys ready?
-[Prince] For what?

1:48:36.800 --> 1:48:38.280
To be disappointed?

1:48:38.360 --> 1:48:40.520
Ah! Probably how Portia feels.

1:48:40.600 --> 1:48:42.240
Just shut up! Come on.

1:48:45.400 --> 1:48:48.440
[dramatic music playing]

1:48:59.720 --> 1:49:03.640
Tell me that isn't the dopest shit
you've ever seen!

1:49:10.840 --> 1:49:11.840
Oh my God.

1:49:12.680 --> 1:49:14.360
Now we know how they got here.

1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:16.160
And this isn't even the best part.

1:49:17.680 --> 1:49:18.840
What do you mean?

1:49:19.680 --> 1:49:21.440
Wait till you see what's inside.

1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:24.640
What's inside?

1:49:26.440 --> 1:49:28.280
What's inside? What's inside?

1:49:29.080 --> 1:49:30.240
[sighs deeply]

1:49:30.320 --> 1:49:31.640
Oh, shit.

1:49:33.920 --> 1:49:38.640
