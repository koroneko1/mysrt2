1
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,272
Come on!

2
00:01:53,517 --> 00:01:58,566
FREE FALL

3
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,607
The early bird catches the worm.

4
00:02:40,017 --> 00:02:42,020
Get in closer! Closer!

5
00:02:44,142 --> 00:02:45,102
Get him!

6
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,893
Go!

7
00:02:57,433 --> 00:02:59,234
- What the hell? - That's it for today!

8
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:02,226
- Wanker! - What did you say?

9
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,481
You got shit for brains? It's an exercise!

10
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:06,726
Problem?

11
00:03:13,558 --> 00:03:16,818
- No. No problem. - In my office. Both of you.

12
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:25,185
Shit.

13
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,403
And?

14
00:03:52,392 --> 00:03:53,897
And what?

15
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:58,653
- What did he say to you? - What do you think he said?

16
00:03:59,392 --> 00:04:03,480
If I screw up again, I can stick my exam where the sun don't shine.

17
00:04:03,683 --> 00:04:05,153
Exactly

18
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,650
Quite a poet, that Brandt.

19
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:20,976
Got a light?

20
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,104
Sorry about earlier.

21
00:04:39,225 --> 00:04:40,185
Are you nuts?

22
00:04:48,558 --> 00:04:50,064
No way.

23
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,147
What?

24
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:02,519
It's dead.

25
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,234
Dead as a doornail.

26
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:16,981
Are you crazy? What if they catch us?

27
00:05:18,308 --> 00:05:20,643
- Pussy. - You calling me a pussy?

28
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,688
I'll give you pussy.

29
00:05:45,517 --> 00:05:47,022
Shit!

30
00:05:49,808 --> 00:05:51,646
Let's get out of here.

31
00:05:56,642 --> 00:05:58,028
Shit.

32
00:06:12,767 --> 00:06:14,355
Come on.

33
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:25,109
It was our job to escort the visiting fans.

34
00:06:25,975 --> 00:06:31,143
Our goal was to keep rival visiting fans and groups of fans

35
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:33,602
away from each other.

36
00:06:33,808 --> 00:06:36,274
There was an aggressive attitude

37
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:40,647
not just towards the visiting fans but also the police officers.

38
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,690
And various errors were made on the way to the station.

39
00:06:45,225 --> 00:06:49,065
Firstly, there were communication breakdowns.

40
00:06:53,433 --> 00:06:55,234
Breathe evenly.

41
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:58,479
- I'm gonna puke. - Well, not bad for a start.

42
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:05,188
Come on! Keep it up!

43
00:07:05,933 --> 00:07:07,439
Pussy.

44
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,604
How did you end up a cop?

45
00:07:40,517 --> 00:07:43,728
Ever heard of infiltrating the system?

46
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:47,520
What? You're an anarchist?

47
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:06,985
Keep it in.

48
00:08:15,558 --> 00:08:16,768
Are you nuts?

49
00:08:19,017 --> 00:08:20,936
It was just a joke.

50
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:28,188
Chill out.

51
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,528
Let's go.

52
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:49,685
Come on.

53
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,435
We missed you.

54
00:09:23,725 --> 00:09:25,562
I missed you, too.

55
00:09:45,725 --> 00:09:47,314
Now?

56
00:09:47,808 --> 00:09:49,444
Okay...

57
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:52,602
Hello, baby...

58
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,978
I'm Auntie Claudia and...

59
00:09:57,183 --> 00:10:00,312
And when you watch this on your 18th birthday,

60
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:04,144
- I hope this top still fits me. - So do I.

61
00:10:05,642 --> 00:10:08,356
That was your witty Uncle Frank and...

62
00:10:09,058 --> 00:10:11,939
look, here's your granddad.

63
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:15,604
- And there's your grandma. - Hello.

64
00:10:18,267 --> 00:10:19,938
And this lovely lady...

65
00:10:20,142 --> 00:10:21,896
is your mum.

66
00:10:23,975 --> 00:10:26,736
I can't wait to finally meet you.

67
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:29,691
And this bump... that's you.

68
00:10:31,642 --> 00:10:34,024
There's Daddy. This way.

69
00:10:36,017 --> 00:10:38,020
Say something to your son, Daddy.

70
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:40,650
I'm really proud of you.

71
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,775
And I think about you all the time.

72
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,393
And your family and your dad will always be there for you.

73
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:53,231
Am en! So, back to work.

74
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:55,899
Come on, I'll show you the garden.

75
00:11:08,892 --> 00:11:10,562
How was training?

76
00:11:12,558 --> 00:11:14,443
How do you think it was?

77
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,901
I mean how were the chicks?

78
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:21,060
Or have the paternal hormones damaged your eyesight?

79
00:11:21,267 --> 00:11:23,732
Not everyone's a randy bastard.

80
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,189
Look who's talking.

81
00:11:30,683 --> 00:11:32,769
We can't get through. Prepare to go in!

82
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,768
I repeat: prepare to go in!

83
00:11:36,725 --> 00:11:38,147
Got it.

84
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,650
Okay, let's go get hailed on!

85
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:55,062
Yes, yes, yes...!

86
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:59,277
- Oh, that was so close! - We're hot on your heels, guys!

87
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:04,392
So what's it like living next to your future in-laws?

88
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:07,735
I can almost watch his dad taking a leak.

89
00:12:08,475 --> 00:12:12,896
- Well, don't look a gift horse... - it's no gift. We'll pay them back.

90
00:12:15,933 --> 00:12:18,611
- Show us what you got! - It's not looking good.

91
00:12:18,808 --> 00:12:20,776
Quiet, please. The master needs to focus.

92
00:12:20,975 --> 00:12:23,060
- The master's over here! - Exactly.

93
00:13:02,433 --> 00:13:03,985
Are you okay?

94
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:17,109
As long as my parents don't burst into our bedroom...

95
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,651
When you go back to work, you'll be able to drop the baby off next door.

96
00:13:27,183 --> 00:13:30,028
You're starting to sound like your mother.

97
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:32,143
Bettina!

98
00:13:34,392 --> 00:13:35,731
You cow!

99
00:13:48,642 --> 00:13:50,111
Come here!

100
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,319
Benk? Here.

101
00:14:02,933 --> 00:14:04,522
Borgmann?

102
00:14:04,808 --> 00:14:06,858
Eitenbichler?

103
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,355
Engel?

104
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:13,518
Lieflander?

105
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,985
- Passanen? - Yes.

106
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,736
- What about Engel? Isn't he coming back? - Well, he's still enrolled.

107
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:25,193
- Possner? - Here.

108
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:28,728
- Schneider? - Here.

109
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:42,985
Makes you impotent.

110
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:46,392
Don't you ever read the package inserts?

111
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:00,855
Thank you.

112
00:15:11,808 --> 00:15:14,226
Brandt made a huge fuss again.

113
00:15:16,017 --> 00:15:17,901
I think he really missed me.

114
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,069
See you around.

115
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:11,436
Another jog in the forest?

116
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,233
I've had enough for today.

117
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:19,772
I nearly forgot what a great runner you are.

118
00:16:45,392 --> 00:16:47,442
I just wanted to say hi.

119
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,605
I love you, too.

120
00:16:52,725 --> 00:16:53,981
Okay...

121
00:16:54,517 --> 00:16:55,903
Ciao.

122
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:58,647
Bettina...

123
00:17:28,558 --> 00:17:30,396
Breathe evenly.

124
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:38,568
- Evenly! - Stop it!

125
00:17:44,725 --> 00:17:46,147
Stop it!

126
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:54,983
Why are you back so early?

127
00:20:55,183 --> 00:20:57,068
I wanted to see you.

128
00:20:58,850 --> 00:21:00,236
Are you okay?

129
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:04,977
We finished up early. Aren't you happy to see me?

130
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,480
Sure! Of course I'm happy!

131
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:29,774
How's training going?

132
00:21:32,017 --> 00:21:33,522
Okay.

133
00:21:35,058 --> 00:21:39,147
"Okay?" Do I have to drag every word out of you?

134
00:21:39,725 --> 00:21:42,273
How do you think it's going, Dad?

135
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:44,855
It's going well.

136
00:21:45,558 --> 00:21:47,857
He doesn't tell me much either.

137
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:51,188
I shared a room with a nutcase when I did my training.

138
00:21:51,392 --> 00:21:53,691
We had eight to a room in our day.

139
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:56,475
Never a boring moment, I can tell you.

140
00:21:57,933 --> 00:22:01,193
And how's your new "bedfellow"?

141
00:22:10,975 --> 00:22:13,736
- We haven't thanked you properly yet. - Marc.

142
00:22:14,225 --> 00:22:15,896
No, seriously.

143
00:22:16,808 --> 00:22:18,646
Thanks for making it possible.

144
00:22:20,308 --> 00:22:23,686
So, here's to the house and to good neighbors, of course.

145
00:22:23,892 --> 00:22:27,317
And to everything that's yet to come.

146
00:22:29,183 --> 00:22:31,151
- Bettina. - Cheers.

147
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,519
To you two... you three.

148
00:22:34,267 --> 00:22:36,684
- Morning all. - Morning.

149
00:22:36,892 --> 00:22:39,902
I'd like you to meet your new colleague, Kay Engel.

150
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,434
He'll fill the vacancy in our unit.

151
00:22:43,392 --> 00:22:46,319
But Eiden, you promised Limpinski a woman!

152
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:50,604
Borgmann, take him under your wing, will you?

153
00:22:50,808 --> 00:22:53,523
You already know him from the academy.

154
00:22:54,017 --> 00:22:57,442
Welcome to the unit. Here's to good teamwork.

155
00:22:57,808 --> 00:22:59,278
Welcome.

156
00:23:04,058 --> 00:23:05,564
So, is he any good?

157
00:23:07,058 --> 00:23:09,690
- Dunno. - I thought you knew him from training?

158
00:23:10,267 --> 00:23:11,653
So?

159
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:30,068
Get a move on.

160
00:23:42,475 --> 00:23:44,194
What are you doing here?

161
00:23:44,725 --> 00:23:46,526
Nice to see you, too.

162
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,937
Did you guys see Britt in action just now?

163
00:24:24,142 --> 00:24:28,858
- Wouldn't mind being locked up by her. - Can't you talk about anything else?

164
00:24:29,058 --> 00:24:31,275
- Or do you get off on it? - You don't?

165
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:37,399
So what do you think of her? Pretty hot for a bird in blue, huh?

166
00:24:38,892 --> 00:24:42,068
- Amazing tits. - Amazing tits!

167
00:24:43,267 --> 00:24:46,194
Hilarious. What is this? Kindergarten?

168
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,896
- No! - It's not looking good for you guys.

169
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,068
No! Let's play another game.

170
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,610
- Beginner's luck! - That's it.

171
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,934
The next round's on you.

172
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:13,399
There's Britt! Hello!

173
00:25:22,725 --> 00:25:24,977
This is a surprise. Hi, everyone.

174
00:25:25,558 --> 00:25:27,810
- Hi. - This is our new guy, Kay Engel.

175
00:25:28,017 --> 00:25:30,565
- Frank's wife, Claudia. - Hello.

176
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:31,893
Hey.

177
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,269
And Marc's girlfriend, Bettina.

178
00:25:36,308 --> 00:25:38,560
- Nice to meet you. - Hi.

179
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:45,435
Pretty scary, huh?

180
00:25:47,142 --> 00:25:50,318
- So... wanna join us? - We don't want to intrude.

181
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:53,606
- We're starting a new game, anyway. - Exactly.

182
00:25:55,683 --> 00:25:57,769
- Okay, then. Why not? - Great.

183
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:29,070
So...

184
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:31,651
now you know.

185
00:27:00,683 --> 00:27:02,568
Weird evening.

186
00:27:11,267 --> 00:27:15,771
Why didn't you tell me someone from the academy had joined the unit?

187
00:27:19,183 --> 00:27:20,819
Don't know.

188
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,272
He already bugged me during training.

189
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:27,610
How's that?

190
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:32,189
He seems really nice to me.

191
00:27:46,017 --> 00:27:47,605
Change partners.

192
00:27:53,517 --> 00:27:54,643
Attack!

193
00:28:02,225 --> 00:28:03,814
Attack!

194
00:28:10,142 --> 00:28:11,812
What the hell?

195
00:28:15,892 --> 00:28:16,982
Next.

196
00:28:30,892 --> 00:28:32,859
- See you in the canteen? - Sure.

197
00:28:39,683 --> 00:28:41,733
- Okay, see you in a bit. - Okay.

198
00:28:55,308 --> 00:28:58,686
- It was a dumb idea to come here. - No shit.

199
00:29:01,475 --> 00:29:04,734
Anyway, if you do want to go jogging sometime...

200
00:30:05,183 --> 00:30:06,475
Bettina.

201
00:32:34,433 --> 00:32:35,985
Everything okay?

202
00:33:08,142 --> 00:33:09,896
It was really nice.

203
00:33:41,017 --> 00:33:43,020
And breathe in again.

204
00:33:51,892 --> 00:33:54,985
Hello. Just join in. And breathe in again.

205
00:33:55,183 --> 00:33:56,191
Sorry.

206
00:34:05,017 --> 00:34:09,402
Good. And then carry on breathing normally.

207
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,277
Bettina... Don't make such a big deal out of it.

208
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:21,645
Don't make a big deal out of it? You've gotta be kidding!

209
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:24,611
- Don't shout. - I'll shout when I like.

210
00:34:26,683 --> 00:34:31,187
Do you know how awful it feels to sit there alone, like a single mum?

211
00:34:31,392 --> 00:34:35,101
- I just lost track of time. - What's up with your cell?

212
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,896
- I phoned you over and over again. - I left it in my car.

213
00:34:40,725 --> 00:34:43,605
Your mum had to take me in the end. Thanks a lot!

214
00:34:43,808 --> 00:34:48,893
But I couldn't explain why her son had to go jogging in this shitty weather.

215
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:59,066
I have to pull my finger out or I'll fail my exam.

216
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,984
I messed up in running.

217
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,104
Why didn't you tell me?

218
00:35:15,642 --> 00:35:17,858
Hardly surprising, the way you smoke.

219
00:35:29,683 --> 00:35:31,023
Morning.

220
00:35:37,475 --> 00:35:39,276
Did you sleep well?

221
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:51,479
- Don't you want to answer it? - No, let's eat.

222
00:35:55,142 --> 00:35:56,315
Come on.

223
00:36:06,808 --> 00:36:08,397
Just answer it.

224
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:16,101
Hello?

225
00:36:23,933 --> 00:36:27,442
Hey, I can't talk now. I'll call you later.

226
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:42,316
- Who was that? - Frank.

227
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,938
Aren't you going to eat?

228
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:49,022
Want some tea?

229
00:37:09,725 --> 00:37:11,396
Breathe evenly.

230
00:37:12,725 --> 00:37:14,017
Pussy.

231
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,227
Ever thought of just leaving it all behind?

232
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:01,434
Taking off and starting over.

233
00:39:02,142 --> 00:39:03,860
No, not really.

234
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:18,935
In case you ever need some space.

235
00:40:08,642 --> 00:40:09,981
I'm sorry.

236
00:40:13,433 --> 00:40:16,065
It just feels weird with the baby.

237
00:40:16,642 --> 00:40:18,443
Don't be stupid.

238
00:40:32,892 --> 00:40:34,278
Okay.

239
00:42:55,892 --> 00:42:57,278
Shit.

240
00:43:05,308 --> 00:43:07,394
Why didn't you wake me up?

241
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:12,480
I tried.

242
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,480
Loads of times.

243
00:43:19,475 --> 00:43:21,146
I'm sorry.

244
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,603
Is everything okay between us?

245
00:43:32,267 --> 00:43:33,902
What could be wrong?

246
00:43:57,225 --> 00:43:58,481
What?

247
00:44:11,392 --> 00:44:12,861
Marc!

248
00:44:16,975 --> 00:44:18,267
Bettina.

249
00:44:19,058 --> 00:44:19,982
Stop it!

250
00:44:20,808 --> 00:44:22,646
Stop it - Why?

251
00:44:26,808 --> 00:44:28,646
Stop it, Marc!

252
00:44:35,975 --> 00:44:37,646
I told you to stop it!

253
00:45:14,392 --> 00:45:16,193
I'm sorry.

254
00:45:18,017 --> 00:45:19,486
I...

255
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:28,235
- I haven't been myself lately. - Tell me something I don't know.

256
00:45:34,058 --> 00:45:36,441
Is that why you stink of alcohol?

257
00:45:42,558 --> 00:45:46,268
- I thought you were on duty. - We had a few beers in the canteen.

258
00:45:54,267 --> 00:45:57,692
- You think I'm seeing another woman? - Well?

259
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:00,903
Are you?

260
00:46:10,433 --> 00:46:12,567
What? Do you want me to swear?

261
00:46:13,142 --> 00:46:14,611
Okay.

262
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:17,977
You're not seeing another woman.

263
00:46:21,558 --> 00:46:23,727
That makes everything okay?

264
00:46:32,517 --> 00:46:34,899
Hey... I'm sorry.

265
00:47:37,892 --> 00:47:40,309
Everything looks just fine.

266
00:47:43,142 --> 00:47:45,394
There's enough amniotic ﬂuid.

267
00:47:46,392 --> 00:47:48,477
The blood ﬂow looks good, too.

268
00:47:51,642 --> 00:47:54,818
So, you can get dressed again now.

269
00:47:57,017 --> 00:47:58,486
There you go.

270
00:47:59,392 --> 00:48:00,683
Thanks.

271
00:48:04,142 --> 00:48:06,643
I'll just check the blood sugar levels.

272
00:48:07,225 --> 00:48:08,611
Thank you.

273
00:48:25,642 --> 00:48:29,067
Do you have any contact with Kay Engel outside of work?

274
00:48:30,350 --> 00:48:33,894
- What makes you say that? - Just answer me.

275
00:48:42,308 --> 00:48:46,610
- We go jogging together sometimes. - You don't go on your own?

276
00:48:50,475 --> 00:48:53,153
I thought you couldn't stand him.

277
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:57,270
I've got no one else to jog with.

278
00:48:58,975 --> 00:49:00,445
Let's go.

279
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:29,066
Aren't you going to tell her sometime?

280
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:50,610
I've got to go.

281
00:51:53,142 --> 00:51:57,314
For he's a jolly good fellow For he's a jolly good fellow

282
00:51:57,683 --> 00:52:00,646
For he's a jolly good fellow And so say all of us!

283
00:52:01,308 --> 00:52:04,189
- This is for the little rug rat. - Wow!

284
00:52:04,392 --> 00:52:05,601
Thanks, Frank.

285
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:09,606
Thanks, guys.

286
00:52:09,808 --> 00:52:11,693
Congratulations, Marc.

287
00:52:11,892 --> 00:52:13,729
Congratulations!

288
00:52:14,267 --> 00:52:16,270
Got a photo? I want to see him.

289
00:52:19,683 --> 00:52:21,438
There he is. Look.

290
00:52:22,433 --> 00:52:24,436
You can see he's not yours!

291
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:29,062
All newborn babies look like that. Here, look at that chin on him.

292
00:52:29,267 --> 00:52:31,850
- I'm jealous! - Do I hear wedding bells?

293
00:52:32,308 --> 00:52:34,394
Whose wedding bells?

294
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,433
You and him, of course. Jealous?

295
00:52:37,642 --> 00:52:39,194
What? No!

296
00:52:39,725 --> 00:52:42,308
- Congratulations. - Thanks. Look.

297
00:52:42,683 --> 00:52:45,943
- So, Marc. Cheers! - Thanks, guys.

298
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,393
- Thanks. - Cheers! To you!

299
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:54,153
More anyone?

300
00:53:01,183 --> 00:53:03,601
We're just giving you a little wash.

301
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:12,028
Shall I hold your hand? You can hold tight.

302
00:53:13,433 --> 00:53:16,017
Is that nice? Is that nice?

303
00:53:16,892 --> 00:53:18,610
Do you like that?

304
00:53:19,683 --> 00:53:21,153
I've got him.

305
00:53:22,392 --> 00:53:24,477
I've got you. I've got you.

306
00:53:25,142 --> 00:53:29,230
- I've got you. There we go. - You're all wet now.

307
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:32,230
I've got him.

308
00:53:43,308 --> 00:53:44,600
Shit.

309
00:54:07,100 --> 00:54:10,359
Are you nuts? Kay! I nearly crashed into you.

310
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,689
What the fuck are you doing?

311
00:54:20,350 --> 00:54:22,933
Nothing for days! Not even a fucking text.

312
00:54:23,308 --> 00:54:25,477
I'm a father now. Don't you get it?

313
00:54:26,225 --> 00:54:28,109
Shall I just abandon them?

314
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:31,900
- I didn't mean it like that. - what then? Huh?

315
00:54:35,433 --> 00:54:39,191
Stop kidding yourself. Just admit that you're gay.

316
00:54:41,683 --> 00:54:42,893
It isn't easy for me...

317
00:54:45,933 --> 00:54:48,565
I'm not gay, Kay. Got it?

318
00:54:50,392 --> 00:54:52,442
It was just a one-off with you.

319
00:54:52,933 --> 00:54:54,734
So stay away from me.

320
00:54:56,683 --> 00:54:58,686
Stay away from me, Kay.

321
00:56:05,558 --> 00:56:07,229
He's asleep.

322
00:56:25,517 --> 00:56:27,899
What's up? Everything okay?

323
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:31,522
I don't know.

324
00:56:50,933 --> 00:56:52,320
Was Was.

325
00:56:59,683 --> 00:57:01,651
Lately I've just had...

326
00:57:03,058 --> 00:57:06,353
the feeling that I'm suffocating.

327
00:57:06,933 --> 00:57:08,771
It's like...

328
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:13,651
I don't know.

329
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:18,234
It's just so stiﬂing.

330
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:21,484
Do you know what I mean?

331
00:57:22,433 --> 00:57:24,851
You wanted us to move in here.

332
00:57:27,475 --> 00:57:29,359
What did you expect?

333
00:57:31,642 --> 00:57:34,059
Hey, honey...

334
00:57:37,850 --> 00:57:39,900
We'll get through this.

335
00:57:41,850 --> 00:57:43,900
We have each other.

336
00:58:01,725 --> 00:58:04,735
So that's the schedule. There is one other thing.

337
00:58:06,517 --> 00:58:11,601
I hope I don't need to remind you: we will not tolerate discrimination.

338
00:58:13,142 --> 00:58:17,977
This applies when you're on duty and with your colleagues, of course.

339
00:58:20,308 --> 00:58:22,607
And I hope you won't forget this.

340
00:58:23,350 --> 00:58:25,353
Have I made myself clear?

341
00:58:27,975 --> 00:58:30,025
I want this unit to set an example.

342
00:58:33,933 --> 00:58:38,189
If you have any questions, feel free to come and talk to me.

343
00:58:44,392 --> 00:58:45,683
Hey.

344
00:58:45,892 --> 00:58:49,068
- What's up? - I have one word for you: cocksucker.

345
00:58:49,267 --> 00:58:52,478
That was my reaction, too. Imagine Britt's face!

346
00:58:52,975 --> 00:58:55,820
They picked Engel up in some gay bar last night.

347
00:58:56,017 --> 00:59:00,484
Completely wasted. He's been screwing us over all along.

348
00:59:00,683 --> 00:59:03,694
- Quite literally. - We get it, Limpinski.

349
00:59:03,892 --> 00:59:05,480
Well, it's true, isn't it?

350
00:59:51,475 --> 00:59:53,893
What's a gay bar with no bar stools?

351
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:00,604
A fruit stand.

352
01:00:01,058 --> 01:00:02,812
Isn't that right, Gregor?

353
01:00:27,517 --> 01:00:29,401
This is a surprise.

354
01:00:39,433 --> 01:00:41,483
That raid had been planned for weeks.

355
01:00:43,308 --> 01:00:45,525
Is that all you have to say?

356
01:00:46,475 --> 01:00:48,312
Are you losing it?

357
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:51,982
You want to blackmail me with that shit?

358
01:00:53,475 --> 01:00:54,980
Blackmail?

359
01:00:58,058 --> 01:00:59,398
You fucking asshole.

360
01:00:59,850 --> 01:01:02,528
Did I ask you to come here and fuck up my life?

361
01:01:06,225 --> 01:01:08,026
Did I make you suck my cock, huh?

362
01:01:10,225 --> 01:01:12,275
- Go on, hit me! - Yeah? -Yeah!

363
01:01:12,475 --> 01:01:13,648
Yeah?

364
01:01:19,683 --> 01:01:21,852
What were you doing there anyway?

365
01:01:22,058 --> 01:01:23,647
Fucking other guys?

366
01:01:24,892 --> 01:01:26,811
I'll fuck whoever like!

367
01:01:29,683 --> 01:01:31,402
What's your problem?

368
01:01:31,725 --> 01:01:33,479
Nothing but "Me! Me! Me"!

369
01:01:34,475 --> 01:01:37,153
"Me!" But what about me? Marc.

370
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:39,402
What about me?

371
01:01:43,892 --> 01:01:45,646
Don't you get it?

372
01:01:47,642 --> 01:01:49,230
I love you.

373
01:01:53,642 --> 01:01:54,768
Marc!

374
01:01:58,017 --> 01:01:59,688
Leave me alone.

375
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:01,976
Please!

376
01:02:03,725 --> 01:02:06,059
I'm not sleeping with anyone else.

377
01:03:54,017 --> 01:03:57,395
- Schnitzel and chips. - Goulash, please. Half a portion.

378
01:04:05,475 --> 01:04:06,731
Thanks.

379
01:04:08,225 --> 01:04:09,481
Goulash.

380
01:04:14,142 --> 01:04:16,903
What? I won't let this faggot grab my balls.

381
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:22,559
Stop it, Kay!

382
01:04:23,475 --> 01:04:26,485
Getting all horny, huh? Who's the fag now then?

383
01:04:28,433 --> 01:04:30,271
Engel! Stop that now!

384
01:04:35,767 --> 01:04:37,153
Shit!

385
01:04:37,767 --> 01:04:39,355
It's okay.

386
01:04:40,975 --> 01:04:42,018
Seriously!

387
01:04:48,808 --> 01:04:50,360
Fucking hell.

388
01:04:52,267 --> 01:04:53,558
You okay?

389
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:58,060
- Let me take a look. - It's okay.

390
01:05:03,642 --> 01:05:05,028
Fucking morons.

391
01:05:07,600 --> 01:05:10,183
You know who started it, don't you?

392
01:05:10,558 --> 01:05:12,644
Did you see what happened?

393
01:05:14,933 --> 01:05:16,190
You have to report it.

394
01:05:18,642 --> 01:05:22,102
Come on, you know I'll get the ﬂak for that shit then.

395
01:05:24,725 --> 01:05:26,562
You can't be serious?

396
01:05:32,433 --> 01:05:35,977
When you're squad leader you can report this shit.

397
01:05:37,225 --> 01:05:39,559
But don't tell me how to do my job.

398
01:05:41,350 --> 01:05:42,855
Got it?

399
01:05:44,183 --> 01:05:46,945
- I'll take you to hospital. - I'll get a taxi.

400
01:06:12,017 --> 01:06:13,439
Shit!

401
01:06:15,892 --> 01:06:18,653
- What are you doing here? - Is it broken?

402
01:06:21,683 --> 01:06:23,603
Let's have a look.

403
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:27,893
- Ow! Are you crazy? - Ah, it's nothing. Pussy.

404
01:06:31,975 --> 01:06:34,523
You'd better go before my mum gets here.

405
01:06:41,017 --> 01:06:42,936
I'm gone already.

406
01:07:02,058 --> 01:07:03,564
Fuck!

407
01:07:05,558 --> 01:07:06,898
Shit!

408
01:07:07,100 --> 01:07:08,440
Mum!

409
01:07:10,308 --> 01:07:12,276
Mum! Wait a minute, Mum!

410
01:07:57,600 --> 01:07:59,070
Let's go.

411
01:08:12,058 --> 01:08:13,812
When did it start, Marc?

412
01:08:26,642 --> 01:08:29,107
We didn't raise you to be like that, Marc.

413
01:08:35,808 --> 01:08:37,728
How did you raise me then?

414
01:08:40,892 --> 01:08:42,693
To be like you and Dad?

415
01:08:46,267 --> 01:08:49,111
Bettina was right: moving in was a fucking bad idea!

416
01:09:21,892 --> 01:09:24,440
Why didn't you tell me he was gay?

417
01:09:27,392 --> 01:09:30,485
- How should I know? - You just notice these things.

418
01:09:31,058 --> 01:09:33,985
I mean, you share a room at the academy.

419
01:09:34,433 --> 01:09:36,436
You go running together.

420
01:09:37,350 --> 01:09:39,069
You go jogging together?

421
01:09:40,475 --> 01:09:41,861
So what?

422
01:09:42,475 --> 01:09:44,312
Is this an interrogation?

423
01:09:58,308 --> 01:10:02,231
- Aren't your parents joining us? - Doesn't look like it.

424
01:10:07,808 --> 01:10:09,858
Is your mum okay?

425
01:10:10,725 --> 01:10:13,226
She was acting all strange last night.

426
01:10:13,808 --> 01:10:15,693
I don't know.

427
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,687
OW! Shit!

428
01:10:28,600 --> 01:10:30,105
Come here.

429
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:32,023
Okay.

430
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:38,820
What's up?

431
01:10:39,517 --> 01:10:41,436
What are you looking at?

432
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:46,438
What are you looking at?

433
01:10:48,808 --> 01:10:50,527
Look at that.

434
01:10:55,267 --> 01:10:57,732
So, watch out, kids. Move over.

435
01:10:58,225 --> 01:10:59,185
And...

436
01:11:09,975 --> 01:11:12,357
Schnapps for you strong guys.

437
01:11:15,392 --> 01:11:17,229
- To us! - Thanks.

438
01:11:23,433 --> 01:11:25,187
- Congratulations. - Thanks.

439
01:11:25,392 --> 01:11:27,809
- So, cheers! - Thanks, guys.

440
01:11:28,433 --> 01:11:29,985
- Cheers. - Cheers!

441
01:11:30,183 --> 01:11:31,689
What's he doing here?

442
01:11:39,392 --> 01:11:43,647
- Have you adopted him? - We're not all as homophobic as you lot.

443
01:11:44,183 --> 01:11:47,810
- What's it like with a homo then? - Great. Jealous?

444
01:11:48,017 --> 01:11:49,226
Of that faggot?

445
01:11:50,725 --> 01:11:52,396
- Nice you made it. - Yes.

446
01:11:52,767 --> 01:11:54,272
Thanks for the invitation.

447
01:12:03,975 --> 01:12:05,694
What are you doing here?

448
01:12:05,892 --> 01:12:08,393
Do you know what we're celebrating today?

449
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,235
I'm invited.

450
01:12:11,975 --> 01:12:15,519
Look, we have nothing against you or homosexuals.

451
01:12:16,058 --> 01:12:17,978
But stay away from our son.

452
01:12:18,183 --> 01:12:20,980
- You don't understand. - No, you don't.

453
01:12:21,517 --> 01:12:24,776
They just had a baby. Do you know what that means?

454
01:12:26,183 --> 01:12:27,938
I love your son.

455
01:12:29,058 --> 01:12:32,483
- How can you say that to my face? - What's going on here?

456
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:40,435
I think it's better if you go now.

457
01:12:42,183 --> 01:12:44,317
- You're ruining everything! Everything! - Mum!

458
01:13:08,808 --> 01:13:10,977
Is there something I should know?

459
01:13:15,350 --> 01:13:17,519
- Marc. - what?

460
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:23,564
- You shouldn't have invited him. - Who? Kay?

461
01:13:26,225 --> 01:13:30,065
So now it's my fault you're all acting so strange?

462
01:13:34,308 --> 01:13:37,271
- Did he hit on you, too? - Are you crazy?

463
01:13:37,767 --> 01:13:39,402
I'm crazy, am I?

464
01:13:40,017 --> 01:13:43,477
- Come on, Bettina. I don't want to argue. - Then talk to me!

465
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:46,485
Tell me what's wrong.

466
01:13:48,517 --> 01:13:50,436
What do you want me to say?

467
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:31,310
Kay?

468
01:14:47,392 --> 01:14:50,272
What the fuck were you playing at yesterday?

469
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:54,603
Are you fucking insane?

470
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:06,059
Kay?

471
01:15:14,642 --> 01:15:15,851
Shit!

472
01:15:16,933 --> 01:15:18,522
I've looked better, huh?

473
01:15:25,808 --> 01:15:26,769
Limpinski?

474
01:15:33,350 --> 01:15:35,234
That fucking asshole.

475
01:15:39,767 --> 01:15:41,770
You have to press charges.

476
01:15:43,933 --> 01:15:45,901
Come on, you know how it works.

477
01:16:03,475 --> 01:16:06,106
Maybe you should get another transfer.

478
01:16:13,558 --> 01:16:15,312
And what about us?

479
01:17:15,808 --> 01:17:16,981
Bettina.

480
01:17:32,767 --> 01:17:36,227
- What are you doing? - I'm going to Claudia and Frank's.

481
01:17:41,892 --> 01:17:43,859
The house is all yours.

482
01:17:55,225 --> 01:17:58,105
I want you gone by the time I get back.

483
01:18:02,517 --> 01:18:04,069
Can you tell me why?

484
01:18:05,558 --> 01:18:07,064
Because you're a liar.

485
01:18:08,933 --> 01:18:10,522
I talked to Frank.

486
01:18:12,975 --> 01:18:14,978
All those night shifts.

487
01:18:15,933 --> 01:18:17,652
You weren't even there.

488
01:18:22,725 --> 01:18:25,403
You've been acting so strange lately.

489
01:18:28,058 --> 01:18:29,231
All those lies!

490
01:18:31,433 --> 01:18:33,816
All that sneaking around with Kay.

491
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:39,938
I don't know you anymore.

492
01:18:43,517 --> 01:18:45,733
What am I lying about then?

493
01:18:56,350 --> 01:18:57,690
Bettina!

494
01:18:58,350 --> 01:18:59,855
Bettina!

495
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:02,393
Don't...

496
01:19:09,350 --> 01:19:11,684
Bettina. Please don't go.

497
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:24,768
Will you stay if I tell you the truth?

498
01:19:27,433 --> 01:19:30,527
I'm almost scared to hear the truth now.

499
01:20:46,892 --> 01:20:48,444
I want to talk to Bettina.

500
01:20:49,475 --> 01:20:51,809
She doesn't want to talk to you.

501
01:20:52,475 --> 01:20:55,023
- Claudia. Please, just let me in. - Frank?

502
01:20:57,350 --> 01:20:59,234
- Yes. - Come here a minute.

503
01:21:00,350 --> 01:21:01,690
What's up?

504
01:21:10,225 --> 01:21:12,358
I think it's better if you go.

505
01:21:12,808 --> 01:21:14,811
You can't be serious...

506
01:21:16,933 --> 01:21:18,818
- I'm sorry. - Frank...

507
01:21:42,975 --> 01:21:44,729
- Come on, let me in. - No.

508
01:21:45,558 --> 01:21:47,857
- What the fuck is this? - Please, Marc.

509
01:21:51,017 --> 01:21:52,190
Bettina!

510
01:21:53,017 --> 01:21:56,560
- Bettina! I want to talk to you. - Don't make it any worse.

511
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,689
Please, Bettina!

512
01:22:07,683 --> 01:22:08,644
It's okay.

513
01:22:28,933 --> 01:22:30,320
Bettina...

514
01:22:33,017 --> 01:22:35,399
I don't want to lose you both. Please.

515
01:22:45,725 --> 01:22:47,645
I had an affair with him.

516
01:22:57,850 --> 01:22:59,818
I don't know how it happened.

517
01:23:04,308 --> 01:23:07,651
- You know I love you. - Then you'd never have fucked him.

518
01:23:19,725 --> 01:23:22,688
- Are you gay? - No, I'm not gay.

519
01:23:22,892 --> 01:23:24,895
What are you then, Marc?

520
01:23:28,642 --> 01:23:30,443
What are you then?

521
01:23:37,642 --> 01:23:39,147
Please, Bettina.

522
01:25:54,933 --> 01:25:56,320
Hi.

523
01:26:40,433 --> 01:26:41,903
Hey... Bettina.

524
01:26:42,850 --> 01:26:44,935
- What are you doing? - Tell me how.

525
01:26:45,142 --> 01:26:47,986
- Bettina! - Tell me how you like it.

526
01:26:48,183 --> 01:26:52,272
- Stop it, Bettina! - Do you want it from behind?

527
01:26:52,475 --> 01:26:55,355
- Stop... - Do you like it like that?

528
01:26:55,558 --> 01:26:57,312
Bettina, stop it!

529
01:27:04,267 --> 01:27:07,229
I can't even be properly jealous!

530
01:27:07,433 --> 01:27:09,318
Hey, he?-

531
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,809
Bettina.

532
01:27:56,892 --> 01:27:58,776
Shit.

533
01:28:00,725 --> 01:28:02,147
Shit!

534
01:28:33,892 --> 01:28:35,183
Kay?

535
01:30:14,767 --> 01:30:18,109
So that fag just did a runner then? I don't get it.

536
01:30:22,433 --> 01:30:26,060
Why did he come here anyway? He only knew you.

537
01:30:30,558 --> 01:30:32,478
I wonder what other skeletons were in his closet?

538
01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:34,978
Shut the fuck up, Gregor!

539
01:30:35,308 --> 01:30:37,027
What's up with you?

540
01:30:37,308 --> 01:30:40,935
Did Engel fuck the sense out of you? Wanna have a suck?

541
01:30:41,600 --> 01:30:45,227
- You'd like that. - Was something going on with you two?

542
01:30:46,350 --> 01:30:47,820
Jealous?

543
01:30:52,142 --> 01:30:53,730
Well, fuck me.

544
01:30:55,017 --> 01:30:56,771
That's disgusting.

545
01:30:57,350 --> 01:31:01,107
Have a feel. You fags fuck anything that com es your way.

546
01:31:02,475 --> 01:31:05,023
- What's your fucking problem? - Liked it, huh?

547
01:31:13,350 --> 01:31:16,693
Is that the best you can do? Pussy.

548
01:31:33,725 --> 01:31:35,396
Why the fuck are you smiling?

549
01:31:42,642 --> 01:31:45,522
- I won't let that faggot hit on me! - You've had it now!

550
01:31:47,475 --> 01:31:49,727
Are you okay, Marc? Get up.

551
01:31:51,308 --> 01:31:53,394
- Frank! - Beat it.

552
01:31:53,933 --> 01:31:55,983
Get out! Go!

553
01:31:58,892 --> 01:32:00,018
Marc...

554
01:34:03,267 --> 01:34:06,268
Shit!

555
01:34:13,892 --> 01:34:15,231
Shit.

556
01:34:57,183 --> 01:34:59,233
I can't go on like this.

557
01:35:07,517 --> 01:35:09,069
Me, neither.

558
01:35:17,350 --> 01:35:18,939
Me, neither.
