1
00:02:08,774 --> 00:02:11,622
I'm Anna Troyev, the art therapy instructor.

2
00:02:30,407 --> 00:02:31,782
Arms up.

3
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:42,118
I trust we won't go through this every day.

4
00:02:43,078 --> 00:02:44,454
Anna?

5
00:02:45,703 --> 00:02:48,775
Welcome, are you ready for your first day? Hmm.

6
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:50,662
I think so. Please.

7
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:56,583
Do you live far? Uh, somewhat, but it's worth it.

8
00:02:57,287 --> 00:02:59,175
Always wanted to use art to help people.

9
00:02:59,335 --> 00:03:00,295
Wonderful.

10
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:01,895
Please.

11
00:03:03,911 --> 00:03:04,903
This way.

12
00:03:05,509 --> 00:03:08,135
Those are our security procedures.

13
00:03:08,615 --> 00:03:11,206
Learn them backwards and forwards.

14
00:03:12,229 --> 00:03:14,887
Most of our patients are quite docile, but others--

15
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,997
Doctor, it's Leena.

16
00:03:17,158 --> 00:03:19,013
She's not in her room. Nobody can find her.

17
00:03:19,495 --> 00:03:21,926
Lock it.

18
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:36,454
Who's Leena?

19
00:03:37,093 --> 00:03:38,951
Our most dangerous patient.

20
00:03:39,206 --> 00:03:41,575
In fact, she's the reason for the opening you're filling.

21
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,877
Your predecessor underestimated her

22
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,990
and ignored protocol.

23
00:03:46,438 --> 00:03:47,846
Did not end well.

24
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:51,493
Listen to me. Do not leave this room.

25
00:03:51,686 --> 00:03:53,350
Don't worry. You will be safe here,

26
00:03:53,413 --> 00:03:55,142
and I 'll come back after we've found her.

27
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,902
Please, please--

28
00:04:21,413 --> 00:04:22,886
Hello, there.

29
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:31,046
Does your mum or dad work here?

30
00:04:38,054 --> 00:04:39,237
Can I see?

31
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:50,629
I-- Is that me?

32
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:54,948
That's very good.

33
00:04:56,102 --> 00:04:59,045
I'm Anna. What's your name?

34
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:08,709
Leena.

35
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:14,181
You didn't a-- answer me before.

36
00:05:14,757 --> 00:05:15,781
Do your parents work here?

37
00:05:16,293 --> 00:05:18,309
Why would you think that?

38
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:23,845
Because you're-- I'm what?

39
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:30,693
Leena?

40
00:05:38,853 --> 00:05:40,133
Put it down.

41
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:48,133
Leena, put it down, now.

42
00:06:02,597 --> 00:06:04,805
You didn't tell me she was a child.

43
00:06:05,188 --> 00:06:07,172
That's because she's not.

44
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,748
Leena suffers from a gland disorder

45
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:15,236
which causes, uh, proportional dwarfism,

46
00:06:15,491 --> 00:06:18,628
essentially halting her growth around age ten.

47
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:20,324
Make no mistake.

48
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:23,588
Leena may look like a child, but she is a grown woman.

49
00:06:24,036 --> 00:06:26,116
Thirty one, to be exact.

50
00:06:26,597 --> 00:06:28,261
When Leena first arrived,

51
00:06:28,324 --> 00:06:31,844
she struggled so hard against her restraints

52
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,756
that she would bleed severely.

53
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:37,988
It was a lesson for all of us

54
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:41,411
on the depths of her will to be free.

55
00:06:43,331 --> 00:06:45,732
Much of Leena's early life

56
00:06:45,796 --> 00:06:48,356
was spent doing whatever she could to survive.

57
00:06:48,548 --> 00:06:52,868
But she never grew older, at least not on the outside.

58
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:55,588
Imagine going through your whole life,

59
00:06:55,972 --> 00:06:57,380
the world seeing only a child.

60
00:06:57,668 --> 00:07:00,611
It is very important that you do not see her in that way.

61
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,772
Leena uses her affliction as much as she suffers from it.

62
00:07:04,836 --> 00:07:09,316
She's a exceptional con artist.

63
00:07:10,052 --> 00:07:12,548
Two years ago, Leena wormed her way

64
00:07:12,644 --> 00:07:15,939
into this family by posing as a runaway.

65
00:07:16,164 --> 00:07:19,652
This family took her in. They fed her. They clothed her.

66
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,659
Normally, Leena would simply steal whatever she could

67
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,963
and then disappear, but this time,

68
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:27,012
she, um...

69
00:07:28,676 --> 00:07:31,716
Well, let me put it this way.

70
00:07:32,484 --> 00:07:34,052
She lives here now.

71
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:58,852
Idti.

72
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:12,099
Idti!

73
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:22,339
She does that.

74
00:08:44,802 --> 00:08:46,818
How much longer have we got, Daddy?

75
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,611
We have two minutes, darling.

76
00:08:49,059 --> 00:08:50,754
You're learning me by heart, little Sara.

77
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:56,130
No, Daddy. I know you by heart. You're inside my heart.

78
00:08:59,042 --> 00:09:00,866
We're gonna be brave, aren't we?

79
00:09:02,051 --> 00:09:03,042
Yes, Daddy.

80
00:09:08,323 --> 00:09:10,530
Yes, Daddy. Hello, Dmitri.

81
00:09:13,731 --> 00:09:15,010
You're on time.

82
00:09:20,802 --> 00:09:22,786
It's perfect.

83
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:36,098
I can't tie these myself.

84
00:09:54,914 --> 00:09:57,474
I want to do something nice for you.

85
00:09:58,561 --> 00:09:59,714
You can come in.

86
00:10:01,027 --> 00:10:02,690
Yeah. Yeah. What are you doing?

87
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:32,194
My daddy has to go away. He'll return most any day.

88
00:10:38,018 --> 00:10:39,170
I can't do it.

89
00:10:43,522 --> 00:10:44,897
I can do it now.

90
00:10:45,825 --> 00:10:48,994
Any moment I may see my daddy coming back to me.

91
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:54,817
My daddy has to go away.

92
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:02,943
Idti, do you want some candy?

93
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,072
Idti!

94
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,391
She cut the feed.

95
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:11,679
I'm so sorry, Anna.

96
00:14:12,063 --> 00:14:14,240
Hopefully, the police will find her

97
00:14:14,304 --> 00:14:16,191
before anyone else is hurt.

98
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:20,864
Not quite the start we had hoped for, I'm sure.

99
00:14:22,016 --> 00:14:24,382
This job isn't for me.

100
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,661
Oh, Anna.

101
00:17:34,364 --> 00:17:36,989
It usually takes only one.

102
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,452
Huh?

103
00:18:00,062 --> 00:18:01,630
Don't be frightened. I am police.

104
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:07,868
Uh, where are your parents?

105
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,780
My parents are in America.

106
00:18:12,572 --> 00:18:15,101
Sw-- sweetheart, what is your name?

107
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:19,068

126
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:27,643
Great job, pal. Thanks, guys.

127
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:28,700
How long do you think you'll be?

128
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,092
Actually, a bunch of people are getting together tonight.

129
00:19:32,283 --> 00:19:33,435
Well, congrats.

130
00:19:33,693 --> 00:19:35,548
I'll, uh, see you guys back at the house.

131
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,612
I mean, this was supposed to be family night.

132
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:42,043
What, is he not supposed to have fun with his friends?

133
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:43,963
Oh, God. All he does is have fun.

134
00:19:44,028 --> 00:19:47,132
No, Gunnar works his tail off.

135
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,307
When he's not studying, he's fencing.

136
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,547
He's living his life.

137
00:19:54,555 --> 00:19:57,116
Don't do that. Don't go into your head.

138
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,932
I need you to be present. Gunnar needs you.

139
00:19:59,996 --> 00:20:01,820
Oh, sorry. Was I not at that match?

140
00:20:01,947 --> 00:20:03,548
Esther's not coming back, Allen.

141
00:20:05,339 --> 00:20:07,164
I miss her too. I do.

142
00:20:07,516 --> 00:20:09,948
Every moment of every day.

143
00:20:13,691 --> 00:20:15,004
What is he doing here?

144
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:27,066
Hello, Allen.

145
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,372
We have an update on your daughter Esther.

146
00:20:54,235 --> 00:20:56,123
From the little we've gotten from Esther,

147
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:58,843
we believe a woman abducted her, brought her to Russia

148
00:20:58,907 --> 00:21:00,443
and passed her off as her own child

149
00:21:00,507 --> 00:21:02,299
until Esther managed to escape.

150
00:21:02,907 --> 00:21:04,923
We haven't gotten many specifics yet.

151
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:06,587
Perhaps when she's feeling safer,

152
00:21:06,651 --> 00:21:08,795
she can shed some more light on what she's been through.

153
00:21:09,467 --> 00:21:13,275
We have a child therapist that she'll be working with.

154
00:21:13,434 --> 00:21:14,427
Good.

155
00:21:14,906 --> 00:21:16,507
What she needs right now is her family.

156
00:21:18,683 --> 00:21:20,603
Be prepared for changes.

157
00:21:21,435 --> 00:21:24,315
Four years is a long time in the development of a child.

158
00:21:44,986 --> 00:21:45,915
Esther?

159
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:51,130
Sweetheart, it's me.

160
00:21:52,954 --> 00:21:54,043
It's Mommy.

161
00:22:01,114 --> 00:22:03,482
Can I-- can I see you?

162
00:22:22,298 --> 00:22:23,770
Sweetie, it's--

163
00:22:24,089 --> 00:22:25,274
it's Mommy.

164
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,938
I thought I would never see you again.

165
00:22:36,986 --> 00:22:39,706
Everything is right, now.

166
00:22:42,554 --> 00:22:45,240
It's been so long since you've seen any of us.

167
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:49,402
Let's see if I can-- Oh, there's Daddy.

168
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:51,802
This was one of our charity events.

169
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:53,818
He looked so handsome that night, didn't he?

170
00:22:53,946 --> 00:22:55,161
Can I grab you anything else?

171
00:22:55,545 --> 00:22:56,505
No, thanks.

172
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,930
Oh, speak of the devil.

173
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:03,162
Your brother is probably a foot taller than you would remember.

174
00:23:04,922 --> 00:23:07,802
Oh, there's Mup-Mup. She's been so good to us.

175
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:09,593
Oh, I can't wait to see her.

176
00:23:11,769 --> 00:23:12,858
No, sweetie.

177
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:18,074
She passed. Remember? It's just the four of us now.

178
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,337
I have to use the restroom.

179
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:29,368
Uh, is the restroom over there?

180
00:23:29,433 --> 00:23:31,225
No, it's just right back over there.

181
00:23:31,321 --> 00:23:32,889
Over in the back? Oh. Mm-hmm.

182
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:34,745
Thank you. You're welcome.

183
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:48,985
"Can't wait to see her." So stupid.

184
00:24:11,896 --> 00:24:14,553
Oh, Daddy and Gunnar are just downstairs.

185
00:24:15,353 --> 00:24:17,496
Do you think Father will recognize me?

186
00:24:18,809 --> 00:24:22,649
Uh, maybe not if you keep calling him "father."

187
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:25,176
Dad. Yeah, that's better.

188
00:24:26,969 --> 00:24:29,465
Here. Let me look at you.

189
00:24:31,321 --> 00:24:33,049
Oh, my God. You look...

190
00:24:33,944 --> 00:24:37,272
like a little lady. You've grown up so much.

191
00:24:39,544 --> 00:24:40,952
Take this off.

192
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,632
That's better. It's less austere.

193
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:47,256
This is--

194
00:24:53,912 --> 00:24:56,824
Sorry. No, I-- I'm sorry. I--

195
00:24:57,688 --> 00:25:00,344
Come on. Let's go.

196
00:25:20,632 --> 00:25:22,872
I think I'm nervous.

197
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:25,303
All right, big step.

198
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:29,976
Daddy?

199
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:32,023
I'm so sorry.

200
00:25:33,335 --> 00:25:34,903
Can't believe it's really you.

201
00:25:44,472 --> 00:25:47,095
I always knew. I always knew.

202
00:25:52,439 --> 00:25:53,688
Hello, Gunnar.

203
00:25:54,775 --> 00:25:55,735
Hey.

204
00:25:55,991 --> 00:25:58,711
I think we could do a little bit better than, "Hey."

205
00:25:58,871 --> 00:26:01,047
Don't you think? Come.

206
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,279
Glad you're back.

207
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:09,912
Me, too.

208
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:13,688
How about we go home, huh? Yes.

209
00:26:14,263 --> 00:26:15,543
Let's go home.

210
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:58,263
Welcome home, Esther.

211
00:27:17,463 --> 00:27:19,383
We left it just as it was.

212
00:27:19,446 --> 00:27:21,366
We always knew you would come back home.

213
00:27:21,623 --> 00:27:22,807
Hmm.

214
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,432
I mean, you've probably outgrown so much,

215
00:27:25,526 --> 00:27:28,054
but we have a lot of Christmases and birthdays

216
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:28,887
to make up for,

217
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:31,830
so just let us know what you're into,

218
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:33,590
and you might get it.

219
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,046
I like painting. You like to paint?

220
00:27:37,367 --> 00:27:39,543
You were never interested in painting before.

221
00:27:39,926 --> 00:27:40,886
Well, maybe you two

222
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,743
can spend some time in your studio.

223
00:27:42,806 --> 00:27:44,182
Nothing would make me happier.

224
00:27:54,263 --> 00:27:57,015
So, um, plan is,

225
00:27:57,111 --> 00:27:58,774
tomorrow you're gonna talk to Dr. Segar.

226
00:27:59,158 --> 00:28:00,118
Do you remember her?

227
00:28:00,214 --> 00:28:04,406
She had the parrot named Sydney. Mm-hmm.

228
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:05,719
Okay.

229
00:28:06,070 --> 00:28:07,542
Well, if you need anything...

230
00:28:07,607 --> 00:28:09,174
We're right down the hall, all right?

231

00:28:51,157 --> 00:28:52,726
Okay, you can go in.

239
00:28:53,046 --> 00:28:54,293
Dr. Segar will be right with you.

240
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:55,575
I'm seeing her in a few minutes.

241
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,422
I think it's too soon for you to get involved, Detective.

242
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,310
I'd like to talk to her alone first.

243
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,093
Look, I have to go.

244
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,109
You have no idea

245
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,189
how happy I am to see you, Esther.

246
00:29:19,702 --> 00:29:21,045
Welcome home.

247
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:25,717
Well, now, you're certainly not the little girl I once knew.

248
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:27,701
You're a young lady now.

249
00:29:29,525 --> 00:29:30,485
Do you remember what I told you

250
00:29:30,549 --> 00:29:32,341
when we first began our sessions?

251
00:29:34,134 --> 00:29:35,349
I told you if I ask any questions

252
00:29:35,413 --> 00:29:37,686
that make you uncomfortable, we'll stop.

253
00:29:38,357 --> 00:29:40,308
I wish my parents were like you.

254
00:29:41,493 --> 00:29:42,485
How so?

255
00:29:42,742 --> 00:29:44,661
They keep asking what happened to me,

256
00:29:44,981 --> 00:29:47,636
but I'm not ready to tell them about it.

257
00:29:47,797 --> 00:29:49,141
And that's perfectly fine.

258
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:51,286
I am hoping you'll talk to me about it,

259
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,652
but only when you're ready, okay?

260
00:29:54,452 --> 00:29:55,797
Having said that,

261
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:57,781
is there anything you want to tell me

262
00:29:57,878 --> 00:30:00,085
about your time away?

263
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,910
You want to play, Sydney?

264
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:04,341
I think Sydney wants to play with me.

265
00:30:04,437 --> 00:30:06,836
Hello, I remember you.

266
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:08,438
You remember me?

267
00:30:10,358 --> 00:30:12,245
Your turn. Esther, you can wait out here.

268
00:30:12,374 --> 00:30:14,645
I'm just going to need to talk to your mom for a moment.

269
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,236
Hello. Hi.

270
00:30:33,749 --> 00:30:34,836
I like your earrings.

271
00:30:35,125 --> 00:30:36,756
Oh, thank you, honey.

272
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:40,820
What are you writing? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

273
00:30:40,885 --> 00:30:42,548
It's okay. I'm sorry.

274
00:30:42,676 --> 00:30:44,596
Let me go get this cleaned up.

275
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:56,020
She seem the same as you remember?

276
00:30:56,244 --> 00:30:57,204
Different?

277
00:30:57,621 --> 00:31:01,012
Well, of course she's different.

278
00:31:01,333 --> 00:31:02,772
She has an accent now.

279
00:31:03,475 --> 00:31:06,388
Is that unusual, considering where she's been?

280
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:09,204
Not necessarily.

281
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,837
She was there a long time when her speech

282
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:12,308
was still developing.

283
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,995
But I will tell you, she is in far better shape

284
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:17,620
intellectually and emotionally than I would expect.

285
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:19,444
Well, that's good, right?

286
00:31:24,691 --> 00:31:26,740
I did notice some inconsistencies.

287
00:31:26,964 --> 00:31:28,981
For example, she said that was Sydney.

288
00:31:29,364 --> 00:31:30,419
Sydney was a macaw.

289
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:32,500
Bright orange and four times the size.

290
00:31:32,595 --> 00:31:34,644
Yet, today, she addressed this bird as Sydney

291
00:31:34,708 --> 00:31:37,524
with complete confidence. What are you getting at?

292
00:31:37,717 --> 00:31:39,315
To me, it felt like a performance.

293
00:31:43,251 --> 00:31:45,236
He hit me and ripped my dress!

294
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,317
I want to go home.

295
00:31:48,437 --> 00:31:49,428
That's enough for today.

296
00:31:49,523 --> 00:31:51,188
Uh, of course. We'll reschedule.

297
00:32:10,067 --> 00:32:12,819
Esther, you all right? Uh, yes.

298
00:32:23,956 --> 00:32:25,427
Hey.

299
00:32:25,812 --> 00:32:28,275
Morticia, get Gunnar for me, would you?

300
00:32:28,596 --> 00:32:32,244
What did you call me? Mike, that's her. The sister.

301
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,747
Oh, shit.

302
00:32:33,810 --> 00:32:37,939
It's my bad. Um, get Gunnar, pozálujsta.

303
00:32:45,651 --> 00:32:47,892
Is that Spanish or something? I don't--

304
00:32:47,956 --> 00:32:49,330
Hey, let's go.

305
00:32:49,939 --> 00:32:51,315
Your sister's a fuckin' trip, man.

306
00:32:51,444 --> 00:32:53,331
Seriously, dude? My dad is right there.

307
00:32:53,427 --> 00:32:54,930
I don't care. Mike!

308
00:32:55,699 --> 00:32:57,682
Fucking idiot. I am what I am.

309
00:32:58,196 --> 00:33:00,658
Hey, honey, you okay?

310
00:33:01,363 --> 00:33:04,116
Uh, my dress is ruined. I'll buy you a new one.

311
00:33:04,467 --> 00:33:05,554
I was thinking, uh,

312
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,027
I was thinking we could go to the studio.

313
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,820
I would love to.

314
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:20,691
If I didn't know any better,

315
00:33:20,850 --> 00:33:22,323
I'd think you'd never been in here before.

316
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:27,506
So beautiful.

317
00:33:31,987 --> 00:33:33,394
What's the light for?

318
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:35,859
What's the light for? Mm-hmm.

319
00:33:37,234 --> 00:33:39,444
You don't remember? It's what your papa's famous for.

320
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:41,364
Hmm.

321
00:33:41,459 --> 00:33:42,419
Here.

322
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:45,235
Press on this.

323
00:33:50,963 --> 00:33:53,586
Yeah, I always tried to fit so much into one canvas,

324
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,915
you know? So, I resorted to a-- a hidden layer.

325
00:33:57,747 --> 00:33:59,571
Nothing is ever just one thing, right?

326
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:01,073
So cool.

327
00:34:02,803 --> 00:34:04,466
You haven't been in here in a while.

328
00:34:05,522 --> 00:34:06,578
No, I haven't.

329
00:34:10,738 --> 00:34:11,922
What's this one?

330
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:17,939
Oh, no.

331
00:34:19,635 --> 00:34:21,842
It's, uh, I should've gotten rid of this.

332
00:34:22,322 --> 00:34:23,858
Who-- who's-- who's that?

333
00:34:25,169 --> 00:34:26,450
There's no use dwelling on the past.

334
00:34:26,546 --> 00:34:28,562
You're home now. That's all that matters, right?

335
00:34:30,675 --> 00:34:32,817
So, I was thinking we could dust off some canvasses, you know?

336
00:34:32,882 --> 00:34:33,873
See what comes of it.

337
00:34:33,937 --> 00:34:35,154
I would love to. Yeah?

338
00:34:35,697 --> 00:34:38,290
Um, what's your poison? Oil, watercolors?

339
00:34:38,355 --> 00:34:39,986
I-- I got it all. Charcoal?

340
00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:41,521
Charcoal? Okay.

341
00:34:41,683 --> 00:34:44,050
Pick an object, and-- and we'll sit down

342
00:34:44,115 --> 00:34:45,714
and we'll-- we'll draw it together.

343
00:34:46,674 --> 00:34:47,794
I want to draw you.

344
00:34:49,746 --> 00:34:51,186
You want to draw me? Mm-hmm.

345
00:34:51,538 --> 00:34:52,594
Yeah, okay.

346
00:34:55,666 --> 00:34:57,074
Well, this is a first.

347
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,123
How do you want me?

348
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:00,753
I can-- I can do The Thinker.

349
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:03,505
The way you were when you were looking at that.

350
00:35:05,330 --> 00:35:07,026
That's not a place I want to live anymore.

351
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:08,946
There.

352
00:35:09,778 --> 00:35:10,897
Just like that.

353
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:19,282
You learned to paint while you were over there?

354
00:35:19,698 --> 00:35:20,913
Mm-hmm.

355
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:27,986
Would you just draw, or was it-- was it also--

356
00:35:28,081 --> 00:35:29,393
It wasn't what you think.

357
00:35:31,281 --> 00:35:32,722
It's still happening, despite everything

358
00:35:32,785 --> 00:35:36,402
that's going on. Allen? No, he won't be there.

359
00:35:36,465 --> 00:35:38,322
You know how he feels about these things.

360
00:35:38,545 --> 00:35:40,817
So, I'll see you at the gala tomorrow, then, okay?

361
00:35:40,881 --> 00:35:41,968
It's for a good cause.

362
00:35:42,225 --> 00:35:45,073
Beth, just bring your checkbook and Jim.

363
00:35:45,169 --> 00:35:47,281
It's for pediatric cancer, for Christ's sake.

364
00:35:47,632 --> 00:35:50,608
Okay, that's better. Thank you.

365
00:35:58,288 --> 00:35:59,281
I'm finished.

366
00:35:59,377 --> 00:36:00,785
Already? Mm-hmm.

367
00:36:06,928 --> 00:36:08,530
Do you like it? I love it.

368
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,354
It's-- it's incredible.

369
00:36:10,962 --> 00:36:12,977
Okay, 30 seconds, all right?

370
00:36:13,073 --> 00:36:14,962
And then we're gonna see what you can do with paint.

371
00:36:52,401 --> 00:36:55,088
That's private. Oh, I'm sorry.

372
00:36:55,217 --> 00:36:57,264
I-- I saw that you brought it back with you.

373
00:36:57,329 --> 00:36:58,993
I thought it was special. You don't knock?

374
00:36:59,953 --> 00:37:03,216
I was looking for, um, my gold watch.

375
00:37:03,567 --> 00:37:05,808
I-- It's okay. I'm sure it'll turn up.

376
00:37:06,033 --> 00:37:07,025
Sorry.

377
00:37:31,984 --> 00:37:33,488
"Property of Esther."

378
00:37:36,272 --> 00:37:37,936
"Mummy took me to Wicked."

379
00:37:38,192 --> 00:37:41,104
"Mummy." Hello, Mummy.

380
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:43,536
Thank you, Mummy.

381
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:47,120
I know, Mummy.

382
00:37:48,144 --> 00:37:49,136
Mummy.

383
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,624
Mummy.

384
00:37:59,376 --> 00:38:01,103
You're not gonna believe what Esther can do.

385
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,216
We spent the afternoon in the studio.

386
00:38:04,176 --> 00:38:05,552
She drew a portrait of me.

387
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:08,815
She's got more talent than I had when I was in my 20s.

388
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,160
How's that possible?

389
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:12,368
Four years ago, she was still drawing stick figures.

390
00:38:12,432 --> 00:38:13,647
Easy. What?

391
00:38:13,744 --> 00:38:15,600
Think about where you were four years ago.

392
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,600
Now you're a fencing champion. Yeah, just-- It's impressive.

393
00:38:19,919 --> 00:38:20,656
Hmm.

394
00:38:20,879 --> 00:38:22,480
Maybe you can make a portrait of me.

395
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,815
This is delicious, Mummy.

396
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:27,087
Thank you.

397
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:30,960
Is something wrong?

398
00:38:32,112 --> 00:38:34,223
No, no. I'm just--

399
00:38:35,504 --> 00:38:36,880
You expecting someone?

400
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,391
I thought I'd pop in to...

401
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,632
Look who came for a visit.

402
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:49,743
Oh, I'm sorry to interrupt dinner.

403
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:51,695
This is a police officer

404
00:38:51,759 --> 00:38:53,327
who helped us when you went missing.

405
00:38:53,423 --> 00:38:54,191
He's a friend.

406
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:57,167
I just, uh, came to say welcome home, Esther.

407
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,151
Thank you.

408
00:39:02,191 --> 00:39:03,951
Excuse me for a moment.

409
00:39:08,495 --> 00:39:11,471
You should know, um, our child psychologist feels

410
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:14,479
Esther should tell her story within the confines of--

411
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:16,047
And not with a cop like me.

412
00:39:16,144 --> 00:39:17,519
Don't worry. I get it.

413
00:39:17,935 --> 00:39:20,718
But Esther did vanish from our little town,

414
00:39:20,815 --> 00:39:22,671
and that remains a concern.

415
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:25,615
I need to know if there's still a danger.

416
00:39:26,543 --> 00:39:28,782
I spoke to Dr. Segar this morning.

417
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:31,662
Is that appropriate?

418
00:39:31,919 --> 00:39:33,071
She told me she's open

419
00:39:33,135 --> 00:39:35,246
to group discussion tomorrow morning,

420
00:39:35,343 --> 00:39:37,103
just to see if everything's all right.

421
00:39:37,263 --> 00:39:40,366
Mummy, your gala is tomorrow.

422
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:45,006
We'll do it the following day, then.

423
00:39:45,167 --> 00:39:45,966
It's important.

424
00:39:46,223 --> 00:39:48,783
I mean, sure. If it's that important, we'll be there.

425
00:39:51,407 --> 00:39:53,007
You forgot to fill your glass.

426
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:59,599
Well, uh, welcome home, Esther.

427
00:40:00,143 --> 00:40:01,134
You said that already.

428
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,631
Esther-- Oh, it's okay. She's right.

429
00:40:04,143 --> 00:40:05,614
I'll walk you out.

430
00:40:36,238 --> 00:40:37,518
I'm sorry you live here.

431
00:41:32,013 --> 00:41:33,198
Yeah.

432
00:41:34,382 --> 00:41:35,853
I think I'll stay here for a while.

433
00:42:05,677 --> 00:42:08,396
I think something's going on with Dr. Segar.

434
00:42:08,717 --> 00:42:10,606
She seemed to be implying in our last meeting

435
00:42:10,669 --> 00:42:13,292
that Esther is lying.

436
00:42:13,741 --> 00:42:15,021
That's insane.

437
00:42:15,629 --> 00:42:17,453
Maybe she needs to see a therapist.

438
00:42:17,517 --> 00:42:18,765
I know, right?

439
00:42:19,917 --> 00:42:22,700
What-- what is this?

440
00:42:22,990 --> 00:42:24,014
Your date.

441
00:42:24,237 --> 00:42:25,772
You're coming? Yeah, of course I'm coming.

442
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:28,782
You're my wife. I can deal with a few rich pricks for you.

443
00:42:29,197 --> 00:42:30,253
And what about Esther?

444
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:32,557
Well, Gunnar's here. She'll be fine, right?

445
00:42:33,004 --> 00:42:34,316
What, do you want me to stay home?

446
00:42:34,478 --> 00:42:35,948
No, no.

447
00:42:38,093 --> 00:42:42,477
Oh, you know, it seems like since we got Esther back,

448
00:42:43,404 --> 00:42:44,940
we got us back, too.

449
00:42:45,997 --> 00:42:47,277
I couldn't agree more.

450
00:42:48,076 --> 00:42:49,613
How long do you need to get dressed?

451
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:51,500
I can be quick. Yeah?

452
00:42:54,061 --> 00:42:56,140
I can be quick, too.

453
00:43:02,764 --> 00:43:05,132
I'm sorry, but they're cute.

454
00:43:33,037 --> 00:43:34,348
Let's just close the door.

455
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:40,652
Just close the door.

456
00:43:40,876 --> 00:43:46,315
What? No. No, no, no!

457
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,501
Oh, my God.

458
00:43:47,565 --> 00:43:49,292
Do you know how much I spent on this dress?

459
00:43:50,476 --> 00:43:51,916
Let me look. Oh, man.

460
00:43:52,044 --> 00:43:53,132
I can fix that.

461
00:43:53,483 --> 00:43:55,884
With a safety pin. Right, or staples.

462
00:43:55,948 --> 00:43:57,196
Staples would work.

463
00:44:01,869 --> 00:44:04,012
You're responsible for looking after your sister

464
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:06,860
while we're gone. We're trusting you, okay?

465
00:44:06,923 --> 00:44:08,172
Yeah, Dad. I got it.

466
00:44:09,932 --> 00:44:11,212
You look incredible.

467
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:13,003
We're off.

468
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,956
Probably won't be home until after midnight, okay?

469
00:44:15,019 --> 00:44:16,907
So, don't let her stay up too late.

470
00:44:17,739 --> 00:44:18,476
You have the keys?

471
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:19,819
Copy that. Hmm.

472
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:29,323
You look nice. Thanks.

473
00:44:31,339 --> 00:44:32,332
Have a good night, honey.

474
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:34,699
Ciao. Night.

475
00:44:39,276 --> 00:44:40,811
So what are we going to do?

476
00:44:41,867 --> 00:44:44,779

477

482
00:45:09,611 --> 00:45:11,211
I was holding onto it for too long.

483
00:45:11,307 --> 00:45:12,811
Okay. So, Gunnar,

484
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:14,731
is your sister different than you remember?

485
00:45:14,924 --> 00:45:16,171
I mean-- What do you think?

486
00:45:16,235 --> 00:45:18,668
She's been at some Eastern European sex gulag.

487
00:45:18,764 --> 00:45:20,428
Mike.

488
00:45:20,491 --> 00:45:23,178
But, uh, yeah. No, she, uh, she's different, all right.

489
00:45:23,275 --> 00:45:25,163
She's got an accent now.

490
00:45:25,451 --> 00:45:27,148
And she dresses like Lizzie Borden.

491
00:45:27,244 --> 00:45:28,811
It's so fucking weird.

492
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:30,602
Who's Lizzie Borden?

493
00:45:33,322 --> 00:45:34,731
♪ Sha la-la la... ♪

494
00:45:34,891 --> 00:45:37,964
Some crazy chick who killed her parents with an axe.

495
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:39,755
Uh, hey, Esther,

496
00:45:40,395 --> 00:45:44,267
why don't you, uh, go watch a movie or something?

497
00:45:44,428 --> 00:45:45,484
No.

498
00:45:45,866 --> 00:45:48,235
Esther, this isn't your scene.

499
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,434
Go watch a movie. Go fuck yourself.

500
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,410
Hey, Gunnar, you know what? I like her.

501
00:45:54,539 --> 00:45:56,266
Oh.

502
00:45:58,442 --> 00:45:59,498
Go.

503
00:46:02,122 --> 00:46:04,074
Anyway, cheers! Cheers.

504
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:05,547
Yeah. I'll fucking drink to that.

505
00:46:09,002 --> 00:46:10,890
Um, what we were talking about?

506
00:46:10,986 --> 00:46:12,810
Who's that?

507
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,099
Evening.

508
00:46:18,539 --> 00:46:22,123
Hey, my parents aren't here. They're at Mom's gala.

509
00:46:22,698 --> 00:46:24,522
Just my luck. Yeah.

510
00:46:24,811 --> 00:46:25,963
Having a party?

511
00:46:26,058 --> 00:46:27,946
No, it's just a few friends.

512
00:46:28,010 --> 00:46:29,994
Smell the weed from the street.

513
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:32,587
What? Um, I don't know--

514
00:46:32,650 --> 00:46:33,674
I don't know what you're talking about.

515
00:46:33,738 --> 00:46:37,866
Um, look, nothing's going on here, okay?

516
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:39,882
So um, why don't I just tell my parents

517
00:46:39,946 --> 00:46:43,370
that you stopped by, and we can just forget all about this.

518
00:46:43,914 --> 00:46:45,194
Cool?

519
00:46:45,706 --> 00:46:47,754
Cool. Good.

520
00:46:49,161 --> 00:46:52,105
You mind if I hit the restroom before I go?

521
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:55,241
Yeah, whatever. Yeah, sure.

522
00:48:11,434 --> 00:48:12,648
That was a blast.

523
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,633
No wonder those uptight millionaires line up

524
00:48:14,697 --> 00:48:16,424
to give the foundation money.

525
00:48:17,033 --> 00:48:18,218
Oh, no. It's the booze.

526
00:48:18,282 --> 00:48:20,680
It's not the booze, hon.

527
00:48:21,033 --> 00:48:22,026
It's the host.

528
00:48:22,248 --> 00:48:23,657
You bring the best out of people.

529
00:48:23,882 --> 00:48:25,032
Aw.

530
00:48:41,834 --> 00:48:43,754
I just hope the house is still standing.

531
00:48:43,817 --> 00:48:44,616
Ugh.

532
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:47,817
I mean, when I was 16, I-- I nearly...

533
00:48:48,104 --> 00:48:49,866
...I nearly burnt the house down.

534
00:48:50,184 --> 00:48:51,689
No, Gunnar would never do that.

535
00:48:51,882 --> 00:48:53,513
Who says I'm talking about Gunnar?

536
00:48:58,409 --> 00:48:59,880
Esther, we're home.

537
00:49:01,512 --> 00:49:03,432
Esther?

538
00:49:57,032 --> 00:49:58,536
"Saarne Institute?"

539
00:50:10,153 --> 00:50:11,208
Esther?

540
00:51:55,783 --> 00:51:58,791
If you're not Esther, who the hell are you?

541
00:52:14,311 --> 00:52:16,421
How did you know that I'm not Esther?

542
00:52:21,895 --> 00:52:23,623
Her own mother doesn't even know.

543
00:52:24,327 --> 00:52:27,686
Yeah, kid, she does.

544
00:52:37,255 --> 00:52:38,469
Damn it.

545
00:52:39,078 --> 00:52:40,038
Mummy?

546
00:52:40,999 --> 00:52:42,405
The fuck are you looking at?

547
00:52:46,055 --> 00:52:47,527
So, let me get this straight.

548
00:52:48,551 --> 00:52:51,527
You're a grown-ass woman and a wanted criminal?

549
00:52:52,646 --> 00:52:55,781
That is beyond fucked up.

550
00:52:59,046 --> 00:53:01,509
This is all I ever do anymore, by the way.

551
00:53:02,054 --> 00:53:03,303
Clean up after my kids.

552
00:53:03,557 --> 00:53:06,022
Don't worry about it. Mommy'll take care of it.

553
00:53:06,214 --> 00:53:07,910
Mommy takes care of everything.

554
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:11,109
When Gunnar told me Donnan came to the house,

555
00:53:11,173 --> 00:53:12,647
I knew I'd find you here.

556
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,005
You could have robbed us blind and disappeared

557
00:53:16,102 --> 00:53:19,494
the second you had a chance, but you didn't.

558
00:53:21,158 --> 00:53:22,214
Why is that?

559
00:53:23,238 --> 00:53:28,517
You're thinking bigger, right? Play the part, manipulate us,

560
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:31,974
and a year from now we meet with some tragic accident.

561
00:53:32,325 --> 00:53:33,573
Am I getting warm?

562
00:53:34,022 --> 00:53:36,742
Let me go. You'll never see me again.

563
00:53:37,061 --> 00:53:38,662
That's exactly what I'm afraid of.

564
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:42,086
We can't have Esther disappear twice now, can we?

565
00:53:42,917 --> 00:53:44,422
She didn't disappear.

566
00:53:44,934 --> 00:53:47,174
There was nothing that I could do for her,

567
00:53:47,717 --> 00:53:49,030
it was too late.

568
00:53:50,214 --> 00:53:54,149
Gunnar, he was always way too rough with her.

569
00:53:54,534 --> 00:53:58,374
That night he just went too far. What was I supposed to do?

570
00:53:59,108 --> 00:54:01,989
Hand over the only child I had left over some

571
00:54:02,406 --> 00:54:04,678
sibling bullshit that went too far?

572
00:54:05,221 --> 00:54:07,654
I loved my daughter with all my heart,

573
00:54:08,293 --> 00:54:10,790
but a mother protects her family, no matter what,

574
00:54:11,173 --> 00:54:14,661
and if you think... ...that I'm going to let some

575
00:54:14,821 --> 00:54:18,340
psycho dwarf destroy what I have built...

576
00:54:20,005 --> 00:54:20,965
you're mistaken.

577
00:54:21,445 --> 00:54:23,365
This family came over on the fucking Mayflower

578
00:54:23,430 --> 00:54:27,622
and built this country. We matter. Allen matters.

579
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:29,860
When he got the news Esther was alive,

580
00:54:30,277 --> 00:54:33,797
the happiness on his face, I had to make this work.

581
00:54:35,141 --> 00:54:37,540
Allen doesn't know what happened to Esther.

582
00:54:37,765 --> 00:54:40,614
And you are gonna help me make sure that he never does.

583
00:54:41,189 --> 00:54:44,421
There's only one thing worse than the death of a child,

584
00:54:44,773 --> 00:54:46,822
and that is a child who is missing.

585
00:54:46,917 --> 00:54:50,629
Esther's disappearance changed Allen,

586
00:54:51,045 --> 00:54:54,533
changed who he was, who he is supposed to be,

587
00:54:55,013 --> 00:55:00,037
but you are the answer.

588
00:55:04,485 --> 00:55:06,789
You and I have a chance to turn this mess

589
00:55:06,853 --> 00:55:08,837
into a mutually beneficial arrangement.

590
00:55:09,509 --> 00:55:11,269
Esther's down there, isn't she?

591
00:55:14,693 --> 00:55:16,421
Don't you fucking say her name.

592
00:55:17,604 --> 00:55:18,564
Okay.

593
00:55:18,853 --> 00:55:20,933
You conned your way into my family.

594
00:55:21,348 --> 00:55:22,628
You chose this role,

595
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:24,805
and now you're gonna fucking play it.

596
00:55:32,901 --> 00:55:36,133
So, you can be Esther for now,

597
00:55:36,293 --> 00:55:38,821
and live a life that anyone would kill to have,

598
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:40,356
or you take the fall for this

599
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:43,044
and get shipped back to Estonia in handcuffs.

600
00:55:43,652 --> 00:55:44,900
What do you say?

601
00:55:59,236 --> 00:56:01,828
I'm sorry I scared you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

602
00:56:01,924 --> 00:56:03,460
We should have never left you alone.

603
00:56:05,636 --> 00:56:07,716
What happened? She fell off her bike.

604
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:08,996
I found her by the side of the road.

605
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:11,588
Honey, what are you doing on a bike?

606
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:13,380
Come here, let's-- let's get warm.

607
00:56:13,444 --> 00:56:15,459
Mom, I'm so sorry. Stop.

608
00:56:16,964 --> 00:56:20,420
What the fuck? Yeah.

609
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,052
So what does this mean?

610
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:24,068
Well, it means she's not a kid.

611
00:56:24,228 --> 00:56:27,716
She is a grown woman and we cannot underestimate her.

612
00:56:27,812 --> 00:56:28,900
No, she's more than that, Mother.

613
00:56:29,028 --> 00:56:31,748
She's a psychopath living in our fucking house.

614
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:36,196
So we just have to live with this person?

615
00:56:36,323 --> 00:56:40,067
I didn't say that. So then, can we just, you know?

616
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,428
Make it look like an accident.

617
00:56:44,132 --> 00:56:46,883
It's too soon. We need to think about this.

618
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,515
So she just owns us now?

619
00:56:48,611 --> 00:56:51,172
No, no, she has just as much to lose as we do.

620
00:56:51,524 --> 00:56:53,988
Look, neither of us were expecting this.

621
00:56:54,179 --> 00:56:56,068
So, for now we just keep an eye on her,

622
00:56:56,195 --> 00:56:58,211
and when the time is right, we'll end it.

623
00:56:58,788 --> 00:57:01,795
This is insane, even for us.

624
00:57:43,907 --> 00:57:45,731
Okay, see that? It's gonna fire.

625
00:57:45,827 --> 00:57:47,970
Uh-huh. Pull it back. Just like that.

626
00:57:48,163 --> 00:57:50,915
And you get the bow, flip it in, slide it.

627
00:57:51,779 --> 00:57:53,635
See this? Are you watching? Yeah.

628
00:57:53,763 --> 00:57:54,819
Yeah, and you--

629
00:57:55,204 --> 00:57:56,196
Nice!

630
00:57:56,291 --> 00:57:57,283
You see that? Yeah, yeah.

631
00:57:57,347 --> 00:57:58,371
That's what I'm talking about.

632
00:57:58,659 --> 00:58:00,483
Our meeting with Dr. Segar is today.

633
00:58:00,579 --> 00:58:02,083
A problem we wouldn't have if you hadn't talked

634
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:03,523
to the parrot.

635
00:58:03,586 --> 00:58:05,475
Sydney was a macaw. Oh.

636
00:58:06,051 --> 00:58:07,811
All macaws are parrots,

637
00:58:08,259 --> 00:58:10,627
but not all fucking parrots are macaws.

638
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:14,723
What are we gonna do about that?

639
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:19,522
Oh, we make her believe. Together.

640
00:58:20,610 --> 00:58:23,106
One of our goals here is helping Esther acclimate

641
00:58:23,171 --> 00:58:24,996
back into life within the family unit.

642
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,202
Part of that is remembering your shared history.

643
00:58:27,586 --> 00:58:30,691
Moments you had, the fun things you did together before.

644
00:58:30,947 --> 00:58:33,283
Mr. Albright, what's a memory that means a lot

645
00:58:33,346 --> 00:58:34,531
to you and to Esther?

646
00:58:34,596 --> 00:58:37,476
Oh, God, there are so many.

647
00:58:37,858 --> 00:58:41,283
Um, there was Christmas in Paris.

648
00:58:41,442 --> 00:58:42,818
The summer in Tuscany.

649
00:58:42,914 --> 00:58:45,218
Yellowstone. Yeah, that's up there.

650
00:58:45,507 --> 00:58:46,562
I was six.

651
00:58:47,427 --> 00:58:50,467
We saw bears and a-- a chipmunk stole my sandwich.

652
00:58:50,916 --> 00:58:53,058
Oh, my God. There were so many chipmunks.

653
00:58:53,122 --> 00:58:55,620
What else, Esther? Be specific.

654
00:58:55,842 --> 00:58:58,467
We stayed at Elk Ridge Ranch and rode horses.

655
00:58:58,754 --> 00:59:00,387
Mine was a pony named Nugget

656
00:59:00,451 --> 00:59:01,570
and Daddy's horse was called Stretch,

657
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:05,219
and this one time when Stretch leaned down to eat grass,

658
00:59:05,283 --> 00:59:07,650
Daddy fell right over his head onto the ground.

659
00:59:08,001 --> 00:59:10,210
He had dirt all over his face. It was even in his teeth!

660
00:59:10,273 --> 00:59:12,066
I can't believe you're telling this story.

661
00:59:12,162 --> 00:59:14,146
Oh, my God. It was in your teeth for days.

662
00:59:15,585 --> 00:59:18,786
In summary, Esther exhibits a healthy outlook on life,

663
00:59:19,106 --> 00:59:21,314
especially re-entering into this family unit.

664
00:59:21,890 --> 00:59:23,682
She is highly functioning,

665
00:59:24,386 --> 00:59:25,666
emotionally well.

666
00:59:26,818 --> 00:59:28,738
That is all.

667
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:32,163
There are people coming over today

668
00:59:32,290 --> 00:59:33,634
just to see you.

669
00:59:35,393 --> 00:59:38,017
They're friends of ours who knew Esther.

670
00:59:38,082 --> 00:59:41,090
So enough with the glowering, okay?

671
00:59:41,986 --> 00:59:44,289
Esther is a lady.

672
00:59:45,345 --> 00:59:47,009
Hmm.

673
00:59:48,193 --> 00:59:51,713
I think I'm gonna have to do some damage.

674
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,385
Okay.

675
00:59:58,657 --> 00:59:59,809
Think we did good.

676
01:00:00,065 --> 01:00:02,306
Everyone expects Esther to be broken.

677
01:00:02,562 --> 01:00:05,281
What they really want is a happy ending.

678
01:00:05,825 --> 01:00:06,913
We are gonna pretend

679
01:00:07,266 --> 01:00:09,665
that pink is your favorite color.

680
01:00:10,017 --> 01:00:10,913
Ooh, velvet.

681
01:00:11,458 --> 01:00:15,745
The secret is to give them a story they want to believe.

682
01:00:16,065 --> 01:00:18,625
This one is my favorite.

683
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:21,281
What's your favorite color? Pink.

684
01:00:21,345 --> 01:00:22,722
Very, very good.

685
01:00:24,481 --> 01:00:29,313
Now, you say you can paint. What else can you do?

686
01:00:44,673 --> 01:00:46,753
I missed my family very much.

687
01:00:46,818 --> 01:00:48,930
It's lovely to be back.

688
01:00:49,089 --> 01:00:51,361
And what are your plans now, young lady?

689
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,041
What are my plans, Mummy?

690
01:00:55,905 --> 01:00:57,378
Absolutely nothing.

691
01:00:57,825 --> 01:01:00,161
I'm not letting you out of my sight.

692
01:01:00,576 --> 01:01:03,041
Aw.

693
01:01:23,201 --> 01:01:24,736
So let me get this straight...

694
01:01:26,401 --> 01:01:27,489
you're 30?

695
01:01:27,808 --> 01:01:29,121
Get out of my room now, please.

696
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:32,001
It's not your room. It's my dead sister's room.

697
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:34,049
You're not her and you never will be.

698
01:01:34,272 --> 01:01:36,289
Is that perfectly clear? Fuck off.

699
01:01:36,352 --> 01:01:38,144
Watch your mouth, freak.

700
01:01:39,136 --> 01:01:40,864
You know, I'm glad everything's out in the open now,

701
01:01:40,928 --> 01:01:43,040
'cause I'm done pretending like you belong here.

702
01:01:43,296 --> 01:01:44,288
You don't.

703
01:01:45,185 --> 01:01:49,600
This is my house, my family, it'll never be yours.

704
01:01:50,305 --> 01:01:51,329
As long as you're under this roof,

705
01:01:51,393 --> 01:01:52,928
you and I will have an understanding.

706
01:01:53,536 --> 01:01:54,656
Here's what it is.

707
01:01:57,216 --> 01:01:59,809
I fucking own you.

708
01:02:01,825 --> 01:02:03,968
Do that again and I'll kill you like I killed Esther.

709
01:02:07,936 --> 01:02:08,960
One call from me,

710
01:02:09,024 --> 01:02:10,944
and you're right back in that gulag.

711
01:02:11,264 --> 01:02:12,480
You'd go down, too.

712
01:02:12,736 --> 01:02:15,584
Why, because of what the illegal immigrant, fugitive,

713
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,120
mental patient said?

714
01:02:18,528 --> 01:02:19,551
Good luck with that.

715
01:02:22,687 --> 01:02:23,777
This is America.

716
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:26,144
People like me matter,

717
01:02:26,688 --> 01:02:27,745
and if you're not Esther,

718
01:02:27,809 --> 01:02:29,568
that just means Esther's missing again.

719
01:02:29,855 --> 01:02:31,457
Mom has a problem with that.

720
01:02:32,673 --> 01:02:33,855
I don't.

721
01:02:34,529 --> 01:02:35,775
See you later, freak.

722
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:45,183
You are gonna sleep like a fucking baby tonight.

723
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:51,713
I made roast lamb with rosemary and tapenade.

724
01:02:52,063 --> 01:02:53,536
And I know Esther doesn't like it,

725
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:54,656
so I made your favorite.

726
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,087
Aw, just like the old days.

727
01:02:57,184 --> 01:02:58,432
I'm really excited about going

728
01:02:58,497 --> 01:02:59,775
into the city tomorrow.

729
01:03:01,120 --> 01:03:03,200
I'm gonna show the gallery what I've been working on.

730
01:03:03,968 --> 01:03:05,343
That sounds wonderful.

731
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,679
Well, it's all thanks to you. Oh.

732
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:10,143
I rediscovered the joy I once felt doing what I love.

733
01:03:10,207 --> 01:03:12,287
I feel like a kid again. You want to come?

734
01:03:12,351 --> 01:03:13,343
I would love to!

735
01:03:13,406 --> 01:03:16,063
Oh, Esther and I already have plans.

736
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,910
Oh. What plans?

737
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,184
It's a surprise.

738
01:03:21,695 --> 01:03:24,480
Okay, well, another time then.

739
01:03:24,959 --> 01:03:26,463
It's great that you're painting again, Dad.

740
01:03:26,527 --> 01:03:28,064
Well, yeah.

741
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:30,816
May I be excused?

742
01:03:31,232 --> 01:03:32,511
Oh, don't forget your--

743
01:03:33,247 --> 01:03:34,816
You can eat upstairs. It's okay.

744
01:03:36,928 --> 01:03:38,752
Honey, hey, what's wrong?

745
01:03:38,879 --> 01:03:39,839
Dad, she's fine.

746
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:41,568
Just give her some space. She's fine.

747
01:03:41,632 --> 01:03:44,352
Yeah, she's probably tired from all that piano playing.

748
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,815
Can I come in? Mm-hmm.

749
01:04:19,518 --> 01:04:21,630
Are you okay? What happened down there?

750
01:04:22,463 --> 01:04:26,174
I, uh, I don't really like Mummy's cooking.

751
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:29,822
Well, can you keep a secret?

752
01:04:30,174 --> 01:04:32,766
I'm not crazy about it either.

753
01:04:32,862 --> 01:04:35,487
Well, listen, um, nighttime's my favorite time to paint.

754
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:36,511
You-- you want to come join me?

755
01:04:36,958 --> 01:04:39,838
Yes, I would love to. I'll see you downstairs.

756
01:05:13,566 --> 01:05:16,510
This is a such a great space. I'm glad you like it.

757
01:05:17,086 --> 01:05:21,022
Every artist needs a space to let their inner weirdo out.

758
01:05:21,886 --> 01:05:23,869
We get to see beauty and passion

759
01:05:24,478 --> 01:05:26,238
where others don't even know to look.

760
01:05:30,078 --> 01:05:31,357
I really like that.

761
01:05:43,615 --> 01:05:44,862
So much paint.

762
01:05:44,926 --> 01:05:46,558
Yeah, I'm a messy painter.

763
01:05:46,877 --> 01:05:48,254
Drives your mother crazy.

764
01:05:52,381 --> 01:05:54,493
I think I'm-- I think I'm done for the night.

765
01:05:55,135 --> 01:05:56,349
Just turn the lights off.

766
01:05:57,277 --> 01:05:58,590
Have a good night.

767
01:06:16,637 --> 01:06:18,046
Looks like you two had fun.

768
01:06:21,469 --> 01:06:25,021
He's right, you are talented.

769
01:06:27,997 --> 01:06:29,917
He is something, isn't he?

770
01:06:32,477 --> 01:06:36,125
Are you so utterly delusional to think that he would want you?

771
01:06:37,628 --> 01:06:39,294
"Surprise, I'm not your daughter,

772
01:06:39,357 --> 01:06:40,830
I'm a mutant grifter."

773
01:06:41,918 --> 01:06:45,565
He would be as repulsed by you as I suspect most men are.

774
01:06:46,718 --> 01:06:49,052
Well, if you'll excuse me,

775
01:06:49,469 --> 01:06:52,988
I'm gonna go upstairs and fuck my husband.

776
01:06:57,724 --> 01:07:00,254
He really is a new man since you came back.

777
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:01,949
Thanks for that.

778
01:07:36,957 --> 01:07:38,140
Hey, you.

779
01:08:15,741 --> 01:08:17,404
I think Esther's really bummed about not coming

780
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,812
to the gallery with me.

781
01:08:19,452 --> 01:08:21,211
Listen, I love that you and Esther

782
01:08:21,307 --> 01:08:23,005
have painting in common. I just--

783
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:24,860
I don't have anything like that with her.

784
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:26,780
I was hoping that I could spend the day with her

785
01:08:26,845 --> 01:08:28,381
and maybe we could find something to share.

786
01:08:28,573 --> 01:08:31,133
Plus, it would be good for you to be focused, right?

787
01:08:31,197 --> 01:08:33,148
I mean, if Sal likes what he sees,

788
01:08:33,213 --> 01:08:36,509
then maybe you get a show and get back out there.

789
01:08:36,635 --> 01:08:39,260
Yeah, okay. We're not hurting, are we?

790
01:08:39,451 --> 01:08:40,860
No, no. Not at all.

791
01:08:42,013 --> 01:08:43,741
You are a great painter.

792
01:08:44,476 --> 01:08:46,332
People miss seeing your work.

793
01:08:47,964 --> 01:08:48,988
Thank you.

794
01:08:51,548 --> 01:08:52,636
Is that bacon?

795
01:08:55,516 --> 01:08:56,827
It's heaven.

796
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:02,333
Good morning, Daddy. Crepe?

797
01:09:02,748 --> 01:09:05,244
Yes, please. Is there anything you can't do?

798
01:09:05,500 --> 01:09:06,524
Mummy?

799
01:09:06,748 --> 01:09:08,892
Oh, no, thanks. I'm gonna make my usual--

800
01:09:08,956 --> 01:09:09,916
Smoothie?

801
01:09:12,443 --> 01:09:16,540
Greek yogurt, kale, flax seeds, and lemon juice.

802
01:09:16,923 --> 01:09:18,332
Just the way you like it.

803
01:09:19,324 --> 01:09:20,316
Try it.

804
01:09:20,572 --> 01:09:23,452
I'm not really that hungry.

805
01:09:23,740 --> 01:09:25,308
I'll-- I'll have it. Here.

806
01:09:25,372 --> 01:09:27,292
No, this is special just for mummy.

807
01:09:27,546 --> 01:09:28,540
I made it for you.

808
01:09:28,763 --> 01:09:31,100
Oh, sweetie, that's so nice of you,

809
01:09:31,547 --> 01:09:32,923
but I prefer to make my own.

810
01:09:33,020 --> 01:09:35,292
Tricia, come on. Try it.

811
01:09:42,171 --> 01:09:43,163
Good.

812
01:09:43,419 --> 01:09:45,339
Mm, delicious.

813
01:09:46,107 --> 01:09:47,067
Thank you.

814
01:09:51,803 --> 01:09:53,531
Tricia, you okay? I'm good.

815
01:09:53,596 --> 01:09:54,556
Yeah?

816
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:09,819
I know you wanted to come with me,

817
01:10:09,947 --> 01:10:11,835
but I think it'll be really good for you to spend the day

818
01:10:11,899 --> 01:10:13,979
with your mom. I wanted to show you something, though.

819
01:10:14,203 --> 01:10:15,195
Here.

820
01:10:18,362 --> 01:10:20,347
It's the one in the center.

821
01:10:23,291 --> 01:10:24,859
Dean at Woodley is a friend of mine.

822
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:27,002
Woodley is the best art school in the country.

823
01:10:27,259 --> 01:10:29,019
You're scary good, Esther. Can I show it to 'em?

824
01:10:29,723 --> 01:10:31,387
I would love it. Thank you.

825
01:10:34,523 --> 01:10:35,995
Can you bring this up to the platform?

826
01:10:36,059 --> 01:10:38,747
I'm just gonna get some coffees for Mom and Dad.

827
01:10:38,842 --> 01:10:39,739
Mm-hmm.

828
01:10:39,867 --> 01:10:41,563
All right, I'll see you up there.

829
01:11:43,386 --> 01:11:45,626
Jesus Christ! Watch where you're going, kid!

830
01:11:45,689 --> 01:11:47,482
Does she belong to you? Yes, she does.

831
01:11:48,122 --> 01:11:49,915
What happened? Oh, nothing. It's fine.

832
01:11:49,979 --> 01:11:51,834
Esther tripped. Sorry, it took forever.

833
01:11:51,995 --> 01:11:54,330
No, no! Knock 'em dead, okay? Yeah.

834
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,730
Daddy, take me with you!

835
01:11:56,794 --> 01:11:58,394
Oh, honey, I wish. Next time.

836
01:11:58,490 --> 01:12:00,186
You're gonna miss your train. All right, see you later, honey.

837
01:12:00,378 --> 01:12:01,338
Ciao.

838
01:12:08,154 --> 01:12:08,922
Easy, Mom.

839
01:12:08,985 --> 01:12:11,034
You think you can fucking kill me?

840
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,018
Take this.

841
01:12:14,233 --> 01:12:15,642
Tastes like fucking garbage.

842
01:12:16,057 --> 01:12:19,417
Our arrangement is over. You're fucking dead.

843
01:12:21,017 --> 01:12:21,977
Hey!

844
01:12:32,410 --> 01:12:34,297
Mom! Mom!

845
01:12:34,649 --> 01:12:37,657
Fuck! Bitch!

846
01:12:47,033 --> 01:12:49,529
Open the God damn door. Esther!

847
01:12:50,745 --> 01:12:52,250
Sweetie, come on.

848
01:12:52,826 --> 01:12:55,258

You must be Esther.

862
01:14:16,856 --> 01:14:19,256
I need to go to the hospital.

863
01:14:19,481 --> 01:14:20,600
You're fine.

864
01:14:20,729 --> 01:14:23,161
Feels like I'm being stabbed a 1,000 fucking times.

865
01:14:23,256 --> 01:14:25,464
Officer Leahy. Oh, my God.

866
01:14:25,528 --> 01:14:27,608
Can you just be quiet for, like, two seconds?

867
01:14:27,736 --> 01:14:29,240
What? We've located Esther.

868
01:14:29,368 --> 01:14:31,128
You did? I'm bringing her home.

869
01:14:31,192 --> 01:14:31,960
Oh.

870
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:33,561
Oh, and I've informed Allen as well.

871
01:14:33,625 --> 01:14:35,896
Okay, bye. Fuck!

872
01:14:36,152 --> 01:14:38,552
You're okay. You're okay.

873
01:14:39,321 --> 01:14:40,696
Thank you so much.

874
01:14:43,737 --> 01:14:45,624
Oh, my goodness. Oh.

875
01:14:49,945 --> 01:14:52,279
Thank you so much.

876
01:14:53,303 --> 01:14:57,304
Esther's behavior has been so erratic since she got back.

877
01:14:57,848 --> 01:15:00,311
To be honest, it's been really hard.

878
01:15:00,856 --> 01:15:04,503
I mean, there's constant lying and these outbursts of anger.

879
01:15:04,919 --> 01:15:07,064
Sometimes she even jokes about hurting herself

880
01:15:07,129 --> 01:15:08,696
and I don't think she's really joking.

881
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:11,831
You have her in therapy? Yes, yes.

882
01:15:15,191 --> 01:15:16,535
Look who's back.

883
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:29,975
Get up. We're doing this. Now.

884
01:15:30,136 --> 01:15:32,247
Well, it's about goddamn time.

885
01:15:58,968 --> 01:16:00,151
Fuck.

886
01:16:01,111 --> 01:16:02,456
I am done with you.

887
01:16:03,095 --> 01:16:05,527
Nothing is worth having you in this house.

888
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:26,519
Your suicide is gonna break Daddy's heart,

889
01:16:27,095 --> 01:16:28,407
but he'll get over it.

890
01:16:31,704 --> 01:16:34,902
Ugh.

891
01:16:48,919 --> 01:16:51,095
Just die, you freak!

892
01:17:00,662 --> 01:17:01,878
Where is she?

893
01:17:02,742 --> 01:17:05,239
I-- I-- I didn't mean to.

894
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:06,775
Oh, that's just brilliant.

895
01:17:08,151 --> 01:17:09,462
It just happened.

896
01:17:16,854 --> 01:17:18,934
Tricia. Hi, honey.

897
01:17:18,999 --> 01:17:20,182
The police just called me.

898
01:17:20,278 --> 01:17:23,447
Oh, I know. I'm-- I'm sorry. It was my fault.

899
01:17:23,543 --> 01:17:25,110
Esther wandered off at the store,

900
01:17:25,207 --> 01:17:26,454
and I just-- I panicked,

901
01:17:26,678 --> 01:17:27,991
but I called Officer Leahy... Mom.

902
01:17:28,055 --> 01:17:29,015
...and they found her.

903
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,294
Oh, good. Mom.

904
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:32,055
Well, I'm on the train. What?

905
01:17:32,151 --> 01:17:33,590
She's-- Hold on.

906
01:17:34,550 --> 01:17:36,054
I'm-- I'm coming back home.

907
01:17:36,278 --> 01:17:38,710
I'll be...

908
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,494
Go downstairs and finish it.

909
01:17:42,134 --> 01:17:45,495
What? Go downstairs and finish it.

910
01:17:45,559 --> 01:17:46,741
Tricia, are you still there?

911
01:17:47,383 --> 01:17:48,854
Tricia, is everything okay?

912
01:17:50,103 --> 01:17:51,478
Tricia, I-- I'm coming home now.

913
01:17:51,574 --> 01:17:52,534
What? I'm coming home.

914
01:17:52,598 --> 01:17:54,039
What about your meeting with Sal?

915
01:17:54,134 --> 01:17:55,127
Forget about that.

916
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,854
No, sweetie. I swear. Everything is fine.

917
01:17:56,950 --> 01:17:59,253
Esther is here, all is well.

918
01:17:59,318 --> 01:18:01,109
Look, I'm almost at the station in town.

919
01:18:01,238 --> 01:18:04,118
Okay, well, can you please take a cab home?

920
01:18:04,181 --> 01:18:06,261
Because I really have my hands full here.

921
01:18:14,741 --> 01:18:16,854
Ow, fuck it.

922
01:18:25,591 --> 01:18:26,965
There you are.

923
01:18:55,093 --> 01:18:56,116
Esther.

924
01:19:00,182 --> 01:19:02,070
Come on out, Esther

925
01:19:02,934 --> 01:19:05,364
or whatever the fuck your name is.

926
01:19:10,581 --> 01:19:14,485
You know, it doesn't have to be like this.

927
01:19:16,437 --> 01:19:17,493
Really, Gunnar?

928
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,789
I'm sure we could figure something out.

929
01:19:25,462 --> 01:19:26,613
You really believe that?

930
01:19:26,740 --> 01:19:28,853
Honestly?

931
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,773
No.

932
01:19:31,284 --> 01:19:32,469
Me neither.

933
01:19:33,620 --> 01:19:34,613
Shit.

934
01:19:59,797 --> 01:20:00,789
Gunnar?

935
01:20:05,236 --> 01:20:06,196
No.

936
01:20:07,188 --> 01:20:08,148
No!

937
01:20:12,853 --> 01:20:15,989
What have you done? What have you done?

938
01:21:57,395 --> 01:21:59,731
You've taken everything.

939
01:22:00,724 --> 01:22:02,836
Allen will never be yours,

940
01:22:03,315 --> 01:22:07,379
but I can I promise you this, he will know who you are.

941
01:22:07,795 --> 01:22:11,251
The deformed freak who manipulated our grief,

942
01:22:11,763 --> 01:22:15,667
murdered my son, and tried to kill me.

943
01:22:17,171 --> 01:22:19,891
Until I did what had to be done.

944
01:23:19,986 --> 01:23:21,363
Call the fire department!

945
01:23:26,545 --> 01:23:27,698
Gunnar!

946
01:23:29,139 --> 01:23:30,546
Gunnar!

947
01:23:46,706 --> 01:23:47,987
Hold on, I'm coming!

948
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,361
Help! Daddy, Mommy tried to hurt me!

949
01:23:53,425 --> 01:23:56,562
Allen! Please help!

950
01:23:57,458 --> 01:23:58,803
Allen! Don't let go!

951
01:23:59,378 --> 01:24:00,723
I can't hold on much longer.

952
01:24:01,074 --> 01:24:02,129
I'm losing my grip!

953
01:24:02,674 --> 01:24:06,034
Daddy, help! Honey, hang on. Hang on!

954
01:24:07,347 --> 01:24:08,338
I'm coming.

955
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:10,609
She is not Esther! She is a grown woman!

956
01:24:10,673 --> 01:24:11,665
She's lying! What?

957
01:24:11,794 --> 01:24:12,721
She tricked us! Mummy's lying!

958
01:24:13,074 --> 01:24:15,026
Give me your hand! No, Daddy! Please help me!

959
01:24:18,866 --> 01:24:20,562
Tricia!

960
01:25:02,576 --> 01:25:06,577
What the fuck? I did this for you. For us.

961
01:25:06,897 --> 01:25:09,842
So we could be together. Allen, I love you.

962
01:25:10,450 --> 01:25:13,521
Who the fuck are you? You're a monster!

963
01:25:13,586 --> 01:25:15,984

Fire took everything from Esther.

981
01:27:22,735 --> 01:27:24,560
Her home, her family.

982
01:27:24,976 --> 01:27:27,184
The whole situation is so tragic.

983
01:27:27,472 --> 01:27:28,815
It's horrifying.

984
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:30,832
I know.

985
01:27:31,312 --> 01:27:33,041
As if Esther hasn't been through enough already.

986
01:27:33,968 --> 01:27:38,959
Abducted and now an orphan with no family to take her in?

987
01:27:40,368 --> 01:27:41,903
What will happen now?

988
01:27:43,215 --> 01:27:46,096
I've reached out to a reputable adoption agency.

989
01:27:47,343 --> 01:27:49,936
I'm confident we'll find a home

990
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:53,552
