1
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:46,332
He's the next fighter.

2
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,250
I'm Chernung.

3
00:01:02,457 --> 00:01:05,125
I'm leader of
the Garuda Wing Cliff outlaws.

4
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,792
My blood is not for your sword to drink.

5
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:24,457
The man in black in front of you

6
00:01:24,582 --> 00:01:26,042
is the one who killed your father.

7
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:29,542
I'm the one who killed your father!

8
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:14,625
Let me repay your father's life

9
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:16,667
with mine,

10
00:02:17,207 --> 00:02:18,750
my dear son.

11
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,582
Chernung!

12
00:03:18,292 --> 00:03:21,000
According to the law of this land,

13
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,417
all his rights have been revoked.

14
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:30,207
This rebel shall receive 13 punishments

15
00:03:30,957 --> 00:03:32,917
until he breathes no longer.

16
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,375
Start the punishment.

17
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,333
Crush every one of his bones.

18
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,958
Let him follow his vicious father to hell.

19
00:09:15,832 --> 00:09:18,875
Add one part sweet sedge
and three parts salt.

20
00:09:19,417 --> 00:09:21,457
Don't forget to
put in some chili peppers.

21
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:35,750
The angels will protect you.
You'll get well soon.

22
00:09:39,125 --> 00:09:43,542
Hey. Take a look at each patient.
Why do they have similar symptoms?

23
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:48,792
Hey. Don't you know? They were cursed.

24
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:52,292
I see. That's why Master Bua
made a pilgrimage to the mountain

25
00:09:52,457 --> 00:09:54,250
to find a way to break the curse.

26
00:09:55,292 --> 00:09:57,125
The curse. The curse.

27
00:09:57,417 --> 00:09:59,832
-Mhen, go away!
-Go! Mhen!

28
00:09:59,917 --> 00:10:02,625
-Go! Go away!
-What the hell?

29
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:06,000
I wasn't making any trouble, you guys.

30
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Tien.

31
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,167
Are you really leaving, Tien?

32
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:05,042
Who will play with me if you're gone?

33
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:14,667
I won't let you go, Tien!
I won't let you go!

34
00:15:20,125 --> 00:15:22,042
I curse you.

35
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:26,042
You will meet a calamitous, miserable end.

36
00:15:27,667 --> 00:15:33,417
I curse you.
You will meet a calamitous, miserable end.

37
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,082
I curse you.

38
00:15:38,832 --> 00:15:41,750
You will meet a calamitous, miserable end.

39
00:15:43,625 --> 00:15:45,750
Let this decree be uttered

40
00:15:46,667 --> 00:15:50,417
with these sacred words,
in front of all the gods

41
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:55,917
who bear witness to this holy ritual.

42
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
For those who are loyal to me,

43
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,125
may the gods protect them.

44
00:16:04,917 --> 00:16:08,207
But anyone who thinks of betraying me

45
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:11,207
and this land shall be cursed

46
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:14,417
to meet a calamitous, miserable end

47
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:18,375
and shall be tormented forever.

48
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:40,957
-What's wrong with you?
-Dad, what wrong?

49
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:45,207
-Dad! Dad!
-Help!

50
00:16:45,457 --> 00:16:46,792
I curse you.

51
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,542
You will meet a calamitous, miserable end.

52
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:55,042
I curse you!

53
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,000
Your fighting skill is terrific.

54
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,833
Great fighters like you
are difficult to find.

55
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:46,416
If you come to work for me at the palace,

56
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,333
I will grant you everything you wish for.

57
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:53,250
What royal grace
you've bestowed upon me.

58
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:55,708
But I...

59
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:58,916
desire nothing from you, Your Highness.

60
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,250
Take your reward.

61
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:17,708
And remember,
you are not in any position to negotiate.

62
00:20:19,708 --> 00:20:20,958
You're just a crow.

63
00:20:21,625 --> 00:20:24,875
How dare you negotiate
with a King Garuda like me?

64
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:29,458
Have you been having nightmares lately?

65
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,666
The curse in your nightmare

66
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,916
will haunt you for the rest of your life.

67
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:40,166
He is the one who brings the curse.

68
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,708
Only I can break that curse.

69
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:57,458
You must come to me. You must come to me!

70
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,125
Cut off this rebel's head tomorrow.

71
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:20,041
Executioner.

72
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:23,416
Kill him.

73
00:22:59,541 --> 00:23:01,041
Halt the execution!

74
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:12,916
Bow to the Royal Decree!

75
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:21,416
I have come to take this prisoner

76
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:25,750
by the command of the King of Ayothaya.

77
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,166
How could Ayothaya do this to me?

78
00:23:53,125 --> 00:23:57,416
I believe there must be a traitor...

79
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:02,958
who has been plotting
against Your Highness.

80
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,916
Rest assured, Your Highness.

81
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:10,791
I have sent the assassins

82
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,166
to take care of this matter.

83
00:24:45,166 --> 00:24:48,541
I curse you!

84
00:24:48,666 --> 00:24:50,500
-I curse you!
-I curse you!

85
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:53,583
I curse you!

86
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:55,374
-I curse you!
-I curse you!

87
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:57,583
-I curse you!
-I curse you!

88
00:24:57,666 --> 00:24:59,125
You will meet a calamitous end!

89
00:26:10,416 --> 00:26:12,500
Bring the injured in here quickly. Go!

90
00:26:16,666 --> 00:26:17,750
Please heal this man.

91
00:26:21,666 --> 00:26:22,666
This way.

92
00:26:26,083 --> 00:26:27,166
Give me a hand.

93
00:26:29,541 --> 00:26:31,875
Quick! Bring me some medicine,
water and clean clothes.

94
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,208
Come and help him. Quick!

95
00:26:52,125 --> 00:26:55,833
This is for my father, Lord Siha Decho!

96
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:16,000
Take the rebel's head!

97
00:28:19,708 --> 00:28:20,791
My Lord.

98
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,750
Do we still have any hope?

99
00:29:45,625 --> 00:29:47,208
Tien was born under an ominous sign.

100
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:49,875
It is his old karma

101
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,125
that causes him to suffer in this life.

102
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,083
The corporeal body is still waiting for
the mind to be free of wrath.

103
00:29:59,416 --> 00:30:01,000
Wandering around,

104
00:30:02,291 --> 00:30:03,750
fending off the revenge of karma.

105
00:30:12,375 --> 00:30:13,666
I'll have to try

106
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:16,166
to alleviate his tortured fate.

107
00:30:25,041 --> 00:30:28,500
If you all
could unite the power of your minds,

108
00:30:31,833 --> 00:30:33,541
your strength of faith,

109
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,625
to prolong his life,

110
00:30:39,208 --> 00:30:41,791
the merit created

111
00:30:42,375 --> 00:30:44,291
might please the enemies of his past life.

112
00:30:45,291 --> 00:30:47,916
Then his mind can be released

113
00:30:48,875 --> 00:30:50,875
from torment and return to his body.

114
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:57,583
Here. I give you everything.

115
00:34:32,375 --> 00:34:36,833
Oh, he's alive. He's waking up.

116
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:40,000
He's waking up. He's alive.

117
00:34:55,208 --> 00:34:58,541
Anyone who thinks of betraying me

118
00:35:02,458 --> 00:35:05,875
shall be cursed to meet
a calamitous, miserable end

119
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:09,541
and shall be tormented forever.

120
00:35:17,375 --> 00:35:18,541
Don't worry, Tien.

121
00:35:19,916 --> 00:35:20,916
You're much better now.

122
00:35:22,708 --> 00:35:23,750
It won't be long.

123
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,125
It won't be long
before we can dance together, Tien.

124
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:09,083
Get out!

125
00:37:11,666 --> 00:37:12,666
Get out!

126
00:40:29,875 --> 00:40:34,541
-Are you crying?
-Go away! Leave me alone! Go!

127
00:40:38,958 --> 00:40:40,083
Crying...

128
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:43,208
Leave me alone.

129
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,291
Oh, it's high.

130
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,916
Okay. I'll go with you.
We can walk together.

131
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:07,791
Quickly.

132
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:10,375
Quickly. Let's go.

133
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:12,875
Come on. We can walk together.

134
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:23,875
Oh, wow. It's high. It's high, huh?

135
00:41:24,666 --> 00:41:25,750
I said go away.

136
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:28,458
I said go away!

137
00:41:31,125 --> 00:41:32,541
No. I've changed my mind.

138
00:41:34,416 --> 00:41:36,625
Back off.

139
00:41:38,083 --> 00:41:41,125
Go away!

140
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,208
Don't cry.

141
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:46,166
Laugh. We should laugh.

142
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:50,791
Go!

143
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:02,125
Go ahead and jump.
He's not going to follow you.

144
00:42:06,166 --> 00:42:07,333
He hasn't got any hair.

145
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:10,833
Because an insane person like Mhen

146
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,625
can understand the world better
than a sane person like you.

147
00:42:16,375 --> 00:42:18,791
Staying up there is better than jumping.

148
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:28,041
My life is hopeless.

149
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:32,625
I'm alive, yet my life is worthless.

150
00:42:35,291 --> 00:42:39,708
You were born with an ominous fate
that causes your suffering.

151
00:42:48,791 --> 00:42:52,625
But now, my name
can not help to rectify my fate.

152
00:43:01,083 --> 00:43:03,458
I can't accept having to live like this.

153
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,958
Your name only symbolizes
its meaning, "light".

154
00:43:11,916 --> 00:43:12,958
Tien.

155
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:17,666
Take a look in front of you now.

156
00:43:31,583 --> 00:43:33,625
The light is driving away the darkness.

157
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:37,666
Look at the ground.

158
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:43,291
Now you can see your own shadow.

159
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,708
If you have been scared by
the shadow that has been following you,

160
00:43:51,333 --> 00:43:52,750
just remember,

161
00:43:54,291 --> 00:43:55,333
wherever the shadow is,

162
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,791
the light is always nearby.

163
00:44:14,333 --> 00:44:15,416
Father,

164
00:44:17,708 --> 00:44:19,291
what should I do now?

165
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,583
Follow me.

166
00:44:23,750 --> 00:44:25,250
Seek solitude. Practice meditation.

167
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,458
Enlighten your mind.

168
00:45:08,458 --> 00:45:10,958
Tien, do you want to train
your weapon skills?

169
00:45:15,291 --> 00:45:17,166
I want to be a great warrior
like my father.

170
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:20,791
Your father is a great warrior.

171
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:23,500
But that didn't help him
to find peace in his life.

172
00:45:36,375 --> 00:45:39,208
A weapon is a tangible form of power.

173
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:48,166
Anyone who can merge
his body and soul with it...

174
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:51,875
will possess the greatest power.

175
00:45:54,625 --> 00:45:56,500
Do you think a person
who learns about weapons

176
00:45:57,208 --> 00:45:59,750
can bring peace to the land?

177
00:46:00,916 --> 00:46:02,306
Chernung!

178
00:46:02,456 --> 00:46:03,833
Leave me alone!

179
00:46:07,791 --> 00:46:10,500
My life is in the dark. It's hopeless.

180
00:46:13,333 --> 00:46:16,500
Tien, your name means "candle".
It's a symbol of light in Buddhism.

181
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,791
Light means the wisdom

182
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:24,750
that eradicates the darkness of ignorance.

183
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:26,666
The benightedness of the mind.

184
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:34,541
Wisdom can bring
enduring peace to this world.

185
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,333
I brought someone to see you.

186
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:10,000
She's pretty. Do you want her?

187
00:50:54,750 --> 00:50:56,250
I can dance alone.

188
00:52:16,583 --> 00:52:18,041
What are they doing?

189
00:52:19,916 --> 00:52:21,125
I know.

190
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:34,458
Now I understand
what your intention was,

191
00:52:35,833 --> 00:52:38,125
why you taught me the art of dancing.

192
00:52:39,875 --> 00:52:41,750
It is to cure the body and mind.

193
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,375
I'm thankful to you for changing my life.

194
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,958
It's your mind that accepted the change.

195
00:52:56,833 --> 00:52:59,666
Change the enemies into dancing partners.

196
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:05,000
There are many things in this world
that you have yet to learn.

197
00:53:06,166 --> 00:53:10,416
Greed. Wrath. Infatuation.
Desire. Lust. And ignorance.

198
00:53:12,333 --> 00:53:13,416
Always be careful.

199
00:53:14,375 --> 00:53:15,500
Because these things

200
00:53:16,166 --> 00:53:18,583
are the causes of karma.

201
00:53:19,041 --> 00:53:21,458
They cause all living creatures
to be stuck

202
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:23,375
in the perpetual cycle of birth and death.

203
00:53:26,375 --> 00:53:28,041
How can I stop these things?

204
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:32,541
Through practice.

205
00:53:33,625 --> 00:53:35,541
Practice cleansing and purifying

206
00:53:36,666 --> 00:53:38,583
deep into your mind.

207
00:53:41,166 --> 00:53:43,833
The mind is the master,
the body is the servant.

208
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:50,250
The consciousness controls your mind.

209
00:53:51,291 --> 00:53:54,958
The mind comprehends. Be aware,

210
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:58,916
then let go.
Your mind will remain untarnished.

211
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:28,750
My castle welcomes only you,
Your Highness.

212
00:57:30,541 --> 00:57:31,833
You all wait for me here.

213
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:38,041
Thank you for visiting me, Your Highness.

214
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:06,458
-What do you really want?
-Power...

215
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:09,666
and everything you own.

216
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:16,583
I curse you!

217
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:08,000
The power... is mine.

218
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:20,541
Kill him! Kill him!

219
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:38,250
All of you, go inside and kill him.
Kill him!

220
01:02:54,875 --> 01:02:59,041
Power should be possessed
by those who deserve it.

221
01:03:02,166 --> 01:03:04,375
You rebellious crow. Traitor!

222
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:28,666
I curse you.

223
01:03:29,333 --> 01:03:32,458
You will meet a calamitous, miserable end.

224
01:03:32,833 --> 01:03:35,291
A calamitous, miserable end.

225
01:03:36,333 --> 01:03:38,791
A calamitous, miserable end.

226
01:03:44,250 --> 01:03:46,416
A calamitous, miserable end.

227
01:03:47,416 --> 01:03:49,083
A calamitous, miserable end.

228
01:04:50,541 --> 01:04:52,166
Submit yourselves to me!

229
01:04:54,583 --> 01:04:56,416
I am your king now.

230
01:06:25,625 --> 01:06:27,375
I brought someone to see you.

231
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:32,125
Come on!

232
01:06:33,541 --> 01:06:34,541
Here he is.

233
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:39,083
Why are you hiding? Over there.

234
01:06:42,375 --> 01:06:46,750
-Capture him!
-Why? What did I do wrong?

235
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,333
Oh, many people.

236
01:07:22,500 --> 01:07:24,458
I stamped on your foot.

237
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,000
I'm taking it off.

238
01:07:45,083 --> 01:07:48,291
Your nose is bleeding. Your mouth too.

239
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:52,875
Don't draw your sword.

240
01:08:05,958 --> 01:08:10,333
There is a rope. I'll pull it.

241
01:08:18,750 --> 01:08:19,667
Got it.

242
01:08:25,832 --> 01:08:27,832
Must have broken his balls.

243
01:08:30,125 --> 01:08:31,625
Oh, the same rope.

244
01:08:39,457 --> 01:08:40,375
Where are you going?

245
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:49,707
You are the chosen one

246
01:12:50,792 --> 01:12:53,167
to fight and drive away ignorance.

247
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,332
Stop your evil acts.

248
01:15:40,875 --> 01:15:42,625
Finally, you have come.

249
01:15:49,457 --> 01:15:50,917
I'm here to stop you.

250
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:55,082
You? Stop me?

251
01:16:03,167 --> 01:16:04,957
There is no way you can stop me.

252
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:08,500
Look.

253
01:16:09,707 --> 01:16:12,250
None of your mighty gods

254
01:16:13,457 --> 01:16:17,332
can withstand my power.

255
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,417
I can smell

256
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:41,500
the bitterness and vengefulness in you.

257
01:16:44,917 --> 01:16:48,123
Move! Go! Move!

258
01:16:48,207 --> 01:16:51,082
Let me go! Let me go!

259
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:54,082
Tien!

260
01:16:55,542 --> 01:16:57,832
Let me go! Tien!

261
01:17:08,667 --> 01:17:10,207
Your fate

262
01:17:11,667 --> 01:17:13,625
belongs to me.

263
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:27,625
Tien.

264
01:17:29,332 --> 01:17:32,457
Your life is coming to an end.

265
01:17:34,542 --> 01:17:36,332
You don't have a choice.

266
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:51,792
No!

267
01:22:51,207 --> 01:22:54,957
The bitterness
and vengefulness in your heart

268
01:22:56,082 --> 01:23:01,042
give me power.
You can never overcome me.

269
01:23:10,875 --> 01:23:16,000
I have come from emptiness.
I shall return to emptiness.

270
01:23:27,082 --> 01:23:29,292
You don't have a choice.

271
01:38:26,979 --> 01:38:28,979
