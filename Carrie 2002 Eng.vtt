00:06.000 --> 00:12.074
You're watching from StreamFlex app.

00:48.240 --> 00:49.720
Would you like some water
or anything?

00:49.867 --> 00:51.786
- Coffee?
- No.

00:52.536 --> 00:54.246
Remember,
your mom's right outside...

00:54.455 --> 00:56.332
if you want to stop or anything.

00:57.416 --> 00:59.001
- Hi, Madeline.
- Sergeant.

01:00.044 --> 01:01.212
OK.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.965
Don't be nervous, OK?

01:04.507 --> 01:05.675
I'm not nervous.

01:06.008 --> 01:07.301
You want a donut?

01:09.178 --> 01:11.973
Pastry cream.
Hot right now.

01:13.557 --> 01:15.142
Come on.

01:17.353 --> 01:21.107
You know,
these traditional glazed...

01:21.273 --> 01:25.987
Are like heroin...
Highly addictive.

01:29.156 --> 01:31.283
- You ever try heroin, Sue?
- No.

01:32.410 --> 01:34.870
Good girl.
It's nasty stuff.

01:35.871 --> 01:37.999
- Cocaine?
- No.

01:38.165 --> 01:40.250
Hit a little "X"?
Occasional joint?

01:40.459 --> 01:43.004
- No.
- Good for you.

01:44.088 --> 01:45.297
We're all set.

01:45.840 --> 01:48.300
We're all set. All right.
Thank you, Madeline.

01:50.928 --> 01:52.763
State your name
for the record, please.

01:54.306 --> 01:55.433
Sue Snell.

01:56.267 --> 01:57.727
I want to talk
about Carrie White.

01:58.227 --> 01:59.937
What do you want to know?

02:11.824 --> 02:13.909
It's Jeremy, right?

02:14.118 --> 02:16.495
- Norma.
- Yes, Mr. Schernhorst?

02:16.787 --> 02:19.290
Norma, what were you
doing last night?

02:19.457 --> 02:21.292
Could I possibly borrow
your Elvis pen?

02:21.500 --> 02:22.585
You know, just...

02:22.752 --> 02:25.171
Hey.
Did you do the homework?

02:25.337 --> 02:27.339
You guys are really annoying.

02:30.968 --> 02:32.845
Just sit down, OK?

02:36.140 --> 02:37.475
Stop it.

02:38.142 --> 02:39.727
You know
what I'm talking about?

02:41.979 --> 02:44.607
Get out of here.
Yeah, I mean you.

02:44.815 --> 02:46.567
All right,
butts in the seats.

02:52.656 --> 02:54.283
- Carrie White.
- Here.

02:54.992 --> 02:56.535
It's not roll call, Carrie.

02:56.702 --> 02:59.121
You're excused
per your mother's request.

02:59.330 --> 03:01.415
You might as well head down
to the library right now.

03:01.999 --> 03:03.834
Shouldn't people like that
be home-schooled?

03:04.335 --> 03:05.586
People like what, Chris?

03:06.003 --> 03:08.130
You know.
Creepy religious people.

03:09.090 --> 03:10.966
Give it a rest.

03:11.175 --> 03:13.177
- Mr. Schernhorst.
- What?

03:13.844 --> 03:16.055
I'm a creepy religious person.
Can I be excused?

03:16.222 --> 03:17.306
Shut up, Kenny.

03:17.473 --> 03:20.101
- Shut up, Kenny.
- Yes, Kenny, shut up.

03:20.267 --> 03:21.352
All right.

03:23.479 --> 03:24.814
Was she a friend of yours?

03:27.900 --> 03:29.610
Carrie didn't have any friends.

03:29.819 --> 03:31.153
When I was in high school...

03:31.320 --> 03:34.281
even the biggest losers
had birds of a feather.

03:34.490 --> 03:37.034
She wasn't a loser.
She just didn't belong.

03:37.368 --> 03:38.452
Why do you think that is?

03:38.619 --> 03:40.996
It's not brain surgery.

03:41.163 --> 03:43.249
We are talking
about Carrie White.

03:43.415 --> 03:44.959
Maybe she didn't want to belong.

03:45.126 --> 03:47.211
Everybody wants to belong.

03:47.419 --> 03:49.380
Anyone who tells you
they don't is lying.

03:50.256 --> 03:52.508
I think Carrie wanted it
more than any of us.

03:56.846 --> 03:58.722
Check it out.

04:08.315 --> 04:09.817
Are you telling me
it's mine or what?

04:09.984 --> 04:11.318
Whatever. Let's go.

04:13.237 --> 04:15.531
Seriously,
she's been eyeing him...

04:15.739 --> 04:17.533
I don't know,
praying for him.

04:24.832 --> 04:26.917
Hey, hey,
come here, come here.

04:28.878 --> 04:30.171
See? Look over there.

04:40.222 --> 04:41.390
Hey, Ross.

04:42.141 --> 04:43.267
Ross.

04:44.768 --> 04:49.732
I think somebody wants you
to help her to see God.

04:49.899 --> 04:52.860
You know, God?
Oh, yeah.

04:53.068 --> 04:54.987
Oh, yeah, God.

04:55.571 --> 04:56.864
Oh, God.

04:57.072 --> 05:00.242
Oh, God. Oh, yeah.
Oh, God.

05:06.290 --> 05:09.668
You ass!
Is my nose bleeding, dude?

05:10.961 --> 05:13.589
No, seriously, come on.
Do I got a...

05:25.851 --> 05:27.353
Bases loaded.

05:28.979 --> 05:30.314
OK, come on, Carrie.

05:34.610 --> 05:36.153
Come on, girls!

05:41.909 --> 05:42.952
Strike two.

05:43.160 --> 05:44.620
Okay, Carrie, come on.
You can do it.

05:44.828 --> 05:46.580
Just keep your eyes
on the ball.

05:48.999 --> 05:50.626
You think she's retarded?

05:53.128 --> 05:56.382
Miss, miss, miss, miss!

05:56.590 --> 05:57.883
Tina, knock it off.

05:59.843 --> 06:01.387
OK, come on, Carrie.

06:08.477 --> 06:10.145
Strike three.
Okay, that's it, girls.

06:10.312 --> 06:11.981
Game's over.
Hit the showers.

06:14.650 --> 06:16.068
Let's go, let's go!

06:16.735 --> 06:17.987
Thanks.

06:19.029 --> 06:21.490
No chance with her on our team.
No chance at all.

06:21.699 --> 06:23.325
Carrie, you're such a loser.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.746
"Oh, I can't hit the ball."

06:28.539 --> 06:29.915
Hit the ball, stupid.

06:31.375 --> 06:32.835
You suck.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.103
Yeah.
Really?

08:42.965 --> 08:46.218
Dude, Carrie's
Aunt Flo's in town.

08:46.427 --> 08:48.262
- She's freaking out!
- Are you serious?

08:48.429 --> 08:49.888
- Yes. Come on.
- Oh, my God.

08:57.688 --> 08:59.690
Did you get your period?

09:01.191 --> 09:06.697
Period! Period! Period!

09:35.225 --> 09:36.810
Knock it off!

09:37.561 --> 09:38.854
What are you doing?

09:39.021 --> 09:40.230
She just got her period,
that's all.

09:40.439 --> 09:43.275
Get out, everybody!
Get out! Get out!

09:44.109 --> 09:45.235
Carrie?

09:46.570 --> 09:48.864
Carrie, come on.

09:49.031 --> 09:51.283
I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!

09:52.659 --> 09:53.869
Come on, come on.

09:54.077 --> 09:56.288
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

09:57.039 --> 09:58.832
Carrie.
All right, Carrie.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.835
Carrie! Carrie?

10:13.722 --> 10:14.973
It's OK.

10:15.390 --> 10:17.184
Am I dying?

10:18.977 --> 10:20.521
No.

10:34.993 --> 10:36.453
Isn't she a little...

10:36.620 --> 10:38.914
What, old?
For her first?

10:39.122 --> 10:41.708
Yeah. Most girls
have theirs at twelve.

10:42.084 --> 10:43.794
I got mine when I was ten.

10:44.461 --> 10:45.462
Ten?

10:45.671 --> 10:47.256
I was wearing these white pants.

10:47.464 --> 10:51.885
Oh, my God,
I was mortified. I...

10:55.722 --> 10:58.141
The point is,
up until half an hour ago...

10:58.308 --> 11:01.019
Carrie White thought
her first period was homeroom.

11:01.186 --> 11:03.814
That's good-homeroom.

11:03.981 --> 11:05.566
It's not a joke.

11:05.732 --> 11:07.985
She thought
she was bleeding to death.

11:09.528 --> 11:10.696
I just...

11:11.613 --> 11:14.074
I find it hard to believe
that in this day and age

11:14.241 --> 11:17.202
a girl wouldn't know...
something.

11:17.369 --> 11:18.829
Look at who her mother is.

11:18.996 --> 11:21.540
It's not our place to interfere
in people's beliefs.

11:21.707 --> 11:23.458
What about the other girls?

11:23.667 --> 11:25.028
What are we going to do
about them?

11:25.794 --> 11:28.130
Well, they'll have to
be disciplined.

11:29.548 --> 11:32.426
In the meantime, I think...
What's her name?

11:32.968 --> 11:33.927
Carrie?

11:34.136 --> 11:36.471
Carrie should be sent home
for the rest of the day.

11:38.056 --> 11:39.683
Send in Carrie Wright.

11:39.850 --> 11:41.184
It's Carrie White.

11:41.685 --> 11:43.312
Come in, Cassie.

11:47.107 --> 11:48.947
Miss Fish, can we get
a dismissal slip, please?

11:55.574 --> 11:57.367
We feel it would be best...

11:57.534 --> 11:59.453
if you went home
for the rest of the day...

11:59.620 --> 12:01.997
and took care of yourself.

12:03.915 --> 12:05.709
We're very sorry
about all this, Cassie.

12:05.876 --> 12:09.588
- It's Carrie.
- Do you need a ride?

12:09.755 --> 12:11.590
We can call a cab
if you need one.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.967
No, she can walk.
The fresh air will do her good.

12:15.010 --> 12:18.680
Carrie, I'm going to excuse you
from gym for a week.

12:18.889 --> 12:21.058
I think you should take
study hall instead, okay?

12:21.391 --> 12:22.768
As I said...

12:23.393 --> 12:24.953
We're very sorry
about all this, Cassie.

12:25.020 --> 12:26.313
It's Carrie!

12:37.074 --> 12:38.825
- Gross.
- Yeah.

14:27.559 --> 14:29.102
Plug it up, baby.

14:34.024 --> 14:35.609
What are those, Carrie?

14:40.447 --> 14:41.615
Thank you.

15:10.811 --> 15:12.771
God, I hate her.

15:55.939 --> 15:57.691
Creepy Carrie!
Creepy Carrie!

17:31.451 --> 17:32.577
HI:

17:35.205 --> 17:37.040
What are those?

17:38.792 --> 17:39.918
Breasts.

17:41.211 --> 17:42.879
I wish I had some.

17:43.046 --> 17:45.090
You have to wait a few years,
but you'll get them...

17:45.256 --> 17:46.925
and I bet
they'll be real pretty, too.

17:47.092 --> 17:51.221
No, I won't.
Mama says good girls don't.

17:51.388 --> 17:53.640
She said what?

17:53.848 --> 17:55.558
Good girls don't get...

17:55.767 --> 17:57.936
Your mother's a total hypocrite.
She's like a "C" cup.

17:58.561 --> 18:01.982
Mama says she was bad
when she made me.

18:02.190 --> 18:03.942
That's why she has 'em.

18:04.401 --> 18:07.028
Calls 'em dirty pillows.

18:07.195 --> 18:08.863
Dirty pillows.

18:09.572 --> 18:11.658
Afternoon, Margaret.

18:13.284 --> 18:16.287
Carrie, get over here.
What did I tell you?

18:16.496 --> 18:19.124
Calm down, Margaret.
We were just talking.

18:19.290 --> 18:21.084
Don't tell me to calm down,
whore girl.

18:21.251 --> 18:24.337
Now, Margaret, I asked you
not to call my daughter that.

18:24.546 --> 18:26.798
- Suck it, you cow.
- Estelle!

18:27.549 --> 18:30.802
Carrie, get in this house...

18:31.428 --> 18:32.971
right now.

18:34.139 --> 18:36.141
Do yourself a favor
and run away from home.

18:36.307 --> 18:37.684
Estelle, quiet.

18:37.892 --> 18:40.270
Margaret says I got boobs
because I was a slut.

18:40.437 --> 18:41.688
She said what?

18:41.896 --> 18:44.399
- Mama!
- The Lord is not mocked!

18:44.774 --> 18:47.569
Protect us from
He with the Split Foot...

18:47.777 --> 18:48.862
who waits...

18:50.697 --> 18:52.449
Protect us from
rebellious daughters...

18:52.949 --> 18:55.368
- Not in the closet!
- You disobeyed me!

19:10.175 --> 19:12.594
Mama, no!

19:14.971 --> 19:18.683
Mama! Unlock the door!

19:27.484 --> 19:28.485
Stop it!

19:33.740 --> 19:35.116
Stop it!

19:38.620 --> 19:40.246
Go to your closet and pray.

19:40.413 --> 19:43.666
I don't want
to go to the closet!

20:25.625 --> 20:27.127
You're a woman now.

20:53.319 --> 20:56.531
Why didn't you tell me, Mama?
I was so scared.

20:59.409 --> 21:01.077
I prayed.

21:01.244 --> 21:04.581
I prayed the curse would
never happen to you.

21:04.747 --> 21:06.666
It's not a curse, Mama.

21:07.542 --> 21:08.918
Come.

21:26.102 --> 21:29.272
And God made Eve
from the rib of Adam.

21:29.439 --> 21:33.318
And Eve was weak and loosed
the raven on the world...

21:33.484 --> 21:34.903
and the raven was called Sin...

21:35.111 --> 21:37.113
and the first sin
was intercourse.

21:37.280 --> 21:39.407
And the Lord visited Eve
with a curse...

21:39.574 --> 21:42.327
and the curse
was the curse of blood.

21:42.535 --> 21:44.871
Eve was weak.
Say it.

21:48.499 --> 21:50.919
No, Mama.
It wasn't my fault.

21:51.085 --> 21:52.337
Say it.

21:52.503 --> 21:54.631
I didn't do anything wrong.

22:02.597 --> 22:05.725
Eve was weak.
Say it.

22:06.893 --> 22:08.478
Eve was weak.

22:11.481 --> 22:14.817
You should've told me, Mama.
The girls all made fun of me.

22:14.984 --> 22:16.527
Ask for forgiveness of your sin.

22:16.694 --> 22:18.238
I didn't sin.
You sinned.

22:18.404 --> 22:19.845
You didn't tell me,
and they laughed.

22:22.283 --> 22:24.702
Don't you know
I can see inside you?

22:27.497 --> 22:30.250
I can see your sin
as surely as God can.

22:35.004 --> 22:36.631
Go to your closet and pray.

22:36.839 --> 22:38.341
No, Mama.

22:40.510 --> 22:42.762
- You pray to God...
- Mama, let me go!

22:42.929 --> 22:44.973
...and your sins
will be washed away.

22:47.433 --> 22:48.685
Pray.

22:51.688 --> 22:53.898
Mama, please!

22:55.733 --> 22:57.235
Pray.

23:00.863 --> 23:04.742
Mama, please!
Mama!

23:44.073 --> 23:45.992
"Jesus watches
from the wall..."

23:46.159 --> 23:48.661
"but his face
is cold as stone."

23:49.495 --> 23:52.081
"And if He loves me
as she tells me..."

23:52.290 --> 23:54.208
"why do I feel so all alone?"

23:56.669 --> 23:58.921
Any speculation
as to who the author is?

23:59.130 --> 24:02.050
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say Carrie White.

24:03.301 --> 24:05.011
What do you suppose
she's trying to say?

24:07.096 --> 24:10.099
Probably,
"Help me. My mother's insane."

24:10.266 --> 24:11.517
Interesting.

24:11.684 --> 24:15.480
Do you consider yourself
anti-religious, Sue?

24:15.646 --> 24:18.566
No. I just think some people
take it too far that's all.

24:18.733 --> 24:20.401
And you disapprove?

24:20.568 --> 24:21.649
Look, I'm all for believing

24:21.819 --> 24:23.460
whatever it is that
you want to believe...

24:23.613 --> 24:25.073
but you say religion to me...

24:25.281 --> 24:27.492
and I'm thinking
Da Vinci's "Last Supper."

24:27.658 --> 24:30.787
Jesus looks sad.
The apostles look miserable.

24:30.953 --> 24:32.789
I don't want
to go to that party.

24:32.955 --> 24:37.126
Shouldn't religion be more like
dogs playing poker?

24:37.293 --> 24:39.045
- Dogs playing...
- Poker.

24:39.212 --> 24:41.798
I can't tell you what
any of the apostles

24:42.006 --> 24:43.841
are doing in The Last Supper,

24:44.050 --> 24:46.260
but I can tell you
that the little white bulldog...

24:46.469 --> 24:48.054
is holding
an ace under the table.

24:49.180 --> 24:52.350
See? That's fun.
I'm engaged.

24:52.517 --> 24:53.726
There's awe and wonderment.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.973
That other stuff is just
all ritual and punishment...

24:56.020 --> 24:58.398
and it's way too weird
and way too serious.

25:01.192 --> 25:02.610
Well, it is.

25:36.853 --> 25:38.187
Go to bed.

26:04.589 --> 26:08.801
Well, aren't you a bunch
of lovely young ladies?

26:09.760 --> 26:12.763
Excited about the prom?
It's coming up.

26:13.347 --> 26:15.433
I'll bet some of you
even have your gowns.

26:16.559 --> 26:19.770
- Who's taking you, Sue?
- Tommy Ross.

26:23.232 --> 26:26.777
Helen?
It must be Roy Everetts.

26:31.949 --> 26:35.995
Chris... I imagine
you can take your pick.

26:36.829 --> 26:38.039
Who's the lucky guy?

26:38.414 --> 26:40.208
Billy Nolan.

26:40.875 --> 26:43.085
- Who?
- Billy Nolan.

26:43.294 --> 26:45.129
Isn't he the lucky one?

26:54.722 --> 26:56.432
Mrs. Johansen?

26:57.600 --> 26:59.310
Yes, dear?

26:59.477 --> 27:01.479
Can you show me
how to do a search?

27:01.646 --> 27:03.064
Hey, I've got an idea.

27:04.148 --> 27:05.942
How about today
we skip softball...

27:06.150 --> 27:07.235
Yeah!

27:07.401 --> 27:11.280
And make boutonnieres for
your prom dates instead?

27:12.782 --> 27:14.659
We can make them out of these.

27:20.831 --> 27:22.208
I'm leaving.

27:23.084 --> 27:24.335
You can't hit us!

27:24.502 --> 27:25.795
I barely touched you.

27:25.962 --> 27:28.381
You'll get canned for this.
See if you don't, you bitch!

27:28.548 --> 27:30.383
I don't really care,
Hargensen.

27:30.591 --> 27:33.302
If you or any of you think

27:33.511 --> 27:35.263
I'm wearing my
teacher hat right now...

27:35.471 --> 27:37.390
you're sadly mistaken.

27:45.773 --> 27:47.149
I want you all to know

27:47.316 --> 27:50.695
what you did on Friday
was a really nasty thing.

27:52.071 --> 27:55.199
Did you stop to think that
Carrie White might have feelings?

27:57.368 --> 28:00.037
Do any of you ever
stop to think?

28:01.080 --> 28:02.331
Sue?

28:02.999 --> 28:05.751
Helen? Tina?

28:07.920 --> 28:10.006
You think she's ugly, don't you?

28:13.134 --> 28:14.927
Well, you're ugly-

28:15.553 --> 28:18.472
I saw just how ugly all of you
are Friday morning.

28:18.681 --> 28:21.267
You can't talk to us like this.
My dad's a lawyer.

28:21.475 --> 28:22.643
Shut up!

28:22.852 --> 28:27.732
Open your mouth one more time,
and I'll plug you up.

28:30.443 --> 28:34.780
My punishment for
this little stunt you pulled...

28:34.947 --> 28:36.365
was three days' suspension...

28:36.532 --> 28:38.284
and refusal
of your prom tickets.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.578
- No!
- What? You can't...

28:40.786 --> 28:42.788
That would've hit you
where you lived, wouldn't it?

28:43.748 --> 28:45.875
And you would deserve it, too.

28:46.417 --> 28:48.294
Unfortunately,
our administration...

28:48.461 --> 28:50.046
is staffed entirely by men.

28:50.212 --> 28:51.631
I don't think they have
the slightest idea

28:51.797 --> 28:54.258
how nasty what you did was...

28:54.425 --> 28:56.719
so you'll get
a week's detention.

28:56.886 --> 28:58.971
But it's my detention...

28:59.180 --> 29:02.808
In the gym
fifty minutes every day.

29:03.017 --> 29:04.769
And I'm gonna run you ragged.

29:11.359 --> 29:13.402
I won't come.

29:13.569 --> 29:15.029
That's up to you, Chris.

29:15.780 --> 29:17.365
That's up to all of you.

29:17.573 --> 29:19.700
Punishment
for skipping detention...

29:19.909 --> 29:21.911
is three days' suspension...

29:22.078 --> 29:24.413
and refusal
of your prom tickets.

29:25.539 --> 29:27.083
Get the picture?

29:27.750 --> 29:31.462
Right. Change up.
Think about what I said.

29:37.635 --> 29:39.679
She can't get away with this.

29:39.887 --> 29:42.306
If we all just stick together,
we can make...

29:42.515 --> 29:43.724
Shut up, Chris.

29:45.351 --> 29:48.688
- Sue...
- Just shut up.

29:50.064 --> 29:51.440
This isn't over.

29:54.068 --> 29:57.029
This is so far from over...

29:57.196 --> 30:01.200
it's not even in
the same area code as over!

30:23.347 --> 30:27.727
So... you and
Christine Hargensen...

30:27.893 --> 30:29.562
friends until the end?

30:29.729 --> 30:32.356
- Wouldn't say that.
- What would you say?

30:32.565 --> 30:34.650
We had our differences.

30:34.817 --> 30:36.444
Differences about Carrie White?

30:36.610 --> 30:38.237
Differences
about a lot of things.

30:38.696 --> 30:40.865
I played with Barbie.
She played with horses.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.868
She's a back to front.
I'm a front to back.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.833
You know
a girl named Donna Kellogg?

30:51.041 --> 30:53.586
Yeah.
I know Kellogg.

30:53.794 --> 30:56.505
Every guy in school
had a bowl of her cereal.

30:58.841 --> 31:00.468
She moved to Rhode Island
junior year.

31:00.676 --> 31:01.969
What about her?

31:02.178 --> 31:05.222
She got an e-mail from Chris
about four days before the prom.

31:05.473 --> 31:06.849
What'd it say?

31:08.142 --> 31:11.187
"Dear Dirty Donna,
so I'm out of the prom..."

31:11.395 --> 31:13.116
"but they're not
going to get away with it."

31:13.189 --> 31:15.233
"I don't know exactly
what we're going to do..."

31:15.399 --> 31:17.610
"but I guarantee you
everyone is going to get..."

31:17.777 --> 31:20.863
"a big... expletive...
surprise."

31:22.948 --> 31:25.034
What do you suppose
she meant by that?

31:27.578 --> 31:28.829
There's the rain forest.

31:28.996 --> 31:30.596
That's when you don't do
anything at all.

31:30.706 --> 31:34.585
Hitler's moustache,
the landing strip, the Brazil.

31:34.794 --> 31:35.836
The Brazil?

31:36.045 --> 31:38.286
What does Brazil have to do
with getting your area waxed?

31:38.422 --> 31:39.840
Is it the shape of the country?

31:40.007 --> 31:41.550
It's because the bikinis
in Brazil are so small...

31:41.717 --> 31:43.969
you have to wax
everything off to wear one.

31:45.888 --> 31:47.848
Where's Brazil anyway?

31:48.516 --> 31:51.769
Hey, Carrie, do you want to sit
in Chris' desk today?

31:51.936 --> 31:53.562
I don't think
she's gonna be using it

31:53.729 --> 31:55.606
since you got her
kicked out of school.

31:56.982 --> 32:00.027
Okay, well, just let me know
if you change your mind.

32:02.780 --> 32:04.949
All right,
butts in the seats.

32:11.205 --> 32:12.957
Six molecules of water...

32:13.123 --> 32:16.085
plus six molecules
of carbon dioxide...

32:16.252 --> 32:20.089
produces one molecule of sugar
and six molecules of oxygen.

32:20.256 --> 32:22.174
What am I talking about?

32:22.341 --> 32:23.634
Photosynthesis.

32:25.261 --> 32:27.596
- Good. Photosynthesis.
- What?

32:27.763 --> 32:28.848
What?

32:30.182 --> 32:31.809
It's carried out
by many different organisms...

32:31.976 --> 32:34.061
ranging from plants
to bacteria.

32:34.228 --> 32:36.313
The main effect
of photosynthesis...

32:36.480 --> 32:40.609
is to increase the overall
amount of carbon dioxide...

32:40.818 --> 32:42.278
in the atmosphere.

32:42.486 --> 32:44.238
The best-known form
of photosynthesis...

32:44.405 --> 32:46.740
is the one carried out
by higher plants and algae...

32:46.907 --> 32:49.285
as well as by bacteria...

33:57.353 --> 33:58.687
Carrie?

34:04.944 --> 34:06.862
You'd better
get to your next class.

34:22.503 --> 34:23.587
Here's what I want.

34:23.754 --> 34:26.590
One... prom tickets
for my daughter.

34:27.216 --> 34:30.636
A girl's senior prom
is important to her...

34:30.844 --> 34:32.346
and Chris is very upset.

34:32.513 --> 34:33.764
Then she shouldn't have
skipped detention.

34:33.931 --> 34:35.516
I wasn't talking to you,
Miss Desjarden.

34:35.683 --> 34:38.851
When I am, you'll know
because I'll be looking at you.

34:40.145 --> 34:41.563
Two...

34:42.690 --> 34:44.984
no contract renewal
for Miss Desjarden.

34:45.150 --> 34:46.985
Well, she's already
been reprimanded.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.237
Not good enough.

34:49.571 --> 34:51.031
This is her first year at Ewen?

34:51.239 --> 34:53.367
Yes, and we're very pleased.

34:53.534 --> 34:54.618
You're pleased?

34:54.784 --> 34:56.996
With teachers who throw
students against lockers...

34:57.162 --> 34:59.242
and then assault them
with feminine hygiene products?

34:59.373 --> 35:02.001
That is a slightly exaggerated
version of events.

35:02.209 --> 35:03.168
Is it?

35:03.377 --> 35:05.170
Yes, it is.

35:05.379 --> 35:07.047
Besides, the state
acknowledges

35:07.256 --> 35:09.299
the school's title
to "in loco parentis."

35:09.466 --> 35:12.302
We succeed to full parental
rights during school hours.

35:12.469 --> 35:15.764
You might look at Clarkson County
School District vs. Crane.

35:18.684 --> 35:21.979
The Crane case you administrators
are so fond of quoting...

35:22.187 --> 35:24.273
doesn't cover anything
remotely concerned

35:24.481 --> 35:25.816
with physical or verbal abuse.

35:25.983 --> 35:27.776
Lewiston School District
vs. David Duzzer.

35:27.943 --> 35:29.611
Are you familiar with that one?

35:29.820 --> 35:30.946
Yes.

35:31.155 --> 35:33.365
Then I don't have
to tell you who won.

35:33.532 --> 35:35.534
If I took you
to court on this...

35:35.701 --> 35:37.327
I could walk out
with Desjarden's dismissal...

35:37.494 --> 35:39.955
and a hefty damage settlement
in my pocket.

35:40.122 --> 35:43.000
But I don't want to be
vindictive.

35:45.252 --> 35:48.172
So, if I don't
agree to your demands...

35:48.338 --> 35:50.257
you will take me to court.

35:50.841 --> 35:52.468
Off to court we'd go.

35:52.676 --> 35:55.804
For physical
and verbal abuse, that right?

35:56.847 --> 35:58.307
Essentially.

36:00.768 --> 36:02.311
Mr. Hargensen...

36:02.519 --> 36:04.813
are you aware that your daughter
and her friends...

36:04.980 --> 36:07.301
cornered one of their classmates
in the ladies locker room?

36:07.441 --> 36:08.859
A girl named Carrie White?

36:09.026 --> 36:10.152
She was having
her first period...

36:10.360 --> 36:11.820
and she thought she was dying.

36:13.113 --> 36:16.241
Anyway, they cornered her
and yelled obscenities at her...

36:16.408 --> 36:18.702
and then they filled
her locker up with tampons

36:18.869 --> 36:21.205
and wrote "Plug it up"
on the door.

36:21.371 --> 36:23.082
Are you aware of that?

36:23.290 --> 36:24.958
I'm not a lawyer,
Mr. Hargensen...

36:25.125 --> 36:28.837
but that sounds a lot like
physical and verbal abuse to me.

36:30.422 --> 36:32.462
I'm not going to sit here
and listen to half-truths.

36:32.549 --> 36:33.884
I think I know
my daughter well enough...

36:34.051 --> 36:35.511
I don't think you
know your daughter

36:35.719 --> 36:36.999
quite as well
as you might think.

36:37.137 --> 36:38.847
If I may...

36:39.014 --> 36:40.849
let's see here.

36:42.226 --> 36:45.145
Four years, graduates in May.

36:45.354 --> 36:47.147
Tested IQ of 140.

36:47.314 --> 36:49.525
Detention, 73.

36:49.691 --> 36:51.985
20 for harassment
of other students.

36:52.152 --> 36:54.863
This, by the way,
is your daughter's file.

36:55.697 --> 36:57.116
And look at that.

36:57.282 --> 37:00.118
Despite a "C" average,
she's been admitted to Oberlin.

37:01.829 --> 37:03.455
Pull some strings, John?

37:04.998 --> 37:06.458
I'll see you in court.

37:06.667 --> 37:08.168
Court it is.

37:10.045 --> 37:11.588
Oh, and Mr. Hargensen...

37:11.755 --> 37:12.956
The minute
you file for damages

37:13.048 --> 37:14.769
on the grounds of
physical and verbal abuse,

37:14.883 --> 37:16.218
I will cross-file
against your daughter

37:16.385 --> 37:18.053
on those same grounds
on behalf of Carrie White

37:18.220 --> 37:20.931
and the other nineteen students
in this folder.

37:21.098 --> 37:22.141
Parent-teacher night...

37:22.307 --> 37:25.185
is the first Tuesday
of even-numbered months.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.938
Hope you stop by.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.696
Did he really say,
"I'll see you in court"?

37:52.087 --> 37:53.088
Hey.

37:53.714 --> 37:55.174
Sue, over here.

37:56.008 --> 37:58.385
- Hey, Suze.
- Hey, Billy.

37:58.594 --> 38:00.304
I heard you dry-heaved
in detention.

38:00.470 --> 38:02.097
Heard your dad
dropped the lawsuit.

38:02.890 --> 38:04.141
He's such a wuss.

38:04.349 --> 38:05.475
It doesn't matter, though.

38:05.684 --> 38:07.144
We're gonna crash
the prom anyway,

38:07.352 --> 38:08.562
you know, like in protest
or something.

38:08.770 --> 38:10.314
Good luck with that.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.274
I'm totally joking.

38:12.482 --> 38:15.277
Oh, and thanks for having
my back with Desjarden.

38:15.485 --> 38:17.654
Maybe if I wasn't the only one
who skipped detention...

38:17.821 --> 38:19.156
we could've made a point.

38:19.323 --> 38:22.326
I think the rest of us kind of
wanted to go to the prom, Chris.

38:22.492 --> 38:24.494
Besides, what we did sucked.

38:24.661 --> 38:26.622
That's such a load of crap.

38:26.788 --> 38:28.790
This is Carrie White's fault.

38:28.957 --> 38:30.918
She walks around like
she gets her Massengill...

38:31.084 --> 38:32.878
blessed down at Holy Family.

38:33.045 --> 38:34.922
She freaked out.
Cut her some slack.

38:35.130 --> 38:36.632
She's always freaking out.

38:36.798 --> 38:38.300
Like that time
she had that seizure...

38:38.467 --> 38:41.595
and told everyone
she was speaking in tongues.

38:41.803 --> 38:43.805
Maybe she thought
she was speaking in tongues.

38:43.972 --> 38:45.557
Please. She's been
working that martyr bit...

38:45.724 --> 38:48.268
since the first grade,
and I'm sick of it.

38:48.435 --> 38:50.103
Yeah, you'll be strong.

38:51.605 --> 38:53.523
Look, where do you get off

38:53.732 --> 38:55.901
acting so righteous
all of a sudden?

38:56.443 --> 38:57.843
I seem to remember
you were in there

38:57.986 --> 38:59.446
chanting with the rest of us.

39:04.117 --> 39:05.452
Yeah.

39:06.078 --> 39:07.579
Yeah, you're right.

39:08.205 --> 39:12.000
Look, Tommy's waiting,
so I'll see you later, OK?

41:05.489 --> 41:09.951
Carrie?
Have you said your prayers?

41:10.118 --> 41:12.120
I'm saying them now, Mama.

41:18.168 --> 41:19.544
I'm talking to you.

41:19.711 --> 41:21.505
I said I'm saying them now!

41:32.933 --> 41:34.309
Are you high?

41:35.519 --> 41:39.731
Seriously... are you high?

41:39.898 --> 41:41.024
No.

41:41.191 --> 41:42.526
We should have a rule.

41:42.692 --> 41:45.153
If they do something
in a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie...

41:45.320 --> 41:46.881
we're not allowed
to do it in real life.

41:46.988 --> 41:48.198
What are you talking about?

41:48.365 --> 41:51.326
You want me to take
Carrie White to the prom?

41:51.493 --> 41:52.702
Yeah.

41:53.245 --> 41:54.704
It's like in that movie.

41:55.205 --> 41:57.207
Freddie bets this dude
that he can turn

41:57.416 --> 41:59.418
some she-geek
into the prom queen.

42:00.001 --> 42:02.295
Except, unlike Carrie White,
this chick's a supermodel

42:02.504 --> 42:05.966
but we're not supposed to know
because she's wearing glasses.

42:07.217 --> 42:09.052
Anyway, it's a bad idea.

42:09.261 --> 42:10.929
It's a good idea.

42:11.388 --> 42:12.806
It's totally mean.

42:14.141 --> 42:16.685
She'll think it's a joke,
and so will everyone else.

42:16.893 --> 42:19.187
Just leave her alone.

42:19.729 --> 42:22.274
She won't think it's a joke
if you don't make it a joke.

42:22.858 --> 42:24.359
Ask her.

42:25.235 --> 42:26.528
She'll say no.

42:26.736 --> 42:27.904
She'll say yes.

42:28.113 --> 42:32.075
She likes you, you're cute
and non-threatening.

42:33.660 --> 42:34.786
Take her to the prom.

42:36.371 --> 42:39.416
Take her and be nice to her
and hold her hand.

42:42.294 --> 42:43.712
Please?

43:03.231 --> 43:04.608
Carrie!

43:07.611 --> 43:09.154
Sorry.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.285
What are you reading?

43:15.494 --> 43:19.581
Nothing.
Just something about sewing.

43:25.754 --> 43:27.339
How have you been?

43:27.839 --> 43:29.674
OK.

43:34.387 --> 43:36.640
So if you don't
have a date for prom...

43:36.806 --> 43:38.183
you want to go with me?

43:40.727 --> 43:41.811
What?

43:41.978 --> 43:43.813
Prom.
It's on Friday.

43:43.980 --> 43:45.899
I know it's kind of
late notice and all-

43:46.066 --> 43:47.484
I don't like being tricked.

43:47.692 --> 43:51.488
Carrie,
Carrie, it's... Carrie.

43:51.863 --> 43:54.115
The little creep
didn't even call me.

43:54.282 --> 43:56.284
- I mean who doesn't call me?
- I would call him.

43:56.451 --> 43:57.702
Carrie...

43:57.869 --> 44:00.497
Does everyone think they can
go on playing tricks on me?

44:00.664 --> 44:02.290
It's not a trick.

44:02.457 --> 44:04.584
I know who you hang around with.

44:05.544 --> 44:08.713
Who I hang around with
has nothing to do with this.

44:08.922 --> 44:11.716
I'm asking you
because I want to.

44:12.509 --> 44:13.635
Why?

44:13.843 --> 44:16.721
Because you're different.

44:18.014 --> 44:19.933
I don't mean that in a bad way.

44:20.141 --> 44:22.143
It's actually kind of cool...

44:22.310 --> 44:25.814
like anti-establishment
or something.

44:27.774 --> 44:30.235
OK, you're not different.

44:30.402 --> 44:34.155
You're... mysterious.

44:35.907 --> 44:37.158
How's that?

44:43.290 --> 44:45.250
What about Sue Snell?

44:46.126 --> 44:47.252
What about her?

44:48.461 --> 44:50.005
She's your girlfriend.

44:50.171 --> 44:51.923
Why aren't you taking her?

44:52.966 --> 44:54.384
She doesn't want to go.

44:55.427 --> 44:58.513
I asked her
if I could take you

44:58.680 --> 45:02.684
and she said
it was a really good idea.

45:04.477 --> 45:06.521
Why would she say that?

45:07.564 --> 45:09.232
Can you keep a secret?

45:10.233 --> 45:11.943
I mean it.
If it gets back to Sue

45:12.152 --> 45:14.446
that I told you this,
she'll kill me.

45:14.946 --> 45:16.406
I won't tell.

45:19.367 --> 45:21.620
She thinks
you're really interesting.

45:23.038 --> 45:25.999
She says you've got a lot more
going on than people know.

45:26.207 --> 45:27.792
And I think a
part of her wants to

45:27.959 --> 45:30.420
see the look on
Chris Hargensen's face

45:30.629 --> 45:34.633
when she finds out you're going
to prom and she isn't.

45:36.343 --> 45:38.094
I would love to, I would.

45:38.303 --> 45:39.471
Then say yes.

45:40.263 --> 45:43.141
No.
It would be a nightmare.

45:43.308 --> 45:46.478
Come on. Today is the last day
to buy tickets.

45:51.441 --> 45:53.485
I'm going to be late for class.

45:57.447 --> 45:59.658
- Will you?
- I can't.

45:59.824 --> 46:01.910
- You're going.
- They'll laugh.

46:02.077 --> 46:03.828
No one will laugh.

46:04.037 --> 46:06.039
If they do,
I'll kick their ass.

46:12.212 --> 46:13.546
OK.

46:14.839 --> 46:16.216
Is that a yes?

46:16.424 --> 46:18.885
Yes, I'll go.

46:19.052 --> 46:21.096
I'll pick you up at 7:30.

46:21.763 --> 46:23.181
Fine.

46:29.354 --> 46:30.563
Thank you.

46:30.772 --> 46:33.316
It's gonna be fun.
Don't worry.

46:43.743 --> 46:45.662
My God.

46:46.621 --> 46:48.790
Do you know what it means
to conspire, Sue?

46:48.998 --> 46:52.669
Yeah. It's when you plot to do
something behind someone's back.

46:52.836 --> 46:57.006
You make a secret plan
to commit unlawful acts.

46:57.215 --> 46:58.299
What did I just say?

46:59.050 --> 47:01.010
You see, some people are
having trouble believing

47:01.177 --> 47:04.431
that you had your boyfriend Tommy
take Carrie White to the prom

47:04.597 --> 47:06.141
out of the kindness
of your heart.

47:06.349 --> 47:07.726
What is that supposed to mean?

47:07.892 --> 47:10.103
Both Tommy and Chris
are friends of yours.

47:10.270 --> 47:11.980
Look, I told you, OK?

47:12.147 --> 47:13.732
Chris and I had a falling out.

47:13.898 --> 47:15.942
I'd like to believe that,
but...

47:17.026 --> 47:19.904
The going theory
is that the three of you

47:20.071 --> 47:21.865
conspired to get
Carrie White to the prom

47:22.073 --> 47:23.366
so you could humiliate her.

47:24.075 --> 47:27.495
Something went wrong and
a lot of people were killed.

47:38.173 --> 47:41.259
You haven't touched your cake.
It's Betty Crocker.

47:48.141 --> 47:49.726
Cake gives me pimples.

47:49.934 --> 47:51.853
Just the Lord's way
of chastising you.

47:57.066 --> 47:58.318
Mama?

47:58.526 --> 47:59.652
Yes?

48:03.740 --> 48:05.700
I got invited to the prom.

48:12.165 --> 48:14.542
He's a real nice boy.

48:14.751 --> 48:16.232
He promised he'd come in
and meet you.

48:16.419 --> 48:17.253
No.

48:21.716 --> 48:24.511
He said would have
me home by 11:00.

48:24.719 --> 48:27.138
No. No. No.

48:29.599 --> 48:31.601
I've already accepted.

48:37.941 --> 48:41.361
I have to try to get
along with people, Mama.

48:42.654 --> 48:44.405
I'm not like you.

48:45.490 --> 48:47.116
I'm weird.

48:48.701 --> 48:51.371
Everybody thinks I'm weird...

48:52.705 --> 48:54.374
and I don't want to be.

48:54.874 --> 48:57.460
I want to try and be normal.

48:58.586 --> 49:01.881
You're not going.
It's evil and it's a sin.

49:02.048 --> 49:03.216
Everything isn't a sin, Mama.

49:03.383 --> 49:06.386
- Go to your closet and pray.
- No!

49:06.553 --> 49:08.596
You're not going
and that's final.

49:08.805 --> 49:11.140
Mama, please sit down
and talk with me!

49:14.727 --> 49:16.479
I'm not done talking yet.

49:31.244 --> 49:33.830
Mama!!!

49:37.417 --> 49:42.046
Please sit and talk with me.

49:45.258 --> 49:47.385
I want to start living
my own life.

49:50.513 --> 49:52.140
I don't like yours.

49:53.600 --> 49:55.143
Witch!

49:55.351 --> 49:57.604
I'm not a witch.
I just...

49:57.812 --> 49:59.188
Sometimes...

50:01.190 --> 50:02.859
I can move things.

50:04.986 --> 50:07.614
I should have known
when you let the fire come.

50:08.740 --> 50:10.825
Sin never dies.

50:11.034 --> 50:13.661
I'm not the only one, Mama.
Other people can do it, too.

50:13.828 --> 50:14.871
I read about them
on the internet.

50:15.038 --> 50:17.165
The internet?

50:22.295 --> 50:24.923
Things are going to change
around here, Mama.

50:27.300 --> 50:29.135
That boy...

50:30.553 --> 50:32.472
He's like all the rest, Carrie.

50:32.680 --> 50:34.140
I don't care!

50:35.558 --> 50:37.393
He asked me to go and I'm going.

50:37.560 --> 50:39.646
You can't stop me.

50:45.902 --> 50:48.363
I don't want
to talk about it anymore.

50:49.906 --> 50:51.866
You look at a girl
like Carrie White

50:52.033 --> 50:53.785
and you don't know
if you want to slap her

50:53.952 --> 50:55.286
or feel sorry for her.

50:55.495 --> 50:57.789
She's just sort of pathetic.

50:58.581 --> 51:00.124
Can I have another one?

51:01.542 --> 51:02.961
They're really good.

51:04.045 --> 51:05.588
Hot right now.

51:05.797 --> 51:08.675
I mean, I have nothing
against her.

51:08.841 --> 51:10.259
I'm sad she died and all,

51:10.468 --> 51:12.178
but I'm sad
everyone dies, you know?

51:13.805 --> 51:16.516
How well did you know
Christine Hargensen and Sue Snell?

51:17.141 --> 51:18.351
I had a few classes
with them

51:18.559 --> 51:20.103
but we weren't really friends.

51:21.020 --> 51:22.146
They were ultras.

51:22.355 --> 51:23.523
Ultras?

51:23.856 --> 51:27.276
Ultra-popular,
ultra-pretty, ultra-etc.

51:27.485 --> 51:29.112
And you weren't?

51:29.904 --> 51:31.990
I'm senior class president.

51:32.156 --> 51:36.202
Apparently it wasn't cool to be
passionate about school spirit.

51:36.661 --> 51:37.870
I see.

51:38.079 --> 51:40.498
It's like this: You got
your jocks and your ultras

51:40.707 --> 51:41.867
at the top of the food chain,

51:42.000 --> 51:44.252
then your student body leaders,
such as myself,

51:44.419 --> 51:45.939
and then the brains
and then the geeks,

51:46.087 --> 51:47.422
which is
a subtle distinction

51:47.588 --> 51:49.424
because brains tend to be
more aesthetically pleasing

51:49.632 --> 51:52.010
and less likely to join
the marching band or choir.

51:52.635 --> 51:55.346
Where was Carrie White
on this food chain?

51:55.555 --> 51:58.307
As far down as you can go.
She was a Plath.

51:58.474 --> 52:02.103
Everyone made fun of her,
especially the ultras.

52:03.021 --> 52:04.781
Did Chris or Sue ever
give you any indication

52:04.856 --> 52:06.774
that they were planning
to harm Carrie?

52:09.402 --> 52:10.611
You think what happened...

52:10.778 --> 52:13.179
You think that was all because
someone wanted to hurt Carrie?

52:25.626 --> 52:29.714
I'm seventeen.
High school. I'm a senior.

52:31.299 --> 52:35.178
What kind of counseling?
Like a guidance counselor?

52:38.014 --> 52:40.641
No.
Nothing like that.

52:42.643 --> 52:44.645
Would they know
what's happening to me?

52:46.314 --> 52:52.153
So, if I just think it's real

52:52.361 --> 52:53.946
and it's not,
how would I know?

52:54.739 --> 52:58.076
I mean, it feels real...

52:58.284 --> 53:00.536
We're not supposed
to use that phone.

53:04.123 --> 53:05.750
I was talking to my mom.

53:05.958 --> 53:07.799
Didn't sound like
you were talking to your mom.

53:08.920 --> 53:10.588
We were having a fight.

53:11.672 --> 53:13.716
I always fight with my mom.

53:13.925 --> 53:15.468
Always hang up on her, too.

53:16.427 --> 53:19.764
So I take it you've leveled out
since last Friday?

53:21.474 --> 53:23.476
Your little episode?

53:25.103 --> 53:27.063
You went all fetal
in the shower.

53:30.483 --> 53:31.859
What about it?

53:32.068 --> 53:35.530
You have to admit,
you totally overreacted.

53:35.696 --> 53:37.240
We were just messing around.

53:37.448 --> 53:39.992
We wouldn't give you a hard time
if we didn't like you.

53:40.785 --> 53:43.663
We all really like you,
you know that, right?

53:44.622 --> 53:45.915
What do you want?

53:46.124 --> 53:49.585
Don't get all pissy.
I'm only trying to be nice.

53:51.212 --> 53:53.923
So, are your boobs sore?

53:55.091 --> 53:56.634
What?

53:56.843 --> 53:58.886
You look a little bloated.

53:59.053 --> 54:01.681
When I'm bloated,
my boobs get really sore.

54:01.848 --> 54:04.308
You're only supposed
to take like two Ibuprofen.

54:04.517 --> 54:06.936
I take three.
Got that from Sue.

54:07.436 --> 54:09.188
She's like a total junkie.

54:09.605 --> 54:10.940
Now that you guys
are all cozy

54:11.149 --> 54:13.401
she'll have you tossing them
back like communion wafers.

54:14.110 --> 54:17.029
I'm not cozy with Sue Snell.

54:17.196 --> 54:19.323
Really? She's acting like
you're her new best friend.

54:20.616 --> 54:22.493
Don't get me wrong.
I think it's great.

54:22.660 --> 54:24.704
Just don't let her

54:24.871 --> 54:28.124
turn you into another
one of her "projects."

54:28.958 --> 54:30.918
Did she say I was a project?

54:31.127 --> 54:34.172
It's her M.O.
Helen was a project.

54:34.380 --> 54:35.798
I was a project.

54:36.382 --> 54:37.925
She practically
talked me into

54:38.092 --> 54:40.678
getting Botox last summer.
Can you believe that?

54:40.887 --> 54:43.055
Maybe she thought you needed it.

54:46.225 --> 54:48.853
I'm just saying that
she has a hard time

54:49.020 --> 54:51.397
accepting people
for who they are.

54:52.440 --> 54:55.776
Being her friend can be
a little on the demeaning side.

54:55.985 --> 54:57.987
Especially when
everyone in school

54:58.196 --> 54:59.739
knows why
she's being your friend.

55:04.660 --> 55:08.748
And tell Sue she can say
all she wants about me...

55:08.956 --> 55:11.459
but at least when
I'm being a bitch I'll cop to it.

55:14.795 --> 55:15.963
Bye.

55:49.205 --> 55:50.581
- Hi.
- Hi.

55:50.748 --> 55:52.458
So, you come here often?

55:52.625 --> 55:54.001
No.

55:56.420 --> 56:00.091
You have trouble
coloring inside the lines.

56:06.430 --> 56:09.058
You know, you might want to try
something a little less drastic.

56:12.520 --> 56:13.980
Like this one.

56:19.443 --> 56:23.364
Curve it around the bow
of your lips like so...

56:25.032 --> 56:26.158
and...

56:26.867 --> 56:28.911
now, rub them together.

56:30.121 --> 56:31.539
Now smack.

56:34.166 --> 56:35.334
Yep.

56:36.919 --> 56:38.959
You can add some lip liner
for a little extra drama.

56:42.466 --> 56:46.846
That's not what that's for.

56:49.724 --> 56:51.183
Have you picked out your dress?

56:53.519 --> 56:55.521
No, but I found one
that I like.

56:55.730 --> 56:59.317
- What color?
- I can't decide.

56:59.483 --> 57:00.923
Well, I don't know.
If you want to...

57:01.110 --> 57:03.654
we could do
a fashion consultation thing.

57:04.572 --> 57:05.823
We could even model.

57:06.824 --> 57:08.659
I don't think I want to model.

57:12.163 --> 57:14.707
Well, anyway...

57:14.915 --> 57:17.126
I'm really glad that
you're going to the prom.

57:20.504 --> 57:21.589
Why?

57:23.507 --> 57:25.468
I just thought
you'd have a good time.

57:25.676 --> 57:27.094
That's all.

57:28.262 --> 57:32.475
Why? Why do you care
if I have a good time?

57:35.311 --> 57:38.314
I mean, you never really
talked to me before...

57:38.522 --> 57:41.567
and the only reason
you're talking to me now...

57:41.734 --> 57:43.778
is because none of
your friends are around.

57:45.571 --> 57:46.530
Look...

57:47.490 --> 57:50.076
If you don't want to go,
then don't go.

57:50.284 --> 57:51.744
No, I didn't say
I don't want to go.

57:51.911 --> 57:54.622
I just wish I was going
because someone liked me,

57:54.789 --> 57:56.791
not because someone
feels sorry for me.

57:57.625 --> 57:59.251
This is not a pity thing.

57:59.418 --> 58:00.961
I don't feel sorry for you.

58:01.170 --> 58:03.297
Yeah, you do.

58:06.300 --> 58:07.468
You feel sorry for me

58:07.676 --> 58:10.388
because you think
you're better than me.

58:11.305 --> 58:13.516
I don't think
I'm better than you.

58:15.267 --> 58:19.313
It's OK.
Everyone does.

58:22.525 --> 58:24.318
Doesn't mean it's true, though.

58:28.364 --> 58:30.116
I really like this color.

58:33.244 --> 58:35.496
Thank you for helping me
pick it out.

58:42.920 --> 58:45.631
You guys, come on.
We don't have that much time!

58:47.216 --> 58:48.634
Be careful with that!

58:49.760 --> 58:51.887
- Everybody's been talking.
- What are they saying?

58:52.096 --> 58:54.515
That you and Carrie White
are having a lesbian affair

58:54.682 --> 58:57.393
and you had Tommy take her
to prom to throw people off.

58:57.560 --> 59:02.940
It's just that Carrie satisfies me
in a way no one else can.

59:03.107 --> 59:04.400
I bet.

59:04.567 --> 59:06.444
I feel bad about what happened.

59:06.610 --> 59:08.863
Great. So you're
a saint and we're all bitches.

59:09.071 --> 59:10.573
Something like that.

59:10.739 --> 59:11.866
Ladies? More mauve?

59:12.032 --> 59:14.910
It looks like you might
be running a little low.

59:16.203 --> 59:18.456
I can't believe
Tommy's going along with it.

59:18.831 --> 59:21.584
He's been very agreeable
since we started having sex.

59:21.792 --> 59:23.711
Right on!

59:32.261 --> 59:34.096
Has Chris said anything?

59:34.305 --> 59:36.474
Only that she hates your guts.

59:39.018 --> 59:40.519
Think she might try something?

59:41.854 --> 59:43.105
I don't know.

59:46.525 --> 59:49.153
Got your 911.
Ever so dramatic.

59:49.320 --> 59:51.405
Let me just reiterate...
Oh, my God!

59:51.572 --> 59:52.990
- What?
- Come here.

59:53.157 --> 59:54.366
- What?
- Get over here.

59:54.533 --> 59:56.213
Norma will have an aneurysm
if she sees us.

59:56.243 --> 59:57.703
I saw her head
into the crapper.

59:58.537 --> 59:59.872
So what's this?

01:00:00.039 --> 01:00:01.624
Nothing.

01:00:01.790 --> 01:00:03.876
Just the king and queen
ballots for prom.

01:00:04.043 --> 01:00:07.922
- OK. David and Rachel.
- No.

01:00:08.088 --> 01:00:10.132
No way.
Rachel's in drama club.

01:00:10.299 --> 01:00:12.510
Peter and Myra... No.
Frank and Jessica.

01:00:12.676 --> 01:00:16.430
Maybe. Roy and Helen.
Forget it.

01:00:16.597 --> 01:00:17.973
Tommy and Sue?
I didn't think...

01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.893
That's the old ballot.
This is the new ballot,

01:00:21.101 --> 01:00:23.229
or as I like to call it,
Ballot 2.0.

01:00:25.356 --> 01:00:26.982
Tommy and Carrie?

01:00:31.570 --> 01:00:33.155
That bitch.

01:00:33.364 --> 01:00:35.824
I know. It's like
the whole world's gone insane.

01:00:39.411 --> 01:00:41.830
Tina, you're a peach.

01:00:42.331 --> 01:00:44.625
- I gotta make a phone call.
- OK!

01:00:49.880 --> 01:00:52.299
Hey, Billy? It's Chris.

01:00:52.466 --> 01:00:54.885
You're never gonna guess
what I just found out.

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:58.097
You ready?
Oh... Hi, Sue!

01:01:19.368 --> 01:01:20.995
Want some tea, Mama?

01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:35.426
Mama!!!

01:01:37.511 --> 01:01:40.014
Do you like
this one or this one?

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:46.937
I think this one's real pretty.

01:01:47.354 --> 01:01:48.856
It's godless.

01:01:50.774 --> 01:01:52.693
It's not godless, Mama.

01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.739
I wish you could be happy
for me.

01:01:59.867 --> 01:02:01.785
There's a mark on you now.

01:02:03.203 --> 01:02:04.496
This one's prettier.

01:02:06.790 --> 01:02:08.459
Woe to the woman
who makes garments

01:02:08.626 --> 01:02:10.544
with lustful purpose,
for she is prideful

01:02:10.711 --> 01:02:13.464
and curses
and rejects the Lord.

01:02:14.673 --> 01:02:17.009
Sometimes I think
you make those things up.

01:02:17.217 --> 01:02:20.012
"Ezekiel," Chapter 13.
Read it for yourself.

01:02:21.055 --> 01:02:22.306
I'll read it later.

01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.809
- Read it now.
- I'm busy, Mama.

01:02:35.653 --> 01:02:38.739
You've gone so far astray,
I fear for you.

01:02:40.574 --> 01:02:42.660
You really think
I'm gonna burn in hell, Mama,

01:02:42.868 --> 01:02:44.119
just for going to my prom?

01:02:44.286 --> 01:02:46.566
I don't want to think about
what's going to happen to you.

01:02:48.123 --> 01:02:50.376
Sin knows you now.
It'll find you.

01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:53.128
Your sin will find you,
Carrie,

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:56.965
and when it does,
not even Jesus can help you.

01:02:58.217 --> 01:02:59.843
Jesus will help me.

01:03:01.387 --> 01:03:03.514
He will help me
if I really need him.

01:03:05.724 --> 01:03:07.518
Not if he doesn't
love you anymore.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.949
Jesus loves everybody, Mama.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:27.121
Even me.

01:03:35.379 --> 01:03:37.047
I'm impressed, Jackie.

01:03:37.923 --> 01:03:39.717
I am impressed.

01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:42.928
Four counts of possession,
one with intent to sell.

01:03:43.721 --> 01:03:45.305
Vandalism...

01:03:45.472 --> 01:03:47.850
disturbing the peace,
drunk and disorderly.

01:03:48.016 --> 01:03:49.435
Bay, I...

01:03:49.643 --> 01:03:52.521
Your parents must be
awfully proud of you.

01:03:53.897 --> 01:03:56.316
My parents died when I was six.

01:03:57.276 --> 01:03:58.819
Not so funny now, is it?

01:03:59.695 --> 01:04:00.946
Well, it sure is funny odd

01:04:01.155 --> 01:04:03.991
because I just talked
to Louise and Jackie Sr.

01:04:04.199 --> 01:04:05.367
Not an hour ago,

01:04:05.576 --> 01:04:08.996
both very much alive
and very concerned.

01:04:10.414 --> 01:04:13.917
Jackie, you ever pal around
with a fellow named Billy Nolan?

01:04:16.712 --> 01:04:18.630
How about Christine Hargensen?

01:04:20.507 --> 01:04:21.717
Sue Snell?

01:04:23.677 --> 01:04:26.805
Have you ever been up to
Irwin Hinty's pig farm?

01:04:27.014 --> 01:04:29.975
- Up in North Chamberlain?
- No.

01:04:30.142 --> 01:04:31.435
You never been up there?

01:04:31.602 --> 01:04:35.272
See, Hinty, he didn't have
any security system,

01:04:35.439 --> 01:04:36.857
so people were
knocking fences down

01:04:37.065 --> 01:04:38.984
and stealing hogs
and all kinds of things.

01:04:39.610 --> 01:04:40.736
Is that so?

01:04:40.903 --> 01:04:43.155
Yeah.
So what do you think he does?

01:04:43.322 --> 01:04:46.992
He installs one of those expensive
high-tech security systems.

01:04:47.159 --> 01:04:50.579
Oh, man. It's got one of those
really cool cameras...

01:04:50.746 --> 01:04:52.206
that take pictures in the dark.

01:04:52.372 --> 01:04:54.249
Doggone if
they don't look like

01:04:54.458 --> 01:04:55.417
they were taken
in broad daylight.

01:04:55.626 --> 01:04:57.586
Lookie there.
Look at the detail on that.

01:04:57.795 --> 01:05:00.464
You can just about count the
hairs on that pig's snout, can't you?

01:05:01.882 --> 01:05:04.092
I thought this one
was particularly good of you.

01:05:05.052 --> 01:05:06.595
Don't you think?

01:05:06.804 --> 01:05:08.844
Of course, here's the one of
all three of you there.

01:05:08.931 --> 01:05:11.475
You got...
Here's you and Chris and Billy.

01:05:11.683 --> 01:05:12.893
Looking pretty chummy.

01:05:13.894 --> 01:05:15.687
How come
there's no picture...

01:05:16.772 --> 01:05:18.148
of Sue?

01:05:20.275 --> 01:05:21.777
She wait in the car?

01:05:22.528 --> 01:05:23.654
What?

01:05:23.862 --> 01:05:25.823
Sue Snell?
Where's she?

01:05:27.783 --> 01:05:30.786
How should I know?
She wasn't even there.

01:05:30.953 --> 01:05:33.956
It was my understanding Sue and
Chris planned the whole thing.

01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:37.417
Dude, you don't know what
you're talking about.

01:05:50.681 --> 01:05:53.517
Dude! Ain't this
a lot of work for a joke?

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:55.394
Are you wussing out?

01:05:55.602 --> 01:05:57.604
No.
I was just sayin'.

01:05:58.188 --> 01:05:59.898
I mean, it's a good joke.

01:06:16.498 --> 01:06:18.750
Piggy, Piggy, Piggy!

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:28.260
Billy!

01:06:33.307 --> 01:06:34.391
Who's a Pie?

01:06:36.351 --> 01:06:38.353
Here, Piggy, Piggy, Piggy!

01:06:40.647 --> 01:06:42.649
- Dude, hurry up!
- You want to do this?

01:06:44.735 --> 01:06:46.194
Then shut your pie hole.

01:06:55.954 --> 01:06:57.331
Whenever you're ready, man.

01:07:18.310 --> 01:07:19.353
I can't.

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:24.024
You do it.

01:07:24.232 --> 01:07:25.651
Are you kidding me?

01:07:29.571 --> 01:07:31.114
Dude, don't look at me.

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:33.617
I don't believe you.

01:07:33.825 --> 01:07:35.160
Take it!

01:07:36.453 --> 01:07:37.871
Seriously, take it!

01:07:43.460 --> 01:07:44.586
Fine.

01:07:45.545 --> 01:07:47.381
But you gotta cut
its throat.

01:07:48.465 --> 01:07:49.758
No way.

01:07:49.925 --> 01:07:51.677
Don't tell me no way.
You're doing it.

01:07:51.885 --> 01:07:53.470
Dude-

01:07:53.679 --> 01:07:55.472
Why are you still talking?
Just do it!

01:07:55.681 --> 01:07:57.057
You're doing it.

01:08:21.331 --> 01:08:25.085
Little pigs, little pigs,
let me in.

01:08:25.292 --> 01:08:28.630
Not by the hair
on your chinny chinny chin.

01:08:30.090 --> 01:08:34.219
Then I'll huff and I'll puff...

01:08:36.930 --> 01:08:39.057
and I'll bash your brains in.

01:08:54.906 --> 01:08:57.451
Hinty's gonna drop a hot stack
when he sees this.

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:43.765
I should have known
it would be red.

01:10:43.974 --> 01:10:45.350
It's pink, Mama.

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:50.397
I can see your dirty pillows.
Everyone will.

01:10:51.231 --> 01:10:54.151
They're called breasts, Mama.
All the girls have them.

01:10:54.359 --> 01:10:56.027
They're very fashionable
these days.

01:10:58.238 --> 01:11:00.198
Take off the dress.

01:11:00.574 --> 01:11:01.700
No.

01:11:04.077 --> 01:11:06.204
I don't want to lose you,
Carrie.

01:11:07.122 --> 01:11:11.042
Now, I'm begging you.
Take off that dress.

01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:12.294
No, Mama!

01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:15.005
We can burn it together
and pray for forgiveness.

01:11:15.213 --> 01:11:18.466
Please...
don't be like them.

01:11:19.134 --> 01:11:21.469
I'll try to be home by 11:00.

01:11:21.636 --> 01:11:23.471
I'll call you
if I'm gonna be later.

01:11:27.058 --> 01:11:28.810
They'll laugh at you.

01:11:29.895 --> 01:11:31.104
They always have.

01:11:31.313 --> 01:11:33.773
Go away, Mama.
You're making me nervous.

01:11:33.940 --> 01:11:36.151
Burn the dress, Carrie.
It's the only way.

01:11:36.318 --> 01:11:38.945
Burn it and
pray for forgiveness.

01:11:39.112 --> 01:11:40.280
Go away!

01:11:40.447 --> 01:11:43.116
Jezebel fell from the tower...

01:11:43.283 --> 01:11:45.911
and so will you.
It's in the Bible.

01:11:50.165 --> 01:11:51.666
Stop it. Stop it.

01:11:52.834 --> 01:11:54.211
Stop that!

01:11:54.419 --> 01:11:55.837
I love you, Mama!
I'm sorry!

01:11:56.004 --> 01:11:57.756
Watch your fingers!

01:13:30.348 --> 01:13:32.142
He's not coming.

01:13:55.206 --> 01:13:57.834
- Hello?
- Just a minute!

01:13:58.001 --> 01:13:59.002
Are you OK?

01:13:59.210 --> 01:14:02.088
I'm fine!
I'll be right there!

01:14:07.385 --> 01:14:11.973
So, did your ceiling
just collapse or something?

01:14:14.476 --> 01:14:18.188
Yes. Yes, my ceiling
just collapsed just now.

01:14:18.396 --> 01:14:21.649
Whoa. Can I see it?

01:14:23.026 --> 01:14:24.361
No.

01:15:23.962 --> 01:15:25.588
You look...

01:15:27.048 --> 01:15:28.383
really beautiful.

01:15:30.718 --> 01:15:32.178
So do you.

01:15:35.348 --> 01:15:36.850
Do you want your corsage?

01:15:40.895 --> 01:15:42.188
Yes.

01:15:52.073 --> 01:15:53.199
After you.

01:17:02.393 --> 01:17:03.853
It's quarter to eight!

01:17:06.523 --> 01:17:07.899
Hey!
It's quarter to eight!

01:17:08.066 --> 01:17:11.236
- I heard you!
- Then say something, dude!

01:17:13.613 --> 01:17:15.448
Maybe it's a bad idea.

01:17:16.115 --> 01:17:17.992
It's a good idea.

01:17:26.417 --> 01:17:28.211
It is a really good joke.

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:31.673
Totally good joke.

01:17:44.769 --> 01:17:48.106
Pig blood for a pig.

01:17:48.273 --> 01:17:50.608
- What?
- Nothing.

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:54.487
Get dressed.

01:18:03.246 --> 01:18:05.582
I just can't quite
figure you out.

01:18:06.124 --> 01:18:07.834
I'm an enigma.

01:18:08.042 --> 01:18:09.919
No, you're
just hiding something.

01:18:10.086 --> 01:18:11.546
I'm not hiding anything.

01:18:11.713 --> 01:18:15.383
Yeah, you are. I used
to think that you were

01:18:15.550 --> 01:18:17.677
a part of
Christine Hargensen's agenda

01:18:17.844 --> 01:18:22.098
but Jackie Talbot
has pretty much exonerated you.

01:18:22.849 --> 01:18:24.726
I'm not hiding anything.

01:18:26.728 --> 01:18:30.356
It just seems strange to me
that you're not more upset.

01:18:31.232 --> 01:18:34.027
It's been two weeks.
They've had all the funerals.

01:18:34.235 --> 01:18:36.362
Am I supposed to wear black
for the rest of my life?

01:18:36.571 --> 01:18:37.780
No. That's not
what's bothering me.

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:39.407
Then what is?

01:18:40.408 --> 01:18:43.036
You've just been through
the single most

01:18:43.244 --> 01:18:45.580
traumatic experience
of your life, knock wood,

01:18:45.788 --> 01:18:48.499
and you got something
more important on your mind.

01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:32.460
Nervous?

01:19:34.712 --> 01:19:35.922
Yes.

01:19:37.090 --> 01:19:38.591
Don't be.

01:19:40.259 --> 01:19:43.137
Just pretend you're
somebody else, you know?

01:19:43.304 --> 01:19:46.641
Like you're meeting people
for the first time or something.

01:19:46.849 --> 01:19:48.643
Maybe you should do an accent.

01:19:50.478 --> 01:19:52.980
No. Don't do an accent.
That's dumb.

01:19:53.189 --> 01:19:55.233
But you know what I mean.

01:19:56.567 --> 01:19:58.277
Like "Pygmalion."

01:19:58.486 --> 01:20:01.656
- Pig what?
- "My Fair Lady."

01:20:03.241 --> 01:20:04.992
Yeah, I guess.

01:20:05.993 --> 01:20:08.955
So... don't be nervous.

01:20:12.166 --> 01:20:13.251
You ready?

01:20:14.836 --> 01:20:18.506
Can we just sit here...

01:20:18.965 --> 01:20:20.883
for a few more seconds?

01:20:21.092 --> 01:20:22.427
Sure.

01:20:37.191 --> 01:20:40.945
- OK, I'm ready.
- Wait.

01:21:03.634 --> 01:21:07.680
Sue said she'd cut off my boys
if I wasn't a perfect gentleman.

01:21:16.147 --> 01:21:18.649
OK? Let's go.

01:21:24.363 --> 01:21:26.532
Pull the rope when
they play the school song.

01:21:27.658 --> 01:21:29.076
Pull it hard.

01:21:30.286 --> 01:21:32.747
There'll be a little slack,
but not much.

01:21:33.664 --> 01:21:36.209
When you feel the bucket go...

01:21:37.210 --> 01:21:38.586
run.

01:21:40.630 --> 01:21:42.715
Don't stick around
to see what happens.

01:21:44.425 --> 01:21:45.968
You got it?

01:21:49.764 --> 01:21:50.765
Yes.

01:21:56.813 --> 01:22:01.692
If you get caught
and even mention my name...

01:22:03.611 --> 01:22:05.154
I'll kill you.

01:22:06.405 --> 01:22:07.824
I mean it.

01:22:08.032 --> 01:22:09.826
This is a criminal assault.

01:22:09.992 --> 01:22:11.577
OK.

01:22:13.538 --> 01:22:15.373
God damn.

01:22:15.581 --> 01:22:16.916
OK.

01:22:18.251 --> 01:22:20.169
This is gonna be good.

01:22:21.379 --> 01:22:22.922
Definitely.

01:23:44.837 --> 01:23:46.589
Why, Tommy Ross.

01:23:46.797 --> 01:23:49.717
You look good enough to eat,
honey.

01:23:49.884 --> 01:23:51.802
Some would say I am delicious.

01:23:51.969 --> 01:23:53.554
Okay, if you knew
how many people

01:23:53.721 --> 01:23:55.681
seriously thought
you were gay,

01:23:55.890 --> 01:23:57.600
you wouldn't be joking about it.

01:23:58.893 --> 01:24:00.603
If they decide
to run away together,

01:24:00.770 --> 01:24:01.979
I'll dance with you.

01:24:05.232 --> 01:24:07.818
Oh, my God.
Where did you get that dress?

01:24:08.027 --> 01:24:09.862
- I made it.
- Shut up.

01:24:10.446 --> 01:24:13.699
- You shut up.
- Seriously, you made that?

01:24:13.866 --> 01:24:17.244
I did.
I like to sew.

01:24:18.663 --> 01:24:20.581
It's a real simple pattern.

01:24:21.290 --> 01:24:23.334
- Look at your ass.
- What?

01:24:24.001 --> 01:24:25.670
Okay, now who's gay, right?

01:24:25.836 --> 01:24:26.921
Okay, after seeing your ass

01:24:27.088 --> 01:24:28.631
the whole nun
in street clothes thing

01:24:28.798 --> 01:24:30.174
is no longer acceptable.

01:24:30.341 --> 01:24:33.928
God, here comes Norma.
Life's too short.

01:24:34.595 --> 01:24:35.930
That was a compliment.

01:24:36.138 --> 01:24:40.977
Carrie?
You look so different.

01:24:41.143 --> 01:24:43.396
I can't believe how different.

01:24:43.562 --> 01:24:45.106
- Hi, Norma.
- Hi.

01:24:45.773 --> 01:24:47.566
She's glowing,
don't you think?

01:24:47.775 --> 01:24:49.193
You're glowing.

01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:56.784
Well, I got to get back.

01:24:56.993 --> 01:24:59.787
Isn't this exciting?
I am so excited.

01:25:00.413 --> 01:25:01.872
OK' bye.

01:25:26.147 --> 01:25:27.773
Do you want some punch?

01:25:28.899 --> 01:25:30.526
Yes, please.

01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:43.873
Carrie?

01:25:44.040 --> 01:25:47.334
Hi, Miss Desjarden.
You look very pretty.

01:25:47.501 --> 01:25:50.671
Thank you. You look...

01:25:52.089 --> 01:25:53.549
You look amazing.

01:25:55.551 --> 01:25:57.636
That's very nice of you.

01:25:57.803 --> 01:25:59.930
I know it's not true,
but thank you.

01:26:00.097 --> 01:26:01.418
For God's sake,
take a compliment.

01:26:01.557 --> 01:26:03.309
I wouldn't say it
if I didn't mean it.

01:26:03.517 --> 01:26:04.602
Thank you.

01:26:04.769 --> 01:26:06.604
Do you mind if I sit down?

01:26:06.979 --> 01:26:08.564
My feet are killing me.

01:26:09.857 --> 01:26:11.525
I remember my prom.

01:26:11.692 --> 01:26:13.319
My date brought a toy gun

01:26:13.527 --> 01:26:15.738
so he could pose like James Bond
for the picture.

01:26:17.656 --> 01:26:18.908
He sounds like fun.

01:26:19.075 --> 01:26:22.036
Yeah.
They arrested him.

01:26:22.244 --> 01:26:24.538
I didn't have
anybody to dance with.

01:26:24.747 --> 01:26:27.541
I spent the entire night alone
until my father picked me up.

01:26:28.584 --> 01:26:29.543
I'm sorry.

01:26:29.752 --> 01:26:31.378
It's just a dance.

01:26:32.421 --> 01:26:36.300
I mean, it's special and all,
but it's not that special.

01:26:37.885 --> 01:26:40.054
I know.
I mean, that thing's skimpy.

01:26:42.556 --> 01:26:44.809
So, you excited
about graduation?

01:26:47.603 --> 01:26:48.979
I don't know.

01:26:49.730 --> 01:26:51.649
I couldn't wait to graduate.

01:26:52.817 --> 01:26:53.901
Really?

01:26:54.068 --> 01:26:55.611
Oh, yeah.
I hated high school.

01:26:55.778 --> 01:26:59.573
Oh, God.
I do, too.

01:26:59.740 --> 01:27:01.220
I know you're
not supposed to say that

01:27:01.325 --> 01:27:02.827
but I do,
I hate it so much.

01:27:02.993 --> 01:27:05.913
Preaching to the choir.
No offense.

01:27:07.081 --> 01:27:10.167
Just remember, nothing
that happens up until now

01:27:10.334 --> 01:27:13.129
matters after graduation.
Nothing.

01:27:13.337 --> 01:27:17.174
Except, you know,
like studying and good grades.

01:27:17.341 --> 01:27:20.845
You take what you want
and you leave the rest behind.

01:27:21.011 --> 01:27:22.772
You never even have to see
these people again

01:27:22.930 --> 01:27:24.306
if you don't want to.

01:27:24.473 --> 01:27:26.308
- I don't?
- No.

01:27:26.475 --> 01:27:28.853
But I highly recommend
the ten-year reunion.

01:27:29.019 --> 01:27:31.272
- Why?
- Everybody's different.

01:27:31.438 --> 01:27:32.773
People will say...

01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:34.900
"Oh, my God. So and so
hasn't changed at all"

01:27:35.067 --> 01:27:36.527
but they're lying.

01:27:36.735 --> 01:27:39.655
Everybody changes,
and not always for the better.

01:27:40.739 --> 01:27:43.868
Like those girls over there.

01:27:44.034 --> 01:27:46.078
Right now,
they're at their peak.

01:27:46.245 --> 01:27:49.874
They'll never be more pretty
or more popular.

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:52.835
And in ten years,
they'll be fat.

01:27:53.043 --> 01:27:55.504
And the fat girls,
some of them'll be thin.

01:27:55.671 --> 01:27:58.215
And the cute boys
will be bald

01:27:58.424 --> 01:28:01.343
and the jocks
will have beer bellies.

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:03.554
It's fantastic.

01:28:03.721 --> 01:28:05.598
- Really?
- I swear to God.

01:28:07.016 --> 01:28:09.476
And the ones
who were miserable...

01:28:09.643 --> 01:28:11.395
turn out just fine.

01:28:13.230 --> 01:28:14.690
They do.

01:28:15.399 --> 01:28:16.942
So enjoy yourself.

01:28:17.359 --> 01:28:19.111
Try not to take it
too seriously.

01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:21.864
It'll be over
before you know it.

01:28:22.031 --> 01:28:23.658
Hey, Miss D.

01:28:23.866 --> 01:28:25.492
Hey, Tommy.
Don't you look nice?

01:28:25.659 --> 01:28:26.785
Thanks.

01:28:26.994 --> 01:28:28.287
Can I talk to you
for a second?

01:28:28.495 --> 01:28:29.496
Sure.

01:28:39.048 --> 01:28:40.633
Having fun?

01:28:41.342 --> 01:28:43.260
- Yeah.
- Good.

01:28:43.886 --> 01:28:45.763
I just thought
you should know...

01:28:45.971 --> 01:28:49.225
if you show Carrie anything less
than the time of her life...

01:28:49.934 --> 01:28:52.770
I'll see to it personally
you're expelled.

01:28:55.272 --> 01:28:56.649
Do you understand
the words

01:28:56.857 --> 01:28:58.567
that just came out
of my mouth?

01:28:59.693 --> 01:29:00.986
Yes.

01:29:03.989 --> 01:29:05.574
Then go dance with her.

01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:09.703
Stick to the slow songs.

01:29:09.912 --> 01:29:11.997
She'll look stupid
dancing to anything fast.

01:29:22.299 --> 01:29:23.801
Everything OK?

01:29:24.301 --> 01:29:25.594
Yeah.

01:29:30.307 --> 01:29:31.850
- So do you want to dance?
- No.

01:29:36.272 --> 01:29:37.564
Do you?

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:40.109
Not really.

01:29:46.031 --> 01:29:48.951
But it is our senior prom.

01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.579
I can't dance.

01:29:52.788 --> 01:29:55.374
It's a slow song,
so all we have to do

01:29:55.541 --> 01:29:59.586
is stand close to each other
and shift our weight

01:29:59.795 --> 01:30:02.923
from foot to foot like
everybody else is doing.

01:30:08.637 --> 01:30:10.347
It requires no skill.

01:30:12.850 --> 01:30:14.143
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:30:21.275 --> 01:30:22.359
Here.

01:30:24.445 --> 01:30:26.071
Put your hand here.

01:30:27.281 --> 01:30:28.407
And then...

01:30:38.709 --> 01:30:40.878
See?
Nothing to it.

01:30:54.516 --> 01:30:56.101
Tommy?

01:30:56.310 --> 01:30:57.728
Yeah?

01:31:00.356 --> 01:31:01.607
Thank you.

01:31:02.566 --> 01:31:03.859
For what?

01:31:05.611 --> 01:31:06.820
For everything.

01:31:06.987 --> 01:31:08.655
For taking me to the prom...

01:31:08.822 --> 01:31:10.324
for being so nice to me.

01:31:13.535 --> 01:31:18.207
I know that you don't
like me like that...

01:31:18.374 --> 01:31:19.625
but...

01:31:21.752 --> 01:31:25.005
I'm glad I got to be
your date tonight.

01:31:27.424 --> 01:31:28.759
Me, too.

01:32:14.012 --> 01:32:15.806
I think I'm gonna let
you pull the rope.

01:32:41.582 --> 01:32:43.292
Your attention, please.

01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:55.053
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention?

01:32:57.264 --> 01:32:58.682
Shut up!

01:33:03.061 --> 01:33:04.855
Please take your seats.

01:33:05.063 --> 01:33:07.774
It's time to vote
for king and queen.

01:33:17.242 --> 01:33:18.785
Tommy, we're on here.

01:33:18.994 --> 01:33:21.288
Yeah. I saw that.

01:33:22.789 --> 01:33:25.542
- Can we decline?
- Hell, no.

01:33:25.709 --> 01:33:27.503
If you win,
all you do is sit up there

01:33:27.669 --> 01:33:30.923
for the school song,
wave some scepter around

01:33:31.089 --> 01:33:34.051
and look like a jackass.

01:33:34.968 --> 01:33:37.429
Then you get your picture
taken for the yearbook...

01:33:37.596 --> 01:33:41.308
so everyone can see
you look like a jackass.

01:33:41.475 --> 01:33:43.810
Oh, yeah, and then
you get to lead a dance.

01:33:44.353 --> 01:33:45.312
Who do we vote for?

01:33:45.521 --> 01:33:47.272
Ourselves, duh.

01:33:48.815 --> 01:33:50.984
Isn't that like voting
for Ralph Nader?

01:33:51.151 --> 01:33:52.569
Who?

01:33:53.028 --> 01:33:54.738
Well, I'm voting for you.

01:33:55.864 --> 01:33:58.575
False modesty sucks.

01:34:03.330 --> 01:34:04.998
Ballots, please.

01:34:14.216 --> 01:34:15.551
Good luck!

01:34:22.015 --> 01:34:25.143
We found these in the dumpster
behind what's left of the gym.

01:34:26.979 --> 01:34:29.231
I can't believe
you touched those.

01:34:29.439 --> 01:34:31.066
They're probably
swimming with disease.

01:34:31.275 --> 01:34:32.442
You recognize them?

01:34:32.776 --> 01:34:35.362
They're prom ballots.
I'm the one that Xeroxed them.

01:34:35.571 --> 01:34:38.323
According to these, Frank
and Jessica were elected

01:34:38.532 --> 01:34:40.117
king and queen of the prom.

01:34:41.743 --> 01:34:43.370
I counted those ballots myself.

01:34:43.579 --> 01:34:45.205
Mr. Morton checked my work.

01:34:45.414 --> 01:34:47.749
Tommy and Carrie
won fair and square.

01:34:47.916 --> 01:34:51.378
- I'm guessing by a landslide.
- Yeah.

01:34:51.545 --> 01:34:52.705
That doesn't seem odd to you?

01:34:53.797 --> 01:34:56.008
I just figured
they were pity votes.

01:34:57.509 --> 01:34:59.011
They're not pity votes, Norma.

01:34:59.678 --> 01:35:01.388
Somebody switched the ballots.

01:35:09.396 --> 01:35:12.691
It's time to announce
our elected royalty.

01:35:19.031 --> 01:35:20.324
We have a chance.

01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:28.248
Tommy Ross and Carrie White!

01:36:13.251 --> 01:36:14.836
Come on up, you guys-

01:36:18.340 --> 01:36:21.134
You look so beautiful.

01:36:22.427 --> 01:36:23.512
Congratulations.

01:36:31.812 --> 01:36:33.647
Oh, my God.
It's working.

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:37.002
Come on, take a seat.

01:37:38.211 --> 01:37:42.007
Just sit there.
Sit. Great. OK.

01:38:06.656 --> 01:38:08.241
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:38:08.408 --> 01:38:11.495
your king and queen
of senior prom!

01:38:18.877 --> 01:38:20.420
They're playing the school song.

01:38:31.848 --> 01:38:33.308
Pull it now.

01:38:41.566 --> 01:38:43.735
- Pull it now.
- Shut up.

01:38:54.037 --> 01:38:55.330
Do it.

01:39:10.637 --> 01:39:11.805
I knew it.

01:39:12.514 --> 01:39:14.474
I knew you were
going to chicken out.

01:39:20.146 --> 01:39:21.731
I'm not pulling it for you.

01:39:22.399 --> 01:39:23.900
This is your thing.

01:39:24.651 --> 01:39:27.737
That bucket can sit up there
till graduation for all I care.

01:39:30.532 --> 01:39:32.158
Your Highnesses...

01:39:32.325 --> 01:39:35.328
the court requests
that you lead them in dance.

01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:16.429
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:41:16.638 --> 01:41:19.349
your king and queen
of senior prom!

01:43:43.576 --> 01:43:46.370
Pig, Pig, Pig, soo-ey!

01:43:55.547 --> 01:43:58.091
Pig, Pig, Pig!

01:44:07.350 --> 01:44:09.853
Pig, Pig, Pig!

01:44:23.283 --> 01:44:24.909
Carrie?

01:44:27.245 --> 01:44:30.081
Carrie, look at me.

01:45:10.580 --> 01:45:11.915
He's not breathing!

01:45:12.081 --> 01:45:15.376
I can barely feel his pulse.
We gotta get him to a doctor.

01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:59.963
It'll be all right.
Just stay here!

01:46:00.129 --> 01:46:01.631
Don't go away!
I'll be right back!

01:46:07.262 --> 01:46:09.389
Everybody, try to stay calm!

01:46:09.555 --> 01:46:11.036
Go to the exits
in an orderly fashion!

01:46:11.224 --> 01:46:13.601
Don't panic! Don't go in...

01:46:21.651 --> 01:46:22.777
Help!

01:46:23.236 --> 01:46:24.529
Get out of the way!

01:46:40.169 --> 01:46:41.421
Come on, Tommy!

01:46:45.717 --> 01:46:47.260
Get him up!
Just get him up!

01:46:57.979 --> 01:46:59.397
Get him out of here!

01:47:46.402 --> 01:47:48.946
Help me!
Somebody!

01:48:11.677 --> 01:48:13.679
Listen to me, kids!
Get away from the doors!

01:48:13.846 --> 01:48:15.139
Move into
the center of the gym!

01:48:15.348 --> 01:48:17.016
They will get the doors open!

01:48:17.809 --> 01:48:20.436
Just don't panic!
Listen to me!

01:48:26.776 --> 01:48:28.361
Norma!
Norma!

01:48:28.528 --> 01:48:31.989
Norma! Look at me!
You come with me, OK?

01:48:32.198 --> 01:48:33.282
Everybody come with me!

01:48:38.830 --> 01:48:40.456
- Come on!
- Oh, my God!

01:48:41.040 --> 01:48:42.625
Come on!

01:48:58.057 --> 01:49:00.810
Get me out! Get me out!
I don't want to die!

01:49:00.977 --> 01:49:05.189
Help me!
Help me!

01:49:05.398 --> 01:49:08.025
Get me the chair!
Get me the chair!

01:49:10.945 --> 01:49:13.948
Come on! Help me!
Help me!

01:49:19.287 --> 01:49:21.330
Pull it! Pull it!
Come on! Come on!

01:49:24.542 --> 01:49:25.960
Help me!

01:49:33.885 --> 01:49:37.180
Norma, get in! Go!

01:49:44.145 --> 01:49:45.938
Carrie!

01:49:54.447 --> 01:49:57.116
Everybody get off the floor!

01:49:57.283 --> 01:50:00.244
Hurry! Hurry!
Get off the floor!

01:51:31.961 --> 01:51:34.922
When did you first realize
that something was wrong?

01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:37.758
When I heard the sirens.

01:52:10.166 --> 01:52:12.668
Fuel tanks down at the school
just went up.

01:52:12.835 --> 01:52:14.462
Gymnasium is gone.

01:52:14.629 --> 01:52:15.749
What happened at the school?

01:52:15.838 --> 01:52:17.438
Go home.
There's nothing you can do here.

01:52:18.007 --> 01:52:19.383
Come on! Go!

01:52:19.759 --> 01:52:21.302
People, move back!

01:53:34.083 --> 01:53:35.835
Carrie?

01:53:38.838 --> 01:53:41.132
Go! Go!

01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:47.805
Carrie!

01:54:05.197 --> 01:54:08.075
Hey! Dude!
Open up!

01:54:11.454 --> 01:54:12.913
What's your problem, man?

01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:14.874
Chamberlain's burning up, man!

01:54:15.541 --> 01:54:17.710
Whole damn town.
School's gutted.

01:54:17.918 --> 01:54:19.128
What?

01:54:19.295 --> 01:54:20.671
They said people
at the prom were trapped.

01:54:20.838 --> 01:54:24.175
Only like 11 of them got out.
Everybody else was cooked.

01:54:27.261 --> 01:54:28.429
Dude...

01:54:29.013 --> 01:54:33.225
The ones that got out
told the police

01:54:33.434 --> 01:54:36.353
something about a prank.

01:54:46.030 --> 01:54:47.531
Go home.

01:54:48.699 --> 01:54:50.242
Don't talk to anybody.

01:54:54.413 --> 01:54:56.040
What are we going to do?

01:54:58.876 --> 01:55:01.670
We're going into town
and we're gonna watch the fires.

01:56:57.786 --> 01:56:59.705
Who is that?

01:57:04.084 --> 01:57:05.878
What are you doing?

01:57:06.503 --> 01:57:08.756
Billy! Stop!
Stop!

02:00:10.854 --> 02:00:12.231
Mama?

02:00:15.359 --> 02:00:17.528
What happened? I don't...

02:00:20.906 --> 02:00:21.907
The Lord says,

02:00:22.116 --> 02:00:26.245
"Thou shalt not suffer
a witch to live."

02:00:26.411 --> 02:00:28.789
I'm not a witch, Mama.

02:00:33.752 --> 02:00:36.463
Please tell me what happened!

02:00:38.549 --> 02:00:40.509
You were weak, Carrie.

02:00:44.638 --> 02:00:47.182
I told you
your sin would find you.

02:00:50.310 --> 02:00:51.895
'III

02:00:52.771 --> 02:00:54.857
I can't remem...

02:00:55.983 --> 02:00:57.985
remember.

02:01:03.490 --> 02:01:05.033
Help me.

02:01:08.787 --> 02:01:10.247
Let's Pray-

02:01:12.916 --> 02:01:14.209
Say it with me.

02:01:17.254 --> 02:01:19.548
Now I lay me down to sleep...

02:01:20.883 --> 02:01:24.052
Now I lay me down to sleep...

02:01:25.304 --> 02:01:26.889
I pray the Lord...

02:01:28.974 --> 02:01:32.269
I pray the Lord...

02:01:32.477 --> 02:01:34.813
my soul to keep.

02:01:43.238 --> 02:01:45.324
If I should die...

02:01:45.490 --> 02:01:47.409
before I wake...

02:01:49.494 --> 02:01:51.079
I pray the Lord...

02:01:53.707 --> 02:01:55.876
my soul to take.

02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:08.597
The Lord...

02:02:11.016 --> 02:02:12.976
The Lord is not mocked.

02:03:22.671 --> 02:03:25.007
When was the last time
you saw Carrie White alive?

02:03:26.466 --> 02:03:29.094
At school, before the prom.

02:03:30.304 --> 02:03:32.764
You told Sheriff Doyle
you saw her after the prom.

02:03:34.266 --> 02:03:35.642
Right before
the Critter King blew.

02:03:35.809 --> 02:03:37.894
It was dark.
I saw a girl in a dress.

02:03:39.187 --> 02:03:40.605
You said you saw Carrie White.

02:03:40.814 --> 02:03:41.940
I was wrong.

02:03:43.817 --> 02:03:45.986
What's it matter anyway?
Carrie's dead.

02:03:46.194 --> 02:03:48.071
It matters because
we still haven't figured out

02:03:48.238 --> 02:03:49.489
what happened on prom night.

02:03:49.948 --> 02:03:52.242
And it also matters
because we still haven't

02:03:52.451 --> 02:03:53.994
identified Carrie White's body.

02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:29.571
Oh, God.

02:04:33.158 --> 02:04:36.620
OK. Head back.
Open...

02:04:45.796 --> 02:04:47.339
Come on.

02:04:53.387 --> 02:04:54.513
OK.

02:05:32.384 --> 02:05:35.095
OK.
You have to go.

02:05:35.262 --> 02:05:39.224
OK. Here.
OK?

02:05:39.766 --> 02:05:41.226
What happened?

02:05:42.686 --> 02:05:46.606
What happened?
What did I do?

02:05:47.983 --> 02:05:50.694
You have to go, OK?

02:05:51.236 --> 02:05:52.988
Come on.

02:05:54.030 --> 02:05:56.992
You ever see something
you can't explain?

02:05:57.159 --> 02:05:59.995
I'm not talking about
a strange light in the sky

02:06:00.203 --> 02:06:02.456
or Jesus' face on a tortilla.

02:06:03.331 --> 02:06:06.334
I'm talking about something
that's not supposed to happen.

02:06:06.918 --> 02:06:09.171
Like, in reality.

02:06:10.172 --> 02:06:12.215
You mean, like a miracle?

02:06:14.968 --> 02:06:16.636
Something else.

02:06:18.221 --> 02:06:20.849
Did you ever think the reason
that you can't explain

02:06:21.016 --> 02:06:23.059
what happened on prom night
is because...

02:06:23.268 --> 02:06:26.188
what happened wasn't natural?

02:06:30.066 --> 02:06:33.528
Two weeks ago,
I saw a steel desk

02:06:33.737 --> 02:06:36.698
move across the floor
without anyone touching it.

02:06:37.324 --> 02:06:40.660
Five inches.
I measured.

02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:44.706
Carrie White was in the room
when it happened.

02:06:45.582 --> 02:06:49.169
234 people died,
and you're trying to sell me

02:06:49.336 --> 02:06:51.338
on some
"Weekly World News" headline?

02:06:51.505 --> 02:06:54.341
I don't need you to tell me
how many people died.

02:06:54.508 --> 02:06:57.719
Half of them were kids
I saw every day.

02:06:57.886 --> 02:07:01.348
I am truly sorry for your loss,
Miss Desjarden. I am.

02:07:01.890 --> 02:07:03.558
But that doesn't
change the fact

02:07:03.767 --> 02:07:05.268
that someone's
still unaccounted for.

02:07:05.977 --> 02:07:08.438
This girl is one of
eight missing persons,

02:07:08.647 --> 02:07:11.233
but the problem is,
we only got seven bodies.

02:07:12.859 --> 02:07:15.278
Now, you're
implying what, exactly?

02:07:15.862 --> 02:07:17.822
I'm not implying anything.

02:07:18.865 --> 02:07:21.034
I'm just giving you the facts.

02:07:25.956 --> 02:07:28.208
What did you see on prom night?

02:07:28.375 --> 02:07:31.711
I was hanging from an air vent,
pissing my pants,

02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:33.922
trying not to get electrocuted.

02:07:34.089 --> 02:07:35.799
I didn't see anything.

02:07:35.966 --> 02:07:38.343
Might as well tell you
it was poltergeists.

02:07:38.510 --> 02:07:40.762
- But you don't believe that, right?
- No.

02:07:40.971 --> 02:07:42.514
You believe
it was Carrie White.

02:08:11.501 --> 02:08:13.420
It wasn't your fault.

02:08:17.424 --> 02:08:19.467
It wasn't all your fault.

02:08:23.597 --> 02:08:25.265
We shouldn't be here.

02:08:26.057 --> 02:08:27.225
People thinking you're dead

02:08:27.392 --> 02:08:29.603
is sort of contingent
on nobody seeing you alive.

02:08:32.355 --> 02:08:33.773
Where am I going to go?

02:08:37.110 --> 02:08:38.653
I don't know.

02:08:41.281 --> 02:08:43.074
Somewhere
where they don't know you.

02:08:49.205 --> 02:08:51.082
I'll drive you
as far as Florida.

02:08:52.375 --> 02:08:53.960
Then I have to come back.

02:09:48.973 --> 02:09:50.850
Sin never dies.

02:09:56.481 --> 02:09:58.441
Bad dream?

02:10:09.869 --> 02:10:11.538
Are you OK?

02:10:19.462 --> 02:10:21.005
Do you want me to pull over?

02:10:23.341 --> 02:10:24.592
No.

02:10:25.305 --> 02:10:31.427
