(door creaks)

04:14.759 --> 04:17.661
(slow piano music)

04:29.103 --> 04:32.379
- You go ahead, I'll
go and get Seth.

04:50.828 --> 04:54.401
(slow piano music continues)

05:33.838 --> 05:35.970
Seth seems to have
settled in already.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.078
It's only a temporary situation.

05:46.851 --> 05:51.117
If it's difficult for you
to live here, we could-

05:51.152 --> 05:53.757
- Put it on the market, I know.

05:53.792 --> 05:54.626
- Exactly.

05:57.862 --> 06:00.533
(Richard laughs)

06:04.638 --> 06:07.771
(slow orchestral music)

06:20.918 --> 06:23.556
(Alyson moans)

06:28.596 --> 06:29.430
Hey.

06:33.227 --> 06:38.439
It's nothing, relax.
(Alyson trembles)

06:40.234 --> 06:41.068
Breathe,

06:43.006 --> 06:44.511
relax and breathe.

06:47.912 --> 06:49.208
Relax and breathe.

06:52.785 --> 06:53.850
That's right,

06:55.557 --> 06:56.589
relax and breathe.

06:59.627 --> 07:02.892
- You need to breathe,
to take a deep breath.

07:02.927 --> 07:04.058
It'll help you.

07:04.093 --> 07:05.697
- I'm scared.

07:05.732 --> 07:08.535
- There's no need to be,
it's only a bad dream.

07:08.570 --> 07:12.000
We all have dreams, I
dream, Mommy dreams.

07:12.035 --> 07:14.068
- And do you have
bad dreams, too?

07:14.103 --> 07:18.545
- Sometimes, but then I wake
up and it all disappears,

07:18.580 --> 07:21.042
and you've always got
Mr. Bear with you.

07:21.077 --> 07:22.615
Come on, try to get some sleep.

07:25.015 --> 07:25.647
- [Alyson] No.

07:27.622 --> 07:29.248
- You want me to leave it on?

07:29.283 --> 07:31.558
Okay, we'll leave it.

07:34.563 --> 07:35.188
Good night.

07:44.199 --> 07:47.508
(slow ominous music)

08:18.607 --> 08:21.234
(Alyson trembles)

08:24.778 --> 08:27.174
(Alyson moans)

08:31.180 --> 08:34.654
(coffee maker whines)

08:34.689 --> 08:35.722
- [Reporter] Kena
Saunders, the girl

08:35.757 --> 08:37.624
who disappeared three
years ago, has been found

08:37.659 --> 08:39.219
at the bottom of a lake,
thanks to the intervention

08:39.254 --> 08:41.628
of the psychic, David Owen.

08:41.663 --> 08:44.158
According to reports, on the
morning of September 10th,

08:44.193 --> 08:46.633
Mr. Owen led a group of scuba
divers to the lake shore,

08:46.668 --> 08:48.294
telling them, "She's here."

08:48.329 --> 08:50.329
A robot with a camera
was then submerged,

08:50.364 --> 08:51.836
and at the bottom of the-

08:51.871 --> 08:52.837
- May I?

08:52.872 --> 08:54.036
- Thanks.
- At the depth

08:54.071 --> 08:55.675
of over 100 meters,
her car was found.

08:55.710 --> 08:57.369
The license plate
matched, leaving no doubt.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.107
The question that
must now be asked is,

08:59.142 --> 09:00.944
how did Mr. Owen find her?

09:00.979 --> 09:01.879
Here's what the-

09:01.914 --> 09:04.211
- There you go, you'll be late.

09:04.246 --> 09:06.653
- Not if I take this with me.

09:06.688 --> 09:10.052
I'll be home late tonight,
we have a work dinner, so-

09:12.859 --> 09:13.660
- Have a nice day.

09:13.695 --> 09:15.761
- Okay. (laughs)

09:15.796 --> 09:17.323
- [Reporter] Who was
pleasantly impressed

09:17.358 --> 09:21.360
by the man's abilities,
so seer or charlatan?

09:21.395 --> 09:25.001
(slow piano music)

09:25.036 --> 09:27.366
(vacuum roars)

09:33.682 --> 09:37.211
(slow piano music continues)

10:02.172 --> 10:04.777
(Alyson sighs)

10:14.822 --> 10:17.383
(water trickles)

10:23.831 --> 10:26.733
(slow ominous music)

10:44.379 --> 10:48.282
(slow ominous music continues)

10:53.993 --> 10:56.323
(Seth cries)

10:57.458 --> 10:59.898
- Hey, sweetie, Mommy's here.

11:03.332 --> 11:05.167
Don't cry, shh, shh, shh.

11:08.942 --> 11:12.845
(slow ominous music continues)

11:39.401 --> 11:42.435
- You can't play in here,
especially with Mommy's stuff,

11:42.470 --> 11:44.041
and I'll need that ball of yarn.

11:57.485 --> 12:00.453
(slow ominous music)

12:05.559 --> 12:06.833
- Bye, darling.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.071
Well, it's not that different.

12:14.106 --> 12:15.534
- [Alyson] Oh, really?

12:15.569 --> 12:19.043
- Sure, for me, it's just
a change of location.

12:19.078 --> 12:20.374
- Uh, what about
your old clients?

12:20.409 --> 12:22.013
- They're still my clients.

12:22.048 --> 12:23.377
I'll continue to
manage their policies.

12:23.412 --> 12:24.246
- Good.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.415
So what was that big
news you mentioned?

12:37.426 --> 12:39.063
What does this mean?

12:39.098 --> 12:40.262
- It's a first class ticket.

12:42.035 --> 12:43.562
- I can see that.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.432
- Obviously it's
something positive.

12:46.435 --> 12:48.270
- Okay, but what does it mean?

12:50.142 --> 12:53.242
- I'll be going away for a few
days for a training course.

12:53.277 --> 12:54.947
So do you realize
what this means?

12:56.313 --> 12:58.577
It means that the company
is investing in me,

13:00.449 --> 13:04.418
preparing me for something
really important. (laughs)

13:04.453 --> 13:06.519
So what do you think?

13:06.554 --> 13:07.353
- I'm happy for you.

13:09.062 --> 13:11.359
- Oh, come on,
Alyson, what's wrong?

13:11.394 --> 13:12.228
- Nothing.

13:14.463 --> 13:15.935
- You're such a bad liar.

13:21.008 --> 13:21.842
A toast?

13:27.113 --> 13:29.641
- My father just
committed suicide.

13:29.676 --> 13:32.985
We moved to this house with
all our things still to be in-

13:33.020 --> 13:35.284
- Alyson, I understand you.

13:36.518 --> 13:38.122
- You don't understand anything.

13:38.157 --> 13:41.422
- Life has a cost,
our child has a cost,

13:41.457 --> 13:43.963
and this is something big.

13:43.998 --> 13:46.427
- Well, moving to this house
is something big for me,

13:46.462 --> 13:49.067
a huge sacrifice.

13:49.102 --> 13:52.268
The least you could do was
at least stay by my side.

13:52.303 --> 13:54.468
- That's exactly
what I'm going to do,

13:54.503 --> 13:56.173
and I'll do it as
soon as I come back.

13:57.341 --> 13:59.077
Try to think about us.

13:59.112 --> 14:00.441
- That's exactly what I'm doing.

14:05.217 --> 14:07.987
(Richard scoffs)

14:08.022 --> 14:10.154
Will she be coming with you?

14:12.620 --> 14:14.928
Your colleague, will
she be coming with you?

14:17.064 --> 14:18.426
- What's that supposed to mean?

14:20.232 --> 14:23.530
- The same plane, a seat
next to you, the same hotel?

14:25.138 --> 14:26.335
Will you be sharing
a room, as well?

14:26.370 --> 14:28.205
- I knew you would have
brought this up again.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.009
- Perhaps that's
because you hurt me.

14:30.044 --> 14:32.506
Perhaps that's because you
didn't realize how I felt.

14:32.541 --> 14:34.607
- Come on, five years.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.544
It was five years ago.

14:41.649 --> 14:44.518
We said we wouldn't have
spoken about it again

14:44.553 --> 14:45.926
because we had got over it.

14:47.061 --> 14:49.226
We would have carried
on with our lives,

14:49.261 --> 14:52.559
but you are still there,
stuck in the past.

14:52.594 --> 14:53.967
- Well, you could have refused.

14:54.002 --> 14:56.629
- Refused what,
our biggest chance

14:56.664 --> 14:58.697
to finally sort things
out once and for all?

14:58.732 --> 15:01.469
- This wasn't the moment to
go, Richard, and you know it.

15:01.504 --> 15:03.075
- And you think
if I had said no,

15:03.110 --> 15:05.110
my boss would have offered
me the chance again

15:05.145 --> 15:07.574
in the future, do you
really think that?

15:07.609 --> 15:11.083
- Well, you could have
at least spoken with him,

15:11.118 --> 15:14.185
explained to him the
situation, ask him to postpone.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.552
But I bet you didn't
even try, did you?

15:23.691 --> 15:25.526
That's what I thought.

15:25.561 --> 15:28.661
(slow ominous music)

15:45.416 --> 15:47.647
(Seth coos)

15:47.682 --> 15:50.419
(water trickles)

15:53.061 --> 15:55.358
(toy rattles)

16:04.336 --> 16:08.041
(slow ominous music continues)

16:09.374 --> 16:12.078
(toy rattles)

16:25.357 --> 16:27.225
(lock rattles)

16:27.260 --> 16:29.491
(slow music)

16:50.514 --> 16:54.054
(slow orchestral music)

16:59.325 --> 17:03.426
- Mommy's not well, she's ill.

17:03.461 --> 17:07.463
She's very ill, but
she'll get better soon.

17:07.498 --> 17:09.135
- When?

17:09.170 --> 17:10.829
- It's gonna take a
long time, princess,

17:10.864 --> 17:13.700
but I promise you,
she will get better.

17:15.209 --> 17:17.671
- To regain victory,
regain victory over evil

17:17.706 --> 17:19.310
that may surpass all-

17:19.345 --> 17:21.774
- That's daddy's friend,
he's come to visit us,

17:21.809 --> 17:24.546
and he's going to help Mommy.

17:24.581 --> 17:27.153
And two more friends
are coming, too,

17:27.188 --> 17:31.124
all the way from America,
and they love children.

17:34.228 --> 17:35.392
Let me tell you a secret.

17:36.923 --> 17:40.562
They have a huge house
with lots of toys,

17:40.597 --> 17:43.730
and I've been there and
had a great time playing

17:43.765 --> 17:47.470
with all of them, so
you want to see it?

17:48.737 --> 17:50.473
Are you sure?

17:50.508 --> 17:54.213
It's fantastic, and you can
take Mr. Bear with you, too.

17:55.612 --> 17:59.581
So do you want to go with
them, you and Mr. Bear,

17:59.616 --> 18:01.319
just until Mommy
gets better again?

18:04.621 --> 18:06.885
You'll have fun, you'll see.

18:08.625 --> 18:11.164
(doorbell rings)

18:11.199 --> 18:11.890
That must be them now.

18:15.566 --> 18:18.435
(slow ominous music)

18:28.480 --> 18:31.217
- Alyson, if I don't
get on that plane,

18:31.252 --> 18:32.845
they will send someone
else in my place,

18:34.486 --> 18:36.915
and that will be bad news
for the both of us. (sighs)

18:39.689 --> 18:40.523
Look at me.

18:44.628 --> 18:45.792
Everything will be fine.

18:47.367 --> 18:49.301
You and Seth will be
fine and I'll be back

18:49.336 --> 18:50.632
before you even know I'm gone.

18:53.340 --> 18:57.243
(slow ominous music continues)

19:20.994 --> 19:26.206
(dog barks)
(insects whirring)

19:27.374 --> 19:30.309
(slow ominous music)

20:08.481 --> 20:11.680
(circuit breaker clicks)

21:01.468 --> 21:04.370
(slow ominous music)

21:09.575 --> 21:10.673
(baby monitor crackles)

21:10.708 --> 21:12.939
(Seth cries)

21:25.118 --> 21:28.889
- [Mary] Stop crying,
I beg you, stop!

21:28.924 --> 21:33.091
(Alyson trembles)
(Seth cries)

21:33.126 --> 21:36.336
Your breath, your
breath is so warm.

21:37.801 --> 21:38.767
Now be quiet.

21:39.902 --> 21:43.409
(Alyson trembles)

21:43.444 --> 21:45.642
Silence!
(Seth cries)

21:47.140 --> 21:51.912
(Alyson trembles)
(slow ominous music)

21:54.488 --> 21:56.114
(phone vibrates)

21:56.149 --> 21:58.490
- [Richard] Alyson,
what's wrong?

21:58.525 --> 21:59.920
- [Alyson] She wanted
to take him away from me

21:59.955 --> 22:01.361
and it was terrible-
- She?

22:02.430 --> 22:03.495
Who are you talking about?

22:04.630 --> 22:05.497
What's happening?

22:06.665 --> 22:07.829
- [Alyson] I could
feel her eyes on me.

22:07.864 --> 22:09.094
- Are you both okay?

22:09.129 --> 22:10.964
- [Alyson] I woke
up, I couldn't move.

22:10.999 --> 22:13.439
- You and Seth, are you okay?

22:13.474 --> 22:17.135
- Yes, Seth is fine, he's
here with me. (cries)

22:20.481 --> 22:21.909
It felt so real, Richard.

22:24.012 --> 22:25.979
She wanted to hurt us.

22:26.014 --> 22:27.486
- [Richard] Who?

22:27.521 --> 22:29.081
- I don't know who,
she said she wanted

22:29.116 --> 22:32.491
to take him away from me, that
she would have shut him up.

22:32.526 --> 22:34.823
- [Richard] Alyson, now
you need to calm down.

22:34.858 --> 22:36.528
It was a hallucination,

22:36.563 --> 22:38.156
one of your nighttime
hallucinations.

22:38.191 --> 22:40.026
- No, this time
it was different.

22:40.061 --> 22:41.698
It wasn't like the others.

22:41.733 --> 22:44.602
- Take a deep breath
and calm down, please.

22:44.637 --> 22:46.439
- [Alyson] I'm sorry, I
shouldn't have called you.

22:46.474 --> 22:47.836
- No, you did the right thing.

22:48.971 --> 22:50.641
- [Alyson] Richard?

22:50.676 --> 22:52.170
- What?

22:52.205 --> 22:54.172
- [Alyson] When are
you coming back?

22:54.207 --> 22:55.415
- I'll be back soon.

22:57.584 --> 22:58.946
Now you need to try to relax.

23:00.983 --> 23:02.521
Are you taking your medication?

23:05.053 --> 23:05.887
Alyson?

23:08.122 --> 23:09.825
- I'm listening.

23:09.860 --> 23:11.530
- [Richard] Are you
taking your medication?

23:13.061 --> 23:14.533
- No, I-

23:14.568 --> 23:16.601
- [Richard] Take it
and go back to bed.

23:16.636 --> 23:18.966
Take Seth with you if
it makes you better,

23:19.001 --> 23:20.638
but you need to get
some rest, okay?

23:21.971 --> 23:22.805
- Okay.

23:25.711 --> 23:26.875
Richard?

23:26.910 --> 23:27.810
- [Richard] What?

23:29.913 --> 23:30.846
- Come back soon.

23:32.179 --> 23:33.585
- [Richard] Okay.

23:34.984 --> 23:36.214
- Good night, Richard.

23:36.249 --> 23:37.215
- [Richard] Good night.

23:39.087 --> 23:42.990
(slow ominous music continues)

24:09.623 --> 24:12.118
(ceiling creaks)

24:16.960 --> 24:18.894
(slow ominous music)

24:18.929 --> 24:21.633
(door creaks)

24:28.906 --> 24:32.611
(slow ominous music continues)

25:21.992 --> 25:24.597
(Alyson gasps)

25:35.907 --> 25:38.875
(slow ominous music)

25:38.910 --> 25:40.008
(birds chirping)

25:40.043 --> 25:43.110
- [Anthony] No
peeking, I can see you.

25:43.145 --> 25:49.347
- One, two, three, four, five-

25:49.382 --> 25:51.855
- Come on, let's run and hide.

25:51.890 --> 25:53.824
- [Susan] Six, seven, eight.

25:53.859 --> 25:55.320
- [Anthony] Behind that tree.

25:55.355 --> 26:00.292
- [Susan] Nine, 10, 11, 12,

26:00.998 --> 26:01.898
13, 14, 15-

26:04.331 --> 26:05.264
- [Anthony] What
are you drawing?

26:05.299 --> 26:06.067
Let me see.

26:08.104 --> 26:11.677
Okay, so this is me
and these are stairs,

26:11.712 --> 26:14.845
but, but who's
this, is this Mommy?

26:15.947 --> 26:17.749
Why did you draw this?

26:17.784 --> 26:18.750
- That's not Mommy.

26:22.217 --> 26:26.252
- [Anthony] Susan,
Susan, is that you?

26:26.287 --> 26:30.025
(slow ominous music continues)

26:33.426 --> 26:34.260
Susan?

26:37.298 --> 26:41.740
Jesus, Susan, you
scared the life out of-

26:41.775 --> 26:45.678
- As I've told you, we need to
verify the type of disorder,

26:45.713 --> 26:47.911
whether it's psychological
or paranormal.

26:47.946 --> 26:52.014
I'm often called for cases
where a person is suffering

26:52.049 --> 26:55.215
from some sort of
dissociative disorder,

26:55.250 --> 26:58.922
psychosis, schizophrenia,
or the person is bipolar.

27:00.453 --> 27:03.289
In cases like these,
I can do very little.

27:05.128 --> 27:06.831
Have you been to see a doctor?

27:06.866 --> 27:09.130
- [Anthony] She started
therapy about a month ago

27:09.165 --> 27:11.297
and she's taking
psychiatric medication.

27:12.839 --> 27:15.367
- And have there been
any improvements?

27:15.402 --> 27:17.138
- [Anthony] No,
the situation seems

27:17.173 --> 27:18.744
to be getting worse and worse.

27:20.814 --> 27:23.881
Father Elbert, I need your help.

27:23.916 --> 27:26.444
(slow piano music)

27:28.151 --> 27:29.689
Stop it now.

27:32.122 --> 27:34.694
Susan, please, stop it, Susan.

27:37.831 --> 27:40.458
(slow ominous music)

27:45.839 --> 27:49.071
(ghostly voice whispers)

27:56.047 --> 27:58.850
(ghostly screaming)

28:05.188 --> 28:07.991
(doorbell rings)

28:09.357 --> 28:10.455
- [Father Elbert] Yes?

28:13.933 --> 28:18.463
- Um, I got your address from
the parish priest in town.

28:18.498 --> 28:20.201
- How can I help?

28:20.236 --> 28:22.038
- My name is Alyson.

28:22.073 --> 28:25.371
About 25 years ago, a man
came to ask you for help.

28:27.078 --> 28:29.111
He wanted to save his wife.

28:29.146 --> 28:32.818
That man was my father,
his name was Anthony.

28:34.250 --> 28:36.217
- I'm sorry, I don't
remember that name.

28:36.252 --> 28:38.483
- You have to remember
it, you were in my home,

28:38.518 --> 28:40.892
you met my parents.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.993
- I don't remember
anything of the sort.

28:43.028 --> 28:44.192
- I need to know.

28:44.227 --> 28:45.556
- Many years have passed.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.833
You're confusing me
for someone else.

28:47.868 --> 28:49.901
- Can you please tell
me what happened?

28:49.936 --> 28:52.068
- There's nothing to
tell, nothing to remember.

28:52.103 --> 28:53.905
Please don't waste
any more of my time.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.500
It would be better
for you to leave now.

28:55.535 --> 28:57.106
I can't help you.

28:57.141 --> 28:58.239
(door slams)

28:58.274 --> 29:00.340
- Father Elbert, I need to know.

29:02.146 --> 29:04.212
I live in the same house
with my husband and my son.

29:04.247 --> 29:06.346
I, I don't feel safe there.

29:08.251 --> 29:09.085
Please.

29:13.421 --> 29:16.026
(Alyson sighs)

29:19.526 --> 29:22.263
(birds chirping)

29:37.181 --> 29:39.511
(Seth coos)

29:56.233 --> 29:59.201
(footsteps pattering)

30:00.402 --> 30:03.304
(slow ominous music)

30:18.189 --> 30:20.959
(doorbell rings)

30:22.391 --> 30:23.588
- Good morning, Alyson.

30:30.630 --> 30:31.629
- Would you like a cup of tea?

30:31.664 --> 30:34.467
(bones cracking)

30:34.502 --> 30:36.007
Would you like a cup of tea?

30:36.042 --> 30:37.074
- No, thank you.

30:40.706 --> 30:42.915
I expect you're wondering
why I changed my mind.

30:45.546 --> 30:47.447
You have the same expression
as your father had

30:47.482 --> 30:48.415
when I met him.

30:49.990 --> 30:51.484
- In the attic the other night,

30:51.519 --> 30:54.487
I found a videotape from
my father's video camera.

30:56.095 --> 30:59.965
There were images of
him, my mother, me,

31:03.498 --> 31:04.332
and you, too.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.104
- Me?

31:07.139 --> 31:07.973
- Yeah.

31:09.339 --> 31:11.042
I guess you didn't
know about that.

31:14.212 --> 31:15.442
Why did my father come to you?

31:15.477 --> 31:17.213
- I believe you know
the answer to that.

31:19.415 --> 31:23.153
Reality is, you're
afraid of the truth.

31:24.618 --> 31:25.419
- My father-

31:25.454 --> 31:27.058
- Your father loved you.

31:29.359 --> 31:34.164
A love for a child can often
bring about painful choices.

31:36.036 --> 31:38.135
Your father thought that by
keeping you away from here,

31:38.170 --> 31:40.973
putting you up for
adoption, you'd be safe.

31:42.669 --> 31:43.976
- Safe from what?

31:46.409 --> 31:50.983
They always told me my mother
died of cancer, is that true?

31:53.680 --> 31:55.020
What happened to her?

31:56.254 --> 32:00.091
- Anthony came to me
to ask for my help.

32:00.126 --> 32:02.027
He was convinced that there was

32:03.756 --> 32:07.428
an entity harboring in his wife.

32:11.566 --> 32:13.038
He was right.

32:13.073 --> 32:14.402
(slow dramatic music)

32:14.437 --> 32:16.734
(Susan pants)

32:18.672 --> 32:22.674
(slow dramatic music continues)

32:41.266 --> 32:45.433
You who represent
the salvation of man,

32:45.468 --> 32:49.140
listen to the voices of your
apostles, Peter and Paul,

32:49.175 --> 32:51.604
and of all the saints,
who by your grace,

32:51.639 --> 32:53.243
gained victory over evil.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.775
Free your servant from
this diabolical oppression

32:57.810 --> 33:00.316
and keep her unharmed,
that she may return

33:00.351 --> 33:04.122
to the serenity of being
your faithful child,

33:04.157 --> 33:07.488
to love you wholeheartedly,
to serve you by doing good-

33:07.523 --> 33:09.787
- Lies, lies, lies!

33:09.822 --> 33:12.658
- And to honor you
and bring you glory,

33:14.134 --> 33:17.168
her whole life being a
song of praise to you.

33:18.831 --> 33:22.305
(slow dramatic music continues)

33:22.340 --> 33:26.111
Evil being, tell me your name.

33:26.146 --> 33:30.280
(Mary speaking in
foreign language)

33:30.315 --> 33:33.349
I order you, evil one,
seducer of mankind,

33:34.715 --> 33:37.683
recognize the spirit
of truth and grace,

33:37.718 --> 33:40.587
the spirit that
rejects your deceptions

33:40.622 --> 33:42.721
and unmasks your lies.

33:42.756 --> 33:44.822
Abandon this creature Susan.

33:48.498 --> 33:50.498
Through the anointing
of his spirit,

33:50.533 --> 33:53.204
God has made you
his holy temple.

34:02.512 --> 34:05.084
(Mary screams)

34:08.419 --> 34:11.321
(slow ominous music)

34:12.720 --> 34:15.523
(bones cracking)

34:23.896 --> 34:27.667
I order you to recognize
the invincible power

34:27.702 --> 34:31.242
of Jesus Christ almighty.

34:31.277 --> 34:35.279
Remove this creature,
abandon Susan's body,

34:35.314 --> 34:38.249
whom the savior, having
been born amongst us,

34:38.284 --> 34:40.713
made her a sister,
died upon the cross,

34:40.748 --> 34:42.550
redeemed her with his blood.

34:43.916 --> 34:45.817
Tell me who you are.

34:45.852 --> 34:49.194
- I am the she who
dwells in here.

34:49.229 --> 34:52.890
- Tell me your name and
leave this creature of God.

34:52.925 --> 34:57.268
(Mary speaking in
foreign language)

34:59.470 --> 35:02.438
Christ orders you from
the height of his power

35:02.473 --> 35:07.179
to abandon his child,
what is you name?

35:07.214 --> 35:11.348
(Mary speaking in
foreign language)

35:18.786 --> 35:20.885
- I am the bride that was killed

35:20.920 --> 35:23.888
at the hands of this bloodline.

35:23.923 --> 35:27.628
(slow ominous music continues)

35:33.834 --> 35:35.900
- I was unable to help her.

35:35.935 --> 35:37.374
In the following weeks,

35:37.409 --> 35:39.475
that evil being came
back to torment him.

35:42.678 --> 35:43.776
He was terrorized.

35:50.653 --> 35:53.753
(slow ominous music)

36:10.376 --> 36:13.344
(slow piano music)

36:19.550 --> 36:22.452
(slow ominous music)

36:28.625 --> 36:30.724
(door creaks)

36:30.759 --> 36:34.332
(ominous orchestral music)

36:36.666 --> 36:38.798
- Who's this being?

36:38.833 --> 36:40.305
- Her name was Mary.

36:41.737 --> 36:44.606
She was your
grandfather's first wife.

36:44.641 --> 36:46.311
- When I'm paralyzed
in my sleep,

36:46.346 --> 36:48.709
they always told me they
were hallucinations.

36:51.879 --> 36:52.977
- [Father Elbert] I'm
afraid they aren't.

36:56.389 --> 36:58.521
- What does she
want from my family?

36:58.556 --> 37:03.053
- The woman disappeared
shortly after the wedding.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.330
The local authorities
could find no trace of her.

37:07.026 --> 37:11.831
Your grandfather remarried
and they had two children,

37:12.900 --> 37:14.801
Susan, your mother, and Eve.

37:16.673 --> 37:18.002
Only Susan survived.

37:24.549 --> 37:26.384
- Good night, darling.

37:27.783 --> 37:30.520
- Mommy, who are you talking to?

37:30.555 --> 37:33.655
(slow ominous music)

37:33.690 --> 37:34.689
(door slams)

37:34.724 --> 37:36.053
(child screams)

37:36.088 --> 37:38.825
(bones cracking)

37:38.860 --> 37:41.399
(ghostly voices whispering)

37:41.434 --> 37:46.437
(slow dramatic music)
(ghostly whispering)

37:53.105 --> 37:54.544
(child screams)

37:54.579 --> 37:56.777
- This evil is present
in our world, Alyson.

38:00.453 --> 38:03.014
Have you sensed any
presences in this house

38:03.049 --> 38:03.949
since you moved in?

38:06.987 --> 38:08.756
How did you feel
these presences?

38:11.497 --> 38:12.331
- I-

38:14.533 --> 38:16.093
- [Father Elbert] Have you
noticed anything strange

38:16.128 --> 38:17.402
in the last few days?

38:18.570 --> 38:20.933
Objects moving, noises?

38:20.968 --> 38:24.409
(slow ominous music)

38:24.444 --> 38:26.543
Alyson, Alyson?

38:27.744 --> 38:29.348
Are you listening to me, Alyson?

38:30.747 --> 38:33.352
(Alyson gasps)

38:38.051 --> 38:38.852
(slow dramatic music)

38:38.887 --> 38:39.985
(Alyson cries out)

38:40.020 --> 38:41.756
What is it, what's there?

38:41.791 --> 38:42.427
- She's here.

38:43.694 --> 38:44.957
I want to get out of here.

38:44.992 --> 38:46.959
- Alyson, listen to me.

38:48.435 --> 38:50.127
It's not the house
that is damned.

38:51.867 --> 38:54.934
It's the family, there's
a curse on all of you,

38:54.969 --> 38:57.640
you, your husband and your son,

38:58.676 --> 38:59.972
you're all in danger.

39:00.007 --> 39:01.710
- What's going on here?

39:01.745 --> 39:02.579
- Richard.

39:04.209 --> 39:07.518
- My name is Father Elbert
and I came here to help you.

39:07.553 --> 39:08.651
- I don't understand.

39:08.686 --> 39:09.949
- We have a problem.

39:09.984 --> 39:12.017
- Problem, what are
you talking about?

39:12.052 --> 39:13.953
- What's been
happening to your wife,

39:13.988 --> 39:16.153
they're not
hallucinations or dreams.

39:16.188 --> 39:18.529
It's a soul in
search of revenge.

39:18.564 --> 39:19.530
- Are you serious?

39:19.565 --> 39:21.026
- Revenge on your family.

39:23.195 --> 39:26.867
There is a chance that
the bride can find peace

39:26.902 --> 39:30.607
if her remains are
recovered, blessed,

39:30.642 --> 39:32.543
and buried in sacred ground.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.875
- Okay, I've heard enough.

39:34.910 --> 39:36.877
Thanks for your visit, but now
I have to ask you to leave.

39:36.912 --> 39:39.616
- Richard, no, Father
Elbert, please.

39:39.651 --> 39:41.145
- It's all right, it's fine.

39:41.180 --> 39:42.487
I'll leave you two now.

39:44.524 --> 39:47.558
- Richard, we need his help.

39:47.593 --> 39:48.823
- Why would we be in danger?

39:49.925 --> 39:51.056
Just because of your nightmares?

39:51.091 --> 39:52.695
You've had them since
you were a girl.

39:52.730 --> 39:53.960
- You weren't here,

39:53.995 --> 39:55.995
you didn't see all the
things that happened.

39:56.030 --> 39:57.502
We need him.

39:57.537 --> 40:00.197
- A priest, you're an atheist.

40:00.232 --> 40:02.672
- I know what I saw,
you have to believe me.

40:04.269 --> 40:06.071
- Alyson, you need
to speak to somebody.

40:08.009 --> 40:10.680
(Alyson scoffs)

40:12.244 --> 40:14.849
- Father, I'm so sorry.

40:16.116 --> 40:18.149
- Don't apologize,
sometimes it's difficult

40:18.184 --> 40:20.657
to believe in that which
we don't understand.

40:20.692 --> 40:24.991
- So finding the bride's
remains, could that help?

40:27.193 --> 40:28.929
- Come to me tomorrow morning.

40:28.964 --> 40:30.568
Bring the boy, don't
leave him here.

40:32.066 --> 40:33.736
We will find a solution.

40:54.253 --> 40:57.595
(car engine sputters)

41:05.902 --> 41:08.705
(car engine stalls)

41:19.850 --> 41:22.752
(slow ominous music)

41:39.298 --> 41:42.299
(car engine stalls)

41:45.645 --> 41:49.306
(slow ominous music continues)

42:01.287 --> 42:04.024
(car door slams)

42:12.100 --> 42:15.200
(radio music blares)

42:32.285 --> 42:35.594
(slow ominous music)

42:39.358 --> 42:42.128
(car door slams)

42:45.100 --> 42:49.905
Our Lord, our Father,
I ask and implore you

42:51.007 --> 42:54.008
for a straight put to flight

42:54.043 --> 42:57.748
and drive out all
these diabolical powers

43:00.049 --> 43:04.755
and diabolical presences,
Satanic machinations,

43:06.121 --> 43:09.254
every evil influence,
(car door handle rattles)

43:09.289 --> 43:11.388
every curse and evil eye.

43:17.803 --> 43:22.399
- Bride.
(slow dramatic music)

43:23.743 --> 43:26.337
(Alyson trembles)

43:29.782 --> 43:31.914
(Seth coos)

44:00.307 --> 44:01.207
- Richard?

44:10.185 --> 44:11.118
Father Elbert.

44:11.153 --> 44:14.055
(slow ominous music)

44:33.340 --> 44:34.141
(slow dramatic music)

44:34.176 --> 44:36.077
(Alyson shrieks)

44:36.112 --> 44:36.946
Richard!

44:38.048 --> 44:40.477
(slow ominous music)

44:40.512 --> 44:41.313
Richard!

44:41.348 --> 44:42.952
(door rattles)

44:42.987 --> 44:44.415
Richard!

44:44.450 --> 44:46.285
- The door won't open!

44:47.827 --> 44:50.124
(Alyson shrieks)

44:50.159 --> 44:52.291
(Alyson screams)

44:52.326 --> 44:56.130
(slow ominous music continues)

44:56.165 --> 44:58.363
(Mary roars)

45:12.852 --> 45:14.016
Alyson, what happened?

45:17.252 --> 45:22.057
- Seth. (cries)

45:23.324 --> 45:25.192
(wind whistles)

45:25.227 --> 45:27.799
(Alyson cries)

45:30.562 --> 45:33.904
(camera lens clicks)

45:44.180 --> 45:45.410
- Can you tell me

45:45.445 --> 45:48.083
what time you realized
the baby was missing?

45:48.118 --> 45:50.184
- It must have
been around three.

45:51.990 --> 45:54.419
- And the room is exactly
how you found it, right?

45:54.454 --> 45:56.388
- Exactly, we haven't
touched anything.

46:01.263 --> 46:04.330
- Do you have any reason

46:04.365 --> 46:07.366
to believe somebody could
have any problems with you?

46:07.401 --> 46:09.335
- Problems, with us?

46:09.370 --> 46:12.041
- Yes, have you
argued with anybody?

46:12.076 --> 46:14.175
Do you have any enemies here?

46:14.210 --> 46:17.442
- No, as I told you,
we've only just moved in.

46:17.477 --> 46:19.543
- Usually these kinds of
kidnappings are followed

46:19.578 --> 46:24.086
by ransom demands, so
always answer your phone.

46:24.121 --> 46:26.583
Every incoming and ongoing
call will be recorded.

46:27.927 --> 46:29.124
In the meantime,

46:29.159 --> 46:30.587
we'll do everything we
can to find your child.

46:45.340 --> 46:49.111
- There was a phenomenon
in the living room.

46:50.950 --> 46:54.380
The door was closed and I
just couldn't get them open,

46:54.415 --> 46:57.251
and I'm sure there was
no one on the other side.

46:59.024 --> 46:59.583
- Hmm.

47:18.340 --> 47:19.504
Can you show me the bedroom?

47:37.326 --> 47:40.294
- [Alyson] Neither me or my
husband had mentioned a bedroom,

47:40.329 --> 47:42.032
how did-
- How did I know?

47:42.694 --> 47:43.528
- [Alyson] Yeah.

47:51.208 --> 47:52.537
- [Richard] What's
in your pocket?

47:54.541 --> 47:56.376
- Excuse me?

47:56.411 --> 47:57.509
- [Richard] Your
pocket, I can see

47:57.544 --> 47:59.016
you're playing with something.

48:00.646 --> 48:01.480
- Yes.

48:11.030 --> 48:14.328
It's like a marble, I
always carry it with me.

48:14.363 --> 48:15.230
It was given to me by,

48:17.498 --> 48:19.069
it was given to me
a long time ago.

48:20.468 --> 48:22.435
- And what does it do?

48:22.470 --> 48:23.403
- It changes color.

48:25.341 --> 48:29.145
Now it's clear, see, that's
good, that's positive.

48:29.180 --> 48:31.081
It means the situation
around us is stable.

48:31.116 --> 48:33.248
There's no other presence here.

48:33.283 --> 48:35.987
When it goes gray, that
means there is a presence,

48:36.022 --> 48:37.549
but that's usually
a benevolent one.

48:37.584 --> 48:39.188
Most spirits don't
mean us any harm.

48:40.554 --> 48:43.258
And when it goes very
dark, that means, well.

48:49.101 --> 48:49.726
- Well?

48:51.466 --> 48:53.004
- Well, it means
we're in trouble.

48:56.438 --> 48:59.109
Alyson, you felt these
presences first, is that right?

49:02.510 --> 49:06.050
(slow orchestral music)

49:07.251 --> 49:09.350
I want you to hold onto
the photograph of Seth

49:11.816 --> 49:13.354
and I need you to
close your eyes.

49:15.160 --> 49:18.260
And whatever you hear,
whatever you feel,

49:19.659 --> 49:22.231
I need you to keep your
eyes closed, understand?

49:24.136 --> 49:28.105
Good, now I want you
to visualize Seth,

49:29.504 --> 49:31.108
really focus on your son.

49:33.772 --> 49:36.410
And your thoughts will travel
through you as emotions.

49:39.580 --> 49:41.712
Really try to see him
in your mind's eye.

49:43.617 --> 49:45.716
That's very good,
Alyson, very good.

49:48.325 --> 49:51.161
(slow ominous music)

49:57.565 --> 50:00.401
(stroller creaks)

50:06.838 --> 50:10.774
(slow ominous music continues)

50:26.561 --> 50:28.495
I am truly sorry for
what happened to you,

50:30.664 --> 50:33.302
but I have not come
here to negotiate.

50:33.337 --> 50:35.205
This family wants
their son back,

50:35.240 --> 50:37.174
the child you have
taken from them.

50:41.675 --> 50:44.709
(slow ominous music)

51:12.442 --> 51:14.871
(Mary scratching)

51:20.549 --> 51:23.517
(slow dramatic music)

51:25.620 --> 51:27.455
From what Father Elbert told you

51:27.490 --> 51:30.557
and from what I have been
able to verify for myself,

51:30.592 --> 51:32.922
I have reached a conclusion,
but I need to be very clear,

51:32.957 --> 51:36.695
this is just an
opinion, it's a theory.

51:36.730 --> 51:38.895
- We're here to listen to you.

51:38.930 --> 51:39.764
- Okay.

51:43.539 --> 51:47.277
When I first came into this
house, what I felt was anger,

51:49.446 --> 51:50.544
so much anger.

51:50.579 --> 51:52.612
(slow ominous music)

51:52.647 --> 51:54.713
The spirit we are dealing
with wants revenge.

51:54.748 --> 51:56.847
She wants back what
was taken from her.

51:56.882 --> 52:00.917
She craves life, but
not just her own life,

52:00.952 --> 52:02.358
the fetus in the cradle.

52:03.691 --> 52:05.625
- What does it mean?

52:05.660 --> 52:06.725
- The bride was pregnant.

52:08.663 --> 52:11.367
When she was murdered, she
lost not just her own life,

52:11.402 --> 52:12.929
but also that of
her unborn child.

52:14.834 --> 52:16.636
The symbol on the wall tells me

52:16.671 --> 52:19.903
that she has asked for help
from a very powerful and, uh,

52:21.775 --> 52:23.907
a very evil force.

52:23.942 --> 52:26.613
- What, what evil force?

52:27.781 --> 52:31.981
- Asmodeus, Asmodeus is a demon.

52:32.016 --> 52:34.951
He's a great king in
the hierarchy of the
infernal spirits.

52:34.986 --> 52:37.723
He's the lord of
wrath and vengeance,

52:37.758 --> 52:40.330
and I think that's who you've
been seeing in the house.

52:42.367 --> 52:44.235
He has granted the
bride's spirit the power

52:44.270 --> 52:48.965
to return from the
dead for revenge.

52:49.000 --> 52:52.342
- And if we did what
Father Elbert suggested,

52:52.377 --> 52:54.773
find the bride's
remains, bless them, and-

52:54.808 --> 52:56.478
- Find the bride's
remains, bless them,

52:56.513 --> 52:57.512
and then bury them again.

52:59.384 --> 53:01.219
It's not going to
bring Seth back.

53:02.717 --> 53:05.652
And on the contrary, it risks
closing forever the link

53:05.687 --> 53:09.788
that is now open between our
world and the bride's world.

53:09.823 --> 53:12.791
- So how do we bring Seth back?

53:15.631 --> 53:18.368
- There is one thing
I think we can try,

53:18.403 --> 53:21.701
but you are going
to have to trust me.

53:21.736 --> 53:25.342
- I'm sorry, I should have
believed you from the start.

53:26.840 --> 53:29.775
- It can't have been
easy for you to believe.

53:29.810 --> 53:32.844
(slow piano music)

53:32.879 --> 53:34.384
(Richard sighs)

53:34.419 --> 53:35.253
- Forgive me.

53:38.885 --> 53:41.556
Bring our son back, hmm?

53:42.757 --> 53:45.054
- Listen carefully, Alyson.

53:45.089 --> 53:47.463
You will meet many
souls on this journey,

53:48.895 --> 53:51.533
and some of them will
be familiar to you,

53:51.568 --> 53:53.799
others you will not recognize.

53:53.834 --> 53:58.001
Pay close attention to every
single one of them, okay?

53:58.036 --> 53:58.837
- [Alyson] Okay.

54:00.643 --> 54:02.808
- Now, this device will
sound to start your journey.

54:02.843 --> 54:05.382
It will also sound
to end the journey

54:05.417 --> 54:08.385
and bring you back to us,
and it's really important

54:08.420 --> 54:10.453
when that happens that
you have Seth with you.

54:10.488 --> 54:13.588
So if you find him, don't
let him out of your sight.

54:16.362 --> 54:18.329
You might need
this, hold onto it.

54:19.596 --> 54:21.398
(slow music)

54:21.433 --> 54:23.664
You ready for everything
that's going to happen?

54:23.699 --> 54:25.402
- Yes.

54:25.437 --> 54:29.065
- Okay, in that case,
you can close your eyes.

54:47.426 --> 54:49.624
(static crackles)

54:49.659 --> 54:52.726
I want you to tell me
about a happy memory.

54:55.060 --> 54:56.466
- The birth of my child.

54:59.163 --> 55:01.570
- [Dave] Where was he born,
who was with you, Alyson?

55:03.101 --> 55:04.738
- At the Craig General Hospital.

55:05.906 --> 55:07.807
Richard was there with me.

55:07.842 --> 55:11.107
- [Dave] Okay, tell me more,
as much detail as you can.

55:12.847 --> 55:14.946
- I entered the operating room.

55:16.587 --> 55:20.721
My midwife was there with
me, laughing and joking.

55:22.186 --> 55:26.463
Then two big pushes, and
he came to the world.

55:28.192 --> 55:32.634
He was crying and they
placed him in my arms,

55:32.669 --> 55:37.441
and I started
crying, too. (laughs)

55:37.476 --> 55:38.134
I kissed him.

55:42.514 --> 55:43.975
The moment I looked

55:44.010 --> 55:48.452
into his eyes was the most
beautiful moment of my life.

55:51.556 --> 55:56.152
Richard ran to me, tears
running down his face,

55:58.024 --> 56:01.531
and he hugged me, thanking me
for the son I have given him.

56:06.604 --> 56:09.869
- [Dave] That's excellent,
that's really good, Alyson.

56:09.904 --> 56:14.544
Now keep that happy memory
with you as you start to relax.

56:14.579 --> 56:16.139
Take a nice big deep breath in,

56:18.880 --> 56:21.716
and relax, good, and in,

56:24.853 --> 56:25.687
and relax.

56:26.921 --> 56:28.151
And with each breath in,

56:28.186 --> 56:30.494
the body's going to
relax more and more.

56:33.026 --> 56:34.894
Be aware of how the sound

56:34.929 --> 56:37.798
you can hear also helps
the body feel more relaxed.

56:41.001 --> 56:42.704
Feel the fingers relax.

56:44.741 --> 56:46.972
Body starting to feel
a little heavier now,

56:47.007 --> 56:48.743
but it's a very
pleasant heaviness.

56:50.615 --> 56:53.176
Abandon yourself to those
sensations you're feeling.

56:54.751 --> 56:58.852
That's good, your
mind is active,

56:58.887 --> 57:01.657
but the body is feeling
a little heavier.

57:04.057 --> 57:05.529
And we breathe in,

57:07.995 --> 57:09.027
and we sleep.

57:10.998 --> 57:12.470
And we breathe in,

57:14.265 --> 57:15.572
and we sleep.

57:17.103 --> 57:18.542
And we breathe in,

57:20.744 --> 57:21.611
and we sleep.

57:24.110 --> 57:24.944
- [Alyson] Dave?

57:27.553 --> 57:28.486
What's happening?

57:31.249 --> 57:32.083
Nothing?

57:33.757 --> 57:34.591
It didn't work?

57:38.124 --> 57:38.958
Dave?

57:40.291 --> 57:43.501
(flashlight clicks)

57:45.065 --> 57:47.901
(Alyson trembles)

57:49.773 --> 57:50.607
Richard!

57:54.239 --> 57:55.810
Let me out of here!

57:59.651 --> 58:00.518
Dave, help!

58:03.820 --> 58:05.281
- And now?

58:05.316 --> 58:08.988
- Shh, now she's on her
journey, we need to wait.

58:09.023 --> 58:09.956
(Alyson knocks)

58:09.991 --> 58:11.760
- [Alyson] Help!

58:11.795 --> 58:14.664
(slow ominous music)

58:17.900 --> 58:20.296
(Alyson pants)

58:32.981 --> 58:35.619
(Mary scratching)

58:38.118 --> 58:41.823
(slow ominous music continues)

58:49.734 --> 58:53.197
(Mary scratching)

58:53.232 --> 58:56.970
(slow ominous music continues)

58:58.171 --> 58:59.005
(slow dramatic music)

58:59.040 --> 59:00.204
(Alyson shrieks)

59:00.239 --> 59:03.339
(slow ghostly whispering)

59:12.383 --> 59:15.384
(slow TV music)

59:15.419 --> 59:17.386
- And then she said to me
that she didn't want to go

59:17.421 --> 59:19.993
with them and that she
wanted to stay with us.

59:20.028 --> 59:22.699
So I whispered to her,
"I'm sorry, Alyson.

59:22.734 --> 59:25.064
I don't think
that's a good idea."

59:25.099 --> 59:28.903
And she replied, "Please,
Daddy, listen, please.

59:28.938 --> 59:30.872
Don't send me away with them."

59:30.907 --> 59:33.402
(audience laughs)
(Susan laughs)

59:33.437 --> 59:36.141
So I turned around, I was about
to close the door, (sighs)

59:36.176 --> 59:39.749
and she looked at me
with tears in her eyes

59:39.784 --> 59:42.752
and said, "Bye bye,
Daddy, I love you."

59:44.250 --> 59:45.986
(audience laughs)

59:46.021 --> 59:48.857
I know, I'll call her up
on the phone right now

59:48.892 --> 59:52.762
and say, "Bye bye, little
orphan girl, I love you."

59:52.797 --> 59:54.797
(audience laughs)
(Susan laughs)

59:54.832 --> 59:57.866
- No, that's not very nice,
you can't do that to her.

59:57.901 --> 1:00:00.099
- Seriously, so I can't write,

1:00:00.134 --> 1:00:02.101
"bye bye, little orphan
girl, I love you,"

1:00:02.136 --> 1:00:04.367
on a piece of paper
and send it by fax?

1:00:04.402 --> 1:00:05.203
- No.

1:00:05.238 --> 1:00:07.106
(audience laughs)

1:00:07.141 --> 1:00:10.043
(slow ominous music)

1:00:12.817 --> 1:00:15.411
- [Susan] Wake up,
darling, wake up.

1:00:19.384 --> 1:00:20.856
- Mom?

1:00:20.891 --> 1:00:23.419
(slow piano music)

1:00:25.093 --> 1:00:26.455
Mom.

1:00:26.490 --> 1:00:30.129
- Don't worry,
everything's fine.

1:00:30.164 --> 1:00:31.295
Everything's fine, honey.

1:00:33.464 --> 1:00:37.301
Oh, you must have had
a really bad dream.

1:00:37.336 --> 1:00:38.874
- I love you, Mom. (cries)

1:00:38.909 --> 1:00:40.711
- I love you, too.

1:00:40.746 --> 1:00:44.242
(slow piano music continues)

1:00:46.180 --> 1:00:47.377
- But you're dead.

1:00:48.985 --> 1:00:50.446
- Sooner or later,
everybody dies.

1:00:53.187 --> 1:00:54.890
But that day is still far away.

1:00:58.896 --> 1:01:00.390
I came to bring you
a hot water bottle.

1:01:03.131 --> 1:01:03.965
You've wet the bed.

1:01:05.199 --> 1:01:07.001
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1:01:07.036 --> 1:01:09.806
- Don't worry, let
me change the sheets.

1:01:10.875 --> 1:01:12.105
- All right.

1:01:12.140 --> 1:01:14.910
- Don't worry, help
me change the sheets.

1:01:15.946 --> 1:01:18.848
(slow ominous music)

1:01:23.283 --> 1:01:25.921
(thunder crashes)

1:01:27.221 --> 1:01:29.826
(Alyson gasps)

1:01:30.895 --> 1:01:34.798
(slow ominous music continues)

1:01:35.966 --> 1:01:38.802
(thunder rumbles)

1:01:39.838 --> 1:01:41.167
- You seem nervous, Richard.

1:01:41.202 --> 1:01:42.333
- Thanks for noticing.

1:01:43.875 --> 1:01:45.809
- Everything's going as planned.

1:01:45.844 --> 1:01:47.536
- How long before
she comes back?

1:01:47.571 --> 1:01:49.373
- I don't know the
answer to that question.

1:01:51.014 --> 1:01:52.915
- How long does it normally
take in cases like this?

1:01:52.950 --> 1:01:55.016
- I don't exactly do this
kind of thing every day.

1:01:56.415 --> 1:01:58.382
- How often have you
done something similar?

1:02:01.090 --> 1:02:03.321
Christ. (scoffs)

1:02:06.161 --> 1:02:08.491
- Richard, there's something
in my brown bad I think I need.

1:02:08.526 --> 1:02:10.999
It's in the bedroom,
will you get it for me?

1:02:11.034 --> 1:02:15.432
(thunder rumbles)
(slow ominous music)

1:02:15.467 --> 1:02:17.973
(door creaks)

1:02:20.109 --> 1:02:23.847
(slow ominous music continues)

1:02:53.538 --> 1:02:56.605
(door rattles)

1:02:56.640 --> 1:02:59.443
- Dave, Dave, you
need to let me out.

1:03:01.282 --> 1:03:03.084
(door rattles)

1:03:03.119 --> 1:03:03.953
Dave?

1:03:06.254 --> 1:03:08.584
(water trickles)

1:03:42.587 --> 1:03:46.490
(slow ominous music continues)

1:04:01.474 --> 1:04:04.640
(slow dramatic music)

1:04:07.447 --> 1:04:09.953
- [Woman] Good night, darling.

1:04:11.154 --> 1:04:14.155
- [Child] Mommy, who
are you talking to?

1:04:14.190 --> 1:04:16.960
(bones cracking)

1:04:24.695 --> 1:04:26.266
(child screams)

1:04:26.301 --> 1:04:29.566
(slow ominous music continues)

1:04:29.601 --> 1:04:32.107
(Nelson sobs)

1:04:35.244 --> 1:04:38.916
- Eve, (cries) my princess.

1:04:41.580 --> 1:04:46.385
You didn't have to die. (cries)

1:04:48.554 --> 1:04:50.158
My little princess.

1:04:55.726 --> 1:04:58.397
It's all your fault!

1:04:58.432 --> 1:05:01.334
(slow dramatic music)

1:05:14.085 --> 1:05:17.548
It began with me, and
with me, it shall end.

1:05:21.653 --> 1:05:23.158
Forgive me, Susan.

1:05:25.261 --> 1:05:26.997
(gun fires)

1:05:27.032 --> 1:05:29.659
(thunder rumbles)

1:05:37.603 --> 1:05:40.703
(slow ominous music)

1:05:41.607 --> 1:05:42.441
- Richard?

1:05:46.249 --> 1:05:47.083
Richard?

1:05:48.416 --> 1:05:51.054
(thunder rumbles)

1:05:58.789 --> 1:05:59.590
Richard?

1:06:01.297 --> 1:06:04.694
(ominous orchestral music)

1:06:13.276 --> 1:06:16.376
(Dave cries out)

1:06:16.411 --> 1:06:17.245
Richard!

1:06:19.513 --> 1:06:21.150
Richard, don't
look at the light!

1:06:24.353 --> 1:06:24.780
Richard!

1:06:26.619 --> 1:06:28.289
Richard, we've got
to get out of here.

1:06:29.820 --> 1:06:34.262
(ominous orchestral
music continues)

1:06:43.768 --> 1:06:46.439
(Dave trembles)

1:06:49.246 --> 1:06:50.806
I'm protecting this
woman with sacred herbs.

1:06:50.841 --> 1:06:52.280
No evil spirits may harm her.

1:06:54.548 --> 1:06:56.812
I am protecting this
woman with sacred herbs.

1:06:56.847 --> 1:06:59.452
No evil spirits may harm her.
(door rattles)

1:06:59.487 --> 1:07:01.586
I am protecting this
woman with sacred herbs.

1:07:01.621 --> 1:07:03.324
No evil spirits may harm her.

1:07:03.359 --> 1:07:05.491
I am protecting this woman
with sacred herbs, no-

1:07:06.857 --> 1:07:09.858
(ominous orchestral
music continues)

1:07:09.893 --> 1:07:11.629
I'm protecting this
woman with sacred herbs.

1:07:11.664 --> 1:07:14.467
No evil spirits may harm her.

1:07:14.502 --> 1:07:16.370
I'm protecting this
woman with sacred herbs.

1:07:16.405 --> 1:07:18.207
No evil spirits may harm her.

1:07:21.839 --> 1:07:23.179
Come on, Alyson.

1:07:24.677 --> 1:07:25.511
Come on.

1:07:26.712 --> 1:07:29.812
(slow ominous music)

1:07:49.801 --> 1:07:53.176
(slow dramatic music)

1:08:35.781 --> 1:08:39.222
- Alyson, it's good
to see you again.

1:08:40.753 --> 1:08:42.555
You've grown up to
be a beautiful woman.

1:08:46.297 --> 1:08:48.858
I never should have
sent you away from me.

1:08:48.893 --> 1:08:51.960
- I always hoped you would
have come and get me,

1:08:51.995 --> 1:08:53.797
that I would have
seen you again.

1:08:53.832 --> 1:08:55.568
- I made a terrible mistake.

1:08:56.934 --> 1:08:59.539
I left my only joy in
the hands of others.

1:09:01.246 --> 1:09:03.180
But now we can
make up for things.

1:09:03.974 --> 1:09:06.942
(slow piano music)

1:09:10.783 --> 1:09:15.588
We'll be together again,
me, you, your mother.

1:09:17.361 --> 1:09:18.261
- No.

1:09:18.296 --> 1:09:21.396
- Yes, we'll be a family again.

1:09:21.431 --> 1:09:23.563
- I, I came to look for my son.

1:09:23.598 --> 1:09:26.665
- I know, and I can't
wait to meet him.

1:09:26.700 --> 1:09:30.207
- It's not possible,
Dad, we're not staying.

1:09:31.771 --> 1:09:33.276
I'm taking him away from here.

1:09:34.642 --> 1:09:37.841
- Losing your daughter
is a painful experience.

1:09:39.779 --> 1:09:41.911
Losing her twice
is heartbreaking.

1:09:44.553 --> 1:09:48.819
I was a terrible father
and an even worse husband,

1:09:49.921 --> 1:09:52.295
but I can make up for that now.

1:09:52.330 --> 1:09:54.924
Everybody deserves
a second chance.

1:09:54.959 --> 1:09:58.334
- It can't happen, not anymore.

1:10:00.338 --> 1:10:02.800
We weren't together
when we could have been.

1:10:02.835 --> 1:10:04.307
We can't be together now.

1:10:07.873 --> 1:10:08.707
Dad,

1:10:10.546 --> 1:10:11.380
please.

1:10:12.746 --> 1:10:13.877
Help me find Seth.

1:10:15.617 --> 1:10:17.485
Please.

1:10:17.520 --> 1:10:21.555
- When you were younger, you
always used to enjoy drawing.

1:10:22.954 --> 1:10:23.788
Do you remember?

1:10:25.330 --> 1:10:27.693
It was your way
of communicating.

1:10:29.763 --> 1:10:33.666
I never understood any of
your drawings, how could I?

1:10:37.474 --> 1:10:39.573
Perhaps one of them will
help you to find your son.

1:10:41.038 --> 1:10:45.040
Alyson, go now, there
isn't much time left.

1:10:45.075 --> 1:10:45.909
- Thank you, Dad.

1:10:54.755 --> 1:10:57.690
(slow dramatic music)

1:11:06.569 --> 1:11:08.866
(water drips)

1:11:21.650 --> 1:11:24.552
(slow ambient music)

1:11:28.888 --> 1:11:30.855
(slow dramatic music)

1:11:30.890 --> 1:11:33.088
(Mary moans)

1:11:42.165 --> 1:11:44.506
- You forced me
to make a choice.

1:11:44.541 --> 1:11:48.070
- You're scaring me, why
are you doing this to me?

1:11:49.106 --> 1:11:51.645
- You don't remember anything?

1:11:51.680 --> 1:11:55.418
- No, I don't know what
you're talking about.

1:11:56.113 --> 1:11:57.750
(slow ominous music)

1:11:57.785 --> 1:11:59.422
(Nelson cries)

1:11:59.457 --> 1:12:00.720
- I am so sorry.

1:12:00.755 --> 1:12:03.492
- Nelson, darling,
look at me, it's me,

1:12:04.792 --> 1:12:06.429
your love, your wife.

1:12:07.696 --> 1:12:11.962
Let's go back home, I'm
begging you. (cries)

1:12:11.997 --> 1:12:12.831
I'm pregnant!

1:12:13.999 --> 1:12:17.099
(slow ominous music)

1:12:20.643 --> 1:12:22.478
(gun cocks)

1:12:22.513 --> 1:12:25.613
I will devour your soul and
the souls of the ones you love,

1:12:25.648 --> 1:12:29.683
dead son of a bitch,
you'll never be free of me.

1:12:29.718 --> 1:12:34.523
(slow ominous music continues)
(slow ghostly whispering)

1:12:39.860 --> 1:12:44.500
In the darkness, I
will slaughter your
children like pigs.

1:12:46.064 --> 1:12:50.407
(Mary speaking in
foreign language)

1:12:52.873 --> 1:12:55.412
(Alyson cries)

1:12:58.813 --> 1:13:00.945
(Seth wails)

1:13:05.886 --> 1:13:08.458
(Alyson cries)

1:13:13.025 --> 1:13:15.894
(slow ominous music)

1:13:17.667 --> 1:13:19.799
(Seth coos)

1:13:31.208 --> 1:13:34.583
(slow dramatic music)

1:13:37.951 --> 1:13:40.589
(Alyson trembles)

1:13:49.963 --> 1:13:51.732
- [Mary And Nelson]
We won't let you go.

1:13:51.767 --> 1:13:52.931
We won't let you go, Alyson.

1:13:53.934 --> 1:13:54.933
We are a family now.

1:13:56.299 --> 1:13:58.937
We are a family, we
won't let you go.

1:13:58.972 --> 1:14:01.577
We won't let you go, Alyson.

1:14:01.612 --> 1:14:02.237
- [Mary] We are a family now.

1:14:03.779 --> 1:14:06.747
- [Dave] Relax and breathe.

1:14:06.782 --> 1:14:08.243
(Alyson hyperventilates)

1:14:08.278 --> 1:14:09.783
Relax and breathe.

1:14:11.787 --> 1:14:14.623
(Alyson trembles)

1:14:21.764 --> 1:14:24.732
(slow dramatic music)

1:14:25.834 --> 1:14:27.064
- Oh, you're okay.

1:14:27.099 --> 1:14:27.999
- My baby.

1:14:28.034 --> 1:14:30.606
- Okay, and deep breaths.

1:14:30.641 --> 1:14:31.640
- He was with me, he was-
- I know.

1:14:31.675 --> 1:14:33.103
- He was here with me.

1:14:33.138 --> 1:14:37.239
- Try to stay calm, that's
better, that's better.

1:14:39.309 --> 1:14:40.979
- She took him away from me.

1:14:41.014 --> 1:14:41.914
- I'm sorry, Alyson.

1:14:44.314 --> 1:14:45.819
- Send me back.

1:14:45.854 --> 1:14:46.281
- I can't.

1:14:47.922 --> 1:14:48.822
- I have to go back.

1:14:48.857 --> 1:14:50.285
- It's too dangerous.

1:14:50.320 --> 1:14:53.794
- No, I, he, I have, I have
to go back and get him.

1:14:53.829 --> 1:14:56.324
- Sending you once was risky,
I shouldn't have done it.

1:14:56.359 --> 1:14:58.095
Sending you twice
could kill you.

1:14:58.130 --> 1:14:59.899
- I don't care, you
have to send me-

1:14:59.934 --> 1:15:00.768
- I care.

1:15:03.102 --> 1:15:03.734
I care.

1:15:05.137 --> 1:15:08.270
- You don't understand, he was,

1:15:08.305 --> 1:15:11.911
he was with me, he
was here with me.

1:15:11.946 --> 1:15:12.582
- Alyson.

1:15:14.718 --> 1:15:17.851
You did everything you
could possibly have done.

1:15:19.987 --> 1:15:22.185
(Seth cries)

1:15:23.826 --> 1:15:27.696
Wait, Aly, Alyson, wait, it
might not be safe, Alyson!

1:15:27.731 --> 1:15:29.126
(Seth cries)
(slow piano music)

1:15:29.161 --> 1:15:29.995
- Richard?

1:15:32.230 --> 1:15:34.835
- I have to thank you
once more for our baby.

1:15:38.170 --> 1:15:41.270
(Alyson cries)

1:15:41.305 --> 1:15:45.043
(slow piano music continues)

1:16:11.170 --> 1:16:12.202
- [Dave] Richard.

1:16:12.237 --> 1:16:13.071
- Dave.

1:16:14.943 --> 1:16:16.239
I was wondering when you
would have come to see us.

1:16:16.274 --> 1:16:17.713
- Well, I was in
the neighborhood.

1:16:17.748 --> 1:16:19.682
I thought I'd pass by,
just in time, I see.

1:16:19.717 --> 1:16:21.948
- Yeah, we're leaving
this afternoon.

1:16:21.983 --> 1:16:24.082
The estate agent will take care
of all the other furniture.

1:16:24.117 --> 1:16:26.018
- Good, where are you moving to?

1:16:26.053 --> 1:16:28.284
- Oh, we found a small
place on the East Coast.

1:16:28.319 --> 1:16:30.891
- Nice, how are they both?

1:16:30.926 --> 1:16:32.189
- They couldn't be better.

1:16:32.224 --> 1:16:34.290
Alyson is a completely
different person now,

1:16:34.325 --> 1:16:35.225
much more serene.

1:16:35.260 --> 1:16:37.029
- Excellent, are they home?

1:16:37.064 --> 1:16:37.700
- Yes, they are.

1:16:39.033 --> 1:16:41.231
Anyway, I, I never thanked you

1:16:41.266 --> 1:16:42.837
for what you did for my family.

1:16:45.402 --> 1:16:46.907
- Still can't get
used to being thanked.

1:16:46.942 --> 1:16:49.976
I'm using being called
a charlatan. (laughs)

1:16:50.011 --> 1:16:51.813
- I can imagine.

1:16:51.848 --> 1:16:53.914
So I'll finish up here
and I'll see you inside.

1:16:53.949 --> 1:16:54.750
- Yeah.

1:17:03.992 --> 1:17:04.419
Alyson?

1:17:12.231 --> 1:17:13.098
Alyson?

1:17:28.016 --> 1:17:29.477
Hey, Seth.

1:17:29.512 --> 1:17:33.723
Hey, hello, little
man, where's mommy?

1:17:35.221 --> 1:17:36.891
You don't know?

1:17:36.926 --> 1:17:38.926
(Seth coos)

1:17:38.961 --> 1:17:40.455
Hey, you want to play?

1:17:41.964 --> 1:17:43.260
You haven't got any toys.

1:17:43.295 --> 1:17:45.328
Hey, where are your toys?

1:17:47.332 --> 1:17:49.068
I've got something, hang on.

1:17:49.103 --> 1:17:50.300
It's not exactly a toy, but.

1:17:53.107 --> 1:17:55.239
(Seth coos)

1:17:59.245 --> 1:18:01.014
- Hey, Dave.

1:18:01.049 --> 1:18:02.180
- Hey, hi.

1:18:04.349 --> 1:18:05.953
- [Alyson] When did you arrive?

1:18:05.988 --> 1:18:08.318
- Just now, I did call
out, you didn't hear me?

1:18:08.353 --> 1:18:12.124
- Oh, no, I was
upstairs, finishing
packing all our things.

1:18:12.159 --> 1:18:15.325
- Right, I just
came to say goodbye.

1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:16.733
- [Alyson] That's nice of you.

1:18:19.804 --> 1:18:21.298
Is everything okay?

1:18:21.333 --> 1:18:22.871
- Yeah, everything's fine.

1:18:24.468 --> 1:18:28.305
Um, look, I have
to, I have to go.

1:18:30.342 --> 1:18:31.506
- [Alyson] You seem worried.

1:18:31.541 --> 1:18:33.475
- Worried? No.

1:18:34.918 --> 1:18:35.752
Should I be?

1:18:36.920 --> 1:18:37.754
- No.

1:18:41.991 --> 1:18:44.222
Aren't you a bit old to
be playing with marbles?

1:18:50.934 --> 1:18:53.495
- Oh, I think you're
much older than I am.

1:18:53.530 --> 1:18:55.398
(slow ominous music)

1:18:55.433 --> 1:19:00.205
- This is the last one. (sighs)

1:19:08.116 --> 1:19:11.887
(slow ominous music continues)

1:19:32.602 --> 1:19:35.570
(footsteps pattering)

1:19:40.984 --> 1:19:44.920
(slow ominous music continues)

1:19:47.419 --> 1:19:52.224
(Seth cries)
(slow dramatic music)

1:20:27.426 --> 1:20:30.262
(Richard trembles)

1:20:30.297 --> 1:20:33.430
(Alyson grunts)

1:20:33.465 --> 1:20:37.467
(slow dramatic music continues)

1:20:45.048 --> 1:20:47.279
(ax rattles)

1:20:54.255 --> 1:20:56.959
(glass shatters)

1:20:58.061 --> 1:21:01.128
(dramatic choral music)

1:21:07.367 --> 1:21:10.302
(slow piano music)

1:21:27.651 --> 1:21:30.993
(slow orchestral music)
