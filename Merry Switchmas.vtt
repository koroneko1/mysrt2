- [Denise] Mrs. Baxter.

01:05.586 --> 01:06.689
- Hi, how are you?

01:06.689 --> 01:07.551
- Good.

01:07.551 --> 01:08.655
- Please sit.

01:10.517 --> 01:12.482
- Thank you so much
for meeting with me.

01:12.482 --> 01:13.310
- Oh sure.

01:14.655 --> 01:16.344
I'm all ears.

01:16.344 --> 01:18.620
- As you may know, I'm
graduating next month

01:18.620 --> 01:20.586
with my PhD in engineering,

01:20.586 --> 01:22.344
and I'm looking to leave
my current position.

01:22.344 --> 01:23.862
- At your father's company?

01:23.862 --> 01:24.724
- Right.

01:26.551 --> 01:28.758
I want to be a part of a
younger company, like yours.

01:28.758 --> 01:31.517
- Ambitious, I like that.

01:31.517 --> 01:34.551
Now, why should I
consider having you

01:34.551 --> 01:36.793
head up my
engineering department

01:36.793 --> 01:38.448
when I have the
cream of the crop,

01:38.448 --> 01:41.206
just to consider
for the opening.

01:42.344 --> 01:45.379
- To date, I've created 17 apps,

01:45.379 --> 01:47.379
I'm fluent in a dozen
programming languages,

01:47.379 --> 01:50.517
including Pearl,
C++, C, and Assembly,

01:50.517 --> 01:52.517
just to name a few.

01:52.517 --> 01:55.689
I manage my own team, I
design my own programs,

01:55.689 --> 01:59.172
I create the code, and I
test the software for bugs.

01:59.172 --> 02:00.620
- Yes, I see that.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.413
It is impressive.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.689
But I don't think
you have all the-

02:04.689 --> 02:07.413
- I understand that you
are looking to create

02:07.413 --> 02:10.344
a new sensory network
for energy efficiency.

02:10.344 --> 02:14.482
So I've gone ahead and created
an algorithm for your company

02:14.482 --> 02:16.310
to prevent against signal loss.

02:16.310 --> 02:16.965
- Oh wow.

02:18.551 --> 02:20.551
Your work is impeccable.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.344
But how do I know that this move

02:25.344 --> 02:28.482
is not the only reason
that you want to work

02:28.482 --> 02:30.586
for Baxter Enterprises?

02:30.586 --> 02:32.724
- Well, there is your son.

02:33.724 --> 02:37.586
- [chuckles] Of course.

02:37.586 --> 02:41.586
Denise look, you're
a lovely young lady.

02:41.586 --> 02:45.655
And the fact that you want to
leave your father's company,

02:45.655 --> 02:49.448
one of my closest
competitors I must add,

02:49.448 --> 02:51.241
isn't lost on me either.

02:51.241 --> 02:53.965
- Miss Baxter, if
I may be so bold,

02:55.517 --> 02:58.241
yes, I want to leave
and spread my own wings,

02:58.241 --> 03:02.413
and yes, I want to work closely
with my boyfriend, your son.

03:02.413 --> 03:04.482
More than that though,
I would love to work

03:04.482 --> 03:06.586
under the tutelage
of a Black woman

03:06.586 --> 03:08.034
who continues to
be at the forefront

03:08.034 --> 03:11.655
of creating a woman
empowered workplace.

03:11.655 --> 03:15.275
- That's quite an
impassioned plea, Denise.

03:16.655 --> 03:19.551
But what would my old
friend Howard think

03:21.551 --> 03:23.517
about you leaving his company

03:23.517 --> 03:26.344
and coming to work for me?

03:26.344 --> 03:29.000
- Honestly, he'll go ape shit.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.586
- [chuckles] Great.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.413
Then, you can
start in two weeks.

03:34.413 --> 03:35.827

03:35.827 --> 03:37.655
- You're so welcome.

03:37.655 --> 03:40.482
Now, you must let
your father know,

03:41.620 --> 03:44.000
sooner than later okay?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.586
Christmas is just two days away,

03:46.586 --> 03:50.310
so I wouldn't want
to blindside him

03:50.310 --> 03:51.965
during the holidays, you know?

03:51.965 --> 03:54.551
- Absolutely, you
won't regret this.

You're at about a 10,

04:32.724 --> 04:34.620
I need you to bring
it down to a 4.

04:34.620 --> 04:36.620

me you won't say anything

04:36.620 --> 04:38.379

04:38.379 --> 04:42.034

04:57.551 --> 04:59.862

tell me something juicy.

basically his clone.

05:25.793 --> 05:27.758

you your entire life.

identical twins,

05:38.931 --> 05:41.103
we look exactly alike.

05:41.103 --> 05:42.827

05:42.827 --> 05:45.655
- Mom and dad love
us both equally,

05:45.655 --> 05:47.034

05:47.034 --> 05:48.517

- Great, I need you to
switch places with me

06:00.862 --> 06:02.793
so you can break the news as me

06:02.793 --> 06:05.931

and starting a new job.

06:05.931 --> 06:07.034

06:09.172 --> 06:10.862
- Why?

06:10.862 --> 06:12.586

06:14.551 --> 06:17.655
Besides, Justin will kill me
if he finds out we switched.

06:19.103 --> 06:21.068
over this whole like,
marriage foolishness.

06:21.068 --> 06:22.896
- Well you did tell the
man if ever he wants

06:22.896 --> 06:24.551
to end your relationship,

06:24.551 --> 06:26.517
all he has to do
is buy you a ring.

06:26.517 --> 06:29.172
- That's right, marriage
is a contract for business

06:29.172 --> 06:31.172
and I refuse to be
contractually obligated

06:31.172 --> 06:32.931
to love anyone.

06:32.931 --> 06:35.206
If he needs a piece of
paper to prove my love,

06:35.206 --> 06:36.551
maybe I'm not the one for him.

06:36.551 --> 06:38.172
- Now you're just being silly.

06:38.172 --> 06:40.620
You have a man who actually
wants to marry you.

06:40.620 --> 06:42.000
Meanwhile, I can't
even get mine to think

06:42.000 --> 06:44.551
about popping the question.

06:44.551 --> 06:47.172
Besides, you know
you love that man.

06:47.172 --> 06:50.172
- Like Tina said, what's
love got to do with it?

06:50.172 --> 06:52.034
- Everything.

06:52.034 --> 06:53.793
And you know men can only
take so much rejection

06:53.793 --> 06:55.689
before they realize they
should just find someone

06:55.689 --> 06:57.172
who wants the same thing.

06:57.172 --> 07:00.241
- Please, he is
not going anywhere.

07:00.241 --> 07:01.896
He loves me.

07:01.896 --> 07:03.793
- You know what? I can't
with you right now.

07:03.793 --> 07:05.620
You make no sense.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.068
- Well that makes two of us.

07:07.068 --> 07:08.758
I can't believe I'm
the one trying to talk

07:08.758 --> 07:10.103

you for a change.

07:10.103 --> 07:12.896
- See? The roles have
already reversed.

You've always been
able to stand up to dad

07:16.172 --> 07:18.137
without the fear of consequence,

07:18.137 --> 07:20.758
I've never been able to do that.

07:20.758 --> 07:23.068
[sighs] Plus, I can't
bear to see that look

07:23.068 --> 07:24.896
of disappointment on his face.

07:24.896 --> 07:26.586
- A look I've grown used to,

07:26.586 --> 07:29.000
since I've seen it
many, many times.

07:29.000 --> 07:31.241
- You're mom's mini-me.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.068
Everything I admire
about you both,

07:37.068 --> 07:39.034
everything that I'm not.

07:39.034 --> 07:42.586
So let's be honest, you've
always been her favorite.

07:42.586 --> 07:44.068
- I have not.

07:44.068 --> 07:46.551
We just have similar
interests, that's all.

07:46.551 --> 07:48.206
- So? What do you say?

07:50.965 --> 07:54.172
- Ugh, when do you want
this foolishness to happen?

07:54.172 --> 07:56.000
- Tomorrow?

07:56.000 --> 07:59.000
- At mom and dad's annual
Christmas Eve party?

07:59.000 --> 08:00.793
You're trippin', no.

08:00.793 --> 08:02.965
- Des, just think about it.

08:02.965 --> 08:05.172
Everyone's gonna be
drinking and celebrating

08:05.172 --> 08:07.068
and having a good time.

08:07.068 --> 08:09.827
No one's gonna be paying
that close attention to us.

08:09.827 --> 08:12.241
Plus, dad won't have a
chance to make a scene

08:12.241 --> 08:16.275
just in case he decides to go-
- He goes ape shit.

08:17.379 --> 08:19.689
Hmm, you might have a point.

08:20.862 --> 08:22.724
But why should I
do this for you?

08:22.724 --> 08:24.655
- Because you love your sister.

08:24.655 --> 08:27.758
And you did just say
you'd do anything for me,

08:27.758 --> 08:29.655
and because you
know how hard it is

08:29.655 --> 08:32.862
for me to stand up for
myself, especially to dad.

08:32.862 --> 08:35.000
Plus, you'd be doing
me a total solid

08:35.000 --> 08:36.965
and I'd owe you forever.

08:36.965 --> 08:40.206
- Yes, you will owe me forever.

08:40.206 --> 08:43.758
- So, does that mean
you're gonna do it?

08:43.758 --> 08:46.344
- On two conditions.
- Okay fine, name it.

08:46.344 --> 08:49.137
- Number one, after
this, you grow a pair

08:49.137 --> 08:51.206
and you stand up to
dad moving forward.

08:51.206 --> 08:52.379
- Mhmm.

08:52.379 --> 08:54.896
- And number two, this is it.

08:55.965 --> 08:57.758
No more switching ever again.

08:57.758 --> 09:00.034
We're way too old
for this foolishness.

09:00.034 --> 09:01.793
- Promise, I swear.

09:01.793 --> 09:03.137
This is just gonna
be for one night

09:03.137 --> 09:05.241
and no one will ever know.

09:06.310 --> 09:07.344
- Fine, deal.

09:08.931 --> 09:11.206
But if we get caught,
Niecy I'm snitchin'.

09:11.206 --> 09:12.241
- [Denise] We won't get caught.

09:13.379 --> 09:14.862

09:19.793 --> 09:21.413
so who's getting
caught doing what?

09:21.413 --> 09:23.068
- That's what you
get for listening in

09:23.068 --> 09:25.137
on folk's conversations.

09:25.137 --> 09:27.034
Denise was just saying
that if we plan it right,

09:27.034 --> 09:28.724
we won't get caught
in the snow tomorrow.

09:28.724 --> 09:30.379
- Snow? I didn't
hear about no snow.

09:30.379 --> 09:32.241
- It was just on the news.

09:32.241 --> 09:34.965
We don't want it to ruin
our dresses for the party.

09:34.965 --> 09:36.379
- How bout that?

09:36.379 --> 09:37.931
- I know, you hate
going to it every year.

09:37.931 --> 09:39.689
- No, I just hate my
mom buying me an outfit

09:39.689 --> 09:41.448
to wear every year.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.103
- I think that's cute.
- I think that's cute.

09:43.103 --> 09:45.758
- This year's party is
gonna be a good time.

09:45.758 --> 09:48.379
Might even have some
unexpected revelations.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.931
- Unexpected revelations, huh,

09:52.034 --> 09:54.689
well in that case, I can't wait.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.206
If you excuse me ladies,
I gotta hit the showers

09:58.206 --> 09:59.413
and turn in.

09:59.413 --> 10:01.206
- Really? So early?

10:01.206 --> 10:02.793
Is everything okay baby?

10:02.793 --> 10:05.068
- Uh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

10:05.068 --> 10:07.413
it's been a long day and
I had a ton of work to do

10:07.413 --> 10:09.068
and I gotta run some
errands tomorrow

10:09.068 --> 10:12.758
and take my mom out to
brunch, so goodnight.

10:12.758 --> 10:14.689
- Okay, well rest well.

10:16.413 --> 10:18.103
- Have a good night.

10:19.310 --> 10:21.896
[tense music]

10:23.724 --> 10:26.103
- Hey, yeah we have a problem.

10:27.965 --> 10:30.275
I just walked in on my girl
and her sister talking,

10:30.275 --> 10:32.379
I think they may be on us, man.

10:32.379 --> 10:34.034
Yeah, look, hold on.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.206
I don't know man,
but I'm terrified.

10:39.206 --> 10:42.827
You swear you haven't
said anything to anybody?

10:42.827 --> 10:45.896
Look man, it's getting
serious around here.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.103
You seen "Snapped"?

10:47.103 --> 10:49.310
That's child's play for my girl.

10:49.310 --> 10:50.310
One second.

10:50.310 --> 10:53.206
[tense music]

10:53.206 --> 10:55.862
Look, things are getting
real around here.

10:55.862 --> 10:57.310
Look, I gotta call you back,

10:57.310 --> 10:58.724
I gotta figure out
this brunch thing.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.241
I'll call you back.

11:00.241 --> 11:02.827
[crowd chattering]

11:02.827 --> 11:05.275
[upbeat music]

11:15.517 --> 11:16.931
Appreciate it.
- Yes.

11:16.931 --> 11:18.275
- So this is it?
- These are it.

11:18.275 --> 11:19.310
- Oh my gosh.

11:20.965 --> 11:22.103
- [Woman] It's been great.

11:22.103 --> 11:23.482
- [kisses] Thanks so much.

11:23.482 --> 11:25.965
- I'm so excited.
- Shall we?

11:25.965 --> 11:27.482
- You ready to order?

11:27.482 --> 11:29.758
- Um, yeah, but those two?

11:33.275 --> 11:35.137
- Oh yeah, they've
been coming in here

11:35.137 --> 11:38.827
for the past few months,
always smiling and whispering.

11:38.827 --> 11:41.310
Never really order
anything besides coffee.

11:41.310 --> 11:42.275
Cute, right?

11:44.793 --> 11:47.758
- That lowdown,
dirty, cheating dog.

11:52.103 --> 11:53.793
[door slams]

11:53.793 --> 11:56.275
- Okay, that's beginning
to be a very bad habit.

11:56.275 --> 11:59.793
- Des, I need to
tell you something.

11:59.793 --> 12:01.517
- How about you tell
me that you brought

12:01.517 --> 12:04.448
everything we need in order
for us to pull off this switch.

12:04.448 --> 12:06.068
- I saw Justin this morning

12:06.068 --> 12:07.517
when I went to the
cafe to get coffee.

12:07.517 --> 12:09.103
- Yeah, okay.

12:09.103 --> 12:12.275
He was meeting his mom, so what?

12:12.275 --> 12:13.896
- Did he make you

12:13.896 --> 12:17.827
in that whole get up
you have on? [chuckles]

12:17.827 --> 12:19.206
- So how upset would you be

12:19.206 --> 12:22.517
if I told you he
wasn't with his mom?

12:22.517 --> 12:24.517
He was with another woman.

12:24.517 --> 12:27.413
- Not at all, it's
probably just a friend.

12:27.413 --> 12:31.000
I have guy friends that I-
- He kissed her.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.379
- He's a dead man.

12:32.379 --> 12:34.275
- Whoa, whoa Des, you
can't go anywhere.

12:34.275 --> 12:37.103
- Niecy, if you don't get
out of my way right now.

12:37.103 --> 12:40.241
- I'm so sorry I had to
be the one to tell you.

12:40.241 --> 12:43.172
- He's gonna be the
one that's sorry.

12:43.172 --> 12:45.896
[sighs] I knew he was
acting strange lately,

12:45.896 --> 12:46.931
but cheating?

12:50.827 --> 12:53.103
- The worst part,
the cashier said

12:53.103 --> 12:54.241
that they'd been
meeting each other there

12:54.241 --> 12:56.344
for the last few months.

12:56.344 --> 13:00.172
- Uh-uh, I don't even
get down like that.

13:00.172 --> 13:01.206
I mean, why?

13:03.620 --> 13:06.586
- You did tell the man you'd
rather be dead than married.

13:06.586 --> 13:09.310
- I never thought that
this could happen.

13:09.310 --> 13:12.275
I love Justin, I
really love Justin.

13:14.068 --> 13:18.137
I'm just not into the
whole marriage foolishness.

13:18.137 --> 13:20.241
Ugh, this is all my fault.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.241
- Des, I completely
understand if you don't want

13:24.241 --> 13:25.896
to do this tonight.

13:26.896 --> 13:28.000
- Yeah, maybe.

13:29.103 --> 13:30.620
No, no, let's do it.

13:32.482 --> 13:34.103
This might actually be the
perfect way to find out

13:34.103 --> 13:37.310
exactly what the
hell is going on.

13:37.310 --> 13:39.344
- Des, no, we have a
plan for you to tell dad

13:39.344 --> 13:41.965
about my new job, and that's it.

13:41.965 --> 13:43.413
- Says you.

13:43.413 --> 13:45.241
Here's our new plan.

13:45.241 --> 13:47.413
I'm gonna have your
big talk with dad,

13:47.413 --> 13:49.068
and you're gonna
find out if Justin

13:49.068 --> 13:51.413
is really cheating
on me, and who with.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.275
Otherwise, I'm out, got it?

13:54.275 --> 13:57.103
- [sighs] Got it.

14:03.689 --> 14:05.413
[festive music]

14:05.413 --> 14:07.241
- Nice of you to join us Jordan.

14:07.241 --> 14:08.620
- Sorry, I got caught up.

14:08.620 --> 14:10.827
- You're only
seven minutes late.

14:10.827 --> 14:13.344
- It's just brunch bro, chill.

14:13.344 --> 14:17.586
- You remind me of your
father, god rest his soul.

14:17.586 --> 14:21.724
However Jordan, you know
how I feel about promptness.

14:21.724 --> 14:23.689
- [All] To be early
is to be on time

14:23.689 --> 14:26.172
and to be one time
is to be late.

14:26.172 --> 14:28.827
- And to be late is
unacceptable, yes mother,

14:28.827 --> 14:32.689
I know but it is
the holidays y'all.

14:32.689 --> 14:35.724
Can y'all just chill
for one day, please.

14:35.724 --> 14:37.724
- You see mother, this is
what I'm talking about.

14:37.724 --> 14:39.344
- Here we go, water boy,

14:39.344 --> 14:40.344
always trying to kiss
up to mom's favor,

14:40.344 --> 14:41.758
stop that please.

14:41.758 --> 14:44.827
- I would slap you, but
that's animal abuse.

14:44.827 --> 14:46.172
- I'ma kick your ass

14:46.172 --> 14:47.448
if you keep messing with me.

14:47.448 --> 14:49.896
- Try it.
- Please boys, enough.

14:49.896 --> 14:54.655
Now listen, I've arranged
for two amazing realtors

14:54.655 --> 14:56.896
to meet with you both next week.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.241
She's gonna show you properties,

14:58.241 --> 15:00.620
now is the best time to buy.

15:00.620 --> 15:02.482
- We discussed this already.

15:02.482 --> 15:03.931
- Yeah, we're grown men,

15:03.931 --> 15:05.827
we do not need you
to run our lives.

15:05.827 --> 15:07.586
Where's the chocolate milk?

15:07.586 --> 15:09.275
Why they don't have
that on the menu?

15:09.275 --> 15:11.620
- I'm not trying
to run your lives,

15:11.620 --> 15:13.310
I'm only trying to help you.

15:13.310 --> 15:14.931
- Mom, I told you,
I want to wait

15:14.931 --> 15:17.793
'til I'm engaged or
married to buy a new place.

15:17.793 --> 15:18.655
- Fine.

15:20.551 --> 15:22.482
Jordan, did you hear

15:22.482 --> 15:24.586
that I offered Denise a
position with our company?

15:24.586 --> 15:27.448
- I did, I think
she's gonna do great.

15:27.448 --> 15:31.620
- That girl wants to be
all up on you all the time.

15:33.482 --> 15:36.241
But that's okay, I'm gonna
keep my good eye on her.

15:36.241 --> 15:37.413
- That's why you hired her?

15:37.413 --> 15:38.896
Keep your good eye on her?

15:38.896 --> 15:42.655
- No, of course not.
She's very talented.

15:42.655 --> 15:45.862
And besides, this will
give me the opportunity

15:45.862 --> 15:49.275
to snag her from our
fierce competition.

15:53.413 --> 15:55.482
You know, [sighs]
eventually you two

15:55.482 --> 15:59.241
will be running the
family business.

15:59.241 --> 16:02.000
And I don't just
want you prepared,

16:04.310 --> 16:08.275
I want the women on your
arm's prepared as well.

16:09.586 --> 16:11.724
You're the only family I have,

16:11.724 --> 16:13.413
not since your dad.

16:13.413 --> 16:14.965
- We know.
- We know.

16:16.586 --> 16:19.965
- So anyway, let's just
chill out and relax

16:19.965 --> 16:22.310
like Jordan said.
- Yes please.

16:22.310 --> 16:23.965
- And order some food.

16:25.827 --> 16:27.482
He's gonna have the
frosted French toast,

16:27.482 --> 16:29.413
and he'll have
the eggs benedict.

16:29.413 --> 16:31.965
- I can't have frosted
anything, I am lactose,

16:31.965 --> 16:34.000
this woman should know
that, she is my mother

16:34.000 --> 16:35.655
if you did not know.

16:35.655 --> 16:37.310
This is my brother
here, he's special,

16:37.310 --> 16:39.482
he'll take a kids menu
and a box of crayons.

16:39.482 --> 16:41.034
- He will have a
bowl of breath mints.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.862
- [Bailey] What I
mentioned, thank you dear.

16:43.862 --> 16:45.482
- [Jordan] You can get
him the kid's menu.

16:45.482 --> 16:46.482
- I was holding my
breath the whole time.

16:46.482 --> 16:47.724
- Come on, stop playing.

16:47.724 --> 16:49.000
- Excuse me, what I said.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.724
Okay, thank you.
- Yes ma'am.

16:50.724 --> 16:53.620
- I'm lactose, I can't
have frosted nothing.

16:53.620 --> 16:55.517
- Coffee please? Black.

16:56.896 --> 16:57.793
- You didn't even
know I was lactose,

16:57.793 --> 16:58.793
I'm your son.

17:01.793 --> 17:05.034
- Just so we're clear, if
we're not successful with this,

17:05.034 --> 17:07.379
our boyfriends will
break up with us.

17:07.379 --> 17:10.620
- And our parents
will disown us.

17:10.620 --> 17:12.068
We're gonna have to be careful

17:12.068 --> 17:15.827
and plan this thing down
to the smallest detail.

17:15.827 --> 17:18.344
- I'm with it, so
let's get to work.

17:18.344 --> 17:19.000
Outfits.

17:20.517 --> 17:21.896
- Check.

17:21.896 --> 17:22.758
- Shoes?

17:24.068 --> 17:25.448
- Check.

17:25.448 --> 17:28.103
- Hair, makeup, and jewelry.

17:28.103 --> 17:29.965
- Check, check, check.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.103
- Operation Merry
Switchmas is going down.

17:34.103 --> 17:34.965
- Yeah.

17:38.862 --> 17:40.862
- So, what do you think?

17:41.758 --> 17:44.034
- Wow, we really did it.

17:44.034 --> 17:45.344
- Yes, we did.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.793
Now, just a couple of reminders

17:48.793 --> 17:50.586
to bring it all home.

17:50.586 --> 17:53.379
Remember, I always scratch-
- Your nose

17:53.379 --> 17:55.103
when you're nervous.

17:55.103 --> 17:57.758
And remember, I always pat-
- Your leg when you

17:57.758 --> 17:59.551
get anxious.

17:59.551 --> 18:00.931
And, you always look around

18:00.931 --> 18:03.103
when you're not
entirely being truthful.

18:03.103 --> 18:04.827
- Both true.

18:04.827 --> 18:06.482
- Here's the thing, mom and dad

18:06.482 --> 18:08.137
are gonna be the
toughest to fool,

18:08.137 --> 18:10.931
but we know their
routine at the party.

18:10.931 --> 18:13.758
So how do we pull
this thing off?

18:16.103 --> 18:18.000
- [Denise] First, we
have to make it past

18:18.000 --> 18:19.620
their usually greeting.
- My beautiful daughters!

18:19.620 --> 18:22.448
- [Desiree] More like
a TSA inspection.

18:27.551 --> 18:28.793
- [Denise] Mom will
look us up and down

18:28.793 --> 18:30.448
making sure we're just perfect

18:30.448 --> 18:31.931
for the Christmas photo.

18:31.931 --> 18:34.482
This will be the hardest part.

18:34.482 --> 18:35.931
- I think now we're
ready for a family photo,

18:35.931 --> 18:36.827
right baby?
- Yes.

18:36.827 --> 18:38.448
- Come on.

18:38.448 --> 18:40.034
- [Desiree] All we
have to do is stay cool

18:40.034 --> 18:42.482
and avoid eye contact.

18:42.482 --> 18:43.931
Once we make it past her,

18:43.931 --> 18:47.448
the rest of the evening
will be piece of cake.

18:47.448 --> 18:49.931
- You guys know the drill.

18:49.931 --> 18:52.482
Desiree on my left,
Denise on my right,

18:52.482 --> 18:53.827
hubby at the end.

18:55.655 --> 18:57.034
- [Denise] After that,
the house will get packed

18:57.034 --> 18:59.586
with glee, which will
work in our favor.

18:59.586 --> 19:01.068
- Here we go.

19:01.068 --> 19:02.724
Let's start with a
little Vogue first,

19:02.724 --> 19:04.586
very Vogue, one,
two, three, Vogue.

19:04.586 --> 19:06.241
- [Denise] We need to
remember the quick routes

19:06.241 --> 19:07.689
in and out of each room

19:07.689 --> 19:09.827
like we did when we were kids.

19:09.827 --> 19:11.689
- [Desiree] We
can use the guests

19:11.689 --> 19:13.724
to help distract them
from our true identities.

19:13.724 --> 19:17.172
We need to always have
our eyes and ears on mom,

19:17.172 --> 19:20.172
dad, and our boyfriends.
[camera shutter clicks]

19:20.172 --> 19:23.206
- Let's act crazy, one,
two, three, reindeer!

19:23.206 --> 19:24.689
[camera shutter clicks]

19:24.689 --> 19:26.586
Last one, a little smize.

19:26.586 --> 19:28.206
Shush, [chuckles] smize for me

19:28.206 --> 19:30.689
one, two, three smize.

19:30.689 --> 19:33.000
[camera shutter clicks]
Wonderful!

19:33.000 --> 19:35.034
- [Desiree] Speaking
of boyfriends,

19:35.034 --> 19:36.655
we need to set some rules.

19:36.655 --> 19:39.103
No sappy looks, no touching,

19:39.103 --> 19:41.034
and definitely no making out.

19:41.034 --> 19:43.034
- [Denise] Absolutely
no making out.

19:43.034 --> 19:45.689
We need to be as
indistinguishable as possible

19:45.689 --> 19:48.931
to everyone,
especially the guys.

19:48.931 --> 19:50.068
What?

19:50.068 --> 19:51.896
- [Desiree] I said no touching.

19:51.896 --> 19:54.517
A hug is touching,
he's seeing me,

19:54.517 --> 19:56.689
not you, remember?

19:56.689 --> 19:57.655
So stop it.

19:59.758 --> 20:01.689
- The party's this way.
- Sure.

20:01.689 --> 20:05.000
[cheerful festive music]

20:08.896 --> 20:10.689
- That reminds me,
we need a clear line

20:10.689 --> 20:12.724
of communication for the party.

20:12.724 --> 20:14.517
- We can each wear an ear pod,

20:14.517 --> 20:16.241
so that way if we need
to make a quick call,

20:16.241 --> 20:18.172
no one can tell we're
actually on the phone.

20:18.172 --> 20:19.862
- Perfect.

20:19.862 --> 20:21.862
- Now in order for this to work,

20:21.862 --> 20:24.551
we need to isolate dad so you
can break the news to him.

20:24.551 --> 20:26.000
- That's nearly impossible.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.103
Mom is always by his
side at the party.

20:28.103 --> 20:30.689
- [Denise] Except when
mom excuses herself

20:30.689 --> 20:32.517
into the kitchen to hide-

20:32.517 --> 20:35.206
- [Both] Aunt Millie's
special fruitcake.

20:35.206 --> 20:37.206
- [Denise] Perfect, that
will give you at least

20:37.206 --> 20:39.724
five minutes to tell
dad about the job.

20:39.724 --> 20:41.034
Can you make that work?

20:41.034 --> 20:43.586
- [Desiree] It's
as good as done.

20:43.586 --> 20:45.068
- [Denise] After you
break the news to dad-

20:45.068 --> 20:46.758
- [Desiree] And after
you find out if Justin

20:46.758 --> 20:48.172
is cheating.

20:48.172 --> 20:49.172
- [Denise] You will
learn if Justin

20:49.172 --> 20:50.620
has truly been faithful.

20:50.620 --> 20:52.068
- [Desiree] And you dear sister,

20:52.068 --> 20:53.896
will be the new lead engineer

20:53.896 --> 20:56.241
for Baxter Enterprises.

20:56.241 --> 20:59.068
- And you will
forever be my hero.

21:04.172 --> 21:05.793
All right, here we go.

21:05.793 --> 21:06.931
- We got this.

21:09.896 --> 21:11.931
- You girls look lovely,

21:11.931 --> 21:14.586
and I will see you at the tree.

21:15.551 --> 21:16.793
- Wait a minute.

21:19.137 --> 21:22.827
[Colleen clears throat]

21:22.827 --> 21:23.724
Hmm.

21:31.137 --> 21:32.000
Girls.

21:33.586 --> 21:36.758
Do you have anything
to say for yourselves.

21:36.758 --> 21:37.896
- Mom.

21:37.896 --> 21:40.000
- [Both] We need to tell you-

21:41.586 --> 21:44.758
- You're welcome, just
a few minor adjustments

21:46.586 --> 21:48.586
and you ladies look
picture perfect.

21:48.586 --> 21:49.241
Let's go.

21:50.655 --> 21:52.103
Honey, we're ready.

21:55.724 --> 21:59.068
Okay Desiree left, Denise right,

21:59.068 --> 22:00.724
I'll be there, okay good.

22:00.724 --> 22:03.241
Okay, Vogue first, and on three,

22:03.241 --> 22:05.862
one, two, three, Vogue.
[camera shutter clicks]

22:05.862 --> 22:08.862
[laughs] Next one,
one, two, three, crazy.

22:08.862 --> 22:12.034
One, two, three, crazy.
[camera shutter clicks]

22:12.034 --> 22:14.000
Last one, smizing,

22:14.000 --> 22:17.137
one, two, three, smize.
[camera shutter clicks]

22:17.137 --> 22:18.965
[laughing] I love you guys,

22:18.965 --> 22:20.275
see you in a bit.

22:24.310 --> 22:26.689
- Okay, I've got the parentals,

22:26.689 --> 22:28.827
you take the guys
when they arrive.

22:28.827 --> 22:32.172
- They should've
been here by now.

22:32.172 --> 22:33.758
What do I until then?

22:33.758 --> 22:35.310
CP time wasn't factored
into the equation.

22:35.310 --> 22:37.896
- Don't panic, that's you.

22:37.896 --> 22:40.379
Just roll with it, that's me.

22:40.379 --> 22:43.068
You're me now, so act like me.

22:43.068 --> 22:45.379
Fun and lively.
- Right.

22:45.379 --> 22:47.310
Fun and lively.

22:47.310 --> 22:49.965
And you, be nerdy and anxious.

22:49.965 --> 22:51.103
- Okay.
- Okay.

22:58.551 --> 23:01.620
Mrs. Baxter, happy holidays,

23:01.620 --> 23:02.896
thanks for coming.
- Sure.

23:02.896 --> 23:04.275
- Justin, hey!

23:04.275 --> 23:06.931
Not in front of everyone silly.

23:10.241 --> 23:12.689
- So did your sister
tell you her good news?

23:12.689 --> 23:16.724
- She did, and I know she's
very excited about it too,

23:16.724 --> 23:18.137
very excited.

23:18.137 --> 23:21.896
- Oh good, I'm excited
to be getting her.

23:21.896 --> 23:24.068
Just the thought of snagging her

23:24.068 --> 23:26.896
right from under
your father, [scoffs]

23:26.896 --> 23:29.068
gives me goosebumps.

23:29.068 --> 23:31.586
Has she broken the
news to him yet?

23:31.586 --> 23:34.137
- Not yet, but
I'm sure she will.

23:35.241 --> 23:38.103
- Well, I hope she does it soon

23:38.103 --> 23:40.586
because I would hate to
have too many holiday drinks

23:40.586 --> 23:43.793
and for it to
accidentally slip out,

23:43.793 --> 23:48.758
you know, before she gets the
chance to tell him. [chuckles]

23:54.793 --> 23:57.000
- Oh great, Bailey's here.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.655
I don't know why
you keep insisting

23:58.655 --> 24:01.206
on inviting that woman
to our party every year.

24:01.206 --> 24:02.827
I just-
- I know she can be

24:02.827 --> 24:05.689
a bit much, but
Bailey's an old friend.

24:05.689 --> 24:07.034
More importantly,
she's the mother

24:07.034 --> 24:08.862
of both our
daughter's boyfriends.

24:08.862 --> 24:11.965
- True, but she is
just so [grumbles].

24:11.965 --> 24:13.137
- Coleen.
- I know, you're right,

24:13.137 --> 24:14.758
you're right, right.

24:14.758 --> 24:16.689
And for the sake
of our daughters,

24:16.689 --> 24:20.655
I will do my best as always
to be gracious and pleasant.

24:20.655 --> 24:22.724
But I'm not making any promises.

24:22.724 --> 24:25.310
- You can do this.
- I can do this.

24:25.310 --> 24:27.241
- Bailey, good to see you,

24:27.241 --> 24:28.689
and both of you.

24:30.310 --> 24:31.793
- Howie, Colleen.

24:34.310 --> 24:36.689
- I brought some champaign
to keep the party going.

24:36.689 --> 24:40.103
- Ah, thank you, that's
very kind of you...

24:41.379 --> 24:43.793
- Justin.
- Of course, Justin.

24:43.793 --> 24:45.310
I'm sorry, you and your brother,

24:45.310 --> 24:47.172
it's as hard to tell
apart as our twins.

24:47.172 --> 24:48.827
- Of course.
- Could you do me a favor

24:48.827 --> 24:50.620
and put those over on
the cocktail table?

24:50.620 --> 24:51.965
- Sure, I guess I'll leave.

24:51.965 --> 24:54.310
- [chuckles] Thank you.

24:54.310 --> 24:57.965
Justin is such a lovely
adult, considering.

24:59.034 --> 25:01.379
- So is Desiree, considering.

25:01.379 --> 25:03.275
- All right, let's
not start ladies.

25:03.275 --> 25:05.034
- Start what Howie?

25:05.034 --> 25:06.793
How long have we been
annoying each other now?

25:06.793 --> 25:09.379
- As long as we've been married.

25:09.379 --> 25:13.448
- Oh no, it's been
way longer than that.

25:13.448 --> 25:18.034
I've known Howard before
you even came along dear.

25:18.034 --> 25:20.689
- The only dear that
I see are the reindeer

25:20.689 --> 25:22.103
on my front lawn.

25:22.103 --> 25:24.862
- [chuckles] Well
if the retinol fits.

25:24.862 --> 25:27.034
- You know what-
- Okay, okay, ladies,

25:27.034 --> 25:29.310
that's enough, please,

25:29.310 --> 25:32.137
no one wants to get on Santa's
naughty list this year.

25:32.137 --> 25:36.034
- Howard. [grumbles]

25:36.034 --> 25:37.862
- Naughty list?

25:37.862 --> 25:38.793
- Bailey...

25:40.241 --> 25:43.068
[Howard chuckles]

25:46.793 --> 25:49.379
- Did you ring the bell baby?

25:49.379 --> 25:52.310
- Actually, I couldn't reach it.

25:52.310 --> 25:54.413
Could I impose on you to do it.

25:54.413 --> 25:57.379
- You can impose on me to
do a whole lot of things

25:57.379 --> 25:59.000
for your fine self.

26:00.448 --> 26:03.275
How about we get
naughty together tonight

26:03.275 --> 26:05.448
and save Santa the trip?

26:05.448 --> 26:08.103
[upbeat music]

26:09.344 --> 26:11.931
[doorbell rings]

26:11.931 --> 26:13.931
- Hello! Come on in.

26:13.931 --> 26:16.862
It's cold out there,
quickly, quickly.

26:16.862 --> 26:19.827
Aunt Mildred, honey
I see that you've met

26:19.827 --> 26:22.862
our new neighbor,
Mr. Terrell Nolan.

26:22.862 --> 26:23.931
- I sure did.

26:26.448 --> 26:28.827
I think he's feeling me,

26:28.827 --> 26:32.137
and if he's single, I
definitely want to feel

26:32.137 --> 26:33.172
all over him.

26:34.275 --> 26:36.103
- Yes, he is single.

26:36.103 --> 26:38.275
But I think he may be
here to meet someone else.

26:38.275 --> 26:41.413
- Uh, who here hotter
than me Colleen?

26:42.758 --> 26:44.172
Who?

26:44.172 --> 26:46.275
- You know what? No
one Aunt Mildred.

26:46.275 --> 26:48.137
- That's right.

26:48.137 --> 26:53.000
Besides, I'm trying to jingle
somebody bells tonight.

26:53.000 --> 26:55.068
Merry Christmas everyone!

26:56.482 --> 26:59.517
- [chuckles] Mr. Nolan,
we are so glad you came.

26:59.517 --> 27:02.034
Please forgive my Aunt Mildred.

27:02.034 --> 27:03.827
- Please, call me Terrell,

27:03.827 --> 27:05.827
and she's harmless.

27:05.827 --> 27:07.931
- Terrell, if only
that were true.

27:07.931 --> 27:09.379
[both chuckling]

27:09.379 --> 27:11.551
- Well I am so glad
to get the invite,

27:11.551 --> 27:14.172
and I'm still trying to
learn all of the neighbors

27:14.172 --> 27:15.827
around here.

27:15.827 --> 27:16.931
- [chuckles] Well
you are in luck

27:16.931 --> 27:18.344
because most of these people

27:18.344 --> 27:20.000
are here tonight.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.586
- Well great, I didn't
know how many guests

27:21.586 --> 27:24.517
you were expecting, so
I brought the whole box.

27:24.517 --> 27:26.931
- Yes, I'm so sorry,
thank you so much.

27:26.931 --> 27:29.068
Now, if you wouldn't mind
putting that over there,

27:29.068 --> 27:30.448
that would be great.
- Okay.

27:30.448 --> 27:32.137
- Thank you so much.

27:34.034 --> 27:36.931
- Honey, I guess you don't
see me standing here.

27:36.931 --> 27:39.206
My arm's gonna fall
off carrying this.

27:39.206 --> 27:42.344
- Let me take that
from you Aunt Mildred.

27:42.344 --> 27:43.344
Yes, so good.

27:45.034 --> 27:48.103
- So good of you to make it.

27:48.103 --> 27:51.827
And Aunt Mildred, it
is always a blessing

27:51.827 --> 27:53.551
to have you here with us.

27:53.551 --> 27:55.551
- Yes, it sure is.

27:55.551 --> 27:56.413
Yes dear.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.241
- Well damn, you
both make it sound

28:00.241 --> 28:02.586
like I should be dead by now.

28:04.241 --> 28:07.275
Be a sugar plum and put
up my favorite fruitcake

28:07.275 --> 28:10.241
until it's time for dessert,

28:10.241 --> 28:13.413
and I added some
extra rum to the dish.

28:13.413 --> 28:14.896
- You shouldn't have.

28:14.896 --> 28:16.896
- You really shouldn't have.

28:16.896 --> 28:20.275
- Oh hub bub, my
mama raised me right.

28:20.275 --> 28:23.896
I never go anywhere
empty handed.

28:23.896 --> 28:26.551
- How lucky for us, Howard?

28:26.551 --> 28:28.034
- Yes, excuse me.

28:29.413 --> 28:31.068
Aunt Mildred please,
allow me the honor

28:31.068 --> 28:33.241
of escorting you to
your favorite chair.

28:33.241 --> 28:34.586
- Of course

28:34.586 --> 28:36.137
- Okay.
[Coleen laughing]

28:36.137 --> 28:38.620
[festive music]

28:46.000 --> 28:46.896
- Whatchu doing?

28:46.896 --> 28:48.034
- Oh! Desiree.

28:49.344 --> 28:51.241
You scared the
mistletoe out of me.

28:51.241 --> 28:54.586
- I'm sorry mom, I came
in here to get Aunt Millie

28:54.586 --> 28:56.965
the virgin?
- Oh god bless you.

28:56.965 --> 28:59.931
Oh honey, and if could put
this awful fruitcake somewhere

28:59.931 --> 29:02.103
while you're at it.
- Okay.

29:05.448 --> 29:07.068
How's right here?

29:07.068 --> 29:07.965
- Perfect.

29:09.517 --> 29:11.965
- All done.
- Thank you baby.

29:13.586 --> 29:16.137
You know, you have always
been my little helper.

29:16.137 --> 29:18.103
- And partner in crime.

29:18.103 --> 29:19.965
- You know what, I'm not
gonna admit this under oath

29:19.965 --> 29:22.724
but I am so glad
you and I are close.

29:22.724 --> 29:25.137
Even though your father and
I do not have favorites.

29:25.137 --> 29:26.379
- Of course not.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.413
- I just feel that
your sister and I

29:29.413 --> 29:32.206
just don't have a
connection like we do.

29:32.206 --> 29:34.068
- Really?

29:34.068 --> 29:35.965
- I've always felt that
she's been disappointed in me

29:35.965 --> 29:38.517
for being a simple
old housewife.

29:40.517 --> 29:44.000
- I don't think she feels
that way at all, mom.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.482
Maybe it just seems like that

29:45.482 --> 29:47.655
because she has more
in common with dad.

29:47.655 --> 29:51.068
- Yeah, she's always
been a career girl

29:51.068 --> 29:52.655
that I've never been.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.482
I think I embarrass her.

29:55.482 --> 29:57.206
Yeah.
- What?

29:57.206 --> 29:58.103
No way mom.

29:59.517 --> 30:01.172
How do you think she
became so orderly

30:01.172 --> 30:03.000
and well functioning?

30:03.000 --> 30:04.482
She learned that from you,

30:04.482 --> 30:07.517
watching you run this household.

30:07.517 --> 30:12.206
I mean, when dad was first
starting his business,

30:12.206 --> 30:14.965
not only did you have
to raise twin girls,

30:14.965 --> 30:16.413
but you acted as
his receptionist

30:16.413 --> 30:18.034
and his accountant.

30:19.482 --> 30:22.482
If anything, I think
Denise is probably

30:22.482 --> 30:25.034
the one that's embarrassed.

30:25.034 --> 30:26.586
She probably feels like
she could never be as good

30:26.586 --> 30:29.379
as you are, managing
so many things,

30:29.379 --> 30:31.551
especially your cooking skills.

30:31.551 --> 30:34.241
- But she's had
everything I've had.

30:34.241 --> 30:36.172
And I just think you
know, she just hasn't

30:36.172 --> 30:38.482
been in a position
to utilize them yet.

30:38.482 --> 30:42.379
- I don't know, you really
think she's had them?

30:42.379 --> 30:43.448
- Absolutely.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.413
Well, maybe not the
cooking skills though.

30:47.413 --> 30:50.241
[Denise chuckling]

30:50.241 --> 30:51.620
Your father and I,

30:53.551 --> 30:56.000
we have the best girls ever.

30:57.379 --> 30:59.103
And I just you know,

31:00.551 --> 31:03.068
in some ways, I just
think that we each got

31:03.068 --> 31:04.448
our very own girl.

31:05.586 --> 31:08.241
Is that a terrible thing to say?

31:08.241 --> 31:09.689
- No mom, it's not.

31:12.586 --> 31:14.655
- Well, as you've
gotten older however,

31:14.655 --> 31:17.413
I want to have the
same relationship

31:17.413 --> 31:19.551
with your sister too.

31:19.551 --> 31:23.275
- I think she would really
love the same thing.

31:23.275 --> 31:24.103
- Really?

31:29.620 --> 31:31.206
When you see Aunt Mildred,

31:31.206 --> 31:32.551
and if she says anything
about not tasting

31:32.551 --> 31:34.586
enough rum, just tell her that

31:34.586 --> 31:36.551
she lost her taste
buds years ago.

31:36.551 --> 31:38.448
- She did?

31:38.448 --> 31:40.137
- No, but she's not gonna
remember that anyway.

31:40.137 --> 31:42.310
[both chuckling]

31:42.310 --> 31:43.379
Thank you darlin'.

31:43.379 --> 31:44.448
- Thanks mom.

31:47.758 --> 31:48.827
- Can you marry me?

31:48.827 --> 31:50.482
Stop saying can.

31:50.482 --> 31:51.655
You can do this.

31:51.655 --> 31:53.655
Oh gosh, I'm so nervous.

31:54.896 --> 31:56.551
Hey, how you doing?

31:58.413 --> 32:00.310
Hey, what was that for?

32:00.310 --> 32:02.689
- No kissing, or touching, or
making out during the party.

32:02.689 --> 32:04.344
- Where is this coming from?

32:04.344 --> 32:06.241
- I just want our
passion to build up

32:06.241 --> 32:08.379
so we can ravage
each other later.

32:08.379 --> 32:10.344
- What is? What?

32:10.344 --> 32:13.827
- Um, I mean, I really
want to smash tonight.

32:13.827 --> 32:15.379
Speaking of smashing,
are you happy

32:15.379 --> 32:17.344
with the way our
relationship is going?

32:17.344 --> 32:18.586
- Well this is an
odd transition,

32:18.586 --> 32:20.620
and a weird thing to ask.

32:20.620 --> 32:22.827
- God damn it, come one.

32:22.827 --> 32:26.758
- One in the random
acts of flyness is this?

32:26.758 --> 32:28.689
- No, I told you
not to wear the suit

32:28.689 --> 32:29.827
that mom bought us.

32:29.827 --> 32:30.965
- Me? You need to change.

32:30.965 --> 32:32.724
I look kinda fresh.

32:32.724 --> 32:34.413
- The fact that you said fresh

32:34.413 --> 32:36.551
makes you look all
the more ridiculous.

32:36.551 --> 32:40.655
Besides, mom said I
look good in it, so.

32:40.655 --> 32:42.862
- Mom said this suit
was made just for me.

32:42.862 --> 32:45.655
- You guys know you
are identical, right?

32:45.655 --> 32:47.413
- We don't.

32:47.413 --> 32:48.827
You're not even
wearing it right.

32:48.827 --> 32:50.827
Look, you gotta pull
this up, pull this down,

32:50.827 --> 32:53.379
wipe the makeup off your face.

32:53.379 --> 32:54.896
We'll be right back.

32:58.551 --> 32:59.551
- We have a problem.

32:59.551 --> 33:01.310
- Damn right we do.

33:01.310 --> 33:02.275
I don't plan on looking
like you all night long.

33:02.275 --> 33:03.827
- Oh?

33:03.827 --> 33:06.620
I gotta tell you something.
- What?

33:10.586 --> 33:12.034
- I kissed Denise.

33:12.034 --> 33:13.862
- What, come again? I
don't think I heard you.

33:13.862 --> 33:15.448
- That wasn't
Desiree I was with,

33:15.448 --> 33:17.068
that was with Denise.

33:17.068 --> 33:18.413
- Are you sure?

33:18.413 --> 33:20.482
- Positive, I know my girl.

33:20.482 --> 33:22.068
Whenever I kiss my girl,
she has that little smirk

33:22.068 --> 33:23.793
at the end, wasn't there.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.965
- Why would they switch?

33:25.965 --> 33:27.655
- I don't know.

33:27.655 --> 33:29.310
- Do you think they
saw you with Melanie

33:29.310 --> 33:30.758
right before brunch?

33:30.758 --> 33:32.586
- I don't see how,
I was super careful

33:32.586 --> 33:34.275
when I met with her.

33:35.758 --> 33:37.448
- Okay, how was she?

33:38.586 --> 33:40.620
- Melanie, she was the best.

33:40.620 --> 33:42.310
I was nervous at first

33:42.310 --> 33:43.896
but she made me feel
real comfortable.

33:43.896 --> 33:47.482
- I know my girl,
she'll take care of you.

33:47.482 --> 33:50.655
[sighs] So you're sure
no one saw you two?

33:50.655 --> 33:51.758
- All I did was give her a hug

33:51.758 --> 33:53.620
and a kiss on the cheek.

33:53.620 --> 33:54.620
- There it is.

33:54.620 --> 33:56.551
Hug, kiss on the cheek.

33:56.551 --> 33:57.517
How much you want to bet
that Desiree followed you

33:57.517 --> 33:59.482
and saw you somehow?

33:59.482 --> 34:00.689
- So you think Desiree knows?

34:00.689 --> 34:01.758
- Crazy Desiree?

34:01.758 --> 34:03.620
Hell yes she knows.

34:03.620 --> 34:07.103
She probably thinks
you're cheating right now.

34:10.379 --> 34:13.137
- That would be awesome.
- Yeah, huh?

34:13.137 --> 34:14.517
Well let's see.

34:14.517 --> 34:15.862
- So here it is.

34:15.862 --> 34:18.000
- This is it?
- Mhmm.

34:18.000 --> 34:18.862
- Sheesh.

34:20.482 --> 34:22.655
Bro, y'all did y'all thing.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.551
Melanie was right,
she is the number one

34:25.551 --> 34:27.413
custom jeweler in Chicago.

34:27.413 --> 34:28.862
Wow.

34:28.862 --> 34:30.620
- Meeting up with
Melanie was a risk

34:30.620 --> 34:33.137
but it totally worked out.

34:33.137 --> 34:34.862
So, what do you think
the girls are up to?

34:34.862 --> 34:36.827
- I have no idea.

34:36.827 --> 34:38.827
But I say we trip them up
a little bit, you know?

34:38.827 --> 34:40.965
Change a couple things
about these suits.

34:40.965 --> 34:42.793
- So I'll be you
and you'll be me?

34:42.793 --> 34:44.000
- Well sort of.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.551
- Bro, I don't know man.

34:47.551 --> 34:48.793
I wanted tonight to be special.

34:48.793 --> 34:50.379
- And it will be, I promise.

34:50.379 --> 34:53.379
But I'm not suggesting
we do the same,

34:53.379 --> 34:56.689
but we should have a little fun.

34:56.689 --> 34:58.448
- Okay.

34:58.448 --> 34:59.586
Okay.

34:59.586 --> 35:01.103
Okay, okay I'm in.

35:01.103 --> 35:02.689
But anything goes wrong,
I'm pulling the plug.

35:02.689 --> 35:04.172
- Agreed.

35:04.172 --> 35:05.655
- All right.
- Cool.

35:05.655 --> 35:07.172
- Give me something.

35:07.172 --> 35:08.758
- You know what, none
of that corny shit man.

35:08.758 --> 35:09.655
- Jordan.

35:13.827 --> 35:15.172
All right, let's do this.

35:15.172 --> 35:16.827
Take these glasses here,

35:16.827 --> 35:19.103
be super careful
with them please.

35:19.103 --> 35:21.137
- You acting like a lame.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.758
- Hey, everything
okay baby girl?

35:28.103 --> 35:29.068
- Baby girl.

35:30.172 --> 35:32.620
Yes dad everything's fine.

35:32.620 --> 35:34.620
I just wanted to tell you-
- Actually, I'm glad

35:34.620 --> 35:36.448
we have a moment to ourselves

35:36.448 --> 35:38.034
'cause there's something
I need to tell you.

35:38.034 --> 35:39.793
- Dad, I really need to tell you

35:39.793 --> 35:41.724
that I've been thinking
about it a lot-

35:41.724 --> 35:44.931
- You know that I love you
and your sister equally.

35:44.931 --> 35:46.620
- Yes dad, I know.

35:46.620 --> 35:48.689
- I'd be lying if I
said you don't hold

35:48.689 --> 35:51.413
a special place in my heart.

35:51.413 --> 35:52.931
- Go on.

35:52.931 --> 35:55.586
- You have brought so
much meaning to my life,

35:55.586 --> 35:57.896
and especially my work.

35:57.896 --> 36:02.034
Following in the
footsteps of dear old dad.

36:02.034 --> 36:06.068
- Well, you know I've always
looked up to you daddy.

36:06.068 --> 36:07.758
- Legacy.

36:07.758 --> 36:09.896
See that's why it's
been so important to me

36:09.896 --> 36:11.000
that you're working with me

36:11.000 --> 36:13.655
in the company that I built.

36:13.655 --> 36:15.862
And I want to show you
all the ins and outs

36:15.862 --> 36:18.068
in the hopes that one
day, you'll take over

36:18.068 --> 36:20.137
the business for yourself.

36:21.275 --> 36:22.965
Now I know that you kids today,

36:22.965 --> 36:24.758
you're used to getting
everything so quickly,

36:24.758 --> 36:26.965
but if you just be patient,

36:28.000 --> 36:29.689
stick with me a few more years

36:29.689 --> 36:32.241
until you grasp every
aspect of the operation

36:32.241 --> 36:34.241
and I'll be able to rest easy

36:34.241 --> 36:38.172
when the time comes to
hand it all over to you.

36:38.172 --> 36:40.517
- What about Desiree?

36:40.517 --> 36:43.896
- Oh come on, you know
how your sister is.

36:45.000 --> 36:47.517
She wants nothing to do with me,

36:47.517 --> 36:50.172
she's never been interested
in the family business.

36:50.172 --> 36:53.689
- I don't think
that's true at all.

36:53.689 --> 36:55.482
Maybe she just felt like
there was never a place

36:55.482 --> 36:56.827
for her with you.

36:58.793 --> 36:59.655
- Maybe.

37:00.724 --> 37:01.793
I don't know.

37:03.965 --> 37:05.275
I'm not creative.

37:07.000 --> 37:08.241
And I've never really felt like

37:08.241 --> 37:10.103
I could relate to her.

37:12.241 --> 37:16.724
- You may be corporate, but
you have creative departments,

37:16.724 --> 37:19.655
like marketing and media.

37:19.655 --> 37:21.241
We all have some
balance of corporate

37:21.241 --> 37:23.827
and creative inside of us.

37:23.827 --> 37:27.862
So maybe you can think of
her in terms like that.

37:29.724 --> 37:33.137
- Yeah, you are absolutely
right Denise, thank you.

37:34.758 --> 37:37.758
Now getting back to
what I was saying.

37:37.758 --> 37:41.206
I appreciate that you have
been working so hard with me

37:41.206 --> 37:45.068
while simultaneously
working on your PhD.

37:45.068 --> 37:46.655
I want you to know
that your efforts

37:46.655 --> 37:48.655
have not gone unnoticed.

37:50.068 --> 37:53.724
And that is why I'm
going to promote you

37:53.724 --> 37:56.724
to Executive Director
of Engineering.

37:56.724 --> 37:57.551
- Really?

37:57.551 --> 37:58.551
- Yes.

37:58.551 --> 38:00.034
- Dad, that's great.

38:00.034 --> 38:02.827
- Look, I'm sorry
I was so excited

38:02.827 --> 38:04.689
I had to go first,
but I didn't forget

38:04.689 --> 38:06.103
that you said you had something

38:06.103 --> 38:07.275
you wanted to share
with me as well,

38:07.275 --> 38:08.620
so what was it?

38:10.103 --> 38:11.793
- Um, you see, well,

38:15.310 --> 38:17.034
what happened was...

38:18.620 --> 38:21.206
I just, [sighs].

38:25.758 --> 38:29.103
I just wanted to say that it's
been great working with you

38:29.103 --> 38:31.965
and getting to know
you even better.

38:31.965 --> 38:34.103
- Aw, thank you baby girl.

38:37.965 --> 38:40.137
Can't wait to tell your
mother the good news.

38:40.137 --> 38:41.379
- No, dad, wait!

38:50.689 --> 38:53.793
- Young man, could
you please be a dear

38:53.793 --> 38:57.758
and pour me a fresh
glass of that eggnog?

38:57.758 --> 39:00.482
[upbeat music]

39:08.206 --> 39:09.034
Mmm.

39:15.551 --> 39:19.517
Yes, time flies when
you're having rum, mmm-mmm.

39:25.172 --> 39:26.517
- There you are!

39:26.517 --> 39:27.827
- Yay! Time to celebrate.

39:27.827 --> 39:31.482
- Don't throw anything
back just yet.

39:31.482 --> 39:33.758
I didn't tell dad.

39:33.758 --> 39:36.000
- What do you mean?
What happened?

39:36.000 --> 39:37.137
- Dad happened.

39:38.137 --> 39:40.000
I'm sorry Niecy I tried.

39:41.068 --> 39:42.724
But he was so nice.

39:44.517 --> 39:46.862
- He's always nice to me.

39:46.862 --> 39:51.034
- Yeah but, he's never
nice to me like that,

39:51.034 --> 39:52.965
and because he
thought I was you,

39:52.965 --> 39:56.137
he was even nice when
he spoke about me.

40:01.551 --> 40:04.965
By the way, he's
giving you a promotion.

40:04.965 --> 40:06.034
- What?

40:06.034 --> 40:07.000
Wait, what?

40:08.793 --> 40:10.827
This is not happening right now.

40:10.827 --> 40:12.689
- It's already happening.

40:12.689 --> 40:15.000
He rushed out to go tell mom.

40:16.551 --> 40:18.517
- None of this is going
according to plan.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.517
First Justin, and now this?

40:20.517 --> 40:23.482
- Justin? What
happened with Justin?

40:27.551 --> 40:31.724
- [sighs] He kinda kissed me.

40:31.724 --> 40:35.034
- Hold up, so the person
cheating on me is you?

40:35.034 --> 40:37.206
- No silly, he kissed you

40:37.206 --> 40:39.137
but obviously, I'm you.

40:40.724 --> 40:42.827
He came from behind
me, spun me around

40:42.827 --> 40:44.965
and then just planted one on me.

40:44.965 --> 40:46.793
I mean, who does
that type of thing?

40:46.793 --> 40:49.655
- My man does that
kind of thing.

40:49.655 --> 40:51.137
So what did you do?

40:52.965 --> 40:54.965
- I sort of smacked him?

40:54.965 --> 40:55.827
- What?

40:56.862 --> 40:57.724
OMG.

40:58.620 --> 41:01.758
[both giggling]

41:01.758 --> 41:04.896
- He and Jordan are
wearing the exact same suit

41:04.896 --> 41:08.758
so now they really look-
- [Both] Identical.

41:08.758 --> 41:11.793
- This is not good.
- Not good at all.

41:13.310 --> 41:14.965
Justin said that
he's not really happy

41:14.965 --> 41:17.137
with the way our, well,

41:17.137 --> 41:19.793
with the way your
relationship is going.

41:19.793 --> 41:21.689
- He said that?

41:21.689 --> 41:23.896
I'm losing my man?

41:23.896 --> 41:26.586
- Damn Des, what
are we gonna do?

41:26.586 --> 41:28.068
You gotta clear
things up with Justin

41:28.068 --> 41:31.758
and I gotta go tell dad
before Miss Baxter does.

41:31.758 --> 41:32.758
- She wouldn't.

41:32.758 --> 41:34.620
- She very much would.

41:35.931 --> 41:37.068
I'm starting to think
this whole thing

41:37.068 --> 41:39.275
may be a big mistake after all.

41:41.758 --> 41:43.655
What am I gonna do?

41:43.655 --> 41:48.034
- Don't look at me, I'm
just as confused as you are.

41:48.034 --> 41:49.206
We better pray.

41:50.862 --> 41:54.172
[angelic choral singing]

41:57.551 --> 42:00.137
[Coleen humming]

42:00.137 --> 42:03.000
- Coleen, lovely
party as always.

42:04.379 --> 42:05.965
- Thank you Bailey,

42:05.965 --> 42:08.206
I'm so glad your
family could join us.

42:08.206 --> 42:09.758
You know, I'm surprised
you didn't have

42:09.758 --> 42:11.793
one of your black tie events

42:11.793 --> 42:13.344
to attend to tonight.

42:13.344 --> 42:16.000
- I did, but I declined.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.965
I wouldn't dare miss
one of Howard's events.

42:18.965 --> 42:21.758
- Mine and Howard's event.

42:21.758 --> 42:24.172
- Of course, Freudian slip.

42:24.172 --> 42:27.758
- You know what? How about I-
- Ladies, how is everyone

42:27.758 --> 42:29.689
enjoying the party?

42:29.689 --> 42:30.827
- Just splendid Howard.

42:30.827 --> 42:32.310
I was just telling your wife

42:32.310 --> 42:34.827
that I wouldn't
dare miss a chance

42:34.827 --> 42:36.965
of all of us being
under the same roof.

42:36.965 --> 42:40.000
- Let me tell you,
Bailey, don't start.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.827
- I'm just saying my boys
are dating your girls,

42:43.827 --> 42:48.103
so it's nice for us to share
family moments together.

42:50.172 --> 42:54.827
- We love your boys, and
they're always welcome here.

42:54.827 --> 42:57.275
- And you know how I
feel about the girls,

42:57.275 --> 42:58.620
I love them too.

42:58.620 --> 43:01.206
Especially that Denise.

43:01.206 --> 43:04.344
Beautiful, intelligent,
and ambitious.

43:05.896 --> 43:07.689
That girl's really going places.

43:07.689 --> 43:09.448
- Yes she is.

43:09.448 --> 43:13.172
Absolutely, one day she will
be CEO of Dodson Industries.

43:13.172 --> 43:15.172
[Bailey scoffs]

43:15.172 --> 43:16.758
- And what's so
funny about that?

43:16.758 --> 43:19.379
- Well is that
your dream or hers?

43:21.103 --> 43:23.275
- Are you implying
that we're forcing

43:23.275 --> 43:24.896
the family business
on our daughter?

43:24.896 --> 43:27.896
- Oh no, I would
never imply that.

43:27.896 --> 43:30.344
But if I'm driving
down your street

43:30.344 --> 43:32.413
and happen to pass your house.

43:32.413 --> 43:35.275
- You pompous-
- Wait, wait,

43:35.275 --> 43:39.896
now Bailey, Coleen and I are
very proud of our daughters,

43:39.896 --> 43:42.103
but we have always
let them be free

43:42.103 --> 43:44.275
to make their own
choices and decisions,

43:44.275 --> 43:47.724
apart from us and
from each other.

43:47.724 --> 43:50.793
Now I don't think the same
could be said about your sons.

43:50.793 --> 43:53.275
- Grown sons that you
insist on still dressing

43:53.275 --> 43:55.344
in matching Christmas outfits.

43:55.344 --> 43:58.931
- I think it's lovely,
and besides, they love it.

43:58.931 --> 44:01.448
- Do they? Or do you love it?

44:01.448 --> 44:04.931
- I have no idea what
you are implying.

44:04.931 --> 44:07.103
- I'm not implying anything,

44:07.103 --> 44:10.310
but if I happen to
drive down your street,

44:10.310 --> 44:12.275
and pass by your house,

44:12.275 --> 44:15.034
I'll be sure to
honk, beep, beep.

44:16.275 --> 44:18.000
[Bailey scoffs]

44:18.000 --> 44:20.827
- Stealing from me
again Howard, I see?

44:20.827 --> 44:21.931
- Oh.

44:21.931 --> 44:24.413
[upbeat music]

44:34.379 --> 44:35.241
- Ladies.

44:36.896 --> 44:38.000
- Gentlemen.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.379
- Desiree you look amazing.

44:40.379 --> 44:41.413
- Thanks.

44:41.413 --> 44:43.000
- Denise, fantastic.

44:44.793 --> 44:46.103
- As do you.

44:46.103 --> 44:48.793
[playful music]

44:54.344 --> 44:57.103
- Mhmm, this eggnog
is the truth.

44:59.310 --> 45:01.344
Already seeing double.

45:03.137 --> 45:04.241
- Why do I feel like I'm stuck

45:04.241 --> 45:07.448
in a "Sister Sister" episode?

45:07.448 --> 45:08.827
Jordan. Jordan?

45:10.137 --> 45:11.000
- Yes baby.

45:12.413 --> 45:15.310
- I'm sure glad you
guys fixed your suits,

45:15.310 --> 45:17.517
now you look like
your usual selves.

45:17.517 --> 45:19.241
- Yeah, you know,
I can't look like

45:19.241 --> 45:20.896
Black Hogwarts over there.

45:20.896 --> 45:21.896
- I don't know what
you're talking about,

45:21.896 --> 45:23.413
my man looks good okay?

45:23.413 --> 45:25.482
And he's wearing the
hell out of that suit.

45:25.482 --> 45:27.000
- Thank you my love.

45:27.000 --> 45:28.310
- Of course baby.

45:30.517 --> 45:33.862
- Don't you all look
handsome together.

45:35.551 --> 45:39.103
Now this is the Christmas
card photo op right here.

45:40.896 --> 45:43.517
Glad I picked those
suits out this morning.

45:43.517 --> 45:45.241
- Well, speaking
of this morning,

45:45.241 --> 45:46.551
where did you go for brunch.

45:46.551 --> 45:48.482
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

45:48.482 --> 45:51.034
- Well we all went to
our favorite little spot,

45:51.034 --> 45:52.482
Dorothy's Cafe.

45:52.482 --> 45:53.827
- Oh, lovely.

45:53.827 --> 45:55.206
And around what time was that?

45:55.206 --> 45:56.034
- Uh, mom.

45:57.586 --> 46:00.206
- Desiree, you and your sister

46:03.137 --> 46:07.206
will go on plenty of
brunch dates with us,

46:07.206 --> 46:09.551
you need not worry about that.

46:11.137 --> 46:13.310
Jordan, let's get the
ladies some of that.

46:13.310 --> 46:14.275
- Of course.

46:16.586 --> 46:19.137
- I'm not worried about it.

46:19.137 --> 46:22.448
[Bailey laughing]

46:22.448 --> 46:25.896
[Justin laughing]

46:25.896 --> 46:27.379
- But he should be.

46:33.931 --> 46:36.448
[playful music]

47:00.413 --> 47:02.517
- Aunt Mildred, now you know

47:02.517 --> 47:05.965
you're not supposed
to have any alcohol.

47:07.862 --> 47:08.827
- Who said?

47:09.965 --> 47:10.827
- I said.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.379
- Colleen, I'm a grown woman

47:17.379 --> 47:21.379
and I can handle a little
taste of champagne.

47:21.379 --> 47:25.448
- [chuckles] Alright, one glass.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.448
But that is it.

47:28.448 --> 47:30.344
You promise me.

47:30.344 --> 47:32.000
Promise me.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
- I promise.

47:34.344 --> 47:36.310
- I'm watching you.

47:36.310 --> 47:38.965
[upbeat music]

47:49.517 --> 47:52.172
- [sighs] I'm having a flashback

47:52.172 --> 47:54.000
of our other fiascos.

47:55.517 --> 47:57.000
The new plan is,

47:59.896 --> 48:01.896
there is no plan.

48:01.896 --> 48:04.586
I mean, I'm a grown woman,

48:04.586 --> 48:06.448
I should be able to look
my father in the eye

48:06.448 --> 48:09.551
and say, "Dad, I am
leaving Dodson Industries

48:09.551 --> 48:11.206
to go to Baxter Enterprises."

48:11.206 --> 48:13.379
- Yes, you should.

48:13.379 --> 48:16.068
- Great, I'm gonna do just that.

48:16.068 --> 48:16.965
- Fabulous.

48:21.896 --> 48:23.172
Three, two, one.

48:26.103 --> 48:27.413
- I can't.

48:27.413 --> 48:29.068
- I knew you couldn't.

48:29.068 --> 48:31.965
- No I can't because
I'm you and you're me.

48:31.965 --> 48:33.448
If I'm gonna do this

48:33.448 --> 48:35.448
than I have to do
it as the real me.

48:35.448 --> 48:38.310
- My girl, look at
you growing a pair.

48:38.310 --> 48:39.586
- I know, right?

48:39.586 --> 48:42.413
It kinda feels liberating.

48:42.413 --> 48:45.965
- Before we switch back,
are you absolutely sure?

48:45.965 --> 48:49.620
Because we can still
pull this thing off.

48:49.620 --> 48:50.517
- I am.

48:52.379 --> 48:54.931
Des, this whole thing has
been way too stressful.

48:54.931 --> 48:57.896
Plus, I really
think I can do it.

48:57.896 --> 48:59.413
- Then let's switch back now.

48:59.413 --> 49:02.275
- Okay, help me
with this zipper.

49:04.482 --> 49:07.482
- Oh sorry, I am not
looking, I am not looking

49:07.482 --> 49:10.034
but peek-a-boo. [chuckles]

49:10.034 --> 49:12.482
- Jordan, what are you doing?

49:12.482 --> 49:14.172
- Is everything okay?

49:14.172 --> 49:16.482
- Um, I just really
need to talk to you.

49:16.482 --> 49:18.275
- Could you just give
us like, 20 minutes?

49:18.275 --> 49:20.103
We'll be right out.

49:20.103 --> 49:22.310
- I'm sorry, but this
really can't wait.

49:22.310 --> 49:23.689
Can you excuse us?

49:33.655 --> 49:35.275
- What's so urgent?

49:35.275 --> 49:38.275
And why are you looking
outside the door?

49:38.275 --> 49:40.310
- I'm just making sure
Desiree can't hear us.

49:40.310 --> 49:43.379
- Oh really, and why is that?

49:43.379 --> 49:46.206
- I know we're twins and we
tell each other everything,

49:46.206 --> 49:48.310
but you gotta promise me
you won't say anything

49:48.310 --> 49:49.965
to your sister.

49:49.965 --> 49:53.137
- I absolutely promise
I will not tell Desiree.

49:53.137 --> 49:57.275
- Okay, I think Justin is
cheating on your sister.

49:59.137 --> 50:01.068
- Come again?

50:01.068 --> 50:05.034
I mean, [clears throat] why
would you think that my love?

50:05.034 --> 50:07.275
- Remember when my mom
asked him about brunch?

50:07.275 --> 50:08.724
- Yes?

50:08.724 --> 50:10.344
- Well, he wasn't with
us the entire time.

50:10.344 --> 50:11.344
- Oh really?

50:12.310 --> 50:14.206
Where was he?

50:14.206 --> 50:17.206
- He met some chick a few
weeks ago, business deal.

50:17.206 --> 50:19.965
But he's with her
every single time,

50:19.965 --> 50:21.379
like, every night.

50:21.379 --> 50:23.000
- And you're just
now telling me?

50:23.000 --> 50:24.137
- I didn't think
it was a big deal,

50:24.137 --> 50:25.551
I thought it was just business.

50:25.551 --> 50:27.482
But now I'm thinking
it's something serious.

50:27.482 --> 50:29.482
- I'm going to kill him.

50:29.482 --> 50:31.379
- Hey look, I get it,

50:31.379 --> 50:34.172
I'm upset with him too,
but no need for violence.

50:34.172 --> 50:35.379
- That's easy for you to say,

50:35.379 --> 50:37.000
he's not cheating on you.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.379
- Nor you, so you
can't say anything.

50:39.379 --> 50:41.482
They'll sort themselves out.

50:41.482 --> 50:44.137
- You're kidding, you think
I'm just gonna stand by

50:44.137 --> 50:47.137
and let your brother
betray my trust?

50:47.137 --> 50:49.137
- Don't you mean
your sister's trust?

50:49.137 --> 50:50.275
- We're identical twins,

50:50.275 --> 50:52.448
our trust is one and the same.

50:52.448 --> 50:55.103
[upbeat music]

50:58.206 --> 51:00.172
- I hate to admit it

51:00.172 --> 51:03.344
but I kinda saw this coming.

51:03.344 --> 51:06.068
- What are you talking about?

51:06.068 --> 51:08.551
- Look at them, they
don't have what we have.

51:08.551 --> 51:10.206
Yes, your sister loves him

51:10.206 --> 51:13.068
but she don't want
a real commitment.

51:13.068 --> 51:15.172
It's best it goes this way.

51:15.172 --> 51:18.551
- That's not true, this
is not best for them.

51:18.551 --> 51:21.379
Desiree is committed to him.

51:21.379 --> 51:23.655
- Yeah, all on her terms.

51:23.655 --> 51:25.448
My brother may act fine with it

51:25.448 --> 51:27.172
but he's a romantic.

51:30.068 --> 51:33.344
Fresh hairline,
handsome, he wants kids,

51:34.689 --> 51:37.137
marriage, the whole shebang.

51:38.551 --> 51:41.103
Your sister thinks
that's kinda whack.

51:41.103 --> 51:43.517
- Not whack, just not for her.

51:44.655 --> 51:46.551
Like a silly fairytale maybe.

51:46.551 --> 51:49.068
- Exactly, like a
silly fairytale.

51:49.068 --> 51:52.241
My brother wants the
happily ever after.

51:52.241 --> 51:54.413
You're right, maybe
I should go tell her.

51:54.413 --> 51:56.137
- No, I'll tell her.

51:57.206 --> 51:59.344
She should hear it from me.

52:02.241 --> 52:05.206
[Justin snickering]

52:07.137 --> 52:10.275
- Glad to hear that business
is going so well for you.

52:10.275 --> 52:12.517
Your company has come
a long way since-

52:12.517 --> 52:16.344
- Since I left yours and
my dearly departed husband

52:16.344 --> 52:18.586
started our own, yes it has.

52:20.448 --> 52:22.344
And I have you to
thank for that.

52:22.344 --> 52:24.206
- No thanks necessary.

52:25.655 --> 52:27.655
- I wasn't actually
thanking you.

52:27.655 --> 52:30.413
You were just the
catalyst for my departure.

52:30.413 --> 52:32.724
- Well, you said you needed
to get out of the boat

52:32.724 --> 52:34.793
and go your own way.

52:34.793 --> 52:37.448
- What else was I
supposed to say?

52:37.448 --> 52:39.586
I'm still in love with you?

52:41.103 --> 52:43.724
Working with you
every day was torture.

52:45.517 --> 52:48.655
- Bailey, our college
years were way behind us.

52:50.448 --> 52:52.448
I had moved on and
married an amazing woman.

52:52.448 --> 52:55.413
You had moved on
and married William.

52:57.275 --> 53:00.137
I know his death has been
extremely difficult for you.

53:00.137 --> 53:02.862
More than you'd like to admit.

53:02.862 --> 53:07.827
But you still have two amazing
sons by him to cherish.

53:07.827 --> 53:10.344
- You've always been
a perfect gentleman,

53:10.344 --> 53:12.448
which makes it even worse.

53:13.517 --> 53:16.689
But yes, we both have moved on.

53:16.689 --> 53:18.793
But I've never forgotten.

53:20.482 --> 53:22.551
- Forgotten what?

53:22.551 --> 53:24.172
- Howard, has your
wife forgotten

53:24.172 --> 53:25.931
that I knew you first?

53:25.931 --> 53:28.862
- How could I with the
constant reminders?

53:28.862 --> 53:30.862
- Colleen honey-
- No, I got it

53:30.862 --> 53:32.482
this time, Howard.

53:33.896 --> 53:36.793
You see, I've allowed my husband

53:36.793 --> 53:38.827
to manage this relationship

53:38.827 --> 53:41.517
because it is his
responsibility to,

53:41.517 --> 53:43.551
but you continue to push.

53:45.517 --> 53:48.827
See, we both tolerate
it because despite that,

53:48.827 --> 53:51.758
we see the good in
you, and your sons,

53:51.758 --> 53:55.137
and all the things
you've accomplished.

53:56.517 --> 54:00.172
But let me make one
thing perfectly clear,

54:00.172 --> 54:03.310
you are the ex-girlfriend
from college,

54:03.310 --> 54:06.517
I am his wife for
the rest of his life.

54:09.241 --> 54:10.241
Are we clear?

54:11.724 --> 54:13.241
- Crystal.

54:13.241 --> 54:13.896
- Great.

54:15.724 --> 54:17.551
Have some more eggnog.

54:20.413 --> 54:23.206
- I would, if you
had better rum.

54:25.862 --> 54:28.310
- Enjoy the party.

54:28.310 --> 54:34.586
[dramatic music]

54:34.586 --> 54:35.793
- Oh hey.
- Hey.

54:37.586 --> 54:39.482
- How are you?
- Good.

54:39.482 --> 54:40.931
- Well I think your sister

54:40.931 --> 54:42.931
is gonna do great
at my mom's company.

54:42.931 --> 54:45.413
- Yeah, she's really
pumped about it

54:45.413 --> 54:49.620
but you know how anxious
she can get about things.

54:49.620 --> 54:51.482
She plans on telling
our dad tonight.

54:51.482 --> 54:52.827
- Tonight?

54:52.827 --> 54:54.931
Wow, that's huge.

54:54.931 --> 54:57.275
I'll say a prayer
for her strength.

54:57.275 --> 54:58.931
- Boy, does she need it

54:58.931 --> 55:00.448
I think she might be
having second thoughts

55:00.448 --> 55:01.965
about the whole thing.

55:01.965 --> 55:03.482
- Second thoughts?

55:03.482 --> 55:04.896
She should, I mean,

55:07.000 --> 55:08.655
you know, I don't
even think my brother

55:08.655 --> 55:10.344
wants her working there.

55:10.344 --> 55:11.689
- Doesn't want
her working there?

55:11.689 --> 55:14.344
- I mean-
- Did he say that?

55:14.344 --> 55:15.827
- Those were not
his exact words,

55:15.827 --> 55:18.689
it was more like, a concern.

55:18.689 --> 55:21.482
How he's going to
manage his mother

55:21.482 --> 55:25.379
and his girlfriend
all at the same place.

55:25.379 --> 55:26.034
- Oh.

55:28.551 --> 55:32.655
I guess I never thought that
it was such a conflict for him.

55:32.655 --> 55:35.344
I thought he loved the idea
of them working together.

55:35.344 --> 55:36.724
- He does, I mean,

55:38.517 --> 55:40.344
how do I know?

55:40.344 --> 55:43.517
Hey, look, whatever
decision she makes,

55:44.620 --> 55:46.068
it will be the right one.

55:46.068 --> 55:49.379
- From your lips to
baby Jesus's ears.

55:50.965 --> 55:54.724
- You know, when people
are ready to change,

55:54.724 --> 55:59.344
they'll change, and they'll
never do until then.

55:59.344 --> 56:00.724
- Sometimes people just
need the right reasons

56:00.724 --> 56:02.758
to change, right?

56:02.758 --> 56:03.965
- True.

56:03.965 --> 56:06.034
You were my reason to change,

56:06.034 --> 56:09.689
to be less selfish, to
make you a priority,

56:11.137 --> 56:13.931
spend all my time only with you.

56:13.931 --> 56:16.448
- And I was totally
worth it, right?

56:16.448 --> 56:20.034
- [laughing] Yes you were.

56:20.034 --> 56:22.896
And I can no longer
pretend being companions

56:22.896 --> 56:24.793
is just okay.

56:24.793 --> 56:25.793
I want more.

56:28.413 --> 56:29.068
- Jordan.

56:32.724 --> 56:34.551
It's time to go.

56:34.551 --> 56:38.413
I've grown tired of
this holiday party.

56:38.413 --> 56:41.620
- I'm not Jordan, I'm Justin.

56:41.620 --> 56:44.931
- Boy, I birthed you,
I know who you are.

56:48.896 --> 56:50.862
- Mom, I'm Justin, see?

56:52.413 --> 56:54.724
- Mrs. Baxter, this
is Justin, see?

56:57.379 --> 56:58.448
- Yeah, mhmm.

57:00.103 --> 57:03.689
I think you had a little
bit too much of the eggnog.

57:03.689 --> 57:05.206
- I had a bit too much of this-

57:05.206 --> 57:06.827
- Yes.
- I don't even know.

57:06.827 --> 57:08.482
- Let's get you a nice
big cup of coffee,

57:08.482 --> 57:09.482
shall we?
- That's just between my,

57:09.482 --> 57:11.620
I know you better keep.

57:11.620 --> 57:13.206
Boy, come on let's
go, I'm tired-

57:13.206 --> 57:15.793
- A naughty nog, a naughty
nog always gets her.

57:15.793 --> 57:17.172
Mom, the cookies
right over here,

57:17.172 --> 57:20.000
let's get you some bread.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.482
- [Crowd] Go Millie, go Millie,

57:22.482 --> 57:25.862
go Millie, go Millie, go Millie,

57:25.862 --> 57:28.137
go Millie, go Millie,

57:28.137 --> 57:30.482
go Millie, go Millie.

57:30.482 --> 57:32.965
[upbeat music]

57:35.862 --> 57:38.206
- Go Millie, go Millie.
- Millie yes!

57:38.206 --> 57:40.379
- Come on Millie, go Millie,

57:40.379 --> 57:42.379
go Millie, go Millie.
- Jingle yourself

57:42.379 --> 57:46.620
right down here, come on
baby, come on. [chuckles]

57:46.620 --> 57:50.000
Okay.
[Millie laughing]

57:52.344 --> 57:58.310
- Whoo, I think I
jingled all the balls

57:59.000 --> 58:01.448
out of here. [laughing]

58:01.448 --> 58:04.413
- I'm so glad you have
the Christmas spirit.

58:04.413 --> 58:07.551
- Yes, actually I think
someone got a little

58:07.551 --> 58:10.000
too into the Christmas spirits.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.517
- Well I think someone
is trying to get

58:12.517 --> 58:14.379
on Mr. Kringle's nice list.

58:14.379 --> 58:18.344
- Yes, actually, I want
to get on Mrs. Kringle's

58:18.344 --> 58:20.896
naughty list.
- Oh Howard, yum.

58:22.413 --> 58:25.586
- You're on my list every year.

58:25.586 --> 58:29.482
And even when I forget
to say it, thank you.

58:29.482 --> 58:31.103
- For what?

58:31.103 --> 58:33.344
- For loving me,
for being my rock.

58:35.034 --> 58:36.931
If you hadn't taken
care of things at home

58:36.931 --> 58:39.068
the way you do, there's
no way I could've gone out

58:39.068 --> 58:42.172
into that crazy world, and
built a successful business.

58:42.172 --> 58:45.275
- You are so welcome my love.

58:45.275 --> 58:48.068
I'm just thankful that I
was able to do what I could

58:48.068 --> 58:50.620
you know, to get you started.

58:50.620 --> 58:53.103
Stay home and raise
our beautiful girls.

58:53.103 --> 58:54.965
- Yes.

58:54.965 --> 58:57.586
- You have provided a
beautiful life for all of us

58:57.586 --> 59:01.068
and I am so proud of
you, and our girls.

59:03.482 --> 59:05.655
- Speaking of our girls.

59:05.655 --> 59:08.413
I miss all of us being
together as a family.

59:08.413 --> 59:09.620
- Yup.

59:09.620 --> 59:11.137
- I'm usually out with Denise

59:11.137 --> 59:13.103
and you're with Desiree,

59:14.482 --> 59:15.448
and actually I have
a confession to make.

59:15.448 --> 59:16.482
- What's that?

59:16.482 --> 59:18.000
- It may not be obvious,

59:18.000 --> 59:21.586
but I secretly favor Denise.

59:22.310 --> 59:23.379
- No, really?

59:24.551 --> 59:26.000
Not obvious at all.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.310
- Oh it's that bad?

59:27.310 --> 59:29.482
[both laughing]

59:29.482 --> 59:32.310
- It's okay baby, I've done
the same thing with Desiree.

59:32.310 --> 59:34.068
But I'm telling you, this year,

59:34.068 --> 59:35.724
all of that is gonna
stop, it's gonna stop.

59:35.724 --> 59:37.517
I'm gonna make amends

59:37.517 --> 59:39.517
and give each of our girls

59:39.517 --> 59:42.137
the equal attention
that they deserve.

59:42.137 --> 59:43.620
- Wow.
- Yeah.

59:43.620 --> 59:45.137
- I decided to the
exact same thing.

59:45.137 --> 59:46.172
- Really?
- Yes.

59:46.172 --> 59:47.586
- Yes.

59:47.586 --> 59:48.655
- Should we go
tell them together?

59:48.655 --> 59:51.000
- No, [chuckles] 'cause I think

59:51.000 --> 59:53.137
this is the very
time that we owe them

59:53.137 --> 59:54.379
one-on-one time.

59:54.379 --> 59:55.310
- I agree.

59:55.310 --> 59:57.068
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

59:57.068 --> 59:59.137
- Good, makes me so happy.
- Me too baby.

59:59.137 --> 1:00:00.620
- Love of my life, come on

1:00:00.620 --> 1:00:01.275
let's go and gets
some cocktails.

1:00:01.275 --> 1:00:02.034
- Yes.

1:00:04.137 --> 1:00:05.000
- Oh.

1:00:07.241 --> 1:00:08.103
Mhmm.

1:00:11.344 --> 1:00:14.655
So, everything went
according to plan on my end,

1:00:14.655 --> 1:00:17.448
I told Denise not to
take the job with mom,

1:00:17.448 --> 1:00:20.068
and your dirty laundry,
what about you?

1:00:20.068 --> 1:00:22.137
- I planted the seed of
cheating with Desiree

1:00:22.137 --> 1:00:24.137
with Denise, and she
totally bought it.

1:00:24.137 --> 1:00:26.068
- Hey man, that's awesome.

1:00:26.068 --> 1:00:29.482
I cannot wait to see their
faces when we bust them.

1:00:29.482 --> 1:00:33.482
Speaking of busting,
mom almost busted us.

1:00:33.482 --> 1:00:35.310
- That's not good man.
- Yeah, relax bro.

1:00:35.310 --> 1:00:37.689
I told her spidey
senses were off

1:00:37.689 --> 1:00:39.551
due to one too many
holiday spirits,

1:00:39.551 --> 1:00:41.413
you know how she gets.

1:00:42.448 --> 1:00:44.068
- I can't relax.

1:00:44.068 --> 1:00:47.068
I'm feeling bad about
this whole thing.

1:00:47.068 --> 1:00:48.172
- Don't do that.

1:00:48.172 --> 1:00:50.310
Now don't do that.

1:00:50.310 --> 1:00:52.275
You know they
started this first.

1:00:52.275 --> 1:00:54.310
We just have to follow
through with it.

1:00:54.310 --> 1:00:57.482
- Yeah but, when I told
her about the cheating,

1:00:57.482 --> 1:00:59.413
she was really hurt.

1:00:59.413 --> 1:01:02.034
I honestly, I know it's just
supposed to be a joke like haha

1:01:02.034 --> 1:01:04.137
but I don't want to
hurt either of them.

1:01:04.137 --> 1:01:05.551
- I don't either.

1:01:05.551 --> 1:01:08.310
But we're almost at
the end of the night.

1:01:08.310 --> 1:01:10.413
They'll come clean, and
then we'll come clean.

1:01:10.413 --> 1:01:11.724
- I hope it's as easy
as you say it is.

1:01:11.724 --> 1:01:13.379
- Bro, this is the big finish.

1:01:13.379 --> 1:01:16.344
All we have to do
is bring it on home.

1:01:18.034 --> 1:01:18.689
- Really.

1:01:20.586 --> 1:01:22.206
- I'ma finish this cookie,

1:01:22.206 --> 1:01:24.379
you want anything?
- No, I'm good.

1:01:31.379 --> 1:01:33.068
- What happened?

1:01:33.068 --> 1:01:35.482
- Justin is seeing someone else.

1:01:35.482 --> 1:01:40.448
Jordan just told me thinking
he was confiding in you.

1:01:41.827 --> 1:01:43.551
- Thinking I was
you, Justin told me

1:01:43.551 --> 1:01:47.172
that he wants to reevaluate
your relationship.

1:01:47.172 --> 1:01:50.379
This officially is
the worst switch ever.

1:01:50.379 --> 1:01:51.689
I'm so sorry sis.

1:01:53.310 --> 1:01:55.655
- It's not your
fault, it's mine.

1:01:57.379 --> 1:02:00.517
He really wants
marriage and a family,

1:02:01.482 --> 1:02:03.620
and I've been so selfish

1:02:03.620 --> 1:02:06.758
thinking only about
what I wanted.

1:02:06.758 --> 1:02:08.620
- Wow.

1:02:08.620 --> 1:02:11.379
I guess all Justin wanted
was a happy ending,

1:02:11.379 --> 1:02:12.586
no pun intended.

1:02:13.793 --> 1:02:15.758
- Let's hurry up and switch

1:02:15.758 --> 1:02:19.206
so I can deal with this
bad news as my true self.

1:02:19.206 --> 1:02:23.241
- And I can finally face
dad as my true self.

1:02:23.241 --> 1:02:25.137
Operation Merry Switchmas.

1:02:25.137 --> 1:02:26.413
- Abort mission.

1:02:30.517 --> 1:02:32.137
- [Both] Mom?

1:02:32.137 --> 1:02:33.620
- I have been looking
for you everywhere.

1:02:33.620 --> 1:02:35.241
What are you two doing?

1:02:35.241 --> 1:02:36.655
- Nothing.

1:02:36.655 --> 1:02:38.758
- I need to speak
to Denise alone.

1:02:38.758 --> 1:02:39.758
- Not again.

1:02:41.379 --> 1:02:42.862
- Niecy, honey why
are you leaving?

1:02:42.862 --> 1:02:44.758
I just said I need
to speak to you.

1:02:44.758 --> 1:02:46.551
- Oh right, silly me.

1:02:48.620 --> 1:02:52.620
I'm sorry, my mind is all
over the place right now.

1:02:52.620 --> 1:02:54.758
Denise, Desiree, you know.

1:02:56.586 --> 1:03:00.517
- Okay, you two have been
acting awfully strange tonight.

1:03:00.517 --> 1:03:01.517
What's going on.

1:03:01.517 --> 1:03:03.172
- [Both] Nothing.

1:03:03.172 --> 1:03:04.551
We're all good.

1:03:04.551 --> 1:03:07.482
- Okay, Des, I need
to speak to her

1:03:07.482 --> 1:03:08.862
for a few minutes please.

1:03:08.862 --> 1:03:11.586
- But we were just
about to, going.

1:03:14.586 --> 1:03:15.586
- Thank you.

1:03:26.827 --> 1:03:28.517
- I'm sorry dad.

1:03:28.517 --> 1:03:32.413
- It's okay, I was just
looking for your mother.

1:03:32.413 --> 1:03:34.551
- Oh, she's in the
bedroom with Denise.

1:03:34.551 --> 1:03:35.551
- Is Denise okay?

1:03:35.551 --> 1:03:37.000
- Yeah, they're fine,

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.586
they just needed a
minute to catch up.

1:03:39.586 --> 1:03:44.586
- Well, when she comes out,

1:03:44.586 --> 1:03:47.344
let her know I'm
looking for her.

1:03:49.517 --> 1:03:54.241
Actually, there's something
I need to say to you.

1:03:54.241 --> 1:03:55.655
- Yeah, what's up?

1:03:56.724 --> 1:03:58.586
- Is everything okay mom?

1:03:58.586 --> 1:04:01.068
- That is a loaded
question tonight.

1:04:01.068 --> 1:04:02.758
No, everything is fine.

1:04:02.758 --> 1:04:06.448
I just, I just need a
moment to talk to you

1:04:06.448 --> 1:04:07.758
for a little bit.

1:04:07.758 --> 1:04:09.310
- Okay.

1:04:09.310 --> 1:04:11.068
- I want to apologize to you.

1:04:11.068 --> 1:04:13.034
- Oh mom, wait a minute.

1:04:14.655 --> 1:04:18.551
Can we maybe have
this talk tomorrow?

1:04:18.551 --> 1:04:20.827
I'm not really feeling like
my usual self right now.

1:04:20.827 --> 1:04:24.724
- Honey please, just let
me get this out okay?

1:04:24.724 --> 1:04:28.413
I have prided myself
on being a great mother

1:04:28.413 --> 1:04:32.068
and a great role model
for the both of you girls.

1:04:32.068 --> 1:04:35.310
But I realize I may
have only been that

1:04:35.310 --> 1:04:36.758
to your sister.

1:04:36.758 --> 1:04:40.034
- No mom, you're
an amazing mother.

1:04:40.034 --> 1:04:41.896
- Honey, if that was true

1:04:41.896 --> 1:04:43.620
you and I would have
the same relationship

1:04:43.620 --> 1:04:45.862
your sister and I have.

1:04:45.862 --> 1:04:47.379
- Why would we?

1:04:47.379 --> 1:04:49.793
Because we're identical twins?

1:04:49.793 --> 1:04:51.586
We may look identical

1:04:51.586 --> 1:04:54.551
but we have different
personalities.

1:04:55.965 --> 1:04:57.896
- I owe you an apology.

1:04:59.448 --> 1:05:00.965
- You know dad, can
this wait 'til tomorrow

1:05:00.965 --> 1:05:03.000
'cause I'm not quite
feeling like myself.

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.517
- No, I need to say this now.

1:05:07.137 --> 1:05:10.034
I've been a terrible father.

1:05:10.034 --> 1:05:11.586
- You've been great dad.

1:05:11.586 --> 1:05:13.586
- Let me finish Desiree.

1:05:14.931 --> 1:05:17.551
Now, I know we've
had our ups and downs

1:05:17.551 --> 1:05:19.482
and we rarely see eye to eye,

1:05:19.482 --> 1:05:21.379
but that doesn't take
away from the fact

1:05:21.379 --> 1:05:22.758
that I love you dearly.

1:05:22.758 --> 1:05:24.655
- I know that.

1:05:24.655 --> 1:05:26.517
I know I'm not as
close to you as Denise

1:05:26.517 --> 1:05:27.793
but it's okay.

1:05:27.793 --> 1:05:29.517
- No, it's not okay.

1:05:30.896 --> 1:05:32.000
I haven't been the
kind of father to you

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:34.655
that I've been to your sister.

1:05:34.655 --> 1:05:38.517
- But I just haven't
embraced your differences.

1:05:39.862 --> 1:05:43.344
You've always been
more of a daddy's girl,

1:05:44.137 --> 1:05:46.655
and I let you be that.

1:05:46.655 --> 1:05:49.034
And that was wrong of me.

1:05:49.034 --> 1:05:52.551
- Mom, I have learned everything

1:05:52.551 --> 1:05:55.655
about being a woman,
a good Christian,

1:05:56.793 --> 1:05:59.344
and overall good
person from you.

1:06:00.586 --> 1:06:01.413
Not dad.

1:06:03.551 --> 1:06:05.586
I look up to you so much,

1:06:06.931 --> 1:06:08.793
I may have always
been dad's favorite

1:06:08.793 --> 1:06:11.586
but mom, you've
always been mine.

1:06:13.448 --> 1:06:15.931
- Dad, I know it's not like
what you and Denise have,

1:06:15.931 --> 1:06:18.827
but I've always
felt loved by you.

1:06:20.103 --> 1:06:22.551
Sure, I may get, I mean she,

1:06:23.931 --> 1:06:26.793
she may get the
best version of you,

1:06:26.793 --> 1:06:30.482
but the version I get
is still pretty great.

1:06:32.103 --> 1:06:34.931
- Desiree, can you
ever forgive me?

1:06:34.931 --> 1:06:36.517
- Of course daddy.

1:06:42.965 --> 1:06:47.448
- Now I may not be as open
and imaginative as you are,

1:06:47.448 --> 1:06:50.000
but I'm willing
to give it a try.

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:51.655
So you willing to
let your old man

1:06:51.655 --> 1:06:52.827
learn some new things?

1:06:52.827 --> 1:06:54.793
- I would love that.

1:06:54.793 --> 1:06:56.448
We can start with
something simple

1:06:56.448 --> 1:06:58.862
like you come with me
to one of my shoots

1:06:58.862 --> 1:07:00.655
and watch me work my magic.

1:07:00.655 --> 1:07:01.551
- Okay.

1:07:02.896 --> 1:07:05.172
- Or, you can allow
me to style you

1:07:05.172 --> 1:07:08.931
for you and mom's upcoming
anniversary party.

1:07:08.931 --> 1:07:11.586
I'm thinking casual daddy chic?

1:07:12.724 --> 1:07:16.000
- Casual daddy chic? [chuckles]

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:19.689
I don't know how
that's gonna turn out

1:07:19.689 --> 1:07:21.827
but I'm willing
to give it a try.

1:07:21.827 --> 1:07:22.724
- Okay.

1:07:27.655 --> 1:07:29.068
- Want to go for
some naughty nog?

1:07:29.068 --> 1:07:31.793
- Yeah, let's do it.
- All right.

1:07:34.000 --> 1:07:35.551
- Really?

1:07:35.551 --> 1:07:36.206
- Really.

1:07:37.517 --> 1:07:39.655
- How did I not know that?

1:07:39.655 --> 1:07:43.000
- Well, I always thought
you already knew.

1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.620
I always tried to
be just like you,

1:07:44.620 --> 1:07:47.551
I just couldn't
really get it right.

1:07:48.896 --> 1:07:50.758
- You don't have
to be just like me,

1:07:50.758 --> 1:07:53.137
you're already better than me.

1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.275
- You say that, but have
you seen me in the kitchen?

1:07:57.275 --> 1:08:00.655
- [chuckles] Yes I have.

1:08:00.655 --> 1:08:04.586
Honey, if cooking is
what you want to learn,

1:08:04.586 --> 1:08:06.724
I'd be more than
happy to teach you.

1:08:06.724 --> 1:08:08.206
- I would love that.

1:08:09.344 --> 1:08:11.896
- Great. [sniffles]

1:08:11.896 --> 1:08:13.551
You and me?

1:08:13.551 --> 1:08:14.965
- Just you and me.

1:08:16.862 --> 1:08:18.241
I love you mom.

1:08:18.241 --> 1:08:19.965
- I love you baby.

1:08:19.965 --> 1:08:22.620
[gentle music]

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:25.620
Thank you.

1:08:25.620 --> 1:08:26.620
- Thank you.

1:08:27.689 --> 1:08:29.241
- Okay, I'll see you downstairs?

1:08:29.241 --> 1:08:30.724
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:08:30.724 --> 1:08:33.896
[gentle serene music]

1:08:39.655 --> 1:08:42.172
[Desiree sighs]

1:08:50.758 --> 1:08:54.068
- Now I know I gave
Colleen my fruitcake.

1:08:54.068 --> 1:08:56.793
[playful music]

1:09:01.034 --> 1:09:04.206
What the hell she do
with my fruitcake?

1:09:07.724 --> 1:09:08.379
Mhmm.

1:09:12.103 --> 1:09:14.310
I know what she did, she must,

1:09:14.310 --> 1:09:18.793
she must be trying to keep
it all for herself again.

1:09:20.137 --> 1:09:22.965
I bet you that heifer
stole my damn wig,

1:09:22.965 --> 1:09:25.793
I bet you she stole my wig.

1:09:25.793 --> 1:09:27.758
I can't find my damn fruitcake

1:09:27.758 --> 1:09:29.896
and she stole my damn wig.

1:09:32.034 --> 1:09:33.793
There's my baby, yes.

1:09:41.206 --> 1:09:44.689
Come to mama. [giggling]

1:09:44.689 --> 1:09:47.172
[playful music]

1:09:50.758 --> 1:09:53.000
Did she put my wig in there?

1:09:56.620 --> 1:09:59.620
[Mildred hiccuping]

1:10:02.241 --> 1:10:04.965
You're pretty, you're so pretty.

1:10:10.620 --> 1:10:11.793
- Aunt Mildred!

1:10:11.793 --> 1:10:14.379
- Aunt Mildred, are you okay?

1:10:14.379 --> 1:10:17.275
[Mildred groaning]

1:10:18.965 --> 1:10:20.758
- Oh Lord, am I dead?

1:10:22.034 --> 1:10:23.896
- No, you're not dead.

1:10:24.965 --> 1:10:27.103
- Well then I guess I'm okay.

1:10:27.103 --> 1:10:29.379
- All right then, let's
get her in the other room.

1:10:29.379 --> 1:10:33.241
- Just wanted a slice
of my fruitcake.

1:10:33.241 --> 1:10:35.275
- All right, here's a
step, here's a step,

1:10:35.275 --> 1:10:36.896
here's a step, one
step, here we go,

1:10:36.896 --> 1:10:38.137
you got one more step.

1:10:38.137 --> 1:10:40.689
There you go, okay come here.

1:10:40.689 --> 1:10:42.000
A few more steps.

1:10:43.103 --> 1:10:43.965
- Get her over to the couch.

1:10:43.965 --> 1:10:44.793
- Okay baby.

1:10:46.241 --> 1:10:47.620
Come on.

1:10:47.620 --> 1:10:49.034
- Aunt Millie, are you okay?

1:10:49.034 --> 1:10:50.000
- Good girl.

1:10:52.413 --> 1:10:53.793
- Thank you baby.

1:10:53.793 --> 1:10:55.379
- I don't understand.

1:10:57.793 --> 1:11:01.068
Why my fruitcake was
put away so high up

1:11:02.034 --> 1:11:03.862
on a shelf.

1:11:03.862 --> 1:11:05.482
- We didn't want
anyone to get to it

1:11:05.482 --> 1:11:08.482
before we were
ready to serve it.

1:11:08.482 --> 1:11:10.793
- Ah, 'cause it's so good.

1:11:11.931 --> 1:11:14.206
- No, because we hate it.

1:11:14.206 --> 1:11:16.137
- Colleen!

1:11:16.137 --> 1:11:19.137
- No, Howard I can't take
one more thing tonight.

1:11:20.931 --> 1:11:24.448
[sighs] Aunt Mildred,
we hate your fruitcake.

1:11:24.448 --> 1:11:26.000
There, I said it.

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:27.413
I can't go one more moment

1:11:27.413 --> 1:11:29.206
pretending about
anything anymore.

1:11:29.206 --> 1:11:32.482
Things have got to
change, starting now.

1:11:33.551 --> 1:11:36.620
Aunt Mildred, no more fruitcake.

1:11:36.620 --> 1:11:38.241
Bailey, where you at?

1:11:38.241 --> 1:11:39.517
No more drama.

1:11:39.517 --> 1:11:42.000
And girls, no more favorites.

1:11:43.517 --> 1:11:45.379
Tonight, this family
is gonna start

1:11:45.379 --> 1:11:47.482
a new tradition.

1:11:47.482 --> 1:11:50.172
A tradition of love,
and honor, and truth

1:11:50.172 --> 1:11:54.172
in all things in our
lives, are we good?

1:11:54.172 --> 1:11:55.103
Mhmm, okay.

1:11:57.172 --> 1:11:59.482
- No, now that's a
tradition I can get behind.

1:11:59.482 --> 1:12:01.241
- Thank you.

1:12:01.241 --> 1:12:03.137
- Everyone, can I have
your attention please.

1:12:03.137 --> 1:12:06.586
Mrs. Dodson, I would like you
join you in that tradition.

1:12:06.586 --> 1:12:08.206
My love.

1:12:08.206 --> 1:12:09.620
- Jordan honey-
- Would you hold this?

1:12:09.620 --> 1:12:11.379
- What are you doing?

1:12:11.379 --> 1:12:13.068
- My love.

1:12:13.068 --> 1:12:15.448
- [Desiree] What is
happening right now?

1:12:15.448 --> 1:12:16.793
- From the moment I saw you,

1:12:16.793 --> 1:12:18.586
I knew that I
would want to spend

1:12:18.586 --> 1:12:20.620
the rest of my life with you.

1:12:20.620 --> 1:12:22.206
Will you marry me?

1:12:25.724 --> 1:12:29.758
- Excuse me, I'm sorry to
break up this wonderful moment

1:12:29.758 --> 1:12:33.068
but you can't propose to her.

1:12:33.068 --> 1:12:35.689
- Babe, I know you don't
believe in marriages

1:12:35.689 --> 1:12:36.793
but your sister does,

1:12:36.793 --> 1:12:38.137
let them have their moment.

1:12:38.137 --> 1:12:39.620
- No, you don't understand.

1:12:39.620 --> 1:12:41.310
- I'm sorry, I think
she had a little bit

1:12:41.310 --> 1:12:43.068
too much to drink tonight.

1:12:43.068 --> 1:12:44.413
[Mildred hiccuping]

1:12:44.413 --> 1:12:47.034
- Who snitched on me?

1:12:48.413 --> 1:12:50.241
Snitches get stitches.

1:12:52.586 --> 1:12:56.517
- He can't propose to her
'cause that's not Denise.

1:12:56.517 --> 1:12:57.620
I'm Denise.

1:12:57.620 --> 1:12:58.517
- What?

1:12:59.827 --> 1:13:02.862
- This party is getting
better and better.

1:13:08.517 --> 1:13:12.137
- You two need to explain
yourselves right now.

1:13:12.137 --> 1:13:12.862
- Mom, dad.

1:13:15.827 --> 1:13:18.172
We didn't think anybody
would know the difference

1:13:18.172 --> 1:13:20.448
and it was only for tonight.

1:13:21.517 --> 1:13:23.310
- So that heart-to-heart.

1:13:23.310 --> 1:13:25.517
- It was really me.

1:13:25.517 --> 1:13:29.689
- And the one I thought
I had with Desiree was?

1:13:29.689 --> 1:13:30.586
- Me.

1:13:32.379 --> 1:13:34.758
- If it helps, we told
each other what you said.

1:13:34.758 --> 1:13:36.344
- [Both] So sweet.

1:13:36.344 --> 1:13:37.655
- No, it doesn't.

1:13:38.758 --> 1:13:41.862
Why would you fool us like that?

1:13:41.862 --> 1:13:43.586
- It was my idea.

1:13:43.586 --> 1:13:45.344
- No, it was my idea.

1:13:47.827 --> 1:13:49.586
- Really Denise?

1:13:49.586 --> 1:13:51.482
- I'm sorry dad.

1:13:51.482 --> 1:13:52.758
That look right there is exactly

1:13:52.758 --> 1:13:55.344
what I was trying to avoid.

1:13:55.344 --> 1:13:58.793
You see, Mrs. Baxter
offered me a position

1:13:58.793 --> 1:14:00.620
to head up her
engineering department.

1:14:00.620 --> 1:14:03.896
- You know-
- But I didn't know

1:14:03.896 --> 1:14:07.206
how to tell dad and
risk breaking his heart

1:14:07.206 --> 1:14:08.758
so I asked Desiree
to switch with me

1:14:08.758 --> 1:14:11.379
so she could tell
you instead dad.

1:14:11.379 --> 1:14:12.758
- And I went along with it

1:14:12.758 --> 1:14:15.620
because I thought Justin
was cheating on me.

1:14:15.620 --> 1:14:17.517
So I asked Denise if she
would try and find out

1:14:17.517 --> 1:14:18.689
if it was true.

1:14:21.379 --> 1:14:23.379
- And what exactly
did you two think

1:14:23.379 --> 1:14:26.344
would come of this
charade of yours?

1:14:28.241 --> 1:14:32.275
- Mrs. Baxter, I love
that you see enough in me

1:14:32.275 --> 1:14:34.862
to manage your
entire department.

1:14:36.413 --> 1:14:38.517
Dad, I know that
you really want me

1:14:38.517 --> 1:14:40.896
to take over the family
business one day.

1:14:40.896 --> 1:14:44.206
And I love that you
trust me that much.

1:14:45.275 --> 1:14:47.517
But my mind is made up.

1:14:47.517 --> 1:14:51.724
- Denise, I know this move
must be very hard for you

1:14:53.793 --> 1:14:57.551
but it is my pleasure
to have you work

1:14:57.551 --> 1:14:59.827
at Baxter Enterprises,

1:14:59.827 --> 1:15:02.931
where you'll be
your very own boss.

1:15:02.931 --> 1:15:05.724
- Thank you so much Mrs. Baxter,

1:15:05.724 --> 1:15:08.000
I'm really glad to hear that.

1:15:12.275 --> 1:15:14.620
Unfortunately, I won't be
able to accept the position.

1:15:14.620 --> 1:15:16.413
- Oh thank you Jesus.

1:15:19.620 --> 1:15:22.620
- I had really good
intentions for this evening,

1:15:22.620 --> 1:15:24.551
but tonight has shown me
that I have a lot more

1:15:24.551 --> 1:15:26.482
growing up to do.

1:15:26.482 --> 1:15:28.000
Before I can be
anyone else's boss,

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:30.586
I have to first become my own.

1:15:31.827 --> 1:15:33.827
- Desiree, do you have anything

1:15:33.827 --> 1:15:36.379
you want to say for yourself?

1:15:36.379 --> 1:15:37.275
- Huh?

1:15:37.275 --> 1:15:37.931
- Desiree.

1:15:39.896 --> 1:15:42.896
- [sighs] Mom, dad,

1:15:44.620 --> 1:15:47.448
I thought a traditional marriage
like yours wasn't for me

1:15:47.448 --> 1:15:49.586
so I fought against it.

1:15:49.586 --> 1:15:53.448
And I fought so hard that
I pushed Justin away.

1:15:54.931 --> 1:15:58.241
I needed to know if I
had lost him for good.

1:15:59.655 --> 1:16:01.655
- I can't believe
the two of you.

1:16:01.655 --> 1:16:03.482
Especially you Denise.

1:16:04.931 --> 1:16:07.379
How can I trust you to
run my company one day

1:16:07.379 --> 1:16:08.827
when I can't even trust you

1:16:08.827 --> 1:16:11.724
to discuss important
business issues with me?

1:16:11.724 --> 1:16:15.827
Your mother and I expect
more of you, both of you.

1:16:16.896 --> 1:16:18.655
Clearly, things need to change.

1:16:18.655 --> 1:16:21.000
- Yeah, like your father said,

1:16:21.000 --> 1:16:22.793
in light of what's
happened tonight,

1:16:22.793 --> 1:16:25.379
things need to change.

1:16:25.379 --> 1:16:27.448
- Mom, dad, I'm so sorry.

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:30.655
I understand if you
no longer want me

1:16:30.655 --> 1:16:31.827
working at the family business,

1:16:31.827 --> 1:16:33.482
I don't deserve to be.

1:16:33.482 --> 1:16:35.413
- And I'm sorry too.

1:16:35.413 --> 1:16:39.000
I never wanted to
betray your trust.

1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:42.689
I take whatever
punishment you see fit.

1:16:42.689 --> 1:16:44.310
- Desiree, Denise,

1:16:46.862 --> 1:16:48.689
I'm extremely disappointed.

1:16:48.689 --> 1:16:49.689
- [Both] Dad.

1:16:49.689 --> 1:16:51.379
- Just let me finish.

1:16:53.655 --> 1:16:57.517
More than anything, I'm
disappointed in myself.

1:16:59.379 --> 1:17:01.689
I created a relationship
where one of my daughters

1:17:01.689 --> 1:17:03.655
is afraid to be honest with me

1:17:03.655 --> 1:17:07.034
and the other feels like
she's second fiddle.

1:17:07.034 --> 1:17:09.000
I love you both equally.

1:17:11.689 --> 1:17:14.448
I'm responsible for all of this.

1:17:14.448 --> 1:17:16.137
I'm sorry that I put
you in a position

1:17:16.137 --> 1:17:19.103
where you felt like
you had to switch.

1:17:19.103 --> 1:17:21.000
- Me too.

1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:23.413
I mean, even though you're
both identical twins,

1:17:23.413 --> 1:17:26.965
you each have your own
individual uniqueness.

1:17:28.793 --> 1:17:31.413
From now on, [sighs]

1:17:31.413 --> 1:17:33.448
we are going to embrace
those differences

1:17:33.448 --> 1:17:35.896
instead of shying away from it.

1:17:37.931 --> 1:17:39.896
- [Both] Thank you guys.

1:17:40.965 --> 1:17:43.068
- Now Denise, there's no place

1:17:43.068 --> 1:17:44.724
I would rather have you working

1:17:44.724 --> 1:17:46.482
than with me at the office.

1:17:46.482 --> 1:17:48.793
But the choice is yours.

1:17:48.793 --> 1:17:50.862
And as for that promotion.

1:17:50.862 --> 1:17:52.793
- Don't worry about it dad.

1:17:52.793 --> 1:17:57.413
I want to earn it back,
along with your trust.

1:17:57.413 --> 1:17:59.413
We're really sorry
for deceiving you,

1:17:59.413 --> 1:18:01.827
and everyone else tonight.

1:18:01.827 --> 1:18:05.965
- We both promise, this
will never happen again.

1:18:05.965 --> 1:18:08.448
- [Both] Never happen again.

1:18:10.103 --> 1:18:12.034
- I think we can all
promise as a family

1:18:12.034 --> 1:18:13.965
that from this day forward,

1:18:13.965 --> 1:18:16.827
we will be our
true selves, okay?

1:18:16.827 --> 1:18:17.827
- Yeah.

1:18:17.827 --> 1:18:19.137
- All right, come here.

1:18:19.137 --> 1:18:22.034
- Thanks dad.
- Love you baby.

1:18:22.034 --> 1:18:23.103
- Thanks mom.

1:18:28.482 --> 1:18:30.724
- Never do that again.
- Okay dad, I'm sorry.

1:18:30.724 --> 1:18:32.137
- You heard that, don't
ever do that again,

1:18:32.137 --> 1:18:35.965
don't ever.
- Okay. [chuckles]

1:18:42.344 --> 1:18:43.482
- Colleen wait.

1:18:44.482 --> 1:18:46.000
Howard, boys, ladies.

1:18:50.517 --> 1:18:53.379
I want you all to hear this too.

1:18:53.379 --> 1:18:55.689
Colleen I owe you an apology.

1:18:57.517 --> 1:19:01.827
I'm sorry for the way
I've been behaving lately.

1:19:01.827 --> 1:19:06.068
After William passed
away, I wasn't prepared

1:19:06.068 --> 1:19:10.034
to deal with his sudden
death, nor being a widow.

1:19:12.103 --> 1:19:13.068
I was alone.

1:19:15.068 --> 1:19:19.586
And there was a void in
the shape of my husband

1:19:19.586 --> 1:19:22.103
that I filled with
snarky remarks

1:19:26.068 --> 1:19:27.586
and endless work.

1:19:30.827 --> 1:19:34.448
And most embarrassingly,
shameless flirting

1:19:35.586 --> 1:19:37.931
with an old college boyfriend.

1:19:41.137 --> 1:19:44.586
And for that, I owe
you both an apology.

1:19:47.068 --> 1:19:48.068
I'm so sorry.

1:19:49.896 --> 1:19:52.068
It will never happen again.

1:19:55.068 --> 1:19:55.931
And boys,

1:19:59.586 --> 1:20:01.896
I owe you an apology as well.

1:20:04.068 --> 1:20:05.517
I miss your dad.

1:20:07.862 --> 1:20:09.965
And you were all I had

1:20:09.965 --> 1:20:13.586
so I thought I had
to hold on to you

1:20:13.586 --> 1:20:15.758
for fear of losing you too.

1:20:17.103 --> 1:20:19.586
But now I know that
that was wrong.

1:20:21.551 --> 1:20:23.379
You two are grown men

1:20:24.448 --> 1:20:26.965
and I need to treat you as such.

1:20:29.103 --> 1:20:32.517
And that changes
right here, right now.

1:20:34.862 --> 1:20:36.862
I love you both so much.

1:20:41.551 --> 1:20:42.965
And lastly Denise,

1:20:45.620 --> 1:20:48.586
I'm so sorry for
using you as a pawn

1:20:48.586 --> 1:20:50.103
against your father.

1:20:51.413 --> 1:20:53.862
You are an exceptional engineer

1:20:55.758 --> 1:20:59.793
and I only wish that I
could have had a chance

1:20:59.793 --> 1:21:03.103
to have you work for
Baxter Enterprises.

1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:07.965
As for you and Desiree,

1:21:09.482 --> 1:21:13.724
I couldn't think of two
lovelier young women

1:21:13.724 --> 1:21:16.586
that I would want
to date my sons.

1:21:20.689 --> 1:21:22.620
That was, I'm so sorry.

1:21:24.000 --> 1:21:27.655
That was a lot to
get out. [chuckles]

1:21:27.655 --> 1:21:29.655
I've been a real maniac.

1:21:31.137 --> 1:21:33.758
Could you all ever forgive me?

1:21:35.137 --> 1:21:38.620
- Bailey, I'd like you
to meet Terrell Nolan.

1:21:40.517 --> 1:21:42.137
New neighbor, he just
moved up the street

1:21:42.137 --> 1:21:43.482
from our house.

1:21:44.827 --> 1:21:46.482
Recently divorced

1:21:46.482 --> 1:21:47.965
and owns his own
medical practice.

1:21:47.965 --> 1:21:50.758
[cheerful music]

1:21:53.931 --> 1:21:57.793
- Well it's a pleasure
to meet you Terrell.

1:21:57.793 --> 1:21:59.965
- The pleasure's all mine.

1:22:06.034 --> 1:22:07.931
- Justin, I'm so sorry.

1:22:11.931 --> 1:22:14.241
I was so against marriage

1:22:14.241 --> 1:22:16.275
but when my sister said
she saw you in the cafe

1:22:16.275 --> 1:22:18.827
kissing another woman, I
thought maybe you found someone

1:22:18.827 --> 1:22:20.275
who wasn't.

1:22:20.275 --> 1:22:22.068
And then when Jordan
got down on one knee

1:22:22.068 --> 1:22:24.862
and proposed to me thinking
I was really Denise,

1:22:24.862 --> 1:22:27.862
I realized, I do
want to be married.

1:22:29.620 --> 1:22:33.724
- That was Melanie, who
specialized in engagement rings.

1:22:33.724 --> 1:22:36.896
I'll ask again,
will you marry me?

1:22:36.896 --> 1:22:38.896
- Duh Jordan, keep up.

1:22:38.896 --> 1:22:40.931
I'm not really Denise remember?

1:22:40.931 --> 1:22:43.206
- [chuckles] Yes, I do remember.

1:22:43.206 --> 1:22:45.862
And I'm not Jordan, I'm Justin.

1:22:46.827 --> 1:22:48.758
- Wait, so if you're him

1:22:49.724 --> 1:22:51.517
and he's you, then...

1:22:53.586 --> 1:22:55.758
But how did you both know?

1:22:55.758 --> 1:22:59.275
- I figured it out after
I kissed your sister.

1:22:59.275 --> 1:23:03.965
So Jordan and I pretended
to switch as well.

1:23:03.965 --> 1:23:06.793
- So you really do know
who you're asking to marry?

1:23:06.793 --> 1:23:10.275
- I do, and I'm about
to ask a third time.

1:23:10.275 --> 1:23:11.896
Will you marry me?

1:23:15.344 --> 1:23:17.310
- Yes, I'll marry you.

1:23:17.310 --> 1:23:19.000
♪ I miss this

1:23:19.000 --> 1:23:21.724
♪ I wish this time
could slow down ♪

1:23:21.724 --> 1:23:23.827
♪ What is it about Christmas

1:23:23.827 --> 1:23:26.068
♪ It's got the whole town

1:23:26.068 --> 1:23:30.275
♪ Looking for a reason
- Jordan.

1:23:30.275 --> 1:23:32.275
I'm so sorry, I
promise I'll never

1:23:32.275 --> 1:23:34.965
do anything like that again.

1:23:34.965 --> 1:23:37.724
- I'll accept that
apology on one condition.

1:23:37.724 --> 1:23:40.034
- Anything, I'll do anything.

1:23:41.758 --> 1:23:44.000
- Denise, will you marry me?

1:23:45.827 --> 1:23:46.724
- What?

1:23:48.793 --> 1:23:50.275
- You know I did not
come all this way

1:23:50.275 --> 1:23:53.827
to watch Aunt Mildred
eat fruitcake.

1:23:53.827 --> 1:23:55.241
Will you?

1:23:55.241 --> 1:23:56.068
- Yes.

1:24:00.689 --> 1:24:02.379
- My babies getting
married, oh my god,

1:24:02.379 --> 1:24:04.793
double wedding.
- Oh it really is

1:24:04.793 --> 1:24:06.413
a merry Christmas.

1:24:06.413 --> 1:24:09.344
- Oh merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas everybody.

1:24:09.344 --> 1:24:10.827
- Oh my gosh yay!

1:24:13.172 --> 1:24:14.344
- Let me see that ring,
get that ring out.

1:24:14.344 --> 1:24:15.275
- Let me see, let me see.

1:24:15.275 --> 1:24:16.137
Oh! Yes.

1:24:18.827 --> 1:24:20.793
Yes, yes, yes, and yes.

1:24:24.655 --> 1:24:25.896
Voila!

1:24:25.896 --> 1:24:27.862
- I'm getting married!

1:24:27.862 --> 1:24:30.896
Congratulations.
- Congratulations sister.

1:24:30.896 --> 1:24:33.068
- Congratulations.

1:24:33.068 --> 1:24:34.655
- Well?

1:24:34.655 --> 1:24:36.137
- We almost lost our parents.

1:24:36.137 --> 1:24:38.034
- And our boyfriends.

1:24:38.034 --> 1:24:40.034
- We still managed to get
the outcomes we wanted

1:24:40.034 --> 1:24:41.689
and keep them all.

1:24:41.689 --> 1:24:43.827
- It definitely
wasn't what we planned

1:24:43.827 --> 1:24:46.344
but it all worked out.

1:24:46.344 --> 1:24:48.206
