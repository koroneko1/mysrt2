00:48.490 --> 00:53.490
You're watching from Rd's app. Enjoy watching

01:02.440 --> 01:04.209
- <i>Da?</i>
- <i>Your cover's blown.</i>

01:04.209 --> 01:06.340
- <i>Go to the embassy now.</i>
- Okay.

01:10.210 --> 01:11.220
<i>Da.</i>

02:08.440 --> 02:09.539
I'm an American citizen.

02:12.880 --> 02:14.380
Is there a problem?

02:25.460 --> 02:27.990
- <i>Madame.</i>
- Call Ambassador Hartman.

02:27.990 --> 02:30.260
- Tell him the code 13.
- Sorry?

02:30.260 --> 02:32.560
I'm a diplomat.
Call him now!

02:32.560 --> 02:33.630
Stay here.

02:58.550 --> 03:01.590
I want you to deliver
a message to your people.

03:04.530 --> 03:05.900
Can you do that for me?

03:09.530 --> 03:10.670
Thank you.

03:26.820 --> 03:28.020
Fuck!

04:06.990 --> 04:09.590
<i>Yeah?
Oh no, I only got three.</i>

04:09.590 --> 04:11.790
There's one spot I haven't
tried though. The market.

04:11.800 --> 04:14.930
A guy I met last night
in the club tipped me off.

04:14.930 --> 04:17.100
Mmm. Sort of
a local playboy.

04:17.100 --> 04:18.470
God knows what to expect,

04:18.470 --> 04:20.130
but it's on the way
to the airport so...

04:20.140 --> 04:21.600
Yeah. Yeah, of course, yeah.

04:21.610 --> 04:22.610
Bye-bye.

05:19.800 --> 05:22.930
Uh, sorry. I don't
speak Russian. English?

05:22.930 --> 05:26.700
English, Chinese, French,
Japanese, whatever you like.

05:26.700 --> 05:28.740
Which one are you
interested in?

05:28.740 --> 05:30.940
Honestly,
I'm interested in you.

05:30.940 --> 05:33.610
I am a scout for a
modeling agency in Paris.

05:33.610 --> 05:36.550
I find the stars of tomorrow.
So would you be interested

05:36.550 --> 05:38.880
in becoming
a model in Paris?

05:38.880 --> 05:40.880
I'm already busy here
in Moscow.

05:40.880 --> 05:41.820
By selling dolls?

05:41.820 --> 05:45.220
No. I'm in the university,
studying biology.

05:45.220 --> 05:48.620
No need to stop.
We have girls at school all the time.

05:48.620 --> 05:49.790
I know nothing
about modeling.

05:49.790 --> 05:51.830
I'm sure
you're a fast leaner.

05:51.830 --> 05:53.600
And anyway, we take
care of everything.

05:53.600 --> 05:56.730
Training, accommodation,
visa, documentation.

05:56.730 --> 06:00.130
- What's your name?
- Anna.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.140
Anna, please,
can you take off

06:02.140 --> 06:04.170
your scarf for me
to see your hair?

06:11.050 --> 06:12.210
Aye.

06:12.220 --> 06:13.680
<i>Magnifique.</i>

06:28.100 --> 06:30.260
Hello, welcome.
May I help you?

06:30.270 --> 06:32.570
- Oh, yeah...
- Anna!

06:32.570 --> 06:34.900
Welcome to Paris.
Welcome to your new home!

06:34.910 --> 06:36.270
- How are you?
- Good.

06:36.270 --> 06:39.940
Here. Let me take this.
So here is the agency.

06:39.940 --> 06:41.780
- How was the flight?
- It was great.

06:41.780 --> 06:43.210
Yeah? Ah, excellent.
I'm glad to hear it.

06:43.210 --> 06:44.410
So let me introduce you.

06:44.410 --> 06:47.250
This is Dorothee, your booker.
Best in the business.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.750
I'll call you later.
Hi, how are you?

06:49.750 --> 06:51.090
It's two in France.

06:51.090 --> 06:52.990
I've already put
your photo out there.

06:52.990 --> 06:55.060
People are going crazy
about you.

06:55.060 --> 06:56.890
The other girls are
really jealous.

06:56.890 --> 06:58.660
- Ta-da! There you go.
- Thanks.

06:58.660 --> 07:01.100
We do have a number of Annas though.
So I added an M.

07:01.100 --> 07:03.600
Anna M. means love in French.
Cheers.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.070
Our new star is in the
house and nobody tells me?

07:06.070 --> 07:07.540
John McKee,
the big boss.

07:07.540 --> 07:08.440
Delighted
to have you with us.

07:08.440 --> 07:10.740
I hear Dorothee will be
looking after you.

07:10.740 --> 07:12.210
I don't know which one
of you got luckier.

07:12.210 --> 07:14.610
- I am!
- All right.

07:14.610 --> 07:16.140
Do you want to visit
your apartment?

07:16.150 --> 07:18.110
Sure.

07:18.110 --> 07:20.180
Welcome to your new home.

07:20.180 --> 07:23.080
Please don't lose the keys.
They cost a fortune, okay?

07:23.090 --> 07:24.150
But first,

07:24.150 --> 07:25.950
most important room,
the kitchen

07:25.960 --> 07:28.990
- with our famous Inge. Hi!
- Yeah. The pissed off Inge.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.930
Thank God for Inge keeping
the place habitable.

07:31.930 --> 07:33.260
This is the dining room

07:33.260 --> 07:35.660
and the salon
with Petra and Sonia.

07:35.670 --> 07:37.330
Hi!

07:37.330 --> 07:39.730
- Thank you, Inge.
- Fuck you, Inge.

07:39.740 --> 07:40.870
They're so funny.

07:40.870 --> 07:43.270
These girls aren't staying.
They're in transit to Tokyo.

07:43.270 --> 07:46.640
I think your room
is over here.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.110
Oopsie. Wrong Anna.

07:48.110 --> 07:49.210
We've so many Anna's

07:49.210 --> 07:50.310
at the agency.

07:50.310 --> 07:53.680
What? I'll call you later.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.590
Closets, closets, closets.
And here is Renata.

07:57.590 --> 07:59.050
- Hey.
- Hi.

07:59.060 --> 08:02.060
Your room
and your bathroom.

08:06.800 --> 08:09.200
- And this is Maude.
- Hi.

08:09.800 --> 08:10.800
Hi.

08:12.340 --> 08:14.100
Anna.

08:14.100 --> 08:17.770
Well, if you need anything,

08:17.770 --> 08:19.540
you know where to find me.

08:20.340 --> 08:21.710
Thank you.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.250
Okay, uh,
let me show you your room.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.080
Ta-da!

08:28.090 --> 08:29.920
It may not be what
you were expecting,

08:29.920 --> 08:31.350
but as you start
booking jobs,

08:31.360 --> 08:33.860
we'll be able to move you
to a place of your own.

08:33.860 --> 08:35.289
The fun really starts
when you're on set.

08:35.289 --> 08:36.789
The address for tomorrow.

08:36.789 --> 08:37.860
Your first shoot.

08:37.860 --> 08:39.360
But I thought
I was gonna learn first.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.000
Yeah, but practice
beats theory.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
We've lined you up with one of the best.
Mario Conti.

08:43.000 --> 08:44.730
You're in great hands.
I gotta go.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.170
Turn that
fucking music off!

08:53.180 --> 08:54.740
It's not a nightclub here.

08:55.680 --> 08:57.380
Hey, hey. I never saw

08:57.380 --> 08:58.380
white so flashy.

08:58.380 --> 09:00.650
Are you trying to burn up
my retinas? Change it!

09:00.650 --> 09:02.420
I'm sorry, sir.

09:02.420 --> 09:03.880
Welcome to middle age.

09:03.890 --> 09:05.690
Oh!

09:05.690 --> 09:09.220
Oh, God!
I'm so sorry, girls, I'm late.

09:09.230 --> 09:11.390
I had to take the metro.
Couldn't find a cab.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.130
How are you, sweetie?

09:14.260 --> 09:16.970
- Oh, my God! What's this?
- It's nothing.

09:16.970 --> 09:20.270
I was just young
and stupid.

09:20.270 --> 09:22.200
Find me someone
who wasn't.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.210
Find something!
Hey, Catherine the Great.

09:25.840 --> 09:27.410
Put that on.

09:27.410 --> 09:29.910
And stop lathering that
shit all over her face.

09:32.950 --> 09:34.850
There you go.

09:34.850 --> 09:37.690
Now that's some actual
fucking music!

09:40.060 --> 09:41.990
Get out.
Get out of my frame.

09:41.990 --> 09:44.900
Okay. Get out.
Now! It's okay?

09:45.930 --> 09:47.390
You done it.

09:47.400 --> 09:49.160
Okay, look at me.

09:49.170 --> 09:52.370
And smile.
Please, relax and smile.

09:52.370 --> 09:55.040
Go. Turn. Turn.

09:55.040 --> 09:58.040
It's so boring. Turn.

09:58.040 --> 10:00.980
Freeze. Okay. Tits out.
Push them out. Push them out.

10:00.980 --> 10:04.420
Push your tits out.
Push them out. Okay.

10:10.720 --> 10:13.160
More emotion!
That's great.

10:25.900 --> 10:28.270
Yeah. Okay.

10:30.140 --> 10:32.980
Yeah!

10:35.380 --> 10:37.810
Yeah. Crazy,
totally crazy.

10:59.240 --> 11:01.370
- Ciao, Anna.
- Ciao, Renata.

11:11.040 --> 11:11.910
What the fuck are you doing
in my room?

11:11.920 --> 11:13.350
You've the biggest
fucking bed.

11:13.350 --> 11:15.080
And my bed
is too small!

11:15.080 --> 11:17.490
- Come on, join us.
- No, thank you.

11:34.340 --> 11:36.240
It's just for tonight.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.180
Move it!
Would you stop it.

11:54.320 --> 11:55.790
Here you go.

11:58.860 --> 12:01.970
Oleg, my friend!
I'm so glad you could make it.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.970
John.

12:03.970 --> 12:05.370
Where have you flown
in from this time?

12:05.370 --> 12:07.400
Oh, you know,
here and there.

12:07.400 --> 12:10.340
International man of mystery.
Come in, come in!

12:10.340 --> 12:12.910
We've gotten some
amazing new talent in.

12:12.910 --> 12:16.010
That's Milena,
the Brazilian we swiped from Elite.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.150
A Latin-American
gold mine.

12:18.150 --> 12:20.220
Who's she,
uh, over there?

12:20.220 --> 12:21.580
Anna M.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.520
She arrived from Moscow
a short time ago.

12:23.520 --> 12:25.020
Want me
to introduce you?

12:25.990 --> 12:28.260
Uh... No.
No, I should rest.

12:28.260 --> 12:30.390
- I'm jetlagged.
- No, no, no. Come on. Come on.

12:30.390 --> 12:33.600
The wallflower act won't wash with me.
You're a partner.

12:33.600 --> 12:35.300
Come meet
your newest employee.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.200
- I'll get you something.
- Thank you.

12:37.200 --> 12:40.900
Anna! Allow me to
introduce Oleg Filenkov.

12:40.900 --> 12:42.300
A compatriot of yours

12:42.300 --> 12:44.000
and one of our
partners in the firm.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.970
- Hi.
- A minor partner.

12:45.980 --> 12:48.980
I'll let you two catch up.
Chat about the old country.

12:58.620 --> 13:00.120
It's a crazy party.

13:01.090 --> 13:02.290
Do you stay in Paris?

13:02.290 --> 13:04.520
No. I have
a place in London,

13:04.530 --> 13:06.890
but I mostly live
in St. Petersburg.

13:06.900 --> 13:08.160
The winter to Europe.

13:08.160 --> 13:09.230
In the spring time,

13:09.230 --> 13:10.970
there's not a city
more beautiful.

13:10.970 --> 13:13.000
I throw a party there
every year

13:13.000 --> 13:14.240
to celebrate
its arrival.

13:14.240 --> 13:15.570
I'd be honored
if you could make it.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.940
But we're in September.

13:18.940 --> 13:20.980
I hear you
book up quickly.

13:20.980 --> 13:23.140
I'm trying to beat the rush.

13:23.150 --> 13:25.180
Yeah. They keep me
very busy here.

13:25.180 --> 13:26.650
Everything moves so fast.

13:26.650 --> 13:31.120
And if I invited you
to dinner,

13:31.120 --> 13:33.220
would that be
considered too fast?

13:41.670 --> 13:42.930
No, no, no, no, no.

13:42.930 --> 13:44.260
- No, no, no.
- What's wrong?

13:44.270 --> 13:47.030
Nothing. It's just...
It still feels so soon.

13:47.040 --> 13:48.270
Can I get more
champagne, please?

13:48.270 --> 13:52.140
Of course, but Anna.
It's been two months.

13:52.140 --> 13:54.010
Almost every day
we've seen each other.

13:54.010 --> 13:55.510
I've loved every minute.

13:55.510 --> 13:58.180
But you kiss me,
you leave me.

13:58.180 --> 14:00.950
You kiss me again.
Am I a toy?

14:00.950 --> 14:03.990
No, of course you're not.
It's just...

14:03.990 --> 14:06.690
I'm sorry to say,
but, um...

14:06.690 --> 14:08.320
I don't wanna be
one of the girls

14:08.320 --> 14:10.360
you're just gonna
throw away.

14:10.360 --> 14:12.090
I invite you
to every function.

14:12.090 --> 14:13.460
Every dinner.

14:13.460 --> 14:15.430
Every night I ask you
out on my arm,

14:15.430 --> 14:19.170
so I can show you off
in front of all of Paris.

14:19.170 --> 14:22.500
What more do I have to say
to convince you?

14:22.510 --> 14:24.540
Thanks. I don't know.

14:24.540 --> 14:26.470
Maybe you can tell me
something more about yourself.

14:27.580 --> 14:28.950
What do you mean?

14:30.150 --> 14:33.680
Like, what is your job?
What do you do?

14:33.680 --> 14:35.350
I'm afraid you're a spy
or something.

14:36.550 --> 14:38.550
Sweetheart,
I've told you

14:38.550 --> 14:41.250
I'm in import, export.
It's boring.

14:41.260 --> 14:44.160
And once in a while I may
step over a legal line or two.

14:45.130 --> 14:46.200
What kind of lines?

14:49.400 --> 14:51.260
There are sanctions
against countries

14:51.270 --> 14:53.230
all around
the world, yes?

14:53.240 --> 14:56.340
Who gets hurt?
The leaders? Never.

14:56.340 --> 14:59.110
It's the people who suffer.
I'm here to help them out.

14:59.110 --> 15:01.610
- How?
- They need food.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.510
Medication. Oil.
Raw materials.

15:03.510 --> 15:04.750
I help provide
these things.

15:04.750 --> 15:06.120
Food and medication?

15:09.080 --> 15:10.450
Occasionally
some weapons.

15:14.790 --> 15:17.520
And since when are weapons
the raw materials?

15:17.530 --> 15:19.460
If they're in the
defense of freedom.

15:22.730 --> 15:24.640
And are there many countries
you help like that?

15:27.370 --> 15:28.570
Syria.

15:29.740 --> 15:32.310
Libya. Somalia.

15:32.310 --> 15:33.540
Okay, stop. Stop.
I don't want to know.

15:33.540 --> 15:34.610
- Chechnya.
- Stop!

15:39.310 --> 15:42.250
I shouldn't be having this
conversation with anyone.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.320
I take serious risks
in doing so.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.220
You want proof, there it is.

15:47.560 --> 15:50.190
My life for your love.

15:58.230 --> 15:59.340
Where is the bathroom?

16:02.100 --> 16:03.240
Give me a minute.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.970
<i>Madame.</i>

22:20.980 --> 22:21.990
America.

22:23.790 --> 22:24.790
Ah!

22:40.640 --> 22:41.800
Three...

22:42.840 --> 22:44.010
<i>Five...</i>

22:44.740 --> 22:45.740
<i>Nine...</i>

22:46.740 --> 22:48.080
Nine...

23:00.220 --> 23:01.430
Huh?

23:19.740 --> 23:20.740
Piotr!

23:50.940 --> 23:52.170
Piotr! Piotr!

24:04.020 --> 24:05.020
Piotr!

24:29.640 --> 24:30.680
Ah! Piotr!

26:04.370 --> 26:05.740
- Piotr.
- Huh?

26:48.920 --> 26:51.220
I understand
you speak English.

26:53.420 --> 26:57.120
You're going to have questions
and I'll answer them.

26:57.130 --> 26:59.060
But first,
I need you to listen.

27:01.130 --> 27:04.260
We all have turning points
in our lives.

27:04.270 --> 27:06.100
Most of the time,
we can't see them

27:06.100 --> 27:09.370
until they're in
our rear-view mirror.

27:09.370 --> 27:12.210
But I'm here to tell you
this is one of those moments.

27:13.740 --> 27:17.310
Every intersection offers
several possibilities.

27:17.310 --> 27:20.750
You just have to pick
the right road.

27:20.750 --> 27:24.290
And sometimes,
those choices have to be made quickly.

27:28.490 --> 27:29.860
Anna.

27:41.270 --> 27:43.070
How do you know
I speak English?

27:44.770 --> 27:46.940
A few days ago,
you filed an application

27:46.940 --> 27:48.280
to enlist in the Navy.

27:49.110 --> 27:50.840
Why?

27:50.850 --> 27:51.810
I'll enlist in anything

27:51.810 --> 27:54.150
that gets me
out of this shitty existence.

27:55.080 --> 27:57.520
Your father was a lieutenant.

27:57.520 --> 28:01.050
But you didn't write that
on your application.

28:01.060 --> 28:04.730
And you were a cadet
at Omsk Military Academy.

28:05.890 --> 28:07.330
But you dropped out at 17.

28:08.300 --> 28:10.530
After my parents died.

28:17.140 --> 28:18.510
It says here you like chess.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.350
I can play.

28:31.920 --> 28:35.020
Your profile interests us.

28:35.020 --> 28:38.290
You have talents and skills
that we can help you develop.

28:38.290 --> 28:41.060
- Like what?
- A sharp mind.

28:41.060 --> 28:43.300
Calm under pressure.

28:43.300 --> 28:46.300
And a certain amount
of anger can be useful.

28:46.300 --> 28:48.470
Mostly though,
you're a blank key,

28:48.470 --> 28:50.000
which means
you have the potential

28:50.010 --> 28:51.070
to open many doors.

28:52.570 --> 28:54.410
You're offering me a job?

28:54.410 --> 28:56.510
I'm offering you
a fresh start.

28:56.510 --> 28:58.110
One year's military training.

28:58.110 --> 28:59.550
Four years
operational in the field.

29:01.050 --> 29:02.090
And when it's done?

29:04.850 --> 29:07.590
Five minutes ago,
you had no future.

29:07.590 --> 29:10.320
Now you want to know
what it holds?

29:10.330 --> 29:12.530
In five years,
you're free to go.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.300
I've seen your face.

29:18.930 --> 29:20.230
It means
I either leave with you

29:20.240 --> 29:21.470
or I don't leave at all.

29:24.570 --> 29:25.980
You see?

29:27.140 --> 29:29.180
I told you,
you had a sharp mind.

29:29.550 --> 29:31.450
No.

29:31.450 --> 29:33.850
I don't like
any of your proposals.

29:43.190 --> 29:45.330
I think you've made
the wrong decision.

29:48.400 --> 29:52.500
You talk about turning points
and choices.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.400
Those are just pretty words.

29:55.370 --> 29:57.140
If it means

29:57.140 --> 29:59.170
it's gonna take me
to another shitty town,

29:59.170 --> 30:01.910
in another shitty box.

30:01.910 --> 30:07.050
You have a right to make your
own choices in your life.

30:07.050 --> 30:11.450
Go here, go there.
Say yes, say no.

30:11.450 --> 30:14.590
But what you can't do
is reject life itself.

30:14.590 --> 30:16.330
Your life was a gift.

30:18.330 --> 30:19.530
Who gave it to you?

30:21.460 --> 30:22.870
My parents.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.030
And this is how
you honor them?

30:28.040 --> 30:30.040
This is what your father
would want for you?

30:31.010 --> 30:32.310
Their lives are over.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.280
But yours isn't.

30:37.080 --> 30:38.610
Have a little faith.

30:38.610 --> 30:40.350
Last time I put
my faith in men,

30:40.350 --> 30:42.020
look where it got me.

30:43.490 --> 30:46.260
Never put your faith
in men, Anna.

30:47.290 --> 30:48.660
Put faith in yourself.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.050
Good.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.140
- How's she doing in there?
- Nervous.

31:36.740 --> 31:38.670
She been pacing at all?

31:38.670 --> 31:41.240
Sitting, mostly.
About an hour.

31:41.240 --> 31:44.380
- She asked for water?
- No.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.410
What about her shoes?
She been playing with them?

31:46.410 --> 31:48.320
Slipping them on and off?

31:49.280 --> 31:50.620
I haven't noticed.

32:07.240 --> 32:08.770
Sorry to have
kept you waiting.

32:08.770 --> 32:10.740
You want a tea
or a coffee?

32:10.740 --> 32:11.770
No, thank you.

32:11.770 --> 32:13.770
Yeah, I'm trying to cut
down on caffeine, myself.

32:13.780 --> 32:16.380
Three o'clock rolls around.

32:16.380 --> 32:18.780
Sorry I didn't
introduce myself.

32:18.780 --> 32:20.280
I'm Agent Leonard Miller.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.220
I'm in Paris
on assignment.

32:22.220 --> 32:23.690
Just helping out
my French colleagues.

32:24.320 --> 32:25.490
I'm nice that way.

32:25.490 --> 32:29.590
So, it's quite the fairy tale
you got going on here, huh?

32:29.590 --> 32:32.320
From a vegetable seller
in Moscow

32:32.330 --> 32:35.660
to a top-flight model in
what, six months?

32:35.660 --> 32:38.500
I sold Matryoshka dolls,
not vegetables.

32:38.500 --> 32:40.670
It's like, um,
a little Russian doll.

32:40.670 --> 32:42.370
Oh, okay.

32:43.570 --> 32:45.470
It's like that story,
<i>The Little Match Girl.</i>

32:45.470 --> 32:46.640
You know that story?

32:46.640 --> 32:49.210
This girl was selling matches
and it's cold and she dies.

32:49.210 --> 32:51.680
I mean,
it's depressing as hell.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.410
But you got out.

32:54.720 --> 32:55.310
<i>What was the
nature of your relationship</i>

32:55.320 --> 32:57.520
<i>with Oleg Filenkov?</i>

32:57.520 --> 32:59.250
He's a partner in the agency

32:59.250 --> 33:02.520
and, um, I bump into him
from time to time.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.800
Was it ever more personal?
Intimate? Sexual?

33:08.200 --> 33:11.630
He flirted with me,
but everybody does.

33:11.630 --> 33:15.200
It must be tedious,
fending off men all the time.

33:15.200 --> 33:18.440
- You get used to it.
- When did you see him last?

33:18.440 --> 33:22.180
- Uh... Last week, I think.
- Mmm-hmm.

33:24.580 --> 33:27.110
Oleg died on Tuesday
the 27th

33:27.120 --> 33:28.650
at the Presidential Suite
at Le Meurice.

33:28.650 --> 33:30.850
It just so happens
that on Tuesday the 27th,

33:30.850 --> 33:34.320
you entered Le Meurice
at precisely 1:37 p.m.

33:34.320 --> 33:37.320
Followed by Mr. Filenkov
at 1:58 p.m.

33:37.330 --> 33:39.390
Sometime between 2:00 p.m.
and 5:00 p.m.,

33:39.390 --> 33:42.200
Oleg and his bodyguards met
the wrong end of a bad day.

33:43.330 --> 33:46.200
You left the hotel
at 2:23. See?

33:46.200 --> 33:47.600
Can you explain that to me?

33:51.570 --> 33:52.740
Um...

33:52.740 --> 33:56.610
I sat at the lounge bar
and I waited for him, but, um,

33:56.610 --> 33:59.180
<i>he never came. Um...</i>

33:59.180 --> 34:01.850
He said he wanted to meet me
for a drink and...

34:04.220 --> 34:05.520
Yeah, I knew
what that meant.

34:05.520 --> 34:07.790
Fucking? I assume
it meant fucking?

34:12.630 --> 34:14.630
You're upset.
I'm sorry.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.270
<i>Thank you.</i>

34:19.270 --> 34:21.370
Did you notice
anything suspicious?

34:21.370 --> 34:23.239
Like what?
Like a huge guy

34:23.239 --> 34:25.170
strolling through a lobby
with a machete?

34:25.170 --> 34:28.679
No, more like a Beretta
92 with a silencer.

34:31.350 --> 34:33.280
Can't you look at the hotel
security cameras?

34:33.280 --> 34:36.650
- Oh, you noticed them?
- They're everywhere.

34:36.650 --> 34:38.150
The tapes were erased.

34:38.889 --> 34:40.360
It's like
we're dealing with pros.

34:43.659 --> 34:47.460
Look, I'm new in town.
I'm working.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.199
Making my living.

34:49.199 --> 34:51.199
I don't wanna
lose it all over this.

34:51.199 --> 34:54.500
I have a girlfriend.
She's very jealous.

34:56.810 --> 34:58.370
And okay, yeah,

34:58.370 --> 35:01.340
maybe I would have slept with
him, but I didn't.

35:02.540 --> 35:04.440
Anyway, it wouldn't be
a crime, would it?

35:04.450 --> 35:05.780
I've never seen
a fashion show.

35:05.780 --> 35:07.510
Must be incredible.

35:07.520 --> 35:09.680
I can get you complimentary
tickets, if you want.

35:10.690 --> 35:13.220
Really?
I'd appreciate that.

35:13.220 --> 35:14.950
I'm in Paris
for a little while.

35:14.960 --> 35:17.360
We should keep in touch.

35:21.300 --> 35:22.330
I'll see you around.

35:37.750 --> 35:39.310
I don't see
what I can do with her.

35:39.310 --> 35:40.810
She has no
higher education.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.690
She's a junkie.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.350
Clean for a year.

35:48.360 --> 35:49.560
And her marks
are excellent.

35:49.560 --> 35:51.690
Whatever the subject.
Look here.

35:53.260 --> 35:54.790
Marksmanship. Acting.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.630
She's beaten
everyone at chess.

35:57.630 --> 35:59.830
Like I can give a shit
if she plays chess!

35:59.830 --> 36:02.970
Tell me she can fix my fucking
heater, then I'll care.

36:03.700 --> 36:06.440
Knives, 100%. Driving.

36:06.970 --> 36:08.110
Hmm.

36:08.110 --> 36:11.380
Oh, but she's not the
profile we're looking for.

36:14.550 --> 36:16.780
Fuckable, I suppose.
Useful as a honey trap.

36:16.780 --> 36:19.550
But beyond that, I can't see
what I can do with her.

36:19.550 --> 36:22.990
KGB needs smart agents
who can size up situations,

36:22.990 --> 36:24.890
react quickly
and appropriately.

36:24.890 --> 36:27.330
I thought we made
our needs perfectly clear.

36:27.330 --> 36:29.960
She has been trained
with that in mind.

36:29.970 --> 36:31.430
Her general knowledge,

36:31.430 --> 36:33.370
her ability to generate
options on the spot.

36:33.370 --> 36:34.970
She's highly intelligent.

36:34.970 --> 36:36.700
"It takes
more than intelligence

36:36.700 --> 36:37.770
"to act intelligently."

36:37.770 --> 36:40.440
Dostoyevsky.

36:40.440 --> 36:43.710
"Like a captive cast to the
bottom of a deep, dry well,

36:43.710 --> 36:46.310
"I know not who I am,
not what awaits me.

36:46.310 --> 36:48.350
"Yes, it's clear to me
that in this cruel

36:48.350 --> 36:50.950
"and obstinate struggle
with Satan,

36:50.950 --> 36:53.050
"I'm fated
to emerge victorious.

36:53.060 --> 36:56.460
"Then mind and matter
shall fuse in perfect harmony.

36:56.460 --> 37:00.260
"And the reign of
universal will shall begin."

37:01.830 --> 37:02.830
Hmm.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.430
Chekhov.

37:05.370 --> 37:08.000
<i>Seagull.</i> Act 1.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.610
- The play within the play.
- Your favorite play.

37:13.610 --> 37:16.450
- How did you know that?
- I work for KGB, baby.

37:17.850 --> 37:19.480
She has not been...

37:22.620 --> 37:23.620
I'll take her.

37:25.020 --> 37:26.720
On trial.

37:28.720 --> 37:30.960
It doesn't work out,
I'll send her home in a body bag.

37:30.960 --> 37:31.960
Deal.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.430
Come.

37:50.110 --> 37:52.010
He'll be at one
of the back tables.

37:53.150 --> 37:54.520
And the gun?

37:56.580 --> 37:57.950
Any bodyguards with him?

37:57.950 --> 37:59.080
How the hell should I know?

37:59.090 --> 38:00.790
You want me
to do the job for you?

38:00.790 --> 38:01.990
No. I can handle it.

38:01.990 --> 38:03.120
When you're done,
grab his phone.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.390
Come out the back door.

38:04.390 --> 38:05.620
We'll be waiting
with the car.

38:05.630 --> 38:06.800
You have five minutes.

40:47.090 --> 40:48.760
Three minutes.

43:01.390 --> 43:03.190
That's five minutes,
let's go.

43:03.190 --> 43:05.720
What about his phone?

43:05.730 --> 43:08.860
- We'll find another way.
- What about her?

43:08.860 --> 43:10.330
If she can't
complete a mission,

43:10.330 --> 43:12.070
I don't care about her.

43:13.170 --> 43:15.200
We should give her
an extra minute.

43:16.070 --> 43:17.240
Why? Why is that?

43:17.240 --> 43:19.040
Because accomplishing
this mission

43:19.040 --> 43:20.910
in five minutes
is impossible.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.380
Adversity is a good teacher.

43:42.930 --> 43:45.130
Well, that's the extra minute.
Come on, let's go.

44:19.230 --> 44:20.240
Here!

44:24.470 --> 44:26.340
I gave you five minutes.

44:26.340 --> 44:28.240
You took five hours.
Well done.

44:29.240 --> 44:30.250
The gun,

44:31.550 --> 44:33.250
it was not even
fucking loaded!

44:34.850 --> 44:36.850
You should have checked
your equipment.

44:38.390 --> 44:39.390
You set me up.

44:45.830 --> 44:47.230
Do you know
why I have a limp?

44:49.460 --> 44:52.330
Come on. You must have
read my file by now.

44:53.430 --> 44:57.140
A minor accident.
In Chechnya.

44:58.170 --> 45:01.010
That's the official version.

45:01.010 --> 45:02.540
The truth is
that during training,

45:02.540 --> 45:05.040
I was dropped in
the Karakan Forest in Siberia.

45:05.050 --> 45:06.950
There are wolves
in the Karakans.

45:06.950 --> 45:10.120
There are also wolf traps,
buried in the snow.

45:10.120 --> 45:13.950
So I dragged a steel jaw
on my leg for three days.

45:13.950 --> 45:15.820
When I finally
got back to the camp,

45:15.820 --> 45:18.860
my instructor
handed me a screwdriver,

45:18.860 --> 45:21.960
and said, "Trouble never
sends a warning."

45:31.370 --> 45:33.040
I'm sorry.

45:33.970 --> 45:35.280
It won't happen again.

45:35.910 --> 45:37.780
No, it won't.

46:01.970 --> 46:05.170
You have 14 days'
prep time. Use it wisely.

46:07.470 --> 46:11.180
Building number three,
11th floor, apartment 25.

46:13.410 --> 46:15.150
Welcome to your new home.

46:16.150 --> 46:17.420
Thank you.

46:55.260 --> 46:57.560
- Hello?
- Settling in?

46:57.560 --> 47:01.460
Yeah. It's another
grey box.

47:01.460 --> 47:03.200
<i>Feels like right back
where I started.</i>

47:03.200 --> 47:05.170
Patience. It's your first day.

47:05.600 --> 47:07.130
I know. I know.

47:10.170 --> 47:13.100
So, uh,
do you want to get dinner?

47:13.110 --> 47:14.440
I'd love to.

47:16.080 --> 47:17.180
And I would love to see you.

47:18.280 --> 47:19.250
Great.

47:19.250 --> 47:21.550
But Olga dumped
a huge pile of work on me.

47:22.250 --> 47:23.250
I have to prep.

47:24.390 --> 47:26.450
Sure.

47:26.450 --> 47:28.950
- Sure, of course.
- You know I would love to...

47:28.960 --> 47:32.120
I know. I know. Study up.

47:32.130 --> 47:33.330
<i>That's what's important.</i>

47:34.560 --> 47:35.660
We'll find another time.

47:36.700 --> 47:38.900
Yeah, another time.

47:49.210 --> 47:51.480
<i>So, you get paid
to look for girls?</i>

47:51.480 --> 47:54.150
That's what I do.
Only nobody pays me.

47:54.150 --> 47:55.680
It's not so easy.

47:55.680 --> 47:58.050
I'm expected to find
five or six girls each trip,

47:58.050 --> 47:59.580
but now I'm struggling.

47:59.590 --> 48:00.720
You're struggling to find

48:00.720 --> 48:02.990
pretty girls in Moscow?

48:02.990 --> 48:04.260
You're doing it wrong,
my friend.

48:04.260 --> 48:05.990
No, I mean,
it's not just pretty.

48:05.990 --> 48:08.290
We look for something unique.
Pearls. Gems.

48:08.300 --> 48:09.560
And six-foot pearls
don't grow on trees.

48:09.560 --> 48:10.600
Not even in Moscow.

48:10.600 --> 48:13.630
Have you tried the market
in Izmailovsky Park?

48:13.630 --> 48:15.130
Izmail...

48:15.140 --> 48:16.330
- Izmailovsky Park.
- Uh-uh.

48:16.340 --> 48:17.740
You want me
to write it down maybe?

48:17.740 --> 48:19.270
- Yeah, please. Yeah.
- Yeah.

48:27.480 --> 48:29.120
He's entering the market.

48:29.120 --> 48:30.520
He'll be with you
in five minutes.

48:30.520 --> 48:32.220
Sure. Copy that.

48:54.580 --> 48:56.510
Uh, sorry.
I don't speak Russian.

48:56.510 --> 48:58.240
<i>She's in contact with him now.</i>

48:58.250 --> 48:59.640
About time.

48:59.650 --> 49:00.650
Go!

49:04.720 --> 49:07.190
Anna M.
means love in French. Cheers!

49:10.160 --> 49:11.590
<i>Da?</i>

49:11.590 --> 49:13.630
- How is it going?
- He's showing her around.

49:13.630 --> 49:15.130
You checked out the agency?

49:15.130 --> 49:16.530
Over the weekend.
Fairly typical.

49:16.530 --> 49:18.530
<i>And you checked
the apartment?</i>

49:18.530 --> 49:21.200
Five girls, all clean enough.
Some drugs, minor records.

49:21.200 --> 49:23.210
Have her call me
when she's settled.

49:31.110 --> 49:33.410
- <i>It's me.</i>
- How's your new life?

49:33.410 --> 49:35.410
If I was living alone,
it would be easier.

49:35.420 --> 49:38.420
You're there to infiltrate,
not take a vacation.

49:38.420 --> 49:41.320
They gave me a new name.
It's Anna M. now.

49:41.320 --> 49:44.260
- M for Moscow?
- <i>What else can it be?</i>

49:44.260 --> 49:49.130
Very original.
So how's your roommates?

49:49.130 --> 49:50.700
Nothing I can't handle.

49:50.700 --> 49:52.400
The French girl
keeps hitting on me.

49:53.170 --> 49:54.000
How's the sex?

49:55.700 --> 49:59.500
- How do you know?
- I work for KGB, baby.

49:59.510 --> 50:02.410
Sex is good.
Wanna know some details?

50:03.850 --> 50:05.580
No. No need to stop.

50:05.580 --> 50:07.210
<i>So you know,
a girl on your arm</i>

50:07.220 --> 50:08.650
<i>can keep the predators away.</i>

50:08.650 --> 50:11.780
Just don't let it get
in the way of your job.

50:11.790 --> 50:15.420
Your target arrives in Paris
next month.

50:15.420 --> 50:17.390
- Be ready.
- <i>I will.</i>

50:24.870 --> 50:25.930
Um...

50:25.930 --> 50:28.200
Maybe I shouldn't be
drinking on an empty stomach.

50:28.200 --> 50:30.140
- I'll get you something.
- Thank you.

50:32.740 --> 50:36.180
Anna! Allow me
to introduce Oleg Filenkov,

50:36.180 --> 50:37.410
a compatriot of yours

50:37.410 --> 50:38.880
and one of our partners
in the firm.

50:38.880 --> 50:40.680
Hi.

50:40.680 --> 50:42.210
<i>It's a crazy party.</i>

50:42.220 --> 50:43.410
<i>Yeah.</i>

50:43.420 --> 50:45.180
<i>So do you live in Paris?</i>

50:45.190 --> 50:46.680
<i>I keep
a place in London.</i>

50:46.690 --> 50:49.220
<i>But I mostly live
in St. Petersburg.</i>

50:49.220 --> 50:50.660
<i>The winter to Europe.</i>

50:57.470 --> 51:00.400
<i>Yeah, once
a long time ago with my aunt.</i>

51:01.840 --> 51:03.600
Don't you have
a better angle than this?

51:03.600 --> 51:04.740
We have three cameras.

51:04.740 --> 51:06.340
I'm not asking
for more cameras!

51:06.340 --> 51:07.670
I'm asking for a better angle!

51:07.680 --> 51:09.310
The hell
with these shit pictures!

51:09.310 --> 51:11.280
Telling me
this is the best technology

51:11.280 --> 51:12.880
Moscow has to offer?

51:12.880 --> 51:15.410
I might as well use
my fucking telescope!

51:21.220 --> 51:23.220
<i>If I invited
you to dinner,</i>

51:23.220 --> 51:24.960
<i>would that be
considered too fast?</i>

51:24.960 --> 51:26.160
Bingo.

52:43.870 --> 52:44.940
<i>Madame.</i>

52:51.510 --> 52:53.220
I'll see you around.

52:56.980 --> 52:58.050
What's he like?

52:58.050 --> 52:59.790
<i>Smart. Handsome.</i>

52:59.790 --> 53:02.550
- <i>A bit of an ass.</i>
- Typical CIA.

53:02.560 --> 53:05.660
- Did he mention the tapes?
- Only that they'd been wiped.

53:05.660 --> 53:07.730
They have the security footage
from across the street

53:07.730 --> 53:09.700
<i>that shows us going in and out
of the hotel.</i>

53:09.700 --> 53:11.330
- And then?
- <i>As I said,</i>

53:11.330 --> 53:14.070
he gave me a light grilling.
Nothing more.

53:14.070 --> 53:15.940
<i>And then he just let you go?</i>

53:17.370 --> 53:20.770
- I'm a good liar.
- Oh, no. No, no.

53:20.780 --> 53:23.340
No, if you'd lied,
he would have known.

53:23.340 --> 53:26.910
- <i>Nothing else about him, then?</i>
- No. Nothing.

53:26.910 --> 53:28.510
Keep out of trouble
'til next Sunday.

53:28.520 --> 53:29.810
You're coming back to Moscow.

53:29.820 --> 53:30.850
For good?

53:32.990 --> 53:35.360
I ask the questions.

54:13.960 --> 54:15.960
- <i>Da?</i>
- It's me.

54:35.720 --> 54:37.050
Pretty nice.

55:24.630 --> 55:28.530
- You plan on keeping her?
- I wanted your opinion.

55:28.540 --> 55:31.940
No family, no attachment
to anybody or anything.

55:31.940 --> 55:33.740
No leverage.

55:33.740 --> 55:35.970
She can turn her back
on us at any time.

55:35.980 --> 55:37.580
She has been well trained.

55:37.580 --> 55:40.110
Some of her choices
are unnecessary.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.780
"Attackers may sometimes
regret bad moves,

55:44.780 --> 55:46.220
"but it is much worse

55:46.220 --> 55:48.550
"to forever regret
an opportunity

55:48.560 --> 55:49.720
"you allowed
to pass you by."

55:49.720 --> 55:51.690
- Lenin?
- Kasparov.

55:57.500 --> 56:00.970
They say you're good at chess.
We should play.

56:02.740 --> 56:04.640
Now, you have questions?

56:07.240 --> 56:08.970
I've nearly
done two years.

56:08.980 --> 56:10.840
One in training,
one on mission.

56:10.850 --> 56:13.540
When my five years are up,
do I have to stay in Moscow?

56:13.550 --> 56:15.110
Or I can go anywhere I want?

56:15.120 --> 56:17.720
What's all this about
"five years," Olga?

56:17.720 --> 56:18.920
With all due respect,

56:18.920 --> 56:21.690
few have lasted five years
in my department.

56:21.690 --> 56:24.560
- Except you.
- Except me.

56:24.560 --> 56:26.560
So what does it
all mean to me?

56:27.860 --> 56:32.260
You work for the KGB
this year, five years, 10.

56:32.270 --> 56:35.570
Be happy and proud
to serve your country.

56:35.570 --> 56:38.500
With respect, I am happy and
proud to serve my country.

56:38.510 --> 56:40.970
I have eliminated 27
targets in two years.

56:40.970 --> 56:42.210
But I've been told that...

56:45.210 --> 56:48.050
There's only one way
to leave the KGB.

56:49.150 --> 56:50.980
Do you want to find out
what it is?

56:52.990 --> 56:54.920
No, sir.

56:54.920 --> 56:56.720
So don't play with me.

57:07.230 --> 57:08.840
Except chess.

57:10.910 --> 57:12.470
Would you fancy a game?

57:13.970 --> 57:15.780
Maybe another day.

57:18.240 --> 57:19.550
Good.

57:25.890 --> 57:27.150
Ta-da!

57:27.150 --> 57:29.260
- Hi.
- Come in. Come in. Come in!

57:31.660 --> 57:33.090
Hi, baby.

57:33.090 --> 57:35.330
I've been preparing this
place for a week now.

57:35.330 --> 57:36.790
This is the kitchen.

57:36.800 --> 57:39.130
Plenty of Russian
food for you.

57:39.130 --> 57:42.070
This is the salon.
And the most important room...

57:45.310 --> 57:48.740
The bedroom. Come on,
come on, come on.

57:48.740 --> 57:53.250
You see, we book the gigs,
we make the money,

57:53.250 --> 57:55.010
and now we got
our own apartment

57:55.010 --> 57:56.310
just like Dorothee
promised.

57:56.320 --> 58:00.050
And it's all ours!
We can sleep where we want.

58:00.050 --> 58:04.160
We can eat where we want.
And we can...

58:05.060 --> 58:07.090
screw where we want.

58:07.090 --> 58:11.230
So what you want to
have first? Lunch or sex?

58:11.230 --> 58:13.000
Actually,
I wanna go for a walk.

58:13.700 --> 58:14.770
In the rain?

58:17.340 --> 58:18.870
It will stop.

58:23.110 --> 58:24.140
What's wrong?

58:25.310 --> 58:27.140
Nothing.

58:27.150 --> 58:29.880
Just didn't really
have much time

58:29.880 --> 58:32.550
to recharge, to be alone.

58:37.090 --> 58:38.830
How was the week
with your family?

58:41.200 --> 58:42.760
Intense.

58:45.260 --> 58:47.370
I get it.

58:47.370 --> 58:51.140
You go for your walk.
I'm gonna make some dinner.

58:51.140 --> 58:54.740
And, uh, you just come back
with some wine.

58:54.740 --> 58:57.340
- How about that?
- Sure.

58:57.340 --> 58:58.880
All right, then.

59:24.440 --> 59:26.640
- <i>Da?</i>
- <i>Hi.</i>

59:26.940 --> 59:28.310
Hold on.

59:31.780 --> 59:34.810
Anna, what is this number?
Is it secure?

59:34.810 --> 59:37.080
A nice Japanese lady
loaned me her phone.

59:37.850 --> 59:41.220
So, how's the new place?

59:41.220 --> 59:43.690
It's nice. Stylish.

59:44.990 --> 59:46.060
Something's wrong?

59:47.330 --> 59:49.790
Is this my life now, Alex?

59:49.800 --> 59:51.260
Stealing mobile phones,

59:51.260 --> 59:54.370
<i>waiting to catch a bullet
between my eyes?</i>

59:54.370 --> 59:57.900
Hey, don't let Vassiliev
get in your head.

59:57.910 --> 59:59.100
There are other ways...

59:59.110 --> 01:00:02.810
You give me some bullshit
speech about choices and path,

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:05.880
and promise me my fucking
freedom in five years.

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:07.210
You thought I was
gonna be long dead

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:09.310
before that, didn't you?

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.880
Well, not everyone makes it
through. I'll give you that.

01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:16.020
But you've got a shot.
For now, enjoy the moment.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:19.860
<i>Give yourself time, Anna.
It plays in your favor.</i>

01:00:19.860 --> 01:00:21.760
<i>Let the currents
move beneath you.</i>

01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.760
Powers will shift.
Enemies can vanish.

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.730
Do what you can to stay alive.
Time will do the rest.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:29.370
Promise me
something, Alex.

01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.840
Anything.

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.110
If I find a way
to get free one day,

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:37.940
would you be on my side?

01:00:37.950 --> 01:00:39.250
I'll do my best.

01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:41.950
I'll see you soon.

01:01:08.210 --> 01:01:09.970
Listen, I know

01:01:09.980 --> 01:01:12.480
that you're going through
a very, very rough time.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.780
And I don't know why,

01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:18.390
but also don't
want to know.

01:01:19.350 --> 01:01:21.190
What I want
you to know

01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.190
is that I love you
the way you are,

01:01:25.190 --> 01:01:26.390
and I'm always
gonna be there

01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:29.030
for you whenever
you need me.

01:01:30.200 --> 01:01:31.730
All right?

01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:34.430
Thank you.

01:01:45.550 --> 01:01:47.880
<i>Okay, girls,
let's do this.</i>

01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:50.250
Boom! Okay, lovely. Yes!

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:52.520
Very nice, girls.
Very, very nice.

01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:54.950
But give me dirty.
Give me dirtier.

01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:57.350
Yeah, that's nice.
That's very nice!

01:01:57.360 --> 01:02:00.520
Yes! Yes, green dress!
Oh, my God,

01:02:00.530 --> 01:02:03.230
you've got a lovely bunch
of fucking legs on you.

01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:05.430
All right, next.
Done. Next!

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:07.570
Whoo! Next, yeah? Okay.

01:02:07.570 --> 01:02:10.370
Oh, my God,
that was bloody lovely!

01:02:10.370 --> 01:02:11.900
We're feeling it.
We're feeling good.

01:02:11.910 --> 01:02:13.370
We're feeling good.
Hey! Boop, boop!

01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:14.980
Come on,
that was really nice.

01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:17.370
It's great.

01:02:17.380 --> 01:02:19.080
Do you know that I have
to leave at 5:00, right?

01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.450
No problem. In one hour
you are finished, okay?

01:02:21.450 --> 01:02:22.820
Awesome.

01:02:26.890 --> 01:02:28.590
That's nice. Fair enough.

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:32.060
Remember you are princesses,
not transvestites, yeah?

01:02:32.060 --> 01:02:32.990
So I'd like to see

01:02:32.990 --> 01:02:37.030
your feminine energy
if I could, please. Ooh.

01:02:37.030 --> 01:02:39.600
Hello? Yes?

01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.530
Strike a pose, yeah?

01:02:42.540 --> 01:02:45.470
So, uh, did you recover
from last night?

01:02:46.170 --> 01:02:47.240
Ooh.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.080
Okay, I had enough.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.610
Maybe. Yeah, I could.

01:02:51.610 --> 01:02:54.580
Anna, my love.
Hey, I'm trying to create here, yeah?

01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.020
So can you please just
strike that pose, yeah?

01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:59.220
- Fucking idiot.
- Anna...

01:02:59.220 --> 01:03:00.950
Don't move.

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:02.920
Please, Anna,
we need this job.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:07.560
Bring that thing that
you brought yesterday.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.060
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Tonight.
Ooh, she is not happy.

01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:12.030
Oh, my God!

01:03:13.030 --> 01:03:14.670
Let's get dirty now.
Smile.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:17.470
Smile. Give me
your best smile.

01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:21.410
Why?
Fucking hell, there's blood.

01:03:21.410 --> 01:03:23.110
I said give me
your best smile!

01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:26.240
- Okay.
- That's better.

01:03:26.250 --> 01:03:27.480
Now be a dog.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.280
Yeah, be a dog.
Woof, woof.

01:03:32.450 --> 01:03:34.190
Here's a good bitch, dog.

01:03:34.950 --> 01:03:36.450
Ow!

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:38.320
Put your hands
where they belong.

01:03:41.230 --> 01:03:42.900
Okay, that's the good one.

01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:48.040
That's a wrap.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.640
Fucking don't touch me.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:54.110
Don't touch me!

01:04:09.590 --> 01:04:10.960
Over an hour late!

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:11.890
I came here
as soon as I could.

01:04:11.890 --> 01:04:14.430
Olga's called at least
10 times already.

01:04:14.430 --> 01:04:17.300
Give me the fucking file
and shut the fuck up!

01:04:20.570 --> 01:04:23.200
<i>Wurtenberg, 49,
German diplomat,</i>

01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.400
with the embassy in Poland.

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:27.970
All illegal money from the
Middle East goes through him.

01:04:27.970 --> 01:04:29.410
He's divorced,
no kids.

01:04:29.410 --> 01:04:30.710
We've already made
several approaches,

01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:32.010
but it's hopeless.

01:04:32.010 --> 01:04:34.980
He can't be bought.
So we have no leverage for blackmail.

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:37.150
He does, however,
have one weak spot.

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:38.480
Let me guess.

01:04:38.490 --> 01:04:40.120
Here in Milan,
he uses a service

01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:41.450
run by a man
called Stefano.

01:04:41.450 --> 01:04:43.450
We've already sorted
things out on that end.

01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.260
So Wurtenberg
is waiting for you.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:46.320
Where is the piece?

01:04:46.330 --> 01:04:47.990
Bathroom.
Behind the second sink.

01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:50.730
- Bodyguards?
- Just one. A vicious bastard.

01:04:50.730 --> 01:04:52.630
We have eyes
in the hall,

01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:54.700
but no way of getting
a wire or camera in.

01:04:54.700 --> 01:04:57.070
There will be no backups.
So if there's a hitch...

01:04:57.070 --> 01:04:58.340
There won't be.

01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.100
Bring me the attache
case, keys,

01:05:00.110 --> 01:05:01.410
documents, and fingerprint.

01:05:01.410 --> 01:05:02.940
Any questions?

01:05:03.340 --> 01:05:04.480
Which room?

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:20.960
Go any further
and you will have to pay.

01:05:37.640 --> 01:05:40.650
- It's about time.
- Sorry. Traffic.

01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.520
Fashion week.

01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:48.290
- Can I use your bathroom?
- Yes, but, uh, hurry.

01:05:48.290 --> 01:05:50.620
- We have lost a lot of time.
- Won't be long.

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:52.530
Good.

01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:52.250
You were in
there 12 minutes.

01:06:52.250 --> 01:06:53.790
Well, he wasn't
very cooperative.

01:06:57.420 --> 01:07:00.720
- So where is his print?
- We can lift them off this.

01:07:00.730 --> 01:07:02.690
No, you idiot.
Didn't you read the memo?

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:03.830
Yeah, I've read it.

01:07:03.830 --> 01:07:05.830
So where's his fucking
index finger?

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:11.800
You expected me to...

01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:15.170
Bring back his finger, yes!
Like it says in the memo.

01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:16.910
How can you expect us
to compromise him

01:07:16.910 --> 01:07:18.680
without putting
his prints everywhere?

01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:22.480
You want me to send Mossan?

01:07:23.780 --> 01:07:26.890
No. No. It was my mistake.

01:07:26.890 --> 01:07:29.320
My mistake
and I've got to do this.

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:31.490
While you're there,
bring back your watch.

01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:32.590
Never leave
anything behind.

01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.100
Why are you still here? Go.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.280
Here.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.780
Are we done?

01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.320
Yes.

01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.590
Can I go
to bed now?

01:08:05.590 --> 01:08:08.360
Is there anyone else you
need me to kill and mutilate?

01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:09.360
What's wrong with you?

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:15.640
I'm just so tired
of everything.

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.340
I can't...

01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:25.640
- Take break.
- What?

01:08:25.649 --> 01:08:28.880
Take a week in the sun.
Wherever you want. Take Maude.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:30.380
Rest. Recuperate.

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:32.390
Get over this.
Whatever this is.

01:08:33.750 --> 01:08:36.460
- Thank you.
- One week. No more.

01:08:49.770 --> 01:08:52.569
Hey, girls,
can I buy you a drink?

01:08:52.569 --> 01:08:55.279
Unless you're a billionaire,
keep on walking, man.

01:09:02.950 --> 01:09:04.620
Geez, it's hot out here.

01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:05.850
Do you want to go back
to the bungalow,

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:06.920
and take a shower?

01:09:06.920 --> 01:09:09.460
Go ahead.
I'll join you later.

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.660
All right.

01:09:31.439 --> 01:09:32.510
Hi.

01:09:32.510 --> 01:09:34.979
Enjoy your vacation?

01:09:34.979 --> 01:09:37.979
Yeah, it was wonderful.
Even got you a present.

01:09:39.649 --> 01:09:41.660
Here, it's a postcard.

01:09:46.790 --> 01:09:47.800
Hmm.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.890
Lovely.

01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:51.430
Time to get back to work.

01:09:58.970 --> 01:10:00.340
What the fuck?

01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.410
Fuck!

01:10:13.050 --> 01:10:15.020
Number five,
can you turn, please.

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:36.110
Hey!

01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:39.740
Gentlemen, perfect,
lovely. Oh, great.

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:42.650
Perfect. Darling,
watch me. Don't move.

01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:45.490
Little more Marie-Antoinette.

01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:47.590
Perfect.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.720
Hey!

01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:56.430
Good, very nice.

01:10:56.430 --> 01:10:58.630
I want fire. Give it all.
Come on. Give it all.

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:00.800
Fire! Fire!
That's it. All right!

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:35.930
Yeah, push it more, baby!
Push it more, more, more!

01:11:35.940 --> 01:11:37.600
Give me what you got!
Give me what you got!

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.500
Come on! Come on!
Come on!

01:12:15.070 --> 01:12:17.080
You've done good
work this year.

01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.710
You're flying back
to Moscow next week.

01:12:20.710 --> 01:12:22.120
The boss wants
to see you.

01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:55.150
You are crazy.

01:12:56.250 --> 01:12:57.780
I needed it.

01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:03.860
Me too.

01:13:32.550 --> 01:13:35.120
I confess,
I had little faith in you at first.

01:13:36.090 --> 01:13:37.760
Girls who are
too beautiful

01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.890
become a problem
sooner or later.

01:13:39.890 --> 01:13:41.730
That's why we only hire
the ugly ones.

01:13:43.130 --> 01:13:45.630
Speaking of Olga,
she has asked

01:13:45.630 --> 01:13:48.600
for a medal of distinction
to be awarded to you.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.540
But don't get
your hopes up.

01:13:51.540 --> 01:13:53.300
There is no ceremony
or anything.

01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:54.870
When your service ends,

01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:57.710
your name will be engraved
on the wall at the entrance,

01:13:57.710 --> 01:14:01.280
and a pension will be paid to your
heirs, if you have any.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.020
Now, what do you think?

01:14:04.180 --> 01:14:05.990
Do you deserve
such an honor?

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.090
Check.

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.030
No.

01:14:19.870 --> 01:14:20.930
Mate.

01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:38.150
Grab her!
Joseph, come with me.

01:14:51.700 --> 01:14:54.900
Don't look so surprised.
I told you I'd see you around.

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:55.970
Now, you're gonna
wanna know

01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:57.030
how I knew
this was going down,

01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.130
and how long
I've been watching you,

01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.200
all that good stuff.

01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.670
And you deserve to know,
you do.

01:15:00.670 --> 01:15:03.070
Maybe we'll grab dinner
some night, hash it out.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:05.340
But right now,
we're in a bit of a pickle

01:15:05.350 --> 01:15:07.680
because we have five
minutes to cut a deal

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.850
before your friends start
to wonder where you are.

01:15:09.850 --> 01:15:11.150
So, how about I give you
a little recap?

01:15:11.150 --> 01:15:12.220
I understand
the situation.

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:13.750
Yeah, I'll recap anyway,

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.620
just so we're on
the same page.

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:18.290
Right now I can pin you for
the murder of Oleg Filenkov,

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:20.290
his bodyguards,
the clerk at Le Meurice.

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:22.960
The attempted murder
of Frederick Wurtenberg.

01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:25.760
Not to mention
the whole espionage thing.

01:15:25.770 --> 01:15:27.160
Now, I can have you
in a French prison

01:15:27.170 --> 01:15:28.100
inside of an hour,

01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:30.670
or I can make a call
and have you hauled off

01:15:30.670 --> 01:15:32.970
to one of our black sites
in the Czech Republic

01:15:32.970 --> 01:15:34.740
where the fine
men and women

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:37.010
of the United States
Intelligence community

01:15:37.010 --> 01:15:39.810
will violate your human
rights until they get bored.

01:15:39.810 --> 01:15:41.650
So you see the issue.

01:15:41.650 --> 01:15:42.980
Solution one,
we bump you off.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:44.750
It solves our problem,
but not yours.

01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:47.050
Plus, it ruins
our dinner plans.

01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:50.790
Solution two, you work for us.
You live.

01:15:50.790 --> 01:15:51.920
Dinner's optional.

01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.200
Is that all
you have to offer?

01:15:58.200 --> 01:16:00.130
I don't believe you're in
a position to negotiate.

01:16:01.670 --> 01:16:04.000
Fine then. Kill me.

01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:08.810
All you're offering
is the same shit

01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:10.370
I get from my people.

01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.310
Be a slave or die.

01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:14.180
Or don't you consider yourself
better than the Russians?

01:16:15.720 --> 01:16:18.280
Ah, historically, sure.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.920
Then make me a better offer.

01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:22.920
My bandwidth with
negotiation is limited.

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.760
I won't be too demanding.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.960
All right. Tell me what
would make you happy.

01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:30.190
Freedom and protection.

01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.860
Hmm.

01:16:31.860 --> 01:16:34.800
That's a tall order.
All right. Here it goes.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:36.130
You work for us
for three years,

01:16:36.140 --> 01:16:37.300
then we make
you disappear.

01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.970
You ever been to Arizona?
It's hot, but it's a dry heat.

01:16:39.970 --> 01:16:40.840
That's what they say.

01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:43.110
I've never actually
been in the summer.

01:16:43.110 --> 01:16:45.310
No, I work for one year.

01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:48.310
That's the max before
my cover's blown, anyway.

01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:50.250
And I want
to live by the sea.

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:52.420
- Vancouver.
- Too cold.

01:16:54.220 --> 01:16:55.920
Okay,
any suggestions?

01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:01.030
- Hawaii.
- Hawaii.

01:17:01.830 --> 01:17:03.930
Hawaii.

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:06.300
All right. Hawaii it is.

01:17:15.070 --> 01:17:17.940
- How did you catch me?
- The way you hold your bag.

01:17:29.020 --> 01:17:32.290
From now on,
you're under my protection.

01:17:32.290 --> 01:17:34.700
And the protection of the
United States of America.

01:17:58.950 --> 01:18:00.880
You were in
there 12 minutes.

01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:02.350
Well, he wasn't
very cooperative.

01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.460
So where's the print?

01:18:10.300 --> 01:18:12.300
Sir! She's coming back.

01:18:13.330 --> 01:18:14.330
Not a word.

01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:18.070
I need his finger.

01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:19.300
What the fuck
are you talking about?

01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:21.840
I need his
fucking finger!

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.110
No way,
he's not leaving this suite.

01:18:23.110 --> 01:18:25.940
Not him! Just his
fucking finger!

01:18:25.940 --> 01:18:27.810
Whoa, whoa, wait!
This was not part of the deal.

01:18:27.810 --> 01:18:28.880
I mean,
I can help you.

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.410
That's okay for me,
but no more.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:32.080
All right,
put him on the table.

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.580
Don't! Don't touch me!

01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:35.350
Don't!

01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:39.960
All right, proceed.

01:18:39.960 --> 01:18:42.060
No, no, no, no, no.
I have to do it.

01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:43.260
There is a specific
type of a cut

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:44.860
the KGB teaches
us to make

01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:46.830
just to make sure
we are not being forced.

01:18:46.830 --> 01:18:48.030
If it's gonna come out
any other way,

01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:49.430
she'll notice
something is wrong.

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:50.900
Oh. How do I know
you're not cutting it

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.040
in a way that
betrays us?

01:18:52.040 --> 01:18:53.570
Oh, you want me
to trust you about Hawaii?

01:18:53.570 --> 01:18:55.100
You better trust me
about this.

01:18:55.110 --> 01:18:56.370
Anyway, there was
already 10 times...

01:18:56.370 --> 01:18:58.580
All right, okay!
I understand!

01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.710
All right,
shut him up!

01:18:59.710 --> 01:19:03.250
Take a deep breath, sir.
Give her the fucking knife!

01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:12.960
Are we done?

01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:15.230
Yes, we're done.

01:19:15.230 --> 01:19:17.360
Can I go to bed now?

01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:20.270
Is there anyone else you need
me to kill and mutilate?

01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:25.940
Take a break.

01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.980
What are you doing here?

01:20:05.980 --> 01:20:07.580
I came to check on you.

01:20:07.580 --> 01:20:08.680
You could have called.

01:20:08.680 --> 01:20:12.050
At the CIA,
we're all about personal service.

01:20:12.050 --> 01:20:13.390
Everything okay?

01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.650
For now.

01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:19.390
Good. We're all good on our
side, and we're all clear.

01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:21.220
Trouble never
sends a warning.

01:20:21.230 --> 01:20:22.930
Damn straight.

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.370
You look rested,
you look tan.

01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.300
Why are you really here?

01:20:32.170 --> 01:20:34.140
I'm on vacation.

01:20:34.140 --> 01:20:36.570
You... You put the idea in my head.
You said Bahamas.

01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:39.380
I started thinking about
daiquiris on the beach.

01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:42.980
Feels good.
Feels good to kick back.

01:20:42.980 --> 01:20:45.150
Plus, there is that
dinner I owe you.

01:20:45.150 --> 01:20:46.350
I thought that
was optional.

01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:47.390
Yeah, it is.

01:20:51.190 --> 01:20:52.990
I'm gonna
look after you, Anna.

01:20:54.090 --> 01:20:55.330
Keep you safe.

01:20:55.330 --> 01:20:59.100
You're with us now.
We protect our assets.

01:21:01.700 --> 01:21:03.700
You'll keep your promise?

01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.400
You'll let me
go after a year?

01:21:05.400 --> 01:21:07.200
Uh-huh.

01:21:07.210 --> 01:21:10.170
I already have them looking
for a house in Hawaii.

01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:12.510
I can't guarantee
an island preference.

01:21:15.150 --> 01:21:16.210
Doesn't matter.

01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:17.620
No, but believe me,
it does.

01:21:19.580 --> 01:21:21.120
You've never been?

01:21:21.650 --> 01:21:23.020
No.

01:21:24.360 --> 01:21:25.960
Then why Hawaii?

01:21:27.160 --> 01:21:30.330
Postcards on
my parents' refrigerator.

01:21:30.330 --> 01:21:33.170
It always looked like
a dream. And you?

01:21:33.730 --> 01:21:35.600
Yeah, born and raised.

01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:39.000
A real island native.

01:21:39.010 --> 01:21:42.210
My dad was in the Navy.
Like yours.

01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:47.040
You'll love it.
You'll surf.

01:21:47.050 --> 01:21:49.120
You'll eat spam.
It's paradise.

01:21:51.450 --> 01:21:54.020
Plus, I will
personally guarantee

01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.020
that your dream
becomes a reality.

01:22:04.500 --> 01:22:06.300
You better get some tan

01:22:06.300 --> 01:22:08.170
or you'll look
too conspicuous.

01:22:09.440 --> 01:22:11.140
Yeah, good advice.

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:14.470
Well, if you...
If you need me,

01:22:14.470 --> 01:22:16.010
you know where
to find me.

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.740
In the closet?

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.450
And she's funny.

01:22:22.210 --> 01:22:23.620
The total package.

01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:39.400
So I finally have enough money
to start building.

01:22:40.230 --> 01:22:42.630
And it's a beautiful area.

01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:44.630
It's not too far away
from Saint-Tropez.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:46.340
It's not too far away
from the beach.

01:22:46.340 --> 01:22:47.770
They have no tourists.

01:22:47.770 --> 01:22:50.570
Super peaceful,
you know?

01:22:50.580 --> 01:22:52.650
I actually did
the drawing by myself

01:22:53.510 --> 01:22:55.480
and I was thinking,

01:22:55.480 --> 01:22:58.680
I wanna build the whole
house with my own hands.

01:23:06.230 --> 01:23:08.660
Do you actually know
my father was a carpenter?

01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:14.330
Anna.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.700
Did you hear
anything I said?

01:23:18.570 --> 01:23:20.870
No. Not a word.

01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:22.310
What's wrong with you?

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:28.680
Go ahead, get it.
I'm not hungry anyway.

01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:37.450
Yeah?

01:23:40.590 --> 01:23:41.760
How's your vacation?

01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:43.430
Pretty good.

01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:46.560
Looks like a nice place.

01:23:46.570 --> 01:23:48.070
You've been here?

01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:49.440
No.

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:53.140
Are you spying on me?

01:23:53.770 --> 01:23:55.480
<i>I'm doing my job.</i>

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:58.340
I like it here.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:23:59.850
I already put a down payment
on a bungalow.

01:24:00.780 --> 01:24:03.180
Hmm. Not very funny.

01:24:35.550 --> 01:24:36.780
What's wrong?

01:24:37.580 --> 01:24:38.750
I figure we're probably

01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:40.380
never gonna be able
to have that dinner.

01:24:40.390 --> 01:24:43.290
- Yeah, you're probably right.
- So let's fuck instead.

01:24:58.770 --> 01:24:59.770
Hi.

01:25:01.210 --> 01:25:03.970
- Enjoy your vacation?
- Yeah, it was wonderful.

01:25:21.430 --> 01:25:24.230
I gotta be at the embassy
in a half hour.

01:25:24.230 --> 01:25:25.400
You're gonna be late.

01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.630
<i>She making any moves?</i>

01:25:54.330 --> 01:25:55.390
No.

01:25:55.390 --> 01:25:56.730
<i>At all?</i>

01:25:57.360 --> 01:25:58.860
<i>Not at all.</i>

01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.470
All right, shut it down.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:22.490
I have a job for you,
when you're back at Moscow.

01:26:23.490 --> 01:26:25.290
What kind of job?

01:26:25.290 --> 01:26:27.490
For the last 20 years,
we've had

01:26:27.490 --> 01:26:29.430
a relationship
with the KGB.

01:26:29.430 --> 01:26:31.760
It's not been friendly,
but it's been respectful.

01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.730
We're all in the same
business after all.

01:26:33.730 --> 01:26:34.870
That all changed

01:26:34.870 --> 01:26:36.800
when Vassiliev
was appointed director.

01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:38.470
We need someone
on the inside.

01:26:38.470 --> 01:26:40.970
You guys want to get rid of
the number one at the KGB?

01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:42.510
We know how
to get a gun in.

01:26:42.510 --> 01:26:43.840
We know how
to get our operative out.

01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:45.880
All you need is the sucker
to do the job?

01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:48.510
All we need is a partner to
participate in the mission.

01:26:48.510 --> 01:26:51.320
So use one of your American
partners in Moscow to do it.

01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.490
Five years ago,

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:58.290
we lost nine agents
in one day.

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.530
On my watch.

01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:07.370
Vassiliev gave the order.

01:27:08.930 --> 01:27:11.470
They were just men and women
doing their job.

01:27:11.470 --> 01:27:13.740
So you don't have
American agents to do it.

01:27:13.740 --> 01:27:15.970
- You have to use a Russian.
- We need the best.

01:27:15.970 --> 01:27:17.640
I'm gonna get
my head blown off.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:20.980
I've been putting this
together for three years.

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:22.750
I've checked every detail
a hundred times.

01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:25.050
Nothing's foolproof,
but it's damn close.

01:27:25.050 --> 01:27:27.450
We take out Vassiliev,
restore a little order.

01:27:27.450 --> 01:27:29.620
I just need to find the right
person to make it happen.

01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:30.890
You make everything happen.

01:27:30.890 --> 01:27:32.860
I'm not gonna
make you do this.

01:27:32.860 --> 01:27:36.600
Anna, if you say
it's a no go, it's a no go.

01:27:38.700 --> 01:27:39.530
But you should know,

01:27:41.530 --> 01:27:43.770
I got them to sign off
on early retirement.

01:27:43.770 --> 01:27:45.040
What do you mean?

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.570
You do this job,
you're off to Hawaii.

01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:51.470
Total Freedom.
Total Protection.

01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:52.610
Everything you wanted.

01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:54.710
And they agreed?
Just like that?

01:27:54.710 --> 01:27:56.780
I must have been
very persuasive.

01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:58.450
What did you tell them?

01:27:58.450 --> 01:28:00.020
I told them
I didn't want to lose you.

01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:07.960
Okay.

01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:10.360
Good.

01:28:22.670 --> 01:28:24.410
Will you be in Moscow?

01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:28.480
I'm gonna personally
ex-filtrate you.

01:28:28.480 --> 01:28:30.020
That's the only way
I know you'll be safe.

01:29:12.060 --> 01:29:13.160
Check.

01:29:29.240 --> 01:29:30.610
Mate.

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:34.780
- I'm sorry, Alex.
- You're crazy!

01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:36.850
You'll never make it
out of here alive.

01:29:36.850 --> 01:29:38.020
Lay down.

01:29:40.190 --> 01:29:42.090
- You're a dead woman.
- I love you, too.

01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:50.530
It's gonna make you sleep.

01:32:44.700 --> 01:32:45.840
For your own security,

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:47.740
please back up
at least 20 meters.

01:32:47.740 --> 01:32:51.140
Okay, my friend, you see
that door? Right there.

01:32:51.140 --> 01:32:53.010
Any second,
my counterpart will appear,

01:32:53.010 --> 01:32:55.950
and then your worries
will be over, all right?

01:34:39.980 --> 01:34:42.250
- Get out!
- Go, go, go! Drive!

01:34:57.370 --> 01:34:59.470
Anna?

01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:02.910
Don't move!

01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:05.040
Don't move!

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:17.150
Um,
usually, I do these things

01:35:17.150 --> 01:35:18.350
with a little
more civility,

01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.960
but it's been a fuckable week
and I'm at the end of a rope.

01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:23.360
You're gonna answer
yes or no,

01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:24.960
and don't lie because
trust me I'll know.

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:27.130
- Do you know who I am?
- No.

01:35:27.130 --> 01:35:28.260
Right answer.

01:35:28.270 --> 01:35:30.200
Are you affiliated
with the KGB, yes or no?

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:31.330
No.

01:35:31.340 --> 01:35:33.440
- Mossad.
- I don't know what Mossad...

01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.170
Yes or no? That's the game.

01:35:36.170 --> 01:35:37.510
No!

01:35:39.580 --> 01:35:41.440
All right. Anna.
Have you seen her?

01:35:42.950 --> 01:35:44.410
No.

01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.850
I'm gonna tell you
exactly what to do.

01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:49.050
If she makes contact.
If she calls you,

01:35:49.050 --> 01:35:51.990
if you call her,
you're gonna get in touch with me.

01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:54.390
- Understand?
- Yes.

01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:56.130
We've already bugged
your apartment.

01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.960
All right, get out.

01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:18.320
I'm sorry
for disturbing your day.

01:36:48.180 --> 01:36:50.110
Man of the hour. Congrats.

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:53.580
- Thanks, man.
- Solid fucking operation.

01:36:53.580 --> 01:36:55.120
Vassiliev was
a confirmed kill,

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:57.090
and the Russians are ready
to appoint someone else.

01:36:57.090 --> 01:36:58.550
Yeah. Hopefully
someone better.

01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:00.120
Can't be anyone worse.

01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:02.130
Christ, that guy
was a prick.

01:37:02.930 --> 01:37:04.390
You made things right.

01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:06.000
It took time,
but you got back at 'em.

01:37:06.000 --> 01:37:07.930
Nobody's ever gonna
forget that.

01:37:08.370 --> 01:37:09.530
Good.

01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:12.600
And the girl? Any news?

01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:14.370
Dead, probably.
If she's lucky.

01:37:14.370 --> 01:37:16.440
A girl like her,
up in a Siberian gulag?

01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:18.410
- How's that gonna go?
- Uh-huh.

01:37:18.410 --> 01:37:20.180
Let's grab dinner
before you leave town.

01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:22.080
Yeah, sure.

01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:25.120
Great work. Big win
for the good guys. Yeah.

01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:05.150
<i>Entering the park.</i>

01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:06.160
Roger.

01:38:20.170 --> 01:38:22.170
You wanna tell our guys
to be a little more discreet?

01:38:22.170 --> 01:38:23.640
<i>I can spot them a mile away.</i>

01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:26.180
Agents 1 and 2, you're too conspicuous.
Move back.

01:38:54.610 --> 01:38:56.510
Any idea
who that could be?

01:38:57.710 --> 01:38:58.980
We're on it.

01:39:00.710 --> 01:39:02.750
To my right,
Alexei Tchenkov.

01:39:07.150 --> 01:39:09.720
- Uh, espresso ristretto.
- <i>Tres bien.</i>

01:39:10.650 --> 01:39:12.520
Leonard Miller, CIA.

01:39:12.520 --> 01:39:14.690
<i>He was in Moscow
when Vassiliev was killed.</i>

01:39:14.690 --> 01:39:16.660
All agents stand by
to intervene.

01:39:30.570 --> 01:39:32.270
Hey, get me
the fuck out of here.

01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.380
Don't worry,
we're coming in.

01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.220
Yes, sir.

01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:42.290
Exfiltration procedure
imminent.

01:39:43.760 --> 01:39:44.820
We have movement.

01:39:44.820 --> 01:39:47.160
<i>Sit tight, Alexei.</i>

01:39:47.160 --> 01:39:49.590
Like a duck
waiting to get shot.

01:39:49.590 --> 01:39:50.790
Nobody's getting shot.

01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:52.660
Exfiltration
in 20 seconds.

01:39:54.470 --> 01:39:57.700
Alexei, don't do
anything stupid.

01:39:57.700 --> 01:39:58.700
Fifteen...

01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:04.740
Ten...

01:40:09.650 --> 01:40:10.750
- <i>Five...</i>
- Wait. Wait.

01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:12.420
Wait, wait, wait. Hold off.

01:40:12.420 --> 01:40:13.520
<i>Hold off. Hold off.</i>

01:40:13.520 --> 01:40:14.620
Why? What's going on?

01:40:14.620 --> 01:40:15.620
She's here.

01:40:23.530 --> 01:40:24.600
Whoa.

01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:29.670
It's good to see you.

01:40:29.670 --> 01:40:31.430
I'll kill you with
my own hands, Anna.

01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:32.500
You know that?

01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:35.440
I know, but we
have to talk first.

01:40:55.760 --> 01:40:57.460
Any more lovers
you want to tell us about?

01:40:57.460 --> 01:40:59.730
No, just the two of you.

01:40:59.730 --> 01:41:01.400
What the hell's going on?

01:41:02.230 --> 01:41:03.240
I came to say goodbye.

01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:05.540
For good.

01:41:07.810 --> 01:41:09.910
When I was a kid, I used
to play with Matryoskha dolls

01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:12.510
way before I pretended to
sell them on a street corner.

01:41:13.610 --> 01:41:14.680
I loved opening them up

01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:16.950
and looking
at their beautiful faces.

01:41:16.950 --> 01:41:20.580
It's a woman inside of a woman
inside of a woman.

01:41:20.580 --> 01:41:23.190
Now there would be a doll
made of me, what would she be?

01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:27.590
<i>A daughter? A girlfriend?</i>

01:41:27.590 --> 01:41:29.890
<i>A Russian spy? A model?</i>

01:41:29.890 --> 01:41:31.430
An American spy?

01:41:33.260 --> 01:41:34.700
If you go
to the very smallest doll

01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:36.240
buried deep inside,
what is she?

01:41:36.870 --> 01:41:38.400
I never knew.

01:41:39.270 --> 01:41:41.700
And I would like
to find out.

01:41:41.710 --> 01:41:44.370
Whatever we had,
each of us brought me here.

01:41:44.370 --> 01:41:47.540
It gave me the will to live
and face to myself.

01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:49.510
Something I will
never forget.

01:41:49.510 --> 01:41:51.720
But you forgot
the rules, Anna.

01:41:56.690 --> 01:41:59.890
Here. That's what
I got from the KGB.

01:42:11.770 --> 01:42:13.370
And that's what
I got from the CIA.

01:42:15.970 --> 01:42:17.840
- When?
- Your case.

01:42:37.530 --> 01:42:39.570
- Nice work.
- Thank you.

01:42:40.930 --> 01:42:42.330
So what happens now?

01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:44.970
You both got
what belongs to you.

01:42:46.540 --> 01:42:48.740
Everything goes back
to normal.

01:42:48.740 --> 01:42:50.340
And we part as good friends.

01:42:50.340 --> 01:42:51.910
And if anything
happens to you,

01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:53.480
there's a copy someplace.

01:42:53.480 --> 01:42:54.910
Goes straight
to the press, huh?

01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:58.050
I hope you're both as fond
of me as I am of you.

01:42:58.050 --> 01:43:01.050
You'll make sure
this will never happen.

01:43:01.050 --> 01:43:03.420
That's a lot of faith
to put in people

01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:04.690
you don't really
know, Anna.

01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:08.520
In six months, the information
you have will be obsolete.

01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:10.600
They will come after you,
wherever you are.

01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:14.400
I never had
a single day of freedom.

01:43:17.530 --> 01:43:19.270
Six months is an eternity.

01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.640
And I better have it.

01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:25.880
Are we agreed?

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:32.620
I wish you the very best.

01:43:34.990 --> 01:43:36.790
For at least six months.

01:43:41.990 --> 01:43:43.360
Alex?

01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:48.600
It's a bitter
pill to swallow.

01:43:50.440 --> 01:43:52.540
I asked you once,

01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:54.970
if I found a way out,
would you be on my side?

01:43:54.970 --> 01:43:58.070
No. No. I said
I would do my best.

01:43:58.080 --> 01:43:59.940
That's all I'm asking.

01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:28.770
If you ever
change your mind,

01:44:28.770 --> 01:44:30.970
come home to your family.

01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:32.340
Understand?

01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:36.480
The only family I have
is at this table.

01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:51.660
The bitch! If she thinks
she's getting away with this...

01:44:57.600 --> 01:45:00.600
Keep recording.
Keep recording.

01:45:00.610 --> 01:45:02.340
You, stay here.

01:45:14.550 --> 01:45:15.620
You wanna leave first?

01:45:17.050 --> 01:45:18.460
I think I'll stay awhile.

01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:24.030
- Buy you a drink?
- Don't push it, comrade.

01:45:33.970 --> 01:45:36.170
- Anna!
- Olga?

01:45:36.170 --> 01:45:37.940
No one fucks with KGB!

01:45:47.190 --> 01:45:48.820
All agents, move!
Move! Move!

01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:50.750
<i>Let's go!
Get him out of there!</i>

01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.050
Let me help her,
Tchenkov.

01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.890
What makes you think
she needs your help?

01:45:58.560 --> 01:45:59.530
She's gonna die.

01:45:59.530 --> 01:46:01.900
We're all going to die
one day, my friend.

01:46:06.670 --> 01:46:08.670
I think it would be
preferable if you left first.

01:46:08.670 --> 01:46:10.440
You have a clear path
behind you.

01:46:11.840 --> 01:46:13.180
I insist.

01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:59.560
Get me two crepes.
No topping, just sugar.

01:47:06.630 --> 01:47:08.830
I know the Americans
have contacted you.

01:47:10.100 --> 01:47:11.830
What are you talking about?

01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:13.070
When you came back
from the suite,

01:47:13.070 --> 01:47:14.810
you had cuff marks
on your wrists.

01:47:18.910 --> 01:47:20.610
That's when
you lost your watch.

01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:25.850
I know you, Anna.

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.850
I know you
like my own daughter.

01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.290
For now,

01:47:32.290 --> 01:47:34.990
what I know
doesn't leave this limousine.

01:47:36.930 --> 01:47:38.330
But you must report to me

01:47:38.330 --> 01:47:40.130
everything the Americans
are planning.

01:47:51.340 --> 01:47:53.210
<i>What kind of job?</i>

01:47:53.210 --> 01:47:54.310
<i>The last 20 years,</i>

01:47:54.310 --> 01:47:57.610
<i>we've had a relationship
with the KGB.</i>

01:47:57.610 --> 01:48:00.350
It's not been friendly,
but it's been respectful.

01:48:00.350 --> 01:48:02.920
We're all in the same
business, after all.

01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:04.020
That all changed

01:48:04.020 --> 01:48:06.060
when Vassiliev
was appointed director.

01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:08.530
They want to kill Vassiliev?

01:48:09.690 --> 01:48:11.030
And they want me
to do the job.

01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:23.040
What do you want most
in the world, Anna?

01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:28.010
My freedom.

01:48:30.180 --> 01:48:33.720
Do exactly as I say,
and I give you my word,

01:48:33.720 --> 01:48:34.890
you will be free.

01:49:10.090 --> 01:49:12.190
Where is it? Okay.

01:49:14.230 --> 01:49:15.330
Give me another angle.

01:49:27.340 --> 01:49:30.710
From the left.
That one. Zoom in.

01:49:30.710 --> 01:49:33.010
More! More, more, more.

01:49:33.010 --> 01:49:36.080
Let me see the face.
On the face!

01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:56.330
Turn it off.

01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:07.330
<i>My dear Olga,</i>

01:52:07.330 --> 01:52:08.300
<i>if you receive this message,</i>

01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:09.370
<i>everything must have
gone to plan.</i>

01:52:09.370 --> 01:52:11.900
<i>You're in Vassiliev's
chair, and I'm...</i>

01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:12.970
<i>Well, I hope I'm alive.</i>

01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:15.540
<i>You taught me
how to protect myself</i>

01:52:15.540 --> 01:52:17.270
<i>because no one else
can do it for me.</i>

01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:19.540
<i>And I am very grateful
for that.</i>

01:52:19.540 --> 01:52:20.580
<i>But the only thing
I couldn't do</i>

01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:23.050
<i>is to delete my file
from the database.</i>

01:52:23.050 --> 01:52:27.180
<i>'Cause only Vassiliev can
do that. Or his successor.</i>

01:52:27.180 --> 01:52:28.220
<i>I know you'll keep your word,</i>

01:52:28.220 --> 01:52:29.520
<i>'cause honor is
very important to you,</i>

01:52:29.520 --> 01:52:31.350
<i>and we're nothing without it.</i>

01:52:31.360 --> 01:52:34.120
<i>But just in case
you wanna change our deal,</i>

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:36.290
<i>I've planted another
wolf trap in the snow.</i>

01:52:36.290 --> 01:52:38.960
<i>I've recorded
our last conversation.</i>

01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:41.060
Vassiliev's shelf life
has expired.

01:52:41.070 --> 01:52:43.630
<i>Enough with these men
running our lives.</i>

01:52:43.630 --> 01:52:46.600
Use the gun the Americans
will hide for you.

01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:50.570
