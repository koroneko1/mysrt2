If you have just tuned in
to this special bulletin,

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,140
Washington has confirmed
that, yesterday,

9
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,140
on the fourth
of October, 1957,

10
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,480
the Soviet Union
successfully launched...

11
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,810
history's first
man-made satellite...

12
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:32,110
into space orbit
around the Earth.

(Switch Clicks)
(Motor Humming)

14
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,320
The satellite which the Russians
have dubbed Sputnik...

15
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,700
is being hailed
as a milestone in history.

16
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:21,620
No one in our nation's capital
could deny that the satellite...

17
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,580
has ushered in a grim
new chapter in the Cold War.

18
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:27,040
And indeed,
a wave of national anxiety...

19
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,040
already seems
to be sweeping the country.

of 18,000 miles an hour,

completing an orbit of the Earth
every 96 minutes.

22
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,220
Doctor Wernher von Braun,

23
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,940
Chief Engineer of the Army
Ballistic Missile Agency,

24
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:51,020
expressed the hope
that the United States...

25
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,400
would soon be following
the Russians into space...

26
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,690
with our own
artificial satellite.

27
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,690
Doctor von Braun confirmed...

28
00:01:57,730 --> 00:02:00,570
that there has still been
no actual sighting
of the Soviet satellite,

29
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,700
but the U.S. Expects
to be tracking it very soon.

30
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,620
We are told that Sputnik will be
visible to the naked eye...

31
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:10,120
about an hour after sunset
and an hour before dawn,

over the United States.

What the beeping signal means
we still don't know.

and she ain't payin' attention
to nothin' but the movie,

137
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:12,150

00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,930
that's the one that's
gonna draw the scouts.

152
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,850
Yeah. Welch knows it too.
They're gonna be coming
after us.

153
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,600
Well, y'all be careful, Jim.
Last year, those two boys from
Welch got their arms broken.

154
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,900
Well, they started it.
(Laughing)

155
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,940
It don't matter much
who started it.
I don't call that football.

156
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,190
You don't worry about Jim.

157
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:30,740
Ain't nobody on the Welch team
that can catch him.

158
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,870
I wish the scouts could've seen
that first game with Bluefield.
I'm gonna build a rocket.

159
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,620
Like Sputnik.

160
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:42,880
Well, I'm not sayin' it's gonna
go up in space or anything,

161
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,880
but I'm gonna do it.

162
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,130
I'm gonna build a rocket.
(Chuckles)

163
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,390
Well, just don't
blow yourself up.

164
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,600
(Laughing)

165
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:57,270
More eggs, anybody?

166
00:09:57,340 --> 00:10:00,310
Nice rocket, Homer.
How high do you think
it will fly?

167
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:03,860
Well, I got it packed with
the powder from 30 sky rockets.

168
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:05,860
Three, four miles.

169
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,650
You ready?
Yeah.

170
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:12,570
Yeah.
(All)
Ten, nine...

171
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,910
Eight, seven, six...
Should we get behind somethin'?

172
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,790
(Grunting)

173
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,000
(Gasps)
Wh-What happened?

174
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:24,920
- (Homer)
My rocket blew up.
- Are you okay?

175
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:27,000
- I guess.
- My heart's poundin'.

176
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,670
I thought the mine blew up.
Oh, Homer.

177
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:37,680
I waited six months for
the company carpenter to get
around puttin' up that fence.

178
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,020
Didn't I tell you
not to blow yourself up?

179
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:42,600
Yes, ma'am.

180
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,860
Then let's not.
(Sighs)

181
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:50,280
(Woman) Elsie.
(Elsie)
It's all right, Ms. Fields.!

182
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,650
It's all right.

183
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:55,490
(Homer's Voice)
Dear Dr. Von Braun,

184
00:10:55,570 --> 00:10:57,490
(TV Announcer)
Six, five, four, three...
My name is Homer Hickam.

185
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,040
Two, one...
I'm 17 and I live in a small
mining town in West Virginia.

186
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:03,080
Ignition.

187
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,710
Liftoff. Liftoff.

188
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,460
I'm writing to offer
my condolences to you
and your team...

189
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,880
on your recent attempt
to launch the Vanguard rocket.

190
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,100
I also had a disastrous
occurrence during the launch
of my own small rocket.

191
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,230
Since here in Coalwood,
everyone's much more
interested...

192
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,770
in what's down below the earth
than what's above it,

193
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,690
there isn't a whole lot
of material to be found
on the subject of rocketry.

194
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:34,070
So I've been kind of stumbling
around in the dark.

You go ahead,

Hi, Homer.
Hi.

204
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,910
I don't let anybody
copy my homework.

205
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,580
I don't wanna copy
your homework.

206
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,290
Um,

207
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,420
do you know anything
about rockets?

208
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,040
Of course I do.

209
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,920
Uh, you wanna come with me
over to the library?

210
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,960
No.

211
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,930
(Students Murmuring)

212
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,810
What do you wanna know
about rockets?

213
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,480
Everything.

214
00:12:55,690 --> 00:13:01,070
Well, rocketry was actually
invented by the Chinese
as early as 1,000 A.D.

215
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,330
And, supposedly,
they were quite sophisticated.

216
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,330
(Chattering Continues)

217
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:11,500
Potassium chlorate and sulphur.

218
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:14,710
Uh, well,
what'd you use?

219
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,470
Uh, somethin' like that.

220
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,680
(Homer)
Hey, Quentin, this is great.

221
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,640
This is exactly... We have
everything we need in here.

222
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,640
Roy Lee,
drive me to my house.

223
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,730
We can use my basement.
Yeah, at least nobody'll
see us down there.

224
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,440
Go, go, go.
(Engine Turning Over)

225
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:35,400
Come on.
(Quentin)
You got a loose choke cable.

226
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:37,400
You hear that?

227
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,700
The butterfly valve
isn't closin' all the way.

228
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:47,580
Uh, last year I built
an internal combustion engine...

229
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:49,790
and entered it
in the science fair.

230
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:52,670
Yeah, well, you wouldn't happen
to have it on you, would you?

This thing's startin'
to look like a rocket.

245
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:40,340
Listen to this.
"Weld the washer
to the base of the rocket body,

246
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:44,300
creating a combustion chamber
and nozzle."

247
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:47,390
We don't know how to weld.
Weld.

248
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:50,350
Homer,
your brother's in metal shop.
Maybe he could, uh...

249
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,230
- Do we really need
this nozzle thing?
- For cryin'out loud,

250
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,570
the nozzle's
the most important part.

251
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:01,400
It directs the flow
of the hot gases.!
Hey, cool it, Quentin.

252
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,950
(Roy Lee)
Man, talkin'about
your hot gases.

253
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,830
I don't think your father
would like you sneaking up in
the middle of the night in here.

254
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,960
And I know that he wouldn't
like me welding for you
on company time.

255
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,420
Well, what if I paid
the company for your time?

256
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,880
Homer, I can't.

257
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,430
I would lose my job.

258
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,470
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:33,810
Did you see Sputnik go over
the other night?
Nah.

260
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,900
'Cause it was beautiful.

261
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:42,190
I stood there and watched it
streak across the sky.

262
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:48,120
And anywhere in the world,
someone could look up
and see exactly what I saw.

263
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:52,450
For once, it felt like Coalwood
was part of the outside world.

264
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:57,710
Homer, believe me,
there are much worse places
than Coalwood in this world.

265
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:00,840
Besides, this is just
a flying piece of steel.

266
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,130
You know, a rocket
took it up there, Mr. Bykovsky.

267
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,430
I don't know. L...

268
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,970
When I was workin'
on this rocket, I felt like,

269
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:15,520
I felt like I was,
like I was Wernher von Braun.

270
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,610
Let me see.

271
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,400
Homer,

272
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,030
it will be our secret.

273
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,660
Mr. Bykovsky did
a dang good job on this.

274
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:34,330
Yeah, well,
he used a washer for the weld.

275
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,120
Man, it looks just like it did
in the picture.
Prodigious.

276
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,130
When, uh,
when do we go?

277
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,130
Give me that.
Uh, Saturday...

278
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,380
What is this,
a weapon of some kind?

279
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:46,680
(Homer Chuckling)
No, sir. It's a,
it's a rocket.

280
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,470
I don't allow dangerous devices
on school grounds.

281
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:53,640
Mr. Turner, I asked Homer
to bring that to school.
To show it in class.

282
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,230
You know, the boys are
thinkin' about enterin'
that county science fair.

283
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,150
Be careful, gentlemen.
I'm gonna have my eye on you.

284
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,070
Thank you, Mr. Turner.

285
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,280
That science fair is rigged.
All the judges are from Welch,

286
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:09,870
so only the kids from Welch
ever win.

287
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,700
And besides,
science fairs are for geeks.

288
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,700
No offense, Quentin.

289
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,710
Well, it's too bad
you feel that way.

290
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,580
You know, the winners go on
to the National Science Fair
in Indianapolis,

291
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:24,210
and colleges from all over the
country hand out scholarships.

292
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,340
It's great.
Have a good lunch, boys.

293
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,260
College scholarships
for winning a science fair?

294
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,310
Well, maybe
it's not for you.

295
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,430
W-W-Well,
what do you mean?
Homer, you got a great mind.

296
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:41,810
But science requires math,
which has never been one
of your favorite subjects.

297
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:46,740
(Chuckling)
Can't just dream your way
out of Coalwood, Homer.

298
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,990
Auk I.
Stroke of genius, Homer.

299
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,210
It won't fly unless somebody
lights the fuse.

300
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,460
What the hell is auk?

301
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,630
It's a bird that don't fly.

302
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:04,920
What, kind of like
a parakeet?

303
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:06,800
Ready?
(Whistle Blowing)

304
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:11,430
Well, Youngstown's
always been fair, Otis,

305
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,260
(Chuckling)
But you're askin' me to lay off
damn near half the town.

306
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,640
The mine
is just not producin'...

307
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,810
the way it was
ten years ago, John.

308
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,810
We're payin'the same labor
for half the tonnage.

309
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,150
What if we were
to open up a new shaft?

310
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,570
(John)
That coal is down there, Otis.

311
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,320
You just, you just
let me go after it.

312
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,660
The Coalwood mine
is givin' out, Mr. Hickam.

313
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,370
Move!

314
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:45,790
Ten...
(All)
Nine, eight,

315
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:49,010
seven, six, five,

316
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,800
four, three, two...

317
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,640
Uh-oh.
Holy shit,
it's headed for the mine!

318
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,810
- (Yelling)
- I told you we didn't know
what we were doin'!

319
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,810
I told you!
Oh, no. Oh, no.

320
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:08,280
(Chattering, Shouting)

321
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,530
(Chattering Continues)

322
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:16,370
(Man)
I don't believe this.
Go ahead.

323
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,120
(Man)
God in heaven, I thought
it was a guided missile.!

324
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,170
(Laughing)
I thought the damn Russians
were attackin'us.

325
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,290
(Man)
The boy's in trouble now.

326
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,010
So this is what you been up to
in the basement, huh?

327
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:37,100
Yes, sir.
Damn, Homer.

328
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,680
You could've killed somebody
with this idiot thing.

329
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,730
I know, sir.
I'm sorry. I was...

330
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,560
Well, Homer here
wants to be a rocket scientist.
Is that it, John?

331
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,610
He has no idea
what he wants to be.

332
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,730
But I know what he is.
He's a menace,

333
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,740
and he's a damn thief.

334
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,740
Dad...
And so is whoever
helped you.

335
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,080
Ike Bykovsky did this,
didn't he?

336
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,580
Don't you ever
let me catch you...

337
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:04,160
with these fool things
on company property again,
you understand me?

338
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:08,460
Yes, sir.
Then go home.

339
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,430
(Phone Ringing)

340
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:27,400
(Thunderclap)
Yeah?
What's your tunnel number?

341
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:32,070
He called me a thief, Ma,
in front of everybody.

342
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,780
I mean, how could he do that?
He was dead wrong
callin' you that.

343
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,820
He'd never have done that
to Jim.

344
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,990
They could catch Jim
stickin' up the company store,

345
00:20:41,070 --> 00:20:43,910
and Dad would probably laugh
and say, "That's my boy."

346
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:46,370
I know he's hard to understand
sometimes, Homer,

347
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:48,380
but you have to know
he loves you.

348
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,960
He loves the mine...

349
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,010
more than Jim even.

350
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:56,050
More than you.
You hush up.

351
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,300
(TV: Screaming)
What's it given him back?

352
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:02,640
Nothin' but a spot on his lung
the size of a damn quarter.

353
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,600
You don't know
what the mine gives me.

354
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,320
You don't know
'cause you're still a boy.

355
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:16,450
But, by golly, you're gonna
find out soon enough.

356
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:20,200
(Thunder Continues)

357
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:29,750
(Scoffs)
I'm never goin' down there.

358
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:32,670
(Fork Clatters)

359
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,210
You better have a talk
with your son, Elsie,

360
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:38,090
'cause he's out of control.

361
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,940
Where's my rocket stuff?
Right where they belong.

362
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:17,710
(Gunshot)

363
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:22,760
Quentin, you know, that rocket
went up at least 100 feet.
(Gunshots Continue)

364
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:24,760
More like 200.

365
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,470
(Gunshot)
God...

366
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:33,360
Man, will you cut it out,
Roy Lee?
Die, you son of a bitch.

367
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:35,940
Come on.
My turn now.
Hey, man. What's with you?

368
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,110
Man, we should be tryin'
to get in that science fair...

369
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,320
instead of sittin' around here
like a bunch of hillbillies.

370
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,070
I got some really
bad news for you, Homer.
We are a bunch of hillbillies.

371
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,250
Besides, um, didn't your dad
say no more rockets?

372
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:51,160
No. He said no more rockets
on company property.

373
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,710
Do you realize
how far we'd have to go
to get off company property?

374
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:55,710
Yeah. We have
to go to Snakeroot.

375
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,090
Snakeroot?
That's eight miles.

376
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:01,300
It's not that far.
I mean, we could walk
if we have to.

377
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:04,760
Oh, walk.
That's a fantastic idea.
(Laughing)

378
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:07,560
Let's go! Come on!
Wake the hell up,
will ya, Homer?

379
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,890
I got about as much chance
of winnin' that science fair...

380
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:12,230
as you do winnin'
a football scholarship.

381
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,230
I know I'm gonna be
a miner.

382
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,730
I've known my entire life.

383
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:18,730
What the hell's so bad
about minin' coal?

384
00:23:18,810 --> 00:23:20,740
Nothin', Roy Lee.
Coal minin's great.

385
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:25,120
That's why your step daddy’s
the biggest drunk
in West Virginia.

386
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:29,450
I mean, come on, guys!
You know the mine'll kill ya.

387
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,370
Did you ever hear the story
about how O'Dell's dad died?

388
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,920
- Homer,
will you forget it, man?
- Shut up, Homer.

389
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:39,800
Apiece of slate
caught him right in the neck
and cut his head clear off.

390
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:42,050
Bitch! Come on!
(Grunting)

391
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,590
O'Dell!

392
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:47,680
(Car Horn Honking)
Get off of me!

393
00:23:47,710 --> 00:23:50,600
Hey, fellas.
We're lookin' for U.S. 52.

394
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:54,770
(Engine Revving)

395
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,900
Uh, fellas?

396
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:01,740
Uh, just, uh, stay left
at the fork. It's about another
five miles straight ahead.

397
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:03,650
Thanks.

398
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,040
You fellas see the way
she was lookin' at me?

399
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:19,540
Man, you all wanna
be coal miners,

400
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:22,050
you all go ahead
and be coal miners.

401
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:36,230
There. There.

402
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,290
God's honest truth, Homer,

403
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,540
what are the chances...

404
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,830
of a bunch of kids
from Coalwood...

405
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,710
actually winnin'
the National Science Fair?

406
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:02,050
A million to one, O'Dell.

407
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,880
That good?

408
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:08,470
Well, why didn't you say so?
Come on. Give me that.

409
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,310
Quentin.
(Grunts)

410
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,150
What?
(Both Chuckling)

411
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,920
We hiked eight miles
for this?

412
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:47,760
Oh, it's great.
What should we call it?

413
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,760
How 'bout a slack dump?

414
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:52,720
(O'Dell)
What about "No Man's Land'?

415
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,270
Cape Coalwood.

416
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,810
I mean, it's perfect.

417
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:00,190
We could build a blockhouse
over there...

418
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:02,190
and, and a, and a,
and a launch pad.

419
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,690
And we could even build
a test stand.!

420
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,500
(Homer's Voice)
Dear Dr. Von Braun,

421
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,920
our launch site,
which we've named Cape Coalwood,

422
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,130
is nearing completion.
(Shouting)

423
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,630
Thanks to the generosity
of local businesses.

Inspired by our efforts,

00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:45,570
everyone is anxious to help
by donating materials.

429
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:50,490
(Chattering, Laughing)
We've been fortunate to have
the support of our classmates.

430
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,070
And the whole community
here in Coalwood is behind us.

431
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:55,700
Hey, rocket boy.
Mars is that way.
(Laughing)

432
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,580
But no one has been more
encouraging to our efforts
than my father.

433
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:02,830
No, the company doesn't have
any cement left over
for launch pads.

434
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,840
I just thought I'd ask.

435
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:08,010
Besides, I told you
no more rockets.

436
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,300
Uh, you said no more rockets
on company property.

437
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:13,510
And Olga
doesn't own Snakeroot.

438
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,470
So, you walk eight miles?

439
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,470
Yes, sir.

440
00:27:21,050 --> 00:27:24,060
Well, tell me something,
Homer.

441
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:27,400
Uh, what exactly is
this Wernher von Braun...

442
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:30,150
and the rest of those Germans
accomplishin' anyway?

443
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:33,660
'Cause if you ask me,
it's nothin' but a stunt.

444
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:37,530
You think, you think catchin' up
to the Russians in space
is a stunt?

445
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:40,700
When the novelty wears off,
they're all gonna be
sent packin'.

446
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:45,630
Maybe then they'll have
to find themselves a real job.
Like minin' coal?

447
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,750
You listen here.

448
00:27:48,790 --> 00:27:52,050
The coal we mine
makes steel, Homer.

00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,550
And if steel fails,
this country fails.

450
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,260
If you had half a damn brain
in your head, you'd know that.

(Phone Ringing)

452
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:05,270
Well, who's down there now?

453
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,020
Hold on just a second.
Hey, listen here.

454
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,150
I had an engineer estimate
a new walkway.

455
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,700
They had some cement left over,

456
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:16,280
so it got caught in the rain...
it's probably ruined.

457
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,080
But if you wanna haul it out,
it's all yours.

458
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,120
Thanks, Dad.

459
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,370
I'll be down there
in a minute.

460
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:33,170
And Miss Riley wanted
to make sure you document
your results.

461
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:35,590
You will be graded
when she returns.

462
00:28:35,670 --> 00:28:37,760
You have one hour.

463
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,810
Potassium chloride
has a potassium atom.

464
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,810
If we mix it with sugar
and add heat,

465
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,600
we'll get three parts oxygen,
two parts carbon dioxide,

466
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,940
along with some
other by-products.

467
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:52,400
In other words, lots
of good expanding gases.

468
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,110
It should make
an excellent propellant.

469
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,410
It smells like candy. Ooh!

is very difficult, Homer.
I could learn.

00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:08,080
you were gonna be shootin' off
another rocket up here today.

I'm all right.

I'm sorry about that, sir.
Oh, that's all right.
That's all right.

510
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:47,050
Homer, I flew with the Red Tails
in World War II.

511
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:49,470
And seein' that rocket
come at me...

512
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:51,720
it almost
took me back there.

513
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,230
Hey, let me have
a look at that thing.

514
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,730
That's a good job
on the weld, Homer,

515
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:03,980
but the heat from the exhaust
melted the washer.

516
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,990
It's referred to
as a nozzle... uh, sir.

517
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,410
Son, you can call it
whatever you wanna call it,

518
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:15,950
but you're gonna have to have
a better steel that can take
the heat.

519
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:20,170
Now I'd say S.A.E. 10-20 bar
stock ought to do you fine.

520
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,710
And I can order it for you.
Well, that'd be great,
Mr. Bolden.

521
00:32:23,790 --> 00:32:28,430
But it's kind of expensive.
Um...

522
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,220
Twelve miles of scrap iron,
and all we gotta do
is pop it loose.

523
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:35,680
Yeah. Now what are we gonna
tell the railroad when they
catch us pryin' up the track?

524
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:39,350

See, the county's covered

are not exactly my field, son,

Can you see?

755
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,960
(O'Dell)
Uh, no. Yes.
(Roy Lee) See it?

756
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,170
Yeah, I see it.
What's the time?

757
00:47:02,250 --> 00:47:05,300
Looks like 12 seconds.
Which one of you fellas
is Homer Hickam?

758
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,930
Um, it's me, sir.
I'm Basil Thorpe
with the Bluefield Telegraph.

759
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:11,560
Can I ask you
a few questions?

760
00:47:11,630 --> 00:47:13,560
Sure.
(Chuckles)

761
00:47:13,640 --> 00:47:18,820
(Homer) "The silvery cylinder
burst forth in a fiery column
of smoke and flame,

762
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:22,280
"racing the very wind
as it soared into the sky,

763
00:47:22,350 --> 00:47:24,570
"a messenger of these
Rocket Boys of Big Creek...

764
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,320
"these boys who use
their brains, not brawn,

765
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,870
who play not football,
but with Apollo's fire."

766
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,120
(All Chuckling)
Hi, Homer.

767
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,250
Hi, Dorothy.
Would you please sign
my newspaper?

768
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,630
Sure.

769
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:42,210
I just know you're gonna be
really famous someday.

770
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:49,850
- H-O-M-E-R.
- (Dorothy Giggling)

771
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:53,850
Which one of you fellas
is Homer Hickam?

772
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:57,440
Excuse me. Excuse me.

773
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,280
Which cost the taxpayers...
What in the world
is goin' on?

774
00:48:03,350 --> 00:48:05,860
Miss Riley,
this does not concern you.

775
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,200
You have these boys
in handcuffs.

776
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:12,620
You have these boys
in handcuffs in a high school,
Mr. Turner.

777
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,830
You probably heard
about the forest fire last week
over by Welch.

778
00:48:15,910 --> 00:48:19,540
A lot of timber went up.
Mr. Turner, you take
these handcuffs off these boys.

779
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:22,210
They found a rocket
on the side of the road.

780
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:25,550
We knew it started the fire,
ma'am. What we didn't know
is where it came from,

781
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,470
till this morning.

782
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:31,510
Mr. Hickam, can you account
for all your rockets?

783
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:33,470
No, sir. I can't.

784
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:39,100
(Chattering)

785
00:48:45,850 --> 00:48:48,410
If you weren't a minor,
you'd be in the state penitentiary.

786
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,160
I know, Dad. L...
Homer, I've been
confused by you,

787
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:53,580
I've been mad as hell
at you.

788
00:48:53,650 --> 00:48:56,620
But, boy, it's the first time
in your life I've been ashamed
of you.

789
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:59,500
(Roy Lee Grunting, Yelling)

790
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:03,670
- (Grunting Continues)
- You couldn't stop, man.
You couldn't!

791
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,670
Get in the car, Homer!
(Yelling Continues)

792
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:08,680
Homer, get in the car.

793
00:49:08,710 --> 00:49:12,010
(Man Grunting)
Idiot.! I ought
to goddamn kill ya.

794
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,850
(Grunts)

795
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:21,270
We ain't at the mine now.
This ain't your business.

796
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:23,730
You get in the car
with Homer, son.

797
00:49:24,930 --> 00:49:27,530
You listen to me,
you drunken son of a bitch.

798
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:31,030
If that boy's father was alive,
he'd kick your ass.

799
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:33,200
So I'm gonna
have to do it for him.

800
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:36,830
If I see him with a bruise,
you get a scar.

801
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:39,710
If I see him with a limp,
you get crutches!

802
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,550
(John)
You hear me?
Do you hear me?

803
00:49:48,830 --> 00:49:51,430
You know,
I'm reportin' you to the union!

804
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:54,010
Screw you
and your damn union.

805
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:14,870
Your father was
one of the best men
I ever had workin' for me.

there's a chance your dad
could lose his eye.

for all of it.

Yeah. Honeymoon.
At Myrtle Beach.

890
01:02:17,710 --> 01:02:21,840
And you said,
"You always wanted diamonds.

891
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:25,720
But these are
the best I can do.
I wish they were real."

John, I never
wanted diamonds.

This whole year...

894
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,320
has been pretty rough going
down at the mine.

895

Bad tempers...

896

makes things worse.

In a way, I guess,

899
01:02:57,120 --> 01:03:01,260
I'm the one who's responsible
for what happened
to Mr. Bykovsky.

900
01:03:01,330 --> 01:03:03,760
Listen to me, Homer.

901
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,850
Last month,

902
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:12,190
I gave Ike the chance
to go back to the machine shop,

903
01:03:12,220 --> 01:03:14,190
and he turned it down.

904
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:17,570
Yeah, he stayed in the mine
'cause the money was better.

905
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:20,650
That was his decision.

906
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:24,030
You understand me?

907
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:26,030
Yes, sir.

908
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:33,370
Well, is mining coal as terrible
as you figured it'd be?

909
01:03:33,450 --> 01:03:35,880
I guess not.

910
01:03:37,450 --> 01:03:40,130
But almost.
(Laughing)

911
01:03:41,580 --> 01:03:43,550
(Coughing)

912
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:04,150
Everybody says to say hi.
Michael and Billy.

913
01:04:04,230 --> 01:04:06,410
Valentine Carmina.

914
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,410
How about Miss Riley?

915
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:13,410
She ain't been around much.
She got some new boyfriend
over in Welch.

916
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:18,170
So, uh, what's it like
down there?

917
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,170
You get used to it
after a while.

918
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:28,600
Besides, shoveling coal
has got its advantages.

919
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:31,180
Check this out.

920
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:35,140
Man, no wonder my stepdad
can slug me so good.

921
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:38,110
After a month down there,
you'd be able
to knock him out.

922
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,360
Well, I ain't
in no hurry.

923
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:48,370
(Work Whistle Blowing)

924
01:04:53,240 --> 01:04:55,710
See ya all later.
See ya, man.

925
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:57,710
See ya, Homer.

926
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:02,250
In Christ's name,
we pray. Amen.

927
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:04,260
Amen.

928
01:05:08,460 --> 01:05:11,930
We appreciate the sacrifice
you made here, Homer.

929
01:05:12,010 --> 01:05:16,480
But pretty soon,
you'll be able to go back
and finish up the school year.

930
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,810
I'm not going back
to school.

931
01:05:19,890 --> 01:05:22,320
A few weeks left in the term,

932
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:24,690
I'll just stay put.

933
01:05:24,770 --> 01:05:27,700
Well, I think you ought
to finish high school.

934
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:32,740
Well, tell him, John.

935
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,870
Homer's not a boy anymore.

936
01:05:39,070 --> 01:05:42,040
I don't think
I can tell him anything.

937
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:44,050
(Dishes Clattering)

938
01:05:54,630 --> 01:05:58,770
(Jake) All I'm saying, John,
is the cutoff was not done
proper according to contract.

939
01:05:58,840 --> 01:06:00,770
Well, the company did
what it had to do.

940
01:06:00,850 --> 01:06:03,320
Well, you know the union
won't put up with it.

941
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:07,530
Just give it a rest, Jake.
It's my first day back.

942
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:16,370
Hey, Lenny,
how's he doing?

943
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:18,460
He's a chip
off the old block, John.

944
01:06:18,530 --> 01:06:21,540
It's good
to have you back.
(Chuckling) Thank you.

945
01:06:25,830 --> 01:06:30,510
Hi.
I'm headed toward the face.
You wanna come along?

946
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:37,390
(John)
Even though I don't have
that piece of paper...

947
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:40,770
the thing from college...
they listen to me.

948
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,770
You know why?

949
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:45,770
'Cause you know more
than they do.

950
01:06:45,850 --> 01:06:49,070
You bet your life
I do. Homer.

951
01:06:49,140 --> 01:06:52,910
I know the mine
like I know a man.

952
01:06:52,980 --> 01:06:56,740
Heck, I can take
one look around here...
(Coughing)

953
01:06:58,570 --> 01:07:00,910
Are you all right?

954
01:07:00,950 --> 01:07:03,250
Yeah, I'm not afraid
of a little coal dust.

955
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,340
Hell, Homer,
I was born for this.

956
01:07:06,410 --> 01:07:10,260
I guess
it shouldn't surprise me
that you were too.

957
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:12,930
Let's go watch 'em
shoot some coal.

958
01:07:20,300 --> 01:07:24,730
Elsie, hold dinner
for a while, will you?

959
01:07:24,760 --> 01:07:27,230
I have to make a call.

960
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,570
Homer,

961
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:40,330
I was in the store today,
and I heard some talk.

962
01:07:53,120 --> 01:07:56,470
Boy, it's sure hard
to keep a secret in this town,
isn't it?

963
01:07:56,540 --> 01:07:59,560
But I guess I did
a pretty good job.

964
01:07:59,630 --> 01:08:04,520
You know, there's a rumor going
around that I been sneaking off
to Welch to see some beau.

965
01:08:04,590 --> 01:08:07,520
I wish that rumor'd
been true.
Yeah.

966
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:12,860
They told me Hodgkin's
can go into remission,
so I might have some time.

967
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:15,490
Is there anything I can do,
Miss Riley?

968
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:18,870
You can accept
my apology.

969
01:08:18,940 --> 01:08:21,660
For what?

970
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:24,160
My life's work
is teaching.

971
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:27,710
And I believed
that if you boys won
that science fair,

972
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:32,670
got scholarships, went off
and did something great
with your lives,

973
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:35,550
somehow my life
would have counted
for something.

974
01:08:37,630 --> 01:08:39,560
Homer.

975
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:44,730
You know what?

976
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:49,690
Sometimes you really
can't listen to what
anybody else says.

977
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:52,780
You just gotta
listen inside.

978
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:55,860
You're not supposed to
end up in those mines.

979
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:59,410
You know why?
'Cause I think
you made other plans.

980
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:02,910
I want you
to know something.

981
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:07,250
I'm proud of you.
I am.

982
01:09:07,320 --> 01:09:10,210
Whatever you choose.

983
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:44,240
(Ringing)

984
01:09:56,960 --> 01:09:59,430
(Mine Alarm Blaring)

985
01:10:51,470 --> 01:10:56,020
Excuse me, ma'am,
is Quentin home?

986
01:11:00,850 --> 01:11:02,410
Quentin.

987
01:11:07,240 --> 01:11:11,250
Homer, y-you figured
this equation out
by yourself?

988
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:15,000
Well, if I did the math right.
It proves that you can't...

989
01:11:15,080 --> 01:11:18,050
l-It proves we didn't
start that fire!
Quentin, what're you doin'?

990
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,630
Now, the AUKXIII was
the only one that we couldn't
find that day.

991
01:11:21,670 --> 01:11:24,300
And our best guess
for fall time
with the AUKXII,

992
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:27,430
which is exactly identical,
was about 14 seconds.

993
01:11:27,510 --> 01:11:29,850
If you help me
with the trig part,
Quentin,

994
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:33,600
we should be able
to make a good guess
where that rocket landed.

995
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:49,870
Six thousand,
three hundred
and twenty-eight feet.

996
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:53,710
One point two miles.

997
01:11:55,030 --> 01:11:57,000
Homer?
Yeah?

998
01:11:59,620 --> 01:12:04,300
Are you gonna tell
Roy Lee and O'Dell
where I live?

999
01:12:04,380 --> 01:12:09,310
It wouldn't matter
if you lived
in the governor's mansion,

1000
01:12:09,380 --> 01:12:13,020
they'd still think
you're weird.

1001
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:20,280
I'll see you at dawn.

1002
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:23,110
Don't you have to go
to the mine?

1003
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:25,610
I don't work there
anymore.

1004
01:12:41,120 --> 01:12:43,090
One.

1005
01:12:49,920 --> 01:12:51,890
Two.

1006
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,280
Ninety-nine.

1007
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:09,070
A hundred seven.

1008
01:13:28,590 --> 01:13:30,850
One hundred
and twenty-six.

1009
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,810
That's 6,300 feet.

1010
01:13:34,840 --> 01:13:37,190
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

1011
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:04,000
What'd we do wrong?

1012
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:07,880
I don't know.
L-I'll check the math again.

1013
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:19,850
Was there a wind
that day?

1014
01:14:19,930 --> 01:14:22,270
L-I don't remember.

1015
01:14:22,350 --> 01:14:24,530
'Cause if there was,

1016
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:27,190
the wind probably came
from the west...

1017
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:29,820
which means that
it would've pushed
the rocket...

1018
01:14:32,020 --> 01:14:33,950
right there.

1019
01:14:38,200 --> 01:14:40,540
Prodigious.

1020
01:14:40,570 --> 01:14:43,460
...associated...

1021
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:45,460
(Students Murmuring)

1022
01:14:49,080 --> 01:14:52,550
Mr. Hayes,
where you off to
in such a hurry?

1023
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:55,390
Okay, everybody,
back in your seats.

1024
01:14:55,460 --> 01:14:59,940
Miss Stanton, Miss Blue,
let's go, back in your seats.
Mr. Hancock.

1025
01:15:01,010 --> 01:15:03,110
That goes for you too,
Mr. Wilson.

1026
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:09,570
Miss Riley,
what's going on in here?

1027
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:13,410
They didn't start
that fire, Mr. Turner.

1028
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:16,240
In the first place,
you are not a member
of this classroom.

1029
01:15:16,280 --> 01:15:18,330
Neither are you,
Mr. Turner.
(Students Chuckling)

1030
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,330
Why don't you let the boy
defend himself?

1031
01:15:20,410 --> 01:15:24,460
And in the second place,
this rocket proves nothing.

1032
01:15:24,530 --> 01:15:27,340
You've already admitted
having lost a number
of your rockets.

1033
01:15:27,410 --> 01:15:29,460
You cannot prove
conclusively...

1034
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:33,010
that another one of them
didn't start that fire.
Yes, I can.

1035
01:15:39,970 --> 01:15:42,560
Are we to conclude,
Mr. Hickam, that
since leaving school,

1036
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:45,940
you've not only become an expert
in rocket science, but in
the field of trigonometry?

1037
01:15:45,970 --> 01:15:47,940
I didn't say
that I was a rock...
Obviously, you learned more...

1038
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:50,780
in the coal mines
than you did in high school.
(Students Chuckling)

1039
01:15:50,810 --> 01:15:55,320
Let the boy talk.
Go ahead, Homer.

1040
01:15:55,400 --> 01:15:59,410
Now, that fire was near Welch,
just under three miles
from our launch pad.

1041
01:15:59,490 --> 01:16:04,120
And at the time of the fire,
the best that we could do
was 1.2 miles...

1042
01:16:04,200 --> 01:16:06,840
which is exactly where we found
that rocket, Mr. Turner.

1043
01:16:06,910 --> 01:16:11,130
See, Mr. Turner, that rocket
fell for about 14 seconds,
which means...

1044
01:16:11,210 --> 01:16:13,880
that it flew to an altitude
of 3,000 feet...

1045
01:16:13,960 --> 01:16:16,510
according to the equation...

1046
01:16:16,590 --> 01:16:19,970
"S" equals one-half"A"
"T" squared...

1047
01:16:20,050 --> 01:16:23,600
where "S'is the altitude,
A'is the gravity constant...
or 32...

1048
01:16:23,680 --> 01:16:26,310
and "T" is the time
it took for that rocket
to come back down.

1049
01:16:26,390 --> 01:16:29,400
Velocity equals
acceleration times time.
Get him, Homer, get him.

1050
01:16:29,470 --> 01:16:31,740
Are you following this,
Mr. Turner?
(Students Chuckling)

1051
01:16:31,810 --> 01:16:34,910
All right,
we're all duly impressed.

1052
01:16:34,980 --> 01:16:39,030
But do you mind telling me,
if you did not start that fire,
who did?

1053
01:16:39,110 --> 01:16:41,200
(Phone Ringing)

1054
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:43,330
What is it?

1055
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:47,750
Whatever it is,
i-it's ingenious.
The fins are spring-loaded.

1056
01:16:47,830 --> 01:16:50,050
That isn't a rocket
at all.

1057
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:52,550
It's an aeronautical flare.

1058
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:58,720
There's an airport here
in Welch. It's right above
where the fire started.

1059
01:17:08,050 --> 01:17:11,900
Mr. Hickam,
report to my office as soon
as we return to school.

1060
01:17:11,980 --> 01:17:16,110
You do intend to enter
the county science fair,
do you not?

1061
01:17:16,190 --> 01:17:18,320
Yes, sir, we do.

1062
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:21,030
Well, if you intend
to represent Big Creek,

1063
01:17:21,110 --> 01:17:24,040
you're gonna have to be
enrolled as a student
at Big Creek.

1064
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:26,040
(Engine Starting)

1065
01:17:26,110 --> 01:17:29,540
"Prodigenous."

1066
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:34,550
(Homer) Do you think
you can draw well enough
so Mr. Bolden could build it?

1067
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:36,550
Yep.
Let me see.

1068
01:17:36,620 --> 01:17:39,300
Yeah.
Hey, Homer.

1069
01:17:39,380 --> 01:17:42,560
- Hi, Dad.
- What's this stuff doin' here?

1070
01:17:42,590 --> 01:17:45,890
Mr. Hickam, we didn't
start the fire.
The troopers gave it back to us.

1071
01:17:45,970 --> 01:17:48,270
Yeah, it wasn't even
one of our rockets.
It was an aeronautical flare.

1072
01:17:48,340 --> 01:17:50,400
Y'all go on home now.

1073
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:52,400
Yes, sir.

1074
01:18:08,990 --> 01:18:13,550
This the reason
you skipped work today?
Yes, sir.

1075
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:20,970
I thought you put
all this nonsense
behind you, Homer.

1076
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:23,680
I thought you weren't
gonna be doin' it...
Dad, it isn't nonsense.

1077
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:26,100
L-I don't wanna
argue with you.

1078
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:28,560
Look, son,

1079
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:32,230
I can't even begin to tell you
how proud of you I've been
these past weeks.

1080
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:37,110
I mean, you've just been
doin' a hell of a job
in that mine.

1081
01:18:37,190 --> 01:18:40,030
You keep goin',
you're gonna have
my job someday.

1082
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:43,280
Everybody says so.

1083
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,450
You got any idea how proud
that would make me?

1084
01:18:48,740 --> 01:18:50,750
Dad, what l...
(Stammering)

1085
01:18:50,820 --> 01:18:56,510
I guess what I'm sayin' is,
is that if this rocket stuff
is so important to you,

1086
01:18:56,580 --> 01:19:00,470
then so be it,
as long as you're careful.

1087
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,220
Guess there's worse hobbies
you could have.

1088
01:19:03,290 --> 01:19:07,140
But skippin'work,
that's out of line.

1089
01:19:07,170 --> 01:19:09,940
And you gotta know that.

1090
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:13,690
So let's go
and get you right
with Jake.

1091
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,570
Tell him you'll work
the hoot owl shift tonight.

1092
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:17,990
No.

1093
01:19:22,110 --> 01:19:25,700
The coal mine's your life.
It's not mine.

1094
01:19:31,450 --> 01:19:34,330
I'm never going
down there again.

1095
01:19:40,370 --> 01:19:42,840
I wanna go into space.

1096
01:20:06,150 --> 01:20:10,120
(Man)
Homer Hickam, Roy Lee Cook,
Quentin Wilson...

1097
01:20:10,200 --> 01:20:12,410
and Sherman O'Dell
of Big Creek High...

1098
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:15,380
for their ingenious display
of amateur rocket-building
techniques.

1099
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:37,980
I can't believe
we beat the kid
with the robot dog.

1100
01:20:38,060 --> 01:20:41,690
And I thought
the see-through ear
was gonna win.

1101
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:44,280
I got Miss Wade workin'
on your travel arrangements,

1102
01:20:44,350 --> 01:20:48,280
so you boys are gonna
have to decide who's goin'
to Indianapolis.

1103
01:20:48,360 --> 01:20:51,080
We're all goin'.
Yeah.

1104
01:20:51,110 --> 01:20:55,000
Son, I wish you could,
but we can't afford
to send all four of you.

1105
01:20:55,070 --> 01:20:59,130
Only one. Let me know
what you decide. I'm gonna
have to know by Friday.

1106
01:20:59,200 --> 01:21:02,210
You boys did
a fine job today.

1107
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:16,520
I need to borrow a suitcase,
and I'm gonna need
you guys' addresses...

1108
01:21:16,590 --> 01:21:19,940
because I'm gonna
write some postcards.
Oh, you shut up, Roy Lee.

1109
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:23,030
Come on, you dope.
You know, you're goin',
Homer.

1110
01:21:23,100 --> 01:21:25,030
Yeah.
Yeah.

1111
01:21:25,100 --> 01:21:28,280
Say hello
to the outside world
for us.

1112
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:30,620
Do we know
what we want?
(All) Yeah!

1113
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:32,450
Are we gettin' it?
(All) No!

1114
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:36,420
All right!
All in favor of goin' out
on strike, say "aye"!

1115
01:21:36,450 --> 01:21:37,920
(All)
Aye!

1116
01:21:37,950 --> 01:21:40,290
All right, let's go.!
(Shouting)

1117
01:21:40,370 --> 01:21:43,210
All right, shut 'em down.!
Let's go.!

1118
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:47,470
Strike.! Strike.!
Strike.!

1119
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,470
(Shouting Continues)

1120
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:07,150
Well, they sure are
gettin' themselves
worked up.

1121
01:22:07,230 --> 01:22:09,160
Everybody's sayin'
this one's gonna be
a long one.

1122
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:12,280
And it will,
if I have anything
to say about it.

1123
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,330
Ungrateful
sons of bitches.

1124
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:18,170
Mom, have you seen
the big green suitcase?
Did you look in the attic?

1125
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:22,420
Yes, ma'am.
Well, I don't know. John,
you know where the suitcase is?

1126
01:22:24,660 --> 01:22:28,260
How the hell should I know
where the suitcase is?

1127
01:22:28,330 --> 01:22:30,340
I don't know, sug.

1128
01:22:30,420 --> 01:22:32,350
(Mother Murmuring)

1129
01:22:35,670 --> 01:22:37,730
(Sighing)

1130
01:22:42,850 --> 01:22:44,900
(Gunshot,
Glass Shattering)

1131
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:48,700
- John!
- Y'all stay inside!

1132
01:22:50,730 --> 01:22:55,120
(Tires Screeching)
Vernon!

1133
01:22:55,190 --> 01:22:57,290
(Jim)
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch.!

1134
01:22:57,360 --> 01:22:59,370
Oh, don't be
a damn fool.

1135
01:22:59,450 --> 01:23:04,210
All right, well,
what are we gonna do?
Nothin'.

1136
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:07,970
Drunken bastard couldn't hit
the broad side of a barn.

1137
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,180
He tried to kill you, Dad.
Yeah, Dad,
you can't just stand...

1138
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:13,050
Hey, hey, don't
trouble yourself, Homer.

1139
01:23:13,130 --> 01:23:15,640
You got
more important things
to worry about.

1140
01:23:15,710 --> 01:23:19,480
(John)
Just go look
for your suitcase.

1141
01:23:23,300 --> 01:23:26,320
Forget about it, Homer.

1142
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:28,320
Shut up, Jim!

1143
01:23:28,390 --> 01:23:33,450
Listen, I'm sorry about
what's goin' on around here,
but it isn't my fault!

1144
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:36,540
What do you want
from me anyway?
Better watch yourself, Homer!

1145
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:39,080
If I win at Indianapolis,
maybe I can go to college,

1146
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:41,210
maybe even get a job
at Cape Canaveral!

1147
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:44,500
There's nothing here for me.!
The town is dyin'!

1148
01:23:44,580 --> 01:23:46,840
The mine is dyin'!
Everybody knows it here
but you!

1149
01:23:46,910 --> 01:23:50,300
You wanna get out of here
so bad, then go! Go!

1150
01:23:50,370 --> 01:23:51,680
Yeah, I'll go!
Yeah, I'll go!

1151
01:23:51,750 --> 01:23:53,090
Go, go!
I'll go!

1152
01:23:53,130 --> 01:23:58,350
And I'll be gone forever!
I won't even look back!

1153
01:24:01,260 --> 01:24:03,650
(Door Slamming)

1154
01:24:41,550 --> 01:24:43,980
(Man)
Welcome to Indianapolis.!

1155
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:47,110
Visitors to the fair
will include prominent members
of every branch...

1156
01:24:47,140 --> 01:24:49,440
of the national
scientific community.

1157
01:24:49,470 --> 01:24:51,820
The fair will be open
to the public
over the next two days.

1158
01:24:51,850 --> 01:24:56,820
The following day,
the judges will arrive
to select the winners.

1159
01:24:56,900 --> 01:25:02,000
By timing the rocket's descent,
we would be able to figure out
just how high the rocket flew.

1160
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:07,670
Would you like to see?
This is a Delaval nozzle.

1161
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:09,920
Do any of y'all know
what a Delaval noz...

1162
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:23,390
Two, please.
The judges always go
for the most expensive exhibits.

1163
01:25:23,470 --> 01:25:25,390
That guy with
the biosphere's gonna win.

1164
01:25:25,470 --> 01:25:29,360
I don't think so.
My money's on the kid
with the rocket display.

1165
01:25:29,390 --> 01:25:32,360
Have you seen it yet?
It's really cool.

1166
01:25:37,360 --> 01:25:40,080
(Woman On P.A.)
Mr. Owens,
to the security office.

1167
01:25:40,150 --> 01:25:42,330
Mr. Owens,
to the security office, please.

1168
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:55,090
It's not like we got a hell
of a lot of time, Roy Lee.
The judging is tomorrow.

1169
01:25:55,160 --> 01:25:57,090
There's nothin' we can do
without Mr. Bolden.

1170
01:25:57,170 --> 01:25:59,470
And he can't get anywhere
near the machine shop.

1171
01:25:59,540 --> 01:26:03,430
They even took my picture
of Dr. Von Braun.

1172
01:26:03,510 --> 01:26:05,430
They stole everything.

1173
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,770
(Car Horn Honking)

1174
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:17,150
Leon, what are you doing
back here?

1175
01:26:17,230 --> 01:26:19,360
You know you shouldn't
be seen back here.

1176
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:21,740
I know, Elsie,
but Homer's in trouble.

1177
01:26:23,610 --> 01:26:25,580
(Shouting)

1178
01:26:36,710 --> 01:26:41,010
Elsie, I don't have the power
to settle this strike.

1179
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:44,010
The bosses listen to you.
They'll do what you tell 'em.

1180
01:26:44,090 --> 01:26:46,640
I am not gonna crawl
on my belly...

1181
01:26:46,720 --> 01:26:50,270
in front of those
miserable union rats.

1182
01:26:50,350 --> 01:26:53,110
Is that what this
is about, John?
Is this about your pride?

1183
01:26:53,140 --> 01:26:55,610
No, it's about what's best
for Coalwood.

1184
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:00,740
If this mine
doesn't produce,
then the town dies.

1185
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:04,660
Think the union gives
a good damn about that?

1186
01:27:04,730 --> 01:27:07,290
They're nothin'
but a bunch of greedy
sons of bitches that...

1187
01:27:07,360 --> 01:27:09,290
Shut up, John.
Just shut up.

1188
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:12,540
Homer once said
you love the mine more
than your own family.

1189
01:27:12,620 --> 01:27:15,050
And I took up for you
'cause I didn't wanna
believe it.

1190
01:27:15,120 --> 01:27:18,090
Homer has gotten a lot of help
from the people in this town.

1191
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:21,260
They've helped him build
his rockets, they've gone out
there and watched him fly 'em.

1192
01:27:21,330 --> 01:27:25,640
But not you, John.
You never showed up.
Not even once.

1193
01:27:25,710 --> 01:27:27,770
Now, I'm not asking you
to believe in him,

1194
01:27:27,840 --> 01:27:30,560
but he's your son,
for God's sake, John.

1195
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:33,730
And I am askin' you
to help him.

1196
01:27:33,810 --> 01:27:35,730
If you don't,
I'll leave you.

1197
01:27:35,810 --> 01:27:38,650
I'll find work.
I'll do whatever it takes
to get away from here.

1198
01:27:38,730 --> 01:27:44,030
I'll live in a tree
to get away from you.
Don't you think I won't.

1199
01:27:45,780 --> 01:27:47,700
Where would you go?

1200
01:27:50,150 --> 01:27:52,120
Myrtle Beach.

1201
01:27:55,620 --> 01:27:59,550
(Door Opens, Closes)

1202
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:08,720
I guess we all know
this isn't gonna fix things,

1203
01:28:08,800 --> 01:28:11,230
uh, at least not for long.

1204
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:13,850
We know you did
what you could for us.

1205
01:28:13,930 --> 01:28:16,060
Jake.
Thanks.

1206
01:28:16,140 --> 01:28:18,030
Leon.

1207
01:28:18,100 --> 01:28:20,030
Yes, John.

1208
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:25,240
Don't you have
some work to do?

1209
01:28:37,700 --> 01:28:40,550
It's packed and shipped
and on its way. Be at
the bus station, 8:00 a.m.

1210
01:28:40,620 --> 01:28:43,380
Okay, Mom,
but how'd you...
Your father, Homer.

1211
01:28:43,460 --> 01:28:45,720
It was your father.
Give 'em hell, Homer!

1212
01:28:45,750 --> 01:28:47,720
(Cheering)

1213
01:28:50,630 --> 01:28:53,690
- Good luck, sweetie.
- Bye.

1214
01:28:55,050 --> 01:28:56,980
(Coin Clinks)

1215
01:29:06,940 --> 01:29:08,910
Thanks, Dad.

1216
01:29:22,160 --> 01:29:25,180
(Homer) When
the rocket propellant burns,
it produces a river of gas...

1217
01:29:25,250 --> 01:29:27,720
which flows through
the convergent section
of the nozzle.

1218
01:29:27,790 --> 01:29:30,100
If the river continues
through the nozzle,

1219
01:29:30,130 --> 01:29:32,140
but through the throat
at less than sonic speed...

1220
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:34,730
that is to say, less than
the speed of sound...

1221
01:29:34,800 --> 01:29:38,150
it becomes compact in the...
compacted in the divergent
section,

1222
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:40,150
bound in turmoil
and inefficient.

1223
01:29:40,220 --> 01:29:44,820
Lyle Wells and Jean Cooper,
Schrader High School,
McMinnville, Oregon.

1224
01:30:03,080 --> 01:30:06,970
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
the big moment.

1225
01:30:07,040 --> 01:30:10,720
The Highest Scholastic
Achievement Award
for Science.

1226
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:14,310
The National Science Fair
first prize gold medal...

1227
01:30:14,380 --> 01:30:16,890
goes to Homer Hickam,

1228
01:30:16,970 --> 01:30:20,270
Quentin Wilson, Roy Lee Cook
and Sherman O'Dell,

1229
01:30:20,310 --> 01:30:24,440
Big Creek High School,
McDowell County, West Virginia.

1230
01:30:56,170 --> 01:30:59,560
Tom Webster of Virginia State
College. I wanna talk to you
about a scholarship.

1231
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:03,770
Jack Palmer, Virginia Tech.
We got the best science program
in the state, buddy, okay?

1232
01:31:03,850 --> 01:31:07,820
Congratulations, son.
Good luck to you.

1233
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,120
What did he say to you?
What did who say?

1234
01:31:13,190 --> 01:31:18,910
Von Braun.
That was Wernher von Braun.
You just shook his hand.

1235
01:31:26,660 --> 01:31:29,720
(Cheering)

1236
01:31:36,090 --> 01:31:39,310
Oh, Homer,
I'm so proud of you.
Thanks, Mom.

1237
01:31:39,380 --> 01:31:42,730
He's not here, hon.

1238
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:45,230
Where's Miss Riley?

1239
01:32:01,780 --> 01:32:03,750
Hello, Miss Riley.

1240
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:08,670
Hi, Homer.

1241
01:32:08,750 --> 01:32:10,670
Hi.
Hi.

1242
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:16,350
Oh!
You did it!

1243
01:32:16,420 --> 01:32:19,520
I knew you would.

1244
01:32:19,590 --> 01:32:23,520
The Rocket Boys
are goin' to college.

1245
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,270
We all got scholarships.
(Chuckling)

1246
01:32:26,350 --> 01:32:28,780
And you know what?

1247
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:33,990
From now on,
every school year,

1248
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:36,490
I'm gonna brag
to all my new students...

1249
01:32:36,570 --> 01:32:40,200
about how I taught
Homer Hickam
and the Rocket Boys.

1250
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:42,830
Maybe one day,

1251
01:32:42,910 --> 01:32:47,130
one of them'll feel
like they can do
what y'all did.

1252
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:01,680
You know, just,
stuff like that
takes time.

1253
01:33:07,310 --> 01:33:09,230
Will you let me out?

1254
01:33:16,060 --> 01:33:20,830
(John)
What are they doin;
charging Olga for that.

1255
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:23,540
Hell, I'm going to salvage
something up here?

1256
01:33:23,610 --> 01:33:25,620
Hey, Dad. Hi.
Hello, Homer.

1257
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:29,340
I just wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate
what you did for me.

1258
01:33:29,410 --> 01:33:33,420
I know it wasn't easy for you,
so thank you.

1259
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:36,180
A-And we're shootin' off
our last rocket today at 5:00,

1260
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,810
so if you'd like to come
see it...
I got a lot of work to do.

1261
01:33:39,840 --> 01:33:43,180
All right. Well,
I just thought I'd ask.

1262
01:33:45,930 --> 01:33:48,360
Hear you met
your big hero.

1263
01:33:50,680 --> 01:33:52,860
Didn't even know it.

1264
01:33:59,610 --> 01:34:01,540
Look,

1265
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:04,540
I know you and me
don't exactly see eye to eye
on certain things.

1266
01:34:04,610 --> 01:34:09,210
I mean,
we don't see eye to eye
on just about anything.

1267
01:34:09,280 --> 01:34:14,010
But Dad, I come to believe
that I got it in me to be
somebody in this world.

1268
01:34:14,040 --> 01:34:16,880
A-And it's not because
I'm so different
from you either.

1269
01:34:16,960 --> 01:34:19,390
It's 'cause
I'm the same.

1270
01:34:19,420 --> 01:34:24,140
You know, I can be
just as hardheaded
and just as tough.

1271
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:28,440
I only hope I can be
as good a man as you are.

1272
01:34:28,510 --> 01:34:31,570
I mean, sure,

1273
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:35,190
Dr. Von Braun's
a great scientist,

1274
01:34:35,230 --> 01:34:37,700
but he isn't my hero.

1275
01:35:07,970 --> 01:35:09,940
(Elevator Buzzes)

1276
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:43,800
It's our last rocket.
Yeah, let's do it.

1277
01:35:43,880 --> 01:35:46,810
Wire it up for me, will ya?
I gotta do something.
Yeah.

1278
01:35:48,800 --> 01:35:50,940
Hi, Homer.
Hi.

1279
01:35:50,970 --> 01:35:53,860
Congratulations
on winning
the science fair.

1280
01:35:53,930 --> 01:35:57,190
It's gotta be the most
exciting thing that's ever
happened around here.

1281
01:35:57,270 --> 01:36:00,490
Um, I was thinking,
Homer, if, if you've
got some time...

1282
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:04,320
Excuse me, Dorothy.
Hi.
Hi.

1283
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:11,920
Good luck.
Thanks.
(Clears Throat)

1284
01:36:11,990 --> 01:36:14,460
Hey, everybody, can we have
your attention, please?

1285
01:36:14,530 --> 01:36:16,550
Come on, Homer,
let her fly!

1286
01:36:16,620 --> 01:36:20,260
We're gonna launch the rocket
in a minute, but we'd like
to say thank you first.

1287
01:36:20,330 --> 01:36:24,720
If it wasn't for y'all,
we'd never have gotten
into any science fair.

1288
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:27,680
We'd probably never have
gotten past blowin' up
my mom's fence.

1289
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:30,100
(Laughing)
But we did...

1290
01:36:30,170 --> 01:36:33,730
because of your help
and support.

1291
01:36:33,800 --> 01:36:36,230
And this is for Coalwood.

1292
01:36:41,230 --> 01:36:45,030
There are a few people
who believed in us
even before we did.

1293
01:36:45,060 --> 01:36:48,660
We'd like to dedicate
this rocket to them.

1294
01:36:48,740 --> 01:36:51,290
To Ike Bykovsky.

1295
01:36:54,240 --> 01:36:57,250
To Mr. Bolden,
who helped us so much.

1296
01:36:59,870 --> 01:37:02,840
To the person
who first inspired us,

1297
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:05,390
our teacher, Miss Riley.

1298
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:12,730
And, finally, I'd like
to dedicate this rocket
to my mom and to...

1299
01:37:17,850 --> 01:37:19,780
my dad.

1300
01:37:34,570 --> 01:37:38,630
You know, it, uh, won't fly
unless somebody pushes
the button.

1301
01:37:41,870 --> 01:37:44,010
It's yours,
if you want it.

1302
01:38:07,150 --> 01:38:10,330
Ten, nine...
(Together)
Eight,

1303
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:13,000
seven, six, five,

1304
01:38:13,070 --> 01:38:16,790
four, three, two, one.

1305
01:38:33,210 --> 01:38:37,350
Look at it go, Homer.
