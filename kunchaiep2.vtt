00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.000
If anyone knew that you were homosexual, it would be ruined

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:22.400
But you're my brother and you acted like someone else

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:37.400
just because I'm not a real man.
So you would understand how I feel.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.200
What're you doing? You're acting as the lead actress of the live performance

00:00:40.201 --> 00:00:42.400
Can you perform for me? I want to watch you.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.400
Why did you wrap your head with a scarf like that? Where did you get it?

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.200
This is bad. Tian is about to be like Mr.Zhang.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.800
You can't do this again, you hear me?

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.000
Don't

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.700
Burn it.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.600
Everyone said that it was a secret.

00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:59.000
A stick and a piece of fabric?

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.200
It must be something important and wicked for sure.

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:02.600
What're you hiding? Let me see.

00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:03.600
I won't.

00:01:03.601 --> 00:01:05.000
Please / Give it to me.

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.000
You can't mess with Tian again.
Ouch!

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.300
You should focus only raising a good son.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.800
When I forbid you and you didn't listen to me, it will be a punishment.

00:01:12.801 --> 00:01:17.000
I told you that you'd be in trouble if someone knew about it

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.000
Madame!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:27.000
Tian! Tian.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.200
Where're Tian?

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.400
Tian! 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
There're some situations.

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.200
You accused me of cheating?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.400
You! Ouch!

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.400
I cheated?/Stop.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
What's going on?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.600
Why were you two in a fight like this?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.700
Dong frauded me. 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
You accepted money from me already.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.400
Don't listen to him.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
He could spend it on liquor or something else.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.600
You wanted to reimburse more?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.800
That's not true. Dong is a cheater.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.600
I'll use that money to cure my mother. She is sick.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.200
Please, bring me justice.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.600
Take this and get up.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.400
I heard noises, what's going on?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.200
They fought because of wages.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Dong said that he already paid Zhao.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.000
But Zhao said that he didn't get money from Dong.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.400
What about that money?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.600
It's mine.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.400
Zhao said that he'd use it to heal his sick mother. So I gave it to him.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.000
How could you let this happen?

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.600
Did you have any proof that you paid him?

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.400
But I paid him already.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Everybody, listen.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.600
From now on, come to me to get your wages.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.400
I'll take care of payment instead of Dong.

00:06:19.401 --> 00:06:21.800
So you believed Zhao

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.600
and accused me of cheating about wages?

00:06:23.601 --> 00:06:24.600
That's enough.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.000
Tian tried to build a system to this.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.000
You should do what he said.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.000
Well done. 

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.200
Thank you.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:55.400
Where's my son?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.000
I don't know.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.200
Flowers. / You want some gourd?

00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:05.000
You want some flowers?

00:07:05.001 --> 00:07:09.000
We have roses, how many'd you like?

00:07:09.001 --> 00:07:11.000
Can I have three please? / Sure.

00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:14.000
Lotus is pretty too, I'll take two / Sure.

00:07:14.001 --> 00:07:15.000
Pandan? / I'll take this one too.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.500
Ouch! 

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.600
You slapped me?

00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:28.000
Help me! Ouch! Help!

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.000
Who're you ?

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.000
You piece of crap! You hurt women!

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.000
You! Ouch!

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.200
Yeah?

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.100
Hey!

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.000
Ouch! 

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.100
Hey!

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.000
Hey! / Ouch! 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.000
Hey! / Water!

00:08:09.001 --> 00:08:13.000
Hey! / What?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.400
You're asking for it 

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:21.400
Here. Keep it.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.300
You want these? / Ouch!

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000
You're so good at this. 

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.500
Where's Yang?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.000
I've been waiting for him to join the table and he didn't show up.

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.000
You should teach him about this.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Yes, sir.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.700
He must be out and about like he used to. 

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.300
If you're hungry, then we should start.

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:23.300
Nope. I'll wait for him.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.300
I want to see his face

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:29.400
when he comes back and sees that everyone is waiting for him. 

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
I hope that he didn't go out and get in a fight with anyone.

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.400
I'm so sick of him already.

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.400
They're all here? 

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.200
Yang? Everyone is waiting for you.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:15.000
Nuan.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.600
Let's go. 

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.300
I knew it.

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:40.000
Whom were you in a fight with? There're bruises. 

00:10:40.001 --> 00:10:42.000
Don't scold him. Please listen to him.

00:10:42.001 --> 00:10:45.000
I won't. Why would I ? 

00:10:45.001 --> 00:10:48.400
We can see evidence on his face. He was in a fight with someone

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.400
You're useless. 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.400
You didn't pay attention in school and you only focused on shooting and fishing. 

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.400
Don't ever think about comparing yourself to Tian.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.500
You can't even compare yourself to the pier's workers.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.800
Listen to me.

00:11:06.801 --> 00:11:11.000
You can't go out and get in a fight with anyone anymore.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.000
You need to stay home, you hear me?

00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.400
I think we should start eating.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.200
Then we can start talking about something else. Go sit with me.

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.000
Never mind.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.600
I think I should go. If I stayed here, dad wouldn't be able to eat.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:36.800
And I want to think about working.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.300
I'm afraid that if I help you with work,
the successful business could be a failure. I should go.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.300
Yang? / Don't 

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.400
Let him go. Let him starve to death. 

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.300
He's so cocky. Let's eat.

00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.600
It smells so good.

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.400
I'm sorry.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.400
You have to cook for me again. I'm sorry about that.

00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.200
Well, you shouldn't argue with your dad too often.

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:36.200
Can I help?

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.000
I'm almost done.

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.000
I knew that you would ask Bua to feed you.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.000
What's wrong with your face?

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.500
Answer me nicely.

00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:03.400
I got in a fight with Japanese soldiers.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:07.000
I saw them hurting a woman and I couldn't help it. 

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.800
So I taught them a lesson or two. 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.600
Why didn't you tell dad about this?

00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:14.400
If he knew the real reason, he wouldn't have scolded you like that.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.600
What about work?

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.200
You know that I've never wanted to work since the beginning.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.000
We were raised to hate each other.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.200
My mom raised me to hate you and your mom was no different.

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.800
If I worked there,

00:13:30.801 --> 00:13:33.400
my mom would pressure me to compete with you.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.200
If I agreed with mom,

00:13:36.201 --> 00:13:39.500
and crossed the line, you could hate me too.

00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:43.400
But I want you to learn about this job from dad very soon.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.600
If I couldn't be working here,

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.600
you would be the one to help him with everything.

00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.200
You know that?

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.200
You should be the one taking care of the business.

00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.400
You can do anything.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:05.200
You're a kind-hearted person. The workers love you. You're so perfect.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Nobody is perfect.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.000
I could have something bad hidden from everyone.

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.000
I don't like to see you like this.

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.000
You've always kept your feeling since you were young.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:28.400
Can I make you feel better?

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.800
You can't help me with that.

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.600
What about this? Does it help?

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:01.400
I bought it for you.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:06.000
It will be a Chinese opera performance at the temple in a few days.

00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:07.600
I'll take you there.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.600
Good. Since the Japanese soldiers are here for war,

00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:14.600
we didn't have a lot of fun events.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.000
But dad didn't let you go outside, what should we do?

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:23.000
I'll take you to sneak out.

00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.000
We were just kids but I remembered our promises

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.000
that I'd take you to watch Chinese opera everywhere. 

00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:39.200
I'm done. Let's eat. 

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:40.200
Yes. 

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.800
Did Yang eat anything yesterday?

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.400
I saw he went to Bua's place.

00:16:30.401 --> 00:16:32.000
He could be fed already.

00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:42.000
Bua.

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.400
You're here? What's going on?

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
I'd like to talk about Yang.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.000
He asked you to talk to me?

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.200
He knows that I love you so he asked for your help.

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:01.000
It's not like that. He's never asked me.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:03.000
He couldn't asked you directly

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:06.000
but you felt bad for him.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.200
You're too nice to him.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.000
You spoiled him and he could get used to that.

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.600
I didn't spoil him.

00:17:14.601 --> 00:17:17.400
I just don't judge him like you do.

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:21.600
You judge me too. I scolded him like that

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.400
because I didn't want him to go outside.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.000
There are Japanese soldiers everywhere, it's dangerous.

00:17:27.001 --> 00:17:28.800
It's not like I hate him or anything.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:33.000
You love him. Why didn't you talk to him nicely?

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:36.000
If it was Tian who came home late last night,

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.400
would you talk to him harshly like you did to Yang?

00:17:40.401 --> 00:17:43.600
Yan has been mischievous like this for so many times.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.000
I can't talk to him nicely, I don't want to encourage him.

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.000
Mischievous? Or you just don't like the way he talks?

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:02.000
You're lucky

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:05.000
that Tian and Yang love each other.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.000
Otherwise, they would think that you love one more than another. 

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:16.000
You're telling me off like this?

00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.700
What's bothering you?

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
It's about Tian.

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:40.400
My husband loves and adores him

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.200
but I'm still worried.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:48.200
You shouldn't be worried. Tian is undefeated

00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:51.400
because Yang is mischievous and he gets into a fight all the time.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.500
That's what I'm worried.

00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:59.000
If Tian starts to be a mischief and getting into a fight like Yang,

00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.600
I could teach him to behave himself so he could change.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:07.200
But I can't change who he actually is.

00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:11.400
No matter how much Yang makes my husband upset

00:19:11.401 --> 00:19:16.000
or furious about him, he's still superior to Tian.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.000
Because Yang is a real man.

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.200
Madame!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I don't know if it's my own karma or Zhang's curse

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.000
that Tian has been this way.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.400
He will be destroying himself

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.000
if my husband or anyone know about this.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.000
How could anyone know about this?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:45.000
There are only me, you and Tian who know about this.

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:48.800
The secret will continue to be a secret. 

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.000
You're good at this.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:20.000
Can you help me?

00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:23.400
No one is better at this than Dong. 

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:40.600
You brought me this western perfume?

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.500
It smells nice and it suits someone pretty like you.

00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.700
Thank you so much.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.500
You want to watch Chinese opera with me?

00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:59.000
I'm not free.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.200
I haven't told you when and you're not free already?

00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:08.000
I'm not free because I don't like.

00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:11.000
You're asking for it? Come on.

00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.000
If you don't like the performance, then what do you like?

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.400
It's not that she doesn't like the performance, she doesn't like you.

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.200
You shut up!

00:21:20.201 --> 00:21:23.600
That's right. You should stop dreaming about her already.

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:26.200
Mud is ambitious.

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.600
I'm the worker's leader and I'm not good enough for her,

00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.200
then who is?

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400
What is it?

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.000
I saw that you're still up.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
I thought that you might be working so I brought you tea.

00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:03.600
Thank you.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.400
You're welcome.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:12.400
My bangle dropped. I'm sorry. 

00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:45.000
Tian?

00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.000
What're you doing? 

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.500
I dropped my bangle.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.200
You scum! You think I don't know your trick?

00:22:59.700 --> 00:23:02.200
You're from a lower class and you reach up to someone higher than you.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:05.000
You should look at yourself.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.600
I think I should tell Madame to fire you.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.300
What's going on? / Madame.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000
I brought Tian some tea and I dropped my bangle.

00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:21.000
Aunt Jia saw me and she misunderstood me.

00:23:21.001 --> 00:23:22.400
I didn't misunderstand her.

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:25.400
I could tell that you tried to seduce Tian in just a glance.

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:39.400
You should stay here and take care of Tian.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Mom!

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.300
You can take care of him until the next morning.

00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.000
Let's go. 

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.200
Madame!

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
You know that Mud is seducing Tian,

00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:19.400
instead of stopping her, why did you let her do that?

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:24.800
It'd be better if she can make Tian become her boyfriend tonight.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.600
Mud is a servant and she's too ambitious.

00:24:28.601 --> 00:24:31.600
If Tian falls for her, she could be arrogant and that'd be worse. 

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.000
I don't care about that.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:38.200
I just want Tian to change his mind and become a real man

00:24:38.201 --> 00:24:40.300
before everything is too late.

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.000
You can leave, don't mind my mom.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.000
I can't.

00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:57.000
I need to follow her order, strictly.

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.000
I'll take care of you until the next morning.

00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:07.600
Tian?

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.200
Mud! 

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:25.500
Why's that? Because I'm just a servant?

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.500
You're a woman. You should respect yourself and have dignity.

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:35.000
Don't lower your standard like this.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:40.400
One more thing, I don't care about your status, whether you're an aristocrat or a servant,

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.000
I won't take advantage of you.

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.000
Oh my!

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.000
Please take advantage of me. I wouldn't mind.

00:25:51.001 --> 00:25:51.501
Mud! 

00:25:52.500 --> 00:25:55.800
Tian! 

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.800
Why is it so hard to seduce him? I almost got him.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:13.200
Mom? Why did you tell Mud do this to me?

00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:19.200
You're a young man. People at your age want a woman, don't you?

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.400
You know that I don't like it.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:26.800
I can't find the type that you like for you.

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:32.800
Mom? 

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:39.000
You've forced me since I was young,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.600
You told me to do this and not to do that.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.000
I've always listened to you.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.200
Because I hope that one day you'll accept me.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.600
But I can never satisfy you. 

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.000
You are trying to change me to be who you want me to be. 

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.200
I've done everything so that you'll be the most suitable one

00:27:01.201 --> 00:27:03.200
for the leader position of this family.

00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:05.000
Mom?

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:10.000
If being me like this can't succeed the family, then I don’t want this.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.400
That's enough. Go to bed and forget about these nonsense things you said. 

00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:17.500
You only care about what you want.

00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.000
You never care about me. 

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.200
You don't think I care?

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:26.000
You want Yang to succeed everything

00:27:26.001 --> 00:27:27.600
instead of you?

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
I did what I did because I love you.

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:34.000
You don't love me, you only love yourself. 

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.000
You're worried that you would lose your power

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.600
lose your powerful position in the family because you have a son like me. 

00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:42.300
Ouch!

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.400
Please stop.

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:47.400
Tian.

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.000
Don't tell me that I don't love you.

00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:56.600
You think I did all of this because I'm selfish?

00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.800
Think about it.

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.600
How're you gonna live your life after this?

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.600
Mom?

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:15.400
I just want to live a happy life. 

00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:24.600
You won't be happy as long as you continue to be like this.

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.000
We got the tea! 

00:28:56.001 --> 00:28:59.800
What's the tea? You didn't say anything earlier

00:28:59.801 --> 00:29:04.200
We've been watching them for 10 years and there's no progress.

00:29:04.201 --> 00:29:06.000
You've been watching them for 10 years

00:29:06.001 --> 00:29:08.000
and have you ever seen Li slapped her son?

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:14.000
I think what made her slap her beloved son like that

00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:18.400
must be related to the thing they burned for sure.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:20.000
But what is it?

00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.000
Maybe it's not something serious.

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:27.400
You slap Yang all the time.

00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:30.000
Hey! / Ouch! 

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.000
We're different.

00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.000
Didn't you hear Tian say that

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:39.500
his mom would lose her power for having a son like him?

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:44.800
Or Tian isn't her son?

00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.000
When he isn't her real son,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:50.000
she could lose her power. 

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.400
You heard people talking about other houses, didn't you? / Oops. 

00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:55.600
That's so off the topic. 

00:29:57.400 --> 00:30:00.000
I think what they're hiding must be big.

00:30:00.001 --> 00:30:02.400
Big enough to kick her out of her current position. 

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.400
I need to know what it is. 

00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:20.400
You told me that you wanted to talk to me. What is it?

00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:22.800
About Tian.

00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:28.600
He's old enough to succeed everything in the family

00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:33.200
and you're working hard. You should rest already.

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.400
Well, well

00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:48.400
you're rushing him to hand over his position to Tian like this,

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.800
don't you think it's another way of rushing him to death?

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.800
Who did that? I didn't say a word about dying. 

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:01.500
You don't have to. You want Tian to succeed Mr.Song,

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
because you're afraid of something?

00:31:04.001 --> 00:31:07.400
I'm not afraid, I'm just…
That's enough. Stop.

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.400
I've been thinking about this too.

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.400
I want to rest already.

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:20.000
I went to see when the good time is and it's only 6 months.

00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:25.400
But according to the custom,

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:29.000
Tian needs to get married and has children to continue the family

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.800
so I can trust that the business and Five Dragons Association

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.400
would have a successor for sure.

00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:41.400
You can trust me about that. I'll find the most suitable person for Tian.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:52.000
Madame rushed Mr.Song to hand over his work to Tian already. 

00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.500
She must be worried that what she was hiding could be unearthed. 

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.800
She's so smart. 

00:31:56.801 --> 00:31:59.500
No wonder why she can keep a secret for 10 years. 

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.200
You want to work for her?

00:32:02.201 --> 00:32:06.000
She's too smart, she wouldn't want me to work for her.

00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:07.400
Ouch!

00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:09.400
You're picking at me many times already.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:11.200
I'm sorry.

00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:15.400
I can't wait any longer.

00:32:15.401 --> 00:32:18.400
I need to know the truth before Tian is succeeded. 

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:21.600
Otherwise, there's no more hope left for me.

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.800
It'll be a performance at the temple today.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.000
Yang? 

00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.400
What're you doing? Why didn't you use the door properly?

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:54.600
Why didn't you get dressed?

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.800
Get dressed? To where?

00:32:56.801 --> 00:32:58.000
To watch the Chinese opera performance.

00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.200
But dad told us not to go outside.

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.800
I remembered that he forbid us

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.400
so I climbed up here to sneak you out.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.600
What if he knew that we went outside? It'd be so bad.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.600
But I promised you to take you to watch it,

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.000
you want me to break my own promise?

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.200
Whoa!

00:33:34.700 --> 00:33:39.200
Save me a seat. I'll get some snacks and I'll follow you.

00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:40.400
Hurry up.

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.600
Thank you.

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.000
Why do you have to cover it up like that?

00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:05.000
This piece came from Chinese dynasty. 

00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:10.000
It's not just valued in price but it's a sentimental piece.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.000
My family's memories are in here

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.200
It's 100

00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:22.600
100? It's not even enough to buy gold.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.600
Take a look closely and carefully.

00:35:27.400 --> 00:35:29.800
It comes from China.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:36.800
I don't want to sell it. It's so valuable.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.200
If it's that valuable to you, then you should keep it.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.400
What should we do?

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Plan B.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:36:01.200
Please help me.

00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:05.600
My family is in a big trouble. 

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:10.200
Some days, I don't have anything to eat.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:13.600
Please help me.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.800
I'm so thirsty. I need water. 

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.800
Go buy him a drink. Come on.
Sure.

00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:33.000
Please wait a minute, she'll get you something to drink. / Sure.

00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:38.000
Actually, there's another way to earn money.

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.000
Be my wife.

00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:42.000
Hey! 

00:36:43.600 --> 00:36:47.000
Well, you need money? You can be my wife. 

00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:49.000
Come on.

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:51.200
Don't get any closer.

00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.000
Come to me, ouch!

00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.400
Don't!

00:36:57.800 --> 00:36:59.000
Don't run away from me.

00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.400
Ouch! / Argh! 

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:12.000
I'll get you a new one.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:57.700
Thank you.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:57.400
Noi! Run! 

00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.000
Where to? / Ouch!

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Move! 

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
I'm sorry but please move.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.000
Where should we go?

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.600
Noi! 

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.200
Stop! 

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:55.800
Did you see two women running here?

00:40:55.801 --> 00:40:58.800
She hit my head and ran away. 

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:03.000
I see.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.000
Women? 

00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.000
That's right. 

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:13.000
What did they do to you?

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.000
Why are you bleeding like that?

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:19.500
I…I didn't do anything. 

00:41:19.501 --> 00:41:21.400
They had something to sell.

00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:24.600
I offered her unmatched price so she was furious at me.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.300
Damn it! The fallen noble woman like her! 

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
What about this? You should call the police.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.000
If she did something wrong, you should go to the police.

00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:42.500
Nope. I feel bad for her.

00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:46.400
Is she hiding in a jar?

00:41:46.401 --> 00:41:50.200
What type of person would be hiding in a jar?

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.600
A woman? With long hair? / That's right.

00:41:52.601 --> 00:41:54.400
I saw her running over there.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:55.400
Over there?

00:41:55.401 --> 00:41:57.000
That's right. You should follow her there.

00:41:57.001 --> 00:41:58.200
Sure. Thanks.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Is he gone?

00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.000
What? I didn't quite hear you?

00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.000
Is he gone?

00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:11.000
Oh? That man?

00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.000
Yep? / Is he gone?

00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.300
Right? He's gone.

00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:19.400
Then you should get up already.

00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.400
Wait!

00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.200
Hey!

00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:28.300
Get up, now!

00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.000
Smells so bad. 

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.800
There're trashes in here.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.400
Let me ask you something, are you really a noble woman?

00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.000
Why?

00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:04.000
I've never seen a noble woman like you before. 

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.400
You can't possibly think that just because you helped me, you could say anything to me.

00:43:08.200 --> 00:43:10.800
You should see when I'm fully dressed. You'll be stunned.

00:43:14.500 --> 00:43:17.200
Thanks for helping me.

00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:35.600
I was born a Chinese, when I die, I want to be a Chinese ghost too.

00:43:35.601 --> 00:43:39.400
I'm ready to fight until my last blood to save my country.
Yang!

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:48.600
I saw something really funny, I'll tell you later.
I don't care if I die.

00:43:48.601 --> 00:43:49.700
That's well said.

00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.800
I agreed.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:04.000
My name is Hua Mulan,

00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:14.200
and I've never betrayed my country.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:22.700
My determination is strong like a sun shining every day.
What did they say? What's the play?

00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.200
Mulanchi

00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.200
Mulanchi?

00:44:27.001 --> 00:44:35.600
After this meal, us, Chinese soldiers

00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:44.200
are ready to fight with Japanese soldiers so we'll know the result.

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.800
Are you scared?

00:44:45.801 --> 00:44:47.000
Are you afraid of death?

00:44:47.001 --> 00:44:49.300
Nope!
Let's go home / Hey!

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:51.000
We'll fight until we die
What is it?

00:44:51.001 --> 00:44:53.400
This is an adaptation to protest Japanese soldiers. / What?
Fight til we die!

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.300
Let's go. 

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:08.000
Come on

00:45:08.001 --> 00:45:09.000
Mom? / Get out of the way.

00:45:09.001 --> 00:45:12.000
Come on, hide! 

00:45:12.001 --> 00:45:15.000
You can go ahead, I'll follow you.

00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.200
Let's go. 

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.200
Mom? / Yang?

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:20.200
Yang? 

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:27.200
Get up, kid! Come on. Are you okay?

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.400
Let's find a place to hide.

00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:38.000
Hey!

00:45:45.700 --> 00:45:46.200
You!

00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:51.200
Let's go. 

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.000
Run! / Yang?

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.200
Thank you.

00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:13.400
You're injured?

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.000
Press it.

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.000
Tian! / Yang!

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.000
Come here.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.000
How much money have you got? I need to pay debt.

00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:08.200
There's an accident.

00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.600
The china was broken.

00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:25.400
It'd be better if you were born as a man, so you could be a government officer,

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.000
or you could get more job options than this.

00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:34.000
Don't worry.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.200
Even though I'm a woman, I'll try to keep our palace

00:48:38.201 --> 00:48:40.000
so it won't be seized. 

00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:44.800
Stop thinking about it. Let it be my job.

00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.500
You would? / Yes.

00:48:50.200 --> 00:48:55.400
You're so strong as one of noble family members.

00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:03.800
Come on.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:07.800
Come here.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Slower.

00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:15.200
Let's go. 

00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.000
How're you gonna go up there?

00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:27.000
You can step here and I'll push you up.

00:49:27.001 --> 00:49:29.000
Come on, we have no time to think.

00:49:29.100 --> 00:49:31.000
I'm gonna count to three.

00:49:31.001 --> 00:49:32.700
1..2..3…

00:49:32.701 --> 00:49:34.300
You're back? / Oops.

00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:35.500
Bua?

00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:40.400
I brought you something.

00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:46.400
Your dad waited to see both of you in the hallway.

00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:00.500
Yang and Tian are here.

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:10.600
Someone saw both of you went out to watch the show, so they told me.

00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.000
Tian.

00:50:17.800 --> 00:50:20.400
Is that blood? Are you okay?

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.200
I'm okay.

00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:25.400
It's the blood from someone who saved me. It's not mine.

00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.000
Good thing that it's somebody else's blood.

00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:31.600
If you keep on sneaking out like this,

00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:34.200
you will be the one bleeding for sure.

00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:37.800
I told you that during war time,

00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.000
don't just wander off like that.

00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:44.000
What if they were shooting? Aren't you scared?

00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.200
I…/ I'm sorry. 

00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.000
I wanted to watch the show so I sneaked out.

00:50:52.600 --> 00:50:56.000
Because of you? You took Tian out?

00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.400
You watched a show about rebelling Japanese soldiers.

00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.400
What if they arrested you? What would you do?

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:03.600
You'll ruin our family.

00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:05.800
You want to die?

00:51:05.801 --> 00:51:07.000
It's not like that. 

00:51:07.001 --> 00:51:08.300
You need to calm down.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.800
You can't blame it all on Yang.

00:51:11.801 --> 00:51:15.000
Tian was there too. Tian was there,too.
Tian has nothing to do with this.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:16.500
Yang! 

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.000
I sneaked out. Tian knew about this so he came to get me.

00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.500
He was worried that I'd be punished.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.600
I warned you once and it didn't work.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:31.800
I thought I should punish you harder so you would remember.

00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:34.000
On your knees.

00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.700
Sir? / Sir?

00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:41.200
Yang!

00:51:44.700 --> 00:51:45.200
Yang!

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:53.200
Tian! 

00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:59.000
If you're gonna punish him, then you need to punish me too.

00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:01.000
What're you doing? Get up, now.

00:52:01.001 --> 00:52:03.400
Get up, now. 

00:52:03.401 --> 00:52:05.000
Get up. / Get up.

00:52:05.001 --> 00:52:07.000
Get up, come here / Yang!

00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:08.200
Yang! 

00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:12.000
You can't punish only Yang.

00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:15.400
It's not fair. You have to punish Tian too.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
It's my fault. I need to be punished. 

00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.000
You're right. I shouldn't disobey you. 

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.300
There are lots of people died at the opera house. 

00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:33.300
If I was shot or arrested,

00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.300
everyone here would be in trouble too.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:38.300
Please punish me. 

00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:39.200
Yang!

00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:43.400
Yang! / Sir?

00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.000
Sir? / Yang!

00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:46.200
Dad! 

00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.500
Don't do that. / Dad! 

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:50.000
Don't! / Stop! 

00:52:50.001 --> 00:52:51.300
Don't hurt him.

00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:54.300
Sir? / Please don't hurt him.

00:52:54.700 --> 00:52:56.000
That's enough

00:52:56.001 --> 00:52:57.000
Please don't hurt him.

00:52:57.001 --> 00:53:01.000
Don't hurt him.

00:53:01.001 --> 00:53:03.000
That's enough / Please don't hurt him.

00:53:03.200 --> 00:53:05.200
That's enough.

00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:08.300
Stop! 

00:53:08.700 --> 00:53:10.000
Don't hurt him / Tian?

00:53:10.001 --> 00:53:11.400
Get him upstairs. 

00:53:11.401 --> 00:53:13.300
Don't hurt him.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.300
Don't hurt him.

00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:19.000
That's enough.

00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:22.000
Please don't hurt him.
Please stop.

00:53:22.001 --> 00:53:25.000
Sir? / He didn't listen to me.

00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:27.000
That's enough.

00:53:27.001 --> 00:53:28.500
It's enough / That's enough.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.000
It's enough / That's enough.

00:53:31.001 --> 00:53:32.000
That's enough.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:34.000
Yang is here safe and sound.

00:53:34.200 --> 00:53:37.000
He should learn his lesson by now.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:45.300
If you didn't learn your lesson, you'd die because of those Japanese soldiers.

00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:56.400
Sir?

00:53:56.401 --> 00:53:57.800
You're such..! 

00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.800
Let me go.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.800
I told you to let me go! 

00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:14.000
Let me go. / Ouch!

00:54:14.001 --> 00:54:15.200
Stop right now!

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.500
You want your dad to know that you were the one who wanted to watch the show, not Yang?

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.000
You knew that I was the one wanted to go.

00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.200
Why didn't you tell dad

00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.000
that I made a mistake?

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:40.400
Or you're worried that he would be mad?

00:54:40.401 --> 00:54:42.200
And he wouldn't hand over his work to me?

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
And you wouldn't be a female leader of this house anymore.

00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.200
That's right. I'm worried that I would lose my power.

00:54:49.201 --> 00:54:52.000
I don't care about you. I don't love you at all.

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:54.200
If you had been shot by Japanese soldiers,

00:54:54.201 --> 00:54:57.000
I would have lost my position as the head of the house as well.

00:54:57.800 --> 00:55:01.600
If I was shot to death, it would be better, right?

00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:03.400
Better than letting someone know who I am. 

00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:08.000
Please don't be sarcastic to one another like that.

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:16.000
No matter how hard you tried to accuse me of being selfish,

00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.000
I'll try to hide everyone about who you are.

00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:11.400
Please be gentle, it hurts. 

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.400
I'd like to slap more of you. Why would you protect him like that?

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.400
You should have used this chance for your dad to scold him.

00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:22.000
So your dad would take him down from being the first successor.

00:56:22.001 --> 00:56:23.300
And you can be the first one instead.

00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.800
Be gentle. 

00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:28.800
It's not that easy.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.800
When you two went out together,

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.800
you should have sent him to Japanese soldiers so they would have ended him. 

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:39.200
Can you stop pushing me to be a bad guy?

00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:43.000
I've heard you told me this since I was young.

00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.000
I told you already

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:48.000
I won't fight with Tian for any position, no matter what.

00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:51.400
You can call me mean or whatever.

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:54.400
But I did all of these for you

00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:58.800
A mother wants the best for her son and I…

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.600
I…I don't want

00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:05.800
to see you being pushed to the ground like I did my whole life. 

00:57:07.600 --> 00:57:08.600
Listen to me. 

00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:13.000
If we're in our place, Madame won't mess with us.

00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:14.800
No, you listen to me.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:18.000
You're one of your dad's sons.

00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.200
You have a right to own everything that belongs to you

00:57:21.201 --> 00:57:22.800
as much as Tian.

00:57:22.801 --> 00:57:25.200
But everything belongs to Tian since the beginning. 

00:57:25.201 --> 00:57:29.200
How did you know? If Tian really is the most suitable one,

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.600
then what is his secret that his mom tried to hide? What is that?

00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:38.000
You should leave him alone. 

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:44.000
Yang!

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
What if something that they hide

00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:53.500
is really bad and it could ruin our family?

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
What'd you do?

00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.000
I'll stand by Tian.

00:58:02.700 --> 00:58:07.000
I'll support Tian and encourage him to solve the family's problem.

00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:09.200
Ouch! 

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:33.400
Am I too selfish?

00:58:33.600 --> 00:58:35.600
Am I the bad mother?

00:58:35.601 --> 00:58:36.600
Madame. 

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.800
No matter what I do, Tian will be disagreeing with me.

00:58:39.801 --> 00:58:42.400
He thinks that I did all of these for myself. 

00:58:42.401 --> 00:58:46.000
When I did all of these for him. 

00:58:46.200 --> 00:58:51.400
Tian hasn’t been old enough to know the world like you did. 

00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.600
He will understand that you did all of these

00:58:55.800 --> 00:58:58.000
because you love and care for him.

00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:39.400
Tian? Madame wanted to see you.

00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:53.400
Tian's here.

00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:59.800
This is Pat. 

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.000
Hello.

01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.000
Hello.

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:06.600
And that's Pin. 

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.000
Hello, Tian.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Hello.

01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:23.200
Do you remember her?

01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.800
She used to play at our house.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.200
I didn't. 

01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:38.000
Well, I didn't quite remember about it either.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:45.000
That's true. Well, you will start to remember something when you two start chatting.

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:50.400
Pin just came back from oversea. 

01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:54.600
She must have a lot of fun stories to tell you.

01:00:58.200 --> 01:01:01.400
Why don't you take her to the garden?

01:01:01.401 --> 01:01:03.000
The adults will discuss something here.

01:01:06.200 --> 01:01:07.400
Sure.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
My tummy hurts.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:21.700
Are you okay?

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:23.000
I need to use the bathroom.

01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:24.200
You should go.

01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.400
The weather is nice today.

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:34.900
Yeah.

01:01:37.400 --> 01:01:39.800
Your garden is pretty. 

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.800
Yeah.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:58.000
I think we should sit down.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:00.200
Okay.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Ouch!

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.200
You! 

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
You know her?

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:33.400
That night…

01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:38.200
No, I didn't. Maybe he is mistaking me with someone.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:44.600
Tian. 

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:48.000
There's a problem about accounting at the warehouse, can you please check?

01:02:48.800 --> 01:02:50.000
Sure, I'll follow you.

01:02:54.200 --> 01:02:57.400
Can you chat with her? I need to go see something.

01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.000
Tian!

01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:11.800
We've never met?

01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:13.200
Nope. 

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:16.200
But I think we have.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000
You must be mistaking me with someone. It was dark at the temple.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.400
And it was late. Your eyes couldn't be worked properly.

01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:25.200
Excuse me.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.000
Did I tell you that we met at the temple?

01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:34.800
Did I tell you that we met at night?

01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:41.000
I was just guessing. I'm good at guessing. 

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.200
And many people said that 

01:03:44.201 --> 01:03:46.400
they saw someone who looked like me at the temple all the time.

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:54.000
But I'm sure that I saw you. I wasn't wrong about this. 

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.200
You wanted it to be me?

01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:04.800
Supposed that I was there

01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.000
then it was just a little misunderstanding.

01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.000
A gentleman like you

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:14.000
won't talk about the lady behind her back, right?

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.000
I need to think about it.

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.400
Because the woman that I met that night wasn't exactly a lady.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:22.600
She was more like an untamed mare. 

01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:29.000
I could forget what happened that night if I was in a good mood.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.200
But don't make me mad,

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:37.400
or I could say something.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:57.600
How's today? Isn't Pin cute or what?

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:04.200
Please don't do this. I feel awkward.

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.400
You seem to be awkward and uncomfortable in everything I wanted you to do.

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:10.800
You know what it is.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:13.800
Please don't force me.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.400
I just wanted you two to know each other. Why do you have to go against me on this?

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:24.600
Pin is a good girl and she's cute. You should get to know her and everything will be better.

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:35.400
Madame is a witch.

01:05:35.600 --> 01:05:38.500
When Mr.Song said that her son needs to get married before become a successor.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:42.200
She's eager to find a woman for her son.

01:05:42.201 --> 01:05:45.000
If I was her, I would be in a hurry as well.

01:05:46.200 --> 01:05:49.000
She invited Pin, a daughter of Pat here.

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:52.800
I heard that they have nothing left but their family name.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.200
Otherwise, he wouldn't put his palace in mortgage with Madame. 

01:05:57.800 --> 01:06:00.000
He would give her daughter as a way to pay for interest. 

01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:03.400
Just like when your dad gave you to Mr.Song,

01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:05.000
to pay debt.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:08.000
I would have slapped their mouth if you were someone else.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:11.300
But you said it so I would kick you instead.

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:13.500
I'm sorry. 

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.400
Song Family is wealthy.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.600
But the family name is not that noble.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.000
She prefers Pin because of this.

01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.000
That's right, they only got their noble name

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.800
if Tian got married with Pin,

01:06:32.801 --> 01:06:36.000
they would be a perfect couple.

01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:39.200
You're right about this.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:44.500
But I need to get in their way.

01:06:47.200 --> 01:06:50.200
You want to mess with their wedding, and you want to know about the secret.

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.600
Will you be success in any of this?

01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:06.400
Are you sneaking into Tian's bedroom?

01:07:06.401 --> 01:07:08.400
Aren't you afraid that you would get caught?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.800
Nope. Because you're one to get inside, not me.

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.800
Go inside and search. So we'd know what they're hiding. 

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:25.000
My tummy hurts, I need to use the bathroom.

01:07:25.001 --> 01:07:25.501
Wait!

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:03.500
What the hell is he hiding?

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:43.800
What the hell?

01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:48.000
He's preparing this for Pin?

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.800
Please holy spirit, help me.

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000
If Tian was hiding something, please let me find it. 

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:15.400
Tian!

01:09:17.200 --> 01:09:20.200
Where're you going? Stop, now. 

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.400
Tian! 

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:27.400
I told you to stop by to see Pin at her house, why didn't you?

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:31.400
I don't want to. 

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.000
You have to go, even if you didn't want to.

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:35.200
You met her once.

01:09:35.201 --> 01:09:37.000
Don't be too quick to judge her.

01:09:37.001 --> 01:09:40.800
I didn't judge her. I don't care if she's a nice girl,

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:43.000
she's not the right one for me.

01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:47.000
I chose her for you, of course she's the right one.

01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.700
You should come to say hi to her so she'd be happy.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.400
Bring her something. I prepared it for you.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.800
You're pushing me too much.

01:09:55.801 --> 01:09:59.000
If I didn't push you, someone would know about you already. 

01:10:00.700 --> 01:10:04.000
Maybe I want people to know about me.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:42.400
What's going on?

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
We find the right time for you.

01:11:22.001 --> 01:11:23.000
The right time to get married.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.800
The family's pin. 

01:11:24.801 --> 01:11:26.400
Please, don't

01:11:26.401 --> 01:11:29.000
I'll do anything for my son. 

01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:33.400
If you want to be a successor,

01:11:33.401 --> 01:11:36.600
you need to get married and have children. 

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.200
A gay like me could have children,

01:11:41.201 --> 01:11:43.200
but I don't want to.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:45.000
Who's that?
