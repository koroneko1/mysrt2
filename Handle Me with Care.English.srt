00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,625
At 8 p.m. last Tuesday,

3
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,166
Pol. Sub-Lt. Chidchob Kobkarnklai

4
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,583
led his men

5
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:39,166
to raid a house on Sukhumvit 38,

6
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,333
which was owned by Boonchu Kiatkrai.

7
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:45,500
After searching the premises,

8
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,750
the police found

9
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,916
a stash of illegal Buddha heads

10
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
and other religious artifacts
hidden inside the house.

11
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:55,208
The housekeeper, Somjai Niantae,

12
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:56,875
stated during the interrogation

13
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,750
that the tenant,

14
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,416
Mr. Samuel Victor,
a 54-year-old American expat,

15
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,458
has an extensive criminal record

16
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,333
in trading illegal antiques around Asia.

17
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:11,125
Police are still looking

18
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,333
for Mr. Victor,

19
00:03:13,416 --> 00:03:15,750
who has fled the scene

20
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:18,875
and is believed

21
00:03:18,958 --> 00:03:20,375
to be hiding

22
00:03:20,458 --> 00:03:21,666
somewhere

23
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,500
in northeastern Thailand.

24
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,750
14 HOURS AGO

25
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:12,958
Three are actually more useful than two.

26
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:14,375
Yes.

27
00:04:16,166 --> 00:04:17,750
That's a lot of stuff.

28
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,458
What are you celebrating today?

29
00:04:21,041 --> 00:04:21,916
Yes.

30
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:48,666
Hello, Kwan.

31
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,791
Will you go to Lin's engagement party?

32
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,375
No. My car broke down.

33
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:56,750
You can ride with me.

34
00:05:57,708 --> 00:06:00,708
It will be a big party.
You should show your support.

35
00:06:01,916 --> 00:06:04,000
You're dating Ann.
Bring her along and show her off.

36
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,041
No way.

37
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:11,791
So the rumor that she dumped you is true.

38
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,291
Where did you get that?
I was the one who dumped her.

39
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:19,291
Look who's talking.

40
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,916
If a girl like Ann dumps you,
you're beyond help.

41
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,333
You'll have to find somebody
who has too much of something, like you.

42
00:06:25,833 --> 00:06:26,833
Asshole.

43
00:06:40,083 --> 00:06:45,625
A CHILD WITH THREE ARMS WAS FOUND,
VILLAGERS ARE WORSHIPING HIM

44
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,666
Everybody has something
they don't want to see in the mirror.

45
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,458
For some people,

46
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,541
a tiny pimple

47
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,750
can look like a huge stone.

48
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:21,833
Crow's feet, too.

49
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:24,625
Or baldness.

50
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:26,750
Or a big belly.

51
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:32,750
I completely understand those people.

52
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:34,916
Sometimes,

53
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,083
they can look away
and pretend not to see their defects.

54
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:41,375
But those people can never understand me.

55
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,625
No matter how hard I try to ignore it,

56
00:07:47,458 --> 00:07:48,625
this extra arm

57
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,041
sticks out as if it's mocking me.

58
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,208
TAWEETANSAMAI

59
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,125
Lin has stolen my heart

60
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:25,375
since we were in high school.

61
00:08:40,208 --> 00:08:41,958
To tell you the truth,

62
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,083
I was quite popular back then.

63
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,833
I was the star
of the school's volleyball team.

64
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,791
My third arm came in handy

65
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,500
every time we wanted to fake a move.

66
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,291
THE TENTH PROVINCIAL
YOUTH VOLLEYBALL COMPETITION

67
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:07,083
Everybody wanted me to be on their team.

68
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,625
Lin was the star of her class.

69
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,916
Don't move.

70
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:22,333
Your arms are amazing.

71
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:28,666
However, my athletic life

72
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,416
existed only in the school's playground.

73
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,125
When it came to real matches

74
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,583
against other schools,

75
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,666
I couldn't participate.

76
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,750
They said I was breaking the rules.

77
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:40,416
My arm was an unfair advantage.

78
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,958
Where is it?

79
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,125
How did you know?

80
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:48,750
Let's go again.

81
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,250
One, two...

82
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,333
Whenever I'm with you,

83
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,416
I never know which hand to hold.

84
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:58,666
Does it matter?

85
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,750
It's still one of my arms.

86
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,750
It's hard for me

87
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,958
when everybody stares at your arms.

88
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:08,500
I used to think that

89
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:11,208
I'd get used to it one day.

90
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,916
But it's just impossible.

91
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:17,166
Do you think my arm is disgusting?

92
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,583
No.

93
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,333
I mean, we were younger back then.

94
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,500
Don't think too much.

95
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,541
Just tell me

96
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,791
who this guy is.

97
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,208
Don't be mad at him.

98
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:37,125
I just get along better with him.

99
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:41,416
Who else

100
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,916
can satisfy you

101
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,750
the same way my arms can?

102
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,375
But he has a device from Italy.

103
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,041
A DEVICE?

104
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,166
FROM ITALY?

105
00:11:28,291 --> 00:11:30,333
My job isn't exactly cool.

106
00:11:33,375 --> 00:11:34,625
Who wouldn't want to be cool?

107
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,541
Ann, take this to the supervisor.

108
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,958
I don't have any talents.

109
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,125
I'm just an ordinary guy with three arms.

110
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:03,333
So I ended up sorting mail
at the post office.

111
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:05,875
It's perfect.

112
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,541
I work in the back.
I don't need to see anybody.

113
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,291
These World Cup cards keep pouring in.

114
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,875
Yet, it's strange.

115
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:41,541
When the piles of mail

116
00:12:41,958 --> 00:12:43,541
in front of me get so big,

117
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,791
I can't help but feel

118
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:48,291
that having four arms
would be even better.

119
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:52,583
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH
TRAITHEP BOONSET

120
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,625
I GUESS EVERYBODY KNOWS

121
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,541
Today's my birthday.

122
00:13:08,166 --> 00:13:09,916
Here's your birthday present.

123
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:12,333
You bought this for my birthday?

124
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,916
I saw this on the street for just 59 baht.

125
00:13:15,791 --> 00:13:18,166
Are you putting a price on my goodwill?

126
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,166
It's not the price.

127
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,958
I'm upset because you didn't even try
to get me a decent gift.

128
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,291
Of course, I tried.

129
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:29,875
I bought it
because I think it fits your lifestyle.

130
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:30,875
My lifestyle?

131
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:32,500
A rubber lizard?

132
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,541
I know you're not in love with me.

133
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:38,375
You're with me
because you don't think I'm pretty,

134
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,041
because you don't think
I'll dump you, right?

135
00:13:41,958 --> 00:13:43,125
Who said that I don't love you?

136
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:45,375
I do love you, Ann.

137
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,000
Liar. You don't love me.

138
00:13:48,083 --> 00:13:52,250
You just couldn't bear to be alone
after Lin ditched you.

139
00:13:52,333 --> 00:13:55,541
Were you that desperate
to pick an ugly duckling like me?

140
00:13:58,833 --> 00:13:59,708
Ann.

141
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,541
You think my arm is disgusting, don't you?

142
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,000
Don't change the subject.

143
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:05,541
What I can't stand
is the fact that you don't love me.

144
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,083
Everyone warned me about it,
but I didn't believe them.

145
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,666
If you really love me, prove it.

146
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:14,125
-How?
-I don't know. Just prove it.

147
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:23,333
I knew it. Jerk! You're a freak.

148
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,041
You're a jerk with three arms.

149
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,041
Kwan.

150
00:14:28,125 --> 00:14:30,583
Yesterday, I dropped by Tawee's shop.

151
00:14:30,666 --> 00:14:34,166
He said your new shirt
for Lin's engagement party

152
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,708
is ready.

153
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,416
He asked you to come and pick it up.

154
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,416
Are you really going?

155
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,708
The whole town is speculating about it.

156
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,916
I don't think you should go.

157
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,541
I placed a bet.

158
00:14:48,625 --> 00:14:51,166
I bet you wouldn't dare show your face.

159
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,291
Mister. Why did you have to tell everyone?

160
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:55,000
I never said I would...

161
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,833
go.

162
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,250
Your shoulders...

163
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,666
Perfect.

164
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,291
Your arm.

165
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:12,125
One at a time.

166
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,500
Perfect.

167
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,250
Thank you, Tawee.

168
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,500
Remember,
a man must look for things that suit him.

169
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:25,541
Do you understand?

170
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,958
That's right. The clothes sold at shops

171
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,208
are for normal people.

172
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,125
But you,

173
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:35,291
you need something special.

174
00:15:35,458 --> 00:15:37,041
What does "special" mean?

175
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:38,666
It means you're special.

176
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,208
But what is "special"?

177
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,583
Something extraordinary.

178
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:44,041
Well...

179
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:49,083
It's like when you order
a special kind of pad thai.

180
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,875
I see.

181
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,416
Look.

182
00:15:53,041 --> 00:15:55,291
Your new shirt

183
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,291
is ready.

184
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:13,875
Luckily, you found him
before he got bloated.

185
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,458
Tough luck, Kwan.
No more new shirts for you!

186
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,250
NO MORE NEW SHIRTS

187
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,041
I'm screwed.

188
00:16:43,708 --> 00:16:46,416
Kwan, didn't you go
to Tawee's funeral yesterday?

189
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,500
I didn't have any shirts to wear.

190
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,083
That boy has a sense of humor.

191
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,083
TELEPHONE

192
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,375
Is this Dr. Somboon?

193
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:15,583
I'm Kwan.

194
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:17,916
Do you remember me?

195
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:22,166
You don't?

196
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:25,291
I...

197
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,458
I was on Life Finds The Way two years ago.

198
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:31,375
I'm the guy...

199
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,541
with three arms.

200
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:36,958
A few years back,

201
00:17:37,083 --> 00:17:38,458
-this stupid TV show
-You remember now?

202
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,041
aired my story.

203
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:45,375
They turned me into a pathetic loser
who was living in total misery.

204
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:48,166
At first glance,

205
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,625
you'd think this boy's life

206
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,291
is no different from anyone else's.

207
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,333
But if you look closely,

208
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,583
you'll see something sticking out.

209
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,833
His extra left arm.

210
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:02,958
This is Traithep or Kwan,

211
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,083
a boy with three arms.

212
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,125
LIFE FINDS THE WAY

213
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:10,666
THREE-ARMED BOY

214
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:13,250
Here we are in the province of Lampang.

215
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,750
The extra limb we'd never see
on a normal human being

216
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:20,666
has made his life totally miserable.

217
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:25,375
He lives in a small house
by the railroad track,

218
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:28,791
where there used to be
a pad thai restaurant.

219
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,458
When his mother died,

220
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,208
Kwan didn't keep the business running.

221
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:44,458
His dream is to be able to wear

222
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,541
two-sleeved shirts like everyone else.

223
00:18:59,375 --> 00:19:00,458
However,

224
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,291
Kwan's life will have to go on.

225
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:07,833
Because it's his life.

226
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:09,458
And because

227
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,416
life finds the way.

228
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,458
As soon as the show went on air,

229
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:17,791
this damn doctor called me.

230
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,083
This arm has blood vessels

231
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:24,125
directly connected to the heart.

232
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,875
To remove it, it will require

233
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,958
a risky

234
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,750
and expensive operation.

235
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,625
He'll need expert care.

236
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,750
Our center

237
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:39,083
is willing to perform the amputation

238
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,458
free of charge.

239
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,625
Chop your own balls off first!

240
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,583
Yes, I'll have the operation.

241
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,708
How soon can you do it?

242
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,375
It's too bad

243
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,041
you're leaving so suddenly.

244
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,041
I don't want you to quit.

245
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:59,458
World Cup cards are all over the place.

246
00:20:05,541 --> 00:20:06,666
All right.

247
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,541
I wish you luck.

248
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,208
By the way,

249
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,250
can you recommend someone
who has your qualifications?

250
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,375
Hey.

251
00:20:29,875 --> 00:20:31,958
HANDLE WITH CARE

252
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,875
-I already gave you a discount.
-Make it 40, please.

253
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:34,708
NIYOM PAD THAI ON CHAN ROAD

254
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,583
Damn it.

255
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,416
It broke down again.

256
00:22:17,583 --> 00:22:18,833
Twenty thousand?

257
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,333
Your car is too old.

258
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,625
Even if I fix it,
it will just break down again.

259
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:29,000
I'll only make money by selling its parts.

260
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,458
But this was my mother's car.

261
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:39,583
Fine.

262
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:40,791
Twenty thousand, it is.

263
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:42,916
I'll go get the money.

264
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,083
Here.

265
00:22:59,791 --> 00:23:01,333
Why are you in such a hurry?

266
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:04,458
Are you sure you're not
rushing into the arm thing?

267
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:07,541
I have no choice.

268
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,166
Tawee is dead.

269
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,666
I don't have shirts to wear.

270
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:13,291
What a stupid excuse.

271
00:23:14,166 --> 00:23:16,583
Anyway, is the rumor true?

272
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:17,791
That Ann dumped you?

273
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:21,583
Where did you hear that from?

274
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:23,333
Do you think a guy like me

275
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,916
wanted to get serious
with a girl like Ann?

276
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,250
RICH MAN TRANSPORT

277
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:35,875
Oh, my...

278
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,708
Hello.

279
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,583
Hello, Piak. Hello, Kwan.

280
00:23:41,833 --> 00:23:43,375
Why did you honk?

281
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,791
-Hey.
-Are you deaf or what?

282
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,375
What?

283
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,416
-What are you looking for?
-Your deaf ass.

284
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,041
Are you making money off Kwan's car again?

285
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,166
-Shut up, you jerk.
-Don't.

286
00:23:56,041 --> 00:23:58,791
What's that? Superman with a snub nose?

287
00:23:59,083 --> 00:24:00,166
Hey.

288
00:24:00,250 --> 00:24:01,833
You don't know anything.

289
00:24:01,916 --> 00:24:03,625
This is my get-rich-quick talisman.

290
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,583
The guardian of Northern bus drivers.

291
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,291
Do you see his hands?

292
00:24:07,375 --> 00:24:10,500
He's grabbing a wad of cash
and bringing it to me.

293
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:11,958
Wow.

294
00:24:12,041 --> 00:24:13,375
I bet it doesn't work.

295
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:15,666
-Why not?
-You have a lot of gambling debts.

296
00:24:16,541 --> 00:24:18,416
You still haven't paid me back.

297
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,583
I haven't forgotten.

298
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:21,291
-Let's change the subject.
-Hey.

299
00:24:21,708 --> 00:24:23,333
Kwan, do you want to sell your car?

300
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,583
Yes.

301
00:24:24,916 --> 00:24:26,333
He's going to Bangkok

302
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:28,750
-to have his arm chopped off.
-What?

303
00:24:29,041 --> 00:24:30,708
Really? That's big news!

304
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,291
Stop messing with me, will you?

305
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:37,541
If you're going to Bangkok,
I can give you a ride.

306
00:24:37,708 --> 00:24:39,750
But I'm not leaving until later tonight.

307
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,666
Free of charge, just for you.

308
00:24:42,875 --> 00:24:44,541
I have to return the bus
to Bangkok, anyway.

309
00:24:44,666 --> 00:24:45,958
Boss wants me to drive it back.

310
00:24:46,041 --> 00:24:48,375
It'll be the two of us.
I will drive. You can relax.

311
00:24:48,458 --> 00:24:51,083
We can talk. We'll be there in a flash.

312
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:52,750
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

313
00:25:18,166 --> 00:25:20,083
Kwan, come on up.

314
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,166
A superhero

315
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:24,333
always comes when you need him the most.

316
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:27,791
I thought you'd come at sunrise.

317
00:25:27,875 --> 00:25:29,375
Come on, it's a free ride.

318
00:25:29,541 --> 00:25:31,416
Don't complain.

319
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,958
Be careful with the turn.

320
00:25:33,041 --> 00:25:35,416
Relax, I'm a professional.

321
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,666
Easy.

322
00:25:54,833 --> 00:25:56,041
I really envy you.

323
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,583
-Stop it.
-Why?

324
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,416
Listen.

325
00:26:03,708 --> 00:26:05,625
If I had three arms like you,

326
00:26:06,125 --> 00:26:07,875
I'd grab a porn magazine with two hands

327
00:26:07,958 --> 00:26:11,416
and I'd still have my third hand free

328
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,375
to give myself a hand party!

329
00:26:17,791 --> 00:26:19,875
Or when I sleep with my wife,

330
00:26:20,208 --> 00:26:23,083
I'd have a hand for each tit

331
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,666
and one more to get creative with.

332
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,041
Lorlee, your balls are working harder
than your brain.

333
00:26:35,291 --> 00:26:36,750
Let's stop here.

334
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,708
I have to take a whiz.

335
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:41,083
What's that?

336
00:26:44,333 --> 00:26:46,958
MEN

337
00:26:48,541 --> 00:26:50,375
Let me go!

338
00:26:52,291 --> 00:26:54,125
Are you crazy?

339
00:26:57,375 --> 00:26:58,333
Don't.

340
00:27:00,208 --> 00:27:01,708
-Damn it.
-No.

341
00:27:03,041 --> 00:27:04,208
Where are you going?

342
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:06,541
Let me go. Leave me alone.

343
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:07,833
Let me go.

344
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,166
Don't play hard to get!

345
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:12,208
She's my wife. Mind your own business.

346
00:27:12,791 --> 00:27:14,291
Since when was I your wife, pervert?

347
00:27:15,041 --> 00:27:17,291
What's your problem?

348
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,375
What's your problem?

349
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:26,083
A third arm. What are you?

350
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:36,500
He's down.

351
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:37,583
Damn you.

352
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:38,791
Take this.

353
00:27:46,041 --> 00:27:47,750
What are you doing, Lorlee?

354
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:50,166
So he can't come after us.

355
00:27:51,166 --> 00:27:52,083
Okay.

356
00:27:54,166 --> 00:27:55,500
All right.

357
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,250
Look.

358
00:28:01,875 --> 00:28:03,041
That's quite bushy!

359
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:04,916
It's disgusting.

360
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,375
-Come on.
-Let's go.

361
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,666
Let's see what he's got.

362
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,541
What are you looking at?

363
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,166
No, what are you looking at?

364
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:37,583
Where are you going?

365
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,708
To see my husband in Bangkok.

366
00:28:44,333 --> 00:28:47,416
My husband works there.
A man from the village gave me a ride.

367
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,958
Who would have guessed
that he'd pull over and try to rape me?

368
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,500
I would.

369
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:53,875
Your tits are like watermelons.

370
00:28:56,083 --> 00:28:58,125
You can come with us.
We're going to Bangkok.

371
00:29:01,166 --> 00:29:02,291
My name's Na.

372
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:03,541
Look!

373
00:29:04,833 --> 00:29:06,083
-Oh, shit.
-Oh, shit.

374
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:07,416
SGT. MAJ. PORNCHAI PONGPO

375
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:30,625
Why do you want to chop it off?

376
00:29:32,708 --> 00:29:34,500
-Can't you just keep your mouth shut?
-Hey.

377
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:39,875
With those arms,
you'll get plenty of work in my village.

378
00:29:41,541 --> 00:29:42,416
What sort of work?

379
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:44,458
Sorting green tea leaves.

380
00:29:44,708 --> 00:29:47,208
Thai people drink green tea
more than water now.

381
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:50,000
Those Japanese firms
have put in a lot of money.

382
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:52,041
I'm not bragging,

383
00:29:52,375 --> 00:29:54,125
but my village is getting rich
because of it.

384
00:29:58,583 --> 00:30:00,250
Lorlee, wake me up when we get there.

385
00:30:00,416 --> 00:30:01,375
Okay.

386
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,708
-Lorlee.
-Yes.

387
00:30:12,791 --> 00:30:14,666
Why don't you get on the main highway?

388
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:16,333
Kwan.

389
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,625
We just beat up a cop.

390
00:30:18,708 --> 00:30:21,375
If we get on the highway,
we'll get busted.

391
00:30:23,208 --> 00:30:26,458
Just make sure I get there in time
for the appointment.

392
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,125
Relax, Kwan.

393
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:29,791
Thailand is a small country.

394
00:30:30,041 --> 00:30:31,375
We'll get there in a flash.

395
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:53,125
Kwan, just a moment, please.

396
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,375
Wait for me. I've got something to do.

397
00:30:55,458 --> 00:30:57,166
You guys can look for
something to eat first.

398
00:31:12,583 --> 00:31:15,041
I'll stay here. You go ahead.
I don't want to go.

399
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,500
Come with me.

400
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,958
I don't know this place.

401
00:31:19,041 --> 00:31:20,375
I don't want to go alone.

402
00:31:21,416 --> 00:31:23,166
No, I'm sleepy. I'll get some sleep.

403
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:43,166
Pad thai sounds nice.

404
00:31:43,416 --> 00:31:45,583
PAD THAI

405
00:31:46,458 --> 00:31:47,833
No, I'm sick of it.

406
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:49,625
Let's have some steak.

407
00:31:53,541 --> 00:31:55,375
STEAK

408
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:00,916
Here's your order.

409
00:32:01,708 --> 00:32:02,541
-Miss.
-Thank you.

410
00:32:02,625 --> 00:32:04,583
Is this a steak?
It's nothing like the one in the photo.

411
00:32:04,916 --> 00:32:07,000
Yes, it's northeastern style.

412
00:32:10,458 --> 00:32:11,958
Are we in the northeast?

413
00:32:13,708 --> 00:32:14,875
Damn you, Lorlee.

414
00:32:16,791 --> 00:32:17,958
Just eat your food.

415
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,333
Damn it.

416
00:32:41,708 --> 00:32:42,708
Aren't you hot?

417
00:32:49,625 --> 00:32:52,583
What about you?
You've been holding on to your phone

418
00:32:52,666 --> 00:32:53,875
since we were on the bus.

419
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,250
Are you waiting for a call
from your husband?

420
00:32:57,583 --> 00:33:00,416
Listen, I have an awesome ringtone.

421
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,291
Try calling me.

422
00:33:05,333 --> 00:33:06,833
I don't have a phone.

423
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,000
I have nobody to call.

424
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:13,083
It's Lorlee.

425
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,375
Miss, check, please.

426
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,166
Where is he running off to?

427
00:33:23,708 --> 00:33:25,583
Where are you going? Stop.

428
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:26,958
-Shit.
-Hey.

429
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,250
Wait.

430
00:33:30,625 --> 00:33:32,500
Hey.

431
00:33:35,958 --> 00:33:36,833
Oh, no.

432
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,708
-Hey.
-Hey.

433
00:33:38,791 --> 00:33:40,291
Pay me 70 baht for the steaks.

434
00:33:40,458 --> 00:33:42,375
-Stop the bus. I got the wrong girl.
-Wait.

435
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:49,791
-Stop the bus.
-Hurry.

436
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:51,791
-Wait for me.
-Hurry.

437
00:33:52,041 --> 00:33:52,916
Wait for me.

438
00:33:53,458 --> 00:33:55,583
I said, stop!

439
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,333
They're gone. Let's follow them.

440
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:18,291
-Come on.
-Let's go.

441
00:34:18,375 --> 00:34:19,250
Go!

442
00:34:26,666 --> 00:34:27,708
Her arm was way too fat

443
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,541
to be mistaken for mine.

444
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,250
Who are they, Lorlee?

445
00:34:35,625 --> 00:34:37,166
The thugs from the casino.

446
00:34:37,250 --> 00:34:39,500
I lost to them and owed them money
so they came after me.

447
00:34:39,583 --> 00:34:41,291
What kind of casino opens in the morning?

448
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:43,916
Are you kidding?
Gambling dens never close.

449
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:46,833
Damn it, they're here.

450
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,750
I shouldn't have come with you!

451
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:55,250
Hurry. Don't let them get away. Hurry.

452
00:34:58,833 --> 00:35:00,583
Don't let them get away. Follow them.

453
00:35:02,125 --> 00:35:03,291
-Hey.
-Stop.

454
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:17,666
Kwan, we are safe.

455
00:35:17,958 --> 00:35:20,375
Kwan, what should we do?

456
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,083
How would I know?

457
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:23,333
Oh, no.

458
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,125
Just go through them.

459
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,000
I can't.

460
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:30,458
Don't!

461
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:48,500
-Oh, no.
-What?

462
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,875
The engine died!

463
00:35:49,958 --> 00:35:51,416
Restart it.

464
00:35:54,833 --> 00:35:56,791
How much do you owe them?

465
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:57,958
Forty-five thousand.

466
00:35:58,333 --> 00:35:59,500
Forty-five thousand?

467
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,166
-Yes.
-You were there for five seconds.

468
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,125
Yes.

469
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,333
Hey.

470
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,625
Come down here, you bastards.

471
00:36:05,875 --> 00:36:06,750
All of you.

472
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,041
Why were you with them?

473
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:13,208
Ask them.

474
00:36:13,416 --> 00:36:15,041
Search them.

475
00:36:15,375 --> 00:36:16,291
Hey.

476
00:36:18,666 --> 00:36:19,916
A three-armed man.

477
00:36:20,166 --> 00:36:22,791
Put him on show at a temple fair
and then you can pay off your debts.

478
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:24,791
-Hey.
-What's your problem?

479
00:36:25,208 --> 00:36:27,375
Stop moving or I'll chop off your arm.

480
00:36:27,666 --> 00:36:29,458
That's good.
You don't need to go to Bangkok for it.

481
00:36:29,541 --> 00:36:30,416
Watch your mouth.

482
00:36:30,791 --> 00:36:31,916
Wow.

483
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
With boobs like that,
you can sell her for a lot of money.

484
00:36:35,916 --> 00:36:37,083
You watch too many soap operas.

485
00:36:37,791 --> 00:36:39,625
This is all they've got.

486
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:41,791
-Is this all?
-That's my money.

487
00:36:41,875 --> 00:36:43,416
-What's your problem?
-Hey.

488
00:36:43,666 --> 00:36:45,208
Stop resisting or I'll...

489
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:47,791
Give me my 70 baht.

490
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,375
-Why?
-They haven't paid me yet.

491
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:51,041
-Your 70 baht?
-Yes.

492
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:55,416
All right. Take it. How annoying.

493
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,791
How hard was that?

494
00:36:56,875 --> 00:36:57,916
Lorlee.

495
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,833
What are you going to do?

496
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
This hardly covers what you owe me.

497
00:37:02,041 --> 00:37:04,250
And we haven't even started with
what you did to my car.

498
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,000
That's your problem.

499
00:37:06,416 --> 00:37:09,000
What do you expect me to do?
It's 45,000 baht.

500
00:37:09,083 --> 00:37:10,583
Shit, the police are here!

501
00:37:10,666 --> 00:37:11,750
Let's go.

502
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:13,208
Come on.

503
00:37:13,791 --> 00:37:15,208
-Police!
-Help.

504
00:37:15,291 --> 00:37:17,541
-Police!
-Help us.

505
00:37:17,625 --> 00:37:19,666
-Hey.
-Help us.

506
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:21,750
Kwan, the police are here.

507
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:25,750
I said, stop.

508
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:27,041
Stop right there.

509
00:37:29,458 --> 00:37:31,375
-Hey.
-Stop.

510
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,791
I feel sorry for you.

511
00:37:47,208 --> 00:37:48,041
Why?

512
00:37:48,833 --> 00:37:50,791
You're crippled for life.

513
00:37:52,541 --> 00:37:54,125
If I saw you in the dark,
I'd run for my life.

514
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:58,291
-What's up, sir?
-Kid, excuse me.

515
00:37:58,958 --> 00:38:00,416
Can I take a picture with you?

516
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,458
-I'll show my wife.
-Good.

517
00:38:01,541 --> 00:38:04,291
-She likes weird things.
-Sure. Go ahead.

518
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,583
-All right.
-Do you know how?

519
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,333
-Yes. Are you ready?
-Do you want one?

520
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:10,791
-Okay. Two fingers, please.
-No.

521
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,541
How can you put up two fingers?

522
00:38:12,625 --> 00:38:14,333
He's got three hands,
put up three fingers.

523
00:38:14,416 --> 00:38:15,291
You're right.

524
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,333
Three fingers, then.

525
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,875
-Three fingers.
-Three fingers, okay.

526
00:38:18,958 --> 00:38:21,041
-Smile. Click.
-One, two...

527
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:23,500
One more, please.

528
00:38:23,583 --> 00:38:25,000
-Please.
-One more.

529
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,000
-Okay. One more.
-He's a rare species.

530
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Not bad, sir. That's good.

531
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:30,625
Smile.

532
00:38:30,791 --> 00:38:31,750
Click.

533
00:38:31,833 --> 00:38:32,791
Thank you so much.

534
00:38:32,875 --> 00:38:33,750
Okay.

535
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:35,666
Save one for me, will you?

536
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:38,375
-I'll show my friends.
-Thank you so much.

537
00:38:38,458 --> 00:38:39,458
Good luck.

538
00:38:39,666 --> 00:38:41,125
Are you a human or an octopus?

539
00:38:41,458 --> 00:38:42,708
You've got a lot of arms.

540
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,375
Sir.

541
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:58,291
Let them go.

542
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:02,541
If he didn't let us go,

543
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:05,291
I would have blackmailed him
with this photo,

544
00:39:05,375 --> 00:39:06,750
I would've even sent this to his wife.

545
00:39:06,916 --> 00:39:07,916
Look.

546
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,125
Oh, my god.

547
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,791
Mom, it's all torn up.

548
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:22,333
Okay, ask for money from your dad
when he returns.

549
00:39:26,958 --> 00:39:28,291
Hello, Yod.

550
00:39:28,625 --> 00:39:30,250
Thank you for letting us
stay here tonight.

551
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:32,541
Make yourself at home. It's no problem.

552
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:33,500
Thank you.

553
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:34,750
Hey.

554
00:39:35,458 --> 00:39:38,208
Let's eat. I won a lot today.

555
00:39:41,166 --> 00:39:42,458
I'm waiting for tonight's match.

556
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:44,083
So which team do you like?

557
00:39:44,166 --> 00:39:45,708
Any team that wins.

558
00:39:45,833 --> 00:39:47,500
What a joke.

559
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,125
Come on. Which one?

560
00:39:49,208 --> 00:39:50,791
Well, Germany.

561
00:39:50,875 --> 00:39:51,750
I like England.

562
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:53,500
Do you like Beckham?

563
00:39:53,583 --> 00:39:55,291
-He looks like me.
-Germany...

564
00:39:55,375 --> 00:39:56,250
Come again?

565
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:03,625
It's getting cold. Let's go.

566
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,083
It's lonely out here.

567
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,833
It's okay. We can shower together.

568
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:12,208
Oh, no.

569
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:14,625
Oh, my god.

570
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:19,958
Kwan.

571
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:21,791
-What?
-I think it's payback time.

572
00:40:22,416 --> 00:40:23,791
Hey.

573
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:26,583
Let's take a peek.

574
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,791
No, I don't want trouble.

575
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:34,333
Oh, my... You like her, right?

576
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,208
I can tell, Kwan.

577
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:38,375
But she's already got a husband.

578
00:40:39,041 --> 00:40:39,916
Lorlee.

579
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,041
Shut up.

580
00:40:41,541 --> 00:40:43,958
I'm broke and we're stranded here
because of you.

581
00:40:44,541 --> 00:40:45,833
Go fix your bus.

582
00:40:46,625 --> 00:40:47,916
Yes, sir.

583
00:41:12,791 --> 00:41:14,125
Three arms?

584
00:41:14,375 --> 00:41:15,333
Yes.

585
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:16,875
Our family has been jinxed.

586
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,458
Will he bring us bad luck?

587
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:20,666
We are screwed.

588
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:23,958
Lorlee brought us bad luck.

589
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:25,916
I'm betting on Germany tonight too.

590
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,083
Why don't you kick him out?

591
00:41:28,916 --> 00:41:30,291
Calm down.

592
00:41:30,541 --> 00:41:31,625
Tonight's match,

593
00:41:31,916 --> 00:41:34,041
if Germany wins,

594
00:41:34,125 --> 00:41:36,666
-So?
-it means he's a good luck charm.

595
00:41:36,833 --> 00:41:38,666
But what if they lose?

596
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,208
You've got a point.

597
00:41:40,291 --> 00:41:42,541
Will this thing ever run again, Lorlee?

598
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,791
This is a piece of cake.

599
00:41:44,875 --> 00:41:46,333
It will be done soon.

600
00:41:46,541 --> 00:41:47,958
You can sleep first.

601
00:41:48,041 --> 00:41:49,958
I'll wake you up when it's fixed.

602
00:41:51,166 --> 00:41:53,833
If you can't fix it,
I'll take the bus tomorrow.

603
00:41:53,916 --> 00:41:56,500
Aren't you afraid
that people will look at your arms?

604
00:42:01,541 --> 00:42:02,833
You're looking at them again.

605
00:42:06,083 --> 00:42:07,625
Come on, Germany.

606
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:09,208
I'd be a better player than you.

607
00:42:09,291 --> 00:42:10,625
Run faster, idiots!

608
00:42:10,708 --> 00:42:12,208
Quick!

609
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:13,458
Do better, please.

610
00:42:13,541 --> 00:42:15,500
They're stupid. I knew it.

611
00:42:15,583 --> 00:42:17,125
He is a jinx.

612
00:42:17,208 --> 00:42:18,208
Asshole!

613
00:42:18,666 --> 00:42:20,166
Kwan.

614
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:22,250
-Wake up.
-What?

615
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,500
What is it? I want to sleep.

616
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,000
Well, you can't.

617
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:30,000
-Oh, no.
-What?

618
00:42:36,416 --> 00:42:37,291
Oh, no.

619
00:42:38,625 --> 00:42:40,083
Shit.

620
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,333
Lorlee!

621
00:42:44,791 --> 00:42:46,416
Lorlee!

622
00:42:46,791 --> 00:42:48,083
Lorlee!

623
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:51,166
-Lorlee!
-I'm sorry, Kwan. I need to borrow it.

624
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,125
Please forgive me.

625
00:42:52,208 --> 00:42:55,041
Lorlee, give me my mother's ashes.

626
00:42:55,291 --> 00:42:57,333
-Lorlee!
-Oh, shit. I thought it was cocaine.

627
00:42:57,416 --> 00:42:59,791
Damn it. I almost snorted his mom.

628
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:13,208
Mom.

629
00:44:09,125 --> 00:44:10,666
Sir, can you give us a ride?

630
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:12,708
Come.

631
00:44:14,291 --> 00:44:15,125
Hey.

632
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:17,583
What's wrong with him?

633
00:44:17,958 --> 00:44:19,041
What the hell...

634
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:34,375
Mister, can you give us a ride?

635
00:44:34,458 --> 00:44:35,708
Of course. Get in.

636
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:37,250
Thank you. Let's go.

637
00:44:42,583 --> 00:44:43,666
Come on.

638
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:55,708
Mom.

639
00:44:56,458 --> 00:44:57,916
I was robbed.

640
00:44:58,875 --> 00:45:00,291
I don't know.

641
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,041
How should I know?

642
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,250
I don't even have enough to eat.

643
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,666
Why are you complaining? I don't know.

644
00:45:10,083 --> 00:45:11,541
I don't know where I am.

645
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:17,500
What's your problem now?

646
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,875
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

647
00:45:30,041 --> 00:45:31,166
You're closed on Sundays.

648
00:45:32,166 --> 00:45:33,500
So I'll have to wait until Monday?

649
00:45:41,791 --> 00:45:42,666
Okay.

650
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,583
Hey.

651
00:45:47,208 --> 00:45:48,833
Why didn't you tell me you needed a phone?

652
00:45:48,916 --> 00:45:50,041
You could have borrowed mine.

653
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,500
I didn't want to bother you.

654
00:45:54,666 --> 00:45:55,541
See?

655
00:45:55,958 --> 00:45:57,375
Now you've only got five baht left.

656
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,875
Five or twelve, it makes no difference.

657
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:06,083
Can you call me?

658
00:46:06,166 --> 00:46:07,916
My ringtone is really nice.

659
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,791
Why should I? You're right here.

660
00:46:12,125 --> 00:46:14,458
I want to hear my ringtone, please.

661
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:17,125
Don't be stupid.

662
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,458
Call me, please.

663
00:46:20,541 --> 00:46:21,375
Please.

664
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:26,333
No one has called me

665
00:46:29,041 --> 00:46:30,791
for over a year.

666
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,166
Why don't you just cancel your number?

667
00:46:41,583 --> 00:46:44,291
Then my husband won't be able to reach me.

668
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:01,541
What's your number?

669
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:13,333
I've been waiting for somebody

670
00:47:13,666 --> 00:47:16,625
To wander my way

671
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:18,708
I've been waiting for somebody

672
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:21,625
To have a conversation with

673
00:47:21,708 --> 00:47:24,208
To see his face

674
00:47:24,291 --> 00:47:25,958
To say hello

675
00:47:26,125 --> 00:47:27,666
To...

676
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,041
Wasn't it beautiful?

677
00:47:29,458 --> 00:47:31,416
Why did you answer it?

678
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,666
I'm right here.

679
00:47:32,875 --> 00:47:34,375
The last five baht.

680
00:47:35,666 --> 00:47:36,583
I forgot.

681
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:40,166
Hold on!

682
00:47:41,208 --> 00:47:42,208
Then,

683
00:47:42,291 --> 00:47:45,333
let's just talk until the money runs out.

684
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,833
Now you can talk to me through the phone.

685
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:00,750
What do you want to talk about?

686
00:48:02,041 --> 00:48:04,375
Say something before the credits run out.

687
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,541
I can't think of anything.

688
00:48:12,291 --> 00:48:13,583
Say whatever you want.

689
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,333
Just talk to me.

690
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:54,833
Let's go.

691
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,041
Eat it. Don't think too much.

692
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:37,125
I can't. We bought it with dirty money.

693
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,375
What's so dirty about donation money?

694
00:49:41,958 --> 00:49:43,125
You stole it.

695
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,166
They donated the money to charity.

696
00:49:46,291 --> 00:49:48,625
We used the money
because we're broke and starving.

697
00:49:49,958 --> 00:49:51,500
The donors are still doing good deeds.

698
00:49:52,791 --> 00:49:55,416
And we didn't take it all,

699
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:57,041
we just took enough to buy a meal.

700
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:08,500
Eat it. We don't know
when we'll get to eat again.

701
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:13,375
A guy like me doesn't need
to eat something bought with stolen money.

702
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:21,666
Here.

703
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:28,583
Isn't this considered stealing too?

704
00:50:28,666 --> 00:50:30,041
Somebody owns these trees.

705
00:50:31,333 --> 00:50:32,541
It's not the same.

706
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,833
The owner neglected them.

707
00:50:37,375 --> 00:50:38,375
Catch it.

708
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:39,750
Throw it properly!

709
00:50:39,833 --> 00:50:41,166
It's perfectly ripe.

710
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:46,291
-Hey.
-Hey!

711
00:50:46,375 --> 00:50:47,250
I'm sorry.

712
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,083
Throw it one at a time.

713
00:50:53,458 --> 00:50:56,041
It looks kind of weird. Can we eat it?

714
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:01,416
It doesn't look weird.

715
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,708
You don't know anything.
This tastes great.

716
00:51:29,291 --> 00:51:31,708
What are you doing there? Come here.

717
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:32,958
Come this way.

718
00:51:33,166 --> 00:51:35,791
-Let's go this way.
-Let's go that way.

719
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:38,500
We can't go that way.
Trust me, it's this way.

720
00:51:39,708 --> 00:51:41,625
The train's coming. Come here.

721
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:31,291
Na.

722
00:52:31,791 --> 00:52:32,875
Do you know

723
00:52:33,291 --> 00:52:34,833
the legend surrounding this tree?

724
00:52:35,916 --> 00:52:36,916
What legend?

725
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,041
You see,

726
00:52:41,083 --> 00:52:42,166
it has golden leaves.

727
00:52:43,458 --> 00:52:45,083
In the olden days,
the leaves weren't gold.

728
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,166
They were green like every other tree.

729
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:51,666
But this tree didn't want
to be like other trees.

730
00:52:52,291 --> 00:52:55,125
So it asked a god

731
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:59,416
to turn it gold.

732
00:53:01,083 --> 00:53:02,166
Why?

733
00:53:04,750 --> 00:53:05,958
I guess it wanted to be cool.

734
00:53:07,416 --> 00:53:09,333
After the god turned it gold,

735
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,125
the tree got bored after a few days.

736
00:53:14,416 --> 00:53:15,958
It wanted to be green again.

737
00:53:18,166 --> 00:53:19,208
But the god

738
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:21,916
had ascended the Seventh Heaven

739
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,791
and couldn't come back.

740
00:53:24,291 --> 00:53:26,000
That's why the leaves
remain gold to this day.

741
00:53:26,708 --> 00:53:27,708
Did you make that up?

742
00:53:28,916 --> 00:53:30,041
No.

743
00:53:34,083 --> 00:53:35,458
And do you see that tree?

744
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:40,833
It used to be a very small tree,

745
00:53:41,708 --> 00:53:42,875
much smaller than all the others.

746
00:53:44,083 --> 00:53:45,791
So it then asked a god for help.

747
00:53:45,875 --> 00:53:47,083
Hey,

748
00:53:47,166 --> 00:53:48,458
stay away from my god.

749
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:50,583
How did you know?

750
00:53:51,708 --> 00:53:54,833
Well, your god had ascended
to the Seventh Heaven, right?

751
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,375
So the tree asked an angel instead.

752
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:01,041
The angel was nice enough to let it grow.

753
00:54:02,083 --> 00:54:03,083
However,

754
00:54:04,416 --> 00:54:05,958
it became so tall

755
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:08,958
that the other trees
didn't want to stay near it.

756
00:54:10,791 --> 00:54:12,041
It got stressed out.

757
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:14,375
So I begged the angel for help again.

758
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:17,375
The angel was kind

759
00:54:18,916 --> 00:54:21,916
so she let it stay with this golden tree.

760
00:54:25,291 --> 00:54:28,416
And even though
they're the last two trees on earth,

761
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:30,791
they're happy together.

762
00:54:44,416 --> 00:54:46,958
Wait here, I'll hitch a ride.

763
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:48,625
No.

764
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:50,916
Let me do it. I got one this morning.

765
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:56,166
Come on. Let's take turns. I'll go first.

766
00:55:02,791 --> 00:55:04,375
Don't forget to vote...

767
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:08,541
Let me try another one.

768
00:55:09,708 --> 00:55:13,041
If you didn't have those boobs,

769
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:14,833
nobody would've picked us up.

770
00:55:15,875 --> 00:55:16,875
But me?

771
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:18,916
I always have to cover my third arm.

772
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,208
Otherwise, they might run me over.

773
00:55:22,041 --> 00:55:23,333
What's the point of hiding it

774
00:55:23,416 --> 00:55:25,375
when it's a part of you, anyway?

775
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:28,833
Well, it won't be soon.

776
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,500
You'll miss it then.

777
00:55:34,666 --> 00:55:36,666
Why would I? It's useless.

778
00:55:38,041 --> 00:55:39,583
Unlike your breasts.

779
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:40,958
You can get a ride with them.

780
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:45,166
Okay, you're right.

781
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:48,000
People only look at my tits.
They ignore the rest of me.

782
00:55:50,583 --> 00:55:53,791
Of course. They stick out like signposts.

783
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,833
You know people look at them,
so why wear such clothes?

784
00:55:59,041 --> 00:55:59,916
Are you jealous?

785
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,041
No, you're crazy.

786
00:56:04,833 --> 00:56:06,250
I wear these clothes

787
00:56:06,333 --> 00:56:09,125
because if there's a guy
who doesn't look at my breasts,

788
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:12,125
it means he's an okay guy.

789
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:15,250
What do you mean "an okay guy"?

790
00:56:15,333 --> 00:56:18,500
It means he's a nice guy.

791
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:21,208
You're dumb.

792
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:24,291
Men don't think that "sex"
and "personality" are the same things.

793
00:56:25,583 --> 00:56:27,000
They think of them as different things.

794
00:56:27,375 --> 00:56:30,458
Even the nicest guy
will look at your boobs

795
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:32,291
if he sees you in those clothes.

796
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,291
Sure, I'm dumb.

797
00:56:39,583 --> 00:56:41,583
I have big tits and I'm dumb as a rock.

798
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,125
Happy?

799
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:50,875
I was joking.

800
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:54,500
I don't always look at your boobs.

801
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:02,458
Are you saying you're an okay guy?

802
00:57:15,541 --> 00:57:17,333
Sure, I'm so useless.

803
00:57:18,958 --> 00:57:21,333
What's the matter?

804
00:57:21,541 --> 00:57:23,791
You don't have to get upset
because he didn't stop.

805
00:57:26,166 --> 00:57:28,166
Do you only have three arms
or are you bald too?

806
00:57:34,291 --> 00:57:35,708
I'll do it.

807
00:57:38,416 --> 00:57:40,750
Please stop.

808
00:57:45,458 --> 00:57:47,333
Will you please give me a ride?

809
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:50,083
Thank you.

810
00:57:50,541 --> 00:57:51,583
Come on.

811
00:57:57,333 --> 00:57:58,458
Hey, come up.

812
00:57:58,583 --> 00:58:00,708
Please stop.

813
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:02,833
Come up.

814
00:58:04,083 --> 00:58:06,416
You should go.
It's easier for us this way.

815
00:58:06,791 --> 00:58:08,875
What if he tries to rape me too?

816
00:58:09,666 --> 00:58:10,583
What?

817
00:58:37,583 --> 00:58:38,625
Hello.

818
00:58:38,708 --> 00:58:40,416
TOILET

819
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,541
Is that you, babe?

820
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:45,416
I'm about to stop. I need to poop.

821
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:47,916
I know. I'm not stopping anywhere else.

822
00:58:49,125 --> 00:58:50,208
Yes.

823
00:58:50,791 --> 00:58:52,958
All right. I'm almost in town.

824
00:58:54,166 --> 00:58:56,250
My stomach hurts,
so I have to stop at a gas station.

825
00:58:58,166 --> 00:59:00,166
Okay. Do you want anything?

826
00:59:01,875 --> 00:59:03,833
Okay. I'll buy it for you.

827
00:59:40,541 --> 00:59:42,208
Sir, please stop.

828
00:59:43,208 --> 00:59:44,333
Please stop.

829
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,541
Please stop.

830
00:59:49,125 --> 00:59:50,625
Who are you?

831
00:59:50,708 --> 00:59:53,083
When did you get in my truck?
Where are you going?

832
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:55,208
Hey.

833
01:00:53,416 --> 01:00:55,958
It looks kind of weird. Can we eat it?

834
01:00:58,791 --> 01:00:59,708
It doesn't look weird.

835
01:01:00,416 --> 01:01:02,833
You don't know anything.
This tastes great.

836
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:23,541
HOW COULD I DIE HERE?

837
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:27,291
IT WOULD BE THE MOST SHAMEFUL DEATH

838
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,291
A glowing light

839
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:41,541
and a voice,

840
01:01:41,958 --> 01:01:43,541
they're calling for me.

841
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:47,458
Faces of angels appear before me.

842
01:01:49,333 --> 01:01:52,208
They beckoned me to come to them.

843
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:56,833
If I had let them take me,

844
01:01:57,291 --> 01:01:58,916
I wouldn't be sitting here now.

845
01:02:01,125 --> 01:02:02,458
But it's strange.

846
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,083
The face I saw wasn't my mother's.

847
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,083
Aren't you going to say anything?

848
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:15,541
What's your name?

849
01:02:15,666 --> 01:02:16,625
I am Thai.

850
01:02:17,708 --> 01:02:18,875
What did you say?

851
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,291
I am Thai.

852
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:40,458
There are more cops
than buffaloes around here.

853
01:02:40,541 --> 01:02:42,291
Excuse me, may I see your license?

854
01:02:43,041 --> 01:02:44,333
Where are you headed?

855
01:02:44,416 --> 01:02:46,250
Get out of the truck.
We have to search it.

856
01:03:02,125 --> 01:03:03,250
What's in the box?

857
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:04,750
They're all fish.

858
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:06,750
Search it.

859
01:03:14,583 --> 01:03:15,583
They're fish.

860
01:03:27,041 --> 01:03:29,291
I guess the fish aren't dead yet.

861
01:03:30,958 --> 01:03:32,375
Bring them down.

862
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:42,916
Hey.

863
01:03:43,916 --> 01:03:45,625
Come on. Hurry.

864
01:04:10,958 --> 01:04:12,208
Get up.

865
01:04:12,916 --> 01:04:15,166
Now, get up.

866
01:04:15,666 --> 01:04:17,083
-I'm Thai.
-I'm Thai.

867
01:04:17,166 --> 01:04:19,083
-Where are you from?
-I'm Thai.

868
01:04:20,041 --> 01:04:21,666
Yes, I know.

869
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:22,875
Is that all you can say?

870
01:04:22,958 --> 01:04:24,708
-I'm Thai.
-I'm Thai.

871
01:04:26,625 --> 01:04:28,291
Sure, you are.

872
01:04:28,375 --> 01:04:30,083
Sing me the national anthem.

873
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,750
-I'm Thai.
-I'm Thai.

874
01:04:33,833 --> 01:04:37,375
Thailand embraces all people of Thai blood

875
01:04:37,708 --> 01:04:40,833
Every part of the land
Belongs to Thai people

876
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:44,208
We've maintained our sovereignty

877
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:46,958
Because Thais are

878
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:48,333
United...

879
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:50,208
What the...

880
01:04:52,958 --> 01:04:54,208
What more do you want?

881
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:56,333
I said I am Thai.
Why don't you believe me, Squad Leader?

882
01:04:57,333 --> 01:04:59,083
I'm a sergeant, not a squad leader.

883
01:04:59,416 --> 01:05:00,333
Whatever.

884
01:05:00,416 --> 01:05:03,291
I have sung the anthem.
Immigrants can't speak Thai this well.

885
01:05:04,041 --> 01:05:06,041
But you don't have an ID.

886
01:05:06,125 --> 01:05:09,458
I told you, it got stolen.
Why don't you believe me, Squad Leader?

887
01:05:09,666 --> 01:05:10,541
It's "Sergeant"!

888
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:12,291
But there's something
suspicious about you.

889
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,166
I'll have to run a check.

890
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:17,250
What is it? Just say it.

891
01:05:19,166 --> 01:05:21,541
Cut off his dick! You son of a bitch!

892
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:23,666
You're a useless shithead. Bastard!

893
01:05:43,583 --> 01:05:46,458
Everyone seriously tries to nail you.

894
01:05:54,083 --> 01:05:55,166
Hey.

895
01:06:00,583 --> 01:06:01,625
Don't be mad at me.

896
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:07,708
Please,

897
01:06:08,333 --> 01:06:09,750
stop being mad.

898
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:12,125
I'm...

899
01:06:14,333 --> 01:06:15,250
I'm sorry.

900
01:06:15,958 --> 01:06:17,666
-Oh, my god.
-Hey.

901
01:06:21,875 --> 01:06:23,416
Men are all bastards.

902
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,791
They all leave me on my own.

903
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,833
My husband is the worst.

904
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,583
He wanted to become a magician,

905
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,875
so he ran away with the troop
that came to perform.

906
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:48,625
He's been gone for a year
and never sent a word.

907
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:54,208
If someone hadn't found him
at a club in Bangkok,

908
01:06:56,416 --> 01:06:58,375
I would've grown old waiting for him.

909
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:05,541
What if he doesn't want to come home?

910
01:07:05,625 --> 01:07:06,500
What will you do?

911
01:07:09,875 --> 01:07:11,958
My mom said
I can find myself a new husband.

912
01:07:41,041 --> 01:07:41,916
I'm...

913
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,125
I'm glad I ran into you again.

914
01:07:58,583 --> 01:07:59,583
Here.

915
01:08:00,625 --> 01:08:01,625
Let's go.

916
01:08:08,291 --> 01:08:10,875
Hold my hand

917
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:14,958
And together we can face the world

918
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:19,333
With me, you'll never walk alone

919
01:08:20,083 --> 01:08:22,291
Hold my hand

920
01:08:22,375 --> 01:08:23,291
I'm glad too.

921
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:26,791
No one will feel alone

922
01:08:26,875 --> 01:08:29,250
And no one

923
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:33,250
Will walk alone

924
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,666
Watch your steps.

925
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:30,125
We have to find a place to sleep.

926
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:35,083
But we don't have any money.

927
01:10:09,208 --> 01:10:10,333
It's like a school trip.

928
01:10:11,708 --> 01:10:12,833
Keep it down.

929
01:10:36,041 --> 01:10:37,958
It's a bit creepy.

930
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:56,958
If you were born back in the day,

931
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,375
men would want to jump you every day.

932
01:11:03,916 --> 01:11:05,666
If you were born back in the day,

933
01:11:06,208 --> 01:11:08,000
you wouldn't have a jacket
to hide your third arm.

934
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,125
Don't look.

935
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:23,750
CAN I TOUCH YOUR BOOBS?

936
01:11:23,833 --> 01:11:24,958
What did you say?

937
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,958
-Pervert.
-What?

938
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,125
DID I SAY IT OUT LOUD?

939
01:11:33,208 --> 01:11:34,208
I'm...

940
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:36,250
I'm sorry.

941
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:39,791
Again?

942
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,458
My boobs again?

943
01:11:48,583 --> 01:11:51,041
Does nobody care about my other parts?

944
01:11:57,916 --> 01:11:59,416
What if I don't let you touch me...

945
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:06,666
What if we just kiss...

946
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:08,708
Do you want to?

947
01:12:16,916 --> 01:12:18,041
Do you want to?

948
01:12:19,375 --> 01:12:20,583
Are you crazy?

949
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:22,791
I'm not going to touch or kiss you.

950
01:12:24,291 --> 01:12:25,416
It was an accident.

951
01:12:26,166 --> 01:12:27,125
I'm sorry.

952
01:12:31,541 --> 01:12:32,625
Why not?

953
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:35,708
I said it was an accident.

954
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:37,291
I didn't mean to.

955
01:12:41,708 --> 01:12:42,708
Look.

956
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:46,416
I...

957
01:12:49,333 --> 01:12:50,875
I really won't mind if you kiss me.

958
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,125
What?

959
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,625
Can you not be so easy?

960
01:12:55,166 --> 01:12:56,500
You have a husband.

961
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:11,916
All right.

962
01:13:13,250 --> 01:13:14,208
Fine.

963
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,333
Who's there?

964
01:13:40,833 --> 01:13:41,708
Hey!

965
01:13:46,625 --> 01:13:48,166
Don't wake up late

966
01:13:48,250 --> 01:13:50,583
or the morning shift guy
will take it out on me.

967
01:13:51,083 --> 01:13:52,958
And just sleep, no messing around.

968
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:54,375
Respect the building.

969
01:13:56,041 --> 01:13:58,333
Girl, your face is so pale.

970
01:13:58,666 --> 01:14:00,666
-Did you lose something?
-What...

971
01:14:00,750 --> 01:14:02,416
What do you mean?

972
01:14:09,375 --> 01:14:11,250
Will I find it?

973
01:14:11,833 --> 01:14:13,000
Accept it.

974
01:14:13,250 --> 01:14:15,791
What's been lost is no longer yours.

975
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:22,458
Are you making things up?

976
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:23,666
Read mine.

977
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:28,958
This is a tough one.

978
01:14:29,041 --> 01:14:30,458
Which one is your real palm?

979
01:14:31,458 --> 01:14:32,625
All of them.

980
01:14:33,791 --> 01:14:35,791
Just pick one for me.

981
01:14:45,833 --> 01:14:48,166
They look totally different,

982
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:49,666
but they both speak of sadness.

983
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:52,208
You don't see

984
01:14:52,333 --> 01:14:53,750
anything good in our lives.

985
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:55,666
I just told you what I saw.

986
01:14:56,875 --> 01:14:59,125
I don't want to be sad.
I want to be happy.

987
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:12,458
It's up to how much you can spare.

988
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:14,500
I can use the money
to dispel your bad luck.

989
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:16,416
Do we need money?

990
01:15:16,500 --> 01:15:17,666
We don't have any.

991
01:15:22,916 --> 01:15:25,041
Then get ready

992
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:26,583
for what's coming.

993
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:25,708
Come here. Quick.

994
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:32,500
Don't do it.

995
01:16:36,083 --> 01:16:38,458
Come on. We need to eat.

996
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:41,666
Don't do it, please.

997
01:17:04,041 --> 01:17:05,041
Listen.

998
01:17:06,041 --> 01:17:08,041
You can do your arm trick

999
01:17:08,125 --> 01:17:09,541
at the temple lawn to earn some money.

1000
01:17:11,791 --> 01:17:13,208
I'm not a clown.

1001
01:17:14,916 --> 01:17:16,750
But we're hungry, aren't we?

1002
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:25,583
Now we'll bless the congregation.

1003
01:18:04,791 --> 01:18:06,125
Two glasses of Coke.

1004
01:18:25,250 --> 01:18:26,333
Do you want some?

1005
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:06,833
Tee!

1006
01:19:06,916 --> 01:19:08,333
-Tee!
-Tee!

1007
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,333
Are you hurt? Thank you so much.

1008
01:19:11,416 --> 01:19:12,833
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you so much.

1009
01:19:12,916 --> 01:19:14,291
Are you all right?

1010
01:19:14,375 --> 01:19:15,791
I told you to watch him.

1011
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:17,416
Why didn't you?

1012
01:19:17,500 --> 01:19:19,250
Are you all right?

1013
01:19:19,333 --> 01:19:20,750
Thank you.

1014
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:24,041
We can't accept it.

1015
01:19:24,541 --> 01:19:26,125
Take it.

1016
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:28,333
I'll drive you
to the bus terminal tomorrow.

1017
01:19:28,416 --> 01:19:29,750
You can take the morning bus.

1018
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:31,291
Take it.

1019
01:19:33,791 --> 01:19:35,791
Thank you so much. Sorry for the bother.

1020
01:19:35,875 --> 01:19:37,083
It's okay.

1021
01:19:37,166 --> 01:19:38,916
Kwan saved Tee's life.

1022
01:19:39,916 --> 01:19:41,208
This is the least I can do.

1023
01:19:41,291 --> 01:19:43,958
Stop playing, Tee. Dinner is here.

1024
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Come eat first.

1025
01:19:54,208 --> 01:19:55,666
Tee, wash your hands.

1026
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,666
But, Mommy,

1027
01:19:57,750 --> 01:19:59,458
I just washed them.

1028
01:19:59,583 --> 01:20:00,708
Wash them again.

1029
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:02,708
Wash your hands now.

1030
01:20:05,416 --> 01:20:08,125
-This is your favorite.
-Let me help.

1031
01:20:24,125 --> 01:20:25,333
Wow.

1032
01:20:25,416 --> 01:20:26,875
It's really delicious.

1033
01:20:37,791 --> 01:20:39,791
-Tee.
-No, Tee.

1034
01:20:39,875 --> 01:20:40,958
You can't eat that.

1035
01:20:41,250 --> 01:20:43,583
He's a cursed, three-armed freak.

1036
01:20:43,708 --> 01:20:45,083
You didn't listen to me.

1037
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:56,250
I'm a disease.

1038
01:20:59,083 --> 01:21:01,083
Everybody has always been disgusted by me.

1039
01:21:06,000 --> 01:21:07,541
When I was born,

1040
01:21:10,416 --> 01:21:12,083
my father was shocked.

1041
01:21:13,208 --> 01:21:14,375
He was repulsed

1042
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:16,958
by my three arms.

1043
01:21:20,875 --> 01:21:23,541
He ran away from us,

1044
01:21:27,291 --> 01:21:30,083
leaving my mother to raise me by herself.

1045
01:21:35,916 --> 01:21:37,208
A few years ago,

1046
01:21:40,750 --> 01:21:42,000
my mother heard that

1047
01:21:42,083 --> 01:21:43,291
he had moved

1048
01:21:44,750 --> 01:21:45,958
to Bangkok.

1049
01:21:51,083 --> 01:21:53,083
She insisted that I take her to see him.

1050
01:21:56,791 --> 01:21:58,666
But I never did...

1051
01:22:04,625 --> 01:22:05,708
until...

1052
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:08,875
she passed away.

1053
01:22:16,041 --> 01:22:17,666
But who would want to see him?

1054
01:22:22,625 --> 01:22:24,625
What if he still found me...

1055
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:28,041
disgusting?

1056
01:22:33,416 --> 01:22:34,958
I don't even dare to

1057
01:22:36,958 --> 01:22:38,500
leave the village.

1058
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:48,000
Are my three arms really that hideous?

1059
01:22:58,666 --> 01:22:59,666
No.

1060
01:23:01,208 --> 01:23:02,416
You're okay.

1061
01:23:14,583 --> 01:23:15,750
Am I?

1062
01:24:10,541 --> 01:24:12,625
DON'T WAKE UP YET

1063
01:24:16,125 --> 01:24:18,166
DON'T...

1064
01:24:23,416 --> 01:24:26,666
DON'T WAKE UP YET

1065
01:24:51,750 --> 01:24:52,833
Attention, please.

1066
01:24:53,125 --> 01:24:58,833
Passengers waiting for bus 21-1
headed to Bangkok,

1067
01:24:58,916 --> 01:25:01,333
please board platform 12.

1068
01:25:01,416 --> 01:25:04,458
Please make your way to the platform.

1069
01:25:04,541 --> 01:25:05,583
Right now...

1070
01:25:32,875 --> 01:25:35,166
HOURS: MONDAY TO FRIDAY
8 A.M. TO 5 P.M.

1071
01:25:35,250 --> 01:25:37,583
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY ARE HOLIDAYS

1072
01:25:46,125 --> 01:25:47,750
Do you still want to cut it off?

1073
01:25:59,583 --> 01:26:01,666
POR KUNGPAO CLUB

1074
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:04,958
Oh, my... It's so scary

1075
01:26:05,583 --> 01:26:08,625
Will I... Will I die?

1076
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:13,000
I guess we have to try
In order to find out

1077
01:26:19,958 --> 01:26:21,541
All right. Next,

1078
01:26:21,625 --> 01:26:24,500
we'll play our last song for tonight.

1079
01:26:24,583 --> 01:26:27,458
Then the magician will take center stage.

1080
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:30,583
I don't want to watch anymore.

1081
01:26:42,333 --> 01:26:45,708
You didn't tell me that you don't love me

1082
01:26:46,166 --> 01:26:49,333
You let me assume things

1083
01:26:49,416 --> 01:26:52,625
I thought we were friends

1084
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:54,833
But if I leave,

1085
01:26:55,458 --> 01:26:57,583
then what will be the point
of fighting my way here?

1086
01:26:57,666 --> 01:26:59,458
You didn't tell me

1087
01:26:59,708 --> 01:27:02,666
You tricked me into dreaming

1088
01:27:03,125 --> 01:27:04,541
You made me confused

1089
01:27:04,791 --> 01:27:06,416
You tricked me into daydreaming

1090
01:27:06,500 --> 01:27:09,000
You let me be obsessed with you every day

1091
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:11,875
What a twist! This is huge

1092
01:27:11,958 --> 01:27:13,208
Where are you going?

1093
01:27:14,208 --> 01:27:15,125
I need to pee.

1094
01:27:15,791 --> 01:27:17,416
This twist

1095
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:19,375
Is making me lose control

1096
01:27:19,791 --> 01:27:22,416
Who will I get it back from?

1097
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:33,958
Why didn't you ask for her number?

1098
01:27:34,208 --> 01:27:36,500
Her tits are the size of my head.

1099
01:27:36,583 --> 01:27:37,583
Damn.

1100
01:27:38,291 --> 01:27:39,958
I really want to nail her.

1101
01:27:40,833 --> 01:27:42,833
It looks like she wants it too.

1102
01:27:43,250 --> 01:27:44,583
You should go for it.

1103
01:27:44,666 --> 01:27:46,416
She's perfect for 69-ing.

1104
01:27:46,500 --> 01:27:47,708
Do you like 69-ing?

1105
01:27:48,791 --> 01:27:50,375
Can you handle it?

1106
01:27:50,458 --> 01:27:52,750
-Damn. Let's do it.
-Let's not do a 69.

1107
01:27:52,833 --> 01:27:54,041
Let's go for a sandwich.

1108
01:27:54,125 --> 01:27:56,333
The three of us will make a Big Mac!

1109
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,625
How tasty.

1110
01:27:59,958 --> 01:28:01,375
We'll chew her up.

1111
01:28:01,458 --> 01:28:02,958
We'll chew her up really well.

1112
01:28:40,833 --> 01:28:42,791
-Are you blind?
-I'm sorry.

1113
01:28:42,875 --> 01:28:45,000
-Watch where you're going.
-I didn't mean to.

1114
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:46,666
Do you think you're a hotshot?

1115
01:28:46,791 --> 01:28:48,791
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
-Do you want trouble?

1116
01:28:48,875 --> 01:28:50,291
What the hell is wrong with you?

1117
01:28:50,375 --> 01:28:51,375
-What?
-I didn't mean to.

1118
01:28:51,458 --> 01:28:52,833
-Do you want trouble?
-Don't look at me.

1119
01:28:52,916 --> 01:28:54,250
-I'm sorry.
-What?

1120
01:28:54,333 --> 01:28:55,750
I really didn't mean to.

1121
01:28:55,833 --> 01:28:57,875
-I'm sorry.
-You have three arms,

1122
01:28:57,958 --> 01:29:00,333
so show them you're better than them.

1123
01:29:04,125 --> 01:29:06,041
If your friends hit you again,

1124
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:07,625
just hit them right back.

1125
01:29:07,708 --> 01:29:09,583
You have more fists than they do, anyway.

1126
01:29:09,666 --> 01:29:11,041
So what now?

1127
01:29:11,125 --> 01:29:12,083
-What?
-I'm sorry.

1128
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:13,375
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

1129
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:26,583
-Are you pissing me off?
-Do you think three arms are better?

1130
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:30,541
Don't act so cool.

1131
01:29:30,625 --> 01:29:32,166
You're a hotshot?

1132
01:29:32,958 --> 01:29:34,250
Here. Take it.

1133
01:29:34,333 --> 01:29:36,041
So? Are you cool?

1134
01:29:36,458 --> 01:29:37,333
Take this.

1135
01:29:39,291 --> 01:29:41,041
-Take this.
-There.

1136
01:30:55,458 --> 01:30:57,333
Mom, I don't want to be special anymore.

1137
01:30:58,666 --> 01:31:00,333
I want to be normal.

1138
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:03,875
You didn't tell me the truth.

1139
01:31:05,083 --> 01:31:06,541
That being "special"

1140
01:31:07,166 --> 01:31:08,583
also means being a monster.

1141
01:32:04,833 --> 01:32:06,166
I'm going home.

1142
01:32:56,416 --> 01:32:57,875
Don't chop your arm off.

1143
01:33:35,833 --> 01:33:37,458
We're both losers.

1144
01:33:58,041 --> 01:33:59,916
Which arm are you going to cut off?

1145
01:35:59,583 --> 01:36:01,291
Don't be angry with me.

1146
01:36:10,083 --> 01:36:11,500
Are you Kwan?

1147
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:13,208
Mister.

1148
01:36:13,958 --> 01:36:15,375
Are you Kwan?

1149
01:36:19,250 --> 01:36:20,333
Hello, Doctor.

1150
01:36:22,791 --> 01:36:24,041
Are you ready?

1151
01:37:15,958 --> 01:37:18,875
SHIT... IS IT ALREADY GONE?

1152
01:38:22,083 --> 01:38:25,208
DON'T CRY

1153
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:28,625
Today's episode of Life Finds The Way

1154
01:38:28,708 --> 01:38:31,291
has the great honor

1155
01:38:31,708 --> 01:38:35,500
of witnessing a major medical achievement.

1156
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:42,541
Doctor, how do you feel
after this successful operation?

1157
01:39:00,125 --> 01:39:01,166
And here's the man

1158
01:39:01,666 --> 01:39:03,291
who once had three arms.

1159
01:39:03,791 --> 01:39:06,333
He's now left with just two.

1160
01:39:07,625 --> 01:39:10,041
How do you feel now?

1161
01:39:16,125 --> 01:39:17,166
I...

1162
01:39:19,083 --> 01:39:20,750
I feel light.

1163
01:39:21,041 --> 01:39:23,375
It feels like something is missing.

1164
01:39:23,666 --> 01:39:26,458
Of course, your arm's gone.

1165
01:39:31,083 --> 01:39:32,375
Doctor.

1166
01:39:32,458 --> 01:39:34,125
After this operation,

1167
01:39:34,208 --> 01:39:37,833
do you have any other exciting operations

1168
01:39:37,916 --> 01:39:39,250
lined up?

1169
01:39:39,958 --> 01:39:42,500
Now, we have another patient.

1170
01:39:42,583 --> 01:39:44,208
-He's a man.
-I see.

1171
01:39:44,291 --> 01:39:47,083
However, somehow,

1172
01:39:47,166 --> 01:39:49,041
he's with child.

1173
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:07,041
You can't take it back.

1174
01:40:07,125 --> 01:40:11,208
We need your arm
for genetic transplant research.

1175
01:40:11,291 --> 01:40:13,041
Yours is a major case study,

1176
01:40:13,125 --> 01:40:16,875
and your severed limb
will contribute to the future of humanity.

1177
01:40:17,416 --> 01:40:21,833
HUMANITY?

1178
01:40:51,750 --> 01:40:53,041
A special portion with eggs, please.

1179
01:42:18,708 --> 01:42:23,458
NIYOM PAD THAI ON CHAN ROAD

1180
01:42:45,291 --> 01:42:47,416
-He fell down.
-Where are you going?

1181
01:42:48,000 --> 01:42:49,291
Get up. Go.

1182
01:45:28,125 --> 01:45:29,583
-Catch him.
-Hey.

1183
01:45:30,291 --> 01:45:31,833
Stop right there.

1184
01:45:59,416 --> 01:46:02,500
A MIRACLE

1185
01:47:07,500 --> 01:47:09,791
Kwan, is that really you?

1186
01:47:09,958 --> 01:47:11,291
I thought it was someone else.

1187
01:47:11,791 --> 01:47:13,166
Who?

1188
01:47:13,625 --> 01:47:16,416
I don't know. Just someone else.

1189
01:47:16,708 --> 01:47:18,708
You don't have three arms anymore.

1190
01:47:18,791 --> 01:47:20,208
I thought you were someone else.

1191
01:47:20,625 --> 01:47:23,000
When did you cut it off?

1192
01:47:27,541 --> 01:47:30,458
You look funny with two arms,
it's so unlike you.

1193
01:48:45,625 --> 01:48:48,208
I just realized
that it's not about the arm.

1194
01:48:54,666 --> 01:48:56,875
It's the fact that
I don't have anyone like my mother

1195
01:49:00,541 --> 01:49:02,375
or Tawee in my life anymore.

1196
01:49:04,083 --> 01:49:08,750
TAWEE CHANHORM
BORN 1952, DIED 2006

1197
01:49:16,166 --> 01:49:17,208
I'm sorry.

1198
01:49:25,083 --> 01:49:27,041
I'm sorry I didn't go
to your engagement party.

1199
01:49:34,708 --> 01:49:36,416
I only have two arms now.

1200
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,500
It was good that you didn't show up.

1201
01:49:41,916 --> 01:49:44,041
I would have been uncomfortable otherwise.

1202
01:49:47,458 --> 01:49:49,208
Excuse us, then.

1203
01:49:53,541 --> 01:49:55,625
We didn't send him an invitation, right?

1204
01:49:55,708 --> 01:49:57,208
No, we didn't.

1205
01:50:12,916 --> 01:50:14,416
Did I only lose my arm?

1206
01:50:17,708 --> 01:50:19,583
Or did I lose something else too?

1207
01:50:30,291 --> 01:50:32,625
EMPLOYEE OF THE MONTH

1208
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:34,708
Ann, are you busy?

1209
01:50:35,416 --> 01:50:36,708
Give Kwan a hand.

1210
01:50:44,333 --> 01:50:46,583
At this rate,
we'll miss the afternoon truck.

1211
01:50:49,708 --> 01:50:50,791
What a waste.

1212
01:51:01,791 --> 01:51:02,833
Hello.

1213
01:51:03,791 --> 01:51:04,791
Yes.

1214
01:51:05,666 --> 01:51:07,666
I can't talk. I'm working.

1215
01:51:08,875 --> 01:51:10,666
What's the point of having two arms now?

1216
01:51:12,041 --> 01:51:15,208
This is Kwan,
the three-armed man I told you about.

1217
01:51:15,291 --> 01:51:17,625
He's only got two arms now. Kwan.

1218
01:51:18,208 --> 01:51:19,958
You look so cool with two arms.

1219
01:51:26,083 --> 01:51:27,333
I was a fool, Mom.

1220
01:51:29,541 --> 01:51:31,541
I don't want to be normal.

1221
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,125
I want to be special.

1222
01:51:40,583 --> 01:51:42,166
 I want to be special to someone.

1223
01:53:19,291 --> 01:53:23,291
TRAITHEP BOONSET

1224
01:55:13,708 --> 01:55:14,958
Hello, Kwan.

1225
01:55:16,416 --> 01:55:17,666
How are you?

1226
01:55:17,958 --> 01:55:19,958
You never called me.

1227
01:55:21,250 --> 01:55:23,083
Are you still playing hard to get?

1228
01:55:24,875 --> 01:55:25,916
Look at me.

1229
01:55:26,375 --> 01:55:29,416
I'm a woman, but I wrote to you first.

1230
01:55:31,958 --> 01:55:33,041
Listen.

1231
01:55:33,833 --> 01:55:35,458
I have something to confess.

1232
01:55:37,458 --> 01:55:40,166
I didn't see the TV show that you were on.

1233
01:55:41,916 --> 01:55:44,250
I was very busy that day.

1234
01:55:45,541 --> 01:55:47,541
I was sorting tea leaves all day.

1235
01:55:50,041 --> 01:55:51,541
I shouldn't have missed it.

1236
01:55:54,291 --> 01:55:56,958
I wanted to see what you look like
with two arms.

1237
01:55:59,833 --> 01:56:03,000
I happened to see this photo
in the newspaper.

1238
01:56:04,208 --> 01:56:05,750
I was shocked!

1239
01:56:06,666 --> 01:56:08,666
Did you help the police catch a bad guy?

1240
01:56:10,666 --> 01:56:12,375
You're still playing the hero.

1241
01:56:14,833 --> 01:56:15,958
Kwan.

1242
01:56:16,666 --> 01:56:18,083
Don't worry.

1243
01:56:18,708 --> 01:56:21,541
You look even cooler with two arms.

1244
01:56:24,291 --> 01:56:26,833
When are you going to call me?

1245
01:56:28,166 --> 01:56:30,625
I've changed my ringtone.

1246
01:56:32,916 --> 01:56:34,250
I want to hear it.

1247
01:56:37,416 --> 01:56:38,541
I miss you.

1248
01:56:58,958 --> 01:57:00,208
It's...

1249
01:57:01,708 --> 01:57:03,708
It's probably an experiment

1250
01:57:05,625 --> 01:57:07,625
It's probably a test

1251
01:57:09,833 --> 01:57:11,500
For everyone

1252
01:57:13,708 --> 01:57:15,708
How much

1253
01:57:17,333 --> 01:57:19,583
Love have we got?

1254
01:57:21,166 --> 01:57:23,541
How much faith do we have?

1255
01:57:25,416 --> 01:57:28,041
Is it enough?

1256
01:57:30,041 --> 01:57:33,583
You live your life alone

1257
01:57:33,666 --> 01:57:37,458
And I live my life alone

1258
01:57:37,833 --> 01:57:42,708
We are walking in the emptiness

1259
01:57:45,625 --> 01:57:49,041
We're taking care of our lives alone

1260
01:57:49,625 --> 01:57:53,166
We're fighting just to make it each day

1261
01:57:53,250 --> 01:57:56,000
And one day

1262
01:57:56,083 --> 01:57:59,458
I will need somebody

1263
01:58:01,291 --> 01:58:04,041
Hold my hand

1264
01:58:04,125 --> 01:58:07,916
And together, we can face the world

1265
01:58:08,000 --> 01:58:12,666
With me, you'll never walk alone

1266
01:58:13,041 --> 01:58:15,833
Hold my hand

1267
01:58:15,916 --> 01:58:19,958
No one will feel alone

1268
01:58:20,041 --> 01:58:24,125
And no one

1269
01:58:24,208 --> 01:58:27,125
Will walk alone

1270
01:58:32,375 --> 01:58:34,083
You can rest

1271
01:58:35,375 --> 01:58:37,625
On these shoulders

1272
01:58:39,208 --> 01:58:41,666
I will have everything

1273
01:58:43,541 --> 01:58:45,541
That you want

1274
01:58:48,000 --> 01:58:49,666
This hand

1275
01:58:50,958 --> 01:58:53,666
Will wipe your tears

1276
01:58:55,000 --> 01:58:57,875
Even though things won't return

1277
01:58:59,083 --> 01:59:01,083
To how they were before

1278
01:59:03,750 --> 01:59:07,333
You live your life alone

1279
01:59:07,416 --> 01:59:11,375
And I live my life alone

1280
01:59:11,458 --> 01:59:16,083
We are walking in the emptiness

1281
01:59:18,708 --> 01:59:22,875
We're taking care of our lives alone

1282
01:59:22,958 --> 01:59:26,708
We're fighting just to make it each day

1283
01:59:26,958 --> 01:59:32,791
And one day, I will need somebody

1284
01:59:34,833 --> 01:59:37,833
Hold my hand

1285
01:59:37,916 --> 01:59:41,625
And together we can face the world

1286
01:59:41,958 --> 01:59:45,875
With me, you'll never walk alone

1287
01:59:46,666 --> 01:59:49,208
Hold my hand

1288
01:59:49,291 --> 01:59:53,208
No one will feel alone

1289
01:59:53,458 --> 01:59:57,666
And no one

1290
01:59:57,750 --> 02:00:03,541
Will walk alone

1291
02:00:37,375 --> 02:00:41,041
Hold my hand

1292
02:00:41,125 --> 02:00:44,833
And together we can face the world

1293
02:00:45,083 --> 02:00:49,250
And no one will walk alone

1294
02:00:49,333 --> 02:00:52,708
Hold my hand

1295
02:00:52,791 --> 02:00:56,416
And together, we can face the world

1296
02:00:56,666 --> 02:01:02,625
And no one will walk alone

1297
02:01:12,583 --> 02:01:13,833
It's...

1298
02:01:15,416 --> 02:01:18,083
It's probably an experiment

1299
02:01:19,458 --> 02:01:21,541
It's probably a test

1300
02:01:23,333 --> 02:01:24,916
For everyone

1301
02:04:10,625 --> 02:04:12,625
