steal his dad's disability check

he wasn't gonna let that happen.

127
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:32,429

<i>"Or to watch all night..</i>

154
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,495
"...that no one should wake you.

155
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:49,828
"I remember that three years ago

156
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,997
at threshing time.."

157
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:52,995
Ah..

158
00:07:52,997 --> 00:07:55,094
Excuse me? Sorry, hi.

159
00:07:55,096 --> 00:07:57,462
Uh, would you mind
stopping the work

160
00:07:57,464 --> 00:07:59,194
just for like two more minutes

161
00:07:59,196 --> 00:08:00,363
until I get through this speech?

162
00:08:01,296 --> 00:08:02,363
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

163
00:08:06,963 --> 00:08:09,396
"When I, when I brought you
a glass of water..

164
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,060
"...you were already lying
on the sofa

165
00:08:12,062 --> 00:08:13,396
"and sleeping like a dead man.

166
00:08:15,296 --> 00:08:17,396
<i>"You slept there for half
a day, and all that time</i>

167
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:20,027
<i>"I watched by the door
to make sure</i>

168
00:08:20,029 --> 00:08:21,396
<i>"that no one
should disturb you.</i>

169
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,894
"The more a girl can do,
the greater her love can be.

170
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:29,029
<i>I mean, that is,
the more she feels it."</i>

171
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,094
Okay, I'm done.

172
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,096
<i>Thank you.</i>

173
00:08:36,795 --> 00:08:39,760
I think I was better
when you were working.

174
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:41,461
I got nervous when you stopped.

175
00:08:41,463 --> 00:08:43,296
<i>More, more nervous.</i>

176
00:08:44,096 --> 00:08:45,496
Well, I'll never stop.

177
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:49,227
<i>Alright, listen,
I think we should start</i>

178
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,227
<i>with "Big Cheeseburgers
And Good French Fries"</i>

179
00:08:51,229 --> 00:08:52,893
- "Let Me Ride In Your Big Cadillac."
- No, no, no, no.

180
00:08:52,895 --> 00:08:54,960
And we're doing
a ton of songs in A.

181
00:08:54,962 --> 00:08:57,527
I think we should make sure to revert
every... every third to C or E.

182
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:00,959
Oh, shut up, Zee. He's just gonna
shake 'em and he's gonna roll.

183
00:09:00,961 --> 00:09:03,093
- <i>And my friend had to leave town for.. For 18 years.</i>
- <i>Fuck Townes.</i>

184
00:09:03,095 --> 00:09:04,361
I hooked Blaze up
with this guy Phil.

185
00:09:04,363 --> 00:09:05,793
He's costin'
a shit ton of money

186
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,260
and we only get
two hours tape.

187
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:08,394
We can't have him gettin' drunk

188
00:09:08,396 --> 00:09:11,059
and reading off the back
of tampon packages.

189
00:09:11,061 --> 00:09:12,326
As funny as that is.

190
00:09:12,328 --> 00:09:14,059
His brother owned the rights
to all the..

191
00:09:14,061 --> 00:09:16,360
No, but I mean seriously, if I
ran us off the road right now

192
00:09:16,362 --> 00:09:19,360
and this exploded, none of these
songs would even fucking exist.

193
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:20,860
<i>Just drop me off at Will's.</i>

194
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:22,393
<i>"Drop me off at Will's."
Where the fuck you going?</i>

195
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:24,426
<i>...is only giving Blaze
the gig because of you.</i>

196
00:09:24,428 --> 00:09:26,095
<i>It's like rain.</i>

197
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:29,760
Rain doesn't try and fall.

198
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:32,126
It just falls,
because it's rain.

199
00:09:32,128 --> 00:09:34,360
Okay?
So, it's the same with acting.

200
00:09:34,362 --> 00:09:35,959
- <i>Leave me alone!</i>
- You don't try and act...

201
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:37,526
<i>I don't need your help!</i>

202
00:09:37,528 --> 00:09:39,393
- Ah.
- <i>He's got a gun!</i>

203
00:09:39,395 --> 00:09:40,760
- What?
- <i>He's got a gun!</i>

204
00:09:40,762 --> 00:09:42,493
He's got a gun! Run!
He's got a gun!

205
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:43,759
Fuck me!

206
00:09:46,662 --> 00:09:50,028
He's got a gun, scatter!
Scatter!

207
00:09:53,228 --> 00:09:55,159
<i>Who has a gun?</i>

208
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:59,126
<i>You know that skinny guy
that does the lights?</i>

209
00:09:59,128 --> 00:10:00,894
- <i>Doug?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

210
00:10:04,195 --> 00:10:06,058
He's got a uh..

211
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,058
...14-year-old hayseed girl
up in his room.

212
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,826
So me and some of the guys
went up there

213
00:10:10,828 --> 00:10:12,528
because that didn't sound
very good.

214
00:10:14,094 --> 00:10:16,859
Trying to make sure everything's
on the up and up.

215
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:18,428
Turns out the fucking guy
is nuts.

216
00:10:19,893 --> 00:10:22,060
I guess I should've known.
You know what they say.

217
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:25,092
No, what do they say?

218
00:10:25,094 --> 00:10:27,094
Never stand in the way
of true love.

219
00:10:30,261 --> 00:10:31,960
I'm Sybil by the way.

220
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:34,994
I'm Deputy Dawg.

221
00:10:36,027 --> 00:10:37,392
No, you're not.

222
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:39,192
Deputy Dawg?

223
00:10:39,194 --> 00:10:40,494
You like Blaze better?

224
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:43,459
What's your real name?

225
00:10:43,461 --> 00:10:45,325
It was Mike Fuller, but, uh

226
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:47,994
I ditched that
when I lost 150 pounds.

227
00:10:48,927 --> 00:10:50,826
You lost 150 pounds?

228
00:10:50,828 --> 00:10:52,361
You wanna see my stretch marks?

229
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,192
Is that your best line?

230
00:10:55,194 --> 00:10:57,194
<i>Ah! Nope.</i>

231
00:10:58,694 --> 00:11:02,361
My best line, "Picture cards
can't picture you."

232
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:06,225
How'd you lose all that weight?

233
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:07,227
Thorazine.

234
00:11:11,227 --> 00:11:14,461
Where'd you get that, uh,
that limp from?

235
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:17,425
I had polio.

236
00:11:17,427 --> 00:11:19,192
Oh, no. I'm sorry.

237
00:11:19,194 --> 00:11:20,327
It's okay.

238
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,425
I was only eight months old.

239
00:11:23,427 --> 00:11:25,227
I've been an oddball
ever since.

240
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,057
I never could run or dance

241
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:30,026
or play any of
the reindeer games.

242
00:11:31,261 --> 00:11:32,361
In high school..

243
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,425
...I was the only Jewish person

244
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:38,325
so they used to invite me into
classes for show and tell.

245
00:11:42,926 --> 00:11:44,059
Well..

246
00:11:45,226 --> 00:11:46,826
...odd ducks unite!

247
00:11:58,326 --> 00:12:01,360
I'm shy. I don't know why.

248
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,957
All wild things are shy.

<i>we duct taped
his casket together.</i>

257

- <i>Yeah, we sure did. Didn't we?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

258
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:41,157
<i>Well, he was buried with
everything he owned.</i>

259
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:43,056
Which didn't really
add up to nothing.

260
00:12:43,058 --> 00:12:45,823
- No. A Reagan mask, some pigs!
- But, do you know what?

261
00:12:45,825 --> 00:12:49,725
He, uh..
This was his guitar. Right here.

262

<i>He gave it to you?</i>

263
00:12:50,925 --> 00:12:53,424
I bought it for him.
I bought it for him.

264
00:12:53,426 --> 00:12:55,058
- You did?
- Yeah.

265
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,257
You see, Blaze he... he, uh..

266
00:12:58,259 --> 00:13:01,491
...he was really popular
at the pawn shop.

267
00:13:01,493 --> 00:13:03,058
Almost famous
at the pawn shop.

268
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,390
He, he ended up
borrowing more guitars

269
00:13:06,392 --> 00:13:08,158
than he ever actually played.

270
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:10,923
<i>After the funeral I heard</i>

271
00:13:10,925 --> 00:13:13,190
<i>that it might be
at this one shop</i>

272
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,956
- <i>The guitar?</i>
- <i>This guitar.</i>

273
00:13:14,958 --> 00:13:17,490
<i>So I went over there
and sure enough, there it was.</i>

274
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,390
<i>And, uh..
But, you know..</i>

275
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:23,090
<i>I told the guy, I said, "Hey, man,
that's... that's my buddy's guitar."</i>

276
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:26,590
And you know he gave it to me. He
actually willed it to me. Which he did!

277
00:13:26,592 --> 00:13:28,290
<i>But he wasn't giving away
nothing.</i>

278
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:30,490
<i>He wanted 1800 bucks for it.</i>

279
00:13:30,492 --> 00:13:35,056
<i>So we all knew
that Blaze only had one coat</i>

280
00:13:35,058 --> 00:13:38,990
and I was pretty sure that that
pawn slip was gonna be in that coat.

281
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:41,390
So, one night after the funeral

282
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:43,956
we got thinking about it and, uh

283
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,223
drinking about it
maybe a little bit

284
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,290
and me and Al Minus and, uh..

285
00:13:48,292 --> 00:13:51,156
Crazy Kerkin you know,
some, I'm not really sure.

286
00:13:51,158 --> 00:13:52,755
When was this?

287
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:55,022
You weren't there, but..

288
00:13:55,024 --> 00:13:57,123
I just pretty much decided
I was gonna go over there

289
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,357
and I was gonna dig him up

290
00:13:58,359 --> 00:14:00,425
to get, to get that pawn slip.

291
00:14:02,057 --> 00:14:03,755
<i>And that's what I did.</i>

292
00:14:03,757 --> 00:14:05,955
<i>I went over there
and I dug him up</i>

293
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:07,357
<i>cut through that duct tape</i>

294
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,888
<i>opened it up</i>

295
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:10,257
<i>and sure enough, there it was.</i>

296
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:11,624
<i>Right there
in that breast pocket.</i>

297
00:14:14,091 --> 00:14:15,325
His pawn slip.

298
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:18,224
I'll tell you something else
about that.

299
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:21,389
When I got it open

300
00:14:21,391 --> 00:14:22,824
he was grinnin'.

301
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:26,024
Like laughin'.

302
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:28,790
So now it's my guitar.

303
00:14:32,358 --> 00:14:34,456
<i>Only one drink, big dog.
That's the limit.</i>

304
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:36,356
<i>I don't want any shenanigans
from you tonight.</i>

305
00:14:36,358 --> 00:14:38,222
<i>No fights.
No belligerent bullshit.</i>

306
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:39,589
- <i>No, no, he's...</i>
- <i>You got it?</i>

307

<i>It's none for him.
He's sober. Give his to Concho.</i>

308
00:14:41,824 --> 00:14:42,955
<i>Damn right!</i>

309
00:14:42,957 --> 00:14:46,055
- <i>Blaze sober? Bullshit.</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

310
00:14:46,057 --> 00:14:47,522
<i>He's clean as a the house too.</i>

311
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,855
- Where's Townes?
- Oh, he's, uh, he had to make a stop.

312
00:14:49,857 --> 00:14:52,356
- He's right behind us. He's coming.
- Uh-huh.

313
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:55,157
I'm breaking so many promise to
myself letting you play again.

314
00:14:56,258 --> 00:14:58,821
Don't make me regret it.

315
00:14:58,823 --> 00:14:59,823
Fuck!

316
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:02,955
What an asshole.

317
00:15:02,957 --> 00:15:05,022
- Hmm.
- You good?

318
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:08,055
Sneak me a Dr. Pepper
and a squirt of amber in it.

319
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:10,291
Nah. You got this.
You got this.

322
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:27,988
<i>Okay, good people.</i>

326
00:15:36,956 --> 00:15:40,456
<i>Johnny Carsonin'

327
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:45,421
<i>just gonna play every song I,
I can think of I guess.</i>

328
00:15:45,423 --> 00:15:49,121
Will that mean we're gonna be
on the album if I shout a ton?

329
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:51,054
<i>Yes, I suppose it does!</i>

330
00:15:51,056 --> 00:15:53,288
Hey, Jake, we're
gonna be on the album!

331
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,821
Welcome home!

332
00:15:54,823 --> 00:15:56,188
<i>Fuck you!</i>

333
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,887
Hey! When's Townes comin'?

334
00:15:58,889 --> 00:16:00,223
He's comin' when he's coming.

335
00:16:01,956 --> 00:16:04,954
Spring bird.
You know spring bird!

336
00:16:04,956 --> 00:16:08,221
Springers! You've got to know
some springers.

337
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:11,488
Ever feel like you're not
gonna be alive much longer?

338
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,255
<i>Ha! With the way you live,
that's not much of a premonition.</i>

339
00:16:15,257 --> 00:16:16,755
That's wishful thinkin'.

340
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,954
<i>Well..</i>

341
00:16:19,956 --> 00:16:22,488
<i>...if I was to go up
and see the Big Spender</i>

342
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,388
<i>That's what I call the man
upstairs, The Big Spender.</i>

343
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:30,088
<i>'Cause he, or she,
is one generous being.</i>

344
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:32,886
<i>You want a light? Zap!</i>

345
00:16:32,888 --> 00:16:34,455
<i>Here's a star on fire.</i>

346
00:16:34,457 --> 00:16:35,853
<i>You like flowers?</i>

347

<i>Here's ten million

348
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,987
<i>You want music?
Here's Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart!</i>

349
00:16:40,989 --> 00:16:44,153
<i>You don't dig on the fancy
pants symphonic stuff?</i>

350
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:45,488
<i>Here's Merle Haggard.</i>

351
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:48,120
<i>Yeah, I suppose
if I was to check out early</i>

352
00:16:48,122 --> 00:16:49,621
<i>and go and meet the Big Spender</i>

353
00:16:49,623 --> 00:16:51,920
<i>I'd be sad I never got to meet
Merle Haggard</i>

354
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:54,820
<i>never got to play
my charm song.</i>

355
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:57,455
<i>So, ladies and gentleman's</i>

356
00:16:57,457 --> 00:17:00,387
<i>this deal tonight,
is my letter to Merle.</i>

357
00:17:00,389 --> 00:17:02,053
<i>Say hi to Merle, folks.</i>

358
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:05,153
- Hey, Merle!
- Howdy, Merle!

359
00:17:05,155 --> 00:17:07,155
- Hey, Merle.
- Hey, Merle.

360
00:17:08,822 --> 00:17:11,354
You know, I bet
old Merle's been in love.

361
00:17:11,356 --> 00:17:13,220
Well, I's been in love too.

362
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:16,289
This one's called "Picture Cards
Can't Picture You."

00:17:17,356 --> 00:17:18,688
<i>Ain't that right?</i>

364
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:22,220
You see it's not

365
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:23,555
It's got, you know..

366
00:17:24,289 --> 00:17:26,153
...running water.

367
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:29,187
<i>Man, we sure do appreciate
the offer.</i>

368
00:17:29,189 --> 00:17:30,987
<i>You know, y'all can rent it
if you like.</i>

369
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:32,089
<i>How much you want for it?</i>

370
00:17:32,821 --> 00:17:33,821
Nothin'.

371
00:17:35,488 --> 00:17:37,320

Huh?

I don't wanna be a star.

400
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:41,417
I wants to be a legend.

401
00:19:43,486 --> 00:19:45,319
What's the,
what's the difference, deputy?

402

Legend lasts forever.

407
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:02,953
A legend stands for something.

408
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:05,920
Something that matters,
you know?

409
00:20:08,486 --> 00:20:09,917
Well, do you think
that's possible?

410
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,486
You... you could live forever?

411
00:20:13,353 --> 00:20:16,519
People can't, but a song can.

412
00:20:17,486 --> 00:20:18,952
It's just a matter of time.

413
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:46,019
All of a sudden
I have no idea what to sing.

414
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:48,752
<i>You know any Neil Young?</i>

<i>When is Townes comin'?</i>

416
00:20:52,086 --> 00:20:54,318
<i>Why don't you play the first
song you ever wrote?</i>

417
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:56,986
The first song I ever wrote?

418
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:04,250
Man, I wouldn't play that song
to myself sitting in the dark.

419
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:07,919
Stupid little song about living
in a tree house in the woods.

420
00:21:09,485 --> 00:21:12,250
I wrote that song for a..

421
00:21:12,252 --> 00:21:15,352
...a beautiful little Jewish gal
with kinky hair.

422
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:18,919
Thought that song
would last forever.

423
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:38,150
Just like every time,
I'm... preparing a scene

424
00:21:38,152 --> 00:21:43,018
it's like... I have all
these ideas of how I wanna do it

425
00:21:44,118 --> 00:21:46,316
and then..

426
00:21:46,318 --> 00:21:47,882
...when I actually have to do it

427
00:21:47,884 --> 00:21:50,051
or if there's somebody
watching me..

428
00:21:51,318 --> 00:21:53,452
...it's not even like stage
fright, it's just like..

429
00:21:56,818 --> 00:22:00,085
...the ease of it
kinda leaves my body. You know?

430
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:03,215
- And..
- <i>Mm.</i>

431
00:22:03,217 --> 00:22:04,516
After every time, it's like

432
00:22:04,518 --> 00:22:06,485
it's never as good
as I know it can be.

433
00:22:09,884 --> 00:22:12,782
I don't know, I guess it's just,
like, confidence or something

434
00:22:12,784 --> 00:22:16,515
I just don't feel like I'm giving
it all the energy I actually have.

435
00:22:16,517 --> 00:22:19,415
I wanted to be, like, free and
not questioning what I'm doing

436
00:22:19,417 --> 00:22:21,382
but I'm always questioning it.

437
00:22:21,384 --> 00:22:23,284
Where do you think
confidence comes from?

438
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:27,484
<i>I don't know.
Thinking you're the best?</i>

439
00:22:29,517 --> 00:22:31,184
That's not real confidence.

440
00:22:32,484 --> 00:22:34,384
Can I tell you
where I think it comes from?

441
00:22:35,085 --> 00:22:36,184
<i>Mm-hm, okay.</i>

442
00:22:37,384 --> 00:22:39,983
I think confidence
is a consolation prize

443
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:41,484
for knowing that you're alive.

444
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:45,985
I do.

445
00:22:47,817 --> 00:22:50,182
Some years back,
you weren't even here.

446
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:52,015
And now you're here.

447
00:22:52,017 --> 00:22:54,118
- <i>Mm.</i>
- Couple years, you won't be here again.

448
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,783
<i>Knowin' that you're here's...
kind of a rarity as a human being.</i>

449
00:23:04,017 --> 00:23:07,017
It seems too simple
but it's true I think.

450
00:23:08,351 --> 00:23:09,815
Next time you're on stage

451
00:23:09,817 --> 00:23:14,048
remember, you got a heart
beatin' in your chest..

452
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:16,050
...there's lungs filling up
with air.

453
00:23:18,084 --> 00:23:19,850
All that stuff is really
happenin'.

454
00:23:22,950 --> 00:23:27,214
<i>All these little melodramas
people make up for themself</i>

455
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:28,984
<i>they don't mean anything.</i>

456
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,850
<i>I think that's the way it is.</i>

457
00:23:34,084 --> 00:23:36,248
You have it though.
I've seen it.

458
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:37,381
<i>Yeah, as long
as you're around.</i>

459
00:23:37,383 --> 00:23:38,783
That's not true.

460
00:23:40,316 --> 00:23:42,783
You have it when you're walking
across the room.

461
00:23:44,984 --> 00:23:47,314
And you fill other people
with it

462
00:23:47,316 --> 00:23:49,316
because you remind them
that they're alive.

463
00:23:52,516 --> 00:23:54,481
Bet you didn't know that?

464
00:23:54,483 --> 00:23:55,483
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

465
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:58,350
Well, now you do.

466
00:24:00,017 --> 00:24:01,481
Now, please discard.

467
00:24:01,483 --> 00:24:02,816
I'm ready, there!

468
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:05,348
Can I take another one?

469
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,448
- <i>No!</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

470
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,015
<i>It's my turn!</i>

471
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:10,483

...at, uh..

474
00:24:18,183 --> 00:24:19,381
It was The Outhouse.

475
00:24:19,383 --> 00:24:21,448
Is Townes coming or not?

476
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:23,847
Maintain Jennifer, he's comin'.

477
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:25,046
<i>Yo!</i>

478
00:24:25,048 --> 00:24:27,348
I often find myself thinking on

479
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:29,481
where does a song come from?

480
00:24:29,483 --> 00:24:31,381
A real song.
You know what I mean?

481
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:33,213
He's told me not to come here.

just sort of arrive on time.</i>

484
00:24:40,382 --> 00:24:43,280

But he was a spiritual,
almost righteous.

596
00:32:19,176 --> 00:32:22,140
I guess you could say
he took a vow of poverty

597
00:32:22,142 --> 00:32:24,140
and saw everything
through that lens.

598
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:27,241
You know, I used to fish
the White River with my father.

One spring I was

601
00:32:30,243 --> 00:32:32,873
fishin' with him and I said,
"Daddy, is this the same water

602
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,040
we was ridin' on last summer?"

603

604
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,807

I told you I was gonna pick some
shit up for Jim! I gotta drop it off!

606
00:32:43,343 --> 00:32:45,207
He just shook his head

607
00:32:45,209 --> 00:32:49,040
looked at me,
with some bait on his hook.

608
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:52,274
'Cause I put 20 bucks in the damn
drawer is how you can order it!

609
00:32:52,276 --> 00:32:54,441
That's when I realized
grown folk don't know shit.

610
00:32:54,443 --> 00:32:56,074

And nobody knows nothin'.

612
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,174
Least of all
this goofy son of a bitch.

613
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:02,241
Is he talking to me?

614
00:33:02,243 --> 00:33:03,243
Heh, probably.

615
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,274
Yeah! I'm talking to you!

616
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:10,006
I can hear every goddamn words
you're saying on that talk bus.

617
00:33:10,008 --> 00:33:13,739
How many quarters do you plan
on jamming in, Igmitus?

618
00:33:13,741 --> 00:33:16,274
<i>Hey, man, I'm just waiting
for your shit music to stop.</i>

619
00:33:16,276 --> 00:33:17,872
<i>Ah, ignore this fucker, man.</i>

620
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:19,174
Shit music.

621
00:33:19,176 --> 00:33:21,073
Honey, I might have
to call you back.

622
00:33:21,075 --> 00:33:22,640
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Blaze.</i>

623
00:33:22,642 --> 00:33:23,973
Oh, no, no, no, no.

624
00:33:23,975 --> 00:33:26,075
Why don't you bring your ass up
here, ZZ Top?

625
00:33:27,443 --> 00:33:28,806
Blaze, come on.

626
00:33:28,808 --> 00:33:30,073
Fucking piece of shit.

627
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,874
<i>One time we'd been up
for like a week..</i>

628
00:33:32,874 --> 00:33:34,407
...writing.

629
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:36,872
<i>I was finally trying
to fall asleep.</i>

630
00:33:36,874 --> 00:33:38,573
<i>Blaze just stumbles
into the room</i>

631
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:40,741
and he's, like,
mumbling something.

632
00:33:41,941 --> 00:33:44,939
He, he told me
he was trying to meditate.

633
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:46,106
<i>What?</i>

634
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,806
Yeah.

635
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:49,108
He, he just kept..

636
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:53,505
...saying this, like, Buddhist
prayer over and over again

637
00:33:53,507 --> 00:33:56,073
he was just like,
staring at the wall

638
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:57,173
What, like a mantra?

639
00:33:57,175 --> 00:33:59,039
But then all of a sudden
there was this..

640
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,106
...explosion in the room.

641
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:05,939
Like the room exploded
with this bright white light

642
00:34:05,941 --> 00:34:10,505
and it felt like
something, like..

643
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,039
It was like somethin'
that hasn't made it

644
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:15,440
its way into a book.

645
00:34:15,442 --> 00:34:19,805
<i>And from this feeling
of genuine love</i>

646
00:34:19,807 --> 00:34:23,242
this Buddha-like
character appeared.

647
00:34:25,507 --> 00:34:29,340
And he went to the door
and he opened the door

648
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:33,771
and there was even a bigger
explosion of light

649
00:34:33,773 --> 00:34:35,773
and in walks Jesus.

650
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:39,072
<i>And Jesus tells Blaze</i>

651
00:34:39,074 --> 00:34:41,771
that you never turn your back
on your family.

652
00:34:41,773 --> 00:34:43,905
Did he say it that in Aramaic?

653
00:34:43,907 --> 00:34:45,740
Yeah, something like that.

654
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,005
Regardless of what you worship

655
00:34:48,007 --> 00:34:49,274
or how you worship..

656
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,372
...you can't..

657
00:34:54,374 --> 00:34:56,307
You can't lose,
you can't strip away these

658
00:34:57,474 --> 00:34:59,339
these symbols
that you're raised with.

659
00:34:59,341 --> 00:35:01,274
They become part of you like..

660
00:35:04,074 --> 00:35:05,471
...like blood.

661
00:35:05,473 --> 00:35:08,074
<i>Hell fucking no.</i>

662
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,272
No, no, no, no, no.
Hell fucking no.

663
00:35:13,274 --> 00:35:15,972
Here's what I'm saying is
Blaze didn't have to look east

664
00:35:15,974 --> 00:35:16,974
to see the light.

665
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,805
The light is with us.

666
00:35:21,807 --> 00:35:23,205
I think the two of you
were drinking

667
00:35:23,207 --> 00:35:26,471
or something for a week,
and if I remember correctly

668
00:35:26,473 --> 00:35:28,837
<i>you had to pull a pistol on him
to get him out of your bedroom.</i>

669
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,107
What I'm saying is
that, uh, he was, um..

670
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,107
He was open
to that kind of experience.

671
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:41,904
That doesn't mean
that I think he could handle it.

672
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:44,971
Goddammit, why'd you take your hands
down to the goddamn hole in the wall.

673
00:35:44,973 --> 00:35:46,339
Because they won't let you in.

674
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:48,804
I let you in and you come in
you asked me to come in

675
00:35:48,806 --> 00:35:50,770
and goddammit
I let you in and you fuck it up!

676
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:52,071
- I'm real sorry about that.
- <i>I'm gonna tear your ass down..</i>

677
00:35:55,106 --> 00:35:57,937
Look, I care for the man.
I care for him.

678
00:35:57,939 --> 00:35:59,104
Six... six hundred.

679
00:35:59,106 --> 00:36:00,737
Let's just, let us finish this.
Now, come on.

680
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:03,371
I'm just sick and fucking tired
of people getting hurt in my bar.

681
00:36:03,373 --> 00:36:05,171
- Don't you understand?
- Oh, come on.

682
00:36:05,173 --> 00:36:06,971
- It's over.
- Please?

683
00:36:06,973 --> 00:36:09,506
Goddammit. Son of a mother
fucking bitch.

684
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:12,806
That was embarrassing.

685
00:36:14,939 --> 00:36:15,937
You alright?

686
00:36:15,939 --> 00:36:17,173
I think so.

687
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:20,870
Okey-dokey, smoky-pokey.

688
00:36:20,872 --> 00:36:23,304
This next song
is my wedding song.

689
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:27,570
If J.T.'s alright with it and
they're still not too mad at me

690
00:36:27,572 --> 00:36:30,503
<i>I'd love to have the Outhouse family
come up here and play some music with us.</i>

691
00:36:30,505 --> 00:36:34,870
Jodie, Nassie and Dave.
If y'all feel inclined.

692
00:36:34,872 --> 00:36:37,337
Come on up here
and play this song.

693
00:36:37,339 --> 00:36:40,073
<i>This song's called "Big
Cheeseburgers And Good French Fries."</i>

694
00:36:41,771 --> 00:36:45,370
<i>It's not like playing up a tree
house free as a squirrel.</i>

695
00:36:45,372 --> 00:36:48,039
<i>But looky here now, I'm just
standing here playing for Merle.</i>

696
00:36:49,139 --> 00:36:50,937
That rhyme to.

697
00:36:50,939 --> 00:36:53,503
There's a little sucker thing
going round and around.

698
00:37:03,005 --> 00:37:04,271
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Hey!

699
00:37:04,273 --> 00:37:07,070
- How you been?
- I'm doing good.

700
00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:09,803
Well aren't you the cutest
fucking thing I've ever seen?

701
00:37:09,805 --> 00:37:12,270
<i>You feel confident that they're prepared
to have a Bigfoot in their house?</i>

702
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:14,370
- There's nothing to worry about.
- <i>Sam!</i>

703
00:37:14,372 --> 00:37:16,170
- <i>Sam, come on. They're here! She's here!</i>
- <i>Let's go, let's go.</i>

704
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:28,070
Thanks for the tea,
uh, Mrs. Rosen.

705
00:37:28,072 --> 00:37:30,470
I wish I could
still drink coffee.

706
00:37:30,472 --> 00:37:32,369
Coffee does wonders
for my noodle hub

707
00:37:32,371 --> 00:37:35,070
but wreaks havoc
down in my spaghetti house.

708
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:37,304
It's just a mess, you know?

709
00:37:40,205 --> 00:37:43,936
<i>Blaze, don't you think Sybil
has a nice nose?</i>

710
00:37:43,938 --> 00:37:47,504
Oh, Ms. Rosen, we Pentecostals
don't go in for noses.

711
00:37:52,005 --> 00:37:57,038
Having said that, as far as noses go,
that's one of the finest noses I knows.

712
00:38:02,404 --> 00:38:04,768
So you guys been married
for a long time?

713
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:06,205
Oh, we've been married forever.

714
00:38:08,138 --> 00:38:11,336
<i>Y'all's got that
old-fashioned love.</i>

715
00:38:11,338 --> 00:38:13,138
That's what I want for Tsibila.

716
00:38:14,172 --> 00:38:18,236
Setsibila? What is Setsibila?

717
00:38:18,238 --> 00:38:23,202
Tsi... Tsibila. It means
a little onion in Yiddish.

718
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:27,170
Little onion. So youse my little
sweet Vidalia Onion?

719
00:38:27,172 --> 00:38:29,504
Gonna eat you for breakfast
with my hot potato.

720
00:38:30,837 --> 00:38:32,302
Are you kidding me?

721
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:33,471
Ugh, Mom!

722
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:39,404
Sorry.

723
00:38:42,937 --> 00:38:45,102
Can, uh..

724
00:38:45,104 --> 00:38:48,737
...can we talk to one
another... honestly?

725
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,203
Yeah. That would be nice.

726
00:38:53,403 --> 00:38:55,935
Sybil..

727
00:38:55,937 --> 00:39:01,368
...I think you brought this man
home to meet your family

728
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:05,902
because... you are in love
with him

729
00:39:05,904 --> 00:39:09,768
<i>and you are considering
marriage and children.</i>

730
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,870
<i>Is that right?</i>

731
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,170
Yeah.

732
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:18,401
We are a Jewish family.

733
00:39:18,403 --> 00:39:20,002
<i>Yes.</i>

734
00:39:20,004 --> 00:39:23,803
If we have grandchildren,
we would want them to be Jewish.

735
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:28,803
- I got it.
- I noticed you haven't asked for Sybil's hand.

736
00:39:30,136 --> 00:39:31,936
Is that somethin' you were
planning on doing?

737
00:39:36,104 --> 00:39:39,134
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

738
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:41,867
Well, now would be a great time
for that I think.

739
00:39:41,869 --> 00:39:42,901
- <i>Now?</i>
- <i>Dad.</i>

740
00:39:42,903 --> 00:39:44,034
Jeanette?

741
00:39:44,036 --> 00:39:45,901
Could you come on
back in here, please?

742
00:39:45,903 --> 00:39:47,801
No, no, Dad, Dad.

743
00:39:47,803 --> 00:39:50,169
Please. Let's not be ridiculous,
okay?

744
00:39:51,337 --> 00:39:55,200
If Blaze wants to marry me

745
00:39:55,202 --> 00:39:56,803
we have to talk about it first.

746
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:00,435
Of course
I respect the past, but..

747
00:40:00,437 --> 00:40:03,400
...the past has a lot
of ugliness to it

748
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:07,200
that I think we're all trying
to change in the future.

749
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:09,934
I don't want to spend my life
cleaning up some man's socks

750
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:11,267
and I definitely don't want
to be handed out

751
00:40:11,269 --> 00:40:12,936
as if I am something
that's owned.

752
00:40:28,436 --> 00:40:32,903
If Blaze wants my hand,
he has to ask me.

753
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:40,236
And if I say yes, then,
we will ask for your blessing.

754
00:40:44,202 --> 00:40:46,933
And if you don't give it to us,
we'll do it anyway.

755
00:40:46,935 --> 00:40:52,033
But if Blaze does decide
to convert to Judaism

756
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:54,967
your mother and I, and we
haven't discussed this

757
00:40:54,969 --> 00:40:58,334
but I'm certain we agree

758
00:40:58,336 --> 00:41:02,066
if he does convert, your mother
and I will cover the costs.

759
00:41:02,068 --> 00:41:03,302
Of course, we will.

760
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:08,269
That's good to know.
That's good to know for sure.

761
00:41:09,369 --> 00:41:12,201
Blaze, is your faith important
to you?

762
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:15,168
Is my faith important to me?

763
00:41:17,436 --> 00:41:19,467
I'm not dead positive
I know what you mean..

764
00:41:19,469 --> 00:41:22,299
Your identity as a Christian

765
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:24,969
is that fundamental
to your integrity?

766
00:41:25,802 --> 00:41:27,967
I got ya.

767
00:41:27,969 --> 00:41:31,800
Mr. Rosen, Christianity didn't
do much more than kick my ass

768

770
00:41:37,134 --> 00:41:40,466
the Lord giveth
and the Lord taketh away, so...

771
00:41:40,468 --> 00:41:44,099
No, not terribly important.
That would be a <i>nay.</i>

772
00:41:44,101 --> 00:41:46,802
Well, see, that's
very helpful for me to know.

773
00:41:48,201 --> 00:41:49,967
<i>Say, I got a question?</i>

774
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:51,900
Was Zero Mostel really Jewish?

775
00:41:51,902 --> 00:41:53,299
From "Fiddler On The Roof?"

776
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:55,199
Yeah, yeah.

777
00:41:55,201 --> 00:41:57,899
I believe so.

778
00:41:57,901 --> 00:42:00,299
In fact, I think
he was raised orthodox.

779
00:42:00,301 --> 00:42:01,301
Yeah.

780
00:42:02,468 --> 00:42:03,799

00:44:23,066 --> 00:44:24,331
Oh, yeah?

825
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:25,333

831
00:44:41,765 --> 00:44:43,996

you need an audience.

Oh, yeah. I guess you have to.
Keeps us going.

888
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:15,827
I didn't start drinking coffee
until I was a teenager.

889
00:47:15,829 --> 00:47:19,429
My father loved coffee almost
as much as he liked liquor.

890
00:47:19,431 --> 00:47:22,094
<i>One summer, we was painting
the side of the house.</i>

891
00:47:22,096 --> 00:47:23,827
So he had me down on doing
the low bit

892
00:47:23,829 --> 00:47:26,894
he was doing the high bit.
Anyway, he fell on his face.

893
00:47:26,896 --> 00:47:28,596
Broke his jaw in three places.

894
00:47:28,598 --> 00:47:30,894
- Is this a true story?
- This is a true story.

895
00:47:30,896 --> 00:47:33,760
This is a true story.
I was probably nine years old.

896
00:47:33,762 --> 00:47:35,261
And he was in the hospital
for three days

897
00:47:35,263 --> 00:47:37,329
and I went to visit him
on the second day.

898
00:47:37,331 --> 00:47:39,194
He was just... you know

899
00:47:39,196 --> 00:47:43,194
anxious and shaking,
and his jaw was wired shut.

900
00:47:43,196 --> 00:47:44,927
And he was, like, and I said,
"How you doing, Daddy?"

901
00:47:44,929 --> 00:47:46,328
He said "I'm doing alright,
apart from the fact

902
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:47,927
"that I need a drink
and a cup of coffee

903
00:47:47,929 --> 00:47:49,894
"and they won't let me have
liquor inside the hospital.

904
00:47:49,896 --> 00:47:51,394
But they said
I could have coffee."

905
00:47:51,396 --> 00:47:52,827
And I'm waiting
to find out how.

906
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,860
So the nurse came in.

907
00:47:54,862 --> 00:47:56,194
Nurse comes in and says,
"Mr. Fuller

908
00:47:56,196 --> 00:47:57,596
"I really have to apologize
to you

909
00:47:57,598 --> 00:48:00,328
the only way we can do this
is an enema."

910
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:02,827
<i>Oh, no.</i>

911
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:04,927
And he said,
"I don't care what you do

912
00:48:04,929 --> 00:48:07,127
I just want you to get
my coffee."

913
00:48:07,129 --> 00:48:09,794
So I said, "Should I leave?"
He said, "No."

914
00:48:09,796 --> 00:48:13,061
So she came in. She..
And I promise you, it's true..

915
00:48:13,063 --> 00:48:14,793
Turned him on his side.

916
00:48:14,795 --> 00:48:17,061
<i>And he says,
"Son, hold my hand."</i>

917
00:48:17,063 --> 00:48:19,061
I said, "Alright."

918
00:48:19,063 --> 00:48:21,127
I held his hand and he looked

01:05:12,516 --> 01:05:15,514
<i>What you waitin' on, darlin'?</i>

1224
01:05:15,516 --> 01:05:17,447
Um..

1225
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:19,812
Well, I didn't get very far,
it's only one line.

1226
01:05:21,048 --> 01:05:22,881
But I know the ending to it,
so..

1227
01:05:24,449 --> 01:05:27,349
<i>Well, I look forward to reading
it when you get done with it.</i>

1228
01:05:32,014 --> 01:05:33,615
<i>You redecorated.</i>

1229
01:05:42,181 --> 01:05:44,048
You've been gone six weeks.

1230
01:05:47,248 --> 01:05:48,948
<i>Six weeks, two days.</i>

1231
01:05:59,682 --> 01:06:02,081
I feel like a country
western widow.

1232
01:06:03,415 --> 01:06:05,415
There's a song in there
somewhere.

1233
01:06:18,515 --> 01:06:20,515
I got an idea.

1234
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,348
You..

1235
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:30,481
What's that?

1236
01:06:31,415 --> 01:06:34,313
You and me.

1237
01:06:34,315 --> 01:06:36,179
Mmm-hmm.

1238
01:06:36,181 --> 01:06:39,013
We's gonna build
some place new.

1239
01:06:40,381 --> 01:06:42,645
- Didn't we just move here?
- Um-huh.

1240
01:06:42,647 --> 01:06:44,947
I mean,
didn't I just move here?

1241

<i>Had I known

1244
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,744
<i>I would've dressed like

1248

1249

<i>that dropped into
the Mississippi River</i>

1251

<i>and never made it into
anybody's ears.</i>

1252
01:07:08,347 --> 01:07:11,212
<i>Never got saturated out
into the delta, you know?</i>

1253
01:07:11,214 --> 01:07:13,612
<i>And where did they go? Maybe they
ended up in the Gulf of Mexico.</i>

1254

Why?

01:10:22,411 --> 01:10:24,076
You don't know why?

1335
01:10:24,078 --> 01:10:25,908
It's because I love you.

I ask for it. Please.

1343
01:10:51,077 --> 01:10:53,209
I do not want to be lonely
all my life

1344
01:10:53,211 --> 01:10:56,175

<i>Help me with this life

1346
01:10:58,843 --> 01:11:01,609
treacherous and disappointing.

1347
01:11:01,611 --> 01:11:03,108
I've been reading Mr. Kafka

1348
01:11:03,110 --> 01:11:07,108

but it's hard
to want to suffer.

1352
01:11:15,343 --> 01:11:17,641
We all walk around
puffing like peacocks

1353
01:11:17,643 --> 01:11:20,374
as if we made our own
feathers.

1354
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:24,608
Cut us open, so we can see
our ego is an illusion.

1355
01:11:24,610 --> 01:11:27,840
I would very much like to

oatmeal cookies

Okay, that's it,

The next song's called,
"If I Could Only Fly."

1362

But I was a selfish man
when I wrote this song.

1363
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:13,309
I wrote it for a girl,
a woman.

1364

And, uh..

1365

Zephyr Records.

- That's right.
- I'll tell you what..

- Nothing

- He knows Willie's sister.

01:18:17,371 --> 01:18:20,168
Where do I sign?
Show me the dotted line.

1451
01:18:20,170 --> 01:18:23,135

1489
01:20:02,969 --> 01:20:05,234
<i>I couldn't help but think through
the whole recording process</i>

1490
01:20:05,236 --> 01:20:07,401
<i>about the old fable
about the songbird for whom</i>

1491
01:20:07,403 --> 01:20:11,369
which sang the swamp choir.
Are you familiar with that?

1492
01:20:14,002 --> 01:20:16,201
<i>There's this beautiful
songbird</i>

1493
01:20:16,203 --> 01:20:19,167
<i>for whom sang
in this swamp choir.</i>

1494
01:20:19,169 --> 01:20:21,134
<i>He used to rehearse
on this little cypress tree</i>

1495
01:20:21,136 --> 01:20:22,568
<i>and he was up there
rehearsin' one day.</i>

1496
01:20:22,570 --> 01:20:25,234
<i>They had a big swamp recital
coming up.</i>

1497
01:20:25,236 --> 01:20:29,568
He sang a really pretty song and this bullfrog
comes up and starts watching him singing.

1498
01:20:29,570 --> 01:20:34,732
Songbird looked down and said, "Bullfrog,
you liked that song I'm singing?"

1499
01:20:34,734 --> 01:20:37,267
The bullfrog looked up
and said, "Ahhh."

1500
01:20:37,269 --> 01:20:40,033
<i>Songbird said, "Well if
you don't like that song</i>

1501
01:20:40,035 --> 01:20:41,933
<i>I'll sing you
an even better song."</i>

1502
01:20:41,935 --> 01:20:43,334
<i>So he sang another song
and yes indeed</i>

1503
01:20:43,336 --> 01:20:45,367
<i>this song was twice as good
as the first one.</i>

1504
01:20:45,369 --> 01:20:47,799
He finished up the song,
he looked down at the bullfrog

1505
01:20:47,801 --> 01:20:52,401
and he said, "Bullfrog,
what you think about that song?"

1506
01:20:52,403 --> 01:20:56,367
Once again the bullfrog looked
up and he said, "Ahhhh."

1507
01:20:58,101 --> 01:21:02,699
<i>Songbird said, "Damn!
I was singing my best song."</i>

1508
01:21:02,701 --> 01:21:06,333
<i>He took a deep breath and he sang one of the
most beautiful songs the frog had ever heard.</i>

1509
01:21:06,335 --> 01:21:08,832
<i>In fact, it was the most beautiful
song the whole swamp had ever heard.</i>

1510
01:21:08,834 --> 01:21:12,568
<i>It went on and on and at the end
of it this high note was held.</i>

1511
01:21:12,570 --> 01:21:16,502
<i>The songbird stretched his
neck, his gullet up to the sky.</i>

1512
01:21:17,734 --> 01:21:19,734
And he hit that
final crescendo and..

1513
01:21:21,235 --> 01:21:22,667
<i>Heart gave up.</i>

1514
01:21:22,669 --> 01:21:24,999
Songbird fell dead.

1515
01:21:25,001 --> 01:21:26,500
And as he fell

1516
01:21:26,502 --> 01:21:29,933
that bullfrog looked up
and said, 'Ahhh.'

1517
01:21:29,935 --> 01:21:32,200
And swallowed the songbird.

1518
01:21:32,202 --> 01:21:35,832
<i>The bullfrog felt pretty bad about
that, he wandered over to the river.</i>

1519
01:21:35,834 --> 01:21:38,868
<i>And he went to see the band leader,
which was a big old fat raccoon.</i>

1520
01:21:40,767 --> 01:21:46,200
He said, "Hey, man, I'd like to sing 'The
Revival Of The Night' if that's possible?"

1521
01:21:46,202 --> 01:21:49,168
<i>The raccoon looked him up and
down and said, "Bullfrog..</i>

1522
01:21:50,569 --> 01:21:53,366

Hey, can I ask you too?

1565
01:24:36,698 --> 01:24:40,130
Well, would you mind..
Can we do "Miss Carousel?"

Every time I do those solos..

1569

weird Spanish fly or something..

It's a kooky thing, but it
happens to me all the time.

1576

1579
01:25:12,398 --> 01:25:15,496
<i>but then all of a sudden,
way in the back of the hall</i>

1580
01:25:15,498 --> 01:25:19,163
you see this dude
standing back there.

1581
01:25:19,165 --> 01:25:21,030
He's the only guy standing up.

then all of a sudden

1584
01:25:26,165 --> 01:25:28,096
he starts to move
a little bit closer.

1585
01:25:28,098 --> 01:25:31,462
It's just as soon as he gets
right up to the stage, huh?

1586
01:25:31,464 --> 01:25:34,762
So when he starts
to reach

1587

and you know,
playin' a little bit

1676
01:32:10,059 --> 01:32:11,823
<i>But, um, I'm gonna come back
and see you play.</i>

1677
01:32:11,825 --> 01:32:13,056
- Will you?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1678
01:32:13,058 --> 01:32:14,357
I... I got a show tonight, but..

1679
01:32:14,359 --> 01:32:15,591
I'll try for tomorrow.

1680
01:32:15,593 --> 01:32:17,890
Okay, well, um, I'll put you
on the guest list.

<i>Okay.</i>

1682
01:32:18,926 --> 01:32:19,956
And I'm here
for three more nights

1683
01:32:19,958 --> 01:32:22,890
so you can come by every night.

1684
01:32:22,892 --> 01:32:24,624
I'm happy to see you.

1685
01:32:24,626 --> 01:32:27,424
- Me too.
- Thanks for comin'.

1686
01:32:27,426 --> 01:32:29,123
- And good luck tonight.
- Thank you.

1687
01:32:29,125 --> 01:32:30,956
Let me hear
that line one time.

1688
01:32:30,958 --> 01:32:33,223
Asshole!

1689
01:32:33,225 --> 01:32:36,089
A professional actress
right there.

Asshole!

1691
01:32:51,759 --> 01:32:54,723
Why do you suppose
she didn't come to the gig

1692
01:32:54,725 --> 01:32:56,890
but she came to say hello?

1693
01:32:56,892 --> 01:33:00,857
I told her I had a record coming
out w... with Willie Nelson.

1694
01:33:00,859 --> 01:33:02,859
She said "That's great."

1695
01:33:04,192 --> 01:33:07,325
Why the fuck would she not
come out to the gig, man?

1696
01:33:08,125 --> 01:33:10,756
This next number is called

And on, on, on the side note,
it tells her to call, "Son up?"

1701
01:33:26,192 --> 01:33:29,390
Why would she tell me
she was coming and not come?

I keep gettin'
these long postcards

And she keeps saying,
"Blaze Foley, Blaze Foley

Blaze Foley, when you
gonna get a regular job?"

1706
01:33:43,392 --> 01:33:46,955
Why would she tell me
she was coming and not come?

Is that how y'all do business?

1744

You did it, Blaze.

1837

Well, thank you very, very much.

1838
01:39:42,220 --> 01:39:44,251
My name is Cinnamon.

1839
01:39:44,253 --> 01:39:46,318
Like the bun?

1840
01:39:46,320 --> 01:39:48,485
Now, here's to you, big dog.

1841
01:39:48,487 --> 01:39:50,917
You recorded 24 tracks
in two hours.

1842
01:39:50,919 --> 01:39:53,485
- Goddamn.
- You're a goddamn hero.

1843
01:39:53,487 --> 01:39:54,885
- You're a legend.
- Cheers.

1844
01:39:56,718 --> 01:39:59,750
Look here, I'm on the wagon and
my friend's gonna buy me a guitar

1845
01:39:59,752 --> 01:40:03,251
if I stay sober,
so I'm gonna stay sober.

1846
01:40:03,253 --> 01:40:09,351
But you know you're gonna fall off the
wagon some time. So, let's do it tonight.

1847
01:40:09,353 --> 01:40:12,085
Come on. Let's do it in style.

1848
01:40:13,519 --> 01:40:16,217
It'll be fun
and then I will personally

1849
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:19,850
put y'all both back on the wagon
tomorrow morning.

1850

1851
01:40:22,119 --> 01:40:28,017

pharmacological cocaine.

01:40:28,019 --> 01:40:30,019
I think you'll like it.

1853
01:40:30,586 --> 01:40:31,617
Mm-hmm.

1854
01:40:33,085 --> 01:40:37,317
Well, do I call you
Miss Cinnamon or Dr. Buns?

1855
01:40:37,319 --> 01:40:38,350
Doctor.

1856
01:40:39,785 --> 01:40:43,550
Man, it's a shame you weren't
there on his last night.

1857
01:40:43,552 --> 01:40:46,219
H... he... he played
better than ever.

1858
01:40:47,518 --> 01:40:50,883
He was, like,
nervous and scratchy.

1859
01:40:50,885 --> 01:40:55,050
Like some.. Between a dog
and a wolf..

1860
01:40:55,052 --> 01:40:58,749
- You know that expression?
- No. No, I don't. I..

1861
01:40:58,751 --> 01:41:01,284
- No?
- No.

1862
01:41:01,286 --> 01:41:03,882
It's like the night
when it stops

1863
01:41:03,884 --> 01:41:07,884
getting darker and moves towards
to the light?

1864
01:41:09,018 --> 01:41:12,049
That's the way
Blaze played that night.

1865
01:41:12,051 --> 01:41:14,449
Well, it was lucky
he recorded it.

1866
01:41:14,451 --> 01:41:16,049
Lucky he has friends like you.

I got a confession to make.

1935
01:46:07,381 --> 01:46:09,546
I'm not really a doctor.

1936
01:46:09,548 --> 01:46:10,979
Really?

1937
01:46:10,981 --> 01:46:13,179
I mean I said all that stuff
and I think y'all believed me

1938
01:46:13,181 --> 01:46:15,445
and then I just went with it

1939
01:46:15,447 --> 01:46:20,212
and now I'm feelin' bad
about it.

it was a lie.

Oh, honey, that's okay.

- Oh, Dr. Cinnamon Bun.

that I ever need.

- Yeah.

We're gonna write a song

1950
01:46:42,614 --> 01:46:47,078
'cause when I told him
I used to live in a tree house

1951
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:52,012
he said, "Well, you must be
a squirreling motherfucker."

1952
01:46:52,014 --> 01:46:54,244
- Yeah.
- Man, that's up.

01:46:54,246 --> 01:46:56,646

01:46:58,513 --> 01:47:01,478
And a squirrel lady called
Little Onion

1956
01:47:01,480 --> 01:47:04,077
and this cat called the world
has got a .22 squirrel rifle

1957
01:47:04,079 --> 01:47:07,077
and he's gotta aim
to shoot those squirrel legs.

Pick one. It's a magic ring.

I don't know why you did,
but you did.

2011
01:50:40,976 --> 01:50:43,775
You did it with your voice.

2012
01:50:43,777 --> 01:50:45,277
And your eyes.

2013
01:50:47,143 --> 01:50:48,777

2015
01:50:55,076 --> 01:50:56,275

2016
01:50:56,277 --> 01:50:58,443

I wasn't no coffin wise old man.

I've been lookin'

2036
01:52:31,543 --> 01:52:32,741
I'm scared.

2038

I'm scared
of fucking all of it up.

2039
01:52:44,841 --> 01:52:47,706
I feel like we're living
in the Garden of Eden, you know?

2040
01:52:47,708 --> 01:52:49,874
And I feel like
I'm smart enough..

2041
01:52:52,209 --> 01:52:54,309
I'm smart enough
to know that I am.

2042
01:52:55,643 --> 01:52:57,708
But I don't know
if I'm smart enough to stay.

2043

I think I feel
the same way, darlin'.

2044
01:53:05,241 --> 01:53:09,273
Like, maybe I don't know
how to dance

2045
01:53:09,275 --> 01:53:13,173
and I go left when I'm supposed
to go right and I look up
