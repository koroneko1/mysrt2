you treat him like shit

needs to be filled.

And, uh, after careful consideration…
I have decided that, uh…

And I didn't want to leave without, um…

472
00:27:55,916 --> 00:27:58,375
Uh, thank you for the gift
that you brought me.

-I'm sorry.

496
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,208
I'll hang out with a friend
until I have to go to work at the bar.

497
00:29:15,291 --> 00:29:17,291
And, once I'm there,
I'll be cleaning things,

498
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:20,375
and I always, always, always
end up checking Grindr.

499
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:23,750
And I'll connect with a guy.

500
00:29:24,458 --> 00:29:26,541
-And we'll meet up and fuck.
-Come on, come on.

This time I'm sure he's the one."

503
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:36,375
But I'm wrong. I mess it up,
and it all starts over again.

And, now that I've found one,

00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:49,625
well, I don't know
if it's really what I want.

508
00:29:49,708 --> 00:29:52,958
Because I feel nothing.
And because I know him already.

509
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:55,500
Because I don't feel the way
that I do with you.

510
00:29:56,583 --> 00:29:58,916
And I know it doesn't make any sense
for me to say this now,

511
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,791
and I'm sure I already missed my chance.

512

But I couldn't just go to the other end
of the world without telling you.
