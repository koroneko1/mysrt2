- Hello, everyone, and welcome
to six degrees of santa.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.596
It's December first,
which means it's time

00:22.690 --> 00:25.582
To kick off the third
year of our project.

00:25.675 --> 00:27.584
Now, if you're new
to six degrees,

00:27.603 --> 00:29.586
I'm here to give
you some instructions.

00:30.347 --> 00:32.514
First, you want to get
one of our special boxes,

00:32.608 --> 00:35.200
Which has the directions
on the front.

00:35.352 --> 00:38.428
You can order yours for free
using the link below,

00:38.522 --> 00:40.430
Or if you're
in the new york area,

00:40.449 --> 00:43.208
You can pick one up at our shop,
mcnevin paper company.

00:44.545 --> 00:47.546
Next, you want to pick a gift
that's meaningful to you

00:47.697 --> 00:49.965
And can be enjoyed
for a short period of time.

00:51.886 --> 00:54.294
<i> Some people choose books,</i>
<i> or a christmas movie,</i>

00:54.446 --> 00:55.462
<i> Or a game.</i>

00:55.614 --> 00:57.222
<i> For example, a puzzle.</i>

00:58.450 --> 01:01.393
<i> Pack it all up in your special</i>
<i> six degrees box</i>

01:01.620 --> 01:04.396
<i> And then begin your search</i>
<i> for santa #2.</i>

01:05.882 --> 01:07.900
<i> You can choose</i>
<i> a complete stranger,</i>

01:08.477 --> 01:10.069
<i> Or someone in your orbit.</i>

01:11.313 --> 01:13.739
<i> Your neighborhood</i>
<i> crossing guard,</i>

01:13.966 --> 01:17.150
<i>Or the gentleman you always see</i>
<i> reading on the bench.</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:18.744
<i> Pass it off.</i>

01:19.396 --> 01:21.563
<i> Then santa #2</i>
<i> gets to enjoy</i>

01:21.657 --> 01:23.373
<i> The gift for a day or two,</i>

01:25.920 --> 01:27.586
<i> Then repacks it in this box</i>

01:29.331 --> 01:30.839
<i> And gives it to santa #3.</i>

01:33.485 --> 01:36.169
<i> Then santa #3</i>
<i> hands it off...</i>

01:36.322 --> 01:37.846
(violin playing softly)

01:39.174 --> 01:42.326
<i> ...And so on until it reaches</i>
<i> santa #6,</i>

01:42.344 --> 01:43.685
<i> Who gets to keep the gift.</i>

01:45.940 --> 01:48.089
- Thanks, santa! How'd you know?

01:48.183 --> 01:49.333
I love puzzles!

01:49.426 --> 01:50.592
<i> (harper): The spirit</i>
<i> of six degrees</i>

01:50.611 --> 01:52.444
<i> Is to connect to the world.</i>

01:52.671 --> 01:54.171
By santa #6,

01:54.189 --> 01:55.856
Your gift will have made
its way to someone

01:55.950 --> 01:57.190
You could never have imagined.

01:57.343 --> 01:58.867
The process is anonymous.

01:59.695 --> 02:00.935
It's more fun that way!

02:01.029 --> 02:02.621
You're just sharing
a bit of yourself

02:02.848 --> 02:05.106
And leaving the rest up
to christmas magic.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.127
Now, if you have any questions
or comments,

02:08.354 --> 02:11.188
<i> Feel free to email me</i>
<i> at the address below.</i>

02:11.966 --> 02:13.882
<i> Happy gifting</i>
<i> and merry christmas!</i>

02:15.377 --> 02:16.951
What do you think, director?

02:17.045 --> 02:19.363
- I think it's our best yet!

02:19.381 --> 02:22.474
- Well, it's December first,
so six degrees is live!

02:23.385 --> 02:24.226
Hmm!

02:25.312 --> 02:26.127
Did you figure out
what you're doing

02:26.221 --> 02:27.271
For your six degrees gift yet?

02:28.149 --> 02:29.314
- I'm still deciding.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.151
Maybe my jinglemice
christmas record?

02:32.987 --> 02:34.111
- You'll never guess
what I found for mine.

02:36.973 --> 02:39.992
- Whoa! You finally found
another copy!

02:40.219 --> 02:43.069
- Online from a used
book store in wisconsin.

02:43.906 --> 02:45.330
- At least we'll always have
ours from grandpa.

02:45.557 --> 02:46.648
- Mm-hmm.

02:46.742 --> 02:48.892
Remind me, what's your
favourite part again?

02:48.985 --> 02:52.062
- I think it's when elfie
is in new mexico

02:52.080 --> 02:53.988
And she learns about luminarias

02:54.008 --> 02:56.341
And how luminaria
means "light."

02:56.568 --> 02:59.160
- Mm-hmm! Well, that's my
favourite part, too.

02:59.922 --> 03:01.346
And you're my little luminaria.

03:05.411 --> 03:06.351
(gasps)

03:09.523 --> 03:10.838
(shutter clicking)

03:10.933 --> 03:12.507
- Oh!
- Oh!

03:12.601 --> 03:14.267
Good morning, harper. Dani.

03:14.361 --> 03:15.602
I hope it's okay.

03:15.696 --> 03:17.345
I love these for a background.

03:17.439 --> 03:18.864
Very wholesome.

03:19.091 --> 03:21.258
Christmas whimsical.

03:21.351 --> 03:22.701
Ooh, that might be
a good hashtag.

03:22.928 --> 03:24.536
I'm certainly trying
to snag more followers.

03:24.688 --> 03:26.947
Especially with
my new crafty venture.

03:27.041 --> 03:28.448
- Oh, that's awesome!

03:28.542 --> 03:31.435
Hey, you know I slipped
an invite to our small business

03:31.528 --> 03:32.694
Christmas party
into your mailbox.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.104
So, you know, you should come.

03:34.122 --> 03:35.672
- I'll try, if I'm not swamped.

03:37.867 --> 03:40.460
- So, wow was your date
the other night?

03:40.554 --> 03:41.470
- Dates.

03:42.798 --> 03:43.630
Two different apps,
two different boroughs.

03:43.724 --> 03:45.298
5 pm, then 8 pm.

03:45.451 --> 03:47.875
They were both... Okay.

03:47.970 --> 03:51.879
- I have to say, online dating
doesn't sound exactly magical.

03:51.974 --> 03:53.640
- It's the only way, harper.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.883
You just let me know when
you decide to get out there.

03:55.978 --> 03:58.478
I'm happy to do a little
free consulting.

03:58.572 --> 04:02.074
- Good to know, but it's not
exactly a priority right now.

04:03.893 --> 04:05.494
- If you change your mind,
I'm here.

04:06.655 --> 04:08.372
- Take care. Bye, zoey.

04:09.566 --> 04:12.084
Alright, let's get you
to school, huh?

04:12.311 --> 04:13.085
(soft music)

04:22.671 --> 04:24.746
- Good morning,
my darling daughter!

04:24.840 --> 04:26.339
Oh! You just missed harold.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.657
He dropped off another bundle

04:27.676 --> 04:29.083
Of six degree
boxes for you.

04:29.103 --> 04:30.519
- Ooh!

04:33.348 --> 04:34.998
What do you think
of the pattern this year?

04:35.517 --> 04:37.025
- I think it's gorgeous. Oh.

04:37.778 --> 04:38.610
And...

04:39.596 --> 04:41.838
You were mentioned
on ivy b. Holly,

04:41.931 --> 04:43.023
One of my favourite
christmas blogs.

04:43.175 --> 04:44.341
(chuckling)

04:44.359 --> 04:47.027
"here I go,
embarking on my second year

04:47.121 --> 04:48.528
Of six degrees of santa,

04:48.622 --> 04:53.292
A delightful, if mysterious,
gift chain I found online.

04:53.443 --> 04:54.367
Check it out!"

04:54.461 --> 04:56.870
Isn't that what
they call trending?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.204
Huh? I know I've said it before,

04:58.357 --> 05:01.466
But I really feel like you could
go big with this.

05:01.693 --> 05:04.027
- I don't think that counts
as trending, mom.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.363
You know what,
I've said it before,

05:06.456 --> 05:09.215
Small and personal,
you know? Almost renegade!

05:09.368 --> 05:10.458
That's the whole point.

05:10.477 --> 05:14.479
- I don't mean big
like corporate partner.

05:14.631 --> 05:17.223
I'm saying big, like,
get some momentum behind it.

05:17.318 --> 05:18.650
Find a way to get paid for it.

05:19.711 --> 05:22.879
- Why? Are you firing me?

05:22.898 --> 05:25.741
- No, I like having
you around too much.

05:27.143 --> 05:29.903
But your skills
are being underserved.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.407
- What? Working with my mom
in our family company

05:34.560 --> 05:36.918
And getting to spend
more time with my daughter?

05:38.321 --> 05:39.338
I'd say that counts
as fulfilling.

05:40.899 --> 05:41.656
(sighs)

05:41.750 --> 05:45.010
- I suppose I'm also saying,

05:45.237 --> 05:47.471
Who knows how much longer
this will be around.

05:50.092 --> 05:52.425
- Do you mean that in
the philosophical sense or...

05:52.519 --> 05:53.977
Mom, are you worried?

05:55.247 --> 05:56.521
- Your father was...

05:57.841 --> 05:59.358
Better at the business side
of things.

06:01.195 --> 06:02.343
December just started.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.112
It's our busiest time.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.033
We just need a banner
sale season. We'll be okay.

06:08.260 --> 06:09.201
- Okay.

06:10.704 --> 06:14.021
So, what do we need
for a big banner sale season?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.208
- A rush of christmas spirit!

06:16.877 --> 06:17.709
Luck.

06:17.861 --> 06:19.285
(laughing)

06:19.438 --> 06:20.453
Oh, before you settle in,

06:20.606 --> 06:24.132
Can you walk these packages
over to gus?

06:24.776 --> 06:25.884
Please!

06:26.795 --> 06:28.387
- Sure, mom.
- Thank you!

06:28.614 --> 06:29.679
- Mm-hmm!

06:31.040 --> 06:33.116
- Alright, let's hear it,
people, let's hear it.

06:33.209 --> 06:34.976
(applause)

06:36.455 --> 06:37.804
Hi, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.639
Lovely to see you all.

06:39.791 --> 06:42.734
Now, I am beyond thrilled

06:42.961 --> 06:45.645
To bring my tech brand
into the real world

06:45.739 --> 06:49.408
And into your living rooms
on christmas morning with...

06:49.635 --> 06:50.467
Sparkltree!

06:50.560 --> 06:51.827
(applause)

06:53.580 --> 06:54.654
Partnering with farmers,

06:54.748 --> 06:57.064
We have engineered
what we believe to be

06:57.159 --> 06:59.309
The perfect christmas tree.

06:59.327 --> 07:03.755
From branch distribution,
shape, and needle retention,

07:03.982 --> 07:06.425
Right down to that magnificent
conifer scent.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.836
Now, it comes in three sizes,

07:09.930 --> 07:10.820
But most importantly,

07:11.598 --> 07:13.990
It can be delivered
to your front door

07:14.083 --> 07:16.226
With the very simple
click of a button.

07:18.421 --> 07:19.187
Are you ready?

07:21.257 --> 07:22.190
(applause)

07:24.278 --> 07:25.735
- Hey, hal.
- Hey.

07:26.354 --> 07:27.446
- What's all this?

07:27.673 --> 07:30.690
- Oh, it's a christmas tree
you order online.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.692
Apparently it's perfect.

07:32.844 --> 07:35.537
- Ugh! Jason sparks.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.199
Of course he thinks he can
invade and commodify christmas.

07:39.293 --> 07:42.702
- Oh, I'd suppose
you've known him from
your silicon valley days.

07:42.854 --> 07:43.628
- Yeah, I worked for him.

07:44.631 --> 07:45.872
Well, I mean,
for one of his companies.

07:46.024 --> 07:47.466
I... I didn't know him.

07:47.693 --> 07:50.360
He's more of
a looming presence.

07:50.378 --> 07:54.531
- Now just think, no more
laborious trips to the farm,

07:54.624 --> 07:56.549
Having to strap your tree
to the roof of your car,

07:56.643 --> 07:57.458
Scratching the paint.

07:57.552 --> 07:59.052
And if you live in the city,

07:59.146 --> 08:02.797
Imagine not having to haul
your cumbersome christmas trees

08:02.816 --> 08:03.982
Seven city blocks,

08:04.209 --> 08:06.726
Only to have it poke you
and give you splinters,

08:07.713 --> 08:10.489
Sap all over your hands,
needles everywhere.

08:10.716 --> 08:11.973
(chuckling)

08:11.992 --> 08:13.383
- You gotta love
how he pretends

08:13.476 --> 08:14.308
Like he's doing it
for our well-being.

08:14.402 --> 08:17.120
- Eh, he's always
been nice to me.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.998
- You would buy one
of those things?

08:21.076 --> 08:23.150
- Yeah! I mean, look at it.

08:23.245 --> 08:24.894
It's a good-looking tree!

08:24.913 --> 08:26.746
- But what about
your trip to watson's farm

08:26.840 --> 08:28.248
With jeanie and the kids, huh?

08:28.342 --> 08:30.233
And hot cocoa in travel mugs?

08:30.326 --> 08:31.751
- Uh, maybe we could
just stay in,

08:31.845 --> 08:33.160
Watch a christmas carol instead?

08:33.180 --> 08:35.013
- I don't believe it.

08:35.164 --> 08:36.573
To be continued!

08:36.591 --> 08:37.590
- Alright. Have a good one.

08:37.743 --> 08:38.683
(chuckling)

08:39.427 --> 08:40.977
- Right to your front door.

08:41.838 --> 08:43.096
(applause)

08:43.190 --> 08:45.749
Thank you so much.

08:45.842 --> 08:47.433
Thank you.

08:47.528 --> 08:48.693
(bright holiday music)

08:56.928 --> 08:57.786
(sighs)

09:02.859 --> 09:04.042
Are you going
to get a sparkltree?

09:06.713 --> 09:07.546
- No.

09:10.700 --> 09:13.126
- Oh. You don't celebrate
christmas. I'm so sorry,

09:13.278 --> 09:14.201
I shouldn't assume.

09:14.296 --> 09:16.212
- Oh, no, no.
I celebrate christmas.

09:16.723 --> 09:18.873
I adore christmas.

09:18.967 --> 09:21.560
But I also adore
real christmas trees.

09:22.971 --> 09:25.471
- Sparkltrees are real
christmas trees.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.882
- Also, personally, you know,
I enjoy carrying my tree

09:27.901 --> 09:30.051
Back those seven blocks
from the tree lot.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.903
You know,
a family-owned business,

09:32.130 --> 09:34.239
Something that is practically
disappearing.

09:34.390 --> 09:36.074
And if the tree wants
to poke me with its needles,

09:36.301 --> 09:37.409
Well, I welcome it!

09:39.137 --> 09:39.744
- Sorry, do I know you?

09:40.806 --> 09:42.080
Have I done something
to offend you?

09:42.307 --> 09:44.824
- Why bother growing
living things at all, right?

09:44.918 --> 09:47.327
Why not just skip ahead to,
I don't know,

09:47.479 --> 09:48.753
A christmas tree hologram

09:48.905 --> 09:50.330
That you can decorate
from your tablet?

09:50.424 --> 09:52.239
- That's...
(scoffs)

09:52.334 --> 09:53.341
...Not a bad idea, actually.

09:54.669 --> 09:56.986
That would be
really good for travel. Hmm...

09:57.080 --> 09:58.597
- Okay, why are you trying

09:58.824 --> 10:00.673
To take the heart
and magic out of christmas?

10:00.767 --> 10:01.507
(scoffs)

10:01.602 --> 10:02.416
(elevator dings)

10:02.510 --> 10:03.751
- I think you're making a lot

10:03.845 --> 10:04.769
Of assumptions about this tree.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.164
Tell you what, how about I send
you one, on the house?

10:08.183 --> 10:09.182
You might change your mind.

10:09.334 --> 10:10.500
- I would send it back.

10:10.518 --> 10:11.276
(harper chuckles)

10:11.427 --> 10:12.611
Merry christmas.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.773
(phone ringing)

10:17.284 --> 10:18.766
- Good morning, sir.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.193
- Quick question for you,
elliott.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.102
- Yeah, go ahead. Shoot, boss.

10:21.196 --> 10:22.679
- Do you think the sparkltree

10:22.697 --> 10:25.624
Brand fails
to exude magic and heart?

10:25.775 --> 10:27.608
- Uh, I'd say it piggybacks
off the inherent magic

10:27.628 --> 10:28.442
And heart of the season?

10:28.536 --> 10:29.419
We did have that focus group.

10:32.782 --> 10:36.192
So... This is your
forwarded mail.

10:36.285 --> 10:38.470
I checked for anything
time sensitive.

10:39.956 --> 10:43.975
I also wasn't sure
whether to pass this one along.

10:46.221 --> 10:47.062
(clears throat)

10:50.725 --> 10:52.067
- It looks great.

10:52.878 --> 10:54.310
Happy.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.896
I suppose it was only
a matter of time.

10:57.048 --> 10:59.991
Um, look up their registry
and send them something nice.

11:00.218 --> 11:00.992
- Sure.

11:05.390 --> 11:06.665
(sighs)

11:12.155 --> 11:13.296
(knocking)

11:14.341 --> 11:15.507
(harper): Come in!

11:16.401 --> 11:17.417
Hey, you!

11:17.511 --> 11:18.735
- Hey! Happy December, harper.

11:18.753 --> 11:20.345
- Happy December to you too!

11:21.181 --> 11:23.598
Dani, your dad's here!

11:24.592 --> 11:25.684
And you guys better get moving.

11:25.911 --> 11:26.351
- Yeah.

11:27.521 --> 11:29.245
Hey, I saw six degrees posted.

11:30.248 --> 11:32.932
- Yes! You know, look what
I found for my gift this year.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.083
- Wow!
- Mm-hmm!

11:34.177 --> 11:36.102
- And... You're going
to give it away?

11:36.254 --> 11:38.922
- Well, yeah. I mean, it's the
perfect thing for six degrees.

11:39.015 --> 11:41.441
You know, nobody knows it,
so it's new,

11:41.593 --> 11:42.926
But it's also timeless.

11:42.944 --> 11:44.694
And, you know, it's about
human connection.

11:45.764 --> 11:47.263
It basically inspired
the whole thing.

11:47.356 --> 11:48.540
(chuckles)

11:48.767 --> 11:49.624
(sighs)

11:53.863 --> 11:54.838
What's up?

11:58.460 --> 11:59.968
- Speaking of human connection,

12:02.389 --> 12:03.805
I've met somebody.

12:05.225 --> 12:06.725
And I really feel like
it's going to go somewhere.

12:07.728 --> 12:08.393
Her name's sylvia.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.287
And I wanted to introduce her

12:11.306 --> 12:14.381
To dani but I wanted
to talk to you first.

12:14.476 --> 12:16.151
- I trust your timing
and judgment.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.070
I'm happy for you.

12:20.741 --> 12:21.573
- How about you?

12:22.984 --> 12:24.242
Anything going on
in that department?

12:24.393 --> 12:26.803
(scoffs)
- no. Nope, no.

12:26.896 --> 12:27.987
I'm, uh...

12:28.081 --> 12:30.156
I'm putting all of that
on the back burner--

12:30.250 --> 12:31.398
(dani): Hey, dad!

12:31.418 --> 12:35.086
- Hey, look at you!
(chuckles)

12:35.238 --> 12:36.496
Are we excited
for the nutcracker?

12:36.590 --> 12:37.756
- So excited!

12:39.259 --> 12:40.341
- See, I wonder if he'll beat
the mouse king this year.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.244
- Dad! He always does.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.429
(laughing)
- come on, let's go.

12:44.656 --> 12:45.597
(soft music)

13:17.022 --> 13:17.796
<i> (harper): Dear santas,</i>

13:22.527 --> 13:25.303
<i> This book holds a special</i>
<i> place in my heart.</i>

13:31.627 --> 13:33.386
- I decided to go with
the jingle mice record.

13:33.480 --> 13:34.813
- Oh, that's perfect!

13:34.964 --> 13:36.630
Do you know how many people
are going to be listening

13:36.650 --> 13:37.965
To your favourite
christmas music?

13:38.877 --> 13:40.735
And, uh, do you have
a santa #2 in mind?

13:41.822 --> 13:43.563
- There's this new girl
in my class.

13:43.657 --> 13:45.615
She's really shy. How about you?

13:46.660 --> 13:47.884
- You know, this year,

13:47.902 --> 13:49.735
I think I'm going
to be in the moment,

13:49.830 --> 13:51.162
Go where inspiration takes me!

13:54.150 --> 13:55.458
(birds chirping)

13:58.338 --> 13:59.153
- Good morning, leonard!

13:59.172 --> 14:00.839
- Good morning, you two!

14:01.066 --> 14:02.582
- Oh, it's the start
of your busy season, huh?

14:02.734 --> 14:05.568
- Yes, but I love it.
(chuckles)

14:05.661 --> 14:07.178
It probably sounds
kind of cheesy,

14:07.405 --> 14:09.755
But this time of year,
it feels extra special

14:09.908 --> 14:12.851
To be the person who connects
the people with the packages.

14:13.002 --> 14:14.501
And cards.

14:14.596 --> 14:16.262
It makes me feel
like a v.I.P.

14:16.414 --> 14:18.523
- Mm-hmm!
- Very important postman!

14:18.674 --> 14:19.858
(laughing)

14:20.085 --> 14:21.526
(soft music)

14:29.594 --> 14:30.869
(chuckling)

14:33.522 --> 14:34.664
(exhaling)

14:36.710 --> 14:37.542
- Huh...

14:42.698 --> 14:44.549
Hey, come on,

14:44.776 --> 14:45.550
Let's read the book.

14:46.887 --> 14:47.719
Jump up.

14:47.946 --> 14:49.036
Yeah.

14:49.130 --> 14:50.471
What are these people doing?

14:51.707 --> 14:52.557
Thank you.

14:52.784 --> 14:54.058
And this is for you.

14:55.303 --> 14:58.062
♪ craving to hold your hand ♪

14:58.973 --> 15:01.900
♪ six degrees of love ♪

15:06.481 --> 15:09.032

15:09.984 --> 15:12.243

15:13.896 --> 15:15.914

15:18.309 --> 15:20.168
- This is for mr. Sparks.
He gets to keep it!

15:24.832 --> 15:27.592
- So, christmas
is fast approaching,

15:27.819 --> 15:30.486
But we are pretty much
wrapped on sparkltree.

15:30.505 --> 15:33.765
Um... We deployed the updates
to the companion app.

15:33.992 --> 15:36.325
Music department has added
a few extra playlists.

15:36.344 --> 15:38.603
For example,
"music to open presents to."

15:40.014 --> 15:44.108
And, of course, there's tree
care, wrapping tips, et cetera.

15:44.260 --> 15:46.861
So, uh, we should be all
good to go for your hiatus.

15:49.190 --> 15:50.931
(sighs)
- hiatus...

15:50.951 --> 15:53.192
- Oh, there was this bake sale

15:53.286 --> 15:55.602
Sponsorship for a local high
school basketball team

15:55.697 --> 15:57.196
Coming this Saturday night.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.514
It's really small scale.

15:58.607 --> 16:00.107
I'm not even sure how
the request got through.

16:00.201 --> 16:01.292
Do you just want
me to cancel on that--

16:01.519 --> 16:02.185
- No.

16:02.203 --> 16:03.544
No.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.799
That would go against
the sincere, down-to-earth
vibe we're going for.

16:07.950 --> 16:09.801
No, put fabian on it.
You can coordinate remotely.

16:10.028 --> 16:10.718
- Okay.

16:13.622 --> 16:15.531
Are you sure I should be
heading to vermont tomorrow?

16:15.624 --> 16:16.549
- Enjoy your time
with your family.

16:16.701 --> 16:17.383
I mean, don't forget

16:17.477 --> 16:19.202
To take notes on the authentic

16:19.295 --> 16:21.437
Family christmas
for sparkltree 2.0.

16:23.299 --> 16:25.483
But you haven't spent christmas
with your family in three years.

16:26.894 --> 16:28.945
I feel like it's something
you should do, yeah.

16:32.066 --> 16:33.825
- Uh, is everything okay?

16:35.887 --> 16:36.494
(sighs)

16:36.645 --> 16:38.070
- I think so.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.057
Just that off feeling, you know?

16:41.150 --> 16:44.243
- Mmm. I'm sure
it's your open calendar.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.670
You're not used to it.

16:45.821 --> 16:47.230
I think it's a good thing.

16:47.248 --> 16:49.841
I mean, everyone needs
to take time off at some point.

16:50.068 --> 16:52.135
And christmas is as good
a time as any to...

16:53.680 --> 16:57.849
Reminds me, um, that box over
there is an actual present.

16:58.834 --> 17:00.593
Yeah, hal passed it along,

17:00.745 --> 17:03.855
Said some boy who's a fan
wanted to give it to you.

17:06.251 --> 17:06.858
- Thank you.

17:09.921 --> 17:11.029
(sighs)

17:17.762 --> 17:18.703
(chiming)

17:19.931 --> 17:20.788
(soft music)

17:26.938 --> 17:28.212
(sighs)

17:35.388 --> 17:36.554
(enchanting music)

17:43.955 --> 17:44.729
<i> (harper): Dear santas,</i>

17:46.140 --> 17:48.399
<i>This book holds a special place</i>
<i> in my heart.</i>

17:49.385 --> 17:52.028
<i> My father gave me a copy</i>
<i> when I was a child.</i>

17:53.573 --> 17:57.316
<i> I miss him so much,</i>
<i> especially this time of year.</i>

17:57.410 --> 18:00.745
<i> But the very book he gave me</i>
<i> always reminds me</i>

18:00.972 --> 18:05.750
<i> That there is love and</i>
<i>connection to be had everywher.</i>

18:06.419 --> 18:08.419
<i> Maybe even right</i>
<i> around the corner.</i>

18:09.405 --> 18:11.047
<i> I wish all of this for you.</i>

18:11.925 --> 18:14.675
<i> Yours, ms. Santa #1.</i>

18:16.745 --> 18:18.429
(jason chuckles)

18:22.844 --> 18:23.851
- This very book,

18:25.254 --> 18:27.663
It was like a lifeline for me
when I was young.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.425
My family, they moved constantly
and my uncle got this for me

18:31.519 --> 18:36.197
To remind me that home didn't
necessarily need to be a place.

18:37.842 --> 18:40.284
I lost my copy and I've been
looking for one ever since.

18:40.436 --> 18:41.861
And then it just shows up!

18:42.513 --> 18:44.372
And the note on the inside...

18:45.700 --> 18:49.085
It feels like it was
written by me, or for me.

18:50.630 --> 18:54.690
- So... Are we looking into
a publishing venture or...

18:54.783 --> 18:57.760
- The fact that this found me
at a time where I'm taking
a break to...

18:58.863 --> 18:59.762
(sighs)

19:01.307 --> 19:03.641
...Process how I'm feeling
about my ex getting married.

19:03.792 --> 19:07.386
- So, are we looking
to get back into dating apps?

19:07.538 --> 19:08.629
Cancelling your hiatus?

19:08.723 --> 19:09.814
- This isn't about the company.

19:13.469 --> 19:14.152
All I know is...

19:15.730 --> 19:17.546
When I read this note
in this book,

19:18.232 --> 19:20.491
I felt something
I haven't felt in years.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.161
With all those
coincidences lining up,

19:23.312 --> 19:24.811
I feel like it would
be negligent not to follow

19:24.831 --> 19:26.497
The data,
to see where this leads.

19:28.242 --> 19:31.169
I have to find, to meet...

19:33.489 --> 19:34.505
Ms. Santa #1.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.921
- I just have to say,
a few of us have really been

19:42.015 --> 19:43.181
Rooting for you to get back
out there, sir.

19:44.742 --> 19:47.518
Okay, it looks like
this is the website.

19:49.597 --> 19:52.581
It's like a chain letter,
but with gifting?

19:53.584 --> 19:55.276
- It is pretty clever,
if underdeveloped.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.103
There's gotta be some kind
of social media component

19:58.256 --> 20:00.105
For all these santas
to meet each other.

20:00.683 --> 20:02.950
- Uh, I don't see anything.

20:04.095 --> 20:05.536
Let's watch this video.

20:07.114 --> 20:08.873
<i> - Hello, everyone, and welcome</i>
<i> to six degrees of santa.</i>

20:09.784 --> 20:10.691
<i> It's December first...</i>

20:10.710 --> 20:11.542
- Wait a second.

20:12.119 --> 20:13.269
I've met this woman!

20:13.287 --> 20:15.046
- Yeah, didn't she used
to work for us?

20:16.549 --> 20:18.049
- Wait, what?

20:23.706 --> 20:26.949
- I saw that you put
in for more boxes.

20:26.968 --> 20:28.451
Are you still shipping
those out, free of charge?

20:28.469 --> 20:31.454
- Yeah! You know,
I actually mailed one off

20:31.547 --> 20:34.398
To skagway, alaska
the other day. Yeah!

20:35.960 --> 20:37.718
- That's gotta start
adding up, sweetheart.

20:38.463 --> 20:40.554
- Well, you know,
sometimes people choose

20:40.573 --> 20:43.315
To spend their money going
to aspen for the holidays,

20:43.468 --> 20:44.967
But this is how
I choose to spend mind.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.893
Plus, you know,
it drives foot traffic

20:46.913 --> 20:49.563
To the store, so I think
it's win-win.

20:49.582 --> 20:50.748
- Harper mcnevin.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.167
You used to work for me.

20:54.403 --> 20:56.420
- Hmm, yeah,
have you popped by

20:56.647 --> 20:57.922
For a forgotten
performance review?

20:58.073 --> 20:58.756
(jason chuckles)

21:00.001 --> 21:00.741
- Hi, I'm jason sparks.

21:00.835 --> 21:02.151
- Oh, I know! Hi.

21:02.244 --> 21:04.169
I'm pauline, harper's mother.

21:05.156 --> 21:07.098
- This is elliott,
my executive assistant.

21:08.676 --> 21:10.342
I looked into it.

21:10.436 --> 21:13.329
You were one of our most
promising programmers.

21:13.347 --> 21:16.515
You designed sugar share,
charming neighborhood
sharing app.

21:16.667 --> 21:20.019
- Yeah, which your vp
of business development
squelched

21:20.113 --> 21:22.613
Because it didn't have enough
profit potential.

21:22.765 --> 21:24.598
- Yeah, that happens.

21:24.692 --> 21:25.700
- Why are you here?

21:26.935 --> 21:29.011
Uh... And how did you find me?

21:29.104 --> 21:30.346
- Well, as a matter of fact,

21:30.439 --> 21:34.533
I am a santa #6 in
your six degrees of santa chain.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.520
Your video indicated
I might find you here,

21:37.613 --> 21:41.257
And well, I was hoping
you could help me locate
my original santa.

21:42.117 --> 21:43.384
This is the gift I received.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.787
- Would you look at that!
That's--

21:46.881 --> 21:48.213
- A book. Yeah, mom.

21:48.366 --> 21:50.308
It's a book that I've never
seen before in my life.

21:51.811 --> 21:55.313
So why do you have to find
this original santa?

21:56.374 --> 21:59.233
- Well, it's important to me.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.988
This book was a childhood
favourite of mine.

22:05.474 --> 22:07.992
That, along with the note
written on the inside the cover,

22:08.828 --> 22:09.810
Well, it made me think

22:09.829 --> 22:12.747
That we might possibly
share a...

22:13.833 --> 22:14.665
A connection.

22:15.576 --> 22:16.817
- You mean like romantically?

22:16.911 --> 22:18.894
- Possibly. Maybe.

22:19.988 --> 22:22.231
Listen, I got a gut-feeling
and I simply can't ignore it.

22:22.324 --> 22:25.084
- Huh... I'm going to go inside.

22:25.236 --> 22:26.660
I'm sure that I heard the phone.

22:26.754 --> 22:28.253
(phone ringing)

22:28.406 --> 22:31.090
- Well, I can't help you.

22:31.184 --> 22:34.243
The spirit of six degrees
is one of anonymity.

22:34.261 --> 22:35.744
- Well, speaking of that,

22:35.838 --> 22:38.022
I actually have an enticing
thing to offer you in return.

22:39.007 --> 22:41.359
See, I think six degrees
has a lot of potential.

22:42.770 --> 22:43.694
- Not interested.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.491
(sighs)

22:49.035 --> 22:50.034
(jason grunts)

22:51.429 --> 22:52.870
- I could help you make it
a household name,

22:53.097 --> 22:54.205
Along the lines
of "white elephant."

22:54.432 --> 22:57.433
We could loop in
investors, sponsors.

22:57.451 --> 22:59.210
- And we just got
that quick analysis back.

23:00.529 --> 23:02.380
It would be an advantageous
follow up to sparkltree.

23:03.699 --> 23:05.774
- Definitely not interested.

23:06.444 --> 23:07.868
That's not what
the site's about.

23:07.887 --> 23:11.055
- Though, I don't recall
seeing a copyright.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.134
Which means there's
nothing to stop us from

23:15.286 --> 23:16.394
Just taking off with it anyway.

23:17.546 --> 23:18.062
- Is that a threat?

23:19.790 --> 23:22.215
- No, I'm just thinking
out loud.

23:22.309 --> 23:24.068
There's gotta be some way
I can convince you to help me

23:24.219 --> 23:25.319
Find ms. Santa #1.

23:27.815 --> 23:30.741
- Wait, which is it that you
want? Ms. Santa or six degrees?

23:31.411 --> 23:33.077
- Well, both.

23:34.989 --> 23:38.249
I'm just hoping we could
make a deal, you know,
help each other.

23:39.585 --> 23:41.493
- If you really want
to help people,

23:41.646 --> 23:43.587
Maybe help some
of the small businesses

23:43.739 --> 23:45.423
That your industry
is destroying.

23:45.650 --> 23:47.758
- You mean like this one?
Sure! Easy-peasy.

23:49.578 --> 23:50.836
I'll tell you what.

23:50.988 --> 23:53.097
You help me find
ms. Santa #1,

23:54.492 --> 23:56.508
I'll help with your foot traffic
and marketing.

23:57.603 --> 24:00.104
Mcnevin paper company
will see unprecedented sales.

24:02.333 --> 24:05.834
- Well, I mean, what if we can't
find ms. Santa #1?

24:05.853 --> 24:09.095
You know, or we do
and she's like 99 years old

24:09.115 --> 24:12.783
Or, you know, loathes
your very existence?

24:12.935 --> 24:15.435
I mean, do our terms
still stand?

24:15.529 --> 24:17.621
- Sure. I don't think it'll
be any of those scenarios.

24:18.849 --> 24:20.349
- Okay, so to confirm,

24:21.352 --> 24:23.852
You help boost mcnevin paper
company sales,

24:23.946 --> 24:26.112
And you leave six degrees alone.

24:26.132 --> 24:28.466
No push for growth from you
or any of your companies.

24:29.694 --> 24:30.784
- This is the weirdest deal
I've ever made.

24:30.878 --> 24:32.027
- Oh, just promise!

24:32.046 --> 24:34.138
- I promise.

24:38.811 --> 24:39.727
- It's a deal.

24:44.225 --> 24:45.483
- Elliott.

24:47.987 --> 24:49.487
(bright music)

24:51.657 --> 24:55.159
- So you made a deal
with him to find you.

24:55.828 --> 24:57.402
- Correct.

24:57.555 --> 24:59.388
Look, I was this whirlwind
of confusion!

24:59.406 --> 25:01.724
You know, at first, I wanted
to protect six degrees,

25:01.817 --> 25:03.909
But then he mentioned helping
the shop,

25:04.895 --> 25:06.486
And I was mad I didn't
think of it first.

25:07.155 --> 25:08.321
- Well, you have been known

25:08.341 --> 25:10.399
To occasionally miss
the forest for the trees.

25:10.492 --> 25:12.417
- Mmm... For the sparkltrees.

25:12.512 --> 25:13.427
(laughing)

25:14.496 --> 25:15.829
- Option one...
- Yeah.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.573
- You come clean
and you tell him that

25:17.591 --> 25:19.016
The mystery match is you.

25:20.094 --> 25:21.093
Just see where it goes!

25:21.187 --> 25:23.354
- No! Definitely not.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.857
Everything about him
goes against everything
that I care about.

25:28.010 --> 25:29.693
And I feel it would
nullify the deal.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.087
You know, why work up
all of these terms only
to turn around and say,

25:32.106 --> 25:33.864
"hey, guess what? It's me!
Pay up now!"

25:34.441 --> 25:35.199
No, that would never fly.

25:36.927 --> 25:38.702
And you know I'm not
dating right now.

25:40.022 --> 25:42.097
- It's quite the pickle.
Mm-hmm.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.190
- No, except, maybe not!

25:44.210 --> 25:47.119
You know, these tech
guys are always looking
for a new project,

25:47.213 --> 25:50.122
And then, within 48 hours,
they lose interest and move on.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.940
So I'm counting on that.

25:51.959 --> 25:54.051
- No, I'm not interested
in buying more followers.

25:54.795 --> 25:56.220
That's so cringe.

25:57.798 --> 25:59.131
- The only thing that concerns
me is finding something

25:59.283 --> 26:00.391
For him to lose interest in.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.228
- You could just hire an actor
to play ms. Santa #1.

26:05.306 --> 26:07.472
- Yeah, maybe someone
looking for a little publicity?

26:07.567 --> 26:08.399
- Ah...

26:13.631 --> 26:16.740
You hang out with him once,
maybe twice,

26:16.892 --> 26:19.743
You know, take some selfies,
create some hashtags.

26:19.970 --> 26:23.414
It will boost your online
presence exponentially.

26:23.565 --> 26:25.974
And it doesn't have to be
more than one day, maybe two.

26:26.068 --> 26:28.252
Unless you want it to be more?

26:29.255 --> 26:31.255
- Nah, he's not my type.

26:31.406 --> 26:37.011
I mean, he's objectively
handsome in a "pulling off a
turtleneck" sort of way. But no.

26:39.748 --> 26:41.490
I won't have to break up
with him, will I?

26:41.583 --> 26:43.434
(laughing)
- um, no. No.

26:43.661 --> 26:45.436
I guarantee that
he will lose interest.

26:46.513 --> 26:47.253
Not because of you!

26:47.273 --> 26:48.439
But because...

26:49.834 --> 26:51.257
The tech lizard brain.

26:52.503 --> 26:54.945
Look, I know that this lie
may be a little dicey.

26:55.172 --> 26:56.521
- Are you kidding me?
(chuckles)

26:56.616 --> 26:59.341
With all the hijinks that get
bandied about in the online

26:59.434 --> 27:01.452
Dating world, this is nothing!

27:03.030 --> 27:05.956
- Well, I prefer to see it as
an acceptable white lie

27:06.183 --> 27:09.868
That helps multiple
small businesses.

27:09.962 --> 27:11.962
All you have to do is pretend
to be santa #1.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.381
This is your roadmap.

27:15.209 --> 27:16.967
You love this book.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.137
And I will text you
what I wrote in the front cover.

27:21.957 --> 27:24.366
- Is there a chance that he can
discover that it's really you?

27:24.385 --> 27:25.476
- No, no!

27:27.295 --> 27:28.479
Slim. Yeah.

27:30.298 --> 27:32.483
But he'd basically have to track
back through all of the santas,

27:32.710 --> 27:33.984
And that's the beauty
of this plan,

27:34.136 --> 27:35.468
Because even if he does,

27:35.562 --> 27:39.657
Santa #2 was leonard,
our mailman! So, we're covered!

27:42.069 --> 27:43.568
- Sounds easy enough!
What's the next step?

27:43.663 --> 27:44.495
(sighs)

27:46.499 --> 27:48.332
- Admiring your work?

27:50.744 --> 27:53.061
- Just thinking ahead
to sparkltree 2.0.

27:53.822 --> 27:56.489
- Ooh! That sounds
christmas magical.

27:56.509 --> 27:57.925
- It is magical.

27:59.011 --> 28:01.679
Here, this is for you.

28:03.741 --> 28:05.498
- Is this part of our deal?

28:06.410 --> 28:07.685
- No, it's just
a nice thing to do.

28:08.854 --> 28:09.687
- Hmm.

28:13.100 --> 28:14.191
This is peppermint.

28:15.769 --> 28:16.935
- I saw on your swift-gram
that you like the peppermint

28:17.029 --> 28:20.114
Coffee from the kiosk
downstairs. I'm thorough.

28:22.927 --> 28:24.702
You seem to have
a certain idea of me.

28:25.538 --> 28:26.370
But that's okay.

28:27.373 --> 28:29.281
The lower your opinion
is of me,

28:29.375 --> 28:31.542
The more impressive it will be
when I become...

28:31.769 --> 28:32.543
Impressive.

28:34.455 --> 28:38.882
- Well, this impressive
journey will be brief.

28:39.034 --> 28:42.202
Good news! I found
ms. Santa #1!

28:42.221 --> 28:45.280
Yeah, I was able to track
her back through the website

28:45.373 --> 28:47.874
And, you know,
it's a crazy coincidence,

28:47.893 --> 28:51.395
Because I actually know her.
Yeah! She's my neighbour!

28:53.290 --> 28:56.141
Well, maybe not that crazy
a coincidence,

28:56.293 --> 28:57.976
Since, you know,
most of the people that use

28:58.070 --> 28:59.403
Six degrees of santa
are people that I know

28:59.554 --> 29:04.241
Because my website is so
underdeveloped, like you said.

29:05.636 --> 29:08.153
Her name is zoey.
I will send you her number.

29:08.305 --> 29:09.395
And yeah, good luck with that.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.081
I'll be in touch about
my side of the deal.

29:11.233 --> 29:13.083
- Wait!
- What?

29:14.903 --> 29:16.253
- That can't be it.

29:16.480 --> 29:17.329
I mean, especially since
you know her.

29:17.423 --> 29:19.314
You gotta give me
some details here.

29:19.407 --> 29:22.334
I mean, what does she like?

29:23.504 --> 29:25.912
- Well, she's public on all
her social media platforms,

29:25.931 --> 29:27.598
So, you know,
figure her out,

29:28.993 --> 29:30.492
Like you did
with the peppermint coffee.

29:31.604 --> 29:33.753
Isn't that how we learn
about each other these days?

29:33.847 --> 29:35.272
- But that's not
your philosophy.

29:36.424 --> 29:39.259
- That's okay. You do you.

29:39.353 --> 29:42.521
- Also, this doesn't seem
like a very good deal for me.

29:42.673 --> 29:44.523
You just give me a phone number,

29:44.617 --> 29:46.842
And then I help rescue
your family business?

29:46.860 --> 29:49.361
Rise from the ashes?
Completely save it? No.

29:49.938 --> 29:52.514
Why don't you come with me

29:52.533 --> 29:54.774
And we'll scope out
the situation a little?

29:54.868 --> 29:57.777
Maybe we can even organize
one of those quirky run-ins

29:57.797 --> 29:59.521
That they do in the movies,
you know?

29:59.540 --> 30:01.781
- A meet-cute?
- Sure.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.026
- How can you be one of
the most successful people

30:04.119 --> 30:06.136
In the world and not know
what that is?

30:07.139 --> 30:08.454
Can't your assistant help you?

30:09.383 --> 30:10.641
- I gave him time off
for the holiday.

30:16.557 --> 30:19.391
- Fine, yeah. Fine.

30:19.485 --> 30:22.986
But you know what?
I need to call my mom first.

30:23.138 --> 30:24.229
- Sure.
- Yeah.

30:24.381 --> 30:26.806
- Tell her I say hello.
- Mmm, not likely.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.325
(sighs)
oh man...

30:33.315 --> 30:34.998
(phone ringing tone)

30:36.318 --> 30:39.336
Zoey, hey, okay,
bear with me here.

30:40.731 --> 30:42.005
We're going to need
to add a little theatre.

30:44.492 --> 30:49.329
She teaches workout classes,
she's some kind of influencer,

30:49.348 --> 30:51.664
And she also sells
artwork on craft-zalea.

30:51.684 --> 30:53.517
So she's really into
the gig economy,

30:53.744 --> 30:55.185
So you'll have lots
to talk about.

30:56.355 --> 30:57.312
- She is quite pretty.

30:58.098 --> 30:59.022
- Well, that's a win-win!

31:00.601 --> 31:03.101
And I also know from her feed
that she often comes here

31:03.253 --> 31:05.437
For a snack after teaching
a pilates class.

31:05.589 --> 31:07.589
So, you know, we just have
to keep a lookout

31:07.608 --> 31:11.776
And maybe we can stage one of
those so-called quirky run-ins.

31:12.613 --> 31:14.354
Maybe you can bump into
each other,

31:14.448 --> 31:17.523
Or you both reach for the
last pastry at the same time.

31:18.360 --> 31:19.710
- Maybe the coffee
spilling thing?

31:19.937 --> 31:21.786
That's usually pretty cute, no?
No?

31:21.881 --> 31:23.213
- No. Definitely not.

31:25.867 --> 31:27.050
(jason sighs)

31:27.202 --> 31:29.127
- Do you think I should tell
her the whole truth?

31:29.704 --> 31:31.054
Like, that I sought her out?

31:32.449 --> 31:34.474
- Well, uh, it depends.

31:36.303 --> 31:38.729
You know what? Maybe the fewer
the charades, the better.

31:39.973 --> 31:41.806
- See, this is what I don't
get about six degrees of santa.

31:41.901 --> 31:43.975
Here you have
an opportunity for a genuine,

31:44.069 --> 31:46.128
Charade-free connection,

31:46.221 --> 31:47.979
And your system
literally prevents that.

31:48.132 --> 31:49.965
- It's not a matchmaking
service.

31:50.725 --> 31:52.801
- You know, I actually
had a dream about

31:52.819 --> 31:54.077
Six degrees last night.

31:54.304 --> 31:56.747
Sometimes I have these
creative problem-solving dreams.

31:56.974 --> 31:58.490
- Will you please stop dreaming
about my website?

31:58.642 --> 32:00.325
- But it has so much
untapped potential.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.668
- Mmm, not your problem!

32:02.813 --> 32:05.571
- Oh, no. I need
to get a napkin.

32:05.666 --> 32:08.741
- I will go. You stay here
and keep an eye out for zoey.

32:08.835 --> 32:10.743
And you know, please,
stop dreaming about my website.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.412
Oh!
(gasps)

32:12.431 --> 32:15.081
- Harper? My neighbour?
Is that you?

32:15.100 --> 32:16.600
(forced laughter)

32:17.269 --> 32:18.101
- Zoey!

32:19.496 --> 32:20.328
- Here, here.
- What are you doing here?

32:20.347 --> 32:21.438
- Use this.

32:22.849 --> 32:24.590
- No, it's too nice.

32:24.685 --> 32:25.943
- It's fine, here.

32:28.763 --> 32:31.281
Hi. I'm jason.
- I'm zoey.

32:32.009 --> 32:32.841
- Hi, zoey.

32:32.859 --> 32:33.617
- Um...

32:34.453 --> 32:35.452
- Um...

32:36.789 --> 32:38.121
(light music)

32:46.465 --> 32:47.355
- Smells good.

32:47.449 --> 32:48.281
(jason): So, are you new to...

32:48.375 --> 32:49.949
- Yeah, just around the corner.

32:49.969 --> 32:53.136
I teach dance fitness
and yoga. That's where I was.

32:55.457 --> 32:58.383
O-m-g! Harper,

32:58.477 --> 32:59.977
You will not believe
what we just discovered!

33:01.038 --> 33:02.387
- What did you just discover?

33:02.481 --> 33:06.799
- Jason and I here are part
of the same six degrees chain...

33:06.819 --> 33:08.986
That I started with a book
called neighbourhood elf.

33:09.730 --> 33:10.487
(both): Northbound elf.

33:11.490 --> 33:12.406
(zoey): Right!
(forced laughter)

33:13.158 --> 33:14.491
I'm just shaken up about

33:14.718 --> 33:16.243
The bizarreness
of this coincidence!

33:18.330 --> 33:19.830
We should commemorate
this moment.

33:20.057 --> 33:21.665
- Yeah.
- Oh, sure, yeah. Okay.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.251
(giggling)

33:29.233 --> 33:30.340
(upbeat synth music)

33:33.754 --> 33:35.828
- So, I was thinking about
the different variations

33:35.848 --> 33:36.847
Of this six degrees
of santa thing,

33:38.350 --> 33:39.683
And so there were four other
people in our gift chain.

33:40.686 --> 33:41.685
'I wonder who they were.

33:41.836 --> 33:43.336
- Well, I know one.

33:43.355 --> 33:46.189
Our mailman,
leonard, was santa #2,

33:47.008 --> 33:48.608
So that's something.

33:49.436 --> 33:50.944
- That is something.

33:55.200 --> 33:56.091
That's a great scarf.

33:56.184 --> 33:59.018
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

33:59.038 --> 34:01.371
- It's one of mine.
I mean, I designed it.

34:02.766 --> 34:04.449
I have a store on craft-zalea.

34:04.601 --> 34:06.209
- Oh, yes. Harper mentioned

34:06.436 --> 34:07.602
That you were working
the gig economy.

34:07.695 --> 34:10.363
- The shop is called zo-brad,

34:10.382 --> 34:13.717
'cause my name is zoey bradford
but no "e" or "y".

34:13.868 --> 34:16.294
In case you wanted to

34:16.388 --> 34:19.205
Check it out, or mention it,
or hashtag it.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.873
- Yeah, sure.

34:20.893 --> 34:22.059
(clears throat)

34:22.877 --> 34:23.894
(shutter clicking)

34:25.305 --> 34:28.123
- Yeah, I can get
my social media manager on it,

34:28.216 --> 34:29.649
And get you a mention or two.

34:30.294 --> 34:30.984
Yeah.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.298
So... Northbound elf.

34:36.316 --> 34:37.908
It seems like it really
meant a lot to you.

34:39.227 --> 34:42.079
- Totally. Yes.
(chuckles)

34:43.490 --> 34:45.990
There's this part when
elfie is in machu picchu,

34:46.143 --> 34:48.919
And I was like...
(sighs)

34:49.663 --> 34:51.070
I need to travel more!

34:51.090 --> 34:51.755
(zoey laughs)

34:54.651 --> 34:57.076
- That's, uh...
A worthwhile goal.

34:57.170 --> 34:58.261
(chuckles awkwardly)

34:58.931 --> 34:59.912
Cheers.

35:00.006 --> 35:01.264
(soft holiday music)

35:04.103 --> 35:05.936
- Look, this woman
had a great idea!

35:07.589 --> 35:09.922
She said, "this year, I gifted
a set of cookie cutters

35:10.016 --> 35:12.776
And my grandma's cookie recipe.

35:14.504 --> 35:17.030
It felt like keeping her love
alive and spreading it around.

35:18.117 --> 35:19.616
Thank you for making
this happen."

35:21.845 --> 35:22.953
Do you want to read
the next one?

35:26.441 --> 35:27.707
- Where is kolkata?

35:28.961 --> 35:29.876
- What?!

35:30.796 --> 35:32.129
It's in india.

35:33.281 --> 35:35.781
It's from a young man
named arjun.

35:36.526 --> 35:38.301
He's wondering how his gift...

35:39.787 --> 35:43.122
A snow globe from st. Louis
made it all the way to him,

35:43.142 --> 35:46.384
And he wants to start
his own chain.

35:46.979 --> 35:48.478
- Can you get him a box in time?

35:49.797 --> 35:51.815
- Oh, I don't think so, but...

35:53.560 --> 35:54.985
Well, what do you think we
should do, business partner?

35:57.305 --> 35:59.489
- Could he make his own box?

36:00.550 --> 36:02.826
- Great idea. I'll let him know.

36:07.891 --> 36:09.741
(harper): I finally fixed
the ordering page!

36:09.835 --> 36:11.334
- Oh, my hero!

36:14.231 --> 36:16.731
Oh! You practising
for the party tonight?

36:18.326 --> 36:21.085
- I thought you were
representing us in the wrapping
competition this year.

36:21.180 --> 36:22.404
- No, it's your turn.

36:22.422 --> 36:23.755
(phone ringing)

36:23.849 --> 36:25.073
- One sec.
(gasps)

36:25.166 --> 36:28.092
Oh! So, how did the date go?

36:28.245 --> 36:29.761
- I thought I did my job.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.004
It was just bad enough,
kept it believable.

36:32.024 --> 36:34.524
I really played up
the insincere influencer thing.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.026
Zero chemistry.

36:36.177 --> 36:38.344
- Good. Good, good, good.

36:38.438 --> 36:40.947
- Yes. Except he scheduled
a second date, for tonight!

36:42.350 --> 36:43.925
I don't know if he thought
it went well, or...?

36:44.870 --> 36:48.780
- Oh. Well, I mean, did you
at least get an online boost?

36:48.932 --> 36:51.357
- Such a boost!
Everything's gone nuts.

36:51.451 --> 36:53.451
I have all these orders,
so now I'm, like, overbooked.

36:54.454 --> 36:56.028
I don't know what to do about
this second date.

36:56.122 --> 36:58.381
<i> Do I go and act horribly?</i>
<i> Chew with my mouth open?</i>

36:59.292 --> 37:00.217
- Let me...

37:02.370 --> 37:03.887
See what I can do on my end.

37:04.556 --> 37:05.222
Okay.

37:06.466 --> 37:08.725
Um, wrapping paper malfunction.

37:09.877 --> 37:11.394
- Good morning, you two!
Here you go.

37:11.621 --> 37:13.455
- Hi! Oh, thanks!
- You're welcome.

37:13.548 --> 37:15.065
- Please, feel free to browse.

37:15.292 --> 37:16.399
We have a friends
and family discount.

37:18.311 --> 37:20.737
- So, how did the date go?

37:21.723 --> 37:23.907
- The date was... Not great.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.561
- Oh! Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

37:29.564 --> 37:31.248
- But I've already gone ahead
and scheduled a second date.

37:32.751 --> 37:34.809
You know, at first I was
a little irked that it seemed

37:34.828 --> 37:37.570
Like she was just using me to
boost her social media presence.

37:37.589 --> 37:41.258
But then I thought,
why be offended by her being
a savvy business woman?

37:42.910 --> 37:44.761
When I brought up
northbound elf, yeah,

37:44.912 --> 37:46.596
Her response
was a little flip,

37:47.582 --> 37:50.433
But why should I expect
her to open up right away?

37:50.585 --> 37:51.768
On command, you know?

37:54.514 --> 37:57.107
- That's actually a very mature
way of looking at things.

37:58.018 --> 37:59.276
(clears throat)

37:59.427 --> 38:02.946
But didn't you have
one of those popular life-talks?

38:03.097 --> 38:05.931
You know, about sunken costs
and minimizing wasted time?

38:06.026 --> 38:10.345
I mean, if the first date
did not work, why not move on?

38:10.363 --> 38:12.622
- That's what I used to do,
just move on to the next thing.

38:14.108 --> 38:15.683
But if this connection
felt different, then shouldn't

38:15.777 --> 38:16.626
I approach it differently?

38:19.113 --> 38:20.297
- I don't know, I...

38:21.449 --> 38:23.883
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

38:28.974 --> 38:29.806
(jason sighs)

38:31.977 --> 38:33.476
- Oh, no way!

38:33.628 --> 38:34.644
Roller skates?

38:35.630 --> 38:36.479
Do you sell these?

38:37.223 --> 38:38.148
- No, those are mine.

38:39.543 --> 38:42.152
And no, we do not sell them.

38:45.715 --> 38:48.992
- Okay, quick six degrees
question for you.

38:50.403 --> 38:51.661
Why stop at number six?

38:52.814 --> 38:54.480
- Well, that's the saying,
isn't it?

38:55.225 --> 38:56.833
"six degrees of separation."

38:58.562 --> 39:01.153
You know, and the box
won't last forever.

39:02.490 --> 39:04.065
And aren't you supposed
to be one of the busiest
people in the world?

39:04.158 --> 39:05.175
I mean, how do you have time to,

39:05.326 --> 39:07.585
You know, hang out
and critique my hobby?

39:08.162 --> 39:10.805
- Oh, well, I am on hiatus.

39:11.516 --> 39:12.907
Yeah, I'm taking a break

39:13.000 --> 39:14.592
From work for the first
time in years.

39:14.744 --> 39:16.744
- Oh!

39:16.763 --> 39:18.580
Now it all makes sense.

39:18.673 --> 39:20.106
You're not looking for love.

39:21.418 --> 39:23.342
You are looking
for a new project!

39:23.362 --> 39:26.087
And maybe that's something
that I can help you with.

39:26.180 --> 39:28.198
You know, we can spitball
some ideas, huh?

39:28.349 --> 39:30.367
I mean, why don't we revisit
the christmas tree hologram

39:30.518 --> 39:31.759
That I pitched you
in the elevator?

39:31.778 --> 39:33.519
Yeah? Or, um... I mean,

39:33.538 --> 39:35.763
What is the sparkltree
of valentine's day?

39:36.208 --> 39:37.448
- How about we discuss

39:37.542 --> 39:40.710
The sales makeover
I had planned for this place?

39:41.380 --> 39:43.287
- Sure, yeah.

39:43.440 --> 39:44.381
Talk to me. Where do we start?

39:46.459 --> 39:51.203
- Done. I just dropped you
the sparkltree companion app.

39:51.223 --> 39:53.706
There's a new feature
on the mcnevin paper company.

39:53.725 --> 39:55.633
I filed it under
gift wrapping ideas.

39:55.785 --> 39:57.376
I thought that was
the perfect home for it.

39:57.470 --> 40:00.146
- I just, I thought we were
working on this together.

40:02.459 --> 40:06.152
You know, I have to admit,
this is... It's not bad.

40:08.389 --> 40:10.298
But this seems very generous.

40:10.316 --> 40:11.574
(phone chiming)

40:17.657 --> 40:19.916
- Oh, it's zoey. She just
cancelled our date tonight.

40:21.811 --> 40:22.669
(soft music)

40:23.588 --> 40:24.479
- You know what?

40:24.497 --> 40:25.922
Maybe the significance of all

40:26.149 --> 40:28.741
Of this is that your heart
is open.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.744
You know? So why don't you
try online dating, huh?

40:31.763 --> 40:32.929
That's a project!

40:34.266 --> 40:38.009
- Oh, can you believe
haley just cancelled?

40:38.161 --> 40:40.687
You're going to have
to find somebody else
to compete against.

40:41.440 --> 40:42.105
(gasps)

40:43.775 --> 40:46.276
Well, unless jason could do it.

40:49.614 --> 40:51.339
- Uh, I do have
the night free now.

40:51.357 --> 40:55.009
- Can we really invite
jason sparks to a small business

40:55.102 --> 40:56.786
Christmas party
for local businesses?

40:58.865 --> 41:00.364
- Yeah, that is a pickle.

41:00.459 --> 41:02.625
Oh, heck. Let's just
put him in a disguise!

41:05.188 --> 41:09.299
- Ho-ho-ho! Merry christmas!

41:10.026 --> 41:10.800
(chuckling)

41:13.046 --> 41:14.637
(soft clapping)

41:14.789 --> 41:17.056
- Hey, mom!
- Hey, honey! Ooh!

41:18.477 --> 41:19.867
- Who is this?

41:19.961 --> 41:22.979
- Oh! Why, I'm santa, of course.

41:23.798 --> 41:24.981
- This is jason, he is a...

41:26.059 --> 41:27.066
A work colleague?

41:28.561 --> 41:30.044
This is my daughter, dani.

41:30.063 --> 41:32.563
- Hi, dani. It's very
nice to meet you.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.640
Now, tell me, how were
my santa belly laughs?

41:34.659 --> 41:36.409
And be honest,
on a scale of one to ten?

41:38.330 --> 41:41.164
- Uh, maybe five.

41:41.983 --> 41:43.333
- Geez, tough crowd.

41:44.227 --> 41:45.393
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

41:45.486 --> 41:48.320
Maybe I'll even hire you
on as a santa consultant.

41:48.340 --> 41:49.488
We could use somebody
like you around.

41:49.508 --> 41:50.507
(glass clinking)

41:53.160 --> 41:55.995
- I hope everyone is enjoying

41:56.089 --> 41:59.665
This celebration of christmas
and local small business!

41:59.759 --> 42:01.000
As many of you know,

42:01.094 --> 42:06.022
We have our traditional
gift wrapping tournament,

42:06.249 --> 42:09.083
Sponsored by the mcnevin
paper company!

42:09.176 --> 42:10.918
The mcnevin family
is being represented

42:11.012 --> 42:12.845
By my daughter harper this year,

42:12.864 --> 42:16.440
Who will compete against
a customary celebrity guest.

42:16.535 --> 42:20.595
And this year,
our celebrity is santa claus!

42:20.613 --> 42:21.854
(applause)

42:21.873 --> 42:23.540
- Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

42:25.026 --> 42:26.209
Thank you, young lady.

42:26.436 --> 42:27.785
You've been a good girl
this year.

42:27.879 --> 42:31.773
- Oh! Well, competitors
will be judged on speed,

42:31.791 --> 42:34.217
Technique, and creativity!

42:36.796 --> 42:38.054
(harper): Thank you.

42:39.391 --> 42:40.798
You know, I hope you're ready
for defeat.

42:40.950 --> 42:42.058
I grew up in this industry,

42:42.209 --> 42:43.785
So, I was somewhat

42:43.803 --> 42:46.229
Of a wunderkind and I've
only improved from there.

42:46.456 --> 42:48.472
- You know,
I'm not so bad myself.

42:49.216 --> 42:50.883
It's all about making
shapes and forms,

42:50.902 --> 42:55.313
And my visuospatial ability
is unparalleled.

42:55.407 --> 42:56.573
- And go!

42:57.725 --> 42:59.634
♪ it's that time of year ♪

43:00.303 --> 43:02.912
♪ santa comes
to bring that cheer ♪

43:03.064 --> 43:04.080
- Your side, please.

43:04.231 --> 43:05.081
(harper): Oh, it's on.

43:06.976 --> 43:09.493

43:20.265 --> 43:21.431
(applause)

44:20.474 --> 44:21.491
(indistinct chatter)

44:23.662 --> 44:26.737
- There has been
a noticeable increase

44:26.831 --> 44:29.148
In our online sales
for the last few hours.

44:29.242 --> 44:31.909
- Well, that must be from jason
putting us up on his app.

44:32.061 --> 44:34.745
(chuckles)
oh, tech mogul who's actually

44:34.839 --> 44:36.339
Good at what he does.

44:37.825 --> 44:39.509
(indistinct chatter)

44:42.071 --> 44:44.422
- I didn't know that zoey
was coming.

44:44.516 --> 44:45.907
- Yeah...

44:45.925 --> 44:47.350
I forgot I invited her,

44:47.577 --> 44:50.578
Otherwise I would have
warned jason.

44:50.596 --> 44:52.188
She stood him up today.

44:53.917 --> 44:55.525
- Wasn't that basically
your plan?

44:56.936 --> 44:59.587
- Uh, yea... Yeah...

44:59.680 --> 45:01.531
I mean... But it's awkward.

45:03.851 --> 45:06.277
I'm beginning to feel guilty.

45:06.371 --> 45:08.204
What do you think would happen
if I told him?

45:10.266 --> 45:12.041
- There's only one way
to find out.

45:17.549 --> 45:19.966
(door opening)

45:22.721 --> 45:24.128
- That was really fun.

45:24.222 --> 45:26.055
(chuckling)
- yes.

45:26.207 --> 45:28.558
- One santa suit.
- Ah.

45:28.709 --> 45:32.395
And one... Sweater.

45:32.622 --> 45:34.230
- Thank you.

45:39.812 --> 45:42.238
- I have to tell you something--
- so, I came clean-- oh.

45:42.465 --> 45:44.389
- You go.
- I just wanted to tell you

45:44.409 --> 45:47.410
That zoey apologized for
cancelling our date earlier.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.821
So, feeling inspired,

45:50.915 --> 45:55.251
I came clean that I sought
her out as miss santa #1.

45:55.402 --> 45:58.087
And I told her that you were
kind enough to help me out.

45:59.924 --> 46:01.740
- Wow. That's...

46:01.834 --> 46:03.150
That's great news.

46:03.244 --> 46:07.263
It must feel really good
to get that off your chest.

46:07.414 --> 46:09.490
- Yeah. Yeah.

46:09.583 --> 46:12.326
She took it surprisingly well.

46:12.419 --> 46:14.353
She wasn't even mad at all.

46:15.181 --> 46:17.181
You know, like, yes,

46:17.275 --> 46:20.425
I wish that we had connected
more on our date,

46:20.445 --> 46:24.505
But it's just that gut-feeling
I got from the book

46:24.524 --> 46:27.116
And... I just feel like

46:27.343 --> 46:29.619
I have to see it through,
you know?

46:31.197 --> 46:33.623
- You gotta follow
that gut-feeling, I guess.

46:35.184 --> 46:36.867
(soft music)

46:36.961 --> 46:38.419
- Yeah.

46:39.780 --> 46:42.131
Uh, so sorry, what were
you gonna say earlier?

46:42.358 --> 46:47.637
- Oh, um, yeah,
I wanted to say...

46:51.810 --> 46:53.625
...Thank you.

46:53.719 --> 46:56.128
You've been a lot of help today

46:56.147 --> 47:01.317
And my mom says that online
sales are definitely up.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.545
So...
- Well, you're welcome.

47:04.638 --> 47:07.398
You know, I really meant it when
I said you had beautiful store.

47:07.550 --> 47:11.160
I love this place,
so, I'm happy to help.

47:15.834 --> 47:17.741
- If only we could find out
how the present

47:17.894 --> 47:20.227
Made it halfway
across the world.

47:20.246 --> 47:22.063
- You know how this works:

47:22.081 --> 47:23.898
Anonymous christmas magic.

47:23.991 --> 47:25.675
- I just wish arjun in india

47:25.902 --> 47:28.752
Could talk to a santa #1
about st. Louis.

47:28.847 --> 47:31.088
Or that one dad could send
the thank you note

47:31.182 --> 47:32.998
About the ukulele
that changed his son's life.

47:33.092 --> 47:34.575
(doorbell ringing)

47:34.594 --> 47:36.577
(knocking)
- finish getting ready, okay?

47:36.670 --> 47:38.354
We gotta get you to school.

47:42.585 --> 47:44.777
- I think I may actually
like jason.

47:46.531 --> 47:48.105
(whimsical music)

47:48.199 --> 47:49.866
- Come on in.

47:50.017 --> 47:51.275
- I mean, I don't...

47:51.427 --> 47:54.095
Not like him in an epic way.

47:54.188 --> 47:55.779
I felt bad about cancelling,

47:55.874 --> 47:57.707
So I came to your party
to cheer myself up,

47:57.858 --> 47:59.358
Not knowing he'd be there.

47:59.452 --> 48:02.461
Then... I saw him.

48:04.107 --> 48:06.716
And then there
was something lively.

48:06.943 --> 48:09.276
And maybe something
sweet about him?

48:09.370 --> 48:11.962
Something I missed earlier?

48:12.056 --> 48:14.798
- I suppose he's had a few
surprising moments.

48:14.893 --> 48:16.967
- Right?!

48:17.061 --> 48:19.211
Anyway, I don't know
if this is good or bad,

48:19.305 --> 48:20.897
Cause... You know?

48:22.458 --> 48:24.317
(whispering): The web of lies.

48:26.220 --> 48:29.813
- No, I think that this
is great news.

48:29.908 --> 48:32.316
And if it does work out
with you two, then...

48:32.410 --> 48:35.411
The book did bring you together,
just indirectly.

48:35.638 --> 48:38.563
- And this is a thing
we review...

48:38.583 --> 48:40.082
Down the road?

48:44.647 --> 48:47.924
- We cannot deny,
jason really helped us.

48:48.927 --> 48:50.343
- He did.

48:53.656 --> 48:54.931
(soft music)

48:58.995 --> 49:00.770
- You didn't tell him, did you?

49:00.921 --> 49:02.012
- I couldn't.

49:02.106 --> 49:04.515
I just saw how earnest
he is in his pursuit,

49:04.667 --> 49:06.000
And... I chickened out.

49:06.093 --> 49:09.503
Plus, you know, zoey says
she may actually be into him.

49:09.522 --> 49:11.596
So, if I told him the truth,
I could ruin things

49:11.616 --> 49:12.949
For both of them.

49:13.785 --> 49:16.193
- So, is that it then?

49:16.345 --> 49:18.028
The deal is all done?

49:18.181 --> 49:20.197
- Well, he helped us out.

49:20.349 --> 49:23.125
He left six degrees alone and...

49:23.277 --> 49:27.538
Maybe I didn't connect him
to the real miss santa #1...

49:28.466 --> 49:30.615
- You.
- Yes, but I did provide him

49:30.710 --> 49:32.117
With a connection.

49:32.211 --> 49:34.136
A better one, so...

49:36.808 --> 49:38.808
- He helped mcnevin
paper company.

49:40.144 --> 49:41.793
Maybe when everything
slows down,

49:41.813 --> 49:43.962
You bring him some of those
pastries you brought in.

49:43.982 --> 49:46.056
A good old-fashioned
thank you, hmm?

49:46.150 --> 49:47.733
- Yeah.

49:51.322 --> 49:53.155
(sighs)

49:54.066 --> 49:55.324
(harper scoffs)

49:56.552 --> 49:59.386
Wow, you are bad
at being on hiatus.

49:59.405 --> 50:00.554
(chuckling)

50:00.573 --> 50:02.647
- Come in.

50:02.667 --> 50:04.834
Yeah, I um...

50:05.895 --> 50:08.078
I don't know where else to go.

50:08.172 --> 50:09.672
- Really?

50:09.899 --> 50:11.674
With all your resources?
(chuckling)

50:13.511 --> 50:16.345
So, are things back up
and running with zoey?

50:17.831 --> 50:21.425
- Yes, yes. We are getting
dinner tonight, actually.

50:21.519 --> 50:22.852
- Good.

50:26.673 --> 50:28.932
The book that started it all.

50:29.027 --> 50:30.584
(chuckles)

50:30.603 --> 50:32.253
(soft music)

50:32.271 --> 50:34.030
Ah, luminarias.

50:35.274 --> 50:37.608
You know it means illumination?

50:38.611 --> 50:41.537
Did you know the tradition
stems from small fires

50:41.764 --> 50:43.855
Used to guide scouts
and spirits home?

50:43.875 --> 50:45.690
- I did.

50:45.785 --> 50:47.618
- Hmm.
- You should read it.

50:47.770 --> 50:49.545
Borrow it and take it home
to dani.

50:52.275 --> 50:54.441
- Uh, well, the reason
I texted you

50:54.460 --> 50:57.795
Is I wanted to bring you
these as a thank you.

50:57.889 --> 51:00.281
Sales are definitely up.

51:00.374 --> 51:02.475
- Oh, that's great, thank you.

51:03.394 --> 51:04.560
What are they?

51:04.711 --> 51:06.120
- They're<i> kidyos.</i>

51:06.213 --> 51:08.481
It's an east indian
christmas dessert.

51:09.792 --> 51:12.309
Dani and I, we have
this little project,

51:12.403 --> 51:14.812
We read emails we get
from six degree santas,

51:14.964 --> 51:16.721
And when we get one
from somewhere new,

51:16.741 --> 51:19.650
We look up their traditions
and we make something.

51:19.744 --> 51:23.412
And dani's in charge,
so it's usually sweets.

51:24.640 --> 51:26.156
- Oh, wow,
these are really good.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.641
- Mm-hmm.

51:27.660 --> 51:30.068
Okay, okay, fine.

51:30.088 --> 51:31.921
Fine, let's take a stab
at improving

51:32.072 --> 51:34.148
Six degrees together.

51:34.166 --> 51:35.649
- What? Really?

51:35.742 --> 51:36.834
Wait, are you making a joke?

51:36.986 --> 51:38.669
(chuckling)
- no, it's...

51:38.763 --> 51:41.430
Something dani said
made me reconsider and...

51:42.767 --> 51:45.659
Well, I suppose you had
a few good points...

51:45.752 --> 51:48.011
- Mm, yes!
- ...Here and there.

51:48.164 --> 51:49.680
Are you fist pumping
because you're excited

51:49.774 --> 51:51.832
About connecting people,

51:51.851 --> 51:54.026
Or because you think you won
an ongoing argument?

51:55.354 --> 51:56.779
- Can't it be both?

51:58.674 --> 52:01.342
- Dani, hurry up please!
I gotta go!

52:01.435 --> 52:02.693
- Wow, you put the tree up.

52:02.845 --> 52:05.028
- Ah, yeah.
(chuckling)

52:05.181 --> 52:06.513
Uh, thanks for doing this
so last minute,

52:06.532 --> 52:07.957
I only need half a day,

52:08.184 --> 52:09.774
So I can pick up dani
on the way back.

52:09.869 --> 52:11.201
- Uh, no worries.

52:11.354 --> 52:13.520
I think it's cool that
you're beefing up six degrees.

52:13.539 --> 52:16.523
- Oh, well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves,

52:16.542 --> 52:18.375
But maybe.

52:18.469 --> 52:20.694
- Uh, quick question.

52:20.787 --> 52:22.212
You wouldn't happen to be
collaborating

52:22.365 --> 52:24.640
With this fellow, would you?

52:28.629 --> 52:29.979
I've seen that look.

52:31.040 --> 52:32.648
- I...

52:32.875 --> 52:35.042
I can't believe you
even follow him.

52:35.135 --> 52:37.135
- Well, he has good
life hacking tips.

52:37.155 --> 52:39.213
All I'm saying...

52:39.231 --> 52:42.383
Is that I'm sensing a new kind
of energy from you right now.

52:42.401 --> 52:46.328
It's either this new project,
or santa claus here, or both.

52:47.331 --> 52:49.072
Hey, either way,

52:49.225 --> 52:51.408
You should let yourself have it.

52:51.502 --> 52:53.410
- Like I said the day,

52:53.504 --> 52:56.505
I'm putting all of that
on the back-burner.

52:56.732 --> 52:59.824
And either way,
it's a non-starter,

52:59.844 --> 53:02.094
Because he's dating
my neighbour.

53:04.348 --> 53:05.514
- Oh.

53:09.687 --> 53:12.079
- I think a wall would be
a good middle ground

53:12.172 --> 53:14.097
For people to post publicly,

53:14.250 --> 53:17.267
Similarly that they would
a product review,

53:17.361 --> 53:19.269
Do you know what I mean?

53:19.422 --> 53:22.698
Like, "hey, loved
the reindeer sock puppet,

53:22.925 --> 53:25.201
Would santa #1
like to come forward?"

53:25.352 --> 53:27.778
You know?
- Yeah, but that's where

53:27.872 --> 53:30.021
The whole social media
element could go wrong,

53:30.041 --> 53:33.600
You know? It could lead
to competing and outdoing...

53:33.619 --> 53:35.211
(phone chiming)

53:37.215 --> 53:38.797
Is that zoey?

53:40.443 --> 53:43.777
- No, it's, um,
it's fabian lambert,

53:43.870 --> 53:45.779
You know, the celebrity chef?

53:45.872 --> 53:48.206
I hired him for a bake sale
fundraiser

53:48.226 --> 53:50.041
For this high school
basketball team,

53:50.135 --> 53:51.560
No cause too small.

53:52.955 --> 53:55.714
No, zoey is away for the day,
she's doing some

53:55.808 --> 53:59.476
Business ladies who craft,
or something? I don't know.

53:59.570 --> 54:02.238
(chuckling)
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

54:03.223 --> 54:06.633
- Yeah, um, right. Um, okay...

54:06.652 --> 54:09.987
So what if you're a young girl
who gets gifted,

54:10.139 --> 54:12.473
Um, you know, a hacky sack?

54:12.491 --> 54:16.335
And then you look online
and then you start to see the...

54:18.089 --> 54:19.904
- I am so sorry.

54:19.924 --> 54:21.982
Let me just finish this up
and we can focus, okay?

54:22.001 --> 54:23.259
- Sure.

54:24.428 --> 54:25.928
(whimsical music)

54:27.490 --> 54:29.339
- Hey, what flavour
sounds better to you,

54:29.492 --> 54:31.100
Lavender or cardamom?

54:32.252 --> 54:34.270
- For a christmas thing?

54:34.497 --> 54:36.421
- I'll just tell him
to do both.

54:36.440 --> 54:40.091
Ooh, how about this?
Maple gelatin caviar?

54:40.111 --> 54:41.593
That seems kind of seasonal,
right?

54:41.687 --> 54:43.445
- For a bake sale.

54:43.597 --> 54:45.281
(chuckles)
why are you getting

54:45.508 --> 54:47.508
Molecular gastronomy
involved in this?

54:47.601 --> 54:49.618
- It's just what fabian does.

54:49.845 --> 54:51.287
It'll be very
high-profile stuff.

54:51.514 --> 54:54.515
- It's for a high school
bake sale.

54:54.533 --> 54:57.200
I mean, what is it that
you've been going for

54:57.295 --> 55:00.796
Brand-wise lately?
Down to earth and sincere?

55:01.632 --> 55:03.206
- Uh-huh.

55:03.301 --> 55:05.283
- I've got a great idea.

55:05.303 --> 55:06.635
Get your coat.

55:11.367 --> 55:12.866
(soft music)

55:12.885 --> 55:14.718
Trust me, this is going
to be great marketing.

55:14.812 --> 55:16.979
For this bake sale,
jason sparks doesn't just

55:17.130 --> 55:20.131
Throw money at it, no, no,
he puts his back into it.

55:20.225 --> 55:22.559
He's just like us.
(laughing)

55:22.653 --> 55:24.135
- Well, that's great,

55:24.155 --> 55:27.881
But cooking isn't exactly
in my skill set.

55:27.974 --> 55:30.734
- Hmm. Well, I'm gonna teach you

55:30.828 --> 55:33.904
How to make my dad's molasses
spice cookies.

55:33.998 --> 55:36.056
They're world-famous.

55:36.075 --> 55:39.501
And my world famous I mean that
they are dani's favourite, so...

55:39.728 --> 55:42.579
(laughing)
- you have to wear this.

55:42.673 --> 55:44.414
- Okay.

55:44.508 --> 55:46.008
Thank you.

55:47.419 --> 55:50.161
- Not bad, not bad. Okay.

55:50.181 --> 55:51.663
(upbeat music)

55:51.757 --> 55:53.349
(indistinct chatter)

55:55.353 --> 55:57.244
(laughing)

55:57.262 --> 56:00.689
So with this, you want to stir
it seven times clockwise

56:00.916 --> 56:02.916
And three times
counter-clockwise

56:02.935 --> 56:04.008
And repeat it four times.

56:04.028 --> 56:05.778
- Uh, okay...

56:07.439 --> 56:08.939
(laughing)

56:09.033 --> 56:12.368
Hey, wait a second! You guys
are pulling my leg, I knew it.

56:13.704 --> 56:15.445
- Okay, so then you're gonna
use spoons...

56:15.539 --> 56:17.122
(sneezes)

56:19.693 --> 56:21.543
Yeah, put your back into it.

56:21.770 --> 56:22.786
- That's it.

56:22.880 --> 56:24.880
And right next to it?

56:25.031 --> 56:28.050
- Actually, if you turn this
upside down, then right side up,

56:28.277 --> 56:31.053
You get more cookies.
- Oh, clever.

56:32.556 --> 56:35.115
- Alright. Sweetie,
it's time for you to go

56:35.208 --> 56:36.967
Get ready for your
grandma's sleepover.

56:37.061 --> 56:39.302
And yes, you can take
some cookies with you.

56:39.397 --> 56:41.045
(giggling)

56:41.065 --> 56:42.639
- Thanks, mom.

56:42.791 --> 56:45.475
- Hey, you know what? I think
we made some darn good cookies

56:45.628 --> 56:47.903
Here tonight, let's have it,
up top, come on.

56:48.130 --> 56:51.740
Alright. Oh yeah, yeah,
there we go.

56:51.967 --> 56:54.243
(soft music)

56:56.747 --> 56:58.747
It was really nice hanging out
with dani today.

56:58.974 --> 57:00.657
(chuckling)
- isn't she the best?

57:00.751 --> 57:02.659
- She is.

57:02.753 --> 57:04.211
Thank you.

57:05.589 --> 57:09.758
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking of recruiting her

57:09.985 --> 57:13.912
As my decorative consultant
for sparkltree 2.0.

57:13.931 --> 57:16.765
(laughing)
- well, good luck with that,

57:16.917 --> 57:18.825
You know,
because she's an artist,

57:18.844 --> 57:23.105
So her approach is pure
and can't be commercialized.

57:23.332 --> 57:25.774
- We'll see about that.
(chuckling)

57:27.445 --> 57:29.361
So, um...

57:30.764 --> 57:33.097
Is dani's father
in the picture?

57:33.117 --> 57:35.451
- Yeah, derrick.

57:35.678 --> 57:38.436
Um, actually, he lives
in new york city

57:38.456 --> 57:42.040
And he's one of the reasons
that we moved back here.

57:43.202 --> 57:44.851
- And you guys get along,
you're doing

57:44.870 --> 57:46.444
The co-parenting thing?

57:46.464 --> 57:48.446
- Yeah, we do.

57:48.540 --> 57:51.800
And you know, we were just
better off as friends and...

57:52.027 --> 57:53.860
Well, we respect each other,
and I...

57:53.879 --> 57:55.554
I think that's important.

57:58.142 --> 58:00.625
So...

58:00.644 --> 58:02.144
What about you?

58:02.295 --> 58:04.813
What's your story?

58:06.484 --> 58:07.816
- Um...

58:08.043 --> 58:09.392
(chuckling)

58:09.487 --> 58:11.728
Well, uh,

58:11.822 --> 58:13.563
I suppose I used to spend
a lot of time bouncing

58:13.657 --> 58:16.158
From project to project,

58:16.309 --> 58:18.735
And with my relationships,

58:18.829 --> 58:22.072
I was always weighing
the risks versus reward.

58:22.224 --> 58:25.167
And often it seemed easier
to just move on.

58:26.820 --> 58:31.081
But then you begin to realize
that something's missing,

58:31.233 --> 58:33.083
Which is why I had such
a strong reaction

58:33.177 --> 58:35.511
To northbound elf
showing up in my life again.

58:36.588 --> 58:38.096
You know what's odd?

58:39.517 --> 58:42.409
I still don't really feel
that zoey matches the book

58:42.502 --> 58:44.019
Or the feeling in the note

58:44.170 --> 58:45.412
And certainly not
the feeling I had

58:45.505 --> 58:47.856
When the book showed up
on my doorstep. I mean...

58:50.677 --> 58:52.419
(sighs)
listen, I know how silly

58:52.437 --> 58:54.846
This sounds, all this
over a children's book.

58:54.865 --> 58:57.015
- No, it's not.

58:57.034 --> 58:58.534
It's not silly.

59:01.038 --> 59:02.538
Actually, um...

59:03.857 --> 59:05.207
I have to tell you something.

59:09.362 --> 59:12.381
Um, I know northbound elf.

59:14.534 --> 59:18.554
Yeah, it was an important part
of my childhood too.

59:18.705 --> 59:22.224
It inspired six degrees
a little.

59:22.451 --> 59:25.285
I guess what I'm trying
to say is,

59:25.304 --> 59:28.730
When you talk about
how important it is to you,

59:28.882 --> 59:30.399
I understand.

59:34.220 --> 59:36.387
- Why didn't you tell me this?

59:37.575 --> 59:40.075
- Well, I suppose I didn't see
you as an ally at first.

59:44.731 --> 59:47.165
I mean, why would I share
that part of myself with you?

59:50.421 --> 59:52.254
- I can understand that.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.999
But you know, for somebody
who has a lot to say

59:56.093 --> 59:58.318
About human connection,
you sure do keep a lot

59:58.411 --> 1:00:00.095
About yourself under lockdown.

1:00:01.824 --> 1:00:03.932
- Might be something
I have to work on, I guess.

1:00:04.159 --> 1:00:05.767
(chuckling)

1:00:06.995 --> 1:00:09.496
So, mr. Big tech entrepreneur

1:00:09.514 --> 1:00:12.590
Who, you know, occasionally
burns batches of cookies.

1:00:12.684 --> 1:00:14.109
(laughing)
um...

1:00:15.595 --> 1:00:17.929
What do you say we have
a little fun?

1:00:18.023 --> 1:00:19.948
(soft holiday music)

1:00:21.193 --> 1:00:23.844
- So, roller-skating, huh?

1:00:23.937 --> 1:00:26.529
Not ice skating?
Isn't that more seasonal?

1:00:26.682 --> 1:00:30.608
- Well, this is indoors,
therefore, anytime.

1:00:32.020 --> 1:00:34.371
You know, I used to skate around
this store when I was younger,

1:00:34.523 --> 1:00:35.964
But then I remembered this place

1:00:36.116 --> 1:00:38.541
And that you have
nighttime access.

1:00:38.694 --> 1:00:40.952
(chuckling)
- I see.

1:00:40.971 --> 1:00:43.972
- We can skate through a forest
of christmas trees.

1:00:44.808 --> 1:00:46.475
- Sparkltrees.

1:00:46.626 --> 1:00:49.386
(chuckling)
- yeah, sparkltrees.

1:00:49.538 --> 1:00:51.313
- We should play some music.

1:00:51.540 --> 1:00:53.723
Sparkltree comes with
a free app

1:00:53.817 --> 1:00:56.393
Featuring such things
as tree care instructions

1:00:56.487 --> 1:00:58.487
And such playlists as

1:00:58.714 --> 1:01:00.489
"music to open presents to."
- ooh.

1:01:00.716 --> 1:01:01.898
- "dancing around
the christmas tree."

1:01:01.992 --> 1:01:02.974
- Mm-hmm.

1:01:02.993 --> 1:01:05.243
- "falling in love
at christmas."

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:08.413
- You should save
that one for zoey.

1:01:18.676 --> 1:01:20.083
Okay.

1:01:20.235 --> 1:01:21.918
So, I know this
is supposed to be

1:01:22.070 --> 1:01:23.679
A stress-relieving activity,

1:01:23.830 --> 1:01:26.589
So I promise not to make fun
of you if you wobble,

1:01:26.684 --> 1:01:28.684
As long as you promise

1:01:28.911 --> 1:01:30.668
Not to make fun of my wobbles.
Yeah?

1:01:30.762 --> 1:01:32.521
- Deal.
- Deal.

1:01:34.024 --> 1:01:35.415
- I can see why you would make
assumptions about me

1:01:35.508 --> 1:01:37.918
Given that I am
a techie-numbers guy.

1:01:38.011 --> 1:01:40.937
- Mm-hmm.
- And by numbers guy I mean...

1:01:41.924 --> 1:01:44.116
...Number one skater
in the entire lobby.

1:01:45.444 --> 1:01:48.186
Whew.
- What?!

1:01:48.205 --> 1:01:49.930
You tricked me.

1:01:50.023 --> 1:01:53.041
- You underestimated me.
- Seems I have.

1:01:53.544 --> 1:01:56.360
(upbeat music)

1:01:56.455 --> 1:01:57.879
Okay.
(laughing)

1:01:58.031 --> 1:02:00.198
Okay, what you got then?
- Yeah?

1:02:00.292 --> 1:02:02.050
Come on, here we go.

1:02:02.277 --> 1:02:03.885
There we go.

1:02:06.206 --> 1:02:07.723
There you go, there you go.

1:02:08.559 --> 1:02:11.059
- Whew!
(laughing)

1:02:13.897 --> 1:02:15.880
Go on, then.
- I'll spin around ya.

1:02:15.974 --> 1:02:18.475
- Yeah?
- Whew!

1:02:18.569 --> 1:02:20.986
(laughing)

1:02:22.481 --> 1:02:25.157
- Oh!
(laughing)

1:02:32.232 --> 1:02:34.583
Ah!
(laughing)

1:02:35.735 --> 1:02:36.977
Are you happy?

1:02:36.995 --> 1:02:38.503
(laughing)

1:02:42.317 --> 1:02:44.593
<i> (radio host): Happy holidays!</i>

1:02:44.744 --> 1:02:48.096
<i> We hope you enjoyed this music</i>
<i> along with your sparkltree,</i>

1:02:48.323 --> 1:02:51.016
<i> And that you sparkle</i>
<i> all the way.</i>

1:02:52.160 --> 1:02:53.769
(soft music)

1:02:53.996 --> 1:02:56.605
- I wanted your opinion
on something

1:02:56.832 --> 1:02:58.774
As a potential
sparkltree customer.

1:03:00.335 --> 1:03:03.094
- Okay, not even a potential
sparkltree customer,

1:03:03.188 --> 1:03:04.613
But how can I help?

1:03:10.621 --> 1:03:12.603
(sighs)

1:03:12.623 --> 1:03:14.438
- I thought we'd do a little
quality control check

1:03:14.458 --> 1:03:15.940
From this angle.

1:03:15.959 --> 1:03:17.684
- Well, this is how
the kids see it.

1:03:17.702 --> 1:03:19.461
- Exactly.
(chuckling)

1:03:20.964 --> 1:03:22.881
- I used to love doing this
when I was a kid.

1:03:24.968 --> 1:03:26.617
So, uh,

1:03:26.637 --> 1:03:29.546
What made you move
towards agriculture?

1:03:29.698 --> 1:03:31.807
What inspired sparkltree?

1:03:33.869 --> 1:03:35.143
- My uncle.

1:03:36.629 --> 1:03:38.963
Yeah, we were always very close.

1:03:38.982 --> 1:03:41.299
In fact, he was the one that
gave me northbound elf

1:03:41.318 --> 1:03:42.901
When I was a kid.

1:03:46.064 --> 1:03:48.139
After my parents passed away
when I was in grad school,

1:03:48.233 --> 1:03:50.492
He became the family that
I would spend christmas with.

1:03:51.887 --> 1:03:54.329
One year, I visited him
on christmas eve.

1:03:55.891 --> 1:03:58.241
And I had been working
like crazy,

1:03:58.335 --> 1:04:01.411
He had hurt his back
and he was living alone

1:04:01.563 --> 1:04:03.255
And didn't have
a christmas tree.

1:04:04.324 --> 1:04:05.423
It broke my heart.

1:04:07.252 --> 1:04:09.569
I started thinking, if we can
get everything else delivered,

1:04:09.662 --> 1:04:11.588
Then why not a christmas tree?

1:04:11.682 --> 1:04:14.015
And not just if you live
near a farm, you know?

1:04:15.335 --> 1:04:18.019
So, I partnered
with some farmers

1:04:18.246 --> 1:04:19.762
Who were struggling
to stay in business

1:04:19.915 --> 1:04:22.691
And invited them to participate.

1:04:23.602 --> 1:04:25.026
Worked out well for everyone.

1:04:26.530 --> 1:04:30.365
- What... So, sparkltrees
actually helps the farmers?

1:04:31.351 --> 1:04:32.683
- Yeah, of course.

1:04:32.703 --> 1:04:35.370
I needed their skills
and they were helped by mine.

1:04:37.708 --> 1:04:39.291
- Wow.

1:04:40.936 --> 1:04:43.044
Here I was, being such a...

1:04:44.122 --> 1:04:45.529
Brat...
(chuckling)

1:04:45.624 --> 1:04:47.215
...About everything.

1:04:49.035 --> 1:04:50.293
- It's fine, I'm used
to people jumping

1:04:50.445 --> 1:04:51.887
To the worst conclusions.

1:04:56.376 --> 1:04:58.727
You know, the other beautiful
thing about sparkltree?

1:05:00.972 --> 1:05:02.898
It's extremely profitable
as an untapped part

1:05:03.125 --> 1:05:05.642
Of the christmas market.
- Oh... You--

1:05:05.736 --> 1:05:07.319
(laughing)

1:05:08.964 --> 1:05:10.822
(soft music)

1:05:16.154 --> 1:05:18.163
(phone ringing)

1:05:22.477 --> 1:05:23.919
- It's zoey.

1:05:26.406 --> 1:05:28.906
- Well, that's... That's good.

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.592
That's a good thing.

1:05:34.156 --> 1:05:36.431
We should probably
call it a night.

1:05:42.755 --> 1:05:45.014
- Okay, regarding six degrees,

1:05:45.108 --> 1:05:47.943
And I know I'm supposed
to be on hiatus here.

1:05:51.448 --> 1:05:55.933
I don't know how to explain it,
this feels personal.

1:05:55.953 --> 1:05:58.528
Fun, I mean...

1:05:58.622 --> 1:06:01.030
<i> It feels like a field trip.</i>
<i> I don't know.</i>

1:06:01.183 --> 1:06:03.533
- Okay, do you want me
to have leon start

1:06:03.627 --> 1:06:04.867
Printing you out the paperwork?
- Yes, but not

1:06:04.962 --> 1:06:06.519
The typical paperwork.

1:06:06.538 --> 1:06:08.521
I'd like to get the copyright
process started,

1:06:08.614 --> 1:06:10.190
Fast-tracked out if possible.

1:06:10.283 --> 1:06:11.691
<i> - So, we are looking</i>
<i> at a takeover?</i>

1:06:11.784 --> 1:06:15.044
- No. No, no, no.
This is just protective.

1:06:15.197 --> 1:06:17.455
And find a team of coders
looking to make

1:06:17.549 --> 1:06:18.974
<i> Some holiday pay.</i>

1:06:19.201 --> 1:06:22.477
- I'll also keep trying to track
down copies of northbound elf.

1:06:22.704 --> 1:06:24.037
Is it okay for me
to use your handle

1:06:24.130 --> 1:06:25.296
To really get it out there?

1:06:25.390 --> 1:06:26.982
<i> - Yeah, of course.</i>

1:06:27.876 --> 1:06:29.150
Although...

1:06:32.472 --> 1:06:34.239
...May have a better angle.

1:06:36.218 --> 1:06:37.826
Hmm.

1:06:41.498 --> 1:06:43.389
- I couldn't help but notice
that your dad's

1:06:43.483 --> 1:06:46.059
Molasses spiced cookies
are trending.

1:06:46.077 --> 1:06:47.243
- What?

1:06:47.337 --> 1:06:52.007
Oh, yeah jason had this
fundraiser emergency,

1:06:52.234 --> 1:06:56.069
So I convinced him
to bake himself.

1:06:56.087 --> 1:06:58.179
It was fun

1:06:58.406 --> 1:07:00.573
Watching him try to work
a rolling pin.

1:07:00.592 --> 1:07:05.503
- Oh, is this part of the deal
or a distraction tactic?

1:07:05.597 --> 1:07:08.189
- No, it just sort of happened.

1:07:10.602 --> 1:07:13.028
I'm letting him help me
with six degrees.

1:07:14.680 --> 1:07:16.422
- You must really trust him.

1:07:16.441 --> 1:07:18.033
- I do.

1:07:19.611 --> 1:07:21.786
I just wish he had a reason
to trust me back.

1:07:22.855 --> 1:07:25.373
I wish I'd come clean earlier.

1:07:25.525 --> 1:07:28.859
Now I'm in this... Pickle,

1:07:28.953 --> 1:07:30.628
As you like to say.

1:07:32.532 --> 1:07:34.791
It turns out jason sparks
is a...

1:07:34.885 --> 1:07:36.217
Is a good guy.

1:07:37.612 --> 1:07:39.888
Earnestly looking
for something real.

1:07:42.133 --> 1:07:44.059
- What if he has found it?

1:07:45.545 --> 1:07:47.812
With the real miss santa #1?

1:07:48.973 --> 1:07:50.973
What if you went ahead
and told him?

1:07:51.068 --> 1:07:55.403
- No. If I told him,
he'd be mad, and upset.

1:07:56.464 --> 1:07:58.573
And it would ruin
things for everyone.

1:07:58.724 --> 1:08:02.077
Him, me, and zoey.

1:08:02.304 --> 1:08:04.412
And I still have dani
to think of.

1:08:05.807 --> 1:08:08.065
You know, what if this journey
of his is...

1:08:08.085 --> 1:08:09.751
Is just a phase?

1:08:09.978 --> 1:08:12.069
You know,
like I originally thought.

1:08:12.089 --> 1:08:14.905
- Looks like you have thought
of all the possible

1:08:14.925 --> 1:08:16.816
Bad outcomes.

1:08:16.909 --> 1:08:19.152
- Which is the sensible thing.

1:08:19.245 --> 1:08:21.596
No, I think that this is best.

1:08:22.933 --> 1:08:24.933
It means the least number
of people get hurt.

1:08:26.661 --> 1:08:29.679
Either way, he'll fall so in
love with zoey it won't matter.

1:08:29.773 --> 1:08:31.681
Or...

1:08:31.833 --> 1:08:34.859
He'll forget and move on
to the next thing.

1:08:35.761 --> 1:08:37.946
- What about your feelings?

1:08:39.098 --> 1:08:40.448
- I'll get past it.

1:08:42.602 --> 1:08:44.702
I have a lot
that's good in life.

1:08:47.124 --> 1:08:49.124
(birds chirping)

1:08:49.351 --> 1:08:51.200
- ...That your book,
northbound elf,

1:08:51.353 --> 1:08:54.370
Meant the world
to me when I was young,

1:08:54.464 --> 1:08:57.190
And recently came back
into my life in a very...

1:08:57.283 --> 1:08:59.692
Auspicious and unexpected way.

1:08:59.785 --> 1:09:02.119
I have searched high and low

1:09:02.213 --> 1:09:04.547
And I am astounded at how hard
it is to find a copy,

1:09:04.641 --> 1:09:06.123
And I recently discovered
it's been out of print

1:09:06.143 --> 1:09:07.367
Since the 90s?

1:09:07.385 --> 1:09:08.701
- It wasn't a big seller.

1:09:08.794 --> 1:09:10.311
- Well, let me tell you
from experience,

1:09:10.463 --> 1:09:12.372
The world was missing out.

1:09:12.465 --> 1:09:15.466
Now, I'm somebody
who's fortunate enough

1:09:15.485 --> 1:09:18.153
To be in a position
to bring it back.

1:09:18.989 --> 1:09:21.639
And it's actually
gaining momentum

1:09:21.733 --> 1:09:24.217
Since I posted about it online.

1:09:24.310 --> 1:09:25.994
Here, have a look at this.

1:09:26.221 --> 1:09:28.496
You're trending.
Do you believe that?

1:09:31.743 --> 1:09:34.169
Is this something you might
consider bringing back to life?

1:09:35.005 --> 1:09:36.229
(sighs)

1:09:36.322 --> 1:09:38.564
- This offer's come up before.

1:09:38.658 --> 1:09:40.917
And from what I understand,

1:09:41.069 --> 1:09:43.586
Republishing isn't fiscally
advantageous

1:09:43.738 --> 1:09:45.847
Unless a substantial
part of it is digital.

1:09:46.074 --> 1:09:49.409
And that just
doesn't feel right.

1:09:49.502 --> 1:09:52.078
- I was thinking, print only,

1:09:52.171 --> 1:09:55.523
Hard back,
for that exact same reason.

1:09:58.102 --> 1:10:00.253
- I'm trending, am I?
- Yes, you are.

1:10:00.271 --> 1:10:01.529
(laughing)

1:10:05.276 --> 1:10:06.451
(soft music)

1:10:08.872 --> 1:10:12.265
- Gosh, thanks for walking me
all this way.

1:10:12.358 --> 1:10:14.784
You're like a real... Gentleman.

1:10:14.878 --> 1:10:16.377
(laughing)

1:10:16.604 --> 1:10:18.028
This is me.

1:10:18.048 --> 1:10:19.772
- Yes, I know.

1:10:19.791 --> 1:10:22.608
I was here the other night,
baking up a storm.

1:10:22.627 --> 1:10:24.293
- Harper helped you
with that bake sale?

1:10:24.387 --> 1:10:25.962
- Yeah.

1:10:26.114 --> 1:10:28.223
- And this whole time I thought
you came with cooking skills.

1:10:28.450 --> 1:10:29.724
(chuckling)

1:10:29.951 --> 1:10:31.226
- Guess I usually hire
people for that.

1:10:32.637 --> 1:10:34.637
So, um,

1:10:34.731 --> 1:10:36.046
I'll see you tomorrow?

1:10:36.066 --> 1:10:37.623
Christmas eve?

1:10:37.642 --> 1:10:39.734
- I'd like that.
- Okay.

1:10:42.239 --> 1:10:44.405
(sighs)

1:10:45.633 --> 1:10:47.909
(soft music)

1:11:04.652 --> 1:11:06.261
- It's you.

1:11:06.412 --> 1:11:09.489
- Yeah, hi.
- Ah.

1:11:09.582 --> 1:11:11.657
- Oh wait, are you leonard?

1:11:11.751 --> 1:11:13.493
- I certainly am.
- No way,

1:11:13.511 --> 1:11:16.162
We were just talking about you.
That's so crazy.

1:11:16.255 --> 1:11:17.680
You're like cupid, you know?

1:11:17.774 --> 1:11:19.849
You know, part of
the six degrees of santa chain

1:11:19.943 --> 1:11:21.943
That brought us together.
- Guilty as charged.

1:11:23.171 --> 1:11:24.946
You know, I figured
that out also.

1:11:25.173 --> 1:11:27.931
You know, I follow you
on social media.

1:11:27.951 --> 1:11:30.176
- Yeah? Oh.
- My son works in tech

1:11:30.269 --> 1:11:33.454
So I gotta stay up on things,
you know?

1:11:33.681 --> 1:11:35.848
I saw the pictures
of the two of you

1:11:35.941 --> 1:11:38.017
And the post about
the northbound elf.

1:11:38.110 --> 1:11:40.520
I put two and two together.

1:11:40.538 --> 1:11:42.630
Santa #2.

1:11:42.782 --> 1:11:46.876
I'm glad you found each other,
but you better treat her right,

1:11:47.028 --> 1:11:48.711
Because she's one
of the good ones.

1:11:48.863 --> 1:11:50.788
And her daughter too. So sweet.

1:11:50.807 --> 1:11:53.366
- Wait, daughter?

1:11:54.218 --> 1:11:56.060
- Yeah.
- Who are you talking about?

1:11:57.147 --> 1:11:59.555
- Uh, harper
and her daughter dani.

1:11:59.707 --> 1:12:02.224
- Oh, yeah, no. Wrong person.

1:12:02.319 --> 1:12:04.877
So, uh, harper started
six degrees of santa,

1:12:04.896 --> 1:12:07.897
But the original santa
in our chain was zoey.

1:12:08.049 --> 1:12:12.810
- Okay, I hate to quibble,
but I'm positive.

1:12:12.829 --> 1:12:17.481
Yeah, harper mcnevin,
santa #1 in 32a,

1:12:17.500 --> 1:12:20.918
Left northbound elf
in my car right here.

1:12:22.230 --> 1:12:24.672
(soft music)

1:12:41.265 --> 1:12:43.274
(phone ringing)

1:12:58.282 --> 1:13:00.541
(phone ringing)

1:13:10.962 --> 1:13:11.794
(laughing)

1:13:11.946 --> 1:13:14.138
(phone ringing)
- one sec.

1:13:16.134 --> 1:13:17.950
Hello.
<i> - Hey.</i>

1:13:17.969 --> 1:13:20.953
Harper, it's elliott,
jason spark's assistant.

1:13:21.046 --> 1:13:22.622
- Yeah, I know who you are.

1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:25.808
Um, merry christmas eve eve.
(chuckling)

1:13:25.902 --> 1:13:28.794
<i> - Sorry, I'm just a little</i>
<i> out of sorts.</i>

1:13:28.888 --> 1:13:31.964
Uh... I'm calling because...

1:13:31.983 --> 1:13:33.799
Have you by chance spoken
to jason at all today?

1:13:33.818 --> 1:13:35.301
- To jason?

1:13:35.394 --> 1:13:37.987
No, no, we haven't spoken
since yesterday.

1:13:38.139 --> 1:13:39.664
<i> Maybe he's with zoey.</i>

1:13:41.993 --> 1:13:44.977
- Well, I haven't been able
to reach him all evening,

1:13:44.996 --> 1:13:48.739
Which is unusual, so,
I just started to worry.

1:13:48.758 --> 1:13:51.759
Um, if you happen to see him,
can you just tell him

1:13:51.911 --> 1:13:53.911
I have a few important updates
on the six degrees domain?

1:13:54.005 --> 1:13:57.006
<i> Also, he'll definitely be able</i>
<i> to fast-track securing</i>

1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:58.824
<i> The copyright, so,</i>
<i> no need to worry about--</i>

1:13:58.918 --> 1:14:02.161
- Wait, copyright?
From my six degrees?

1:14:02.180 --> 1:14:03.512
- That's the one.

1:14:03.606 --> 1:14:04.939
<i> Unless there's two?</i>

1:14:05.166 --> 1:14:07.166
- No, I never agreed
to any of that.

1:14:07.259 --> 1:14:09.110
I can't believe that jason...

1:14:11.614 --> 1:14:13.281
(sighs)

1:14:14.509 --> 1:14:16.701
(soft music)

1:14:21.683 --> 1:14:22.865
- Harper...

1:14:22.959 --> 1:14:24.775
- So, I guess you're just
gonna do whatever you want

1:14:24.869 --> 1:14:26.294
With six degrees?

1:14:27.689 --> 1:14:28.704
- What are you talking about?

1:14:28.856 --> 1:14:31.357
- Well, elliott called me,
looking for you,

1:14:31.375 --> 1:14:33.951
And I guess, well,
he let the cat out of the bag.

1:14:33.970 --> 1:14:37.379
Something about
copyright and six degrees.

1:14:37.474 --> 1:14:40.199
- Wait, look, I know this
may look bad, but it's--

1:14:40.292 --> 1:14:42.459
- No, I just don't know
what's worse.

1:14:42.479 --> 1:14:44.537
If this was part of your plan
all along

1:14:44.630 --> 1:14:46.706
Or if you just couldn't
help yourself.

1:14:46.724 --> 1:14:48.816
I thought we made a deal.

1:14:49.652 --> 1:14:51.877
- Did we have a deal?

1:14:52.972 --> 1:14:55.639
You mean the deal where
you help me find miss santa #1

1:14:55.658 --> 1:14:57.383
And then I help you
with your shop

1:14:57.476 --> 1:14:58.993
And leave your site alone?

1:15:00.388 --> 1:15:02.479
Well, you didn't hold up
your end of the deal.

1:15:02.499 --> 1:15:04.332
So it looks like
we're in a grey area.

1:15:04.559 --> 1:15:05.891
- Grey area?

1:15:05.985 --> 1:15:08.151
No, I connected you to zoey,

1:15:08.171 --> 1:15:10.004
I did my part,
and I found your...

1:15:10.231 --> 1:15:11.672
Your person.

1:15:13.492 --> 1:15:15.176
- That's not who you found.

1:15:17.329 --> 1:15:19.680
I know zoey is not
miss santa #1.

1:15:26.914 --> 1:15:30.191
- Okay, yeah, um, you're right.

1:15:32.195 --> 1:15:33.528
I'm sorry.

1:15:35.365 --> 1:15:37.198
- Is there anything else
you'd like to confess?

1:15:40.261 --> 1:15:42.036
- Yeah, it's just,
the thing is...

1:15:44.040 --> 1:15:47.208
Um, I thought that
you and zoey...

1:15:49.937 --> 1:15:52.213
I meant to tell you
that it wasn't her.

1:15:53.866 --> 1:15:56.959
But then it seemed that you guys
might be good for each other

1:15:57.053 --> 1:15:59.804
And... I didn't want
to interfere with that.

1:16:02.559 --> 1:16:04.466
- And...

1:16:04.619 --> 1:16:07.228
You needed me to hold up
my end of the deal.

1:16:07.897 --> 1:16:10.565
- Yeah. Yeah.

1:16:10.792 --> 1:16:12.716
I needed help
with the paper company

1:16:12.735 --> 1:16:14.986
And I wanted you to leave
six degrees alone.

1:16:16.388 --> 1:16:19.407
- Well, mission accomplished.

1:16:20.743 --> 1:16:22.410
You don't have to worry
about six degrees.

1:16:28.251 --> 1:16:29.667
I think you should go.

1:16:35.316 --> 1:16:39.760
- You know, I know I may not
have been on all the up and up.

1:16:41.598 --> 1:16:43.598
But zoey's great.

1:16:45.493 --> 1:16:47.602
And I think you deserve
someone great too.

1:17:00.617 --> 1:17:01.949
(city hubbub)

1:17:04.345 --> 1:17:05.620
- Ooh.

1:17:07.957 --> 1:17:11.016
Ooh.
- Ah.

1:17:11.035 --> 1:17:12.793
Another one for the books.

1:17:14.446 --> 1:17:17.539
What are you so absorbed in?

1:17:17.634 --> 1:17:19.634
- I'm just getting more and more
of these emails

1:17:19.861 --> 1:17:22.136
From six degrees people.
Like, look!

1:17:22.363 --> 1:17:24.472
"thank you for
the christmas magic."

1:17:24.699 --> 1:17:27.883
<i> "konichiwa</i>
from six degrees kyoto,

1:17:28.035 --> 1:17:29.644
Please tell my santa #1

1:17:29.795 --> 1:17:31.646
That their gift
changed my life."

1:17:32.982 --> 1:17:35.207
I'm seeing now that
there's such a yearning

1:17:35.226 --> 1:17:36.984
To connect to each other.

1:17:40.381 --> 1:17:42.990
Am I limiting the joy
of this project?

1:17:43.142 --> 1:17:45.576
Maybe jason was right.

1:17:46.888 --> 1:17:48.387
- I thought he was helping you.

1:17:48.406 --> 1:17:50.055
(sighs)

1:17:50.149 --> 1:17:51.999
- I wasn't really letting him.

1:17:53.577 --> 1:17:56.912
We had a big fight.

1:17:57.064 --> 1:17:59.507
And mostly because I was trying

1:17:59.734 --> 1:18:02.343
To protect six degrees,
you know? And for what?

1:18:03.328 --> 1:18:04.679
It just seems so silly now.

1:18:07.742 --> 1:18:10.851
Now I've missed out
on two great things.

1:18:15.841 --> 1:18:18.192
- I tell you what
I won't miss out on...

1:18:19.420 --> 1:18:21.696
That holiday casserole of yours.

1:18:23.090 --> 1:18:24.773
(chuckling)
come on, let's get packed up.

1:18:24.867 --> 1:18:26.200
- Okay.

1:18:27.870 --> 1:18:30.454
(jazzy music)

1:18:32.450 --> 1:18:34.950
- And that's how I found out
that you were not santa #1.

1:18:35.044 --> 1:18:36.285
(sighs)

1:18:36.379 --> 1:18:39.271
- It feels good to have
this weight off my chest.

1:18:39.364 --> 1:18:43.442
Also, I'm so sorry about taking
advantage of your social media.

1:18:44.295 --> 1:18:47.054
But I gotta say,
it's been life-changing.

1:18:47.206 --> 1:18:48.889
- It's no problem, really.

1:18:49.116 --> 1:18:50.891
And I can keep that up,
it's easy.

1:18:53.062 --> 1:18:54.878
(clears throat)

1:18:54.972 --> 1:18:56.063
- You seem off.

1:18:56.974 --> 1:18:58.566
Is everything okay?

1:18:58.793 --> 1:19:00.651
I mean, the past week
of lies aside.

1:19:03.965 --> 1:19:06.056
- I know harper
is miss santa #1.

1:19:06.075 --> 1:19:09.076
- What?! No way!

1:19:12.156 --> 1:19:12.913
I know.

1:19:16.811 --> 1:19:18.085
Now all the weight's
off my chest.

1:19:18.312 --> 1:19:20.421
(chuckling)

1:19:21.758 --> 1:19:23.758
To be fair, we were all
knotted up about it.

1:19:24.835 --> 1:19:27.319
At some point,
we just found ourselves

1:19:27.412 --> 1:19:28.670
At this point of no return.

1:19:28.765 --> 1:19:30.014
- Mm-hmm.

1:19:34.328 --> 1:19:36.829
Elliott, what are you doing
here?

1:19:36.922 --> 1:19:38.606
- I am so sorry to interrupt.

1:19:38.833 --> 1:19:41.667
I saw this reservation
in your calendar

1:19:41.685 --> 1:19:44.278
And you haven't been answering
the phone so I started to worry

1:19:44.505 --> 1:19:46.947
But I, uh...

1:19:48.025 --> 1:19:49.617
...Suppose I can see why.

1:19:50.936 --> 1:19:53.103
I wanted to make sure
you were alive,

1:19:53.122 --> 1:19:56.773
And if you were alive,
which you are,

1:19:56.867 --> 1:20:00.536
To tell you that I think
I messed things up with harper.

1:20:00.630 --> 1:20:03.705
I called her to see
if she'd heard from you

1:20:03.800 --> 1:20:05.448
And I didn't know
I wasn't supposed to bring up

1:20:05.468 --> 1:20:07.359
The copyright.

1:20:07.378 --> 1:20:09.720
- It's quite alright.
It doesn't matter anymore.

1:20:10.973 --> 1:20:12.881
Zoey, this is my executive
assistant elliott.

1:20:12.975 --> 1:20:14.642
Elliott, this is zoey.

1:20:16.370 --> 1:20:18.145
Please, have a seat. Join us.

1:20:20.149 --> 1:20:22.817
- I thought it was the book that
was supposed to be a secret.

1:20:24.469 --> 1:20:27.379
- Oh, no, it was supposed to be
a secret from her, wasn't it?

1:20:27.398 --> 1:20:28.989
- No, no. Harper.

1:20:30.551 --> 1:20:32.326
I'm having northbound elf
republished in hardback

1:20:32.553 --> 1:20:33.719
For harper.

1:20:33.812 --> 1:20:35.830
- Wait, it wasn't for zoey?

1:20:36.833 --> 1:20:38.648
(scoffs)

1:20:38.668 --> 1:20:40.501
(jason): Uh, no.

1:20:41.912 --> 1:20:44.487
(soft music)

1:20:44.582 --> 1:20:46.915
In the end, harper deceived me,

1:20:47.068 --> 1:20:50.419
But it led to you,
me and zoey here

1:20:50.571 --> 1:20:52.179
On this lovely date right now.

1:20:53.015 --> 1:20:55.424
- But, let's face it,

1:20:55.518 --> 1:20:57.334
I'm not the person
you're supposed to be with.

1:20:57.428 --> 1:20:59.928
- No, no, you are.

1:21:00.022 --> 1:21:02.189
- You're falling in love
with her, aren't you?

1:21:04.360 --> 1:21:07.027
You are falling
in love with harper!

1:21:08.439 --> 1:21:10.255
You and I meant well,
but we have terrible chemistry.

1:21:10.349 --> 1:21:12.107
And northbound elf
did nothing for me.

1:21:12.201 --> 1:21:13.850
(sighs)

1:21:13.870 --> 1:21:15.452
Now all the weight's
off my chest.

1:21:16.263 --> 1:21:17.204
- I'm...

1:21:19.100 --> 1:21:20.449
...Falling in love with harper.

1:21:20.601 --> 1:21:22.877
- Oh! Harper's fantastic.

1:21:23.028 --> 1:21:24.879
I've been trying to get her
to open herself up to dating

1:21:25.106 --> 1:21:26.455
For so long.

1:21:26.549 --> 1:21:28.624
You two would be adorbs.

1:21:28.776 --> 1:21:30.609
- And he's actually
double in love with her,

1:21:30.628 --> 1:21:33.370
First as miss santa #1,
and now in real life.

1:21:33.389 --> 1:21:35.890
- Great point, elliott.
(chuckling)

1:21:37.894 --> 1:21:39.894
So, what happens now?

1:21:40.730 --> 1:21:41.729
- Nothing.

1:21:42.881 --> 1:21:44.648
She doesn't feel the same way.

1:21:46.310 --> 1:21:48.569
She went to the end of the earth
to keep me from finding out...

1:21:50.072 --> 1:21:52.573
She was the person
I was actually looking for.

1:21:52.724 --> 1:21:55.225
- Well, do you think she knows
how you feel about her?

1:21:55.244 --> 1:21:57.077
What about the republication,
how did that go over?

1:21:57.304 --> 1:21:59.163
- It hasn't yet,
I haven't had ti...

1:22:02.159 --> 1:22:04.067
(soft music)

1:22:04.086 --> 1:22:05.068
I've gotta go.

1:22:05.162 --> 1:22:06.921
Um, thank you both.

1:22:07.998 --> 1:22:10.925
Elliott, you stay.

1:22:12.153 --> 1:22:13.152
Yeah.

1:22:13.170 --> 1:22:15.095
Dinner's on me.

1:22:15.322 --> 1:22:17.598
- Uh...
- Okay you kids, gotta go.

1:22:18.659 --> 1:22:20.100
- Good luck! Merry christmas!

1:22:20.327 --> 1:22:21.769
(chuckling)

1:22:23.755 --> 1:22:25.606
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1:22:25.833 --> 1:22:26.857
(chuckling)

1:22:30.688 --> 1:22:31.853
(sighs)
- hey.

1:22:31.948 --> 1:22:33.447
- Hey.

1:22:35.267 --> 1:22:36.842
Sylvia's wonderful, derrick.

1:22:36.935 --> 1:22:39.511
- I'm partial to her myself.

1:22:39.530 --> 1:22:40.454
(chuckling)

1:22:40.681 --> 1:22:42.373
How are things going
with santa claus?

1:22:44.293 --> 1:22:46.351
- It didn't work out.

1:22:46.445 --> 1:22:49.296
And I think it's for the better.

1:22:51.709 --> 1:22:55.636
- So, uh, I'm to assume
that you headed it off.

1:22:56.714 --> 1:22:58.380
And I guess it's safe to assume

1:22:58.532 --> 1:23:00.808
That dani's at least
part of your excuse?

1:23:03.628 --> 1:23:06.129
Because the thing
about dani is...

1:23:06.148 --> 1:23:07.564
She's growing up.

1:23:09.210 --> 1:23:11.318
She's getting wiser,
more perceptive.

1:23:11.470 --> 1:23:12.802
Listen, at some point,

1:23:12.896 --> 1:23:15.047
It will be less about
protecting her and more about

1:23:15.065 --> 1:23:16.973
Setting a good example.

1:23:16.993 --> 1:23:19.493
Hey, remember that big fight
we got into in college?

1:23:19.644 --> 1:23:21.811
And that big gesture
that I made,

1:23:21.905 --> 1:23:24.223
Singing to you from your window
of our biology class,

1:23:24.241 --> 1:23:25.815
Remember that?
- Yes.

1:23:25.909 --> 1:23:27.835
- Right.
Well, I've been outdone.

1:23:29.654 --> 1:23:31.063
Santa claus posted something

1:23:31.156 --> 1:23:32.673
That I think you might
be interested in.

1:23:34.902 --> 1:23:36.251
Press play.

1:23:36.403 --> 1:23:38.237
Yeah.

1:23:38.255 --> 1:23:40.848
<i> - I'd say it's less</i>
<i> of a business venture</i>

1:23:40.999 --> 1:23:44.101
<i> And more of a gift to someone</i>
<i> very important to me.</i>

1:23:45.521 --> 1:23:47.929
Because northbound elf
is very special to her too.

1:23:49.341 --> 1:23:52.417
<i> It's a book about finding home</i>
<i> where you least suspect it.</i>

1:23:53.087 --> 1:23:54.862
<i> And I found home with her.</i>

1:23:56.257 --> 1:23:57.606
(soft music)

1:23:57.700 --> 1:23:59.091
(gasps)

1:23:59.109 --> 1:24:00.367
- Oh...

1:24:01.779 --> 1:24:03.779
I... I've gotta go.

1:24:03.873 --> 1:24:05.706
(chuckles)

1:24:07.710 --> 1:24:09.209
(door opening)

1:24:10.713 --> 1:24:12.120
- Hi.

1:24:12.214 --> 1:24:13.714
- Hey.

1:24:15.793 --> 1:24:18.886
Is this for zoey?

1:24:20.281 --> 1:24:24.725
- No, actually,
it's for miss santa #1.

1:24:26.228 --> 1:24:29.971
Thought it would remind her
of her favourite part

1:24:30.066 --> 1:24:32.066
Of her favourite book.

1:24:36.463 --> 1:24:37.738
- It is.

1:24:39.057 --> 1:24:41.224
- I'm sorry that
it's not fully wrapped,

1:24:41.318 --> 1:24:43.802
I ran out of wrapping paper
and my favourite paper store

1:24:43.821 --> 1:24:45.412
Was closed early today.

1:24:46.990 --> 1:24:49.917
- I just saw your post.

1:24:50.144 --> 1:24:52.402
- It was...

1:24:52.421 --> 1:24:54.313
I was inspired.

1:24:54.331 --> 1:24:55.339
(sighs)

1:24:58.168 --> 1:25:01.486
I need you to know that
I was not after six degrees.

1:25:01.505 --> 1:25:04.506
I wanted to secure a copyright
but I wanted to do it for you,

1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:06.508
To protect your idea.

1:25:06.660 --> 1:25:08.102
And...

1:25:09.921 --> 1:25:13.181
I also included a prototype.

1:25:13.275 --> 1:25:15.776
You can think of it as
a type of scaffolding.

1:25:16.003 --> 1:25:19.338
And you can go in there,
and play around,

1:25:19.431 --> 1:25:21.115
And change things if you want.

1:25:21.342 --> 1:25:23.525
Or nothing at all,
it's up to you.

1:25:23.619 --> 1:25:25.193
But, um...

1:25:25.346 --> 1:25:28.622
I was just hoping
that we could be partners.

1:25:32.519 --> 1:25:34.277
- I...

1:25:34.296 --> 1:25:37.548
I think you were right
about opening up six degrees

1:25:38.634 --> 1:25:40.692
And...

1:25:40.785 --> 1:25:42.636
I want to do that with you.

1:25:44.198 --> 1:25:47.382
I thought I was protecting it,
but I was actually

1:25:47.534 --> 1:25:49.977
Holding it back
from so much potential.

1:25:51.205 --> 1:25:53.397
I think the same
might go for my heart.

1:25:55.042 --> 1:25:58.377
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
that I was santa #1.

1:25:58.470 --> 1:25:59.987
At first I thought you were

1:26:00.214 --> 1:26:01.563
The last person
in the world for me,

1:26:01.657 --> 1:26:03.064
And then that became
less and less the case

1:26:03.159 --> 1:26:04.883
Until...

1:26:04.976 --> 1:26:06.660
You were the only one for me.

1:26:08.722 --> 1:26:11.165
(soft music)

1:26:25.830 --> 1:26:27.406
- I think this is another
great argument

1:26:27.499 --> 1:26:29.016
For opening up six degrees.

1:26:30.577 --> 1:26:33.187
- I think you might be
right about that, partner.

1:26:33.414 --> 1:26:35.022
(chuckling)

1:26:40.921 --> 1:26:43.864
(soft music)
