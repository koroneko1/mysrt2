01:18.540 --> 01:21.230
Salutations, snack.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.600
On second thought...

01:26.850 --> 01:28.870
9-1-1!

01:29.010 --> 01:31.980
Police! Civic authorities! ASPCA! ASAP!

01:32.080 --> 01:34.680
Murder! Betrayal! Kidnapped!

01:34.820 --> 01:36.450
No, birdnapped!

01:37.620 --> 01:40.420
A cup of garlic, a twist of parakeet.

01:40.530 --> 01:43.020
Eat your heart out, Julia Child.

01:44.100 --> 01:49.590
Excuse me, but isn't it customary
for the jailbird to get one telephone call?

01:50.100 --> 01:51.730
In your case, I think not.

01:51.870 --> 01:54.460
Afternoon snacks have few civil liberties.

01:54.570 --> 01:56.670
But I'm not wholly without heart.

01:57.110 --> 01:59.470
How about a nice soothing cigarette?

02:05.880 --> 02:08.150
Oh, I will not do this. I cannot!

02:08.590 --> 02:12.680
Oh, what a foul way for a bird to die!
I don't want to get beak cancer.

02:13.160 --> 02:15.280
No! My lungs are blackened!

02:15.390 --> 02:18.090
Here we go again.
Cut, cut, cut! Roll it back.

02:18.200 --> 02:20.860
- Help me...
- What are you doing? Daniel...

02:21.000 --> 02:23.870
That line is not in the script.
Why did you add it?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.440
- I wanted to comment on the situation.
- What situation?

02:27.770 --> 02:31.710
Shoving a cigarette into Pudgie's mouth
is morally irresponsible.

02:31.810 --> 02:35.640
This is a cartoon,
not a friggin' Oprah Winfrey Special.

02:35.750 --> 02:39.840
Lou, millions of kids see this cartoon.
It's like telling them "Light up. "

02:39.950 --> 02:43.650
You can't put words in Pudgie's mouth
if his mouth isn't moving.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.380
It's voice-over. An interior monologue.
Maybe even the voice of God.

02:47.630 --> 02:50.530
Pudgie, don't smoke.

02:50.630 --> 02:53.720
- Actors.
- What? Let's ask the technicians.

02:53.830 --> 02:58.000
Do you think it's morally right
to promote smoking to the youth of America?

03:00.810 --> 03:05.740
- They're biased. That's a mistrial.
- This session costs the studio thousands.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.540
If you want a paycheck, stick to the script.

03:08.650 --> 03:12.670
If you want to play Gandhi,
then do it on somebody else's time.

03:18.220 --> 03:21.560
Then I've got to do what I've got to do.

03:21.660 --> 03:24.560
That's very funny.
Where the hell are you goin'?

03:24.660 --> 03:27.290
If you leave, you're not comin' back in.

03:27.400 --> 03:30.330
I'm not takin' any crap from you, pal.

03:30.440 --> 03:33.500
Well, in the words of Porky Pig:

03:36.040 --> 03:38.130
Piss off, Lou.

04:10.510 --> 04:13.340
- So what about that history test?
- Don't ask.

04:13.850 --> 04:18.279
- Did you have fun in school?
- I painted a picture of a rainbow.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.150
- Dad?
- Daddy!

04:24.590 --> 04:26.610
Daddy!

04:30.460 --> 04:34.190
- I thought you couldn't pick us up.
- Well, I got off early.

04:34.300 --> 04:38.790
- You mean you got fired?
- No, I quit. For reasons of conscience.

04:38.900 --> 04:39.870
Actors.

04:40.000 --> 04:46.100
Dude, congratulations on your
12th birthday. Got a surprise for ya.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.300
- A stripper?
- Ooh, please!

04:48.480 --> 04:50.280
- Two strippers?
- Hoo-hah, boy!

04:50.420 --> 04:51.710
- A party?
- Yes!

04:51.850 --> 04:53.870
No. No parties.

04:54.020 --> 04:57.580
Mom said you couldn't have one
because of your report card.

04:57.690 --> 05:02.650
Mom's not gonna be
home for another four hours, is she?

05:04.100 --> 05:08.030
Prepare yourself... for the wild kingdom.

05:28.720 --> 05:32.820
Coming up toward the very end.
There she goes. And she wins that race.

05:32.920 --> 05:34.950
Come on off now. Here we go.

05:36.860 --> 05:38.890
You want to feed him?

05:40.360 --> 05:42.420
See if this guy will.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.900
Sorry.

05:47.310 --> 05:49.330
Get out!

06:15.230 --> 06:19.170
<i>- Gregory, Henderson and Hillard.
- Miranda Hillard, please.</i>

06:21.370 --> 06:26.370
I know what you're going for with these
murals, but perhaps if they weren't so large.

06:26.510 --> 06:29.170
And let's do steel windows, not wood.

06:29.310 --> 06:33.270
Eliminate the Oriental rug.
Let's try an Aubusson carpet.

06:33.420 --> 06:35.890
- More pink than red.
- Good idea.

06:35.990 --> 06:38.010
Union Square Inn. This is better.

06:38.160 --> 06:43.360
More Arts and Crafts. A Dirk Van Erp lamp,
a Stickley chair. Don't be seduced by chintz.

06:43.460 --> 06:46.230
Excuse me. Miranda,
can I speak to you for a minute?

06:46.400 --> 06:48.630
- Yes. Excuse me.
- Certainly.

06:48.770 --> 06:50.790
Just be one minute.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.840
I just got off the phone
with a Stuart Dunmeyer.

06:54.970 --> 06:58.530
- Stuart Dunmeyer?
- He said you were acquaintances.

06:58.640 --> 06:59.940
Stuart Dunmeyer?

07:00.040 --> 07:04.170
He's putting millions into restoring
the old Wellman mansion on Nob Hill.

07:04.280 --> 07:09.240
- He wants to make it into a $500-a-night B&B.
- Yes, I read about it.

07:09.420 --> 07:12.450
- He's been doing very well.
- That's him.

07:12.590 --> 07:16.030
And he specifically asked for you, Miranda.

07:16.160 --> 07:17.720
He did?

07:17.830 --> 07:20.920
- I told him you'd call first thing tomorrow.
- Yes, I will.

07:22.070 --> 07:25.520
Miss Hillard? The operator
has a Gloria Chaney on hold.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.940
- She says it's an emergency.
- Excuse me.

07:30.110 --> 07:31.540
Gloria?

07:44.090 --> 07:46.960
- Oh, my God!
- Is this your residence, ma'am?

07:47.060 --> 07:49.080
Yes, I'm sorry to say it is.

07:49.230 --> 07:53.360
Are you aware it's illegal to possess
barnyard animals in a residential area?

07:53.500 --> 07:57.400
- What if you're married to one?
- We're also responding to a noise violation.

07:57.540 --> 08:01.840
I'm going to respond myself.
I'm awfully sorry about this.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.000
You ate my begonias! God!

08:05.410 --> 08:07.470
Get out of my way!

09:05.940 --> 09:08.460
Miranda! Whassup?

09:08.940 --> 09:11.310
You're home early, girlfriend.

09:11.410 --> 09:13.840
Havin' a birthday in the house.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.510
What the hell is going on around here?

09:16.680 --> 09:19.240
Don't get mad, honey. Listen.

09:19.350 --> 09:24.120
You're home a little early. I was gonna
clean it all up before you got home.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.290
Honey... What are you looking for?

09:31.100 --> 09:33.860
I'd be careful.
That pony had a lot of water.

09:43.110 --> 09:44.870
Party's over.

09:48.510 --> 09:52.110
She called you
and you bust the birthday party. Great!

09:52.220 --> 09:55.910
Don't you dare
make me out to be the monster here, Daniel!

09:56.020 --> 09:58.680
You have all the fun
and I get whatever's left over.

09:58.790 --> 10:03.160
- You chose the career.
- I have no choices here. I have no choices!

10:03.260 --> 10:06.720
Even when I try to do something fun,
you do it ten times bigger!

10:06.830 --> 10:10.530
I bring home a cake and gifts.
You bring the goddamn San Diego Zoo!

10:10.670 --> 10:14.760
- And I have to clean up!
- It's not toxic waste, just a few party plates!

10:14.870 --> 10:17.840
Why am I the only one
that feels there has to be rules?

10:17.980 --> 10:20.310
Why do you always
make me out to be the heavy?

10:20.410 --> 10:23.180
I don't. You do it yourself quite naturally.

10:23.280 --> 10:27.110
- You set me up every time to be the bad guy.
- Oh, lighten up, will ya?

10:27.220 --> 10:31.520
You spend too much time with
those corporate clones you used to despise.

10:31.620 --> 10:34.460
I spend too much time with you, Daniel.
It's over!

10:34.590 --> 10:36.620
It's over.

10:38.460 --> 10:43.330
Come on, Miranda. We've got problems,
but who doesn't? We could work 'em out.

10:43.670 --> 10:47.330
We've been trying to work them out
for 14 years.

10:47.440 --> 10:52.240
Come on, please. Listen.
Maybe we need some help, OK?

10:52.380 --> 10:55.440
Maybe a family therapist
will help us do this together.

10:55.580 --> 10:57.570
It's too late for that.

10:57.680 --> 11:02.240
Well, let's take a vacation with the kids,
as a family. Get you away from work.

11:02.390 --> 11:05.750
You're a different person.
You really are. You're great.

11:05.860 --> 11:09.290
Our problems would be waiting for us
when we got back.

11:09.430 --> 11:12.790
We'll move, and hopefully
our problems won't follow us.

11:12.900 --> 11:15.090
Daniel, please don't joke.

11:16.430 --> 11:18.370
OK.

11:20.100 --> 11:25.040
We've just grown apart. We're different.

11:25.140 --> 11:29.240
- We have nothing in common.
- Oh, sure we do. We love each other.

11:35.490 --> 11:38.580
Come on, Miranda. We love each other.

11:43.290 --> 11:45.320
Don't we?

11:49.570 --> 11:51.630
I want a divorce.

11:53.070 --> 11:55.100
No.

12:01.450 --> 12:04.680
We can't. We're a family. You know?

12:06.550 --> 12:08.610
I'm so sorry.

12:48.430 --> 12:50.480
Yeah, Ma, he told me all about it.

12:51.930 --> 12:53.950
Yeah, Ma. I heard, I heard.

12:55.730 --> 12:58.700
- Well, yeah, he's here.
- No.

12:59.740 --> 13:02.330
Ma, he's not really in the mood to talk.

13:02.440 --> 13:05.900
Yeah, depressed.
I mean, his marriage is ending.

13:06.010 --> 13:10.210
My marriage is not ending.
It's just on hiatus.

13:12.980 --> 13:15.350
Ma, I think he's in a little bit of denial.

13:15.450 --> 13:19.120
No, we're taking good care of
your little boy. Don't worry, Mom.

13:19.220 --> 13:22.560
- Hi, Evelyn. Thanks for the jam.
- She says you're welcome.

13:22.660 --> 13:26.100
That beige concealer.
When are we gettin' more of it?

13:26.200 --> 13:28.820
- Next week.
- You hear that, Ma? Next week.

13:29.030 --> 13:30.730
Wait, hang on.

13:30.830 --> 13:33.560
- Enough already. It's a man.
- How would you know?

13:33.670 --> 13:35.370
Bitch.

13:35.470 --> 13:38.810
No, Ma, not you.
I was talkin' about the dog.

13:39.340 --> 13:42.540
Ma, listen. We got people
waitin' for us on the set.

13:42.650 --> 13:46.410
Oh, yeah. It's a busy life, Ma.
Places to go, faces to paint.

13:47.150 --> 13:49.050
Yeah, I'll tell him, Ma.

13:49.190 --> 13:50.980
Don't worry, I'll tell him.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.560
Yeah. Hold on, Ma.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.730
She wants to know
if you want to come stay with her.

13:55.830 --> 13:59.630
- No way.
- He says he'll think about it, Ma.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.590
I will. All right. I love you, too.

14:02.700 --> 14:04.760
Bye, Ma.

14:05.400 --> 14:10.030
Hey, listen, you know you can always
stay with us just as long as you want.

14:10.170 --> 14:14.540
Thank you, but I'm OK, really.
I mean, this is just a temporary thing.

14:14.650 --> 14:17.380
I know Miranda. It's gonna blow over.

14:22.050 --> 14:27.790
Mr and Mrs Hillard, although these custody
proceedings tend to favor the mother,

14:27.890 --> 14:33.190
we also realize, perhaps now more than
ever, that it is not in a child's best interest

14:33.300 --> 14:36.460
to deprive him or her
of an obviously loving father.

14:38.400 --> 14:44.900
However, since at the present time Mr Hillard
has no place to live and no employment,

14:45.080 --> 14:49.170
it is the court's ruling
to award sole custody to Mrs Hillard.

14:49.280 --> 14:51.510
- Congratulations.
- No.

14:51.650 --> 14:55.180
Mr Hillard will have visitation rights
every Saturday.

14:55.290 --> 14:57.650
- Can't you do something?
- He's made his decision.

14:57.760 --> 15:01.090
Isn't it traditional
to say "I object" or something?

15:01.230 --> 15:02.920
Your Honor, please.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.490
Every Saturday? That's one day a week.

15:06.630 --> 15:08.930
That's not enough.

15:09.070 --> 15:14.230
I have to be with my children. It's not
a question. I have to be with them, sir. Please.

15:14.340 --> 15:17.830
I know it seems like a lot,
but for me it's not enough. Really.

15:17.940 --> 15:22.640
I haven't been away from 'em for more than
one day since the day they were born.

15:22.750 --> 15:26.610
- Mr Hillard, this ruling is only temporary.
- Oh, good.

15:26.720 --> 15:29.880
I will assign a court liaison
to oversee your case.

15:29.990 --> 15:33.290
There will be a continuance
of these proceedings in 90 days.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.330
- I'm giving you three months, Mr Hillard.
- Thank you.

15:36.460 --> 15:41.060
Three months in which to get a job,
keep it and create a suitable home.

15:41.200 --> 15:43.760
If this proves to be a possibility for you,

15:43.900 --> 15:49.700
I will consider a joint-custody arrangement
when we reconvene. We're adjourned.

15:50.810 --> 15:54.640
Well, it looks like there is
a little light at the end of our tunnel.

16:25.340 --> 16:28.680
- That's all my stuff.
- This is all my fault.

16:29.110 --> 16:31.580
God, no. Why would you think that?

16:31.720 --> 16:34.210
I should have never had a birthday, Dad.

16:34.350 --> 16:37.220
- This never would have happened.
- Yes, it would.

16:37.350 --> 16:40.590
It was an accident waiting to happen, OK?

16:40.720 --> 16:43.220
You did nothing wrong. You got that?

16:44.430 --> 16:46.490
OK, gimme five.

16:53.140 --> 16:55.160
You're the man of the house now.

16:55.340 --> 16:57.360
Don't be messy.

16:58.540 --> 17:01.570
- You can't go now.
- Honey, I have to.

17:02.180 --> 17:06.950
<i>We're in the middle of Charlotte's Web.
Who's gonna finish it?</i>

17:07.619 --> 17:10.109
Well, Grandma will finish it for you.

17:12.020 --> 17:17.050
She's not as good. She always skips parts,
and she never does the voices.

17:17.190 --> 17:19.250
She smells funny, too.

17:19.560 --> 17:23.520
That's the formaldehyde.
That's why Granny's so well preserved.

17:24.970 --> 17:27.400
Hey, come here.

17:29.470 --> 17:33.740
It's the same as always.
We just have a really big backyard, OK?

17:33.840 --> 17:36.810
- I love you.
- I love you.

17:40.120 --> 17:44.020
I'll miss you. Saturday comes real quick.

17:45.620 --> 17:48.890
- I'll miss you.
- Ditto.

17:49.490 --> 17:51.220
Oh, Dad...

17:53.600 --> 17:55.620
- Take care of her.
- OK.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.890
Goodbye.

18:05.110 --> 18:07.600
Thanks for the time, warden.

18:12.950 --> 18:15.010
Bye, Dad.

18:35.310 --> 18:38.760
As your court liaison,
I will be looking at two things.

18:38.910 --> 18:43.110
- Your living environment...
- It's more like a habitat, really.

18:44.480 --> 18:49.850
And I will be coming by on Monday
and Friday evenings to inspect it.

18:49.950 --> 18:51.920
Well, I'll put on a chicken.

18:52.720 --> 18:54.780
And there's always the job issue.

18:54.930 --> 19:00.520
This is the nearest employment office. I took
the liberty of making an appointment for you.

19:00.630 --> 19:04.330
- Thank you.
- By the way, do you have any special skills?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.530
Oh, yes. I do.

19:06.640 --> 19:08.660
I do voices.

19:09.170 --> 19:11.370
What do you mean, you do voices?

19:12.180 --> 19:14.580
Well, I do voices.

19:14.710 --> 19:15.610
Yes!

19:15.750 --> 19:18.580
We're looking for intelligent life.
Oops, mistake!

19:18.720 --> 19:21.980
Happy to be in America.
Don't ask for a green card.

19:22.120 --> 19:24.590
I want you in the worst way.

19:24.720 --> 19:28.420
This is certainly a rough meeting.
It's not going very well for me.

19:28.590 --> 19:32.190
Hey, boss, give her a chance.
She's gonna loosen up any moment.

19:32.330 --> 19:36.230
Look at me, Moneypenny.
I want to undo that bow and get to know you.

19:36.370 --> 19:38.800
I'm crazy to make a deal with you!

19:38.940 --> 19:41.770
Nancy and I are still looking for
the other half of my head.

19:41.870 --> 19:45.640
They're doin' it!
I'm sittin' on a gold mine!

19:45.780 --> 19:48.140
Don't make me smack you, sweetheart.

19:48.950 --> 19:51.140
I do a great impression of a hot dog.

19:54.350 --> 19:56.950
Mr Hillard, do you
consider yourself humorous?

19:57.050 --> 19:59.110
I used to.

19:59.220 --> 20:02.350
There was a time when I found myself funny.

20:02.460 --> 20:05.590
But today you have proven me wrong.
Thank you.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.990
Listen, bottom line...

20:10.830 --> 20:14.670
I need to be with my children,
and I'll do anything to do that.

20:14.810 --> 20:16.830
You just tell me what to do.

20:35.090 --> 20:37.420
- Excuse me. You Tony?
- That's me.

20:37.530 --> 20:40.460
Hi. I'm Daniel Hillard, the actor.

20:42.000 --> 20:44.660
Follow me.

20:46.640 --> 20:50.470
Oh, films! Will I be
introducing these movies on air?

20:50.640 --> 20:53.040
- Not exactly.
- What do I do?

20:53.140 --> 20:56.370
You take all these cans.
You box 'em and you ship 'em.

20:56.480 --> 21:00.080
Then you box those cans over there.
Ship them. Then more will come in.

21:00.520 --> 21:03.080
You box those, you ship those.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.250
Any questions?

21:06.420 --> 21:08.480
After you box 'em...?

21:08.630 --> 21:10.820
You ship 'em.

21:10.930 --> 21:12.990
Lots of luck, smartass.

21:16.630 --> 21:19.500
I think I made a friend.

21:25.940 --> 21:28.840
- Miranda.
- Stu!

21:34.180 --> 21:36.620
Hello, Miranda.

21:36.750 --> 21:39.420
- It's been a long time.
- Yes.

21:42.530 --> 21:46.260
Mr Dunmeyer's come by
to look over your sketches.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.230
Let me show you to the conference room.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.170
As you probably know,
the estate was built in 1876.

21:55.310 --> 21:59.770
These sketches are meant to reflect
your desire to have it completely restored.

21:59.910 --> 22:01.880
You look better than ever.

22:01.980 --> 22:07.440
The lobby will resemble a music salon with
inspiration from the French Second Empire.

22:07.550 --> 22:10.450
I was thinking a 17th-century grand piano...

22:10.550 --> 22:14.120
I've been following your career
these past couple of years.

22:14.220 --> 22:19.130
A tufted sofa, a Flemish tapestry,
a brass-bound Regency-style table...

22:19.230 --> 22:22.960
I'd love to get reacquainted. Catch up.

22:24.400 --> 22:26.770
Mantel clocks.

22:26.900 --> 22:29.700
Fringed, upholstered chairs, heavy drapes.

22:29.840 --> 22:32.400
Can we talk? Over dinner, maybe?

22:34.710 --> 22:37.680
Stuart, thank you. I...

22:37.810 --> 22:40.940
I'm at the beginning of a divorce.

22:42.450 --> 22:44.510
It just didn't work out.

22:44.620 --> 22:47.950
- Oh, Miranda, I'm sorry.
- You don't have to say that.

22:48.060 --> 22:52.690
No, really. I mean, I never
held any grudges or anything. I just...

22:52.830 --> 22:56.030
Well, I always hoped you'd find happiness.

22:56.570 --> 22:58.630
Oh, God, that's so nice.

22:58.770 --> 23:03.140
I was just worried my coming in here
might scare you off the project.

23:03.240 --> 23:05.300
No, no. Of course not. I...

23:06.340 --> 23:08.610
I'm a professional. I'm...

23:08.750 --> 23:13.940
I was flattered that you thought of me
after all these years and everything.

23:14.550 --> 23:16.640
Yeah, everything.

23:16.790 --> 23:19.980
Well... Ancient history.

23:20.620 --> 23:22.350
Yeah.

23:27.300 --> 23:30.060
I'm late.
I've got a meeting over at the bank.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.670
Can we talk maybe later in the week?

23:36.810 --> 23:39.570
- Sure.
- Good.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.170
It's good to see you again.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.360
Good, huh?

24:09.010 --> 24:12.570
I know the place
doesn't look like much now, but...

24:12.680 --> 24:15.170
It'll be OK. How do you like it?

24:16.650 --> 24:19.110
- Nice.
- It's OK.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.220
Detestable.

24:22.550 --> 24:24.650
Hey, just give me some time.

24:25.120 --> 24:28.020
I'm not too comfortable
with this new lifestyle.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.020
Neither are we.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.050
I know it's hard, sweetie.

24:34.300 --> 24:36.660
Can't you just tell Mom you're sorry?

24:39.170 --> 24:41.640
Wish I could.

24:41.740 --> 24:44.070
You know, grown-up problems...

24:44.170 --> 24:47.010
They're a little more complicated, Nattie.

24:50.250 --> 24:52.440
How is the old battle-axe?

24:53.080 --> 24:55.450
- Your mom.
- She's fine.

24:55.550 --> 24:58.040
Oh. I'm glad to hear that.

24:59.190 --> 25:04.020
I'd hate to think that she came down
with amoebic dysentery or piles.

25:04.130 --> 25:06.360
What's amoebic dysentery?

25:07.160 --> 25:10.690
It's an infection in your tummy
where you get diarrhoea for ever.

25:10.800 --> 25:14.700
- Diarrhoea for ever?
- And your body dries up and you die.

25:14.800 --> 25:18.070
- You die?
- You don't have to be so graphic with her.

25:18.170 --> 25:23.640
- I read about it in a science book.
- Why would you want Mommy to die?

25:24.150 --> 25:27.120
Oh, honey, I don't want Mommy to die.

25:27.750 --> 25:30.150
Then why did you say that?

25:32.620 --> 25:36.460
Look, Dad, you're not trying very hard.

25:36.560 --> 25:40.720
We only get to come here once a week.
That's not very much.

25:40.830 --> 25:44.560
You're right. I'm sorry. I'll try harder.

25:45.700 --> 25:49.470
Nattie, I'll think good thoughts, OK?

25:49.770 --> 25:54.470
- About Mommy?
- I'll try. I really will.

25:54.580 --> 25:58.480
- And call her a princess.
- Oh, yes.

25:59.720 --> 26:03.280
And right now I feel like a toad.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.750
Daddy's a toad.

26:14.360 --> 26:16.920
- That's Mom.
- Can't be. She's an hour early.

26:17.330 --> 26:19.390
Come on, Nattie, we gotta go.

26:20.240 --> 26:22.330
No, no! Come on, sit down.

26:22.440 --> 26:24.170
Sit down!

26:24.270 --> 26:27.510
You don't have to run off
when she honks the horn.

26:27.610 --> 26:30.310
Come on, you're on my time now.

26:30.410 --> 26:33.410
You're my goddamn kids, too!

26:39.160 --> 26:41.420
Come on.

26:49.870 --> 26:51.530
Hi.

26:51.870 --> 26:54.800
Oh, Daniel... Charming.

26:54.900 --> 26:58.570
Thank you, Miranda.
I was going for a refugee motif.

26:58.680 --> 27:01.040
Fleeing-my-homeland kind of thing.

27:01.380 --> 27:03.210
But look at you!

27:03.310 --> 27:08.080
<i>This lovely Dances With Wolves motif.
What's your Indian name: Shops With A Fist?</i>

27:08.420 --> 27:11.820
- Are my children ready yet?
- No, our children are not ready yet...

27:11.920 --> 27:16.050
...because you are an hour early
and you were late dropping them off.

27:16.230 --> 27:22.060
Daniel, I don't have time for this. I have to
drop something off at the newspaper office.

27:22.230 --> 27:25.430
Newspaper? Are you taking out
one of those personal ads?

27:25.540 --> 27:30.230
"DWF seeks WWM with BMW,
into light B&D"?

27:30.470 --> 27:32.770
I'm placing an ad for a housekeeper.

27:34.010 --> 27:37.280
Housekeeper?
Why do you need a housekeeper?

27:37.410 --> 27:43.050
I need someone to be there when the children
get home from school, to clean, start dinner...

27:43.150 --> 27:46.520
- How much are you gonna pay?
- $300 a week. Is that all right?

27:49.560 --> 27:51.890
May I see the ad?

27:52.030 --> 27:56.860
- I have a right as their father. Please?
- All right. Anything else you wanna see?

27:56.970 --> 27:59.630
- Are you offering?
- Not any more.

27:59.740 --> 28:01.260
What's the change?

28:01.370 --> 28:04.340
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah, Mommy. We're fine.

28:05.980 --> 28:08.500
Miranda, why not let me
take care of the kids?

28:08.650 --> 28:13.480
I'll pick 'em up after school, be with them,
then drop them off at your house after work.

28:13.580 --> 28:15.140
- That'd be great!
- Please!

28:15.320 --> 28:17.950
- Look. The kids love it.
- Mommy, please!

28:18.090 --> 28:20.650
I'll think about it.

28:24.930 --> 28:27.830
We're his goddamn kids, too.

28:32.570 --> 28:34.430
Kids say the darndest things.

28:35.210 --> 28:41.040
Thank you. Any other choice phrases
you'd like to teach our five-year-old, Daniel?

28:42.510 --> 28:45.450
Come on, everybody get their coats.

28:45.550 --> 28:48.880
- Put them on and let's get out of here.
- OK, Mom.

28:48.990 --> 28:53.480
I would say go to the bathroom before we go,
but I don't think that's a good idea.

28:57.960 --> 29:00.930
Don't forget anything.
I don't wanna come back.

29:01.030 --> 29:03.060
Come on, let's go.

29:03.530 --> 29:06.590
- See you Saturday.
- Say goodbye to your father.

29:06.740 --> 29:08.760
Goodbye, Daddy.

29:10.540 --> 29:12.800
- Here's your ad.
- I'll get my purse.

29:12.940 --> 29:14.970
Yeah, you'd better.

29:29.830 --> 29:32.890
Hello. Are you calling
in response to the ad?

29:34.600 --> 29:39.000
<i>- Who was your previous employer?
- I was in a band. Severe Tyre Damage.</i>

29:39.140 --> 29:41.630
- In a band?
- I just wanna know one thing.

29:41.770 --> 29:46.830
Are your kids well-behaved, or do they need,
like, a few light slams every now and then?

29:48.340 --> 29:50.610
<i>- I'll have to get back to you.
- Wow!</i>

29:53.880 --> 29:58.790
<i>Ja, my name is llsa Himmelman. I want
to know how many children do you have?</i>

29:58.890 --> 30:02.420
<i>- I have two girls and a boy.
- Oh, a boy!</i>

30:02.560 --> 30:06.220
I don't work with the males
cos I used to be one.

30:08.970 --> 30:10.160
Yikes.

30:13.870 --> 30:15.360
Hello.

30:16.040 --> 30:20.740
Leyla, get back in your cell!
Don't make me get the hose!

30:20.840 --> 30:21.830
Hello?

30:26.820 --> 30:29.750
I am job.

30:30.720 --> 30:34.850
- Do you speak English?
- I am job.

30:35.190 --> 30:38.090
I'm sorry. The position has been filled.

30:38.230 --> 30:40.700
Oh, what a nightmare!

30:42.100 --> 30:45.230
Let's go in for the kill.

30:53.840 --> 30:56.040
Hello?

30:56.150 --> 30:59.240
I'm calling in regards
to the ad I read in the paper.

31:01.350 --> 31:05.250
Yes. Well, would you tell me
a little bit about yourself?

31:05.560 --> 31:07.610
Oh, certainly, dear.

31:07.720 --> 31:12.680
For the past 15 years I've worked for
the Smythe family of Elbourne, England.

31:12.830 --> 31:14.850
That's Smythe, not Smith, dear.

31:15.530 --> 31:22.270
<i>And for them, I did housecleaning, cooking,
and took care of their four glorious children.</i>

31:22.370 --> 31:27.610
<i>I grew quite attached to them after 15
years, but they grew up, as children tend to.</i>

31:27.710 --> 31:32.840
Oh, but listen to me. I am going on when you
should be telling me about your little ones.

31:32.950 --> 31:36.040
<i>- Well, I have two girls...
- Oh, two precious gems.</i>

31:36.150 --> 31:38.310
<i>No doubt the jewel of your eye.</i>

31:38.450 --> 31:42.720
- And one boy.
- Oh, the little prince. How wonderful.

31:43.260 --> 31:46.250
I must tell you,
a little light cooking is required.

31:46.360 --> 31:49.330
Oh, I don't mind that, dear.
I'd love some heavy cooking.

31:49.470 --> 31:53.930
But I do have one rule: They'll only eat
good, nutritious food with me.

31:54.070 --> 31:58.270
And if there's any dispute, it's either
good, wholesome food or empty tummies.

31:58.370 --> 32:01.280
That's my rule.
I hope it's not too harsh for you, dear.

32:01.940 --> 32:03.670
No!

32:03.780 --> 32:08.050
Would you mind coming on an interview?
Say, Monday night at 7:30?

32:08.150 --> 32:10.950
<i>- Oh, I'd love to, dear.
- Wonderful.</i>

32:11.520 --> 32:15.980
I'm at 2640 Steiner Street.

32:16.130 --> 32:18.320
Steiner. Oh, how lovely.

32:18.900 --> 32:22.490
- Could you tell me your name?
- My name?

32:23.130 --> 32:25.730
I thought I gave it to you, dear.

32:25.840 --> 32:27.270
No.

32:32.140 --> 32:34.770
- Doubtfire.
- I beg your pardon?

32:35.110 --> 32:38.270
Doubtfire, dear. Mrs Doubtfire.

32:38.380 --> 32:42.880
- Well, I look forward to meeting you.
- Oh, lovely, dear. Me, too.

32:42.990 --> 32:45.420
- Bye-bye.
- Ta-ta.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.150
Showtime.

32:56.270 --> 32:59.130
- Daniel, hi.
- Could you make me a woman?

33:00.470 --> 33:03.500
Honey, I'm so happy!

33:03.610 --> 33:06.200
- Oh, come here.
- I knew you'd understand.

33:08.580 --> 33:11.240
- Is this gonna hurt?
- Don't whine. Just relax.

33:11.380 --> 33:14.320
- Are you sure?
- Just remember, pain is beauty.

33:14.420 --> 33:18.180
OK, take a deep breath. Instant eye lift.

33:19.860 --> 33:21.980
And the strings are under the wig.

33:22.490 --> 33:27.730
- The man has five-o'clock shadow at 8.30am.
- All right, we'll start with make-up.

33:27.830 --> 33:31.360
- I'm not gonna wax.
- Don't worry. We'll just lightly spackle.

33:31.470 --> 33:34.960
- I feel like Gloria Swanson.
- You look like her mother.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.830
I'm ready for my close-up, Mr DeMille.

33:38.810 --> 33:42.140
OK, everyone. Let's pray.

33:45.210 --> 33:48.950
I hope you are using Jungle Red.
That is the color I love.

33:49.050 --> 33:51.080
- Matches your lips.
- God bless you.

33:51.220 --> 33:54.550
I'm feeling fabulous
because I met this beautiful Cuban.

33:54.660 --> 33:57.060
Every night is like the Bay of Pigs.

33:57.190 --> 34:00.090
I can't lie to you. It's beautiful with him.

34:00.230 --> 34:04.890
I don't know. This would scare the children.
Maybe this is too much for them.

34:05.430 --> 34:07.770
I think we have to go to the next level.

34:07.870 --> 34:09.670
Latex.

34:10.639 --> 34:13.270
<i>Oy, it was such a shandeh.</i>

34:13.409 --> 34:16.900
<i>I should never buy gribbenes from a mohel.
It's so chewy.</i>

34:17.050 --> 34:20.280
- No, I feel like Bubbee. This is not working.
- Don't worry.

34:20.420 --> 34:24.880
It's a work in progress and you're my brother.
I will never let you be embarrassed.

34:25.020 --> 34:27.510
- God bless you.
- We'll have to do the entire face.

34:27.659 --> 34:30.130
But look at this nice thing we have here.

34:50.650 --> 34:52.639
It's not working. I need to go older.

34:52.750 --> 34:56.449
Older? Like Shelley Winters older
or Shirley MacLaine older?

34:56.550 --> 35:00.040
- What's the difference?
- Some Scotch tape and red hair dye.

35:00.160 --> 35:03.850
- What about Joan Collins?
- I don't think I have the strength.

35:03.960 --> 35:06.020
But I have some plaster.

36:09.330 --> 36:11.320
Are we close?

36:11.430 --> 36:14.760
Any closer and you'd be Mom.

36:30.850 --> 36:32.910
That's disgusting!

36:34.650 --> 36:37.710
The most revolting thing I've ever seen.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.580
Awesome.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.850
What is this? Turn it off, will you?

36:44.030 --> 36:47.330
Come on. I want you
to meet this lady with me.

36:47.430 --> 36:50.990
I want you to be polite to her, then...
tell me what you think.

36:51.100 --> 36:55.430
Everybody stand over here
and help me decide what to do.

37:00.240 --> 37:02.770
Hello. Mrs Hillard, I presume.

37:02.880 --> 37:05.010
Yes. I'm Miranda Hillard.

37:05.110 --> 37:07.410
Euphegenia Doubtfire.

37:07.520 --> 37:09.850
Yes. Won't you please come in?

37:09.990 --> 37:12.390
Thank you, dear.

37:12.990 --> 37:15.890
- And these must be the cherubs.
- Yes.

37:16.990 --> 37:20.050
- This is Natalie.
- Oh, hello, Natalie.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.430
- Are you wearing bug spray?
- Nattie!

37:22.530 --> 37:27.160
It's quite all right, dear. No offense taken.
I was a little liberal with the atomizer.

37:27.270 --> 37:31.500
And at my age, it's like a good Stilton.
Everything has its own aroma.

37:31.640 --> 37:36.080
I admire that honesty, Nattie.
That's a noble quality. Never lose that.

37:36.210 --> 37:39.880
It often disappears with age
or entering politics.

37:40.020 --> 37:43.710
Look at that face.
You remind me of Stuart Little,

37:43.850 --> 37:47.290
one of the most honorable creatures
in all of literature.

37:47.420 --> 37:51.690
<i>- Do you know that book, Stuart Little?
- Yeah! It's one of my favorites.</i>

37:51.830 --> 37:55.730
Mine, too! Maybe I could read it to you -
if I get the position.

37:55.870 --> 37:59.270
- That would be wonderful.
- And who is this strapping young lad?

37:59.370 --> 38:01.630
- This is Chris.
- Hello, Christopher.

38:01.740 --> 38:03.530
Hello.

38:03.670 --> 38:07.440
Jeez, you're big for a lady.
You could play for the 49ers.

38:07.540 --> 38:11.450
Well, I was a fullback.
But that's European football, dear.

38:11.550 --> 38:14.020
- Soccer?
- Yes. You play soccer, too?

38:14.150 --> 38:16.350
- Yeah!
- Oh, isn't that amazing?

38:16.490 --> 38:21.010
Yes, I was captain of the women's team.
We won three university championships.

38:21.160 --> 38:23.220
Oh, but that was decades ago!

38:23.330 --> 38:27.760
But I was more disciplined then. I always
put my studies ahead of my athletics.

38:27.900 --> 38:31.560
I'm sure you're the same
and you've done all your homework already.

38:31.700 --> 38:35.330
- Well, not exactly.
- Really? Oh. That's a pity.

38:35.470 --> 38:40.930
Young men who don't do their studies
often miss out on more amusing activities.

38:42.010 --> 38:44.740
- And who is this young lady?
- This is Lydia.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.770
Hello, Lydia.

38:50.990 --> 38:54.440
This isn't fair, Mom.
Why do we need a housekeeper anyway?

38:54.560 --> 38:57.050
- This is all I need.
- Why can't Dad do it?

38:57.290 --> 39:02.960
Dear, I don't think it's appropriate to argue
with your mother in front of a stranger.

39:03.100 --> 39:06.500
I just don't see why
we can't spend the extra time with Dad.

39:06.600 --> 39:10.770
Maybe she's right, dear. Maybe their father
would be a more appropriate person.

39:10.910 --> 39:13.370
No, I don't think so.

39:13.510 --> 39:18.000
It's not my fault, honey. If he would
get a job and a decent apartment...

39:18.150 --> 39:21.410
- You see, he's the kind...
- Excuse me, dear.

39:21.550 --> 39:24.680
I'm sure you'd want the children
to step out of the room

39:24.790 --> 39:27.720
before you verbally bash their father. Hm?

39:27.820 --> 39:30.520
If I did that, I might never see them again.

39:32.800 --> 39:35.590
- I'm sorry. You're right.
- No harm done.

39:35.730 --> 39:40.360
- You're absolutely right.
- I'm not a therapist. I just see what I see.

39:40.470 --> 39:43.530
Why don't you guys go on upstairs?
I'll be up in a minute.

39:43.640 --> 39:46.770
- It's lovely to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

39:46.880 --> 39:48.940
You too, Lydie.

39:55.050 --> 39:57.180
- Oh, they're a spirited bunch.
- Yes.

39:57.350 --> 40:00.650
- Especially Lydie. She's got daggers for you.
- I know.

40:00.790 --> 40:04.560
- They're very upset with me right now.
- Probably the divorce.

40:04.660 --> 40:06.720
How did you know?

40:06.830 --> 40:10.060
You can sense it, dear -
the way she talks about her father.

40:10.200 --> 40:15.800
I don't think he's in the Navy, the way she's
saying she misses him. It's like he's nearby.

40:15.910 --> 40:17.870
- Yes.
- Oh, that's so sad.

40:18.010 --> 40:20.740
- Would you care to have a cup of tea?
- I'd love that.

40:20.840 --> 40:23.680
- It's right in here.
- What a lovely home you have.

40:23.810 --> 40:26.080
- Did you decorate this yourself?
- Yes, I did.

40:26.220 --> 40:30.740
Oh, it reeks of taste!
Isn't this lovely, dear!

40:30.850 --> 40:33.950
- Here's my résumé.
- Oh. Thank you.

40:34.060 --> 40:37.420
- Let me start this tea.
- Oh, no, dear. Let me get that for you.

40:37.530 --> 40:43.660
You've had a hard day. You just sit yourself
down on that stool and leave the tea to me.

40:43.800 --> 40:46.630
Thank you. That's very nice of you.

40:46.740 --> 40:48.790
Oh, not at all, dear.

40:48.900 --> 40:51.770
- Oh. What a wonderful résumé.
- Thank you, dear.

40:52.140 --> 40:54.610
"Expert in first aid and CPR."

40:54.710 --> 40:56.770
And Heimlich manoeuvre, dear.

40:56.880 --> 41:00.370
You can never be too prepared
when little ones are around.

41:00.480 --> 41:04.250
They'll swallow anything.
You've got to be ready to pop it out.

41:05.320 --> 41:07.410
Oh, let's see.

41:08.820 --> 41:11.380
What a perfectly appointed little cubby!

41:11.490 --> 41:15.620
Look at this. Everything
has its place and name tag.

41:15.730 --> 41:18.670
How precise! It's lovely.

41:18.770 --> 41:20.830
My husband never appreciated it.

41:20.940 --> 41:23.000
Oh. Poor dolt.

41:23.110 --> 41:26.070
That's not the reason
you divorced him, was it?

41:26.940 --> 41:28.140
No.

41:29.180 --> 41:33.050
It's so sad, because marriage
can be such a blessing.

41:33.150 --> 41:35.670
So can divorce.

41:36.750 --> 41:43.890
Daniel is a very difficult man to live with.
But the children are crazy about him.

41:43.990 --> 41:47.760
You don't have to be
a psychic to sense that.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.960
My, you certainly do know your way
around a kitchen!

41:53.940 --> 41:57.960
It's just because everything
is so accessible. You designed it.

41:58.570 --> 42:02.640
I'm amazed there isn't a little label there
that says "spoons".

42:05.150 --> 42:07.910
You remind me of someone.

42:08.880 --> 42:11.480
Really? Who?

42:13.560 --> 42:15.790
I feel like I've known you for years.

42:16.790 --> 42:20.190
Maybe we knew each other in another life.

42:22.030 --> 42:25.360
I would love for you
to come and work with us.

42:25.530 --> 42:28.090
- So would I.
- Great!

42:28.200 --> 42:30.260
It would be an honor.

42:31.040 --> 42:33.370
To us.

42:33.540 --> 42:37.100
To us. The start of a business relationship.

43:07.440 --> 43:09.540
Good evening, dear.

43:11.350 --> 43:13.370
Evening, ma'am.

43:19.220 --> 43:21.450
Cold night, isn't it?

43:21.620 --> 43:23.780
Yes, it is.

43:24.160 --> 43:28.260
Hope you have somethin' nice and warm
to go home to.

43:41.180 --> 43:43.240
My back.

43:43.380 --> 43:48.980
Jesus! If I find the misogynistic bastard
that invented heels, I'll kill him.

43:49.890 --> 43:51.940
God...!

44:00.530 --> 44:02.220
Excuse me.

44:02.330 --> 44:04.300
Mrs Sellner!

44:05.470 --> 44:07.800
Have we met?

44:07.900 --> 44:11.070
No. But Danny's told me all about you.

44:11.940 --> 44:14.570
I'm his sister.

44:15.440 --> 44:17.640
His... much older sister.

44:19.110 --> 44:22.410
- You have his eyes.
- Only if he fills out a donor card.

44:24.720 --> 44:29.450
- Is Mr Hillard in? I have an appointment.
- Do you? Oh, that's wonderful.

44:29.560 --> 44:32.080
Let me go up and get him
and he'll be right down.

44:32.230 --> 44:33.790
- I'll come with you.
- No.

44:33.900 --> 44:35.230
- Yes.
- Why?

44:35.330 --> 44:41.290
Because I have an appointment on Monday
and Friday evenings to check the apartment.

44:41.440 --> 44:44.270
I remember him saying something about that.

44:44.370 --> 44:47.870
Are you sure, dear?
It's three floors, hoofin' it all the way.

44:47.980 --> 44:50.410
- If you can do it, I can.
- I'll bet so!

44:50.510 --> 44:52.540
- Is your ticker all right?
- Topnotch.

44:52.680 --> 44:56.280
Oh, good! Cos I don't want to jump-start ya.

44:58.890 --> 45:00.290
Damn door.

45:00.390 --> 45:03.420
Come in, please, dear. Sorry about that.

45:03.530 --> 45:05.550
Here we are. Daniel's abode.

45:08.100 --> 45:11.730
Oh, that's mine, dear.
I'm a messy house guest.

45:11.870 --> 45:14.930
Well, just make yourself at home.
I'll be right back.

45:15.070 --> 45:17.100
He'll be back. I'll go get him.

45:17.210 --> 45:20.300
Don't be afraid. I'll be right there. Danny!

45:20.410 --> 45:24.140
Danny boy, where are you?
Oh, here he is, dear. I found him.

45:24.280 --> 45:26.910
Danny, there's a
Mrs Sellner here to see you!

45:27.020 --> 45:29.350
- Oh, is she here?
- Yes, she is.

45:29.820 --> 45:32.910
Mrs Sellner, I just got out of the shower!

45:33.020 --> 45:35.490
I think you'll be very pleased with me!

45:35.590 --> 45:38.990
I've been through
some really interesting changes!

45:39.130 --> 45:42.650
And I'm becoming a new man
and a model father!

45:43.830 --> 45:47.000
He'll be right there.
He's just changing, dear.

45:48.040 --> 45:51.560
I want to keep you abreast
of the changes in my career!

45:51.710 --> 45:56.270
There have been two big developments!
I'm finally starting to come into my own!

45:56.380 --> 46:00.710
Things are really starting to take shape,
and I'm blossoming! Really, I am!

46:00.850 --> 46:06.380
Things were hairy for a while,
but I'm in great shape now!

46:06.520 --> 46:08.990
I'm my own man now! Oh, yes!

46:10.260 --> 46:13.160
A job I could really sink my teeth into!

46:13.260 --> 46:15.390
I'll be right there, Mrs Sellner!

46:18.630 --> 46:22.540
So nice I don't have to
save face any more, Mrs Sellner!

46:25.810 --> 46:29.140
Mrs Sellner! How are you? Always a joy!

46:29.240 --> 46:32.510
If you wanted some cheese,
why didn't you just say so?

46:32.880 --> 46:36.370
Well, you'll be happy to know
that I now am holding down two jobs.

46:36.490 --> 46:40.420
One for an educational film
and TV company - heavy responsibility.

46:40.560 --> 46:44.930
- And the other?
- Cleaning houses. Not mine.

46:46.600 --> 46:48.860
- Big girl!
- Your sister is English?

46:49.000 --> 46:51.120
She's half-English, half-American.

46:51.230 --> 46:55.430
Half-sister, really. That makes her
an eighth English? I've never done the math.

46:55.570 --> 47:00.240
Let me see, my father was American.
He flew for the English during the war.

47:00.380 --> 47:04.000
He was in London and...
he met this lovely Englishwoman.

47:04.110 --> 47:07.740
Well, my sister was
the fruit of their passions.

47:07.850 --> 47:10.610
Sorry. My sister's, not yours.

47:10.720 --> 47:16.180
You see, she's not a very good housekeeper.
But she makes a fabulous cup of English tea.

47:16.290 --> 47:19.890
Really? Well, I would adore
a good cup of English tea.

47:20.030 --> 47:23.400
Oh! Wouldn't we all! I'll go get her.

47:23.500 --> 47:26.190
Sis! Oh, sis!

47:26.300 --> 47:28.360
Sis, are you in here?

47:28.470 --> 47:31.170
Tea? Cup of TNT.

47:48.890 --> 47:50.980
Sick. Mom!

47:55.660 --> 47:57.220
My face!

48:03.710 --> 48:05.730
I've gotta go down and get it.

48:08.880 --> 48:10.470
Norman Bates!

48:32.270 --> 48:34.460
Miss Hillard?

48:34.570 --> 48:37.660
- Yes, dear?
- I take sugar in my tea.

48:37.770 --> 48:39.830
Oh, your tea!

48:39.940 --> 48:42.500
I'll be right there with your tea!

48:45.880 --> 48:49.480
Coming right up, dear!
Sugar - one lump or two, dear?

48:49.580 --> 48:52.880
- Two, please!
- Tea, sugar, hot water.

48:52.990 --> 48:56.450
You got it. Coming right your way, dear!

48:56.560 --> 48:58.690
I'll be right there with your tea!

49:01.760 --> 49:03.530
No! Stop!

49:12.240 --> 49:13.710
Oh, shit!

49:20.320 --> 49:24.880
- Can I give you a hand?
- Oh, no, dear! I don't need a hand.

49:24.990 --> 49:27.580
I need a face.

49:28.560 --> 49:32.290
- Are you sure?
- Oh, definitely!

49:37.930 --> 49:41.730
I'm not a Muslim. I need a face! Oh, God.

49:44.870 --> 49:48.500
Miss Hillard? The water's boiling.

49:48.780 --> 49:50.040
Hello!

49:51.610 --> 49:56.640
Oh, I'm sorry to frighten you, dear.
I must look like a yeti in this get-up.

49:56.790 --> 50:00.650
This is my nightly meringue mask.
Part of my beauty regimen.

50:00.790 --> 50:05.850
It's basically egg whites, creme fraÃ®che,
powdered sugar, vanilla and a touch of alum.

50:05.990 --> 50:11.260
There you go, dear. Oh! You've got your
cream and sugar. It's a little cappu-tea-no.

50:11.500 --> 50:13.590
One drop or two? Would you like another?

50:13.700 --> 50:16.330
Oh! There you go!

50:16.440 --> 50:20.970
As you can see, I can't stay with you, dear.
I'm melting like a snow cone in Phoenix.

50:21.080 --> 50:26.210
There we go again! I'll go get Danny.
He'll be right with you. Hold on.

50:26.310 --> 50:29.550
- Danny!
- Coming, sis!

50:29.650 --> 50:33.210
- It was lovely to have met you!
- Lovely to meet you.

50:50.710 --> 50:56.080
- Had a little accident.
- Be careful this time. She's an old woman.

50:58.150 --> 51:00.770
Why wasn't I an only child?

51:36.720 --> 51:38.910
- Sorry.
- That's quite all right.

51:50.100 --> 51:52.120
Ready? OK.

51:52.800 --> 51:54.330
Did you have fun?

51:54.470 --> 51:57.340
- What did you do?
- I painted a picture of a bunny.

51:57.470 --> 51:59.700
The teacher liked it.

52:01.210 --> 52:05.040
<i>Here it is, Mel. $1,000 worth of hair.
What am I supposed to do with it?</i>

52:05.150 --> 52:07.980
<i>- Alan, I was wondering if...
- You want one of them?</i>

52:08.950 --> 52:12.080
<i>I'd rather make a coat for my wife.</i>

52:12.190 --> 52:15.750
All right, everyone.
It's time to expand your minds.

52:15.890 --> 52:21.160
<i>- It's homework time. OK?
- Yeah, but... after Dick Van Dyke.</i>

52:22.630 --> 52:25.260
No. Now.

52:25.830 --> 52:26.890
No.

52:28.240 --> 52:31.070
<i>We always watch Dick Van Dyke.</i>

52:33.540 --> 52:36.410
Really? Well, not any more.

52:37.850 --> 52:41.110
The only thing you'll be watching
is Deep Sea-N-N.

52:42.550 --> 52:43.950
Now,

52:44.520 --> 52:47.490
I know you're used to loosey-goosey.

52:47.590 --> 52:50.490
But I run a much tighter ship.

52:50.830 --> 52:55.230
Between the hours of 3pm and 7pm,
I'm in charge.

52:55.800 --> 52:59.730
And when I'm in charge,
you will follow a schedule.

52:59.830 --> 53:02.800
Those who do not follow the schedule
will be punished.

53:03.670 --> 53:06.730
- Punished?
- She's lying.

53:06.840 --> 53:08.900
She'd never punish us.

53:09.440 --> 53:11.910
Don't... fuss with me.

53:44.050 --> 53:46.450
This is exploitation. It's not fair.

53:46.580 --> 53:49.740
- Shut up, Lydie.
- Yeah. You got us into this.

53:49.850 --> 53:52.250
Ooh, my little ankle-biters.

53:52.390 --> 53:54.950
Do I sense dissension in the ranks?

53:55.060 --> 53:58.750
Are we ready for homework,
or shall we continue manual labor?

53:58.860 --> 54:03.700
- No. Anything but this.
- Then upstairs, my little nose-miners.

54:03.830 --> 54:06.890
Go. Flee before me!

54:07.040 --> 54:09.300
Onward and upward!

54:09.440 --> 54:11.630
Go pump some neurons.

54:11.740 --> 54:13.800
Expand your craniums.

54:13.910 --> 54:15.970
- I miss Dad.
- Me, too.

54:16.080 --> 54:18.600
Me most.

54:20.350 --> 54:22.410
I'm here, guys.

54:23.620 --> 54:25.640
In some form.

54:28.490 --> 54:30.580
Let's see.

54:33.960 --> 54:36.020
OK. Pinch of basil.

54:39.030 --> 54:41.060
Damn!

54:48.880 --> 54:50.900
Mayday!

54:51.580 --> 54:53.640
Oh, God! It's gonna blow!

54:55.980 --> 54:58.040
Easy.

54:58.150 --> 55:00.210
Damn. Calm down.

55:01.390 --> 55:03.450
Come on.

55:04.160 --> 55:07.420
How is it? Oh, my God.
It's clotted. Oh, God.

55:08.800 --> 55:11.730
This hollandaise smells like burnt rubber.

55:12.600 --> 55:14.730
God, it's hot in here.

55:33.960 --> 55:38.190
Look at this! My first day as a woman
and I'm getting hot flashes.

55:55.180 --> 55:57.540
- Hey, here's your food.
- How much is it?

55:57.710 --> 56:00.910
- 135.27.
- 135 dollars?! That's certainly...

56:01.020 --> 56:03.070
And 27 cents.

56:03.180 --> 56:06.020
Four dinners. 20 bucks extra for rushing us.

56:06.150 --> 56:10.090
Rushing? Well, you could have been
a little bit faster, dear.

56:10.190 --> 56:13.590
- There's 140. Do you have change?
- No.

56:13.760 --> 56:16.820
I thought you wouldn't.
Thank you very much.

56:47.230 --> 56:49.250
Hello!

56:50.800 --> 56:52.820
Hello! Anybody home?

56:55.400 --> 56:58.370
- Where were you guys?
- Upstairs, doing our homework.

56:58.470 --> 57:00.670
Mrs Doubtfire said we had to.

57:00.840 --> 57:03.400
Oh, she did, huh?

57:03.510 --> 57:06.480
Doing your homework. How great!

57:06.610 --> 57:08.380
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.

57:08.480 --> 57:12.420
Look at this place! It looks wonderful!
All spick-and-span.

57:26.130 --> 57:28.570
Dinner is served, madam.

57:29.470 --> 57:31.230
How lovely!

57:53.560 --> 57:55.460
Mrs Doubtfire?

57:55.560 --> 57:59.290
Lydia, dear. Get back inside
right now before you freeze.

57:59.430 --> 58:03.870
Look... I just want to apologize
for being such a pain today.

58:03.970 --> 58:07.670
- Oh, dear, it's all right.
- No, I'm really sorry.

58:08.980 --> 58:13.240
It's just... I'm still kind of messed-up.
About everything.

58:15.580 --> 58:17.640
We all are, sweetie.

58:18.450 --> 58:20.220
What?

58:20.720 --> 58:25.090
I just mean I understand
the pain you're all going through.

58:27.130 --> 58:29.150
Yeah.

58:30.060 --> 58:32.230
Well, I also wanted to thank you.

58:32.800 --> 58:35.930
- For what?
- For making my mom so happy.

58:38.540 --> 58:43.480
She hasn't been in this good a mood since...
I can't even remember.

58:45.780 --> 58:47.840
It's been a long time.

58:47.980 --> 58:50.380
- It has?
- Yeah.

58:51.690 --> 58:53.710
Well, I gotta go back in, but...

58:53.890 --> 58:57.350
- Go.
- OK. Thank you.

58:57.990 --> 59:00.460
You're welcome.

59:03.500 --> 59:05.520
Bye.

59:11.410 --> 59:13.470
Thank you.

59:26.450 --> 59:28.420
Oh, no.

59:29.520 --> 59:33.590
Well, milady!
It's a pleasure to see you again!

59:33.730 --> 59:35.750
A joy, as always.

59:54.280 --> 59:56.720
I like that Mediterranean look in women.

59:58.350 --> 01:00:00.380
Natural. Healthy.

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:04.050
Just the way God made ya.

01:00:05.190 --> 01:00:09.760
He broke the mould when he made me, dear.
He made me very special.

01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:12.670
He sure did.

01:00:13.900 --> 01:00:16.390
Bless you.

01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.220
I am not a crook.

01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:39.680
"She kissed Stuart and thanked him. "

01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.890
"'How was it down there? ' asked Mr Little,

01:01:42.990 --> 01:01:46.520
who was always curious to know
about places he'd never been to. "

01:01:46.660 --> 01:01:48.530
"'It was all right,' said Stuart. "

01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:39.940
Back off, asshole!

01:02:40.050 --> 01:02:41.740
Beat it!

01:02:44.350 --> 01:02:47.290
Broke my bag, the bastard.

01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:57.870
Lover boy's here.

01:02:58.010 --> 01:03:01.180
What a beautiful little car for Don Juan.

01:03:05.890 --> 01:03:07.950
So sad when that happens!

01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.890
It was our junior year in college, and your
mother got asked to design this big float.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:18.860
- I wasn't that young.
- I went to kiss her...

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.770
Elastic bands were flying out everywhere.
Hit you in the face.

01:03:22.870 --> 01:03:26.240
<i>- That's not true!
- It was like Jaws.</i>

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:30.280
- Isn't that the pretty picture!
- Oh. Mrs Doubtfire.

01:03:30.950 --> 01:03:35.080
Miranda. What a pleasant surprise
to see you home so early, dear.

01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:38.020
- And who is your gentleman caller?
- This is Stu.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:41.520
- He just wanted to come and meet the kids.
- Oh, did he?

01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:45.060
Ah, this must be the famous Mrs Doubtfire.

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:47.420
It's a pleasure to meet you.

01:03:48.460 --> 01:03:51.300
Yes, well...
Miranda's been raving about you.

01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:54.300
- Odd. She's never mentioned you.
- No?

01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:57.530
- No.
- Well... It's good to meet you.

01:03:57.670 --> 01:03:59.700
- You, too.
- Yes.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:04.900
I have a home in London. I was born there.
What part of England are you from?

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:09.540
- Here and there, dear. All over, really.
- Yes?

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:13.640
- Accent's a little kind of... muddled.
- Really? So is your tan.

01:04:16.260 --> 01:04:19.920
Dear, can you help me with something?
I found this outside.

01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:23.030
Yes. This is off my Mercedes.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:27.660
Off your Mercedes, dear?
You own that big, expensive car out there?

01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:31.100
Oh, dear. They say a man
who has to buy a big car like that

01:04:31.210 --> 01:04:33.540
is compensating for smaller genitals.

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:38.080
But not in your case, cos I see
that you're a strapping lad, aren't ya?

01:04:38.180 --> 01:04:40.880
- It was lovely to meet you.
- You too, dear.

01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:45.520
- Mrs Doubtfire, may I speak with you?
- Ooh, certainly, dear.

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:49.060
Could you stay
a few extra hours this evening?

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:53.320
Stu. That's more of a thick soup
than a name, really.

01:04:53.430 --> 01:04:55.490
It's a name. It's short for Stuart.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:58.690
- Is it?
- Yes. He's a client. And a friend.

01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:01.390
- He was a friend. He is a friend.
- What is he?

01:05:01.540 --> 01:05:04.270
- I don't know what's happening.
- What is it, dear?

01:05:04.370 --> 01:05:07.000
- Isn't he fabulous?
- Kind of, dear.

01:05:07.140 --> 01:05:09.770
If you like that handsome, rugged type.

01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:13.380
But personally I prefer
short, furry and funny.

01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:15.980
He just wants to go out and have a drink.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:19.990
- I think that's pretty harmless. Don't you?
- Absolutely not, dear.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:23.680
- They always have other intentions.
- This is business, mostly.

01:05:23.790 --> 01:05:27.090
I'll just sip club soda
and we'll go over wallpaper samples.

01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:30.690
Dear Miranda. Wake up
and smell the coffee, dear.

01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.390
Can't you see the lust in that man's eyes?

01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:36.400
It's too soon, dear. Really.

01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:38.770
You've got to give your divorce time.

01:05:38.870 --> 01:05:43.830
Let your sheets cool down before you bring
someone else into the bed. All right?

01:05:44.010 --> 01:05:46.500
Mrs Doubtfire, may I ask you a question?

01:05:46.620 --> 01:05:48.640
Certainly, dear.

01:05:48.780 --> 01:05:51.340
How long after Mr Doubtfire passed away...

01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:53.220
Winston.

01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:55.820
...did you feel any desire...

01:05:59.430 --> 01:06:01.190
Never.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.200
Never again.

01:06:03.300 --> 01:06:07.170
Once the father of your children
is out of the picture,

01:06:07.270 --> 01:06:10.830
the only solution is
total and lifelong celibacy.

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:12.830
- Celibacy?
- Yes.

01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:16.010
And if you violate that, heaven forgive ya.

01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.210
Good luck.

01:06:20.320 --> 01:06:22.370
Thank you.

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:30.260
"Preponderance. "

01:06:38.930 --> 01:06:42.030
Bravo. "Discriminate. "

01:06:49.710 --> 01:06:53.840
Oh, that's very good.
Will you excuse me, dear? Call of nature.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:57.650
Check those. I'll be right back.

01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:22.240
- Oh, God.
- Oh, God!

01:07:22.940 --> 01:07:25.440
- Oh, my God!
- Chris! Wait!

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:28.310
Lydia! We gotta call the cops!

01:07:28.450 --> 01:07:30.940
- We gotta dial 911 now!
- Why?

01:07:31.090 --> 01:07:34.610
Mrs Doubtfire. He's a she!

01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:36.660
What?!

01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:39.350
- He's half man, half woman!
- What?!

01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:43.920
- All right, everyone. Calm down.
- Freeze! Or you're gonna get it!

01:07:44.070 --> 01:07:45.500
- In the balls!
- Yeah!

01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:48.860
- She's got 'em?
- She's got everything.

01:07:48.970 --> 01:07:51.030
All right. Listen to me.

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:53.640
I'm not... who you think I am.

01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:56.910
- No shit!
- Watch your mouth, young man!

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.740
Oh, my God.

01:08:06.020 --> 01:08:08.850
- Dad?
- Yeah.

01:08:09.790 --> 01:08:12.390
- Dad?
- Yeah, honey.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.729
You don't really like
wearin' that stuff, do you?

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:19.960
Well, some of it's comfortable... No!

01:08:20.439 --> 01:08:24.500
It's a pain in the padded ass.
This is not a way of life. It's just a job.

01:08:25.140 --> 01:08:28.770
I don't go to old-lady bars or
anything like that after work.

01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:31.609
It's the only way
I could see you guys every day.

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:35.550
- Who did this?
- Uncle Frank and Aunt Jack.

01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.950
It's really you in there.

01:08:44.060 --> 01:08:46.120
Yeah.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.830
It's just a mask. And this is a body suit.
I didn't have any operations or anything.

01:08:53.970 --> 01:08:56.029
- It's good.
- Yeah.

01:08:56.170 --> 01:08:57.600
Hi.

01:08:59.670 --> 01:09:03.540
- Sorry I scared you. Come here, Chris.
- No. No, it's OK.

01:09:03.649 --> 01:09:07.310
I get it. I just...
don't wanna hug you or anything.

01:09:07.779 --> 01:09:11.180
- Not just yet.
- That's cool. It's a guy thing.

01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:13.609
Yeah.

01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:16.920
Well, now that you know,
you can't tell Mom, OK?

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:23.460
Cos if she finds out, I'll only be able
to see you through plate glass. OK?

01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:26.660
And we can't tell Nattie,
cos she'll blow my cover.

01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:29.960
So you have to promise me,
it's just us. All right?

01:09:30.069 --> 01:09:32.439
- You promise?
- Yeah.

01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:36.970
It's OK.

01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:41.580
All right? It's our little secret.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:49.649
Most of the dinosaurs were herbivorous.

01:09:49.790 --> 01:09:52.390
<i>But this Tyrannosaurus rex</i>

01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:55.430
is a carnivore.

01:10:02.340 --> 01:10:05.470
<i>The reptile-like Saurischia</i>

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:11.510
and the bird-like

01:10:11.650 --> 01:10:13.480
<i>Ornithischia.</i>

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:22.920
<i>Now, we're going to go</i>

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:25.530
<i>where no human being has ever been.</i>

01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.690
Oh, no.

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.390
Which one's the dinosaur?

01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:36.200
- The one in the middle, I think.
- Nah, you're wrong. They're all extinct.

01:10:38.070 --> 01:10:42.440
I can't believe they're still
subjecting kids to this. This is insane.

01:10:42.540 --> 01:10:47.640
There should be a disclaimer: Do not operate
heavy machinery while watching this show.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:49.810
It's incredible.

01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.910
This guy used to put me to sleep
when I was a kid. It's amazing.

01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:59.150
He has the warmth of a snow pea. Makes
Mr Rogers look like Mick Jagger. It's insane.

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:03.420
What kind of idiot
kept this guy on the air for 25 years?

01:11:04.070 --> 01:11:05.500
Me.

01:11:08.670 --> 01:11:10.500
You?

01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:12.470
Jonathan Lundy.

01:11:13.940 --> 01:11:16.640
Jonathan Lundy, General Manager, owner?

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:19.700
Daniel Hillard, former employee.

01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:23.110
Maybe.

01:11:23.690 --> 01:11:25.710
That's funny.

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:27.980
I don't mean to criticize. I just...

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:31.960
- Sometimes I have...
- Criticize all you want. Show's terrible.

01:11:32.090 --> 01:11:36.460
I'm gonna cancel it. It's pullin' down
the whole afternoon schedule. It's gone.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:38.590
You know what you gotta do?

01:11:38.730 --> 01:11:41.760
Start from scratch.
Give it... maybe a musical number.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:46.860
<i>- A little Tyrannosaurus rex comes out...
- Hillard, get your ass to the truck.</i>

01:11:46.980 --> 01:11:50.340
That shipment's gotta make
a six o'clock flight to LA.

01:11:50.450 --> 01:11:52.970
Tone, this is Mr Lundy.

01:11:53.450 --> 01:11:55.970
- He knows who I am.
- Yeah.

01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:00.420
Did you ever wish that you could
freeze-frame a single moment in your day,

01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:03.150
look at it and say "This is not my life"?

01:12:30.450 --> 01:12:33.220
Miranda. What are you home early for, dear?

01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:35.650
I had an appointment. Oh, thank you!

01:12:35.790 --> 01:12:39.020
With the court liaison. Mrs Sellner.

01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.630
- I can't believe it.
- What, dear?

01:12:42.230 --> 01:12:46.460
She says Daniel has some woman
living with him pretending to be his sister!

01:12:47.770 --> 01:12:53.640
- I told her he doesn't even have a sister.
- Mrs Sellner's probably mistaken.

01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:57.230
She's a social worker, dear. Really!

01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:00.970
And besides, how could he replace you?

01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.610
And so quickly. Really!

01:13:03.720 --> 01:13:07.150
She's supposed to be older
and very unattractive.

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:10.880
Really?

01:13:11.730 --> 01:13:13.790
Mrs Doubtfire.

01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:18.490
- Yes?
- Did you and Mr Doubtfire ever...

01:13:19.470 --> 01:13:25.300
- You must have had your share of problems.
- Oh, of course, dear. What marriage doesn't?

01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:29.100
But I always say: The bad times fade away,

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:32.270
and the good ones
adhere themselves to your memory.

01:13:32.410 --> 01:13:35.080
- Yes. Excuse me.
- That's all right.

01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:42.780
As I hold this cold meat,
I'm reminded of Winston. God rest his soul.

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.460
When did he... pass on?

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.330
Eight years ago, dear. This November.

01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:52.690
What happened?

01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:55.530
- He was quite fond of the drink.
- Ah.

01:13:56.440 --> 01:13:59.000
- It was the drink that killed him.
- How awful.

01:13:59.110 --> 01:14:03.270
- He was an alcoholic?
- No. He was hit by a Guinness truck.

01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:06.350
So it was quite literally
the drink that killed him.

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:09.010
- How tragic!
- Yes.

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:16.460
Oh, but he was a good man, though, really.

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:20.430
A sainted man.

01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:23.220
And despite his mountains of faults, dear,

01:14:23.330 --> 01:14:26.700
I always say: A flawed husband
is better than none at all.

01:14:27.900 --> 01:14:32.310
- Who needs a husband when I've got you?
- Surely you don't mean that, dear?

01:14:32.410 --> 01:14:34.840
- Well...
- Oh, that's so sweet!

01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.710
You can't imagine what it was like
being married to Daniel.

01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:43.580
Tell me, dear. What was so horrible
about this man you lived with for 14 years?

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.780
Well, at first, nothing.

01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:48.980
He was so... romantic.

01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:51.150
- So passionate.
- Really?

01:14:51.290 --> 01:14:54.160
He sounds like an absolute stud, dear.

01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:58.130
I hope you don't mind me
being a tad rude, but...

01:14:58.230 --> 01:15:02.190
How was he... you know...
on a scale of 1 to 10?

01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.670
Oh, well. That part was always...

01:15:06.410 --> 01:15:08.070
OK.

01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:10.410
Just OK?

01:15:11.010 --> 01:15:14.950
He was probably a Casanova
compared to poor old Winston.

01:15:15.050 --> 01:15:17.540
- What was the matter with Winston?
- Oh, dear.

01:15:17.650 --> 01:15:21.990
Winston's idea of foreplay was
"Effie, brace yourself. "

01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:28.320
It was Daniel's spontaneity and energy
I fell in love with.

01:15:28.430 --> 01:15:30.290
Really?

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:34.960
Everyone else I knew
was so organized, so scheduled.

01:15:35.070 --> 01:15:37.130
Like me, I guess.

01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:42.200
But Daniel was so wonderfully different.
And funny. He could always make me laugh.

01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:45.540
I always say:
The key to a solid marriage is laughter.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:50.580
But after a few years,
everything just stopped being funny.

01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:54.380
- Why?
- I was working all the time.

01:15:54.490 --> 01:15:58.650
And he was always between jobs.
I hardly ever got to see the kids.

01:15:58.790 --> 01:16:02.660
If I got home early to be with them,
something would go wrong.

01:16:02.800 --> 01:16:06.200
The house would be wrecked
and I'd have to clean it up.

01:16:07.570 --> 01:16:12.230
He never knew, but so many nights I just...
cried myself to sleep.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:15.940
Really?

01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:21.580
The truth is, I didn't like who I was
when I was with him.

01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:24.610
I would turn into this horrible person.

01:16:25.690 --> 01:16:29.450
I didn't want my kids growing up
with a mother like that.

01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:33.290
When I'm not with Daniel, I'm better.

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:39.020
And... I'm sure he's better
when he's not with me.

01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:42.760
Well, you never...

01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:47.200
I mean... Did you ever
say anything to him, dear?

01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:52.500
Daniel never liked
to talk about anything serious.

01:16:58.550 --> 01:17:02.680
I used to think Daniel could do anything.
Except be serious.

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:09.060
But then, I was serious enough
for everybody.

01:17:31.390 --> 01:17:35.820
- This is great!
- Isn't this posh!

01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:41.450
I'll bet it's very exclusive. Probably need
a credit reference just to get in the pool.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:44.220
- Amazing!
- Oh, Nattie.

01:17:44.330 --> 01:17:48.290
Not a single body
that exists in nature. Look at that.

01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.530
- Lydie...
- There's Stu!

01:17:50.670 --> 01:17:52.830
Where? Oh. On the board.

01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:56.130
Oh, isn't he a stunning piece of work?

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.370
Look, Nattie. That's called liposuction.

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:14.290
I hope he had protection,
hitting the water at that speed.

01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:17.260
- Let's go say hi.
- Let's do, please.

01:18:17.370 --> 01:18:19.960
- That's amazing.
- Stunning.

01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:30.340
- Hello! You look lovely!
- Hi.

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.880
Oh, guys, I'm so glad you could make it.

01:18:32.980 --> 01:18:36.940
- By the looks of you, that water's so cold!
- Yes, well...

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.990
Your tummy looks different from my daddy's.

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:45.420
Oh, Nattie! Not everyone has
their own personal trainer.

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:49.520
- Got your swimsuits? Wanna go for a dip?
- That'd be great!

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:53.700
- Good! How about you, Mrs Doubtfire?
- Oh, you wicked, wicked man!

01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.130
Isn't there enough flesh here
for you to feast your eyes on?

01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:01.700
- Come, Mrs Doubtfire. Don't be bashful.
- No, dear. They've outlawed whaling.

01:19:01.810 --> 01:19:05.180
- We'd be re-enacting the Titanic.
- Come on, Mrs Doubtfire.

01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:09.110
Oh, no. Just go. Leave me here.
I'll just sit in the sun and crisp.

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:11.950
You can't get heatstroke
twice in the same year.

01:19:12.050 --> 01:19:14.850
OK. Well, let's go, kids. Swim time.

01:19:15.220 --> 01:19:18.390
- Go, dear. I'll be fine.
- Your day's on me, Mrs Doubtfire.

01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:21.430
- Anything you need, put it on my tab.
- Thank you, dear.

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:24.860
Touch me again and
I'll drown you, you bastard.

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:28.660
I'll just sit here and watch you
move in on my family.

01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:37.880
Oh, God. What am I doing here?
This is beyond obsession.

01:20:05.840 --> 01:20:09.800
- Is everything all right, ma'am?
- Fan-bloody-tastic.

01:20:09.910 --> 01:20:11.470
- Can I have another?
- Sure.

01:20:11.610 --> 01:20:12.600
Great.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.660
Soda with a lime, please.

01:20:35.300 --> 01:20:37.740
- It's on me.
- No, thanks.

01:20:46.950 --> 01:20:49.010
Four iced teas, Todd.

01:20:50.050 --> 01:20:52.080
So, whose rugrats?

01:20:54.990 --> 01:20:56.680
Miranda Hillard's.

01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:59.920
- Miranda Hillard?
- The woman I'm seeing.

01:21:00.860 --> 01:21:03.760
No kidding? You?
The guy who's never having kids?

01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:08.230
Won't have anything to do with kids?
You won't even date a woman with kids.

01:21:08.370 --> 01:21:10.430
People change, Ron.

01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:14.340
I'm pushing 40. I don't want to
spend the rest of my life by myself.

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:16.840
She's got an awful lot
of baggage. Three kids.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:21.850
Three terrific kids, and I'm crazy about
them. Especially little Natalie. Look at her.

01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:24.110
She's a sweetie pie.

01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:29.480
God knows they need a stable father figure
in their life right now.

01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:34.890
- What about their real father?
- What can I say? The guy's a loser. I'll see ya.

01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:38.520
Loser? Oh, yeah?

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.660
Oh, sir!

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:50.070
I saw it! Some angry member
of the kitchen staff. Did you not tip them?

01:21:50.180 --> 01:21:54.010
Oh, the terrorists! They ran that way.
It was a run-by fruiting.

01:21:54.150 --> 01:21:56.620
I'll get them, sir. Don't worry.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.180
Good waste of juice.

01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:08.020
Loser.

01:22:10.230 --> 01:22:12.560
What are you lookin' at?

01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:46.220
Hi, boys and girls.

01:22:46.370 --> 01:22:49.630
Today we'll be talking about dinosaurs.

01:22:49.770 --> 01:22:52.970
It's A Dinosaurus Line!

01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:59.080
And please welcome... the king!

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:07.010
It's a dinner show. Hi! Where you from?
I'm gonna make you lunch.

01:23:07.120 --> 01:23:09.490
Thank you very much. Thank you! All right!

01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:12.680
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your claws together!

01:23:12.830 --> 01:23:17.090
Please welcome... James Browntosaurus!

01:23:19.130 --> 01:23:21.100
I eat wood

01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.870
It tastes good

01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.670
No meat, big feet

01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:29.570
I eat wood

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:33.510
Oh, I got to help myself!
Can't go on! I'm goin' extinct!

01:23:33.650 --> 01:23:39.180
Oh, thank you, James. But right now...
it's time for the Raptor Rap!

01:23:39.290 --> 01:23:42.120
I'm a raptor, doin' what I can

01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:45.380
Gonna eat everything
till the appearance of man

01:23:45.730 --> 01:23:48.890
Yo, yo, see me, I'm livin' below the soil

01:23:49.030 --> 01:23:52.020
I'll be back but I'm comin' as oil

01:23:55.300 --> 01:23:58.000
Very impressive, Mr Hillard!

01:23:58.110 --> 01:24:02.800
- I didn't know anybody was watching.
- I was watching. That's funny stuff.

01:24:02.910 --> 01:24:05.940
- Well, thanks.
- I think kids'd like it.

01:24:06.080 --> 01:24:10.310
- They'd be entertained and get information.
- That's kinda my theory.

01:24:10.450 --> 01:24:13.320
You don't have to play down to 'em,
just play to 'em.

01:24:13.450 --> 01:24:17.080
- Listen, I'd like to hear more of your ideas.
- My ideas?

01:24:17.190 --> 01:24:20.750
- How about a dinner meeting?
- Wow. OK.

01:24:20.890 --> 01:24:24.020
Next Friday. Bridges Restaurant.
Seven o'clock sharp.

01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:27.560
I'll be there.

01:24:32.910 --> 01:24:34.500
Take five.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:37.670
Take five million. You're dead.

01:24:41.150 --> 01:24:46.050
We've just had our first
home-cooked meal. I'm domestic now, huh?

01:24:46.150 --> 01:24:49.920
- This is terrific, Dad.
- You want more spaghetti?

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:52.790
- No, I'm stuffed.
- Garlic bread? I made it myself.

01:24:52.930 --> 01:24:56.160
Well, I didn't make it myself.
I cooked it. I sliced it.

01:24:56.300 --> 01:24:58.790
It's OK, Dad. Thanks.

01:24:58.930 --> 01:25:01.730
The place looks great. The food's terrific.

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:05.330
I'm really proud of you.

01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:06.930
Yeah. Me, too.

01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:09.530
Me, too.

01:25:12.510 --> 01:25:14.710
I'll be right back.

01:25:20.320 --> 01:25:22.810
- Thank you for knocking.
- Yeah.

01:25:25.060 --> 01:25:27.360
Look at this!

01:25:27.460 --> 01:25:29.900
I see you got someone to clean for you.

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:32.020
No.

01:25:33.870 --> 01:25:36.340
- Hi, guys.
- Hi, Mom.

01:25:36.740 --> 01:25:39.540
- Are they ready?
- No. They haven't had dessert yet.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:42.800
- You cooked?
- Yes. I cook, I bake, I sew.

01:25:43.210 --> 01:25:46.300
Thanks to this Amish
home study course I'm doing.

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:49.180
- I'm very impressed.
- Really?

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.120
Give me a second chance. OK?
Let me take the kids after school.

01:25:53.850 --> 01:25:57.590
- I can't get rid of Mrs Doubtfire. She's terrific.
- Why not?

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:00.250
She's the best thing
that ever happened to us.

01:26:00.390 --> 01:26:05.260
The kids are all doing better in school.
Chris is passing every single subject.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:10.130
I find myself getting home early just
to be with them. We're all doing so great.

01:26:12.510 --> 01:26:15.070
Sounds like an amazing woman.
Too good to be true.

01:26:15.210 --> 01:26:17.340
She is.

01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:27.640
- I kinda like the black one.
- Me, too.

01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:30.620
I don't know. Actually... Mrs Doubtfire!

01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:32.990
- Yes?
- We need another woman's opinion.

01:26:33.090 --> 01:26:35.150
Oh! Then I'm your woman.

01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:37.960
- Which one?
- What's the occasion?

01:26:38.070 --> 01:26:40.690
It's my birthday.

01:26:40.870 --> 01:26:43.500
Stu's taking me out to dinner.

01:26:45.470 --> 01:26:47.370
Neither.

01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:50.440
They're both too brazen, dear.
They cry "harlot".

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:53.270
Red is the traditional
color for streetwalkers.

01:26:53.410 --> 01:26:57.410
And the black one is far too short.
I hope you waxed.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.280
They both say to me "I'm easy. "

01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:03.620
You want to be Kilimanjaro
on your first date - inaccessible.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.590
Why buy the cow
when you can get the milk for free?

01:27:06.690 --> 01:27:10.130
No, let's find something more your own age.

01:27:10.260 --> 01:27:12.290
Something a little less tawdry.

01:27:13.130 --> 01:27:15.190
Let's see.

01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:18.860
How about this lovely frock?
Tasteful, elegant...

01:27:18.970 --> 01:27:20.940
Don't you think?

01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:24.600
And old. I wore that
to my aunt's funeral in 1976.

01:27:24.710 --> 01:27:28.080
A classic never dies, dear.
I think it's time to revive it.

01:27:28.180 --> 01:27:31.120
I think we should ask the kids.
What do you think?

01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:35.850
- I'd go with the short, black one.
- Yeah. It's the most fun.

01:27:36.690 --> 01:27:38.720
There. You see? I agree.

01:27:38.890 --> 01:27:42.290
Fine. You ask my opinion,
then don't take it.

01:27:42.400 --> 01:27:47.060
- I will not be held responsible for your virtue.
- You'll be there to protect me.

01:27:47.170 --> 01:27:52.470
- Stu has invited you and the kids to join us.
- Oh, how lovely! One big, happy family.

01:27:52.570 --> 01:27:56.300
I wouldn't miss that for the world!
Should be smashing good fun!

01:27:56.410 --> 01:27:59.970
- I'm so glad.
- When is this enchanted evening?

01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:02.910
Friday night, seven o'clock.

01:28:03.020 --> 01:28:06.880
- This Friday at seven?
- Yes. At my favorite restaurant. Bridges.

01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.080
- Bridges?
- Yes.

01:28:10.190 --> 01:28:12.280
- Friday at seven.
- Bridges.

01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:14.450
Sorry.

01:28:15.530 --> 01:28:17.550
- Bridges?
- Yes! Bridges.

01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:20.930
- The restaurant Bridges?
- Friday at seven.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:25.990
- I can't. Please, don't. It's bingo night, dear.
- Cancel it.

01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:29.580
I can't, dear. It's my turn
to pull the balls at the rectory.

01:28:29.710 --> 01:28:32.140
- Please join us.
- Don't ask me that, dear.

01:28:32.250 --> 01:28:34.310
I can't have my birthday without you.

01:28:34.410 --> 01:28:38.510
It's so important to us that you be there.
You're part of the family now.

01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:43.520
I can't have a birthday without you.
It would mean so much to me and the children.

01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:48.030
Please promise you'll come with us,
Mrs Doubtfire. You just have to.

01:28:49.800 --> 01:28:52.290
Who could resist that little face?

01:28:53.800 --> 01:28:56.290
- I promise.
- Thank you!

01:28:57.600 --> 01:28:59.500
Thank you, dear.

01:29:00.410 --> 01:29:02.240
- Are you all right?
- Fine.

01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:04.400
Let's see... Nothing.

01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:06.710
- Anything in May?
- Not a thing.

01:29:06.810 --> 01:29:08.840
It doesn't look good.

01:29:09.650 --> 01:29:13.180
I'm sorry. Mr Lundy is completely booked
for the next two months.

01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:17.450
- I'll meet him any time, anywhere.
- Sorry. There's nothing I can do.

01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:20.460
Please. I can't cancel.
It's a huge opportunity.

01:29:20.590 --> 01:29:23.720
Take my advice: Don't cancel.

01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:29.260
Thank you.

01:29:43.780 --> 01:29:46.810
- Come along, Nattie.
- Hello, darling!

01:29:47.290 --> 01:29:50.260
- Shouldn't you cover your shoulders?
- No! I'm fine.

01:29:50.460 --> 01:29:52.820
- Good evening, Mr Lundy.
- Good evening.

01:29:52.930 --> 01:29:56.760
Oh, God. Here we go.

01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:59.560
- Mrs Doubtfire, you look wonderful.
- Thank you.

01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:01.690
Come on. I hope you're all hungry.

01:30:06.710 --> 01:30:09.840
- Good evening, Mr Lundy.
- I'm meeting someone. Is he here?

01:30:10.740 --> 01:30:12.800
No, I'm sorry. He hasn't arrived yet.

01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:15.680
But we can seat you.
Smoking or nonsmoking?

01:30:15.820 --> 01:30:18.280
Nonsmoking, please.

01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:22.380
- Tanya will seat you. Table 15.
- This way, please.

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.580
- Reservation. Dunmeyer.
- Yes, sir.

01:30:27.290 --> 01:30:29.420
- Smoking or nonsmoking?
- Nonsmoking.

01:30:29.530 --> 01:30:32.400
- Smoking!
- Mrs Doubtfire, you don't smoke.

01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.900
No, I don't. But I did.

01:30:35.040 --> 01:30:40.030
I found the best way to keep from smoking
again is to be around those who do smoke.

01:30:40.170 --> 01:30:44.840
I have to randomly ingest just a little bit
of nicotine and it steels my wool.

01:30:44.950 --> 01:30:48.940
And I know you're Mr Health. Bless you
for putting yourself in harm's way.

01:30:49.080 --> 01:30:52.750
- Smoking.
- All right. Table 39.

01:30:52.890 --> 01:30:56.010
- Follow me, please.
- 39! My age! You're a saint.

01:30:56.790 --> 01:30:59.690
Thank you very much
for humoring an old lady.

01:31:09.800 --> 01:31:12.500
- He's pissed already.
- Mrs Doubtfire?

01:31:13.670 --> 01:31:17.970
- Would you like to join us?
- Oh. I thought I saw Clint Eastwood.

01:31:18.110 --> 01:31:21.740
That would make my day!
He is such a stud-muffin.

01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:24.910
Will you excuse me, dear?
I have to check my wrap.

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:28.680
- I can do it for you.
- Oh, no, please. I'm quite capable of...

01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:32.050
All right, dear. There you go.

01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:34.920
- Oh, and your bag too, ma'am.
- Drop it!

01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:38.000
Oh, I'm very sorry, dear. It's my medicine.

01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:41.530
- I have to go take my medicine now.
- We have water at the table.

01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:45.370
I can't take it orally, dear.
I'll be right back.

01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:49.870
- Would you like something to drink?
- Oh, yes. A good stiff Chardonnay.

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:52.100
I like 'em light and woody.

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:05.880
<i>- Hello. Bridges Restaurant. May I help you?
- Yes. My name is Daniel Hillard.</i>

01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:11.690
Mr Lundy is expecting me for dinner. Will you
tell him I'm running late, but I'm on my way?

01:32:11.800 --> 01:32:15.430
<i>- I'll deliver the message personally, sir.
- Thank you.</i>

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:26.040
Oh, Stu!

01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:28.010
I hope you like it.

01:32:28.150 --> 01:32:30.840
It's gorgeous! Thank you!

01:32:31.890 --> 01:32:33.750
Did I miss anything?

01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:38.720
Well, yes. Look. This is the gift
that Stu gave me for my birthday.

01:32:40.630 --> 01:32:42.650
- Isn't it gorgeous!
- Is it real?

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.820
It is very real, Mrs Doubtfire.

01:32:44.970 --> 01:32:50.060
You can either wear that or feed a small
country. That's so nice. So decadent.

01:32:50.200 --> 01:32:52.230
Mommy, I need to go.

01:32:53.910 --> 01:32:56.810
- Mrs Doubtfire, would you take her?
- No. You.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:00.640
- She wants you, dear.
- Well, I'll be right back.

01:33:00.780 --> 01:33:01.870
OK.

01:33:06.820 --> 01:33:08.850
Yes, well...

01:33:08.990 --> 01:33:12.550
Children, look at that lovely
dessert tray over there.

01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:17.100
Why don't you go over and pick what
you'd like now so they could reserve it?

01:33:17.230 --> 01:33:19.260
- We'll be back.
- All right.

01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.390
That's a pretty impressive
bauble you got her.

01:33:24.500 --> 01:33:26.560
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:33:26.670 --> 01:33:31.270
A fella gives a gift like that,
he wants more than a piece of her heart, eh?

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.880
Bit of a going-down payment, huh?

01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:37.640
- Excuse me?
- You know, dear. Sink the sub.

01:33:37.750 --> 01:33:40.050
Hide the weasel? Park the porpoise?

01:33:40.150 --> 01:33:42.210
Bit of the old humpty dumpty?

01:33:42.320 --> 01:33:47.190
- Little Jack Horny? The horizontal mambo?
- Mrs Doubtfire...

01:33:47.290 --> 01:33:50.590
The bone dance, eh?
Rumpleforeskin? Baloney bop?

01:33:50.700 --> 01:33:53.190
Bit of the old cunning linguistics? Hm?

01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:57.130
- Mrs Doubtfire, please.
- Am I being a little graphic? Sorry.

01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:01.700
- I hope you're up for a little competition.
- I beg your pardon?

01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:07.510
She's got a power tool in the bedroom, dear.
It's her personal jackhammer.

01:34:07.650 --> 01:34:11.050
She uses it and the lights dim.
It's like a prison movie.

01:34:11.150 --> 01:34:14.250
Amazed she hasn't chipped her teeth.

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:18.020
I hope you bring cocktail sauce.

01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:21.860
She's got crabs.
And I don't mean Dungeness.

01:34:22.700 --> 01:34:25.320
I'm being blunt as a spoon, aren't I?

01:34:25.930 --> 01:34:27.960
Forgive me.

01:34:33.410 --> 01:34:36.240
It's the wine. Oh, gosh!

01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:39.840
Be back in a flash.
All right? My tiny bladder.

01:34:43.720 --> 01:34:45.740
- Mrs Doubtfire!
- What?!

01:34:46.090 --> 01:34:49.920
- You're going into the men's room.
- No! Oh, so it is!

01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:53.790
I do need new glasses, dear. Sorry!

01:34:56.730 --> 01:34:58.760
Hello!

01:35:28.260 --> 01:35:30.130
Jesus! God!

01:35:42.410 --> 01:35:45.400
- Excuse me. May I have a menu?
- Of course.

01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:50.980
- What's France like?
- Very beautiful.

01:35:54.090 --> 01:35:56.150
Thank you very much.

01:35:57.560 --> 01:35:59.250
- Mr Lundy.
- Oh, hi.

01:35:59.390 --> 01:36:02.950
- Sorry I'm late. Did you get my message?
- Yes. Sit down.

01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:06.190
- How about a drink?
- Sure. I'll have what he's having.

01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:08.270
Double Chivas on the rocks.

01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:11.800
Bring him two doubles so he can catch up.

01:36:11.910 --> 01:36:17.070
- A Scotch drinker, huh? That's my kinda guy!
- Gentlemen, start your engines.

01:36:21.850 --> 01:36:26.840
- OK, everybody. Are we ready to order?
- Yes, I believe we are. Children, fire away.

01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:29.350
Shouldn't we wait for Mrs Doubtfire?

01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:32.450
Yes.

01:36:43.540 --> 01:36:45.870
- How are we doin' over here?
- No, no.

01:36:46.010 --> 01:36:48.030
Oh, yes.

01:36:52.710 --> 01:36:54.770
Now...

01:36:55.850 --> 01:36:58.650
What can you do
to help the ratings on the kid show?

01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:02.310
Bottom line: Don't patronize kids.
They're little people.

01:37:02.460 --> 01:37:07.590
You gotta personalize it. Make it fun.
If it's something you'd enjoy, they'd enjoy it.

01:37:07.730 --> 01:37:10.250
- That's what I'm interested in.
- Bingo!

01:37:10.360 --> 01:37:13.330
Well, I wonder what's happened
to Mrs Doubtfire.

01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:17.300
- We could cross over to the news.
- Would you excuse me for a moment?

01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:19.060
But...

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:53.070
- May I help you, ma'am?
- Yes, dear. Thank you very much.

01:37:55.540 --> 01:37:59.770
- Oh, my goodness!
- I'm so sorry! It's my fault.

01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:05.180
- Forgive me. Excuse me.
- I'm all right. There we go.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:07.580
Thank you. Oh, let's see here!

01:38:07.720 --> 01:38:09.780
- May I take your order, ma'am?
- Oh, yes.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:17.090
Let's see. I'll have the poached salmon.

01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.790
- And you, sir?
- I'll have the jambalaya.

01:38:19.930 --> 01:38:24.060
- Make mine not spicy. I'm allergic to pepper.
- Certainly, sir.

01:38:24.170 --> 01:38:26.200
Thank you. Cheers. Your health.

01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:39.150
Oh, my God.

01:38:39.250 --> 01:38:43.380
So sorry about that. Just one moment.

01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:45.550
<i>Carpe dentum - seize the teeth.</i>

01:38:45.660 --> 01:38:47.560
Let me assist you.

01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:51.430
A spoon. Oh, how clever. Wait. I've got it.

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:53.760
Wait. There. Make a pincer.

01:38:53.930 --> 01:38:56.930
Come at it from both sides. Together - up.

01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:00.560
Thank you. There it is.

01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.140
Just shake them off, like a dog.

01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:06.300
Sorry. Oh, forgive me.

01:39:06.410 --> 01:39:09.250
- That's all right.
- Sorry about my spray.

01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:14.650
I'll be right back. I just have to
re-attach them with a little adhesive.

01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:18.220
- Tell him to purée the salmon, if you will.
- Purée the salmon.

01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.790
Thank you. Sorry about that.

01:39:27.630 --> 01:39:29.470
Oh, that one.

01:39:34.370 --> 01:39:38.280
Oh. I didn't know there was
someone else in here. Sorry.

01:39:44.720 --> 01:39:47.410
Damn it! Oh, there it is.

01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:52.080
Excuse me.

01:40:13.510 --> 01:40:17.640
Where the hell have you been?
I ordered you another Scotch.

01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:19.650
Bully!

01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:26.980
Daniel?

01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:29.690
Are you wearing ladies' perfume?

01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:34.460
Yes, I am.

01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:39.590
Are you wearing lipstick?

01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:42.840
Yeah.

01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:46.070
Why?

01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:49.610
- It rubbed off.
- From whom?

01:40:51.650 --> 01:40:54.050
A girl I used to date. She's a waitress.

01:40:54.390 --> 01:40:56.450
- A waitress? Here?
- Oh, yeah.

01:40:57.290 --> 01:41:01.560
On the way to the bathroom...
Couldn't keep her hands off me.

01:41:03.860 --> 01:41:07.160
- You dog!
- You scallywag!

01:41:11.340 --> 01:41:15.070
I got the stretch outside.
Does your girlfriend have a girlfriend?

01:41:15.170 --> 01:41:17.840
- Hey, it's the '90s.
- No, no! I mean...

01:41:18.950 --> 01:41:21.640
Does she have a lady friend for me?

01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:23.940
- Go ahead. Ask her.
- I'll go ask her.

01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:27.380
Go on. Come on, go get 'em!

01:41:34.530 --> 01:41:36.360
Hey, Dan!

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:38.520
I need my order for table 39!

01:41:38.630 --> 01:41:41.900
- Relax. I'll be out in a minute.
- Thank you! Great.

01:41:47.970 --> 01:41:50.370
39.

01:42:01.850 --> 01:42:03.910
Table 39!

01:42:20.340 --> 01:42:21.970
Hot jambalaya!

01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:36.420
- Can I help you, ma'am?
- Sorry I'm late.

01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:40.650
But after all those Scotches
I had to piss like a racehorse.

01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.790
- Daniel?
- Yeah.

01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:49.830
Why in God's name
are you dressed like a woman?!

01:42:54.870 --> 01:42:56.930
Oh, damn.

01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:05.440
Well...

01:43:08.020 --> 01:43:11.050
I'd like you to meet
the host of your new show.

01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:13.420
Host?

01:43:13.530 --> 01:43:20.020
Euphegenia Doubtfire, dear. I specialize in
the education and entertainment of children.

01:43:22.540 --> 01:43:24.590
Surprise!

01:43:27.670 --> 01:43:29.570
Oh, thank you very much.

01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:32.610
- This looks terrific.
- Where's Mrs Doubtfire?

01:43:32.710 --> 01:43:34.910
Well, I hope the dear lady's all right.

01:43:35.050 --> 01:43:38.880
- Shall we start?
- Yes. Let's start. I don't want it to get cold.

01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:44.480
Tell me. Why would Mrs Doubtfire
be a good host?

01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:49.620
I'm a hip old granny who could
hip-hop, bebop, dance till ya drop,

01:43:49.730 --> 01:43:52.820
and yo, yo, make a wicked cup of cocoa.

01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:09.270
Stu?

01:44:11.080 --> 01:44:14.080
Oh, he's choking. He's choking!

01:44:14.190 --> 01:44:17.520
Help us! Somebody help!
He's choking! Help us!

01:44:17.660 --> 01:44:19.820
Oh, God! Oh, God!

01:44:19.930 --> 01:44:23.660
- He's choking here! Call 911!
- Oh, no. I killed the bastard.

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:27.760
- Mrs Doubtfire! Help us! He's choking!
- Help is on the way, dear!

01:44:27.900 --> 01:44:30.890
- Mrs Doubtfire!
- Help is on the way!

01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.030
- Mrs Doubtfire, he's choking!
- Hold on, dear.

01:44:37.540 --> 01:44:40.940
One more time, dear. Work with me!

01:44:41.080 --> 01:44:43.380
Come on!

01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:03.900
I'm all right.

01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:05.990
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:08.610
Almost lost ya.

01:45:13.780 --> 01:45:16.580
- Dad.
- Oh, my...

01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:21.010
Daddy?

01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:27.880
Yeah, honey. It's me.

01:45:30.230 --> 01:45:32.790
Happy birthday.

01:45:34.630 --> 01:45:36.000
Daniel...

01:45:36.140 --> 01:45:38.230
Daniel! Oh, my God!

01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:41.330
Oh, my God!

01:45:41.470 --> 01:45:43.530
The whole time...

01:45:43.640 --> 01:45:46.170
- The whole time?!
- I'm sorry, Miranda. Please?

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:50.010
Don't talk to me! Don't touch me!

01:45:50.150 --> 01:45:53.240
I have to go. We have to leave now.
I have to leave!

01:45:53.390 --> 01:45:56.180
We have to leave now!
I have to go! We're going.

01:45:59.230 --> 01:46:01.460
- You guys go.
- I'm sorry, Dad.

01:46:02.830 --> 01:46:04.850
Bye.

01:46:05.900 --> 01:46:07.960
Sorry about the pepper. I was...

01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.950
What are you lookin' at? Show's over.

01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:31.790
Miss Robeson,
do you have any closing remarks?

01:46:31.890 --> 01:46:33.950
Nothing further, Your Honor.

01:46:34.830 --> 01:46:39.200
Mr Hillard, since you've determined
to act as your own attorney,

01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:43.060
you are entitled to make
a closing statement at this time.

01:46:53.110 --> 01:46:58.070
Your Honor, in the past two months,
I've secured a residence, refurbished it

01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:02.120
and made it "an environment
fit for children". Those are your words.

01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:08.020
I'm also holding down a job as a shipping
clerk. So I believe I met your requirements.

01:47:08.130 --> 01:47:10.190
Ahead of schedule.

01:47:11.330 --> 01:47:13.730
In regards to my behavior,

01:47:13.870 --> 01:47:15.890
I can only plead insanity.

01:47:16.040 --> 01:47:18.630
Because, ever since my children were born,

01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:22.000
the moment I looked at them,
I was crazy about them.

01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:24.600
Once I held them, I was hooked.

01:47:26.050 --> 01:47:28.070
I'm addicted to my children, sir.

01:47:28.980 --> 01:47:31.040
I love them with all my heart.

01:47:31.150 --> 01:47:36.250
And the idea of someone telling me I can't
be with them, I can't see them every day...

01:47:36.360 --> 01:47:39.050
It's like someone saying I can't have air.

01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.690
I can't live without air,
and I can't live without them.

01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:48.830
Listen, I would do anything. I just want
to be with them. I know I need that, sir.

01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:51.690
We have a history.

01:47:52.670 --> 01:47:57.870
And I just... They mean everything to me.
And they need me as much as I need them.

01:48:00.150 --> 01:48:01.700
So, please.

01:48:01.810 --> 01:48:04.080
Don't take my kids away from me.

01:48:09.890 --> 01:48:11.910
Thank you.

01:48:21.370 --> 01:48:23.390
Mr Hillard...

01:48:23.540 --> 01:48:28.770
You've been able to fool a lot of people into
believing that you're a 60-year-old woman.

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:31.570
No easy task.

01:48:31.740 --> 01:48:37.910
And your little speech seemed to be
very heartfelt and genuine.

01:48:40.450 --> 01:48:46.880
But I believe it to be a terrific performance
by a very gifted actor. Nothing more.

01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:50.430
- No. It's not that.
- The reality, Mr Hillard,

01:48:51.060 --> 01:48:55.970
is that your lifestyle over the past month
has been very unorthodox.

01:48:56.470 --> 01:49:00.100
And I refuse to further subject
three innocent children

01:49:00.210 --> 01:49:04.440
to your peculiar
and potentially harmful behavior.

01:49:04.580 --> 01:49:08.240
It is this court's decision
to award full custody to Mrs Hillard.

01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:09.640
Oh, God, no.

01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:13.310
You will have supervised
visitation rights every Saturday.

01:49:13.420 --> 01:49:14.940
Supervised, sir?

01:49:15.050 --> 01:49:19.220
A court liaison will accompany you
when you spend time with the children.

01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:24.800
I am suggesting a period of psychological
testing and perhaps treatment for you.

01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:29.590
We will re-examine this case
one year from now.

01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:32.830
Thank you. Court is adjourned.

01:49:46.420 --> 01:49:49.620
I don't do laundry.
I don't do windows. I don't do carpets.

01:49:49.720 --> 01:49:53.660
I don't do bathtubs. I don't do toilets.
And I don't do diapers.

01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:56.690
My children have been potty-trained
for some time.

01:49:56.860 --> 01:49:59.490
Well, I don't do washing.
I don't do basements.

01:49:59.630 --> 01:50:02.900
I don't do dinners. I don't do reading.

01:50:06.310 --> 01:50:10.300
Yes. Well, we have your number.
Thank you so much for coming.

01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:13.000
- We'll be getting back to you.
- Thank you.

01:50:13.110 --> 01:50:15.170
I'll show you to the door.

01:50:18.020 --> 01:50:20.850
Yes, here we are. Please...

01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:29.690
Laura, that shipment
has been delayed three times.

01:50:29.860 --> 01:50:31.630
Yes, but...

01:50:31.730 --> 01:50:35.060
Laura, I'm not gonna wait
another six months for it.

01:50:35.170 --> 01:50:37.230
You do that. Call me back.

01:50:39.510 --> 01:50:42.600
Oh, guys, please don't be so depressed.

01:50:42.940 --> 01:50:45.070
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:50:45.180 --> 01:50:48.200
- I miss her spaghetti.
- I miss her jokes.

01:50:48.750 --> 01:50:50.610
I miss her stories.

01:50:51.280 --> 01:50:55.410
Don't worry. We will find someone.
There are plenty of people out there.

01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:57.460
Nobody like her.

01:50:59.290 --> 01:51:04.020
All right. I admit things were a lot nicer
when she was around.

01:51:04.130 --> 01:51:09.290
The house was so warm and cosy, the beds
were always made, and the dinner was...

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:14.240
She isn't real! We have to stop referring
to her as if she were a real person.

01:51:14.340 --> 01:51:17.240
<i>Hello, my dears!</i>

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:21.040
<i>We have a wonderful show today.</i>

01:51:21.150 --> 01:51:24.170
<i>We have Mr Van Zandt from the Sierra Club,</i>

01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:28.580
<i>and he's going to bring some animals
that are endangered species.</i>

01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:32.350
<i>- Do you know what that means, poppets?
- Did you say "puppet"?</i>

01:51:32.490 --> 01:51:36.190
<i>Oh, no, dear! It's Kovacs! Welcome, Kovacs!</i>

01:51:36.330 --> 01:51:39.590
<i>Hi, guys. Did you say "extinction"?
Does something stink?</i>

01:51:39.730 --> 01:51:45.500
<i>It's not something smelling bad. Extinction
means there's no more of a particular animal.</i>

01:51:45.600 --> 01:51:48.300
<i>- Oh, my God.
- Doesn't that make you a little mad?</i>

01:51:48.410 --> 01:51:50.400
<i>- Very mad!
- Tell people about it.</i>

01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:55.480
<i>I'm mad! You know why? Because next,
it's the chimps! There are fewer chimps...</i>

01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:59.140
<i>Doesn't it make you mad that
humans play your parts in movies?</i>

01:51:59.250 --> 01:52:05.280
<i>Ooh! "Planet of the Apes": Who gets the role?
Roddy McDowall! I'd be better than that!</i>

01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:09.560
<i>- I'd be better than Charlton Heston!
- And your rug is better, too.</i>

01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:12.630
<i>You could fly to Persia on that rug.</i>

01:52:25.880 --> 01:52:29.610
- Shall we tell them where we'll be tomorrow?
- Yeah. They wanna know.

01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:32.740
Tomorrow, poppets,
we're taking a wonderful trip.

01:52:32.850 --> 01:52:36.380
But you don't have to pack
because we're going in our mind.

01:52:36.490 --> 01:52:41.590
We're going across the Atlantic Ocean
to England, where I came from.

01:52:41.690 --> 01:52:44.530
- You came from England?
- It's a wonderful country.

01:52:44.630 --> 01:52:47.120
- Do you know about England?
- It's an island.

01:52:47.230 --> 01:52:49.600
It's an island, dear. A glorious one.

01:52:49.700 --> 01:52:54.230
- They have a queen and a royal family.
- Oh! Just like a poker game!

01:52:54.370 --> 01:52:57.470
- It's a full house.
- Some cards don't live at home any more.

01:52:57.610 --> 01:52:59.670
Thanks to mobile phones.

01:53:00.580 --> 01:53:03.140
Do you know what language
they speak in England?

01:53:03.250 --> 01:53:07.180
- Pakistani?
- That's right. In many stores they do.

01:53:07.290 --> 01:53:10.080
But we'll get into that tomorrow,
boys and girls.

01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:13.060
- You owe me a kiss, Kovacs.
- I'm gonna give you two.

01:53:13.190 --> 01:53:15.630
- All right, dear.
- Here's one on the cheek.

01:53:15.730 --> 01:53:20.560
- And here's a monkey bite!
- Oh, you wicked, wicked monkey!

01:53:21.230 --> 01:53:24.830
Well, that's all for today. Bye-bye.

01:53:24.940 --> 01:53:26.800
Cut!

01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:30.570
That's a wrap, folks! Thank you very much.

01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:39.040
We're a smash! Number one in our time slot!

01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:42.880
Yes! Calls from Detroit, Cleveland,
Chicago, Los Angeles...

01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:46.050
- All with offers to syndicate.
- Hollywood!

01:53:46.230 --> 01:53:48.320
Daniel?

01:53:48.460 --> 01:53:49.830
Yes?

01:53:49.930 --> 01:53:54.260
- Miranda.
- Could I talk to you?

01:53:56.070 --> 01:53:57.630
Yeah.

01:53:57.740 --> 01:54:00.300
I'll be right out. Just wait here.

01:54:22.530 --> 01:54:24.960
Welcome to Euphegenia's house.

01:54:25.100 --> 01:54:28.460
A little drafty but...
you know. It's nice.

01:54:31.300 --> 01:54:33.330
What can I do for you?

01:54:35.070 --> 01:54:37.700
First of all, congratulations on the show.

01:54:37.810 --> 01:54:40.780
Thanks. You got to see the dress rehearsal.

01:54:42.150 --> 01:54:44.640
We've... The kids...

01:54:45.620 --> 01:54:48.250
We've been watching every day.

01:54:49.420 --> 01:54:52.690
It's nice to know they can see me every day.

01:54:55.330 --> 01:54:59.990
Look, Daniel. I know it's gonna take
a long time to get over all the fights and

01:55:00.130 --> 01:55:03.730
all the horrible things
we said to each other.

01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:06.270
It's... It's so hard.

01:55:07.970 --> 01:55:12.380
But I know somehow you and I will be
all right and we'll get through this.

01:55:14.980 --> 01:55:17.380
But the kids...

01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:22.080
I don't wanna hurt our children.

01:55:24.820 --> 01:55:26.880
So what do you want me to do?

01:55:26.990 --> 01:55:31.730
You want me to pretend everything's
all right? Put on a happy face? Smile?

01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:36.130
Jesus, Miranda.
You took my children away from me.

01:55:36.240 --> 01:55:38.600
I can only see them now with supervision.

01:55:38.740 --> 01:55:42.610
Some woman watches me with the kids
like I'm some sort of deviant.

01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:46.400
If I try to hug 'em, she wonders why.
You know what that's like?

01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:51.810
You just sat there in that courtroom and
let that judge pass that despicable sentence.

01:55:51.950 --> 01:55:54.320
- I was angry.
- Oh, God.

01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:56.980
- You hurt me, too!
- You ripped my heart out!

01:55:57.090 --> 01:56:00.650
You lied... You know what?
I don't wanna do this any more.

01:56:00.790 --> 01:56:03.780
I don't wanna do any more
"who did what to whom".

01:56:07.030 --> 01:56:10.630
Ever since this happened,
I've been trying to make sense out of it.

01:56:10.770 --> 01:56:14.730
And the only thing I know in my heart
is that the children were happier

01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:17.600
when Mrs Doubtfire
was a part of their lives.

01:56:17.710 --> 01:56:19.200
Yeah?

01:56:20.250 --> 01:56:23.870
She... brought out the best in them.

01:56:24.850 --> 01:56:28.620
- She brought out the best in you.
- And you.

01:56:33.860 --> 01:56:36.260
They miss her terribly.

01:56:38.460 --> 01:56:42.300
- What are you saying?
- Daniel, the kids need you.

01:56:51.010 --> 01:56:53.030
I need them.

01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:03.190
<i>Well, tomorrow we'll have Frank,
who is a make-up artist.</i>

01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:06.690
<i>A big knock at the door.</i>

01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:10.020
<i>Who could that be?
And do we have enough time?</i>

01:57:10.930 --> 01:57:13.420
<i>Mr Sprinkles, boys and girls!</i>

01:57:13.530 --> 01:57:15.900
<i>Hello! What do you have for me today?</i>

01:57:16.030 --> 01:57:19.300
<i>Mrs Doubtflier,
I've got a letter from Katie...</i>

01:57:21.670 --> 01:57:23.700
It's the new baby-sitter.

01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:27.010
Come on, guys! Get up! Let's go!

01:57:29.350 --> 01:57:31.440
Come on.

01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:34.550
It's gonna be all right.

01:57:34.690 --> 01:57:37.310
Chris, wait right over there. Everybody.

01:57:48.800 --> 01:57:50.860
Daddy!

01:57:52.900 --> 01:57:54.630
Hi.

01:57:55.570 --> 01:57:59.340
- What's goin' on?
- I'm here to pick you up.

01:57:59.750 --> 01:58:03.580
Your dad's gonna take you
for a few hours every day after school.

01:58:04.220 --> 01:58:06.280
Really?

01:58:06.790 --> 01:58:09.250
What about the courts? That legal stuff.

01:58:09.820 --> 01:58:12.550
- Ask your mom.
- I took care of it.

01:58:13.230 --> 01:58:17.060
No more supervised visits.
No more court liaison.

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.130
- Just us?
- Just us.

01:58:31.610 --> 01:58:33.670
Go get Mr Bear.

01:58:34.050 --> 01:58:37.020
- Go get your stuff. Hurry up.
- All right.

01:58:41.590 --> 01:58:44.990
- Would you like to come in?
- I'll wait outside.

01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:46.560
OK.

01:58:49.830 --> 01:58:51.890
Thank you.

01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.400
See ya.

01:59:03.210 --> 01:59:08.580
<i>"Dear Mrs Doubtfire - Two months ago
my mom and dad decided to separate. "</i>

01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:10.810
<i>"Now they live in different houses. "</i>

01:59:11.250 --> 01:59:16.520
<i>"My brother Andrew says that we aren't
a real family any more. Is this true?"</i>

01:59:16.660 --> 01:59:18.710
<i>"Did I lose my family?"</i>

01:59:18.820 --> 01:59:23.060
<i>"Is there anything I could do
to get my parents back together?"</i>

01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:25.220
<i>"Sincerely, Katie McCormick. "</i>

01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:30.230
<i>Oh, my dear Katie.</i>

01:59:31.800 --> 01:59:37.170
<i>You know, some parents get along
much better when they don't live together.</i>

01:59:37.280 --> 01:59:41.040
<i>They don't fight all the time
and they can become better people.</i>

01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:44.170
<i>Much better mommies and daddies for you.</i>

01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:47.380
<i>And sometimes they get back together.</i>

01:59:48.420 --> 01:59:50.450
<i>And sometimes they don't, dear.</i>

01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:53.250
<i>And if they don't,</i>

01:59:53.390 --> 01:59:55.950
<i>don't blame yourself.</i>

01:59:56.060 --> 02:00:00.900
<i>Just because they don't love each other
doesn't mean that they don't love you.</i>

02:00:02.330 --> 02:00:05.830
<i>There are all sorts of
different families, Katie.</i>

02:00:05.940 --> 02:00:10.070
<i>Some families have one mommy,
some families have one daddy,</i>

02:00:10.210 --> 02:00:12.230
<i>or two families.</i>

02:00:12.340 --> 02:00:15.010
<i>Some children live with their uncle or aunt.</i>

02:00:15.110 --> 02:00:20.110
<i>Some live with their grandparents,
and some children live with foster parents.</i>

02:00:20.250 --> 02:00:23.240
<i>Some live in separate homes
and neighborhoods</i>

02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:25.410
<i>in different areas of the country.</i>

02:00:25.520 --> 02:00:31.430
<i>They may not see each other for days,
weeks, months or even years at a time.</i>

02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:35.020
<i>But if there's love, dear,</i>

02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:38.940
<i>those are the ties that bind.</i>

02:00:39.770 --> 02:00:43.230
<i>And you'll have a family
in your heart forever.</i>

02:00:45.480 --> 02:00:47.880
<i>All my love to you, poppet.</i>

02:00:47.980 --> 02:00:50.040
<i>You're going to be all right.</i>

02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:54.440
<i>Bye-bye.</i>
