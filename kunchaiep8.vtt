00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Who are you?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Tian. It's blood. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.000
What's wrong? 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:23.000
Someone attacked me. 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.000
I almost killed you, Tian. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Tian, dodge!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Hurry, go! Go, Tian. Quickly!

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.000
So this means you are really close to Tian?

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.000
He is like a benefactor for my siblings.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So I have choices for you.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
I thought we'd never meet again, Doctor Qi. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.000
Doctor Qi.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Do you know this mushroom?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This mushroom is called blood sucking mushroom.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.000
this mushroom grew from the remains of living things.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.000
Dong, a worker at my house has died.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.000
His body disappeared.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The whole family suspected that it was Li who did it. 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.000
So what do you think?

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.000
I suspect that it was Li too. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.000
Try digging the area where this mushroom grew

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and see if there is anything there. 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.000
Tell me immediately if you find something. I will meet you in Phra Nakhon.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.000
A human tooth.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Yang, since the mushrooms are all dead, 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000
what are you looking for. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I still have a doubt. 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.000
The mushrooms suddenly died. 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I want to check again in case we miss something. 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Yes. 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Yang. 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Someone dug the ground here. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Who did this?

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Yang. 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.000
What if Madam and Jia dug the soil here?

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.000
I don't know who did this

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.000
but if it was really the two of them, It's dangerous. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
We must be careful.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Please, hope it was just Aunt Kham digging for the mushrooms.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Bua, Yang. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Mr. Song would like to see you two. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
You two. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Why did you go to the mound at the back of the house?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Did you know something about those mushrooms?

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Do you know about the mushrooms?

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
So it's actually you guys

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000
who gave Doctor Qi the mushrooms.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
That's why…

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
you asked for Doctor Qi.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Why do you suspect the mushrooms?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Mr. Yang, please tell him. 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.000
So there will be someone to help us find the truth.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000
There's nothing.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
I just think that the mushroom is weird.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
So I asked about this, but it isn't that important. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Mr. Yang, why are you saying this?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Yang. 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Last time, you also lied to me

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
regarding Tian's Secret.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000
You said you secretly went out

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000
but you told me another thing. 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Do you think I will believe you this time?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Why would you suddenly take the mushrooms to ask Doctor Qi

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
if you don't doubt it?

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.000
You said I was lying and lying again. 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Am I wrong if I just wanted to know some nonsense?

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I already told you that it doesn't matter at all.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Yang. 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
The more you are like this, 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
the more I'm confident that this is a big deal.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
What's the secret that you can't tell me?

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Or does that mushroom have something to do with Li?

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Probably not.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Because if it's just about Li, you probably wouldn't hide it this much. 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Or is it related to…

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Is it related to Tian's secret?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Yang. 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Tell me. 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Even if you kill me, 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
I have nothing to say.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Is this really that serious?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Or does it affect the Song Family?

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
I think we're done talking. Excuse me. 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:20.000
Yang!

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.000
Where are you going?

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:23.000
Madam.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000
I brought herbal soup for Mr. Song.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
So what are you talking now?

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
I've never seen you requesting for Bua and Yang here. 

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Or is there something that I shouldn't know?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
It's about Yang. 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
He went out to have fun again.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
So I have to give him a lesson. 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Sir, please don't scold Mr. Yang.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Bua, let him do it. 

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
He'll suffocate if he doesn't curse me.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000
Yang, you're getting on my nerves. Go!

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.000
Go away!

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Please excuse me. 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Yang, are you alright?

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:40.000
Mr. Yang!

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Sir. 

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Yang is not a successor like Tian. 

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Don't force him. 

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Why didn't you tell Mr. Song the truth

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.000
of what we think or doubt?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Isn't it better to have Mr. Song help us find the truth?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
I had to tell Father like that

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
because if Madam and Li the really did it, 

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
the two of them did it to protect Tian.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
What if the two of them were exposed?

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000
The person who will be in trouble the most is Tian. 

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000
And his secret will be revealed to others.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Why? 

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.000
Is Tian's secret really that serious?

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Even Mr. Song can't know it at all?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000
For me, his secret is not serious or harmful to anyone.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000
But others, especially my father, should never know this.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000
You don't have to know his secret.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000
So you won't be discouraged because you can't find a way out for Tian like me.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Yang. 

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:07.000
But right now, Mr. Song suspects us a lot. 

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:11.000
He even secretly called the two of us to talk behind Madam Li.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.000
He probably doubted Madam as well.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.000
That's right. I'm afraid that if Father finds out the truth, 

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
it's going to be a big deal.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000
And will we let the guilty person go unpunished?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000
If we remain silent, we help the villain cover up

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
when the wicked should be punished.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
But if we do what is right, 

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000
an innocent person like Tian will suffer.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000
Oh, Yang.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I don't know how to help Tian. 

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000
What's up? Do you know Tian's secret?

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.000
Oh, not yet, Madam. 

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:15.000
I think Mr. Yang hang out with Bua everyday to the point that he forgets

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
which one is his real mother.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000
I don't understand my son at all. As a mother, I can't force him.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.000
Forget it, Madam. 

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.000
He hasn't told even Bua that he loves like a real mother.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:28.000
Bitch. 

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Can't you sleep?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000
I couldn't either.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.000
I'm worried about Tian.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So you really don't know

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:08.000
what secrets does Tian have?

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I really don't know, Sir.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000
I couldn’t figure out

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
what secret does he hide from me?

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Oh. 

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Or is it about Pin?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Because every time I talk about marriage, 

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
he looked unhappy. 

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
It might be possible.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:42.000
Because I've seen Tian look worried about not wanting to marry Lady Pin. 

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Then Mr. Tian's secret is probably related to marriage, Sir.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Oh. 

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Or is it true that Mr. Tian has...

00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.000
What is it?

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
He secretly has a wife and child hidden outside the house.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Because lately he likes to go out often, right?

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.000
If he has a wife and kid, why does he have to hide that?

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Maybe it's because that woman is inferior

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
or maybe she's a bad woman, 

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
not suitable for Mr. Tian, so it must conceal them. 

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
If it's just that, 

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000
I couldn't see why Yang and Tian have to cover up so much.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Or...

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Tian had an affair with a married wife?

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000
The woman already has a family.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000
This is possible, Sir. 

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000
If he steals someone's wife, he will have to hide it. 

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Such a disgrace would cause the Song Family to be attacked.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Bua. 

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000
Keep an eye on Tian and Yang well.

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.000
If something slips out, report me immediately. 

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Bao, you follow Tian. 

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000
If he goes outside, see what he does and who he meets.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000
This one.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Ratchaburi.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.000
This one is Ayutthaya.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
I hired someone to take pictures so we can give these to billionaires, 

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
or the merchants I know in case they might be interested.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
And here, this one.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
I think this one can be sold at a high price. 

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I myself have little knowledge of these things.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
If I sell them, the price will be lowballed for sure. 

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Thanks for taking care of this matter for me. 

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Yang.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Is my stuff causing you any inconvenience or discomfort?

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:20.000
No, why do you think that?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
You look different.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000
It's not like every time we meet.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Actually…

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I have something that stuck in my mind.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000
But I don't know how to handle it.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
Can I ask you something?

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
If one day I find out about something

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000
which is very serious, 

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
and if I say it out, 

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.000
the one I love will suffer.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000
But if I don't say and do nothing, 

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.000
and let this quiet, 

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
this will affect him in the future anyway.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000
What should I do?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:10.000
So what is it that you really want?

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Whatever that my loved one will not be in trouble.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000
You said it yourself that it will affect him in the future.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.000
So why not let him choose by himself?

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Whether he is ready to face it now

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000
or he wants to buy more time to wait for the consequence in the future.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Sometimes you have to let him decide on his own matter himself.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000
He may be able to make better decisions than anyone else.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Herbal soup. 

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Thanks. 

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
What's wrong?

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.000
I'm going to check the work at the warehouse.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.000
You can let Tian oversee it. 

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.000
You are still not feeling well.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:33.000
It's okay, I'd better go out and see it myself. 

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Bao.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Bring me the walking stick.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000
A tooth?

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000
This is a human tooth.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Yes, Doctor Qi. 

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000
I dug the soil where the mushroom grew.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000
I only found one tooth no matter how hard I dug it. 

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Maybe it was related to Dong's body that had disappeared earlier.

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
But I only found a tooth.

00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:51.000
Where did the other pieces go, Doctor?

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Something…

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000
can destroy the remains of living beings without a trace.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Sir. 

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Besides Madam Li and Jia, 

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000
do you think there is anyone else suspicious?

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000
For me, everyone seems suspicious right now. 

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Everything seems to be related to Tian's secret.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:27.000
But I don't know what his secret is. 

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Yang.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Did you meet Lady Pin today? You've been gone all day.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.000
What's wrong?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Tian. 

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000
You know, right? No matter what happens, 

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000
I will always be by your side.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.000
This is a mushroom that grows behind our house.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Tian. 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Listen to me carefully. 

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000
This matter is very important and it is directly related to you. 

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:19.000
At first, I thought I'd be secretly investigating this without affecting you. 

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:24.000
But the more I searched for the truth, the more it makes you difficult.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
This mushroom...

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
It's called a blood sucking mushroom.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000
It was produced by mixing a kind of orchid with special ingredients.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
And it can grow in the remains of living things.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Remains of living things?

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Tian. 

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
I think that…

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
It probably grew from Dong's corpse.

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.000
Dong's corpse?

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000
So that day...

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Do you remember?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000
When we went to open the coffin, the body was an old man's.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.000
And before that,

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Madam Li let Auntie Jia sleep there and watch Dong's body.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
And I think she used that chance

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
to switch Dong's body and buried it at the back of our house.

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:28.000
It might not be what you think. 

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:29.000
Tian. 

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000
So didn't you wonder

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000
why everyone in the house ate the mushrooms, but no one fell ill?

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Only Madam Li

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000
who ate a mushroom vomited and had a fever.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Because she knew where that mushroom came from.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Aunt Jia is also good at preparing herbs and medicine. 

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
And who else would have thought of doing something like this?

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Tian. 

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.000
I'm sorry to have to say this.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000
But I think this will affect you in the future.

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000
I want you to prepare and find a way to deal with it beforehand. 

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
If it is true, 

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
how am I going to handle it?

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Mother is the villain who killed a man. 

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
And I can't tell anyone.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Yang.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
I really don't know what to do.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Tian. 

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000
All of this happened because of me. 

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Because of me. 

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Mother did this…

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:11.000
because she wanted to hide my secret.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Yang.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Do you know how miserable I am?

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
I have to live in misery.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000
Suffering because of this damn secret.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Because of the secret.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
The secret…

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000
The secret…

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
The secret that I am...

00:24:58.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Don't say it.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.000
You don't have to say anything now. 

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Yang.

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Don't say it.

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Stay still, don't speak.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.000
Yang, this bastard. 

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
By the way, those mushrooms…

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Are you sure that the mushrooms we ate came from Dong's corpse?

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
I shouldn't eat too much.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
That's what I heard. 

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Should we tell Mr. Song about this?

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:11.800
No. 

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000
I think every time we fail, it's because we always rant and make it a big deal. 

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
If what I heard about the mushrooms is true, 

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:24.000
we will have to find evidence to catch the villain red-handed.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.000
If Jia was the one who actually made the mushroom grow from the corpse,

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000
we'll have to figure out how she did it. 

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:40.000
And we had to catch her for working with Madam Li to kill Dong

00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.000
to conceal a secret for Tian. 

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:47.000
They deserves the death penalty for killing someone cruelly like this.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.000
Correct.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
And if two of them die, 

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:59.000
My son, Yang will inherit the position from Mr. Song without anyone interfering.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Who's in my room?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Who are you?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Madam. 

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Tian. 

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000
What are you doing?

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:33.000
You ask me what I am doing?

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
I'm here to find out what you and Aunt Jia are hiding from me. 

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000
What you use to kill a man, Mother.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Mother. 

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Aunt Jia, Aunt Jia. 

00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:52.000
Aunt Jia, give it to me. Aunt Jia. Give it to me now.

00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:53.000
Tian, Tian, what are you doing?

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Mother. 

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000
I know it already that the mushrooms in our backyards grew from Dong's corpse.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Nonsense. 

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Where did you hear this?

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Don't listen to what other people say.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
They slandered me and Madam.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Neither of us killed Dong. 

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.000
If you didn't kill him, 

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
why did you have to swap his body with someone else?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Why? 

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Before the funeral, 

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000
you received an order from Mother to watch over Dong's body. 

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Is there a reason or a necessity

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000
for a butler of Song Family's First Madam to take care of a body of an ordinary people like that?

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Why? 

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.000
If you think that I and Jia really did it, 

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
go inform the authorities and your father to arrest me. 

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Mother. 

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Just go!

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Tian! Tian!

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Where are you going?

00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:42.000
Tian, stop now. 

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.000
Mr. Tian, what are you going to do?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
What are you doing? Stop!

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Tian, stop!

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:52.000
What are you doing?

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.000
I will tell everyone the truth.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.000
I don't want to keep it a secret anymore, Mother.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000
You can't. 

00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:03.000
Do you know that if you tell everyone, you will lose everything?

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.400
I know it. 

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000
I do. 

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
I'm willing to lose everything.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.000
But I don't want you or anyone

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:16.000
to be in trouble because you have to hide my secret anymore.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Tian! Tian!

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.000
What are you doing?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000
Mr. Tian, Mr. Yang.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Mr. Tian, Mr. Yang.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:35.000
What's the matter?

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Why are you summoning us at this time?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Yeah, what's wrong?

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.000
What's going on here?

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
What happened?

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000
Hitting the gong at this time, or is there a thief?

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Or a fire?

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.000
A thief?

00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:03.000
Did you check carefully? Have you looked at the garage yet?

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:04.000
Did you forget to close the window?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Tian. 

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
If you say it, 

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
get ready to attend my funeral.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Hey everyone, can you be quiet?

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000
So what is it, Tian?

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000
What's going on?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Tian. 

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Or someone died?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Well…

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Tian and I saw a snake.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
We were shocked, so we called everyone to help us catch it. 

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Is it true?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Yes, Father. 

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000
What are you going to do about Tian?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Let him go for now. 

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Now he's sad.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
I will find a chance to talk to him later.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Who gave Mr. Tian the mushrooms?

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Whoever the person is, we have to find out. 

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:45.000
What we have to do now,

00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:49.000
in addition to making Tian take the position as quickly as possible, 

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000
we have to find out who knows about this mushroom.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000
You suspect Mr. Tian hitting the gong last night?

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Yes. 

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000
I don't believe

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000
that he called everyone to catch the snake as Li said.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
It must be a secret about Tian.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Because both mother and son acted strange.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:34:23.700 --> 00:34:24.000
Sir. 

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.000
Bao, how was it?

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.000
I have investigated. 

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Mr. Tian likes to hang around Mr. Ma's neighborhood.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
And the locals are friendly with him. 

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
The girls are interested in him quite a lot. 

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000
But Mr. Tian is not particularly interested in any of them.

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.000
Then Tian's secret

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
is probably not about women.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
What exactly is it?

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Where are you going?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Where are you going, pretty?

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Want us to walk you home?

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.000
It's okay, I'm almost there. 

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000
You're sweet, your skin is also fair.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Your breast is…

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Crazy bastard.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:45.000
Scold at me, scold again. It's very exciting. I like it.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Follow her quickly.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Excuse me, please help me, these bastards are going to kidnap me.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Acting like a hooker. 

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000
If you don't want a husband, then why are you dressed to seduce men?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000
It's my business, bastard. 

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
No matter how she dresses, it's up to her. What that's got to do with it?

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
It's her body, she can dress up anything.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
You guys have no right to harass or hurt her. 

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
So is it your business too? Don't get in my way.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Let's go. 

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Hurry.

00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.000
Quickly. 

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Thank you very much. 

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Are you hurt?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Can I have a look?

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
So what are you doing here?

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:54.000
Sir. 

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Someone wants to apply for a job.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Jiu. 

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Do you know each other?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
I'm really worried about you.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Since someone tried to shoot me that day, I don't know how you've been.

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.000
Where have you been?

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
I went to see you at home but your house closed all the time.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
I moved out.

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Why did you move out?

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Because of the culprit? Who are they?

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
It doesn't matter.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Those who shot you were just thieves.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
They might think that you seemed to have money, so I wanted to rob you. 

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:05.000
Actually, I moved out because

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000
I don't have money to pay rent.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000
I think of what you said. If I was in trouble, I should come to you.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000
What about Mei and Fu?

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Where are they now?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Why don't you bring them along?

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
I sent them to live with my relative right now. 

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
You don't have to worry about your job and accommodation.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
So...

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
What do you want to do?

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Do you do an account?

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Or the paperwork?

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
No. 

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
You don't want to do accounting or paperwork.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000
So what would you like to work on?

00:39:53.500 --> 00:39:54.000
I'm illiterate.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000
I can't read and write.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
I can't do the job you said.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
I can only do the labor job.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.000
You can't write or read, 

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
but you learn. 

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
I'll be the one to teach you.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
We didn't know how to do things since we were born.

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Even if you start a little late, 

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000
but I believe you can do it anyway. 

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000
In the meantime, 

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
you just do a small job as I assign you. 

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.000
I will teach you my yourself.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
If you don't want to kill Tian, 

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:02.000
you have to find out what his secret is. 

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.000
If you are successful, 

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
it is considered that you save his life.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Does Mr. Tian let you stay here?

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
This room doesn't seem that far from my room.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000
If you're lonely, you can go talk to me in my room.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Mud, what's wrong?

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000
I don't know what bites my leg.

00:41:55.200 --> 00:41:56.000
Let me see it.

00:41:56.500 --> 00:41:59.000
Ouch, it hurts so much, right here.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Can you see it?

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Jiu. 

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
How are you? Are you alright?

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Tian. 

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Jiu. 

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
What's wrong with the men in this house?

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Tian, Tian.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
You misunderstood now. 

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.000
What did I misunderstand?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
About me and Mud. 

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000
What you do is up to you.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Whether you like or fond of each other, 

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:03.000
it's none of my business anyway. 

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Are you angry with me?

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:07.000
Why would I be angry?

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Or do you...

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
You like...

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
You like Mud?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.000
Do you like her?

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000
No. 

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
You don't have to hide from me.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
I really don't like Mud. 

00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:41.000
I never thought of her like that.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:44.000
I only see her as a member in the house.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
I don't like Mud either. 

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
It's impossible for me and her. 

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:57.000
Well, if you're not angry about me and Mud. 

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Why are you angry with me?

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Forget it.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Scales of beetle orchid.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:34.000
This tooth really came from the corpse of someone who was poisoned by the beetle orchid.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Flowers, Madam. 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Aunt Jia said that you wanted flowers to pay homage to the Buddha. 

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Thanks. 

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000
I want to pay homage to the Buddha because I'm worried. 

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000
I don't know what to do.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
What are you worried about, Madam?

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Someone wants me and Tian to split up.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Telling my son about something crazy.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Do you know who slandered me?

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
No. 

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Bua. 

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Do you know that I love and trust you?

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:42.000
To the point that I let you be another mother of Tian.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:48.000
In the past, the two of us have supported each other.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
We have helped each other all along. 

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
You won't leave me, right?

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
No, Madam. 

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000
If there's nothing, please excuse me. 

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
You can go now. 

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Keep an eye on Bua. 

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
It seems like Madam Li started to suspect us. 

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:07.000
This morning, she said that someone had told Tian a slander on her. 

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
I'm the one who did it. 

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.000
Oh. 

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000
I was the one who told Tian that I was suspicious of Madam and Aunt Jia.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000
I told him about the blood sucking mushrooms and everything.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000
From now on, Tian should be the one who decide for himself on what he wants.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Then Madam Li said this to test me. 

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.000
We must be more careful, Yang.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.000
This one read 'Ngor Ngoo'.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Ngor Ngoo. / Ngoo (snake).

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Ngoo.

00:48:01.300 --> 00:48:02.000
Ngoo.

00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.000
It's snake.

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Ngor Ngoo. 

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
This one reads Jor Jan. 

00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Your name is also written with this one.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Jor Jan. 

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
So how do I write my name?

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.000
I'll write it for you.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Your name is written like this.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
I can write my name now.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000
You're so quick-witted 

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
I taught you a little and you can do it fluently.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
I want my siblings to learn something like this.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:44.000
So they will have knowledge and not stupid like me.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
So their lives will have more options than me.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000
It's alright. 

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
When Mei and Fu are feeling better, 

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
you can pick them up from your relative's house.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
I will find a way to enroll them in a school.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:11.000
Letting them live here with you.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Thanks so much. 

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000
You are really good to me.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Well, how do you write your name?

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:32.000
Tian. 

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Father.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Who is this?

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000
This is Jiu, the new worker I've hired.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Sir. 

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Your facial feature is good. 

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Even if you have a hard time, 

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
there is always someone who helps you.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000
Father, Jiu saved my life

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:44.000
when I was attacked by Japanese soldiers.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Really?

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
You're a benefactor to Tian. 

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Thank you very much

00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.000
for saving him. 

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Good.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000
You have someone you can trust close to you.

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000
So you can help each other.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:14.000
Yes, Father. 

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:29.000
Move. 

00:53:29.300 --> 00:54:30.000
What's wrong?

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Jiu, eat more so that you will have energy to work.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Oh, seeing a new male worker, you hurry to take care of him huh?

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:50.000
You don't take care of Mr. Tian, giving him food anymore?

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Mr. Tian is our boss. I have to do my job. 

00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Are you really that close to Mr. Tian?

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Mud approaches all men.

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000
She's not close to anyone, she just wants men. 

00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:07.000
Bitch. 

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:08.000
Be careful.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.000
Really.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
And who is Mr. Tian close to?

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000
As far as I can see, he is very close to Mr. Yang, his brother.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000
Other than that, I don't see him messing with anyone. He always works. 

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.000
You're lucky to work here.

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:30.000
Mr. Tian is kind, compassionate and humble.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
He never oppressed the workers.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.000
Everyone loves him. Do you think so?

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Yes. I'm really envious of Lady Pin. 

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Lady Pin? Who is it?

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
She's Mr. Tian's fiancée.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Mr. Tian has a fiancée?

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:47.000
Yeah. 

00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.000
It's okay.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Here. Let your sister take the medicine.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.000
It's annoying that she cries. 

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Mei, take the medicine.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Aren't you feeling better now?

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
It's alright. 

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.000
I'm hurt. 

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Mei, you'll be alright. 

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Hey, drink more. 

00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000
You'll be fine. 

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.000
You'll be better. 

00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:05.000
I miss Jiu.

00:56:05.200 --> 00:56:06.000
I miss him too.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Let him do his job first. 

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.000
When he finishes, he will pick us up. Hang in there. 

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000
You two must take care of each other.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Don't cry too loud. It's annoying.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Hey, talk nicely to the kids.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Don't worry, boy.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
I will take care of you. 

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Sir, that girl is addicted to opium and is now in serious condition.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Increase the quantity and take good care of her. 

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Increase too much will kill her.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Be careful.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
If those two kids are still with us, 

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Jiu will do anything for us.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Come in.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Come in.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000
What's wrong?

00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:43.000
Mr. Song would like to meet you and Jia.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Doctor Qi.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
What's wrong?

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Li, Jia. 

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Let me get this straight. 

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:33.000
I know about the blood sucking mushrooms and the beetle orchids already.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
What are you talking about? I don't get it. 

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000
The day before, I dug where the blood sucking mushrooms grew. 

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
I found this tooth.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
I had it checked by Doctor Qi.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
So I know that the owner of this tooth

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000
died because of the beetle orchids.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
You two used the beetle orchids to kill someone 

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
to hide Tian's secret, right?

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:28.000
No. 

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000
There's no secret at all.

00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.000
Stop lying.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
If you still have the dignity of the Song family's first madam…

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Li.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.000
What is Tian's secret?

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Why would you kill someone to cover up?

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000
It's because I'm the first madam, so I said this.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000
I didn't do anything wrong. Don't accuse me. 

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000
The evidence is in front of you. 

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
You still don't accept it?

01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:06.000
What's the evidence?

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:10.000
You found a tooth from someone's dead body and then accused me.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:20.000
How can a teacher not recognize his students' work?

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:26.000
The owner of this tooth died from being poisoned by the beetle orchid.

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Doctor.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
You might teach this knowledge to others.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Now, that person would probably frame me because he knew that I know about it. 

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.000
I taught you to use it to help people, not to hurt someone like this.

01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:45.000
And you are still not speaking the truth?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Bao.

01:00:53.200 --> 01:00:54.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Go to Jia's room. 

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Search for the beetle orchid. 

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:01.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
That servant. I let her find mushrooms. Where has she been now?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Will she get something?

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Doctor Qi.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:36.000
How did he come here?

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Something happens?

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Madam. 

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Nuan, I'm shocked.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:48.000
I saw … I saw…

01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:52.000
It doesn't matter bow. Something happens here. Let's go. Quickly.

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:53.000
Well...

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Madam. Alright. 

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Bao.

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Madam, Madam. 

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:09.000
There's nothing, Sir. 

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
I can't find the beetle orchid, Sir. 

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
I didn't find anything.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I told you that Jia and I didn't do it.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Or did you do it but cover it up completely?

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:11.000
If you think I did it, find the evidence.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Where did she hide the evidence?

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:17.000
I know. 

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
What?

01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.000
I'm going to tell you now.

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:24.000
You can't accuse me without any evidence like this.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.000
No witnesses, no evidence.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
I have one. 

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Chan.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Are you eavesdropping?

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.000
Please talk about manners later, Sir. 

01:04:45.300 --> 01:04:47.000
Now there's something bigger than that.

01:04:47.200 --> 01:04:50.000
Nuan, tell me what you saw.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:55.000
I saw Aunt Jia buried those orchids in the forest at the back of the house.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Madam wants to find out how Madam Li and Jia killed, 

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
but she let me find the mushrooms alone.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.000
You really want to die. 

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Don't talk nonsense.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Do you want to join Mr. Song to slander me?

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.000
Don't argue. 

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:11.000
Nuan, take me there now.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:12.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000
This way, please. 

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Bao. 

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Where is it?

01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.000
Here. 

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Wow, there are so many people. Will I have a chance to try?

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:24.000
You will, Mr. Yang.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
Everyone, stop. Stop!

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:29.000
Go to the forest at the back of our house now.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
The fact that Dong was killed is about to be revealed.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Madam Li did it all.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Mom, what are you doing?

01:07:42.300 --> 01:07:44.000
Yang, I didn't do anything.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
It's your madam.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
She killed Dong to hide a secret for Tian.

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:57.000
Today is the day that I will get the evidence to arrest her. 

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Let's work hard, Bao. 

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
I can remember. It's here. 

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Sir. 

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Chan. 

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Why did you call everyone?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000
I didn't. I just walked by and everyone follow me.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000
But that's good.

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:06.000
Everyone here will be able to see the evidence at the same time.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:10.000
What did Madam and Jia use to kill Dong?

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Chan. 

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Dong is dead because of Jia's bizarre insects. 

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.000
The corpse would be so strange that it couldn't be seen by others.

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.000
Therefore, they had to steal the body and buried it at the back of the house.

01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.000
And the mushrooms that all of you had

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:42.000
grew from Dong's corpse.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Huh? Mushrooms from Dong's corpse?

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Right.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:53.000
The mushrooms are from the orchid that we are about to see it together.

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
We’ve found the box, Sir.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000
This box is the one Jia buried.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000
We’ve found the box, Sir.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:48.000
This is…

01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:51.000
Who are they? Your kids?

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:53.000
Tian.
