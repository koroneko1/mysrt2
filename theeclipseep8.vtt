Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:20.751
When will you tell everyone the truth?

00:00:20.751 --> 00:00:24.000
I hope you aren’t brainwashed by Ayan yet.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.147
I’m still the same person.

00:00:25.147 --> 00:00:29.800
That notebook is a reminder of someone who has left this world.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.600
if you know who took it,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.811
please let me know.

00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:40.609
Are you avoiding me?

00:00:41.118 --> 00:00:42.078
I’m not.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.756
I just wanted to sit at the stern.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.694
Yeah?

00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:46.609
Yeah.

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.014
When you talk to me, look into my eyes.

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:02.551
All right.

00:01:55.953 --> 00:01:57.153
It’s time we go back.

00:02:16.678 --> 00:02:17.640
Akk.

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:23.335
Akk, wear your shoes first or your feet might hurt.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.104
Akk!

00:02:28.384 --> 00:02:29.500
Talk to me.

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:32.260
Let go of me.

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:34.119
I don’t want my parents to see us.

00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:42.242
Why didn’t you let me do it?

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.748
Nothing happened there.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:48.502
I think something happened, Akk.

00:02:49.547 --> 00:02:50.741
Your eyes

00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:53.318
and your body

00:02:54.703 --> 00:02:56.121
said something did happen.

00:02:58.694 --> 00:02:59.855
If it’s something to you, fine.

00:03:00.825 --> 00:03:01.955
It’s nothing to me.

00:03:05.995 --> 00:03:08.213
Are you going to deny everything?

00:03:12.637 --> 00:03:15.292
You have the right to follow your heart.

00:03:28.926 --> 00:03:30.441
I choose not to do it.

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.600
That’s my right too, isn't it?

00:03:32.954 --> 00:03:34.954
Don’t you talk to me about this again.

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:43.399
Akk.

00:05:23.983 --> 00:05:24.772
Who is it?

00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:27.195
Me.

00:05:31.347 --> 00:05:32.303
Shameless.

00:05:33.807 --> 00:05:36.015
Get out of here before my parents see you.

00:05:36.771 --> 00:05:37.633
Why, Akk?

00:05:38.771 --> 00:05:41.777
You keep saying you’re afraid people will see.

00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:44.030
What if they do?

00:05:44.663 --> 00:05:46.493
Can’t two male friends spend time together?

00:05:50.132 --> 00:05:50.987
I don’t know.

00:05:51.618 --> 00:05:52.763
But I’m not okay with it.

00:05:53.407 --> 00:05:54.551
Get out now.

00:05:54.551 --> 00:05:55.407
Hold on.

00:05:56.726 --> 00:05:58.556
Aren’t you going to ask me why I’m here?

00:05:59.081 --> 00:06:00.082
Why are you here?

00:06:02.313 --> 00:06:03.579
Can I borrow your underwear?

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:04.508
What?

00:06:07.186 --> 00:06:09.186
You’re not so much bigger than me.

00:06:09.744 --> 00:06:11.186
I guess we can share.

00:06:11.544 --> 00:06:12.417
Can I borrow yours?

00:06:12.417 --> 00:06:13.374
No.

00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:14.243
Borrow someone else’s.

00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:15.989
No, I’m borrowing yours.

00:06:22.637 --> 00:06:24.200
Don’t just rummage things.

00:06:24.493 --> 00:06:25.547
I’ll find it for you.

00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:36.980
Here.

00:06:50.968 --> 00:06:52.604
Shortstop, let go.

00:06:52.701 --> 00:06:53.800
Or I’ll punch you.

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.467
Look into my eyes, Akk.

00:06:58.965 --> 00:06:59.895
Do it.

00:07:02.065 --> 00:07:03.072
I won’t do it.

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:04.817
You must.

00:07:14.377 --> 00:07:18.875
Now tell me

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:20.824
how you feel.

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:54.060
I will tell you my feelings

00:07:55.379 --> 00:07:57.209
and you will tell me yours.

00:07:59.077 --> 00:07:59.814
Okay?

00:08:07.715 --> 00:08:09.594
It feels so good

00:08:12.115 --> 00:08:13.969
when I get to spend time with you like this.

00:08:18.315 --> 00:08:23.565
Your face is warm just like a warm cup of coffee.

00:08:29.772 --> 00:08:31.287
And I love it

00:08:33.911 --> 00:08:35.911
when I get to look you in the eyes.

00:08:42.103 --> 00:08:43.375
I want to kiss you.

00:08:46.312 --> 00:08:47.827
Can I kiss you?

00:08:57.639 --> 00:08:59.081
If you don’t like it,

00:08:59.689 --> 00:09:01.592
if you’re not okay, let me know.

00:09:03.705 --> 00:09:04.856
I’ll stop.

00:09:31.773 --> 00:09:37.121
Can you tell me now how you feel about me?

00:09:38.936 --> 00:09:39.820
Can you, Akk?

00:10:01.007 --> 00:10:01.826
I’m not like you.

00:10:02.214 --> 00:10:03.225
Do you hear me?

00:10:04.005 --> 00:10:05.229
I’m not like you.

00:10:05.643 --> 00:10:07.643
That’s not the answer, Akk.

00:10:08.322 --> 00:10:10.322
I didn’t ask if you were like me.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.749
I asked how you feel about me.

00:10:16.177 --> 00:10:17.571
Can you tell me?

00:10:30.578 --> 00:10:31.600
I can’t say it.

00:10:32.983 --> 00:10:33.961
I can’t do it.

00:10:41.319 --> 00:10:42.085
Okay.

00:10:44.001 --> 00:10:45.235
I get it.

00:10:46.463 --> 00:10:48.220
It must be hard for you.

00:10:51.618 --> 00:10:52.583
But I can wait.

00:10:54.887 --> 00:10:58.250
For you, I will wait no matter how long.

00:11:20.705 --> 00:11:21.515
Wat.

00:11:21.661 --> 00:11:22.220
Yeah.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.282
Do you remember what you said last night?

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:25.877
What did I say?

00:11:26.362 --> 00:11:27.280
You said

00:11:29.058 --> 00:11:30.480
I’m studying Film.

00:11:30.696 --> 00:11:31.993
This is my life.

00:11:32.446 --> 00:11:33.108
Huh?

00:11:34.325 --> 00:11:35.566
Did I say that?

00:11:36.134 --> 00:11:37.455
You did.

00:11:37.455 --> 00:11:38.647
Were you so drunk that you couldn’t remember anything?

00:11:39.745 --> 00:11:40.547
Holy shit!

00:11:41.129 --> 00:11:42.680
I thought it was a dream.

00:11:43.283 --> 00:11:44.507
Dream, my ass.

00:11:45.085 --> 00:11:46.066
I recorded a video.

00:11:46.066 --> 00:11:47.255
Should I show it to your mom?

00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:48.117
Hey!

00:11:48.869 --> 00:11:50.675
Don’t you dare, Namo!

00:11:51.258 --> 00:11:52.052
Hey!

00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:53.821
Namo!

00:11:53.967 --> 00:11:54.756
Hey!

00:11:55.379 --> 00:11:56.482
Don’t.

00:12:09.767 --> 00:12:10.601
What happened?

00:12:13.948 --> 00:12:16.642
Namo is making fun of Wat about last night.

00:12:16.837 --> 00:12:18.109
Wat is chasing him down.

00:12:20.495 --> 00:12:21.432
Um.

00:12:25.725 --> 00:12:26.715
Kan.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:29.513
Last night you…

00:12:29.513 --> 00:12:31.376
I slept like a log.

00:12:32.326 --> 00:12:34.035
Wat’s drink just knocked me out.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:36.932
You slept like a log too, didn't you?

00:12:37.225 --> 00:12:38.564
You were drooling in your sleep.

00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:42.451
Yes.

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.303
I was exhausted.

00:12:45.651 --> 00:12:47.505
I just drifted off.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.791
I’m done here.

00:12:55.131 --> 00:12:56.113
I’m leaving.

00:12:58.029 --> 00:12:58.952
Um.

00:13:10.757 --> 00:13:11.904
Another one.

00:13:13.194 --> 00:13:14.480
Stop playing.

00:13:20.121 --> 00:13:22.360
I came to talk about the Judo class.

00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.395
Do you want to pair with me?

00:13:39.445 --> 00:13:41.445
Food is ready.

00:13:41.766 --> 00:13:43.766
Enjoy.

00:13:44.274 --> 00:13:44.951
Wow!

00:13:46.738 --> 00:13:47.990
Finish it all.

00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.697
Sure.

00:13:50.886 --> 00:13:51.873
Guys!

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.532
Can I get a picture first?

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:55.805
Just a moment.

00:13:56.486 --> 00:13:58.716
You’ve been taking photos since yesterday.

00:13:58.716 --> 00:14:01.088
Just let me do it. We’re on a trip after all.

00:14:01.088 --> 00:14:02.525
Look into the camera.

00:14:02.975 --> 00:14:04.975
One, two, three.

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:07.124
Nice.

00:14:07.286 --> 00:14:08.369
One more.

00:14:09.286 --> 00:14:10.806
You all look great.

00:14:11.193 --> 00:14:12.902
One, two.

00:14:13.443 --> 00:14:15.028
Perfect!

00:14:15.826 --> 00:14:16.803
Kan,

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:19.286
can I get another one with the surrounding?

00:14:20.446 --> 00:14:21.887
Like that.

00:14:22.169 --> 00:14:23.269
Smile.

00:14:23.833 --> 00:14:24.553
Great.

00:14:25.575 --> 00:14:27.787
And this is the surrounding.

00:14:28.206 --> 00:14:28.863
Awesome.

00:14:28.863 --> 00:14:30.018
This guy is just too much.

00:14:40.684 --> 00:14:45.036
What your parents made is so good.

00:14:46.809 --> 00:14:47.633
Jackass.

00:14:47.868 --> 00:14:49.044
Stop playing.

00:14:52.529 --> 00:14:54.012
Well, it’s really good.

00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:57.120
Goodbye.

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.350
Drive safe.

00:14:58.350 --> 00:14:59.070
Of course.

00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:00.415
Goodbye, Mom.

00:15:00.791 --> 00:15:01.721
Bye, Dad.

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:04.004
Come home often.

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:04.970
Sure.

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:07.236
Take care, Mom, Dad

00:15:07.236 --> 00:15:08.006
Hold on.

00:15:08.779 --> 00:15:11.814
You drive and I’ll take photos.

00:15:11.955 --> 00:15:12.895
Okay?

00:15:12.989 --> 00:15:14.556
You’re useless, my friend.

00:15:14.556 --> 00:15:15.466
Be our driver.

00:15:17.747 --> 00:15:19.119
Save up if you can.

00:15:23.493 --> 00:15:24.209
Sorry.

00:15:34.375 --> 00:15:37.292
Aye, why are you huddling Thua?

00:15:37.418 --> 00:15:38.854
As if he’s not small enough.

00:15:39.918 --> 00:15:42.086
What am I supposed to do? We don’t have that much room back here.

00:15:42.202 --> 00:15:43.326
Sit on Akk’s lap.

00:15:43.326 --> 00:15:44.037
Okay.

00:15:44.448 --> 00:15:45.268
Kan!

00:15:45.268 --> 00:15:48.447
How about you ask me first if I want him to sit on my lap?

00:15:55.932 --> 00:15:58.073
We can sit like this. It’s fine.

00:16:00.847 --> 00:16:02.847
Drive already, Kan.

00:16:02.847 --> 00:16:04.117
It’s uncomfortable back here.

00:16:04.117 --> 00:16:05.154
Okay, guys.

00:16:05.310 --> 00:16:07.126
Let’s go.

00:16:20.259 --> 00:16:23.600
Don’t forget we have the mid-term exam next week.

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.079
Yes, ma’am.

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:28.114
Be prepared and study hard.

00:16:28.114 --> 00:16:29.326
And that’s all for today.

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:30.718
Class.

00:16:30.846 --> 00:16:33.415
Thank you, Teacher.

00:16:37.469 --> 00:16:38.340
Akk.

00:16:40.127 --> 00:16:40.927
Let go.

00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:45.871
What’s the matter, Akk?

00:16:47.058 --> 00:16:48.588
Ever since we got back from your home

00:16:50.947 --> 00:16:52.262
you’ve been avoiding me

00:16:53.414 --> 00:16:54.522
I’m not avoiding you.

00:16:55.887 --> 00:16:57.093
I’m a prefect.

00:16:57.206 --> 00:16:58.423
I’ve got many things to do.

00:17:01.545 --> 00:17:02.542
I’ll go make rounds.

00:17:03.177 --> 00:17:03.921
Akk.

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:07.601
Store my chair.

00:17:14.187 --> 00:17:16.928
Kan, Wat, time to make rounds.

00:17:32.376 --> 00:17:36.305
[Hi. How was your trip? You didn’t tell me about it.]

00:17:38.486 --> 00:17:42.391
[It was good. But there was something not good.]

00:17:46.781 --> 00:17:47.650
[What’s not?]

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:51.086
[Nothing.]

00:17:51.759 --> 00:17:56.675
[Do you think people forget everything they do when they’re drunk?]

00:17:56.675 --> 00:17:58.034
The head of class 6/1.

00:18:00.447 --> 00:18:01.521
When you’re done with your phone,

00:18:02.274 --> 00:18:03.012
put it away.

00:18:03.344 --> 00:18:04.850
Yes, sir. I’m sorry.

00:18:05.329 --> 00:18:07.047
It’s after school, sir.

00:18:07.569 --> 00:18:10.133
He needs his phone to contact his parents.

00:18:11.672 --> 00:18:12.731
I didn’t blame him.

00:18:13.692 --> 00:18:14.619
I just said,

00:18:14.995 --> 00:18:17.291
“When you’re done with your phone, put it away.”

00:18:18.265 --> 00:18:19.679
He’s the head of the class.

00:18:19.679 --> 00:18:21.300
So he needs to be a role model.

00:18:21.406 --> 00:18:22.771
But school is over.

00:18:22.891 --> 00:18:25.644
He can’t be head of the class all the time.

00:18:26.196 --> 00:18:28.925
Don’t be too disciplined, or you might lose your damn mind.

00:18:28.925 --> 00:18:29.784
Excuse me, sir.

00:18:30.252 --> 00:18:31.190
You’re on the school ground.

00:18:31.472 --> 00:18:33.098
Please be polite.

00:18:34.995 --> 00:18:36.387
Let’s go home, son.

00:18:36.528 --> 00:18:37.486
Goodbye, sir.

00:18:49.726 --> 00:18:51.279
[Don’t join the protest if you don’t want to be cursed.]

00:18:52.065 --> 00:18:53.486
Curse, my freaking ass!

00:18:54.418 --> 00:18:56.794
Is this rubbish still believed in these days?

00:18:58.659 --> 00:19:02.846
Was anyone impacted by the curse when you went here?

00:19:03.657 --> 00:19:04.763
I was.

00:19:09.544 --> 00:19:12.391
Back then, I was considered a misbehaving student.

00:19:12.523 --> 00:19:13.676
A misfit.

00:19:13.964 --> 00:19:15.964
Because I was the victim of that shitty curse.

00:19:18.853 --> 00:19:20.005
I know you’re in there.

00:19:21.487 --> 00:19:23.111
Come out to turn yourself in.

00:19:24.630 --> 00:19:27.241
So you can be free from the Suppalo curse.

00:19:27.907 --> 00:19:28.683
Come out.

00:19:32.493 --> 00:19:33.364
The lock.

00:19:40.904 --> 00:19:41.691
Hey!

00:19:42.044 --> 00:19:43.257
Let me out.

00:19:43.737 --> 00:19:45.619
Let me out, assholes.

00:19:46.993 --> 00:19:51.321
That curse tale began right after this school founded the Student Prefect Club.

00:19:52.802 --> 00:19:55.046
Didn’t it start way before that?

00:19:55.328 --> 00:19:56.037
No.

00:19:56.965 --> 00:19:57.850
And do you know

00:19:58.603 --> 00:20:00.446
who was the first head of student prefects?

00:20:01.632 --> 00:20:02.415
Who?

00:20:02.415 --> 00:20:04.385
Your dear Teacher Chadok.

00:20:24.751 --> 00:20:27.833
[What’s wrong? Why are you avoiding me?]

00:20:28.743 --> 00:20:29.990
[I’m worried.]

00:21:25.433 --> 00:21:26.291
Teacher Chadok.

00:21:27.655 --> 00:21:28.938
I checked the round schedule

00:21:29.574 --> 00:21:32.985
and wanted to see if student prefects are doing their duty.

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:36.202
We’re all doing our best, sir.

00:21:36.766 --> 00:21:37.610
Good.

00:21:39.691 --> 00:21:43.502
But you haven't come in recently to update me about the school situation.

00:21:46.943 --> 00:21:48.241
It’s near the exam.

00:21:49.182 --> 00:21:50.754
I’ve been studying quite hard.

00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:56.131
The School Foundation Day is approaching in a few days.

00:21:56.559 --> 00:21:58.865
Take care of the orderliness.

00:22:01.564 --> 00:22:02.617
Yes, sir.

00:22:03.346 --> 00:22:06.762
I'm nominating you as the Best Student,

00:22:06.994 --> 00:22:10.446
who will receive this year's scholarship to further your education in university.

00:22:10.446 --> 00:22:12.239
Like Mes, your senior.

00:22:16.531 --> 00:22:18.319
Take care of everything.

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:21.718
And the scholarship will be yours.

00:22:47.268 --> 00:22:48.332
Why didn’t you shoot?

00:22:48.826 --> 00:22:49.762
Timeout.

00:22:49.831 --> 00:22:50.879
Sub me.

00:22:55.653 --> 00:22:56.981
Are you okay?

00:22:57.127 --> 00:22:58.054
I am.

00:22:58.054 --> 00:22:58.845
It’s nothing.

00:23:00.832 --> 00:23:01.917
What is it?

00:23:03.634 --> 00:23:05.966
I came to talk about the Judo class.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:11.013
I don’t think I’ll survive it pairing with Namo.

00:23:12.338 --> 00:23:14.432
And the test is coming up.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.010
So I…

00:23:17.010 --> 00:23:18.126
Do you want to pair with me?

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.606
What about Namo?

00:23:22.809 --> 00:23:24.068
He can pair with Wat.

00:23:24.256 --> 00:23:25.446
Wat is good.

00:23:25.446 --> 00:23:26.331
He can help.

00:23:27.411 --> 00:23:28.203
Fine, then.

00:23:28.956 --> 00:23:30.893
Good. We’re all set.

00:23:31.603 --> 00:23:32.594
Thank you.

00:23:32.594 --> 00:23:34.086
I’m going home now.

00:23:34.615 --> 00:23:35.636
How?

00:23:36.059 --> 00:23:37.300
Your mom or your dad is picking you up?

00:23:37.745 --> 00:23:38.610
My mom.

00:23:39.198 --> 00:23:39.910
Okay.

00:23:39.910 --> 00:23:41.139
Get home safe.

00:23:41.445 --> 00:23:42.175
Bye.

00:23:43.568 --> 00:23:44.380
Um.

00:23:47.532 --> 00:23:48.344
I…

00:23:52.061 --> 00:23:53.026
See you.

00:24:01.926 --> 00:24:02.916
Where are you going?

00:24:03.245 --> 00:24:04.819
You guys play on. I’m leaving.

00:24:10.569 --> 00:24:14.662
[You asked if people forget things they do when they’re drunk.]

00:24:15.096 --> 00:24:16.066
[I don’t think so.]

00:24:20.446 --> 00:24:21.358
Thua.

00:24:21.664 --> 00:24:22.326
Hey.

00:24:23.729 --> 00:24:25.140
Not playing basketball anymore?

00:24:25.963 --> 00:24:26.905
No.

00:24:27.094 --> 00:24:28.233
It’s late.

00:24:28.233 --> 00:24:29.486
I think I’ll head home.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.155
[I think the same thing.]

00:24:41.613 --> 00:24:43.613
I guess Akk is messaging me.

00:24:48.629 --> 00:24:49.891
Why are you smiling?

00:24:52.243 --> 00:24:53.099
Am I?

00:24:53.428 --> 00:24:54.093
Yes.

00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.693
No, I’m not.

00:24:56.010 --> 00:24:58.010
You’re the one grinning to yourself.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:58.696
Who are you talking to?

00:24:59.778 --> 00:25:00.559
A friend.

00:25:04.981 --> 00:25:06.299
Kan, have you seen this?

00:25:06.735 --> 00:25:08.994
The World Remembers is announcing their new protest.

00:25:09.471 --> 00:25:10.765
Again?

00:25:11.252 --> 00:25:12.829
These guys just never quit.

00:25:13.441 --> 00:25:14.687
Don’t join them.

00:25:16.004 --> 00:25:17.322
Yeah, I know.

00:25:18.153 --> 00:25:20.446
You know I hate chaos.

00:25:21.193 --> 00:25:22.346
You’re thinking it right.

00:25:25.539 --> 00:25:29.350
I think it’s going to be bigger than any protest they’ve done.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:33.606
How are the prefects going to handle it?

00:25:35.651 --> 00:25:36.837
I don’t know yet.

00:25:37.825 --> 00:25:40.144
But I don’t think Akk will let anyone ruin the school's reputation.

00:25:42.952 --> 00:25:44.152
I don’t think he will either.

00:25:48.233 --> 00:25:50.045
Why are you standing on the crosswalk?

00:25:50.045 --> 00:25:50.670
Come on.

00:25:51.610 --> 00:25:53.751
You’re the one stopping me here.

00:25:54.252 --> 00:25:55.446
The cars might hit us.

00:25:59.697 --> 00:26:01.626
I’m waiting to hear your feelings.

00:26:02.414 --> 00:26:04.414
I don’t want to see you get hurt.

00:26:04.508 --> 00:26:05.376
It’s okay.

00:26:05.376 --> 00:26:06.593
I can bear the pain.

00:26:24.776 --> 00:26:25.779
That’s boring.

00:26:34.586 --> 00:26:35.292
Aye.

00:26:36.796 --> 00:26:38.765
Akk said he’s sick.

00:26:39.004 --> 00:26:40.406
He’s in the infirmary.

00:26:48.193 --> 00:26:49.068
Hey!

00:26:49.723 --> 00:26:50.848
Where are you going?

00:26:51.009 --> 00:26:52.527
Aunt Waree’s class is about to start.

00:26:59.682 --> 00:27:00.408
Kan.

00:27:01.333 --> 00:27:02.877
I think this is so weird.

00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:05.860
Before this, Akk was the one chasing Aye.

00:27:06.006 --> 00:27:08.777
Now Aye is chasing Akk instead.

00:27:10.841 --> 00:27:12.051
It’s not weird.

00:27:13.709 --> 00:27:15.097
I think I get Aye.

00:27:39.899 --> 00:27:40.812
How is he?

00:27:41.024 --> 00:27:43.059
He asked for some pills to take and slept.

00:27:43.225 --> 00:27:45.339
Please take care of your friend.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.455
Sure.

00:27:46.686 --> 00:27:47.310
Thank you.

00:28:18.125 --> 00:28:20.780
You’re big but sickly.

00:29:08.925 --> 00:29:10.655
I’m waiting to hear your feelings.

00:29:11.947 --> 00:29:13.793
Don’t die yet, Big Foot.

00:29:58.627 --> 00:29:59.817
Next pair.

00:30:07.549 --> 00:30:09.973
Wat, has he recovered?

00:30:10.301 --> 00:30:11.030
Exactly.

00:30:11.107 --> 00:30:11.754
Now.

00:30:11.899 --> 00:30:12.523
Begin!

00:30:17.565 --> 00:30:18.674
Why are you avoiding me?

00:30:20.775 --> 00:30:22.514
I’m waiting to hear your answer, Akk.

00:30:43.078 --> 00:30:44.866
We’re in Judo class. Focus.

00:30:47.795 --> 00:30:48.925
Enough.

00:30:50.988 --> 00:30:51.974
Next pair.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.388
Begin.

00:31:23.175 --> 00:31:23.950
Ouch!

00:31:25.659 --> 00:31:26.884
Damn you, Kanlong.

00:31:28.632 --> 00:31:29.501
Let me see.

00:31:31.718 --> 00:31:33.179
Don’t be such a baby.

00:31:35.156 --> 00:31:36.456
I thought you broke your arm.

00:31:37.323 --> 00:31:40.059
And why did you pull your punches?

00:31:40.314 --> 00:31:41.909
Were you afraid your boyfriend would get hurt?

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:48.035
Why?

00:31:48.478 --> 00:31:49.555
Do you have a problem?

00:31:51.534 --> 00:31:54.421
I’m taking Kanlong to the infirmary.

00:31:54.704 --> 00:31:55.348
Yeah.

00:31:55.521 --> 00:31:56.337
Go!

00:31:58.566 --> 00:32:00.219
Next pair.

00:32:13.716 --> 00:32:14.657
Stick out your arm.

00:32:17.973 --> 00:32:18.936
It will hurt just a bit.

00:32:26.096 --> 00:32:28.096
Your perfume smells nice.

00:32:29.732 --> 00:32:30.741
You can still smell it?

00:32:31.184 --> 00:32:32.426
I put it on hours ago.

00:32:34.591 --> 00:32:35.750
I thought it wore off.

00:32:36.887 --> 00:32:38.808
It’s pretty scentful. I can still scent it.

00:32:43.063 --> 00:32:44.532
I knew I must pair up with you for the Judo test.

00:32:45.708 --> 00:32:47.588
So I put some on. I was afraid I’d smell.

00:32:49.171 --> 00:32:50.323
You’re too much.

00:32:54.295 --> 00:32:55.163
Kan,

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:59.187
next time, do not go soft on me like that.

00:33:00.429 --> 00:33:03.200
And don’t pretend to get thrown because I was capable of it.

00:33:04.806 --> 00:33:06.806
I don’t want to see you get hurt.

00:33:08.664 --> 00:33:09.458
It’s okay.

00:33:09.554 --> 00:33:10.760
I can bear the pain.

00:33:13.585 --> 00:33:14.308
Besides,

00:33:16.159 --> 00:33:17.436
I just wanted to protect you.

00:33:28.659 --> 00:33:29.299
Thua,

00:33:29.916 --> 00:33:30.852
are you okay?

00:33:32.105 --> 00:33:32.854
I am.

00:33:35.611 --> 00:33:36.589
Are you okay now?

00:33:39.707 --> 00:33:40.357
I am.

00:33:41.572 --> 00:33:42.402
Are you sure?

00:33:42.645 --> 00:33:43.623
Yes.

00:33:48.207 --> 00:33:53.234
My informant told me the consultant of that gang is Ayan.

00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:56.280
Have you got any more evidence?

00:33:56.914 --> 00:33:57.490
Any video,

00:33:58.203 --> 00:33:58.864
pictures,

00:33:59.365 --> 00:34:00.244
or anything.

00:34:02.419 --> 00:34:03.462
I’m trying.

00:34:04.419 --> 00:34:05.723
Try harder, Akk.

00:34:06.495 --> 00:34:08.495
You’re the president of the Prefect Club.

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:10.732
Yes, sir.

00:34:13.966 --> 00:34:15.531
We’ve let this problem continue for too long already.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:19.347
It’s time to nip it in the bud.

00:34:20.393 --> 00:34:22.566
Before something worse is going to happen to Suppalo.

00:34:32.641 --> 00:34:33.393
Akk.

00:34:35.089 --> 00:34:39.036
Whatever you decide to do, you know I’m on your side.

00:34:39.416 --> 00:34:40.739
Can you leave this school?

00:35:21.624 --> 00:35:23.374
Stop following me already, Mo.

00:35:30.554 --> 00:35:32.191
You always catch me.

00:35:32.393 --> 00:35:34.234
Perfectly fit to be my idol.

00:35:36.149 --> 00:35:37.604
Don’t make me your idol.

00:35:38.054 --> 00:35:38.894
Please.

00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:40.863
Don’t be humble.

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:44.574
You’re the best in this school right now.

00:35:44.972 --> 00:35:48.054
You’re smart and head of the Prefect Club.

00:35:52.775 --> 00:35:54.020
Did you hear anything there?

00:35:56.675 --> 00:35:57.657
No.

00:35:57.968 --> 00:35:58.872
Nothing.

00:35:58.872 --> 00:35:59.786
I swear.

00:36:03.246 --> 00:36:03.844
Alright.

00:36:04.048 --> 00:36:05.450
Now go. I’m going back to my dorm.

00:36:06.771 --> 00:36:07.532
Akk.

00:36:09.211 --> 00:36:13.446
Whatever you decide to do, you know I’m on your side.

00:37:02.537 --> 00:37:04.719
[“Why did you do that to me, Chadok?”]

00:37:07.574 --> 00:37:10.754
[I attempted suicide twice (many years ago).

00:37:10.901 --> 00:37:14.467
[It could be caused by a great deal of self-disappointment.]

00:37:35.633 --> 00:37:36.674
I think

00:37:37.633 --> 00:37:39.591
it’s time you let Uncle Di go.

00:37:48.667 --> 00:37:49.670
Not yet.

00:37:51.985 --> 00:37:57.362
I must know what this school did to him.

00:37:59.536 --> 00:38:02.784
You think if he’s still here,

00:38:03.878 --> 00:38:07.376
would he want his dear nephew to do this?

00:38:17.125 --> 00:38:19.874
But if we didn’t leave him alone at that moment,

00:38:21.025 --> 00:38:24.432
if we could stop him…

00:38:24.432 --> 00:38:27.556
Aye, stop blaming yourself.

00:38:29.304 --> 00:38:31.054
We did our best.

00:38:35.773 --> 00:38:37.773
You read this journal before.

00:38:39.848 --> 00:38:44.866
Didn’t you see he was doing better on his depressive disorder?

00:38:57.033 --> 00:38:58.942
And when it was time he wished to go,

00:39:02.654 --> 00:39:04.200
we couldn’t stop him.

00:39:06.946 --> 00:39:07.746
Right?

00:39:35.621 --> 00:39:36.365
Aye.

00:39:37.918 --> 00:39:40.536
You’re not leaving me too, are you?

00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.233
No.

00:39:56.115 --> 00:39:57.606
I won’t leave you, Mom.

00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.609
That school can’t do anything to me.

00:40:07.727 --> 00:40:08.691
I love you.

00:40:09.962 --> 00:40:11.248
I love you too.

00:40:12.786 --> 00:40:13.570
Mom,

00:40:15.317 --> 00:40:19.370
there’s still one person I’m worried about.

00:40:29.471 --> 00:40:30.550
Take back your hoodie.

00:40:32.025 --> 00:40:33.945
No. You can keep it.

00:40:34.095 --> 00:40:35.437
I bought a new one.

00:40:35.919 --> 00:40:37.624
In case you want to wear couple hoodies.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.632
Stop bugging me for once, will you?

00:40:40.033 --> 00:40:41.420
I’m not bugging you.

00:40:41.542 --> 00:40:42.382
I’m serious.

00:40:42.643 --> 00:40:44.711
You even let me borrow your underwear.

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:46.238
That’s different.

00:40:46.494 --> 00:40:49.042
I won’t wear it even if you return it to me.

00:40:53.055 --> 00:40:54.329
Let’s talk about your business.

00:40:59.353 --> 00:41:00.876
Can you leave this school?

00:41:04.118 --> 00:41:05.103
What the hell are you saying?

00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:07.457
I’m being serious.

00:41:08.954 --> 00:41:10.409
Ever since you joined,

00:41:10.729 --> 00:41:12.411
my school has been full of chaos.

00:41:12.927 --> 00:41:14.723
The protest is getting bigger.

00:41:15.015 --> 00:41:18.054
I think if you quit, things will get back to the way there were.

00:41:18.054 --> 00:41:21.351
Even without me, your school will never be the same.

00:41:22.255 --> 00:41:24.981
The problem in your school is with the system.

00:41:25.252 --> 00:41:28.182
It’s the constructal problem that’s been going on for years.

00:41:28.182 --> 00:41:30.155
It’s not about any individual.

00:41:30.382 --> 00:41:31.565
Don’t you get it?

00:41:32.979 --> 00:41:34.367
But if you don’t leave,

00:41:34.866 --> 00:41:36.408
the curse will come back.

00:41:37.513 --> 00:41:38.266
Hold on.

00:41:41.647 --> 00:41:43.552
You promised me

00:41:44.209 --> 00:41:45.801
you would stop this shit.

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:49.723
Who is forcing you?

00:41:50.014 --> 00:41:50.930
No one.

00:41:51.913 --> 00:41:54.049
I’m just doing my duty. That’s all.

00:41:55.959 --> 00:41:57.209
Is it Teacher Chadok?

00:41:58.548 --> 00:41:59.979
He’s forcing you to do this.

00:41:59.979 --> 00:42:01.180
No one is.

00:42:01.907 --> 00:42:05.677
This is the only way to keep Suppalo rules in place.

00:42:06.562 --> 00:42:08.054
Prove it to me then.

00:42:08.659 --> 00:42:10.659
Prove it Teacher Chadok didn’t make you do this.

00:42:11.692 --> 00:42:12.569
Prove?

00:42:12.773 --> 00:42:13.896
How?

00:42:34.185 --> 00:42:35.241
I don’t think we should do this.

00:42:36.784 --> 00:42:38.295
It’s too risky.

00:42:39.312 --> 00:42:40.949
The teachers will be here soon.

00:42:41.706 --> 00:42:44.977
Because you won’t admit Teacher Chadok is behind everything,

00:42:46.527 --> 00:42:47.880
I have to find the evidence myself.

00:42:49.083 --> 00:42:50.456
Watch the door for me.

00:42:51.545 --> 00:42:52.270
Okay?

00:42:55.165 --> 00:42:55.877
Fine.

00:43:37.138 --> 00:43:38.298
Are you done?

00:43:50.298 --> 00:43:50.987
Hey.

00:43:50.987 --> 00:43:51.799
Thua is here.

00:44:02.507 --> 00:44:03.203
Hey.

00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:04.530
Akk. Aye.

00:44:06.535 --> 00:44:07.841
Are you turning in the assignments, Thua?

00:44:08.181 --> 00:44:08.875
Yes.

00:44:09.307 --> 00:44:11.012
What are you doing here so early?

00:44:13.597 --> 00:44:15.040
I was just turning in my assignment too.

00:44:15.774 --> 00:44:16.966
Why didn’t you leave it with me?

00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:20.172
Right.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:22.226
Why didn’t you hand it to Thua?

00:44:22.226 --> 00:44:24.619
So I didn’t have to guard you from copying someone else’s assignment.

00:44:26.432 --> 00:44:27.161
Right.

00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:31.599
Hey!

00:44:32.847 --> 00:44:33.886
I’m sorry.

00:44:34.516 --> 00:44:35.948
- Are you okay?
- It’s okay.

00:44:36.313 --> 00:44:37.836
They’re scattering everywhere.

00:44:57.318 --> 00:44:58.478
What are you three doing in here?

00:45:07.577 --> 00:45:14.660
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

00:45:14.865 --> 00:45:16.865
All you think about is work?

00:45:16.865 --> 00:45:18.696
Don’t you want any good moments with me at all?

00:45:19.847 --> 00:45:21.427
The World Remembers is stirring things up again.

00:45:21.427 --> 00:45:26.158
We seek out the truth because the school board lacks integrity.

00:45:26.158 --> 00:45:29.358
Every student prefect must be strict on their watch.

00:45:29.358 --> 00:45:32.111
We can’t let them protest outside the school.

00:45:33.871 --> 00:45:35.174
Did you do it?

00:45:35.174 --> 00:45:37.006
Do you really think I want my school to look bad?

00:45:37.006 --> 00:45:39.380
Do you realize you’ve changed?
