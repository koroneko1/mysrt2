Yes, it's black.

00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,800
Bear, can I take a photo with you?

173
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,732
Sure.

174
00:11:15,139 --> 00:11:16,166
Thank you so much.

175
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:16,840
Thank you.

176
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,563
Should we call you Boss Bomb now?

177
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,713
Boss what?

178
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:26,009
You're being so extra.

179
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,580
Back in the day, all you cared about was lotto.

180
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Who would have thought you'd win it for real?

181
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,978
And he won the first prize too.

182
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:36,400
When it was announced, he cried like a river.

183
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,009
I got the winning number from Mek's license plate.

184
00:11:42,643 --> 00:11:43,880
Lee...

185
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,505
We're here to party.

186
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:46,748
Stop working!

187
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,245
Just a minute.

188
00:11:48,245 --> 00:11:50,000
I need to send this to the photographer today.

189
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,732
Actually, on the set where I assisted today...

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,295
I met Tim.

191
00:11:55,295 --> 00:11:56,500
He was the model.

192
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
Seems like he's still doing his channel.

193
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,300
Does that mean he's not working for his family hotel anymore?

194
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,300
Perhaps he wants to do something on his own.

195
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,368
His channel is quite popular.

196
00:12:06,368 --> 00:12:08,600
But not as popular as Bear's Experiment, I'm sure.

197
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,300
You see the people who come to this bar?

198
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,300
All of them are your fans.

199
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,300
If I ever break up with you,

200
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,300
my bar will be out of business.

201
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,900
Bomb, don't you ever think that way.

202
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,748
They come here because it's a good bar.

203
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,700
Stop thinking that way, okay?

204
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,560
Believe in yourself.

205
00:12:34,996 --> 00:12:36,109
Understood?

206
00:12:36,109 --> 00:12:36,940
Yeah.

207
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,850
What about you?

208
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,500
How was your first day at work?

209
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,989
Still need to adjust.

210
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,652
It was tough.

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,582
Just take it easy, my friend.

212
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,211
Don't be stressed.

213
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:55,633
Alright.

214
00:12:56,074 --> 00:12:57,302
Let's drink.

215
00:12:57,465 --> 00:12:58,640
Come on!

216
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,000
Wait, wait, wait!

217
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Wait for me!

218
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,306
Park!

219
00:13:03,608 --> 00:13:05,000
Come on in.

220
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,327
Now, see this!

221
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey, wait.

222
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:18,361
You got a new haircut?

223
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,000
Yeah.

224
00:13:19,450 --> 00:13:20,919
How do I look?
Good?

225
00:13:21,082 --> 00:13:22,465
Can I have a look at the back?

226
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,397
You're right.
It looks good.

227
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,905
Bear, check that out.

228
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,236
Cheers!

229
00:13:32,236 --> 00:13:33,131
Yeah!

230
00:13:33,131 --> 00:13:33,946
Hold up.

231
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,755
What are we celebrating anyway?

232
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,689
We're celebrating...

233
00:13:38,689 --> 00:13:40,555
the fact that Kim got his new job.

234
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,100
After he's been finding a job for so long.

235
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,500
Okay, cheers!

236
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,689
Cheers!

237
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm sure one day your dad will understand
and accept the path you choose.

238
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,600
Until that day comes,
I'll always be here for you....

239
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,982
and support you like I always do.

240
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,160
Are you sure you can carry him home?

241
00:14:39,849 --> 00:14:40,960
Yeah.

242
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:43,738
I've been through tougher situations.

243
00:14:44,349 --> 00:14:45,660
What kind of situation?

244
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:47,922
Mama Bear, you don't need to know that.

245
00:14:47,922 --> 00:14:49,149
Just let them go home.

246
00:14:49,849 --> 00:14:51,204
It's late.
There might be no cab to call.

247
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:55,893
Bear, have you been in touch with Mek lately?

248
00:14:56,649 --> 00:14:58,338
He's been busy.

249
00:14:58,338 --> 00:14:59,851
He said he had a lot of work.

250
00:14:59,851 --> 00:15:01,716
A lot of projects to do.

251
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:03,760
I miss him.

252
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:08,749
I thought he'd come back once he finished his degree.

253
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,760
Instead, he stayed there for so long.

254
00:15:12,349 --> 00:15:13,365
Yeah.

255
00:15:13,543 --> 00:15:15,327
Perhaps he likes kangaroos.

256
00:15:16,572 --> 00:15:17,535
Kangaroos?

257
00:15:20,849 --> 00:15:21,916
What's wrong with you?

258
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:27,271
I feel heavy now.

259
00:15:28,849 --> 00:15:29,865
Well...

260
00:15:29,865 --> 00:15:30,969
Let's say goodbye from here.

261
00:15:30,969 --> 00:15:31,749
Okay.

262
00:15:32,549 --> 00:15:33,609
See you later, Kim.

263
00:15:34,449 --> 00:15:35,371
Bye.

264
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:43,538
You think they're gonna make it home?

265
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:53,027
Kim, can you go home on your own?

266
00:15:53,249 --> 00:15:54,844
If not, you can stay with me.

267
00:15:54,844 --> 00:15:55,782
It's okay.

268
00:15:56,149 --> 00:15:57,049
I'm totally fine.

269
00:15:59,549 --> 00:16:01,016
My car's here.

270
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:02,867
Okay, go home safe.

271
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:04,649
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

272
00:16:05,249 --> 00:16:06,671
- Bye.
- Bye.

273
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:07,867
Bye-bye.

274
00:16:15,749 --> 00:16:17,116
"How was your first day at work?"

275
00:16:18,849 --> 00:16:19,971
"Pretty tough."

276
00:16:19,971 --> 00:16:21,971
"I still have a lot to learn."

277
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:23,514
"That's normal."

278
00:16:23,514 --> 00:16:24,649
"This thing takes time."

279
00:16:24,649 --> 00:16:26,149
"Don't pressure yourself too much."

280
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:27,543
"Thanks."

281
00:16:27,543 --> 00:16:29,160
"What about you, Tim?
How's your channel going?"

282
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:30,893
"It's going fine."

283
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:44,771
What have you been doing lately?

284
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:46,549
Well...

285
00:16:47,149 --> 00:16:49,289
I'm working on my channel just like before.

286
00:16:49,749 --> 00:16:51,416
Have you ever thought of coming to help me at our hotel?

287
00:16:57,449 --> 00:16:59,249
I don't want to do it, dad.

288
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:02,249
I didn't ask you whether you want to do it or not.

289
00:17:04,149 --> 00:17:05,704
No matter what, you must do it.

290
00:17:06,149 --> 00:17:08,649
I don't trust anyone to do it but you.

291
00:17:11,749 --> 00:17:13,004
I only have you.

292
00:17:15,749 --> 00:17:18,449
Stop making those non-sense contents already.

293
00:17:20,049 --> 00:17:20,893
No.

294
00:17:23,149 --> 00:17:25,204
I built it myself from the ground up.

295
00:17:27,249 --> 00:17:28,569
Just like what you did with your hotel.

296
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,649
Tim!

297
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:31,771
I will prove it to you...

298
00:17:32,649 --> 00:17:34,127
that what I do...

299
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,549
is not worthless.

300
00:17:36,727 --> 00:17:38,371
All my life...

301
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,349
you and mom always chose the path for me
and it's enough.

302
00:17:42,049 --> 00:17:43,571
Now I want to choose my own path.

303
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:55,916
Please excuse me.

304
00:18:37,671 --> 00:18:38,982
You gave me a fright.

305
00:18:42,349 --> 00:18:43,569
What happened?

306
00:18:43,569 --> 00:18:44,782
Just same old stuff.

307
00:18:45,549 --> 00:18:46,749
With your dad again?

308
00:18:48,449 --> 00:18:49,809
Do you want me to talk to him?

309
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:51,738
He wouldn't understand.

310
00:18:53,949 --> 00:18:55,171
I'll handle it myself.

311
00:18:59,749 --> 00:19:01,038
It's okay.

312
00:19:02,449 --> 00:19:04,149
I'm sure one day your dad will understand

313
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:06,749
and accept the path you choose.

314
00:19:08,449 --> 00:19:09,767
Until that day comes...

315
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,693
I'll be here for you...

316
00:19:13,449 --> 00:19:15,182
and support you like I always do.

317
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:18,049
I don't know what to say to you

318
00:19:19,949 --> 00:19:21,649
except thank you...

319
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:24,338
and thank you.

320
00:19:25,449 --> 00:19:26,756
What's this?

321
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:28,393
Are you feeling sentimental lately?

322
00:19:30,549 --> 00:19:31,649
Nope.

323
00:19:32,349 --> 00:19:33,649
I really mean it.

324
00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:36,649
Ever since the day you became my friend

325
00:19:37,449 --> 00:19:39,349
all the way until today...

326
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:43,149
you've always been by my side.

327
00:19:45,449 --> 00:19:47,593
You always support me on whatever I want to do

328
00:19:48,449 --> 00:19:49,771
among other things.

329
00:19:53,449 --> 00:19:55,516
You made me feel like I'm the luckiest man.

330
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:01,116
For that, I thank you.

331
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:03,360
Come on.

332
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:05,405
Don't be so sentimental.

333
00:20:05,849 --> 00:20:07,849
You're gonna make me cry.

334
00:20:10,349 --> 00:20:11,922
I'm tired.

335
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,393
Can I recharge my battery?

336
00:20:26,449 --> 00:20:28,949
With a power source like you,
I can never get enough.

337
00:20:51,449 --> 00:20:52,571
Kim.

338
00:20:52,949 --> 00:20:54,649
Why do you come home so late?

339
00:20:54,838 --> 00:20:56,169
I went to Bomb's bar earlier.

340
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:58,982
You went to party with your friends?

341
00:21:00,749 --> 00:21:01,569
Yes.

342
00:21:02,849 --> 00:21:03,618
And...

343
00:21:03,618 --> 00:21:05,216
How are you today?

344
00:21:05,849 --> 00:21:07,329
How was your first day at work?

345
00:21:07,949 --> 00:21:11,250
What is your job position?
Which company do you work for?

346
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,489
I'm just a regular office worker.

347
00:21:19,249 --> 00:21:20,326
Do they pay you well?

348
00:21:20,326 --> 00:21:21,471
Can I be excused?

349
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:23,712
I have to wake up early tomorrow.

350
00:21:23,823 --> 00:21:24,960
Kim, wait.

351
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,160
Do you want anything special for breakfast?

352
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,340
Whatever Q likes.

353
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:29,349
I can eat everything.

354
00:21:59,099 --> 00:22:00,156
Honey.

355
00:22:00,534 --> 00:22:01,938
Why don't you come to bed?

356
00:22:02,949 --> 00:22:04,649
I'm thinking about Kim.

357
00:22:06,649 --> 00:22:09,193
Do you think I'm a bad mother?

358
00:22:10,549 --> 00:22:12,638
It's his first day at work
and I didn't know.

359
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:13,998
No, you're not.

360
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:16,327
You just found out a little late.
That's all.

361
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,849
I'm afraid that he and I are getting estranged.

362
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:22,649
And he's a person who thinks a lot about everything.

363
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:24,244
Don't worry.

364
00:22:24,244 --> 00:22:25,716
Kim is all grown up now.

365
00:22:26,049 --> 00:22:29,049
He's at the age where he would want
to make decisions himself.

366
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:32,049
You can't treat him like a child anymore.

367
00:22:32,449 --> 00:22:35,827
If he wants to tell you something, he'll tell you.

368
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:37,929
You really think so?

369
00:22:44,149 --> 00:22:48,905
When you make a proposal for a client,
you need to have a main idea first.

370
00:22:48,905 --> 00:22:51,149
You must study the client.

371
00:22:51,149 --> 00:22:52,770
Learn about what they want.

372
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:55,603
Then list them out.
One, two, three, four, five.

373
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:57,429
- One, two, three, four, five.
- Exactly.

374
00:22:57,429 --> 00:22:58,129
Make a list.

375
00:22:58,129 --> 00:22:59,305
Yes, like that.

376
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:01,101
Kim.

377
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,260
I have a big assignment for you.

378
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,649
I want you to be in charge of Mr. Mega's account.

379
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:08,749
You must take on this client.

380
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:11,049
And your probation will be evaluated by it.

381
00:23:11,749 --> 00:23:13,293
I'll give you his contact info.

382
00:23:13,649 --> 00:23:15,227
You can reach him right after.

383
00:23:15,949 --> 00:23:17,649
You think you can handle it?

384
00:23:17,649 --> 00:23:18,649
Yes, I can.

385
00:23:23,816 --> 00:23:24,649
Nui.

386
00:23:24,649 --> 00:23:25,576
Hmm?

387
00:23:25,649 --> 00:23:27,360
Do you know who this Mega guy is?

388
00:23:28,749 --> 00:23:31,649
Mr. Mega is a landscape artist.

389
00:23:31,749 --> 00:23:34,549
But no one has ever seen his face.

390
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:38,089
I heard he's a difficult to work with.

391
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:41,129
And most importantly, he's very thorough.

392
00:23:43,049 --> 00:23:44,649
What should I do?

393
00:23:45,349 --> 00:23:48,049
It's my first account and I already got a tough client.

394
00:23:49,004 --> 00:23:50,396
Darling.

395
00:23:50,396 --> 00:23:51,769
Don't lose your confidence just yet.

396
00:23:51,769 --> 00:23:53,649
When you work for tough clients,

397
00:23:53,649 --> 00:23:55,649
you need to think harder.

398
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:58,071
Try to figure out how you can win him over.

399
00:23:58,649 --> 00:23:59,967
I've been there.

400
00:23:59,967 --> 00:24:01,449
WIth tough clients,

401
00:24:01,449 --> 00:24:04,360
once you understand their nature...

402
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,282
things will get easier.

403
00:24:07,349 --> 00:24:09,649
But I've never had such experience.

404
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:11,649
There's always a first time for everything.

405
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:13,649
I believe you can do it.

406
00:24:13,649 --> 00:24:14,645
Don't give up.

407
00:24:14,645 --> 00:24:15,649
Fighto!

408
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:17,860
Fighto!

409
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,282
That's the right attitude!

410
00:24:19,282 --> 00:24:19,978
Okay.

411
00:24:20,049 --> 00:24:21,160
Go on.

412
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:22,765
Do what I taught you.

413
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:30,928
Landscape.

414
00:24:34,106 --> 00:24:37,557
[An up-and-coming landscape artist
who made a debut in Australia.
He never shows his face to the press.]

415
00:24:48,889 --> 00:24:50,389
"Dear Mr. Mega,"

416
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:51,771
"My name is Kimhan."

417
00:24:51,771 --> 00:24:53,949
"I'll be your coordinator for this project."

418
00:24:54,282 --> 00:24:56,282
"If there's anything you need,"

419
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:58,016
"please don't hesitate to let me know."

420
00:24:58,449 --> 00:25:00,149
"Best regards,
Kimhan."

421
00:25:15,449 --> 00:25:16,704
Kimhan!

422
00:25:19,449 --> 00:25:20,649
Yes, Orn.

423
00:25:20,849 --> 00:25:22,649
Did you send an e-mail to Mr. Mega?

424
00:25:22,849 --> 00:25:24,649
Y...yes.

425
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:25,844
What's wrong with it?

426
00:25:25,844 --> 00:25:27,316
Did you know he filed a complaint?

427
00:25:27,316 --> 00:25:29,289
You didn't check the time to be in contact with him.

428
00:25:29,289 --> 00:25:32,834
Didn't I tell you to study him first!?

429
00:25:33,349 --> 00:25:35,149
The time in Australia now is...

430
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:36,281
He's in the U.S. now.

431
00:25:36,281 --> 00:25:38,271
He's having an exhibition in New York.

432
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:41,849
Next time, if you don't know, ask me first.

433
00:25:41,849 --> 00:25:43,689
So you don't make a mess like this again.

434
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:47,409
I am sorry.

435
00:26:10,749 --> 00:26:12,529
How was your work today?

436
00:26:13,449 --> 00:26:14,505
It was good.

437
00:26:31,249 --> 00:26:32,009
Kim.

438
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:33,982
I know you're tired. Come eat this.

439
00:26:33,982 --> 00:26:35,649
I made you your favorite dish.

440
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:37,338
It's fine.
I already had a meal.

441
00:26:38,949 --> 00:26:39,793
Kim.

442
00:27:14,505 --> 00:27:17,149
He told me his flight is tomorrow.

443
00:27:17,149 --> 00:27:18,161
Not anymore.

444
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,149
He'll have a meeting with us today.

445
00:27:50,468 --> 00:27:52,849
"When will you be home?"

446
00:28:13,568 --> 00:28:16,041
Babe, why do you come home so late?

447
00:28:19,968 --> 00:28:21,877
I've just finished my editing.

448
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:26,343
You must be exhausted.

449
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:30,534
Come.

450
00:28:31,541 --> 00:28:33,533
Let me make you feel better.

451
00:28:39,668 --> 00:28:40,942
I can't. I'm too tired.

452
00:28:47,468 --> 00:28:49,069
You don't have to do anything.

453
00:28:50,468 --> 00:28:51,960
I'll do it for you.

454
00:29:05,168 --> 00:29:06,697
I'm really tired, babe.

455
00:29:07,768 --> 00:29:08,797
Let's do it another time.

456
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:14,616
Okay.

457
00:29:15,468 --> 00:29:17,867
Thanks for understanding.

458
00:29:38,168 --> 00:29:39,196
I'll go take a shower.

459
00:30:17,559 --> 00:30:19,360
Is the meal too bland?

460
00:30:19,968 --> 00:30:20,779
It's okay.

461
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:21,832
- Not too bland?
- Nope.

462
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:24,296
Kim.

463
00:30:24,468 --> 00:30:25,440
You're heading out now?

464
00:30:26,168 --> 00:30:27,013
Yes, dad.

465
00:30:27,013 --> 00:30:28,468
Have breakfast with us first.

466
00:30:30,668 --> 00:30:31,667
No, thank you.

467
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,468
Let's have dinner together then.

468
00:30:33,968 --> 00:30:34,948
I don't think I can.

469
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:37,508
Is there anything troubling you?

470
00:30:37,868 --> 00:30:38,661
No.

471
00:30:39,567 --> 00:30:40,668
You don't have to worry, mom.

472
00:30:41,568 --> 00:30:42,468
Kim.

473
00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:45,458
If work is too much, you can take a break.

474
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:47,395
I said I'm okay.

475
00:30:51,968 --> 00:30:53,062
Please excuse me.

476
00:30:57,468 --> 00:30:59,196
He's probably in a hurry.

477
00:30:59,468 --> 00:31:00,942
Come on, honey, let's finish this up.

478
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:01,947
Don't think too much.

479
00:31:20,168 --> 00:31:21,357
Kim.

480
00:31:21,701 --> 00:31:23,712
Why didn't you pick up Mr. Mega yesterday?

481
00:31:27,168 --> 00:31:28,188
Pick up?

482
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:30,748
Pick him up where?

483
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:32,840
At the airport, of course!

484
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,788
Do I have to tell you everything?

485
00:31:35,068 --> 00:31:38,449
He made a complaint again
because no one was there to take care of him.

486
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:43,349
He told me his flight would land tomorrow.

487
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:44,968
And that he would come directly to our meeting.

488
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:48,015
Not anymore.

489
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,113
He'll come and have a meeting with us today.

490
00:31:52,115 --> 00:31:53,861
Oh, here he is.

491
00:32:10,948 --> 00:32:13,439
Mr. Mega, please have a seat.

492
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,768
Our boss will be here in a few minutes.

493
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:22,068
Mr. Rich, this is Mr. Mega, our new client.

494
00:32:22,768 --> 00:32:24,468
You can call me Mek.

495
00:32:25,168 --> 00:32:25,865
Oh.

496
00:32:25,865 --> 00:32:27,992
Why do you use the name "Mega" then?

497
00:32:31,968 --> 00:32:33,805
It comes from my first name, Meka.

498
00:32:34,768 --> 00:32:37,885
Let me start by introducing our team.

499
00:32:38,168 --> 00:32:40,068
This is Mr. Rich, our big boss.

500
00:32:40,468 --> 00:32:42,340
On this side, this is Kimhan.

501
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:44,758
Our new AE who will be taking care of you.

502
00:32:45,468 --> 00:32:46,832
Nice to meet you, Mr. Rich.

503
00:32:47,068 --> 00:32:48,720
Nice to meet you...

504
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,676
Mr. Kimhan.

505
00:32:51,268 --> 00:32:52,287
Nice to meet you.

506
00:32:55,068 --> 00:32:56,359
Pleased to meet you too, Mr. Mek.

507
00:32:57,268 --> 00:33:00,168
I'm so delighted to have you as our client.

508
00:33:00,568 --> 00:33:01,979
I'm gonna need a lot of your help.

509
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:04,160
And I expect a lot from you guys.

510
00:33:04,868 --> 00:33:06,468
You don't need to worry.

511
00:33:06,868 --> 00:33:08,468
Anything you want,

512
00:33:08,468 --> 00:33:10,468
you can let our team know right away.

513
00:33:10,468 --> 00:33:12,468
I want to raise public awareness on my work.

514
00:33:12,468 --> 00:33:14,468
My trees. My gardens.

515
00:33:14,468 --> 00:33:16,087
Not who I am.

516
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:18,631
As you know, I want to keep my identity private.

517
00:33:18,868 --> 00:33:19,583
Sure.

518
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:21,388
Our team will work on that.

519
00:33:54,768 --> 00:33:56,405
It's my pleasure to work with you.

520
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:09,768
I'm looking forward to our collaboration, Kimhan.

521
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:11,895
From now, I'm gonna need a lot of support from you.

522
00:34:27,068 --> 00:34:28,968
"Can I have today's meeting report?"

523
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:32,442
"I already sent it to you."

524
00:34:35,068 --> 00:34:36,152
"I can't find it."

525
00:34:36,152 --> 00:34:37,708
"Can you send it to me again?"

526
00:34:39,968 --> 00:34:41,605
"Can't you wait until tomorrow?"

527
00:34:48,313 --> 00:34:49,250
"Sure. I can wait."

528
00:35:12,468 --> 00:35:14,204
"I want more ideas from the creative team."

529
00:35:14,204 --> 00:35:16,048
"I want you to contact the organizer for me."

530
00:35:21,885 --> 00:35:23,315
"I want to see their portfolio."

531
00:35:23,315 --> 00:35:25,703
"Please answer me!"

532
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:32,010
"Hello?"

533
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:32,988
"Kim."

534
00:35:32,988 --> 00:35:34,204
"?????"

535
00:35:41,795 --> 00:35:45,188
"This lunch, I want medium-rare ribeye steak with caesar salad."

536
00:35:46,731 --> 00:35:48,631
"There's no restaurant that serves steak around here."

537
00:35:48,968 --> 00:35:50,196
"Can't you find one for me?"

538
00:35:51,141 --> 00:35:52,070
"Sure. I'll find one for you."

539
00:36:10,767 --> 00:36:12,623
Okay, I'll stop working.

540
00:36:13,668 --> 00:36:15,108
I'll give you my full attention.

541
00:36:15,868 --> 00:36:16,848
All night?

542
00:36:17,392 --> 00:36:18,106
All night.

543
00:36:18,768 --> 00:36:19,637
I don't believe you.

544
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:20,950
Try me.

545
00:36:49,928 --> 00:36:51,428
Why does he have to bully me like that!?

546
00:36:51,428 --> 00:36:52,830
I'm already doing my best!

547
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,428
I think I've listened to you enough.

548
00:36:54,628 --> 00:36:55,665
Who's bullying you?

549
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:56,928
Mek!

550
00:36:57,528 --> 00:36:58,468
- Mek?
- Mek?

551
00:36:59,928 --> 00:37:01,928
He's now my client.

552
00:37:03,028 --> 00:37:04,928
This world is so small.

553
00:37:05,171 --> 00:37:06,176
Indeed.

554
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:09,315
It's exactly like what happens in those TV series.

555
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:10,771
And what did you do?

556
00:37:11,928 --> 00:37:13,928
Didn't you feel happy at all to meet him again?

557
00:37:13,928 --> 00:37:16,128
And he's bullying you?

558
00:37:17,128 --> 00:37:18,428
How did you respond?

559
00:37:18,628 --> 00:37:19,819
I didn't do anything.

560
00:37:20,728 --> 00:37:23,171
My company sees clients as gods.

561
00:37:23,828 --> 00:37:25,428
So I just pleased him as he wished.

562
00:37:29,828 --> 00:37:31,490
Guys, I have something to talk to you.

563
00:37:32,128 --> 00:37:33,392
It's about Park.

564
00:37:34,828 --> 00:37:36,977
You want us to help you
tone down your sweet couple life?

565
00:37:38,228 --> 00:37:39,173
No.

566
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:42,428
I just think...

567
00:37:47,728 --> 00:37:49,306
Park is probably seeing someone else.

568
00:37:50,228 --> 00:37:52,428
And I'm about to propose to him.

569
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,428
You really are something.

570
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:57,596
But I don't think Park can ever cheat on you.

571
00:37:58,028 --> 00:38:00,396
He seems to be consistent and truly in love with you.

572
00:38:00,828 --> 00:38:02,771
I'm not sure but...

573
00:38:03,228 --> 00:38:05,628
lately, he's been avoiding intimacy.

574
00:38:05,969 --> 00:38:07,206
Also...

575
00:38:07,206 --> 00:38:09,623
He seems to have something going on behind my back.

576
00:38:10,428 --> 00:38:12,058
But nothing has happened.

577
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,720
Don't be anxious about it.

578
00:38:15,528 --> 00:38:16,636
Look at me.

579
00:38:18,128 --> 00:38:19,850
All these fans come to see Bear.

580
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,928
Everyone here in my bar is his fans.

581
00:38:23,328 --> 00:38:25,228
I want him to chase them away
but he won't do it.

582
00:38:25,728 --> 00:38:28,228
I mean, why would he do that?

583
00:38:28,228 --> 00:38:30,874
If one day he falls for his fan,
what am supposed to do?

584
00:38:31,528 --> 00:38:33,528
I'm sure he won't date his own fan.

585
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:36,220
Well, he's dating me.

586
00:38:36,628 --> 00:38:38,428
I used to be in his fan club, too.

587
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,028
You told me not to think too much.

588
00:38:44,128 --> 00:38:46,329
But you're the one with a wild imagination here.

589
00:38:47,182 --> 00:38:48,788
What else am I supposed to do then?

590
00:38:49,228 --> 00:38:50,928
I can't help but feel jealous.

591
00:39:06,128 --> 00:39:07,306
How was it?

592
00:39:10,128 --> 00:39:11,160
Yeah, okay.

593
00:39:11,928 --> 00:39:12,748
Okay.

594
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:16,428
I need to go now.

595
00:39:21,928 --> 00:39:23,428
I'll make a cup of coffee.

596
00:39:26,928 --> 00:39:28,928
"I don't think Park can ever cheat on you."

597
00:39:29,548 --> 00:39:31,725
"He seems to be consistent and truly in love with you."

598
00:39:46,628 --> 00:39:47,649
Lee.

599
00:39:54,628 --> 00:39:56,108
Would you marry me?

600
00:40:02,928 --> 00:40:03,941
No.

601
00:40:07,228 --> 00:40:09,228
You don't want to marry me?

602
00:40:09,228 --> 00:40:11,471
No. No. No.

603
00:40:12,228 --> 00:40:14,747
I mean, it shouldn't happen this way.

604
00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:23,428
Why did you ask me before I do?

605
00:40:24,328 --> 00:40:25,668
My plan is ruined now.

606
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,828
It's all okay, my love.

607
00:40:32,428 --> 00:40:34,233
This is nice.

608
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:38,428
It means we think alike.

609
00:40:38,828 --> 00:40:40,928
But I want to be the one who proposes.

610
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:48,893
I'll take that as a yes then.

611
00:40:50,328 --> 00:40:51,282
Mm.

612
00:40:53,619 --> 00:40:54,729
Yes!

613
00:41:04,828 --> 00:41:08,242
Shouldn't you say anything
before putting the ring on my finger?

614
00:41:12,128 --> 00:41:13,519
I don't want to say anything.

615
00:41:15,828 --> 00:41:17,548
I prefer doing something else.

616
00:42:24,728 --> 00:42:26,728
Bear, come see this!

617
00:42:27,228 --> 00:42:29,228
Park has proposed to Lee!

618
00:42:30,028 --> 00:42:31,038
Here.

619
00:42:32,728 --> 00:42:33,696
Bear.

620
00:42:33,696 --> 00:42:34,550
Yeah?

621
00:42:40,831 --> 00:42:42,084
Yeah.

622
00:42:42,228 --> 00:42:44,228
You're all about work and work and work!

623
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:45,788
Go live with your fans.

624
00:42:45,788 --> 00:42:47,428
Don't waste your time with me.

625
00:42:50,128 --> 00:42:51,928
I'm so sorry!

626
00:42:52,428 --> 00:42:54,063
Don't be mad at me.

627
00:42:55,728 --> 00:42:57,428
I'm not mad.

628
00:42:58,628 --> 00:43:00,428
I told you the truth.

629
00:43:01,592 --> 00:43:02,756
Alright, then...

630
00:43:03,028 --> 00:43:05,028
I'll stop working now.

631
00:43:05,828 --> 00:43:07,587
I'll give my full attention to you.

632
00:43:08,828 --> 00:43:09,928
How does that sound?

633
00:43:20,028 --> 00:43:21,428
All night?

634
00:43:26,428 --> 00:43:27,268
All night.

635
00:43:27,431 --> 00:43:28,647
I don't believe you.

636
00:43:31,482 --> 00:43:32,703
Try me.

637
00:44:27,828 --> 00:44:31,428
After receiving your feedback last time,

638
00:44:31,428 --> 00:44:33,728
our team has taken your comments and got the plan revised.

639
00:44:33,728 --> 00:44:36,328
Since you don't want to reveal your identity,

640
00:44:36,328 --> 00:44:39,169
I decided to propose my ideas to the creatives,

641
00:44:39,169 --> 00:44:42,828
suggesting that we should showcase your works
through a terrarium garden video.

642
00:44:42,828 --> 00:44:46,556
That means only your hands
and your work will be displayed on the video.

643
00:44:47,228 --> 00:44:49,620
Next, let me show you our presentation.

644
00:44:51,665 --> 00:44:52,990
Well...

645
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:56,428
We did some research and found that you have a hobby

646
00:44:56,428 --> 00:44:58,428
of making terrarium gardens.

647
00:44:58,428 --> 00:45:02,188
For me, I think it's a lovely and relatable activity.

648
00:45:02,188 --> 00:45:04,171
And that concludes our presentation today.

649
00:45:04,428 --> 00:45:06,928
From what you presented,
I'm okay with the idea about the video.

650
00:45:07,128 --> 00:45:09,928
But about the script for magazine interviews,

651
00:45:09,928 --> 00:45:11,928
it still looks redundant to me.

652
00:45:11,928 --> 00:45:13,928
Have you considered cutting some parts?

653
00:45:13,928 --> 00:45:16,308
I think I'll keep all of them but shorten the words.

654
00:45:16,308 --> 00:45:18,610
But we need to focus on the main point.

655
00:45:18,610 --> 00:45:20,025
So readers will get our message.

656
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:23,928
I think you can discuss that internally.

657
00:45:23,928 --> 00:45:26,428
From what I've seen, it's thorough enough.

658
00:45:27,128 --> 00:45:28,928
You have done well with your research.

659
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:31,802
Orn, I think...

660
00:45:31,802 --> 00:45:34,307
I do think  some of it can still be improved.

661
00:45:34,428 --> 00:45:36,525
And I want Mek to share his idea with us,

662
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,012
so maybe it's better that we discuss it here.

663
00:45:39,428 --> 00:45:40,998
Well then, in my opinion...

664
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:44,320
I think Kim's research is what makes this project go smoothly.

665
00:45:44,628 --> 00:45:46,428
If it wasn't for him,

666
00:45:46,428 --> 00:45:50,428
all those ideas would still be scattered
and not this well-arranged.

667
00:45:50,728 --> 00:45:52,728
And I disagree about cutting the script.

668
00:45:53,228 --> 00:45:55,228
Because I was the one who told him to put those parts in.

669
00:45:56,328 --> 00:45:57,538
Got it.

670
00:45:58,628 --> 00:46:01,944
In short, I like it and I prefer Kim's approach.

671
00:46:02,628 --> 00:46:03,841
Anyone wants to argue with that?

672
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:05,328
We all agree with you.

673
00:46:05,628 --> 00:46:07,993
If you like it, I like it.

674
00:46:08,628 --> 00:46:09,779
Well done, Kim.

675
00:46:10,315 --> 00:46:11,501
Thank you.

676
00:46:13,928 --> 00:46:18,085
If there's nothing further,
I'd like to end our meeting here.

677
00:46:29,649 --> 00:46:36,239
Mr. Rich, since Kim has done a great job today,

678
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:37,928
we should go celebrate.

679
00:46:38,628 --> 00:46:39,550
Sure.

680
00:46:39,550 --> 00:46:42,628
Let's also make it a welcome party for him.

681
00:46:42,628 --> 00:46:44,428
Mek, would you like to join us?

682
00:46:44,428 --> 00:46:46,428
You know what they say, the more, the merrier!

683
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,708
Sure, if you don't mind.

684
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:51,928
No, not at all!
It's our pleasure to have you with us.

685
00:46:51,928 --> 00:46:53,928
Where should we celebrate then?

686
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,112
I'm so tired of these fancy restaurants.

687
00:46:56,112 --> 00:46:57,357
I have a place to recommend.

688
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,941
It's a casual place to chill out.

689
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:01,830
Sounds great!

690
00:47:06,188 --> 00:47:08,188
Cheers!

691
00:47:09,162 --> 00:47:12,672
Cheers to our Kimhan's success!

692
00:47:13,524 --> 00:47:14,990
Bottoms up!

693
00:47:17,428 --> 00:47:19,990
It's a pity Mr. Rich couldn't come with us.

694
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:22,588
Although our boss is not here with us,

695
00:47:24,028 --> 00:47:27,304
his credit card is!

696
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:31,205
We can go full force. No worries!

697
00:47:32,128 --> 00:47:34,428
Kim, may I ask you one thing?

698
00:47:35,228 --> 00:47:37,623
I heard that...

699
00:47:37,745 --> 00:47:39,355
back in college...

700
00:47:39,477 --> 00:47:42,134
you and Mek were paired up as a BL couple.

701
00:47:42,134 --> 00:47:43,282
Is that true?

702
00:47:47,628 --> 00:47:48,900
- Well...
- Yes.

703
00:47:49,308 --> 00:47:51,068
But it was just for show.

704
00:47:51,628 --> 00:47:53,733
We were never a real couple.

705
00:47:54,228 --> 00:47:55,373
It was just a job.

706
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,671
Nothing special.

707
00:47:58,428 --> 00:48:00,428
Oh, I see.

708
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:02,778
He's right.

709
00:48:02,778 --> 00:48:04,369
There was nothing special about it at all.

710
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:07,698
In fact,

711
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:10,428
he didn't even like me.

712
00:48:10,428 --> 00:48:12,087
We actually hated each other.

713
00:48:12,428 --> 00:48:13,844
Look who's talking.

714
00:48:14,428 --> 00:48:16,428
Old habits die hard. Both of them.

715
00:48:17,869 --> 00:48:19,306
I can't with you two.

716
00:48:22,617 --> 00:48:25,411
Let by gones be bygones.

717
00:48:25,411 --> 00:48:28,525
Don't let the past ruin great vibes here.

718
00:48:30,028 --> 00:48:32,028
Let's drink. Cheers!

719
00:48:32,028 --> 00:48:35,163
Drink up so you guys will be fond of each other after this.

720
00:48:36,453 --> 00:48:40,225
If you can't get along with Kim,
you can get along with me instead.

721
00:48:45,388 --> 00:48:47,002
Cheers!

722
00:48:47,002 --> 00:48:47,997
Bottoms up!

723
00:48:49,308 --> 00:48:50,918
Want another drink?

724
00:48:50,918 --> 00:48:51,667
Yes.

725
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:52,653
Let's go on!

726
00:49:15,028 --> 00:49:16,711
You said you didn't have feelings for me.

727
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:18,418
Why do you still keep it?

728
00:49:34,528 --> 00:49:36,041
Do you still love me?

729
00:50:03,628 --> 00:50:05,628
I never stop loving you.

730
00:50:57,428 --> 00:50:58,392
Kim.

731
00:50:59,828 --> 00:51:01,365
But today's our anniversary.

732
00:51:01,365 --> 00:51:02,708
Why did you agree to the job?

733
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,228
You forgot it, didn't you?

734
00:51:04,228 --> 00:51:05,104
I'm sorry, Bomb.

735
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,623
I just want you to find time for me.

736
00:51:08,328 --> 00:51:10,428
Back then, why did you push me away?

737
00:51:10,928 --> 00:51:12,636
Because I love you.

738
00:51:13,228 --> 00:51:15,388
I didn't want you to hesitate because of me.

739
00:51:15,828 --> 00:51:17,428
Kim, you're the only one...

740
00:51:17,828 --> 00:51:19,748
...that I never hesitate to choose.
