00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Mother saw me and you sleeping together.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.000
If we go back, I don't know what you will get. 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.000
My mother killed a man. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
She needs to hide the secret that I'm a homosexual. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Tian disappeared along with Jiu. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Do you want me to believe that Jiu did these alone?

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.000
Don't tell me that Chan is involved in this.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.000
I definitely won't let her get away. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Mom!

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.000
Yang, it's not what you think.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.000
No need to explain now. Run first.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.000
Why?

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.000
Father is here.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.000
Huh?

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.000
You sent him to hurt my son.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000
But this time, I can't stand it.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.000
because you hurt my child. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Where is my son now? 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.000
I told you already that I didn't know where Tian is. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
If anything happens to Tian, I'll kill you.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.000
Yang. 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.000
Don't say anything. We have a lot to discuss at home.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
What happened? Why are you tied like this?

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.000
Help me and my sister please. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Please take Mei with you. Don't worry about me.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.000
Hurry!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Help me, help. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.000
A culprit caught a child and went over there.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000
She is not feeling well at all.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
I think we need to take her to the doctor urgently.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Okay.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And who is this girl?

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
I don't know either. I saw her being held captive so I helped her out.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
But there was still a boy locked up there.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
If he knows that you helped this child out, you'll get into trouble.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I think so too. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
After the treatment, 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
we need to find a place to hide for this kid.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
But what should we do?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Let her stay with me.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I will take care of her.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Thanks. 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
I must find out who this girl is.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Tell me who helped you. 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.000
I won't. 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Are you going to tell me or not?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
He's gonna die.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
He just fainted. 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.000
Damn it. 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000
So we don't know who helped them. 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Or is it Madam Chan and her son?

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.000
When I sent them off, I let them go through the back exit.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.000
They might see or hear a child cry.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.000
Chan isn't a kind woman who helps abused children.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
What if it's her son?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
His mom is on our side.

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.000
Why would he want to have a problem with us?

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I am afraid that what happened today

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
might be Big Brother who did it

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.000
since he came here all of a sudden.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.000
If Mr. Song really gets Mei, 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000
we don't know what she will tell him.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000
And if they know our move, what should we do?

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Jiu too. 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.000
If he knows his sister was gone, he won't accept this.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000
What are you doing?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
I'm cleaning the floor. 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
You don't have to do. Let me do it.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Hey. 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000
You think I can't do these things.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Even if someone has done this for me, 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.000
but I can do everything.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Sweeping the floor, mopping, doing the laundry, I can do it all. 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Perhaps I can do it very well.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000
What are you laughing at?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
You don't believe what I say?

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
I believe you. 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000
But I don't think you're good enough.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Look, you're all dirty. 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Let's eat. 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000
I think we should buy some dried food. 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000
I don't want you to leave home often.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000
I'm afraid people from my house will see you.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Sure. 

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Let me wash my hands first.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
I think …

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000
It's not that small here.

00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:56.000
We should pick up Mei and Fu to stay here. 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Those two wouldn't be uncomfortable.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
I think they will like it here too.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Tian, if you don't want to go home now, 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
we can stay here for the time being.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
I'll sell candy sugar sculpture again, 

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000
or find something for sale. 

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Once we get some money, we can move to another place.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Go to somewhere no one knows us. 

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Thank you

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
for letting me be part of your life.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
I'm glad to meet you.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
To like you.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
I never thought that, in my life, 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I will meet a good man like you.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I may not be as good as you think, Tian.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
If one day I do something bad to you, 

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000
can you forgive me?

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000
You say this, what do you mean?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000
I'll bring you some water.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
You went to Mr. Ma's today. How was it?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
He seemed scared.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
I think he really didn't know

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
where Tian is. 

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Why do you think like that?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000
A man like Ma, 

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
if he hold the winning hand, 

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000
he wouldn't let us do this.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000
He must have used Tian to threaten us.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000
How is Mr. Tian doing now?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Your subordinate sent out to look for him had no clue at all?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000
How will Madam Li be like?

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.000
Tian has disappeared like this, she must be unsettled.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
About this matter, 

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000
the more I think, the more I find it strange.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
If Tian's disappearance was done by Jiu, 

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Why did Li …

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
let all the workers go to work outside the house?

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000
It's like she allow this to happen. 

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I won't be surprised if it was Chan. 

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Because last time, she seemed to team up with Ma, 

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.000
letting him to blame Li at Dong's funeral. 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Everything seems complicated.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000
So how are you going to handle this?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
I need to know

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
what this is about.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
And who did this?

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Get inside. 

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.000
What are you thinking of doing?

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.000
Why did you bring me to your room?

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.000
Do you want to talk in the hall?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Aren't you afraid others will hear this?

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000
You're misunderstanding me.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:24.000
I just went shopping today.

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.000
It was near Mr. Ma's house, so I just dropped by to greet him.

00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:29.000
Don't you make excuses.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000
Do you know what you've done?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000
If I didn't warn you today, do you know what will happen?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Don't go there again.

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
And tell me the truth.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.000
What did you and Mr. Ma do together in the past?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
About Jiu, 

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000
did you know that from the beginning?

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
And where did he take Tian to?

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.000
Hey, I don't know. I don't know anything.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.000
You're lying. 

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000
If you still don't tell me the truth, 

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
I'm going to tell Father right now.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.000
Wait, Yang. 

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.000
You can't tell Father, otherwise I will surely die.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:12.000
So tell me everything.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000
I just know that

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Mr. Ma would send someone here, 

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.000
but I really don't know who it is.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
I just found out later

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
that it was Jiu. 

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
So how am I supposed to know

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:38.000
where he took Tian to?

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000
I'm telling the truth.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Jiu is Mr. Ma's subordinate.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
So all this time, 

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Since he met Tian first time, saving his life, asking for job,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
these are made to deceive Tian.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Tian shouldn't trust a guy like him.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
I don't know where he takes Mr. Tian to?

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.000
And he already knows his secret.

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:20.000
If he tells Mr. Ma, 

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:25.000
the position of the family leader and the association head must be revoked. 

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
What should we do?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
First of all, we need to find Tian quickly. 

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.000
Then blame Ma and Chan to all the troubles. 

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000
And finally, 

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000
We have to Kill Jiu to let Tian's secret die with him. 

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.000
These beetles have already gained power from orchid dust, Madam.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Soon we will get beetle orchid to get rid of Jiu.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
How is the girl, doctor?

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000
We need to talk. 

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000
What? The girl is addicted to opium?

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Yes, the doctor said so. Her condition is severe.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000
How is it possible? She's still young.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000
It must be Mr. Ma. 

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000
This means this child must have something that Mr. Ma wants.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
If she is treated, we’ll probably know about it.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
So have you found Tian?

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
My father sent people to look for him, but still can't him yet.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000
And now I don't know where Jiu did him. 

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.000
The workers searched at Jiu's old house and didn't find them. 

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
The longer it passes, the more dangerous it becomes.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Auntie, two packs of noodles.

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.000
Okay. 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Have you seen these two men in this picture?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000
No?

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Excuse me, have you seen these two men?

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
No, I'm not familiar with them. 

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Hey, have you seen these two?

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:22.000
No.

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:23.000
No?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Right, not at all. 

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Hurry up, I'm in a hurry.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Are you done yet?

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.000
Here you are. 

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Excuse me, have you seen these two?

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Oh, he's over there.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Jiu! Freeze!

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Where did you hide Tian?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Tell Mr. Song that Mr. Tian is fine.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.000
Zhao, get him.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Don't come in, or I'll kill Bao.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Jiu. 

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000
What happened to you?

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Who did this?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Your father.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Your father let people come after me.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Now they've been looking for us around. 

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000
It hurts a bit.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
My father sent people out looking for us like this, 

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000
we are in trouble.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
I think I'd better go home.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Tian. 

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Is it hard to be with me?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000
I'm sorry that I can't take good care of you.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000
But I understand that you've never had a hard time like this before.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.000
You're so tired, aren't you?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.000
But can you not leave me?

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000
I promise I'll try to take better care of you.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000
I'll do better, Tian.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Don't leave me.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000
It's not like that at all.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:22.000
I want to go home…

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
because I'm worried about you.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
I am afraid that you will be in danger. 

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Today my father sent someone to hurt you.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
I'm afraid that, in the future, 

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
he might send someone to kill you instead. 

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Don't be afraid about that. 

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000
I can take care of myself.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.000
You've found Jiu? What about Tian?

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:18.800
No. 

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
But he let me tell you that Mr. Tian is okay. 

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
I ask at the noodle shop, she said

00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:26.000
he bought two packs.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Then Tian is probably still safe.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
And Jiu bought food for him.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
What is he doing?

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.000
Kidnapping Tian, but didn't bring him to Ma.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Why is he keeping Tian to himself?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
He might be planning, Sir. 

00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.000
So he keeps Tian for negotiation.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.000
Did they find Jiu?

00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.000
If he took Tian, 

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.000
why didn't he bring him to Mr. Ma?

00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:05.000
Madam Li suspects that he may keep Mr. Tian for negotiation.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
I think he wants money.

00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000
If he wants money, 

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:17.000
then why didn't he contact Mr. Song to demand money?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Or why didn't he go to Mr. Ma to ask for more money?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Why did they run away and hide like this?

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Right.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000
What is this?

00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:36.000
If they are woman and man, I think that they have eloped. 

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000
You spoke nonsense.

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Now, keep an eye on Madam Li. 

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.000
If she makes a move, tell me immediately.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.000
Sir. 

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:05.000
I think Chan must be involved in this capture for sure.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000
If you forced her to speak, she might tell us.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.000
We still don't have evidence that she was involved.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
But if we get the Jiu, 

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:20.000
we'll be able to reach everyone involved.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Evidence?

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
In fact, the day before, I met someone at the shrine.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
He saw Chan talking to Mr. Ma and Jiu.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Do you want me to call him here?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Are you sure?

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:40.000
Then take him here. 

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.000
I'll ask him myself. 

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
But if I ask him, 

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
and know that he lies or makes up a story, 

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
I definitely won't let this go. 

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.000
If you're afraid that he is unreliable, 

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
I think we can wait to meet Jiu first.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
Come in. 

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Li, you go out first. 

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Doctor Qi sent a letter to you.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Sir. 

00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:44.000
I've finished what I did here.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000
I've successfully created resurrection dust, 

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:56.000
the antidote against the beetle orchid.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.000
If someone has been poisoned by the insect, 

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:20.000
we can definitely use this as the antidote. 

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.000
In addition, when I use the antidote, 

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:31.000
I also discovered that if we touch the beetle orchid, 

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:34.000
and then touch resurrection dust, 

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000
strange golden blotches will appear on the hand.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
After one night, the blotches disappear.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.000
If I go back, 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000
I can definitely prove whether Madam Li and Jia

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:04.000
used that beetle orchid to kill someone.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:08.000
I will take the boat back to tomorrow evening.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Don't worry about me. 

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Doctor Qi sent a letter to you, Sir. 

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000
If I go back, 

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000
I can definitely prove whether Madam Li and Jia used that beetle orchid to kill someone.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
I will take the boat back to tomorrow evening.

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:29.000
Don't worry about me. 

00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:24.000
I finished making the beetle orchid, Madam.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000
If you meet Jiu, you can kill him with this. 

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Where is beetle orchid?

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Nuan. 

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Jia, what are you doing? Let me go.

00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.000
Did you mess with my stuff? 

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
What stuff? I don't know.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Why did you snoop around the storage room?

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000
I don't know.

00:31:35.300 --> 00:31:36.000
You don't know?

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:38.000
I didn't take a thing. What?

00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.000
Where did you hide it? Give me my stuff.

00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:41.000
I said I don't have it. 

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.000
Where did you hide it? / Stop. 

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.000
Jia. 

00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.000
Stop!

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.000
Jia. 

00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.000
What are you doing to my servant?

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.000
Madam, help me.

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:51.000
Nuan stole my stuff.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
I didn't steal it. I really doesn't know.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Jia, what stuff is missing? 

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000
Right. You can't do this to my servant. 

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Nuan is suspicious.

00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.000
She snooped on me.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.000
At first, I intended to follow you, but I lost you finally, 

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:13.000
so I came back home. But I didn't steal anything.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Nuan. 

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Why would you follow her?

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000
She lives here, 

00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:31.000
she has to monitor if someone does something evil.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:34.000
Jia. 

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
What is missing?

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.000
I'll tell Mr. Song.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
If Nuan didn't take it, 

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000
we will help you find it. 

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:46.000
Right. 

00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:48.000
What's missing? Speak. 

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Don't blame someone without evidence like this. 

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
I may have remembered the place I put it wrongly. 

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
If she said she didn't take it, then she didn't.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Give it to me. What did you steal?

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:28.000
Well, I told you that I didn't steal anything.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:33.000
I was just shocked. I thought Jia caught me following her.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
But I really didn't steal anything.

00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:38.000
Bitch, I thought you were lying.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Then what's that stuff?

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:46.000
Why is she angry this much?

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.000
I arrived in Phra Nakhon.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
You two finished your duty. You can now go back to your wife and children. 

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
I will go back to Mr. Song's home myself.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:32.000
We have things to discuss. 

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:50.000
What business do you have that makes you wait for me, Madam? 

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Didn't Jia come with you?

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000
I have an important matter to discuss with you. 

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Jia can't know this. 

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Are you going to kill me?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Doctor. 

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
We never had bad blood between us. 

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Let me and my son go, please.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
I beg you. Don't go back to my house again. 

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
So it means that you and Jia really used the beetle orchid to kill someone?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.000
I don't want to do it

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
But the man Jia and I killed

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
is an evil.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:39.000
He deserved to die.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
He never did good things. He only did bad things. 

00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.000
Whether he was good or not, you have no right to take his life.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Why did you kill people?

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.000
Is it because of Mr. Tian's secret?

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:57.000
I need to protect my son. 

00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000
I didn't want to hurt anyone.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Then why didn't you discuss with Mr. Song?

00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:07.000
He is Mr. Tian's father. Why can't he know it?

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Even you, after you know his secret, you still protect him.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:14.000
No way, if Mr. Song knows, 

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Tian will be pressured to the point of killing himself.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Like…

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Zhang! Zhang! Zhang!

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:45.000
Please, Doctor.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Don't go back to the house again.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
I promise that if this is over, I will be ordained to pay for karma.

00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:57.000
Or if it's still not enough, I will commit suicide to pay for my crime.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Whether you are ordained or kill yourself, 

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
it can't replace the lives of those who have died because of you and Jia. 

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
I have to apologize, Madam. 

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
I can't do as you asked. 

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
You are right.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
I have no right to take anyone's life.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
But if the mother

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
refuses to go to hell for her child, 

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
then who will do?

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Madam, we got issue. 

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
The beetle orchid has disappeared. 

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
You took it. I thought it was lost. 

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
What did you do with it?

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Jia. 

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I'm sorry.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
What's wrong, Madam?

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000
I heard that Doctor Qi would return today.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
So I...

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
This is not true.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.000
It's not true, right?

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000
It's not true. 

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
I'm sorry.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000
But I can't let him go. 

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000
He said in the letter

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
that he could prove that we actually killed someone.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
So I have to kill him. 

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000
It's not true. 

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
It's not true, right?

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000
I'm grateful to Doctor Qi.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000
I'm sorry.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Doctor.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.000
It's not true. Not true. 

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:46.000
I can't. 

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Jia, Jia. 

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Jia, I must do it. 

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
I knew that you would stop me, 

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
so I did it myself.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000
You can be angry or hate he.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
But I need to do it. 

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
I wasn't angry you.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
I hate the faith.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
I hate the heaven.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Why can't a good man like Mr. Tian be normal like others?

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
If he wasn't like this, 

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.000
I wouldn't have to kill anyone.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Jia, Jia. 

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Jia, Jia. 

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Jia. 

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Jia. 

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Jia. 

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Doctor.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:32.000
I was wrong.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
I'm a bitch. 

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000
I will not ask you to forgive me.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
I deserve it. 

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000
I deserved to be hated by you.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
If Mr. Tian successfully succeeded, 

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000
I will use this knife

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
to slit my own throat

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
to take the punishment from you in the next world.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Until now, why hasn't Doctor Qi come yet?

00:45:47.600 --> 00:45:49.000
Right, this is unusual.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Bao, let people find him.

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000
And got his bodyguards' house as well to see if they are home.

00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.000
Why didn't we hear any news?

00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:00.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:05.000
You need some rest.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
If you fall ill, it will be worse.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Death is not scary.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Living in this world is scary.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
I have lived to this age, 

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000
thinking of retiring. 

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000
When it's time to rest, 

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
I face something that is hard for me instead. 

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Harder than I work through all my life.

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Leave it to me. I'll find Doctor Qi.

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Don't worry. 

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Tian is nowhere to be seen. 

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
I don't know how is he now. 

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Bao.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000
There is one more thing that I want you to do. 

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
Li. 

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Why are you praying to the Buddha in the middle of the night like this?

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Why can't I do it?

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
I don't usually see you doing this.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
Where have you been this evening?

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.000
I pray to the Buddha, I went outside. It's always suspicious.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
I'm not good in your eyes. 

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:10.000
Why?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
My child is missing. I pray to the Buddha to ask him to protect our son. 

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.000
How can I act normal when nothing is normal now?

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:36.000
I'm sorry.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000
You're right. 

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Nothing is normal.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:55.000
I don't know how we end up like this. 

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Someone died.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Our child is gone.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Both of us used to discuss everything

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.000
about work, 

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
our kid, 

00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000
servants.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000
But now…

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
We don't seem to know each other anymore.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000
I don't know what to do. 

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:49.000
I want my child back.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:56.000
I want your old self back. 

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Dad, Mom. 

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Today I bring my lover to pay respects to you. 

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000
Tian is a member of our family now.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Now I don't have to be alone.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:09.000
He is taking care of me.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Don't worry anymore. 

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Dad.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Mom.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000
I'll be with Jiu.

00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:25.000
I'm going to pick up Jiu and Fu to stay with us. 

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
I promise that I will take good care of everyone in the family.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000
May your souls 

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
protect us too.

00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Tian might not be like the one you had imagined.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.000
But he's better than you thought.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
I love him so much.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.000
I believe that if you were still alive, 

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.000
you would love him as much as I do. 

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Let's go get something to eat.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:06.000
Don't worry. 

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000
People don't know what we are.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
They probably only think that we're male friends holding hands.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:17.000
But I'm scared. We're not like everyone else.

00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:18.000
Tian. 

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
But I have a dream.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
That one day we all can love

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000
without having to gender discrimination.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000
No one disgusts us, or sees us as abnormal.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000
No homosexual thing.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Only love.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000
When that day comes, 

00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000
we are all equal.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
So you wait for me here.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
I'll go buy some food and I'll be right back.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Hurry up.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:23.000
The doctor just checked the girl again this morning.

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.000
She is conscious, but still can't speak.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:30.000
The doctor told her to get plenty of rest so that she can recover quickly.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Pin. 

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Thanks. Please take care of it for me. 

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
I'm willing to help this girl. 

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:44.000
My father and Nangnoi also help me at home. 

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Jiu. 

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Yang.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Yang. I'm sorry.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Yang, Yang.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Where do you hide Tian?

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Yang, listen to me first.

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:15.000
Jiu. 

00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.000
Please calm down.

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.000
I know you're Mr. Ma's subordinate. 

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Yang, listen to me.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Jiu. 

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
I will never hurt Tian. I love him. 

00:56:34.200 --> 00:56:37.000
Liar. You deceive him, right?

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
You're going to tell Ma about him. 

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Jiu. 

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Yang

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Here.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Pin. 

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Tian. 

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Tian. 

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Where have you been?

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Everyone at home is very worried about you. 

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
So did Jiu hurt you?

00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.000
No, he didn't do anything.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Do you have a pencil or a pen with you now?

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Yes. 

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Here. 

00:57:57.300 --> 00:58:00.000
Give Yang this letter and let him take it to Bua.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Why do you have to leave a letter?

00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:04.000
Why didn't you go home?

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
I can't go back now. 

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:08.000
I'll tell you later. It's a long story.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
But don't worry about me. 

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Jiu is a good man. He won't harm me. 

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000
Tian. 

00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:23.000
Jiu is deceiving you.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Jiu is a subordinate of …

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.000
Tian. 

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Tian, Jiu is…

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Tian, your brother is following me. Let's go.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Pin, please give it to Yang.

00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.000
Let's go.

00:58:33.400 --> 00:58:35.000
Tian, listen to me first. 

00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:36.000
Tian. 

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000
Tian. 

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:38.900
Tian. 

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Yang.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Yang.

00:58:47.200 --> 00:58:48.000
Sorry, Madam. / Tian!

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Pin. 

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Don't get up yet.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Where is Jew taking Tian to?

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Yang.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Tian gave me a letter.

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Bua,

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
please meet me at the shrine next to the market tomorrow night.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Don't let anyone know.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Jiu really captures Tian.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
That's why he has to send a letter asking for help.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Perhaps it's not like that.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Tian was talking to me for quite a long time.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000
If he wanted to run away or go home, he could do it.

00:59:47.500 --> 00:59:50.000
But he chooses to go with Jiu.

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:54.000
I think…

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Tian and Jiu, 

00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:02.000
the two of them may have an unexpected relationship.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.000
You know about this?

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Yes. 

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
I can tell. 

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:16.000
I just realize now when you said

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Tian would never be able to love me. 

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
Pin. 

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
I beg you, don't tell this to anyone.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
I don't want Tian to suffer. Please, I beg of you.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.000
Okay. 

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000
All these years, 

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Tian has lived a hard life.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.000
He has to hide what he is. 

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I tried to ask him. I wanted to help and solve his problem, 

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
but he never told me.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Until one day I learned the truth, 

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:02.000
I got it now

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:05.000
why he can't tell anyone.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000
You aren't angry or disgusted that he was like this, right?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Not at all.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000
No matter what he is, 

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Tian is the brother that I love the most.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.000
But it doesn't mean that people in this world will understand him like I do. 

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000
There are still people who are taking advantage of this.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
If this secret is revealed, 

01:01:34.700 --> 01:01:39.000
Mr. Ma will use this as an excuse to inherit the title of the Five Dragons Association's head. 

01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:41.000
That's why he sent Jiu to deceive Tian. 

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.000
But…

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:52.000
I think Jiu might not deceive Tian. He may really love him.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.000
That's not true. Not true.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
I don't believe it. There's no way he really loves my brother.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000
He is the subordinate of Mr. Ma. 

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:07.000
I will find a way to help Tian no matter what.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
What bothers you?

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Many things.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
My father sent people to find us.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:49.000
You met Yang and got into a fight.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Don't worry about that. 

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.000
I didn't hurt your brother.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
I know.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Thank you anyway.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
Jiu. 

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
I don't think we can stay like this any longer.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000
One day my father's people will find us.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Tian. 

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000
I will take better care of myself from now on.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
I won't go to a crowded place.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Don't leave me, Tian.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
You know how important you are to me.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:39.000
In the past, I might live day by day without knowing my future.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
But after I found you, 

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
I want to be a better person

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
and do everything to make you and I very happy.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Jiu, calm down.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
I'm not leaving you.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000
I already got a plan. 

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
If I talk to Bua tomorrow, 

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.000
everything will probably end.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Then we…

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
we will be together.

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000
No one will look for us.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Bua, please meet me at the shrine next to the market tomorrow night.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Don't let anyone know.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Mr. Tian's letter.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
So how are you going to do?

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Why are they talking here?

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:08.000
And what's that paper?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Bua and Yang discussed something?

01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.000
Yes, Madam. 

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
They looked suspicious.

01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.000
Should we call Bua to ask?

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
Tian. 

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
You really won't let me go with you?

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
I want to talk to Bua alone.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
One more thing, 

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.000
my father might send someone to follow me. 

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:47.000
And if they find you, they must hurt you for sure. 

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.000
But Tian...

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.000
Don't worry.

01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Today everything will end.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
I'll do anything for the two of us to be together.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I promise you. 

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Then let me walk you there. 

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Let's go. 

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Tell our people

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
to destroy that bitch Xiaotong's teahouse.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
So she'll know that

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000
if she messes with my matter, what will she face?

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:33.000
So she won't dare to tell Big Brother about me later.

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Sir. 

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Jiu. 

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
We got the news about Jiu's hiding place, Sir.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:38.000
How is it?

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:40.000
A fisherman found Mr. Tian and Jiu.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
He thought that their faces were familiar, just like in our notice.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
So he followed them. It turned out to be them. 

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Now we know where the two of them are.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Take me there right now.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Tian, are you back?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Mr. Ma. 

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Bua, 

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000
Yang didn’t come with you?

01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Bua, I can't stay long. I have to hurry.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
I want to say that I left the house

01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:09.000
not because someone caught or hurt me.

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:10.000
I am willing to leave the house by myself.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Bua, 

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I don't want to go home anymore. 

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000
I don't want to return to the position of the clan leader. 

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:21.000
I know I'm not worthy.

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.000
I'm not like everyone else.

01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I… I am someone that no one will accept.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000
I love men, Bua. 

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
I love Jiu. 

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
We are going to live somewhere else. Please help me, Bua.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Please go back and tell Father

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
to stop looking for me. Just let us go.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Please, Bua. 

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
So it's like this.

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Mother.

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Please let me go to be with the person I love.

01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:06.000
I beg you.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
The hut is over there, Sir. 

01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.000
The relationship between these two is strange.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.000
You know about it, right?

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:22.000
We have to finish this first before he shares Tian's secret.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:24.000
What shall we do?

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
You couldn't tell me Tian's secret.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
I will kill him myself.
