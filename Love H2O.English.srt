is living here without her.

Are you sure?

What are you doing?

01:00:55,458 --> 01:00:57,250
I'm just stretching.

How do you write "water"?

851
01:01:37,875 --> 01:01:38,833
Water?

852
01:01:38,916 --> 01:01:39,958
Yes, "water."

Okay.

Okay, okay. I'm taking it seriously now.

No, no, it can't be.

Or when I went to the toilet?

Yes, it must be there.

Never mind. If you really want it,
I'll buy you another one.

929
01:06:28,750 --> 01:06:30,416
About everything you left.

It's so selfish.

Fine, you are an angel.

932
01:06:34,916 --> 01:06:36,250
You've never done
anything for yourself?

Wait, let me have a look.

946
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:04,250
Instead of whining,
why don't you ride it yourself?

947
01:07:04,333 --> 01:07:06,125
-Will you go faster?
-Nagging all the time.

948
01:07:06,208 --> 01:07:08,083
[Nam] Will you stop complaining?

949

-I'm going across.
-Let me help.

951

Just go ahead.

952
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:26,000
Shit.

953
01:07:47,291 --> 01:07:49,333
What the hell? [sniffs, coughs]

-I have the noodles.
-[Ohm] I don't understand.

956
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,333
Will you come help me?

957
01:08:01,416 --> 01:08:02,916
Come here.

958
01:08:03,000 --> 01:08:07,166
Went to get the noodles.

959

-Noodle, noodle.
-Let me find the dictionary.

961
01:08:11,416 --> 01:08:13,625
You have a dictionary? Give it to me.

962
01:08:13,708 --> 01:08:17,083
-I didn't bring it.
-Damn it!

964
01:08:22,916 --> 01:08:24,541
Run!

965
01:08:31,625 --> 01:08:34,083
[Chef] When I got the call, I was shocked.

966
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:36,708
[Ohm] Actually, I appreciate your help.

967
01:08:36,791 --> 01:08:39,375
But I think I can handle it.

968
01:08:39,458 --> 01:08:40,500
Is that right?

969
01:08:41,291 --> 01:08:42,416
Let me go thank her.

970
01:08:45,166 --> 01:08:49,916
When you were scolded
by the Chinese guard,

971
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:51,000
it was funny.

972
01:08:51,541 --> 01:08:52,791
-Funny?
-Yes.

973
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:54,291
-Funny?
-Yes.

974
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:58,666
You should be locked up.

975
01:08:58,750 --> 01:09:01,541
If I'm in jail, who will take care of me?

976
01:09:02,291 --> 01:09:04,625
That's easy. You just...

977
01:09:05,041 --> 01:09:06,166
die in jail.

978
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:08,666
Tough, huh?

979
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,916
When he scolded you,
you didn't look different.

980
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:16,750
I was going to ask.

981
01:09:16,833 --> 01:09:22,458
The August 13-14 thing,
what do you want me to do?

982
01:09:22,541 --> 01:09:24,375
What?

983
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:27,875
I can remember.

984
01:09:29,166 --> 01:09:31,625
August 13, yes.

985
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:33,666
What is on August 13?

986
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:36,666
-I didn't invite you--
-Wait.

987
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:38,875
Don't pretend that you don't remember.

988
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:40,750
Let's check it out.

989
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:45,583
Let's see who texted me.

990
01:09:47,958 --> 01:09:49,416
You sent me the message.

991
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,541
I was not being serious.

992
01:09:52,625 --> 01:09:53,791
You don't need to go.

993
01:09:54,458 --> 01:09:56,375
I don't care. I will go.

994
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:01,041
You don't have to.

995
01:10:01,958 --> 01:10:03,416
I have nothing for you.

996
01:10:03,958 --> 01:10:04,916
Nam.

997
01:10:08,250 --> 01:10:10,791
This time, I might not want
anything from you.

[sentimental music]

999
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:32,625

01:10:34,666 --> 01:10:35,875
