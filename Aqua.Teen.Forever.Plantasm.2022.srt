1
00:00:30,946 --> 00:00:32,946
Oh, my stomach hurts.

2
00:00:32,948 --> 00:00:35,249
I feel like
I got gas or something.

3
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,883
No! No!

4
00:00:36,885 --> 00:00:38,352
This ain't gas!

5
00:00:38,354 --> 00:00:40,488
W-W-What's happening to me?!

6
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:43,690
Who wants to party?!

7
00:00:43,692 --> 00:00:45,493
Carl looks like
he needs a hug.

8
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:46,759
Meatwad,
that's not Carl.

9
00:00:46,761 --> 00:00:48,329
It's John Carpenter's
"The Thingamajig."

10
00:00:48,331 --> 00:00:51,534
And if you hug it, it will hug
you back until you are dead.

11
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:55,001
<i>Commence self-destruct</i>
<i>mode in T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

12
00:00:55,003 --> 00:00:57,138
Get in your suits! Hurry!
But, Shake,

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:01:00,006
what about you?
Just get your ass
in that Escape Cup.

14
00:01:00,008 --> 00:01:02,176
I'm never gonna get laid again!

15
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:04,944
I don't need no instructions
to know how to ride!

16
00:01:04,946 --> 00:01:06,247
Look at my freaking body!

17
00:01:06,249 --> 00:01:08,915
I brought enough
lasers for everybody.

18
00:01:08,917 --> 00:01:10,417
Oh, that don't matter.

19
00:01:10,419 --> 00:01:11,684
None of this matters.

20
00:01:11,686 --> 00:01:13,855
Yeah! Aah!

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,758
Come here!

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:20,294
Ahh! Damn it!
He's got me.

23
00:01:20,296 --> 00:01:23,997
Lay off the French fries,
Fat Stuff!

24
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,133
What, ya --
What, ya steppin' to me?

25
00:01:26,135 --> 00:01:28,171
I know you wasn't
talking to me.

26
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:36,311
Let's do this!
Yeah!

27
00:01:36,313 --> 00:01:39,314
Maybe you need to lose
some weight, Carl...

28
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:41,050
in the head region.

29
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,156
Where did Carl go?

30
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,057
And all his --
Were those his cousins?

31
00:01:50,059 --> 00:01:52,726
Carl was never
an official Aqua Teen,

32
00:01:52,728 --> 00:01:54,728
just a try-hard wannabe.

33
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:58,368
But us, we're O.G.
Aqua Teen Forever.

34
00:01:59,269 --> 00:02:01,936
Shake's right, Meatwad.
We stick together always.

35
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:03,171
Buckle up, gang.
<i>T-minus 20 seconds.</i>

36
00:02:03,173 --> 00:02:05,407
But there's only room
for two in here.

37
00:02:05,409 --> 00:02:06,907
<i>20...19...</i>

38
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:08,809
This was always a one-way trip
for me.
<i>...18, 17...</i>

39
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:10,711
Shake, no!
We can fit you in the cupholder.
<i>...16, 15...</i>

40
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,148
I thought we was
gonna be together.
<i>...14, 13...</i>

41
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,916
Aqua Teen Forever.

42
00:02:15,918 --> 00:02:17,485
Nothing lasts forever.
<i>...12, 11...</i>

43
00:02:17,487 --> 00:02:19,254
Initiate the launch.

44
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:21,289
Sayonara, guys.
Say hi to Earth for me.
<i>...10, 9, 8...</i>

45
00:02:21,291 --> 00:02:23,325
We'll never forget you, Shake.
<i>...7...</i>

46
00:02:23,327 --> 00:02:25,360
And when you get down there,
tell my wife I love her.
<i>...6, 5...</i>

47
00:02:25,362 --> 00:02:27,761
Okay, man. We gotta go.
Push the launch button, please.
<i>...4, 3...</i>

48
00:02:27,763 --> 00:02:29,997
And I want you to give
that big blue marble...
<i>...2...</i>

49
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:31,399
...a little kiss for me.
<i>...1...</i>

50
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,935
Push the damn button or --

51
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:38,473
And now I'm homeless.

52
00:02:38,475 --> 00:02:41,376
Can you believe how this country
treats our space heroes?

53
00:02:41,378 --> 00:02:44,878
So you survived
when the ship self-destructed?

54
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,181
I'm standing here,
aren't I?

55
00:02:46,183 --> 00:02:48,849
What part of time travel
do you not understand?

56
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:50,951
Where's the rest of
your Aqua Teens?

57
00:02:50,953 --> 00:02:52,287
I said they're dead,

58
00:02:52,289 --> 00:02:55,022
even though I did fight
valiantly to save them.

59
00:02:55,024 --> 00:02:56,391
That's how heroic I am.

60
00:02:56,393 --> 00:02:58,727
Saving dicks who don't even
appreciate me.

61
00:02:58,729 --> 00:03:00,495
They exist only
on this tattoo,

62
00:03:00,497 --> 00:03:03,931
which I'm getting changed
to say "Aqua Teen Never"

63
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,501
because that's cheaper
than getting it removed.

64
00:03:06,503 --> 00:03:08,169
Why Aqua Teen?

65
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:09,638
You seem
way older than a teenage --

66
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,139
I'm well into
my late 40s.

67
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:12,806
What is this?
A press conference?

68
00:03:12,808 --> 00:03:15,243

Oh, no!

00:04:21,043 --> 00:04:23,111
You're three minutes in,
and the Mooninites

98
00:04:23,113 --> 00:04:25,247
have already
hijacked your movie.

99
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:27,383
And if you ever want to see
your movie alive again, bitch,

100
00:04:27,385 --> 00:04:32,053
you will text ERRIZDAMAN
to ERRULZ (377859).

101
00:04:32,055 --> 00:04:35,157
Errulz?
What gibberish is this?

102
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:37,159
It's my agenda.
It's not even
spelled right.

103
00:04:37,161 --> 00:04:39,228
Err does rule.
You didn't think to ask me

104
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:42,465
before you made "ERRULZ"
our ransom text line?

105
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,467
Man, I must have been so drunk
when I did it.

106
00:04:44,469 --> 00:04:49,338
Text "ERRIZDAMAN" -- one word --
and then check your phone.

107
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,841
Whoops!
And now we've
hijacked your phone.

108
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:53,175
Ha ha ha!
That's right.

109
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:55,076
We dominate
both your screens.

110
00:04:55,078 --> 00:04:56,512
We are everywhere
at once!

111
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:59,648
The Mooninites control
all your wireless devices,

112
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,118
including
your remote control...
Don't touch it.

113
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:04,854
...which we control
remotely...
I said, don't touch it!

114
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:06,455
...with a separate
remote control.

115
00:05:06,457 --> 00:05:09,861
We're digital.
And we have
one more digit for you.

116
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,728
Drop to your knees
and feast upon it.

117
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,134
'Cause this is your food.
Let it nourish you.

118
00:05:17,535 --> 00:05:20,436
What else can we say
to offend, Err?

119
00:05:20,438 --> 00:05:22,471
I don't know, man.
Kind of running out of stuff.

120
00:05:22,473 --> 00:05:25,307
We're going to come up
with some other wicked barbs

121
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:27,443
to berate you with,
but until then,

122
00:05:27,445 --> 00:05:30,813
choke on your pathetic excuse
for entertainment.

123
00:05:30,815 --> 00:05:33,081
You just wasted $3.

124
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,818
No, it's $19.99.
What? For this?

125
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,019
Robbery!
No, this is nothing

126
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,722
but a pathetic cash grab.

127
00:05:39,724 --> 00:05:41,325
Theaters rejected it.

128
00:05:42,627 --> 00:05:45,294
Yah! Whoo! Yah!

129
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:48,664
Whoa, Billy! Whoa, Jenny!
Whoa, Bobby!

130
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:49,998
Turn right, Lucy.

131
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,067
Turn right, Billy.
Turn right, Other Bobby.

132
00:05:54,739 --> 00:05:57,306
Okay, don't everybody
love on me at once.

133
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:59,708
Meatwad, we don't need
any more dogs.

134
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,010
Ouch, Billy. Ouch, Bobby.

135
00:06:02,012 --> 00:06:03,846
Ouch, Other Bobby.
Now, that hurts.

136
00:06:03,848 --> 00:06:05,079
We're running
out of space.

137
00:06:05,081 --> 00:06:06,948
And judging by
some of these tags,

138
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,351
did you steal these dogs
from dog owners?

139
00:06:09,353 --> 00:06:10,686
I just love me some dogs.

140
00:06:10,688 --> 00:06:13,088
My emotions run very high
when I see them.

141
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,324
And, well, it often
clouds my judgment.

142
00:06:15,326 --> 00:06:18,127
Yeah, they love you, too,
but in a different way.

143
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:19,361
Ow!
Down, boy!

144
00:06:19,363 --> 00:06:20,729
I'm getting in
good shape working here.

145
00:06:20,731 --> 00:06:22,865
I lost 20 pounds just last week.

146
00:06:22,867 --> 00:06:24,133
Ouch!
Down!

147
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:26,735
Liz, you should go home
and take a load off.

148
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:28,069
Give them dogs a rest.

149
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,438
I'm talking about
your feetsies, now.

150
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,941
You lock up every night,
Meatwad.

151
00:06:31,943 --> 00:06:36,145
I feel bad asking this, but
you're not living here, are you?

152
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:39,181
No! Lord, no.
Oh, good.

153
00:06:39,183 --> 00:06:41,917
This is an animal shelter,
Liz.

154
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,153
I'm a man.
Come on, now.

155
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:45,454
Here are the keys.

156
00:06:45,456 --> 00:06:47,723
Oh! I feel so guilty
making you lock up again.

157
00:06:47,725 --> 00:06:51,827
Guilty enough that, uh, maybe I
crash with you for a few weeks

158
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:53,696
at your apartment,
with the food and all?

159
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:55,029
No, no.

160
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:56,499
Not that kind of guilt.

161
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,567
The kind of guilt where you
say it but you don't mean it

162
00:06:58,569 --> 00:06:59,768
or feel it.

163
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,035
Why do you ask?

164
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:02,605
No reason whatsoever.

165
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:04,673
I got me a big house
to live in.

166
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,142
Two cool roommates, too.
You've seen my tattoo.

167
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,912
Aqua Teen Forever, baby.

168
00:07:09,914 --> 00:07:11,180
Frylock, Master Shake.

169
00:07:11,182 --> 00:07:14,015
These here are my homeboys.

170
00:07:14,017 --> 00:07:16,218
Listen to me prattle on.

171
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,522
See ya later.

172
00:07:39,076 --> 00:07:41,678
We got goblins?
Huge ones.
You haven't heard them?

173
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,880
Shake, ain't no goddamn goblins
in here, man.

174
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:45,715
And now you curse
in front of him.

175
00:07:45,717 --> 00:07:48,785
Is it any wonder why Meatwad's
so up?

176
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:51,123
You ass asshole.

177
00:07:52,157 --> 00:07:55,392
Ugh.

178
00:07:55,394 --> 00:07:58,028
"Dongle."

179
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,297
Where's my computer?
I sold it.

180
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:01,731
Had to buy
the Halloween costumes.

181
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:03,433
Boo. I'm Macaroni Man.

182
00:08:03,435 --> 00:08:05,201
Okay, his is not
the good one.

183
00:08:05,203 --> 00:08:07,971
I had the cure for cancer
on that hard drive, Shake.

184
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:11,975
But when I win, we use the money
to buy your computer back.

185
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:14,311
'Course, I got to split the
winnings with these other guys.

186
00:08:14,313 --> 00:08:16,546
Yeah.
Nice!

187
00:08:16,548 --> 00:08:18,915
Big man.

188
00:08:21,053 --> 00:08:23,553
Unh-unh, unh-unh.

189
00:08:23,555 --> 00:08:24,721
Meatwad, let go.

190
00:08:24,723 --> 00:08:27,724
But who's gonna feed me
and help me say my prayers

191
00:08:27,726 --> 00:08:28,725
and tuck me in at night?

192
00:08:28,727 --> 00:08:30,527
You got to let go
of me, please.

193
00:08:30,529 --> 00:08:32,596
Frylock, you're not leaving.

194
00:08:32,598 --> 00:08:34,998
I'm the leader
and I'm telling you,

195
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,199
you're not going anywhere.

196
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:37,801
Yeah, walk it off.

197
00:08:37,803 --> 00:08:40,136
You'll be back...
by -- by the end of the month

198
00:08:40,138 --> 00:08:41,771
to pay the bills, right?

199
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:46,409
Or I'll get evicted, and --
and that is not happening, son!

200
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:48,445
You think
he heard any of that?

201
00:08:48,447 --> 00:08:49,913
Boo!
Macaroni Man.

202
00:08:49,915 --> 00:08:52,015
Still can't believe
you won that contest.

203
00:08:53,752 --> 00:08:55,752
<i>Next stop,</i>
<i>Amazin' headquarters,</i>

204
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,654
<i>your one shop</i>
<i>for online shopping.</i>

205
00:08:57,656 --> 00:09:01,591
<i>When you go to work here,</i>
<i>you'll say, "It's Amazin'."</i>

206
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:13,236
I soldered
all those motherboards,

207
00:09:13,238 --> 00:09:14,638
installed all
the spyware.

208
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,373
Tickets are all clear.
Already?

209
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,575
Damn, dude!
Hey, we get paid by the hour.

210
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:20,510
You've got to move slower.

211
00:09:20,512 --> 00:09:22,779
They'll expect all of us
to be that fast.

212
00:09:22,781 --> 00:09:24,483
Ooh! New ticket.

213
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:29,120
"Mouse needs new batteries"?

214
00:09:29,122 --> 00:09:30,520
Oh, man.
There you go.

215
00:09:30,522 --> 00:09:31,955
Go crush that one, superstar.

216
00:09:31,957 --> 00:09:33,857
It's up in the Llama Dolly?

217
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,761
I've never been in there.

218
00:09:37,763 --> 00:09:41,264
Worked here eight years, never
set foot in the Llama Dolly.

219
00:09:41,266 --> 00:09:42,866
They say
it's a functional spaceship

220
00:09:42,868 --> 00:09:45,435
and everyone who built it
had their minds erased.

221
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:48,705
The elevator only has
one button -- up.

222
00:09:48,707 --> 00:09:50,707
No one comes down.
No one.

223
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:52,842
You heard of Neil?
He lives in there.

224
00:09:52,844 --> 00:09:54,044
Llama Dolly?

225
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,512
Why don't they just call it
the Dalai Lama?

226
00:09:55,514 --> 00:09:57,814
She-shay-shush!
Never call it that.

227
00:09:57,816 --> 00:09:59,983
He named it that because
he did not want to insult

228
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:01,818
his best friend,
His Holiness.

229
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,353
He's friends with
the Dalai Lama?

230
00:10:03,355 --> 00:10:05,789
Don't say that!
There's microphones everywhere.

231
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,859
And whatever you do, don't say
anything about his, you know.

232
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:11,162
About his what?

233
00:10:11,164 --> 00:10:15,399
There's a rumor we,
of course, do not believe --

234
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:18,905
right? -- that he's
4 inches tall.

235
00:10:21,141 --> 00:10:22,640
You sure you're
up for this, Phoenix?

236
00:10:22,642 --> 00:10:24,341
I lived with an
asshole for 15 years, man.

237
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:25,609
I think I can handle Neil.

238
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:27,678
Oh! We didn't
say he was an asshole,

239
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,080
just that he's small
and he lives in

240
00:10:29,082 --> 00:10:30,681
a spaceship disguised
as an animal.

241
00:10:30,683 --> 00:10:32,316
Geez, some hang-ups
there, Phoenix.

242
00:10:32,318 --> 00:10:35,319
Is that a really real name?
Phoenix?

243
00:10:35,321 --> 00:10:36,954
Like the bird that
arose from the ashes?

244
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:39,890
No, like the capital of Arizona.
What do you think?

245
00:10:39,892 --> 00:10:41,093
Okay, okay.

246
00:10:41,095 --> 00:10:42,560
Everyone give
Phoenix some space,

247
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,061
'cause that's definitely
his real name.

248
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:46,697
Dude, for what it's worth,
I do think it's a cool name.

249
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:03,414
Warriors!

250
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,416
Come out and play-ay!

251
00:11:05,418 --> 00:11:06,817
That's right.

252
00:11:06,819 --> 00:11:10,188
I'm the Bloods and the Crips
all in one can.

253
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:16,827
Boo!
Ah, damn it!

254
00:11:16,829 --> 00:11:18,796
Where'd you come from?
The roof.

255
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,931
I thought you vampires
got to be invited in.

256
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,600
Not when you own the place.

257
00:11:22,602 --> 00:11:25,002
Who invited <i>you</i> in?
It's condemned.

258
00:11:25,004 --> 00:11:27,239
I-I come in here
to chase off, uh,

259
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:28,606
rival street gangs.
Oh.

260
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,374
They just spray-painted
this and run off.

261
00:11:30,376 --> 00:11:32,543
"Animal magnetizm."

262
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:35,479
"Scorpians ruuulez"
spelled wrong.

263
00:11:35,481 --> 00:11:37,081
I guess kids today
still like

264
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:39,617
quality East German metal
from the '80s.

265
00:11:39,619 --> 00:11:42,019
But this house is
an eyesore, Markula.

266
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:44,588
It's dragging down
my property values.

267
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,724
Tell you what. I'm gonna
make you a generous offer,

268
00:11:46,726 --> 00:11:48,058
take this off your hands.

269
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,428
So you can flip it?
I wasn't born yesterday.

270
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,166
I was born
40,000 years ago.

271
00:11:54,168 --> 00:11:57,701
Okay. All right. You got me.
I'm old now, too.

272
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:00,172
Slap a coat of paint on this,
and you're gonna be

273
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:01,672
so friggin' rich, dude.

274
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:04,276
Amazin's gobbling up
everything in the neighborhood.

275
00:12:04,278 --> 00:12:05,876
Yes! Yeah, boy!

276
00:12:05,878 --> 00:12:07,145
Yeeeeah!

277
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:09,214
B-B-Boy-boy-boy-ba-boy!

278
00:12:09,216 --> 00:12:11,816
You remember them food freaks
living there?
Oh, yes.

279
00:12:11,818 --> 00:12:14,286
So many times I was like,
"I'm out. I'm done.

280
00:12:14,288 --> 00:12:17,421
And I rented to them
just to annoy you.

281
00:12:17,423 --> 00:12:19,423
All that time
being pissed off.

282
00:12:19,425 --> 00:12:21,992
That's why I'm bald --
not genetics, the anger.

283
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:24,428
Hanging out with them,
it took years off my life.

284
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,063
So did the asbestos,
probably.

285
00:12:26,065 --> 00:12:28,399
I never took it out
like the city told me.

286
00:12:29,869 --> 00:12:33,037
Living here is finally
gonna to pay off, brother.

287
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:36,241
For once in my life,
happiness.
Hooray!

288
00:12:36,243 --> 00:12:38,509
True, genuine happiness!

289
00:12:38,511 --> 00:12:40,544
Come on, baby.
Stretch it harder, Neil.

290
00:12:40,546 --> 00:12:42,680
Ooh, you're growing taller.
I can see it.

291
00:12:42,682 --> 00:12:44,849
I can see you growing.
It's miraculous.

292
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:47,618
Come on, crank it up, Neil.
Elongate yourself, Neil.

293
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,819
Come on,
we're in that homestretch.

294
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:50,188
Get it?
'Cause we're stretching.

295
00:12:50,190 --> 00:12:51,956
Hello? Someone call
about mouse batteries?

296
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,557
Quick, grab that pen
and tape measure

297
00:12:53,559 --> 00:12:55,260
and meet me at the doorframe,
quickly, quickly, now!

298
00:12:55,262 --> 00:12:56,493
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
Mark it.

299
00:12:56,495 --> 00:12:57,895
Mark it before I shrink.

300
00:12:57,897 --> 00:12:59,630
Uh, you want me
to put a date?
Yeah.

301
00:12:59,632 --> 00:13:02,366
It's pretty much the same as
last month and the month before.

302
00:13:02,368 --> 00:13:03,667
Impossible. Let me see.

303
00:13:03,669 --> 00:13:04,935
You marked
from the crown of my head?

304
00:13:04,937 --> 00:13:07,973
Yeah.
I knew it wasn't working, Elmer!

305
00:13:07,975 --> 00:13:09,643
Blip-Blop,
new doorframe now.

306
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:13,044
You, fix this machine.
It's not working.

307
00:13:13,046 --> 00:13:15,348
That's why I called you.
Not mouse batteries. Okay?

308
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:18,351
I'm not an idiot. Would an idiot
be able to build this company?

309
00:13:18,353 --> 00:13:21,220
This is what
a smart person does.

310
00:13:22,489 --> 00:13:23,688
Now I definitely
can't fix it.

311
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,191
Do not speak a word
about this.

312
00:13:25,193 --> 00:13:27,692
Blip-Blop, pull up an NDA.
Here, sign this.

313
00:13:27,694 --> 00:13:30,329
You will go to jail if
you say anything about my size,

314
00:13:30,331 --> 00:13:32,030
which is perfect for
a man of my height.

315
00:13:32,032 --> 00:13:34,267
You're not that small.
I mean, I was told you were --

316
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:35,500
4 inches tall?

317
00:13:35,502 --> 00:13:37,136
Elon Musk spread that rumor.

318
00:13:37,138 --> 00:13:38,371
He's nothing but a battery pimp

319
00:13:38,373 --> 00:13:39,938
who likes to have
sex with his batteries.

320
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,773
Tell that to everyone you know.
Let's get that going.

321
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:43,942
Blip-Blop,
new machine now.

322
00:13:43,944 --> 00:13:46,178
Do not drop it.
Do not drop it.

323
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:49,414
D'oh!
Hum! Find my center.

324
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,417
Hum! Breathe into my body,
out, release.

325
00:13:52,419 --> 00:13:54,786
Hum!

326
00:13:54,788 --> 00:13:58,056
Okay. Ha ha. Sorry.
It's been a rough morning.

327
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:00,458
I'm usually way
taller than this. I'm Neil.

328
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,460
Phoenix. You ain't gonna
get taller

329
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:03,895
strapping yourself
to a rack.

330
00:14:03,897 --> 00:14:05,730
But you could clone yourself
and splice the DNA

331
00:14:05,732 --> 00:14:07,065
with a taller protein.

332
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:09,402
Like steak? No, I'm vegan.
I don't eat steak.

333
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:12,470
Are you aware that the
beef industry is responsible for

334
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:15,274
over 30% if carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere?

335
00:14:15,276 --> 00:14:18,543
Or is it carbon monoxide?
Blip-Blop, which is the bad one?

336
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:20,879
No, not at all like steak.
Oh. Great.

337
00:14:20,881 --> 00:14:22,881
I mean, of course,
it's a very complicated process.

338
00:14:22,883 --> 00:14:26,051
To clone me? Sure.
But two Neils. I like it.

339
00:14:26,053 --> 00:14:28,520
Do it, now. Blip-Blop,
make him do it now.

340
00:14:28,522 --> 00:14:29,754
<i>Sorry.</i>
<i>I don't understand.</i>

341
00:14:29,756 --> 00:14:32,224
Aah!
DNA. You were talking.

342
00:14:32,226 --> 00:14:33,959
I rudely interrupted. Go!

343
00:14:33,961 --> 00:14:35,760
Look, it's risky.
I've done it before,

344
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:37,330
but I've never quite got
the sequencing right...

345
00:14:37,332 --> 00:14:39,332
Sequencing right.
Sequencing right.

346
00:14:39,334 --> 00:14:40,598
Sequencing right.

347
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:44,903
Whoa! Damn! It worked.
Yes!

348
00:14:44,905 --> 00:14:47,872
Ignore me now, women.
Toss me the rock.

349
00:14:47,874 --> 00:14:49,774
Wait a minute.
I'm the ball?

350
00:14:49,776 --> 00:14:52,111
What you say goes unheard.

351
00:14:52,113 --> 00:14:54,180
Why didn't everybody
just buy a ball?

352
00:14:54,182 --> 00:14:57,283
I call upon the power
of Grayskull...
Don't do this.

353
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:59,818
...to dunk on Meatwad's ass.
Please don't do this.

354
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,020
Vanilla Wonder!
Oh, this sucks.

355
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:04,956
Aah! Oh!

356
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,958
Shit, man,
I got the splice wrong.

357
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,362
Whoa!
Look at your leg, dude.

358
00:15:09,364 --> 00:15:11,464
That is graphic
and funny.

359
00:15:11,466 --> 00:15:13,366
Foul! Charging on Carl!

360
00:15:13,368 --> 00:15:15,301
Huge, huge side effects.

361
00:15:15,303 --> 00:15:17,470
I need more research,
more experiments.

362
00:15:17,472 --> 00:15:19,438
But, in theory,
it should work.

363
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,072
Well, maybe we
can make that happen.

364
00:15:21,074 --> 00:15:22,907
You down in I.T.,
rotting away?

365
00:15:22,909 --> 00:15:26,011
Been there a few months, been
crushing it, if I say so myself.

366
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:27,746
Well, now you're
up here with me,

367
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:28,980
making me taller.

368
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:31,018
Let me show you the operation.

369
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:35,388
This is it, the Llama Dolly.

370
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:37,889
The Llama-dama-ding-dong!

371
00:15:37,891 --> 00:15:40,192
It's my bitching house
and nothing more,

372
00:15:40,194 --> 00:15:43,295
regardless of what anyone
or Elon Musk says.

373
00:15:43,297 --> 00:15:49,069
Well, you know, down in I.T.,
they said it might be, uh...

374
00:15:50,204 --> 00:15:52,371
...you know...

375
00:15:52,373 --> 00:15:54,072
spaceship.
Spaceship?
That's a boldface lie.

376
00:15:54,074 --> 00:15:55,774
Who told you that?
What are their names?

377
00:15:55,776 --> 00:15:58,210
Oh, I don't remember.
I just heard it around
the coffee machine.

378
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:01,046
Well, that could narrow it down,
because not everybody
drinks coffee.

379
00:16:01,048 --> 00:16:03,183
Blip-Blop, establish
cross-referencing database

380
00:16:03,185 --> 00:16:06,018
of everyone who works in I.T.
with everyone who drinks coffee.

381
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,620
You're talking to your hand,
Neil.

382
00:16:07,622 --> 00:16:09,191
I mean, you threw your phone.
Remember?

383
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,462
Wow!

384
00:16:15,464 --> 00:16:17,663
Talking back on day one.

385
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:19,065
You have your own opinions.

386
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,634
You're not afraid to
speak your mind. I like it.

387
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:25,037
But what I say into my hand
is none of your business.

388
00:16:25,039 --> 00:16:26,906
Sorry, man.
Won't happen again.

389
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:29,509
No, it will not.
Scratch that database.

390
00:16:29,511 --> 00:16:31,811
This is my hand,
as we both know.

391
00:16:31,813 --> 00:16:33,513
Hanging up now.

392
00:16:33,515 --> 00:16:35,315
And here's
my fulfillment center,

393
00:16:35,317 --> 00:16:38,617
run entirely by Fraptackulans
and Japangaloids.

394
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:41,887
They traveled the galaxy for the
opportunity to work here.

395
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:43,223
I thought those two races
hated each other.

396
00:16:43,225 --> 00:16:45,791
They're mortal enemies,
but at Amazin',

397
00:16:45,793 --> 00:16:48,095
we're all one big happy family,
right, guys?

398
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:50,830
If I slip on your
Japangaloid slime one more time,

399
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:52,232
I'm speaking to
your supervisor.

400
00:16:52,234 --> 00:16:56,103
Ha ha! I <i>am</i> the supervisor,
Crap-tackulan.

401
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:58,238
It is "Fraptackulan"
with an "F,"

402
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,540
not "Craptackulan"
with a "C."

403
00:17:00,542 --> 00:17:02,242
And you know that.

404
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:04,610
How's that feel?
You wanna go?!

405
00:17:04,612 --> 00:17:06,480
You like that, crap-man?!

406
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:09,851
There they go again. Blip-Blop,
release the sub-mist.

407
00:17:11,652 --> 00:17:14,387
Weird. The hand works. Wow.

408
00:17:14,389 --> 00:17:17,857
I'm so sorry, man.
Oh, no.

409
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:20,093
Your skin came off
when I hugged you.

410
00:17:20,095 --> 00:17:22,795
It's cool.
I molt like three times a day.

411
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:24,897
All good. No worries.

412
00:17:24,899 --> 00:17:28,101
Is that sub-mist legal?
Sure smells good.

413
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:29,536
It's like Xanax,
but it's free.

414
00:17:29,538 --> 00:17:32,771
People take that. Is that legal?
So many questions.

415
00:17:32,773 --> 00:17:37,110
My hiding machine -- in pieces!
It's ruined!

416
00:17:37,112 --> 00:17:39,879
And this is Elmer,
my head of R&D,

417
00:17:39,881 --> 00:17:42,948
Elmer is the gaping asshole
who thought that machine

418
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:46,453
was gonna make me taller,
instead of making me madder.

419
00:17:46,455 --> 00:17:50,656
Sentient French-fried potatoes?
You're floating. How?

420
00:17:50,658 --> 00:17:52,259
Whoa! Okay, okay.
Easy, now, man.

421
00:17:52,261 --> 00:17:55,529
Is this jewel decorative or does
it serve practical purposes?

422
00:17:55,531 --> 00:17:57,297
Okay. Down, boy.

423
00:17:57,299 --> 00:18:00,333
Elmer's pretty bright,
just not socially stable.

424
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:03,336
Don't you agree, Elmer,
that you're sweaty?

425
00:18:03,338 --> 00:18:05,238
What is this?

426
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,307
Oh, that's peanut oil.
Of course.

427
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:09,576
Aah!
Sorry, man.
I-I said back off.

428
00:18:09,578 --> 00:18:13,146
Light amplified by stimulated
emissions of radiation?

429
00:18:13,148 --> 00:18:15,115
We all know
what a laser is, Elmer.

430
00:18:15,117 --> 00:18:16,882
Martin Landau shot them
frequently

431
00:18:16,884 --> 00:18:18,920
on the moon base
in "Space: 1999."

432
00:18:19,854 --> 00:18:21,555
What are you growing there?

433
00:18:21,557 --> 00:18:24,291
Walk vines.

434
00:18:24,293 --> 00:18:26,195
Come to me.

435
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,828
Vines?

436
00:18:29,830 --> 00:18:31,730
Show these men
what I've been working on.

437
00:18:31,732 --> 00:18:33,600
Why won't you come to me?

438
00:18:33,602 --> 00:18:34,867
I'm a friend.
You can open up to me.

439
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:36,603
Yeah, he's trying to
teach the vines

440
00:18:36,605 --> 00:18:38,104
to respond to
verbal commands.

441
00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:39,738
I'll start.
How is your day going?

442
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,274
But it ain't happening,
is it, Elmer?

443
00:18:41,276 --> 00:18:43,243
They're being
passive-aggressive.

444
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:45,778
They refuse to learn.
And they're just plants, though.

445
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,147
Bad vines!

446
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:49,649
Listen, Elmer,
I have to cancel dinner tonight.

447
00:18:49,651 --> 00:18:51,151
Something came up.

448
00:18:51,153 --> 00:18:52,885
Phoenix, what do you have
going on tonight for dinner?

449
00:18:52,887 --> 00:18:54,554
Elmer just canceled.

450
00:18:54,556 --> 00:18:57,190
You said something came up.
Yeah, that's what I told <i>you.</i>

451
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:59,893
I'm telling my new friend
something else, Elmer.

452
00:18:59,895 --> 00:19:01,895
I suppose
I'm free tonight.

453
00:19:01,897 --> 00:19:04,398
Dinner, me, you, my house,

454
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,534
the Llama-dama-ding-dong!

455
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:09,372
Tonight,
it's going down!

456
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,939
You'll eat with me,
won't you, my seedlings?

457
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:16,644
I've prepared a hot meal,
a fertilizer feast.

458
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:18,713
What do you mean, "Did this come
out of your butt?"

459
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:20,147
Of course it came from my butt.

460
00:19:20,149 --> 00:19:21,582
You know,
you liked it yesterday,

461
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:23,850
so I'm not sure what
the big kick is here.

462
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:27,787
And now for a little me time.

463
00:19:27,789 --> 00:19:29,523
Ooh! There we go.

464
00:19:29,525 --> 00:19:32,025
There she is. Mm!

465
00:19:32,027 --> 00:19:33,860
That's right, baby.
I'm looking at you.

466
00:19:33,862 --> 00:19:35,363
Carl!
Damn it!

467
00:19:35,365 --> 00:19:39,300
My brother from another mother!
Long time, no see!

468
00:19:39,302 --> 00:19:42,002
Hey, what are you doing
with your penis there?

469
00:19:42,004 --> 00:19:43,537
You're gonna break it
if you keep doing that.

470
00:19:43,539 --> 00:19:45,740
Don't look over there.
Just push through.

471
00:19:45,742 --> 00:19:48,041
Wow! Did they not
mention the pool?

472
00:19:48,043 --> 00:19:49,710
That's got to be
worth another 4 or 5K.

473
00:19:49,712 --> 00:19:51,178
He's right.

474
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,847
I said Olympic-sized pool,
and it ain't on here.

475
00:19:53,849 --> 00:19:56,217
Getting soft here!
The moment's passed!

476
00:19:56,219 --> 00:19:58,286
I see you're still rockin'
them sweats.

477
00:19:58,288 --> 00:19:59,953
Neighborhood's looking great,
by the way.

478
00:19:59,955 --> 00:20:02,423
I told you me living here
would create value.

479
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:04,858
Oh, yeah, good call.
I'll meet you at the door.

480
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:08,763
What?

481
00:20:08,765 --> 00:20:10,930
Bring it in,
Carlito's Way.

482
00:20:10,932 --> 00:20:12,266
Oh, you reek.

483
00:20:12,268 --> 00:20:13,967
No, no, no.
We're not hugging here.

484
00:20:13,969 --> 00:20:15,869
Make it quick,
and then I'm calling the cops.

485
00:20:15,871 --> 00:20:18,205
Oh, whoa.
That is hurtful.

486
00:20:18,207 --> 00:20:19,674
I just wanted to check in
and see how you're doing.

487
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,007
You know.
No.

488
00:20:21,009 --> 00:20:22,909
And I don't feel comfortable
under that bridge.

489
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,345
No. Get your foot
out of there.

490
00:20:24,347 --> 00:20:25,780
No! No! Get --

491
00:20:25,782 --> 00:20:30,083
Okay, look, before you say no,
all I need is the three S's --

492
00:20:30,085 --> 00:20:32,988
shower, shit, and a sundae
with hot fudge.

493
00:20:33,556 --> 00:20:35,156
Don't you feel this, bro?

494
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:37,857
Mmm! With me here,
it's a hang.

495
00:20:37,859 --> 00:20:39,427
Alright,
let's cut to the chase.

496
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:41,629
You want to crash here
for free?

497
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,197
Just a few months, Carl.

498
00:20:43,199 --> 00:20:45,533
It's so tough out there
for guys like me

499
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,867
who don't want to have
anything to do with work.

500
00:20:47,869 --> 00:20:49,403
Don't --
Don't cry here.

501
00:20:49,405 --> 00:20:52,273
I know we got shared history
here. I ain't forgotten.

502
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:55,778
I can probably make one room
available to you.

503
00:20:56,579 --> 00:21:00,181
It's a real cozy starter home.
Bigger than it looks, too.

504
00:21:00,183 --> 00:21:03,317
And look at that, huh?
It's got new windows put in.

505
00:21:03,319 --> 00:21:05,919
So, we gonna just put it
right in the living room or...?

506
00:21:05,921 --> 00:21:08,021
No, no, no.
We'll keep it back here

507
00:21:08,023 --> 00:21:10,224
where no one from the road
can see you.

508
00:21:10,226 --> 00:21:12,226
And don't you even
look at that pool.

509
00:21:12,228 --> 00:21:15,596
And where am I
going to shave?
Hey, this is what
I'm offering.

510
00:21:15,598 --> 00:21:17,798
If you don't like it,
you live with the Fry man.

511
00:21:19,034 --> 00:21:20,701
Frylock is dead to me.

512
00:21:20,703 --> 00:21:22,536
I'll never speak with him again,

513
00:21:22,538 --> 00:21:25,038
but I might want to
troll him via text,

514
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,440
so I'd need
his new cell number.

515
00:21:26,442 --> 00:21:27,575
Do you have it?

516
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:30,644
What up, Neil?
No, that sucks. Hey, Neil.

517
00:21:30,646 --> 00:21:32,847
I-I made my famous
strawberry shortcake.

518
00:21:32,849 --> 00:21:35,449
Short. Damn it. He'll think
I'm making fun of him.

519
00:21:35,451 --> 00:21:37,917
Stupid! Why didn't
I just bring wine?

520
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,053
Nice jewel, French fry.

521
00:21:40,055 --> 00:21:41,856
It'd look a lot nicer
around my neck.

522
00:21:41,858 --> 00:21:44,091
Yeah. Yeah. Thank you.
See you later.

523
00:21:44,093 --> 00:21:45,326
It ain't a compliment.

524
00:21:45,328 --> 00:21:47,094
I want it.
Yeah, hash brown.

525
00:21:47,096 --> 00:21:48,396
Neil, Neil,
come on. Open the door.

526
00:21:48,398 --> 00:21:49,996
Neil! Help. Help!
Get your ass over here.

527
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:52,367
Stab, stabby, stab.

528
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:53,568
There it is.

529
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,105
Hyah! Get out of here,
street toughs!

530
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,543
Phoenix, no!

531
00:22:05,682 --> 00:22:08,583
Oh, come on. Come on.

532
00:22:08,585 --> 00:22:11,455
Frickin' lotionless.

533
00:22:16,326 --> 00:22:18,360
Aw, man.

534
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:21,596
I bet it's cold out there.

535
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,402
Damn it.

536
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:29,704
Fire! Fire! Fire!

537
00:22:29,706 --> 00:22:31,139
Stop, drop, and roll!

538
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,509
I'm like if the
Impractical Jokers had balls.

539
00:22:34,511 --> 00:22:36,812
What kind of joke
is that?

540
00:22:36,814 --> 00:22:38,012
Good one, Carl.

541
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:39,381
What happened?

542
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:41,149
It's okay. You're okay, Phoenix.
Don't get up.

543
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:43,618
Cut, clarity, color.

544
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,153
The geometry is perfect.

545
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,622
My jewel. No, no.
It shouldn't be detached.

546
00:22:47,624 --> 00:22:49,524
I need that back.
Who would do this?

547
00:22:49,526 --> 00:22:52,194
We're investigating.
They left a clue.

548
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:54,061
Strawberry shortcake.

549
00:22:54,063 --> 00:22:55,363
They obviously came
to make fun of me.

550
00:22:55,365 --> 00:22:57,232
Is that my box?
It's ripped to shreds!

551
00:22:57,234 --> 00:22:59,534
I'm disfigured!
Oh, my God.

552
00:22:59,536 --> 00:23:01,136
Look, I know
this was traumatic,

553
00:23:01,138 --> 00:23:02,904
but I have creepy Elmer
working on this

554
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:05,474
and all of the resources
of my incredible company.

555
00:23:05,476 --> 00:23:08,510
Soon, you'll be a Phoenix
rising from the ashes.

556
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,745
And not just that hot,
dry city in Arizona.

557
00:23:10,747 --> 00:23:12,814
Uh, no, thanks. I don't need to
go right now, man.

558
00:23:12,816 --> 00:23:14,749
It's not a bedpan.

559
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:18,153
It's your new box that Neil
made me make for you.

560
00:23:18,155 --> 00:23:19,788
It's made of brotanium,

561
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,791
the lightest-yet-strongest
material known to man.

562
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:24,159
Look it up.

563
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,361
It's stronger than anything
in the MCU,

564
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,796
even stronger than vibranium,

565
00:23:27,798 --> 00:23:29,965
which we're allowed to say
but not show.

566
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:31,299
Damn! For real?

567
00:23:31,301 --> 00:23:34,169
It's devised by Elmer
but named by me,

568
00:23:34,171 --> 00:23:36,438
because Elmernesium
is a dumb name.

569
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,806
Don't we agree on that?
Yep.

570
00:23:37,808 --> 00:23:39,708
You're right 'cause you're
the boss and everything.

571
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,942
I, like, suck.

572
00:23:40,944 --> 00:23:42,878
Here, let's see if it fits
around your brains.

573
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,348
Hell yeah!

574
00:23:52,523 --> 00:23:54,890
I got these pits smelling
lemony-citrus

575
00:23:54,892 --> 00:23:56,658
and dishwasher-safe.

576
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:00,097
And now, time to activate
the gravy.

577
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:02,898
Oh. Yeah.

578
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,666
Mmm! Mmm!

579
00:24:04,668 --> 00:24:06,735
Fish and egg and cheddar?

580
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,104
Whoda thunk
they'd go well together?

581
00:24:09,106 --> 00:24:12,107
I'll tell you who.
The dogs here.

582
00:24:12,109 --> 00:24:14,376
Uh-oh. Oh, hey, Liz!

583
00:24:14,378 --> 00:24:15,744
So you <i>are</i> sleeping here.

584
00:24:15,746 --> 00:24:17,812
I'm not sleeping here
during the day.

585
00:24:17,814 --> 00:24:19,614
Come on, girl.

586
00:24:19,616 --> 00:24:20,849
Just at nighttime.

587
00:24:20,851 --> 00:24:22,450
I'm sorry, Meatwad.

588
00:24:22,452 --> 00:24:25,987
We're a charity, but our charity
only extends so far.
How far?

589
00:24:25,989 --> 00:24:27,756
Aah!

590
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:31,693
Ugh! That's pretty far.
You got you a good arm, Liz.

591
00:24:31,695 --> 00:24:35,597
Good luck, Meatwad!
Please do not come back!

592
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:38,934
I'm adding a really cool
bonus room, Carl.

593
00:24:38,936 --> 00:24:41,336
Hey, maybe I'll invite you over
for some air hockey later.

594
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:43,471
Yeah. No, thanks.
Meat man. What's up?

595
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:44,873
Hey, Carl.
How you doing?

596
00:24:44,875 --> 00:24:46,441
He's doing fine.
Can I help you?

597
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,877
I was talking to Carl.

598
00:24:47,879 --> 00:24:50,580
And now you're talking to me.
And I'm here to tell you

599
00:24:50,582 --> 00:24:54,417
there is no room at the inn,
so just roll along, now.

600
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:56,352
Bye-bye.
Shake, come on, man.

601
00:24:56,354 --> 00:24:58,754
Relax. We'll break ground
on another condo.

602
00:24:58,756 --> 00:25:01,123
You mean it, a place
of my very own?

603
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:03,392
Just got another house
in the mail.

604
00:25:03,394 --> 00:25:06,462
Look, at this.
12 bedrooms.
Wow.

605
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:10,132
Or you knock down these walls,
opens up the whole flow.

606
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,101
Damn, Carl,
you're a real prince.

607
00:25:12,103 --> 00:25:13,669
Something's different with you,
man.

608
00:25:13,671 --> 00:25:16,973
I ain't never seen you
so not pissed off at the world.

609
00:25:16,975 --> 00:25:18,541
You noticed that?

610
00:25:18,543 --> 00:25:22,812
I used to sleep with my
hands balled in fists of rage.

611
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:26,182
My knuckles were sore
from my angry dreams...

612
00:25:26,184 --> 00:25:27,683
because I lived
next to you.

613
00:25:27,685 --> 00:25:30,419
And now I got
a better outlook on life,

614
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:32,254
'cause I'm about to
get paid, son.

615
00:25:35,259 --> 00:25:36,792
That's our old house,
ain't it?

616
00:25:36,794 --> 00:25:39,195
Yeah, that's where I barely
let you live.

617
00:25:39,197 --> 00:25:41,564
Who's ordering stuff
over here?

618
00:25:41,566 --> 00:25:44,900
Yeah, and laying those boxes
down in perfect rows.

619
00:25:44,902 --> 00:25:47,670
Like so many
ears of corn.

620
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,172
Yeah, I already went through
them. They're all pretty empty.

621
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:51,407
You grab what you want.

622
00:25:51,409 --> 00:25:53,342
But these ain't
addressed to you.

623
00:25:53,344 --> 00:25:54,744
And, yet, I received them.

624
00:25:54,746 --> 00:25:57,046
Alright, look,
here at Carl Acres,

625
00:25:57,048 --> 00:25:58,681
taxes are pretty high.

626
00:25:58,683 --> 00:26:00,616
And they're assessed
weekly -- cash.

627
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:02,685
A property tax?

628
00:26:02,687 --> 00:26:04,654
I took to the road
so I didn't have to

629
00:26:04,656 --> 00:26:06,255
deal with
such responsibilities.

630
00:26:06,257 --> 00:26:07,857
Look, I don't know
what to tell you.

631
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,926
Home ownership is a very
important part of owning a home.

632
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:13,529
I hear that.
Now, if you're
gonna live here,

633
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:17,066
you're gonna follow my rules
and you're gonna earn.

634
00:26:17,068 --> 00:26:19,802
Okay, the sauna detoxifies,

635
00:26:19,804 --> 00:26:22,471
and the ice bath
freezes the toxins.

636
00:26:22,473 --> 00:26:23,706
Whoo, it's cold!

637
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:25,608
Give me one more.
I'm not helping.

638
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:27,943
You got this.

639
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:29,146
Whoo!
Hey, down low.

640
00:26:29,148 --> 00:26:30,346
Oh, okay.

641
00:26:30,348 --> 00:26:31,714
Now back to the sauna,

642
00:26:31,716 --> 00:26:34,550
but only for a second,
then the ice bath again,

643
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:36,185
and then the sauna again.

644
00:26:36,187 --> 00:26:37,820
Are we allowed
to use soap or...?

645
00:26:37,822 --> 00:26:40,523
Yes, but the soap is
infused with scorpions.

646
00:26:40,525 --> 00:26:43,459
Whatever doesn't kill you makes
you -- I don't remember.

647
00:26:43,461 --> 00:26:45,327
Quickly, bathe like I do.

648
00:26:45,329 --> 00:26:47,263
I look crazy, man.

649
00:26:47,265 --> 00:26:48,531
See?
The crazier you look,

650
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:50,833
the smarter Wall Street
thinks you are.

651
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:53,469
Ow. Ow, ow.
The venom glands
of the scorpion,

652
00:26:53,471 --> 00:26:55,172
they release toxins.
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ah.

653
00:26:55,174 --> 00:26:56,405
And do you know what
that means?

654
00:26:56,407 --> 00:26:57,740
Back to the sauna?
Yes.

655
00:26:57,742 --> 00:27:01,111
To detoxify.
You're learning, Phoenix.

656
00:27:01,113 --> 00:27:02,344
Aah!

657
00:27:02,346 --> 00:27:03,913
Ooh! Ooh!
Yeah.

658
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:06,782
It's my private discotheque.
I don't even know why I own it.

659
00:27:06,784 --> 00:27:09,218
You're the first person I've
ever allowed to dance in here.

660
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:10,419
You're pretty good.

661
00:27:10,421 --> 00:27:11,620
You're a good dancer,
too, Neil.

662
00:27:11,622 --> 00:27:14,590
Albino Bengal tiger.

663
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:17,593
There's only eight of them
in the civilized world.

664
00:27:17,595 --> 00:27:20,863
And now there's seven.
Whoa! Neil, what the fuck?!

665
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:23,499
Uh, I'm sorry.
Why did you do that?

666
00:27:23,501 --> 00:27:26,402
Did you not think that was cool,
me showcasing my power?

667
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:27,837
Hell, no,
that's not cool, man.

668
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:31,741
Oh, I am so sorry, Phoenix.
Please forgive me.

669
00:27:31,743 --> 00:27:34,243
I never valued
anyone's opinion before

670
00:27:34,245 --> 00:27:35,878
because mine
were so great.

671
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:38,481
I'm just feeling
this vibe with us, man.

672
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:39,915
It's okay, Neil.
It makes me crazy.

673
00:27:39,917 --> 00:27:43,154
I'm feeling the vibe, too.
But what about your tiger?

674
00:27:43,156 --> 00:27:44,387
Should we help
your tiger now?

675
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:46,157
I don't know.
What do you think?

676
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:47,991
See?
I asked your opinion.

677
00:27:47,993 --> 00:27:51,828
No more tiger shooting
because of what you said.

678
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,797
My friend.

679
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,432
Wait. Hold on.

680
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:05,509
Yes. It's stable.
It's holding.

681
00:28:05,511 --> 00:28:08,945
Uh, my ankle's weakening!

682
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,048
Wrong again.

683
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:14,851
So sorry, Neil.
We're close. I know it.

684
00:28:14,853 --> 00:28:17,255
Hey, get back to the warehouse
and work.

685
00:28:17,257 --> 00:28:21,391
But how?
I don't know, but those boxes
don't deliver themselves.

686
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:23,960
Not yet anyway.

687
00:28:23,962 --> 00:28:25,295
Elmer!

688
00:28:25,297 --> 00:28:28,665
Never open your mouth unless you
have something smart to say!

689
00:28:28,667 --> 00:28:30,300
Only Phoenix is the smart one!

690
00:28:30,302 --> 00:28:31,735
Guess I don't know
what I'm talking about,

691
00:28:31,737 --> 00:28:33,403
even though I constantly know
what I'm talking about.

692
00:28:33,405 --> 00:28:34,604
Neil, I just want
to thank you, man,

693
00:28:34,606 --> 00:28:35,806
for putting
your faith in me.

694
00:28:35,808 --> 00:28:37,440
For the first time
in my life,

695
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:41,145
I feel valued,
respected, actually liked.

696
00:28:41,147 --> 00:28:43,147
I feel like
I have a friend.

697
00:28:43,149 --> 00:28:45,249
You do have
a friend, Phoenix.

698
00:28:45,251 --> 00:28:46,817
An amazin' friend.

699
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:50,288
Here at Amazin',
we have amazin' products,

700
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,988
amazin' deliveries,

701
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,690
amazin' employees,

702
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,860
<i>and amazin' employee bathrooms.</i>
Whoa! Was that Frylock?

703
00:28:56,862 --> 00:28:58,528
<i>And despite</i>
<i>what the media says,</i>

704
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,864
<i>no one is forced to urinate</i>
<i>in a bottle</i>

705
00:29:00,866 --> 00:29:03,033
<i>unless they want to,</i>
<i>which they can</i>

706
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,569
<i>because it's their God-given</i>
<i>right, and we support that.</i>

707
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:07,003
<i>Right, Llama Dolly?</i>

708
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:10,674
<i>When you get your</i>
<i>Amazin' shipment, you'll say...</i>

709
00:29:10,676 --> 00:29:12,976
<i>It's Amazin'!</i>

710
00:29:12,978 --> 00:29:15,946
Dorks. And that's where
we're working tonight,

711
00:29:15,948 --> 00:29:18,448
earning your keep.
I hear it's fun over there.

712
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,783
I miss being part
of a team.

713
00:29:19,785 --> 00:29:21,185
Y'all remember
Aqua Teen?

714
00:29:21,187 --> 00:29:24,222
No, we ain't working for that
Neil bloodsucker.

715
00:29:24,224 --> 00:29:27,023
Half his employees are on
food stamps, pissing in bottles.

716
00:29:27,025 --> 00:29:29,626
Yeah, my cousin's a teamster,
told me all about it.

717
00:29:29,628 --> 00:29:33,463
And he's hiring us to visit
with Amazin' employees

718
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:36,202
and show them the benefits
of being in a union.

719
00:29:36,802 --> 00:29:38,935
Yeah!
Carl, what are you doing?

720
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:40,937
Smashing a window.

721
00:29:40,939 --> 00:29:43,207
And then we put these
pro-union leaflets

722
00:29:43,209 --> 00:29:44,507
inside the smashed windows?

723
00:29:44,509 --> 00:29:46,476
Oh, yeah, yeah.
We're like influencers.

724
00:29:46,478 --> 00:29:49,282
And this pipe
is our social media.

725
00:29:50,048 --> 00:29:52,883
Sorry about your tire.
Join a union.

726
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,518
Did we already
do this one?

727
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,853
Oh, are you kidding me?

728
00:29:56,855 --> 00:29:58,889
Someone double-booked
the event?

729
00:29:58,891 --> 00:30:01,024
Look at this.
They missed the taillights.

730
00:30:01,026 --> 00:30:02,826
Amateurs.
Please don't, sir, okay?

731
00:30:02,828 --> 00:30:04,427
Those gentleman over there

732
00:30:04,429 --> 00:30:07,831
already spoke to me
about <i>not</i> joining the union.

733
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:10,800
Okay, fine!
I like my shitty wages!

734
00:30:10,802 --> 00:30:13,003
Goons
hired by the company.

735
00:30:13,005 --> 00:30:15,373
No, we're goons hired
to show you

736
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:17,407
the benefits
of joining a union

737
00:30:17,409 --> 00:30:20,443
so actions like this
would stop.

738
00:30:20,445 --> 00:30:21,945
Would the union give us
enough money

739
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:24,282
to find a decent place to live
that isn't a car?

740
00:30:24,284 --> 00:30:25,815
You ain't got nowheres
to live?

741
00:30:25,817 --> 00:30:28,618
Friends,
we did not come here by choice.

742
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,187
Many moltons ago,

743
00:30:30,189 --> 00:30:33,157
our home planet of Japango
was a paradise,

744
00:30:33,159 --> 00:30:34,824
until Neil arrived.

745
00:30:34,826 --> 00:30:38,629
He offered us good jobs on Earth
with low pay and zero benefits.

746
00:30:38,631 --> 00:30:40,365
Well, that certainly
didn't add up.

747
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:41,666
Want to set your own hours

748
00:30:41,668 --> 00:30:43,634
and make six figures
working from home?

749
00:30:43,636 --> 00:30:47,872
Of course you don't.
You're too lazy to want success.

750
00:30:47,874 --> 00:30:50,409
Come work for me,
where I dictate the terms.

751
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:52,311
Of course we refused him.

752
00:30:52,313 --> 00:30:54,979
So he pushed our planet
closer to our sun,

753
00:30:54,981 --> 00:30:58,616
cackling as our crops burned and
our slime reservoirs evaporated.

754
00:30:58,618 --> 00:31:00,118
So come on, gang,

755
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,387
who wants to be part of
the Amazin' success story?

756
00:31:02,389 --> 00:31:03,888
You do.

757
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,724
So let's roll up our sleeves
and get down to business,

758
00:31:06,726 --> 00:31:07,992
or you're dead.

759
00:31:07,994 --> 00:31:10,162
We will never surrender
to you, Neil.

760
00:31:10,164 --> 00:31:12,132
And then he released
the sub-mist.

761
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,968
Sounds like a plan, Neil.
When do we start?

762
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,669
We boarded
the Llama Dolly en masse

763
00:31:18,671 --> 00:31:20,671
after paying Neil's ridiculous

764
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:23,641
moving charges
and resettlement fees.

765
00:31:23,643 --> 00:31:25,943
The whole trip to Earth
was a blur.

766
00:31:25,945 --> 00:31:27,845
And now we're wedged
in a warehouse,

767
00:31:27,847 --> 00:31:30,315
elbow-to-elbow with
Craptackulans

768
00:31:30,317 --> 00:31:33,050
Not to be racist, but they're
the shittiest race in space.

769
00:31:33,052 --> 00:31:35,454
Oh, go blow it out
your bing-bong hole!

770
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:37,822
The bing-bong hole
is not for waste.

771
00:31:37,824 --> 00:31:41,659
It's a pleasure center
and nutrient port.

772
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:43,728
I wouldn't touch you
with his moisture prongs.

773
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,997
Keep molting
all over the parking lot.

774
00:31:45,999 --> 00:31:47,665
Not even the rats
will eat it,

775
00:31:47,667 --> 00:31:48,899
'cause you're nasty!

776
00:31:48,901 --> 00:31:51,370
If my ankle weren't
so rubbery,

777
00:31:51,372 --> 00:31:53,205
I would give you
such a kick!

778
00:31:53,207 --> 00:31:55,673
Show me what you got!
You would have a big bruise.

779
00:31:55,675 --> 00:31:56,974
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

780
00:31:56,976 --> 00:31:58,642
You got to get
over your differences

781
00:31:58,644 --> 00:31:59,944
and work together here.

782
00:31:59,946 --> 00:32:02,481
Union can get you good wages,
medical care

783
00:32:02,483 --> 00:32:06,251
for whatever that is making your
skin come off in big hunks

784
00:32:06,253 --> 00:32:07,752
and making you...

785
00:32:07,754 --> 00:32:10,222
Are you ejaculating, like,
all over your body?

786
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:11,889
Weak ankles, huh?

787
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:13,291
Man, I've been there.
Don't.

788
00:32:13,293 --> 00:32:16,294
I used to dominate these streets
with the round ball,

789
00:32:16,296 --> 00:32:18,497
then I blew out
my one thick ankle.
Stop, please.

790
00:32:18,499 --> 00:32:21,133
Thanks to French fry's
little experiment.
Ow, don't.

791
00:32:21,135 --> 00:32:24,702
Wait. French fry?
Floating box of French fries?

792
00:32:24,704 --> 00:32:26,704
You know Meatwad?
You know Frylock?

793
00:32:26,706 --> 00:32:28,039
Sorry. I'm dizzy.

794
00:32:28,041 --> 00:32:31,075
Mm-hmm. We've seen him.
His name is Phoenix.

795
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:33,211
He works
in the Llama Dolly.
He's the one
who maimed me.

796
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:36,114
And he's good friends
with that asshole Neil.

797
00:32:36,116 --> 00:32:39,117
He calls himself Phoenix now?

798
00:32:39,119 --> 00:32:40,818
What kind of name
is Phoenix?

799
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,321
Call him Franklin
French Frylock.

800
00:32:43,323 --> 00:32:45,790
That's his Christian name.
Call him that.

801
00:32:45,792 --> 00:32:47,591
Oh, he hates it.

802
00:32:47,593 --> 00:32:49,494
Of course
Frylock's an asshole.

803
00:32:49,496 --> 00:32:51,662
I lived with the man
for 15 years.

804
00:32:51,664 --> 00:32:54,732
He took care
of everything.

805
00:32:54,734 --> 00:32:56,867
Then he didn't give me
an ounce of credit.

806
00:32:56,869 --> 00:32:59,870
Yeah, well, the Frylock I know
cares about people.

807
00:32:59,872 --> 00:33:01,639
No, he doesn't.

808
00:33:01,641 --> 00:33:03,241
He's not like Carl.

809
00:33:03,243 --> 00:33:07,778
Carl gave us homes, dignity,
a place to hang our hats.

810
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,381
Right, Carl?
Whoa, you ain't coming in here.

811
00:33:09,383 --> 00:33:12,551
No, I know that. I have a house
of my own, thanks to you.

812
00:33:12,553 --> 00:33:15,086
And you need to relocate it
because I don't want

813
00:33:15,088 --> 00:33:16,854
the grass getting brown
underneath.

814
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:18,390
I'm watering tonight.

815
00:33:18,392 --> 00:33:20,858
Got to keep this lush
and green for the open house.

816
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,694
Hope you got flood insurance.

817
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,467
Aw, man.
I got to shut the bay window.

818
00:33:28,469 --> 00:33:29,867
My Foosball table!

819
00:33:29,869 --> 00:33:32,138
Between you and me,
I'm thinking of moving.

820
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:35,640
Don't you move into my
neighborhood with your riffraff.

821
00:33:35,642 --> 00:33:37,709
And, uh, what's up
with the lawn?

822
00:33:37,711 --> 00:33:39,245
Are we ever gonna mow that?

823
00:33:39,247 --> 00:33:41,680
'Cause it's spilling over
onto my property line.

824
00:33:41,682 --> 00:33:43,048
I won't ask you again,
sir.

825
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,517
I was about to tell you
the same thing.

826
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,985
We have us a covenant here.
You got to keep with it.

827
00:33:46,987 --> 00:33:49,188
I'll get you written up.
Well, mine
is grandfathered in,

828
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:52,258
but I'm afraid you're gonna
need to apply for a variance

829
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:56,195
for all this overgrown brush
you seem to relish in.

830
00:33:56,197 --> 00:33:57,762
It's got my hand!
Meatwad, help!

831
00:33:57,764 --> 00:34:00,233
Form of a hot dog.
Form of an igloo.

832
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:01,300
Meatwad!

833
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:03,668
It don't respond to hot dogs
or igloos.

834
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,871
Form into
a frickin' Weedwacker!

835
00:34:05,873 --> 00:34:08,976
Let me in, Carl!
Let me in!

836
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,743
Oh, no, Err,
the movie's hanging up.

837
00:34:13,114 --> 00:34:16,115
How ever will they defeat
these mysterious plants?

838
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:17,816
They'll never know.
That's right.

839
00:34:17,818 --> 00:34:19,285
You won't, stupid viewer,

840
00:34:19,287 --> 00:34:22,588
because we just dragged
the next scene to the trash.

841
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,922
It's gone, sucker.

842
00:34:23,924 --> 00:34:26,392
Seven-plus minutes
of edge-of-your-seat,

843
00:34:26,394 --> 00:34:30,129
marginally animated
bone-throttling action

844
00:34:30,131 --> 00:34:32,365
deleted.
Gone forever. Ha ha ha!

845
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,367
Empty trash, Err.
It's still in there.

846
00:34:34,369 --> 00:34:36,435
Okay.

847
00:34:36,437 --> 00:34:37,669
Gone-a-wrong-a-tong.

848
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:39,671
Oh, do you want to
resume watching

849
00:34:39,673 --> 00:34:42,040
without the crucial information
we destroyed

850
00:34:42,042 --> 00:34:43,708
right in front
of your face?

851
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,178
Dumbass.
You won't understand.

852
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:47,113
You may as well be
watching "Tenet."

853
00:34:47,115 --> 00:34:49,282
You'll have to rent it again
if you can afford it.

854
00:34:49,284 --> 00:34:51,716
Good one, Err.
Implying they're poor.

855
00:34:51,718 --> 00:34:53,084
Impoverish-o.

856
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:54,753
We'll let the movie
continue.

857
00:34:54,755 --> 00:34:56,955
But watch your back.

858
00:35:01,496 --> 00:35:04,829
Damn, man. Them plants chased us
all the way to Berlin,

859
00:35:04,831 --> 00:35:07,300
Reykjavik, and frickin'
Venice, Italy.

860
00:35:07,302 --> 00:35:08,334
But why?

861
00:35:08,336 --> 00:35:10,068
And that key that
the spy gave us,

862
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,238
who we ended up finding dead
in your hotel room.

863
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,906
How does it all connect?
You got to admit, though,

864
00:35:14,908 --> 00:35:17,075
that was
a pretty exciting chase.
Yeah, it was.

865
00:35:17,077 --> 00:35:19,044
Where did those frickin' plants
come from?

866
00:35:19,046 --> 00:35:20,446
Why do you think
I would know?

867
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,548
Frylock's the one who does
the science stuff.

868
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,748
You want me
to text him?

869
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:25,218
He gave you his number?!

870
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:27,253
When I asked,
he gave me the finger.

871
00:35:27,255 --> 00:35:28,621
We're back.

872
00:35:28,623 --> 00:35:30,889
You're welcome.
That's right,
stupid viewer.

873
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:33,526
We deleted
this next scene, too.

874
00:35:33,528 --> 00:35:36,061
Forever.
You'll never see it
'cause it's gone.

875
00:35:36,063 --> 00:35:37,762
It sucked so hard
that I think

876
00:35:37,764 --> 00:35:38,997
we should have
made them watch it.

877
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:41,066
Yes, it is a slow scene.

878
00:35:41,068 --> 00:35:43,034
They take in
some Renaissance art

879
00:35:43,036 --> 00:35:45,003
and fly back home
in real time.

880
00:35:45,005 --> 00:35:47,506
It really added nothing
productive to the story.

881
00:35:47,508 --> 00:35:50,176
Yeah, it's like watching
"The Irishman" on a loop, man.

882
00:35:50,178 --> 00:35:52,245
Well, someone
is a film buff.

883
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:54,113
Got a problem with that?
The onion peels.

884
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:55,615
So what? I like movies.

885
00:35:55,617 --> 00:35:58,551
Well, it's just -- it's just
very hard to disrupt the movie

886
00:35:58,553 --> 00:36:01,187
when you want to
constantly watch it, Err.

887
00:36:01,189 --> 00:36:03,088
You can see how
the optics are bad.
Yeah, I know.

888
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:05,224
We should work together here.
Okay.

889
00:36:05,226 --> 00:36:07,460
Being assholes to the viewer,
not to each other.

890
00:36:07,462 --> 00:36:09,662
I'm not debating you.
Let's just watch the movie.

891
00:36:09,664 --> 00:36:11,062
Press "play."

892
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:12,931
We really need to get out
of here sometime tonight.

893
00:36:12,933 --> 00:36:15,101
Computer,
play the movie.

894
00:36:15,103 --> 00:36:17,403
Moment of truth, Neil.
Ready to do this?

895
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:20,539
Are the ankles gonna perform
like overcooked pasta noodles?

896
00:36:20,541 --> 00:36:22,174
No, because I re-coded
the sequence.

897
00:36:22,176 --> 00:36:24,776
I'm splicing in DNA
from this giraffe

898
00:36:24,778 --> 00:36:27,648
and retired NBA legend
Shawn Kemp.

899
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,216
You're doing what?

900
00:36:29,218 --> 00:36:31,385
You said I was coming up here
to sign autographs for the kids.

901
00:36:33,656 --> 00:36:36,822
Yeah, what she said.
Making him tall sounds so good.

902
00:36:36,824 --> 00:36:39,259
I'm gonna do that.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Make me tall like him.

903
00:36:39,261 --> 00:36:41,361
This will never work, Neil.
I've done the calculations.

904
00:36:41,363 --> 00:36:44,398
And you tried to stretch me
like a balloon animal, Elmer.

905
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,401
Phoenix knows
what he's doing, unlike you.

906
00:36:47,403 --> 00:36:48,735
You ready to do this?

907
00:37:05,387 --> 00:37:08,087
The shinbones are hard.

908
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:10,290
It's working. He's beautiful.

909
00:37:10,292 --> 00:37:12,426
Alright, so,
how do I become this?

910
00:37:12,428 --> 00:37:14,795
It's not how
<i>you</i> become <i>this.</i>

911
00:37:14,797 --> 00:37:16,663
It's how <i>I</i> become <i>you.</i>

912
00:37:16,665 --> 00:37:19,099
Well, you wouldn't be happening
if it wasn't for me.

913
00:37:19,101 --> 00:37:21,702
I'm me.
I'm happening.

914
00:37:24,406 --> 00:37:28,375
Wait, wait, hold up!
You want your autogr-a-a-aph?!

915
00:37:28,377 --> 00:37:30,410
Hold on, now. Hang on there.
You're just a prototype.

916
00:37:30,412 --> 00:37:32,044
You listen to Neil.
He's in charge.

917
00:37:32,046 --> 00:37:34,013
I know. I'm Neil.
I'm in charge.

918
00:37:34,015 --> 00:37:35,816
No, I'm Neil.
I'm in charge.

919
00:37:35,818 --> 00:37:38,218
Make him stop picking me up,
Phoenix, or you're fired.

920
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,221
Help me get him in this box,
Phoenix, or you're fired.

921
00:37:41,223 --> 00:37:42,522
Neil, Neil,
look, I'm sorry.

922
00:37:42,524 --> 00:37:44,324
I didn't think
this was gonna happen, man.

923
00:37:44,326 --> 00:37:45,991
Which Neil
are you talking to?
I'll help you, Neil.

924
00:37:45,993 --> 00:37:47,694
Which Neil
are you talking to?

925
00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:49,129
The bigger one.

926
00:37:49,131 --> 00:37:51,131
Elmer, betrayer!
You Judas!

927
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:54,668
Which Neil were you apologizing
to back there, Phoenix?
Help!

928
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:57,504
Well, you, of course, Big Neil,
obviously.
Please! Anybody!

929
00:37:57,506 --> 00:38:00,039
So should we put some air holes
in that box?
Let me out!

930
00:38:00,041 --> 00:38:01,974
Sure. Put <i>one.</i>

931
00:38:01,976 --> 00:38:04,511
4'2"? Fuck that.

932
00:38:04,513 --> 00:38:09,249
Go to the DMV and change this
to 11-foot-fucking-3.

933
00:38:09,251 --> 00:38:11,284
Neil, I'm so sorry.
Give me some time.

934
00:38:11,286 --> 00:38:12,853
I'll get you out.
Ooh, whoops.
Ow! My eye socket!

935
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:14,053
Sorry about the drill.

936
00:38:14,055 --> 00:38:16,156
Alright,
let's get some shit going.

937
00:38:16,158 --> 00:38:18,458
French fry,
you're my new head of R&D.

938
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,793
But that's my job.

939
00:38:19,795 --> 00:38:24,598
Elmer, you're my new senior VP
in charge of suckling my dong!

940
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,266
But I helped you.
I betrayed my best friend.

941
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:29,703
Get down on it
like a drumstick

942
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:32,037
falling off the bone.

943
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,540
Can I get some kneepads?
I'm a person.

944
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:37,009
Oh, my God. Get off the floor.
Don't mean literally, Elmer.

945
00:38:37,011 --> 00:38:38,512
Oh!
So funny you thought literally.

946
00:38:38,514 --> 00:38:40,814
I was just continuing the joke.
This isn't even a gun.

947
00:38:40,816 --> 00:38:43,683
Hey, uh, sorry, y'all.
I kind of need to take this.

948
00:38:43,685 --> 00:38:45,985
The fuck do you want?!
Hey, did you get my texts?

949
00:38:45,987 --> 00:38:47,421
Yeah, man, I got 'em.

950
00:38:47,423 --> 00:38:49,322
I got a snowman, a flip-flop,
and a stack of pancakes!

951
00:38:49,324 --> 00:38:50,990
Yeah.
They're pretty funny.

952
00:38:50,992 --> 00:38:54,161
Well, I didn't wanna bug ya, but
I did wanna get your attention.

953
00:38:54,163 --> 00:38:56,163
-Tell him you're sick!
-'Cause I'm sick.

954
00:38:56,165 --> 00:38:57,531
Just take an aspirin.
I'm sure you're fine.

955
00:38:57,533 --> 00:38:59,433
You're a damn wad of meat, okay?
Is that all?

956
00:38:59,435 --> 00:39:02,302
That's it. I love you, Frylock.
Have a good one.

957
00:39:02,304 --> 00:39:03,603
Ow! I mean, hold on.

958
00:39:03,605 --> 00:39:05,338
Tell him
you have foot cancer.

959
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:07,441
-I got me foot cancer.
-You ain't got no feet.

960
00:39:07,443 --> 00:39:09,876
Not anymore.
On account of the cancer.

961
00:39:09,878 --> 00:39:11,378
You got tumors.
I got me tumors.

962
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:13,012
Hair loss.
And hair loss.

963
00:39:13,014 --> 00:39:15,248
And, uh, it burns
when you pee. Say that.

964
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,082
What? That's a thing?

965
00:39:17,084 --> 00:39:19,219
Oh, you better believe it.
It's called syphilis.

966
00:39:19,221 --> 00:39:20,654
I have it now.

967
00:39:20,656 --> 00:39:22,523
I got me ensniffilus.

968
00:39:22,525 --> 00:39:24,692
Sniffa-lufagus.
Sniffa-luffalus.

969
00:39:24,694 --> 00:39:27,361
Where you staying?
I'll come to you.

970
00:39:27,363 --> 00:39:28,629
Remember our old crib?

971
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:30,631
I'm next door,
crashing with Carl.

972
00:39:30,633 --> 00:39:32,600
And he pretty fun
when he's sober,

973
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:35,536
but he's a very angry person
when he drinks,

974
00:39:35,538 --> 00:39:38,071
which is most of the time.
Ow! Damn it.

975
00:39:38,073 --> 00:39:40,408
Shake ain't over there,
right? 'Cause you know
I don't want to see him.

976
00:39:40,410 --> 00:39:42,042
<i>If he's there, you</i>
<i>tell him to take a walk, okay?</i>

977
00:39:42,044 --> 00:39:43,311
Well, you tell him
that he sucks it hard!

978
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:44,712
Tell him.
'Cause he does.

979
00:39:44,714 --> 00:39:47,348
Oh, I'll keep Shake's
dumb ass away from ya.

980
00:39:48,384 --> 00:39:50,318
When I tell you
to say something,

981
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:53,387
you repeat it like
the puppet you are!

982
00:39:53,389 --> 00:39:55,156
And did you hang up?
'Cause I don't want him

983
00:39:55,158 --> 00:39:56,591
to hear me abusing you.

984
00:39:56,593 --> 00:39:57,792
Feel my forehead.

985
00:39:57,794 --> 00:39:59,794
Y'all, I think I have
snuffleuffagus.

986
00:39:59,796 --> 00:40:03,331
You need to deal
with something?
Yeah, I'm afraid I do.

987
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:06,701
Look, I may be the same as
teensy-weensy Neil, genetically,

988
00:40:06,703 --> 00:40:08,503
but I'm way taller.
Let me out!

989
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:10,972
Wait. What's he saying?
And I'm way more compassionate.

990
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:12,974
That's not true!
Take my limo, Phoenix.

991
00:40:12,976 --> 00:40:15,075
Aah! Aah!
Man in the box!

992
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:17,077
How do we call
your limo?!

993
00:40:18,882 --> 00:40:21,549
I guess he passed
out. I shook it too hard.

994
00:40:21,551 --> 00:40:24,151
Never mind. That's -- I see
his limo. Thanks. Thanks, Neil.

995
00:40:24,153 --> 00:40:26,854
No, no.
Please call me Big Neil.

996
00:40:26,856 --> 00:40:30,191
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you so much. Big Neil.

997
00:40:30,193 --> 00:40:33,995
He's in an awful hurry. Why?
It's his pathetic friends.

998
00:40:33,997 --> 00:40:36,531
<i>You can't just steal shit</i>
<i>off people's porches, Cup.</i>

999
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:38,933
<i>You got to slink down</i>
<i>like a worm.</i>

1000
00:40:38,935 --> 00:40:41,636
<i>Come at it from the side so</i>
<i>the camera don't get ya.</i>

1001
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:43,838
We pulled this footage off
of some of your amazin'

1002
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:45,206
Ring-Dong
doorbell cameras.

1003
00:40:45,208 --> 00:40:46,574
<i>Another empty one?</i>

1004
00:40:46,576 --> 00:40:48,209
<i>What are these guys</i>
<i>ordering? Oxygen?!</i>

1005
00:40:48,211 --> 00:40:50,678
<i>Lower your voice.</i>
<i>That goes for me, too.</i>

1006
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,078
<i>Or they'll use this</i>
<i>in court.</i>

1007
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,881
He hangs out
with these goons?

1008
00:40:53,883 --> 00:40:56,384
Look at them. Nothing more
than porch pirates.

1009
00:40:56,386 --> 00:40:58,686
And they're about to
become plant food.

1010
00:40:58,688 --> 00:41:01,756
My plan.
I came up with it, not Phoenix.

1011
00:41:01,758 --> 00:41:03,591
Okay, what are you
talking about?

1012
00:41:03,593 --> 00:41:06,193
Fill me in, okay?
I'm obviously new in town.

1013
00:41:06,195 --> 00:41:09,997
Fill him in, Lance.
Lance is my new associate.

1014
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,934
He's still
learning English.

1015
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,571
That was a vowel sound,
I believe.

1016
00:41:16,573 --> 00:41:17,905
Okay, Elmer.

1017
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:20,274
How about <i>you</i> just
give me the broad strokes.

1018
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:22,977
What you looking at?

1019
00:41:22,979 --> 00:41:24,245
Well, it's something,
alright.

1020
00:41:24,247 --> 00:41:25,713
So you don't know
what it is, neither.

1021
00:41:25,715 --> 00:41:29,383
No. Do you? Ahh.
Say no. We're even. Touché.

1022
00:41:29,385 --> 00:41:30,820
I know what it is.

1023
00:41:31,888 --> 00:41:34,855
Never mind. I was bluffing,
trying to act smart.

1024
00:41:34,857 --> 00:41:37,658
I <i>do</i> know what it is,
but I'm not saying it

1025
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:40,328
'cause it would blow
your little minds.

1026
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:44,665
We'll get Frylock in to look at
it to confirm <i>my</i> discovery.

1027
00:41:44,667 --> 00:41:47,501
Ooh, he gonna be pissed
when he sees I ain't sick.

1028
00:41:47,503 --> 00:41:50,404
Just roll around, fake-cough
when he gets here.

1029
00:41:50,406 --> 00:41:52,373
"I'm sick."
It'll work.

1030
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:54,342
That's how I skipped school
all the time.

1031
00:41:54,344 --> 00:41:57,144
But then they put me in a home
for like three years.

1032
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:58,613
I couldn't cough
my way out of that one.

1033
00:41:58,615 --> 00:42:02,416
That won't work on Frylock.
He's a scientist.

1034
00:42:02,418 --> 00:42:06,053
You have to be a little more
sophisticated.

1035
00:42:06,055 --> 00:42:07,622
Now, when Frylock gets here,

1036
00:42:07,624 --> 00:42:09,156
you're gonna throw
this wig around.

1037
00:42:09,158 --> 00:42:10,925
This is your hair loss
from foot cancer.

1038
00:42:10,927 --> 00:42:13,327
Alright, now, look.
Be very careful with this.

1039
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:16,198
I got this off eBay
from Dave Mustaine's barber.

1040
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,433
What is the goal here?

1041
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:22,571
This thing, Aqua Teen.
We're in this for life.

1042
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:27,643
No one just walks away
from Aqua Teen. No one!

1043
00:42:27,645 --> 00:42:30,312
Does this tattoo mean
nothing to you?

1044
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:31,847
"Aqua Teen Forever."

1045
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:33,649
But this here says
"Aqua Teen Never."

1046
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:35,651
Do you want to get
kicked out of Aqua Teen?!

1047
00:42:35,653 --> 00:42:38,754
'Cause I'll do it!
I will blackball your ass!

1048
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:50,901
I'm me. I'm happening.

1049
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:55,437
Get down on it
like a drumstick.

1050
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:58,275
Suckling my dong!

1051
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,043
Keep it running.

1052
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,711
Hello?!

1053
00:43:02,713 --> 00:43:06,048
F-lock! My man!
Gimme a hug, big'un.

1054
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,784
That metal box
is looking tight.

1055
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:09,985
Tight like prom night.

1056
00:43:09,987 --> 00:43:12,354
I still
don't know what that means.

1057
00:43:12,356 --> 00:43:14,456
No wonder you're sick,
hanging out over here.

1058
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:16,291
This place is filled with
asbestos. You know that, right?

1059
00:43:16,293 --> 00:43:19,928
Yeah, I'm --

1060
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,430
I'm --
I'm very sick.

1061
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,732
Hm. 43 degrees.

1062
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:25,634
Well, it's normal
for you.

1063
00:43:25,636 --> 00:43:27,636
Is this spray paint?!
Who painted you white?!

1064
00:43:27,638 --> 00:43:30,173
It was I
who painted him.

1065
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,606
Finally, some credit.

1066
00:43:31,608 --> 00:43:34,509
You're looking well,
Franklin French Frylock.

1067
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,512
The new box looks,
mm, aerodynamic.

1068
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:40,949
It won't get you laid.
Ask some stuff about me now.

1069
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:43,418
Oh, so that's what
this was about, huh?

1070
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:45,721
Getting me over here
to ask some stuff about you.

1071
00:43:45,723 --> 00:43:47,456
'Cause it's always
about you, isn't it?

1072
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,825
No, we worried about you,
Frylock,

1073
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:51,059
working at Amazin'.

1074
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:53,695
That place is bad, man.
Show him the thing.

1075
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:55,630
I know what this is,
"Frylick,"

1076
00:43:55,632 --> 00:43:58,633
and if I wanted your second
opinion, I'd ask for it.

1077
00:43:58,635 --> 00:44:00,435
So what do you think it is?
Not that I'm asking.

1078
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:02,904
Where'd you get all
these boxes? 'Cause
I know you didn't order it.

1079
00:44:02,906 --> 00:44:05,640
I borrowed them
off people's porches!

1080
00:44:05,642 --> 00:44:07,576
But why would your company
be delivering boxes

1081
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,411
to places
where there are no people?

1082
00:44:09,413 --> 00:44:11,947
And usually, there's
cool shit inside the box

1083
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:14,282
and stuff that I can fence
or flip online.

1084
00:44:14,284 --> 00:44:15,650
These was all empty.

1085
00:44:15,652 --> 00:44:17,586
And two of them boxes
turned into plants,

1086
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:19,287
almost killed Shake.

1087
00:44:19,289 --> 00:44:20,889
He's right, dude.
I don't give a shit
what's in those boxes.

1088
00:44:20,891 --> 00:44:22,491
I'm done taking orders
from you, Shake,

1089
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,626
having your ass leech on me,
weigh me down. I'm out!

1090
00:44:24,628 --> 00:44:27,095
Don't you walk out on us without
leaving your phone number.

1091
00:44:27,097 --> 00:44:30,365
Frylock!
I want to block it to make sure
I don't dial it,

1092
00:44:30,367 --> 00:44:32,367
not even accidentally
with my butt.

1093
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:33,568
Back to Amazin', please.

1094
00:44:33,570 --> 00:44:35,403
Hang on, hang on. Hold up.

1095
00:44:35,405 --> 00:44:37,773
This is Dave Mustaine's
actual hair.

1096
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:39,808
I got a certificate
of authenticity.

1097
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:43,812
I need you to clone
him so Megadeth can
live forever, right?

1098
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:45,313
Come on, Fry man!

1099
00:44:45,315 --> 00:44:46,815
I got to budget
for this!

1100
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:48,850
Well, congratulations,
Meatwad.

1101
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,585
You chased him away!

1102
00:44:50,587 --> 00:44:53,355
I vote yes to the union
for guaranteed vacation time

1103
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:58,527
away from you and the rest
of your pork-rind covered race!

1104
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:01,296
I'm voting yes, as well,
so you stupid Japangaloids

1105
00:45:01,298 --> 00:45:03,098
get decent access
to birth control

1106
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:05,934
and stop pumping out your stupid
slime-brained offspring!

1107
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:08,336
Guys, we need to
vote no on the union.

1108
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:09,838
Come on,
let's not rock the boat.

1109
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:11,275
I got a good thing
going here.

1110
00:45:11,277 --> 00:45:12,975
Sleeping in our
shitty Earth cars?

1111
00:45:12,977 --> 00:45:15,611
Suckle more from
the mist pipe, you sheep.

1112
00:45:15,613 --> 00:45:17,013
Get off me!
You slime sheep!

1113
00:45:17,015 --> 00:45:18,248
Let me go!

1114
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:21,151
Good luck voting
with broken bing-bongs, bitch!

1115
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:24,453
I'm afraid
they have the votes, Big Neil.

1116
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:27,124
They can go union.
Ah, but I have the mist.

1117
00:45:27,126 --> 00:45:28,925
You know, I really think

1118
00:45:28,927 --> 00:45:31,327
that using the mist
is not super-woke.

1119
00:45:31,329 --> 00:45:32,762
Right, Other Neil?
What?!

1120
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:35,299
I mean, is it consistent
with our corporate values?

1121
00:45:35,301 --> 00:45:37,900
Yes. Use the mist!
That's why we created it!

1122
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:39,669
I'll consult
with Other Neil

1123
00:45:39,671 --> 00:45:42,872
if I ever decide to
<i>short</i> the stock.

1124
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:44,640
Get it, everyone?

1125
00:45:44,642 --> 00:45:47,144
Right, His Holiness?
He's small?

1126
00:45:47,146 --> 00:45:49,045
Ha! Yeah. Small.

1127
00:45:49,047 --> 00:45:51,480
But the mist is bad.
PR-wise, I mean, right?

1128
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:55,585
I own all the newspapers,
Phoenix, and no one reads them.

1129
00:45:55,587 --> 00:45:57,187
<i>Deploy the mist.</i>

1130
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:03,960
<i>Yep,</i>
<i>It's 4:20 somewhere.</i>

1131
00:46:03,962 --> 00:46:07,630
<i>Attention, Japangaloids</i>
<i>and Fraptackulans.</i>

1132
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,333
<i>You seek a living wage,</i>

1133
00:46:09,335 --> 00:46:11,268
<i>and perhaps you shall have it</i>
<i>in your new job,</i>

1134
00:46:11,270 --> 00:46:12,869
<i>which will not be here</i>

1135
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,905
<i>because you're all fired,</i>
<i>effective immediately.</i>

1136
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:18,841
<i>I don't want to see any</i>
<i>Japangaloid slime or</i>

1137
00:46:18,843 --> 00:46:21,477
<i>Fraptackulan shells</i>
<i>left behind.</i>

1138
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:23,946
<i>Have an amazin' day.</i>
<i>That is all.</i>

1139
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,781
What?!
But who's gonna work the line,

1140
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,783
load the warehouses,
deliver the packages?!

1141
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:30,519
Wait'll you see this shit.
Elmer?

1142
00:46:30,521 --> 00:46:33,489
As part of our
zero-carbon-emission policy,

1143
00:46:33,491 --> 00:46:36,025
all non-critical personnel
will be replaced

1144
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:38,561
by plant-based labor.

1145
00:46:38,563 --> 00:46:40,930
Big Neil's Green New Deal.

1146
00:46:40,932 --> 00:46:42,932
They're all part of one plant,

1147
00:46:42,934 --> 00:46:46,435
all branches of
one photosynthetic vine.

1148
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,704
They don't need
vacations or dental

1149
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:51,275
and they don't give a shit
about what pronoun you use

1150
00:46:51,277 --> 00:46:53,542
when you tell them
what to do.

1151
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:56,012
How are they --
Walking on their own?

1152
00:46:56,014 --> 00:46:58,348
Notice how,
in the nourishing sunlight,

1153
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:01,151
the seeds give off
a blue glint.
Jewel dust.

1154
00:47:01,153 --> 00:47:03,986
My Jewel of Idahocales!
You're synthesizing it!

1155
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,821
And much like
it powers your potatoes,

1156
00:47:05,823 --> 00:47:08,392
it will now power
our workforce.

1157
00:47:08,394 --> 00:47:13,196
Biodegradable packaging
made entirely of seeds.

1158
00:47:13,198 --> 00:47:14,463
Earth first.

1159
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,998
Shake was right.

1160
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,801
Look, buddy, this is for the
good of our planet.

1161
00:47:18,803 --> 00:47:20,703
but it's also
really good for me.

1162
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:21,938
So you had me mugged.

1163
00:47:21,940 --> 00:47:23,373
This was a setup
this whole time!

1164
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,144
If we told you our plan,
you think you would have agreed?

1165
00:47:27,146 --> 00:47:30,713
All those ice baths, dancing
to the beat in the discotheque.

1166
00:47:30,715 --> 00:47:31,981
You didn't feel the vibe at all,
did you?

1167
00:47:31,983 --> 00:47:33,983
I never felt "the vibe."

1168
00:47:33,985 --> 00:47:36,018
You had what I needed,
and I took it from you.

1169
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,521
Now let's unlock this box
and shake hands on this.

1170
00:47:38,523 --> 00:47:40,390
No, we're not
unlocking the box.

1171
00:47:40,392 --> 00:47:43,025
Unlock the box. He needs to see
my face when I say that.

1172
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,561
- Don't unlock the box.
- Come on, man!

1173
00:47:45,563 --> 00:47:46,929
Oh, I'll shake
something, alright.

1174
00:47:46,931 --> 00:47:48,265
But it ain't
gonna be your hand!

1175
00:47:48,267 --> 00:47:50,133
Y'all suck worse
than my last roommates!

1176
00:47:50,135 --> 00:47:52,969
Where you going, Phoenix?
It's Frylock, bitch.

1177
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:54,537
And I'm going to save
my <i>real</i> friends.

1178
00:47:54,539 --> 00:47:56,440
Aqua Teen Forever!

1179
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:22,367
This air-hockey table
sucks.

1180
00:48:22,369 --> 00:48:23,900
Aaaah!
Help!

1181
00:48:23,902 --> 00:48:25,203
You sumbitchin' plants.

1182
00:48:25,205 --> 00:48:27,537
Take your hands
off my Eli bobblehead!

1183
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:29,706
That's a collector's edition!

1184
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:31,608
Let us in! Please!
No!

1185
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,177
I'm a person!
I'm not just a bobblehead!

1186
00:48:33,179 --> 00:48:34,945
You're making them grow
towards me!

1187
00:48:34,947 --> 00:48:37,217
Have some humanity!
Open the door.

1188
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:40,617
-Frylock!
-Frylock!

1189
00:48:40,619 --> 00:48:41,952
Keep that straw
on a swivel, Shake.

1190
00:48:41,954 --> 00:48:44,322
It's time to nip
some plants in the bud.

1191
00:48:44,324 --> 00:48:47,591
Oh, I hate doing yard work!

1192
00:48:47,593 --> 00:48:49,659
That's why you hire people
to do it.

1193
00:49:02,074 --> 00:49:03,774
Just bend over
and pick it up!

1194
00:49:03,776 --> 00:49:05,510
I'm drying it
so it'll move easier, okay?

1195
00:49:05,512 --> 00:49:06,777
And then I'm gonna
chase it down,

1196
00:49:06,779 --> 00:49:09,846
I'm gonna light it on fire!

1197
00:49:09,848 --> 00:49:12,150
There's too many of them!

1198
00:49:21,127 --> 00:49:23,627
Hop in.
If you wanna live.

1199
00:49:23,629 --> 00:49:24,861
Shotgun!

1200
00:49:24,863 --> 00:49:26,431
Unh-unh! Shotgun.
I called it!

1201
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:29,032
-No. I called it first.
-But I was thinking about it,

1202
00:49:29,034 --> 00:49:31,804
and it's been on my mind
for a long time.

1203
00:49:32,539 --> 00:49:34,240
How'd a plant
get a gun?

1204
00:49:35,707 --> 00:49:37,808
Carl, we got to
get above the tree line,

1205
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,310
where the plants won't grow!

1206
00:49:39,312 --> 00:49:42,480
Well, there's only one point
in New Jersey that high --

1207
00:49:42,482 --> 00:49:44,549
Used Babywipe Mountain.

1208
00:49:44,551 --> 00:49:47,187
Oh, anywhere but there!

1209
00:49:49,556 --> 00:49:52,223
This is gonna
result in a massive lawsuit,

1210
00:49:52,225 --> 00:49:54,591
and then I'm gonna
have to pretend to care.

1211
00:49:54,593 --> 00:49:57,761
So I want you to take all of
the pesticide and lawn equipment

1212
00:49:57,763 --> 00:50:00,398
out from the warehouse
and kill yourselves right now.

1213
00:50:04,036 --> 00:50:05,436
I don't know
what to tell you, Neil.

1214
00:50:05,438 --> 00:50:07,105
He's still learning English.

1215
00:50:07,107 --> 00:50:09,840
I don't want to work backward
here, but what if we bring in

1216
00:50:09,842 --> 00:50:11,209
people again?

1217
00:50:11,211 --> 00:50:14,010
Where's Fry-- Phoenix --
Whatever. I need his help.

1218
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:16,746
Why him? I can do
everything he does

1219
00:50:16,748 --> 00:50:18,682
except for float
and the eye lasers.

1220
00:50:18,684 --> 00:50:19,883
And also, he's a little
smarter than me.

1221
00:50:19,885 --> 00:50:21,084
And he's made of potatoes.

1222
00:50:21,086 --> 00:50:22,520
But other than that,
we're the same.

1223
00:50:22,522 --> 00:50:26,990
No. Frylock still works here.
But Elmer is fired.

1224
00:50:26,992 --> 00:50:32,263
Fine. It's time for me
to <i>branch out</i> anyway...

1225
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:34,798
<i>weed out</i> some problems
I'm having...

1226
00:50:37,237 --> 00:50:41,838
...turn over a new <i>leaf,</i>
as it were.

1227
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,674
Elmer, get off the ground,
ya dork. You look stupid.

1228
00:50:44,676 --> 00:50:46,810
Please call me Elm.

1229
00:50:46,812 --> 00:50:53,584
The Elmanator.
Your botanical nightmare!

1230
00:50:53,586 --> 00:50:56,120
Who's tall <i>now,</i> Neil?

1231
00:50:56,122 --> 00:50:57,787
I want you out of the building.

1232
00:50:57,789 --> 00:50:59,357
Security!

1233
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:01,659
And, of course,
you're plants, too.

1234
00:51:01,661 --> 00:51:04,996
A judgy vegan stands
before you.

1235
00:51:04,998 --> 00:51:07,698
He subsists
on your brethren.

1236
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,035
Seize him
and eat him raw.

1237
00:51:11,037 --> 00:51:15,174
I'm only running away
because I have to pee so bad.

1238
00:51:20,414 --> 00:51:22,847
See? What'd I tell you?
It is a spaceship.

1239
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:24,715
I was the one
that told you about this.

1240
00:51:24,717 --> 00:51:26,618
Why does nobody
listen to me?

1241
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:28,187
Ugh!
Ow!

1242
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:32,089
May the forest
be with you.

1243
00:51:36,297 --> 00:51:39,764
Hey, y'all. Look what I got
at the gift shop.

1244
00:51:39,766 --> 00:51:42,634
There's no gift shop here. You
stole that from the mountain.

1245
00:51:42,636 --> 00:51:46,171
You know, I'm glad they finally
made this a national monument.

1246
00:51:46,173 --> 00:51:49,408
Come try to knock this down,
Muslim extremists!

1247
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:50,708
See what you get!

1248
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:53,111
"I cannot
in good con-science..."
Conscience.

1249
00:51:53,113 --> 00:51:55,547
"...continue to work
for a monster."

1250
00:51:55,549 --> 00:51:56,881
This is your big plan?!

1251
00:51:56,883 --> 00:51:58,816
No, I'm texting
my resignation letter.

1252
00:51:58,818 --> 00:52:01,320
I told you Amazin' was bad.
Didn't I say that?

1253
00:52:01,322 --> 00:52:04,055
And I said something
was weird about the boxes.

1254
00:52:04,057 --> 00:52:05,290
And I was right,
wasn't I?

1255
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:06,857
You're right
one time in 20 years,

1256
00:52:06,859 --> 00:52:08,427
and you think you invented
being right.

1257
00:52:08,429 --> 00:52:11,430
And who came to the rescue?
Not you, Frylock.

1258
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:12,664
No, no!

1259
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:15,066
It was Carl, the greaseball

1260
00:52:15,068 --> 00:52:17,536
marinara-stain cafone
from next door.

1261
00:52:17,538 --> 00:52:20,071
Hey!
The ubatz gabagool.

1262
00:52:20,073 --> 00:52:22,341
I'm a proud half-Italian.
I'm not gonna stand here

1263
00:52:22,343 --> 00:52:24,142
and allow you
to screw up that slur.

1264
00:52:24,144 --> 00:52:26,811
Mamma mia.
Italians...

1265
00:52:26,813 --> 00:52:29,013
You can't end a sentence
with "gabagool"!

1266
00:52:29,015 --> 00:52:30,848
It's grammatically
incorrect!

1267
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,451
Break it up, y'all.
Break it up.

1268
00:52:32,453 --> 00:52:34,785
We got to work together
so Frylock

1269
00:52:34,787 --> 00:52:37,222
can figure out
how Frylock's gonna solve

1270
00:52:37,224 --> 00:52:40,292
this mess that Frylock
also got us into.

1271
00:52:40,294 --> 00:52:42,194
You admit that at least,
right, Frylock?

1272
00:52:42,196 --> 00:52:44,630
Everybody just shut up
so I can think!

1273
00:52:44,632 --> 00:52:48,233
Well, since he obviously
didn't have an exit strategy,

1274
00:52:48,235 --> 00:52:51,169
I guess I'm gonna
have to roll out <i>my</i> plan.

1275
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:55,207
Operation Master Shake and Bake.

1276
00:52:56,377 --> 00:52:58,543
Blueprints of the Pentagon,
gentlemen.

1277
00:52:58,545 --> 00:53:03,047
The basement houses over 30 tons
of thermite plasma,

1278
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:06,485
according to a pretty accurate
movie trailer I saw.

1279
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:09,154
We transport it over here
to this Air Force base, which --

1280
00:53:09,156 --> 00:53:11,423
There's got to be one, right?

1281
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:13,625
And karate our ways
past the guards.

1282
00:53:13,627 --> 00:53:15,893
See, this is me with the laser.
I'm driving a monster truck.

1283
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:19,096
Now, in all likelihood, we will
not have the monster truck

1284
00:53:19,098 --> 00:53:20,499
for this particular operation.

1285
00:53:20,501 --> 00:53:23,135
But after that,
we hijack a C-130.

1286
00:53:23,137 --> 00:53:25,604
They call it the <i>Fat Albert.</i>

1287
00:53:25,606 --> 00:53:27,606
Hey, hey, hey!

1288
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:29,940
And what are you gonna blow up
with all that thermite plasma
that doesn't even exist?

1289
00:53:29,942 --> 00:53:32,344
The Garden State, bitch.
Kaboom!

1290
00:53:32,346 --> 00:53:34,812
And Newark is a sheet of glass.

1291
00:53:34,814 --> 00:53:36,481
-I have a plan.
-Oh, God.

1292
00:53:36,483 --> 00:53:39,151
Oh, this should be good.
Someone make popcorn.

1293
00:53:39,153 --> 00:53:41,952
Bugs --
they like to eat plants,

1294
00:53:41,954 --> 00:53:43,789
especially when
I tell them to.

1295
00:53:43,791 --> 00:53:45,089
His plan sucks.

1296
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:47,125
It's over. We're done.
Calm down, Carl.

1297
00:53:47,127 --> 00:53:49,294
I'm supposed to make
a mint on that house,

1298
00:53:49,296 --> 00:53:52,531
and now I can't even freakin'
see it under all the kudzu!

1299
00:53:52,533 --> 00:53:54,933
Just laser them
with your eyes or what --

1300
00:53:54,935 --> 00:53:57,102
What's up with
all the plans?

1301
00:53:57,104 --> 00:53:59,037
Because you ain't
got a plan, do ya?

1302
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:00,606
Do ya?!
There is no plan!

1303
00:54:00,608 --> 00:54:02,675
Ohh! Look out!

1304
00:54:08,882 --> 00:54:10,283
How's that for a landing?

1305
00:54:10,285 --> 00:54:11,850
I'm getting the hang
of this bitch.

1306
00:54:11,852 --> 00:54:13,519
How did you find me?

1307
00:54:13,521 --> 00:54:17,156
Well, I triangulated the signal
from your resignation text.

1308
00:54:17,158 --> 00:54:19,459
You agreed to accept cookies,
not me.

1309
00:54:19,461 --> 00:54:20,992
We're done, Neil.
Both Neils.

1310
00:54:20,994 --> 00:54:22,228
Oh, whoa, whoa, wait.

1311
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,698
Little Neil and I
are very sorry,

1312
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:27,300
and we love you very much.

1313
00:54:27,302 --> 00:54:29,202
Yeah,
I'm Sorry about earlier.

1314
00:54:29,204 --> 00:54:30,770
I'm feeling the vibe again.

1315
00:54:30,772 --> 00:54:34,674
Uh, so, look, we need you
to stop these plants.

1316
00:54:34,676 --> 00:54:37,310
You know how when you talk to
plants and it helps them grow?

1317
00:54:37,312 --> 00:54:40,446
What if we, like,
talk angry shit at them?

1318
00:54:40,448 --> 00:54:42,382
Like, "You fat, lazy, bald
piece of shit.

1319
00:54:42,384 --> 00:54:44,317
You'll never amount
to nothing!"

1320
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:46,185
And then they, you know,
go cry in their room

1321
00:54:46,187 --> 00:54:48,121
with a lower self-esteem.

1322
00:54:48,123 --> 00:54:50,623
I'm just saying, that
worked on me, and, you know...

1323
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:53,559
We have no plan.

1324
00:54:59,401 --> 00:55:02,968
Wait. Sunlight! Don't
plants need sunlight to survive?

1325
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:06,172
How are you going to turn off
the sun, dumbass? Great plan!

1326
00:55:06,174 --> 00:55:07,673
No, no, no. He's right.

1327
00:55:07,675 --> 00:55:10,743
The -- The -- The slimy weirdo
in the parking lot.

1328
00:55:10,745 --> 00:55:12,578
She said Neil used the ship

1329
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:15,080
to push their planet
towards the sun.

1330
00:55:15,082 --> 00:55:18,751
-That's right.
-Then we can use Neil's ship

1331
00:55:18,753 --> 00:55:20,686
to block out the sun...

1332
00:55:20,688 --> 00:55:22,555
with the moon.

1333
00:55:22,557 --> 00:55:25,358
That would work?
Cool! Okay.

1334
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:28,161
So, before we all go up there
in Neil's ship,

1335
00:55:28,163 --> 00:55:30,129
I got to tell you, I hope
this dinner's not going to be

1336
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:31,798
some of that freeze-dried
astro crap.

1337
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,566
Shake, Shake, Shake,
we need you down here, man,

1338
00:55:33,568 --> 00:55:34,600
to protect the Earth.

1339
00:55:34,602 --> 00:55:36,469
You were always
the bravest, man.

1340
00:55:36,471 --> 00:55:38,671
The strongest --
-Uh, you forgot smartest.

1341
00:55:38,673 --> 00:55:41,240
I said you forgot smartest.
Say that one now.

1342
00:55:41,242 --> 00:55:42,875
Carl, Meatwad,
you stay here, too.

1343
00:55:42,877 --> 00:55:44,577
Oh. Whoa, hold up, Buck Rogers.

1344
00:55:44,579 --> 00:55:47,146
What do we do while you're
farting around in space?

1345
00:55:47,148 --> 00:55:48,980
Yeah, man, we just got back
together.

1346
00:55:48,982 --> 00:55:50,616
And I'll be back soon,
Meatwad.

1347
00:55:50,618 --> 00:55:53,553
And when I come back, it'll be
Aqua Teen Forever and Ever.

1348
00:55:53,555 --> 00:55:57,890
Alright. But before you go,
I made you a new box

1349
00:55:57,892 --> 00:56:01,861
out of the only box
that didn't turn into a plant.

1350
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:03,529
My best friend.

1351
00:56:03,531 --> 00:56:04,864
Boxy Brown.

1352
00:56:04,866 --> 00:56:07,934
'Cause once you go Brown,
you're going downtown.

1353
00:56:07,936 --> 00:56:09,602
Down to clown.

1354
00:56:09,604 --> 00:56:11,804
You sound different, Boxy.
I'm New Boxy.

1355
00:56:11,806 --> 00:56:15,408
Old Boxy got canceled, 'cause
Boxy Brown is BIPOC, fool.

1356
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:18,911
Oh, I don't see color, Boxy.
You're just a box.

1357
00:56:18,913 --> 00:56:20,513
I'm just a what?! Bitch!

1358
00:56:20,515 --> 00:56:22,348
See ya!
Oh, no. Is he leaving?

1359
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:23,816
He don't want the box?

1360
00:56:23,818 --> 00:56:25,487
Aah!
Boxy, no!

1361
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:30,289
Well, I, for one,
ain't going to die

1362
00:56:30,291 --> 00:56:32,258
on no pile of used baby wipes,

1363
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,926
getting macked on
by a bunch of shrubbery.

1364
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:37,497
And I ain't gonna let America
get pussified, not on my watch.

1365
00:56:37,499 --> 00:56:38,898
Yeah!

1366
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,201
Nowadays, you get in trouble
just because you stare and point

1367
00:56:42,203 --> 00:56:44,370
at certain parts
of a babe's body and go,

1368
00:56:44,372 --> 00:56:47,072
"Oh, yeah!"
Oh, she'll complain.

1369
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:49,208
But deep down,
you know she loves it.

1370
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,844
Don't grow big boobs,
lady!

1371
00:56:50,846 --> 00:56:52,212
Where is this going,
Carl?

1372
00:56:52,214 --> 00:56:53,814
I think you're losing
the thread.

1373
00:56:53,816 --> 00:56:57,451
I'm saying this country is
in desperate need of a real man.

1374
00:56:57,453 --> 00:57:01,955
A badass. A, yes, toxic,
masculine man like me.

1375
00:57:01,957 --> 00:57:03,156
Damn straight!

1376
00:57:03,158 --> 00:57:04,658
And this man
don't let a bunch of

1377
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:08,228
Christmas trees and mistletoe
tell him what to do.

1378
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:09,696
I'm about to roll down there

1379
00:57:09,698 --> 00:57:13,233
and stomp all them shrubs
under my V24 turbocharged

1380
00:57:13,235 --> 00:57:15,034
carbon footprint.

1381
00:57:15,036 --> 00:57:16,870
Who's with me?
Yeah! I'm in!

1382
00:57:16,872 --> 00:57:18,505
Let's do this.
Yeah!

1383
00:57:18,507 --> 00:57:20,974
Oh, gross. Now my hands
are gonna stink.

1384
00:57:20,976 --> 00:57:22,676
Tonight!

1385
00:57:24,813 --> 00:57:26,847
One!

1386
00:57:26,849 --> 00:57:33,620
Hot dog. Igloo. Hot dog. Igloo.
Hot dog. Igloo.

1387
00:57:35,224 --> 00:57:36,790
Oh, I'm sorry.
Guess who!

1388
00:57:36,792 --> 00:57:40,327
Did we interrupt your movie
at a pivotal juncture?

1389
00:57:40,329 --> 00:57:42,729
Listen up!
Don't you walk
to the bathroom on me.

1390
00:57:42,731 --> 00:57:46,833
Get back here and sit your two
ample buttocks right down.

1391
00:57:46,835 --> 00:57:48,569
Yeah, man. We're going to
fast-forward and reverse

1392
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:50,037
and fast-forward and reverse
and fast--

1393
00:57:52,308 --> 00:57:53,774
That's right. He will.
Oh, damn it.

1394
00:57:53,776 --> 00:57:56,443
He's a madman
and he's coked to the gills.

1395
00:57:56,445 --> 00:57:57,945
Yeah! I got nowhere to go

1396
00:57:57,947 --> 00:58:00,147
except the liquor store
before it closes.

1397
00:58:00,149 --> 00:58:01,882
Liquor is our guide.
Big-time!

1398
00:58:01,884 --> 00:58:05,485
And if you want us to stop
ruining this shambling mess

1399
00:58:05,487 --> 00:58:07,020
that you call entertainment...

1400
00:58:07,022 --> 00:58:08,689
Text us your
girlfriend's digits.

1401
00:58:08,691 --> 00:58:12,125
Or we shall ruin the entire
third act with our anger.

1402
00:58:12,127 --> 00:58:13,427
Data charges
will apply.

1403
00:58:13,429 --> 00:58:16,229
Your girl looks like a 4.
That's a digit.

1404
00:58:16,231 --> 00:58:17,831
That's right --
I'm negging her.

1405
00:58:17,833 --> 00:58:20,067
Any girl that looks at me
is a fucking 10, man.

1406
00:58:20,069 --> 00:58:21,468
How many texts, Err?

1407
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:23,604
Um, none.
My phone's dead.

1408
00:58:23,606 --> 00:58:26,406
You will hang on while
we charge his phone.

1409
00:58:26,408 --> 00:58:31,411
Don't text yet. Save your text,
then text it. We'll be back.

1410
00:58:31,413 --> 00:58:34,214
Quickly.
You know we will.

1411
00:58:34,216 --> 00:58:36,550
Always keep your phone
charging, Err.

1412
00:58:36,552 --> 00:58:37,818
I know.

1413
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,820
You could have had it plugged
in during my entire rant.

1414
00:58:39,822 --> 00:58:41,321
Okay, okay, okay, Dad.

1415
00:58:43,892 --> 00:58:45,425
There we go.

1416
00:58:45,427 --> 00:58:47,961
Fossil fuel, baby.

1417
00:58:47,963 --> 00:58:49,396
Unrenewable energy!

1418
00:58:49,398 --> 00:58:50,897
The hair looks good, Carl.

1419
00:58:50,899 --> 00:58:52,265
I wish I had enough up top

1420
00:58:52,267 --> 00:58:54,501
to do, like,
the true Road Warrior mohawk.

1421
00:58:54,503 --> 00:58:56,536
But I think the side hawks
are working.

1422
00:58:56,538 --> 00:58:58,705
Friggin' purple.
Mm. So silver.

1423
00:58:58,707 --> 00:59:00,674
Where'd y'all get
all this cool stuff?

1424
00:59:00,676 --> 00:59:02,609
All I got me was some
bubble wrap.

1425
00:59:02,611 --> 00:59:04,711
And I popped most of it.
It's fun. Listen.

1426
00:59:05,814 --> 00:59:10,450
Mmm! Mmm!
Engorge yourself, my seedlings.

1427
00:59:10,452 --> 00:59:13,720
You must grow
strong and powerful.

1428
00:59:13,722 --> 00:59:17,257
Feasting on their shit,
which is our food.

1429
00:59:17,259 --> 00:59:22,195
Rise and reclaim the planet!

1430
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:27,267
Can you not steer
better than this?

1431
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:29,137
Come on, man!
I'm about to hurl over here!

1432
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:30,604
These are the controls.

1433
00:59:30,606 --> 00:59:32,973
I don't even know how
I'm supposed to wear this.

1434
00:59:32,975 --> 00:59:36,410
It's a tuxedo,
specifically fitted to my body.

1435
00:59:36,412 --> 00:59:38,545
Only I can pilot the ship.

1436
00:59:38,547 --> 00:59:40,514
Not from inside a box
you won't.

1437
00:59:40,516 --> 00:59:41,915
Brace for impact!

1438
00:59:45,288 --> 00:59:47,588
-Pay attention, Earth fools.
-Yeah!

1439
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:50,725
Because this is when
the movie finally gets good.

1440
00:59:50,727 --> 00:59:52,460
This is the scene where we start
kicking their asses

1441
00:59:52,462 --> 00:59:54,262
for seven duets and I turn into
this giant penis.

1442
00:59:54,264 --> 00:59:56,030
Err, no spoilers, please.

1443
00:59:56,032 --> 00:59:58,199
-I see dead people!
-The viewers have eyeballs.

1444
00:59:58,201 --> 01:00:02,336
They can witness the
blood-soaked carnage
on their own.

1445
01:00:02,338 --> 01:00:05,975
Bathe in the blood
of your bitch master!

1446
01:00:09,679 --> 01:00:12,680
You don't, by any chance,
know how to --

1447
01:00:12,682 --> 01:00:15,683
How to push the moon
in front of the sun? Hell, no.

1448
01:00:15,685 --> 01:00:18,519
Shoot.
Oh. Maybe I do!

1449
01:00:18,521 --> 01:00:19,787
No, it turns out,
I don't.

1450
01:00:19,789 --> 01:00:21,856
Let me out of the box!

1451
01:00:21,858 --> 01:00:24,225
I'm the only one
who can operate the <i>Llama!</i>

1452
01:00:24,227 --> 01:00:25,760
I'm a billionaire!

1453
01:00:25,762 --> 01:00:27,528
What do you think I was doing
what I was supposed to be

1454
01:00:27,530 --> 01:00:28,730
on Earth paying taxes?

1455
01:00:28,732 --> 01:00:30,132
Shit. The controls
are jammed.

1456
01:00:30,134 --> 01:00:31,799
<i>Aloha, bitch!</i>

1457
01:00:36,473 --> 01:00:38,673
Behold the Mechanites!

1458
01:00:38,675 --> 01:00:40,875
-You are very impressed.
-Check it out.

1459
01:00:40,877 --> 01:00:42,744
Solid gold.
Polished.

1460
01:00:42,746 --> 01:00:44,679
God damn. The Mooninites.

1461
01:00:44,681 --> 01:00:47,648
And don't you dare push us.

1462
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:49,817
Because we have no stability
front to back.

1463
01:00:49,819 --> 01:00:51,619
'Cause we --
we would fall over.

1464
01:00:51,621 --> 01:00:54,489
Come on. Help me into this
thing. I'm gonna destroy those

1465
01:00:54,491 --> 01:00:56,191
little motherfuckin' Mooninites
once and for all.

1466
01:00:56,193 --> 01:00:58,059
<i>The speaker</i>
<i>is still on</i>

1467
01:00:58,061 --> 01:01:00,728
<i>where you called us</i>
<i>the fucking Mooninites.</i>

1468
01:01:00,730 --> 01:01:03,165
<i>Come on, bitch!</i>

1469
01:01:06,936 --> 01:01:09,204
Let him out! He's the only one
who could fit into the suit.

1470
01:01:09,206 --> 01:01:10,438
No, he's going to
be pissed.

1471
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,006
Yeah, he's going to be
more pissed

1472
01:01:12,008 --> 01:01:13,608
when the Mechanite kills us all.
Where's the damn air lock?

1473
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:15,110
I need to go out there
and fight them myself.

1474
01:01:15,112 --> 01:01:17,044
Uh,
you might want to wait on that.

1475
01:01:17,046 --> 01:01:20,215
Well, my box is brotanium,
the lightest yet strongest metal

1476
01:01:20,217 --> 01:01:21,749
outside of the MCU, right?

1477
01:01:21,751 --> 01:01:25,220
Uh, we lied.
It's aluminum foil.

1478
01:01:25,222 --> 01:01:26,654
Damn it! I knew it!
Sorry.

1479
01:01:26,656 --> 01:01:28,890
That's why I sound like thunder
when I sit down.

1480
01:01:37,901 --> 01:01:39,634
You stay
right where you are.

1481
01:01:39,636 --> 01:01:41,102
Ooh, it's gonna hurt!

1482
01:01:41,104 --> 01:01:43,504
Let me out.
Only I can help us now.

1483
01:01:43,506 --> 01:01:48,243
The bullet should be reaching
its final destination ASAP.

1484
01:01:56,820 --> 01:01:59,720
Time for me to...hit the hay!

1485
01:01:59,722 --> 01:02:01,389
Screw you, environment!

1486
01:02:01,391 --> 01:02:05,026
Looks like we got us
a real bumper crop this season!

1487
01:02:05,028 --> 01:02:07,528
You about to be
pushing daisies, plant!

1488
01:02:07,530 --> 01:02:10,565
Let's kick this grass
in the ass. Heh-heh.

1489
01:02:10,567 --> 01:02:13,034
Time to nip your ass
in the bud.

1490
01:02:13,036 --> 01:02:15,036
If a tree falls in the woods,

1491
01:02:15,038 --> 01:02:18,806
but everyone is --
they <i>are</i> around to hear it,

1492
01:02:18,808 --> 01:02:21,375
then it will make a sound,

1493
01:02:21,377 --> 01:02:23,077
like you just did
as I killed you.

1494
01:02:23,079 --> 01:02:24,712
Kind of a long way
to go for that one.

1495
01:02:24,714 --> 01:02:26,547
What, yours were
so much better?

1496
01:02:30,187 --> 01:02:32,653
Shit. Should've paid
for all-wheel drive.

1497
01:02:32,655 --> 01:02:34,989
But I had to have
the subwoofer.

1498
01:02:36,193 --> 01:02:38,359
Ohh!
We're all out!

1499
01:02:38,361 --> 01:02:42,198
Get off my lawn!

1500
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,499
Oh, what the hell
is that?

1501
01:02:44,501 --> 01:02:47,303
I see we have
a little turf war.

1502
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:49,972
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!

1503
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,573
Aw, come on.

1504
01:02:51,575 --> 01:02:52,841
I got one bubble left, y'all.

1505
01:02:52,843 --> 01:02:54,409
Get behind me.
Cover your ears.

1506
01:02:54,411 --> 01:02:56,312
Did that do anything?

1507
01:02:56,314 --> 01:02:58,147
-Nothing.
-Well, we tried.

1508
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:01,884
Mmm!
Fresh greenhouse gases!

1509
01:03:01,886 --> 01:03:06,655
There's a new world order
taking root.

1510
01:03:08,492 --> 01:03:09,691
Meat man, reach under the seat.

1511
01:03:11,095 --> 01:03:12,628
Peach schnapps?
Crème de menthe?

1512
01:03:12,630 --> 01:03:14,529
Yeah, you ain't gotta
announce it. Okay?

1513
01:03:14,531 --> 01:03:16,498
I pound this in the strip-club
parking lot

1514
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:18,268
so I can save my cash
for the lap dances.

1515
01:03:18,270 --> 01:03:20,602
So are we getting wasted,
or what's the plan?

1516
01:03:20,604 --> 01:03:22,471
My cousin taught me this.

1517
01:03:22,473 --> 01:03:24,506
It's how you start
an electrical fire

1518
01:03:24,508 --> 01:03:26,708
when you know
they got good insurance.

1519
01:03:26,710 --> 01:03:29,511
Everything's coming up
for roses for Elmer.

1520
01:03:29,513 --> 01:03:33,383
And he's about to be a...
thorn in your side.

1521
01:03:33,385 --> 01:03:36,084
Have a drink on me, bitch!

1522
01:03:37,087 --> 01:03:39,788
Yeah!
It's happy hour, bee-yotch!

1523
01:03:39,790 --> 01:03:42,225
-Aaah!
-Look. Two for one.

1524
01:03:42,227 --> 01:03:45,460
Ladies' night, stupid.
You ever been in a bar?

1525
01:03:45,462 --> 01:03:47,163
♪ Have a drink on me ♪

1526
01:03:47,165 --> 01:03:50,065
This really burns me up!

1527
01:03:52,137 --> 01:03:56,306
I guess I'm a late bloomer.

1528
01:03:56,308 --> 01:03:58,941
Prepare to be planted.

1529
01:03:58,943 --> 01:04:02,911
Six feet under,
if you know what I mean!

1530
01:04:02,913 --> 01:04:05,248
This is it.
We're going down.

1531
01:04:05,250 --> 01:04:06,949
I love you,
Master Shake.

1532
01:04:06,951 --> 01:04:08,784
I know you do.
I hear that a lot.

1533
01:04:08,786 --> 01:04:10,719
Lots of people
are saying it,

1534
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:13,289
and you're pretty cool, too,
sometimes,

1535
01:04:13,291 --> 01:04:15,557
but don't get
a big head about it.

1536
01:04:15,559 --> 01:04:18,328
Aqua Teen Forever, y'all.

1537
01:04:18,330 --> 01:04:21,964
Plants!
Destroy them!

1538
01:04:26,503 --> 01:04:28,804
-Whoo-hoo!
-Whoo-hoo!

1539
01:04:28,806 --> 01:04:31,374
It's the Japangaloids
and the Fraptackulans!

1540
01:04:31,376 --> 01:04:33,109
They're here to save us!

1541
01:04:33,111 --> 01:04:34,943
Can still see the sun!

1542
01:04:34,945 --> 01:04:37,679
Frylock!
We need you, man!

1543
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:39,449
Mechanite,
chug mightily

1544
01:04:39,451 --> 01:04:42,084
from the tall boy
of destiny.
Drink it!

1545
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:45,620
So that you may shower
the defeated.

1546
01:04:45,622 --> 01:04:47,622
Unleash the flow!

1547
01:04:47,624 --> 01:04:51,394
Feel the heat
of our digital whiz.

1548
01:04:51,396 --> 01:04:52,894
Before I open this box,

1549
01:04:52,896 --> 01:04:55,530
I want you to know
I'm very sorry,

1550
01:04:55,532 --> 01:04:57,933
but I need you
to stay calm.

1551
01:04:57,935 --> 01:05:00,271
No, no, no, no.
We'll have none of that.

1552
01:05:02,706 --> 01:05:06,275
Get me fitted.
Into my tuxedo.

1553
01:05:12,683 --> 01:05:15,050
That's right.
Whoa!

1554
01:05:15,052 --> 01:05:17,286
Abort! Abort!

1555
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:20,856
Err, the whiz,
it's splashing back on us.

1556
01:05:20,858 --> 01:05:23,159
'Cause we need more beer, dude,
so we can, like, pee harder.

1557
01:05:23,161 --> 01:05:26,496
Or it could be the lack of
gravity on the moon, but...

1558
01:05:26,498 --> 01:05:27,863
probably not.

1559
01:05:27,865 --> 01:05:29,165
We'll go with your idea.

1560
01:05:29,167 --> 01:05:32,502
Mechanite, re-commence
the drinking!

1561
01:05:32,504 --> 01:05:34,771
Press the stop button!

1562
01:05:34,773 --> 01:05:37,307
Aah!
Stop it, stop it!

1563
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:46,049
Time to play with dollies.
<i>Llama Dollies.</i>

1564
01:05:48,586 --> 01:05:51,988
Put a kink in it, Err.
The dog wants more.

1565
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,857
Let doggy combat begin!

1566
01:05:54,859 --> 01:05:57,494
Here, doggy, doggy.
Come here, bitch.

1567
01:06:00,266 --> 01:06:02,466
You wanna try that again?
Blockonomica.

1568
01:06:02,468 --> 01:06:05,835
Bitch, heel, sit.
Ha ha!

1569
01:06:05,837 --> 01:06:08,738
Unleash the slightly faster
bullets, Err.

1570
01:06:08,740 --> 01:06:10,940
The heat-seeking banshees.

1571
01:06:10,942 --> 01:06:15,446
Alright, let's see what you got,
you 8-bit piece of shit.

1572
01:06:15,448 --> 01:06:17,747
The onslaught begins!

1573
01:06:17,749 --> 01:06:19,715
Kabang, kapow, kablooey!

1574
01:06:19,717 --> 01:06:22,718
It's a bullet buffet.
All you can eat.

1575
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,855
Find my center.
Hammmmm...

1576
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:28,192
Take it.
You love it!

1577
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:30,660
Hammmmm...

1578
01:06:34,065 --> 01:06:35,199
And four.

1579
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:37,201
Don't aim
the bullets straight ahead.

1580
01:06:37,203 --> 01:06:38,202
He avoided them!

1581
01:06:38,204 --> 01:06:40,304
He's jumping.
We can handle jumping.

1582
01:06:40,306 --> 01:06:42,738
Greased hammmm...

1583
01:06:43,942 --> 01:06:46,210
Impressive,
but stand by

1584
01:06:46,212 --> 01:06:49,580
for a massive blast
from our metal ass.

1585
01:06:49,582 --> 01:06:50,880
You're doing down, homey.

1586
01:06:50,882 --> 01:06:53,816
It takes a minute,
but it's so worth it.

1587
01:06:59,757 --> 01:07:01,958
The bullet is enormous!
Bullets for dinner.

1588
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,229
It has its own theme song.
Prepare for death.

1589
01:07:05,231 --> 01:07:06,729
Jumping is useless!

1590
01:07:06,731 --> 01:07:08,599
Hammmmm!

1591
01:07:08,601 --> 01:07:09,866
Jumping wasn't useless.

1592
01:07:09,868 --> 01:07:11,301
He's behind us.
Oh, no!

1593
01:07:11,303 --> 01:07:14,304
And he knows we have
no frontward-to-back stability.

1594
01:07:14,306 --> 01:07:15,938
Hey, don't push us, man.
We warned you.

1595
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:18,242
Don't tell him, Err.
Aah!

1596
01:07:18,244 --> 01:07:19,709
Damn it.

1597
01:07:19,711 --> 01:07:21,245
Okay, this isn't
very interesting.

1598
01:07:21,247 --> 01:07:22,912
Yeah, this part
isn't any good.

1599
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:25,182
So, uh, we'll fast-forward
through this boring part

1600
01:07:25,184 --> 01:07:27,317
so you don't have to
suffer through it.

1601
01:07:27,319 --> 01:07:28,885
We're doing you a favor.

1602
01:07:28,887 --> 01:07:30,487
Because we care
about you.

1603
01:07:30,489 --> 01:07:32,755
Favoronomica.

1604
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,658
Time to redecorate space.

1605
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:44,066
Glad you opened the box now?

1606
01:07:47,406 --> 01:07:49,038
N-o-o-o-o-o!

1607
01:07:49,040 --> 01:07:50,940
Look, y'all!
Frylock did it!

1608
01:07:50,942 --> 01:07:52,875
Yeah, Frylock!

1609
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:57,581
Nourishing sunlight!

1610
01:07:57,583 --> 01:07:59,815
Life-force draining!

1611
01:07:59,817 --> 01:08:03,387
Man, I love to see
the leaves change in the fall.

1612
01:08:03,389 --> 01:08:06,192
Aaaaaah!

1613
01:08:08,227 --> 01:08:11,060
My frigging car! You couldn't
have pushed it over there

1614
01:08:11,062 --> 01:08:13,062
by that burned-out
Jamba Juice?

1615
01:08:13,064 --> 01:08:15,865
Frylock!
He finally came through

1616
01:08:15,867 --> 01:08:19,936
for once in his
pathetic existence!

1617
01:08:19,938 --> 01:08:22,071
Ooh. It's getting kinda cold,
ain't it?

1618
01:08:22,073 --> 01:08:25,209
Yeah. M-M-Maybe
not a flip-flop day.

1619
01:08:25,211 --> 01:08:28,010
Damn it, Frylock!
You screwed us again!

1620
01:08:28,012 --> 01:08:30,948
You were telling Elmer
to dump me in the river!

1621
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:33,484
"Toss him off
the GW Bridge, Elmer."

1622
01:08:33,486 --> 01:08:35,919
I heard every word.
That's not who I am.

1623
01:08:35,921 --> 01:08:38,623
You know me, Neil.
I'm you.

1624
01:08:38,625 --> 01:08:41,459
And together we can join forces
and build a better company.

1625
01:08:41,461 --> 01:08:44,928
No, no, no, no, no. Too much
water under the bridge...

1626
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:46,897
that you would have
thrown me off of!

1627
01:08:46,899 --> 01:08:49,300
What am I talking about?

1628
01:08:49,302 --> 01:08:51,302
Come on.
Let's give it a shot.

1629
01:08:51,304 --> 01:08:53,338
That was smart to hit him
with the sub-mist.

1630
01:08:53,340 --> 01:08:54,439
Let him land the ship,

1631
01:08:54,441 --> 01:08:56,907
and then we ought to
dump him in the river.

1632
01:08:56,909 --> 01:08:59,377
Who said that?

1633
01:08:59,379 --> 01:09:02,813
Sure. Let's try to
work together. I'm game.

1634
01:09:02,815 --> 01:09:04,649
You want your job back,
Frylock?

1635
01:09:04,651 --> 01:09:06,451
We can do
Amazin' things together.

1636
01:09:06,453 --> 01:09:09,786
Yeah. No, I don't think I'm cut
out for the corporate lifestyle.

1637
01:09:09,788 --> 01:09:13,090
Listen, I know you love
the environment, and so do I.

1638
01:09:13,092 --> 01:09:14,758
We.
We. Yes, we.

1639
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,994
That's why I...
We.

1640
01:09:16,996 --> 01:09:19,896
...we have an ambitious
five-year plan to control

1641
01:09:19,898 --> 01:09:21,765
all the world's
drinking water.

1642
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:24,067
Don't you want to be friends
with the guys

1643
01:09:24,069 --> 01:09:25,670
who own all the water?

1644
01:09:25,672 --> 01:09:27,505
You know,
so we can protect it.

1645
01:09:27,507 --> 01:09:29,307
That sounds terrible.

1646
01:09:29,309 --> 01:09:31,842
You'll wish you said yes.
Shoot him with the mist.

1647
01:09:33,146 --> 01:09:35,113
How are we
out of sub-mist?

1648
01:09:35,115 --> 01:09:37,080
Did someone
use this on me?

1649
01:09:37,082 --> 01:09:39,384
Y'all gonna have to figure out
your evil plans on your own.

1650
01:09:39,386 --> 01:09:41,852
I got people back home
who need me.

1651
01:09:43,956 --> 01:09:47,090
Eternal darkness
all for me!

1652
01:09:47,092 --> 01:09:49,026
Sunlight gone forever.

1653
01:09:49,028 --> 01:09:53,830
New Jersey is all mine!

1654
01:09:55,968 --> 01:09:58,802
The Garden State's
a frozen tundra.

1655
01:09:58,804 --> 01:10:00,971
We're no better
than Green Bay!

1656
01:10:00,973 --> 01:10:03,708
I hope you lowered
your asking price.

1657
01:10:03,710 --> 01:10:06,843
'Cause you ain't gonna get much
for Carl Acres now.

1658
01:10:06,845 --> 01:10:08,845
Why ain't you
f-f-freezing to death?

1659
01:10:08,847 --> 01:10:12,550
'Cause I'm a thicc Shake --
T-H-I-C-C!

1660
01:10:12,552 --> 01:10:14,452
Ice, ice, baby!

1661
01:10:14,454 --> 01:10:17,121
Everyone gets that reference,
right? It's rap music.

1662
01:10:17,123 --> 01:10:19,990
We must shelter the humanoid
inside one of our husks!

1663
01:10:19,992 --> 01:10:22,293
And we can warm him
with our disgusting slime.

1664
01:10:22,295 --> 01:10:25,962
Yeah. I-I-I w-w-would rather die
than do that. No offense.

1665
01:10:25,964 --> 01:10:28,599
None taken.
We are very gross.

1666
01:10:28,601 --> 01:10:31,669
Well, I still think
both your races are weird,

1667
01:10:31,671 --> 01:10:34,539
and I'd be saying atrocious shit
about your mother

1668
01:10:34,541 --> 01:10:38,043
if my lips
weren't completely f-frozen.

1669
01:10:40,213 --> 01:10:43,581
Yeah. Go for it. Start a fire.
He can't see ya.

1670
01:10:43,583 --> 01:10:45,583
Whoa!
That's a big fire!

1671
01:10:50,757 --> 01:10:53,090
New Jersey!
Our tax break!

1672
01:10:53,092 --> 01:10:55,360
There's no city left
to offer one.

1673
01:10:55,362 --> 01:10:57,462
Well, look, we'll
just have to lobby

1674
01:10:57,464 --> 01:10:59,697
some right-to-work state
stupid enough

1675
01:10:59,699 --> 01:11:03,167
to give us tax incentives
to move our operations there.

1676
01:11:03,169 --> 01:11:06,002
Alabama?
Alabama!

1677
01:11:06,004 --> 01:11:07,372
Hey, guys. I --
We.

1678
01:11:07,374 --> 01:11:10,441
Uh, we've got
an amazing opportunity!

1679
01:11:10,443 --> 01:11:13,311
We're about to hire
at our Alabama location,

1680
01:11:13,313 --> 01:11:16,381
and we'll pay you no more than
a third of what you used to get.

1681
01:11:16,383 --> 01:11:19,751
So come on, gang.
Let's roll up our sleeves --

1682
01:11:23,424 --> 01:11:24,956
Oh, oh, oh!

1683
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:28,460
Ooh. D-D-Damn, son.

1684
01:11:28,462 --> 01:11:31,363
I'm glad you guys didn't --
didn't fall for that, though.

1685
01:11:31,365 --> 01:11:34,333
We may not be smart,
but we very well be very dumb!

1686
01:11:34,335 --> 01:11:37,101
We're very good
at being dumb.

1687
01:11:37,103 --> 01:11:38,704
Look, I'm sorry, y'all.

1688
01:11:38,706 --> 01:11:42,073
I forgot what was important
in life -- friendship.

1689
01:11:42,075 --> 01:11:45,277
And even though most of this
is not my fault,

1690
01:11:45,279 --> 01:11:47,446
I'll pretend like it was
if you'll have me back.

1691
01:11:47,448 --> 01:11:50,948
Oh, how I wish it were
that simple, Fry man.

1692
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:53,185
But the existing Aqua Teens

1693
01:11:53,187 --> 01:11:55,421
will need to convene
and vote on --

1694
01:11:55,423 --> 01:11:56,954
Put your hands down,
Carl!

1695
01:11:56,956 --> 01:11:59,324
Your pits stink and you're not
an official Aqua Teen!

1696
01:11:59,326 --> 01:12:01,260
And, Meatwad,
you're on probation

1697
01:12:01,262 --> 01:12:02,795
until you pay those dues.

1698
01:12:02,797 --> 01:12:05,798
So we're back together?
I mean, we're cool, right?

1699
01:12:05,800 --> 01:12:07,266
Uh...

1700
01:12:07,268 --> 01:12:10,669
Your apology doesn't exactly
put food in my mouth.

1701
01:12:10,671 --> 01:12:12,704
Yes, food.
What shall we eat?

1702
01:12:12,706 --> 01:12:15,006
-I, too, am hungry.
-Yeah we're all hungry actually.

1703
01:12:15,008 --> 01:12:16,275
-Yes!
-Yes, we're all hungry.

1704
01:12:16,277 --> 01:12:17,643
I think we're all
pretty hungry.

1705
01:12:17,645 --> 01:12:20,279
Well, I mean,
ain't you guys made of food?

1706
01:12:20,281 --> 01:12:22,481
French fries, milkshake,
and he's all meat.

1707
01:12:22,483 --> 01:12:24,316
Smells really good.

1708
01:12:24,318 --> 01:12:26,552
Whoa. Hey, how about
a little space?

1709
01:12:26,554 --> 01:12:29,053
The Aqua Teens
are together again.

1710
01:12:29,055 --> 01:12:30,255
Ow, damn it.

1711
01:12:30,257 --> 01:12:32,157
Mmm!
Oh, he's good, y'all!

1712
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:34,660
-Eat them!
-Eat them!

1713
01:12:38,965 --> 01:12:41,233
You paid for
a full-length movie

1714
01:12:41,235 --> 01:12:43,669
and you only got
75 minutes.

1715
01:12:43,671 --> 01:12:45,036
Oh, man!

1716
01:12:45,038 --> 01:12:47,539
And that is counting
this extended credits,

1717
01:12:47,541 --> 01:12:49,508
which is really
just pulled out of our asses.

1718
01:12:49,510 --> 01:12:51,376
Yeah, man, I'm in there
like seven times.

1719
01:12:51,378 --> 01:12:52,778
I'm listed as
a producer twice.

1720
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:54,646
They're just using that
to fill space, man,

1721
01:12:54,648 --> 01:12:56,348
because nobody worked
on this.

1722
01:12:56,350 --> 01:12:58,917
Did you think you were gonna
get an extended cut?

1723
01:12:58,919 --> 01:13:00,686
We're not Judd Apatow.

1724
01:13:00,688 --> 01:13:03,455
Look, here, here, here, here,
here, here, here, here.

1725
01:13:03,457 --> 01:13:05,757
Over and over and over.
Everything "Err."

1726
01:13:05,759 --> 01:13:08,427
And you're still watching
the extended credits.

1727
01:13:08,429 --> 01:13:10,329
If you were gonna
look at words,

1728
01:13:10,331 --> 01:13:12,297
why won't you
just read a book?

1729
01:13:12,299 --> 01:13:15,032
Read my book.
It's called "I Rule Your Movie."

1730
01:13:15,034 --> 01:13:16,635
Oh, look at the time.

1731
01:13:16,637 --> 01:13:18,437
You'll have to rent
something else...
Ha ha ha!

1732
01:13:18,439 --> 01:13:21,507
...to provide more entertainment
for your date

1733
01:13:21,509 --> 01:13:25,210
while you awkwardly put your arm
on her shoulder,

1734
01:13:25,212 --> 01:13:28,714
your jizz-shellacked paws
flaking off on her blouse

1735
01:13:28,716 --> 01:13:32,083
as she makes any excuse
to get away from you.

1736
01:13:32,085 --> 01:13:33,752
Your dick is your date.

1737
01:13:33,754 --> 01:13:34,953
That's right, Err.

1738
01:13:34,955 --> 01:13:36,822
Don't put too fine
a point on it.

1739
01:13:36,824 --> 01:13:41,058
We are gender-specific because
we know no women watch us.

1740
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:43,027
Go on.
Find another movie.

1741
01:13:43,029 --> 01:13:45,531
Fill the hours
before you slowly crawl

1742
01:13:45,533 --> 01:13:48,433
back into your bed
alone again.

1743
01:13:48,435 --> 01:13:51,035
Yeah! Go get a snack. How about
a big old jug of grease?

1744
01:13:51,037 --> 01:13:54,006
Yes. Yes.
You have promises to keep

1745
01:13:54,008 --> 01:13:56,408
and pounds of grease
to eat

1746
01:13:56,410 --> 01:13:58,143
before you sleep...
Dumb consumer.

1747
01:13:58,145 --> 01:14:00,145
...alone again.

1748
01:14:06,153 --> 01:14:09,021
♪ Get, get money,
get the money ♪

1749
01:14:10,691 --> 01:14:11,890
♪ Yo ♪

1750
01:14:15,796 --> 01:14:17,029
♪ Yo ♪

1751
01:14:17,031 --> 01:14:19,933
♪ Get, get money,
get the money ♪♪

1752
01:15:11,052 --> 01:15:13,586
Ooh, don't forget
the crispies.

1753
01:15:13,588 --> 01:15:15,788
There you go. Tap the bottom.
Tap, tap, tap.

1754
01:15:15,790 --> 01:15:18,758
There you go.
Don't want to waste one.

1755
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:20,560
-That's actually very good.
-Delicious.

1756
01:15:20,562 --> 01:15:22,595
I feel guilty. You know,
we were neighbors once,

1757
01:15:22,597 --> 01:15:25,765
but, uh, hey, if you don't want
to get eaten, don't be food.

1758
01:15:25,767 --> 01:15:26,933
That's the way I see it.

1759
01:15:26,935 --> 01:15:28,935
You know, I would drink
your blood, Carl,

1760
01:15:28,937 --> 01:15:32,605
but, really, what I'm
in the mood for is...

1761
01:15:32,607 --> 01:15:34,307
ice cream!

1762
01:15:34,309 --> 01:15:36,943
Mmm.

1763
01:15:36,945 --> 01:15:39,412
Ice cream
is the life.

1764
01:15:39,414 --> 01:15:42,248
I smell a sequel!
