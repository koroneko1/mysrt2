1
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:51,084
WHILE PARIS WAS SLEEPING

2
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:14,542
You always keep your eyes shut?

3
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,542
I'm with you.

4
00:16:17,001 --> 00:16:19,126
It helps me be with you.

5
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:21,459
I want to look at you.

6
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,626
Harder. It's good.

7
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:44,376
Harder. Harder.

8
00:19:19,667 --> 00:19:22,834
Right, 11... and ten.

9
00:19:35,917 --> 00:19:38,001
Number 11.

10
00:19:38,126 --> 00:19:40,084
HM.

11
00:19:40,584 --> 00:19:42,459
- Your initials?
- TD.

12
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:44,917
- Thanks, guys.
- Thanks. Bye.

13
00:20:29,876 --> 00:20:31,376
I'll wait outside.

14
00:20:37,376 --> 00:20:39,001
Bye.

15
00:20:43,126 --> 00:20:44,501
Ten.

16
00:20:46,334 --> 00:20:48,209
With a gin and tonic?

17
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:50,084
9.90, thanks.

18
00:20:57,792 --> 00:20:59,834
- Thanks.
- Bye.

19
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:42,792
Come on.

20
00:21:47,042 --> 00:21:49,084
There's a bike station that way.

21
00:21:49,209 --> 00:21:52,292
It's where I park,
so I can stretch my legs.

22
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:57,209
I'll check for bikes.

23
00:21:57,334 --> 00:21:59,376
Before it loads, we'll be there.

24
00:22:20,584 --> 00:22:23,334
I think...
your dick is beautiful.

25
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,959
It is, it's beautiful.

26
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:28,334
I don't know how to say it.

27
00:22:29,251 --> 00:22:30,917
I liked it straight off.

28
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:33,376
And I swear,

29
00:22:33,501 --> 00:22:36,167
your cock is perfect
to the touch.

30
00:22:36,917 --> 00:22:38,084
Come off it.

31
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:40,251
No, I really mean it.

32
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:43,917
A guy's dick is so important.

33
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:50,501
I think you can fall in love
with a guy's dick.

34
00:22:51,209 --> 00:22:52,501
I mean it.

35
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,959
And...

36
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:02,376
I can't wait to see yours again.

37
00:23:03,459 --> 00:23:04,584
Can't wait.

38
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:07,501
I want to touch it...

39
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:10,001
Kiss it.

40
00:23:11,584 --> 00:23:12,917
Suck it.

41
00:23:17,834 --> 00:23:21,417
Ooh... Off the top of my head,
I'd say 11 bicycles.

42
00:23:21,542 --> 00:23:23,459
That's what the app says.

43
00:23:54,626 --> 00:23:58,501
Sorry, I'm obsessive. I can't
help checking everything.

44
00:23:59,292 --> 00:24:02,001
Only with bikes.
Don't jump to conclusions.

45
00:24:03,251 --> 00:24:05,001
This one will do.

46
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:17,417
A little more love in the world.

47
00:25:20,334 --> 00:25:23,459
Tonight, with you,
it was different.

48
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:24,959
Huh?

49
00:25:25,084 --> 00:25:26,626
What did you say?

50
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:29,751
When we made love,
it was unusual.

51
00:25:31,917 --> 00:25:33,459
Because with you...

52
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:37,001
I made love.

53
00:25:37,126 --> 00:25:39,209
We fucked and it was...

54
00:25:39,792 --> 00:25:44,542
I mean, it was like
we were producing love.

55
00:25:45,042 --> 00:25:47,417
We made love,
see what I mean?

56
00:25:47,542 --> 00:25:49,251
I couldn't hear you.

57
00:25:51,084 --> 00:25:52,917
But I agree, it was...

58
00:25:54,709 --> 00:25:58,209
I think we made a big
contribution to world peace.

59
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:01,376
What we did
was pure love creation.

60
00:26:02,042 --> 00:26:03,917
We need to start over.

61
00:26:04,292 --> 00:26:06,251
For the good of humankind!

62
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:28,417
Don't you think?

63
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,334
We have to start over?

64
00:26:38,126 --> 00:26:40,751
- We're going to my place.
- I got it.

65
00:26:40,876 --> 00:26:43,709
Straight ahead.
I'll say when to turn.

66
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:46,834
I can't lose sight of you.

67
00:26:51,459 --> 00:26:54,542
I don't want you to think...
or imagine...

68
00:26:54,667 --> 00:26:56,459
It was strange for me, too.

69
00:27:04,834 --> 00:27:06,917
I'd never done that before.

70
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,542
It was my first time like that.

71
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:13,334
- Uh... At the Impact?
- Yes.

72
00:27:13,459 --> 00:27:16,376
I had a boyfriend before,
for a few months.

73
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,626
Of course we didn't bother.

74
00:27:18,751 --> 00:27:22,042
But, like that,
it was the first time.

75
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,584
It was good.

76
00:27:24,709 --> 00:27:26,542
Better, even. Don't you think?

77
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:29,376
I prefer it that way.

78
00:27:29,501 --> 00:27:31,834
With you, it was really good.

79
00:27:33,334 --> 00:27:35,334
Because it was unusual.

80
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:37,376
Like you said: unusual.

81
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:40,667
Wait, what do you mean?

82
00:27:40,792 --> 00:27:42,251
No way!

83
00:27:44,334 --> 00:27:47,209
You mean you fucked me
without a rubber?

84
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,917
You fucked me without a rubber?

85
00:27:52,542 --> 00:27:54,209
Fuck!

86
00:27:55,709 --> 00:27:58,001
What were you thinking?

87
00:27:58,126 --> 00:27:59,292
Fuck!

88
00:28:02,417 --> 00:28:04,126
You're insane!

89
00:28:12,042 --> 00:28:15,334
You're not two years old!
What the fuck!

90
00:28:15,459 --> 00:28:17,376
You know sex clubs.

91
00:28:19,084 --> 00:28:20,792
Un-fucking-believable!

92
00:28:32,751 --> 00:28:33,876
Right.

93
00:28:34,834 --> 00:28:36,376
I'll call the AIDS hotline.

94
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:39,667
They'll tell us what to do.

95
00:28:39,792 --> 00:28:41,417
Unless you're positive?

96
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:44,459
I knew it.

97
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,251
Hello?

98
00:29:01,376 --> 00:29:02,876
Hello.

99
00:29:03,001 --> 00:29:06,334
Uh... Speedy response. Perfect.

100
00:29:06,459 --> 00:29:07,584
Uh...

101
00:29:08,709 --> 00:29:10,667
The thing is...

102
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,251
I just fucked a guy
without a rubber.

103
00:29:19,501 --> 00:29:21,917
I can't remember.

104
00:29:25,792 --> 00:29:27,917
Uh... Probably.

105
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:33,792
Is he HIV positive?

106
00:29:35,584 --> 00:29:37,001
I think so.

107
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:39,459
Yes, he is.

108
00:29:44,959 --> 00:29:47,126
Uh... Emergency room?

109
00:29:47,792 --> 00:29:50,001
I'm near Saint Louis hospital.

110
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,459
He should come with me. OK.

111
00:30:03,667 --> 00:30:06,459
I get priority?
I tell them at admittance?

112
00:30:10,501 --> 00:30:12,626
I just say ASE?

113
00:30:12,751 --> 00:30:14,126
They'll understand?

114
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,667
I tell them I had an ASE.

115
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:22,834
OK.

116
00:30:23,959 --> 00:30:26,042
And then what happens?

117
00:30:37,376 --> 00:30:39,792
OK, right now. Of course.

118
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,459
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

119
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:02,251
We're going to Saint Louis.

120
00:31:02,376 --> 00:31:04,292
- They said...
- You're not coming.

121
00:31:04,417 --> 00:31:06,584
- She said to go.
- Is it necessary?

122
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:09,751
- It's better.
- Then I'll go alone.

123
00:31:11,584 --> 00:31:15,584
I don't know, your phone call...
it was too weird.

124
00:31:15,709 --> 00:31:17,167
You're too weird.

125
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,667
I want to be alone.

126
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:20,501
- I just wanted...
- Stop it!

127
00:31:20,626 --> 00:31:23,209
I fucked up.
No need to hold my hand.

128
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:26,376
You're mad at me?

129
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,667
I don't know. Maybe.

130
00:31:31,917 --> 00:31:33,626
It's not fair, but, hey...

131
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:36,209
Whatever you feel.

132
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:39,876
We need to swap numbers.

133
00:31:43,084 --> 00:31:46,876
To work out your treatment,
they'll need my results.

134
00:31:47,001 --> 00:31:49,126
You need to be able
to contact me.

135
00:31:49,251 --> 00:31:52,042
- Go ahead... 06.
- No, it's 07.

136
00:31:52,209 --> 00:31:54,834
- 07?
- It's a new number. I changed.

137
00:31:54,959 --> 00:31:56,084
OK, 07...

138
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:57,834
06...

139
00:31:57,959 --> 00:31:59,667
So is it 07 or 06?

140
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,917
0706. It's my number.

141
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:05,709
07 06 86 77 99.

142
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:12,667
The unknown caller is Hugo.

143
00:32:18,084 --> 00:32:19,209
Théo.

144
00:32:23,959 --> 00:32:26,626
- Take rue de Lancry.
- I know.

145
00:32:26,751 --> 00:32:28,834
Take the rue Vellefaux
entrance...

146
00:32:28,959 --> 00:32:30,334
I set it!

147
00:33:07,834 --> 00:33:09,834
I'm not following you.

148
00:33:25,084 --> 00:33:28,167
I take the first right.
Rue Albert Thomas.

149
00:34:33,876 --> 00:34:35,292
<i>I'm with you.</i>

150
00:34:35,959 --> 00:34:38,001
<i>It helps me be with you.</i>

151
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,001
<i>Harder.</i>

152
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,251
<i>Harder.</i>

153
00:35:00,042 --> 00:35:01,376
<i>Harder.</i>

154
00:35:07,709 --> 00:35:08,834
<i>Harder.</i>

155
00:35:14,292 --> 00:35:16,292
<i>Harder.</i>

156
00:36:15,084 --> 00:36:18,459
WHERE ARE YOU?

157
00:36:24,751 --> 00:36:26,167
Emergency room.

158
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:33,042
CALL ME!

159
00:36:37,334 --> 00:36:42,417
WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER?

160
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:59,126
I LEFT YOU A MESSAGE

161
00:37:00,084 --> 00:37:02,834
IT'S IMPORTANT!

162
00:37:58,334 --> 00:38:01,292
Here are your papers.
You can wait over there.

163
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:03,917
- The intern will call you.
- OK, goodbye.

164
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:05,167
Good bye.

165
00:38:07,584 --> 00:38:10,626
- Hello.
- Hello. I had an ASE.

166
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:12,917
OK. How long ago?

167
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:14,292
Under an hour.

168
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,126
Under an hour.
Is your partner here?

169
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:18,917
- No.
-OK.

170
00:38:19,042 --> 00:38:21,959
- Do you have any health issues?
- No.

171
00:38:22,084 --> 00:38:24,042
- Allergies?
- No.

172
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:27,251
- Any medication?
- Nothing.

173
00:38:27,376 --> 00:38:30,792
So I need some identification:
your ID card

174
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:33,167
and your health card
if you have it.

175
00:38:46,709 --> 00:38:49,167
- Still the same address?
- Yes.

176
00:38:49,292 --> 00:38:50,417
OK.

177
00:38:55,084 --> 00:38:57,001
Here are your papers.

178
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,876
You can wait over there.
The intern will see you soon.

179
00:39:01,001 --> 00:39:02,001
- Thanks.
- Goodbye.

180
00:39:02,126 --> 00:39:03,251
Goodbye.

181
00:39:53,001 --> 00:39:56,084
Cellphones are forbidden here.

182
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,501
Even text messages.

183
00:39:58,626 --> 00:40:00,459
I didn't know. Thanks.

184
00:40:05,959 --> 00:40:08,001
I'M HERE. WHERE ARE YOU?

185
00:40:26,251 --> 00:40:29,834
- I can handle this.
- I know. I'm sure... I guess.

186
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:33,292
- Did you get my message?
- I ignored it.

187
00:40:33,417 --> 00:40:36,542
You were so stressed out,
I forgot.

188
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:39,292
Tell the intern
I'm in treatment.

189
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:43,834
I consult regularly and my viral
load is undetectable now.

190
00:40:44,417 --> 00:40:45,626
That's all.

191
00:40:45,751 --> 00:40:48,709
- What's the difference?
- Just tell him.

192
00:40:48,834 --> 00:40:51,417
The AIDS hotline
said it was important.

193
00:40:52,542 --> 00:40:53,751
Great.

194
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:05,126
OK, I admit it.
I thought I should come,

195
00:41:05,251 --> 00:41:07,126
to be with you now,

196
00:41:07,251 --> 00:41:09,459
so you have someone to talk to.

197
00:41:11,459 --> 00:41:14,042
If you want, I can leave.
No problem.

198
00:41:15,209 --> 00:41:16,709
Or I can stay.

199
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:18,959
It's up to you.

200
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:22,084
If you want to know,
I'd like to stay.

201
00:41:22,209 --> 00:41:23,459
I don't know.

202
00:41:23,584 --> 00:41:25,042
I really don't know.

203
00:41:27,167 --> 00:41:28,876
Then I'll decide for you.

204
00:41:30,126 --> 00:41:31,376
Let me see.

205
00:41:32,334 --> 00:41:33,751
What are you doing?

206
00:41:33,876 --> 00:41:36,001
I'm reading your mind.

207
00:41:36,959 --> 00:41:38,751
Your eyes don't lie.

208
00:41:40,334 --> 00:41:41,709
Look me in the eye.

209
00:41:44,042 --> 00:41:46,126
No, better than that.
Look at me.

210
00:41:46,251 --> 00:41:47,834
Straight in the eyes.

211
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:53,292
OK, then. Stay.

212
00:41:54,459 --> 00:41:56,626
It won't take long.

213
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:10,876
Mr Vinaver, please.

214
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:17,917
See you later.

215
00:42:21,126 --> 00:42:23,709
I understand. I've been there.

216
00:42:23,834 --> 00:42:25,001
What?

217
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,959
You're scared?

218
00:42:27,709 --> 00:42:29,376
Yes, I'm scared.

219
00:42:29,501 --> 00:42:31,792
- You stayed to tell me that?
- No.

220
00:42:33,167 --> 00:42:35,376
I wanted to keep you company.

221
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:39,126
I was alone
when I got my results.

222
00:42:40,292 --> 00:42:41,792
And before that, too.

223
00:42:43,334 --> 00:42:45,626
I don't want you
to go through that.

224
00:43:01,292 --> 00:43:02,751
It's not allowed.

225
00:43:02,876 --> 00:43:05,626
Really? Where did you hear that?

226
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,667
Look, I wanted to show you this.

227
00:43:09,917 --> 00:43:13,417
They say,
when there's active penetration,

228
00:43:13,542 --> 00:43:17,459
the risk of infection
is 0.06 to 0.62%.

229
00:43:18,167 --> 00:43:20,834
Hey, that's not allowed.

230
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:23,792
I told your friend earlier.

231
00:43:23,917 --> 00:43:25,917
- I told you?
- You told me.

232
00:43:26,042 --> 00:43:29,959
I knew I told you. You should
have told your friend.

233
00:43:30,084 --> 00:43:32,917
It's OK, I'm done. Relax.

234
00:43:34,084 --> 00:43:36,751
They don't mess around
with that here!

235
00:43:39,376 --> 00:43:41,417
Good... Good.

236
00:43:42,917 --> 00:43:45,251
You can make calls over there.

237
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:47,751
Over there, it's allowed.

238
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:53,251
After all, people need
to be able to make calls.

239
00:43:53,376 --> 00:43:56,459
We're in ER. Things happen.

240
00:43:57,751 --> 00:43:59,542
Deaths, sometimes.

241
00:43:59,667 --> 00:44:03,417
Then you need
to make a phone call, right?

242
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,084
Do you come here often?

243
00:44:08,751 --> 00:44:10,709
No, it's the first time.

244
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:14,709
I need to make a call. Sorry!

245
00:44:14,834 --> 00:44:16,001
Coming?

246
00:44:32,292 --> 00:44:33,542
I need a coffee.

247
00:44:33,667 --> 00:44:37,126
You're not nice.
We could have listened to him.

248
00:44:37,251 --> 00:44:38,751
Did you hear him?

249
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:42,292
"Do we come often?" Like
it's a café or a restaurant.

250
00:44:42,417 --> 00:44:44,251
He's nuts. Keep your distance.

251
00:44:44,376 --> 00:44:46,334
Or he's just lonely.

252
00:45:06,792 --> 00:45:08,126
My treat.

253
00:45:08,251 --> 00:45:09,834
If you want.

254
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:13,417
- No sugar?
- As much as possible.

255
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,917
Show me again... that website.

256
00:45:19,042 --> 00:45:20,501
Really?

257
00:45:20,626 --> 00:45:23,209
- It was a stupid idea.
- Show me.

258
00:45:32,501 --> 00:45:33,584
So?

259
00:45:33,709 --> 00:45:34,792
Thanks.

260
00:45:34,917 --> 00:45:36,126
It's loading.

261
00:45:48,126 --> 00:45:49,376
Show me.

262
00:45:49,501 --> 00:45:50,876
Take a look.

263
00:46:00,709 --> 00:46:02,709
I'm no maths genius.

264
00:46:02,834 --> 00:46:05,792
A risk of 0.62%
is almost nothing.

265
00:46:05,917 --> 00:46:08,001
But people get infected anyway.

266
00:46:09,001 --> 00:46:11,542
Give it back.
It was a stupid idea.

267
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:13,584
Statistics don't mean a thing.

268
00:46:14,584 --> 00:46:16,126
And that's ugly!

269
00:46:17,376 --> 00:46:18,751
Take you, for example.

270
00:46:21,292 --> 00:46:22,626
That's different.

271
00:46:29,459 --> 00:46:31,084
Because you were passive?

272
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:33,751
No need to be an asshole.

273
00:46:37,334 --> 00:46:39,334
It wasn't the same...

274
00:46:41,709 --> 00:46:43,417
because it wasn't the same.

275
00:46:48,501 --> 00:46:50,751
The difference is
I'm in treatment.

276
00:46:51,876 --> 00:46:53,209
I take my drugs.

277
00:46:53,334 --> 00:46:55,584
And my viral load
is undetectable.

278
00:47:08,042 --> 00:47:09,876
I had just got my licence.

279
00:47:11,042 --> 00:47:12,751
I'm from Lons-le-Saunier.

280
00:47:12,876 --> 00:47:15,667
Not even Lons.
Can you imagine?

281
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,834
I don't know the regions.

282
00:47:17,959 --> 00:47:20,209
Maybe Normandy but on vacation.

283
00:47:20,334 --> 00:47:21,751
And Berry.

284
00:47:21,876 --> 00:47:24,001
I'd never met a fag.

285
00:47:24,126 --> 00:47:26,501
And I was 18.

286
00:47:27,126 --> 00:47:28,959
But I knew where they fucked.

287
00:47:29,084 --> 00:47:31,792
At a highway rest station
with toilets.

288
00:47:31,917 --> 00:47:34,126
It's a nice place, really.

289
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:36,084
With big trees.

290
00:47:37,792 --> 00:47:39,917
It's all I could think of
during the test,

291
00:47:40,042 --> 00:47:41,792
that I could go fuck, too.

292
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:44,959
I waited three days
for the pink slip.

293
00:47:45,084 --> 00:47:48,876
It came at last. That night
I borrowed my mum's car

294
00:47:49,001 --> 00:47:50,792
and went out and got laid.

295
00:47:52,334 --> 00:47:53,917
It was pretty lame.

296
00:47:55,876 --> 00:47:57,501
A quick fuck.

297
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,626
Sort of shameful.

298
00:48:01,959 --> 00:48:04,084
No talking. No eye contact.

299
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:09,209
They don't even know
what a rubber is.

300
00:48:09,334 --> 00:48:12,084
Tell them they're gay
and they'd beat you up.

301
00:48:13,334 --> 00:48:14,501
See what I mean?

302
00:48:15,917 --> 00:48:18,001
They don't get treatment.

303
00:48:18,584 --> 00:48:21,084
They don't know
they're HIV positive.

304
00:48:21,209 --> 00:48:23,667
It makes it riskier
for the partner.

305
00:48:23,792 --> 00:48:25,501
It was your first time?

306
00:48:28,042 --> 00:48:31,584
I'm not helping.
I shouldn't have told you that.

307
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:35,042
It's easy to use a rubber,
right?

308
00:48:39,209 --> 00:48:40,917
I'm so stupid.

309
00:48:42,417 --> 00:48:43,542
I'm so stupid.

310
00:48:43,667 --> 00:48:45,751
No, it can happen to anyone.

311
00:48:50,876 --> 00:48:52,667
Come on.

312
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:54,042
Let's go.

313
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:57,584
I'll make you miss your turn.

314
00:49:13,292 --> 00:49:15,209
Mr Daumier? I was waiting.

315
00:49:15,334 --> 00:49:18,001
- Sorry, I was...
- Let's go. It's an emergency.

316
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:22,459
Unbelievable!
They give priority to faggots?

317
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,834
Ignore him. He's a regular.

318
00:49:23,959 --> 00:49:25,876
- Is it normal...
- Let's go.

319
00:49:26,001 --> 00:49:27,667
...to let perverts go first?

320
00:49:31,792 --> 00:49:33,709
Do you want him to come?

321
00:49:33,834 --> 00:49:35,084
Yes.

322
00:49:42,501 --> 00:49:44,084
Go in and sit down.

323
00:49:54,084 --> 00:49:56,001
So what happened?

324
00:49:57,459 --> 00:49:59,959
- I had an ASE.
- I see.

325
00:50:00,084 --> 00:50:02,667
Can I have the details?

326
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,626
- A broken condom.
- OK.

327
00:50:06,084 --> 00:50:07,876
You two. You're the partner?

328
00:50:08,001 --> 00:50:09,959
- Yes, the sexual partner.
- Right.

329
00:50:10,084 --> 00:50:11,376
I'm HIV positive.

330
00:50:12,751 --> 00:50:15,042
OK. Are you on
a triple therapy?

331
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:17,376
Yes, I'm in treatment.

332
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:19,626
Have you consulted lately?

333
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:21,626
About three months ago.

334
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:24,209
OK. Do you know your viral load?

335
00:50:24,334 --> 00:50:25,626
It's undetectable.

336
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:28,584
OK. That's a good thing.

337
00:50:28,709 --> 00:50:32,334
Um... Do you know your status?

338
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:35,167
Yes, I get regular tests.

339
00:50:35,292 --> 00:50:37,959
- I did one two months ago.
- Which was...?

340
00:50:38,084 --> 00:50:41,126
- I'm fine.
- Negative. OK.

341
00:50:41,251 --> 00:50:42,834
I don't take risks.

342
00:50:43,792 --> 00:50:45,584
OK.

343
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:47,001
One more thing.

344
00:50:47,126 --> 00:50:50,209
Uh... who was active
during intercourse?

345
00:50:50,334 --> 00:50:52,917
- I was active.
- OK.

346
00:50:53,042 --> 00:50:56,376
When the condom broke,
did you pull out immediately?

347
00:50:56,501 --> 00:50:57,751
No, I didn't pull out.

348
00:50:57,876 --> 00:51:00,084
So there was an ejaculation?

349
00:51:00,209 --> 00:51:01,209
OK.

350
00:51:01,334 --> 00:51:03,792
In any case,
since your partner's positive,

351
00:51:03,917 --> 00:51:07,459
treatment is advised.
An emergency triple therapy.

352
00:51:08,417 --> 00:51:13,709
The idea is to stop the virus
reproducing in your body.

353
00:51:13,834 --> 00:51:17,834
Uh... It's pretty
heavy-duty therapy.

354
00:51:17,959 --> 00:51:20,792
It lasts 28 days.

355
00:51:20,917 --> 00:51:23,334
Three pills a day,
at the same time,

356
00:51:23,459 --> 00:51:25,042
every 24 hours.

357
00:51:25,167 --> 00:51:28,001
Do you agree to the treatment?

358
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,251
Yes.

359
00:51:31,501 --> 00:51:35,334
I'll go get the pills
and I'll explain everything.

360
00:51:50,876 --> 00:51:52,126
Are you OK?

361
00:52:23,126 --> 00:52:24,751
This is the kit.

362
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,126
Here's how it works.

363
00:52:31,292 --> 00:52:34,001
There's a bottle of water
and a cake,

364
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:38,876
because it's better to eat
at the same time.

365
00:52:39,209 --> 00:52:42,584
For now you have
four days of pills.

366
00:52:42,709 --> 00:52:46,084
On Monday, you have to go
to the screening unit,

367
00:52:46,209 --> 00:52:48,042
here at the hospital.

368
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:51,626
No need for an appointment.
Explain what happened.

369
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:55,167
They'll see you right away.

370
00:52:55,292 --> 00:52:57,709
It's best if you come, too,

371
00:52:57,834 --> 00:52:59,167
with your results.

372
00:52:59,292 --> 00:53:00,667
OK, I'm free on Monday.

373
00:53:00,792 --> 00:53:02,376
- Right.
- Yes.

374
00:53:02,501 --> 00:53:06,167
On Monday,
we'll do new blood tests.

375
00:53:06,292 --> 00:53:09,959
The doctor will decide if
you'll continue the treatment.

376
00:53:10,084 --> 00:53:12,084
He'll see how you tolerate it.

377
00:53:12,209 --> 00:53:15,251
The side effects
are mostly digestive.

378
00:53:15,376 --> 00:53:18,251
Nausea and diarrhoea

379
00:53:18,376 --> 00:53:21,251
- and maybe some fatigue.
- OK.

380
00:53:21,376 --> 00:53:24,042
If you really react badly,
we can change.

381
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:28,376
But the symptoms
usually improve.

382
00:53:28,501 --> 00:53:31,084
- OK.
- It's mostly the first days.

383
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:35,167
Right. Let's start right now.

384
00:53:35,292 --> 00:53:38,501
It's best to start
as soon as possible.

385
00:53:38,626 --> 00:53:41,292
One of each colour today.

386
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:43,584
Afterwards, you take the rest.

387
00:53:43,709 --> 00:53:46,501
- Do I start by eating?
- If you want.

388
00:53:52,292 --> 00:53:53,584
All of it?

389
00:54:33,292 --> 00:54:34,709
I need some water.

390
00:54:44,501 --> 00:54:46,376
Now, take the three pills.

391
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,209
- One of each?
- Yes.

392
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,126
You're OK?

393
00:55:40,126 --> 00:55:41,126
Yes.

394
00:55:41,251 --> 00:55:42,376
Good.

395
00:55:44,126 --> 00:55:45,917
Here's the kit.

396
00:55:47,751 --> 00:55:49,334
It's for four days.

397
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:56,209
It's not a nice thing to go
through. It's a bit stressful.

398
00:55:56,334 --> 00:55:59,626
But you can get help on Monday.

399
00:55:59,751 --> 00:56:01,917
The two of you are here, now.

400
00:56:02,042 --> 00:56:05,417
It's good if you support him
during this ordeal.

401
00:56:06,084 --> 00:56:09,584
It will be OK because
we're within the time frame.

402
00:56:09,709 --> 00:56:13,167
If you take the treatment
every 24 hours,

403
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:16,959
there's a very good chance
the virus won't spread

404
00:56:17,084 --> 00:56:20,834
and at the end,
you'll still be HIV negative.

405
00:56:20,959 --> 00:56:22,667
OK?

406
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:23,917
Right...

407
00:56:24,792 --> 00:56:26,251
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

408
00:56:26,376 --> 00:56:28,667
You're welcome.
I'll see you out.

409
00:56:37,334 --> 00:56:38,876
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

410
00:57:38,876 --> 00:57:40,001
- Hello.
- Hello.

411
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:41,251
Hello.

412
00:58:17,042 --> 00:58:18,584
- Did you notice?
- Hm?

413
00:58:18,709 --> 00:58:21,001
- Women run this place.
- Yeah.

414
00:58:21,126 --> 00:58:24,626
Guys leave the worst jobs
to women. What a shitty world!

415
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:27,042
Yeah. Women and fags.

416
00:58:27,167 --> 00:58:28,917
The night belongs
to women and fags.

417
00:58:55,917 --> 00:58:57,834
And night watchmen.

418
00:58:57,959 --> 00:59:01,792
That's a position of power.
Limited power but even so...

419
00:59:01,917 --> 00:59:03,251
He's black.

420
00:59:03,376 --> 00:59:06,167
Of course.
Like I said, limited power.

421
00:59:46,292 --> 00:59:47,584
Are you a hairdresser?

422
00:59:48,792 --> 00:59:52,001
What makes you say that?
Is it my nail polish?

423
00:59:52,126 --> 00:59:54,334
No, it's Monday.

424
00:59:54,459 --> 00:59:57,167
Hairdressers always close
on Monday.

425
00:59:57,292 --> 01:00:00,126
Lots of stores close on Monday.

426
01:00:00,709 --> 01:00:03,584
You can't buy food,
except in supermarkets.

427
01:00:03,709 --> 01:00:05,959
So are you a grocer?

428
01:00:06,084 --> 01:00:07,459
A baker? A cheese seller?

429
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:12,292
No. I'm a notary's clerk.

430
01:00:12,417 --> 01:00:14,667
My boss gives me Monday off.

431
01:00:15,459 --> 01:00:17,376
Sometimes, in exchange,

432
01:00:17,501 --> 01:00:21,084
I stay late
or I finish work at the weekend.

433
01:00:21,209 --> 01:00:24,084
Either way, it works for me.

434
01:00:24,584 --> 01:00:27,376
I love not starting the week
with everyone else.

435
01:00:27,501 --> 01:00:29,501
More than having Friday off.

436
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,959
Seriously?
You're a notary's clerk?

437
01:00:32,084 --> 01:00:34,626
I know, it sounds impressive.

438
01:00:34,751 --> 01:00:36,751
But it's a job like any other.

439
01:00:36,876 --> 01:00:38,459
Better than many others.

440
01:00:39,251 --> 01:00:41,084
I want to be a notary.

441
01:00:41,209 --> 01:00:45,001
But you have to study for
a long time and it's expensive.

442
01:00:45,126 --> 01:00:47,001
I had to get out of my village.

443
01:00:47,584 --> 01:00:50,709
I needed to work.
I became a clerk

444
01:00:50,834 --> 01:00:52,334
to become a notary.

445
01:00:52,459 --> 01:00:54,792
It takes longer,
but I'm independent

446
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,709
and I got out of the Jura.

447
01:00:58,292 --> 01:01:00,001
I'm happy with my life.

448
01:01:05,334 --> 01:01:06,709
It's weird.

449
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:09,126
We turned left
out of the hospital,

450
01:01:09,251 --> 01:01:12,292
without thinking.
Where are you going?

451
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:15,376
I don't know. I'm following you.

452
01:01:16,376 --> 01:01:17,834
I'm following you, too.

453
01:01:18,501 --> 01:01:19,959
We'll go round in circles.

454
01:01:24,251 --> 01:01:26,667
It's late.
You're heading home?

455
01:01:28,459 --> 01:01:29,959
You're not exhausted?

456
01:01:30,084 --> 01:01:32,251
If you want me to go,
just say so.

457
01:01:32,376 --> 01:01:33,959
That's not what I meant.

458
01:01:34,084 --> 01:01:37,084
But if you want
to go get some sleep...

459
01:01:37,209 --> 01:01:39,084
I like being with you.

460
01:01:39,626 --> 01:01:44,209
Even if... the circumstances
could be better.

461
01:01:44,876 --> 01:01:46,834
I don't feel like sleeping.

462
01:01:47,292 --> 01:01:48,501
Do you?

463
01:01:51,126 --> 01:01:52,626
I'm hungry.

464
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:55,501
Do you think
the bakeries are open?

465
01:01:55,876 --> 01:01:57,209
Let's try over there.

466
01:02:03,251 --> 01:02:05,042
We'll find something.

467
01:02:11,501 --> 01:02:13,501
It does me good being with you.

468
01:02:13,626 --> 01:02:15,001
You're good for me.

469
01:02:21,792 --> 01:02:23,292
Why are you going this way?

470
01:02:23,417 --> 01:02:24,709
It's random.

471
01:02:25,459 --> 01:02:27,709
There's nothing on the canal.

472
01:02:27,834 --> 01:02:29,084
Do you think?

473
01:02:29,584 --> 01:02:30,917
Probably.

474
01:02:31,626 --> 01:02:33,001
But it's beautiful.

475
01:02:33,751 --> 01:02:36,876
Is this a romantic walk
or a food hunt?

476
01:02:37,001 --> 01:02:38,876
We can do both.

477
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:41,501
I'm not so sure about the walk.

478
01:03:20,459 --> 01:03:21,917
Feels good, doesn't it?

479
01:03:23,251 --> 01:03:26,126
It's a new concept:
the romantic sprint.

480
01:03:26,251 --> 01:03:27,334
Very funny.

481
01:03:27,459 --> 01:03:29,667
We'd have more luck
on the other side.

482
01:03:29,792 --> 01:03:31,459
Let's not cross the canal.

483
01:03:31,584 --> 01:03:33,167
OK, why?

484
01:03:33,292 --> 01:03:36,459
It's a game.
Let's go that way.

485
01:03:36,584 --> 01:03:39,501
It's worse over there.
There's nothing.

486
01:03:39,626 --> 01:03:41,292
Let's try Stalingrad.

487
01:03:41,417 --> 01:03:42,501
No!

488
01:04:00,167 --> 01:04:01,959
Did you have side effects?

489
01:04:02,626 --> 01:04:04,667
I want to know what's coming.

490
01:04:05,084 --> 01:04:06,792
It's dead here.

491
01:04:07,417 --> 01:04:09,626
Civilisation starts
at Stalingrad.

492
01:04:10,834 --> 01:04:12,292
You didn't answer.

493
01:04:16,959 --> 01:04:19,334
The drugs are not the problem.

494
01:04:19,459 --> 01:04:21,501
You get used to taking them.

495
01:04:22,084 --> 01:04:25,792
It's not so unmanageable now.
You can skip a pill,

496
01:04:25,917 --> 01:04:27,792
but not too often.

497
01:04:29,251 --> 01:04:32,084
When you have a normal life
with a job,

498
01:04:32,209 --> 01:04:34,834
it's part of the routine,
like a habit.

499
01:04:35,834 --> 01:04:38,334
The side effects go away,

500
01:04:38,459 --> 01:04:40,417
or you change treatment.

501
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:46,042
The problem is the virus.

502
01:04:47,376 --> 01:04:48,584
I mean...

503
01:04:49,709 --> 01:04:51,667
even if it's undetectable.

504
01:04:52,834 --> 01:04:56,292
Even if I'm not scared any more
that it will kill me.

505
01:04:58,334 --> 01:04:59,626
It's there.

506
01:05:00,584 --> 01:05:01,959
I think about it.

507
01:05:02,501 --> 01:05:03,876
Often.

508
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:11,126
They say, "Live with it."

509
01:05:12,501 --> 01:05:14,376
But I can't.

510
01:05:14,501 --> 01:05:16,126
I live against it.

511
01:05:16,251 --> 01:05:18,209
I try to live against it.

512
01:05:19,084 --> 01:05:20,751
I'm probably wrong.

513
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:22,501
I should live with it.

514
01:05:22,626 --> 01:05:24,459
Make my peace with it.

515
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:27,626
But I can't.

516
01:05:36,584 --> 01:05:38,709
Is this the right direction?

517
01:05:38,834 --> 01:05:41,876
I'm a stomach on legs.
If there was food,

518
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:43,667
my instinct would tell me.

519
01:05:43,834 --> 01:05:46,626
Where else is there?
It's civilised that way.

520
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:49,001
- My instinct?
-No such thing.

521
01:06:15,917 --> 01:06:18,209
I can't explain it.

522
01:06:18,334 --> 01:06:20,751
I want to kiss you
and punch you.

523
01:06:21,959 --> 01:06:24,042
I want to hit you now.

524
01:06:24,167 --> 01:06:25,959
Hard, really hard.

525
01:06:26,834 --> 01:06:28,209
That's nice.

526
01:06:29,876 --> 01:06:31,584
Would you feel better?

527
01:06:31,709 --> 01:06:33,292
I don't know.

528
01:06:33,417 --> 01:06:35,251
I want to.

529
01:06:35,376 --> 01:06:37,084
I'm itching to do it.

530
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:39,917
Itching all over.

531
01:07:28,084 --> 01:07:31,334
Want to try
a 24-hour kebab joint?

532
01:07:31,459 --> 01:07:33,917
A kebab? If I have to.

533
01:07:35,167 --> 01:07:39,167
Who eats kebabs at 6:00
besides fags just out of ER?

534
01:07:39,292 --> 01:07:42,917
Night workers or guys who
start work on a full stomach.

535
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:48,292
You could have said
you had a plan.

536
01:07:48,417 --> 01:07:50,001
It's more fun this way.

537
01:07:58,792 --> 01:08:00,251
- Hello.
- Good morning.

538
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:03,376
You're right. What time is it?

539
01:08:03,501 --> 01:08:05,917
5:30 but I'm running early.

540
01:08:06,042 --> 01:08:07,876
You're out of kebabs?

541
01:08:08,001 --> 01:08:09,876
Sorry, all sold out.

542
01:08:10,001 --> 01:08:11,709
I have other things.

543
01:08:12,917 --> 01:08:14,917
- I'll have chicken.
- One chicken?

544
01:08:15,042 --> 01:08:16,251
- No, two.
- Two.

545
01:08:16,376 --> 01:08:17,959
Running made me hungry.

546
01:08:20,751 --> 01:08:22,417
But you're right.

547
01:08:23,126 --> 01:08:25,584
A kebab is good after partying.

548
01:08:25,709 --> 01:08:29,334
I only work weekends.
I serve the party-goers.

549
01:08:29,459 --> 01:08:31,501
- No onions.
- Me neither.

550
01:08:36,292 --> 01:08:40,334
It's dead now but until three or
four o'clock, I'm really busy.

551
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:43,584
Where I'm from,
you have tea after.

552
01:08:43,709 --> 01:08:46,167
- Where are you from?
- I'm Syrian.

553
01:08:47,167 --> 01:08:49,376
With my university buddies,

554
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:53,209
it was a ritual to eat a kebab
after a night on the town.

555
01:08:53,334 --> 01:08:55,959
It's not exactly
the same as here.

556
01:08:56,084 --> 01:08:57,709
The meat in Syria...

557
01:08:58,917 --> 01:09:00,584
Are you here because of the war?

558
01:09:00,709 --> 01:09:01,834
No.

559
01:09:04,459 --> 01:09:07,209
I studied architecture
in Damascus.

560
01:09:11,792 --> 01:09:13,584
The war is horrible.

561
01:09:14,709 --> 01:09:16,501
But there was
too much injustice.

562
01:09:18,501 --> 01:09:21,417
After a while,
people can't stand it any more.

563
01:09:22,126 --> 01:09:23,876
Forty-five years...

564
01:09:24,001 --> 01:09:25,334
It's a long time.

565
01:09:29,709 --> 01:09:31,626
I didn't live there.

566
01:09:31,751 --> 01:09:33,167
I survived.

567
01:09:36,251 --> 01:09:38,542
I guess you can't understand,

568
01:09:38,667 --> 01:09:41,167
because you're free here.

569
01:09:43,876 --> 01:09:46,209
We couldn't talk.

570
01:09:46,334 --> 01:09:47,834
Not to anybody.

571
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:50,084
Not even my university buddies.

572
01:09:50,917 --> 01:09:53,376
A life without talking
is unbearable.

573
01:09:53,501 --> 01:09:57,542
About politics,
or even just what we feel.

574
01:09:57,667 --> 01:09:59,209
Our desires...

575
01:10:01,834 --> 01:10:03,542
Here you are.

576
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:05,209
Twelve euros.

577
01:10:05,334 --> 01:10:06,667
I'll get it.

578
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,334
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

579
01:10:14,459 --> 01:10:15,792
- Goodbye.
- Have a nice day.

580
01:10:20,167 --> 01:10:22,042
I bet you're still a student.

581
01:10:22,167 --> 01:10:23,959
No, not exactly.

582
01:10:26,167 --> 01:10:30,501
Uh... How about we go eat
somewhere calm?

583
01:10:32,251 --> 01:10:34,167
I know. Over by the canal.

584
01:10:39,667 --> 01:10:41,667
Tell me, what do you do?

585
01:10:42,251 --> 01:10:44,876
You ask all the questions.

586
01:10:48,167 --> 01:10:49,626
What do you want to know?

587
01:10:49,751 --> 01:10:52,251
Well, first up, what do you do?

588
01:10:52,376 --> 01:10:53,834
An internship.

589
01:10:53,959 --> 01:10:56,334
I have a master's
in industrial design.

590
01:10:56,459 --> 01:10:58,501
I'm an intern in a big company.

591
01:10:58,626 --> 01:11:00,167
It's interesting.

592
01:11:02,042 --> 01:11:03,876
You don't sound convinced.

593
01:11:04,001 --> 01:11:07,792
I am, but right now
I want to do other things.

594
01:11:07,917 --> 01:11:10,584
I want to be an aid worker.

595
01:11:10,709 --> 01:11:14,084
Yeah... I can't see
the connection with design.

596
01:11:14,209 --> 01:11:15,709
There isn't one.

597
01:11:15,834 --> 01:11:19,126
I feel like I need
the experience.

598
01:11:19,251 --> 01:11:21,334
A few months. A year, max.

599
01:11:22,417 --> 01:11:26,834
OK, so I haven't done
any research. It's a pipe dream.

600
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:30,626
Let's go up there.

601
01:11:33,584 --> 01:11:36,459
I don't know
humanitarian causes,

602
01:11:36,584 --> 01:11:39,459
but I guess
there's plenty to do.

603
01:11:40,292 --> 01:11:42,292
At least in logistics.

604
01:11:42,417 --> 01:11:44,459
- You like to travel?
- Yeah.

605
01:11:44,584 --> 01:11:46,917
But there's more to it.

606
01:11:47,751 --> 01:11:50,417
You think it's ridiculous?
Sentimental?

607
01:11:52,209 --> 01:11:54,292
No, I don't know. Why?

608
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:59,001
Anyway, signing up for...
any cause is sentimental.

609
01:11:59,126 --> 01:12:00,709
Sentimentality is beautiful.

610
01:12:00,834 --> 01:12:02,209
Yeah.

611
01:12:02,334 --> 01:12:06,084
I feel ridiculous
when I tell you that.

612
01:12:06,209 --> 01:12:09,751
If only I could say which cause,
or which country.

613
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,834
Like some student.
"I'll do this, I'll do that!"

614
01:12:13,959 --> 01:12:16,126
They never get off their asses.

615
01:12:16,251 --> 01:12:18,084
They pissed me off!

616
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:23,542
If I'm HIV positive, that's
the end of the wild ideas.

617
01:12:23,667 --> 01:12:26,042
No visits to countries
without aspirin.

618
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:28,209
I'd need emergency care myself.

619
01:12:28,334 --> 01:12:29,501
Would you go?

620
01:12:30,084 --> 01:12:31,709
No, of course not.

621
01:12:59,001 --> 01:13:00,626
What else
did you want to know?

622
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:06,042
OK, why does
your phone number start with 07?

623
01:13:06,167 --> 01:13:08,959
- It's unusual.
- Look at you!

624
01:13:09,084 --> 01:13:12,876
You tried for an easy question,
that can't hurt anyone.

625
01:13:13,001 --> 01:13:15,459
- Bad move.
- You think it's funny?

626
01:13:15,584 --> 01:13:16,584
Yeah.

627
01:13:16,709 --> 01:13:20,251
You tried to be nice
and made it worse.

628
01:13:20,376 --> 01:13:23,626
You tried so hard,
I can't be mad at you.

629
01:13:23,751 --> 01:13:25,709
Should I stop asking questions?

630
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:27,417
For now, yes.

631
01:13:28,834 --> 01:13:30,501
Let's go to the end.

632
01:13:30,626 --> 01:13:32,251
I love this place.

633
01:13:59,584 --> 01:14:01,584
- It's nice.
- Yeah.

634
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:12,959
Come on.

635
01:14:13,084 --> 01:14:14,626
Let's eat.

636
01:14:28,876 --> 01:14:31,001
Can you hold this?

637
01:14:31,126 --> 01:14:32,251
Thanks.

638
01:14:33,751 --> 01:14:35,834
It's early
but it doesn't matter.

639
01:14:36,792 --> 01:14:38,584
I always have them on me.

640
01:14:38,709 --> 01:14:40,584
That way, I can't be caught out.

641
01:14:41,334 --> 01:14:43,126
Even when you fuck
at the Impact?

642
01:14:43,251 --> 01:14:45,251
You never know
when you'll find love.

643
01:14:46,251 --> 01:14:48,459
Sometimes I get home late.

644
01:14:48,584 --> 01:14:49,917
I can see that.

645
01:14:50,917 --> 01:14:54,084
It's happened before?
It's not the first time.

646
01:14:54,209 --> 01:14:55,501
Yes.

647
01:14:55,626 --> 01:14:58,209
No, it's never happened before.

648
01:14:58,334 --> 01:14:59,792
Usually...

649
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:03,376
Listen, I don't know...

650
01:15:04,001 --> 01:15:07,042
Something happened between us,
something big.

651
01:15:07,167 --> 01:15:08,251
That's all.

652
01:15:08,376 --> 01:15:11,167
Something big?
What do you mean?

653
01:15:11,292 --> 01:15:14,751
I don't know.
Something that made me...

654
01:15:15,834 --> 01:15:17,584
lower my guard.

655
01:15:19,042 --> 01:15:21,251
What do you usually tell them?

656
01:15:21,376 --> 01:15:22,876
How does it go?

657
01:15:23,001 --> 01:15:25,542
Wait, where are you going
with this?

658
01:15:25,667 --> 01:15:27,417
What do you want me to say?

659
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:31,126
Hey, wait a minute!

660
01:15:31,834 --> 01:15:33,626
What do you want?

661
01:15:33,751 --> 01:15:36,334
For me to tattoo HIV+ on my ass?

662
01:15:36,917 --> 01:15:39,917
Because idiots like you
don't take precautions!

663
01:15:40,751 --> 01:15:44,209
It takes two to screw up.
I didn't have to beg you!

664
01:15:44,876 --> 01:15:46,334
I never asked you to do that.

665
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,501
Of course not. "Harder, harder."

666
01:15:48,626 --> 01:15:51,292
You didn't ask me,
but you said, "Harder, harder"?

667
01:15:52,417 --> 01:15:54,167
It's always our fault.

668
01:15:55,459 --> 01:15:57,251
You're a dumb asshole.

669
01:15:59,209 --> 01:16:01,084
What am I doing here?

670
01:16:01,751 --> 01:16:03,751
I promised to come on Monday.

671
01:16:03,876 --> 01:16:05,542
I'll be there with my results.

672
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:08,042
If you don't want me to stay,
fine!

673
01:16:08,167 --> 01:16:10,126
You have my number
if you need it.

674
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:21,334
I'm sorry.

675
01:16:34,876 --> 01:16:35,917
I'm sorry.

676
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:39,126
Don't. No apologies between us.

677
01:16:39,251 --> 01:16:41,751
- We both fucked up.
- Both of us.

678
01:16:41,876 --> 01:16:44,126
- At the same time.
- Hand in hand.

679
01:16:57,959 --> 01:17:00,709
I think I felt safe with you.

680
01:17:02,042 --> 01:17:06,959
I didn't really think.
I felt good, calm, happy.

681
01:17:09,584 --> 01:17:12,376
It seems irrational now.
It made sense then.

682
01:17:12,501 --> 01:17:16,167
Yes, it made sense.
Made sense.

683
01:17:16,834 --> 01:17:20,126
Between us,
everything made sense.

684
01:17:20,251 --> 01:17:22,417
We got careless.

685
01:17:23,917 --> 01:17:27,209
We wanted each other.
Wanted it too much.

686
01:17:27,334 --> 01:17:28,917
We didn't realise.

687
01:17:30,209 --> 01:17:31,792
Desire is stupid.

688
01:17:33,417 --> 01:17:35,959
But it's good
to want you like I do.

689
01:17:38,376 --> 01:17:41,376
- Were you drunk?
- Not really.

690
01:17:41,501 --> 01:17:44,584
Me neither.
But it was like being drunk.

691
01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:47,667
See? Desire is stupid.

692
01:17:53,042 --> 01:17:55,501
I have a monster hard-on.

693
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:04,251
Strange way
to start a relationship.

694
01:18:05,084 --> 01:18:09,292
- Relationship?
- Yes. Why not?

695
01:18:09,417 --> 01:18:13,042
You're crazy. Stop it.

696
01:18:15,501 --> 01:18:17,626
I'm going home now.

697
01:18:17,751 --> 01:18:19,584
Can I come too?

698
01:18:19,709 --> 01:18:21,376
If you want.

699
01:18:26,001 --> 01:18:28,876
If we rush,
we can take the first metro.

700
01:18:29,001 --> 01:18:30,876
I love the first metro.

701
01:18:53,501 --> 01:18:55,376
After the first
comes the second.

702
01:18:55,501 --> 01:18:58,542
That's the one we need to take.
I know it.

703
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,126
Trust me.

704
01:19:43,584 --> 01:19:48,626
- How do we know it's the first?
- I know. But we can check.

705
01:19:51,626 --> 01:19:54,001
Excuse me, ma'am.

706
01:19:54,126 --> 01:19:55,667
Is this the first metro?

707
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,542
Yes, it's the first.

708
01:19:57,667 --> 01:19:59,542
See? It's the first.

709
01:19:59,667 --> 01:20:01,292
She said it's the first.

710
01:20:02,584 --> 01:20:05,917
- You're not regulars?
- No.

711
01:20:06,042 --> 01:20:07,959
I take it every day.

712
01:20:08,084 --> 01:20:09,501
I'm not the only one.

713
01:20:09,626 --> 01:20:12,459
I know everyone... by sight.

714
01:20:13,501 --> 01:20:17,251
I'm a chambermaid
in a fancy hotel.

715
01:20:20,709 --> 01:20:27,001
I didn't work long enough
to get a decent pension.

716
01:20:27,126 --> 01:20:28,751
That's all I could find.

717
01:20:31,084 --> 01:20:33,167
I'm not from around here.

718
01:20:33,292 --> 01:20:35,459
Yvetot. Do you know it?

719
01:20:36,292 --> 01:20:38,667
- No, I'm from Lons.
- I'm from Paris.

720
01:20:47,667 --> 01:20:51,459
Before, I mostly worked
in retail.

721
01:20:51,584 --> 01:20:53,167
In sales.

722
01:20:55,417 --> 01:20:57,126
<i>La Chapelle.</i>

723
01:21:02,917 --> 01:21:04,001
<i>La Chapelle.</i>

724
01:21:04,126 --> 01:21:06,084
I've had a hectic life.

725
01:21:12,292 --> 01:21:14,126
I fell in love too often.

726
01:21:28,001 --> 01:21:31,001
The job centre
can't handle people like me.

727
01:21:31,126 --> 01:21:34,876
So, of course... it's cleaning.

728
01:21:39,417 --> 01:21:41,042
It's good with my cousin.

729
01:21:41,167 --> 01:21:44,292
We've made ourselves a life,
just us girls.

730
01:21:48,251 --> 01:21:51,876
No, but... it's not so bad
when you think about it.

731
01:21:56,792 --> 01:21:59,001
I like Paris.

732
01:21:59,126 --> 01:22:02,792
It's... it's big.
It's anonymous.

733
01:22:02,917 --> 01:22:06,751
I think you're better off
in anonymous places.

734
01:22:06,876 --> 01:22:09,459
- Right?
- Yeah.

735
01:22:17,126 --> 01:22:19,376
The first metro...

736
01:22:20,209 --> 01:22:21,626
is not so bad.

737
01:22:28,084 --> 01:22:30,084
<i>Barbès-Rochechouart.</i>

738
01:22:32,209 --> 01:22:33,501
I get off here.

739
01:22:35,334 --> 01:22:36,459
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

740
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:38,251
- Have a nice day.
- You, too.

741
01:22:38,376 --> 01:22:39,501
Thanks.

742
01:23:28,209 --> 01:23:29,501
<i>Anvers.</i>

743
01:23:34,792 --> 01:23:36,917
- It's here.
- <i>Anvers.</i>

744
01:23:37,042 --> 01:23:38,209
Let's go.

745
01:23:48,001 --> 01:23:50,501
Being a notary is weird.

746
01:23:51,792 --> 01:23:54,251
How do you decide
to be a notary?

747
01:23:54,376 --> 01:23:58,626
It doesn't come to mind
when you plan your future.

748
01:23:58,751 --> 01:24:01,042
People mostly lack imagination.

749
01:24:04,376 --> 01:24:07,126
I got the calling
from reading Balzac.

750
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,001
Mauriac, too.

751
01:24:10,126 --> 01:24:12,501
I haven't read much Balzac,

752
01:24:12,626 --> 01:24:15,667
but aren't notaries
lame pencil-pushers?

753
01:24:16,209 --> 01:24:17,709
I mean, in novels.

754
01:24:17,834 --> 01:24:22,501
In real life, it's so...
exotic that it's sexy.

755
01:24:57,667 --> 01:24:59,126
It's over there.

756
01:25:03,501 --> 01:25:06,709
It's not the characters
that inspired me.

757
01:25:06,834 --> 01:25:07,959
It's that...

758
01:25:08,792 --> 01:25:10,126
Well...

759
01:25:10,251 --> 01:25:13,084
Balzac is life inside families.

760
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:15,126
He goes to the heart of things:

761
01:25:15,251 --> 01:25:17,459
money matters, property.

762
01:25:17,584 --> 01:25:19,584
Everything we never mention.

763
01:25:19,709 --> 01:25:21,917
Everything essential to society.

764
01:25:22,042 --> 01:25:24,834
- For rich people.
- Not only.

765
01:25:35,709 --> 01:25:38,751
It's true, our clients
are not often labourers.

766
01:25:38,876 --> 01:25:40,959
But they can be low-income.

767
01:25:41,584 --> 01:25:44,501
All it takes
is a tiny inheritance,

768
01:25:44,626 --> 01:25:47,376
a little house
or even a bit of land.

769
01:25:47,501 --> 01:25:50,542
You can't imagine
the emotion involved.

770
01:25:50,667 --> 01:25:52,459
It can break your heart.

771
01:25:54,501 --> 01:25:57,459
They're stories
nobody can tell you.

772
01:25:59,209 --> 01:26:00,959
You can't make them up.

773
01:26:01,084 --> 01:26:05,001
- Unless you're Balzac.
- Yeah. Or Mauriac.

774
01:26:10,834 --> 01:26:14,626
Balzac wrote a novel called
<i>The Seamy Side of History.</i>

775
01:26:14,751 --> 01:26:16,292
That's exactly it.

776
01:26:16,417 --> 01:26:20,167
From where I am,
I see the seamy side of history.

777
01:26:29,667 --> 01:26:31,376
Can I come upstairs?

778
01:26:32,251 --> 01:26:33,876
To see where you live.

779
01:26:58,876 --> 01:27:01,626
It's just a maid's room.
It's six flights up.

780
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:04,376
- No big deal.
- It's nothing special.

781
01:27:04,501 --> 01:27:06,792
It has to be special.

782
01:27:06,917 --> 01:27:09,959
You leave your mark
where you live.

783
01:27:10,084 --> 01:27:12,917
In some homes,
it's like no one lives there.

784
01:27:13,042 --> 01:27:14,251
Ever noticed?

785
01:27:14,376 --> 01:27:16,209
I know what you mean.

786
01:27:16,334 --> 01:27:18,042
It's a bad sign.

787
01:27:18,167 --> 01:27:19,667
You want my interior to prove...

788
01:27:19,792 --> 01:27:20,959
That you are.

789
01:27:21,084 --> 01:27:22,584
That's it. That you are.

790
01:27:22,709 --> 01:27:27,126
People with nobody home are not,
or not really.

791
01:27:28,084 --> 01:27:31,292
- What if I'm like that?
- Impossible.

792
01:27:31,417 --> 01:27:34,042
But if you are,
you'll never see me again.

793
01:27:41,334 --> 01:27:44,334
Maybe I'll study urban planning.

794
01:27:44,959 --> 01:27:47,292
- Notaries can specialise.
- Really?

795
01:27:47,417 --> 01:27:50,376
- Isn't seamy history your thing?
- That too.

796
01:27:50,501 --> 01:27:54,376
It's an idea that just hit me.
I think it has legs.

797
01:27:54,501 --> 01:27:56,917
- It's a good idea, right?
- Sure.

798
01:27:58,167 --> 01:28:00,959
It's the door at the end.
It's quiet here.

799
01:28:03,876 --> 01:28:05,709
I warn you, it's tiny.

800
01:28:05,834 --> 01:28:08,251
I know what a maid's room
looks like.

801
01:28:58,417 --> 01:29:00,501
The 07 is because of my father.

802
01:29:01,334 --> 01:29:03,959
My parents separated
when I was a kid.

803
01:29:04,084 --> 01:29:06,709
My father's
psychologically unstable.

804
01:29:09,001 --> 01:29:12,001
When I did my coming out,
he freaked.

805
01:29:13,042 --> 01:29:14,792
He'd call me all the time.

806
01:29:16,876 --> 01:29:19,792
Nothing nasty.
He'd just rave on:

807
01:29:19,917 --> 01:29:23,001
fags, the end of the world,
Martians...

808
01:29:23,126 --> 01:29:25,834
It was unbearable.
He called non-stop.

809
01:29:25,959 --> 01:29:28,667
He'd leave hour-long messages.

810
01:29:28,792 --> 01:29:30,501
It couldn't go on.

811
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:35,709
I didn't want
to get the police involved.

812
01:29:35,834 --> 01:29:38,751
Imagine, lodging a complaint
about your dad.

813
01:29:39,792 --> 01:29:43,251
He wasn't threatening me
or being homophobic.

814
01:29:44,667 --> 01:29:46,001
Nothing.

815
01:29:46,834 --> 01:29:48,751
He was just ruining my life.

816
01:29:51,834 --> 01:29:53,751
So I changed numbers.

817
01:29:54,709 --> 01:29:57,251
My mom and half-sisters
changed, too.

818
01:29:58,959 --> 01:30:01,042
We're an 07 family now.

819
01:30:01,167 --> 01:30:02,626
Sometimes I call him,

820
01:30:02,751 --> 01:30:04,126
by Skype!

821
01:30:04,251 --> 01:30:05,917
When I have plenty of time.

822
01:30:56,376 --> 01:30:57,834
You're beautiful.

823
01:31:01,792 --> 01:31:03,626
I like your body.

824
01:31:13,209 --> 01:31:16,501
Behind your ear, it's soft.

825
01:31:20,417 --> 01:31:22,334
Your stubble...

826
01:31:22,459 --> 01:31:24,001
it scratches.

827
01:31:24,792 --> 01:31:26,542
I like how it scratches.

828
01:31:29,792 --> 01:31:32,501
Your neck.

829
01:31:34,042 --> 01:31:35,792
You smell so good.

830
01:31:41,959 --> 01:31:44,501
Your nipples.

831
01:31:49,542 --> 01:31:51,167
Your stomach.

832
01:31:57,876 --> 01:31:59,834
I like your dick.

833
01:32:01,876 --> 01:32:03,709
It's really beautiful.

834
01:32:06,542 --> 01:32:08,917
I don't know how to describe it,

835
01:32:10,542 --> 01:32:12,126
but I like it.

836
01:32:14,209 --> 01:32:16,167
I like looking at it.

837
01:32:18,792 --> 01:32:20,959
I like taking it in my hand.

838
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:29,209
I like kissing it.

839
01:32:34,292 --> 01:32:36,501
Your balls are beautiful, too.

840
01:32:39,459 --> 01:32:41,209
Here, in my hand,

841
01:32:41,334 --> 01:32:43,209
they're delicate.

842
01:32:44,251 --> 01:32:46,126
Yet they have weight.

843
01:32:51,459 --> 01:32:52,917
I kiss them.

844
01:32:55,126 --> 01:32:57,209
They're soft.

845
01:32:57,334 --> 01:32:58,501
So soft.

846
01:32:58,626 --> 01:33:01,501
Sh... Stop it.

847
01:33:03,626 --> 01:33:06,042
Should we make love again today?

848
01:33:06,167 --> 01:33:07,709
I don't think so.

849
01:33:08,501 --> 01:33:09,917
Let's leave it at that.

850
01:33:17,084 --> 01:33:18,417
Time to go.

851
01:33:19,667 --> 01:33:21,667
I'll see you tomorrow.

852
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,917
We can meet up before.

853
01:33:24,042 --> 01:33:25,751
Good idea.

854
01:33:25,876 --> 01:33:27,542
I'll call you.

855
01:33:27,667 --> 01:33:29,042
Or you call me.

856
01:33:29,834 --> 01:33:31,417
Whoever gives in first?

857
01:33:34,542 --> 01:33:35,917
I'm going.

858
01:34:18,876 --> 01:34:20,834
Want to come to my place?

859
01:34:20,959 --> 01:34:23,501
I was leaving
and in the staircase...

860
01:34:24,167 --> 01:34:26,209
I can't leave you like this.

861
01:34:27,334 --> 01:34:30,459
Till tomorrow,
when we go to the hospital.

862
01:34:31,292 --> 01:34:33,709
My place isn't huge, you'll see.
But it's...

863
01:34:35,084 --> 01:34:36,209
a bit more...

864
01:34:36,334 --> 01:34:39,459
- Do I get dressed?
- Uh, yes, get dressed.

865
01:34:42,501 --> 01:34:43,626
Then what?

866
01:34:43,751 --> 01:34:45,167
And then?

867
01:34:45,292 --> 01:34:48,792
You'll take your treatment...
and I'll be there.

868
01:34:49,417 --> 01:34:50,751
For 28 days?

869
01:34:51,501 --> 01:34:53,126
It's not long.

870
01:34:55,167 --> 01:34:56,292
Then what?

871
01:34:58,501 --> 01:35:00,792
You'll do the test

872
01:35:00,917 --> 01:35:02,542
and we'll wait for the result.

873
01:35:04,042 --> 01:35:05,501
And by that time,

874
01:35:06,626 --> 01:35:09,376
after three months
and 28 days together,

875
01:35:09,501 --> 01:35:11,126
we'll be strong enough.

876
01:35:11,959 --> 01:35:14,292
Even if I'm sure
you'll be negative.

877
01:35:15,292 --> 01:35:17,001
After that,

878
01:35:17,876 --> 01:35:19,792
if you still want to have sex,

879
01:35:20,667 --> 01:35:22,376
if you're not scared,

880
01:35:23,292 --> 01:35:24,751
we can keep going.

881
01:35:26,251 --> 01:35:27,542
Then what?

882
01:35:27,667 --> 01:35:29,334
We'll keep going.

883
01:35:29,459 --> 01:35:31,667
There'll be no reason to stop.

884
01:35:32,501 --> 01:35:34,292
We'll stay together.

885
01:35:34,417 --> 01:35:36,001
For a long time.

886
01:35:36,126 --> 01:35:37,959
How long?

887
01:35:38,084 --> 01:35:40,251
A long time. I don't know.

888
01:35:40,376 --> 01:35:43,126
Let's say... 20 years.

889
01:35:43,251 --> 01:35:45,792
In 20 years, we'll do so much.

890
01:35:45,917 --> 01:35:47,542
We'll go...

891
01:35:47,667 --> 01:35:49,584
to the supermarket.

892
01:35:49,709 --> 01:35:51,959
Or maybe something huge.

893
01:35:52,084 --> 01:35:55,334
We'll save whales,
or just a kitten.

894
01:35:55,459 --> 01:35:58,334
A cause,
or a world-changing invention.

895
01:35:58,459 --> 01:36:00,251
I don't know... something.

896
01:36:01,959 --> 01:36:03,334
Then what?

897
01:36:04,209 --> 01:36:05,626
After that...

898
01:36:07,626 --> 01:36:11,084
we'll break up, I guess.

899
01:36:12,709 --> 01:36:14,209
Like everyone else.

900
01:36:15,626 --> 01:36:18,501
And we'll be sad
but that's life.

901
01:36:19,667 --> 01:36:21,251
You're sure it's worth it?

902
01:36:28,292 --> 01:36:31,126
Breakfast?
Something sweet this time?

903
01:37:13,834 --> 01:37:15,292
Wait, I forgot my phone.

904
01:37:15,417 --> 01:37:17,959
You're with me.
Who would you call?

905
01:37:18,084 --> 01:37:19,501
Even so...

906
01:37:20,417 --> 01:37:23,167
If you go back, I'll leave.

907
01:37:23,292 --> 01:37:25,459
- It's over.
- You mean it?

908
01:37:28,084 --> 01:37:29,751
I mean it.

909
01:37:30,626 --> 01:37:32,792
If you turn back,

910
01:37:32,917 --> 01:37:35,084
if you look behind you,

911
01:37:35,209 --> 01:37:37,376
you lose it all.

912
01:37:37,501 --> 01:37:39,084
Everything I promised.

913
01:37:45,542 --> 01:37:47,001
Let's go forward.

914
01:37:48,251 --> 01:37:49,709
We're not afraid.

915
01:37:52,376 --> 01:37:56,126
Can I use your phone to call
my mum? I call every Sunday.

916
01:37:58,834 --> 01:38:01,042
Keep it until Monday night.

917
01:38:01,167 --> 01:38:02,542
Wait.

918
01:38:02,667 --> 01:38:03,834
Look.

919
01:38:07,209 --> 01:38:08,501
See?

920
01:38:09,292 --> 01:38:11,417
This is when it all starts.
