to your step-dad!

- Uh, he runs Slam
FM, the biggest radio
station in Seattle.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.747
Maybe he could give
you an internship.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.791
That'd be a confidence
booster right?

He's been married to my
Mom for what? 2 months?

01:25.085 --> 01:27.880
He probably thinks I'm
a total step-freak.

01:27.880 --> 01:33.093
I freak out when he asks
what kind of cereal I want.
- Mmhmm.

could talk to
everyone the way I
talk to you.

yet about her identity...

02:10.589 --> 02:12.132
She goes to our school.

02:12.132 --> 02:15.344

much Larry?

02:17.137 --> 02:23.394

It's like a triangle!

status quo when the status
quo is... status quo?

her love does that make
her love any less real?
