1
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:18,476
Summer vacation.

2
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:22,689
I stocked up on Butamen instant noodles.

3
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,651
What am I gonna do
until school starts again?

4
00:00:51,426 --> 00:00:53,428
I might get cursed.

5
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,221
What? How come?

6
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:59,434
Because I saw some kid's ghost here.

7
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,020
What?! Right before we tear it down?

8
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,897
- Look!
- Huh?!

9
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,984
Anyway, what should I have for lunch?

10
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,820
What?! Were you just messing with me?!

11
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,280
I heard our manager saw it.

12
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:15,283
Really?! But this is the first demo site
I've been assigned to.

13
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:16,659
Lucky you.

14
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:28,713
Grandpa Yasuji.

15
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:36,096
<i>The Kamonomiya apartment complex
was built some 60 years ago.</i>

16
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:41,059
<i>Some call it the haunted apartments,
but we called it home.</i>

17
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:45,605
<i>It was Natsume's and my cherished home.</i>

18
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,743
NATSUME:
LET'S VISIT GRANDPA YASUJI TOMORROW!

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,755
KOSUKE:
SORRY

20
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,007
{\an8}LET'S GO NEXT TIME FOR SURE!

21
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,759
COME TO SOCCER CLUB.
I WANT A REPLY!

22
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,886
READ

23
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,054
KOSUKE: NATSUME?

24
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,389
{\an8}KOSUKE: TOTALLY BUMMED!

25
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:22,767
{\an8}VOICE CALL

26
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,023
{\an8}Kosuke!

27
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,817
Dinner's ready!

28
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,867
What are you doing?!

29
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,723
Finish your summer assignments early
if you want to enjoy

30
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,059
the last summer break
of elementary school!

31
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:30,561
But don't get hurt doing anything silly.

32
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,690
I'll see you at the summer festival.
Take care!

33
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,777
All rise! Attention! Bow! Goodbye!

34
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,028
Natsume, are you okay?

35
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,531
I'm fine, I'm fine! See you, bye-bye!

36
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,199
Bye-bye!

37
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,287
Kumagaya! Huh?!

38
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,041
Reina, sorry!

39
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,043
Reina! Are you okay?

40
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,504
Are you all right?

41
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,299
- What's wrong with you?! That hurt!
- Sorry.

42
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,550
Natsume, look!

43
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:03,136
- What?
- Didn't you make that in art class?

44
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,220
What's that garbage?

45
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:05,388
Reina!

46
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,598
No problem. It's fine, it's fine!

47
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,727
I'm here to see Kumagaya, not you.

48
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,895
Kumagaya!

49
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:17,275
I'm going to Florida in two days,
but we have one extra seat.

50
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,484
Huh?

51
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:23,197
You mind if I borrow Kumagaya?

52
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:25,533
You don't have to ask me.

53
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,703
He's all yours.

54
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:33,791
We're going to a theme park in Florida.
If you'd like to join us...

55
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,084
There you are, Natsume!

56
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:37,837
We're going to the haunted apartments
tomorrow!

57
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,298
What? Why?

58
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:44,469
The summer-break research project!
The details are secret!

59
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,764
Hey, you'll come too, right, Kosuke?!

60
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,309
Back off! I'm talking to Kumagaya here!

61
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,268
What?!

62
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:55,855
The Kamo Elementary School Soccer Club
is all-in-one and one-in-all!

63
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,232
- What?
- You mean all for one, and one for all?

64
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,026
Shut up, you runt!

65
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,569
You're a runt too!

66
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,364
You're the last person
I wanna hear that from!

67
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:05,656
Those apartments...!

68
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,703
Don't go there. It's dangerous.
They're tearing them down.

69
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,372
Yeah, but...

70
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:13,831
She's right, Taishi.

71
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:14,915
We can still go!

72
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:17,043
See? Kumagaya should come with me to...

73
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:21,297
Jeez! You guys never shut up.
I ain't going with either of you!

74
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,635
Hold up! Kosuke!

75
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,636
See ya!

76
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,970
What? Kumagaya!

77
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,473
- No running in the hallway!
- Yes, sir.

78
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,644
Stupid boys!

79
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:37,522
What?

80
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,442
I wish Natsume would
come back to the club.

81
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,946
We got a practice game
with Naka Elementary next week!

82
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,989
You guys are our forwards
and our brothers!

83
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,866
We're not brothers.

84
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,745
The haunted apartments!
There's a ghost there!

85
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:54,914
- Everyone says so!
- Hey, Taishi!

86
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:57,041
Kosuke and Natsume used to live there!

87
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,126
Hey.

88
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:03,548
You guys wanna play
<i>Super Smash Bros.</i> at our new place?

89
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:04,841
Sure.

90
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:09,595
Last one there gets the crappy controller!

91
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:12,723
No way! I want the pro controller!

92
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,559
- I don't want the crappy one!
- Wait up!

93
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,230
I'm home!

94
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,816
Oh, Natsume.

95
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,446
I know. The place is a mess.

96
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:27,947
Jeez.

97
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,532
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,368
I wanted to make you proud by DIYing it,

99
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,954
but I don't have the energy
after working from home.

100
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:36,873
Why don't you start jogging?

101
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,916
I'll think about it.

102
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,085
By the way,

103
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,381
did they tear down
that apartment complex yet?

104
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,217
Who knows? I sure don't.

105
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:51,846
Oh. But it's kind of sad.

106
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:58,352
You spent a lot of time there
with Yasuko and Mr. Yasuji too.

107
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,314
I wish I could've properly thanked them.

108
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,151
Here you are!

109
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,444
Come on!

110
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,237
Clean up the rest yourself.

111
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:11,365
Looks like it's takeout again tonight.

112
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:14,660
Maybe I'll get the sukiyaki rice bowl
from Gusto again.

113
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:18,414
Here's the sukiyaki, Grandpa's favorite.

114
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,958
Come on, get going!

115
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,002
What a pain.

116
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,680
How's Natsume doing lately?

117
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:36,390
No idea.

118
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:41,938
You two were practically inseparable!

119
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,273
And Satoko? That was just like her.

120
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,277
The moment she returned,
she took Natsume back with barely a word.

121
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:52,865
It's so dreary without her,
and you're so cold.

122
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,409
- Thanks for dinner.
- You're finished already?

123
00:08:56,744 --> 00:09:00,164
You didn't eat your shiitake again!

124
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,707
{\an8}VOICE CALL
VIDEO CALL

125
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,668
{\an8}NATSUME

126
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,215
{\an8}<i>We're going to the haunted apartments
tomorrow!</i>

127
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:12,885
{\an8}<i>Seriously?! Don't tell me
the research project's about...</i>

128
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:17,181
<i>I wonder...
You'll find out when we get there!</i>

129
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,938
{\an8}KOSUKE:
I'M NOT GOING

130
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,068
What's taking them so long?

131
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,570
Kosuke!

132
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,990
Hey!

133
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:34,949
What are we doing?

134
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,867
{\an8}Operation Ghost Trap!

135
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:37,952
{\an8}CONSTRUCTION
KEEP OUT

136
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:41,414
{\an8}- He says we're gonna catch and study it.
- It's our research project!

137
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:43,833
{\an8}Just humor him, Kosuke.

138
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,209
{\an8}What the heck?

139
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,005
- Let's go, you guys!
- Okay!

140
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,802
Why use these?

141
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:56,887
- Why not smartphones?
- <i>Okay over there?!</i>

142
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:58,014
Who's there?!

143
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,726
Hey, don't do this to me. Please don't.

144
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:09,817
Jeez, this is all his fault!
This really sucks.

145
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,362
Over here!

146
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,948
Taishi, you idiot! What are you doing?

147
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:17,825
Whoa! Ow!

148
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,790
Nope, this one's sealed shut too.

149
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,000
What?!

150
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,754
There's Kosuke's old apartment.

151
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,257
Hey! Over here!

152
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,968
I bet this is the one!

153
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:38,638
- Hey, let's go. We're never gonna...
- Whoa!

154
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:42,558
It opened! Awesome!
I bet there's a ghost in here!

155
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,311
<i>Ghostbusters!</i>

156
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,313
Are you gonna get rid of it?

157
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,397
It won't open!

158
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,358
Of course it's locked.

159
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,275
It opened!

160
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:53,402
- What?
- Seriously?!

161
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,782
Hey, Taishi! Take off your shoes!

162
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,741
Wow!

163
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,409
- Oh, Kosuke...
- Awesome!

164
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,204
Taishi went inside with his shoes on!

165
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:04,372
YASUJI, TOYOKO KUMAGAYA

166
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,248
Where are you?!

167
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,794
Who cares? I don't live here anymore.

168
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:12,213
You there?! Come out!

169
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:17,093
Pardon our intrusion.

170
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:22,181
Where are you?! Show yourself!

171
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:24,600
Your unit was
above this one, right, Kosuke?

172
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,937
- Yeah.
- So this one's your grandpa's.

173
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,815
Hey, knock it off!

174
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,108
Let's go!

175
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,694
I know you're here!

176
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,533
What's wrong, Taishi?

177
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,789
It's a ghost.

178
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:48,874
Huh?

179
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,584
That's Natsume.

180
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,005
- Let's go.
- What?

181
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,841
Natsume!

182
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,217
Shut up, you idiot!

183
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,136
What about our soccer game?!

184
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,219
What?

185
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,139
Noppo?

186
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,181
- Noppo?
- Noppo?

187
00:12:10,062 --> 00:12:12,398
What are you guys doing here?

188
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,735
That's what <i>we'd</i> like to ask <i>you!</i>

189
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,154
I was just taking a nap.

190
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,322
We can see that.

191
00:12:21,198 --> 00:12:22,491
But why here?

192
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,911
And who's Noppo?

193
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:29,707
Taishi, Yuzuru. I'm sorry
I can't go to soccer club.

194
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:33,169
So you came to join us
too, Natsume?! All-in-one?!

195
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,962
You mean "all for one."

196
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:38,674
No, I'm here
because Noppo's always upstairs.

197
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:40,801
It's up here.

198
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:43,762
See?

199
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,933
You can go up there? How'd you open it?!

200
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:49,185
It was already open.

201
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:51,395
It must be fate!

202
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,274
Noppo, are you there?

203
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,526
Awesome!

204
00:12:58,903 --> 00:13:00,446
We're pretty high up.

205
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,033
Taishi, be careful you don't fall.

206
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,744
There's a tent! Natsume, are you camping?!

207
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,245
Well, something like that.

208
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,413
Really?

209
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,583
Noppo's always here,
so I set it up for him.

210
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,794
Awesome!

211
00:13:16,045 --> 00:13:18,714
So, who's this Noppo?

212
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:21,467
He said he used to live
in this apartment complex.

213
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,885
Can I go in the tent?!

214
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,303
Sure!

215
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,554
Is he our age?

216
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,723
Yeah, but he's really tall.

217
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:29,725
That's why he's called Noppo?

218
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,436
Exactly! He won't tell me his real name,

219
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,730
and it doesn't seem
like he wants to go home.

220
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:37,983
Maybe he's the ghost.

221
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,112
What? He's not a ghost.

222
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,616
So, where is he?

223
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,784
What?

224
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,623
You're just making excuses
because you want to be here.

225
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,628
I bet you were the one
who unlocked the door to get in here.

226
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,382
Even so, I couldn't just ignore him.

227
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,008
Don't lie.

228
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,510
I'm not!

229
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:07,054
{\an8}Once you've been
to an American theme park,

230
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:10,266
{\an8}there's no going back to a Japanese one.

231
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,601
I'm on the first flight tomorrow,

232
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,354
so let me know now
if you want any souvenirs!

233
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,856
Hey, look!

234
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,356
There's a tent!

235
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,859
Aren't they from our class?

236
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,527
That's the haunted apartments.

237
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,279
Why would they play there?

238
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,241
Boys are such Neanderthals.
They are all idiots.

239
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,159
Come on, let's go.

240
00:14:29,743 --> 00:14:30,786
It's Kumagaya.

241
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,038
What? Where?!

242
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,542
I don't see him anywhere.

243
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,335
Where is he?

244
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,419
Reina.

245
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,755
The early bird gets the worm.

246
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,925
- Answer when opportunity knocks!
- What?

247
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,803
My sister says that about boys.

248
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:49,930
No, it's not like that.

249
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:53,267
I'm just annoyed
because he ignored me yesterday!

250
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,269
I'll go give him a piece of my mind.

251
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,438
What? You're going <i>there?</i>

252
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,814
Don't!

253
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,525
Wait, Reina!

254
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,444
I'll find him in no time!

255
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:06,322
You're obsessed with this place.

256
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,824
It's not like that.

257
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:12,328
- Let's take it down a notch, okay?
- You don't even come to the club.

258
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,415
You're not finished cleaning up?
Stop lying! It's been two months!

259
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:17,958
It's not a lie! My mom's...

260
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,376
It's the runt!

261
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,630
Shut it. My business
is with Kumagaya, not you.

262
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:23,714
Natsume?

263
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,175
It's their usual marital spat.

264
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,802
Kosuke's yelling at her,
saying she should stay out of here.

265
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,888
She's causing trouble again.

266
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,348
You're the one who's lying!

267
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,683
Then again, we're here too, so...

268
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,644
Try me. You'll just lie again.

269
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:39,146
Natsume! Enough already!

270
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,651
- It's none of your business.
- You're bothering Kumagaya!

271
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,736
You shouldn't even be here!

272
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:48,697
What is this anyway?

273
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,616
Don't touch that!

274
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,493
What's your problem?!

275
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:56,205
You're playing with this old junk?

276
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,498
No! Give it back!

277
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:02,836
Hey, let go of me!

278
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,254
I said give it back!

279
00:16:05,756 --> 00:16:07,132
That hurt.

280
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,093
Reina!

281
00:16:10,219 --> 00:16:11,720
Are you okay?

282
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,640
I'm gonna tell the teacher and my dad too!

283
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:29,196
This is Grandpa's, isn't it?

284
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,533
That is...

285
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:34,493
I was looking for this.

286
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:39,039
What are you doing
stealing other people's stuff?

287
00:16:40,374 --> 00:16:41,374
No.

288
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,669
I'm taking it back.

289
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,422
Wait.

290
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:51,427
Grandpa kicked the bucket,
but you're still barging into our home.

291
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,304
{\an8}You make me sick!

292
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,101
I see.

293
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,563
So that's how it's gonna be?

294
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:05,024
What do you mean?

295
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,444
We always played together
and lived together for so long.

296
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,071
{\an8}I can't believe you said that!

297
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:14,783
{\an8}You have nothing to do with my family!

298
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,993
{\an8}You're an idiot!

299
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,040
Crap! Stop!

300
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,123
Natsume?!

301
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,378
I said stop!

302
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,382
Hey!

303
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:33,135
Stop it!

304
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,387
- Natsume!
- Natsume, that's dangerous!

305
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:36,847
Get down from there!

306
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,307
Stay away! Leave me alone!

307
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,059
Get down here!

308
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,312
No! Don't come up!

309
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,328
Give me your other hand!

310
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:05,102
Natsume!

311
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,687
Natsume!

312
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,855
There she is!

313
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,773
Natsume!

314
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,485
- Natsume!
- Natsume!

315
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,492
Natsume, are you all right?!

316
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,165
Natsume!

317
00:19:27,124 --> 00:19:28,333
You okay?

318
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,501
Yeah, I'm fine.

319
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:31,128
Thank goodness.

320
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,381
No way.

321
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,514
There's nothing there!

322
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,057
You mean we're floating?

323
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,225
That's salty!

324
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,644
The town vanished in an instant!

325
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:51,648
Yeah, right! We probably just got
washed away by that downpour.

326
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,817
Then we're the only ones who survived?

327
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,943
No way.

328
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,403
Kumagaya!

329
00:19:56,486 --> 00:19:58,530
There's a ship approaching!

330
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,532
- What?!
- Seriously?!

331
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:04,369
This is insane!
Is this some kind of drill?!

332
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,913
They've come to our rescue!

333
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:06,872
Hurry!

334
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,540
- Oh! Don't push!
- Hurry up!

335
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:10,292
- That hurts!
- You idiot!

336
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,544
- You're too heavy!
- Ouch!

337
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,554
Whoa, that's way too close!

338
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,806
- Hey!
- Hey!

339
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,059
- Help us!
- What is this?! Wait!

340
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,852
- Wait!
- Don't go!

341
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,812
Don't ignore me! Hey!

342
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,897
It's leaving!

343
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:34,775
Hey, we're right here!

344
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,527
Wait for us!

345
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,572
Taishi!

346
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,828
There it goes.

347
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,961
No signal?!

348
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:55,712
{\an8}Why is this happening?

349
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,714
I can't connect with this either.

350
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:00,467
Any way you slice it,
we're in the middle of the ocean.

351
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,970
Is this even Japan?

352
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,554
A drifting home!

353
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,473
- What?
- How's that possible?

354
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:11,103
This is your fault!
What are you gonna do about it?!

355
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:12,604
What?

356
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,315
It's all because you were here
in the first place!

357
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,402
- I didn't know this would happen.
- Liar!

358
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,361
Reina.

359
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:21,029
I was just...

360
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,114
Just what?!

361
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:23,490
...here because of Noppo.

362
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,118
Who? There's nobody but us here!

363
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,786
You're such a liar!

364
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,621
I'm not lying!

365
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,332
Then let's see him!

366
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:36,295
Cut it out! We should be
figuring this out, not arguing.

367
00:21:36,378 --> 00:21:38,505
Well then, what should we do?

368
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:41,800
Natsume, you've been here awhile.

369
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:44,344
Don't you know anything about this place?

370
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,390
Well, not really.

371
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,268
I don't know.

372
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,937
I don't trust her.

373
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,022
Wait.

374
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:59,026
The room downstairs
might have some food. I'll go look.

375
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:01,778
I don't trust her.

376
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,839
Is it really my fault?

377
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:28,138
- Pea pod crisps!
- Her project's fixed.

378
00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:30,557
What was she doing here?

379
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,184
She said she was camping.

380
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,310
What a Neanderthal.

381
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,437
- Is it okay to eat this?
- Kumagaya?

382
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,938
- After we ask Natsume.
- Hey!

383
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:38,148
Come on!

384
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:39,941
I don't get it.

385
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,485
Wanna drink some of this?

386
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:42,694
What's her problem?

387
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,572
When someone's worried about you,

388
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,784
you should tell them what's wrong
instead of running away.

389
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,120
Hey, I know!

390
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:55,832
This must be a prank,
so there's no point worrying about it!

391
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:56,916
- What?
- A prank?

392
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,460
I seriously doubt it.

393
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:02,297
The ship we saw
was probably keeping an eye on us.

394
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,382
That explains it!

395
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:07,094
If that's what they want,
let's enjoy this as much as we can!

396
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,053
That's true!

397
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,304
Right, Kumagaya?

398
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,807
There's no way this is a prank!

399
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,101
This is some kind of freak accident!

400
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,520
But we'll get back home no matter what!

401
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:19,106
But how, Kumagaya?

402
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,360
Don't worry about it. Just leave it to me!

403
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,364
Kumagaya.

404
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,617
You said, "Leave it to me."

405
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,120
<i>Our SOS signal,</i>

406
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,122
<i>our walkie-talkie,</i>

407
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,748
<i>our fireworks,</i>

408
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,210
<i>and our endless searches with binoculars,</i>

409
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,504
they all failed.

410
00:23:42,587 --> 00:23:45,173
Worst-case scenario,
we build a raft and escape...

411
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,008
No way I'm doing that!

412
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:50,929
That's even more dangerous than this
if we don't reach land!

413
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,514
That's true.

414
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:57,227
I can't take it anymore!
I'm all sweaty, and there's no shower!

415
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,520
And I have to pee.

416
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,980
Just go in the ocean.

417
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:01,898
No way in hell!

418
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:06,027
What's she doing anyway?!
This is all her fault!

419
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,488
Reina, calm down!

420
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:14,786
Whoa, it's so dark!

421
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,914
Kumagaya, where are you going?

422
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,375
Room 101. It was pretty clean.

423
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:22,294
What about Natsume?

424
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,504
She'll be fine!

425
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:27,007
- Reina...
- Someone's there.

426
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,967
Oh, I bet it's just her.

427
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,927
What're you doing in there?

428
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,443
Don't go.

429
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:48,653
- Reina, hurry!
- I am!

430
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:54,534
Wait for me!

431
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,919
There really is a ghost here!
This isn't a prank!

432
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,463
He probably brought us here!

433
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,465
Open up.

434
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,967
He's gonna murder us!

435
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,518
I'm too young to die!

436
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,561
Me too!

437
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,565
Hey! There's a light up there!

438
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,695
What is this?! Some kinda evil ritual?!

439
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,322
We're trapped!

440
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,453
- He's here!
- He's here!

441
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,579
Whoa!

442
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,333
Natsume? What are you doing?

443
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,877
You found me already? Where's Noppo?

444
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,796
Wait up.

445
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,423
Kumagaya, help me.

446
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,221
Don't go.

447
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,314
This is Noppo.
He says he used to live here.

448
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,941
He really does exist.

449
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,526
He's even taller than Yuzuru.

450
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:12,821
- I bet you're really in middle school.
- Which one?! You in a club?!

451
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,072
Forget about that!

452
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:16,157
{\an8}You have any food?

453
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:17,784
{\an8}What is that anyway?

454
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:21,746
{\an8}It's oil from the demo site.
We'll need it at night, won't we?

455
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,291
{\an8}I thought it was some evil ritual.

456
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,501
{\an8}It's pretty and puts my mind at ease.

457
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,587
There's food too.

458
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,297
Butamen jackpot!

459
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,965
Lots of snacks too!

460
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,174
Drinks too.

461
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,258
Water jackpot!

462
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,468
Cola too!

463
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,970
You brought all of this?

464
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,389
But that won't be enough,

465
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:43,351
so I was boiling rainwater
with this stove Noppo made.

466
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,644
That's disgusting.

467
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,104
You can wash off too.

468
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,523
Like a shower?! I can take one?

469
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,861
Washing with seawater
and rinsing with freshwater's not so bad.

470
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,280
Noppo and Natsume, you guys are amazing!

471
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:56,698
We'll live here!

472
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,867
- What? No way!
- Cola!

473
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:00,493
Listen, everyone.

474
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:01,620
What?

475
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,207
Actually, I've been here before.

476
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:10,086
You've been here? Like on a ship?

477
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,838
No, in this building.

478
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:17,135
I was here when I suddenly found myself
out to sea a few times.

479
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,013
Why didn't you tell us?

480
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:23,224
{\an8}Sorry. I couldn't bring myself to say it.

481
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:27,479
{\an8}But don't worry.
I'm always back home when I wake up.

482
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,522
{\an8}This must be a dream!

483
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,692
- What?!
- Seriously? But it's so real.

484
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,152
That's just dumb!

485
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,320
It'll be all right.

486
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:39,032
Even after a whole night here,
no time had passed back home.

487
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,533
Yeah? Then we'll be fine!

488
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,995
It sounds crazy,
but if you say so, Natsume, I believe you!

489
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,080
No way!

490
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,665
I believe you too, Natsume!

491
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,041
What?

492
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,043
It's a one-night camp!

493
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,337
Sounds exciting when you say it like that!

494
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:53,922
Boys are so stupid!

495
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:57,801
Kosuke?

496
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,512
There's no way this is a dream.

497
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:04,683
I bet you're delusional
from holing up here too long.

498
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,770
Kosuke, don't be such a jerk.

499
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,438
Can't you guys make up?

500
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,648
That's not the issue!

501
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:15,819
We should do something,
not talk about all this stupid stuff!

502
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:17,195
Like what?

503
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,115
I'll be the lookout upstairs.

504
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:24,577
Help <i>will</i> come.
Getting back home comes first!

505
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:27,997
Jeez.

506
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:31,292
He's gone. I wanted to play cards.

507
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,461
Hey, where's the bathroom?

508
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,101
No way.

509
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,146
This really is real?

510
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:53,606
I dreamed I was eating at McDonald's.

511
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,761
BUTAMEN INSTANT NOODLES

512
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,393
This is the first time
I've felt hungry in a dream.

513
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,395
Reina?

514
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,981
How can this be a dream?

515
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,150
We're still here when we wake up.

516
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:22,654
Our phones won't connect.
I'm hungry, but there's nothing to eat.

517
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:25,657
We're just waiting to die.

518
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,991
I'm sorry.

519
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,954
I'm sure we'll get home soon.

520
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:34,958
I hate that fake smile of yours.

521
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,501
Reina!

522
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:42,465
Natsume, wait!

523
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,144
Kosuke.

524
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,362
Here. But there's not much left.

525
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:08,157
Oh, it's you.
I'm not hungry, so I don't need...

526
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:13,496
What's that?

527
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:16,499
I've come up with some ideas.

528
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,627
I'd like to hear them.

529
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:23,131
Well, maybe just a bit.

530
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:28,136
In the past four days, we've seen
other buildings drifting like ours.

531
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:32,473
Who knows when we'll get back,
so we'll need food for the long haul.

532
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,144
If we can't even catch fish,
we gotta go stock up.

533
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,898
The next time that building passes by,
I'll jump onto it with this!

534
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,944
With this rope?

535
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:47,113
I tied one end
to the roof's electrical cable

536
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:49,198
and the other end to a piece of antenna.

537
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,659
I'll use it like a grappling hook
and make a zip line.

538
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,620
Kosuke, that's amazing.

539
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:56,331
Not really. I'm actually scared.

540
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,625
What?

541
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,464
Kosuke, come join us. Everyone's waiting.

542
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:07,425
Like I'd really go back there now.

543
00:32:08,259 --> 00:32:11,346
Natsume's doing the best she can.

544
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,597
Natsume?

545
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,099
She's worried.

546
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,562
She won't say it,
but she's waiting for you. She's...

547
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,522
Stop talking about Natsume.

548
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:24,108
How do you know so much about her?

549
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:29,197
Even I don't understand her.

550
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,826
I know she needs you, Kosuke.

551
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,578
Who are you to say that?!

552
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:37,163
Hey!

553
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,219
{\an8}BUTAMEN INSTANT NOODLES
GREEN TEA

554
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:24,419
Isn't that...?

555
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,551
Whoa!

556
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,806
Dang it.

557
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,606
Yes!

558
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:52,571
What the...?!

559
00:33:58,161 --> 00:33:59,287
Kosuke.

560
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:10,423
Here goes!

561
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,694
Ouch!

562
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,621
This really is Narahara's indoor pool.

563
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,889
What was that?

564
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,780
What are you doing?

565
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,698
Why are you...

566
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:21,035
You jerk! You made
that big noise on purpose!

567
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,787
What are you talking about?

568
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:23,913
Huh?

569
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:27,333
Whatever. You came to Narahara
to find food, right?

570
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,044
Yeah. But why'd you have to follow me?

571
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,839
I'd be worried if you were alone.

572
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:36,134
I'll help, so quit peeking
into the changing room. Hurry!

573
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,886
What?! This is the boys' changing room!

574
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:39,970
Wait up!

575
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,433
I remember these photos.
Maybe the other rooms stayed the same!

576
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,437
This way!

577
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,439
Find anything?

578
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,523
Not yet.

579
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:54,443
There might be some emergency rations.

580
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,362
How's this possible?

581
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:59,407
Narahara was torn down
when we were in third grade.

582
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:01,159
Forget about that! Just look!

583
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,704
I know! But it's only natural
to wonder about this.

584
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,540
You're gonna do that now?

585
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,833
I can't help it!

586
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:13,963
Look who's hungry now!

587
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,591
I just remembered something!

588
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,593
There were vending machines upstairs!

589
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,676
Right!

590
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,762
We gotta hurry!

591
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,306
Found 'em!

592
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:25,600
Really?!

593
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,228
Whoa! Hey, that's dangerous!

594
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,732
It's fine! See?

595
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,359
Kosuke, get over here.

596
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,486
I said that's dangerous!

597
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:43,576
Natsume!

598
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,080
You okay?!

599
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,585
I'm... fine.

600
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:56,088
What do you mean you're fine? Hang on.

601
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:04,096
I'm the one who said it was a dream,
but this really hurts.

602
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:08,643
This has gotta be real!
That's why I warned, you idiot!

603
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:09,852
Idiot?

604
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,771
Okay. All done.

605
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,484
What a waste of time. We gotta hurry.

606
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:21,822
- Kosuke.
- Just wait right there!

607
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,242
Darn it.

608
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:34,252
Jeez, I would've been
better off on my own.

609
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:39,257
You always dash ahead
and end up getting hurt during our games.

610
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:45,263
You may score more points than me,
but an injured player is a useless idiot!

611
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:48,641
Don't say that!

612
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:50,142
Hey, I said wait!

613
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:52,812
We're the two forwards
in our two-forward formation!

614
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,356
But you're a wimp!
You can't take a shot on your own!

615
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:58,567
Shut up! I'm perfectly fine without you!

616
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:02,196
I came here to help,
and that's all you can say?!

617
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,448
- Be quiet!
- This is nothing!

618
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,992
Just leave it to me!

619
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,910
This is why I can't leave you alone.

620
00:38:07,994 --> 00:38:09,996
I can do it myself!

621
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,751
See? This is where
we have to cooperate, you little brat!

622
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:18,254
Stop acting like a big sister!
I can do it!

623
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:22,174
You can do what? You're a little brat
who can't understand how others feel!

624
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,011
Only a little brat
would hole up in that apartment!

625
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:28,014
I was worried about you too!

626
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,599
Mind your own business!

627
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:31,809
That's my line!

628
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,019
Just forget it.

629
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,687
- Let's do this!
- Let's do this!

630
00:38:40,943 --> 00:38:42,862
It's no use. Dang it.

631
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:45,614
Kosuke!

632
00:38:45,698 --> 00:38:47,033
Natsume!

633
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,701
Natsume!

634
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:50,786
- It's the guys.
- Hurry up!

635
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,830
Hurry up and get back here!

636
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:55,041
You're drifting away!

637
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:03,507
Time's up! We won't be able to get back!

638
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:04,717
No!

639
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,093
Natsume!

640
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:09,263
Everyone's gonna...

641
00:39:12,558 --> 00:39:16,062
Don't worry. We'll get some food somehow.

642
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:17,604
Okay?

643
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,857
Let's get back to the apartment!

644
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,241
You don't have to tell me that.

645
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:31,160
I know!

646
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:32,411
Cut it out!

647
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:34,455
Jeez, just when I'm trying to...

648
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,503
Somebody there?

649
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,586
What?

650
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,882
EMERGENCY PROVISIONS (FOOD)

651
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,641
Natsume!

652
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,976
Kosuke!

653
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,437
Use that rope to get back!

654
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:08,447
Kumagaya, are you okay? Did you get hurt?

655
00:40:10,282 --> 00:40:12,701
NARAHARA
INDOOR POOL

656
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,798
Wow, awesome!

657
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,966
What's all this?!

658
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,342
It's a huge haul!

659
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,844
It looks so good!

660
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:32,178
Open 'em up!

661
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,806
How did you guys get this?

662
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,723
Well...

663
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,600
Rice jackpot!

664
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,102
It's almost expired.

665
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:41,647
This one's expired,
but I'm sure it's still okay!

666
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:44,442
Little runt, you test it out.

667
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,443
- What?!
- Reina!

668
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:48,112
- Hey, wasn't that Narahara?
- Yeah.

669
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:50,739
Wasn't it gone by the time
we were in fourth grade?

670
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,658
Did it get washed away too?

671
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,871
Natsume, is your leg okay? It's bleeding.

672
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,876
I took a little spill,
but I'm fine, I'm fine!

673
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,255
That's a relief. Natsume, you're so cool.

674
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:09,133
You have guts! Right, Reina?

675
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,844
What? Don't ask me!

676
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,472
I bet Kumagaya did all the work!

677
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,056
No, I...

678
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,975
Yeah, it's thanks to Kosuke.

679
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,895
So then you two made up!

680
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:23,230
No, this isn't
about making up or anything,

681
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,607
Kosuke.

682
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,900
Kumagaya!

683
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:29,862
Kumagaya, come over here.
Just forget about her.

684
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,113
Reina!

685
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:34,116
Natsume, it's fine with you, right?

686
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:38,120
Kosuke, stay here with us.

687
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,874
Well, okay.

688
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:46,337
Oh yeah! Kosuke, we made a huge discovery!

689
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:50,341
We just found it!
You can see it, can't you?

690
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,845
You're right. I can see
the water towers. It's our town!

691
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:55,763
Right?!

692
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:56,846
Seriously?!

693
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,099
We can get home.

694
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,769
Definitely, if we keep drifting that way!

695
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,270
All right!

696
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,731
Whoa! We're gonna fall!

697
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,734
What's wrong with you?

698
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,152
I can't breathe!

699
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,321
Doesn't Kumagaya kind of stink?

700
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:13,280
What?

701
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,699
- The town didn't vanish.
- I hope my parents aren't mad.

702
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,785
Let's hurry back and ease their minds.

703
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,709
Kosuke!

704
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:34,802
What?

705
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,639
Kosuke, here.

706
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:39,932
Why are you...

707
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:42,810
This was for you from Grandpa Yasuji.

708
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:44,853
What?

709
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:50,734
We were talking about
making your birthday present a surprise.

710
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:55,114
My birthday? You mean that day?

711
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,577
Yeah, you've always wanted one, right?

712
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:02,621
You planned this together?

713
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,876
It was supposed to become
a precious memory for you,

714
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:11,338
but I got in between you two.

715
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,507
I'm not even family.

716
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,467
I'm sorry.

717
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:18,512
{\an8}Don't apologize.

718
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:19,722
{\an8}What?

719
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:23,017
{\an8}I'm the one who...

720
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,854
That time...

721
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:29,273
Kosuke?

722
00:43:29,356 --> 00:43:31,692
Forget it! It's nothing!

723
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,235
Hey, wait!

724
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,279
You're supposed to accept this!

725
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,905
Wait up, Kosuke!

726
00:45:04,868 --> 00:45:06,286
AT SEA FOR 9 DAYS

727
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,830
NATSUME: AGE 11
KOSUKE: AGE 11

728
00:45:07,913 --> 00:45:08,789
What?

729
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:12,167
You were always together.
Aren't you gonna sleep with Natsume?

730
00:45:12,251 --> 00:45:14,795
We were just little kids!

731
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:17,339
Kumagaya, where are you sleeping?

732
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,423
Still thinking.

733
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:20,467
Then, just sleep here.

734
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,219
I'm gonna go take a leak.

735
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:25,180
Hey, close the door.

736
00:45:32,229 --> 00:45:33,397
What's wrong?

737
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,193
I gotta take a leak!

738
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:39,319
Oh.

739
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:49,830
Never thought I'd have to eat weeds.

740
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:53,083
How long do we have to
eat these tiny portions?

741
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:57,171
- Reina, it's better safe than sorry.
- What?

742
00:45:57,254 --> 00:45:59,339
You mean "better not play with fire"?

743
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,676
What the heck's that?
Don't they mean the same thing?

744
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:05,846
Noppo. Who or what are you?

745
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,056
What do you mean, Kosuke?

746
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,058
I saw your arm yesterday.

747
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:13,353
- Something was growing on it.
- Growing?

748
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,314
You said you used to lived here.

749
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:20,652
But I lived here too,
so I would've known if you were here.

750
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,863
Especially with your height
and those shorts.

751
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,783
Kosuke, you shouldn't talk
about people's looks.

752
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:28,535
I've always been here.

753
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,620
Always?

754
00:46:30,162 --> 00:46:32,873
Ever since they built it.

755
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:38,170
Lots of people came to live here,
babies were born,

756
00:46:38,670 --> 00:46:40,881
and the place was always filled with kids.

757
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:43,717
But everyone's gone now.

758
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,761
But I'm still here.

759
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,138
I don't understand what you're saying.

760
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,807
How old are you if...

761
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:57,314
He's a half-plant half-human monster!

762
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:01,276
That's right, he's a ghost!
Noppo is the apartment's ghost!

763
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:02,361
No way.

764
00:47:02,444 --> 00:47:04,446
- Reina!
- Don't murder us!

765
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,949
Dang it!

766
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:10,035
I don't know if you're a ghost or not,

767
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,496
but you know what's going on, right?!

768
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:15,624
Why are we drifting in the ocean?!

769
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:21,755
I only know about myself. I'm sorry.

770
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:25,133
You sure? Maybe it was your fault...

771
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:28,637
Kosuke, Noppo really doesn't know.

772
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,764
It's not Noppo's fault.

773
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,769
Besides, we've all been living together,
so he's one of us now.

774
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:39,231
He's one of us? Are you serious?

775
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,314
What?

776
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,443
That is <i>not</i> normal. He's a monster!

777
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,655
- Don't say it like that...
- And "living together"? Seriously?

778
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,532
Are we playing house here?

779
00:47:48,615 --> 00:47:51,618
Did you forget it's your fault
we got dragged into this

780
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,538
after you holed up
in this run-down apartment?!

781
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,415
This is <i>your</i> fault.

782
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,585
Even if we get home,
it doesn't mean I'll forgive you!

783
00:47:59,668 --> 00:48:01,420
What do you mean "living together"?

784
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:05,424
- This is the worst! It's filthy and...
- Reina!

785
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,427
Don't say stuff like that!

786
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,729
Does it hurt?

787
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,944
Maybe I'm not scared after all.

788
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:29,948
Noppo's tall, but I think he's a good guy.

789
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,617
You're really something.

790
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:35,037
What the heck? Then what about me?

791
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,538
You're a good guy too!

792
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:46,632
I'm afraid of scary things,
but Noppo has gentle eyes.

793
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:49,092
Noppo isn't a bad guy.

794
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,970
Yeah, we all agree, right?

795
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,597
- Yeah.
- That's right.

796
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,058
Kosuke.

797
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,979
You really don't know anything?

798
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,190
Sorry.

799
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:07,986
No more secrets now, okay?

800
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,613
All right, let's eat!

801
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:12,157
- My rice ball!
- You can still eat it! Three-second rule!

802
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,075
I can grill it.

803
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,576
- Okay.
- Neanderthal.

804
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,539
What are you looking at?

805
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,999
Let me see!

806
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,293
Hey! You're asking for it!

807
00:49:23,835 --> 00:49:25,420
No running in the hospital!

808
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,505
- Sorry!
- Sorry!

809
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,715
Today's your birthday, right?

810
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:31,343
Maybe you'll get something
from Grandpa Yasuji.

811
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:35,305
What? I bet you're
plotting something with him.

812
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,390
It's a secret.

813
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,644
{\an8}You were all freaked out before,
and now you're completely fine.

814
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:45,148
{\an8}I know Grandpa Yasuji will be fine!
Kosuke, you were freaked out too!

815
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:49,027
{\an8}Shut up! I bet
you're probably still freaked...

816
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:52,531
You never shut up.

817
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,534
YASUJI KUMAGAYA

818
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:01,790
You <i>are</i> still freaked out.

819
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:08,839
Well, he's not your grandpa anyway,
so don't be so scared.

820
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,597
That's true. He's your grandpa after all.

821
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,266
My...

822
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,729
Hey, Natsume?

823
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,648
Kosuke!

824
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:28,984
Grandpa.

825
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,069
- Go apologize.
- What?

826
00:50:31,153 --> 00:50:33,321
Go apologize! Now!

827
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,164
Kosuke.

828
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,583
Natsume.

829
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:53,133
That can't be!

830
00:50:56,511 --> 00:51:00,474
Does that stuffed animal
mean something special?

831
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:05,478
Yeah.

832
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:10,275
Grandpa Yasuji bought it for me
when I was little.

833
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:14,613
I'd wanted one for a long time,
but I was holding back.

834
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:18,742
I don't know how he found out,
but he bought it for my birthday.

835
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:22,788
Grandpa Yasuji was
always trying to surprise me.

836
00:51:23,455 --> 00:51:25,248
That's why I treasure it.

837
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,251
You really loved Kosuke's grandpa,
didn't you?

838
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,253
Yeah.

839
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:35,133
I guess you could say
he was like a father to me.

840
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:42,933
That's a little creepy
when it's someone else's grandpa, huh?

841
00:51:57,114 --> 00:52:02,077
I would've been at that Florida theme park
with my mom and dad by now.

842
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:05,038
Reina, you really love
theme parks, don't you?

843
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,291
You're saying I'm childish, aren't you?

844
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:12,295
Well, so what?
That's where I made so many good memories.

845
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:15,799
It's probably the same.

846
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:16,882
Huh?

847
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,720
I think this is
a special place for Natsume.

848
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,806
It has so many memories.

849
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,561
This place? You gotta be kidding.

850
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:32,315
Listen, I want to apologize to you.

851
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:34,025
About what?

852
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,986
I'm all talk, right?

853
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:39,406
I'm always letting you take charge
because you're so brazen.

854
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,074
Brazen?

855
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,911
I'm sorry I said all those things.
I'll try harder.

856
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:47,080
Juri.

857
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,332
Let's make it home together
no matter what.

858
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:52,335
And then... You can
come with us to Florida.

859
00:52:57,257 --> 00:53:00,177
When are we gonna get home?

860
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,055
Are we really getting any closer?

861
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,560
<i>I'm so hungry I'm so hungry</i>

862
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:11,855
<i>A hundred Big Macs and ten nuggets</i>

863
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:15,942
<i>-Happy Meals aren't enough</i>
-Taishi, you're making us even hungrier.

864
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:19,196
Shut up, you runt! You woke me up!

865
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:21,740
Kosuke, aren't we there yet?

866
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:23,742
Nope. It's cloudy, so I can't see.

867
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:25,202
What?

868
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:30,123
What's that?

869
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:32,000
Hey, you guys!

870
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:32,959
We there?!

871
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:33,919
What, really?!

872
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,253
That fast?

873
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:36,755
What? Where?

874
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:37,756
That!

875
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,424
Huh? That's not the town!

876
00:53:39,507 --> 00:53:41,635
What? Jeez.

877
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:43,428
What is it?

878
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,804
Is it McDonald's?!

879
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,140
It can't be. It looks old.

880
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,893
- A department store.
- Huh?

881
00:53:49,976 --> 00:53:51,978
Hey, what's wrong?

882
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:57,400
Kosuke, it's coming this way,
just like when Narahara drifted by.

883
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,484
Yeah. So?

884
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,153
- I'll try to get on it.
- What?!

885
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:03,865
We're low on food, aren't we?
I'll do it right this time.

886
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,158
Me too.

887
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,160
I want to go too.

888
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:09,745
Me too.

889
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:23,551
It's a rooftop amusement park.

890
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,806
<i>This is Taishi on the apartment roof!
You guys better hurry!</i>

891
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:30,433
Okay. Radio us if something happens.

892
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:34,312
Up there. We can't stay for long, okay?

893
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,066
Hey, Natsume!

894
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,025
Huh?

895
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:40,819
What's wrong? Something happen?

896
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,572
No, I'm fine. Let's go!

897
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,491
Right!

898
00:54:47,158 --> 00:54:49,577
I thought we'd find something here, but...

899
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,205
It's a total dump.

900
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:54,541
- How about over there?
- Nothing.

901
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,126
- Here.
- Huh?

902
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:57,919
{\an8}2016
BIG THANK YOU FESTIVAL!

903
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,212
{\an8}Six years ago?

904
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,840
No way.

905
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:05,051
Wait a second!

906
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,636
What's wrong?!

907
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:07,721
Just wait.

908
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,518
What? Not again?

909
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,020
Is somebody there?

910
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:17,605
Hey! We don't have much time!

911
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:26,531
Hey, wait up!

912
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,743
This is...

913
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:32,120
Huh? This is what?

914
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,373
Natsume!

915
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:38,501
Hey, where'd you go?! Whoa!

916
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:40,378
There you are.

917
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:43,131
Hey, was someone here?

918
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,175
If not, let's get out of here!

919
00:55:45,258 --> 00:55:46,258
What?

920
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:50,805
What's going on? You've been acting weird.

921
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:52,390
Hey!

922
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:55,727
I hated this place.

923
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:56,810
What?

924
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,271
{\an8}TOY PARADISE

925
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,524
{\an8}When I was little,
we came to buy me a birthday gift,

926
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:05,028
{\an8}but my parents got in a fight.

927
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,740
I didn't get anything.

928
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,284
I'd forgotten about it.

929
00:56:13,745 --> 00:56:15,497
I'm sorry. Let's go!

930
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:18,917
<i>Kosuke! Answer if you hear me!</i>

931
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,086
What is it, Taishi?!

932
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,091
<i>I finally got through to you!
Get off there! Now!</i>

933
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,175
What?

934
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,317
<i>Taishi, what's going on?!</i>

935
00:56:44,401 --> 00:56:49,072
Kosuke, now you guys
are gonna crash into us!

936
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,990
- This is bad!
- It's gonna crash into us!

937
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,826
Let's get inside!

938
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:55,078
This is bad!

939
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,080
Oh no!

940
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:02,335
Incoming!

941
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,813
Oh no! It's flooding.

942
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:23,314
Natsume, you okay?

943
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:24,232
Yeah.

944
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,192
- Noppo, how about you?
- I'm fine.

945
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,569
- Let's get out, quick!
- Okay!

946
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:43,334
What is this? Is that a kid?

947
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:46,838
Oh, crap!

948
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,382
Natsume, there's no time. Let's go!

949
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,342
Natsume!

950
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,352
- This is a disaster!
- Yuzuru!

951
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:05,440
Pull us over!

952
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:07,859
- Kosuke! All right!
- Yuzuru!

953
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,904
- I'll help!
- Okay!

954
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:21,122
Taishi!

955
00:58:21,956 --> 00:58:23,041
Up there!

956
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,876
- Taishi?!
- Somebody help!

957
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,628
- Taishi!
- Help me!

958
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:27,879
I'll go!

959
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,132
Juri! I'm coming too!

960
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:32,383
Please save him!

961
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:37,430
Are you okay?!

962
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:39,390
Yeah, I'm fine!

963
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:42,768
Taishi!

964
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:44,062
Juri!

965
00:58:44,145 --> 00:58:45,605
You're okay now!

966
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,273
- What were you doing?!
- Reina!

967
00:58:47,357 --> 00:58:48,608
On my mark!

968
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,691
Okay!

969
00:58:49,734 --> 00:58:51,069
Ready, pull!

970
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:56,449
That was close.

971
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,618
You gave me a heart attack.

972
00:58:58,701 --> 00:59:02,413
Juri, Reina, you saved my life!

973
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,375
My walkie... Ouch!

974
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:07,335
It's okay. I'll get it.

975
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,297
Huh?

976
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,432
Hey, Juri!

977
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,768
- Juri!
- Juri!

978
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:25,687
- It's Juri!
- What?

979
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:27,689
Juri!

980
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,692
Juri!

981
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:34,279
Yuzuru, we'll go help!
Pull us over that way!

982
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:35,989
Got it!

983
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,462
Juri, I'm coming!

984
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,342
Juri, hold on!

985
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,178
Juri!

986
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,773
Natsume!

987
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,076
Kosuke! Natsume!

988
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:05,995
Juri.

989
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,796
Noppo!

990
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,135
Wake up.

991
01:01:22,762 --> 01:01:24,013
Juri.

992
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:43,491
Ow!

993
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:46,536
What's wrong with you?

994
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,745
I'm sorry!

995
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,625
Don't touch her!

996
01:01:55,086 --> 01:01:59,006
It's your fault all this happened!

997
01:01:59,090 --> 01:01:59,966
What?

998
01:02:00,049 --> 01:02:02,885
What are you gonna do
if Juri dies like this?!

999
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,929
Hold on, Reina!

1000
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:08,850
If Natsume hadn't saved her,
Juri might've been washed away by...

1001
01:02:08,933 --> 01:02:10,226
I don't care!

1002
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:15,231
Juri is... She's my best friend!

1003
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,441
But you...

1004
01:02:17,066 --> 01:02:18,943
I'm sorry.

1005
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,028
I can't take it anymore.

1006
01:02:21,112 --> 01:02:23,823
We'll probably never make it home now.

1007
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:25,867
We're all gonna die!

1008
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:26,951
Enough!

1009
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:33,708
Reina, stop it, please.

1010
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,080
I brought some food.

1011
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:15,917
Is your foot okay?

1012
01:03:21,464 --> 01:03:24,300
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

1013
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:37,979
Huh?

1014
01:03:43,820 --> 01:03:47,114
I know it's you, Kosuke!
What are you doing? Go away!

1015
01:03:47,198 --> 01:03:50,284
Come on! I came by
to hear what you had to say.

1016
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:54,664
What?! Don't touch people's
treasured things without asking!

1017
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:57,917
You are so hopeless!

1018
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,421
You've acted like a little brother
ever since we were little.

1019
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:05,132
Grandpa Yasuji bought whatever
you wanted when you sulked.

1020
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,050
Hey.

1021
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:08,135
- I'd never act the way you...
- Hey!

1022
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,220
What?!

1023
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:11,639
I don't

1024
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,017
think you mean that.

1025
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:17,520
Huh? What do you mean?

1026
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:19,105
I know you were crying.

1027
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,319
No, I wasn't.

1028
01:04:26,195 --> 01:04:30,449
Don't hold it in.
That's why I came to listen.

1029
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:38,332
The truth is

1030
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:41,919
I'm a crybaby.

1031
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,550
<i>You know, right?</i>

1032
01:04:47,633 --> 01:04:50,011
<i>My family was a disaster,</i>

1033
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:53,014
<i>so I was always crying.</i>

1034
01:04:58,978 --> 01:04:59,978
<i>But...</i>

1035
01:05:00,646 --> 01:05:02,231
<i>No matter how much I cried,</i>

1036
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:06,110
<i>nothing would change,
and it all fell apart.</i>

1037
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:11,365
<i>That's why I stopped myself
from wanting anything back then.</i>

1038
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,745
<i>I thought it would be easier that way.</i>

1039
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:24,003
<i>But once I came to your apartment,
and Grandpa Yasuji took me in,</i>

1040
01:05:24,921 --> 01:05:27,840
<i>I think I really was happy.</i>

1041
01:05:29,175 --> 01:05:35,765
<i>After all, it felt as if that's what
a real family was like.</i>

1042
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,809
Say, "cheese!"

1043
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,520
- <i>Plus...</i>
- Cut it out, Natsume!

1044
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,773
<i>...I could talk about anything,</i>

1045
01:05:44,565 --> 01:05:47,485
<i>and it was okay to cry.</i>

1046
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:52,031
<i>I never knew I could be so happy.</i>

1047
01:05:58,496 --> 01:06:01,457
But Grandpa Yasuji passed away.

1048
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:06,796
The apartment is gone too,
and it all fell apart again.

1049
01:06:08,839 --> 01:06:12,426
<i>The more I thought about
how I hated goodbyes,</i>

1050
01:06:12,510 --> 01:06:14,553
<i>the more I struggled.</i>

1051
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:19,183
<i>Even if I had told my mom,</i>

1052
01:06:20,226 --> 01:06:21,936
<i>there's nothing she could've done.</i>

1053
01:06:23,854 --> 01:06:27,400
<i>That's why I had no choice
but to come here.</i>

1054
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:33,656
I'm sorry. I didn't want to
trouble you either, Kosuke.

1055
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:37,576
It's my fault for moping around.

1056
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,495
That's not true.

1057
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:43,207
It's my fault
for dragging everyone into this.

1058
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:47,545
And I still complain like this.
I'm the worst.

1059
01:06:49,046 --> 01:06:51,966
What happened to Juri is my fault too.

1060
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:54,760
I'm even worse.

1061
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,929
Why? You're not...

1062
01:06:57,013 --> 01:07:00,599
No. I knew it was hard on you,

1063
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:03,477
but I couldn't do anything.

1064
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:06,731
Plus, I hurt you
by saying those awful things.

1065
01:07:10,317 --> 01:07:15,781
I didn't like the little fella
when Grandpa Yasuji first gave him to me.

1066
01:07:15,865 --> 01:07:16,865
What?

1067
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,245
<i>It brought back bad memories.</i>

1068
01:07:23,873 --> 01:07:29,045
<i>But when I used to play with you,
it was always with us.</i>

1069
01:07:30,129 --> 01:07:32,298
<i>That's why it became my treasure.</i>

1070
01:07:33,466 --> 01:07:35,301
<i>It's thanks to you, Kosuke.</i>

1071
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:39,972
<i>But not only that.</i>

1072
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:43,851
<i>Going to school together
and playing soccer together,</i>

1073
01:07:43,934 --> 01:07:45,478
<i>it was all so much fun.</i>

1074
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:50,483
<i>That alone makes me glad
to have spent time with you, Kosuke.</i>

1075
01:07:53,652 --> 01:07:55,988
Okay! End of story.

1076
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,449
I'm fine now.

1077
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:02,244
I'll take care of my own problems myself!

1078
01:08:03,788 --> 01:08:06,582
You could let someone help...

1079
01:08:06,665 --> 01:08:09,752
Thanks for that though,
even if I talked too much.

1080
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:11,128
Kosuke.

1081
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:13,672
Let's go home together!

1082
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:18,928
I'll...

1083
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,055
What was that?

1084
01:08:21,889 --> 01:08:23,099
Kosuke, down there!

1085
01:08:23,182 --> 01:08:24,433
What's all this?!

1086
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:35,611
What was that sound?

1087
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,448
It's worse than it was
with that department store!

1088
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:46,205
Kosuke, the sky!

1089
01:08:51,335 --> 01:08:52,545
Isn't that...

1090
01:08:52,628 --> 01:08:54,213
...the Milky Way?

1091
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:56,132
That glow is...

1092
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:06,475
Hey, Kosuke.

1093
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,979
It's been so long.
Shouldn't we be back by now?

1094
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:16,986
Dang it.

1095
01:09:17,069 --> 01:09:20,739
{\an8}Will we ever be able to get back home?

1096
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:32,001
Guys!

1097
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,462
- Wake up!
- What's wrong?!

1098
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:38,632
Downstairs! There's water downstairs!

1099
01:09:41,385 --> 01:09:42,678
No way!

1100
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,727
That crash must've made a hole.

1101
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:51,061
What're we gonna do?

1102
01:09:52,479 --> 01:09:54,190
We might have to leave.

1103
01:09:54,273 --> 01:09:55,316
- What?
- No.

1104
01:09:55,816 --> 01:09:58,277
- Get everyone together!
- Okay!

1105
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,530
Noppo's missing?

1106
01:10:02,114 --> 01:10:03,490
At a time like this?

1107
01:10:05,701 --> 01:10:09,413
Is he still hiding something?

1108
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:15,877
There he is!

1109
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:19,840
Noppo! I'm glad you're safe!
We need to hurry!

1110
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:27,056
Noppo. Tell us everything you know.

1111
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:33,437
The building is sinking.
It'll never make it to town.

1112
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:37,316
We don't know what to do.
Isn't there some other way?!

1113
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:43,822
Noppo.

1114
01:11:24,488 --> 01:11:28,659
<i>There wasn't supposed to be
anyone else here.</i>

1115
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:35,249
<i>I couldn't abandon Natsume
when she was so lonely.</i>

1116
01:11:37,001 --> 01:11:39,503
<i>And same with Kosuke.</i>

1117
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:55,561
<i>I've watched over both of you
all this time.</i>

1118
01:11:57,813 --> 01:12:00,024
I'm part of this apartment.

1119
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:03,527
This is the only place I belong.

1120
01:12:04,903 --> 01:12:07,448
<i>That's why I was always
with the two of you.</i>

1121
01:12:08,449 --> 01:12:12,870
<i>Seeing you laughing so happily together,</i>

1122
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:16,248
<i>I couldn't get it out of my mind.</i>

1123
01:12:25,132 --> 01:12:28,886
{\an8}<i>After you both left, I finally understood.</i>

1124
01:12:28,969 --> 01:12:30,012
{\an8}CONSTRUCTION
KEEP OUT

1125
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:35,893
I think I really liked
seeing the two of you smile.

1126
01:12:36,602 --> 01:12:37,936
That's why...

1127
01:12:44,610 --> 01:12:49,239
I was the only one who was
supposed to drift out to sea like this.

1128
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:54,036
And I think I was the one
who brought you all here.

1129
01:12:54,620 --> 01:12:57,122
Huh? What do you mean?

1130
01:12:57,206 --> 01:12:58,624
You brought us here?

1131
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:02,753
You gotta be kidding me.
How are you gonna make this right?

1132
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,298
Reina, Noppo didn't mean to...

1133
01:13:06,382 --> 01:13:08,550
Shut up!

1134
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,093
Reina!

1135
01:13:10,886 --> 01:13:14,973
Why'd you have to drag us into this?

1136
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:16,975
Hey! Answer me!

1137
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:18,060
Reina.

1138
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:21,105
How are we gonna get back home?

1139
01:13:21,605 --> 01:13:25,234
I'm sorry. I don't know
how to get back either.

1140
01:13:26,777 --> 01:13:29,321
Cut us some slack already.

1141
01:13:29,405 --> 01:13:33,158
I'll do anything. Please.

1142
01:13:33,242 --> 01:13:34,326
Reina!

1143
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:38,414
Juri.

1144
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:40,374
Juri!

1145
01:13:45,879 --> 01:13:49,049
Don't do that to me.
I thought you were dead!

1146
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:52,052
That's a bit melodramatic. I'm fine.

1147
01:13:52,136 --> 01:13:54,263
I made it up here all by myself.

1148
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:55,889
Really?!

1149
01:13:56,890 --> 01:13:58,183
Sorry, Juri.

1150
01:13:59,518 --> 01:14:01,395
- Juri!
- You're so silly, Reina.

1151
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,440
What a relief! Are you okay?

1152
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:05,524
Yeah.

1153
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:11,447
Don't cry, Reina.
We're going to Florida together, right?

1154
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:14,867
{\an8}We were. But now...

1155
01:14:14,950 --> 01:14:19,037
{\an8}Don't worry. We'll get home
if we stick together.

1156
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:24,418
- It's my fault, Juri!
- No, it's not.

1157
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:26,837
- I'm okay.
- It's mine too! I'm sorry.

1158
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:30,757
- Don't worry about it, Natsume.
- I'm glad you're okay, Juri.

1159
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:37,806
I want the truth.
You really don't know how to get home?

1160
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,351
I'm sorry.

1161
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:46,356
You should use a raft
to leave as soon as you can.

1162
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:49,943
Don't worry about me.

1163
01:15:07,586 --> 01:15:09,046
- Here you go.
- Got it.

1164
01:15:09,129 --> 01:15:10,297
Let's get more.

1165
01:15:10,380 --> 01:15:11,380
Yeah.

1166
01:15:19,306 --> 01:15:20,390
Is it ready yet?

1167
01:15:20,474 --> 01:15:21,725
Just a little longer.

1168
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:33,320
Natsume, are you done yet?

1169
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:36,406
Oh, yeah.

1170
01:15:37,074 --> 01:15:38,367
Natsume?

1171
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:42,746
Noppo will come back with us too, right?

1172
01:15:43,413 --> 01:15:45,290
Even though this is his fault?

1173
01:15:47,376 --> 01:15:49,378
We can't leave him like this.

1174
01:15:50,295 --> 01:15:53,882
Noppo will die if this building sinks.

1175
01:15:53,966 --> 01:15:56,843
But he's not human. He creeps me out!

1176
01:15:58,178 --> 01:15:59,221
But...

1177
01:15:59,304 --> 01:16:03,809
Besides, what if we can't get back
because he's with us?

1178
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:07,020
I mean, he brought us here.

1179
01:16:07,104 --> 01:16:09,273
We don't know that for sure.

1180
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:10,732
Just stop already.

1181
01:16:11,316 --> 01:16:15,988
Kosuke, Noppo has always been with us.

1182
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:21,368
Not only now. He's always been
with us from long, long ago!

1183
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:28,083
Of course I can't just leave him.

1184
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,001
You are...

1185
01:16:29,084 --> 01:16:32,879
I don't wanna leave
unless we all go home together.

1186
01:16:33,714 --> 01:16:35,465
What is wrong with...

1187
01:16:35,549 --> 01:16:37,384
Don't say that!

1188
01:16:37,467 --> 01:16:40,137
You don't have to die here with him!

1189
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,764
So stop moping around already!

1190
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:47,102
You're right.

1191
01:16:49,146 --> 01:16:53,025
I'm overthinking things again, aren't I?

1192
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:58,905
Hold on! I understand what Reina's saying.

1193
01:16:59,489 --> 01:17:05,078
But even if we could get home
by leaving Noppo behind, it's not right.

1194
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:07,831
I won't do it. It's too cruel.

1195
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:10,167
It's not like I want to either.

1196
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:14,713
That's right. Arguing is
the worst thing we could do right now.

1197
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:18,425
And it's not clear
that this is Noppo's fault.

1198
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:19,426
But...

1199
01:17:19,509 --> 01:17:22,679
I'll stay by your side, Reina.

1200
01:17:24,306 --> 01:17:26,516
I'm sorry, you guys.

1201
01:17:27,684 --> 01:17:30,979
There's no time to argue.
Let's all go together.

1202
01:18:05,263 --> 01:18:06,431
Hey, that's...

1203
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,186
Now everyone can get on, right?

1204
01:18:11,269 --> 01:18:12,813
Do we have enough time?

1205
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:15,148
Don't worry. I'll get it done.

1206
01:18:17,275 --> 01:18:21,113
Natsume, about earlier. I...

1207
01:18:21,780 --> 01:18:23,657
No, I'm sorry.

1208
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:25,659
I already forgot about it.

1209
01:18:25,742 --> 01:18:26,952
Natsume.

1210
01:18:59,359 --> 01:19:01,570
What? Water?!

1211
01:19:01,653 --> 01:19:03,238
- Everyone hurry!
- Noppo!

1212
01:19:03,989 --> 01:19:06,032
- The building's tilting.
- What is this?!

1213
01:19:06,116 --> 01:19:07,242
Is the raft ready?

1214
01:19:07,325 --> 01:19:08,910
- Almost!
- And our stuff?

1215
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:11,663
- There's still some left.
- Let's finish up quick!

1216
01:19:21,131 --> 01:19:22,299
Kosuke!

1217
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,051
The raft's good to go!

1218
01:19:25,135 --> 01:19:27,220
Okay. This is the last of our stuff!

1219
01:19:27,304 --> 01:19:29,723
- Don't make us wait!
- I'll be right there!

1220
01:19:31,475 --> 01:19:33,018
Hey, you idiot!

1221
01:19:33,101 --> 01:19:35,771
You're still here?!
We gotta get out of here!

1222
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:40,525
This was Grandpa Yasuji's room.

1223
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:56,082
Don't worry. I'm fine.

1224
01:19:57,459 --> 01:19:58,919
Let's go, Kosuke.

1225
01:20:06,593 --> 01:20:08,011
- Noppo!
- Noppo!

1226
01:20:09,054 --> 01:20:11,014
I won't let you die here!

1227
01:20:12,599 --> 01:20:14,226
Hurry!

1228
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:17,020
Hurry up!

1229
01:20:17,103 --> 01:20:18,605
Is everything ready?

1230
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,065
We're good to go!

1231
01:20:20,148 --> 01:20:21,525
Come on, Noppo!

1232
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:24,778
Noppo, get on quick!

1233
01:20:27,113 --> 01:20:28,281
Noppo!

1234
01:20:33,578 --> 01:20:34,955
Noppo!

1235
01:20:43,421 --> 01:20:45,799
Noppo! I don't understand!

1236
01:20:46,758 --> 01:20:50,637
This is where we say goodbye. Forgive me.

1237
01:20:59,145 --> 01:21:02,566
<i>I don't want to say goodbye.</i>

1238
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:07,988
I can't do this again!

1239
01:21:09,072 --> 01:21:10,115
Wait!

1240
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:12,993
Natsume!

1241
01:21:15,203 --> 01:21:17,414
Natsume! You idiot.

1242
01:21:19,082 --> 01:21:22,419
Come back, Natsume!

1243
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:26,047
No. This is insane!

1244
01:21:26,882 --> 01:21:27,882
Dang it!

1245
01:21:27,924 --> 01:21:29,384
- Kumagaya!
- Taishi!

1246
01:21:29,467 --> 01:21:30,802
- Let's row back!
- Got it!

1247
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:34,347
Come back!

1248
01:21:35,015 --> 01:21:36,308
Natsume!

1249
01:21:36,391 --> 01:21:37,392
Noppo!

1250
01:21:37,475 --> 01:21:40,270
- Natsume, you shouldn't be here.
- Noppo, hurry!

1251
01:21:42,355 --> 01:21:45,108
Natsume!

1252
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:49,195
Natsume!

1253
01:21:51,531 --> 01:21:53,283
This is useless!

1254
01:21:53,366 --> 01:21:55,535
Kumagaya, come back!

1255
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,787
Reina, the rope! I'll go!

1256
01:21:59,122 --> 01:22:01,541
You said we'd go home together.

1257
01:22:02,876 --> 01:22:07,172
Why are you doing this? You idiot!

1258
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:13,511
Kosuke!

1259
01:22:15,388 --> 01:22:18,391
- Pull!
- But Natsume is...!

1260
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:21,519
No! We gotta go get her!

1261
01:22:21,603 --> 01:22:24,314
Natsume!

1262
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:34,532
Noppo, don't worry!
We can still make it somehow!

1263
01:22:40,997 --> 01:22:42,248
Noppo?

1264
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:45,085
No, don't do this.

1265
01:22:45,710 --> 01:22:47,212
Just forget about me!

1266
01:22:47,295 --> 01:22:48,296
No way!

1267
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:51,925
I can't leave you here!
There's gotta be a way!

1268
01:22:52,509 --> 01:22:55,929
{\an8}Besides, I bet we can
make it through this storm.

1269
01:22:56,930 --> 01:22:59,099
{\an8}I know we can get home together!

1270
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:09,526
Go back.

1271
01:23:11,903 --> 01:23:13,405
It's no use.

1272
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:14,739
This is impossible.

1273
01:23:16,866 --> 01:23:18,451
Dang it.

1274
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:21,871
Dang it!

1275
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:25,000
Natsume.

1276
01:23:27,335 --> 01:23:31,214
What am I supposed to do now?

1277
01:23:39,806 --> 01:23:41,057
The water's glowing!

1278
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:42,183
What is this?

1279
01:23:46,771 --> 01:23:48,064
We're moving.

1280
01:23:48,148 --> 01:23:49,274
What's going on?

1281
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,194
Aren't we heading back the way we came?

1282
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:54,279
What?

1283
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,297
Mom? Everyone's there.

1284
01:24:23,099 --> 01:24:26,227
We can get home, right?

1285
01:24:28,813 --> 01:24:29,939
Yeah.

1286
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,900
Taishi, we're...

1287
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,693
Yeah.

1288
01:24:45,121 --> 01:24:47,582
Wait. Where's Natsume?

1289
01:24:53,046 --> 01:24:56,925
Even if we make it home,
she won't be there.

1290
01:25:05,558 --> 01:25:06,558
Natsume!

1291
01:25:07,435 --> 01:25:08,978
Over here!

1292
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:10,480
Natsume!

1293
01:25:12,524 --> 01:25:13,566
Hey.

1294
01:25:14,442 --> 01:25:18,113
Wait! Why are you going that way?

1295
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:21,241
You said we'd go home together!

1296
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,159
Natsume!

1297
01:25:28,414 --> 01:25:30,667
Natsume!

1298
01:25:30,750 --> 01:25:31,751
Stop!

1299
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,214
Let me go! Natsume!

1300
01:25:36,965 --> 01:25:38,258
Kumagaya!

1301
01:25:39,843 --> 01:25:42,345
- Don't go!
- Kosuke!

1302
01:25:42,428 --> 01:25:44,848
Natsume!

1303
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:50,311
Natsume!

1304
01:25:52,397 --> 01:25:55,984
Natsume!

1305
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:13,126
A bunny?

1306
01:26:16,588 --> 01:26:20,633
No. We weren't supposed to
go home like this.

1307
01:26:20,717 --> 01:26:27,473
{\an8}I swear, I'm gonna tell her...
I'll tell that idiot...

1308
01:26:27,557 --> 01:26:28,892
{\an8}What's that?

1309
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,109
Isn't that...

1310
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:40,737
YASHIMA

1311
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:11,184
All I wanted was for you
to smile, Natsume.

1312
01:27:11,976 --> 01:27:13,394
That's all.

1313
01:27:15,355 --> 01:27:19,192
But... it ended up like this.

1314
01:27:21,027 --> 01:27:24,948
We'll get through the storm soon.
Don't worry.

1315
01:27:41,297 --> 01:27:43,591
<i>If I don't make it back,</i>

1316
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:45,843
<i>I wonder what my mom will do.</i>

1317
01:27:48,554 --> 01:27:51,057
<i>I bet it'd be easier for her that way.</i>

1318
01:27:52,308 --> 01:27:53,393
<i>It's true.</i>

1319
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:57,689
<i>I'm the reason it all fell apart.</i>

1320
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:03,778
<i>Kosuke too. Because I was so selfish,</i>

1321
01:28:04,445 --> 01:28:05,363
KAMONOMIYA HOSPITAL

1322
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:08,241
<i>...he wasn't able to say goodbye
to Grandpa Yasuji.</i>

1323
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:13,871
<i>I've been barging
into a home that wasn't mine.</i>

1324
01:28:13,955 --> 01:28:15,123
YASUJI KUMAGAYA

1325
01:28:15,206 --> 01:28:16,416
<i>Now I know.</i>

1326
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,876
<i>It's better</i>

1327
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,754
if I just disappear.

1328
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:25,508
But...

1329
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:28,219
But...

1330
01:28:29,095 --> 01:28:30,263
I'm scared.

1331
01:28:31,264 --> 01:28:32,849
I'm really scared.

1332
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,069
Hey!

1333
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:47,238
Natsume!

1334
01:28:47,322 --> 01:28:50,825
Natsume! Noppo!

1335
01:28:50,908 --> 01:28:52,785
Natsume!

1336
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:12,638
All right! We're good to go, Kosuke!

1337
01:29:12,722 --> 01:29:13,765
Nice pass!

1338
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:18,018
Kosuke!

1339
01:29:23,024 --> 01:29:24,317
Here goes!

1340
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,871
What are you doing here?!

1341
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:37,789
Move!

1342
01:29:37,872 --> 01:29:39,332
What are you doing?!

1343
01:29:39,415 --> 01:29:41,751
We'll have the Ferris wheel
pull this cable!

1344
01:29:44,712 --> 01:29:46,839
Okay. Ready to go!

1345
01:29:47,423 --> 01:29:49,842
- He did it, Taishi!
- Kosuke!

1346
01:29:49,926 --> 01:29:51,302
Kumagaya!

1347
01:29:53,304 --> 01:29:54,305
Reina!

1348
01:30:04,690 --> 01:30:05,942
I'm sorry.

1349
01:30:06,901 --> 01:30:09,362
I remember you.

1350
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:12,365
You always came with your father.

1351
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:15,451
Hurry!

1352
01:30:16,327 --> 01:30:18,955
You idiot! Why'd you do this?!

1353
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:23,835
I never asked you to save me!

1354
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:25,628
I was fine!

1355
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:31,509
{\an8}You say, "I'm fine, I'm fine!"
But it's all a big lie!

1356
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:34,220
- No, it's not!
- Just shut up already!

1357
01:30:42,437 --> 01:30:45,523
Why'd you have to come back?

1358
01:30:45,606 --> 01:30:47,525
{\an8}Everyone's gonna die now!

1359
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:50,278
{\an8}You were the one who holed up here!

1360
01:30:51,612 --> 01:30:54,282
{\an8}I really do hate
this crappy old apartment!

1361
01:30:54,365 --> 01:30:58,161
{\an8}It reminds me of how you hid and cried
while I pretended not to notice!

1362
01:30:58,244 --> 01:31:01,289
{\an8}And it makes me wanna punch myself!

1363
01:31:01,372 --> 01:31:05,084
{\an8}I said you had nothing to do
with my family, but that's not true!

1364
01:31:05,168 --> 01:31:08,045
{\an8}You didn't barge into our home!

1365
01:31:08,129 --> 01:31:10,423
{\an8}It's your home too!

1366
01:31:10,506 --> 01:31:13,050
{\an8}But we have to leave it behind now!

1367
01:31:13,134 --> 01:31:16,012
{\an8}That's the only way
we'll make it home together!

1368
01:31:16,095 --> 01:31:18,055
{\an8}I wanna be with you

1369
01:31:18,639 --> 01:31:21,517
{\an8}way more than Noppo does!

1370
01:31:34,155 --> 01:31:36,240
{\an8}I'm sorry, Kosuke.

1371
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:40,828
{\an8}I don't want to lose you either, Kosuke.
I want to go home!

1372
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:43,456
{\an8}But it's too late.

1373
01:31:43,539 --> 01:31:47,585
{\an8}Don't worry! We'll make it
as long as we stick together!

1374
01:31:47,668 --> 01:31:50,087
{\an8}Once I pass to you, what do you do?

1375
01:31:51,130 --> 01:31:52,840
{\an8}There's just one thing.

1376
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:55,218
{\an8}Remember how much we practiced?

1377
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:58,846
I take the shot.

1378
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:02,308
Exactly! That's what
a two-forward formation does!

1379
01:32:02,391 --> 01:32:03,434
Right.

1380
01:32:08,147 --> 01:32:11,108
Noppo. You're coming home with us.

1381
01:32:11,776 --> 01:32:12,776
{\an8}You got that?

1382
01:32:13,778 --> 01:32:14,778
{\an8}Yeah.

1383
01:32:15,404 --> 01:32:17,532
We're gonna get through this storm!

1384
01:32:21,244 --> 01:32:23,120
Better brace yourselves!

1385
01:32:23,871 --> 01:32:25,456
Here it comes!

1386
01:32:39,053 --> 01:32:40,137
It's pulling it up!

1387
01:32:40,221 --> 01:32:41,097
All right!

1388
01:32:41,180 --> 01:32:44,100
- Kosuke, it worked!
- You never know till you try!

1389
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:04,912
Whoa! It's all tangled up!

1390
01:33:08,874 --> 01:33:13,921
The cable passes through the gondolas
and on to the apartment building.

1391
01:33:16,799 --> 01:33:18,426
If it snaps,

1392
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:21,053
we won't be able to save them.

1393
01:33:25,808 --> 01:33:26,684
Guys.

1394
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:28,060
It's tied up tight!

1395
01:33:29,645 --> 01:33:30,938
This side too!

1396
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:36,277
I'll tie one more!

1397
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:38,779
Thank you! Now to put this through!

1398
01:33:49,749 --> 01:33:51,083
It stopped.

1399
01:33:51,167 --> 01:33:52,460
We did it!

1400
01:33:55,713 --> 01:33:57,840
- I'll help! Relax!
- It's too dangerous!

1401
01:34:08,267 --> 01:34:09,935
What happened?!

1402
01:34:16,108 --> 01:34:18,110
- Stupid Ferris wheel!
- Careful!

1403
01:34:18,194 --> 01:34:20,237
We're all going home together!

1404
01:34:20,321 --> 01:34:24,241
{\an8}And you're all gonna enjoy
my mom's famous croquettes!

1405
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:26,744
Yeah! We're going home!

1406
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,580
{\an8}I wanna play <i>Super Smash Bros.</i>
With everyone!

1407
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:33,459
And I wanna go to Florida with Kumagaya!

1408
01:34:33,542 --> 01:34:34,835
With me too, right?!

1409
01:34:34,919 --> 01:34:35,795
{\an8}Juri!

1410
01:34:35,878 --> 01:34:38,214
{\an8}Let's all save them together!

1411
01:34:38,297 --> 01:34:39,882
Be careful.

1412
01:34:39,965 --> 01:34:41,342
Let's go!

1413
01:34:41,425 --> 01:34:43,177
Kamo Elementary, fight!

1414
01:34:54,772 --> 01:34:57,233
Oh no! We're drifting away!

1415
01:35:00,778 --> 01:35:01,821
No!

1416
01:35:03,072 --> 01:35:05,574
- It's too dangerous!
- If I let go, Kumagaya will...

1417
01:35:08,244 --> 01:35:09,412
Reina!

1418
01:35:24,301 --> 01:35:25,177
Are you okay?

1419
01:35:25,261 --> 01:35:27,847
Don't worry about me.

1420
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:28,973
Oh no!

1421
01:35:30,725 --> 01:35:32,017
It's starting to spin!

1422
01:35:34,729 --> 01:35:36,355
Stop!

1423
01:35:38,357 --> 01:35:40,234
Don't go!

1424
01:35:41,610 --> 01:35:44,864
Dang it!

1425
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:48,534
Taishi!

1426
01:36:30,117 --> 01:36:31,117
No way.

1427
01:37:05,486 --> 01:37:06,821
I'll pull you up.

1428
01:37:11,408 --> 01:37:12,409
Natsume!

1429
01:37:14,370 --> 01:37:15,412
Kosuke!

1430
01:37:15,496 --> 01:37:17,873
Hang on. I'll...

1431
01:37:20,042 --> 01:37:22,253
Dang it! Are you okay?

1432
01:37:23,170 --> 01:37:25,548
I said I'm fine! This is nothing!

1433
01:37:36,100 --> 01:37:37,518
Noppo?

1434
01:37:38,060 --> 01:37:40,271
Hold on to her tight!

1435
01:37:40,855 --> 01:37:42,773
Natsume, give me your other hand!

1436
01:37:43,357 --> 01:37:47,027
{\an8}I didn't give you permission
to leave the game!

1437
01:37:47,611 --> 01:37:51,282
{\an8}You'll regret it if I end up
the only forward on the team!

1438
01:37:52,825 --> 01:37:55,286
{\an8}You'd never handle it on your own!

1439
01:37:55,369 --> 01:37:58,914
Well, you'd never break through
without my passes!

1440
01:37:58,998 --> 01:38:00,791
- Now I'm mad!
- Ouch!

1441
01:38:38,162 --> 01:38:40,122
We'll be fine, okay?

1442
01:38:42,374 --> 01:38:44,293
Kosuke, I know you're freaked out too.

1443
01:38:44,376 --> 01:38:48,088
What? No, I'm not, you little...

1444
01:38:49,757 --> 01:38:52,259
Natsume. Kosuke.

1445
01:39:32,967 --> 01:39:35,386
<i>I tried to hold them back.</i>

1446
01:39:36,095 --> 01:39:38,430
<i>That's why it ended up like this, but...</i>

1447
01:39:40,224 --> 01:39:42,393
<i>I no longer want to turn back time.</i>

1448
01:39:43,727 --> 01:39:46,438
<i>I don't care what happens to me.</i>

1449
01:39:48,107 --> 01:39:49,775
<i>But these two,</i>

1450
01:39:49,858 --> 01:39:51,735
<i>Natsume and Kosuke,</i>

1451
01:39:52,236 --> 01:39:53,821
<i>have their whole lives ahead!</i>

1452
01:39:55,239 --> 01:39:56,365
<i>I want them to live</i>

1453
01:39:57,241 --> 01:40:00,869
<i>and to keep on smiling!</i>

1454
01:41:19,823 --> 01:41:21,784
Where are we?

1455
01:41:21,867 --> 01:41:23,452
The storm is gone.

1456
01:41:23,535 --> 01:41:25,746
Did we survive?

1457
01:41:26,455 --> 01:41:27,455
Yes.

1458
01:41:29,541 --> 01:41:31,168
Hurray!

1459
01:41:33,796 --> 01:41:35,547
What a relief, seriously!

1460
01:41:35,631 --> 01:41:37,508
- You tried to act cool.
- I was terrified!

1461
01:41:37,591 --> 01:41:39,760
Kosuke, you wimp!

1462
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:42,346
Shut up!

1463
01:41:49,061 --> 01:41:50,395
It's an island.

1464
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:54,316
That wasn't our town we saw.

1465
01:41:54,399 --> 01:41:56,944
- Yeah.
- Hey!

1466
01:41:57,528 --> 01:41:59,321
Hey!

1467
01:41:59,404 --> 01:42:02,825
- Kosuke!
- Kumagaya!

1468
01:42:06,161 --> 01:42:08,789
YASHIMA

1469
01:42:10,999 --> 01:42:11,999
Listen.

1470
01:42:12,584 --> 01:42:13,627
What is it?

1471
01:42:14,128 --> 01:42:15,128
Yashima was

1472
01:42:15,796 --> 01:42:19,049
{\an8}the first amusement park
my dad took me to.

1473
01:42:20,134 --> 01:42:23,554
{\an8}I've ridden this Ferris wheel
so many times.

1474
01:42:25,389 --> 01:42:26,974
{\an8}I loved it.

1475
01:42:29,518 --> 01:42:30,644
Reina.

1476
01:42:30,727 --> 01:42:32,479
Reina, we should go.

1477
01:42:32,563 --> 01:42:35,649
Yeah, but...

1478
01:42:35,732 --> 01:42:42,489
You were always daddy's little girl,
and so spoiled, but you did well out here.

1479
01:42:44,241 --> 01:42:47,119
Yeah, I really did try.

1480
01:42:47,911 --> 01:42:50,581
Now you must go.

1481
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:51,664
Okay.

1482
01:43:00,716 --> 01:43:05,596
Thank you for spending so much time here
and for all of your love.

1483
01:43:06,471 --> 01:43:09,391
Thank you. Thank you!

1484
01:43:12,352 --> 01:43:14,146
Thank you!

1485
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:16,273
Goodbye!

1486
01:44:18,043 --> 01:44:20,545
Whoa!

1487
01:44:20,629 --> 01:44:22,297
It's so beautiful.

1488
01:44:31,181 --> 01:44:32,641
There's someone there!

1489
01:44:32,724 --> 01:44:34,810
What? Hey, you're right.

1490
01:44:34,893 --> 01:44:36,561
Hey!

1491
01:44:37,187 --> 01:44:39,064
They looked this way! Let's go down!

1492
01:44:39,147 --> 01:44:40,023
Yeah.

1493
01:44:40,107 --> 01:44:41,358
Me too!

1494
01:44:43,026 --> 01:44:44,026
Don't.

1495
01:44:44,486 --> 01:44:45,487
What?

1496
01:44:47,114 --> 01:44:49,616
Only I can move on from here.

1497
01:44:50,701 --> 01:44:53,954
What? But they got off!

1498
01:44:54,037 --> 01:44:55,037
How come?

1499
01:44:56,707 --> 01:44:57,874
I understand now.

1500
01:45:02,212 --> 01:45:04,172
I belong with those children.

1501
01:45:04,798 --> 01:45:07,217
This is where we go.

1502
01:45:08,051 --> 01:45:11,763
If you come with us,
you'll never get back home.

1503
01:45:12,347 --> 01:45:13,640
That's why

1504
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:16,059
I can't go with you.

1505
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:19,646
I'm sorry.

1506
01:45:26,945 --> 01:45:28,071
Natsume?

1507
01:45:31,533 --> 01:45:32,743
Then this is goodbye.

1508
01:45:36,455 --> 01:45:37,455
You...

1509
01:45:40,959 --> 01:45:43,170
You're such a crybaby.

1510
01:45:43,253 --> 01:45:47,299
{\an8}I bet you're worried we won't get home.
But don't worry, stupid...

1511
01:45:48,133 --> 01:45:50,260
That's not it! And I am <i>not</i> crying!

1512
01:45:50,344 --> 01:45:52,387
Just when I was trying hard to...

1513
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:54,389
{\an8}You're making my head itch!

1514
01:45:54,473 --> 01:45:57,142
{\an8}I haven't showered the whole time either!

1515
01:45:57,225 --> 01:45:59,227
{\an8}Yeah! You stink!

1516
01:45:59,311 --> 01:46:00,228
{\an8}That's rude!

1517
01:46:00,312 --> 01:46:02,564
{\an8}- You stink too!
- Shut up!

1518
01:46:09,654 --> 01:46:12,866
{\an8}Natsume should be fine now, right, Kosuke?

1519
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:16,828
{\an8}Hey, not you too, Noppo...

1520
01:46:18,288 --> 01:46:19,289
What is it?

1521
01:46:19,373 --> 01:46:20,957
It's that same glow again.

1522
01:46:21,041 --> 01:46:25,754
Don't worry. These little guys
will take all of you back.

1523
01:46:26,380 --> 01:46:27,464
These little guys?

1524
01:46:30,550 --> 01:46:32,010
Noppo!

1525
01:46:34,846 --> 01:46:36,014
Noppo!

1526
01:46:36,848 --> 01:46:38,266
We're moving!

1527
01:46:44,398 --> 01:46:45,857
Noppo!

1528
01:46:50,445 --> 01:46:52,781
See ya, Noppo!

1529
01:46:52,864 --> 01:46:54,866
Take care of yourself!

1530
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:58,370
Goodbye, Noppo!

1531
01:47:02,874 --> 01:47:08,255
{\an8}I'll be fine!
Kosuke and I will be like a team now!

1532
01:47:49,880 --> 01:47:51,840
Awesome!

1533
01:47:53,091 --> 01:47:54,634
Hey, where'd those two go?

1534
01:47:54,718 --> 01:47:55,886
Over there.

1535
01:48:01,016 --> 01:48:03,977
So we're really going home now.

1536
01:48:07,355 --> 01:48:08,440
Natsume?

1537
01:48:13,487 --> 01:48:14,488
It's so beautiful.

1538
01:48:24,623 --> 01:48:26,666
<i>- Natsume!
- This is your home.</i>

1539
01:48:26,750 --> 01:48:28,084
<i>Welcome.</i>

1540
01:48:28,168 --> 01:48:30,879
<i>Kosuke, Natsume.</i>

1541
01:48:32,547 --> 01:48:34,841
-Grandpa Yasuji
-Grandpa.

1542
01:48:40,555 --> 01:48:42,766
Let's go home together, Kosuke.

1543
01:48:43,558 --> 01:48:45,769
I'm ready, Natsume!

1544
01:49:21,137 --> 01:49:22,222
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

1545
01:49:26,560 --> 01:49:27,644
Natsume?

1546
01:49:28,311 --> 01:49:30,105
Natsume!

1547
01:49:30,855 --> 01:49:33,733
Where have you been?! I was so worried!

1548
01:49:34,526 --> 01:49:35,986
Oh, thank goodness!

1549
01:49:36,069 --> 01:49:37,946
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1550
01:49:38,905 --> 01:49:40,198
Natsume?

1551
01:49:41,950 --> 01:49:43,243
Natsume?

1552
01:49:43,785 --> 01:49:48,540
Is it okay if I keep living with you, Mom?

1553
01:49:52,335 --> 01:49:56,506
Of course! You're my darling daughter.

1554
01:49:57,716 --> 01:49:59,509
Can I have my way sometimes?

1555
01:49:59,593 --> 01:50:02,137
Of course you can!
I'm sorry for everything.

1556
01:50:03,138 --> 01:50:05,890
Just tell me whatever it is you want.

1557
01:50:08,268 --> 01:50:11,354
Okay then, Mom...

1558
01:50:13,148 --> 01:50:15,692
No more takeout.

1559
01:50:17,694 --> 01:50:19,154
What?

1560
01:50:19,237 --> 01:50:22,198
Let's make dinner together.

1561
01:50:26,786 --> 01:50:29,080
Welcome home, Natsume.

1562
01:50:36,921 --> 01:50:42,886
<i>The Kamonomiya apartment complex
was built some 60 years ago.</i>

1563
01:50:43,928 --> 01:50:48,475
<i>Some call it the haunted apartments,
but we called it home.</i>

1564
01:50:49,392 --> 01:50:53,980
<i>It was Natsume and my cherished home.</i>

1565
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:56,483
{\an8}SUMMER FESTIVAL
KAMONOMIYA APARTMENTS 64TH ANNIVERSARY

1566
01:50:58,068 --> 01:51:03,198
<i>We spent so much time together,
but I said something awful to her.</i>

1567
01:51:04,157 --> 01:51:07,494
<i>And in the end, I couldn't apologize,</i>

1568
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,747
<i>even after Grandpa told me to.</i>

1569
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:12,957
<i>I'm sorry, Natsume.</i>

1570
01:51:18,380 --> 01:51:22,967
<i>After we returned,
everything went back to the way it was.</i>

1571
01:51:28,723 --> 01:51:33,395
<i>I still can't explain
what really happened.</i>

1572
01:51:34,145 --> 01:51:35,397
<i>It's all a blur.</i>

1573
01:51:36,940 --> 01:51:41,820
<i>I wonder if it was all a dream
like Natsume says.</i>

1574
01:51:47,325 --> 01:51:50,120
<i>But it can't be.</i>

1575
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:54,666
<i>What happened at that apartment was real.</i>

1576
01:51:56,084 --> 01:52:01,631
<i>I can talk to Natsume like I do now
because of everything that happened.</i>

1577
01:52:06,302 --> 01:52:07,387
<i>Grandpa.</i>

1578
01:52:08,346 --> 01:52:12,475
<i>Our house was an incredible place.</i>

1579
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:16,062
<i>That's why Natsume and I will...</i>

1580
01:52:17,939 --> 01:52:19,065
Thank you.

1581
01:52:23,153 --> 01:52:26,239
Never thought I'd hear
those words from you.

1582
01:52:35,290 --> 01:52:40,712
Don't scare me like that!
Are you sure you two are fine?

1583
