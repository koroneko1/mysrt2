Characters, actions, occupations and events in this series are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.599
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:21.440
Is there anything you need?

00:00:23.308 --> 00:00:24.142
Take it off.

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:26.447
Tell your legal guardian to get it back later.

00:00:26.447 --> 00:00:27.202
Take it off.

00:00:27.602 --> 00:00:28.396
No.

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:35.898
You’re violating my rights, rule keeper.

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.783
Are you looking for something?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.640
Looking for the table of the traitor who moved to his old school, I guess.

00:00:44.235 --> 00:00:47.071
I’m sure he’s plotting something bad against our school.

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:49.638
And now there’re students protesting.

00:00:49.638 --> 00:00:52.487
If they join forces, I’m afraid we can’t handle them.

00:00:53.491 --> 00:00:56.892
Don’t you even think you can blind people,

00:00:56.892 --> 00:00:57.972
authoritarian.

00:00:57.972 --> 00:00:59.794
Did you get brainwashed by Teacher Dika?

00:00:59.794 --> 00:01:01.338
You are both rebellious.

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:02.880
That’s why he couldn’t be in this school.

00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:05.471
You’re tough on the outside.

00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:06.463
But on the inside…

00:01:07.118 --> 00:01:08.443
Will you stop or not?

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:11.551
Hey, don’t!

00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:17.359
What did you speak to them?

00:01:20.922 --> 00:01:21.784
Ayan.

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:25.484
What’s your secret deal with them?

00:01:25.484 --> 00:01:26.240
Reveal it.

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:29.525
You really want to know about that

00:01:30.312 --> 00:01:32.681
or want to have some alone time with me?

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:35.862
What a narcissist.

00:01:36.224 --> 00:01:37.905
Who would want to be close to you?

00:01:39.475 --> 00:01:40.424
Why not?

00:01:41.137 --> 00:01:43.220
What can be a problem if you’re close to me?

00:01:49.237 --> 00:01:50.171
Nothing.

00:01:50.663 --> 00:01:51.729
I feel nothing.

00:01:53.602 --> 00:01:55.000
Don’t come closer. I don’t like it.

00:01:55.565 --> 00:01:56.243
Really?

00:01:57.705 --> 00:01:58.734
Ayan!

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:00.270
What?

00:02:00.616 --> 00:02:03.329
You said you felt nothing being close to me.

00:02:06.976 --> 00:02:08.190
Don’t come closer

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.604
or I’ll hit you.

00:02:14.224 --> 00:02:14.981
Ouch!

00:02:17.131 --> 00:02:17.919
Let me see.

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:20.991
There.

00:02:21.473 --> 00:02:22.769
You’ve got a splinter.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.309
None of your business.

00:02:28.041 --> 00:02:29.039
What are you doing?

00:02:29.236 --> 00:02:30.000
Give me your hand.

00:02:31.148 --> 00:02:32.140
What are you doing?

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.800
Get the splinter out.

00:02:39.072 --> 00:02:41.072
Ayan, don’t!

00:02:42.436 --> 00:02:43.096
Scared?

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.247
Stay put.

00:02:45.502 --> 00:02:46.448
I’m not scared.

00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:48.313
Be still. I’m getting it out.

00:03:02.505 --> 00:03:03.245
Hey!

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:05.640
Where’s the ‘thank you?’

00:04:31.258 --> 00:04:35.371
Naphthalene consists of a fused pair of benzene rings.

00:04:35.483 --> 00:04:37.483
What’s its other name, students?

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:39.661
Smells bad.

00:04:40.128 --> 00:04:41.594
What smells bad?

00:04:41.595 --> 00:04:42.809
Wasuwat just farted, ma’am.

00:04:45.799 --> 00:04:46.956
Mothballs, ma’am.

00:04:46.956 --> 00:04:47.799
That’s correct.

00:04:57.214 --> 00:04:58.452
What are you staring at?

00:04:58.838 --> 00:05:00.000
Pay attention.

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.400
[Have you thanked me yet?]

00:05:23.738 --> 00:05:24.845
It’s not the time.

00:05:25.738 --> 00:05:26.877
Stay focused.

00:05:41.459 --> 00:05:44.172
If you can’t abide by the school rules,

00:05:44.481 --> 00:05:48.054
you will grow up to be law violators.

00:05:48.973 --> 00:05:49.925
Criminals.

00:05:51.277 --> 00:05:52.325
Got it?

00:05:52.325 --> 00:05:53.784
Yes, sir.

00:05:54.361 --> 00:05:59.728
Today, our representatives will lead us in reciting the pledge.

00:06:01.571 --> 00:06:02.489
Come in.

00:06:13.024 --> 00:06:14.631
You’ve got something to say?

00:06:17.581 --> 00:06:18.298
Well?

00:06:19.183 --> 00:06:21.040
Or do you want me to invite your parents here?

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.120
I…

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.957
I what?

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.045
Say it.

00:06:32.934 --> 00:06:35.155
Repeat it until it implants in your subconscious.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.634
Do it!

00:06:41.549 --> 00:06:43.680
I pledge…

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:44.526
Start over!

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:45.787
Together!

00:06:46.425 --> 00:06:53.635
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.358
Say it again.

00:06:55.518 --> 00:07:02.753
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:05.720
Now, everyone, say it together.

00:07:07.104 --> 00:07:07.857
Do it!

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:15.080
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:16.162
One more time.

00:07:19.582 --> 00:07:38.405
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:43.029
To prevent the curse and bad things from happening,

00:07:43.399 --> 00:07:46.579
we must unite as one

00:07:46.841 --> 00:07:48.890
and only strictly adhere to Suppalo’s rules.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:49.955
Got it?

00:07:50.295 --> 00:07:51.410
Yes, sir.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:52.321
Got it?

00:07:52.321 --> 00:07:53.475
Yes, sir.

00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:55.322
Recite the pledge again.

00:07:55.644 --> 00:08:01.748
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

00:08:01.748 --> 00:08:02.650
Again.

00:08:02.912 --> 00:08:09.090
I pledge to never again breach Suppalo's rules.

00:08:23.347 --> 00:08:29.082
The Prefect Club has awarded our school a long-standing prestigious reputation.

00:08:31.786 --> 00:08:32.520
You,

00:08:33.933 --> 00:08:36.520
as the club's current president,

00:08:36.794 --> 00:08:40.000
I hope the school's reputation isn’t ruined under your watch.

00:08:40.935 --> 00:08:41.927
Yes, sir.

00:08:43.558 --> 00:08:46.222
How is the new kid doing?

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.720
I think he came to mess with our school.

00:08:50.021 --> 00:08:54.120
Ever since he joined, ‘The World Remembers’ gang has never quit protesting

00:08:54.255 --> 00:08:56.427
regardless of how many times they've been affected by the curse.

00:08:58.736 --> 00:09:04.054
They have no idea what the curse will do if they keep on being stubborn.

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:16.327
(I pledge…)

00:09:16.327 --> 00:09:17.258
(Start over!)

00:09:18.734 --> 00:09:22.520
(I pledge…)

00:09:23.009 --> 00:09:25.009
Better keep your phone away.

00:09:26.952 --> 00:09:28.411
Students aren’t allowed to use it.

00:09:33.304 --> 00:09:35.427
This school is afraid its students will be smart or something?

00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:38.284
We won’t be here for long anyway.

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.771
If we can let it slide, we better do it.

00:09:42.961 --> 00:09:44.175
Let it slide?

00:09:45.362 --> 00:09:49.230
So you agree with me that the school rules are trash, don’t you?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.214
I’m not saying that.

00:09:51.853 --> 00:09:55.131
Whatever you disagree, say it.

00:09:57.832 --> 00:10:02.781
You have the right to stand by your own opinion.

00:10:03.292 --> 00:10:05.000
It’s even your duty to do so.

00:10:06.671 --> 00:10:07.983
Why are you playing it safe?

00:10:08.531 --> 00:10:09.720
I’m not playing it safe.

00:10:10.264 --> 00:10:11.822
I’m being neutral.

00:10:11.822 --> 00:10:13.096
Neutral?

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:17.201
This morning in the meeting room,

00:10:17.877 --> 00:10:21.696
you weren’t okay that the mean-spirited man publicly humiliated the other students.

00:10:21.696 --> 00:10:22.911
Were you okay with that?

00:10:23.457 --> 00:10:27.005
You know it well but choose to stay silent.

00:10:27.005 --> 00:10:28.429
You care about nothing.

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.169
To me, you’re not different than those power-crazed dictators.

00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:34.494
I…

00:10:34.494 --> 00:10:37.179
Your voice matters.

00:10:38.017 --> 00:10:41.418
You just need to say what you’re thinking.

00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:51.017
Aye.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.964
Aye!

00:10:55.379 --> 00:10:56.502
Aye, wait.

00:10:58.099 --> 00:10:58.976
Aye!

00:11:01.681 --> 00:11:04.246
What you just said, what does it mean?

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.100
Hey! What’s wrong with your guys?

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:24.739
Why making a grumpy face?

00:11:26.587 --> 00:11:30.258
Don’t tell me you’re jealous of Thua and Aye.

00:11:31.061 --> 00:11:33.233
You won’t stop accusing me of liking Thua, will you?

00:11:33.478 --> 00:11:34.410
You want a problem?

00:11:34.582 --> 00:11:35.453
What?

00:11:35.453 --> 00:11:39.079
If you don’t have a crush on him, why are you making that face?

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.634
I’m afraid Aye would mess with Thua’s head

00:11:45.806 --> 00:11:47.900
just like what he did to The World Remembers.

00:11:49.207 --> 00:11:50.470
Are you sure?

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.343
Yes.

00:11:52.638 --> 00:11:53.560
Ask Akk.

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:54.891
Aye is a head spinner, right?

00:11:55.259 --> 00:11:56.350
Right.

00:11:56.599 --> 00:11:58.200
I don’t know what he’s putting in Thua’s head.

00:12:00.547 --> 00:12:03.800
If you two want to know, why don’t we go ask them?

00:12:04.469 --> 00:12:05.384
- No.
- No.

00:12:06.195 --> 00:12:07.182
What?

00:12:07.182 --> 00:12:09.514
You want to know but don’t want to ask.

00:12:09.658 --> 00:12:11.855
And you think it all in your heads.

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.528
I'll ask him later.

00:12:14.528 --> 00:12:16.291
We’re making rounds here. Let’s go.

00:12:16.291 --> 00:12:17.108
What are you waiting for?

00:12:19.108 --> 00:12:20.100
Come.

00:12:25.195 --> 00:12:26.802
Thua. Aye.

00:12:26.802 --> 00:12:27.621
Kan and…

00:12:32.287 --> 00:12:33.314
What’s the matter with them?

00:12:34.395 --> 00:12:35.171
Exactly.

00:12:35.663 --> 00:12:36.454
No idea.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:39.999
Aye,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:46.006
you know you can’t say what you said to me to anyone else in this school, right?

00:12:48.697 --> 00:12:49.459
I know.

00:12:51.646 --> 00:12:52.442
Okay.

00:12:53.491 --> 00:12:54.904
I’ll go to the library now.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:55.922
Wait.

00:12:57.937 --> 00:12:59.151
Are you free this Saturday?

00:13:00.675 --> 00:13:01.427
Why?

00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.887
Get it under control, Akk.

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:10.216
Don’t let things get out of hand.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.320
So all this is just to threaten us?

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:16.816
The curse doesn’t have hands to do this.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.783
How about we hear what The World Remembers offers and find a way to compromise?

00:13:22.296 --> 00:13:24.566
I actually don’t like what that gang is doing.

00:13:25.921 --> 00:13:27.921
Do you think we can reverse the curse in time?

00:13:31.302 --> 00:13:33.376
I just came to see who you’re meeting.

00:13:34.377 --> 00:13:35.437
Who do you think I’m meeting?

00:13:36.223 --> 00:13:37.163
Aye.

00:13:37.567 --> 00:13:38.778
What if I’m meeting him?

00:13:39.294 --> 00:13:40.600
Do I need to be followed?

00:13:41.183 --> 00:13:42.470
I’m worried about you.

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.011
Here.

00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:15.224
Take a look.

00:14:17.161 --> 00:14:20.856
The protest video in our school is now on the internet.

00:14:20.962 --> 00:14:22.049
People are tweeting about it.

00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:25.386
The parents are not happy about this.

00:14:25.976 --> 00:14:31.785
Do you realize how damaging this could be to our reputation?

00:14:33.772 --> 00:14:36.533
We’re finding the way to handle this, principal.

00:14:36.664 --> 00:14:38.012
Fix it now.

00:14:38.687 --> 00:14:41.665
We can’t afford to lose more sponsors.

00:14:41.919 --> 00:14:42.876
Do you get it?

00:14:43.105 --> 00:14:43.975
Yes, ma’am.

00:14:53.594 --> 00:14:55.333
What are we going to do, sir?

00:14:58.147 --> 00:14:59.945
We must take drastic measures.

00:15:02.225 --> 00:15:04.660
How about we hear what The World Remembers offers

00:15:04.866 --> 00:15:06.866
and find a way to compromise?

00:15:07.535 --> 00:15:09.425
They should know we’re listening.

00:15:09.425 --> 00:15:10.185
Listening?

00:15:12.025 --> 00:15:13.395
Listening to those kids?

00:15:16.225 --> 00:15:17.022
All right then.

00:15:17.826 --> 00:15:20.507
You deal with them the way you see fit.

00:15:21.245 --> 00:15:24.266
As for me, I’ll deal with them my way.

00:15:31.277 --> 00:15:33.016
The social media age is garbage.

00:15:33.136 --> 00:15:35.136
This video has gone viral.

00:15:35.785 --> 00:15:36.748
From now on,

00:15:37.074 --> 00:15:38.980
if you see students using their phones in school,

00:15:39.156 --> 00:15:40.044
take it from them.

00:15:42.739 --> 00:15:43.742
Got it?

00:15:46.636 --> 00:15:47.549
Yes, sir.

00:15:48.603 --> 00:15:50.603
The new kid and that gang, what’s the news on them?

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:53.742
I do think he’s behind the gang’s protest.

00:15:54.026 --> 00:15:57.591
The other day, he said a few words and they followed his instructions.

00:15:58.085 --> 00:15:59.182
Get it under control, Akk.

00:15:59.877 --> 00:16:01.606
Don’t let things get out of hand.

00:16:03.393 --> 00:16:04.263
Yes, sir.

00:16:27.866 --> 00:16:28.922
What are you looking for?

00:16:29.465 --> 00:16:30.409
Need some help?

00:16:32.612 --> 00:16:33.467
It’s okay.

00:16:33.815 --> 00:16:34.851
I’ve got everything.

00:16:37.675 --> 00:16:41.044
You’re doing our group report, why didn’t you tell me?

00:16:44.197 --> 00:16:45.762
You always come to sleep.

00:16:46.236 --> 00:16:47.258
I can do it myself.

00:16:48.481 --> 00:16:51.611
Do you have any business with me following me here?

00:16:54.416 --> 00:16:56.416
I just came to see who you’re meeting.

00:16:57.413 --> 00:16:58.286
Who?

00:16:59.264 --> 00:17:00.391
Who do you think I’m meeting?

00:17:03.173 --> 00:17:03.957
Aye.

00:17:05.421 --> 00:17:06.536
What if I’m meeting him?

00:17:06.992 --> 00:17:08.312
Do I need to be followed?

00:17:08.894 --> 00:17:10.220
I’m worried about you.

00:17:12.861 --> 00:17:13.905
I mean…

00:17:14.176 --> 00:17:16.350
you should watch out for Aye.

00:17:17.747 --> 00:17:21.785
The teachers and Akk are suspecting he’s messing with our school.

00:17:25.209 --> 00:17:27.257
And you’re afraid I’d be affected by the curse?

00:17:27.345 --> 00:17:28.535
Like that gang?

00:17:29.703 --> 00:17:30.708
Hell, yeah.

00:17:31.208 --> 00:17:32.464
Your dad graduated here.

00:17:32.634 --> 00:17:34.178
You should know about this pretty well.

00:17:49.145 --> 00:17:51.145
Argh!

00:17:56.431 --> 00:17:57.705
Is that real blood?

00:17:57.705 --> 00:17:58.580
[Rules are there to break.]

00:17:58.580 --> 00:17:59.577
Shit!
[No to school uniform.]

00:18:00.041 --> 00:18:01.432
This is scary.
[Uniforms don’t make us smarter.]

00:18:01.432 --> 00:18:02.520
Must be the curse.

00:18:02.973 --> 00:18:04.104
When will you guys learn?

00:18:04.104 --> 00:18:06.537
Must be the curse.

00:18:06.537 --> 00:18:07.245
Oh, come on!

00:18:07.642 --> 00:18:08.838
No way.

00:18:09.153 --> 00:18:10.740
The curse, my ass.

00:18:11.146 --> 00:18:13.233
Someone is behind this.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:14.949
Who is?

00:18:16.209 --> 00:18:18.034
That’s blood.

00:18:19.879 --> 00:18:21.879
The curse, for sure.

00:18:22.661 --> 00:18:23.792
Guys.

00:19:01.312 --> 00:19:03.705
Is it because we broke the pledge?

00:19:03.705 --> 00:19:04.677
Nong!

00:19:04.677 --> 00:19:05.820
The pledge, my foot.

00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:07.262
I saw your fingers crossed when you said it.

00:19:07.817 --> 00:19:08.890
Are you guys nuts?

00:19:09.129 --> 00:19:10.599
Stop being paranoid.

00:19:10.917 --> 00:19:12.222
Especially you, Nong.

00:19:12.363 --> 00:19:14.146
Well, it’s really scary.

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:17.352
This means what you’re doing is working.

00:19:19.097 --> 00:19:21.785
It bothers someone’s allegiance to Suppalo so much

00:19:22.401 --> 00:19:24.032
that they threatened you.

00:19:24.748 --> 00:19:27.900
So all this is just to threaten us?

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:32.391
The curse doesn’t have hands to do this.

00:19:34.074 --> 00:19:35.726
Listen to that and stop being scared, Nong.

00:19:37.105 --> 00:19:40.985
They just want us to feel frightened and stop protesting.

00:19:41.372 --> 00:19:42.488
Are you guys frightened?

00:19:45.769 --> 00:19:50.239
If we are, we would already stop when the flower pot almost fell on us.

00:19:52.908 --> 00:19:58.624
Then I’m gonna need to send them a sign saying their threat didn’t work.

00:20:00.077 --> 00:20:05.380
Nong, Nian, it’s time we intensify our protest.

00:20:07.305 --> 00:20:08.284
Fight!

00:20:16.495 --> 00:20:18.745
I grouped these papers by rows.

00:20:18.745 --> 00:20:20.638
Take the one with your name on it and pass the rest to your friends.

00:20:20.932 --> 00:20:22.671
Yes, ma’am.

00:20:27.767 --> 00:20:28.572
That’s mine.

00:20:39.145 --> 00:20:41.145
Are we done yet?

00:20:45.526 --> 00:20:46.483
Okay.

00:20:46.483 --> 00:20:49.708
You have the aptitude test result for the next educational level, correct?

00:20:49.708 --> 00:20:52.751
I hope it matches the faculty you’re leaning towards.

00:20:52.904 --> 00:20:54.295
It does, perfectly.

00:20:57.837 --> 00:20:58.620
Guys.

00:21:04.178 --> 00:21:05.874
Have you been doing okay these days, Wat?

00:21:08.434 --> 00:21:09.425
Nothing is wrong.

00:21:10.577 --> 00:21:12.303
You can trust me.

00:21:13.687 --> 00:21:15.187
I’ve got nothing to say.

00:21:15.894 --> 00:21:18.155
My scores are great in every subject.

00:21:19.391 --> 00:21:20.301
Right.

00:21:20.823 --> 00:21:22.717
You’re perfect to be a student in the best class.

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.745
Nothing seems wrong.

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:28.716
But I don’t know why I feel like you’re unhappy.

00:21:34.768 --> 00:21:38.615
Maybe I’ve been studying so hard that I look tired.

00:21:41.946 --> 00:21:42.816
True.

00:21:43.206 --> 00:21:45.054
12 graders have loads of work to do.

00:21:45.945 --> 00:21:46.668
Yes.

00:21:49.694 --> 00:21:51.188
Is there anything else, ma’am?

00:21:51.785 --> 00:21:54.768
I’m meeting Akk and Kan after this.

00:21:58.658 --> 00:21:59.583
No.

00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.179
You are free to go.

00:22:03.896 --> 00:22:04.563
Yes, ma’am.

00:22:14.970 --> 00:22:19.491
The only thing we can do now is keep an eye on them.

00:22:19.885 --> 00:22:21.646
See what they’re plotting to do.

00:22:25.981 --> 00:22:27.199
What are you filming me for?

00:22:29.317 --> 00:22:30.774
Wow! New camera.

00:22:31.026 --> 00:22:32.461
Luxurious stuff.

00:22:33.243 --> 00:22:34.665
Be careful with it.

00:22:35.635 --> 00:22:37.635
Have you started your enrollment plan for Communication Arts already?

00:22:39.214 --> 00:22:39.974
No.

00:22:40.322 --> 00:22:41.025
What?

00:22:41.536 --> 00:22:43.080
Then why did you invest so much in it?

00:22:43.265 --> 00:22:46.656
I thought you’d use it to film a short film for your portfolio.

00:22:47.057 --> 00:22:48.340
Are you out of your mind?

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:50.062
My parents would murder me.

00:22:50.659 --> 00:22:53.246
My family tree is full of doctors and engineers.

00:22:55.182 --> 00:22:57.052
So we’ll be university students next year.

00:23:01.231 --> 00:23:04.035
We will finally be free from this insane curse.

00:23:07.742 --> 00:23:10.220
I actually don’t like what that gang is doing,

00:23:12.201 --> 00:23:13.853
but I don’t want anything to happen to them.

00:23:15.589 --> 00:23:17.589
Do you think we can reverse the curse in time?

00:23:21.233 --> 00:23:21.922
Of course.

00:23:22.379 --> 00:23:23.473
We can do it.

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.452
Film me.

00:23:36.884 --> 00:23:37.516
Go!

00:23:38.233 --> 00:23:39.225

and they’ll make up for the shit they did, Uncle.

00:24:12.361 --> 00:24:13.254
Get up!

How did you let it happen?

00:24:15.204 --> 00:24:17.345
The world has changed.

00:24:17.424 --> 00:24:20.054
Things are not as easy as they were in our seniors’ years.

00:24:20.409 --> 00:24:21.785
What are you going to do?

00:24:25.669 --> 00:24:27.126
I’ve come to remind you

00:24:27.289 --> 00:24:29.463
about the report for Teacher Waree’s class that we do together.

00:24:30.007 --> 00:24:31.071
Should we do it now?

00:24:32.007 --> 00:24:32.834
Let’s go.

Have you waited for long?

00:26:01.523 --> 00:26:03.027
No.

00:26:04.131 --> 00:26:05.489
If you’re hungry, you can order something first.

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:06.913
My treat.

00:26:08.673 --> 00:26:09.517
Thank you.

00:26:14.752 --> 00:26:17.152
Why are you holding that necklace like that, Uncle?

00:26:24.789 --> 00:26:26.030
It’s my technique.

00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:29.409
What technique?

00:26:33.217 --> 00:26:40.036
When I am anxious, not sure who I am, what I’m doing,

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:44.390
I always hold the necklace tight like this

00:26:46.207 --> 00:26:49.367
and tell myself it’s alright.

00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:51.930
Everything will be okay.

00:26:55.473 --> 00:26:58.153
And it works.

00:27:35.617 --> 00:27:37.617
I’m going to wreck Suppalo

00:27:39.667 --> 00:27:42.807
and they’ll make up for the shit they did, Uncle.

00:27:58.266 --> 00:28:03.828
Find the bad guys.

- Find the bad guys.
- Guys!

00:28:04.959 --> 00:28:05.927
Find the bad guys.

00:28:06.084 --> 00:28:08.084
Do not lie down here. It’s the hallway.

00:28:08.084 --> 00:28:09.364
Let’s take it inside.

00:28:09.583 --> 00:28:10.543
- Hey!
- Get up!

00:28:12.678 --> 00:28:13.700

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.798
No!

00:28:15.115 --> 00:28:16.015
No.

00:28:16.205 --> 00:28:18.005
If the school doesn’t catch the bad guys,

00:28:18.005 --> 00:28:19.903
that means this school supports crimes.

00:28:20.073 --> 00:28:22.473
And we will protest outside school too.

00:28:22.473 --> 00:28:24.107
We will tell every media station.

00:28:24.399 --> 00:28:28.479
Everyone will know this school uses violence against students who don’t agree with them.

00:28:28.479 --> 00:28:30.416
We will stay here.We will not go anywhere.

00:28:30.416 --> 00:28:31.364
We will be right here.

00:28:31.364 --> 00:28:32.615
Move to the gym instead.

00:28:32.837 --> 00:28:34.837
I will give you guys futons.

No.

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.733
No.

00:28:38.733 --> 00:28:40.090
We will stay here.

00:28:40.090 --> 00:28:41.116
We’ll stay right here.

We’re not going anywhere.

Be careful!

00:28:58.521 --> 00:29:01.001
Let me go!

00:29:18.921 --> 00:29:20.681
I attended the meeting in the city for a few hours.

00:29:21.407 --> 00:29:22.927
How did you let it happen?

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:26.140
I had no idea this was going to happen.

00:29:26.232 --> 00:29:29.552
The problem is not that you did know or did not.

00:29:29.552 --> 00:29:35.719
The problem is that after this incident happened, why did you take so long to resolve it?

00:29:37.385 --> 00:29:38.241
I…

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:43.144
I’m sorry.

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.860
Keep your apology to the principal and the school board.

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.380
They were so stubborn.

00:29:53.450 --> 00:29:55.270
Teacher Sani did her best.

00:29:56.593 --> 00:29:57.448
What about you guys?

00:29:58.128 --> 00:29:59.220
Did you do your best?

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:05.240
Do the prefect armbands you’re wearing remind you of your duty?

00:30:06.651 --> 00:30:08.651
I will deal with this as soon as possible, sir.

00:30:09.359 --> 00:30:11.159
Give us one more chance, Teacher.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:25.792
If you can't handle it,

00:30:26.372 --> 00:30:28.960
you can quit this prefect club president thing.

00:30:29.822 --> 00:30:30.447
I can.

00:30:30.887 --> 00:30:31.662
I can handle it.

00:30:32.605 --> 00:30:33.765
I must do it.

00:30:36.495 --> 00:30:37.389
I know that

00:30:38.349 --> 00:30:41.994
you’d always wanted to be a prefect.

00:30:42.372 --> 00:30:44.372
But the world has changed.

00:30:44.672 --> 00:30:47.212
Things are not as easy as they were in our seniors’ years.

00:30:47.412 --> 00:30:48.072
True.

00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:50.960
Back then, we didn’t dare talk back to the seniors.

00:30:51.472 --> 00:30:52.416
Look at things now.

00:30:53.256 --> 00:30:55.692
I warned them against smoking, and they punched me.

00:30:58.432 --> 00:30:59.144
I know.

00:31:00.524 --> 00:31:01.812
But this is challenging.

00:31:02.384 --> 00:31:04.324
We are the prefects now.

00:31:04.324 --> 00:31:06.262
If we can do it, that’d be really cool.

00:31:08.231 --> 00:31:09.831
We’re trying to reason with you here.

00:31:09.831 --> 00:31:11.028
Aren’t you gonna change your mind, Akk?

00:31:11.646 --> 00:31:12.264
No.

00:31:12.706 --> 00:31:14.220
I don’t change my mind so easily.

00:31:15.876 --> 00:31:17.216
What are you going to do then?

00:32:04.462 --> 00:32:05.556
Are you stalking me?

00:32:06.356 --> 00:32:07.002
No.

00:32:07.755 --> 00:32:08.678
I’m making rounds.

00:32:11.857 --> 00:32:13.594
I’ve come to remind you

00:32:13.893 --> 00:32:15.893
about the report for Teacher Waree’s class that we do together.

00:32:16.555 --> 00:32:18.395
I don’t want trouble just because you don’t turn it in.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.580
Ah!

00:32:23.989 --> 00:32:24.978
Should we do it now?

00:32:26.158 --> 00:32:27.609
Do the report at my house.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.220
I will work on my part and send you the file.

00:32:31.856 --> 00:32:32.787
No.

00:32:33.507 --> 00:32:34.416
Do it together.

00:32:35.052 --> 00:32:36.112
Get it done together.

00:32:40.597 --> 00:32:41.639
I said no.

00:32:41.719 --> 00:32:42.577
Why not?

00:32:43.413 --> 00:32:48.292
Are you scared of being alone with me?

00:32:51.114 --> 00:32:52.194
Scared, my ass.

00:32:53.834 --> 00:32:56.214
What can a small guy like you do?

00:32:56.334 --> 00:32:57.029
Exactly.

00:32:57.688 --> 00:32:58.568
No need to be scared.

00:32:59.668 --> 00:33:00.321
Come on.

00:33:13.429 --> 00:33:14.093
Oh!

00:33:15.073 --> 00:33:15.709
Sorry.

00:33:15.709 --> 00:33:16.274
Did I hurt you?

00:33:29.424 --> 00:33:30.464
What are you doing?

00:33:30.864 --> 00:33:32.604
Taking my clothes off for the shower.

00:33:43.456 --> 00:33:45.009
When you’re beat,

00:33:46.129 --> 00:33:47.409
you’re pretty cute.

00:34:05.265 --> 00:34:06.241
I can walk myself.

00:34:07.265 --> 00:34:08.512
But you're slow.

00:34:10.197 --> 00:34:11.037
Keep up.

00:34:21.959 --> 00:34:22.799
Are you afraid of me?

00:34:23.468 --> 00:34:24.628
I’m not.

00:34:28.339 --> 00:34:29.201
Take this.

00:34:38.643 --> 00:34:39.479
What’s wrong?

00:34:41.465 --> 00:34:43.743
Why are you tense every time you’re with me?

00:34:44.793 --> 00:34:45.583
I’m not.

00:34:45.717 --> 00:34:46.927
Oh, not at all.

00:34:47.001 --> 00:34:48.543
Your shoulders are up so high.

00:34:48.543 --> 00:34:49.535
Not tense at all.

00:34:51.974 --> 00:34:53.796
I’m just stretching my shoulders.

00:34:53.796 --> 00:34:54.926
I’m not tense.

00:34:56.265 --> 00:34:56.903
Oh!

00:34:57.008 --> 00:34:58.556
Sorry. Did I hurt you?

00:35:09.751 --> 00:35:11.260
What the heck…are you doing?

00:35:19.363 --> 00:35:20.515
What did you think I’d do?

00:35:34.422 --> 00:35:35.797
Why raising your shoulders again?

00:35:37.179 --> 00:35:38.019
Just fatigue.

00:35:54.867 --> 00:35:55.870
Do you live alone?

00:35:56.986 --> 00:35:57.783
Yeah.

00:36:03.962 --> 00:36:05.605
You’re pretty nosy.

00:36:24.219 --> 00:36:25.297
I’m going to take a shower.

00:36:25.766 --> 00:36:26.688
My skin feels sticky.

00:36:27.263 --> 00:36:28.065
Wait.

00:36:29.604 --> 00:36:30.467
What?

00:36:32.059 --> 00:36:33.257
Do you want to take a shower with me?

00:36:34.194 --> 00:36:35.375
Just go take a shower.

00:36:35.616 --> 00:36:36.612
Stop wasting my time.

00:36:49.088 --> 00:36:50.000
What are you doing?

00:36:50.513 --> 00:36:52.293
Taking my clothes off for the shower.

00:37:02.007 --> 00:37:03.472
Why are you doing it here?

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:05.558
Do it in the bathroom.

00:37:06.543 --> 00:37:07.318
Hey,

00:37:07.452 --> 00:37:08.677
it’s my house.

00:37:09.616 --> 00:37:10.913
I can take my clothes off anywhere.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.350
That’s not much to show off.

00:37:18.038 --> 00:37:20.038
Don’t make me drag you to the bathroom too.

00:37:32.219 --> 00:37:33.126
(Wanna come in?)

00:37:34.401 --> 00:37:35.843
Just take a shower, Tiny.

00:37:36.409 --> 00:37:37.227
(Asshole!)

00:38:43.805 --> 00:38:44.549
Akk.

00:38:46.343 --> 00:38:47.421
What are you doing with my stuff?

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:50.063
Stay out of it.

00:40:29.025 --> 00:40:30.509
When you’re beat,

00:40:31.558 --> 00:40:32.989
you’re pretty cute.

00:41:09.546 --> 00:41:10.720
What are you doing to me?

00:41:12.971 --> 00:41:15.306
If I’m to do something, I won’t do it when you’re asleep.

00:41:16.622 --> 00:41:17.446
It won’t be fun.

00:41:22.317 --> 00:41:23.225
I’m leaving.

00:41:23.703 --> 00:41:24.795
Sleepy.

00:41:25.428 --> 00:41:27.428
I’ll take it all from here.

00:41:28.191 --> 00:41:29.332
Why are you leaving?

00:41:29.957 --> 00:41:31.285
It’s late. Crash here.

00:41:32.117 --> 00:41:32.949
No.

00:41:33.917 --> 00:41:35.114
I told Kan to pick me up.

00:42:00.028 --> 00:42:02.028
Did you find anything suspicious?

00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:03.915
Not yet.

00:42:03.915 --> 00:42:06.486
He was shadowing me. I didn’t have a chance to look.

00:42:06.616 --> 00:42:07.420
I’m pissed.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:11.003
If people find out you’re getting close to him, it won’t be good.

00:42:11.634 --> 00:42:12.412
I know.

00:42:12.947 --> 00:42:14.504
I don’t want to be close to him.

00:42:14.639 --> 00:42:16.260
I’m sick of seeing his face.

00:42:16.652 --> 00:42:18.161
Really want to kick his ass.

00:42:18.161 --> 00:42:19.626
I dislike him too.

00:42:19.627 --> 00:42:21.627
Especially now that he’s messing with Thua.

00:42:21.723 --> 00:42:23.277
Honestly, I don’t trust him.

00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:25.899
If you’re going to kick his ass, kick it one more time for me.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:27.197
Kick hard.

00:42:27.783 --> 00:42:29.128
Sure.

00:42:29.756 --> 00:42:30.823
Wait and see.

00:42:31.151 --> 00:42:34.780
I’m going to find the evidence and expose his plan to ruin our school.

00:42:35.067 --> 00:42:38.138
If I find it, he’ll be expelled.

00:42:38.465 --> 00:42:40.264
Where will you find it?

00:43:30.733 --> 00:43:31.930
I volunteer.

00:43:34.303 --> 00:43:35.768
What a narcissist.

00:43:36.104 --> 00:43:37.783
Who would want to be close to you?

00:43:38.604 --> 00:43:39.533
Why not?

00:43:40.347 --> 00:43:42.347
What can be a problem if you’re close to me?

00:43:50.221 --> 00:43:55.724
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

00:43:56.317 --> 00:43:58.943
I have no clue what you’re doing.

00:43:59.155 --> 00:44:01.244
But if I were you, I’d stop.

00:44:01.392 --> 00:44:03.727
We found nothing because we only follow him inside school.

00:44:03.727 --> 00:44:05.042
What if we follow him outside school?

00:44:05.286 --> 00:44:07.783
For a student with high self-confidence like Ayan,

00:44:07.783 --> 00:44:11.028
we, as teachers, should prepare him some polishing process.

00:44:11.028 --> 00:44:12.852
You normally don’t yield easily.

00:44:12.943 --> 00:44:14.943
Why did you let them do so much to you?

00:44:15.473 --> 00:44:17.607
You won’t be so mean to me too, right?

00:44:18.423 --> 00:44:20.021
Why don’t you talk to me these days?

00:44:20.387 --> 00:44:23.034
Because you’re uncomfortable when I’m around.

00:44:23.034 --> 00:44:24.856
Is it weird that two male friends take a shower together?
