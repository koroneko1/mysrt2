1
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:30,207
In B.E. 2483,

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,832
the nation descended into a dark age.

3
00:01:34,957 --> 00:01:37,417
People struggled with great adversity.

4
00:01:38,417 --> 00:01:40,500
The bureaucracy was corrupt.

5
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:44,417
Rumors about the next world war

6
00:01:45,082 --> 00:01:46,667
and Japan's plans for invasion

7
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,832
had people living in terror.

8
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,917
The government continued
its nationalist propaganda

9
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,082
while the whole country

10
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:01,292
was falling apart.
All hell was breaking loose.

11
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:07,457
Failed by legal systems,
the oppressed chose the life of banditry.

12
00:02:07,625 --> 00:02:11,957
New cliques and gangs emerged.
Criminals could be found everywhere.

13
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:15,417
One of the most notorious outlaws

14
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:17,625
was an ethnic separatist

15
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:20,875
named Alhawi Yalu.

16
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,832
Master of sorcery. Local people called him

17
00:02:25,375 --> 00:02:27,750
the devil of Budo mountain.

18
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:35,207
Police Lt. Khun Puntharak Rajjadej,

19
00:02:35,917 --> 00:02:39,542
I called you here today
because I wanted to ask you a favor

20
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,957
regarding the Budo mountain case.

21
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,417
Alhawi Yalu is getting more powerful.

22
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:52,957
He almost has the whole
mountain area under control.

23
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:59,042
I want to send you undercover
for half a year.

24
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:05,082
Once the new inspector arrives,
your job is done.

25
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:08,292
You understand the conditions?

26
00:03:11,292 --> 00:03:12,457
Yes, sir.

27
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,875
Since it's a secret mission,

28
00:03:16,957 --> 00:03:18,582
no backup.

29
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:21,542
This means...

30
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:24,750
I may not come back.

31
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,792
Criminals are everywhere

32
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:32,167
and yet we can't bring them to justice.

33
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,875
This is our fate now.

34
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:37,542
We can't tell what will happen next

35
00:03:38,457 --> 00:03:40,957
or who we will become.

36
00:03:45,082 --> 00:03:48,457
Do you think you can change that?

37
00:03:57,542 --> 00:03:59,542
BUDO MOUNTAIN

38
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:03,207
Alhawi's army

39
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,500
spreads out across the region.

40
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:08,667
His left and right-hand men,

41
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:11,125
also with great knowledge of sorcery,

42
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,125
are as dangerous as their master.

43
00:04:14,707 --> 00:04:15,665
Suea Sang...

44
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,541
SUEA SANG

45
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:19,833
...and Suea Grub Kamtong.

46
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:21,041
SUEA GRUB KAMTONG

47
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:28,416
May 11, B.E. 2483,

48
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,375
my unit, led by Inspector Issara,

49
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,333
was going to dismantle
Suea Grub Kamtong's gang.

50
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:42,333
Instead, we were surrounded
by his henchmen.

51
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:44,166
Inspector Issara was shot.

52
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,291
Inspector, let me see.

53
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,708
Dammit! Aren't they tired of firing?

54
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,541
Hey! Hey!

55
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:05,000
Stop!

56
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,125
This is the police! Come out!
We have you surrounded.

57
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,083
Am I going to see my child?

58
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:29,125
I still don't know
what to name him. Any ideas?

59
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:30,958
Name?

60
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:32,708
What about Joy?

61
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,040
-Joy?
-Hey, it's a good name.

62
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:37,291
Enough with that!

63
00:05:37,875 --> 00:05:39,083
I need cigarettes.

64
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:43,666
Hey! Do you have some?

65
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,166
-This is the last pack.
-Throw it over.

66
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,665
Ugh, what a terrible throw!

67
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,166
-Go get it.
-Yes, sir.

68
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:54,500
Cover me! Cover me!

69
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,083
Go help him. I'll cover you.

70
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,166
Go!

71
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:16,666
Deputy, they're coming in closer.

72
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:18,791
They intend to block us in.

73
00:06:19,875 --> 00:06:21,083
We're not gonna make it.

74
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,125
Look! Kids over there.

75
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,333
I'll cover. You go help them.

76
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,291
I'll go. You cover me.

77
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:39,791
Noon!

78
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,666
We just want Khun Pun.

79
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,875
-Come out, or I'll kill them all.
-Lieutenant, you heard him.

80
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:54,041
If you don't go out, we'll die.

81
00:07:07,875 --> 00:07:09,208
That's me. Khun Pun.

82
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,458
YANTRA TATTOOS

83
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,083
Noon!

84
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:23,708
Noon!

85
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,125
Fire in the hole!

86
00:08:49,957 --> 00:08:52,832
I take refuge in Buddha.

87
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:55,292
I take refuge in Dharma.

88
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,875
I take refuge in Sangha.

89
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:03,832
Bless me with the power of the mind.

90
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:08,375
What should we do? They got the inspector.

91
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,707
How many bullets?

92
00:09:16,332 --> 00:09:18,000
-I have four.
-I have three.

93
00:09:19,167 --> 00:09:21,000
All right then. I'm going to help him.

94
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,707
I'll run towards them.
You follow my signals and shoot.

95
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,292
-Understood?
-Yes, sir!

96
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:46,792
-Lieutenant, stop right there!
-One more step,

97
00:09:47,167 --> 00:09:49,082
I'll blow his brains out.

98
00:10:01,707 --> 00:10:04,207
Bullets were flying everywhere.

99
00:10:04,707 --> 00:10:06,207
I lost many officers.

100
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,875
At that point, I thought
I had to surrender myself.

101
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:13,542
He had a gun pointed to my head.
He was going to pull the trigger.

102
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,500
What were you thinking?

103
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:18,667
I could have been killed!

104
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:26,917
This hurts so damn much.

105
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,750
Inspector Issara was praised
for taking down Suea Grub's gang.

106
00:10:43,082 --> 00:10:46,957
He pulled enough strings to get promoted

107
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,000
and got sent back to Bangkok.

108
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:54,792
Meanwhile,

109
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:56,707
I'm on my way to meet him.

110
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:58,875
Alhawi Yalu.

111
00:11:17,207 --> 00:11:21,582
Beards that turn to copper
and livers that turn to iron.

112
00:11:22,332 --> 00:11:26,667
Things like these are very powerful,

113
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:30,125
and can only be in the possession
of true masters,

114
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,750
the perfected ones.

115
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,457
How did you get them?

116
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,250
None of your business.

117
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:46,957
There's still a tooth in the roof of
the mouth to complete the sacred trinity.

118
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:38,832
Venerable sir,

119
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,332
did you know

120
00:12:43,792 --> 00:12:45,582
I ordered my men to dig up your past?

121
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:47,750
I know that

122
00:12:50,082 --> 00:12:51,082
you were a cop.

123
00:13:14,957 --> 00:13:17,957
The one thing I don't have yet,

124
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,750
it's in your mouth.

125
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:25,375
People who know sorcery
can still be killed by a lance, right?

126
00:13:26,707 --> 00:13:27,582
So...

127
00:13:28,707 --> 00:13:29,792
your tooth,

128
00:13:34,332 --> 00:13:35,457
just let me have it.

129
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:03,542
I've been thinking over and over
about running for election.

130
00:14:04,207 --> 00:14:07,417
-Well, I'm interested.
-If you do,

131
00:14:08,707 --> 00:14:12,000
I'm sure you can win.
You don't have to worry at all.

132
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:18,957
As long as you ignore what's going on
regarding our opium trade.

133
00:14:20,082 --> 00:14:21,207
Sir,

134
00:14:21,457 --> 00:14:23,417
are you trying
to bribe a government official?

135
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:27,082
L... Luang, sir...

136
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,082
Luang, sir,

137
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,500
by the way,

138
00:14:36,042 --> 00:14:41,542
I heard that they're sending
the new inspector general to station here.

139
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:51,125
I'm afraid--

140
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:57,625
You know this is a remote area.
Who would bother inspecting anything?

141
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,000
It's full of bandits and criminals.

142
00:15:29,082 --> 00:15:30,417
PUBLIC SECURITY POLICE

143
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:06,750
Hey!

144
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:28,375
On September 13, Luang Phadej,
the newly assigned inspector

145
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:32,500
was attacked by Alhawi's guerrillas.

146
00:16:33,457 --> 00:16:37,667
Almost the whole unit was killed.
Only two could make it out.

147
00:16:55,792 --> 00:17:01,625
Come and hear me,
The story of our hometown...

148
00:17:01,957 --> 00:17:05,500
I was trying to reach out to
the two officers but to no avail.

149
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:12,291
I have no idea what happened to them
or what's going to happen to me.

150
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,250
My guess is that

151
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:18,125
the government loses credibility
and way too much money for this.

152
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,375
There will be no reinforcements
after the attack.

153
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:28,125
I'm on my own. Nobody
gives a damn about this town.

154
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:35,416
Nobody wants to come near a place
where everyone is an outlaw.

155
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:39,875
I will withdraw from this mission
if I can answer this for myself:

156
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,750
what made them choose to be criminals

157
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,208
and what made me choose to be a policeman?

158
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,333
I guess Mali likes you, But.

159
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:59,416
Amidst the sea,
I watch the moon at night.

160
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:06,291
It reminds me of my love who is far away.

161
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,458
Did my horse scare off your fish?

162
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,208
No, sir.

163
00:18:57,583 --> 00:18:59,416
Even if your horse comes down to the pond,

164
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,333
the fish won't take the bait.

165
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,291
There's just small fish in this pond.

166
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,875
But master, I heard that

167
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,583
there's this giant fish in here.

168
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:13,458
Goatherder,

169
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:17,083
you plan to catch
a giant fish with this tiny hook?

170
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,958
I just want to see it.

171
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:26,083
Even if I have to dive, I'd do it.

172
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:29,041
Every part of the Budo mountain range

173
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:30,708
is under my protection.

174
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:35,166
But go on. You are allowed
to catch some fish.

175
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,208
This is my bet.

176
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:45,708
If you can catch a big fish
with that tiny hook of yours,

177
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,625
you can keep it.

178
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,416
But if you can't, the next time I see you,

179
00:19:55,166 --> 00:19:57,416
I'm gonna need that back.

180
00:19:58,875 --> 00:19:59,916
Yes, master.

181
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,416
SUB-DISTRICT KUANLAY POLICE STATION

182
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:27,916
Let's go!

183
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:33,791
-Inspector!
-What's going on?

184
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:41,791
Mr. Oo told the police that Kheaw
and Samae abducted and raped his daughter.

185
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,875
I chased after them
and brought them here, sir.

186
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,000
Hey!

187
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:57,000
How much have you got?

188
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,625
-Two baht.
-You?

189
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:00,833
Five baht.

190
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,958
Hand it over.

191
00:21:09,375 --> 00:21:10,333
Here, Inspector.

192
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:14,833
So broke.

193
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,416
Keep the money. It's a reparation.

194
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:24,708
You can go home now.

195
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:31,041
Inspector, how can you do that?

196
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,666
Bang, lock him up until he calms down.

197
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:41,250
Bang! I'm an officer!
The suspects are standing right there!

198
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,875
Bang!

199
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:56,375
Who do you think you are?

200
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:05,125
Phueak.

201
00:22:08,208 --> 00:22:11,750
Those two work for the Ivory Club.

202
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:15,375
Luang Olan's men. If we arrest them,

203
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,208
Mr. Oo's family won't be alive tomorrow.

204
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,208
Do you understand?

205
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:38,583
Remember, you work for me now.
Do as I say. No questions asked.

206
00:22:38,708 --> 00:22:42,250
I'm going to keep
your payments for two months.

207
00:22:42,666 --> 00:22:45,166
That's a hundred baht
for an acceptance fee.

208
00:22:46,041 --> 00:22:48,583
I'll introduce you as my distant relative.

209
00:22:49,208 --> 00:22:53,833
Don't tell anyone you're not
from around here. Just keep quiet.

210
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:56,541
Especially with the locals.
Stay in your lane. Understand?

211
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,083
Keep your head down, your mouth shut.
Otherwise, you're gonna get killed.

212
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:05,541
That's it. Oh, let's push.

213
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,916
Good. You have to pay me for this.
Another month of your payment.

214
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:14,916
Go away!

215
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:19,333
Go away! Shoo!

216
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,791
Please, Monsieur le Consul.
I am so honored.

217
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,666
Hello, Mr. Paul.

218
00:23:29,708 --> 00:23:34,791
This is monsieur Jean Pierre,
the consul of France.

219
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:41,750
Thank you for your invitation, Mr. Olan.

220
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:44,375
You are such a great host.

221
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:49,666
Do you know anything
about the spies in Thailand?

222
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:55,040
There're plenty of boats
in the Gulf of Thailand.

223
00:23:55,125 --> 00:23:59,583
Most of them belong to the Chinese,
not the Japanese.

224
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:04,666
I take it you're exhausted
from the long journey.

225
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:08,208
I've prepared
some pretty masseuses for you.

226
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:13,291
-You take such a good care of me. Cheers.
-Cheers.

227
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:05,625
You have a lighter?

228
00:25:13,708 --> 00:25:14,583
You can keep it.

229
00:25:18,375 --> 00:25:19,291
Thanks.

230
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:27,958
Wow! But!

231
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:31,541
You look so handsome in this uniform.

232
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:35,125
-Khaitoh took you to work then?
-Yes.

233
00:25:35,291 --> 00:25:36,916
Let's go to the club.

234
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,375
I'm about to go on stage.

235
00:25:40,083 --> 00:25:41,166
Want to watch?

236
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:45,625
-I don't think I can do that.
-It's all right. Come with me.

237
00:25:46,166 --> 00:25:48,250
The show is about to begin.

238
00:25:56,875 --> 00:26:03,833
The moon shines bright
On the shore at night

239
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:09,458
Lights up the sky

240
00:26:10,333 --> 00:26:13,958
How beautiful

241
00:26:14,625 --> 00:26:21,583
Cool breezes whisper as river flows

242
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:29,875
The soft sounds wander
Under the moonlight

243
00:26:31,083 --> 00:26:35,125
Hear the birds sing

244
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:40,458
Deep in the woods
Whose song is this?

245
00:26:43,416 --> 00:26:47,833
Oh, it belongs
To the night birds and cicadas

246
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:52,750
Happily they perform

247
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:58,583
Sweet smells the wind brings

248
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:03,500
From flowers as the birds sing

249
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:09,250
Their song helps me remind myself

250
00:27:09,583 --> 00:27:14,125
That love awaits

251
00:27:16,208 --> 00:27:23,208
The moon shines bright
On the shore at night

252
00:27:24,708 --> 00:27:28,916
What will happen next

253
00:27:30,791 --> 00:27:35,791
I don't know

254
00:27:46,708 --> 00:27:48,125
You did a wonderful job tonight.

255
00:27:49,791 --> 00:27:51,458
You don't have to say that.

256
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:01,791
Why wouldn't I?

257
00:28:36,708 --> 00:28:37,666
Why did they do it?

258
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:40,750
Don't you know?
His rice fields were seized.

259
00:28:41,416 --> 00:28:43,125
Those two rascals from the club

260
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:45,041
raped Hong, his daughter.

261
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:50,333
Hong was dead, so Luea hung herself.

262
00:28:52,708 --> 00:28:53,875
Take them to the temple.

263
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:14,375
Tell me right now.

264
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:18,208
No way!

265
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,541
I found them in a canal.

266
00:29:39,791 --> 00:29:41,000
They haven't said a word.

267
00:29:47,208 --> 00:29:48,125
I am

268
00:29:49,458 --> 00:29:50,708
Alhawi Yalu.

269
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,208
Alhawi Yalu.

270
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,875
Do you know the meaning?

271
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:01,375
That you're a criminal.

272
00:30:10,041 --> 00:30:10,916
My name means

273
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:14,083
a deep dark endless abyss.

274
00:30:15,041 --> 00:30:17,791
Whoever falls down there
will never come back up.

275
00:30:20,041 --> 00:30:23,166
Now tell me what you were planning

276
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:24,333
on doing here?

277
00:30:27,041 --> 00:30:29,125
I'm not telling you!

278
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:32,083
Die!

279
00:30:43,291 --> 00:30:44,166
Sergeant!

280
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:48,625
Sergeant!

281
00:30:56,166 --> 00:30:57,541
What are you doing?

282
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:02,291
No! Sergeant!

283
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,666
Sergeant!

284
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:11,750
I'll tell you! I'll tell you!

285
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:17,166
We were ordered to find an officer
sent to infiltrate here.

286
00:31:18,916 --> 00:31:21,333
He was the one
who killed Suea Grub Kamtong.

287
00:31:25,375 --> 00:31:26,666
His name was Khun Pun.

288
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,458
-Khun Pun.
-Please don't kill me.

289
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,375
You.

290
00:31:44,958 --> 00:31:51,708
This Khun Pun is immortal.
He's gonna cut all your heads off.

291
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,083
What is it?

292
00:32:00,458 --> 00:32:02,208
I want 20 bags of rice,

293
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:06,208
20 cows and 10 buffaloes.
Send them to my father and tell him that,

294
00:32:07,166 --> 00:32:08,583
"I still want to serve you.”

295
00:32:09,291 --> 00:32:10,458
You came here for this?

296
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:12,500
I have presents for you.

297
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:14,583
Behind the couch.

298
00:32:23,125 --> 00:32:24,375
What the fuck is this?

299
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,791
-They were undercover cops.
-Why did you bring them here?

300
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:30,958
There's still another.

301
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,291
Hang their bodies in town.

302
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:36,583
This means war.

303
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,333
I want you to help me find him.

304
00:32:57,041 --> 00:32:58,041
Bring him in alive.

305
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:48,500
Let me be invisible.

306
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,375
Yes?

307
00:34:15,208 --> 00:34:18,208
Oh, good evening, inspector.

308
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,416
We got a report about
a criminal infiltrating into our area.

309
00:34:24,005 --> 00:34:25,108
We are doing a house search.

310
00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:43,708
Who is this?

311
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,833
He's my relative from Punpin.

312
00:34:48,166 --> 00:34:53,666
Father's dead, mother's sick.
So I took him to work with me at the club.

313
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:59,458
Thanks everyone for your cooperation.

314
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:05,458
You. Get an umbrella and walk me outside.

315
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,791
Tell me who you are...

316
00:35:44,791 --> 00:35:46,333
or I'll shoot!

317
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:43,250
I'm Police Lt. Khun Puntharak Rajjadej,

318
00:36:44,041 --> 00:36:45,625
assigned by the government

319
00:36:46,291 --> 00:36:47,750
to disband the bandits here.

320
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:53,666
I suggest you get out of here soon.

321
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:57,041
There's a thing about this town.

322
00:36:58,166 --> 00:36:59,833
Authorities are in the wrong.

323
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:02,166
If you're hunting for them,

324
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:04,875
they're hunting for you.

325
00:37:07,875 --> 00:37:08,750
Trust me.

326
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:10,916
If you want to live,

327
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
leave this town.

328
00:37:14,166 --> 00:37:16,000
This is all I can help you with.

329
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,625
Let's go.

330
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,458
Bird battle field

331
00:37:33,541 --> 00:37:35,833
was created to entertain important guests

332
00:37:37,083 --> 00:37:38,708
and is run by Suea Sang.

333
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:42,750
What I gathered from there

334
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,875
was that Alhawi's father is still alive.

335
00:37:47,916 --> 00:37:54,416
The best way I can learn about
the devil is from his own father.

336
00:38:04,625 --> 00:38:05,791
It's all my fault.

337
00:38:07,208 --> 00:38:09,583
Alhawi is a result of my own karma.

338
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,083
I once was a bandit, a murderer.

339
00:38:15,583 --> 00:38:18,083
Alhawi idolized me,
wanted to follow my footsteps.

340
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:24,625
You know, the name Raya Gaji
has a special meaning.

341
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:29,625
It means someone who's small
but a dangerous fighter.

342
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:33,916
I want to be as great as Raya Gaji.

343
00:38:34,875 --> 00:38:37,958
-Can I be Raya Gaji as well?
-Of course you can.

344
00:38:38,625 --> 00:38:40,375
Then I was arrested.

345
00:38:41,166 --> 00:38:43,166
I wanted to wash the blood off my hands.

346
00:38:46,208 --> 00:38:51,333
But you can never get away from it.
You never feel clean.

347
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,875
Once a thief, always a thief.

348
00:39:15,708 --> 00:39:17,333
I remember the look in his eyes,

349
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,458
the look of someone who had no faith left,

350
00:39:22,125 --> 00:39:23,083
especially

351
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,750
in myself, his own father.

352
00:39:28,583 --> 00:39:30,125
Raya Gaji, my son.

353
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,291
Hey, Malai.

354
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:54,250
Where's your dress?

355
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:57,250
You wanted to see me?

356
00:39:58,625 --> 00:39:59,541
I know

357
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,208
you are a cop.

358
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:04,833
I saw you paying respect
to those two cops.

359
00:40:06,166 --> 00:40:07,166
I'm so sorry.

360
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,666
Malai!

361
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,375
Go!

362
00:41:31,291 --> 00:41:32,166
Let's go!

363
00:42:04,333 --> 00:42:06,291
You got some magic
up your sleeve too, huh?

364
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,666
Do you know why I hate the police so much?

365
00:42:19,791 --> 00:42:22,583
Because you people are evil leeches!

366
00:42:47,375 --> 00:42:48,250
Let's go!

367
00:43:15,916 --> 00:43:17,000
Hello, sir!

368
00:43:23,791 --> 00:43:29,375
This man is not a consul
but a spy from France.

369
00:43:30,291 --> 00:43:33,333
I want you to make sure that

370
00:43:33,833 --> 00:43:37,333
no one gets in the way
of the Imperial Army.

371
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:42,541
You can tell your men to get drunk
and wait for the good news.

372
00:43:43,708 --> 00:43:47,250
I heard your troops have arrived
on Vietnam's coast, right?

373
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,000
I have something for you, Malai.

374
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:01,791
What's the occasion?

375
00:44:03,458 --> 00:44:06,708
It seems to me that
you're the French consul's favorite.

376
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:13,916
Inside the bezel there is a potion.

377
00:44:16,458 --> 00:44:17,458
Slip it into his drink.

378
00:44:19,375 --> 00:44:20,291
Get it done,

379
00:44:21,916 --> 00:44:25,041
and I'll forgive every single baht
of your brother's debt.

380
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:32,958
And this...

381
00:44:40,583 --> 00:44:42,916
is for my affection for you.

382
00:44:55,666 --> 00:44:56,666
Now get out.

383
00:45:08,125 --> 00:45:09,916
Why do you want him dead?

384
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,166
He's an opportunist.

385
00:45:13,583 --> 00:45:14,875
I'll take care of him.

386
00:45:16,291 --> 00:45:17,416
Not by force.

387
00:45:18,333 --> 00:45:21,541
People will notice.
I don't want to draw attention to me.

388
00:45:26,125 --> 00:45:27,250
Master,

389
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:30,500
if the trains arrive as you said,

390
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:33,708
everyone will have a better life, right?

391
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,041
Of course.

392
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:43,250
The economy will prosper.

393
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:45,708
People won't be in debt.

394
00:45:46,958 --> 00:45:48,125
You won't have to plunder.

395
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:55,791
So if I ask you if there are
many Japanese around here...

396
00:45:59,125 --> 00:46:00,500
I'd rather have a whisky.

397
00:46:58,625 --> 00:47:00,375
Fuck... What's happening to me? Fuck...

398
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:32,208
Thanks, Bu-nga.

399
00:48:34,333 --> 00:48:35,875
If I find out you're in debt again

400
00:48:36,791 --> 00:48:38,833
and have Malai pay it off for you,

401
00:48:40,666 --> 00:48:43,083
I'll slit your throat.

402
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:52,416
Malai.

403
00:48:56,125 --> 00:48:58,708
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

404
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:01,750
It's all right.

405
00:49:03,458 --> 00:49:05,750
At least we're not in debt anymore.

406
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,125
Who's inside? Come on out!

407
00:49:17,250 --> 00:49:18,458
-Hurry!
-Let's go.

408
00:49:25,916 --> 00:49:26,958
Hurry!

409
00:49:31,958 --> 00:49:32,833
But!

410
00:49:34,083 --> 00:49:36,791
This man, But, is Khun Puntarak Rajjadej.

411
00:49:37,416 --> 00:49:41,375
He was appointed to station here
as the new inspector.

412
00:49:43,375 --> 00:49:45,541
All right, then. However,

413
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:50,625
we have to hide him for now.
We'll talk later when he's conscious.

414
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,333
Everyone please take care of him.
We have got to go.

415
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:02,083
Khaitoh, But is a cop?

416
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:06,500
Why didn't you tell us?
You want us to die?

417
00:50:06,666 --> 00:50:10,375
-Yeah, right?
-If Suea Sang knows

418
00:50:11,416 --> 00:50:13,000
that you've been hiding a cop,

419
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:15,750
-what's going to happen?
-You know that

420
00:50:16,416 --> 00:50:20,291
-they won't let us get away with this.
-Yeah. Yeah.

421
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:21,750
Take him.

422
00:50:22,541 --> 00:50:25,000
Drop him at the club. Glum, do it.

423
00:50:25,333 --> 00:50:28,250
Come on! Go! Move!

424
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:33,125
-Stop! Stop!
-Hey! Stop him!

425
00:50:33,958 --> 00:50:35,833
-Khaitoh!
-You think a person like me

426
00:50:37,041 --> 00:50:38,500
would want to get us into trouble?

427
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,541
And the fact that he's a cop,

428
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:43,625
I just found out too.

429
00:50:44,208 --> 00:50:45,083
Khaitoh.

430
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,416
You can talk all you want.

431
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:53,291
Aren't you the one who sold
your sister to settle your debt?

432
00:50:53,791 --> 00:50:57,291
You're lucky they haven't
blown your brains out yet.

433
00:50:59,375 --> 00:51:01,083
Oh, you think I'm the only one

434
00:51:02,458 --> 00:51:03,625
who borrows from him?

435
00:51:05,791 --> 00:51:07,666
Everyone in this village is in debt.

436
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,291
I don't want anyone
to trade off their lives for Luang Olan.

437
00:51:14,083 --> 00:51:14,958
Back then,

438
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:17,791
no matter how tired,

439
00:51:19,541 --> 00:51:20,416
we'd go to sea.

440
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:24,666
Look at us these days.

441
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,333
Now,

442
00:51:27,875 --> 00:51:29,333
the sea's right next to us

443
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,500
but we turn to him to ask for his money.

444
00:52:52,208 --> 00:52:53,458
When you feel better,

445
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:55,625
do something for me.

446
00:52:58,166 --> 00:52:59,416
Get out of here...

447
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,083
or many people will die because of you.

448
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:10,458
Then why did you help me?

449
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,000
I've seen many good cops sent here to die.

450
00:53:21,666 --> 00:53:23,041
You might not make it again.

451
00:53:28,083 --> 00:53:29,750
You can only run for so long.

452
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,083
You only have one job.

453
00:54:35,708 --> 00:54:37,958
Nobody new gets in.
Is that too much to ask?

454
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:41,166
Answer me! Can you do that?

455
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:06,583
I, Khun Puntarak Rajjadej,

456
00:55:07,125 --> 00:55:08,541
carry out an official order

457
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:13,875
to suspend Luang Olan
for the murder of the Inspector General

458
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:16,666
and for criminal association.

459
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:20,458
You will be placed under suspension

460
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:23,708
immediately.

461
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:27,583
Do you have any proof
before throwing accusations at me?

462
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:31,458
Never mind.
I'm a law-abiding citizen anyway.

463
00:55:31,750 --> 00:55:32,750
Here's the deal.

464
00:55:34,750 --> 00:55:37,916
Let's make a bet over the next three days

465
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:43,875
whether you find any evidence
or if you become a dead body.

466
00:55:55,583 --> 00:55:59,000
They said that Khun Pun was very powerful.

467
00:55:59,541 --> 00:56:03,000
He knew his way around sorcery
just like Alhawi Yalu.

468
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:07,748
They also said that the criminals
he captured, he cut all their heads off.

469
00:56:07,833 --> 00:56:09,250
Then this Khun Pun,

470
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:12,791
he placed those heads
under each flight of his stairs

471
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:15,500
so he could step on them every day.

472
00:56:15,916 --> 00:56:20,208
Some of the skulls were made
into ashtrays to confine their spirits.

473
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:23,375
-True stories.
-Is he really a cop?

474
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,375
I don't care if he's a real cop.

475
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,125
You can't just let him go.

476
00:56:46,708 --> 00:56:48,541
If you promise to quit being a criminal

477
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,166
and to enter the monkhood,

478
00:56:51,791 --> 00:56:53,458
I promise I'll capture you alive.

479
00:57:11,666 --> 00:57:13,458
Tell every single one of them

480
00:57:14,416 --> 00:57:16,041
to come to me and sign their names,

481
00:57:17,166 --> 00:57:18,500
and I will capture them alive.

482
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:23,541
I think this Khun is out of his mind.

483
00:57:24,750 --> 00:57:28,000
Don't you think?
Who will show up to register?

484
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:49,875
You're still trying to catch
the big fish with a tiny hook, goatherder?

485
00:57:59,958 --> 00:58:02,291
Here's your money.

486
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:15,375
I'd like to make another bet
that I can catch the big fish.

487
00:58:19,083 --> 00:58:20,041
Long ago,

488
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:25,791
there was a boy who thought like you.

489
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,541
The boy lived here with that big fish.

490
00:58:29,708 --> 00:58:33,708
It made him think that it was his.

491
00:58:37,166 --> 00:58:38,125
And then one day,

492
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,291
law enforcement like yourself

493
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:47,416
brought this thing called justice.

494
00:58:55,125 --> 00:58:57,375
The boy learned that the big fish

495
00:58:58,166 --> 00:58:59,708
was no longer his.

496
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:08,916
Remember me.

497
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:12,666
My name is Alhawi Yalu.

498
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,083
Alhawi Yalu.

499
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,625
I understand why you did it.

500
00:59:28,791 --> 00:59:30,041
Kamnan Jun is crooked.

501
00:59:30,791 --> 00:59:33,458
That's why I sent you a message
that all of them were here.

502
00:59:35,500 --> 00:59:37,083
As long as I'm still alive,

503
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:40,333
they have no reason
to send new people here.

504
00:59:43,791 --> 00:59:44,833
We can work together

505
00:59:46,166 --> 00:59:47,666
to make this town a better place.

506
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:56,541
Comfort and well-being
are only for the ruling class.

507
00:59:58,750 --> 01:00:01,208
What are you trying to do, master?

508
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:05,166
Trying to uphold justice, master?

509
01:00:06,458 --> 01:00:08,916
I am the justice!

510
01:00:12,916 --> 01:00:16,291
What you do... is against the law.

511
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:21,541
Between you and I,
the difference is the uniform.

512
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,500
This place can exist without you!

513
01:01:11,416 --> 01:01:13,458
I don't think anyone will show up today.

514
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:17,041
I suggest that we call it a day.

515
01:01:23,500 --> 01:01:24,375
Why?

516
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:28,875
-They want to be outlaws so bad?
-Khun Pun!

517
01:01:29,291 --> 01:01:31,791
-Khun Pun! Bad news!
-What's going on?

518
01:01:34,375 --> 01:01:35,791
We just learned that

519
01:01:36,166 --> 01:01:40,416
Alhawi Yalu knows
that Khaitoh's village saved your life.

520
01:01:41,541 --> 01:01:43,208
They're heading there right now.

521
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:46,416
What should we do, sir?

522
01:01:50,041 --> 01:01:52,083
-Is that true?
-Yes, sir.

523
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:55,041
Hey!

524
01:02:13,875 --> 01:02:15,583
Hurry! Go to the village!

525
01:03:54,541 --> 01:03:57,541
Tell everyone in the village. From now on,

526
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:00,208
they owe me their lives.

527
01:04:16,833 --> 01:04:17,791
Suea Sang,

528
01:04:18,416 --> 01:04:21,625
do you know why I invited you here?

529
01:04:23,375 --> 01:04:24,250
No.

530
01:04:25,916 --> 01:04:27,041
To be honest,

531
01:04:27,875 --> 01:04:29,000
you're more than capable,

532
01:04:29,916 --> 01:04:32,583
perhaps a lot more than Alhawi even.

533
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:34,666
Why be just a follower?

534
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:37,125
Hear me out.

535
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:39,625
From now on,

536
01:04:40,375 --> 01:04:42,458
you take orders from me directly.

537
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:44,833
What do you say?

538
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:48,583
All right.

539
01:04:49,916 --> 01:04:50,791
Sir.

540
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:01,000
Welcome to the civil world.

541
01:05:05,208 --> 01:05:07,708
This is mother turtle's home.

542
01:05:08,916 --> 01:05:10,958
Mother turtle has three eggs.

543
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:13,500
Father turtle's walking out.

544
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,583
I think I'm going to write a song.

545
01:05:17,958 --> 01:05:18,958
What is it about?

546
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:23,375
About little Mali

547
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:27,708
and Malai, my sister. Little Mali flowers
braided into beautiful Malai.

548
01:05:28,833 --> 01:05:30,083
Make it beautiful.

549
01:05:30,541 --> 01:05:33,500
Of course. That's my specialty.

550
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:41,708
Mali!

551
01:05:44,416 --> 01:05:47,583
Mali!

552
01:05:50,291 --> 01:05:53,166
Mali!

553
01:05:55,083 --> 01:05:58,000
Here is mother turtle.

554
01:06:00,541 --> 01:06:02,666
Brother, come play with me?

555
01:06:05,666 --> 01:06:08,458
Mother turtle will lay eggs here.

556
01:07:07,791 --> 01:07:08,750
Damn.

557
01:07:20,500 --> 01:07:21,666
We were too late.

558
01:07:24,208 --> 01:07:25,250
-Bang.
-Yes?

559
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,833
-Phueak, gather the bodies.
-Yes, sir.

560
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,625
Do it now.

561
01:07:42,083 --> 01:07:44,500
Inspector!
This one's still alive.

562
01:07:50,333 --> 01:07:52,041
Suea Sang attacked us.

563
01:07:54,666 --> 01:07:57,583
Khaitoh and some villagers fled
to the jungle.

564
01:07:58,541 --> 01:07:59,416
Tuan!

565
01:08:06,958 --> 01:08:07,916
Khun Pun.

566
01:08:09,125 --> 01:08:10,208
Khun Pun.

567
01:08:27,332 --> 01:08:28,250
In the morning,

568
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,500
the tide is highest.
If we sail along the mountain,

569
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:33,457
we can arrive on the shore
without worrying about the sandbar.

570
01:08:33,917 --> 01:08:34,917
Yes, sir! Admiral, sir!

571
01:08:35,625 --> 01:08:38,082
Send my message to the Army.

572
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:41,000
Tell them to prepare for landings.

573
01:08:41,707 --> 01:08:43,917
Tomorrow our Imperial Japanese Army

574
01:08:44,582 --> 01:08:47,167
will prove our greatness
and conquer this land.

575
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:50,082
-Yes, sir! Admiral, sir!
-Yes, sir! Admiral, sir!

576
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:55,125
-Hello.
-Hello.

577
01:08:56,582 --> 01:08:58,250
What's the progress with our trains?

578
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:01,875
About our trains, what's the progress?

579
01:09:02,707 --> 01:09:05,625
Tell him the trains will arrive tomorrow.

580
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:08,375
Everything is going as planned.

581
01:09:08,792 --> 01:09:11,375
Just don't forget to keep
your end of the bargain.

582
01:09:12,582 --> 01:09:14,832
The trains will arrive here tomorrow.

583
01:09:16,375 --> 01:09:21,042
Everything is in progress
just as you ordered.

584
01:09:21,832 --> 01:09:25,707
You just keep your end of the bargain
like we agreed.

585
01:09:27,582 --> 01:09:29,375
We have plenty of gold. Don't you worry.

586
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:35,417
Well, I have to worry about my 20%.

587
01:09:36,707 --> 01:09:37,582
Your country...

588
01:09:39,292 --> 01:09:41,125
is so cheap for us to buy.

589
01:10:05,957 --> 01:10:09,875
-Sir?
-Glum, Malai, come out now.

590
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:16,207
How's the village?

591
01:10:27,417 --> 01:10:28,707
We have to go through the jungle.

592
01:10:30,082 --> 01:10:32,167
Once we reach the border,

593
01:10:33,625 --> 01:10:34,750
we'll find the main railroad.

594
01:10:35,582 --> 01:10:36,792
There should be passing trains.

595
01:10:37,667 --> 01:10:38,542
By that time,

596
01:10:39,957 --> 01:10:42,917
we should be safe.

597
01:10:43,875 --> 01:10:45,542
Come on now. Let's go.

598
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:47,292
Careful.

599
01:10:48,832 --> 01:10:51,167
-Watch your step. It's slippery.
-Careful.

600
01:10:54,542 --> 01:10:55,417
Wait!

601
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:11,167
You have to hurry.

602
01:11:12,082 --> 01:11:13,375
Suea Sang is coming.

603
01:11:16,625 --> 01:11:17,500
Go!

604
01:11:23,167 --> 01:11:25,500
Bu-nga, come with us.

605
01:11:27,125 --> 01:11:28,957
This is all I can do for you, Malai.

606
01:11:31,375 --> 01:11:32,250
Take care.

607
01:11:38,957 --> 01:11:41,500
Malai! Malai! Come on!

608
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:53,000
Hurry!

609
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,417
Come on now!

610
01:12:30,957 --> 01:12:32,332
Let's go!

611
01:12:36,457 --> 01:12:39,582
Hurry!

612
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:49,125
Come on! Come on!

613
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:59,667
Promise me that Mali didn't die in vain.

614
01:14:02,417 --> 01:14:03,375
I promise.

615
01:14:08,417 --> 01:14:10,125
-Inspector.
-Yes, sir.

616
01:14:10,957 --> 01:14:13,707
When the trains arrive in Ampoe,
everyone should be safe.

617
01:14:15,292 --> 01:14:16,625
I will go back to town.

618
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:19,250
Take care of them.

619
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:22,667
Sir,

620
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:28,667
how can you be an inspector
without subordinates?

621
01:14:29,957 --> 01:14:32,832
-I'm going with you.
-Me too.

622
01:14:34,207 --> 01:14:35,125
Me too.

623
01:14:48,750 --> 01:14:49,957
It's Suea Sang, sir.

624
01:14:51,457 --> 01:14:53,707
Kill them all!

625
01:15:09,457 --> 01:15:11,792
Sir, can you please tell me the marks?

626
01:15:11,957 --> 01:15:12,917
Two o'clock.

627
01:15:16,207 --> 01:15:17,625
Four o'clock.

628
01:15:54,792 --> 01:15:58,042
Get out of the way! Go!

629
01:16:05,250 --> 01:16:07,000
Hurry!

630
01:16:12,417 --> 01:16:13,750
We surrender!

631
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,957
-Don't shoot.
-Get down!

632
01:16:34,250 --> 01:16:35,125
Put the guns down.

633
01:18:54,582 --> 01:18:55,875
Khun Pun!

634
01:18:57,667 --> 01:19:01,917
-Khun Pun!
-But! But!

635
01:19:08,957 --> 01:19:10,082
No!

636
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:18,917
No!

637
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:44,167
Serve me as your master.

638
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:43,125
Get down!

639
01:24:58,792 --> 01:24:59,707
Hey!

640
01:25:01,082 --> 01:25:02,042
What happened?

641
01:25:03,082 --> 01:25:03,957
Who did this?

642
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:08,457
Suea Sang.

643
01:25:09,375 --> 01:25:11,082
He took his people to kill the villagers.

644
01:25:16,167 --> 01:25:18,207
How could he? It wasn't my order!

645
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:41,957
The soldiers on the train
were all Japanese.

646
01:25:45,875 --> 01:25:46,832
Khun Pun.

647
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:12,292
I can only come with you this far.

648
01:26:24,332 --> 01:26:25,457
I'm going with you.

649
01:26:28,582 --> 01:26:31,667
Master, you made me a promise.

650
01:26:33,832 --> 01:26:34,707
Alhawi.

651
01:26:39,542 --> 01:26:40,707
You betrayed me.

652
01:26:46,042 --> 01:26:46,957
Alhawi.

653
01:26:48,207 --> 01:26:49,167
Where are you?

654
01:26:51,125 --> 01:26:52,000
You...

655
01:26:53,542 --> 01:26:55,582
didn't do it for everyone
like you promised.

656
01:26:57,250 --> 01:26:58,207
Alhawi.

657
01:26:58,917 --> 01:27:00,457
It's just a little misunderstanding.

658
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:05,542
Suea Sang turned against me
because of you!

659
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:10,750
Because you failed to kill Khun Pun,

660
01:27:11,417 --> 01:27:12,917
you left me with no choice!

661
01:27:13,707 --> 01:27:14,625
Alhawi,

662
01:27:15,332 --> 01:27:19,375
sometimes we have to make sacrifices
for the greater good.

663
01:27:20,667 --> 01:27:25,250
Luang! You are a bloodsucker!

664
01:27:31,875 --> 01:27:35,957
-Go!
-Get out of here.

665
01:27:40,832 --> 01:27:41,875
Come this way.

666
01:27:42,667 --> 01:27:43,542
Come on!

667
01:27:49,375 --> 01:27:50,542
Go! Go!

668
01:27:54,417 --> 01:27:55,332
Go!

669
01:28:06,500 --> 01:28:07,957
What's going on here?

670
01:28:08,582 --> 01:28:10,582
You snake!

671
01:28:10,917 --> 01:28:13,792
Are you on our side or what?

672
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:15,500
Listen, I can explain.

673
01:28:50,582 --> 01:28:51,707
I'm out of ammo.

674
01:28:53,625 --> 01:28:54,625
Fall back!

675
01:29:29,707 --> 01:29:31,125
Come on! Run!

676
01:29:31,417 --> 01:29:32,457
Hurry!

677
01:29:34,707 --> 01:29:35,582
Come here!

678
01:29:50,582 --> 01:29:51,500
Inspector!

679
01:29:53,292 --> 01:29:55,542
Inspector!

680
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:14,875
Get down!

681
01:31:17,917 --> 01:31:18,792
Malai...

682
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:29,917
No!

683
01:31:36,542 --> 01:31:37,875
Malai!

684
01:31:59,167 --> 01:32:02,332
-Phueak, cover me!
-Yes, sir!

685
01:33:55,417 --> 01:33:57,207
If you promise to quit being a criminal,

686
01:34:00,582 --> 01:34:01,792
I'll take you alive.

687
01:34:09,625 --> 01:34:10,667
What about you?

688
01:34:12,292 --> 01:34:14,582
Do you still want to catch that big fish?

689
01:34:52,250 --> 01:34:53,332
Both of us...

690
01:34:54,542 --> 01:34:56,082
are wasting time fighting each other.

691
01:34:58,042 --> 01:34:59,707
Give yourself up, Alhawi.

692
01:35:00,375 --> 01:35:04,292
Luang Olan manipulated and used you.
I'll be your witness in court.

693
01:35:06,250 --> 01:35:07,292
Two hundred people.

694
01:35:08,917 --> 01:35:11,875
I have killed two hundred people.

695
01:35:15,125 --> 01:35:16,832
Most of them were cops.

696
01:35:19,250 --> 01:35:20,125
And you?

697
01:35:21,375 --> 01:35:22,582
How many have you killed?

698
01:35:24,582 --> 01:35:25,917
Bet it's no less than mine.

699
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:27,375
Right?

700
01:35:31,417 --> 01:35:33,000
We have both been used.

701
01:35:34,917 --> 01:35:37,000
We are both going to hell.

702
01:35:40,082 --> 01:35:41,500
You should just be yourself.

703
01:35:42,707 --> 01:35:43,792
Admit it,

704
01:35:45,207 --> 01:35:47,457
you're dying to cut off my head.

705
01:35:50,375 --> 01:35:52,000
Come and take your future...

706
01:35:53,792 --> 01:35:54,917
in exchange for your heart...

707
01:35:56,832 --> 01:35:58,582
that I'll gouge out with my bare hands.

708
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:07,167
Right.

709
01:36:08,792 --> 01:36:10,167
Perhaps you and I,

710
01:36:11,292 --> 01:36:13,000
we're not so different after all,

711
01:36:13,375 --> 01:36:14,292
Alhawi.

712
01:36:58,167 --> 01:36:59,500
Raya Gaji,

713
01:37:01,167 --> 01:37:03,375
another name of Alhawi?

714
01:37:04,417 --> 01:37:06,792
He's a legendary fighter...

715
01:37:08,417 --> 01:37:10,042
who never lost his faith.

716
01:37:12,292 --> 01:37:16,000
Young man, I can see
the spirit of Raya Gaji within you.

717
01:37:17,000 --> 01:37:19,832
Please bring my son back
from the endless abyss.

718
01:38:07,582 --> 01:38:09,167
Alhawi's weakness...

719
01:38:10,707 --> 01:38:11,750
is his heart.

720
01:38:16,957 --> 01:38:17,875
Raya Gaji.

721
01:38:26,500 --> 01:38:28,417
Raya Gaji, my son.

722
01:41:08,957 --> 01:41:13,792
Vinyan SampannoItipiso Bhagava
Namo Budhaya. I set you free.

723
01:41:13,957 --> 01:41:15,873
I set you free.

724
01:41:15,957 --> 01:41:20,292
I set you free. I set you free.

725
01:42:38,042 --> 01:42:39,000
Long live the Emperor!

726
01:42:39,332 --> 01:42:40,625
Long live the Emperor!

727
01:42:43,917 --> 01:42:45,167
Long live the Emperor!

728
01:42:48,332 --> 01:42:49,667
Long live the Emperor!

729
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,957
Long live the Emperor!
Long live the Emperor!

730
01:42:59,292 --> 01:43:01,375
Kimi

731
01:43:01,707 --> 01:43:04,042
Ga yo wa

732
01:43:04,457 --> 01:43:09,875
Chiyo ni
Yachiyo ni

733
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:12,957
Sazare ishi no...

734
01:43:14,082 --> 01:43:17,582
I still remember what Luang Adul said
before I took this mission.

735
01:43:18,707 --> 01:43:19,792
He asked me...

736
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:24,792
if I thought I could make a change.

737
01:43:27,417 --> 01:43:29,250
I don't have an answer for him.

738
01:43:31,082 --> 01:43:35,750
All I know is
if we don't have faith in our country...

739
01:43:35,957 --> 01:43:38,748
-Long live the Emperor!
-...we have nothing left...

740
01:43:38,832 --> 01:43:39,957
Long live the Emperor!

741
01:43:40,750 --> 01:43:42,707
...and we should have
enough courage

742
01:43:42,875 --> 01:43:45,250
-to protect it.
-Banzai! Banzai!

743
01:45:39,042 --> 01:45:42,207
If you promise to quit being a criminal
and to enter the monkhood,

744
01:45:44,332 --> 01:45:46,917
I'll capture you alive, Suea Bai.

745
01:49:24,875 --> 01:49:26,875
