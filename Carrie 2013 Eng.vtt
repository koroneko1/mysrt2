I am so excited for her.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.847
I remember my prom.
(CHUCKLES)

32:14.920 --> 32:17.810
Anyway,
she's going to love it.

32:20.040 --> 32:22.361
These are Godless times,
Mrs. Snell.

32:28.040 --> 32:29.371
<i>JOHN: This gym teacher
was running Chrissie</i>

32:29.440 --> 32:30.965
into the ground
and used profanity.

32:31.040 --> 32:32.849
I believe the term
"shitty" was used.

32:32.920 --> 32:34.524
JOHN: She can't do that.
It's abuse of power.

32:34.640 --> 32:37.405
You're right, Daddy.
That's what she said.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.881
"Shitty."
She's really abusive.

32:39.960 --> 32:43.487
Ms. Desjardin was reprimanded for
what happened in class today.

32:43.560 --> 32:45.642
But you know we've had
a lot of problems

32:45.720 --> 32:46.801
with your daughter
in the past.

32:46.880 --> 32:50.407
And now, with what she did to
her classmate, Carrie White.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.642
The girl was having her...

32:52.720 --> 32:54.210
What your daughter
and her posse...

32:54.280 --> 32:56.681
I'm not going to sit here
and listen to half-truths.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.842
I know my daughter. She
said she didn't do it.

32:58.920 --> 33:00.888
I want her prom
privileges restored.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.681
You can't prove she did
anything, can you?

33:04.480 --> 33:07.450
I believe that there is a
video of the incident.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.687
DESJARDIN: And I think your
daughter is the one who took it.

33:11.760 --> 33:13.808
I think a video like
that would probably

33:13.880 --> 33:15.325
be pretty damning
to anyone in it

33:15.400 --> 33:17.084
and to the person
who made it.

33:17.160 --> 33:18.924
Don't you,
Mr. Hargensen?

33:19.000 --> 33:21.321
I don't know.
I'm just a gym teacher,

33:21.400 --> 33:23.323
but it seems like
a video like that

33:23.400 --> 33:25.368
would probably affect
college admissions,

33:25.480 --> 33:29.769
possibly a lawsuit,
tons of bad publicity.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.446
I wonder what <i>The Today Show</i>
would do with a video like that.

33:32.520 --> 33:35.524
I think we should just look at
her phone and if it's not there,

33:35.600 --> 33:39.400
I owe you a huge apology and she
should be allowed to go to prom.

33:40.760 --> 33:41.761

33:45.880 --> 33:47.325

33:48.280 --> 33:50.123

going to give them my phone.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.690

things on here.

33:51.800 --> 33:53.928

of privacy or something?

33:55.120 --> 33:57.043

to go to prom,

33:57.120 --> 33:59.726
just give them the damn phone
and we can be done with this.

33:59.800 --> 34:00.881
I have to get
back to work.

34:00.960 --> 34:02.041
Dad.

34:02.120 --> 34:04.930
God damn it, just give
them your phone, Chris.

34:35.880 --> 34:37.848
We could have had
them by the balls.

34:38.360 --> 34:41.409
We deserved it for what
we did to Carrie White.

I deserved it.

shitty thing for no reason.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.648
Bullshit!

34:49.719 --> 34:52.724

everyone but her and her mother

34:52.800 --> 34:55.201
are going to hell and you
stuck up for her? Come on!

34:55.320 --> 34:57.641
You can be such
a pig sometimes, Chris.

34:57.720 --> 34:59.051
What did Carrie White
ever do to you?

34:59.120 --> 35:01.805
She's been begging for it
since the sixth grade, Sue.

35:01.880 --> 35:03.370
I got to go.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.087

you were in there

Oh, you stopped?

35:17.000 --> 35:18.889

Why did you keep running?

Hmm?

35:20.480 --> 35:22.289
Why did you keep running, Sue?
Stop it, Chris!

You kept running,

<i>I guess for now
this is how it'll be</i>

01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.006
<i>I don't think I can make it
Oh, you're the one</i>

like a loaded gun</i>

01:38:50.880 --> 01:38:55.408
<i>I don't think I can make it
Oh, you're the one</i>

<i>Staring into the tears
like a loaded gun</i>

01:39:04.305 --> 01:39:10.373
