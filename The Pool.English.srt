1
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:11,791
Go!

2
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:56,958
6 DAYS EARLIER…

3
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,666
Why are the pool lights on?

4
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,333
Those are automatic lights.

5
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:44,958
Art team!

6
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:46,791
Art team!

7
00:03:47,666 --> 00:03:48,625
Yes.

8
00:03:48,708 --> 00:03:50,083
You're an art guy?

9
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,291
Yes.

10
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:52,583
We've met before…

11
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:57,625
Good. Go check the underwater light
that keeps going on and off.

12
00:03:57,708 --> 00:03:59,833
Fix it quickly.
You have to finish tonight.

13
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,958
-They will close the pool tomorrow.
-All right.

14
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:18,416
Day, here's Lucky.

15
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,333
Babe.

16
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,666
I'd like to dive, can I?

17
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,166
Naughty girl.

18
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,083
Just once, please.

19
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:29,958
Please, please, please?

20
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:31,625
No, you can't.

21
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,458
Here you are.

22
00:04:56,833 --> 00:04:58,041
Are you tired?

23
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:00,583
I'm sorry, I haven't taken you anywhere.

24
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,500
It's all right, I understand.

25
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,208
Bad boy.

26
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,041
Worried that we'll get caught?

27
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,416
Lucky is here.

28
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,375
I have something for you.

29
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,791
Waste of money.

30
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,458
It's cute, you're grumpy.

31
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,375
Here.

32
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:03,958
Isn't it cute?

33
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:07,625
You don't like it?

34
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,166
Have you named the baby?

35
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,000
Come on,

36
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,625
don't say that.

37
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:18,666
Just kidding.

38
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,875
I'm just kidding.

39
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,416
I'm not pregnant. Don't be so serious.

40
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,125
Lucky.

41
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:33,541
Lucky, come out.

42
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,875
-Mayom.
-Mayom.

43
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:47,208
Hey, if you stayed silent,
you'd have had a free show.

44
00:06:47,291 --> 00:06:48,333
You just missed it.

45
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:53,500
Hey, Day.
The director is looking for your dog.

46
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:55,375
Go to the set.

47
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:58,458
I'm coming.

48
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,500
You work on set

49
00:07:00,583 --> 00:07:02,833
and bring your dog in for extra money.

50
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,291
Saving up for a wedding?

51
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,291
Day? Keep it up.

52
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,166
-Bro.
-Yes.

53
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,916
When he gives the word,
have the dog jump over

54
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,791
and cross the camera frame.

55
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,333
-Do you hear, Lucky?
-Okay?

56
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:25,541
Make me proud.

57
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:26,541
Need a rehearsal?

58
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,208
No, I trained him myself.

59
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,875
Come on. Get ready.

60
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:32,166
Sound, ready?

61
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,416
Yes.

62
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,208
Let him finish playing with his dog.

63
00:08:01,291 --> 00:08:02,458
Then we'll start shooting

64
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,291
He's ready.

65
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,416
This is the last cut.

66
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,333
One, two, three!

67
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:26,750
It's a wrap!

68
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,250
Lucky! Lucky, come here.

69
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,583
Come here. Come.

70
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,208
Come on, quick.

71
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:25,125
Come on, Lucky.

72
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:26,916
Fetch the ball.

73
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:48,291
FLOODING CRISIS. OFFICERS IN SEARCH
OF ESCAPED CROCODILE

74
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:33,250
Damn it, Day! You leave stuff everywhere.

75
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,375
So comfortable, huh?

76
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:46,708
Get out.

77
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,250
I've just released the water, come.

78
00:10:56,125 --> 00:10:58,125
Hey, why did you chain him?

79
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,083
You're lucky I haven't chained you.

80
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:04,208
He could have run around
and fallen into the water.

81
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,416
Day, your insulin shot.

82
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,000
Better keep them in a safe place.

83
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:27,958
KOY

84
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,083
You aren't coming back, are you?

85
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:37,375
Of course not.

86
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,583
See you in three months.

87
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:41,166
Clean up everything for me

88
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,500
and leave anything you don't need here.

89
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:45,958
This pool is no longer used.

90
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,166
Bribe me 300 for leaving work early.

91
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,166
I'm gonna miss my flight.

92
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,750
Order pizza for me then.

93
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,958
Come on.

94
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,041
Want pizza?

95
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,500
-Pizza!
-Hey.

96
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,625
I gotta go.

97
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:03,166
Nepal is waiting.

98
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,041
Good luck, man.

99
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,833
CAUTION - POOL DEPTH 6 METERS

100
00:13:20,541 --> 00:13:21,666
Ridiculous.

101
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,833
Calm down, Lucky. It's gonna be all right.

102
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:15,416
It's gonna be all right.

103
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:26,583
It's going to be all right.

104
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,333
Help!

105
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,541
Help!

106
00:16:10,916 --> 00:16:12,166
KOY

107
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,125
Get up, Lucky. Up!

108
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,458
Pizza delivery!

109
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,541
Hello. Hi.

110
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:05,541
What's up?

111
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:08,000
I don't see anyone here.

112
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,208
There's only a dog.

113
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:29,000
I just called out. Nobody is here.

114
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:36,708
Yes.

115
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,416
Help.

116
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,875
Help!

117
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,875
Can anyone hear me? Help!

118
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:03,500
Help!

119
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,416
Help!

120
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,916
Don't jump, Koy!

121
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,125
Help!

122
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,666
Help!

123
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:43,916
Help, anybody! Help!

124
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,375
Can you hear me, Koy?

125
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:50,125
Things can't get any worse.

126
00:24:23,375 --> 00:24:25,458
Go on, keep barking.

127
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:29,208
Make yourself useful.

128
00:24:36,458 --> 00:24:38,250
Lucky. Shut up.

129
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,208
Lucky, quiet.

130
00:24:47,083 --> 00:24:48,750
No!

131
00:24:48,833 --> 00:24:50,666
Lucky! Let it go, Lucky.

132
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:53,125
Don't bark at it. Let it go.

133
00:24:53,208 --> 00:24:54,791
No. No. Lucky.

134
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:37,625
Lucky, you stupid dog!

135
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:39,125
Do you know what you've just done?

136
00:26:37,125 --> 00:26:38,416
Don't be afraid, Koy.

137
00:26:40,458 --> 00:26:41,625
It's going to be all right.

138
00:26:43,833 --> 00:26:45,208
Someone will come to help us.

139
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,708
Lucky, shut up.

140
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:11,125
Shut up.

141
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,375
Koy, be patient.

142
00:32:23,208 --> 00:32:24,416
Bastard!

143
00:32:52,791 --> 00:32:54,125
Help!

144
00:32:54,208 --> 00:32:56,750
Can anyone hear me?

145
00:32:56,833 --> 00:32:58,583
Help me!

146
00:33:01,625 --> 00:33:03,541
Help!

147
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:14,791
You are burning.

148
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,291
Help!

149
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,875
Help!

150
00:35:54,083 --> 00:35:55,708
Help, please!

151
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,500
Help!

152
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,416
Does anyone hear me?

153
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,625
Help!

154
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:45,625
Day.

155
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,250
Koy.

156
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,166
I'm here.

157
00:37:06,875 --> 00:37:07,875
Are you all right?

158
00:37:15,375 --> 00:37:16,583
What happened?

159
00:37:23,916 --> 00:37:25,291
We are stuck in a swimming pool.

160
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,833
And what is that?

161
00:37:38,416 --> 00:37:40,125
I thought he'd take the baby out of you.

162
00:37:40,208 --> 00:37:41,291
Who…

163
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:43,875
Who'd take the baby out?

164
00:37:50,541 --> 00:37:51,375
Damn.

165
00:37:51,458 --> 00:37:53,416
How come she picked someone like you?

166
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,875
I'm handsome.

167
00:37:54,958 --> 00:37:57,458
You are insulting her.

168
00:37:57,541 --> 00:37:59,041
I'm serious.

169
00:37:59,125 --> 00:38:01,625
What do I have against
those rich guys who were after her?

170
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,291
Seriously,

171
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:06,791
I heard that she is pregnant.

172
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:10,375
I'd tell her to have an abortion.

173
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:13,125
How will she feel if she hears that?

174
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,666
I can't support her.

175
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,625
The baby will grow up struggling.

176
00:38:17,708 --> 00:38:19,416
I haven't slept for how many nights now?

177
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,125
How can I be a father?

178
00:38:21,208 --> 00:38:22,833
Aren't you a bit selfish?

179
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:24,916
She is not pregnant.

180
00:38:25,916 --> 00:38:27,000
What if she is?

181
00:38:27,958 --> 00:38:29,375
Abortion is illegal.

182
00:38:30,458 --> 00:38:31,333
Don't do it.

183
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:32,875
It's also a sin.

184
00:38:40,958 --> 00:38:41,833
Baby…

185
00:38:44,666 --> 00:38:45,583
Day.

186
00:38:48,791 --> 00:38:50,041
You knew that?

187
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:16,166
Don't give up.

188
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,125
Day, you can help me and the baby.

189
00:40:22,791 --> 00:40:23,708
I know it.

190
00:40:31,208 --> 00:40:32,208
How are you doing?

191
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:37,166
Hungry.

192
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,625
Poor Lucky.

193
00:40:44,666 --> 00:40:45,958
He is hungry like us.

194
00:40:58,583 --> 00:40:59,583
Lucky.

195
00:41:02,166 --> 00:41:03,458
Lucky.

196
00:41:03,541 --> 00:41:05,958
Open your mouth. Open it.

197
00:41:06,041 --> 00:41:08,333
Open your mouth. Lucky.

198
00:41:08,416 --> 00:41:09,583
Come on.

199
00:41:09,666 --> 00:41:11,541
Open it. Share with us.

200
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:16,750
You…

201
00:41:17,666 --> 00:41:19,166
Son of a bitch!

202
00:41:20,083 --> 00:41:22,125
You are ungrateful.

203
00:41:23,708 --> 00:41:26,958
When we make it up there,
you're staying outside the house!

204
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:29,000
Don't dream of sleeping on our bed.

205
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,875
Eat up.

206
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:45,208
It's still fresh.

207
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:51,458
And you?

208
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:54,125
I'm not hungry.

209
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:58,791
It'll go off anyway.

210
00:42:00,583 --> 00:42:02,750
The baby would want his father to eat.

211
00:42:16,583 --> 00:42:17,583
I love you, Koy.

212
00:42:17,666 --> 00:42:18,708
Liar.

213
00:42:18,791 --> 00:42:21,458
You can't even take me to eat pizza.

214
00:42:22,583 --> 00:42:23,958
I have to work.

215
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,041
Always about work.

216
00:42:28,375 --> 00:42:29,708
Beg me, please.

217
00:42:39,791 --> 00:42:41,083
Why are you crying?

218
00:42:49,125 --> 00:42:51,291
I'm having my pizza now, Day.

219
00:42:54,041 --> 00:42:55,500
Do you want to order more?

220
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:23,375
HELP

221
00:44:49,458 --> 00:44:50,791
Day.

222
00:44:53,541 --> 00:44:54,750
Day.

223
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,166
I'm tired because of the heat.

224
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:37,500
Hey,

225
00:45:39,125 --> 00:45:40,583
did he do anything to you?

226
00:45:45,875 --> 00:45:47,125
It's not a "he."

227
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:53,583
Is it a female crocodile?

228
00:47:49,291 --> 00:47:50,500
Come on. Come on.

229
00:48:19,791 --> 00:48:21,666
Have you done this before?

230
00:48:22,875 --> 00:48:23,791
At home,

231
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:26,083
I didn't have a match.

232
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:27,458
No lighter.

233
00:48:27,541 --> 00:48:28,583
No stove.

234
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,500
I lived in a cave.

235
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,125
This was how I started a fire.

236
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:34,583
Funny.

237
00:48:35,500 --> 00:48:36,916
So not true.

238
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,166
I saw it in Castaway.

239
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:52,375
Take it easy.

240
00:48:55,208 --> 00:48:56,375
You have to eat.

241
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:03,375
Let's share.

242
00:49:19,458 --> 00:49:21,416
We can't stay here any longer.

243
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:24,500
We have to find a way out.

244
00:49:35,708 --> 00:49:37,250
Day, a little higher.

245
00:49:56,958 --> 00:49:59,166
Day. I can't do it!

246
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,750
Okay, Koy. It's all right.

247
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:09,375
Get down.

248
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,125
We can never get out this way.

249
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:18,666
We have to let the crocodile up.

250
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,083
And you go into the tunnel.

251
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:26,958
There will be a place you can hide.

252
00:50:28,041 --> 00:50:29,166
If I'm not around…

253
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,541
she will come after you for sure.

254
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:40,291
Don't be stubborn.

255
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:48,291
The doll is gone.

256
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:51,916
Might have fallen off up there.

257
00:50:58,041 --> 00:50:58,875
Hey.

258
00:51:01,041 --> 00:51:02,875
You didn't take it out, did you?

259
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,250
You've never wanted me
to have an abortion, have you?

260
00:51:47,625 --> 00:51:48,708
I'm sorry.

261
00:52:13,416 --> 00:52:14,791
Come on.

262
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:19,416
Why?

263
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,208
Why, Day?

264
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:28,416
Why?

265
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:33,541
Why are you so cruel?

266
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:40,125
Think about it.

267
00:52:42,708 --> 00:52:44,083
If the baby is born,

268
00:52:45,541 --> 00:52:47,041
and I'm still like this,

269
00:52:49,125 --> 00:52:51,083
how disappointed would the baby be

270
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:54,291
that his father is struggling so bad?

271
00:52:57,041 --> 00:53:00,125
No, Day. That's not true.

272
00:53:01,666 --> 00:53:04,250
Look around you, Day.

273
00:53:05,750 --> 00:53:09,625
How could you be worse than this?

274
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:17,333
Listen to me.

275
00:53:19,083 --> 00:53:22,208
If you want to do something
the baby will be proud of,

276
00:53:23,291 --> 00:53:25,583
you have to do it now.

277
00:53:27,333 --> 00:53:29,750
Make it up there.

278
00:53:29,833 --> 00:53:32,000
You have to make it!

279
00:53:58,791 --> 00:53:59,916
The music box?

280
00:54:02,625 --> 00:54:04,833
You go ahead.
I'll be right behind you. Hurry up.

281
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:16,875
Are you all right?

282
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:32,041
How many days
haven't you had insulin shots?

283
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,500
I've lost count.

284
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:38,958
You have to be all right.

285
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:43,541
I…

286
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,333
I remember…

287
00:55:48,041 --> 00:55:49,416
There is one shot up there.

288
00:57:33,541 --> 00:57:34,666
Baby.

289
00:57:38,666 --> 00:57:39,958
Baby.

290
00:57:48,875 --> 00:57:50,000
Our baby…

291
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:54,458
Baby.

292
00:57:57,666 --> 00:58:00,250
Baby…

293
00:58:07,958 --> 00:58:08,791
Baby.

294
00:58:11,541 --> 00:58:12,625
-Day.
-Baby.

295
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,125
Damn it, Day!

296
00:58:17,208 --> 00:58:19,500
You leave stuff everywhere!

297
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,625
I'm okay, Koy.

298
00:58:28,875 --> 00:58:29,916
I'm okay.

299
00:58:31,291 --> 00:58:34,166
I'm okay.

300
00:58:38,166 --> 00:58:41,291
I am okay.

301
00:58:48,333 --> 00:58:49,875
An addict, you are.

302
00:59:37,541 --> 00:59:39,125
Help!

303
00:59:41,083 --> 00:59:43,708
Help! We are stuck in here!

304
00:59:58,166 --> 01:00:00,666
Koy. Wait for me here.

305
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:02,041
There must be some way.

306
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,000
Come here.

307
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:14,041
Cover the hole with this barrel.

308
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:15,916
So nothing can come through.

309
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,458
It's safer in here.

310
01:00:34,458 --> 01:00:35,625
Help!

311
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:42,750
Just a kid's toy?

312
01:00:49,750 --> 01:00:51,250
Help!

313
01:00:53,541 --> 01:00:54,875
Help!

314
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,291
Does anyone hear me?

315
01:00:57,375 --> 01:00:58,416
Help!

316
01:01:06,291 --> 01:01:08,166
Anybody, help!

317
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:10,375
Does anyone hear me?

318
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,708
Help!

319
01:04:41,083 --> 01:04:42,208
Go!

320
01:04:42,291 --> 01:04:43,125
Go!

321
01:06:40,416 --> 01:06:41,583
Koy, stay with me.

322
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:43,875
I will

323
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,375
go to the other end of the tunnel.

324
01:06:49,083 --> 01:06:50,875
Let's see where it leads me to.

325
01:06:53,458 --> 01:06:55,125
Wait for me here, Koy.

326
01:09:13,333 --> 01:09:18,791
No!

327
01:09:28,916 --> 01:09:31,250
No!

328
01:10:44,541 --> 01:10:46,333
I told you.

329
01:10:46,416 --> 01:10:47,833
Enough, just go home.

330
01:10:47,916 --> 01:10:48,875
It's raining.

331
01:10:49,500 --> 01:10:50,541
Look.

332
01:10:50,625 --> 01:10:53,291
Come on, it should be
somewhere around here.

333
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,541
Will my motorbike get stolen?

334
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,625
Hey.

335
01:10:59,375 --> 01:11:01,000
What's that? Looks creepy.

336
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,666
There it is, our glider.

337
01:11:04,333 --> 01:11:05,625
You go get it.

338
01:11:05,708 --> 01:11:08,041
Hey. Let's go together.

339
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:09,916
How?

340
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:13,291
Should we jump?

341
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:16,791
Look.

342
01:11:33,583 --> 01:11:34,625
So deep.

343
01:11:34,708 --> 01:11:36,500
You can't wait now? Genius.

344
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:37,416
Come on.

345
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,583
Pick it up.

346
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:49,416
Did someone die here?

347
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:50,458
What the hell?

348
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:52,000
Let's go. It's gonna rain.

349
01:11:52,625 --> 01:11:53,875
Who did that?

350
01:11:53,958 --> 01:11:56,916
Could have been a commercial production.

351
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,166
It's none of our business. Let's go.
Stop wasting time.

352
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:01,833
Come on.

353
01:12:02,750 --> 01:12:04,291
They must have left it.

354
01:12:04,375 --> 01:12:05,833
It's soaking wet.

355
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:08,250
What's your problem?

356
01:12:08,333 --> 01:12:09,500
Come on.

357
01:12:15,791 --> 01:12:17,041
-Ready?
-Wait.

358
01:12:19,083 --> 01:12:19,958
Ready?

359
01:12:20,041 --> 01:12:20,875
Yeah.

360
01:12:25,708 --> 01:12:26,708
Where is the step?

361
01:12:28,416 --> 01:12:30,166
Hold it tight. Let me go up.

362
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:33,125
Hey, moron! I might fall off.

363
01:12:33,208 --> 01:12:35,041
I'm going up now.

364
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:41,791
-Ready?
-Wait.

365
01:12:49,708 --> 01:12:50,791
Help…

366
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Help.

367
01:12:56,916 --> 01:13:00,291
Help… Help us…

368
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:02,583
Help.

369
01:13:05,583 --> 01:13:06,541
Help…

370
01:17:48,041 --> 01:17:50,000
No. Lucky! No!

371
01:23:36,208 --> 01:23:39,208
Wake up, Koy!

372
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:46,666
Koy, can you hear me?

373
01:23:47,250 --> 01:23:49,333
Wake up, Koy. Wake up.

374
01:23:53,125 --> 01:23:54,500
I've come back to you.

375
01:23:54,583 --> 01:23:55,875
You hear me, Koy?

376
01:23:58,333 --> 01:23:59,708
Wake up, Koy!

377
01:23:59,791 --> 01:24:00,958
Wake up!

378
01:24:01,041 --> 01:24:03,333
Wake up! Can you hear me?

379
01:24:03,416 --> 01:24:05,166
Koy! Wake up!

380
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:11,958
Wake up…

381
01:24:13,500 --> 01:24:15,666
Wake up. Koy…

382
01:24:31,250 --> 01:24:34,541
Wake up, Koy!

383
01:24:46,333 --> 01:24:48,666
Koy! Wake--

384
01:25:06,166 --> 01:25:07,541
Come here.
