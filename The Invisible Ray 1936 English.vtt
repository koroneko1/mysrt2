WEBVTT

02:12.125 --> 02:13.706
Diana?

02:13.708 --> 02:15.414
Yes, mother rukh.

02:15.417 --> 02:17.999
Janos is still in the
laboratory, of course?

02:18.000 --> 02:19.240
Yes, he's checking his equipment

02:19.250 --> 02:21.115
before the people from england arrive.

02:21.125 --> 02:23.332
I'm to let him know when I
see the lights of the car.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.366
It was on such a night that janos

02:40.375 --> 02:42.161
first caught his ray from Andromeda.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.662
Your father worked the guides.

02:45.667 --> 02:50.616
I held the detecting
lens, and never saw again.

02:52.375 --> 02:53.375
= dear mother rukh.

02:54.708 --> 02:57.040
My son will not learn
until too late, I fear,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.832
that the universe is very large,

03:00.833 --> 03:04.530
and there are some secrets
we are not meant to probe.

03:04.542 --> 03:07.249
Janos says the electricity
will help the demonstration.

03:07.250 --> 03:09.616
He is wrong to
demonstrate to these people.

03:09.625 --> 03:10.614
Who are they?

03:10.625 --> 03:13.492
Pygmies that scoff at a giant,

03:13.500 --> 03:15.786
who have said that he is only a visionary,

03:15.792 --> 03:18.374
unscientific, a charlatan, huh.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.789
He's greater than all of them.

03:22.042 --> 03:24.328
He sent for them.

03:24.333 --> 03:28.906
If he had waited, one day
they would have begged,

03:28.917 --> 03:30.282
begged to come to him.

03:55.542 --> 03:56.782
T see the car now.

03:56.792 --> 03:57.952
I'll tell janos.

04:49.333 --> 04:50.333
Janos?

04:51.958 --> 04:52.958
Janos?

05:07.500 --> 05:08.364
= Diana.

05:08.375 --> 05:10.832
They're coming up the grade.

05:11.750 --> 05:15.572
= sir Francis Stevens
and the great Dr. benet

05:15.583 --> 05:18.245
from the university of Paris.

05:18.250 --> 05:19.080
What do they know?

05:19.083 --> 05:21.495
What will they ever know?

05:21.500 --> 05:23.991
I'll take them somewhere
they've never been.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Back into time.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.706
It will work well tonight.

05:27.708 --> 05:29.448
I'm sure and I'm ready.

05:30.667 --> 05:33.739
They'll never laugh at me again.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.750
= janos.

05:36.125 --> 05:37.581
They'll be here any minute.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.198
You must prepare to meet them.

05:41.042 --> 05:42.042
Come.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.125
Yes, yes.

06:03.500 --> 06:04.706
= I'm Diana rukh.

06:04.708 --> 06:06.198
My husband will be here presently.

06:06.208 --> 06:07.539
I'm lady Stevens.

06:07.542 --> 06:09.783
This is my husband, sir Francis.

06:09.792 --> 06:11.032
How do you do?

06:11.042 --> 06:12.248
= and this is Dr. benet.

06:13.292 --> 06:14.122
Madame.

06:14.125 --> 06:14.955
How do you do?

06:14.958 --> 06:16.994
And this is my nephew, Ronald Drake.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.115
How do you do?

06:20.583 --> 06:23.746
May I present you to my
husband's mother, frau rukh.

06:23.750 --> 06:24.785
How do you do?

06:27.000 --> 06:28.536
Oh, what a lovely fire.

06:32.333 --> 06:34.574
I hope you didn't have
too bad a time coming up.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.323
It really is rather a terrible trip.

06:36.333 --> 06:37.789
Oh, I don't mind anything,

06:37.792 --> 06:40.158
but my poor sit-downish husband minded it.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.327
- Brandy?
- Oh, thanks.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.333
That will help.

06:43.250 --> 06:44.250
Thank you.

06:44.958 --> 06:47.495
Would anyone ever expect
to find anything like this

06:47.500 --> 06:49.206
on top of the carpathian mountains?

06:50.333 --> 06:51.333
No.

06:57.875 --> 06:59.285
= sir Francis.

06:59.292 --> 07:02.614
To see you again after so
many years is interesting.

07:07.667 --> 07:11.364
Dr. benet, we meet at last.

07:11.375 --> 07:12.956
But we already know each other.

07:12.958 --> 07:14.164
True.

07:14.167 --> 07:15.327
You've come to see me fail,

07:15.333 --> 07:16.914
but you'll be disappointed.

07:16.917 --> 07:19.579
I have come to see that
sir Francis isn't deceived.

07:19.583 --> 07:21.448
Your doubts are very flattering.

07:21.458 --> 07:23.198
They are mutual.

07:23.208 --> 07:25.039
We have never seen eye to eye.

07:25.042 --> 07:26.202
That is because I've always

07:26.208 --> 07:28.449
looked 200 years ahead of your theories.

07:28.458 --> 07:29.458
= Dr. rukh?

07:30.208 --> 07:31.163
You haven't met me.

07:31.167 --> 07:32.202
Oh, lady Stevens.

07:32.208 --> 07:34.164
Nor my nephew, Ronald Drake.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.161
And you too are a scientist, sir?

07:37.167 --> 07:38.498
No, I'm afraid not.

07:38.500 --> 07:40.365
He doesn't know a thing about science.

07:40.375 --> 07:41.706
But he's one of the three living men

07:41.708 --> 07:43.494
who crossed the mountains of the moon,

07:43.500 --> 07:44.910
made maps of the country.

07:44.917 --> 07:48.114
And since that's where we're
going, he'll come in useful.

07:48.125 --> 07:49.740
Very commendable work, sir.

07:49.750 --> 07:50.739
Good man.

07:50.750 --> 07:52.240
I've seen him tested in Africa.

07:52.250 --> 07:54.206
I read that you were going to Africa.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.039
That's why I asked you here.

07:56.042 --> 07:58.078
Because what I have to
show you after dinner

07:58.083 --> 08:01.575
concerns Africa, and the
claim I made many years ago.

08:15.458 --> 08:17.164
= all of this makes a man like me

08:17.167 --> 08:19.579
feel quite small and useless.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.619
But you've gone into
uncharted places, too.

08:21.625 --> 08:24.116
Oh, my explorations have
all been on this planet.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.535
They reach into space.

08:30.083 --> 08:32.369
= this is the nebula in Andromeda.

08:48.833 --> 08:52.451
A ray from this nebula will be caught here

08:52.458 --> 08:53.994
and electrically transferred

08:54.000 --> 08:55.661
to the projector in my laboratory.

08:56.583 --> 08:59.700
There I will recreate what is recorded

08:59.708 --> 09:00.743
on that beam of light.

09:03.542 --> 09:05.453
From Andromeda?

09:05.458 --> 09:07.369
From Andromeda.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.991
Three-quarters of a million
light-years distant.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.581
= can he do that?

09:23.583 --> 09:24.413
Yes.

09:24.417 --> 09:25.417
He will not fail.

09:26.708 --> 09:28.039
He must not.

09:28.042 --> 09:29.248
It would kill him.

09:29.250 --> 09:30.990
Have you seen it?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.490
= no one has seen it but janos.

09:38.167 --> 09:39.577
= you'll wait here a few minutes.

09:39.583 --> 09:40.914
I'll prepare the projector.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.457
He seems very confident.

09:52.458 --> 09:53.458
Yes.

09:54.250 --> 09:56.036
Of course, the theory of reproducing

09:56.042 --> 09:58.033
vibrations from the past is not new.

09:59.292 --> 10:02.455
But if proved, would be. = yes.

10:02.458 --> 10:05.200
This may be very interesting.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.494
Yes, very.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.617
Doesn't all this sort
of thing ever affect you?

10:10.625 --> 10:12.365
Oh, no, I'm used to it.

10:12.375 --> 10:14.616
My father was assistant here.

10:14.625 --> 10:18.823
When he died three years
ago, I married Dr. rukh.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.957
Oh, I see.

10:50.417 --> 10:51.417
I am ready.

11:09.417 --> 11:12.580
A new development of barium crown glass

11:12.583 --> 11:14.869
which will protect you
from all dangerous rays.

12:08.167 --> 12:11.079
To reproduce what is written
upon the beam from Andromeda,

12:11.083 --> 12:14.575
we must travel out into
space upon that ray of light

12:14.583 --> 12:16.699
until we reach a point at which we turn

12:16.708 --> 12:18.369
and look back upon our own planet.

12:25.792 --> 12:26.792
We approach the moon.

12:27.750 --> 12:31.117
Dead ashes, where there
is no air or water.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.867
In the shadows, colder than our arctic.

12:33.875 --> 12:37.322
In the sunlight, hotter than
any desert of the earth.

12:37.333 --> 12:40.450
Saturn we pass, with its twirling rings.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.995
A vast cloud of tiny movements,

12:43.000 --> 12:45.207
each moving in its own orbit.

12:45.208 --> 12:48.700
Another constellation speeds towards us.

12:48.708 --> 12:51.575
The great nebula of Orion.

12:51.583 --> 12:53.949
500 light-years distant.

12:53.958 --> 12:57.155
But we travel at a speed
far greater than light,

12:57.167 --> 12:59.909
the pace of electric magnification.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.908
Otherwise it would take
a million lifetimes

13:01.917 --> 13:03.327
to reach our goal.

13:03.333 --> 13:08.077
We move by this chaotic
mass and see Andromeda,

13:08.083 --> 13:12.076
our nearest neighbor among
the island universes of space.

13:12.083 --> 13:14.870
The light which we see left
there before man existed,

13:14.875 --> 13:16.240
before our earth had cooled.

13:17.292 --> 13:19.704
We speed towards this nebula

13:19.708 --> 13:21.289
and stop at a point where we will see

13:21.292 --> 13:25.706
our own planet, the earth,
as it existed long ago.

13:34.667 --> 13:38.660
Years ago, sir Francis, I voiced a belief

13:38.667 --> 13:41.659
that a great meteor bearing an element

13:41.667 --> 13:44.249
even more powerful than radium,

13:44.250 --> 13:45.660
struck an uncharted spot

13:45.667 --> 13:48.249
somewhere in the continent of Africa.

13:48.250 --> 13:50.787
If you will bear with me for a moment,

13:50.792 --> 13:54.580
I'll show you how 1
know this to be a fact.

14:47.167 --> 14:48.282
That is all.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.156
=- a trick?

14:54.167 --> 14:55.167
No.

14:55.917 --> 14:56.917
Reality.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.661
But where has it gone?

15:03.917 --> 15:05.703
Back into space.

15:05.708 --> 15:07.414
What did we see?

15:07.417 --> 15:10.033
What you saw tonight actually occurred

15:10.042 --> 15:12.624
a few thousand million years ago.

15:12.625 --> 15:14.081
J see.

15:14.083 --> 15:15.664
A tour in time.

15:15.667 --> 15:16.998
Exactly.

15:17.000 --> 15:18.331
Everything that ever happened

15:18.333 --> 15:20.415
has left its record on nature's film.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.408
Every sound since eternity began

15:22.417 --> 15:27.366
still vibrates, recorded
somewhere in outer space.

15:27.375 --> 15:29.206
The cataclysm you witnessed tonight

15:29.208 --> 15:31.540
traveled back to us on
the ray from Andromeda.

15:31.542 --> 15:32.782
Well, I'm dazed.

15:32.792 --> 15:34.623
Dazed, that's all I can say.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.035
You have demonstrated something

15:36.042 --> 15:39.409
that I have always regarded
as an unsupported theory.

15:39.417 --> 15:41.203
I'm at a loss for words.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.414
I congratulate you.

15:49.875 --> 15:51.706
Perhaps you'd all like some Brandy.

15:51.708 --> 15:54.245
Oh, thank you, that
would be most acceptable.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.831
I'll join you in a few moments.

16:04.333 --> 16:05.698
Well, I, for one, am just beginning

16:05.708 --> 16:07.664
to recover from what we've seen.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.658
= t don't think I ever shall.

16:09.667 --> 16:10.667
It was unbelievable.

16:12.500 --> 16:15.947
Well, sir, your
discovery is breathtaking.

16:15.958 --> 16:18.244
When do you plan to release
it to the world of science?

16:18.250 --> 16:19.831
Oh, not for some time.

16:19.833 --> 16:21.073
It's not nearly ready yet.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.449
And if there should
be this meteoric deposit

16:23.458 --> 16:25.119
of an unknown element in Africa...

16:25.125 --> 16:26.365
= there is.

16:26.375 --> 16:29.663
It'd be interesting
to discover what it is.

16:29.667 --> 16:30.656
Very.

16:30.667 --> 16:32.703
Will you consider joining forces with us

16:32.708 --> 16:34.289
and accompany our expedition?

16:35.542 --> 16:37.749
You ask me to join forces with you?

16:38.792 --> 16:40.248
But you forget I have no standing

16:40.250 --> 16:42.411
with your scientific congress.

16:42.417 --> 16:45.955
I believe I have even
been called unorthodox.

16:45.958 --> 16:46.868
Oh, nonsense.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.911
Our expedition isn't under the auspices

16:48.917 --> 16:50.453
of any association.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.039
You will be doing us an honor.

16:54.458 --> 16:55.618
Yes, I'll go with you.

16:56.708 --> 16:57.708
Why not?

16:58.417 --> 16:59.417
No, janos.

17:06.500 --> 17:07.500
Why?

17:08.417 --> 17:10.248
It will not be wise for you to go.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.660
I'm listening, mother.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.992
Even though you may
make a great discovery,

17:19.000 --> 17:20.331
you'll not be happy.

17:21.708 --> 17:24.745
You are not used to people, janos.

17:24.750 --> 17:25.865
You never will be.

17:27.292 --> 17:30.079
Your experiments are your friends.

17:30.083 --> 17:31.914
Leave people alone.

18:16.417 --> 18:19.249
Where do you suppose that
madman rukh is, anyway?

18:19.250 --> 18:21.241
After all, it is his own business

18:21.250 --> 18:24.207
if he wishes to go off on
an exploration of his own.

18:24.208 --> 18:28.121
See, Stevens, the little
creature is going to live.

18:28.125 --> 18:29.911
See his flesh glow.

18:29.917 --> 18:32.749
He moves his arm with much more strength.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.581
Very interesting.

18:34.583 --> 18:38.326
This proves, I think
that human organisms

18:38.333 --> 18:40.790
are only part of astrochemistry,

18:40.792 --> 18:43.329
controlled by radial forces from the sun.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.415
Oh, I never doubted your theory.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.366
What have you been using?

18:48.375 --> 18:49.581
= zithilium.

18:49.583 --> 18:53.576
One milligram, drawn directly
from the spectrum of the sun.

18:53.583 --> 18:54.618
Turn it off.

19:10.833 --> 19:12.369
Interesting.

19:12.375 --> 19:14.661
But I must admit I'm quite
ready to leave Africa

19:14.667 --> 19:17.124
the moment that your
experiments are completed.

19:17.125 --> 19:20.538
After eight weeks of this,
I admit that I'm fed up.

19:34.042 --> 19:37.409
I know every wheeze and
every crack of every record.

19:53.042 --> 19:55.454
Glad to see signs of rhino about.

19:55.458 --> 19:57.039
We'll go out after them tomorrow.

19:57.042 --> 19:59.203
Yes, you've only got six to your credit.

19:59.208 --> 20:00.539
Oh, well, they're such
nasty-tempered beasts,

20:00.542 --> 20:02.248
it's a pleasure to dispose of them.

20:18.708 --> 20:20.323
This must be lonely for Diana.

20:21.458 --> 20:22.618
= of course.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.365
It's your fault.

20:24.375 --> 20:26.081
Why do you say that?

20:26.083 --> 20:27.948
Oh, Ronnie, the way
you two avoid each other

20:27.958 --> 20:29.494
is most pointed.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.331
Why can't you be pleasantly
friendly with her

20:31.333 --> 20:33.119
as you were at first?

20:33.125 --> 20:36.868
Well, if you must
know, I don't dare to be.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.866
Becoming interested?

20:38.875 --> 20:39.864
Yes.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.160
I thought so.

20:41.167 --> 20:42.167
You're in love.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.615
Well, what could be more natural?

20:46.625 --> 20:49.116
An African moon, two
healthy young animals.

20:49.125 --> 20:49.989
Oh, stop it.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.456
We're not animals, and that's just it.

20:51.458 --> 20:54.291
And it isn't too easy,
so please don't make us

20:54.292 --> 20:55.907
into fiction for your book.

20:57.625 --> 21:00.947
Well, you are interested.

21:05.583 --> 21:07.244
Oh, so you're back, Arabella.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.457
Yes, we got an antelope
and a fine leopard.

21:09.458 --> 21:11.540
My ankles are worse.

21:11.542 --> 21:14.739
I tell you, I'm getting
heartily sick of Africa.

21:14.750 --> 21:17.412
And I don't see any use in
waiting for rukh any longer.

21:17.417 --> 21:19.658
It's evident he has elected to desert us.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.953
Well, we can't go and
leave his wife here alone,

21:21.958 --> 21:24.074
even though he's forgotten she came along.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.240
After all, she is
rukh's affair, not ours.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.615
She is my affair.

21:28.625 --> 21:29.455
I'm fond of her.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.164
Well, I'm not fond enough of anyone

21:31.167 --> 21:33.123
to make this my permanent abode.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.081
Temba, more water, please.

21:36.417 --> 21:37.417
Ah, ah!

22:43.500 --> 22:44.785
Choco.

22:45.958 --> 22:47.414
The small package.

22:53.125 --> 22:54.956
Boss, put on hat, very hot here.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.457
Boss found place he look
for many days now, maybe?

23:00.458 --> 23:01.618
= there's no doubt of it.

23:01.625 --> 23:03.536
No doubt of it.

23:03.542 --> 23:06.374
Safari boys no like this place, boss.

23:06.375 --> 23:07.865
Why not?

23:07.875 --> 23:10.912
Look in pit, fall in, many devil.

23:10.917 --> 23:12.123
= pick me out a runner.

23:12.125 --> 23:15.037
I want to send a letter to
the main camp immediately.

23:15.042 --> 23:16.042
Me do.

23:22.875 --> 23:24.081
This boy go.

23:24.083 --> 23:25.493
He very fast.

23:25.500 --> 23:26.500
= hold box.

23:36.250 --> 23:38.787
How long will he take
to reach the main camp?

23:38.792 --> 23:41.033
This time tomorrow night, he get there.

23:41.042 --> 23:42.623
All downhill. =- good.

23:43.708 --> 23:46.245
Boss, wants him to wait,
bring back answer paper?

23:46.250 --> 23:47.250
Yes.

23:51.667 --> 23:53.532
Now, give this to the young mistress.

23:53.542 --> 23:55.624
Don't say a word about where we are.

23:55.625 --> 23:57.035
And make sure he understands.

24:12.417 --> 24:14.032
Francis, are you asleep?

24:14.042 --> 24:15.953
No, my dear, I was merely trying

24:15.958 --> 24:17.539
to imagine myself at home.

24:19.917 --> 24:22.124
I'd give 10 pounds for...

24:23.042 --> 24:27.411
Antelope stew again.

24:27.417 --> 24:28.417
Take it away.

24:29.333 --> 24:30.914
I'm not up to coping with it.

24:30.917 --> 24:34.205
Oh, stop feeling so sorry for yourself.

24:43.542 --> 24:45.248
What new secrets did you draw

24:45.250 --> 24:47.241
from the sun today, Dr. benet?

24:47.250 --> 24:49.286
Proof that the sun is
the mother of us all.

24:49.292 --> 24:50.281
Is she?

24:50.292 --> 24:52.032
I wonder why she bothers about us.

24:52.042 --> 24:54.078
What are we all about anyway?

24:54.083 --> 24:56.074
Astrochemistry, my friend.

24:56.083 --> 24:57.289
Astrochemistry.

25:12.667 --> 25:14.032
= it's from janos.

25:14.042 --> 25:15.042
Excuse me.

25:21.208 --> 25:22.823
He says very little.

25:22.833 --> 25:24.994
But we're not to expect
him back for some time yet.

25:25.000 --> 25:26.365
Where is he?

25:26.375 --> 25:27.785
He doesn't say.

25:27.792 --> 25:29.077
He hopes he's on the trail

25:29.083 --> 25:30.698
of an interesting new discovery.

25:30.708 --> 25:32.573
Runner boy want take paper back.

25:37.458 --> 25:38.618
Yes, tell him to wait.

25:39.708 --> 25:40.948
Will you all excuse me, please?

25:40.958 --> 25:44.155
- But your dinner, dear.
- I'm not really hungry.

25:44.167 --> 25:46.123
I want to see the runner boy in my tent.

25:46.125 --> 25:47.615
You come, too, and talk for me.

26:02.333 --> 26:03.493
I'll be ready in an hour.

26:03.500 --> 26:05.786
I want three boys for safari.

26:10.292 --> 26:11.292
Diana?

26:14.000 --> 26:15.206
What are you going to do?

26:16.333 --> 26:18.540
There's only one thing to do.

26:18.542 --> 26:20.578
I'm going to him tonight.

26:20.583 --> 26:21.583
Tonight?

26:23.625 --> 26:24.956
= it's cooler.

26:24.958 --> 26:26.198
Besides, there's a moon.

26:27.250 --> 26:28.250
You're going alone?

26:30.083 --> 26:32.039
I can't stay here now.

26:32.042 --> 26:33.042
Why?

26:34.750 --> 26:37.116
He's a great man, Ronald.

26:37.125 --> 26:38.125
I'm his wife.

26:40.042 --> 26:43.705
He needs me, and I can't let him down.

26:43.708 --> 26:46.541
No, you wouldn't.

26:46.542 --> 26:48.828
You're not the sort to
let any man down, ever.

26:51.042 --> 26:52.828
Goodbye.

26:52.833 --> 26:54.198
Goodbye, Diana.

28:00.875 --> 28:02.365
Power.

28:02.375 --> 28:05.287
More power than man has ever known.

28:17.208 --> 28:18.948
Well, what do you want?

28:21.042 --> 28:23.328
Safari boys want go away this place.

28:23.333 --> 28:24.333
No like him.

28:25.750 --> 28:27.160
So, they want to leave me, do they?

28:27.167 --> 28:28.167
Me wanna go, too.

28:29.542 --> 28:30.542
= indeed.

28:32.875 --> 28:34.365
Do you see that rock?

28:38.625 --> 28:39.489
Yes, boss.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.957
I want you to keep
your eyes on that rock.

28:41.958 --> 28:44.415
Tell the boys to do so, too.

28:56.667 --> 28:57.667
Watch.

29:13.708 --> 29:15.323
No, I sorry, boss!

29:17.042 --> 29:20.830
You can all go if you want
to, but you won't go far.

29:20.833 --> 29:23.165
All that will be left of
you will be like that.

29:24.458 --> 29:25.458
Me stay, boss.

29:27.208 --> 29:28.163
We'll all stay.

29:28.167 --> 29:29.873
All right, then get back to work.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.241
Take the lamp inside.

29:46.250 --> 29:48.081
Draws the pests.

31:23.417 --> 31:25.032
It's poisoned me.

31:57.292 --> 31:58.292
Dead.

32:19.250 --> 32:20.786
Boss house there.

32:20.792 --> 32:21.792
Me take you.

32:22.792 --> 32:24.282
No, I'll go alone.

32:51.375 --> 32:52.706
Janos?

32:52.708 --> 32:53.948
What are you doing here?

32:55.500 --> 32:57.456
You must go away at once.

32:57.458 --> 32:58.698
At once, do you hear?

32:58.708 --> 32:59.743
= but it's Diana.

32:59.750 --> 33:01.786
You shouldn't have come.

33:01.792 --> 33:04.454
I wrote you I had important work to do.

33:04.458 --> 33:06.289
I don't want to be bothered with anyone.

33:06.292 --> 33:07.873
Oh, you must be ill.

33:07.875 --> 33:08.910
What's happened to you?

33:08.917 --> 33:10.657
Nothing's happened to me.

33:10.667 --> 33:12.953
What makes you think
anything's happened to me?

33:14.042 --> 33:15.623
It's been weeks since you left.

33:16.542 --> 33:17.827
Don't you want to see me?

33:17.833 --> 33:19.664
I don't want to see you here.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.749
This is no place for you.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.160
You must leave here at once.

33:24.833 --> 33:26.198
My place is where you are.

33:27.458 --> 33:28.458
I won't be a bother.

33:31.667 --> 33:33.749
I suppose you'll have to stay the night.

33:35.292 --> 33:37.658
My headman will find shelter for you.

33:37.667 --> 33:38.907
But I want you out of here

33:38.917 --> 33:41.283
the very first thing in the
morning, do you understand?

33:46.875 --> 33:48.365
Yes, I understand.

34:03.292 --> 34:05.328
I'm leaving as soon as it's daybreak.

34:06.250 --> 34:07.080
Yes, missy.

34:07.083 --> 34:08.083
Me tell your boys.

34:08.958 --> 34:09.958
Thank you.

35:15.833 --> 35:16.833
Benet.

35:18.708 --> 35:19.823
Benet. - Rukh?

35:20.750 --> 35:23.537
Don't let anybody know I'm here.

35:25.000 --> 35:26.456
You're exhausted.

35:26.458 --> 35:27.458
= don't touch me.

35:29.208 --> 35:31.039
What has happened?

35:31.042 --> 35:32.703
I made the runner guide me here.

35:33.667 --> 35:35.783
I've traveled day and night.

35:35.792 --> 35:37.032
But why?

35:37.042 --> 35:39.499
I found the place where the meteor fell.

35:39.500 --> 35:40.740
I've discovered an element

35:40.750 --> 35:42.832
a thousand times more
powerful than radium.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.620
But it's done something to me.

35:46.625 --> 35:48.456
Something horrible.

35:48.458 --> 35:49.573
Horrible?

35:49.583 --> 35:50.618
Look at me.

35:52.500 --> 35:54.115
Look at me in the dark.

36:05.125 --> 36:08.947
Why, you're poisoned.

36:08.958 --> 36:09.958
Poisoned.

36:10.708 --> 36:13.370
And everyone I touch is poisoned.

36:13.375 --> 36:14.375
They die.

36:15.500 --> 36:16.455
= die?

36:16.458 --> 36:19.621
Yes, I khow.

36:19.625 --> 36:21.206
Let's get back into the light.

36:32.417 --> 36:35.534
Perhaps the metal cloth
did not protect you.

36:35.542 --> 36:38.739
No, no, it gave me complete insulation.

36:38.750 --> 36:41.582
I must have been careless somehow.

36:41.583 --> 36:44.245
Benet, you know more of
the chemistry of the body

36:44.250 --> 36:45.956
than any man alive.

36:45.958 --> 36:48.324
Something must be done for
me so that I can go back

36:48.333 --> 36:50.073
and solve the power of this element.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.704
There is a counteractive
for radium poisoning

36:53.708 --> 36:55.289
derived from radium itself.

36:55.292 --> 36:56.782
Have you a sample of this new element?

36:56.792 --> 36:57.792
Yes, yes.

37:00.542 --> 37:01.542
There.

37:03.208 --> 37:04.744
Do you think I can be helped?

37:04.750 --> 37:07.913
I can't say until I deduce
the atomic structure of this.

37:07.917 --> 37:08.917
I've done that.

37:10.625 --> 37:12.707
You'll find my calculations there.

37:12.708 --> 37:13.743
All right.

37:13.750 --> 37:15.957
Then I'll begin at once to
work out the counteractive.

37:15.958 --> 37:18.495
No one must know what's happened to me.

37:18.500 --> 37:20.741
Is there any place
where I can hide myself?

37:20.750 --> 37:22.490
Oh yes, there's a little tent in back

37:22.500 --> 37:24.115
where I store my instruments.

37:24.125 --> 37:25.786
You can keep out of sight there.

37:25.792 --> 37:26.792
I'll show you.

38:08.417 --> 38:09.417
Wake up, rukh.

38:10.417 --> 38:11.417
Wake up.

38:12.292 --> 38:13.782
You've been asleep for an hour.

38:14.708 --> 38:15.708
Look at yourself.

38:20.917 --> 38:23.329
I gave you the counteractive
exactly at midnight.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.743
My hands are not glowing.

38:25.750 --> 38:28.162
No, your hands aren't
glowing, nor your face.

38:29.750 --> 38:31.035
I can touch people now?

38:35.167 --> 38:36.167
Yes.

38:37.125 --> 38:39.707
But remember what I've told you.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.573
Nothing can ever cure you.

38:42.708 --> 38:44.369
At best, your state of poisoning

38:44.375 --> 38:46.582
can only be checked, suspended.

38:46.583 --> 38:49.905
And now that a counteractive
has gone into your bloodstream,

38:49.917 --> 38:52.989
you can only live if you
use a small amount of it

38:53.000 --> 38:57.915
at regular intervals each day
all the days of your life.

39:00.500 --> 39:02.161
Here's the formula.

39:02.167 --> 39:05.239
And if I exceed the time, what happens?

39:06.167 --> 39:08.749
Your body again becomes
the deadly machine it was.

39:09.833 --> 39:10.833
Your touch will kill.

39:11.792 --> 39:13.248
Shortly after that you will become

39:13.250 --> 39:14.740
deadly to yourself as well.

39:14.750 --> 39:16.957
If you do not use the
counteractive in time,

39:16.958 --> 39:21.201
you will literally crumble to an ash.

39:21.208 --> 39:23.494
Remember, I told you all the conditions.

39:23.500 --> 39:25.411
You accepted the risks.

39:25.417 --> 39:26.406
Yes, yes.

39:26.417 --> 39:29.830
But at least after each
treatment, I should be immune.

39:29.833 --> 39:31.118
Normal.

39:31.125 --> 39:32.831
As I told you, I don't know enough yet

39:32.833 --> 39:35.199
to say what effect the violent surcharge

39:35.208 --> 39:38.200
of poison and antidote
will have upon the brain.

39:38.208 --> 39:39.208
Yes.

39:40.333 --> 39:41.948
I took that risk.

39:46.417 --> 39:49.329
= this is the counteractive.

39:49.333 --> 39:50.743
Guard it carefully.

39:52.375 --> 39:53.785
And what do you plan to do now?

39:53.792 --> 39:55.703
Go back to my camp, complete my tests,

39:55.708 --> 39:58.040
and return here as quickly as possible.

39:58.042 --> 39:59.578
Tell no one of this.

39:59.583 --> 40:00.914
Promise me.

40:00.917 --> 40:01.917
I promise.

40:15.500 --> 40:18.332
There's no use pretending any longer.

40:18.333 --> 40:19.539
You know that I love you.

40:20.958 --> 40:22.539
I've known it for a long time.

40:23.667 --> 40:25.157
That's why I have been afraid.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.625
= of me?

40:28.292 --> 40:29.292
No, of us.

40:31.792 --> 40:33.282
Oh, Diana, why fight something

40:33.292 --> 40:34.702
that's so much stronger than we are?

40:34.708 --> 40:35.708
We must.

40:37.167 --> 40:38.167
Do you love him?

40:40.792 --> 40:42.453
My father idolized him.

40:43.375 --> 40:46.538
When he died, I promised him
that I would marry janos.

40:48.250 --> 40:49.581
What are we going to do?

40:51.417 --> 40:52.623
= tt don't know.

40:56.208 --> 40:57.869
Dinner.

40:57.875 --> 40:58.875
We must go.

41:02.458 --> 41:03.458
Yes.

41:27.042 --> 41:28.657
- Yes, boss.
- Where's Dr. rukh?

41:29.750 --> 41:31.286
Boss tent there.

41:31.292 --> 41:32.873
Oh, yes, I want to see him.

41:47.792 --> 41:48.907
= Dr. benet.

41:51.417 --> 41:52.998
How did you find this place?

41:53.000 --> 41:54.410
We listened to the drums.

41:54.417 --> 41:58.114
They talked of a white man who
made magic in the mountains.

41:58.125 --> 41:59.786
How are you feeling?

41:59.792 --> 42:01.328
No ill effects so far?

42:03.500 --> 42:04.865
So far, none.

42:04.875 --> 42:06.206
You'd better get out of the sun.

42:06.208 --> 42:07.243
= huh?

42:07.250 --> 42:08.410
Oh, ves, yes.

42:15.708 --> 42:17.039
Some water? = there.

42:21.542 --> 42:23.624
They expected you back
in camp long before this.

42:23.625 --> 42:24.740
Yes, I khow.

42:25.708 --> 42:27.915
There was always one thing more to do.

42:27.917 --> 42:30.329
Days passed, and before I knew it, weeks.

42:31.250 --> 42:33.536
I have harnessed it at last, benet.

42:33.542 --> 42:36.909
I could crumple up a city
a thousand miles away.

42:36.917 --> 42:39.954
I could destroy a nation, all nations.

42:39.958 --> 42:42.040
You have harnessed its power to destroy.

42:42.958 --> 42:44.789
Have you harnessed it to heal?

42:44.792 --> 42:46.623
That will come later,
when I devise a filter

42:46.625 --> 42:47.614
to curb its power.

42:47.625 --> 42:50.913
But in the meantime, it's
mine to experiment with.

42:52.625 --> 42:55.492
Stevens and I felt that
would be your attitude.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.866
That was why we decided your discovery

42:58.875 --> 43:02.197
was too important to be
in the hands of one man.

43:03.125 --> 43:04.080
Just what do you mean?

43:04.083 --> 43:06.290
Stevens is now on his
way to the international

43:06.292 --> 43:09.455
scientific congress that
opened in Paris last month.

43:09.458 --> 43:11.414
He's taking with him the
specimen you left with me.

43:11.417 --> 43:13.032
Why, you thieves!

43:13.042 --> 43:13.872
Thieves!

43:13.875 --> 43:16.116
You forget we came to
Africa for a common purpose.

43:16.125 --> 43:17.581
= it discovered it.

43:17.583 --> 43:19.869
= oh, the credit will be
given you for the discovery.

43:19.875 --> 43:21.035
Never fear.

43:21.042 --> 43:22.157
Oh, thieves!

43:23.208 --> 43:24.197
Thieves!

43:24.208 --> 43:26.620
We couldn't wait for you forever, rukh.

43:26.625 --> 43:29.412
Besides, your wife has been quite ill,

43:29.417 --> 43:31.874
so we decided to break up camp and go.

43:31.875 --> 43:33.240
My wife? = yes.

43:34.375 --> 43:36.491
She is on her way to Europe with Stevens.

43:36.500 --> 43:38.456
I join them at lake nyanza.

43:38.458 --> 43:40.323
Diana gone?

43:40.333 --> 43:42.324
Stevens' wife is looking after her.

43:44.167 --> 43:46.624
She asked me to hand you this letter.

43:57.417 --> 43:59.032
She doesn't believe I love her.

44:00.333 --> 44:01.698
She loves someone else.

44:03.542 --> 44:04.542
Drake?

44:05.375 --> 44:06.375
Yes.

44:07.625 --> 44:09.490
To come like thieves in the night

44:10.417 --> 44:11.998
and steal everything from me.

44:13.417 --> 44:15.078
Get out of here, benet!

44:15.083 --> 44:16.619
Get out before I...

45:06.375 --> 45:08.582
Don't move, mother.

45:08.583 --> 45:09.868
Sit quite still.

45:16.917 --> 45:19.454
In a few moments, we will know.

45:57.333 --> 45:58.333
Look.

45:59.042 --> 46:00.042
Hand, hand.

46:02.542 --> 46:03.542
Yes.

46:06.042 --> 46:07.042
Yes.

46:09.542 --> 46:11.123
Yes, I see.

46:14.625 --> 46:15.956
T can see!

46:23.708 --> 46:26.245
You see everything?

46:26.250 --> 46:30.118
More clearly than I ever saw before.

46:30.125 --> 46:31.125
Oh.

46:33.167 --> 46:35.624
I am frightened by what I see.

46:40.625 --> 46:43.082
I have harnessed it, harnessed it.

46:44.542 --> 46:46.282
It's mine at last.

46:46.292 --> 46:50.160
You have work to do that
will take you all your life.

46:51.708 --> 46:53.539
Tomorrow I leave for Paris.

46:55.917 --> 46:56.917
No.

46:57.750 --> 46:59.456
No, stay here and work.

47:01.167 --> 47:02.532
I must go, mother.

47:03.750 --> 47:06.457
You will find tragedy there.

47:06.458 --> 47:07.458
I know.

47:11.542 --> 47:13.828
In case I do find tragedy,

47:15.875 --> 47:17.490
I leave my secret with you.

47:17.500 --> 47:19.240
It is all there.

47:19.250 --> 47:21.457
More power than man has ever possessed.

47:22.792 --> 47:27.161
Power to heal, power to destroy.

47:27.167 --> 47:28.373
Guard it for me.

48:12.583 --> 48:14.574
Don't be afraid, my dear.

48:14.583 --> 48:16.323
You will be all right.

48:16.333 --> 48:17.618
= I'm not afraid.

48:17.625 --> 48:18.831
= that is fine.

48:23.083 --> 48:24.368
Load it, please.

48:41.083 --> 48:42.493
I'm Dr. janos rukh.

48:55.042 --> 48:56.042
Come, please.

48:59.042 --> 49:00.782
Baby, baby.

49:01.792 --> 49:03.157
Can you see me?

49:03.167 --> 49:05.374
Yes, mommy, I can see you.

49:05.375 --> 49:07.661
Oh!

49:07.667 --> 49:08.667
My baby.

49:10.750 --> 49:12.832
Where does one find Dr. benet?

49:12.833 --> 49:14.289
I am janos rukh.

49:14.292 --> 49:15.452
= janos rukh?

49:15.458 --> 49:17.039
Dr. benet is in his laboratory.

49:17.042 --> 49:18.703
I will show you there immediately.

49:21.667 --> 49:25.159
Now you must go, make
way for the others.

49:25.167 --> 49:26.327
Prepare the next patient.

49:38.042 --> 49:41.330
Thank you.

49:41.333 --> 49:42.789
My baby can see.

49:42.792 --> 49:44.077
My baby can see.

49:45.708 --> 49:49.155
- Yes, mommy, I can see.
- Oh, baby, baby.

49:53.417 --> 49:54.417
= rukh.

49:57.000 --> 50:00.242
I seem to have arrived
at an interesting moment.

50:00.250 --> 50:02.081
You have arrived to
see what your discovery

50:02.083 --> 50:03.698
has done for this little one.

50:03.708 --> 50:04.788
She was blind.

50:04.792 --> 50:05.998
It has made her see.

50:11.042 --> 50:12.327
Thank you.

50:12.333 --> 50:14.164
Oh, thank you.

50:14.167 --> 50:16.704
Thank you, doctor, thank you.

50:24.750 --> 50:25.785
= that's all for now.

50:32.500 --> 50:35.992
It seems, as usual, I am a little late.

50:36.000 --> 50:40.414
No, all Paris is waiting
to pile honors on you.

50:40.417 --> 50:43.580
You know, of course, the nobel
prize was awarded to you.

50:43.583 --> 50:45.665
Yes, yes, I know, I know.

50:46.583 --> 50:49.120
Everybody considers you
and sir Frances Stevens

50:49.125 --> 50:50.831
very generous men.

50:54.208 --> 50:55.698
I wondered about your health.

50:56.667 --> 50:58.783
= the counteractive is still effective.

51:00.792 --> 51:02.123
And Diana?

51:02.125 --> 51:03.456
Oh, she is well.

51:03.458 --> 51:05.449
She has become lady Arabella's secretary.

51:07.625 --> 51:10.162
She and Drake plan to marry, of course?

51:10.167 --> 51:12.078
They are in love, but she declares

51:12.083 --> 51:14.699
she will do nothing
until she hears from you.

51:14.708 --> 51:16.915
She will hear of me, shortly.

51:18.042 --> 51:20.579
I will not stand in the
way of their happiness.

51:20.583 --> 51:22.619
This is very fine of you, rukh.

51:25.375 --> 51:28.538
Well, I must leave you
to your ministrations.

51:28.542 --> 51:30.373
You see, I was right, rukh.

51:30.375 --> 51:33.367
Your discovery is too great
for one man to control.

51:33.375 --> 51:35.707
Some day you will realize
that you haven't even

51:35.708 --> 51:38.199
scratched the possibilities of radium x.

51:38.208 --> 51:40.790
And I am still the only
man to control it fully.

52:17.583 --> 52:19.448
Yes, you'll do.

52:19.458 --> 52:21.619
Same height, same width.

52:22.708 --> 52:24.369
What do I want?

52:24.375 --> 52:26.582
I want to do you a benefit.

52:33.958 --> 52:35.448
Yes.

52:35.458 --> 52:37.995
The greatest benefit
one man can do another.

52:45.333 --> 52:47.369
Those who have never seen the moonlight

52:48.458 --> 52:53.407
over the African veldt have
missed a thrilling vision

52:53.833 --> 52:57.200
which can be witnessed in no other land.

52:57.208 --> 53:01.076
A lion caught in the Thorn bush and...

53:01.083 --> 53:02.539
Milady.

53:02.542 --> 53:04.282
Briggs, you have been instructed

53:04.292 --> 53:06.704
never to interrupt me
when I am at dictation.

53:06.708 --> 53:08.915
- But the paper, milady.
- The papers?

53:08.917 --> 53:10.498
You know I never read them.

53:10.500 --> 53:12.411
This is important.

53:12.417 --> 53:13.417
Oh, very well.

53:20.125 --> 53:21.125
What is it?

53:57.833 --> 54:01.325
With all my worldly goods I thee endow.

54:01.333 --> 54:04.700
With all my worldly goods I thee endow.

54:04.708 --> 54:09.327
Whom god hath joined together,
let no man put asunder.

54:20.125 --> 54:21.786
- Goodbye, dear.
- Goodbye, darling.

54:21.792 --> 54:22.907
- Ronnie, dear.
- Goodbye, dear.

54:22.917 --> 54:25.784
I'm sure you'll
both be very, very happy.

54:25.792 --> 54:27.248
- Bon voyage.
- Goodbye, my boy.

54:27.250 --> 54:28.786
Goodbye.

55:00.458 --> 55:01.458
Six.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.000
Six of us.

55:46.333 --> 55:48.494
Are you the manager? = yes.

55:48.500 --> 55:49.865
Have you a room vacant?

55:49.875 --> 55:51.957
A front room? - A room?

55:51.958 --> 55:53.869
Providentially, sir, I have.

55:53.875 --> 55:55.206
Step this way, sir.

55:57.000 --> 56:00.663
It's Mrs. legrand, sir, I'm
British to the backbone,

56:00.667 --> 56:02.658
though misfortunes and a French husband

56:02.667 --> 56:04.032
has brought me to Paris lodgings.

56:04.042 --> 56:05.407
You'll like the room.

56:05.417 --> 56:08.534
It's a lovely fireplace
and it don't smoke,

56:08.542 --> 56:11.374
and the bed is excellent.

56:11.375 --> 56:14.367
Me poor husband, he died
in it so comfortable.

56:21.000 --> 56:22.615
= I'll take the room.

56:22.625 --> 56:24.456
And I'd like the Paris
herald every morning.

56:24.458 --> 56:25.868
Yes, sir.

56:25.875 --> 56:29.572
That will
be 50 francs a week, sir.

56:29.583 --> 56:30.583
Oh, oh.

56:38.958 --> 56:40.323
Thank you, sir.

56:48.583 --> 56:52.405
Sir Francis Stevens, thief.

56:56.000 --> 56:58.537
Have you ever seen
anyone so incredibly happy

56:58.542 --> 57:00.078
as Diana and Ronald when they started

57:00.083 --> 57:01.448
on their honeymoon?

57:01.458 --> 57:03.414
I hope they will be happy.

57:03.417 --> 57:05.624
We should be late if
Francis doesn't hurry.

57:07.083 --> 57:08.914
Go to sir Francis' room and tell him

57:08.917 --> 57:10.282
Dr. benet and I are waiting.

57:14.333 --> 57:15.698
Poor dear.

57:15.708 --> 57:17.323
When he came from his lecture tonight

57:17.333 --> 57:19.619
at the university, he
was so utterly exhausted

57:19.625 --> 57:21.081
that I told him to lie down.

57:24.583 --> 57:27.370
He is feeling better since
we returned from Africa?

57:27.375 --> 57:28.205
Oh, yes.

57:28.208 --> 57:30.915
He has even forgotten to
complain about his ankles.

57:33.125 --> 57:34.125
What's that?

57:44.542 --> 57:46.703
Celeste, Celeste.

57:46.708 --> 57:47.993
Speak, you fool.

57:48.000 --> 57:49.000
What is it?

57:54.667 --> 57:57.704
Dr. benet, come up please, at once.

57:57.708 --> 58:00.199
- Pierre.
- Sir Francis.

58:00.208 --> 58:01.208
Sir Francis!

58:11.375 --> 58:12.375
= oh!

58:17.625 --> 58:18.625
Oh.

58:20.042 --> 58:21.157
This is awful.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.161
Look at his eyes.

58:26.167 --> 58:29.079
What hideous thing did
he see, do you think?

58:29.083 --> 58:31.290
The police must be sent for at once.

58:32.750 --> 58:33.956
But before they come,

58:35.667 --> 58:37.828
I would like to try an experiment.

58:37.833 --> 58:40.700
It must be done before
the eye tissues glaze.

58:42.750 --> 58:43.865
Yes.

58:43.875 --> 58:45.706
= is there an ultraviolet camera here?

58:48.167 --> 58:50.533
Yes, I'll get it for you.

58:50.542 --> 58:51.542
Please.

59:25.667 --> 59:26.667
Rukh.

59:27.417 --> 59:28.417
I knew it.

59:49.208 --> 59:52.530
In New York, in Rome.

59:57.625 --> 59:58.625
= come in.

1:00:01.167 --> 1:00:02.407
Good morning, sir.

1:00:02.417 --> 1:00:04.499
Good morning, Mrs. legrand.

1:00:04.500 --> 1:00:07.037
Oh, there's more excitement.

1:00:07.042 --> 1:00:08.157
Yes.

1:00:08.167 --> 1:00:10.453
What has happened across the street?

1:00:10.458 --> 1:00:11.538
Vandals, sir.

1:00:11.542 --> 1:00:13.453
They come in the night and they smashed

1:00:13.458 --> 1:00:15.244
the entire one of them figures.

1:00:15.250 --> 1:00:16.239
They didn't leave nothing

1:00:16.250 --> 1:00:18.206
but a little pile of melted stuff.

1:00:18.208 --> 1:00:19.789
But that's impossible.

1:00:19.792 --> 1:00:21.657
That's what everybody says.

1:00:21.667 --> 1:00:23.282
But a fact's a fact, sir.

1:00:23.292 --> 1:00:24.657
If you'll excuse me, sir,

1:00:24.667 --> 1:00:26.908
I'll just pop across and
see what the latest is.

1:00:26.917 --> 1:00:28.373
Yes, Mrs. legrand.

1:00:28.375 --> 1:00:30.411
Do come back and tell me more.

1:00:30.417 --> 1:00:31.623
Well, I'll find out, sir.

1:00:31.625 --> 1:00:35.322
I won't be a second,
I'll find out all I can.

1:01:08.375 --> 1:01:11.742
Lady Stevens, matchmaker.

1:01:15.875 --> 1:01:18.366
= radium x claims third victim.

1:01:18.375 --> 1:01:20.707
Paris edition of the New York herald.

1:01:20.708 --> 1:01:22.869
Radium x claims third victim.

1:01:26.583 --> 1:01:29.780
Radium x claims third victim.

1:01:29.792 --> 1:01:32.158
Radium x claims third victim.

1:01:33.125 --> 1:01:35.787
Radium x claims third victim.

1:01:56.458 --> 1:01:57.458
No, please.

1:02:05.375 --> 1:02:08.162
It will be better, I think,
if you take Diana away.

1:02:08.167 --> 1:02:09.532
I will answer any questions.

1:02:09.542 --> 1:02:11.498
We'll be downstairs if you do need us.

1:02:18.292 --> 1:02:20.578
Now I will explain why I insisted

1:02:20.583 --> 1:02:22.574
the medical examiner and his assistants

1:02:22.583 --> 1:02:25.871
wear insulated gloves
when they touch the body.

1:02:25.875 --> 1:02:27.240
Will you turn out the lights?

1:02:38.917 --> 1:02:41.283
Look closely at the neck of the victim.

1:02:46.792 --> 1:02:47.792
Lights, please.

1:02:50.458 --> 1:02:52.574
You observe those finger marks

1:02:52.583 --> 1:02:53.914
cannot be seen in the light.

1:02:53.917 --> 1:02:56.203
It is phosphorus, possibly?

1:02:56.208 --> 1:02:57.208
No.

1:03:00.333 --> 1:03:01.914
Radium x.

1:03:01.917 --> 1:03:04.408
Inflicted by the grasp of someone

1:03:04.417 --> 1:03:05.748
contaminated by the poison.

1:03:07.125 --> 1:03:08.831
Do you know such a person?

1:03:08.833 --> 1:03:09.993
Only one, he is dead.

1:03:11.167 --> 1:03:13.954
But there is a story behind all this.

1:03:13.958 --> 1:03:16.415
And I am going to ask you
to listen to some facts.

1:03:18.417 --> 1:03:19.577
= there's some curse.

1:03:19.583 --> 1:03:22.996
Diana, my dear, there are
no such things as curses.

1:03:24.250 --> 1:03:26.411
Well, they needn't look
any farther for the murderer.

1:03:26.417 --> 1:03:28.157
Here she is. - Stop it!

1:03:28.167 --> 1:03:29.532
I won't let you talk like that.

1:03:29.542 --> 1:03:32.329
If I hadn't left him, they
would all be alive today.

1:03:32.333 --> 1:03:34.699
Janos, sir Francis and Arabella.

1:03:34.708 --> 1:03:36.118
Stop it.

1:03:36.125 --> 1:03:37.331
We loved each other.

1:03:37.333 --> 1:03:38.789
We belong to each other.

1:03:38.792 --> 1:03:40.202
You never belonged to him.

1:03:40.208 --> 1:03:42.324
And no law of nature or
man can make it anything

1:03:42.333 --> 1:03:43.948
but right for us to have done what we did.

1:03:43.958 --> 1:03:47.280
He shan't reach out of his
grave and spoil our lives.

1:03:47.292 --> 1:03:48.292
I'll fight it.

1:03:49.208 --> 1:03:51.494
But what are you going to fight?

1:03:51.500 --> 1:03:53.161
Something you can't see?

1:03:53.167 --> 1:03:54.998
Something you can't reach?

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.490
Something you can't touch?

1:03:59.125 --> 1:04:00.285
Oh, darling.

1:04:00.292 --> 1:04:01.292
Hold me tight.

1:04:01.958 --> 1:04:04.415
We're going to need
each other so very much.

1:04:05.500 --> 1:04:09.288
Yes, I have feared something like this

1:04:09.292 --> 1:04:11.954
ever since the day he left my laboratory.

1:04:11.958 --> 1:04:13.869
And I always doubted his death.

1:04:16.458 --> 1:04:19.074
So now you know all I have to tell you.

1:04:19.083 --> 1:04:21.165
You believe that the man who was buried

1:04:21.167 --> 1:04:23.283
as Dr. rukh was not Dr. rukh?

1:04:23.292 --> 1:04:24.828
Yes.

1:04:24.833 --> 1:04:27.074
I believe that rukh is alive and in Paris.

1:04:28.792 --> 1:04:32.614
I believe that this city
is at the mercy of a madman

1:04:32.625 --> 1:04:34.957
whose body is an engine of destruction.

1:04:34.958 --> 1:04:36.289
I talked to his mother on the telephone

1:04:36.292 --> 1:04:38.829
a little while ago, and
it is also her belief

1:04:38.833 --> 1:04:40.198
that rukh is alive.

1:04:40.208 --> 1:04:42.415
We will take immediate
steps to locate him.

1:04:43.667 --> 1:04:44.667
Gentlemen.

1:05:17.792 --> 1:05:21.705
A figure melted while a
crowd of people watched.

1:05:21.708 --> 1:05:24.415
Only one element on
earth could have done it.

1:05:24.417 --> 1:05:26.658
Diana and I were married at that church,

1:05:26.667 --> 1:05:28.373
and there were six of us in Africa.

1:05:30.125 --> 1:05:31.865
Do you suppose rukh's crazy brain

1:05:31.875 --> 1:05:33.740
drew some analogy between that fact,

1:05:33.750 --> 1:05:36.241
and the six figures of
the saints on the church?

1:05:36.250 --> 1:05:40.038
He killed two of us and
destroyed two of the six figures.

1:05:40.042 --> 1:05:41.657
= a man and a woman in each case.

1:05:41.667 --> 1:05:44.409
You and your wife must go
into seclusion immediately.

1:05:44.417 --> 1:05:48.535
Also you, Dr. benet, while we
comb Paris for this madman.

1:05:48.542 --> 1:05:51.579
It might be simpler
to get him to come here.

1:05:51.583 --> 1:05:53.164
How do you propose this?

1:05:53.167 --> 1:05:54.247
Ask him for dinner?

1:05:54.250 --> 1:05:55.365
No, not quite.

1:05:55.375 --> 1:05:56.911
But that's the general idea.

1:05:56.917 --> 1:05:58.498
Let the newspapers give out a story

1:05:58.500 --> 1:05:59.990
that the three remaining survivors

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:02.412
of our African expedition
are leaving Paris immediately

1:06:02.417 --> 1:06:04.157
for an unknown destination.

1:06:04.167 --> 1:06:06.283
But before departing, there
will be a meeting here.

1:06:06.292 --> 1:06:08.374
What sort of meeting?

1:06:08.375 --> 1:06:10.616
Well, what do you think
would draw him, doctor?

1:06:10.625 --> 1:06:13.913
A lecture concerning
my recent experiments

1:06:13.917 --> 1:06:17.785
with radium x, and a
chance to reach you and me.

1:06:17.792 --> 1:06:20.158
You are both willing to take such risk?

1:06:20.167 --> 1:06:21.577
= of course.

1:06:21.583 --> 1:06:23.073
Yes.

1:06:23.083 --> 1:06:25.495
I will invite a limited
number of scientists,

1:06:25.500 --> 1:06:27.081
to be admitted by card only.

1:06:27.083 --> 1:06:29.699
Do you think it's fair to
expose them to the danger?

1:06:30.708 --> 1:06:33.040
There are only two
people he wants to destroy.

1:06:34.125 --> 1:06:36.912
Two, or perhaps three.

1:06:36.917 --> 1:06:38.873
My men can check the list of invitations

1:06:38.875 --> 1:06:42.163
at the gate and maybe capture him there.

1:06:42.167 --> 1:06:44.158
Also mingle with your guests.

1:06:44.167 --> 1:06:45.247
Exactly.

1:06:45.250 --> 1:06:47.741
I will set the hour of
midnight for the lecture.

1:06:47.750 --> 1:06:49.957
At that time his luminosity will be strong

1:06:49.958 --> 1:06:51.914
as he will delay taking the counteractive,

1:06:51.917 --> 1:06:54.203
hoping for a chance to use his deadliness

1:06:54.208 --> 1:06:55.618
upon Drake and me.

1:06:55.625 --> 1:06:59.243
If your men fail to
capture him at the gate,

1:07:01.417 --> 1:07:03.749
and darken the entire house.

1:07:03.750 --> 1:07:06.241
His face and hands will appear like,

1:07:06.250 --> 1:07:09.868
like phosphorus,
regardless of any disguise.

1:07:09.875 --> 1:07:13.367
And if he touches anyone?

1:07:17.458 --> 1:07:18.458
They die.

1:07:35.292 --> 1:07:37.203
- Professor lemaire.
- Professor lemaire.

1:07:37.208 --> 1:07:40.371
- Professor gothe.
- Professor gothe.

1:07:43.083 --> 1:07:45.950
- Dr. benet.
- Professor reinhardt.

1:07:49.958 --> 1:07:52.916
A very strange hour for such
a meeting, don't you think?

1:07:52.917 --> 1:07:53.952
Perhaps.

1:07:53.958 --> 1:07:56.791
But radium x is a very strange subject.

1:07:56.792 --> 1:07:59.704
Benet has his reasons.
Undoubtedly.

1:07:59.708 --> 1:08:02.120
He must have something
of importance to show us.

1:08:02.125 --> 1:08:04.241
Even the president of
our congress is here.

1:08:16.292 --> 1:08:18.624
Professor meiklejohn,
if I am not mistaken?

1:08:18.625 --> 1:08:20.081
Yes, I am meiklejohn.

1:08:20.083 --> 1:08:20.913
Who are you, sir?

1:08:20.917 --> 1:08:23.499
Jones, of the university of wales.

1:08:23.500 --> 1:08:26.457
We met once, but perhaps
you don't recall me.

1:08:26.458 --> 1:08:28.073
= t think I do.

1:08:28.083 --> 1:08:29.994
One meets so many people.

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:32.992
I shall never forget your
treatise on radiation, sir.

1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.412
Oh, you remember that, huh?

1:08:35.417 --> 1:08:36.497
No doubt you are on your way

1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:38.786
to Dr. benet's demonstration.

1:08:40.833 --> 1:08:42.573
= it should indeed.

1:08:42.583 --> 1:08:45.541
I understand that no one is
to be admitted without a card.

1:08:45.542 --> 1:08:46.372
Yes.

1:08:46.375 --> 1:08:47.956
Oh, that reminds me.

1:08:49.875 --> 1:08:51.831
Yes, yes, I've got it.

1:08:51.833 --> 1:08:52.993
Forgetful sometimes.

1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.911
Well, under the circumstances.

1:08:54.917 --> 1:08:55.781
= of course.

1:08:55.792 --> 1:08:57.077
A nasty night.

1:08:57.083 --> 1:08:58.539
Most disagreeable indeed.

1:08:58.542 --> 1:09:00.328
I think I've caught a chill.

1:09:01.833 --> 1:09:03.323
Napoleon Brandy, sir.

1:09:03.333 --> 1:09:06.996
I believe a sip or two
would help us on our way.

1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.992
I suggest that we step
in here, out of the rain.

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:11.365
I am not very much on spirits,

1:09:11.375 --> 1:09:15.448
but considering the night, why.

1:09:45.125 --> 1:09:47.207
Dr. Reno. = Dr. Reno.

1:09:47.208 --> 1:09:49.745
- Dr. Fergie.
- Dr. Fergie.

1:09:54.625 --> 1:09:58.538
- Professor meiklejohn.
- Professor meiklejohn.

1:10:11.208 --> 1:10:13.745
All are here, except one name.

1:10:13.750 --> 1:10:16.366
To be admitted instantly.

1:10:16.375 --> 1:10:19.617
Beaudine, you will stand
at the main house switch.

1:10:19.625 --> 1:10:22.947
It is to be thrown at
exactly 12:00 o'clock.

1:10:37.542 --> 1:10:39.328
No stranger has tried to come in,

1:10:39.333 --> 1:10:41.745
and all invitations are accounted for.

1:10:41.750 --> 1:10:42.910
Perhaps he won't come.

1:10:43.875 --> 1:10:44.875
He will be here.

1:10:45.833 --> 1:10:46.913
Probably he's here now.

1:10:56.417 --> 1:10:57.748
Monsieur le president.

1:10:57.750 --> 1:10:58.750
Oh, Dr. benet.

1:11:05.625 --> 1:11:08.457
If you will be patient for
just a few minutes longer,

1:11:08.458 --> 1:11:11.746
I will make final adjustments
in my laboratory and be ready.

1:12:07.250 --> 1:12:08.365
We expected you.

1:12:08.375 --> 1:12:10.115
T knew that.

1:12:10.125 --> 1:12:11.706
Five thieves.

1:12:11.708 --> 1:12:14.370
Two are gone, three are left.

1:12:14.375 --> 1:12:16.081
Do you intend to kill us all?

1:12:16.083 --> 1:12:17.083
Yes.

1:12:17.875 --> 1:12:20.366
I felt it was better to let things alone

1:12:20.375 --> 1:12:22.240
when you were first poisoned.

1:12:22.250 --> 1:12:24.081
I warned you about your brain.

1:12:24.083 --> 1:12:26.495
It began to affect my
brain almost immediately.

1:12:26.500 --> 1:12:30.413
I could feel it coming,
crawling for cells.

1:12:30.417 --> 1:12:32.203
Aren't there ever moments when you think

1:12:32.208 --> 1:12:35.200
as you used to think, when you were human?

1:12:35.208 --> 1:12:36.994
Not often now, not often.

1:12:38.500 --> 1:12:40.491
= and because of that we must die.

1:12:40.500 --> 1:12:41.990
No, because you are thieves.

1:12:42.000 --> 1:12:44.582
Five thieves, all thieves.

1:12:44.583 --> 1:12:46.619
It will be easiest just to shake hands.

1:12:47.542 --> 1:12:49.533
It will all be over in a second.

1:13:01.292 --> 1:13:02.281
My wife?

1:13:02.292 --> 1:13:05.249
In her room with Mrs.
Noyer, as you desired.

1:13:05.250 --> 1:13:06.365
But she's nervous, sir.

1:13:07.458 --> 1:13:08.914
So am I.

1:13:08.917 --> 1:13:11.203
Still, it will soon be
over, one way or the other.

1:13:11.208 --> 1:13:12.072
Yes, sir.

1:13:12.083 --> 1:13:13.744
One way or the other.

1:13:15.875 --> 1:13:17.957
I know something awful has happened.

1:13:17.958 --> 1:13:20.620
Try to compose yourself, madame.

1:13:20.625 --> 1:13:23.162
I can't stand this any longer.

1:13:23.167 --> 1:13:24.953
Find Mr. Drake and tell
him I must see him,

1:13:24.958 --> 1:13:26.448
if only for a moment.

1:13:26.458 --> 1:13:28.039
= t was ordered to remain here.

1:13:28.042 --> 1:13:29.532
Oh, please go.

1:13:29.542 --> 1:13:31.328
Oh, as you say, madame.

1:13:55.958 --> 1:13:56.993
Madame rukh.

1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:58.331
It's good of you to come.

1:13:58.333 --> 1:14:00.073
It's my duty to be here.

1:14:01.375 --> 1:14:02.831
Where is Diana?

1:14:02.833 --> 1:14:05.199
Oh, she's upstairs in her room.

1:14:44.208 --> 1:14:45.823

1:14:45.833 --> 1:14:47.494
Ronnie!

1:14:47.500 --> 1:14:48.500
= Diana.

1:14:50.250 --> 1:14:51.250
= janos!

1:15:34.125 --> 1:15:37.697
Strange Dr. benet doesn't
return, don't you think?

1:15:37.708 --> 1:15:39.323
Yes, very strange.

1:15:49.292 --> 1:15:50.748
Dr. benet?

1:15:50.750 --> 1:15:52.115
Dr. benet!

1:15:57.917 --> 1:15:58.917
He isn't here.

1:16:01.167 --> 1:16:02.167
Yes, he is.

1:16:03.500 --> 1:16:05.036
And so is rukh.

1:16:05.042 --> 1:16:06.157
Don't go any closer!

1:16:06.167 --> 1:16:07.998
Max, Louie, the front stairs.

1:16:13.667 --> 1:16:18.036
No, I can't kill you, I can't.

1:16:18.042 --> 1:16:19.327
But he must die.

1:16:23.500 --> 1:16:25.115
No, janos!

1:16:33.208 --> 1:16:34.208
Mother.

1:16:45.583 --> 1:16:46.583
No.

1:16:54.708 --> 1:16:56.448
= t must have time.

1:16:56.458 --> 1:16:58.164
I must go on to reach one more.

1:16:59.083 --> 1:17:00.664
Drake.

1:17:00.667 --> 1:17:02.498
= don't fire.

1:17:12.250 --> 1:17:13.250
My son.

1:17:15.042 --> 1:17:18.409
You have broken the first law of science.

1:17:23.167 --> 1:17:25.328
Yes, you are right.

1:17:25.333 --> 1:17:26.618
It's better this way.

1:17:33.167 --> 1:17:34.452
Goodbye, mother.

1:17:48.833 --> 1:17:49.833
Dianal

1:17:52.708 --> 1:17:53.708
Diana.

1:17:59.708 --> 1:18:01.824
My darling, you're safe.

1:18:03.458 --> 1:18:08.327
Madame rukh, permit
me to pay you my homage.

1:18:10.958 --> 1:18:12.664
Janos rukh is dead,

1:18:14.750 --> 1:18:19.540
but part of him will go on
eternally working for humanity.
