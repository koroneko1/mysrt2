155
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:03,666
Yeah, right.

156
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,875
-But the original from the '60s.
-Of course.

157
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:08,708
-Not the one with Lindsay Lohan.
-Right. Yeah.

158
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:10,750
-The remake is terrible
-Mm. [shudders]

159
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,041
-It was awful, wasn't it?
-[chuckles awkwardly]

160
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:16,000
Anyway, if I thought
16 years was difficult,

161
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:19,500
then I found out
it's worse to be 8,000 kilometers apart.

162
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,625
You like cinema?

163
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,333
I love it.

164
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,666
I'm the same. Just love it.

165
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,083
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

166
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,083
Um, what have you seen lately
that you really liked?

167
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:33,625
Um… <i>Frozen.</i>

-[laughs]
-[Álex chuckles]

170
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,916
I thought you were actually serious
for a second.

171
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,500
Uh… No, dude, no.

172
00:07:44,583 --> 00:07:46,958
My third boyfriend was
really into making jokes like that.

173
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,416
-[Álex chuckles] Sure.
-That was a good one.

174
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,541
Jaume, phew.

175
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,958
With Jaume it seemed like it would work,
but there was only one problem.

176
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,416
He's an architect also.

177
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,875
-You're an architect?
-Yes.

178
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,083
-Wow.
-Yeah…

179
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,833
But things with us…
Well, we understood each other perfectly.

180
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:05,250
-But, well, it was always about our work.
-Ah, yeah.

181
00:08:05,333 --> 00:08:08,458
All of our discussions ended up
being about Zaha Hadid.

182
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,041
-Do you know her?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah…

183
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,125
[Javi] Control yourselves…

184
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,958
-Huh?
-Zaha Hadid.

185
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:16,541
-[Javi] Now, you, there in the corner…
-Ah, yes. I'm sorry. I just misheard you.

186
00:08:16,625 --> 00:08:18,958
-Really?
-I love her work.

187
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,583
-Yeah, me too. It's… She's unbelievable.
-Wow.

188
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:23,250
Yeah, I just… Wow.

189
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,208
[both chuckle]

190
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,541
It's incredible, isn't it?

191
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,583
How she can integrate
such innovative volumes

192
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,041
in her environment so organically?

193
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,958
I say the same thing,
when they ask me about Zah… um…

194
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,916
I say the volumes are organic.

195
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,583
Exactly, that's right…

196
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,791
And what other architects do you like?

197
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,166
Uh… Well, um…

198
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,458
-[doorbell jingles]
-Look…

199
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,416
[Javi] Anyway, speaking of secrets…

200
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,625
-Would you give me a minute?
-Of course. No, please, uh…

201
00:08:45,708 --> 00:08:47,291
-Do what you have to.
-Sorry, it's just…

202
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,708
-Yeah, sure, of course.
-Okay.

203
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,125
[Javi] Darlings, listen up…

204
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:51,958
Hey. What took you so long?
Everything okay?

205
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,041
Look, Patri's pissed. Rightly so.

206
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,041
Well, if you need to go,
I've got this handled.

207
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:56,958
No, it's crowded.

208
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,708
Well, I'll ask Javi for help
after the show.

209
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:02,875
No. He won't be able to because I'm gonna
strangle him once he gets off that stage.

210
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,041
Stop. Mm-hmm.

211
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,875
-[Javi] It's true, though.
-[spectators laugh]

212
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:07,041
What about your date?

213
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,958
-[Javi continues performing]
-Uh…

214
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,916
-Well, I don't think it will really last.
-Yeah. He's not your type.

215
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,041
No, at first I thought the same thing,

216
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,708
but the more I learn,
the more I'm interested.

217
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,791
-So what's the problem?
-He doesn't stop talking.

218
00:09:19,875 --> 00:09:21,458
Ah. He doesn't listen?

219
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,166
No, no. I don't have anything to say.

220
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,916
Bring up something
you're passionate about.

221
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,125
-Like what?
-Do I need to tell you?

222
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,791
-[Javi laughs]
-[spectators applaud]

223
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,583
-Go on.
-[Javi] Can you believe it?

224
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,041
I bared my soul to her.

225
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,750
And, bitch, it was somebody else!

226
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,833
[laughing]

227
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,000
Oh, thanks, guys.

228
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:48,791
Thank you. I mean it. Thank you so much.

229
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,583
And remember,

230
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:55,125
nobody can tell you what you have to be
or what you need to feel.

231
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:58,625
And, if anyone tries to,
then what is your response?

232
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:00,250
[spectators] Keena Mandrah!

233
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,666
Of course. Keena Mandrah. "How boring!"

234
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,583
Ah. I'm going to go powder my nose,
but I'll see you all for the second half.

235
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,875
Don't wander off too far
like Cala Calobra, who loves the bathroom.

236
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,500
And get more drinks, bitches.

237

-My feet.
-[door opens]

240
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,708
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What just happened?

241
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,458
Hey, honey, I just apologized to you.
And in public too, like a real artist.

242
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,625
Javi, nobody knew about the offer,
not even Patri.

243
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:31,583
[exclaims]

244
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,916
Oh, I'm sorry.

245
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,083
Why didn't you warn me?

246
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,000
How could I warn you?

247
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,458
As soon as I told you,
you started screeching like a piglet.

248
00:10:37,541 --> 00:10:39,625
You want me to take the blame
for you fighting?

249
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,250
Well, yeah, I blame you.

250
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,875
Because you can't just go out on stage
and talk about people's lives like that.

251
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:49,625
I'm sorry but actually 50% of my show
consists of exactly that, okay?

252
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,166
-I am not one of your fans.
-Of course you are!

253
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,291
Look. I'm being serious, Javi.

254
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,833
Oh, you want me to get serious?

255
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,791
Very well, then. Sure, let's get serious.

256
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,041
I'll start us off.

257
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,333
The problem here is not
that I publicly announced

258
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,458
to your girlfriend
that you were going to Ibiza.

259
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,083
The problem is that
you haven't told your girlfriend yet

260
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,291
that you were going to Ibiza
when you've known about it.

261
00:11:10,875 --> 00:11:12,208
I was waiting for the right time.

262
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,291
Well, the right time is here and now.

263
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,416
So you can thank me.

264
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:19,291
That's not how you handle it.
It's something too important to just go--

265
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,541
[sighs] If it's so important
to you, honey, then,

266
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:23,916
Vero, what the hell
are you still doing here?

267
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,041
Why aren't you with Patri
trying to fix things right now?

268
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,541
[Rosa]<i> Fix what exactly?</i>

269
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:40,125
Your retirement. You can retire soon.

270
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,625
There's nothing to fix.

271
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:44,500
[scoffs] I've been working there
since I was 15 years old.

272

once I'm pushing daisies.

[Ramiro chuckles]

274
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,708
But enough about me, what about you?

275
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,791
I'm not the one with an adventurous life.

276
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,791
You've traveled all over the world.

277
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,500
And I'm sure you have
thousands of exciting stories.

278
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,791
A new romance in each port.

280
00:12:08,166 --> 00:12:10,416
You must have had
a lot of admirers yourself.

00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:11,875
Oh, no way.

282
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,666
Not a single one. Not since Juan passed.

-I don't believe you.
-[chuckles]

284

I'm not saying I was a nun.

285
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:21,166
But nothing got serious.

286
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:24,958
I couldn't imagine life
if it wasn't with Juan.

287
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,708
That's normal.

288
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:31,625
The person you love leaves,
but the love… remains with you.

296
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:53,000
have you been happy all these years?

297
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:55,416
I have.

298
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,333
Really happy.

299
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,916
Why don't you go… and set the table?

300

The tablecloth is in the top drawer
of that cabinet over there.

[Bruno] I mean,
you see everything, really.

Well, you know, there are so many
profiles out there, it's overwhelming.

303
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:48,666
But then there are these architects
who are paid millions of dollars,

304
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:50,500
but their buildings fall down
after two days.

305
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:51,708
Those are the worst ones.

306

what we call them? "The Crookitechts."

00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:57,125
-You get it? It's--
-What gym do you train at?

308
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:59,458
-Uh, what?
-Well, I go to the Metropolitan.

309
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:02,708
But now I've just signed up for the Club
Natació Barceloneta 'cause of the pools.

310
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:05,375
I mean, their workout room sucks,
but it has private beach access.

311
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:07,458
And you have no idea how cool it is

312
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:10,833
to finish a workout and jump
straight into the ocean. [chuckles]

313
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,375
[chuckles nervously]

314
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:16,041
-Um… You go to two gyms?
-Yeah. But they're affordable, actually.

315
00:14:16,125 --> 00:14:19,791
And, besides, the deltoid machines over
at the Metropolitan are so much better.

316
00:14:19,875 --> 00:14:22,625
I mean, you should see
the machines they have at the Barceloneta.

317
00:14:22,708 --> 00:14:24,083
I mean, it's embarrassing.

318
00:14:24,166 --> 00:14:26,291
All of my friends think
that we need to just

319
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,875
write a letter and complain about it.

320
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,208
I mean, you can't have
three calf machines…

321
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:32,625
Three! And not be able
to train your shoulders, right?

322
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:34,833
-It's unacceptable… Intoler--
-Right! Intolerable.

323
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,125
-[Àlex] And that can't be allowed.
-No. No, no, no.

324
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:38,250
[both chuckle]

325
00:14:38,333 --> 00:14:40,833
-Do you go every day? Uh…
-No, man, no.

326
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,541
-No? Uh…
-No, no. Sundays I don't.

327
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,416
Do you spend long hours?

328
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:48,708
-Well…
-No. A few, max!

329
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,750
Oh.

330
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,583
-I'm not obsessed like that.
-Oh, yeah.

331
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,500
[both chuckle]

332
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:54,791
But now that summer is coming,
maybe I'll do CrossFit.

333
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,375
-Ah, it's still just December…
-Yeah, yeah.

334
00:14:57,458 --> 00:14:59,166
But it's never too late to begin.

335
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,416
And, besides, now we have New Year's Eve
and Carnival parties coming soon…

336
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,333
[Bruno] Hmm.

337
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:05,166
So you don't do it for yourself?

338
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,250
What are you saying?

339
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:09,958
Well, you spend the week working out
just to show your abs at a party?

340
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,166
Wait a minute.
I work out because I like it.

341
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,333
And it makes me feel good. So what?

342
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:18,666
But if I'm at a party, and I wanna
take my shirt off or something,

343
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,708
I can, right?

344
00:15:19,791 --> 00:15:20,958
Hmm.

345
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:23,208
[Àlex chuckles]

346
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,416
Uh, where's the bathroom? Is it…

347
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,375
The bathroom is in… the rear.

348
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:31,875
Oh, okay. I'm, uh…

349
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:32,875
[both chuckle]

350
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:35,166
[chuckles, exhales deeply]

351
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,250
The guy is dumb… a real idiot.

352
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,708
He's a bartender. Come on.

353
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,708
How many times have I said no bartenders?

354
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,583
No bartenders and no actors.

355
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,833
How many?
I mean, you can't sink any lower.

356
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,375
[grunts, sighs]
Weren't you so in love though?

357
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:50,916
-I mean, he's really hot.
-[chuckles]

358
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,583
He's very hot. But he's… a walking cliché.

359
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,041
Like Queen Mother of gays.

360
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,916
[chuckles] Oh, hey. Does that mean
you're coming to dinner, then?

361
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,791
Yes. Yeah, anything but this.

362
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,500
-Yes!
-But no costume.

363
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,791
No, no, no, no.
Bruno, Just grab something on the way.

364
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:05,833
What are you saying?
Everything's closed already.

365
00:16:05,916 --> 00:16:06,916
-I'm not--
-I'll bring one.

366
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,666
Yeah, I have my daughter's angel wings.

367
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:11,375
Just wrap a sheet into a tunic,
and you're good.

368
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,375
Yeah? And what am I supposed to be?

369
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,083
-Are you kidding right now?
-Perfect.

370
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:17,166
Daedalus, who built
the labyrinth of the Minotaur.

371
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:19,000
Yes, I know who Daedalus is.

372
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:21,291
Great. Well, just get yourself
to the restaurant,

373
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:22,750
and I'll take care of the rest.

374
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,291
-Okay, yeah.
-Okay, Bruno.

375
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:25,625
-See ya in a bit.
-Okay.

376
00:16:25,708 --> 00:16:28,250
[clears throat] Oh, hey.
Be careful on the way.

377
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,166
Why?

378
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:32,625
Don't get too close to the sun.
You know how it ended for Icarus.

379
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,250
-Ugh, you're such a pain. Really.
-[laughs]

380
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:37,083
Huh. Call dropped.

381
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,583
-Can you start Tuesday, next week?
-Um, yeah.

382
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,500
The problem is picking the kids up
from school.

383
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,708
'Cause, when Albert can't go get them,
I normally go, but…

384
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:46,833
Yeah, well, I'm going to be
at the restaurant.

385
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,791
All good things have to end.

386
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,750
I'm thrilled to have a job again.

387
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:52,500
-[chuckles] Really.
-[chuckles]

388
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:56,041
It'll just be the night shift, so Albert
can have the kids during the day.

389
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,541
-Okay.
-[Albert] But use "them."

390
00:16:57,625 --> 00:17:00,541
-Albert, don't start with that. Come on.
-No, we've talked about it, Núria.

391
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:03,375
-And we said there's no need.
-Yes, there absolutely is a need.

392
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,625
Just 'cause Ariel has a penis
doesn't necessarily mean they're a boy.

393
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:08,625
So, until they express
their sense of gender,

394
00:17:08,708 --> 00:17:10,041
we prefer to continue with "they."

395
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,250
Albert prefers it.

396
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,625
All of a sudden, he wants
to be the most progressive parent.

397
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,458
But, look, use whatever's easiest.

398
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:18,791
-But keep it neutral if you can, yeah?
-[Núria sighs]

399
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,750
-Honestly, I might forget that.
-Sure.

400
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,125
But it's really easy.
Look, let me give you an example.

401
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,500
"They, they."

402
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,333
"They are awake already."
Always use "they."

403
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,958
Except in Catalan, huh?
In Catalan we'd add an "I".

404
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,958
-Do you speak Catalan?
-Albert, no more.

405
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,208
I don't want to perpetuate
gender stereotypes.

406
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:37,166
We never did it with Artur or Julia,
and they're just fine, all right?

407
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:40,250
And, one day, <i>if</i> one of them
turns out to be trans,

408
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,041
we'll help them however we can.

409
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,458
-[phone rings]
-All right?

410
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:46,291
-Sorry. Excuse me for just a moment.
-[Najat] Yeah, sure.

411
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,041
[Núria] Yes, hello.

412
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,250
Oh my God. Is it bad?

413
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,000
[lively music plays]

414
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,750
-Najat, isn't it?
-Yeah.

415
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:00,500
Where you from?

416
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:01,541
Here.

417
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:04,000
Yes, of course.
I only meant, uh, which neighborhood--

418
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,833
Look, I know what you meant.

419
00:18:05,916 --> 00:18:08,083
So progressive
and yet still so old-fashioned.

420
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,958
[Núria] Right, yes. Yes, I understand.

421
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,750
Okay, don't worry. I'll be right there.

422
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:14,291
Yes, I'll tell Albert,
and I'll see you soon.

423
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,458
[clears throat]

424
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:21,208
It was work.

425
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:24,833
The chef has had an accident,
and I have to cover her.

426
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:26,791
You have to cancel the dinner.

How long did you know, then?

We had just gotten the apartment,

I didn't think I'd be selected.

There were other candidates.
It wasn't just me.

457
00:19:41,875 --> 00:19:45,125
But you were chosen,
and you didn't say anything.

458
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,833
I didn't know how to tell you, Patri.

459
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:49,541
-You were so happy about the apartment I--
-Of course I was happy.

460
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:52,291
But you know what I would have loved
even more, Vero?

461
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,375
Knowing that my girlfriend got the job
of her absolute dreams

462
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,958
and was accepting the offer.

463
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,333
And to be able to celebrate that together.

464
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,583
Because I would have been happy for you.
Or do you really think that I wouldn't?

465
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,375
I don't know. I don't know.

466
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,375
Did you really think I'd hold you back?

467
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,833
-Me?
-[somber music plays]

468
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,083
You don't know me at all, do you?

469
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,500
I spent five months
organizing this dinner. Five!

470
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,708
I planned this before Ariel was even born.

471
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,166
I know. What do you want me to do?

472
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,083
They lost the chef
in the middle of a rush.

473
00:20:25,166 --> 00:20:27,041
You're still on leave.
They can't force you.

474
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:28,500
I want to go. I'm not being forced.

475
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:30,750
It doesn't matter. It's illegal.
They can't even ask you.

476
00:20:30,833 --> 00:20:34,000
I'm starting on Tuesday, and I'm sure
you understand not wanting to disappoint.

477
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,291
You'd rather disappoint me.

478
00:20:35,375 --> 00:20:37,125
It's just a dinner,
not the end of the world.

479
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:38,916
This isn't just some dinner, Núria.

480
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,541
I mean, people are coming
from out of town just for this.

481
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:44,000
I might never see any of them again.
It's been 15 years.

482
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,208
Don't be so dramatic.

483
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,791
Easy for you to say.
Your plans aren't being ruined.

484
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,083
-What did you say?
-It's true.

485
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,125
-Look, I've had to give up plenty.
-Is that so?

486
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,708
More than you.
More important than a shitty dinner.

487
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:55,250
It's not my fault that you're bitter.

488
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,208
-What?
-Because that's what makes you happy.

489
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,000
Knowing I don't get to have fun.
Not even for one day. One fucking day!

490
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,541
Albert, you can go parachuting
for all I care.

491
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,041
-But not today. Get it?
-[knocking]

492
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,291
[both shout] What is it?

493
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,875
You're arguing really loud.

494
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,625
-But can the kids hear?
-[sighs]

495
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,041
They're in the kitchen.

496
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:13,875
Um… [clears throat]
I'm free to stay with them.

497
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:17,500
No, no. Najat, we can't impose--

498
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:20,250
No, no, no. Núria, she said
she's free, right? Didn't you, Najat?

499
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,458
It's really no problem.

500
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,750
So there we go!

501
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:24,833
[Núria] Hmm.

502
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:26,916
Well, thanks.

503
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,208
-[Albert] Yeah.
-[Núria] I'll tell the kids.

504
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,416
-[Najat] Bye.
-[Albert chuckles]

505
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,916
[giggles, exclaims]

506
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,750
[clears throat, steadies breath]

507
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,291
I owe you one, Najat.

508
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:40,833
'Kay.

509
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:46,458
[pop music plays]

510
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:48,166
Sorry.

511
00:21:56,666 --> 00:21:57,500
Sorry.

512
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,041
Well…

513
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,041
Did you go see Dua Lipa?

514
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:07,666
Uh… Uh-uh.

515
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,583
Her concert was sold out,
but my ex was able to get me in as a VIP.

516
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:13,333
Ah, well, that's great.

517
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:14,625
[chuckles nervously]

518
00:22:16,916 --> 00:22:18,541
You don't go out much, do you?

519
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:21,416
Yes, but I feel more comfortable
in different bars.

520
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,875
Oh. Like where?

521
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,958
Like… Well, let me think…

522
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,000
La Federica, for example, in Poble Sec.

523
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,208
Mm… Don't know it.

524
00:22:28,291 --> 00:22:30,250
-I don't think you would like it.
-Yeah? Why?

525
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:32,791
Well, it's not like this. It's different.

526
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,208
Well, different in what way?

527
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:38,250
It's just a bit more… more alternative.
Not so much posing.

528
00:22:40,916 --> 00:22:43,250
-Posing?
-Yeah. Well, you know what I mean.

529
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:46,125
[scoffs] You're saying
the guys at my bar are posing?

530
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,458
-No…
-That they're fake?

531
00:22:47,541 --> 00:22:49,458
-No. I didn't say that.
-So what are you saying?

532
00:22:49,541 --> 00:22:52,666
No, I mean, the type of clients here
are different. It makes sense, though.

533
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,833
Oh yeah? Yeah, they love posing 'cause
they think they're better than everyone.

534
00:22:55,916 --> 00:22:57,375
-No, no, no.
-Tell me about your bar.

535
00:22:57,458 --> 00:22:59,333
I wasn't saying that.
I didn't mean to upset you.

536
00:22:59,416 --> 00:23:00,416
I'm not upset.

537
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,916
-You love posing.
-Then tell me.

538
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,416
Fuck, nobody there looks down on you

539
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,125
if you don't look like
you've overdosed on clenbuterol.

540
00:23:06,208 --> 00:23:09,750
Doesn't matter if you have crooked teeth,
or you're straight out of a Bel Ami movie.

541
00:23:09,833 --> 00:23:11,291
-Àlex.
-[shouts] What?

542
00:23:12,166 --> 00:23:15,500
-Oh, sorry. Sorry, uh… I'm sorry.
-Uh, I'm gonna go.

543
00:23:16,583 --> 00:23:18,041
Why not stay for a while.

544
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:21,000
I'll see you another day
when you're not so… busy.

545
00:23:21,083 --> 00:23:22,875
-When you have more time.
-Mm-hmm.

546
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,041
[Ibra] Mm.

547
00:23:28,125 --> 00:23:29,083
[chuckles]

548
00:23:29,791 --> 00:23:30,916
Call me, okay?

549
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:39,208
He can stay, 'cause I'm going.
It's clear he's more your type.

550
00:23:39,291 --> 00:23:40,791
What makes you think that?

551
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:44,958
Answer me honestly, Álex. Okay?

552
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:48,333
If you'd seen my photo on Instagram
or anywhere, would you have met me?

553
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,833
-Hm?
-Well, why not?

554
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,583
Because guys like you
never date guys like me.

555
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,083
Even if that were true,
haven't you ever wondered why that is?

556
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:58,000
Well, it's clear. You're only interested
in a guy's physique.

557
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,250
-Did anyone tell you that?
-No…

558
00:23:59,333 --> 00:24:00,916
-Did anyone say you're ugly.
-There's no--

559
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,750
-Or not hot enough?
-That's not the point.

560
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:03,833
Because they didn't.

561
00:24:03,916 --> 00:24:04,958
-Okay.
-That's it, though.

562
00:24:05,041 --> 00:24:07,458
Meanwhile, you spend your life
thinking people look down on you

563
00:24:07,541 --> 00:24:09,333
and aren't interested,
which is why you end up

564
00:24:09,416 --> 00:24:11,291
sitting by yourself, looking bitter,

565
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,458
and that's why no one
would ever approach you to say hello.

566
00:24:14,541 --> 00:24:16,000
No one would anyway, regardless.

567
00:24:16,083 --> 00:24:17,375
Not with that attitude, Bruno.

568
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:19,791
And what should I do?
No, no, no. I wanna know.

569
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,416
-Should I always be smiling? No?
-[chuckles] Okay.

570
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,541
To ask questions
that are vapid and stupid?

571
00:24:24,625 --> 00:24:27,083
You know, "Are you going to Mykonos
or to Ibiza?"

572
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,041
-Come on…
-No, wait.

573
00:24:28,125 --> 00:24:30,666
Should we talk about Eurovision
or <i>RuPaul's Drag Race?</i>

574
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,208
It's better than black and white films
from the '70s.

575
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:35,875
They'd been shooting in color
for three decades by the '70s, Álex!

576
00:24:35,958 --> 00:24:39,041
Well, whatever. The point is
that no one likes snobbish assholes.

577
00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:41,125
-I'm not snobbish.
-Bruno, please. I like movies too.

578
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:45,291
But I don't take every chance that I get
to recite a list of my favorite directors.

579
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:47,250
Yeah, because you don't even have one.

580
00:24:47,333 --> 00:24:49,208
Now you're insulting me?
What is your problem?

581
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:50,375
Oof.

582
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:53,166
This began with you.

583
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:54,666
[breathes deeply]

584
00:25:02,833 --> 00:25:03,958
[both laughing]

585
00:25:06,416 --> 00:25:07,625
[sighs]

586
00:25:16,666 --> 00:25:18,333
-You know what I don't get?
-Ah, Jesus…

587
00:25:18,416 --> 00:25:20,291
Guys like you always criticize
guys like me,

588
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:22,791
when, really though,
the only thing you want is to be like us.

589
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:24,458
No, no. I don't wanna be like you.

590
00:25:24,541 --> 00:25:25,916
-But you want to fuck me.
-Jesus!

591
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,125
No. It's what went through your mind
the second that you saw me.

592
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:31,416
But, since you assumed
that I'm not interested,

593
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,416
you got defensive
and started attacking me.

594
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,416
That's not it.

595
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,583
I need more than a gym body
to make out with some guy.

596
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:38,041
Yeah, me too.

597
00:25:38,666 --> 00:25:40,166
Yeah. Yeah, okay. Yeah.

598
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:42,333
Okay, wait a minute. Hold on.

599
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,458
Okay, you're right.

600
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,625
I'll be honest.

601
00:25:45,875 --> 00:25:48,458
If I'd seen a photo of you
after we talked,

602
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:50,708
I… probably would've said no.

603
00:25:50,791 --> 00:25:53,500
And that's because… that's because
I normally go for other guys.

604
00:25:53,583 --> 00:25:55,333
-Right. You see? That's what I was--
-Wait.

605
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:56,541
-But… But…
-Right. Yeah.

606
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:59,291
I swear, when we were in there, I thought,

607
