[female voice]
We're fated to live in solitude.

2
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,583
Because we know something
that's impossible to explain to others.

3
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,375
This world has
more than what we think we know.

4
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:19,666
My mother was both
a herbal doctor and a witch doctor.

[woman screams from a distance]

6
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,250
Aunt Sroy is a Krasue.

7
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:32,958
My mother regarded it
as a form of sickness.

8
00:01:34,041 --> 00:01:35,708
If Aunt Sroy didn't have to hunt,

9
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,041
to fight,

10
00:01:37,708 --> 00:01:39,750
and if she didn't have sexual relations,

11
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:41,833
the transformation wouldn't take place.

12
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:46,791
It's hard to understand.

13
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:51,041
The day Father told Mother to choose...

[baby cries]

15
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:57,333
she chose to take care of me
and Aunt Sroy by herself.

-Do you feel hot?
-[baby whimpers]

17
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,500
Mother must have been too tired and busy

18
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:08,291
to notice that Aunt Sroy was in love
with Uncle Singha.

19
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:10,875
Sroy!

20
00:02:11,833 --> 00:02:13,166
-Sroy.
-He was the guy

21
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,875
who brought herbs to Mother.

22
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,916
Aunt Sroy transformed because of him.

23
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,291
-Sroy.
-Because she was in love.

[sobs] Sroy.

25
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:36,083
Uncle Singha implored
that Aunt Sroy was the love of his life.

26
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,291
I'm sorry.

27
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:42,625
-[Singha] I love Sroy.
-But Mother wasn't convinced.

28
00:02:42,708 --> 00:02:44,708
She learned that Aunt Sroy was pregnant.

29
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:50,500
It was too much for her to fight alone.

30
00:02:51,958 --> 00:02:54,333
So, Mother had to teach Uncle Singha
everything.

31
00:02:55,458 --> 00:02:56,458
The spells...

32
00:02:57,833 --> 00:02:59,041
and the herbal medicine.

33
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,875
My sister could turn
into a full-fledged Krasue,

34
00:03:03,083 --> 00:03:04,208
or she wouldn't.

[baby laughing]

-[slurping]
-will turn into this.

40
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:24,000
When Mother's age-old enemies
knew that Aunt Sroy was pregnant,

41
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,625
-they came after her.
-Kaew.

42
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:26,750
Leave.

43
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:29,791
They claimed that
the child was one of their own.

44
00:03:31,625 --> 00:03:35,541
Yes, Aunt Sroy became a Krasue
because of them.

45

Both Ratree

and Duangdao.

47
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:44,458
My mother sacrificed her life,
hoping to end everything once and for all.

48
00:03:45,958 --> 00:03:47,166
But she failed.

49

She couldn't stop them.

But it was too much for Uncle.

00:04:04,416 --> 00:04:06,416
Aunt Sroy fought until her last breath.

56
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,958
Her daughter got infected
with the cursed blood.

57
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,666
And Uncle could never walk again.

58
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:23,000
Uncle tried to reverse the curse.

59
00:04:23,875 --> 00:04:26,500
He tried the spells,
then the herbal medicine.

No one knows if it's possible.

what I want to do,

will mean nothing

That's her, Mora.

Soon, she'll be 16.

That age is critical for us.

I have to go through this.

00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,583
I must save my sister.

I don't know if I can pull it off.

But I'll give it everything I've got...

They require ten drawings this year.

I don't have much time for that either.

I haven't finished even one.
