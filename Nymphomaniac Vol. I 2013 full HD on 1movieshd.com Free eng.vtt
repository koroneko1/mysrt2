05:24.170 --> 05:26.271
Hello?

05:31.077 --> 05:33.278
You've had an accident.

05:35.616 --> 05:39.117
You need an ambulance. I'll call
for one. I'll be right back.

05:40.053 --> 05:41.688
Lie still here.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.055
No.

05:43.790 --> 05:45.125
No.

05:45.126 --> 05:47.160
<i>No what?</i>

05:47.161 --> 05:50.130
I don't need an ambulance.

05:50.131 --> 05:53.899
<i>I can clearly see you do.
I'll call for one.</i>

05:54.934 --> 05:56.904
In that case, I'll be up and gone

05:56.905 --> 05:59.104
before you have the
time to come back.

06:01.474 --> 06:03.243
<i>That will hurt.</i>

06:03.244 --> 06:07.412
That's possible, but it
doesn't matter to me.

06:11.952 --> 06:14.386
<i>I assume you don't want me
to call the police either.</i>

06:15.722 --> 06:18.290
Yes, that's exactly right.

06:23.763 --> 06:26.031
Is there anything you want?

06:34.741 --> 06:38.810
I'd like a cup of
tea with some milk.

06:41.082 --> 06:43.215
Well...

06:44.651 --> 06:46.552
You have to come with me.

06:48.755 --> 06:51.523
I don't serve tea in the street.

06:54.093 --> 06:56.094
Can you walk?

06:56.830 --> 06:58.530
Yeah.

07:01.167 --> 07:03.135
I've even bought a cake.

07:11.144 --> 07:12.812
<i>I'll wash your clothes.</i>

07:12.813 --> 07:15.849
- <i>Not my coat.</i>
- It smells rather badly.

07:15.850 --> 07:17.983
It's my coat.

07:19.552 --> 07:21.186
It's your coat.

07:23.156 --> 07:25.191
So what happened?

07:25.192 --> 07:27.559
Were you robbed?

07:31.131 --> 07:34.099
It's my own fault.

07:35.568 --> 07:38.170
I'm just a bad human being.

07:39.339 --> 07:41.574
I've never met a bad human being.

07:41.575 --> 07:42.975
Well, you have now.

07:45.345 --> 07:47.079
Do you want to talk about it?

07:47.981 --> 07:50.082
<i>You wouldn't understand.</i>

07:52.285 --> 07:54.485
Well, try me.

07:56.689 --> 07:59.324
But I wouldn't know where to start.

08:08.301 --> 08:12.172
Why is that ridiculous
fishhook hanging there?

08:12.173 --> 08:14.941
<i>It's a fly.</i>

08:14.942 --> 08:16.776
<i>I caught a fish with it once,</i>

08:16.777 --> 08:18.311
a rather big one

08:18.312 --> 08:20.312
strangely enough.

08:23.082 --> 08:25.051
<i>Fly-fishing is about</i>

08:25.052 --> 08:28.354
<i>tying feathers and
other things to a hook</i>

08:28.355 --> 08:32.158
<i>so it resembles something
the fish likes to eat.</i>

08:32.159 --> 08:34.961
And then because the
fly is very light,

08:34.962 --> 08:37.462
you have to have a
line that is heavy.

08:38.698 --> 08:41.433
It creates the velocity
when you cast.

08:47.106 --> 08:48.808
You fish a lot?

08:48.809 --> 08:51.577
Well, some...

08:52.679 --> 08:54.479
But I don't catch much.

08:55.915 --> 08:57.817
<i>When I was young, I...</i>

08:57.818 --> 09:00.619
<i>I had a book I... I worshipped.</i>

09:02.155 --> 09:04.257
<i>It was an old book by Izaak Walton</i>

09:04.258 --> 09:06.925
<i>called "the complete angler."</i>

09:09.229 --> 09:13.031
<i>It was like a romantic
nature Bible to me.</i>

09:17.770 --> 09:20.639
Maybe I know where to start.

09:24.077 --> 09:26.880
But if you're to
understand, I'll...

09:26.881 --> 09:30.250
I'll have to tell you
the whole story,

09:30.251 --> 09:32.483
<i>and it'll be long.</i>

09:33.887 --> 09:36.790
Long... is good.

09:36.791 --> 09:40.025
And moral, I'm afraid.

09:49.269 --> 09:51.204
<i>To begin with the bait,</i>

09:51.205 --> 09:54.973
<i>I discovered my cunt
as a two-year-old.</i>

09:57.177 --> 09:59.012
<i>At an early age,</i>

09:59.013 --> 10:01.046
<i>I was mechanically inclined.</i>

10:01.047 --> 10:03.883
<i>Kinetic energy, for example,</i>

10:03.884 --> 10:06.986
<i>has always fascinated me.</i>

10:06.987 --> 10:10.089
<i>And my friend...
let's call her B...</i>

10:10.091 --> 10:12.758
<i>Always came up with the ideas.</i>

10:14.227 --> 10:17.696
<i>Playing frogs was one
of B's classics.</i>

10:41.388 --> 10:44.089
<i>Joe, are you all right?</i>

10:44.090 --> 10:45.724
Just a moment!

10:47.861 --> 10:49.528
<i>Are you done?</i>

10:59.272 --> 11:03.009
For Christ's sakes,
leave them alone.

11:03.010 --> 11:06.146
<i>I loved my father very much.</i>

11:06.147 --> 11:07.881
<i>He was a doctor.</i>

11:07.882 --> 11:10.884
<i>My mother's name was Katherine.</i>

11:10.885 --> 11:13.152
<i>My father called her Kay.</i>

11:14.354 --> 11:16.890
<i>I suppose she was what you'd call</i>

11:16.891 --> 11:18.490
<i>a cold bitch.</i>

11:18.491 --> 11:20.927
<i>She always had her back turned</i>

11:20.928 --> 11:22.862
<i>when she played solitaire.</i>

11:22.863 --> 11:25.464
<i>I hated solitaire.</i>

11:30.970 --> 11:32.939
<i>When we had P.E.,</i>

11:32.940 --> 11:34.574
<i>I'd climb up into the ropes</i>

11:34.575 --> 11:36.141
<i>and hang there for ages</i>

11:36.142 --> 11:39.279
<i>with the rope between my legs.</i>

11:39.280 --> 11:42.115
<i>"The sensation" we called it.</i>

11:42.116 --> 11:47.085
<i>I remember very distinctly
this word, "sensation."</i>

11:52.926 --> 11:57.162
<i>Perhaps the only difference
between me and other people</i>

11:57.163 --> 12:01.166
<i>was that I've always demanded
more from the sunset.</i>

12:01.167 --> 12:06.338
<i>More spectacular colors when
the sun hit the horizon.</i>

12:08.408 --> 12:11.375
That's perhaps my only sin.

12:14.147 --> 12:17.050
Why are you insisting
that children are sinful?

12:17.051 --> 12:20.751
Not children. Me.

12:21.553 --> 12:24.491
I don't see sin anywhere,

12:24.492 --> 12:26.558
<i>but then I'm not religious.</i>

12:26.559 --> 12:29.863
That's because you don't
know the rest of the story.

12:29.864 --> 12:32.432
And by the way, I'm
not religious either.

12:32.433 --> 12:35.401
Why would you take the
most unsympathetic aspect

12:35.403 --> 12:38.537
of religion such as
the concept of sin...

12:39.639 --> 12:42.541
And let it survive beyond religion?

12:45.445 --> 12:48.948
I don't understand
this self-hatred.

12:48.949 --> 12:51.050
That's what I said...

12:51.051 --> 12:53.684
- You wouldn't understand.
- No, I'm...

12:54.621 --> 12:56.622
I'm sorry, I'll shut up.

12:58.324 --> 13:00.159
<i>Please continue.</i>

13:11.171 --> 13:15.174
<i>Nervus pudendus.</i>

13:16.209 --> 13:21.313
<i>Nervus dorsalis clitoridis.</i>

13:51.411 --> 13:55.415
<i>My dad loved telling me about
the trees and their leaves</i>

13:55.416 --> 13:59.283
<i>and considered it part
of a good education.</i>

14:00.185 --> 14:02.622
When the ash tree was created,

14:02.623 --> 14:05.958
it made all the other trees
in the forest jealous.

14:07.127 --> 14:09.460
It was the most beautiful tree.

14:12.165 --> 14:14.932
You couldn't say
anything bad about it.

14:17.403 --> 14:19.570
Then in the winter...

14:21.573 --> 14:24.475
When the ash tree lost
all of its leaves...

14:27.347 --> 14:31.384
All the trees noticed its black
buds and started laughing.

14:31.385 --> 14:33.720
"Oh, look...

14:33.721 --> 14:37.923
The ash tree's had its
fingers in the ashes."

14:40.160 --> 14:41.660
See?

14:42.761 --> 14:45.632
You can always tell the
ash tree in winter

14:45.633 --> 14:47.598
by the black buds.

14:49.302 --> 14:51.171
<i>He especially loved</i>

14:51.172 --> 14:53.573
<i>the childish educational
stories he told</i>

14:53.574 --> 14:56.642
<i>to help me remember
what I had learned.</i>

14:58.143 --> 15:00.380
<i>I knew how much he loved
telling those stories,</i>

15:00.381 --> 15:04.016
<i>so sometimes I pretended
I had forgotten them.</i>

15:13.126 --> 15:15.060
Am I boring you?

15:15.061 --> 15:17.464
<i>No, I'm just looking forward</i>

15:17.465 --> 15:19.965
<i>to how you will get fishing
weaved into your tale.</i>

15:21.334 --> 15:24.404
You could start with the
fly on the wall there.

15:24.405 --> 15:26.473
<i>It's called a nymph.</i>

15:26.474 --> 15:30.243
It would tie in elegantly with
your discussion about nymphomania.

15:30.244 --> 15:32.512
<i>A nymph is...</i>

15:32.513 --> 15:35.913
<i>An early stage in the
life of an insect.</i>

15:37.717 --> 15:40.787
<i>As a quite young nymph,</i>

15:40.788 --> 15:44.389
it was imperative for me to
get rid of my virginity.

15:44.390 --> 15:46.023
<i>Hopla.</i>

15:47.092 --> 15:49.329
<i>I kind of knew this boy J,</i>

15:49.330 --> 15:52.464
<i>who had a moped.</i>

15:52.465 --> 15:55.000
So in my eyes, he was
rather sophisticated.

15:55.802 --> 15:57.804
<i>I was 15,</i>

15:57.805 --> 16:02.406
<i>and perhaps my girlish romantic
expectations were a bit high.</i>

16:05.445 --> 16:08.715
<i>But he had good strong hands.</i>

16:08.716 --> 16:12.384
<i>I liked his hands.</i>

16:14.154 --> 16:15.554
Hello?

16:16.456 --> 16:18.689
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:31.870 --> 16:34.107
If I asked you to
take my virginity,

16:34.108 --> 16:36.041
would that be a problem?

16:37.277 --> 16:39.111
No, I don't see a problem.

16:43.448 --> 16:45.684
So, um...

16:47.252 --> 16:50.322
Where shall I go?

17:04.671 --> 17:06.771
It's the fucking carburetor.

17:08.473 --> 17:09.741
I just can't work it out.

17:09.742 --> 17:11.410
Can you imagine that?

17:12.712 --> 17:14.479
That's not very good.

17:14.481 --> 17:16.647
<i>- Hmm?</i>
- That's not very good.

17:16.648 --> 17:20.085
<i>No, it bloody isn't. It ruins the
whole idea of having a moped.</i>

17:23.223 --> 17:25.756
You should probably take
off your knickers, yeah?

18:10.937 --> 18:14.673
<i>He shoved his cock inside me
and humped me three times.</i>

18:22.347 --> 18:27.052
<i>Then he turned me over
like a sack of potatoes...</i>

18:33.792 --> 18:36.794
<i>Then he humped me five
times in the ass.</i>

19:43.663 --> 19:47.766
<i>I never forgot those two
humiliating numbers.</i>

19:48.935 --> 19:50.769
<i>Three and five?</i>

19:50.770 --> 19:52.703
Those are fibonacci numbers.

19:55.908 --> 19:57.310
<i>That may be.</i>

19:57.311 --> 20:00.412
In any case, it hurt like hell.

20:00.413 --> 20:03.916
I swore I'd never sleep
with anyone again.

20:03.917 --> 20:06.751
<i>But of course, that only
lasted a short while.</i>

20:07.786 --> 20:10.556
And now to get back
to your fishing...

20:10.557 --> 20:15.561
<i>A couple of years later
I was at my friend B's.</i>

20:15.562 --> 20:18.697
<i>And as always,
she had a new idea...</i>

20:18.698 --> 20:21.834
<i>Financed by her younger
brother's piggy banks,</i>

20:21.835 --> 20:24.603
<i>which she regularly emptied.</i>

20:29.409 --> 20:30.943
<i>We put on clothes later known</i>

20:30.944 --> 20:34.613
<i>as the fuck-me-now clothes.</i>

20:35.681 --> 20:38.083
<i>The idea was a competition.</i>

20:38.084 --> 20:40.787
<i>We were to go on a train trip.</i>

20:40.788 --> 20:44.791
<i>B said there was no
need for tickets.</i>

20:44.792 --> 20:47.359
<i>The one who had fucked the most men</i>

20:47.360 --> 20:49.595
<i>when we reached the destination</i>

20:49.596 --> 20:52.029
<i>would win the chocolate sweets.</i>

What you were doing

21:18.992 --> 21:20.959
when you walked down
that corridor...

21:20.960 --> 21:23.728
You were reading the river.

<i>♪ Born to be wild... ♪</i>

21:43.183 --> 21:44.951
<i>Where the fish hides in the stream</i>

21:44.952 --> 21:47.451
<i>entails a very
complicated hierarchy.</i>

21:49.021 --> 21:50.622
<i>The topography decides</i>

<i>Smile and make eye contact.</i>

If you have to talk, remember

a yes-or-no answer.

22:07.540 --> 22:09.174
Then it'll just happen on its own.

22:09.175 --> 22:11.577
You just take them to the lavatory
and you have sex with them.

22:11.578 --> 22:15.180
Oh. But what if it's nasty?

22:15.181 --> 22:18.783
Then you just think of the
bag of chocolate sweeties.

22:49.815 --> 22:53.384
What... what time is it?

22:55.922 --> 22:57.255
10:00

23:11.537 --> 23:14.005
<i>where do you come from?</i>

23:15.274 --> 23:17.208
From home.

23:23.950 --> 23:26.953
Who knows where the lavatory is?

23:26.954 --> 23:28.688
<i>Well, if you take a right,</i>

23:28.689 --> 23:32.257
you will arrive at a lavatory
at the end of the car.

23:32.258 --> 23:35.227
At the same time, it is
so cleverly arranged

23:35.228 --> 23:36.728
that if you take a left turn,

23:36.729 --> 23:39.231
you will also arrive at a lavatory,

23:39.232 --> 23:42.800
<i>since at the end of the
next car there is also one.</i>

23:45.571 --> 23:47.905
I'll show you where
the lavatory is.

24:14.634 --> 24:18.004
<i>It turned out to be
shockingly easy.</i>

24:18.005 --> 24:21.005
<i>In no time, B was
ahead, five to three.</i>

24:21.773 --> 24:23.609
And it was exactly right...

24:23.610 --> 24:25.843
Look them in the eye and smile.

24:26.879 --> 24:28.747
But then suddenly it stopped.

24:28.748 --> 24:32.950
That's a very clear parallel
to fishing in the stream.

24:33.685 --> 24:34.820
As it happens,

24:34.821 --> 24:36.588
either none of the fish are feeding

24:36.589 --> 24:38.724
or they all feed at the same time.

24:38.725 --> 24:40.926
They go into feeding frenzy.

24:40.927 --> 24:42.662
All bite.

24:42.663 --> 24:46.064
And then just as suddenly
as it started, it stops.

24:46.065 --> 24:49.168
The fish most readily bite at
the beginning of a light rain,

24:49.169 --> 24:51.603
and I think that's
because they feel safe

24:51.604 --> 24:53.272
when they swim in the stream.

24:53.273 --> 24:56.008
Because they can't
be seen from above.

24:56.009 --> 24:58.876
The water's surface is disturbed.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.781
But then it started again,

25:02.782 --> 25:05.617
although a bit more slowly.

25:05.618 --> 25:08.120
Yeah, and I think I know how.

25:08.121 --> 25:11.023
Because fly-fishing can
be done in several phases.

25:11.024 --> 25:15.327
And if the fish stop biting,
you move on to phase two.

25:15.328 --> 25:18.931
And in phase two, you not
only imitate an insect

25:18.932 --> 25:21.400
but an insect in trouble.

25:21.401 --> 25:24.770
You pull... You pull the line.

25:24.771 --> 25:27.739
You tug it... Irregularly,

25:27.740 --> 25:29.675
<i>so the fish gets the
impression that</i>

25:29.676 --> 25:32.311
it's dealing with an
injured and easy prey.

25:32.312 --> 25:34.379
And then helplessly

25:34.380 --> 25:37.382
<i>let the fly float
down the river again.</i>

25:37.383 --> 25:39.251
Then half-heartedly

25:39.252 --> 25:41.452
<i>make a few jumps forward again.</i>

25:43.155 --> 25:44.923
It can be done...

25:44.924 --> 25:47.091
It can be done very elegantly.

26:00.239 --> 26:02.207
Are you all right?

26:02.208 --> 26:04.141
It's Betty.

26:05.410 --> 26:07.880
I was just told that
she's very ill.

26:07.881 --> 26:10.648
Is Betty a close family member?

26:13.285 --> 26:15.454
You could say that.

26:15.455 --> 26:18.390
She's my dwarf hamster.

26:18.391 --> 26:20.225
<i>Dwarf hamster?</i>

26:20.226 --> 26:22.227
<i>You can't be serious.</i>

26:22.228 --> 26:24.229
<i>Well, what was I to do?</i>

26:24.230 --> 26:27.866
<i>And then I did have a dwarf
hamster when I was young.</i>

26:27.867 --> 26:30.302
<i>That you were very close to?</i>

26:30.303 --> 26:32.437
<i>- Not at all.</i>
<i>- A bloody nuisance.</i>

26:32.438 --> 26:34.306
<i>Dwarf hamster.</i>

26:34.307 --> 26:37.042
It would've been worse
if it were a person.

26:37.043 --> 26:39.211
<i>Don't say that.</i>

26:39.212 --> 26:42.915
I'm extremely fond of my hamster.

26:42.916 --> 26:46.985
Yes, I think that's a rather
cynical thing to say about Betty.

26:46.986 --> 26:51.857
Yes, I had made the cage nice
and cozy for her when...

26:51.858 --> 26:54.524
- <i>When I got her.</i>
- And Betty liked that?

26:55.294 --> 26:57.830
Betty was excited.

26:57.831 --> 27:02.234
<i>One of nature's most
meaningless creatures.</i>

27:02.235 --> 27:05.103
<i>You're aware that the
choice of a dwarf hamster</i>

27:05.104 --> 27:08.207
<i>possibly suggests certain
sexual connotations.</i>

27:08.208 --> 27:09.842
<i>I can see that now,</i>

27:09.843 --> 27:13.144
<i>but it was really not
a conscious choice.</i>

27:22.187 --> 27:25.489
Can you show me where
the lavatory is?

27:26.457 --> 27:29.694
I... have to blow my nose.

27:41.874 --> 27:44.176
<i>We were running out of subjects,</i>

27:44.177 --> 27:46.445
<i>and B was ahead on points,</i>

27:46.446 --> 27:50.648
<i>which led us to S's
first-class compartment.</i>

27:54.786 --> 27:56.721
<i>Tickets, please!</i>

28:02.126 --> 28:03.462
Thank you.

28:03.463 --> 28:05.062
<i>Ladies?</i>

28:06.365 --> 28:07.732
Tickets?

28:13.438 --> 28:15.139
<i>Well...</i>

28:16.441 --> 28:19.077
I think I might've lost it.

28:19.078 --> 28:20.510
<i>Perhaps.</i>

28:22.114 --> 28:24.249
Dropped yours as well, did ya?

28:24.250 --> 28:28.253
I haven't bought a ticket
for your shitty train.

28:28.254 --> 28:30.322
It's so bloody slow,

28:30.323 --> 28:32.291
we should've been at the end
of the track half an hour ago.

28:32.292 --> 28:35.460
Regardless of delays, you still
need a ticket, sweetheart.

28:35.462 --> 28:38.196
£8 each, please.

28:40.232 --> 28:41.631
Oh!

28:42.367 --> 28:45.436
I accidentally tore it up.

28:45.437 --> 28:48.473
<i>You can't expect be to
pay for scraps of paper.</i>

28:48.475 --> 28:50.843
- Have another one.
- Oh, great idea.

28:50.844 --> 28:53.045
Oh, that one's disappeared too.

28:53.046 --> 28:55.113
<i>I can always just get the police</i>

28:55.115 --> 28:57.115
to collect your payment
at the next station.

28:57.117 --> 28:59.218
- How about that?
- Now let's just take it easy here, shall we?

28:59.219 --> 29:02.221
Apparently the young ladies
have left without any money.

29:02.222 --> 29:04.523
If it's okay with you, I'd
like to pay for their tickets.

29:04.524 --> 29:07.426
No sir, it's not. Just leave
your money where it is.

29:07.427 --> 29:09.294
- We'll let the police deal with these two.
- Actually,

29:09.295 --> 29:11.897
we did have sort of an
agreement that I was to pay.

29:11.898 --> 29:13.431
I just forgot about it.

29:16.435 --> 29:17.870
I see.

29:17.871 --> 29:20.439
Two first-class tickets...

29:20.440 --> 29:23.241
For two first-class ladies.

29:24.543 --> 29:26.544
<i>Enjoy the rest of your journey.</i>

29:29.014 --> 29:31.182
<i>Tickets, please!</i>

29:32.451 --> 29:36.319
Now that you've been
so nice to us...

29:37.389 --> 29:40.124
We'd like to be nice to you too.

29:40.125 --> 29:41.660
<i>Oh, that's very kind of you,</i>

29:41.661 --> 29:43.326
<i>but there's no need.</i>

29:47.332 --> 29:49.400
I mean that.

29:53.472 --> 29:55.273
Well, I've already lost anyway.

29:57.376 --> 30:01.746
I'm willing to give you
five extra points...

30:04.148 --> 30:06.449
If you can get that one in there.

30:08.954 --> 30:12.024
<i>I decided, perhaps
a bit desperately,</i>

30:12.025 --> 30:14.126
<i>that the only thing
standing between me</i>

30:14.127 --> 30:16.160
<i>and the bag of chocolate sweets</i>

30:16.161 --> 30:20.531
<i>was an unequivocal
provocation of this man.</i>

30:20.532 --> 30:23.235
<i>Excellent. An induced take.</i>

30:23.236 --> 30:25.636
<i>When all other attempts fail,</i>

30:25.637 --> 30:27.437
<i>a dramatic provocation can get</i>

30:27.438 --> 30:30.174
<i>an otherwise completely
passive fish to bite.</i>

30:30.175 --> 30:33.378
<i>They will react instinctively
to the right provocation,</i>

30:33.379 --> 30:36.215
<i>which would not be a
fly, but, for instance,</i>

30:36.216 --> 30:40.018
<i>a brightly-colored
wobbler, preferably red.</i>

30:40.019 --> 30:42.521
<i>The very best is one we
call "the finnish weapon,"</i>

30:42.522 --> 30:45.423
<i>the so-called rapala.</i>

30:47.326 --> 30:49.759
<i>You've bought a gift.</i>

30:51.295 --> 30:52.964
Yes.

30:54.198 --> 30:56.866
- It's for my wife.
- <i>Oh.</i>

30:57.970 --> 30:59.737
You travel first-class

30:59.738 --> 31:02.407
and you bought us our tickets.

31:02.408 --> 31:06.512
<i>Why then not buy a decent
gift for your wife?</i>

31:06.513 --> 31:09.779
I can see it comes
from the station.

31:15.988 --> 31:17.588
<i>Of course, I should have...</i>

31:17.589 --> 31:19.191
<i>Bought her something...</i>

31:19.192 --> 31:22.126
Something better, but...

31:22.127 --> 31:25.730
<i>Let's just say I was suddenly
in a hurry to get home.</i>

31:26.697 --> 31:30.035
<i>Why would a man like you</i>

31:30.036 --> 31:33.336
with such an orderly life
suddenly have to hurry?

31:36.507 --> 31:38.776
It has to do with family.

31:41.345 --> 31:43.914
My wife and I have
decided that we...

31:46.451 --> 31:49.720
We miss having children after all,

31:49.721 --> 31:52.722
and that if we are to have
children, it has to be now.

31:54.625 --> 31:58.230
So my wife called yesterday
to say that she...

31:58.231 --> 32:00.798
<i>She started ovulating.</i>

32:02.301 --> 32:05.070
<i>And all signs point
to maximum fertility</i>

32:05.071 --> 32:07.239
<i>precisely tonight.</i>

32:07.240 --> 32:09.273
You see...

32:09.274 --> 32:12.443
That's why I bought her
a gift at the station.

32:12.444 --> 32:15.579
<i>I had to get a ticket home
as quickly as possible.</i>

32:17.082 --> 32:19.350
Well, I understand now.

32:20.184 --> 32:21.587
<i>What is it you understand?</i>

32:21.588 --> 32:24.487
Why you didn't have sex with us.

32:27.558 --> 32:30.995
It wasn't because I didn't want to.

32:47.678 --> 32:49.512
<i>Please.</i>

32:53.552 --> 32:56.188
I'm begging you, please don't.

32:56.189 --> 32:58.421
It's okay.

32:59.358 --> 33:01.092
Please don't.

33:02.693 --> 33:05.563
You've been as horny as hell...

33:06.497 --> 33:08.698
But you wouldn't give up your load.

33:09.468 --> 33:11.501
Please stop.

33:36.627 --> 33:38.396
Oh God.

33:39.498 --> 33:40.865
Oh God.

33:58.417 --> 34:00.116
Wow.

34:12.531 --> 34:14.565
<i>So oral sex</i>

34:14.565 --> 34:17.168
became, in the eye of the angler,

34:17.170 --> 34:19.835
<i>your... your finnish weapon.</i>

34:21.540 --> 34:24.007
<i>Is that your only comment?</i>

34:25.377 --> 34:28.210
What else... what else
do you want me to say?

34:29.513 --> 34:32.284
That I behaved reprehensively,

34:32.284 --> 34:36.288
that already my actions
exemplify that I'm a...

34:36.289 --> 34:38.656
I'm a terrible human being.

34:39.891 --> 34:41.893
That's not the way I see it.

34:41.893 --> 34:43.960
On the contrary, I saw it as a...

34:43.962 --> 34:47.199
As a very pleasurable
and humorous story.

34:47.199 --> 34:50.935
I've consciously used
and hurt others...

34:51.869 --> 34:54.906
For the sake of my
own satisfaction.

34:54.907 --> 34:57.843
And what I've told you so far
only begins to suggest that.

34:57.844 --> 34:59.378
<i>But when you told the
story, you were...</i>

34:59.379 --> 35:02.813
You were cheerful, full of humor.

35:02.814 --> 35:05.217
<i>The only thing you've done...</i>

35:05.218 --> 35:08.220
Except giving a few people
an experience to remember

35:08.221 --> 35:12.291
is that you... you
relieved S from his load

35:12.292 --> 35:15.693
<i>in some... some youthful hubris.</i>

35:17.461 --> 35:20.432
And I read somewhere that if
you keep the load too long,

35:20.433 --> 35:21.967
the sperm will die.

35:21.968 --> 35:24.235
<i>Or worse, degenerate.</i>

35:25.636 --> 35:26.904
Maybe thanks to you,

35:26.905 --> 35:28.739
Mr. S and his wife
now have a healthy

35:28.740 --> 35:30.941
<i>and well-functioning child.</i>

35:31.877 --> 35:34.478
I discovered my power as woman

35:34.479 --> 35:37.616
and used it without any
concern for others.

35:37.617 --> 35:40.319
<i>That's completely unacceptable.</i>

35:40.320 --> 35:42.286
Oh, little darling.

35:42.287 --> 35:44.154
Don't you "little darling" me.

35:46.591 --> 35:48.224
No.

35:50.629 --> 35:52.731
What I wanted to say was that

35:52.732 --> 35:55.966
if you have wings, why not fly?

36:29.301 --> 36:31.067
No more stories.

36:32.771 --> 36:34.605
You need to sleep.

36:34.606 --> 36:36.606
No no.

36:37.608 --> 36:39.876
This is beginning to amuse me.

36:45.951 --> 36:48.618
I don't even know your name.

36:49.488 --> 36:51.689
My name is Joe.

36:52.557 --> 36:54.157
<i>I'm Seligman.</i>

36:55.694 --> 36:58.228
What a fucking ridiculous name.

36:59.399 --> 37:01.631
It's Jewish.

37:02.601 --> 37:04.569
You said you weren't religious.

37:04.570 --> 37:06.837
No, but my great-grandfather was.

37:06.839 --> 37:08.407
And my parents gave me the name

37:08.408 --> 37:10.409
as a sort of...

37:10.410 --> 37:14.478
<i>Sentimental association to Judaism.</i>

37:14.479 --> 37:17.914
But we've always been
anti-zionists...

37:19.084 --> 37:22.521
Which is not the same
as being anti-semitic,

37:22.522 --> 37:26.122
as certain political
powers try to convince us.

37:26.857 --> 37:28.894
Seligman...

37:28.895 --> 37:31.828
Means "the happy one."

37:34.932 --> 37:37.101
So are you happy then?

37:39.638 --> 37:41.938
Well, I suppose I am...

37:43.008 --> 37:44.774
In my own way.

37:45.744 --> 37:47.379
Even if I'm the kind of person

37:47.380 --> 37:49.448
who cut the nails of
the right hand first.

37:49.449 --> 37:50.780
What does that mean?

37:51.883 --> 37:54.085
Well, I divide humanity
into two groups:

37:54.086 --> 37:56.888
The people who cut the nails
on the left hand first

37:56.889 --> 37:58.757
and the people who cut the nails

37:58.758 --> 38:01.492
of the right hand first.
My theory is

38:01.493 --> 38:03.995
<i>that the people who cut the
nails of the left hand first,</i>

38:03.996 --> 38:06.531
<i>they... they... they're
more light-hearted.</i>

38:06.532 --> 38:08.799
They have a tendency
to enjoy life more

38:08.800 --> 38:12.537
because they go straight for
the easiest task and...

38:12.538 --> 38:16.106
Save their difficulties for later.

38:21.078 --> 38:22.712
So what do you do?

38:23.548 --> 38:25.684
Always the left hand first.

38:25.685 --> 38:27.951
I don't think there's a choice.

38:28.954 --> 38:31.556
Go for the pleasure first, always.

38:31.557 --> 38:34.625
And then once you've
done the left hand,

38:34.626 --> 38:37.062
only the right hand remains,

38:37.063 --> 38:40.463
and that's the easiest one left.

38:47.471 --> 38:49.707
I've never thought of it like that.

38:51.776 --> 38:54.679
Well, you... you're
never too old...

38:54.680 --> 38:56.379
Never too old to learn.

39:04.488 --> 39:06.023
<i>That's Rugelach.</i>

39:06.024 --> 39:09.760
Mm-hmm. It's a Jewish cake.

39:09.761 --> 39:11.530
<i>There's that sentimentality again.</i>

39:11.531 --> 39:13.464
No, but it's more than Rugelach.

39:13.465 --> 39:16.266
<i>It's Rugelach served
with a cake fork.</i>

39:17.768 --> 39:20.204
Rugelach, in my opinion, is pastry,

39:20.205 --> 39:23.875
which there is no excuse for
eating with a cake fork.

39:23.876 --> 39:27.646
To serve it with a cake fork
is irritatingly unmanly,

39:27.647 --> 39:30.447
<i>not to say downright feminine.</i>

39:32.183 --> 39:36.319
However it can bring us
further with the story.

39:37.955 --> 39:42.928
I also knew someone who
consumed Rugelach every day,

39:42.929 --> 39:45.931
almost ritually, with a cake fork.

39:45.932 --> 39:49.199
<i>And although we'll be
jumping a bit in time...</i>

39:50.735 --> 39:53.572
<i>I have to tell you about Jerome.</i>

39:53.573 --> 39:56.707
As far as I can see, the
next chapter doesn't contain

39:56.708 --> 39:59.810
as direct an accusation
against my person

39:59.811 --> 40:02.179
as the rest of the story.

40:02.181 --> 40:06.617
The chapter will also make a
sentimental soul like you happy,

40:06.618 --> 40:11.789
as it contains observations
on the subject of love.

41:15.620 --> 41:17.954
Can I tell you something?

41:19.724 --> 41:20.825
Sure.

41:20.826 --> 41:22.693
Sure.

41:22.694 --> 41:23.828
Yeah.

41:23.829 --> 41:24.962
Yeah sure.

41:24.963 --> 41:26.864
It might not be important to you...

41:26.865 --> 41:28.065
But it is to me.

41:28.066 --> 41:29.934
But it is to me.

41:29.935 --> 41:33.136
I've never had an orgasm before.

41:36.374 --> 41:38.275
Really?

41:42.179 --> 41:44.481
You're my first one.

41:47.118 --> 41:49.286
You don't know how
happy that makes me.

41:52.891 --> 41:55.558
I love you.

42:00.031 --> 42:02.399
You're my first.

42:05.836 --> 42:08.005
Well, I have to admit:

42:08.006 --> 42:10.574
Quite a lot of girls say that.

42:13.212 --> 42:16.647
<i>The train trip had
increased my appetite,</i>

42:16.648 --> 42:18.950
<i>and soon B and I started a club</i>

42:18.951 --> 42:22.653
<i>that we called the little flock.</i>

42:22.654 --> 42:26.224
<i>Mea vulva, mea maxima vulva.</i>

42:26.225 --> 42:28.025
<i>B, of course, took the lead,</i>

42:28.026 --> 42:30.428
<i>as she was the most daring of us.</i>

42:30.429 --> 42:32.330
<i>She was raised catholic.</i>

42:32.331 --> 42:34.733
<i>I'm sure you're familiar
with the practices</i>

42:34.734 --> 42:36.267
<i>of the catholic church.</i>

42:36.268 --> 42:38.736
<i>Mea maxima vulva.</i>

42:38.737 --> 42:40.905
<i>Mea vulva, mea...</i>

42:40.906 --> 42:42.706
<i>That's interesting.</i>

42:43.674 --> 42:46.009
Blasphemic, satanic.

42:47.044 --> 42:48.179
The music...

42:48.180 --> 42:50.314
The interval between B and F...

42:50.315 --> 42:52.250
It's a tritone,

42:52.251 --> 42:54.252
the devil's interval.

42:54.253 --> 42:57.420
It was banned from music
in the middle ages.

42:58.823 --> 43:01.259
Well, the vacuum
cleaner invented it.

43:01.260 --> 43:03.361
She took piano lessons.

43:03.362 --> 43:05.463
The vacuum cleaner?

43:05.464 --> 43:07.098
<i>The vacuum cleaner possessed</i>

43:07.099 --> 43:10.234
<i>a special talent for floppy cocks.</i>

43:10.235 --> 43:13.771
<i>She had some kind of
vacuum in her cunt.</i>

43:13.772 --> 43:17.842
I... I was imagining
something like that.

43:17.843 --> 43:19.343
It was about fucking

43:19.344 --> 43:22.079
and about having the
right to be horny.

43:22.080 --> 43:26.349
We masturbated together,
that kind of thing.

43:27.118 --> 43:29.185
But it was rebellious.

43:31.155 --> 43:33.057
We weren't allowed
to have boyfriends.

43:33.058 --> 43:35.893
No fucking the same
guy more than once.

43:35.894 --> 43:37.962
What did you rebel against?

43:37.963 --> 43:39.628
Love.

43:40.798 --> 43:42.066
Love?

43:42.067 --> 43:44.268
We were committed to combat

43:44.269 --> 43:46.736
the love-fixated society.

44:00.451 --> 44:02.920
<i>I really believed in
our little flock,</i>

44:02.921 --> 44:05.323
<i>but of course, that
was naive of me.</i>

44:05.324 --> 44:08.926
<i>Over time, even the strongest</i>

44:08.927 --> 44:11.095
<i>couldn't stay true to our manifest.</i>

44:11.096 --> 44:12.496
<i>Third of the fifth.</i>

44:12.498 --> 44:15.266
My third intercourse this week,

44:15.267 --> 44:17.701
- again with Alex.
- Third.

44:19.904 --> 44:22.739
Haven't we stated that
we fuck each guy once?

44:24.342 --> 44:27.812
I don't think you can
understand Alex.

44:27.813 --> 44:29.881
I don't want to.

44:29.882 --> 44:32.083
- Our relationship...
- Relationship?

44:32.084 --> 44:33.918
There you are.

44:33.919 --> 44:38.587
Do you think you know
everything about sex?

44:42.193 --> 44:46.663
The secret ingredient
to sex... is love.

44:52.837 --> 44:57.108
For me, love was just
lust with jealousy added.

44:57.109 --> 45:00.311
Everything else was total nonsense.

45:00.312 --> 45:04.982
For every hundred crimes
committed in the name of love,

45:04.983 --> 45:08.285
only one is committed
in the name of sex.

45:09.086 --> 45:10.388
That's quite a statement.

45:10.389 --> 45:13.224
Well, it all strengthened my wish

45:13.225 --> 45:15.458
for a serious education.

45:27.939 --> 45:29.638
Glasgow.

45:33.244 --> 45:34.743
Aberdeen.

45:36.480 --> 45:38.115
<i>Why are you smiling?</i>

45:38.116 --> 45:41.986
Oh, I just pictured
how an education

45:41.987 --> 45:44.321
would be conveyed in
your storytelling.

45:45.289 --> 45:47.225
Well, that's nothing
to smile about.

45:47.226 --> 45:49.726
I understand that.

45:51.295 --> 45:53.965
So what kind of
education did you get?

45:53.966 --> 45:57.602
I began studying
medicine like my father.

45:57.603 --> 46:01.072
<i>But it was harder and harder
for me to concentrate,</i>

46:01.073 --> 46:05.709
<i>so I studied less and less
till finally I dropped out.</i>

46:07.478 --> 46:10.412
So instead I began
to look for a job.

46:12.617 --> 46:14.919
<i>It turned out it was
hard to get a job</i>

46:14.920 --> 46:17.419
<i>that paid even halfway decently.</i>

46:18.923 --> 46:21.092
<i>I didn't really know
how to do anything,</i>

46:21.093 --> 46:23.628
<i>so I didn't have high hopes</i>

46:23.629 --> 46:25.263
<i>when I applied for a position</i>

46:25.264 --> 46:27.665
<i>as an assistant at
a printing house.</i>

46:27.666 --> 46:31.269
So could you tell me
a little bit more

46:31.270 --> 46:33.971
<i>about your background?</i>

46:33.972 --> 46:38.241
- Um...
- <i>Education-wise.</i>

46:38.242 --> 46:41.345
Oh. Well, I finished high school

46:41.346 --> 46:45.215
and decided to study medicine...

46:45.983 --> 46:48.219
But I didn't finish.

46:48.220 --> 46:50.988
<i>I know it sounds a bit
pointless coming here.</i>

46:50.989 --> 46:53.424
- Right.
- <i>I just really need a job</i>

46:53.425 --> 46:55.459
and I've tried everywhere.

46:55.460 --> 46:57.461
<i>I don't usually give jobs to people</i>

46:57.462 --> 46:59.430
just because they need one.

46:59.431 --> 47:03.334
What about secretarial skills?

47:03.335 --> 47:08.072
- Do you have any of those?
- No, I didn't think you needed skills.

47:08.073 --> 47:11.142
You didn't think you needed skills

47:11.143 --> 47:13.643
for this position as a secretary?

47:13.644 --> 47:15.313
No.

47:15.314 --> 47:16.948
<i>Can you open an envelope?</i>

47:16.949 --> 47:20.650
Yeah, I... yes, I think
I can open an envelope.

47:20.651 --> 47:23.253
<i>Well, I'm glad to hear that.</i>

47:24.222 --> 47:26.289
I shall discuss this conversation

47:26.290 --> 47:29.291
with Mr. Jerome, my boss.

47:31.062 --> 47:34.664
<i>Do you think there's a chance?</i>

47:34.665 --> 47:36.400
I doubt it.

47:36.401 --> 47:38.535
Oh.

47:57.555 --> 48:00.223
Well, apparently

48:00.224 --> 48:02.760
having absolutely no experience

48:02.761 --> 48:04.996
is absolutely fine for this job.

48:04.997 --> 48:07.164
You've got it.

48:07.166 --> 48:09.599
Oh.

48:09.600 --> 48:12.136
Does that mean
I should start tomorrow?

48:12.137 --> 48:14.571
Yeah, I suppose it does.

48:16.140 --> 48:17.507
<i>Good morning.</i>

48:17.508 --> 48:18.907
<i>Right.</i>

48:26.451 --> 48:28.285
Yes?

48:31.254 --> 48:33.024
- Good morning, sir.
- <i>Good morning.</i>

48:33.025 --> 48:34.392
I just wanted to introduce you

48:34.393 --> 48:36.259
<i>to our new junior secretary. Joe?</i>

48:36.260 --> 48:38.261
<i>I believe you wanted to
explain her work duties.</i>

48:38.262 --> 48:40.131
- Hi.
- This is the new junior secretary, sir.

48:40.132 --> 48:41.465
<i>Liz, can I have another coffee?</i>

48:41.466 --> 48:43.667
- Yes, of course, sir.
- Thank you.

48:46.304 --> 48:47.804
Hi.

48:51.309 --> 48:52.809
Jerome?

48:52.810 --> 48:55.412
<i>Your first love.</i>

49:00.283 --> 49:02.787
I bet you didn't think I'd make
something of myself, right?

49:02.788 --> 49:04.789
And now here I sit,

49:04.790 --> 49:08.023
the director's chair of M&J Morris Ltd.

49:11.062 --> 49:12.597
Yes, quite surprising.

49:12.598 --> 49:14.232
Surprising?

49:14.233 --> 49:16.333
It's a sign from God.

49:20.504 --> 49:22.806
You know, I've thought about
you often since then.

49:24.375 --> 49:25.941
<i>Have you thought of me?</i>

49:28.646 --> 49:31.382
- Well...
- <i>Ah.</i>

49:31.383 --> 49:33.718
Usually, you know,
my uncle sits here.

49:33.719 --> 49:34.240
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

49:34.243 --> 49:36.219
But he's developed a
bit of a tummy problem,

49:36.220 --> 49:38.089
so he's at the spa,
taking long baths,

49:38.090 --> 49:39.789
drinking lots of water. Poor guy.

49:39.790 --> 49:41.626
<i>And no one knows for how long,</i>

49:41.627 --> 49:44.762
so now I'm the J in M&J Morris Ltd.

49:44.763 --> 49:46.831
How about that?

49:46.832 --> 49:50.568
<i>We print cards and envelopes
and nonsense like that.</i>

49:50.569 --> 49:52.502
It's a bloody complicated
business, you know.

49:52.503 --> 49:54.037
I don't understand a word of it.

49:55.338 --> 49:57.842
Come on, I'll show you around. Yes?

49:57.843 --> 49:59.544
- Liz?
- Yes sir?

49:59.545 --> 50:01.777
Oh, look, there you are. Good job.

50:01.778 --> 50:04.247
Every time you do a good job,
I say, "good job, Liz."

50:04.248 --> 50:05.783
- Thank you, sir.
- What's her name?

50:05.784 --> 50:07.652
- Liz.
- "Good job, Liz."

50:07.653 --> 50:09.819
- Good job, Liz.
- Good job, Liz!

50:09.820 --> 50:12.155
This is Bobby. Bobby,
say hello. This is Joe.

50:12.156 --> 50:14.890
<i>- Hello.</i>
- He does the business cards.

50:28.674 --> 50:30.141
It stopped.

50:30.142 --> 50:32.175
Fuck.

50:35.278 --> 50:36.613
Yes.

50:37.914 --> 50:39.617
Well, isn't there an alarm?

50:39.618 --> 50:41.319
To which?

50:41.320 --> 50:44.155
- Isn't there an alarm?
- Alarm, all right, yes.

50:44.156 --> 50:47.524
- Good thinking.
- I'll press this.

50:49.859 --> 50:51.761
Imagine...

50:51.762 --> 50:54.465
You look just as great
all these years later.

50:54.466 --> 50:56.433
Oh no.

51:00.403 --> 51:01.806
No.

51:01.807 --> 51:03.440
<i>No?</i>

51:04.642 --> 51:06.611
- Wha...?
- No, Jerome, this won't work.

51:06.612 --> 51:09.646
- Which won't work?
- This.

51:11.781 --> 51:13.215
Why not?

51:14.185 --> 51:15.884
You're not really my type.

51:17.887 --> 51:19.789
That's how it's gonna be?

51:19.790 --> 51:22.625
- <i>Yes.</i>
- All right.

51:28.833 --> 51:30.467
Fuck's sake.

51:39.809 --> 51:41.678
Okay.

51:51.222 --> 51:53.756
<i>- Umm...</i>
- Give me your hand.

51:54.859 --> 51:56.992
In a fireman's grip.

51:57.727 --> 51:58.795
Ooh!

51:58.796 --> 52:00.562
- You okay?
- Yeah.

52:02.767 --> 52:05.567
Why didn't you have sex with him?

52:06.337 --> 52:07.672
I'm not quite sure.

52:07.673 --> 52:10.308
I've shagged lots of idiots.

52:10.309 --> 52:12.677
I suppose he fired you then.

52:12.678 --> 52:14.779
No. If he had fired me,

52:14.780 --> 52:16.578
then he would've lost.

52:19.849 --> 52:23.421
<i>As I didn't recall anyone
having defined my work duties,</i>

52:23.422 --> 52:27.289
<i>I decided to clean up in
order to smooth the waters.</i>

52:34.899 --> 52:37.467
<i>- Good morning, sir.</i>
- Any calls?

52:37.468 --> 52:38.968
No sir.

52:44.874 --> 52:46.208
What have you done?

52:47.278 --> 52:48.945
Oh. I cleaned up.

52:48.946 --> 52:50.480
You cleaned up?

52:50.481 --> 52:52.949
It... it was quite messy and...

52:52.950 --> 52:54.618
- Liz?
- Yes sir?

52:54.619 --> 52:56.586
She cleaned up.

52:56.587 --> 52:59.522
I know... I didn't know, sir.

52:59.523 --> 53:02.025
- I was away from my desk.
- Are you completely mad?

53:08.431 --> 53:10.533
What is the tea and
pastry doing here?

53:10.535 --> 53:12.636
I thought that's what you
wanted for breakfast.

53:12.637 --> 53:14.004
<i>You thought? Mmm!</i>

53:14.005 --> 53:15.438
You're not supposed to think.

53:15.439 --> 53:16.741
I don't pay you to think, do I?

53:16.742 --> 53:17.908
This is a do-over.

53:17.909 --> 53:19.643
<i>- A do-over?</i>
<i>- Right.</i>

53:19.644 --> 53:21.811
Pick it up, take it outside

53:21.812 --> 53:23.580
and do it again.

53:34.592 --> 53:37.259
One moment.

53:45.603 --> 53:47.903
Come in.

53:50.040 --> 53:52.443
Would now be a good time
for some tea and cake?

53:52.444 --> 53:54.143
Sure, why not.

53:55.980 --> 53:57.847
Where the fuck is my cake fork?

53:57.848 --> 53:59.015
<i>Cake fork?</i>

53:59.016 --> 54:00.718
- <i>Right.</i>
- Well...

54:00.719 --> 54:02.353
I would've got you one,

54:02.354 --> 54:04.821
but it just... Feels inappropriate.

54:22.072 --> 54:24.375
Unmanly.

54:24.376 --> 54:25.675
Feminine.

54:25.676 --> 54:27.611
On the other hand,

54:27.612 --> 54:29.647
you must say that a cake fork is...

54:29.648 --> 54:32.015
Is a rather practical tool.

54:33.551 --> 54:37.388
It's like a cross between
a knife and a fork.

54:37.389 --> 54:39.457
<i>The point is that you're supposed</i>

54:39.458 --> 54:41.091
<i>to be able to hold the
cake dish with one hand,</i>

54:41.092 --> 54:43.258
then cut it with the other...

54:44.060 --> 54:47.665
And then eat it with the fork.

54:47.666 --> 54:50.366
- It's not feminine.
- It's at least bourgeois.

54:51.501 --> 54:53.938
It's said that the...
The Bolsheviks

54:53.939 --> 54:55.940
<i>during their rampage
through Russia,</i>

54:55.941 --> 54:57.741
<i>to separate the men from the boys,</i>

54:57.742 --> 55:00.778
<i>or rather the bourgeoisie
from the proletariat,</i>

55:00.779 --> 55:02.178
<i>they brought a boy,</i>

55:02.179 --> 55:03.880
<i>and before burning down a house</i>

55:03.881 --> 55:07.684
<i>they sent him in to make
sure they had cake forks.</i>

55:11.789 --> 55:13.956
That's not true.

55:17.093 --> 55:19.663
I don't have the story first-hand.

55:19.664 --> 55:23.166
<i>- Hello.</i>
<i>- Hi.</i>

55:23.167 --> 55:26.437
Hi, I was wondering
if you could help me.

55:26.438 --> 55:28.705
It's suddenly gone very dirty.

55:30.740 --> 55:33.577
See, you put your dirty
fingers on there.

55:33.578 --> 55:35.545
Maybe we should wash your hands.

55:35.546 --> 55:37.313
Yeah, better.

55:39.182 --> 55:40.817
Mm-hmm.

55:40.818 --> 55:42.852
You must be very talented.

55:42.853 --> 55:44.987
- Yeah sure.
- Mmm.

55:52.929 --> 55:55.131
<i>If you had asked Jerome,
he would've said</i>

55:55.132 --> 55:57.433
<i>that I was the one who
had declared war.</i>

55:59.569 --> 56:01.739
<i>Many times he'd take me into town,</i>

56:01.740 --> 56:04.608
<i>just so I could hold his coat.</i>

56:04.609 --> 56:06.576
- There.
<i>- Where?</i>

56:06.577 --> 56:09.244
There, behind the green car.

56:11.181 --> 56:12.616
It's not big enough.

56:12.617 --> 56:14.618
<i>It is, there's plenty of space.</i>

56:14.619 --> 56:16.686
<i>I saw it.</i>

56:16.687 --> 56:18.154
It's not enough space.

56:18.155 --> 56:20.456
<i>I'm telling you there's
plenty of space.</i>

56:27.031 --> 56:28.397
No.

56:32.235 --> 56:34.104
Can I try?

56:34.105 --> 56:36.941
<i>Can you try?</i>

56:36.942 --> 56:38.808
<i>I'm a wizard at this.</i>

56:38.809 --> 56:40.543
I just tried it. There's
not enough space, Joe.

56:40.545 --> 56:42.680
You just saw me do it.
There's not enough space.

56:42.681 --> 56:43.880
Okay?

56:43.881 --> 56:46.849
- Can I try?
- You wanna try?

56:49.085 --> 56:51.020
Why not?

57:37.667 --> 57:39.869
<i>It was about this time</i>

57:39.871 --> 57:44.039
<i>that a dramatic change
happened inside of me.</i>

57:45.675 --> 57:47.645
<i>I could suddenly see</i>

57:47.646 --> 57:50.780
<i>a kind of order in the mess.</i>

57:50.781 --> 57:53.349
It was all very very wrong.

57:54.584 --> 57:57.153
I wanted to be one
of Jerome's things.

57:57.154 --> 58:00.024
I wanted to be picked up

58:00.025 --> 58:03.661
and put down again and again.

58:03.662 --> 58:06.096
<i>I wanted to be treated
by his hands,</i>

58:06.097 --> 58:09.633
according to some
sophisticated principle

58:09.634 --> 58:12.235
that I didn't understand.

58:12.236 --> 58:14.004
His strong hands?

58:14.005 --> 58:15.906
Yes, but now it was

58:15.907 --> 58:17.941
no longer just about his hands.

58:17.942 --> 58:21.344
It was as if everything
about him was different,

58:21.345 --> 58:23.847
<i>which of course it wasn't,</i>

58:23.848 --> 58:25.382
<i>and I knew that in my head.</i>

58:25.383 --> 58:27.651
And I scolded myself for seeing him

58:27.652 --> 58:29.318
in this new light.

58:30.054 --> 58:31.988
Love is blind.

58:31.989 --> 58:34.323
No no no, it's worse.

58:35.091 --> 58:37.627
Love distorts things.

58:37.628 --> 58:40.630
Or even worse, love is something

58:40.631 --> 58:42.898
you've never asked for.

58:43.900 --> 58:45.735
The erotic was
something I asked for

58:45.736 --> 58:48.004
or even demanded of men.

58:48.005 --> 58:50.973
But this idiotic love...

58:52.375 --> 58:54.910
I felt humiliated by it...

58:55.912 --> 58:58.547
And all the dishonesty
that follows.

59:00.750 --> 59:03.352
The erotic is about saying yes.

59:04.988 --> 59:07.891
Love appeals to the
lowest instincts,

59:07.892 --> 59:10.226
wrapped up in lies.

59:10.228 --> 59:11.928
How do you say yes

59:11.929 --> 59:15.130
when you mean no and vice versa?

59:18.368 --> 59:21.238
I'm ashamed of what I became,

59:21.239 --> 59:24.073
but it was beyond my control.

59:26.009 --> 59:28.143
You know what you're doing now?

59:28.912 --> 59:30.748
No, what am I doing?

59:30.749 --> 59:33.416
You're defending your personality.

59:33.417 --> 59:36.619
I thought the point
was to reveal it.

59:42.826 --> 59:45.996
<i>At this time I took
up walking again.</i>

59:45.997 --> 59:48.030
<i>I walked in the forest.</i>

59:52.302 --> 59:55.004
<i>The forest of my childhood.</i>

59:56.140 --> 01:00:00.042
<i>I took the same walk
again and again.</i>

01:00:01.077 --> 01:00:04.014
<i>Right turn after the gatehouse,</i>

01:00:04.015 --> 01:00:06.850
<i>and right again by the ash tree,</i>

01:00:06.851 --> 01:00:09.752
<i>which has the most beautiful
leaves in the forest.</i>

01:00:11.221 --> 01:00:14.925
<i>And further on past the
lady with her poodle</i>

01:00:14.926 --> 01:00:17.625
<i>and the old man on the bench.</i>

01:00:24.434 --> 01:00:26.436
<i>I couldn't free myself</i>

01:00:26.437 --> 01:00:30.406
<i>of the image of Jerome and
his careless elegance.</i>

01:00:37.747 --> 01:00:40.750
<i>And during this time, when
I was with other men,</i>

01:00:40.751 --> 01:00:44.687
<i>I forbade them to touch
my body with their hands.</i>

01:00:47.491 --> 01:00:52.027
<i>And soon I stopped
having sex altogether.</i>

01:00:53.496 --> 01:00:56.766
<i>I tried to meet him all the time.</i>

01:00:56.767 --> 01:00:59.469
<i>I found out where he lived,</i>

01:00:59.470 --> 01:01:02.638
<i>but of course never dared
ring his doorbell.</i>

01:01:05.542 --> 01:01:07.944
<i>I worked for a long
time on a letter</i>

01:01:07.945 --> 01:01:11.480
<i>in which I told him about
my feelings for him.</i>

01:01:12.282 --> 01:01:13.883
<i>A month would pass</i>

01:01:13.885 --> 01:01:16.019
<i>before I had built
up enough courage</i>

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:18.420
<i>to deliver it.</i>

01:01:26.997 --> 01:01:31.400
I'm sorry. Isn't this
Jerome's office?

01:01:32.802 --> 01:01:35.438
I'm happy to say that
this never has been

01:01:35.439 --> 01:01:37.941
and never will be Jerome's office.

01:01:37.942 --> 01:01:42.545
But my nephew has been standing
in for me while I've been unwell.

01:01:42.547 --> 01:01:46.282
Was that a letter for him?

01:01:47.050 --> 01:01:48.518
- Yes.
- <i>Give it to me</i>

01:01:48.519 --> 01:01:51.553
and I will make sure he gets it.

01:01:55.325 --> 01:01:57.594
I can't promise when that might be,

01:01:57.595 --> 01:02:00.430
as he's long gone.

01:02:00.431 --> 01:02:02.365
<i>How the young finance</i>

01:02:02.366 --> 01:02:05.101
their irrepressible
desire for travel

01:02:05.102 --> 01:02:06.970
is a mystery to me.

01:02:06.971 --> 01:02:08.872
So he's gone?

01:02:08.873 --> 01:02:10.706
Deserted us, yes.

01:02:11.841 --> 01:02:14.175
Raving about a trip
around the world

01:02:14.176 --> 01:02:16.513
- and married and all.
- Married?

01:02:16.514 --> 01:02:18.348
<i>Married, yes.</i>

01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:21.817
<i>Flown the coop with my secretary.</i>

01:02:22.886 --> 01:02:24.353
Liz.

01:02:31.294 --> 01:02:33.296
And your job?

01:02:33.297 --> 01:02:37.000
It turned out that
Jerome's uncle demanded

01:02:37.001 --> 01:02:39.369
a bit more knowledge about
the business, so...

01:02:39.370 --> 01:02:41.769
That was the end of love then?

01:02:43.473 --> 01:02:46.543
Well, maybe it's not
quite as simple.

01:02:46.544 --> 01:02:50.880
<i>But more about that later,</i>

01:02:50.882 --> 01:02:52.882
as they say in the novels.

01:02:52.884 --> 01:02:56.253
And Jerome just disappeared?

01:02:56.254 --> 01:02:59.256
Yes, though I tried to keep him,

01:02:59.257 --> 01:03:01.992
in my own way, mentally,

01:03:01.993 --> 01:03:05.894
as I masturbated on the
train amongst other people.

01:03:07.664 --> 01:03:09.633
You masturbated on the train?

01:03:09.634 --> 01:03:11.867
- On the seat?
- Yes, of course.

01:03:17.239 --> 01:03:20.043
<i>I did a jigsaw puzzle.</i>

01:03:20.044 --> 01:03:21.577
<i>A jigsaw puzzle?</i>

01:03:26.149 --> 01:03:28.919
<i>I found details in
the other passengers</i>

01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:31.687
<i>that reminded me of Jerome.</i>

01:04:11.728 --> 01:04:14.064
<i>But in the long run,</i>

01:04:14.065 --> 01:04:16.333
<i>I couldn't hold on to
the details of him,</i>

01:04:16.334 --> 01:04:18.567
<i>no matter how hard I tried.</i>

01:04:19.636 --> 01:04:21.404
Maybe that's how it is with memory.

01:04:21.405 --> 01:04:24.641
You... you remember silhouettes,

01:04:24.642 --> 01:04:26.675
the essentials.

01:04:26.676 --> 01:04:30.379
But that's not
necessarily a bad thing.

01:04:32.516 --> 01:04:34.751
<i>Of course, as silhouettes
in the winter,</i>

01:04:34.752 --> 01:04:38.555
- <i>the trees are difficult to tell apart.</i>
- See these buds?

01:04:38.556 --> 01:04:40.757
<i>My father wrestled courageously</i>

01:04:40.758 --> 01:04:43.591
<i>with his flora and
tree type guides.</i>

01:04:45.562 --> 01:04:47.262
It's actually...

01:04:48.597 --> 01:04:52.769
The souls of the trees
we see in the winter.

01:04:52.770 --> 01:04:55.305
In the summer, everything
is green and idyllic,

01:04:55.306 --> 01:04:57.140
but in the winter,

01:04:57.141 --> 01:05:00.143
the branches and the trunks,
they all stand out.

01:05:00.144 --> 01:05:01.976
Just look at how
crooked they all are.

01:05:03.994 --> 01:05:05.714
<i>The branches have to
carry all of the leaves</i>

01:05:05.715 --> 01:05:07.416
<i>into the sunlight.</i>

01:05:08.585 --> 01:05:11.520
<i>It's one long struggle
for survival.</i>

01:05:14.723 --> 01:05:16.593
<i>My father surprised me</i>

01:05:16.594 --> 01:05:20.463
<i>by calling the naked trunks
the souls of the trees.</i>

01:05:20.464 --> 01:05:23.233
<i>A poetic thought that
was rare for him,</i>

01:05:23.234 --> 01:05:25.335
<i>as by his own account</i>

01:05:25.336 --> 01:05:27.935
<i>he preferred the
empirical sciences.</i>

01:05:31.141 --> 01:05:33.310
<i>And after Jerome?</i>

01:05:33.311 --> 01:05:35.711
I reacted...

01:05:36.613 --> 01:05:38.415
Well, let's just say,

01:05:38.416 --> 01:05:40.250
aggressively.

01:05:40.251 --> 01:05:42.318
How?

01:05:43.253 --> 01:05:46.587
By intensifying my hunt for men.

01:05:48.358 --> 01:05:50.327
<i>You know these supermarket doors</i>

01:05:50.328 --> 01:05:53.797
<i>that open and close by way
of some kind of sensor?</i>

01:05:53.798 --> 01:05:56.832
<i>Now compare these doors to my cunt</i>

01:05:56.833 --> 01:06:00.935
<i>and add an extraordinarily
sensitive sensor.</i>

01:06:02.706 --> 01:06:05.075
<i>My sensitive door opening</i>

01:06:05.076 --> 01:06:07.309
<i>gave me an opportunity to develop</i>

01:06:07.310 --> 01:06:09.246
<i>my morphological studies</i>

01:06:09.247 --> 01:06:11.579
<i>from leaves to genitals.</i>

01:06:16.418 --> 01:06:18.687
<i>I embarked on a trip through</i>

01:06:18.688 --> 01:06:21.223
<i>what, in the lingo
of children's books,</i>

01:06:21.224 --> 01:06:25.526
<i>one might call the country
of the big black cocks...</i>

01:06:27.764 --> 01:06:30.300
<i>The country of the
small yellow cocks</i>

01:06:30.301 --> 01:06:32.402
<i>and so on.</i>

01:06:32.403 --> 01:06:34.471
<i>And most of all, I battled my way</i>

01:06:34.472 --> 01:06:37.605
<i>through an untold number
of circumcised cocks.</i>

01:06:39.843 --> 01:06:42.344
<i>By the way, did you know
that if you combine</i>

01:06:42.345 --> 01:06:44.848
<i>all the foreskin cut
off through history</i>

01:06:44.849 --> 01:06:48.050
<i>it would reach to
Mars and back again?</i>

01:07:08.204 --> 01:07:10.072
<i>Mrs. H.</i>

01:07:25.155 --> 01:07:28.325
<i>By now I had built up a
sizeable circle of men...</i>

01:07:28.326 --> 01:07:30.659
<i>And was starting to have trouble</i>

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:33.929
- <i>...remembering who was who.</i>
- <i>Hello, sweetheart. Want to meet?</i>

01:07:33.930 --> 01:07:35.864
<i>It's fisher.</i>

01:07:35.865 --> 01:07:38.934
<i>I'm lying here, thinking
of you and what you said.</i>

01:07:38.935 --> 01:07:40.936
<i>I'm not angry at all if
that's what you think.</i>

01:07:40.937 --> 01:07:43.607
<i>Hi, Joe, it's rob again.</i>

01:07:43.608 --> 01:07:45.542
<i>I had a really good
time seeing you.</i>

01:07:45.543 --> 01:07:47.611
- Give me...
- ...Give me a call.

01:07:47.612 --> 01:07:50.747
<i>Hi, Joe, I left a
couple of messages.</i>

01:07:50.748 --> 01:07:53.315
- <i>Is everything all right?
- I quickly gave up</i>

01:07:53.316 --> 01:07:56.453
<i>trying to remember the
individual relationships.</i>

01:07:56.454 --> 01:07:58.887
<i>It was impossible,</i>

01:07:58.888 --> 01:08:02.523
<i>and impossible to predict
what they wanted to hear.</i>

01:08:03.425 --> 01:08:05.960
<i>So I invented a method.</i>

01:08:09.199 --> 01:08:11.667
<i>It was all based on chance.</i>

01:08:14.639 --> 01:08:18.207
<i>A one meant an overly
loving answer.</i>

01:08:21.243 --> 01:08:24.979
<i>A two, not quite as passionate
but still positive.</i>

01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:26.783
<i>And so on up to five,</i>

01:08:26.783 --> 01:08:28.652
<i>which was a complete rejection.</i>

01:08:28.653 --> 01:08:31.520
<i>And six, no answer at all.</i>

01:08:40.630 --> 01:08:42.363
Hey, Eddie, it's me.

01:08:42.365 --> 01:08:44.366
Listen, I've given
it a lot of thought

01:08:44.367 --> 01:08:47.269
and I've come to the
conclusion that we're done.

01:08:47.270 --> 01:08:48.837
Bye.

01:08:48.837 --> 01:08:50.506
<i>The trick with this method</i>

01:08:50.508 --> 01:08:52.341
<i>was that I didn't have to worry</i>

01:08:52.343 --> 01:08:54.243
<i>about the individual
relationships...</i>

01:08:54.245 --> 01:08:56.745
Hi, Patrick, it's Joe.

01:08:56.746 --> 01:08:59.416
<i>but instead became
completely unpredictable,</i>

01:08:59.417 --> 01:09:02.718
<i>which of course drove
the men even wilder.</i>

01:09:03.752 --> 01:09:05.487
You're quite annoying,

01:09:05.488 --> 01:09:08.358
so I don't want to see you anymore.

01:09:08.359 --> 01:09:09.925
Please don't call back.

01:09:09.926 --> 01:09:12.861
<i>That sounds rather stressful.</i>

01:09:12.862 --> 01:09:14.997
<i>Yes, actually it was.</i>

01:09:14.999 --> 01:09:18.901
<i>But fortunately I had my
little book of comfort.</i>

01:09:20.703 --> 01:09:23.305
<i>When I needed comfort or peace,</i>

01:09:23.305 --> 01:09:25.642
<i>I took out my herbarium</i>

01:09:25.643 --> 01:09:28.444
<i>and looked at my favorite leaves...</i>

01:09:28.446 --> 01:09:33.180
<i>Ash, trembling Aspen and Lime.</i>

01:09:40.622 --> 01:09:44.326
<i>When you're dealing with a larger
group of lovers, as I was,</i>

01:09:44.327 --> 01:09:46.462
<i>there will typically
be a difference</i>

01:09:46.464 --> 01:09:48.031
<i>in their qualities.</i>

01:09:48.032 --> 01:09:50.798
<i>H was a sticky bastard.</i>

01:09:52.533 --> 01:09:54.771
You have to leave. I've
got guests for dinner.

01:09:54.772 --> 01:09:56.838
But he's not coming until 7:00.

01:09:57.606 --> 01:09:59.309
No.

01:09:59.310 --> 01:10:01.143
But 7:00 isn't that far away.

01:10:08.752 --> 01:10:10.752
Do you love me?

01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:16.426
<i>A was to arrive at 7:00,</i>

01:10:16.427 --> 01:10:18.860
<i>and I needed to get H out of there.</i>

01:10:21.563 --> 01:10:23.631
I love you too much.

01:10:24.868 --> 01:10:27.736
You keep promising,
but I understand now

01:10:27.737 --> 01:10:31.974
that you'll never leave
your family for my sake.

01:10:33.575 --> 01:10:35.611
It's sad, but...

01:10:37.112 --> 01:10:38.880
It's your choice.

01:10:39.983 --> 01:10:41.650
<i>It's not satisfying for me</i>

01:10:41.651 --> 01:10:44.720
that I can't have you completely.

01:10:46.990 --> 01:10:50.359
Which is why we can't see
each other any longer.

01:10:54.431 --> 01:10:56.198
Goodbye.

01:10:59.935 --> 01:11:02.070
Look, I...

01:11:06.376 --> 01:11:08.744
And have a nice life.

01:11:09.846 --> 01:11:11.847
Oh. Ugh. Wow.

01:11:34.037 --> 01:11:37.171
My darling, I'm yours.

01:11:38.141 --> 01:11:40.108
I've left her.

01:11:47.716 --> 01:11:50.419
<i>- Has he gone inside?
- Yes.</i>

01:11:52.021 --> 01:11:54.022
<i>Is the door closed?</i>

01:12:06.135 --> 01:12:08.438
- <i>Uh, hello.</i>
- Hello.

01:12:08.439 --> 01:12:09.538
<i>Apologize.</i>

01:12:09.539 --> 01:12:13.941
We... had promised not to come up.

01:12:15.144 --> 01:12:17.846
<i>We just wanted to make sure</i>

01:12:17.847 --> 01:12:22.150
he got here safely, now that
he's made the big decision.

01:12:23.453 --> 01:12:27.121
<i>May the children see him inside?</i>

01:12:43.473 --> 01:12:45.173
What a nice place.

01:12:46.575 --> 01:12:49.911
It's... so bohemian.

01:12:53.582 --> 01:12:55.919
Oh, that's right.

01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:58.721
- You need the car key.
- Uh, no, I don't need the car.

01:12:58.722 --> 01:13:00.489
Oh yes, you do.

01:13:00.490 --> 01:13:02.524
He likes the car.

01:13:02.525 --> 01:13:04.058
Here.

01:13:05.562 --> 01:13:07.564
- No, please. Just take it.
- I don't want it.

01:13:07.565 --> 01:13:09.605
- Just take it.
- I don't want the fucking car!

01:13:13.802 --> 01:13:15.038
<i>It's all right.</i>

01:13:15.039 --> 01:13:17.574
We'll get the bus home.

01:13:17.575 --> 01:13:21.543
The children might as well get used
to public transport now, right?

01:13:21.544 --> 01:13:24.847
<i>Of course, their standard of living</i>

01:13:24.848 --> 01:13:26.515
<i>won't be the same anymore, but...</i>

01:13:30.819 --> 01:13:35.224
Hey. What's this?

01:13:35.225 --> 01:13:37.860
It's a present.

01:13:37.861 --> 01:13:41.496
A pillow he has
embroidered himself.

01:13:42.931 --> 01:13:45.099
<i>- And who's it for?</i>
- Daddy.

01:13:47.170 --> 01:13:49.638
I do hope it's all right
if the children call

01:13:49.639 --> 01:13:50.974
their father "daddy" here.

01:13:50.975 --> 01:13:52.075
If you prefer,

01:13:52.076 --> 01:13:55.612
they can call him "him"

01:13:55.613 --> 01:13:58.881
or simply "the man."

01:13:58.882 --> 01:14:01.618
To be honest, my first
thought was never ever

01:14:01.619 --> 01:14:03.552
to let either of you
see the children,

01:14:03.553 --> 01:14:05.654
but then I changed my mind.

01:14:05.655 --> 01:14:08.557
I thought it only right that
their father be confronted

01:14:08.558 --> 01:14:11.259
by the little people whose
lives he has destroyed.

01:14:12.095 --> 01:14:14.896
Give daddy your present.

01:14:18.567 --> 01:14:21.770
<i>It's a car the little
dear has embroidered.</i>

01:14:21.771 --> 01:14:25.174
I'm aware that not
everyone can see it,

01:14:25.175 --> 01:14:28.711
but with the heart
one can see much,

01:14:28.712 --> 01:14:32.313
however unimportant that
information may be to you.

01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:35.784
Would it be all right

01:14:35.785 --> 01:14:38.755
if I showed the children
the whoring bed?

01:14:38.756 --> 01:14:43.225
After all, they also have
a stake in this event.

01:14:47.162 --> 01:14:49.331
<i>You need to see it, right?</i>

01:14:49.332 --> 01:14:52.533
<i>Let's go see daddy's
favorite place.</i>

01:14:53.702 --> 01:14:55.570
Come on, boys.

01:14:56.872 --> 01:14:58.874
Oh...!

01:15:02.046 --> 01:15:05.480
So this is where it all happened.

01:15:11.287 --> 01:15:14.623
You should try to
memorize this room,

01:15:14.624 --> 01:15:16.825
especially the bed.

01:15:16.826 --> 01:15:20.896
It'll stand you in good
stead later in therapy.

01:15:22.265 --> 01:15:24.933
<i>Here I sit, rambling
on about therapy</i>

01:15:24.935 --> 01:15:27.136
<i>without a thought of
what it might cost.</i>

01:15:27.137 --> 01:15:30.104
I do hope you don't think
we're here to beg.

01:15:33.275 --> 01:15:36.412
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:36.413 --> 01:15:40.381
I'm being silly.
Mommy's being silly.

01:15:41.116 --> 01:15:43.426
Let's have a cup of tea.

01:16:00.903 --> 01:16:02.371
The children's father likes

01:16:02.372 --> 01:16:04.672
two lumps of sugar in his tea.

01:16:20.990 --> 01:16:24.127
<i>Mmm!</i>

01:16:24.128 --> 01:16:25.861
I'll get it. <i>Hm-mmm.</i>

01:16:25.862 --> 01:16:27.703
- No no no, please please please.
- <i>Hm-mmm.</i>

01:16:29.398 --> 01:16:31.332
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:16:32.067 --> 01:16:33.969
- Yes?
- Uh...

01:16:33.970 --> 01:16:36.238
Oh, how nice! Lovely.

01:16:36.239 --> 01:16:39.375
- Boys. Come here.
- Is Joe here?

01:16:39.376 --> 01:16:41.442
This might be interesting.

01:16:42.444 --> 01:16:45.114
- Hi. Yes.
- This is my son. Yes.

01:16:45.115 --> 01:16:47.716
- Hello hello.
- Good boy. Look him in the eyes.

01:16:47.717 --> 01:16:48.984
<i>I'm Andy. Hello.</i>

01:16:48.985 --> 01:16:50.452
Friend of Joe's then?

01:16:50.453 --> 01:16:52.155
- Yeah.
- You known each other long?

01:16:52.156 --> 01:16:55.724
- Um, not that long, no.
- Not terribly long?

01:16:55.725 --> 01:16:57.191
- No.
- Oh.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:08.036
<i>A menage a trois.</i>

01:17:09.271 --> 01:17:11.407
It's all so exotic.

01:17:11.408 --> 01:17:14.709
So... broad-minded.

01:17:16.211 --> 01:17:18.146
On that point...

01:17:18.981 --> 01:17:20.749
I failed.

01:17:20.750 --> 01:17:22.784
No doubt about it.

01:17:24.753 --> 01:17:28.490
Boys, now is the time to be alert

01:17:28.491 --> 01:17:33.127
and ask all the questions
your hearts' desire,

01:17:33.896 --> 01:17:35.263
because...

01:17:36.365 --> 01:17:39.868
I hope that you shall
never have to encounter

01:17:39.869 --> 01:17:43.338
such people or be in such
a situation ever again.

01:17:44.306 --> 01:17:46.275
<i>Well? Hmm?</i>

01:17:46.276 --> 01:17:48.343
<i>You don't have any questions?</i>

01:17:49.178 --> 01:17:51.379
No?

01:17:53.248 --> 01:17:54.816
Well, I'll start, shall I?

01:17:56.218 --> 01:17:58.554
Approximately how many lives

01:17:58.555 --> 01:18:01.858
<i>do you think she has time
to destroy in one day?</i>

01:18:01.859 --> 01:18:03.892
<i>Five?</i>

01:18:03.893 --> 01:18:05.493
<i>50?</i>

01:18:06.362 --> 01:18:08.196
<i>Or several hundreds?</i>

01:18:10.833 --> 01:18:14.836
Look, this is just a
big misunderstanding.

01:18:19.808 --> 01:18:21.341
Boys...

01:18:23.245 --> 01:18:27.149
- I don't...
- I don't love your father.

01:18:27.150 --> 01:18:29.485
<i>She's just saying that
to make us feel better.</i>

01:18:29.486 --> 01:18:32.888
I'm sure you understand that.

01:18:32.889 --> 01:18:34.756
Because if it were
a joke, I mean...

01:18:35.591 --> 01:18:38.494
If... this were really a joke,

01:18:38.495 --> 01:18:40.862
then it would be a joke so cruel.

01:18:45.901 --> 01:18:49.671
No one can be that cruel.

01:18:50.939 --> 01:18:53.609
To destroy a mesh of feelings woven

01:18:53.610 --> 01:18:58.312
over 20 years is no joke,
I can assure you.

01:19:07.856 --> 01:19:10.492
Well...

01:19:10.493 --> 01:19:13.862
If three's a crowd,
then seven must be a bit

01:19:13.863 --> 01:19:15.697
of a challenge for the pretty miss.

01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.402
<i>I must say I have a hard time</i>

01:19:20.403 --> 01:19:23.171
<i>picturing her enjoying loneliness.</i>

01:19:25.040 --> 01:19:28.310
I think we'd better grab
the chance to get away,

01:19:28.311 --> 01:19:31.547
before things become grotesque.

01:19:31.548 --> 01:19:33.448
Come on.

01:19:34.283 --> 01:19:37.620
- No, dad!
- No. No. No.

01:19:37.621 --> 01:19:40.122
Come on.

01:19:40.123 --> 01:19:43.558
You wouldn't want to give your father
a guilty conscience now, would you?

01:20:02.478 --> 01:20:04.946
So how did this episode
affect your life?

01:20:06.181 --> 01:20:07.882
Not at all.

01:20:09.485 --> 01:20:12.420
- Not at all?
- No.

01:20:13.621 --> 01:20:16.723
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

01:20:20.963 --> 01:20:22.930
Oh, that's true.

01:20:26.035 --> 01:20:27.502
Some people...

01:20:28.304 --> 01:20:29.637
Blame the addict.

01:20:29.638 --> 01:20:33.442
<i>Other people feel
sorry for the addict.</i>

01:20:33.443 --> 01:20:37.844
But I was an addict out
of lust, not out of need.

01:20:39.281 --> 01:20:41.083
You would say that, wouldn't you?

01:20:41.084 --> 01:20:45.087
And lust that led to
destruction around me...

01:20:45.088 --> 01:20:47.255
Everywhere I went.

01:20:48.624 --> 01:20:53.028
<i>Well, addiction
sometimes leads to an...</i>

01:20:53.029 --> 01:20:54.729
<i>Absence of empathy.</i>

01:20:57.099 --> 01:20:59.134
You can't fight a lion
and blow the noses

01:20:59.135 --> 01:21:01.436
of your children at the same time.

01:21:03.238 --> 01:21:06.506
For me, nymphomania
was callousness.

01:21:10.113 --> 01:21:12.281
<i>You're very stubborn.</i>

01:21:12.282 --> 01:21:14.416
<i>But what about yourself?</i>

01:21:14.417 --> 01:21:17.719
<i>How did you feel during all this?</i>

01:21:27.730 --> 01:21:29.465
Did you feel good

01:21:29.466 --> 01:21:31.466
or did you feel bad?

01:21:38.507 --> 01:21:41.876
Mrs. H was right about
the loneliness.

01:21:42.610 --> 01:21:44.179
I'd be lying if I said

01:21:44.180 --> 01:21:46.079
it hadn't been my
constant companion.

01:21:49.485 --> 01:21:51.453
<i>So you were with all these men</i>

01:21:51.454 --> 01:21:54.055
<i>and you still felt alone?</i>

01:22:00.496 --> 01:22:03.331
I didn't want to
tell you about it...

01:22:04.632 --> 01:22:07.068
<i>But you've led me into a trap.</i>

01:22:10.406 --> 01:22:12.974
It was a certain feeling.

01:22:18.113 --> 01:22:22.316
Oh, how awful that everything
has to be so trivial.

01:22:31.392 --> 01:22:34.530
<i>When I was seven,
I had to have an operation.</i>

01:22:34.531 --> 01:22:38.965
<i>Nothing serious, but it
did require anesthesia.</i>

01:22:40.269 --> 01:22:42.705
<i>I had already been pre-medicated</i>

01:22:42.706 --> 01:22:45.441
<i>and was feeling all right.</i>

01:22:45.442 --> 01:22:49.244
<i>But when I looked into the room
where the doctors and nurses</i>

01:22:49.246 --> 01:22:51.112
<i>were preparing for the operation...</i>

01:22:52.381 --> 01:22:54.817
<i>It was as if I had to pass through</i>

01:22:54.818 --> 01:22:59.052
<i>an impenetrable gate all by myself.</i>

01:23:01.322 --> 01:23:03.659
<i>It wasn't just that
I missed my mom.</i>

01:23:03.660 --> 01:23:06.095
<i>I don't think I missed my dad,</i>

01:23:06.096 --> 01:23:08.061
<i>even though he was the nice one.</i>

01:23:09.365 --> 01:23:11.699
<i>It was as if I was completely alone</i>

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.468
<i>in the universe.</i>

01:23:15.738 --> 01:23:20.375
<i>As if my whole body was filled
with loneliness and tears.</i>

01:23:43.731 --> 01:23:47.034
And I'm still not allowed
to feel sorry for you?

01:23:48.903 --> 01:23:51.038
Shall we go on?

01:23:57.780 --> 01:23:59.882
<i>What are you reading?</i>

01:23:59.883 --> 01:24:02.718
I'm not reading really. I'm just

01:24:02.719 --> 01:24:05.820
reacquainting myself
with Edgar Allan Poe.

01:24:06.555 --> 01:24:07.890
I don't know him.

01:24:07.891 --> 01:24:11.058
No. Well, he was a...

01:24:12.828 --> 01:24:15.430
A very anxiety-ridden man.

01:24:21.203 --> 01:24:24.840
He died in the most fearful
way you can imagine,

01:24:24.841 --> 01:24:28.443
in something called
delirium tremens.

01:24:30.346 --> 01:24:33.716
It occurs when a long
time abuse of alcohol

01:24:33.717 --> 01:24:37.617
is followed by... by
a sudden abstinence.

01:24:39.455 --> 01:24:43.090
And your body goes into some
kind of a hypersensitive shock.

01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:47.528
You can see the most
horrifying hallucinations

01:24:47.529 --> 01:24:51.367
<i>like rats and snakes
and cockroaches</i>

01:24:51.368 --> 01:24:55.902
<i>coming out of the floor and
worms slithering in the walls.</i>

01:24:58.806 --> 01:25:01.744
<i>One's entire nervous
system is on high alert</i>

01:25:01.745 --> 01:25:05.513
and you have a constant
panic and paranoia.

01:25:06.949 --> 01:25:09.983
And then the circulatory
system fails.

01:25:10.718 --> 01:25:12.587
But the panic and horror...

01:25:13.554 --> 01:25:16.491
Remains until the moment of death.

01:25:32.308 --> 01:25:34.941
I know what delirium is.

01:25:38.714 --> 01:25:42.016
<i>"During the whole of a dull,
dark, and soundless day"</i>

01:25:42.017 --> 01:25:44.253
<i>in the autumn of the year,</i>

01:25:44.254 --> 01:25:47.456
<i>when the clouds hung
oppressively low in the heavens,</i>

01:25:47.457 --> 01:25:51.460
<i>I had been passing
alone, on horseback,</i>

01:25:51.461 --> 01:25:54.263
<i>through a singularly
dreary tract of country,</i>

01:25:54.264 --> 01:25:56.899
<i>and at length found myself,</i>

01:25:56.900 --> 01:25:59.500
<i>as the shades of the
evening drew on,</i>

01:25:59.501 --> 01:26:03.638
<i>"within view of the
melancholy House of Usher."</i>

01:26:33.535 --> 01:26:36.002
Hey, dad.

01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:48.648
Hey, luv.

01:26:50.786 --> 01:26:52.719
<i>How are you?</i>

01:26:53.756 --> 01:26:55.523
I fought with mom.

01:26:57.494 --> 01:26:59.926
She's... She's not coming.

01:27:03.998 --> 01:27:06.969
You ought not to fight with her.

01:27:06.970 --> 01:27:09.669
You know Kay's fear of hospitals.

01:27:12.808 --> 01:27:14.909
<i>I know she's not coming.</i>

01:27:14.910 --> 01:27:18.079
We already said everything
we needed to say.

01:27:20.648 --> 01:27:22.949
<i>Kay and I said goodbye at home.</i>

01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:26.253
I don't want her here at all.

01:27:29.425 --> 01:27:31.392
I can't accept that.

01:27:31.393 --> 01:27:34.696
You'll have to.

01:27:34.697 --> 01:27:37.832
She's a cowardly stupid bitch.

01:27:39.033 --> 01:27:41.370
No, she's not.

01:27:41.371 --> 01:27:45.139
- Yes. Yes.
- No, she's not. No, she's not.

01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:47.842
Yes, she is, and you've
never understood that.

01:27:58.020 --> 01:28:01.688
Mmm.

01:28:02.925 --> 01:28:04.692
Doesn't it scare you?

01:28:04.693 --> 01:28:07.894
No.

01:28:10.833 --> 01:28:12.366
No.

01:28:15.603 --> 01:28:17.938
How can you not be afraid?

01:28:22.411 --> 01:28:24.879
I've seen so many die.

01:28:27.081 --> 01:28:29.117
Then there's that...

01:28:29.118 --> 01:28:32.253
Epicurus quote about
not fearing death.

01:28:33.554 --> 01:28:36.456
"When we are, death has not come."

01:28:37.625 --> 01:28:39.760
When death has come...

01:28:40.529 --> 01:28:41.995
"We are not."

01:28:45.901 --> 01:28:48.604
We know what's going to happen.

01:28:48.605 --> 01:28:51.673
I also know all of the drugs
the doctors have to offer.

01:28:51.674 --> 01:28:54.075
So no...

01:28:54.977 --> 01:28:56.144
I am not...

01:28:56.145 --> 01:28:58.845
I am not afraid.

01:29:00.148 --> 01:29:04.051
Hmm. A beautiful girl.

01:29:05.454 --> 01:29:08.155
Beautiful dad.

01:29:29.877 --> 01:29:31.647
K-Kay!

01:29:31.648 --> 01:29:34.882
Daddy, it's okay.

01:29:34.883 --> 01:29:36.316
Kay?

01:29:43.493 --> 01:29:45.359
Daddy.

01:29:49.998 --> 01:29:52.099
Hey.

01:29:55.536 --> 01:29:57.270
It's gonna be okay.

01:30:17.593 --> 01:30:19.193
Don't you want to
take a little walk?

01:30:19.194 --> 01:30:22.664
I'll stay with your
father in the meantime.

01:30:22.665 --> 01:30:24.532
You'll stay?

01:30:24.533 --> 01:30:27.168
- You'll stay here?
- Yes.

01:31:09.777 --> 01:31:12.079
Ash tree leaves.

01:31:14.182 --> 01:31:16.718
<i>Where did you find them?</i>

01:31:16.719 --> 01:31:18.853
They were in the park.

01:31:26.327 --> 01:31:29.930
It truly is the most beautiful
tree in the forest.

01:31:33.769 --> 01:31:35.202
But, dad...

01:31:36.337 --> 01:31:39.072
How do you recognize it in winter?

01:31:40.042 --> 01:31:42.142
<i>I've told you a hundred times.</i>

01:31:43.745 --> 01:31:45.912
But I can't remember.

01:31:50.385 --> 01:31:52.319
<i>When the ash tree was created...</i>

01:31:56.090 --> 01:31:59.260
It made all the other trees
in the forest jealous...

01:32:00.194 --> 01:32:02.429
'Cause it was...

01:32:04.032 --> 01:32:07.167
It was the most beautiful
tree in the forest.

01:32:10.038 --> 01:32:12.139
It had the strongest wood.

01:32:13.241 --> 01:32:18.111
It was the world tree
in norse mythology.

01:32:19.280 --> 01:32:22.382
<i>You couldn't say
anything bad about it.</i>

01:32:26.287 --> 01:32:28.856
<i>And when all the other trees...</i>

01:32:28.857 --> 01:32:31.859
<i>Saw the ash tree with its...</i>

01:32:31.860 --> 01:32:33.928
<i>Black buds...</i>

01:32:34.762 --> 01:32:37.131
They all started laughing.

01:32:37.132 --> 01:32:39.433
"Oh, look...

01:32:40.802 --> 01:32:44.371
The ash tree's had its
fingers in the ashes."

01:33:01.155 --> 01:33:04.359
Dad. Daddy!

01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:08.029
Daddy. Daddy, what's wrong?
Daddy, what's wrong?

01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:10.031
What's wrong?

01:33:10.032 --> 01:33:12.033
Daddy, it's me!

01:33:12.034 --> 01:33:14.201
It's me, daddy. It's me!

01:33:14.969 --> 01:33:17.805
Help! Help!

01:33:17.806 --> 01:33:20.708
- <i>Daddy, it's okay.</i>
- Okay.

01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:22.710
Okay.

01:33:22.711 --> 01:33:25.880
It's okay.

01:33:25.881 --> 01:33:29.249
It's okay. It's all right.

01:33:32.187 --> 01:33:33.620
<i>It's all right.</i>

01:33:44.499 --> 01:33:46.768
<i>We have to fixate him.</i>

01:33:46.769 --> 01:33:48.269
What are you doing?

01:33:48.270 --> 01:33:50.404
<i>What are you doing to me?</i>

01:33:55.177 --> 01:33:58.612
Joe! What are you doing to me?

01:34:08.256 --> 01:34:12.359
<i>Joe! Help! Joe!</i>

01:34:20.401 --> 01:34:22.569
You should take a break.

01:34:23.938 --> 01:34:25.505
Okay.

01:35:26.434 --> 01:35:28.002
<i>Excuse me.</i>

01:35:28.003 --> 01:35:31.705
<i>Can you help me to clean... um...</i>

01:35:32.607 --> 01:35:34.207
Oh.

01:35:35.143 --> 01:35:36.878
Okay, mister... Don't worry.

01:35:36.879 --> 01:35:39.745
Just... I need some help.

01:36:13.348 --> 01:36:16.149
<i>We're going to have
to change the sheets.</i>

01:36:26.127 --> 01:36:27.861
Ready?

01:37:31.059 --> 01:37:32.960
<i>When he died,</i>

01:37:32.962 --> 01:37:36.331
<i>I had no feelings left.</i>

01:37:36.332 --> 01:37:39.000
<i>Well, that's certainly
understandable.</i>

01:37:39.001 --> 01:37:40.635
<i>No.</i>

01:37:40.636 --> 01:37:42.803
<i>I don't know what happened to me.</i>

01:37:43.971 --> 01:37:46.174
<i>It was very shameful.</i>

01:37:46.175 --> 01:37:48.509
<i>Shameful?</i>

01:37:48.510 --> 01:37:50.911
<i>I don't understand.</i>

01:38:16.371 --> 01:38:18.739
<i>I lubricated.</i>

01:38:33.521 --> 01:38:36.057
I know you like to present yourself

01:38:36.058 --> 01:38:39.527
in a negative way and that you
have this kind of dark bias

01:38:39.528 --> 01:38:41.663
that you're worse
than everyone else.

01:38:41.664 --> 01:38:44.563
But this story doesn't
add to that belief.

01:38:46.366 --> 01:38:50.038
It's extremely common to
react sexually in a crisis.

01:38:50.039 --> 01:38:52.173
It may be shameful to you,

01:38:52.174 --> 01:38:56.742
but in literature there's
many worse examples.

01:39:25.305 --> 01:39:27.375
You listen to music, I see?

01:39:27.376 --> 01:39:30.776
Yes. I like it a lot.

01:39:31.546 --> 01:39:33.181
Shall I find a tape?

01:39:33.182 --> 01:39:35.850
No, if there's a tape
already in the machine,

01:39:35.851 --> 01:39:37.166
I'd like to hear that.

01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:39.854
<i>It's something I've been
listening to a lot lately,</i>

01:39:39.855 --> 01:39:44.324
<i>though it's not an entirely
complete recording, unfortunately.</i>

01:39:44.325 --> 01:39:46.828
- What is it?
- It's Bach,

01:39:46.829 --> 01:39:49.695
from his little organ book.

01:39:50.797 --> 01:39:53.999
<i>"Ich ruf zu dir, herr Jesu Christ."</i>

01:39:56.204 --> 01:39:58.740
The theme is originally a hymn,

01:39:58.741 --> 01:40:03.411
but Bach rearranged it and
embellished it a little.

01:40:03.412 --> 01:40:07.447
He was the master of polyphony,
if you know what that is.

01:40:07.448 --> 01:40:09.751
No. Yet another thing I don't know.

01:40:09.752 --> 01:40:11.586
<i>Well, polyphony is</i>

01:40:11.587 --> 01:40:13.353
<i>from the middle ages.</i>

01:40:13.354 --> 01:40:15.890
It's an entirely
European phenomenon.

01:40:15.891 --> 01:40:17.859
It's distinguished by...

01:40:17.860 --> 01:40:20.762
By the idea that every voice

01:40:20.763 --> 01:40:23.431
<i>is its own melody</i>

01:40:23.432 --> 01:40:26.533
but together in harmony.

01:40:27.734 --> 01:40:30.370
Bach's forerunner Palestrina,

01:40:30.371 --> 01:40:33.408
he wrote many works
for several choirs

01:40:33.409 --> 01:40:37.544
at the same time,
wallowing in polyphony.

01:40:46.788 --> 01:40:49.590
But in my eyes, Bach perfected

01:40:49.591 --> 01:40:52.794
the melodic expression
and the harmony.

01:40:52.795 --> 01:40:55.430
And also... Also mixed
up with some...

01:40:55.431 --> 01:40:59.734
Rather incomprehensible
mystique regarding numbers,

01:40:59.735 --> 01:41:03.769
<i>most likely based on the
fibonacci sequence.</i>

01:41:05.206 --> 01:41:07.342
You know, the one that
starts with a zero,

01:41:07.343 --> 01:41:09.477
then comes the one.

01:41:09.478 --> 01:41:13.614
The sequence is created by
adding the two previous numbers

01:41:13.616 --> 01:41:16.918
to create the new one, so
it's zero plus one makes one,

01:41:16.919 --> 01:41:19.686
and one plus one makes two,
and two plus one makes three,

01:41:19.687 --> 01:41:22.824
and three plus two makes five,
and five plus three makes eight,

01:41:22.825 --> 01:41:25.193
and eight plus five makes 13.

01:41:25.194 --> 01:41:27.195
The sequence has an
interesting connection

01:41:27.196 --> 01:41:29.963
<i>to Pythagoras' theorem
and the golden section.</i>

01:41:31.431 --> 01:41:35.203
<i>It was all about finding
a divine methodology</i>

01:41:35.204 --> 01:41:36.602
<i>in art and architecture.</i>

01:41:36.603 --> 01:41:38.673
<i>A bit like the way a tritone...</i>

01:41:38.674 --> 01:41:41.242
<i>Which was played on the
piano in your little club...</i>

01:41:41.243 --> 01:41:44.544
<i>Was supposed to be a
satanic interval.</i>

01:41:44.545 --> 01:41:47.849
<i>The sum of the numeric values
represented in Bach's name</i>

01:41:47.850 --> 01:41:51.818
<i>is 14, a number he often
used in his compositions.</i>

01:41:51.819 --> 01:41:53.955
<i>The clever thing about Bach's name</i>

01:41:53.956 --> 01:41:57.225
is that the numeric value
of the individual letters

01:41:57.226 --> 01:41:59.759
are all fibonacci numbers.

01:42:02.462 --> 01:42:04.766
This piece has three voices:

01:42:04.767 --> 01:42:06.500
A bass voice...

01:42:11.938 --> 01:42:14.174
The second voice played
with the left hand...

01:42:18.713 --> 01:42:21.281
The first voice played
with the right hand.

01:42:21.282 --> 01:42:24.552
<i>That is called</i> cantus firmus
<i>or "can-toos feer-mus."</i>

01:42:24.553 --> 01:42:28.355
And together, these three
voices create the polyphony.

01:42:31.826 --> 01:42:35.662
Normally, a nymphomaniac is seen as

01:42:35.663 --> 01:42:38.700
someone who can't get enough

01:42:38.701 --> 01:42:41.636
and therefore has sex with
many different people.

01:42:41.637 --> 01:42:43.371
<i>Well, that of course is true,</i>

01:42:43.372 --> 01:42:45.540
<i>but if I'm to be honest,</i>

01:42:45.541 --> 01:42:48.009
<i>I see it precisely as...</i>

01:42:48.010 --> 01:42:53.179
The sum of all these different
sexual experiences.

01:42:54.482 --> 01:42:59.151
So in that way,
I have only one lover.

01:43:03.056 --> 01:43:05.992
<i>Since the music has three voices,</i>

01:43:05.994 --> 01:43:09.628
<i>I will limit myself to
talking about three lovers.</i>

01:43:10.865 --> 01:43:14.302
<i>That's F.</i>

01:43:14.303 --> 01:43:18.605
<i>F had a red car that
he'd bought used.</i>

01:43:20.540 --> 01:43:22.410
<i>As I was having sex</i>

01:43:22.411 --> 01:43:25.780
<i>with seven or eight men
every night at the time,</i>

01:43:25.781 --> 01:43:28.316
<i>scheduling was tricky</i>

01:43:28.317 --> 01:43:31.686
<i>and they all had to have
precise appointments.</i>

01:43:31.687 --> 01:43:34.322
<i>F was a good man.</i>

01:43:34.323 --> 01:43:37.325
<i>If he was scheduled for 10:00,</i>

01:43:37.326 --> 01:43:39.494
<i>he always showed up around 9:00</i>

01:43:39.495 --> 01:43:41.796
<i>and parked down in the street.</i>

01:43:41.797 --> 01:43:44.598
<i>I always smiled when I saw him.</i>

01:43:45.565 --> 01:43:47.667
<i>Often I took pity on him</i>

01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:49.404
<i>and gave him a cup of coffee</i>

01:43:49.405 --> 01:43:52.304
<i>while I was finishing
with the one before.</i>

01:43:54.674 --> 01:43:57.712
<i>It's hard to say why I'm
choosing to talk about F,</i>

01:43:57.713 --> 01:43:59.981
<i>but he was reassuring,</i>

01:43:59.982 --> 01:44:03.850
<i>and he knew exactly what
I wanted when we had sex.</i>

01:44:03.851 --> 01:44:07.355
<i>No, I'd go even further and say</i>

01:44:07.356 --> 01:44:10.892
<i>that there was a kind of telepathy
going on when we had sex.</i>

01:44:10.893 --> 01:44:13.795
<i>Without words,</i>

01:44:13.796 --> 01:44:15.962
<i>he knew exactly what I wanted,</i>

01:44:15.963 --> 01:44:20.032
<i>where he should touch me
and what he should do.</i>

01:44:21.436 --> 01:44:26.441
<i>The most sacred goal
for F was my orgasm.</i>

01:44:26.442 --> 01:44:29.409
Well, and then...

01:44:29.410 --> 01:44:33.648
The swans answered
in the same voice.

01:44:33.649 --> 01:44:37.783
<i>And granted him privileges
none of the others received.</i>

01:44:46.694 --> 01:44:50.597
<i>Monotone, predictable
and ritualistic.</i>

01:44:50.598 --> 01:44:52.532
<i>No doubt about it.</i>

01:44:52.533 --> 01:44:56.636
<i>But also the foundation
that is so important</i>

01:44:56.637 --> 01:45:00.706
<i>even if, on its own,
it doesn't mean much.</i>

01:45:31.772 --> 01:45:34.074
<i>G was quite different.</i>

01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:39.547
<i>The only one I had to
and wanted to wait for.</i>

01:45:39.548 --> 01:45:43.116
<i>When he finally turned up
and I opened the door,</i>

01:45:43.117 --> 01:45:46.153
<i>he didn't immediately enter,</i>

01:45:46.154 --> 01:45:48.823
<i>the way a cat doesn't
when you let it in,</i>

01:45:48.824 --> 01:45:51.459
<i>as if once the door is open,</i>

01:45:51.460 --> 01:45:54.326
<i>it has all the time in the world.</i>

01:46:00.735 --> 01:46:02.904
<i>But he was more than a cat.</i>

01:46:02.905 --> 01:46:06.740
<i>He was like some kind
of jaguar or leopard.</i>

01:46:08.175 --> 01:46:09.943
<i>He moved like them,</i>

01:46:09.944 --> 01:46:13.379
<i>which turned me on no end.</i>

01:46:22.924 --> 01:46:25.058
<i>He was in charge.</i>

01:46:25.059 --> 01:46:27.827
<i>That's the way it was.</i>

01:47:23.184 --> 01:47:25.652
<i>Despite my success in managing</i>

01:47:25.653 --> 01:47:28.823
<i>the complicated logistics
involved in arranging</i>

01:47:28.824 --> 01:47:32.059
<i>up to 10 daily sexual satisfactions</i>

01:47:32.060 --> 01:47:35.162
<i>while also having a full-time job,</i>

01:47:35.163 --> 01:47:38.231
<i>I was still prone to
a certain sadness.</i>

01:47:38.232 --> 01:47:41.601
<i>So when my busy life
allowed a few breaks,</i>

01:47:41.602 --> 01:47:44.070
<i>I used them to take my walks.</i>

01:47:44.871 --> 01:47:47.406
<i>These repeated walks became</i>

01:47:49.677 --> 01:47:51.610
<i>monotonous and pointless.</i>

01:47:53.046 --> 01:47:55.816
<i>Yes, precisely like</i>

01:47:55.817 --> 01:47:57.951
<i>the movements of a caged animal.</i>

01:47:59.587 --> 01:48:02.621
<i>Basically, we're all waiting
for permission to die.</i>

01:49:09.790 --> 01:49:11.658
<i>No.</i>

01:49:11.659 --> 01:49:13.660
<i>No no no.</i>

01:49:13.661 --> 01:49:15.062
No, there...

01:49:15.063 --> 01:49:17.864
There are some completely
unrealistic coincidences

01:49:17.865 --> 01:49:19.933
in your story about Jerome.

01:49:21.334 --> 01:49:24.004
First, by chance he hires you as...

01:49:24.005 --> 01:49:26.873
As an assistant and then you
take a walk in a forest

01:49:26.874 --> 01:49:28.875
that is littered with
photographs of him.

01:49:28.876 --> 01:49:32.211
And not only that, he's present.

01:49:33.046 --> 01:49:34.749
And then like a God,

01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:37.218
pulls you up to him
through the clouds.

01:49:37.219 --> 01:49:39.953
<i>Goodness gracious.</i>

01:49:41.309 --> 01:49:42.989
<i>Jerome was there because he had</i>

01:49:42.991 --> 01:49:44.759
<i>just had a fight with his wife,</i>

01:49:44.760 --> 01:49:46.693
<i>who, in anger, tore
up the photographs</i>

01:49:46.694 --> 01:49:48.829
<i>they just had developed
from their travels.</i>

01:49:48.830 --> 01:49:51.398
<i>Oh, I don't know if
I can believe this.</i>

01:49:51.399 --> 01:49:54.935
<i>Which way do you think you'd
get the most out of my story?</i>

01:49:54.936 --> 01:49:57.872
<i>By believing in it or
by not believing in it?</i>

01:49:57.873 --> 01:49:59.973
<i>No, you're right.</i>

01:49:59.974 --> 01:50:02.208
<i>You might have a
point with all this.</i>

01:50:05.713 --> 01:50:10.349
The secret ingredient
to sex is love.

01:50:13.888 --> 01:50:17.224
The third voice: The secret ingredient.

01:50:17.225 --> 01:50:20.059
<i>Cantus firmus.</i>

01:51:03.136 --> 01:51:05.538
Ah.

01:51:39.139 --> 01:51:42.108
Fill all my holes.

01:52:41.268 --> 01:52:44.537
What's wrong? Hmm?

01:52:45.972 --> 01:52:48.141
I can't feel anything.

01:52:48.142 --> 01:52:50.342
- Huh?
- I can't feel anything.

01:52:52.512 --> 01:52:55.281
I can't feel anything.

01:52:57.451 --> 01:53:00.086
I can't... anything.
