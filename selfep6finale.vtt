Why do you take the gun out here? to play?

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:33.485
You think I'm playing?

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.340
What the fuck are you doing?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.297
What the fuck is wrong with you?

00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:45.102
Why are you talking to June?

00:00:53.661 --> 00:00:54.733
Hey.. please listen to me.

00:00:55.462 --> 00:00:56.478
before I came to meet you at your dorm

00:00:57.207 --> 00:00:58.150
I met June first..

00:00:58.697 --> 00:01:00.000
And he was the one who gave me your address.

00:01:01.396 --> 00:01:02.514
Why did you do this?

00:01:03.792 --> 00:01:04.753
Well, June's just being a nice person..

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:07.045
If there is anything about you, I just ask him.

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:10.060
The reason I didn't tell you is because I don't want you to get in trouble with him.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.103
Then do you know?

00:01:11.714 --> 00:01:12.347
this fucking asshole June,

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:14.516
is P'Fei's brother.

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:26.379
June : P'Tang, it's me June..

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:41.481
The Final Decision

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:46.289
It's very hot these days.

00:01:46.455 --> 00:01:52.116
If we can go to some place cool.. 
with comfortable weather.. that would be good,

00:01:53.786 --> 00:01:54.609
What's that? Mom..

00:01:55.301 --> 00:01:56.550
Well..

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.237
I don't even know either

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:01.847
Japan!!!!

00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:04.675
Are you for real??

00:02:06.223 --> 00:02:06.723
Hey mom!!!

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:10.823
Didn't you say that you'll wait for the bonus first?

00:02:10.948 --> 00:02:12.948
I found the fire sale tickets

00:02:13.641 --> 00:02:15.436
thank you!!!!!

00:02:15.761 --> 00:02:19.648
Thank you, mom / Don't mind that

00:02:20.823 --> 00:02:22.400
I'm glad to see you guys happy,

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.671
well.. go have your dinner

00:02:23.788 --> 00:02:24.393
okay, ma'am!

00:02:25.655 --> 00:02:26.835
Let's eat 

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:30.110
Yeah let's eat!

00:02:36.883 --> 00:02:37.554
Mom..

00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:46.456
there is a guy at school who reads manga like dad too.

00:02:47.607 --> 00:02:48.896
you mean Dragon Ball?

00:02:51.488 --> 00:02:54.586
Yes... you know it too?

00:02:56.063 --> 00:02:59.225
Of course! your dad likes it a lot.

00:03:01.472 --> 00:03:04.402
There's plenty of them in his room. You just haven't went there.

00:03:06.172 --> 00:03:09.345
Anyway… who are you going to read  with?

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.191
Read with who huh??

00:03:13.516 --> 00:03:14.180
There's no one!

00:03:14.618 --> 00:03:15.743
Hmm? / Shut up, June...

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.016
Well...can I go upstairs and read them?

00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:24.620
Why not! that's fine by me..

00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:31.438
I'm just worry about you. After your father died, you never spoke of him no more.

00:03:32.113 --> 00:03:34.363
Whenever I talk about him, you always  feel sad.

00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:41.746
Umm.. being sad is no good, mom.

00:03:43.224 --> 00:03:44.974
just considering it as opening-up for new things!

00:03:47.794 --> 00:03:49.051
What are you looking at, June?

00:03:52.843 --> 00:03:55.860
May I go to dad's room. / Sure :)

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:10.299
I like you, Neo

00:04:10.375 --> 00:04:12.308
I think of you as just a bro.

00:04:12.445 --> 00:04:14.394
Have you tried to open your heart to me yet?

00:04:15.584 --> 00:04:17.584
Please stop messing with me

00:04:19.298 --> 00:04:19.863
P'Fei..

00:04:21.203 --> 00:04:22.681
I saw you arguing with him..

00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:25.061
An asshole like him..

00:04:26.154 --> 00:04:27.376
Don't talk about Neo that way, dude

00:04:30.148 --> 00:04:31.472
He didn't do anything wrong.

00:04:32.294 --> 00:04:33.583
Can you just give up on him?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.712
If it was that easy...I would have done it a long time ago, June.

00:04:44.387 --> 00:04:46.082
But I won't give up

00:04:47.643 --> 00:04:48.194
This is just easy peasy.

00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:51.791
Just leave us alone.

00:05:01.742 --> 00:05:04.573
June, let's bring the luggage upstairs to prepare. Okay?

00:05:04.873 --> 00:05:05.424
Okay, mom

00:05:12.411 --> 00:05:13.734
Hello.

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:14.766
Hello,

00:05:14.766 --> 00:05:17.797
Is that the parent of Intouch Sae-pong? 

00:05:19.383 --> 00:05:21.336
Yes. Is there anything wrong?

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:23.978
Well, there's an accident of him.

00:05:23.978 --> 00:05:26.116
Can you please come to the crime scene?

00:05:26.471 --> 00:05:26.971
WHAT???

00:05:28.253 --> 00:05:29.210
Is it true?

00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:33.225
What happened? / Who was it? 

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:36.389
What happened?

00:05:36.661 --> 00:05:38.075
Why is there the blood all over?

00:05:38.223 --> 00:05:39.754
Police : Who witnessed the event?

00:05:40.127 --> 00:05:41.106
And who is that student?

00:05:42.707 --> 00:05:43.750
Hey, what's wrong with him?

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.305
Calm down

00:05:46.305 --> 00:05:47.076
Fei!!!!

00:05:47.263 --> 00:05:48.694
Who is that in student uniform?

00:05:49.268 --> 00:05:49.932
Calm down

00:05:49.933 --> 00:05:50.976
Fei!!  It's really Fei!!

00:05:51.205 --> 00:05:53.205
Officer!! He is my son!!!

00:05:53.205 --> 00:05:54.426
Ma'am, calm down

00:05:54.588 --> 00:05:55.403
Fei!!!!!!

00:05:55.574 --> 00:05:56.992
Please stay away..

00:05:56.993 --> 00:05:58.091
Fei!!!!!!!!!!

00:05:58.524 --> 00:06:01.079
You can't get in now, ma'am.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.063
Calm down ma'am

00:06:02.063 --> 00:06:03.304
Please let the officers do their duty first.

00:06:03.304 --> 00:06:04.904
Fei!!!!!!!!

00:06:04.904 --> 00:06:06.904
Don't take photos. Don't take photos.

00:06:07.957 --> 00:06:10.043
You can't go in there now, ma'am.

00:06:10.194 --> 00:06:10.699
Fei!!!!

00:06:10.863 --> 00:06:13.583
Ma'am, take it easy,

00:06:13.812 --> 00:06:15.812
what's wrong?? / What's going on

00:06:15.812 --> 00:06:16.912
Do not take the photos!

00:06:16.912 --> 00:06:19.800
Heard that he was pushing down by that guy in student uniform.

00:06:20.853 --> 00:06:22.853
Let me in!! My son!!

00:06:22.989 --> 00:06:24.881
Blood all over the floor

00:06:24.881 --> 00:06:28.193
Let the officers do their duty first.

00:06:35.252 --> 00:06:41.040
(Fei must not die for free) 
(Neo must be responsible for this)
(Neo Wiang Panya)

00:06:56.485 --> 00:06:58.399
Please calm down, Neo.

00:06:58.399 --> 00:07:01.438
I really don't know that June is the younger brother of Fei.

00:07:02.923 --> 00:07:03.981
Umm, you really didn't do anything wrong.

00:07:05.595 --> 00:07:07.458
Right, that's why you should take it easy.

00:07:07.958 --> 00:07:10.044
But it's June's fault all along!!

00:07:11.057 --> 00:07:12.328
He wants you to leave me alone!

00:07:14.732 --> 00:07:15.232
So..

00:07:15.586 --> 00:07:17.129
I'm going to get rid of him!!

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:18.332
I will kill him!!!!

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:20.989
If you're going to kill him,

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:23.525
You just shoot me.

00:07:25.883 --> 00:07:26.598
Get out of my way!

00:07:27.403 --> 00:07:27.903
No!

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:30.431
Please just let him go

00:07:32.346 --> 00:07:33.652
I'm right here with you.

00:07:35.386 --> 00:07:36.569
That's enough, isn't it?

00:07:52.561 --> 00:07:54.194
I'm sorry I talked to him.

00:07:56.513 --> 00:07:58.513
But can you please don't go..

00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:01.864
Promise me you won't go

00:08:03.867 --> 00:08:05.867
Okay.

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:10.422
 

00:08:10.422 --> 00:08:12.025
You for real?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Neo : I have to talk to you

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:36.223
(June read)

00:08:36.223 --> 00:08:39.757
June : Meet me at the place

00:08:39.757 --> 00:08:42.402
June : that you killed P'Fei

00:09:34.894 --> 00:09:36.593
Tang : Where are you?

00:09:36.593 --> 00:09:38.914
Tang : You promised me you won't go.

00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:44.910
(Neo)

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.516
(Fei.. because of you! I will kill you P'Fei!! Why you spread rumors to others that we had sex??? Fuck you! I'll kill you! Bastard!)

00:10:52.402 --> 00:10:54.276
June : I'm here. When will you come?

00:10:54.276 --> 00:10:56.193
June : Or you admit that you kill P'Fei??

00:10:56.193 --> 00:10:58.193
June : Will you stop lying to P'Tang? He doesn't believe you!

00:11:01.881 --> 00:11:04.537
Neo : Wait for me there!

00:11:45.330 --> 00:11:46.072
Damn June!!!!!!

00:11:49.198 --> 00:11:50.623
What the fuck do you want from me?

00:11:52.538 --> 00:11:53.621
See? Everyone look at him.

00:11:54.968 --> 00:11:55.984
Killer's face

00:12:06.474 --> 00:12:06.974
(June be careful!)

00:12:06.974 --> 00:12:07.767
(June be careful!)
I told you I didn't do it!

00:12:07.767 --> 00:12:08.806
(June.. how come are you there?)
I told you I didn't do it!

00:12:08.807 --> 00:12:10.404
(Dude! this's so scary)
I didn't kill p'Fei

00:12:12.307 --> 00:12:13.957
(Neo actually did it!)
The police have evidence..

00:12:13.958 --> 00:12:14.834
(Murderer!!)
that I did not do it

00:12:14.834 --> 00:12:15.973
(Murderer!!)
What the fuck do you want from me?

00:12:15.974 --> 00:12:16.791
(Is this the real situation?)

00:12:16.791 --> 00:12:18.791
Finally... you've shown your dark self.

00:12:20.797 --> 00:12:21.859
If you want me to stop messing with you,

00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:24.401
just admit..

00:12:25.795 --> 00:12:26.994
that you killed my brother!!!

00:12:27.159 --> 00:12:29.336
I told you I didn't do it. I didn't kill Fei,

00:12:30.192 --> 00:12:30.820
Do you know..

00:12:32.970 --> 00:12:34.202
how much does P'Fei love you?

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:35.508
He would do anything for you.

00:12:36.448 --> 00:12:37.334
If you didn't love him

00:12:38.543 --> 00:12:39.476
just reject him!

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:41.781
Why do you make it to be like this?

00:12:42.498 --> 00:12:43.574
I told you I didn't do it!!

00:12:45.469 --> 00:12:46.895
The police have the proof that I didn't do anything.

00:12:47.354 --> 00:12:50.081
That day, it was just you and P'Fei all alone.

00:12:50.493 --> 00:12:51.470
You could say anything.

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:52.569
But you know what

00:12:53.248 --> 00:12:54.190
Since P'Fei died

00:12:55.047 --> 00:12:56.078
My mom went crazy

00:12:56.731 --> 00:13:00.414
Fei!!!!! / Don't take photos,  please

00:13:00.537 --> 00:13:02.537
You can't get in there now.

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:06.995
And do you know?...how long I have to live like this,

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:09.478
June..

00:13:10.984 --> 00:13:13.208
Did Fei tell you the time he will be back?

00:13:15.531 --> 00:13:17.029
Let's prepare to go to Japan okay?

00:13:23.023 --> 00:13:23.796
Mom..

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.261
You killed P'Fei! Just accepted it.

00:13:27.611 --> 00:13:30.478
But you can't make me accept the thing I didn't do!

00:13:31.193 --> 00:13:32.099
You're a murderer!

00:13:32.099 --> 00:13:33.019
Everyone hates you!

00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:37.009
Everyone! you guys see that he has a gun right?

00:13:37.714 --> 00:13:39.199
(So.. it's Neo right?) (We miss Fei)
Please call the police to arrest him.

00:13:39.730 --> 00:13:41.730
This motherfucker is a true murderer!

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.125
Does everyone still believe him?

00:13:44.536 --> 00:13:47.131
A guy like you do not deserve to be alive!

00:13:47.569 --> 00:13:48.617
Nobody wants to be with you!

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.693
Fuck! This is all because of you!

00:13:54.158 --> 00:13:55.464
Even your family..

00:13:55.464 --> 00:13:57.464
also left you to die alone!

00:14:05.214 --> 00:14:06.147
Don't!! Neo,

00:14:07.423 --> 00:14:09.423
Let go!

00:14:13.116 --> 00:14:14.175
What the fuck you think you doing?

00:14:15.569 --> 00:14:17.199
I have to be responsible for all of this..

00:14:22.373 --> 00:14:22.981
Listen to me

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:24.988
You didn't do anything wrong!

00:14:31.310 --> 00:14:31.896
P'Tang..

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:34.205
I didn't mean to

00:14:36.382 --> 00:14:36.882
P'Tang!!!

00:14:38.034 --> 00:14:39.104
Do you still believe him?

00:14:41.082 --> 00:14:41.676
Don't you see that he..

00:14:41.676 --> 00:14:42.641
Shut the fuck up, June!

00:14:45.519 --> 00:14:46.709
I'm so sorry..

00:14:48.734 --> 00:14:49.234
Neo,

00:14:50.016 --> 00:14:50.895
you didn't do anything wrong...

00:14:51.585 --> 00:14:52.390
I don't have to apologize anymore.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.421
I want you to believe me

00:14:56.708 --> 00:14:58.079
the person who always be with you

00:14:59.491 --> 00:15:02.206
the person who truly see that you mean no harm

00:15:04.041 --> 00:15:07.064
but you're the one who really cares other people gentlely.

00:15:08.479 --> 00:15:10.273
I don't know what will happen after this..

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.143
but I'll be by your side..

00:15:13.914 --> 00:15:15.413
like you being by my side all along.

00:15:19.863 --> 00:15:25.809
Everyone.. I'm sorry that I couldn't reclaim justice for P'Fei.

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:29.553
(Anyone call police??) (Don't blame yourself)
I don't know..

00:15:30.457 --> 00:15:32.355
what to live for?

00:15:33.004 --> 00:15:34.267
May my death be..

00:15:36.411 --> 00:15:38.411
be their fault!

00:15:51.157 --> 00:15:51.794
Hey, don't!!! 

00:15:51.794 --> 00:15:53.356
Well, I'm a murderer!!

00:15:55.012 --> 00:15:55.754
I admit it.

00:15:59.516 --> 00:16:01.184
Do anything change then?

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.426
Will P'Fei revive?

00:16:09.434 --> 00:16:10.724
Will your mother be happy?

00:16:11.202 --> 00:16:12.753
I live after that day..

00:16:13.354 --> 00:16:14.916
with the feeling of me being a murderer..

00:16:16.293 --> 00:16:17.071
I feel guilty

00:16:17.785 --> 00:16:19.448
I'm sorry that I couldn't stop P'Fei in time.

00:16:20.745 --> 00:16:22.985
I don't want P'Fei to be gone from my life.

00:16:29.596 --> 00:16:31.619
Please stay alive.. 

00:16:31.619 --> 00:16:33.619
For P'Fei..

00:17:24.447 --> 00:17:25.951
Keep on living..

00:18:06.014 --> 00:18:09.514
Want to shout out loud?

00:18:11.742 --> 00:18:14.672
And if there is a wall, you'll be ready to crash through.

00:18:15.827 --> 00:18:19.444
But no one cares what you do.

00:18:19.444 --> 00:18:24.698
You must be missing someone you never knew, never seen..

00:18:24.698 --> 00:18:28.962
Never judge what you've been.

00:18:28.962 --> 00:18:31.938
(Documents for school registration)
That make this person..

00:18:31.938 --> 00:18:34.090
become a villain.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:37.102
And live without a heart for anyone to love

00:18:38.211 --> 00:18:42.860
I want to tell you that I see you there

00:18:42.860 --> 00:18:47.217
I want you to know that when you turn around you will see me

00:18:47.257 --> 00:18:51.474
Standing out the window and still waiting

00:18:51.474 --> 00:18:55.667
'Cause I know we'll have a brighter day

00:18:55.707 --> 00:19:00.425
But if there's not one person left to trust..

00:19:00.426 --> 00:19:02.426
Can I be that one you could trust?

00:19:51.539 --> 00:19:55.847
Self เราเห็นนาย
(Self, I see you)
