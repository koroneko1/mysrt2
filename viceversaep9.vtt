00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.741
Characters, actions, locations, occupations, and events in this series

00:00:06.741 --> 00:00:09.737
are fictional and created for entertainment purposes only.

00:00:09.737 --> 00:00:14.878
They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

00:00:14.991 --> 00:00:17.599
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:18.595 --> 00:00:21.470
Chang will be working on a series project until next year.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.244
Have you tried indie movie directors?

00:00:23.244 --> 00:00:25.682
My brother sent me a contact of this guy named Mek.

00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:29.439
Stop giving Tess a hard time.

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:31.578
I think I’m falling back to liking him again.

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:34.412
I don’t like to see you getting close to Mek.

00:00:34.412 --> 00:00:36.594
Especially, he looks like someone you liked before.

00:00:36.594 --> 00:00:37.840
I like you,

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:41.391
even though I don’t know what you look like.

00:00:41.391 --> 00:00:42.756
But I like you.

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:45.931
Hey!

00:00:50.268 --> 00:00:51.337
Mek…

00:00:51.337 --> 00:00:52.322
Don’t say a word.

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:03.226
I know that you have had a crush on Tess since high school.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.310
I thought you had forgotten all about him.

00:01:08.526 --> 00:01:10.300
But from your action today,

00:01:10.908 --> 00:01:13.755
it is obvious how much you like him.

00:01:17.532 --> 00:01:18.657
I’m sorry.

00:01:18.657 --> 00:01:19.837
You don’t need to apologize to me.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.985
I told Tess that I like him

00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:23.506
because

00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:25.758
I just want to mess up with your head.

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:26.605
What?!

00:01:28.783 --> 00:01:29.739
I…

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:32.364
I know you have been liking him for a long time.

00:01:32.524 --> 00:01:34.185
I want your wish to come true.

00:01:34.693 --> 00:01:36.693
This surprising thing to me is that

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:39.356
Tess also feels the same way.

00:01:44.114 --> 00:01:45.324
Wait.

00:01:45.484 --> 00:01:47.484
Are you saying that everything that you did,

00:01:48.536 --> 00:01:49.915
including giving Tess a hard time,

00:01:51.063 --> 00:01:52.696
you did it because you want to mess up with my head?

00:01:52.696 --> 00:01:53.421
No.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.363
I gave him a hard time because I dislike him.

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:01.515
I didn’t plan to ruin his film project.

00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:05.886
From now on,

00:02:06.497 --> 00:02:08.497
please take good care of my friend.

00:02:09.813 --> 00:02:11.390
Don’t make him sad.

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:16.456
Now, let’s go back to work.

00:02:20.265 --> 00:02:21.701
Take my camera with you.

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.037
Don’t forget to take care of me.

00:02:31.508 --> 00:02:32.461
I know it.

00:03:41.006 --> 00:03:42.696
Before the next filming,

00:03:42.996 --> 00:03:44.770
I have something I want to discuss with you.

00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:50.290
This scene is the first morning after Pitch and Toey start seeing each other.

00:03:50.578 --> 00:03:52.578
They sleep in the same bed the night before.

00:03:53.061 --> 00:03:57.685
The script says that they wake up and look at each other while smiling.

00:03:57.866 --> 00:03:59.810
I think something is missing here.

00:04:00.872 --> 00:04:02.336
Who wrote the script for this scene?

00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:03.221
I wrote it.

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.044
Can you show me how the scene should be displayed?

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:10.471
Why?

00:04:10.858 --> 00:04:11.824
Just do it.

00:04:13.066 --> 00:04:14.185
It would help me.

00:04:15.007 --> 00:04:16.330
You too, Tess.

00:04:19.096 --> 00:04:20.084
Me?

00:04:25.591 --> 00:04:26.942
Alright.

00:04:35.578 --> 00:04:37.578
I’ll play the role of Pitch.

00:04:39.246 --> 00:04:41.246
The first thing that he does after waking up.

00:04:41.246 --> 00:04:42.923
He looks at Toey’s face.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.049
He smiles.

00:04:50.021 --> 00:04:54.194
He is happy that they are finally together.

00:04:58.155 --> 00:05:00.409
He reaches his hand to touch Teoy’s face,

00:05:01.332 --> 00:05:06.000
and asks himself if he is dreaming.

00:05:08.793 --> 00:05:10.116
A moment later,

00:05:12.943 --> 00:05:15.084
Toey reaches her hand to touch his face.

00:05:20.708 --> 00:05:22.708
She wants to feel the warmth of the man that she loves.

00:05:40.233 --> 00:05:43.023
I don’t think that matches Pitch’s character.

00:05:44.773 --> 00:05:46.604
That’s simply your personal fantasy.

00:05:47.546 --> 00:05:49.123
You two are displaying too much romance here.

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.948
Wait.

00:05:55.277 --> 00:05:59.027
Did Mek tell you to play the scene for him?

00:05:59.771 --> 00:06:01.037
That’s right.

00:06:01.037 --> 00:06:05.479
He said he wanted to know how sweet the couple would be on the first day of their dating life.

00:06:06.484 --> 00:06:09.246
Then how was it? Was it super sweet?

00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:13.051
It was lucky that Up and I weren’t the ones who did it.

00:06:13.051 --> 00:06:16.282
If we did it, Pitch and Toey wouldn’t be as sweet as your depiction.

00:06:17.243 --> 00:06:18.368
Who said so?

00:06:19.484 --> 00:06:20.891
I think I can be sweet as well.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Add some sweetness to your life.

00:06:32.367 --> 00:06:33.417
Thanks.

00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:40.106
You should drink the whole bottle.

00:06:40.798 --> 00:06:42.290
But it’s late evening.

00:06:42.506 --> 00:06:43.800
Is it a good idea to drink the whole bottle?

00:06:44.512 --> 00:06:45.524
You can drink it.

00:06:45.524 --> 00:06:46.776
It contains no sugar.

00:06:46.776 --> 00:06:48.227
Look at my six-pack abs.

00:06:48.396 --> 00:06:49.143
Really?

00:06:49.143 --> 00:06:49.923
Sure.

00:06:50.331 --> 00:06:53.008
If you don’t believe it, you can touch my abs.

00:06:54.784 --> 00:06:56.445
I don’t feel a thing.

00:06:58.432 --> 00:06:59.074
Immature.

00:06:59.074 --> 00:06:59.783
Tess.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:04.272
It’s true.

00:07:04.893 --> 00:07:05.991
His abs are firm.

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:07.651
Why don’t you try it again?

00:07:08.653 --> 00:07:09.778
That’s enough.

00:07:09.778 --> 00:07:11.664
Being hit a few times can hurt.

00:07:15.002 --> 00:07:17.875
Aou, why do you start to worry about your looks and health?

00:07:18.882 --> 00:07:24.000
Are you having a spark with someone?

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.143
Spill it.

00:07:25.143 --> 00:07:26.499
What spark?

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:28.054
I’m just taking care of my health.

00:07:34.233 --> 00:07:35.210
How is it?

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:38.660
Do you think you and I can be another sweet couple?

00:07:40.578 --> 00:07:41.887
Of course.

00:07:51.435 --> 00:07:54.000
Tun, that’s my seat.

00:07:54.927 --> 00:07:56.927
What? You can take my seat.

00:07:56.927 --> 00:07:58.601
No. My seat is exactly in the middle of the roll.

00:07:58.601 --> 00:07:59.755
This is my lucky seat.

00:07:59.755 --> 00:08:00.529
No.

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:02.751
Go away.

00:08:03.657 --> 00:08:04.895
This is my seat.

00:08:40.134 --> 00:08:41.090
(Let go.)

00:09:09.806 --> 00:09:10.634
Tess.

00:09:12.299 --> 00:09:13.358
Talay.

00:09:26.239 --> 00:09:28.634
I can’t sleep.

00:09:31.626 --> 00:09:33.118
Me, too.

00:09:35.598 --> 00:09:38.416
I want to hold you.

00:09:41.108 --> 00:09:42.826
No.

00:09:45.595 --> 00:09:48.950
Please let me hold you.

00:10:13.285 --> 00:10:15.680
Hold the pillow in the meantime.

00:10:26.977 --> 00:10:30.000
The pillow is you.

00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:36.537
Tun!

00:10:38.176 --> 00:10:39.019
Stop it.

00:10:46.067 --> 00:10:47.474
Stop it, Tun!

00:10:47.918 --> 00:10:49.382
No, dentist. No!

00:10:54.169 --> 00:10:57.016
It’s okay. I sleep talking.

00:10:57.609 --> 00:10:58.706
I’m afraid of dentists.

00:10:58.706 --> 00:10:59.912
You can go back to sleep.

00:11:16.371 --> 00:11:17.197
Hurry up.

00:11:19.963 --> 00:11:21.193
Hi, Hoshi.

00:11:21.654 --> 00:11:24.642
You’re so sweet to come out to welcome us.

00:11:30.001 --> 00:11:32.763
This is the pet clinic that I came to for my research on Dr. Wayu’s role.

00:11:34.134 --> 00:11:36.557
I told the vet that you will come here for a job observation.

00:11:37.227 --> 00:11:39.001
Let’s start with your first lesson.

00:11:39.754 --> 00:11:40.738
Give me your hand.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.593
Good boy.

00:11:44.593 --> 00:11:46.540
Damn it. That’s for dog training.

00:11:47.363 --> 00:11:49.984
Where is the vet?

00:11:50.824 --> 00:11:51.865
I’m here.

00:12:04.767 --> 00:12:05.855
This is Dr. Mix.

00:12:06.194 --> 00:12:08.489
He’s the model for Dr.Wayu’s role.

00:12:09.692 --> 00:12:10.986
This is Fuse.

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:12.565
Yes.

00:12:12.788 --> 00:12:15.945
If you didn’t tell me you are a vet, I would have thought that you were a celebrity.

00:12:16.889 --> 00:12:18.804
He should be an actor more than me.

00:12:19.574 --> 00:12:20.812
Thank you.

00:12:21.565 --> 00:12:24.186
But running the clinic keeps me busy enough.

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:28.059
Welcome both of you.

00:12:28.059 --> 00:12:30.434
If there’s anything you want to know, feel free to ask me.

00:12:31.411 --> 00:12:32.593
Please make yourself comfortable.

00:12:33.796 --> 00:12:35.373
You said we came here for a job observation.

00:12:36.335 --> 00:12:37.912
Who said that?

00:12:38.043 --> 00:12:40.720
You need to do everything as if you are staff here.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.484
Huh?!

00:12:42.376 --> 00:12:43.868
Why are you surprised?

00:12:43.868 --> 00:12:46.649
Dr. Mix is doing almost everything in the clinic by himself.

00:12:46.748 --> 00:12:50.074
You need to help him take care of small errands.

00:12:50.863 --> 00:12:52.863
What are the small errands?

00:12:54.977 --> 00:12:56.525
Damn it.

00:12:57.532 --> 00:13:00.000
This is your small errands.

00:13:03.094 --> 00:13:05.743
How will you get it off if you don’t rub it hard enough?

00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:08.606
You need to rub it harder like this.

00:13:08.606 --> 00:13:09.565
Can you do it?

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:12.411
I’ll go get it myself.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:13.425
Fuse!

00:13:13.425 --> 00:13:15.486
Show me how to do it properly. I don’t know how.

00:13:15.486 --> 00:13:17.215
Does a vet need to do this?

00:13:17.215 --> 00:13:18.467
Shower a dog?

00:13:18.467 --> 00:13:19.405
That’s right.

00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:22.824
You have to do everything that the script says Dr.Wayu does.

00:13:24.256 --> 00:13:26.849
If you scrub only that area, other areas won’t be clean.

00:13:28.091 --> 00:13:31.615
Scrub like this so the shampoo will reach it.

00:13:34.466 --> 00:13:36.692
Why the hell are you looking at me like that?

00:13:40.305 --> 00:13:43.293
No, it’s dirty because of the cat’s pee.

00:13:48.476 --> 00:13:49.601
You can touch it.

00:13:58.009 --> 00:13:59.247
Ouch!

00:14:07.939 --> 00:14:09.770
Its bite is strong.

00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:13.778
Let me tell you, this wound is nothing.

00:14:13.778 --> 00:14:15.328
My wound was much worse than this.

00:14:16.118 --> 00:14:17.723
When will I get to have a dinner break?

00:14:18.001 --> 00:14:19.267
What dinner break?

00:14:19.267 --> 00:14:20.867
You just had your meal not long ago.

00:14:20.867 --> 00:14:22.528
Why is time passing so slowly?

00:14:23.385 --> 00:14:25.808
I want to cry.

00:14:27.808 --> 00:14:29.526
If you want to change your mind,

00:14:29.526 --> 00:14:30.862
I can tell him for you.

00:14:31.957 --> 00:14:33.072
Tell the vet?

00:14:33.072 --> 00:14:35.509
Tell Tess that you don’t want to be a part of his film anymore.

00:14:37.078 --> 00:14:39.360
Do you think you can threaten me with that?

00:14:39.605 --> 00:14:41.153
It’s not going to work.

00:14:41.153 --> 00:14:42.106
It’s not going to work on you?

00:14:42.106 --> 00:14:43.549
I’m not going to stop working.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:46.669
Mix, I want to work.

00:14:46.669 --> 00:14:48.893
Assign me any work.

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:02.067
Talay, I want to ask you to eat shabu at my house.

00:15:02.067 --> 00:15:03.759
My parents are not home today.

00:15:04.727 --> 00:15:06.141
I also asked Up and Aou to come,

00:15:06.421 --> 00:15:07.490
but they said they are busy.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:08.647
I’m busy, too.

00:15:11.271 --> 00:15:12.002
What?

00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:15.650
How can all of you be busy on the same day?

00:15:16.092 --> 00:15:17.296
Is there something I don’t know about?

00:15:17.776 --> 00:15:19.249
You think too much.

00:15:26.195 --> 00:15:31.130
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy happy birthday.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:35.618
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy happy birthday.

00:15:35.793 --> 00:15:42.534
Happy birthday, happy birthday, happy happy birthday.

00:15:47.916 --> 00:15:49.098
Wait.

00:15:49.462 --> 00:15:50.450
Today is my birthday?

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:52.732
Yes, it’s your birthday.

00:15:54.292 --> 00:15:55.982
We didn’t come early

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.367
because we were preparing this cotton candy for you.

00:15:59.204 --> 00:16:02.051
People in this universe celebrate their birthdays with cotton candy instead of a cake.

00:16:04.575 --> 00:16:06.377
Thank you, guys.

00:16:08.484 --> 00:16:09.948
Thank you, Dad.

00:16:10.906 --> 00:16:12.454
Thank you, Mom.

00:16:12.981 --> 00:16:14.981
Make a wish, honey.

00:16:29.055 --> 00:16:29.833
I’m going to blow the candles now.

00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:30.886
Wait.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:34.485
Who on earth blows the birthday candles?

00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:38.495
What do they usually do?

00:16:39.014 --> 00:16:41.127
You will stare at the candles until they are put out.

00:16:42.001 --> 00:16:42.860
Stare at them?

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.832
Yes.

00:16:43.832 --> 00:16:45.330
Why are you acting like you’ve never celebrated your birthday?

00:16:45.330 --> 00:16:47.468
On my birthday, I was staring at them like this.

00:16:51.778 --> 00:16:54.766
Stare at the candles and make your wish.

00:16:54.930 --> 00:16:58.990
As you are staring at the candles, you are staring at your wish.

00:17:20.485 --> 00:17:22.175
What kind of wish did you make?

00:17:22.984 --> 00:17:23.853
I won’t tell you.

00:17:26.534 --> 00:17:28.117
I don’t think it’s that hard to guess.

00:17:29.867 --> 00:17:31.867
You want to go back to your universe soon.

00:17:31.867 --> 00:17:32.865
No.

00:17:36.278 --> 00:17:38.758
My wish is to stay in this universe as long as possible.

00:17:55.441 --> 00:17:57.893
Talay, why are you here alone?

00:17:57.893 --> 00:17:58.835
Pang.

00:17:58.835 --> 00:18:00.327
Can I ask you something about Tun?

00:18:00.327 --> 00:18:06.492
I want to ask you about Tun’s life in the other universe.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:40.191
Talay.

00:18:40.684 --> 00:18:41.853
What do you think,

00:18:42.432 --> 00:18:45.320
if we decide to stay in this universe?

00:18:46.874 --> 00:18:47.642
Why?

00:18:50.296 --> 00:18:51.581
Think about it.

00:18:52.475 --> 00:18:54.352
Here, we have everything.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.193
We have a family,

00:18:57.193 --> 00:18:58.143
friends,

00:18:59.095 --> 00:19:00.778
and new dreams to pursue.

00:19:03.013 --> 00:19:04.421
Your life here is also good.

00:19:05.197 --> 00:19:07.074
Your family supports everything that you do.

00:19:08.537 --> 00:19:10.093
You want to be a colorist.

00:19:10.350 --> 00:19:11.610
You can do it.

00:19:13.938 --> 00:19:15.568
But that’s selfish.

00:19:19.337 --> 00:19:20.646
How?

00:19:22.729 --> 00:19:24.137
If we do that,

00:19:26.038 --> 00:19:28.729
we are stealing the lives of Pakorn and Tess.

00:19:31.858 --> 00:19:32.838
Why?

00:19:35.058 --> 00:19:37.188
Pakorn also stole my life.

00:19:40.029 --> 00:19:44.076
Have you ever asked him if he wants to live your life?

00:19:47.518 --> 00:19:49.173
This is his family,

00:19:50.625 --> 00:19:51.639
and his home.

00:19:52.428 --> 00:19:56.423
We have our families in the other universe.

00:19:57.025 --> 00:19:59.198
We have mom, dad, and friends.

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.554
But I don’t have any of that.

00:20:01.628 --> 00:20:02.863
How could you?

00:20:04.206 --> 00:20:04.887
I…

00:20:04.887 --> 00:20:06.798
Is that why you want to steal his life?

00:20:08.803 --> 00:20:10.803
Because you don’t have parents?

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:20.819
Where is the person who promised to go back with me?

00:20:21.543 --> 00:20:23.218
Are you changing your plan?

00:20:30.268 --> 00:20:32.589
I shouldn’t waste my time on you.

00:20:33.016 --> 00:20:36.323
I hope you are happy living someone else’s life.

00:20:38.094 --> 00:20:39.477
I’m not going to do it.

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:54.858
I think it’s a bit too forced.

00:20:54.858 --> 00:20:56.607
Why does a romantic scene happen in a bar?

00:20:56.607 --> 00:20:58.000
Were you drunk when you wrote the scene?

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.511
Did you use your brain when writing it?

00:20:59.774 --> 00:21:01.601
All you do is criticize others.

00:21:01.601 --> 00:21:03.766
If you have a better idea, then say it.

00:21:03.766 --> 00:21:04.955
I don’t have it yet.

00:21:04.955 --> 00:21:05.916
See? You don’t have a better idea either.

00:21:05.916 --> 00:21:07.549
Even if I don’t have one, I can tell that your idea won’t work.

00:21:07.701 --> 00:21:09.109
So you think your idea will work?

00:21:09.109 --> 00:21:10.506
All you do is criticize other people.

00:21:10.506 --> 00:21:11.139
Up!

00:21:11.139 --> 00:21:12.794
Calm down.

00:21:12.794 --> 00:21:14.218
How can I calm down?

00:21:14.218 --> 00:21:16.512
Why does everything need to revolve around you?

00:21:16.597 --> 00:21:18.338
Are you the center of the world?

00:21:18.338 --> 00:21:20.618
If that’s so, I will pay homage to you.

00:21:22.295 --> 00:21:23.129
Aou.

00:21:23.435 --> 00:21:25.435
Do you think I’m going to make up with you?

00:21:25.944 --> 00:21:26.743
Up.

00:21:26.743 --> 00:21:27.578
Hey!

00:21:27.757 --> 00:21:28.721
You guys!

00:21:46.416 --> 00:21:47.266
What should we do?

00:21:47.818 --> 00:21:49.683
They have been quiet for an hour.

00:21:55.931 --> 00:21:56.717
Aou!

00:21:56.717 --> 00:21:57.586
Up!

00:22:05.458 --> 00:22:06.841
I’m sorry.

00:22:08.036 --> 00:22:10.778
It’s my fault that I didn’t believe you.

00:22:13.218 --> 00:22:14.496
Guys,

00:22:14.891 --> 00:22:16.458
how did you suddenly reconcile?

00:22:16.581 --> 00:22:17.772
Suddenly!?

00:22:17.772 --> 00:22:19.732
This is the longest time that I stay mad at him.

00:22:19.732 --> 00:22:21.148
We usually make up within half an hour.

00:22:21.258 --> 00:22:24.787
We were this upset because of you two.

00:22:26.021 --> 00:22:27.577
How did we have anything to do with it?

00:22:27.898 --> 00:22:30.909
Why not? You two kept making a stern face.

00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:32.532
The atmosphere stressed us out.

00:22:32.698 --> 00:22:33.534
That’s right.

00:22:33.534 --> 00:22:35.099
What’s the problem between you two?

00:22:35.334 --> 00:22:37.258
We don’t like the atmosphere, right?

00:22:40.453 --> 00:22:41.368
Nonsense.

00:22:41.597 --> 00:22:43.218
We didn’t have any problem.

00:22:43.627 --> 00:22:44.568
Right, Tess?

00:22:51.204 --> 00:22:52.214
Yes.

00:22:52.725 --> 00:22:54.725
We are so loving each other.

00:22:56.156 --> 00:22:57.005
Look.

00:22:59.666 --> 00:23:01.666
If I was mad at him, I wouldn’t hold him like this.

00:23:01.863 --> 00:23:02.694
Right.

00:23:03.918 --> 00:23:05.578
Did we misunderstand you two?

00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:06.959
Yes.

00:23:08.474 --> 00:23:10.622
Now, you can relax.

00:23:11.058 --> 00:23:14.242
Actually, he and I felt stressed from work.

00:23:14.579 --> 00:23:15.441
It’s nothing.

00:23:16.181 --> 00:23:17.196
Really?

00:23:17.351 --> 00:23:18.223
Yes.

00:23:18.568 --> 00:23:19.978
Don’t lie to me.

00:23:20.456 --> 00:23:22.456
You guys.

00:23:51.295 --> 00:23:52.106
Talay.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.515
Talay, wake up. We arrive.

00:23:57.850 --> 00:23:58.575
Talay.

00:24:02.251 --> 00:24:03.353
Thank you.

00:24:35.087 --> 00:24:36.218
What are you doing?

00:24:37.083 --> 00:24:38.861
I’m going to wipe the drool on your face.

00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:40.793
You were drooling like a kid.

00:24:47.807 --> 00:24:50.399
I’m going in.

00:24:53.088 --> 00:24:54.066
Wait.

00:24:57.299 --> 00:24:58.350
I…

00:24:58.523 --> 00:24:59.595
Tess.

00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:00.959
It’s good that you’re here.

00:25:01.551 --> 00:25:03.075
I had a fight with my father.

00:25:03.494 --> 00:25:05.864
So I stopped by to watch a movie at your condo.

00:25:16.195 --> 00:25:16.818
But I…

00:25:16.818 --> 00:25:17.541
You should go.

00:25:23.603 --> 00:25:24.764
I’m leaving now.

00:25:39.805 --> 00:25:41.188
The movie is so good.

00:25:41.791 --> 00:25:43.544
I really like it

00:25:43.779 --> 00:25:45.927
I like sci-fi movies about multiverses.

00:25:46.289 --> 00:25:47.049
What about you?

00:25:52.747 --> 00:25:53.658
Tess.

00:25:54.438 --> 00:25:55.163
Huh?

00:25:56.051 --> 00:25:56.857
What?

00:25:58.072 --> 00:25:59.003
What’s wrong with you?

00:25:59.792 --> 00:26:01.626
I saw you looking depressed for some time.

00:26:02.645 --> 00:26:03.978
You can tell me about it.

00:26:13.071 --> 00:26:14.923
Can I ask you something?

00:26:15.466 --> 00:26:16.261
Um.

00:26:17.391 --> 00:26:23.138
If one day you woke up in someone else’s body as we saw in the movie,

00:26:23.551 --> 00:26:24.674
What would you do?

00:26:27.658 --> 00:26:31.594
How is the life of that person?

00:26:34.725 --> 00:26:37.342
It’s great.

00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:39.804
He has a warm family.

00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:42.317
He has good friends.

00:26:43.596 --> 00:26:46.138
He has the financial support to pursue his dream.

00:26:46.358 --> 00:26:47.161
If you were him,

00:26:48.592 --> 00:26:50.480
would you want to live his life?

00:26:53.471 --> 00:26:57.272
If I think about it lightly, I would want to live that life.

00:26:58.653 --> 00:26:59.496
Why?

00:27:00.745 --> 00:27:02.276
It may be better than my life right now.

00:27:05.323 --> 00:27:07.323
What if you had a chance to go back to your life,

00:27:07.896 --> 00:27:08.977
would you do it?

00:27:09.668 --> 00:27:10.340
No.

00:27:10.957 --> 00:27:11.838
Why?

00:27:13.069 --> 00:27:14.576
If I was him, I would go back.

00:27:15.499 --> 00:27:17.992
I don’t want other people to suffer from my hard life instead of me.

00:27:21.824 --> 00:27:22.520
Tess.

00:27:23.655 --> 00:27:26.044
You are not me.

00:27:26.797 --> 00:27:30.622
We all have our own pain that we are enduring.

00:27:32.228 --> 00:27:35.856
You can’t compare your life to theirs and judge them on what they should do.

00:27:36.994 --> 00:27:41.781
We all just follow our gut feelings at the time.

00:28:01.014 --> 00:28:03.738
Talay, why are you here alone?

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:07.490
Pang, do you see Tun?

00:28:08.218 --> 00:28:10.218
I went to his house but he wasn’t there.

00:28:10.615 --> 00:28:13.218
I thought he might be here.

00:28:15.813 --> 00:28:16.999
I don’t see him.

00:28:20.489 --> 00:28:22.020
What’s going on?

00:28:24.589 --> 00:28:26.938
We had an argument.

00:28:30.427 --> 00:28:34.218
I hope you two reconcile soon.

00:28:44.174 --> 00:28:45.112
Pang.

00:28:45.211 --> 00:28:49.036
Can I ask you something about Tun?

00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:53.239
If you are going to ask me about his real name,

00:28:54.098 --> 00:28:55.654
I can’t tell you.

00:28:56.134 --> 00:28:57.429
Not that.

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:05.608
I want to ask you about Tun’s life in the other universe.

00:29:06.242 --> 00:29:07.549
Why do you want to know it?

00:29:10.733 --> 00:29:12.363
I’m close with him.

00:29:14.242 --> 00:29:18.758
But I feel like I barely know him.

00:29:20.662 --> 00:29:23.218
I don’t know what he has been through.

00:29:25.016 --> 00:29:29.310
So there are many times that I don’t understand what he’s thinking.

00:29:36.277 --> 00:29:40.176
But I can’t tell you in detail.

00:29:45.411 --> 00:29:48.218
He has been living a hard life since he was young.

00:29:50.325 --> 00:29:51.538
How?

00:29:53.536 --> 00:29:59.084
His parents died when he was young.

00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.102
He doesn’t have any relatives.

00:30:05.743 --> 00:30:08.113
So he had to work since he was young to support himself.

00:30:11.355 --> 00:30:13.355
He has been living on his own all his life.

00:30:20.296 --> 00:30:22.148
I used to live that kind of life as well.

00:30:23.821 --> 00:30:25.106
So I understand how he feels.

00:30:28.218 --> 00:30:29.922
When I was in the other universe,

00:30:30.991 --> 00:30:32.276
I have no one.

00:30:35.247 --> 00:30:36.754
But when I live in this universe,

00:30:39.034 --> 00:30:40.442
I have a family.

00:30:44.176 --> 00:30:46.299
I have many people that love me.

00:30:53.688 --> 00:30:59.117
There was a time when I felt that I didn’t want to go back to that universe.

00:31:02.579 --> 00:31:04.653
Because I knew even if I got back there,

00:31:06.687 --> 00:31:08.098
There was no one waiting for me.

00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:14.077
I think Tun feels the same way as I did at the time.

00:31:22.373 --> 00:31:24.768
I’d better get going.

00:31:42.397 --> 00:31:44.397
[Tun: I’m sorry.]

00:31:53.253 --> 00:31:54.784
Do you see Tun?

00:31:54.785 --> 00:31:56.070
Didn’t he tell you?

00:31:56.339 --> 00:31:57.938
He went out of town.

00:31:57.938 --> 00:31:59.333
When we went there,

00:31:59.522 --> 00:32:01.522
we usually went to a secret island.

00:32:01.522 --> 00:32:04.185
But when the tide rises, you need to be careful.

00:32:36.697 --> 00:32:38.214
He’s very cute.

00:32:38.571 --> 00:32:39.711
Please come again.

00:32:39.711 --> 00:32:41.032
Sure. Thank you.

00:32:41.032 --> 00:32:41.880
Thank you.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.653
Bye.

00:32:45.847 --> 00:32:47.430
Let’s go back to work.

00:32:47.715 --> 00:32:48.446
Wait.

00:32:49.187 --> 00:32:51.428
Let’s call it a day.

00:32:52.265 --> 00:32:53.066
Why?

00:32:54.265 --> 00:32:57.087
I think I know enough about the veterinary job.

00:32:58.113 --> 00:32:59.345
I don’t need to do the research anymore.

00:33:01.382 --> 00:33:03.821
I think you just don’t want to do hard work anymore.

00:33:04.648 --> 00:33:06.385
How hard do I have to work?

00:33:06.524 --> 00:33:08.107
I did a lot of work.

00:33:09.717 --> 00:33:11.059
You call that a lot of work?

00:33:11.528 --> 00:33:13.769
You only cleaned the floor and bathed a dog.

00:33:14.435 --> 00:33:18.278
You don’t even experience the pressure of treating sick animals.

00:33:19.119 --> 00:33:22.698
Do you know how hard it is to fight to save a life?

00:33:23.051 --> 00:33:23.963
No, I don’t.

00:33:23.963 --> 00:33:25.468
If I did, I would be a vet.

00:33:28.397 --> 00:33:29.871
If you want to leave, you can go alone.

00:33:54.316 --> 00:33:55.504
Why is it bleeding so much?

00:34:07.430 --> 00:34:08.435
What happened to the dog?

00:34:08.874 --> 00:34:10.264
I think it was hit by a car.

00:34:10.264 --> 00:34:11.354
Go get Dr. Mix.

00:34:11.473 --> 00:34:12.473
Okay

00:34:12.473 --> 00:34:13.276
Open the door for me, too.

00:34:32.034 --> 00:34:35.087
Do you think you look hot, sitting topless like this?

00:34:35.197 --> 00:34:35.804
Here.

00:34:40.796 --> 00:34:42.160
How are they doing in the surgery room?

00:34:43.177 --> 00:34:44.497
I’m worried about the dog.

00:34:45.153 --> 00:34:46.627
Just trust Dr. Mix.

00:34:47.127 --> 00:34:49.127
He can run the clinic by himself,

00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:50.652
because he’s a great vet.

00:34:57.819 --> 00:34:59.271
The dog is awake.

00:34:59.366 --> 00:35:01.871
The surgery went well.

00:35:01.871 --> 00:35:05.549
It still feels drowsy.

00:35:05.549 --> 00:35:09.229
I need to do an x-ray of it. Okay?

00:35:09.604 --> 00:35:10.660
Thank you.

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:11.604
Don’t worry.

00:35:16.963 --> 00:35:18.020
That’s a relief.

00:35:25.772 --> 00:35:27.575
It’s a good start for you.

00:35:29.672 --> 00:35:32.725
I think you start to understand more about this profession.

00:35:53.494 --> 00:35:54.481
Hey!

00:35:58.868 --> 00:36:00.342
Do you see Tun?

00:36:01.842 --> 00:36:03.316
I can’t reach him.

00:36:03.943 --> 00:36:05.122
Didn’t he tell you?

00:36:05.824 --> 00:36:07.391
He went out of town.

00:36:08.812 --> 00:36:10.812
He said he wanted to clear his mind.

00:36:11.172 --> 00:36:12.909
So he went to a beach in Aou’s hometown.

00:36:14.386 --> 00:36:15.903
When we went there,

00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:17.797
we usually went to a secret island.

00:36:18.265 --> 00:36:19.804
The scenery on the island was so beautiful.

00:36:20.492 --> 00:36:22.689
After traveling by boat, we need to walk on a sandbar to go to the island

00:36:23.153 --> 00:36:25.855
But when the tide rises, you need to be careful.

00:36:42.529 --> 00:36:43.542
Talay.

00:37:06.633 --> 00:37:08.107
Are you going to cross to the island?

00:37:10.586 --> 00:37:11.220
Um.

00:37:13.511 --> 00:37:16.696
Up said you would be on the island.

00:37:18.592 --> 00:37:19.348
He was right.

00:37:19.611 --> 00:37:20.855
I’m thinking of going to the island.

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.152
Do you want to come with me?

00:37:24.324 --> 00:37:24.987
Um.

00:37:36.796 --> 00:37:37.968
Are you afraid of water?

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.428
No, I’m not.

00:37:43.884 --> 00:37:45.884
If you aren’t afraid, then why are you shaking?

00:37:53.367 --> 00:37:54.059
Hop on.

00:37:54.739 --> 00:37:55.712
What are you doing?

00:37:56.212 --> 00:37:57.019
No!

00:37:57.358 --> 00:38:00.937
Just hop on my back before the tide rises higher.

00:38:01.836 --> 00:38:02.473
Come on.

00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.419
I’m taking off.

00:38:38.031 --> 00:38:40.689
Why did you come to see me here?

00:38:44.749 --> 00:38:46.749
I saw your message.

00:38:49.203 --> 00:38:52.124
I’m sorry that I was too harsh on you that day.

00:38:56.327 --> 00:38:57.713
You didn’t do anything wrong.

00:38:58.511 --> 00:39:00.138
It was all my fault.

00:39:01.182 --> 00:39:03.072
I’m sorry that I said harsh words to you that day.

00:39:05.928 --> 00:39:06.859
No.

00:39:07.583 --> 00:39:09.288
I should be the one who apologizes to you.

00:39:11.408 --> 00:39:12.860
I should be me.

00:39:13.701 --> 00:39:15.175
Are you competing with me again?

00:39:20.528 --> 00:39:21.889
I’ll keep doing that until you feel better.

00:39:28.097 --> 00:39:29.262
I’m fine now.

00:39:41.515 --> 00:39:42.211
Talay.

00:39:43.396 --> 00:39:46.806
Do you know why I don’t want to tell you my real name?

00:39:48.087 --> 00:39:49.582
It’s because you want to tease me.

00:39:51.430 --> 00:39:52.925
That was the reason at first.

00:39:54.952 --> 00:39:58.005
But after that, my feelings changed.

00:39:58.342 --> 00:40:01.812
I don’t want to go back to my old life.

00:40:06.382 --> 00:40:11.181
When I saw Pakorn has a warm family and good friends,

00:40:13.197 --> 00:40:15.570
It made me want to continue to live here.

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:17.800
I understand how you feel.

00:40:20.134 --> 00:40:22.924
Even if I wake up one day and go back to my old life,

00:40:25.515 --> 00:40:27.515
That’s still my life, isn’t it?

00:40:29.204 --> 00:40:30.031
Trust me.

00:40:32.257 --> 00:40:33.818
When you go back to your universe,

00:40:35.318 --> 00:40:36.967
your life won’t be the same.

00:40:39.659 --> 00:40:40.477
Why?

00:40:43.416 --> 00:40:47.691
The first scenario is that Pakorn may ruin your life.

00:40:48.534 --> 00:40:52.574
The second one is that he may make you famous.

00:40:56.530 --> 00:41:00.197
Either way it turns out to be, it’s not as important as this one.

00:41:01.602 --> 00:41:02.668
That is…

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:05.554
At one time,

00:41:08.263 --> 00:41:09.473
You had me in your life.

00:41:12.695 --> 00:41:16.603
♫ I have your heart next to mine ♫

00:41:16.603 --> 00:41:19.764
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

00:41:19.933 --> 00:41:25.574
♫ Forever I need nothing else ♫

00:41:25.574 --> 00:41:29.160
♫ Just you right here is enough ♫

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:33.799
♫ I can get through anything tough ♫

00:41:34.672 --> 00:41:35.869
It’s not that ‘I had you’.

00:41:36.672 --> 00:41:37.782
But it should be ‘I have you’.

00:41:50.266 --> 00:41:51.081
Talay.

00:41:53.516 --> 00:41:56.763
It seemed like I was surrounded by many people.

00:41:58.039 --> 00:42:00.478
But in fact, I had no one in my life.

00:42:02.982 --> 00:42:04.236
So I always thought,

00:42:05.269 --> 00:42:10.735
I wanted to wake up and see that someone was waiting for me.

00:42:14.764 --> 00:42:16.181
Can you be that person for me?

00:42:23.401 --> 00:42:24.194
Sure.

00:42:24.194 --> 00:42:29.422
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:34.545
♫ I have your heart next to mine ♫

00:42:34.545 --> 00:42:38.484
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

00:42:38.484 --> 00:42:43.735
♫ Forever I need nothing else ♫

00:42:43.818 --> 00:42:47.178
♫ Just you right here is enough ♫

00:42:47.178 --> 00:42:51.928
♫ I can get through anything tough ♫

00:42:52.852 --> 00:42:58.537
♫ With you right here by my side ♫

00:42:59.793 --> 00:43:04.908
Today is the first anniversary of the official foundation of Friend Credits.

00:43:04.908 --> 00:43:07.617
I think I found something that has connected us together for a long time.

00:43:08.244 --> 00:43:09.761
Just as Dol said,

00:43:10.279 --> 00:43:11.643
If we are portkeys for each other,

00:43:12.144 --> 00:43:13.771
There must be something that connects us together.

00:43:40.063 --> 00:43:41.702
Here it is.

00:43:46.604 --> 00:43:51.935
Today is the first anniversary of the official foundation of Friend Credits.

00:43:56.418 --> 00:43:58.193
A new way to open the cap.

00:44:00.021 --> 00:44:00.919
Let’s eat.

00:44:00.919 --> 00:44:01.897
This one is for Aou.

00:44:01.897 --> 00:44:03.095
I know you like drumsticks.

00:44:03.095 --> 00:44:04.007
It’s so pretty.

00:44:04.007 --> 00:44:04.948
You know my mind.

00:44:04.948 --> 00:44:06.071
You also like drumsticks.

00:44:11.323 --> 00:44:13.323
It’s already been one year.

00:44:13.323 --> 00:44:14.570
Time has passed so fast.

00:44:16.813 --> 00:44:19.742
We have been through many things together.

00:44:19.742 --> 00:44:20.447
True.

00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:21.844
Our movie was a flop.

00:44:21.844 --> 00:44:22.649
We went our separate ways.

00:44:22.649 --> 00:44:23.521
We got back together.

00:44:23.521 --> 00:44:25.668
We went on a trip and wrote our wishes.

00:44:26.336 --> 00:44:30.039
If we have to talk about our ups and downs, it will take more than ten days.

00:44:30.039 --> 00:44:30.826
That’s right.

00:44:31.486 --> 00:44:34.262
I’m thinking about writing our last wish.

00:44:34.389 --> 00:44:35.304
Wait a sec.

00:44:35.554 --> 00:44:36.639
Stop.

00:44:36.903 --> 00:44:39.364
Sit down.

00:44:41.515 --> 00:44:43.358
We should celebrate first.

00:44:43.358 --> 00:44:45.925
Eat up.

00:44:45.925 --> 00:44:48.592
Cheers with the chicken.

00:45:10.132 --> 00:45:11.116
What did you write?

00:45:11.917 --> 00:45:12.933
I won’t tell you.

00:45:14.671 --> 00:45:15.742
If you tell me,

00:45:15.992 --> 00:45:17.462
I’ll give you my chicken.

00:45:17.601 --> 00:45:18.722
I also have my share.

00:45:20.782 --> 00:45:21.661
Crap!

00:45:24.038 --> 00:45:24.861
Didn’t you see that?

00:45:25.061 --> 00:45:27.340
Up already took your share.

00:45:27.462 --> 00:45:28.506
You can eat mine.

00:45:28.506 --> 00:45:29.662
What are you talking about?

00:45:30.587 --> 00:45:31.836
I won’t tell you no matter what.

00:45:32.223 --> 00:45:34.724
But mine smells so good.

00:45:43.776 --> 00:45:46.177
You ate it. So tell me what you wrote.

00:45:46.923 --> 00:45:48.597
I won’t tell.

00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.729
Stop it, Up.

00:46:00.706 --> 00:46:02.105
Who will be the first one to hand out the presents?

00:46:02.573 --> 00:46:05.374
These are handmade notebooks.

00:46:05.374 --> 00:46:08.152
I drew the picture on the cover, Friend Credits, myself.

00:46:08.269 --> 00:46:11.262
You can use it when you have an idea for a film script.

00:46:11.470 --> 00:46:12.822
Your present is a notebook.

00:46:13.186 --> 00:46:15.887
My present is a pen.

00:46:15.887 --> 00:46:17.415
Your names are engraved on them.

00:46:17.551 --> 00:46:19.175
Tun, it’s your turn.

00:46:19.385 --> 00:46:20.192
My turn?

00:46:23.974 --> 00:46:25.267
Here.

00:46:25.619 --> 00:46:28.622
I drew the Friend Credits design on the t-shirts for the four of us to wear.

00:46:28.622 --> 00:46:29.663
It looks great.

00:46:30.083 --> 00:46:31.782
Your t-shirt looks so cool.

00:46:31.782 --> 00:46:33.382
Look at the back.

00:46:34.467 --> 00:46:35.902
It said ‘Friend Credits’.

00:46:38.875 --> 00:46:39.798
It’s pretty.

00:46:42.822 --> 00:46:43.891
For Tess,

00:46:44.442 --> 00:46:45.782
I have another present for you.

00:46:46.983 --> 00:46:48.432
I get two presents?

00:47:01.562 --> 00:47:02.655
Wow.

00:47:03.562 --> 00:47:04.469
It’s so pretty.

00:47:07.797 --> 00:47:09.196
Tun.

00:47:10.615 --> 00:47:12.262
Why does he get two presents?

00:47:12.882 --> 00:47:15.057
I also want an hourglass like that one.

00:47:15.204 --> 00:47:17.630
That’s right. This is discrimination.

00:47:18.938 --> 00:47:19.778
Yes,

00:47:20.554 --> 00:47:21.514
it’s discrimination.

00:47:35.538 --> 00:47:38.690
I think I found something that has connected us together for a long time.

00:47:39.624 --> 00:47:41.098
Just as Dol said,

00:47:41.791 --> 00:47:43.140
If we are portkeys for each other,

00:47:43.532 --> 00:47:45.532
There must be that something connects us together.

00:47:47.071 --> 00:47:47.940
Really?

00:47:49.267 --> 00:47:50.148
What is it?

00:47:51.932 --> 00:47:52.731
I’m not going to tell you now.

00:47:53.282 --> 00:47:54.383
I’ll tell you later.

00:47:54.697 --> 00:47:56.697
What about you, Tess?

00:47:58.636 --> 00:47:59.647
The present I’ve prepared?

00:48:02.678 --> 00:48:04.142
Here.

00:48:05.033 --> 00:48:06.011
This one is for you.

00:48:06.211 --> 00:48:07.233
Is that a dog?

00:48:07.358 --> 00:48:08.197
Up.

00:48:09.463 --> 00:48:10.528
It’s a monkey.

00:48:16.342 --> 00:48:17.527
Isn’t that a dog?

00:48:17.527 --> 00:48:19.178
I drew the designs myself.

00:48:19.488 --> 00:48:22.340
I drew the animals that I think of when I look at you.

00:48:38.406 --> 00:48:39.404
Here.

00:48:39.987 --> 00:48:43.942
Congratulations on your role in an international film.

00:49:04.156 --> 00:49:05.163
What’s wrong?

00:49:05.782 --> 00:49:07.000
You don’t like it?

00:49:07.905 --> 00:49:08.825
No.

00:49:10.178 --> 00:49:11.759
I just wonder what animal it is.

00:49:13.230 --> 00:49:14.192
Is it a llama?

00:49:15.369 --> 00:49:17.309
It’s an alpaca.

00:49:18.487 --> 00:49:19.711
I don’t know why.

00:49:20.434 --> 00:49:22.942
But I think your personality is similar to alpacas.

00:49:28.854 --> 00:49:30.253
Are you saying…

00:49:30.782 --> 00:49:32.462
…I look stupid?

00:49:33.592 --> 00:49:34.525
That’s right.

00:49:36.904 --> 00:49:41.528
I mean you look shy and gentle.

00:49:58.377 --> 00:49:59.527
Should I wear it like this?

00:50:00.529 --> 00:50:01.705
That’s right.

00:50:02.153 --> 00:50:03.727
But the print is out of place.

00:50:04.961 --> 00:50:06.109
Excuse me.

00:50:25.435 --> 00:50:29.614
Do you want to know what my third wish is?

00:50:33.841 --> 00:50:34.779
Of course.

00:50:38.436 --> 00:50:39.949
I wrote.

00:50:44.391 --> 00:50:46.391
No matter what will happen,

00:50:48.795 --> 00:50:51.462
All I want is for us to reunite.

00:50:58.382 --> 00:50:59.881
We will meet again.

00:51:03.283 --> 00:51:04.611
I’ll search for you.

00:51:10.121 --> 00:51:11.194
Tun.

00:51:12.017 --> 00:51:16.021
I used to worry a lot earlier.

00:51:17.726 --> 00:51:18.662
I was worried that

00:51:19.726 --> 00:51:21.341
If you went back,

00:51:22.822 --> 00:51:24.572
I would be left alone here.

00:51:25.838 --> 00:51:29.641
But after spending time with you,

00:51:30.782 --> 00:51:32.542
getting to know you,

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:38.550
and understanding my own feelings,

00:51:42.134 --> 00:51:43.884
Now, I got the answer.

00:51:49.786 --> 00:51:50.984
I think…

00:51:55.016 --> 00:51:56.594
I am falling for you.

00:52:09.147 --> 00:52:10.922
Can’t you tell?

00:52:13.288 --> 00:52:14.987
I’m falling for you, too.

00:52:16.276 --> 00:52:17.313
Puen.

00:52:19.717 --> 00:52:21.131
I drew the print myself.

00:52:40.046 --> 00:52:41.119
It’s cute.

00:52:55.433 --> 00:52:58.460
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

00:53:29.082 --> 00:53:31.182
I don’t know when we will be able to go back to our universe.

00:53:31.664 --> 00:53:35.392
Then let’s make memories together as much as we can when we are here.

00:53:37.702 --> 00:53:38.477
Here.

00:53:47.042 --> 00:53:48.092
Wow!

00:53:49.562 --> 00:53:52.862
It has the same smell as the crab I ate in our universe.

00:54:02.398 --> 00:54:04.072
Talay, what are you eating?

00:54:04.391 --> 00:54:06.216
Why are your lips pouting?

00:54:06.383 --> 00:54:07.481
That’s right.

00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:17.904
Then you should eat a lot.

00:54:18.304 --> 00:54:19.942
Because I want to see your pouting lips.

00:54:22.094 --> 00:54:23.919
Then feed me the whole bag.

00:54:24.285 --> 00:54:25.934
I’m sick of your over-confidence.

00:54:37.262 --> 00:54:38.686
It’s empty.

00:54:41.923 --> 00:54:42.779
What?

00:54:44.257 --> 00:54:46.478
Your lips are really pouting.

00:54:48.244 --> 00:54:49.142
Hello.

00:54:49.903 --> 00:54:52.702
Do you want to buy a lotus and take a polaroid photo with your boyfriend?

00:54:54.457 --> 00:54:56.657
Take it.

00:55:01.333 --> 00:55:02.081
Here.

00:55:02.231 --> 00:55:03.082
Thank you.

00:55:04.956 --> 00:55:05.929
Here.

00:55:06.422 --> 00:55:09.950
This is a tip for saying that he is my boyfriend.

00:55:10.303 --> 00:55:12.103
Thank you, cool customer.

00:55:16.186 --> 00:55:18.186
Here is for my boyfriend.

00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:25.349
When I go back,

00:55:25.751 --> 00:55:27.751
I will miss this universe.

00:55:31.981 --> 00:55:33.214
You have another bag?

00:55:36.070 --> 00:55:37.413
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:55:37.413 --> 00:55:38.524
Do you want to eat it?

00:55:45.707 --> 00:55:46.454
What?

00:55:46.855 --> 00:55:49.360
One peck for one piece.

00:55:51.491 --> 00:55:52.162
No.

00:55:52.488 --> 00:55:54.042
Okay, okay.

00:56:08.143 --> 00:56:11.796
I submitted our film to Kannes Film Festival

00:56:11.931 --> 00:56:13.130
10 out of 10.

00:56:14.822 --> 00:56:18.550
You make me want to live for a long time to do what I love.

00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:24.246
You make me realize what I love.

00:56:24.792 --> 00:56:27.393
I don’t know when we will get to go home.

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.820
I want you to know my real name.

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:31.538
So you can look for me.
