[Naru] The lion won't think
that we're hunting it here.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.991
[sighs] It'll think it's hunting us.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.370
We get some bait,
then climb up and wait for it.

A hunter doesn't wait. He hunts.
We could be here all night.

If your brother needed you,
he wouldn't have brought you back here.
