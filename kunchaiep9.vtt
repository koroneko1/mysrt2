00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
If you don't want to kill Tian, 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.000
you have to find out what his secret is. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.000
Someone wants to apply for a job.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
If I was in trouble, I should come to you.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.000
So what would you like to work on?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.000
I'm illiterate. I can't read and write.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.000
I can only do the labor job.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.000
but you learn. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I'll be the one to teach you.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.000
Even if you start a little late, 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but I believe you can do it anyway. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I had it checked by Doctor Qi to know that the owner of this tooth

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.000
died because of the beetle orchids.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.000
You two used the beetle orchids to kill someone 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.000
to hide Tian's secret, right?

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.000
I didn't do anything wrong.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.000
You still don't accept it?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Go to Jia's room. Search for the beetle orchid. 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:55.000
There's nothing, Sir. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.000
I have one. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.000
Tell them what you saw.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.000
I saw Aunt Jia buried those orchids in the forest at the back of the house.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.000
Go to the forest at the back of our house now.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.000
Your madam killed Dong to hide a secret for Tian.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Today is the day that I will get the evidence to arrest her. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Sir. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Chan. 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Why did you call everyone?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I didn't. I just walked by and everyone follow me.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
But that's good.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.000
Everyone here will be able to see the evidence at the same time.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.000
What did Madam and Jia use to kill Dong?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Chan. 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
You are here now, the origin of this story.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Let's see what your mother did

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000
because she wanted to hide your secret.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Madam Li even used these peculiar herbs to kill someone. 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Madam.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
If I am not here anymore, 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000
you and Mr. Tian have to take good care of yourself.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
What are you going to do?

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
I will take all responsibility myself. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I'll ensure that it won't get to you. 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Please hold a funeral for me.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Jia. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
We’ve found the box, Sir.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000
This box is the one Jia buried.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Bao. / Yes, Sir. 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Unwrap the box. 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
This is an empty box. 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
What does it mean?

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Empty?

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Do you point out the wrong site?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
How is that possible?

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I saw with my own eyes that Jia put the orchid into the box and buried it here.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000
I told you that there was nothing.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Jia and I didn't hide anything.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.000
Who buried this box?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000
It would probably be the one who slandered us, Sir. 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
That's strange. Slandering

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000
by burying an empty box here?

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Do you believe in someone who has slandered me?

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
I told you that I didn't hurt anyone.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Since there is no evidence, 

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.000
I will continue to investigate this case

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000
until the truth is found.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Doctor.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000
You must stay here with me, helping me find the truth.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000
Nuan really saw it.

00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.000
But I don't know why it's an empty box. 

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Nuan, are you mistaken?

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000
No, I am not. I really saw that. 

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:44.000
I saw Jia took the orchids out

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:46.000
before putting it in the box. 

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Sir, even though Nuan is a bit dumb, 

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.000
but she's not a liar.

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Chan, Nuan. 

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
From now on, you two don't interfere with this anymore.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Why? I'm not lying, Sir. 

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.000
Nuan really saw it.

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.000
Chan, everyone knows

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000
that you and Li don't get along.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
You always tried to beat her.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
People will think that you try to create false evidence.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.000
to slander her. 

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Or lending someone else's hand to attack her. 

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000
So you don't interfere with this again. 

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
From now on, let me handle this on my own.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Fine. 

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
But I hope that if you know the truth,

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
you will judge this matter fairly.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Where is the orchid in the box? Who took it?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
Right, Madam.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.000
It means that someone else has saw it that time besides Nuan.

00:09:55.700 --> 00:10:00.000
This time we might be lucky that a thief stole it before Mr. Song caught us.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000
But the disappearance is definitely not good for us.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000
Who took the orchids?

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
You still haven't slept yet?

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
You're worried about what happened today?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.000
Don't think too much.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000
How can I not think too much?

00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000
You saw it too.

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000
What happened today?

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I…

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
I'm so stressed that I don't know what to do.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Then you can tell me.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
We are friends, I can listen to you.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:52.000
I…

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000
I'm not like everyone else.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000
I am the cause of all problems.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000
If I wasn't here, 

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000
everyone would be happier.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
I made my parents miserable.

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Made everyone suffer.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Sometimes, I thought that…

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.000
If I died, 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000
everyone would be happier.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Don't say that. 

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Your life is precious.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Do you know what the servants here say about you?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000
They say you're humble, 

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000
kind, and don't take advantage of the inferior.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
They love you.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Me too.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000
I…

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
I mean Fu and Mei.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
They think you're kind, so they love you.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000
I…

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Thanks a lot.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Talking to you makes me feel much better. 

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Stay still. 

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000
Tian.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Mother.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
What are you doing here at late night?

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
I…

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.000
I…

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000
How dare you do this, huh?

00:16:15.500 --> 00:16:17.000
Bringing a man to flirt with each other in our house. Who is he?

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Mother, he is my friend.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I brought him to work with me. 

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Are you sure that's all?

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.000
Do you dare enough to bring a man closer to you here?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.000
What crime did I do?

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.000
I want a daughter-in-law, but what I get is a son-in-law instead.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Mother, it's nothing.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
I'm just worried and he came to talk to me. 

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Your life is much better than others. Why are you so worried?

00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Is there anything to worry about, you say?

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
So it's you who took it?

00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.000
Yes, it's me.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I saw Auntie Jia hiding the orchid. 

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.000
I'm afraid that she will use it to hurt someone else later. 

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000
So I took it and kept it myself. 

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
The evidence is so obvious, 

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
are you going to accept now that you have killed someone?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
You killed to hide that I am a homosexual.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
If I really did it, 

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
so what are you going to do?

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Mother.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Why are you doing this?

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Why are you doing this? I've never wanted this, Mother. 

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.000
Don't you know?

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Don't you know why I did this?

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000
You want to maintain your power. You want to be the madam.

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.000
You want me to be fascinated by power like you.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000
If everyone knows what I am, you will lose everything.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Can't you see the love that I have for you?

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000
If I am such a bad woman... If I was an evil, 

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
go tell your father to bring the police to arrest me. 

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Mother.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000
So you and Aunt Jia

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
won't be able to use them to kill anyone again.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Tian, are you sleeping?

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.000
May I come in?

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Yes. 

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
What's the matter? You come here so late. 

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
I want to apologize

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000
that my mother and Nuan caused chaos, 

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.000
make you and Madam Li to be in trouble again.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
You don't have to apologize or feel guilty about anything, Yang.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
In fact, 

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
You or Aunt Chan didn't make all of these things to happen. 

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:32.000
It's me who is the cause of everything. 

00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:35.000
You know that too. 

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Tian.

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000
You told me to stop blaming myself.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000
But it's you who should stop thinking like this.

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:54.000
It's not that you can choose or want all the things to happen.

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Thank you very much, Yang.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.000
About Aunt Chan, 

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
don't think too much. I'm not angry at all. 

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
Tian.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000
You can get angry.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
I know my mom keeps causing troubles. 

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:20.000
And I don't know if she's going to make up a story again.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
But if she makes up something without any evidence like before, 

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.000
I guess no one will believe it.

00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:32.000
I think you have a negative attitude towards your mom. 

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000
If Aunt Chan was not confident, she wouldn't probably say it. 

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:38.000
What do you mean?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
You said as if you knew something.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
It's nothing.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
So from now on, 

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
no one here will be harmed again.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000
Don't worry anymore.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Where are Li and Chan?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
I've arrived here long ago, but I didn't see them.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Do you have any business with those two?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
I just wanted to say hello.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.000
I haven't visited you for a long time.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Honestly, you look haggard.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000
It's not like you're working hard, since you got Tian to help you.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Or do you worry at something?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
You can tell me. 

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
It is. 

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Something strange happened.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Something strange?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
What's the matter, big brother?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.000
The strange thing is…

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000
That you come to see me today.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Don't claim that it is the accounting.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Because it's not the billing cycle yet.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Yesterday, something happened in my house.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
When it’s morning, you come here.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Not to mention when you and Ma brought the police to attack my family member. 

00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000
I haven't investigate the cause yet.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Then you brought me someone who claimed to be Dong's relative.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
You know every movement of my family very well.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Or did someone…

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.000
tell you about this?

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Do you think too much?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Every incident,

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
it's because I really care about you. 

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
Someone like me

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
will never harm you.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Sometimes, 

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
we don't know someone deep down. 

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
You must be tired today.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000
I think I'd better leave now. 

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Goodbye, big brother.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
This way, Madam. 

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
We were almost caught. 

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.000
I did a mistake myself. 

00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:01.000
I want to know about the incident so I hurry here.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
I didn't think that it would make Big Brother suspicious.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
You too. When you want to send me news from now on, 

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.000
be more careful.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:13.000
Yes, Madam.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Who is with Tian?

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.000
It's Jiu, a new worker here.

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.000
He looks good.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Worker?

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
But why do they seems so close?

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
It's like they've known each other before.

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Tian. 

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Be careful.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000
I'm clumsy.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
He's handsome and strong.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Don't fall in love with a man now. 

00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:57.000
Can't you see that there is something strange?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
What strange?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000
I can't explain either. 

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Let's just keep an eye on these two as well.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000
And don't be so obsessed with this worker.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:27.000
Don't forget that your main job is to become a wife of Tian as soon as possible.

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
The day when he becomes the head of the Five Dragons Association, 

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
he can help support our teahouse business.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Yes, Madam.

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Your herbal soup, sir. 

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Sir, your medicine.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Madam. 

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Thank you, Doctor. / Yes. 

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.000
What does this mean?

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
From now on, Doctor Qi will be the one who prescribes medicine for me. 

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Why?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Jia is already doing this duty.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Or you don't trust me, thinking I will poison you?

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000
If it was in the past, I would never have thought of it that way.

00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:23.000
But a lot of things happened.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
I can't trust anyone.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Including me, right?

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
I have been your wife for over twenty years.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000
The good things I have done all the time didn't mean anything, right?

00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.000
Of course it did. 

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Why didn't it mean anything?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
In the past, I have always loved and thought that

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
you are the one who deserves to be my wife, 

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000
and the mother of the Song Family.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.000
You never disgraced me. 

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
You never brought me a hard time. 

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:03.000
You never disappointed me. 

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
But today you are not. 

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000
You aren't the old Li that I knew.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.000
I have no way of knowing your heart, 

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
of what you're able to do today. 

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
If you don't trust me anymore, just send me to the authorities

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:29.000
or kill me now. 

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:34.000
It's still better than being a villain in your eyes. It feels like I’m already dead anyway.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.000
Do you think I am happy?

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Do you think I am not in pain?

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Li.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
If you want me to trust you, 

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
why don't you trust me?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
What's going on?

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:02.000
Why didn't you tell me?

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000
What happened?

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000
What is Tian's secret? Tell me.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Li.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000
I'm also Tian's father.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
You think that if I knew it, I would be able to hurt and destroy my son?

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Tell me. 

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000
What's going on?

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Well…

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
There's no secret.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Fine, fine. 

00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000
You want it to be this way?

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Since you don't accept it, 

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
If the truth is revealed one day, 

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000
don't say that I'm evil. 

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
I'd like to talk to you.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
I thought that I would never see you again. 

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Because since the incident happened, you always avoid me.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Actually, when I come to stay here, 

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
the happiest person should be you.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
That's right. I should be glad. 

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
But I am disappointed that you came back.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:26.000
You are sad because you're afraid that if I am here, 

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.000
you and Madam will do something with difficulty. 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
Or are you thinking of using the beetle orchid to kill someone again?

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Jia. 

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Do you realize that what you did was a bad thing?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000
You are like a doctor.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000
I taught you knowledge and skills to save people's lives.

00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:52.000
But why did you use it to kill someone like this?

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:58.000
If you still have a conscience, admit what happened to Mr. Song. 

00:34:58.800 --> 00:35:00.000
And don't do such terrible things again.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:03.000
I can't admit it

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
because I didn't do it.

00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.000
We've come to this point and you still won't admit it?

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Let Madam Li manage these household affairs. 

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
She is a good person.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000
I am indebted to her.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000
If you pretend that nothings happened and don't get in our way, will it be possible?

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Doctor.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
if you are here, 

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
it doesn't benefit to anyone.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:41.000
You should leave this place to give treatment to others who needs help from you. 

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
No. 

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.000
I must stay until the truth becomes clear.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Because if I leave, someone else might die

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
or is harmed by the knowledge that I taught you.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
I won't let that happen.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Mr. Tian may like this smell of incense cone.

00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.000
He can relax.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Anything could be easier.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Oh, it's a rat. 

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Mr. Tian, I'm afraid of the rat.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Sir. 

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Aunt Jia.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
What are you doing here?

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
I've come to clean up. Just finished now. Excuse me. 

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Cleaning, but I didn't see you carrying a broom or a piece of cloth.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000
And what is this? An incense cone?

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Are you thinking of using the scent to seduce Mr. Tian?

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:36.000
He doesn't like anything with strong scent

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:38.000
or spicy like this.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.000
I know

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
that you want Mr. Tian to be your husband so bad. 

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
But he's getting married.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Don't mess with him again.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
If you mess this up, 

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
I will tell Madam to punish you hard.

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:57.000
Remember this. 

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Delivery schedule

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Thanks a lot. 

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Done. 

00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:57.000
Then I'll keep it in its place.

00:38:57.300 --> 00:38:58.000
Yeah. 

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
You help me like this during this time.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
When you read and write more fluently, you will work faster.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Last night, 

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000
I drew pictures and write the words for you.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
You'll be able to understand more easily and memorize letters faster too.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Here. 

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Did you draw these all by yourself?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Yeah. 

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:55.000
I think we'd better start studying now?

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Yeah. 

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Sorry. 

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Did you hurt?

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.000
No. 

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Where did you get hit?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Here. 

00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.000
Did it swell?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Tian. 

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Yang, what's the matter?

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Pin is here. 

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000
You stay here looking at the pictures for a while. I'll be right back.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Let's go, Yang. Go. 

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000
The publisher just sent the flyers to me. 

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:09.000
I will put them in different places.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
So I want to take you with me.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.000
But since I'm here, it will be strange if I don't meet you. 

00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:20.000
Did I bother you?

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Not at all. 

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
What bother?

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000
You are considered Tian's younger sister.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:36.000
If this land is sold in the future, and you are you free, 

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:39.000
you will become his sister-in-law as well. 

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Yang, what are you talking about?

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
I think I'm blushing now.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Let me put it back. 

00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:50.000
Thanks.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000
I think we'd better review what we've learned.

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:43.000
So I can teach you something new.

00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.000
Jiu. 

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Do you hear me?

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Yes. 

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000
Is the woman who came to see you today your fiancée?

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Lady Pin?

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.000
Right. 

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.000
She's pretty.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Besides her pretty face, she is also a smart woman.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.000
A woman who dares to think and do. 

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000
I'm very lucky to have her as my fiancée.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
If it was someone else, 

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
I probably wouldn't be at ease like this. 

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
I think we should not study today.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
I have a headache.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Should we go pick up Nangnoi?

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000
More people will finish sticking the flyers fast.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
I think that's good too.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Madam. 

00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:07.000
Aunt Li. 

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Where is Tian? Why are you two here alone?

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Tian is at work. So I have to give Pin a ride instead.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
If Pin is going home, I'll let the chauffeur give you a ride.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000
You are alone with the fiancé's younger brother like this.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
I think it isn't proper in eyes of other people. 

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
I know that you are an honorable girl

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
from a noble family. 

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.000
You won't do anything to damage your reputation. 

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000
But we can't stop others' words. 

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Be careful.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000
Madam. 

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:44.000
If you don't have anything to say to me, please excuse me. 

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.000
A toad wishing to eat swan meat.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Don't know your place.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
What do you mean?

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Don't act like you don't know.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
I saw your eyes when you looked at Pin.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
You have feelings for your brother's lover. 

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000
You're just a son of the second wife.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Are you planning to steal the stuff of Song Family's heir?

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Your mom must have taught you well.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
I think you think too much.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Not everyone thinks about power and destiny all the time.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000
If it's Tian's loved ones, I won't bother for sure.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000
But are you sure that Tian loves this?

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.000
Yang.

00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000
How dare you?

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:44.000
I was too kind to you in the past. 

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Yang is really bad.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Perhaps, he finds a way to get closer to Lady pin

00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:59.000
because of an order of Madam Chan. 

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:04.000
These two are always trying to destroy you and Mr. Tian.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Keep an eye on Yang.

00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.000
Don't let him come near Pin again.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Yes, madam. 

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
We have to be careful not only Mr. Yang, but also Mud.

00:47:17.300 --> 00:47:20.000
Today, I met her in Mr. Tian's room again.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.000
She's really thinking of seducing Mr. Tian.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
In fact,

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000
If Mud sleeps with Tian, 

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
I think it will be good.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Maybe if he sleeps with a girl, 

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
he might like it.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
And if they can have children together, it's even better.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000
Do you really think so?

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.000
What are you doing?

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
It's the orchid dust. 

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
I secretly keep it.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:43.000
The orchid dust is the one that causes mushrooms to grow out of insects.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Are you going to produce the beetle orchid again?

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Who are you going to kill ? We're now being watched.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.000
If we do something that is risky, or if someone dies, 

00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:54.000
people are more suspicious of us.

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:56.000
I'm not going to make beetle orchids.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Orchid dust can produce many types of orchids.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
If we put it in the beetles, it will become beetle orchids.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000
But if we put the orchid dust in the cicada, 

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000
it will become cicada orchids. 

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
What is the poison of cicada orchid?

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.000
It's not poisonous.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.000
But it has arousal property.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Good. Hurry up finishing this orchid.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
If we want Tian to have a wife and children, 

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
we need this. 

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Here. 

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000
Tian, thank you so much for coming.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Since Madam saw me and Pin,

00:49:57.500 --> 00:49:59.000
she always keeps an eye on me until I can't go anywhere.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000
For my brother's happiness, I can do more than this.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Yang, Tian.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Does Aunt Li follow us again?

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000
Don't worry. Tian is coming with us. It's okay.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Let's go. 

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Okay.

00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:30.000
Excuse me. 

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Let's go. 

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000
That day when Aunt Li talked to you, what did she say?

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.000
If you're with me, you must be laughing.

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:50.000
Because she said that I was a toad wishing to eat swan meat.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.000
She was right.

00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:57.000
Whoa, you are a swan? I think you are a moth.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
You see me as a moth?

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:02.000
That's right, so others don't eat this moth. 

00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.000
Only this toad can eat you.

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000
About my land, 

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:13.000
someone just contacted me. He's interested.

00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.000
He made an appointment to see the land in two days.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Really?

00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:17.000
I'll accompany you then. 

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Because if you sell it, you will have money to buy back the palace from Madam Li.

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000
So that you don't have to marry Tian.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Right, Tian?

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Where did he go?

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
He's here. 

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000
Tian, you are here. 

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:47.000
You go in first. 

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000
What's up?

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Something bothering your mind? You can tell me.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
You've helped me a lot. Let me help you as well. 

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
It's nothing. I must be thinking too much.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Come on, tell me what's on your mind. Go on. 

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000
I don't know if Jiu is angry or upset with me. 

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:18.000
Jiu? The one you teach him?

00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:19.000
Yeah. 

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Recently, he doesn't seem to talk much.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
He didn't come to study.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
I've thought back and forth. Maybe…

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Did I do something to make him dissatisfied?

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Do you think too much?

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Why are these two thinking so much?

00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:41.000
Yang. 

00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Tian, I think he might just be lazy.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Look at me, I'm also very lazy.

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
No, I can tell. 

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000
He seemed angry or displeased.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:57.000
And he doesn't want to get close to me. 

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Are you guys close?

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Can you ask him directly?

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Someone like Jiu is not very talkative.

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.000
He keeps things in mind.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:17.000
But I think he seems to trust you.

00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:20.000
Now, he might be worried as well.

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.000
Let's do this. You try asking him.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
In case he wants to tell you something. 

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Yang, who is the person named Jiu?

00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:47.000
He's a friend that Tian let him work with him. Why?

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
I'm just surprised.

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.000
Tian seems to be very worried about him.

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000
This way, Mr. Yang.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.000
This is Jiu's room.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Jiu. 

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Jiu. 

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000
He's not at warehouse. Not at home either. 

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Where is he?

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Bloodstain.

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
This…

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:08.000
You did this behind me?

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Why are you in my room?

00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000
What scissors? Why are they stained with blood?

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
It's my blood.

00:56:24.500 --> 00:56:25.000
So what's that letter?

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.000
Didn't you say you couldn't read?

00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:33.000
Are you lying to my brother?

00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:34.000
I'm not lying.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
So why are you so shocked?

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000
I'm just shocked that you broke into my room.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Are you sure that's all?

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000
What are you hiding from me?

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:51.000
If you're confident, show me the letter.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.000
What's the matter?

00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:18.000
What is it?

00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Yang.

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Jiu.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
So what is it?

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Yang, come with me.

00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:37.000
Tian. 

00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:38.000
Yang.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.000
Tian. / Yang.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Tian, let me go!

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Yang.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000
What is this about?

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:52.000
I can hear the noises from outside.

00:57:52.300 --> 00:57:53.000
Tian. 

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
You should beware of this man.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.000
I think he can't be trusted. 

00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.000
What's wrong?

00:57:58.300 --> 00:57:59.000
He...
603
00:58:05,000 --&gt; 00:58:01,000
Come on, believe me.
604
00:58:08,000 --&gt; 00:58:02,000
Yang, come here.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:12.000
What's wrong?

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Why did you say that?

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Tian, listen to me carefully.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
I feel like this man is dangerous.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.000
He's hiding something from us.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:36.000
How can you stay calm?

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000
I can't stand it anymore.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Rome wasn't built in a day, Madam. 

00:58:42.300 --> 00:58:43.000
It will be too late. 

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
I tried to find evidence that Madam Li has murdered Dong, 

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
but it was unsuccessful.

00:58:49.700 --> 00:58:52.000
Now, she and Jia would be more careful than ever.

00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.000
And Tian's wedding is getting closer.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:02.000
Who are they? Your kids?

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Gui. 

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000
What are you doing here?

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:11.000
I'm looking for my brother. 

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Get out first. Go. 

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000
She's the kid of my worker. She likes play around. 

00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:21.000
Don't be too fussed, Madam. Calm down. 

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Waiting for good news.

00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:24.000
What's the good news?

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.000
I've sent someone to probe in to this. 

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Is it true?

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Tian trusts this person a lot. 

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000
I assure you that we'll get his secret for sure. 

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Who is he?

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:45.000
You don't have to know.

00:59:45.500 --> 00:59:47.000
If you know who he is, you won't act natural. 

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:50.000
But if my man succeeds, 

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:54.000
I can assure you that Tian will not get away. 

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Tian. Big trouble. What is he going to do?

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000
So what's that letter?

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
What are you hiding from me?

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Tian

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Is this yours?

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Why are there a lot of Tian's names written here?

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000
Mr. Tian taught me to write, so I tried to write them down. 

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Then why didn't you practice writing your own name?

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.000
This worker is weird.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Right. 

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000
I don't know why Mr. Tian accepted him for work.

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:17.000
He has saved Tian's life.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000
But I thought there could be something more.

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000
Tian

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Don't forget who you are. 

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:06.000
What are you here for?

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.000
Until now, we still can't find any evidence that Madam Li and Jia killed a man.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000
They would have destroyed them all. 

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Sir. 

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
If Madam stops all this, what do we do next?

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
We must continue to investigate until the end.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000
It happened already. 

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
And besides, even if we can't catch them, 

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
the controversy has already arisen.
660
01:04:52,600 --&gt; 01:04:44,000
Chan won't stop for sure. 

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Tian's secret is still a big problem.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:02.000
This meant Madam and Jia can produce poison to kill more people

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.000
because of Mr. Tian's secret?

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Who knows the hearts of men?

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Who knows what else they are going to do?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
What exactly is Tian's secret?

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Why do they have to kill someone to cover up?

01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:26.000
If Jia helps Madam to hide Mr. Tian's secret, 

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:31.000
it is possible that they will make more orchids to kill people.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Sir. 

01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:38.000
Give me a couple of days. I'm going back to Chonburi

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
to find ingredients to make antidote against beetle orchid.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Is there an antidote to the orchid?

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Yes, but I need some time to find things to concoct pills.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Sir. 

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:00.000
While I'm away, please be careful.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:02.000
I will prepare the medicine and keep it for you.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
The stuff that Madam and Jia gives you, 

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
avoid it if possible. 

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Thank you, Doctor.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Doctor Qi has to go back to Chonburi to treat patients for a few days.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
You two, take care and protect Doctor Qi well.

01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Protect?

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:47.000
You think that someone is attacking Doctor Qi?

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Madam. 

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000
You shouldn't ask this.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Doctor Qi is an important one 

01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:59.000
who helps confirm the evidence of using orchid for murdering. 

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000
So we have to protect him from evils.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Doctor Qi leaving the house like this, they must have a plan.

01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:37.000
But it's good for us that he's not here.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000
The orchid dust is in the right time to make cicada orchids.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000
It's time, Madam. 

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Making cicada orchid is more complicated and delicate than other types of orchid.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
The effect of cicada dust mixed with myrrh plant

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:51.000
gives off the smell that causes the cicadas to become intoxicated and can't control themselves.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000
And when the dust flies to catch the cicada, 

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
it will make them powerful.

01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:09.000
They'll breed like crazy.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Cicada is delicate.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000
The weak cicadas will not be able to withstand the effects of the orchid dust

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:19.000
and eventually died.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
To get a cicada orchid each time, 

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:25.000
we needs to make a lot

01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:28.000
in order to find the strong one that survived.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
After that, we wait for the mushroom to grow out of its body.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Cicada sound.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
When will this damn insect stop crying?

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000
Annoying.

01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Why is the cicada making such a loud noise?

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
What's that sound?

01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:36.000
Bao, what happened?

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Why is it so loud?

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:40.000
It's the sound of cicadas, Sir. 

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000
I don't know where it came from.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Their sound is buzzling throughout the house. Don’t know where they are. 

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Strange. 

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000
I have never heard such a loud noise in many years. 

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000
What's this about?

01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.000
Who are you?

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000
I'd like you to check.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.000
Who do you want me to check?

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.000
I don't want to get married.

01:11:51.300 --> 01:11:54.000
Who do you love? Who do you want to marry? Tell me!

01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000
This is where I will let Tian and Pin sleep after the wedding.

01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.000
The cicada orchid is ready for producing the arousal drug.
