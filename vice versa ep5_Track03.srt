Viewer discretion is advised.

4
00:00:18,801 --> 00:00:20,134
How about we fall in love with each other?

5
00:00:20,134 --> 00:00:21,094
No!

6
00:00:21,516 --> 00:00:23,051
We can just fake it.

7
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,120
Love isn’t something you can fake.

8
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:26,760
Will you forgive me?

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,041
Are you messing with me again?

10
00:00:28,182 --> 00:00:29,680
Not messing with you this time.

11
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:37,784
The screenplay comment from Tess’s dad will be here in a minute.

12
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:40,374
I edited it like 10 times.

13
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:43,659
If he wants another edit, then I don’t know what to do.

14
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:46,359
I know!

15
00:00:46,645 --> 00:00:49,012
There’s one thing we can do.

16
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:50,305
Pray.

17
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:51,720
For what?

18
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,520
I did it before and it worked.

19
00:00:54,658 --> 00:00:55,408
Trust me.

20
00:00:55,408 --> 00:00:56,691
Close your eyes. Hands together.

21
00:00:56,978 --> 00:00:59,680
Quickly. Why don’t you do it?

22
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,954
The comment is about to get here.

23
00:01:01,303 --> 00:01:02,106
Eyes closed.

24
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:03,303
And repeat after me.

25
00:01:03,303 --> 00:01:05,952
Abracadabra! It passes! It goes big! it succeeds!

26
00:01:06,335 --> 00:01:11,245
Abracadabra! It passes! It goes big! it succeeds!

27
00:01:12,195 --> 00:01:12,894
Open your eyes.

28
00:01:14,068 --> 00:01:15,000
Now go to the inbox.

29
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:21,356
It’s here.

30
00:01:23,606 --> 00:01:24,777
The first comment.

31
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:28,811
This is his favorite of the three movie titles we proposed.

32
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:31,349
Long Distance Relationship.

33
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:32,834
Damn it!

34
00:01:33,538 --> 00:01:36,680
My Dear, Near and Far I proposed was even better.

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,688
My Dear, Near and Far, my ass!

36
00:01:38,688 --> 00:01:39,674
He’s right to choose that one.

37
00:01:39,916 --> 00:01:41,056
What’s wrong with it?

38
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,922
I’ll continue.

39
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:44,568
My title is cool.

40
00:01:44,746 --> 00:01:45,678
The second comment.

41
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:50,488
He says it’s romantic and complete. It passes.

42
00:01:50,687 --> 00:01:52,540
It’s ready for filming.

43
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:57,648
Yeah!

44
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:01,599
We pass!

45
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,280
Awesome, Aou!

46
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,981
Damn right!

47
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:14,421
Friend Credits!

48
00:03:21,635 --> 00:03:23,635
See? I told you it’d work.

49
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:25,880
Aou’s prayer?

50
00:03:26,751 --> 00:03:27,739
No.

51
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,240
Kissing you.

52
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,422
It helped me improve my screenwriting so much.

53
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:46,407
What the heck are you doing, Tun?

54
00:03:47,004 --> 00:03:48,417
You said you weren’t messing with me.

55
00:03:48,564 --> 00:03:50,122
I’m not.

56
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:53,228
I kissed you because I felt like kissing you.

57
00:03:57,157 --> 00:03:58,521
Well.

58
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:02,740
If I were the female lead and got kissed like that,

59
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:04,402
I wouldn’t be captivated.

60
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:07,804
Yeah?

61
00:04:09,153 --> 00:04:10,542
Do you want to try it again?

62
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:32,555
Shit!

63
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,880
My brother said we got a director.

64
00:04:36,641 --> 00:04:37,460
Look.

65
00:04:39,829 --> 00:04:41,010
Let’s eat. It’s on me.

66
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,069
Get in.

67
00:04:44,403 --> 00:04:46,403
Woo-hoo.

68
00:04:46,591 --> 00:04:47,469
Quickly.

69
00:04:47,469 --> 00:04:48,591
What are you waiting for?

70
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,975
Chang?

71
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:55,160
I heard he’s funny, calm, and easy to talk to.

72
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,444
Should be an easy job for us.

73
00:04:57,632 --> 00:04:58,599
What’s that noise?

74
00:05:03,294 --> 00:05:04,327
I’m taking a nap.

75
00:05:04,327 --> 00:05:05,873
You guys go talk outside.

76
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:09,628
Are you in the wrong room?

77
00:05:09,837 --> 00:05:13,120
I booked this room for a meeting with Chang.

78
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,389
I am Chang!

79
00:05:17,495 --> 00:05:18,325
What?

80
00:05:19,376 --> 00:05:20,375
Aou.

81
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,082
Are you nuts?

82
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,279
He isn’t calm at all.

83
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,191
Polite. Nice. Friendly.

84
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,007
I don’t know.

85
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:25,507
Hey!

86
00:05:30,434 --> 00:05:31,445
I heard that.

87
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,680
That nice guy was me before I got married.

88
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:38,761
Since my marriage, I’ve been having a fight with my wife in Chiang Mai every damn day.

89
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,193
Long distance relationship. Just like in your screenplay.

90
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:43,148
Exactly.

91
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,656
Any comment on the screenplay?

92
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,073
Stop hitting the table.

93
00:05:59,204 --> 00:06:00,764
It’s okay overall.

94
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:04,533
I just want you to emphasize the love a bit more.

95
00:06:06,492 --> 00:06:07,488
How?

96
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:09,760
Make the dialogue more appealing

97
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:12,784
when the girl says she isn’t into love.

98
00:06:13,107 --> 00:06:15,767
The guy might say “Try to open your heart.”

99
00:06:16,034 --> 00:06:18,034
“You might find good love.”

100
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:19,770
Or…

101
00:06:29,178 --> 00:06:31,471
“Your soulmate might be closer than you think.”

102
00:06:31,997 --> 00:06:33,997
“Pay close attention to the person next to you.”

103
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:47,316
Got it?

104
00:06:47,766 --> 00:06:48,983
Got what?

105
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:52,179
You’re the one fixing it. Not me.

106
00:06:53,062 --> 00:06:55,062
Shh.

107
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:19,605
What are you reading?

108
00:07:21,787 --> 00:07:22,592
Nothing.

109
00:07:22,592 --> 00:07:23,787
Don’t lie.

110
00:07:23,877 --> 00:07:25,877
I saw you reading a Shoujo.

111
00:07:26,794 --> 00:07:29,160
So you like the genre?

112
00:07:31,296 --> 00:07:32,185
No.

113
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:36,328
Since I started reading it,

114
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:38,561
I just want to finish it.

115
00:07:38,757 --> 00:07:39,635
That’s all.

116
00:07:40,118 --> 00:07:42,118
Ah!

117
00:07:44,513 --> 00:07:47,173
What’s it about?

118
00:07:48,811 --> 00:07:50,713
It’s about a man

119
00:07:51,257 --> 00:07:53,526
who is very nosy.

120
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:55,434
You mean the comic book or me?

121
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,331
You.

122
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,023
Asshole.

123
00:07:58,317 --> 00:07:59,494
I want a serious answer.

124
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:03,446
Why are you so interested?

125
00:08:05,158 --> 00:08:06,364
I see you like it.

126
00:08:07,158 --> 00:08:08,808
So it has my attention.

127
00:08:16,788 --> 00:08:18,128
I’m gonna go pay.

128
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,887
What?

129
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:24,768
Thank you so much. Please come again.

130
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:26,164
Next, please.

131
00:08:28,045 --> 00:08:29,000
Only one, right?

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,703
Right.

133
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:33,256
A very cute comic book.

134
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,173
Are you Godji?

135
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:39,605
No.

136
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:42,996
You’re the third person asking me that in a month.

137
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:45,400
Why? Do I look very common?

138
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,547
Or that person looks common?

139
00:08:49,482 --> 00:08:51,678
Would you like to be our member?

140
00:08:51,957 --> 00:08:54,104
It’s free to join and you’ll get 10% off.

141
00:08:55,656 --> 00:08:57,120
Do you need an ID card?

142
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,642
No.

143
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:01,343
Just fill in your info in all the fields.

144
00:09:01,343 --> 00:09:02,616
Otherwise, I can’t process it for you.

145
00:09:02,616 --> 00:09:04,139
All right.

146
00:09:04,286 --> 00:09:05,032
Here.

147
00:09:05,032 --> 00:09:05,860
Thank you.

148
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:07,528
Hold on.

149
00:09:07,919 --> 00:09:10,280
My name is TamaGuaijeng.

150
00:09:11,956 --> 00:09:13,296
TamaGuaijeng?

151
00:09:13,894 --> 00:09:15,894
What’s the other person’s name?

152
00:09:16,419 --> 00:09:17,588
TamaGodji.

153
00:09:18,425 --> 00:09:19,760
What a terrible name.

154
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,967
Please step aside to make room for the next customer.

155
00:09:22,967 --> 00:09:23,587
Sure.

156
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:24,680
Thank you.

157
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:26,834
Hi.

158
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:28,002
Just one?

159
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:36,640
Can I fill in your information?

160
00:09:37,154 --> 00:09:37,916
Hey.

161
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:39,499
Why me?

162
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:41,095
Think about it.

163
00:09:41,324 --> 00:09:43,886
You will get to input your real information.

164
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:47,599
The evidence to show you’re really in this universe.

165
00:09:53,838 --> 00:09:55,058
What’s your first name?

166
00:09:58,237 --> 00:09:59,213
Rawi.

167
00:10:00,743 --> 00:10:01,766
Unique name.

168
00:10:01,766 --> 00:10:02,743
Last name?

169
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:04,773
Lertpanya.

170
00:10:07,414 --> 00:10:08,630
Date of birth.

171
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,960
September 11th, 1998.

172
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:14,059
You’re born before me.

173
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,662
Old man!

174
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:20,222
Come on. I bet I’m just a few months older.

175
00:10:21,491 --> 00:10:22,405
Which month were you born in?

176
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:24,616
Tricky question.

177
00:10:26,068 --> 00:10:26,807
Fine.

178
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,655
I won’t be tricky then.

179
00:10:30,216 --> 00:10:31,598
I’m being serious here.

180
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:34,295
What is your name?

181
00:10:49,583 --> 00:10:50,800
Read my lips.

182
00:10:54,036 --> 00:10:56,411
(Not telling you.)

183
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:58,649
Oh!

184
00:10:58,649 --> 00:11:00,042
Fine.

185
00:11:01,306 --> 00:11:03,746
(Up to you!)

186
00:11:06,511 --> 00:11:07,308
Come on.

187
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:08,804
Don’t be sulky.

188
00:11:10,513 --> 00:11:11,517
All right.

189
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:15,000
I’m telling you now.

190
00:11:15,503 --> 00:11:16,941
Read my lips closely.

191
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:21,519
(Rawi)

192
00:11:24,699 --> 00:11:26,430
Rawi is my name.

193
00:11:27,015 --> 00:11:28,313
Having fun, huh?

194
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:30,360
Rawi.

195
00:11:30,878 --> 00:11:31,754
What?

196
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,664
Rawi. Rawi. Rawi.

197
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:35,076
What are you doing?

198
00:11:35,550 --> 00:11:37,000
Stop bugging me.

199
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,718
(I like your name.)

200
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:12,310
Dol is calling.

201
00:12:15,342 --> 00:12:16,229
Hello.

202
00:12:18,129 --> 00:12:18,880
What?

203
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:21,156
At the association now?

204
00:12:29,378 --> 00:12:30,392
Dol, hello.

205
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:32,520
Hi.

206
00:12:33,273 --> 00:12:35,444
It’s nothing serious.

207
00:12:35,551 --> 00:12:37,551
I just want to introduce you guys to someone.

208
00:12:37,911 --> 00:12:39,214
A new member?

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,455
An old member.

210
00:12:41,455 --> 00:12:42,728
She just doesn’t come very often.

211
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,187
There she is.

212
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:06,644
Why do I feel like she’s giving familiar vibes?

213
00:13:07,694 --> 00:13:08,679
Do you have the same feeling?

214
00:13:09,694 --> 00:13:10,709
No.

215
00:13:11,296 --> 00:13:12,077
Yeah?

216
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:16,881
Maybe it’s just me who thinks she’s special.

217
00:13:29,311 --> 00:13:32,240
You two help with the blocking. Stand where marked as lead characters.

218
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,813
We must pretend we’re lovers.

219
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,880
Hold hands and walk in the snow like he said.

220
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,640
Got it, boyfriend?

221
00:14:11,168 --> 00:14:12,252
Hi.

222
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,778
Pang, these are the new guys.

223
00:14:17,778 --> 00:14:21,949
This is Talay and that one is anonymous but he’s the body of Tun.

224
00:14:23,292 --> 00:14:24,995
Nice to meet you.

225
00:14:24,995 --> 00:14:26,133
Both of you.

226
00:14:28,194 --> 00:14:30,194
She’s a yoga instructor.

227
00:14:30,194 --> 00:14:32,504
But in the other universe, she’s an actress.

228
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:33,603
Just like you, Tun.

229
00:14:33,603 --> 00:14:34,755
Don’t know if you guys have met.

230
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:55,714
Don’t tell me you are…

231
00:14:58,301 --> 00:14:59,632
Pang Piyada.

232
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:16,049
I am.

233
00:15:17,128 --> 00:15:18,658
Have we worked together?

234
00:15:21,965 --> 00:15:23,965
In that series

235
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,722
produced by Chod.

236
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,658
We had many scenes together.

237
00:15:31,296 --> 00:15:33,024
Hold on. I’m getting something.

238
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,051
So you are…

239
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:39,751
Hey! Let’s discuss it over there.

240
00:15:39,751 --> 00:15:41,224
I remember you.

241
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,613
How weird.

242
00:15:49,118 --> 00:15:51,192
He doesn’t want me to know his name.

243
00:15:52,524 --> 00:15:55,664
No. I mean it’s weird he’s smiling.

244
00:15:55,813 --> 00:15:58,804
He normally has no facial expression.

245
00:15:59,069 --> 00:16:00,215
But now he’s smiling widely.

246
00:16:00,298 --> 00:16:03,183
I think they’re pretty close.

247
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,389
The series crew got him a nickname. Solemn Face.

248
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,964
Because he always made a cold and solemn face on set.

249
00:16:16,964 --> 00:16:18,714
Pang, that’s enough.

250
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,578
Just eat. Don’t talk so much.

251
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:25,916
By the way, how am I doing in the other universe?

252
00:16:27,724 --> 00:16:29,352
You’ve had lots of work.

253
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,978
As for your love, you…

254
00:16:34,157 --> 00:16:35,637
Broke up with Ben.

255
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:37,673
You did.

256
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:42,312
But not long after that, you dated someone from the same company.

257
00:16:43,018 --> 00:16:44,197
A man four years younger.

258
00:16:44,258 --> 00:16:45,079
Oops!

259
00:16:45,441 --> 00:16:48,035
This yoga instructor is pretty hot.

260
00:16:48,528 --> 00:16:49,456
But that’s good.

261
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,311
I’ve always wanted to date younger boys.

262
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:57,120
Come by the association more often.

263
00:16:57,312 --> 00:16:59,312
Talay and I come from time to time.

264
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:01,057
I can’t.

265
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:04,126
I scheduled myself more acting classes to teach.

266
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:06,295
You want to help me teach?

267
00:17:07,132 --> 00:17:08,782
Oh, no.

268
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:11,200
My acting skills are gone.

269
00:17:11,546 --> 00:17:13,178
All I do these days is screenwriting.

270
00:17:13,878 --> 00:17:14,501
Right?

271
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:16,126
Don’t be modest.

272
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:16,999
I’m serious.

273
00:17:17,108 --> 00:17:19,182
When you’re free, come help me.

274
00:17:19,182 --> 00:17:21,012
I lost my skills. I only write screenplays these days.

275
00:17:21,012 --> 00:17:21,714
I don’t believe you.

276
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:22,381
It’s true.

277
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:23,342
Right, Talay?

278
00:17:35,034 --> 00:17:36,712
You’re in such a good mood.

279
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:40,538
The song is nice.

280
00:17:40,538 --> 00:17:41,610
Don’t.

281
00:17:42,211 --> 00:17:44,338
You’ve been hyped up since you met Pang.

282
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:50,737
Since you’ve met her, you might as well spend more time with her.

283
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,847
She's probably your portkey.

284
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,584
Why would you think that?

285
00:18:02,878 --> 00:18:03,714
I don’t know.

286
00:18:05,074 --> 00:18:06,306
I just have the feeling.

287
00:18:09,265 --> 00:18:11,265
You guys seem to get along well.

288
00:18:12,397 --> 00:18:14,149
You have many connections.

289
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:20,604
You said it yourself that she’s got something special.

290
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,328
Well, that’s true.

291
00:18:33,062 --> 00:18:37,110
But I don’t want to pinpoint she’s my portkey just yet.

292
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:54,631
Tun.

293
00:18:54,854 --> 00:18:55,617
Hm?

294
00:18:58,409 --> 00:19:04,768
If you found your portkey one day, would you go back immediately?

295
00:19:08,649 --> 00:19:09,722
Do you want me to wait?

296
00:19:10,762 --> 00:19:11,689
No.

297
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,750
I just want to know.

298
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,500
I don’t know.

299
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:36,227
But…

300
00:19:37,189 --> 00:19:39,338
if you have a chance to go back one day,

301
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,598
don’t wait for me.

302
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:47,672
Don’t throw away your dream just to wait for me.

303
00:19:54,512 --> 00:19:56,512
That answer means

304
00:19:57,756 --> 00:19:59,236
you won’t wait for me, right?

305
00:20:17,389 --> 00:20:18,993
Thanks for the ride.

306
00:20:23,659 --> 00:20:25,164
Bye. See you.

307
00:20:47,533 --> 00:20:48,369
Ahem!

308
00:20:55,873 --> 00:20:57,130
I’ll wait…

309
00:20:58,813 --> 00:20:59,798
to go back…

310
00:21:01,964 --> 00:21:03,658
with you.

311
00:21:30,222 --> 00:21:32,693
Honey, I’m at the movie set, working.

312
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,315
You’re being silly. I’ll talk to you later.

313
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:37,778
Bye-bye.

314
00:21:39,239 --> 00:21:40,178
Chang, hello.

315
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:42,073
Hello.

316
00:21:42,822 --> 00:21:45,218
Where are the other two?

317
00:21:45,409 --> 00:21:48,301
Up and Aou will come in the next queue.

318
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,079
We take turns.

319
00:21:50,079 --> 00:21:51,112
Okay. We’ll worry about that later.

320
00:21:51,803 --> 00:21:53,803
Chang. We got a problem.

321
00:21:54,885 --> 00:21:57,182
The weather forecast says it’ll be snowing in 10 minutes.

322
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,636
The weather forecast in this country is damn accurate.

323
00:22:01,309 --> 00:22:02,858
What a day!

324
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,863
Wait a minute.

325
00:22:05,482 --> 00:22:07,858
Snow in Thailand?

326
00:22:07,858 --> 00:22:09,185
Of course.

327
00:22:09,185 --> 00:22:11,012
Where do you want it then? Mars?

328
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:13,658
We’ve always had snow.

329
00:22:14,545 --> 00:22:16,545
Does anyone know any prayer that can get rid of snow?

330
00:22:17,212 --> 00:22:18,658
Or we must cancel the filming.

331
00:22:18,658 --> 00:22:19,601
Calm down.

332
00:22:19,601 --> 00:22:20,586
It’s all set.

333
00:22:21,159 --> 00:22:24,125
Why don’t we stick the lemongrass into the ground?

334
00:22:24,841 --> 00:22:26,346
Stick the lemongrass into the ground?

335
00:22:26,346 --> 00:22:28,098
It’s the tradition in my universe.

336
00:22:30,347 --> 00:22:31,299
No.

337
00:22:31,596 --> 00:22:32,867
It’s the tradition from overseas.

338
00:22:33,902 --> 00:22:35,580
I tried and it worked.

339
00:22:35,775 --> 00:22:38,320
Tess and I will do it for you.

340
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:39,658
One second.

341
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:41,252
Don’t cancel the movie set.

342
00:22:41,894 --> 00:22:42,602
Come on.

343
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,138
Which state did he get that tradition from?

344
00:22:45,138 --> 00:22:46,415
You do it.

345
00:22:46,938 --> 00:22:47,885
Wait.

346
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,433
Why me?

347
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:52,961
Because I’ll say the prayer.

348
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:54,479
Quickly. Before it snows.

349
00:22:58,025 --> 00:22:59,064
Right here?

350
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,297
Yeah.

351
00:23:06,907 --> 00:23:08,288
I’m done! Do it.

352
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:31,522
(Damn! I never imagined seeing snow in Thailand.)

353
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:36,408
(Yeah)

354
00:23:37,101 --> 00:23:38,760
(it’s my first snow in life.)

355
00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:43,981
(That means I’m the first one you see snow with.)

356
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,360
(Right, why?)

357
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:54,755
(When you see snow again next time, you will think of me.)

358
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,530
We’ve done everything.

359
00:24:01,136 --> 00:24:02,789
It isn’t stopping.

360
00:24:03,603 --> 00:24:04,785
There’s one more thing we can try.

361
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:05,603
Cancel the filming set?

362
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:06,867
We film anyways.

363
00:24:06,867 --> 00:24:07,686
Change the script.

364
00:24:07,686 --> 00:24:09,635
The lead characters will run under the snow.

365
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:11,488
You have a problem?

366
00:24:11,686 --> 00:24:12,646
No.

367
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:15,178
Just add the scene where they’re surprised to see the snow.

368
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:16,600
Prepare the cameras.

369
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,564
Sure.

370
00:24:18,035 --> 00:24:19,763
Guys, set the cameras.

371
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:23,049
As for you, Tun and Tess.

372
00:24:23,486 --> 00:24:25,486
Help with the blocking. Stand where marked as lead characters.

373
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:26,789
Wait.

374
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,783
Why us?

375
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,771
Just help.

376
00:24:30,771 --> 00:24:32,652
Look at my crew. I only have a few people.

377
00:24:33,118 --> 00:24:37,099
Besides, you two understand the characters the most.

378
00:24:37,557 --> 00:24:39,086
Help. Before it’s dark.

379
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:40,948
Go.

380
00:24:42,137 --> 00:24:43,054
Go on.

381
00:24:45,207 --> 00:24:46,124
Quickly.

382
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:47,900
Sure. Sure.

383
00:24:48,641 --> 00:24:50,069
Yes, that’s the blocking.

384
00:24:51,481 --> 00:24:53,985
A little left. Yes.

385
00:24:54,391 --> 00:24:55,211
Left.

386
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:56,540
Stand on the grass.

387
00:24:57,643 --> 00:24:58,509
Damn it.

388
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:00,708
We just stop by but he makes us work.

389
00:25:01,808 --> 00:25:03,313
Don’t go off the character.

390
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:06,351
We must pretend we’re lovers.

391
00:25:06,528 --> 00:25:09,568
Hold hands and walk in the snow like he said.

392
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:12,194
Got it, boyfriend?

393
00:25:13,135 --> 00:25:14,096
Goosebumps.

394
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,050
Do you have to be so serious?

395
00:25:16,422 --> 00:25:18,146
Of course.

396
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:22,445
So that the cameramen know the mood of the scene.

397
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:24,374
Okay,

398
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:26,613
let’s rehearse.

399
00:25:26,712 --> 00:25:27,667
Excited?

400
00:25:27,907 --> 00:25:29,610
Your first time?

401
00:25:29,808 --> 00:25:30,870
Hell yeah.

402
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,072
And…action!

403
00:26:16,050 --> 00:26:17,505
What the hell are you doing, Tun?

404
00:26:18,317 --> 00:26:19,467
Kissing your cheek.

405
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:22,670
Why are you surprised, boyfriend?

406
00:26:24,147 --> 00:26:27,088
It’s not real filming. You don’t have to be so into it.

407
00:26:27,838 --> 00:26:29,020
I’m not into it.

408
00:26:29,218 --> 00:26:31,002
I just wanted to kiss your cheek.

409
00:26:32,106 --> 00:26:35,295
Your cheeks give me cute aggression.

410
00:26:37,517 --> 00:26:38,514
Cute, my ass!

411
00:26:39,034 --> 00:26:40,938
I just want to kick your ass.

412
00:26:42,725 --> 00:26:44,725
You can’t kick me now.

413
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:47,136
Because we are boyfriends.

414
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,058
Hold on. Have we said cut?

415
00:26:55,853 --> 00:26:57,413
The dialogue ended a long time ago.

416
00:26:57,809 --> 00:26:59,300
They just keep on acting.

417
00:26:59,464 --> 00:27:00,721
I’ll just watch then.

418
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:21,707
Okay.

419
00:27:33,357 --> 00:27:37,115
This is the first movie I actually made.

420
00:27:37,767 --> 00:27:38,938
Don’t worry.

421
00:27:39,294 --> 00:27:41,170
Whatever happens,

422
00:27:41,531 --> 00:27:43,218
I’ll go through it with you.

423
00:28:16,573 --> 00:28:17,698
Are you being shy?

424
00:28:17,934 --> 00:28:19,255
You’re hiding here by yourself.

425
00:28:20,539 --> 00:28:21,456
Why would I?

426
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:25,789
It’s cold and I’m thirsty.

427
00:28:26,876 --> 00:28:29,295
I’m just here to have a drink.

428
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:32,135
Yeah?

429
00:28:32,712 --> 00:28:33,717
Yeah.

430
00:28:36,993 --> 00:28:37,906
Here.

431
00:28:38,261 --> 00:28:39,348
Want one?

432
00:29:11,262 --> 00:29:16,014
I dreamed to work on a movie set in a different country once in a lifetime.

433
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:20,580
Turns out it’s a movie set in a different universe.

434
00:29:21,756 --> 00:29:23,001
This is peak.

435
00:29:23,181 --> 00:29:26,141
By ‘peak,’ you mean good?

436
00:29:27,957 --> 00:29:29,302
Very good.

437
00:29:33,754 --> 00:29:35,361
But it’s a little too cold.

438
00:29:36,284 --> 00:29:38,127
I don’t like this kind of climate.

439
00:29:48,567 --> 00:29:50,567
- No!
- Don’t move.

440
00:29:50,939 --> 00:29:55,717
You’re cold and I’m keeping you warm.

441
00:29:56,048 --> 00:29:58,441
No. Let go.

442
00:29:58,441 --> 00:29:59,384
No.

443
00:30:02,748 --> 00:30:05,036
I don't want you to have any dislikes

444
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,078
right now.

445
00:30:21,134 --> 00:30:23,015
You must only be happy,

446
00:30:23,382 --> 00:30:24,392
Talay.

447
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:28,851
At least for five minutes.

448
00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:37,945
But you’re giving me one more thing I don’t like.

449
00:30:39,014 --> 00:30:40,595
I don’t like getting hugged.

450
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:45,374
Back to your seat.

451
00:30:51,326 --> 00:30:52,444
Well then.

452
00:30:53,261 --> 00:30:54,798
You can hug me instead.

453
00:30:55,246 --> 00:30:57,927
I like to hug

454
00:30:58,262 --> 00:30:59,502
and get hugged.

455
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:05,397
No.

456
00:31:06,105 --> 00:31:07,399
I’m not cold anymore.

457
00:31:11,718 --> 00:31:12,676
That.

458
00:31:13,261 --> 00:31:14,539
Won’t you drink it?

459
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:16,558
Drink up.

460
00:31:17,004 --> 00:31:18,585
It’s 0% of sugar.

461
00:31:19,112 --> 00:31:20,640
Your body will stay in good shape.

462
00:31:21,158 --> 00:31:22,231
You told me that yourself.

463
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:53,861
What are you doing?

464
00:31:54,296 --> 00:31:55,354
This is great.

465
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,742
Wanna try?

466
00:32:16,583 --> 00:32:17,400
Like it?

467
00:32:22,249 --> 00:32:23,432
Cold?

468
00:32:24,857 --> 00:32:26,018
No.

469
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:28,606
Stop it.

470
00:32:28,606 --> 00:32:29,544
Stop.

471
00:32:29,544 --> 00:32:30,667
Don’t.

472
00:32:31,817 --> 00:32:33,057
Tun!

473
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:35,453
Are you cold?

474
00:32:35,926 --> 00:32:37,035
Tun!

475
00:32:37,868 --> 00:32:39,868
Here, get colder.

476
00:32:39,868 --> 00:32:41,199
Feel the coldness.

477
00:32:42,302 --> 00:32:44,302
Very nice poster.
[TWO MONTHS LATER]

478
00:32:44,302 --> 00:32:45,260
When will it come out?

479
00:32:45,766 --> 00:32:48,657
Next week. But the premiere press conference is tomorrow.

480
00:32:48,657 --> 00:32:50,756
It’d be nice if you can spread the word.

481
00:32:50,756 --> 00:32:53,140
Absolutely. I’ll be your big promoter.

482
00:32:53,351 --> 00:32:55,501
Can I get a ticket to the premiere though?

483
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:57,830
I want to see movie stars up close.

484
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,557
I can’t take it anymore.

485
00:33:01,631 --> 00:33:04,129
Why does this happen to me?

486
00:33:08,262 --> 00:33:09,661
Calm down.

487
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:11,444
I know what you’re going through.

488
00:33:12,272 --> 00:33:13,861
I’ve lost everything.

489
00:33:13,861 --> 00:33:15,171
I’m jobless.

490
00:33:15,171 --> 00:33:16,174
My wife left me.

491
00:33:22,907 --> 00:33:24,330
What’s happening?

492
00:33:26,056 --> 00:33:29,314
Uncle Sak is actually a citizen of this universe.

493
00:33:29,314 --> 00:33:30,922
He traveled to the other one.

494
00:33:31,072 --> 00:33:32,626
And he got back.

495
00:33:33,108 --> 00:33:36,628
But he was back just to find out he lost his house and his job.

496
00:33:36,628 --> 00:33:38,013
That’s why he’s devastated.

497
00:33:40,464 --> 00:33:42,045
This can’t be true.

498
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:45,021
How long do I need to live this life?

499
00:33:45,829 --> 00:33:47,492
Before I traveled there,

500
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:53,726
I applied for Senior Architect in a big company.

501
00:33:54,946 --> 00:33:56,710
I got accepted.

502
00:33:57,428 --> 00:33:58,799
Just like me.

503
00:34:00,051 --> 00:34:03,440
Not long after I started working, it happened.

504
00:34:04,939 --> 00:34:06,493
I traveled to the other universe.

505
00:34:08,262 --> 00:34:09,424
For how long?

506
00:34:12,491 --> 00:34:13,539
Five years.

507
00:34:15,712 --> 00:34:17,490
When I got back here,

508
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:20,648
I became an AC repairman.

509
00:34:22,189 --> 00:34:23,717
I broke up with my wife.

510
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,456
My house was sold.

511
00:34:27,563 --> 00:34:33,494
What burns the most is that the man who was in my body caused huge trouble.

512
00:34:34,403 --> 00:34:38,701
No architectural firms want to hire me now.

513
00:34:42,865 --> 00:34:47,486
I hope you guys can go home quickly

514
00:34:48,688 --> 00:34:50,688
before it’s too late.

515
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:19,435
What’s the matter?

516
00:35:20,012 --> 00:35:21,385
Thinking about the uncle’s story?

517
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:22,932
Yes.

518
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:25,576
I get him so well.

519
00:35:26,923 --> 00:35:31,098
I’m afraid Tess would ruin my job too.

520
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,070
I get you.

521
00:35:35,924 --> 00:35:38,822
Aren’t you worried at all?

522
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:42,439
Pakorn might destroy your acting career.

523
00:35:46,128 --> 00:35:47,328
I am.

524
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,894
But what can I do?

525
00:35:55,493 --> 00:35:58,148
All we can do now is trust them.

526
00:35:59,034 --> 00:36:01,034
Just like them who have to trust us too.

527
00:36:06,243 --> 00:36:07,375
Thank you.

528
00:36:09,026 --> 00:36:12,489
And thank you for always giving me a ride.

529
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:14,594
Yeah.

530
00:36:14,725 --> 00:36:16,141
Don’t need to thank me.

531
00:36:16,673 --> 00:36:20,770
I told you my bike is fuel-efficient.

532
00:36:22,098 --> 00:36:23,208
Just tell me where you want to go.

533
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:24,671
Yeah?

534
00:36:25,925 --> 00:36:27,097
Then…

535
00:36:28,905 --> 00:36:30,572
can you give me a ride to the other universe?

536
00:36:37,669 --> 00:36:38,893
That must be difficult.

537
00:36:38,893 --> 00:36:39,774
Right.

538
00:36:43,227 --> 00:36:45,227
Because if we’re really there,

539
00:36:46,276 --> 00:36:47,961
I won’t be just the guy who gave you a ride.

540
00:36:48,753 --> 00:36:50,541
I’ll be the guy who lives with you.

541
00:36:58,822 --> 00:37:00,141
Are you going anywhere today?

542
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:02,734
No.

543
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:04,196
Why?

544
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:06,894
Hop on then.

545
00:37:07,706 --> 00:37:09,968
Sugar daddy will take you on a stress-relieving ride.

546
00:37:11,888 --> 00:37:13,261
I just took it off.

547
00:37:14,025 --> 00:37:15,370
Put it back on.

548
00:37:50,941 --> 00:37:52,574
This might go big.

549
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,741
Hello.

550
00:38:00,539 --> 00:38:02,539
Congratulations!

551
00:38:02,539 --> 00:38:04,019
Thank you.

552
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:06,128
Your movie has finally come out.

553
00:38:06,496 --> 00:38:08,496
Thank you for the tickets.

554
00:38:08,496 --> 00:38:09,565
- Of course.
- Here.

555
00:38:10,054 --> 00:38:12,054
Thank you guys for coming.

556
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:13,972
I hope you enjoy the movie.

557
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,474
Can I get a picture with you two?

558
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:16,955
Absolutely. Come on.

559
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:18,430
Excuse me.

560
00:38:19,478 --> 00:38:20,309
A photo, please.

561
00:38:24,901 --> 00:38:26,036
Thank you.

562
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:27,694
Sure. Should we get inside?

563
00:38:27,694 --> 00:38:30,025
Yes, we will see you inside the theater.

564
00:38:30,025 --> 00:38:30,574
Okay.

565
00:38:30,934 --> 00:38:31,918
Good job.

566
00:38:31,918 --> 00:38:32,934
See you.

567
00:38:33,098 --> 00:38:34,233
Well done.

568
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:41,075
Guys.

569
00:38:42,317 --> 00:38:44,867
The short-haired woman in an orange suit, who is she?

570
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:45,567
Is she single?

571
00:38:45,567 --> 00:38:46,684
She’s my type.

572
00:38:47,017 --> 00:38:49,017
Come on, Up.

573
00:38:49,552 --> 00:38:51,552
You better not.

574
00:38:51,552 --> 00:38:52,296
Trust me.

575
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,826
Why not?

576
00:38:54,088 --> 00:38:55,661
Just no.

577
00:39:01,876 --> 00:39:03,261
Holy shit!

578
00:39:03,903 --> 00:39:05,274
That’s Gun Atthaphan.

579
00:39:06,669 --> 00:39:08,669
He’s an actor here too?

580
00:39:10,941 --> 00:39:12,301
Gun, my ass.

581
00:39:12,562 --> 00:39:13,854
That’s Third.

582
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:15,450
He owns Movie Seer Page.

583
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:17,169
The film criticism page.

584
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:18,591
Yeah?

585
00:39:18,591 --> 00:39:19,299
Yeah.

586
00:39:20,712 --> 00:39:22,817
But isn’t Khai here with him?

587
00:39:23,842 --> 00:39:25,056
Whatever.

588
00:39:25,166 --> 00:39:26,825
He isn’t an actor.

589
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:27,912
You’re delusional.

590
00:39:27,912 --> 00:39:29,157
You’re nuts.

591
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,463
Check your brains.

592
00:39:31,673 --> 00:39:32,782
You too.

593
00:39:38,414 --> 00:39:40,702
This universe is so unpredictable.

594
00:39:53,879 --> 00:39:55,119
I’m nervous.

595
00:39:56,366 --> 00:39:57,894
You’re an actor.

596
00:39:58,424 --> 00:39:59,926
You went to many movie premieres.

597
00:40:00,102 --> 00:40:01,861
It’s different.

598
00:40:01,992 --> 00:40:05,842
This is the first movie I actually made.

599
00:40:18,685 --> 00:40:19,753
Don’t worry.

600
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:22,572
Whatever happens,

601
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,206
I’ll go through it with you.

602
00:41:18,377 --> 00:41:21,163
(The movie is hilarious. I laughed so hard I cried.)

603
00:41:21,319 --> 00:41:26,228
(Right. And I just want to fall in love again after seeing it.)

604
00:41:28,147 --> 00:41:29,104
Excuse me.

605
00:41:29,628 --> 00:41:30,828
Excuse me.

606
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,139
Third!

607
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:36,341
I’ve never seen you so close.

608
00:41:36,805 --> 00:41:39,015
Are you guys on the screenwriting team?

609
00:41:39,256 --> 00:41:41,256
We are.

610
00:41:41,536 --> 00:41:43,143
The movie is really cute.

611
00:41:43,143 --> 00:41:45,624
I like every character. They’re all charming.

612
00:41:46,608 --> 00:41:48,608
You guys are great. I’m rooting for you.

613
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:50,516
Thank you.

614
00:41:50,516 --> 00:41:51,416
Excuse me.

615
00:41:51,758 --> 00:41:52,736
Hold on, Third.

616
00:41:54,025 --> 00:41:55,160
Thank you so much.

617
00:42:05,427 --> 00:42:07,846
He complimented us.

618
00:42:08,575 --> 00:42:10,051
Our movie will be a big hit.

619
00:42:10,051 --> 00:42:10,565
Right!

620
00:42:10,565 --> 00:42:14,420
He gave positive feedback. I just want to scream right now.

621
00:42:14,813 --> 00:42:15,832
Zip it for now.

622
00:42:20,063 --> 00:42:22,063
Friend Credits.

623
00:42:24,483 --> 00:42:26,483
To our first movie ever.

624
00:42:26,483 --> 00:42:30,296
Cheers!

625
00:42:35,444 --> 00:42:36,396
Guys.

626
00:42:37,724 --> 00:42:39,724
Should we check the feedback from movie review pages?

627
00:42:40,007 --> 00:42:43,261
Good.

628
00:42:43,261 --> 00:42:44,187
Let me do it.

629
00:42:52,491 --> 00:42:53,914
Hey. Don’t take a peek.

630
00:42:53,914 --> 00:42:54,592
I’ll read it first.

631
00:42:54,592 --> 00:42:56,014
Quickly, Tun.

632
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:20,360
If this movie was aired in our universe,

633
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:22,023
it would make millions by now.

634
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:24,941
If it wasn’t for you, this movie wouldn’t have happened.

635
00:43:25,274 --> 00:43:26,514
Thank you.

636
00:44:09,844 --> 00:44:10,854
In general,

637
00:44:11,844 --> 00:44:14,225
many pages say the same thing.

638
00:44:17,216 --> 00:44:18,446
The movie could’ve been better.

639
00:44:24,412 --> 00:44:25,518
Just put it back.

640
00:44:29,102 --> 00:44:30,199
Guys!

641
00:44:30,572 --> 00:44:31,823
I forgot to show you.

642
00:44:32,363 --> 00:44:33,966
I just put up the new lighting.

643
00:44:34,119 --> 00:44:35,234
Wanna see?

644
00:44:36,699 --> 00:44:37,584
Look.

645
00:44:40,181 --> 00:44:41,229
How is it?

646
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:42,327
Blue tone.

647
00:44:42,434 --> 00:44:43,739
Deep, isn’t it?

648
00:44:43,896 --> 00:44:45,598
So deep.

649
00:44:46,318 --> 00:44:49,436
Our sadness is really deep.

650
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,488
Easy there, man.

651
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:52,251
What is it?

652
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:53,256
What’s happening?

653
00:44:53,295 --> 00:44:54,898
Movie criticism pages.

654
00:44:55,350 --> 00:44:57,775
They didn’t give us very positive feedback.

655
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,151
Come on, guys.

656
00:44:59,623 --> 00:45:01,151
Don’t be so sad.

657
00:45:01,558 --> 00:45:04,495
I’ll treat you guys to frozen beer.

658
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,055
Interested?

659
00:45:07,271 --> 00:45:09,055
Don’t leave until you’re drunk.

660
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,060
Okay?

661
00:45:11,947 --> 00:45:12,815
All right.

662
00:45:13,287 --> 00:45:14,815
Let’s get deeply sad.

663
00:45:15,163 --> 00:45:16,691
Be miserable.

664
00:45:17,016 --> 00:45:19,175
And tomorrow we will fight again.

665
00:45:19,812 --> 00:45:22,036
I agree with Up.

666
00:45:22,394 --> 00:45:23,972
So what if they give us negative feedback?

667
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:26,895
I think there must be someone who likes it.

668
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,227
Though no one here likes it,

669
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,667
there must be someone in the alternate universe who loves it.

670
00:45:33,714 --> 00:45:35,341
We gave it our all.

671
00:45:35,565 --> 00:45:36,350
True.

672
00:45:36,350 --> 00:45:37,895
We just live in the wrong universe.

673
00:45:37,895 --> 00:45:41,992
Cheers!

674
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:45,107
Did you finish it?

675
00:45:45,107 --> 00:45:45,906
How many more would you like?

676
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:47,615
Four more.

677
00:45:47,615 --> 00:45:50,636
Cheers!

678
00:46:05,826 --> 00:46:11,327
Friend Credits!

679
00:46:15,909 --> 00:46:19,002
It’s such a pity that Long Distance Relationship,

680
00:46:19,002 --> 00:46:23,246
a romantic comedy film by 26 Pictures, falls short of its aim.

681
00:46:23,246 --> 00:46:25,665
Many theaters have opted to shorten their showtimes.

682
00:46:48,091 --> 00:46:49,147
Talay.

683
00:47:10,638 --> 00:47:11,769
Wow!

684
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:16,187
It’s like we bought the whole cinema just for us.

685
00:47:17,488 --> 00:47:18,619
Us?

686
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:21,576
Look. There are a bunch of people.

687
00:47:29,273 --> 00:47:30,379
Excuse me.

688
00:47:30,536 --> 00:47:31,915
Please watch your feet.

689
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:35,938
What are you doing?

690
00:47:36,089 --> 00:47:37,394
Shh.

691
00:47:37,617 --> 00:47:38,698
Be quiet.

692
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,542
Don’t bother other people.

693
00:47:40,542 --> 00:47:41,617
This cinema is full of people.

694
00:47:43,134 --> 00:47:44,339
Follow me.

695
00:47:53,051 --> 00:47:54,008
Shit!

696
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:58,081
I just stepped on this girl’s foot.

697
00:47:59,234 --> 00:48:00,414
It’s okay.

698
00:48:02,811 --> 00:48:04,415
Sorry about my boyfriend.

699
00:48:04,415 --> 00:48:06,638
He’s so clumsy.

700
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:07,701
Sorry about that.

701
00:48:09,359 --> 00:48:10,909
Boyfriend, my foot.

702
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:11,885
What are you doing?

703
00:48:12,138 --> 00:48:13,695
Shh.

704
00:48:16,444 --> 00:48:17,550
Come on.

705
00:48:43,983 --> 00:48:44,759
(Tun.)

706
00:48:46,969 --> 00:48:48,988
(Which scene is your favorite?)

707
00:48:50,825 --> 00:48:55,408
(The last scene where both of them meet again in the coffee shop.)

708
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:58,575
(Why?)

709
00:49:00,019 --> 00:49:01,895
(I went there with you.)

710
00:49:07,010 --> 00:49:09,407
(If this movie was aired in our universe)

711
00:49:09,856 --> 00:49:11,732
(it would make millions by now.)

712
00:49:13,266 --> 00:49:15,564
(It all started with the good screenplay you wrote.)

713
00:49:16,847 --> 00:49:18,251
(It’s you.)

714
00:49:19,452 --> 00:49:22,793
(If it wasn’t for you, this movie wouldn’t have happened.)

715
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,066
(Without you)

716
00:49:28,586 --> 00:49:30,362
( my screenplay wouldn’t be this good.)

717
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:36,528
Thank you.

718
00:49:42,509 --> 00:49:43,621
Thank you too.

719
00:49:46,055 --> 00:49:47,713
We are so great.

720
00:50:01,313 --> 00:50:02,593
Tun! Tess!

721
00:50:04,748 --> 00:50:06,326
What brought you guys here?

722
00:50:06,827 --> 00:50:07,895
I came to see the movie.

723
00:50:08,157 --> 00:50:10,033
Ah!

724
00:50:10,033 --> 00:50:14,193
So the guys sitting in front of me snuggling were you two.

725
00:50:14,930 --> 00:50:16,930
You guys were in the same cinema?

726
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:18,402
Yeah.

727
00:50:19,644 --> 00:50:21,172
I came to say my farewell too.

728
00:50:22,141 --> 00:50:28,065
It should be the first and the last movie I made.

729
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:30,429
Why are you saying that?

730
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:40,251
I…

731
00:50:46,658 --> 00:50:48,484
I think I will quit writing screenplays.

732
00:50:49,039 --> 00:50:49,829
Hey!

733
00:50:52,213 --> 00:50:53,125
For real?

734
00:50:55,038 --> 00:50:55,898
Yeah.

735
00:50:57,636 --> 00:50:59,273
I’ve been thinking about it.

736
00:51:01,906 --> 00:51:03,583
Look at us.

737
00:51:04,750 --> 00:51:08,538
The movie aired for only two weeks and it was out.

738
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:13,053
Who would want to hire us?

739
00:51:14,642 --> 00:51:18,008
I think I might help out my family's fishery business.

740
00:51:18,555 --> 00:51:20,033
They keep calling me.

741
00:51:21,598 --> 00:51:22,615
Me too.

742
00:51:23,306 --> 00:51:25,207
I will help my mom with her store.

743
00:51:25,604 --> 00:51:26,859
She wants me home too.

744
00:51:28,443 --> 00:51:30,691
So you’re both quitting?

745
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:33,645
I guess so.

746
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,250
And you, Tun?

747
00:51:36,795 --> 00:51:37,793
What are you gonna do?

748
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:42,992
I’m not sure.

749
00:51:47,302 --> 00:51:48,306
You, Tess?

750
00:51:51,112 --> 00:51:52,754
I gave my dad a promise.

751
00:51:54,372 --> 00:51:55,801
If this movie fails,

752
00:51:58,136 --> 00:51:59,987
I will go back to study and graduate.

753
00:52:02,292 --> 00:52:03,770
Then help with my family business.

754
00:52:04,342 --> 00:52:05,473
Damn.

755
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:10,058
We’re all going separate ways, huh?

756
00:52:11,399 --> 00:52:13,250
I must miss you guys so bad.

757
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:18,280
But it’s life to meet and part.

758
00:52:19,299 --> 00:52:21,423
I’m so proud to work with you guys.

759
00:52:21,799 --> 00:52:22,531
Come on.

760
00:52:22,779 --> 00:52:23,695
A group hug.

761
00:52:31,954 --> 00:52:33,333
I love you guys.

762
00:52:57,252 --> 00:52:58,148
Guys.

763
00:52:59,539 --> 00:53:01,115
Since we won’t get to meet soon.

764
00:53:01,955 --> 00:53:03,334
How about we take a selfie?

765
00:53:07,134 --> 00:53:07,895
Let’s do it.

766
00:53:25,512 --> 00:53:27,095
Thank you guys so much.

767
00:53:28,931 --> 00:53:30,633
Thank you guys too.

768
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:33,151
Bye now.

769
00:53:35,735 --> 00:53:36,729
Come here.

770
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:44,112
See you.

771
00:53:44,112 --> 00:53:44,942
Good luck with life.

772
00:53:47,306 --> 00:53:48,908
See you.

773
00:54:05,439 --> 00:54:08,333
What are you gonna do now?

774
00:54:12,122 --> 00:54:13,824
I’m moving back home.

775
00:54:17,659 --> 00:54:18,448
Why?

776
00:54:19,864 --> 00:54:21,572
The condo rent is pricey.

777
00:54:22,587 --> 00:54:27,269
If I stop writing screenplays, I won’t be able to cover it.

778
00:54:39,774 --> 00:54:40,855
Actually,

779
00:54:41,575 --> 00:54:42,895
there’s another way out.

780
00:54:46,977 --> 00:54:48,182
Which is?

781
00:54:57,896 --> 00:54:59,399
Find someone to share it with.

782
00:55:18,768 --> 00:55:19,619
Talay,

783
00:55:20,886 --> 00:55:22,606
would you like to move in with me?

784
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:49,335
Directed by Nuttapong Mongkolsawas

785
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:10,295
You are so colorful.

786
00:56:10,295 --> 00:56:12,375
You’re making my room a lot livelier.

787
00:56:12,375 --> 00:56:13,912
Not my room, actually.

788
00:56:14,489 --> 00:56:15,496
Our room.

789
00:56:15,976 --> 00:56:17,752
Tun, whose RV is that?

790
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:19,325
It belongs to a friend of my dad.

791
00:56:19,325 --> 00:56:21,376
Should we renovate it into a studio?

792
00:56:21,376 --> 00:56:21,935
What?

793
00:56:21,935 --> 00:56:23,095
It’s an RV.

794
00:56:23,095 --> 00:56:24,841
It’s been my dream.

795
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:26,617
This picture is missing something.

796
00:56:26,617 --> 00:56:27,579
What?

797
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:32,290
Someone who’s willing to walk with you for the rest of your life.
