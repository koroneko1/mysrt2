nothing you do matters?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.433
You leave footprints
on the beach,

03:04.520 --> 03:05.839
and tomorrow they're gone.

03:07.080 --> 03:08.718

over again.

and having fun...

03:15.040 --> 03:17.429

04:11.280 --> 04:13.635
Grandpa, did you take
your pills today?

04:13.800 --> 04:17.509
The key to my gun cabinet,
it was in the drawer.

04:17.680 --> 04:18.999
And now it's gone.

04:19.720 --> 04:22.359
Yeah, Dad took it,
all right?

04:22.520 --> 04:25.637
For safekeeping. It's okay.

My grandpa told me stories

about monsters that
he fought in the war.

09:20.640 --> 09:21.640
So there you go.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.518
He was
brutally attacked...

09:23.680 --> 09:26.990
and in your head, the man who
did it was inhuman, a monster.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.195
scratched up
the screen door...

09:34.360 --> 09:37.318
and he chased them off
into the woods.

09:37.480 --> 09:39.675
And the coroner said
he had a heart attack.

09:40.240 --> 09:41.832
And the cops said...

11:31.320 --> 11:34.198

Miss Peregrine...

11:34.360 --> 11:36.237
was very clever.

11:36.400 --> 11:38.868
And she smoked a pipe.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.189
She could turn into a bird.

11:40.360 --> 11:41.509
Mmm-hmm.

11:41.800 --> 11:45.679
It was a home
for special children...

11:45.840 --> 11:49.071
like Bronwyn and Victor.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.799
They were both as strong
as 10 men.

living inside him.

12:00.800 --> 12:02.552
She could float.

12:03.320 --> 12:06.630
She was lighter than air.

12:06.800 --> 12:10.031
She had to wear special
shoes made of lead

12:10.120 --> 12:11.951
to keep her
from floating away.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.711

She's still on the island,
I believe.

sent me there...

12:20.640 --> 12:22.915

call me Tygrysku.

for "little tiger."

in Poland, it wasn't safe.

12:46.920 --> 12:50.708
Huge ones,
with long arms...

12:50.880 --> 12:52.791
and no eyes...

found them

13:22.840 --> 13:25.229
when you went traveling.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.868
I would never lie
to you, Tygrysku.

13:28.040 --> 13:33.478
But you did, about the
home, the monsters.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.113
Dad told me.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.596
Your father knows very well

13:38.680 --> 13:40.875
I went to live
in the children's home.

13:41.760 --> 13:44.991
He said there really were
monsters in Poland...

13:45.280 --> 13:48.272
just not the kind
with tentacles.

13:48.960 --> 13:52.157
He said you got sent to Wales
'cause there were bad people.

13:52.720 --> 13:56.599
People who wanted to kill
anyone who was different.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.716
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

were special...

Never seemed
to pick a job...

16:51.760 --> 16:53.557
We should so love to see you.

16:53.720 --> 16:55.073
With admiration...

16:55.280 --> 16:56.429
Alma Peregrine.

16:56.800 --> 16:58.916
H mm. Only two years ago.

16:59.120 --> 17:02.078
I suppose it's possible
she could still be alive.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.789
Right.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.516
I could meet her.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.113
Maybe even find out
what it was

17:08.200 --> 17:09.598
Grandpa wanted me to know.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.079
But what if
she's dead?

17:11.240 --> 17:12.240
Dr. Golan...

17:12.400 --> 17:13.594
we are very concerned

17:13.720 --> 17:15.472
with Jake's state of mind
right now.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.016
There's no way I'm putting
my life on hold

17:17.040 --> 17:18.108
to take you to Wales.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.913
Dad could take me.

17:21.079 --> 17:23.674
And he can look at birds...

17:23.839 --> 17:24.989
and work on his book.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.670
It means you get a break.

17:27.839 --> 17:29.193
As Dr. Golan said...

17:29.400 --> 17:31.595
maybe I can move on.

17:32.480 --> 17:33.708
Like, closure.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.393
Having an opportunity
to see this children's home...

17:37.560 --> 17:39.676
and separate fantasy
from reality...

17:40.280 --> 17:41.633
may be helpful.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.153
And at the very least...

17:43.320 --> 17:45.880
a trip like this provides
a chance to...

17:46.720 --> 17:48.199
say goodbye.

17:54.600 --> 17:57.114
JAKE: "Cairnholm.
Population of 92.

17:57.680 --> 17:59.557
"Best known
for its proximity...

17:59.760 --> 18:02.718
"to the final resting place
of the cruise liner Augusta...

18:02.880 --> 18:05.235
"which sank in 1915.

18:05.920 --> 18:07.717
"There is just one hotel..."

18:08.360 --> 18:09.429
That's us.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.477
Yeah. I hope there's bourbon.

18:11.560 --> 18:13.596
(SCREECHING)

18:13.960 --> 18:15.518
Oh, wow!

18:15.840 --> 18:17.398
Jake, check it out.

18:17.560 --> 18:19.676
That's a peregrine falcon.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.308
A peregrine,
like the headmistress?

18:23.080 --> 18:24.399
Sure.

18:24.560 --> 18:26.198
That's probably
where Grandpa came up

18:26.280 --> 18:28.032
with that whole turning
into a bird thing.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.678
Or maybe,
maybe that's really her!

18:31.880 --> 18:33.359
(SHOUTING)
Hey, Miss Peregrine.

18:33.520 --> 18:34.919
It's me, Jake.

18:35.080 --> 18:37.275
I'm Abe Portman's grandson.

18:37.440 --> 18:39.590
Please don't crap on us.

18:41.760 --> 18:44.069
Oh, my God.
Dad, I'm kidding.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.430
What the... Hello?

19:14.440 --> 19:15.589
Hello?

19:20.200 --> 19:21.792
Anybody home?

19:30.000 --> 19:31.558
(LAUGHS)

19:33.000 --> 19:34.000
Oh, hey.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.435
Any idea where I'd find
the manager of this place?

19:36.600 --> 19:38.636
That's me.
Sorry to keep you.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.677
Just helping Uncle Oggie
to the loo.

19:40.760 --> 19:41.988
Oh. Oh.

19:42.080 --> 19:43.832
KEV: I'm Kev.
There's room upstairs.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.000
Oh, great.

19:45.160 --> 19:46.195
I'll be back in a bit.

19:46.280 --> 19:47.315
Okay.

19:48.160 --> 19:50.151
FRANK: Kev's just getting
our suite ready.

19:51.160 --> 19:52.513
Um, while we're waiting...

19:52.680 --> 19:55.274
I thought maybe we could go
check out the beach.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.351
I thought we would go
to the children's home.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.795
Is the beach
where the birds nest?

19:59.960 --> 20:02.349
I thought we could just
check it out real quick.

20:02.520 --> 20:05.114
I could go to the home
by myself.

20:05.280 --> 20:08.909
Then, you can really
take your time and enjoy it.

20:09.080 --> 20:11.514
Come on, Jakey. You know
your mom would freak.

20:12.600 --> 20:14.909
What if we can find
someone to take me?

20:16.800 --> 20:17.869
FRANK: Hey, dudes.

20:18.600 --> 20:19.919
Dad. Don't.
Shh! I got this.

20:20.080 --> 20:21.720
I was just wondering
if any of you guys...

20:21.760 --> 20:23.216
might be interested
in taking my son here

20:23.240 --> 20:25.310
to the other side
of the island.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.473
So, what are your names?

20:41.640 --> 20:43.631
I'm Worm.
This is MC Dirty D.

20:43.840 --> 20:45.034
MC Dirty Bizniz.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.235
I thought you changed it.

20:46.320 --> 20:47.320
No.

20:47.400 --> 20:48.674
No, you did, remember?

20:48.840 --> 20:50.193
When Ruth said
"MC Dirty Bizniz"

20:50.280 --> 20:52.000
made it sound like
you cacked your trousers.

20:52.160 --> 20:54.037
Yeah, but she said
"Dirty D" sounded like

20:54.120 --> 20:55.189
a personal
hygiene problem.

20:55.360 --> 20:57.999
Wait. Are these, like,
nicknames, or...

20:58.160 --> 21:00.958
Stage names. We're the
sickest rappers in Wales.

21:01.120 --> 21:03.315
Go on, Worm. Show this
Yank how it's done.

21:03.480 --> 21:04.480
What? Now?

21:04.560 --> 21:05.595
(BEATBOXING)

21:05.680 --> 21:07.320

down the Priest Hole

21:07.440 --> 21:09.240
Your dad's always here
'cause he's on the dole

21:09.360 --> 21:11.237
Our rhymes are tight
Yet I make it look easy

21:11.400 --> 21:13.470

21:15.400 --> 21:17.516
Oh, yeah, no.
It's good.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.231
WORM: Should we take
the shortcut, D?

21:20.400 --> 21:22.516
We'll get there quicker.
Take it from me.

21:23.800 --> 21:24.994
What, down here?
Mm-hmm.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.160
Yeah.

over a lost shoe, boy-o.

22:31.680 --> 22:34.114
The children's home.
What happened to it?

22:34.280 --> 22:37.989
A German air raid.
Bomb fell right on the roof.

22:38.160 --> 22:41.232
September the 3rd, 1943.

22:41.400 --> 22:43.356
Where did they go after?

22:43.440 --> 22:45.510
The headmistress
and the children.

22:46.160 --> 22:49.118
Not one survivor.
Poor little buggers.

22:50.040 --> 22:52.474
And they were lovely, too.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.636
Why didn't he tell us that
they all died?

22:56.800 --> 22:58.640
He leaves to join the army,
and 3 months later,

22:58.680 --> 23:00.875
everyone he knows
gets killed?

23:01.800 --> 23:04.951
Not even Grandpa could turn
that into a bedtime story.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.872
Well, no wonder he was
scared of being a dad...

23:09.040 --> 23:10.678
being close to anyone.

23:12.640 --> 23:13.789
Listen.

23:14.920 --> 23:17.115
You need to talk about all
this with someone, buddy.

you're all dead.

Oh, my God. Am I dead?

26:24.320 --> 26:25.320
No.

You called me Abe.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.996

26:32.160 --> 26:33.229
You looked like him.

Please, Jake.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.910
Factoring in some sort
of kerfuffle at the pub...

31:32.080 --> 31:34.196
and the return journey
with your added weight...

31:34.360 --> 31:37.318
you would arrive here
at 13 minutes past 4.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.509
Now, then,
do you take sugar?

31:41.160 --> 31:42.736
That'll do. Thank you, Olive.
(WHISTLING)

31:42.760 --> 31:45.194
Nobody enjoys
over-boiled tea.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.355
Let me help you
with those, Enoch.

31:57.560 --> 32:00.120
Don't bother. Wouldn't want
to interrupt your tea party.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.316
I'm so sorry
for your loss, Jake.

32:14.080 --> 32:16.036
You know, then.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.913
I know if Abe were alive,

32:19.040 --> 32:20.678
he would have told me
you were coming.

32:24.240 --> 32:26.071
Shall we take
our tea outside?

32:27.280 --> 32:28.280
Thank you.

32:30.680 --> 32:33.478
Before he died,
he told me to find you.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.318
There was something
he wanted me to know.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.038
He said you could
explain everything.

32:37.200 --> 32:38.553
That's absolutely true.

32:38.720 --> 32:41.029
There are very few things
I can't explain.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.879
We're what's known,
in common parlance,

32:44.960 --> 32:46.712
as "peculiar."

32:47.000 --> 32:48.558
(TICKING)

32:48.640 --> 32:50.312
51 seconds late, Fiona.

32:50.960 --> 32:52.029
Sorry, Miss Peregrine.

32:52.120 --> 32:53.680
How many carrots
do you need for supper?

32:54.120 --> 32:56.190
Just one will do.

33:02.400 --> 33:04.470
(RUMBLING)

33:10.520 --> 33:13.751
As I was saying,
some people are peculiar.

33:13.920 --> 33:16.912
It's a recessive gene
carried down through families.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.071
Yet, many generations
can pass

33:19.160 --> 33:21.549
without a peculiar child
being born.

33:22.760 --> 33:26.912
And alas, peculiars have been
persecuted through the ages.

33:27.080 --> 33:29.196
Hence, we live
in places like this.

33:30.200 --> 33:31.200
In Wales?

33:31.400 --> 33:33.356
Anywhere will do
if you pick the right day.

33:33.520 --> 33:35.078
That's fine now, Fiona.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.754
You see, I'm a type of
peculiar called an Ymbryne.

33:42.920 --> 33:44.273
That means I can...

33:44.440 --> 33:45.668
Yeah, you turn into a bird.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.558
I do. Yes.

33:47.720 --> 33:49.438
But that's not very useful.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.558
An Ymbryne's main skill
is the manipulation of time.

33:52.720 --> 33:54.790
We choose a safe place,
a safe day...

33:54.960 --> 33:57.076
and create a loop.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.279
What do you mean?

33:59.440 --> 34:02.796
A loop preserves
the last 24 hours.

34:02.960 --> 34:05.633
Reset the loop, and the day
is yours to live in again.

34:06.440 --> 34:07.555
Reset it daily...

34:07.720 --> 34:09.630
and you can
stay there forever.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.870
Entirely safe
from the outside world.

34:12.960 --> 34:14.552
Right on time, Bronwyn.
Good girl.

34:18.440 --> 34:19.475
(GRUNTING)

34:20.400 --> 34:21.958
And that's why we Ymbrynes

34:22.080 --> 34:23.638
are charged with the care
of the young.

34:27.080 --> 34:29.310
And no one ever gets older.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.071
It's best for everyone
this way.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.478
I assure you.

34:37.320 --> 34:38.958
Every Ymbryne
commits herself...

34:39.120 --> 34:41.270
to the creation and upkeep
of a place like this.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.953
A home for peculiar children.

34:45.159 --> 34:46.752

34:49.440 --> 34:50.759
HUGH: Get it!

34:57.800 --> 34:59.279
You met the twins.

35:05.320 --> 35:06.514
This is Claire.

We're playing together.

35:18.360 --> 35:20.032
Millard you met.

35:20.680 --> 35:21.680
MILLARD: Ugh. Come on!

35:22.520 --> 35:23.839

Stop cheating, Hugh.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.870
HUGH: Millard,
that's a foul again.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.316
MILLARD: No, it wasn't. Ref?

35:36.720 --> 35:38.711
If you two can't play soccer
without squabbling...

35:38.880 --> 35:40.393
I do wish
you wouldn't play at all.

35:40.560 --> 35:41.720
Do you know
what a referee is?

35:43.040 --> 35:44.632
Good afternoon.
I'm Horace.

35:44.800 --> 35:45.800
Delighted to meet you.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.075
MILLARD: Ow!

35:47.240 --> 35:48.240
Careful!

35:48.360 --> 35:49.873
We sorely need
some new blood here.

35:51.240 --> 35:52.309
Super shirt, by the way.

35:53.640 --> 35:54.640
Thanks.

35:54.840 --> 35:56.512
HUGH: Try harder.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.913
You know Emma, of course.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.752
And I think that's everyone.

36:04.360 --> 36:06.669
Didn't Bronwyn
have a brother?

36:07.560 --> 36:09.596
Yes. Victor's upstairs.

36:09.760 --> 36:11.120
Wait, where did Enoch
and Olive go?

36:11.880 --> 36:13.029
Heaven knows.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.560
Enoch's been off sulking ever
since we went out to get Jake.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.176
Miss Peregrine, there's
a policeman at the door.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.599
He says it's about the pub!

36:21.080 --> 36:22.752
We'll discuss this
later, Emma.

36:24.080 --> 36:25.195
(SIGHS)

36:25.280 --> 36:26.872
It wasn't their fault.

36:27.920 --> 36:30.275
Honestly, they were
just trying to help.

36:34.600 --> 36:35.715
Hmm.

36:40.240 --> 36:41.434
Thanks.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.431
You're not as wet
as I thought.

36:46.440 --> 36:50.035
She's not really gonna
kill anyone, is she?

36:50.200 --> 36:52.270
Not if she can
talk her way out of it.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.118
Would you help me
with something?

36:54.280 --> 36:55.952
Enoch usually does it,
but like I said,

36:56.080 --> 36:57.399
he's off sulking somewhere.

36:58.640 --> 37:00.198
Is that because of me?

37:00.400 --> 37:02.960
He's possessive.

37:05.280 --> 37:07.236
So, what did you
need help with?

37:08.040 --> 37:09.439
One of my daily chores.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.989
Put the baby squirrel
back in the tree.

37:12.160 --> 37:13.309
What baby squirrel?

37:19.440 --> 37:20.839
That happens every day?

37:21.000 --> 37:22.274
Like clockwork.

37:23.160 --> 37:25.200
Now, would you mind tying
that rope around my waist?

37:26.920 --> 37:27.955
Uh, yeah.

37:56.320 --> 37:58.436
Right. Promise to
hold on tight.

38:14.160 --> 38:16.469
(GRUNTS)

38:43.240 --> 38:45.071
I nearly messed that up.

38:46.520 --> 38:49.034
Abe did, too, the first time.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.918
This used to be his job.

38:53.200 --> 38:56.590
Emma, I need to
tell you something.

38:57.760 --> 38:58.909
He's dead.

39:00.560 --> 39:01.709
I know.

39:01.880 --> 39:04.440
Miss Peregrine guessed,
and she's always right.

39:05.920 --> 39:06.920
It's okay.

39:07.760 --> 39:09.910
I said goodbye to him
a long time ago.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.193
Were you close?

39:14.600 --> 39:16.238
I thought we were.

39:17.240 --> 39:18.958
For a while.

39:19.120 --> 39:20.758
But I suppose not.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.918
Can I ask, was he like you?

39:27.600 --> 39:28.749
(CHUCKLES)

39:29.080 --> 39:30.718
He was like you, Jake.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.838
I need to go
and change for supper.

39:35.440 --> 39:36.634
Will you be dining with us?

39:37.080 --> 39:38.957
I can't stay out late.

39:39.120 --> 39:40.758
Supper's at 5:30.

39:41.960 --> 39:44.110
Uh... That
is pretty early.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.392
The fact we're not
all eight years old

39:46.480 --> 39:48.118
seems to have eluded
Miss Peregrine.

39:49.240 --> 39:51.117
You can borrow
some of Abe's clothes.

39:51.320 --> 39:53.311
His room's in the attic.

40:03.640 --> 40:04.640
OLIVE: Jake!

40:05.160 --> 40:06.559
Come and meet Enoch properly.

40:17.640 --> 40:19.835
You must feel
pretty out of place.

40:21.680 --> 40:22.954
Don't worry.

40:23.520 --> 40:25.272
I'm used to it.

40:25.480 --> 40:26.629
No. I wasn't worried.

40:26.800 --> 40:29.519
Some advice for you though,
man to man.

40:29.680 --> 40:32.000
If you're thinking of staying
just because you like Emma...

40:32.360 --> 40:33.360
don't bother.

40:33.520 --> 40:35.829
You see, she swore off
romance decades ago...

40:36.000 --> 40:37.319
when she got
her heart broken.

40:38.200 --> 40:41.033
And she's never gonna
change her mind. So...

40:44.320 --> 40:45.958
Enoch, I wasn't...

40:47.880 --> 40:48.880
What are you doing?

41:19.680 --> 41:20.795
Isn't he amazing?

41:21.320 --> 41:22.389
What did you do?

41:23.080 --> 41:24.479
This?

41:24.880 --> 41:27.155
Jake, this isn't
even the fun part.

42:25.800 --> 42:28.234

Jake, there's some questions

42:30.720 --> 42:32.711
that I can't answer,
all right?

42:32.880 --> 42:34.916

for me if you just...

45:01.560 --> 45:03.073
have a good time instead.

are prophetic.

they're about clothes.

I only meant the path
is dreadfully bumpy.

It's not like
you want me here.

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.828
Enoch, you can't.
You promised.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.194
Olive's right.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.336
I do know someone
who can get away

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.713
with breaking rules though.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.634
Want to meet him?

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:18.640
Enoch, don't
do this. Please!

01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:20.176
You want to spend time
with me and Jake,

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.349
we can all play together.

01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:22.839
That's what you said.

01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:25.918
Here we all are.

01:00:27.200 --> 01:00:28.872
Move, Olive.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.280
If you're going
to be like that,

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.669
then I don't want
to be your friend.

01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:39.399
Enoch, leave Victor alone.
It really upsets Bronwyn.

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:41.357
Stop fussing, Fiona.

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:43.120
Don't you think Jake
should meet everybody?

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:44.760
He's trying to frighten
you away, Jake.

01:00:44.880 --> 01:00:47.678
He was always jealous of Abe.
And now he's jealous of you.

01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.239
Come and play
with us instead.

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:56.273
I'd quite like
to meet Victor.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:04.074
After you.

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:13.635
Hello, Victor.

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.877
I'm Jake.
I'm sorry to disturb...

01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.788
ENOCH:
Yeah, he can't hear you.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.157
Hello, Jake. I'm Victor.

01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:51.679
Do you want to know
what killed me?

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.471
There you are.
Is Enoch with you?

01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.079
It's time for
our daily walk.

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:08.469
Emma, who killed Victor?

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.312
Was it the people
with the white eyes?

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.118
I asked you
not to ask questions.

01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.272
I saw one the night
my grandpa died.

01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.475
A man.

01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.475
If it really was one,

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:21.192
you have to
tell Miss Peregrine.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:23.476
Could you recognize him
from a photograph?

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:25.039
Do you have one?

01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.316
Come on. There's somewhere
I go to be alone.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.873
I have things there.

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:05.749
(TICKING)

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.514
Is this the place?

01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:10.870
No. This is how we get there.

01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.231
Oh! Emma! Your shoes!

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.833
Lead shoes!

01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.434
(GASPS)

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:28.560
(GASPING)

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.831
(EMMA PANTING)

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:37.353
Welcome to my
secret hideout.

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.472
How did you...

01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.629
Air.

01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:44.998
It's my peculiarity.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.517
It does what I want.

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:07.754
Jake...

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.558
before your
grandfather retired...

01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:11.870
he asked me
to keep this safe.

01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.359
This is my grandpa's
old map.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:33.078
It shows you
where the loops are.

01:06:44.360 --> 01:06:45.918
That's him!

01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.752
That's the man I saw.

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.918
Who is he?
That's Barron.

01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.080
He's the leader.

01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:53.753
The leader of what?

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:55.794
Who are these people?

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.913
Bad people. Bad peculiars.

01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:03.598
Abe dedicated his life
to hunting them down.

01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.591
These are the ones
he never found.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.271
What do you mean, hunting?

01:07:11.280 --> 01:07:13.077
They raided loops.

01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:16.630
Whole homes full of children
left for dead.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.315
Abe took lives
to save lives.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.313
He only retired when you were
born to protect you.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.469
From what?

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.669
If I tell you the rest,

01:07:29.800 --> 01:07:31.836
you have to promise
not to run away.

01:07:33.080 --> 01:07:36.117
Jake, you belong here.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.673
You know I don't.

01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.796
I'm not like you.

01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:41.754
I'm just ordinary.

01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:43.273
No, you're not.

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:44.475
Jake...

01:07:44.640 --> 01:07:47.518
only a peculiar
can enter a time loop.

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.151
No. That can't be right.

01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:54.199
I would know.

01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:56.160
Fine.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.832
Then I'll show you
something else.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.469
Hurry. You'll miss it.

01:08:22.319 --> 01:08:25.676
Ymbrynes usually pick the
perfect day to create a loop.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:27.800
But Miss Peregrine had to
make this one in a rush.

01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.080
Why?

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:32.895
Because the Germans were about
to drop a bomb on the house.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:34.353
The point is...

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:37.353
September the 3rd, 1943
wasn't perfect.

01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.910
The thing that killed
Victor came back.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:02.879
(GROWLING)

01:09:08.080 --> 01:09:09.115
(SHOUTS) Wait! Watch out!

01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.108
You'll put her off!

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:30.915
(SCREECHES)

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.392
You can see it, can't you?

01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:43.433
No one else can.

01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:46.069
It's invisible, Jake.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:47.680
That was Abe's
greatest gift of all.

01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:52.438
He could see the monsters.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.751
We call them Hollowgast.

01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:01.109
Hollows for short.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:05.919
My grandpa told me about
people who turn into monsters.

01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:07.433
Is that what they are?

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.436
I will explain
everything, Jake.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.756
I fear it's my duty now,
considering.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:13.976
But you should know
that in doing so,

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.160
I'm breaking
a solemn promise.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.956
I knew you were peculiar
when you were born.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.835
But your grandfather forbid
me to tell you anything.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:26.310
His dearest wish was for you
to have an ordinary childhood.

01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:28.637
I definitely had that.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:31.314
He intended to tell you the
truth when you turned 18.

01:10:31.840 --> 01:10:36.311
He hoped his bedtime stories
would pave the way.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.035
Ah.

01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:39.513
Here's my book.

01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:52.359
Many years ago...

01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.793
a splinter faction emerged
among our people.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:58.520
Disaffected peculiars
tired of living in loops.

01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:01.634
That's Mr. Barron.

01:11:01.800 --> 01:11:03.836
He believed that
by harnessing the essence

01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:05.552
of an Ymbryne's powers...

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:08.473
he and his cronies
could gain immortality...

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.995
and be able
to live outside loops.

01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.316
He devised an experiment.

01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:18.311
He kidnapped an Ymbryne...

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.400
not knowing or caring

01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:21.351
whether she would survive
the experiment.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:23.518
(CRANKING)

01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.796
But the fate of Barron
and his group

01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.279
was more horrifying still.

01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:55.349
(CHOKING)

01:11:55.440 --> 01:11:57.237
(GROANING)

01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.078

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:25.909
Why didn't Barron
turn into one?

(HOWLING)

01:12:39.400 --> 01:12:40.799
He did.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:42.592
But years later...

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.955
he found a way
to reverse the effects.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.599
To regain humanity.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:50.116
They had become not
immortal gods, but Hollows.

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.589
Invisible beasts, dangerous...

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.791
cold-blooded, deadly.

01:12:54.960 --> 01:12:56.680
EMMA: Remember I told you
they raided loops?

01:12:57.640 --> 01:12:58.834
This is why.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:01.440
MISS PEREGRINE: Barron
discovered that by consuming

01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:03.670
the eyes of other peculiars...

01:13:03.840 --> 01:13:05.956
especially children...

01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:08.112
(GROWLING)
(SHRIEKS)

01:13:13.440 --> 01:13:14.998
he began to change.

01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:27.313
(GOBBLING)

01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.033
(CHOMPING)

01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:34.599
Consume enough, and a Hollow

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.472
can fully regain
its human form.

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:37.999
Bon appetit.

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:41.035
MISS PEREGRINE: Just as Barron
and some of his friends did.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:43.995
(SIGHS) Mmm.

01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.157
The rest of them
are stuck as Hollows.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:58.190
Are you saying
that Barron ate my grand...

01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:00.056
MISS PEREGRINE: He needs
no more eyes himself.

01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:03.834
But I fear he led a Hollow
to your grandfather. Yes.

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.995
After the first attacks
on loops...

01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.515
we all got better at hiding,
making new loops,

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:12.198
keeping our
whereabouts secret.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.869
The Hollows grow more
desperate every year...

01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:18.679
and Barron wishes
to help his friends.

01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:21.070
Miss Peregrine, come quickly.
Miss Avocet's awake.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:23.360
(MISS AVOCET SPEAKING
INDISTINCTLY)

01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.438
And suddenly,
I flew into it again...

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:28.830
Bang! Bang!
I couldn't see anything.

01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.868
Oh, Miss Peregrine.
They found my new loop.

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.918
The children.
I tried to save them...

01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:36.672
but there were
so many Hollows.

01:14:36.840 --> 01:14:38.558
I don't know how I escaped.

01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:42.229
You're safe now.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.231
None of us are safe.

01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.356
They set up the machine
in my loop.

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.511
They put it in the cellars
at Blackpool Tower.

01:14:48.680 --> 01:14:49.908
They're still there.

01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:51.911
Their machine?
The experiment.

01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.514
They intend to do it again.

01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:56.750
This time, he's using
more Ymbrynes.

01:14:56.920 --> 01:14:58.797
He still wants
to be immortal.

01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.791
Do Hollows
only attack peculiars?

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.188
Of course not.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.314
They're monsters, Jake.

01:15:08.440 --> 01:15:10.590
They'll slaughter anything
in their path.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:13.035
Some sheep on the island
were killed.

01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:15.795
You don't think they're here
already, do you?

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:18.231
Have you seen anyone
with white eyes?

01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.756
I'm sorry, children.
We can't remain here.

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:25.920
What?

01:15:26.120 --> 01:15:28.280
We'll leave on the first ferry
off the island tomorrow.

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:30.112
Pack anything
of importance.

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.958
Then it's sandwiches
and early to bed.

01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.439
Are we leaving for good?

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:35.272
When are we coming back?
Never.

If Miss Peregrine's
not here

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.999
to reset the loop
tomorrow night...

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:39.160
the house gets bombed.

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:40.469
But our house.

01:15:40.680 --> 01:15:41.715
Don't cry.

01:15:41.800 --> 01:15:42.920
Miss Peregrine will find you

01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:44.400
another lovely house,
somewhere else.

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:53.437
Once this loop closes,
that's it.

01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:55.397
I can't get back
to my own time.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:57.438
You didn't seem
very happy there.

01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.956
I can't just leave!
I have a family!

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:02.513
And you felt ordinary.

01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.114
Like, nothing you do
changes anything!

01:16:05.280 --> 01:16:06.872
Now you have a chance
to do something

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:08.393
that changes everything!

01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:11.311
Jake, we're in danger.

01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.948
And you're the only one
who can see the Hollows.

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:17.157
Yeah, see them, sure.
But I'm not my grandpa!

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.355
I'm not, and I can't fight.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.112
I can't kill somebody.

01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:28.559
There's only one reason
that I'd stay here...

01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:29.720
Please.

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:32.273
Just go.

01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.360
Jake? Jakey,
there you are.

01:17:03.520 --> 01:17:04.555
Thank God!

01:17:04.760 --> 01:17:06.955
When I heard they found
a body, I freaked.

01:17:31.600 --> 01:17:33.272
Are there stray dogs
around here?

01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.120
What you talking about?

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.198
It's like...

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.839
when they find
an injured animal,

01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.990
they go for
the soft parts first.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.072

to my father.

on their way.

01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.434
Look, Dad. I've gotta go.

01:17:50.640 --> 01:17:52.676
What? No.
You don't, Jake.

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:54.480
If this wasn't an accident,

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.800
there's a lunatic
on the island.

01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.840
I've known everyone on
this island my whole life.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:00.877
Except you, and him.

01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:02.856
And he's been in the pub
all afternoon.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.791

I was sleeping.

about the blind fellow?

01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:09.149
I assumed he was blind.

the dark glasses...

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:13.036

the same ferry as me?

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:15.077
I kept seeing him around.

grateful to you.

01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.228
Terribly hard to find loops
these days.

01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:17.998
So, you followed me from
the beach on purpose?

Oh, no.

of my peculiarity...

I saw you
at your grandfather's.

Miss Peregrine's
address from him.

got to him before I did.

Would you make your way
down the stairs, please?

01:21:37.520 --> 01:21:40.273
I give the orders

You should know that Jake
has served his purpose.

everyone does

we're going to do
what Mr. Barron asks.

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:17.308
He wishes
to take me with him

01:22:17.400 --> 01:22:18.879

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:22.233

to assume bird form,

01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:23.753
preferably caged.

01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.990
He'd like you to make your
way into a lockable room,

such as the parlor...

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.318
as he won't release Jake
if he fears

01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:30.880
an attack could be mounted
upon him...

01:22:30.960 --> 01:22:32.632

being on my own

02:04:13.320 --> 02:04:17.393
Then something broke in me
and I wanted to go home

02:04:18.360 --> 02:04:20.510
To be where you are

02:04:21.520 --> 02:04:27.356
But even closer to you
You seem so very far

02:04:28.320 --> 02:04:32.598
And now I'm reaching out
with every note I sing

02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:37.478
And I hope it gets to you
on some Pacific wind

02:04:37.560 --> 02:04:42.236
Wraps itself around you
and whispers in your ear

02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:48.072
Tells you that I miss you and
I wish that you were here

02:04:49.305 --> 02:04:55.479
