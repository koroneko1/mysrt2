00:00:19.893 --> 00:00:21.520
So the Suppalo curse is back?

00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:23.440
I’ve got something to talk to you about.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.910
Do you really not see

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.758
that you’re encouraging this bad system to continue?

00:00:27.921 --> 00:00:29.269
I’m wondering

00:00:30.001 --> 00:00:32.440
if Teacher Chadok was the reason he died.

00:00:58.682 --> 00:01:00.263
I thought you wouldn’t come.

00:01:04.264 --> 00:01:05.752
What do you think you’re doing?

00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:19.643
What are you doing?

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:03.790
What did Teacher Chadok do exactly?

00:02:05.412 --> 00:02:08.134
Probably the same thing he does to you and Teacher Sani.

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:10.104
What thing?

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.412
Forcing you and Teacher Sani to believe in Suppalo’s rules.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:19.860
Especially you.

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:22.382
He’s even brainwashed you to do it.

00:02:22.747 --> 00:02:24.095
But all those things,

00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:26.661
they were all my doing.

00:02:26.987 --> 00:02:28.020
He didn’t order me to.

00:02:29.432 --> 00:02:30.454
Are you sure?

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.159
He might not say it directly.

00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:40.431
But he gives you signs.

00:02:47.105 --> 00:02:48.383
What have I done?

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.108
It’s okay.

00:02:52.741 --> 00:02:54.345
What have I done?

00:02:56.805 --> 00:02:57.827
It’s okay.

00:03:02.858 --> 00:03:04.625
If I just disappear from this world…

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.664
Akk.

00:03:22.226 --> 00:03:23.714
Don’t you think like that.

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:28.080
Don’t disappear.

00:03:32.926 --> 00:03:34.157
Please do not disappear.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:40.366
Akk.

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:43.581
Without me, all these things wouldn’t have happened.

00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:45.201
Akk.

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.309
Akk.

00:04:01.504 --> 00:04:02.665
You can change.

00:04:17.798 --> 00:04:20.920
Thank you for keeping me company as a boyfriend.

00:04:22.084 --> 00:04:23.176
What?

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.000
People just say, “Thank you for keeping me company.”

00:04:25.113 --> 00:04:25.868
Well.

00:04:26.078 --> 00:04:27.800
We are boyfriends.

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:29.362
I won’t go back to be your friend.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.966
No way.

00:04:32.397 --> 00:04:33.880
You just keep rambling again.

00:04:34.738 --> 00:04:35.453
I’m going to sleep.

00:04:37.503 --> 00:04:38.217
Akk.

00:04:38.427 --> 00:04:39.091
Hm?

00:04:39.091 --> 00:04:40.001
Don’t move over.

00:04:41.856 --> 00:04:43.120
Get closer to me.

00:04:43.465 --> 00:04:45.000
The bed is huge.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.275
Back on your side.

00:04:46.275 --> 00:04:47.174
No.

00:04:47.624 --> 00:04:49.880
If you want to sleep like this, I’ll sleep like this too.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:50.676
Aye.

00:04:50.676 --> 00:04:52.390
It’s hot. Get off me.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.943
No.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.046
Aye.

00:05:00.615 --> 00:05:02.162
Why are you so stubborn, Shortstop?

00:05:05.001 --> 00:05:08.026
To get your attention like this, Big Foot.

00:05:20.335 --> 00:05:21.264
Kiss me.

00:05:22.568 --> 00:05:23.328
No.

00:05:23.649 --> 00:05:24.575
Come on.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.590
- Oh, come on.
- Nope.

00:05:28.573 --> 00:05:29.527
Do you want to sleep?

00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:33.694
Are you happy now?

00:05:43.191 --> 00:05:43.897
That’s enough.

00:05:45.278 --> 00:05:46.339
Aye!

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:46.998
The last spot.

00:06:00.141 --> 00:06:01.745
What are you going to do about tomorrow?

00:06:02.017 --> 00:06:03.691
It’s the school foundation day.

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.077
I have no clue.

00:06:15.987 --> 00:06:17.170
Can we just skip tomorrow?

00:06:27.492 --> 00:06:28.886
Can I borrow your suit?

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:34.166
And your armband?

00:06:34.818 --> 00:06:36.446
I’ll get one from my locker.

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:44.343
Are you scared?

00:06:49.514 --> 00:06:52.999
But you’re getting the Best Boy award today.

00:06:57.974 --> 00:06:59.974
I used to want that award so much.

00:07:01.708 --> 00:07:02.963
But now…

00:07:03.904 --> 00:07:06.114
I think that piece of paper is worthless.

00:07:28.632 --> 00:07:29.840
What are you doing?

00:07:30.135 --> 00:07:31.178
I can do it myself.

00:07:32.135 --> 00:07:33.278
I want to do it for you.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:36.346
Now

00:07:38.535 --> 00:07:40.208
Your pin has its own story created by me.

00:07:42.537 --> 00:07:43.373
What?

00:07:43.792 --> 00:07:45.212
It’s just a school pin.

00:07:45.647 --> 00:07:46.362
No.

00:07:48.156 --> 00:07:50.093
It isn’t just a school pin.

00:07:52.136 --> 00:07:58.748
It’s my school pin I pinned for you,

00:08:01.077 --> 00:08:02.064
the person I love.

00:08:05.877 --> 00:08:07.365
And, going forward,

00:08:08.824 --> 00:08:10.824
regardless of who does anything to you,

00:08:13.196 --> 00:08:15.149
you'll always be the same Akk for me.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.215
Forever.

00:08:29.236 --> 00:08:30.258
Hello, sir.

00:08:30.258 --> 00:08:31.235
Hello.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:09:00.378
The sponsorship from the alumni association will be discussed in the next meeting, won’t it, sir?

00:09:01.287 --> 00:09:01.998
Yes.

00:09:03.582 --> 00:09:06.734
But it also depends on the event held today, principal.

00:09:19.915 --> 00:09:29.392
Today's ceremony has been Suppalo's tradition for more than a century.

00:09:30.719 --> 00:09:37.541
Everyone, please recite the pledge with pride.

00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:39.533
I pledge to adhere to Suppalo rules above all else.

00:10:40.494 --> 00:10:42.214
As I realize that

00:10:46.588 --> 00:10:49.799
with rules comes honor.

00:10:50.312 --> 00:10:54.292
with rules comes honor.

00:10:54.615 --> 00:10:58.152
with rules comes honor.

00:10:58.516 --> 00:11:02.216
with rules comes honor.

00:11:29.245 --> 00:11:30.733
Thank you.

00:11:33.217 --> 00:11:35.357
I will look into that for you.

00:11:35.678 --> 00:11:39.080
We’re so thankful for your continued sponsorship, sir.

00:11:39.614 --> 00:11:40.729
Thank you, principal.

00:11:40.729 --> 00:11:57.832
Stop the Suppalo curse.
Find the one responsible.

00:11:57.832 --> 00:11:59.426
Deal with them.

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.234
Yes, ma’am.

00:12:01.234 --> 00:12:12.003
Stop the Suppalo curse.
Find the one responsible.

00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:15.140
Aren’t you scared of the Suppalo curse?

00:12:15.416 --> 00:12:18.360
We just want the school to take responsibility for what happened.

00:12:18.977 --> 00:12:20.977
You better tell the truth.

00:12:20.977 --> 00:12:21.598
Thua.

00:12:22.288 --> 00:12:23.403
Stop talking.

00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:25.000
It’s time we see the last boss.

00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:43.504
Stop the Suppalo curse.
Find the one responsible.

00:12:43.504 --> 00:12:46.120
Protesting inside the school is strictly prohibited.

00:12:46.282 --> 00:12:47.318
You are in breach of the rule.

00:12:47.997 --> 00:12:49.096
What are you doing?

00:12:49.096 --> 00:12:51.103
Don’t you care at all about the school's reputation?

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:55.509
Teacher, should we talk to them in the Student Welfare Department room?

00:12:57.501 --> 00:12:58.463
Student prefects,

00:12:58.710 --> 00:12:59.748
take them.

00:12:59.876 --> 00:13:00.783
Security guard!

00:13:03.336 --> 00:13:04.317
Let me go.

00:13:04.317 --> 00:13:05.659
We have the right to protest.

00:13:06.168 --> 00:13:07.656
We have the right to find the truth.

00:13:07.656 --> 00:13:08.764
Let me go.

00:13:08.764 --> 00:13:09.927
Let go!

00:13:09.927 --> 00:13:10.849
You can’t do this to us.

00:13:10.849 --> 00:13:12.117
Let us go!

00:13:12.117 --> 00:13:13.395
You can’t do this to us.

00:13:13.395 --> 00:13:16.094
Let us go!

00:13:16.094 --> 00:13:16.967
Release the students!

00:13:18.357 --> 00:13:19.819
Let the students go.

00:13:22.183 --> 00:13:24.183
Stop treating us like we’re prisoners.

00:13:25.601 --> 00:13:26.789
Release the students!

00:13:27.148 --> 00:13:27.960
Thua.

00:13:28.496 --> 00:13:34.934
Release the students!

00:13:35.232 --> 00:13:37.232
Aren’t you scared of the curse?

00:13:37.738 --> 00:13:38.729
You, a bunch of misfits.

00:13:38.857 --> 00:13:48.589
- Misfits!
- Release the students!

00:13:48.589 --> 00:13:50.002
Aren’t you going to do anything, Akk?

00:13:50.002 --> 00:13:54.661
- Misfits!
- Release the students!

00:13:54.661 --> 00:13:55.465
Enough!

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.257
Aren’t you scared of the Suppalo curse?

00:14:01.657 --> 00:14:02.424
No.

00:14:02.936 --> 00:14:05.936
We just want the school to take responsibility for what happened.

00:14:07.408 --> 00:14:08.355
Not just the school.

00:14:11.778 --> 00:14:14.204
The student prefect club must take responsibility as well.

00:14:15.599 --> 00:14:17.599
Because you guys took part in this conspiracy with the school.

00:14:18.809 --> 00:14:21.593
You made up stories and used them to scare us.

00:14:25.586 --> 00:14:27.183
You’re head of the class.

00:14:27.578 --> 00:14:29.825
You’ve been a well-behaving student.

00:14:30.034 --> 00:14:32.460
Why are you siding with these unruly students?

00:14:35.178 --> 00:14:36.999
I’m just doing my duty, Teacher.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.491
What are you saying, Thua?

00:14:41.237 --> 00:14:42.789
You can't just accuse us.

00:14:43.101 --> 00:14:44.180
We had nothing to do with that.

00:14:45.189 --> 00:14:46.048
Thua,

00:14:47.026 --> 00:14:48.667
one topic at a time, will you?

00:14:50.579 --> 00:14:52.416
Can we just help The World Remembers first?

00:14:52.416 --> 00:14:53.799
Don’t stop me, Aye.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.496
Are you afraid to hear what I’m saying?

00:14:56.788 --> 00:14:58.026
Are you?

00:14:59.487 --> 00:15:01.136
It’s not that, Thua.

00:15:01.762 --> 00:15:03.672
I just don’t want you to accuse people

00:15:03.989 --> 00:15:05.451
without evidence.

00:15:05.451 --> 00:15:06.830
You’re my evidence, Aye.

00:15:08.501 --> 00:15:11.353
The most credible witness here is you.

00:15:12.293 --> 00:15:14.976
You know who brought back the curse…

00:15:15.606 --> 00:15:16.308
No.

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:18.772
Who invented it.

00:15:19.063 --> 00:15:19.902
It’s Akk.

00:15:22.098 --> 00:15:23.461
Thua, stop!

00:15:23.461 --> 00:15:25.042
Stop protecting him, Aye.

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.259
He’s done many terrible things to you.

00:15:28.086 --> 00:15:29.245
Oh, right. Actually,

00:15:30.612 --> 00:15:33.067
you two are secretly dating.

00:15:37.526 --> 00:15:39.728
I respect your love.

00:15:40.633 --> 00:15:42.319
But I won’t put up with this.

00:15:43.105 --> 00:15:48.557
You can’t just use your love as an excuse to cover your wrong.

00:15:48.557 --> 00:15:49.404
That’s not right.

00:15:54.775 --> 00:15:55.351
Akk.

00:15:55.822 --> 00:15:58.583
You better confess you did it.

00:16:01.236 --> 00:16:03.236
You didn’t do it alone, did you?

00:16:06.133 --> 00:16:08.312
Someone was backing you up, right?

00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:18.781
My stepdad told me the curse began when Teacher Chadok was a student here.

00:16:19.769 --> 00:16:21.321
And he became the student prefect president.

00:16:22.044 --> 00:16:24.313
There was a solar eclipse happening that year, just as now.

00:16:25.381 --> 00:16:28.524
Many scary tales about the curse had been told among students.

00:16:28.985 --> 00:16:32.330
Students were terrified and paranoid.

00:16:32.635 --> 00:16:35.285
They used the curse to eliminate those who had opposing viewpoints.

00:16:35.651 --> 00:16:38.010
The student prefect club was the army.

00:16:38.594 --> 00:16:42.275
And the head of the student welfare department was the one behind them.

00:16:44.075 --> 00:16:46.792
Thuaphu, you’re a student.

00:16:47.301 --> 00:16:49.839
You can’t just accuse your teacher like that.

00:16:52.618 --> 00:16:53.378
I did it.

00:16:55.616 --> 00:16:57.147
I did everything by myself.

00:16:58.591 --> 00:16:59.936
No one else was involved.

00:17:00.694 --> 00:17:01.353
Akk,

00:17:02.451 --> 00:17:04.487
you don’t have to say anything now.

00:17:04.945 --> 00:17:06.010
He has to.

00:17:06.671 --> 00:17:08.696
Aye, stop protecting him.

00:17:09.554 --> 00:17:11.976
So are you two really dating?

00:17:17.768 --> 00:17:18.798
An act.

00:17:20.322 --> 00:17:21.651
This is all an act.

00:17:22.701 --> 00:17:23.603
Act?

00:17:24.016 --> 00:17:25.361
What act?

00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:27.656
A short film.

00:17:28.445 --> 00:17:32.597
I’m making a short film for a contest.

00:17:32.901 --> 00:17:37.478
It’s about two students in an all-boy school secretly dating.

00:17:38.059 --> 00:17:38.807
That’s right.

00:17:39.524 --> 00:17:42.636
I can confirm that. I’m working behind this short film.

00:17:42.636 --> 00:17:43.482
Right, Aye?

00:17:46.747 --> 00:17:47.582
Yes.

00:17:49.137 --> 00:17:50.756
Put that aside for now, Wasuwat.

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:52.519
Teacher.

00:17:52.753 --> 00:17:54.753
Let’s handle the protest first.

00:17:55.296 --> 00:17:56.074
Yes.

00:17:56.121 --> 00:17:59.936
We will investigate what happened today and the day you guys protested outside the school too.

00:18:00.088 --> 00:18:01.707
The principal is waiting to hear the result.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:02.985
Of course.

00:18:04.199 --> 00:18:05.930
Follow me to the Student Welfare Department.

00:18:18.703 --> 00:18:20.322
You are free to speak your mind.

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.532
I will protect you.

00:18:23.787 --> 00:18:24.779
Yes, ma’am.

00:20:14.466 --> 00:20:15.196
Thank you.

00:20:17.998 --> 00:20:18.887
Are you okay?

00:20:26.697 --> 00:20:28.316
I ruined everything.

00:20:46.535 --> 00:20:50.328
Think of it as

00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:54.071
you ruined the old bad things.

00:20:55.377 --> 00:20:57.646
And start fresh with something better.

00:20:59.653 --> 00:21:00.241
Sounds good?

00:21:01.641 --> 00:21:02.431
You think so?

00:21:06.619 --> 00:21:09.202
But the principal has now ordered a committee to investigate it.

00:21:11.164 --> 00:21:12.178
Don’t overthink it.

00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:29.046
Are you sad to quit the student prefect club?

00:21:45.016 --> 00:21:49.974
With or without the armband, you’re still Akk.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.388
You know that, right?

00:22:05.384 --> 00:22:07.698
[Wat: Come to the student welfare department now!]

00:22:20.886 --> 00:22:21.578
Thua.

00:22:22.721 --> 00:22:23.715
Why are you doing this?

00:22:27.102 --> 00:22:28.896
I just want everyone to tell the truth.

00:22:35.435 --> 00:22:36.242
Kan.

00:22:38.371 --> 00:22:39.161
Wat.

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.456
Thank you for what you did there.

00:22:43.742 --> 00:22:45.159
You lied to me.

00:22:45.962 --> 00:22:47.296
You lied about the curse.

00:22:47.296 --> 00:22:48.860
Kan, stop.

00:22:55.345 --> 00:22:57.345
You guys must be so disappointed in me, right?

00:22:58.510 --> 00:22:59.308
About what?

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.398
I don’t care who you like.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:10.176
What I do care is what you did.

00:23:12.534 --> 00:23:14.153
Don’t fight now.

00:23:14.617 --> 00:23:15.327
Wat.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:16.595
Kan.

00:23:17.657 --> 00:23:19.657
You learned the truth from Thua.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:23.096
Someone is behind Akk.

00:23:35.958 --> 00:23:36.727
Let’s go.

00:23:38.699 --> 00:23:39.930
It’s time we see the last boss.

00:23:48.325 --> 00:23:50.078
Do you remember this necklace?

00:23:50.817 --> 00:23:52.369
It belonged to my uncle.

00:23:53.096 --> 00:23:54.715
I’m sorry, sir.

00:24:06.706 --> 00:24:08.706
I only asked for those involved.

00:24:09.506 --> 00:24:11.244
You’re not. Leave this room, Ayan.

00:24:14.336 --> 00:24:15.460
Of course, I’m involved.

00:24:17.303 --> 00:24:18.911
Do you remember this necklace?

00:24:20.897 --> 00:24:22.436
It belonged to my uncle.

00:24:24.367 --> 00:24:26.782
I’m Teacher Dika’s nephew.

00:24:32.467 --> 00:24:33.891
Why are you telling that to me?

00:24:35.167 --> 00:24:37.006
Do you have any idea of how he is?

00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:40.564
Do you know?

00:24:43.670 --> 00:24:45.232
Your uncle joined the rival school.

00:24:45.232 --> 00:24:46.819
My uncle killed himself!

00:24:50.087 --> 00:24:52.271
He did it because of your teacher.

00:24:58.002 --> 00:25:00.417
You remember that journal he had, don't you?

00:25:01.965 --> 00:25:03.527
You killed my uncle.

00:25:04.439 --> 00:25:07.364
Just like you are killing Akk and Teacher Sani now.

00:25:11.909 --> 00:25:13.333
Why did you do it?

00:25:13.333 --> 00:25:15.048
Why did you kill my uncle?

00:25:15.048 --> 00:25:15.706
Aye.

00:25:17.626 --> 00:25:20.202
No one would ever kill someone he loves, Ayan.

00:25:39.054 --> 00:25:40.708
I’m sorry, sir.

00:26:22.538 --> 00:26:24.815
When Teacher Dika first joined this school,

00:26:27.644 --> 00:26:29.644
A drama was beginning.

00:26:35.235 --> 00:26:37.512
Student welfare teachers were quitting.

00:26:37.814 --> 00:26:38.562
Hello.

00:26:41.283 --> 00:26:42.204
Hi.

00:26:43.329 --> 00:26:45.490
Thank you for having me.

00:26:47.283 --> 00:26:52.395
So the school board asked every new teacher to help out in the department.

00:26:55.187 --> 00:26:57.371
This is the manual for student welfare teachers.

00:26:57.889 --> 00:26:58.804
Take a look.

00:26:59.473 --> 00:27:00.212
Thank you.

00:27:07.138 --> 00:27:10.222
Dika and I were secretly dating.

00:27:19.905 --> 00:27:24.395
We were planning to get married in secret and move in together.

00:27:24.673 --> 00:27:26.742
I don't want the one in the middle. Let’s take the one on the left.

00:27:26.845 --> 00:27:28.453
It looks great.

00:27:28.765 --> 00:27:29.738
What about the house?

00:27:30.383 --> 00:27:31.410
What house?

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.248
The one we just looked at.

00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:39.396
Chadok.

00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:42.213
Are you messing with me?

00:27:44.976 --> 00:27:49.235
I know things between us are tough.

00:27:49.825 --> 00:27:53.347
But I promise I’ll do my best.

00:28:02.413 --> 00:28:04.229
Let me show the ring.

00:28:05.099 --> 00:28:08.390
One, two, three.

00:28:14.321 --> 00:28:16.564
What the hell are you doing in my school?

00:28:28.845 --> 00:28:32.436
I felt bad about it.

00:28:34.068 --> 00:28:35.607
You’re teachers.

00:28:36.289 --> 00:28:38.289
You must be role models for students.

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:41.959
We just love each other.
How is that a bad model for students?

00:28:42.487 --> 00:28:45.109
You guys can do whatever shit you want anywhere else.

00:28:45.654 --> 00:28:47.654
But not here at Suppalo.

00:28:50.921 --> 00:28:51.884
Miss principal.

00:28:53.146 --> 00:28:54.604
Can you please give us one more chance?

00:28:57.717 --> 00:28:59.210
You will always get a chance.

00:29:00.530 --> 00:29:01.564
Listen to me!

00:29:02.893 --> 00:29:05.539
But you must stand by our school.

00:29:20.994 --> 00:29:28.827
I used all the connections I had to transfer Dika to Parot School.

00:29:29.610 --> 00:29:31.356
He was waiting for you at Parot.

00:29:32.339 --> 00:29:34.178
But you chose to stay at Suppalo.

00:29:42.205 --> 00:29:45.542
After that, Di and I were still together.

00:29:46.954 --> 00:29:51.490
Until he went to treatment for his depressive disorder.

00:29:54.371 --> 00:29:56.210
He started to write those journals.

00:30:00.329 --> 00:30:02.560
I didn’t want anyone to find out.

00:30:05.408 --> 00:30:07.224
So I ripped those pages out.

00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.728
I didn’t think…

00:30:14.885 --> 00:30:16.862
my action would

00:30:20.965 --> 00:30:23.403
urge Dika to do that.

00:30:53.459 --> 00:30:54.375
Teacher Chadok.

00:30:59.165 --> 00:31:04.992
Why do we let these absurd rules and systems hurt us so much?

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:24.755
I’m leaving.

00:31:25.656 --> 00:31:26.709
My mom is here.

00:31:27.493 --> 00:31:28.325
Thua.

00:31:29.747 --> 00:31:31.171
Don’t you think you should clear things up with me?

00:31:34.714 --> 00:31:36.092
In crime movies,

00:31:36.905 --> 00:31:39.066
the bad guy always confesses in the end.

00:31:41.036 --> 00:31:42.875
Aren’t you going to confess anything?

00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:45.614
The Eclipse account.

00:31:52.816 --> 00:31:54.724
Don’t you go around accusing people like that.

00:31:55.161 --> 00:31:56.377
Listen to what he has to say then.

00:31:58.908 --> 00:32:00.239
I really was the one who owned that Eclipse account.

00:32:02.524 --> 00:32:04.870
And you were the one creating that fabric banner to scare The World Remembers gang.

00:32:06.126 --> 00:32:07.988
You threatened the protesters on Twitter.

00:32:08.694 --> 00:32:10.048
You burned their doll.

00:32:10.425 --> 00:32:11.895
Why did you do it, Thua?

00:32:12.535 --> 00:32:14.328
I thought you were neutral.

00:32:14.572 --> 00:32:15.765
I used to be neutral.

00:32:17.681 --> 00:32:22.194
I did all those curse things after you because I didn’t want things to just die out.

00:32:22.309 --> 00:32:23.064
Thua.

00:32:23.392 --> 00:32:24.390
Kan.

00:32:25.289 --> 00:32:26.291
Kan!

00:32:26.705 --> 00:32:27.898
I’m sorry, Kan.

00:32:28.993 --> 00:32:30.163
I had to do it.

00:32:30.856 --> 00:32:32.787
So that everyone would tell the truth.

00:32:34.777 --> 00:32:38.668
What you did is not different than what Akk did.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.206
I know.

00:32:41.875 --> 00:32:45.670
I just couldn’t take it that once Akk and Aye got together,

00:32:45.710 --> 00:32:47.710
they helped each other cover the truth.

00:32:49.879 --> 00:32:53.585
Do you really think you can fix it by letting it go away quietly?

00:32:56.453 --> 00:32:59.098
So you caused me to misunderstand Akk again

00:33:00.434 --> 00:33:03.241
You’re the one who took my uncle’s journal.

00:33:06.705 --> 00:33:07.691
It’s you Thua.

00:33:09.482 --> 00:33:12.612
Once Akk and I made up,

00:33:13.628 --> 00:33:14.660
you changed your target.

00:33:15.576 --> 00:33:16.564
To teacher Chadok.

00:33:20.163 --> 00:33:22.071
I saw it, Thua.

00:33:22.808 --> 00:33:25.892
You were leaving the journal with the pile of assignments.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:31.510
After I read your uncle’s journal,

00:33:32.895 --> 00:33:37.154
I was sure the one behind Akk is Teacher Chadok.

00:33:40.174 --> 00:33:41.990
So I made use of your rage.

00:33:42.133 --> 00:33:43.280
Why?

00:33:43.385 --> 00:33:44.394
Why did you do it?

00:33:44.394 --> 00:33:45.689
Kan, enough!

00:33:45.689 --> 00:33:46.752
This is not you at all.

00:33:46.752 --> 00:33:47.984
This is me!

00:33:50.518 --> 00:33:56.564
I did it because it’s the only way to make everyone tell the truth.

00:33:57.896 --> 00:34:00.080
Everyone just has to admit it.

00:34:00.347 --> 00:34:02.670
So the lies and the tales can be gone.

00:34:03.238 --> 00:34:05.238
Can you just not care about other people?

00:34:05.548 --> 00:34:07.202
Why do you care so freaking much?

00:34:17.851 --> 00:34:19.090
What should I do to you?

00:34:22.566 --> 00:34:24.289
Do as your duty tells you.

00:34:24.653 --> 00:34:25.724
If I tell…

00:34:26.277 --> 00:34:27.413
I’m okay.

00:34:29.984 --> 00:34:31.564
I’m willing to accept the consequences.

00:34:32.324 --> 00:34:33.491
I chose to do it.

00:34:34.782 --> 00:34:35.776
I knew it.

00:34:37.075 --> 00:34:38.140
I can’t.

00:34:38.347 --> 00:34:39.489
But you must.

00:34:41.855 --> 00:34:42.651
Thua.

00:34:43.573 --> 00:34:47.405
I hate to see Aye covering for Akk like this.

00:34:49.671 --> 00:34:52.155
You don’t have to do the same for me, Kan.

00:35:01.497 --> 00:35:02.297
Got it.

00:35:06.078 --> 00:35:07.094
I’m going home.

00:35:08.278 --> 00:35:09.886
My mom has been waiting.

00:35:10.506 --> 00:35:11.336
Wait.

00:35:15.763 --> 00:35:17.486
Why did you change so much?

00:35:19.726 --> 00:35:20.896
I think I just feel ashamed

00:35:22.838 --> 00:35:25.524
seeing younger students make such sacrifices and then be threatened.

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:32.451
I think every change requires sacrifice.

00:35:35.648 --> 00:35:40.276
If my bad action could change anything at all,

00:35:42.992 --> 00:35:44.162
it was worth it.

00:36:06.175 --> 00:36:06.999
What are you thinking about?

00:36:27.317 --> 00:36:28.888
You didn’t ask me to come along.

00:36:31.141 --> 00:36:32.195
Why did you follow me here?

00:36:32.701 --> 00:36:34.011
To keep you company, as a boyfriend.

00:36:43.707 --> 00:36:44.508
What are you thinking?

00:36:48.837 --> 00:36:53.872
I’m just thinking beliefs have a huge influence on us humans.

00:36:54.781 --> 00:36:55.600
Exactly.

00:36:57.205 --> 00:37:00.427
Beliefs determine what people do.

00:37:02.162 --> 00:37:09.263
Some people even believe that their own thoughts and actions are the only ones that are right.

00:37:11.432 --> 00:37:15.168
Sometimes, that violates other people’s rights.

00:37:18.172 --> 00:37:19.636
Like me before I met you.

00:37:21.949 --> 00:37:23.581
Actually, you changed me too somehow.

00:37:24.253 --> 00:37:25.141
Me?

00:37:25.398 --> 00:37:26.167
Yes.

00:37:26.795 --> 00:37:29.652
Before this, I liked to stereotype people.

00:37:31.749 --> 00:37:37.328
When I saw people like you, I would flag immediately that I hate this guy.

00:37:37.557 --> 00:37:38.509
I hate this type of person.

00:37:40.545 --> 00:37:42.129
We are totally different.

00:37:43.029 --> 00:37:43.768
True.

00:37:53.556 --> 00:37:54.613
About this morning,

00:37:55.602 --> 00:37:56.488
what are you going to do?

00:38:02.247 --> 00:38:03.926
You and you

00:38:04.165 --> 00:38:05.385
must be actors in my short film.

00:38:06.692 --> 00:38:07.536
No.

00:38:08.061 --> 00:38:09.525
If you don’t do it,

00:38:09.782 --> 00:38:14.440
people will think Wat, Kan, and Aye are lying to cover what you did.

00:38:14.941 --> 00:38:15.622
Yes.

00:38:16.142 --> 00:38:17.413
He got a point.

00:38:18.575 --> 00:38:22.568
By the way, how did you end up in our meeting?

00:38:24.916 --> 00:38:26.680
I want to work with you.

00:38:26.968 --> 00:38:27.590
Please.

00:38:28.212 --> 00:38:29.590
Let me join the team.

00:38:31.302 --> 00:38:32.723
What do you say, director?

00:38:34.781 --> 00:38:35.457
Okay.

00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:39.781
But you can’t just go around and do anything without telling us again.

00:38:42.372 --> 00:38:45.658
I told them you continued doing the fake curse after me.

00:38:48.558 --> 00:38:49.781
I’m sorry.

00:38:51.698 --> 00:38:55.755
I promise if I get accepted, I won’t do that again.

00:38:58.648 --> 00:38:59.309
Fine.

00:39:00.402 --> 00:39:01.701
You gave us the promise.

00:39:04.906 --> 00:39:07.142
Thua, you’re a good writer.

00:39:07.634 --> 00:39:09.055
Write the script for me.

00:39:09.782 --> 00:39:10.487
Sure.

00:39:10.487 --> 00:39:12.275
But isn’t it a documentary movie?

00:39:12.841 --> 00:39:14.541
You want me to add the fictional part to it?

00:39:15.228 --> 00:39:15.915
Yes.

00:39:16.137 --> 00:39:17.451
I think it would make it more interesting.

00:39:18.022 --> 00:39:20.193
What should the story be about?

00:39:21.375 --> 00:39:24.461
How about you and Kan?

00:39:25.621 --> 00:39:26.759
Me and Kan?

00:39:26.759 --> 00:39:27.428
Yeah.

00:39:28.073 --> 00:39:30.341
And Akk and Aye.

00:39:31.435 --> 00:39:32.320
Me too.

00:39:34.034 --> 00:39:35.749
I’ve never written a screenplay before.

00:39:36.189 --> 00:39:38.301
I don’t know if it will be good.

00:39:38.437 --> 00:39:39.335
It’s okay.

00:39:39.781 --> 00:39:40.883
I’ll help you.

00:39:41.422 --> 00:39:42.972
I’m the director’s assistant anyway.

00:39:43.715 --> 00:39:44.515
Hold on.

00:39:45.101 --> 00:39:46.965
If I agree to be in your film,

00:39:47.749 --> 00:39:50.096
that means I’m announcing to the world

00:39:51.168 --> 00:39:52.026
that I am…

00:39:52.026 --> 00:39:53.417
A BL film actor.

00:39:53.521 --> 00:39:55.157
I think that’s great.

00:39:55.638 --> 00:39:57.788
It’s Thailand’s soft power.

00:40:04.193 --> 00:40:05.183
I think I will do it.

00:40:06.062 --> 00:40:07.822
Wat and Kan helped me after all.

00:40:09.408 --> 00:40:10.068
Um.

00:40:11.042 --> 00:40:12.528
Before we play any roles,

00:40:14.075 --> 00:40:15.411
let’s play in the water first.

00:40:17.036 --> 00:40:17.922
In the water?

00:40:20.850 --> 00:40:22.461
Aye!

00:40:22.976 --> 00:40:24.526
Get down here.

00:40:36.782 --> 00:40:39.918
Hey, do you want me to add anything to this scene?

00:40:42.614 --> 00:40:43.655
I think it’s okay.

00:40:45.862 --> 00:40:49.606
Are you going to write the part where I asked you to be my boyfriend but told you to keep it a secret?

00:40:51.051 --> 00:40:52.206
I think I am.

00:40:52.913 --> 00:40:54.401
Are you okay though?

00:40:55.373 --> 00:40:56.387
If not…

00:40:56.387 --> 00:40:57.373
I’m okay.

00:40:58.202 --> 00:40:59.122
Go ahead.

00:41:01.141 --> 00:41:01.900
Ah.

00:41:13.632 --> 00:41:14.564
Guys.

00:41:16.043 --> 00:41:19.597
If you want to stare, stare away.

00:41:22.305 --> 00:41:26.127
If you have any questions for us, ask away.

00:41:27.602 --> 00:41:30.095
You guys want to know what we are?

00:41:30.637 --> 00:41:32.894
Kan, keep it down. Don’t bother other students.

00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:55.447
We are boyfriends.

00:42:02.148 --> 00:42:03.387
You don’t look convinced.

00:42:04.551 --> 00:42:05.651
I’ll show you with this hug.

00:42:13.776 --> 00:42:15.261
You still don’t look very convinced.

00:42:15.499 --> 00:42:16.594
I’ll show you with this cheek kiss.

00:42:19.438 --> 00:42:20.343
Enough.

00:42:22.023 --> 00:42:23.901
It was not convincing enough, was it?

00:42:24.618 --> 00:42:25.520
I’ll just prove it with this kiss.

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:26.581
That’s enough.

00:42:26.581 --> 00:42:27.600
Enough.

00:42:28.062 --> 00:42:28.926
Sit down.

00:42:28.926 --> 00:42:29.633
This is embarrassing.

00:42:36.444 --> 00:42:38.530
You two face each other.

00:42:39.578 --> 00:42:44.300
Imagine the person in front of you to be the one you love the most.

00:42:44.608 --> 00:42:46.981
Now close your eyes.

00:42:47.118 --> 00:42:49.525
Touch each other’s faces.

00:42:49.525 --> 00:42:53.596
Picture him as the most important person in your life.

00:42:59.251 --> 00:43:00.028
Aye.

00:43:00.521 --> 00:43:01.744
Focus.

00:43:01.851 --> 00:43:02.545
Yeah.

00:43:03.331 --> 00:43:07.731
Now slowly open your eyes.

00:43:10.084 --> 00:43:13.884
And tell him how you feel.

00:43:15.837 --> 00:43:16.765
I love you.

00:43:18.850 --> 00:43:19.993
More and more every day.

00:43:24.057 --> 00:43:26.221
Aye, what are you saying?

00:43:26.221 --> 00:43:27.240
The camera is rolling.

00:43:27.753 --> 00:43:28.510
Akk.

00:43:32.042 --> 00:43:33.335
Who sent you to mess with this school?

00:43:34.047 --> 00:43:35.261
Your old school?

00:43:40.833 --> 00:43:41.832
What are you doing?

00:43:42.689 --> 00:43:44.183
Your pin tilts.

00:43:45.035 --> 00:43:46.137
Let me fix it for you.

00:43:46.909 --> 00:43:52.072
So you’d look like The Prefect Club president again.

00:43:55.293 --> 00:43:56.311
Cut.

00:43:58.411 --> 00:43:59.586
Good acting.

00:44:00.233 --> 00:44:00.936
Right, Thua?

00:44:00.936 --> 00:44:01.539
Yeah.

00:44:01.539 --> 00:44:02.404
Great job.

00:44:03.218 --> 00:44:07.221
The next scene will be filmed at the school’s bleachers.

00:44:09.530 --> 00:44:10.390
We acted so well.

00:44:11.119 --> 00:44:12.152
It wasn’t that difficult.

00:44:13.249 --> 00:44:13.985
No.

00:44:14.781 --> 00:44:16.341
So did you fall for me first?

00:44:19.421 --> 00:44:21.057
Don’t be ridiculous.

00:44:23.260 --> 00:44:24.821
You liked me first.

00:44:24.974 --> 00:44:25.967
I liked you later.

00:44:30.001 --> 00:44:31.007
What are you smiling at?

00:44:33.557 --> 00:44:37.037
It’s the very first time you said you like me.

00:44:40.622 --> 00:44:41.486
Sounds very nice.

00:44:42.953 --> 00:44:43.930
Shut up.

00:44:46.202 --> 00:44:46.968
All right.

00:44:49.257 --> 00:44:51.257
This way I can listen to your heartbeat closely.

00:44:52.201 --> 00:44:53.172
It’s clear.

00:44:56.678 --> 00:44:58.249
Thump, thump, thump.

00:45:01.998 --> 00:45:02.706
Aye.

00:45:02.706 --> 00:45:03.443
What?

00:45:07.665 --> 00:45:08.284
You like it.

00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:11.221
Stop talking.

00:45:18.535 --> 00:45:24.371
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

00:45:24.927 --> 00:45:28.621
Every battle leads to a change.

00:45:28.621 --> 00:45:32.866
If we want Suppalo to still stand, it must adjust.

00:45:33.074 --> 00:45:36.874
If I could choose anything, I would choose to tell you…

00:45:37.445 --> 00:45:38.653
Hug me tight.

00:45:38.953 --> 00:45:40.195
In case you have a nightmare again tonight.
