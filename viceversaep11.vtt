00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:23.769
Is pink something that can take us home?

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:27.154
Tun!

00:00:28.139 --> 00:00:29.254
I dreamed.

00:00:29.254 --> 00:00:30.566
We’re going home.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:32.622
Don’t tell me

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.644
you’re Pakorn.

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:39.209
I don’t know when we will get to go home.

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.639
But no matter where you’ll be,

00:00:41.639 --> 00:00:44.401
I promise I’ll look for you.

00:00:45.633 --> 00:00:47.633
ONE DAY EARLIER

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:48.605
Puen,

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:53.301
in this scene, the athlete will walk in and punch you with his left fist.

00:00:53.301 --> 00:00:55.325
Just like we rehearsed it, okay?

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:59.224
Once you got punched, you pretend to fall into the pool.

00:00:59.224 --> 00:01:01.557
But don’t really go in there because it's dangerous.

00:01:01.557 --> 00:01:02.993
Thank you, guys. Good luck.

00:01:02.993 --> 00:01:03.992
Thanks, Pramote.

00:01:05.153 --> 00:01:06.760
I’m Joe.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.000
Why do you keep calling me Pramote? I just don’t get it.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.903
I have a friend who looks like you named Pramote.

00:01:12.903 --> 00:01:13.881
- Looks like me?
- Yes.

00:01:13.881 --> 00:01:14.615
So he's hot?

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:15.775
If you say so.

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:17.277
Okay. Let’s start.

00:01:17.617 --> 00:01:18.838
All set.

00:01:18.838 --> 00:01:20.168
Pramote?

00:01:20.852 --> 00:01:21.846
Ready?

00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:23.722
Ready?

00:01:24.712 --> 00:01:26.136
Sound?

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.965
Camera?

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.304
And…action.

00:01:37.952 --> 00:01:39.003
Hey!

00:01:44.245 --> 00:01:45.040
Shit!

00:01:45.203 --> 00:01:46.520
Puen is drowning!

00:01:54.696 --> 00:01:56.120
Go in and help him, Joe.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.588
Joe, jump in.

00:01:57.955 --> 00:01:59.955
Why did you literally punch him?

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.140
Talay.

00:02:23.511 --> 00:02:24.571
He’s conscious.

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.238
Talay.

00:02:29.814 --> 00:02:30.906
Where’s Talay?

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.960
We’re not going to the sea.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.227
We’re going to a hospital.

00:02:36.118 --> 00:02:37.406
What’s happening?

00:02:38.034 --> 00:02:39.458
Don’t you remember at all?

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:41.833
We were filming a movie and there was an accident.

00:02:42.192 --> 00:02:44.599
Luckily, nothing serious happened, Puen.

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:55.567
What did you just call me?

00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:57.142
Puen.

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:00.822
Are you having amnesia after getting punched?

00:03:04.337 --> 00:03:05.625
Easy, Puen.

00:03:06.366 --> 00:03:07.959
We’re going to a hospital.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:18.577
Am I back?

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.380
I’ll postpone the filming.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.836
Rest in a hospital for a few days.

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:27.336
No.

00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:29.224
Puen!

00:03:29.224 --> 00:03:30.000
Calm down.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.876
Easy, Puen.

00:03:30.876 --> 00:03:32.454
I need to go find someone.

00:03:32.454 --> 00:03:33.359
Lie down.

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.412
We’re nearly at the hospital.

00:03:35.412 --> 00:03:37.036
I’m not going. I’m fine.

00:03:37.036 --> 00:03:38.535
Stop the car!

00:03:38.535 --> 00:03:41.012
Oh, come on. Lie back down.

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.876
You’re not fine, Puen.

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:45.395
Hey, stop the car!

00:03:45.395 --> 00:03:46.704
Puen, pull yourself together.

00:03:46.704 --> 00:03:47.892
Lie down.

00:03:49.731 --> 00:03:52.985
Talay!

00:03:52.985 --> 00:03:53.909
Tie him.

00:03:55.597 --> 00:03:57.597
Sorry, Puen.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.762
Stop the car.

00:03:59.762 --> 00:04:01.915
Stay put.

00:04:02.064 --> 00:04:03.657
Talay!

00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:14.093
How did you get back here?

00:05:18.549 --> 00:05:20.176
The other day, I dreamt.

00:05:22.463 --> 00:05:24.226
I dreamt of a place.

00:05:26.445 --> 00:05:27.944
The next day,

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:31.121
I went there to film a movie.

00:05:33.632 --> 00:05:35.768
They happen to be in the same location.

00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:41.409
I accidentally fell into a pool.

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.753
Once I woke up,

00:05:46.531 --> 00:05:48.158
I’m here.

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:04.755
That means Tun suddenly went back

00:06:06.848 --> 00:06:08.408
because you came back.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:15.947
It’s just like Dol said.

00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:18.074
You must dream

00:06:19.463 --> 00:06:21.082
and go to the place in your dream

00:06:21.892 --> 00:06:23.350
in order to return.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.365
Why do you call him Tun though?

00:06:33.585 --> 00:06:35.348
That’s my name.

00:06:40.582 --> 00:06:41.751
It’s a long story.

00:06:42.582 --> 00:06:47.343
Let’s say I call him Tun in this universe.

00:06:48.228 --> 00:06:49.821
And I call you Pakorn.

00:06:54.505 --> 00:06:55.997
Tess. Tun.

00:06:57.233 --> 00:06:58.340
Time to head back.

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:00.000
We’ve cleaned up everything.

00:07:01.064 --> 00:07:01.920
Sure.

00:07:02.225 --> 00:07:03.979
I’m coming.

00:07:04.565 --> 00:07:05.617
Shit!

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.490
Up and Aou.

00:07:08.005 --> 00:07:10.005
I missed them so damn much.

00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:11.176
Wait.

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:15.320
Tun hasn’t told me his real name.

00:07:16.738 --> 00:07:18.569
You know his name, don’t you?

00:07:22.041 --> 00:07:22.955
Of course.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.984
What’s his name?

00:07:29.483 --> 00:07:30.389
I think…

00:07:31.236 --> 00:07:33.200
he was trying to tell you.

00:07:51.635 --> 00:07:53.635
[Puen]

00:08:29.455 --> 00:08:30.463
Aou.

00:08:33.648 --> 00:08:34.640
Up.

00:08:36.157 --> 00:08:37.344
Took you forever to come.

00:08:39.851 --> 00:08:41.120
Up!

00:08:41.698 --> 00:08:42.885
Hold on.

00:08:42.885 --> 00:08:43.970
I missed you.

00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:45.487
Is it really you?

00:08:45.487 --> 00:08:46.833
I freaking missed you.

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.970
I missed you so freaking much!

00:08:48.970 --> 00:08:51.306
Missed, my ass! We see each other every day.

00:08:52.012 --> 00:08:53.087
Are you sober yet?

00:08:54.307 --> 00:08:55.944
Don’t mind me.

00:08:57.820 --> 00:08:58.789
Aou!

00:08:58.789 --> 00:08:59.820
Don’t slap me.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.087
Aou!

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:03.438
I f*cking missed you.

00:09:03.438 --> 00:09:04.744
I feel like I haven’t seen you in ages.

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.683
Do not play dumb.

00:09:07.409 --> 00:09:09.409
Are you still drunk?

00:09:09.409 --> 00:09:10.877
Go clean up.

00:09:13.763 --> 00:09:14.782
Hurry up.

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.796
Take the sign and we hit the road.

00:09:19.173 --> 00:09:20.207
Come on.

00:09:21.393 --> 00:09:22.359
Tun.

00:09:26.724 --> 00:09:30.757
Guys, you can head back.

00:09:31.647 --> 00:09:33.986
I have to go somewhere first.

00:09:34.816 --> 00:09:36.138
Where are you going?

00:09:36.858 --> 00:09:37.984
Doesn’t matter.

00:09:39.475 --> 00:09:40.925
I’ve got something to do.

00:09:42.001 --> 00:09:43.493
I’ll see you later.

00:09:44.492 --> 00:09:46.323
I love you all.

00:09:47.733 --> 00:09:49.597
Here comes another weirdo.

00:09:49.597 --> 00:09:51.011
What’s up with you two today?

00:09:52.161 --> 00:09:53.316
So you’re traveling?

00:09:53.316 --> 00:09:55.686
Here is your bag.

00:09:57.312 --> 00:09:58.309
Hand it to him.

00:10:07.692 --> 00:10:08.811
Good luck.

00:10:21.706 --> 00:10:23.120
Let’s go.

00:11:00.525 --> 00:11:01.780
Excuse me.

00:11:02.406 --> 00:11:04.745
Is there any employee named Talay here?

00:11:05.633 --> 00:11:06.755
Talay?

00:11:08.449 --> 00:11:10.818
I don’t we have anyone by that name.

00:11:13.336 --> 00:11:15.240
He’s a colorist.

00:11:15.421 --> 00:11:16.981
A colorist?

00:11:18.488 --> 00:11:21.504
Ah! That guy.

00:11:21.973 --> 00:11:24.360
He left us months ago.

00:11:26.628 --> 00:11:29.800
Do you have his address or contact?

00:11:30.646 --> 00:11:32.138
Please.

00:11:33.095 --> 00:11:34.655
I can’t reach him.

00:11:36.001 --> 00:11:38.611
Please help. I really want to see him.

00:11:40.271 --> 00:11:41.474
Please.

00:12:02.788 --> 00:12:03.805
You.

00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:18.638
I finally found you.

00:12:24.611 --> 00:12:26.238
What the heck?

00:12:47.273 --> 00:12:48.731
Are you Tess?

00:12:49.156 --> 00:12:51.427
Yes, I’m Tess.

00:12:54.728 --> 00:12:57.440
Don’t tell me you’re Puen.

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.316
Why don’t I and Talay switch back?

00:13:29.593 --> 00:13:30.625
Uncle.

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.067
Can you take me to that island?

00:13:34.592 --> 00:13:37.880
Come on. We can’t go now.

00:13:38.314 --> 00:13:41.059
The tide is high.

00:13:41.059 --> 00:13:43.307
You must wait until it’s lower.

00:13:43.307 --> 00:13:45.020
I’ve got work to do.

00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:47.421
When will it be lower?

00:13:48.507 --> 00:13:50.507
I can’t tell the exact time.

00:13:50.507 --> 00:13:52.442
Might be a week.

00:13:52.772 --> 00:13:54.772
Sometimes you have to wait a month.

00:13:56.182 --> 00:13:57.775
Hold on, Uncle.

00:13:57.775 --> 00:13:59.013
I’m in a rush.

00:13:59.763 --> 00:14:02.480
I’ll book accommodation around here.

00:14:02.762 --> 00:14:04.288
Once the tide is low,

00:14:04.288 --> 00:14:07.160
please let me know.

00:14:07.478 --> 00:14:08.766
Fine.

00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:10.562
I’ll keep an eye on the water level for you.

00:14:10.562 --> 00:14:12.210
Come and check again some other time.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.154
Thank you.

00:14:32.167 --> 00:14:33.286
Hello.

00:14:33.625 --> 00:14:34.554
(Yeah.)

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.322
Why are you calling again?

00:14:37.322 --> 00:14:39.274
I told you Talay hasn’t come back yet.

00:14:40.449 --> 00:14:43.330
(At least I get to hear his voice.)

00:14:43.969 --> 00:14:45.760
(Though you’re not really him.)

00:14:46.562 --> 00:14:47.780
You’re so drunk in love.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:49.172
Why don’t you come and look at my face?

00:14:50.103 --> 00:14:50.946
(You said it yourself.)

00:14:52.572 --> 00:14:53.729
Shit!

00:14:53.729 --> 00:14:55.072
How did you get in here?

00:14:55.308 --> 00:14:56.800
I saw no one else is home.

00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.033
So I climbed over the fence.

00:14:59.226 --> 00:15:01.565
I’m going to share this on Twitter.

00:15:01.565 --> 00:15:04.379
A crazy-in-love actor breaks into his crush’s home.

00:15:08.288 --> 00:15:13.270
It’s worth it if I get to see Talay’s face a little longer.

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:15.223
What on earth?

00:15:17.356 --> 00:15:19.240
Stop looking at me, jackass.

00:15:33.157 --> 00:15:34.396
What the heck?

00:15:35.311 --> 00:15:36.546
I’m playing a mobile game.

00:15:36.546 --> 00:15:37.732
You just ruined my mood.

00:15:39.771 --> 00:15:41.480
It can’t be fun playing alone.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.762
Here. I’ll play it with you.

00:15:44.005 --> 00:15:45.022
What’s up with you?

00:15:46.953 --> 00:15:48.067
Here.

00:15:57.076 --> 00:15:58.093
Hey.

00:15:58.483 --> 00:16:02.414
If Talay comes back, how will he contact me?

00:16:02.989 --> 00:16:04.752
Have him call you.

00:16:06.327 --> 00:16:09.377
I’m not even sure if he knows my name.

00:16:11.005 --> 00:16:11.916
Let’s do this.

00:16:12.492 --> 00:16:14.733
Can you leave him a post-it note?

00:16:16.321 --> 00:16:17.459
What now?

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.757
You broke into my house and order me around.

00:16:21.972 --> 00:16:23.520
There’s no post-it note here.

00:16:32.921 --> 00:16:34.379
Please help, sir.

00:16:51.041 --> 00:16:52.262
Happy?

00:16:54.117 --> 00:16:55.710
Now leave.

00:16:56.317 --> 00:16:58.317
My mom and my brother will be back soon.

00:16:58.738 --> 00:17:00.000
Why?

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:03.120
Can’t I wait around to greet them?

00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:03.946
No.

00:17:04.468 --> 00:17:06.366
I don’t want to answer their questions.

00:17:07.349 --> 00:17:08.807
Go already.

00:17:09.977 --> 00:17:11.002
Okay.

00:17:11.578 --> 00:17:12.960
Wait.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:13.828
What?

00:17:13.828 --> 00:17:14.758
Where are you going?

00:17:15.051 --> 00:17:16.200
I’m leaving.

00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.352
Do it like when you entered.

00:17:20.455 --> 00:17:22.040
You want me to climb over the fence?

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:22.922
Yes.

00:17:23.167 --> 00:17:24.218
No.

00:17:24.603 --> 00:17:26.366
Do it.

00:17:28.763 --> 00:17:30.200
You will pay for it.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.477
I’ll climb again.

00:17:31.477 --> 00:17:32.891
Don’t step on my grass.

00:17:39.022 --> 00:17:41.767
[When you’re back, call a guy named Puen.]

00:17:41.767 --> 00:17:43.164
[His number is on your contact list.]

00:17:53.734 --> 00:17:57.631
Why did you give me an hourglass?

00:17:57.912 --> 00:18:02.216
It’s an indicator of how long we’re together.

00:18:02.727 --> 00:18:04.727
Though we’re apart.

00:18:04.727 --> 00:18:07.790
I will meet again someday

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.779
and spend time together once more.

00:18:10.295 --> 00:18:12.000
Just like this hourglass.

00:18:12.210 --> 00:18:15.640
It goes from one side to the other.

00:18:16.484 --> 00:18:18.480
Like our universal traveling.

00:18:41.136 --> 00:18:42.285
Uncle.

00:18:42.454 --> 00:18:44.080
Do you get the low tide yet?

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:45.294
You again?

00:18:45.294 --> 00:18:46.560
Take it easy.

00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:47.624
it’s still high.

00:18:47.624 --> 00:18:49.409
Just wait.

00:18:49.591 --> 00:18:51.083
I’ll take you there.

00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.000
Talay?

00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:21.130
ONE MONTH LATER

00:21:22.739 --> 00:21:24.332
Damn you, the ocean tide!

00:21:24.993 --> 00:21:26.891
When will you go lower?

00:22:11.534 --> 00:22:13.640
Aren’t you gonna say what you wished for?

00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.049
Don’t break the rule.

00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:16.261
Tell us.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.593
I won’t.

00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:20.033
Tess is the only one allowed to know.

00:22:50.832 --> 00:22:55.983
(That day, in the glass house, I’ve fallen head over heels in love with you.)

00:23:12.327 --> 00:23:13.378
So?

00:23:14.347 --> 00:23:15.737
Will they fall in love?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.187
I guess they will.

00:23:37.303 --> 00:23:38.492
Son.

00:23:38.695 --> 00:23:39.879
Stop.

00:23:39.879 --> 00:23:42.090
Calm down.

00:23:42.219 --> 00:23:43.469
Where are you going?

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:45.371
To see Tun.

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:46.990
Let me go.

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:48.074
Calm down.

00:23:48.262 --> 00:23:49.754
Don’t lose your mind.

00:23:49.754 --> 00:23:51.086
Pull yourself together.

00:23:51.086 --> 00:23:54.138
I checked the water level on the other side.

00:23:54.874 --> 00:23:56.874
The tide is getting lower there.

00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.715
If you really wish to go, I’ll take you.

00:24:16.386 --> 00:24:17.667
I have a question.

00:24:18.209 --> 00:24:21.672
What’s the first thing you’ll do when you go back?

00:24:24.224 --> 00:24:25.716
Look for you.

00:24:26.309 --> 00:24:28.309
No. I mean…

00:24:29.517 --> 00:24:31.381
What’s your dream?

00:24:32.652 --> 00:24:34.212
Still, look for you.

00:24:34.737 --> 00:24:37.991
Because my dream is to be with you.

00:24:39.017 --> 00:24:40.054
Yuck.

00:24:40.427 --> 00:24:41.390
Cheesy.

00:24:42.033 --> 00:24:42.949
What about you?

00:24:43.717 --> 00:24:46.835
What’s the first thing you’ll do when you go back?

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.280
Look for you as well.

00:24:57.065 --> 00:24:58.209
Yuck.

00:24:58.785 --> 00:25:00.691
You’re as cheesy as I am.

00:25:10.006 --> 00:25:11.633
Let’s make a promise then.

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:17.280
Let’s promise to find each other when we go back.

00:25:18.619 --> 00:25:19.822
Promise?

00:25:26.666 --> 00:25:27.689
I promise.

00:25:54.505 --> 00:25:55.793
Are you going out looking for a job?

00:25:55.793 --> 00:25:57.697
Aren’t I working for BFB?

00:25:57.697 --> 00:25:58.645
You were.

00:25:58.645 --> 00:26:00.059
But that was two years ago.

00:26:00.059 --> 00:26:01.427
What’s my job then?

00:26:01.427 --> 00:26:04.291
You became a manager of an actor named Puen.

00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:43.570
Talay,

00:27:44.262 --> 00:27:45.618
are you awake?

00:27:45.618 --> 00:27:47.079
It’s time to eat.

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.750
Why didn’t you answer me?

00:28:12.036 --> 00:28:13.617
Come on. Time for breakfast.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.260
Talay.

00:28:36.014 --> 00:28:37.074
What’s going on?

00:28:42.609 --> 00:28:43.855
Why are you crying?

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:44.899
What’s wrong?

00:28:56.323 --> 00:28:57.335
Talay.

00:28:59.095 --> 00:29:00.083
Are you okay?

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.672
Is there a problem?

00:29:13.491 --> 00:29:15.156
You can tell me.

00:29:15.573 --> 00:29:17.091
Nothing, Mom.

00:29:18.182 --> 00:29:19.972
I just missed you.

00:29:23.191 --> 00:29:24.583
You had a nightmare, didn’t you?

00:29:26.986 --> 00:29:28.127
It’s okay.

00:29:31.104 --> 00:29:32.161
Here it is.

00:29:34.837 --> 00:29:36.648
Why do you want to eat a Basil Stir-Fried dish now?

00:29:36.753 --> 00:29:38.879
You’ve been saying you hate it.

00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:42.162
Nothing.

00:29:42.728 --> 00:29:43.671
I just want to eat it.

00:29:44.596 --> 00:29:46.596
I miss your food.

00:29:48.202 --> 00:29:51.313
You eat my food every day.

00:29:51.313 --> 00:29:52.814
You don’t make any sense.

00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:58.604
Mom, I’ve bought the ice cubes.

00:29:58.604 --> 00:29:59.485
Alright.

00:29:59.625 --> 00:30:00.708
Ice cubes are here.

00:30:00.708 --> 00:30:01.667
Put them right there.

00:30:03.387 --> 00:30:05.157
It’s scorching outside.

00:30:05.929 --> 00:30:06.965
So hot.

00:30:14.039 --> 00:30:15.033
What’s up?

00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:17.716
Why are you staring at me?

00:30:20.146 --> 00:30:20.910
Oh, did you…

00:30:23.530 --> 00:30:27.562
find out I took money from your piggy bank?

00:30:28.239 --> 00:30:29.484
I’m sorry.

00:30:31.058 --> 00:30:33.058
Once I get the money, I’ll pay you back.

00:30:33.058 --> 00:30:34.605
Don’t tell Mom.

00:30:34.605 --> 00:30:36.426
I’m in need.

00:30:41.070 --> 00:30:42.169
Take it.

00:30:46.987 --> 00:30:47.710
Damn!

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:49.364
Who are you?

00:30:50.221 --> 00:30:51.651
Where is my hot-headed little bro?

00:30:52.510 --> 00:30:53.499
Are you real?

00:30:54.876 --> 00:30:55.746
You’re weird.

00:30:55.872 --> 00:30:56.772
Exactly.

00:30:56.898 --> 00:30:59.400
Like he’s back to being him two years ago.

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.350
My cute and calm Talay.

00:31:02.957 --> 00:31:03.993
He’s back.

00:31:07.912 --> 00:31:09.828
What happened to you today?

00:31:10.271 --> 00:31:11.768
Why did you get up early?

00:31:12.466 --> 00:31:13.843
Are you going out looking for a job?

00:31:14.466 --> 00:31:15.340
Looking for a job?

00:31:16.442 --> 00:31:18.442
Aren’t I working for BFB?

00:31:18.444 --> 00:31:19.513
You were.

00:31:20.476 --> 00:31:22.057
But that was two years ago.

00:31:22.959 --> 00:31:24.037
Did you forget?

00:31:24.185 --> 00:31:25.924
You quit a long time ago.

00:31:27.758 --> 00:31:28.566
Wait.

00:31:30.243 --> 00:31:31.435
What’s my job then?

00:31:32.682 --> 00:31:36.505
You became a manager of an actor named Puen.

00:31:37.177 --> 00:31:38.632
But it was brief.

00:31:38.812 --> 00:31:42.153
You were fired and are now jobless.

00:31:43.774 --> 00:31:44.450
Hey.

00:31:45.938 --> 00:31:48.016
Why am I telling your own story?

00:31:48.467 --> 00:31:49.212
Hold on.

00:31:50.364 --> 00:31:53.274
What did you say the actor’s name was again?

00:31:54.670 --> 00:31:55.432
Puen.

00:31:57.108 --> 00:31:58.346
What’s up with you?

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.044
You need a hand, Mom?

00:32:02.228 --> 00:32:03.112
Take this.

00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:03.956
Sure.

00:32:38.266 --> 00:32:38.988
Puen.

00:33:05.598 --> 00:33:06.362
Talay?

00:33:43.028 --> 00:33:45.028
Thank you. Thank you.

00:33:47.884 --> 00:33:50.844
Guys, please make some room.

00:33:50.844 --> 00:33:51.874
Leave your presents with me.

00:33:52.164 --> 00:33:54.164
Puen, get inside. Let Puen take some rest, guys.

00:33:54.164 --> 00:33:55.317
Will you excuse me?

00:33:55.317 --> 00:33:57.899
Bye, guys.

00:34:00.261 --> 00:34:02.261
You guys go wait over there.

00:34:02.422 --> 00:34:04.611
This evening, when he’s done working, we will take photos again.

00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:05.836
Go back for now.

00:34:05.836 --> 00:34:07.662
Bye, guys. Thank you so much.

00:34:07.662 --> 00:34:09.655
See you. Go before it rains.

00:34:09.655 --> 00:34:11.152
See you.

00:35:00.469 --> 00:35:02.155
How dare you come back to Puen?

00:35:05.046 --> 00:35:06.459
Hold on. I…

00:35:06.459 --> 00:35:08.004
You caused him a lot of financial damage.

00:35:08.738 --> 00:35:10.005
You’re thick-skinned to come back.

00:35:11.452 --> 00:35:12.970
Are you asking for a chance?

00:35:14.396 --> 00:35:16.019
This isn’t about work.

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.534
Can I see Puen for a moment?

00:35:29.485 --> 00:35:31.213
Puen would never want to see you.

00:35:32.931 --> 00:35:34.114
I won’t let it happen either.

00:35:34.953 --> 00:35:36.345
He’s lost so much.

00:35:37.604 --> 00:35:39.374
And he’s been hurt enough.

00:35:49.204 --> 00:35:51.204
What did this Tess dude do now?

00:35:53.756 --> 00:35:54.834
Damn it.

00:36:01.978 --> 00:36:03.789
I came for one more chance.

00:36:03.789 --> 00:36:05.839
I’m sorry I suddenly quit.

00:36:06.251 --> 00:36:08.167
Arm left these movie premiere tickets for you.

00:36:08.167 --> 00:36:10.137
We will meet for sure this time.

00:36:42.691 --> 00:36:46.220
Seriously, why did you call us out?

00:36:47.669 --> 00:36:49.351
I thought you unfriended us all.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:51.761
Unfriend what?

00:36:52.617 --> 00:36:54.532
You guys are my close friends.

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:55.903
Close, my ass.

00:36:56.091 --> 00:36:58.452
You’d never reached out to us in these past two years.

00:36:58.452 --> 00:36:59.631
You’d been gone.

00:37:00.144 --> 00:37:03.736
You became Puen’s manager without telling Gyo at all.

00:37:04.057 --> 00:37:05.271
She was furious.

00:37:06.722 --> 00:37:08.722
Sorry, all of you.

00:37:11.063 --> 00:37:12.111
I’m back.

00:37:13.491 --> 00:37:15.165
I know I’m horrible.

00:37:16.481 --> 00:37:17.674
But you know what?

00:37:20.017 --> 00:37:22.527
There wasn't a day that went by that I didn't think of you.

00:37:26.415 --> 00:37:27.547
Fine.

00:37:27.781 --> 00:37:33.290
At least you’re the one who assembled the five of us again.

00:37:34.996 --> 00:37:35.828
Forget the past.

00:37:36.539 --> 00:37:37.860
To our friendship.

00:37:38.711 --> 00:37:40.838
Cheers!

00:37:45.762 --> 00:37:46.570
Damn.

00:37:47.131 --> 00:37:48.388
Took you so long to come back.

00:37:49.541 --> 00:37:51.541
My dear BBQ pork.

00:37:51.541 --> 00:37:52.834
It is burnt.

00:37:53.971 --> 00:37:54.697
Thank you.

00:37:58.929 --> 00:37:59.872
Arm,

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.417
excuse me.

00:38:01.950 --> 00:38:03.810
There’s one more person wanting to have an interview.

00:38:04.294 --> 00:38:07.653
I tried to stop him but he insisted on giving an interview.

00:38:08.345 --> 00:38:09.138
Who?

00:38:10.709 --> 00:38:11.570
Over there.

00:38:24.763 --> 00:38:26.763
Hello.

00:38:28.495 --> 00:38:29.922
How dare you come back?

00:38:30.587 --> 00:38:32.481
I came for one more chance.

00:38:34.093 --> 00:38:36.666
I’m sorry I suddenly quit.

00:38:38.577 --> 00:38:40.917
We actually liked your profile.

00:38:43.537 --> 00:38:45.855
We just don’t know if we can trust you again.

00:38:46.568 --> 00:38:47.867
Please.

00:38:49.587 --> 00:38:53.392
I wasn’t sure if I loved the job back then.

00:38:53.886 --> 00:38:55.886
But I am now.

00:38:57.295 --> 00:38:59.168
Please give me one more shot.

00:39:02.128 --> 00:39:03.257
Please.

00:39:03.643 --> 00:39:04.570
I’m begging you.

00:39:12.411 --> 00:39:14.008
I’m going to ask you again.

00:39:14.375 --> 00:39:18.753
Why do you like to be a colorist?

00:39:20.014 --> 00:39:21.844
I want to edit the colors for my loved one.

00:39:21.844 --> 00:39:24.038
Sounds like you’re more into love than work.

00:39:24.654 --> 00:39:26.739
It’s not that. I mean…

00:39:26.739 --> 00:39:27.418
But…

00:39:28.171 --> 00:39:29.831
I like your answer.

00:39:31.431 --> 00:39:32.514
It sounds genuine.

00:39:33.639 --> 00:39:36.955
Let’s do this. I’m giving you one more chance.

00:39:37.913 --> 00:39:39.149
Three months probation.

00:39:39.793 --> 00:39:42.791
But if you fail or quit again,

00:39:42.791 --> 00:39:44.781
don’t you ever show your face here again.

00:39:45.862 --> 00:39:49.030
Thank you.

00:39:50.041 --> 00:39:51.765
I will do my best.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:53.473
Please believe me.

00:40:02.147 --> 00:40:03.765
Ah, I found it.

00:40:04.091 --> 00:40:07.726
(It’s the TV show that promotes the movie we’re editing.)

00:40:07.871 --> 00:40:11.422
(If there’re any questions, ask me. I’ll be next door.)

00:40:11.914 --> 00:40:12.846
Sure.

00:40:13.080 --> 00:40:14.148
Thank you, Arm.

00:40:25.479 --> 00:40:27.840
(I heard you’re a very good singer, Puen.)

00:40:28.131 --> 00:40:30.704
(What’s the latest song you sang?)

00:40:32.047 --> 00:40:34.153
The song called Have I Found.

00:40:35.844 --> 00:40:37.844
(Why this song?)

00:40:39.526 --> 00:40:42.885
Actually, someone sang it for me.

00:40:44.167 --> 00:40:45.233
I liked it

00:40:46.153 --> 00:40:47.460
so I practiced singing it.

00:40:52.938 --> 00:40:53.673
What’s bothering you?

00:40:55.618 --> 00:40:57.809
Color editing requires so much thinking.

00:40:58.792 --> 00:41:00.431
I’m resting my brain for a bit.

00:41:02.476 --> 00:41:03.775
Sleep on Daddy’s lap here.

00:41:07.017 --> 00:41:08.359
Why would I do that?

00:41:08.571 --> 00:41:11.970
If you do, I’ll sing you a song.

00:41:12.204 --> 00:41:13.047
Really?

00:41:14.483 --> 00:41:15.506
Fine then.

00:41:23.425 --> 00:41:24.699
What song are you singing?

00:41:37.579 --> 00:41:43.146
♪ Is it you who will turn my world upside down ♪

00:41:43.146 --> 00:41:48.987
♪ Is it you who I’ve been searching for a long time ♪

00:41:48.987 --> 00:41:52.016
♪ Have I found have I found ♪

00:41:52.016 --> 00:41:56.605
♪ Someone who’s ready to take my hand… ♪

00:41:56.605 --> 00:41:58.921
You listened to it just once and remembered all that?

00:42:00.778 --> 00:42:02.205
Everything about you,

00:42:02.369 --> 00:42:03.456
I remember it all.

00:42:20.277 --> 00:42:21.364
Hello, Arm.

00:42:22.512 --> 00:42:25.690
(There’s the movie premiere this Sat. I have two tickets.)

00:42:26.088 --> 00:42:26.984
(Do you want to go?)

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.373
I do.

00:42:31.329 --> 00:42:32.522
Can I have those two tickets?

00:42:40.988 --> 00:42:42.309
Hi, Talay.

00:42:44.014 --> 00:42:45.462
Have you been working all night?

00:42:46.795 --> 00:42:47.818
I have.

00:42:48.497 --> 00:42:49.770
Don’t work too hard.

00:42:50.039 --> 00:42:51.042
Oh, I just realized it.

00:42:51.570 --> 00:42:53.544
Arm left these movie premiere tickets for you.

00:42:55.703 --> 00:42:56.815
Thank you.

00:42:56.815 --> 00:42:57.703
Bye.

00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:48.157
We will meet for sure this time.

00:44:18.307 --> 00:44:19.543
It’s so good.

00:44:20.441 --> 00:44:21.442
The film, right?

00:44:21.867 --> 00:44:22.781
I like it too.

00:44:24.735 --> 00:44:25.426
I mean Puen.

00:44:26.296 --> 00:44:28.603
He’s such a heartthrob.

00:44:28.935 --> 00:44:29.968
His acting is also great.

00:44:29.968 --> 00:44:30.730
Love him.

00:44:32.163 --> 00:44:34.397
Welcome to the Q&amp;A session.

00:44:34.397 --> 00:44:38.070
We’re here with the lead actor of the movie, Puen.

00:44:38.201 --> 00:44:40.330
Please give it up for Puen.

00:44:50.057 --> 00:44:53.090
Before we get to that,

00:44:53.090 --> 00:44:55.324
we need just a little fan service.

00:44:55.399 --> 00:44:56.528
You have a chance to ask two questions.

00:44:56.528 --> 00:44:58.524
What do you want to ask our hero here, guys?

00:44:59.755 --> 00:45:00.906
Raise your hand.

00:45:00.906 --> 00:45:02.307
Ask him anything.

00:45:02.307 --> 00:45:03.586
You  worked for him before.

00:45:16.725 --> 00:45:20.976
Well, our lead actress seems a little jealous.

00:45:21.176 --> 00:45:22.970
You came up on stage just to guard Puen, didn’t you?

00:45:26.979 --> 00:45:30.890
No. I’m just available. 
So I came to help Puen answer the questions.

00:45:33.971 --> 00:45:35.355
You guys are so caring for each other.

00:45:35.355 --> 00:45:37.863
I guess you aren’t just a ship, are you?

00:45:38.218 --> 00:45:40.133
Right!

00:45:41.052 --> 00:45:44.241
You spend a lot of time together.

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:46.561
The fans are rooting for you two.

00:45:55.259 --> 00:45:57.690
Hey, I’ve got something to do.

00:45:58.068 --> 00:45:58.879
I have to go.

00:45:59.268 --> 00:46:00.313
You stay.

00:46:01.570 --> 00:46:02.329
Wait.

00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:03.124
Lay!

00:46:03.247 --> 00:46:04.090
Where are you going?

00:46:24.825 --> 00:46:26.252
I said,

00:46:26.657 --> 00:46:29.730
“I wanted to wake up and see that someone was waiting for me.”

00:46:29.730 --> 00:46:31.735
Is that person still in your life?

00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:33.771
Everything is just the same.

00:47:41.077 --> 00:47:42.723
Excuse me, sir.

00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:50.325
I’d like to use this coupon, please.

00:47:51.227 --> 00:47:52.610
Of course.

00:47:55.372 --> 00:47:58.664
Once it vibrates, you can collect your order at the back.

00:47:58.664 --> 00:47:59.760
Thank you.

00:48:11.302 --> 00:48:12.521
Hey.

00:48:12.521 --> 00:48:14.799
Look at Puen’s smiles.

00:48:14.799 --> 00:48:16.389
So cute.

00:48:16.389 --> 00:48:18.915
They’re dating for real. Trust me.

00:48:18.915 --> 00:48:20.170
Me too.

00:48:22.709 --> 00:48:25.149
(Don’t forget to watch my latest movie.)

00:48:25.149 --> 00:48:28.642
(Everyone involved really did their best.)

00:48:29.569 --> 00:48:31.422
Can you turn up the volume?

00:48:31.422 --> 00:48:33.083
I can’t really hear Puen’s voice.

00:48:33.083 --> 00:48:34.058
You got it.

00:48:34.919 --> 00:48:40.912
(The staff told me there are many viewers watching the live streaming, Puen.)

00:48:41.830 --> 00:48:43.537
(Let’s move on to the next question.)

00:48:45.290 --> 00:48:49.243
(I heard you took part in the screenwriting too, right?)

00:48:49.243 --> 00:48:52.585
What’s your inspiration to do so?

00:48:55.045 --> 00:48:58.278
I got a chance to write a screenplay with three friends of mine.

00:48:59.610 --> 00:49:01.463
It was a valuable moment.

00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:04.708
So I wanted to do that again.

00:49:06.011 --> 00:49:08.686
The scene where you watched the star on the beach,

00:49:08.686 --> 00:49:09.925
your acting was just superb.

00:49:09.925 --> 00:49:12.021
What’s your secret?

00:49:14.907 --> 00:49:17.524
Because I’ve really felt that way about someone before.

00:49:18.909 --> 00:49:20.703
And I’ve said those words before.

00:49:21.724 --> 00:49:22.652
For real?

00:49:22.652 --> 00:49:24.076
Which dialogue did you say before?

00:49:26.202 --> 00:49:27.938
I said,

00:49:28.641 --> 00:49:32.226
“I wanted to wake up and see that someone was waiting for me.”

00:49:33.573 --> 00:49:35.367
“Can you be that person for me?”

00:49:38.488 --> 00:49:43.160
I never knew you can be so drunk in love.

00:49:43.161 --> 00:49:45.308
Is that person still in your life?

00:49:54.384 --> 00:49:56.942
We’re apart for a while.

00:49:58.862 --> 00:50:03.152
But I hope one day, we will find each other again.

00:50:07.234 --> 00:50:09.528
So he isn’t dating the female lead?

00:50:09.528 --> 00:50:11.526
Who’s that lucky person then?

00:50:43.342 --> 00:50:44.931
Lay!

00:50:44.931 --> 00:50:46.519
Finished what you needed to do?

00:50:47.288 --> 00:50:48.403
Is Puen still in there?

00:50:48.403 --> 00:50:49.628
Hold on.

00:50:49.628 --> 00:50:52.010
He left right after the interview was over.

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:54.102
I was in line to get the souvenir.

00:50:54.102 --> 00:50:54.675
This.

00:50:54.675 --> 00:50:55.995
I got one for you too.

00:50:55.995 --> 00:50:58.141
Cute, right?

00:50:59.227 --> 00:51:00.564
So cute.

00:51:03.379 --> 00:51:04.643
So cute.

00:51:43.209 --> 00:51:45.062
We also have one in this universe?

00:51:50.988 --> 00:51:52.107
Excuse me.

00:51:52.107 --> 00:51:53.569
I’m sorry.

00:51:53.569 --> 00:51:54.840
We’re close.

00:51:56.825 --> 00:52:02.671
Can I please take a look inside?

00:52:03.340 --> 00:52:04.665
I’ll be just a second.

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:10.876
Fine.

00:52:11.023 --> 00:52:14.044
I’ll clean up the storefront in the meantime.

00:52:14.044 --> 00:52:15.004
Thank you

00:53:08.116 --> 00:53:09.723
Everything is the same.

00:53:22.385 --> 00:53:23.612
I’m done.

00:53:23.612 --> 00:53:24.825
I’ll be leaving…

00:53:38.353 --> 00:53:39.384
Talay.

00:53:45.505 --> 00:53:46.830
Sorry, Tess.

00:53:48.761 --> 00:53:50.761
If you were Talay, you would have called me.

00:53:53.105 --> 00:53:54.988
I got a bit lost around here.

00:53:56.907 --> 00:54:00.669
Didn’t think there was this place in this universe.

00:54:09.528 --> 00:54:10.677
Bye, now.

00:54:11.587 --> 00:54:12.530
Dang.

00:54:32.381 --> 00:54:38.803
Do you know what the first thing I'll say to you is if we meet in our universe?

00:54:38.803 --> 00:54:39.657
What?

00:54:39.657 --> 00:54:45.778
Dang!

00:54:51.712 --> 00:54:53.360
When did you come back?

00:54:56.163 --> 00:54:57.483
Days ago.

00:54:58.233 --> 00:55:00.644
I just couldn’t get to you.

00:55:01.889 --> 00:55:05.562
Because of your fame, I just…

00:55:30.149 --> 00:55:31.356
I’m sorry.

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:35.170
You must be very tired.

00:55:39.649 --> 00:55:42.723
From now on, things will be okay.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:08.706
I told you, ‘To be my wife, you must endure.’

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.888
Your wife, my ass!

00:56:27.724 --> 00:56:28.855
You know what?

00:56:29.724 --> 00:56:32.648
I dreamt about the secret island.

00:56:33.324 --> 00:56:34.796
I tried to get there.

00:56:35.901 --> 00:56:37.255
But it was flooded.

00:56:37.501 --> 00:56:38.914
I waited a whole month.

00:56:39.597 --> 00:56:47.469
Do you know how long those 43,200 minutes I waited for you felt like?

00:56:50.617 --> 00:56:52.617
It was not different for me.

00:56:53.790 --> 00:57:00.898
Because for me, it was 2,592,000 seconds I waited for you.

00:57:02.857 --> 00:57:04.857
We share the same brain cells.

00:57:05.588 --> 00:57:07.588
We literally measure every bit of time.

00:57:09.724 --> 00:57:10.815
But damn.

00:57:12.224 --> 00:57:13.280
I’m so happy.

00:57:14.694 --> 00:57:19.600
Now that I’m with you seeing your real face,

00:57:21.966 --> 00:57:23.349
it feels like a dream.

00:57:48.683 --> 00:57:51.300
Does it still feel like a dream?

00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.803
Or do you want me to do more?

00:57:57.468 --> 00:57:59.204
What are you saying, Puen?

00:58:04.353 --> 00:58:05.648
I’m kidding.

00:58:14.248 --> 00:58:21.122
Promise me you won’t leave me again.

00:58:31.451 --> 00:58:33.723
I don’t want you to disappear on me again.

00:58:54.493 --> 00:58:55.994
I will not leave you again.

00:58:58.519 --> 00:58:59.704
I promise.

01:00:34.352 --> 01:00:36.058
I miss the time when we’re in the other universe.

01:00:38.697 --> 01:00:42.106
Should we do something to reminisce about it?

01:01:14.179 --> 01:01:15.843
I miss that universe too.

01:01:16.367 --> 01:01:20.003
Do you remember we ate this noodle when we were there?

01:01:20.701 --> 01:01:22.261
Of course, I do.

01:01:24.856 --> 01:01:26.856
We have one here as well.

01:01:27.389 --> 01:01:28.352
Hey!

01:01:29.057 --> 01:01:30.094
That’s right.

01:01:35.722 --> 01:01:36.693
Take this.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:37.722
Hold it.

01:01:50.406 --> 01:01:52.142
You just stopped talking to me.

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:53.475
Good, isn’t it?

01:01:54.485 --> 01:01:56.485
Oh, yes. It’s so good.

01:01:56.766 --> 01:01:58.766
Besides, they taste just the same.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:01.483
Can we switch?

01:02:06.388 --> 01:02:08.124
Do you want some garlands?

01:02:09.723 --> 01:02:10.989
No.

01:02:11.167 --> 01:02:12.563
I’m not worshiping Buddha today.

01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:15.036
Hey.

01:02:15.506 --> 01:02:16.434
I’ll take one.

01:02:26.351 --> 01:02:27.969
What are you eating?

01:02:28.884 --> 01:02:30.884
It looks yummy.

01:02:32.981 --> 01:02:33.862
Here.

01:02:36.963 --> 01:02:38.082
Go on.

01:02:41.750 --> 01:02:43.104
Thank you.

01:02:53.226 --> 01:02:54.551
What are you eating?

01:02:55.065 --> 01:02:56.008
It looks yummy.

01:03:00.283 --> 01:03:01.634
What is it now?

01:03:02.642 --> 01:03:03.523
Here.

01:03:03.963 --> 01:03:05.603
Eat these flowers for now.

01:03:24.642 --> 01:03:25.673
Are you sulking?

01:03:31.204 --> 01:03:32.382
Here.

01:03:33.045 --> 01:03:34.898
Come on. Eat it.

01:03:42.527 --> 01:03:46.406
Will you open your mouth or I make you do it?

01:03:49.178 --> 01:03:50.591
Are you mimicking me?

01:04:07.893 --> 01:04:08.865
There.

01:04:27.527 --> 01:04:28.881
If you're going to stare at me like that,

01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:30.707
you might as well eat me.

01:04:32.157 --> 01:04:33.483
Can I?

01:04:35.735 --> 01:04:36.573
You’re crazy.

01:04:44.441 --> 01:04:46.307
Eat it. Do it.

01:04:46.647 --> 01:04:47.708
Take it all.

01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.139
Thank you for coming back and searching for me.

01:04:54.139 --> 01:04:58.603
And thank you for taking away my fear of tomorrow.

01:04:58.603 --> 01:05:01.611
But you know what this showbiz is like, Puen.

01:05:01.611 --> 01:05:03.507
I miss our time together.

01:05:03.507 --> 01:05:05.521
Can we just go back?

01:05:05.521 --> 01:05:07.431
Are we back to this universe again, Tess?

01:05:08.521 --> 01:05:10.521
I want to stop time.

01:05:11.204 --> 01:05:13.563
I want to stop our universal traveling.

01:05:13.563 --> 01:05:16.790
We finally get to see the same moon.
