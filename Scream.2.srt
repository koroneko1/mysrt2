1
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:32,534
I hate scary movies. I should be studying.
You know I got a bio due.

2
00:00:32,617 --> 00:00:34,827
Baby, did I mention
that these tickets were free?

3
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,248
- Free.
- Sandra Bullock is playing down the street.

4
00:00:38,331 --> 00:00:41,376
Nobody wanna pay 7.50
to see some Sandra Bullock shit.

5
00:00:41,459 --> 00:00:43,336
Unless she's naked.

6
00:00:43,419 --> 00:00:46,756
But you will sit through
a movie called <i>Stab</i>?

7
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,758
It's adrenaline, Maureen.

8
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,761
It's good to be scared. It's primal.
You know what I'm sayin'?

9
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:53,888
- No, I'm gonna tell you what it is, okay?
- What?

10
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:57,559
It's a dumb-ass white movie
about some dumb-ass white girls...

11
00:00:57,642 --> 00:01:00,770
gettin' their white asses
cut the fuck up, okay?

12
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,439
Yeah. I suppose Sandra Bullock
is Miss Ethnicity, right?

13
00:01:03,523 --> 00:01:06,693
No. All I'm saying is that
the horror genre is historical...

14
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:08,695
for excluding the African-American element.

15
00:01:08,778 --> 00:01:11,948
When the hell you get your PhD
in black cinema, Sister Souljah?

16
00:01:12,031 --> 00:01:16,369
Listen. I read my <i>Entertainment Weekly,</i> okay?
I know my shit.

17
00:01:16,452 --> 00:01:18,913
Yeah, Maureen.
I read my <i>Black Beat</i> too, homey.

18
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:20,996
Tonight we're gonna
have an all-black movie,

19
00:01:21,021 --> 00:01:23,108
all-black cast,
all-black wardrobe, black eyes—

20
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:25,670
Everything. Black-eyed peas. Black cats—

21
00:01:26,838 --> 00:01:28,298
- Crazy girl.
- Thank you.

22
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:30,550
- Hi. Here you go.
- What's this?

23
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:32,552
<i>Stab</i> souvenirs. The studio sent them.

24
00:01:33,553 --> 00:01:35,555
And it's white.

25
00:01:35,638 --> 00:01:36,973
Thanks.

26
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,058
Thank you.

27
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,694
Kill! Kill! Kill!

28
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:52,071
Very romantic.

29
00:02:52,256 --> 00:02:55,093
- Yeah.
- All right. She doesn't stand a chance.

30
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:06,854
Take it off!

31
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:08,439
Yeah!

32
00:03:11,442 --> 00:03:13,569
Why has she gotta be naked?

33
00:03:13,653 --> 00:03:16,823
What does that have to do with the plot
of the story, her being butt-ass naked?

34
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:19,242
I don't know about the plot,
but I got a stiff one.

35
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:21,619
You better loosen up that wrist.

36
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,183
Hello?

37
00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,476
<i>Hello?</i>

38
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:48,771
- Who is this?
<i>- Guess.</i>

39
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:53,609
- No, really. Who is this?
<i>- Were you expecting somebody?</i>

40
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,488
No.

41
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:00,867
Bitch, hang the phone up
and star-69 his ass! Damn!

42
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:04,620
- Who is this?
<i>- Who would you like it to be?</i>

43
00:04:04,704 --> 00:04:07,039
I don't like games. Who is this?

44
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:12,295
<i>Look out back.</i>

45
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:14,964
<i>Do you see your boyfriend anywhere?</i>

46
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:19,093
I don't even have a boyfriend right now.

47
00:04:19,177 --> 00:04:21,262
<i>Would you like one?</i>

48
00:04:21,971 --> 00:04:25,224
Damn it all. Give me some money.
I need to get some popcorn.

49
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:29,562
- You got money.
- I got <i>my</i> money. I asked for <i>your</i> money.

50
00:04:30,146 --> 00:04:31,981
<i>What do you say?</i>

51
00:04:32,064 --> 00:04:33,483
Cheap-ass.

52
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,652
- Thank you.
<i>- Come on.</i>

53
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,989
<i>Cat got your tongue?</i>

54
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:43,367
I don't even know you,
and I dislike you already.

55
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:57,173
Come on! We're missing it!
We're missing it!

56
00:04:58,257 --> 00:05:00,218
- Hey, we're sold out.
- Cool!

57
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:05,556
Hello.

58
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,891
Hi.

59
00:05:07,433 --> 00:05:10,728
Can I have a medium popcorn,
no butter and a small Diet Pepsi?

60
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,647
- You got it.
- Thanks.

61
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,732
That's it. I am not going back in there.

62
00:05:14,816 --> 00:05:17,068
Come on, you chickenshit. It's just a movie.

63
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:19,237
No, it's not just a movie. It's a true story.

64
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,531
All these kids got killed
a couple years ago in California.

65
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,158
- Here's the popcorn.
- Thanks.

66
00:05:24,242 --> 00:05:27,578
God. I was so scared,
I almost had a heart attack.

67
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:30,748
Stab you, man!

68
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,683
- You ass!
- I'm sorry. I had to, baby.

69
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:51,769
- Why are you playing?
- Would you relax?

70
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,565
- God. What's wrong with you?
- I don't like being scared.

71
00:05:55,648 --> 00:05:58,734
- I don't like that.
- Baby, it's just a movie.

72
00:05:59,485 --> 00:06:02,154
Besides, scary movies are great foreplay.

73
00:06:02,655 --> 00:06:04,448
Excuse me?

74
00:06:06,117 --> 00:06:08,536
- Let's go see Sandra Bullock.
- No, no.

75
00:06:09,245 --> 00:06:11,622
Sandra started already. We can stay.

76
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:14,292
Just stop playin' so much.

77
00:06:17,545 --> 00:06:18,880
All right.

78
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:20,923
I gotta go to the bathroom.

79
00:06:22,508 --> 00:06:24,135
See ya inside.

80
00:06:40,776 --> 00:06:42,528
Come on!

81
00:06:53,497 --> 00:06:54,999
Die! Die! Die!

82
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,121
Sorry.

83
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,876
Hello?

84
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:49,720
No. I didn't mean it. I didn't mean it.

85
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:53,474
I swear. I swear. I'll be good.

86
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:55,726
Please, don't, Mommy. No.

87
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,312
I'll be good.

88
00:07:59,063 --> 00:08:01,482
You want to know why?
Why I did it, Mommy?

89
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,901
I'll tell you. Really.
I'll tell you, Mommy.

90
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:06,946
Really. I'll tell you
why I did it, Mommy.

91
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:09,573
Listen, Mommy. Listen, Mommy.

92
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:55,619
No! No, no, no!
Don't do that!

93
00:09:02,001 --> 00:09:04,712
Move! Move! Go!

94
00:09:04,795 --> 00:09:06,505
Run. Go!

95
00:09:11,927 --> 00:09:14,096
Baby, give it up.

96
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,685
You came back just in time.
It looks like she's about to get it.

97
00:09:19,769 --> 00:09:21,729
Want some popcorn?

98
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,818
See, if that was me,
I would be out of there.

99
00:09:36,077 --> 00:09:37,828
Here it comes!

100
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:40,206
Here it comes!

101
00:09:41,207 --> 00:09:42,833
Here it comes, baby!

102
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,282
Kill her!

103
00:11:09,253 --> 00:11:11,714
- Yeah!
- Nice goin'!

104
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:18,929
Hey. What are you doing?

105
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,158
Hello?

106
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,247
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Sidney.</i>

107
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:30,084
- Yes?
<i>- What's your favorite scary movie?</i>

108
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,504
- Who is this?
<i>- You tell me.</i>

109
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,219
Cory Gillis, 555-01 76.

110
00:12:40,302 --> 00:12:42,596
<i>- Oh, shit!</i>
- Hot flash, Cory.

111
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:44,682
<i>- Shit!</i>
- Prank calls are a criminal offense...

112
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,017
prosecuted under penal code 653-M.

113
00:12:49,061 --> 00:12:51,021
Hope you enjoyed the movie.

114
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:53,190
Time to change numbers again?

115
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:56,735
No. It'll die off.
It's opening weekend. We'll see how it goes.

116
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:58,946
Okay.

117
00:13:01,782 --> 00:13:04,785
<i>You know, Ron, it's not an easy thing...</i>

118
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:09,290
<i>to be accused of a crime you didn't commit,
particularly one as heinous as murder.</i>

119
00:13:09,373 --> 00:13:12,459
<i>But how do people treat you now that
they know the truth about your innocence?</i>

120
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:16,588
<i>Most people are cool. There's some 
who still keep a safe distance...</i>

121
00:13:16,672 --> 00:13:19,466
<i>which is odd for me, 'cause I've always been
sort of a people person.</i>

122
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,469
<i>But you were wrongly accused.
You were fully exonerated.</i>

123
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:26,223
<i>Yeah. That and a nickel will get you a cup
of coffee. Even that's not true anymore.</i>

124
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,810
<i>Certainly, with Gale Weathers's book,
and now the movie...</i>

125
00:13:29,893 --> 00:13:32,313
<i>it's set the record straight
for Cotton Weary.</i>

126
00:13:32,396 --> 00:13:35,274
<i>One would think. But Gale's been terrific
throughout this whole thing.</i>

127
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,068
Hey. Move your ass, okay? You're late.

128
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:41,155
Don't forget about that martini mixer
tonight at the Delta Lambda Zetas.

129
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:44,575
I don't think I'm gonna
be able to make it, Hal.

130
00:13:44,658 --> 00:13:45,659
What?

131
00:13:45,743 --> 00:13:48,746
Don't even try to bag, okay?
'Cause you promised me.

132
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:52,041
- A vague promise at best.
- Nobody's asking you to join, okay?

133
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,043
It's a party. Free beer, meet the girls.

134
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:56,045
Hallie, you know me and organized religion.

135
00:13:56,128 --> 00:13:58,380
- It's a sorority.
- Worse.

136
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:01,967
Look, Sid. Just lower the walls
for the next few days, okay?

137
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:05,304
This self-induced isolation
you got goin' is not healthy.

138
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:07,848
- I'm fine.
- “I'm fine.”

139
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:11,268
Yes, I know. “I'm fine”
is stretched tightly across your face.

140
00:14:11,352 --> 00:14:12,770
Like that.

141
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,772
Check out the news.

142
00:14:19,068 --> 00:14:22,321
<i>The two Windsor College students
were murdered last night...</i>

143
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:24,948
<i>during a sneak preview of the new movie</i> Stab.

144
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:28,619
<i>The police haven't released any information
except for the victims' names...</i>

145
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:31,622
<i>but a press conference
is scheduled for later today.</i>

146
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:34,625
<i>The victims,
Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens...</i>

147
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,668
<i>were both Windsor seniors.</i>

148
00:14:36,752 --> 00:14:39,505
- Where's Randy?
- He's got Film Theory this morning.

149
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:42,341
<i>... ended with the brutal murders
of two promising young—</i>

150
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,436
- Sidney! Sidney!
- Sidney.

151
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,146
Sidney, did you know the victims?

152
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,898
- Do you feel threatened by the murders?
- No comment.

153
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,566
- Do you think there'll be more murders?
- Sidney.

154
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,693
- What can you tell us about the victims?
- How about the police?

155
00:15:01,777 --> 00:15:03,904
- We just need one statement.
- Please talk to us.

156
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,659
You could say what happened in that theater
is a direct result of the movie itself.

157
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:12,830
That is so Moral Majority. You can't blame
real-life violence on entertainment.

158
00:15:12,913 --> 00:15:15,916
What? Wait a second. Yes, you can.
Don't you even watch the news?

159
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,836
Yeah. Hello! The murderer
was wearing a ghost mask, okay?

160
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,213
Just like in the movie.
It's directly responsible.

161
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:24,383
No, it's not. Movies are not
responsible for our actions.

162
00:15:24,466 --> 00:15:27,594
It's a classic case of life
imitating art imitating life.

163
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:30,597
This is not a hypothetical.
It's not about art.

164
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:33,267
I had Biology with that girl.
This is reality.

165
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,018
Thank you. I agree with you.

166
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,104
Let me tell you about reality, Mickey.

167
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:39,231
I lived through this. Okay?

168
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,316
Life is life. It doesn't imitate anything.

169
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,610
Come on, Randy. With all due respect...

170
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,800
the killer obviously
patterned himself after two

171
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,972
serial killers who have
been immortalized on film.

172
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:49,575
- Thank you.
- Right.

173
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,077
Are you suggesting that someone's
trying to make a real-life sequel?

174
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:55,038
<i>Stab 2?</i>
Who'd want to do that? Sequels suck.

175
00:15:55,998 --> 00:15:58,125
- Come on, man.
- Please. Please.

176
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,085
By definition alone, they're inferior films.

177
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:03,297
It's bullshit generalization.
Many sequels have surpassed their original.

178
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,673
- Oh, yeah?
- Name one.

179
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,799
Yeah.

180
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:09,428
<i>- Aliens.</i> Far better than the first.
- There's no accounting for taste.

181
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:11,638
Thank you. Ridley Scott rules.
Name another.

182
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:16,101
No<i>. Aliens</i> is a classic, okay?
“Get away from her, you bitch!”

183
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,854
I believe the line is “Stay away from her,
you bitch.” It's film class, right?

184
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,274
- He got you.
- You know what I mean.

185
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,859
- Another.
<i>- T2.</i>

186
00:16:24,651 --> 00:16:27,404
- You've got a hard-on for Cameron.
- Big one.

187
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,240
But wait a second.
The first <i>Terminator</i> is historical.

188
00:16:30,324 --> 00:16:31,408
Yeah.

189
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:32,826
“Sarah Connor?”

190
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:33,911
“Yes.”

191
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:38,790
All right. Okay.
<i>House II: The Second Story.</i>

192
00:16:38,874 --> 00:16:40,167
What?

193
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:43,337
The entire horror genre
was destroyed by sequels.

194
00:16:44,087 --> 00:16:46,798
I got it, by the way. I got it.

195
00:16:47,382 --> 00:16:48,967
<i>The Godfather: Part II.</i>

196
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:55,974
Very good.
That's the Oscar-winning exception.

197
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,145
All right. That's enough.
That'll be a wrap.

198
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:03,774
The sequel discussion to be continued.

199
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,401
Oh, no!

200
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:09,947
So, Mr. Originality,
how would you make it different?

201
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,741
I'd let the geek get the girl.

202
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:20,040
Three hundred people watched.
Nobody did anything.

203
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:22,209
They thought it was a publicity stunt,
for Christ sakes.

204
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:24,378
And it would have been a good one too.

205
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:26,547
- It's starting again, Randy.
- It's not.

206
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,841
A lot of shit happens at the movies.
People get robbed, shot, maimed, murdered.

207
00:17:29,925 --> 00:17:32,511
Multiplexes is a very dangerous place
to be these days.

208
00:17:32,594 --> 00:17:34,805
Yeah, and you are in extreme denial.

209
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:37,474
And you should be too.
This has nothing to do with us.

210
00:17:37,558 --> 00:17:40,051
Randy, a guy in a ghost
mask hacked up two people

211
00:17:40,076 --> 00:17:42,169
in a movie theater
telling our life story.

212
00:17:42,229 --> 00:17:45,816
- Coincidence?
- You know what happened at Woodsboro, Randy.

213
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:47,651
- You can't ignore it.
- I know, Sid...

214
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,570
but I don't want to
go back there again.

215
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:52,072
Can't we just go back to
our pseudo-quasi-happy existence?

216
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,782
- Hello, Derek. How ya doin'?
- Hey, Sid.

217
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,784
- Hey.
- I've been looking everywhere.

218
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,120
- I heard. You weren't in class.
- Yeah, I know.

219
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:00,497
I skipped. I couldn't take
all the “that's her” looks.

220
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,500
Is there anything I can do?

221
00:18:03,584 --> 00:18:07,629
You got any tricks for getting me back
to a pseudo-quasi-happy existence?

222
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:11,008
- You know, I might just have one for that.
- Yeah?

223
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,968
Oh, yeah? What is it?

224
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,139
Oh, Christ.

225
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:20,767
That was pretty good.

226
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,187
Get a room.

227
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,904
Hey, guys. Wait up.

228
00:18:34,615 --> 00:18:36,533
- They're threatening to what?
<i>- Pull the damn thing.</i>

229
00:18:36,617 --> 00:18:38,118
- Are you kidding me?
<i>- No!</i>

230
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,120
They'd be stupid to pull this movie.

231
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:42,748
With all this free press,
they're gonna have huge numbers this weekend.

232
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:44,958
<i>- You think so?</i>
- It'll break box office records.

233
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,752
<i>Remember, we need an exclusive.
Don't forget.</i>

234
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,795
- Consider it done.
<i>- Yeah, but I need—</i>

235
00:18:49,463 --> 00:18:52,799
Miss Weathers? Hi. I'm Joel. The affiliate
sent me. I'm your new cameraman.

236
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,801
Yeah. You got experience?

237
00:18:54,885 --> 00:18:57,346
Yeah. I'm local,
but I shot the bingo finals.

238
00:18:57,429 --> 00:18:59,306
- Great. Great.
- I almost got an award for that.

239
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,391
All right. Listen, Joel.
This is how it works.

240
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:03,185
I point, you shoot.

241
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,854
You stay focused and fast on your feet,
and we'll get along fine.

242
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,814
You're playing with the big boys now.
You got it?

243
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,775
Got it. Got you covered. I'm all over it.

244
00:19:09,858 --> 00:19:11,985
Hey, look. Don't worry about a thing.
How hard can it be?

245
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:13,654
You point, and I shoot. I'm there!

246
00:19:13,737 --> 00:19:15,864
Excuse me. Miss Weathers?
Could I have a minute?

247
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:17,449
- No.
- Just one second.

248
00:19:17,532 --> 00:19:19,596
I know you probably
get this all the time.

249
00:19:19,621 --> 00:19:22,019
I just wanted to say I am
a big fan of your work.

250
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:24,373
I just finished you book.
I couldn't put it down.

251
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:27,751
Insightful, probing—
I just really, really loved your book.

252
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:28,960
- Thank you.
- Sure.

253
00:19:29,044 --> 00:19:30,671
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

254
00:19:30,754 --> 00:19:34,716
I'm a writer myself. I just write for
the local paper. For the <i>Post Telegraph.</i>

255
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,551
I'm Debbie Salt.

256
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:39,429
I took your seminar in Chicago last year.

257
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:41,973
I was the one in the front row
asking all the questions.

258
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,518
- Right. I thought you looked familiar.
- Thank you.

259
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:49,523
Can't wait to see the movie. You must be
getting quite a lot of flak on that, right?

260
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,775
With all the violence-in-cinema issues.

261
00:19:51,858 --> 00:19:53,819
What is your position going to be?

262
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:55,445
- No comment.
- Miss Weathers, please—

263
00:19:55,529 --> 00:19:58,949
It would be such an honor for me
if I could get a quote from you for my story.

264
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:01,535
- Okay. Begin quote.
- Great.

265
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:04,538
“Your flattering remarks
are both desperate and obvious.”

266
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:06,081
- Ouch!
- End quote.

267
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,636
Gale, what are you doing here?
Do you think

268
00:20:07,661 --> 00:20:09,233
these murders are connected
to Sidney Prescott?

269
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:12,462
Miss Weathers, what's your theory on these
murders? What's your feeling about this?

270
00:20:12,546 --> 00:20:14,506
May I have your attention?

271
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:17,634
- My name is Chief Louis Hartley—
- Chief Hartley.

272
00:20:18,969 --> 00:20:21,430
Hi. Gale Weathers,
author of <i>The Woodsboro Murders.</i>

273
00:20:21,513 --> 00:20:23,598
Do you think the killer will strike again?

274
00:20:24,349 --> 00:20:27,018
We have no evidence
that this is a serial killer.

275
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,020
- I'd like to read from a prepared—
- Can you tell us of any...

276
00:20:29,104 --> 00:20:31,189
precautions that you're taking?

277
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:36,945
First of all, we think it's just
an isolated incident, and we will be—

278
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:38,321
Ladies.

279
00:20:38,405 --> 00:20:40,323
Oh, my God. This is huge.

280
00:20:40,407 --> 00:20:42,534
Do you have any suspects?

281
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:45,162
- Sidney, look. It's Gale Weathers.
- What?

282
00:20:45,245 --> 00:20:48,749
Star of the Gale Weathers press conference,
based on the book by Gale Weathers...

283
00:20:48,832 --> 00:20:52,377
soon to be a major motion picture
starring... Gale Weathers.

284
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,045
Be kind. She saved our lives.

285
00:20:54,629 --> 00:20:56,006
She had calf implants.

286
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:58,967
Chief Hartley, do you plan
on giving the town a curfew?

287
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,927
I'm gonna get closer.

288
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,557
- So that's her?
- Yeah.

289
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,853
And, of course,
we're questioning all the students—

290
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,813
Hello, girls. Enjoying yourselves?

291
00:21:11,897 --> 00:21:14,274
- Hello, Sister Lois, Sister Murphy.
- Hello, pledge.

292
00:21:14,357 --> 00:21:15,567
Hi, Sidney.

293
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,610
Hey.

294
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:20,906
This must be flat-out hell for you.
How are you holding up?

295
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,073
I manage.

296
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:26,036
It's really weird, isn't it?
To think this fuss is all because of you.

297
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:30,290
I mean, not directly, but in some
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon way.

298
00:21:30,373 --> 00:21:32,000
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

299
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:36,296
Now, Hallie, are you gonna bring your friend
to our little martini mixer tonight?

300
00:21:36,379 --> 00:21:38,590
- I have a lot of work to do.
- We'll be there.

301
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:42,093
Good. Because, Sid,
we have our eyes on you.

302
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:44,679
You hang in there,
and if there is anything we can do—

303
00:21:44,763 --> 00:21:48,099
The Delta Lambdas
are very sensitive to your plight.

304
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:50,393
- Yeah. Bye.
- Bye.

305
00:21:52,604 --> 00:21:54,934
You gonna start to dress
like that once you get in?

306
00:21:54,959 --> 00:21:56,233
That's not gonna happen.

307
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:59,319
The Delta Lambdas
are the biggest bunch of fuckin'—

308
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:03,073
Hey! I'm pledging Delta Lambda, thank you.

309
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,742
Oh, my God.

310
00:22:09,704 --> 00:22:11,206
Who's that?

311
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,126
Dewey?

312
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,753
Hey!

313
00:22:18,755 --> 00:22:20,590
What are you doing here?

314
00:22:22,801 --> 00:22:25,178
- I was worried about you.
- Yeah?

315
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:27,764
I heard about what happened,
and I was on the next plane.

316
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:31,101
- Can we talk?
- Yeah. Yeah.

317
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,104
Are you okay?

318
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:37,941
I'm fine, Dewey.
Or I was.

319
00:22:38,024 --> 00:22:41,278
I mean, things were okay until now.

320
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:44,906
But theater's going great.

321
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:48,159
I got my first starring role.
We open in two days.

322
00:22:48,243 --> 00:22:50,495
- That is great.
- Yeah. I'm loving it.

323
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,497
And I've got some great friends...

324
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:56,084
and... I'm seeing someone.

325
00:22:56,167 --> 00:23:00,213
Nice guy. Premed,
no apparent psychotic tendencies.

326
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:05,969
I was just worried.

327
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:07,137
Look, Sid.

328
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,224
If there is some freaked-out psycho trying
to follow in Billy Loomis's footsteps...

329
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:13,518
you probably already know him.

330
00:23:14,102 --> 00:23:15,478
Or her.

331
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:17,147
Or them.

332
00:23:17,689 --> 00:23:20,025
They're probably already in your life.

333
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:22,736
They get off on that.

334
00:23:23,737 --> 00:23:26,031
I just want you to be careful, Sid.

335
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:34,664
You think I don't know that, Dewey?

336
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:38,418
What am I supposed to do?

337
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:42,339
Just cut everybody off?
Crawl under a rock? What?

338
00:23:46,217 --> 00:23:48,178
Just watch out.

339
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:50,430
Keep an eye out.

340
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:53,475
I'm gonna talk to Chief Hartley
and the local police.

341
00:23:54,643 --> 00:23:56,645
I'm gonna just hang around.

342
00:23:57,187 --> 00:24:00,690
I wanna make sure you're safe,
if that's all right with you.

343
00:24:01,441 --> 00:24:03,610
Yeah. I'd be honored.

344
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:07,364
All right, Sid.

345
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:18,041
Hey.

346
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,044
Hey.

347
00:24:21,127 --> 00:24:23,046
- You okay?
- Uh-huh.

348
00:24:23,129 --> 00:24:25,048
- Who is that guy?
- An old friend.

349
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,425
Deputy Dewey, Woodsboro's finest.
What's he doing here?

350
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,428
He's worried.
Our surrogate big brother.

351
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:33,264
God. Nothing like a funeral
to bring the family together.

352
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:35,225
I'm gonna go say hi.

353
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:39,437
- Chief Hartley said the girl was stabbed 7—
- Drop it.

354
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,064
Hello, Sidney.

355
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,192
- How are you?
- Hi.

356
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:46,475
What do you want, Gale?

357
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,304
I was hoping I might
get a few words with you.

358
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:54,369
- Cotton.
- Hi, Sidney.

359
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:57,372
Here we are at Windsor College,
where Sidney Prescott...

360
00:24:57,455 --> 00:25:00,583
has just been reunited
with Cotton Weary for the first time...

361
00:25:00,667 --> 00:25:02,669
since she wrongly accused him
of murdering her mother.

362
00:25:02,752 --> 00:25:05,588
- What the hell are you doing?
- We want to know how you feel.

363
00:25:05,672 --> 00:25:08,299
Tell us everything that's happened,
looking back on the last two years.

364
00:25:08,383 --> 00:25:11,761
Sidney, I'd just like to say
that I forgive and forget.

365
00:25:11,845 --> 00:25:14,431
Just like you, I'd like to get back on
with my own life.

366
00:25:15,015 --> 00:25:17,600
- Do you have any comments?
- You bitch!

367
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:21,229
- Hey. Deep breaths. Lot of deep breaths.
- Sidney, share with us, please.

368
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,941
- I'll share with you!
- Okay, okay.

369
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:28,778
- Did you get that on film?
- Yes, I got that on film.

370
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,072
Sid? Wait, wait, wait.

371
00:25:31,156 --> 00:25:33,700
Where's she going, Gale? Sidney?

372
00:25:33,783 --> 00:25:35,368
Where's she going?

373
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,662
Gale, I thought we had an official interview.

374
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,123
What's going on? She didn't know?

375
00:25:40,206 --> 00:25:41,958
Man, that was cold.

376
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:46,254
You need to check your conscience at the
door, sweetie. We're not here to be loved.

377
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,632
Gale, you promised me
10 minutes of national coverage.

378
00:25:49,716 --> 00:25:52,761
You'll get your 10 minutes
when I get my goddamn interview.

379
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,513
Don't walk away from me, Gale. I'm still—

380
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,349
Gale, I did my part.

381
00:25:58,433 --> 00:25:59,934
Joel!

382
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:06,900
Dewey.

383
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:09,944
What are you doing here?

384
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:12,155
Why don't you just leave her alone?

385
00:26:12,238 --> 00:26:14,365
Hasn't she been through enough?

386
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:16,409
And my name is Dwight.

387
00:26:17,994 --> 00:26:20,663
I was just doing my job, Dwight.

388
00:26:21,915 --> 00:26:24,042
No matter who gets hurt in the process?

389
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,085
Hey.

390
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:27,337
Who got punched here— again?

391
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:30,924
I don't condone violence,
but maybe you deserved it.

392
00:26:31,466 --> 00:26:33,134
Page 32:

393
00:26:33,218 --> 00:26:38,014
“Deputy Dewey filled the room
with his Barney Fife-ish presence.”

394
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:41,893
- You read my book.
- Yes. I do read, Miss Weathers.

395
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:45,438
Dewey, don't take it so seriously.
It's a character in a book.

396
00:26:45,522 --> 00:26:48,024
Page 41:

397
00:26:48,775 --> 00:26:52,278
“Deputy Dewey oozed with inexperience.”

398
00:26:54,989 --> 00:26:57,117
Don't you think you're overreacting
just a little bit?

399
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,203
No. What I think is that
you're a money-hungry,

400
00:27:00,228 --> 00:27:02,855
fame-seeking and,
forgive me for saying...

401
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:04,457
mediocre writer...

402
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,377
who's got a cold storage shed
where her heart should be.

403
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,295
No offense intended.

404
00:27:09,379 --> 00:27:11,256
Dewey, I never meant to imply—

405
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,424
How do you know that
my dimwitted inexperience...

406
00:27:13,508 --> 00:27:17,470
isn't merely a subtle form of manipulation
used to lower people's expectations...

407
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:22,016
thereby enhancing my ability to effectively
maneuver within any given situation?

408
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,819
I'm sorry.

409
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:38,158
I don't know what else to say...

410
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:41,411
except... I'm sorry.

411
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:45,415
No. I'm the one that's sorry.

412
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,084
I misjudged you.

413
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:49,919
Now, if you'll excuse me...

414
00:27:50,003 --> 00:27:52,130
I have some oozing to do.

415
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,217
One more thing.

416
00:27:56,885 --> 00:27:58,761
Nice streaks.

417
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:02,974
Well.

418
00:28:14,777 --> 00:28:16,696
Hey, I am not a sorority pusher.

419
00:28:16,779 --> 00:28:18,698
I just think, despite its trivialities...

420
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:23,161
it is a life-affirming, mentally stable,
healthy environment for you.

421
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:26,164
I mean, look at this friggin' place.

422
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:29,125
I think you're taking your psych major
a little too seriously, Hallie.

423
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:31,377
I'm fine.

424
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,963
Yeah? That's beginning
to become your theme song.

425
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:37,634
“I'm fine.” Yeah— “Fucked-up,
insecure, neurotic and emotional.”

426
00:28:37,717 --> 00:28:39,636
Sidney, you made it!

427
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,095
Hi!

428
00:28:41,179 --> 00:28:42,889
No, I really mean that.

429
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,682
- Hi.
- Hi.

430
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:46,768
Do you girls want a drink?

431
00:28:47,602 --> 00:28:50,605
Actually, yeah, but you know what?
We'll get it ourselves.

432
00:29:01,491 --> 00:29:03,576
<i>I love those guys. Are they still together?</i>

433
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:05,453
<i>I haven't seen it in, like, three weeks.</i>

434
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,330
- No, they broke up again.
<i>- Really?</i>

435
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:09,332
Sarah found out
that Bailey slept with Gwen.

436
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:11,376
She dumped him, like, two episodes ago.

437
00:29:11,459 --> 00:29:13,127
<i>I wish she'd get her shit together.</i>

438
00:29:13,211 --> 00:29:15,171
Hold on. Someone's calling.

439
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:18,424
Omega Beta Zeta.

440
00:29:18,508 --> 00:29:20,009
<i>Hello?</i>

441
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,512
- Yes?
<i>- Who is this?</i>

442
00:29:23,179 --> 00:29:26,099
- Cici. Who's this?
<i>- Who do you think?</i>

443
00:29:26,182 --> 00:29:27,684
Ted?

444
00:29:28,351 --> 00:29:31,104
Where are you?
Are you drinking? Hold on.

445
00:29:32,647 --> 00:29:35,191
Ted's on the other line.
He sounds drunk. I'll call you back?

446
00:29:35,275 --> 00:29:37,360
<i>That shit only calls you when he's drunk.</i>

447
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,697
<i>- Don't go over there, Cici.</i>
- All right. I'll call you back.

448
00:29:43,741 --> 00:29:46,286
Okay, Ted.
You sound loaded. What's up?

449
00:29:46,369 --> 00:29:47,870
<i>Who's Ted?</i>

450
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,915
I'm sorry. My bad.

451
00:29:50,999 --> 00:29:54,043
- I thought you were someone else.
<i>- That's okay. I am.</i>

452
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:57,130
Who are you calling for? Nobody's here.

453
00:29:57,714 --> 00:29:59,424
<i>Where is everybody?</i>

454
00:29:59,507 --> 00:30:02,760
We're cosponsoring the acid rain mixer
at Phi Gamma Alpha tonight.

455
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:05,471
<i>- Why aren't you there?</i>
- I'm “sober sister.”

456
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:08,141
I need to be here in case
a drunk sister calls and needs a ride.

457
00:30:08,224 --> 00:30:09,726
<i>That's too bad.</i>

458
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,853
“Drink with your brain.” That's our motto.

459
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:16,065
- Who are you calling for?
<i>- What if I said you?</i>

460
00:30:16,899 --> 00:30:19,902
- What if I said good-bye?
<i>- Why would you want to do that?</i>

461
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,657
Why do you always answer
a question with a question?

462
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,492
<i>I'm inquisitive.</i>

463
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:30,413
Yeah, and I'm impatient. Look.
Do you want to leave a message for someone?

464
00:30:30,997 --> 00:30:34,250
<i>Do you want to die tonight, Cici?</i>

465
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,216
Omega Beta Zeta.

466
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,677
<i>So, was it Teddy?</i>

467
00:30:44,761 --> 00:30:47,680
No. It was some creep asshole
trying to scare me.

468
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:50,266
<i>That movie</i> Stab, <i>bringing out the crazies.</i>

469
00:30:52,435 --> 00:30:54,520
- Shit.
<i>- What is it?</i>

470
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:57,148
- I heard a noise.
<i>- Where?</i>

471
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:58,733
Upstairs.

472
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,486
Shit!

473
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:05,948
Hello?

474
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:07,533
<i>Kill, kill, kill.</i>

475
00:31:07,617 --> 00:31:09,077
- Hello?
<i>- Die, die, die.</i>

476
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,661
Stop it!

477
00:31:11,245 --> 00:31:13,664
<i>I can't believe you're alone in that house.</i>

478
00:31:13,748 --> 00:31:15,750
I don't think I'm alone.

479
00:31:17,126 --> 00:31:19,087
I'm out of here.

480
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:27,887
<i>You're breaking up. Where are you?</i>

481
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:30,139
- Outside.
<i>- Don't panic, Cici.</i>

482
00:31:30,848 --> 00:31:32,809
<i>- Call campus security.</i>
- Okay.

483
00:31:40,191 --> 00:31:41,692
<i>Campus security.</i>

484
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:44,612
- Hi. I'm calling from the Omega Beta—
<i>- Can't hear you. I'm sorry. Hello?</i>

485
00:31:45,196 --> 00:31:46,948
<i>Hello?</i>

486
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,575
- Can you hear me now?
<i>- Hello?</i>

487
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,577
Hello? Shit!

488
00:31:56,833 --> 00:31:58,793
<i>- Campus security.</i>
- Yes. I'm calling from—

489
00:31:58,876 --> 00:32:01,212
<i>I can't hear you. Hello?</i>

490
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:04,006
I'm calling from
the Omega Beta Zeta house.

491
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,008
Look. Someone's harassing me.

492
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,010
Hello? Shit!

493
00:32:08,094 --> 00:32:09,554
Hey!

494
00:32:10,096 --> 00:32:12,265
- Jesus, Dawnie. You scared me.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

495
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,267
Did anyone call for me?

496
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,478
- What are you doing here?
- I live here, remember?

497
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:20,565
I just thought you were going to the mixer.

498
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:23,484
Yeah, I am.
I had to change, so I'll be out of here now.

499
00:32:26,946 --> 00:32:28,448
Omega Beta Zeta.

500
00:32:28,531 --> 00:32:31,284
<i>- Is Cici there?</i>
- Who's calling?

501
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:32,743
<i>It's Ted.</i>

502
00:32:33,327 --> 00:32:35,246
It's your ill-conceived boyfriend.

503
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:39,459
I'll see you later.
Don't forget to set the alarm.

504
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,378
Bye.

505
00:32:48,843 --> 00:32:50,136
Hello, Ted.

506
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,555
<i>You wish it was Ted.</i>

507
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,765
<i>Don't forget to set the alarm.</i>

508
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:24,021
Hello?

509
00:35:02,727 --> 00:35:04,687
No! Please, no!

510
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:08,190
No!

511
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:28,461
Everyone thinks that sororities
are just about blow jobs, but it's not true.

512
00:35:28,544 --> 00:35:31,297
We only promote safe, condomed sex.

513
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,675
See, we're about love,
respect and responsibility.

514
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,345
Harmonica style is okay, right?

515
00:35:37,428 --> 00:35:38,929
- Yeah.
- Cocktail?

516
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:41,098
What took you so long?

517
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,517
And you know Derek is
a Delta Lambda big brother.

518
00:35:43,601 --> 00:35:45,561
And we like to keep it all in the family.

519
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,899
Wow. You girls have really
given me a lot to think about.

520
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,359
Thanks.

521
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,111
- Sorry I'm late.
- It's working. It's working.

522
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:57,448
- Hey, babe. You wanna dance?
- I'd love to—

523
00:35:57,531 --> 00:36:00,660
with that tall,
wide-shouldered fraternity boy.

524
00:36:00,743 --> 00:36:03,704
- Think you can go arrange that?
- That hurts.

525
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:05,289
Go play.

526
00:36:05,373 --> 00:36:08,459
<i>Empire Strikes Back.</i>
It was a better story, improved effects.

527
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,920
Not a sequel.
Part of a trilogy, completely planned.

528
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:12,922
Yeah, I like those little furry things.

529
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,548
Ewoks. They blow.

530
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:16,467
Hey.

531
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,344
- How ya doin'?
- Good.

532
00:36:18,427 --> 00:36:21,472
- Twits being nice to you?
- Painfully nice.

533
00:36:21,555 --> 00:36:24,767
I take it you will not be pledging
Delta Lambda Zeta.

534
00:36:25,434 --> 00:36:26,977
I think not.

535
00:36:27,061 --> 00:36:28,562
I'm crushed.

536
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,691
Hey, guys.
Something is up at Omega Beta Zeta.

537
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,734
- Police are everywhere.
- Hurry!

538
00:36:35,403 --> 00:36:37,405
You hear that? Let's go!

539
00:36:39,073 --> 00:36:40,991
Here. I'll drive. Let's go.

540
00:36:54,672 --> 00:36:57,550
- Way to break up the party.
- Shit! I should have brought my drink.

541
00:36:57,633 --> 00:36:59,969
- Jack, hurry up! Come on, man.
- Yeah, yeah.

542
00:37:06,517 --> 00:37:08,769
Death by blunt trauma,
and there's a double stabbing.

543
00:37:08,853 --> 00:37:11,522
So it's definitely not suicide.

544
00:37:11,605 --> 00:37:13,566
Okay. Thank you.

545
00:37:18,612 --> 00:37:20,698
Gale, hi.
You're just getting here. It's not good.

546
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,950
It's a single victim. Sorority girl.

547
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:26,287
I gotta go. I've got a deadline.

548
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,251
- Joel, let's go.
- In a minute.

549
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,129
It's happening again, isn't it?

550
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,548
You'd love that, wouldn't you?

551
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,346
Better hurry, Gale. Might get scooped.

552
00:37:47,641 --> 00:37:49,435
Move it, Joel.

553
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:50,895
Gale.

554
00:37:51,395 --> 00:37:54,273
I have to be honest with you.
I'm not cut out for this.

555
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:58,360
I was brought here to do an interview,
not <i>Faces of Death 14.</i>

556
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,529
Do not fuck with me.

557
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,920
Come on.
Get your jacket. Let's get you home.

558
00:38:17,004 --> 00:38:18,506
Yeah.

559
00:38:49,578 --> 00:38:51,372
You about ready?

560
00:38:57,878 --> 00:38:59,380
Almost.

561
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,010
Hello?

562
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:06,971
<i>Hello, Sidney.</i>

563
00:39:07,054 --> 00:39:08,597
<i>Remember me?</i>

564
00:39:09,348 --> 00:39:14,311
- What do you want?
<i>- I want you. It's showtime.</i>

565
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:17,064
Then why don't you show your face,
you fucking coward.

566
00:39:17,606 --> 00:39:19,358
My pleasure.

567
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:21,110
Derek!

568
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:25,573
Sid? Sid?

569
00:39:27,157 --> 00:39:27,783
Derek!

570
00:39:28,951 --> 00:39:30,119
Sid?

571
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,373
Sid!

572
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,640
- It's me. You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

573
00:39:51,724 --> 00:39:53,559
- You okay?
- Yeah.

574
00:39:53,642 --> 00:39:55,561
No, Derek! Don't!

575
00:39:55,644 --> 00:39:57,021
Sid!

576
00:39:57,646 --> 00:39:59,023
Dewey!

577
00:39:59,607 --> 00:40:01,609
The killer's in there. And Derek.

578
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,710
- You all right?
- He went that way.

579
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,962
Sidney, he's in here!

580
00:40:26,926 --> 00:40:28,552
Is everything okay?

581
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:35,184
He got me. He got me.

582
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:40,147
- Apply pressure to it.
- No, Jesus—

583
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:42,566
Come on. Hold it there.

584
00:40:45,319 --> 00:40:47,237
All right.
The police are on their way.

585
00:40:56,747 --> 00:40:58,874
Thanks for your cooperation.

586
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:01,126
Hallie, we'll be with you
in a few minutes, okay?

587
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,711
No problem.

588
00:41:03,629 --> 00:41:07,174
That's the easiest interrogation
of my crime-filled life.

589
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:10,844
I'm gonna go get a quick cup of coffee.
You want?

590
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:12,429
No.

591
00:41:13,347 --> 00:41:15,265
You want some, Sid?

592
00:41:18,811 --> 00:41:21,021
How you doin'? You all right?

593
00:41:21,105 --> 00:41:22,940
Not at all.

594
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:27,027
You know, I knew this was coming.

595
00:41:27,111 --> 00:41:31,448
- I knew this wasn't over.
- You are not alone, Sid.

596
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:34,201
Okay? We are all here for you.

597
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:36,370
All right? Whatever you need.

598
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,790
That poor girl.

599
00:41:39,873 --> 00:41:41,041
I know.

600
00:41:41,125 --> 00:41:43,210
It's crazy, but—

601
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:47,131
- Derek could've been killed, you know.
- But he wasn't.

602
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,008
He's fine.

603
00:41:49,091 --> 00:41:53,595
He just needs to realize
the '90s is no time to play hero.

604
00:41:54,138 --> 00:41:56,598
Why would anyone go back
in that house anyway?

605
00:42:01,103 --> 00:42:04,106
I went around to the back of the house
and ran into Sid there.

606
00:42:04,189 --> 00:42:07,276
That's when she told me the killer was
inside, so I went in to see.

607
00:42:08,235 --> 00:42:10,404
You're lucky there's no nerve damage.

608
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:12,656
You're gonna have to take it easy though.

609
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:17,161
- Then you went back inside the house.
- Yeah.

610
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:20,080
No struggle?
He just cut you and ran away?

611
00:42:20,164 --> 00:42:23,751
- You're lucky he didn't kill you.
- Yeah, it's awfully convenient.

612
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:26,670
Say what?

613
00:42:26,754 --> 00:42:28,005
Nothing.

614
00:42:28,589 --> 00:42:30,632
It's just a shame he got away so easily.

615
00:42:30,716 --> 00:42:33,343
It's just a shame you got there too late...

616
00:42:33,427 --> 00:42:35,512
right after he disappeared.

617
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:42,644
Yeah, it is.

618
00:43:02,664 --> 00:43:04,708
We got three victims.

619
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:07,669
Maureen Evans, Phil Stevens...

620
00:43:07,753 --> 00:43:10,547
and Cici Cooper.

621
00:43:11,131 --> 00:43:12,966
Is Cici the girl's real name?

622
00:43:13,717 --> 00:43:17,054
No. It's Casey. Casey Cooper.

623
00:43:19,598 --> 00:43:21,517
As in Casey Becker?

624
00:43:22,518 --> 00:43:24,103
Excuse me?

625
00:43:24,186 --> 00:43:26,438
She was a young victim in Woodsboro.

626
00:43:26,522 --> 00:43:30,943
As well as her boyfriend, Steven Orth.

627
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:32,611
As in Phil Stevens.

628
00:43:32,694 --> 00:43:36,532
Maureen Evans—
Maureen Prescott. That's Sidney's mother.

629
00:43:37,074 --> 00:43:39,535
Do you think someone's
trying to duplicate Woodsboro?

630
00:43:40,327 --> 00:43:41,995
It looks like it.

631
00:43:44,581 --> 00:43:46,875
I think you have a copycat
on your hands, Chief.

632
00:43:47,501 --> 00:43:48,877
Jesus Christ.

633
00:43:48,961 --> 00:43:51,421
What are you doing to keep Sidney safe?

634
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:54,216
I got my two best detectives guarding her.

635
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:58,220
Do these guys have to
follow you around everywhere?

636
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:01,306
We're attached at the hip.

637
00:44:01,390 --> 00:44:03,559
How am I ever gonna get you alone?

638
00:44:05,686 --> 00:44:07,646
To be honest, Derek...

639
00:44:07,729 --> 00:44:10,941
I think it would probably
be in your best interest to...

640
00:44:11,024 --> 00:44:13,485
stay as far away from me as possible.

641
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:20,200
I hope that was an off-the-cuff remark
that holds no subtext whatsoever.

642
00:44:20,284 --> 00:44:22,494
No, actually...

643
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:25,080
I mean it.

644
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:31,461
I mean, look at you. You already got hurt.

645
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:34,256
I don't want to see that happen again.

646
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:36,967
I'll take my chances.

647
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,219
Derek, I'm serious.

648
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:41,930
This is serious.

649
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:48,687
You are concerned
with my personal well-being...

650
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:54,401
and not with trusting me or anything, right?

651
00:44:58,739 --> 00:45:00,908
Like I said, I just don't
want to see you get hurt.

652
00:45:00,991 --> 00:45:03,619
And I don't want to see you get hurt.

653
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,330
Okay, Sid?

654
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:20,636
- Take care, Miss Weathers.
- All right.

655
00:45:23,931 --> 00:45:25,474
- Dewey.
- Chief.

656
00:45:27,226 --> 00:45:28,727
Hi.

657
00:45:29,228 --> 00:45:32,689
So I'm heading over to admissions
to do some legwork. You game?

658
00:45:32,773 --> 00:45:35,359
I'm not here to write a book, Miss Weathers.

659
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:37,361
I'm here to help Sid.

660
00:45:39,321 --> 00:45:41,198
I want to help her too.

661
00:45:42,199 --> 00:45:45,160
And help myself, of course.

662
00:45:46,662 --> 00:45:48,372
Come on, Dewey.

663
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:51,458
Smile just once. Please?

664
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:55,170
I'll smile when I catch the killer.

665
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,676
Gale, hi.
So who do you think did it?

666
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:03,095
What about Sidney's father?
Has he been ruled out as a suspect?

667
00:46:03,178 --> 00:46:05,180
He's supposedly
out of the country on business...

668
00:46:05,264 --> 00:46:07,182
but that sounds a little fishy,
don't you think?

669
00:46:07,266 --> 00:46:10,269
- I'm not here to do your job, Miss Salt.
- What about this ex-cop, Dewey Riley?

670
00:46:10,352 --> 00:46:12,813
- It's kind of strange that he showed up.
- Yeah, what's he doing here?

671
00:46:12,896 --> 00:46:14,898
Dewey's a good guy...

672
00:46:14,982 --> 00:46:16,650
unlike some of us.

673
00:46:18,193 --> 00:46:19,861
Really?

674
00:46:20,737 --> 00:46:24,241
It just seems to me that if the killer
is repeating what happened in Woodsboro...

675
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:27,160
it's quite possible
that the killer could be from Woodsboro.

676
00:46:27,244 --> 00:46:28,870
That's all.

677
00:46:31,999 --> 00:46:35,252
Derek, you think Sid
will let me interview her for my documentary?

678
00:46:35,335 --> 00:46:39,798
Yeah. She turned down
<i>Primetime Live, 20/20</i> and <i>Dateline.</i>

679
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:42,426
- But for you, yeah.
- Drop it.

680
00:46:42,509 --> 00:46:44,928
I've been thinking about
this whole murder thing.

681
00:46:45,012 --> 00:46:47,180
- Have they checked out Randy?
- What?

682
00:46:47,264 --> 00:46:50,475
I know he's an innocent victim
the first time around, but he's a little off.

683
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:54,271
- You know what I'm saying?
- Come on. Randy? The guy's harmless.

684
00:46:54,354 --> 00:46:56,857
- That's what they said about Dahmer.
- Guys, keep it down.

685
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:58,984
Come on. What's up, Sid?

686
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:01,945
- Hey, Sid.
- How's it goin'?

687
00:47:02,029 --> 00:47:05,032
- Where's the Secret Service guys?
- Over there.

688
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:09,619
And which one is Kevin Costner?

689
00:47:09,703 --> 00:47:12,581
The one on the right is Officer Richards.

690
00:47:12,664 --> 00:47:15,792
He is a Capricorn. Divorced. Father of two.

691
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:20,422
And the one on the left is Officer Andrews.
He is a Gemini.

692
00:47:20,505 --> 00:47:22,758
He's single, but I think he's gay.

693
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:27,429
Derek? Penny for your thoughts.

694
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:33,935
“This morning, I woke up with this feeling...

695
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:37,564
I didn't know how to deal with.”

696
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:42,069
<i>And so I just decided to myself</i>

697
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:45,906
<i>- I'd hide it to myself</i>
- What is he doing?

698
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,368
Tom Cruise, <i>Top Gun,</i> 1986.

699
00:47:49,451 --> 00:47:52,037
- Derek, don't.
<i>- When you walked into the room</i>

700
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,414
<i>- I think I love you</i>
- Don't do this.

701
00:47:54,498 --> 00:47:58,668
<i>I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of?</i>

702
00:47:58,752 --> 00:48:01,630
<i>And though it worries me to say</i>

703
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:03,423
<i>I've never felt this way</i>

704
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:05,217
<i>Hey</i>

705
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,679
<i>I think I love you
So what am I so afraid of?</i>

706
00:48:09,763 --> 00:48:14,142
<i>I'm afraid that I'm not sure of
a love there is no cure for</i>

707
00:48:15,477 --> 00:48:18,814
<i>I think I love you
Isn't that what life is made of?</i>

708
00:48:18,897 --> 00:48:21,149
<i>And though it worries me to say</i>

709
00:48:21,858 --> 00:48:24,277
<i>I've never felt this way</i>

710
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:27,739
<i>Believe me
You don't have to worry</i>

711
00:48:27,823 --> 00:48:30,033
<i>I only wanna make you happy</i>

712
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:33,203
<i>And if you say “Hey, go away”
I will</i>

713
00:48:33,286 --> 00:48:35,163
<i>But I think better still</i>

714
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:36,957
<i>I better stick around and love you</i>

715
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:41,211
<i>Do you think I have a case?
Let me ask you to your face</i>

716
00:48:41,294 --> 00:48:47,843
<i>Do you really love me?
'Cause I think I love you</i>

717
00:48:57,018 --> 00:48:58,311
Come on.

718
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:03,733
Come on, people.
Let's show a little love, huh? Stand up.

719
00:49:04,901 --> 00:49:06,528
All right!

720
00:49:10,407 --> 00:49:12,367
Come here. Come here, come here.

721
00:49:14,953 --> 00:49:18,748
Don't worry, Sid.
I know things are a little crazy.

722
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,545
Isn't that a big frat faux pas?

723
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,589
Yeah. That is a big no-no.

724
00:49:25,672 --> 00:49:28,133
You're not supposed
to give your Greek letters to your girl...

725
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:29,926
no shape, way or form.

726
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,637
The brothers are gonna kick his ass,
but it's tradition.

727
00:49:32,721 --> 00:49:35,223
- It's tradition.
- It's good luck.

728
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,893
It'll protect you.

729
00:49:52,491 --> 00:49:55,577
<i>So, tell us about this part
you're getting rave reviews for.</i>

730
00:49:55,660 --> 00:49:58,121
<i>I play this young girl, Sidney Prescott...</i>

731
00:49:58,205 --> 00:50:01,666
<i>who discovers that her boyfriend
is this crazy serial killer...</i>

732
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:03,793
<i>who also killed her mother
the year before that.</i>

733
00:50:03,877 --> 00:50:05,740
<i>- What kind of research
did you do for the part?</i>

734
00:50:05,765 --> 00:50:06,487
<i>- I read the book.</i>

735
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:09,174
I don't get it.
They get Tori Spelling to play Sid...

736
00:50:09,257 --> 00:50:11,760
and they cast Joe Blow Nobody to play me.

737
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,513
At least you get David Schwimmer.

738
00:50:14,596 --> 00:50:18,141
I get the guy who drove Jane Seymour's
stagecoach for one episode of <i>Dr. Quinn.</i>

739
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:22,771
<i>Let's take a peek at the movie. This is
Tori Spelling starring in the new film</i> Stab.

740
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:31,321
<i>Billy, you scared me.</i>

741
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:34,491
<i>- What are you doing here?
- They let me go, Sid. I didn't do it.</i>

742
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:36,826
<i>- I'm innocent.
- I know.</i>

743
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:40,455
<i>- Please.
- Why won't you let me touch you?</i>

744
00:50:41,623 --> 00:50:46,169
Look. I've been going through
a lot lately, Billy. And with my mom—

745
00:50:46,253 --> 00:50:49,548
Sid, I think you need to
just deal with that and move on.

746
00:50:49,631 --> 00:50:52,842
I mean, when my mom left my dad,
I accepted it.

747
00:50:52,926 --> 00:50:56,513
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
Moms leave.

748
00:50:56,596 --> 00:51:01,226
Yeah, your mom left town.
She's not buried in a cemetery somewhere.

749
00:51:01,309 --> 00:51:03,603
My mom's dead,
and she's never coming back.

750
00:51:03,687 --> 00:51:05,188
Ever.

751
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:08,942
<i>Stupid.</i>

752
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,986
<i>I love scary movies.</i>

753
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:13,863
I'll wait for video.
Okay, let's get down to business.

754
00:51:13,947 --> 00:51:15,991
The way I see it,
someone's out to make a sequel.

755
00:51:16,074 --> 00:51:18,159
You know, cash in on all
the movie murder hoopla.

756
00:51:18,243 --> 00:51:21,037
So it's our job to observe
the rules of the sequel.

757
00:51:21,121 --> 00:51:23,707
Number one:
The body count is always bigger.

758
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:28,211
Number two: The death scenes are always
much more elaborate— more blood, more gore.

759
00:51:28,295 --> 00:51:31,214
Carnage candy.
Your core audience just expects it.

760
00:51:31,298 --> 00:51:35,302
And number three: If you want your sequel
to become a franchise, never ever—

761
00:51:35,385 --> 00:51:37,679
How do we find the killer, Randy?
That's what I wanna know.

762
00:51:38,513 --> 00:51:40,348
Let's look at the suspects.

763
00:51:40,432 --> 00:51:43,560
There's Derek, the obvious boyfriend.
Hello, Billy Loomis.

764
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:46,021
The guy's premed,
and his “pity me” surface wound...

765
00:51:46,104 --> 00:51:48,815
conveniently missed
every major vein and artery.

766
00:51:48,898 --> 00:51:52,235
- So you think it's Derek.
- Not so fast.

767
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,654
Let's assume the killer,
or 'ers, has a half a brain.

768
00:51:54,738 --> 00:51:56,990
He's not a <i>Nick at Nite</i> rerun type of guy.

769
00:51:57,073 --> 00:51:58,783
He wants to break some new ground.

770
00:51:58,867 --> 00:52:00,076
- Right?
- Right.

771
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,996
So forget the boyfriend. It's tired.
Who else do we got?

772
00:52:03,079 --> 00:52:06,666
- There's—
- Mickey, the freaky Tarantino film student.

773
00:52:09,169 --> 00:52:12,047
But if he's a suspect, so am I.
So let's move on.

774
00:52:13,048 --> 00:52:15,717
Let's not move on.
Maybe you are a suspect.

775
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:19,512
If I'm a suspect, you're a suspect.

776
00:52:21,473 --> 00:52:23,558
You have a point.

777
00:52:24,643 --> 00:52:27,187
Okay, let's move on to—

778
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:29,397
- Hallie.
- Sid's roommate?

779
00:52:30,440 --> 00:52:32,525
Serial killers are typically white males.

780
00:52:32,609 --> 00:52:36,237
That's why it's perfect. It's sort of 
against the rules, but not really.

781
00:52:36,321 --> 00:52:39,157
Mrs. Voorhees was a terrific serial killer.

782
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,992
And there's always room
for Candyman's daughter.

783
00:52:41,076 --> 00:52:44,412
She's sweet. She's deadly.
She's bad for your teeth.

784
00:52:47,874 --> 00:52:50,251
Come on, Randy.
These kids are your friends.

785
00:52:51,586 --> 00:52:54,297
- Who do you think's the killer?
- How about Gale Weathers?

786
00:52:54,381 --> 00:52:56,007
Gale? A killer?

787
00:52:56,091 --> 00:52:57,592
Why not?

788
00:52:59,135 --> 00:53:01,346
- She is vicious enough.
- She's an opportunist.

789
00:53:01,429 --> 00:53:02,597
Yeah.

790
00:53:02,681 --> 00:53:04,974
Isn't it conceivable
she's planning her next book?

791
00:53:05,058 --> 00:53:08,061
That's what reporters do, Dewey.
They stage the news.

792
00:53:08,687 --> 00:53:11,606
No. Gale's a lot of things,
but Gale's not a killer.

793
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,942
- Just because you're sweet on her—
- No, I'm not.

794
00:53:14,025 --> 00:53:16,528
Please! This is me talking. Randy...

795
00:53:16,611 --> 00:53:18,988
the unrequited love slave of Sidney Prescott.

796
00:53:19,072 --> 00:53:20,990
I know all about obsession.

797
00:53:22,242 --> 00:53:23,660
And pain.

798
00:53:23,743 --> 00:53:27,122
- You've got your love scar to prove it.
- And so do you.

799
00:53:27,205 --> 00:53:30,166
And what's with that limp anyway,
'cause you were stabbed in the back.

800
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,751
Severed nerve.

801
00:53:31,835 --> 00:53:33,795
Look. Gale's no killer.

802
00:53:34,796 --> 00:53:37,507
Okay, okay. Whatever you say.

803
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:40,802
But if she's not a killer, she's a target.

804
00:53:42,929 --> 00:53:44,973
Joel, let's get some establishing shots.

805
00:53:45,056 --> 00:53:47,016
Gale, can we talk for a sec?

806
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:49,477
- What is it?
- Look. I'm a little confused here.

807
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:51,479
I mean, with your given track record...

808
00:53:51,563 --> 00:53:53,815
why would you want to be here
when the killer strikes again?

809
00:53:53,898 --> 00:53:57,235
Granted, I should've read your book
before I took this job.

810
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,070
But I'm reading it now, and—

811
00:53:59,571 --> 00:54:01,489
I read what happened to your last cameraman.

812
00:54:01,573 --> 00:54:03,366
The guy got gutted.

813
00:54:03,450 --> 00:54:06,411
Now me, I'm gonna do what
any rational human being would do...

814
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:08,413
which is get the fuck out of here.

815
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:10,957
First of all, he wasn't gutted.
I made that up.

816
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:13,877
His throat was slashed.

817
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,921
Gale, gutted, slashed—
the guy ain't in the union no more.

818
00:54:17,005 --> 00:54:18,923
It's a job, Joel.

819
00:54:19,007 --> 00:54:21,259
And like every job, there's a few drawbacks.

820
00:54:21,342 --> 00:54:24,387
You're a professional cameraman.
You've got to act like one.

821
00:54:24,471 --> 00:54:27,390
Yeah, but I wanna report the news.
I don't wanna be the news.

822
00:54:27,474 --> 00:54:30,226
Besides, brothers don't last long
in situations like this.

823
00:54:30,310 --> 00:54:34,147
This is national television. Think about it.

824
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:36,149
This is a big chance for you.

825
00:54:36,232 --> 00:54:39,027
The story is monumental.
Don't you wanna be a part of that?

826
00:54:40,111 --> 00:54:41,863
Come on.

827
00:54:41,946 --> 00:54:45,408
I need you.
I cannot do this without you.

828
00:54:48,369 --> 00:54:50,288
Good. Come on.

829
00:54:50,371 --> 00:54:53,708
- Let's get some work done.
- Yeah, let's go get killed.

830
00:54:56,795 --> 00:55:00,840
We've been through this before. You know what
I think about your potential as an actress.

831
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:02,842
I know. I know.

832
00:55:02,926 --> 00:55:05,762
It's just that with the murders...

833
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:09,432
and the movie and my life—

834
00:55:09,516 --> 00:55:11,893
I do know how difficult it is for you.

835
00:55:13,978 --> 00:55:16,731
Gus, I don't think I can do it.

836
00:55:16,815 --> 00:55:20,610
The battle for the soul
is fought in the forum of art.

837
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:24,072
You're a fighter, Sid. That's why
you're here. That's why this is your major.

838
00:55:24,155 --> 00:55:26,449
- Yeah, I'm a fighter.
- I didn't hear that.

839
00:55:28,201 --> 00:55:30,537
- I'm a fighter.
- I don't believe you.

840
00:55:34,249 --> 00:55:35,583
I don't.

841
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,087
I'm a fighter.

842
00:55:40,171 --> 00:55:41,714
Okay.

843
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:47,387
So, at the risk of sounding like
a college drama teacher...

844
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:50,390
if you've got pain around
this kind of material, use it.

845
00:55:50,473 --> 00:55:52,600
This is your role, Sid.

846
00:55:53,184 --> 00:55:56,604
Cassandra is one of the great
tragic visionaries of literature.

847
00:55:57,564 --> 00:56:00,275
She saw it all coming: the wars...

848
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:02,068
the murder...

849
00:56:02,151 --> 00:56:03,444
the madness.

850
00:56:05,488 --> 00:56:07,532
She knew she was cursed.

851
00:56:08,783 --> 00:56:10,994
It was her fate, and she embraced it.

852
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,832
None of us can avoid our fate,
but as an artist...

853
00:56:15,915 --> 00:56:18,167
you can honestly face it...

854
00:56:19,085 --> 00:56:20,587
and fight it.

855
00:56:24,424 --> 00:56:27,427
- You're good.
- There's no understudy. I'm desperate.

856
00:56:31,723 --> 00:56:33,641
You can do this.

857
00:56:38,938 --> 00:56:42,150
Okay, everybody. Gather around.
Third Act, one last time.

858
00:56:42,233 --> 00:56:44,027
Cue the music.

859
00:56:57,498 --> 00:57:01,711
All behold the dreaded fate of Troy...

860
00:57:01,794 --> 00:57:06,841
that once stood proud
and light upon the hills of Sparta!

861
00:57:07,425 --> 00:57:11,512
Now shrouded in the deathly smoke of ruin...

862
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:15,683
her royal children pitched from her walls...

863
00:57:15,767 --> 00:57:20,521
her people driven through her ruins.

864
00:57:21,105 --> 00:57:25,944
And now alone in fate's cruel isolation...

865
00:57:26,027 --> 00:57:28,488
stands Cassandra...

866
00:57:28,571 --> 00:57:32,784
her kingdom, family and friends...

867
00:57:32,867 --> 00:57:35,036
driven to the wind.

868
00:57:38,456 --> 00:57:43,169
No crime against
gods or man have I committed...

869
00:57:43,962 --> 00:57:46,214
save to speak the truth.

870
00:57:47,298 --> 00:57:51,636
And each hideous vision born from my mind...

871
00:57:51,719 --> 00:57:53,680
has come to pass.

872
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:56,891
Troy has fallen...

873
00:57:57,725 --> 00:58:01,521
not by my hand or wish...

874
00:58:02,605 --> 00:58:04,607
but as I foresaw.

875
00:58:08,277 --> 00:58:12,407
So now, fate's vengeful eye...

876
00:58:13,116 --> 00:58:14,534
is fixed...

877
00:58:16,369 --> 00:58:17,537
on me.

878
00:58:19,914 --> 00:58:21,708
Tell us, O Cassandra...

879
00:58:21,791 --> 00:58:24,919
where has the sweetness of life gone?

880
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:28,464
What stays fate's hand
from striking now at thee?

881
00:58:29,382 --> 00:58:31,718
What stays fate's hand from thee?

882
00:58:31,801 --> 00:58:34,429
What stays fate's hand from thee?

883
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:36,431
What stays fate's hand from thee?

884
00:59:00,913 --> 00:59:02,623
All right. Hold it.

885
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,043
Hold it!

886
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:07,587
Everyone, take five.

887
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,979
Sidney?

888
00:59:38,034 --> 00:59:41,329
Sid. Your escort has arrived.

889
00:59:41,913 --> 00:59:44,499
- Derek, how long have you been here?
- I just got here.

890
00:59:44,582 --> 00:59:47,502
- Is everything okay? What's goin' on?
- What happened to Mickey?

891
00:59:47,585 --> 00:59:50,546
We swapped. He had to edit.
You get me instead. What happened?

892
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:52,131
Derek, don't.

893
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:58,721
Don't. I need to be alone
right now, okay?

894
01:00:01,557 --> 01:00:04,185
Being alone is not the answer, Sid.

895
01:00:05,436 --> 01:00:08,397
Yeah. Well, I think it is.

896
01:00:09,524 --> 01:00:11,234
I need some distance.

897
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:16,739
Do I get a say in this?

898
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:20,201
No.

899
01:00:26,082 --> 01:00:30,169
I guess I'm supposed to be... understanding.

900
01:00:31,462 --> 01:00:32,964
Yeah.

901
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,639
You got it.

902
01:00:50,648 --> 01:00:52,900
All right. Let's just assume the killer
is repeating Woodsboro—

903
01:00:54,235 --> 01:00:55,945
- Yes?
<i>- I have Bob calling.</i>

904
01:00:56,028 --> 01:00:59,365
- I'll have to call you back.
- That doesn't explain Sidney's attack.

905
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,076
Sidney wasn't killed in Woodsboro.

906
01:01:02,618 --> 01:01:04,704
It wasn't for a lack of trying.

907
01:01:04,787 --> 01:01:07,123
The killer's trying to finish
what was started.

908
01:01:07,206 --> 01:01:09,584
- Sid's under protection, right?
- Yeah.

909
01:01:10,585 --> 01:01:11,627
What?

910
01:01:11,711 --> 01:01:14,255
<i>- Bob really needs to talk to you.</i>
- Tell Bob I'll call him back.

911
01:01:14,338 --> 01:01:15,434
When'd she start smoking?

912
01:01:15,459 --> 01:01:17,782
Ever since those nude
pictures on the Internet.

913
01:01:17,842 --> 01:01:19,969
It was just my head.
It was Jennifer Aniston's body.

914
01:01:20,052 --> 01:01:22,096
Anyway, you're forgetting something.

915
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:24,765
In Woodsboro, there were more victims
before the homestretch:

916
01:01:25,266 --> 01:01:27,268
Tatum, my cameraman, Himbry—

917
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:31,397
Time-out. See, I don't need to be hearing
about no dead cameraman, all right?

918
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,942
I'm warning you guys. I am a verb away
from vacatin' these premises.

919
01:01:35,026 --> 01:01:37,320
I'm gonna go get me some coffee,
doughnuts, Prozac...

920
01:01:37,403 --> 01:01:40,698
see if I can find some crack, Special K,
X— not Malcolm—

921
01:01:40,781 --> 01:01:42,510
I'll be back when you
guys start talking about

922
01:01:42,535 --> 01:01:44,226
something a little more
<i>Saved By The Bell-ish.</i>

923
01:01:44,285 --> 01:01:45,494
All right?

924
01:01:47,622 --> 01:01:50,374
- He seems a little shaky.
- Don't worry about him.

925
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:53,336
If the killer is following a pattern,
then maybe we can figure out who's next.

926
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:55,463
I wouldn't follow a killer's pattern.

927
01:01:55,546 --> 01:01:58,799
We were all involved in Woodsboro.
Could be any one of us.

928
01:01:58,883 --> 01:02:00,801
So what do you wanna do, bonehead?

929
01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:03,221
You just want to sit here and wait
and see who drops next?

930
01:02:03,304 --> 01:02:05,848
I don't know... “Phonehead.”

931
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:11,437
Gale's not here!

932
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:13,481
<i>I'm not interrupting anything, am I?</i>

933
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:16,067
<i>You three look deep in thought.</i>

934
01:02:16,651 --> 01:02:22,490
<i>Have you ever felt a knife cut through
human flesh and scrape the bone beneath?</i>

935
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:24,450
It's him.

936
01:02:25,326 --> 01:02:26,994
- Who?
- The killer.

937
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:29,538
He can see us.

938
01:02:35,127 --> 01:02:38,381
- Just keep him on the phone.
- What do you want me to say?

939
01:02:38,464 --> 01:02:41,342
I don't know.
Just keep him talking. Come on, Gale.

940
01:02:42,843 --> 01:02:44,720
- What are we doing?
- Hi.

941
01:02:44,804 --> 01:02:46,597
- So—
- Look for somebody with a cell phone.

942
01:02:46,681 --> 01:02:49,600
- What's your favorite scary movie?
<i>- You'll never find me.</i>

943
01:02:49,684 --> 01:02:52,019
Yeah? What do you care?
Let 'em have their fun.

944
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:55,856
So, what's up?

945
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:58,526
<i>What's</i> your <i>favorite scary movie?</i>

946
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:03,489
<i>Showgirls.</i>
Absolutely frightening. What's yours?

947
01:03:04,573 --> 01:03:06,158
- Sorry.
- What's your problem?

948
01:03:06,242 --> 01:03:09,328
Wait. Let me guess.
<i>The House on Sorority Row?</i>

949
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:12,790
<i>Dorm That Dripped Blood?
Splatter University?</i>

950
01:03:12,873 --> 01:03:15,293
<i>Graduation Day? Final Exam?</i>

951
01:03:15,376 --> 01:03:17,378
- Am I close?
<i>- Closer than you think.</i>

952
01:03:19,046 --> 01:03:20,798
<i>Too slow, geek.</i>

953
01:03:20,881 --> 01:03:23,384
<i>Do you want to die?</i>

954
01:03:23,467 --> 01:03:27,179
Is that the best you can do? Because Billy
and Stu were much more original.

955
01:03:27,263 --> 01:03:29,056
- Give me that.
- Hey!

956
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:31,559
- Who's this?
<i>- Who's</i> this?

957
01:03:31,642 --> 01:03:33,436
Gale Weathers,
author of <i>The Woodsboro Murders.</i>

958
01:03:33,519 --> 01:03:35,021
<i>- Who?</i>
- Come on.

959
01:03:36,731 --> 01:03:37,898
Okay.

960
01:03:37,982 --> 01:03:39,900
He's gotta be around here someplace.

961
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:42,528
He's just playing with us.

962
01:03:44,905 --> 01:03:46,991
White male suspect, nine o'clock.

963
01:03:47,074 --> 01:03:49,744
- My clock or your clock?
- Your clock.

964
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:53,331
I'll go around the back.

965
01:03:54,665 --> 01:03:57,251
<i>Why are you even here, Randy?</i>

966
01:03:57,335 --> 01:03:59,754
<i>You'll never be the leading man.</i>

967
01:04:00,588 --> 01:04:02,131
Fuck you!

968
01:04:02,214 --> 01:04:05,676
<i>No matter how hard you try,
you'll never be the hero...</i>

969
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,512
<i>and you'll never, ever get the girl.</i>

970
01:04:08,596 --> 01:04:11,849
- Hey!
- Shit! Sorry. Hey, man—

971
01:04:11,932 --> 01:04:14,518
<i>Wrong guy, dead boy.</i>

972
01:04:15,102 --> 01:04:19,315
Oh, yeah? Let's redirect a moment,
Mr. I'm-So-Original.

973
01:04:21,317 --> 01:04:23,277
- What's she doing?
- I don't know.

974
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:25,446
Hey!

975
01:04:25,529 --> 01:04:27,198
<i>- What just happened?</i>
- What the hell?

976
01:04:27,281 --> 01:04:28,949
- Dewey. Dewey.
- A citizen's arrest.

977
01:04:29,033 --> 01:04:30,451
- Can I help you?
- No.

978
01:04:30,534 --> 01:04:32,745
<i>- Hello? Hello?</i>
- Sorry.

979
01:04:32,828 --> 01:04:34,538
- Sorry.
- Beg your pardon.

980
01:04:34,622 --> 01:04:39,210
Where's your innovation? Why copycat
two high school loser-ass dickheads?

981
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:41,921
Stu was a pussy-ass wet rag.

982
01:04:42,004 --> 01:04:45,216
And Billy Loomis.
Billy Loomis! What the fuck!

983
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:49,887
Jesus! What a rat-lookin',
homo-repressed mama's boy.

984
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:51,889
Why not set your goals higher?

985
01:04:51,972 --> 01:04:54,350
You wanna be one of the big boys?

986
01:04:54,975 --> 01:04:59,021
Manson, Bundy, O.J., Son—

987
01:05:36,183 --> 01:05:39,395
- Where's Randy?
- I don't know. This guy just grabbed me.

988
01:05:39,478 --> 01:05:41,897
- No, I'm okay, Mom.
- I don't see him.

989
01:05:44,775 --> 01:05:46,735
Randy!

990
01:05:48,821 --> 01:05:50,739
What's goin' on?

991
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:54,368
Yo, man. Who broke my window?

992
01:06:28,736 --> 01:06:30,696
Did your computer just freeze?

993
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:34,950
You have an instant message.
That's all. Just hit alt-M.

994
01:06:35,034 --> 01:06:36,952
Yeah, but I'm not signed on.

995
01:06:37,036 --> 01:06:39,914
Someone here in the library.
All the terminals are connected.

996
01:06:58,349 --> 01:06:59,642
He's here.

997
01:07:00,768 --> 01:07:04,230
Shit. Get her away from the computer.
Sid, it's probably just a sick joke.

998
01:07:08,150 --> 01:07:10,236
- May I see your screen, please?
- Wait right here.

999
01:07:10,319 --> 01:07:11,737
Yeah.

1000
01:07:19,703 --> 01:07:21,288
Shit.

1001
01:07:22,164 --> 01:07:24,333
- Sid, you okay?
- Cotton.

1002
01:07:24,416 --> 01:07:27,670
- Can we talk for a sec?
- This isn't a good time.

1003
01:07:28,295 --> 01:07:30,130
Come on, Sid. You sent me to prison.

1004
01:07:30,214 --> 01:07:32,841
I did over a year for you.
You can give me two minutes.

1005
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:36,262
Cotton, I'm sorry. Every day I'm sorry.
I don't know how to apologize any more.

1006
01:07:36,345 --> 01:07:40,057
Don't be sorry. Sorry-schmorry, Sid.
I have the solution to all of our problems.

1007
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,850
What? What are you talking about?

1008
01:07:41,934 --> 01:07:44,562
First of all, forget Gale Weathers.

1009
01:07:44,645 --> 01:07:46,564
She doesn't get it, Sidney.
She doesn't see the story.

1010
01:07:46,647 --> 01:07:48,321
Between you and me,
she wouldn't see the story

1011
01:07:48,346 --> 01:07:49,841
if it smacked her in
the side of the head.

1012
01:07:49,900 --> 01:07:51,986
Have you read that book?

1013
01:07:52,069 --> 01:07:55,906
Which brings me to my point. Who calls me
out of the blue, but Diane Sawyer.

1014
01:07:55,990 --> 01:07:57,908
Believe me, Sid, I was as shocked as you are.

1015
01:07:57,992 --> 01:08:00,744
Anyway, she tells me that
if you and I go on the air together...

1016
01:08:00,828 --> 01:08:03,163
- she will give us the entire hour.
- What?

1017
01:08:03,247 --> 01:08:07,251
We're talking prime time, Sid.
You, me and Diane Sawyer.

1018
01:08:07,334 --> 01:08:09,712
- Cotton, I can't.
- No, no. Sidney, look.

1019
01:08:09,795 --> 01:08:12,172
If this is about money,
it's not like we're not getting paid.

1020
01:08:12,256 --> 01:08:14,169
There's $1 0,000 each,
not to mention what I've

1021
01:08:14,194 --> 01:08:15,867
got going on the side
with the 900 number.

1022
01:08:15,926 --> 01:08:16,927
Cotton—

1023
01:08:17,011 --> 01:08:19,138
I know, I know, I know.
You don't like the press.

1024
01:08:19,221 --> 01:08:21,473
I know that, and I respect it, Sidney.

1025
01:08:21,557 --> 01:08:23,350
But, Sidney—

1026
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:28,022
It's Diane Sawyer. Hello?

1027
01:08:28,105 --> 01:08:33,444
She's a class act. Sidney, this could be
some very, very heavy exposure.

1028
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:36,196
I'm sorry.

1029
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:41,035
Look. Between the movie and the book,
people know the truth.

1030
01:08:42,411 --> 01:08:46,582
Let's get on with our lives. There's been
enough exposure. Why would you want any more?

1031
01:08:46,665 --> 01:08:49,418
Why? I don't know, Sidney.

1032
01:08:49,501 --> 01:08:51,795
Maybe because I fucking deserve
a little exposure?

1033
01:08:52,379 --> 01:08:54,381
Come on, Sidney.
You dragged my name through the mud...

1034
01:08:54,465 --> 01:08:56,717
everybody thinks
I'm some kind of psycho killer...

1035
01:08:56,800 --> 01:09:00,137
and all I'm asking for is one little
<i>fucking</i> Diane Sawyer interview...

1036
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:02,264
to maybe get <i>my</i> side of the story straight.

1037
01:09:02,348 --> 01:09:05,684
I don't think I'm being unreasonable
in that request, Sidney.

1038
01:09:05,768 --> 01:09:07,853
Do you? Honestly?

1039
01:09:09,563 --> 01:09:12,399
I'm... sorry, Cotton, but no.

1040
01:09:15,152 --> 01:09:16,654
You're sorry.

1041
01:09:17,321 --> 01:09:19,865
Yeah, I bet you're real sorry, Sidney.

1042
01:09:20,866 --> 01:09:25,245
Such a good angle, Sidney.
Lovable and fucked-up Sidney Prescott!

1043
01:09:25,329 --> 01:09:27,581
Everybody's favorite little victim!

1044
01:09:28,624 --> 01:09:30,167
- Ow! What are you doing?
- Relax.

1045
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,002
- Put your hands on top of your head.
- Sidney!

1046
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:34,380
- Shut the fuck up!
- Jesus! I'm not Billy Loomis!

1047
01:09:34,463 --> 01:09:36,423
You killed him. He's dead. Remember?

1048
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:40,219
Run it by me one more time, will ya?

1049
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:44,306
- Why did you attack Sidney Prescott?
- There was no attack.

1050
01:09:44,390 --> 01:09:46,517
We were talking very heatedly.

1051
01:09:46,600 --> 01:09:51,105
Miss Prescott and I...
have a very complicated past.

1052
01:09:52,523 --> 01:09:54,358
I didn't think that was a crime.

1053
01:09:54,441 --> 01:09:56,610
- No, but homicide is.
- Okay. Then book me.

1054
01:09:57,653 --> 01:10:00,030
Book me. Okay? Look.

1055
01:10:00,739 --> 01:10:03,060
I don't know about homicide,
but you've definitely

1056
01:10:03,085 --> 01:10:05,244
got me for raising my
voice in a public library.

1057
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:10,290
We're dealing with four murders here.
You watch your mouth.

1058
01:10:13,961 --> 01:10:15,879
It shouldn't have been Randy.

1059
01:10:16,463 --> 01:10:18,132
It should have been me.

1060
01:10:19,216 --> 01:10:20,801
No.

1061
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:25,139
- I should call his mother.
- Sid, I already made that phone call.

1062
01:10:29,852 --> 01:10:31,854
Are you okay?

1063
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:34,940
Stop treating me like glass, Dewey.
I'm not gonna break.

1064
01:10:35,023 --> 01:10:36,650
It's okay to break.

1065
01:10:38,152 --> 01:10:40,028
That's not gonna happen.

1066
01:10:40,112 --> 01:10:42,781
You better hope your alibi's airtight.

1067
01:10:42,865 --> 01:10:46,618
Could I please remind everyone here
that I'm an innocent man?

1068
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:49,204
Don't you watch TV? <i>Current Edition?</i>

1069
01:10:49,288 --> 01:10:51,498
Thought it was a very insightful program...

1070
01:10:51,582 --> 01:10:54,543
on which it was made abundantly clear
that I'm an innocent man.

1071
01:10:54,626 --> 01:10:58,297
So until you find me standing over a dead
body with a knife in my hand...

1072
01:10:58,380 --> 01:11:00,758
I think you better treat me
with the rights and privileges...

1073
01:11:00,841 --> 01:11:03,844
accorded to every innocent citizen
in this country.

1074
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:11,727
Is there some problem
with the word “innocent”?

1075
01:11:11,810 --> 01:11:13,854
I know. It's a big one. Chief?

1076
01:11:25,032 --> 01:11:27,659
- What's going on?
- We have to let him go.

1077
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,912
- Why?
- We don't have anything on him.

1078
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:35,834
Sign here.

1079
01:11:40,714 --> 01:11:41,882
Gale.

1080
01:11:43,217 --> 01:11:45,552
Enjoying the show? The cops are funny.

1081
01:11:45,636 --> 01:11:49,431
- What do you think you're doing?
- Waiting for my 1 5 minutes of fame.

1082
01:11:49,515 --> 01:11:51,892
You can understand that, can't you, Gale?

1083
01:11:54,645 --> 01:11:56,563
Don't do anything stupid, Cotton.

1084
01:11:56,647 --> 01:12:00,651
Gale, you were so instrumental
in my freedom.

1085
01:12:01,235 --> 01:12:03,904
You're not having
character doubts now, are you?

1086
01:12:09,827 --> 01:12:11,537
Sidney, if you change your mind—

1087
01:12:11,620 --> 01:12:13,372
Come on. Take a hike.

1088
01:12:15,749 --> 01:12:17,668
Sorry about that.

1089
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:19,503
What a creep.

1090
01:12:20,087 --> 01:12:22,089
They're gonna take you somewhere safe, Sid.

1091
01:12:22,631 --> 01:12:24,800
Yeah? Where's that?

1092
01:12:24,883 --> 01:12:27,928
I don't know, but I'll be there with you.

1093
01:12:31,265 --> 01:12:33,100
We should get going.

1094
01:12:33,892 --> 01:12:36,520
We'll take you by the dorm.
You can pack some things.

1095
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:39,356
We've issued a campus lock-in this evening.

1096
01:12:39,439 --> 01:12:42,776
- No one's allowed out after dark, okay?
- Yeah.

1097
01:12:43,318 --> 01:12:45,654
Who's doing this, Dewey?

1098
01:12:45,737 --> 01:12:47,489
If not Cotton, then who?

1099
01:12:48,574 --> 01:12:50,909
I don't know, Sid, but I'll find him.

1100
01:12:56,748 --> 01:12:58,500
- Gale.
- Any leads, Gale?

1101
01:12:58,584 --> 01:13:00,294
Do you think the killer will come after you?

1102
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:02,254
How does it feel to be
on the other side of the news?

1103
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:04,548
- There's Cotton. Cotton! Hey!
- How are you, Bob?

1104
01:13:04,631 --> 01:13:07,050
- Good. Are you still a suspect?
- It's all been a huge misunderstanding.

1105
01:13:07,134 --> 01:13:09,344
- Cotton, have you been officially released?
- Gale. Hang on one second.

1106
01:13:09,428 --> 01:13:12,472
How about a photo?
No? You look great.

1107
01:13:12,556 --> 01:13:14,600
- How you holding up, Gale?
- I'm sorry, Bob. You were asking?

1108
01:13:14,683 --> 01:13:18,103
Must be scary knowing somebody's out there
waiting and watching, enjoying all this.

1109
01:13:18,186 --> 01:13:20,147
- How does that make you feel?
- Look, local woman!

1110
01:13:20,230 --> 01:13:22,816
I know that you hold me up
as your career template...

1111
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:26,695
and it gives you some sort of... charge
to challenge me...

1112
01:13:26,778 --> 01:13:28,447
but give it a rest!

1113
01:13:30,866 --> 01:13:32,868
You're right. I'm sorry.

1114
01:13:32,951 --> 01:13:34,870
It was the wrong time. I'm sorry.

1115
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:41,387
What's going on?

1116
01:13:41,412 --> 01:13:44,070
Let's see.
For starters, they impounded my van.

1117
01:13:44,129 --> 01:13:46,882
It's now an official crime scene,
thanks to you.

1118
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:49,426
Here's your footage. Enjoy.

1119
01:13:49,509 --> 01:13:51,428
See ya. Wouldn't wanna be ya.

1120
01:13:51,511 --> 01:13:53,430
Joel, I need you!

1121
01:13:53,513 --> 01:13:56,808
No, you need to have your head examined.

1122
01:14:10,197 --> 01:14:12,199
I feel bad, Dewey.

1123
01:14:14,034 --> 01:14:15,994
I feel really bad.

1124
01:14:17,579 --> 01:14:19,498
I never say that because...

1125
01:14:19,581 --> 01:14:21,792
I never feel bad about anything.

1126
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:24,836
But I feel bad now.

1127
01:14:28,924 --> 01:14:30,884
Is this just another...

1128
01:14:32,260 --> 01:14:34,680
brilliant Gale Weathers performance?

1129
01:14:35,222 --> 01:14:38,558
There are no cameras here.
I just wanna find this fucker!

1130
01:14:43,105 --> 01:14:45,232
I really do.

1131
01:14:47,693 --> 01:14:48,944
Me too.

1132
01:14:59,871 --> 01:15:01,790
Could I give you a hand?

1133
01:15:05,502 --> 01:15:07,087
What's in here?

1134
01:15:08,797 --> 01:15:11,758
Just some crowd footage that Joel shot.

1135
01:15:14,845 --> 01:15:16,763
Hey, wait a minute.

1136
01:15:21,184 --> 01:15:24,855
If the killer really is watching
and relishing every minute...

1137
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:27,190
then he'd be here on these tapes, right?

1138
01:15:27,274 --> 01:15:30,277
- At each crime scene.
- It's worth a look.

1139
01:15:33,989 --> 01:15:35,949
It's definitely worth a look.

1140
01:15:54,134 --> 01:15:55,260
This way.

1141
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,638
Dubbing Room.

1142
01:15:59,181 --> 01:16:00,724
Editorial.

1143
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:02,726
- Video Archive.
- Yeah.

1144
01:16:07,397 --> 01:16:09,149
- It's locked.
- Can you pick it?

1145
01:16:09,691 --> 01:16:12,569
- That would be breaking and entering.
- No shit.

1146
01:16:13,153 --> 01:16:15,697
There's gotta be a VCR
around here somewhere.

1147
01:16:15,781 --> 01:16:17,699
What's in there?

1148
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,787
- Now we're gettin' somewhere.
- Perfect.

1149
01:16:36,676 --> 01:16:38,637
Start with this one.

1150
01:16:40,347 --> 01:16:41,681
Sorry.

1151
01:16:42,808 --> 01:16:45,310
- Ow.
- I'm sorry.

1152
01:16:46,603 --> 01:16:48,146
- Did I hurt you?
- No.

1153

<i>- My name is Chief Louis Hartley—

That's not my footage.

1174
01:18:22,282 --> 01:18:23,909
<i>Outside.</i>

1175
01:18:27,829 --> 01:18:29,080
<i>Fuck you!</i>

1176
01:18:29,164 --> 01:18:32,042
<i>No matter how hard you try,
you'll never be the hero...</i>

1177
01:18:32,125 --> 01:18:35,003
<i>and you'll never, ever get the girl.</i>

1178
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:38,006
<i>- Sorry.
- Wrong guy, dead boy.</i>

1179
01:18:43,178 --> 01:18:44,429
Stay here.

1180
01:18:44,512 --> 01:18:46,306
No, Dewey, don't!

1181
01:19:03,156 --> 01:19:04,449
Dewey!

1182
01:19:08,662 --> 01:19:10,330
There's no one there.

1183
01:19:12,040 --> 01:19:13,416
Gale!

1184
01:21:09,282 --> 01:21:10,784
Fuck!

1185
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:34,057
Gale!

1186
01:21:34,641 --> 01:21:35,809
Gale?

1187
01:21:55,620 --> 01:21:56,913
Gale!

1188
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,084
No.

1189
01:22:44,377 --> 01:22:45,795
No!

1190
01:23:30,632 --> 01:23:31,883
So.

1191
01:23:32,634 --> 01:23:33,885
So.

1192
01:23:35,303 --> 01:23:37,222
Listen, Sid.

1193
01:23:38,515 --> 01:23:40,683
Hey. Wait up.

1194
01:23:40,767 --> 01:23:43,728
- She's fine.
- I'm her therapist.

1195
01:23:45,605 --> 01:23:47,106
Bye, Derek.

1196
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:48,942
Bye.

1197
01:23:49,901 --> 01:23:51,903
We better get going.

1198
01:23:56,783 --> 01:23:58,701
When this is all over...

1199
01:24:00,870 --> 01:24:02,830
I'll still be here.

1200
01:24:38,449 --> 01:24:41,327
You! Prepare to die.

1201
01:24:42,787 --> 01:24:45,623
- You gave up your letters.
- Oh, man.

1202
01:24:46,791 --> 01:24:49,460
- Get him, guys!
- I'm not— Guys—

1203
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:52,255
To Troy! We march!

1204
01:24:55,383 --> 01:24:57,427
This is so romantic.

1205
01:24:57,510 --> 01:24:59,679
And so Greek!

1206
01:25:10,189 --> 01:25:12,400
That's cold! That's cold.

1207
01:25:25,079 --> 01:25:26,748
Who do you love, baby?

1208
01:25:26,831 --> 01:25:30,752
- Sidney.
- Did you say “my Omega Kappa Beta brothers”?

1209
01:25:30,835 --> 01:25:33,004
No, I said Sidney!

1210
01:25:55,109 --> 01:25:57,028
So, where are you taking us anyway?

1211
01:25:57,111 --> 01:25:59,906
If we tell you, we'll have to kill you.

1212
01:26:01,157 --> 01:26:03,201
Don't ask, don't tell.

1213
01:26:11,042 --> 01:26:12,919
Son of a bitch!

1214
01:26:18,716 --> 01:26:20,802
No! Shit!

1215
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:35,441
Help me, baby! Help!

1216
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:40,196
Oh, my God!

1217
01:26:40,279 --> 01:26:41,906
Out of the car, you fucker.

1218
01:26:49,706 --> 01:26:52,625
Get down back there!
Come on, you son of a bitch!

1219
01:26:52,709 --> 01:26:54,627
I'll blow your fuckin' head—

1220
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,209
Is he dead?

1221
01:27:36,169 --> 01:27:38,171
I don't think so.

1222
01:27:39,380 --> 01:27:41,340
No, he's still breathing.

1223
01:27:47,388 --> 01:27:48,890
Is he dead?

1224
01:27:48,973 --> 01:27:51,184
Oh, God. I think so.

1225
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:01,861
- How are you supposed to get outta here?
- We're not. It's a cop car.

1226
01:28:07,074 --> 01:28:08,701
Wait, wait, wait.

1227
01:28:11,412 --> 01:28:15,374
- No. Don't touch that, girl.
- Hallie, it's the only way out. Help me out.

1228
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:20,922
Come on.

1229
01:28:22,799 --> 01:28:24,509
Okay, okay, okay.

1230
01:28:47,782 --> 01:28:49,575
We're jammed up against a wall.

1231
01:28:53,538 --> 01:28:55,456
Oh, my God.

1232
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:12,431
Oh, my God.

1233
01:29:14,100 --> 01:29:16,519
No, Sid. Don't. Sid.

1234
01:29:23,484 --> 01:29:25,278
God, I hate this shit.

1235
01:29:28,114 --> 01:29:30,992
Oh, my God. Don't do that again.

1236
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:45,089
Try the window.

1237
01:29:59,812 --> 01:30:01,731
- Shit!
- Get me the fuck outta here, Sid.

1238
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:04,775
I can't. The door's jammed.
You have to go through the front.

1239
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:07,486
- No fuckin' way.
- Hallie, do it.

1240
01:30:08,029 --> 01:30:09,614
Go on.

1241
01:30:09,697 --> 01:30:11,449
Hallie, go on.

1242
01:30:20,374 --> 01:30:23,461
Okay. Okay, that's right.

1243
01:30:26,464 --> 01:30:29,550
Okay. Okay, that's good.

1244
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:34,931
Right through his eye.

1245
01:30:35,014 --> 01:30:36,474
Come on.

1246
01:30:37,141 --> 01:30:39,143
That's good. Easy. Easy.

1247
01:30:40,144 --> 01:30:41,854
He's not gonna hurt you.

1248
01:30:41,938 --> 01:30:43,356
Easy.

1249
01:30:44,023 --> 01:30:45,650
Come on. Watch your feet.

1250
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:51,697
Okay.

1251
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,241
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

1252
01:30:57,828 --> 01:30:59,872
- Hallie.
- What?

1253
01:31:01,165 --> 01:31:03,000
I wanna know who it is.

1254
01:31:03,084 --> 01:31:05,920
- Oh, no. Come on, Sid. Let's just go.
- I'm going back.

1255
01:31:06,003 --> 01:31:07,922
Look. Stupid people go back.

1256
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:11,258
Smart people run. We're smart people,
so we should just get the fuck outta here.

1257
01:31:11,342 --> 01:31:13,219
Hallie, I'm sick of running.

1258
01:31:13,886 --> 01:31:16,681
- If we know who it is, then it's over.
- No, we can just get the police.

1259
01:31:16,764 --> 01:31:19,809
Yeah, and when we come back,
he'll be gone. It'll only take a minute.

1260
01:31:19,892 --> 01:31:21,477
- I have to do this.
- Sid.

1261
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,271
No, Sid. Come back! Sid!

1262
01:31:25,064 --> 01:31:26,941
Sid, come back.

1263
01:31:40,246 --> 01:31:42,248
- Oh, shit.
- What?

1264
01:31:43,457 --> 01:31:45,584
- He's gone.
- What?

1265
01:31:47,628 --> 01:31:48,713
No!

1266
01:32:15,698 --> 01:32:17,241
Gale.

1267
01:32:18,701 --> 01:32:20,411
- No, no, no.
- Get away from me.

1268
01:32:20,494 --> 01:32:23,247
No. This isn't what it looks like.
I found Dewey.

1269
01:32:23,330 --> 01:32:25,666
I tried to help him. No. Gale, wait.

1270
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:27,960
Gale. Gale, wait! Gale!

1271
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:32,256
Shit.

1272
01:32:37,803 --> 01:32:40,014
- The campus is extremely quiet.
- Help me!

1273
01:32:40,097 --> 01:32:41,891
The curfew in full effect.

1274
01:32:41,974 --> 01:32:45,102
- Give me the goddamn phone!
- Gale. I was right in the middle of a story.

1275
01:32:45,186 --> 01:32:47,980
- I've got your goddamn story!
- What's the matter?

1276
01:32:48,064 --> 01:32:48,544
<i>Operator.</i>

1277
01:32:48,569 --> 01:32:49,982
Operator, this is an emergency!
Get the police!

1278
01:32:50,066 --> 01:32:52,818
- What's happening?
- The killer! It's Cotton fucking Weary!

1279
01:32:52,902 --> 01:32:54,987
Cotton Weary?

1280
01:33:43,536 --> 01:33:44,870
Hello?

1281
01:33:48,874 --> 01:33:50,292
Gus?

1282
01:33:55,673 --> 01:33:56,882
Hello?

1283
01:34:02,805 --> 01:34:04,306
Hello?

1284
01:34:15,192 --> 01:34:16,610
Hello?

1285
01:34:18,737 --> 01:34:19,905
Hello?

1286
01:35:05,951 --> 01:35:07,286
Derek?

1287
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:13,584
God.

1288
01:35:14,210 --> 01:35:15,669
Derek.

1289
01:35:16,337 --> 01:35:17,630
Derek!

1290
01:35:18,214 --> 01:35:19,673
Oh, God.

1291
01:35:19,757 --> 01:35:21,759
Thank you. Thank God, Sid.

1292
01:35:21,842 --> 01:35:23,636
Thought I was gonna be up there
till opening night.

1293
01:35:23,719 --> 01:35:26,513
- Who tied these? We gotta get outta here.
- The brothers got me, Sid.

1294
01:35:26,597 --> 01:35:30,434
- Derek, he's after me. He killed Hallie.
- What are you talking about?

1295
01:35:30,517 --> 01:35:33,103
- The killer. He's here.
- Where?

1296
01:35:33,187 --> 01:35:34,647
Right here.

1297
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,901
- You're fast, Sid.
- Get me down. Hurry!

1298
01:35:38,984 --> 01:35:43,989
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You really wanna trust your boyfriend?

1299
01:35:44,615 --> 01:35:47,826
Don't you know history repeats itself?

1300
01:35:48,786 --> 01:35:49,828
Sid?

1301
01:35:57,002 --> 01:35:58,545
Mickey.

1302
01:35:59,672 --> 01:36:01,674
Surprise, Sidney.

1303
01:36:02,925 --> 01:36:04,468
What the fuck?

1304
01:36:04,551 --> 01:36:07,680
Since Derek here disappeared on my ass...

1305
01:36:07,763 --> 01:36:10,599
I've been on my own all fuckin' night.

1306
01:36:11,392 --> 01:36:14,019
- Thanks a lot, partner.
- You motherfucker!

1307
01:36:14,103 --> 01:36:16,689
Sid, he's crazy.
You know me better than that.

1308
01:36:16,772 --> 01:36:21,318
Come on, Sid. I gotta have a partner.

1309
01:36:21,402 --> 01:36:24,154
I couldn't have possibly done this alone.

1310
01:36:24,238 --> 01:36:26,532
- God. Derek.
- Sid.

1311
01:36:27,199 --> 01:36:28,450
No, no. Sid. Sid.

1312
01:36:28,534 --> 01:36:30,119
No, no, no.

1313
01:36:30,202 --> 01:36:32,705
It's okay, Derek. We got her.

1314
01:36:33,998 --> 01:36:35,207
Sid, he's lying!

1315
01:36:35,291 --> 01:36:38,168
Sid! Sid! Untie me.

1316
01:36:38,252 --> 01:36:40,212
Sid, untie me.

1317
01:36:41,505 --> 01:36:43,507
Boyfriend. Killer. Boyfriend. Killer.

1318
01:36:43,590 --> 01:36:46,719
Sid, the man is lying! Untie me. Sid.

1319
01:36:46,802 --> 01:36:49,722
Untie me. Untie me.

1320
01:36:49,805 --> 01:36:53,767
What do you think, Derek?
Sidney experiencing some déjà vu?

1321
01:36:53,851 --> 01:36:56,979
No. No. I am gonna fuckin' kill you!

1322
01:36:57,062 --> 01:37:00,357
Fuckin' kill you! You are dead! Dead!

1323
01:37:03,652 --> 01:37:04,820
Derek.

1324
01:37:10,951 --> 01:37:12,453
I'm sorry.

1325
01:37:13,746 --> 01:37:15,789
I never...

1326
01:37:16,665 --> 01:37:20,085
would've... hurt you.

1327
01:37:21,253 --> 01:37:22,421
Never.

1328
01:37:28,218 --> 01:37:29,762
No.

1329
01:37:34,516 --> 01:37:37,311
You should really deal with
your trust issues, Sid.

1330
01:37:37,394 --> 01:37:41,023
Poor Derek. He's completely innocent.
And such a nice boy too.

1331
01:37:41,106 --> 01:37:43,025
He's bright and funny and handsome.

1332
01:37:43,108 --> 01:37:45,694
Decent singing voice.
And he was gonna be a doctor.

1333
01:37:45,778 --> 01:37:48,739
This was just the kind of boy
you'd like to take home to Mom.

1334
01:37:48,822 --> 01:37:51,283
- If you had a mom.
- Fuck you!

1335
01:37:51,909 --> 01:37:54,328
So vulgar.
Did Billy let you talk to him this way?

1336
01:37:54,411 --> 01:37:56,538
Billy was a sick fuck, just like you.

1337
01:37:57,122 --> 01:38:00,000
No. Billy was a sick fuck
who tried to get away with it.

1338
01:38:00,084 --> 01:38:02,795
Mickey is a sick fuck
who wants to get caught. Yeah!

1339
01:38:02,878 --> 01:38:06,215
See, I've got my whole defense planned out.

1340
01:38:06,298 --> 01:38:08,926
I'm gonna blame the movies.

1341
01:38:09,009 --> 01:38:11,637
It's pretty cool, huh?
It hasn't been done before.

1342
01:38:11,720 --> 01:38:15,265
You see, this is just the beginning,
a prelude to the trial.

1343
01:38:15,349 --> 01:38:19,061
That's where the real fun is,
'cause these days it's all about the trial.

1344
01:38:19,144 --> 01:38:22,231
Can't you see it?
The effects of cinema violence on society.

1345
01:38:22,314 --> 01:38:25,109
I'll get Dershowitz or Cochran
to represent me.

1346
01:38:25,192 --> 01:38:27,486
Bob Dole on the witness stand in my defense.

1347
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:29,905
Hell, the Christian Coalition'll
pay my legal fees.

1348
01:38:29,988 --> 01:38:32,199
It's airtight, Sid.

1349
01:38:33,283 --> 01:38:34,660
I'm an innocent victim.

1350
01:38:36,161 --> 01:38:38,330
- You're a psychotic.
- Yeah, well—

1351
01:38:39,415 --> 01:38:41,291
That'll be our little secret.

1352
01:38:41,375 --> 01:38:45,421
'Cause people love a good trial.
It's like theater. They're dyin' for it.

1353
01:38:45,504 --> 01:38:47,965
And I've worked hard
to give the audience what they want.

1354
01:38:48,048 --> 01:38:52,469
See? That's what Billy was good at.
He knew... it's all about...

1355
01:38:52,553 --> 01:38:54,388
- execution.
- Yeah?

1356
01:38:55,639 --> 01:38:57,891
You're forgetting one thing
about Billy Loomis.

1357
01:38:57,975 --> 01:38:59,893
Oh, yeah? What's that?

1358
01:39:01,353 --> 01:39:02,855
I fucking killed him.

1359
01:39:04,189 --> 01:39:05,691
You piece of shit!

1360
01:39:32,092 --> 01:39:33,552
Sid.

1361
01:39:35,429 --> 01:39:37,514
You got a Linda Hamilton thing going.

1362
01:39:38,056 --> 01:39:40,434
No, no. It's nice. I like it.

1363
01:39:41,101 --> 01:39:43,061
Now, who's doin' that?

1364
01:39:44,646 --> 01:39:47,608
Could that be the mystery guest
waiting in the wings?

1365
01:39:49,234 --> 01:39:51,778
Told ya I had a partner, Sid.

1366
01:39:51,862 --> 01:39:53,864
Surprise cameo just for you.

1367
01:39:58,827 --> 01:40:00,204
Gale.

1368
01:40:10,088 --> 01:40:11,632
Mrs. Loomis?

1369
01:40:13,509 --> 01:40:14,468
What?

1370
01:40:14,551 --> 01:40:17,095
Billy's mother!

1371
01:40:18,388 --> 01:40:21,391
Nice twist, huh?
Didn't see it comin', did ya?

1372
01:40:23,727 --> 01:40:27,397
Jesus. It can't be.
I've seen pictures of you.

1373
01:40:27,481 --> 01:40:29,650
This is 60 pounds and a lot of work later.

1374
01:40:29,733 --> 01:40:32,444
It's called a makeover. You should try it.

1375
01:40:32,528 --> 01:40:34,446
Look a little tired yourself there, Gale.

1376
01:40:36,156 --> 01:40:38,575
So you two are in this together?

1377
01:40:38,659 --> 01:40:41,537
Yeah, well, had to have financing.

1378
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:43,914
Tuition's expensive.

1379
01:40:43,997 --> 01:40:49,086
Deb there, my backer—we met on the Internet.
Psycho Web site. Classifieds.

1380
01:40:49,169 --> 01:40:53,131
There's only an estimated 97
active serial killers in the country today.

1381
01:40:53,215 --> 01:40:56,969
So Mickey here was quite a find.
Definitely one on the way up.

1382
01:40:57,052 --> 01:40:59,498
All he needed was a little
guidance and nurturing.

1383
01:40:59,523 --> 01:41:00,889
As only a mother can do.

1384
01:41:00,973 --> 01:41:03,684
Told you it was gonna work.
Wait till the trial!

1385
01:41:03,767 --> 01:41:05,727
It is gonna <i>rock!</i>

1386
01:41:05,811 --> 01:41:09,273
Oh, Mickey. There's not gonna be a trial.

1387
01:41:17,656 --> 01:41:18,448
Gale!

1388
01:41:31,461 --> 01:41:33,338
Two birds, one stone.

1389
01:41:35,924 --> 01:41:39,469
Mickey was a good boy, but, my God,
that whole blame the movies motive—

1390
01:41:39,553 --> 01:41:41,555
Did you buy that for one second?

1391
01:41:42,139 --> 01:41:44,725
Poor boy was completely out of his mind.

1392
01:41:44,808 --> 01:41:48,186
- And you're not?
- No. I'm very sane.

1393
01:41:49,354 --> 01:41:51,815
My motive isn't as '90s as Mickey's.

1394
01:41:51,898 --> 01:41:55,277
Mine is just good old-fashioned revenge.

1395
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,529
You killed my son.

1396
01:41:58,280 --> 01:42:02,034
And now I kill you.
And I can't think of anything more rational.

1397
01:42:03,076 --> 01:42:04,828
You're never gonna get away with this.

1398
01:42:04,911 --> 01:42:06,872
Of course I will.

1399
01:42:07,372 --> 01:42:09,583
Everything's traceable back to Mickey.

1400
01:42:09,666 --> 01:42:12,210
Including the cop gun
he used to kill everybody.

1401
01:42:12,753 --> 01:42:14,755
But let's just suppose that you...

1402
01:42:14,838 --> 01:42:17,507
had gotten hold of the other cop's gun.

1403
01:42:17,591 --> 01:42:20,969
And you chased Mickey. And there was
a big shoot-out and a big scuffle.

1404
01:42:21,053 --> 01:42:25,057
And you shot Mickey, killed Mickey dead.

1405
01:42:26,808 --> 01:42:30,437
But not before he got off one shot at you.

1406
01:42:31,355 --> 01:42:35,067
Okay. So, have I covered everything?

1407
01:42:35,150 --> 01:42:37,694
Are there any questions, any comments?
You know what though?

1408
01:42:37,778 --> 01:42:40,697
Who give a flyin' fuck anyway?

1409
01:42:40,781 --> 01:42:45,452
Let 'em try and track down the second
possible killer. Debbie Salt doesn't exist.

1410
01:42:45,535 --> 01:42:47,371
You're as crazy as your son was.

1411
01:42:48,914 --> 01:42:51,249
What did you just say?

1412
01:42:52,209 --> 01:42:55,462
Was that a negative,
disparaging remark about my son?

1413
01:42:55,545 --> 01:42:57,005
About my Billy?

1414
01:42:57,089 --> 01:42:59,216
No, Billy was a good boy.

1415
01:42:59,299 --> 01:43:01,718
Billy was perfect.
You did a bang-up job, Mrs. Loomis.

1416
01:43:01,802 --> 01:43:04,930
It's not wise to patronize
a woman with a gun, Sidney.

1417
01:43:05,013 --> 01:43:08,725
Randy spoke poorly of Billy,
and I got a little knife happy.

1418
01:43:09,559 --> 01:43:11,144
I was a good mother.

1419
01:43:11,937 --> 01:43:14,272
You know what makes me sick?

1420
01:43:15,023 --> 01:43:17,776
I am sick to death of people saying
that it's all the parents' fault.

1421
01:43:17,859 --> 01:43:20,445
That it all starts with the family.
You wanna blame someone?

1422
01:43:20,529 --> 01:43:22,614
Why don't you blame your mother?

1423
01:43:23,490 --> 01:43:26,159
She's the one who stole my husband
and broke up my family.

1424
01:43:26,743 --> 01:43:29,454
And then you took my son!

1425
01:43:31,998 --> 01:43:34,418
You don't know what it is to be a mother.

1426
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,839
To raise a child and teach him...
and guide him—

1427
01:43:38,922 --> 01:43:40,465
And abandon him.

1428
01:43:41,591 --> 01:43:43,468
Isn't Mickey supposed to be dead?

1429
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,409
Oh, no!

1430
01:46:14,786 --> 01:46:16,288
Oh, no.

1431
01:46:18,081 --> 01:46:19,165
No.

1432
01:46:21,960 --> 01:46:23,879
Don't you fuckin' move!

1433
01:46:24,546 --> 01:46:27,340
- Goddamn it!
- Cotton.

1434
01:46:28,133 --> 01:46:30,760
Okay, okay, okay. Everybody slow down.

1435
01:46:30,844 --> 01:46:34,222
I have had a very, very bad day...

1436
01:46:34,306 --> 01:46:38,894
and I would like to know
exactly what the fuck is going on here.

1437
01:46:38,977 --> 01:46:41,688
- Sidney?
- Cotton, meet Billy Loomis's mother.

1438
01:46:41,771 --> 01:46:43,565
She's the killer.

1439
01:46:43,648 --> 01:46:44,983
What?

1440
01:46:48,778 --> 01:46:51,156
- And who's that?
- The other killer.

1441
01:46:51,239 --> 01:46:52,657
Mickey.

1442
01:46:53,783 --> 01:46:55,035
Okay.

1443
01:46:55,619 --> 01:46:57,662
- Look, Cotton—
- Shut up.

1444
01:46:58,747 --> 01:46:59,956
So—

1445
01:47:00,582 --> 01:47:02,250
- Hi.
- Hi.

1446
01:47:02,918 --> 01:47:05,545
You're not Debbie Salt, are you?

1447
01:47:05,629 --> 01:47:07,505
You're not with the <i>Post Telegraph.</i>

1448
01:47:09,007 --> 01:47:11,301
No, but I can still help you, Cotton.

1449
01:47:13,261 --> 01:47:15,889
You don't need her. Let me kill her!

1450
01:47:16,514 --> 01:47:20,101
As long as she's alive,
you're never gonna be the lead story.

1451
01:47:20,185 --> 01:47:22,395
That's what you really want,
isn't it, Cotton?

1452
01:47:22,479 --> 01:47:24,940
If you <i>really</i> wanna be in the spotlight...

1453
01:47:25,023 --> 01:47:27,609
just let me kill her... right now.

1454
01:47:28,401 --> 01:47:31,696
Then you're the only survivor.
You're the star!

1455
01:47:34,115 --> 01:47:36,910
She sent you to prison for a year!

1456
01:47:37,953 --> 01:47:40,330
Personally, I think it's rather poetic.

1457
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:51,675
No. No, Cotton. Don't you listen to her.

1458
01:47:55,178 --> 01:47:57,597
It's quite a predicament you're in, Sid.

1459
01:47:57,681 --> 01:48:00,558
- Cotton—
- She makes a good point.

1460
01:48:01,893 --> 01:48:04,604
Let me think about this.
Maybe you should too.

1461
01:48:05,730 --> 01:48:08,942
Bet you that Diane Sawyer interview's
lookin' real good right about now.

1462
01:48:25,375 --> 01:48:26,751
Consider it done.

1463
01:48:47,856 --> 01:48:48,940
Wow.

1464
01:48:49,774 --> 01:48:52,360
That... was intense.

1465
01:49:04,956 --> 01:49:06,875
Hey, Sidney—

1466
01:49:06,958 --> 01:49:10,837
I want you to know that I would never,
ever do anything to hurt you.

1467
01:49:11,421 --> 01:49:13,173
Cotton, give me the gun.

1468
01:49:16,885 --> 01:49:19,304
Yeah. Okay. Sure. Take it.

1469
01:49:21,681 --> 01:49:24,559
Sid, we should probably talk about
what exactly happened here.

1470
01:49:24,642 --> 01:49:27,479
Get our stories straight
for the press statement.

1471
01:49:28,063 --> 01:49:29,564
Oh, shit!

1472
01:49:30,190 --> 01:49:33,276
- Cotton.
- Could somebody get me outta here?

1473
01:49:33,359 --> 01:49:35,779
Gale. Are you all right?

1474
01:49:35,862 --> 01:49:37,781
I've been shot. Of course not.

1475
01:49:37,864 --> 01:49:40,366
- Help!
- Here. Give me your hand, Gale.

1476
01:49:40,450 --> 01:49:43,119
- Ow.
- Jesus, Gale, you scared the crap outta me.

1477
01:49:43,203 --> 01:49:45,663
- Isn't anybody else down there, is there?
- No.

1478
01:49:46,664 --> 01:49:48,750
So much for reporting from the trenches, huh?

1479
01:49:48,833 --> 01:49:50,585
Shut up, Cotton.

1480
01:49:51,252 --> 01:49:55,006
- How bad is it?
- Just bounced off my ribs.

1481
01:49:55,090 --> 01:49:57,467
Geez, Gale.
You got more lives than a cat.

1482
01:50:04,766 --> 01:50:06,684
Give me one of those.

1483
01:50:08,269 --> 01:50:10,355
Is she dead?

1484
01:50:10,438 --> 01:50:13,525
I don't know. They always come back.

1485
01:50:43,054 --> 01:50:45,014
Just in case.

1486
01:50:54,732 --> 01:50:56,651
- That about wraps it up, Chief.
- Okay, Frank.

1487
01:50:56,734 --> 01:50:59,320
Take it easy.
You got a couple of broken ribs there.

1488
01:50:59,404 --> 01:51:01,364
- Greg, I'm okay.
- Sure.

1489
01:51:04,117 --> 01:51:06,202
Hey, Gale. Are you all right?

1490
01:51:06,286 --> 01:51:07,328
Joel.

1491
01:51:07,412 --> 01:51:09,038
I'm back.

1492
01:51:09,122 --> 01:51:12,375
I was thinking maybe we could
get the scoop like in the old days.

1493
01:51:13,501 --> 01:51:17,005
You're Gale Weathers... at Windsor College.

1494
01:51:17,088 --> 01:51:19,132
We got a live one here!

1495
01:51:19,632 --> 01:51:21,134
Move it!

1496
01:51:22,260 --> 01:51:24,721
- Where's Gale?
- Got room in that one over there?

1497
01:51:24,804 --> 01:51:26,014
- Yeah.
- Dewey!

1498
01:51:26,097 --> 01:51:28,016
Watch your back! Watch your back!

1499
01:51:28,099 --> 01:51:29,475
- Go.
- Oh, God.

1500
01:51:29,559 --> 01:51:32,228
- Take it easy, buddy.
- I can't believe you're alive.

1501
01:51:33,271 --> 01:51:35,481
- Are you okay?
- Gale.

1502
01:51:36,065 --> 01:51:38,026
You hang in there.

1503
01:51:39,110 --> 01:51:42,197
He was lucky.
Knife went into some old scar tissue.

1504
01:51:42,280 --> 01:51:43,865
Saved his life.

1505
01:51:45,992 --> 01:51:47,619
Bye-bye.

1506
01:51:49,495 --> 01:51:51,456
I'm coming with you.

1507
01:51:57,212 --> 01:51:58,849
How do you feel?
Can you tell us what you saw?

1508
01:51:58,874 --> 01:52:00,381
Can you tell us what
happened in there?

1509
01:52:00,465 --> 01:52:02,634
Sidney, can you tell us
how it feels to be a hero?

1510
01:52:06,429 --> 01:52:07,931
Talk to Cotton.

1511
01:52:09,349 --> 01:52:12,644
He's the man you want to interview.
He's the hero.

1512
01:52:14,437 --> 01:52:15,813
Cotton!

1513
01:52:19,359 --> 01:52:21,861
- What went on in there? What happened?
- Is it true you're a hero?

1514
01:52:21,945 --> 01:52:23,446
What really happened inside there?

1515
01:52:24,906 --> 01:52:26,407
Any details at all?

1516
01:52:26,491 --> 01:52:27,992
- Details, please!
- Tell us what happened.

1517
01:52:28,076 --> 01:52:30,745
Look, guys. No one wants to give you
the story more than I do.

1518
01:52:30,828 --> 01:52:32,789
Unfortunately, there is a time and a place...

1519
01:52:32,872 --> 01:52:35,750
and indeed, a price for everything,
so feel free to call me.

1520
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:38,002
Come on, Cotton. Tell us something.

1521
01:52:38,086 --> 01:52:40,797
I'll tell you one thing.

1522
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:43,549
It'll make a hell of a movie. Thank you.
