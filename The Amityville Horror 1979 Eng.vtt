03:24.300 --> 03:28.220
Jesus christ, it gets worse all the time.
- This job doesn't get any better.

03:29.340 --> 03:31.700
All shot in their beds, execution style.

03:32.220 --> 03:34.020
Only the mother shot in the head.

03:35.540 --> 03:39.020
What time you make it?
- Give me a ballpark guess.

03:39.580 --> 03:41.300
3:00, 3:15 ...

03:41.900 --> 03:43.380
And that's pretty close.

03:44.460 --> 03:45.420
Thanks.

04:44.300 --> 04:45.900
How long have you been waiting?

04:46.020 --> 04:47.900
About half an hour?
- Just a couple of minutes.

04:50.020 --> 04:52.020
Over there. That's a little gardening hut.

04:53.380 --> 04:57.380
You mean that's included?
- Sure, it could be a guest house with a little fixing up.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.340
A guest house?
- Sure.

04:59.860 --> 05:00.740
Come on.

05:01.020 --> 05:02.220
Right up here.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.140
See how much property you have?
Isn't that lovely?

05:11.060 --> 05:12.340
Be careful. Don't trip.

05:15.100 --> 05:17.060
You'll see what a beauty this is.

05:22.580 --> 05:24.660
There's nothing like it on the market.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.460
Not at this price.

05:29.980 --> 05:32.020
Come in. Come on in.
- Thank you.

05:32.340 --> 05:34.180
Impressive, isn't it?

05:34.300 --> 05:36.940
Wow. I mean, that's what I call charming.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.420
Come on. I'll show you the living room.
- Oh, thank you.

05:41.540 --> 05:43.820
That's a wood-burning fireplace.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.700
Be nice on cold nights.

05:50.980 --> 05:52.260
That's the sunporch.

05:52.380 --> 05:53.660
Nice, isn't it?

05:54.140 --> 05:57.100
George, I don't think ...
- Be cool.

05:57.340 --> 05:58.820
Would you like to see the kitchen?

05:59.100 --> 06:00.580
Yes, thank you.

06:00.820 --> 06:02.220
This is the kitchen.

06:02.580 --> 06:08.020
Nice and spacious, isn't it? Really big.
Has all the original hardware and everything works.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.540
Is this your first house?

06:13.900 --> 06:15.420
We just got married.

06:16.740 --> 06:18.300
Shall we look at the upstairs?

06:19.100 --> 06:22.860
I like to refer to this as a fixer-upper that can be fun.

06:26.860 --> 06:28.540
We can start with this, huh?

06:29.860 --> 06:32.660
now, this is ... an extra room.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.300
This is the bathroom connecting with the next bedroom.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.340
This is the second bedroom.

06:53.300 --> 06:55.900
There's a nice view of the river from here.

06:58.100 --> 07:02.860
If you're planning on a big family,
there are three full bedrooms plus ...

07:03.020 --> 07:04.460
Two boys and a girl.

07:04.580 --> 07:05.780
Great kids.

07:08.980 --> 07:11.220
You are so bad. - What?
- Cut it out. - What?

07:21.260 --> 07:23.340
Next is the master bedroom.

07:37.580 --> 07:38.420
I love it.

07:39.780 --> 07:41.780
there's just one more floor.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.420
See anything you like ...

07:52.980 --> 07:54.620
we can include it in the price.

07:54.740 --> 07:56.540
Really?
- Sure.

08:04.260 --> 08:05.500
This can be another bedroom ...

08:05.620 --> 08:08.020
or a playroom. Whichever you prefer.

08:14.860 --> 08:18.980
I tell you what. I think maybe we'll wander around
on our own again, now that we got the layout.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.860
We can meet you downstairs.

08:22.340 --> 08:23.700
How'd that be?

08:23.820 --> 08:25.300
I ... I'll be in the kitchen.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.220
Take your time.

08:27.420 --> 08:28.620
We won't be long.

08:33.580 --> 08:34.539
What do you think?

08:35.500 --> 08:36.659
I love it.

08:38.780 --> 08:39.900
But honey ...

08:40.780 --> 08:42.740
$80,000?

08:46.500 --> 08:48.980
Well, it might as well be $800,000.

08:51.620 --> 08:52.460
Well ...

08:52.580 --> 08:53.740
Now listen ...

08:55.980 --> 08:57.660
The house is worth ...

08:57.980 --> 09:00.220
120,000 easy.

09:01.980 --> 09:07.100
And if I move my office into that little cottage out back,
that'll save that rent. And the boathouse ...

09:07.220 --> 09:11.060
means I won't have to shell out for mooring charges,
which they're raising by the way..

09:11.660 --> 09:13.100
You didn't tell me that.

09:13.260 --> 09:15.460
No, there was nothing to be done about it.

09:16.260 --> 09:17.700
I just wish that ...

09:18.420 --> 09:20.580
All those people hadn't died here.

09:21.900 --> 09:25.260
I mean. A guy ... kills his whole family?

09:25.580 --> 09:26.820
Doesn't that bother you?

09:27.220 --> 09:28.780
Oh yeah, sure, but ...

09:29.060 --> 09:31.060
houses don't have memories.

09:33.460 --> 09:34.500
I don't know.

09:35.740 --> 09:39.860
Well, I do. The house wouldn't even be for sale.
And if it was, we couldn't afford it ...

09:39.980 --> 09:41.260
if we had ...

09:41.380 --> 09:43.460
tuna casseroles for a year.

09:45.140 --> 09:48.180
Oh, you're gonna be very happy.
It's a wonderful house.

09:48.820 --> 09:51.380
I'm sure they'll accept your offer.
Don't worry about a thing.

09:51.500 --> 09:55.100
I'll handle the details.
Just ... go on and get ready to move.

10:53.340 --> 10:55.820
They're not getting too close to the river out there?

10:57.140 --> 11:00.780
Sounds like a regular daddy I hear over there.
- I might feel like one, if ...

11:00.900 --> 11:03.980
that's what they started calling me instead of ...
George.

11:04.220 --> 11:08.140
Which, I got to admit, is better than
all that "Mr. Lutz" crap they were giving me.

11:12.580 --> 11:14.020
What do you wanna do with this?

11:15.820 --> 11:17.780
Oh, I know, I know. Put it in the living room ...

11:17.900 --> 11:21.900
on that wall there beside the bookshelf.
And the light will come through the window. Look beautiful.

11:22.860 --> 11:23.980
You got it.

11:35.540 --> 11:37.100
Voila!

11:39.380 --> 11:41.260
Aw, shit. Come on.

11:54.020 --> 11:59.860
Oh, I'm tired of this damn sticky paper!
I wish I'd listened to my mother and gotten

12:00.100 --> 12:01.620
Nobody likes a quitter.

12:02.700 --> 12:04.140
But I got an idea.

12:06.220 --> 12:08.460
Get a couple of beers
and go outside and play?

12:10.900 --> 12:12.700
What are those monsters up to?

12:27.460 --> 12:28.380
Hello?

12:29.500 --> 12:30.980
Anybody home?

12:32.140 --> 12:33.140
Hello?

12:38.020 --> 12:39.260
George?

12:41.900 --> 12:43.220
Kathy?

12:43.460 --> 12:44.900
Anybody home?

12:52.620 --> 12:53.660
Hello?

13:50.140 --> 13:52.140
Come on Harry, get over here.

14:54.900 --> 14:56.500
God's peace in this house.

16:12.860 --> 16:14.900
<i>Get out.</i>

16:21.540 --> 16:23.180
<i>Get out!</i>

17:17.859 --> 17:19.099
Amy?

17:19.540 --> 17:21.420
Amy, honey, dinner's ready.

17:25.619 --> 17:26.859
Amy?

17:46.420 --> 17:48.020
Here ...
- No, I've got her.

17:48.140 --> 17:49.420
You and the boys start out.

17:49.540 --> 17:52.100
I'll take her upstairs and ...
put her to bed.

17:58.940 --> 18:00.340
She wasn't outside.

18:01.820 --> 18:03.100
Where was she?  whack.

18:04.100 --> 18:05.700
Up be getting in there and eat your hot dog.
Come on.

18:05.820 --> 18:06.660
Whack.

18:28.860 --> 18:30.660
Hello? - Hello.

18:31.460 --> 18:33.060
Hello, Kathy?

18:36.660 --> 18:38.500
Kathy, can you hear me?

18:39.300 --> 18:40.580
Kathy?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.660
Father Delaney. There's something very impor ...

18:46.100 --> 18:47.700
Hello? Hello?

19:28.060 --> 19:28.780
Who was that?

19:28.900 --> 19:30.260
on the phone?

19:30.660 --> 19:31.420
Yeah.

19:31.540 --> 19:34.340
Just a bunch of static.
A bad connection or something.

19:34.540 --> 19:37.020
I think ma bell's gone wacko again.

19:39.420 --> 19:43.860
Probably discover it was a collect call
from Japan or someplace when the next bill comes.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.740
Oh, did you make sure that Amy's got her doll with her?

19:47.540 --> 19:49.300
Yeah, she's sleeping with it.

19:50.100 --> 19:51.420
You hungry, honey?

19:53.100 --> 19:56.740
You mean, you don't want one of those
charbroiled hot dogs I did especially for you?

19:58.620 --> 20:00.340
No, I'm not hungry.

20:05.300 --> 20:07.140
Damn, it's cold in here.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.260
I felt cold a bit earlier, but I think I've warmed up now.

20:13.620 --> 20:16.100
It says 72. Feels like 32.

20:16.780 --> 20:17.940
Do you know what I think it is?

20:18.060 --> 20:21.940
I think there's a ... draft that comes up
from the basement through that door down there.

20:26.180 --> 20:28.540
This house is supposed to be well-insulated.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.540
They'll nickel-and-dime you to death.

20:31.020 --> 20:31.900
Huh?

21:21.620 --> 21:22.740
Matt?

21:24.060 --> 21:24.860
Are you all right?

21:24.980 --> 21:26.060
Yeah.

21:26.940 --> 21:28.260
Did you hurt yourself?

21:28.540 --> 21:29.420
No.

21:29.900 --> 21:31.420
Those stairs are tricky.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.460
Come on.

21:32.740 --> 21:34.220
I'll take you upstairs.

21:34.580 --> 21:36.980
We'll check this all out tomorrow, huh?

22:19.660 --> 22:21.860
I'm sorry, baby. I didn't mean to scare you.

22:24.380 --> 22:26.140
I look at you all the time.

22:26.860 --> 22:28.460
I can't get used to you.

22:33.180 --> 22:34.380
who loves you?

22:37.660 --> 22:38.820
I'm lucky.

22:40.180 --> 22:41.180
Come here.

22:41.340 --> 22:43.740
I just wanted to clean up first.

22:54.580 --> 22:56.700
I love the way you smell right now.

23:07.380 --> 23:08.860
I love you.

23:09.940 --> 23:11.620
I love you back.

23:19.820 --> 23:23.020
You make me feel like a kid in the backseat of a car.

23:31.620 --> 23:33.140
I want us to work.

23:33.580 --> 23:36.820
I want to be the best.
I don't want you to have any regrets.

23:38.260 --> 23:39.860
I love you, Kathy.

24:35.580 --> 24:37.780
I wanna go home.

24:39.180 --> 24:45.060
Mommy, I wanna go home.
- Honey, come on. What's the trouble?

24:46.500 --> 24:48.700
This is our home. Don't you know that?

24:50.580 --> 24:52.100
Here we go.

24:54.380 --> 24:56.420
There you go, sweetie.

24:56.780 --> 24:58.900
What's the matter? Mean dreams?

25:02.260 --> 25:03.620
Sleep tight.

25:42.540 --> 25:44.420
It's not so easy, is it?

25:46.100 --> 25:47.300
Well ...

25:47.460 --> 25:51.780
I guess people have had to deal with this ever
since Adam and Eve got kicked out of the garden.

25:54.180 --> 25:55.940
I'll just have to learn to live with it.

26:01.140 --> 26:02.260
Thank you.

27:52.300 --> 27:54.380
You're one hell of a watchdog here.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.140
Come on, boy.

27:59.860 --> 28:00.700
Come on.

28:20.980 --> 28:23.380
What do you say, Harry?
It looks okay, huh?

29:31.980 --> 29:33.020
George.

30:03.740 --> 30:04.980
Don't ever do that.

30:05.900 --> 30:08.180
Not to a man with an axe in his hand.

30:08.500 --> 30:10.580
I just thought maybe I could get a little help.

30:12.380 --> 30:13.820
Look what you made me do.

30:13.940 --> 30:15.260
I made you do?

30:15.380 --> 30:18.300
There's a week's worth of groceries
rolling down the walk.

30:18.540 --> 30:20.420
Wait a minute till I finish this up.

30:21.060 --> 30:25.500
George, "finish"? You have got enough wood here
to heat the whole south shore!

30:38.860 --> 30:39.780
You take this.

30:40.740 --> 30:41.980
I'll get the rest.

30:42.180 --> 30:43.140
I love you.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.260
Broke a bulb.

30:54.380 --> 30:59.500
Hey, who drinks this fancy kind of tea around here?
- Oh, that's for aunt Helena.

31:00.700 --> 31:01.740
Oh, give me a break.
-

31:01.860 --> 31:05.500
Oh, come on, George, be nice.
This is a big event in my family.

31:05.820 --> 31:09.380
We've always been a bunch of renters.
This is the first time anyone's bought a house.

31:09.900 --> 31:12.500
Damn regimental inspection and we're not ready.

32:05.780 --> 32:07.660
Sweetie pie, you scared me.

32:07.780 --> 32:08.620
What do you want?

32:08.980 --> 32:11.420
My friend Jody wants to play upstairs.

32:11.580 --> 32:13.660
Huh, Jody?
See?

32:14.180 --> 32:16.420
Well, you and Jody go on up and enjoy yourself.

32:16.620 --> 32:18.980
And does your friend Jody like sugar cookies too?

32:20.380 --> 32:22.780
I don't think so.
- No?

32:24.540 --> 32:25.780
Off you go.

32:41.900 --> 32:46.740
<i>Hello, this is Kathy Lutz.</i>
<i>Could I speak with father Delaney, please?</i>

32:46.860 --> 32:48.940
The father's not feeling very well today.

32:49.180 --> 32:50.740
He's asleep right now.

32:51.620 --> 32:53.740
This is father Bolen. May I help you anyway?

32:53.860 --> 32:55.780
Oh, father Bolen, um ...

32:56.260 --> 32:59.100
He was supposed to come by
and bless the house yesterday, but ...

32:59.220 --> 33:03.860
it can wait till he feels better. I hope he's not too sick.
- Oh, I think it's just one of those flu things.

33:04.420 --> 33:05.660
But Mrs. Lutz ...

33:05.940 --> 33:07.980
the father was at your house yesterday.

33:08.220 --> 33:10.420
We were expecting him, but he never showed up.

33:10.540 --> 33:12.460
Well, I know he left to go there.

33:12.580 --> 33:14.860
<i>He didn't come. We waited all day.</i>

33:15.380 --> 33:17.140
Must have been some kind of mix-up.

33:17.300 --> 33:22.540
<i>Oh, well, no big deal. Just tell him</i>
hi and ... and that we hope he's feeling better.

33:22.660 --> 33:23.540
I sure will.

33:23.660 --> 33:24.980
Thank you for calling.

33:56.620 --> 33:58.580
I'll go check Amy's bathroom.

34:00.220 --> 34:02.820
Oh, boy, it's stink!

34:17.860 --> 34:19.380
Kathy!

34:20.179 --> 34:23.659
Go downstairs and let your aunt Helena in.
And don't tell her anything about this, ok.

34:23.780 --> 34:28.219
Do we have to? - She's always pinching!
- Yes, you have to go now! - Come on. - Go on.

34:28.980 --> 34:30.260
And be polite.

34:35.900 --> 34:39.060
Well, hello, Matthew ...

34:39.620 --> 34:42.780
and Gregory and Harry.

34:42.900 --> 34:46.100
Where's your mother, dear?
- She said she'll be down in a minute.

35:22.180 --> 35:23.420
Aunt Helena?

35:23.540 --> 35:24.580
Kathleen.
- What?

35:24.700 --> 35:30.500
I'm sorry. I ... I must have set it too near the edge.
I ... I have to go.

35:30.620 --> 35:31.500
I don't understand.

35:31.620 --> 35:34.020
I don't feel well at all.
- Look ...

35:34.460 --> 35:38.460
I bought your favorite tea and I'll make you a cup.
- I have to go.

35:38.580 --> 35:42.340
I really feel terrible.
- If you just rested a while, you'd feel a lot ... - I can't stay!

35:42.460 --> 35:47.860
Please, stay. - No, I cannot stay. I don't feel well. I don't.
- You can just rest and ...

35:48.260 --> 35:52.820
I can't stay. Forgive me.
- George, please make her st ...

37:30.340 --> 37:31.340
Babe ...

37:41.540 --> 37:43.580
Aren't you gonna come to bed?
- In a minute.

37:44.820 --> 37:46.260
The fire went out.

37:47.580 --> 37:48.980
Are you still cold?

37:54.220 --> 37:56.140
Hope you're not coming down with something.

37:59.100 --> 38:00.460
I'll be all right.

38:01.660 --> 38:04.140
I gotta stay healthy for your brother's wedding.

38:13.980 --> 38:15.780
Your hair's getting long.

38:19.900 --> 38:22.340
You know what? Maybe you should sleep in tomorrow.

38:23.660 --> 38:25.100
I got work to do.

38:25.620 --> 38:28.260
I don't want to be up to my ass in boxes forever.

38:39.260 --> 38:40.420
I'm sorry.

38:43.700 --> 38:45.580
I don't know what the hell's the matter with me.

38:46.780 --> 38:50.420
Silly, this happens all the time.
- Not to me, it doesn't.

38:50.580 --> 38:53.660
Hey, stop pushing.
You don't have to prove anything to me.

39:09.620 --> 39:11.060
Turn out the light.

39:12.260 --> 39:13.780
Turn out the light.

39:22.060 --> 39:23.300
I love you.

39:24.140 --> 39:25.780
I love you back.

39:49.540 --> 39:51.500
She was shot in the head!

39:56.340 --> 39:57.220
No.

39:59.100 --> 40:00.260
You all right?

40:28.260 --> 40:29.700
Tell me something, father.

40:30.140 --> 40:31.020
What?

40:32.380 --> 40:34.140
Why couldn't this wait till tomorrow?

40:35.220 --> 40:36.740
I don't know. I ...

40:37.860 --> 40:40.940
All I know is I have to get back to that house.,That's ...

40:43.820 --> 40:45.140
Are you feeling all right, father?

40:45.260 --> 40:47.300
I'm fine, fine, fine.

40:53.820 --> 40:54.620
Father!

40:55.140 --> 40:57.220
What's the matter?
- Something wrong with the steering wheel!

41:00.220 --> 41:01.500
I can't move the wheel!

41:13.980 --> 41:15.420
What's wrong with this thing?

41:50.580 --> 41:52.580
Harry, be quiet!

41:53.380 --> 41:54.940
Be quiet!

42:02.780 --> 42:03.820
Come on.

42:16.100 --> 42:17.900
Kathy!

42:19.380 --> 42:26.060
Will you check this for me, please? It's got to come to
1,500 bucks for the caterer. The sucker wants cash.

42:26.180 --> 42:28.540
You've counted it about a thousand times.

42:34.780 --> 42:36.460
You sure do look terrific.

42:45.740 --> 42:48.180
You're not gonna start to cry already?

42:51.980 --> 42:56.020
It's just that, yesterday.
I was riding you around on the back of my bike ...

42:56.380 --> 42:58.140
and now you're getting married.

42:58.860 --> 43:00.340
Sure I am.

43:04.540 --> 43:07.140
I'm just real happy for you. That's all, honey.

43:14.660 --> 43:16.540
Hey, there he is.

43:18.060 --> 43:21.420
George, you look terrible.
- So, she keeps telling me.

43:21.540 --> 43:25.340
Oh, it's just some kind of flu virus going around.
Amy's got it too. It's nothing.

43:25.460 --> 43:26.180
Listen ...

43:26.300 --> 43:30.260
if you're not up to it, I'd understand.
- Hey, I'm your best man.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.340
Come on.

43:31.460 --> 43:32.380
Let's go.

43:32.940 --> 43:36.820
Okay.
- Mrs. Lutz, am I supposed to give Amy an aspirin?

43:37.420 --> 43:39.820
Just give her one before bed, okay?

43:41.340 --> 43:42.580
You gonna be okay?

43:43.180 --> 43:44.540
I don't know.

43:48.180 --> 43:49.140
What's the matter?

43:49.900 --> 43:50.860
The money.

43:51.420 --> 43:52.580
What money?

43:53.140 --> 43:56.500
The money for the caterer. Fifteen hundred dollars!
I put it in ... I put it in this pocket.

43:56.620 --> 43:59.300
Well, it must have fallen out. Come on, now.
- Well, it's not here.

44:00.780 --> 44:02.420
I'll look under here.

44:04.900 --> 44:06.420
Have you checked your pants?

44:09.780 --> 44:12.820
Now calm down, Jimmy. Calm down.
It can't have gotten up and walked away.

44:12.940 --> 44:14.620
If you had it here, it's got to be here.

44:14.740 --> 44:15.940
What am I gonna do?

44:17.100 --> 44:19.740
Oh, I can't believe it! I can't believe it!

44:22.700 --> 44:24.900
Will you get those kids off that horn?!

44:25.020 --> 44:26.700
Jimmy ...
George ...

44:27.140 --> 44:29.340
we have to go. We're getting very late.
- George, what am I gonna do?

44:33.060 --> 44:34.780
It's got to be here someplace.

44:34.940 --> 44:36.500
We'll just look for it when we get home.

44:36.620 --> 44:38.020
What about the caterer?

44:40.980 --> 44:42.380
I'll take care of him.

44:42.540 --> 44:43.820
I'll write him a check.

44:44.100 --> 44:45.420
Oh, sweetie.

44:46.420 --> 44:47.300
Okay?

44:48.380 --> 44:49.700
I'll get the kids.

45:08.740 --> 45:10.700
It's freezing in here.

45:14.340 --> 45:15.580
It's time for bed, Amy.

45:15.700 --> 45:20.940
I've got to give you an aspirin.
- I don't wanna go to bed. I wanna play with Jody.

45:21.060 --> 45:24.420
And your mom said Ihad to put you to bed early,
because you've been sick.

45:24.540 --> 45:26.340
Now, don't smart off to me.

45:26.460 --> 45:27.700
I wasn't sick.

45:27.820 --> 45:30.180
I just didn't like meat loaf.

45:30.300 --> 45:32.220
Let's get you into your pajamas.

45:52.260 --> 45:53.300
Amy?

45:53.460 --> 45:54.740
Open the door.

46:00.140 --> 46:01.260
Amy ...

46:01.700 --> 46:04.060
I'm in the closet. Open the door.

46:08.300 --> 46:09.980
Amy, I mean it!

46:16.540 --> 46:17.660
Amy?

46:17.780 --> 46:19.780
Come to the door. Open it!

46:22.260 --> 46:25.540
Amy, for christ's sake open the door!

46:26.220 --> 46:27.220
Amy!?

46:27.340 --> 46:28.460
Amy!

46:33.980 --> 46:37.900
Amy! Open the door! Amy!

46:38.860 --> 46:39.700
Open ...

46:41.980 --> 46:44.220
Amy! Open the door!

46:48.340 --> 46:49.620
Amy!

46:50.060 --> 46:52.500
Amy, open the door!

46:53.700 --> 46:54.940
Amy?

46:55.340 --> 46:58.060
For christ's sake open the door!

46:58.260 --> 47:01.180
Amy!

47:22.700 --> 47:23.860
How are you?

47:24.780 --> 47:29.100
Are you feeling better? - Fine. Just fine.
- Good, good. - I want to apologize for the other day.

47:29.220 --> 47:34.860
I don't know what happened. I hadn't gone
a half a block from your house and I was violently ill.

47:34.980 --> 47:40.420
I think there's a ... virus or something going around.
- Yeah? - Father Delaney's got something

47:40.660 --> 47:42.860
I don't know what's the matter with George.
- Oh.

47:44.300 --> 47:45.340
Listen ...

47:45.500 --> 47:47.220
I'll talk to you later, okay?

47:59.500 --> 48:01.220
I'm gonna write you a check.

48:01.940 --> 48:07.020
Look, the deal was cash, you know? Cash.
- The cash is lost. you gotta take a check.

48:07.140 --> 48:08.500
I don't like checks.

48:08.620 --> 48:10.540
Let me tell you something about checks.

48:10.660 --> 48:13.460
Checks get canceled. Checks bounce.

48:13.620 --> 48:15.380
Checks is not cash.

48:15.620 --> 48:17.340
Cash is cash.

48:17.940 --> 48:19.340
Now you listen to me, pal.

48:20.060 --> 48:21.660
I don't like lectures.

48:22.020 --> 48:24.780
And I don't like being hassled in the men's room.

48:24.900 --> 48:26.620
I'm gonna write you a check.

48:27.540 --> 48:31.340
Either that's good enough for you
or either you're eat your own goddamn food.

48:33.780 --> 48:35.060
Look at this.

48:35.180 --> 48:37.860
I want cash and they're giving me a checks.

48:39.820 --> 48:41.220
Are you all right, honey?

48:41.500 --> 48:43.500
I said, I got to make it through the reception.

48:44.500 --> 48:48.100
Let's get the kids and split, huh?
- Okay. I'll get the kids, you take it easy.

49:20.380 --> 49:21.820
Matt, get over there.

49:27.460 --> 49:30.020
Now Matt. Right upstairs and right to bed. Come on.
- Why?

49:30.140 --> 49:35.660
Upstairs and right to bed.- I'm not even tired.
- You are so tired. - I am not!

49:36.060 --> 49:37.620
Hey ... cut that out.

49:37.860 --> 49:39.940
Come on. I'll bring you up some milk and cookies.

49:40.700 --> 49:42.700
Let me out.

49:43.900 --> 49:45.100
Let me out.

49:46.420 --> 49:49.940
Let me out.
- Amy? Amy, are you okay?

49:52.940 --> 49:53.860
Jackie?

49:54.540 --> 49:55.940
Oh, my god!

49:56.060 --> 49:57.860
I ... I ... - What happened?
- I couldn't get out.

49:57.980 --> 50:02.260
The ... the door closed and it locked
and I couldn't get out.

50:02.380 --> 50:03.620
It wouldn't open.

50:03.740 --> 50:04.660
Take a look.

50:04.780 --> 50:05.940
Look. See?

50:08.900 --> 50:10.780
It wouldn't open!

50:11.540 --> 50:14.740
Why didn't you open the door?
Why didn't you answer me?

50:15.380 --> 50:17.060
Why didn't you unlock the door?

50:17.180 --> 50:18.500
You heard Jackie knocking.

50:18.620 --> 50:20.460
Jody wouldn't let me.

50:20.860 --> 50:22.340
Jody? Who's Jody?

50:22.500 --> 50:25.500
She's my friend. And she comes to play with me.

50:25.980 --> 50:28.940
Jesus Christ, what the hell
are we standing here listening to?

50:29.100 --> 50:31.100
And weren't you told to go to bed?

50:31.740 --> 50:33.180
Go on!
Get out of here!

50:36.260 --> 50:38.940
These kids of yours need some goddamn discipline.

50:42.820 --> 50:44.780
Ok, let me see.
Let me go get something for them.

50:44.900 --> 50:46.820
George yelled at me.

50:46.940 --> 50:48.700
You should have opened the door!

50:50.180 --> 50:52.820
Jody doesn't like George.

51:34.700 --> 51:37.740
Where the hell is it?!

51:41.380 --> 51:44.540
There's an explanation for all of it.

51:44.900 --> 51:47.460
We're not in the habit of blaming satan
for every phenomenon.

51:47.580 --> 51:48.700
Neither am I, father.

51:48.820 --> 51:49.620
Well ...

51:50.060 --> 51:51.260
for a marianist ...

51:51.380 --> 51:53.380
who thought Vatican too didn't go far enough.

51:53.500 --> 51:55.980
Don't you think you sound a little medieval?

51:58.900 --> 52:00.940
My being a marianist has nothing to do with it.

52:01.540 --> 52:06.580
I happened to check into the murders.
And I checked into the 20-year-old boy,

52:06.700 --> 52:07.980
And when he was at trial ...

52:08.100 --> 52:10.620
he testified that he heard voices in the house!
He heard ...

52:10.740 --> 52:13.740
voices in the house.
And the voices told him to do it!

52:13.860 --> 52:16.300
Now, I was in the house and I heard the voices too!

52:16.420 --> 52:20.860
And I also felt a presence in the house!
I'm telling you, there was a presence in that house!

52:21.180 --> 52:24.220
Half the killers in this country say the same thing.

52:24.540 --> 52:25.540
"The voices."

52:25.700 --> 52:30.660
"The voices told me to do it."
- But I heard them, father! I heard voices!

52:30.900 --> 52:33.860
Oh, then explain this!
Explain my hand, if you can do that!

52:33.980 --> 52:34.540
Go on!

52:34.660 --> 52:36.940
Explain how the car went out of control!
Go on. Father Bolen was with me. You tell him!

52:39.860 --> 52:40.460
Well ...

52:40.580 --> 52:44.020
the wheel locked and then then ...
- "The wheel locked".

52:44.820 --> 52:46.940
How about a mechanical defect?

52:47.060 --> 52:49.740
I'd blame Detroit a lot faster than the devil.

52:50.220 --> 52:52.940
Seems like every month there's some kind of recall.

52:57.300 --> 52:58.380
I see ...

53:00.140 --> 53:01.860
We're just gonna walk away from it.

53:02.820 --> 53:05.180
Well, has that become the fashion now, to cover up?

53:05.460 --> 53:07.060
Nothing to walk away from.

53:08.220 --> 53:09.780
Well, I think it's nonsense.

53:09.900 --> 53:13.660
There's nothing to cover up.
- I think it's bureaucratical bullshit!

53:15.020 --> 53:16.420
What do you think I am?!

53:18.580 --> 53:20.100
I am not some ...

53:20.220 --> 53:22.500
pink ...
cheeked seminarian ...

53:22.620 --> 53:25.140
who doesn't know the difference
between the supernatural ...

53:25.260 --> 53:29.940
and a bad clam! I am a trained psychotherapist!
I went into that house!

53:30.060 --> 53:31.700
And what I saw there was real!

53:31.820 --> 53:35.980
What I felt there was real!
And what I heard there WAS REAL!

53:36.140 --> 53:40.380
Now, gentlemen, I have a family
in my parish that's at great risk!

53:40.500 --> 53:42.540
They are facing real danger.

53:44.460 --> 53:47.660
Who the hell do you think you are?!

53:47.780 --> 53:52.220
You think your secular education
gives you the right to question the church?!

53:53.420 --> 53:54.620
Sit down!!

53:56.540 --> 53:57.620
Sit!

54:09.900 --> 54:15.300
Now, you haven't told us one thing
that can't be written off as simple hysteria.

54:16.300 --> 54:20.700
Even psychotherapists lose touch with reality sometimes.

54:21.420 --> 54:24.220
Your education doesn't give you any immunity.

54:27.020 --> 54:30.100
Father Nuncio and I have seen our share of phenomena,

54:30.220 --> 54:34.460
And never once did any of them turn out to be satanist!

54:39.100 --> 54:41.660
Let's understand each other, father.

54:44.660 --> 54:45.860
to me ...

54:46.660 --> 54:47.980
The church ...

54:48.940 --> 54:50.860
it's my home.

54:51.420 --> 54:52.420
The church ...

54:52.940 --> 54:55.380
is my strength.

55:02.260 --> 55:04.220
And I need her now.

55:04.940 --> 55:06.260
And that family ...

55:06.660 --> 55:08.220
needs her ...

55:08.900 --> 55:10.260
now.

55:15.900 --> 55:16.900
Frank? ...

55:17.700 --> 55:20.780
How long has it been since you've seen your family?

55:25.620 --> 55:26.580
What do you mean?

55:27.220 --> 55:29.620
We think you should take a vacation.

55:34.060 --> 55:35.140
Good morning, father.

55:36.660 --> 55:37.780
Good day, father.

55:39.220 --> 55:41.180
You could do a haircut and shave.

56:21.660 --> 56:23.580
What do you think?
- Very uptown.

56:23.700 --> 56:25.180
I thought you guys had a small business.

56:25.300 --> 56:28.260
Believe me, we do. Getting smaller all the time.

56:30.020 --> 56:30.940
What's the matter?

56:34.900 --> 56:36.540
I don't want to go any closer.

56:37.300 --> 56:38.220
Carolyn ...

56:38.740 --> 56:40.060
What are you talking about?

56:42.420 --> 56:43.780
It gives me the creeps.

57:04.740 --> 57:05.900
Hiya, George.

57:06.060 --> 57:07.180
How's it going?

57:10.780 --> 57:11.940
Listen, I ...

57:12.580 --> 57:15.860
I wouldn't have come out and bothered you,
but your line's always busy.

57:15.980 --> 57:17.620
Nobody's seen you for days.

57:19.740 --> 57:22.300
You haven't even been in to sign the payroll checks.

57:23.340 --> 57:25.500
I did us both a favor and brought them along.

57:25.780 --> 57:26.580
Here.

57:27.220 --> 57:28.540
Guess what day is this.

57:28.660 --> 57:29.780
Thursday.

57:31.700 --> 57:33.020
Thursday?

57:34.780 --> 57:35.740
Thursday.

57:37.860 --> 57:40.660
I promised the men I'd hand deliver these.

57:41.140 --> 57:42.820
Should have been paid yesterday.

57:45.580 --> 57:49.260
Some caterer's been screaming.
You wrote him a personal check that bounced?

57:52.020 --> 57:55.620
I should have covered that.
- And some guy from the IRS has been calling.

57:55.740 --> 57:57.660
Don't you have any good news?

58:02.100 --> 58:03.500
Yeah, I ...

58:04.700 --> 58:06.860
I brought you the spotlight for your boat.

58:12.980 --> 58:13.740
Come on.

58:13.860 --> 58:15.340
I'll put it on for you.

58:18.460 --> 58:19.300
Come on.

58:34.300 --> 58:36.900
You girls think I don't know what you're up to?

58:37.020 --> 58:39.060
Well ... I do.

58:39.260 --> 58:44.060
If I ever catch you again, you're gonna be
in big trouble.

58:44.300 --> 58:45.620
You girls hear me?
janet,

58:45.860 --> 58:46.740
Janet?

58:46.860 --> 58:48.220
Are you listening?

58:48.420 --> 58:50.820
Now, don't be a smart-ass.

58:55.020 --> 58:57.700
You quit that.
Stop teasing me.

59:00.300 --> 59:01.140
Hey ...

59:01.780 --> 59:04.220
what are you two rascals doing in my room, huh?

59:12.420 --> 59:14.140
Oh, my god! Stucked!

59:21.820 --> 59:24.340
the goddamn thing
feels like it's nailed shut!

59:26.500 --> 59:27.260
Push!

59:54.700 --> 59:56.500
Hold it up. Don't ... don't let it drop.

59:56.620 --> 59:58.100
I'll drive, honey.

59:58.260 --> 59:59.900
Amazing.
- What?

01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.900
Not one broken bone.

01:00:12.340 --> 01:00:13.820
george, are you awake?

01:00:18.340 --> 01:00:21.900
Isn't it kind of strange none of the bones
were broken in Greg's hand?

01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.500
George, I have to talk to you.

01:02:45.540 --> 01:02:48.780
What was that?
- I don't know. you stay up here. - Like hell.

01:02:57.300 --> 01:02:58.140
Wait.

01:02:58.380 --> 01:02:59.260
Wait.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.380
Goddamnit, don't sneak up on me!

01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:17.700
You call the police. I'm gonna go check on something.

01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:19.420
It's okay, sweetie.

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:16.740
Hi, sarge. What brings you out?

01:04:16.860 --> 01:04:18.220
Insomnia.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:27.180
What do you got?

01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:29.060
Beats the hell out of me?

01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:47.980
What do you got?

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:50.780
This is Mrs. Lutz, sergeant.
- Mrs. Lutz.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.260
And a ... George Lutz.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:04.020
Is that l-u-t-z?

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:07.380
No "e."
- The basement door is the same as the front.

01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.260
Well, where's the basement?

01:05:11.380 --> 01:05:12.820
Come on, I'll show you.

01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:36.180
Hey, who let you in?

01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:38.940
What are you doing there, boy?

01:05:44.460 --> 01:05:45.940
No broken windows.

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.620
How long you been living here?

01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.620
A couple of weeks.

01:05:54.380 --> 01:05:56.980
Are you related to the family that was here before?

01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.660
You look a lot like them. The kid had the same ...

01:06:04.260 --> 01:06:05.820
Harry, knock it off!

01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.500
Have you had any trouble with vandals or trespassers?

01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:20.380
What's that supposed to mean?

01:06:20.620 --> 01:06:21.420
Well ...

01:06:22.620 --> 01:06:26.380
You've got a door that was broken
outward, Mr. Lutz from the inside.

01:06:27.860 --> 01:06:29.300
Burglars break in.

01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:31.500
You've got a front door, that's broken out.

01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:33.780
Let me tell you something.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:36.820
Somebody broke into my house.
They heard me coming ...

01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:38.500
and they took off.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:41.660
Okay. Then who broke the basement door?

01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:44.620
Oh, maybe they came in through the cellar and ...

01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:47.220
and ran out the front door.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.780
No. I checked all the windows down there. None broken.

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:52.820
You think it was faster to break it down
than to open it? Huh?

01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:02.540
There'll be a tighter watch on your house.

01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:05.740
And you call us if anything happens, okay?

01:07:07.460 --> 01:07:08.340
Good night.

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:10.140
Good night.

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:11.660
Night.

01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:10.220
Why's all going wrong?

01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:14.180
we have to do something.

01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.020
Jody says everything's gonna get better.

01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.380
What does Jody look like, huh?

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:44.700
I mean, uh ...

01:08:44.819 --> 01:08:46.140
Is Jody ...

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:48.979
big girl or thin or fat?

01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:51.100
She's nice.

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.460
She tells me things too.
- Yeah? Like what does she tell you?

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:59.979
She tells me about the little boy,
who used to live in my room.

01:09:00.100 --> 01:09:01.180
He got hurt ...

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:02.899
and he died.

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.779
And what else does Jody tell you?

01:09:05.899 --> 01:09:09.100
She says she wants me to live here forever and ever.

01:09:09.220 --> 01:09:11.420
So we can all play together.

01:09:32.899 --> 01:09:33.979
Goodbye, sweeties.

01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:36.180
Be home by 3:30, okay?

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.660
Be careful.

01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:52.220
Oh, answer.

01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.060
Please, answer.

01:11:19.500 --> 01:11:20.500
Hello.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:22.340
Father, this is Kathy Lutz ...

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:24.860
and I have to talk to you.

01:11:25.300 --> 01:11:26.420
Kathy ...

01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:29.500
listen to what I'm telling you.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:31.900
Father?

01:11:32.820 --> 01:11:34.220
Father!

01:11:37.700 --> 01:11:39.060
Father!

01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:54.140
O, lord, hear my prayer ...

01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.220
and hasten to answer me.

01:12:38.540 --> 01:12:39.460
Hello.

01:12:40.300 --> 01:12:43.620
Everybody wanted to come over though.
To welcome you to the neighborhood.

01:12:45.980 --> 01:12:47.300
It's all right, isn't it?

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.980
Just a minute, please.

01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:57.220
Hello.

01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.700
Hello?!

01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:48.060
George ...

01:13:49.460 --> 01:13:50.500
Thanks for coming.

01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:52.740
I thought I might be stood up.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:56.380
Look, don't give me any crap.
I don't have time for it. - George ...

01:13:56.740 --> 01:13:59.060
Relax, will you? I just want to buy you a drink.

01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.500
A couple of beers, please?
- Gotcha.

01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:06.580
George?

01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.580
Are you all right?

01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:09.820
I mean, you look terrible.

01:14:09.940 --> 01:14:11.300
Here you are, pal.

01:14:12.780 --> 01:14:14.500
Jesus, I'm sorry.

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:16.620
You look just like that kid.

01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:19.340
You know, he was sitting right in that seat
where you are when he was arrested.

01:14:19.460 --> 01:14:20.980
What the hell
are you talking about?

01:14:21.540 --> 01:14:25.100
The kid last year that killed his family.
You know the house down by the river.

01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:25.700
Hey ...

01:14:25.860 --> 01:14:27.220
You're the spitting image.
so?

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:28.380
So?

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:29.460
So, I'll ...

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:30.860
bring you another brew.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:32.780
No offense, huh?

01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:38.140
Look, I gotta get out of here. I'll talk to you later.
- No, George now.

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:39.460
We gotta talk now.

01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:42.940
The business is falling apart. People are calling.
Bills have to be paid.

01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:47.660
I know you're busy unpacking, but life goes on.
- Don't push me, Jeff. I'm warning you.

01:14:47.780 --> 01:14:48.740
You're warning me.

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:50.780
Give me a break, wiil you? Talk to me!

01:14:54.540 --> 01:14:57.420
I knew this would happen.
I told you, you were taking on too much.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:02.580
Just drop it, Jeff!
- You marry a dame with three kids.

01:15:02.700 --> 01:15:06.580
You change your religion
and you forget about business, great. Really great.

01:15:13.620 --> 01:15:14.660
Okay.

01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:16.940
Now can we talk?

01:15:19.740 --> 01:15:21.180
Christ, man, I'm sorry.

01:15:21.460 --> 01:15:23.420
I don't know what I was thinking, huh?

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:24.900
Okay.

01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.140
All right.

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:31.300
* Jesus loves me, this I know *

01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:35.740
* For the bible tells me so *

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:40.340
* Little ones to him belong *

01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:45.660
* They are weak, but he is strong *

01:15:45.780 --> 01:15:49.580
* Yes ...
Jesus loves me *

01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:53.580
* Yes ...
Jesus loves me *

01:15:53.700 --> 01:15:57.380
* Yes ...
Jesus loves me *

01:15:57.500 --> 01:15:59.980
* The bible *

01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:03.100
Who you singing to, princess?

01:16:03.220 --> 01:16:05.060
You scared Jody.

01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:06.980
Jody?

01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.140
Look, there's no one here.  You see?

01:16:10.260 --> 01:16:11.660
You scared her.

01:16:11.780 --> 01:16:13.820
She went out the window.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:16.060
She went out the window?

01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:19.660
Well, I ... I better check and make sure
she's not still there, huh?

01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:32.380
The house ...

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.020
is doing things.

01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:36.660
Windows open by themselves.

01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:40.140
Rooms full of flies at the wrong time of year.

01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:42.300
You saw what happened to Greg's hand.

01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:44.540
It's crazy.

01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:46.420
And a ...

01:16:46.540 --> 01:16:49.460
last night the front door was ripped off its hinges.

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:51.140
From the inside.

01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:53.300
Of course.

01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:55.500
It's right here; its history.

01:16:55.940 --> 01:16:57.540
John Ketchum.

01:16:57.740 --> 01:16:58.580
So?

01:16:58.780 --> 01:16:59.740
Listen ...

01:16:59.860 --> 01:17:02.740
They ran him out of Salem for being a witch.

01:17:04.740 --> 01:17:07.020
And he built his house exactly where you're living.

01:17:08.780 --> 01:17:11.380
You're living on some sort of special ground.

01:17:12.700 --> 01:17:14.260
Devil worship.

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:15.660
Death.

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:18.340
Sacrifice.

01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:20.900
George ...

01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:23.660
there's one simple rule.

01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:27.980
Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
It can only change forms.

01:17:28.100 --> 01:17:32.300
Carolyne, will you get a grip on yourself?
You sound like some kind of psycho weirdo.

01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.180
Come on, Jeffrey.

01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:36.820
Don't be such a big hard-core rationalist.

01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:39.620
You know, everything in life
cannot be explained by a slide rule.

01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:42.980
Oh, thank you very much for your cosmic views.
Now do me a favor.

01:17:43.100 --> 01:17:44.180
Shut up!

01:17:49.660 --> 01:17:51.300
Can I make a rational suggestion?

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:52.420
Please?

01:17:54.940 --> 01:17:56.020
Sure, man.

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:57.980
Anything.

01:17:59.780 --> 01:18:00.820
Go home ...

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:02.500
Get cleaned up.

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.780
Take Kathy out to dinner.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.180
Carolyn and I will baby-sit the kids.

01:18:07.940 --> 01:18:12.220
You've got to get away from it, George.
Even if it's for a couple of hours.

01:18:13.060 --> 01:18:14.540
We'll add it all up.

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:16.700
We'll talk this thing through.

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:24.220
Okay.

01:18:25.620 --> 01:18:26.980
Let's go home.

01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:45.140
Look, I'll go in and talk to Kathy
and you all come in a couple of minutes.

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:52.500
Hey ...

01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:53.540
Hey.

01:18:53.780 --> 01:18:54.620
Hey!

01:18:56.060 --> 01:18:57.740
He told us to wait out here.

01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:59.340
Jeff ...

01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:02.460
I've got to see it for myself.

01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:05.580
I thought that place give you the creeps.
- What?

01:19:09.300 --> 01:19:11.340
Are those vibes ever strong.

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:14.500
It really pulls on you.

01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:19.260
I've got to see the basement.
That's where it's coming from.

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:22.580
I'm very sensitive about these things.

01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:25.500
And I know about them.

01:19:29.380 --> 01:19:31.260
Come on. Knock it off, will you?

01:19:33.780 --> 01:19:36.340
What I saw was not a cat!

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:43.060
It could have climbed up the ivy.
I mean, it's all over the side of the damned house.

01:19:45.820 --> 01:19:48.300
Look, Kathy. I don't have all the answers yet.

01:19:48.980 --> 01:19:51.260
We've got to get some perspective on this thing.

01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:54.740
Come on.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:56.460
Let's take Jeff's offer.

01:19:56.860 --> 01:19:58.420
Put yourself together.

01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:01.580
Let's get the hell away from it for a couple hours.

01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:04.500
Well, get dressed.

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.060
I just gotta check the fire first.

01:20:18.420 --> 01:20:20.140
Demons are smart.

01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:22.580
They're not just monsters.
They ...

01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:25.940
They think.

01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:27.900
Just like you and I do.

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:30.100
Just in reverse. You know.

01:20:30.300 --> 01:20:31.940
It's a closed system.

01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:35.580
Now you're beginning to give me the creeps.

01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:41.940
There was a tribe of indians called the Shinnecocks.

01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:45.740
And they used this land as a sort of ...
exposure pen.

01:20:48.740 --> 01:20:50.220
They put all the crazy people, here.

01:20:50.340 --> 01:20:51.980
And they left them here to die.

01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:55.900
My god.

01:20:56.380 --> 01:20:58.900
That's where it is.
- What the hell are you talking about?

01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:03.260
There are people buried here.

01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:09.860
Easy.

01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.580
Easy.

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.020
Easy, Harry.

01:21:30.340 --> 01:21:31.820
What the hell are you doing?!

01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:35.300
what is the matter with you?!

01:21:35.420 --> 01:21:36.940
Don't you understand?

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:42.460
It has to be done. That is where the room is!
- What the hell are you doing to my house?!

01:21:42.580 --> 01:21:43.700
I'm trying to tell him.

01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:45.420
That's where it is.

01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.140
She's right.

01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.500
She's right.
There is something here.

01:22:05.460 --> 01:22:06.300
Give me that.

01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:32.060
What's going on?

01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:35.780
Have you all gone mad?
George!

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.180
They ...

01:22:59.820 --> 01:23:01.860
come and go through here.

01:23:13.700 --> 01:23:15.820
Find the well.

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:20.500
It's ... the passage ...

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.180
to hell!

01:23:26.980 --> 01:23:29.220
Cover it!!!

01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:11.700
Hello?

01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:31.340
George, you heard that voice?

01:24:31.820 --> 01:24:34.420
You know whose voice that was?

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:38.380
You heard it! I know you heard it!

01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:47.300
We have to do something, George.
We ...

01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:49.740
We have to do something now.

01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:34.940
Peace to this house and all who enter here.

01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:38.740
Forgive our sins ...
- Peace to this house and all who enter here.

01:25:39.300 --> 01:25:41.980
Grant this
through Jesus Christ, our lord.

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:52.060
What's going on?

01:25:56.580 --> 01:25:58.020
weird people.

01:26:13.660 --> 01:26:15.900
Bless this house and all who enter here.

01:26:16.100 --> 01:26:17.540
Bless this house ...

01:26:19.260 --> 01:26:19.780
What?

01:26:19.900 --> 01:26:21.140
What's happening?

01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.780
Kathy?

01:26:29.060 --> 01:26:29.980
Kathy?

01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.420
Kathy?
- No! Don't touch me!

01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:38.180
Leave me alone, please.

01:26:41.380 --> 01:26:42.740
please?

01:26:58.060 --> 01:27:00.140
Father, since i've come back from Vietnam,

01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:02.980
you've got a tremendous influence in my life. I ...

01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:06.660
I look up to you, I respect you, I admire you.

01:27:06.780 --> 01:27:08.220
And what is your point?!

01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:12.140
Well, I believe that ...

01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:15.580
That I know about fear. I've seen it. I ...

01:27:16.220 --> 01:27:17.660
experienced it.

01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:22.580
Richard, I wish you'd make your point,
because I've got a lot of things to do.

01:27:23.180 --> 01:27:27.220
My point is, father, that I believe we create
our own demons in our own minds.

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:32.700
I'm sorry, father.

01:27:54.620 --> 01:27:56.540
In the name of the father, the son ...

01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.460
and the holy spirit.

01:28:04.860 --> 01:28:06.140
Let us pray.

01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:20.060
Father ...

01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:24.660
by the power of your spirit ...

01:28:25.860 --> 01:28:27.660
you have filled the hearts ...

01:28:29.140 --> 01:28:30.860
of your faithful people.

01:28:32.340 --> 01:28:33.940
With gifts of love ...

01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:36.660
for one another.

01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:42.460
Hear the prayers that we offer
for our relatives and friends.

01:28:43.660 --> 01:28:45.220
Give them health.

01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:48.980
Give them health of mind and body ...

01:28:49.260 --> 01:28:50.300
that ...

01:28:54.060 --> 01:28:58.100
Give them health of mind and body
that they may do your will with perfect love.

01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:02.580
Give them health of mind and body ...

01:29:03.180 --> 01:29:05.740
that they may do your will with perfect love!

01:29:05.860 --> 01:29:06.860
We ask this ...

01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:09.740
through our lord, Jesus Christ, your son!

01:29:11.060 --> 01:29:13.540
Give them strength of mind and body!

01:29:13.660 --> 01:29:17.660
O lord,
I beg thee!

01:29:17.780 --> 01:29:20.580
Give them strength in the name of our lord ...

01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:25.300
Jesus Christ, your son!
O lord!

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:29.460
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:42.660
Richard.

01:29:46.220 --> 01:29:47.540
what is it,
father?

01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.500
I can't see.

01:29:59.020 --> 01:30:00.780
I'm blind.

01:31:18.820 --> 01:31:20.460
What do you want from us?

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:26.660
Goddamn it, this is my house!

01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:22.620
No!

01:32:23.180 --> 01:32:27.100
No, no, no! No!

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:07.820
Oh, no.

01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:11.220
Oh, no.

01:33:12.460 --> 01:33:14.180
I'm coming apart!

01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:17.980
Oh, mother of god, I'm coming apart!

01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:23.340
George?

01:33:24.620 --> 01:33:26.820
George? What hap ...

01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:29.220
I was ...

01:33:29.340 --> 01:33:30.700
just dreaming.

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:32.940
I'm sorry, if I woke you.

01:33:33.140 --> 01:33:34.180
Honey ...

01:33:34.340 --> 01:33:35.860
are you okay?

01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:37.100
Oh, sure.

01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:38.660
Are you sure?

01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.500
Oh, my god.

01:33:45.620 --> 01:33:47.060
What happened to your foot?

01:33:49.580 --> 01:33:50.740
Oh, look.

01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:52.860
Nothing.

01:33:53.380 --> 01:33:54.860
I just tripped.

01:33:58.100 --> 01:34:01.460
Looks like teeth marks.
- Will you stop nagging at me?

01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:04.740
it's always so cold in here.

01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:09.940
Let's get out of here, huh?

01:34:10.060 --> 01:34:12.500
let's just pack up our stuff and go.

01:34:15.380 --> 01:34:18.620
Would you please leave
that damn fire alone and listen to me?!

01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:20.220
I'm not going anywhere.

01:34:20.340 --> 01:34:23.700
You're the one that wanted a house!
This is it, so just shut up!

01:34:24.380 --> 01:34:26.820
You ... bastard.

01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:51.620
Let's go.

01:35:00.820 --> 01:35:03.540
Excuse me. somebody told me,
you could tell me where a ...

01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:04.660
Excuse me?

01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:07.620
Someone told me that you ...
- Hello.

01:35:07.740 --> 01:35:09.580
I ... I'm sorry. I'm Kathy Lutz and ...

01:35:09.700 --> 01:35:11.780
I'm looking for father Delaney.
- Oh.

01:35:13.180 --> 01:35:14.940
Hi, I'm father Bolen.

01:35:15.860 --> 01:35:19.580
I believe father has gone on his vacation.
He's been very overworked and a ...

01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:23.260
I must speak to father Delaney.
I simply must.

01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:28.060
Y- y-you don't understand.
He's more than a priest to me. He's ...

01:35:29.140 --> 01:35:30.540
He's like a friend of mine. He's ...

01:35:30.660 --> 01:35:35.020
helped me through some very difficult times in my life.
And i have to talk to him now!

01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.540
It's ... it's out of my hands.

01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:05.180
hello, father.

01:37:07.260 --> 01:37:08.860
How are you feeling today?

01:37:19.380 --> 01:37:21.940
I brought you some mail.
Would you like me to read it?

01:37:28.500 --> 01:37:30.860
I noticed there's one here from a former patient.

01:37:31.340 --> 01:37:32.420
Would you like to hear it?

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:44.420
It certainly is beautiful here.

01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:51.220
Why don't I arrange?
So we can have our lunch here.

01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:52.780
Would you like that, father?

01:38:30.620 --> 01:38:32.100
Excuse me, father.

01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:34.060
Can I have a word with you?

01:38:35.420 --> 01:38:37.060
Of course, sergeant. Uh ...

01:38:37.460 --> 01:38:38.700
What can I do for you?

01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:39.940
Well ...

01:38:40.900 --> 01:38:42.820
I don't really know exactly.

01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:46.340
You know. It may be just a wild goose chase,
but I'm the curious type.

01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:48.980
Like the man says:
"It goes with the territory".

01:38:49.340 --> 01:38:51.580
Sergeant, I have a great deal of work to do. Could you ...

01:38:51.700 --> 01:38:52.940
make your point, please?

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.700
I'd like to know what's happening to father Delaney.

01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:59.020
You see, he's an old friend. And I can't get the story right.

01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:01.380
Oh, there's no story to get right.

01:39:03.860 --> 01:39:06.100
Maybe I am just chasing shadows.

01:39:06.700 --> 01:39:08.300
If you could excuse me, please.

01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:41.300
I think this has all the good stuff.

01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:43.420
I mean, the major coverage.

01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:47.460
If there's anything else you need, you wanna see.
I'll go back there and get it.

01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:51.780
Hey, that's what I thought. This is the november 14 issue.
That's the day after the murders.

01:39:51.900 --> 01:39:53.020
Now, that crank over there.

01:39:53.140 --> 01:39:56.620
You turn that crank
- That one there? - Right there.

01:39:56.740 --> 01:39:58.540
Each frame is a whole page.

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:01.340
And to get it in focus, you just turn this knob right here.

01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:02.580
Okay, i've got it. i'm fine,
i'm fine. you all set? good.

01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:04.860
Okay? You all set now?
- I'm fine, I'm fine. - Good.
