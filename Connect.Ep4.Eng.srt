1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:03,211
(theme music)

2
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:49,966
DETECTIVE PARK: What's your name?

3
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,095
Your name. Kid, are you deaf?

4
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,271
Ha Dongsoo.

5
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,154
(surgeon chuckles)

6
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:13,490
Oh?

7
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,161
Oh, what's up?

8
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,039
Did something happen?

9
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,917
(body thuds)

10
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,629
(groaning)

11
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,757
JINSEOP: How about we have a nice chat.

12
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,677
I got a lot of questions about this eye.

13
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:37,097
(panting)

14
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:42,018
Hey. Scream and I'll slit your throat.

15
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,478
(groans)

16
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,271
Go ahead, you can talk.

17
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,816
Please don't kill me.

18
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,235
Just let me live.

19
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,487
I'll tell you everything.

20
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:54,197
Only if you talk.

21
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:57,367
My eye.

22
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,537
Let's start with how you got it.

23
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:03,206
SURGEON: I... I don't know.

24
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,795
I just did the surgery.

25
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,630
I don't know anything.

26
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,383
That's not what I wanted to hear.

27
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:17,929
(whimpering)

28
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,268
(clattering in distance)

29
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,770
(approaching footsteps)

30
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,528
(foreboding music)

31
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,882
(clicks tongue)

32
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,599
This damn geezer…

33
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:05,185
Hey, gramps!

34
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:07,687
(glass shattering)

35
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,531
DETECTIVE PARK: Why did you break into M&amp;T Planning?

36
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:26,080
What were you doing running from the crime scene?

37
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,665
Did those thugs have anything to do with it?

38
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:30,919
Come on!

39
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,922
Not gonna talk, are you?

40
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:37,926
DETECTIVE PARK: Fine. See for yourself.

41
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,888
Explain this photo.

42
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,557
(Detective Park clears throat)

43
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,603
What are you, a hyena?

44
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,563
People are dying left and right,

45
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,234
and it's strange that you keep showing up.

46
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,033
(clears throat)

47
00:04:02,116 --> 00:04:03,201
Hey.

48
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:07,789
(whispering) You went to see the astrologer, right?

49
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:08,873
Astra.

50
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,965
God, can you believe this guy?

51
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,299
(sighs)

52
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,928
How'd you know that what you talked about with the astrologer

53
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:26,641
at Astra had anything to do with the corpse art?

54
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,565
DETECTIVE PARK: All right, this bastard did it.

55
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,525
(chair clatters)
Hey.

56
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,446
Say it, you scumbag. We know you killed them.

57
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,117
Say it, damn it. You killed them! Right? Say it.

58
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,494
(panting)

59
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,704
DONGSOO: I knew 'cause of...

60
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,539
(panting continues)

61
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,584
'Cause of a vision.

62
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:55,211
A vision?

63
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,757
No, I mean...

64
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:02,552
(breathes shakily)

65
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,471
Th... the vision...

66
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:10,601
It was kind of like seeing double, maybe?

67
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,186
(sighs)

68
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,607
If you're gonna keep this up, there's nothing we can do.

69
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,609
You want psychiatric evaluation, don't you?

70
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,487
(both grunting)

71
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,489
DETECTIVE PARK: Let's do a quick test.

72
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,451
How many am I holding?

73
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:30,663
No, I don't always have them.

74
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,789
(Dongsoo groans)

75
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,541
(shaky breathing)

76
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:37,337
Sometimes, uh, how do I...

77
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:43,468
So, I get this insane pain out of nowhere,

78
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:49,515
that's when the vision starts.

79
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,562
-Why, you piece of… -Sungjun.

80
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,648
(breathes deeply)

81
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,906
(sighs deeply)

82
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:15,041
You know, it's unusual.

83
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,253
Yes, it really is an unusual case.

84
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,005
So…

85
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:26,928
we have to throw common sense out the window

86
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,137
and deal with this.

87
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,724
All right.

88
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,229
(exhales deeply)

89
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:38,439
Sit down.

90
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,280
You can put your eye patch on if you want.

91
00:07:12,014 --> 00:07:13,015
You know,

92
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,937
I don't think you're lying.

93
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:23,359
And it seems like I'll have to take your story about the visions

94
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:27,321
as it is to get you talking, right?

95
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,698
Hmm?

96
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,535
So I just gotta ask...

97
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:40,793
Out of all the visions, which one concerns you the most right now?

98
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:44,839
(breathes heavily)

99
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,260
The one about the murder that's about to happen.

100
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:52,472
Murder?

101
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,059
Three little girls, elementary school age.

102
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:59,854
-DETECTIVE CHOI: Little girls? -(Dongsoo breathes shakily)

103
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:03,316
DONGSOO: I saw the drawing, the design.

104
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:08,404
It was a new drawing... Different from the past four corpse arts.

105
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,414
What about the symbol for Pluto. How'd you know about that?

106
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,501
DONGSOO: It was drawn there too, in the corner of the design.

107
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,840
Right, then...

108
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,180
Here. This is the victim's body.

109
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:40,686
It was carved on the corpse art.

110
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,064
Really?

111
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,900
(sighs)

112
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,069
DETECTIVE CHOI: Just so we're clear,

113
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,822
I don't think you did it.

114
00:08:55,451 --> 00:09:00,456
I just wanna protect you as a witness.

115
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,584
(inhales deeply) So tell me.

116
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,546
Hm. Why?

117
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,382
How...

118
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,761
do you get those visions?

119
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,264
(gulps)

120
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,392
(breathes deeply)

121
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,603
Those thugs…

122
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:28,234
(gulps)

123
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:29,610
I...

124
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,262
You wanna go somewhere else?

125
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,647
(surgeon groans)

126
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:10,526
SURGEON: I'm telling you! I don't know anything.

127
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:17,199
What's that? What're you gonna do with it? What're you gonna do to me?

128
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,285
(whimpers)

129
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:24,540
Just... just what, just what are you gonna do?

130
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,293
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait...

131
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,336
Ah!

132
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,505
(croaking)

133
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,926
(breathes deeply)

134
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,432
Oh, oh, okay, okay just, please just stop.

135
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,603
I'll tell you everything, please stop.

136
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,520
Tell me what?

137
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,523
Whatever, whatever it is you want, all of it.

138
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:50,650
(groans)

139
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:56,197
And what do you think that is?

140
00:10:57,573 --> 00:11:00,868
(grunts) Please, please stop.

141
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,994
(sobs)

142
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,955
(groans)

143
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:07,875
(yelps)

144
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,257
(surgeon groaning)

145
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,054
You even got someone to stalk me after the surgery, didn't you?

146
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,057
(breathes deeply)

147
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:27,269
At first I thought, maybe it was for customer follow-up.

148
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:31,982
But it was for the eye, wasn't it? What is this eye?

149
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:39,365
It... It could be a Connect.

150
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:41,826
A Connect?

151
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:46,747
It's been over two months

152
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:50,793
since you came to us, right?

153
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,047
(grunting)

154
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,800
(breathes heavily)

155
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,219
Help me.

156
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:01,971
(groans)

157
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:08,185
Whoa, how'd you find this place? What happened to you?

158
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,145
(grunts)

159
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,897
You look like you work at an office.

160
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,860
I heard this place doesn't ask a lot of questions.

161
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,739
Think you can patch me up?

162
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,906
(scoffs)

163
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:24,952
Who knows what'll happen if I put my hands on you.

164
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,412
Go some place else.

165
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,080
JINSEOP: I'll pay.

166
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:31,417
A lot.

167
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,378
Huh?

168
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:37,423
(chuckles)

169
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:41,177
Well, what does a doctor care about his patient's job?

170
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,721
Go lie down on that bed.

171
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,937
Don't bother trying anything dumb…

172
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,565
while I'm out.

173
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,027
My cancer's all over my body.

174
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,907
(chuckles)

175
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,577
Looks like you've done your research.

176
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,912
(both laugh)

177
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,413
DETECTIVE CHOI: How do you like this place?

178
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,749
It's a nice place to talk.

179
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,720
This is the rooftop.

180
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,306
Don't do anything stupid.

181
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,196
(chain clanking)

182
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,787
(foreboding music)

183
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,505
(Dongsoo groans)

184
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:00,548
(cracks)

185
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,386
(pants)

186
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,642
(grunts)

187
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:15,354
(panting)

188
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:26,782
SURGEON: Typically after getting the eye and the internal organs,

189
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:30,953
the rest are just thrown out.

190
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:37,877
That day, I was working like any other day,

191
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,505
but he ran away.

192
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:46,218
Ran away? Did the anesthesia not work?

193
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:52,099
Well, I opened his chest,

194
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:55,603
but he ran.

195
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,691
Like the cuts just healed in the blink of an eye?

196
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,818
(tense music)

197
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,447
So you know.

198
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,491
DONGSOO: Why my body is like this…

199
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:15,456
how it became like this, I couldn't tell you if you asked.

200
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,376
I just don't know how it happened.

201
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,004
(scoffs)

202
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,177
I did not expect that.

203
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,012
(scoffs)

204
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,849
They call this type of body...

205
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:39,563
They call it a Connect. I just learned about it.

206
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:45,986
So basically, a body called a Connect rolled in,

207
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,031
and you decided to test an eye transplant...

208
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:54,495
(foreboding music)

209
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,130
...on me.

210
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:07,841
Around the year 2000,

211
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:11,345
Jeongdo Pharmaceuticals made this groundbreaking discovery

212
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:16,976
in biotechnology at their research facility.

213
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:21,897
They called it "Connect",

214
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
and people said…

215
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:31,031
it was a revolutionary invention in bio-transplanting.

216
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:37,621
Some even said it could have something to do with immortality.

217
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:46,547
So that means I have a body part that's immortal, right?

218
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,718
We share the vision.

219
00:16:54,346 --> 00:16:55,931
Whatever he sees,

220
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,810
I see.

221
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:07,109
That's good news, right? To someone with late-stage cancer.

222
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,124
Please,

223
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,044
you said you wouldn't kill me.

224
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,503
(sobs)

225
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:27,921
(grunts)

226
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,175
(groans)

227
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,849
(laughs)

228
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,064
That was everything.

229
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:51,278
Now what about you, detective? What are you gonna do?

230
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:57,951
Are you gonna expose me?

231
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:14,301
It's the only way we can convince people. The only way.

232
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:18,639
And I have to do it 'cause I'm a detective.

233
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:22,601
'Cause I have to protect victims and catch criminals.

234
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,145
(scoffs)

235
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:34,029
What, so what I did doesn't matter…

236
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,741
'cause I'm a monster?

237
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:45,707
Yeah, how'd the background check go?

238
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,959
DETECTIVE PARK (on cell phone): Long story short, it's...

239
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,168
Wait, just a second.

240
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,088
Go ahead.

241
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:54,216
Everything that Ha Dongsoo told us about his identity is fake.

242
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,343
His fingerprints aren't even registered.

243
00:18:56,844 --> 00:19:03,725
And, well, that makes it legally impossible to say he even exists.

244
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,269
Completely unidentified.

245
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,480
You heard it yourself.

246
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:16,947
Detective Park, look into those organ hunters a little more.

247
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:20,200
DETECTIVE PARK (on cell phone): Already on it. Oh Jinseop, too.

248
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,623
Did you lie to me?

249
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,750
(sighs)

250
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,754
Your part's done. We don't need...

251
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,006
(shouts) Detective!

252
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,011
I'm the only one who knows the faces of the kids he's gonna kill.

253
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:43,724
-So please just let me go. -No.

254
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:46,018
We need to stop him.

255
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,521
We're gonna catch him. So let it go.

256
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:55,235
(foreboding music)

257
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:04,203

258
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,542
Hey, stop it.

259
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:13,337
(groans)

260
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,801
I said, stop it.

261
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,095
(breathing heavily)

262
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:34,358

264
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,781
This world's never been kind to me.

265
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,035
I shouldn't have trusted a detective.

266
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,707
Don’t move.

267
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:54,086
Stop right there.

268
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,924
-I said, stop! -(gunshot)

269
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:07,391
Get down. Get down.

270
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,693
Stop!

271
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,778

272
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:22,990

Hey, go, go, go, hurry!

284
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:20,839
Move!

285
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:29,598

286
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:30,974
Move!

00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,770
Hey, Jinsoo!

00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:38,273
Hey, what happened up there at the rooftop?

339
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:07,500
who Oh Jinseop was before the transplant?

340
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:09,044
(laughs)

341
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:13,089
We don't care about that. We just need the money.

342
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,301
(Woojin grunts)

343
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,475
(breathes nervously)

344
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,619
(siren blaring)

345
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:48,291
DONGSOO: I'm gonna set all the elementary schools

346
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:49,834
in the city on fire.

347
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,714
You know I'm serious.

348
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:58,551
Any kid walking the streets...

349
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,638
is gonna die.

350
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,933
(siren blaring continues)

351
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,147
Yeah.

352
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:12,190
DETECTIVE PARK (on cell phone): 119 just reported

353
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:13,733
a possible terrorist attack and sent us a call recording.

354
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:14,818
Oh, yeah?

355
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,319
And the voice is Ha Dongsoo's.

356
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:21,116
Then send a shut-down notice to all the elementary schools in the city.

357
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,869
Say there's a terrorist on the loose.

358
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:29,374
Heard he'll bomb an elementary school, something like that.

359
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:33,628
I'll report to the higher-ups, be quick. Okay.

360
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,130
REPORTER: Breaking news.

361
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,133
Early this morning, a threatening call was made announcing

362
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:41,845
a bombing of all the elementary schools in Seohan City.

363
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,681
An elementary school in the city actually suffered an explosion

364
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:47,267
-around the time of the threat. -Interesting move, Guitar Man.

365
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,521
And firefighters were dispatched and put out the fire in an hour.

366
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,815
Fortunately, there were no casualties.

367
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,401
(sighing)

368
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:09,956
(light music)

369
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,252
OFFICIAL_Z: DID YOU LISTEN TO THE SONG?

370
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:17,338
I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW WHAT THE ORIGINAL ARTIST THINKS

371
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:22,927
OF COURSE I LISTENED TO IT. YOU'RE THE BEST MUSICIAN.

372
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,638
LONELY GUITAR MAN: OF COURSE I LISTENED TO IT.

373
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,015
YOU'RE THE BEST MUSICIAN.

374
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,773
OFFICIAL_Z: WHEW… I WAS WORRIED…

375
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:36,107
GLAD TO KNOW YOU LIKED IT.

376
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,317
DONGSOO: Man…

377
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,200
OFFICIAL_Z: YOUR SONG IS REALLY GREAT. EVEN BETTER THAN MY ARRANGEMENT

378
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:47,035
SO DON'T GIVE UP… REACH ME IF YOU WANT TO MEET

379
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,788
IT'D BE EVEN BETTER IF WE COULD PLAY TOGETHER.

380
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,039
(exhales deeply)

381
00:29:58,338 --> 00:29:59,506
(groans)

382
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,676
(groaning continues)

383
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:11,643
NEW TEXT MESSAGE: CAN YOU SEE THIS?

384
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:22,695
IF YOU CAN, CALL ME

385
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,745
(groans)

386
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:34,290
(cell phone vibrates)

387
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:42,590
(chuckles)

388
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,057
Who are you?

389
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,063
JINSEOP (on cell phone): Hiding the caller ID, that's a surprise.

390
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,859
That's not even your phone.

391
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,362
JINSEOP: You seem smart.

392
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:09,242
What do I call you? Guitar Man?

393
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:13,204
-JINSEOP: Pyromaniac? -Shut your trap, you lunatic.

394
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,956
(laughs)

395
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:21,004
You're a real hothead. You were like that at the office building.

396
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:24,299
You think the world revolves around you?

397
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,677
Not after this.

398
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,137
(chuckles)

399
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,848
It's too late, you know.

400
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,726
What do you mean?

401
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:39,606
JINSEOP: I mean it's already gone on to the next phase.

402
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:42,734
Don’t you think it's fate?

403
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,487
That one of your eyes ended up with me.

404
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:49,908
Tell me, what's the next phase?

405
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,618
That's for you to find out.

406
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:57,665
I want you to know everything about me, okay?

407
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,338
Let's talk again, Connect buddy.

408
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,334
Oh!

409
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,878
Man, it's a dog turd.

410
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,589
Damn it.

411
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,680
MALE PASSERBY: Just my luck.

412
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,979
(ominous music)

413
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:17,954
DONGSOO: Why didn't you answer my call?

414
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,000
I'm sorry, I was dealing with something.

415
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:26,504
You were right.

416
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,297
They know I'm a Connect.

417
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,509
It might get dangerous for you too.

418
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,848
Right now, your place is the least safe for you.

419
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,575
SCREENING SCHEDULE: AUDITION

420
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:18,306
DONGSOO: Wow, this place was a movie theater?

421
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,894
IRANG: Are you gonna run away again?

422
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:29,358
If you're scared of getting caught, you better stay here.

423
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,943
I'll go get your eye back.

424
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,031
DONGSOO: How?

425
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,242
However I can.

426
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,297
What do you know?

427
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:55,343
What do you think I don't know?

428
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,429
What it's like living as a Connect?

429
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,519
I don't think we're that different.

430
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:07,647
What?

431
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,447
Try stabbing me.

432
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,701
Are you insane?

433
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:30,336
You'll know once you stab me.

434
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,049
And if you get hurt?

435
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,846
Are you gonna take responsibility?

436
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,777
(gasps)

437
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,159
(soft trilling)

438
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,218
You're the same as me?

439
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:24,682
Yeah.

440
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,105
Did you lie?

441
00:36:32,481 --> 00:36:34,358
About being saved by a Connect?

442
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,445
Half of it was true,

443
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,615
the part about getting hit by the dump truck,

444
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,658
and surviving thanks to a Connect body.

445
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,913
I was gonna tell you after you got your eye back.

446
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,542
(sighs)

447
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:01,802
You don't need a band-aid.

448
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,892
IRANG: I wished I did.

449
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:12,396
This is something weak kids,

450
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,441
normal kids put on.

451
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,654
This was proof that I was one.

452
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:24,533
So I started putting it on, but one day

453
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,953
it kind of became a talisman.

454
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,790
When I have this on,

455
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:35,753
they wouldn't find out I'm a Connect.

456
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,258
But...

457
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,135
You're right.

458
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,146
I don't need it anymore.

459
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,731
(band-aid rustles)

460
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:09,370
I'm happy.

461
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:11,330
Mm?

462
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,837
That there's someone just like me...

463
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,466
I'm really glad that it's you,

464
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,136
Choi Irang.

465
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,602
You don't have to suffer alone now.

466
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,069
Neither do you.

467
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:47,950
Give me that.

468
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,215
Gimme your hand.

469
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,349
(light music)

470
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,788
(upbeat music)

471
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,315

00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,202

473
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:04,003
(Z inhales deeply) Let's go.

474
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,424
(car alarm beeps)

475
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,676
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

476
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,886
(both laugh)

477
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,095
(murmurs)

478
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,431
Huh, oh.

479
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:16,974

481
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:32,448
This is what happens when you steal someone else's song.

482
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:49,215

What, what's wrong?

488
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,999
(ominous music)

489
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,630
DONGSOO: He didn't give up.

490
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:13,173
(panting)

491
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:22,266
