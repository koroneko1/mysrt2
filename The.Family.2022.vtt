Caleb!

01:40.936 --> 01:44.773
-[indiscernible speech]
-[Elijah] Like I do.

01:44.807 --> 01:46.609
He carries me in pain.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.150
Down!

01:56.184 --> 01:58.721
[Elijah thuds]

02:00.421 --> 02:05.159
The soul of the sluggard
craves and gets nothing.

02:07.362 --> 02:11.834
While the soul of the good
man is richly supplied.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.439
There, there.

02:21.476 --> 02:22.978
Evelyn, Abigail!

02:29.384 --> 02:31.352
I hope I can trust
thee with this task.

02:33.555 --> 02:34.389
Yes, sir.

02:39.695 --> 02:43.297
Tell to me the ways in
which you have failed.

02:46.735 --> 02:47.770
Tell me!

02:49.571 --> 02:53.241
Here, before our lord eternal,

02:53.274 --> 02:56.411
face the consequences
of your malignancy.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.848
[grunting]

03:04.920 --> 03:07.089
Forgive me father,
for I disrespect you.

03:08.891 --> 03:13.095
My lineage, my maker Etan
who hath given me mould.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.364
I see now my wicked
ways and I repent.

03:29.243 --> 03:32.681
[Elijah breaths heavily]

03:37.653 --> 03:41.456
Repent thee, for you
have forged a path

03:41.489 --> 03:43.324
that cannot be undone.

03:53.769 --> 03:54.737
Come on.

03:54.770 --> 03:55.804
-No.
-Yes.

03:55.838 --> 03:57.606
-No, Father.
-Yes.

03:57.639 --> 03:59.407
-No.
-Come on!

03:59.440 --> 04:00.876
No!

04:00.909 --> 04:02.010
Caleb!

04:02.044 --> 04:03.112
Go!

04:03.145 --> 04:03.979
No!

04:04.012 --> 04:04.980
-No!
-Get up, go.

04:05.013 --> 04:06.215
-Caleb!
-Come on!

-Caleb!

Caleb!

04:08.851 --> 04:10.052
Get up.

05:27.629 --> 05:30.666
Abigail, will thou
lead us in prayer?

05:32.433 --> 05:33.268
Yes, Father.

05:37.906 --> 05:41.375
Our leader Etan,
savior and protector.

05:42.511 --> 05:45.547
We live another day safe
from the interloper,

05:45.581 --> 05:48.083
the piper who seeks
to steal our souls.

05:49.117 --> 05:52.788
May he be cast from our
family, from our land,

05:52.821 --> 05:56.390
only if we do not search for
them, will they lay dormant.

05:56.424 --> 06:00.696
For we take refuge in
your name, blessed be.

06:00.729 --> 06:02.898
[all] Blessed be.

06:02.931 --> 06:04.166
And blessed are we.

06:05.334 --> 06:09.171
For tomorrow, one of
us will become a man.

06:20.649 --> 06:25.654
-[rain pouring]
-[clouds rumbling]

06:31.760 --> 06:33.829
Blessed be, Abigail.

06:37.366 --> 06:39.201
Blessed be, Evelyn.

06:51.380 --> 06:52.514
Blessed be, Caleb.

06:53.782 --> 06:55.617
May he look upon thee...

06:57.485 --> 06:58.553
always.

07:01.056 --> 07:02.124
Blessed be.

07:03.258 --> 07:05.093
He smiles down upon our family,

07:05.127 --> 07:07.329
and bestows upon
us good fortune.

07:13.735 --> 07:15.003
Blessed be the land.

07:16.405 --> 07:18.807
May the spirits of evil
never cross this threshold.

07:20.242 --> 07:23.111
May we who live in this
home guide the sacredness

07:23.145 --> 07:24.112
of its doorway.

07:26.281 --> 07:29.418
There are sectors of Etan's
followers all over the earth

07:30.585 --> 07:34.056
and even though we may
be the very last of men,

07:35.223 --> 07:37.859
indignant we remain to
the advances of Abaddon.

07:39.895 --> 07:41.897
-Blessed be.
-Blessed be.

07:41.930 --> 07:43.899
-Blessed be.
-Blessed be.

07:43.932 --> 07:46.768
[clouds rumbling]

07:50.038 --> 07:52.240
Caleb, he calls for thee.

07:54.009 --> 07:57.879
Stand in front of your
savior as he does grace you

07:57.913 --> 07:59.348
with his presence.

07:59.381 --> 08:03.652
El-Shalah, do we not prophesy
in your name, and cast out

08:03.685 --> 08:08.690
demons in your name, and do
many mighty works in your name.

08:09.624 --> 08:11.560
-Blessed be.
-Blessed be.

08:11.593 --> 08:13.562
-Blessed be.
-Blessed be.

08:13.595 --> 08:18.600
Caleb, I ask of thee, does
thou stand without fear

08:19.868 --> 08:21.370
in the presence of Etan?

08:22.804 --> 08:26.141
Does thy unwavering faith
cast away the idolaters,

08:26.174 --> 08:29.311
and interlopers who
seek to be in the light?

08:32.647 --> 08:33.482
Yes.

08:34.950 --> 08:37.152
Then let the prophecy
be fulfilled.

08:39.921 --> 08:43.458
Etan shall bestow
upon you a bride,

08:45.427 --> 08:47.129
and together you
will lead our family

08:47.162 --> 08:49.031
in the fight against darkness.

08:50.032 --> 08:54.836
Destined as I to lead thy
brothers and sisters to Etan.

08:56.004 --> 08:58.607
You two shall one
day lead the flock.

09:02.978 --> 09:05.247
-Blessed be.
-Blessed be.

09:09.251 --> 09:11.319
[grunts]

09:16.058 --> 09:18.427
Caleb, finish up.

09:18.460 --> 09:20.128
Check the traps before sunset.

09:21.797 --> 09:22.631
Right, Father.

09:23.565 --> 09:24.833
Father, I can check the traps.

09:24.866 --> 09:26.568
I've finished my
chores for today.

09:28.270 --> 09:32.340
No, you will leave
men's work to the men,

09:32.374 --> 09:34.376
and do as he commands.

09:35.877 --> 09:36.878
Yes, Father.

10:08.210 --> 10:11.213

[dramatic music]

12:50.972 --> 12:52.107
Empty traps?

12:53.975 --> 12:55.243
Aye.

12:55.277 --> 12:56.978
Seems Etan has not
favored us today.

12:58.847 --> 12:59.615
Seems not.

13:17.198 --> 13:18.033
Abi?

13:20.503 --> 13:22.672
Ab, are you awake?

13:22.705 --> 13:23.506
No.

13:28.009 --> 13:29.210
I saw something today.

13:30.845 --> 13:32.047
Out when I was trapping.

13:34.416 --> 13:35.984
At least, I think I saw it.

13:38.086 --> 13:39.755
Well, what was it?

13:41.122 --> 13:45.528
They tell us that we're
alone, but what if we're not?

13:49.064 --> 13:51.032
Those who tread wildly
will pay repentance,

13:51.066 --> 13:53.335
for every careless
word they utter.

13:59.341 --> 14:01.376
It's late for them
to be moving about.

14:01.409 --> 14:02.310
[Abigail] Leave it, Caleb.

14:04.145 --> 14:04.979
Let me sleep.

14:27.001 --> 14:29.839
[dramatic music]

14:33.509 --> 14:34.943
Remember what
happened to Evelyn

14:34.976 --> 14:36.812
when she was caught out of bed?

14:36.846 --> 14:38.246
When father took her tongue,

14:39.414 --> 14:40.915
and what happened
to poor Elijah.

14:49.825 --> 14:50.626
Look.

15:01.804 --> 15:04.372
Up out of your beds
at such a late hour.

15:05.440 --> 15:06.408
I'm sorry.

15:06.441 --> 15:07.375
Enough.

15:10.679 --> 15:15.584
Children, tell me, do
you not love your mother?

15:17.185 --> 15:18.186
-Yes'm.
-Yes'm.

15:20.355 --> 15:23.458
Then why must you hurt me
with your disobedience?

15:25.193 --> 15:28.329
You know your mother loves you.

15:32.835 --> 15:33.669
And you?

15:34.969 --> 15:36.705
A lady knows her case.

15:37.907 --> 15:41.476
Do not let temptation
expose you to Abaddon.

15:46.515 --> 15:48.584
But we were just
worried about Elijah.

15:50.553 --> 15:53.421
Your father knows best
what to do with Elijah.

15:53.455 --> 15:55.658
Remove him from your thoughts
for they are nothing,

15:55.691 --> 15:56.926
but blasphemy.

15:58.059 --> 15:59.762
Sleep well, my children.

16:17.078 --> 16:19.682
[girl screams]

16:35.798 --> 16:39.133
One of you has committed
the gravest of sins.

16:41.436 --> 16:44.507
Speak, for Etan surely knows.

16:45.674 --> 16:47.910
Tell me, child,
has thy curiosity

16:47.943 --> 16:49.344
got the better of thee, again?

16:49.377 --> 16:51.547
No, I swear it.

16:54.115 --> 16:55.951
Is it you, girl?

16:57.252 --> 16:59.053
You constantly offend him.

17:00.154 --> 17:02.023
-You're an abomination.
-No!

17:04.727 --> 17:07.295
It was I who breached
the threshold.

17:11.399 --> 17:13.569
An accident, I-- I promise.

17:16.572 --> 17:18.007
Please leave her.

17:20.543 --> 17:22.878
Everyone to the chapel.

17:22.912 --> 17:24.980
Only prayer will
guide us through this.

17:26.447 --> 17:30.418
Boy, you have no idea
what you have done.

17:34.657 --> 17:35.490
I...

17:37.693 --> 17:38.727
Take me to it.

17:39.862 --> 17:40.696
The breach.

17:41.897 --> 17:45.166
And pray for your sake
that it can be undone.

17:53.609 --> 17:55.911
Don't you dare look at me, boy.

17:57.012 --> 17:59.447
He has still to decide thy fate.

18:01.149 --> 18:03.986
[dramatic music]

18:06.021 --> 18:06.855
Kneel.

18:21.369 --> 18:25.541
-[thuds]
-[sobbing]

18:40.656 --> 18:43.491
It is in your mercy we beg.

18:43.525 --> 18:44.994
Right this wrong.

18:45.027 --> 18:49.098
Spare our family for I know
Caleb's heart to be true.

18:53.068 --> 18:55.136
Can the threshold be healed?

18:57.039 --> 18:57.940
I do not know.

18:58.974 --> 19:00.776
It is not up to you or I.

19:01.944 --> 19:04.947
Tell me, what drew thee there?

19:06.015 --> 19:07.616
You know, it's
against my teachings.

19:11.820 --> 19:13.421
I thought I saw someone.

19:15.356 --> 19:18.827
I thought, perhaps
it could be the bride

19:18.861 --> 19:20.663
of whom Etan had spoken.

19:23.599 --> 19:28.537
I see now it was just a figment
brought on to seduce me,

19:32.074 --> 19:33.441
to steal my soul.

19:36.377 --> 19:40.115
It is a lonely existence,
but we must be brave.

19:40.149 --> 19:44.053
Etan, in all his wisdom,
has chosen us to carry out

19:44.086 --> 19:47.990
his plan, and create a
world as he intended.

19:49.424 --> 19:52.695
If we pray, we may have a
glimpse of what will be.

20:04.707 --> 20:05.541
Come now.

20:07.408 --> 20:09.845
You must atone for your sins.

20:21.857 --> 20:23.625
Are you all right, brother?

20:59.194 --> 21:02.430
El-Shalah, who presides over us,

21:04.600 --> 21:06.635
watch over our family,

21:06.668 --> 21:09.638
as we come to you in
a time of great need.

21:12.641 --> 21:16.578
Protect our threshold as we
stand within your inner circle.

21:19.581 --> 21:23.519
And if thy word be true, and
you will bring me a bride.

21:26.989 --> 21:31.994
Please see it through and
let her be delivered safely

21:32.728 --> 21:34.163
into our waiting arms.

21:39.400 --> 21:42.771
Etan be the light that guides us

21:42.805 --> 21:44.773
through the darkest of days.

22:04.593 --> 22:07.428
[dramatic music]

22:08.931 --> 22:09.765
Quiet.

22:17.438 --> 22:19.842
Children, get to the house.

22:19.875 --> 22:22.211
Your father will protect us.

22:23.745 --> 22:26.582
[dramatic music]

22:29.383 --> 22:33.421
Spare us and bring us quickly
and safely to thy kingdom.

22:35.290 --> 22:38.560
[indiscernible speech]

22:40.729 --> 22:43.966
[indiscernible speech]

22:47.736 --> 22:50.038
Not to worry, we are safe.

22:52.741 --> 22:57.145
Abigail, perhaps you can
recite a passage from the...

22:57.179 --> 22:58.747
Deliver us.

22:58.780 --> 23:01.950
[indiscernible speech]

23:06.989 --> 23:07.890
Deliver us.

23:08.857 --> 23:09.825
Deliver us.

23:09.858 --> 23:11.293
Deliver us.

23:11.326 --> 23:12.561
Deliver us.

23:12.594 --> 23:13.662
We are safe.

23:13.695 --> 23:17.900
-[indiscernible speech]
-We are safe.

23:19.935 --> 23:23.038
[crickets chirping]

24:02.778 --> 24:06.615
Come, we must prepare
ourselves for chapel.

24:08.417 --> 24:09.251
Come!

24:20.562 --> 24:22.965
[soft music]

24:32.274 --> 24:36.178
Today, we must consider
our good fortune, as Etan,

24:36.211 --> 24:40.248
in all his grace, has given us
another member of our flock.

24:43.118 --> 24:46.321
Caleb, I give thee
Mary, thy bride to be.

24:48.690 --> 24:50.459
Just as Etan has promised.

24:56.665 --> 25:00.802
And let us pray for Mary, for
she faces a tremendous task.

25:00.836 --> 25:03.472
Etan's grace is not
bestowed easily,

25:03.505 --> 25:05.574
but through great sacrifice.

25:08.977 --> 25:13.782
My dear, Etan's path may
not be without its pitfalls,

25:15.250 --> 25:18.520
but I promise it will
lead to the light.

25:21.323 --> 25:25.961
I... how did she survive
Abaddon's angels?

25:25.994 --> 25:30.999
Because Etan is good, and
because we have prayed for it.

25:31.967 --> 25:33.168
He hath made it so.

25:34.836 --> 25:35.904
Now come.

25:44.613 --> 25:45.680
Take her hand.

25:47.616 --> 25:51.953
Be good to her, family,
for we must embolden her

25:51.987 --> 25:52.988
with our strengths.

25:59.161 --> 26:01.696
[Mary humming]

26:43.772 --> 26:46.174
We must rest tonight.

26:46.208 --> 26:48.511
For tomorrow we bear the
fruits of our labors.

26:50.580 --> 26:55.551
Caleb, I trust you can
clean without supervision.

26:57.652 --> 26:58.854
Take Mary to help you.

27:00.055 --> 27:03.625
When you're finished,
return her to her room.

27:05.660 --> 27:06.495
Yes sir.

When the light, like no
other would anoint me,

27:46.234 --> 27:48.270

27:53.341 --> 27:54.610
I know this must be hard.

27:56.344 --> 27:58.614
I don't know from
whence you came,

27:58.648 --> 28:01.349
but I know it must
not compare to here.

28:03.018 --> 28:04.019
But you have us now.

28:06.922 --> 28:11.927
And if you work hard, with
thy head down, I promise...

28:15.163 --> 28:17.799
I will let no harm come to you.

28:22.938 --> 28:23.805

carry on like that?

29:06.481 --> 29:11.486
she appears here as if from
the thin air, no explanation.

29:12.821 --> 29:16.324
No sense of where
she was from before.

29:16.358 --> 29:17.560
But I can explain it.

29:18.594 --> 29:20.195
In Etan's good fortune.

29:21.763 --> 29:25.701
And she appeared just as
the prophecy proclaimed.

29:25.735 --> 29:27.202
Please.

29:27.235 --> 29:30.238
Just a day ago, you were
questioning his teachings.

29:31.473 --> 29:34.744
Yes, and I see how I was wrong.

29:36.444 --> 29:39.147
I see it now as I
see it in her gaze.

29:43.985 --> 29:45.787
I saw father cross
the threshold.

29:48.023 --> 29:53.028
As thou have crossed it, too.

You shouldn't be sneaking about.

What is it you saw out there?

A small structure.

30:11.614 --> 30:12.515
It was nothing.

30:13.716 --> 30:15.718
Just an old decrepit wood shed.

father lived before

with this land.

careless word you utter.

swinging that ax.

55:26.895 --> 55:29.965
Caleb, keep swinging like that,

55:29.998 --> 55:32.100
you'll have nothing
left, but kindling.

55:38.740 --> 55:40.341
How dare you walk away from me?

55:40.374 --> 55:42.144
Leave me be!

55:42.177 --> 55:43.312
I do my work.

55:43.344 --> 55:45.013
I do my chores.

55:45.047 --> 55:46.248
Leave me to them!

55:47.983 --> 55:50.919
If thou continues on
this path, I will--

55:50.953 --> 55:52.120
You will what?

55:53.655 --> 55:54.488
Oh.

55:57.826 --> 55:59.261
Good for you, son.

55:59.294 --> 56:01.230
I always wondered if you'd
ever grow a backbone,

56:01.263 --> 56:03.832
and if you ask me,
it's about time.

56:06.668 --> 56:09.037
Everyone, look at Caleb.

56:09.071 --> 56:13.275
He wants to assert himself as
a man, assert his dominance.

56:13.308 --> 56:14.375
Take notice.

56:15.344 --> 56:17.012
How selfish.

56:17.045 --> 56:19.715
Every day I pray for thy sins.

56:19.748 --> 56:22.651
I am forced to make
sacrifices of the flesh.

56:25.087 --> 56:27.756
Yet you stand here, just a boy.

56:27.789 --> 56:30.458
Not even able to
pleasure his own wife.

56:30.491 --> 56:32.060
Caleb, don't!

56:32.094 --> 56:33.128
Stay out of this, girl.

56:33.161 --> 56:34.897
This be the business of men.

56:34.930 --> 56:36.865
Enough!

56:36.899 --> 56:40.269
When song and prayer failed
to rectify our vessels,

56:40.302 --> 56:42.671
we must turn to our last resort.

56:45.741 --> 56:46.975
Sacrifice.

56:51.313 --> 56:53.982
Abigail, come stand by me.

56:54.016 --> 56:56.685
Mary, please sing us a hymn.

56:59.521 --> 57:02.456
[Mary humming]

57:02.490 --> 57:06.094
Oh Etan, we beg for forgiveness,

57:06.128 --> 57:08.664
for we are as yet
to be your mortals.

57:10.165 --> 57:13.201
Find it in your
divine compassion

57:13.235 --> 57:17.205
to lead us to the light.

57:17.239 --> 57:19.041
-[Abigail screams]
-No!

57:19.074 --> 57:21.743
Careful boy, or meet thy maker.

57:23.645 --> 57:25.681
You need to shoot me, so be it,

57:25.714 --> 57:27.683
but I will not let
her die for my sins.

57:29.084 --> 57:32.321
Not up to us to question
the will of Etan.

57:32.354 --> 57:33.388
Help!

57:33.422 --> 57:35.357
Caleb, help me!

57:35.390 --> 57:38.360
Cleanse me of thy sins
in the name of El-Shalah.

57:38.393 --> 57:43.265
Oh lord, please rid us of the
evil that plagues our family.

57:43.298 --> 57:44.032
[screaming]

57:44.066 --> 57:45.701
-[screaming underwater]
-Stop!

57:45.867 --> 57:49.137
[garbled,
indiscernible speech]

57:51.106 --> 57:55.377
I pray if there are
any who doubt you...

57:55.410 --> 57:58.146
[indiscernible speech]

57:58.180 --> 58:00.115
-Blessed be!
-Stop it!

58:02.951 --> 58:05.020
Your choice, boy.

58:05.053 --> 58:06.555
'Cause you're filled with pride

58:06.588 --> 58:11.593
and you will let this girl die.

58:12.894 --> 58:14.563
Forgive me please.

58:36.118 --> 58:39.054
[Abigail coughing]

58:45.827 --> 58:48.597
You are losing your flock.

58:48.630 --> 58:52.200
An impotent man is useless
in the eyes of Etan.

59:20.162 --> 59:20.996
No!

59:23.498 --> 59:24.866
You know better.

59:35.444 --> 59:37.079
Mary, will you lead us?

59:54.596 --> 59:55.931
Oh divine one...

1:00:01.837 --> 1:00:02.671
How is she?

1:00:06.608 --> 1:00:08.578
Fear not, my consort.

1:00:08.610 --> 1:00:11.246
For he hath not less
faith than thee.

1:00:11.279 --> 1:00:13.115
For I once stood
where you stand now.

1:00:14.749 --> 1:00:17.319
I once stood where the
light could not reach me.

1:00:19.087 --> 1:00:20.556
But I feel it now.

1:00:20.590 --> 1:00:25.561
And it's warm in its embrace
and so shall you feel it again.

1:00:31.233 --> 1:00:35.370
As Father teaches, you
must cut out the boil

1:00:35.403 --> 1:00:36.304
to cure the wound.

1:00:42.377 --> 1:00:43.178
Caleb?

1:00:50.785 --> 1:00:53.589
[dramatic music]

1:00:59.828 --> 1:01:01.062
Heed be.

1:01:01.096 --> 1:01:03.398
For I do not fear
death any longer.

1:01:05.601 --> 1:01:07.269
Go to the children.

1:01:07.302 --> 1:01:09.137
I'll take care of him.

1:01:12.240 --> 1:01:13.942
Come now, boy.

1:01:15.243 --> 1:01:18.280
It's not too late to
beg for forgiveness.

1:01:19.915 --> 1:01:23.351
Oh, I promise thee that
every time you defy his plan,

1:01:23.385 --> 1:01:27.222
he will come down two
times in punishment.

1:01:28.423 --> 1:01:32.060
You say, it be his plan,
but you know it is lies

1:01:32.093 --> 1:01:33.563
that spew through thy mouth.

1:01:38.333 --> 1:01:40.502
So you think you know better?

1:01:43.338 --> 1:01:48.009
Pity, you will never have
the wisdom of your father.

1:01:48.043 --> 1:01:49.911
Well, I suppose
we best find out.

1:01:55.150 --> 1:01:57.118
[yells]

1:01:58.386 --> 1:02:00.556
Where be your angels, Father?

1:02:01.756 --> 1:02:04.726
Etan does not punish
his loyal disciples.

1:02:04.759 --> 1:02:05.994
Lies!

1:02:06.027 --> 1:02:09.532
Etan speaks to me and
demands thy punishment.

1:02:09.565 --> 1:02:14.436
Hear me now, Father, for
you do not have much time.

1:02:14.469 --> 1:02:16.471
For here is your reckoning.

1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:19.874
And for me it does not
constitute enough--

1:02:19.908 --> 1:02:20.742
Aaah!

1:02:21.711 --> 1:02:23.945
[grunting]

1:02:26.348 --> 1:02:28.517
I thought you were a man.

1:02:29.619 --> 1:02:31.353
Not the boy I first met.

1:02:32.821 --> 1:02:34.489
Just a boy.

1:02:34.523 --> 1:02:35.890
Enough.

1:02:35.924 --> 1:02:38.260
Fallen prey to the
temptations of the flesh.

1:02:38.293 --> 1:02:40.161
You know what I'm capable of.

1:02:40.195 --> 1:02:41.296
Then show me.

1:02:52.240 --> 1:02:55.377
Quickly, girls, we
have little time.

1:03:02.718 --> 1:03:07.523
Come, girl, or does one
wish to join one's brother?

1:03:08.857 --> 1:03:09.692
Hmm?

1:03:20.636 --> 1:03:22.304
Quickly!

1:03:22.337 --> 1:03:24.139
The rains may yet come.

1:03:34.784 --> 1:03:37.687
[thunder rumbling]

1:03:48.830 --> 1:03:49.964
Our creator,

1:03:52.601 --> 1:03:53.435
our shepherd,

1:03:56.104 --> 1:03:57.606
giver or life.

1:03:59.908 --> 1:04:02.745
Today, we must thank
you for this bounty

1:04:02.778 --> 1:04:04.079
that thou lay before us.

1:04:05.514 --> 1:04:08.684
For it is insufficient to
merely say Etan is good.

1:04:16.925 --> 1:04:19.861
We pray to you
tonight in jubilance

1:04:19.894 --> 1:04:23.231
as we have witnessed firsthand
your immense kindness.

1:04:25.433 --> 1:04:28.036
We've done nothing to
deserve this El-Shalah.

1:04:28.069 --> 1:04:30.506
But we accept it
with graciousness

1:04:30.539 --> 1:04:34.242
knowing it is in your power
to take it away if you please.

1:04:36.044 --> 1:04:39.948
Etan blesses us for
our faith and service.

1:04:39.981 --> 1:04:43.719
If we love and respect our
father, then he will provide.

1:04:47.188 --> 1:04:51.226
Anyone who challenges Etan
will be punished and cleansed.

1:04:54.129 --> 1:04:57.867
We are undeserving of
that kindness, El-Shalah,

1:04:57.899 --> 1:05:01.002
and owe to you our
eternal gratitude.

1:05:02.036 --> 1:05:02.904
Etan!

1:05:02.937 --> 1:05:03.938
... be free!

1:05:07.442 --> 1:05:08.443
Let me free.

1:05:10.880 --> 1:05:11.714
Etan!

1:05:15.917 --> 1:05:16.918
Let me free.

1:05:22.725 --> 1:05:26.161
[Father] But instead we must
show you in our actions,

1:05:26.194 --> 1:05:28.798
in our prayers, that
we are forever in debt

1:05:28.831 --> 1:05:29.998
of your kindness.

1:05:35.470 --> 1:05:40.475
[Caleb] Etan, free!

1:05:52.954 --> 1:05:55.123
Etan is good.

1:05:55.156 --> 1:05:56.826
Etan is great.

1:06:05.967 --> 1:06:09.738
We also thank thee for
blessing us with Mary.

1:06:13.174 --> 1:06:16.545
We know that it is you
El-Shalah who works through her,

1:06:17.947 --> 1:06:22.217
but without that vessel we could
not have reaped your bounty

1:06:22.250 --> 1:06:23.586
in all its glory.

1:06:25.721 --> 1:06:26.589
We thank thee.

1:06:27.523 --> 1:06:28.323
-Blessed be.
-Blessed be.

1:06:29.357 --> 1:06:31.627
-Blessed be.
-Blessed be.

1:06:32.528 --> 1:06:33.562
Eat up, child.

1:06:34.697 --> 1:06:36.966
It's time to stop
thinking as just one.

1:07:07.663 --> 1:07:12.100
It occurs to me that with
Caleb atoning for his sins,

1:07:13.268 --> 1:07:14.870
we have a bed free.

1:07:16.872 --> 1:07:19.440
Go to the children's
quarters Mary.

1:07:23.244 --> 1:07:24.479
I'll be right behind you.

1:07:44.299 --> 1:07:46.001
Go ahead, Mary.

1:07:46.035 --> 1:07:48.236
The bed is yours
while Caleb repents.

1:08:00.616 --> 1:08:01.650
Thank thee, Mother.

1:08:07.488 --> 1:08:10.258
Etan has smiled upon us.

1:08:10.291 --> 1:08:11.994
A true blessing indeed.

1:08:15.064 --> 1:08:20.069
But know this. What
Etan gives, he can take.

1:08:24.172 --> 1:08:27.241
Now is the time to be
more faithful than ever.

1:08:28.978 --> 1:08:29.912
Yes, Mother.

1:08:40.055 --> 1:08:41.389
Sleep well, my dears.

1:08:53.334 --> 1:08:58.339
-[Caleb shouting]
-[thunder rumbling]

1:09:01.076 --> 1:09:02.443
He's gonna die out there.

1:09:07.783 --> 1:09:12.554
Will they ever bring him inside?

1:09:12.588 --> 1:09:14.690
When it has been decided

1:09:14.723 --> 1:09:16.759
that one has to be
punished by Etan.

1:09:19.995 --> 1:09:21.997
There is little one
can do to atone.

1:09:24.432 --> 1:09:27.569
I fear his fate will be the
same as our brother, Elijah.

1:09:30.271 --> 1:09:31.607
[Mary] Elijah?

1:09:35.577 --> 1:09:38.346
There was once a
member of our family.

1:09:41.817 --> 1:09:42.985
A boy, Elijah.

1:09:47.523 --> 1:09:51.527
In Father's teachings,
he found words of peace.

1:09:54.462 --> 1:09:59.467
He found salvation, but not
through force and ritual,

1:10:02.771 --> 1:10:03.605
but through love.

1:10:07.009 --> 1:10:11.747
I truly believed my father
saw his connection to Etan.

1:10:15.216 --> 1:10:16.952
I believe he grew jealous of it.

1:10:21.289 --> 1:10:24.560
Man doing it for mankind
seems so far from destiny.

1:10:27.462 --> 1:10:31.232
It seems it is in need,

1:10:34.169 --> 1:10:36.004
for control and power.

1:10:41.210 --> 1:10:45.114
And I wonder how is it the
same scripture that both

1:10:46.782 --> 1:10:48.183
he and my Father read.

1:10:50.185 --> 1:10:52.988
It is written that as long
as they watch over us,

1:10:54.123 --> 1:10:55.256
we are to adorn them.

1:10:56.625 --> 1:11:01.329
Sometimes, he cannot
reconcile the word of Etan.

1:11:08.469 --> 1:11:11.240
I don't know what
Caleb has done,

1:11:14.610 --> 1:11:16.845
but that's my brother
laying there dying.

1:11:19.347 --> 1:11:20.816
My soul is split.

1:11:25.120 --> 1:11:28.757
I want to follow, to stay true.

1:11:33.427 --> 1:11:36.430
But I fear Father
needs us as strength.

1:11:39.635 --> 1:11:41.870
How could they be so wrong?

1:11:44.438 --> 1:11:46.074
They're my creators.

1:11:50.078 --> 1:11:52.714
The ones who have shown me Etan.

1:11:57.152 --> 1:12:00.155
And if they were
not your creators?

1:12:11.567 --> 1:12:15.336
I would see to it
that they were cold,

1:12:16.205 --> 1:12:18.307
and buried in the ground.

1:12:33.856 --> 1:12:36.859
Fear not brother,
for I am with you.

1:12:58.113 --> 1:13:00.849
[dramatic music]

1:13:07.256 --> 1:13:09.191
Children, to shelter.

1:13:14.696 --> 1:13:15.496
Go!

1:13:15.530 --> 1:13:16.665
Hurry.

1:13:16.698 --> 1:13:18.867
I'll rescue Caleb.

1:13:18.901 --> 1:13:23.105
Hurry child for Abaddon
is near and has no mercy,

1:13:23.138 --> 1:13:24.405
for the children of Etan.

1:13:29.912 --> 1:13:31.013
Pray with me, child.

1:13:32.347 --> 1:13:33.782
Lest thou will be swept away.

1:13:33.815 --> 1:13:35.651
Thou knows not what Etan wants.

1:13:35.684 --> 1:13:38.020
But you do and you give Abaddon.

1:13:38.053 --> 1:13:40.689
How dare thou speak
such blasphemy?

1:13:41.823 --> 1:13:44.293
Abaddon plays tricks
with your mind, my son.

1:13:44.326 --> 1:13:47.129
You see what he
wants you to see.

1:13:47.162 --> 1:13:48.363
Liar.

1:13:48.397 --> 1:13:51.566
There are no dark
angels outside.

1:13:51.600 --> 1:13:53.635
You want to see
Abaddon's angels?

1:13:53.669 --> 1:13:54.502
Do you?

1:13:56.171 --> 1:13:59.942
Speak, say one word, and I
will protect thee no longer,

1:13:59.975 --> 1:14:02.010
and leave thee
thy known devices.

1:14:04.313 --> 1:14:06.848
You will respect and
honor your father.

1:14:06.882 --> 1:14:09.318
Or you will meet thine end.

1:14:13.288 --> 1:14:16.758
Do you repent for the sins
that you have committed?

1:14:16.792 --> 1:14:20.662
For the evil thoughts that move
from your mind to your soul.

1:14:22.197 --> 1:14:24.900
And you ask for forgiveness
from the savior who demands

1:14:24.933 --> 1:14:26.835
that you honor your
father and mother,

1:14:26.868 --> 1:14:28.203
and do all that they ask.

1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:32.874
Yes.

1:14:39.614 --> 1:14:43.051
Let us begin the
path back to Etan.

1:14:50.092 --> 1:14:50.993
Blessed be.

1:14:59.801 --> 1:15:04.773
He will come to thee in time,
son, if it is believed to be.

1:15:23.959 --> 1:15:24.793
Wake up.

1:15:27.162 --> 1:15:28.864
We believe that
you're ready to join

1:15:28.897 --> 1:15:30.198
the good graces of Etan.

1:15:32.501 --> 1:15:34.102
Are you?

1:15:34.136 --> 1:15:39.141
[Caleb] Yes, yes.

1:15:55.490 --> 1:15:59.661
El-Shalah have come on
to me and he hath said,

1:15:59.694 --> 1:16:04.299
"Allow thy son, Caleb,
to repent his sins.

1:16:05.333 --> 1:16:09.471
"Let him sacrifice, so you
know his love be true."

1:16:13.408 --> 1:16:15.010
Caleb, do you ask
for forgiveness

1:16:15.043 --> 1:16:18.046
as we all bear witness
in this house?

1:16:19.815 --> 1:16:21.183
Yes, yes.

1:16:23.251 --> 1:16:26.688
Then unto thee I say,
Etan has been so gracious

1:16:26.721 --> 1:16:29.491
he allows it through the
blood of thy brother!

1:16:29.525 --> 1:16:30.358
Elijah!

1:16:31.626 --> 1:16:33.195
No!

1:16:33.228 --> 1:16:34.329
-No!
-Easy, child.

1:16:34.362 --> 1:16:36.298
This is not your fight.

1:16:39.000 --> 1:16:41.770
Etan has come to me and
said it is my sacrifice

1:16:41.803 --> 1:16:44.372
to slay my youngest son.

1:16:44.406 --> 1:16:47.175
And as my eldest, you
will make the sacrifice

1:16:47.209 --> 1:16:48.944
of thy father's word.

1:16:48.977 --> 1:16:51.079
El-Shalah has blessed us both.

1:16:51.113 --> 1:16:53.583
But did Etan not spare his son,

1:16:53.615 --> 1:16:56.218
and send a sacrificial
lamb instead?

1:16:58.086 --> 1:16:59.522
[grunts]

1:16:59.555 --> 1:17:04.025
If Etan desires a sacrificial
lamb, he will provide one.

1:17:04.059 --> 1:17:06.228
But thou seest no lamb.

1:17:08.930 --> 1:17:11.933
You will be lest you
wish to see the death

1:17:11.967 --> 1:17:13.668
of all those you hold dear.

1:17:15.103 --> 1:17:19.407
Do as you're told or watch
as I smite your loved ones.

1:17:19.441 --> 1:17:20.842
Come now.

1:17:20.876 --> 1:17:23.245
Choose the path to El-Shalah,
let him welcome you back

1:17:23.278 --> 1:17:24.646
to his good graces.

1:17:26.848 --> 1:17:29.552
For he hath heard.

1:17:32.087 --> 1:17:33.655
Brother I am free--

1:17:35.757 --> 1:17:40.028
Please forgive me, please
forgive me, please.

1:17:40.061 --> 1:17:41.062
I am free.

1:17:44.766 --> 1:17:47.235
[grunting]

1:17:47.269 --> 1:17:48.370
Elijah!

1:17:48.403 --> 1:17:49.471
No!

1:17:49.504 --> 1:17:50.540
No!

1:17:50.573 --> 1:17:51.473
Ow!

1:17:51.507 --> 1:17:52.642
Stop!

1:17:52.674 --> 1:17:57.580
-Etan commands thee!
-[dramatic music]

1:18:10.560 --> 1:18:15.163
Abigail, please,
please come back to us.

1:18:16.831 --> 1:18:19.734
The night has been
hard on you, poor girl.

1:18:21.436 --> 1:18:25.073
Come, my dear, you'll catch
your death in this cold.

1:18:26.474 --> 1:18:29.311
It is only the salvation
of your soul that prods us.

1:18:31.279 --> 1:18:32.380
Nothing more.

1:18:35.317 --> 1:18:36.151
Abigail!

1:18:39.487 --> 1:18:43.792
-[gunshot fires]
-Sinner!

1:18:43.825 --> 1:18:45.695
I see it now.

1:18:45.760 --> 1:18:47.729
Abaddon fills thy spirit.

1:18:47.762 --> 1:18:51.166
Thy veins and vessels are
washed with his bloodlust.

1:18:51.199 --> 1:18:53.168
You have turned your back
on Etan and therefore,

1:18:53.201 --> 1:18:56.471
bear no protection from
his loving embrace.

1:18:56.504 --> 1:18:59.874
To him, you are no more
than a shameful witch

1:18:59.908 --> 1:19:01.743
leading Abaddon's army.

1:19:01.776 --> 1:19:03.144
No!

1:19:03.178 --> 1:19:06.281
It is you who is the
sinner, who leads us astray,

1:19:06.314 --> 1:19:07.749
I see it now.

1:19:07.782 --> 1:19:11.520
You are nothing but a hateful
old man who wrongly sees

1:19:11.554 --> 1:19:13.556
himself as righteous.

1:19:13.589 --> 1:19:15.056
He won't fall for this.

1:19:15.558 --> 1:19:17.058
He will see to it.

1:19:22.764 --> 1:19:25.800
If those are thy
last words, so be it.

1:19:26.968 --> 1:19:30.640
I know in time I will
answer for my failings,

1:19:30.673 --> 1:19:32.742
but he knows I did try.

1:19:35.210 --> 1:19:37.445
No, no, please no.

1:19:37.479 --> 1:19:40.415
Please, please, I... I see it is

1:19:40.448 --> 1:19:42.851
I who cast a veil
upon this family.

1:19:42.884 --> 1:19:45.655
It was upon my arrival
that this all began.

1:19:45.688 --> 1:19:48.957
It allowed for Abaddon to
creep into our existence.

1:19:51.560 --> 1:19:55.230
Allow me to sacrifice myself
in my sister's stead--

1:19:55.263 --> 1:19:58.033
Come, girl, this is no
time to be righteous.

1:19:58.066 --> 1:19:59.501
Come now.

1:19:59.535 --> 1:20:02.738
If El-Shalah speaks to her,
who are we to interfere?

1:20:02.772 --> 1:20:04.172
Shut your mouth.

1:20:05.307 --> 1:20:07.576
If Etan speaks to you,
then let it be so.

1:20:11.279 --> 1:20:12.113
No.

1:20:17.520 --> 1:20:21.890
It seemed that El-Shalah
has plans for thee yet.

1:20:24.660 --> 1:20:27.495
Let it be known that most
don't get another chance.

1:20:35.937 --> 1:20:37.005
Stay here.

1:20:39.575 --> 1:20:44.145
You were supposed to be their
leader, their protector,

1:20:44.179 --> 1:20:47.015
to guide them along the
path of the righteous.

1:20:47.048 --> 1:20:51.386
Instead, you have lead your
brother to eternal darkness.

1:20:51.419 --> 1:20:55.457
You will remain here isolated
until you have returned

1:20:55.490 --> 1:20:56.424
your heart to him.

1:20:57.859 --> 1:21:01.029
And if you do not find your
path back to the light,

1:21:01.062 --> 1:21:05.568
we will have need to make
more sacrifices for your sins.

1:21:08.136 --> 1:21:11.607
Let thy brother's
death stay in thy soul.

1:21:12.974 --> 1:21:15.578
And may forever
on thy conscience.

1:21:23.786 --> 1:21:26.454
[Caleb sobbing]

1:21:37.600 --> 1:21:39.067
We can't go on like this.

1:21:43.639 --> 1:21:47.375
Oh merciful, Etan,
please spare my sister,

1:21:47.409 --> 1:21:50.178
-rid her of her wicked ways.
-Stop it!

1:21:50.211 --> 1:21:52.748
You are not my sister.

1:21:52.782 --> 1:21:54.884
You were dragged here,
do you not remember?

1:21:56.384 --> 1:21:59.722
I remember the mercy, the
reckoning, the day my soul

1:21:59.755 --> 1:22:01.389
was born anew one to thy family.

1:22:04.058 --> 1:22:06.494
It was you who said
to hold our tongues,

1:22:06.529 --> 1:22:09.030
and we would be safe, that
we must stay obedient.

1:22:10.165 --> 1:22:12.568
Maybe if your brother
had done the same,

1:22:12.601 --> 1:22:14.436
he could have avoided his fate.

1:22:17.873 --> 1:22:20.475
[Mary screams]

1:22:22.845 --> 1:22:24.946
Etan is merciful.

1:22:24.979 --> 1:22:27.348
His teachings are in
kindness and forgiveness.

1:22:27.382 --> 1:22:28.950
That was not mercy.

1:22:30.051 --> 1:22:31.687
That was Abaddon
working through them.

1:22:31.720 --> 1:22:34.489
They do not walk with
El-Shalah anymore.

1:22:39.461 --> 1:22:42.497
How could you so quickly
be turned into their spell?

1:22:44.299 --> 1:22:46.034
It was mere months
ago you arrived.

1:22:48.269 --> 1:22:50.972
I have known Etan's teachings
my whole life, too.

1:22:53.709 --> 1:22:57.178
It's all Father taught
me since I was young.

1:22:57.212 --> 1:22:58.413
Since you were young?

1:23:07.623 --> 1:23:08.791
We need to go.

1:23:13.027 --> 1:23:15.664
I do not know what we will find,

1:23:18.266 --> 1:23:22.070
but I promise it will
be far better than here.

1:23:33.081 --> 1:23:35.016
Caleb, can you hear me?

1:23:45.594 --> 1:23:47.395
The door's locked.

1:23:47.428 --> 1:23:49.732
[Caleb] Go, leave me.

1:23:49.765 --> 1:23:53.201
No, I will never leave you.

1:23:54.302 --> 1:23:57.806
[Caleb] I died in
that room with Elijah.

1:24:03.646 --> 1:24:05.480
We will go get help.

1:24:06.447 --> 1:24:08.283
I will return for you.

1:24:10.519 --> 1:24:13.756
If Etan is just, he
will grant me that.

1:24:21.229 --> 1:24:24.065
[dramatic music]

1:24:27.570 --> 1:24:29.605
[Father] Years have
gone without mishap,

1:24:29.638 --> 1:24:31.640
and now you defy
me because of what?

1:24:31.674 --> 1:24:32.875
Jealousy?

1:24:32.908 --> 1:24:35.044
[Mother] Who art
thou to judge me?

1:24:35.076 --> 1:24:38.279
We have lost our flock,
and only you to blame.

1:24:38.313 --> 1:24:40.381
[Father] Dare your
raise your hand at me!

1:24:40.415 --> 1:24:41.584
[Mother] Tell me now.

1:24:41.617 --> 1:24:42.818
Am I done with thee?

1:24:42.851 --> 1:24:45.086
That bastard's son, the
lord needs you to beat

1:24:45.119 --> 1:24:47.056
the sin from him.

1:24:47.088 --> 1:24:51.927
Speak now for a long night
of punishment awaits.

1:24:51.961 --> 1:24:54.530
[Father] We will see to it.

1:24:54.563 --> 1:24:56.999
But we are not finished here.

1:25:02.403 --> 1:25:05.239
[dramatic music]

1:25:23.926 --> 1:25:25.393
Let us turn back.

1:25:25.426 --> 1:25:28.097
Father will surely
forgive us if we repent.

1:25:28.129 --> 1:25:31.399
Look, there is nothing
to be afraid of.

1:25:40.308 --> 1:25:43.812
See, Etan blesses this
land as much as any.

1:25:50.886 --> 1:25:52.721
Eve, we have to hurry.

1:25:55.423 --> 1:25:56.925
Eve!

1:25:56.959 --> 1:25:57.793
Eve!

1:26:02.831 --> 1:26:05.067
Hurry, we will be back for her.

1:26:16.244 --> 1:26:18.580
I cannot go back in there.

1:26:20.716 --> 1:26:21.550
Mary,

1:26:24.086 --> 1:26:25.988
where do you come from?

1:26:40.769 --> 1:26:41.603
Aah!

1:28:22.436 --> 1:28:25.507
I will never let
anyone hurt you again.

1:28:26.374 --> 1:28:27.408
Do you hear me?

1:28:33.549 --> 1:28:34.382
You stay here.

1:28:35.884 --> 1:28:37.820
I cannot abide by this.

1:28:39.888 --> 1:28:40.722
No!

1:28:42.891 --> 1:28:45.727
[dramatic music]

1:28:57.172 --> 1:29:00.943
[Mother] Etan give us the
strength to carry out your will.

1:29:00.976 --> 1:29:02.443
[Father] Insolence!

1:29:02.476 --> 1:29:07.216
El-Shalah, may we honor you
with obedience and servitude.

1:29:07.249 --> 1:29:11.452
Etan, give us the strength
to carry out your will.

1:29:11.485 --> 1:29:16.225
El-Shalah, may we honor you
with obedience and servitude.

1:29:19.061 --> 1:29:22.698
Give us the strength
to carry out your will.

1:29:22.731 --> 1:29:27.468
El-Shalah, may we honor you
with obedience and servitude.

1:29:28.804 --> 1:29:30.639
Etan, give us the st--

1:29:36.410 --> 1:29:37.246
strength!

1:29:47.723 --> 1:29:49.457
What have you done?

1:29:50.525 --> 1:29:51.360
Wha--

1:30:08.944 --> 1:30:11.747
My child, reveal thyself.

1:30:11.780 --> 1:30:13.181
Thou has nothing to fear.

1:30:14.950 --> 1:30:19.187
Reveal yourself for El-Shalah
is merciful, as am I.

1:30:20.522 --> 1:30:24.126
Reveal yourself and
lessen your punishment.

1:31:00.362 --> 1:31:02.698
[screaming]

1:31:20.215 --> 1:31:22.250
Etan is my witness.

1:31:22.284 --> 1:31:24.953
I ask you to repent
your evil ways.

1:31:26.955 --> 1:31:30.625
El-Shalah, he doth
smile upon me.

1:31:31.893 --> 1:31:35.130
He knows my soul as
he does my intentions.

1:31:35.163 --> 1:31:36.598
Enough.

1:31:36.631 --> 1:31:39.735
Do not be afraid of those
who can kill the body,

1:31:39.768 --> 1:31:41.003
but cannot kill the soul.

1:31:42.437 --> 1:31:46.375
But be afraid of the one who
can destroy both the soul,

1:31:46.408 --> 1:31:48.143
and the body for eternity.

1:31:49.344 --> 1:31:50.145
Enough!

1:31:51.346 --> 1:31:54.783
El-Shalah I ask for
you to take this.

1:31:54.816 --> 1:31:57.019
For she who lays before me...

1:31:57.052 --> 1:31:59.187
[indiscernible speech]

1:31:59.221 --> 1:32:01.289
[sobbing]

1:32:08.030 --> 1:32:12.401
He promises to guide,
to leave no one behind.

1:32:12.434 --> 1:32:15.270
To bless us and
both to anoint us.

1:32:16.505 --> 1:32:19.775
[indiscernible speech]

1:32:26.014 --> 1:32:28.183
[sobbing]

1:32:35.857 --> 1:32:40.395
You professed in the open,
but denied them by your works.

1:32:40.429 --> 1:32:43.899
You are detestable,
unfit for any good work.

1:32:45.535 --> 1:32:48.503
You dare mock me in his house--

1:32:48.538 --> 1:32:51.106
I pity you.

1:32:51.139 --> 1:32:53.041
Who are you to pity me?

1:32:53.075 --> 1:32:56.611
I see you as doth he.

1:32:58.046 --> 1:33:02.884
I grow sad for your soul
and the eternal damnation

1:33:02.918 --> 1:33:03.919
that awaits thee.

1:33:06.154 --> 1:33:11.159
I saw your little cabin in
the woods where you kept Mary

1:33:13.061 --> 1:33:14.329
and fed upon her.

1:33:14.362 --> 1:33:16.566
You sick twisted man!

1:33:18.200 --> 1:33:19.034
You think you know the truth?

1:33:21.436 --> 1:33:24.306
I saved that girl's
soul from damnation

1:33:24.339 --> 1:33:29.344
just the same as I saved
yours and your brothers'.

1:33:30.779 --> 1:33:33.782
You know naught of the evils
that lurk outside these walls.

1:33:33.815 --> 1:33:36.885
The decadence and frivolity.

1:33:36.918 --> 1:33:39.154
You shant fight me.

1:33:39.187 --> 1:33:40.021
Twisted man!

1:33:41.857 --> 1:33:44.759
[inaudible speech]

1:33:57.105 --> 1:33:58.940
You think you're special?

1:34:00.275 --> 1:34:04.112
You're just one of
many, and many to come.

1:34:04.779 --> 1:34:07.249
[grunting]

1:34:07.282 --> 1:34:11.052
We must cut out the
boil to cure the wound.

1:34:20.729 --> 1:34:24.799
You say you speak the
word of El-Shalah,

1:34:24.833 --> 1:34:28.236
but you are
possessed by Abaddon.

1:34:28.270 --> 1:34:29.671
Enough, enough!

1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:33.609
You punished us,

1:34:34.876 --> 1:34:37.112
you molested us with your evil.

1:34:41.349 --> 1:34:44.252
Now it is your time
for punishment.

1:34:51.293 --> 1:34:54.963
You shall no longer speak
the word of El-Shalah.

1:34:58.166 --> 1:34:59.401
This ends here.

1:35:05.641 --> 1:35:08.310
[gunshot fires]

1:35:14.149 --> 1:35:16.484
Let thy blood

1:35:16.519 --> 1:35:20.623
stain the floor of this
unholy chapel.

1:35:24.359 --> 1:35:27.530
[Taking deep breaths]

1:35:29.565 --> 1:35:31.466
You need help, brother.

1:35:31.499 --> 1:35:35.503
-I will not let you die here.
-[dramatic music]

1:35:55.357 --> 1:35:57.192
Come on, stay with us.

1:36:01.930 --> 1:36:04.032
[grunts]

1:36:09.037 --> 1:36:11.306
Is he gonna be all right?

1:36:22.784 --> 1:36:24.886
[Caleb] No, no, no, no.

1:36:26.087 --> 1:36:27.523
No, no, no, no.

1:36:30.125 --> 1:36:31.727
We must keep going.

1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.603
Abigail, Abigail,

1:36:42.003 --> 1:36:43.338
oh, I love thee.

1:36:46.207 --> 1:36:48.843
I wish I could've
protected you better.

1:36:52.280 --> 1:36:53.448
But you did.

1:36:55.718 --> 1:36:57.952
If it weren't for you,
we would have been doomed

1:36:57.986 --> 1:36:59.220
to the secrets.

1:37:03.058 --> 1:37:05.795
You can just get
up, just get up.

1:37:08.363 --> 1:37:09.197
Come on.

1:37:10.533 --> 1:37:11.634
No, no, no.

1:37:13.536 --> 1:37:15.705
Just let me watch it burn.

1:37:20.375 --> 1:37:22.545
Just let me watch it burn.

1:37:29.851 --> 1:37:31.853
Doth brought a flower.

1:37:59.914 --> 1:38:02.518
[somber music]

1:38:11.192 --> 1:38:12.460
Come on.

1:38:12.494 --> 1:38:15.163
I promise no harm
will come to thee.

1:38:21.670 --> 1:38:24.272
[somber music]

1:38:36.317 --> 1:38:37.152
Run!

1:38:40.221 --> 1:38:42.991
[dramatic music]

1:38:48.831 --> 1:38:52.000
[helicopter whooshes]
