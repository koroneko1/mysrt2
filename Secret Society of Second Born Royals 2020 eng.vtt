about the princess

00:08.591 --> 00:11.094
waiting for some brave prince
to come and save her?

00:12.262 --> 00:14.806
Yeah, this is not that kind of a story.

00:14.889 --> 00:16.641
Meet Samantha.

00:16.725 --> 00:20.311
She's the second-born daughter
of the royal family of Illyria,

00:20.395 --> 00:22.022
the smallest country in Europe.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.274
See? That one right there.

00:24.816 --> 00:27.360
Sam, here,
has never been a typical princess.

00:27.444 --> 00:29.487
Unlike her older sister, Eleanor,

00:29.571 --> 00:32.240
who always seemed perfectly regal
in every way,

00:32.323 --> 00:34.242
Sam wasn't.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.618
[Eleanor screams]

00:35.702 --> 00:40.081
[man] Things got even tougher when, at age
five, she found out her father, the king,

00:40.790 --> 00:42.876
had died in a plane crash
with his brother.

00:43.543 --> 00:47.756
After that, Sam's mom took over the throne
and the job of running the country.

00:47.839 --> 00:48.715

00:48.798 --> 00:51.926

Eleanor, the rightful heir,

00:52.010 --> 00:54.637

and she'll become the Queen of Illyria.

00:56.681 --> 00:57.682

00:58.224 --> 01:01.895
[man] As for Sam, she's just never fit
into this royal world.

01:05.231 --> 01:09.152
She's like so many second-borns
just searching for her place.

01:10.236 --> 01:12.280
You see, Sam's destined for great things.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.865
She just doesn't know it yet.

01:15.200 --> 01:16.534
That's where I come in.

01:20.455 --> 01:23.708
But... we'll get there soon enough.

01:39.641 --> 01:40.642
[Sam] We're almost there.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.186
Good, 'cause this gear is not light.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.688
[Sam] Tell me about it.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.523
Hey, are you sure you wanna do this?

01:46.606 --> 01:48.608
-Last chance to turn back.
-[Sam] Of course I'm sure.

01:48.692 --> 01:50.568

01:51.277 --> 01:52.278
[boy] Come on.

01:52.946 --> 01:55.949
Do you know how many people
would kill to be royalty? I would.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.617
You so do not mean that.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.911
You can do whatever you want
with your life.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.205
You can just be yourself.

02:02.997 --> 02:05.667
My entire future is planned out for me.

to host cocktail parties

02:08.586 --> 02:11.965

and smile silently in the background.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.842
It's not me.

02:13.925 --> 02:15.802
I wanna do something that matters.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.345

They were caught in a mudslide, and I just
knew that I had to do something, you know?

05:16.608 --> 05:18.026
It wasn't a mudslide.

05:18.902 --> 05:22.739
It was a 7.0 earthquake
followed by a Category 4 hurricane.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.450
Yes, a hurricane that caused a mudslide.

05:25.533 --> 05:28.370
And, besides, I don't think it really
matters why the Haitians are suffering.

The point is that I'm there
to do something about it.

15:34.392 --> 15:35.518
Am I clear?

15:36.186 --> 15:37.812
Good. Go pack.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.523
-School starts...
-Tomorrow?

15:40.607 --> 15:41.524
[Sam on phone] I know.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.651
[Mike on phone] Guess I can't complain
about being grounded for the weekend.

15:43.735 --> 15:44.819
So much for our first gig.

15:44.903 --> 15:46.738
I will find a way to escape.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.948
-[knocks]
-Oh. I gotta go.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.867
The person of the year
just walked into my room.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.035
[Mike] Okay, bye.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.704
-I came to say goodbye.
-You mean good riddance?

15:55.622 --> 15:57.248
The next time we see each other--

15:57.332 --> 15:59.876
You'll be Queen.
Like you've always wanted.

16:01.670 --> 16:03.463
I wish you could be happy for me.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.131
[Sam] I want to.

16:05.674 --> 16:09.010
But I don't understand
how any of this can make you happy.

16:09.552 --> 16:11.221
Always being on display.

16:11.513 --> 16:14.265
Being told exactly how to be.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.350
We're royals.

16:16.309 --> 16:17.894
That's our job.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.564
I know it makes sense to you.

16:22.857 --> 16:24.484
It just never has for me.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.116
Maybe someday it will.

16:48.633 --> 16:50.927
[cell phone rings, beeps]

16:51.469 --> 16:52.470
[Inmate 34] Hello?

16:54.222 --> 16:55.348
I'm free.

16:56.182 --> 16:58.893
The apple was a very clever idea.

17:01.646 --> 17:02.897
Stick to the plan.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.317
Phase one begins tomorrow.

17:06.401 --> 17:07.402
[cell phone beeps]

17:27.213 --> 17:30.342
[man on PA] Summer school students,
please report to room 203.

17:39.809 --> 17:40.810
Hi, there.

17:42.228 --> 17:43.605
Uh, hi, there.

17:43.688 --> 17:44.939
Heard you the first time.

17:45.023 --> 17:46.775
Oh, I wasn't sure.

17:46.858 --> 17:49.444
I'm January.
I'm Palace School back in Luxembourg.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.946
Just here for the extra credit.
You must be Sam.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.656
Our royal families go way back.

17:53.740 --> 17:57.077
My dad was friends with your uncle.
I heard Strathmore is the best.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.161
It sucks.

17:58.912 --> 17:59.954
You'll love it.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.581
Uh, thanks, I guess.

18:02.749 --> 18:04.459
-So...
-Look, June--

18:04.542 --> 18:06.419
-January.
-[Sam] Whatever.

18:06.503 --> 18:10.507
You seem like a perfectly typical princess
who's genuinely excited to be here.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.718
I just figured since we were
the only two people in the class...

18:13.802 --> 18:14.969
[clears throat]

18:15.762 --> 18:17.972
Oh, hi. I didn't notice you.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.100
-I'm January, this is--
-Sam.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.518
I'm Matteo.

18:22.519 --> 18:23.520
Nice to meet you--

18:23.603 --> 18:25.480
[boy 2] What's up, breakfast club?

18:25.563 --> 18:28.400
So, this is Strathmore?
My fourth school in three months.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.777
Bad news, you're stuck here.

18:31.486 --> 18:33.154
Good news, you're stuck here with me.

18:34.155 --> 18:36.199
How exactly is that "good news"?

18:36.282 --> 18:37.659
'Cause I bring the party, Joan of Dark.

18:37.742 --> 18:38.993
Drop dead, Fresh Prince.

18:39.077 --> 18:42.080
[chuckling] It's all right. She'll come
around. I tend to grow on people.

18:42.163 --> 18:43.498
-Like fungus?
-Yeah.

18:43.581 --> 18:46.209
[Roxana sighs]
It's so good to see you guys.

18:46.292 --> 18:48.503
All 108 million of you.

18:49.170 --> 18:53.299
Thank you, Evil Kitten, and no, I'm not
looking forward to summer school either.

18:53.383 --> 18:54.384
But I am a survivor.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.386
Just like Beyoncé. [chuckles]

18:56.469 --> 18:58.013
Right, gotta run. Loves.

18:59.514 --> 19:00.890
I can't believe this is happening.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.434
Fourteen days of unexcused absence.

19:02.517 --> 19:04.811
I mean,
I Skyped in every day from Coachella.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.105
[sighs]

19:07.188 --> 19:10.567
I didn't know you could be sent to
summer school for having no fashion sense.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.235
-Go mute yourself.
-Ouch.

19:13.028 --> 19:15.655
[January] Hi, Roxana.
I'm a really big fan.

19:15.739 --> 19:18.283
I'm January, and I can't wait
to get to know all of you better.

19:18.366 --> 19:19.743
Well, I'll give you the CliffsNotes.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.661
She's the most annoying person in school,

19:21.745 --> 19:24.998
and Prince Tuma over here,
is a total jerk.

19:25.081 --> 19:27.792
He dated my BFF,
and all he cares about is himself.

19:27.876 --> 19:29.544
And all you care about
is what filter you use.

19:29.627 --> 19:31.796
I've always been no filter,
and everyone knows that.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.299
Where's the rest of the class?
There can't only be four of us.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.217
-Five.
-[man] Good morning, class.

19:36.301 --> 19:39.304
My name's Mr. Morrow,
but you can call me James.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.848
[James narrating] Yup, this is me.
Your loyal royal narrator.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.767
[chuckles] I bet you were wondering
when I'd show up.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.101
Little bit about me.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.896
I have a boyfriend named Henry,
an iguana named Jeff,

19:47.979 --> 19:49.773
and a severe gluten allergy.

19:49.856 --> 19:52.359
Seriously, give me a bagel
and I'm as good as dead.

19:52.817 --> 19:55.528
We are going to have fun this summer.

19:55.612 --> 19:57.572
Oh, God. We got the "cool teacher."

19:57.655 --> 19:59.449
Thank you.
No one's ever called me cool before.

20:00.450 --> 20:02.786
This ain't my first rodeo.
You guys are in good hands.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.913
He definitely wasn't the cool teacher.
[chuckles]

20:04.996 --> 20:07.665
Quick question for you.
Why do you think you're here?

20:07.749 --> 20:09.292
Oh, well, I threw a party.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.835
That doesn't sound bad.

20:10.919 --> 20:12.837
In the chem lab,
burned down half the school.

20:12.921 --> 20:14.381
-It wasn't my fault.
-[James] Incorrect.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.424
Prince Matteo, same question.

20:16.508 --> 20:17.592
[Matteo] Um...

20:17.676 --> 20:19.803
My parents got a letter from school.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.972
My social skills are a bit lacking.

20:23.431 --> 20:26.142
The principal thought
a smaller class might help.

20:26.226 --> 20:28.520
Also, incorrect. Princess Samantha.

20:28.603 --> 20:29.854
It's Sam,

20:29.938 --> 20:32.315
and I'm pretty sure anything I say
is gonna be wrong.

20:33.191 --> 20:35.610
Now, that is correct.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.571
The reasons all of you
were sent to "summer school"

20:38.655 --> 20:42.409
were cover-up stories to get you
all here without arousing suspicion.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.703
Oh! [chuckles]

20:44.786 --> 20:45.704
I get it.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.748
I'm on a reality TV show.

20:49.708 --> 20:50.709
Are you the host?

20:51.209 --> 20:53.169
Oh, no. Gosh. That's the dream, though.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.296
But, alas, I'm a prince.

20:55.380 --> 20:57.465
A second-born royal, just like you guys.

20:57.549 --> 21:01.845
Our siblings are the heirs, we the spares.

21:02.637 --> 21:03.596
Powerless.

21:04.014 --> 21:05.015
Without purpose...

21:06.099 --> 21:07.767
or so everyone thinks.

21:10.895 --> 21:12.355
[chuckling] Dude, you're a hologram.

21:12.439 --> 21:15.108
They had one of Celine Dion performing
at my cousin's knighting ceremony.

21:15.191 --> 21:17.777
Maybe it's a twin brother?

21:24.117 --> 21:25.577
[James] Okay, here's the deal.

21:25.660 --> 21:29.539
There's a special gene exclusive
to second-borns of royal bloodlines.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.375
A gene that gives some of us
extraordinary abilities

21:32.459 --> 21:34.294
that manifest at your age.

21:37.047 --> 21:38.381
You guys have superpowers.

21:38.882 --> 21:41.676
Your abilities are unique to you alone.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.262
That is why you're here,

21:44.346 --> 21:46.389
to harness your untapped potential,

21:47.265 --> 21:52.645
which you will use as members of
the Secret Society of Second-Born Royals.

21:57.025 --> 21:58.276
It's a mouthful, we know.

21:59.194 --> 22:02.197
So... [sighs] we're superheroes?

22:02.781 --> 22:03.907
[James] That's correct.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.621
There is one catch, though.

22:10.580 --> 22:13.792
Nobody, even your family,
can know we exist.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.960
I've had that superpower for years.

22:16.378 --> 22:17.420
Dude, so sad.

22:18.296 --> 22:20.340
Now, to protect our secrecy,

22:20.423 --> 22:23.343
I'm going to have to take
all of your phones.

22:24.260 --> 22:27.138
I'm so sorry to confiscate your phones

22:27.222 --> 22:30.642
for the immediate
and not so temporary future.

22:31.142 --> 22:33.311
When you say, "the immediate
and not so temporary future,"

22:33.395 --> 22:35.647
you don't mean, like,
the whole summer, right?

22:36.606 --> 22:40.610
The pain you're experiencing right now
will only make you stronger.

22:41.403 --> 22:44.447
So, James,
are you the head of the Society?

22:44.531 --> 22:45.824
[James] Not exactly.

22:45.907 --> 22:46.991
I am.

22:48.118 --> 22:49.119
Mom?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.706
Welcome to
the Secret Society training program.

22:53.665 --> 22:56.459
For thousands of years,
second-borns like you and myself

22:56.543 --> 23:01.131
have protected our kingdoms from threats,
assassins and international criminals.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.008
We work in secret.

23:03.508 --> 23:07.554
Our rewards? Lives saved. Order restored.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.515
The next six weeks will be challenging.

23:10.890 --> 23:12.559
You may doubt you have what it takes,

23:13.101 --> 23:17.313
but whatever obstacles you face,
nothing is impossible.

23:17.731 --> 23:20.316
Those of you who make the cut
will join the Society.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.236
Those who don't
will return to your kingdoms.

23:23.319 --> 23:25.113
You'll be stripped of your powers,

23:25.196 --> 23:28.867
and your memories will be modified to
erase any recollection of this training.

23:30.201 --> 23:31.578
I wish you the best of luck.

23:36.499 --> 23:37.500
[Sam] You lied to me.

23:38.251 --> 23:40.962
I withheld the truth.
There's a difference.

23:41.046 --> 23:42.672
Did Dad know? Does El?

23:42.756 --> 23:46.843
No, and she'll never know.
That's how we protect those we love.

23:48.219 --> 23:49.054
How?

23:50.221 --> 23:54.642
You long to be more than a princess,
this meaningless title you were born with.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.144
This is your chance.

23:58.980 --> 24:01.983
Go join the others and make me proud.

24:04.694 --> 24:05.695
[sighs]

24:08.656 --> 24:10.992
-[James] What did you tell her?
-[Catherine] What she needed to hear.

24:11.076 --> 24:12.410
Any news on the prison break?

24:13.244 --> 24:14.454
He had help.

24:14.537 --> 24:17.999
Every Society operative around the world
is out searching. We'll find him.

24:20.043 --> 24:23.380
[banging]

24:26.841 --> 24:28.301
[cell phone ringing]

24:30.095 --> 24:31.096
[cell phone beeps]

24:31.930 --> 24:33.181
Do you have something for me?

24:33.264 --> 24:35.517
[distorted voice on phone]
Not yet, but I'm working on it.

24:35.600 --> 24:39.479
Meanwhile, keep strengthening
your telekinesis. It's been a long time.

24:40.021 --> 24:43.358
I rotted in that cell Catherine put me in
for ten years...

24:44.025 --> 24:48.279
waiting to escape
while the world forgot I existed.

24:49.531 --> 24:52.450
Now I'm going to take everything from her.

24:53.785 --> 24:54.953
Ten years.

24:59.124 --> 25:00.125
[grunts]

25:20.437 --> 25:22.355
[James] Welcome, trainees.

25:22.439 --> 25:24.858
Now you're probably all wondering,
"What are my powers?"

25:24.941 --> 25:28.069
I'm wondering that myself,
but we will get to that.

25:28.153 --> 25:32.782
First, however, a little Secret Society
tradition for new trainees.

25:32.866 --> 25:36.745
You're gonna like it.
Actually, you might not like it.

25:36.828 --> 25:37.662
What's up?

25:37.746 --> 25:40.665
Does that involve push-ups?
I have a doctor's note for that.

25:41.833 --> 25:44.252
[chuckling] All right.
Yeah, you're definitely not gonna like it.

25:45.003 --> 25:46.004
[tablet beeps]

25:51.051 --> 25:54.137
[January] No way. This is amazing!

26:06.858 --> 26:10.278
Super basic. All you gotta do
is get from here to there.

26:10.362 --> 26:12.822
First person who gets the pyramid
wins the prize.

26:12.906 --> 26:14.741
That's it? [chuckles] Piece of cake.

26:15.867 --> 26:17.285
[groaning]

26:18.370 --> 26:20.789
Lesson one, expect the unexpected.

26:22.207 --> 26:24.709
Well, what are you waiting for,
a royal invitation? Let's go.

26:25.543 --> 26:26.753
FYI, the lasers hurt.

26:28.296 --> 26:29.297
[grunts]

26:31.591 --> 26:32.425
Whoop.

26:32.967 --> 26:35.053
-[January] I'm going to beat you.
-[Roxana] You wish.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.347
[James] Ah, you kids are really athletic.

26:37.847 --> 26:38.848
[grunts]

26:41.226 --> 26:42.227
[grunts]

26:44.479 --> 26:45.689
[screams, grunts]

26:47.524 --> 26:49.818
[screams, grunts]

26:50.193 --> 26:51.194
[groans]

26:52.070 --> 26:54.197
Ow, I chipped a nail.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.243
Guys, I just lost my thumb.
I text with my thumb.

26:58.326 --> 27:00.120
Oh, my God. I'm melting.

27:00.203 --> 27:02.956
-That's your power. Invisibility.
-A-plus.

27:03.039 --> 27:04.082
Can I have my legs back now?

27:04.165 --> 27:05.834
They're my second
most-commented-on feature.

27:05.917 --> 27:07.252
You just lost your bottom.

27:07.335 --> 27:09.754
Right, that's it. I'm out.

27:10.505 --> 27:11.548
[gasps, grunts]

27:12.465 --> 27:13.633
Hey, forget her. Help me up.

27:14.342 --> 27:15.176
Coming.

27:15.677 --> 27:16.511
So demanding.

27:17.345 --> 27:18.972
Figure out this course
and take me to the pyramid.

27:19.055 --> 27:20.890
[Sam] Why do I suddenly care so much
about helping you?

27:20.974 --> 27:21.891
Because I'm charming.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.226
Not to anyone with a pulse.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.189
Maybe that's his power? He tells people
what to do, and they listen.

27:29.190 --> 27:31.234
Fine.
Tell me your most embarrassing secret.

27:31.317 --> 27:32.402
I've never kissed anyone.

27:33.445 --> 27:36.197
You see, I'd never admit that.
He can make people do whatever he says.

27:36.281 --> 27:37.323
Greatest power ever.

27:40.076 --> 27:41.077
Duck!

27:41.453 --> 27:43.538
[grunts, groaning]

27:43.621 --> 27:46.374
Lesson two, be aware of your surroundings.

27:46.458 --> 27:49.836
It would be really useful
if you gave us the lessons beforehand.

27:49.919 --> 27:51.629
Well, that would kinda defeat
the whole purpose, wouldn't it?

27:51.713 --> 27:54.132
A word of warning,
the lasers are still shooting.

27:54.215 --> 27:55.216
[January] How did you know?

27:55.300 --> 27:57.635
I heard it. I have super senses.

27:58.470 --> 28:00.847
[insect buzzing]

28:00.930 --> 28:01.931
Whoa!

28:02.015 --> 28:04.017
-How did you do that?
-The laser bounced off the padding.

28:05.935 --> 28:07.187
-[grunts]
-[January gasps]

28:07.270 --> 28:08.104
Ow.

28:14.861 --> 28:16.613
[gasps, screams]

28:27.457 --> 28:28.458
[grunts]

28:28.958 --> 28:29.793
[grunts]

28:29.876 --> 28:33.296
[panting]

28:38.343 --> 28:40.136
[Roxana]
Can I have my cell phone back, please?

28:40.720 --> 28:42.972
-Well, that was a great success.
-[tablet beeps]

28:46.309 --> 28:48.228
[Roxana] Does anyone want to trade powers?

28:48.937 --> 28:52.190
Super senses for kind of invisibility?
I'm good.

28:53.525 --> 28:56.528
What about you, Matteo?
You're kind of invisible anyway.

28:57.028 --> 28:59.447
Sure. You can have my power
of being awkward

28:59.823 --> 29:01.074
'cause that's all I have right now.

29:01.157 --> 29:03.201
[insect buzzing]

29:03.284 --> 29:04.411
So many bugs.

29:04.494 --> 29:06.037
Maybe we're late bloomers.

29:06.121 --> 29:07.455
We just have to be patient.

29:07.539 --> 29:09.457
-Just like that story about the tortoise--
-Stop talking.

29:10.542 --> 29:11.668
Well, that was rude.

29:11.751 --> 29:14.921
I just wanted to see if it'll work.
And January was annoying me. [chuckles]

29:15.005 --> 29:17.382
Can you order yourself
to be less obnoxious?

29:17.465 --> 29:19.884
Hey, that was a joke. Come on.

29:19.968 --> 29:21.803
You don't have much
to freak out about, anyway.

29:22.345 --> 29:24.097
Your mom's the boss.
You're in no matter what.

29:24.180 --> 29:27.142
You seriously overestimate
my relationship with my mother.

29:27.225 --> 29:30.228
Oh, my God. Guys, you can see me, right?

29:30.311 --> 29:32.689
Everything except your face.

29:34.190 --> 29:35.859
What's wrong with my face?

29:37.277 --> 29:38.486
Where'd January go?

29:39.237 --> 29:40.238
Dunno.

29:40.697 --> 29:41.740
But I can see your face again.

29:41.823 --> 29:42.782
[chuckles]

29:43.533 --> 29:44.367
Hmm?

29:44.951 --> 29:46.911
It doesn't make sense.

29:46.995 --> 29:50.290
James said our powers are unique,
and we already have an invisible girl.

29:50.373 --> 29:51.249
Not anymore.

29:51.332 --> 29:52.334
-[slaps]
-Ow!

29:52.667 --> 29:53.793
Ugh, really?

29:53.877 --> 29:55.378
-You slapped me.
-You deserved it.

29:55.462 --> 29:56.379
Ooh, I can talk again.

29:56.463 --> 29:58.173
-Slap yourself.
-No, you slap yourself.

29:58.256 --> 30:00.091
-Ow!
-Why did you do that?

30:00.175 --> 30:01.134
She told me to do it.

30:01.217 --> 30:02.969
I'm so confused.

30:03.845 --> 30:07.849
When January touched Roxana,
she became invisible,

30:07.932 --> 30:11.603
and when she touched Tuma,
he did exactly what she told him to.

30:11.686 --> 30:13.646
So, whoever I touch last...

30:13.730 --> 30:16.733
You take away their power,
and it becomes yours.

30:17.359 --> 30:19.861
Great. Now I'm the only person
without a power.

30:20.570 --> 30:21.446
Typical.

30:21.529 --> 30:25.367
Hey, you're going to find your power too,
and it's gonna be awesome.

30:25.450 --> 30:26.451
[insect buzzing]

30:26.701 --> 30:28.745
Really think so?

30:28.828 --> 30:29.662
Yeah.

30:30.872 --> 30:31.873
Totally.

30:32.874 --> 30:35.877
I hope it's X-ray vision... or flying.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.338
Well, flying is involved.

30:39.047 --> 30:43.259
Hey, dude, your power's being
a bug magnet. You're Bug Man.

30:43.802 --> 30:45.303
[chuckles]

30:47.639 --> 30:50.266
There are, like, 100 rooms in here.

30:50.350 --> 30:52.477
Why do we all have to share the same one?

30:53.019 --> 30:54.521
I guess they want us to bond?

30:54.604 --> 30:56.481
Oh, great.
Let me know how that goes, yeah?

30:58.149 --> 30:59.150
Later.

31:01.820 --> 31:05.323
Oh, not too bad.
Hey, we can work with this.

31:05.407 --> 31:06.866
I guess we should choose our beds, right?

31:06.950 --> 31:08.410
-Hey, give me that bed.
-Okay.

31:08.493 --> 31:09.994
I love this power.

31:12.122 --> 31:13.123
Whoo.

31:14.416 --> 31:15.417
[chuckles]

31:16.918 --> 31:18.503
Did you have any idea you were different?

31:19.629 --> 31:20.797
Before today, I mean.

31:21.881 --> 31:23.675
[stammers] Yeah.

31:23.758 --> 31:26.594
About a year ago people started doing
the craziest things when I asked.

31:27.095 --> 31:31.016
I always thought it was because I was
super charming but now it all makes sense.

31:31.558 --> 31:32.559
How about you?

31:32.934 --> 31:33.852
I don't know.

31:34.436 --> 31:37.480
The last few months,
I've been getting a lot of bug bites.

31:37.564 --> 31:40.233
I didn't think much of it,
and no one else noticed, of course.

31:41.151 --> 31:42.610
One of the benefits of being invisible.

31:42.694 --> 31:44.487
Hey,
you're not invisible to invisible girl.

31:44.571 --> 31:46.740
I saw that butterfly she gave you.

31:47.323 --> 31:48.491
She'd never go for a guy like me.

31:48.575 --> 31:49.868
Never say never.

31:50.869 --> 31:53.788
Hey, you can have this bed if you want to.
I shouldn't have just--

31:53.872 --> 31:55.040
It's okay. This one's fine.

31:58.460 --> 32:01.629
But maybe next time
don't do that powers thing on me.

32:01.713 --> 32:04.299
Fair enough.
As long as you keep your bugs to yourself.

32:04.382 --> 32:05.216
Deal.

32:07.469 --> 32:08.803
Mind if I take the top?

32:10.513 --> 32:15.352
My twin brother always took the top bunk
when we were kids. He's the worst.

32:16.227 --> 32:18.229
He cheated on all of his finals.

32:18.730 --> 32:21.649
I'm genuinely worried about our country
if he's the one who's ruling it.

32:21.733 --> 32:25.904
He was born first by a minute,
so he gets the throne. So unfair.

32:25.987 --> 32:26.988
I hear you.

32:27.072 --> 32:28.573
Is your sister horrible too?

32:29.783 --> 32:33.119
Actually, no. She's perfect in every way.

32:33.203 --> 32:34.579
Being a second-born is bad enough,

32:34.662 --> 32:37.540
but when you always feel
like you're second place...

32:38.166 --> 32:39.584
It's not just that.

32:42.796 --> 32:45.840
It's constantly feeling
like I'm being compared to her

32:46.299 --> 32:49.135
or compared to how a princess should be.

32:50.679 --> 32:53.098
Like, we can't have our own identities.

32:54.391 --> 32:55.392
Exactly.

32:57.769 --> 32:59.562
[cell phone vibrating]

32:59.646 --> 33:01.189
[January] Backup phone. Smart.

33:01.856 --> 33:04.025
Don't worry, I can keep a secret.

33:29.968 --> 33:34.472
[James] Learning to use your powers is
all about focus, concentration, precision.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.896
Right now, your powers are being
controlled by hormones,

33:41.980 --> 33:46.067
stressful situations, peer pressure,
social anxiety, physical attraction,

33:46.151 --> 33:48.319
even loud music from an overrated band.

33:48.903 --> 33:50.905
Now that you know what your powers are,

33:50.989 --> 33:52.699
training is about learning
to control them.

33:52.782 --> 33:53.783
How do we do that?

33:54.826 --> 33:55.827
Practice.

33:57.412 --> 34:00.415
This test is designed
to help sharpen your super senses.

34:00.498 --> 34:02.584
Listen carefully to the voices.

34:03.418 --> 34:04.919
-Okay, pay attention.
-[voices from speakers]

34:05.003 --> 34:08.631
A little boy just told Santa
what he wants for Christmas. What is it?

34:08.715 --> 34:10.425
[young man]
Remember the last time we were here?

34:10.508 --> 34:11.843
-[young woman] Of course.
-Not socks?

34:11.926 --> 34:13.720
[doctor] The results are in.
Are you ready to find out?

34:13.803 --> 34:15.555
[student]
I just don't have a good feeling--

34:17.098 --> 34:19.476
The boy is asking for...

34:19.559 --> 34:20.643
[student 2] It's not a big deal.

34:20.727 --> 34:22.020
[student] I'm not going to cheat.

34:22.103 --> 34:24.230
Because he has the same answers
to the final every year.

34:24.314 --> 34:25.398
I don't know.

34:25.482 --> 34:28.068
"To learn to succeed,
you must first learn to fail."

34:29.361 --> 34:32.364
[voices continue]

34:34.908 --> 34:38.036
Prince Tuma, you have one of the more
unique powers I've ever seen.

34:38.119 --> 34:40.497
-Thanks.
-I understand you're quite the dog lover.

34:40.580 --> 34:43.875
Big time! I've got five purebreds
back at the palace and they love me.

34:43.958 --> 34:45.251
Glad you said that.

34:45.335 --> 34:47.796
Because your powers rely
on your interactions with others,

34:47.879 --> 34:48.880
you'll need a partner.

34:48.963 --> 34:49.964
Bring it.

34:50.048 --> 34:53.218
And seeing as no royal has ever been able
to train Charlie,

34:53.301 --> 34:56.346
we thought your unique skill set
could meet the challenge.

34:56.429 --> 34:57.430
Charlie?

34:57.514 --> 34:59.683
Prince Tuma, meet Charlie.

34:59.766 --> 35:00.809
[dog barking]

35:00.892 --> 35:04.521
If you can get him to obey your orders,
you can get anyone to follow your command.

35:07.190 --> 35:10.318
What, what do I have to practice?
Isn't my power borrowing someone else's?

35:10.402 --> 35:13.113
Yes, but you need to learn how
to do it for more than a few seconds.

35:13.196 --> 35:15.949
We're gonna work on getting you
to keep them for as long as necessary.

35:16.408 --> 35:17.409
In a pool?

35:18.493 --> 35:20.078
I wanna introduce you to someone.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.372
She is gonna help you with your training.

35:23.123 --> 35:24.499
Pleasure to meet you.

35:24.582 --> 35:27.877
I'm Princess Anna of Spain.
My power is breathing underwater.

35:28.461 --> 35:29.462
And now it's yours.

35:30.213 --> 35:31.756
-Good luck.
-[January screams]

35:36.636 --> 35:37.637
[coughs]

35:38.555 --> 35:39.556
Ready?

35:42.267 --> 35:45.520
-[insects buzzing]
-Come on. Lift it.

35:45.603 --> 35:47.605
[James]
Insects aren't just drawn to you, Matteo.

35:47.689 --> 35:49.107
You can also control them.

35:52.694 --> 35:55.113
-[buzzing continues]
-[Matteo grunts]

35:57.282 --> 35:58.116
[grunts]

35:58.867 --> 36:00.493
-[groans]
-[sighs]

36:00.577 --> 36:02.120
I love that you get me, James.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.706
Honestly, I've been so missing
my Karma cycle class,

36:04.789 --> 36:07.125
but, you know, I wasn't about to complain.

36:07.876 --> 36:08.793
Oh, what's that?

36:08.877 --> 36:10.253
[James on intercom]
Solar flare simulation.

36:10.337 --> 36:12.339
Agents must be prepared
to deploy year-round,

36:12.422 --> 36:14.549
bearing the coldest of winters
to the hottest of summers.

36:14.632 --> 36:17.344
That artificial sun is scrumpt--

36:17.969 --> 36:21.139
Do you reckon I can still tan
whilst I'm invisible?

36:22.807 --> 36:23.892
[beeps]

36:23.975 --> 36:24.976
Oi.

36:25.435 --> 36:27.145
That's a bit cold. [chuckles]

36:29.356 --> 36:30.690
Ah, goggles. Wise choice.

36:30.774 --> 36:31.691
[beeps]

36:33.026 --> 36:34.861
Oh. Oh.

36:34.944 --> 36:38.823
All right, James. I get it.
We're ready year-round.

36:38.907 --> 36:41.910
All seasons. Please push stop.

36:41.993 --> 36:44.371
You disappear, I turn it off.

36:44.454 --> 36:46.956
Gosh, that's so annoying.
Why can't I disappear?

36:47.040 --> 36:48.083
[grunts]

36:48.750 --> 36:49.584
[huffs]

36:49.668 --> 36:51.169
[voices from speakers]

36:51.252 --> 36:52.671
[young man]
Remember the last time we were here?

36:55.465 --> 36:57.384
[Roxana sighs] I'm so over this.

36:57.467 --> 36:59.302
Hey! You've got the power of persuasion.

36:59.386 --> 37:02.055
Surely you can compel James
to return my phone.

37:02.138 --> 37:05.350
Your fans won't care
if you don't post for 48 hours.

37:05.433 --> 37:08.103
I've an image to maintain.
A responsibility.

37:08.186 --> 37:09.604
What about serving your kingdom?

37:09.688 --> 37:11.773
Firsties are the ones
with all the responsibility.

37:11.856 --> 37:14.025
Whole point of being us is hakuna matata.

37:15.151 --> 37:17.028
Hey, you're not the one
who has to spend their summer

37:17.112 --> 37:18.822
running away from man's best friend.

37:18.905 --> 37:20.657
Okay, kids, lunch is up.

37:22.450 --> 37:23.451
Sam.

37:26.496 --> 37:28.123
[sniffs]

37:29.207 --> 37:30.625
This smells toxic.

37:31.543 --> 37:35.213
Relax. Only Sam's was poisoned.
She needs the practice.

37:36.506 --> 37:38.842
Everything is a test. Everything.

37:38.925 --> 37:40.510
[Tuma] Dang. That's cold.

37:42.095 --> 37:43.096
[sighs]

37:43.179 --> 37:45.598
Here. We can share.

37:46.224 --> 37:47.809
Red apples are my favorite.

37:48.852 --> 37:49.936
Thanks.

37:55.775 --> 37:56.901
I just realized something.

37:59.112 --> 38:02.657
I've never had lunch with other kids
at Strathmore before.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.620
[barking dog approaching]

38:07.704 --> 38:10.290
All right, I'm out. Time to train.

38:11.833 --> 38:13.918
-Hey, come on, Charlie.
-[Charlie barks]

38:14.002 --> 38:15.628
-[Matteo] Oh!
-[Tuma] Come on, boy.

38:16.504 --> 38:18.006
[Roxana chuckles]

38:18.089 --> 38:20.091
[insect buzzing]

38:20.175 --> 38:21.259
[buzzing stops]

38:22.177 --> 38:24.220
I'm gonna get malaria and die.

38:24.304 --> 38:25.805
-No, you're not.
-You might.

38:25.889 --> 38:26.890
Yeah, actually, you might.

38:29.684 --> 38:30.685
[phone vibrating]

38:33.146 --> 38:36.107
-Hey.
-Hey. Sorry I've been MIA.

38:36.191 --> 38:37.692
How's it going? What class are you taking?

38:38.109 --> 38:39.611
You know, the ushe.

38:40.945 --> 38:42.113
How's your summer going?

38:42.781 --> 38:44.366
Well, not as much fun without you,

38:44.449 --> 38:46.951
but it's gonna be awesome.
I printed out the fliers for our gig.

38:48.411 --> 38:49.621
-[shutter clicks]
-[phone chimes]

38:53.208 --> 38:54.250
Can't wait.

38:55.210 --> 38:56.294
I gotta go.

38:56.378 --> 38:58.213
Yeah, okay. Uh...

38:59.047 --> 38:59.964
Good night.

39:02.425 --> 39:03.426
Good night.

39:07.764 --> 39:09.015
Hey, those look great.

39:09.099 --> 39:10.058
Thanks.

39:13.103 --> 39:16.523
You know, I've been working
for royals my entire life.

39:16.606 --> 39:18.274
They live in their own world.

39:18.775 --> 39:22.028
I'm just worried that someday
she's gonna forget about you and move on.

39:22.112 --> 39:23.405
I don't want to see you get hurt.

39:24.364 --> 39:25.365
Sam's not like that, Dad.

39:26.658 --> 39:27.951
She's my best friend.

39:49.931 --> 39:52.058
Hey, James. You wanted to see me?

39:52.142 --> 39:53.309
Mom?

39:54.853 --> 39:56.730
[breathes heavily]

39:56.813 --> 39:58.565
Teleportation?

39:58.648 --> 40:00.233
-That's your power?
-Mm-hmm.

40:00.817 --> 40:02.277
Next time call me a Lyft.

40:02.360 --> 40:03.778
James said you're struggling.

40:12.787 --> 40:14.664
Epsilon 97 red Q zero.

40:14.748 --> 40:15.957
[beeps]

40:18.251 --> 40:20.670
I'm guessing
that's not your Wi-Fi password.

40:21.254 --> 40:24.466
Royal master code.
Opens every door in the palace.

40:24.549 --> 40:26.343
Overrides any security measure.

40:26.843 --> 40:29.971
As the queen and the head of the Society,
I'm the only person who has it.

40:30.638 --> 40:32.474
I'm sharing it because I trust you.

40:33.767 --> 40:35.393
Might wanna hold on to that chair.

40:37.687 --> 40:39.773
[Sam screams]

40:39.856 --> 40:41.691
[exclaiming, panting]

40:50.283 --> 40:51.534
[breathes heavily]

40:57.499 --> 40:58.500
[beeps]

41:00.627 --> 41:02.879
We have a Batcave under our house?

41:03.296 --> 41:04.297
Our headquarters.

41:04.798 --> 41:07.425
No recruit is supposed to see it
until training is complete.

41:07.509 --> 41:09.719
Wow. So you're breaking the rules.

41:09.803 --> 41:11.012
I won't tell if you won't.

41:12.138 --> 41:13.306
What is all this stuff?

41:14.265 --> 41:15.767
Disrupter prototype.

41:15.850 --> 41:18.770
Stolen from a research facility in Kyoto.
Recovered by us.

41:20.313 --> 41:23.733
Ultrasonic elephant whistle
taken from a poaching ring in Chad.

41:24.984 --> 41:28.905
DNA-based nano-device programmed
to target specific genetic sequences.

41:28.988 --> 41:31.908
It can isolate
and contain cellular materials.

41:33.618 --> 41:35.620
Our most decorated operatives.

41:38.540 --> 41:40.542
Lots of people struggle in the beginning.

41:43.003 --> 41:44.254
What's with the empty frame?

41:45.130 --> 41:47.048
A former member who betrayed us.

41:47.966 --> 41:50.468
We keep it empty as a reminder
our powers were given to us

41:50.552 --> 41:52.971
to defend the world, not rule it.

41:54.723 --> 41:56.224
You don't have to worry about that.

41:57.559 --> 42:00.478
I can't even figure out
what some kid wants for Christmas.

42:01.271 --> 42:04.566
The key to mastering your power
is mastering yourself.

42:05.025 --> 42:06.943
[chuckles] It's not helpful.

42:07.610 --> 42:10.947
I know how hard training is,
but this is worth it.

42:11.031 --> 42:13.950
I don't know what this is.

42:14.993 --> 42:18.371
I mean, a couple weeks ago I thought
you were banishing me to summer school,

42:18.455 --> 42:21.041
and then I find out
that you're head of the Avengers.

42:21.124 --> 42:23.835
I have these powers
that I don't know how to use,

42:23.918 --> 42:26.171
and I'm supposed to defend the world?

42:26.254 --> 42:28.214
I went through the same feelings
when I was your age.

42:28.298 --> 42:29.924
I'm a second-born too.

42:30.925 --> 42:32.135
What did you do?

42:32.218 --> 42:34.929
I let go of the pressure
I was putting on myself

42:35.764 --> 42:38.224
and allowed myself
to just be in the moment.

42:38.767 --> 42:40.268
All I hear is noise.

42:40.810 --> 42:41.811
Try this.

42:42.520 --> 42:45.357
You are at one
of those royal events you love,

42:46.107 --> 42:47.984
people, music, chitchat.

42:48.068 --> 42:49.277
What do you do?

42:49.361 --> 42:50.612
I tune them out.

42:51.071 --> 42:52.405
Mm-hmm.

42:52.489 --> 42:55.325
Now, find the sound you want to hear.

42:56.785 --> 42:58.453
You're stronger than you know, Sam.

42:58.536 --> 43:00.246
[Santa] There's many things
that are different than a toy...

43:00.330 --> 43:01.706
[doctor] We have the results.
Are you ready to find out?

43:01.790 --> 43:03.833
-...same answers to the final every year.
-[student] I don't think it's a good idea.

43:03.917 --> 43:05.794
-...Santa could bring you for Christmas.
-[student 2] Fine. Your loss.

43:05.877 --> 43:08.463
[young boy]
I just want my mom to get better.

43:08.546 --> 43:11.132
[static, indistinct voices]

43:11.216 --> 43:12.634
The boy's mom is sick.

43:13.968 --> 43:16.221
He's asking Santa
if she's going to get better.

43:16.721 --> 43:19.140
-Mm-hmm. Keep going.
-[young man] Will you marry me?

43:19.224 --> 43:23.395
A guy is proposing to his girlfriend
in the spot where they first met.

43:24.771 --> 43:25.772
[student 2] It's not a big deal.

43:25.855 --> 43:29.693
A girl has the answers to a bio test,
but her friend doesn't want to cheat.

43:29.776 --> 43:31.695
-[James] Mm-hmm.
-[doctor] It's a boy. And a girl.

43:31.778 --> 43:35.740
A doctor is telling a pregnant woman
that she's having...

43:35.824 --> 43:37.409
[doctor] Congratulations,
you're having twins.

43:37.492 --> 43:38.576
...twins.

43:38.993 --> 43:39.994
[James] Excellent work.

43:42.747 --> 43:46.001
See? Being second-born
doesn't mean you're second-best.

43:47.502 --> 43:49.671
-[Sam] Just one question.
-Mm-hmm?

43:49.754 --> 43:51.548
Does the boy's mom get better?

43:52.424 --> 43:55.427
Yeah, she did.
And yours would be very proud.

43:57.262 --> 43:58.430
Are we gonna go again?

43:59.472 --> 44:01.474
Okay, whatever you say.

44:04.310 --> 44:07.188
Please tell me you can't see anything!

44:07.272 --> 44:09.649
All I see is a princess
who needs to work harder.

44:09.733 --> 44:16.114
James, I want nothing more
than to get off this... stupid thing!

44:16.197 --> 44:18.366
But I just can't do it.

44:18.450 --> 44:19.576
[Roxana screams]

44:19.659 --> 44:20.827
Come on. Lift it.

44:21.578 --> 44:23.872
[insects buzzing]

44:25.957 --> 44:26.791
Yes.

44:31.338 --> 44:33.173
-[beeps]
-How'd I do this time?

44:33.256 --> 44:35.550
You were under for ten minutes.

44:35.633 --> 44:38.178
[Anna] That's the longest
you've held on to my powers yet.

44:38.261 --> 44:39.387
Yes.

44:39.471 --> 44:41.306
Brava. Quite the improvement.

44:41.890 --> 44:43.558
Hey, Charlie!

44:47.145 --> 44:49.147
No class for you today, Prince Tuma.

44:49.230 --> 44:51.316
Really? Sweet.

44:51.399 --> 44:52.776
-Yeah. Charlie's sick.
-Oh.

44:53.234 --> 44:54.861
He ate something
that didn't agree with him.

45:02.035 --> 45:03.036
Hey, buddy.

45:05.288 --> 45:06.289
Charlie.

45:07.749 --> 45:10.001
I didn't know that treat
would make you sick.

45:10.627 --> 45:13.046
I was just trying to be nice.
I didn't know what else to do.

45:14.631 --> 45:16.841
Everyone always just listens
to what I tell them.

45:17.592 --> 45:18.426
[Charlie barks]

45:21.388 --> 45:22.305
Okay.

45:23.306 --> 45:25.350
Look, look, look.

45:25.433 --> 45:26.726
-This is my fault.
-[cries]

45:26.810 --> 45:30.021
Clearly, physical duress
doesn't trigger your powers.

45:30.105 --> 45:32.357
I got something really special
for you, Roxy. Okay?

45:32.440 --> 45:34.067
-Oh, my phone.
-Yeah.

45:34.150 --> 45:34.984
[chuckles]

45:36.277 --> 45:37.195
What are you doing?

45:37.278 --> 45:39.781
I know you missed your followers
over the past few weeks.

45:39.864 --> 45:42.200
I'm sure that they would love
to say hi, right?

45:42.283 --> 45:45.203
You're bluffing.
I mean, you don't even know my password.

45:45.286 --> 45:47.706
With the click of a button,
I can create the most sophisticated

45:47.789 --> 45:50.709
interactive obstacle course in the world.
I think I got this.

45:50.792 --> 45:53.628
No. They can't see me like this.
James, why are you being so mean?

45:53.712 --> 45:57.465
-And we are live in four, three, two, one!
-I mean. I mean, look at me. No. No. No!

45:57.549 --> 45:58.550
No!

45:59.467 --> 46:02.846
-[Roxana breathes heavily]
-Well done. Same time tomorrow.

46:03.930 --> 46:04.973
[Roxana] Can you please log off?

46:06.141 --> 46:09.978
Oh, I was never online.
Reception's terrible down here. [chuckles]

46:23.491 --> 46:24.659
Everything okay?

46:25.160 --> 46:27.120
I turned myself invisible today.

46:27.203 --> 46:28.246
That's great.

46:28.830 --> 46:29.998
But it's not.

46:31.416 --> 46:34.377
I'm able to do all these really cool
things, but no one will see me.

46:34.461 --> 46:35.795
So, what does it matter?

46:35.879 --> 46:39.090
I forgot, livestream or it's not real.

46:39.174 --> 46:40.800
Performance is part of being a royal.

46:40.884 --> 46:42.677
I've lived my whole life online.

46:43.511 --> 46:44.721
[sighs]

46:45.430 --> 46:46.681
It's always been me.

46:47.223 --> 46:50.727
Why can't you be you without all that?

46:51.561 --> 46:53.646
Because I genuinely don't know
where to start.

46:55.565 --> 46:57.275
Well, I can't help you with that.

46:58.318 --> 46:59.361
Thanks a lot. [chuckles]

47:00.070 --> 47:02.572
Only because you have to figure that out
for yourself.

47:04.324 --> 47:06.201
Yeah. [sniffs]

47:06.284 --> 47:07.702
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

47:08.370 --> 47:09.287
How do I look?

47:09.954 --> 47:10.789
Awful.

47:11.664 --> 47:13.041
[both chuckle]

47:24.302 --> 47:25.303
It's a new record.

47:27.555 --> 47:30.308
[indistinct overlapping voices]

47:42.570 --> 47:44.364
-[Matteo] Come on.
-[insects buzzing]

47:45.031 --> 47:46.116
-[Matteo] Yes!
-[Tuma] Awesome!

47:46.199 --> 47:48.118
-Bro!
-[chuckles]

47:48.201 --> 47:49.119
That was awesome.

47:49.202 --> 47:51.121
-Thank you.
-Charlie! You're all better!

47:51.663 --> 47:52.622
[Sam] Aw.

47:53.832 --> 47:57.419
Aw, that's my boy, Charlie. [chuckles]

47:57.502 --> 47:58.962
[chuckling]

48:04.551 --> 48:05.552
[exhales]

48:06.845 --> 48:12.851
Hey, Sam. I'm here. Got the gear.
Super pumped.

48:15.520 --> 48:17.022
[sighs]

48:18.189 --> 48:19.190
Hey, come see our show.

48:23.319 --> 48:24.320
[cell phone vibrates]

48:33.955 --> 48:37.917
[imitates snoring]

48:39.294 --> 48:41.546
[snoring playing through phone]

48:47.052 --> 48:49.971
-[alarm blaring]
-[James on intercom] Attention, trainees.

48:50.055 --> 48:52.140
Suit up and meet
in the loading dock immediately.

48:52.807 --> 48:56.978
Attention, trainees. Suit up and meet
in the loading dock immediately!

48:57.062 --> 48:58.480
[blaring continues]

49:02.108 --> 49:04.194
Let's go! Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in.

49:05.528 --> 49:06.738
Let's go!

49:12.285 --> 49:13.995
There's been a break-in
at the royal treasury.

49:14.079 --> 49:16.915
If the thieves steal the crown jewels,
they could be sold on the black market

49:16.998 --> 49:18.917
for billions to buy
weapons of mass destruction.

49:19.000 --> 49:21.252
-So super low stakes.
-Our first mission.

49:21.336 --> 49:22.420
We got this.

49:26.424 --> 49:29.052
Hey, come to our show.
We're on soon. Thanks.

49:30.136 --> 49:33.014
Come on, Sam. Where are you?

49:35.141 --> 49:36.601
Hey, come to our show. We're on soon.

49:38.186 --> 49:41.022
[James] Your mission is
to protect the jewels at all costs.

49:47.821 --> 49:49.572
[gasps, chuckles]

49:50.240 --> 49:52.033
[Sam] Wow! Look at that!

49:52.617 --> 49:54.744
-Those are some big rocks.
-Yeppers.

49:59.416 --> 50:02.210
[Sam] You guys stay here and guard
the jewels. I saw one of the thieves.

50:02.293 --> 50:03.253
I'm going after him.

50:03.336 --> 50:04.796
She's gonna need backup.

50:04.879 --> 50:06.214
They aren't getting all the glory.

50:09.801 --> 50:11.469
I guess it's just you and me.

50:12.846 --> 50:13.930
Or it's just you.

50:15.765 --> 50:16.683
Hey, guys.

50:19.227 --> 50:20.311
Wait up.

50:20.395 --> 50:22.230
[Sam] I saw him. He was wearing a hood.

50:23.148 --> 50:25.150
[January] He's got to be in there.
Now what?

50:25.775 --> 50:27.736
Maybe we should just wait for James.

50:27.819 --> 50:31.156
No way. If we take this guy down,
James is gonna be super impressed.

50:34.826 --> 50:36.578
[January] It's so dark.
I can't see anything.

50:41.124 --> 50:42.959
[insect buzzing]

50:44.502 --> 50:45.962
-[January] Hey, look.
-[Matteo] Come on.

50:46.046 --> 50:48.631
Come on. Come on.

50:50.467 --> 50:51.593
[Matteo] Watch out!

50:52.344 --> 50:56.097
Oh. I crushed that. [chuckles]

50:56.181 --> 50:57.182
You did it.

50:57.891 --> 50:59.267
Yeah, I did. Thanks.

50:59.351 --> 51:00.935
That was really smart.

51:03.563 --> 51:06.024
Uh, guys. That's my swim coach.

51:06.107 --> 51:08.568
Wait, why would your swim coach
wanna steal the jewels?

51:08.651 --> 51:09.569
The jewels!

51:14.157 --> 51:17.243
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

51:18.286 --> 51:20.372
-This is bad.
-Oh, you think?

51:21.039 --> 51:23.625
In a matter of minutes,
you managed to disobey my orders,

51:23.708 --> 51:25.293
lose a priceless national treasure,

51:25.377 --> 51:28.546
and put yourself in a potentially
deadly situation with no plan.

51:29.631 --> 51:32.258
Your degree of failure is remarkable.

51:33.218 --> 51:34.719
Thank you for your help, Princess Anna.

51:34.803 --> 51:37.555
Of course. Anytime.

51:37.639 --> 51:39.099
Wait, I'm confused. Where are the jewels?

51:39.182 --> 51:41.976
Oh, where they've always been,
in the real treasury.

51:50.568 --> 51:52.821
Congratulations,
you've all failed the test.

51:53.488 --> 51:55.240
I'm canceling tomorrow's training.

51:55.323 --> 51:58.660
Take the day to consider the consequences
had this been real.

52:01.246 --> 52:02.247
Class dismissed.

52:04.249 --> 52:06.876
[cell phone vibrating]

52:06.960 --> 52:07.794
[beeps]

52:07.877 --> 52:09.129
Where were you?

52:09.212 --> 52:12.340
I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.

52:12.424 --> 52:14.009
Yeah, I know. I was there. What happened?

52:14.092 --> 52:15.385
I just couldn't.

52:15.844 --> 52:18.263
-Sam, what's going on? Talk to me.
-I really wanna tell you...

52:18.346 --> 52:19.514
[door opens]

52:19.723 --> 52:21.391
But I can't.

52:21.474 --> 52:22.726
I gotta go.

52:27.188 --> 52:28.189
You okay?

52:30.275 --> 52:31.359
I don't wanna talk about it.

52:34.112 --> 52:35.530
[Tuma] None of us are getting in.

52:35.613 --> 52:39.617
Catherine said, "No matter what obstacles
you face, nothing is impossible."

52:40.493 --> 52:42.787
She also said
not everyone's gonna make the cut.

52:45.040 --> 52:46.124
Definitely one of those people.

52:47.334 --> 52:50.503
Hey, you deserve to be here
as much as anyone else.

52:51.046 --> 52:53.298
I've been going to Strathmore
for three years.

52:53.381 --> 52:55.717
You didn't even know I existed
until this summer.

52:55.800 --> 52:58.845
But that wasn't your fault. That was mine.

53:01.431 --> 53:02.682
And we know you now.

53:03.725 --> 53:05.393
Until we all get our minds wiped.

53:06.811 --> 53:08.438
What if that really happens?

53:09.397 --> 53:11.399
We'll forget we even have powers.

53:12.233 --> 53:13.526
We'll forget the whole summer.

53:15.695 --> 53:16.863
Do we really want that?

53:18.281 --> 53:19.199
No way.

53:19.282 --> 53:22.243
Hanging with you guys has been
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

53:22.327 --> 53:25.038
Well, if they're gonna make us forget,

53:25.121 --> 53:27.499
we can at least
make this a day to remember.

53:29.042 --> 53:31.378
I have an idea. Come on.

54:34.649 --> 54:35.984
Told you I'd bring the party.

54:37.402 --> 54:39.779
Is this one as fun as the one you threw
at your old school?

54:39.863 --> 54:42.782
Well, there are no explosions yet, so...
[chuckles]

54:42.866 --> 54:44.117
How'd that happen anyway?

54:45.285 --> 54:47.245
My friends and I were messing around
in the lab.

54:48.121 --> 54:50.248
Told them to mix a bunch of chemicals,
as a joke.

54:50.915 --> 54:52.500
You know, see if we could start a fire.

54:53.460 --> 54:55.170
Didn't know I was using my power on them.

54:56.504 --> 54:58.381
Can't really use that excuse anymore.

55:00.091 --> 55:03.345
If I told someone to do something and
something bad happened, it was on them.

55:04.679 --> 55:06.264
But now I realize it's on me.

55:07.849 --> 55:11.102
Took you a while, but you got there.

55:11.603 --> 55:12.896
Now I'm starting to grow on you.

55:13.396 --> 55:16.191
Maybe a little. Like a fungus.

55:16.900 --> 55:19.277
[chuckles] Yeah, like a fungus.

55:19.819 --> 55:21.488
[Roxana] We got the Popsicles. [chuckles]

55:21.571 --> 55:22.572
[Sam] Thanks.

55:25.992 --> 55:28.495
I want a pink one. Are they poisoned?

55:28.578 --> 55:31.164
[chuckles] They're all the same.
If you go down, we all do.

55:33.375 --> 55:34.501
We should do this again.

55:35.126 --> 55:36.711
Maybe, like, Saturday?

55:37.379 --> 55:41.508
Can't. Sister's stupid coronation.
You guys have fun.

55:41.591 --> 55:44.010
Yeah, must suck going to the hottest event
of the season.

55:44.094 --> 55:45.804
With the prettiest dresses.

55:45.887 --> 55:48.973
It's definitely not the hottest event
of the season.

55:49.474 --> 55:53.061
Just instead of only Illyria
obsessing over my sister for an hour,

55:53.144 --> 55:54.396
the whole world gets to.

55:55.522 --> 55:56.940
I can always make Sam invite us.

55:59.317 --> 56:01.778
But mind control would be
a messed up thing to do to a friend.

56:03.822 --> 56:06.282
I mean, if you guys really wanna go,
I could use the company.

56:06.366 --> 56:07.450
-Really?
-Yeah.

56:07.534 --> 56:08.910
Oh, my God. [screams]

56:08.993 --> 56:10.161
[chuckles]

56:10.245 --> 56:11.996
Okay. Never do that again.

56:12.080 --> 56:13.331
Oh, my God!

56:19.129 --> 56:21.172
You guys go ahead. We'll catch up.

56:21.840 --> 56:23.091
That was the best day ever.

56:23.466 --> 56:25.927
Totally, so why are you sad?

56:26.594 --> 56:30.348
It just hit me. I'm leaving soon,
which means I'm not going to be here.

56:30.432 --> 56:33.101
After training, it's back to my kingdom
and my stupid brother.

56:33.184 --> 56:34.436
[Sam chuckles]

56:34.519 --> 56:37.105
[January] We never even got a chance
to hang out at your palace.

56:39.274 --> 56:40.275
How about now?

56:42.777 --> 56:43.778
Come on.

56:49.826 --> 56:51.786
Can't believe you talked me
into missing curfew.

56:51.870 --> 56:53.538
We could get into so much trouble.

56:54.080 --> 56:55.081
I like it.

56:55.749 --> 56:57.792
They tightened security
for the upcoming coronation.

56:57.876 --> 57:00.420
We can't go through the front gate
without my mom finding out.

57:00.503 --> 57:01.504
Come on.

57:08.303 --> 57:10.138
Epsilon 97 red Q zero.

57:28.281 --> 57:29.199
[January] Wow!

57:30.158 --> 57:32.577
My dad converted the tower into a studio.

57:33.787 --> 57:36.831
He and my uncle Edmond would come up here
and jam all the time.

57:38.333 --> 57:44.547
He always said, "Snowflake, it's good
to rule, but it's more fun to rock."

57:44.964 --> 57:48.760
[playing Mozart's
"Eine kleine Nachtmusik"]

58:00.605 --> 58:01.898
[January chuckles]

58:01.981 --> 58:03.775
It was either piano or ballet.

58:04.275 --> 58:07.570
Had a lot of free time while everyone
doted on my precious brother.

58:07.862 --> 58:12.701
[playing rock music]

58:30.093 --> 58:32.262
-[January chuckles]
-Sam?

58:36.641 --> 58:37.684
[Sam] Mike, wait!

58:37.767 --> 58:40.895
No. Mike, wait! Wait!

58:41.396 --> 58:42.605
I'm sorry about the gig.

58:42.689 --> 58:44.190
Yeah, and now you're in a band
with somebody else?

58:44.274 --> 58:45.817
No, she's just a girl from school.

58:45.900 --> 58:49.112
-Oh, right. You mean another princess.
-It's not like that. I can explain.

58:49.195 --> 58:50.196
Go ahead.

58:51.406 --> 58:52.323
I--

58:52.657 --> 58:55.493
Yeah, that's what I thought.

58:56.411 --> 58:58.038
Later, Your Highness.

59:05.545 --> 59:06.463
Everything okay?

59:08.256 --> 59:09.257
We should get back.

59:21.144 --> 59:23.271
My mom really wanted me
to do the whole ballet thing,

59:23.355 --> 59:24.522
but I'm happy I picked piano.

59:24.606 --> 59:28.777
It's so much fun to just jam,
and, anyway, tulle makes me itch.

59:28.860 --> 59:29.944
[Sam] Mm-hmm.

59:31.196 --> 59:32.655
-[Inmate 34 grunts]
-[grunts]

59:33.073 --> 59:34.574
[gasping]

59:35.533 --> 59:37.786
Really, James? Kidnapping after curfew?

59:37.869 --> 59:40.538
I mean, I get it.
Lesson three, everything's a test.

59:42.290 --> 59:44.417
-[Inmate 34 groans]
-[Sam] It's not a simulation!

59:44.501 --> 59:45.752
[Inmate 34 grunts]

59:48.129 --> 59:49.047
-Freeze!
-[grunts]

59:49.130 --> 59:50.715
[grunts, groans]

59:51.466 --> 59:53.009
[insects buzzing]

59:53.093 --> 59:54.094
[Inmate 34 groans]

59:58.765 --> 59:59.724
[James] Sam?

59:59.808 --> 1:00:00.809
Another time...

1:00:01.643 --> 1:00:02.644
Snowflake.

1:00:05.188 --> 1:00:06.189
[James] What happened?

1:00:06.272 --> 1:00:08.441
There was this really scary guy,
and he had powers too,

1:00:08.525 --> 1:00:10.735
and he threw January and Sam
without even touching them.

1:00:10.819 --> 1:00:12.570
Go to your rooms.
Lock the doors right now.

1:00:12.654 --> 1:00:14.989
-Who was he?
-He's a very dangerous telekinetic.

1:00:15.073 --> 1:00:16.991
-Yeah, no kidding.
-We have to go after him.

1:00:17.075 --> 1:00:18.159
That's out of the question.

1:00:18.827 --> 1:00:21.913
He called me "Snowflake."
Only my father did that.

1:00:21.996 --> 1:00:23.832
-Stand down, Sam.
-How did he know?

1:00:23.915 --> 1:00:24.916
That's an order.

1:00:27.168 --> 1:00:29.170
Okay. Go to your rooms and stay there.

1:00:41.224 --> 1:00:43.476
[echoing] Sam! Hey! Wait!

1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:46.062
[Sam breathing heavily]

1:01:11.129 --> 1:01:13.423
[breathing heavily]

1:01:19.971 --> 1:01:23.266
[heart beating]

1:01:26.811 --> 1:01:27.812
[gasps]

1:01:28.980 --> 1:01:30.190
Who are you?

1:01:34.611 --> 1:01:35.612
[grunts]

1:01:36.529 --> 1:01:38.656
[gasping]

1:01:38.740 --> 1:01:39.824
[James] Stop!

1:01:42.327 --> 1:01:44.788
-Hello, James.
-Surrender.

1:01:44.871 --> 1:01:46.206
You know I won't.

1:01:46.998 --> 1:01:48.208
[Sam grunting]

1:01:50.251 --> 1:01:51.461
[grunting]

1:01:54.130 --> 1:01:57.133
[grunting, groaning]

1:02:01.179 --> 1:02:04.432
[grunting]

1:02:05.392 --> 1:02:06.893
[groans]

1:02:06.976 --> 1:02:09.729
[grunting]

1:02:12.982 --> 1:02:15.276
You can't win. There's too many of us.

1:02:15.360 --> 1:02:17.028
All I need is one.

1:02:17.529 --> 1:02:18.863
[grunts]

1:02:20.782 --> 1:02:21.866
-[grunts]
-[groans]

1:02:25.578 --> 1:02:27.455
[groans]

1:02:27.539 --> 1:02:28.832
-[January] James!
-[Tuma] January!

1:02:28.915 --> 1:02:29.916
[Matteo] Sam!

1:02:31.334 --> 1:02:32.335
[Roxana] Sam!

1:02:32.877 --> 1:02:33.920
Sam!

1:02:34.004 --> 1:02:34.963
[breathing heavily]

1:02:35.046 --> 1:02:36.172
You knock out the original,

1:02:36.256 --> 1:02:37.632
-you knock out the power.
-[Tuma] James!

1:02:37.716 --> 1:02:38.967
Tell me who you are.

1:02:42.971 --> 1:02:46.224
For the last ten years,
it has been "Inmate 34."

1:02:46.599 --> 1:02:48.351
-[Matteo] January!
-[January] Sam!

1:02:48.435 --> 1:02:51.479
But before your mother
took my name away from me...

1:02:51.563 --> 1:02:52.856
[Tuma] James!

1:02:52.939 --> 1:02:54.315
...I was your favorite uncle.

1:02:56.443 --> 1:02:57.444
[Tuma] January!

1:03:08.997 --> 1:03:10.248
My turn.

1:03:10.331 --> 1:03:11.708
[groans]

1:03:17.172 --> 1:03:18.173
Hey.

1:03:19.466 --> 1:03:21.843
I've got your back, always.

1:03:25.722 --> 1:03:27.140
Let's go find the others.

1:03:29.768 --> 1:03:31.603
[female paramedic] All right. Here we go.

1:03:31.686 --> 1:03:33.438
Two bumps, and up.

1:03:36.191 --> 1:03:38.360
Radio the university
and let them know we're ten out.

1:03:38.443 --> 1:03:41.363
[male paramedic] Will do.
All right, just hooking him up here.

1:03:42.739 --> 1:03:45.241
[female paramedic] Vitals are stable.
We'll start O2 if we need to.

1:03:45.325 --> 1:03:46.951
[male paramedic]
Gotcha. I'm right behind you.

1:03:54.042 --> 1:03:55.585
Let 'em know we're on our way.

1:03:59.673 --> 1:04:00.674
This is all my fault.

1:04:01.174 --> 1:04:02.300
Hey, no.

1:04:02.384 --> 1:04:04.094
You did what you could to stop him.

1:04:14.396 --> 1:04:17.399
[sirens wailing]

1:04:36.209 --> 1:04:38.044
[Catherine] James is in intensive care.

1:04:38.128 --> 1:04:41.131
You put his life and yours in danger
because you disobeyed an order.

1:04:41.214 --> 1:04:42.590
Is he really my uncle?

1:04:43.466 --> 1:04:44.467
[sighs]

1:04:48.513 --> 1:04:50.515
-Sam, it's complicated.
-I'll make it simple.

1:04:51.558 --> 1:04:53.309
There was no plane crash.

1:04:53.393 --> 1:04:58.273
The empty frame on the wall, the man
who betrayed the Society, that was Edmond.

1:04:59.107 --> 1:05:00.859
Is my father still alive too?

1:05:02.777 --> 1:05:03.778
No, darling.

1:05:04.446 --> 1:05:05.530
He's not.

1:05:06.865 --> 1:05:10.285
Edmond wanted to be king,
so he murdered your father.

1:05:10.368 --> 1:05:12.579
I uncovered the truth
before he claimed the throne,

1:05:12.662 --> 1:05:13.955
but nobody could know.

1:05:14.706 --> 1:05:16.791
Trust in the royal family
would've been shattered.

1:05:16.875 --> 1:05:18.043
So you lied.

1:05:18.668 --> 1:05:20.295
I did the only thing I could.

1:05:20.378 --> 1:05:22.047
He killed my dad.

1:05:22.130 --> 1:05:24.090
And my husband.

1:05:24.174 --> 1:05:28.219
I stripped Edmond of his identity.
I locked him up in our most secure prison.

1:05:28.303 --> 1:05:31.473
It's no coincidence
he escaped so close to the coronation.

1:05:32.766 --> 1:05:36.102
He wants the throne, and he wants revenge.

1:05:36.186 --> 1:05:37.520
I wanna see him.

1:05:38.813 --> 1:05:39.939
Mom, please.

1:05:53.119 --> 1:05:54.120
[beeps]

1:06:01.503 --> 1:06:03.588
-[Edmond] Hey.
-Snowflake.

1:06:03.672 --> 1:06:05.131
You wanna learn how to play?

1:06:05.215 --> 1:06:06.591
Come on over here.

1:06:07.467 --> 1:06:11.179
So all you have to do is you just
strum the guitar like that. Can you do it?

1:06:14.015 --> 1:06:15.767
You're officially a rock star, yeah.

1:06:21.940 --> 1:06:22.982
[Edmond] Catherine?

1:06:23.942 --> 1:06:25.443
Have you come to gloat?

1:06:25.527 --> 1:06:26.528
Make it quick.

1:06:31.616 --> 1:06:32.617
Hello, Sam.

1:06:34.619 --> 1:06:35.620
Uncle Edmond.

1:06:38.915 --> 1:06:40.834
It's been a long time
since I've heard my name.

1:06:42.043 --> 1:06:43.795
How could you kill your brother?

1:06:56.891 --> 1:06:58.309
It's an electric cage.

1:06:59.144 --> 1:07:01.980
And this collar projects a field
that nullifies my power.

1:07:03.314 --> 1:07:04.315
Come closer.

1:07:08.862 --> 1:07:10.280
I loved my brother, you know?

1:07:11.489 --> 1:07:14.159
But great causes demand great sacrifices.

1:07:15.660 --> 1:07:16.911
You wanted power?

1:07:17.662 --> 1:07:19.372
I wanted to tear down the monarchy

1:07:19.456 --> 1:07:22.792
so that the people could live as citizens,
not subjects.

1:07:24.753 --> 1:07:26.254
But your father wanted to wait.

1:07:28.715 --> 1:07:31.676
He said that change takes time.

1:07:32.510 --> 1:07:34.179
But that way nothing gets done.

1:07:34.763 --> 1:07:36.097
So you murdered him.

1:07:38.433 --> 1:07:41.311
You will never forgive me
for what I've done, Snowflake.

1:07:43.188 --> 1:07:45.106
At least now you understand why.

1:08:11.132 --> 1:08:12.133
[Sam] El?

1:08:12.884 --> 1:08:13.885
[Eleanor] Sam.

1:08:15.845 --> 1:08:17.055
Didn't realize you were back.

1:08:18.390 --> 1:08:20.016
Summer school was a bust.

1:08:20.600 --> 1:08:23.353
Hey, at least now you can help me
prepare for the coronation.

1:08:23.436 --> 1:08:25.897
Just please don't be late for once.

1:08:26.856 --> 1:08:28.900
You have no idea what I'm dealing with.

1:08:28.983 --> 1:08:30.568
Do you think you have it tough?

1:08:30.652 --> 1:08:33.279
You get to do whatever you like,

1:08:33.363 --> 1:08:37.534
and I have to live up to everybody's
expectations because you never do.

1:08:37.617 --> 1:08:39.786
I never asked you to do that for me.

1:08:39.869 --> 1:08:41.079
You didn't have to.

1:08:41.162 --> 1:08:42.539
What is that supposed to mean?

1:08:45.792 --> 1:08:47.919
You were so young when dad died,

1:08:48.461 --> 1:08:50.255
and you took it so hard.

1:08:51.881 --> 1:08:56.594
I chose to be the perfect princess,
so you could just be free to be a kid.

1:08:56.678 --> 1:09:01.099
And sure, there are some parts
of the kingdom that feel old-fashioned,

1:09:01.808 --> 1:09:04.894
but I'm about to be
in a position to enact real change.

1:09:05.437 --> 1:09:06.730
That means something to me,

1:09:06.813 --> 1:09:09.774
and every time that you yell,
"Down with the monarchy,"

1:09:09.858 --> 1:09:13.361
you are rebelling
against everything that I stand for!

1:09:15.447 --> 1:09:16.448
[scoffs]

1:09:23.496 --> 1:09:26.166
[Roxana] I didn't realize
it was going to get this real, this fast.

1:09:26.708 --> 1:09:28.585
Do you think Sam's coming back?

1:09:28.668 --> 1:09:31.296
Maybe, or maybe not.
I mean, she almost got herself killed.

1:09:31.379 --> 1:09:32.714
She almost got James killed.

1:09:32.797 --> 1:09:34.424
Who even was that crazy guy?

1:09:34.507 --> 1:09:37.302
I have a bad feeling we're gonna find out
sooner rather than later.

1:09:38.386 --> 1:09:39.804
Well, what are we meant to do now?

1:09:40.930 --> 1:09:42.015
Keep practicing.

1:09:42.098 --> 1:09:43.308
[Roxana] They'll give us a new teacher.

1:09:44.017 --> 1:09:46.853
-And what about the coronation?
-Sam said she'd get us in.

1:09:46.936 --> 1:09:49.522
We should be there for her. Right?

1:09:51.524 --> 1:09:54.944
[somber guitar music playing]

1:10:20.345 --> 1:10:21.346
You awake?

1:10:22.514 --> 1:10:23.723
Yeah. I can't sleep either.

1:10:24.224 --> 1:10:25.350
Yeah, I know why.

1:10:25.433 --> 1:10:28.019
You're too excited to hang out
with Roxana at the coronation.

1:10:28.103 --> 1:10:29.771
[chuckles] Be quiet.

1:10:30.105 --> 1:10:32.565
What I'm actually thinking about
is what's gonna happen after that.

1:10:33.149 --> 1:10:34.150
If we're gonna get in.

1:10:34.901 --> 1:10:35.985
Into the Society?

1:10:36.069 --> 1:10:37.112
Yeah.

1:10:37.779 --> 1:10:39.030
For the first time in my life,

1:10:39.114 --> 1:10:41.199
I feel I could do something
that actually matters.

1:10:41.282 --> 1:10:42.283
And let's be honest,

1:10:42.784 --> 1:10:46.705
royalty by day, superhero by night
sounds pretty dope.

1:10:48.039 --> 1:10:51.251
No matter what happens,
I'm glad I got to meet you.

1:10:52.043 --> 1:10:53.837
Hey, don't laugh.

1:10:53.920 --> 1:10:54.921
I'm not.

1:10:55.547 --> 1:10:56.548
I feel the same way.

1:10:58.883 --> 1:11:00.885
[sighs] This has been one crazy summer.

1:11:16.651 --> 1:11:17.652
[knocks]

1:11:27.454 --> 1:11:28.621
[Sam] Hey.

1:11:30.582 --> 1:11:31.666
How are you feeling?

1:11:32.667 --> 1:11:35.170
I'm a little sore still, but I'll be okay.

1:11:36.338 --> 1:11:37.839
I brought you a snack.

1:11:37.922 --> 1:11:40.342
Figured you could use a break
from hospital food.

1:11:41.384 --> 1:11:44.262
Is this a bagel?
You really are trying to kill me.

1:11:44.346 --> 1:11:46.473
Oh, don't worry. It's gluten-free.

1:11:47.349 --> 1:11:50.518
-You remembered my allergy. Put it there.
-[Sam] Mm-hmm.

1:11:52.604 --> 1:11:54.606
[sighs]

1:11:54.689 --> 1:11:58.902
I feel terrible about what happened.

1:12:00.653 --> 1:12:05.283
You told me not to go after Edmond,
and I should've listened.

1:12:07.660 --> 1:12:11.956
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't even be in here.

1:12:12.999 --> 1:12:16.211
Well, I am always right,

1:12:16.878 --> 1:12:18.171
but I forgive you.

1:12:21.049 --> 1:12:23.677
And I'm not entirely convinced
that Edmond was working alone.

1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:25.679
We may not have seen the end of this.

1:12:30.600 --> 1:12:33.520
I was just starting to find my place...

1:12:34.896 --> 1:12:35.897
you know?

1:12:37.315 --> 1:12:40.568
I finally meet royals
I actually get along with,

1:12:41.736 --> 1:12:43.738
and I was figuring out my powers.

1:12:46.616 --> 1:12:48.618
And then it all falls apart.

1:12:50.453 --> 1:12:51.496
Sam...

1:12:52.914 --> 1:12:55.333
I'm a second-born too, remember?

1:12:56.042 --> 1:12:57.585
I know what it's like to feel alone.

1:12:59.254 --> 1:13:02.215
And, thankfully, there's, like, 20 of me
to keep me company, but...

1:13:02.298 --> 1:13:03.842
[chuckles]

1:13:04.884 --> 1:13:06.302
You're meant for great things.

1:13:08.388 --> 1:13:09.764
I really wanna believe that.

1:13:11.725 --> 1:13:13.560
Well, I do, and you should.

1:13:16.062 --> 1:13:19.149
And when the moment comes,
you'll be ready.

1:13:22.318 --> 1:13:23.445
Enough of this mushy stuff.

1:13:23.528 --> 1:13:25.280
Give me my bagel
and get out of here, okay?

1:13:25.780 --> 1:13:26.781
Yeah.

1:14:51.032 --> 1:14:52.033
[sighs]

1:14:53.118 --> 1:14:54.953
[Catherine] Happy birthday, darling.

1:14:59.833 --> 1:15:01.042
You look like a queen.

1:15:06.464 --> 1:15:07.716
What if I'm not ready?

1:15:13.013 --> 1:15:14.180
Can I tell you a secret?

1:15:17.600 --> 1:15:19.436
I wasn't ready either.

1:15:21.021 --> 1:15:23.064
Act like the leader
they believe you to be.

1:15:25.650 --> 1:15:27.027
That's how you become one.

1:15:40.415 --> 1:15:43.960
[cheering]

1:15:56.348 --> 1:15:59.768
-Your Lordship, please. Thank you.
-[shutter clicking]

1:16:14.574 --> 1:16:16.659
[Matteo] Props to Sam for coming through.

1:16:16.743 --> 1:16:19.746
[Tuma] It's hard to impress me,
and even I'm impressed.

1:16:20.246 --> 1:16:22.874
[Roxana] Every single important royal
in the world is here.

1:16:23.667 --> 1:16:26.461
[sighs] Is this not the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen?

1:16:27.379 --> 1:16:28.546
It is.

1:16:28.630 --> 1:16:29.839
Too bad James can't be here.

1:16:31.883 --> 1:16:33.218
Hey, where's Sam anyway?

1:16:33.301 --> 1:16:34.594
Probably helping Eleanor get ready.

1:16:35.679 --> 1:16:38.223
Hey, excuse me, ma'am?
I'd love one of those mints.

1:16:38.306 --> 1:16:39.641
It's my last one.

1:16:40.642 --> 1:16:41.643
Please.

1:16:45.647 --> 1:16:48.024
[whispering] That's weird.
My powers aren't working.

1:16:49.401 --> 1:16:50.402
Where's January?

1:16:55.740 --> 1:16:56.991
This is a restricted area.

1:16:57.075 --> 1:16:58.076
Oh, hi.

1:16:58.159 --> 1:16:59.994
The queen sent me
to check on the prisoner.

1:17:00.078 --> 1:17:01.705
We're gonna need confirmation.

1:17:02.706 --> 1:17:04.541
Open the door, now.

1:17:06.292 --> 1:17:08.044
[beeping]

1:17:12.841 --> 1:17:16.219
The plan is working.
The apples were a brilliant idea.

1:17:16.511 --> 1:17:19.472
Sorry, I'm late.
I had to steal Tuma's power.

1:17:19.556 --> 1:17:20.640
Nicely done.

1:17:22.225 --> 1:17:24.936
Epsilon 97 red Q zero.

1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:26.521
[cell powers down]

1:17:27.647 --> 1:17:30.567
None of them have any idea
that we're working together.

1:17:30.650 --> 1:17:32.402
They truly suspect nothing.

1:17:34.988 --> 1:17:35.989
Phase two.

1:17:40.201 --> 1:17:42.203
Hey, there you are. Did you take my power?

1:17:42.287 --> 1:17:44.122
Come with me. All of you.

1:17:44.539 --> 1:17:46.374
Where? I don't wanna miss the coronation.

1:17:46.458 --> 1:17:48.126
Yeah, you do. Where's Sam?

1:17:48.209 --> 1:17:50.462
-How should I know? Give me back my p--
-Don't speak.

1:17:50.545 --> 1:17:51.671
The rest of you too.

1:17:54.591 --> 1:17:56.009
[insect buzzing]

1:18:01.181 --> 1:18:02.932
[computer beeping]

1:18:03.600 --> 1:18:05.435
[female electronic voice]
Scanning all systems.

1:18:07.854 --> 1:18:10.523
Emergency alert systems deactivated.

1:18:11.858 --> 1:18:13.860
Communications deactivated.

1:18:15.487 --> 1:18:16.613
Stop.

1:18:16.696 --> 1:18:19.449
The alarms and external communication's
been disconnected.

1:18:20.617 --> 1:18:21.868
I disabled the master code.

1:18:21.951 --> 1:18:23.286
[January] Smart.

1:18:23.370 --> 1:18:26.998
Even if Catherine figures out what's
going on, she won't be able to stop us.

1:18:27.082 --> 1:18:29.334
We can still move in and out of here
using this pin.

1:18:30.794 --> 1:18:31.878
Come with me.

1:18:46.935 --> 1:18:48.978
Get in the cell. All of you.

1:18:52.315 --> 1:18:53.817
[beeps]

1:18:53.900 --> 1:18:55.985
[cell locks]

1:18:56.069 --> 1:18:57.362
You'll thank me later.

1:19:00.699 --> 1:19:02.409
[door closes]

1:19:05.328 --> 1:19:07.330
[insect buzzing]

1:19:13.503 --> 1:19:14.587
Matteo?

1:19:28.435 --> 1:19:29.811
January, report.

1:19:34.774 --> 1:19:36.651
I put the second-borns in your cell.

1:19:36.735 --> 1:19:38.445
You're clear all the way to the target.

1:19:38.528 --> 1:19:40.989
Excellent.
Everything is going according to plan.

1:19:41.072 --> 1:19:42.907
Proceed to phase three.

1:19:42.991 --> 1:19:45.493
[chattering]

1:20:24.324 --> 1:20:25.450
We have a straggler.

1:20:27.410 --> 1:20:29.245
Epsilon 97 red Q zero!

1:20:29.329 --> 1:20:30.789
Sam knows something's up.

1:20:32.248 --> 1:20:34.250
Catch her before she becomes a problem.

1:20:39.464 --> 1:20:41.466
[female electronic voice]
Security system linked.

1:21:22.132 --> 1:21:25.468
-[clicks, beeps]
-[female voice] Nano-device activated.

1:21:26.052 --> 1:21:28.596
Calibrating DNA target parameters.

1:21:37.814 --> 1:21:44.487
There are moments in the life of every
leader and every parent that stand apart.

1:21:44.904 --> 1:21:46.072
This is one of them.

1:21:48.074 --> 1:21:50.869
I could not hope
for a more deserving successor...

1:21:52.579 --> 1:21:54.080
and a more perfect daughter.

1:21:58.626 --> 1:22:00.378
[security system beeping]

1:22:11.639 --> 1:22:12.724
Hard way it is.

1:22:19.189 --> 1:22:21.399
Mike! Mike, I know you're in there!

1:22:21.483 --> 1:22:22.359
[knocking]

1:22:22.442 --> 1:22:24.277
-Mike!
-Shouldn't you be at the coronation?

1:22:24.361 --> 1:22:25.737
I need your help. It's important.

1:22:25.820 --> 1:22:27.238
What? More important than our gig?

1:22:27.322 --> 1:22:30.825
-Go ask your new best friend.
-Mike, I'm serious. People are in danger.

1:22:30.909 --> 1:22:32.535
It's an emergency.

1:22:32.619 --> 1:22:33.620
What kind of emergency?

1:22:33.703 --> 1:22:34.871
I can't tell you.

1:22:34.954 --> 1:22:36.331
Sounds familiar. Bye.

1:22:36.414 --> 1:22:38.208
Wait. No, okay. I--

1:22:38.291 --> 1:22:40.710
Remember how I could read the numbers
from really far away

1:22:40.794 --> 1:22:42.212
and smell what you had for lunch?

1:22:43.588 --> 1:22:44.714
Yeah, so?

1:22:44.798 --> 1:22:48.301
Well, it turns out I have powers,
and summer school was a training program

1:22:48.385 --> 1:22:51.346
for a secret society of royal superhumans
run by my mom.

1:22:51.429 --> 1:22:53.181
My uncle killed my dad. He escaped jail.

1:22:53.264 --> 1:22:55.892
My new best friend is his spy,
and she can mind control people.

1:22:55.975 --> 1:22:57.227
And the palace is on lockdown,

1:22:57.310 --> 1:23:00.605
and they're about to do something really
horrible to everyone at the coronation.

1:23:00.855 --> 1:23:02.691
[breathes heavily]

1:23:15.954 --> 1:23:17.288
That was the worst story ever.

1:23:18.289 --> 1:23:20.083
[Eleanor] Thank you all for being here.

1:23:21.126 --> 1:23:24.504
I've been preparing for this day
my entire life.

1:23:25.797 --> 1:23:29.926
Queen of Illyria
is a great responsibility.

1:23:49.154 --> 1:23:50.155
Stop.

1:23:50.238 --> 1:23:51.781
I love this power.

1:23:52.657 --> 1:23:53.658
Drop it.

1:23:56.119 --> 1:23:57.328
Don't worry.

1:23:58.038 --> 1:24:02.125
I'm not going to hurt you,
but I can't let you ruin things either.

1:24:02.792 --> 1:24:04.294
You pretended to be my friend

1:24:04.377 --> 1:24:06.588
so that I would show you
how to sneak into the palace.

1:24:06.671 --> 1:24:09.799
Sorry, Sam. I made a deal with Edmond.

1:24:10.425 --> 1:24:13.219
I help him, he gets rid of my brother.

1:24:13.720 --> 1:24:15.472
We've been working together all along.

1:24:15.972 --> 1:24:17.265
I deserve to rule.

1:24:17.349 --> 1:24:19.601
And I can't kill my brother myself.

1:24:19.684 --> 1:24:21.561
That would make me an awful person.

1:24:23.188 --> 1:24:25.231
I'm just looking out for my kingdom.

1:24:25.315 --> 1:24:27.275
Why did Edmond wanna get caught?

1:24:27.359 --> 1:24:28.651
Aren't we nosy?

1:24:30.070 --> 1:24:34.157
Let's just say, everyone of royal birth
at your sister's coronation

1:24:34.240 --> 1:24:36.576
is about to have a really bad day.

1:24:36.659 --> 1:24:40.038
I don't think I properly introduced you
to my best friend, Mike.

1:24:40.121 --> 1:24:41.623
Who? [grunts]

1:24:42.582 --> 1:24:43.583
Bull's-eye.

1:24:45.126 --> 1:24:46.211
I'm glad I believed you.

1:24:46.294 --> 1:24:48.380
-Mike, I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

1:24:48.463 --> 1:24:49.464
All right. What now?

1:24:50.090 --> 1:24:51.341
I have to save my family.

1:24:52.175 --> 1:24:54.761
Wrong. We have to save your family.

1:24:54.844 --> 1:24:57.013
Look, I know it's dangerous,
and I don't have powers,

1:24:57.097 --> 1:24:59.099
but friends don't let friends
save the world by themselves.

1:25:00.058 --> 1:25:01.142
Okay.

1:25:08.191 --> 1:25:12.487
[device beeping]

1:25:14.406 --> 1:25:16.282
[whispering]

1:25:26.876 --> 1:25:29.129
-You have a Batcave under your house?
-That's what I said.

1:25:29.212 --> 1:25:30.213
Come on.

1:25:33.883 --> 1:25:34.884
[Tuma] Sam!

1:25:34.968 --> 1:25:36.302
[controls beep]

1:25:37.178 --> 1:25:38.847
The scary guy's on the loose.
And January--

1:25:38.930 --> 1:25:40.682
I know. We have to go after Edmond.

1:25:40.765 --> 1:25:43.518
-He's been working with January all along.
-Wait, who's Edmond?

1:25:43.601 --> 1:25:46.730
-The scary guy. Also, her not-dead uncle.
-I knew that guy would come back.

1:25:46.813 --> 1:25:48.898
-And who are you?
-Mike Kleinberg.

1:25:48.982 --> 1:25:50.150
So...

1:25:50.233 --> 1:25:51.443
He's my best friend.

1:25:52.861 --> 1:25:54.279
Edmond wanted to get caught.

1:25:54.362 --> 1:25:56.197
Coming after me at school was a ruse.

1:25:56.281 --> 1:25:59.367
He needed something from this place.
Something only the Society--

1:26:05.623 --> 1:26:09.169
DNA-based nano-device,
programmed to target specific genes.

1:26:09.669 --> 1:26:12.047
-It's gone.
-One more time using small words.

1:26:12.130 --> 1:26:14.424
Think of a device
that only works on certain people

1:26:14.507 --> 1:26:17.802
who share specific genetic traits.
Like hazel eyes or freckles.

1:26:17.886 --> 1:26:20.513
January said that everyone of royal birth
is about to have a bad day.

1:26:20.597 --> 1:26:23.683
Edmond is going to unleash the device
at the coronation.

1:26:23.767 --> 1:26:26.895
It'll wipe out everyone with a royal
bloodline, including my family.

1:26:26.978 --> 1:26:29.189
-Well, we have to call for help.
-[Sam] There's no one left to call.

1:26:29.272 --> 1:26:30.440
James is in the hospital.

1:26:30.523 --> 1:26:32.275
My mom is leading the coronation.

1:26:33.360 --> 1:26:34.444
This one's on us.

1:26:34.527 --> 1:26:36.363
There's a way
we can use the device to stop him.

1:26:36.863 --> 1:26:38.531
You want us to go up against him?

1:26:38.907 --> 1:26:40.408
We have something he doesn't.

1:26:41.326 --> 1:26:43.078
He's alone. We are a team.

1:26:43.161 --> 1:26:47.540
He's more powerful than any of us,
but he's not more powerful than all of us.

1:26:48.416 --> 1:26:50.126
-Who's with me?
-[Tuma] Let's do this.

1:26:50.210 --> 1:26:51.378
Obviously, I'm in.

1:26:51.461 --> 1:26:52.629
I can't sit this one out.

1:26:52.712 --> 1:26:54.381
[Sam] Edmond wore a collar in custody.

1:26:54.464 --> 1:26:56.466
It radiates a field that cancels powers.

1:26:56.549 --> 1:26:58.259
So, we just have to
put it around his neck?

1:26:59.135 --> 1:27:00.595
Without him killing us with his pinkie.

1:27:00.679 --> 1:27:04.015
Or we get the other collars from his cell,
and we build a trap.

1:27:04.099 --> 1:27:04.974
Here's the plan.

1:27:06.101 --> 1:27:07.185
We split up.

1:27:07.268 --> 1:27:09.270
That way he won't see us coming.

1:27:09.354 --> 1:27:10.939
Tuma, you climb up the elevator cable.

1:27:12.565 --> 1:27:13.441
Why can't I ride it?

1:27:14.150 --> 1:27:16.486
He'll hear it coming
and send it crashing to the ground.

1:27:16.569 --> 1:27:18.613
-Oh.
-I'll take the north air duct.

1:27:22.909 --> 1:27:24.619
Sweet.
I'll free-climb the side of the palace.

1:27:24.703 --> 1:27:25.995
Sounds dangerous.

1:27:26.705 --> 1:27:28.248
[Roxana] Relax. I'm invisible.

1:27:29.290 --> 1:27:30.583
I'm just gonna take the stairs.

1:27:32.043 --> 1:27:33.336
All right. Well, what about me?

1:27:33.420 --> 1:27:36.756
You and Matteo
are the most crucial part of the plan.

1:27:39.217 --> 1:27:41.469
[device beeping]

1:27:41.553 --> 1:27:43.388
[female electronic voice]
Ready for deployment.

1:27:48.643 --> 1:27:50.061
[clicks, beeps]

1:28:02.699 --> 1:28:03.700
[Sam] Don't do it.

1:28:06.286 --> 1:28:08.455
Eleanor hasn't done anything to you.

1:28:09.122 --> 1:28:12.000
And neither have
any of the people in there.

1:28:12.083 --> 1:28:14.252
This is the new beginning.

1:28:15.045 --> 1:28:19.049
Freedom. And not only for Illyria,
but for the other kingdoms as well.

1:28:19.132 --> 1:28:21.134
It's a world without royals.

1:28:22.052 --> 1:28:23.094
Isn't that what you want?

1:28:24.054 --> 1:28:25.055
Not like this.

1:28:27.515 --> 1:28:29.100
This isn't freedom.

1:28:29.726 --> 1:28:30.727
It's murder.

1:28:32.812 --> 1:28:34.773
Time is running out, Snowflake.

1:28:35.982 --> 1:28:37.942
And you cannot defeat me.

1:28:39.110 --> 1:28:40.111
Not by myself.

1:28:41.988 --> 1:28:44.282
Disarm the device. Surrender now.

1:28:44.366 --> 1:28:46.284
You're not powerful enough to control me.

1:28:46.368 --> 1:28:47.994
I know, dude, but I made you look.

1:28:48.078 --> 1:28:50.080
[grunting]

1:28:50.622 --> 1:28:51.998
[Tuma] Give it. Give it. I'm right here!

1:28:52.082 --> 1:28:52.957
-Tuma!
-Roxana!

1:28:56.378 --> 1:28:57.212

1:29:12.811 --> 1:29:13.853
Come on!

1:29:19.776 --> 1:29:20.735
Yes!

1:29:20.819 --> 1:29:23.655
[grunts, pants]

1:29:43.633 --> 1:29:45.468
[panting]

1:30:08.033 --> 1:30:10.660
Do you swear
to uphold the laws of Illyria?

1:30:11.119 --> 1:30:12.120
I do.

1:30:18.668 --> 1:30:20.837
[panting]

1:30:42.484 --> 1:30:43.485
[Mike] Hi.

1:30:44.611 --> 1:30:46.404
-[grunts]
-Not gonna happen.

1:30:47.155 --> 1:30:50.325
We brought the collars from your cell.
Your powers aren't gonna work in here.

1:30:50.950 --> 1:30:53.953
And without your powers, it's game over.

1:30:55.830 --> 1:30:57.165
Give me that or we're both gonna die.

1:30:57.248 --> 1:30:59.167
You programmed this thing
to target royals.

1:30:59.250 --> 1:31:01.628
But we reprogrammed it to trap you.

1:31:05.757 --> 1:31:06.758

1:31:47.966 --> 1:31:50.468
[Mike] Sam! It's over.

1:31:51.052 --> 1:31:52.470
Your plan worked. We got him.

1:31:53.722 --> 1:31:55.223
Rise a queen.

1:32:34.596 --> 1:32:35.764
Congratulations.

1:32:35.847 --> 1:32:38.600
Nothing is impossible
if you work together.

1:32:38.683 --> 1:32:40.310
[James] Welcome to The Secret Society.

1:32:40.393 --> 1:32:42.479
I had faith in you guys
from the beginning.

1:32:42.979 --> 1:32:46.107
[Catherine] Go ahead, take your pins.
You've earned them.

1:32:47.442 --> 1:32:50.904
Hey, Charlie. Give me a kiss,
give me a kiss, give me a kiss.

1:32:51.738 --> 1:32:55.241
I've gotta say, James, dope idea
having me practice on Charlie.

1:32:56.117 --> 1:32:57.494
I have a confession to make.

1:32:57.577 --> 1:33:00.997
Your power only works on humans, not dogs.

1:33:01.081 --> 1:33:03.875
Charlie obeys your commands
because he likes you.

1:33:04.542 --> 1:33:05.877
So what was the point?

1:33:05.960 --> 1:33:08.505
To make you care about something
other than yourself.

1:33:08.588 --> 1:33:09.798
[chuckles]

1:33:14.344 --> 1:33:15.261
[Sam] El.

1:33:15.345 --> 1:33:18.264
I just wanna tell you how grateful
I am for what you and your friends did.

1:33:18.765 --> 1:33:19.933
Mom told me everything.

1:33:20.684 --> 1:33:22.936
She doesn't want
any more secrets in our family.

1:33:24.354 --> 1:33:27.065
Well, it was my turn to protect you.

1:33:29.234 --> 1:33:31.277
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

1:33:31.361 --> 1:33:33.697
You're not wrong
that some things do need to change.

1:33:34.698 --> 1:33:36.491
For my first order as queen,

1:33:36.574 --> 1:33:38.952
I'm giving the people of Illyria a choice

1:33:39.035 --> 1:33:43.623
of having a parliament
alongside the monarchy.

1:33:43.707 --> 1:33:45.625
We're more alike than you think.

1:33:45.709 --> 1:33:47.127
[chuckles]

1:33:51.256 --> 1:33:54.843
A few hours ago, a bank in Geneva
considered impenetrable was robbed.

1:33:54.926 --> 1:33:57.595
Our intel suggests the funds may be used
to finance a coup.

1:33:57.679 --> 1:34:00.974
We recovered a partial fingerprint.
It matched to our database.

1:34:01.057 --> 1:34:05.270
As you know, we have Edmond in custody,
but January remains free.

1:34:06.354 --> 1:34:08.106
She left that print on purpose.

1:34:08.189 --> 1:34:11.568
It's a message.
"Come and get me if you can."

1:34:11.651 --> 1:34:13.319
You're going to do just that.

1:34:13.403 --> 1:34:14.404
The jet is fueled.

1:34:14.487 --> 1:34:16.072
-[Matteo] Whoa. We have a jet?
-Wheels up in ten.

1:34:17.657 --> 1:34:18.658
Be careful out there.

1:34:19.576 --> 1:34:20.785
We got this, Mom.

1:34:20.869 --> 1:34:22.162
I know you do.

1:34:26.624 --> 1:34:30.170
[James] I've trained some very impressive
second-born royals in my day,

1:34:31.004 --> 1:34:35.133
but this class, they may just be
our most promising operatives yet.

1:34:36.217 --> 1:34:37.260
Pretty cool, huh?

1:34:40.597 --> 1:34:43.641
Well, what are you waiting for?
A royal invitation? Let's go.
