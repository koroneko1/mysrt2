00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
You're injured. 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.000
Press it like this. 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.000
Tian.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.000
Yang.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.000
Come here.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You stay here to serve Mr. Tian.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Mother, you know that I don't like this thing. 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.000
I won't be able to find the thing you like. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.000
You fear of losing power, 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
losing the leadership of the family because of having a son like me. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Do you remember Lady Pin?

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.000
Mr. Song ordered his son to get married before succeeding.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.000
So she immediately looked for a woman for her son.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.000
She picked Lady Pin, the daughter of Prince Pat. 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.000
I must prevent her no matter what. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
You want to destroy the wedding and find out their secret at the same time. 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.000
Will you be successful?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.500
Tian. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You're forcing me too much.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.000
If I didn't force you, 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.000
everyone would know the truth by now. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Sometimes I want everyone to know the truth. 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
What's wrong?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I don't want to discuss about this with you anymore. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Tian. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We haven't finished talking yet. 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
I didn't really eavesdrop on you. 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I searched for Nuan there because I thought she was inside. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Why would Nuan come to my room?

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Right.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.000
Why did you come into Tian's room?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I didn't.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Well, she didn't enter your room, but I think she did.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.000
Enough, Mom.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Do you have to do this out of curiosity?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
You even sneaked into Tian's room.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
You're not embarrassed but I am.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Enough, Yang.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
I apologize on behalf of my mother.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Stop please.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Aunt Chan.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.000
Don't do this again. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000
That's enough.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I'm not angry anymore.

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.000
Don't scold your mom.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000
See?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
You see that Tian isn't mad at me at all.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.000
But you keep scolding me. 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.000
You still don't get it? Tian is too kind. 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000
You're lucky that he didn't tell Madam.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
If it was me, I'd tell Madam to deal with you. 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Are you my son or my father?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000
I'd better tell Madam.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000
No, no, please.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000
You. 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.000
Alright. 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Tian, I'm sorry.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Okay. 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
I heard that Madam brought a woman to Mr. Tian.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:19.000
Did anybody see what she looks like?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.000
Is she pretty?

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.000
Me, me. 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.000
Lady Pin is beautiful, cute and sweet.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.000
As expected from a noble family member.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
I think she's the best suited for our Mr. Tian.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
The one you told me that her father has given the palace as a pledge?

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.000
Yes. 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.000
So this is called getting married to pay off debts.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
But they are a good match anyway.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:43.000
You give up. 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.000
Everyone knows that you are aiming for Mr. Tian.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000
You have no more hope.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
I didn't aim to be Mr. Tian's first wife. 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.000
Being a second wife is enough.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Don't talk to her. Let her in her daydream.

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
How is it, Commander?

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.000
It let the girls change into kimonos to please you.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Do you like it?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Yes, pretty. 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:08.000
Pretty. 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000
But not as pretty as the Japanese women in my country. 

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Then go back to your home, Jap. 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.000
What did you say?

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Cheers.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Cheers.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Chinese and Thais don't have money to come here. 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Only these guys.

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:51.000
Every time they come, they never pay a penny.

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:54.000
Before the war is over, my restaurant may have gone bust.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Don't be so upset, Madam. 

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.000
So do you got anything?

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.000
Not yet, Madam.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
In times of war like this, only the Japanese visit us.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
They didn't pay enough. 

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Mr. Ma also seemed to plan to gobble up our teahouse.

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000
If someone knows that I have borrowed money to support it, 

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.000
Cai family will definitely be kicked out of the Five Dragons Association.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Don't worry about it, Madam. 

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
I will find a way to sleep with Mr. Tian as soon as possible. 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
If I become his wife,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
I can ask him to help support your teahouse.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.000
No one would dare to stop the head of the Five Dragons Association. 

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.000
I hope so. 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
These days, when I attend the meeting of Five Dragons Association, 

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.000
no one respects me

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
or care about me.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:09.000
It's because I am a woman.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
No one listens to me when I give opinion. 

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.000
Worthless.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Madam. 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
You are a kind-hearted person.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
You are valuable to everyone here.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.000
The day that I had nothing to eat and no place to sleep. 

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
There were only you who took care of me.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
And what happened at the Song family?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Now, Madam Li has found a woman for Mr. Tian.

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:39.000
I heard that they will get married soon.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
That's no big deal.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
If you have a chance to serve Tian, 

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
I'm confident that

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
any man who sleeps with you will be fascinated.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Apply all the tricks I trained you. 

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Yes, Madam.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000
I must turn Mr. Tian into my husband.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
I won't let our sisters starve to death.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Aunt Jia who usually interfered me doesn't dare to do the same.

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:13.000
Because previously, 

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Madam Li has allowed me to approach Mr. Tian.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Madam Li has allowed you to approach Tian?

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:20.000
Right.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
That's strange.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000
A woman like Li loves Tian and treats him like mama's boy.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
You have to be careful.

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.000
I think there's something strange about it.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Yes, Madam.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
This is the tea that I bought back from abroad.

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000
I'd like to give it to you.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Thanks a lot. 

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:51.000
You are very kind. 

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
So isn't Tian home?

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
I want to ask him to accompany me to a coffee shop.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000
The shop is around the palace. 

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
He's there. 

00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.000
Tian.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Come here. 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Hello, Tian.

00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:18.000
Hi. 

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Pin visits me to give me a gift.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.000
She wants to invite you to drink coffee. 

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.000
But Iâ€¦

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
I've promised her that you will accompany her. 

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.000
So you want me to break my word?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Okay, Mother. 

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Am I bothering you?

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:49.000
Not at all.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Please. 

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:52.000
Where are you going?

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Pin, Tian. 

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000
We're going to run errands. Excuse me. 

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Let's go, Tian.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.000
Can I go with you?

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I said we were running errands.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Don't you understand?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
If you don't let me join, 

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000
I will tell Tian

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000
that the two of us have met before. 

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Tian. 

00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:29.000
You can come with us.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
More people would be fun.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Then let's go. 

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Are you ready?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Yes. 

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Let's go.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.000
This dessert is yummy, Tian. 

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.000
Take a bite. 

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.000
Thanks. 

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Let me try.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.000
Wow. 

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Tian, this is very delicious.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:50.000
Next bite. 

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
One more bite. 

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Tian.

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:32.000
Did you meet an acquaintance?

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Yang, stay here with Pin. I'll be right back. 

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000
Tian.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:35.000
Young man.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000
I'm sorry.

00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:38.000
It's okay.

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:39.000
It's okay.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000
It's okay. That's fine. 

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Pin. 

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Lady Pin, you'll hurt your neck.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.000
My brother will be back soon.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000
But actually, 

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
it's good we're alone.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000
So we can discuss now. 

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.000
What discuss? I have nothing to discuss with you. 

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Nothing to talk to me?

00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.000
Can you talk to me nicely?

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.000
In fact, you should have made friends with me.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000
I'm Tian's beloved brother. 

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.000
He believes whatever I say.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Maybe I can help you.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.000
You will help me?

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000
I could obviously see that you always disturb me and Tian.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Otherwise you probably won't come with us today.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000
Or...

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Did you change your mind?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
You want some benefits in exchange. 

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.000
Speak up.

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.000
Maybe I can give it to you. 

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.000
Me want something from you?

00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.000
I did everything because I want to protect my brother.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I've probed into your family background.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.000
And I know how your family status is now.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Your palace is now mortgaged to Madam Li. 

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
If you marry Tian, everything will be solved, right?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Aunt Li approves the relationship between me and Tian.

00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Do you think you can stop it?

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
I know that it's difficult, so I want to talk to you first.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000
My brother is a good man. 

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
I want him to love and end up with someone he pleases.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Not being forced like this.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
And how about you?

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Are you forced or are you happy with it?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
If it is the first, 

00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.000
I want you to go on and follow what you want.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
But if it's the latter, then it's unfortunate

00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.000
that someone who is well-educated like you

00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:53.000
are willing to trade everything and your own happiness for money.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
I think it's embarrassing and lacking of dignity. 

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Wait. Lady Pin. 

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Pin. 

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.000
Pin. 

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
You slip again.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Are you alright?

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Let me help. 

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Leave me alone. 

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Yang.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Yang.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Hey, let me down. 

00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.000
Stay sill. 

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Sit here.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Excuse me. 

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Does this hurt?

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Is it better?

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000
I'm sorry when I spoke badly to you.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
I'm always like this, doing whatever I want.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:31.000
I just want you to give it a try.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
How happy it is to be able to do what you want.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:40.000
You can say that because you don't have anything to carry.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000
If you don't understand what I'm saying, 

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
think of your brother.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000
I and Tian, 

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000
We are forced to do something to protect the honor of our family.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
If we can choose, 

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
we would have done everything according to our own will.

00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:04.000
No one wants to be tired of carrying all the burdens.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Be careful. 

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.000
I may have no dignity as you said. 

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
But I will do my best.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:26.000
No matter how you intervene, I don't care.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Tell Tian that I have some business, I'll leave first.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
You. 

00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000
That's blood.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
This is the wound you got from helping me the other day.

00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.000
Didn't you go to the doctor?

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.000
The wound is inflamed.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
And are the Japanese soldiers still following you?

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
If they follow you, 

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000
I can help you find a place to hide.

00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.000
You can come stay at my house.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:48.000
My house is near Song family's warehouse pier.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Or if you have trouble or need something, 

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.000
you can visit me at home.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:02.000
I just want to repay the gratitude that you have saved me.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Thanks. 

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Wait.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
My name is Tian.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Your name isâ€¦

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:20.000
I think you shouldnâ€™t know. 

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.000
We are not destined to meet each other.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Whenever we meet, there is always injury. 

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Thank you. 

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Tian. 

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Yang.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Well, I met someone who helped me the other day.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.000
So I follow to thank him.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Do you play the heroine?

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Did I tell you?

00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.000
If anyone knows this, you will be in trouble.

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.000
Remember it. Remember it. 

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.500
Madam, please stop. 

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Madam, please. Mr. Tian will die.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Emperor Ai of Han

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.000
saw his lover was still asleep on his sleeve. 

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.000
So he cut off his sleeve rather 

00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.000
than disturb the sleeping of Dong Xian, 

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:29.000
so that his lover could continue sleep comfortably.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
People use this word 

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000
to refer to a man who loves another man.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Or we call them gay. 

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Tian.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Yang.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
What's wrong with you?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Nothing. 

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000
I just want to hug you. 

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Father has scolded you so you want me to help, right?

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Tian.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Are you tired?

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.000
If I say I'm tired, 

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
will you change your mind to learn the job and help me and Father?

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
You have to carry a lot. 

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
No matter what, 

00:29:08.700 --> 00:29:11.000
I want you to know that I'm always beside you.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.000
I'll be your same old brother, Tian.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.000
I know that. 

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
So are you going to tell me now

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
what Father scold you?

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Mr. Ma is getting overconfident. 

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
And what are you going to do?

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
I think we should attack him quickly. 

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Don't let anyone catch you.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Yes, sir. 

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000
I've done what you told me. 

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Good.

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
That cop deserves to die.

00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:32.000
He received quite a lot of bribe from me. 

00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.000
He was still greedy for more money.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
He once contacted my business competitor 

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.000
to tell my business secret. 

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:45.000
Luckily, my spy reported me first.

00:31:45.700 --> 00:31:47.000
If he succeeded, 

00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:50.000
my business would have been affected a lot. 

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
You did great. 

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
When will you work for me officially?

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.000
I don't like commitment. 

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Iâ€™d rather take each job.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
That's fine. 

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:10.000
I donâ€™t want to force anyone.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
How is your sister's condition?

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Since she got the medicine from you, her condition is improving. 

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Here. 

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Take more of it. 

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000
If you run out of medicine and need more, 

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
come find me. 

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Thank you, Mr. Ma. 

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000
How are you?

00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:55.000
Is it still painful?

00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.000
After you let me take the medicine you brought, 

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
the pain has improved a lot.

00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.000
No joint pain and bone pain like before.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:05.000
That's good.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000
If I work and save a lot of money, 
355
00:33:09,000 --&gt; 00:32:10,000
I'll take you to a good doctor.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.000
So you'll be better. 

00:32:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000
You worked all day, are you tired?

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Jiu is not tired. He's good at it. 

00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.000
When I grow up, I want to be like Jiu.

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.000
Then I will help you find money to heal Mei.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000
I will work hard. 

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.000
And if I'm rich, I'll take everyone on a trip around the country. 

00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:30.000
Is it good?

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
You're injured. 

00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Press it like this. 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
My name is Tian.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Done?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
So fast. 

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Tian.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000
You're here. Come here, son.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000
I have good news for you. 

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:06.000
Li and I are able to find you an auspicious date.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Auspicious date?

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
For Wedding?

00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:14.000
Right.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Mother said that you're very fond of Lady Pin

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:21.000
and want to get married soon.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000
So I let the fortune teller to find you an auspicious date.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Mother.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Well, I've thought about it carefully, 

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
I'm not in a hurry. 

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
So what are you waiting for?

00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:42.000
If you love each other, then get married quickly.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.000
So you'll have children earlier. 

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
I want to work first. 

00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:52.000
As for marriage, we can just date. 

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Tian. 

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
According to tradition, 

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
you have to get married before assuming the position.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
You can still work after getting married. 

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
It's okay, son. 

00:36:12.300 --> 00:36:14.000
Don't hurry. 

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.000
You can date first. 

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:18.000
Because you have to get married anyway.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Mr. Tian seems to be dissatisfied with Madam Li that she speeds up the wedding.

00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:39.000
Looks like they're definitely arguing.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
So why didn't you listen until the end?

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:46.000
I hurried back and reported to you. 

00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.000
Let's go, let's listen.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Wait.

00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:53.000
Mr. Tian just caught you eavesdropping in the closet.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Don't let him catch you again.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000
Yes, Madam.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Mother.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Mother.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000
You've gone overboard.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000
You even lied to Father to speed up the wedding.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Why do you have to do this?

00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:17.000
So what are you waiting for?

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Waiting for everyone to know what you are?

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:23.000
Or waiting for Chan to push her son to take your position?

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
I just ask for some time.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.000
I know that I have to get married, 

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000
to succeed the position. 

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
But this is too soon, Mother. 

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:35.000
The faster, the better.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
Once you officially take possession of everything, 

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000
you can be anything and no one dared to talk bad about you. 

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000
So you meanâ€¦

00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000
if I get married and succeed Father, 

00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:49.000
I can be anything I like?

00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:52.000
Just don't let anyone know what you are. 

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Please listen to your mother, Mr. Tian.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
I have to live a life as a good son.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:08.000
I have to cover up and lie for the rest of my life, right?

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Not forever, Tian.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Even though you are like this, 

00:38:15.500 --> 00:38:18.000
But I've heard that a person of your type

00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.000
can get married and have heirs.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000
And if you have an heirâ€¦

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:23.800
Yes, Mother. 

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
A homosexual like me can have an heir.

00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:30.000
But I don't want to, Mother. I don't want to get married. 

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Mr. Tian is homosexual. He's gay.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000
Oh my god. 

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
Who is it?

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Mr. Tian is homosexual.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000
He likes men?

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:42.000
If this leaks out, 

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
they will be screwed. 

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Where does that mother and son go fighting?

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Nuan, you should follow them.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:03.000
See? We miss them.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Madam Chan.

00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:09.000
Madam Chan.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Madam Chan.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Madam Chan. 

00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.000
Dong. 

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:21.000
You frighten me. 

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000
I have important matter to discuss.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Why did you tell Madam?

00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.000
You'd better tell Madam Li and Mr. Tian.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.000
Madam Chan is just a mistress.

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.000
Nuan, are you cursing me again?

00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.000
Huh?

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:34.000
But this is important.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
You must be curious for sure. 

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
I don't want to know, I'm busy right now.

00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.000
It's about Mr. Tian.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
If this leaks out, 

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.000
Mr. Tian will definitely be removed from the leader position.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Do you know the secret already?

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000
What does Tian do?

00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Tell me now. Tell me now.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Before I got this information, 

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
I had to risk myself as well.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:09.000
If you have some compensation for meâ€¦

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Tell me how much you want.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
What are you guys doing here?

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000
I called Dong to do something for me.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Dong, let's go that way.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000
What business do you have with him?

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000
I don't see you do anything every day. 

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:00.000
Dong. 

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Come with me. I have a job for you.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Hey, Madam. 

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.000
Didn't you hear it?

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
I said I would let him do my job.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Dong. 

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Who will you choose to listen to?

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Me as a first madam?

00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:20.000
Or a mistress like her?

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Madam Li. 

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:57.000
What are we going to do?

00:42:57.500 --> 00:42:59.000
What secret is Dong going to tell you?

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Let's go eavesdrop.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Why does old Jia have to stand guard like that?

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
What were you going to tell Chan just now?

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Why?

00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:37.000
You can talk to Chan, but not first madam like me?

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Nuan, do you here it?

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:44.000
I can't hear a thing. Do you hear it?

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
If I hear it, will I ask you?

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000
I told you to speak. 

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:01.000
I've heard that Mr. Tian said he was a homosexual.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Madam. 

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Ten years ago.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Mr. Zhang was condemned for being a homosexual until his life was destroyed.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000
He died of suicide. 

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:17.000
The blood stains are still here until now. 

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:20.000
If the truth about Mr. Tian leaks out, 

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
it will be a big deal.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Oh I understand now. 

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000
So you rushed to tell Chan. 

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Madam. 

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
This is bad. He will disgrace the family name. 

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
I'm just worried about Song family.

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:42.000
You are only a worker.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
Don't pretend to love and want to protect my family.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
As for Tian, 

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
you don't have evidence.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Who would believe a worker like you?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Perhaps, 

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.000
you could be fired for insulting Tian. 

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
There is no need for evidence.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000
If I spread this news, 

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
others will find a way to prove the truth.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Whether it is Madam Chan or someone from the Five Dragons Association.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Everyone knew that people in Five Dragons Association aren't that close.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
You only think of a way to overthrow each other. 

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
With the scandal of Mr. Tian being a homosexual, a gay, 

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000
I think Song family would surely perish.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000
I assure you that it will be more devastating than Mr. Zhang's scandal.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:37.000
Dong. 

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
You must have forgotten

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
that I'm the first madam here.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
I have a lot more money than Chan.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000
How much do you want?

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000
Then shut your mouth tightly.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000
What are you laughing at?

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
You offer me the money to cover my mouth like this.

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
I feel more assured that 

00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:08.000
Mr. Tian's secret is true.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Thank you, Madam. 

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Let me think about it first

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
how much I should take. 

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Let's go.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Move. 

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
What's the heck?

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Mud. 

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Let's go to the market with me. 

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:58.000
Whatever you want, I'll buy it for you. 

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:00.000
I'm not going.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
I have to stay here to serve Mr. Tian.

00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:04.000
In case he requests me. 

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Mr. Tian?

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Mud. 

00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.000
Mr. Tian doesn't like you. 

00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:17.000
Don't dream too high. 

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000
Do you mean that he has a fiancÃ© already?

00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:25.000
I already know about that.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
But I don't care.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000
I'd rather be Mr. Tian's mistress than be your wife.

00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.000
Mud. 

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
I also have money.

00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.000
How much do you want?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Let go of me. Annoying. 

00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:40.000
Mud. 

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Mr. Tian. 

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
If you don't like Lady Pin, 

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
tell Madam Li what kind of woman you like.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
So she can to find someone new for you. 

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Bua.

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Don't look for any woman for now.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
If Tian doesn't want to get married, then he doesn't have to. 

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Don't worry, Tian.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000
I'm here by your side. 

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:18.000
I'm not going to let anyone force you.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.000
We got a lot of things to do in our lives.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.000
I don't see the need to get married at all.

00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:25.000
I understand what you said. 

00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:30.000
But traditionally, if you will succeed your father, 

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000
you have to get married and have children.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Bua.

00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:55.000
Sit down. Come on. 

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Tian will be the first association leader who doesn't have to marry and have children.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.000
What are you saying?

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:09.000
Sooner or later, Mr. Tian has to get married.

00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:12.000
He'll meet a woman that he likes and has children anyway.

00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:14.000
Even if it's not Lady Pin. 

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Right?

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Oh, it's not always true.

00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:25.000
Not everyone has to get married.

00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:27.000
Right, brother?

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
If you don't like it, you don't have to get married. 

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:32.000
That's enough.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Okay? We'll stop talking about the future

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
and talk about the present only.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:42.000
As for Pin, don't worry. I'll handle it myself.

00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:44.000
If she comes here, 

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:47.000
I would tease her and drive her back to her palace in no time.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:50.000
That's my job. 

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
You help Tian like this.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
If Chan knows, will you be scolded?

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000
No. 

00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:04.000
My mother doesn't want Tian to get married either.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000
What is it?

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:28.000
You know what it is.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Aren't you going to tell Tian's secret?

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:39.000
Tell me then. 

00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:43.000
Secret? What secret?

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Did you misunderstand?

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Do we misunderstand?

00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:52.000
Is it too little?

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
How much do you want?

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000
This is a serious matter.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.000
If you don't have enough money, 

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
I don't dare to risk.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Madam Li must have given him money to keep your mouth shut.

00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:20.000
How much money do I need to let him tell me?

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Dong. 

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
I saw that Madam Chan talked to you. 

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
It's good you see it.

00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.000
So you'll know that I don't have a loose tongue. 

00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.000
Good. 

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.000
I just want to warn you that no matter how much Chan pay you, 

00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:50.000
Don't even think about revealing it. 

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Are you threatening?

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000
I'm the one who is at an advantage. 

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Because I hold your Tian's secret.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
If you want me to keep my mouth shut, 

00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:02.000
it's not hard at all.

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Just give me enough money, don't forget.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
What should I do?

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Lady Pin. 

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000
I'd like to talk to you.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Why are you saying this, Mr. Yang?

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
What's wrong with me?

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Pin. 

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:03.000
It's not that you're bad, butâ€¦

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Tian doesn't really like you.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000
You insult me again. 

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:09.000
What insult?

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:13.000
I may not be as cute and sweet as other women.

00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.000
But that doesn't mean that Tian has no way of liking me.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Why?

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Or...

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Tian has a lover already. 

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Does this mean that I will have to separate them?

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
I don't want to be a bad woman. 

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Oh my god. 

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:39.000
You're babbling things. 

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:40.000
Oh. 

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Well, you refuse to tell me

00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:45.000
why Tian won't love me.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
So I have to keep guessing like this.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Orâ€¦

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Tian has a child?

00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:55.000
No, he doesn't. 

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Tian is sterile?

00:53:57.200 --> 00:53:58.000
He isn't. 

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Or...

00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:02.000
Don't say anymore. 

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Mr. Tian, there is a trouble at home. 

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Stop it.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
It's none of your business. Get out. 

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000
You said I'm harassing your wife?

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Harassing your wife?

00:54:56.500 --> 00:54:57.000
Harassing your wife?

00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.000
Harassing your wife?

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Harassing?

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.000
Stop now. Stop.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
I told you to stop.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Why do you have to do this?

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Why didn't talk nicely?

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
He said that I touched his wife.

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:27.000
So I just gave him a lesson. 

00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.000
You grabbed my wife's butt.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Everyone saw that. 

00:55:31.800 --> 00:55:33.000
I didn't accuse you. 

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:34.000
Everyone just misunderstood.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000
I just helped dust off the dust on his wife's butt. That's all.

00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.000
Everyone saw this clearly and you still lie?

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Very brave of you. 

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:51.000
But I'm not as brave as you. 

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.000
What are you doing?

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Dong. 

00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:56.000
This is Mr. Tian.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Why so rude?

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:01.000
In the past, 

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
I must be too kind.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
You got problem at work.

00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Not only petty theft, but you also causes issues every day.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000
If I keep you here, 

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
it's going to be a bad example for everyone.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
From now on, 

00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:22.000
you were no longer a worker of the Song Family.

00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:25.000
Either here or at the warehouse.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Do you dare to kick me out?

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
It serves you right. 

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000
So you know that you're just a scum bag.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Arrogant. 

00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Tian.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Did you fire Dong?

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.000
Yes, Mother. 

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Dong harassed other worker

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000
and hurt others even though he was wrong. 

00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:13.000
He is also aggressive towards me.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.000
If I keep him, 

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.000
he would be a bad example to others.

00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.000
If it were you, what would you say?

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000
You need to be calm. Don't use your emotion.

00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:38.000
I think...

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000
It might be a misunderstanding.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Dong has been working with us for a long time.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
He shouldn't be that bad. 

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.000
We should give him another chance.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
I'll handle this matter myself. 

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Pack your things and go back to your room, Dong. 

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Mr. Tian, Mr. Tian.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Have some snacks to lift up your mood. 

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Thank you so much. 

00:58:58.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Tian.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
I've heard about it. 

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Let's fight Dong. 

00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:07.000
I'm going to punch him in the face for you.

00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:09.000
That's good, Mr. Yang. Go on. 

00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:11.000
But wait, don't go yet. 

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
You have to disguise yourself first. If you go like this, 

00:59:14.700 --> 00:59:17.000
Mr. Song saw will scold you for having a fight again. 

00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000
That's right. Wait a moment.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000
Dong, that bastard. 

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.000
Do you recognize my face?

00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Do you still recognize me?

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Snake, it's a snake.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Mr. Yang.

00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:58.000
You're scared of only a rope.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
And you're going to have a fight with someone else?

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:09.000
You see that I'm scared of snakes and you tease me. 

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000
But forget it, 

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000
If it can make you smile and happy, 

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:21.000
I can do this a hundred times.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Look at you. 

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Acting like a child.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:29.000
You encouraged me to do so.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Who knows that you are easily encouraged?

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Mr. Tian, you smile and happy now.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
But there's still another matter.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
I can't help but wonder.

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Mother allows Dong to stay despite being aggressive.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000
That's not like her. 

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.000
It's strange, Madam. 

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.000
How could Madam Li allow Dong to do this?

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Usually, she must have beaten and kicked him out already. 

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
A fool like you can still see it.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
I guess this must be about a secret he knows for sure.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
A family brooch.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Why do you take it out?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.000
No, Madam. 

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
I'll buy Dong with my most precious thing.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Please think carefully.

01:02:01.700 --> 01:02:05.000
This brooch was given to you by your father before he passed away. 

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000
If we want him to spit it out, I can pay anything. 

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Oh, Madam.

01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:16.000
Didn't you say you would keep this last treasure for Mr. Yang

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:19.000
to let him gift his woman in the future?

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:23.000
If you give Dong this one, you can't find another replacement.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I can do everything for my son.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Are these the beetle orchids?

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000
Yes, Madam.

01:02:57.600 --> 01:02:59.000
They will solve the problem for us.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Do we have to do this?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
We have no other choice, Madam. 

01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Don't be angry at me, Father. 

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.000
I'm sorry.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Oh, you bring your father's treasure to buy the secret.

01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:55.000
I don't know if you can buy Dong. 

01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:57.000
Why do you speak loudly?

01:03:57.700 --> 01:03:59.000
Others will hear it and tell Madam Li. 

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Dong. 

01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:08.000
Dong. 

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Dong. 

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Dong. 

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Where did he go?

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.000
You called me out. What's the matter?

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Today you were too aggressive to Tian. I can't accept it. 

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I will give you a sum of money and then get out of here.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000
I'm sorry, Madam. 

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:59.000
I will never come back here again.

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Why do I have to leave, Madam?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
I can use up this sum of money in no time.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.000
I'd better live here and have enough money for the rest of my life.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Anyway, you shall prepare another sum of money for me tomorrow. 

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
I need to use money lately.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
I consider thatâ€¦

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000
I have given you a chance, Dong. 

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Why?

01:05:35.300 --> 01:05:36.000
What will you do?

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Are you going to kill me?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Jia.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Madam, wait for me.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:35.800
Dong. 

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:37.000
Dong. 

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Dong, are you here?

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:40.000
He's not here.

01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:42.000
If he was here, he would probably answer you. 

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:43.000
I know.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:46.000
Madam Li may call Dong to talk to around here. 

01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:50.000
If she hears me, she'll know that I already knew what she was doing. 

01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:51.000
Yes, Madam.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Dong. 

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Dong. 

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Dong. 

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Dong. 

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Dong. 

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
Madam Chan.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000
Dong. 

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Dong. 

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:45.800
Dong. 

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Bua.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Did you see Dong pass by?

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I don't see him.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:53.000
Are you sure you didn't see him?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.000
It's not that you saw him but intended to hide that. 

01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.000
Hey, what are you doing in the late night. You're suspicious.

01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:01.000
One of my clothes was missing, so I went out to collect it.

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.000
And if I really see Dong, 

01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.000
why do I hide it?

01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.800
You are on Madam Li's side. Acting like a good person.

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Once Madam Chan buys Dong, 

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:10.000
she'll drive you all away.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Madamâ€¦

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Chan.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.000
Dong's voice.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000
Madam Chan.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Where are you going?

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
I heard Dong's voice coming from here.

01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:44.000
Are you sure?

01:08:45.300 --> 01:08:46.000
Come with me.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Yes, Madam.

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000
I didn't see anyone, 

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:00.000
and I didn't hear anyone either. 

01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Mr. Song, something bad happened. 

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Do you have to kill him, Madam?

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Stop now.

01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Don't come here again.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:21.000
Why?

01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:25.000
I will prove that she killed people to hide a secret for Tian.
