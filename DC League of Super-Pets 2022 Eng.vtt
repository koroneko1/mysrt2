[siren blaring]

33:29.877 --> 33:31.661
[groaning]

33:33.098 --> 33:34.316
Superman!

33:34.360 --> 33:35.404
-I have to find...
-[bones cracking]

33:35.448 --> 33:37.015
[groaning]

33:38.103 --> 33:39.408
[sighs softly]

33:42.933 --> 33:45.110
-[collar chiming]
-Huh?

33:47.242 --> 33:48.287
[Krypto gasps]

33:48.330 --> 33:49.549
Father.

33:49.592 --> 33:53.074
Yes, it is I, Dog-El.

33:53.118 --> 33:54.728
When you were just a puppy,

33:54.771 --> 33:58.079
I recorded all my knowledge
in your collar.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.734
I know. You've always
helped me in the past,

34:00.777 --> 34:02.257
and I could
really use you now.

34:02.301 --> 34:05.565
Yes, it is I, Dog-El.

34:05.608 --> 34:07.654
We really need
a skip-intro button.

34:07.697 --> 34:11.745
Talk to me, my son.
What seems to be the problem?

34:11.788 --> 34:14.139
Superman.
He's been captured.

34:15.357 --> 34:16.880
[Dog-El] Hmm.

34:16.924 --> 34:20.667
I'm sorry.
I know how close you are.

34:20.710 --> 34:23.670
Yeah, I mean, we were.

34:23.713 --> 34:26.455
Well, you just can't sit there
feeling sad.

34:26.499 --> 34:28.501
You have to go rescue him.

34:28.544 --> 34:29.850
You're right.

34:29.893 --> 34:31.721
I'll save Superman,
and when I do,

34:31.765 --> 34:34.463
he'll realize that
I'm the only friend
he ever needs.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.770
Uh... That's not
exactly what I--

34:36.813 --> 34:38.467
But how am I
supposed to be a hero

34:38.511 --> 34:40.295
when I don't have my powers?

34:40.339 --> 34:43.516
It's not superpowers
that make you a hero, Krypto.

34:43.559 --> 34:45.213
That's not your problem.

34:45.257 --> 34:47.085
Then what is it?

34:47.128 --> 34:49.130
Your problem is you.
You...[echoes]

34:49.174 --> 34:51.698
Me? What do you mean, me?
Father?

34:54.527 --> 34:56.094
-[dramatic music playing]
-[electricity crackling]

34:57.007 --> 34:58.139
A-ha!

34:58.183 --> 35:00.446
That must be the vile rodent.

35:00.489 --> 35:01.751
Don't worry, Superman,

35:01.795 --> 35:03.492
I won't rest
until I rescue you.

35:05.233 --> 35:07.235
[yawns]

35:07.279 --> 35:09.194
This is very restful.

35:09.237 --> 35:10.499
-Yes.
-[crackling]

35:12.458 --> 35:14.373
[screams]

35:15.896 --> 35:17.202
[chuckles sheepishly] Whoops.

35:17.245 --> 35:19.117
[Ace] We're gonna
have to work on that.

35:19.160 --> 35:22.207
I never knew the stars
could be this beautiful,

35:22.250 --> 35:23.860
and there's so many of them.

35:23.904 --> 35:25.906
Look, there's one.
Oh, there's another one.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.603
[chuckles]
Look, there's one, too.

35:27.647 --> 35:31.477
Eh! These stars are crap.
Wait till we get to the farm.

35:31.520 --> 35:35.350
Yeah. [sighs] Everything's
better at the farm.

35:35.394 --> 35:37.483
Oh! Oh, yeah.

35:37.526 --> 35:39.180
Um, yeah, about...
about the farm.

35:39.224 --> 35:40.486
See, understand this.

35:40.529 --> 35:42.488
There's always
a literal interpretation

35:42.531 --> 35:43.880
and then... and then a more--

35:43.924 --> 35:46.361
[Krypto panting] Where is she?
Where...?

35:46.405 --> 35:48.798
Where...? [breathes deeply]

35:48.842 --> 35:50.931
Okay. Where... Where is she?

35:50.974 --> 35:52.933
[panting]

35:52.976 --> 35:55.240
-[panting] Okay. Where is she?
-[dramatic music swells]

35:55.283 --> 35:56.676
-[all gasp]
-[Chip] Ugh.

35:56.719 --> 35:58.460
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

35:58.504 --> 36:02.160
I've, uh, I've never
really run before. [panting]

36:02.203 --> 36:04.771
[weakly] I... I usually
"Pup, up, and away."

36:06.076 --> 36:07.339
Are you okay?

36:07.382 --> 36:09.079
[in normal voice]
I'm fine, I'm fine.

36:09.123 --> 36:11.995
I was just, uh,
hit by a car a little.

36:12.039 --> 36:15.216
[sighs] You never forget
your first time.

36:18.872 --> 36:20.830
Wait a minute,
where do I know you from?

36:20.874 --> 36:22.180
I can't put my paw on it.

36:22.223 --> 36:23.703
-Where is she?
-[gasps, yelps]

36:23.746 --> 36:24.878
[dramatic music swells]

36:27.185 --> 36:31.363
Whoa. So, the powers
I saw were yours?

36:31.406 --> 36:33.234
You hooligans can help me.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.065
Hurry, there isn't much time.
We have to save Superman.

36:38.108 --> 36:39.284
Superman?

36:39.327 --> 36:41.329
[heroic music playing]

36:41.373 --> 36:43.288
Oh, of course!
You're that super dork

36:43.331 --> 36:45.072
who got me
thrown back in the slammer.

36:45.115 --> 36:47.683
What was it? Creepo? Crisco?
What's your name?

36:47.727 --> 36:50.730
No. It's Krypto the Superdog!

36:50.773 --> 36:52.253
[Ace] Oh!

36:52.297 --> 36:53.820
Well, it looks like
we're both super now.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.474
You know,
I still owe you a whuppin'.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.258
-Hi-yah!
-Ow!

36:57.302 --> 36:58.868
That was my good eye.

36:58.912 --> 37:00.914
Now, wait. It was supposed
to be a fair fight.

37:00.957 --> 37:02.611
Why didn't you block me
with some freeze heat

37:02.655 --> 37:04.222
that was coming out your ears
or something?

37:04.265 --> 37:06.006
Because, I... [sighs] I...

37:06.049 --> 37:08.356
[mumbling]
I don't have my powers.

37:08.400 --> 37:10.184
-What?
-[amusing music playing]

37:10.228 --> 37:13.056
I said I don't
have my powers anymore.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.407
[laughing] Did ya...?

37:15.450 --> 37:16.756
You don't have your powers?

37:17.844 --> 37:19.106
Yeah, that's what's going on.

37:19.149 --> 37:20.542
You're just trying
to use us now,

37:20.586 --> 37:22.501
because you can't handle it
on your own.

37:22.544 --> 37:24.633
Look, I know these powers
are new to you,

37:24.677 --> 37:27.419
but when one has an abundance
of power... [groans]

37:27.462 --> 37:30.552
...they have a certain duty
to use that power to--

37:30.596 --> 37:32.119
-[Ace urinating]
-[heroic music stops]

37:35.209 --> 37:37.255
Sorry. You were
sayin' somethin'?

37:39.518 --> 37:42.564
I was making
an inspiring hero speech.

37:42.608 --> 37:44.262
[Ace continues urinating]

37:47.743 --> 37:49.484
How much did you
have to drink?

37:49.528 --> 37:51.921
I had two toilet bowls
and a bidet.

37:51.965 --> 37:53.314
A bidet, too, which is,
which is crazy.

37:53.358 --> 37:54.707
I didn't even know
that was a thing.

37:54.750 --> 37:56.317
But it's like
a dog water fountain.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.493
You disgusting animal.

37:58.537 --> 38:00.060
Pack, let's roll out.

38:00.103 --> 38:02.323
I'll see you never, Narc Kent.

38:02.367 --> 38:04.456
No! My best friend
is in danger,

38:04.499 --> 38:06.153
and you have to help me.

38:06.196 --> 38:08.024
[Ace] Sorry,
we got other plans.

38:08.068 --> 38:11.463
Good luck with your danger.
We're going to the farm.

38:11.506 --> 38:15.118
Oh, yeah! Lettuce trees, baby!

38:15.162 --> 38:17.686
"Lettuce trees"?
What's this farm called?

38:17.730 --> 38:19.166
The farm upstate.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.690
That sounds made-up.

38:21.734 --> 38:23.518
Oh, yeah?
Well, how would you know?

38:23.562 --> 38:26.652
I grew up on a farm.
In a town called Smallville.

38:26.695 --> 38:28.871
Now that sounds made-up.

38:28.915 --> 38:32.440
So, which way
is this so-called farm?

38:32.484 --> 38:34.137
Well, it's upstate.

38:34.181 --> 38:36.836
So, that... that means
it's... it's up, obviously.

38:36.879 --> 38:38.664
Okay. He's not
telling you the--

38:38.707 --> 38:40.143
[Ace] Can I steal you
for a sec?

38:42.711 --> 38:44.278
You lied about the farm,
didn't you?

38:44.322 --> 38:47.150
Big time. Look, I had
to give them some hope.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.283
-There's one there.
-[Ace] No one was ever
gonna adopt us.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.893
There's one, too.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.548
So, I promised them
it would be their new home.

38:56.290 --> 38:59.293
You know, I'd be happy
to take you and your friends
to my farm.

39:01.295 --> 39:04.080
If you help me save Superman.

39:04.124 --> 39:06.692
Wait a minute.
Is this blackmail?
Are you blackmailing me?

39:06.735 --> 39:08.781
No. I'm just asking you
for something,

39:08.824 --> 39:12.175
which I will reward you for
by not revealing
damaging information.

39:12.219 --> 39:15.353
That is literally
the definition of blackmail.

39:15.396 --> 39:18.486
Fine. We'll help you
get your dumb owner back.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.749
You got yourself a super team.

39:20.793 --> 39:22.969
[heroic music swells, stops]

39:23.012 --> 39:24.536
Did someone
just say super team?

39:24.579 --> 39:27.495
[Chip muffled] Yay.
My destiny awaits.

39:29.497 --> 39:31.891
-[sinister music playing]
-[Lulu] Terrifying villains,

39:31.934 --> 39:33.806
deadly assassins,

39:33.849 --> 39:36.199
I have come to recruit you

39:36.243 --> 39:39.638
for a siege
of murderous savagery!

39:39.681 --> 39:42.423
[all munching]

39:42.467 --> 39:45.121
My fellow, furrier,
guinea pigs.

39:45.165 --> 39:48.429
I have sought you out
because you are
apex predators.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.300
Gods amongst men!

39:50.344 --> 39:51.998
[all munching]

39:54.696 --> 39:58.091
Okay, look. Pig to pig,
I need your help

39:58.134 --> 40:00.049
because my owner
has gotten himself

40:00.093 --> 40:02.661
into a bit of a pickle.

40:02.704 --> 40:04.271
[reporter] Thwarted by
the Justice League,

40:04.314 --> 40:07.056
Lex Luthor now
finds himself behind bars.

40:07.100 --> 40:09.058
I'll destroy you all!

40:09.102 --> 40:10.495
That's my best friend.
[chuckles]

40:10.538 --> 40:12.192
And mentor.
Best friend and mentor.

40:14.455 --> 40:16.501
[clears throat]

40:16.544 --> 40:18.720
[reporter] Built to house
fearsome superpowered
criminals,

40:18.764 --> 40:20.069
Stryker's Island
is the world's most

40:20.113 --> 40:21.680
inescapable prison.

40:21.723 --> 40:24.073
Which is where
you dorks come in.

40:24.117 --> 40:26.859
You see, if I'm gonna get Lex
outta that dump,

40:26.902 --> 40:28.469
I'm gonna need an army.

40:28.513 --> 40:30.340
[cages rattling]

40:30.384 --> 40:32.038
[guinea pigs squeaking]

40:32.081 --> 40:35.520
Um, actually, I think
we'd just rather stay here.

40:35.563 --> 40:37.043
Yeah, I mean,
we get summers off,

40:37.086 --> 40:38.392
all-you-can-drink water.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.002

40:42.527 --> 40:45.921
We even have Spanish class
every miercoles.

40:45.965 --> 40:48.358
Oh, you have nothing...
until you've licked

40:48.402 --> 40:51.666
from the cold steel
straw of power.

[dramatic music playing]

41:01.502 --> 41:02.851
Not so fast.

41:02.895 --> 41:05.550
Lois Lane told us
all about you, hamster.

41:05.593 --> 41:09.205
Hamster? A hamster is a...
is a hacky sack!

41:09.249 --> 41:11.991
A hamster is a mouse
that had too much for lunch!

41:12.034 --> 41:13.862
We are guinea pigs

41:13.906 --> 41:16.169
and when we're through
with you, buster,
you'll know it.

41:16.212 --> 41:17.387
Hmm.

41:19.520 --> 41:21.827
[dramatic music intensifies]

41:33.055 --> 41:34.361
[guinea pig growls]

41:40.019 --> 41:42.412
What's going on?
That was your cue to attack.

41:42.456 --> 41:45.111
Uh... Oh, sorry.
I... I was waiting
for him to go first.

41:45.154 --> 41:47.287
Yeah, but if I went first,
your fire would melt my ice,

41:47.330 --> 41:49.594
so maybe the... the wing lady
should go first?

41:49.637 --> 41:50.856
I have a name.

41:50.899 --> 41:52.901
But then I'd set
her wings on fire,

41:52.945 --> 41:54.512
and I don't think
any of us want that.

41:54.555 --> 41:56.644
Well, you don't want
ice on wings.

41:56.688 --> 41:58.298
-[guinea pig 1] Why?
-[guinea pig 2] They...
It clogs the feathers.

41:58.341 --> 41:59.865
Just get him!

Whoo! That was fun.

42:13.356 --> 42:15.968
Now then, let's go free Lex.

42:17.360 --> 42:18.797
Huh?

42:18.840 --> 42:20.538
[screams]

42:20.581 --> 42:22.801
[tires screeching]

42:23.932 --> 42:25.325
This ends now, sister.

42:25.368 --> 42:27.849
I have you
in my Lasso of Truth.

42:27.893 --> 42:29.764
Oh, you want the truth?

42:29.808 --> 42:31.505
The boots are a bit much.

42:43.952 --> 42:45.954
Is this really the best way
to find Superman?

42:45.998 --> 42:47.869
Because to me,
this just seems gross.

42:47.913 --> 42:49.697
What do you mean, gross?

42:49.741 --> 42:51.569
Smelling stuff is
one of the greatest joys
of being a dog.

42:51.612 --> 42:53.309
Next to licking
any part of your body.

42:53.353 --> 42:55.094
I mean, I lick myself
all the time.

42:55.137 --> 42:56.922
Well, that explains
the breath.

42:56.965 --> 42:59.402
You wanna find Lulu
and rescue
Captain Hair Gel, right?

42:59.446 --> 43:01.317
Well, I suggest
you start sniffing.

43:01.361 --> 43:02.580
You know what they say,

43:02.623 --> 43:05.017
smell is the sight
of the nose.

43:05.060 --> 43:06.366
No one says that.

43:06.409 --> 43:07.672
Well, they should. Check it.

43:07.715 --> 43:09.674
[sniffs] Uh-huh.

43:09.717 --> 43:12.154
A poodle drooled right here.

43:12.198 --> 43:14.635
[sniffs] Someone threw
a perfectly good pizza crust
in that dumpster right there.

43:14.679 --> 43:17.072
[sniffs] And on that corner...

43:17.116 --> 43:19.379
[sniffs] That corner
right there... Oh, no. Dang.

43:19.422 --> 43:21.642
A pigeon got her heart broken.
I can still smell the hurt.

43:21.686 --> 43:23.557
[sniffs] She was a heavy crier.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.038
It's a superpower
that every dog possesses.

43:26.081 --> 43:27.561
Even a wack one like you.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.650
-[scoffs] I'm not wack.
-[sniffs]

43:29.694 --> 43:31.217
[sniffs] Oh!

43:32.914 --> 43:35.003
[dry heaving]

43:35.047 --> 43:36.483
[Ace] Ooh, is that a band-aid?

43:36.526 --> 43:39.529
[gags, groans]

43:42.184 --> 43:46.362
-[dog panting]
-[bell tolling]

43:46.406 --> 43:48.582
-[sighs]
-[sentimental music playing]

43:48.626 --> 43:51.411
-It's walk-o'clock.
-What-oh-what?

43:51.454 --> 43:53.195
-Nothing.
-Okay.

43:53.239 --> 43:55.284
Because it sounded like
a super adorable nickname

43:55.328 --> 43:57.156
you got for your walks
with your owner.

43:57.199 --> 44:01.639
All right, maybe this is when
me and Supes used to hang out.

44:01.682 --> 44:04.076
Every morning,
since I was a puppy.

44:04.119 --> 44:06.948
Aw! Well, you might
not have your Superman,

44:06.992 --> 44:08.515
but at least you have us.

44:08.558 --> 44:10.648
-A whole super team!
-[heroic music playing]

44:10.691 --> 44:12.606
The Mighty Oink!

44:12.650 --> 44:13.999
Squirrelverine.

44:14.913 --> 44:16.436
Droolo.

44:16.479 --> 44:17.829
Seriously? Droolo?

44:17.872 --> 44:19.874
And wait, where's
Shell-on-wheels? Shell?

44:19.918 --> 44:21.136
[Merton laughing]

44:21.180 --> 44:23.182
What's happenin',
sweet cheeks?

44:23.225 --> 44:25.140
[romantic music playing]

44:25.184 --> 44:28.535
Ah, I get it.
The strong, silent type.

44:28.578 --> 44:30.842
Who needs words?

44:30.885 --> 44:33.018
Man, I wish
I still had my powers.

44:33.061 --> 44:34.759
Yeah, what happened
to them anyway?

44:34.802 --> 44:36.238
I ate some green kryptonite.

44:36.282 --> 44:38.806
A Kryptonian's only weakness.

44:38.850 --> 44:41.287
Why would you eat
your weakness, you dum-dum?

44:41.330 --> 44:43.724
It was in some cheese.

44:43.768 --> 44:46.553
A dog's only weakness.

44:46.596 --> 44:48.598
Well, I ate
a toy dinosaur once.

44:48.642 --> 44:51.036
If we're goin' off that,
I'd say you probably
got a solid two days

44:51.079 --> 44:52.733
until that thing passes.

44:52.777 --> 44:54.996
Unless it's a stegosaurus,
and then you just pray.

44:55.040 --> 44:56.563
-[people screaming on tv]
-You guys, look!

45:00.741 --> 45:02.482
[foreboding music playing]

45:02.525 --> 45:04.702
M'kay, Wonder Woman
will stop her. [gasps]

45:06.399 --> 45:07.661
Goddess, no!

45:09.619 --> 45:10.664
Um...

45:13.667 --> 45:15.016
That sounded
like a bone breaking.

45:16.801 --> 45:18.411
Is that even how it works?

45:22.502 --> 45:24.591
I guess it's down to us.

45:24.634 --> 45:26.941
Who's ready to go
save my best friend?

45:26.985 --> 45:29.639
You want us to fight her?
[shudders]

45:29.683 --> 45:32.077
She just took out
the whole Justice League!

45:32.120 --> 45:34.601
And they all
have opposable thumbs.

45:34.644 --> 45:38.518
[sighs] Remember me
when I'm gone, Fabrizio.

45:42.435 --> 45:45.133
Guys, relax. We'll be fine.

45:45.917 --> 45:47.353
[screaming]

45:48.833 --> 45:50.312
[sinister music playing]

45:50.356 --> 45:52.314

45:52.358 --> 45:54.664
[people screaming]

45:54.708 --> 45:55.927
[roars]

45:57.537 --> 45:59.278
You see? Totally fine.

46:00.845 --> 46:03.630
-Now, let's hero up.
-[heroic music playing]

46:03.673 --> 46:05.675
All right, team,
what are your stats?

46:05.719 --> 46:08.243
Like, my powers include
heat vision, freeze breath...

46:08.287 --> 46:10.637
And don't forget
the Solar Paw Punch.

46:12.421 --> 46:13.814
What is that?

46:13.858 --> 46:15.990
Is that like a juice box
flavor or something?

46:16.034 --> 46:19.559
No, it's Krypto's
most powerful move.

46:19.602 --> 46:22.127
It requires him
to fly directly to the sun

46:22.170 --> 46:24.390
and absorb
its deadly radiation,

46:24.433 --> 46:25.870
turning himself into

46:25.913 --> 46:29.090
a dog-shaped
thermal energy event.

46:29.134 --> 46:32.441
Not even Superman himself
has tried it.

46:32.485 --> 46:34.269
Because he doesn't have paws?

46:34.313 --> 46:36.706
Because it's not something
you come back from.

46:36.750 --> 46:38.926
The punch causes a blast
which takes out

46:38.970 --> 46:40.885
not only the villain
who gets hit with the blow,

46:40.928 --> 46:43.670
but the hero who throws it.

46:43.713 --> 46:45.498
Sounds like a terrible power.

46:45.541 --> 46:46.716
Does sound like
a good juice box, though.

46:46.760 --> 46:48.283
I would drink the juice box.

46:48.327 --> 46:51.025
Okay, enough mayhem.
Thank you. We gotta go...

46:51.983 --> 46:54.333
My goodness! [laughs]

46:54.376 --> 46:56.291
Look who's alive!

46:56.335 --> 46:58.859
Well, let's correct that
little oversight, shall we?

46:58.903 --> 47:00.121
[whistles menacingly]

47:02.515 --> 47:03.995
[guinea pigs snarling]

47:08.216 --> 47:09.827
Ace, deploy canine shield.

47:09.870 --> 47:11.263
What is a canine...? [screams]

47:11.306 --> 47:12.742
[all screaming]

47:16.094 --> 47:17.051
Evade!

47:21.099 --> 47:22.361
Excellent shielding.

47:22.404 --> 47:24.319
That seemed
incredibly painful.

47:24.363 --> 47:25.494
[Ace groans]

47:25.538 --> 47:27.453
Anybody wanna switch powers?

47:29.411 --> 47:30.543
You're up, pig.

47:30.586 --> 47:32.588
Okay, PB, think big!

[crackling]

47:46.341 --> 47:48.474
[guinea pigs snarling]

47:48.517 --> 47:50.345
No, no, no. I can't.

47:50.389 --> 47:51.781
Of course you can.

47:51.825 --> 47:53.305
I mean, what's the worst
that could happen?

47:53.348 --> 47:56.699
I could hurt someone.
Or they could hurt me.

47:56.743 --> 47:59.964
Or maybe me freezing like this
is the worst thing.

48:00.007 --> 48:01.356
[screams]

48:04.446 --> 48:05.621
Turtle, use your speed
and get them--

48:05.665 --> 48:06.709
On it.

48:17.155 --> 48:18.678

48:18.721 --> 48:20.941
[sighs] You guys are
terrible superheroes.

48:20.985 --> 48:24.553
[scoffs] I don't understand
why you're not getting this.

48:24.597 --> 48:27.687
Yeah, well, there's a lot
that you don't understand
about us, you fool.

48:27.730 --> 48:29.515
Maybe if you
paid attention to... Huh?

48:29.558 --> 48:31.386
-Oh, I'm paying attention.
-[groans] Help.

48:31.430 --> 48:32.953
One-hundo percent attention.

48:32.997 --> 48:35.521
So thick and swole, his abs.

-His abs.

-[straining]

48:58.979 --> 49:00.807

49:00.850 --> 49:02.417
Where is Superman?

49:02.461 --> 49:04.942
[in sing-song voice]
I'm not telling. [chuckles]

49:04.985 --> 49:07.335
[normal voice] Classic evil.
Lex would be so proud.

49:07.379 --> 49:09.033
This is really
about Lex Luthor?

49:09.076 --> 49:11.339
Don't you understand?
He was testing on you.

49:11.383 --> 49:14.647
We were colleagues.
We were scientists together.

49:14.690 --> 49:17.432
You were the guinea pig.
Your hair fell out.

49:17.476 --> 49:18.781
[gulps]

49:18.825 --> 49:22.089
Yeah. Just like his did.
Lex needed me.

49:22.133 --> 49:24.439
That's more than I can say
for your Superman.

49:24.483 --> 49:26.876
Superman needed me.
He... he needs me.

49:26.920 --> 49:28.313
Does he?

49:28.356 --> 49:30.228
Because I'm pretty sure
he's gonna get

49:30.271 --> 49:33.187
everything he needs
from his...

49:34.449 --> 49:36.016
fiancee.

[Krypto gasps]

49:39.193 --> 49:40.673
Oh, no.

49:40.716 --> 49:42.849
You didn't know
they were getting married.

49:42.892 --> 49:45.199
I really am sorry,
'cause this must be

49:45.243 --> 49:48.072
so painful to have to
hear this from me.

49:48.115 --> 49:49.638
No. You're lying.

49:49.682 --> 49:51.336
Am I? Huh.

49:51.379 --> 49:53.120
Well, then why
did this little bauble

49:53.164 --> 49:54.730
fall out of his Underoos

49:54.774 --> 49:56.558
the night I took him down?

49:56.602 --> 49:58.212
Look at it.

49:58.256 --> 50:00.432
The cut's fine but the clarity
is murky as heck. [gags]

50:00.475 --> 50:02.608
Face it, Wonder Mutt,
you're too late.

50:02.651 --> 50:05.785
Your boy's getting hitched.
And that means...

50:05.828 --> 50:07.221
Bye-bye, dog.

50:08.353 --> 50:10.137
But don't worry,

50:10.181 --> 50:12.052
if Superman doesn't have room
in his life for you anymore,

50:12.096 --> 50:15.664
I'm sure you can, uh, crash
at the Hall of Justice.

Wow!
She threw that dog real far.

50:31.463 --> 50:34.074
You know what's funny?
For a minute, I was worried

50:34.118 --> 50:37.164
when I saw that the orange
kryptonite gave you powers,

50:37.208 --> 50:40.472
but then I remembered,
uh, you're you. [laughing]

50:40.515 --> 50:43.040
Come on, let's go,
little piggies.

50:43.083 --> 50:45.346

Isn't this better
than Spanish class?

50:53.572 --> 50:55.530
Always nice to see ya.

50:55.574 --> 50:57.663
Talk, Lex.
I know you're behind this.

50:59.578 --> 51:03.103
Impressive destruction,
but not my work.

51:03.147 --> 51:05.192
Your name is literally
on the monster.

51:08.108 --> 51:11.938
Looks like
one of my little babies
is all grown up.

51:11.981 --> 51:13.679
That's creepy.

51:13.722 --> 51:16.160
Spill it, Lex.
What have you done
with Superman?

51:16.203 --> 51:19.554
Wherever Superman is,
it's got nothing
to do with me,

51:19.598 --> 51:22.601
or my company,
LexCorp International.

[Batman] Hey! Stop chewing
on that Batarang.

51:42.534 --> 51:44.927
Bruce Wayne paid a lot
of money for that,

51:44.971 --> 51:47.974
and then gave it to me
as a present.

51:48.017 --> 51:50.542
Vic, can you override
their defenses?

51:50.585 --> 51:52.326
[sighs] I can't do anything

51:52.370 --> 51:54.720
while they got me
stuck in airplane mode.

51:54.763 --> 51:57.114
All those protocols
for an alien invasion,

51:57.157 --> 51:58.898
nothing for little furballs.

51:58.941 --> 52:03.120
These quadrupedal land maniacs
have made a giant mistake

52:03.163 --> 52:05.470
messing with the King of...
Oh, whoa!

52:05.513 --> 52:07.428
Hey, hold on.
Is that fish food?

[chomping]

52:09.169 --> 52:11.302
Aw, someone was hungy.

52:11.345 --> 52:15.262
Lex Luthor denies involvement,
but is quote "team bad guy."

52:15.306 --> 52:18.309
Luckily, Superman's dog
is on our team.

52:18.352 --> 52:20.224
Krypto?

52:20.267 --> 52:24.097
Of course, Superman's dog
he makes out with.
He'll save us.

52:24.141 --> 52:25.316
[Superman] No.

52:25.359 --> 52:26.839
He doesn't have his powers.

52:29.494 --> 52:31.626
But those other animals do.

52:31.670 --> 52:34.847
And... and like, can't Krypto
work with them
to... to save Metropolis?

52:34.890 --> 52:36.457
Yeah, about that.

52:36.501 --> 52:39.678
He's not the greatest
with other animals.

52:39.721 --> 52:41.723
He better get it
together soon,

52:41.767 --> 52:44.683
or those ferrets
are gonna take over the world.

52:47.468 --> 52:48.687

he's still breathing.

52:58.914 --> 53:01.439
You bet on if I was alive?

53:01.482 --> 53:03.658
Nope. I bet on
if you were dead.

53:03.702 --> 53:05.573
I bet you were
horribly maimed.

53:07.967 --> 53:10.099
So, what, uh,
what is this place anyway?

53:10.143 --> 53:11.840
Is this some type
of fancy DMV?

53:11.884 --> 53:15.017
Are you kidding?
It's the Hall of Justice.

53:15.061 --> 53:18.020
This is where

1:13:11.604 --> 1:13:13.867
All because I was jealous
of Lois.

1:13:13.911 --> 1:13:16.000
Who wouldn't be?
Have you seen those bangs?

1:13:16.043 --> 1:13:18.045
Ba-bang!

1:13:18.089 --> 1:13:20.308
Superman was my only friend

1:13:20.352 --> 1:13:22.920
and I was afraid to lose that.

1:13:22.963 --> 1:13:24.748
But you can't blame yourself.

1:13:24.791 --> 1:13:26.880
I'm the only one to blame.

1:13:26.924 --> 1:13:28.447
If I really was his friend,

1:13:28.491 --> 1:13:30.144
I'd have been there for him
no matter what.

1:13:31.319 --> 1:13:32.495
My father was right.

1:13:33.844 --> 1:13:35.280
My problem is me.

1:13:40.894 --> 1:13:42.853
[sniffles] I'm sorry.

1:13:42.896 --> 1:13:44.855
Nah, man, you're good.

1:13:44.898 --> 1:13:47.423
You're just finally
being real with yourself.

1:13:47.466 --> 1:13:49.860
You can't have justice
without truth.

1:13:49.903 --> 1:13:51.035
Thanks, Ace.

1:13:51.949 --> 1:13:53.211
But it's too late.

1:13:55.082 --> 1:13:56.954
Are you sure
about that, perrito?

1:13:56.997 --> 1:13:58.477
-What do you mean?
-[dramatic music playing]

1:13:58.521 --> 1:13:59.609
You're flying.

1:13:59.652 --> 1:14:00.697
What?

1:14:00.740 --> 1:14:01.785
I'm...

1:14:01.828 --> 1:14:03.482
My powers.

1:14:03.526 --> 1:14:05.179
I'm back!

1:14:05.223 --> 1:14:07.399
The kryptonite
has left the dog.

1:14:07.443 --> 1:14:09.793
[sniffing] Well, that does
smell like sandalwood.

1:14:10.750 --> 1:14:12.317
[grunts]

1:14:17.714 --> 1:14:20.586
All right, time to save
the Justice League.

1:14:20.630 --> 1:14:23.023
-[Chip speaking Spanish]
-Let's crack some skulls.

1:14:25.243 --> 1:14:27.245
No, you've done enough.

1:14:27.288 --> 1:14:29.247
Um, say what now?

1:14:29.290 --> 1:14:32.119
I started this
with one best friend to save

1:14:32.163 --> 1:14:33.730
and now I have four more.

1:14:33.773 --> 1:14:35.775
Aw! He means us.

1:14:35.819 --> 1:14:39.257
I can't let you keep risking
your lives for my mistake.

1:14:39.300 --> 1:14:41.433
But don't worry,
when this is over,

1:14:41.477 --> 1:14:43.479
I'm still taking
you all to that farm.

1:14:44.305 --> 1:14:45.611
Pup, up and away!

1:14:48.396 --> 1:14:49.441
You believe that dog?

1:14:49.485 --> 1:14:50.921
Has an emotional breakthrough,

1:14:50.964 --> 1:14:53.489
gets his powers back,
and then bounces.

1:14:53.532 --> 1:14:55.795
-I thought it was sweet.
-Me, too.

1:14:55.839 --> 1:14:58.537
I'm medium on it, you know,
if I'm honest.

1:15:16.816 --> 1:15:19.210
Time for the death
of Superman.

1:15:19.253 --> 1:15:21.299
[Krypto] I'm not so sure
about that.

Ooh, it is fun.

1:16:18.051 --> 1:16:20.532
[chuckling] Hey.
You liked my little joke?

1:16:20.576 --> 1:16:22.969
Lockin' you up in the cell.
[laughs]

1:16:23.013 --> 1:16:25.537
That was funny, right? Right?

1:16:25.581 --> 1:16:28.105
No, hey, come on, it's me.
Papa Lex.

1:16:28.148 --> 1:16:29.802
No, hey... What? Come on!

1:16:30.760 --> 1:16:33.458
[laughing menacingly]

1:16:33.501 --> 1:16:35.591
Yeah, I don't get paid
enough for this, no.

1:16:35.634 --> 1:16:36.853
[elevator dings]

1:16:36.896 --> 1:16:38.202
Lock the gates.

[machine beeping]

1:16:43.033 --> 1:16:44.382
Ew, I can't wait that long.

1:16:44.425 --> 1:16:46.340
Let's do it now.
I want to do it now.

1:16:47.907 --> 1:16:49.387
[Mark] Are you sure about this?

1:16:49.430 --> 1:16:51.389
I mean, the kidnapping
we could get behind.

1:16:51.432 --> 1:16:54.522
We liked the kidnapping,
but if you do this,
they'll die.

1:16:54.566 --> 1:16:55.872
That's the point of...

1:16:55.915 --> 1:16:57.874
What did you think
we were doing?

1:16:57.917 --> 1:16:59.963
Mark, Keith, suffer.

1:17:00.659 --> 1:17:02.487

[dramatic music playing]

1:17:06.622 --> 1:17:08.275
Okay, Krypto, you are
definitely stalking me now.

1:17:08.319 --> 1:17:09.668
I'm, like, creeped out.

1:17:09.712 --> 1:17:11.496

You mean,
toward the murder rodent?

1:17:19.547 --> 1:17:20.723
Where is Superman?

1:17:20.766 --> 1:17:22.202
You're too late.

1:17:22.246 --> 1:17:23.726
I'm sending him back
to the place

1:17:23.769 --> 1:17:25.553
from whence he came from.

1:17:43.571 --> 1:17:45.051
[Lex] Uh, yeah, funny story.

1:17:45.095 --> 1:17:47.358
I, uh, turned my office
into a rocket ship.

1:17:47.401 --> 1:17:48.664
All billionaires have 'em.

1:17:58.891 --> 1:18:00.240
[Mark coughing]

1:18:00.284 --> 1:18:04.244
Krypto, there's a bomb
on the rocket.

1:18:04.288 --> 1:18:06.594
When it leaves
Earth's atmosphere,

1:18:07.944 --> 1:18:09.597
it'll implode.

1:18:09.641 --> 1:18:12.339
[Keith and Mark coughing]

1:18:15.821 --> 1:18:17.736
We're just coughing. Go!

1:18:17.780 --> 1:18:19.172
I'm coming for you, Superman.

1:18:20.739 --> 1:18:22.306
Uh-uh-uh!

[Lulu] Who gets to live, doggy?

1:18:28.921 --> 1:18:31.968
The man you love,
or the woman he does?

1:18:32.011 --> 1:18:33.970
You can't save them both
on your own.

1:18:35.449 --> 1:18:36.799
[distant boom]

1:18:41.978 --> 1:18:43.153
What's up, dog?

Ugh, what is this? PAW Patrol?

1:18:45.721 --> 1:18:48.941
[chuckles] I thought I told
you guys to stay put.

1:18:48.985 --> 1:18:50.943
When do we ever listen to you?

-From a rocket?
-I trust you.

1:19:04.391 --> 1:19:06.306
Okay, but from a rocket,
though?

1:19:09.353 --> 1:19:10.658
Hop on, y'all.

1:19:10.702 --> 1:19:12.486
Because this pig right here

1:19:12.530 --> 1:19:15.228

1:20:20.946 --> 1:20:23.122
Hamster?

1:20:23.166 --> 1:20:26.778
A hamster is just
a dollar store gerbil.

1:20:31.478 --> 1:20:33.002
A hamster is a chipmunk

something on my face?

No. How did they...?

1:22:33.644 --> 1:22:35.341
You forgot one thing, Lulu.

1:26:17.955 --> 1:26:19.478
What are you
talking about, man?

1:26:19.522 --> 1:26:20.827
And why was your syntax

1:26:20.871 --> 1:26:23.221
so oddly structured
in that sentence?

1:26:23.265 --> 1:26:25.441

Sorry, I'm not

Yeah, I'm not
really great with people.

1:32:16.966 --> 1:32:19.185
Probably because of my
traumatic puppyhood.

1:32:19.229 --> 1:32:21.840
As a child,
my family was taken from me.

Um, how long
is this gonna take?

1:34:07.424 --> 1:34:09.948
I got a hot date
with two firemen's helmets.

So, what's the mission?

1:34:38.716 --> 1:34:39.891
We can answer that.

1:34:41.980 --> 1:34:44.504
[Keith] Okay,
our intel indicates
a dog has been mutated.

1:34:44.548 --> 1:34:45.636
This could be dangerous.

We have to stop him.

Tighten your collars.
We've got work to do.

Hey, I know that dog.

1:34:57.213 --> 1:34:59.955
He's giant and blue
and about to crush us.

1:34:59.998 --> 1:35:01.957
Can't crush what we have.

1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:05.438
Say it back. Come on.
