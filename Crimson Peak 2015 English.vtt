Alan. When did you get back?
Two weeks ago.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.491
I thought Eunice
had told you.

04:35.560 --> 04:37.210
(STUTTERS) No,
I hadn't heard.

04:37.400 --> 04:40.609
Oh. She made a
conquest in London.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.091
(CHUCKLES) What are
you doing here?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.725
I'm setting up my
practice upstairs.

04:45.120 --> 04:46.804
I'm to meet
Ogilvie at 10:00

04:46.880 --> 04:48.600
to see if he wants to
publish my manuscript.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.290
You do know
it's only 9:00.

04:50.440 --> 04:52.329
I know, but I couldn't
wait any longer.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.284
And I want to make some
corrections anyway, so...

04:54.360 --> 04:56.169
If you have any free time,
please come and visit.

04:56.240 --> 04:57.969
We met him at
the British Museum

04:58.040 --> 05:00.361
last fall, when we
were visiting Alan.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.001
Mother. You wouldn't believe it.
He's so handsome.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.369
And he has crossed the ocean with
his sister, only to see Eunice again.

05:06.520 --> 05:08.284
Mother, he's here
on business.

05:08.520 --> 05:09.726
It seems he's a baronet.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.165
SOCIETY GIRL:
What's a baronet?

05:11.320 --> 05:12.845
Well, an aristocrat
of some sort.

05:13.040 --> 05:15.691
A man that feeds off land
that others work for him.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.522
A parasite with a title.

05:19.560 --> 05:23.929
This parasite is perfectly charming and
a magnificent dancer.

05:24.200 --> 05:26.123
Although, that wouldn't
concern you, would it, Edith,

05:26.280 --> 05:27.725
our very young
Jane Austen?

05:27.880 --> 05:29.291
Though, she died
a spinster, no?

05:29.440 --> 05:30.930
Mother, please.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.844
That's all right.
Actually, Mrs. McMichael,

05:32.920 --> 05:34.604
I would prefer to
be Mary Shelley.

05:35.240 --> 05:36.924
She died a widow.

Alan.

Ah, Miss Cushing.

it was a ghost story.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.649
Oh, it's not.

06:18.800 --> 06:21.485
It's more a story with a ghost in it.
Mmm-hmm...

06:21.640 --> 06:23.449
The ghost is
just a metaphor.

06:24.160 --> 06:25.321
A metaphor?

06:25.480 --> 06:27.482
For the past.
Well...

06:28.000 --> 06:30.367
Lovely handwriting.
Nice confident loops.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.726
Miss Cushing,

06:32.200 --> 06:34.680
may I offer a
word of advice?

06:35.360 --> 06:37.488
He told me it
needed a love story.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.445
Can you believe that?

06:40.360 --> 06:41.771
Ogilvie's
old-fashioned.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.883
He said that just
because I'm a woman.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.250
Everyone falls in love,
dear. Even women.

06:47.320 --> 06:49.322
I don't want to write
a love story like that.

06:50.040 --> 06:53.806
Well, my darling, I was hoping
to make this a celebratory gift.

06:55.080 --> 06:56.081

06:57.120 --> 06:59.088

it's the importance of
the right tool for the job.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.810
It's beautiful.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.442
But actually, Father,
I was hoping to type it,

07:05.640 --> 07:06.926
in your office.

07:07.040 --> 07:08.087
Type it?

07:08.240 --> 07:10.368
I'm submitting it to
<i>The Atlantic Monthly,</i>

07:10.560 --> 07:13.131
but I realize now that my
handwriting is too feminine.

07:13.360 --> 07:14.725

07:21.960 --> 07:23.371

must appreciate,</i>

Forgive the interruption.

I have an appointment with
Mr. Carter Everett Cushing.

07:48.320 --> 07:50.288
Goodness. With the
great man himself.

You're not late,
are you?

08:01.360 --> 08:02.486
He hates that.

08:02.680 --> 08:05.047
Uh, not at all. In fact,
I'm a little early.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.163
Oh, I'm afraid he
hates that, too.

08:07.240 --> 08:09.641
I'm sorry,
I don't mean to pry,

08:09.920 --> 08:11.843
but this is a piece
of fiction, is it not?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.889
Yes.
Who are you transcribing this for?

08:14.120 --> 08:16.964

to <i>The Atlantic Monthly.</i>

08:17.120 --> 08:18.121

08:19.920 --> 08:21.240
it's rather good,
don't you think?

08:22.040 --> 08:24.725
Really?
It's certainly captured my attention.

08:26.160 --> 08:27.924
I wrote it.

08:29.080 --> 08:30.081
It's mine.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.207
Well, the ghosts are
just a metaphor...

08:36.280 --> 08:37.884

fascinated me.

08:38.120 --> 08:39.246
You see,
where I come from

08:40.159 --> 08:42.082
ghosts are not to
be taken lightly.

Sir. It's my pleasure.

I see you've already
met my daughter, Edith.

08:52.880 --> 08:55.360
The Sharpe clay mines
have been royal purveyors

08:55.440 --> 08:59.240
of the purest scarlet
clay since 1796.

09:00.080 --> 09:01.889
In its liquid form,

09:01.960 --> 09:04.531
it is so rich in ore
and so malleable

09:04.680 --> 09:07.286
that it can produce
the strongest bricks and tiles.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.569
Excessive mining
in the last 20 years

09:09.640 --> 09:12.166
has caused most of our
old deposits to collapse.

09:12.360 --> 09:14.840
This is a clay harvester
of my own design.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.764

the clay upwards

09:16.920 --> 09:18.365
as it digs deep.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.763
I have absolutely
no doubt

09:23.840 --> 09:27.049
this machine will revolutionize clay
mining as we know it.

09:27.600 --> 09:29.170
Turn it off, please.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.842
Have you tested it?
Full-scale?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.286
Not yet, sir.
We're very close.

09:37.360 --> 09:38.486
But we hope that,
with funding...

09:38.560 --> 09:43.327
So, actually, what you have is a toy,
and some fancy words.

09:44.240 --> 09:45.321
Mr. Cushing, I...

09:45.520 --> 09:48.251
You've already tried,
and failed,

09:48.440 --> 09:50.522
to raise capital
in London,

09:50.600 --> 09:51.681
Edinburgh,

09:52.000 --> 09:53.809

Yes, that's correct, sir.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.691
And now you're here.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.369
Correct again, sir.

09:59.520 --> 10:00.885
The men at this table,

10:01.240 --> 10:02.685
all of us,

10:02.840 --> 10:05.684
came up through
honest, hard work.

10:06.200 --> 10:09.090
Well, maybe not all of us.
Mr. Ferguson, here, is a lawyer.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.443
But even he
can't help that.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.682
I started as
a steel worker

10:13.880 --> 10:16.531
raising buildings before
I could own them.

10:16.720 --> 10:18.085
My hands.

10:18.240 --> 10:19.730
Feel them.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.370
Rough.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.126
The reflection
of who I am.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.250
Now, you, sir,

10:26.720 --> 10:28.802
when I shook your hand...

10:30.120 --> 10:32.771
You've got the softest
hands I've ever felt.

10:34.920 --> 10:38.561
In America, we bank on effort,
not privilege.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.729
That is how we
built this country.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.086
I'm here with all
that I possess, sir.

10:45.240 --> 10:47.686
A name,
a patch of land

10:47.840 --> 10:49.444
and the will to
make it yield.

10:49.600 --> 10:50.931
The least that you
can grant me

10:51.000 --> 10:52.604
is the courtesy
of your time

10:52.760 --> 10:55.206
and the chance to prove to you
and these fine gentlemen

10:55.360 --> 10:56.930
that my will, dear sir,

10:57.080 --> 11:00.050
is, at the very least,
as strong as yours.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.491

and come along tonight.

Mrs. McMichael has
gone to a lot of trouble.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.447
Little Lord Fauntleroy
will be there.

11:24.680 --> 11:26.444
You mean Thomas Sharpe?

11:26.600 --> 11:29.126
Sir Thomas Sharpe,
Baronet.

11:29.280 --> 11:32.443
Apparently, he's taken
an interest in young Eunice.

11:32.600 --> 11:35.285
I saw you spying
on us, child.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.808
Was his proposal
so outrageous

11:37.960 --> 11:40.201
as to merit such a
harsh answer from you?

11:40.360 --> 11:42.044
It wasn't his
proposal, my love.

11:42.200 --> 11:43.531
It was him.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.965
There's something about
him that I don't like.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.805
What, I don't know.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.521
And I don't like
not knowing.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.440
What I saw was
a dreamer facing defeat.

11:56.520 --> 11:57.931
(SIGHS)

11:58.000 --> 11:59.490
Did you see his suit?

11:59.640 --> 12:02.644
It was beautifully tailored,
but at least a decade old.

12:02.720 --> 12:03.721
(SIGHS)

12:04.560 --> 12:07.211
I can see that you observed
far more than I did.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.807
And his shoes were
handmade, but worn.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.200
That'll be young
Dr. McMichael.

12:11.360 --> 12:13.567
He's brought his new
motorcar to collect me.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.802
Come and see it.
Say hello to him.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.002
He's just opened
his new practice.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.322
And he's always been
awfully fond of you.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.370
I know that, Father.

12:23.200 --> 12:24.247
ALAN: Good evening, Marie.

12:24.400 --> 12:25.765

My, don't we look
smart, Alan.

12:32.840 --> 12:35.525
Oh, it's just something
I threw together.

the belle of the ball this evening.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.205
Don't you agree, Alan?

12:40.680 --> 12:43.524
As I recall, Edith takes a dim view
of social frivolity.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.082
You lads enjoy
the party.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.770
Don't let him
drink too much.

12:47.840 --> 12:48.921
Hey.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.204
So, she's not coming?

12:53.360 --> 12:55.089
Stubborn to the bone.

12:55.840 --> 12:57.365
Where does she
get that from?

12:57.520 --> 12:59.249
CARTER: I'm not complaining.

12:59.400 --> 13:00.890

13:24.560 --> 13:27.040
Father, did you
forget something?

14:46.800 --> 14:48.484
(WHISPERS)
What is it?

14:48.640 --> 14:50.324
What do you want?

14:58.480 --> 15:01.165
Beware of Crimson Peak.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.162
Excuse me, miss.
Are you all right, miss?

15:13.160 --> 15:15.481
Whatever is it?
Please, help me up.

15:17.320 --> 15:19.607
There's a Sir Thomas
Sharpe at the door.

15:19.680 --> 15:20.806
Thomas Sharpe?

15:20.880 --> 15:22.880
He's dripping wet,
and most insistent on coming in.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.843
Well, that's absolutely
out of the question, Annie.

15:24.960 --> 15:26.200
Please just tell
him to go away.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.845
I tried.
And?

15:27.920 --> 15:29.604
He wants to
talk to you.

15:35.120 --> 15:36.167
Miss Cushing.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.124
Are you all right?
You seem a little pale.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.010
I'm not all too well,
Sir Thomas, I'm afraid.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.204
Father isn't home.
Oh, I know.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.487
I waited in the rain
for him to leave.

15:47.560 --> 15:48.800
Oh.

15:49.560 --> 15:52.530
I know he's going to the reception at
the McMichael house,

15:52.720 --> 15:54.210
which is my
destination, too.

15:54.360 --> 15:56.442
But that's in
Bidwell Parkway, sir.

15:56.640 --> 15:58.927
This is Masten Park.

15:59.080 --> 16:00.650
You're very, very lost.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.166
That I am.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.890
And I desperately
need your help.

16:04.440 --> 16:05.566
My help with what?

16:06.040 --> 16:07.690
Miss Cushing, the language,
for one thing.

16:07.840 --> 16:10.969
As you can plainly see,
I do not speak a word of American.

16:12.840 --> 16:15.207
Tell me, why would you
want to stay here?

16:15.880 --> 16:17.564
All alone.

16:21.280 --> 16:22.770
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

17:30.360 --> 17:32.408
Alan, this is
Sir Thomas Sharpe.

17:32.560 --> 17:34.528
Sir Thomas,
Dr. Alan McMichael.

17:34.680 --> 17:36.444
Best man in town if
you're feeling poorly.

17:36.600 --> 17:39.331
I've heard so much about you
from Mother and my sister.

17:39.480 --> 17:43.280
Although, I must confess,
I had a little trouble understanding your title.

17:43.800 --> 17:44.847
"Baronet."

17:44.920 --> 17:46.410
Edith kindly
explained it to me.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.120
Edith,

17:48.280 --> 17:49.884
this is Lady Lucille Sharpe.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.007
My sister.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.640
I'm delighted to
meet you, Miss Cushing.

17:53.520 --> 17:55.761
You've managed to delay
my brother quite a bit.

17:56.520 --> 17:57.851
(WHISPERS)
Now's the time.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.128
Poor Eunice was
growing desperate.

18:00.280 --> 18:03.921
She claims no gentleman in America knows
how to dance a proper waltz.

18:04.680 --> 18:05.806
Come with me.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.644
Interesting development,
don't you think?

18:07.800 --> 18:08.801
Indeed.

18:08.960 --> 18:10.007
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:10.160 --> 18:12.003
please make some space.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.721
The baronet would like to
demonstrate for us the waltz.

18:15.880 --> 18:17.530
European style.
(APPLAUSE)

18:18.120 --> 18:19.770
Mrs. McMichael,
I wanted to apologize.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.490
Edith, we weren't
expecting you.

18:21.640 --> 18:23.608
I know. And I'm sure
there's no place for me...

18:23.760 --> 18:24.966
Don't worry,
my child.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.128
Everybody has their place.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.725
I'll make sure
you find yours.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.681
The waltz.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.125
Not a complicated
dance, really.

18:33.280 --> 18:36.080
The lady takes her place slightly to
the left of the leading gentleman.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.930
Six basic steps,
and that's all.

18:39.080 --> 18:41.890
However, it is said that
the true test of the perfect waltz

18:42.040 --> 18:43.610
is for it to
be so swift,

18:43.760 --> 18:45.171
so delicate

18:45.240 --> 18:47.288
and so smooth

18:47.560 --> 18:51.406
that a candle flame will not be extinguished
in the hand of the lead dancer.

18:51.560 --> 18:55.770
Now, that requires
the perfect partner.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.610
Would you be mine?

19:02.880 --> 19:04.962
I don't think so.
Thank you.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.324
But I'm sure Eunice
would be delighted.

19:07.480 --> 19:08.527
I dare say.

19:08.600 --> 19:09.647
But I have asked you.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.401
(CROWD COOS)

19:31.040 --> 19:32.804

19:37.720 --> 19:39.688
(WHISPERS) Why are
we doing this?

19:39.760 --> 19:42.923
I've always closed my eyes to things
that made me uncomfortable.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.640
It makes
everything easier.

19:45.800 --> 19:47.564
I don't want to
close my eyes.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.048
I want to keep
them open.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.689
(PIANO STOPS)
(APPLAUSE)

21:20.040 --> 21:21.201
Mr. Holly!

21:21.360 --> 21:22.361
Mr. Cushing.

21:22.920 --> 21:25.366
I like the club the first
thing in the morning.

21:25.760 --> 21:26.921
I have it all
to myself.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.729
A great way to
start the day, sir.

21:31.760 --> 21:34.240
There's a young gentleman
and his sister.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.288
I want you to
investigate for me.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.771
There's something not
quite right about them.

21:38.040 --> 21:39.280
I want results.

21:39.800 --> 21:41.165
As soon as possible.

21:44.320 --> 21:47.608
ALAN: You have not been using
the drops regularly...

21:48.040 --> 21:49.530
Edith, come in.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.081
...and I must insist
you do so.

21:52.240 --> 21:56.086
Take this to the druggist
and ask him to prepare it exactly.

21:58.560 --> 22:00.085
And resume the dose.

22:00.240 --> 22:03.369
<i>"Toxicology of the Eye."
"Morphology of the Optic Nerve."</i>

22:03.520 --> 22:06.091
<i>"Principles of Optical
Refraction."</i>

22:07.240 --> 22:09.641
And "Arthur Conan Doyle."

22:09.800 --> 22:11.962
Fancy yourself
a detective?

22:12.120 --> 22:14.282
Well, not really,

22:14.440 --> 22:16.807
but he is an ophthalmologist
just like me.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.086
(CHUCKLES)

22:19.000 --> 22:20.126
Come.

22:20.240 --> 22:22.320
I think you're going to like
what I have to show you.

22:22.760 --> 22:24.922
Ghost photography
is easy to fake.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.321
However, with
glass plates

22:27.400 --> 22:29.926
it is, by definition,
impossible.

22:30.080 --> 22:32.128
I got these in London.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.611
They're genuine.

22:33.760 --> 22:37.401
The image is captured using
a coating of silver salts,

22:37.560 --> 22:39.767
invisible to the naked eye.

22:39.960 --> 22:42.770
It's called
a latent image.

22:42.960 --> 22:45.008
Now, it's my belief
that houses,

22:45.160 --> 22:48.846
places, be it by chemical
compounds in the earth

22:49.000 --> 22:51.731
or the minerals in the stone
can retain impressions

22:52.080 --> 22:54.606
or a person that is
no longer living.

22:56.960 --> 22:58.325
But not everyone
can see them.

22:58.520 --> 22:59.885
The man that just left,

22:59.960 --> 23:02.122
amongst other ailments,
is color blind.

23:02.480 --> 23:06.326
Now, that man will never
perceive the colors red or green.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.848
He only accepts their existence because
the majority around him does.

23:12.160 --> 23:13.685
Perhaps we only
notice things

23:13.760 --> 23:16.969
when the time comes
for us to see them.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.486
(CHUCKLES)

23:22.200 --> 23:24.680
You've never spoken to me
about these interests of yours, Alan.

23:24.840 --> 23:26.683
You've never given
me the chance.

23:28.480 --> 23:32.451
Edith, I understand your
fascination with the Sharpes,

23:32.640 --> 23:34.608
but in your own
best interest,

23:34.680 --> 23:37.524
proceed with caution
is all I ask.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.331
You've been gone
a long time and, well,

23:40.520 --> 23:42.648
I've managed somewhat.

23:46.040 --> 23:47.371
THOMAS: (CHUCKLES)
No, Edith.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.569
I think every time I read it,
it gets better and better.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.688
And I don't mind
the love story at all.

23:52.840 --> 23:53.887
Just a chapter or two.

23:54.040 --> 23:55.485
Well, I like it.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.166
Let me know
what you think.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.049
I'll finish it now.

24:09.000 --> 24:10.525
Is it a butterfly?

24:11.160 --> 24:12.286
No.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.244
But it will be soon.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.164
Oh, I hadn't
seen them.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.004
They're dying.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.245
They take their heat
from the sun

24:23.440 --> 24:25.681
and when it deserts them,
they die.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.531
That's sad.

24:28.680 --> 24:31.160
No, it's not sad,
Edith. It's nature.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.368
It's a savage world
of things dying

24:35.520 --> 24:38.091
or eating each other,
right beneath our feet.

24:38.240 --> 24:40.561
Surely there's
more to it than that.

24:42.040 --> 24:43.849
Beautiful things
are fragile.

24:47.760 --> 24:51.401
At home, we have
only black moths.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.842
Formidable creatures,
to be sure,

24:53.920 --> 24:55.524
but they lack beauty.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.200
They thrive on the
dark and the cold.

24:58.960 --> 25:00.724
What do they
feed on?

25:01.240 --> 25:02.969
Butterflies,
I'm afraid.

25:17.920 --> 25:19.729
Are you sure
about this?

25:21.600 --> 25:23.728
I don't think she's the right choice.
She's too young.

25:23.880 --> 25:25.405
She's just
a child, Thomas.

25:25.560 --> 25:27.483
Lucille, I've
explained all this.

25:28.720 --> 25:30.165
I will need the ring.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.090
The ring's mine.

25:32.240 --> 25:33.810
I earned it.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.809
I will want it back.

25:37.480 --> 25:39.767
Then you'd better
hope I'm successful.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.961
This is the last thing
we have to sell.

25:44.120 --> 25:45.929
You're not selling it.

25:46.800 --> 25:51.362
We are buying
something with it.

25:57.240 --> 25:59.641
Mr. Holly.
Is something the matter?

25:59.800 --> 26:00.961
Mr. Cushing.

26:01.160 --> 26:03.731
It is not often that I am
the bearer of bad news,

26:03.880 --> 26:08.124
but when I am,
I insist upon delivering it myself.

26:10.920 --> 26:12.684
Don't open it here.

26:17.200 --> 26:18.690
(WHISPERS)
Now is the time.

26:21.240 --> 26:23.925
Edith, may I
have a word?

26:24.280 --> 26:26.760
Just one moment.
Let me get my father.

26:33.360 --> 26:34.361
(KNOCKING)

26:34.480 --> 26:37.051
Father.
Everybody's waiting.

26:37.720 --> 26:38.960
I'll be there shortly.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.128
Miss Cushing.

26:44.280 --> 26:46.521
Edith. I really have no
right to ask this, but...

26:46.600 --> 26:47.601
Sir Thomas.

26:48.560 --> 26:50.642
May I speak with you
in my study, please?

26:50.800 --> 26:54.168
You and your sister,
if you would be so kind as to fetch her.

26:55.440 --> 26:58.284
Child, please tell our guests that
we will join them presently.

26:58.920 --> 27:00.763
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

27:03.240 --> 27:05.049
Now, Lady Lucille.

27:05.760 --> 27:08.730
Sir Thomas,
the first time we met

27:09.040 --> 27:12.726
I imagine it was hard for
you to realize that I didn't like you.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.405
You made that
clear enough, sir.

27:14.560 --> 27:15.721
But I had hoped that
now, with time...

27:15.880 --> 27:18.326
Your time, Sir Thomas,
is up.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.482
LUCILLE: Could you speak
plainly, Mr. Cushing?

27:20.760 --> 27:22.444
Plain I will be, missy.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.284
Plainer than you
might like to hear.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.480
In the past few days

27:26.640 --> 27:28.404
your brother has
deemed it fine enough

27:28.560 --> 27:30.324
to mix business with pleasure

27:30.480 --> 27:33.006
by repeatedly engaging
socially with my daughter.

27:33.640 --> 27:35.324
My only daughter.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.164
Sir, I'm aware that I have
no position to offer,

27:37.240 --> 27:38.765
but the fact is...

27:38.920 --> 27:40.763
You are falling
in love with her.

27:40.920 --> 27:42.604
Is that it?

27:43.840 --> 27:45.729
You play the part well.

27:45.960 --> 27:50.409
The other day, my daughter asked me
why I didn't like you.

27:50.680 --> 27:53.331
Honestly, at the time,
I had no good answer.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.487
But now, I do.

27:54.920 --> 27:58.367
That document there
gave me my answer.

28:01.520 --> 28:04.444
That's the first honest
reaction I've seen from you.

28:06.280 --> 28:07.441
Does she know?

28:07.720 --> 28:08.767
No.

28:10.280 --> 28:11.964
But I will tell her,

28:12.120 --> 28:14.646
if that's what it takes
to send you on your way.

28:15.280 --> 28:17.123
Sir, I know you will
find this hard to believe...

28:17.200 --> 28:18.406
You love her.

28:18.640 --> 28:19.641
I know.

28:19.760 --> 28:20.807
You're repeating yourself.

28:21.520 --> 28:22.601
Now, you,

28:22.800 --> 28:24.802
you seem to be the more
collected one, dear.

28:25.160 --> 28:27.003
It's overly
generous, I know.

28:27.160 --> 28:29.640
But if you want that check to clear,
there are two conditions.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.600
There's a train for New York City leaving
first thing tomorrow morning.

28:32.640 --> 28:35.530
You and your brother
better be on it.

28:36.080 --> 28:37.491
Do we understand
each other?

28:37.560 --> 28:38.721
We do.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.485
What is the second
condition?

28:40.560 --> 28:42.244
That concerns my daughter.

28:42.400 --> 28:44.209
Tonight you must

28:45.480 --> 28:47.687
thoroughly break
her heart.

28:53.360 --> 28:54.930

28:55.000 --> 28:57.685
we have an unexpected
announcement.

28:58.320 --> 28:59.685
Sir Thomas.

29:04.000 --> 29:05.400
(WHISPERING)
Thank you, Mr. Cushing.

29:08.520 --> 29:10.170
Ladies and gentlemen,

29:10.840 --> 29:13.844
when I first came to
America, my heart was

29:14.000 --> 29:16.162
brimming with a
sense of adventure.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.531
Here, the future actually
seemed to mean something.

29:21.320 --> 29:23.800
I have found warmth and
friendship among you all.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.891
But for now,

29:26.160 --> 29:27.366
farewell.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.684
May we meet again.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.042
Perhaps on
a different shore.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.201
My sister and I
depart for England

29:37.720 --> 29:39.324
just in time
for the winter.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.247
To lasting friendship.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.322
ALL: To lasting friendship.

29:45.480 --> 29:47.721
(SOFTLY)
Excuse me. Sorry.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.091
Edith.

29:53.880 --> 29:55.564
You're leaving us.

29:55.720 --> 29:58.080
We must return home immediately
and attend to our interests.

29:58.440 --> 30:00.568
And with nothing to
hold us in America...

30:00.720 --> 30:01.721
I see.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.844
Your novel.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.367
I read the new chapters.
I'll have them delivered in the morning.

30:06.520 --> 30:07.521
That's very good of you,
thank you.

30:07.600 --> 30:08.840
Would you still like
to know my thoughts?

30:09.000 --> 30:10.411
If we must.

30:13.200 --> 30:15.726
It's absurdly sentimental.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.611
The aches that you describe
with such earnestness.

30:18.760 --> 30:20.250
The pain, the loss.

30:20.400 --> 30:21.680
You clearly haven't
lived at all.

30:21.720 --> 30:23.449
In fact, you only seem to know
what other writers tell you.

30:23.520 --> 30:24.567
That's enough!

30:24.640 --> 30:26.244
You insist on describing
the torments of love

30:26.320 --> 30:27.924

nothing about them.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.766
What do you dream of?

30:30.920 --> 30:32.604
A kind man?

30:32.760 --> 30:34.967
A pure soul
to be redeemed?

30:35.120 --> 30:36.770
A wounded bird
you can nourish?

30:37.280 --> 30:38.611
Perfection.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.811
Perfection has no
place in love, Edith.

30:41.960 --> 30:44.247
I advise you to return
to your ghosts and fancies.

30:44.360 --> 30:45.486
The sooner, the better.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.767
You know precious little
of the human heart, or love,

30:48.240 --> 30:49.924
or the pain that
comes with it.

30:50.080 --> 30:51.764

a spoiled child!

this morning by Sir Thomas Sharpe,

he was talking about.

about him.

40:14.680 --> 40:15.966
He has a collar.

40:16.120 --> 40:17.406
Is he a stray,
you think?

40:17.480 --> 40:18.686
That's impossible.

There's no other house for miles and
the town's half a day's walk away.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.207
His blood

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:01.001
will be on your hands.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.889
THOMAS: Edith!
Thomas!

01:06:03.040 --> 01:06:04.326
Thomas, come quick!

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:07.126
A woman in the corridor, there!
Edith, what's the matter?

01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:08.486
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:11.490
EDITH: <i>There was such
hatred in her eyes.</i>

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.083
And intelligence.

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.521
She knows who I am and
she wants me to leave.

01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:18.330
Nonsense, my dear.

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:20.244
You're not
going anywhere.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.204
You had a bad dream.
You were sleepwalking.

01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:26.170
No! I'm afraid I shall
go mad if I stay.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.527
My darling, you're
imagining things.

01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.561
Tomorrow, why
don't we go out,

01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.320
to the post office.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:35.960
I think some fresh air
will do you good.

01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:39.081
No. I have to leave.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:40.400
I have to get
away from here.

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:43.330
Edith, this is
your home now.

01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:46.722
You have nowhere
else to go.

01:06:53.720 --> 01:06:54.881
What is she doing?

01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.122
How could she know
about Mother?

01:06:57.280 --> 01:06:58.960
I have no idea.
I haven't told her a thing.

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.400
What's she
trying to do?

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:03.166
I don't know.
She's in quite a state.

01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:05.569
Tomorrow

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:09.408
I'll go to the depot, pick up the
machine parts and take her with me.

01:07:09.560 --> 01:07:11.130
Let her get
some fresh air.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.607
Yes. Get her
out of here.

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:17.324
Once she signs
the final papers,

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.084
I want this over with.

01:07:29.680 --> 01:07:33.162
This is a valve controller
I had fabricated in Glasgow.

01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:35.362
This could make
all the difference.

01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:37.010
Think lucky
thoughts, Edith.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:40.050
The Sharpe mines might reopen
if this thing cooperates.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:41.161
Mr. Sharpe?

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:44.081
THOMAS: Ah, excellent.
Thank you.

01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:45.650
You're Lady Sharpe,
then?

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:48.804
Forgive me, mum,
but there's a few letters for you.

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:53.165
Two of them are certified
letters from your solicitor.

01:07:54.360 --> 01:07:58.729
And another one comes all
the way from Milan, Italy.

01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.564
I don't know
anyone in Italy.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:03.650
Respectfully, your Ladyship,
it's apparent that you do.

01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:07.566
THOMAS: Edith.

01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.562
The storm's picking up.
We ought to leave soon.

01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.006
Otherwise we won't make
it back to the house.

01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:13.570
If you need to stay
the night, Sir Thomas,

01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.165
we've a small
room downstairs.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.450
Why not?

01:08:20.880 --> 01:08:22.723
ALAN: And you're sure this is
their forwarding address?

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.531
Thomas and Lucille Sharpe,
yes, in Cumberland, England, sir.

01:08:25.720 --> 01:08:26.845
Thank you.

01:08:28.560 --> 01:08:30.243
HOLLY: Dr. McMichael.

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.604
Mr. Holly.
At your service, sir.

01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.371
Did you bring the copy
of the information?

01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.800
It took some time to obtain
that newspaper clipping.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.040
It's damn gruesome,
if you ask me.

01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:52.484
It's a shame.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.487
The only relevant information I could pass
to Mr. Cushing were the civil documents.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.721
But it was enough to impede
any further relationship

01:08:59.800 --> 01:09:02.246
between Sir Thomas
and Miss Cushing.

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.484
Prevent them
from marrying.

01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.166
Why was that?

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.246
Because, you see,

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.527
Sir Thomas is
already married.

01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:20.288
This fellow, Cavendish,
your hero.

01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:22.841
There's a darkness
to him. I like him.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:25.399
Does he make it
all the way through?

01:09:25.479 --> 01:09:26.481
It's entirely
up to him.

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:29.607
What do you mean?
Characters talk to you.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.081
They transform.
They make choices.

01:09:33.240 --> 01:09:34.604
Choices.

01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.488
As to who
they become.

01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.131
Well, (CHUCKLES) this is rather dismal,
I'm sorry to say.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:46.606
But at least it's warm.

01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.171
Oh, I like it
much better.

01:09:48.319 --> 01:09:50.129
Better than what?

01:09:50.479 --> 01:09:52.801
Better than the house.
(CHUCKLES)

01:09:53.279 --> 01:09:55.282
Why don't we leave?

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:58.205
The house is
all we have.

01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:01.681
I left everything
I was behind.

01:10:02.040 --> 01:10:03.121
Everything I had.

01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:06.122
We could live anywhere you want.
Anywhere?

London?

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:09.802

Paris is beautiful.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.006

01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.130
Have you ever
been to Italy?

01:10:20.840 --> 01:10:22.683
Yes, I have once.

01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:30.407
The past, Thomas.

01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:32.000
You're always looking
to the past.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.642
You won't find me there.

01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.087

01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.331

we're back.

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.091
I was making breakfast.

01:12:33.280 --> 01:12:35.282
It was burning.
I moved it.

01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.804

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:45.602

We got snowed in.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.204

home last night.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:49.691

He's my husband.

had an accident.

I can't be alone.

01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:02.730
You have nothing
to live for now.

01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:03.961
Sign.

01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:07.487
All the women we found...

01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:10.530
London, Edinburgh,
Milan.

01:37:11.520 --> 01:37:12.521
America.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.531
Yes, America.

01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:16.768
All had what
was necessary.

01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:21.723
Money, broken dreams
and no living relatives.

01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.564
No one ever
looked for them.

01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:26.407
Mercy killings, really.

01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.288
Is that what
I'm going to be?

01:37:29.960 --> 01:37:33.089
What about the Italian
woman? Enola?

01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.922
You killed her baby.

01:37:36.960 --> 01:37:38.883
I did not.

01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.642
None of them ever
fucked Thomas.

01:37:42.800 --> 01:37:44.450
Don't you understand?

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.285
It was mine.

01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:52.770
It was born wrong.

01:37:55.320 --> 01:37:57.402
We should have
let it die at birth,

01:37:59.960 --> 01:38:01.121
but I wanted it.

01:38:01.280 --> 01:38:03.089
She told me
she could save it.

01:38:04.840 --> 01:38:06.444
She was determined.

01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:10.001
She lied.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.650
EDITH: All this horror,

01:38:12.120 --> 01:38:13.963
for what? The money?

01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.206
To keep the mansion?

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.169
The Sharpe name?
The mines?

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:20.360
The marriages were
for money, of course.

01:38:22.040 --> 01:38:23.451
But the horror,

01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:25.808
the horror was for love.

01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.766
The things we do for
a love like this are ugly,

01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.211
mad,

01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:35.208
full of sweat
and regret.

01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:40.011
This love burns you
and maims you

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:44.286
and twists you
inside out.

01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:47.967
It is a monstrous love

01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:52.204
and it makes
monsters of us all.

01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:54.763
But you should
have seen him,

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.684
as a child, Thomas.

01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:02.205
He was perfect.

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.680
So, from all his
small infractions,

01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:11.246
from my mother's cane,
I protected him.

01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.207
I took so
many beatings.

01:39:15.880 --> 01:39:17.848
And when she
found out about us,

01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:20.725
well...

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:29.406
The only love Thomas and
I ever knew was from one another.

01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:32.648
In these rotting walls.

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.366
Hiding.

01:39:36.320 --> 01:39:39.244
That's not true.
You suffocate him.

01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:41.645
Sign your name!

01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:44.362
Sign your bloody name!

01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.006
My father,
who killed him?

01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:04.248
Such a coarse,
condescending man.

01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.045
He loved you.

01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:10.248
You should have
seen his sad face

01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:13.445
when I smashed it
on the sink.

01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:23.887

01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:45.971
Don't come near me!
Listen to me. Please.

01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:48.247
You get away!
Edith, please. Listen.

01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:50.080
McMichael is still alive.
He's still alive.

01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:51.565
You lied to me!
I did.

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:52.721
You poisoned me!
I did.

01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:54.040
You told me
you loved me!

01:40:54.120 --> 01:40:55.406
I do.

01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:59.645
Edith, please.
Please trust me one more time.

01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:03.766
You can leave if you want,
or you can wait here for me.

01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:06.491
I'm going to get
those papers back.

01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:08.404
I'm going to
finish this.

01:41:20.440 --> 01:41:22.090

01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:32.605
Yes, she will live.
You're not to touch her.

01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.444
You're ordering me?

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.523
We can leave, Lucille.
Leave Allerdale Hall.

01:41:36.680 --> 01:41:37.681
Leave?

01:41:37.760 --> 01:41:39.489
Think about it.
We can start a new life.

01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.001
Where?

01:41:41.080 --> 01:41:43.367
Anywhere. It doesn't matter.
We can leave it behind.

01:41:43.480 --> 01:41:44.925
We let the Sharpe name
die with the mines.

01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:46.604
We let this edifice
sink in the ground.

01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:48.444
All these years holding
these walls together.

01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:50.363
We would be free.

01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:53.046
Free, Lucille.

01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:56.203

We've been dead for years, Lucille.

more than me?

we've become!

01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.600
You promised you would not
fall in love with anyone else.

01:42:17.640 --> 01:42:19.404
