<i>Bum buttery, flit fluttery</i>
<i>Dum diddly-ooh</i>

01:11.704 --> 01:15.037
<i>Bum buttery, bluebird</i>
<i>Is singing a tune</i>

01:15.241 --> 01:18.574
<i>Daffy-down-dillies awaken</i>
<i>And prune</i>

01:18.778 --> 01:21.679
<i>Bursting in bloom</i>
<i>All the flowers assume</i>

01:21.881 --> 01:25.942
<i>It's a loverly, loverly spring</i>

01:33.126 --> 01:36.687
<i>Chit-chattery chipmunks</i>
<i>All singing along</i>

01:36.930 --> 01:40.024
<i>Humming their</i>
<i>Join-in-a-spring-along song</i>

01:40.233 --> 01:43.031
<i>Spring is the springiest time</i>
<i>For a song</i>

01:43.236 --> 01:46.535
<i>It's a loverly, loverly spring</i>

01:46.773 --> 01:50.903
<i>In the forest we play</i>
<i>With the rabbits all day</i>--

01:51.177 --> 01:55.170
<i>I'm sorry to say that this is not</i>
<i>the movie you will be watching.</i>

01:55.615 --> 02:00.052
<i>The movie you are about to see</i>
<i>is extremely unpleasant.</i>

02:00.286 --> 02:02.811
<i>If you wish to see a film</i>
<i>about a happy little elf,</i>

02:03.056 --> 02:06.321
<i>I'm sure there is still plenty</i>
<i>of seating in theater number two.</i>

02:06.526 --> 02:09.187
<i>However, if you like stories</i>
<i>about clever</i>

02:09.395 --> 02:11.590
<i>and reasonably attractive orphans,</i>

02:11.865 --> 02:15.323
<i>suspicious fires,</i>
<i>carnivorous leeches,</i>

02:15.535 --> 02:18.527
<i>Italian food</i>
<i>and secret organizations,</i>

02:18.771 --> 02:20.261
<i>then stay</i>

02:20.540 --> 02:22.667
<i>as I retrace each and every one</i>

02:22.876 --> 02:25.845
<i>of the Baudelaire children's</i>
<i>woeful steps.</i>

02:26.779 --> 02:29.509
<i>My name is Lemony Snicket,</i>

02:29.716 --> 02:32.913
<i>and it is my sad duty</i>
<i>to document this tale.</i>

02:34.387 --> 02:36.184
<i>Violet Baudelaire, the eldest,</i>

02:36.389 --> 02:40.416
<i>was one of the finest 14-year-old</i>
<i>inventors in the world.</i>

02:40.727 --> 02:43.628
<i>Anyone who knew Violet well could</i>
<i>tell she was inventing something</i>

02:43.897 --> 02:46.866
<i>when her long hair was tied up</i>
<i>in a ribbon.</i>

02:47.734 --> 02:51.534
<i>In a world of abandoned items</i>
<i>and discarded materials,</i>

02:51.771 --> 02:54.763
<i>Violet knew there</i>
<i>was always something.</i>

02:55.175 --> 02:57.336
<i>Something she could fashion</i>
<i>into nearly any device</i>

02:57.544 --> 02:59.910
<i>for nearly every occasion.</i>

03:00.580 --> 03:03.913
<i>And no one was better</i>
<i>to test her inventions</i>

03:04.717 --> 03:05.877
<i>than her brother.</i>

03:07.420 --> 03:12.119
<i>Klaus Baudelaire, the middle child,</i>
<i>loved books.</i>

03:12.358 --> 03:15.020
<i>Or, rather, the things he learned</i>
<i>from books.</i>

03:15.328 --> 03:18.786
<i>The Baudelaire parents had</i>
<i>an enormous library in their mansion.</i>

03:19.098 --> 03:23.467
<i>A room filled with thousands</i>
<i>of books on nearly every subject.</i>

03:23.770 --> 03:25.499
<i>And nothing pleased Klaus more</i>

03:25.772 --> 03:30.471
<i>than spending an afternoon filling up</i>
<i>his head with their contents.</i>

03:30.777 --> 03:33.371
<i>And everything he read</i>
<i>he remembered.</i>

03:40.787 --> 03:45.053
<i>Sunny, the youngest,</i>
<i>had a different interest.</i>

03:45.258 --> 03:49.251
<i>She liked to bite things</i>
<i>and had four sharp teeth.</i>

03:50.330 --> 03:53.561
<i>There was very little that Sunny</i>
<i>did not enjoy biting.</i>

04:04.244 --> 04:06.075
<i>Sunny was at an age when one</i>
<i>mostly speaks</i>

04:06.279 --> 04:08.804
<i>in a series of unintelligible shrieks.</i>

04:09.082 --> 04:10.549
<i>For instance:</i>

04:11.084 --> 04:12.381
<i>Which probably meant,</i>

04:13.019 --> 04:16.317
<i>"Look at that mysterious figure</i>
<i>emerging from the fog. "</i>

04:16.923 --> 04:18.652
<i>Or perhaps,</i>

04:18.858 --> 04:20.985
<i>"What is a banker like Mr. Poe doing</i>

04:21.261 --> 04:25.163
<i>trudging thorough the sand</i>
<i>to find us at Briny Beach?"</i>

04:29.035 --> 04:30.434
Children,

04:30.637 --> 04:35.506
I'm afraid I must inform you
of an extremely unfortunate event.

04:36.576 --> 04:40.137
I'm very, very sorry to tell you this,
but your parents have perished in a fire

04:40.346 --> 04:42.337
that's destroyed your entire home.

04:43.316 --> 04:46.012
<i>If you have ever lost someone</i>
<i>very important to you,</i>

04:46.319 --> 04:48.514
<i>then you already know how it feels.</i>

04:48.721 --> 04:50.052
<i>And if you haven't,</i>

04:50.390 --> 04:52.688
<i>you cannot possibly imagine it.</i>

05:02.168 --> 05:05.569
<i>No one knows the precise cause</i>
<i>of the Baudelaire fire.</i>

05:05.838 --> 05:08.466
<i>My colleagues and I</i>
<i>have investigated the best we can.</i>

05:08.675 --> 05:10.438
<i>But all we've discovered</i>
<i>is that the blaze</i>

05:10.643 --> 05:12.702
<i>was started from a great distance</i>

05:13.012 --> 05:15.879
<i>through the refraction</i>
<i>and convergence of light.</i>

05:16.182 --> 05:20.312
<i>And within moments,</i>
<i>the entire mansion was in flames.</i>

05:48.681 --> 05:51.411
<i>And as mysterious as the source</i>
<i>of the blaze,</i>

05:51.617 --> 05:55.485
<i>other mysteries began to unfold</i>
<i>before the children's eyes.</i>

05:56.055 --> 06:00.151
<i>Every family has its secrets,</i>
<i>doors left unopened.</i>

06:00.560 --> 06:02.357
<i>But as Klaus now realized,</i>

06:02.562 --> 06:06.589
<i>the smallest discovery would send</i>
<i>his mind reeling with questions.</i>

06:07.200 --> 06:10.135
<i>What was this spyglass hidden</i>
<i>in his father's desk?</i>

06:10.370 --> 06:14.329
<i>Were there other secrets about their</i>
<i>parents' lives yet to be revealed?</i>

06:14.640 --> 06:17.438
<i>Questions he now feared</i>
<i>might never be answered.</i>

06:18.644 --> 06:20.271
<i>And just like that,</i>

06:20.646 --> 06:24.605
<i>the Baudelaire children</i>
<i>became the Baudelaire orphans.</i>

06:26.252 --> 06:28.152
<i>I tried to warn you.</i>

06:37.864 --> 06:40.628
<i>This is an excellent opportunity</i>
<i>to walk out of the theater,</i>

06:40.833 --> 06:44.200
<i>living room or airplane</i>
<i>where this film is being shown.</i>

06:45.538 --> 06:48.905
<i>It's not too late to see a film</i>
<i>about a happy little elf.</i>

06:49.909 --> 06:52.969
Yes. Come with me.

06:55.014 --> 06:58.313
Now, as chief officer
of Mulctuary Management

06:58.518 --> 07:00.315
and the executor of
your parents' estate,

07:00.520 --> 07:03.978
it is my legal obligation to take care
of your money till you come of age

07:04.190 --> 07:07.159
and to place you in the care
of your closest relative.

07:07.393 --> 07:10.157
So I'm taking you to live
with your dear Count Olaf,

07:10.396 --> 07:13.729
who resides right here in the city,
just 37 blocks away.

07:14.033 --> 07:16.501
I don't think that's what "closest"
is supposed to mean.

07:16.702 --> 07:18.363
We don't know a Count Olaf.

07:18.571 --> 07:19.868
Yes, yes, of course you do.

07:20.072 --> 07:21.835
He's either your third cousin
four times removed

07:22.041 --> 07:23.565
or your fourth cousin
three times removed.

07:25.711 --> 07:28.839
And he's an actor by trade.
Isn't that exciting, children?

07:31.117 --> 07:33.244
You should count yourselves
lucky, children.

07:33.553 --> 07:36.784
This sort of generosity is rare
in a person of his profession.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.062
Here we are, your new home.

07:44.997 --> 07:47.022
Isn't it lovely, children?

07:49.068 --> 07:50.365
Oh, hello.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.764
You must be the Baudelaires.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.200
Hi.

07:54.407 --> 07:56.534
I was so sorry to hear
about the accident,

07:56.742 --> 07:59.040
but so happy to hear
you were coming here.

07:59.278 --> 08:01.542
Welcome. I'm Justice Strauss
of the city high court.

08:01.747 --> 08:05.376
I'm Violet. And this is my brother,
Klaus, and my sister, Sunny.

08:05.618 --> 08:07.745
Poe, Mulctuary Management.
How do you do?

08:07.954 --> 08:08.921
Lovely.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.222
Your house is so beautiful.

08:11.457 --> 08:12.549
Thank you.

08:12.758 --> 08:15.818
Please don't be strangers.
You come visit me anytime you like.

08:17.597 --> 08:18.962
- Visit?
- You mean,

08:19.165 --> 08:20.462
you don't live with Count Olaf?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.468
Live with--? With Count Olaf? No.

08:23.769 --> 08:27.466
No, no, no, no. He's--
He's my neighbor.

09:16.989 --> 09:19.014
<i>Entrood</i>.

09:28.334 --> 09:30.393
Haven't got all day. In you go.

09:34.340 --> 09:39.505
Well, hello, hello, hello.

09:39.712 --> 09:43.978
I am your beloved Count Olaf.

09:45.284 --> 09:49.653
And welcome to my loverly home.

09:49.922 --> 09:54.586
May you find solace within
the womblike warmth of its...

09:56.195 --> 09:57.890
...downy plume.

09:58.531 --> 10:02.695
Or as the Greeks
in the ancient times would say:

10:03.102 --> 10:04.592
<i>Orphanis</i>...

10:04.904 --> 10:06.929
...<i>encribo</i>...

10:07.373 --> 10:08.772
...something, something, something.

10:09.041 --> 10:14.604
<i>Music builds to a crescendo</i>
<i>Ending on the right foot</i>

10:14.814 --> 10:16.679
And strike a Fosse.

10:18.784 --> 10:23.050
Not exactly what I was going for,
but you get the idea.

10:32.565 --> 10:35.193
My dear...

10:37.970 --> 10:39.403
...Violet.

10:39.805 --> 10:41.636
<i>Enchant√©.</i>

10:45.177 --> 10:46.769
How do you do?

10:47.313 --> 10:49.941
And this must be Klaus.

10:50.149 --> 10:53.209
Young Klaus.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.622
Your left side is the good one.

10:58.591 --> 11:00.388
And...

11:01.761 --> 11:03.626
...what is this?

11:06.298 --> 11:09.597
I'm sorry, I don't speak monkey.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.227
Banana.

11:13.472 --> 11:14.996
Sunny's our sister.

11:15.775 --> 11:20.109
I must say, you're a gloomy-looking
bunch. Why so glum?

11:21.313 --> 11:23.144
Our parents just died.

11:23.382 --> 11:27.148
Oh, yes, of course.
How very, very awful.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.851
Wait, let me do that one more time.

11:30.122 --> 11:33.148
Give me the line again.
Quickly, while it's fresh in my mind.

11:33.559 --> 11:35.754
Our parents just...

11:36.195 --> 11:37.162
...died?

11:39.532 --> 11:40.863
Oh, yes.

11:44.136 --> 11:45.865
Mr. Poe...

11:47.740 --> 11:50.265
...I will raise these orphans

11:50.509 --> 11:53.967
as if they were actually wanted.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.774
And though you would call it
a burden, a sacrifice,

11:57.983 --> 11:59.951
you are mistaken, sir.

12:00.219 --> 12:02.119
And should be ashamed of yourself.

12:02.321 --> 12:03.788
The idea.

12:07.893 --> 12:11.021
Anyway, where do I sign
for the fortu--? I mean...

12:11.564 --> 12:12.826
...children.

12:13.065 --> 12:18.367
You won't officially have guardianship
until the hearing on Thursday morning.

12:18.637 --> 12:21.470
And what am I to do with them
until then?

12:21.841 --> 12:22.808
Excuse me?

12:23.709 --> 12:24.801
What I mean is...

12:25.010 --> 12:28.468
Do you work out? You look good.
Healthy, I mean.

12:29.615 --> 12:32.083
Well, I'd better get back to the bank.

12:32.284 --> 12:35.481
Can't you stay for a brief imbibement?

12:35.688 --> 12:38.156
A glass of port? Sanka?

12:38.357 --> 12:40.257
- Well, I suppose I could--
- Another time, then.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.221
Children, if you need anything,
do feel free--

12:42.428 --> 12:43.986
Oh, no, we're fine. We're all fine.

12:44.196 --> 12:45.663
Any questions be--

12:50.369 --> 12:52.837
I realize that my humble abode

12:53.038 --> 12:56.371
isn't as fancy
as the Baudelaire mansion,

12:56.709 --> 12:59.837
but I'm coming into a great deal
of money soon,

13:00.079 --> 13:01.944
and I think it'll be

13:02.581 --> 13:05.049
quite charming when it's finished.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.946
Shall we take a look?

13:11.557 --> 13:14.025
This is the living room.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.389
The kitchen.
I know what you're thinking:

13:17.730 --> 13:20.028
"This place could use a little TLC."

13:20.266 --> 13:24.703
I trust you've had your tetanus shots.
Polio. Smallpox. Typhoid. Malaria.

13:24.904 --> 13:27.099
This is the entertainment
or rumpus room.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.806
I'm told the ceiling can be brought
up to code in no time.

13:30.009 --> 13:32.068
You're not afraid of heights, are you?

13:32.611 --> 13:35.739
lmagine that.
A monkey afraid of heights.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.806
My theater.

13:39.018 --> 13:40.713
This way.

13:42.855 --> 13:44.482
What's that up there?

13:49.595 --> 13:51.062
The tower...

13:53.032 --> 13:55.330
...which you are never to enter...

13:57.636 --> 14:00.503
...under any circumstances.

14:08.380 --> 14:11.076
And this is where you'll sleep,
time permitting. Nighty-night.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.979
- But the sun's still up.
- "But the sun's still up."

14:14.386 --> 14:16.115
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>if you've ever noticed this,</i>

14:16.355 --> 14:19.916
<i>but first impressions</i>
<i>are often entirely wrong.</i>

14:20.626 --> 14:25.120
<i>For instance, Klaus, when Sunny</i>
<i>was born, didn't like her at all.</i>

14:25.731 --> 14:29.599
<i>But by the time she was six weeks old,</i>
<i>the two of them were thick as thieves.</i>

14:29.869 --> 14:35.171
<i>A phrase which here means,</i>
<i>"fetching and biting for hours on end. "</i>

14:35.541 --> 14:37.168
<i>In the case of Count Olaf, however...</i>

14:37.476 --> 14:40.104
Orphans!

14:40.546 --> 14:42.104
<i>...they were correct.</i>

14:43.015 --> 14:45.813
<i>Every morning, Count Olaf</i>
<i>would order the Baudelaires</i>

14:46.018 --> 14:48.816
<i>to do a great number</i>
<i>of terrible chores.</i>

14:49.021 --> 14:52.980
<i>After which he would stalk off</i>
<i>to his mysterious tower room.</i>

15:00.866 --> 15:04.097
<i>And as unfortunate</i>
<i>as their situation seemed,</i>

15:04.803 --> 15:06.168
<i>it was only about to get worse.</i>

15:06.372 --> 15:07.999
--tub full of ice in Baja,

15:08.207 --> 15:10.869
and I realized that these clever girls
had stolen my kidney.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.509
- No!
- No!

15:12.711 --> 15:15.612
lmagine my surprise.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.851
Orphans, this is my acting troupe.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.110
Acting troupe, orphans.

15:22.388 --> 15:23.719
They don't look rich.

15:25.391 --> 15:27.552
Ugly little people.

15:32.298 --> 15:35.199
Why aren't you children in the kitchen
preparing our dinner?

15:35.801 --> 15:36.859
Dinner?

15:37.102 --> 15:39.593
It's the French word
for the evening meal.

15:43.575 --> 15:46.066
On the back. Flip it.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.882
We'll take it in the dining room
at 8:00.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.551
And we'll expect absolute silence
while we're rehearsing our play.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.778
- But we've never made dinner before.
- It's already 7:30.

15:56.989 --> 15:57.956
Eight o'clock!

16:16.842 --> 16:18.605
Pasta it is.

16:18.811 --> 16:22.577
Okay. Let's start casting this puppy.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.114
Now,

16:27.119 --> 16:28.950
who shall play

16:29.288 --> 16:32.780
the most handsome count
in all the world?

16:38.030 --> 16:39.964
Would you do it, sir?

16:40.966 --> 16:42.160
Oh, all right.

16:42.468 --> 16:45.995
"Pasta puttanesca." That's Italian
for "very few ingredients," you know.

16:46.305 --> 16:47.499
That's great.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.035
Sunny. Little help.

16:51.877 --> 16:54.209
- Okay, we're gonna need a pot.
- No pot.

16:54.413 --> 16:56.973
- And a strainer.
- No strainer.

16:58.417 --> 16:59.406
Thank you.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.847
And a saucepan.

17:03.088 --> 17:07.047
This is a little piece I like to call
"Electric Chair."

17:12.498 --> 17:15.558
I think you might have to turn it up.

17:16.502 --> 17:18.163
Is anybody out there?!

17:21.507 --> 17:23.634
Strainer. That's brilliant.

17:23.842 --> 17:25.138
Sunny, how's that pot coming?

17:28.781 --> 17:33.650
Sunny, that's not a pot.
It's a spittoon.

17:33.919 --> 17:36.410
A spittoon? You mean, like...?

17:38.190 --> 17:39.316
We'll wash it twice.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.720
Well?

17:44.029 --> 17:45.894
It's good. It's really good.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.098
Time check.

17:47.699 --> 17:50.395
Let's go back to prehistoric times,

17:50.702 --> 17:53.933
when dinosaurs ruled the earth.

18:07.719 --> 18:10.244
Baudelaire orphans
to the courtesy desk.

18:10.456 --> 18:12.424
Baudelaire orphans
to the courtesy desk.

18:24.970 --> 18:25.994
What do you want?

18:26.672 --> 18:28.537
Dinner is served.

18:31.977 --> 18:33.069
Puttanesca.

18:33.445 --> 18:34.776
What did you call me?

18:35.280 --> 18:38.408
It's pasta. Pasta puttanesca.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.379
Where's the roast beef?

18:41.120 --> 18:42.644
Roast beef?

18:43.088 --> 18:44.783
Beef. Yes. Roast beef.

18:45.624 --> 18:48.923
It's the Swedish term for beef
that is roasted.

18:50.462 --> 18:53.158
But you didn't tell us
you wanted roast beef.

18:57.603 --> 19:02.472
You know, there's a big world out there
filled with desperate orphans

19:02.674 --> 19:05.234
who would gladly swim across
an ocean of thumbtacks

19:05.444 --> 19:10.643
just to be eclipsed by the long shadow
that is cast by my accomplishments.

19:11.116 --> 19:13.084
But I don't care about them.

19:13.685 --> 19:16.415
I chose to open my heart

19:16.855 --> 19:20.154
to you two loverly children

19:20.526 --> 19:22.585
and your hideous primate.

19:22.794 --> 19:26.252
All I ask in return is that you do each
and every thing that pops into my head

19:26.465 --> 19:30.595
while I enjoy the enormous fortune
your parents left behind.

19:31.069 --> 19:33.469
- No.
- Why, you litt--

19:48.887 --> 19:53.017
It's time you children learned
a little respect.

19:53.258 --> 19:54.350
You put her down!

19:57.095 --> 19:58.722
You monster!

20:02.067 --> 20:04.297
You all saw it. The boy slipped.

20:04.503 --> 20:06.994
You won't get a cent
until Violet turns 18.

20:07.673 --> 20:09.470
Oh, really?

20:10.008 --> 20:10.975
Says who?

20:11.210 --> 20:12.700
The law. Look it up.

20:12.911 --> 20:15.311
We're going to call Mr. Poe
about this right now.

20:23.422 --> 20:24.719
Are you?

20:27.526 --> 20:30.154
I'm very disappointed
in you, children.

20:33.298 --> 20:35.266
Where were we?

20:35.968 --> 20:37.333
Are you okay?

20:37.536 --> 20:39.003
No.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.005
Klaus, what are you doing?

20:44.276 --> 20:46.267
- I'm going.
- Going where?

20:46.478 --> 20:47.740
Home.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.339
This is our home now.

20:52.718 --> 20:54.447
This is not home.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.548
Home is where your parents
put you to bed at night.

20:57.789 --> 20:59.256
Where they teach you to ride a bike.

20:59.558 --> 21:02.686
Or where they get all choked up
on your first day of school.

21:02.894 --> 21:05.260
This is not home.

21:09.001 --> 21:10.866
How could they do this to us?

21:11.069 --> 21:12.195
They're just bad people.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.830
Not them. Mom and Dad.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.632
- Klaus!
- What?

21:16.842 --> 21:19.868
Violet, you're thinking it too.
How could they?

21:20.145 --> 21:21.772
They had no plan for us at all?

21:22.014 --> 21:24.141
Well, maybe they did have a plan.

21:24.916 --> 21:26.907
Well, sure looks like it to me.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.820
Do you remember
when Mom and Dad went to Europe?

21:38.830 --> 21:41.993
And we thought they'd abandoned us
because they didn't even write.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.895
Then we found out they'd written
a long letter.

21:44.102 --> 21:45.433
It had just gotten lost in the mail.

21:45.637 --> 21:49.129
Do you remember how guilty we felt
for thinking bad thoughts about them?

21:50.676 --> 21:51.836
This is just like that.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.410
No, it's not.

21:55.347 --> 21:56.575
Why?

21:58.850 --> 22:02.809
Because they're not in Europe.
They're not coming back.

22:09.995 --> 22:14.159
Do you think anything
will ever feel like home again?

22:27.713 --> 22:29.203
<i>"Sanctuary"</i>

22:29.514 --> 22:34.816
<i>is a word which here means, "a small,</i>
<i>safe place in a troubling world. "</i>

22:36.021 --> 22:41.049
<i>Like an oasis in a vast desert</i>
<i>or an island in a stormy sea.</i>

22:41.293 --> 22:44.057
<i>The Baudelaires enjoyed their evening</i>
<i>in the sanctuary they'd built together.</i>

22:44.262 --> 22:45.229
I see it. I see it.

22:45.430 --> 22:49.799
<i>But in their hearts they knew that</i>
<i>the troubling world lay just outside.</i>

22:50.035 --> 22:53.869
<i>A world which, I'm sad to say,</i>
<i>can be described in two dismal words.</i>

22:54.172 --> 22:56.003
Custody granted.

22:58.877 --> 23:02.506
Thank you, Your Honor.
Nice doing business with you.

23:09.554 --> 23:14.014
Children, I've been contemplating
our situation,

23:14.226 --> 23:19.425
and I realize that I've been
a bit standoffish, shall we say.

23:19.698 --> 23:22.030
Which in this case is a big,
big word meaning--

23:22.234 --> 23:23.565
Pure evil.

23:23.802 --> 23:26.327
--tough, but fair.

23:26.872 --> 23:29.568
But now that we're family,
I can make it up to you.

23:29.775 --> 23:32.938
I can be the ultimate dad.

23:33.278 --> 23:35.610
I know. Let's stop for a treat.

23:40.318 --> 23:41.910
Soda. Soda. Banana.

23:44.322 --> 23:45.516
Got it.

24:05.210 --> 24:09.203
Violet, where'd the locks go?

24:16.755 --> 24:20.486
Hello. I'm going on a perfectly
innocent ride in the country

24:20.692 --> 24:22.990
with my kids, whom I love.

24:23.261 --> 24:24.888
Is that clock correct?

24:31.036 --> 24:32.628
What is it?

24:33.605 --> 24:35.732
I think it's a schedule.

24:56.228 --> 25:00.858
Kiwi Watermelon Surprise. My favorite.

25:11.977 --> 25:13.103
Go!

25:18.817 --> 25:21.445
- He took the keys.
- Try everything.

25:29.828 --> 25:33.286
<i>Chit-chattery chipmunks all singing</i>--

25:36.368 --> 25:37.801
<i>Count Olaf? Hello. Poe.</i>

25:38.036 --> 25:40.971
I'm calling you back about
that inheritance question you raised.

25:41.206 --> 25:42.969
- Mr. Poe, thank goodness.
- Who is this?

25:43.208 --> 25:45.142
It's Violet Baudelaire.
We're in Count Olaf's car.

25:45.343 --> 25:47.140
Oh, hello, Violet.
Well, where's Count Olaf?

25:47.379 --> 25:48.471
He's not here right now, but--

25:48.713 --> 25:50.647
You're driving the car alone?

25:50.882 --> 25:53.646
No. We're-- The car's on the train
tracks, and the train is coming.

25:53.852 --> 25:58.312
I'm sorry, Violet, I can't hear a thing.
I'm driving next to a train!

25:58.557 --> 26:00.821
We're going to be hit by a train.

26:01.026 --> 26:04.484
Right. Yes. I can't hear
because of the train!

26:04.729 --> 26:07.994
<i>I'll call you back when I get</i>
<i>to the bank! Goodbye!</i>

26:13.705 --> 26:18.335
Klaus, you've read books on trains.
What do we do?

26:25.083 --> 26:26.380
The track switcher.

26:26.651 --> 26:27.845
There!

26:31.556 --> 26:32.682
It's too far away.

26:32.891 --> 26:35.792
No. There has to be something
we can use to pull it.

26:35.994 --> 26:38.963
- There's nothing in here.
- There's always something.

26:40.899 --> 26:42.799
Sunny, bite the head off that elf.

27:18.003 --> 27:19.129
Quick, pull it back in.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.644
- Violet.
- I got it.

27:27.946 --> 27:29.573
I don't mean to rush you.

27:35.787 --> 27:37.482
- Nice shot.
- Thank you. Pull.

28:38.783 --> 28:43.652
Mr. Poe. Dear Mr. Poe. Can't we
discuss this like reasonable men?

28:43.855 --> 28:45.254
I'm sorry, Count Olaf.

28:45.457 --> 28:47.448
Allowing a child of Sunny's age
to drive a car

28:47.659 --> 28:48.751
is simply not good parenting.

28:48.960 --> 28:49.984
He tried to kill us.

28:50.195 --> 28:53.494
Let us not exaggerate, Klaus.
The vehicle was not even in gear.

28:54.299 --> 28:58.998
May I have a moment
alone with the children?

29:03.742 --> 29:05.107
Goodbye, kids.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.268
It's been fun.

29:07.545 --> 29:09.308
I'm going to get you.
No matter where you go,

29:09.514 --> 29:12.540
no matter what you do, I'll find you.

29:12.951 --> 29:15.579
You are so deceased.

29:20.892 --> 29:22.621
Take them, Mr. Poe...

29:23.995 --> 29:26.293
...before I lose it, bigtime.

29:27.499 --> 29:29.126
<i>Trumping a talentless villain</i>

29:29.400 --> 29:32.563
<i>might seem all in a day's work</i>
<i>for three ingenious orphans.</i>

29:32.971 --> 29:35.235
<i>But the Baudelaires</i>
<i>savored their victory</i>

29:35.440 --> 29:38.068
<i>as they sped</i>
<i>towards their new home.</i>

29:38.309 --> 29:40.539
<i>What lay ahead for them</i>
<i>was unclear,</i>

29:40.779 --> 29:42.974
<i>but they remained</i>
<i>cautiously optimistic</i>

29:43.181 --> 29:46.207
<i>that their next guardian would be</i>
<i>better than the last.</i>

29:46.451 --> 29:50.148
<i>Or at least wouldn't try</i>
<i>to flatten them with a train.</i>

29:56.594 --> 29:59.722
Do you know
what kind of scientist he is?

29:59.931 --> 30:02.491
No, I don't. I was far too busy
making arrangements for you three.

30:02.700 --> 30:03.894
I didn't have time for chitchat.

30:04.169 --> 30:05.397
Hello!

30:06.104 --> 30:09.972
Oh, my goodness.

30:10.208 --> 30:13.075
Look at you. You must be Violet.

30:13.278 --> 30:15.473
Do you remember me?
I don't suppose so.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.739
You were just a little baby
at the time.

30:18.016 --> 30:21.247
And, Klaus, we've never met.
How do you d--?

30:21.886 --> 30:25.083
What a firm grip.
Like a Burmese python.

30:25.356 --> 30:30.658
And Sunny. Little Sunny. You look
so much like your dear mother.

30:31.129 --> 30:34.621
Thank you very much, Mr. Poe.
I'll take it from here.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.097
Oh, perhaps I should come inside.

30:37.302 --> 30:38.792
Oh, by all means.

30:39.637 --> 30:41.400
You could help us pick out
the gut worms

30:41.606 --> 30:43.437
from the bowel of the Viscid Boa.

30:44.075 --> 30:47.101
Children, remember,
if you need me anytime,

30:47.312 --> 30:50.770
you can reach me by phone or fax.

30:51.015 --> 30:52.175
Good day.

30:56.154 --> 30:58.145
Well, we got rid of him, didn't we?

30:58.389 --> 31:01.654
Come in. Come in. There's not
much time, and we have to pack.

31:02.827 --> 31:04.021
Pack?

31:06.464 --> 31:07.522
Did you say "pack"?

31:07.732 --> 31:10.997
Oh, yes. We have to pack
all the equipment.

31:11.402 --> 31:13.836
Then there's the essentials,
like clothing and such.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.506
And we have to tag all of the snakes
who are coming with us.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.834
Coming where?

31:18.042 --> 31:20.169
Oh, did I mention we're going
to Peru?

31:20.378 --> 31:22.710
- No.
- Yes, we're going to Peru.

31:22.914 --> 31:26.179
Tomorrow morning.
Isn't that exciting?

31:26.384 --> 31:27.851
This way to the Reptile Room.

31:30.555 --> 31:33.524
Welcome to my humble abode.

31:33.925 --> 31:36.519
You children know anything
about snakes?

31:37.228 --> 31:38.855
Only what I've read in books.

31:39.264 --> 31:41.027
No, not very much.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.794
Well, we may have one or two things
here that aren't in books.

31:46.938 --> 31:51.534
I'll just put the big fellow in his bed and
introduce you to a few of me friends.

31:52.410 --> 31:53.877
Over here...

31:54.078 --> 31:55.375
That's the two-headed cobra.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.548
Well spotted.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.216
Is that a he or a she?

31:59.584 --> 32:02.052
I have no idea.
Didn't think it polite to ask.

32:02.587 --> 32:06.216
And over here,
the Tibetan Third-Eye Toad.

32:06.424 --> 32:09.791
We can't stop this fellow chanting.
Om. Ribbit.

32:10.194 --> 32:14.062
And now, children, you have
to see my latest discovery.

32:14.265 --> 32:19.066
Found him in Tanzania. One of a kind.
The Incredibly Deadly Viper.

32:19.704 --> 32:24.334
My assistant, Gustav, and I may be
the only people ever to have seen him.

32:51.002 --> 32:54.494
<i>Oh, I'm sorry. My ribbon just jammed.</i>

32:54.739 --> 32:56.707
<i>Let me just adjust it here.</i>

32:58.476 --> 32:59.443
<i>Right.</i>

32:59.644 --> 33:00.668
<i>There we are.</i>

33:00.979 --> 33:02.105
<i>Now,</i>

33:02.814 --> 33:03.974
<i>where was I?</i>

33:04.248 --> 33:06.944
<i>Oh, yes. The attack</i>
<i>of the Incredibly Deadly Viper.</i>

33:08.186 --> 33:11.314
Not to worry, little one.
You're all right.

33:11.522 --> 33:14.184
It can't possibly harm you.
Here we go.

33:14.559 --> 33:17.687
The Incredibly Deadly Viper
couldn't have possibly harmed her?

33:17.929 --> 33:19.658
No. No, no, no, no.

33:21.699 --> 33:23.223
It's a big softy.

33:23.534 --> 33:26.025
One of the least harmful
and most friendly creatures

33:26.237 --> 33:27.499
in the animal kingdom.

33:27.705 --> 33:28.865
It's a misnomer.

33:29.073 --> 33:32.406
I only called him that to play a prank
on those stuffed shirts

33:32.610 --> 33:34.635
down at the Herpetological Society.

33:34.879 --> 33:37.643
Uncle Monty,
why are we going to Peru?

33:38.082 --> 33:39.879
Just this morning I was wondering,

33:40.084 --> 33:42.348
"How are we all going to get
out of town together?"

33:42.553 --> 33:46.011
And I thought, "Peru."
They have snakes in Peru, don't they?

33:46.224 --> 33:48.749
But why are we getting out of town?

33:50.361 --> 33:54.320
Violet, do you know snakes are more
afraid of you than you are of them?

33:55.700 --> 33:57.190
Few people do.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.561
When threatened,
a snake will retreat to a place

34:00.772 --> 34:04.003
that is quiet, safe, remote.

34:05.109 --> 34:10.172
A sanctuary.
Where it can feel out of danger.

34:12.083 --> 34:13.744
That's why Peru.

34:18.089 --> 34:20.523
Wait, that spyglass.
I saw one just like that in our dad's--

34:20.725 --> 34:22.522
Plenty of time for chitchat later.

34:22.760 --> 34:25.524
But right now, what I need
is an inventor,

34:25.730 --> 34:27.061
a reader

34:27.264 --> 34:28.891
and a biter.

34:29.100 --> 34:30.226
Know any?

34:37.775 --> 34:42.268
<i>High upon Highlands</i>
<i>And low upon Tay</i>

34:43.581 --> 34:48.780
<i>Bonnie George Campbell</i>
<i>Rode out on a day</i>

34:49.754 --> 34:54.782
<i>Saddled and bridled</i>
<i>So gallant rode he</i>

34:55.592 --> 35:00.587
<i>Home came his good horse</i>
<i>But never came he</i>

35:02.967 --> 35:06.596
Petunia, what have I told you
about this?

35:06.804 --> 35:09.102
She thinks I'm a tree, you know.

35:09.941 --> 35:14.742
I think I know that song. I think-- I think
our parents used to play it for us.

35:14.946 --> 35:18.074
They certainly did. As I did for mine.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.773
- You had children?
- Oh, yes.

35:21.452 --> 35:23.784
And a wife and a home.

35:25.490 --> 35:26.616
Until the fire.

35:28.025 --> 35:29.322
A fire?

35:30.795 --> 35:33.821
I may know better than anyone
what you're going through.

35:35.333 --> 35:36.925
But it's gonna be all right.

35:37.468 --> 35:41.962
We'll be among people who
understand us. People who are like us.

35:42.473 --> 35:44.634
People who appreciate
unique children

35:44.842 --> 35:50.144
who can read and invent
and bite things.

35:52.517 --> 35:55.645
Uncle Monty, why are you doing
all this for us?

35:57.321 --> 35:59.482
Isn't that what family does?

36:00.358 --> 36:03.816
<i>"And so the Baudelaire children</i>
<i>went to Peru</i>

36:04.028 --> 36:05.757
<i>and together had</i>
<i>wonderful adventures</i>

36:05.963 --> 36:09.330
<i>with their loving</i>
<i>and wonderful new guardian.</i>

36:10.001 --> 36:11.992
<i>The end. "</i>

36:13.838 --> 36:16.500
<i>These are the words</i>
<i>I desperately wish I could type.</i>

36:16.841 --> 36:21.141
<i>Oh, I would give anything</i>
<i>to say that the story ends here.</i>

36:21.345 --> 36:24.007
<i>But alas, my mission is</i>
<i>not to weave happy endings</i>

36:24.215 --> 36:27.514
<i>where they do not occur</i>
<i>but to report the actual events</i>

36:27.718 --> 36:30.881
<i>in the lives of the unfortunate</i>
<i>Baudelaire children.</i>

36:31.856 --> 36:33.687
<i>And as much as it pains me,</i>

36:33.891 --> 36:37.691
<i>I must confess that their troubles</i>
<i>had only just begun.</i>

36:37.929 --> 36:40.989
<i>And it did so with two musical notes.</i>

36:56.280 --> 36:57.542
Hello.

36:57.748 --> 37:02.412
I am looking
for Dr. Montgomery Montgomery.

37:04.222 --> 37:07.714
I am Stephano. I am an Italian man,

37:08.059 --> 37:13.361
and I am here to assist him
in his research as best I can.

37:13.564 --> 37:17.694
As well as to facilitate
and remain observatory.

37:17.902 --> 37:19.392
You're Count Olaf.

37:24.642 --> 37:28.043
Now, why would you say
something like that?

37:28.579 --> 37:32.276
I have never met such a person
as a Count Olaf,

37:32.583 --> 37:34.915
but if I had,

37:35.119 --> 37:39.715
I'm sure he would look and sound
completely different.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.252
You're Olaf,
and we're not letting you in.

37:48.299 --> 37:52.929
Well, perhaps you should re-evaluate
your hypothesis.

37:53.604 --> 37:57.597
Anyway, that's why you should
never run with one of these, kids.

37:57.842 --> 38:00.470
Words of wisdom indeed,
Mr. Stephano.

38:00.678 --> 38:03.272
Oops, you caught me being
a mentor.

38:03.514 --> 38:06.483
And bless you for coming
at such short notice.

38:06.717 --> 38:08.309
Not at all, not at all.

38:08.552 --> 38:12.420
My chief assistant, Gustav, took sick
and phoned not one hour ago.

38:12.623 --> 38:15.091
He'd give anything
to be here right now.

38:18.696 --> 38:20.596
Thank goodness you were available.

38:20.865 --> 38:25.768
Well, I am a fan, if I may gush.

38:26.037 --> 38:29.268
Your work has profoundly influenced
my research

38:29.473 --> 38:32.601
up at the Monterey Bay Aquarium...

38:34.312 --> 38:35.609
...on the sea snake.

38:36.213 --> 38:38.773
It's a very volatile animal.

38:39.050 --> 38:44.352
- Perhaps we should--
- I've been bitten 43... 700 times.

38:44.889 --> 38:46.356
Mostly on the face.

38:46.557 --> 38:49.526
A lot of this has been reconstructed.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.294
But I think they did one heck of a job,

38:51.495 --> 38:54.794
even though my mustache
is a tad askew.

38:58.002 --> 39:01.460
I wonder if I could get the kids
to help me in with my bags.

39:01.739 --> 39:04.799
My left side is somewhat
neurologically challenged.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.703
- But of course. Children--
- Uncle Monty--

39:07.011 --> 39:11.141
Please. Let us not be rude
to our guest.

39:11.415 --> 39:12.643
Now, go on.

39:13.918 --> 39:15.317
What's he up to?

39:15.519 --> 39:16.508
I don't know.

39:16.754 --> 39:21.157
<i>There is no good moment, of course,</i>
<i>for a notorious villain to arrive.</i>

39:21.359 --> 39:23.327
<i>But the timing</i>
<i>of Olaf's reappearance,</i>

39:23.527 --> 39:26.985
<i>just when Dr. Montgomery's secret</i>
<i>could be revealed to the children,</i>

39:27.231 --> 39:29.893
<i>was almost more</i>
<i>than Klaus could bear.</i>

39:30.134 --> 39:31.431
Violet, listen to me.

39:31.869 --> 39:35.168
Monty's spyglass. I saw
the exact same one in Dad's desk.

39:35.973 --> 39:38.908
- Klaus, it's just a coincidence.
- Violet, no.

39:39.110 --> 39:41.010
Everything happens for a reason.

39:41.212 --> 39:44.511
Now, the children will be helping us
extensively with the research in Peru.

39:44.715 --> 39:46.182
Do you have experience
with children?

39:46.384 --> 39:49.683
Children are strange
and foreign to me.

39:50.621 --> 39:52.020
I never really was one.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.590
I know that they are
an important part of the ecosystem.

39:55.893 --> 39:57.793
He's never gonna let us alone
with Monty.

39:57.995 --> 39:59.428
We've gotta get a message to him.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.530
Leave that to me.

40:02.800 --> 40:05.030
I was feeding the moray,

40:05.469 --> 40:09.200
and of course, I got cocky.

40:09.407 --> 40:13.275
And that's all it takes.
That's all it takes, is one time.

40:16.080 --> 40:17.206
Just once.

40:17.481 --> 40:20.211
I had the kipper in my mouth,
and I offered it.

40:20.484 --> 40:23.976
And there was a team from
National Geographic that were there.

40:24.188 --> 40:25.553
They were filming the whole thing.

40:25.756 --> 40:29.283
And, well, a lot of people don't
know this about the moray,

40:29.493 --> 40:32.223
but you think, you know, "This can't be
a tremendously strong animal."

40:32.430 --> 40:34.728
I mean, sure, it has a certain amount
of strength,

40:34.932 --> 40:38.265
but how does it pull a man's face
into a cave?

40:38.769 --> 40:40.930
Anyway, long story short,

40:41.172 --> 40:43.470
the bends,
a reconstructive surgery...

40:43.674 --> 40:48.805
But yes, from my understanding,
Peru is a wonderful place.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.978
The beaches. The people.

40:51.215 --> 40:52.409
The relaxed guardianship laws.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.751
Relaxed guardianship laws?

40:57.488 --> 40:58.955
Did I say that?

41:00.558 --> 41:01.923
Darn neurotoxins.

41:02.293 --> 41:06.662
Oh, Stephano, you have
a wonderful gift for storytelling.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.660
- Doesn't he, children?
- Oh, yeah.

41:09.867 --> 41:12.927
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
milking Petunia for me.

41:13.137 --> 41:18.439
Petunia. Well, the milking...
Now, see, what I was--

41:18.642 --> 41:19.836
Could I just...?

41:20.044 --> 41:22.945
Yeah, sure. I'll take a shot at that.

41:23.380 --> 41:27.009
Now, they used to call me Old
MacDonald up at the milking lab there,

41:27.218 --> 41:29.152
because I'd milk these things
all day long.

41:29.420 --> 41:33.151
But the little udders
are hard to locate.

41:34.692 --> 41:37.684
Anyway, why don't you take that

41:37.928 --> 41:40.692
and go ahead and start the party
without me, and then...

41:40.998 --> 41:45.992
I'm not sure I brought my milking gear.
I'll take a gander.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.812
Is he still watching?

42:00.184 --> 42:01.310
Yes.

42:01.785 --> 42:03.776
Don't look at me.
Pretend you're talking to Klaus.

42:03.988 --> 42:05.819
Okay.

42:06.023 --> 42:09.322
I got your message.
Don't worry. I know.

42:09.527 --> 42:11.495
- You do?
- Yes.

42:11.695 --> 42:14.664
A moray eel would never eat kippers.
Far too salty.

42:15.032 --> 42:17.364
And did you see the way he kept
glancing into my satchel,

42:17.568 --> 42:19.695
where I keep
the exotic snake venoms?

42:20.037 --> 42:23.939
You children were right.
Stephano is an imposter.

42:24.141 --> 42:25.108
Yes.

42:25.309 --> 42:27.038
He's a spy from
the Herpetological Society.

42:27.244 --> 42:29.439
He's here to steal
the Incredibly Deadly Viper.

42:29.680 --> 42:30.647
- No.
- No. Uncle Monty--

42:33.117 --> 42:38.419
Darn. All finished. I was
so looking forward to the milking.

42:39.290 --> 42:41.656
Isn't it about time you kids
went to bed?

42:41.859 --> 42:45.818
Absolutely.
Early start tomorrow, children.

42:46.030 --> 42:47.258
Off you go.

42:48.198 --> 42:49.358
Good night.

42:54.805 --> 42:58.434
Oh, and if you kids should get
restless during the night,

42:58.709 --> 43:02.440
I'm right down the hall,
and I'm a very light sleeper.

43:02.713 --> 43:07.116
In fact, I hardly sleep at all.

43:19.163 --> 43:21.290
Do you have a hall pass?

43:24.902 --> 43:26.802
I didn't think so.

43:27.605 --> 43:31.473
Oh, Petunia, I'm going to miss you.

43:32.743 --> 43:35.803
You're such a good girl, aren't you?

43:36.747 --> 43:38.374
Such a pretty girl.

43:38.916 --> 43:42.215
You are. Yes, you are.

43:44.254 --> 43:46.882
Oh, yes, you are.

43:48.258 --> 43:51.159
<i>It is a curious thing,</i>
<i>the death of a loved one.</i>

43:53.430 --> 43:54.988
Uncle Monty?

43:55.199 --> 43:58.168
<i>It's like walking up the stairs</i>
<i>to your bedroom in the dark</i>

43:58.369 --> 44:01.702
<i>and thinking that there's</i>
<i>one more stair than there is.</i>

44:02.373 --> 44:04.534
<i>Your foot falls down through the air,</i>

44:04.742 --> 44:07.905
<i>and there's a sickly moment</i>
<i>of dark surprise.</i>

44:10.080 --> 44:11.069
Uncle Monty?

44:16.787 --> 44:19.347
<i>The children's grief</i>
<i>was not only for their uncle</i>

44:19.590 --> 44:23.117
<i>but for that tender hope that they</i>
<i>may have found home again.</i>

44:23.394 --> 44:26.522
<i>A hope which, thanks to a villainous</i>
<i>actor, was now slowly tumbling away.</i>

44:32.803 --> 44:35.601
I do feel somewhat responsible
for this tragedy.

44:35.806 --> 44:39.037
I should've taken it upon myself
to warn him

44:39.276 --> 44:40.800
that the Incredibly Deadly Viper

44:41.011 --> 44:44.037
is the most deadly snake
in the entire ecosystem.

44:44.248 --> 44:47.217
I should know. I discovered it.

44:47.418 --> 44:48.783
You what?

44:49.019 --> 44:50.281
Detective?

44:51.155 --> 44:55.114
Little girl, the big cage door is open,
no snake. Dead guy.

44:55.325 --> 44:56.553
You know what I'm thinking?

44:56.760 --> 44:59.593
I'm thinking, "Who woke me up
at 9 in the morning for this?"

45:00.297 --> 45:03.095
It's definitely a snake bite.
There's no question about it.

45:03.300 --> 45:05.097
Snake bite, no question about it.
Thanks, doc.

45:05.369 --> 45:08.236
You don't understand, the Incredibly
Deadly Viper couldn't have killed him,

45:08.439 --> 45:10.930
because it's one of the least dangerous
and most friendly creatures

45:11.141 --> 45:12.335
in the animal kingdom.

45:12.609 --> 45:14.304
You mind if I skip the paperwork
on this?

45:14.645 --> 45:18.945
I think that'd be best. These kids
have been through a major upheaval.

45:19.516 --> 45:22.974
I wonder if it's a good idea, even,
to change their plans at this point.

45:23.287 --> 45:25.949
We were headed for Peru tomorrow,

45:26.156 --> 45:28.522
- and the tickets are nonrefundable.
- No.

45:28.726 --> 45:29.715
Doc, what do you think?

45:29.960 --> 45:32.485
Could be the only chance
for them to get closure.

45:33.864 --> 45:35.229
Closure. Thank you, doc.

45:35.432 --> 45:37.491
<i>From interviews with witnesses</i>
<i>who were there that day,</i>

45:37.701 --> 45:41.364
<i>I have learned the following about</i>
<i>the youngest Baudelaire's plan:</i>

45:41.638 --> 45:43.367
<i>Brave Sunny started here</i>

45:43.640 --> 45:45.335
<i>and approached</i>
<i>the Incredibly Deadly Viper</i>

45:45.542 --> 45:47.601
<i>with single-minded determination.</i>

45:47.911 --> 45:51.108
No, he's Count Olaf,
and that doctor is his accomplice.

45:51.348 --> 45:52.713
He tried to kill us with a train.

45:52.916 --> 45:55.976
- And where would this man get a train?
- Where am I gonna get a train?

45:56.253 --> 45:57.880
Children, that's enough
of this foolishness.

45:58.155 --> 46:00.953
Mr. Stephano bears absolutely
no resemblance to Count Olaf.

46:01.158 --> 46:04.787
Who is this incredibly handsome
Count Olaf they keep speaking of?

46:04.995 --> 46:08.761
Count Olaf is their old guardian,
who made an error in judgment.

46:09.500 --> 46:13.459
What about the tattoo? Count Olaf
had a tattoo of an eye on his ankle.

46:14.171 --> 46:16.139
Anything for the kids.

46:17.875 --> 46:20.639
Voil√†! Spick-and-span.

46:20.944 --> 46:22.969
Well, he's an actor.
He covered it with makeup.

46:25.048 --> 46:27.676
Doctor, I wonder if you
could help me escort

46:27.885 --> 46:30.319
- these young children to the vehicle.
- No. Mr. Poe--

46:30.521 --> 46:32.250
- No, Mr. Poe!
- I'll send you a postcard.

46:32.456 --> 46:34.617
<i>About one thing,</i>
<i>all the witnesses agreed.</i>

46:34.858 --> 46:39.625
<i>The sound they heard next</i>
<i>was so shocking, so surprising,</i>

46:39.863 --> 46:42.195
<i>it still haunts them to this day.</i>

46:52.075 --> 46:56.341
Damn it. This was
such a good character.

47:18.531 --> 47:21.500
<i>Bum buttery, bluebird is singing a tune</i>

47:21.701 --> 47:26.070
Rest assured, children, the authorities
are in hot pursuit of Mr. Stephano,

47:26.272 --> 47:29.764
from his eyebrowless forehead
to his untattooed ankle.

47:30.176 --> 47:31.871
The Italian fiend.

47:32.078 --> 47:34.546
<i>Though still in the clutches</i>
<i>of a clueless banker,</i>

47:34.747 --> 47:37.375
<i>the Baudelaires celebrated</i>
<i>their unmasking of Count Olaf</i>

47:37.584 --> 47:41.418
<i>as they skimmed their way across</i>
<i>the icy surface of Lake Lachrymose.</i>

47:41.688 --> 47:45.522
<i>But Klaus wasn't the sort to think</i>
<i>on the surface of anything.</i>

47:45.725 --> 47:47.886
<i>He knew there was something</i>
<i>beneath their journey,</i>

47:48.094 --> 47:50.824
<i>even though all he had to go on</i>
<i>was a spyglass,</i>

47:51.030 --> 47:55.330
<i>the knowledge of another terrible fire</i>
<i>and two words on a slip of paper.</i>

47:55.535 --> 47:57.503
Aunt Josephine?

47:58.137 --> 47:59.832
Never heard of her.

48:01.374 --> 48:05.242
Does it strike you as odd that none
of our relatives are related to us?

48:21.961 --> 48:23.519
Aunt Josephine?

48:25.398 --> 48:28.196
Baudelaires? Is that you?

48:28.434 --> 48:29.594
Yes.

48:31.104 --> 48:32.401
Oh, good.

48:32.705 --> 48:33.729
Come in. Come in. Come in.

48:33.940 --> 48:37.068
Hurricane Herman
is about to arrive at any time now.

48:38.912 --> 48:42.245
Oh, Violet. Look at you.

48:42.482 --> 48:43.710
Hello.

48:43.917 --> 48:45.885
Come in, quickly. Quickly, children.

48:46.119 --> 48:47.450
- What? What?
- What's the matter?

48:47.754 --> 48:51.747
Not that quickly. You could trip
over the welcome mat

48:51.991 --> 48:53.288
and decapitate yourselves.

48:54.627 --> 48:59.257
So, quickly, but not too quickly,
all right?

49:13.513 --> 49:16.573
I'm sorry it's so chilly in here.

49:16.983 --> 49:20.749
Sometimes it gets so cold
I can hardly stand it.

49:20.987 --> 49:23.649
Would you like me to turn the radiator
up for you, Aunt Josephine?

49:23.957 --> 49:28.121
Oh, no. I never turn on the radiator.
I'm frightened that it might explode.

49:29.329 --> 49:33.493
Children, I must ask you not to use
any of the doorknobs in the house.

49:34.200 --> 49:38.933
Just push on the wood of the door,
and it'll open.

49:39.305 --> 49:40.272
Why?

49:40.707 --> 49:42.766
Well, I'm always afraid
that the doorknobs

49:42.976 --> 49:44.671
will shatter into a million tiny pieces,

49:44.877 --> 49:46.606
and one of them will hit my eye.

49:51.484 --> 49:53.782
"Delmo" is not a word.

49:54.354 --> 49:57.949
I can see that I'm going to have to
teach her proper English.

50:03.496 --> 50:07.489
Grammar is the greatest joy in life,
don't you find?

50:07.734 --> 50:09.031
- Most definitely.
- I love grammar.

50:18.177 --> 50:19.804
Perfect. Nice hot soup.

50:20.513 --> 50:23.812
Actually, it's chilled cucumber soup.

50:24.050 --> 50:25.483
I never cook anything hot.

50:25.718 --> 50:28.551
I'm afraid that the stove
will burst into flames.

50:28.921 --> 50:29.979
Where's your brother?

50:30.523 --> 50:31.490
The kitchen.

50:32.225 --> 50:33.192
Klaus?

50:34.527 --> 50:35.721
What are you doing?

50:36.195 --> 50:37.162
Napkins.

50:38.231 --> 50:42.497
Napkins are here. Come away from
the fridge. If it falls, it'll crush you flat.

50:44.203 --> 50:45.500
All right.

50:46.039 --> 50:48.940
Everyone, would you like
to see some pictures?

50:52.779 --> 50:54.713
Careful. Don't get a paper cut.

50:58.217 --> 50:59.184
Is this lke?

51:01.421 --> 51:02.718
Wasn't he handsome?

51:07.393 --> 51:09.725
All the things you did,
Aunt Josephine.

51:10.396 --> 51:11.727
You tamed lions?

51:12.465 --> 51:17.698
Oh, I was quite adventurous
when lke was alive.

51:32.251 --> 51:34.913
Uncle Monty?
You knew Uncle Monty?

51:35.121 --> 51:37.783
No. That's not a good picture of me.

51:37.990 --> 51:40.550
Wait, is...? Is that our parents?

51:40.760 --> 51:42.557
Was this some sort of club?

51:42.962 --> 51:45.226
Why do you all have
these spyglasses?

51:45.431 --> 51:50.232
I don't like the way I look
in that picture.

51:54.340 --> 51:56.467
Did lke die in a fire?

51:56.809 --> 51:59.972
No, no, no, no. Silly child, no.

52:00.813 --> 52:02.906
He was eaten by leeches.

52:06.285 --> 52:07.616
Come, I'll show you.

52:12.992 --> 52:17.486
Watch the chandelier, children.
If it falls, it will impale you.

52:37.817 --> 52:43.119
Ike and I explored every cove and inlet
of Lake Lachrymose,

52:43.322 --> 52:45.790
from Horrid Harbor,

52:46.025 --> 52:50.860
all the way over to Curdled Cave,
way over there.

52:51.364 --> 52:54.492
And near that rock is
where the leeches attacked.

52:58.204 --> 53:00.172
Lachrymose leeches have six rows

53:00.373 --> 53:03.035
of very sharp teeth,
and one very sharp nose.

53:03.342 --> 53:07.676
They are blind, but they can smell food
on a human from miles away.

53:07.880 --> 53:11.976
And if they smell food,
they will swarm.

53:15.221 --> 53:20.523
I told him, "lke, you must wait one hour
before going into the water."

53:21.060 --> 53:22.186
But...

53:23.196 --> 53:27.496
...he only waited 45 minutes,

53:27.700 --> 53:28.894
and...

53:37.710 --> 53:40.577
I apologize, children.

53:41.380 --> 53:42.677
Klaus!

53:43.216 --> 53:46.413
That area is private.
That was lke's room.

53:50.389 --> 53:53.381
Oh, God, I hate it here.

53:55.228 --> 53:58.664
Well, Aunt Josephine,
have you ever thought

53:58.865 --> 54:00.355
of maybe moving someplace else?

54:00.566 --> 54:04.195
Maybe if you moved away from Lake
Lachrymose you might feel better.

54:05.304 --> 54:07.363
I could never,

54:07.640 --> 54:11.872
never, never, never sell this house.

54:13.246 --> 54:15.544
I'm terrified of realtors.

54:15.915 --> 54:18.281
<i>There are two kinds of fears:</i>

54:18.584 --> 54:21.451
<i>rational and irrational.</i>

54:22.088 --> 54:25.387
<i>Being afraid of realtors</i>
<i>is an irrational fear.</i>

54:25.591 --> 54:27.058
Is this a bad time?

54:32.598 --> 54:34.429
We gotta get her out of the house.

54:42.141 --> 54:46.305
Watch out for those avocados. The pit
could become lodged in our throats.

54:46.612 --> 54:51.140
And watch out for that cart.
It could break free and run us over.

54:52.285 --> 54:54.583
Everything's fine, Aunt Josephine.

54:55.054 --> 54:57.852
Lord thundering jumped-up Jehovah.

54:58.057 --> 54:59.718
The black plague!
Is it the black plague?

54:59.926 --> 55:01.518
No, that there was all my fault.

55:01.794 --> 55:03.989
Tell you what, can't tell you
how sorry I is

55:04.196 --> 55:06.790
for running into your sister there
like that.

55:06.999 --> 55:08.057
Aunt Josephine, this--

55:08.267 --> 55:10.098
Couple of right beauties
you are, mum.

55:10.369 --> 55:11.495
Especially you.

55:11.737 --> 55:13.261
Aunt Josephine--

55:13.539 --> 55:15.029
But allow me to introduce meself.

55:15.274 --> 55:17.174
No, allow Klaus and I to introduce him.

55:17.443 --> 55:19.411
- This--
- "Klaus and me."

55:19.612 --> 55:20.909
It doesn't matter. This is--

55:21.113 --> 55:22.341
Doesn't matter?

55:23.950 --> 55:25.417
Are you jigging me, girl?

55:25.718 --> 55:30.178
Why, perhaps it's just the ramblings
of an expert fisherman,

55:30.389 --> 55:32.289
but grammar is the number-one
most important thing

55:32.491 --> 55:34.516
in this here world to me.

55:34.894 --> 55:35.918
It is?

55:37.363 --> 55:40.196
It's the whole ball of wax.
The entire kit and caboodle.

55:40.466 --> 55:42.093
Why, without your good grammar,

55:42.301 --> 55:45.702
the whole darn shooting match
could go arse over tea kettle.

55:46.305 --> 55:49.763
Well, you can certainly turn a phrase.

55:50.142 --> 55:52.872
I can flip it up and rub it down too.

55:53.145 --> 55:57.946
Of course, that would be entirely
up to you, mum.

55:59.151 --> 56:00.880
Captain Sham...

56:01.687 --> 56:03.120
...at your service.

56:03.422 --> 56:06.289
He's lying. He's Count Olaf.

56:07.326 --> 56:10.659
That horrible man you warned me
about? Where? Who?

56:10.863 --> 56:12.490
- Right in front of you.
- Where's he at?

56:12.698 --> 56:14.131
- Behind Captain Sham?
- No.

56:14.333 --> 56:18.167
I'll show him a thing or two. I'll give
him the old "wax on, wax off," me son.

56:18.437 --> 56:20.132
Captain Sham is Count Olaf.

56:21.107 --> 56:23.302
I'm not going through this again.

56:23.509 --> 56:25.500
Children of the corn!

56:27.179 --> 56:28.476
Klaus!

56:28.681 --> 56:32.811
Why did you do this
to this poor man?

56:33.019 --> 56:35.852
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

56:36.789 --> 56:39.314
That's gonna smart in the morning.

56:39.792 --> 56:42.420
Oh, I don't pay that no
never mind, mum.

56:42.695 --> 56:46.324
He's just a boy barely
out of his OshKosh B'Gosh.

56:46.532 --> 56:48.090
I've had to deal with that sort of thing

56:48.300 --> 56:51.326
ever since me leg was chewed off
by the Lachrymose leeches.

56:51.804 --> 56:57.106
Why didn't I wait an hour before
swimming? Why? Why? Why?

56:58.244 --> 57:00.007
The leeches took my husband too.

57:00.212 --> 57:01.270
Get out of town.

57:01.480 --> 57:03.675
No, really.

57:03.883 --> 57:08.183
By jeez, them blasted leeches doomed
me to a life of hopping, they did.

57:08.888 --> 57:11.448
Sure, I get the good parking spots,

57:11.724 --> 57:15.683
but who could love a man with one leg
and a face like a hen's arse?

57:15.928 --> 57:19.227
I'm as lonely as a gull on a rock, girl.

57:19.532 --> 57:22.126
Oh, Captain Sham.

57:22.868 --> 57:26.463
Would you come to my house
for dinner this evening?

57:26.705 --> 57:27.729
- No!
- No!

57:28.007 --> 57:29.668
Oh, no, I don't know about that, mum.

57:29.875 --> 57:33.402
I'm afeard I might scuff up the floors
with this old cribbage peg.

57:33.612 --> 57:36.080
Well, I will lay down newspapers.

57:36.382 --> 57:40.341
Please, the children are going to make
a lovely dinner of puttanesca.

57:40.619 --> 57:44.578
The very meal I ate
before they took me leg!

57:45.024 --> 57:49.085
Oh, my goodness. Well, children,
I'm going to take Captain Sham home.

57:49.395 --> 57:53.764
And you stay here and shop for
an entirely puttanesca-free dinner.

57:54.800 --> 57:57.769
- But--
- "But" is not a sentence, Klaus.

57:59.638 --> 58:00.832
Aunt Josephine.

58:01.040 --> 58:03.668
Hey, you haven't paid for that.

58:10.249 --> 58:12.410
Kids today.

58:35.808 --> 58:37.537
Aunt Josephine?

58:43.349 --> 58:45.044
Aunt Josephine?

58:47.920 --> 58:49.319
Are you here?

58:49.788 --> 58:51.153
Aunt Jo?

58:52.258 --> 58:53.657
Are you here?

58:54.426 --> 58:56.121
Aunt Josephine?

59:01.967 --> 59:03.400
Oh, no.

59:03.602 --> 59:05.297
No.

59:11.443 --> 59:12.842
We're too late.

59:15.447 --> 59:17.244
We're too late.

59:23.455 --> 59:24.854
What does it say?

59:25.224 --> 59:26.919
It's a suicide note.

59:29.061 --> 59:33.020
"Violet, Klaus and Sunny, by the time
you read this, my life will be at its end.

59:33.232 --> 59:36.690
My heart is as cold as lke,
and I find life inbearable."

59:37.002 --> 59:38.196
"Inbearable"?

59:38.437 --> 59:39.699
Go on.

59:40.239 --> 59:43.572
"I know you children may not
understand the sad life of a dowadg--"

59:44.009 --> 59:45.374
"Dowager" has one D.

59:45.578 --> 59:47.375
It doesn't matter. Keep going.

59:48.614 --> 59:53.881
"--or what would have led to this
desperate akt." "Act" is spelled with a C.

59:54.119 --> 59:55.984
It's a suicide note.
Why are you checking spelling?

59:56.188 --> 59:58.088
She said her greatest joy in life
was grammar.

59:58.290 --> 59:59.655
Why is she making
all these mistakes?

01:00:01.026 --> 01:00:02.516
If you were about to jump
out a window,

01:00:02.728 --> 01:00:04.696
you might make
a few spelling mistakes too.

01:00:05.064 --> 01:00:06.759
"Please know that
I am much happier this way.

01:00:06.966 --> 01:00:09.867
As my last will and testament, I leave
you three in the care of Captain Sham,

01:00:10.135 --> 01:00:12.194
a kind and honorable man."

01:00:13.906 --> 01:00:16.466
That was his plan.
He made her write this note,

01:00:16.675 --> 01:00:18.404
and then he pushed her
out the window.

01:00:24.383 --> 01:00:27.784
No. It's not a suicide note.
It's a message.

01:00:28.254 --> 01:00:31.189
It's not supposed to be "lke,"
it's supposed to be "ice." C.

01:00:32.891 --> 01:00:34.688
And "unbearable" with a U.

01:00:53.312 --> 01:00:55.872
All the way over to Curdled Cave,
way over there.

01:00:56.081 --> 01:00:58.515
She's not dead. She's hiding.

01:00:59.051 --> 01:01:00.416
Curdled Cave?

01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:05.721
Sunny!

01:01:27.012 --> 01:01:28.809
He was investigating fires.

01:01:40.359 --> 01:01:42.486
Klaus, we gotta go.

01:01:57.443 --> 01:01:58.569
Come away from the fridge.

01:01:59.011 --> 01:02:00.137
What?

01:02:00.612 --> 01:02:03.137
If it falls, it could crush you flat.

01:02:44.356 --> 01:02:45.323
No way.

01:02:56.368 --> 01:02:57.835
Is it over?

01:03:04.610 --> 01:03:07.579
Violet, you better tie your hair up.

01:03:28.033 --> 01:03:30.661
Violet, ideas?

01:03:50.122 --> 01:03:51.589
Bring me that fire extinguisher.

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:53.258
Why?

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:55.957
Because we need to move
this anchor over there.

01:03:56.228 --> 01:03:58.856
- What?
- Just help me.

01:04:13.779 --> 01:04:15.406
On three, we're gonna
break that beam.

01:04:15.614 --> 01:04:16.911
- Break it?
- Yes.

01:04:17.115 --> 01:04:19.709
- That's the only thing keeping us up.
- Exactly.

01:04:19.952 --> 01:04:21.647
Are you sure you tied your hair
tight enough?

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:23.319
On three.

01:04:24.823 --> 01:04:26.051
One.

01:04:26.792 --> 01:04:28.054
Two.

01:04:28.994 --> 01:04:30.052
Three.

01:04:40.138 --> 01:04:41.162
Wait.

01:04:41.473 --> 01:04:42.667
Wait.

01:04:43.141 --> 01:04:45.268
Wait. Hold on, Sunny.

01:04:45.477 --> 01:04:46.637
Now!

01:05:02.294 --> 01:05:03.659
What do we do now?

01:05:03.862 --> 01:05:06.422
She's alive. We have to go
to the authorities.

01:05:06.798 --> 01:05:08.163
- No.
- What?

01:05:08.467 --> 01:05:10.765
- They won't listen. They never listen.
- Violet!

01:05:10.969 --> 01:05:14.427
It's Olaf. He'll never stop.
We have to find her ourselves.

01:05:16.675 --> 01:05:18.165
Hey, you kids.

01:05:18.477 --> 01:05:21.844
It's Captain Sham,
your new guardian.

01:05:22.147 --> 01:05:25.844
You just stay where you're at,
and we'll come where you're to.

01:05:26.151 --> 01:05:28.278
Ever read any books on sailing?

01:05:30.989 --> 01:05:36.291
<i>Klaus had read exactly 15 books on</i>
<i>sailing and two books on meteorology.</i>

01:05:36.862 --> 01:05:39.626
<i>But it is one thing to do something</i>
<i>in theory,</i>

01:05:39.831 --> 01:05:42.061
<i>another to do it in practice.</i>

01:05:42.334 --> 01:05:45.861
<i>Little could have prepared them</i>
<i>for the crossing to Curdled Cave</i>

01:05:46.071 --> 01:05:49.973
<i>at the hands of an angry</i>
<i>and ill-humored lake.</i>

01:05:50.175 --> 01:05:53.633
<i>But as the storm passed</i>
<i>and the waters calmed,</i>

01:05:53.845 --> 01:05:57.838
<i>the Baudelaires couldn't help but feel</i>
<i>a small sense of accomplishment.</i>

01:05:58.050 --> 01:06:01.747
<i>A rare moment of joy</i>
<i>in their otherwise woeful lives.</i>

01:06:03.121 --> 01:06:04.588
<i>They had made it.</i>

01:06:04.790 --> 01:06:07.224
<i>And if their guardian</i>
<i>could not rescue them,</i>

01:06:07.426 --> 01:06:10.987
<i>then they would rescue</i>
<i>their guardian.</i>

01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:23.232
Aunt Josephine?

01:06:38.724 --> 01:06:40.191
Aunt Josephine?

01:06:56.575 --> 01:06:58.202
Aunt Josephine?

01:07:01.313 --> 01:07:02.871
Are you in here?

01:07:14.593 --> 01:07:16.060
Aunt Josephine!

01:07:18.964 --> 01:07:20.397
Oh, children.

01:07:20.599 --> 01:07:25.502
You did it! You deciphered
the clues in my note.

01:07:25.704 --> 01:07:27.103
We're so glad you're okay.

01:07:27.305 --> 01:07:28.431
It was so horrible.

01:07:28.640 --> 01:07:31.074
Count Olaf forced me
to write that will,

01:07:31.276 --> 01:07:34.507
and then it nearly killed me to add in
all those grammatical errors.

01:07:36.481 --> 01:07:38.176
So did you bring groceries?

01:07:38.383 --> 01:07:41.250
Groceries?
We just came through a storm.

01:07:41.453 --> 01:07:44.354
Well, so? How do you expect us
to live in this cave

01:07:44.556 --> 01:07:46.421
if you didn't bring any food?

01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:47.819
Live in the cave?

01:07:48.026 --> 01:07:50.153
No, no, no. Aunt Josephine,
you have to come back with us.

01:07:50.362 --> 01:07:53.297
You willed us to Captain Sham.
You're the only proof we have it's a lie.

01:07:53.498 --> 01:07:56.262
No, no, no, no. No, no, it's much too
dangerous, children. I'm very sorry.

01:07:56.468 --> 01:07:59.767
Too dangerous? You're our guardian.
You're supposed to take care of us.

01:07:59.971 --> 01:08:01.768
I'm not gonna talk about it anymore.

01:08:03.575 --> 01:08:07.102
You know, Aunt Josephine,
Curdled Cave is for sale.

01:08:07.312 --> 01:08:08.438
So?

01:08:08.914 --> 01:08:13.817
So before too long, people
are gonna come to look at it.

01:08:14.186 --> 01:08:17.849
And some of those people
will be realtors.

01:08:43.014 --> 01:08:44.572
Aunt Josephine,

01:08:45.617 --> 01:08:47.209
what does this mean?

01:08:48.220 --> 01:08:49.585
Where did you find that?

01:08:49.787 --> 01:08:51.312
I found it in lke's room.

01:08:51.756 --> 01:08:53.314
The fires.

01:08:53.692 --> 01:08:55.683
Why was he investigating fires?

01:08:55.894 --> 01:09:00.854
We all were. Uncle Monty, lke and...

01:09:02.367 --> 01:09:03.732
Our parents.

01:09:04.803 --> 01:09:07.100
They were our leaders.

01:09:08.305 --> 01:09:09.500
Children,

01:09:10.207 --> 01:09:14.770
there are good people
and bad people in the world.

01:09:14.979 --> 01:09:18.676
The ones who start the fires
and the ones who put them out.

01:09:18.884 --> 01:09:20.078
Who's doing this?

01:09:20.285 --> 01:09:21.343
Is it Olaf?

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.916
I've said too much already.
Your parents knew the answer to that,

01:09:25.122 --> 01:09:26.350
and look what happened to them.

01:09:27.058 --> 01:09:30.515
Our parents? What did they say?

01:09:32.063 --> 01:09:34.054
We should never have left that cave.

01:09:34.265 --> 01:09:35.858
It's not too late for us
to turn around now,

01:09:36.067 --> 01:09:37.863
and I'll just take my chances
with the realtors.

01:09:38.069 --> 01:09:39.058
Aunt Josephine,

01:09:39.404 --> 01:09:41.964
what did our parents say?

01:09:43.241 --> 01:09:44.868
We're going to die.

01:09:46.444 --> 01:09:49.880
- What?
- It's the leeches!

01:09:56.521 --> 01:09:59.820
I guess it's a good thing none of us
have eaten in a while then.

01:10:09.434 --> 01:10:10.799
Aunt Josephine!

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:30.918
There's a crack in the boat!

01:10:33.058 --> 01:10:36.824
Klaus, what do we do?
They're eating the boat!

01:10:37.462 --> 01:10:39.589
We're sinking, sinking, sinking.

01:10:39.798 --> 01:10:42.926
- Klaus, paddle, please.
- Doomed. Doomed.

01:10:43.134 --> 01:10:45.762
Aunt Josephine, that is not helping.

01:10:51.643 --> 01:10:55.101
There's a boat.
Over here! Over here!

01:10:55.313 --> 01:10:58.544
<i>But as unpleasant</i>
<i>as Lachrymose leeches can be,</i>

01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:02.948
<i>there was something far more</i>
<i>unpleasant arriving out of the fog.</i>

01:11:03.154 --> 01:11:07.056
Hello, hello, hello.

01:11:08.193 --> 01:11:11.458
I missed you guys.

01:11:11.663 --> 01:11:15.497
Looks like you could use
a little assistance.

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.998
You're gonna need assistance
when we get back to town.

01:11:18.203 --> 01:11:20.398
Aunt Josephine's gonna tell everyone
what happened.

01:11:20.605 --> 01:11:22.129
Then I'll be arrested and sent to jail,

01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:24.570
and you'll live happily ever after
with a friendly guardian,

01:11:24.776 --> 01:11:26.801
spending your time inventing things
and reading books

01:11:27.012 --> 01:11:28.479
and sharpening
your little monkey teeth.

01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:30.705
And bravery and nobility
will prevail at last.

01:11:30.916 --> 01:11:32.975
And this wicked world
will slowly but surely become

01:11:33.184 --> 01:11:34.310
a place of cheerful harmony.

01:11:34.519 --> 01:11:36.544
And everyone will be singing
and dancing and giggling

01:11:36.755 --> 01:11:38.052
like the Littlest Elf.

01:11:38.256 --> 01:11:41.748
A happy ending.
Is that what you had in mind?

01:11:42.093 --> 01:11:46.154
Because I hardly think that anybody
is going to believe a dead woman.

01:11:46.498 --> 01:11:47.863
You're not gonna touch
Aunt Josephine.

01:11:48.066 --> 01:11:49.363
She'll tell everyone what happened.

01:11:49.567 --> 01:11:52.035
No, no, no, no, I won't tell anybody
anything. I promise.

01:11:52.237 --> 01:11:53.898
Please don't throw me
to the leeches.

01:11:54.139 --> 01:11:56.539
You can have the fortune.
You can have the children.

01:11:56.741 --> 01:11:58.231
Aunt Josephine!

01:11:58.443 --> 01:11:59.569
Please.

01:11:59.778 --> 01:12:02.576
Welcome aboard. Hot potato.

01:12:04.482 --> 01:12:07.417
I'll go away. I'll dye my hair.
I'll change my name.

01:12:07.652 --> 01:12:11.179
- But what about us?
- Quiet, child. The adults are talking.

01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:16.560
- I suppose I don't have to kill you.
- No.

01:12:16.761 --> 01:12:19.195
On the other hand, with that little stunt
of yours at the window,

01:12:19.397 --> 01:12:22.764
you hadn't been
a very trustworthy person.

01:12:23.468 --> 01:12:24.765
But...

01:12:26.571 --> 01:12:28.630
...I could show a little mercy.

01:12:30.976 --> 01:12:32.910
"Haven't."

01:12:36.948 --> 01:12:38.074
What?

01:12:38.917 --> 01:12:42.546
You said "hadn't." That's bad grammar.
You should've said,

01:12:42.754 --> 01:12:45.552
"You haven't been
a very trustworthy person."

01:12:49.260 --> 01:12:52.718
Thank you for correcting me.

01:12:53.298 --> 01:12:54.560
Not at all.

01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:58.564
No. No, no, no, no, no.
Aunt Josephine. Aunt Josephine!

01:12:58.770 --> 01:12:59.964
- Aunt Josephine.
- You can't--

01:13:00.171 --> 01:13:02.332
- Aunt Josephine. Aunt--
- Aunt Josephine. Jump!

01:13:03.475 --> 01:13:05.602
<i>Well, you get the picture.</i>

01:13:09.981 --> 01:13:11.573
Aunt Josephine.

01:13:12.283 --> 01:13:16.515
Well, we've done all we can do.

01:13:18.957 --> 01:13:20.288
Everybody be cool.

01:13:20.725 --> 01:13:23.125
Children? Is that you?

01:13:23.328 --> 01:13:24.625
Mr. Poe! We're--

01:13:24.829 --> 01:13:26.091
Drowning.

01:13:28.967 --> 01:13:32.368
I saved him! I saved the boy
from the leeches!

01:13:32.570 --> 01:13:35.095
Back to the depths,
you fingery devils.

01:13:35.306 --> 01:13:38.366
You will not devour
this boy's head today.

01:13:42.881 --> 01:13:45.543
Count Olaf?
What are you doing here?

01:13:45.750 --> 01:13:50.278
Mr. Poe, please. Count Olaf,
what are you doing here, man?

01:13:50.588 --> 01:13:53.148
I know, I know. I shouldn't have come.

01:13:53.358 --> 01:13:56.794
But when I heard the children
were in danger, I had to.

01:13:57.195 --> 01:13:59.288
Even if I'm not...

01:13:59.664 --> 01:14:01.655
...fit to be their guardian.

01:14:03.601 --> 01:14:05.796
It appears I was wrong about you,
Count Olaf.

01:14:06.004 --> 01:14:08.063
- No!
- No.

01:14:08.273 --> 01:14:11.834
You have proven yourself to be
an exceptionally capable guardian.

01:14:12.243 --> 01:14:13.835
And I would be remiss
in my responsibility

01:14:14.045 --> 01:14:16.741
if I did not place the children
with you immediately.

01:14:17.415 --> 01:14:19.645
- Why, if it weren't for you, the--
- Don't say it!

01:14:19.851 --> 01:14:23.014
I can't stand the thought
of losing my little treasures.

01:14:23.221 --> 01:14:25.416
Even the thought
of the massive inheritance

01:14:25.623 --> 01:14:28.490
would be a constant reminder
of my heartache.

01:14:28.693 --> 01:14:30.718
Well, well, there's no need
to fret about that.

01:14:30.929 --> 01:14:34.365
The law clearly states that you
would not inherit the Baudelaire fortune

01:14:34.566 --> 01:14:35.999
if anything happened to the children.

01:14:36.367 --> 01:14:37.334
Say what?

01:14:37.535 --> 01:14:42.097
No, no. With the exception, of course,
of blood relatives and married couples.

01:14:42.807 --> 01:14:43.933
Really?

01:14:53.251 --> 01:14:54.718
Mr. Poe,

01:14:55.320 --> 01:14:58.949
have I told you about our new play?

01:15:09.734 --> 01:15:11.201
Critic.

01:15:11.903 --> 01:15:13.370
Critic!

01:15:15.006 --> 01:15:16.030
Cape, sir.

01:15:16.241 --> 01:15:18.038
Don't try to get on my good side.

01:15:21.479 --> 01:15:23.879
What is he up to?
Why are we in the play?

01:15:24.082 --> 01:15:27.950
He's using this as a prop.
It says that if two people are married,

01:15:28.153 --> 01:15:31.213
they're entitled to any money
that either of them has.

01:15:31.422 --> 01:15:34.823
No, but it's just a play. He can't get
our fortune by marrying me in a play.

01:15:36.261 --> 01:15:37.626
Can't I?

01:15:37.829 --> 01:15:41.925
Conspirators. "Caesar must die.
Caesar must die. Caesar must die."

01:15:42.133 --> 01:15:43.361
In order to be a valid marriage,

01:15:43.568 --> 01:15:46.298
it has to be administered
by a bona fide justice of the peace.

01:15:46.504 --> 01:15:47.664
It says so right here.

01:15:47.872 --> 01:15:52.104
Justice Strauss, are you ready
for your debut?

01:15:53.945 --> 01:15:58.678
Look at you.
Violet, you look so beautiful.

01:15:59.050 --> 01:16:02.281
You are the bride, I'm the judge.
Who's the groom?

01:16:02.487 --> 01:16:05.115
No, Justice Strauss, you don't
understand. The play is real.

01:16:05.323 --> 01:16:07.257
Yes! Yes.

01:16:07.458 --> 01:16:11.019
It must be real. That's why I cast you.

01:16:11.229 --> 01:16:14.096
All the other actors I saw
lacked the proper--

01:16:14.299 --> 01:16:15.732
What's the word I'm looking for?

01:16:15.934 --> 01:16:17.697
- Hair?
- Hands?

01:16:17.969 --> 01:16:19.869
Verisimilitude.

01:16:20.572 --> 01:16:21.869
Now, remember, Justice Strauss,

01:16:22.073 --> 01:16:24.837
you must say the words exactly
as you would in a real wedding.

01:16:25.043 --> 01:16:27.841
Get it absolutely right. There are
talent scouts in the audience

01:16:28.046 --> 01:16:31.379
looking for someone your age.
It's all riding on this one.

01:16:32.116 --> 01:16:35.210
Why did you have to tell me that?
Oh, my God.

01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:36.648
Take her to makeup.

01:16:36.854 --> 01:16:40.051
Enjoy! Embrace the butterflies.

01:16:40.258 --> 01:16:44.285
This is ridiculous. Violet's only 14.
She can't be legally married.

01:16:44.495 --> 01:16:46.360
She can if she has the permission
of her guardian.

01:16:46.564 --> 01:16:49.397
And who's that? Oh, yes. Me!

01:16:52.103 --> 01:16:53.661
Look it up, bookworm.

01:16:53.871 --> 01:16:56.635
Yes. Once you say "I do"
and sign the marriage certificate,

01:16:56.841 --> 01:16:59.332
you'll really be my loverly bride.

01:16:59.544 --> 01:17:02.707
You'll cook and clean
and massage my bunions

01:17:02.914 --> 01:17:05.405
and clip my thick, yellow toenails.

01:17:05.617 --> 01:17:10.054
Hey, marriage is no picnic.
You gotta work at it.

01:17:10.288 --> 01:17:12.654
I'll never say "I do." Never.

01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:15.820
I think you might...

01:17:16.761 --> 01:17:19.059
...once you look up there.

01:17:27.572 --> 01:17:28.664
Let her go!

01:17:29.207 --> 01:17:30.834
Gladly. Let her go.

01:17:31.743 --> 01:17:33.506
- No!
- Put a hold on that.

01:17:34.979 --> 01:17:36.947
If you don't say "I do,"

01:17:37.148 --> 01:17:40.174
or if anything should happen
to interrupt this performance,

01:17:40.985 --> 01:17:42.543
I say one word into this,

01:17:42.754 --> 01:17:47.123
and down will come baby,
cradle and all.

01:17:47.792 --> 01:17:49.020
Clang!

01:17:49.994 --> 01:17:52.189
How could you? She's an infant.

01:17:52.397 --> 01:17:55.662
Oh, Violet. Violet, Violet, Violet.

01:17:56.567 --> 01:17:59.035
Violet.

01:17:59.237 --> 01:18:00.932
You're 14 years old.

01:18:01.139 --> 01:18:04.870
You should know by now that you
can't have everything you want.

01:18:05.176 --> 01:18:08.703
You want a life of happiness?
A roof over your head?

01:18:08.913 --> 01:18:11.905
A place to call your own
and all that jazz?

01:18:14.786 --> 01:18:16.913
And what about what I want?

01:18:17.655 --> 01:18:20.715
I want that enormous fortune

01:18:20.925 --> 01:18:24.884
and for all investigations
against me to cease.

01:18:25.763 --> 01:18:30.063
You're going to help me
get what I want...

01:18:30.968 --> 01:18:32.458
...tonight.

01:18:41.612 --> 01:18:43.477
My public awaits.

01:18:51.489 --> 01:18:54.481
Ladies and gentlemen, could you
put your appendages together

01:18:54.692 --> 01:18:57.286
for <i>The Marvelouse Marriage</i>.

01:18:57.495 --> 01:18:59.929
No. You're not gonna
go through with this.

01:19:03.301 --> 01:19:04.768
I have to.

01:19:05.169 --> 01:19:08.297
No, come on.
There's always something.

01:19:08.506 --> 01:19:10.269
There's always something.

01:19:11.843 --> 01:19:13.538
No, not this time.

01:19:15.046 --> 01:19:16.013
But...

01:19:16.214 --> 01:19:17.875
Camel, you're on.

01:19:20.318 --> 01:19:22.309
- Go, Klaus.
- Violet.

01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.544
Go!

01:19:24.689 --> 01:19:26.850
Move your hump, camel. You're on.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:37.991
<i>Nothing in the world will keep</i>
<i>The count from his beloved bride</i>

01:19:38.202 --> 01:19:40.796
<i>Nothing in the world will keep</i>
<i>The count from his beloved bride</i>

01:19:41.005 --> 01:19:43.064
<i>Nothing in the world</i>
<i>Nothing in the world</i>

01:19:43.274 --> 01:19:45.538
<i>Nothing</i>
<i>Nothing</i>

01:19:50.248 --> 01:19:54.150
What a marvelous day
for a marriage.

01:19:54.352 --> 01:19:59.654
If only the handsome count
were here to claim his bride.

01:19:59.857 --> 01:20:03.816
With his full head of hair
and great bravery,

01:20:04.028 --> 01:20:06.997
the count has no equal.

01:20:09.100 --> 01:20:10.499
What would Violet do?

01:20:10.701 --> 01:20:14.432
The courageous battle
has waylaid him.

01:20:14.639 --> 01:20:18.370
There's always something.
There's always something.

01:20:18.576 --> 01:20:21.340
And a quiet, bald-headed suitor

01:20:21.546 --> 01:20:24.174
has stolen the bride's affections.

01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:28.243
Alas. The groom is a cad.

01:20:28.453 --> 01:20:31.854
And nowhere near as handsome
as the count.

01:20:32.156 --> 01:20:35.057
If only for a miracle.

01:20:35.259 --> 01:20:39.559
Some way for the handsome count
to come and save...

01:20:43.835 --> 01:20:47.202
What a thoroughly unmarvelous
marriage this will be.

01:20:47.405 --> 01:20:48.929
But wait.

01:20:49.574 --> 01:20:52.236
What is that?

01:20:57.014 --> 01:21:01.417
It's the count, in his autogiro.

01:21:01.619 --> 01:21:03.712
I didn't know they had
this kind of budget.

01:21:14.499 --> 01:21:19.664
Yes, it is I, come to marry my bride.

01:21:20.171 --> 01:21:24.904
And you, sir, have been taken
by surprise.

01:21:25.443 --> 01:21:28.742
Caution. This next scene could get
pretty graphic.

01:21:28.946 --> 01:21:30.311
Away, rapscallion!

01:21:34.285 --> 01:21:35.582
Hairless Lothario!

01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:38.418
Take that. And that.

01:21:40.124 --> 01:21:41.785
Can I get some slack?

01:21:44.128 --> 01:21:46.255
Let the wedding begin.

01:22:13.824 --> 01:22:15.121
Don't look down.

01:22:16.327 --> 01:22:17.726
Don't look down.

01:22:30.775 --> 01:22:33.573
Do you, Count Olaf,

01:22:33.778 --> 01:22:37.976
take this to be
your lawfully wedded wife,

01:22:38.182 --> 01:22:42.346
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

01:22:42.954 --> 01:22:44.319
Until death,

01:22:45.456 --> 01:22:47.583
I most certainly do.

01:22:51.028 --> 01:22:53.155
Do you, Violet Baudelaire,

01:22:53.364 --> 01:22:57.061
take this--? Count Olaf

01:22:57.268 --> 01:23:00.396
to be your lawfully wedded husband,

01:23:00.605 --> 01:23:04.666
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

01:23:04.875 --> 01:23:06.502
Justice Strauss, l--

01:23:12.883 --> 01:23:14.077
I do.

01:23:14.719 --> 01:23:16.619
- She doesn't deserve him.
- No.

01:23:16.821 --> 01:23:19.517
- Are you thinking that?
- No, she doesn't.

01:23:19.957 --> 01:23:21.857
- Now, all that is left...
- Sunny?

01:23:22.059 --> 01:23:25.290
...is for this happy couple to sign
the marriage certificate,

01:23:25.496 --> 01:23:27.225
and this union shall be--

01:23:27.431 --> 01:23:28.864
Official

01:23:29.567 --> 01:23:30.693
and legal.

01:23:54.825 --> 01:23:58.056
Sunny, where's the key?
The key to the lock.

01:24:23.454 --> 01:24:25.752
Right hand, please.

01:25:30.054 --> 01:25:32.488
<i>Children, I'm afraid</i>
<i>I must inform you</i>

01:25:32.690 --> 01:25:36.353
<i>of an extremely unfortunate event.</i>

01:25:37.595 --> 01:25:40.587
<i>I'm very, very sorry to tell you this,</i>
<i>but your parents have perished in a fire</i>

01:25:40.798 --> 01:25:42.663
<i>that's destroyed your entire home.</i>

01:25:43.601 --> 01:25:45.694
These things don't just happen.

01:25:49.473 --> 01:25:51.065
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

01:25:55.446 --> 01:25:57.937
Look what I did
to your pretty little home.

01:25:59.617 --> 01:26:00.777
Let's finish here.

01:26:09.693 --> 01:26:10.751
<i>Boss.</i>

01:26:11.061 --> 01:26:13.154
What is it? Kind of busy right now.

01:26:13.364 --> 01:26:14.490
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

01:26:14.698 --> 01:26:15.858
Where are you?

01:26:16.066 --> 01:26:17.863
<i>Look up.</i>

01:26:22.173 --> 01:26:23.140
Hi!

01:26:27.011 --> 01:26:28.672
And so concludes our play!

01:26:28.879 --> 01:26:30.506
No, wait, it wasn't a play!

01:26:30.714 --> 01:26:33.478
Count Olaf was gonna kill Sunny
if I didn't go through with the marriage.

01:26:33.684 --> 01:26:34.651
Ridiculous.

01:26:35.586 --> 01:26:37.019
No, you have to listen to me.

01:26:37.221 --> 01:26:40.190
He was only marrying me to get
to the Baudelaire fortune.

01:26:40.391 --> 01:26:42.018
No, that part is true, actually.

01:26:42.226 --> 01:26:43.193
What?

01:26:43.394 --> 01:26:46.795
Violet and I are indeed
a blissfully wedded couple,

01:26:47.031 --> 01:26:48.191
because, you see,

01:26:49.333 --> 01:26:51.801
we were married
in an official ceremony,

01:26:52.002 --> 01:26:53.970
with official and legal vows

01:26:54.171 --> 01:26:58.369
in front of a bona fide
justice of the peace.

01:26:58.742 --> 01:27:00.539
Oh, my God, what have I done?

01:27:00.911 --> 01:27:02.845
I'm sorry! I didn't know!

01:27:03.047 --> 01:27:04.742
First order of business,

01:27:04.949 --> 01:27:08.316
put the other two brats
up for adoption, separately,

01:27:08.519 --> 01:27:10.680
into the far corners of the earth.

01:27:10.888 --> 01:27:14.187
These children are meddlesome
when they're together.

01:27:14.391 --> 01:27:20.193
- Mr. Poe!
- You unspeakable cad! Arrest him!

01:27:21.232 --> 01:27:22.324
For what?

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.999
For being a greedy monster!

01:27:24.201 --> 01:27:25.225
Come on.

01:27:26.537 --> 01:27:30.337
Oh, I'm the monster? I'm the monster?

01:27:31.375 --> 01:27:33.741
You're the monster.

01:27:34.144 --> 01:27:36.442
Come on. Come on.

01:27:36.647 --> 01:27:40.276
These children tried to tell you,
but you wouldn't listen.

01:27:40.484 --> 01:27:43.214
No one ever listens to children.

01:27:43.888 --> 01:27:46.254
- Come on.
- Do you think you're innocent?

01:27:46.457 --> 01:27:48.015
You're accomplices.

01:27:48.559 --> 01:27:52.359
This certificate says
that I have the fortune now.

01:27:52.763 --> 01:27:53.855
Come on!

01:27:54.064 --> 01:27:56.624
And there's nothing you can do
about it!

01:28:02.439 --> 01:28:05.772
What do you think? Too diabolical?
Give me some feedback.

01:28:21.191 --> 01:28:24.058
Hey, marriage is no picnic.

01:28:24.261 --> 01:28:27.492
Oh, and by the way,
you're a terrible actor.

01:28:28.032 --> 01:28:29.158
Now, now,

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.031
let's keep our heads here.

01:28:32.336 --> 01:28:35.965
If you do anything to me,
you're just sinking to my level.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:40.233
Not to mention setting
a terrible example for the children.

01:28:41.478 --> 01:28:42.502
Guilty.

01:28:42.713 --> 01:28:46.274
<i>I am thrilled to say that Count Olaf</i>
<i>was captured,</i>

01:28:46.483 --> 01:28:49.179
<i>for crimes too numerous to mention.</i>

01:28:49.386 --> 01:28:52.947
<i>And before serving his life sentence,</i>
<i>it was the judge's decree</i>

01:28:53.157 --> 01:28:55.682
<i>that Olaf be made to suffer</i>
<i>every hardship</i>

01:28:55.893 --> 01:28:57.827
- <i>that he forced upon the children.</i>
- Yes!

01:29:00.864 --> 01:29:03.162
Get out! Get out!

01:29:07.404 --> 01:29:08.871
Oh, no.

01:29:18.015 --> 01:29:20.483
<i>The Baudelaires had triumphed.</i>

01:29:20.684 --> 01:29:24.882
<i>A word which here means, "unmasking</i>
<i>a cruel and talentless arsonist</i>

01:29:25.089 --> 01:29:28.081
<i>and solving the mystery</i>
<i>of the Baudelaire fire. "</i>

01:29:30.894 --> 01:29:33.158
<i>If only justice were as kind.</i>

01:29:33.364 --> 01:29:38.666
<i>Count Olaf vanished after a jury</i>
<i>of his peers overturned his sentence.</i>

01:29:39.236 --> 01:29:42.933
<i>As for the Baudelaires, what lay</i>
<i>ahead for them was unclear.</i>

01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.607
<i>But one thing they knew,</i>
<i>as they climbed</i>

01:29:44.808 --> 01:29:47.868
<i>once again into the back</i>
<i>of Mr. Poe's car:</i>

01:29:48.579 --> 01:29:50.046
<i>They were moving on.</i>

01:29:52.649 --> 01:29:54.412
Now, don't worry, children,

01:29:54.885 --> 01:29:58.013
I'm sure the authorities will catch up
with Count Olaf very soon.

01:29:59.223 --> 01:30:02.920
No, no, we'll never have to deal
with that terrible man again.

01:30:06.730 --> 01:30:08.220
Before we leave,

01:30:09.666 --> 01:30:13.693
perhaps there's time
for just one last stop.

01:31:59.743 --> 01:32:02.837
"Violet, Klaus and Sunny."
It's addressed to us.

01:32:03.046 --> 01:32:04.809
Look at all these postmarks.

01:32:05.182 --> 01:32:10.142
It's been to England and Rome
and Kenya and Iceland.

01:32:10.387 --> 01:32:12.218
I don't even know
where these are from.

01:32:12.422 --> 01:32:13.719
Who's it from?

01:32:20.297 --> 01:32:21.696
Mom and Dad.

01:32:36.813 --> 01:32:38.212
It's the letter.

01:32:39.183 --> 01:32:41.048
The letter that never came.

01:32:45.022 --> 01:32:47.650
"Dearest children,
since we've been abroad

01:32:47.858 --> 01:32:49.621
we have missed you all so much.

01:32:50.861 --> 01:32:54.160
Certain events have compelled us
to extend our travels.

01:32:54.965 --> 01:32:56.592
One day, when you're older,

01:32:57.100 --> 01:32:59.568
you will learn all about the people
we've befriended

01:32:59.770 --> 01:33:01.567
and the dangers we have faced.

01:33:02.272 --> 01:33:05.400
At times, the world can seem
an unfriendly and sinister place.

01:33:05.609 --> 01:33:09.306
But believe us when we say that there
is much more good in it than bad.

01:33:09.513 --> 01:33:11.743
All you have to do
is look hard enough.

01:33:12.449 --> 01:33:15.077
And what might seem to be
a series of unfortunate events

01:33:15.285 --> 01:33:17.913
may in fact be the first steps
of a journey.

01:33:18.889 --> 01:33:21.687
We hope to have you back
in our arms soon, darlings.

01:33:21.892 --> 01:33:26.022
But in case this letter arrives before
our return, know that we love you.

01:33:27.331 --> 01:33:30.198
It fills us with pride to know that
no matter what happens in this life

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:31.958
that you three will take care
of each other

01:33:32.169 --> 01:33:34.467
with kindness and bravery
and selflessness,

01:33:34.671 --> 01:33:36.434
as you always have.

01:33:36.974 --> 01:33:40.137
And remember one thing, my darlings,
and never forget it:

01:33:40.844 --> 01:33:44.644
That no matter where we are, know
that as long as you have each other,

01:33:44.848 --> 01:33:47.476
you have your family,
and you are home.

01:33:48.418 --> 01:33:50.113
Your loving parents."

01:34:08.905 --> 01:34:12.966
<i>Passing the torch is a rite of passage</i>
<i>that can take many forms.</i>

01:34:13.176 --> 01:34:16.907
<i>But perhaps the least known</i>
<i>and most surprising</i>

01:34:17.414 --> 01:34:19.644
<i>is the passing of a spyglass.</i>

01:34:38.335 --> 01:34:40.860
<i>Dear reader, there are people</i>
<i>in the world</i>

01:34:41.071 --> 01:34:43.835
<i>who know no misery and woe.</i>
<i>And they take comfort</i>

01:34:44.041 --> 01:34:46.271
<i>in cheerful films about twittering</i>
<i>birds and giggling elves.</i>

01:34:48.845 --> 01:34:52.178
<i>There are people who know that</i>
<i>there's always a mystery to be solved.</i>

01:34:52.382 --> 01:34:53.815
<i>And they take comfort in researching</i>

01:34:54.017 --> 01:34:57.316
<i>and writing down</i>
<i>any important evidence.</i>

01:34:59.356 --> 01:35:02.348
<i>But this story is not about</i>
<i>such people.</i>

01:35:02.592 --> 01:35:05.720
<i>This story is about the Baudelaires.</i>

01:35:06.029 --> 01:35:10.261
<i>And they are the sort of people who</i>
<i>know that there's always something.</i>

01:35:11.101 --> 01:35:14.332
<i>Something to invent,</i>
<i>something to read,</i>

01:35:14.538 --> 01:35:17.166
<i>something to bite</i>
<i>and something to do</i>

01:35:17.374 --> 01:35:20.707
<i>to make a sanctuary,</i>
<i>no matter how small.</i>

01:35:31.488 --> 01:35:34.685
<i>And for this reason,</i>
<i>I am happy to say,</i>

01:35:34.891 --> 01:35:39.851
<i>the Baudelaires were</i>
<i>very fortunate indeed.</i>

01:46:14.897 --> 01:46:18.424
<i>Oh, the captain loved</i>
<i>The ladies</i>

01:46:18.634 --> 01:46:21.000
<i>But he dragged himself</i>
<i>A wife</i>

01:46:21.204 --> 01:46:24.799
<i>Now he's wishin' he was fishin'</i>
<i>But he's on the hook for life</i>

01:46:25.008 --> 01:46:26.305
<i>Well, I guess he should not</i>
<i>Ought-er</i>

01:46:26.509 --> 01:46:28.739
<i>But he drowned her</i>
<i>In the water</i>

01:46:28.945 --> 01:46:30.640
<i>And then a flounder</i>
<i>Downed her</i>

01:46:30.847 --> 01:46:32.940
<i>That's why they never</i>
<i>Found her</i>

01:46:38.221 --> 01:46:41.554
<i>Bum buttery, flit fluttery</i>
<i>Dum diddly-ooh</i>

01:46:41.758 --> 01:46:45.057
<i>Bum buttery, bluebird</i>
<i>Is singing a tune</i>

01:46:45.261 --> 01:46:48.628
<i>Daffy-down-dillies awaken</i>
<i>And prune</i>

01:46:48.831 --> 01:46:51.629
<i>Bursting in bloom</i>
<i>All the flowers assume</i>

01:46:51.834 --> 01:46:55.634
<i>It's a loverly, loverly spring</i>

01:47:03.146 --> 01:47:06.445
<i>Chit-chattery chipmunks</i>
<i>All singing along</i>

01:47:06.649 --> 01:47:10.016
<i>Humming their</i>
<i>Join-in-a-spring-along song</i>

01:47:10.219 --> 01:47:13.052
<i>Spring is the springiest time</i>
<i>For a song</i>

01:47:13.256 --> 01:47:16.657
<i>It's a loverly, loverly spring</i>

01:47:16.859 --> 01:47:20.420
<i>In the forest we play</i>
<i>With the rabbits all day</i>

01:47:20.630 --> 01:47:23.997
<i>We visit the birdies</i>
<i>And fishes</i>

01:47:24.200 --> 01:47:27.601
<i>There's nary a care</i>
<i>When there's spring in the air</i>

01:47:27.804 --> 01:47:31.433
<i>The feeling is just</i>
<i>Too delicious</i>

01:47:31.641 --> 01:47:35.008
<i>Rum-buttery buttercups</i>
<i>All in a row</i>

01:47:35.211 --> 01:47:38.510
<i>Trilling and thrilling</i>
<i>And stealing the show</i>

01:47:38.714 --> 01:47:41.615
<i>May is the merriest month</i>
<i>That I know</i>

01:47:41.818 --> 01:47:44.252
<i>It's a loverly, loverly</i>

01:47:44.454 --> 01:47:45.716
<i>La-la-loverly</i>

01:47:45.922 --> 01:47:48.982
<i>La-la-la-loverly spring</i>
