1
00:02:08,542 --> 00:02:12,167
In 1974 B.E.,

2
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,625
in the reign of

3
00:02:14,792 --> 00:02:17,625
King Borommaracha Thirat II,

4
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:20,042
the Ayothaya royal court

5
00:02:20,167 --> 00:02:23,582
seized the territory of Sukhothai

6
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:28,125
and has expanded its power
across the highlands

7
00:02:28,417 --> 00:02:30,457
to the east.

8
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,250
After a seven-month siege,

9
00:02:34,457 --> 00:02:38,582
Ayothaya captured the divine city.

10
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,457
One year and three months later...

11
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,667
Take care of yourself, young master.

12
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,291
Shoot!

13
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,750
Get the boy.

14
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,666
Hey! Stop!

15
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,833
Go!

16
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:09,833
Go!

17
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:11,541
Go!

18
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,166
Go! Faster!

19
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,166
Faster!

20
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:24,291
Go!

21
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,250
Hurry up!

22
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,333
Faster!

23
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,041
Move!

24
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:33,083
Hey! Come down quickly!

25
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,708
Get down!

26
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,625
Hey!

27
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:41,333
Hey!

28
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:42,958
Let me go!

29
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,583
Let go!

30
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:50,916
Hey!

31
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,708
Let go!

32
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,750
Let go of me!

33
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,875
I said let me go!

34
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:04,041
This boy is the next one.

35
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:07,208
-Hey! Go!
-Let go of me!

36
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,291
Move!

37
00:09:08,542 --> 00:09:10,750
He's the next fighter.

38
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:20,582
Hey!

39
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:29,207
I will give you a chance, kid.

40
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:32,125
Let's see if you can make it out alive.

41
00:10:13,582 --> 00:10:14,625
Hey! Let's start.

42
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:16,832
Begin!

43
00:11:17,457 --> 00:11:18,332
Hey!

44
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,375
Your life

45
00:12:23,082 --> 00:12:24,832
depends on yourself, kid.

46
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,167
Tien.

47
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,917
I want to be a great warrior
like my father.

48
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:27,875
How long will you be away?

49
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:29,332
I hate you!

50
00:14:30,667 --> 00:14:32,457
Father!

51
00:15:20,207 --> 00:15:21,625
Is this the boy?

52
00:15:23,292 --> 00:15:24,625
That's right, Father Sengpa.

53
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:28,832
A light in his eyes

54
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:31,000
when he was fighting

55
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:34,125
reminded me of someone.

56
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,417
Even the spirits don't dare to touch him.

57
00:16:04,417 --> 00:16:05,625
He has a powerful destiny.

58
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:13,750
His hands.

59
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:16,207
Whenever he holds a weapon,

60
00:16:17,292 --> 00:16:19,375
he will be the best of the best.

61
00:16:24,082 --> 00:16:25,332
I'm Chernung.

62
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,082
I'm leader of
the Garuda Wing Cliff outlaws.

63
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:31,750
I am impressed

64
00:16:32,707 --> 00:16:35,832
by your brave and unyielding
fight with the crocodile.

65
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:39,042
If you want to train your weapon skills

66
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,042
and learn about martial arts at my camp,

67
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:44,125
I will allow you to.

68
00:16:46,457 --> 00:16:47,625
If you don't want to stay

69
00:16:48,707 --> 00:16:49,875
and will go elsewhere,

70
00:16:50,957 --> 00:16:52,125
I will not stop you.

71
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,000
Shoot!

72
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,208
Unite your body and soul.

73
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:58,208
Merge the rules of weapons.

74
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,583
Set your mind on the path of power.

75
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,041
That is what you need to practice.

76
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:17,708
Each weapon has its own
strength and weakness.

77
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:19,291
Long or short.

78
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:22,458
Sharp or blunt. Soft or hard.

79
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,000
Light or heavy.

80
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,125
A weapon

81
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:39,791
is a tangible form of power.

82
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,166
Anyone who can merge
his body and soul with it

83
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:47,250
will possess the greatest power.

84
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,916
The world and everyone in it

85
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,791
will yield to your power.

86
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:12,541
I, Chernung,

87
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,958
leader of the Garuda Wing Cliff outlaws

88
00:20:15,416 --> 00:20:17,708
have given you a new life.

89
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,375
From now on,

90
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,833
you will always remember

91
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:28,208
that you are one of
the Garuda Wing Cliff outlaws.

92
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,041
In the test of

93
00:24:13,166 --> 00:24:15,458
agility and cleverness,

94
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:17,875
Tien passes.

95
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,000
The next challenge

96
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:23,416
is the test of

97
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:24,958
fighting.

98
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:39,500
Yes!

99
00:30:40,583 --> 00:30:42,875
That's what I'm talking about, my son!

100
00:30:54,625 --> 00:30:56,083
This place

101
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:59,125
will test the power of your mind.

102
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:06,041
Help me!

103
00:31:08,833 --> 00:31:09,833
Let me go!

104
00:31:13,208 --> 00:31:14,500
Help me!

105
00:31:20,708 --> 00:31:21,875
Help me!

106
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,125
Help me!

107
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:38,041
Don't be afraid of me.

108
00:31:39,208 --> 00:31:40,291
Don't be afraid.

109
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,000
I will set you free.

110
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:43,875
Come with me.

111
00:31:46,375 --> 00:31:47,666
I will help you.

112
00:31:48,666 --> 00:31:49,791
Don't be afraid.

113
00:31:51,125 --> 00:31:52,000
Don't be afraid.

114
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,875
Your life

115
00:33:13,666 --> 00:33:15,416
depends on yourself.

116
00:33:42,875 --> 00:33:43,833
Killing

117
00:33:44,708 --> 00:33:46,291
and being merciless

118
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:48,541
are the last things

119
00:33:49,541 --> 00:33:51,166
a leader must learn.

120
00:33:59,125 --> 00:34:01,666
My people, my children!

121
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,500
Now,

122
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,500
the deity from heaven

123
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,208
has sent this black-tusk elephant

124
00:34:12,666 --> 00:34:13,750
as a sign of blessing

125
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:16,583
and auspicious glory

126
00:34:16,916 --> 00:34:18,416
of the king of elephants.

127
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,208
This magic animal

128
00:34:22,333 --> 00:34:25,041
will bring prosperity

129
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:28,291
to our community.

130
00:34:28,916 --> 00:34:32,291
Yeah!

131
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:37,583
Now,

132
00:34:38,833 --> 00:34:40,125
I, Chernung,

133
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,041
hereby proclaim that

134
00:34:43,416 --> 00:34:44,791
in all raids

135
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,291
and from now on,

136
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:49,291
Tien

137
00:34:50,958 --> 00:34:52,208
will replace me

138
00:34:52,708 --> 00:34:53,750
as leader.

139
00:38:03,291 --> 00:38:05,083
Why doesn't Dad teach me
the art of weaponry?

140
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,958
I don't want to learn the dancing art.

141
00:38:07,416 --> 00:38:08,375
I don't want to go.

142
00:38:09,125 --> 00:38:10,291
I want to be with Dad.

143
00:38:11,166 --> 00:38:13,123
You have to go study, you know?

144
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,541
So you'll be a great man.

145
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,666
Believe me, my son.

146
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:46,458
Pay respect to Master Bua.

147
00:38:46,875 --> 00:38:48,333
You have had a long journey.

148
00:38:49,416 --> 00:38:50,291
Let's go inside.

149
00:38:57,916 --> 00:38:59,208
It's been more than three months

150
00:39:00,291 --> 00:39:03,041
since Ayothaya took control
of the vassal states.

151
00:39:05,583 --> 00:39:07,500
The situation in the capital

152
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,958
is still in disorder.

153
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:12,666
But the Crown Prince

154
00:39:13,333 --> 00:39:14,541
is behaving impetuously.

155
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,750
The royal command

156
00:39:18,791 --> 00:39:19,791
has been given to me

157
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,250
to suppress resistance
in the protectorate territories.

158
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,958
Ayothaya is in such a rush
to expand its power.

159
00:39:28,291 --> 00:39:30,833
Didn't the city administrator,
Lord Rajasena,

160
00:39:31,333 --> 00:39:33,375
seek to oppose the Crown Prince?

161
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,291
Everything

162
00:39:38,750 --> 00:39:41,583
was Lord Rajasena's idea.

163
00:39:43,958 --> 00:39:46,041
Power is terrifying.

164
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,041
But those who abuse power

165
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:49,916
are even more terrifying.

166
00:39:50,625 --> 00:39:52,125
This country will be aflame.

167
00:39:52,916 --> 00:39:54,250
Innocent people

168
00:39:54,708 --> 00:39:56,291
in every corner will suffer.

169
00:39:57,666 --> 00:39:59,250
In this uncertain situation,

170
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,166
only to you and the master

171
00:40:04,916 --> 00:40:06,458
of this distant land

172
00:40:07,583 --> 00:40:08,791
can I entrust

173
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:11,500
my son's life.

174
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:13,583
Brother Bua.

175
00:40:15,666 --> 00:40:18,583
I feel like my heart has been pulled out.

176
00:40:21,041 --> 00:40:22,458
May you take pity on me

177
00:40:23,166 --> 00:40:25,875
and take care of him?

178
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,250
I will try my best.

179
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:35,416
You take care of yourselves as well.

180
00:40:36,625 --> 00:40:38,666
Muen Sri. Luang Krai.

181
00:40:39,666 --> 00:40:40,916
Take us out now.

182
00:40:42,541 --> 00:40:43,583
Yes, sir.

183
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,873
My name is Pim.

184
00:41:20,958 --> 00:41:23,000
My parents are both dead.

185
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,166
Master Bua

186
00:41:24,291 --> 00:41:26,458
has raised me since I was a baby.

187
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,916
How about you?

188
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,208
My father is Siha Decho.

189
00:41:32,583 --> 00:41:34,500
He's one of the four Eastern commanders

190
00:41:34,916 --> 00:41:35,791
of Ayothaya.

191
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,083
I told my father

192
00:41:38,708 --> 00:41:39,958
I wanted to learn about weapons

193
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:41,333
and fighting,

194
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,041
to be a great warrior like him.

195
00:41:45,041 --> 00:41:45,958
But instead,

196
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:49,833
he brought me here to learn about dance.

197
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,041
How can I fight anyone then?

198
00:42:11,166 --> 00:42:12,500
What a hoarse flute.

199
00:42:40,375 --> 00:42:41,458
Mhen!

200
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,375
Huh?

201
00:42:53,125 --> 00:42:56,791
Oh, itchy. Scratching your balls too?
I'm not itchy. Why am I scratching?

202
00:42:56,958 --> 00:42:58,125
Huh?

203
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,833
I have it too. The same.

204
00:43:01,708 --> 00:43:03,416
Throw it up.

205
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,000
Huh? Throw it away too.

206
00:43:09,208 --> 00:43:10,500
Throw.

207
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:15,583
Spin. Spin.

208
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,125
Spin. Spin.

209
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:21,250
Oh.

210
00:43:22,083 --> 00:43:23,083
He disappeared?

211
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:25,375
Oh, he's really gone.

212
00:43:27,875 --> 00:43:28,750
Gone.

213
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,250
Tien.

214
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:48,833
Do you think a person
who learns about weapons

215
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,958
can bring peace to the land?

216
00:43:54,625 --> 00:43:55,833
I only think that

217
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,083
learning about weapons

218
00:43:58,291 --> 00:43:59,458
to protect myself,

219
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,625
to help good people

220
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,208
and vanquish bad people,

221
00:44:04,291 --> 00:44:06,208
should contribute to bringing about peace.

222
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:08,416
Good.

223
00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:10,083
Well said.

224
00:44:12,333 --> 00:44:13,416
Tien.

225
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:16,708
There are a lot of weapons in this world.

226
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:22,333
Which one will you use
to help your people and country?

227
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,000
You don't have to answer me now.

228
00:45:08,625 --> 00:45:09,791
Take it.

229
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:40,000
Let the slave trade begin.

230
00:45:52,208 --> 00:45:55,750
-Hey, come here. Come.
-Let me go!

231
00:45:55,875 --> 00:45:58,458
Mom!

232
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:02,083
Let me go! My son!

233
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:04,083
My son!

234
00:46:07,166 --> 00:46:13,333
-Go!
-My son!

235
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:17,458
-Mom!
-Go!

236
00:46:18,333 --> 00:46:19,333
Hey! Silence!

237
00:46:19,416 --> 00:46:20,666
Mom!

238
00:46:22,375 --> 00:46:23,666
Mom!

239
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,208
Mom! Mom!

240
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,458
Ouch!

241
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,666
You bitch!

242
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:37,791
Mom!

243
00:46:37,916 --> 00:46:42,250
Mom!

244
00:46:57,625 --> 00:46:58,583
Who the hell?

245
00:47:01,333 --> 00:47:02,333
Was it you?

246
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:05,791
You?

247
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:07,291
You?

248
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,208
Hey!

249
00:47:20,333 --> 00:47:22,083
You want to drink?

250
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:23,875
Huh?

251
00:47:24,375 --> 00:47:28,333
Drink it! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!

252
00:48:18,541 --> 00:48:21,166
Come here!

253
00:48:21,916 --> 00:48:23,625
Come here!

254
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:31,791
Please spare my life.
I don't want to die. I have money.

255
00:51:32,166 --> 00:51:35,416
I have gold and slaves.
You can take them all if you want.

256
00:51:36,083 --> 00:51:37,000
Okay.

257
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:39,458
I'll give you a chance.

258
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:47,125
Like the one you gave to me.

259
00:51:59,875 --> 00:52:01,958
-Throw him into the crocodile pit!
-Huh?

260
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:03,041
No!

261
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:05,291
No!

262
00:52:05,458 --> 00:52:07,791
I don't want to die!

263
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:10,291
I don't want to die.

264
00:52:16,958 --> 00:52:17,958
Release all the slaves.

265
00:52:24,083 --> 00:52:27,500
My son.

266
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:34,666
It's all right now. Don't cry.

267
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:40,375
Thank you so much. Thank you.

268
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:36,458
Tien.

269
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,708
How long will you be away?

270
00:53:40,041 --> 00:53:42,166
Are you really leaving, Tien?

271
00:53:42,666 --> 00:53:45,625
Who will play with me if you're gone?

272
00:53:48,791 --> 00:53:53,375
I won't let you go, Tien! Tien, don't go!

273
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:56,083
Don't you worry.

274
00:53:59,708 --> 00:54:01,041
I'll be back soon.

275
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:04,416
Hurry, young master. We'll be late.

276
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:11,041
I have to go.

277
00:54:21,250 --> 00:54:22,250
Tien!

278
00:55:07,875 --> 00:55:09,291
Why are we in such a hurry?

279
00:55:16,625 --> 00:55:17,541
Luang Krai!

280
00:55:17,916 --> 00:55:19,458
Where are you taking the young master?

281
00:55:23,208 --> 00:55:25,750
How dare you betray the commander?
Traitor!

282
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,500
Young master, get away!

283
00:55:50,708 --> 00:55:51,583
You!

284
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:55,583
Yah!

285
00:56:21,166 --> 00:56:23,208
Let go!

286
00:56:23,833 --> 00:56:27,666
Let me go!

287
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:32,750
Let me go! Let go!

288
00:56:33,458 --> 00:56:35,166
Let go of me!

289
00:56:36,666 --> 00:56:38,125
Dad!

290
00:56:38,958 --> 00:56:41,166
Dad!

291
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:45,458
Let me go!

292
00:56:47,083 --> 00:56:49,250
Dad!

293
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:52,958
Dad!

294
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,416
Let me go! I said let me go!

295
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:01,625
Dad! Don't fight him!

296
00:57:08,416 --> 00:57:11,708
Let me go! I said let me go! Dad!

297
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:28,250
Dad! Dad!

298
00:57:31,791 --> 00:57:35,166
Dad!

299
00:57:36,041 --> 00:57:38,250
Dad!

300
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:40,625
Let me go.

301
00:57:42,583 --> 00:57:45,375
Let me go.

302
00:58:13,166 --> 00:58:16,166
You will die like your master!

303
00:58:18,833 --> 00:58:21,291
Rajasena! You bastard tyrant!

304
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:22,708
Kill him!

305
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:52,375
Dad!

306
00:58:55,666 --> 00:58:57,000
Get him!

307
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,125
Take care of yourself, young master.

308
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:20,500
Shoot!

309
00:59:45,666 --> 00:59:47,208
Get the boy.

310
01:00:21,666 --> 01:00:22,916
Are you sure?

311
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,916
The day I met you at the crocodile pit,

312
01:00:33,208 --> 01:00:35,916
you reminded me of someone.

313
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:38,375
That someone

314
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:41,208
was me when I was young.

315
01:00:43,416 --> 01:00:44,375
That day...

316
01:00:45,708 --> 01:00:47,750
your eyes were sun-parched.

317
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:52,083
The light in your eyes was strong
like fire in the wind.

318
01:00:53,958 --> 01:00:54,958
Today,

319
01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:59,166
it still shines in your eyes.

320
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:09,875
Actually,

321
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:14,833
I was going to make you
the outlaw leader today.

322
01:01:15,750 --> 01:01:18,250
But since you have
something on your mind,

323
01:01:19,750 --> 01:01:22,375
you should go and finish it.

324
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:26,375
I...

325
01:01:26,958 --> 01:01:28,583
and everyone at Garuda Wing Cliff...

326
01:01:32,833 --> 01:01:34,958
will be awaiting your return.

327
01:02:59,125 --> 01:03:00,041
Yah!

328
01:03:50,625 --> 01:03:52,041
Honorable governors,

329
01:03:53,791 --> 01:03:55,583
ministers,

330
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:56,916
royal advisors

331
01:03:58,333 --> 01:04:01,125
and valiant commanders.

332
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:04,541
Now is an auspicious time

333
01:04:05,541 --> 01:04:07,000
destined by heaven.

334
01:04:09,291 --> 01:04:10,166
I,

335
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:13,750
as the first monarch
of the Garuda Deva dynasty,

336
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:16,958
shall commence the holy ritual

337
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:20,166
to pay homage to this divine monument.

338
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:23,291
It shall stand as a symbol of the power

339
01:04:23,875 --> 01:04:25,666
of the Garuda Deva dynasty

340
01:04:26,333 --> 01:04:28,458
forever and a day.

341
01:11:30,832 --> 01:11:32,042
This is for my mother.

342
01:11:48,667 --> 01:11:49,625
Guards!

343
01:11:50,417 --> 01:11:52,207
This is for my father,

344
01:11:52,707 --> 01:11:54,457
Lord Siha Decho!

345
01:11:59,375 --> 01:12:00,832
Guards!

346
01:13:34,750 --> 01:13:36,042
Father Chernung!

347
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:38,292
I have returned!

348
01:27:53,667 --> 01:27:56,250
My blood is not for your sword to drink.

349
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:03,707
Guards, you don't have to waste
your energy.

350
01:28:05,917 --> 01:28:08,000
I have someone who wants to kill him,

351
01:28:09,207 --> 01:28:10,375
who has been waiting.

352
01:28:18,042 --> 01:28:20,500
Now, the clan of Siha Decho
has been wiped out.

353
01:28:22,417 --> 01:28:24,750
The only one left is his son.

354
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,082
He is standing right there.

355
01:28:31,417 --> 01:28:34,625
You shall hurry to finish

356
01:28:35,167 --> 01:28:37,332
what you still owe me.

357
01:28:56,917 --> 01:28:58,042
Father.

358
01:29:03,167 --> 01:29:05,332
A king shall never go back on his word.

359
01:29:06,750 --> 01:29:08,542
Your Majesty must keep your promise

360
01:29:11,542 --> 01:29:14,417
and spare the lives of my people...

361
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:19,417
whether I live or die.

362
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:26,332
The man in black in front of you

363
01:29:27,125 --> 01:29:28,792
is the one who killed your father.

364
01:29:30,167 --> 01:29:31,500
Kill him.

365
01:29:34,792 --> 01:29:36,082
Kill him!

366
01:29:36,375 --> 01:29:38,292
If you still have your strength.

367
01:30:13,792 --> 01:30:14,792
Rebel!

368
01:30:14,957 --> 01:30:16,457
Your clan deserves to be exterminated.

369
01:30:24,082 --> 01:30:25,707
Had I known you were one of them,

370
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:27,957
I would've killed you long ago.

371
01:30:37,832 --> 01:30:39,042
I'm the one

372
01:30:39,332 --> 01:30:40,792
who killed your father!

373
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,707
Let me repay your father's life

374
01:31:15,167 --> 01:31:16,207
with mine,

375
01:31:17,125 --> 01:31:18,167
my dear son.

376
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:05,832
Chernung!

377
01:32:13,542 --> 01:32:14,707
Take him away.

378
01:32:18,542 --> 01:32:21,042
But don't let him die too quickly.

379
01:32:23,167 --> 01:32:25,167
Punish him and make him suffer.

380
01:32:26,542 --> 01:32:28,457
Put him through the pain he deserves

381
01:32:30,375 --> 01:32:33,957
until his last breath.

382
01:32:39,582 --> 01:32:41,167
Tien's life has come to an end

383
01:32:41,832 --> 01:32:43,250
because of his cursed karma.

384
01:32:44,207 --> 01:32:45,542
If you all

385
01:32:46,082 --> 01:32:47,917
could unite the power of your minds,

386
01:32:48,332 --> 01:32:50,250
your strength of faith,

387
01:32:50,917 --> 01:32:53,417
to prolong his life,

388
01:32:54,042 --> 01:32:56,457
then his mind can be released from torment

389
01:32:57,082 --> 01:32:58,471
and return to his body.

390
01:37:32,043 --> 01:37:34,043
