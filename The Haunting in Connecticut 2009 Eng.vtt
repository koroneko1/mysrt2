You're watching from StreamFlex.app

01:56.500 --> 01:58.058
B mark.

02:02.606 --> 02:04.438
- Frame.
- Action.

02:06.411 --> 02:09.005
Why do you think
this happened to you?

02:09.211 --> 02:12.510
You mean why do bad things
happen to good people?

02:13.349 --> 02:15.317
That's the real question, right?

02:15.518 --> 02:17.349
Why us?

02:17.653 --> 02:20.713
I mean, that's really
what everybody wants to know.

02:22.091 --> 02:24.995
I moved into the house because
it's what we needed at that time.

02:25.197 --> 02:29.861
We didn't ask for this
and we didn't deserve it.

02:30.336 --> 02:33.395
The fact is, I don't know
why this happened to us.

02:33.672 --> 02:37.335
We were just a regular family
like anybody else.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.538
<i>The doctors didn't believe that...</i>

02:44.915 --> 02:49.181
<i>...he would survive,
and anyone who's had a sick child...</i>

02:49.386 --> 02:52.913
<i>...would understand the feeling
that you're losing your grasp on them...</i>

02:53.124 --> 02:58.255
<i>...and something's pulling them
from the other side...</i>

02:59.030 --> 03:02.158
<i>...which is really what was happening
in that house.</i>

03:03.334 --> 03:05.166
Please, God, don't make him suffer.

03:07.237 --> 03:09.500
Please make it work, or I'll never-

03:09.705 --> 03:14.335
You know, I hear that talking to yourself
is the first sign of losing it.

03:15.811 --> 03:19.248
I was not talking to myself.
I was talking to God.

03:19.449 --> 03:24.115
Well, threatening the creator
of the universe is, like, step two.

03:24.323 --> 03:26.019
That can't be good.

03:26.225 --> 03:28.625
I was not threatening him.

03:28.828 --> 03:32.389
I was simply letting him know
how precious you are to me.

03:33.466 --> 03:35.432
You gotta pull over, Mom.
I'm gonna be sick.

03:35.633 --> 03:37.032
Very funny.

03:37.235 --> 03:40.068
No, I'm serious.
I'm really gonna be sick.

03:41.139 --> 03:44.666
It's whatever. Just don't look,
Mom, okay? I'm all right.

03:52.351 --> 03:54.581
Come and get me,
wiener head.

03:54.787 --> 03:55.845
Hey, Mom.

03:56.055 --> 03:57.716
- Who you calling a wiener head?
- No.

03:57.923 --> 04:00.483
- Morning.
- Morning.

04:01.792 --> 04:04.158
Didn't hear you come in.
What time did you get home?

04:04.361 --> 04:06.056
Around 4.

04:06.263 --> 04:11.064
Jesus. I know it's a long way,
but how did it take you eight hours?

04:11.268 --> 04:14.796
You really wanna know how many times
we stopped so he could vomit?

04:15.673 --> 04:17.370
God.

04:18.111 --> 04:20.011
How is he now?

04:20.313 --> 04:23.249
He's all right.
I think he's still sleeping.

04:23.451 --> 04:25.941
- Let me get breakfast. You go to bed.
- It's okay.

04:26.152 --> 04:29.315
Wendy's helping
and I'm kind of wired from driving.

04:29.523 --> 04:31.784
- Good morning, Aunt Sara.
- Morning, honey.

04:31.989 --> 04:34.584
- Sorry about the chaos.
- It's better than my house.

04:34.793 --> 04:38.058
- Take this in to the hungry hordes.
- Yes.

04:39.465 --> 04:40.591
Okay, guys. Here you go.

04:40.799 --> 04:42.357
This is not good. One of these nights...

04:42.568 --> 04:44.695
...you'll drive off the road,
you'll be so tired.

04:44.903 --> 04:47.395
- I wish we could just move there.
- And in the meantime?

04:47.606 --> 04:48.904
Pay mortgage and a rent?

04:49.109 --> 04:51.077
And now we've taken in Wendy
and Mary and-

04:51.276 --> 04:53.711
One a built-in babysitter,
the other a little angel.

04:53.913 --> 04:55.312
I know, but...

04:55.515 --> 04:58.778
...every penny we have is sunken in
the business. We didn't plan on-

04:58.983 --> 05:02.180
Nobody plans on having a child
with cancer.

05:03.321 --> 05:05.050
You know that's not what I meant.

05:06.157 --> 05:07.988
I know.

05:22.776 --> 05:25.334
Look, you're right. Let's just do it.

05:25.944 --> 05:29.176
<i>Let's get a rental house in Connecticut
near the hospital.</i>

05:29.749 --> 05:33.241
<i>But what are you gonna do?
And how are we gonna afford it?</i>

05:33.452 --> 05:35.580
<i>I can come up on the weekends...</i>

05:35.788 --> 05:38.313
<i>...get a second mortgage
on our second mortgage.</i>

05:38.525 --> 05:40.993
<i>We're gonna make it through this,
right?</i>

05:41.561 --> 05:42.789
<i>Definitely.</i>

05:47.967 --> 05:49.663
See you.

05:50.036 --> 05:51.937
His skin may well get burned and red.

05:52.139 --> 05:53.763
It'll blister like a bad sunburn.

05:54.572 --> 05:55.665
<i>He threw up twice today.</i>

05:56.041 --> 05:58.874
<i>Well, that's his cells dying
and being reborn.</i>

05:59.077 --> 06:01.307
<i>Basically, we're waging war
inside Matt's body...</i>

06:01.513 --> 06:03.777
<i>...and the battle's just begun.</i>

06:03.982 --> 06:05.382
<i>That's what I'm afraid of.</i>

06:05.584 --> 06:08.885
<i>But he qualified for the study, Sara.
That's good.</i>

06:09.089 --> 06:11.115
<i>You did the right thing
by bringing him here.</i>

06:11.326 --> 06:12.691
<i>I know.</i>

06:39.220 --> 06:41.711
I don't wanna waste your time,
but how much you asking?

06:41.922 --> 06:46.359
I'll give you the first month free if I don't
have to finish hammering in this sign.

06:52.498 --> 06:55.898
Just needs some love and care and
a good family to bring it back to life.

06:56.101 --> 06:59.037
- So you don't mind children?
- Where would we be without them?

06:59.939 --> 07:01.405
It's perfect.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.372
I mean, it's everything we need.

07:03.578 --> 07:08.982
It's spacious and affordable and I'm
just wondering, where's the catch?

07:09.184 --> 07:10.742
Well...

07:10.952 --> 07:12.386
It does have a bit of a history.

07:13.589 --> 07:16.852
I saw one
that was almost perfect, but...

07:18.492 --> 07:19.959
It just...

07:21.095 --> 07:23.188
It just wasn't right.

07:40.415 --> 07:43.680
They said you'd have body aches,
but no nausea.

07:45.285 --> 07:49.551
Doctor says to patient,
"I've got bad news.

07:50.423 --> 07:54.724
You've got cancer
and you've got Alzheimer's."

07:55.095 --> 07:57.289
Patient says:

07:59.201 --> 08:02.728
"Oh, man. At least I don't have cancer."

08:03.973 --> 08:06.066
At least you won't lose your hair again.

08:08.110 --> 08:10.169
Well, that's something.

08:25.527 --> 08:28.462
- I brought a mattress.
- I can't thank you enough.

08:28.663 --> 08:30.756
Oh, really, don't worry.

08:30.965 --> 08:32.899
- Here's the keys.
- Thanks. Is the heat on?

08:33.101 --> 08:34.797
- Oh, it's really warm in there.
- Okay.

08:35.004 --> 08:38.496
All right. Now you get in and settle.
I'll take this.

08:40.774 --> 08:42.639
I don't know. You know, he was so sick.

08:43.811 --> 08:46.302
And I like this place. It's what we need.

08:46.513 --> 08:50.210
Well, I made an executive decision.
You weren't here.

08:51.019 --> 08:54.456
And he was in so much pain. I just
couldn't put him through another mile.

09:32.728 --> 09:34.856
Oh, great.

11:33.249 --> 11:34.683
Hey.

11:35.352 --> 11:37.251
You okay?

11:39.288 --> 11:41.225
Yeah, it was just a bad dream.

11:43.094 --> 11:44.119
Okay.

11:54.673 --> 11:57.231
Pick of the house, okay?
Any bedroom you want.

11:57.440 --> 11:59.204
Drink this.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.777
They're not that bad.

12:08.986 --> 12:11.147
- All right. Cheers.
- Keep telling yourself that.

12:11.355 --> 12:13.949
Great. Have you ever had one?

12:16.395 --> 12:17.952
Yeah.

14:13.012 --> 14:14.671
Matt?

14:16.414 --> 14:18.781
Matt, did you find a bedroom?

14:19.418 --> 14:21.214
Yeah, I did.

14:33.901 --> 14:36.335
Or it kind of picked me.

14:37.137 --> 14:40.005
- What do you mean, it picked you?
- I don't know. It's the meds.

14:40.208 --> 14:42.070
I don't know what I'm talking about.

14:42.274 --> 14:45.073
Well, which bedroom?

14:46.713 --> 14:48.704
Down here?

14:49.415 --> 14:50.677
- No.
- Why? Come on.

14:50.883 --> 14:54.683
Look, it's nice and it's cool, and best,
it's got its own private bathroom.

14:54.887 --> 14:56.912
Nobody has to hear me.

14:57.123 --> 14:58.590
You don't have to hide from us.

14:58.791 --> 15:00.486
The fact that everybody can
hear me puking...

15:00.694 --> 15:02.422
...it just makes me feel worse, okay?

15:18.043 --> 15:21.740
- What do you think's back there?
- I don't know.

15:22.214 --> 15:24.913
- Hello. Anybody home?
- You okay?

15:25.119 --> 15:26.144
Scared me.

15:26.354 --> 15:28.913
- Hello?
- We're down here.

15:29.123 --> 15:31.183
First one upstairs
gets first choice of rooms.

15:31.392 --> 15:32.359
Mary.

15:32.560 --> 15:36.155
Mary, wait until Aunt Sara and Uncle
Peter tell us where our rooms are.

15:36.364 --> 15:37.592
- Mary.
- No.

15:37.797 --> 15:40.288
- No, it's not fair. I want that room.
- Little monsters.

15:44.170 --> 15:48.540
- No, watch it.
- I got it. I got it.

15:48.876 --> 15:52.175
I'm not gonna croak from carrying
a lamp and an empty suitcase.

15:52.379 --> 15:54.506
That's not what I meant.

15:54.715 --> 15:57.377
I was worried about you
scratching the truck.

15:57.618 --> 16:00.110
- Carry on.
- Okay.

16:03.857 --> 16:06.950
Well, it's a little dark, but,
hey, I was a teenager once.

16:09.862 --> 16:11.489
What's in here?

16:12.532 --> 16:14.659
I don't know. I couldn't open it.

16:20.108 --> 16:21.598
Well...

16:22.178 --> 16:24.839
The doorknob turns, but...

16:28.918 --> 16:31.751
Maybe they sealed it for storage.

16:32.188 --> 16:34.780
Got a great room for Billy...

16:34.988 --> 16:37.388
...and Mary.

16:38.058 --> 16:39.923
And this...

16:40.127 --> 16:42.687
...I thought was a perfect room for you.

16:42.897 --> 16:44.329
And why do you say that?

16:44.531 --> 16:46.999
Well, because it's got a beautiful view...

16:47.201 --> 16:49.692
...and lots of space...

16:49.904 --> 16:53.601
...and a huge closet.

16:55.643 --> 16:57.907
- You like? Okay.
- Yeah.

17:05.084 --> 17:09.021
Hey. I still don't know why
you wanna stay down here.

17:26.709 --> 17:28.473
- Whoa, Mom.
- What?

17:36.651 --> 17:38.551
Are you okay?

17:41.055 --> 17:43.547
Yeah, just thanks for cleaning my room.

17:43.758 --> 17:44.918
No problem.

18:18.862 --> 18:21.228
- Why'd you put the plates back?
- What?

18:22.832 --> 18:25.061
Well, I put the plates out,
and now they're back.

18:25.768 --> 18:27.962
I didn't touch them, sweetie.

18:30.439 --> 18:32.202
Are you all right?

18:39.048 --> 18:41.073
Oh, that's-
Know what, that was my fault.

18:41.283 --> 18:43.774
- They're too heavy.
- No, it's okay. I didn't drop them.

18:43.986 --> 18:45.784
- Well, how did they-
- I don't know. I-

18:45.989 --> 18:48.149
I just saw them up there
and I just- I don't-

18:48.357 --> 18:51.259
- You know, Dr. Brooks said-
- I know what Dr. Brooks said, okay?

18:51.461 --> 18:55.258
He said that if I'm seeing things,
then he'll drop me from the trial.

18:55.495 --> 18:57.794
- But if you-
- I'm not seeing things.

18:58.566 --> 19:03.333
I'm just- I'm tired. And I remember I put
the dishes too close to the edge, so...

19:03.538 --> 19:05.939
You know, you tell me
if something like that happens.

19:06.375 --> 19:09.402
- Promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

19:14.251 --> 19:15.843
I'm so sorry I broke the dishes.

19:16.721 --> 19:18.120
It's okay, sweetie.

19:24.660 --> 19:26.993
Come on, come on.

19:28.698 --> 19:30.961
Got you. It. You're so-

19:31.166 --> 19:34.329
Oh, the burgers. The burgers.
Wait, wait, wait.

19:34.704 --> 19:37.138
- Come and get me.
- All right.

19:48.085 --> 19:51.541
Remember when we used to go
camping when you were young?

19:52.320 --> 19:54.118
Every night you would...

19:54.757 --> 19:58.158
...fall asleep counting the stars,
and you could never finish.

19:58.627 --> 20:00.754
Used to drive you nuts.

20:03.601 --> 20:06.195
You know, most of the stars
that we see are already dead.

20:09.775 --> 20:11.902
They look pretty alive to me.

20:14.413 --> 20:16.971
That's because they haven't gotten
the news yet.

20:31.928 --> 20:33.453
Hey.

20:34.899 --> 20:35.887
You all right?

20:37.068 --> 20:38.865
Yeah. Everything's cool.

20:40.438 --> 20:42.167
- You sure?
- Yeah.

20:42.907 --> 20:44.463
All right.

20:45.174 --> 20:46.835
Give me five.

20:47.042 --> 20:51.035
Up high. Down low. Too slow.

20:52.514 --> 20:54.142
I love you.

20:54.784 --> 20:58.152
You know, it's sort of like a vacation.

20:58.923 --> 21:00.289
Yeah, if Matt wasn't sick-

21:00.492 --> 21:03.290
And you get your own room,
like a big girl.

21:03.495 --> 21:05.725
Sure you're not gonna be scared
in here all alone?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.455
I've got my toys.

21:07.666 --> 21:08.998
Okay.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.691
You go.

21:11.137 --> 21:14.798
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

21:15.005 --> 21:20.307
If I shall die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take. Amen.

22:10.294 --> 22:13.161
To bind the spirits.

23:31.475 --> 23:33.103
Noncontact dermatitis.

23:33.311 --> 23:36.040
A trauma in one place manifests
on another part of the body.

23:36.247 --> 23:37.772
It's not uncommon.

23:37.982 --> 23:42.180
No fever. Excellent. Less nausea.
Good. Even a bit of an appetite.

23:42.387 --> 23:45.051
Outstanding. And no visual
or auditory hallucinations...

23:45.259 --> 23:47.227
...or other behavioral abnormalities?

23:49.596 --> 23:51.291
Anything?

23:53.233 --> 23:54.291
No.

23:54.502 --> 23:56.696
Then we can continue to stage two.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.394
Careful.

24:02.708 --> 24:04.141
Watch your step.

24:04.343 --> 24:07.369
Okay, you're almost there.

24:09.850 --> 24:12.283
- Thank you.
- Okay.

24:12.485 --> 24:14.716
I forgot my purse.
I'll be right back. Wait here.

24:14.921 --> 24:17.252
- Okay.
- All right?

24:27.232 --> 24:28.631
Mom?

24:33.905 --> 24:38.103
The blue one that he takes for nausea?
Twenty-five bucks a pill.

24:38.910 --> 24:42.507
I know. I tried.
But, Peter, I was on hold for an hour.

25:40.842 --> 25:42.538
Matt?

25:42.878 --> 25:44.469
Matt.

25:44.813 --> 25:46.508
Where are you?

25:46.715 --> 25:48.615
I'm in here.

26:05.833 --> 26:07.994
How'd you get in here?

26:10.037 --> 26:12.562
What is this place?

26:29.389 --> 26:30.981
Hop on.

26:35.497 --> 26:37.362
Take you for a ride.

26:44.307 --> 26:45.672
Slow down.

26:56.317 --> 26:58.149
Matt. Matt.

27:02.523 --> 27:04.219
Stop.

27:04.426 --> 27:06.552
Let me off!

27:08.529 --> 27:09.622
Stop.

27:10.933 --> 27:12.093
Matt. Matt.

27:17.337 --> 27:19.898
- What's going on down here?
- What's the matter with you?

27:20.107 --> 27:22.574
I guess I must've loosened it.

27:47.803 --> 27:49.668
Good Lord.

28:01.718 --> 28:04.209
Now we know
why the rent was so cheap.

28:10.457 --> 28:13.188
What did you know, and when the hell
did you know it? Jesus.

28:13.394 --> 28:14.952
Know what?

28:15.162 --> 28:16.390
What this place was.

28:17.732 --> 28:19.962
Aren't you the one
who says we can't live on lies?

28:20.167 --> 28:22.636
Well, that's before,
when you were a drunk and a liar.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.838
Right, but I'm not now.

28:28.746 --> 28:30.373
I know.

28:31.415 --> 28:32.905
I'm sorry, Peter.

28:33.117 --> 28:37.176
And you're right, I should've told you.
It just...

28:38.287 --> 28:43.247
We needed a place,
and it just seemed perfect.

28:48.064 --> 28:53.195
Okay, so we all know now
that this was a funeral home.

28:53.403 --> 28:55.200
Big deal.

28:56.639 --> 28:59.301
It's not now and it hasn't been
for years and years.

28:59.509 --> 29:01.876
It's just a house.

29:02.713 --> 29:05.703
Bricks and nails and wood.

29:07.282 --> 29:11.218
It's our house until Matt finishes
at the hospital.

29:11.420 --> 29:13.388
And we're all under a lot of stress...

29:13.589 --> 29:16.023
...so we need to pull together
like a team, okay?

29:19.196 --> 29:22.997
Okay. So who wants to say grace?

29:23.735 --> 29:25.326
Matt?

29:33.543 --> 29:35.067
<i>Matt?</i>

29:57.167 --> 29:58.691
<i>- Matt.
- Jonah. Jonah.</i>

30:27.565 --> 30:28.997
<i>Honey?</i>

30:31.168 --> 30:32.964
Are you all right?

30:33.337 --> 30:34.304
Matt?

30:42.346 --> 30:44.144
- What's wrong?
- It's the medicine.

30:52.691 --> 30:54.624
Didn't you see it?

30:58.695 --> 31:00.322
Come on.

31:07.738 --> 31:08.795
<i>So, what happened?</i>

31:14.246 --> 31:17.272
Do you remember that book we
used to read when we were little kids?

31:17.483 --> 31:18.974
The one with all...

31:19.185 --> 31:20.380
...the weird pictures?

31:20.586 --> 31:22.451
<i>The Man Who Wasn't There.</i>

31:22.655 --> 31:24.416
Used to love that book.

31:24.621 --> 31:26.021
Yeah, I remember.

31:26.224 --> 31:31.856
<i>As I was walking up the stair
I saw a man who wasn't there</i>

31:32.063 --> 31:34.223
<i>He wasn't there again today</i>

31:34.432 --> 31:37.026
<i>- Oh, how I wish he'd go away
- Oh, how I wish he'd go away</i>

31:37.235 --> 31:38.759
Yeah.

31:41.974 --> 31:43.372
Do you remember the other one?

31:44.075 --> 31:45.873
Maybe. Which one?

31:48.414 --> 31:50.678
<i>It was one bright day
In the middle of the night</i>

31:52.182 --> 31:54.047
<i>Two dead boys got up to fight</i>

31:55.085 --> 31:56.950
<i>Back-to-back they faced one another</i>

31:57.154 --> 31:59.850
<i>They drew their swords
And they shot each other</i>

32:00.457 --> 32:02.118
<i>A deaf policeman, he heard the noise</i>

32:02.327 --> 32:05.785
<i>And he came
And he killed those two dead boys</i>

32:07.501 --> 32:08.866
Matt, you're scaring me.

32:14.107 --> 32:16.302
Well, join the club.

32:54.212 --> 32:57.807
Oh, now, that didn't hurt.

33:01.555 --> 33:03.045
You were dreaming.

33:03.256 --> 33:05.622
Been breathing heavy,
and so, of course...

33:05.826 --> 33:10.628
...it can either mean it was
a very bad dream or a very good one.

33:12.132 --> 33:13.964
Well, I've had better.

33:20.706 --> 33:24.335
I don't know, it's just, like,
that sometimes lately it's been tough.

33:24.911 --> 33:26.104
What?

33:27.079 --> 33:30.776
I don't know, like, do you ever,
like, see things?

33:30.984 --> 33:33.952
Like, hear things that just-
They can't be there?

33:36.523 --> 33:41.688
You don't ever wanna tell them
you can see things, okay?

33:41.895 --> 33:44.158
They're not gonna understand.

33:48.066 --> 33:49.762
I remember when my wife was dying...

33:49.969 --> 33:54.167
...that whole last day
I sat there praying, crying.

33:54.640 --> 33:57.839
And she never once looked up at me.

33:58.546 --> 34:01.606
She just looked all around her.

34:02.316 --> 34:04.910
At all the others in the room.

34:05.954 --> 34:07.682
But we were alone.

34:09.123 --> 34:11.058
Or so I thought.

34:12.559 --> 34:15.995
See, she was where we are.

34:17.163 --> 34:19.063
In the valley...

34:20.800 --> 34:22.927
...of the shadow of death.

34:27.274 --> 34:31.438
Hey, you know what to do
when you find yourself in the valley?

34:32.413 --> 34:33.380
No.

34:34.748 --> 34:36.739
Fear no evil.

34:41.120 --> 34:45.114
If you wanna talk or...

34:47.460 --> 34:48.983
Just call. Any time.

34:49.194 --> 34:51.186
Are you sure
you have to go home tonight?

34:51.398 --> 34:54.129
If I'm not there at the site
first thing in the morning...

34:54.335 --> 34:57.897
...they will hire another contractor
and then, you know...

35:01.243 --> 35:02.505
I'm proud of you.

35:02.711 --> 35:03.973
What, me?

35:04.179 --> 35:05.772
- Yeah.
- For what?

35:06.948 --> 35:09.279
For working so hard.

35:10.617 --> 35:13.177
And for keeping your promises.

35:14.188 --> 35:15.415
All of them.

35:20.962 --> 35:24.363
You're naughty.
You can't play with that.

35:24.565 --> 35:26.261
It's mine.

35:26.467 --> 35:29.766
You know, you're a bad doll.
You said you would make Matt better.

35:31.505 --> 35:34.304
You said you would, but you lied.
"No, I didn't."

35:34.509 --> 35:36.406
Oh, yes, you did. You said you would.

35:36.608 --> 35:38.600
You're gonna have to have
a timeout and...

35:38.812 --> 35:40.938
I'm gonna put you in the timeout corner.

35:41.581 --> 35:43.674
"That's really mean."

35:50.659 --> 35:52.355
Turn the lights on, please.

35:54.464 --> 35:55.452
Thank you.

36:14.349 --> 36:16.043
Matt?

36:23.458 --> 36:26.052
Come on, honey. Come on.

36:56.794 --> 36:59.259
Hey, hey, hey, watch it.
Watch the milk.

36:59.460 --> 37:01.861
Billy, I'm serious.

37:02.064 --> 37:04.191
- Is Mary a total goon?
- No.

37:04.399 --> 37:05.889
"Oh, yeah."

37:07.202 --> 37:09.398
Is Billy a poop head?

37:09.604 --> 37:10.901
"But of course, my dear."

37:11.107 --> 37:13.006
Language, language.
Here. Eat, eat, eat.

37:13.575 --> 37:16.272
Come on. Stop.
I gotta go to work, okay?

37:16.712 --> 37:18.338
Wendy is in charge.

37:18.647 --> 37:19.614
Okay?

37:19.815 --> 37:22.114
I'm sorry, honey.

37:23.820 --> 37:25.412
See you, Mom.

37:26.387 --> 37:29.686
You be good or else you guys
have to deal with me.

37:30.191 --> 37:31.659
Okay?

37:32.493 --> 37:35.054
I'm just kidding. It's okay.

37:35.597 --> 37:38.190
Fifty-one, 52...

37:38.400 --> 37:43.465
...53, 54, 55...

37:43.674 --> 37:50.205
...56, 57, 58, 59, 60.

37:51.616 --> 37:53.549
Here I come.

38:26.882 --> 38:27.906
Jonah.

38:32.255 --> 38:33.983
Jonah!

38:42.099 --> 38:43.533
Jonah!

38:44.269 --> 38:46.430
Where are you, son?

38:49.174 --> 38:50.662
Come here.

38:51.007 --> 38:52.441
- Don't.
- You're not leaving.

38:52.643 --> 38:54.769
I'm sorry.

39:56.673 --> 39:58.573
Wendy?

39:59.310 --> 40:01.436
Wendy! Help! Wendy!

40:14.290 --> 40:15.588
Oh, for God's sakes.

40:16.493 --> 40:17.618
Just leave me alone.

40:20.864 --> 40:23.229
It's okay, it's okay.

40:23.433 --> 40:25.264
Come on, guys. Let's go.

40:25.469 --> 40:28.372
Billy. Come on.

40:40.119 --> 40:41.813
<i>It's okay, son. It's okay.</i>

40:42.020 --> 40:46.423
<i>- I just- I don't know who else to talk to.
- No, no, no. I'm glad you called.</i>

40:46.624 --> 40:50.185
It's all around us, all the time.

40:50.796 --> 40:53.127
The living and the dead.

40:53.331 --> 40:55.732
Invisible to everyone.

40:56.168 --> 40:58.067
Almost everyone.

40:58.269 --> 40:59.259
Yeah.

40:59.470 --> 41:01.496
Because we're not like
other people anymore.

41:01.707 --> 41:04.869
You see, most people spend
their life firmly planted in this world...

41:05.076 --> 41:09.375
...then one day, they go straight
to the other side, but we...

41:10.047 --> 41:11.844
We take a much more roundabout path.

41:12.049 --> 41:15.917
We spend quite a lot of time
in the borderland.

41:16.454 --> 41:20.787
But either way, only one thing matters.

41:21.659 --> 41:23.561
Yeah, what's that?

41:26.065 --> 41:28.933
Well, find out what he wants from you.

42:09.507 --> 42:11.065
Okay.

42:21.821 --> 42:23.687
What do you want from me?

42:51.384 --> 42:54.876
You know,
that was actually my favorite movie.

42:57.590 --> 42:59.683
- Mom?
- Aunt Sara?

43:01.359 --> 43:03.088
Mom.

43:28.254 --> 43:31.223
You should've told me about this.
These symptoms can be a sign...

43:31.424 --> 43:34.291
...that it's moved to the brain.
But Matt's MRIs are all clear.

43:34.494 --> 43:35.825
He has no tumors.

43:36.029 --> 43:38.998
Whatever was causing the behaviors,
it wasn't that.

43:39.432 --> 43:42.458
I'm just afraid he's gonna lose
his mind before he can get better.

43:42.669 --> 43:47.004
This is a crucial time, but he is still an
excellent candidate for this treatment.

43:47.208 --> 43:49.573
Age counts enormously, and attitude.

43:49.776 --> 43:51.404
Attitude?

43:51.612 --> 43:53.807
His own family is afraid of him.

44:01.321 --> 44:02.288
Where's your truck?

44:03.522 --> 44:05.081
I sold it.

44:06.793 --> 44:07.816
Why didn't you tell me?

44:09.529 --> 44:11.294
I just did.

44:11.500 --> 44:15.436
Paid the last round of bills,
this month's mortgage. Today.

44:15.637 --> 44:18.265
Like doc says, attitude.

44:34.054 --> 44:35.487
Oh, honey.

44:37.458 --> 44:40.359
I'm so sorry.
I just love you so much.

44:40.995 --> 44:42.395
Mom, love hurts.

44:46.467 --> 44:48.265
Mom, just-

44:50.839 --> 44:52.395
Look, I want you to know that if-

44:52.605 --> 44:54.436
If what?

44:54.774 --> 44:56.901
- That if I die-
- You won't.

45:03.083 --> 45:05.518
- it's not your fault.

45:43.926 --> 45:45.449
No.

45:46.361 --> 45:50.626
No. You can't have him.

45:54.969 --> 45:57.699
Can't have my son.

47:12.815 --> 47:14.645
Hey.

47:14.949 --> 47:16.542
We're bored.

47:16.752 --> 47:18.344
Please play with us.

47:18.554 --> 47:20.715
Why don't you ask Matt?

47:23.926 --> 47:25.519
Yeah, why don't you ask Matt?

47:28.998 --> 47:30.762
You okay?

47:31.200 --> 47:32.691
I'm outstanding.

47:34.771 --> 47:36.568
Okay, come on, guys.
I'll count to 30...

47:36.773 --> 47:40.002
...and let's see if we can find some
new hiding places this time.

47:42.610 --> 47:44.009
Matt.

47:50.952 --> 47:52.513
Go on.

48:01.199 --> 48:08.001
One, two, three, four, five.

48:34.230 --> 48:35.390
There's room for me too.

48:35.598 --> 48:36.791
Find your own spot.

48:38.100 --> 48:40.261
Twenty-nine, 30.

48:40.469 --> 48:42.369
Ready or not, here I come.

50:07.992 --> 50:10.223
Let me out of here!

50:10.428 --> 50:11.452
Help!

50:12.598 --> 50:14.462
Get me out of here!

50:15.868 --> 50:16.835
Get me out!

50:19.605 --> 50:21.163
Get me out of here!

50:22.941 --> 50:25.601
What happened? What? Come here.

50:25.809 --> 50:28.175
What? What is it? What?

50:31.849 --> 50:32.837
Okay.

50:35.285 --> 50:36.981
- Mary?
- I'm over here.

50:37.188 --> 50:39.488
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

50:39.692 --> 50:42.820
Wait. Be careful.
Hey, the floor must be rotten.

50:43.029 --> 50:44.860
- Rotten? Where?
- Well, here for sure...

50:45.064 --> 50:46.554
...where Mary's leg fell through.

50:46.767 --> 50:48.427
Just stand back, okay?

50:48.635 --> 50:50.068
Hey.

50:50.270 --> 50:52.603
- You're okay.
- Bugs.

50:52.806 --> 50:55.601
Okay. Come here. You okay? Yeah?

51:02.948 --> 51:04.142
What is that?

51:10.923 --> 51:14.256
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my.

51:30.608 --> 51:32.304
What is it?

51:34.046 --> 51:36.174
Okay. Come on.

51:36.382 --> 51:37.372
Playtime's over.

51:38.385 --> 51:40.285
God, they're all...

51:41.188 --> 51:42.154
...dead.

51:43.524 --> 51:46.789
So sad. It's probably the only time
they ever had their photo taken.

52:00.673 --> 52:02.641
What are those?

52:03.376 --> 52:05.071
I don't know.

52:11.584 --> 52:12.551
You all right?

52:12.752 --> 52:14.345
Yeah.

52:16.290 --> 52:18.916
These are really weird.
It has to be fake.

52:21.093 --> 52:22.320
Let me see those.

52:32.806 --> 52:34.434
What?

52:36.578 --> 52:38.671
- Nothing.
- Matt, come on.

52:38.879 --> 52:40.438
Just give me a chance.

52:47.487 --> 52:50.115
- I've seen him.
- Shut up.

52:50.324 --> 52:52.154
Gave you a chance.

52:52.492 --> 52:54.757
I'm sorry, okay? Just...

52:55.496 --> 52:56.484
Go on.

52:57.531 --> 52:59.226
Please?

53:01.402 --> 53:04.268
I thought that I was hallucinating,
but I have seen this kid...

53:04.471 --> 53:07.201
...almost every day
since we've been here.

53:09.343 --> 53:11.072
Okay, I wake up in the middle
of the night...

53:11.279 --> 53:13.540
...and it feels like he's been inside me...

53:13.745 --> 53:16.408
...looking out through my eyes.

53:17.250 --> 53:19.741
<i>One bright day
In the middle of the night</i>

53:19.951 --> 53:23.217
<i>Two dead boys got up to fight</i>

53:23.556 --> 53:25.717
Okay, me and him,
we're just two dead boys.

53:33.501 --> 53:34.934
Maybe the place is haunted.

53:35.804 --> 53:39.433
Either way,
I mean, we need to find out...

53:39.641 --> 53:43.598
...who put these things
under the floorboards and why.

53:43.811 --> 53:45.710
Yeah, but how?

53:46.246 --> 53:49.705
Okay, well, don't tell anyone,
but there are these buildings...

53:49.917 --> 53:55.048
...all over the country where
secret knowledge is kept, known only...

53:56.791 --> 53:58.053
...as libraries.

54:11.537 --> 54:14.938
<i>Okay, so check it out:
"A Case of Materialization."</i>

54:15.141 --> 54:18.509
That is Ramsey Aickman,
and this was his mortuary.

54:19.213 --> 54:23.743
Now, he had a very interesting hobby:
psychical research.

54:23.953 --> 54:27.013
<i>And your guy, dead kid,
his name was Jonah...</i>

54:27.289 --> 54:29.917
<i>...and he was Aickman's assistant
and a medium.</i>

54:30.659 --> 54:33.025
<i>Supposedly, they contacted
the dead through Jonah...</i>

54:33.230 --> 54:36.196
<i>...and people came to have chats
with their dead hubby or wife...</i>

54:36.396 --> 54:38.887
...or find out where Auntie Mame
hid the family jewels.

54:39.100 --> 54:43.469
Now, he claims that he discovered
how to amplify the séances.

54:43.671 --> 54:47.471
So he not only contacted the dead,
but he made things appear.

54:47.675 --> 54:49.267
What things?

54:49.477 --> 54:51.377
Ectoplasm.

54:51.579 --> 54:53.570
And what is ectoplasm?

54:54.282 --> 54:58.617
<i>A mysterious protoplasmic substance
streaming out of the body of mediums.</i>

54:59.155 --> 55:02.181
<i>So it's just like in those pictures
in the box.</i>

55:02.390 --> 55:06.189
<i>Photographs of ectoplasm often
show a gelatinous material oozing...</i>

55:06.393 --> 55:08.486
<i>...from all the natural orifices
of the medium.</i>

55:08.695 --> 55:13.655
<i>From mouth, ears, nose, eyes
and even the lower orifices.</i>

55:13.868 --> 55:18.603
So Aickman held all those séances
in this house...

55:18.808 --> 55:21.173
<i>...and people came
from all over and were convinced.</i>

55:21.378 --> 55:24.279
<i>Harvard professors,
all kinds of big shots.</i>

55:24.848 --> 55:28.284
<i>I mean, Aickman and Jonah's
séances were famous.</i>

55:29.186 --> 55:30.949
Well, do we know
what happened to him?

55:31.154 --> 55:32.847
Well, here's where it gets
a little weirder.

55:33.021 --> 55:34.990
So there was a séance
led by Aickman...

55:35.191 --> 55:36.680
<i>...with Jonah as the medium.</i>

55:36.891 --> 55:39.326
All four sitters and Aickman
were found dead.

55:40.429 --> 55:43.363
- Cause of death not clear.
- So Jonah killed them.

55:43.565 --> 55:45.193
Nobody knows. No sign of him.

55:45.401 --> 55:48.164
He was missing, vanished,
never seen again.

55:49.004 --> 55:49.971
Well, until now.

55:51.240 --> 55:54.209
Well, here's the weirdest part of all.
Okay, so 30 years later...

55:54.410 --> 55:56.241
<i>...when they expanded the highway...</i>

55:56.445 --> 55:58.003
<i>...they did the detour through
the cemetery-</i>

55:58.214 --> 56:00.272
<i>Wait, we've been on that road
a million times.</i>

56:00.481 --> 56:03.745
<i>This is the thing: When they tried
to relocate some of the old plots...</i>

56:03.951 --> 56:06.284
...they found something weird,
or didn't find.

56:06.487 --> 56:08.387
- What?
- Over a hundred bodies...

56:08.590 --> 56:11.423
...that were supposed to be there
weren't, just empty...

56:11.626 --> 56:13.059
...coffins filled with sandbags.

56:14.631 --> 56:16.258
Someone stole the bodies.

56:16.467 --> 56:18.400
Aickman.

56:18.602 --> 56:20.594
Or Jonah. Aickman or Jonah.

56:20.805 --> 56:22.533
Maybe, but why?

56:25.743 --> 56:30.678
I don't know,
but I might know somebody who does.

56:35.919 --> 56:38.352
- Remarkable.
- Do you think it's real?

56:38.821 --> 56:43.690
Well, I've seen plenty of fakes,
but I've seen the real thing once.

56:44.627 --> 56:46.357
Paris. It...

56:46.563 --> 56:51.398
It was the most horrible thing
I've ever seen, but not this.

56:51.601 --> 56:53.262
Must've been a very powerful medium.

57:31.541 --> 57:32.565
What are they?

57:32.776 --> 57:34.107
Eyelids.

57:35.478 --> 57:36.605
Human eyelids.

57:37.882 --> 57:38.973
Well, what are they for?

57:40.050 --> 57:42.076
Necromancy.

57:42.285 --> 57:43.809
Corpse-bothering.

57:45.256 --> 57:47.622
It's a loathsome form of magic.

57:47.825 --> 57:53.523
It's seeking power through control
of the dead via relics of their bodies.

57:53.729 --> 57:54.923
Well, why eyelids?

57:55.698 --> 57:57.496
That's a good question.

57:58.435 --> 58:01.528
I mean, traditionally we'd close the eyes
of the dead so they may...

58:01.737 --> 58:03.296
...rest in darkness.

58:03.506 --> 58:08.502
Now, removing their eyelids keeps
their eyes open, makes them see.

58:10.415 --> 58:13.248
Perhaps he intended them
to be watchmen...

58:14.186 --> 58:16.950
...or guardians of this house...

58:17.589 --> 58:18.953
...or of his secrets.

58:19.156 --> 58:21.589
By the way, I mean,
somewhere there are the bodies...

58:21.791 --> 58:25.660
...that belong to these people,
and he used them.

58:26.497 --> 58:30.399
I think ultimately, Aickman intended
to enhance Jonah's powers.

58:31.302 --> 58:33.497
Well, he amplified his séances.

58:33.704 --> 58:36.901
Somehow he bound the spirits of the
dead to their bodies, yes...

58:37.108 --> 58:41.238
...as an amplifier, probably through
some form of ritual or desecration.

58:43.047 --> 58:45.141
Perhaps buried outside the house?

58:50.019 --> 58:53.978
Perhaps it would help if we prayed
for all those poor souls that died here.

58:55.658 --> 58:57.421
For the boy too.

59:14.512 --> 59:15.604
<i>Mommy?</i>

59:15.813 --> 59:17.838
<i>- Come back.
- Mommy?</i>

59:19.183 --> 59:21.310
<i>Please, please, help me.</i>

59:29.326 --> 59:30.487
<i>- Mommy.
- Help me.</i>

59:32.831 --> 59:34.058
Matt.

01:00:07.768 --> 01:00:08.961
Matt.

01:00:37.962 --> 01:00:39.691
Matt. Who are you?

01:00:39.897 --> 01:00:41.330
What are you doing in my house?

01:00:41.532 --> 01:00:42.898
- Matt?
- I'm a reverend.

01:00:43.101 --> 01:00:44.658
It's okay. We asked him to come.

01:00:44.869 --> 01:00:46.336
- Asked him?
- We met at the-

01:00:46.537 --> 01:00:48.438
- Get out of my house.
- Get off. It's fine.

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:50.800
We met at the hospital.
I receive treatment.

01:00:51.008 --> 01:00:53.172
- Get out.
- Well, he called me for advice.

01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:55.370
- It's a little hard to explain.
- Try.

01:00:55.582 --> 01:01:01.145
I believe that there is something evil
in this house...

01:01:01.355 --> 01:01:03.880
...something no longer living
and not yet passed over.

01:01:04.092 --> 01:01:05.456
And it wants your son.

01:01:05.657 --> 01:01:08.525
That's a dangerous situation
for someone who's close to death-

01:01:08.728 --> 01:01:09.956
He's not.

01:01:10.563 --> 01:01:16.023
And I'm as hopeful as you,
but tell me, have you not...

01:01:16.802 --> 01:01:19.236
...felt something strange here?

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:25.643
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:01:25.845 --> 01:01:29.680
I appreciate the concern, but this is
not the type of help we need right now.

01:01:29.883 --> 01:01:31.816
I'd like you to leave.

01:01:32.318 --> 01:01:33.841
Of course.

01:01:40.992 --> 01:01:42.789
You're not alone.

01:03:43.452 --> 01:03:45.283
Peter?

01:03:54.462 --> 01:03:55.894
Matt?

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:36.097
You're kidding.

01:04:37.606 --> 01:04:39.234
Hello!

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:41.103
Anybody home?

01:04:41.311 --> 01:04:42.676
All the lights are on!

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:47.274
Why are all the lights on?

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:50.379
Ridiculous.

01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:54.379
Everybody in this house is sleeping...

01:04:54.623 --> 01:04:57.216
...with the lights on
and I wanna know why!

01:04:57.426 --> 01:04:59.451
He's been drinking.

01:05:01.296 --> 01:05:03.958
Why don't we just build a fire
and throw money into it?

01:05:04.666 --> 01:05:05.633
It's okay.

01:05:05.834 --> 01:05:08.463
I gotta pay a mortgage,
I'm now paying rent.

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:10.399
Here's another one.

01:05:10.974 --> 01:05:12.702
God.

01:05:13.008 --> 01:05:17.102
Every single room has got a light on!

01:05:30.327 --> 01:05:32.624
Here. Here we go.

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:35.228
Sleep in the dark.

01:05:46.975 --> 01:05:48.567
There we go.

01:05:48.777 --> 01:05:50.802
Lights out.

01:05:54.516 --> 01:05:56.348
There we go.

01:05:56.986 --> 01:05:58.612
Yeah.

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:04.793
Peter...

01:06:05.796 --> 01:06:09.288
...that was a cruel
and childish thing to do.

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:13.461
All you did was scare everybody
in this house.

01:06:15.570 --> 01:06:18.335
Don't. Don't. Don't.

01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:26.640
Your family needs your strength,
not your self-pity.

01:06:28.919 --> 01:06:33.219
You get drunk again, don't come home.

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:39.155
Matt?

01:07:52.002 --> 01:07:52.969
Okay.

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:09.914
I'm so sorry.
I just didn't know who else to call.

01:08:10.420 --> 01:08:11.546
It's all right.

01:08:11.754 --> 01:08:15.691
- Are you sure you're feeling up to this?
- Well, put it this way, I'm...

01:08:16.060 --> 01:08:19.156
I'm exactly the right state of being...

01:08:19.365 --> 01:08:20.923
...to traffic with ghosts.

01:08:26.471 --> 01:08:28.133
What is that?

01:08:28.774 --> 01:08:30.765
Magnets. Iron magnets.

01:08:30.975 --> 01:08:32.305
Iron defends from evil.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:37.178
So it's no accident
that prisons have iron bars...

01:08:37.381 --> 01:08:41.580
...to not merely contain the body,
but the evil that may lurk within it.

01:08:50.328 --> 01:08:52.591
- What are you looking for?
- Where he died.

01:08:54.466 --> 01:08:58.402
Sometimes when death is violent
or filled with anger...

01:08:58.603 --> 01:09:04.437
...or fear or any strong emotion...

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:08.037
...it's as if the spirit doesn't pass on.

01:09:11.482 --> 01:09:16.286
That's why we cover mirrors,
light candles, open the shades...

01:09:16.490 --> 01:09:18.979
...so that they may find their way out.

01:09:19.325 --> 01:09:25.229
So a house with a trapped soul
is not so much haunted...

01:09:26.598 --> 01:09:29.158
...as it is possessed.

01:09:36.575 --> 01:09:38.872
What's down there?

01:09:39.911 --> 01:09:43.643
Matt's bedroom.
It's where they used to...

01:09:45.884 --> 01:09:48.115
Keep the children upstairs.

01:09:59.563 --> 01:10:00.690
Yeah.

01:10:00.898 --> 01:10:01.957
He's here.

01:10:02.167 --> 01:10:03.759
Do you see him, Matt?

01:10:06.136 --> 01:10:07.729
I don't see anything.

01:10:07.939 --> 01:10:11.536
That's because you're strong, you're
healthy. You shouldn't see anything.

01:10:43.777 --> 01:10:46.211
So this is where you're trapped.

01:10:48.648 --> 01:10:50.375
Don't worry.

01:10:51.249 --> 01:10:54.218
Whatever you may have done,
we're not here to punish you...

01:10:56.287 --> 01:10:58.654
...only to free you.

01:10:59.191 --> 01:11:01.090
Like a bird...

01:11:01.759 --> 01:11:04.026
...caught in a room.

01:11:17.245 --> 01:11:19.474
There must be another way.

01:11:19.713 --> 01:11:21.441
Perhaps the other side of that wall.

01:11:25.685 --> 01:11:29.644
I have to get his remains
out of the house.

01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:51.266
Stop it!

01:13:25.306 --> 01:13:26.535
It stopped.

01:13:45.259 --> 01:13:46.749
Will Matt be all right now?

01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.121
Yeah.

01:13:48.329 --> 01:13:50.092
The house is quiet and at peace.

01:13:50.731 --> 01:13:54.726
But I should warn you that sometimes
for a day or so after...

01:13:55.805 --> 01:14:00.708
...strange events, much like aftershocks
from an earthquake.

01:14:01.010 --> 01:14:03.707
But don't be alarmed...

01:14:04.181 --> 01:14:06.476
...it will pass,
within a day or two at the most.

01:14:17.459 --> 01:14:18.426
- Okay.
- All right.

01:14:20.896 --> 01:14:22.227
Thank you.

01:14:22.764 --> 01:14:24.494
It's okay.

01:14:26.802 --> 01:14:30.739
I wish I could say
it was my pleasure, but...

01:14:34.842 --> 01:14:36.173
You gonna be okay to drive?

01:14:36.377 --> 01:14:38.811
We're all in God's hands.

01:15:10.146 --> 01:15:12.614
<i>It's only five more sleeps
till parents' day.</i>

01:15:12.815 --> 01:15:14.782
<i>I can't wait.
I got a lot to show you, Dad.</i>

01:15:14.983 --> 01:15:17.009
<i>You'll see
how I shoot the bow and arrow...</i>

01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:21.452
<i>...and how far I can swim
and they're having a father-son race.</i>

01:15:21.657 --> 01:15:22.681
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

01:15:22.892 --> 01:15:25.987
<i>I bet you and me,
we beat all the others...</i>

01:15:26.196 --> 01:15:29.458
<i>...unless you're too old
and broke down.</i>

01:15:29.663 --> 01:15:33.259
<i>Okay, well, I better go. Bye, Dad.</i>

01:15:36.271 --> 01:15:39.434
All right,
whatever was here is gone now.

01:15:39.641 --> 01:15:41.939
Now, we've all had
some really bad nights.

01:15:58.361 --> 01:15:59.623
Stay here.

01:16:03.299 --> 01:16:04.596
Oh, my God.

01:16:04.801 --> 01:16:06.963
Oh, my- Oh, my-

01:16:08.172 --> 01:16:10.766
Oh, my God.
What have you done to yourself?

01:16:15.512 --> 01:16:19.039
All right, I'm gonna follow them. When
I get back, we're getting out of here.

01:18:14.499 --> 01:18:16.329
Sir?

01:18:17.367 --> 01:18:20.200
They'll be after you now.

01:18:20.404 --> 01:18:21.837
Get out.

01:19:00.045 --> 01:19:01.205
Somebody help me!

01:19:11.121 --> 01:19:15.387
Please! Somebody help me!

01:20:12.650 --> 01:20:13.948
Where's Matt?

01:20:14.153 --> 01:20:15.642
He's at the hospital.

01:20:15.854 --> 01:20:19.051
The doctors are gonna
take care of him, okay?

01:21:08.407 --> 01:21:10.967
<i>Hi. We're not home right now,
so please leave a message.</i>

01:21:11.176 --> 01:21:12.404
<i>Thanks.</i>

01:21:14.113 --> 01:21:16.584
I made a terrible mistake.

01:21:16.785 --> 01:21:20.118
Aickman didn't remove their eyelids
to make the dead see...

01:21:20.322 --> 01:21:22.256
...but to make them unseen.

01:21:22.457 --> 01:21:24.789
So all those missing bodies...

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:28.922
...all those poor souls in torment,
they're still there. They're in the house.

01:21:29.464 --> 01:21:33.023
<i>But the boy wasn't evil.</i>

01:21:33.266 --> 01:21:35.030
<i>He was trying to free them.</i>

01:21:35.235 --> 01:21:36.533
<i>And I removed him.</i>

01:21:39.105 --> 01:21:41.267
<i>Now all that's left is their rage.</i>

01:21:41.809 --> 01:21:43.208
You must get out now.

01:21:45.246 --> 01:21:46.804
<i>Get out now.</i>

01:22:27.188 --> 01:22:28.746
I'm sorry.

01:22:30.457 --> 01:22:33.426
It's okay. You're here now.
That's all that matters.

01:22:37.432 --> 01:22:40.298
He's sedated and comfortable.

01:22:40.901 --> 01:22:42.301
We ran his panels.

01:22:43.338 --> 01:22:45.272
I'm afraid it's not good news.

01:22:45.473 --> 01:22:47.168
His cell count is worse than before.

01:22:47.576 --> 01:22:50.841
The treatment has, frankly,
had no effect.

01:22:53.814 --> 01:22:55.542
How long do you think he has?

01:22:55.748 --> 01:22:58.650
With these numbers,
I don't know what's keeping him alive.

01:22:58.853 --> 01:23:00.752
He could go tonight.

01:23:00.954 --> 01:23:03.651
There's really no way of saying for sure.

01:23:05.893 --> 01:23:07.485
Then can we see him?

01:23:08.331 --> 01:23:10.162
Of course.

01:23:11.934 --> 01:23:13.094
To fight.

01:23:13.303 --> 01:23:15.133
<i>One bright day
In the middle of the night</i>

01:23:15.338 --> 01:23:17.364
<i>Two dead boys got up to fight</i>

01:23:17.573 --> 01:23:18.836
He couldn't have gotten far.

01:23:19.042 --> 01:23:21.567
<i>- One bright day in the middle-
- Hi, this is Dr. Brooks.</i>

01:23:21.775 --> 01:23:23.539
Get me security right away, please.

01:23:23.745 --> 01:23:25.372
<i>Two dead boys got up to fight</i>

01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:26.945
<i>One bright day
In the middle of the night</i>

01:23:27.148 --> 01:23:29.480
<i>Two dead boys got up to fight</i>

01:23:38.059 --> 01:23:39.755
Matt?

01:23:41.364 --> 01:23:43.491
Matt?

01:23:43.833 --> 01:23:45.562
Matt.

01:24:00.515 --> 01:24:01.538
Come over. Come here.

01:24:03.953 --> 01:24:05.785
We're gonna play
hide-and-seek now, okay?

01:24:05.989 --> 01:24:07.616
Okay, go.

01:24:10.894 --> 01:24:13.386
- We have to get out of here. Come on.
- What's going on?

01:24:13.597 --> 01:24:15.360
We have to go. We have to-

01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:17.455
Matt. Matt, no.

01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:18.861
Matt, no. No.

01:24:25.808 --> 01:24:27.469
- Get out.
- Matt.

01:24:27.677 --> 01:24:29.372
Get out.

01:24:29.578 --> 01:24:32.376
Matt. No. Matt.

01:24:32.581 --> 01:24:35.278
Get out. Whatever you do,
do not let them put out the fire.

01:24:35.485 --> 01:24:37.384
- What about you?
- I'm already dead.

01:24:38.988 --> 01:24:42.288
- Matt, come out. Matt.
- Matt.

01:24:45.593 --> 01:24:47.356
We'll find him.

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:04.984
Mom. Dad.

01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:06.925
Where's Matt?

01:29:07.126 --> 01:29:09.321
- He's inside.
- I don't understand.

01:29:09.529 --> 01:29:12.157
- I thought you said it was over.
- Matt's trying to end it.

01:29:12.365 --> 01:29:13.389
- I gotta get in.
- Ma'am.

01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:16.592
No, you gotta let me in there.
I have to get my son.

01:29:16.803 --> 01:29:19.704
- Fire.
- Please let me go. Please.

01:29:19.906 --> 01:29:21.737
To unbind the spirits.

01:29:46.100 --> 01:29:47.966
What are we waiting for? Come on!

01:29:48.168 --> 01:29:49.898
Matt!

01:30:03.249 --> 01:30:05.274
Oh, my God.

01:30:05.853 --> 01:30:07.820
Okay.

01:30:10.791 --> 01:30:12.451
All right.

01:30:13.459 --> 01:30:16.952
I'm here. I'm here.

01:30:40.989 --> 01:30:42.513
The Lord is my shepherd.

01:30:42.724 --> 01:30:44.352
I shall not want.

01:30:44.592 --> 01:30:47.024
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

01:30:47.927 --> 01:30:50.294
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

01:30:51.131 --> 01:30:53.428
He restoreth my soul.

01:30:53.634 --> 01:30:55.864
He leadeth me
in the path of righteousness.

01:31:01.041 --> 01:31:03.305
He helped my son.

01:31:27.701 --> 01:31:32.265
We're here. We're here. We're here.

01:31:46.488 --> 01:31:48.182
Matt.

01:31:54.195 --> 01:31:55.992
Be careful.

01:31:58.400 --> 01:31:59.924
Come on, wake up.

01:32:00.535 --> 01:32:01.763
Wake up.

01:32:01.971 --> 01:32:04.165
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be okay.

01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:17.913
No. Hold on.

01:32:18.118 --> 01:32:19.915
Wake up.

01:32:32.268 --> 01:32:34.965
Come on, Matty.
Come on, Matty, breathe.

01:32:37.206 --> 01:32:39.264
I love you.

01:32:51.586 --> 01:32:53.680
<i>Wake up, Matt.</i>

01:32:58.293 --> 01:33:00.125
<i>I just love you so much.</i>

01:33:02.598 --> 01:33:04.156
<i>Come on, Matty, wake up.</i>

01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:07.829
Please, come on, honey.

01:33:09.337 --> 01:33:10.894
<i>Come on.</i>

01:33:16.978 --> 01:33:19.105
You'll be all right.

01:33:36.632 --> 01:33:38.122
Hey.

01:33:49.011 --> 01:33:51.036
He's okay.

01:34:09.898 --> 01:34:13.527
<i>I don't really care
if anybody believes me or not.</i>

01:34:14.369 --> 01:34:16.602
<i>I know what happened.</i>

01:34:16.807 --> 01:34:21.801
<i>Doctors and nurses know
and my family knows.</i>

01:34:23.614 --> 01:34:26.640
<i>And my son is alive...</i>

01:34:27.952 --> 01:34:29.942
<i>...and well.</i>

01:34:30.921 --> 01:34:33.047
<i>That's all that matters.</i>

01:34:34.390 --> 01:34:37.622
<i>They say that God works
in mysterious ways.</i>

01:34:38.628 --> 01:34:42.394
<i>They just don't always tell you
how mysterious those ways can be.</i>

01:34:43.600 --> 01:34:45.693
<i>Consider yourself warned.</i>
