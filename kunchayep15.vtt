00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Regarding Jiu, don't worry.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.000
The poison of orchid will slowly get into the blood

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.000
Eventually he coughs up blood and dies. 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.000
And where is he?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.000
Jiu…Jiu is dead.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Even if I announce the marriage, 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.000
he will know one day that you have poison that is used to kill people.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
what are you going to do?

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.000
Jia and I have already thought about how it should end.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.000
I have a solution.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Tomorrow before the ceremony starts, we have to stop Mr. Ma.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Kill him before he arrives.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.000
Mr. Ma has absolutely no way of exposing Mr. Tian.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Li. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I love you, Tian.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Everything must end today.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Before paying respect, fill up with the tea.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Wait.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Do you see Nuan?

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.000
I see her walking towards the back of the house, Sir.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.000
Thanks. 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
What is Mr. Tian doing? Sneak up like that. 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000
What did he hide?

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
What? You said Tian hid something?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:21.000
I don't know what he is hiding. But it's suspicious.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
It must be something really important.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Good, take me there quickly. 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Let's go, Jia, or we won't be in time.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Oh, Sir.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Where have you been?

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
We...

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
I feel better now.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
So I go out for some fresh air.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000
What about the blood on your head?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000
Why do you have a wound?

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I'm not careful enough,

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
so I walked into the door and hit my head. 

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
You were stupid enough to walked into the door?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000
You think I'm so stupid that I will believe your lie?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Tell me now. 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Where have you been?

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Are you going to tell me?

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000
The blood on your head.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Is it your blood or whose blood?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Sir. 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000
If you want to hurt anyone, 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000
do it to me.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
What evil stuff have you done again, Li?

00:07:35.620 --> 00:07:36.620
For you, 
 

00:07:37.748 --> 00:07:39.748
it might be evil stuff. 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But for me, 

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000
it's what a mother has to do.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Father, what is this about?

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Father.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
If you have something, 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000
put it aside first.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Let's get through today. 

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000
I beg you. 

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000
It's almost the time. 

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
I think we better go.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Please, Father.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Where is the thing Tian hiding?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
I don't know.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
What? Why don't you wait to see until he finished hiding?

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000
I was in a hurry to tell you.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.000
Bitch. 

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Help find it. 

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Father, let's go.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.000
The ceremony is starting soon. 

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Have you found it?

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.000
No, Madam. 

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.000
Find it. 

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Perhaps this thing will help turn the tide.

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:53.000
Alright, Madam. 

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Big Brother.

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.000
Chun, Tong. 

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Big brother, are you okay?

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:12.000
It seems like you aren't feeling well?

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000
It's nothing. Mr. Song must be tired.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Should we start the ceremony now?

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
How can we start?

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Ma and Chan are not here yet.

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.000
But if we wait, it won't be an auspicious time.

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.000
Right, Big Brother. 

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.000
I think we don't need to wait for Ma.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
He never follows the rules and never be on time. 

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:50.000
If he doesn't see the importance of other people's time, 

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
why do we need to wait for someone like this?

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000
I agree with this.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000
So Ma will know that we are not satisfied with him either.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Did you find it?

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000
No, Madam. 

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.000
For today's meeting, 

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
I have something important to let everyone know.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Tian.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.000
I want to announce that 

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
I will arrange a wedding for Tian and Mud,

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000
and pass the leader title of the Five Dragons Association to him

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:06.000
in the next three days.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Would anyone oppose?

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Why are you in such a hurry, Big Brother?

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Hasn't Tian recently broken off the engagement with Lady Pin?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Oh, Chun.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Young people always like this.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Impatient.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Lovers can't wait, of course.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000
I think it's good.

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.000
After Tian gets married,

00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:39.000
you gives the leader title of the Five Dragons Association to him.

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000
So Tian can help you take care of your works.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Your health isn't quite good lately, is it?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Then I won't oppose this.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000
I think Tian is the most suitable one

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000
to inherit the position from you.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
He is diligent and kind to the workers.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000
From now on, I'll have to call you Mr. Tian as well. 

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Madam, I found it.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Come on, let me see it. 

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.000
This is…

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.000
If no one opposes, 

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
I will arrange a wedding for Tian and Mud,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.000
as well as passing the leader title of the Five Dragons Association to him

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
in the next three days.

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.000
No, you can't. 

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Mom. 

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Tian didn't deserve to be the head of the Five Dragons Association. 

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Can you stop causing trouble?

00:16:58.300 --> 00:16:59.000
What are you talking about?

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Right, Chan. 

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Why are you making a mess?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Take her out now. 

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Stop, No. Go away.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000
Nuan. 

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Tell them what you saw.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000
I saw Mr. Tian sneaking to hide something as if he has a secret.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.000
When I followed him, I found this, Sir.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Sleeping powder. 

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000
What did he hide?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
What is that letter?

00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:17.000
Nuan, give it to me.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Give it to me. / No, Mr. Yang.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.000
Mom. 

00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.000
Let me go. / Mr. Yang.

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.000
Mom. 

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.000
This letter was written by Jiu to Tian

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.000
making an appointment to run away with each other. 

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000
It clearly stated that they were lovers.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Nuan, let me go! / Mr. Yang.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000
Please come to meet me tomorrow. 

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:46.000
I'll tell you everything

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.000
and let's run away together. 

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.000
I love you, Tian. 

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Chan. 

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
What the hell are you talking about?

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000
What is this, Tian?

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Tian is a homosexual like Mr. Zhang.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000
How are you going to judge?

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000
In the past, Mr. Zhang was exposed that he was a homosexual.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000
You had expelled him from the association until he committed suicide.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.000
How about this time?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Are you going to let it go like this?

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Are you letting Tian become the head of the association?

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:39.000
Shut up, Chan. 

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:43.000
You made up the story because you wanted to steal the position for Yang.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
No one would believe the lie that you said.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000
What would you say?

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Tell me that it's not true.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:00.000
What Chan said was not true, say it. 

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Tian, Tian. 

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.100
Tell me. 

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
That the whole thing isn't true.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000
It's all a misunderstanding.

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Tell everyone.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
I'm sorry, father.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
What Aunt Chan said is true. 

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
I like men. 

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Tian.

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:09.000
It's the truth that I've been hiding all along.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Tian, stop. 

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.700
Yang.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000
In the past, I lived in fear.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
I'm embarrassed.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
It's like I have to lie to everyone all the time.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
But when I said it out,

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000
I've never been at ease like this before, Yang. 

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Tian.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.000
Bua,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.000
don't be sad.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Don't pity me.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:59.000
I don't need sympathy
or understanding from everyone.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000
I just want to be myself.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
I want to live my life the way I choose

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
in which everyone respects me.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Not too much.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Not too less. 

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Just as much as a person deserves.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
All these years, 

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000
I've always tried to hide the fact that I like men.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
But Aunt Chan found this letter in the end. 

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:41.000
Previously, 

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Our worker, Dong, knew this secret.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
So I had to kill him to cover this up. 

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
The tiny box that comes with the letter.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Huh?

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000
It's the poison I used to kill Dong.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000
Does this box contain poison?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Not true, Tian. What did you say?

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.000
Why are you lying? Huh?

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.000
Killing someone to keep secrets. You evil.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.000
That's not true. I don't believe it. 

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.000
Someone like you can't kill people. That's not true.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.000
Yes. 

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Tian definitely wouldn't do that, Father.

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
What is this?

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:28.000
This isn't true, right?

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Father.

00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:36.000
Sir. 

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.000
What did you do?

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Tian. 

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
You ruined the honor of the Song family

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
that we have accumulated.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
You're ruining our clan.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Father.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Father.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
I'm sorry

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
that I couldn't become the son that you and Mother expected me to be. 

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
But this child does the best job.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Are you crazy?

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.000
What did you do? Did you realize it?

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Tell me now that it's not true. It's not true.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Tian. 

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
What kind of duty are you doing?

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:58.000
You ungrateful child!

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:00.000
You ungrateful child!

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.000
Sir. 

00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.000
Father.

00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.000
Big Brother.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.000
Let go of me. 

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000
Father. 

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.000
Sir. 

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Sir. 

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
How is Mr. Song, doctor?

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
He's better now. 

00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.000
I'll prescribe medicine

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
but you must be careful not to let anything stress him. 

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Thanks. 

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.000
Why are you here?

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.000
Do you still dare to come in?

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
If you go inside, Mr. Song will be worse after seeing you.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:32.000
A homosexual

00:27:32.300 --> 00:27:34.000
and a killer. 

00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:37.000
You shameless.

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Mom.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Tian. 

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:28.000
Why are you doing this?

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
What do you mean?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
If you talk about Dong's death,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
It's because he knew my secret, 

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000
so I had to kill him.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000
I've told you everything.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000
You think I'll believe you?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000
You can lie to others, but not me.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
I grew up with you.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
I know what are you like. 

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000
You can't even kill an ant.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000
And that letter.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000
If you wanted to destroy that letter, why didn't you burn it?

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
You buried it and deliberately let Mom and Nuan see it, right?

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Yes. 

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
I want to end everything, Yang.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.000
About my secret

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:52.000
and Dong's death.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Someone must plead guilty. 

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.000
If I don’t admit it, 

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Mother must be punished.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Yang.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
I've made up my mind, Yang.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Could you please

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
take care of Father and Mother for me, okay?

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Promise me. 

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Promise me, Yang. 

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Madam. 

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.000
Madam. 

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Yang.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Can you leave us alone?

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:11.000
I want to talk to Mother.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Please. 

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Tian. 

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Why do you do this?

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Everything is about to end.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
I told you already that I would handle everything.

00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000
How are you going to handle it?

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000
You would let me take up the position.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Then after that, you would confess to Father.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
and you would commit suicide, right?

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
As a mother, 

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000
I'm willing to do anything for you. 

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
But I can't stand it, Mother.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
I couldn't see you dying for me. 

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Mother.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:23.000
What I did is the best for everyone.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000
At least everyone is still alive.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000
And if you miss me, 

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:39.000
you can still visit me in the prison.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000
What do you mean?

00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Tian. 

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Tian. 

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.000
We come to take Mr. Tian to the police station.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.000
No, you can't arrest my son.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:08.000
He did nothing wrong.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Tian, Tian. 

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.000
Tian. / Mother.

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:13.000
Listen to me. 

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Previously, I had already given evidence to the police.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:22.000
And today, 

00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.000
I want to surrender.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.000
No, no. 

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000
No, you can't take my son.

00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.000
Tian. 

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Mother

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:36.000
Please listen to me.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Please don't do this.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Don't make everything I sacrifice 

00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.000
all in vain.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Tian. 

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Take me. 

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.000
No, no. 

00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:55.000
No, you can't take my son.

00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.000
Please take me. 

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.000
Take him. / Tian!

00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.000
Tian! Tian!

00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:00.100
Don't. No!

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000
No. Let him go. 

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:06.000
No! No!

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.000
No, let go of my son. 

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:09.000
Please let him go, Madam. 

00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:11.000
Let go of him. 

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:12.100
Let go of my son. 

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000
He did nothing wrong.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Let go of him. 

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:18.000
It was my fault. Take me.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:21.000
Why do you arrest my son? He did nothing wrong.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.000
Let him go. 

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
I was at fault. I was wrong. 

00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:28.000
Take me. Take me. I was at fault. 

00:34:28.300 --> 00:34:29.000
My son did nothing wrong.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Why did you take him? He's done nothing wrong. Let him go.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Let him go. 

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Tian! Tian!

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Tian!

00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.000
Tian!

00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:44.000
Tian!

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Tian!

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Tian!

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Tian!

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000
Tian.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
It's my fault. 

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Mr. Tian confessed that he killed Dong.

00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.000
How long will he be imprisoned?

00:35:53.300 --> 00:35:54.000
Will he be executed?

00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.000
I don't know.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
But they probably can't just find a way to help him out and act as if nothing happened.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
He is a homosexual and a murderer.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Ma must use this excuse to steal the leader title of the association for sure.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000
And he has the right to do so as well.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
The situation has changed now. What are you going to do?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Madam. 

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000
What?

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000
The box of beetle orchid that Mr. Tian hid along with the letter.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
At first, I thought that he knew about our orchid, 

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
so he made fake evidence to plead guilty.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:10.000
But it really has beetle orchid inside.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Where did Tian get the beetle orchid from?

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Mr. Tian was arrested by the police.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.000
I felt sorry for him.

00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Why would you pity him?

00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.000
This is a consequence from what he did. 

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
What should we do next?

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
We need to strike while the iron is hot.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Madam, Madam. 

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Sir. 

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Your tea, Sir. 

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Why

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
does Tian's life has to go through something like this?

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
It's probably because of karma

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000
that I did to Zhang.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000
He cursed me

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000
to know his suffering

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000
like he faced in the past. 

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
What will you do next?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Sir, shall I call Bao for you. 

00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:06.000
So you can discuss how to help Tian.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Or shall we let Bao follow to watch Mr. Tian at the police station?

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000
No, no. 

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000
Don't do anything.

00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Why, sir?

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Do you really believe that Tian killed Dong?

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:21.800
No. 

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
I don't believe it. 

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:29.000
I did not believe that someone like Tian could kill anyone.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.000
But...

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.000
But why?

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
But you're angry with him that he likes men, right?

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Can this matter erase his goodness,

00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.000
and your father and son relationship?

00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:50.000
Sir. 

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Please. Please help Tian, Sir.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Now the authorities are interfering with this issue. 

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
We have to think carefully before taking action.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000
If there is a mistake, 

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
it can destroy many things.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Sir, at that time, 

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
there was a tragedy of Mr. Zhang once. 

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:20.000
This time, don't let things like that happen again with Tian.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Please, Sir. 

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Please help Tian. Please.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
I beg you. 

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
You need to help him. 

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Bua. 

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000
You need to help him. I beg you. 

00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:37.000
Sir. 

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Regarding the head title of the Five Dragons Association, 

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.000
you must give it to my son, Yang. 

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
What would you say, Sir?

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Mom, what happened?

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Yang, take your mother out now.

00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:07.000
No. 

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Unless you gives this position to my son.

00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.000
But it's not the time to talk about it now, Mom.

00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:14.000
I'm doing it for you.

00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:15.000
Let's go

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Or...

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:26.000
You still haven't pass the title to him because you want to buy the time to help Tian.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
He only does shameful things.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:34.000
He's a homosexual and a murderer.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Are you still helping him to get this position?

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Madam, please.

00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:45.000
Can't you see that Mr. Song is sick? Please stop. 

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Do you dare to give me that attitude?

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:48.000
Enough!

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Madam, 

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
The sleeping powder is gone.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Tian may switch this thing with orchid dust. 

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Then Mr. Ma now …

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Let's go.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000
Move back. 

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000
What is this?

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Mr. Ma.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000
Give him to me.

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.000
I'll deal with him and his parents.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
I can't follow your order. 

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Don't panic.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Soon you're also going to die.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Look at me. 

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Your mom was the one who did this to me. 

00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:52.000
You and your family needs to pay.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Split up.

00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:06.000
Don't let anyone escape.

00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000
The rest follow me. 

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Come here.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Go! Get up.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:14.000
Come here.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:18.000
You and your family must pay.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000
What should we do, Madam?

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000
We better run away from here.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Come here.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Mr. Tian.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Song!

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Song!

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Song!

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Song!

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Go! 

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Mr. Tian.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000
You're finally here.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Ma. 

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000
What are you doing?

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Let go of Tian now. 

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Mr. Ma isn't dead yet.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:32.800
He caught Mr. Tian.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I'm going to help him. 

00:45:34.300 --> 00:45:35.000
Calm down. 

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000
If we show up now, Tian will be in danger. 

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Ma. 

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000
What the hell are you doing?

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Why do you come here with these Japanese soldiers?

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Are you working with them now?

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
You know what they did in mainland. 

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Chun, Chun. 

00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Chun, Chun. 

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Ma!

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Why did you shoot him?

00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:08.000
If you don't want to die like him, drop the weapon

00:46:08.300 --> 00:46:09.000
and get down on your knees.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Quickly. 

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Ma.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
How can you do this?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000
How can you kill your brothers?

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Brothers?

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Do you still dare to use this word?

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000
This word 

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:39.000
is worth nothing

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
since you sent Li, your wife, to kill me. 

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Look at me. 

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000
I lost my fingers, my eye.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000
I barely survived.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
This is it?

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Did brothers do this to each other?

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Where are Li and her servant?

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Where are they?

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:21.000
You won't tell me?

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000
I'll kill all of you.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Then I'll kill them later. Kill them.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
There are a lot of soldiers. 

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
We can't find a way to fight them.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Hey!

00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.000
Sir, Sir. 

00:48:57.300 --> 00:48:58.000
Mom, Mom. 

00:48:58.200 --> 00:48:59.000
Please take it easy. Please. 

00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:02.000
Let's discuss calmly. 

00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Calmly?

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:14.000
Mom!

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Mom!

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Ma.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Yang!

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Yang!

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:29.000
Get this. / Mr. Song.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000
Yang, baby. 

00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:35.000
Stop. Yang. / Let go of me!

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.000
Yang.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Mom!

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.000
Yang! Don't hurt him. 

00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.000
Yang.

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:40.000
Yang.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Ma!

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Yang.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Are you angry that I slapped your wife?

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000
But in fact, 

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000
you should be grateful

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000
if you know what she has done to you

00:50:01.300 --> 00:50:03.000
and your family.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000
She's the one who has sent news 

00:50:21.800 --> 00:50:24.000
and reported everything about the Song family to me.

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Not true. 

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
That's not true. That's not true. 

00:50:30.300 --> 00:50:31.000
That's not true. 

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.000
That's not true. 

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Sir, please. Don't do it. 

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.000
Sir, Sir. 

00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.000
Please don't. 

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.000
Mom!

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000
Stop!

00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000
If it wasn't true,

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
how would I know about Dong's death and bring the police to the temple?

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:06.000
And another thing, 

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000
she was the one who informed me where Tian went to.

00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:14.000
That's why I was able to let my subordinates follow to kill him.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
But when I didn't succeed, 

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:24.000
she went to search for Tian's secret to tell me. 

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Really?

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000
I'm sorry, Sir. 

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:11.000
I'm so sorry. 

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Why did you do this?

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:19.000
I don't think

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:23.000
the situation will get out of hand like this. 

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:28.000
I just want my child

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000
to be loved and receive attention like Tian.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000
I don't think

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000
that what I have done

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000
will bring disaster to everyone in the Song family.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000
I was wrong, I'm really sorry.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000
I'm sorry

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.000
that I caused troubles to everyone, Sir.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
I'm greedy.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:18.000
I want my son to own everything.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
I want him to have power.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
I didn't think it through. 

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
I'm such a stupid mother. 

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
I'm sorry, my baby. 

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Let go of me!

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.000
I know that.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Don't apologize. 

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
I know you did everything for me. 

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Sir. 

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:34.000
Mr. Ma. 

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Don't hurt my son. Don't hurt him, please. 

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.000
If you want to do, hurt me instead. 

00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:44.000
You can kill me. 

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
You can kill me. 

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Let my son go, please. 

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Let my son go, please. 

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:52.000
Let go of him. 

00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:53.000
Please, Sir. 

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Let go of him. 

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000
No.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Don't do it. 

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:05.000
I beg you. 

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Alright. 

00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:09.000
Please stop. 

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:13.000
No!

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:14.000
No!

00:55:14.300 --> 00:55:15.000
Mom!

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000
No!

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Don't hurt my mother!

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.000
Yang!

00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Ma!

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Yang!

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Yang!

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Stop! Stop! 

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Stop it!

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Stop, Ma.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Ma.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Ma!

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Ma!

00:56:36.500 --> 00:56:37.000
I'm here.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Look at me. 

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Look at me. 

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
You want to take revenge? Attack me. 

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Don't hurt others. 

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
I'm here. Go on. 

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
It's not everyone's fault.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.000
The situation comes to this

00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:05.000
because of me alone. 

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.000
I didn't take good care of them.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.000
I didn't care about them.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
The love I have for them is not good enough.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
That's why they're doing this. 

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000
If I love and care enough, 

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000
they wouldn't do this.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:37.000
Chan. 

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Yang.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.000
I'm sorry.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Chan. 

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:58.000
I'm sorry.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
That's not true, Sir. 

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:04.000
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
I'm the one who did it.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:09.000
I'm the one who did it, Sir. 

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.000
I'm the one who did it.

00:58:11.300 --> 00:58:13.000
That's not true.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:25.000
The wind is blowing directly towards Mr. Ma and the Japanese soldiers,

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000
but it may be hit Mr. Tian and Mr. Song too. 

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000
The touching moment is over. 

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.000
Father.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000
It's time for you to make amends

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
for what you did to me. 

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000
I will kill your whole family.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000
I will kill you all. 

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Which one should I kill first?

00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000
No, Ma. 

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Kill me only. 

00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.000
Kill me only. 

00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:02.000
Go ahead!

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000
This bitch. 

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000
No. 

00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Ma, don't. 

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:37.000
You!

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Or you!

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.000
All of you must die.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Except Tian.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
I'll keep him

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.000
until I find Li. 

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Then I will kill him in front of his mother.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Chan. 

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Madam. 

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Everyone, down!

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Let's go, Madam. 

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.000
Hey!

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Let's go. Let’s get out of here quickly.

01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.000
Madam. / Madam Chan. 

01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:41.800
Let's go. 

01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:42.300
Mom.

01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:43.000
Sir. / Let's go, Tian.

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:44.000
Let's go. 

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:45.000
Hurry up. 

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000
How are you, Madam?

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Are you alright?

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.000
Sir. 

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.000
Are you okay, Tian?

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Come in quicky!

01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.000
Tian, Yang. 

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Nuan!

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Nuan!

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000
Nuan. / Let's go now. We don't have time.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Mom! We don't have time. 

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Bua, get out. 

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Go.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Li, Yang, take everyone out to the back. Hurry.

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Okay, go. 

01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:35.000
Sir. 

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Let's go. Tian. 

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:40.000
Quickly. 

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Father.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Where are you going, Big Brother?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000
Ma. 

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Mr. Yang. / Yang. 

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Yang. 

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:28.000
Jia. 

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
This way. 

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.000
Are you alright, Jia?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Chan. 

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Are you okay?

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Get up. 

01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.000
Madam, 

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
Mr. Tian and Mr. Song haven't followed us yet. 

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Yang, take your mother and get out of here. 

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:07.000
I will help them out.

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.000
Go.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Jia, let's go. 

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Madam, be careful.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000
Yang, let's go.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000
These people died from poisoning.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000
If I didn't escape in time, 

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
my life would have ended like this. 

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Don't hurt Mr. Tian. 

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Your mother is really evil. 

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.000
Where is she now?

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
You won't tell me?

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
You won't tell me where she is?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Tian, Tian. 

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000
Tian, Tian. 

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Li. 

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.000
You are poisoned by beetle orchid. 

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
If you don't get the antidote, you'll die.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
This is the antidote.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000
If you don't want to die,

01:06:02.300 --> 01:06:04.000
free Mr. Song and Mr. Tian.

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:14.000
Why do I have to do that?

01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:16.000
When the antidote is in your hand, 

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
I just have to kill you and take it.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Catch her. 

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Alright. 

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Jiu. 

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Jiu. 

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
You're not dead yet?

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Arrest him. 

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Mother.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.000
Li, be careful!

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Li!

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Get up. 

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Jiu. 

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Let go of me. 

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Are you okay?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000
I'm fine. 

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:10.000
Please take care of Mr. Song and Mr. Tian, Madam.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000
Sir. 

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Tian. 

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
You're still alive. 

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I'm here to help you. You'll be alright. 

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000
They are over there. 

01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000
Madam, they are here. 

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:01.000
We better run away.

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.000
Mr. Ma needs an antidote anyway. 

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:06.000
He wouldn't dare to do anything to Mr. Song and Mr. Tian.

01:09:06.200 --> 01:09:07.000
Right.

01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:10.000
Li, get out of here. Don't worry about me.

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:11.000
Not, Sir. Just a little bit more.

01:09:11.300 --> 01:09:13.000
Jiu, take Mother and Aunt Jia out of here. 

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:15.000
Tian, but...

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Please take care of Mother and Aunt Jia for me. 

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:39.000
Go. 

01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Don't worry, Tian.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
I'll come back to help you.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Madam, let's go. 

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:46.600
Sir. 

01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.000
Go. Li. Hurry!

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:49.000
Sir. / Hurry, Madam. 

01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:49.800
Let's go, Madam. / Run!

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Jia, take Madam Li. 

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:52.000
Yes, Sir. 

01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.000
Don't worry.

01:09:53.300 --> 01:09:55.000
He doesn't dare to hurt me. Go!

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Mr. Ma was poisoned by the beetle orchid and is still waiting for the antidote from me. 

01:10:50.300 --> 01:10:53.000
And do you really have an antidote?

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.000
If I could be the son that you and Mother hoped for, 

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:10.000
everything wouldn't be like this, right?

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.000
Li will exchange the antidote for the hostages.

01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:16.000
Wait and see the end of those who dared to be enemies against me.
