1
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:10,125
I really want a chopping knife.

2
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:11,708
What do you want it for?

3
00:01:11,791 --> 00:01:13,125
To cut off this post.

4
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,041
It interferes with our love.

5
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:22,875
Do you know

6
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,250
what will kill you?

7
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,000
What is it?

8
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,416
Your sweet addiction.

9
00:01:32,833 --> 00:01:34,541
I'm a sweet guy.

10
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:40,625
Hello, Dad Johnny.

11
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:41,833
I'm not your dad.

12
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,708
I bought you grilled chicken.

13
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:46,750
Mam.

14
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:48,791
Get on.

15
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,833
It runs out of gas.

16
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,791
And a spark plug failed.

17
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,208
Pol…

18
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,125
I love you so much.

19
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,041
I love you more, Mam.

20
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,250
Go get her.

21
00:03:45,333 --> 00:03:46,666
Are you serious?

22
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,083
I will.

23
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,625
What a dirty trick.

24
00:03:58,916 --> 00:03:59,750
Mam!

25
00:03:59,833 --> 00:04:01,083
Kick him hard.

26
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,041
Kick him hard.

27
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:09,750
Knee him!

28
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,291
And now freestyle.

29
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,000
You have a good hip, huh?

30
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,416
What's the problem?

31
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,333
What the hell?

32
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:44,958
Piss off, you lame fighter.

33
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,583
And you just nurture your chicken.

34
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,708
He's flirting with your niece.

35
00:04:48,958 --> 00:04:51,208
What? They're just sparring.

36
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,000
Sparring my ass.

37
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:56,958
Mam, get in the house.

38
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,500
Why are you still looking at my daughter?

39
00:05:09,375 --> 00:05:10,208
Get out!

40
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:11,708
I really love her.

41
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,416
Dad Johnny.

42
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,791
Don't call me dad, I'm not your father.

43
00:05:18,125 --> 00:05:19,500
Daddy my ass.

44
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:22,541
A poor guy like you

45
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,833
can never take care of my daughter.

46
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,541
You always call me a poor.

47
00:05:26,625 --> 00:05:28,250
Yes, I know I am.

48
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,583
How rich do I have to be to be her man?

49
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,291
Impossibly rich!

50
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,416
All right.

51
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,625
I'll prove to you

52
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,916
that I'm not just a loser

53
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,666
or a lame fighter.

54
00:05:46,875 --> 00:05:49,083
My love is worth more than money.

55
00:06:01,375 --> 00:06:02,208
Mam.

56
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:03,791
What now?

57
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:04,833
Wait for me.

58
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:13,791
SIX MONTHS LATER

59
00:07:15,375 --> 00:07:17,125
Come on, everyone.

60
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:21,583
Let's make merit at Koak E-Gerng village.

61
00:07:29,958 --> 00:07:31,250
Coming up next,

62
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,500
Luang Por Yhong
will light the Talai skyrocket.

63
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,666
A symbol of blessing to our Koak E-Gerng.

64
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:49,916
Talai exploded!

65
00:07:50,333 --> 00:07:51,833
Run for your life!

66
00:07:52,083 --> 00:07:53,166
Run!

67
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,958
Run, folks. Run! Get outta here!

68
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:02,833
Hey, Suer.

69
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,166
Luang Por!

70
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,458
I can't feel my legs!

71
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,000
It's huge.

72
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:30,583
Talai is launched, folks.

73
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,583
Long live Koak E-Gerng!

74
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,875
How come is Mam like that?

75
00:09:10,958 --> 00:09:12,625
She looks miserable.

76
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:13,583
Yeah.

77
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:30,041
Yes?

78
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,208
How are you, son? Will you come home?

79
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,625
Mom, I don't think I can.

80
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:38,083
I'm overwhelmed with work.

81
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:42,041
Mom, I gotta hang up. My hands are in use.

82
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,166
Talk to you later. Yes.

83
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,333
Your turn, call him.

84
00:09:58,458 --> 00:09:59,291
Yes, Dad.

85
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:00,666
Pol.

86
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,625
What are you doing?

87
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,791
Why do you call again?
Are you not with Mom?

88
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,458
She's with me every night.

89
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:12,541
She usually pokes me, wants more babies.

90
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,875
Stop fooling around.
I'll have you castrated.

91
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,625
Busy with work is good.
Save up more money.

92
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:23,416
You can come home during Songkran.

93
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
No need to hurry back, all right?

94
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,000
Yes, Dad.

95
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:35,333
What now, Uncle Waeng?

96
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:37,041
Hello, my beloved nephew.

97
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,875
You have a free talk plan or what?

98
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,875
No, I only have a free love plan.

99
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,333
Love you, darling.

100
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,291
Hey, that's your nephew.

101
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:48,333
I'm just joking.

102
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,791
Is that right?

103
00:10:50,916 --> 00:10:51,875
-Will you come?
-No.

104
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,291
Oh, busy?

105
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:54,541
All right then.

106
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,708
Let me talk to my friend.

107
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:58,541
Dude.

108
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,125
I miss you.

109
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:01,833
You don't need to come during Songkran.

110
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:04,750
I'll visit you during Buddhist lent.

111
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:07,500
Show me some nice Bangkok girls.

112
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,541
Bangkok girls my ass.

113
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,916
Your wife is here.

114
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:12,625
I'll whoop your ass.

115
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:13,791
I gotta go.

116
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:14,750
Okay.

117
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:16,000
Yes.

118
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:18,750
Sarakam to Koak E-Gerng! Want a ride?

119
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:19,750
Yes.

120
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:21,583
Come on, hop on.

121
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:24,500
Sarakam to Koak E-Gerng!

122
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:28,708
Johnny.

123
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,458
Are you drunk? Sober yet?

124
00:11:30,583 --> 00:11:31,458
I am.

125
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,083
We're here.

126
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:39,625
Stop.

127
00:11:42,666 --> 00:11:44,333
I'm in a hurry.

128
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,208
Auntie, you dropped something.
Don't you want it?

129
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,791
Thanks, young man.

130
00:11:48,875 --> 00:11:50,875
I almost lost my dinner.

131
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,583
Let's go!

132
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:03,958
This is a sandalwood glass

133
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:06,666
This is a Murraya exotica bowl

134
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:12,416
May you live happily
After you get married

135
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:15,583
May your essence in the orchard rush back

136
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,541
May your essence in the paddies rush back

137
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:23,958
May your essence
In the abdomen slowly come up

138
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,166
Today is the wedding day
Of a farang couple

139
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,041
The first Isaan-born
Farang couple in the country

140
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:35,333
Love you, Koak E-Gerng

141
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,583
Love you, Koak E-Gerng

142
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:43,833
May your essence…

143
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:54,500
Oh, your essence comes back.

144
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:56,916
WEDDING CEREMONY
MAM - MARK

145
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
May your essence come back!

146
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:02,166
Mam!

147
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:08,666
Pol?

148
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,333
Oh, my gosh! This is so not good.

149
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,083
How did you get here?

150
00:13:17,333 --> 00:13:18,833
What are you doing here?

151
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,500
Are you gonna wreck my daughter's wedding?

152
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:22,583
No, Dad Johnny.

153
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:25,083
How many times
have I told you I'm not your dad?

154
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,875
My daughter is getting married today.

155
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:29,083
Stay away from her.

156
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,000
-Go!
-I won't go.

157
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,458
Not until I talk to Mam.
She can't marry another man.

158
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:37,583
Leave by yourself or I'll make you.

159
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,458
Wait up, Dad Johnny.

160
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:41,500
I just want to…

161
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,416
Hey.

162
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,666
He has a gun!

163
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:44,750
Get him.

164
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,083
I don't have a gun.

165
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,708
I'm not here to wreck your wedding.

166
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:51,041
I came back for you.

167
00:13:51,208 --> 00:13:52,333
Don't hurt him.

168
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:53,291
Stop!

169
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,125
Let me go!

170
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,375
Stop fighting, we're homies!

171
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,708
E-La, you stay here, sis. I'll find Pong.

172
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,875
Pol is alone, you beat him like an animal.

173
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,208
Looks like I have to disrobe this time.

174
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,166
Enough!

175
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,875
Pong! Why don't you pick up?

176
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,166
Pong, pick up the phone.

177
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,291
Stay out of it.

178
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:41,041
It's all ruined, don't you see?

179
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:43,791
Tell them to stop. I feel sorry for him.

180
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:47,458
Why do you care about him?
He has wrecked your wedding.

181
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:49,125
He didn't start the fight.

182
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:51,583
It was you, Dad!

183
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:55,250
Mam!

184
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,041
Pol.

185
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:17,708
Pol.

186
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:27,416
Pong, where are you?

187
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:31,166
Pong. Why don't you answer?

188
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,708
-Thip.
-Pong!

189
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,166
What's wrong, Thip?

190
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,583
Pong? Why didn't you pick up, Pong?

191
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,833
That's why the basket is vibrating.

192
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,833
Answer it now!

193
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:42,875
All right.

194
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,916
What's going on, Thip?

195
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,000
It's Pol.

196
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:48,541
Pol is back and he's getting beaten up.

197
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,875
Thip called me and said Pol was beaten up.

198
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,708
Pol was beaten!

199
00:15:52,791 --> 00:15:54,750
Pol.

200
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,333
Pol.

201
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,250
Pol.

202
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:02,583
Why are you back?

203
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:06,125
I thought you were working in Bangkok.

204
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,416
You thought I wouldn't be back

205
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:16,083
so you're getting married
without telling me?

206
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,750
It's not like that.

207
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:23,041
I wanted to tell you
when the time was right.

208
00:16:25,291 --> 00:16:26,916
When that day comes…

209
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:32,875
the gift I have saved up to buy
to show you what's in my mind

210
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:35,291
won't mean anything.

211
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,750
What is in your mind?

212
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,875
I intended to come back and tell you…

213
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,958
that I don't want
to be your friend anymore.

214
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,250
Can I be your boyfriend?

215
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:19,875
Pol.

216
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,000
Hey!

217
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:26,791
That's my daughter's dowry.

218
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,208
No, I bought it.

219
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:30,583
Don't you lie to me.

220
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,250
Get him out of here.

221
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:33,750
No! Don't!

222
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,458
Don't hurt him.

223
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,208
-No, Dad.
-Beat him.

224
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:41,750
No! Don't hurt him.

225
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,000
Calm down.

226
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,250
Don't hurt him!

227
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,958
Dad! Don't hurt him!

228
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:53,125
Pol, go.

229
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,541
Calm down.

230
00:17:54,625 --> 00:17:55,458
Pol, go.

231
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,458
Mam.

232
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,125
-Dad, don't!
-Mam!

233
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:02,333
-Pol!
-Mam!

234
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:10,500
Pol!

235
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:19,041
Pol.

236
00:18:21,625 --> 00:18:23,875
Johnny, you beat my son severely.

237
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,125
I'll beat the shit out of you.

238
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:29,958
No!

239
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,208
Calm down.

240
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:36,958
Stop!

241
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:38,833
I'll knock your teeth out, you farang.

242
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:53,916
Oh, my God!

243
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:55,541
My rice paddy.

244
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,625
My rice paddy.

245
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:01,250
500 baht. Each plant cost me 500 baht.

246
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,833
Dad.

247
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:09,541
Look around here!

248
00:19:09,625 --> 00:19:12,166
My daughter's wedding is ruined.

249
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,500
You have to be responsible for this!

250
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,333
Responsible with my feet!

251
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,583
You hurt my son
and you ask for my responsibility?

252
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:22,291
You shitty farang,
you only sell your daughter.

253
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,000
I'm not selling her.

254
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,041
I'm not that greedy.

255
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,541
Any father would do the same.

256
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:34,666
We all want our daughters
to live comfortably.

257
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,583
We hope they don't have to be a performer

258
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,666
or stay with a poor man like your son.

259
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,625
Just wait

260
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:44,916
for the day when E-La gets married.

261
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,958
I'll call you out as well!

262
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,333
Dad.

263
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,166
With this shitty mouth,

264
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,541
you can't live at Koak E-Gerng!

265
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,666
I'll kill you!

266
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:56,291
Stop!

267
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:57,708
Stop!

268
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,083
Stop.

269
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:02,458
What is this?

270
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,416
Enough with this nonsense.

271
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,000
Today is a good day,

272
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,916
an auspicious day.

273
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
A merit day for our village.

274
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,666
Can't I ask for one good thing
for Koak E-Gerng?

275
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:22,666
Pol!

276
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,500
Have you seen Pol?

277
00:20:24,916 --> 00:20:26,291
Have you? Have you seen him?

278
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,208
Pol.

279
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,166
Pol!

280
00:20:28,583 --> 00:20:29,583
Where are you?

281
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,791
-Pol!
-Dude!

282
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:36,250
Where are you?

283
00:21:30,666 --> 00:21:32,250
Dad Johnny.

284
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,833
I love Mam.

285
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,666
And I'm willing
to sacrifice anything for her.

286
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:43,500
Dad.

287
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:45,583
I love Pol.

288
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,125
I love Pol!

289
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:00,333
Enough.

290
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:28,416
So you've planned
to run away after the wedding?

291
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,041
Dad.

292
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:31,583
Well, I…

293
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:32,750
Mam.

294
00:22:33,083 --> 00:22:34,500
You can't lie.

295
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:37,791
Your dad found the bag you hid.

296
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:40,375
I don't love Mark.

297
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:42,208
And I'm not ready to get married.

298
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,750
You don't want to be married

299
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,500
but you're running away with Pol?

300
00:22:45,583 --> 00:22:46,916
It has nothing to do with Pol.

301
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,875
I just can't let you

302
00:22:50,583 --> 00:22:52,291
-force me any longer.
-Mam.

303
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:54,333
Ungrateful bitch.

304
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:56,250
Calm down. Calm down.

305
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,541
That's your daughter.

306
00:22:57,625 --> 00:22:59,750
She's still your daughter no matter what.

307
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:11,791
Mam.

308
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:15,875
Martin and I are childhood friends.

309
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,375
We grew up together in England.

310
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:23,000
I think about
your happiness and well-being

311
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:27,625
so I want you to be with someone I trust.

312
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:30,083
Is it my happiness

313
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,291
or yours?

314
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:34,333
Dad.

315
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:36,916
Just leave me alone!

316
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:18,708
Pol!

317
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,166
Come down here now!

318
00:24:23,041 --> 00:24:24,958
Scared of even an old man?

319
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,083
Oi!

320
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:30,166
Pol is not home. Just go back.

321
00:24:30,541 --> 00:24:32,416
Kiddo, don't lie to me.

322
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,250
Come down now, Pol!

323
00:24:34,625 --> 00:24:35,750
You crazy farang.

324
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:39,000
Don't you understand? Pol isn't here.

325
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,291
Fine.

326
00:24:40,583 --> 00:24:42,333
I'll find him myself.

327
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:46,291
And when I find him, he'll die at my feet.

328
00:24:49,625 --> 00:24:50,875
Crazy farang.

329
00:24:55,625 --> 00:24:56,583
Pao!

330
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,708
Mam is gone.

331
00:25:00,791 --> 00:25:01,666
What did you say?

332
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,833
Mam ran away, Dad.

333
00:25:03,458 --> 00:25:04,291
Mam.

334
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,791
Where are you?

335
00:25:07,208 --> 00:25:09,166
Come back to talk to me.

336
00:25:09,291 --> 00:25:10,708
Quickly. Go find her.

337
00:25:12,083 --> 00:25:12,916
Mam.

338
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:15,583
Come back now.

339
00:25:15,875 --> 00:25:16,833
Come on, girl.

340
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,125
Come back to talk.

341
00:25:18,875 --> 00:25:20,333
Let's sit and talk.

342
00:25:20,416 --> 00:25:22,125
-Mam.
-Stop.

343
00:25:23,916 --> 00:25:24,791
Mark.

344
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:26,166
Have you seen Mam?

345
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:27,708
I saw her go that way.

346
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,000
Come on. Hurry up.

347
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,916
Hurry up.

348
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:33,583
Mam!

349
00:25:36,416 --> 00:25:37,875
Mam. Where are you, Mam?

350
00:25:39,041 --> 00:25:40,291
Come back to talk.

351
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:42,333
Thanks, Mark.

352
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,333
Mam.

353
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:54,500
Let me help you.

354
00:25:54,583 --> 00:25:56,458
I've prepared this motorbike for us.

355
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,333
-Let's go.
-But…

356
00:25:59,916 --> 00:26:03,208
If your dad sees us,
we'll be in a big trouble.

357
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,083
Are you coming?

358
00:26:07,208 --> 00:26:08,291
Let's go.

359
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,708
Have a seat.

360
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:20,000
KHAO TOM PHRA NAKORN

361
00:27:20,083 --> 00:27:21,250
Khao Tom Phra Nakorn.

362
00:27:21,791 --> 00:27:22,750
Is that it?

363
00:27:29,041 --> 00:27:30,875
I'm looking for Auntie Thim.

364
00:27:38,166 --> 00:27:40,958
She left. She's gone to Pattaya.

365
00:27:42,458 --> 00:27:43,958
What does she do there?

366
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:45,458
How would I know?

367
00:27:46,583 --> 00:27:49,166
And you own this place?

368
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,750
Yes, it's mine.

369
00:27:51,625 --> 00:27:54,791
But Auntie Thim said
she's the owner's wife.

370
00:27:56,125 --> 00:27:57,541
What are you talking about?

371
00:27:58,583 --> 00:27:59,416
Look at this photo.

372
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,333
What?

373
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:03,958
Thim.

374
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:07,166
You did it again, bastard!

375
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,250
-How much did you give her?
-Let's leave.

376
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,500
The staff ran away because of you.

377
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:13,916
-Calm down, honey.
-I can't calm down, bastard.

378
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,250
What now, Mam?

379
00:28:27,708 --> 00:28:29,750
Do you want to find Auntie Thim
in Pattaya?

380
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:31,166
I'll take you there.

381
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:38,458
Mam.

382
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,791
Please let this friend take care of you
when you have no one left.

383
00:28:46,416 --> 00:28:47,250
Okay?

384
00:28:59,833 --> 00:29:01,208
Hello, Mr. Tou.

385
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:03,125
How is it going?

386
00:29:03,791 --> 00:29:05,750
I heard the news and I'm worried.

387
00:29:06,541 --> 00:29:08,083
If he had been come to me,

388
00:29:08,625 --> 00:29:11,125
his daughter wouldn't have run away.

389
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:14,791
Thank you, sir.

390
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:16,666
And about the debt…

391
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,333
Don't worry about your debt.

392
00:29:19,041 --> 00:29:21,708
Just watch over Johnny.

393
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,666
Don't let him drink too much.

394
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:26,750
Loser farang, drinks like a fish.

395
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:27,666
Go.

396
00:29:51,625 --> 00:29:53,625
Mam. Your phone.

397
00:29:57,208 --> 00:29:58,708
Should I really turn it off?

398
00:29:59,125 --> 00:30:00,041
Yeah.

399
00:30:03,916 --> 00:30:05,583
Sorry, Dad.

400
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,000
Don't worry.

401
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,208
Wait for the dust to settle

402
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,500
and everything will be all right.

403
00:30:25,208 --> 00:30:27,041
Leave other people's world.

404
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:31,041
It's not ours anymore.

405
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,583
We're tired from traveling.
Let's get some rest.

406
00:30:52,666 --> 00:30:54,166
Don't you worry.

407
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,916
We're not gonna sleep together.

408
00:30:57,083 --> 00:31:00,166
You sleep here, I sleep next to the wall.

409
00:31:35,916 --> 00:31:36,750
Pol!

410
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:39,541
I just want to say

411
00:31:39,625 --> 00:31:42,916
that I toss and turn while I'm sleeping.

412
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,791
I also want to tell you

413
00:31:46,333 --> 00:31:48,416
that I shudder while I'm sleeping.

414
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,250
Ouch!

415
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:52,375
Mam.

416
00:31:53,208 --> 00:31:55,291
Are you not worry it's broken?

417
00:31:55,625 --> 00:31:57,000
You don't know
how to take care of your things.

418
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:58,250
You had it coming.

419
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,083
It's all you think about.

420
00:32:00,916 --> 00:32:02,625
Nobody gets to sleep tonight.

421
00:32:08,666 --> 00:32:09,625
Are you tired?

422
00:32:09,791 --> 00:32:10,708
No, sir.

423
00:32:11,083 --> 00:32:12,458
But I'm tired.

424
00:32:13,833 --> 00:32:14,666
Will you fight?

425
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:15,625
Yes, sir!

426
00:32:19,666 --> 00:32:21,500
Uncle Pao.

427
00:32:21,958 --> 00:32:22,791
What?

428
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:26,458
They said Johnny's motorbike
crashed over there.

429
00:32:26,541 --> 00:32:27,375
That way.

430
00:32:27,458 --> 00:32:28,708
-That way?
-Yes, that way.

431
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:29,791
Let's go.

432
00:32:29,875 --> 00:32:30,958
Is he all right?

433
00:32:31,041 --> 00:32:32,166
Hurry up.

434
00:32:32,791 --> 00:32:33,916
Come on. Let's go.

435
00:32:52,750 --> 00:32:53,833
Johnny.

436
00:32:57,333 --> 00:32:59,083
Johnny! Wake up!

437
00:32:59,208 --> 00:33:00,041
Wake up!

438
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:01,583
Wake up!

439
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:13,333
Mam ran away from me.

440
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:18,125
She's gone.

441
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,250
She finally left her dad.

442
00:33:55,083 --> 00:33:56,041
Mam.

443
00:33:57,041 --> 00:33:59,250
Don't leave me.

444
00:33:59,375 --> 00:34:00,500
Mam.

445
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,000
Come back home.

446
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,416
Mam.

447
00:34:19,666 --> 00:34:21,583
Who said Johnny was dead?

448
00:34:22,166 --> 00:34:23,500
Make way.

449
00:34:23,833 --> 00:34:25,125
We're relatives.

450
00:34:25,291 --> 00:34:27,000
Let's see if it's really him.

451
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:27,916
Let me see his face.

452
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,083
Guys.

453
00:34:33,125 --> 00:34:34,250
Is that Johnny?

454
00:34:34,333 --> 00:34:35,666
Johnny is really dead?

455
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,833
I can't believe my eyes.

456
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:40,958
Johnny is really dead.

457
00:34:41,875 --> 00:34:43,500
It's Johnny laying there.

458
00:34:43,625 --> 00:34:45,041
Poor Johnny.

459
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:48,041
Why did you die here in Koak E-Gerng?

460
00:34:48,708 --> 00:34:50,958
How will I tell your relatives?

461
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,708
He had just visited me this morning.

462
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:00,541
Johnny, when did you get here?

463
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,083
Martin.

464
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,208
Can you promise me

465
00:35:07,041 --> 00:35:08,833
that if anything happens to me,

466
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:11,375
you'll bring Mam back to England?

467
00:35:12,166 --> 00:35:14,208
Don't talk like that.

468
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:16,125
Mam is like my niece.

469
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,166
Of course I'll take care of her.

470
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:20,000
Come, have some breakfast.

471
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:26,791
Hey, wait!

472
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,000
What is it, Dad?

473
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,166
Have you washed your hands before eating?

474
00:35:31,166 --> 00:35:33,666
Come on, Pun.

475
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:36,166
Everyone in Koak E-Gerng is clean.

476
00:35:36,291 --> 00:35:37,291
Really, Sa-Waeng?

477
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:38,875
-Yeah, look at these flies.
-Why?

478
00:35:38,958 --> 00:35:40,250
When they land on something,

479
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:42,041
they wipe their little hands.

480
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,333
You look like a fly.

481
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:53,375
Can I have some booze?

482
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,166
Kaewta.

483
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:56,916
Get him some booze.

484
00:35:57,083 --> 00:35:58,041
All right.

485
00:35:58,708 --> 00:35:59,958
You're so kind.

486
00:36:03,583 --> 00:36:04,416
Here.

487
00:36:07,916 --> 00:36:09,166
Let go of my wife's hand.

488
00:36:10,708 --> 00:36:11,875
I said let go.

489
00:36:12,666 --> 00:36:13,875
Let go of her hand.

490
00:36:15,708 --> 00:36:16,541
Thanks.

491
00:36:16,625 --> 00:36:18,291
Go. Get lost.

492
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,333
What's wrong, Kaewta?

493
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:25,916
Suer.

494
00:36:26,458 --> 00:36:28,666
Johnny's hand was as cold as ice.

495
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,375
I have goosebumps.

496
00:36:30,958 --> 00:36:31,875
Really?

497
00:36:33,416 --> 00:36:36,041
He came to us this morning.

498
00:36:36,125 --> 00:36:37,750
He asked for booze, didn't he?

499
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:38,666
Yes.

500
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,750
I've just asked the officers.

501
00:36:40,916 --> 00:36:41,791
He died last night.

502
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,875
Last night?

503
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,666
If that's so, what we saw…

504
00:36:51,208 --> 00:36:53,083
Johnny, Isaan ghost.

505
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,166
This is going to be a legend.

506
00:37:02,625 --> 00:37:04,166
Attention!

507
00:37:05,083 --> 00:37:07,291
At ease!

508
00:37:10,125 --> 00:37:12,291
Your belly, what's that for?

509
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,375
Huh?

510
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:14,708
Huh?

511
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:17,750
Can you chase after the bad guys?

512
00:37:17,875 --> 00:37:18,958
Can you?

513
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,416
And sleeping on duty as well.

514
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:23,708
Don't let me see it again!

515
00:37:23,791 --> 00:37:26,541
Just yawning will get you fired.

516
00:37:31,625 --> 00:37:32,458
Sir!

517
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,625
Are you mocking your superior?

518
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:38,916
No, sir.

519
00:37:59,458 --> 00:38:02,583
How was it, Pao? Can you reach Mam?

520
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,750
No.

521
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:07,500
Can you reach Pol?

522
00:38:07,875 --> 00:38:08,833
No.

523
00:38:10,541 --> 00:38:13,208
Poor Johnny.

524
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:15,958
It's like what they said in the old days

525
00:38:16,041 --> 00:38:17,916
about people that died and wouldn't leave.

526
00:38:18,041 --> 00:38:19,458
He has worries,

527
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:23,041
so he haunts us all over the village.

528
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:28,375
Sister-in-law, don't talk nonsense.

529
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:32,291
The reason he's still around here
is because he's vengeful.

530
00:38:33,041 --> 00:38:35,583
Oh, you foul-mouthed…

531
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,500
Luang Por is here.

532
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:38,750
Greet them.

533
00:38:48,541 --> 00:38:50,875
Why are you heading back?

534
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,791
Dying and departing are kind of forlorn.

535
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,541
Why do those monks hide behind you?

536
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:10,500
They are newly ordained.

537
00:39:10,583 --> 00:39:13,000
This is their first time.
They are not used to it yet.

538
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,583
Don't know the right manners.

539
00:39:15,291 --> 00:39:16,541
Stand back.

540
00:39:16,875 --> 00:39:18,041
And line up.

541
00:39:20,541 --> 00:39:21,541
Fall in line.

542
00:39:23,541 --> 00:39:24,500
Mhom.

543
00:39:25,541 --> 00:39:27,708
Two days ordained
and you would be an abbot?

544
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:29,041
Wrong place.

545
00:39:31,291 --> 00:39:32,750
You ignorant…

546
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,875
Johnny Anderson.

547
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,208
How old was he?

548
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:40,916
Fifty-nine.

549
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:42,833
Fifty-nine.

550
00:39:42,916 --> 00:39:44,458
He was not that old.

551
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:54,250
-Whoa, what was that?
-A cat.

552
00:39:54,375 --> 00:39:55,583
I'm startled.

553
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:00,916
Get a hold of yourself.

554
00:40:01,375 --> 00:40:02,500
We'll start chanting.

555
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,666
Johnny!

556
00:40:55,916 --> 00:40:56,791
Who's that?

557
00:41:22,291 --> 00:41:23,500
I'm terrified.

558
00:41:33,416 --> 00:41:34,541
Oh, no!

559
00:41:35,791 --> 00:41:37,041
Pun.

560
00:41:37,291 --> 00:41:38,791
The door!

561
00:41:43,875 --> 00:41:44,708
Pun.

562
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:47,083
The window is open!

563
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,500
It's quiet now.

564
00:41:56,583 --> 00:41:57,750
He's gone.

565
00:41:59,166 --> 00:42:00,375
He's gone.

566
00:42:01,958 --> 00:42:04,875
Luang Por, can we stay with you tonight?

567
00:42:05,458 --> 00:42:06,750
All right then.

568
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:09,958
Take cover under the blanket.

569
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,125
Who farted?

570
00:42:16,458 --> 00:42:17,541
Luang Por?

571
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,125
I didn't.

572
00:42:19,541 --> 00:42:20,625
I only yawned.

573
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,708
And that was just a yawn.

574
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,625
Don't you see, Pun?

575
00:42:25,708 --> 00:42:29,541
When Johnny was still alive,
you always fought with him.

576
00:42:29,625 --> 00:42:32,291
He must be coming to you now.

577
00:42:33,666 --> 00:42:35,625
Not only me, you too.

578
00:42:35,708 --> 00:42:38,916
You always want a farang husband.

579
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,750
Johnny, come take Pong.
I broke up with her.

580
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:49,250
The lucky lotus.

581
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,833
Like… I have seen it somewhere.

582
00:42:54,916 --> 00:42:56,458
Thank you.

583
00:43:00,208 --> 00:43:02,041
It's mine.

584
00:43:19,541 --> 00:43:21,375
Why didn't you die back in your country?

585
00:43:21,458 --> 00:43:23,375
Instead of dying in Koak E-Gerng.

586
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,375
Johnny Isaan Ghost.

587
00:43:25,666 --> 00:43:27,666
The first farang ghost of Isaan.

588
00:43:28,041 --> 00:43:29,375
So terrifying.

589
00:43:29,791 --> 00:43:31,916
I knew it. What the hell?

590
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:46,916
Get inside.

591
00:43:52,791 --> 00:43:53,708
Luang Por.

592
00:43:54,333 --> 00:43:57,375
Why is the window open?

593
00:43:58,583 --> 00:44:01,208
It's the wind. The window isn't latched.

594
00:44:07,208 --> 00:44:08,208
Luang Por!

595
00:44:08,291 --> 00:44:10,291
Chant something, Luang Por.

596
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:12,416
Get out, please.

597
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:16,708
Luang Por, he keeps accelerating.

598
00:44:16,791 --> 00:44:19,833
Have you heard of a monk
who jumps out of the window?

599
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:23,333
No, only a monk who jumps off the wall.

600
00:44:23,416 --> 00:44:24,833
I'll show you.

601
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,333
The first-ever jumping-out monk.

602
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:38,791
A jumping-out monk!

603
00:44:43,583 --> 00:44:44,541
And Johnny Ghost.

604
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:46,291
This bastard won't go away.

605
00:44:47,791 --> 00:44:48,666
Stubborn ghost.

606
00:44:49,666 --> 00:44:50,833
I'm going.

607
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:55,666
Drink to cheer ourselves up.

608
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,458
-Another shot?
-Sure.

609
00:45:36,666 --> 00:45:38,916
Who would buy booze for ghosts?

610
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:42,416
-Sieng, I've got a craving.
-What?

611
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:43,625
A craving?

612
00:45:44,291 --> 00:45:47,083
Sa-Waeng! You said just a sip.

613
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:51,166
Save some for me. I crave it too.

614
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:53,500
Give me some booze.

615
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,083
Johnny Ghost!

616
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:04,041
You crave it too?
All right, come and get it.

617
00:46:19,666 --> 00:46:21,416
-Wait.
-What?

618
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:23,333
Sieng.

619
00:46:23,791 --> 00:46:24,958
I have an idea.

620
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:29,708
Run.

621
00:46:29,791 --> 00:46:30,708
I'm running.

622
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:31,750
Run faster!

623
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:38,250
Hurry up.

624
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,500
I think we lost him.

625
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:08,791
Johnny, I'm done playing your game.

626
00:47:23,916 --> 00:47:25,125
That's it, run!

627
00:47:31,958 --> 00:47:33,083
Where are you going?

628
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:34,791
Running away from Johnny.

629
00:47:35,375 --> 00:47:36,291
How about you?

630
00:47:36,375 --> 00:47:37,541
We're doing the same.

631
00:47:37,625 --> 00:47:39,458
-Which way is he coming from?
-That way.

632
00:47:56,250 --> 00:47:57,125
He's gone!

633
00:48:03,458 --> 00:48:04,625
He's back!

634
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:11,750
I wanna shit my pants
to scare the ghost away.

635
00:48:14,958 --> 00:48:17,333
Why doesn't he sleep at this hour?

636
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,666
Gotcha! Johnny.

637
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,500
Help us, guys!

638
00:48:35,916 --> 00:48:37,416
Who hit my head?

639
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:41,375
You all raise your hand for what?

640
00:48:42,208 --> 00:48:43,500
Run!

641
00:49:14,416 --> 00:49:15,666
You surprised me.

642
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,958
How did you get here?

643
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,958
The mall is about to close.

644
00:49:28,083 --> 00:49:29,458
Why are you here?

645
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:34,875
I can't stay by myself at night.

646
00:49:35,666 --> 00:49:38,541
So… I came to see you.

647
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:55,208
I'm glad to see your smile.

648
00:49:57,750 --> 00:50:01,166
But if your superior knew,
wouldn't you be fired?

649
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:02,583
Mam.

650
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:05,000
Who would dare fire the owner's son?

651
00:50:05,875 --> 00:50:06,958
Don't be silly.

652
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:10,166
If I was fired,

653
00:50:10,666 --> 00:50:12,583
I could find a new job.

654
00:50:15,291 --> 00:50:17,250
You must have applied at many places.

655
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,500
Aren't you into Bangkok girls

656
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:22,458
and don't want to go back to Koak E-Gerng?

657
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:24,208
I have no one.

658
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:27,958
All I want is to make big money

659
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:32,666
to prove to Dad Johnny
that although I'm not a boxer,

660
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:34,041
I can take care of you.

661
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:36,708
Pol.

662
00:50:39,625 --> 00:50:41,708
Mam. I'll show you something.

663
00:50:42,291 --> 00:50:43,875
-Show me what?
-Follow me.

664
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:46,375
This way.

665
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:48,000
What is it?

666
00:50:48,750 --> 00:50:49,875
You'll see.

667
00:51:00,541 --> 00:51:01,916
A wedding gown.

668
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:05,041
A wedding suit.

669
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:08,666
Here they are. My dream.

670
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:14,875
The gold necklace I bought you

671
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:19,208
is proof that I didn't boast about it.

672
00:51:20,250 --> 00:51:22,041
I really love you.

673
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:26,333
And I'd like to know what you think.

674
00:51:33,416 --> 00:51:34,583
Pol.

675
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:38,916
I…

676
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:42,583
I…

677
00:51:44,291 --> 00:51:45,791
Mam.

678
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:49,333
You don't have to tell me now.

679
00:51:49,458 --> 00:51:50,666
I'm afraid I'd be disappointed.

680
00:51:53,916 --> 00:51:55,125
For now,

681
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,458
just let me rehearse our wedding.

682
00:51:59,541 --> 00:52:01,583
Just in case you turn me down,

683
00:52:01,708 --> 00:52:04,750
so I don't keep my hopes up.

684
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:06,458
All right?

685
00:52:14,250 --> 00:52:18,541
Thank you everyone
for joining our wedding ceremony.

686
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:22,500
I promise that I will love

687
00:52:22,708 --> 00:52:26,208
and take care of my bride
for the rest of my life.

688
00:52:28,166 --> 00:52:30,541
Now the emcee can take it from here.

689
00:52:32,375 --> 00:52:33,708
Where's your emcee?

690
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:35,083
Right here.

691
00:52:39,833 --> 00:52:45,333
And now, the groom may kiss the bride.

692
00:53:06,125 --> 00:53:07,750
The bride…

693
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:10,125
may kiss the groom now.

694
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:11,333
Pol.

695
00:53:13,375 --> 00:53:14,291
Mam.

696
00:53:29,625 --> 00:53:33,291
Does anyone object to our marriage?

697
00:53:35,916 --> 00:53:37,333
I object!

698
00:53:40,666 --> 00:53:42,125
Did you hear that?

699
00:53:42,208 --> 00:53:43,166
Hear what?

700
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,708
You didn't hear that?

701
00:53:44,791 --> 00:53:47,416
No. What is it? Where?

702
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:48,916
What are you looking for?

703
00:53:55,291 --> 00:53:56,333
What was that noise?

704
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:58,750
Come this way.

705
00:54:05,833 --> 00:54:07,083
I shouldn't have.

706
00:54:17,125 --> 00:54:19,333
Pol.

707
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,833
Oh, I'm in deep shit.

708
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:27,541
Pol.

709
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:30,166
Pol.

710
00:54:33,666 --> 00:54:36,000
Pol.

711
00:54:36,958 --> 00:54:37,791
Pol.

712
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:41,583
Pol.

713
00:54:44,166 --> 00:54:45,416
What's wrong?

714
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,583
Who are you looking for?

715
00:54:48,250 --> 00:54:49,458
I think I saw…

716
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:53,625
I saw someone walking here.

717
00:54:56,375 --> 00:54:58,458
-What…
-Who was it?

718
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:02,375
An illusion?

719
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:05,375
Mam, run.

720
00:55:05,458 --> 00:55:06,708
Pol, stop.

721
00:55:06,833 --> 00:55:09,000
Pol!

722
00:55:10,166 --> 00:55:11,000
Pol!

723
00:55:11,625 --> 00:55:13,166
Mam, come on.

724
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:14,166
Run.

725
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:17,541
You broke those things
and brought an outsider to the property.

726
00:55:17,625 --> 00:55:20,458
Stop, Pol. Pol!

727
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,458
You're fired!

728
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:43,541
You're also wearing boxing shorts.

729
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,708
Looks like tonight

730
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,916
there'll be a Koak E-Gerng fight!

731
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:55,291
What a thought!

732
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,875
You just got fired.

733
00:55:59,291 --> 00:56:01,333
How can you still be playful?

734
00:56:03,208 --> 00:56:04,208
Don't worry.

735
00:56:04,583 --> 00:56:07,000
I can find a job anywhere.

736
00:56:07,708 --> 00:56:10,666
If I can't get one here,
I'll go somewhere else.

737
00:56:11,291 --> 00:56:12,500
It's my fault.

738
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:15,500
I shouldn't have
dragged you into this mess.

739
00:56:16,083 --> 00:56:18,500
I'd do anything for you, Mam.

740
00:56:20,375 --> 00:56:22,416
I want to see you happy,

741
00:56:23,083 --> 00:56:25,416
and your sweet smile.

742
00:56:26,458 --> 00:56:27,541
Smile for me.

743
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:41,208
Tonight, is the red corner ready?

744
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:54,666
The red corner is ready,

745
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:57,708
the blue corner is ready…

746
00:56:58,208 --> 00:57:01,750
and in peak fighting shape!

747
00:57:03,250 --> 00:57:06,250
Now we start the foreplay.

748
00:57:07,416 --> 00:57:08,583
How?

749
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,291
Here, Mam.

750
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:24,250
Foreplay now.

751
00:57:44,291 --> 00:57:46,083
The bell hasn't rung.

752
00:57:47,041 --> 00:57:48,791
You jump start?

753
00:57:49,375 --> 00:57:51,666
Aren't you afraid of a head kick?

754
00:57:53,916 --> 00:57:56,500
If you gave me a head kick,

755
00:57:57,666 --> 00:57:59,750
I'd hold your legs,

756
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:02,125
plowing for four or five rounds.

757
00:58:03,125 --> 00:58:05,625
And if I punched you below the belt?

758
00:58:08,333 --> 00:58:09,916
I'd hold you down

759
00:58:10,291 --> 00:58:12,375
and knee you

760
00:58:13,916 --> 00:58:17,541
until you begged me to stop.

761
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:22,583
Now that you've heard this,

762
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,916
do you still dare to fight me?

763
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:36,125
Since both boxers are ready,
let's get in the ring.

764
00:58:42,291 --> 00:58:44,708
The referee inspects the gloves.

765
00:58:49,583 --> 00:58:50,500
Gloves, check!

766
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,458
Now the groin guard.

767
00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:55,166
Red's jockstrap is good.

768
00:58:55,583 --> 00:58:57,958
Why don't we check yours?

769
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,750
Be my guest.

770
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,708
You think I wouldn't?

771
00:59:09,208 --> 00:59:10,916
You lost on a foul.

772
00:59:12,416 --> 00:59:14,625
You bring a bamboo tube to the ring.

773
00:59:14,708 --> 00:59:16,916
Want to hit my head with it?

774
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:22,333
Soon you'll know…

775
00:59:23,458 --> 00:59:25,000
the reason I brought it.

776
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:36,875
Does the first round begin?

777
01:00:10,666 --> 01:00:11,875
Hold on.

778
01:00:13,625 --> 01:00:14,916
Is that your phone?

779
01:00:16,041 --> 01:00:16,916
No.

780
01:00:17,083 --> 01:00:18,916
I turned it off.

781
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:19,875
Is it yours?

782
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:22,000
I turned mine off too.

783
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:34,958
Dad Johnny.

784
01:00:35,875 --> 01:00:36,875
Dad.

785
01:00:38,958 --> 01:00:39,833
Dad.

786
01:00:40,625 --> 01:00:41,583
What is it?

787
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:44,708
Dad.

788
01:00:48,291 --> 01:00:49,541
It was just on.

789
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,208
How is it off now?

790
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:53,291
Turn it back on.

791
01:01:00,791 --> 01:01:01,666
Uncle Pao.

792
01:01:04,333 --> 01:01:05,166
Uncle Pao.

793
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,416
Mam. Where are you?

794
01:01:07,958 --> 01:01:09,375
I couldn't reach you.

795
01:01:09,458 --> 01:01:11,333
Just hurry back home.

796
01:01:12,791 --> 01:01:13,833
Listen…

797
01:01:16,333 --> 01:01:17,458
Listen carefully, Mam.

798
01:01:19,583 --> 01:01:20,750
Your dad…

799
01:01:22,958 --> 01:01:23,833
He died.

800
01:01:24,416 --> 01:01:25,875
What did you say, Pao?

801
01:01:27,708 --> 01:01:30,708
Just now, my dad called me.

802
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:32,458
That's impossible.

803
01:01:32,541 --> 01:01:34,166
Your dad's been dead for days.

804
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:36,166
How could he call you?

805
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,083
What?

806
01:01:38,416 --> 01:01:39,333
Dad…

807
01:01:41,083 --> 01:01:42,583
Dad died.

808
01:01:43,416 --> 01:01:44,625
My dad died.

809
01:01:44,708 --> 01:01:46,375
-Mam.
-Dad.

810
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:48,166
-Dad!
-Mam!

811
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:50,875
Mam!

812
01:01:56,208 --> 01:01:57,333
Dad.

813
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:03,291
My dad died.

814
01:02:04,416 --> 01:02:06,375
Dad.

815
01:02:08,208 --> 01:02:10,041
Dad.

816
01:02:34,416 --> 01:02:35,416
Dad.

817
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,958
I'm sorry.

818
01:02:41,083 --> 01:02:43,750
Please forgive me, Dad Johnny.

819
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:48,125
It's my fault.

820
01:02:52,125 --> 01:02:54,291
It's not your fault.

821
01:02:57,250 --> 01:02:58,625
It's because of me…

822
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,000
running away.

823
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,750
Don't blame yourselves.

824
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,500
Johnny died because of booze.

825
01:03:11,208 --> 01:03:13,375
Can't only blame booze.

826
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:18,541
Johnny had a heart condition for years.

827
01:03:20,666 --> 01:03:25,333
He wanted her to marry
a promising young man.

828
01:03:25,666 --> 01:03:28,583
Not someone with no future like Pol.

829
01:03:30,416 --> 01:03:33,416
That's why he's so vengeful.

830
01:03:34,541 --> 01:03:37,041
Stop talking shit, Sa-Waeng.

831
01:03:44,125 --> 01:03:46,041
Speak of the devil.

832
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:49,666
Johnny's spirit won't spare you.

833
01:03:50,375 --> 01:03:52,291
We've all seen him.

834
01:04:00,666 --> 01:04:03,041
Oh, no.

835
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:10,333
Seriously, Pol,

836
01:04:10,458 --> 01:04:14,291
we have been wickedly haunted.

837
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:19,291
Nobody wants to go out after dark.

838
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:25,375
Why did the drum fall just now?

839
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:30,833
Because we're talking about Johnny.
That's why it happened, Pun.

840
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:32,916
Do you see?

841
01:04:33,041 --> 01:04:36,875
Since you came back, he got way scarier.

842
01:04:37,958 --> 01:04:38,833
That's right.

843
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:41,375
You should leave Koak E-Gerng

844
01:04:41,458 --> 01:04:44,666
if you don't want Johnny
to break your neck.

845
01:04:45,625 --> 01:04:48,208
Honey, where do you want Pol to go?

846
01:04:48,291 --> 01:04:49,208
I don't know.

847
01:04:49,291 --> 01:04:51,583
Johnny can follow him everywhere.

848
01:04:53,125 --> 01:04:54,208
I have an idea.

849
01:04:55,416 --> 01:04:57,541
Pol has to break up with Mam.

850
01:04:57,625 --> 01:04:59,375
Great idea, Sa-Waeng.

851
01:05:00,041 --> 01:05:00,958
No!

852
01:05:01,333 --> 01:05:02,500
I love Mam.

853
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,666
Nobody can stop me.

854
01:05:10,125 --> 01:05:13,000
Keep it in your mind.
Don't say it out loud.

855
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:17,541
You know I've been in love
with her since childhood.

856
01:05:18,791 --> 01:05:20,916
And I'll love her until I grow old.

857
01:05:27,208 --> 01:05:29,958
Pol, I know you share my qualities.

858
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:34,166
But you shouldn't speak
about your love too loudly.

859
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:35,583
Well…

860
01:05:37,083 --> 01:05:39,333
Johnny's spirit is fierce.

861
01:05:39,416 --> 01:05:41,625
No, Dad. Absolutely not.

862
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:43,500
Love is love.

863
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,708
I can't hold it back.

864
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,750
It might kill me
sooner than Dad Johnny's spirit.

865
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:52,875
Don't you get it?

866
01:06:07,666 --> 01:06:08,625
What?

867
01:06:10,833 --> 01:06:12,083
Back off!

868
01:06:13,166 --> 01:06:14,458
Move back!

869
01:06:19,833 --> 01:06:20,708
What's wrong?

870
01:06:22,666 --> 01:06:24,041
Move back!

871
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:25,625
Don't come close!

872
01:06:30,333 --> 01:06:32,166
My friend, I'll help you.

873
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:39,083
Hey!

874
01:06:40,166 --> 01:06:41,791
Why are we still here? Run!

875
01:06:50,041 --> 01:06:51,125
Pol, run!

876
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:52,416
Go!

877
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:01,666
Johnny's spirit is so vengeful.

878
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,625
Nobody gets any sleep.

879
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:05,333
We're all troubled, Luang Por.

880
01:07:06,416 --> 01:07:08,958
I want you to cast a spell on the chains.

881
01:07:09,750 --> 01:07:11,541
On the chains?

882
01:07:11,833 --> 01:07:14,875
I can cast a spell
with holy water or yarn.

883
01:07:14,958 --> 01:07:17,250
I've never done it with chains.

884
01:07:17,333 --> 01:07:19,541
Can't do this, can't do that.

885
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:21,083
Why did you become a monk at all?

886
01:07:21,416 --> 01:07:22,291
Sa-Waeng.

887
01:07:22,833 --> 01:07:24,916
You think I'm your playmate or something?

888
01:07:25,208 --> 01:07:26,458
Cast whatever you want.

889
01:07:26,541 --> 01:07:28,166
If you want me to, all right.

890
01:07:29,208 --> 01:07:30,500
But actually,

891
01:07:30,666 --> 01:07:34,166
you should just ask for his forgiveness.

892
01:07:34,291 --> 01:07:36,083
We'll just do this for now.

893
01:07:53,666 --> 01:07:55,291
What's wrong, Luang Por?

894
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:56,458
It's sacred.

895
01:07:56,750 --> 01:07:58,125
Buddha's grace.

896
01:07:59,125 --> 01:08:00,375
Amen!

897
01:08:02,375 --> 01:08:04,041
Mam, light the incense.

898
01:08:04,291 --> 01:08:06,833
Let Pol ask for his forgiveness.

899
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,916
Explain nicely. He should understand you.

900
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:34,875
He hasn't even started yet.

901
01:08:34,958 --> 01:08:36,916
Give my son a chance.

902
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,416
Johnny, I beg you.

903
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:47,916
Dad Johnny,

904
01:08:50,083 --> 01:08:52,791
me and my family have come
to ask for your forgiveness.

905
01:08:55,041 --> 01:08:56,833
We want to make things right…

906
01:08:58,291 --> 01:09:00,250
and tell you the truth.

907
01:09:02,208 --> 01:09:05,208
When Mam and I were away in Bangkok,

908
01:09:06,291 --> 01:09:09,125
I didn't offend her in any way.

909
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,583
All we did was hold hands,

910
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:20,166
a kiss on the cheeks,
a little kiss on the lips.

911
01:09:24,208 --> 01:09:25,208
But…

912
01:09:26,125 --> 01:09:27,541
there was no tongue involved.

913
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:33,000
He's at it!

914
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:39,375
I don't believe what Pol said.

915
01:09:39,458 --> 01:09:41,041
They were alone together.

916
01:09:41,125 --> 01:09:43,125
She isn't pregnant already, you think?

917
01:09:43,541 --> 01:09:44,625
Your filthy mouth.

918
01:09:46,958 --> 01:09:49,125
All right. Don't be afraid.

919
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:52,291
I already cast a spell on the chains.

920
01:09:53,083 --> 01:09:54,458
Bring it on.

921
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:56,375
Come on.

922
01:09:56,708 --> 01:09:57,750
I've cast those chains.

923
01:09:57,833 --> 01:09:58,666
Locked it myself.

924
01:09:58,750 --> 01:10:00,083
He can't escape.

925
01:10:01,041 --> 01:10:02,875
Are you challenging me, Johnny?

926
01:10:10,625 --> 01:10:12,250
Don't be afraid.

927
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,333
It's the end of the chains.

928
01:10:16,041 --> 01:10:17,458
Hey, Johnny.

929
01:10:18,041 --> 01:10:19,666
To the main road, how much?

930
01:10:21,916 --> 01:10:23,500
It's no time for jokes.

931
01:10:25,750 --> 01:10:26,583
Luang Por.

932
01:10:31,666 --> 01:10:32,583
Our family…

933
01:10:32,916 --> 01:10:34,458
Stay united!

934
01:10:35,291 --> 01:10:36,833
And run for your life!

935
01:10:40,041 --> 01:10:40,875
Go!

936
01:10:40,958 --> 01:10:41,791
Pol.

937
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:44,583
Why are you standing still? Go!

938
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:51,250
Good luck, everyone.

939
01:11:07,916 --> 01:11:09,750
No. Let me go, Mom.

940
01:11:11,291 --> 01:11:12,458
I love Mam.

941
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:19,166
Dead or alive,
I'll love her until I grow old.

942
01:11:20,625 --> 01:11:22,583
I'll never stop loving her.

943
01:11:33,916 --> 01:11:35,000
Dad!

944
01:11:42,041 --> 01:11:43,083
It's me.

945
01:11:45,791 --> 01:11:46,625
Pol!

946
01:11:47,250 --> 01:11:50,458
From now on, stop being my friend

947
01:11:50,541 --> 01:11:52,208
and be my boyfriend.

948
01:11:53,250 --> 01:11:54,458
I love him.

949
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:56,958
I love her too.

950
01:11:59,541 --> 01:12:02,458
Dad, stop being angry at him.

951
01:12:02,875 --> 01:12:04,833
He really loves me.

952
01:12:05,333 --> 01:12:07,083
And I love him back.

953
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,125
Your daughter here…

954
01:12:11,583 --> 01:12:13,208
can't live alone

955
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:15,833
without him by her side.

956
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:26,041
Where has he gone?

957
01:12:30,041 --> 01:12:31,666
-He's gone.
-Behind a tree?

958
01:12:36,041 --> 01:12:36,875
Get off.

959
01:12:38,083 --> 01:12:38,916
Go.

960
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:41,750
Hey!

961
01:12:41,916 --> 01:12:43,000
What did you do?

962
01:12:44,708 --> 01:12:46,708
I used to be a boxer.

963
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:47,625
Pao.

964
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:49,041
Go one on one…

965
01:12:49,458 --> 01:12:50,416
Get up.

966
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:52,416
Three million Baht in debt!

967
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:54,500
So much.

968
01:12:56,041 --> 01:12:57,958
Since your mom passed away,

969
01:12:58,083 --> 01:13:00,041
your dad became a drunkard.

970
01:13:00,458 --> 01:13:02,416
Ignored his boxing gym.

971
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,375
He got an illegal loan.

972
01:13:04,458 --> 01:13:06,916
I warned him but he didn't listen.

973
01:13:07,166 --> 01:13:08,958
It was just 500,000.

974
01:13:09,458 --> 01:13:12,625
But its interest has compounded
to three million.

975
01:13:22,666 --> 01:13:24,458
Hang in there, Mam.

976
01:13:35,375 --> 01:13:37,916
You know that's cheating.

977
01:13:38,458 --> 01:13:40,458
Johnny only owed you 500,000.

978
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,583
You added one more zero
to make it five million,

979
01:13:42,666 --> 01:13:44,125
then "discounted" it to three million.

980
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:46,291
Nobody can come up with
that kind of money.

981
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,500
You have a problem, huh?

982
01:13:49,583 --> 01:13:50,750
How could you do it?

983
01:13:53,208 --> 01:13:54,833
Stop!

984
01:13:55,250 --> 01:13:56,083
Stop!

985
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:57,041
Stop!

986
01:13:57,333 --> 01:14:00,458
This is a temple, not a boxing ring.

987
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:01,958
You fight like dogs.

988
01:14:02,041 --> 01:14:04,166
Yes, you can't keep arguing.

989
01:14:04,458 --> 01:14:06,041
The problem is still there.

990
01:14:06,875 --> 01:14:09,416
If you want me to judge this case,
then sit down.

991
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:11,666
Sit down!

992
01:14:13,916 --> 01:14:17,250
Negotiate with new rules.

993
01:14:17,875 --> 01:14:19,833
If anyone argues,

994
01:14:19,916 --> 01:14:22,291
I'll cast black magic on them.

995
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:26,458
What the heck.

996
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:28,458
Well, Luang Por.

997
01:14:28,541 --> 01:14:30,583
We want to help Mam.

998
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:33,458
We sold our assets,

999
01:14:33,541 --> 01:14:36,000
and mortgaged our land.
We've got one million.

1000
01:14:36,875 --> 01:14:39,166
So we've made a decision

1001
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:46,250
to bet our one million Baht
on a fight with your best boxer.

1002
01:14:46,750 --> 01:14:49,791
If you win, you take the million

1003
01:14:50,041 --> 01:14:53,083
and lands, homes, boxing camp,

1004
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:55,583
whatever you want to cover the debt.

1005
01:14:55,958 --> 01:14:57,541
But if we win,

1006
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:01,875
all the debts must be cancelled.

1007
01:15:01,958 --> 01:15:03,083
Are you in?

1008
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:08,041
And who's your fighter?

1009
01:15:08,708 --> 01:15:10,208
Don't tell me it's Mam.

1010
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:13,583
If it's Mam, I'll only mingle with her.

1011
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,125
It's me! I will fight you!

1012
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:21,208
You're not on my level.

1013
01:15:21,625 --> 01:15:24,916
You will fight with Saen Phu Kwai.

1014
01:15:27,375 --> 01:15:31,333
Oh, Johnny

1015
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:38,000
May your spirit come help us

1016
01:15:40,958 --> 01:15:44,000
Damn, Waeng. Just ask him.

1017
01:15:44,083 --> 01:15:45,583
Tell him directly.

1018
01:15:45,666 --> 01:15:47,000
Pol will fight on the ring.

1019
01:15:48,041 --> 01:15:51,625
Please help him win. Help him.

1020
01:15:51,708 --> 01:15:53,125
If you don't,

1021
01:15:53,208 --> 01:15:58,041
Mafia Tou will confiscate
the land from all villagers

1022
01:15:58,125 --> 01:16:00,833
and your daughter, Johnny.

1023
01:16:01,166 --> 01:16:05,958
We hope you understand, Johnny.

1024
01:16:09,291 --> 01:16:11,791
Oh, so annoying, you drama queen.

1025
01:16:21,541 --> 01:16:23,958
For Koak E-Gerng villagers,
for all the debts.

1026
01:16:24,041 --> 01:16:26,833
And most importantly, for your woman.

1027
01:16:53,333 --> 01:16:56,000
You think I'm gonna win?

1028
01:17:11,125 --> 01:17:14,541
You'll meet with your favorite boxers.

1029
01:17:14,875 --> 01:17:16,208
In the red corner,

1030
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:20,625
the handsome boxer Tossapol Koak E-Gerng!

1031
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,833
Pol! Pol! Pol!

1032
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:44,375
And the fighter in the blue corner,

1033
01:17:44,458 --> 01:17:46,500
Saen Phu Kwai!

1034
01:17:55,375 --> 01:17:57,166
With that body, he isn't Phu Kwai.

1035
01:17:57,250 --> 01:17:58,500
More like a monster Phu Kwai.

1036
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:03,666
Tou, you were born to cheat us.

1037
01:18:04,041 --> 01:18:08,750
Why don't you blame yourself
for being poor?

1038
01:18:31,875 --> 01:18:34,833
Fight him, Pol. Beat him up.

1039
01:18:51,125 --> 01:18:52,166
Round one. Begin!

1040
01:18:53,083 --> 01:18:53,916
Box!

1041
01:19:21,125 --> 01:19:22,791
Wait, go to the corner.

1042
01:19:23,250 --> 01:19:24,208
Oh, I'm gonna faint.

1043
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:32,833
Whoa, so close.

1044
01:19:32,916 --> 01:19:34,166
End of round one.

1045
01:19:36,458 --> 01:19:38,000
Sister-in-law.

1046
01:19:38,083 --> 01:19:39,875
I'm gonna faint, can I have some balm?

1047
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:40,916
Here you go.

1048
01:19:43,333 --> 01:19:46,041
You'll get him this round, Pol.

1049
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:51,208
Full on, Pol.

1050
01:19:51,291 --> 01:19:53,875
Nobody can take you now. Trust me.

1051
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:59,166
Second round!

1052
01:20:10,833 --> 01:20:11,833
Punch him!

1053
01:20:19,458 --> 01:20:20,375
Punch him!

1054
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:56,583
Yeah!

1055
01:20:57,208 --> 01:20:59,250
What are they doing up there?

1056
01:20:59,375 --> 01:21:00,708
What are you doing?

1057
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:03,500
The referee hasn't counted yet.

1058
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:04,708
Get out of the ring.

1059
01:21:05,958 --> 01:21:07,958
Why the hell did they go up there?
Get down.

1060
01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:09,916
Get down.

1061
01:21:13,916 --> 01:21:14,958
Go to the corner.

1062
01:21:17,250 --> 01:21:19,583
One. Two.

1063
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,750
Three. Four.

1064
01:21:22,208 --> 01:21:24,916
Five. Six. Seven.

1065
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,708
Eight. Nine.

1066
01:21:35,041 --> 01:21:37,500
What's wrong with you?
Why didn't you punch him?

1067
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:38,875
I did.

1068
01:21:39,375 --> 01:21:41,125
Pol. Keep it up!

1069
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:42,791
I'm here, nephew.

1070
01:21:43,083 --> 01:21:45,458
He can't see anything this time. Fight!

1071
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:49,291
Get up. Come here.

1072
01:22:05,750 --> 01:22:07,041
Here is round three!

1073
01:22:07,125 --> 01:22:08,125
Box!

1074
01:22:14,166 --> 01:22:15,000
Yes!

1075
01:22:16,708 --> 01:22:17,541
Kick!

1076
01:22:27,333 --> 01:22:28,166
What?

1077
01:22:34,083 --> 01:22:36,041
-Kick!
-Kick!

1078
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:42,666
Now he's disoriented.

1079
01:22:43,041 --> 01:22:44,291
Hit him hard.

1080
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:47,416
Why are you running around?

1081
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:48,333
Box!

1082
01:22:48,875 --> 01:22:50,375
He got punched and disoriented.

1083
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:55,333
Box!

1084
01:23:09,083 --> 01:23:10,250
What's wrong with you?

1085
01:23:10,333 --> 01:23:11,458
He's not human.

1086
01:23:11,541 --> 01:23:13,458
Not human, my ass!

1087
01:23:13,541 --> 01:23:15,791
He's standing right there.
Are you throwing the fight?

1088
01:23:16,583 --> 01:23:18,333
I said he's not human.

1089
01:23:18,958 --> 01:23:19,791
Go!

1090
01:23:19,875 --> 01:23:20,833
Come on.

1091
01:23:20,916 --> 01:23:22,916
Pol! Fight him!

1092
01:23:23,666 --> 01:23:24,500
Box!

1093
01:23:36,958 --> 01:23:37,791
Box!

1094
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:39,291
Pol! Keep it up!

1095
01:24:21,958 --> 01:24:25,250
You must fight him. Don't give up.

1096
01:24:26,208 --> 01:24:29,291
You are the hope of Koak E-Gerng.

1097
01:24:30,208 --> 01:24:31,583
Fight him, Pol.

1098
01:24:33,416 --> 01:24:36,041
Fight him, my son-in-law.

1099
01:24:37,375 --> 01:24:40,041
Fight him, my son-in-law!

1100
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:50,833
Son-in-law?

1101
01:24:57,166 --> 01:24:58,375
To the corner.

1102
01:25:03,583 --> 01:25:04,458
Son-in-law?

1103
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:05,833
One.

1104
01:25:06,458 --> 01:25:08,208
-Pol.
-Two.

1105
01:25:08,291 --> 01:25:09,166
Son-in-law?

1106
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:10,083
Pol!

1107
01:25:11,666 --> 01:25:12,500
Come on, fight!

1108
01:25:12,916 --> 01:25:13,750
Four.

1109
01:25:13,833 --> 01:25:14,916
Fight him!

1110
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:15,833
Five.

1111
01:25:15,916 --> 01:25:16,791
Son-in-law?

1112
01:25:18,083 --> 01:25:19,000
Six.

1113
01:25:21,125 --> 01:25:21,958
Seven.

1114
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:25,250
Eight.

1115
01:25:37,625 --> 01:25:38,458
Fight!

1116
01:25:40,833 --> 01:25:41,791
Kill him!

1117
01:25:42,458 --> 01:25:43,291
Box!

1118
01:25:56,416 --> 01:25:58,125
This hook is for Mam!

1119
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:09,375
You must fight him.

1120
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:11,583
Fight him, my son-in-law.

1121
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,916
This hook is for Dad Johnny!

1122
01:26:18,291 --> 01:26:19,833
Don't give up.

1123
01:26:20,625 --> 01:26:23,625
You are the hope of Koak E-Gerng.

1124
01:26:23,750 --> 01:26:26,125
This elbow is for Koak E-Gerng!

1125
01:26:39,416 --> 01:26:42,250
To the corner.

1126
01:26:44,208 --> 01:26:45,041
Wait.

1127
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:47,208
Wait. Don't go up yet.

1128
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:48,291
Didn't you learn something?

1129
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:50,583
-What?
-Let the referee count first.

1130
01:26:50,666 --> 01:26:51,541
That's right.

1131
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:53,666
I forgot.

1132
01:26:53,958 --> 01:26:54,875
One.

1133
01:26:54,958 --> 01:26:55,791
Saen Phu Kwai!

1134
01:26:55,875 --> 01:26:56,708
Two.

1135
01:26:56,791 --> 01:26:57,666
Get up!

1136
01:26:57,750 --> 01:26:59,500
Three. Four.

1137
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:02,416
-Get up! Quick!
-Five.

1138
01:27:03,166 --> 01:27:04,958
Six. Seven.

1139
01:27:05,750 --> 01:27:07,208
Eight. Nine.

1140
01:27:08,708 --> 01:27:09,750
Ten!

1141
01:27:56,875 --> 01:28:00,333
Check in at Koak E-Gerng

1142
01:28:00,416 --> 01:28:03,375
Always have a good time here

1143
01:28:04,416 --> 01:28:08,208
No more struggling
No more fighting in the big city

1144
01:28:08,291 --> 01:28:12,125
No matter what, we still have our home

1145
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:16,166
Beat down by a tough life?

1146
01:28:16,250 --> 01:28:20,166
Pain and discouragement is normal

1147
01:28:20,333 --> 01:28:23,833
We are poor at Koak E-Gerng
But have fun all year

1148
01:28:23,916 --> 01:28:25,000
What?

1149
01:28:25,875 --> 01:28:27,583
Mam, come here.

1150
01:28:27,666 --> 01:28:28,833
-Come on.
-What?

1151
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:30,750
Come on. Don't speak up.

1152
01:28:30,833 --> 01:28:32,083
Come here.

1153
01:28:35,458 --> 01:28:37,000
We won the grand prize!

1154
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:38,083
What?

1155
01:28:38,166 --> 01:28:39,250
Don't be loud.

1156
01:28:39,375 --> 01:28:40,583
We won the grand prize!

1157
01:28:40,708 --> 01:28:42,541
We won the grand prize
in the lottery, Mam.

1158
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:48,583
-How much?
-20 baht.

1159
01:28:50,958 --> 01:28:52,000
Damn it!

1160
01:29:10,166 --> 01:29:11,500
Two basil chicken, please.

1161
01:29:11,583 --> 01:29:12,916
I knew it!

1162
01:29:13,583 --> 01:29:14,416
Mam.

1163
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:16,291
Give me your phone.

1164
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:31,916
It's green.

1165
01:29:32,458 --> 01:29:33,500
Really?

1166
01:29:33,583 --> 01:29:35,250
Yes, don't be so loud.

1167
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,500
We won the grand prize!

1168
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:41,333
How much?

1169
01:29:41,625 --> 01:29:42,666
Twelve million.

1170
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:44,208
Don't be loud.

1171
01:29:44,333 --> 01:29:47,208
-Twelve million!
-Twelve million!

1172
01:29:48,291 --> 01:29:51,916
Beloved ones, come back home

1173
01:29:52,083 --> 01:29:55,750
Send your location to remind them
The old route home.

1174
01:29:56,041 --> 01:30:00,041
Let's dance to get rid of loneliness

1175
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:04,000
Come on, beloved ones, come back home

1176
01:30:04,083 --> 01:30:09,583
Beloved ones, come back home

1177
01:30:14,750 --> 01:30:16,791
Thank you so much

1178
01:30:17,166 --> 01:30:19,333
for making me this happy.

1179
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:24,166
I take it as a wonderful gift

1180
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,708
that is invaluable to my life.

1181
01:30:26,833 --> 01:30:28,500
And I take it that

1182
01:30:28,875 --> 01:30:33,708
Dad Johnny gave you to me as
the most valuable gift in my life as well.

1183
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:36,541
Don't worry about people
Criticize our poverty

1184
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:43,875
Koak E-Gerng people don't mind

1185
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:54,583
Martin, I have something to tell you.

1186
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:56,000
What is it?

1187
01:30:56,125 --> 01:30:57,750
About your son, Mark.

1188
01:30:58,208 --> 01:30:59,458
He wants your blessing.

1189
01:30:59,541 --> 01:31:00,416
To be ordained?

1190
01:31:01,791 --> 01:31:02,833
Or to have a new wife?

1191
01:31:02,916 --> 01:31:04,875
No. What a stupid man.

1192
01:31:06,500 --> 01:31:07,375
Mark!

1193
01:31:07,458 --> 01:31:08,666
He won't come out by that name.

1194
01:31:08,791 --> 01:31:11,208
You're supposed to call him… Markie!

1195
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:26,583
Hello, Daddy.

1196
01:31:28,833 --> 01:31:31,750
I want your blessing to be a ladyboy.

1197
01:31:35,708 --> 01:31:37,125
So happy he fainted.

1198
01:31:37,791 --> 01:31:39,833
Daddy.

1199
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:48,541
Bring your heart back
Bring your heart back

1200
01:31:48,625 --> 01:31:52,541
Wealth can always be found
If we are still alive

1201
01:31:52,625 --> 01:31:57,125
Bring the broken heart back to our home

1202
01:31:58,625 --> 01:31:59,958
You like hot and steamy liver?

1203
01:32:01,666 --> 01:32:05,750
I guess it's gonna be
hot and steamy all night.

1204
01:32:06,625 --> 01:32:08,125
Kidding.
