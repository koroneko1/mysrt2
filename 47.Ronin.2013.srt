1
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,217
<i>Ancient feudal Japan,
a land shrouded in mystery,</i>

2
00:00:51,218 --> 00:00:53,252
<i>forbidden to foreigners.</i>

3
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:57,165
<i>A group of magical islands
home to witches and demons.</i>

4
00:00:58,158 --> 00:01:00,226
<i>A nation of rival provinces</i>

5
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,798
<i>whose lords were ruled by a
shogun whose will is absolute.</i>

6
00:01:06,533 --> 00:01:09,569
<i>Peace in the realm is
kept by the samurai,</i>

7
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,671
<i>master swordsmen</i>

8
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:13,606
<i>tasked with protecting their lord</i>

9
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,778
<i>and their province at all costs.</i>

10
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:19,845
<i>Should a samurai ever
lose or fail his master,</i>

11
00:01:19,846 --> 00:01:24,050
<i>he suffers the greatest shame
in all Japanese society.</i>

12
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:26,290
<i>He becomes a ronin.</i>

13
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,890
<i>And yet, to know the
story of the 47 Ronin,</i>

14
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,528
<i>is to know the story of all Japan.</i>

15
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,003
<i>It began with a boy.</i>

16
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:45,141
<i>No one knew where he came from
or how he found his way to Ako.</i>

17
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,314
<i>Some said he was a changeling,
no better than a beast.</i>

18
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:56,388
<i>Many believed he'd been
raised by the Tengu,</i>

19
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,188
<i>the demons of the forest</i>

20
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,327
<i>who had taught him
their dark powers</i>

21
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,663
<i>and trained him in their
lethal arts of killing.</i>

22
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:13,708
<i>The evil he had fled had
left its mark upon him.</i>

23
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,783
Oishi!

24
00:02:30,417 --> 00:02:32,758
My Lord, it is a demon.

25
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:47,542
He's a child, just like you.

26
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:51,314
Help me pick him up, Oishi.

27
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:55,880
<i>Lord Asano, of the province Ako,</i>

28
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,444
<i>saved him that day,</i>

29
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:02,254
<i>seeing something in the
boy that Oishi did not.</i>

30
00:03:07,454 --> 00:03:12,060
<i>Lord Asano's daughter,
Mike, saw it too.</i>

31
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:32,578
<i>Mika's father allowed the
boy to live amongst them,</i>

32
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:34,750
<i>against the advice of his samurai.</i>

33
00:03:38,018 --> 00:03:39,188
Look.

34
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,624
What do you see?

35
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,323
A branch?

36
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,091
No.

37
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,305
It's a deer.

38
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:50,696
Oh.

39
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:52,003
It took this path.

40
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,653
You keep it, Kai.

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,848
<i>The samurai believed his presence</i>

42
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:11,020
<i>would bring misfortune
to their land.</i>

43
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:15,732
<i>Mika only saw a gentle boy.</i>

44
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:20,226
<i>Although he lived as an outcast,</i>

45
00:04:20,227 --> 00:04:22,428
<i>Kai was determined
to repay the love</i>

46
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:25,097
he received from
Mike and her father,

47
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,541
<i>whatever the cost.</i>

48
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,559
Kai.

49
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:50,428
Well?

50
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:52,170
There is something wrong
with the creature.

51
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,340
It's up there on the rise, but
it will come down again to hunt.

52
00:04:56,429 --> 00:04:59,032
It would be safer to set a
trap and wait for it here.

53
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:09,414
It's up on the rise, Lord Asano.

54
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:05,164
My Lord.

55
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,403
Kill it!

56
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:49,665
I would rather have been killed by
that beast than saved by a half-breed.

57
00:08:58,405 --> 00:09:00,246
Yasuno!

58
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:23,034
Ako owes you a great debt, Yasuno.

59
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,609
We can finally welcome
the Shogun without fear.

60
00:09:39,512 --> 00:09:41,489
For Ako!

61
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:43,126
For Ako!

62
00:09:44,217 --> 00:09:45,625
Well done.

63
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:36,936
Get out.

64
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:41,343
Get out!

65
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:04,768
Does Lord Asano live?

66
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,935
Yes.

67
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:10,540
Mmm.

68
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,954
Hosting the Shogun's tournament

69
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:30,789
is a great honor for my father.

70
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,597
Everything must be perfect.

71
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,796
My Lady, Mika.

72
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:37,563
Lord Asano and the hunting
party have returned.

73
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,505
They killed the beast.

74
00:11:55,815 --> 00:11:56,916
Father!

75
00:11:59,152 --> 00:12:00,697
I was worried.

76
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,200
The hunt took longer than we hoped.

77
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:06,267
Yasuno showed great courage.

78
00:12:08,161 --> 00:12:09,763
Is anyone badly hurt?

79
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,944
Who are you looking for?

80
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,282
Is everything prepared for
the Shogun's arrival?

81
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:26,185
Yes, Father.

82
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,851
I want all of Ako
to share in this honor

83
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,626
of hosting our great commander.

84
00:12:36,022 --> 00:12:37,556
I have made special arrangements

85
00:12:37,557 --> 00:12:39,398
for the visiting lords, as well.

86
00:12:45,465 --> 00:12:49,138
I've ordered stands put
up all along the route.

87
00:12:51,037 --> 00:12:53,083
Your mother would have been proud.

88
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,495
I was worried.

89
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:15,501
You always worry.

90
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,502
He so wants your approval.

91
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:26,412
Chikara has been training
every chance he gets.

92
00:13:38,918 --> 00:13:41,692
My Lady, Kai has returned.

93
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:16,155
They told me you were hurt.

94
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:18,232
It's nothing, My Lady.

95
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,735
Your back.

96
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,733
Sit down.

97
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:36,819
Someone should have
seen to this before.

98
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:48,989
Thank you.

99
00:14:56,429 --> 00:15:00,636
I saw the shame in Yasuno's eyes
when they were praising him.

100
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:05,639
Even when you try to help
them, they hate you.

101
00:15:06,372 --> 00:15:10,215
Your father's samurai have always
treated me as well as can be expected.

102
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,783
And is that all you expect?

103
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,792
It's all I know.

104
00:15:19,018 --> 00:15:21,462
It doesn't have to be, Kai.

105
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,366
This is no place for you, My Lady.

106
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,710
Are you sending me away?

107
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,141
Look at me and tell
me you don't love me.

108
00:15:43,142 --> 00:15:44,585
I will always love you.

109
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,748
But you have your place

110
00:15:48,714 --> 00:15:50,521
and I have mine.

111
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,930
Asano <i>Takumi no Kami,</i> ruler of Ako.

112
00:17:02,788 --> 00:17:05,123
His Highness, Shogun Tokugawa,

113
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:08,933
lord of provinces and
master of all Japan

114
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:11,806
thanks you for your welcome.

115
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,774
Lord Asano,

116
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,507
my friend.

117
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,009
Ako is magnificent,

118
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,909
as always.

119
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:26,685
We anticipate with pleasure
tomorrows tournament.

120
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,617
Great Shogun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi...

121
00:17:45,398 --> 00:17:48,600
and hope the entertainment
we have prepared

122
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:50,703
meets your august approval.

123
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:55,844
Father.

124
00:17:57,176 --> 00:17:59,051
What are you doing in my home?

125
00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,448
Last week at the hunt I saw a fox.

126
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:06,219
I didn't realize at the
time that it was a witch.

127
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,119
A witch?

128
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,056
I believe I saw the same
creature again tonight.

129
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:14,195
She was in human form among
the nobles' concubines.

130
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:17,664
My Lord.

131
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:26,705
They say only demons have the power

132
00:18:26,706 --> 00:18:29,343
to see past a witch's disguise.

133
00:18:32,211 --> 00:18:33,915
Are you a demon?

134
00:18:35,881 --> 00:18:36,982
No.

135
00:18:39,385 --> 00:18:43,160
Then I suggest you are simply
bewitched by a beautiful girl.

136
00:18:56,235 --> 00:19:00,511
Lord Asano, may we
present Lord Kira Yoshinaka,

137
00:19:00,573 --> 00:19:03,847
master of Nagato, from
the northern provinces.

138
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:20,563
Ako is as beautiful as I
remember, Lord Asano.

139
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,863
We are honored by your
visit, Lord Kira.

140
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,872
I look forward to the tournament.

141
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,888
I had no idea your concubine
was so lovely, Lord Asano.

142
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,063
She's my daughter.

143
00:19:51,457 --> 00:19:52,558
Oh.

144
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,669
Forgive me, My Lady.

145
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:59,239
May I ask that your
daughter sit with us?

146
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:02,438
I should like to make
up for my rudeness.

147
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,147
Father, who is that?

148
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,492
My fighter.

149
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:32,332
I'm sure your father's champion
will be an even contest.

150
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:35,699
Yasuno.

151
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:42,835
Yasuno. Yasuno!

152
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:44,169
Yasuno!

153
00:21:48,774 --> 00:21:49,875
What's wrong with him?

154
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,248
Witchcraft

155
00:21:52,745 --> 00:21:53,846
Get your father.

156
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,852
There is no time.

157
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:03,731
If we have no fighter,

158
00:22:04,123 --> 00:22:05,896
Ako will be disgraced.

159
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,302
Only a samurai can fight.

160
00:22:19,305 --> 00:22:20,406
Enough.

161
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:24,647
Your fighter?

162
00:23:01,747 --> 00:23:04,293
Champions, prepare for combat!

163
00:23:05,484 --> 00:23:06,927
Bring them steel!

164
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,991
Stop!

165
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:41,354
You are not a samurai.

166
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:46,759
Kill it.

167
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:49,354
No!

168
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,227
No!

169
00:24:54,927 --> 00:24:56,938
Forgive me, My Lord.

170
00:24:57,262 --> 00:25:00,070
The fault is mine.

171
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,059
Strip him of his armor.

172
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,426
Beat him.

173
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,541
Stop!

174
00:26:20,045 --> 00:26:21,215
I'm sorry.

175
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,019
My Lord!

176
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:29,961
Not now!

177
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,803
Father, please!

178
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:57,993
Lord Asano's mind is unsettled.

179
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:01,657
It is time to take Ako.

180
00:27:02,154 --> 00:27:06,498
It is what you hoped for, it
is what we have planned for.

181
00:27:07,259 --> 00:27:09,737
What are you afraid of, My Lord?

182
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:14,935
Show me your courage.

183
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:18,210
Give me your heart.

184
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:23,081
After this, there
is no turning back.

185
00:27:23,942 --> 00:27:28,013
You are bound to me, and I to you.

186
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,587
Rivers of blood

187
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,965
and mountains of corpses

188
00:27:38,757 --> 00:27:41,565
will not stand in our way.

189
00:27:42,528 --> 00:27:45,370
Nor the tears of widows.

190
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:49,437
Find your envy and hatred.

191
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:55,911
And I will give you all you desire.

192
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:27,335
Father.

193
00:29:30,569 --> 00:29:32,046
Father!

194
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,315
Father!

195
00:29:41,647 --> 00:29:43,158
Mika.

196
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,151
Father!

197
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,929
Mika.

198
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:51,258
Father!

199
00:29:59,331 --> 00:30:01,001
Father!

200
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,837
Help!

201
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:15,550
What is this?

202
00:30:16,581 --> 00:30:17,748
Stand back!

203
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:18,850
My Lord!

204
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,091
Please!

205
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,025
Father!

206
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,941
Everyone, go back to your posts!

207
00:31:03,895 --> 00:31:06,566
The law is clear.

208
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:11,003
You have struck an unarmed guest
and have shamed your home.

209
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,313
The penalty is death.

210
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:18,452
Because of your rank and the
service you have done Ako,

211
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:22,819
I will allow you to regain your
honor and the honor of your house

212
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:25,083
through seppuku,

213
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:27,695
death by your own hand,

214
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,267
so that you may show courage
and dignity in death

215
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,866
as you once showed in life.

216
00:31:40,499 --> 00:31:44,706
The Shogun could have had
me hanged like a criminal.

217
00:31:46,505 --> 00:31:50,348
Instead, he has allowed me

218
00:31:51,176 --> 00:31:54,849
to take my life with honor.

219
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:58,485
You were bewitched, My Lord.

220
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:00,819
Your mind was poisoned.

221
00:32:01,353 --> 00:32:04,662
If I accept my fate,

222
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:10,133
no one will question the
honor of our people

223
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,968
or punish them for my crime.

224
00:32:14,466 --> 00:32:15,567
Promise me

225
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:21,811
you will protect Mika and
Ako from our enemies.

226
00:32:22,207 --> 00:32:23,650
My Lord.

227
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:30,549
I am ready, Oishi.

228
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:32,822
And when I die,

229
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:37,926
I would be honored if you
would act as my second,

230
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:40,694
my friend.

231
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,015
Father!

232
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,955
Don't let them see you cry.

233
00:35:23,388 --> 00:35:24,762
No.

234
00:35:26,725 --> 00:35:28,031
We must have revenge.

235
00:35:29,227 --> 00:35:31,929
Whatever the cost, it is our duty.

236
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:34,510
My Lord, what will you have us do?

237
00:35:39,738 --> 00:35:42,512
If we fight now, we die.

238
00:35:43,942 --> 00:35:45,943
And not just us.

239
00:35:45,944 --> 00:35:49,116
Every farmer and villager
in Ako will be killed.

240
00:35:50,749 --> 00:35:52,590
We have to think of them first.

241
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:04,769
Poison, My Lady.
It will end your pain.

242
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:10,373
We have not lost Ako yet.

243
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:45,675
Your Highness.

244
00:37:13,164 --> 00:37:14,538
Lady Asano,

245
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:19,305
I am sorry for your father's death.

246
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:21,772
He accepted it with dignity.

247
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:25,876
Your Highness, as my
father's only child,

248
00:37:25,877 --> 00:37:30,790
I ask that I may look after his
lands until such time as I marry.

249
00:37:31,516 --> 00:37:33,960
I have already considered
this, My Lady.

250
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:47,598
So that there will be no
feud between your clans,

251
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,339
I decree that from this day,

252
00:37:50,735 --> 00:37:52,337
they will be one.

253
00:37:53,138 --> 00:37:56,981
Sealed by the marriage bond
between you and Lord Kira.

254
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,154
You are granted one year to mourn.

255
00:38:00,378 --> 00:38:04,858
But you will remain a guest of
Lord Kira's until you are married.

256
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,050
Oishi.

257
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,993
You are now ronin.

258
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,160
Masterless samurai.

259
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,503
I forbid you to seek vengeance
for Lord Asano's death.

260
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,600
Lord Kira,

261
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:26,510
I leave Ako with you.

262
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:49,693
From this moment on, you are
banished from these lands.

263
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:52,434
Those who remain
will be hunted down

264
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:56,470
and executed.

265
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,828
You will never see him again,
My Lady. Take a last look.

266
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,653
I don't trust Oishi.

267
00:39:49,654 --> 00:39:52,496
He no longer has the
protection of his rank.

268
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:54,159
Throw him in the pit.

269
00:39:54,592 --> 00:39:56,330
Break his will.

270
00:41:02,327 --> 00:41:03,497
Father!

271
00:41:04,562 --> 00:41:05,663
Father.

272
00:41:06,931 --> 00:41:09,099
Get away! Get away from me.

273
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,180
Chikara, help him up.

274
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,860
Where are my men?

275
00:41:28,353 --> 00:41:30,194
They have all left Ako.

276
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:33,430
And Lady Asano?

277
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:37,806
Her time of mourning
is almost over.

278
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:41,136
Lord Kira took her to his castle

279
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,438
to begin preparing
for their wedding.

280
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,037
Chikara,

281
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,382
what of the half-breed?

282
00:41:51,442 --> 00:41:56,651
Kira's men took him to the Dutch
island and sold him into slavery.

283
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,229
We need three horses.

284
00:42:13,498 --> 00:42:14,736
Now.

285
00:42:24,976 --> 00:42:26,077
Riku.

286
00:42:29,647 --> 00:42:33,991
You must make the whole world
believe you've divorced me.

287
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:39,696
It is the only way to protect
you from what I have to do.

288
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:47,933
No one but you and I
can know that you are,

289
00:42:47,999 --> 00:42:50,045
and will always be,

290
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:54,780
the joy of my life.

291
00:42:57,942 --> 00:43:00,613
I am the wife of a samurai.

292
00:43:03,347 --> 00:43:07,122
Whatever your duty is,
it is mine too.

293
00:43:17,862 --> 00:43:18,963
Show them this

294
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:22,834
and tell them to meet me at
the black lake in a week.

295
00:43:23,801 --> 00:43:27,542
Remember, the enemy
will be watching.

296
00:44:10,014 --> 00:44:12,060
Hey, stranger.

297
00:44:14,452 --> 00:44:16,031
What's your business here?

298
00:44:17,955 --> 00:44:20,035
I'm looking for a half-breed.

299
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:28,706
Good luck, samurai!

300
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:09,839
Half-breed! Half-breed! Half-breed!

301
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,452
Kai!

302
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:50,456
It's Oishi.

303
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:53,617
Kai!

304
00:46:01,759 --> 00:46:02,860
It's me!

305
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:19,553
Kai! Lady Asano.

306
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,412
Mika.

307
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,489
She needs your help.

308
00:46:30,721 --> 00:46:32,994
Half-breed! Half-breed! Half-breed!

309
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:38,062
Kai! Soon Kira will marry Mika.

310
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:40,505
We must stop him!
Are you with me?

311
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,455
Now!

312
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:15,761
Lady Asano is to be
married in a week.

313
00:48:16,394 --> 00:48:18,098
What do you care?

314
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:20,774
When Kira took her away,
you were on your knees.

315
00:48:21,165 --> 00:48:24,371
We would have all been killed.
You too.

316
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,012
What use are you to her dead?

317
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:29,974
What use am I to you?

318
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:37,115
Either follow me or go
back to what you were.

319
00:48:37,181 --> 00:48:38,848
Don't turn your back on me, ronin.

320
00:48:40,785 --> 00:48:42,387
Follow you for what?

321
00:48:47,558 --> 00:48:50,639
Kira has 1,000 men
under his command.

322
00:48:51,729 --> 00:48:56,141
He's also protected by witchcraft.

323
00:48:57,701 --> 00:48:59,536
When I told you that,
you turned me away.

324
00:48:59,537 --> 00:49:00,638
I was wrong.

325
00:49:03,374 --> 00:49:05,351
I failed my lord.

326
00:49:09,747 --> 00:49:12,259
I don't know who or what you are,

327
00:49:13,751 --> 00:49:15,853
but I need your help.

328
00:49:26,063 --> 00:49:27,198
Clothes.

329
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:47,960
I'll come with you,

330
00:49:48,018 --> 00:49:51,031
but if you ever kneel before
Kira again, I'll take your head.

331
00:50:02,099 --> 00:50:04,201
Where did you learn
to fight like that?

332
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:06,545
From demons.

333
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:53,920
My Lord, forgive me.

334
00:50:53,984 --> 00:50:56,928
The half-breed has escaped
from the Dutch island.

335
00:50:57,555 --> 00:50:59,657
They say a samurai helped him.

336
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:05,035
Oishi.

337
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,678
Find Oishi. I need him dead.

338
00:51:41,732 --> 00:51:43,209
Yasuno, it's Oishi!

339
00:51:45,636 --> 00:51:46,874
He's back!

340
00:51:46,904 --> 00:51:48,184
Everyone, Oishi's back!

341
00:51:48,305 --> 00:51:50,009
Oishi's back!

342
00:52:05,823 --> 00:52:06,889
Father.

343
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,060
Well done, Chikara.

344
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:28,883
Today we may be ronin,

345
00:52:29,647 --> 00:52:32,956
but now the time has come.

346
00:52:33,851 --> 00:52:37,364
What I propose ends in death.

347
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:41,096
Even if we succeed,

348
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:47,303
we will be hanged as criminals
for defying the Shogun's orders.

349
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,715
I take a vow before you

350
00:52:54,471 --> 00:52:58,485
that I will not rest
until justice is done,

351
00:52:59,677 --> 00:53:02,917
will not sleep until our
master lies in peace,

352
00:53:03,547 --> 00:53:05,058
and will not pray

353
00:53:05,449 --> 00:53:09,326
unless it is to ask the
heavens' forgiveness

354
00:53:09,386 --> 00:53:11,397
for sending Kira to hell!

355
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:28,643
There are only two ways in.

356
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:30,509
The main gate here

357
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:33,085
and this point beneath
the west wall.

358
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:35,415
Both are heavily guarded.

359
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:39,994
Our best chance is to strike when Kira
leaves the safety of his fortress.

360
00:53:40,084 --> 00:53:44,155
He will travel to his ancestors'
shrine to offer prayers.

361
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:47,090
We don't know yet when he
will make the journey.

362
00:53:47,091 --> 00:53:51,327
Isogai, you ride ahead
to his temple town

363
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,839
and see what you can find out.

364
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:56,000
Remember, even near holy sites

365
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,875
there are brothels and plenty of
loose-tongued officials who visit them.

366
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:04,483
Even if we know the route, we
will need more men for an ambush.

367
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:06,518
Then we'll get them.

368
00:54:06,577 --> 00:54:08,850
You and Chuzaemon and Okuda

369
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,856
will gather as many of our
former samurai as you can

370
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:14,996
and meet us here at a farmhouse
Horibe has found for us.

371
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:21,133
Forgive me, sir, but how can we
succeed without good swords?

372
00:54:22,192 --> 00:54:23,327
Take mine.

373
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:27,738
When we meet again, I'll
have more waiting for you.

374
00:54:29,533 --> 00:54:32,307
The rest of us will go to Uetsu.

375
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:34,847
The finest swordmakers
in the land work there.

376
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:36,807
Why is the half-breed here?

377
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,879
I asked him to come.

378
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:44,557
We can't take him with us.
He's not a samurai.

379
00:54:50,053 --> 00:54:52,895
None of us are samurai anymore.

380
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:53,653
Who are you?

381
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:57,054
We are farmers from Shimobe, sir.

382
00:55:57,788 --> 00:55:59,629
We have come to buy tools.

383
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:02,799
This is Lord Kira's village now.

384
00:56:20,644 --> 00:56:23,122
These are not farmer's hands.

385
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:58,148
Take the swords,
whatever you can salvage.

386
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,786
We'll need more.

387
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:03,992
Help him.

388
00:57:13,797 --> 00:57:15,968
Eat, My Lady.

389
00:57:27,711 --> 00:57:30,382
You think I care if you starve?

390
00:57:31,048 --> 00:57:34,322
Soon my lord will be
ruler of all Japan

391
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:38,497
and you can take your life
like your father did.

392
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:40,663
You killed my father.

393
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:44,435
Weren't you the one
who broke his heart?

394
00:57:45,562 --> 00:57:48,336
You betrayed him with your lust.

395
00:58:05,749 --> 00:58:10,025
We can go to Hida.
They will give us weapons.

396
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:12,758
You will find nothing in Hida.

397
00:58:13,357 --> 00:58:16,461
Kira's men will have taken
over this entire region.

398
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,770
There is another way.

399
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:24,042
You will find swords
in the Sea of Trees.

400
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:26,711
The Tengu Forest

401
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,048
That is just a myth.

402
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:33,953
I've seen them.

403
00:58:54,398 --> 00:58:56,569
How do you know about
the Tengu Forest?

404
00:58:57,801 --> 00:59:01,144
I was raised there
before I fled to Ako.

405
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,843
Those scars on your head.

406
00:59:05,075 --> 00:59:07,587
Are they the ones who marked you?

407
00:59:08,812 --> 00:59:09,947
Yes.

408
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,149
And taught you to fight?

409
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:14,022
To kill.

410
00:59:14,084 --> 00:59:16,186
They have many strange
and magical ways

411
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,321
to protect themselves
and their beliefs.

412
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:24,336
They wanted to show me that this
life has nothing to offer but death.

413
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:30,603
They wanted me to be like
them and renounce the world.

414
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:35,306
I vowed never to use the
magical powers they taught me.

415
00:59:35,372 --> 00:59:40,148
Although I was still a child, I knew
my place was among other men.

416
00:59:41,945 --> 00:59:45,822
And do you think that these
Tengu would give us weapons?

417
00:59:48,718 --> 00:59:50,661
They will test our will.

418
01:00:12,042 --> 01:00:14,918
My wife just won't stop nagging me.

419
01:00:14,978 --> 01:00:18,992
She wants me to find her the best
view of Lord Kim's procession.

420
01:00:19,049 --> 01:00:21,390
Procession? What procession?

421
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:24,191
Nobody knows when Kira
will leave his fortress,

422
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:25,890
not even his own guards.

423
01:00:26,056 --> 01:00:28,864
He will hurry back
before anyone is awake.

424
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,606
What is your name?

425
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:43,211
Yuki.

426
01:00:44,074 --> 01:00:46,677
Where do you come from, Yuki?

427
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,198
You've come back.

428
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,878
Are we lost?

429
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:17,382
No. They know we're here.

430
01:01:20,610 --> 01:01:22,511
What is that noise?

431
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,613
Ghosts.

432
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:28,124
Spirits of the old and infirm
who are left hereto die.

433
01:01:30,787 --> 01:01:32,833
Unwanted children, too.

434
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,266
Only you.

435
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,228
I'm coming with you.

436
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,364
No.

437
01:02:15,999 --> 01:02:17,134
Do as he says.

438
01:02:19,169 --> 01:02:20,373
Stay here.

439
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:51,335
Whatever happens in there,
whatever you see,

440
01:02:52,102 --> 01:02:53,977
don't draw your weapon.

441
01:03:13,957 --> 01:03:15,331
Wait here.

442
01:03:25,068 --> 01:03:28,445
How do we know the half-breed
hasn't led him into a trap?

443
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,046
Oishi trusts him.

444
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:34,177
Of course, he has no choice.
We need weapons.

445
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:39,356
If he doesn't come back soon,

446
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:43,225
I'm going after him.

447
01:04:18,621 --> 01:04:22,225
So the terrified boy
returns as a man.

448
01:04:24,327 --> 01:04:26,304
I have come for your help.

449
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:28,675
We are in need of swords.

450
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:31,468
Then take it.

451
01:04:34,471 --> 01:04:39,179
These swords were forged to defend
us against the hatred of men.

452
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:43,651
Men who persecuted
us for our beliefs.

453
01:04:44,180 --> 01:04:47,750
The same men who despise
you for being different.

454
01:04:49,853 --> 01:04:52,490
And now you're here to help them.

455
01:04:52,856 --> 01:04:54,958
They are good men.

456
01:04:55,024 --> 01:04:56,603
Their cause is just.

457
01:04:58,428 --> 01:05:01,338
Many come for our steel,

458
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:04,274
but none return.

459
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:08,843
You told him not to draw his sword.

460
01:05:10,507 --> 01:05:12,211
If he does,

461
01:05:12,942 --> 01:05:16,455
he and all his men will die.

462
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:24,063
Was it worth it? What you
found in the outside world?

463
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:28,825
The love of a woman
you can never have?

464
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:30,827
Yes.

465
01:05:33,963 --> 01:05:36,634
Let me tell you of love, Kai.

466
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,809
The love of one night

467
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,313
that brought you into this world.

468
01:05:42,539 --> 01:05:46,553
An English sailor
and a peasant girl.

469
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:53,058
Your loving mother abandoned
you to die in these woods.

470
01:05:53,149 --> 01:05:56,560
A monster, a half-breed child.

471
01:05:58,087 --> 01:06:00,030
Yet we found you,

472
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:04,161
accepted you, trained you.

473
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:08,706
We taught you many things.

474
01:06:09,599 --> 01:06:11,576
But you fled

475
01:06:11,734 --> 01:06:14,838
and you turned your
back on those gifts.

476
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:17,342
Gifts of death.

477
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:19,009
No matter what you do,

478
01:06:20,276 --> 01:06:23,619
Mika will never be
yours in this life.

479
01:06:25,615 --> 01:06:29,686
Then I will go to my death and
pray I find her in the next.

480
01:06:32,255 --> 01:06:33,356
Sir?

481
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:41,872
What are you doing here?

482
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:44,140
I told you to stay.

483
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,080
No! Yasuno!

484
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:05,729
<i>Draw your sword.</i>

485
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,734
<i>Save them.</i>

486
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:14,331
<i>Draw your sword.</i>

487
01:07:16,666 --> 01:07:18,074
<i>Save them.</i>

488
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:22,174
<i>Draw your sword.</i>

489
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:27,447
<i>Save your men!</i>

490
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:34,760
No more talk.

491
01:07:36,185 --> 01:07:38,424
Will you give me what I ask?

492
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,658
Take the blade, Kai.

493
01:07:41,925 --> 01:07:43,868
If you can reach it before me.

494
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,133
<i>Save your men. Help them.</i>

495
01:08:00,043 --> 01:08:02,123
<i>Draw your sword, Oishi.</i>

496
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:07,316
<i>Save them.</i>

497
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,191
Chikara!

498
01:08:26,269 --> 01:08:29,248
A gift not forgotten.

499
01:08:48,992 --> 01:08:51,231
You passed their test.

500
01:08:51,294 --> 01:08:53,101
Your men are safe.

501
01:08:53,997 --> 01:08:56,008
You've got your swords.

502
01:09:09,579 --> 01:09:12,455
What's so special
about these swords?

503
01:09:12,515 --> 01:09:14,288
What do they do?

504
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:17,258
It depends.

505
01:09:17,954 --> 01:09:19,192
On what?

506
01:09:20,523 --> 01:09:21,761
Who uses them.

507
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:28,934
What about a tall, strong,
brave man like me?

508
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:37,717
They cut.

509
01:09:54,991 --> 01:09:56,934
I think mine is broken.

510
01:10:21,651 --> 01:10:22,752
Your sword.

511
01:10:22,852 --> 01:10:25,933
You keep it, Hazama.
I told you we'd bring others.

512
01:10:40,503 --> 01:10:42,276
I have the information
you requested.

513
01:10:42,572 --> 01:10:45,846
Lord Kira leaves for his
ancestors' shrine tonight.

514
01:10:47,910 --> 01:10:49,045
Well done.

515
01:10:49,112 --> 01:10:51,954
Come, Isogai. Gather the men.

516
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:53,855
Father.

517
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:57,297
I want to go with you.

518
01:10:58,020 --> 01:10:59,121
No.

519
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:01,624
Horibe, stay with him.

520
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:38,237
I ride to my ancestors' shrine
to offer thanks for our wedding.

521
01:11:38,728 --> 01:11:41,035
Is there anything you
wish me to pray for?

522
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:44,538
My Lord will not like my answer.

523
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:47,438
You may look down on me, My Lady,

524
01:11:47,770 --> 01:11:51,579
but our children and their
children will be of one blood.

525
01:12:16,766 --> 01:12:18,368
Take care, Hazama.

526
01:12:46,629 --> 01:12:48,106
Sorry.

527
01:12:51,634 --> 01:12:54,803
It's a trap! Go! Go!

528
01:12:54,804 --> 01:12:57,316
Get back! Get back!

529
01:12:58,641 --> 01:12:59,776
Get out!

530
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:17,927
Yasuno!

531
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:20,830
Yasuno!

532
01:13:37,246 --> 01:13:39,952
Oishi, help me!
It's Basho.

533
01:13:40,683 --> 01:13:41,853
Hazama!

534
01:13:51,394 --> 01:13:52,495
- No!
- Oishi!

535
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:32,240
It belonged to Oishi, My Lord.

536
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,628
Your half-breed is dead.

537
01:14:55,324 --> 01:14:58,564
So are dozens of your father's men.

538
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,534
All killed

539
01:15:02,665 --> 01:15:04,904
trying to save you.

540
01:15:08,604 --> 01:15:12,880
Perhaps now you understand

541
01:15:13,609 --> 01:15:15,780
the price of your love.

542
01:15:21,450 --> 01:15:23,791
I promised my lord

543
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:27,961
I would not harm

544
01:15:28,958 --> 01:15:31,595
a hair on your head.

545
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:42,182
But what you do to yourself

546
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:46,076
is not my concern.

547
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:06,531
Good night.

548
01:16:58,614 --> 01:17:00,022
Kai.

549
01:17:00,950 --> 01:17:03,826
I have a confession to make.

550
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:07,388
When I was a boy,

551
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:11,665
I used to wait in the
woods outside your hut,

552
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,671
and when you came out,

553
01:17:16,732 --> 01:17:20,109
I'd throw stones at you,

554
01:17:20,302 --> 01:17:22,439
then hide.

555
01:17:26,075 --> 01:17:28,121
I knew it was you.

556
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:32,083
I could see your belly sticking
out from behind the trees.

557
01:17:43,526 --> 01:17:44,969
I'm sorry, Kai.

558
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:48,197
You're a good man.

559
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:20,232
I should have acted the
day Lord Asano died.

560
01:18:21,797 --> 01:18:24,741
Our anger should have
been sudden and swift.

561
01:18:26,635 --> 01:18:29,181
Then even if we'd failed,

562
01:18:32,308 --> 01:18:34,479
it would have been with honor.

563
01:18:47,389 --> 01:18:48,991
You are samurai.

564
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:54,765
We still have swords and
the advantage of surprise.

565
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:58,606
Kira thinks we're ghosts.

566
01:18:59,602 --> 01:19:02,649
We can use that,
turn it to our advantage.

567
01:19:04,206 --> 01:19:05,979
He'll never expect us.

568
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:11,181
We can still do what we came for.

569
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:35,907
Eat.

570
01:19:38,040 --> 01:19:39,983
- Your arm?
- Fine.

571
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:57,527
Go get your father.

572
01:20:14,977 --> 01:20:16,078
Stay where you are!

573
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,616
What is this?

574
01:20:21,617 --> 01:20:25,927
We are not some village troupe
to be held up by bandits.

575
01:20:26,088 --> 01:20:29,965
Lord Kira himself has hired us
to perform at his wedding.

576
01:20:30,125 --> 01:20:33,194
I have the letters and
passes to prove it.

577
01:20:33,195 --> 01:20:34,433
There is no need.

578
01:20:35,331 --> 01:20:37,411
We saw you perform in Ako.

579
01:20:40,803 --> 01:20:42,974
You are Lord Asano's men.

580
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:46,710
We need your help.

581
01:20:52,381 --> 01:20:53,482
Kai.

582
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:05,960
Forgive me for not thanking
you for defeating the beast

583
01:21:05,961 --> 01:21:07,267
and saving my life.

584
01:21:10,366 --> 01:21:14,004
A samurai does not take credit
for victories of others.

585
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:22,486
This belonged to Basho.

586
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,457
A samurai wears two swords.

587
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:40,437
<i>When a crime goes unpunished,</i>

588
01:21:41,196 --> 01:21:43,503
the world is unbalanced.

589
01:21:44,066 --> 01:21:46,305
When a wrong is unavenged,

590
01:21:46,535 --> 01:21:49,275
the heavens look
down on us in shame.

591
01:21:50,839 --> 01:21:55,046
<i>We too must die for this circle
of vengeance to be closed.</i>

592
01:22:02,117 --> 01:22:05,586
<i>We will leave this
record of our courage</i>

593
01:22:05,587 --> 01:22:10,136
<i>so the world will know who
we were and what we did.</i>

594
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:23,910
<i>Tonight we will regain our honor</i>

595
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,581
<i>and avenge our lord.</i>

596
01:22:31,647 --> 01:22:35,194
<i>None of us knows
how long he shall five</i>

597
01:22:35,317 --> 01:22:37,829
<i>or when his time will come.</i>

598
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:44,001
<i>But soon all that will be
left of our brief lives</i>

599
01:22:44,460 --> 01:22:49,737
<i>is the pride our children feel
when they speak our names.</i>

600
01:23:00,309 --> 01:23:01,410
Kai.

601
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:35,117
We end this now.

602
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:49,063
Now

603
01:23:50,626 --> 01:23:52,899
we are 47.

604
01:24:03,005 --> 01:24:04,106
What do you see?

605
01:24:07,075 --> 01:24:08,813
The omens are good.

606
01:24:09,011 --> 01:24:11,751
Soon you will travel far.

607
01:24:12,581 --> 01:24:17,255
In every town and village,
people shall bow before you.

608
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:28,332
Halt!

609
01:24:52,354 --> 01:24:53,455
Let them through.

610
01:26:12,801 --> 01:26:14,380
Five minutes!

611
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:42,233
Lord Kira, we are proud
to present to you

612
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:45,904
our performance as a
gift for your wedding.

613
01:30:16,011 --> 01:30:17,784
Don't hurt the princess!

614
01:30:31,693 --> 01:30:32,794
Kai!

615
01:31:02,924 --> 01:31:04,230
Get them!

616
01:31:51,039 --> 01:31:52,550
Stay there!

617
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:15,734
I knew you'd come for me.

618
01:33:16,191 --> 01:33:18,635
Nothing will ever keep
me away from you.

619
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:41,587
Nothing, half-breed?

620
01:33:43,218 --> 01:33:44,388
Even death?

621
01:33:45,053 --> 01:33:46,359
I know what you are.

622
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,432
You have no idea.

623
01:33:49,491 --> 01:33:51,161
I'm not afraid of you.

624
01:33:52,127 --> 01:33:53,706
You should be.

625
01:35:27,689 --> 01:35:28,859
Come on.

626
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:19,515
Know now the depth
of my lord's courage.

627
01:37:46,961 --> 01:37:49,940
In the name of Lord Asano of Ako!

628
01:38:09,984 --> 01:38:11,757
For Lord Asano!

629
01:40:05,633 --> 01:40:06,939
Chikara.

630
01:40:48,009 --> 01:40:50,111
Rest now, My Lord.

631
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:53,621
You are avenged.

632
01:41:01,556 --> 01:41:03,658
Oishi,

633
01:41:03,724 --> 01:41:07,431
I gave you a command forbidding
you to take revenge.

634
01:41:08,496 --> 01:41:10,598
Forgive me, Your Highness,

635
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:16,980
but a man may not live
under the same heaven

636
01:41:18,072 --> 01:41:20,516
as the murderer of his lord.

637
01:41:24,045 --> 01:41:27,957
All I ask is respect for my men.

638
01:41:29,517 --> 01:41:32,154
They are brave, My Lord.

639
01:41:34,121 --> 01:41:35,700
The bravest I know.

640
01:41:41,062 --> 01:41:43,472
I beg you to let them die

641
01:41:44,365 --> 01:41:46,206
with the dignity they deserve.

642
01:41:53,874 --> 01:41:56,147
For the crime of disobedience,

643
01:41:57,878 --> 01:42:01,653
you should all be executed
as common criminals.

644
01:42:04,051 --> 01:42:05,926
But you and your men

645
01:42:06,420 --> 01:42:09,000
followed the old ways of Bushido

646
01:42:10,558 --> 01:42:11,932
to honor your lord

647
01:42:12,393 --> 01:42:14,530
and to avenge treachery.

648
01:42:22,303 --> 01:42:25,009
I see only samurai before me.

649
01:42:26,741 --> 01:42:29,845
I grant you a samurai's death,

650
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:33,247
to be buried alongside your lord

651
01:42:34,582 --> 01:42:36,184
with honor.

652
01:42:37,752 --> 01:42:41,925
Thank you, Your Highness.

653
01:43:01,776 --> 01:43:04,550
Lady Asano is like her father.

654
01:43:08,783 --> 01:43:12,797
She will make Ako great again.

655
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:16,726
Yes.

656
01:43:18,492 --> 01:43:19,627
I know.

657
01:43:57,198 --> 01:43:59,141
My father told me

658
01:44:00,367 --> 01:44:04,040
this world was only a
preparation for the next,

659
01:44:06,173 --> 01:44:11,484
that all we can ask is that
we leave it having loved

660
01:44:11,545 --> 01:44:13,056
and being loved.

661
01:44:17,551 --> 01:44:21,497
I will search for you
through 1,000 worlds

662
01:44:22,523 --> 01:44:26,298
and 10,000 lifetimes
until I find you.

663
01:44:29,196 --> 01:44:32,004
I will wait for you in all of them.

664
01:45:24,084 --> 01:45:25,424
Wait!

665
01:45:28,589 --> 01:45:30,259
Chikara,

666
01:45:30,791 --> 01:45:32,029
son of Oishi,

667
01:45:32,593 --> 01:45:34,536
step out.

668
01:45:53,681 --> 01:45:55,419
Oishi,

669
01:45:56,183 --> 01:46:00,629
I will not deny our
country your bloodline.

670
01:46:01,622 --> 01:46:03,633
Your son shall live

671
01:46:04,959 --> 01:46:06,470
to serve Ako

672
01:46:08,362 --> 01:46:11,068
as you and your samurai have done.

673
01:47:29,209 --> 01:47:34,190
<i>I will search for you
through 1,000 worlds</i>

674
01:47:34,248 --> 01:47:36,988
<i>and 10,000 lifetimes</i>

675
01:47:38,719 --> 01:47:40,594
<i>until I find you.</i>

676
01:48:11,085 --> 01:48:13,859
<i>The memory of the 47 Ronin</i>

677
01:48:13,921 --> 01:48:18,026
<i>who put duty and justice
before their fear of death</i>

678
01:48:18,092 --> 01:48:20,035
<i>has lived down through
the centuries</i>

679
01:48:20,094 --> 01:48:23,300
<i>as one of the greatest
examples of honor and loyalty</i>

680
01:48:23,364 --> 01:48:25,102
<i>in Japanese culture.</i>
