00:01.229 --> 00:04.564
My mom used to say that everybody
has their something.

00:05.400 --> 00:09.821
A special thing that makes them,
well, them!

00:11.365 --> 00:13.491
For some kids,
their something is sports.

00:13.532 --> 00:14.534
Nice shot!

00:15.868 --> 00:18.371
For some kids,
their something is art.

00:20.456 --> 00:24.086
For some kids,
their something is music.

00:28.340 --> 00:32.134
Maybe not these kids, but, you know,
A for effort.

00:34.304 --> 00:37.932
When I was seven, Mom got sick, and...

00:38.725 --> 00:40.435
then it was just me and Dad.

00:43.145 --> 00:44.939
I thought I had lost everything.

00:47.401 --> 00:50.028
But then, I found my something.

01:10.923 --> 01:13.926
Hey, Nory, I found...

01:14.720 --> 01:16.221
It turns out my something...

01:20.809 --> 01:22.143
was magic.

01:22.393 --> 01:26.231
Upside down now
Oh, no

01:26.481 --> 01:28.566
What's going on here
The world has turned around

01:28.859 --> 01:33.196
Okay! Tomorrow's a big day
and so today is a big deal!

01:33.571 --> 01:37.408
Tomorrow, after waiting six long years,

01:37.825 --> 01:40.328
I head off to Sage Academy.

01:41.747 --> 01:44.833
Where super-awesome magic kids
like myself,

01:44.875 --> 01:48.003
learn how to be super-awesomer
and magic-er.

01:48.753 --> 01:51.547
Could be scary. Could be overwhelming.

01:52.633 --> 01:55.384
Nah, it won't because
I'm not going on my own.

01:55.801 --> 01:59.848
I'm going with my best of BFFs,
the amazing, mystifying,

01:59.890 --> 02:04.144
and also magic-ifying, Reina Carvajal!

02:06.395 --> 02:09.232
"Amazing"? "Mystifying"? "Magic-ifying"?

02:09.274 --> 02:11.902
What? I'm practicing hyping you up.

02:11.943 --> 02:14.905
I need to let that school know
they've got a superstar on their hands!

02:14.947 --> 02:18.616
I'm just trying to make it
through the first semester in one piece.

02:18.658 --> 02:20.285
Are you kidding? We're gonna be great.

02:20.911 --> 02:21.995
Go ahead.

02:22.037 --> 02:24.539
Show everyone how good you are
without any training.

02:24.830 --> 02:26.958
Okay. Okay, ready.

02:27.751 --> 02:30.795
- Any requests?
- You know what I'm gonna say.

02:30.836 --> 02:33.006
- You're gonna say "Sparkle Fireba..."
- Sparkle Fireball!

02:33.048 --> 02:35.759
For sure, no doubt.
It's my favorite.

02:35.800 --> 02:37.718
You say everything I do is your favorite.

02:38.095 --> 02:41.556
Yeah, but Sparkle Fireball
is my favorite favorite.

02:42.348 --> 02:44.977
It's a good one. But it's really hard.

02:46.061 --> 02:50.732
Not for you!
You are a flame-throwing rockstar.

03:06.038 --> 03:07.039
How was that?

03:09.251 --> 03:10.210
It was all right.

03:12.044 --> 03:15.881
If you like incredibly, awesome,
mind-blowing, magical powers!

03:15.924 --> 03:18.343
'Cause you are so good at magic
it's bananas.

03:18.384 --> 03:20.846
You are going to rock Sage so hard.

03:20.887 --> 03:25.475
It's we who are going to rock Sage
so hard. Me and you.

03:26.226 --> 03:28.312
Speaking of. Your turn.

03:29.228 --> 03:32.607
Okay. Okay. Give me a second.
Let me concentrate.

03:37.112 --> 03:38.614
Kitten, kitten, kitten.

03:40.281 --> 03:42.700
Well, this is new.

03:43.368 --> 03:45.662
I'm seeing kitten, of course,
but also...

03:46.537 --> 03:49.124
kangaroo and beaver?

03:53.377 --> 03:55.339
Hey, where'd you get my pencil?

03:59.133 --> 04:04.096
I wish I just had a little more control
over the wacko-animals I turn into.

04:04.347 --> 04:06.934
You're still magic.
That's what matters most.

04:07.893 --> 04:12.231
Yeah, but like,
you just think about fire and... poof!

04:13.732 --> 04:17.192
I think about a cat and I turn into
a terrifying abomination.

04:17.236 --> 04:18.904
That's why we're going to Sage.

04:19.403 --> 04:23.574
They're gonna teach you to be the best
abomination you can be.

04:52.311 --> 04:55.148
Dad, are you sure we're in
the right place?

04:55.189 --> 04:57.525
Is there supposed to be a bus
or something?

04:57.568 --> 04:59.236
This is where they told us to go.

05:00.612 --> 05:01.780
Are you okay?

05:03.155 --> 05:06.867
- I... I might be a little nervous.
- That's natural.

05:07.410 --> 05:09.203
Your mom said she was nervous, too.

05:09.912 --> 05:12.583
She was? But she was so good at magic.

05:12.833 --> 05:15.376
Of course she was nervous!
New things are scary!

05:15.835 --> 05:16.919
But...

05:17.837 --> 05:19.256
I know you're gonna be okay.

05:20.756 --> 05:23.718
Then you know what?
I know I'm gonna be okay, too.

05:24.927 --> 05:26.971
- You know what else?
- What else?

05:29.515 --> 05:33.352
- You're going to magic school!
- I'm going to magic school!

05:47.075 --> 05:48.327
What's happening?

05:50.037 --> 05:54.958
Something awesome, right?
Some kind of magical amazing, something.

05:56.876 --> 06:00.547
Hey, come on, let's go!
The school's not gonna walk to you!

06:00.881 --> 06:03.049
Bye-bye parents!
See you at Thanksgiving.

06:03.717 --> 06:06.678
Adios! Sayonara! Au revoir!

06:06.720 --> 06:11.015
Catch you later! Ciao! TTYL! Bye!

06:11.390 --> 06:15.604
Okay, come on, here we go,
no time to waste, can't stop for anything.

06:15.645 --> 06:16.979
Oh, except this.

06:17.313 --> 06:19.857
So, clap, clap, clap.
You can all do magic

06:19.900 --> 06:21.109
Big whoop, I get it.

06:21.484 --> 06:24.612
That's why you're going to magic school,
where you'll be up to your magical butts

06:24.655 --> 06:27.366
in magical magic
for the next six magical years.

06:27.407 --> 06:32.204
But, like, the one rule
of this little nature hike is no magic.

06:32.246 --> 06:34.664
Okay? Here we go, come on!

06:37.292 --> 06:38.292
Bye, Dad!

06:44.633 --> 06:49.179
Okay, hello! Noisy, magic children,
please, keep your voices down,

06:49.220 --> 06:53.100
as there are mystical creatures
and vicious monsterlings out there.

06:53.140 --> 06:56.477
We don't want them jumping out
and tearing you all limb for limb.

06:59.564 --> 07:01.440
Wow, that is really too easy.

07:02.066 --> 07:05.528
Okay. Everyone chill, I'm kidding.
There are no mystical creatures.

07:05.571 --> 07:08.155
Okay, unless you think skunks
are mystical.

07:08.489 --> 07:10.241
Save your spray, dude.

07:10.284 --> 07:12.869
He was just explaining the rules,
he didn't mean any offense.

07:12.910 --> 07:16.539
Hey! What'd I just say about not doing
magic right now?

07:16.957 --> 07:18.709
I wasn't doing magic!
I was just...

07:20.460 --> 07:23.672
talking to a skunk?

07:24.131 --> 07:25.965
Put a sock in it, skunk whisperer.

07:29.552 --> 07:33.848
I know, I know, that is so uncool, bro.
We'll talk later, okay?

07:34.725 --> 07:37.352
Hmm. What's up with emo-Joe over there?

07:37.393 --> 07:39.395
Maybe you should try talking to him
and find out.

07:39.897 --> 07:44.651
Yeah! Good idea! Get out there, mingle,
shake hands, kiss babies.

07:44.902 --> 07:48.280
After all, these are our people.

07:51.116 --> 07:52.116
Hey!

07:53.410 --> 07:54.453
I'm Nory.

07:55.244 --> 07:56.662
Nory Boxwood Horace.

07:58.039 --> 08:00.876
Very cool backpack, by the way.
Where did you get...

08:03.837 --> 08:07.174
- Our people are not big talkers.
- Solid effort though.

08:22.063 --> 08:24.107
You know what's worse
than this spooky forest?

08:24.900 --> 08:25.900
Nothing?

08:26.318 --> 08:29.488
That old guy wearing cargo shorts
over long johns.

08:41.999 --> 08:45.544
Awesome.
A creepy nightmare hole.

08:46.421 --> 08:51.093
Excuse me, sir, are we lost?

08:51.133 --> 08:55.013
Well, how would I know?
I'm just an old guy in wack threads.

08:57.516 --> 09:00.894
Now. Follow me, if you dare.

09:08.359 --> 09:09.485
Whoa!

09:14.282 --> 09:17.619
Nory? I could use one of those pep-talks
where you...

09:17.952 --> 09:22.374
tell me I'm a flame-throwing rock star,
because this is a lot.

09:23.874 --> 09:28.129
You are a flame-throwing rock star.
And this is a lot.

09:28.922 --> 09:31.173
But we got this.

10:24.644 --> 10:28.023
Eh. Don't even bother.
Those don't work here.

10:28.565 --> 10:29.650
Aw...

10:38.575 --> 10:41.119
These other fire kids are really good.

10:41.702 --> 10:45.039
Not better than you!
Reina, we're here!

10:52.047 --> 10:56.426
Students.
Students! Students!

10:58.302 --> 11:00.806
Welcome to orientation.

11:01.306 --> 11:05.352
I am Ms. Knightslinger,
the headmaster of Sage Academy.

11:06.143 --> 11:07.645
You are here at Sage

11:07.687 --> 11:12.234
because you display some measure
of innate magical talent.

11:12.484 --> 11:14.570
All of you will need guidance

11:14.610 --> 11:18.657
and instruction to develop
your magic correctly.

11:19.199 --> 11:22.578
The right way. The only way,

11:23.287 --> 11:24.870
the Sage way.

11:26.248 --> 11:30.210
Yes, it is all very exciting, I suppose.
Now!

11:31.836 --> 11:38.217
Sage has five distinct schools,
based on the five types of talent.

11:38.719 --> 11:42.472
Fuzzies, who communicate
with the animal kingdom.

11:42.763 --> 11:47.226
Flickers, who can make an object come
to them with the flick of a hand.

11:47.936 --> 11:51.355
Flares, who can harness the power of fire.

11:51.981 --> 11:55.484
Flyers, who, well, fly.

11:55.527 --> 12:00.824
And Fluxers, who have the power
to transform into any animal at will.

12:00.865 --> 12:02.241
Yes! This girl right here!

12:02.575 --> 12:05.077
Fluxing butt and taking numbers!

12:07.413 --> 12:08.372
Are we done?

12:11.167 --> 12:15.172
Sorry. I'm a Fluxer. But IÂ´m done now.
Not done being a Fluxer,

12:15.213 --> 12:17.215
but done talking.
Reina, tell me to be quiet.

12:17.257 --> 12:18.550
- Nory, be quiet.
- Okie-doke.

12:20.301 --> 12:22.220
As I was saying,

12:22.262 --> 12:25.349
you have a magical talent,
and that got you in the door.

12:25.389 --> 12:28.018
And by now, you're probably very clear
what that talent is,

12:28.060 --> 12:30.145
and which school you are in.

12:30.186 --> 12:31.520
- Fluxer!
- Nory!

12:31.562 --> 12:32.773
- Flare!
- Nory.

12:33.023 --> 12:34.733
Nory! Be quiet! Okie-doke.

12:35.316 --> 12:37.360
Moving on.

12:37.860 --> 12:42.448
We require all new students
to take a placement test,

12:42.865 --> 12:46.744
to see if you qualify
for our honors level classes.

13:02.009 --> 13:05.931
The Sage way
to evaluate Flare aptitude is thus,

13:06.264 --> 13:09.725
be able to light a candle
from six feet away.

13:10.643 --> 13:11.852
That's it?

13:11.894 --> 13:15.273
I can make a basketball out of fire,
and dunk it through a hoop,

13:15.566 --> 13:17.066
also made out of fire.

13:17.109 --> 13:21.863
You are not here to show off.
You are here to learn the Sage way.

13:22.114 --> 13:23.114
Now do it.

13:32.249 --> 13:34.167
Please collect your card
and wait in the quad.

13:43.093 --> 13:44.094
Hmm.

14:02.486 --> 14:03.487
Uh...

14:04.739 --> 14:05.948
Hey-o.

14:05.990 --> 14:09.577
Mister Elliot Cohen?
Please don't waste our time.

14:09.619 --> 14:11.330
- Light the candle.
- Okay.

14:35.144 --> 14:37.188
First lost cause of the day.

14:58.292 --> 15:00.628
- Was that okay?
- Very good, Reina.

15:01.296 --> 15:03.632
Please get your card
and wait in the quad.

15:08.135 --> 15:11.347
The Sage way
to evaluate Fuzzies is thus,

15:11.639 --> 15:13.475
you will ask this dog a series
of questions

15:13.517 --> 15:16.686
to which only we have the answer.
Proceed.

15:17.687 --> 15:20.523
Hey, bro. What's your name?

15:21.066 --> 15:22.191
- Banjo.
- Banjo.

15:22.234 --> 15:24.027
- Banjo.
- Hey, Banjo.

15:25.195 --> 15:26.738
- He's from Cleveland.
- Cleveland.

15:27.739 --> 15:32.494
His favorite food is chicken a la king,
but he also really needs to go walkies.

15:37.374 --> 15:40.668
The Sage way
to evaluate Flickers is thus,

15:41.168 --> 15:44.422
make the vase come to you
from six feet away.

15:47.968 --> 15:49.176
Ms. Paloma?

15:50.970 --> 15:52.471
- Pepper!
- What?

15:53.098 --> 15:54.349
Vase. You. Now.

15:58.394 --> 15:59.353
Yeah, okay.

16:18.123 --> 16:21.167
- We good?
- Quite.

16:25.880 --> 16:29.300
The Sage way to evaluate Fliers is thus,

16:30.259 --> 16:34.056
fly three feet off the ground,
stay in the air for 30 seconds,

16:34.096 --> 16:35.431
and land safely.

16:48.861 --> 16:50.780
Andres, we're waiting.

16:54.533 --> 16:55.451
Andres!

17:02.626 --> 17:05.252
Well, I don't need to tell you
that is more than three feet.

17:05.294 --> 17:08.381
Thank you, Andres.
You can come down now.

17:10.675 --> 17:13.095
You can't? Wonderful!

17:13.887 --> 17:15.012
Skriff!

17:25.732 --> 17:28.652
The Sage way
of evaluating Fluxers is thus,

17:29.151 --> 17:33.447
flux into this grey tabby kitten,
hold the form for six seconds,

17:33.490 --> 17:36.451
and then flux back to your human form.

17:40.289 --> 17:44.459
One, two, three,

17:45.209 --> 17:48.504
four, five, six.

18:09.693 --> 18:12.279
- Nory.
- Yo.

18:12.821 --> 18:14.990
Please flux into this kitten for us.

18:15.032 --> 18:16.617
- Just the kitten?
- Yes!

18:17.117 --> 18:19.536
- So, that kitten.
- Nory.

18:19.911 --> 18:25.249
Okay. One kitten,
of the grey tabby variety.

18:25.958 --> 18:28.210
Coming up. Made to order.

18:29.295 --> 18:30.671
Hot and fresh.

18:55.738 --> 18:58.074
One, two...

19:12.171 --> 19:13.381
Oh.

19:21.848 --> 19:24.933
Ta-da! Pretty cool, right?

19:24.935 --> 19:28.062
Was there some llama in there?
It felt like a little bit of llama.

19:28.105 --> 19:30.941
That was very unique.

19:41.076 --> 19:42.995
Attention, everyone!

20:02.138 --> 20:08.645
It is always a joy to meet the new class,
and today is no exception.

20:09.646 --> 20:12.441
Well, perhaps a there were
a few exceptions.

20:12.482 --> 20:15.610
Regardless, everyone,
please take a look at your cards,

20:15.651 --> 20:18.821
and find out where
you have been placed!

20:40.801 --> 20:44.180
- Nory, look!
- Awesome! Congrats.

20:44.973 --> 20:46.390
What does yours say?

20:54.148 --> 20:57.569
- That's not anything.
- Maybe it's broken.

20:57.610 --> 20:59.571
- Ask somebody.
- All right, students!

20:59.612 --> 21:03.282
Off to the dining hall
to get your uniforms!

21:12.042 --> 21:14.628
No, Nory. You go that way.

21:19.299 --> 21:20.509
Come along, Reina.

21:22.636 --> 21:23.595
You gonna be okay?

21:24.263 --> 21:27.182
Of course I am.
Now go get 'em, rock star.

21:36.942 --> 21:38.694
What's a UDM?

22:09.665 --> 22:10.792
Uh, hello?

22:13.878 --> 22:15.087
Anyone?

22:15.672 --> 22:16.548
Who are you?

22:17.924 --> 22:18.800
Nory.

22:20.384 --> 22:22.596
I was right behind you on the walk
this morning.

22:24.431 --> 22:26.141
I looked kinda like this?

22:30.186 --> 22:33.022
Ah! Yes, you are, yes, you were,
and yes, you did.

22:33.523 --> 22:36.776
Okay, come on down.
And shut the door behind you.

22:47.246 --> 22:48.372
The door, kid.

23:06.347 --> 23:08.349
- What's this?
- It's your uniform.

23:11.561 --> 23:14.021
Where's the cool jacket and hoodie
all the other kids get?

23:14.397 --> 23:19.235
Oh, uh, you get to wear your own
cool jacket and, or hoodie.

23:19.694 --> 23:21.070
Isn't that exciting...

23:21.571 --> 23:24.157
- in theory?
- We don't get a special color?

23:24.490 --> 23:30.204
No. But you do get a desk.
So sit down. Pop a squat.

23:30.247 --> 23:31.414
Take a seat.

23:31.455 --> 23:35.084
I am Mr. Skriff,
and I am in charge of the UDM.

23:36.836 --> 23:39.173
What is this place?
Are you sure IÂ´m supposed to be here?

23:39.756 --> 23:42.384
Did you tank your placement exam
like us?

23:42.634 --> 23:47.514
No! I blew their minds, with magic
they could barely understand.

23:48.182 --> 23:51.518
In other words, you tanked
your placement exam. Like them.

23:52.102 --> 23:54.730
He made smoke instead of fire.

23:55.189 --> 23:58.192
She pushed the vase away
instead of toward her.

23:58.858 --> 24:01.944
He could go up,
but he couldn't come down.

24:01.987 --> 24:04.948
And you couldn't be just a kitten.

24:05.324 --> 24:08.785
So, butt. Seat. Now.

24:08.826 --> 24:12.122
I'm still pretty sure I'm not supposed
to be here.

24:12.163 --> 24:16.960
Oh, and I'm deffo sure that you are.
Why? Because you're wonky.

24:17.001 --> 24:20.838
And weird and your magic is defective.
Yup, that's why you're all here,

24:20.881 --> 24:24.843
wonky, weird, defective magic.
We don't always know why it happens.

24:24.884 --> 24:28.596
We don't really care why it happens,
but when it does, you come to me.

24:28.638 --> 24:32.141
So, welcome to the School
of Upside-Down Magic.

24:32.643 --> 24:34.644
So, UDM means...

24:34.685 --> 24:39.106
"Upside-down magic."
Congratulations, you are a genius.

24:39.691 --> 24:43.694
Or rather, not a genius,
at least where magic is concerned.

24:47.115 --> 24:51.118
But buck up, kiddo! With a little luck,
we'll get that fixed.

24:51.161 --> 24:52.663
- Really?
- No, probably not.

24:52.703 --> 24:54.455
I mean maybe, but not usually.

24:54.498 --> 24:56.250
Possibly, I wouldn't count on it.

24:56.290 --> 24:58.460
But we, like get to do magic though,
right?

25:00.128 --> 25:01.129
Right?

25:02.422 --> 25:04.423
Uh, no. No, we do not.

25:04.465 --> 25:07.468
We study, like, school stuff here.
Okay?

25:07.719 --> 25:11.557
Math and things. Assignments.

25:12.223 --> 25:13.391
Magic assignments?

25:13.432 --> 25:16.686
Are you even listening?
No! No magic!

25:17.186 --> 25:21.649
It's my job to help keep you productive,
busy, engaged.

25:21.900 --> 25:23.192
It's also my job

25:23.234 --> 25:26.279
to be the groundskeeper
and handle general maintenance issues

25:26.320 --> 25:28.115
at this fine institution.

25:28.156 --> 25:31.993
- So, wait. Are you a teacher or what?
- Am I a teacher?

25:32.035 --> 25:34.454
What I am is very busy, okay?

25:34.496 --> 25:37.166
So, please, do not pester me
with abstract questions.

25:37.207 --> 25:41.170
Well, here's a clear, direct one then,
why can't we study magic here?

25:41.211 --> 25:42.587
Because your magic

25:43.005 --> 25:44.548
is wrong.

25:44.923 --> 25:47.300
But, that's why we're here.
To learn how to do it right.

25:47.675 --> 25:51.471
You are never going to learn
how to do it right.

25:52.138 --> 25:56.392
Upside-down magic
will never be proper magic.

25:56.727 --> 26:00.439
In the eyes of Sage,
you are unteachable.

26:01.606 --> 26:03.442
So, what happens now?

26:04.108 --> 26:06.819
You sit here. And you wait.

26:07.112 --> 26:10.407
- For what?
- For your magic to disappear.

26:11.909 --> 26:14.036
Magic is like a muscle.

26:14.411 --> 26:17.038
If you don't use it,
it will wither away,

26:17.079 --> 26:18.581
and eventually cease to work.

26:19.458 --> 26:22.127
And then, we send you
back into the world,

26:22.169 --> 26:24.296
where you can pursue a life as...

26:24.797 --> 26:28.717
an accountant, or a dog groomer,

26:28.967 --> 26:30.677
or whatever it is people do.

26:31.260 --> 26:34.181
What possible reason
could you have for taking

26:34.222 --> 26:38.143
a bunch of perfectly good magic kids
and letting them go bad like,

26:38.935 --> 26:41.062
a bunch of bananas
you forgot in a drawer?

26:41.480 --> 26:43.941
To protect humanity.

26:48.694 --> 26:52.782
For a while, Sage treated UDMs
like any other students.

26:52.825 --> 26:58.705
Until 1939, and a student named

26:59.038 --> 27:01.333
Reginald Roberts.

27:04.127 --> 27:06.170
Reginald was a Flare.

27:08.507 --> 27:11.802
But he could only express his flame

27:11.844 --> 27:15.264
through his basement furnace.

27:19.268 --> 27:22.938
And yes, it was very funny to all.
But little did we know

27:23.188 --> 27:28.360
that Reginald's upside-down magic
made him the perfect host for...

27:29.278 --> 27:30.487
Shadow magic.

27:34.240 --> 27:37.118
The dark side to our magic.

27:37.911 --> 27:43.292
Magic that exists solely to cause chaos
and anarchy.

27:44.876 --> 27:49.338
We were able to overcome the beast
that Reginald had become,

27:49.964 --> 27:51.299
but just barely.

28:03.394 --> 28:06.397
Shadow magic cannot work
without a human host.

28:06.940 --> 28:10.277
And UDMs are its sole target.

28:10.861 --> 28:13.947
Like, how a crack in a piece of fruit

28:14.323 --> 28:16.909
allows the rot to seep in.

28:17.992 --> 28:22.955
That's you.
You are that cracked fruit.

28:23.499 --> 28:26.250
So. You will stay down here.

28:26.501 --> 28:31.214
You will not practice magic.
And your magic will die.

28:35.635 --> 28:38.971
But better it than all of us.

28:41.224 --> 28:43.519
I suspect there are no further questions.

28:45.561 --> 28:47.563
Thank you. Skriff. Skriff!

28:52.109 --> 28:53.569
As you were.

28:59.617 --> 29:02.287
Okay. Well then,

29:02.788 --> 29:05.874
let's begin with my inaugural lecture,

29:06.290 --> 29:09.086
"How to deal with having all
of your dreams crushed

29:09.127 --> 29:12.463
"by smushing your feelings into a ball
deep inside your stomach."

29:12.506 --> 29:14.800
Now. Write this down.

29:15.675 --> 29:19.554
Step one, take your feelings
and smush them real good

29:19.596 --> 29:22.223
into a tiny ball
deep inside your stomach.

29:22.598 --> 29:23.599
"Step one...

29:25.102 --> 29:28.272
"do everything I can
to get my magic right-side up,

29:29.147 --> 29:31.357
"and become a real Fluxer."

29:41.451 --> 29:44.538
Welcome to Honors Flare class.

29:45.288 --> 29:49.000
It's called "Honors"
because it is an honor to be here.

29:49.292 --> 29:51.836
And, if any of you do not live up
to that honor,

29:51.878 --> 29:53.838
you will be demoted immediately.

29:54.756 --> 29:57.259
Now, small piece of business
before we get started.

29:57.968 --> 30:02.473
In a few weeks, Sage will hold
our Annual FoundersÂ´ Day,

30:03.182 --> 30:06.351
a celebration of our distinguished alumni.

30:06.602 --> 30:11.398
As part of the festivities,
there will be a student presentation.

30:11.856 --> 30:15.693
Each school will select its top two
first-year students.

30:16.653 --> 30:20.990
Those students will compete
in a head to head battle we like to call

30:21.616 --> 30:23.076
the Sage Match.

30:24.536 --> 30:28.999
The winner from each school
gets to perform for the alumni,

30:29.040 --> 30:31.793
and all of Sage,
in the FoundersÂ´ Day presentation.

30:32.752 --> 30:35.004
Now. On to our studies.

30:35.588 --> 30:40.092
Flaring is more than making fire.

30:40.551 --> 30:45.307
Flaring is the modulated application
of heat.

30:46.724 --> 30:47.809
Reina!

30:49.644 --> 30:52.480
You had a rather good evaluation,
didn't you?

30:55.233 --> 30:57.568
Come down. You see, Reina,

30:58.820 --> 31:02.281
even the most basic Flare
can light a candle.

31:02.532 --> 31:04.492
But popcorn...

31:12.584 --> 31:17.005
See, that requires just the right touch.

31:20.174 --> 31:21.634
Let's see if you have it.

31:43.448 --> 31:46.160
I am a flame-throwing rock star.

32:15.605 --> 32:18.901
Reina, how do you think you did?

32:21.319 --> 32:22.278
Terribly.

32:24.906 --> 32:26.073
I'm sorry, Professor.

32:27.910 --> 32:29.202
First day jitters.

32:30.119 --> 32:33.748
First day jitters? Okay. Sure.

32:35.250 --> 32:37.586
Do you know how many
first days you get?

32:38.796 --> 32:40.881
One. Sit.

32:42.173 --> 32:44.300
Now. Next victim.

32:45.259 --> 32:48.055
Let's see if you can do better
than "terribly."

33:29.054 --> 33:30.305
Not that I care,

33:30.346 --> 33:33.307
but will we be having like,
a class today?

33:33.683 --> 33:36.894
Class? You kids would rather sit
in a classroom instead of getting out

33:36.936 --> 33:38.187
for a big surprise?

33:39.230 --> 33:40.566
What kind of surprise?

33:53.077 --> 33:54.954
- Are those...
- Surprise!

34:09.427 --> 34:10.429
Woo-hoo!

34:21.940 --> 34:25.152
- Well, that looked painful.
- Extremely.

34:27.152 --> 34:30.072
So, what did I do wrong?
How do you fly that thing?

34:30.114 --> 34:32.241
Um, you don't. You sweep with it.

34:32.951 --> 34:34.911
It's not a flying broom,
it's a broom broom.

34:35.411 --> 34:36.913
- For sweeping.
- I'm sorry?

34:36.954 --> 34:41.000
What exactly was the surprise
part of this "surprise"?

34:41.460 --> 34:44.463
I mean, Nory was surprised
when she fell on her butt.

34:45.922 --> 34:47.380
- Up high.
- No.

34:48.717 --> 34:52.429
It's a surprise because
they're exciting brand-new brooms!

34:52.471 --> 34:54.097
Look at that high-quality straw.

34:54.139 --> 34:56.141
You think that's not expensive?
And, hey!

34:56.181 --> 34:58.643
If it doesn't fly,
it can still take you places.

34:58.684 --> 35:00.938
Like, anywhere you see trash,

35:01.605 --> 35:05.943
you can go there, now,
and you can sweep that trash.

35:11.030 --> 35:14.242
You see, kids,
fluxing is all in the preparation!

35:14.742 --> 35:18.788
If you don't study an animal,
how can you expect to change into one?

35:18.831 --> 35:21.625
So for your evaluation,
we asked you to flux

35:21.666 --> 35:23.960
into a grey tabby kitten.

35:24.001 --> 35:26.212
But now, we have to go deeper.

35:26.713 --> 35:28.798
And you have to learn how
to flux into

35:28.840 --> 35:30.842
this exact kitten.

35:31.677 --> 35:34.512
Once you've mastered that,
then and only then

35:34.554 --> 35:36.139
can you advance to chickens.

35:36.389 --> 35:39.143
And one day, dare to dream, goats.

35:39.476 --> 35:42.436
Yes, indeed, goats!

35:42.478 --> 35:45.815
Nature's jesters! What joy! Mm.

35:47.108 --> 35:51.028
And remember, IÂ´m going to give two of you
the opportunity to compete

35:51.280 --> 35:54.950
in the Sage Match for a spot
in the FoundersÂ´ Day presentation.

35:56.827 --> 35:59.580
Take a minute
with Miss Ollie Floofenstein.

36:00.539 --> 36:04.084
Make note of the many shapes
that make her, her.

36:05.251 --> 36:07.503
From the triangles of her ears

36:07.963 --> 36:10.466
to the ovals on the pads of her paws.

36:10.923 --> 36:11.925
Focus on them.

36:12.259 --> 36:17.264
Take a mental picture and store it
deep in your consciousness.

36:17.681 --> 36:18.807
Hmm?

36:20.349 --> 36:24.688
I'm never gonna get any better
until I can get some feline face-time!

36:33.614 --> 36:37.492
Nory, what are you doing here?
UDMs aren't supposed to...

36:37.534 --> 36:41.497
Don't mind me, just doing my part
to keep this campus spic and span!

36:41.538 --> 36:43.664
By sweeping the lawn?

36:43.706 --> 36:46.167
What can I say,
IÂ´m very devoted to my work.

36:47.460 --> 36:49.045
Oh, hello!

36:49.838 --> 36:52.216
Say, would you mind
if I gave her a little snug?

36:53.550 --> 36:55.385
- Absolutely no...
- Great!

36:56.260 --> 36:59.389
Grey. Soft. Warm.

37:00.306 --> 37:01.849
Breath smells like tuna...

37:08.148 --> 37:09.691
Skriff! Skriff!

37:10.317 --> 37:12.652
Oh, jeez! Nory!

37:12.693 --> 37:16.030
- Skriff, if Knightslinger sees this...
- No, no, no, she won't.

37:16.072 --> 37:18.115
She won't. Just give me a minute. Okay?

37:18.699 --> 37:21.661
Hey, Nory. Breathe.

37:21.702 --> 37:25.039
You're safe. Okay? Just breathe.

37:25.498 --> 37:28.376
- You're okay.
- Look away, class.

37:28.876 --> 37:30.962
Think happy thoughts.
Think about goats.

37:37.177 --> 37:39.054
You're making me miss lunch?

37:41.222 --> 37:43.182
Here, dig in.

37:49.356 --> 37:51.775
Mealy. What a garbage day.

37:52.025 --> 37:55.362
Okay. You can hit the dining hall
in a few. But first,

37:55.403 --> 37:58.907
you and I need to have a little talk.
You know you can't do that again.

37:59.657 --> 38:04.954
- I know. But the thing is I wanna...
- Oh, my bad. Go ahead then.

38:05.873 --> 38:07.124
Except don't!

38:07.708 --> 38:11.670
Nory, we're trying to protect you.
You know that, right?

38:13.672 --> 38:16.048
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

38:17.759 --> 38:21.429
- Okay. Go chow down.
- Thanks!

38:35.693 --> 38:36.737
Hey!

38:53.711 --> 38:54.713
Nory!

38:56.672 --> 38:59.967
Hey! I'm sorry, you want some mustard
with that?

39:00.219 --> 39:02.762
Yeah, that sounds good,
and a bag of chips.

39:03.012 --> 39:04.806
And get something nice for yourself.

39:06.099 --> 39:07.976
That's awesome.

39:08.393 --> 39:12.481
Hey, Pepper, pass the salt. Get it?

39:12.773 --> 39:15.818
- Never heard that one before.
- Hey, Nory?

39:19.237 --> 39:20.154
Yeah?

39:21.447 --> 39:24.242
I just gotta tell you,
that thing you turned into?

39:24.576 --> 39:26.077
That was like a cat,

39:26.119 --> 39:29.081
- and a bird, and an elephant, and...
- Wait! Hold up.

39:29.121 --> 39:29.998
You talk?

39:30.998 --> 39:32.667
When I have something to say, yeah.

39:33.501 --> 39:34.503
Respect.

39:36.045 --> 39:39.924
Anyway, Nory.
It was real cool. I dug it.

39:42.219 --> 39:43.345
Thanks, Andres.

39:44.221 --> 39:46.639
It's nice to get a little support.

39:46.681 --> 39:48.766
But that's the last
you're gonna see of...

39:49.601 --> 39:52.729
whatever I was.
I'm gonna be the perfect Fluxer for them.

39:52.771 --> 39:53.981
- I know it.
- How?

39:54.313 --> 39:57.150
They're not gonna let you near
that class or that kitten.

40:00.237 --> 40:03.907
"From the triangles of her ears
to the ovals on the pads of her paws."

40:04.240 --> 40:06.826
Whoa! These are great.
I didn't know you could draw.

40:08.996 --> 40:10.873
There's a lot
you don't know about me, Andres.

40:12.623 --> 40:16.461
No, actually, that's it. I can draw.
You know pretty much everything else.

40:17.170 --> 40:19.380
Anyway, I figured I can work off of this.

40:19.630 --> 40:21.215
You think you can draw me shooting fire

40:21.257 --> 40:22.675
- like a real Flare?
- Totally!

40:23.010 --> 40:24.678
- Or me landing?
- Sure!

40:25.094 --> 40:27.138
- Do not draw me.
- Okie-doke.

40:37.940 --> 40:41.569
- So, I decided to see...
- Hey. I think you have a fan.

40:43.030 --> 40:44.031
Reina!

40:45.532 --> 40:49.495
- Reina. We sit at the Flare table.
- But she's my best...

40:49.536 --> 40:52.706
She is your best opportunity
to lose focus,

40:52.748 --> 40:55.083
and fall even further behind.

41:07.762 --> 41:08.764
That's weird.

41:10.306 --> 41:13.017
- She didn't come over.
- 'Cause we're the loser table.

41:15.269 --> 41:17.230
Hey! Who threw that at me?

41:17.856 --> 41:20.234
Yeah, well, I got a plan.

41:21.193 --> 41:24.153
You know the Sage Match?
I'm going.

41:24.822 --> 41:26.782
Why? They're not
going to let you compete.

41:26.824 --> 41:30.827
I know. But, I'm gonna show them
that I can flux the right way.

41:31.286 --> 41:34.581
Proving that us UDMs can be taught
to do magic right!

41:35.998 --> 41:38.459
You know what?
Nory, I think you can do it.

41:39.460 --> 41:43.214
I know you can.

41:45.134 --> 41:47.760
- Thanks, Andres.
- Er, disgusting.

41:48.052 --> 41:51.931
Nory can have my sandwich,
because I have lost my appetite.

41:52.224 --> 41:53.642
- Up high?
- Pass.

41:53.684 --> 41:54.685
Come on!

43:02.970 --> 43:04.011
It's perfect.

43:05.472 --> 43:08.057
Excellent work. Have a seat.

43:09.392 --> 43:10.935
Now, the question is...

43:11.979 --> 43:14.314
who's gonna be the one
to take him on?

43:16.316 --> 43:19.278
Reina. Is it you?

43:52.560 --> 43:53.562
Okay.

43:55.272 --> 43:58.525
All right. This is...

44:11.330 --> 44:12.581
...not perfect.

44:13.289 --> 44:17.418
It's close,
but not as good as Phillip's.

44:18.921 --> 44:20.089
And honestly, Reina,

44:20.129 --> 44:21.923
I thought you were better
than second best.

44:23.216 --> 44:24.593
I guess, I was wrong.

44:37.064 --> 44:40.109
- Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't see you.
- I saw you...

44:41.859 --> 44:42.944
in class.

44:44.530 --> 44:48.242
- Nice work.
- Yeah. Nice work being second best.

44:48.575 --> 44:50.202
No. Argon lacks vision.

44:50.243 --> 44:52.328
I can tell you have more power
in your little finger

44:52.370 --> 44:53.872
than Phillip has in his whole dumb body.

44:56.374 --> 44:58.668
- Thank you...
- Chandra.

44:59.586 --> 45:02.964
And, hey, if you ever want to learn
how to harness all that power...

45:04.173 --> 45:05.925
I might have something that can help.

45:23.151 --> 45:26.362
Excuse me, ma'am, you're blocking
important sweeping business.

45:26.405 --> 45:28.906
- Nory!
- Hey, Reina!

45:29.408 --> 45:30.784
I've missed you.

45:35.580 --> 45:38.791
- What are you doing?
- This? It's...

45:39.459 --> 45:41.502
a top-secret training exercise.

45:42.129 --> 45:44.089
Kind of a UDMÂ´s only kinda jam.

45:44.381 --> 45:46.716
We're learning stuff
that would blow your mind.

45:48.635 --> 45:52.222
I saw you with those other kids
at the dining hall the other day.

45:53.557 --> 45:55.309
It looks like you're all
really getting along.

45:56.477 --> 45:58.645
Yeah! Totally! It's going great!

46:00.064 --> 46:02.149
But enough about me,
how are you doing?

46:02.191 --> 46:05.194
Are you totally acing your classes?
Do you have a million cool friends?

46:05.234 --> 46:06.861
Does everyone know you're the coolest?

46:07.111 --> 46:08.030
I, um.

46:11.492 --> 46:12.367
I'm great.

46:13.993 --> 46:18.874
Everything you said. A million friends.
Acing my classes.

46:19.332 --> 46:22.502
Sage is everything I wanted it to be.

46:22.877 --> 46:24.921
I knew you'd set this place on fire.
Metaphorically.

46:26.423 --> 46:28.841
It sounds like you're doing amazing, too.

46:34.430 --> 46:36.307
- Well, I have to get back.
- Well, I have to get back.

46:38.977 --> 46:42.606
- See you around?
- Yeah. See you.

48:39.472 --> 48:40.473
Soon enough.

48:49.899 --> 48:51.151
One second.

48:51.401 --> 48:52.653
- Two.
- Come on, Nory.

48:52.693 --> 48:53.778
Three...

49:00.202 --> 49:01.537
Hey!

49:01.577 --> 49:03.538
What the heck is going on in there?

49:07.917 --> 49:09.752
- Subtle.
- Never mind.

49:09.794 --> 49:14.758
They don't pay me enough to care.
Also, I just generally don't care.

49:18.595 --> 49:22.015
- Did I hear "Four seconds"?
- No and you never will.

49:22.975 --> 49:25.978
- Hey, she might.
- She won't.

49:26.019 --> 49:29.647
No! Come on, you guys!

49:29.689 --> 49:32.525
I used to not be able
to hold my cat form at all!

49:32.568 --> 49:34.861
And now IÂ´ve got it
for three and a half seconds!

49:34.903 --> 49:37.740
That's huge!
And I did that on my own!

49:40.408 --> 49:41.617
I'm gonna get there!

49:42.368 --> 49:43.370
I know it.

49:44.370 --> 49:48.876
I promise to you now.
I'm gonna crash the Sage Match,

49:49.584 --> 49:52.963
and prove to the entire faculty
that we can be taught!

49:53.296 --> 49:57.341
We can do things the right-side-up way!
The Sage way!

50:19.698 --> 50:23.368
- Guys, tonight, I know it.
- Oh! Maybe we should

50:23.410 --> 50:27.122
- get you some catnip.
- I never thought of catnip.

50:29.792 --> 50:31.877
She's doing great without me.

51:06.577 --> 51:09.872
"Manifesting your untapped power."

52:18.316 --> 52:20.526
- Good luck in there.
- Thanks.

52:20.568 --> 52:21.652
You're gonna need it.

52:27.785 --> 52:30.037
And he huffed, and he puffed,

52:30.620 --> 52:33.664
but the wolf couldn't blow
the brick house down.

52:34.290 --> 52:36.042
What happened to him after that?

52:36.084 --> 52:39.295
Well, that is inconclusive.

52:39.338 --> 52:41.256
The end.

52:44.676 --> 52:50.140
Mm. Riveting stuff, Elliot. Okay, Nory.
You're next.

52:52.350 --> 52:53.559
Nory!

52:54.812 --> 52:56.271
Let's go!

53:01.693 --> 53:03.069
Where's Nory?

53:03.111 --> 53:06.155
- Nory who?
- Yeah, which one of us is she?

53:06.406 --> 53:07.490
Never heard of her.

53:08.700 --> 53:10.618
She hasn't been here the whole time,
has she?

53:12.162 --> 53:15.207
Hey! Where is she?

53:18.502 --> 53:21.672
Look, Nory's doing it for us, okay?
She wants to prove to the whole school

53:21.713 --> 53:23.423
that we can learn real magic.

53:24.758 --> 53:26.635
Prove it how?

53:35.017 --> 53:38.438
- She's going to crash the Sage Match.
- Oh. Great.

53:38.939 --> 53:42.317
Okay, everyone, stay here.

53:56.914 --> 54:00.376
Let the Sage Match begin!

54:07.593 --> 54:11.305
Flares! Phillip, Reina, you're up!

54:21.147 --> 54:22.106
Begin.

54:32.075 --> 54:33.743
- Done!
- What?

54:34.952 --> 54:36.120
Come forward.

54:58.894 --> 55:03.189
- She did it!
- Reina, you will represent the Flares!

55:08.694 --> 55:12.990
- Next! Let us bring up the Flyers.
- Stop the presses!

55:13.742 --> 55:16.787
Oh, Nory, hooray.
My day is complete.

55:16.828 --> 55:18.914
- You! Get out!
- No.

55:20.749 --> 55:24.252
I have been practicing,
and I know I can do this.

55:24.752 --> 55:27.506
I can follow the Sage way.
I can be the exact kitten

55:27.548 --> 55:29.174
you want for the exact amount of time.

55:30.591 --> 55:32.845
I know you think
I have zero potential, but...

55:33.678 --> 55:36.097
I'm here to tell you
that you are wrong.

55:36.472 --> 55:38.891
All want is for you
to give me a chance.

55:40.394 --> 55:44.522
But, if you say no,
I will respect that.

55:44.897 --> 55:46.899
- No.
- I lied!

56:05.169 --> 56:07.254
One. Two.

56:07.296 --> 56:08.338
- Nory!
- Nory!

56:08.379 --> 56:09.673
- Nory!
- Nory!

56:09.714 --> 56:10.716
Three.

56:11.008 --> 56:12.216
- Nory!
- Nory!

56:12.468 --> 56:14.219
Four...

56:35.490 --> 56:37.575
Somebody do something!

56:38.410 --> 56:42.289
Sparkle fire ball. It's her favorite.
Maybe it'll help!

56:57.930 --> 56:58.972
What's happening?

57:00.098 --> 57:01.225
What is this?

57:09.399 --> 57:10.651
Nory.

57:11.484 --> 57:14.530
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
I don't know what happened.

57:14.905 --> 57:16.406
I don't know what that was.

57:16.448 --> 57:19.618
- I really didn't mean to...
- Reina, I'm okay. It's okay.

57:20.368 --> 57:21.370
Are you sure you're okay?

57:22.703 --> 57:23.872
Skriff.

57:23.914 --> 57:28.001
How many times do we have to tell you
to keep your charges in the bunker

57:28.042 --> 57:29.419
where they belong!

57:30.129 --> 57:33.507
The only reason we're not expelling you
this instant

57:33.548 --> 57:36.342
is because we need to keep you here
to protect the world

57:36.385 --> 57:37.970
from your wonky magic!

57:38.010 --> 57:41.264
Hey, with all due respect,
I think she gets it.

57:42.015 --> 57:46.060
As for you, Skriff.
If any of the UDMs

57:46.102 --> 57:49.522
are caught practicing magic again,
you will be terminated!

57:51.149 --> 57:53.484
- I'll lose my job?
- If you're lucky.

57:53.526 --> 57:56.571
And don't even think
about attending FoundersÂ´ Day!

57:56.613 --> 57:58.741
The UDMs are banned!

58:05.455 --> 58:06.497
Come on.

58:17.593 --> 58:20.053
Guys. Guys, say something.

58:20.970 --> 58:23.514
Andres? Pepper?

58:25.475 --> 58:26.477
Elliot?

58:28.269 --> 58:30.563
Come on, fam,
what's with the silent treatment?

58:32.691 --> 58:34.068
Wow. Some friends!

58:34.109 --> 58:36.987
I'm practically smothered
from all of this kindness and support,

58:37.028 --> 58:40.531
- after the worst day of my entire life!
- You got our hopes up, Nory.

58:40.783 --> 58:41.784
Not mine.

58:44.118 --> 58:47.247
Okay, mine. But I hated feeling hopeful.

58:47.622 --> 58:50.833
You told us we wouldn't have
to hide in a bunker

58:50.876 --> 58:53.629
- until we just ran out of magic.
- But you were wrong.

58:53.921 --> 58:55.798
We're always gonna be upside down.

58:55.839 --> 58:58.967
Yeah. At least until we're just nothing.

58:59.801 --> 59:02.512
- Just people.
- Accountants. Dog groomers.

59:03.055 --> 59:05.015
That's why the silent treatment.

59:05.515 --> 59:07.059
Get used to it.

59:09.394 --> 59:11.312
I honestly thought
it was gonna work out.

59:11.354 --> 59:13.439
Because I always think things
are gonna work out.

59:14.941 --> 59:16.609
Now I know they won't and...

59:17.861 --> 59:18.862
IÂ´m sorry.

59:19.696 --> 59:22.031
- I'm sorry I let you down.
- Okay.

59:22.073 --> 59:23.908
Butts outta seats!

59:24.493 --> 59:28.205
Come on!
Butts minus seats equals you.

59:28.914 --> 59:31.499
- Math!
- Where are we going?

59:32.042 --> 59:34.336
On a date with destiny.

59:39.216 --> 59:43.220
Outside. We're just going outside.
It's nice out. Come on!

59:46.765 --> 59:49.685
Okay. So, Nory apologized to all of you,
right?

59:49.727 --> 59:52.062
But what exactly did she do wrong?

59:52.729 --> 59:55.189
Hmm? I'll tell ya.

59:56.566 --> 59:58.568
She dared to think she could be more

59:58.609 --> 01:00:01.530
than what Sage told her she was.
A UDM.

01:00:02.196 --> 01:00:03.948
A hard-luck case with broken magic.

01:00:04.240 --> 01:00:06.743
A useless anomaly
to be forced into the darkness,

01:00:06.785 --> 01:00:08.495
never to be thought of again.

01:00:08.537 --> 01:00:11.457
And I sat there at my desk,
and I let her apologize to you.

01:00:11.999 --> 01:00:15.627
When, like, really,
I should have been the one apologizing.

01:00:15.919 --> 01:00:18.422
- Why should you apologize?
- Yeah,

01:00:18.464 --> 01:00:20.424
- you're just doing your job.
- Sort of.

01:00:22.091 --> 01:00:23.176
My job...

01:00:24.135 --> 01:00:25.845
My job for years

01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:29.600
has been to watch class after class
of UDMs come here,

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:33.854
get their dreams squashed,
and leave here broken.

01:00:36.231 --> 01:00:39.026
And I have hated every second of it.

01:00:40.443 --> 01:00:42.528
- But you kept doing it.
- I did.

01:00:43.238 --> 01:00:46.575
Because Sage made me feel like
I had nothing to offer.

01:00:46.825 --> 01:00:49.620
But as long as I did what they said,
I could stay here.

01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:51.622
But I can't do that anymore.

01:00:54.792 --> 01:00:56.210
That ends today.

01:00:57.127 --> 01:01:00.506
And that ends today because of Nory.

01:01:00.964 --> 01:01:05.219
For the first time in
a lot of years, Nory, you...

01:01:05.968 --> 01:01:07.887
you made me a believer.

01:01:08.722 --> 01:01:11.475
You made me believe that UDMs

01:01:11.517 --> 01:01:14.352
could be more than what Sage
tells them. So much more.

01:01:14.394 --> 01:01:16.271
How? With my stupid magic?

01:01:16.522 --> 01:01:19.441
Dude. There is nothing stupid
or upside down

01:01:19.482 --> 01:01:21.193
- about your magic.
- But Sage...

01:01:21.234 --> 01:01:25.321
Exactly, Sage. Sage told you
your magic is upside down.

01:01:25.363 --> 01:01:27.073
But do you actually think that?

01:01:27.533 --> 01:01:31.745
Any of you. Nory,
when you first discovered your powers,

01:01:31.995 --> 01:01:35.833
were you like, "Oh, nuts, I can do magic,
but it's wrong."

01:01:37.167 --> 01:01:42.172
No! I thought, "I can do magic,
and that's cool as heck."

01:01:43.089 --> 01:01:45.341
And I still think that.
Even if it's wonky.

01:01:45.383 --> 01:01:47.635
Even if it's upside down.
Even if it doesn't fit in with...

01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:51.180
- "The Sage way."
- ...the Sage way.

01:01:53.100 --> 01:01:55.560
I'm never gonna be magic
the Sage way.

01:01:56.269 --> 01:01:59.856
Never ever.
None of us are. And you know what?

01:02:01.524 --> 01:02:03.860
I don't care.

01:02:04.694 --> 01:02:06.530
I can be magic my way.

01:02:06.571 --> 01:02:09.532
We all can!
We can all be magic our way.

01:02:09.575 --> 01:02:13.203
Yes! You guys all have amazing powers.

01:02:13.245 --> 01:02:16.915
You just have to learn how to harness them
and master them.

01:02:16.957 --> 01:02:19.626
Yeah? And who's gonna teach us that?

01:02:20.042 --> 01:02:24.381
Well, I don't really see anyone else here,
so, I guess...

01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:26.050
me?

01:02:27.843 --> 01:02:29.845
Sorry, um, you?

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:35.184
Yeah, I mean, you're great at raking

01:02:35.225 --> 01:02:37.519
and letting us chew gum in class...

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.854
But what can you teach us
about magic?

01:02:41.272 --> 01:02:43.901
You know what?
Valid concerns, all of those.

01:02:45.943 --> 01:02:46.986
Let me show you something.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.161
Calling all creatures

01:02:55.745 --> 01:02:58.624
Feathered, fluffy, furry, fuzzy

01:02:58.664 --> 01:03:02.126
They all wanna meet ya

01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:05.089
Now we're talking, chirping, squawking

01:03:05.129 --> 01:03:07.883
You see, I can teach y'all

01:03:08.258 --> 01:03:13.555
And now you all know why

01:03:16.057 --> 01:03:18.518
Wait, you're a Fuzzy?

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.939
Uh. Correction. I'm an upside-down Fuzzy.

01:03:22.772 --> 01:03:25.733
Check it out.
Hey, dude, get off my shoulder.

01:03:29.028 --> 01:03:32.323
Get off my shoulder

01:03:32.365 --> 01:03:37.662
Now it's time to fly

01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:43.084
See, the Sage way to be a Fuzzy
does not involve dope jams.

01:03:43.377 --> 01:03:47.256
But it is my way to be a Fuzzy,
and if I say so myself,

01:03:47.296 --> 01:03:48.589
it is dynamite.

01:03:48.631 --> 01:03:51.135
Wait, so your magic
didn't fade after a year?

01:03:51.176 --> 01:03:54.138
Let me explain.
See, I came to Sage as an orphan.

01:03:54.638 --> 01:03:58.934
And knowing I had nobody to go home to,
Sage let me stay on and groundskeep.

01:03:59.309 --> 01:04:03.439
Eventually they let me work with the UDMs,
'cause, you know,

01:04:03.479 --> 01:04:05.982
it takes a weirdo to teach a weirdo.
No offense, weirdos.

01:04:06.024 --> 01:04:07.276
None taken.

01:04:07.859 --> 01:04:10.528
- But you didn't answer NoryÂ´s question.
- Up high.

01:04:12.113 --> 01:04:15.617
- She gets one? Come on!
- You know what?

01:04:15.658 --> 01:04:18.953
Let's just say I manage
to practice my magic on the sly.

01:04:19.787 --> 01:04:22.707
It keeps me from fully losing
what few marbles I got left.

01:04:22.749 --> 01:04:25.042
Anyway, you guys
head back to the bunks,

01:04:25.461 --> 01:04:30.048
chill out and get some rest.
Tomorrow, we get to work.

01:04:36.888 --> 01:04:38.140
Hey, you okay?

01:04:38.890 --> 01:04:41.976
Today started awful,
and then it got way better.

01:04:42.435 --> 01:04:44.396
- But...
- But?

01:04:44.772 --> 01:04:46.523
My best friend, Reina?

01:04:47.441 --> 01:04:50.819
- Her magic was weird at the Sage Match.
- Weird how?

01:04:51.111 --> 01:04:53.280
Just, like different, more intense.

01:04:53.781 --> 01:04:55.199
- Oh, well, I'm sure...
- I mean,

01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:57.993
she's probably been working
really hard to sharpen her powers.

01:04:58.327 --> 01:05:00.370
I guess they probably are different.

01:05:00.703 --> 01:05:03.457
- Yeah, totally.
- I could just go talk to her about it.

01:05:03.707 --> 01:05:05.209
- You could...
- I will.

01:05:05.501 --> 01:05:08.669
Thanks for helping me out, Andres!
You give really good advice.

01:05:11.423 --> 01:05:12.549
Glad I could help.

01:05:26.229 --> 01:05:28.481
Good evening.

01:05:29.482 --> 01:05:30.776
What are you doing here?

01:05:30.818 --> 01:05:32.944
I just wanted to offer my congratulations.

01:05:33.236 --> 01:05:36.280
On winning the Sage Match,
and on the ensuing...

01:05:37.323 --> 01:05:38.325
fireworks.

01:05:39.785 --> 01:05:40.911
What was that?

01:05:42.453 --> 01:05:44.664
I could have killed my friend!

01:05:44.705 --> 01:05:48.292
Well, the thing about this particular book
of magic is it's not really an...

01:05:49.002 --> 01:05:50.379
"a la carte" situation.

01:05:52.548 --> 01:05:54.716
You can't pick just one thing from it.

01:05:56.051 --> 01:05:57.553
Not without some...

01:05:58.303 --> 01:05:59.430
side effects.

01:06:05.477 --> 01:06:06.478
Get out!

01:06:08.229 --> 01:06:09.689
And take the book with you.

01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:25.914
I said take the book!

01:06:27.957 --> 01:06:31.252
You did. Just now. Real loud.

01:06:35.214 --> 01:06:37.800
Hey, hey, Reina!

01:06:38.718 --> 01:06:40.303
Wait, you're not supposed to be in here.

01:06:40.803 --> 01:06:43.807
I mean, technically IÂ´m not supposed to be
anywhere.

01:06:43.848 --> 01:06:45.517
Okay, what's up? Can I come in?

01:06:47.019 --> 01:06:50.606
Uh, I'm tired. It's been a long day.
I need to sleep.

01:06:50.981 --> 01:06:52.649
We'll catch up later, I promise.

01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:54.068
- But...
- Nory, go.

01:06:56.153 --> 01:06:58.488
- Please.
- Okay, but...

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:24.405
So, in order to sharpen our magic
we need to turn ourselves into pretzels?

01:07:24.947 --> 01:07:27.617
Well, sort of. Here's the thing,

01:07:27.867 --> 01:07:30.746
I've been observing this school's
training techniques for years.

01:07:30.787 --> 01:07:34.082
And it's fine, for them.
But in my noggin,

01:07:34.374 --> 01:07:37.126
IÂ´ve been coming up
with a counter-curriculum for UDMs.

01:07:38.503 --> 01:07:39.755
Stuff like this...

01:07:40.171 --> 01:07:43.217
- is a big part of it.
- Why?

01:07:43.258 --> 01:07:45.093
Because, we gotta focus all that

01:07:45.468 --> 01:07:48.054
jiggety-jaggety puberty energy
you guys have.

01:07:48.639 --> 01:07:51.349
Control your bodies, control your powers.

01:07:52.226 --> 01:07:53.309
Now...

01:07:58.356 --> 01:07:59.483
...focus on your power.

01:08:00.608 --> 01:08:02.360
Picture it in your mind's eye.

01:08:02.403 --> 01:08:05.988
And picture it doing exactly
what you want it to do.

01:08:07.615 --> 01:08:10.702
Elliot, what do you want your power
to do?

01:08:10.744 --> 01:08:13.496
I want to be able to shoot fire
like the other Flares.

01:08:13.746 --> 01:08:15.081
Okay, well, you can't.

01:08:15.124 --> 01:08:17.710
It's like asking an orange
to be a pickup truck.

01:08:17.750 --> 01:08:19.711
It ain't gonna happen, right?
But...

01:08:20.086 --> 01:08:22.339
what do you want your power to do?

01:08:25.968 --> 01:08:30.013
I guess, I want to be able to control it.

01:08:30.596 --> 01:08:33.599
Like, make smoke go
where I want it to go?

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:35.853
Yes! Fam, you see that?

01:08:35.893 --> 01:08:39.606
Don't focus on what you can't do.
Focus on what you can do.

01:08:39.647 --> 01:08:42.274
And do it as well as you possibly can.

01:08:43.234 --> 01:08:44.193
Pepper.

01:08:45.194 --> 01:08:48.782
I wanna be able to push things away
from me when I wanna.

01:08:49.532 --> 01:08:52.410
- Like you.
- Oh. Right.

01:08:52.827 --> 01:08:55.747
You know what? That's perfect.
We can do that.

01:08:56.205 --> 01:08:57.165
Nory.

01:08:57.206 --> 01:08:59.917
I want to be able to choose what animal
I flux into.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:03.714
- Oh, come on, animal?
- Sorry. Animals.

01:09:03.755 --> 01:09:04.881
Boom!

01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:06.591
Andres.

01:09:09.219 --> 01:09:10.220
My man!

01:09:11.095 --> 01:09:13.973
- I don't know.
- Okay. Well, you know what?

01:09:14.558 --> 01:09:17.269
Be with that for now.
Embrace the uncertainty.

01:09:17.518 --> 01:09:21.189
Because I have got a plan for you.
I promise.

01:09:30.948 --> 01:09:34.827
This is your plan? A hose?
A hose is your plan?

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:38.332
It's a prelude to a plan.
Okay? Let me ask you this.

01:09:38.581 --> 01:09:41.584
Have you ever just tried
to see how far up you go?

01:09:41.876 --> 01:09:42.835
No.

01:09:42.877 --> 01:09:46.756
Look, my mom told me that if I didn't
have my bag, IÂ´d just fly away into space,

01:09:46.799 --> 01:09:49.051
and be gone forever,
and I'd get sucked into a black hole,

01:09:49.093 --> 01:09:52.970
- and my eyes would pop out of my head...
- Your mom has a really vivid imagination.

01:09:53.013 --> 01:09:55.933
Now. Hear me out.
Drop the bag.

01:09:57.643 --> 01:09:59.269
I... I can't.

01:09:59.311 --> 01:10:02.981
Um, counterpoint, you totally can.

01:10:04.775 --> 01:10:06.151
You got this.

01:10:06.902 --> 01:10:08.028
Okay.

01:10:30.008 --> 01:10:34.638
- Whoo! This is amazing!
- Okay. I'm letting go.

01:10:39.601 --> 01:10:40.643
Hey!

01:10:43.187 --> 01:10:44.230
Whoo!

01:10:45.773 --> 01:10:48.192
I'm not in space!
My eyes are still in my head!

01:10:48.235 --> 01:10:50.946
Yeah, they sure are!
And, hey, I hope you know!

01:10:50.987 --> 01:10:54.615
That's faster than any Flyer
can launch, Rocket-boy!

01:10:55.034 --> 01:10:56.201
I do now!

01:10:56.535 --> 01:10:58.829
I love it! That's me! Rocket-boy!

01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:01.956
Okay, so, the thing we're gonna work on
with you,

01:11:01.999 --> 01:11:04.168
is controlling all that launch power.

01:11:04.710 --> 01:11:06.503
- Sound good?
- Sounds great!

01:11:07.004 --> 01:11:10.466
- Uh, can you help me get down?
- Yeah, right.

01:11:26.314 --> 01:11:30.568
If I didn't know any better,
which I do, IÂ´d say

01:11:30.611 --> 01:11:33.613
you're making me rake while you
lean against that tree and do nothing.

01:11:33.655 --> 01:11:37.117
I mean, I would do it,
but you're real good with that rake.

01:11:37.159 --> 01:11:39.202
Like, you push the leaves with it,

01:11:39.244 --> 01:11:42.581
and the leaves go
where you want them to go.

01:11:48.253 --> 01:11:50.130
I bet there's an easier way to do it.

01:12:06.146 --> 01:12:07.272
No!

01:12:08.648 --> 01:12:10.566
Not quite there yet.

01:12:18.616 --> 01:12:22.161
Okay, they've been wanting me to get rid
of this beehive for, like, a minute.

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:23.746
So, here's the plan.

01:12:23.789 --> 01:12:26.791
I'm gonna knock it down,
and then you're gonna smoke 'em out.

01:12:26.834 --> 01:12:30.295
- I am? When?
- Right about...

01:12:32.464 --> 01:12:33.424
now!

01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:39.513
- Oh, close. Really close.
- What about the bees?

01:12:41.723 --> 01:12:46.686
Bees, let me offer my apologies

01:12:47.646 --> 01:12:49.273
But we need you

01:12:49.313 --> 01:12:54.027
To find another hive

01:12:54.068 --> 01:12:56.821
And we thank you in advance

01:12:56.863 --> 01:13:02.160
Bye-bye

01:13:20.012 --> 01:13:22.097
Exactly how many of these things
do I have to do?

01:13:22.513 --> 01:13:26.017
- Um, like, a million zillion.
- But it's so boring.

01:13:26.059 --> 01:13:27.811
OMG, I know.

01:13:27.853 --> 01:13:30.189
I mean, it's almost like you're learning
how to visualize

01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:33.567
and physically manifest
animal combinations.

01:13:35.527 --> 01:13:36.570
TouchÃ©.

01:13:36.987 --> 01:13:39.531
Here, take a break.
The dritten can wait.

01:13:39.572 --> 01:13:41.491
Wait, what's a dritten?

01:13:42.367 --> 01:13:45.454
A dragon-kitten, dritten.

01:13:46.371 --> 01:13:50.834
- Dritten. I like it.
- Yeah, this is a dritten.

01:13:51.293 --> 01:13:52.920
That's a kittiphant.

01:13:53.253 --> 01:13:54.880
That's a sharkitten,
and so on.

01:13:54.921 --> 01:13:58.467
Like, the more you can see
and know and name these things,

01:13:58.509 --> 01:14:01.053
the more you can fully be them. Right?

01:14:01.929 --> 01:14:02.930
Right.

01:14:03.930 --> 01:14:06.974
Dritten. Dritten. Dritten. Dritten.

01:14:07.518 --> 01:14:10.687
Oh, no
What's going on here

01:14:10.728 --> 01:14:13.606
My world is turned around
And I'm upside down

01:14:13.648 --> 01:14:16.610
Like, oh, oh, right out of nowhere...

01:14:16.652 --> 01:14:17.653
What?

01:14:17.695 --> 01:14:20.781
My feet are up off the ground
And I'm upside down...

01:14:20.822 --> 01:14:21.990
Nice!

01:14:22.031 --> 01:14:25.410
All of a sudden the bottom floor
Is the top floor

01:14:25.451 --> 01:14:28.539
The top floor beneath my feet
And man it feels so low

01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:31.875
Everything's changing
This situation's taking me on a ride

01:14:32.250 --> 01:14:35.838
All over, around now, chasing me down
And I got no place to hide

01:14:35.879 --> 01:14:37.296
If everyone could walk...

01:14:37.339 --> 01:14:38.924
Because you're wonky.

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:42.928
The king of that world no one would dare
To knock on my door botherin' me

01:14:42.969 --> 01:14:46.472
I'm feelin' the speed
Been feeling this H-E-A-T

01:14:46.514 --> 01:14:50.352
Inevitable, it's out of control
Turning me inside out and upside down

01:14:50.602 --> 01:14:53.564
Oh, no
What's going on here

01:14:53.604 --> 01:14:56.733
My world has turned around
And I'm upside down

01:14:56.775 --> 01:14:59.027
Like, oh, oh

01:14:59.068 --> 01:15:01.112
Right outta nowhere

01:15:01.155 --> 01:15:05.284
My feet are up off the ground
And I'm upside down now

01:15:05.325 --> 01:15:08.537
Knocked down, right down
Down, down, down

01:15:08.579 --> 01:15:12.124
Smacked down, right down
Down, down, down

01:15:12.165 --> 01:15:15.543
Man down, man down
Down, down, down

01:15:15.585 --> 01:15:19.255
So, turn around right now
Down, down, down

01:15:19.298 --> 01:15:21.925
My world's flipped inside and out
I've been in a cloud, but now

01:15:21.967 --> 01:15:24.428
Instead of livin' it up
I'm livin' it down

01:15:24.678 --> 01:15:26.638
Looked as a clown
The frown I've caused

01:15:26.972 --> 01:15:28.682
Assume you're the king
Then do a few things

01:15:28.723 --> 01:15:30.058
Don't think there's a price to pay

01:15:30.099 --> 01:15:33.394
But look at me now, I've been in a cage
And put my life on delay

01:15:41.402 --> 01:15:42.737
- Meow!
- Meow!

01:15:49.161 --> 01:15:51.497
Upside down now

01:15:51.537 --> 01:15:55.250
Knocked down, right down
Down, down, down

01:15:55.291 --> 01:15:58.711
Smacked down, right down
Down, down, down

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:02.256
Man down, man down
Down, down, down...

01:16:02.299 --> 01:16:05.803
So turn around right now
Down, down, down

01:16:15.062 --> 01:16:17.981
- You're better than all of them, you know.
- Go away.

01:16:18.022 --> 01:16:21.610
I'm afraid I can't do that.
You already used my book.

01:16:22.902 --> 01:16:26.365
You're stuck with me.
So why fight it?

01:16:29.242 --> 01:16:32.495
Just look at these fools
with their parlor tricks.

01:16:33.205 --> 01:16:38.168
Writing their names. Popping corn.
Sparkly fireballs.

01:16:39.460 --> 01:16:41.088
You team up with me...

01:16:42.589 --> 01:16:44.883
we can have real power.

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:49.304
- Just say the word.
- No! I said go away!

01:16:50.263 --> 01:16:55.017
- Hey, Reina, are you okay?
- Chandra! She won't leave me alone!

01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:56.519
Who's Chandra?

01:16:56.562 --> 01:16:58.856
What do you mean, "Who's Chandra?"
She's right here!

01:17:00.232 --> 01:17:02.985
- There's... There's nobody there.
- What?

01:17:03.485 --> 01:17:05.612
I forgot to tell you, Reina...

01:17:06.780 --> 01:17:09.116
you're the only one who can see me.

01:17:17.415 --> 01:17:19.375
I'm gonna go.

01:17:42.691 --> 01:17:46.445
Stop! Stop running from your destiny.

01:17:46.487 --> 01:17:50.574
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to know your worth, Reina.

01:17:53.701 --> 01:17:55.829
You don't think you're good enough,
do you?

01:17:56.705 --> 01:18:01.418
You think everyone here is better than you
and you are wrong.

01:18:04.129 --> 01:18:06.423
Reginald thought
he wasn't good enough either.

01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:11.844
- Who?
- A former Flare. A former friend.

01:18:12.638 --> 01:18:17.226
He was very insecure,
but he was very powerful.

01:18:18.684 --> 01:18:23.314
You are even more insecure,
but even more powerful.

01:18:24.482 --> 01:18:28.736
He was good. But you, Reina...

01:18:30.613 --> 01:18:32.491
are perfect.

01:18:34.451 --> 01:18:39.707
Yes, good, smile,
revel in your perfection.

01:18:40.206 --> 01:18:42.459
Everyone will know of it soon.

01:18:47.296 --> 01:18:49.883
- What's happening?
- You are.

01:18:51.134 --> 01:18:53.052
Whether you know it or not,

01:18:53.094 --> 01:18:56.013
you are accepting the shadow magic
into you.

01:18:56.848 --> 01:19:02.395
You are tired of hiding in the shadows,
when you can be the shadow.

01:19:02.687 --> 01:19:03.688
Say it.

01:19:04.772 --> 01:19:06.315
Say you're tired.

01:19:07.233 --> 01:19:10.446
- I'm tired!
- Then wake up.

01:19:17.244 --> 01:19:20.371
Hey! Sparkplugs!
Any of you seen Reina?

01:19:20.789 --> 01:19:24.418
Well! If it isn't the UDM
who nearly destroyed the Founders Hall

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:27.296
by turning into some kind
of crazy monster.

01:19:28.129 --> 01:19:32.258
Yeah, and I was in a good mood.
But now, IÂ´m in a bad mood.

01:19:33.509 --> 01:19:35.344
- She went that way.
- Thanks.

01:19:47.691 --> 01:19:50.568
- We are awake.
- Reina!

01:19:55.741 --> 01:19:57.910
We are not Reina.

01:19:58.869 --> 01:20:03.540
We are the thing
that has been waiting all these years.

01:20:04.832 --> 01:20:06.210
Shadow magic.

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:09.713
- So you don't only prey on UDMs.
- Of course not.

01:20:11.506 --> 01:20:14.927
But soon we will prey on everyone.

01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:19.639
We will bring this entire school
to its knees.

01:20:21.058 --> 01:20:22.393
But for now...

01:20:23.768 --> 01:20:26.479
we will start with you!

01:20:30.692 --> 01:20:35.280
- Reina, I'm gonna save you. I promise.
- We do not need saving!

01:20:46.165 --> 01:20:48.168
C'mon, dorks, tell me where she went.

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.796
If anyone from the school
sees her out there after curfew,

01:20:50.838 --> 01:20:52.005
we're all hosed.

01:20:52.046 --> 01:20:54.883
- How'd you even know she snuck out?
- Um, a little bird told me.

01:20:55.134 --> 01:20:57.886
Literally. His name's Todd.
Todd the little bird.

01:20:57.928 --> 01:21:01.515
Skriff! Reina! Shadow magic, the school.

01:21:01.557 --> 01:21:03.267
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down.

01:21:03.642 --> 01:21:06.437
My best friend Reina
has been acting weird,

01:21:06.478 --> 01:21:10.190
and her magic wasn't hers.
But it's because the shadow magic got her.

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:12.735
And she said it's gonna bring
the entire school to its knees!

01:21:14.902 --> 01:21:15.903
Wow.

01:21:17.531 --> 01:21:18.948
No way.

01:21:24.537 --> 01:21:25.997
- Well?
- I'm thinking.

01:21:26.040 --> 01:21:28.332
And it's been a minute
since IÂ´ve done that,

01:21:28.375 --> 01:21:30.836
- so I would appreciate the patience.
- Let's get out there and stop it!

01:21:31.295 --> 01:21:33.672
It's probably destroying the school
right now! Come on!

01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:38.343
No. You guys...

01:21:41.138 --> 01:21:42.723
- it's waiting.
- For what?

01:21:43.014 --> 01:21:45.433
For when it can do the most damage.

01:21:49.812 --> 01:21:54.233
French bread pizza day!

01:21:56.152 --> 01:21:59.490
What? It's like the most popular day
at the dining hall!

01:21:59.531 --> 01:22:02.201
Everyone loves French bread pizza!

01:22:02.241 --> 01:22:04.327
- I mean, it is really good.
- Fresh basil.

01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:05.871
- They know what they're doing.
- Yeah.

01:22:07.539 --> 01:22:08.499
FoundersÂ´ Day.

01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:10.793
Boom.

01:22:10.834 --> 01:22:14.046
FoundersÂ´ Day is tomorrow. We go
to Knightslinger right now and tell her.

01:22:14.088 --> 01:22:15.214
Tell her what, exactly?

01:22:15.254 --> 01:22:17.965
You think she's gonna believe you,
after everything you've pulled?

01:22:18.008 --> 01:22:21.345
Because I know she won't.
Then nobody will be able to help you.

01:22:21.387 --> 01:22:24.473
- So, what can we do?
- We can get some rest.

01:22:24.807 --> 01:22:28.477
We need to make darn sure we're ready
for anything tomorrow. Okay?

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:29.978
- Okay!
- Okay!

01:22:45.119 --> 01:22:46.995
What a beautiful morning.

01:22:53.126 --> 01:22:54.878
They'll never see it coming.

01:22:59.799 --> 01:23:04.262
Okay. Well, I guess this is the part
where I should probably...

01:23:05.263 --> 01:23:07.849
say something inspiring. So, um...

01:23:10.309 --> 01:23:12.019
something inspiring.

01:23:14.939 --> 01:23:18.777
Did you mean to say that you believe
in each and every one of us,

01:23:18.818 --> 01:23:21.530
and that as long as we have faith
in ourselves, and each other,

01:23:21.571 --> 01:23:23.239
there's no evil we can't conquer?

01:23:24.491 --> 01:23:25.534
Maybe?

01:23:26.326 --> 01:23:31.372
And that even though the school sees us
as a bunch of mess-ups and wackos,

01:23:31.415 --> 01:23:34.668
we're gonna save them anyway
because that's the right thing to do.

01:23:35.085 --> 01:23:36.378
Yeah, that's pretty...

01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:39.965
And no matter what happens,
no matter how today turns out,

01:23:40.465 --> 01:23:44.719
we can say that we gave it our all
by doing the thing we do best,

01:23:44.762 --> 01:23:46.472
which is being our truest selves!

01:23:46.722 --> 01:23:49.724
So, let's get out there
and kick shadow magic's stupid butt!

01:23:49.767 --> 01:23:50.976
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

01:23:51.018 --> 01:23:53.771
I mean, I wouldn't have said
"stupid butt," but yeah,

01:23:53.812 --> 01:23:55.397
the rest of that sounds really good.

01:23:55.981 --> 01:23:57.273
Let's go!

01:24:00.235 --> 01:24:05.198
Students, faculty, distinguished alumni.

01:24:05.866 --> 01:24:09.745
Welcome to Founder's Day.

01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.671
Today, we celebrate all things Sage.

01:24:20.004 --> 01:24:23.758
Our grand traditions, our thrilling past

01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:27.262
and our brilliant future.

01:24:33.309 --> 01:24:39.357
Now, let the cavalcade of talent begin!

01:24:43.903 --> 01:24:45.947
I'd like to bring to the stage

01:24:45.988 --> 01:24:50.076
one of our most promising
first-year students.

01:24:50.576 --> 01:24:53.287
Reina Carvajal!

01:24:59.420 --> 01:25:04.967
Reina, come on up here
and show 'em what you got!

01:25:30.659 --> 01:25:32.201
You think that's impressive?

01:25:38.375 --> 01:25:40.044
Wanna see something even better?

01:25:46.215 --> 01:25:47.593
Okay.

01:25:48.844 --> 01:25:50.596
You asked for it.

01:26:16.789 --> 01:26:19.791
Distinguished alumni...

01:26:20.500 --> 01:26:24.045
...it has been far too long.

01:26:27.424 --> 01:26:32.137
But I promise my return
will be very...

01:26:33.638 --> 01:26:34.847
memorable.

01:26:45.067 --> 01:26:47.986
Look upon me with wonder...

01:26:51.365 --> 01:26:57.036
for I will be the last thing
any of you ever see!

01:27:10.008 --> 01:27:12.428
- Shadow magic!
- But how?

01:27:12.719 --> 01:27:17.473
She isn't a UDM!
Clearly, we were wrong about that!

01:27:18.683 --> 01:27:20.351
Not today, shadow!

01:27:21.144 --> 01:27:23.438
Flares! Shut it down!

01:27:25.357 --> 01:27:26.734
Launch fireball!

01:27:31.571 --> 01:27:37.201
Fuzzies, we need your animal allies!
Summon the birds of prey!

01:27:38.077 --> 01:27:40.455
Birds attack!

01:27:50.049 --> 01:27:51.425
Flyers!

01:27:59.223 --> 01:28:02.769
What are you all doing?
Fly harder!

01:28:03.062 --> 01:28:07.733
Obviously the monster's power is forcing
them back down to earth, Linda!

01:28:07.775 --> 01:28:12.737
Do not call me Linda
in front of the students!

01:28:13.571 --> 01:28:16.407
Fluxers! Take your animal forms!

01:28:21.455 --> 01:28:25.584
Oh, okay, not exactly fierce!
Never mind!

01:28:26.125 --> 01:28:27.418
Solid effort, though!

01:28:27.960 --> 01:28:31.423
Flickers! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:28:32.049 --> 01:28:35.010
Tear it apart!

01:28:43.393 --> 01:28:45.686
Now
there's even more of them!

01:28:46.729 --> 01:28:48.398
I'm doomed!

01:28:48.439 --> 01:28:52.068
- We've tried everything!
- No! Not everything!

01:28:53.195 --> 01:28:54.987
There's one school left.

01:28:58.784 --> 01:29:02.371
What are you going to do, Skriff?
You're upside down!

01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:05.623
Yeah, and we're here to turn things
right-side up.

01:29:08.626 --> 01:29:10.586
Let's narrow the playing field!

01:29:13.131 --> 01:29:16.218
That's it! Push it back
into one monster again!

01:29:17.428 --> 01:29:21.598
You got this! Yes!
That's it! You're doing it!

01:29:27.603 --> 01:29:29.939
Elliot!

01:29:31.650 --> 01:29:33.902
- You got it! Yes!
- Smoke it out!

01:29:37.447 --> 01:29:40.450
Yeah, it can't see through all that smoke!

01:29:41.451 --> 01:29:43.619
Yeah!

01:29:43.911 --> 01:29:46.205
Andres, now!

01:29:46.956 --> 01:29:47.915
Hey! Monster!

01:29:50.335 --> 01:29:51.378
Come at me, bro!

01:29:54.505 --> 01:29:56.340
- You need to go!
- Come on! Do it!

01:29:56.842 --> 01:30:00.137
Come on, Rocket-boy!

01:30:01.638 --> 01:30:03.265
Make it chase you.

01:30:06.268 --> 01:30:07.352
Pepper, now!

01:30:13.025 --> 01:30:14.567
It's getting tangled up!

01:30:15.568 --> 01:30:16.652
Yes!

01:30:17.196 --> 01:30:18.906
Okay, Nory, take us home!

01:30:18.946 --> 01:30:23.284
Okay. Dritten. Dritten. Dritten!

01:30:25.661 --> 01:30:27.747
Get it to try and catch you!

01:30:28.999 --> 01:30:30.541
Yeah, Nory,

01:30:30.584 --> 01:30:33.295
- you're too fast for it!
- It's working!

01:30:33.336 --> 01:30:34.463
It can't catch you!

01:30:34.504 --> 01:30:37.006
- Come on!
- Come on, Nory! You're doing it!

01:30:38.592 --> 01:30:41.719
- It's all twisted around!
- It's getting tired!

01:30:43.930 --> 01:30:47.058
- Yeah, kick that monster's stupid butt!
- Come on!

01:30:47.558 --> 01:30:49.268
It's getting dizzy!

01:30:52.272 --> 01:30:56.860
- It's tangled, it's gonna fall!
- Come on! Show it who's boss!

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:04.992
It's down! Finish it off!

01:31:05.244 --> 01:31:06.786
- Flares!
- Flyers!

01:31:06.829 --> 01:31:08.621
Fuzzies! Fluxers!

01:31:13.710 --> 01:31:15.713
Skriff! What is your girl doing?

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:19.382
We can destroy this thing!

01:31:19.424 --> 01:31:22.593
Yeah, well, "this thing"
is her best friend.

01:31:32.396 --> 01:31:34.732
Reina! Reina, I know you're in there.

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:38.110
Reina, I need you to fight harder
than you've ever fought in your life.

01:31:40.362 --> 01:31:41.613
Reina, listen to me!

01:31:42.281 --> 01:31:46.869
You are a flame-throwing rock star.
And this is a lot.

01:31:47.494 --> 01:31:50.581
But... we got this.

01:32:08.723 --> 01:32:11.434
- What is that?
- Sparkle Fireball.

01:32:11.977 --> 01:32:14.688
For sure, no doubt.
It's my favorite.

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:19.442
Reina, you got this!

01:32:29.411 --> 01:32:30.412
Reina!

01:32:32.622 --> 01:32:33.540
Are you okay?

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.001
Come on.

01:32:53.977 --> 01:32:55.062
Nory?

01:32:56.146 --> 01:32:57.356
Yeah, Reina?

01:32:58.147 --> 01:33:00.608
Remember when I said
I was doing great?

01:33:01.693 --> 01:33:02.695
Yeah?

01:33:03.403 --> 01:33:04.612
I wasn't.

01:33:05.446 --> 01:33:08.199
I wasn't, either.

01:33:09.117 --> 01:33:12.745
But IÂ´ll tell you what,
I'm doing a lot better now.

01:33:13.539 --> 01:33:14.456
Me, too.

01:33:16.541 --> 01:33:19.085
Up high!

01:33:21.546 --> 01:33:25.759
Yes! We did it!

01:33:32.473 --> 01:33:36.811
As you can imagine, Sage underwent
a lot of changes after that.

01:33:38.604 --> 01:33:41.400
The UDM program was discontinued,

01:33:41.442 --> 01:33:44.445
and all of us UDMs
joined our respective schools.

01:33:48.991 --> 01:33:50.909
Elliot's an official Flare.

01:33:57.457 --> 01:34:00.669
Andres is flying circles
around the Flyers.

01:34:05.799 --> 01:34:08.177
Pepper's a star amongst Flickers.

01:34:12.473 --> 01:34:16.185
Skriff is knocking them dead
as an official Fuzzy professor.

01:34:17.018 --> 01:34:19.854
Come on let's show
'Em how it's done

01:34:20.229 --> 01:34:22.566
Because we wanna make it fun

01:34:24.067 --> 01:34:26.527
- And me?
- Hmm.

01:34:26.945 --> 01:34:29.865
Kitten, panda, penguin.

01:34:30.741 --> 01:34:32.534
Oh. Is that all?

01:34:33.285 --> 01:34:34.286
Step back.

01:34:34.327 --> 01:34:35.370
Reina was right.

01:34:35.829 --> 01:34:39.832
Sage is teaching me to be
the best abomination I can be!

01:34:47.049 --> 01:34:49.968
Pretty soon,
everyone forgot about the Sage way.

01:34:50.510 --> 01:34:51.762
That's the old way.

01:34:52.095 --> 01:34:54.680
The new way is to let kids be themselves.

01:34:55.223 --> 01:34:58.059
After all, everybody has their something.

01:34:59.311 --> 01:35:02.648
And letting everybody be the most
of their something they can be...

01:35:03.648 --> 01:35:05.942
that's the real magic.
