Hello

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.340
Feel free to explore our shop...

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.340
Thanks.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.180
I choose this one.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.980
Here's money.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.980
Thank you so much.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.500
Are you studying at MTR school?

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.500
Yes, I'm.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.580
Are you alumni?

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.580
Yes, I'm.

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.580
What a small world!

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:52.740
Are you interested in a ceramics workshop?

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.860
That's quite interesting.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.340
I have to go now.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.980
Just a second.

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.980
You forgot the change.

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.700
Thanks so much.

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.060
My name's Tiew.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.020
I'm Mork.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.020
Nice to meet you...

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.940
I have to leave now.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.940
I've met a guy.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.940
His name is P' Tiew...

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.620
WTF?

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:58.420
I lost some money again!

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.820
It's such a bad day!

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.820
Hi, P'Tiew.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.620
Who are you?

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.300
I'm Mork!

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:26.140
I'm not sure that I know you.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.700
Mork, a student from MTR school. We met at the ceramics shop yesterday.

00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.060
Are you sure that I'm the one you're looking for?

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.140
What a crazy day!

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.380
I lost some money and that he has a wrong person.

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.300
Are you sure that you don't know me?

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.700
It's my turn!

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.620
You've a lot of money.

00:08:35.020 --> 00:08:37.020
I think I left my wallet around here...

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.620
I was sit here.

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.620
Where is it?

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.620
Where's my wallet?

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.620
What da heck!

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.180
Oh! it's such a very bad day!

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.580
Excuse me?

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.580
The weather's so hot!

00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.580
It's really hot today!

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.580
My wallet is with you - Nong Mork, isn't it?

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:24.580
So, you remember me now?

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.580
Are you sure this wallet is yours?

00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:32.580
Thanks so much.

00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:34.580
You lose!

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.580
Lose?

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.580
What do I lose?

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:52.900
This morning, you pretended you didn't know me.

00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.900
Okay! I admit that I lose.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.900
Will you let me take you home?

00:10:06.900 --> 00:10:08.900
No, thanks.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:10.900
I rode my bicycle this morning.

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:14.620
Ai P' Tiew!

00:10:18.140 --> 00:10:21.300
You don't respect me as your senior!

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:25.540
since you knew me that I was your old school's senior.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.780
You're having so much fun.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.340
You can treat me like I'm your friend next time!

00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:32.980
Wow! Really?

00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.980
Opps!

00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:37.620
Just kidding!

00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:44.700
Ai P' Tiew!

00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:55.940
Anyway...

00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:01.860
Whatever you want to name me, it's fine for me.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.900
Absolutely! Ai P' Tiew!

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.900
Now you're pushing it too far!

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.220
Anyway, let's go.

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:16.940
Where will we go?

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:18.940
My house.

00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.940
Go with me!

00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:18.740
I know what you're looking at.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:20.740
What am I looking at?

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.740
You're looking at my six-pack abs!

00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.380
It's not true! I've not looked at yours.

00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:36.580
You use dubiously high-pitched.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:38.580
Are you interested in me?

00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.580
Hey!

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.580
If you invite me to come here and see your six-pack abs, please do not invite me again.

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.340
Will you join me in swimming?

00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:29.340
I won't.

00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.500
It's so cold.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:38.580
Are you afraid that your six-pack abs are less attractive than mine?

00:14:40.580 --> 00:14:42.580
I think you want to see my six-pack abs!

00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.580
Yes!

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.580
Are you brave to show me yours?

00:14:52.420 --> 00:14:56.860
Rare item like this, it's not so easy to let you see!

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.500
Show me what you got!

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.300
Swim with me!

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:02.620
Nope!!

00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:04.100
Please...

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.100
What are you doing? I'm getting wet.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.700
Please...

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.700
I'm afraid not.

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:12.740
No no no!

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.740
May I see your rare item? Please...

00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:16.740
No way!

00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:18.700
Take off your clothes

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:19.200
Nope!!

00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:23.180
Okay.

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:25.180
I won't tease you then.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.180
Do you have any plans for tomorrow?

00:15:29.180 --> 00:15:31.180
I have no idea. Why?

00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:33.180
What will you want me to do?

00:15:36.420 --> 00:15:38.420
I will let you know.

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:44.940
You like teasing me!

00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.020
I don't want to get wet!

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:14.540
Tomorrow, I have the appointment with Ai P' Tiew.

00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:34.900
This is for you.

00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:49.900
P' Tiew...

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.900
Let's have the ice cream challenge.

00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:56.540
The loser has to eat everything the winner cooks.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:58.540
Are you sure?

00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.540
Why not?

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:02.540
Are you afraid that you will be a loser?

00:18:04.540 --> 00:18:06.540
Deal!

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:38.420
Why are you laughing?

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:40.420
Nothing at all

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.220
But you're still laughing....

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:47.220
Your face looks so funny.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.220
Really?

00:18:52.780 --> 00:18:54.340
Are you sure?

00:18:54.340 --> 00:18:56.340
Yes, of course!

00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:00.340
Mork...

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.340
I've just finished eating the second ice cream.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.340
You're loser!

00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:42.340
Shall we skip this round?

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:48.900
No way!

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:51.700
It's too cold!

00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:55.180
I can't eat it all.

00:19:55.180 --> 00:19:57.180
Please.....

00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.180
No!

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.500
I got brain freeze like you but I can resist.

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.500
Skip this challenge, please....

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:06.740
This challenge was proposed by you, and you lose!.

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:08.380
As the winner, I have to follow the rules.

00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:10.900
Please, please, please...

00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:12.900
Please, please, please....

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.420
Please skip this round.

00:20:14.420 --> 00:20:16.900
You don't have to beg me.

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:18.900
Rules are rules.

00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:20.900
You have to eat it all.

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.900
No, no, no, no, no...

00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:28.900
Mai, mai, mai, mai... (Mai in Thai means No)

00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:30.900
I'll not be kind-hearted for you.

00:20:30.900 --> 00:20:32.900
Eat it all!

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:34.900
Open your mouth, and eat it all.

00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:35.660
Eat it!

00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:36.100
It's extremely cold.

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:38.100
Eat it!!!

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.100
That's it!!

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.620
Next time, make sure that you challenge the right person.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:04.740
Our meal is ready.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.740
Khao Soi

00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.620
Famous and delicious dish.

00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.540
Thanks so much.

00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:18.540
Please try.

00:21:18.540 --> 00:21:20.540
You try first.

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.900
Let me try another dish.

00:21:37.580 --> 00:21:39.580
Up to you...

00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.980
Aroi! (Delicious)

00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:23.980
It's salty!!!

00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.980
Just eat it!

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.260
It's so salty.

00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.260
But you have to eat because of our deal.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:41.940
The loser needs to eat everything that the winner orders.

00:22:41.940 --> 00:22:45.340
So eat it!

00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:03.100
Okay, you can eat my dish.

00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:06.820
Wow!

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:10.180
You're so nice!

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:47.780
Why don't you eat?

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.420
This dish is for the loser only. So I, as the winner, can not eat!.

00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.420
I think you don't eat it because it's salty.

00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.500
P'Tiew...

00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:50.500
I have a story to tell you...

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:53.860
There's a story of the Tha Phae Gate...

00:24:53.860 --> 00:25:02.780
If we walk from the end of wall to the center of the Tha Phae Gate with 99 steps completely,

00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:04.780
you'll find your soulmate.

00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.860
Really?

00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:22.540
Hmm... Let's try...

00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.940
Why would I have to try with you?

00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.220
Are you afraid...

00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:39.500
if I try, maybe I will be your soulmate?

00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:41.500
Not really!

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:16.300
