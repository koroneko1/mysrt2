<font color="#ffff00">You're watching from StreamFlex app.</font>
Enjoy watching.

01:37.413 --> 01:39.881
Oh, we've been at
this all day, buddy, I get it.

01:39.949 --> 01:41.750
Those other spots
didn't float your boat,

01:41.816 --> 01:44.720
but wait until you see
this next place.

01:44.786 --> 01:46.321
It screams mouse house.

01:46.387 --> 01:47.422
Wait, can I say that?

01:47.488 --> 01:48.456
Is that copyrighted?

01:48.524 --> 01:49.624
Heh. There we go.

01:49.690 --> 01:51.025
Whoop. Sorry about this,

01:51.092 --> 01:53.628
the elevator's, uh,
being repaired.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.898
Boom!
I just had a vision!

01:55.964 --> 01:57.399
You're chillin'
in your new crib,

01:57.465 --> 01:58.800
but then
you get claustrophobic,

01:58.868 --> 02:01.270
and then you get dizzy,
and to save you...

02:01.336 --> 02:02.437
Ta-da!

02:02.505 --> 02:04.405
Look at that view!

02:04.473 --> 02:07.075
Resplendent, ain't it, huh?

02:07.142 --> 02:08.477
It's got everything.

02:08.543 --> 02:09.978
Built-in stereo,

02:10.044 --> 02:12.047
but be careful, those seats
are very flammable.

02:12.114 --> 02:14.649
I'm kidding.
I'm not kidding.

02:14.716 --> 02:16.652
Jerry, baby,
I know it's no beauty,

02:16.717 --> 02:17.953
but let's be honest here,

02:18.019 --> 02:20.255
with your budget,
this is all you can...

02:20.322 --> 02:22.691
Hey! You don't just Batman me.

02:22.757 --> 02:24.659
You haven't even seen
the trunk yet.

02:55.291 --> 02:57.660
Ahhh!

03:16.811 --> 03:19.681
Look, Dad. That blind cat's
playing piano.

03:19.749 --> 03:22.184
There's a lot of weird stuff
in this city.

03:22.251 --> 03:24.853
You just gotta keep walking.

03:24.919 --> 03:27.256
I mean,
he's amazing on the piano,

03:27.322 --> 03:28.658
and blind, too!

03:29.924 --> 03:31.660
That's one cool cat.

03:45.573 --> 03:47.342
Man,
that cat is out of sight!

03:49.345 --> 03:50.680
This is so cool.

03:53.781 --> 03:54.782
Whoa!

03:54.850 --> 03:56.352
Oh, wow! Isn't he cute?

04:00.989 --> 04:03.325
I thought I'd seen it all with
the blind, piano-playing cat.

04:22.643 --> 04:23.745
Oh, man.

04:31.787 --> 04:32.888
He can see!

04:32.955 --> 04:34.188
He's a fraud!

04:34.256 --> 04:35.724
He's a regular cat
playing the piano.

04:35.790 --> 04:37.425
Man, I want my money back!

05:32.280 --> 05:33.215
Ahhh.

05:41.590 --> 05:43.592
Hey. Are you okay?

05:43.657 --> 05:44.759
You gotta be careful next time.

05:44.826 --> 05:45.894
You could have really hurt me.

05:48.297 --> 05:49.732
Oh, my gosh.

05:54.570 --> 05:55.905
Suspended? Why?

05:55.970 --> 05:57.572
<i>For starters,</i>

05:57.640 --> 05:59.775
<i>the 100 pounds of underwear
strewn up 5th Avenue.</i>

05:59.840 --> 06:01.276
Oh, come on,
you can't blame me for that.

06:01.342 --> 06:03.345
That was
a cat-and-mouse situation,

06:03.410 --> 06:05.547
and everyone knows
you just don't get involved.

06:05.614 --> 06:07.114
<i>You can reapply in four weeks.</i>

06:07.181 --> 06:09.751
No. Please, sir,
please, just...

06:09.818 --> 06:12.187
You... You...
You can't do that to me.

06:12.253 --> 06:13.420
<i>Oh.</i>

06:13.487 --> 06:16.257
Last week, I helped a man
do a pull-up for an hour.

06:16.323 --> 06:18.960
An hour! He achieved
his fitness goals with me.

06:19.027 --> 06:20.562
Okay.

06:20.628 --> 06:22.864
What if I just...

06:22.931 --> 06:24.566
I come and be your assistant?

06:24.633 --> 06:26.902
<i>Ms. Forester,
you started two months ago.</i>

06:26.969 --> 06:30.138
<i>It just doesn't work like that.</i>

06:30.205 --> 06:31.873
Maybe this job
never was for me.

06:31.939 --> 06:34.175
- <i>Maybe it's not.</i>
- You know what? I quit.

06:40.982 --> 06:43.352
HORSE: Mm-hmm. Uh-huh.

06:49.157 --> 06:50.092
Whoa!

07:42.844 --> 07:44.146
- Hello.
- Hey.

07:44.212 --> 07:45.814
Back for another free meal?

08:35.797 --> 08:38.100
So, you new in town?

08:39.000 --> 08:40.000
Somewhat.

08:40.067 --> 08:41.168
You know what they say,

08:41.235 --> 08:42.436
it's not a trip
to the Big Apple

08:42.503 --> 08:43.904
without a walking tour
of the city.

08:43.971 --> 08:45.406
Have you ever done one?

08:45.474 --> 08:46.941
They're very well-reviewed,
actually, mine are.

08:47.008 --> 08:48.744
It's a great deal, great offer.

08:48.811 --> 08:50.446
I'm not a guest.

08:50.512 --> 08:53.582
Then, pray tell,
why do you have a suitcase?

08:53.648 --> 08:56.217
I'm here to interview for one
of the temporary positions.

08:57.719 --> 08:58.653
Because of the wedding.

08:59.620 --> 09:00.989
What wedding?

09:01.056 --> 09:03.358
Preeta and Ben.

09:03.425 --> 09:06.462
Ah. As in, like,
the Preeta and Ben?

09:06.527 --> 09:08.663
New York society's
favorite couple.

09:08.729 --> 09:10.065
It's going to be
quite the event.

09:10.132 --> 09:12.767
Huh.

09:12.834 --> 09:14.268
The hotel is hiring?

09:14.335 --> 09:16.137
Yes, but they're
very exclusive.

09:16.204 --> 09:18.806
They certainly wouldn't
hire you.

09:18.873 --> 09:20.008
Mm.

09:21.475 --> 09:23.412
And what did you say
your name was again?

09:24.245 --> 09:25.547
Linda Perrybottom.

09:25.614 --> 09:26.849
Linda Perrybottom,

09:26.916 --> 09:29.318
unfortunately,
you just failed the test.

09:29.384 --> 09:30.351
What?

09:30.418 --> 09:31.852
Your interview
started the minute

09:31.920 --> 09:33.121
that you walked in the door.

09:33.187 --> 09:34.355
I didn't realize, I just...

09:34.422 --> 09:35.989
Employees
of the Royal Gate Hotel

09:36.056 --> 09:38.192
must be accommodating,
masterly,

09:38.258 --> 09:40.329
but above all, Linda,

09:40.396 --> 09:41.430
discreet.

09:41.497 --> 09:43.665
If they're telling
a perfect stranger

09:43.731 --> 09:45.166
the intimate details

09:45.234 --> 09:47.634
of the inner workings of
this hotel's private events,

09:47.701 --> 09:49.336
well, that doesn't
quite cut it now, does it?

09:49.403 --> 09:51.605
- I'd...
- May I see your resume?

09:51.672 --> 09:53.408
- Please?
- Uh...

09:53.475 --> 09:54.810
Yes, of course.

09:54.875 --> 09:56.076
Thank you.

09:57.845 --> 09:59.114
Oh, wow.

09:59.181 --> 10:00.749
Yeah, you've had
a lot of really cool jobs.

10:00.816 --> 10:01.883
Yes, I have.

10:01.950 --> 10:03.518
- The Dorsey?
- Dorsey.

10:03.585 --> 10:05.821
The Armada.

10:05.887 --> 10:07.756
These all are hotels?

10:07.822 --> 10:09.990
Well, none are in New York.
I just moved here from London.

10:10.057 --> 10:11.359
Listen, Linda.

10:11.426 --> 10:12.393
I don't think you're right
for this weekend.

10:12.460 --> 10:13.761
Oh.

10:14.997 --> 10:17.132
We just need someone more...

10:19.335 --> 10:20.268
local.

10:24.272 --> 10:25.474
Well, I understand.

10:26.340 --> 10:27.710
Thank you for the opportunity.

10:37.118 --> 10:38.453
Hi. If I wanted to apply

10:38.519 --> 10:40.254
for a temporary position
for this weekend...

10:40.321 --> 10:41.556
Is this your resume?

10:41.623 --> 10:42.991
- No, it's not.
- Wow, this is impressive.

10:43.057 --> 10:46.527
My only... copy.

10:46.595 --> 10:49.263
Well, you are definitely
gonna get hired.

10:49.330 --> 10:50.733
In fact, I'm gonna
call them right now.

10:50.798 --> 10:51.899
Right now?

10:51.966 --> 10:53.734
Yeah.

10:55.168 --> 10:56.403
- Lola...
- Mm-hmm?

10:56.470 --> 11:00.642
if I wanted to shop for,
say, a jacket...

11:00.709 --> 11:02.777
Uh, yeah, sure.
Just to the left over there.

11:02.844 --> 11:04.313
Thank you so much.

11:04.378 --> 11:06.214
Hi, yeah, we have

11:06.281 --> 11:08.816
a very lovely young lady
down at the front desk.

11:08.883 --> 11:10.451
Uh, she's going to be...

11:34.843 --> 11:36.945
Well, well, well.

11:37.010 --> 11:38.512
Look at what we got here.

11:38.580 --> 11:40.215
You know,
if I wasn't a betting cat,

11:40.281 --> 11:41.482
I'd say Tommy boy here

11:41.548 --> 11:43.018
is trying to break
into the hotel.

11:43.084 --> 11:44.352
That's sure what it looks like.

11:44.418 --> 11:45.787
This here is our alley,
punk!

11:45.854 --> 11:47.355
Which makes this our hotel!

11:47.422 --> 11:48.623
Wait, hold up.

11:48.690 --> 11:50.492
Are you trying
to break into our hotel?

11:50.557 --> 11:52.192
Yo, guys, don't worry about it.

11:52.259 --> 11:53.894
It was a big misunderstanding.

11:53.961 --> 11:55.330
Right, Tom?

11:55.397 --> 11:56.998
Are you laughing at me?

11:57.065 --> 11:59.667
Now, I'm sure you know what
I do to cats that laugh at me.

11:59.734 --> 12:01.703
Come on, boss!
Preach! Preach to him!

12:01.769 --> 12:04.672
Now, I was about to,
if you would shut that grill

12:04.739 --> 12:05.706
and let me handle this.

12:05.773 --> 12:07.109
My bad, boss.

12:07.176 --> 12:08.475
So, are you gonna answer me?

12:10.378 --> 12:12.047
Oh, snap!
It's five-o! Drop and run!

12:12.113 --> 12:14.616
- Oh, no, not again!
- Somebody pick me up,

12:14.682 --> 12:16.484
- I can't run that fast!
- Hey, I'll see you again, Tom!

12:16.551 --> 12:17.585
- Break yourself!
- Hey, get back here!

12:20.088 --> 12:21.356
Phew!

12:30.032 --> 12:31.532
Oh, yeah!

12:47.581 --> 12:48.782
Welcome.

12:48.850 --> 12:49.984
Thank you so much.

12:50.051 --> 12:51.720
- You must be...
- Hi. <i>Buongiorno.</i>

12:51.787 --> 12:54.089
Forester, Kayla.

12:54.156 --> 12:56.758
I'm sorry in advance
about my resume,

12:56.825 --> 12:58.893
but there was
a child downstairs

12:58.960 --> 13:02.163
trying to spit their
Hubba Bubba under a table.

13:02.229 --> 13:04.398
So I tore off a piece.

13:05.566 --> 13:09.137
Good. I'm Terence Mendoza,
Events Manager.

13:09.204 --> 13:11.106
And this is Mr. Henry Dubros.

13:11.172 --> 13:12.273
- Hi.
- A pleasure.

13:12.340 --> 13:13.609
He's our general manager.

13:14.875 --> 13:17.578
And I assume that that's
the aquatics manager?

13:18.979 --> 13:20.547
That's Goldie.

13:20.614 --> 13:22.984
She has no official position
at the hotel. That's a fish.

13:23.051 --> 13:25.387
That's the...

13:25.454 --> 13:28.524
I must say, this is
a very impressive resume.

13:29.191 --> 13:30.191
The Dorsey?

13:30.258 --> 13:32.360
Oh. The Dorsey.

13:32.426 --> 13:33.894
You know, I hate to name names,

13:33.961 --> 13:35.596
but, uh, I will.

13:35.662 --> 13:39.133
You must have known
Mrs. Josephine Pennybaker.

13:39.200 --> 13:41.069
She was my mentor at Cornell.

13:41.134 --> 13:42.369
It's an Ivy League school

13:42.436 --> 13:44.373
founded in 1865
by Mr. Ezra Cornell.

13:44.439 --> 13:45.941
That's where I got my master's.

13:47.175 --> 13:48.343
I'm just sharing.

13:48.409 --> 13:50.978
Of course I know
old Jojo Pennyfoot.

13:51.046 --> 13:52.246
Yeah. What a hoot.

13:52.312 --> 13:53.681
Pennyfoot?

13:53.748 --> 13:55.816
Well, Miss Forester,
we'll cut to the chase.

13:55.883 --> 13:57.219
As I'm sure you know,

13:57.284 --> 13:58.919
we have
a very high-profile event

13:58.986 --> 14:00.454
happening here this weekend.

14:00.522 --> 14:03.023
Of course, I'm very aware
of Ben and Preeta's wedding.

14:03.090 --> 14:05.594
Well, we need to hire additional
staff through the week.

14:05.661 --> 14:08.162
But they must maintain
the level of service

14:08.229 --> 14:09.696
guests of
the Royal Gate expect.

14:09.763 --> 14:11.566
- Nonetheless.
- And I'll be honest,

14:11.633 --> 14:14.302
it's not often we come across
a resume this distinguished.

14:14.369 --> 14:16.303
Excuse me,

14:16.370 --> 14:19.607
but this, this is just
a piece of paper.

14:19.675 --> 14:22.310
If I'm gonna be worthy
of this institution,

14:22.377 --> 14:24.680
you need to see me in...

14:28.383 --> 14:29.484
action.

14:30.884 --> 14:32.687
Are you gonna pick it up
or just leave it there?

14:33.955 --> 14:34.956
Yes, sir.

14:37.225 --> 14:38.359
Put it in the bin.

14:42.229 --> 14:44.065
Terence.

14:44.132 --> 14:44.965
She thought the fish
was the head of the department.

14:45.032 --> 14:46.268
Really?

14:46.335 --> 14:48.134
A fish can't even walk.
It can't even...

14:48.201 --> 14:49.503
Terence.

14:51.739 --> 14:52.639
You're hired.

14:52.706 --> 14:54.408
- Really?
- Yes.

14:54.475 --> 14:57.077
I mean, thank you.

14:57.144 --> 14:58.111
Can you start today?

14:59.247 --> 15:02.250
That's gonna be a tall order.

15:02.316 --> 15:05.286
Mm... Very in demand.

15:05.353 --> 15:07.455
Okay. Yeah, you know what?

15:07.522 --> 15:08.790
I'm gonna pull some strings.

15:08.856 --> 15:10.658
It's difficult,
but, yeah, no problem.

15:10.725 --> 15:11.859
One other thing.

15:11.926 --> 15:13.860
Uh, we will be asking
all temporary staff

15:13.927 --> 15:14.995
to stay at the hotel

15:15.062 --> 15:16.664
through the week
leading up to the wedding.

15:16.730 --> 15:18.499
Uh, just so that we can be
available to guests

15:18.566 --> 15:19.868
at a moment's notice.

15:19.933 --> 15:20.935
Is that something
you'd be comfortable with?

15:22.336 --> 15:24.338
Anything for this hotel.

15:32.345 --> 15:33.715
No, it's better down.

15:33.782 --> 15:37.051
10-4, good buddy.
Breaker, breaker, 1-9.

15:39.653 --> 15:41.588
Go get 'em.

15:41.656 --> 15:44.459
Hair's better up.
It's more professional.

15:45.661 --> 15:47.296
Good morning.

15:48.997 --> 15:50.699
Good morning, sir.

15:52.899 --> 15:55.169
<i>The Royal Gate
opened its doors in 1930</i>

15:55.236 --> 15:57.037
and was declared
a New York City landmark

15:57.104 --> 15:58.706
- by 1962.
- Mm.

15:58.773 --> 16:00.607
It's been through
two major renovations,

16:00.675 --> 16:03.712
yet it remains the beacon
of service excellence.

16:04.946 --> 16:06.913
This place has been host
to four presidents,

16:06.980 --> 16:09.750
three popes, two kings,
one queen,

16:09.817 --> 16:11.452
oh, and Drake.

16:15.056 --> 16:16.624
<i>There are 260 rooms,</i>

16:16.691 --> 16:19.726
<i>104 suites, and 21 floors
of impeccable luxury.</i>

16:19.793 --> 16:22.162
<i>The water pressure
is never below 50 PSI,</i>

16:22.229 --> 16:24.431
<i>and our thread count
is never below 800.</i>

16:25.867 --> 16:27.235
- Button, please.
- Sorry, sir.

16:27.301 --> 16:28.970
The spa is
top-of-the-line,

16:29.036 --> 16:32.172
<i>and our spin instructor won
the Tour de France. Twice.</i>

16:32.239 --> 16:33.874
<i>Right.</i>

16:33.941 --> 16:35.143
<i>This wedding
is the most prestigious event</i>

16:35.210 --> 16:36.377
<i>the Royal Gate has hosted.</i>

16:36.444 --> 16:37.411
And it will be
a perfect success.

16:37.478 --> 16:39.080
It has to be.

16:39.147 --> 16:42.182
The positive press an event
of this magnitude can generate

16:42.249 --> 16:43.684
is invaluable.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.220
Would you stop that, please?

16:45.286 --> 16:46.921
- The... Yeah, sir.
- Okay.

16:46.988 --> 16:49.725
Yes. It's just,
it tends to ride up.

16:52.158 --> 16:53.561
<i>Our wedding menu
is being designed</i>

16:53.628 --> 16:55.296
<i>by our very own Chef Jackie.</i>

16:55.363 --> 16:56.597
<i>He's a rising star,</i>

16:56.663 --> 16:59.133
and whispers are
that Michelin agrees.

16:59.200 --> 17:00.200
Hector!

17:00.268 --> 17:01.469
Hector!

17:01.536 --> 17:03.405
Look alive, people.

17:04.238 --> 17:05.973
Why do you hate me?

17:06.040 --> 17:08.675
Who butchered these onions?
Who?

17:08.742 --> 17:10.912
Oh, I don't know. Francois?

17:10.978 --> 17:13.480
- We should leave.
- You're killing my career!

17:13.548 --> 17:15.717
He's a bit tricky,
but he's an artist.

17:15.782 --> 17:17.050
And we're lucky to have him.

17:17.117 --> 17:19.118
<i>And some people
may see anger, but me?</i>

17:19.185 --> 17:21.923
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.
I see passion.</i>

17:21.990 --> 17:23.191
Do you hear that?

17:23.256 --> 17:24.925
- Hear what?
- Your footsteps.

17:24.992 --> 17:26.560
- Oh.
- Carrara marble.

17:28.496 --> 17:30.064
This is Gavin, our doorman.

17:30.130 --> 17:32.332
Master of small talk.

17:32.399 --> 17:33.834
This is Kayla,
who recently worked

17:33.901 --> 17:36.203
at the Dorsey Hotel in London.

17:36.271 --> 17:37.738
Did she now?

17:37.804 --> 17:39.506
Yes. And she'll be
helping us out this week.

17:39.573 --> 17:42.510
Mm. I'm sure you'll
knock 'em dead, Kayla.

17:44.713 --> 17:45.946
Morning!

17:47.648 --> 17:48.882
That's Joy, the bell girl.

17:48.949 --> 17:50.717
I'm convinced
she was raised by wolves.

17:50.784 --> 17:51.518
- What?
- She's not important.

17:51.586 --> 17:52.620
Okay.

17:52.686 --> 17:54.622
But this glass atrium.

17:54.688 --> 17:56.690
Oh, wow. Now that is something.

17:56.757 --> 17:58.258
It's one of a kind.

17:58.326 --> 18:02.831
I call it the "crowning jewel
of the Royal Gate."

18:06.634 --> 18:08.670
This is Cameron, the barman.

18:08.735 --> 18:12.107
Popping bottles.

18:12.173 --> 18:13.607
Excuse me?

18:13.674 --> 18:16.010
Don't spill any
on your Jordan 5s.

18:16.077 --> 18:17.813
These are actually
retro reissues.

18:18.745 --> 18:21.215
Obviously, it's the lace tips.

18:21.282 --> 18:22.350
- NikeLab?
- Flight Club.

18:22.417 --> 18:23.984
On Broadway.

18:24.051 --> 18:26.687
I'm sorry to interrupt
your riveting TED Talk,

18:26.753 --> 18:28.356
but why are you
pouring champagne

18:28.423 --> 18:29.524
at 11 o'clock in the morning?

18:29.590 --> 18:30.824
I was told to pour two glasses

18:30.890 --> 18:32.994
for the VIPs that just arrived.

18:33.061 --> 18:34.061
They're here?

18:34.128 --> 18:35.529
- Yes, sir.
- Who's here?

18:35.596 --> 18:36.798
The bride and groom.
Come with me.

18:49.676 --> 18:51.012
Wow!

18:51.078 --> 18:52.879
- Isn't it perfect?
- I love it.

18:52.946 --> 18:55.015
Just as much as I did
last week when we visited.

18:55.081 --> 18:57.651
All I care about
in the whole world

18:57.717 --> 18:58.887
is that you're happy.

19:00.888 --> 19:02.122
Think your dad's gonna like it?

19:02.189 --> 19:04.225
You keep asking
what my dad thinks,

19:04.292 --> 19:06.761
I'm gonna send him
on the honeymoon with you.

19:06.828 --> 19:09.230
Clear the way,
coming through.

19:09.296 --> 19:11.665
I sure hope room service
is open all night.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.201
Right, Toots?

19:19.940 --> 19:22.442
Ben, Preeta, welcome back
to the Royal Gate.

19:22.510 --> 19:23.945
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

19:24.012 --> 19:25.846
It's a toast
to your upcoming nuptials.

19:25.913 --> 19:27.949
It's so great to be back here.
Thank you very much.

19:28.015 --> 19:29.450
- Appreciate it.
- Absolutely.

19:29.517 --> 19:30.684
And thank you guys
for everything.

19:30.752 --> 19:32.186
It's great to see you again,
Terence.

19:32.253 --> 19:32.854
- Thank you very much.
- Mouse!

19:34.856 --> 19:36.391
Oh, my God!
Spike, get back here!

19:36.457 --> 19:37.859
- Hey! Hey!
- Oh, my gosh!

19:37.926 --> 19:39.926
Simmer down, boy! Hey!
Get back here!

19:39.994 --> 19:41.794
- I'm so sorry.
- It's no problem.

19:41.861 --> 19:43.163
Sorry.

19:43.231 --> 19:45.766
- A little jumpy, huh?
- Ooh.

19:45.832 --> 19:47.034
I'm sorry,
he's a little animated.

19:47.101 --> 19:48.369
Yeah, um...

19:48.436 --> 19:49.904
Oh, she's so sweet.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.373
Wow, you're really good
with animals.

19:52.439 --> 19:55.609
Toots is usually really shy.
And by "shy," I mean,

19:55.676 --> 19:57.645
she... She scratches
people's faces off.

19:57.712 --> 19:59.747
- Oh.
- Oh. Well...

19:59.813 --> 20:02.248
she can smell
a bona fide animal lover.

20:03.551 --> 20:05.019
You know,
Kayla's new here

20:05.086 --> 20:06.487
and I was just about
to explain to her that, uh...

20:07.856 --> 20:09.791
we traditionally
have a no-pets policy...

20:09.858 --> 20:11.492
- Oh, wow.
- ...but, uh, you know...

20:14.195 --> 20:15.763
I would be delighted
to make an exception.

20:15.830 --> 20:17.497
- Is your hand okay?
- It's fine.

20:17.564 --> 20:18.899
Looks like
your hand's bleeding.

20:18.966 --> 20:20.301
It's fine, it's perfect.
We've prepared a list

20:20.368 --> 20:22.102
of some of the most
prestigious dog parks

20:22.169 --> 20:23.403
in the area, and I think

20:23.471 --> 20:26.474
the one on 11th Street
is particularly luxurious.

20:26.541 --> 20:27.875
But are the people uptight?

20:27.942 --> 20:29.810
Because... I mean,
do they yell at the dogs

20:29.877 --> 20:31.378
for being off-leash?

20:31.445 --> 20:33.548
- Spike, he's... he's... Yeah.
- You can just say it.

20:33.613 --> 20:34.914
- He's disgusting.
- Yeah.

20:34.982 --> 20:36.517
- He's disgusting?
- Huh?

20:36.583 --> 20:37.918
There is one that I know about

20:37.985 --> 20:39.587
that's behind
this falafel place on 17th.

20:39.654 --> 20:40.821
It's not technically
a dog park,

20:40.888 --> 20:42.089
but they let
their dogs off-leash

20:42.156 --> 20:43.389
and they kinda
look out for each other.

20:43.456 --> 20:44.524
It's pretty low-key.

20:44.591 --> 20:45.893
That is amazing.
Thank you, Kayla.

20:45.959 --> 20:48.128
- Thanks, Kayla.
- Yes. Thank you, Kayla.

20:48.196 --> 20:50.430
Of course. Any time.

20:50.497 --> 20:53.600
I just have to say, I follow
you guys on Instagram,

20:53.667 --> 20:56.536
and you are
the cutest couple ever.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.907
And that rock, whoa!

20:58.974 --> 21:00.708
- Yes, well...
- Yeah.

21:02.142 --> 21:04.244
Could see that thing
from outer space. Good job.

21:04.311 --> 21:06.546
You know, you could see
our love from outer space.

21:06.613 --> 21:07.780
Oh.

21:07.848 --> 21:09.116
That was fantastic.

21:09.183 --> 21:10.685
- Great. Thank you.
- Shall we?

21:10.751 --> 21:12.086
- We shall.
- Come on, Tootsie.

21:12.151 --> 21:13.987
Come on, Spike.

21:14.054 --> 21:15.355
But in all seriousness,
is there a safe in the hotel?

21:15.421 --> 21:16.857
It's a giant diamond.

21:16.924 --> 21:18.259
Of course, of course.

21:29.469 --> 21:30.637
How was the ride?

21:30.705 --> 21:31.740
Very good,
thank you very much.

21:36.409 --> 21:38.146
Not... Not to worry.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.181
That's probably
a scream of delight.

21:40.246 --> 21:41.749
You know, someone seeing
their beautiful room

21:41.815 --> 21:43.083
for the first time.
It happens all the time.

21:43.150 --> 21:44.985
Lola? Can you see them
to their room?

21:45.051 --> 21:46.855
- Excuse me.
- Of course.

21:46.920 --> 21:49.256
Leo is shaken to the core.

21:49.323 --> 21:50.757
The mouse

21:50.824 --> 21:53.494
ran right over his foot.

21:53.561 --> 21:55.929
Look, Terence,
I've worked too frigging hard

21:55.996 --> 21:58.331
to be saddled
with a bunch of inept...

21:58.398 --> 22:02.802
Wonderful group of gifted
colleagues to have my career

22:02.869 --> 22:06.674
tossed into a fish bucket
over some infestation.

22:06.741 --> 22:08.743
Jackie,
Jackie, Jackie, Jackie.

22:08.810 --> 22:11.178
I know the gravity
of this situation.

22:11.245 --> 22:13.947
- And I will handle it.
- I'll catch it, sir.

22:15.516 --> 22:17.584
Him. Or her.

22:17.651 --> 22:18.985
It could be a female...

22:19.052 --> 22:21.022
- I'm not gender biased
- No, no.

22:21.089 --> 22:22.923
- and I don't want to go by...
- No, no, it's fine. It's gender-fluid now.

22:22.990 --> 22:26.294
The point is, I will catch
that little mouse,

22:26.360 --> 22:28.528
and I will be
discreet about it.

22:37.871 --> 22:40.841
Okay. I need you to understand

22:40.907 --> 22:42.475
the sensitivity of this matter.

22:42.542 --> 22:45.112
- Yes.
- If a picture of this mouse is tweeted up

22:45.179 --> 22:49.316
to insta-book-face
or the ticky-tock,

22:49.384 --> 22:50.751
we will be ruined.

22:50.818 --> 22:52.920
No, sir. We're not ruined,
because it's not gonna happen.

22:52.986 --> 22:54.854
Okay? So, you guys
clear your heads about it.

22:54.921 --> 22:56.490
That Rodentia is toast.

23:24.251 --> 23:25.887
What are you doing?

23:28.223 --> 23:29.791
Oh, my gosh, you scared me.

23:30.725 --> 23:32.192
I scared you?

23:32.259 --> 23:34.228
You know, you're the one
creeping around like a thief.

23:34.294 --> 23:37.098
I am on a mouse hunt.
Thank you.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.465
Need any help?

23:38.532 --> 23:41.970
What? Because I'm...
I'm... I'm the new girl?

23:44.171 --> 23:46.306
Well, obviously,
you haven't seen my resume.

23:46.372 --> 23:48.975
It clearly states that
I am completely capable

23:49.042 --> 23:51.277
of doing anything
that is required

23:51.344 --> 23:54.347
to do that is needed
to be done here.

23:54.415 --> 23:55.550
Oh, right.

23:55.617 --> 23:58.452
And how hard can it be
to catch a little mouse?

23:58.519 --> 24:00.822
Honestly, I wasn't
expecting you to say yes.

24:00.888 --> 24:02.055
You know, you got that whole

24:02.122 --> 24:03.690
independent vibe thing
going on,

24:03.757 --> 24:05.091
and I don't
normally get involved

24:05.158 --> 24:06.960
with how the new kids
do their jobs. So...

24:07.026 --> 24:08.929
My name, um... My name is

24:08.996 --> 24:10.564
Kayla. Yeah.

24:10.630 --> 24:11.898
My mom calls me Kayla.

24:11.965 --> 24:13.667
Oh, okay, Kayla.

24:13.734 --> 24:17.003
Well, I doubt that mouse
catching is on your resume,

24:17.071 --> 24:18.473
but if you do catch him,

24:18.539 --> 24:20.942
you should come by
for a celebratory beverage.

24:21.009 --> 24:23.844
Well, start popping another
bottle of champagne now,

24:23.910 --> 24:27.849
because any minute now,
he's mine.

24:29.917 --> 24:31.452
He's... One second.

24:34.054 --> 24:35.156
What the...

24:36.890 --> 24:39.060
Did someone leave their...

24:42.429 --> 24:43.330
What is that?

24:44.532 --> 24:46.600
The sign
of a worthy competitor.

25:19.765 --> 25:21.401
Guess who's at the party?

25:22.602 --> 25:25.472
Come on, man.
Have some self-respect.

25:25.539 --> 25:26.540
You are in a dumpster

25:26.607 --> 25:28.743
and Jerry's inside,
safe and warm.

25:28.810 --> 25:30.377
Look at him.

25:30.444 --> 25:32.378
Just scouting the room and
seeing what he can steal next.

25:32.446 --> 25:34.247
Now, who's the cat
and who's the mouse?

25:34.314 --> 25:36.883
Hey, let's get back in there
and smash that mouse up good.

25:36.951 --> 25:39.020
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Tom, my brother,

25:39.087 --> 25:41.689
there's room for both cats
and mice to be happy.

25:41.755 --> 25:44.190
Look, I'm sure if you asked
to share his food...

25:44.257 --> 25:46.593
Share? You're lucky
the kids are watching, okay?

25:46.659 --> 25:48.061
We're cats. Cats take!

25:48.128 --> 25:50.630
Come on, he's just
an innocent little mouse.

25:50.696 --> 25:53.266
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Why're we always arguing?

25:53.333 --> 25:55.068
We shouldn't be fighting,
we look alike.

25:55.135 --> 25:56.637
Why are we doing this?

25:56.703 --> 25:58.339
Look, how about we do
something different this time?

25:58.406 --> 26:00.941
Why don't we let Tom
make up his own mind, okay?

26:01.007 --> 26:03.009
Now, see, that is a good idea.

26:03.076 --> 26:04.479
Tom, I believe in you.

26:06.347 --> 26:08.782
What a sucker.

26:08.849 --> 26:10.385
Now go make me proud, Tom.

26:31.738 --> 26:32.606
Whoa!

27:08.709 --> 27:10.010
Ahhh!

28:01.361 --> 28:03.398
<i>Life, do you hear me?</i>

28:04.231 --> 28:07.667
<i>Give my creation life!</i>

28:31.958 --> 28:33.628
<i>Launch the third swing!</i>

28:46.607 --> 28:48.142
<i>...my creation life!</i>

29:20.975 --> 29:22.275
Go for Lone Wolf.

29:22.341 --> 29:23.811
<i>Who?</i>

29:24.611 --> 29:25.778
It's Kayla, sir.

29:25.846 --> 29:28.015
Just trying on one of
those new code names.

29:28.080 --> 29:29.081
Well, don't.

29:29.148 --> 29:30.350
Have you located the room yet?

29:30.417 --> 29:31.752
I'm continuing
to get noise complaints.

29:31.819 --> 29:33.921
Yes, sir...
Well, no, sir, I haven't yet,

29:33.987 --> 29:35.721
but I'm... I'm on it. Over.

29:35.789 --> 29:37.991
<i>Well, hurry up so you can get
back to finding that mouse.</i>

29:38.058 --> 29:41.094
And please, do not say "over."
This isn't <i>Star Trek.</i>

29:42.463 --> 29:43.965
Takes all the fun
out of walkie-talkies.

29:44.031 --> 29:45.566
I mean, what's the point, then?

29:45.632 --> 29:47.266
<i>I can still hear you.</i>

29:53.139 --> 29:56.910
I have eyes on the target,
sir, and I am moving north...

29:56.977 --> 29:58.411
I'm moving toward the door.

30:07.655 --> 30:08.589
Oh, no.

30:09.357 --> 30:10.458
What did you do?

30:15.596 --> 30:16.497
Who...

30:17.263 --> 30:18.799
Wait a second, I know you.

30:18.866 --> 30:21.468
I know you! You're the cat
from the park with the bike

30:21.534 --> 30:23.236
and you tackled me.

30:23.302 --> 30:24.771
Is this personal?

30:24.838 --> 30:28.709
Is this some form
of revenge sabotage?

30:28.774 --> 30:31.211
What are you... You're trying
to tell me something?

30:32.478 --> 30:34.747
Okay. Two syllables.

30:34.814 --> 30:36.716
One word. Is it a movie?

30:36.783 --> 30:38.319
Is it a cartoon?

30:39.485 --> 30:40.821
What's this? A pig?

30:45.125 --> 30:46.359
A mouse?

30:46.426 --> 30:48.028
A little mouse?

30:48.094 --> 30:49.829
What? He was here, too?

30:49.897 --> 30:52.599
Gosh, I gotta catch
that little disaster.

30:52.666 --> 30:54.402
If I don't,
I'm gonna lose this job.

30:56.169 --> 30:57.237
Wait a second.

30:57.870 --> 30:59.406
You're a cat.

30:59.473 --> 31:02.509
Can't you catch a mouse?
Isn't that in your DNA?

31:05.111 --> 31:05.979
Huh.

31:07.914 --> 31:08.916
You got a name?

31:13.553 --> 31:16.357
That is really well done, Mot.

31:19.192 --> 31:20.527
Tom?

31:20.593 --> 31:22.662
You could be
in a lot of trouble for this.

31:22.728 --> 31:25.131
I mean, just look at this mess.

31:25.198 --> 31:28.735
So, what should we do
about this?

31:28.801 --> 31:30.638
You wanna catch
a mouse together?

31:30.705 --> 31:32.673
There could be
a big reward in it for you.

31:43.250 --> 31:44.584
Sir, I instructed her

31:44.650 --> 31:46.719
to get rid of an animal,
not find another.

31:46.785 --> 31:48.321
Here's how I see it, sir.

31:48.388 --> 31:51.123
We have a mouse problem
at this hotel,

31:51.190 --> 31:53.359
so we could hire
an exterminator

31:53.426 --> 31:56.097
to have him tramp up and down
this whole hotel,

31:56.163 --> 31:59.032
just filling it with his poison

31:59.100 --> 32:00.434
and alerting Ben and Preeta

32:00.501 --> 32:03.436
to the possibility of vermin
at their wedding,

32:03.503 --> 32:06.572
or we could leverage
millions of years

32:06.639 --> 32:08.975
of predatory-prey evolution

32:09.042 --> 32:11.544
and choose a more

32:11.610 --> 32:14.748
subtle and eco-friendly
solution.

32:16.484 --> 32:19.352
That's why I brought on Tom.

32:20.119 --> 32:21.522
You brought on...

32:21.588 --> 32:24.157
She's a temp. She doesn't
even have hiring power.

32:24.225 --> 32:25.658
It's what we did
at the Dorsey, sir.

32:25.725 --> 32:26.760
Really?

32:26.827 --> 32:28.428
That is not what they did
at the Dorsey.

32:28.494 --> 32:30.097
Why don't I ask
Mrs. Pennybaker?

32:30.163 --> 32:31.299
Who...

32:32.165 --> 32:34.167
wouldn't want you to ask

32:34.234 --> 32:35.703
Mrs. Pennybaker
from the Dorsey?

32:35.770 --> 32:37.503
Why don't I call her
right now, huh?

32:37.571 --> 32:39.939
Absolutely not.
No one's calling anyone.

32:40.006 --> 32:42.508
Word gets out that we're
thinking of hiring a cat,

32:42.576 --> 32:44.178
well, the mouse problem
could leak.

32:44.244 --> 32:46.580
And if word gets out that
we're refusing to hire a cat,

32:46.647 --> 32:48.349
PETA will be here
before you can say

32:48.416 --> 32:49.350
"discriminatory practices."

32:49.416 --> 32:50.650
Mm-hmm.

32:50.717 --> 32:52.485
You need to think
outside the box, Terence.

32:53.954 --> 32:54.821
Could he wear a hat?

32:56.423 --> 32:57.391
Excuse me, sir?

32:57.457 --> 32:59.025
Could he wear a jaunty hat?

32:59.092 --> 33:01.094
And, uh, perhaps a name tag?

33:01.161 --> 33:02.328
I think that'd be adorable.

33:02.395 --> 33:03.597
One second.

33:04.764 --> 33:08.068
Sir, you, you can't be serious?
A hat?

33:08.135 --> 33:12.106
As you can see,
he would love to wear a hat.

33:12.171 --> 33:13.906
And a name tag.

33:13.974 --> 33:17.244
Well, then I think this is a
creative and elegant solve, Kayla.

33:17.311 --> 33:19.679
Thank you, sir. As do I.

33:19.746 --> 33:21.448
That'll be all.
Thank you.

33:46.206 --> 33:48.041
You gotta fix your name tag.

33:48.108 --> 33:48.975
There you go.

33:49.909 --> 33:51.077
Yeah.

33:52.178 --> 33:53.346
You look good.

33:53.414 --> 33:54.815
I figured out who you are.

33:57.451 --> 33:58.619
Who am I?

33:58.686 --> 33:59.953
You're one of
those millennials.

34:00.020 --> 34:01.488
that thinks they can get
whatever they want

34:01.554 --> 34:02.455
whenever they want

34:02.523 --> 34:04.124
without working for it,

34:04.190 --> 34:06.159
preferably with free shipping.

34:07.927 --> 34:10.663
Who doesn't
like free shipping?

34:10.730 --> 34:14.833
This is a cutthroat
$200 billion industry.

34:14.902 --> 34:18.438
And I've clawed my way
all the way to the middle.

34:18.505 --> 34:20.107
And I don't intend
on stopping there.

34:20.540 --> 34:21.907
Okay?

34:21.975 --> 34:24.210
You better hope
this little cat plan works.

34:24.277 --> 34:25.844
Because if it doesn't,

34:25.911 --> 34:27.848
I'll make sure you'll never
work in New York City again.

34:29.516 --> 34:32.652
And that goes for you, too,
Tom. Yes, you.

34:32.719 --> 34:34.587
Enjoy it
while it lasts because...

34:40.692 --> 34:41.793
This is just a test, Tom.

34:41.860 --> 34:44.031
Uh-uh.

34:44.096 --> 34:46.197
He doesn't think
that we can do it.

34:46.266 --> 34:48.869
Just like most people I know.

34:48.935 --> 34:52.138
But you and I,
we're different, Tom.

34:52.205 --> 34:53.574
We don't go down easy.

34:54.708 --> 34:56.577
All right,
I'm gonna start in the lobby.

34:58.244 --> 34:59.112
Tom?

35:15.228 --> 35:17.164
Okay. All right. You done?

35:17.230 --> 35:19.232
Ahhh!

35:21.302 --> 35:22.169
Mm?

35:27.607 --> 35:28.774
Listen here, kitty-cat,

35:28.842 --> 35:30.944
I don't like being pounded.
Capiche?

35:31.011 --> 35:33.013
I see you again,
I bash your head in.

35:33.080 --> 35:34.380
Spike, get back here.

35:38.552 --> 35:39.653
Saw you again!

36:11.284 --> 36:12.152
Toots.

36:14.888 --> 36:16.556
There you are, girl.

36:16.623 --> 36:17.657
What were you doing?

36:17.723 --> 36:19.525
I was looking all over for you.

36:19.592 --> 36:20.694
Whew!

36:22.161 --> 36:24.764
Tom, what are you doing
in the lobby?

36:26.232 --> 36:28.467
Oh!

36:28.534 --> 36:31.337
I see you becoming the hunter...

36:31.404 --> 36:33.840
feeling the hunted.

36:35.641 --> 36:38.578
Yeah, there we go.

36:38.645 --> 36:39.947
Tracking the trail.

36:40.013 --> 36:42.882
Yeah, you smell
those little paws. Yep.

36:43.817 --> 36:45.619
My gosh, Tom.

36:45.685 --> 36:48.388
I mean, be the predator. Yeah.

36:48.455 --> 36:50.456
Oh.

36:50.523 --> 36:52.157
Okay, why are you...

36:52.225 --> 36:54.060
You're drawing a...

36:54.127 --> 36:56.297
Look, I...

36:56.362 --> 36:59.565
Oh. Tom, that is
a "wanted dead or alive..."

36:59.632 --> 37:01.533
That is a stick figure
of a mouse

37:01.601 --> 37:02.869
and your Es are backwards.

37:02.935 --> 37:04.337
That's never gonna work.

37:04.404 --> 37:06.206
- You're looking for a mouse?
- Gosh! Hi.

37:07.706 --> 37:09.475
Yes, Joy. Yeah.

37:09.542 --> 37:11.911
Well, have you checked the tiny
little door on the 10th floor?

37:18.051 --> 37:19.918
At first, I thought, "Whoa, Joy, you
became really big. When did that happen?"

37:19.985 --> 37:21.487
But then I saw another door
that was normal sized

37:21.554 --> 37:23.389
and thought, "Okay, so one of
your eyeballs got small."

37:23.456 --> 37:25.157
- But then I blinked a ton
- Yeah.

37:25.225 --> 37:27.293
and realized, "No, Joy,
just this door was really small."

37:27.360 --> 37:29.697
So, I cut up a towel to make tiny
little towels and left them here.

37:30.697 --> 37:32.332
But now they're gone.

37:36.203 --> 37:39.839
Thank you, Joy. You are
a fascinating creature.

37:39.906 --> 37:41.808
Hmm.

37:41.875 --> 37:44.378
Me, fascinating? I like that.

37:52.685 --> 37:54.386
Listen here, punk.

37:54.453 --> 37:55.621
You and I gotta chat...

38:02.096 --> 38:03.496
What?

38:03.563 --> 38:05.065
You want me to grab it?

38:06.266 --> 38:07.267
Thank you.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.703
Oh, wow. This is so detailed.

38:10.770 --> 38:13.107
What kind of
tiny printer or...

38:14.241 --> 38:15.442
And it's scented?

38:15.509 --> 38:16.744
What the...

38:18.377 --> 38:20.580
Listen here, Mr. Mouse.

38:20.647 --> 38:22.116
Oh. Jerry.

38:22.782 --> 38:24.083
I need this job.

38:24.150 --> 38:27.020
So, simply put, this is a hotel

38:27.087 --> 38:29.289
and you're a mouse. So,

38:30.190 --> 38:31.058
you gotta go.

38:32.826 --> 38:34.994
Well, if that's how
you feel about it,

38:35.061 --> 38:38.232
I'll have to introduce you
to my enforcer.

38:53.346 --> 38:55.916
Oh!

38:56.482 --> 38:58.349
Oh, my gosh!

38:58.384 --> 38:59.953
Oh.

39:04.257 --> 39:05.125
No!

39:07.761 --> 39:08.862
Oh.

39:11.831 --> 39:14.501
You do not get to beat up
my enforcer!

39:14.567 --> 39:15.634
Open up the door!

39:15.701 --> 39:16.770
Open up!

39:19.404 --> 39:21.107
Let me in!

39:21.174 --> 39:22.341
- <i>Kayla!</i>
- Argh!

39:22.409 --> 39:25.946
What do you need,
sir?

39:26.013 --> 39:27.681
<i>Meet me in the bridal suite
immediately.</i>

39:27.748 --> 39:28.916
Right away, sir.

39:30.583 --> 39:33.520
You figure out a solution

39:33.587 --> 39:35.956
to get that mouse out of here.

39:49.302 --> 39:51.371
Uh, come on in.

39:52.538 --> 39:53.839
Hey, guys.

39:55.674 --> 39:56.810
Sorry, it's sort of

39:56.875 --> 39:59.211
the wedding situation room
up here.

39:59.279 --> 40:00.179
Wow.

40:00.246 --> 40:01.381
Ah!

40:01.447 --> 40:03.215
Terence, you were right.
This simulator's amazing.

40:03.282 --> 40:05.786
- Ah!
- It really replicates how bad I am at golf.

40:05.851 --> 40:07.319
Oh, I see that.

40:07.386 --> 40:08.921
I haven't seen this many
shanks since I was in prison.

40:08.987 --> 40:10.857
White-collar crime, but, uh...

40:10.924 --> 40:13.126
Baby, do you wanna
maybe take a little break?

40:13.192 --> 40:14.895
Or if you wanna
do something together,

40:14.960 --> 40:17.229
we can go
scuba diving in Tahiti.

40:17.297 --> 40:19.800
We, uh, could go
hang gliding in the Alps.

40:19.866 --> 40:22.869
Or, uh, we could go
to this alien planet

40:22.935 --> 40:24.971
and just sort of,
uh, shoot some aliens.

40:25.038 --> 40:26.873
Kayla, you could
just put those down. Sorry.

40:26.940 --> 40:28.008
- Where? Here?
- Just right behind you.

40:28.074 --> 40:29.542
- Oh, okay.
- Yeah.

40:29.609 --> 40:31.578
Terence, actually, could I
grab that one from you?

40:31.643 --> 40:32.911
Ah, good. It's heavy.

40:32.978 --> 40:34.647
Think this might be it.

40:34.714 --> 40:37.451
Just a little bit of a
surprise for me and the Mrs.

40:37.516 --> 40:39.351
Let's see.

40:39.418 --> 40:41.455
By the way, while I have you,
Terence, um,

40:41.520 --> 40:43.122
- could I ask you a question?
- Absolutely.

40:43.190 --> 40:44.424
What do you think
about elephants?

40:44.491 --> 40:47.159
Um... Elephants.

40:47.226 --> 40:50.596
I think they are majestic
and noble creatures.

40:50.663 --> 40:51.897
No, I mean for the wedding.

40:51.964 --> 40:53.199
Oh, at the wedding?
Real elephants?

40:53.266 --> 40:55.033
Yeah, I sort of thought
it might be fun.

40:55.101 --> 40:57.103
Babe, I never said
that they wouldn't be fun.

40:57.170 --> 40:58.671
Oh...

40:58.737 --> 41:00.873
So, uh, maybe, you know...

41:00.940 --> 41:03.776
Maybe we'll do elephants.
Maybe we do elephants.

41:03.844 --> 41:05.545
Have you, um,

41:05.612 --> 41:08.748
considered maybe
a smaller animal like a...

41:08.815 --> 41:10.483
- like a hamster?
- Hamster?

41:10.549 --> 41:12.185
- Oh. That's cute.
- Yeah.

41:12.252 --> 41:13.587
We were gonna
ride in on it, though.

41:13.654 --> 41:15.322
Can, can you ride a hamster?

41:15.389 --> 41:17.957
Oh, yes. I mean, as long
as you have enough of them,

41:18.023 --> 41:19.225
- you can ride them silly.
- Yes.

41:19.292 --> 41:21.127
Great. Yeah.

41:21.194 --> 41:23.029
Well, that's something
to consider, too.

41:23.096 --> 41:25.431
Babe, if getting elephants
at the wedding

41:25.498 --> 41:26.532
would make you happy...

41:26.600 --> 41:28.835
You being happy
would make me happy.

41:28.900 --> 41:31.370
Aw!

41:31.438 --> 41:32.539
Okay, get the elephants.

41:32.605 --> 41:33.973
All right!
We're gonna get the elephants.

41:34.040 --> 41:35.342
Great! We'll do the elephants!

41:36.976 --> 41:38.311
Boom.

41:38.377 --> 41:41.046
Oh! It's a motorized
skateboard. I love those.

41:41.114 --> 41:43.215
It's got, uh, you know, Wi-Fi.

41:43.282 --> 41:45.851
Why does a skateboard
need Wi-Fi?

41:45.918 --> 41:47.387
Why the fi not?

41:47.453 --> 41:48.888
"Why the fi not?"

41:48.956 --> 41:49.990
See what I'm dealing with?

41:50.056 --> 41:52.192
Oh.

41:52.259 --> 41:53.860
Hello? Hey.

41:53.927 --> 41:56.529
- Yeah, uh, he's right here.
- Who is it?

41:56.596 --> 41:57.496
My dad.

41:57.563 --> 41:58.865
What? Do I look okay?

41:58.931 --> 42:00.067
For a phone call? Yes.

42:00.601 --> 42:01.701
Right.

42:01.768 --> 42:04.637
One second. Phew.

42:04.703 --> 42:05.971
Hello, Mr. Mehta.

42:06.038 --> 42:07.540
You sound like
you look amazing.

42:08.507 --> 42:10.176
Uh-huh?

42:10.243 --> 42:12.011
- If you need anything at all, please don't hesitate to call.
- Yeah.

42:12.078 --> 42:13.979
We'll help you accordingly.

42:14.047 --> 42:16.016
You know what, Terence,

42:16.083 --> 42:17.684
Spike got into some burritos

42:17.750 --> 42:18.850
- earlier and, well...
- Huh?

42:18.918 --> 42:21.488
I was, you know. Do you mind?

42:22.855 --> 42:24.724
Um... Of course.

42:24.790 --> 42:27.493
I'm ready! I'm ready!

42:27.560 --> 42:28.328
Thank you.

42:28.395 --> 42:30.297
Kayla, can you...

42:30.362 --> 42:32.799
Uh, actually,
I would love to keep Kayla

42:32.864 --> 42:34.100
and maybe run through

42:34.167 --> 42:36.469
some bridesmaids-related stuff
with her.

42:36.536 --> 42:38.638
- You know, coordinating colors.
- Sure.

42:38.705 --> 42:40.273
I have a very good eye.

42:40.339 --> 42:42.308
No, that's fine. I'll just
run through it all with Kayla.

42:44.610 --> 42:47.380
Here we go. I got the lead.
I got the lead. Come on.

42:47.447 --> 42:48.915
Very well.

42:51.051 --> 42:52.920
- Of course.
- Thank you, Terence.

43:01.326 --> 43:02.494
- Kayla.
- Yes.

43:02.561 --> 43:05.098
Wow, what a view!

43:05.165 --> 43:07.067
So, what are
your bridesmaids colors?

43:07.132 --> 43:08.301
I lost my ring.

43:08.935 --> 43:10.103
The big one?

43:10.170 --> 43:11.904
Yeah, my big one.
My... My only one.

43:11.971 --> 43:13.273
How?

43:13.339 --> 43:15.241
Well, I was,
I was on my way to the spa,

43:15.308 --> 43:17.277
and Ben had told me
to put it in the safe

43:17.344 --> 43:18.978
because he's always convinced
that I'm gonna lose it.

43:19.045 --> 43:21.114
But you did lose it.

43:21.181 --> 43:22.849
Yeah, I mean, I misplaced it.

43:22.915 --> 43:24.683
I thought first someone
must've taken it, but...

43:24.750 --> 43:28.754
And would you say
that it is still in the spa?

43:28.822 --> 43:30.156
Or the pool.

43:30.223 --> 43:31.858
Or the lounge. I was
all over the place today,

43:31.924 --> 43:34.527
but I don't want Ben to know
that it was ever missing.

43:34.594 --> 43:37.831
Really? I mean,
won't he just be all adorable

43:37.897 --> 43:39.198
and understanding about it?

43:39.264 --> 43:40.333
Babe,
that was a really big ring.

43:40.400 --> 43:42.536
- Ah. Understood.
- Hey.

43:43.036 --> 43:44.104
Hi.

43:44.170 --> 43:45.638
- Hi.
- What did my dad want?

43:45.705 --> 43:47.840
Nothing. He was just, uh,
we were just kinda bonding.

43:47.907 --> 43:49.009
Great.

43:53.813 --> 43:55.248
Uh, where is your ring?

43:56.116 --> 43:56.983
Which ring?

43:57.049 --> 43:58.284
Your engagement ring?

43:58.351 --> 44:01.788
The giant one
that I gave you for love.

44:01.855 --> 44:04.190
Oh, um... I...

44:04.257 --> 44:06.226
Uh, the thing is...

44:06.293 --> 44:09.195
It's a funny story
actually, sir.

44:09.261 --> 44:10.729
I actually took it.

44:10.797 --> 44:11.865
Yes, I did.

44:11.931 --> 44:14.133
- To go get cleaned.
- Oh.

44:14.199 --> 44:16.802
I took it to go get
a scrub-a-dub

44:16.868 --> 44:18.804
and be all shiny
for the wedding.

44:18.871 --> 44:20.438
Bright as bright as a diamond.

44:20.505 --> 44:22.107
Great. That's actually
very thoughtful.

44:22.174 --> 44:23.744
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Kayla.

44:23.810 --> 44:25.145
By the way, we really wanna put

44:25.212 --> 44:26.779
some kind of gratuity
for you on the bill.

44:26.846 --> 44:28.715
Whatever you see fit, sir.

44:28.781 --> 44:30.082
- Thanks.
- Love you, guys.

44:30.148 --> 44:31.217
- Love you.
- In different ways.

44:32.118 --> 44:33.752
Thank you.

44:33.819 --> 44:35.587
Anytime.

44:37.089 --> 44:38.725
Whoop. Excuse me.

44:40.726 --> 44:43.094
Come on, come on, come on.

44:43.161 --> 44:44.429
Stop, stop! Stop!

44:44.496 --> 44:46.331
Ow!

44:46.398 --> 44:48.634
- No, no, no, wait, wait!
- Uh-oh.

44:48.701 --> 44:50.503
- What?
- Here it comes.

44:50.569 --> 44:51.837
Are you okay?

44:51.904 --> 44:53.272
- Oh, yes.
- No, no, no!

44:53.339 --> 44:54.741
Oh, come on!

44:54.806 --> 44:56.676
Stop the beeping! You're
making him self-conscious!

44:56.743 --> 44:58.043
How many burritos

44:58.110 --> 44:59.612
did you eat?

44:59.679 --> 45:00.980
Oh!

45:01.047 --> 45:02.315
I see what you did.

45:02.382 --> 45:03.983
Okay.

45:06.886 --> 45:08.354
I'm scooping the poop, huh?

45:08.420 --> 45:09.989
You saw he did it on purpose...

45:10.056 --> 45:11.523
Let's go!

45:27.007 --> 45:28.541
Joy?

45:28.607 --> 45:29.441
Hey, Kayla,

45:29.507 --> 45:31.677
oh, how's the mouse hunt going?

45:31.744 --> 45:32.779
Oh, it's going.

45:32.846 --> 45:34.114
By the way,
quick question for you.

45:34.181 --> 45:36.516
Say a VIP person lost a ring

45:36.581 --> 45:39.217
and someone wanted
to look for said ring

45:39.284 --> 45:41.520
without raising any eyebrows,

45:41.587 --> 45:43.489
where would you say
that person should look?

45:43.556 --> 45:47.159
Oh, my God, I, I,
I love riddles. Um...

45:47.226 --> 45:49.962
Well, if I were that someone,

45:50.029 --> 45:50.962
ah, but I'm not.

45:51.029 --> 45:52.431
But I could be. Who knows?

45:52.498 --> 45:55.768
One day. One can only dream.

45:55.835 --> 45:57.637
VIP.

45:59.438 --> 46:01.607
Sorry, back to the question.
Um...

46:01.674 --> 46:03.375
It would depend
on the size of the object.

46:03.442 --> 46:07.147
Is it a car? Is it alive?
Could it be a dog?

46:07.214 --> 46:08.547
I lose things all the time.

46:08.614 --> 46:10.448
I lost my baby brother
last week.

46:10.516 --> 46:11.984
Don't tell anyone, please,

46:12.051 --> 46:15.054
because I was like,
"Joey, where are you? Please?"

46:15.121 --> 46:17.389
And then, thank the Lord, he...

46:20.893 --> 46:21.761
Yeah.

48:19.210 --> 48:21.179
Tom! What?

48:21.246 --> 48:22.648
Whoa, whoa, whoa, chill out!

48:22.715 --> 48:24.250
Besides, that is never gonna

48:24.317 --> 48:26.286
keep out
that minuscule sociopath.

48:28.721 --> 48:30.889
What do you mean, he's gone?

48:30.956 --> 48:34.326
Like, like gone-gone?

48:34.393 --> 48:35.829
Are you sure?

48:38.029 --> 48:40.833
Yes! Booyah, Tom! Oh!

48:40.900 --> 48:43.603
<i>♪ More hot milk
for you tonight ♪</i>

48:43.670 --> 48:44.537
Boom!

48:46.973 --> 48:49.141
Mr. Dubros,

48:49.208 --> 48:50.509
I am delighted to inform you

48:50.576 --> 48:53.112
that the job
that we hired Tom for,

48:53.179 --> 48:54.847
- it is completed.
- Oh, wonderful.

48:54.913 --> 48:56.681
Now we just have to figure out
how to let him go

48:56.748 --> 48:58.750
without triggering
an equal employment issue.

48:58.817 --> 49:00.051
Oh.

49:00.118 --> 49:01.486
I should probably look into
severance packages.

49:01.554 --> 49:02.822
- Right.
- Maybe a month of tuna?

49:02.889 --> 49:04.924
- 'Cause he's a cat.
- Mm-hmm.

49:04.991 --> 49:06.693
I think
it's one per family.

49:06.759 --> 49:09.161
And if there's any way to make
sure the guests get these

49:09.228 --> 49:10.462
as soon as they check in...

49:10.529 --> 49:12.464
The bride's taken
quite a shine to you.

49:14.266 --> 49:15.734
I don't know, I mean,

49:15.801 --> 49:17.402
whatever I can do to help
with the wedding craziness.

49:17.469 --> 49:19.038
They seem really stressed out
with it all.

49:19.103 --> 49:20.406
If anything, the ceremony

49:20.473 --> 49:21.873
is the perfect test
for a relationship.

49:21.940 --> 49:24.076
'Cause you can promise
all you want in the vows.

49:24.143 --> 49:25.610
When it comes down to it,

49:25.677 --> 49:27.145
it's how you handle
the pressure of the planning.

49:27.212 --> 49:31.484
Some couples rise to
the challenge and others fall.

49:31.551 --> 49:34.485
Hmm. I should write that down.

49:38.924 --> 49:42.895
So, did Tom tell you
the good news?

49:42.962 --> 49:46.431
The mouse problem
has officially been handled.

49:46.498 --> 49:49.601
Hey! She came, she saw,
she exterminated.

49:49.668 --> 49:51.804
Yeah.

49:52.639 --> 49:54.641
So, how about we celebrate?

49:54.706 --> 49:56.442
Flat club soda coming right up.

49:56.509 --> 49:57.543
Yeah, there we go.

49:57.610 --> 50:00.013
The real wild stuff.

50:03.782 --> 50:06.284
Wow, those little paws
move quick, huh?

50:06.351 --> 50:07.386
You should be his manager.

50:09.253 --> 50:10.889
I mean, sure, why not?

50:10.956 --> 50:12.958
Maybe they'll see
how much I'm killing it

50:13.025 --> 50:16.162
and bring me on permanently
to run everything?

50:16.228 --> 50:19.232
Okay, so somebody thinks
they can skip a few steps.

50:19.299 --> 50:20.367
Mm-mm.

50:21.201 --> 50:22.935
No, it's just...

50:23.002 --> 50:24.603
I mean,
where I came from,

50:24.670 --> 50:26.504
there were
no real opportunities.

50:26.572 --> 50:27.540
Where's that?

50:27.607 --> 50:29.542
A small town in Penn State.

50:29.609 --> 50:30.909
Picture seeing
your whole future

50:30.976 --> 50:32.411
in front of you
and you can't stand it.

50:32.478 --> 50:34.681
That was me, there.

50:34.746 --> 50:37.082
I just wanted to find that
thing that made me feel...

50:37.148 --> 50:38.750
Important?

50:38.817 --> 50:40.386
Yeah.

50:40.453 --> 50:42.487
And New York seemed like the
right place to look for it.

50:42.554 --> 50:44.957
Well, I mean,
I've heard about your resume.

50:45.023 --> 50:47.159
About that...

50:47.226 --> 50:48.560
Hey, come on, don't be shy.

50:48.627 --> 50:50.629
Whatever shot you're
looking for, you deserve.

50:50.696 --> 50:51.964
You know, you're proof

50:52.031 --> 50:53.431
that it takes more than
a fancy resume

50:53.498 --> 50:55.634
to make it big in New York.
Right?

50:55.701 --> 50:57.469
Guilty as charged.

51:02.808 --> 51:05.043
Toots needs
a little pawpicure.

51:05.110 --> 51:07.212
Kayla mentioned
you might have a spot.

51:07.279 --> 51:09.681
We could actually see her right now.

51:09.748 --> 51:12.585

Oh, my gosh.

No, no, no. Stop it.

52:26.891 --> 52:28.360
Why do you have Preeta's ring?

52:28.427 --> 52:30.562
Have you had it
this entire time?

52:30.628 --> 52:33.600
Give it to me.
Now. Drop the ring.

52:36.902 --> 52:38.271
What do you want for it, Jerry?

52:41.139 --> 52:42.241
You wanna stay here?

52:42.306 --> 52:43.575
You little con artist.

52:43.641 --> 52:45.476
Fine. We can discuss this

52:45.543 --> 52:46.744
on my terms.

52:46.811 --> 52:49.348
Okay, no problem!
I got it!

52:49.415 --> 52:50.650
Tom...

52:50.717 --> 52:52.218
- Excuse me!
- Where did he go?

52:52.284 --> 52:54.887
- Excuse me!
- Tom, where did he go?

52:54.953 --> 52:56.788
- Find him. Now.
- Stop. I said, stop!

52:56.855 --> 52:59.124
Stop! Stop!

52:59.192 --> 53:00.592
<i>Calmate!</i>

53:00.659 --> 53:02.028
I'm the boss.

53:06.766 --> 53:08.334
Why do I see temporary
employees socializing

53:08.400 --> 53:10.502
on hotel property
in the middle of their shift?

53:10.569 --> 53:11.770
We were just...

53:11.837 --> 53:13.205
Terence, we're celebrating,
you know?

53:13.272 --> 53:14.840
The, uh, hotel's mouse problem
is taken care of.

53:14.906 --> 53:16.741
Oh, yeah, congratulations.

53:16.808 --> 53:18.009
Teamwork is dream work, right?

53:18.076 --> 53:20.044
Yeah, it's taken care of,
right, Tom?

53:20.112 --> 53:24.784
It is
so taken care of, right, Tom?

53:24.850 --> 53:26.217
What... What is he doing?

53:26.284 --> 53:27.819
He's not doing nothing.

53:27.886 --> 53:29.620
- Why are you acting nervous?
- Huh?

53:29.688 --> 53:30.723
You're acting nervous.

53:30.788 --> 53:32.390
I'm not acting nervous.

53:32.458 --> 53:33.893
No? What's in your pocket?

53:35.293 --> 53:36.295
Ah.

53:36.362 --> 53:37.997
- Oh.
- Terence.

53:38.063 --> 53:39.464
- Wait! No, he's in the pocket.
- Terence, what are you doing?

53:39.531 --> 53:40.665
The mouse
is in the pocket.

53:42.101 --> 53:42.969
Come back here!
Come back here!

53:44.069 --> 53:46.172
Oh!

53:48.773 --> 53:50.342
Oh, I'm so sorry!

53:50.409 --> 53:51.677
Whoa!

53:57.850 --> 53:59.418
Come here, pussycat.

54:06.991 --> 54:08.127
Everyone, keep calm!

54:11.063 --> 54:12.831
Oh, no!

54:14.967 --> 54:15.868
Ooh.

54:24.710 --> 54:26.646
The mouse!

54:32.518 --> 54:34.387
Huh? Whoa!

55:00.846 --> 55:01.914
Oh...

55:03.281 --> 55:05.183
What the...

55:06.085 --> 55:08.720
Oh.

55:14.092 --> 55:16.763
This is definitely your bad.

55:38.717 --> 55:40.586
Kayla,
and what would you call this, huh?

55:40.652 --> 55:41.752
This was a mistake.

55:41.819 --> 55:43.388
It was
a total misunderstanding.

55:43.456 --> 55:45.123
This is a dereliction of duty!

55:45.190 --> 55:47.894
And it's a reflection
of the absence of character!

55:51.163 --> 55:52.697
It's an embarrassment
to the hotel.

55:52.764 --> 55:54.032
And it's an insult to you.

55:54.100 --> 55:55.967
That's how serious
this matter is, sir.

55:56.034 --> 55:57.002
I agree.

55:58.203 --> 56:00.238
Terence,
I'm placing you on leave.

56:00.306 --> 56:01.507
What?

56:01.572 --> 56:03.475
It's clear that the magnitude
of this wedding

56:03.543 --> 56:05.310
has overwhelmed you and you're
in something of a state.

56:05.377 --> 56:07.179
- I think a break would...
- Hold on a sec. Let me make sure

56:07.246 --> 56:08.614
that we're
on the same page here

56:08.681 --> 56:10.749
regarding
the basic facts of this.

56:10.815 --> 56:13.118
The cat
that she forced us to hire

56:13.185 --> 56:16.020
failed to catch the mouse.

56:16.087 --> 56:17.589
Kayla said
she got rid of the mouse.

56:17.656 --> 56:18.757
Isn't that right?

56:19.659 --> 56:21.260
- That is what I said.
- Ah!

56:21.326 --> 56:25.297
That is what you said.
But that is not what you did.

56:25.364 --> 56:29.502
The mouse that caused all that
destruction to our lobby

56:29.567 --> 56:30.701
is still in the hotel.

56:30.768 --> 56:33.104
I saw him
in the animal tornado.

56:33.172 --> 56:36.242
Terence, listen to yourself.
No one saw a mouse.

56:36.308 --> 56:37.375
I saw the mouse.

56:37.442 --> 56:38.743
But they did see you
acting erratically

56:38.810 --> 56:40.212
towards Miss Forester

56:40.279 --> 56:42.179
after bringing the groom's
bulldog into a bar.

56:42.246 --> 56:43.915
She brought the kitty-cat
to the bar, too.

56:43.982 --> 56:46.018
Tom is an employee.

56:46.085 --> 56:47.452
He has a name tag.

56:47.518 --> 56:49.120
This is insane.
I'm going insane right now.

56:49.188 --> 56:50.623
Well, you're certainly
acting insane.

56:50.690 --> 56:52.858
You caused tens of
thousands of dollars of damage

56:52.924 --> 56:54.993
to the hotel,
you've terrified our guests,

56:55.060 --> 56:58.697
and now you're attempting
to frame it as Kayla's fault?

57:00.866 --> 57:02.067
You know what?
You can't do this.

57:02.134 --> 57:04.770
You can't fire
the event manager

57:04.837 --> 57:07.072
in the middle of an event.

57:07.139 --> 57:09.975
Please leave
on your own merits, Terence.

57:10.042 --> 57:11.710
I don't want
to have to call security.

57:11.777 --> 57:12.878
Please don't do this.

57:13.744 --> 57:15.348
Oh.

57:16.581 --> 57:18.016
Okay.

57:18.884 --> 57:20.018
Okay.

57:21.487 --> 57:22.753
Argh!

57:24.522 --> 57:26.158
Oh, my days.

57:27.692 --> 57:29.060
And I'm not picking it up.

57:31.496 --> 57:33.165
Get your tail out of your ears.

57:33.232 --> 57:34.900
It's disgusting.

57:36.735 --> 57:37.903
Well, this is a disaster.

57:37.969 --> 57:39.105
Yeah.

57:39.170 --> 57:40.438
Firing our events manager

57:40.505 --> 57:42.607
before the biggest
and most important event

57:42.674 --> 57:44.409
this hotel has thrown in years.

57:44.476 --> 57:46.645
The only reason
I felt comfortable

57:46.712 --> 57:48.213
asking Terence to take leave

57:48.279 --> 57:49.447
is because we have someone

57:49.514 --> 57:51.482
with your wealth
of experience here.

57:51.549 --> 57:52.884
With the what now?

57:52.951 --> 57:54.285
I got a call from Miss Preeta.

57:54.353 --> 57:56.321
She told me
that you quietly found

57:56.388 --> 57:59.491
a very important missing item
she was looking for.

57:59.558 --> 58:02.161
You're multitalented, Kayla.

58:02.228 --> 58:03.295
Do you think you can handle

58:03.362 --> 58:05.531
the role
of interim event manager?

58:06.831 --> 58:08.034
Are you kidding?

58:08.801 --> 58:09.935
Yes, yes, of course.

58:10.002 --> 58:11.337
It's a massive endeavor.

58:11.404 --> 58:14.440
Sir, "massive endeavor"
is my middle name.

58:15.473 --> 58:16.441
It's Judith,

58:17.174 --> 58:18.377
but you get the point.

58:18.444 --> 58:19.545
I know you're new,

58:19.610 --> 58:21.647
but your employment history
convinces me

58:21.712 --> 58:23.148
you're qualified
to take this on.

58:23.214 --> 58:25.683
And who knows,
if this weekend goes well,

58:25.750 --> 58:29.020
we may be discussing a more
permanent position on Monday.

58:29.087 --> 58:32.757
I can't imagine... anything

58:32.824 --> 58:35.027
that could
possibly mess this up.

58:42.868 --> 58:44.002
Stop it.

58:44.069 --> 58:45.536
You guys gotta stop fighting.

58:45.603 --> 58:47.572
It's like you've been
doing this for years.

58:49.107 --> 58:51.643
Listen, first of all,
thank you for the ring.

58:53.244 --> 58:55.880
Helpful to have it back
after you stole it.

58:55.947 --> 58:57.215
Never mind.

58:57.282 --> 58:58.549
Remember when I said
to the both of you

58:58.616 --> 59:01.152
that letting you stay here
wasn't up to me?

59:01.587 --> 59:02.521
Well,

59:03.855 --> 59:05.323
if you look right there,

59:06.958 --> 59:08.726
I'm in charge now, all right?

59:08.793 --> 59:10.096
And this wedding

59:10.161 --> 59:11.464
it's a huge responsibility.

59:11.529 --> 59:13.098
It's the shot
that I've been waiting for

59:13.165 --> 59:15.100
and I can't screw it up.

59:15.167 --> 59:17.335
So, you two, you gotta go.

59:22.975 --> 59:24.509
Stop looking at me like that.

59:29.714 --> 59:31.482
Ugh! Okay.

59:31.549 --> 59:33.185
Maybe you can stay here.

59:33.819 --> 59:35.554
But not like this.

59:35.619 --> 59:38.056
Uh-uh. That little mess
you caused downstairs,

59:38.123 --> 59:39.390
it's a disaster.

59:39.458 --> 59:41.427
You know what,
you wanna stay, right?

59:43.228 --> 59:45.598
Fine. One condition.

59:45.665 --> 59:50.002
You two have to prove to me
that you can coexist together.

59:50.069 --> 59:52.304
And stay as far away
from here as possible.

59:52.871 --> 59:54.006
Got it?

59:55.007 --> 59:56.041
So, tomorrow,

59:56.107 --> 59:57.341
I'm gonna plan an entire day

59:57.409 --> 59:58.677
for you two to spend together

59:59.712 --> 01:00:01.980
out there, in the Big Apple.

01:00:02.681 --> 01:00:04.449
And if you do this,

01:00:04.516 --> 01:00:05.484
you guys can stay.

01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:08.119
Do we have a deal?

01:00:10.554 --> 01:00:12.123
Your car will be here
at 9:00 a.m.

01:00:12.790 --> 01:00:14.058
Don't be late.

01:01:01.507 --> 01:01:03.275
<i>Okay, guys,
please, everyone...</i>

01:01:03.342 --> 01:01:05.411
Uh...

01:01:05.478 --> 01:01:06.345
Please...

01:01:07.779 --> 01:01:09.581
Any, any true emergencies?

01:01:09.647 --> 01:01:11.216
True emergencies?

01:01:12.618 --> 01:01:14.286
Let's just go around the room
one at a time.

01:01:14.353 --> 01:01:16.154
I just caught
my finger in the door and...

01:01:16.221 --> 01:01:18.357
Okay, please,
seriously, just shut up, please. Uh...

01:01:19.056 --> 01:01:20.958
Madam Kaydra,

01:01:21.025 --> 01:01:22.493
are we sure the mouse is gone?

01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:24.528
Rumors are
the guest list includes

01:01:24.596 --> 01:01:26.898
a Michelin
restaurant inspector,

01:01:26.964 --> 01:01:28.232
so one slip-up

01:01:28.299 --> 01:01:30.969
and me and my son
are out on the streets.

01:01:31.036 --> 01:01:33.205
Jackie, rest assured,

01:01:33.272 --> 01:01:35.373
the mouse is currently
being taken care of.

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:36.907
Anyone else have
any other problems?

01:01:36.975 --> 01:01:39.743
Uh, did you address
the, um, elephant that's here?

01:01:39.810 --> 01:01:41.979
Cameron,

01:01:42.047 --> 01:01:44.182
yes, I addressed
the elephant in the room.

01:01:44.248 --> 01:01:45.216
You weren't here for it.

01:01:45.284 --> 01:01:47.153
Yeah, no, I mean literally.

01:01:58.295 --> 01:01:59.531
Where do you want 'em?

01:01:59.598 --> 01:02:00.898
Um...

01:02:00.964 --> 01:02:02.366
Pardon. The elephants?

01:02:02.433 --> 01:02:03.968
Can't leave 'em in the truck.

01:02:04.036 --> 01:02:06.772
No. That would be inhumane.

01:02:08.773 --> 01:02:12.310
- They can be parked at valet.
- Okay.

01:02:13.911 --> 01:02:15.647
Relax, Cecil.

01:02:42.808 --> 01:02:44.976
Okay. How about we go ahead and put
all the birds in the staff room?

01:02:45.043 --> 01:02:47.346
Um, the animal wrangler
said this time of year

01:02:47.413 --> 01:02:49.482
they need room
to socialize and mate.

01:02:51.715 --> 01:02:53.518
I think they've
socialized enough, Joy.

01:02:53.585 --> 01:02:56.020
This is a wedding after all,
not spring break.

01:02:56.087 --> 01:02:57.154
- Ca-caw!
- So let's just go ahead

01:02:57.221 --> 01:02:58.456
and put 'em in the staff room.

01:02:59.290 --> 01:03:01.058
What...

01:03:01.125 --> 01:03:03.127
What sound do peacocks make?

01:03:03.194 --> 01:03:04.429
- I mean...
- Ca-caw!

01:03:04.496 --> 01:03:05.697
I think that sounds right.

01:04:07.192 --> 01:04:08.860
Kayla, come on already.

01:04:08.927 --> 01:04:12.398
Oh, gosh, I so regret
saying yes to this.

01:04:14.632 --> 01:04:17.101
Pa-pa-pam-pam!

01:04:17.168 --> 01:04:20.906
Oh, my God.
You look incredible.

01:04:20.971 --> 01:04:22.240
Thank you.

01:04:23.442 --> 01:04:25.976
Well, we are
a full-service hotel here.

01:04:26.043 --> 01:04:27.545
Be it dog walking,

01:04:27.612 --> 01:04:31.317
or quite even possibly,
saving someone's lost ring.

01:04:31.715 --> 01:04:32.984
Hmm.

01:04:33.051 --> 01:04:34.319
Is there anything else
I can help you with, milady?

01:04:34.386 --> 01:04:35.654
Oh, no, thank you.

01:04:35.721 --> 01:04:38.090
This wedding
is bonkers enough already.

01:04:38.156 --> 01:04:39.457
Why don't you just say no?

01:04:39.523 --> 01:04:41.226
Oh, no, we've...
We've just decided

01:04:41.293 --> 01:04:43.762
to, um, avoid behaviors

01:04:43.828 --> 01:04:45.663
that might give the impression
that we're fighting.

01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:47.699
But what about
when it's just you two?

01:04:47.766 --> 01:04:49.868
I mean, we disagree, of course,

01:04:49.935 --> 01:04:51.070
about how big

01:04:51.136 --> 01:04:52.771
- the wedding should be.
- Wow.

01:04:52.837 --> 01:04:56.941
But I guess there was so much
pressure to maintain an image

01:04:57.009 --> 01:04:59.612
that somewhere
we forgot how to fight.

01:05:01.112 --> 01:05:02.714
Ben really loves you, Preeta.

01:05:02.781 --> 01:05:05.618
Yeah. He's a really good guy.

01:05:07.319 --> 01:05:09.219
It's just that when he goes,
he goes big.

01:05:09.286 --> 01:05:10.788
And I love that about him.

01:05:10.855 --> 01:05:11.857
Yeah.

01:05:11.924 --> 01:05:14.559
But I have
this feeling that this

01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:18.029
small Indian wedding is gonna
be a great big disaster.

01:05:20.766 --> 01:05:22.634
Beautiful day
at Yankee Stadium.

01:05:22.699 --> 01:05:24.569
Top of the 9th inning, two out,

01:05:24.636 --> 01:05:26.538
and the Yankees up by one.

01:05:26.605 --> 01:05:29.107
Big Alex Gordon at the plate.

01:05:29.172 --> 01:05:31.241
That ball is crushed.

01:05:31.308 --> 01:05:32.744
This might be it.

01:05:34.011 --> 01:05:35.546
The ball game may be over.

01:05:35.614 --> 01:05:38.016
The Yankees
could move on and...

01:05:38.083 --> 01:05:39.952
Oh! What's this?

01:05:40.018 --> 01:05:43.021
A hairy fan has reached over and caught the ball.

01:05:43.087 --> 01:05:45.623
<i>Mayhem
unfolds at Yankee Stadium.</i>

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:47.959
<i>Two baseball fans
seated in right field</i>

01:05:48.025 --> 01:05:49.527
<i>interrupted
what could have been</i>

01:05:49.594 --> 01:05:51.830
<i>the final out for the Yankees.</i>

01:05:51.897 --> 01:05:54.998
<i>The culprits were later
taken away by animal control.</i>

01:05:55.065 --> 01:05:56.301
<i>In other news...</i>

01:06:00.706 --> 01:06:02.508
Oh, my gosh!

01:06:02.574 --> 01:06:03.842
What was...

01:06:05.109 --> 01:06:06.476
Ben, was that a drone?

01:06:06.543 --> 01:06:07.779
Not just any drone.

01:06:07.846 --> 01:06:10.281
That was a CH-4000,
military-grade.

01:06:10.348 --> 01:06:12.116
- Yeah.
- But I'm sure it's harmless.

01:06:13.183 --> 01:06:14.585
Joy?

01:06:14.652 --> 01:06:15.853
- Should I go see what that...
- Yes. Yes, Joy.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.956
- Oh, okay. Going.
- Yes, Joy, go. Yep.

01:06:18.022 --> 01:06:19.156
That was a scream.

01:06:19.223 --> 01:06:20.424
It's harmless.

01:06:20.491 --> 01:06:22.025
Yeah.
Military things usually are.

01:06:23.393 --> 01:06:25.129
I got this drone
because I thought,

01:06:25.197 --> 01:06:27.065
uh, when Preeta and I come into
the wedding on the elephants,

01:06:27.132 --> 01:06:29.768
that the drone
could be kind of, uh...

01:06:29.835 --> 01:06:32.503
As I'm saying the words
"drone" and "elephant,"

01:06:32.571 --> 01:06:34.105
out loud
to another human being,

01:06:34.172 --> 01:06:36.840
I'm wondering, is this, um...

01:06:36.907 --> 01:06:37.775
is this a lot?

01:06:38.543 --> 01:06:40.646
Weddings, Ben,

01:06:40.712 --> 01:06:42.246
they're already
stressful enough,

01:06:42.313 --> 01:06:43.513
- you know?
- Yeah.

01:06:43.581 --> 01:06:44.649
The important part
is that Preeta,

01:06:44.715 --> 01:06:46.384
she can't wait to marry you.

01:06:46.451 --> 01:06:47.586
So, just take it easy,
you know?

01:06:47.652 --> 01:06:49.487
Enjoy the ride.

01:06:49.554 --> 01:06:50.955
- Yeah.
- You only got one shot at it.

01:06:51.022 --> 01:06:53.357
Like, one chance to,
like, get it right.

01:06:53.424 --> 01:06:56.160
Uh-huh. So just go ahead
and pull it back.

01:06:56.228 --> 01:06:59.865
Yeah. Pull it back
and just sorta let it rip.

01:06:59.931 --> 01:07:02.067
Like, really,
just pull it way back

01:07:02.134 --> 01:07:03.368
and just explode out of it.

01:07:03.433 --> 01:07:04.601
That is not what I was

01:07:04.668 --> 01:07:05.770
- trying to say to you.
- Yeah.

01:07:07.105 --> 01:07:08.773
They said they'd
disabled the weapons.

01:07:08.839 --> 01:07:11.409
- There's weapons?
- Uh, I'll make sure.

01:07:11.476 --> 01:07:12.811
I found it.

01:07:12.877 --> 01:07:13.944
I found the...

01:07:14.011 --> 01:07:16.447
Oh, my God!
Help me, help me, help me!

01:07:17.281 --> 01:07:18.417
She found it.

01:07:18.482 --> 01:07:19.751
Don't look it in the eyes, Joy.

01:07:26.324 --> 01:07:27.658
Welcome to your new home,
gentlemen.

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.436
Hey, hey, hey, pipe down!
You already been fed.

01:07:39.071 --> 01:07:40.172
Hello.

01:07:41.239 --> 01:07:42.674
Quiet.

01:07:50.982 --> 01:07:53.785
Get comfortable.
You're gonna be here a while.

01:07:56.020 --> 01:07:57.221
Have a nice stay!

01:07:57.288 --> 01:08:00.357
<i>♪ Alley cats ♪</i>

01:08:00.424 --> 01:08:03.594
<i>♪ Come out and play ♪</i>

01:08:03.661 --> 01:08:05.263
That's that cat
from the alley!

01:08:05.328 --> 01:08:06.764
Well, well, well.

01:08:06.831 --> 01:08:09.000
So, we meet again.
You know, you and me?

01:08:09.067 --> 01:08:11.603
We got some
unfinished business to settle.

01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:12.837
Dinner time.

01:08:12.904 --> 01:08:14.272
Snack is what
I like to call it.

01:08:14.339 --> 01:08:15.840
Relax, you two.

01:08:15.906 --> 01:08:19.176
This won't take long,
as long as you don't fight it.

01:08:19.243 --> 01:08:20.145
Gotcha.

01:08:21.912 --> 01:08:24.015
Oh, don't be scared,
come here!

01:08:24.081 --> 01:08:25.417
Are you gonna eat him?

01:08:25.484 --> 01:08:27.352
Why don't you be a good
little kitty and hand him over

01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:29.053
before I stop being nice?

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.189
Yeah, what are you, like,
friends or something?

01:08:32.255 --> 01:08:34.825
Go ahead. Eat him now.

01:08:34.892 --> 01:08:37.661
If we can't eat him,
you gotta eat him.

01:08:37.728 --> 01:08:39.363
Looks like
a nice snack.

01:08:39.430 --> 01:08:40.932
Chew. Chew.

01:08:40.997 --> 01:08:42.734
- Eat him. Eat. Eat.
- Chew. Chew. Chew.

01:08:42.801 --> 01:08:44.535
- Eat it.
- Chew. Chew.

01:08:44.602 --> 01:08:47.171
Ah, ah,
there you go. Bottoms up!

01:08:47.237 --> 01:08:49.774
- Eat him!
- There you go!

01:08:52.609 --> 01:08:54.212
Is it as good
as it looks?

01:08:54.279 --> 01:08:56.682
What are you waiting for? Chew.

01:08:57.648 --> 01:08:58.816
Chew. Chew.

01:08:58.883 --> 01:09:00.084
Chew. Chew. Chew. Chew.

01:09:00.151 --> 01:09:02.719
If you don't start chewing,
we will.

01:09:02.786 --> 01:09:04.455
Oh, that's spicy.
Cajun.

01:09:04.522 --> 01:09:05.988
Chew. Chew. Chew.

01:09:06.057 --> 01:09:08.026
Wait a minute. Something
ain't right. Open your mouth.

01:09:08.093 --> 01:09:09.493
You heard him,
open your trap!

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:10.661
Hey, cat.

01:09:13.764 --> 01:09:14.999
You got a visitor.

01:09:15.066 --> 01:09:16.533
- What?
- Visitors?

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.667
He didn't even eat him!

01:09:17.734 --> 01:09:19.203
Mouse, you got one, too.

01:09:25.944 --> 01:09:27.011
<i>Hola,</i> Tom.

01:09:29.212 --> 01:09:30.648
How are they treating you?

01:09:30.715 --> 01:09:32.618
This place is, uh, horrible.

01:09:34.018 --> 01:09:34.886
Cheese stick?

01:09:37.621 --> 01:09:38.723
Oh, you don't want it?

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:41.158
Here's the deal.

01:09:41.225 --> 01:09:43.127
I know you wanna
come back to the hotel,

01:09:44.361 --> 01:09:45.796
and I can help you do it.

01:09:45.863 --> 01:09:47.063
As you may already know,

01:09:47.130 --> 01:09:48.933
Kayla's been put
in charge of the wedding.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:50.701
And, yeah, it's a tough job.

01:09:50.767 --> 01:09:52.703
That's why she sent me here
to bring you back.

01:09:52.770 --> 01:09:54.205
So you can help.

01:09:54.270 --> 01:09:55.206
But there's a catch.

01:09:57.276 --> 01:09:59.344
I can only take one of you.

01:09:59.410 --> 01:10:00.746
You know what your friend said?

01:10:01.846 --> 01:10:03.714
That it's your fault.

01:10:03.780 --> 01:10:05.749
Maybe I shouldn't say this,
you know?

01:10:05.816 --> 01:10:08.652
He says you smell like...
Like tuna.

01:10:08.719 --> 01:10:10.755
And a cheesy foot.

01:10:10.821 --> 01:10:12.490
He also said that you're, uh...

01:10:12.557 --> 01:10:14.960
You're emotionally unavailable.

01:10:15.026 --> 01:10:17.227
He also wants
you to stay here and rot.

01:10:17.294 --> 01:10:19.596
Now, you put me
in such a tough position.

01:10:19.664 --> 01:10:21.032
As you already know,

01:10:21.098 --> 01:10:23.133
I can only take one of you
back to the hotel.

01:10:23.200 --> 01:10:24.668
Will it be the cat?

01:10:24.736 --> 01:10:25.971
Or the mouse?

01:10:26.405 --> 01:10:27.438
Okay.

01:10:27.504 --> 01:10:28.772
I've made my decision.

01:10:35.312 --> 01:10:37.047
Check this out.

01:10:37.115 --> 01:10:39.117
In celebrity news,
major commotion at the Royal Gate Hotel

01:10:39.183 --> 01:10:40.851
as New York's elite couple,
Preeta and Ben,

01:10:40.919 --> 01:10:42.820
are tying the knot in
a private, intimate wedding.

01:10:56.601 --> 01:10:58.236
Ah... Ah...

01:10:58.303 --> 01:10:59.738
Ta-da!

01:11:01.106 --> 01:11:02.107
Ta-da!

01:11:02.673 --> 01:11:03.841
Okay.

01:11:03.909 --> 01:11:05.744
No, no. No, no, no.

01:11:08.379 --> 01:11:09.614
Move.

01:11:13.384 --> 01:11:15.020
Mr. Mehta, what do you think?

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:18.255
You're not wearing a turban.

01:11:18.322 --> 01:11:22.125
Is that, Is that a question
or a statement?

01:11:22.192 --> 01:11:24.628
I didn't know
if you wanted an answer.

01:11:24.695 --> 01:11:26.931
I've been getting
really into cricket!

01:11:28.932 --> 01:11:30.101
You're doing great.

01:11:31.570 --> 01:11:32.737
How are we doing
on the champagne?

01:11:32.803 --> 01:11:34.172
We good, we good.

01:11:34.239 --> 01:11:36.074
There's just a lot of it,
and not enough hands.

01:11:36.141 --> 01:11:37.174
Okay.

01:11:37.241 --> 01:11:38.709
All right, bro.
Take these upstairs.

01:11:38.776 --> 01:11:40.011
I'll be up in a minute.
You good?

01:11:40.078 --> 01:11:41.980
Yeah, yeah. I think so.

01:11:42.047 --> 01:11:43.514
<i>Momma bird,
we got a problem here. We need you.</i>

01:11:43.581 --> 01:11:44.581
Okay, on my way.

01:11:58.495 --> 01:12:01.065
- Hmm.
- What?

01:12:01.133 --> 01:12:02.934
I think I might have
just pulled this off.

01:12:04.834 --> 01:12:07.271
Ladies and gentlemen,
the ceremony is about to begin.

01:12:07.338 --> 01:12:10.341
All right, Malcolm,
game face, look impressive.

01:12:10.407 --> 01:12:12.776
FYI, I'm always ready.

01:12:12.843 --> 01:12:14.712
LOL.

01:12:14.779 --> 01:12:16.280
Ben, this feels
so embarrassing.

01:12:16.347 --> 01:12:19.751
Well, if it's any consolation,
you look very beautiful.

01:12:19.817 --> 01:12:22.454
And in a way,
you know, we're the elephants.

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.022
Because we're never
gonna forget this wedding.

01:12:25.089 --> 01:12:26.656
Here we go.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.362
Wow!

01:12:31.428 --> 01:12:32.864
Preeta!

01:12:34.798 --> 01:12:36.234
Wow.

01:12:36.301 --> 01:12:37.901
The, the elephant are normal
in these kind of events?

01:12:37.968 --> 01:12:40.504
We are an elephant-friendly
establishment.

01:12:40.571 --> 01:12:41.940
Friendly establishment.

01:12:48.678 --> 01:12:50.815
Wow.

01:12:50.882 --> 01:12:53.085
That's really beautiful.

01:12:55.186 --> 01:12:57.022
The elephants
were a great choice.

01:13:00.458 --> 01:13:02.828
Welcome back.

01:13:06.731 --> 01:13:09.300
Consider this wedding
a welcome party.

01:13:09.366 --> 01:13:10.735
Just for you.

01:13:12.603 --> 01:13:14.004
Oh, no.

01:13:14.472 --> 01:13:15.773
No.

01:13:16.574 --> 01:13:18.777
What is Jerry doing here?

01:13:19.777 --> 01:13:21.178
Well, that must be awkward.

01:13:21.245 --> 01:13:23.882
With all the horrible things
he said about you.

01:13:23.947 --> 01:13:26.817
That you're not fit
to work at the Royal Gate.

01:13:26.883 --> 01:13:29.886
Tom, come on, now.
Let's not be insensitive.

01:13:29.954 --> 01:13:31.956
Oh, would you just
leave him alone already?

01:13:32.022 --> 01:13:33.257
Well, I got something to say.

01:13:33.324 --> 01:13:34.959
Okay, go ahead and speak, then!

01:13:35.026 --> 01:13:35.994
As I was saying...

01:13:39.731 --> 01:13:41.366
Gotcha!

01:13:41.432 --> 01:13:43.301
Now let's go finish
what we started.

01:13:45.136 --> 01:13:46.937
Have fun.

01:13:57.382 --> 01:13:58.282
Why is Tom here?

01:13:59.584 --> 01:14:00.752
What the...

01:14:00.819 --> 01:14:01.785
I don't see Jerry.
Do you see Jerry?

01:14:01.852 --> 01:14:03.821
Uh, no. I don't.

01:14:03.888 --> 01:14:05.889
- Hi. Hey.
- Hi.

01:14:05.956 --> 01:14:08.058
Isn't this great?
And look, your dad loves it.

01:14:08.124 --> 01:14:09.592
At least,
I think he's loving it.

01:14:09.660 --> 01:14:10.761
It's kinda hard to tell.

01:14:10.828 --> 01:14:12.263
Not bad.

01:14:15.032 --> 01:14:16.868
Ah. Smile for the drone-cam.

01:14:16.935 --> 01:14:18.169
Drone-cam?

01:14:18.236 --> 01:14:20.638
Yeah. They can put
a cam on a drone.

01:14:20.704 --> 01:14:21.972
Wait. Are those peacocks?

01:14:22.039 --> 01:14:23.808
Yeah, I think they might
have just been

01:14:23.874 --> 01:14:26.176
part of the, uh,
exotic bird package.

01:14:32.417 --> 01:14:33.517
And, and even the tiger?

01:14:33.584 --> 01:14:34.985
Well, the tiger is our first.

01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:38.156
I begged you
to stop doing this stuff.

01:14:38.222 --> 01:14:41.458
I'm sorry.
That is the last surprise.

01:14:41.525 --> 01:14:42.527
You just don't listen.

01:14:42.593 --> 01:14:43.995
Listen to what?

01:14:56.173 --> 01:14:57.042
Hmm?

01:15:14.157 --> 01:15:15.125
No, Tom. Don't do it.

01:15:15.192 --> 01:15:17.862
Do it, Tom. Do it.

01:15:26.838 --> 01:15:28.240
You're dead, mouse.

01:15:50.895 --> 01:15:52.630
Yes!

01:16:06.610 --> 01:16:07.945
OMG. Is that a mouse?

01:16:08.012 --> 01:16:11.215
WT...

01:16:11.883 --> 01:16:12.750
Preeta!

01:16:14.585 --> 01:16:15.852
Mouse! Mouse!

01:16:15.919 --> 01:16:18.123
Mouse, mouse, mouse,
mouse, mouse!

01:16:19.223 --> 01:16:20.691
- We got him.
- Oh, my baby!

01:16:20.758 --> 01:16:21.991
No, no. Stay calm, everyone!

01:16:22.058 --> 01:16:23.093
Mouse! Ahh!

01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.861
Mouse! Mouse!

01:16:26.763 --> 01:16:28.532
Mouse! Ah, mouse!

01:16:30.735 --> 01:16:33.071
Ugh. Get off.

01:16:37.307 --> 01:16:38.075
You?

01:16:38.142 --> 01:16:40.710
No. Me.

01:16:47.185 --> 01:16:48.753
Mouse, mouse,
mouse, mouse, mouse!

01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:51.156
Mouse!

01:17:08.204 --> 01:17:09.673
Please remain calm.

01:17:14.411 --> 01:17:16.045
Out of my way!
Out of my way!

01:17:20.084 --> 01:17:22.953
Malcolm!
I'm coming to save you!

01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:24.254
Oh, no!

01:17:24.321 --> 01:17:25.556
Huh? Oh.

01:17:35.499 --> 01:17:36.467
Preeta!

01:17:44.709 --> 01:17:45.643
Out the back door.

01:17:47.011 --> 01:17:49.446
Let's get out of here!

01:17:51.249 --> 01:17:53.251
Oh, no!

01:18:12.236 --> 01:18:14.706
Cecil! Malcolm!

01:18:15.539 --> 01:18:17.574
Stop! Stop!

01:18:27.217 --> 01:18:28.886
What is he doing here?

01:18:28.953 --> 01:18:31.121
Terence is here
because he tried to warn me

01:18:31.188 --> 01:18:33.857
about Kayla, who clearly lied
about who she is.

01:18:33.924 --> 01:18:38.329
No, sir. Uh, this was a misunderstanding.
It was, um...

01:18:42.133 --> 01:18:43.835
No.

01:18:43.901 --> 01:18:46.304
Actually, it wasn't
a misunderstanding.

01:18:48.873 --> 01:18:51.209
Sir, when I came
into your office that day,

01:18:52.343 --> 01:18:54.779
I had stolen
someone else's resume...

01:18:57.181 --> 01:18:58.817
and pretended that it was mine.

01:19:04.221 --> 01:19:06.391
I don't have
any qualifications for this.

01:19:10.061 --> 01:19:12.563
Or for anything, really.

01:19:12.629 --> 01:19:14.531
You not only
destroyed this wedding,

01:19:14.598 --> 01:19:17.768
but may have destroyed
the future of this hotel.

01:19:18.936 --> 01:19:19.804
I'm sorry.

01:19:21.038 --> 01:19:22.806
Perhaps I could salvage this.

01:19:22.873 --> 01:19:23.875
Don't bother.

01:19:27.678 --> 01:19:32.217
I just came here
to inform Mr. Dubros

01:19:33.116 --> 01:19:34.351
that the wedding's off.

01:19:39.923 --> 01:19:40.792
Preeta.

01:19:45.129 --> 01:19:46.197
Oh...

01:20:06.284 --> 01:20:08.152
I guess we were both
in over our heads.

01:20:08.218 --> 01:20:09.786
I...

01:20:14.657 --> 01:20:15.926
Kayla, I don't get
why you just...

01:20:15.993 --> 01:20:17.294
I was gonna tell you, Cameron.

01:20:18.795 --> 01:20:21.766
I was gonna tell
all of you the truth.

01:20:21.831 --> 01:20:24.869
I just wanted to prove to
you all that I deserved this.

01:20:24.935 --> 01:20:26.271
That I could do this.

01:20:31.008 --> 01:20:31.876
I'm sorry.

01:20:58.268 --> 01:21:00.271
And don't even
think about coming back.

01:21:01.871 --> 01:21:03.673
You think I was gonna
let some street animals

01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:05.810
live at the Royal Gate Hotel?

01:21:05.877 --> 01:21:06.744
Oh, no.

01:22:24.954 --> 01:22:26.890
Hey.
Thanks for meeting me.

01:22:26.958 --> 01:22:28.960
I know I wasn't
very convincing yesterday.

01:22:29.026 --> 01:22:32.696
But what I was trying to say
was, I really am sorry.

01:22:32.762 --> 01:22:34.430
I still can't believe
that I saw everything

01:22:34.498 --> 01:22:36.200
that woman accomplished
on her resume,

01:22:36.266 --> 01:22:40.004
and I thought that my pure
ambition was an even swap.

01:22:40.070 --> 01:22:41.138
Come on, Kayla,

01:22:41.204 --> 01:22:42.839
everybody screws up.

01:22:42.905 --> 01:22:44.141
It's just hard.

01:22:44.208 --> 01:22:45.509
I mean, every morning I wake up

01:22:45.575 --> 01:22:46.843
and I look at my phone,

01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:48.378
and my newsfeed
is filled with people

01:22:48.445 --> 01:22:49.912
who are our age,

01:22:49.980 --> 01:22:51.048
you know, they're succeeding
at what they're doing.

01:22:51.115 --> 01:22:52.417
Well, maybe we just need

01:22:52.482 --> 01:22:54.517
to stop comparing ourselves
to everybody

01:22:54.584 --> 01:22:56.253
and just work for it.

01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:57.388
Listen, Kayla,

01:22:57.454 --> 01:22:58.855
you're gonna get the skills.

01:22:58.922 --> 01:23:01.025
You already got the smarts,
you got the funny,

01:23:01.092 --> 01:23:02.726
and you got the love
of helping people.

01:23:02.793 --> 01:23:05.496
Even if I wanted to make
this right, I couldn't.

01:23:05.562 --> 01:23:08.331
Well, maybe they

01:23:08.398 --> 01:23:10.034
can help
convince you otherwise.

01:23:10.101 --> 01:23:11.668
No.

01:23:11.735 --> 01:23:13.004
You two are the last people
that I wanna see right now.

01:23:16.173 --> 01:23:17.041
What is all this?

01:23:18.676 --> 01:23:23.379
I think that's Preeta and Ben.

01:23:23.446 --> 01:23:26.351
All right, you know what? Just cut the
chalkboard act and tell me what's going on.

01:23:28.218 --> 01:23:30.119
Okay, you and Jerry
have an idea for what?

01:23:30.187 --> 01:23:31.089
How did you...

01:23:34.557 --> 01:23:35.491
Elephants?

01:23:35.558 --> 01:23:37.227
Ca-caw!

01:23:37.294 --> 01:23:39.063
And peacocks? A big cake?

01:23:39.129 --> 01:23:41.264
Guys, are you
just making fun of me?

01:23:41.331 --> 01:23:42.833
Oh, so, this is like charades?

01:23:42.900 --> 01:23:43.834
No.

01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:45.502
'Cause he did like a...

01:23:45.569 --> 01:23:48.739
No? All right, never mind.

01:23:48.806 --> 01:23:51.409
I think what they're
trying to tell us

01:23:51.476 --> 01:23:53.044
is that if we go back
to the hotel,

01:23:53.111 --> 01:23:54.445
quickly salvage what we can,

01:23:54.511 --> 01:23:56.480
and we find a last-minute venue

01:23:56.547 --> 01:23:58.181
and some sort
of befitting celebrant,

01:23:58.248 --> 01:24:00.384
we can fix this by putting on
a makeshift wedding.

01:24:02.352 --> 01:24:05.155
And you got
all of that from that?

01:24:05.222 --> 01:24:06.456
Yeah.

01:24:06.523 --> 01:24:08.258
We kinda understand
each other now.

01:24:08.325 --> 01:24:09.258
Let's do it.

01:24:09.325 --> 01:24:10.793
What do we have to lose?

01:24:24.975 --> 01:24:25.843
Hey.

01:24:26.575 --> 01:24:27.645
Where's Preeta going?

01:24:27.710 --> 01:24:29.713
A doorman never tells.

01:24:31.214 --> 01:24:32.181
JFK.

01:24:34.918 --> 01:24:36.954
Okay, guys. I know that
you both don't get along,

01:24:37.020 --> 01:24:39.356
but now it's time
to change that.

01:24:39.423 --> 01:24:42.292
So, help me save this wedding
and go catch that bride, okay?

01:24:42.359 --> 01:24:43.593
And bring her back here.

01:24:49.299 --> 01:24:50.601
What do you want?

01:24:50.667 --> 01:24:51.968
I just need to talk to Ben
for a minute.

01:24:52.035 --> 01:24:53.437
No, don't you think
you've done enough?

01:24:53.504 --> 01:24:55.039
Ben. This wedding
can still happen, today.

01:24:55.106 --> 01:24:57.374
How? I mean,
everything's destroyed.

01:24:57.441 --> 01:24:58.776
It doesn't matter.

01:24:58.843 --> 01:25:01.612
Preeta never actually
wanted any of this.

01:25:01.678 --> 01:25:03.746
She just wanted
you to listen to her.

01:25:03.813 --> 01:25:05.548
I, I don't think so.

01:25:05.615 --> 01:25:07.750
Wait. Someone once told me

01:25:07.817 --> 01:25:10.454
that a wedding
is a couple's very first test.

01:25:10.521 --> 01:25:11.521
And some couples,

01:25:11.588 --> 01:25:13.389
well, they rise to that.

01:25:13.456 --> 01:25:14.490
Stupid.

01:25:14.557 --> 01:25:15.859
What kind of idiot said that?

01:25:15.926 --> 01:25:17.995
- I mean, seriously...
- Me.

01:25:18.529 --> 01:25:19.597
Oh.

01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:21.865
I apologize. I'm sorry.

01:25:21.932 --> 01:25:24.935
I was being, uh, sarcastic.

01:25:25.002 --> 01:25:28.871
You can rise, Ben.
We can still pull this off.

01:25:28.938 --> 01:25:31.609
Needless to say,
everything at this hotel

01:25:31.674 --> 01:25:32.842
will be at your disposal.

01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:35.212
Except, of course, the hotel.

01:25:35.277 --> 01:25:36.446
What about the garden

01:25:36.513 --> 01:25:37.581
across the street?

01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.816
Uh, I'm sorry, garden?

01:25:39.883 --> 01:25:40.717
Mm-hmm.

01:25:40.784 --> 01:25:43.087
Wait, do you mean Central Park?

01:25:43.154 --> 01:25:45.589
Sure. Whatever nickname
you have for it.

01:25:45.655 --> 01:25:48.191
That's actually
an amazing idea.

01:25:48.258 --> 01:25:49.694
Joy, thank you.

01:25:50.561 --> 01:25:51.428
Yeah?

01:25:51.495 --> 01:25:52.496
Yeah.

01:25:52.562 --> 01:25:53.831
Well, how about, Terence,

01:25:53.897 --> 01:25:55.199
you and Ben
get a guest list together,

01:25:55.264 --> 01:25:56.432
and then let everyone know
where to meet us?

01:25:56.499 --> 01:25:57.834
You expect me to assist you

01:25:57.901 --> 01:25:59.803
after what you've done
to this hotel?

01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:01.305
I think we both did some things

01:26:01.371 --> 01:26:03.106
that we regret
to keep our jobs.

01:26:03.173 --> 01:26:05.142
Tom and Jerry
told me what you did.

01:26:06.611 --> 01:26:08.112
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

01:26:08.980 --> 01:26:11.749
Okay, thank you.

01:26:11.815 --> 01:26:14.485
If Tom and Jerry can be
out there working together,

01:26:14.551 --> 01:26:15.652
then so can we.

01:26:27.264 --> 01:26:28.699
<i>Roger, roger, over.</i>

01:26:28.766 --> 01:26:30.333
<i>Come in, Tom and Jerry.</i>

01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:32.503
<i>I know you can't talk,
but I'm sure you can hear me.</i>

01:26:32.569 --> 01:26:34.036
<i>Preeta's on Lexington,</i>

01:26:34.103 --> 01:26:35.972
<i>and it looks like she's headed
for the Midtown Tunnel.</i>

01:27:05.369 --> 01:27:06.969
<i>No, wait, they're actually
making a left turn on 57th.</i>

01:27:07.036 --> 01:27:08.571
<i>They're going for
the Queensboro Bridge.</i>

01:27:16.379 --> 01:27:17.813
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.148
<i>Guys, you have to get them</i>

01:27:19.215 --> 01:27:20.284
<i>before they make it
to the bridge.</i>

01:27:21.218 --> 01:27:22.520
<i>Hello?</i>

01:27:22.585 --> 01:27:24.855
<i>Ugh, this no-talking thing
is really getting old.</i>

01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:30.328
Whoa!

01:28:01.991 --> 01:28:02.859
Toots!

01:28:08.598 --> 01:28:10.165
Stop the car!

01:28:20.410 --> 01:28:21.945
Follow them. Let's go.

01:28:27.985 --> 01:28:28.884
Could you keep up?

01:28:28.951 --> 01:28:30.119
<i>Great job, guys.</i>

01:28:30.187 --> 01:28:31.955
<i>I'm sending you
a new location.</i>

01:28:41.298 --> 01:28:43.067
Toots.

01:28:43.566 --> 01:28:45.101
Come back!

01:29:13.262 --> 01:29:15.598
What...
Kayla, what is going on?

01:29:15.665 --> 01:29:17.066
Hear me out.

01:29:17.133 --> 01:29:21.070
I know
yesterday was a disaster.

01:29:21.137 --> 01:29:24.207
But I promise you
that most of the chaos

01:29:24.275 --> 01:29:25.276
was because of me.

01:29:26.410 --> 01:29:27.378
And them.

01:29:29.045 --> 01:29:32.883
But just like me,
they've changed their ways.

01:29:35.886 --> 01:29:37.521
But, Preeta,

01:29:37.587 --> 01:29:40.124
I really think we have
the chance to make this right.

01:29:48.097 --> 01:29:49.766
Good luck.

01:29:57.441 --> 01:29:58.976
Listen, Preeta, I'm sorry.

01:29:59.043 --> 01:30:01.378
Okay? I wanted to give you
the wedding of your dreams,

01:30:01.444 --> 01:30:03.647
but at some point,
it drifted into my dreams

01:30:03.713 --> 01:30:04.914
and your father's dreams,

01:30:04.981 --> 01:30:06.316
and then your father
was in my dreams,

01:30:06.383 --> 01:30:08.018
and in one of them,
he was riding a tiger.

01:30:08.084 --> 01:30:09.386
It was really weird.
And then...

01:30:11.321 --> 01:30:14.557
I'm sorry that
I didn't just shut up

01:30:14.624 --> 01:30:17.359
and listen to what you wanted.

01:30:17.427 --> 01:30:18.763
What I want is you.

01:30:20.562 --> 01:30:22.065
It's only ever been that.

01:30:24.034 --> 01:30:25.201
Going forward,

01:30:26.736 --> 01:30:29.206
I promise fewer surprises,

01:30:29.938 --> 01:30:31.776
and I promise more truth.

01:30:32.375 --> 01:30:33.276
'Cause honestly,

01:30:34.611 --> 01:30:35.512
I love you.

01:30:37.112 --> 01:30:39.281
Will you please take this back?

01:30:46.222 --> 01:30:49.025
And will you marry me again,
but better this time?

01:31:26.562 --> 01:31:29.098
You know, it wasn't
all Thomas and Jerome.

01:31:29.165 --> 01:31:31.167
I know you had
a hand in it, too.

01:31:31.234 --> 01:31:32.335
You were right
from the beginning.

01:31:32.402 --> 01:31:34.672
A resume
is just a piece of paper.

01:31:34.737 --> 01:31:35.739
You have to give
someone a chance

01:31:35.806 --> 01:31:36.839
to find out what they can do.

01:31:36.906 --> 01:31:38.173
I agree.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.211
Yes, you, um,
did a very good job.

01:31:41.945 --> 01:31:43.914
Thank you, Terence.

01:31:43.981 --> 01:31:47.016
On that note,
I would love to introduce you

01:31:47.083 --> 01:31:48.719
to Miss Linda Perrybottom.

01:31:48.785 --> 01:31:49.819
Mr. Dubros.

01:31:49.886 --> 01:31:51.722
The real owner of the resume.

01:31:51.789 --> 01:31:52.989
Hello.

01:31:53.056 --> 01:31:53.924
You must be Terence.

01:31:53.990 --> 01:31:55.190
Uh, I am.

01:31:55.258 --> 01:31:56.927
Josephine Pennybaker
at the Dorsey

01:31:56.993 --> 01:31:58.527
says the most wonderful things
about you.

01:31:58.594 --> 01:31:59.495
Oh, she does?

01:32:00.931 --> 01:32:02.900
It's quite
an impressive resume.

01:32:03.834 --> 01:32:05.235
Um...

01:32:05.301 --> 01:32:07.437
I guess I'll see you
in my office tomorrow, or,

01:32:07.504 --> 01:32:11.508
um, in Mr. Dubros' office
tomorrow.

01:32:18.414 --> 01:32:19.549
Thank you, Kayla.

01:32:19.616 --> 01:32:21.618
And we'll see you tomorrow.

01:32:21.683 --> 01:32:22.686
Thank you, sir.

01:32:22.752 --> 01:32:24.120
And I won't let you down.

01:32:24.855 --> 01:32:26.522
Good luck, Terence.

01:32:38.935 --> 01:32:43.440
All right, I think we actually
might've pulled this off,

01:32:43.507 --> 01:32:44.208
maybe.

01:32:44.273 --> 01:32:45.942
Oh, definitely.

01:32:47.544 --> 01:32:49.379
- Champagne.
- Mm-hmm.

01:32:49.445 --> 01:32:50.279
Cheers.

01:33:27.215 --> 01:33:29.084
Huh?

01:33:35.825 --> 01:33:37.694
Come here, pussycat.

01:33:37.761 --> 01:33:39.462
You're ruining the whole day.

01:33:39.529 --> 01:33:43.299
I'm gonna
turn you into a biscuit.

01:33:43.365 --> 01:33:45.401
Huh?

01:33:50.106 --> 01:33:51.941
Sorry. Nothing to see here.

01:33:52.008 --> 01:33:53.109
What the...

01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:44.160
<i>Maybach music...</i>

01:40:34.009 --> 01:40:37.547
Uh, Mr. Dubros, I just
got a bill for both weddings.

01:40:37.612 --> 01:40:38.714
That's a joke, right?

01:40:38.780 --> 01:40:40.115
Well, you know, I, uh,

01:40:40.182 --> 01:40:42.819
had Terence run some numbers
earlier and...

01:40:42.886 --> 01:40:44.487
it doesn't look good for you.

01:40:47.757 --> 01:40:49.493
Thank you for choosing
the Royal Gate.
