...there was a girl.

772
00:44:57,830 --> 00:45:01,900
And the girl had...

773
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,840
a sh-adow.

774
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:12,310

tethered together.

776
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,780
When the girl ate,

her food was given to her

778

warm and tasty.

779
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,460
But when the shadow was hungry,

780
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:29,460
she had to eat rabbit,

781
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,230
raw and bloody.

782
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,800
On Christmas,

783
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,670
the girl received
wonderful toys,

784
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,870
soft and cushy.

785
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:47,180
But the shadow's toys
were so sharp and cold,

786
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,280
they'd slice
through her fingers

787
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,850
when she tried
to play with them.

788
00:45:51,850 --> 00:45:56,620
The girl met a handsome prince

789
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:58,620
and fell in love,

790
00:45:58,620 --> 00:46:03,590
but the shadow,
at that same time,

791
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,800
met Abraham.

792
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:10,770
It didn't matter
if she loved him or not.

793
00:46:10,770 --> 00:46:14,870
He was tethered to
the girl's prince, after all.

794
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:20,240
Then the girl had
her first child,

795
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:22,550
a beautiful baby girl.

796

797
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:28,750
she gave birth
to a little monster.

Umbrae was born laughing.

799
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:36,990
The girl had a second child,
a boy this time.

800
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,330
They had to cut her open
and take him from her belly.

801
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:46,540
The shadow had to do it all...

802

herself.

803
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:50,870
