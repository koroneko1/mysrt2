He's a landscape artist.

7
00:00:17,568 --> 00:00:20,151
No one has ever seen his face, though.

8
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,000
You said you didn't love me.
Why do you still keep it?

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,049
I've never not loved you.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,102
Well, well.
Look who's finally calling me.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,908
How are you? Have you got settled yet?

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,074
I'm getting used to the life here.

13
00:00:42,074 --> 00:00:43,620
I even almost got into a fight with kangaroos.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,741
I miss you guys so much.

15
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,590
Oh, you do?

16
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,954
I remember someone said he didn't want to go to Australia

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,284
because there're no friends like us over there.

18
00:00:56,494 --> 00:00:57,444
By the way...

19
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,438
Are you dating someone?

20
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,673
I'm not ready to open my heart to anyone yet.

21
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:07,352
Actually, I have something to tell you.

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,500
At first, Bomb and I wanted to keep it a secret.

23
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,584
But judging from your condition now,

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,284
I think I should tell you.

25
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,395
What is it?

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,846
The thing is...

27
00:01:24,846 --> 00:01:26,481
before you left...

28
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,406
I dropped by Thong's restaurant.

29
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:29,771
And...

30
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:32,011
he told me that...

31
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,152
Hey, Kim.

32
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,176
Why are you here alone?

33
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:38,954
Where is Mek?

34
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,200
I haven't seen you for several days so I haven't got a chance to ask.

35
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,027
On that day...

36
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:50,638
Did you drop him off at the front door?

37
00:01:50,638 --> 00:01:53,910
Or did you go all the way up to his room?

38
00:02:02,216 --> 00:02:03,327
Kim, what's wrong?

39
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,356
Are you okay?

40
00:02:05,356 --> 00:02:06,673
You can tell me.

41
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,200
I don't know if I did the right thing.

42
00:02:14,215 --> 00:02:15,961
I let him go,

43
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:17,529
so he can pursue his dream.

44
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,116
I don't want him to hesitate because of me.

45
00:02:21,692 --> 00:02:23,800
Was it really the right thing to do?

46
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,800
It's okay.

47
00:02:28,155 --> 00:02:30,572
Did I make the right decision?

48
00:02:30,572 --> 00:02:32,046
Easy, Kim.

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,400
I think the reason Kim went to Thong's

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,881
is because he had no one to talk to about this matter.

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,852
If he'd told us,

52
00:02:39,586 --> 00:02:41,090
you would have found out.

53
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,744
If he'd talked to Q,

54
00:02:43,262 --> 00:02:44,765
Dao would have found out.

55
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,800
I feel so bad for him.

56
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,816
Bomb, which company is Kim currently working at?

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,133
Why did you ask that?

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,719
I'm going to go see Kim.

the fact that you never talk to me about anything.

00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,392
Just a pen? You could've just called.

172
00:10:37,392 --> 00:10:38,665
We could get one for you.

173
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,340
I don't see any pen around here.

174
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,108
I should get going.

175
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:42,955
Okay.

176
00:10:42,955 --> 00:10:43,654
Bye.

177
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,231
Next time, you can just come looking for me instead of pens.

178
00:10:49,586 --> 00:10:51,000
Kim!

179
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,630
Mek is so cute, don't you think?

180
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,000
Well, he's kinda so-so.

181
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,000
I did some digging on his background.

182
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,914
He's the son of a resort owner.

183
00:11:03,151 --> 00:11:05,633
Hot. Stylish. Classy.
Basically a whole package.

184
00:11:05,633 --> 00:11:09,019
Anyone who has him as their boyfriend is so lucky!

185
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,683
I guess so.

186
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:12,503
Right?

187
00:11:13,686 --> 00:11:15,000
With that kind of artistic temperament...

188
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,222
I'm sure he's still single.

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,330
And he's probably hard to approach.

190
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,090
I think I might have a chance with him.

191
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,543
Because I'm beautiful.

192
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:26,262
I heard he's dating someone, though.

193
00:11:26,262 --> 00:11:27,005
Huh?!

194
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,000
He's already in a relationship?!

195
00:11:29,497 --> 00:11:30,000
Mm.

196
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,414
Oh my.

197
00:11:32,414 --> 00:11:33,257
You know what...

198
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,868
ever since I started working,

199
00:11:34,868 --> 00:11:39,062
he's the first guy
who's made my heart beat so fast.

200
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,042
Why, oh why?

201
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,994
Why can't you be single?

202
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:46,599
I heard the person he's seeing is cute too.

203
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,808
Say no more!

204
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,086
Guess I'm gonna have to go back and just focus on my work.

205
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,500
The world is so unfair to a pretty girl like me.

206
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,000
Who is his date? Do you know their Instagram account?

207
00:11:57,602 --> 00:11:59,302
I have no idea.

208
00:12:05,127 --> 00:12:08,449
I already bought movie tickets and reserved a table at your favorite restaurant.

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Why did you chase me away like that?

210
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,892
Because I love you.

211
00:12:50,042 --> 00:12:54,960
[We're closed today.
The owner is taking a leave to go crazy in love.]

212
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:08,670
See you later, Bomb.

213
00:13:09,587 --> 00:13:10,987
Where are you going?

214
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:13,987
Well, I have a shoot today.

215
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:15,667
I'm scheduled to do a review video.

216
00:13:16,687 --> 00:13:18,346
But today's our anniversary day.

217
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:20,453
Why did you agree to the job?

218
00:13:22,287 --> 00:13:23,611
You forgot it, didn't you?

219
00:13:25,787 --> 00:13:27,487
I'm sorry, Bomb.

220
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:30,490
I got the dates mixed up.

221
00:13:31,086 --> 00:13:33,372
My work schedule is completely messy.

222
00:13:34,187 --> 00:13:35,333
What should we do then?

223
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:37,524
I already bought movie tickets

224
00:13:37,524 --> 00:13:39,336
and reserved a table at your favorite restaurant.

225
00:13:43,787 --> 00:13:44,620
Well...

226
00:13:44,747 --> 00:13:46,914
I'll just go and finish the shoot real quick then.

227
00:13:47,087 --> 00:13:49,487
I'm sure I can get back in time.

228
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:50,970
Today's a very important day.

229
00:13:51,098 --> 00:13:52,264
I can't miss it.

230
00:13:54,587 --> 00:13:56,587
Please don't be mad at me.

231
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:03,506
I'll come back in time for sure.

232
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:05,987
Don't be mad at me, okay?

233
00:14:12,287 --> 00:14:13,613
I'm not mad.

234
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,402
I just want you to make time for me.

235
00:14:18,887 --> 00:14:19,902
I know.

236
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,313
I won't let it happen again.

237
00:14:23,287 --> 00:14:24,497
I promise!

238
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:31,506
I better get to work now.

239
00:14:49,587 --> 00:14:51,787
"I suspect Bear forgot our anniversary."

240
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:53,217
"Apparently, he agreed to a job today."

241
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:54,387
"What a bummer!"

242
00:14:54,387 --> 00:14:57,087
"If I let him know that I'm upset,
I'll look like a fussy boyfriend."

243
00:14:57,087 --> 00:15:00,380
"When it comes to relationship, it's important that you can accept the bad side of your partner as well."

244
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,487
"Or maybe you can just talk it out with him."

245
00:15:02,987 --> 00:15:03,961
"Agreed."

246
00:15:04,174 --> 00:15:05,200
"Don't be too upset."

247
00:15:11,487 --> 00:15:13,413
Congratulations, Kim!

248
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,638
You have passed your probation.

249
00:15:16,136 --> 00:15:17,594
Really?

250
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:18,636
Yes!

251
00:15:19,787 --> 00:15:22,107
Thank you!

252
00:15:22,107 --> 00:15:22,987
Well done!

253
00:15:22,987 --> 00:15:24,181
You did a great job.

254
00:15:24,181 --> 00:15:26,477
Thanks to you,
Mek has now signed a contract with us.

255
00:15:26,477 --> 00:15:29,287
And our company will handle all of his projects from now.

256
00:15:29,287 --> 00:15:31,027
You did an excellent job, Kim.

257
00:15:31,027 --> 00:15:33,907
Orn, how about we go celebrate today?

258
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:37,845
Well, Boss already gave us his credit card.

259
00:15:38,487 --> 00:15:39,883
What should we eat then?

260
00:15:40,395 --> 00:15:41,395
How about something expensive?

261
00:15:42,928 --> 00:15:44,907
I'm sorry, Kimhan.

262
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:46,715
I'm afraid you can't join us.

263
00:15:47,487 --> 00:15:48,987
Why is that?

264
00:15:49,307 --> 00:15:50,117
Here.

265
00:15:50,787 --> 00:15:52,633
Because you must go...

266
00:15:53,187 --> 00:15:55,294
have a meeting with Mek.

267
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,187
Actually, I was supposed to go.

268
00:15:57,187 --> 00:15:59,887
But he requested you specifically.

269
00:16:00,687 --> 00:16:02,398
Life is so unfair.

270
00:16:03,287 --> 00:16:06,667
Orn, let's get something to eat, shall we?

271
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:09,667
Why didn't he pick me?

272
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:11,723
Have some extra portion for me then.

273
00:16:11,723 --> 00:16:12,987
We won't!

274
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,880
"Kim, make sure not to be late."

275
00:16:34,987 --> 00:16:36,606
Mr. Mek is ready to see you now.

276
00:16:36,606 --> 00:16:37,487
Thank you.

277
00:16:57,487 --> 00:16:58,783
What are you doing, Mek?

278
00:16:59,787 --> 00:17:00,987
You are being so extra getting me here.

279
00:17:02,087 --> 00:17:04,501
You and I haven't got a chance to catch up
about the past two years.

280
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:10,726
There's nothing to talk about.

281
00:17:11,987 --> 00:17:13,667
Stop being so stubborn.

282
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:18,487
Why did you chase me away like that?

283
00:17:19,387 --> 00:17:20,987
Why did you do it?

284
00:17:29,587 --> 00:17:31,118
Because I love you.

285
00:17:35,887 --> 00:17:38,072
I didn't want you to hesitate because of me.

286
00:17:43,487 --> 00:17:45,900
You had the chance to follow your dream.

287
00:17:48,987 --> 00:17:50,987
You should not waste your time hesitating.

288
00:17:51,687 --> 00:17:52,975
Do you remember...

289
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:56,487
you once said that...

290
00:17:57,687 --> 00:17:59,572
when you hesitate about something,

291
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:02,561
that means you care about it?

292
00:18:03,587 --> 00:18:05,487
Kim, you're the only one...

293
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,295
that I've never hesitated to choose.

294
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:13,987
You mean so much to me.

295
00:18:19,887 --> 00:18:21,625
And I love you too.

296
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,305
Mek, can you be my boyfriend?

297
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:38,487
All these years...

298
00:18:39,687 --> 00:18:41,388
I missed you so much.

299
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:43,987
And now...

300
00:18:47,287 --> 00:18:49,187
I don't want lose you ever again.

301
00:18:52,787 --> 00:18:54,154
Please don't leave me anymore.

302
00:18:58,587 --> 00:18:59,670
Stay with me, will you?

303
00:19:10,187 --> 00:19:11,761
I'll never leave you again.

304
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,272
No matter how hard you try to shun me away,

305
00:19:18,387 --> 00:19:20,387
I will never go away from you.

306
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:39,069
Mek.

307
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:41,847
Would you like to live together with me?

308
00:19:44,487 --> 00:19:46,487
I don't want to have the fence between us any longer.

309
00:19:53,487 --> 00:19:55,787
I, too, don't want anything

310
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:57,787
to come between us again.

311
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:22,664
Mek!

312
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:24,864
What are you doing?

313
00:20:34,587 --> 00:20:36,310
Why do you have to be so extra?

314
00:20:39,787 --> 00:20:41,787
Since I am going to be your boyfriend,

315
00:20:41,787 --> 00:20:43,403
I need to be a little bit extra.

316
00:20:45,587 --> 00:20:46,561
Let's go.

317
00:20:53,987 --> 00:20:55,987
Thank you so much for having us.

318
00:20:55,987 --> 00:20:57,987
So you'll send the footage to me later?

319
00:20:57,987 --> 00:20:59,987
I need to forward it to our editor.

320
00:21:00,493 --> 00:21:01,166
Yes.

321
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:03,300
I'll upload the footage for you ASAP.

322
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:04,749
Thank you so much.

323
00:21:13,329 --> 00:21:14,310
Long day, huh?

324
00:21:14,827 --> 00:21:16,419
I could hear you sigh all the way from there.

325
00:21:19,287 --> 00:21:20,306
It's nothing.

326
00:21:21,287 --> 00:21:23,031
I just felt that...

327
00:21:23,587 --> 00:21:25,287
what I did...

328
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:27,705
may not get dad's approval.

329
00:21:28,174 --> 00:21:29,551
You have to take a shot.

330
00:21:31,187 --> 00:21:34,286
When you put your heart into something,
it can never go to waste.

331
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,703
I'll help during the editing process.

332
00:21:38,787 --> 00:21:40,680
I'll check if there's any more image...

333
00:21:41,487 --> 00:21:42,975
or information to be added.

334
00:21:46,987 --> 00:21:47,933
Okay.

335
00:21:51,487 --> 00:21:53,167
Keep your chin up.

336
00:21:54,387 --> 00:21:56,231
You've been doing well with your channel.

337
00:21:56,487 --> 00:21:58,487
You are not going to fail with this hotel content, I'm sure.

338
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:02,582
This time, I have to prove myself to my dad.

339
00:22:04,487 --> 00:22:06,615
That's why I'm not feeling so confident.

340
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:14,852
You've done a great job so far.

341
00:22:15,487 --> 00:22:16,826
And this content...

342
00:22:17,887 --> 00:22:19,652
is based on the thing that's very personal to you.

343
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,497
You've grown up with it.

344
00:22:22,987 --> 00:22:24,710
There's no way it can go wrong.

345
00:22:25,487 --> 00:22:26,925
Whenever you feel like giving up,

346
00:22:27,906 --> 00:22:29,171
just look at me.

347
00:22:29,987 --> 00:22:31,113
I'm always here.

348
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:35,485
Indeed you are.

349
00:22:40,487 --> 00:22:42,487
You're feeling better now, yes?

350
00:22:43,387 --> 00:22:44,506
Not yet, actually.

351
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:50,882
Satisfied now?

352
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:53,738
Are you hungry?

353
00:22:53,827 --> 00:22:55,225
How about we grab something to eat first

354
00:22:55,887 --> 00:22:57,587
so you can take a shower right away
when we get home?

355
00:22:59,387 --> 00:23:00,245
Sounds good.

356
00:23:00,394 --> 00:23:01,337
Let's grab something to eat.

357
00:23:05,687 --> 00:23:07,346
We're already closed, Mr. Tim.

358
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:09,906
Oh.

359
00:23:11,187 --> 00:23:12,874
But you're not usually closed at this hour.

360
00:23:12,874 --> 00:23:14,426
We sincerely apologize.

361
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:16,808
A guest has rented out the whole place
to surprise his boyfriend.

362
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:18,330
He's over there.

363
00:23:29,687 --> 00:23:30,847
Would you like to go say hi?

364
00:23:32,187 --> 00:23:33,006
Nah.

365
00:23:34,315 --> 00:23:35,838
I'll just let them have a good time.

366
00:23:36,904 --> 00:23:37,699
Look at them.

367
00:23:38,787 --> 00:23:40,134
They are smiling from ear to ear.

368
00:23:43,687 --> 00:23:46,515
What kind of hotel owner can't get into his own property?

369
00:23:48,287 --> 00:23:49,498
Are you hungry much?

370
00:23:52,187 --> 00:23:53,291
Yeah, a little.

371
00:23:53,888 --> 00:23:56,547
I can just eat at our condo.

372
00:23:57,987 --> 00:23:59,252
But I'm not talking about food.

373
00:24:02,687 --> 00:24:04,018
You're unbelievable!

374
00:24:06,787 --> 00:24:08,254
Where are you going?

375
00:24:16,869 --> 00:24:20,679
So you two walked in here hand-in-hand
to ask for my permission to move in together?

376
00:24:21,551 --> 00:24:23,928
Our houses are not close enough for you?

377
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:18,211
"Hello, Bomb."

378
00:25:18,521 --> 00:25:19,878
"I'm at the restaurant."

379
00:25:20,168 --> 00:25:21,255
"Why is it closed?"

380
00:25:21,255 --> 00:25:22,302
Bear.

381
00:25:23,368 --> 00:25:25,036
Our reservation was at 8pm.

382
00:25:25,668 --> 00:25:27,247
It's almost midnight now.

383
00:25:28,868 --> 00:25:30,912
The restaurant is closed at 10pm.

384
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:34,868
I was waiting for you for two hours

385
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:37,868
until the staff asked me to leave.

386
00:25:38,268 --> 00:25:39,825
"Where are you now?"

387
00:25:40,268 --> 00:25:41,471
"I'll come pick you up."

388
00:25:43,167 --> 00:25:44,340
I'm home now.

389
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,912
"I'm so sorry, Bomb."

390
00:25:46,368 --> 00:25:47,690
"I'll be there in a minute."

391
00:25:48,044 --> 00:25:49,322
You don't have to.

392
00:25:50,668 --> 00:25:52,337
I know you've had a long day.

393
00:25:53,868 --> 00:25:54,938
I understand.

394
00:25:55,868 --> 00:25:56,805
I have to go now.

395
00:26:07,283 --> 00:26:10,757
[We're closed today.
The owner is taking a leave to go crazy in love.]

396
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:53,495
I...

397
00:27:53,495 --> 00:27:54,742
I'm sorry, Bomb.

398
00:27:56,968 --> 00:27:58,148
It's okay.

399
00:28:43,668 --> 00:28:44,893
What is this?

400
00:28:45,868 --> 00:28:49,001
So you two walked in here hand-in-hand
to ask for my permission to move in together?

401
00:28:49,768 --> 00:28:52,168
Our houses are not close enough for you?

402
00:28:52,768 --> 00:28:53,519
You see?

403
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,768
I'm sharing things with you here, mom.

404
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:57,303
I didn't want to do this behind your back.

405
00:28:57,968 --> 00:29:00,433
Where are you two gonna live?
Are you sure you can take care of each other?

406
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:01,812
How can I be sure that you will be okay?

407
00:29:02,168 --> 00:29:03,428
You don't have to worry, ma'am.

408
00:29:03,561 --> 00:29:04,611
When you were away,

409
00:29:04,611 --> 00:29:07,156
I always took care of Kim.

410
00:29:14,268 --> 00:29:15,348
Now I remember.

411
00:29:15,703 --> 00:29:19,368
Q did tell me about
how you two were a BL couple.

412
00:29:20,268 --> 00:29:21,627
So you're that guy?

413
00:29:21,738 --> 00:29:22,853
Now I get it.

414
00:29:23,268 --> 00:29:25,590
I saw your picture on the t-shirt I washed.

415
00:29:25,968 --> 00:29:27,691
Yes, that was me.

416
00:29:28,068 --> 00:29:29,846
I've been courting your son for a while.

417
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:33,414
So...

418
00:29:34,235 --> 00:29:35,628
Are you going to let me live with him?

419
00:29:35,628 --> 00:29:37,368
It's no different from living in a dorm.

420
00:29:37,668 --> 00:29:39,368
Please, please, please.

421
00:29:40,668 --> 00:29:41,837
Please, mom.

422
00:29:41,837 --> 00:29:42,641
Please.

423
00:29:43,704 --> 00:29:44,790
Please.

424
00:29:44,868 --> 00:29:45,849
Kim.

425
00:29:48,168 --> 00:29:50,080
You used to tell me...

426
00:29:50,368 --> 00:29:52,868
about how you and dad ran away together, remember?

427
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:55,400
You were around my age now, weren't you?

428
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:56,867
It's time for me to do that too.

429
00:29:57,168 --> 00:29:58,120
You really are something!

430
00:29:58,120 --> 00:29:59,657
Who taught you bring up my past?

431
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:04,940
Since you are begging me this hard,

432
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:07,670
if I don't allow it, I suppose you'll end up running away together.

433
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,502
Look!

434
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:10,768
Someone's already prepared his luggages.

435
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:11,664
Why don't you just leave already?

436
00:30:11,664 --> 00:30:12,388
Can I really?

437
00:30:13,141 --> 00:30:15,141
I'm kidding.

438
00:30:15,495 --> 00:30:16,333
Go.

439
00:30:16,468 --> 00:30:18,069
Enjoy your life together.

440
00:30:19,468 --> 00:30:21,205
Mek, please take care of Kim for me.

441
00:30:21,205 --> 00:30:22,530
Take good care of Kim.

442
00:30:22,968 --> 00:30:23,868
Sure I will.

443
00:30:26,476 --> 00:30:28,200
Thank you so much, mom.

444
00:30:29,551 --> 00:30:30,373
I'll see you later.

445
00:30:38,068 --> 00:30:39,425
That's a lot of stuff over there.

446
00:30:39,735 --> 00:30:40,960
Are you going to live there forever?

447
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,345
Well...

448
00:30:43,345 --> 00:30:45,026
I'll call you when I get there.

449
00:30:51,068 --> 00:30:53,213
Bear, can you go see who's at the door?

450
00:30:57,468 --> 00:30:58,383
Bear.

451
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:13,708
"Please, read this."

452
00:31:24,868 --> 00:31:26,868
"I have nothing to say except 'I'm sorry'."

453
00:31:30,868 --> 00:31:35,548
"I'm sorry for keeping you waiting."

454
00:31:38,045 --> 00:31:40,067
"I'm sorry for being negligent."

455
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,178
"I'm sorry for making you sad."

456
00:31:46,868 --> 00:31:50,884
"And I'm sorry for being too cute."

457
00:31:55,045 --> 00:31:58,045
"Yay! You're finally smiling.
I'm the one who makes you smile, right?"

458
00:32:01,134 --> 00:32:06,327
"But I can smile because of my fans."

459
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,868
"And there's one particular fan
whom I want to dedicate myself to."

460
00:32:15,868 --> 00:32:21,748
"Because this fan lights up my soul each and every day."

461
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:28,112
"Do you want to know who this fan is?"

462
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,912
"It's this one."

463
00:33:08,979 --> 00:33:10,846
You're always important to me, Bomb.

464
00:33:11,767 --> 00:33:12,880
I am sorry

465
00:33:13,568 --> 00:33:15,569
that I let my work ruin things for us.

466
00:33:16,668 --> 00:33:18,048
I will improve myself.

467
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:21,568
I will foster a better work-life balance.

468
00:33:23,368 --> 00:33:24,646
Can you forgive me, Bomb?

469
00:33:27,868 --> 00:33:28,703
Mm.

470
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:40,868
"Papa Bear has just asked me to forgive him. So cute!"

471
00:33:41,468 --> 00:33:43,868
"I'm happy that you two finally made up."

472
00:33:43,868 --> 00:33:46,568
"By the way, Park and I will buy a house together."

473
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:47,868
"Really?"

474
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:51,165
"You two have been together for so long.
This is the right time."

475
00:33:51,165 --> 00:33:52,368
"Anyway, I have something to tell you guys."

476
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:53,384
"I'm excited."

477
00:33:53,968 --> 00:33:55,792
"Mek and I are official now."

478
00:33:55,882 --> 00:33:56,704
"Also..."

479
00:33:56,704 --> 00:33:58,015
"We've moved in together."

480
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,890
How about we have green curry as usual?

481
00:34:15,868 --> 00:34:17,203
That sounds great.

482
00:34:18,068 --> 00:34:19,192
But this time...

483
00:34:19,502 --> 00:34:20,734
you don't have to do anything.

484
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:22,428
I'll take care of it.

485
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:23,468
I can do it.

486
00:34:24,568 --> 00:34:25,788
It's okay.

487
00:34:26,142 --> 00:34:28,022
Just sit and wait.

488
00:34:42,568 --> 00:34:43,663
It's okay.

489
00:34:43,995 --> 00:34:44,890
I can do it.

490
00:34:51,868 --> 00:34:53,004
It's done.

491
00:34:57,168 --> 00:34:58,151
Careful, it's hot.

492
00:35:10,957 --> 00:35:12,226
Is it that bad?

493
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,348
You're scaring me.

494
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:16,960
How is Somchai today?

495
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:19,377
He doesn't look so fresh.

496
00:35:19,377 --> 00:35:20,868
Mek, what are you doing?

497
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:22,403
Mek, stop it!

498
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,668
Mek!

499
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:24,478
Enough!

500
00:35:25,868 --> 00:35:27,425
Give it to me.

501
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:28,162
Why would I?

502
00:35:28,162 --> 00:35:29,298
Let me have it.

503
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:32,590
Give me.

504
00:35:33,476 --> 00:35:35,828
Don't try to hide!

505
00:35:38,868 --> 00:35:40,359
You're the cutest.

506
00:37:09,868 --> 00:37:11,868
Oh, my God!

507
00:37:14,394 --> 00:37:15,625
Seriously?

508
00:37:29,868 --> 00:37:31,026
I have a question.

509
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:34,148
How did you guys become Thunderous Sky?

510
00:37:35,368 --> 00:37:39,156
Now, it's time for the grooms...

511
00:37:39,768 --> 00:37:41,508
to exchange heir vows.

512
00:38:08,484 --> 00:38:09,534
Seriously?

513
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:12,444
Even in the office's elevator?

514
00:38:12,584 --> 00:38:13,970
Can you please stop it?

515
00:38:14,165 --> 00:38:15,544
You're acting like a kid.

516
00:38:15,784 --> 00:38:18,179
Look who's talking.

517
00:38:18,984 --> 00:38:20,384
My friend has really changed.

518
00:38:20,384 --> 00:38:21,984
Starting from Mek of Thunderous Sky...

519
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:24,901
now he's Meka, the landscape artist.

520
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:27,894
Now that you brought that up,
I do miss the old days.

521
00:38:28,284 --> 00:38:29,649
We sure were a piece of work.

522
00:38:30,039 --> 00:38:31,509
It's been almost 7 years now, right?

523
00:38:32,484 --> 00:38:34,484
Do you think there are any Hailstones left?

524
00:38:35,584 --> 00:38:36,264
Why?

525
00:38:36,264 --> 00:38:38,636
Are you saying that you miss the fans?

526
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,484
It just occurred to me.

527
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,484
I wonder how they are now.

528
00:38:43,384 --> 00:38:44,142
Park.

529
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:46,364
When is your wedding?

530
00:38:46,364 --> 00:38:47,474
Next month.

531
00:38:47,984 --> 00:38:49,364
I only invite close friends.

532
00:38:49,784 --> 00:38:50,371
Park.

533
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,566
Do let me know if you need any help.

534
00:38:53,684 --> 00:38:57,522
Right. I asked you because I want to help.

535
00:39:01,484 --> 00:39:06,484
[Absolute Tim  channel is still going strong as Tim steps in to run his family's hotel business.

536
00:39:08,184 --> 00:39:09,984
The food is served!

537
00:39:11,084 --> 00:39:12,117
Looks yummy.

538
00:39:17,384 --> 00:39:19,084
I made the dish myself.

539
00:39:19,084 --> 00:39:21,236
It was a practice so I can cook for you in the future.

540
00:39:22,184 --> 00:39:24,184
So you'll no longer have to buy takeaways.

541
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:31,384
I think you and Park should become relationship coaches.

542
00:39:31,684 --> 00:39:33,684
You've been together for so long

543
00:39:33,684 --> 00:39:35,337
but things between you two still look fresh as ever.

544
00:39:36,184 --> 00:39:37,644
Or perhaps you should write a book about it.

545
00:39:38,884 --> 00:39:40,484
You're exaggerating.

546
00:39:40,484 --> 00:39:41,856
Not at all!

547
00:39:44,884 --> 00:39:46,284
Can I take your order?

548
00:39:48,084 --> 00:39:49,824
Enjoy, guys.
This meal is on Lee.

549
00:39:51,484 --> 00:39:52,716
Cheers!

550
00:39:54,038 --> 00:39:55,134
Cheers!

551
00:40:00,784 --> 00:40:01,964
I have a question.

552
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:05,042
How did you guys become Thunderous Sky?

553
00:40:10,614 --> 00:40:12,984
Hello, I'm Mek of Thunderous Sky channel.

554
00:40:12,984 --> 00:40:15,984
I'll take you guys to meet my new friends.

555
00:40:25,384 --> 00:40:28,579
Hello. What's your name?
Where are you from? Please introduce yourself to my viewers.

556
00:40:28,984 --> 00:40:31,136
I'm Bear. Freshman. Comm Arts.

557
00:40:31,484 --> 00:40:32,991
I'm a fan of Thunderous Sky channel.

558
00:40:33,229 --> 00:40:34,322
Really?

559
00:40:34,484 --> 00:40:37,149
Now you're my first university friend.

560
00:40:37,984 --> 00:40:40,364
Nice to meet you, Bear!

561
00:40:40,364 --> 00:40:41,924
Nice to meet you, Mek.

562
00:40:42,584 --> 00:40:44,267
Do you really like my channel?

563
00:40:44,484 --> 00:40:45,284
Yeah!

564
00:40:45,284 --> 00:40:46,068
How about this?

565
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:48,484
Since you enjoy my channel,

566
00:40:48,884 --> 00:40:50,307
why don't you join me?

567
00:40:50,784 --> 00:40:52,395
Really? Can I?

568
00:40:52,395 --> 00:40:53,307
Of course.

569
00:40:53,307 --> 00:40:54,224
But...

570
00:40:54,571 --> 00:40:56,484
You must pass the test first.

571
00:40:56,484 --> 00:40:59,087
You have to come up with one prank content.

572
00:40:59,184 --> 00:41:00,594
Sure, my friend!

573
00:41:04,984 --> 00:41:06,529
You look like a real ghost.

574
00:41:06,529 --> 00:41:09,484
Anyone who sees you would be so spooked!

575
00:41:09,484 --> 00:41:11,289
Someone is coming.
Let's go hide.

576
00:41:28,715 --> 00:41:29,507
Boo!

577
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:51,312
You're not spooked at all?

578
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:53,584
If I were a real ghost, I'd be out of the job by now.

579
00:41:53,584 --> 00:41:55,194
You should thank me for not laughing actually.

580
00:41:56,484 --> 00:41:58,230
Dude, you have such a strong mentality.

581
00:41:58,230 --> 00:41:59,284
You're not afraid of ghosts?

582
00:41:59,284 --> 00:42:00,282
No.

583
00:42:00,672 --> 00:42:02,946
I saw you guys prepare for this during lunch time.

584
00:42:02,946 --> 00:42:03,804
One more thing...

585
00:42:04,284 --> 00:42:05,829
I watch Thunderous Sky channel too.

586
00:42:06,984 --> 00:42:08,484
Wonderful!

587
00:42:08,584 --> 00:42:10,784
It's a gathering of like-minded people here!

588
00:42:11,283 --> 00:42:12,285
So your name's Park?

589
00:42:12,783 --> 00:42:14,363
Would you like to join our gang?

590
00:42:14,589 --> 00:42:15,804
How many people are there in your gang?

591
00:42:15,957 --> 00:42:16,806
Just me and Bear.

592
00:42:17,884 --> 00:42:19,784
You guys have the audacity to call it a gang.

593
00:42:20,184 --> 00:42:21,859
So, will you join us?

594
00:42:22,484 --> 00:42:23,119
Mm.

595
00:42:23,484 --> 00:42:24,221
Count me in.

596
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,484
That's right!

597
00:42:26,484 --> 00:42:27,507
Thunderous Sky.

598
00:42:27,507 --> 00:42:28,484
Bang!

599
00:42:31,684 --> 00:42:34,124
I'm not surprised you guys get along so well.

600
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:37,279
Anyway, I have to thank Thunderous Sky.

601
00:42:37,884 --> 00:42:38,687
Why?

602
00:42:38,795 --> 00:42:40,209
This channel brought us together.

603
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:41,981
And it made me...

604
00:42:42,544 --> 00:42:44,665
love you like a bang!

605
00:42:45,228 --> 00:42:46,419
Bang!

606
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,434
Told ya...

607
00:42:51,434 --> 00:42:53,921
You're gonna love me like a bang!

608
00:43:05,084 --> 00:43:06,672
Since today is a special day,

609
00:43:07,684 --> 00:43:09,597
I decided to bring your perfume with me.

610
00:43:17,484 --> 00:43:19,572
Every time I smell this scent,

611
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,745
it brought me back to the wonderful moments

612
00:43:23,984 --> 00:43:25,484
that we've had together.

613
00:43:27,984 --> 00:43:28,780
You know,

614
00:43:29,278 --> 00:43:31,408
it makes me love you more and more every day.

615
00:43:38,314 --> 00:43:39,261
Ready?

616
00:43:41,684 --> 00:43:42,434
Let's go.

617
00:43:56,384 --> 00:43:58,592
Congratulations.
I wish you a lifetime of happiness.

618
00:44:08,084 --> 00:44:12,384
Now, it's time for the grooms...

619
00:44:12,384 --> 00:44:14,297
to exchange their vows.

620
00:44:26,484 --> 00:44:27,942
I'd like to thank you...

621
00:44:31,784 --> 00:44:33,242
for making me so happy

622
00:44:35,284 --> 00:44:36,784
from the first day

623
00:44:38,784 --> 00:44:40,204
to this very moment.

624
00:44:41,684 --> 00:44:43,744
No matter how life changes

625
00:44:44,284 --> 00:44:45,569
for you...

626
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:48,484
I will never change.

627
00:44:50,984 --> 00:44:52,356
I always miss you

628
00:44:52,984 --> 00:44:54,897
even though you never leave my side.

629
00:44:55,584 --> 00:44:57,354
I feel grateful

630
00:44:57,614 --> 00:44:59,202
that we always understand each other

631
00:45:01,784 --> 00:45:03,484
even with the smallest things.

632
00:45:08,684 --> 00:45:09,642
Lee...

633
00:45:13,984 --> 00:45:15,494
Whether it is 7 years,

634
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:17,884
20 years,

635
00:45:20,584 --> 00:45:22,484
or for the rest of my life...

636
00:45:25,584 --> 00:45:27,281
I will always be your Park

637
00:45:29,784 --> 00:45:31,524
who blushes red and gets flustered

638
00:45:33,884 --> 00:45:35,667
and who feels happy every time he's with you.

639
00:46:16,784 --> 00:46:18,984
I suppose this is the beauty of the ceremony.

640
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,547
Because even though you're just a guest,

641
00:46:21,547 --> 00:46:24,242
you can't help but feel emotional

642
00:46:24,242 --> 00:46:25,265
and happy for them

643
00:46:25,265 --> 00:46:26,983
so much that you shed tears of joy.

644
00:46:34,384 --> 00:46:35,669
Why are you sitting here all alone?

645
00:46:38,484 --> 00:46:40,029
Don't you want to take pictures with your friends?

646
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:42,701
I was just letting my mind wander.

647
00:46:43,484 --> 00:46:44,524
What were you thinking about?

648
00:46:44,884 --> 00:46:46,277
I was thinking about the first time we met.

649
00:46:49,484 --> 00:46:51,284
It was awkward, wasn't it?

650
00:46:51,284 --> 00:46:53,484
Back then...

651
00:46:53,722 --> 00:46:55,587
Nothing seemed to work out for us.

652
00:46:57,221 --> 00:46:59,964
But look at us now.

653
00:47:05,084 --> 00:47:06,846
It finally works out thanks to both of us.

654
00:47:08,184 --> 00:47:10,141
We fulfill each other.

655
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:12,242
If it wasn't for you,

656
00:47:12,784 --> 00:47:14,324
I'd still be a brat

657
00:47:14,324 --> 00:47:16,165
who can't take charge of his life.

658
00:47:19,684 --> 00:47:21,576
You're the only one

659
00:47:21,576 --> 00:47:23,684
who truly understands me.

660
00:47:23,684 --> 00:47:25,184
You make me feel so warm.

661
00:47:25,184 --> 00:47:26,686
You're not the only one who feels that way.

662
00:47:28,784 --> 00:47:31,922
I also feel warm every time

663
00:47:32,784 --> 00:47:34,199
I have you by my side.

664
00:47:36,584 --> 00:47:38,259
I've learned...

665
00:47:38,484 --> 00:47:39,956
how to let go

666
00:47:40,692 --> 00:47:42,274
and go easy on myself.

667
00:47:42,984 --> 00:47:44,404
Or sometimes,

668
00:47:44,684 --> 00:47:46,186
just thinking of you

669
00:47:47,684 --> 00:47:48,769
or...

670
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,484
the things you do for me

671
00:47:52,184 --> 00:47:53,616
is enough to make me happy.

672
00:47:54,984 --> 00:47:56,984
Every time I look at you,

673
00:47:57,484 --> 00:47:58,984
there's always this thought at the back of my head.

674
00:48:10,084 --> 00:48:12,722
I think I want to be with you forever.

675
00:48:14,236 --> 00:48:15,380
Are you reserving me for yourself?

676
00:48:16,684 --> 00:48:17,661
No.

677
00:48:18,484 --> 00:48:20,072
I'm keeping you with me for good.

678
00:48:20,984 --> 00:48:22,332
Look at Mek.

679
00:48:22,484 --> 00:48:24,984
He's stealing the spotlight for himself
right here at Park's wedding.

680
00:48:26,684 --> 00:48:28,594
That's okay. I allow it.

681
00:48:29,884 --> 00:48:33,484
Kim, I think I'll have to throw the flower bouquet to you then.

682
00:48:37,684 --> 00:48:40,074
Kim, would you marry me?
