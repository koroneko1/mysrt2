1
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,148
<i>Today, we're looking
at some of the hottest weather…</i>

2
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,056
{\an8}Hey.

3
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:11,687
What is it?

4
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,399
What?

5
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:18,694
We've been ordered to stand down.
They're scrapping the program.

6
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:21,947
They say we fell short.

7
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,241
The contract threshold is Mach 10.

8
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:28,453
Mach 10 is supposed to be in two months.
Today's test point is Mach 9.

9
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:30,372
Well, that's not good enough.

10
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:31,832
Says who?

11
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,458
Admiral Cain.

12
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,211
The Drone Ranger.

13
00:05:36,295 --> 00:05:38,797
He wants our budget
for his unmanned program.

14
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:42,384
He's on his way to kill the test
and shut us down personally.

15
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,691
Well, he isn't here yet.

16
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,280
They want Mach 10,

17
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:05,199
let's give 'em Mach 10.

18
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,136
Now remember,
the contract threshold is Mach 10.

19
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,723
Not 10.1. Not 10.2. Mach 10.

20
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,808
That should keep the program alive.

21
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:36,271
I don't like that look, Mav.

22
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:39,816
It's the only one I got.

23
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,370
<i>Control, this is</i> Dark star.
<i>How do you read?</i>

24
00:06:51,453 --> 00:06:53,830
<i>Dark star,</i> Control. Loud and clear. How me?

25
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,874
<i>Loud and clear.
Takeoff precheck's complete.</i>

26
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,167
Ready for APU start.

27
00:06:58,126 --> 00:06:59,920
<i>Ready left engine start.</i>

28
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,131
<i>Ready right engine start.</i>

29
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,342
Thumbs for taxi.

30
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:09,513
We are ready for taxi.

31
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:14,518
Tower, this is <i>Dark star</i>.
We are taxiing with information Alpha.

32
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:16,520
Dark star<i>, you are clear to taxi.</i>

33
00:07:16,603 --> 00:07:19,523
<i>Runway 21. Winds 210, 10.</i>

34
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:22,109
- Fuel temps are looking good.
- <i>Control concurs.</i>

35
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:24,862
<i>Battery's holding at 95%.
Cabin pressure looks good.</i>

36
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,154
<i>Control concurs.</i>

37
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,924
<i>Tower, this is</i> Dark star.
<i>We're ready for takeoff.</i>

38
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:30,909
<i>Requesting an unrestricted climb
to 600 and above.</i>

39
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:33,412
Dark star<i>, the runway and skies are yours.</i>

40
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:35,539
Rear Admiral Chester Cain.

41
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,876
Maverick, Cain just pulled up to the gate.

42
00:07:39,626 --> 00:07:41,044
It's not too late to stop, buddy.

43
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,756
<i>You know what happens to you
if you go through with this.</i>

44
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:49,386
I know what happens
to everyone else if I don't.

45
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,640
Dark star <i>is ready for takeoff.</i>

46
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:57,769
Everyone,

47
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,522
go for takeoff, starting with engine.

48
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:02,399
- Engine, go.
- Thermals, go.

49
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,568
- Fuel, go.
- Electric, go.

50
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,986
Control surfaces, go.

51
00:08:06,069 --> 00:08:08,780
Dark star<i>, Control.
You're cleared for takeoff.</i>

52
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:10,407
All right, sweetheart,

53
00:08:11,074 --> 00:08:12,242
one last ride.

54
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,980
Dark star<i>, you are cleared above 600.
Increase to Mach 3.5.</i>

55
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:45,901
Cleared above 600. Increase to Mach 3.5.

56
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:53,283
Admiral.

57
00:08:54,076 --> 00:08:56,620
- Just in time, sir.
- I'm early. So are you.

58
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:58,163
You care to explain?

59
00:08:58,247 --> 00:09:00,207
Transitioning to scramjet.

60
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,014
Mav, Admiral Cain is asking...

61
00:09:16,098 --> 00:09:18,559
- Ordering.
- Ordering that we bring her down.

62
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,609
<i>…within six…</i>

63
00:09:27,693 --> 00:09:29,504
This is where we've had trouble
with comms, sir.

64
00:09:29,528 --> 00:09:31,905
It's the Earth's curvature.
It's called "Earth Bulge."

65
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:33,323
Did anyone offer you a coffee?

66
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,075
Okay.

67
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:45,752
He's at Mach 7, pushing 8.

68
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:48,046
- Flight data?
- Receiving. Data is good.

69
00:09:53,427 --> 00:09:55,804
Temperature's climbing.
Response is still stable.

70
00:09:55,888 --> 00:09:56,888
We're feeling good.

71
00:10:00,517 --> 00:10:01,727
<i>Mach 8.8.</i>

72
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:03,729
8.9.

73
00:10:04,354 --> 00:10:05,647
Mach 9.

74
00:10:05,731 --> 00:10:07,441
He's the fastest man alive.

75
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:28,337
Talk to me, Goose.

76
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:31,465
Mach 9.1.

77
00:10:32,466 --> 00:10:33,467
9.2.

78
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:41,975
Mach 9.3.

79
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:45,896
9.4.

80
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:49,358
Approaching high hypersonic.

81
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:03,288
Windshield hot caution.

82
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,049
Surface temp rising.

83
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,390
Come on, sweetheart, just a little more.

84
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:23,267
Just a little.

85
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:28,062
Come on!

86
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,570
Come on!

87
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:41,910
Mach 10!

88
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,415
Put that in your Pentagon budget!

89
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,543
Sir.

90
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:02,347
Don't do it. Don't do it.

91
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,432
Just…

92
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,519
A little push.

93
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:13,400
Holy shit.

94
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:25,913
You got some balls, stick jockey.

95
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,414
I'll give you that.

96
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,836
Oh, shit.

97
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,258
Maverick.

98
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,471
Maverick!

99
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,814
Thank you.

100
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:35,816
Where am I?

101
00:13:37,276 --> 00:13:38,485
Earth.

102
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,418
<i>Maverick.</i>

103
00:13:55,169 --> 00:13:56,837
Thirty-plus years of service.

104
00:13:58,046 --> 00:13:59,423
Combat medals.

105
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,841
Citations.

106
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:05,929
Only man to shoot down three enemy planes
in the last 40 years.

107
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,973
"Distinguished."

108
00:14:08,056 --> 00:14:11,643
"Distinguished." "Distinguished."

109
00:14:13,395 --> 00:14:16,690
Yet you can't get a promotion,
you won't retire,

110
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:19,818
and despite your best efforts,
you refuse to die.

111
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:24,448
You should be at least a two-star admiral
by now, if not a senator.

112
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,617
Yet here you are:

113
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,369
Captain.

114
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:31,788
Why is that?

115
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,208
It's one of life's mysteries, sir.

116
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,794
This isn't a joke. I asked you a question.

117
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,465
I'm where I belong, sir.

118
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:44,676
Well, the navy doesn't see it that way.

119
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:46,803
Not anymore.

120
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,015
These planes you've been testing,

121
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:51,808
Captain,

122
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:55,354
one day, sooner than later,
they won't need pilots at all.

123
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,441
Pilots that need to sleep, eat,
take a piss.

124
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,820
Pilots that disobey orders.

125
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,200
All you did was buy some time
for those men out there.

126
00:15:10,285 --> 00:15:11,537
The future is coming,

127
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:14,414
and you're not in it.

128
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,418
Escort this man off the base.

129
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:23,924
Take him to his quarters.
Wait with him while he packs his gear.

130
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:29,388
I want him on the road to North Island
within the hour.

131
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:34,184
North Island, sir?

132
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,604
Call came in with impeccable timing,

133
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:41,358
right as I was driving here
to ground your ass once and for all.

134
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:45,362
It galls me to say it, but…

135
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:50,534
For reasons known only to the Almighty
and your guardian angel…

136
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:54,955
You've been called back to TOPGUN.

137
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:02,546
- Sir?
- You are dismissed, Captain.

138
00:16:07,801 --> 00:16:09,720
The end is inevitable, Maverick.

139
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,556
Your kind is headed for extinction.

140
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,853
Maybe so, sir.

141
00:16:19,521 --> 00:16:20,981
But not today.

142
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,757
<i>Captain Pete "Maverick" Mitchell.</i>

143
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:31,426
Your reputation precedes you.

144
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,762
Thank you, sir.

145
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,557
Wasn't a compliment.

146
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,351
I'm Admiral Beau Simpson.

147
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,603
I'm the Air Boss.
I believe you know Admiral Bates.

148
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:43,313
Warlock, sir.

149
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,108
Must admit,
I wasn't expecting an invitation back.

150
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:47,985
They're called orders, Maverick.

151
00:17:49,361 --> 00:17:50,863
You two have something in common.

152
00:17:50,946 --> 00:17:53,740
Cyclone here was first in his class
back in '88.

153
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:55,784
Actually, sir, I finished second.

154
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,453
Just want to manage expectations.

155
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:03,917
The target…

156
00:18:06,044 --> 00:18:08,755
Is an unsanctioned
uranium enrichment plant

157
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:11,300
built in violation
of a multilateral NATO treaty.

158
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:14,344
The uranium produced there
represents a direct threat

159
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,721
to our allies in the region.

160
00:18:15,804 --> 00:18:20,058
The Pentagon has tasked us with assembling
a strike team and taking it out

161
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:21,852
before it becomes fully operational.

162
00:18:22,895 --> 00:18:26,732
The plant sits in an underground bunker
at the end of this valley.

163
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,525
Said valley is GPS-jammed

164
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,403
and defended by an extensive
surface-to-air missile array

165
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:34,156
serving a limited number
of fifth-generation fighters,

166
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:38,202
which in turn are backed up by
a plentiful reserve of surplus aircraft.

167
00:18:38,285 --> 00:18:40,579
Even a few old F-14s.

168
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:43,022
Seems like we're not the only ones
holding on to old relics.

169
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,251
What's your read, Captain?

170
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,216
Well, sir, normally this would be
a cakewalk for the F-35's stealth,

171
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:55,010
but the GPS-jamming negates that.

172
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:58,847
And a surface-to-air threat necessitates
a low-level laser-guided strike

173
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:00,349
tailor-made for the F-18.

174
00:19:00,432 --> 00:19:01,433
I figure,

175
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,102
two precision bombs, minimum.

176
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:06,647
Makes it four aircraft flying in pairs.

177
00:19:07,189 --> 00:19:09,399
That is one hell of a steep climb
out of there,

178
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,818
exposing you
to all the surface-to-air missiles.

179
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:13,779
You survive that,

180
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,657
it's a dogfight all the way home.

181
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:19,368
All requirements for which
you have real-world experience.

182
00:19:20,118 --> 00:19:22,204
Not in the same mission, sir.

183
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:25,958
No.

184
00:19:28,794 --> 00:19:31,255
No, someone's not coming back from this.

185
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,798
Can it be done or not?

186
00:19:33,465 --> 00:19:35,300
How soon before the plant
becomes operational?

187
00:19:35,384 --> 00:19:37,177
Three weeks. Maybe less.

188
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:41,181
Well, it's been a while
since I've flown an F-18, and…

189
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,643
I'm not sure who I'd trust
to fly the other three.

190
00:19:44,726 --> 00:19:46,854
But I'll find a way to make it work.

191
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:48,605
I think you misunderstand, Captain.

192
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:50,148
Sir?

193
00:19:50,232 --> 00:19:53,485
We don't want you to fly it.
We want you to teach it.

194
00:19:56,405 --> 00:19:57,698
Teach, sir?

195
00:19:59,241 --> 00:20:02,744
We've recalled 12 TOPGUN graduates
from their squadrons.

196
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,539
We want you to narrow that pool
down to six.

197
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,791
They'll fly the mission.

198
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:10,919
Is there a problem, Captain?

199
00:20:12,838 --> 00:20:15,132
You know there is, sir.

200
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,341
Yeah.

201
00:20:17,843 --> 00:20:20,345
Bradley Bradshaw, aka "Rooster."

202
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:22,264
I understand you used to fly
with his old man.

203
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:24,141
What was his call sign?

204
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:26,518
"Goose," sir.

205
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,936
Tragic what happened.

206
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,938
Captain Mitchell was cleared
of any wrongdoing.

207
00:20:30,022 --> 00:20:31,857
Goose's death was an accident.

208
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,567
Is that how you see it, Captain?

209
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,736
Is that how Goose's son sees it?

210
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:41,742
With all due respect, sir,
I'm not a teacher.

211
00:20:41,825 --> 00:20:43,493
You were a TOPGUN instructor before.

212
00:20:43,577 --> 00:20:45,996
That was almost 30 years ago.
I lasted two months.

213
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,331
It's not where I belong.

214
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,583
Then let me be perfectly blunt.

215
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,920
You were not my first choice.
In fact, you weren't even on the list.

216
00:20:53,712 --> 00:20:56,256
You are here at the request
of Admiral Kazansky.

217
00:20:56,965 --> 00:21:00,636
Now, Iceman happens to be a man
I deeply admire,

218
00:21:00,719 --> 00:21:03,722
and he seems to think that you have
something left to offer the navy.

219
00:21:04,723 --> 00:21:06,642
What that is, I can't imagine.

220
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,978
You don't have to take this job.

221
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:11,313
But let me be clear:

222
00:21:11,396 --> 00:21:14,316
This will be your last post, Captain.

223
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:19,530
You fly for TOPGUN,
or you don't fly for the navy ever again.

224
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,915
Twenty bucks you can't get three in a row.

225
00:22:11,331 --> 00:22:13,542
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

226
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,212
Pete.

227
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:19,715
Penny?

228
00:22:20,674 --> 00:22:24,094
- What are you doing here?
- I should ask you the same thing.

229
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:27,556
- Well, that is a long story.
- I doubt that.

230
00:22:27,639 --> 00:22:28,473
Yeah.

231
00:22:28,557 --> 00:22:30,350
Who'd you piss off this time?

232
00:22:30,434 --> 00:22:31,852
Another admiral.

233
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:32,936
Exactly.

234
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:37,816
- Are you mad at me?
- Oh, Pete.

235
00:22:38,775 --> 00:22:41,945
I can never stay mad at you.
That's the problem.

236
00:22:43,405 --> 00:22:44,698
I got to say,

237
00:22:44,781 --> 00:22:48,327
North Island is the one place
I thought for sure I'd never run into you.

238
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:51,788
- How long you been here?
- Bought this place about three years ago.

239
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:53,707
- Three years?
- Yeah.

240
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:58,295
Not long after you got shipped off to the
desert for pissing off that other admiral.

241
00:22:59,213 --> 00:23:01,340
That was three years ago?

242
00:23:02,466 --> 00:23:04,635
You must be in a lot of trouble.

243
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:07,304
No way you'd come back here willingly.

244
00:23:09,139 --> 00:23:10,140
Well,

245
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,559
you'll sort it out.

246
00:23:13,227 --> 00:23:14,436
No, I think…

247
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:18,315
- I think this is it.
- Come on, Pete.

248
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:21,151
You've been saying that
as long as I've known you.

249
00:23:21,235 --> 00:23:24,863
You said it after they busted you for
taking me on a joyride in that F-18.

250
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,866
Then the next thing I know,
you're off to Bosnia.

251
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,078
Then Iraq. Both times.

252
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,788
You get yourself in trouble,

253
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:36,792
Iceman makes a call,
and you're back in the air.

254
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:38,418
Penny, this is different.

255
00:23:38,502 --> 00:23:40,003
Pete, trust me,

256
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:42,339
as improbable as it seems right now,

257
00:23:42,422 --> 00:23:45,759
somehow you'll be back in a fighter plane
with your tail on fire.

258
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:48,929
- Penny…
- Too late.

259
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:49,847
What?

260
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:52,099
You were about to ask me
what time I get off.

261
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,354
Don't give me that look.

262
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:00,983
I'm not giving you any look. I swear.

263
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:04,194
It always ends the same with us, Pete.

264
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:07,531
Let's not start this time.

265
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:12,952
Okay.

266
00:24:13,704 --> 00:24:14,705
Okay.

267
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:20,878
You look good.

268
00:24:31,054 --> 00:24:32,639
Much appreciated, pal.

269
00:24:35,392 --> 00:24:36,476
What am I missing?

270
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:42,816
"Disrespect a lady, the navy,
or put your cell phone on my bar…"

271
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,776
"…and you buy a round."

272
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,486
For everyone?

273
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,323
I'm afraid rules are rules.
You're lucky it's early.

274
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,159
Oh, come on!

275
00:24:52,743 --> 00:24:54,703
What do we have here?

276
00:24:56,413 --> 00:24:58,665
If it ain't Phoenix!

277
00:24:58,749 --> 00:25:01,168
And here I thought we were special,
Coyote.

278
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,464
Turns out the invite went to anyone.

279
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:07,883
Fellas, this here's Bagman.

280
00:25:07,966 --> 00:25:09,718
- Hangman.
- Whatever.

281
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,513
You're looking at the only naval aviator
on active duty

282
00:25:12,596 --> 00:25:14,097
with a confirmed air-to-air kill.

283
00:25:14,181 --> 00:25:15,015
Stop.

284
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:19,102
Mind you, the other guy was in
a museum piece from the Korean War.

285
00:25:19,186 --> 00:25:21,939
- Cold War.
- Different wars, same century.

286
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,023
Not this one.

287
00:25:23,106 --> 00:25:24,483
Who are your friends?

288
00:25:24,566 --> 00:25:26,568
- Payback.
- Fanboy.

289
00:25:26,652 --> 00:25:28,654
- Hey, Coyote.
- Hey.

290
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,280
- Who's he?
- Who's who?

291
00:25:33,367 --> 00:25:34,660
When did you get in?

292
00:25:35,285 --> 00:25:37,371
I've been here the whole time.

293
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:40,082
- The man's a stealth pilot.
- Literally.

294
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:42,543
Weapons systems officer, actually.

295
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:44,628
With no sense of humor.

296
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:47,756
What do they call you?

297
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:49,800
Bob.

298
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,134
No, your call sign.

299
00:25:54,054 --> 00:25:55,055
Bob.

300
00:25:55,556 --> 00:25:56,556
Bob Floyd.

301
00:25:57,349 --> 00:26:00,185
You're my new backs eater? From Lemoore?

302
00:26:01,353 --> 00:26:03,063
Looks like it. Yeah.

303
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,985
Nine-ball, Bob.

304
00:26:08,735 --> 00:26:09,735
Rack 'em.

305
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:12,823
Okay.

306
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,492
- Penny, my dear.
- Yeah.

307
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:17,744
I'll have four more on the old-timer.

308
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,096
Bradshaw!

309
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,348
Is that you?

310
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:46,064
This is how I find out you're stateside?

311
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,066
Yeah, I just thought I'd surprise you.

312
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:52,988
I guess I surprised you back.

313
00:26:54,698 --> 00:26:56,498
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

314
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:00,954
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

315
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:02,748
Much appreciated, Pops.

316
00:27:10,214 --> 00:27:13,050
How about ringing me up
before the evening rush?

317
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,440
Bradshaw.

318
00:27:28,524 --> 00:27:30,108
As I live and breathe.

319
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:31,944
Hangman.

320
00:27:32,027 --> 00:27:34,196
You look… good.

321
00:27:35,364 --> 00:27:37,115
Well, I am good, Rooster.

322
00:27:38,951 --> 00:27:39,952
I'm very good.

323
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:42,079
In fact,

324
00:27:42,162 --> 00:27:43,956
I am too good to be true.

325
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,290
So,

326
00:27:45,374 --> 00:27:47,918
anybody know what this special
detachment is all about?

327
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:51,046
No, mission's a mission.
They don't confront me.

328
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:54,758
What I want to know:
Who's gonna be team leader?

329
00:27:55,467 --> 00:27:59,471
And which one of y'all has what it takes
to follow me?

330
00:28:00,973 --> 00:28:04,476
Hangman, the only place you'll lead anyone
is an early grave.

331
00:28:13,318 --> 00:28:17,072
Well, anyone who follows you
is just gonna run out of fuel.

332
00:28:17,906 --> 00:28:20,200
But that's just you, ain't it, Rooster?

333
00:28:20,993 --> 00:28:23,495
You're snug on that perch,

334
00:28:23,579 --> 00:28:25,789
waiting for just the right moment…

335
00:28:27,916 --> 00:28:29,251
That never comes.

336
00:28:32,671 --> 00:28:34,590
I love this song!

337
00:28:41,722 --> 00:28:43,390
Well, he hasn't changed.

338
00:28:44,433 --> 00:28:46,602
Nope. Sure hasn't.

339
00:28:51,190 --> 00:28:52,232
Check it out.

340
00:28:53,317 --> 00:28:54,443
More patches.

341
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:58,071
That's Harvard, Yale, Omaha.
Shit, that's Fritz.

342
00:28:58,155 --> 00:29:00,365
What the hell kind of mission is this?

343
00:29:01,366 --> 00:29:03,368
That's not the question
we should be asking.

344
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:06,163
Everyone here is the best there is.

345
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,625
Who the hell are they gonna get
to teach us?

346
00:29:13,045 --> 00:29:14,588
It's been declined.

347
00:29:15,172 --> 00:29:16,172
You're kidding.

348
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,941
Hey, guys. Come on.

349
00:29:48,038 --> 00:29:49,081
How about…

350
00:29:50,624 --> 00:29:52,376
That won't cover it.

351
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,342
I'll come by tomorrow
and bring you the cash.

352
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,303
I'm afraid rules are rules, Pete.

353
00:30:09,393 --> 00:30:12,271
Overboard! Overboard!

354
00:30:13,188 --> 00:30:14,439
Really?

355
00:30:15,482 --> 00:30:18,569
Overboard! Overboard!

356
00:30:25,784 --> 00:30:27,661
Great to see you, Pete!

357
00:30:28,328 --> 00:30:31,164
Overboard! Overboard!

358
00:30:34,793 --> 00:30:37,171
Thanks for the beers! Come back anytime!

359
00:30:48,807 --> 00:30:51,310
<i>You shake my nerves
And you rattle my brain</i>

360
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:54,271
<i>Too much love drives a man insane</i>

361
00:30:54,354 --> 00:30:57,024
<i>You broke my will, but what a thrill</i>

362
00:30:57,107 --> 00:31:00,319
<i>Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!</i>

363
00:31:00,402 --> 00:31:03,071
<i>I laughed at love
'Cause I thought it was funny</i>

364
00:31:03,155 --> 00:31:06,283
<i>But you came along and you moved me, honey</i>

365
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:09,119
<i>I changed my mind, this love is fine</i>

366
00:31:09,203 --> 00:31:11,955
<i>Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!</i>

367
00:31:12,039 --> 00:31:14,333
<i>Kiss me, baby</i>

368
00:31:19,922 --> 00:31:22,758
<i>Goodness gracious, great balls of fire!</i>

369
00:31:39,233 --> 00:31:42,319
<i>Altitude 8,000… 7,000…</i>

370
00:31:42,402 --> 00:31:44,738
<i>Goose, I can't reach the ejection handle.</i>

371
00:31:44,821 --> 00:31:46,823
<i>Eject, eject, eject!</i>

372
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,248
Goose! Oh, no!

373
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:57,125
God, he loved flying with you, Maverick.

374
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:42,421
<i>Attention on deck!</i>

375
00:32:53,348 --> 00:32:54,391
Morning.

376
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:57,227
Welcome to your special training
detachment.

377
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:58,353
Be seated.

378
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:01,607
I'm Admiral Bates, NAWDC commander.

379
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:03,442
You're all TOPGUN graduates.

380
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:05,527
The elite.

381
00:33:05,611 --> 00:33:07,613
The best of the best.

382
00:33:08,197 --> 00:33:10,032
That was yesterday.

383
00:33:11,074 --> 00:33:15,078
The enemy's new fifth-generation fighter
has leveled the playing field.

384
00:33:15,162 --> 00:33:16,788
Details are few, but you can be sure

385
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:18,916
we no longer possess
the technological advantage.

386
00:33:18,999 --> 00:33:22,294
Success, now more than ever,

387
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:25,547
comes down to the man or woman in the box.

388
00:33:26,465 --> 00:33:28,759
Half of you will make the cut.

389
00:33:28,842 --> 00:33:30,719
One of you will be named mission leader.

390
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,972
The other half will remain in reserve.

391
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:36,975
Your instructor is a TOPGUN graduate

392
00:33:37,059 --> 00:33:39,603
with real-world experience
in every mission aspect

393
00:33:39,686 --> 00:33:41,271
you will be expected to master.

394
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:44,441
His exploits are legendary.

395
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,070
And he's considered
to be one of the finest pilots

396
00:33:48,153 --> 00:33:50,155
this program has ever produced.

397
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:53,158
What he has to teach you

398
00:33:53,242 --> 00:33:56,620
may very well mean the difference
between life and death.

399
00:33:57,454 --> 00:33:59,790
I give you Captain Pete Mitchell.

400
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:03,085
Call sign: "Maverick."

401
00:34:07,631 --> 00:34:08,632
Good morning.

402
00:34:17,014 --> 00:34:18,684
The F-18 NATOPS.

403
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:23,772
It contains everything they want you
to know about your aircraft.

404
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,568
I'm assuming you know the book
inside and out.

405
00:34:27,650 --> 00:34:28,902
- Damn right.
- Damn straight.

406
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,152
You got it.

407
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,705
So does your enemy.

408
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:41,790
And we're off.

409
00:34:42,833 --> 00:34:46,043
But what the enemy doesn't know
is your limits.

410
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:48,547
I intend to find them,

411
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,257
test them,

412
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:52,217
push beyond.

413
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:56,972
Today we'll start
with what you only think you know.

414
00:34:58,891 --> 00:35:00,684
You show me what you're made of.

415
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:06,815
Rooster.

416
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,026
Bradley.

417
00:35:09,651 --> 00:35:11,403
Lieutenant Bradshaw!

418
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:14,406
Yes, sir.

419
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:17,117
Let's not do it like this.

420
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,286
You gonna wash me out?

421
00:35:20,913 --> 00:35:22,623
That'll be up to you, not me.

422
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:26,293
Am I dismissed?

423
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:46,271
Good morning, aviators.
This is your captain speaking.

424
00:35:46,355 --> 00:35:48,482
Welcome to basic fighter maneuvers.

425
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:52,986
<i>As briefed,
today's exercise is dog fighting.</i>

426
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,696
<i>Guns only, no missiles.</i>

427
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:58,825
We do not go below the hard deck
of 5,000 feet.

428
00:35:58,909 --> 00:36:01,828
<i>Working as a team,
you have to shoot me down, or else.</i>

429
00:36:01,912 --> 00:36:05,249
- Or else what, sir?
- Or else I shoot back.

430
00:36:05,332 --> 00:36:08,252
<i>If I shoot either one of you down,
you both lose.</i>

431
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,212
This guy needs an ego check.

432
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:11,630
We'll see to that.

433
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:14,393
- What say we put some skin in the game?
- What do you have in mind?

434
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:17,344
Whoever gets shot down first
has to do 200 push-ups.

435
00:36:17,427 --> 00:36:20,180
Guys. That's a lot of push-ups.

436
00:36:20,264 --> 00:36:22,391
They don't call it an exercise
for nothing, sir.

437
00:36:22,474 --> 00:36:24,393
You got yourself a deal, gentlemen.

438
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:26,770
Fight's on. Let's turn and burn.

439
00:36:28,355 --> 00:36:29,606
Fanboy, you see him?

440
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:32,693
Nothing on radar up ahead.
He must be somewhere behind us.

441
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,947
- Damn it!
- What the hell?

442
00:36:37,030 --> 00:36:38,030
Shit!

443
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:43,412
<i>Easy, Maverick.</i>

444
00:36:43,495 --> 00:36:46,582
Let's try not to get fired
on the first day.

445
00:36:46,665 --> 00:36:49,585
Tally, tally, tally! Maverick's coming in!
Break left!

446
00:36:49,668 --> 00:36:50,836
Breaking left.

447
00:36:52,838 --> 00:36:54,882
Payback, where's your wing man?

448
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:57,176
- Rooster, where are you?
- I got your back.

449
00:36:57,259 --> 00:36:59,761
I'm coming. Hang in there. Hang in there.

450
00:36:59,845 --> 00:37:01,180
Hurry up, man! Hurry up!

451
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:06,894
- Payback, break right.
- Breaking right.

452
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:11,690
Rooster just saved your life, fellas.
But it's gonna cost him.

453
00:37:11,773 --> 00:37:13,442
Not this time, old man.

454
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:17,738
Don't let him get to you, Maverick.

455
00:37:24,703 --> 00:37:27,331
Rooster, you're too low! Pull up!
You're hitting the hard deck!

456
00:37:27,414 --> 00:37:29,917
- <i>Altitude. Altitude.
</i>- Oh, shit.

457
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:35,339
That's a kill.

458
00:37:35,422 --> 00:37:37,799
Down! 109.

459
00:37:38,759 --> 00:37:41,386
Down! 110.

460
00:37:43,305 --> 00:37:45,057
That should be us down there.

461
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,266
But it's not.

462
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:49,561
And now you know a little something
about Rooster.

463
00:37:51,563 --> 00:37:53,750
Hold that tarmac down till we get back,
brother, all right?

464
00:37:53,774 --> 00:37:55,484
Get in there, boys.

465
00:37:58,612 --> 00:38:00,364
- That's a kill.
- Damn!

466
00:38:01,114 --> 00:38:02,699
- Smoked.
- Damn it.

467
00:38:03,408 --> 00:38:06,036
It was all fun and games in that selfie,
wasn't it? Down!

468
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:06,954
<i>Say, Phoenix.</i>

469
00:38:07,037 --> 00:38:09,873
How's about we tell everybody
"Bob" stands for something?

470
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:12,292
<i>- Other than Robert, I mean.</i>
- Don't take the bait, Bob.

471
00:38:12,376 --> 00:38:14,419
Want to know why we call him Hangman?

472
00:38:14,503 --> 00:38:16,755
I got it. "Baby On Board."

473
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:20,634
Shit!

474
00:38:21,927 --> 00:38:23,846
Greetings, aviators. Fight's on.

475
00:38:24,471 --> 00:38:26,723
<i>All right, Phoenix,
let's take this guy out!</i>

476
00:38:26,807 --> 00:38:27,975
Watch your back, Phoenix.

477
00:38:28,058 --> 00:38:29,935
- Break right!
- Breaking right.

478
00:38:32,354 --> 00:38:33,355
Where's he going?

479
00:38:33,438 --> 00:38:36,525
That's why we call him Hangman.
He'll always hang you out to dry.

480
00:38:37,526 --> 00:38:39,027
Leaving your wing man.

481
00:38:39,111 --> 00:38:40,839
There's a strategy
I haven't seen in a while.

482
00:38:40,863 --> 00:38:43,282
He called you a man, Phoenix.
You gonna take that?

483
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:44,843
So long as he doesn't call you a man.

484
00:38:44,867 --> 00:38:46,827
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

485
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:48,912
Jesus, his nose is already coming around!

486
00:38:48,996 --> 00:38:50,372
Get him off me, Hangman!

487
00:38:50,455 --> 00:38:54,418
For all you folks at home,
this is how you bury a fossil.

488
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:57,129
All right, Hangman.
Time to teach you a lesson.

489
00:38:57,212 --> 00:38:59,089
- You're out, Phoenix.
- Son of a bitch!

490
00:39:00,382 --> 00:39:01,383
That's it.

491
00:39:01,466 --> 00:39:03,969
- Let's go, Mav. Let's see what you got.
- Come get me.

492
00:39:06,388 --> 00:39:08,098
Evil be gone. Hangman's coming.

493
00:39:09,308 --> 00:39:11,518
Yeah, you're good. I'll give you that.

494
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:21,278
Shit.
Phoenix, I can't see him. How close am I?

495
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,739
- Phoenix?
- I'm dead, dickhead.

496
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,699
See you in the afterlife, Bagman.

497
00:39:27,117 --> 00:39:28,702
Where is he? Where is he?

498
00:39:29,411 --> 00:39:30,704
That's a kill.

499
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:35,000
Seventy-nine. Down. Eighty. Down.

500
00:39:35,083 --> 00:39:36,251
<i>Let's go. Who's next?</i>

501
00:39:37,503 --> 00:39:39,254
- I got you, Omaha.
- Damn it!

502
00:39:42,299 --> 00:39:44,551
- Lights out, Coyote.
- Copy kill.

503
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:49,097
Down. Fifty-one. Down. Fifty-two.

504
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:54,937
So, Rooster, mind if I ask you
a personal question?

505
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,313
Would it matter if I did?

506
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:58,649
What's the story with you and Maverick?

507
00:39:58,732 --> 00:40:01,777
- It seems like he's got you rattled.
- That's none of your business.

508
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,695
Now where the hell is he?

509
00:40:03,779 --> 00:40:05,447
<i>Been here the whole time.</i>

510
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:08,367
Holy shit.

511
00:40:10,452 --> 00:40:11,620
You see me now?

512
00:40:12,538 --> 00:40:14,331
Come on, let's get it over with.

513
00:40:14,957 --> 00:40:16,375
Fight's on!

514
00:40:18,085 --> 00:40:20,420
What is with these two?

515
00:40:24,967 --> 00:40:28,428
All right, you put us here.
How you gonna get yourself out?

516
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,098
You can bail out anytime.

517
00:40:31,181 --> 00:40:32,516
How low you want to go, Rooster?

518
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,853
I can go as low as you, sir!
And that's saying something.

519
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,692
What's past is past. For both of us.

520
00:40:41,775 --> 00:40:43,610
You'd like to believe that, wouldn't you?

521
00:40:43,694 --> 00:40:46,780
Hard deck is 5,000 feet, fellas.
You are running out of room.

522
00:40:47,781 --> 00:40:48,782
<i>Altitude.</i>

523
00:40:48,866 --> 00:40:50,868
Your strategy
is about to run us into the ground.

524
00:40:50,951 --> 00:40:53,412
- What's your move?
<i>- Altitude. Altitude.</i>

525
00:40:53,495 --> 00:40:54,872
<i>Altitude.</i>

526
00:40:56,665 --> 00:40:59,543
<i>Altitude. Altitude. Altitude.</i>

527
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,045
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

528
00:41:04,089 --> 00:41:06,758
<i>Pull up! Pull up! Pull up! Pull up!</i>

529
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:08,468
<i>Pull up! Pull up!</i>

530
00:41:11,722 --> 00:41:13,432
You got it. Don't think, just do.

531
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:17,144
Come on, Rooster, you got him!
Drop down and take the shot!

532
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:19,770
It's too low.

533
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:22,441
Too late. You had your chance.

534
00:41:28,572 --> 00:41:31,325
That's a kill. Knock it off.

535
00:41:32,326 --> 00:41:33,452
Damn it!

536
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:35,412
Same old Rooster.

537
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:40,292
Go see Hondo about your push-ups.

538
00:41:48,509 --> 00:41:50,010
All right, that's enough.

539
00:41:50,677 --> 00:41:52,763
Rooster. That's enough, man.

540
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:10,822
Breaking the hard deck, insubordination.
Are you trying to get kicked out?

541
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:12,366
Don't worry about it.

542
00:42:12,866 --> 00:42:15,369
Look, I'm going on this mission.

543
00:42:16,328 --> 00:42:19,122
But if you get kicked out,
you leave us flying with Hangman.

544
00:42:19,748 --> 00:42:23,377
- Talk to me. What the hell was that?
- He pulled my papers.

545
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:26,922
- What? Who?
- Maverick.

546
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,634
He pulled my application
to the Naval Academy.

547
00:42:31,718 --> 00:42:33,720
Set me back four years.

548
00:42:36,223 --> 00:42:37,683
Why would he do that?

549
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:46,066
The hard deck is 5,000 feet
above ground level.

550
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:48,485
A parameter is set
not just for the safety of our pilots,

551
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:50,070
but for the safety of their aircraft.

552
00:42:50,153 --> 00:42:54,366
5,000 feet is not just a rule.
It is a law, as immutable as gravity.

553
00:42:54,449 --> 00:42:57,119
The hard deck will be much lower
for the mission, sir.

554
00:42:57,202 --> 00:43:00,330
And it will not change
without my approval!

555
00:43:00,414 --> 00:43:02,332
Especially not in the middle
of an exercise.

556
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,378
And that Cobra maneuver of yours?
That could've got all three of you killed.

557
00:43:06,461 --> 00:43:08,338
I never want to see that shit again.

558
00:43:09,423 --> 00:43:11,675
What exactly do you suppose
you were teaching, Captain?

559
00:43:11,758 --> 00:43:14,237
That as good as they are, sir,
they still have something to learn.

560
00:43:14,261 --> 00:43:16,906
You are talking about the best
fighter pilots on the planet, Captain.

561
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,741
And they've been told that
their entire career,

562
00:43:18,765 --> 00:43:20,702
while they've been dropping bombs
from a high altitude

563
00:43:20,726 --> 00:43:22,477
with little to no dog fighting.

564
00:43:22,561 --> 00:43:25,373
The parameters of this mission call for
something they have never encountered.

565
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:29,109
Okay, you have less than three weeks
to teach them how to fight as a team

566
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:31,236
and how to strike the target.

567
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,071
And how to come home.

568
00:43:35,908 --> 00:43:37,910
And how to come home, sir.

569
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:45,250
Every mission has its risks.

570
00:43:46,126 --> 00:43:48,003
These pilots accept that.

571
00:43:48,086 --> 00:43:49,671
I don't, sir.

572
00:43:53,884 --> 00:43:55,278
Every morning, from this day forward,

573
00:43:55,302 --> 00:43:58,013
you will brief us on
your instructional plans in writing.

574
00:43:58,096 --> 00:44:01,016
And nothing will change
without my express approval.

575
00:44:01,099 --> 00:44:04,269
- Including the hard deck, sir?
- Especially the hard deck, Captain.

576
00:44:06,355 --> 00:44:07,439
Sir.

577
00:44:08,357 --> 00:44:09,566
What is this?

578
00:44:09,650 --> 00:44:11,330
It's a request to lower
the hard deck, sir,

579
00:44:11,401 --> 00:44:13,881
to practice a low-level bombing run
per the mission parameters.

580
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:22,538
You could learn a thing or two
about timing, Captain.

581
00:44:23,372 --> 00:44:24,372
<i>Yo, Coyote.</i>

582
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,333
Take a look at this.

583
00:44:30,254 --> 00:44:32,965
The man, the legend. There he is.

584
00:44:33,048 --> 00:44:35,050
No, no, no. Next to him.

585
00:44:36,009 --> 00:44:38,053
He look familiar to you?

586
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,598
What have we here?

587
00:44:42,391 --> 00:44:44,101
Bradshaw.

588
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,728
As I live and breathe.

589
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:52,484
Hey, Theo, you got big.

590
00:44:53,318 --> 00:44:54,444
Hey, Mav.

591
00:45:01,535 --> 00:45:02,578
Amelia?

592
00:45:02,661 --> 00:45:04,204
I know. I got big.

593
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:05,539
Yes.

594
00:45:06,623 --> 00:45:07,916
Bar opens at 5:00.

595
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,752
No, I just came by to pay off a debt.

596
00:45:10,836 --> 00:45:12,087
Mom!

597
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,761
- Hey, how's your dad?
- With his wife, in Hawaii.

598
00:45:19,845 --> 00:45:21,221
Mom!

599
00:45:22,181 --> 00:45:24,308
Mav says he owes you money.

600
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:27,811
- Don't worry about it.
- I insist.

601
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:34,693
Thank you, Captain.
Consider your tab closed.

602
00:45:35,694 --> 00:45:37,571
Captain? Still?

603
00:45:38,197 --> 00:45:40,324
A highly decorated captain.

604
00:45:40,407 --> 00:45:41,450
Finish up.

605
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:43,327
We have to get the boat to the yard.

606
00:45:43,410 --> 00:45:45,370
- I can't go.
- What do you mean, you can't go?

607
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:48,790
Test tomorrow. I have to study.
They only told us today.

608
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:50,834
Well, I can't sail her alone.

609
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,336
Just use the engine.

610
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,588
Why are we taking her to the yard?

611
00:45:55,214 --> 00:45:56,673
To fix the engine.

612
00:45:57,466 --> 00:45:58,467
I can help.

613
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:07,935
- Little rougher than I was expecting.
- You don't say.

614
00:46:08,644 --> 00:46:11,605
Pull on the back stay.
We'll de-power the sails.

615
00:46:11,688 --> 00:46:12,689
Okay.

616
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:14,816
What does that mean?

617
00:46:16,235 --> 00:46:18,487
You're supposed to be in the navy!

618
00:46:18,570 --> 00:46:21,907
I don't sail boats, Penny. I land on them.

619
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:25,661
It's sort of like raising the flaps
on an airplane.

620
00:46:25,744 --> 00:46:27,204
So how do I do that?

621
00:46:27,955 --> 00:46:30,165
You pull on that green line up there.

622
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:31,583
Green line.

623
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:35,671
Yep. Pull it hard.

624
00:46:35,754 --> 00:46:38,674
Yep. Crank that winch right there,

625
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:40,551
tighten the jib.

626
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:43,595
- Crank it. You okay?
- Yeah.

627
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:46,138
Good.

628
00:46:47,349 --> 00:46:48,350
Now,

629
00:46:49,768 --> 00:46:51,186
you ready?

630
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:54,189
For what?

631
00:46:54,773 --> 00:46:56,316
The afterburner.

632
00:47:16,628 --> 00:47:18,463
Now you're in the navy.

633
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:42,571
Thanks for helping out today.

634
00:47:44,281 --> 00:47:45,699
I'm not exactly sure I helped.

635
00:47:51,163 --> 00:47:52,664
Don't give me that look.

636
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:54,082
What look?

637
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:55,792
That one.

638
00:47:59,087 --> 00:48:00,380
Good night, Pete.

639
00:48:01,173 --> 00:48:02,508
Night, Penny.

640
00:48:17,981 --> 00:48:19,483
Mom, is that you?

641
00:48:20,108 --> 00:48:21,401
Yeah, it's me.

642
00:48:22,402 --> 00:48:24,112
I'll make you dinner.

643
00:48:24,196 --> 00:48:25,197
Okay.

644
00:48:31,411 --> 00:48:33,664
Time is your greatest enemy.

645
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:37,209
Phase one of the mission
will be a low-level ingress

646
00:48:37,292 --> 00:48:39,044
attacking in two-plane teams.

647
00:48:39,628 --> 00:48:41,839
You'll fly along this narrow canyon
to your target.

648
00:48:41,922 --> 00:48:45,342
Radar-guided surface-to-air missiles
defend the area.

649
00:48:45,425 --> 00:48:47,678
These SAMs, they're lethal.

650
00:48:48,345 --> 00:48:52,224
But they were designed to protect
the skies above, not the canyon below.

651
00:48:52,307 --> 00:48:56,186
That's because the enemy knows no one is
insane enough to try and fly below them.

652
00:48:57,104 --> 00:48:59,064
That's exactly
what I'm gonna train you to do.

653
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:04,319
On the day, your altitude
will be 100 feet maximum.

654
00:49:04,403 --> 00:49:07,531
You exceed this altitude,
radar will spot you,

655
00:49:08,407 --> 00:49:09,908
and you're dead.

656
00:49:11,034 --> 00:49:12,995
Your airspeed will be 660 knots

657
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:15,080
minimum.

658
00:49:15,163 --> 00:49:17,499
Time to target: two and a half minutes.

659
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,837
That's because fifth-generation fighters
wait at an air base nearby.

660
00:49:22,713 --> 00:49:27,134
In a head-to-head with these planes
in your F-18s, you're dead.

661
00:49:27,885 --> 00:49:30,846
That's why you need to get in,
hit your target and be gone

662
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:34,099
before these planes
even have a chance of catching you.

663
00:49:34,183 --> 00:49:37,019
This makes time your greatest adversary.

664
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:42,149
<i>You'll fly a route in your nav system
that simulates the canyon.</i>

665
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:44,610
<i>The faster you navigate this canyon,</i>

666
00:49:44,693 --> 00:49:47,362
<i>the harder it'll be to stay
under the radar of these enemy SAMs.</i>

667
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:49,489
<i>The tighter the turns,</i>

668
00:49:49,573 --> 00:49:52,784
<i>the more intensely the force of gravity
on your body multiplies,</i>

669
00:49:53,452 --> 00:49:55,204
<i>compressing your lungs,</i>

670
00:49:55,287 --> 00:49:56,705
<i>forcing the blood from your brain,</i>

671
00:49:56,788 --> 00:50:00,000
<i>impairing your judgment and reaction time.</i>

672
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:02,461
So for today's lesson,
we're gonna take it easy on you.

673
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:05,547
Max ceiling: 300 feet.
Time to target: three minutes.

674
00:50:07,424 --> 00:50:08,634
Good luck.

675
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:18,852
Time to target is one minute 30.

676
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:21,355
We are two seconds behind.
Increase to 480 knots.

677
00:50:21,438 --> 00:50:22,689
We got to move, Coyote.

678
00:50:23,565 --> 00:50:25,234
Copy. Increasing speed.

679
00:50:27,611 --> 00:50:28,611
Oh, shit!

680
00:50:32,324 --> 00:50:33,367
Why are they dead?

681
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:36,245
We broke the 300-foot ceiling,
and a SAM took us out.

682
00:50:36,328 --> 00:50:37,955
No. Why are they dead?

683
00:50:38,038 --> 00:50:40,433
I slowed down and didn't give her
a warning. It was my fault.

684
00:50:40,457 --> 00:50:42,352
Was there a reason
you didn't communicate with your team?

685
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:43,502
I was focusing on...

686
00:50:43,585 --> 00:50:45,505
One that their family will accept
at the funeral.

687
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,380
None, sir.

688
00:50:48,298 --> 00:50:51,343
Why didn't you anticipate the turn?
You were briefed on the terrain.

689
00:50:51,969 --> 00:50:54,680
Don't tell me. Tell it to his family.

690
00:51:00,102 --> 00:51:02,646
Hangman, ease up.
The canyon's getting tighter.

691
00:51:02,729 --> 00:51:05,315
Negative, Payback. Increase your speed.

692
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:10,279
- You're going too fast, man.
- No harm in being ahead of schedule.

693
00:51:12,489 --> 00:51:15,450
Damn it, slow down!
I can't stay on the course!

694
00:51:15,534 --> 00:51:18,120
You're gonna hit the wall!
Watch out! Watch out!

695
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:24,543
- What happened?
- I flew as fast as I could.

696
00:51:25,127 --> 00:51:26,712
Kind of like my ass depended on it.

697
00:51:26,795 --> 00:51:30,007
And you put your team in danger,
and your wing man's dead.

698
00:51:31,216 --> 00:51:32,759
They couldn't keep up.

699
00:51:38,891 --> 00:51:41,518
Rooster,
we're 20 seconds behind and dropping.

700
00:51:41,602 --> 00:51:44,188
We're fine. Speed is good.

701
00:51:44,271 --> 00:51:45,814
Increase to 500 knots.

702
00:51:45,898 --> 00:51:48,942
- Negative, Yale. Hold your speed.
- Rooster, we're late!

703
00:51:49,026 --> 00:51:51,820
We're alive.
We'll make up time in the straightaway.

704
00:51:51,904 --> 00:51:53,488
<i>We are not gonna make it.</i>

705
00:51:53,572 --> 00:51:56,575
Just trust me. Maintain your speed.
We can make it.

706
00:51:56,658 --> 00:51:57,784
Why are you dead?

707
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,081
You're team leader up there.
Why are you, why is your team dead?

708
00:52:03,165 --> 00:52:05,834
Sir, he's the only one
who made it to the target.

709
00:52:05,918 --> 00:52:07,127
A minute late.

710
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,506
He gave enemy aircraft time
to shoot him down.

711
00:52:10,589 --> 00:52:12,424
- He is dead.
- You don't know that.

712
00:52:12,508 --> 00:52:16,011
You're not flying fast enough.
You don't have a second to waste.

713
00:52:16,094 --> 00:52:17,346
We made it to the target.

714
00:52:17,429 --> 00:52:21,141
And superior enemy aircraft
intercepted you on your way out.

715
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:24,228
- Then it's a dogfight.
- Against fifth-generation fighters.

716
00:52:24,311 --> 00:52:26,897
- Yeah. We'd still have a chance.
- In an F-18.

717
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:29,483
It's not the plane, sir, it's the pilot.

718
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:30,692
Exactly!

719
00:52:37,824 --> 00:52:40,494
There's more than one way
to fly this mission.

720
00:52:40,577 --> 00:52:42,538
You really don't get it.

721
00:52:43,539 --> 00:52:46,208
On this mission,
a man flies like Maverick here,

722
00:52:46,291 --> 00:52:48,126
or a man does not come back.

723
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:51,213
No offense intended.

724
00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:53,590
Yet somehow you always manage.

725
00:52:55,133 --> 00:52:57,928
Look, I don't mean to criticize.
You're conservative, that's all.

726
00:52:58,011 --> 00:52:58,846
Lieutenant.

727
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:03,517
We're going into combat, son,
on a level no living pilot's ever seen.

728
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:06,186
Not even him.

729
00:53:08,188 --> 00:53:10,023
That's no time to be thinking
about the past.

730
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:16,154
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Rooster.

731
00:53:16,238 --> 00:53:18,883
I can't be the only one that knows
that Maverick flew with his old man.

732
00:53:18,907 --> 00:53:20,426
- That's enough.
- Or that Maverick was flying

733
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:22,410
- when his old man...
- Lieutenant, that's enough!

734
00:53:24,121 --> 00:53:25,998
- That's enough.
- You son of a bitch!

735
00:53:26,081 --> 00:53:27,081
Hey, come on!

736
00:53:27,124 --> 00:53:29,626
I'm cool, I'm cool. Hey, hey, hey.

737
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:30,544
That's enough.

738
00:53:30,627 --> 00:53:32,713
- He's not cut out for this mission.
- That's enough!

739
00:53:32,796 --> 00:53:34,047
You know it.

740
00:53:37,092 --> 00:53:38,093
You know I'm right.

741
00:53:44,558 --> 00:53:45,684
You're all dismissed.

742
00:54:49,998 --> 00:54:51,375
Maverick.

743
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:55,003
It's come back?

744
00:54:55,671 --> 00:54:57,130
No one knows.

745
00:54:59,299 --> 00:55:01,009
There's nothing else they can do.

746
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:04,888
Even speaking is painful now.

747
00:55:10,894 --> 00:55:12,604
Sarah, I'm so sorry.

748
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:33,292
Admiral.

749
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:46,054
How's my wing man?

750
00:55:57,691 --> 00:55:59,985
Please, don't worry about me.

751
00:56:00,944 --> 00:56:02,696
What can I do for you?

752
00:56:11,163 --> 00:56:12,247
All right.

753
00:56:15,083 --> 00:56:18,212
Well, Rooster's still angry with me
about what I did.

754
00:56:19,713 --> 00:56:22,466
I thought eventually
he would understand why.

755
00:56:24,718 --> 00:56:26,386
I hoped he'd forgive me.

756
00:56:34,811 --> 00:56:36,730
The mission is less than three weeks away.

757
00:56:37,314 --> 00:56:38,899
The kid's not ready.

758
00:56:47,241 --> 00:56:49,201
He doesn't want what I have to give.

759
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:51,662
Ice, please,

760
00:56:51,745 --> 00:56:54,081
don't ask me to send someone else to die.

761
00:56:54,164 --> 00:56:55,290
Please don't…

762
00:56:56,291 --> 00:56:57,876
Don't ask me to send him.

763
00:56:57,960 --> 00:56:59,545
Send me.

764
00:57:31,326 --> 00:57:32,995
I don't know how.

765
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:47,968
I'm not a teacher, Ice.

766
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,222
I'm a fighter pilot.

767
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:56,226
A naval aviator.

768
00:57:58,729 --> 00:58:00,814
It's not what I am.

769
00:58:02,065 --> 00:58:03,650
It's who I am.

770
00:58:05,402 --> 00:58:07,154
How do I teach that?

771
00:58:09,031 --> 00:58:11,658
Even if I could teach it,
it's not what Rooster wants.

772
00:58:12,618 --> 00:58:14,786
It's not what the navy wants.

773
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:17,206
That's why they canned me the last time.

774
00:58:20,042 --> 00:58:23,003
The only reason I'm here is you.

775
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:32,179
If I send him on this mission,

776
00:58:33,597 --> 00:58:35,474
he might never come home.

777
00:58:39,228 --> 00:58:40,854
And if I don't send him,

778
00:58:41,563 --> 00:58:43,398
he'll never forgive me.

779
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:48,570
Either way, I could lose him forever.

780
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:00,040
I know.

781
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:02,209
I know.

782
00:59:13,387 --> 00:59:17,015
The navy needs Maverick.

783
00:59:19,059 --> 00:59:22,604
The kid needs Maverick.

784
00:59:23,689 --> 00:59:25,941
That's why I fought for you.

785
00:59:27,943 --> 00:59:30,279
That's why you're still here.

786
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:40,080
Thank you, Ice,

787
00:59:40,747 --> 00:59:42,165
for everything.

788
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:48,547
One last thing.

789
00:59:49,173 --> 00:59:50,924
Who's the better pilot?

790
00:59:51,008 --> 00:59:52,301
You or me?

791
00:59:55,429 --> 00:59:58,015
This is a nice moment. Let's not ruin it.

792
01:00:38,388 --> 01:00:40,098
All right, all right.

793
01:00:50,317 --> 01:00:52,027
Touchdown!

794
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,681
Sir.

795
01:02:02,764 --> 01:02:04,808
- What is this?
- This is dogfight football.

796
01:02:04,892 --> 01:02:07,060
Offense and defense at the same time.

797
01:02:07,895 --> 01:02:08,896
Who's winning?

798
01:02:08,979 --> 01:02:11,899
I think they stopped keeping score
a while ago.

799
01:02:11,982 --> 01:02:15,027
This detachment still has some training
to complete, Captain.

800
01:02:15,110 --> 01:02:17,321
- Every available minute matters.
- Yes, sir.

801
01:02:17,404 --> 01:02:19,615
So why are we out here playing games?

802
01:02:19,698 --> 01:02:21,575
You said to create a team, sir.

803
01:02:23,076 --> 01:02:24,620
There's your team.

804
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:06,597
Should I go? Before Amelia gets back?

805
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,016
- She'll be at her friend's house tonight.
- Oh, good.

806
01:04:12,186 --> 01:04:13,854
You and Amelia, you seem…

807
01:04:16,607 --> 01:04:19,026
A lot closer than when I last saw you.

808
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:21,528
- Yeah. Yeah, we are.
- How do you manage?

809
01:04:23,697 --> 01:04:24,823
Well,

810
01:04:26,491 --> 01:04:29,703
you know, she always wanted more freedom
than I thought she was ready for.

811
01:04:30,454 --> 01:04:32,414
Where'd she get that from, I wonder?

812
01:04:36,043 --> 01:04:37,461
I guess I realized

813
01:04:38,378 --> 01:04:40,464
I also had to trust her.

814
01:04:42,049 --> 01:04:44,551
Let her make some
of her own mistakes sometimes.

815
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:48,722
Not an easy choice.

816
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,062
Is that what happened with Rooster?

817
01:04:58,732 --> 01:05:01,485
I pulled his papers
from the Naval Academy.

818
01:05:04,530 --> 01:05:06,240
Took years off his career.

819
01:05:12,538 --> 01:05:13,539
Why?

820
01:05:16,458 --> 01:05:19,962
His mother never wanted him to fly,
not after what happened to Goose.

821
01:05:22,756 --> 01:05:26,176
She made me promise before she died, so…

822
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:28,178
Does Rooster know that?

823
01:05:31,723 --> 01:05:34,768
He will always resent me for what I did.

824
01:05:36,770 --> 01:05:38,772
Why should he resent her too?

825
01:05:43,694 --> 01:05:45,404
Not an easy choice.

826
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:50,868
I was trying to be the father he lost.

827
01:05:53,954 --> 01:05:54,955
I just...

828
01:05:57,833 --> 01:06:00,002
I wish I would've done it better.

829
01:06:02,254 --> 01:06:05,090
But the truth is…

830
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:09,469
I didn't think he was ready.

831
01:06:13,056 --> 01:06:14,766
Is he ready now?

832
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:19,646
Mom, I'm home!

833
01:06:21,398 --> 01:06:23,817
I thought you were staying
at Karen's tonight.

834
01:06:23,901 --> 01:06:26,653
Karen's sick. And I've got homework to do.

835
01:06:26,737 --> 01:06:29,156
- I should go.
- You should go.

836
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:32,534
- Have you had dinner yet?
- Not yet. You want to go out?

837
01:06:32,618 --> 01:06:35,579
No, it's okay. I'll make you something.

838
01:06:35,662 --> 01:06:36,747
I'll be down in a sec!

839
01:06:37,623 --> 01:06:39,583
- Wait! Not that way.
- What?

840
01:06:41,251 --> 01:06:43,462
Look, I have an example to set.

841
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:46,006
I can't be bringing guys home
on a first date.

842
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,424
This is not our first date.

843
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:50,135
You know what I mean.

844
01:06:52,888 --> 01:06:53,889
Okay.

845
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:56,099
Fine.

846
01:06:57,142 --> 01:06:59,436
But this is the last time
I go out your window.

847
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,979
We'll see.

848
01:07:01,063 --> 01:07:02,481
No. No, I mean it.

849
01:07:03,232 --> 01:07:05,150
I'm never gonna leave you again.

850
01:07:07,152 --> 01:07:08,779
Oh, shut up.

851
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:10,739
Go on, get out of here.

852
01:07:24,294 --> 01:07:26,255
Just don't break her heart again.

853
01:07:38,225 --> 01:07:39,226
<i>Good morning.</i>

854
01:07:39,309 --> 01:07:41,436
The uranium enrichment plant
that is your target

855
01:07:41,520 --> 01:07:43,981
will be operational earlier than expected.

856
01:07:44,064 --> 01:07:47,192
Raw uranium will be delivered
to the plant in ten days' time.

857
01:07:47,901 --> 01:07:50,988
As a result, your mission
has been moved up one week

858
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:54,700
in order to avoid contaminating
the target valley with radiation.

859
01:07:54,783 --> 01:07:57,619
Sir, no one here has successfully flown
a low-level course.

860
01:07:57,703 --> 01:07:59,621
Nevertheless,
you've been ordered to move on.

861
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:01,832
Captain.

862
01:08:04,877 --> 01:08:07,254
We have one week left
to focus on phase two.

863
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:09,214
It's the most difficult stage
of the mission.

864
01:08:09,298 --> 01:08:11,091
It's a pop-up strike with a steep dive,

865
01:08:11,175 --> 01:08:14,094
requiring nothing less
than two consecutive miracles.

866
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:18,432
<i>Two pairs of F-18s will fly
in a welded wing formation.</i>

867
01:08:18,515 --> 01:08:19,765
<i>Teamwork.</i>

868
01:08:19,850 --> 01:08:22,352
<i>Precise coordination of these aircraft
is essential</i>

869
01:08:22,435 --> 01:08:25,147
<i>to both the mission's success
and your survival.</i>

870
01:08:25,229 --> 01:08:27,941
As you know,
the plant rests between two mountains.

871
01:08:28,066 --> 01:08:32,112
On final approach,
you'll invert directly into a steep dive.

872
01:08:33,113 --> 01:08:35,782
<i>This allows you to maintain
the lowest possible altitude</i>

873
01:08:36,992 --> 01:08:38,785
<i>and the only possible attack angle.</i>

874
01:08:42,538 --> 01:08:46,376
Your target is an impact point
less than three meters wide.

875
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:50,546
<i>The two-seat aircraft will paint
the target with a laser bull's-eye.</i>

876
01:08:52,006 --> 01:08:53,884
The first pair will breach the reactor

877
01:08:53,966 --> 01:08:57,638
by dropping a laser-guided bomb
on an exposed ventilation hatch.

878
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:59,932
This will create an opening
for the second pair.

879
01:09:00,765 --> 01:09:02,225
That's miracle number one.

880
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:05,979
<i>The second team</i>

881
01:09:06,063 --> 01:09:07,397
<i>will deliver the kill shot</i>

882
01:09:08,732 --> 01:09:10,526
and destroy the target.

883
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:13,111
That's miracle number two.

884
01:09:14,488 --> 01:09:16,740
<i>If either team misses the target…</i>

885
01:09:19,033 --> 01:09:19,910
That's a miss.

886
01:09:19,993 --> 01:09:21,995
- <i>…the mission is a failure.
</i>- Damn it!

887
01:09:22,703 --> 01:09:26,500
Egress is a steep high-G climb out
to avoid hitting this mountain.

888
01:09:29,377 --> 01:09:32,673
A steep climb at that speed,
you're pulling at least eight G's.

889
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:34,258
Nine, minimum.

890
01:09:34,341 --> 01:09:37,135
The stress limit
of the F-18's airframe is 7.5.

891
01:09:37,219 --> 01:09:38,595
That's the accepted limit.

892
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:40,889
To survive this mission,
you'll pull beyond that,

893
01:09:40,973 --> 01:09:43,642
even if it means bending your airframe.

894
01:09:44,977 --> 01:09:48,354
<i>You'll be pulling so hard,
you'll weigh close to 2,000 pounds,</i>

895
01:09:48,438 --> 01:09:51,316
<i>your skull crushing your spine,</i>

896
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:54,486
<i>your lungs imploding
like an elephant's sitting on your chest,</i>

897
01:09:54,570 --> 01:09:57,990
<i>fighting with everything you have
just to keep from blacking out.</i>

898
01:10:00,075 --> 01:10:02,578
And this is where you'll be
at your most vulnerable.

899
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:06,415
This is Coffin Corner.

900
01:10:06,498 --> 01:10:09,251
Assuming you avoid crashing
into this mountain,

901
01:10:09,334 --> 01:10:12,921
you'll climb straight up into enemy radar
while losing all of your airspeed.

902
01:10:13,505 --> 01:10:16,133
Within seconds,
you'll be fired upon by enemy SAMs.

903
01:10:17,634 --> 01:10:19,845
You've all faced sustained G's before,
but this...

904
01:10:20,596 --> 01:10:24,266
This is gonna take you and your aircraft
to the breaking point.

905
01:10:24,349 --> 01:10:27,102
Sir, is this even achievable?

906
01:10:27,186 --> 01:10:28,854
The answer to that question

907
01:10:29,438 --> 01:10:31,440
will come down to the pilot in the box.

908
01:10:41,366 --> 01:10:43,619
- Talk to me, Bob.
- We are 12 seconds late on target.

909
01:10:43,702 --> 01:10:46,413
- We got to move! We got to move!
- Copy. Try to stay with me.

910
01:10:50,417 --> 01:10:51,627
Wait, who's that?

911
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,296
<i>Blue Team, you've been spotted.</i>

912
01:10:54,379 --> 01:10:57,007
- Shit, it's Maverick.
- What the hell is he doing here?

913
01:10:57,090 --> 01:11:00,219
I'm a bandit on course to intercept.
Blue Team, what are you gonna do?

914
01:11:00,302 --> 01:11:03,514
He's 20 miles left. Ten o'clock.
700 knots closure.

915
01:11:03,597 --> 01:11:05,432
Your call. What do you want to do?

916
01:11:05,516 --> 01:11:08,227
Continue. We're close. Stay on target.

917
01:11:08,310 --> 01:11:11,522
- He's swinging around to the north!
- Stand by for pop-up.

918
01:11:11,605 --> 01:11:13,690
- Be ready on that laser, Bob.
- Copy. I'm on it.

919
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:17,653
Blue Team, bandit is still closing.

920
01:11:17,736 --> 01:11:18,904
Popping now.

921
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:27,204
Talk to me, Bob. Where's Maverick?

922
01:11:27,287 --> 01:11:29,331
He's five miles out. He's coming fast.

923
01:11:35,212 --> 01:11:37,714
- Target's in sight.
- Where's my laser, Bob?

924
01:11:38,549 --> 01:11:41,927
Dead eye! Dead eye! It's no good.
Sorry, I can't get a lock.

925
01:11:42,010 --> 01:11:43,846
We're out of time. I'm dropping blind.

926
01:11:47,099 --> 01:11:48,517
Damn it, missed!

927
01:12:00,112 --> 01:12:02,281
- That's tone.
- Maverick's got missile lock on us.

928
01:12:02,364 --> 01:12:03,407
Shit! We're dead.

929
01:12:04,241 --> 01:12:06,994
Blue Team, that's a fail.
Level out, Coyote.

930
01:12:09,663 --> 01:12:11,582
<i>Coyote? Do you copy?</i>

931
01:12:14,418 --> 01:12:15,878
<i>Coyote, come in.</i>

932
01:12:16,503 --> 01:12:18,422
<i>Coyote, level wings.</i>

933
01:12:18,505 --> 01:12:20,090
Oh, God. He's in G-LOC.

934
01:12:20,841 --> 01:12:23,385
<i>Coyote? Coyote?</i>

935
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:25,679
- He's gonna burn in!
- I'm going after him.

936
01:12:29,391 --> 01:12:31,685
Come on.
Give me tone, give me tone, give me tone.

937
01:12:32,227 --> 01:12:34,646
Snap out of it, Coyote. Come on! Come on!

938
01:12:37,691 --> 01:12:40,444
Come on, Coyote, come on. Come on!

939
01:12:40,527 --> 01:12:42,696
<i>- Damn it! Coyote!
- Pull up!</i>

940
01:12:42,779 --> 01:12:45,407
<i>- Coyote! Coyote!
- Pull up! Pull up!</i>

941
01:12:50,621 --> 01:12:52,414
Coyote, you okay?

942
01:12:53,457 --> 01:12:55,209
I'm okay. I'm good.

943
01:12:56,210 --> 01:12:59,046
Good. Good. That's enough for today.

944
01:13:01,256 --> 01:13:02,466
That was close.

945
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:04,050
Too close.

946
01:13:04,843 --> 01:13:07,012
Bird strike! Bird strike!

947
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:08,222
Bird strike!

948
01:13:11,558 --> 01:13:14,228
- Phoenix, left engine's on fire!
- Climbing.

949
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,732
Throttling back.
Shutting off fuel to left engine.

950
01:13:18,815 --> 01:13:20,442
Extinguishing fire.

951
01:13:22,819 --> 01:13:23,820
Right engine is out!

952
01:13:23,904 --> 01:13:25,584
It's still spinning. Trying to restart it.

953
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:30,702
- Phoenix, it's on fire. Don't start it.
- Throttling up.

954
01:13:32,287 --> 01:13:33,539
Oh, my God.

955
01:13:36,917 --> 01:13:39,336
- We're on fire! We're on fire!
- Damn it!

956
01:13:39,419 --> 01:13:42,172
- <i>Engine fire. Right.
</i>- Extinguishing right engine.

957
01:13:45,467 --> 01:13:47,386
Phoenix, Bob, punch out, punch out!

958
01:13:47,469 --> 01:13:49,680
Warning lights everywhere!
Hydraulic failure!

959
01:13:49,763 --> 01:13:51,473
- <i>Flight controls.
</i>- I can't control it.

960
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:54,309
We're going down, Phoenix!
We're going in! We're going in!

961
01:13:54,393 --> 01:13:57,020
You can't save it. Eject, eject!

962
01:13:57,104 --> 01:13:58,272
Eject, eject, eject!

963
01:13:58,355 --> 01:14:01,191
<i>Altitude. Altitude.</i>

964
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:25,716
They'll keep Phoenix and Bob
in the hospital overnight for observation.

965
01:14:25,799 --> 01:14:27,301
They're gonna be okay.

966
01:14:31,388 --> 01:14:32,723
That's good.

967
01:14:35,976 --> 01:14:37,811
I've never lost a wing man.

968
01:14:38,562 --> 01:14:39,771
You're lucky.

969
01:14:40,355 --> 01:14:42,191
Fly long enough, it'll happen.

970
01:14:44,985 --> 01:14:46,653
There will be others.

971
01:14:49,406 --> 01:14:51,408
Easy for you to say. No wife.

972
01:14:53,368 --> 01:14:54,578
No kids.

973
01:14:55,412 --> 01:14:57,915
Nobody to mourn you when you burn in.

974
01:15:01,168 --> 01:15:02,503
Go home.

975
01:15:03,629 --> 01:15:05,088
Just get some sleep.

976
01:15:07,633 --> 01:15:09,843
Why'd you pull my papers at the Academy?

977
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:11,553
Why did you stand in my way?

978
01:15:14,139 --> 01:15:15,474
You weren't ready.

979
01:15:15,557 --> 01:15:16,850
Ready for what?

980
01:15:18,519 --> 01:15:20,312
- Ready to fly like you?
- No.

981
01:15:20,395 --> 01:15:22,022
Ready to forget the book.

982
01:15:22,105 --> 01:15:24,816
Trust your instincts.
Don't think, just do.

983
01:15:24,900 --> 01:15:27,569
You think up there, you're dead.
Believe me.

984
01:15:28,862 --> 01:15:30,531
My dad believed in you.

985
01:15:33,242 --> 01:15:35,702
I'm not gonna make the same mistake.

986
01:15:41,375 --> 01:15:42,876
Maverick.

987
01:15:53,428 --> 01:15:56,306
Ready, aim, fire.

988
01:16:01,061 --> 01:16:02,229
Ready,

989
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:03,772
aim,

990
01:16:04,314 --> 01:16:05,649
fire.

991
01:16:15,701 --> 01:16:16,910
Ready,

992
01:16:17,953 --> 01:16:19,329
aim,

993
01:16:19,413 --> 01:16:20,706
fire.

994
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:56,658
<i>I can only imagine
what you must be feeling right now.</i>

995
01:16:57,743 --> 01:16:59,995
Take some time. Whatever you need.

996
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:03,683
I appreciate that, sir,
but there is no time. The mission...

997
01:17:03,707 --> 01:17:05,792
I'll be taking over the training
from here.

998
01:17:06,793 --> 01:17:07,794
Sir?

999
01:17:09,213 --> 01:17:11,053
We both know you didn't want this job,
Captain.

1000
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:13,485
- Sir, they're not ready.
- It was your job to get them ready.

1001
01:17:13,509 --> 01:17:16,970
Sir, they have to believe
that this mission can be flown.

1002
01:17:17,054 --> 01:17:19,806
And all you've managed to do
is teach them that it can't.

1003
01:17:20,641 --> 01:17:22,976
- Sir...
- You're grounded, Captain.

1004
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,561
Permanently.

1005
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:29,733
- Sir...
- That is all.

1006
01:17:48,252 --> 01:17:49,253
I heard.

1007
01:17:51,547 --> 01:17:52,714
I'm sorry.

1008
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,259
What are you gonna do?

1009
01:17:56,426 --> 01:17:57,719
Ice is gone.

1010
01:18:00,264 --> 01:18:01,974
What choice do I have?

1011
01:18:03,183 --> 01:18:05,769
You'll have to find a way back
on your own.

1012
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:07,104
No, Penny.

1013
01:18:08,897 --> 01:18:10,232
I'm out.

1014
01:18:11,984 --> 01:18:13,235
This is over.

1015
01:18:13,777 --> 01:18:14,778
Pete.

1016
01:18:14,862 --> 01:18:17,322
If you lost your wing man up there,

1017
01:18:18,073 --> 01:18:19,783
you'd keep fighting.

1018
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:21,159
You wouldn't just give up.

1019
01:18:21,952 --> 01:18:23,912
Those are your pilots.

1020
01:18:25,205 --> 01:18:27,374
If anything happens to them,

1021
01:18:28,208 --> 01:18:30,252
you'll never forgive yourself.

1022
01:18:34,298 --> 01:18:36,175
I don't know what to do.

1023
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,763
But you'll find a way.

1024
01:18:44,183 --> 01:18:45,392
I know you will.

1025
01:18:47,561 --> 01:18:49,938
<i>Captain Mitchell
is no longer your instructor.</i>

1026
01:18:50,022 --> 01:18:52,441
And as of today,
there are new mission parameters.

1027
01:18:53,192 --> 01:18:55,068
Time to target is now four minutes.

1028
01:18:55,819 --> 01:18:58,363
You'll be entering the valley level
at reduced speed.

1029
01:18:58,447 --> 01:19:01,408
Not to exceed 420 knots.

1030
01:19:01,491 --> 01:19:04,286
Sir, won't we be giving their planes
time to intercept?

1031
01:19:04,369 --> 01:19:06,931
Well, Lieutenant, you have
a fighting chance against enemy aircraft.

1032
01:19:06,955 --> 01:19:10,042
What are the odds of surviving
a head-on collision with a mountain?

1033
01:19:10,125 --> 01:19:12,711
You'll be attacking the target
from a higher altitude,

1034
01:19:12,794 --> 01:19:14,004
level with the north wall.

1035
01:19:14,087 --> 01:19:16,507
Gonna be a little harder
to keep your lase on target,

1036
01:19:16,590 --> 01:19:18,509
but you will avoid the high-G climb out.

1037
01:19:18,592 --> 01:19:20,802
We'll be sitting ducks for enemy missiles.

1038
01:19:26,225 --> 01:19:27,476
Who the hell is that?

1039
01:19:29,269 --> 01:19:32,105
<i>Maverick to Range Control.
Entering Point Alpha.</i>

1040
01:19:32,189 --> 01:19:33,857
Confirm green range.

1041
01:19:34,483 --> 01:19:36,818
<i>Maverick, Range Control,</i>

1042
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:38,529
<i>green range is confirmed.</i>

1043
01:19:38,612 --> 01:19:41,990
<i>I don't see an event scheduled
for you, sir.</i>

1044
01:19:42,074 --> 01:19:43,283
<i>Well, I'm going anyway.</i>

1045
01:19:43,951 --> 01:19:45,202
Nice.

1046
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:48,997
<i>Setting time to target:
Two minutes 15 seconds.</i>

1047
01:19:49,081 --> 01:19:50,832
2:15? That's impossible.

1048
01:19:50,916 --> 01:19:53,460
Final attack point. Maverick's inbound.

1049
01:21:31,141 --> 01:21:34,353
Popping in three, two, one.

1050
01:22:00,838 --> 01:22:02,214
Bombs away.

1051
01:22:19,690 --> 01:22:21,608
Bull's-eye! Holy shit!

1052
01:22:22,901 --> 01:22:24,486
Yes.

1053
01:22:27,364 --> 01:22:28,490
Damn.

1054
01:22:41,253 --> 01:22:43,463
You have put me
in a difficult position, Captain.

1055
01:22:44,381 --> 01:22:48,135
On the one hand, you have demonstrated
that this mission can be flown.

1056
01:22:48,218 --> 01:22:50,304
Perhaps the only way it can be survived.

1057
01:22:51,722 --> 01:22:53,432
On the other hand,

1058
01:22:53,515 --> 01:22:56,435
you did it by stealing
a multimillion-dollar military aircraft

1059
01:22:56,518 --> 01:22:59,396
and flying it in such a manner
that it may never be airworthy again.

1060
01:23:00,814 --> 01:23:03,108
Iceman is no longer here to protect you.

1061
01:23:03,942 --> 01:23:06,570
I have everything I need
to have you court-martialed

1062
01:23:06,653 --> 01:23:08,405
and dishonorably discharged.

1063
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:10,574
So what do I do?

1064
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:14,703
Risk the lives of my pilots
and perhaps the success of this mission

1065
01:23:16,205 --> 01:23:17,206
or…

1066
01:23:18,749 --> 01:23:20,209
Risk my career

1067
01:23:21,293 --> 01:23:23,045
by appointing you team leader?

1068
01:23:26,381 --> 01:23:27,382
Sir...

1069
01:23:27,466 --> 01:23:31,094
I think the admiral's asking
a rhetorical question, Captain.

1070
01:25:11,945 --> 01:25:13,530
Talk to me, Goose.

1071
01:25:16,867 --> 01:25:18,368
Captain Mitchell!

1072
01:25:25,334 --> 01:25:27,002
You're where you belong.

1073
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:33,425
Make us proud.

1074
01:25:59,535 --> 01:26:01,662
It has been an honor flying with you.

1075
01:26:02,746 --> 01:26:06,208
Each one of you represents
the best of the best.

1076
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:09,711
This is a very specific mission.

1077
01:26:10,546 --> 01:26:13,841
My choice is a reflection of that
and nothing more.

1078
01:26:13,924 --> 01:26:15,759
Choose your two Foxtrot teams.

1079
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,971
Payback and Fanboy.

1080
01:26:20,055 --> 01:26:21,390
Phoenix and Bob.

1081
01:26:25,686 --> 01:26:26,979
And your wing man.

1082
01:26:31,775 --> 01:26:32,776
Rooster.

1083
01:26:37,322 --> 01:26:39,616
The rest of you will stand by
on the carrier

1084
01:26:39,700 --> 01:26:42,578
for any reserve role that's required.

1085
01:26:43,453 --> 01:26:44,621
Dismissed.

1086
01:26:52,421 --> 01:26:55,257
Your target is a clear and present threat.

1087
01:26:56,758 --> 01:27:00,596
<i>A secret uranium enrichment site
under rogue state control.</i>

1088
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:02,598
<i>It's an underground bunker,</i>

1089
01:27:02,681 --> 01:27:04,474
tucked between these two mountains.

1090
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:09,730
<i>Your route of ingress is heavily defended
by surface-to-air missiles</i>

1091
01:27:09,813 --> 01:27:12,316
<i>backed up by fifth-generation fighters.</i>

1092
01:27:12,399 --> 01:27:15,152
Once your F-18 strike team
crosses the border,

1093
01:27:15,235 --> 01:27:17,237
Tomahawk missiles from the USS <i>Leyte Gulf</i>

1094
01:27:17,321 --> 01:27:20,949
will launch a synchronized strike
on the enemy's airfield here.

1095
01:27:22,242 --> 01:27:24,453
<i>This will knock out their runway.</i>

1096
01:27:26,246 --> 01:27:29,625
<i>But you'll have to contend with
any planes already in the air.</i>

1097
01:27:29,708 --> 01:27:32,544
The moment those Tomahawks hit,
the enemy will know you're coming.

1098
01:27:33,754 --> 01:27:37,799
Your time to target
will be two minutes and 30 seconds.

1099
01:27:39,468 --> 01:27:41,470
<i>Any longer than that,
and you will be exposed</i>

1100
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:44,181
<i>to any aircraft
the Tomahawks may have missed.</i>

1101
01:27:47,559 --> 01:27:49,978
This is what you've all been training for.

1102
01:27:51,939 --> 01:27:53,440
Come home safely.

1103
01:28:08,121 --> 01:28:09,873
You give 'em hell!

1104
01:28:22,511 --> 01:28:23,512
Sir.

1105
01:28:24,012 --> 01:28:25,013
Sir?

1106
01:28:27,266 --> 01:28:28,267
I…

1107
01:28:31,186 --> 01:28:32,813
I just want to say...

1108
01:28:41,905 --> 01:28:43,240
We'll talk

1109
01:28:44,741 --> 01:28:46,118
when we get back.

1110
01:28:52,207 --> 01:28:54,001
Hey, Bradley! Bradley!

1111
01:28:55,127 --> 01:28:56,128
Hey.

1112
01:28:59,631 --> 01:29:01,049
You got this.

1113
01:29:09,474 --> 01:29:10,475
<i>Maverick.</i>

1114
01:29:12,728 --> 01:29:13,728
<i>Maverick?</i>

1115
01:29:15,522 --> 01:29:17,441
Hey, you with me?

1116
01:29:19,026 --> 01:29:20,861
I don't like that look, Mav.

1117
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:25,199
It's the only one I got.

1118
01:29:29,828 --> 01:29:31,163
Thank you.

1119
01:29:32,664 --> 01:29:34,750
If I don't see you again, Hondo,

1120
01:29:34,833 --> 01:29:36,168
thank you.

1121
01:29:43,926 --> 01:29:45,761
It's been an honor, Captain.

1122
01:30:18,919 --> 01:30:21,964
Dagger One, up and ready on Catapult One.

1123
01:30:22,047 --> 01:30:24,174
Dagger Spare standing by.

1124
01:30:24,258 --> 01:30:26,051
Dagger Four, up and ready.

1125
01:30:26,134 --> 01:30:27,636
Dagger Three, up and ready.

1126
01:30:27,719 --> 01:30:29,847
Dagger Two, up and ready.

1127
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:33,684
Support assets airborne.
Strike package ready.

1128
01:30:33,767 --> 01:30:35,644
Standing by for launch decision.

1129
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:37,271
Send them.

1130
01:30:57,916 --> 01:30:59,209
Dagger Two away.

1131
01:31:00,210 --> 01:31:02,171
Dagger Three away.

1132
01:31:02,754 --> 01:31:04,173
Dagger Four away.

1133
01:31:15,184 --> 01:31:17,603
Comanche, Dagger One. Standby check in.

1134
01:31:18,979 --> 01:31:20,439
<i>Comanche 11, set.</i>

1135
01:31:20,522 --> 01:31:22,774
Picture clean. Recommend Dagger continue.

1136
01:31:22,858 --> 01:31:24,818
Copy. Daggers descending below radar.

1137
01:31:44,713 --> 01:31:47,382
Daggers now below radar.
Switching to E-2 picture.

1138
01:31:55,891 --> 01:31:58,477
Here we go. Enemy territory up ahead.

1139
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:01,522
Feet dry in 60 seconds.
Comanche, Dagger One. Picture.

1140
01:32:01,605 --> 01:32:04,399
Comanche. Picture clean.
Decision is yours.

1141
01:32:04,483 --> 01:32:05,776
Copy.

1142
01:32:14,076 --> 01:32:15,202
Dagger attack.

1143
01:32:20,499 --> 01:32:21,792
Tomahawks airborne.

1144
01:32:21,875 --> 01:32:23,961
No turning back now.

1145
01:32:29,716 --> 01:32:31,760
Daggers, assume attack formation.

1146
01:32:40,853 --> 01:32:42,813
<i>Daggers set. Proceeding to target.</i>

1147
01:32:42,896 --> 01:32:47,442
Two minutes and 30 seconds
in three, two, one, mark.

1148
01:32:47,526 --> 01:32:48,861
- Two mark.
- Three mark.

1149
01:32:48,944 --> 01:32:49,944
Four mark.

1150
01:32:54,783 --> 01:32:55,783
Going in.

1151
01:33:11,341 --> 01:33:13,552
First SAM site overhead.

1152
01:33:17,931 --> 01:33:19,433
Looks like we're clear on radar, Mav.

1153
01:33:19,516 --> 01:33:21,268
Let's not take it for granted.

1154
01:33:24,771 --> 01:33:26,982
More SAMs! Three o'clock high!

1155
01:33:29,318 --> 01:33:31,695
- We got two minutes to target.
<i>- Copy.</i>

1156
01:33:31,778 --> 01:33:34,114
We're a few seconds behind, Rooster.
We got to move.

1157
01:33:35,657 --> 01:33:38,535
Thirty seconds to Tomahawk impact
on enemy airstrip.

1158
01:33:46,919 --> 01:33:47,920
Dagger, Comanche.

1159
01:33:48,003 --> 01:33:50,231
We're picking up two bandits.
Single group, two contacts.

1160
01:33:50,255 --> 01:33:53,008
- Where the hell'd they come from?
- Long-range patrol?

1161
01:33:58,013 --> 01:33:59,473
Comanche, what's their heading?

1162
01:33:59,556 --> 01:34:02,059
<i>Bull's-eye 090, 50, tacked southwest.</i>

1163
01:34:02,142 --> 01:34:04,287
They're headed away from us.
They don't know we're here.

1164
01:34:04,311 --> 01:34:06,271
The second those Tomahawks
hit the air base,

1165
01:34:06,355 --> 01:34:08,524
those bandits are gonna move
to defend the target.

1166
01:34:08,607 --> 01:34:11,193
We have to get there before they do.
Increase speed.

1167
01:34:12,569 --> 01:34:14,863
We got you, Mav. Don't wait for me.

1168
01:34:20,827 --> 01:34:23,830
Sir, Daggers Two and Four
are behind schedule.

1169
01:34:23,914 --> 01:34:25,916
Time to target, one minute 20.

1170
01:34:27,125 --> 01:34:29,294
Tomahawk impact in three, two…

1171
01:34:33,674 --> 01:34:36,134
Impact. Enemy runway is destroyed.

1172
01:34:36,927 --> 01:34:38,595
They know we're coming now.

1173
01:34:41,974 --> 01:34:44,309
Bandits are switching course
to defend the target.

1174
01:34:44,393 --> 01:34:45,519
Rooster, where are you?

1175
01:34:47,229 --> 01:34:48,981
<i>Come on, Rooster. Bandits inbound.</i>

1176
01:34:49,064 --> 01:34:51,233
We got to make up time now.
Let's turn and burn.

1177
01:34:59,199 --> 01:35:00,242
Heads up, Phoenix.

1178
01:35:10,043 --> 01:35:14,423
Sir, bandits are two minutes from target.
Daggers are one minute from target.

1179
01:35:14,506 --> 01:35:16,800
Come on, Rooster. Move it or lose it.

1180
01:35:19,052 --> 01:35:21,889
Guys, we're falling behind.
We really got to move.

1181
01:35:21,972 --> 01:35:23,765
If we don't increase our speed right now,

1182
01:35:23,849 --> 01:35:26,643
those bandits are gonna be waiting for us
when we reach the target.

1183
01:35:28,437 --> 01:35:29,646
Talk to me, Dad.

1184
01:35:30,981 --> 01:35:32,482
Come on, kid, you can do it.

1185
01:35:32,566 --> 01:35:34,610
Don't think, just do.

1186
01:35:43,118 --> 01:35:44,578
Jesus, Rooster, not that fast!

1187
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:47,206
That's it, kid, that's it.
All right, let's go.

1188
01:35:51,293 --> 01:35:53,045
Damn, Rooster, take it easy.

1189
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:56,340
Sir, Dagger Two is reengaging.

1190
01:35:56,423 --> 01:35:58,800
All right, now hit your target
and come home.

1191
01:36:03,222 --> 01:36:05,933
Thirty seconds to target.
Bob, check your laser.

1192
01:36:06,016 --> 01:36:09,520
Air-to-ground check complete.
Laser code verified, 1688.

1193
01:36:09,603 --> 01:36:10,687
<i>Laser is a go!</i>

1194
01:36:13,023 --> 01:36:14,399
Watch your heads.

1195
01:36:16,151 --> 01:36:17,611
Holy shit!

1196
01:36:17,694 --> 01:36:19,613
- Payback, you with me?
- Right behind you.

1197
01:36:20,697 --> 01:36:22,533
Phoenix, stand by for pop-up strike.

1198
01:36:22,616 --> 01:36:23,951
Dagger Three in position.

1199
01:36:24,618 --> 01:36:27,287
Popping in three, two, one.

1200
01:36:55,315 --> 01:36:57,568
- Get me eyes on that target, Bob.
- Dagger Three.

1201
01:36:58,443 --> 01:36:59,736
<i>Stand by, Mav.</i>

1202
01:36:59,820 --> 01:37:02,239
- Come on, Bob, come on.
- Stand by.

1203
01:37:02,823 --> 01:37:05,576
- I've got it. Captured!
- Target acquired. Bombs away.

1204
01:37:26,638 --> 01:37:30,017
We've got impact!
Check, direct hit! Direct hit!

1205
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:31,935
That's miracle number one.

1206
01:37:32,603 --> 01:37:34,021
Dagger Two, status.

1207
01:37:34,104 --> 01:37:35,606
Almost there, Mav. Almost there.

1208
01:37:38,275 --> 01:37:39,860
Fanboy, where's my laser?

1209
01:37:40,444 --> 01:37:42,571
Rooster, there's something wrong
with this laser.

1210
01:37:42,654 --> 01:37:44,281
Shit! Dead eye, dead eye, dead eye!

1211
01:37:44,364 --> 01:37:46,700
Come on, guys, we're running out of time.
Get it online!

1212
01:37:46,783 --> 01:37:48,243
<i>- I'm trying!
- Come on, Fanboy!</i>

1213
01:37:48,327 --> 01:37:49,995
Nearly there! Nearly there!

1214
01:37:58,879 --> 01:38:01,524
- Come on, Fanboy, get it online.
- There's no time. I'm dropping blind.

1215
01:38:01,548 --> 01:38:03,759
- Rooster, I got this!
- No time. Pull up.

1216
01:38:03,842 --> 01:38:05,219
- Wait!
- Bombs away! Bombs away!

1217
01:38:18,774 --> 01:38:20,609
Bull's-eye, bull's-eye, bull's-eye!

1218
01:38:24,571 --> 01:38:25,864
Miracle number two.

1219
01:38:25,948 --> 01:38:27,574
Now they're in Coffin Corner.

1220
01:38:27,658 --> 01:38:29,743
We're not out of this yet.

1221
01:38:31,578 --> 01:38:32,996
Here it comes.

1222
01:38:36,041 --> 01:38:38,210
Radar warning! Smoke in the air.
Phoenix, break right.

1223
01:38:38,293 --> 01:38:40,587
Emergency jettison.
Dagger Three defending.

1224
01:38:40,671 --> 01:38:42,464
Here comes another one!

1225
01:38:42,548 --> 01:38:44,216
Dagger One defending.

1226
01:38:50,514 --> 01:38:51,598
Rooster, status.

1227
01:38:59,815 --> 01:39:00,816
Oh, my God.

1228
01:39:03,026 --> 01:39:04,444
Smoke in the air!

1229
01:39:05,821 --> 01:39:07,698
- Break right, Payback!
- Breaking right.

1230
01:39:09,116 --> 01:39:10,951
Oh, my God, here they come!

1231
01:39:11,034 --> 01:39:12,411
SAM on your six, Rooster!

1232
01:39:13,871 --> 01:39:15,247
Deploying countermeasures.

1233
01:39:18,083 --> 01:39:19,585
Negative contact.

1234
01:39:21,628 --> 01:39:22,713
Dagger One defending.

1235
01:39:24,131 --> 01:39:27,009
- Talk to me, Bob.
- Break right, Phoenix! Break right! Mav!

1236
01:39:27,092 --> 01:39:28,594
<i>Nine o'clock! Nine o'clock!</i>

1237
01:39:29,428 --> 01:39:31,388
Rooster, two more on your six.

1238
01:39:31,471 --> 01:39:32,931
Dagger Two, defending.

1239
01:39:37,519 --> 01:39:39,855
- Payback, SAM on your nose.
- Dagger Four defending.

1240
01:39:39,938 --> 01:39:41,583
- Rooster, tally, seven o'clock!
- Talk to me, Bob!

1241
01:39:41,607 --> 01:39:43,001
- On our six!
- Dagger Two defending.

1242
01:39:43,025 --> 01:39:44,693
- Phoenix, break right!
- <i>I see it!</i>

1243
01:39:52,075 --> 01:39:53,452
Dagger Two defending.

1244
01:39:54,828 --> 01:39:55,996
Shit, I'm out of flares!

1245
01:39:56,079 --> 01:39:58,415
Rooster, evade, evade!

1246
01:39:58,498 --> 01:40:00,751
I can't shake 'em!
They're on me! They're on me!

1247
01:40:10,886 --> 01:40:12,513
Mav! No!

1248
01:40:14,515 --> 01:40:18,018
Dagger One is hit!
I repeat, Dagger One is hit!

1249
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:19,603
<i>Maverick is down.</i>

1250
01:40:19,686 --> 01:40:20,854
<i>Dagger One, status.</i>

1251
01:40:20,938 --> 01:40:22,564
<i>Status!</i>

1252
01:40:22,648 --> 01:40:24,775
<i>Anyone see him? Does anyone see him?</i>

1253
01:40:24,858 --> 01:40:27,069
- Dagger One, come in!
- I didn't see a parachute.

1254
01:40:27,194 --> 01:40:28,820
We have to circle back.

1255
01:40:28,904 --> 01:40:31,406
Comanche. Bandits inbound.
Single group, hot.

1256
01:40:31,490 --> 01:40:32,991
Recommend Dagger flow south.

1257
01:40:33,825 --> 01:40:35,827
<i>One minute to intercept.</i>

1258
01:40:39,081 --> 01:40:40,666
Get 'em back to the carrier now.

1259
01:40:40,749 --> 01:40:43,252
All Daggers flow to ECP.
You have bandits headed for you.

1260
01:40:43,335 --> 01:40:44,378
What about Maverick?

1261
01:40:44,461 --> 01:40:47,464
Tell him there's nothing he can do
for Maverick, not in a goddamn F-18.

1262
01:40:47,548 --> 01:40:50,384
Dagger Spare request permission
to launch and fly air cover.

1263
01:40:52,678 --> 01:40:53,679
Negative, Spare.

1264
01:40:54,847 --> 01:40:57,450
- Launch search and rescue.
- Negative. Not with bandits in the air.

1265
01:40:57,474 --> 01:41:01,019
- But, sir, Maverick is still out there.
- We are not losing anyone else today.

1266
01:41:02,980 --> 01:41:04,481
Get 'em home now.

1267
01:41:04,565 --> 01:41:07,109
Dagger, you are not to engage.

1268
01:41:07,192 --> 01:41:09,278
Repeat, do not engage.

1269
01:41:09,361 --> 01:41:12,447
<i>Dagger Two, return to carrier.
Acknowledge.</i>

1270
01:41:12,531 --> 01:41:13,532
<i>Acknowledge.</i>

1271
01:41:13,615 --> 01:41:17,077
Rooster, those bandits are closing.
We can't go back.

1272
01:41:17,160 --> 01:41:20,038
Rooster, he's gone.

1273
01:41:21,707 --> 01:41:23,208
<i>Maverick's gone.</i>

1274
01:42:53,674 --> 01:42:54,675
Oh, no, no.

1275
01:43:01,431 --> 01:43:02,891
<i>Dagger Two is hit.</i>

1276
01:43:04,059 --> 01:43:05,143
Dagger Two is hit.

1277
01:43:06,728 --> 01:43:08,105
Dagger Two, come in.

1278
01:43:09,815 --> 01:43:11,650
Dagger Two, do you copy?

1279
01:43:12,317 --> 01:43:14,611
<i>Dagger Two, come in.</i>

1280
01:43:39,887 --> 01:43:41,096
You all right?

1281
01:43:41,180 --> 01:43:42,764
Yeah, I'm good. You all right?

1282
01:43:45,350 --> 01:43:46,435
What the hell?

1283
01:43:46,518 --> 01:43:48,896
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

1284
01:43:48,979 --> 01:43:51,416
You think I took that missile
so you could be down here with me?

1285
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:53,275
You should be back on the carrier by now!

1286
01:43:53,358 --> 01:43:55,068
I saved your life!

1287
01:43:55,194 --> 01:43:58,280
I saved your life. That's the whole point.

1288
01:43:58,363 --> 01:44:00,157
What the hell were you even thinking?

1289
01:44:00,240 --> 01:44:02,284
You told me not to think!

1290
01:44:19,009 --> 01:44:20,093
Well,

1291
01:44:21,428 --> 01:44:22,804
it's good to see you.

1292
01:44:25,224 --> 01:44:26,850
It's good to see you too.

1293
01:44:30,896 --> 01:44:32,356
So what's the plan?

1294
01:44:43,325 --> 01:44:44,701
You're not serious.

1295
01:45:00,217 --> 01:45:01,844
You've got to be shitting me.

1296
01:45:03,846 --> 01:45:04,888
An F-14?

1297
01:45:05,597 --> 01:45:07,391
I shot down three MiGs in one of those.

1298
01:45:07,474 --> 01:45:09,893
We don't even know
if that bag of ass can fly.

1299
01:45:12,604 --> 01:45:14,565
- Let's find out.
- Mav!

1300
01:45:16,441 --> 01:45:17,442
Okay.

1301
01:45:26,994 --> 01:45:28,996
- There's guys up there, Mav.
- Yeah.

1302
01:45:30,247 --> 01:45:32,165
- There's more over there.
- Okay.

1303
01:45:33,458 --> 01:45:35,627
- Let's start running.
- Yeah, run. Run.

1304
01:45:45,095 --> 01:45:47,472
Once I give you the signal for air,

1305
01:45:48,182 --> 01:45:50,893
you're gonna flip this switch
until the needle gets to 120.

1306
01:45:50,976 --> 01:45:52,144
When the engine starts,

1307
01:45:52,227 --> 01:45:54,730
you got to pull out the pins
and disconnect everything.

1308
01:45:54,813 --> 01:45:56,481
- You understand?
- Yeah.

1309
01:45:58,650 --> 01:45:59,651
Yes!

1310
01:46:01,528 --> 01:46:03,697
Once I'm up, stow the ladder.

1311
01:46:11,622 --> 01:46:13,665
Okay. Wow.

1312
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:16,668
It's been a minute, huh, Mav?

1313
01:46:45,531 --> 01:46:48,492
Oh, my God. This thing is so old.

1314
01:46:49,493 --> 01:46:50,494
All right.

1315
01:46:55,582 --> 01:46:57,125
- Canopy?
- Clear.

1316
01:47:15,352 --> 01:47:17,229
Both runways are cratered.

1317
01:47:17,938 --> 01:47:20,023
How we gonna get this museum piece
in the air?

1318
01:47:30,409 --> 01:47:31,827
Why are the wings coming out, Mav?

1319
01:47:38,500 --> 01:47:41,211
Mav, this is a taxiway, not a runway.

1320
01:47:41,795 --> 01:47:44,715
This is a very short taxiway, Mav.

1321
01:47:44,798 --> 01:47:46,008
Just hang on.

1322
01:47:47,342 --> 01:47:48,719
Holy shit!

1323
01:47:54,766 --> 01:47:56,059
Come on, come on, come on.

1324
01:47:56,143 --> 01:47:57,186
Needle's alive.

1325
01:48:00,606 --> 01:48:02,858
- Mav?
- That's it. Come on, come on!

1326
01:48:02,941 --> 01:48:03,984
All right.

1327
01:48:04,902 --> 01:48:06,904
- Mav!
- Here we go.

1328
01:48:08,363 --> 01:48:09,781
Holy shit.

1329
01:48:23,545 --> 01:48:26,632
Sir, we're receiving a signal
from Rooster's ESAT.

1330
01:48:26,715 --> 01:48:28,634
But there seems to be a malfunction.

1331
01:48:28,717 --> 01:48:30,052
- Have you lost him?
- No, sir.

1332
01:48:31,053 --> 01:48:32,513
He's supersonic.

1333
01:48:33,138 --> 01:48:34,223
He's airborne.

1334
01:48:35,474 --> 01:48:37,059
- In what?
- Sir.

1335
01:48:37,768 --> 01:48:42,022
Over watch reports an F-14 Tomcat is
airborne and on course for our position.

1336
01:48:42,940 --> 01:48:45,484
Can't be. It can't be!

1337
01:48:47,194 --> 01:48:48,195
Maverick.

1338
01:48:50,447 --> 01:48:52,783
Okay, Rooster,
get us in touch with the boat.

1339
01:48:52,866 --> 01:48:54,326
I'm working on it.

1340
01:48:54,409 --> 01:48:57,829
Radio's out. No radar.
Everything's dead back here.

1341
01:48:58,497 --> 01:49:00,874
- What do I do? Talk me through it.
- Okay, first the radio.

1342
01:49:00,958 --> 01:49:02,125
Throw the…

1343
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:05,170
The UHF-2 circuit breaker.

1344
01:49:05,254 --> 01:49:06,255
Try that.

1345
01:49:06,839 --> 01:49:09,299
There's 300 breakers back here.
Anything more specific?

1346
01:49:09,383 --> 01:49:11,343
I don't know.
That was your dad's department.

1347
01:49:11,426 --> 01:49:12,886
I'll figure it out.

1348
01:49:16,223 --> 01:49:18,225
Mav, tally two, 5:00 low.

1349
01:49:23,730 --> 01:49:24,857
What do we do?

1350
01:49:25,524 --> 01:49:27,651
Okay, listen. Just be cool.

1351
01:49:27,734 --> 01:49:29,695
If they knew who we were,
we'd be dead already.

1352
01:49:32,072 --> 01:49:34,032
Well, here they come.

1353
01:49:34,700 --> 01:49:37,202
- What's your plan?
- Just put your mask on.

1354
01:49:38,453 --> 01:49:40,789
Remember, we're on the same team.

1355
01:49:43,500 --> 01:49:45,294
Just wave and smile.

1356
01:49:45,919 --> 01:49:47,546
<i>Just wave and smile.</i>

1357
01:49:54,678 --> 01:49:56,471
What's that signal? What's he saying?

1358
01:49:56,555 --> 01:49:59,433
No idea. I have no idea what he's saying.

1359
01:50:00,309 --> 01:50:03,687
- What about that one? Any idea?
- No, never seen that one either.

1360
01:50:07,024 --> 01:50:10,819
Oh, shit. His wing man is moving
into weapons envelope.

1361
01:50:11,653 --> 01:50:13,197
All right, listen up.

1362
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:15,991
When I tell you,
you grab those rings above your head.

1363
01:50:16,074 --> 01:50:17,659
That's the ejection handle.

1364
01:50:18,744 --> 01:50:20,913
<i>Mav, can we outrun these guys?</i>

1365
01:50:21,580 --> 01:50:23,290
Not their missiles and guns.

1366
01:50:28,295 --> 01:50:29,671
Then it's a dogfight.

1367
01:50:30,380 --> 01:50:33,217
An F-14 against fifth-gen fighters?

1368
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:36,970
It's not the plane, it's the pilot.

1369
01:50:38,555 --> 01:50:40,516
You'd go after 'em if I wasn't here.

1370
01:50:41,183 --> 01:50:42,851
But you are here.

1371
01:50:43,644 --> 01:50:44,978
Come on, Mav.

1372
01:50:46,104 --> 01:50:47,272
Don't think.

1373
01:50:48,565 --> 01:50:49,608
Just do.

1374
01:51:05,249 --> 01:51:07,209
Tell me when you see smoke in the air.

1375
01:51:11,588 --> 01:51:13,674
- Smoke in the air! Smoke in the air!
- Hang on.

1376
01:51:16,510 --> 01:51:19,012
Yeah, Mav! Splash one! Splash one!

1377
01:51:24,351 --> 01:51:25,561
Here comes another one.

1378
01:51:28,814 --> 01:51:30,858
Rooster, flares! Now, now, now!

1379
01:51:34,278 --> 01:51:35,529
Splitting the throttles.

1380
01:51:37,698 --> 01:51:38,824
Coming around.

1381
01:51:43,161 --> 01:51:45,622
- Give me tone, give me tone.
- You got him, Mav! You got him!

1382
01:51:45,706 --> 01:51:46,706
Taking the shot.

1383
01:51:53,297 --> 01:51:54,548
What the...

1384
01:51:55,549 --> 01:51:57,676
Holy shit! What the fuck was that?

1385
01:51:59,094 --> 01:52:01,346
Hang on. We got to get low.

1386
01:52:01,430 --> 01:52:03,724
The terrain will confuse
his targeting system.

1387
01:52:05,851 --> 01:52:06,851
Here he comes!

1388
01:52:19,573 --> 01:52:21,491
Talk to me, Rooster. Where is he?

1389
01:52:21,575 --> 01:52:23,243
He's still on us!

1390
01:52:30,417 --> 01:52:32,503
- We took a hit! We took a hit!
- Damn it!

1391
01:52:37,591 --> 01:52:40,010
- Come on, Mav. Do some of that pilot shit.
- Brace yourself.

1392
01:52:50,479 --> 01:52:51,522
Holy shit.

1393
01:52:58,570 --> 01:53:00,405
I got tone. Taking the shot.

1394
01:53:04,868 --> 01:53:06,119
Damn it!

1395
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,373
Out of missiles. Switching to guns.

1396
01:53:15,712 --> 01:53:16,839
Come on, Mav, come on.

1397
01:53:19,508 --> 01:53:21,134
- You got him, Mav!
- It's not over yet.

1398
01:53:25,848 --> 01:53:27,683
- One last chance.
- You can do this.

1399
01:53:28,851 --> 01:53:30,060
Come on, Maverick.

1400
01:53:40,153 --> 01:53:42,072
Yes! Splash two!

1401
01:53:53,125 --> 01:53:55,043
- Mav, I got the radio on.
- Outstanding.

1402
01:53:55,127 --> 01:53:57,087
- Get us in touch with the boat.
- Copy that.

1403
01:53:59,298 --> 01:54:00,507
Oh, my God.

1404
01:54:02,509 --> 01:54:04,178
Where the hell is this guy?

1405
01:54:05,512 --> 01:54:07,097
He's on our nose.

1406
01:54:10,517 --> 01:54:11,727
Damn it, we're out of ammo.

1407
01:54:13,854 --> 01:54:16,190
Smoke in the air! Rooster, flares!

1408
01:54:18,734 --> 01:54:20,027
That was close.

1409
01:54:22,487 --> 01:54:24,406
We're out of flares, Mav.

1410
01:54:28,619 --> 01:54:30,579
Shit, he's already on us.

1411
01:54:35,417 --> 01:54:37,127
This is not good.

1412
01:54:45,302 --> 01:54:47,262
- We took another hit!
- No, no, no!

1413
01:54:52,059 --> 01:54:54,353
We can't take much more of this.

1414
01:54:54,436 --> 01:54:56,188
We can't outrun this guy. We got to eject.

1415
01:54:56,271 --> 01:54:57,523
- What?
- We need altitude.

1416
01:54:57,606 --> 01:54:59,375
Pull the ejection handles
the second I tell you.

1417
01:54:59,399 --> 01:55:01,860
- Mav, wait!
- Rooster, there's no other way.

1418
01:55:05,113 --> 01:55:06,698
Eject, eject, eject!

1419
01:55:07,533 --> 01:55:09,576
Rooster, pull the handle! Eject!

1420
01:55:09,660 --> 01:55:11,245
It's not working.

1421
01:55:21,922 --> 01:55:23,257
Mav!

1422
01:55:25,592 --> 01:55:26,927
I'm sorry.

1423
01:55:28,428 --> 01:55:29,930
I'm sorry, Goose.

1424
01:55:42,651 --> 01:55:46,655
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is your savior speaking.

1425
01:55:46,738 --> 01:55:48,282
<i>Please fasten your seat belts,</i>

1426
01:55:48,365 --> 01:55:51,410
<i>return your tray tables
to their locked and upright positions</i>

1427
01:55:52,369 --> 01:55:54,621
<i>and prepare for landing.</i>

1428
01:55:56,957 --> 01:55:59,209
Hey, Hangman, you look good.

1429
01:55:59,293 --> 01:56:02,629
I am good, Rooster. I'm very good.

1430
01:56:04,506 --> 01:56:06,216
<i>I'll see you back on deck.</i>

1431
01:56:28,113 --> 01:56:29,573
<i>Maverick is downwind.</i>

1432
01:56:29,656 --> 01:56:33,118
No front landing gear. No tail hook.
Pull the cable and raise the barricade.

1433
01:56:33,202 --> 01:56:35,287
Foul deck! Raise the barricade!

1434
01:56:36,371 --> 01:56:37,748
Go!

1435
01:57:00,270 --> 01:57:02,397
Please don't tell me we lost an engine.

1436
01:57:02,481 --> 01:57:05,108
- All right, I won't tell you that.
- Okay.

1437
01:57:28,882 --> 01:57:29,882
You good?

1438
01:57:30,551 --> 01:57:32,219
Yeah. I'm good.

1439
01:58:17,890 --> 01:58:20,392
- Chalked yourself another kill.
- That makes two.

1440
01:58:21,143 --> 01:58:23,937
Mav has five. Makes him an ace.

1441
01:58:42,164 --> 01:58:44,333
Captain Mitchell! Captain Mitchell!

1442
01:58:51,173 --> 01:58:52,424
Sir.

1443
01:59:00,015 --> 01:59:01,642
Thank you for saving my life.

1444
01:59:03,060 --> 01:59:04,937
It's what my dad would've done.

1445
01:59:44,184 --> 01:59:45,185
Hey, Mav.

1446
01:59:46,270 --> 01:59:47,354
Jimmy.

1447
01:59:48,564 --> 01:59:49,565
Is…

1448
01:59:50,482 --> 01:59:51,984
Is Penny around?

1449
01:59:52,067 --> 01:59:55,320
She took Amelia on a sailing trip.

1450
01:59:57,906 --> 02:00:00,158
Did she say when she'd be back?

1451
02:00:00,242 --> 02:00:01,743
You know, she didn't.

1452
02:00:04,079 --> 02:00:05,747
Can I get you anything?

1453
02:00:19,178 --> 02:00:20,178
Get in there.
