00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.000
Q! Come join us.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.970
I've prepared a lot of food today.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.730
How was today? Are you guys tired?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.660
Just a little bit.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.510
Why is there so much food? Is it someone's birthday today?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.020
There's no special occasion. You guys went out the whole day.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.550
I thought you guys would probably be hungry.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.640
So did you guys finish filming everything today?

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.970
Oh, I just have to edit the video and the audio...

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.950
I also need to put subtitles, which will take quite a while.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.020
Other than English subtitles, I was also thinking of putting Japanese subtitles.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.710
Q, you should learn how to do these things too.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.580
If you get chosen next year, you'll know how to do everything already.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.570
I am helping him.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.380
I'm also going to help him with the video editing at his place tomorrow.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.860
You don't have to!

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.910
It's okay. Everyone already helped me so much.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.860
I can do the rest by myself.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.800
That's not what I mean.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.060
I meant to say that you can come work on the video here until it's done.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.130
And I can take care of your meals.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.300
How does that sound?

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.970
Then... if it's not too much to ask...

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.740
May I work here for a while?

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.860
Come here, come, come here.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.330
Do you have a fever or something?

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.460
Huh?

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.140
You told me to go with them today because you didn't want them to be alone together.

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.740
And now you're arranging it so that they can be together?

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.620
Aren't you worried they're going to start developing feelings?

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.330
If that's going to happen, I'd rather it happen here.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.580
At least they'll be within my sight.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.620
I also don't want to get into an argument with my son.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.780
Like how you did with Dad.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.420
I guess that's true.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.840
It'd be great if he could think like you.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.100
But I also understand him.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.840
It's hard for someone of his generation to suddenly change their point of view.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.780
It's a good thing that you're not angry at him.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.860
I still hope that one day both of you will be able to understand each other better.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.260
I'm very glad that you're willing to understand and adjust yourself so you can maintain a good relationship with your son.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.680
I want my son to know that I will always be by his side.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.640
No matter who he is.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.020
That's great! Because if you love him, you have to give importance to his happiness.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.370
But if you love yourself more than you love your son...

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.460
You just have to... love your son more!

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.530
Seriously, what you've said up until now...

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.540
Is what you want to say to Dad, right?

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.740
(Day 18)

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.330
What time is it?!

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.140
It's 9 in the morning.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.750
It's already past the time to pay respect to the national flag.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:25.740
When did you get here?

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.150
How did you get in?

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.420
I just arrived.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.730
Uncle showed me the way here.

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.200
But I think...

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.060
You should quickly take a shower and change your clothes.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.580
If you dress thinly like this...

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.580
you might get sick.

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:48.620
I'll wait for you downstairs!

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:03.600
Since you've woken up, find something to eat too, okay?

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.960
Your Uncle and I will go outside for a bit.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.980
You guys prepared so many things...

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:09.700
Where are you going?

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:11.700
To your Grandpa's house.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.900
I think it's time I face the problems I had with your Grandpa and try to fix it.

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:19.260
Do you want to come with us?

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.300
No thanks.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.730
Then look after the house while we're gone.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.770
I can trust both of you, right?

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.420
Of course. You guys don't have to worry about anything.

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.640
They're acting weird today.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.520
It's not like they've never left the house to me before.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.710
- Thank you.
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I do.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:03.940
You look just like a princess.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.940
Why do I have to wear this?

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.220
It's not like I'm going with you.

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.620
What if you get to go?

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.300
Will you wear it?

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.620
Yes!

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.020
You guys look really good together. It's like you're shooting for a pre-wedding.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.620
Can I take some photos?

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.350
Of course!

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.420
Here, turn this way.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.550
Okay.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.680
I'll use it to promote my shop.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.350
X.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:58.580
I think it's a little weird here.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.330
Look.

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:06.700
Q.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.860
What?

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.780
No way!

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:39.170
Are you satisfied yet?

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.220
I'm very happy for you.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.860
I think Dad has become more lenient towards you.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.080
Let's take it slowly.

00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:29.660
Okay.

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:34.480
What's that sound?

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.860
Aim it properly!

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.860
You have to go at it hard, like this, at the head.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.530
X!

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.860
What are you guys doing?!

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:51.460
What are you guys playing?

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.600
We're shooting zombies.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.570
He's as bad as you.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:58.340
He's as fierce as a tiger the first few levels...

00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:00.880
But after that, he's as bad as a...

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:02.750
Dog.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.820
(Day 19)

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:17.560
What's wrong with the both of you?

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:19.820
My face is heavily injured like this...

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.180
Aren't you going to ask me anything?

00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:25.550
- What happened to you?
- What happened to you?

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.820
Whatever.

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.620
Let's talk about you guys. What's wrong?

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.240
- I have something to confess!
- I have something to confess!

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.980
- But if I say it out loud...
- But if I say it out loud...

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:48.510
- I-
- I-

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.980
Can you guys stop talking at the same time?

00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.510
Say it one at a time.

00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:57.980
- You go first.
- You go first.

00:08:59.750 --> 00:09:01.130
Stop arguing.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:02.530
Toy.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.110
You go first. What's wrong?

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.700
I...

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.770
I think I like Mook.

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:16.970
And she asked me to go to the Awards Ceremony with her.

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.100
Please don't be angry at me, Q. I'm sorry.

00:09:22.100 --> 00:09:25.150
How can you do this to your friend?

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:26.710
Wait.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:28.660
Aren't you angry?

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:31.060
This means that you're losing your bet with X!

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:41.110
Nah, I'm not.

00:09:44.510 --> 00:09:45.840
Actually, I'm happy.

00:09:46.510 --> 00:09:47.620
You'll finally get a girlfriend.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.170
But what I want to tell you...

00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:58.080
might make you guys...

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.350
even more shocked.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:03.950
- What is it?
- What is it?

00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:14.600
I...

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.460
I...

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:27.480
I'm...

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.770
- What?
- What?

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.280
I like X.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:35.480
- What?
- What?

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:38.620
I like X.

00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:40.300
- What?!
- What?!

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.730
I like X!

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:49.220
- Shit!
- Shit!

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.600
I don't want to keep it from you guys.

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.440
Because you guys are my best friends.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.260
But if you guys feel disgusted that I'm like this...

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:19.330
I understand.

00:11:26.530 --> 00:11:28.480
Aren't you looking down on us too much?

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.420
Why would I feel disgusted just because my friend fell in love?

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.740
Hm?

00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.530
I'm actually really happy that you told us.

00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:41.660
No matter who you love...

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.640
You're still my friend.

00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:44.530
Yeah!

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.820
Don't worry, man!

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:51.740
Thank you so much, both of you.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:53.940
For understanding me.

00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:56.510
Isn't that what friends are for?

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.860
Yeah. Also...

00:11:58.330 --> 00:12:00.300
Aren't you guys curious about what happened to me?

00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:01.860
So how's the progress between you and X?

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:04.060
It's going pretty nicely.

00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:05.760
- Listen to me first!
- What about you and Mook?

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.150
It's going great.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.820
21 days theory?

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:12.350
Are you kidding?

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:14.860
Nope. You can google it.

00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:18.040
It's a psychological theory.

00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:22.660
When someone does something routinely for 21 days...

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:24.620
It'll eventually become a habit.

00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:27.460
Not stopping yet?

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:29.420
- Give me that.
- Oh, wait!

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:33.300
So you tested the theory out with him?

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:36.820
So did it go well?

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:38.660
Yeah.

00:12:40.660 --> 00:12:41.550
Anyway...

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.550
I also have to thank you.

00:12:44.550 --> 00:12:47.600
For helping my plan of conquering Q go smoothly.

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.900
- Still not going to stop filming?
- What are you gonna do-

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.420
- Wait, wait-
- Stop filming!

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.900
So all of this was just a plan?

00:12:57.150 --> 00:12:58.460
So you don't actually feel anything, right?

00:12:59.080 --> 00:12:59.900
Q.

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.400
Since when did you get here?

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.140
Long enough...

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:08.020
For me to hear about your plan of deceiving me!

00:13:11.330 --> 00:13:12.820
This is all just a joke to you, right?

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:15.150
Everything that happened...

00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.110
Was for the purpose of messing with my head...

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.080
Deceiving my mom...

00:13:20.150 --> 00:13:21.540
Deceiving my uncle...

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:23.540
Just to satisfy your own humor!

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.130
Q, it's not like that.

00:13:25.130 --> 00:13:27.130
Leave me alone. Let go!

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.260
Q!

00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.260
Come on!

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.760
That's enough!

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.680
Let's go!

00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:41.020
I don't want to be here either.

00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:45.460
Q, listen to me!

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.240
Wait, don't!

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.130
Let's wait for him to calm down.

00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.140
Then we'll go and explain everything.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:51.770
But-

00:13:52.130 --> 00:13:53.600
I'll be gone the day after tomorrow.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.140
And tomorrow I have to-

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:00.200
I can't wait.

00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.020
Q!

00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:15.240
Today is the last day that I'll tutor you.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.970
How come?

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.110
Did my mom not tell you to continue tutoring me?

00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:23.060
Don't worry about that, I'll talk to her.

00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.060
My mom only has me left, so she'll follow my request.

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:30.840
It's not that...

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.200
I'm very busy with classes at uni.

00:14:33.950 --> 00:14:35.540
I also have to take care of Mook.

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.820
You don't have to set a fixed schedule for me like before.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.480
We can meet whenever you're free.

00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:45.750
I promise I'll be a good student and study hard.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.170
Frank, listen to me.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.500
Even if I don't tutor you anymore, your mom will find someone else for you.

00:14:56.060 --> 00:14:57.020
No.

00:14:58.260 --> 00:15:00.170
I don't want to lose you.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:02.240
I love you.

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.240
This is the reason! I don't want you to love me-

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:08.060
- What if I do something wrong and-
- I want you to be my older sister!

00:15:11.580 --> 00:15:14.480
Brothers... and sisters?

00:15:25.940 --> 00:15:27.220
Your older sister...

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:31.220
died because of the Coronary Artery Disease?

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:34.460
Yes.

00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.710
That's why I wanted to become a doctor.

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.820
If my sister was still alive, she'd be the same age as you.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:47.520
And...

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.240
Were you close with your sister?

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:55.940
I... When I was a kid...

00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:58.760
I'd often get bullied.

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.960
My sister would always protect me.

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:08.510
I was a kid that wasn't good at anything.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.940
I felt that...

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.940
Every time I'd make a mistake...

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:19.620
My sister would always protect me.

00:16:23.220 --> 00:16:24.820
One time...

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.900
A dog tried to bite me.

00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:34.900
My sister protected me, and she ended up getting injections because of that.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:44.700
Apart from becoming a doctor, I also want to be strong enough so I can protect other people.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.330
Is that why...

00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.740
You jumped in and fought with that guy?

00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:57.310
Thank you so much.

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:01.370
Come on.

00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:03.750
Let's continue.

00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:06.580
It's not easy to become a doctor.

00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:09.680
I'm not going to let you off easily anymore.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.370
Does that mean...

00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:17.300
You're going to continue being my teacher?

00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:21.300
You don't have to call me teacher!

00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:25.300
Let's see which day I'm free...

00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.840
Do I even have a free day?

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:32.020
- Okay.
- Let's continue.

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:33.300
You can't complain, okay?

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:36.200
Good.

00:17:45.330 --> 00:17:46.740
You're back?

00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:49.150
X didn't come with you?

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.860
No! If he comes, tell him to leave!

00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:54.660
Should I go upstairs and have a look?

00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:55.770
Nah.

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:57.440
It's their problem.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:59.730
Let them handle it themselves first.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:16.060
Hello, Mom. Hello, Uncle.

00:18:16.910 --> 00:18:18.380
What happened to your face?

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.970
There's a small misunderstanding.

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.750
- Can I see Q?
- I'll go call him for you-

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.620
Get out! We have nothing to talk about!

00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.860
Do not come here anymore!

00:18:32.340 --> 00:18:34.770
This place does not welcome you!

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.700
I think you should go back first. Nothing will come out of talking right now.

00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.310
But-

00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:43.420
Just trust me.

00:18:43.930 --> 00:18:46.040
We'll help you talk to him.

00:18:48.150 --> 00:18:49.260
Q, get inside.

00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600
Mom-

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.080
I also have to thank you.

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:29.200
For helping my plan of conquering Q go smoothly.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.300
- Still not going to stop filming?
- What are you gonna do-

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:35.750
- Wait, wait-
- Stop filming!

00:19:35.750 --> 00:19:37.350
So all of this was just a plan?

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:39.260
So you don't actually feel anything, right?

00:19:40.530 --> 00:19:43.600
This is all just a joke to you, right?

00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:45.150
Deceiving my mom...

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:47.110
Deceiving my uncle...

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:30.400
Why do I have to believe you?

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:35.550
Because I don't care if nobody believes me.

00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:39.170
But the one person that I hope would believe me...

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.110
Is you.
