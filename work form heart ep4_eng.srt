1
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:29,691
Knight!

2
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:31,469
This time I have to punish you.

3
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:32,925
I have to fire you.

4
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:33,723
Huh?

5
00:01:34,152 --> 00:01:35,521
What?

6
00:01:35,522 --> 00:01:37,151
You can't do that, boss.

7
00:01:37,365 --> 00:01:40,663
He's the only one and the
best marketing that we have.

8
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:42,944
And he's never done anything wrong.

9
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:44,965
You can't do that.

10
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:51,409
Why do people always want to find the bad guy
instead of finding a solution to fix the problem?

11
00:01:53,047 --> 00:01:57,058
I think we should buy a file restoration program
and try to restore the files, do you all agree?

12
00:01:57,281 --> 00:02:01,691
We can't download it. This company blocks the
access to download any program by ourselves.

13
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:06,379
Auntie, when are you going
to stop doing things like that?

14
00:02:07,553 --> 00:02:08,553
So...

15
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:11,640
What are we going to do with this now?

16
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,967
The IT staff is taking a day off today.

17
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:18,685
Fries.

18
00:02:19,109 --> 00:02:21,109
You call Guy.

19
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,390
Huh? Guy?

20
00:02:34,774 --> 00:02:35,921
Does it work?

21
00:02:37,346 --> 00:02:38,642
Chill out!

22
00:02:42,757 --> 00:02:43,757
I think...

23
00:02:44,292 --> 00:02:45,958
Can you tell them to step away?

24
00:02:46,424 --> 00:02:47,720
I can't breathe!

25
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:51,515
Drink it.

26
00:02:52,294 --> 00:02:53,590
My family own a coffee shop.

27
00:02:53,754 --> 00:02:55,154
Drink it, so you won't be stressed.

28
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:16,712
Thee.

29
00:03:17,734 --> 00:03:19,734
Don't you think it's a bit odd?

30
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:21,200
How can the files just vanish?

31
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,058
Yes.

32
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:25,821
I think it's impossible if
you someone didn't delete it.

33
00:03:27,365 --> 00:03:28,883
The files are very important too.

34
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:31,083
We would be in trouble if someone had it.

35
00:03:32,306 --> 00:03:35,085
We should have used the Cloud
Storage that I suggested before.

36
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:36,747
The files won't be vanished?

37
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:37,513
It will.

38
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:38,626
What?

39
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:40,400
You're getting on my nerve.

40
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,341
But at least we will know
what IP user delete it.

41
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:48,815
Moreover, our work will be much eaiser.

42
00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,196
And if we buy it with warranty,
and there's some problem,

43
00:03:53,946 --> 00:03:55,186
we won't be responsible for it.

44
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,633
No risks.

45
00:03:56,927 --> 00:03:57,629
And...

46
00:03:57,908 --> 00:04:01,947
Is it going to be slow when we download
it? It takes so long. It's boring to wait.

47
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:04,984
For you, it might be difficult.

48
00:04:05,339 --> 00:04:06,652
The internet connection
has to be very good.

49
00:04:06,676 --> 00:04:07,996
Needs a good internet connection?

50
00:04:09,105 --> 00:04:10,697
My home internet is so good.

51
00:04:11,057 --> 00:04:13,057
I mean my imaginary internet. Amazing.

52
00:04:27,533 --> 00:04:28,643
It works?

53
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:31,157
Yes. It's done.

54
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:32,507
You're amazing!

55
00:04:32,614 --> 00:04:33,614
You've got it?

56
00:04:35,265 --> 00:04:36,078
Yes.

57
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,159
We should tell boss.

58
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:40,850
Boss!

59
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:43,809
What's wrong with her?

60
00:04:44,774 --> 00:04:46,774
She wants to take credit.

61
00:05:04,374 --> 00:05:06,374
Why am I so unlucky?

62
00:05:06,692 --> 00:05:10,175
Come on baby. It's ok. I
know you will get through it.

63
00:05:10,888 --> 00:05:17,264
Boss!

64
00:05:17,304 --> 00:05:20,000
We've got the files back. Yes! Yes!

65
00:05:21,001 --> 00:05:22,001
Really?

66
00:05:22,035 --> 00:05:22,560
Yes.

67
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:24,300
But no matter what, I have to fire Knight.

68
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:28,397
Boss, we can get the files back already.

69
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,724
It's a different thing. The
bad guy should be punished.

70
00:05:32,019 --> 00:05:33,129
This time is a big deal.

71
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:35,521
Are you sure?

72
00:05:36,915 --> 00:05:38,915
Chulee, tell Knight to come see me.

73
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:40,725
Ok.

74
00:05:46,274 --> 00:05:47,274
Babe.

75
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:49,589
I don't want to do this.

76
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:53,426
I feel bad for him.

77
00:05:55,009 --> 00:05:56,200
You're firing me?

78
00:05:56,492 --> 00:05:58,492
Do you really think that I did it?

79
00:05:59,032 --> 00:06:00,364
The evidence is showing that way.

80
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:02,847
But, does it show that I deleted it?

81
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:07,901
I did the photoshoot for you
even though I did want to do it.

82
00:06:08,621 --> 00:06:10,621
So, why should I delete it?

83
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:12,865
Because you didn't want to do it.

84
00:06:14,303 --> 00:06:16,303
How could you think that way?

85
00:06:17,239 --> 00:06:18,312
You're...

86
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:20,800
not the same one I've known.

87
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:24,845
I'm the same me. What's
different is I have to go by rules.

88
00:06:25,351 --> 00:06:26,795
What rules?

89
00:06:27,343 --> 00:06:29,343
I'm not doing anything
and I'm not quitting.

90
00:06:30,499 --> 00:06:31,499
But you have to quit.

91
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:32,707
Hold on!

92
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:35,614
There's only one truth.

93
00:06:36,827 --> 00:06:39,457
The bad guy is in the office.

94
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:40,458
Dee.

95
00:06:40,653 --> 00:06:41,874
What's wrong with you?

96
00:06:42,953 --> 00:06:44,953
I've just borrowed your glasses.

97
00:06:47,736 --> 00:06:50,199
Hold on. Don't fire Knight.

98
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,200
Why?

99
00:06:51,874 --> 00:06:53,874
Because he didn't do it.

100
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:56,636
I've just check the CCTV.

101
00:06:57,307 --> 00:07:00,440
I saw that the mouse and the chair moving.

102
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:08,546
That means something happened after that.

103
00:07:08,956 --> 00:07:13,626
Boss, I also think
that Knight didn't do it.

104
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:17,103
And also we get the files back.

105
00:07:21,153 --> 00:07:22,374
You both, please leave now.

106
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:27,998
You too, Chulee!

107
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:30,947
You said both, how would I know which one?

108
00:07:31,154 --> 00:07:34,897
You think I don't exist. You said both

109
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:41,358
Babe, what about Sir?

110
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:45,713
I think you should call
Madam and ask her to help.

111
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,200
I have to bother her again?

112
00:07:48,361 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you have a better idea?

113
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:52,133
Fine.

114
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:01,825
Hello, Madam. Did you know about Dee?

115
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,714
I have a favor to ask from you.

116
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:08,532
As I explained to you. If I fire him
now, there will be no one to train Dee.

117
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:11,831
And Knight is very good at
what he does. So, please help me.

118
00:08:12,129 --> 00:08:13,610
Thank you.

119
00:08:15,804 --> 00:08:16,543
All done.

120
00:08:16,543 --> 00:08:17,543
Is everything ok?

121
00:08:17,896 --> 00:08:18,896
Ok.

122
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:24,440
Darling. About that guy,
don't make a big deal about it.

123
00:08:25,515 --> 00:08:26,960
He didn't do anything wrong.

124
00:08:27,892 --> 00:08:29,447
If you fire him,

125
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:32,159
then who's going to train our grandson.

126
00:08:33,257 --> 00:08:35,257
You always spoil him.

127
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:38,336
There are so many
people that can train him.

128
00:08:38,612 --> 00:08:40,612
If he wants, I can train him.

129
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,799
But he doesn't let me.

130
00:08:45,684 --> 00:08:47,091
And one more thing,

131
00:08:47,662 --> 00:08:49,662
if he is...

132
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:52,216
You'll be the one who regrets.

133
00:08:53,351 --> 00:08:55,351
And also, tell you beloved brother

134
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,744
don't let this happen again.

135
00:09:03,438 --> 00:09:05,438
Thank you so much for helping me today.

136
00:09:06,307 --> 00:09:07,379
So...

137
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,601
How have you been?

138
00:09:10,627 --> 00:09:11,627
Well...

139
00:09:13,241 --> 00:09:14,388
I'm the same old me.

140
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:19,039
I'm still waiting.

141
00:09:21,069 --> 00:09:22,105
Waiting for what?

142
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:26,698
I heard that..

143
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,067
You broke up with Ohm?

144
00:09:34,161 --> 00:09:35,161
Yes.

145
00:09:35,912 --> 00:09:36,912
Well...

146
00:09:37,287 --> 00:09:38,545
a while go.

147
00:09:41,226 --> 00:09:42,299
So...

148
00:09:44,385 --> 00:09:46,385
Are you seeing anyone?

149
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:49,018
No, I'm not.

150
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:51,660
But who knows.

151
00:09:55,579 --> 00:09:57,579
Do you believe in...

152
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,000
Parallel Universe?

153
00:10:00,492 --> 00:10:01,492
Maybe...

154
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,165
in another universe,

155
00:10:06,186 --> 00:10:07,630
you and I...

156
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:10,000
probably...

157
00:10:11,212 --> 00:10:12,878
are more than friends.

158
00:10:17,257 --> 00:10:18,849
Today you get the credit,

159
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:21,699
but someday

160
00:10:25,515 --> 00:10:26,922
I hope that...

161
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:30,091
I will get your heart.

162
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,427
What are you talking about? Go home.

163
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:38,052
Thank you so much.

164
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:57,983
Thank you.

165
00:11:03,154 --> 00:11:04,154
So now...

166
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:07,173
do you accept me to work with you?

167
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,535
What are you doing there?

168
00:11:15,964 --> 00:11:16,964
Come with me.

169
00:11:17,652 --> 00:11:19,059
Will you teach me everything?

170
00:11:19,193 --> 00:11:20,340
Where should I start?

171
00:11:28,991 --> 00:11:30,991
Why is it so hot today?

172
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:38,848
Baby Heya. I'm so hot. It feels
very uncomfortable in here.

173
00:11:39,234 --> 00:11:44,682
I want to take everything off. It's
so hot. You see I'm all sweating?

174
00:11:46,589 --> 00:11:49,553
If you're hot, why don't
you live in a fridge?

175
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:52,544
Your AC at home is broken?

176
00:11:53,455 --> 00:11:56,604
Why do you have to
sleep in tent at the office?

177
00:11:58,035 --> 00:11:59,664
Because I'm bored.

178
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,760
I can't take a vacation leave.

179
00:12:02,846 --> 00:12:05,476
You know? That old
auntie has a good memory.

180
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:10,287
She knows everything, when it's my day off,
what I will do, when I will take a leave.

181
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:13,882
I'm so annoyed. I don't know what she eats
to help her remember everything very well.

182
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:28,085
Why are you crying?

183
00:12:31,411 --> 00:12:33,077
Do you know...

184
00:12:34,085 --> 00:12:36,085
remember things very well..

185
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:38,481
Is better than remember nothing.

186
00:12:39,442 --> 00:12:42,146
I want my mom to be able to remember me.

187
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,073
Forever.

188
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:46,875
So...

189
00:12:48,763 --> 00:12:50,160
what's wrong with your mom?

190
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:56,839
My mom's had Alzheimer for 2-3 years now.

191
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,067
But this morning...

192
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,420
she seemed not to remember me.

193
00:13:08,333 --> 00:13:09,814
Not remember you?

194
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:34,525
It's ok.

195
00:13:42,366 --> 00:13:43,587
I'm scared.

196
00:13:43,953 --> 00:13:45,953
What am I supposed to do?

197
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:47,271
Don't be scared.

198
00:14:04,789 --> 00:14:05,909
You don't have to be scared.

199
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:08,560
I have friends who are good doctors.

200
00:14:09,496 --> 00:14:10,829
I will help you.

201
00:14:12,522 --> 00:14:13,855
Thank you so much.

202
00:14:14,817 --> 00:14:15,817
It's ok.

203
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:32,983
Too many documents.

204
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:43,139
How is it going?

205
00:14:44,152 --> 00:14:46,152
You really get to do a
real internship today.

206
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,100
You're happy now?

207
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:51,088
You told me that you
would teach me some work.

208
00:14:51,389 --> 00:14:53,389
Why am I here to put these documents away?

209
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:59,072
Song Thee said the other day that these
information can be saved in Cloud, didn't he?

210
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:02,630
We don't have to waste
papers and make it complicated.

211
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:05,122
What?

212
00:15:05,748 --> 00:15:07,488
Just an easy job like this...

213
00:15:07,801 --> 00:15:09,059
you complain already?

214
00:15:11,853 --> 00:15:12,933
What about the other job...

215
00:15:13,773 --> 00:15:14,883
would you be able to do it?

216
00:15:18,137 --> 00:15:20,768
There are so many jobs for you today.

217
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,476
Really?

218
00:15:23,327 --> 00:15:24,327
What are they?

219
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:25,775
Will you teach me everything?

220
00:15:26,523 --> 00:15:29,190
Besides the marketing work...

221
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:31,579
will you teach me...

222
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:33,213
other things...

223
00:15:33,679 --> 00:15:34,975
like you did in the car?

224
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:39,041
What car?

225
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:40,704
You got the wrong person.

226
00:15:42,134 --> 00:15:43,355
Stop lying.

227
00:15:43,711 --> 00:15:44,413
I can...

228
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,240
remember your eyes.

229
00:15:46,859 --> 00:15:47,859
Oh!

230
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,231
What are you two doing here?

231
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,748
I'm organizing the documents.

232
00:15:52,592 --> 00:15:56,632
That's good. I have to
find a contract with a client.

233
00:15:57,176 --> 00:16:00,640
I want Heya to help me but I don't
know where she is. Can you help me?

234
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,711
You will find it.

235
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:07,516
Because today...

236
00:16:08,378 --> 00:16:12,936
he has to organize all of
the documents in this room.

237
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:16,366
And also...

238
00:16:16,924 --> 00:16:17,924
if you find it...

239
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,105
let Thee know. I'm gonna go now.

240
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,360
Thee.

241
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:31,169
It's a perfect time.

242
00:16:31,376 --> 00:16:33,079
I've been wanting to talk to you.

243
00:16:33,148 --> 00:16:35,148
What's the matter with Knight?

244
00:16:35,451 --> 00:16:38,526
He's been kind of shocked
since the first time he saw my face.

245
00:16:39,687 --> 00:16:43,541
But he seemed ok when
he talked to me in a car.

246
00:16:45,564 --> 00:16:47,304
Wait. You've met him before?

247
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
Yes. When I called...

248
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,691
Don't tell anyone.

249
00:17:00,508 --> 00:17:03,435
That time I had a fight with
my grandfather at the company,

250
00:17:03,951 --> 00:17:05,951
so I called a ride to
take me out from there.

251
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:10,814
Knight was dropping a
passenger around there,

252
00:17:11,747 --> 00:17:15,008
so he accepted my ride request
and we got to talk a bit in the car.

253
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,810
Because of his words,

254
00:17:17,943 --> 00:17:23,169
he made me brave to come
out and find my own happiness.

255
00:17:25,988 --> 00:17:26,988
But...

256
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,339
when I took of a mask,

257
00:17:29,543 --> 00:17:30,543
he was shocked.

258
00:17:32,276 --> 00:17:35,759
And when he helped me from Ohm,

259
00:17:36,543 --> 00:17:38,543
he saw my face and he was shocked again.

260
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,183
I'm not even talking about when...

261
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,490
he saw me in boss' office.

262
00:17:47,128 --> 00:17:48,560
I'm really not sure.

263
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:54,685
But from my point of view,
he has a persona of wolves,

264
00:17:54,686 --> 00:17:57,399
he likes to be alone. He
doesn't like social interaction.

265
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,200
He just sits at his desk
alone all day, works quietly,

266
00:18:00,224 --> 00:18:03,893
puts headphones on and not talk to
anyone. You can say that he's anti-social.

267
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:22,640
So, I think there's something that
Knight is afraid or doesn't like about you.

268
00:18:24,935 --> 00:18:27,973
You've said a very long
speech. I only catch the last one.

269
00:18:28,516 --> 00:18:30,000
Like I said.

270
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:33,248
But if you want me to
analyze it again, I think...

271
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:34,470
That's enough.

272
00:18:35,122 --> 00:18:36,562
No need to analyze anything anymore.

273
00:18:37,896 --> 00:18:38,896
By the way,

274
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:41,445
what does he like?

275
00:18:42,927 --> 00:18:45,520
What he likes? You mean what is his type?

276
00:18:46,467 --> 00:18:48,467
No. I mean...

277
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:51,088
what he likes to eat, what he likes to do.

278
00:18:51,987 --> 00:18:53,987
Why did you ask? You
want to flirt with him?

279
00:18:56,773 --> 00:18:58,069
Are you crazy?

280
00:18:58,259 --> 00:18:59,629
I just...

281
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:02,974
want to find something to flatter him.

282
00:19:03,545 --> 00:19:05,545
So, maybe it will make him not hate me.

283
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:10,560
But you seem care so much about
him, since that day the files were gone.

284
00:19:11,148 --> 00:19:13,148
Normally, you don't do things like that.

285
00:19:14,928 --> 00:19:18,189
Thee. I have to help him,

286
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:20,467
otherwise who's gonna train me.

287
00:19:21,949 --> 00:19:22,949
By the way,

288
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,563
What about you?

289
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:27,604
You've had a crush on Veve since college.

290
00:19:28,783 --> 00:19:30,412
Now you get to work together.

291
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,486
- Is there any progress?
- Be quiet.

292
00:19:34,398 --> 00:19:36,198
People here have a
very good listening skill.

293
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:38,102
SEspecially, Auntie Chulee. So, be quiet.

294
00:19:43,272 --> 00:19:44,975
Is someone talking about me?

295
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,460
So, how is it?

296
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,262
I don't feel that way now.

297
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,275
When we were working
on Miss Suzy's project,

298
00:19:56,235 --> 00:19:58,235
I heard that you gave your all.

299
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:00,479
I had to do it for our company.

300
00:20:02,213 --> 00:20:04,880
I can tell. Just confess now.

301
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:09,640
Yes. I like her but sometimes...

302
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:12,003
I don't know how to say it.

303
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:14,284
You haven't changed.

304
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:17,462
But as I said, how can you
get her as your girlfriend?

305
00:20:18,461 --> 00:20:21,499
You take too long to get to
what you really want to say.

306
00:20:22,087 --> 00:20:26,571
When it comes to feelings, no
need to take a long time, just say it.

307
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,760
Love is evaluated by
heart, brain comes after.

308
00:20:32,592 --> 00:20:35,630
But it's ok, your chance is here.

309
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:37,392
What chance?

310
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:39,567
The chance that I will help you.

311
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,180
How?

312
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,175
Leave it to me.

313
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:49,837
Stop babbling. If you find
the contract, give it to me.

314
00:20:50,236 --> 00:20:52,458
Why are Chao Sua's bags here?

315
00:20:52,687 --> 00:20:54,427
Clean it up, please.

316
00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:56,144
I'll get back to work now.

317
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,159
Ok.

318
00:21:03,714 --> 00:21:04,714
Hey!

319
00:21:04,923 --> 00:21:08,369
Screaming like that, how are
you gonna help him, Mr. Planner?

320
00:21:09,104 --> 00:21:11,660
When did you come here?

321
00:21:12,577 --> 00:21:14,846
At first I wanted to come in here and
Chao Sua's Mini Crispy Rice Cracker.

322
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:16,350
It's a small bite but very delicious.

323
00:21:16,531 --> 00:21:17,827
I ate until I fell asleep.

324
00:21:19,172 --> 00:21:22,173
But this flavor is very
good. You have to try it.

325
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:36,543
Actually I woke up already but I don't
know what Song Thee was talking about.

326
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:38,552
It was very long, so I
decided to get more sleep.

327
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:40,706
So, how are you gonna help him?

328
00:21:42,049 --> 00:21:47,720
When it comes to feelings, no
need to think too much, just say it.

329
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:52,745
Gypsy cards reading?

330
00:21:57,355 --> 00:21:58,391
Veve.

331
00:21:58,783 --> 00:22:00,000
Hey.

332
00:22:01,098 --> 00:22:03,258
Today we're having a
religious ceremony at our office?

333
00:22:03,729 --> 00:22:05,728
Why is the holy thread very long?

334
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:07,136
Don't drop it.

335
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,057
Otherwise it won't be holy.

336
00:22:09,058 --> 00:22:10,058
No, it's not like that.

337
00:22:10,418 --> 00:22:11,418
Let's do this,

338
00:22:11,586 --> 00:22:12,622
you...

339
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:13,791
hold...

340
00:22:14,071 --> 00:22:15,071
this rope.

341
00:22:15,378 --> 00:22:16,054
Hold this rope?

342
00:22:16,054 --> 00:22:17,054
Yes.

343
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:19,048
And close your eyes.

344
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:22,863
What are you playing?

345
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:26,663
Then stand up slowly.

346
00:22:29,077 --> 00:22:30,892
And follow this rope.

347
00:22:32,796 --> 00:22:33,980
Ok.

348
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,503
I'm a bit scared.

349
00:22:41,323 --> 00:22:42,544
Enough?

350
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:43,806
Keep going.

351
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:44,807
Ok.

352
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:46,907
Open you eyes, honey.

353
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:51,946
Open this paper and read it.

354
00:23:02,523 --> 00:23:04,760
I have a crush on you
but I'm scared to tell you.

355
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:09,861
Hey!

356
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:15,199
Where did they go?

357
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:18,888
I have a crush on you
but I'm scared to tell you.

358
00:23:20,527 --> 00:23:22,193
Or...

359
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,275
maybe Song Thee has a crush on me?

360
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:28,506
He's crazy.

361
00:23:30,001 --> 00:23:31,334
Why didn't he tell me?

362
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:56,169
This bill is from Thep.

363
00:23:57,772 --> 00:24:00,921
What kind coffee did you buy for
the client? It's 150 baht per cup.

364
00:24:03,189 --> 00:24:07,790
Stop. The point is you bought 2 cups of coffee. 1 cup was
for yourself, why are you withdrawing the money for that?

365
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:15,509
Hey Auntie. I'm the one who does the work. I
went there for work. What's wrong with that?

366
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:21,047
Everything is wrong. And
there's a food bill from you too.

367
00:24:21,329 --> 00:24:23,849
When are you going to stop
taking clients outside for meetings?

368
00:24:24,035 --> 00:24:26,035
We have a meeting room in our place.

369
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:31,048
Did you really go outside to meet clients
or did you go out for a date with some girl?

370
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,400
Why are you playing
with the truth like that?

371
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:36,810
You're making it worse.

372
00:24:36,956 --> 00:24:40,000
Auntie, do you want to quit being HR?

373
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:42,090
You want to quit being an accountant?

374
00:24:42,091 --> 00:24:44,091
And start working for FBI or CIA.

375
00:24:44,645 --> 00:24:50,880
It's only a coffee. It's not going
to make the company go broke.

376
00:24:51,107 --> 00:24:53,107
I did it for our company.

377
00:24:54,053 --> 00:24:58,648
When I want to get the money back, it's so hard. But
when you want me to pay in advance, it's so easy.

378
00:24:59,189 --> 00:25:00,189
Yes.

379
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,333
I'm working in Office of Forensic Science.

380
00:25:02,749 --> 00:25:08,494
And about you using the same supplier
for every work. You should stop it.

381
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,639
If I know there's something
behind it, I will kick everyone out.

382
00:25:11,955 --> 00:25:13,955
Go for it. Kick me out.

383
00:25:14,211 --> 00:25:18,733
Now I work only 40%, you're lucky enough.

384
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:21,645
I go ask other people to work with
us, they really don't want to do it.

385
00:25:22,409 --> 00:25:30,000
Kick me out. I'm happy with that, so
I don't have to beg anyone for help.

386
00:25:30,809 --> 00:25:32,809
You act like...

387
00:25:37,247 --> 00:25:38,987
Moo Yong. Here.

388
00:25:38,988 --> 00:25:39,579
Yes?

389
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:40,586
This is for you.

390
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,434
For me?

391
00:25:44,687 --> 00:25:45,687
Why?

392
00:25:46,541 --> 00:25:51,730
So you can use for your work.
I know you're very creative.

393
00:25:52,519 --> 00:25:54,519
You will have something
to support your work.

394
00:25:54,943 --> 00:25:57,343
And the most important thing
is the files won't be vanished.

395
00:25:57,488 --> 00:25:59,648
Otherwise, we have to
restore again. It's so annoying.

396
00:25:59,783 --> 00:26:01,783
You're such a payer.

397
00:26:02,397 --> 00:26:03,397
You're very kind.

398
00:26:03,477 --> 00:26:04,477
It's normal.

399
00:26:05,076 --> 00:26:07,076
You bought an iPad for Moo Yong?

400
00:26:07,106 --> 00:26:08,402
Where's the reciept?

401
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:10,000
Did you use the company's money?

402
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:15,480
What's the matter with you?
Why do you nitpick everyone?

403
00:26:16,101 --> 00:26:18,101
Can't you think?

404
00:26:18,437 --> 00:26:20,437
Today is his special
day, it's his birthday.

405
00:26:20,438 --> 00:26:22,438
I just bought him a gift.

406
00:26:22,676 --> 00:26:24,268
You're unbelievable.

407
00:26:24,497 --> 00:26:28,128
We know very well that he won't buy something
like this for himself. He's very stingy.

408
00:26:28,903 --> 00:26:35,389
How can he buy it? You know? When his salary
comes out, he has to send money to his family

409
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,191
So he's like this.

410
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:38,920
Happy birthday Moo Yong.

411
00:26:39,502 --> 00:26:43,356
Thank you so much. But you give
me this without any works, right?

412
00:26:43,357 --> 00:26:45,357
Open it. I already put a note for you.

413
00:26:47,134 --> 00:26:48,317
It's your birthday?

414
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:49,318
Yes.

415
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,110
I have nothing for you
but I will sing for you.

416
00:27:04,651 --> 00:27:08,091
I give you until lunch time. Give me all the
bills, otherwise you won't get the money.

417
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:11,362
She's unbelievable. Just sing happy
birthday, we still get a bill from her.

418
00:27:12,261 --> 00:27:15,077
A person like her won't die beautifully.

419
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:22,260
Veve.

420
00:27:22,261 --> 00:27:23,297
Is it a good idea?

421
00:27:23,438 --> 00:27:24,734
That is Song Thee.

422
00:27:25,285 --> 00:27:26,395
Don't worry!

423
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,396
He won't know. Trust me.

424
00:27:29,122 --> 00:27:32,120
If you want to know, why
don't you just ask him?

425
00:27:32,978 --> 00:27:37,166
Are you crazy? If this was a
trick, I would be so embarrassed.

426
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:42,520
Then, why don't you ask the
interns that like to pick on you?

427
00:27:44,457 --> 00:27:47,755
I've been looking for them
everywhere. I don't know where they are.

428
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:53,439
Why do you want to know so much?

429
00:27:53,928 --> 00:27:55,928
That you asked me to help you with this.

430
00:27:58,521 --> 00:27:59,521
Hey.

431
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,295
Or...

432
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:04,281
you like him too?

433
00:28:04,636 --> 00:28:06,636
That's why you want to know how he feels.

434
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:11,458
That's crazy. I don't like him.

435
00:28:12,162 --> 00:28:14,162
I just want to know.

436
00:28:15,147 --> 00:28:19,480
And a fortune teller told me
that I would meet my soulmate.

437
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:22,482
If he's the one, then it
will be good for me, right?

438
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:24,095
So I will have a boyfriend.

439
00:28:24,096 --> 00:28:27,542
But if he's not, so we can clear the air.

440
00:28:28,706 --> 00:28:29,630
Or...

441
00:28:29,631 --> 00:28:31,148
it's better that I don't know?

442
00:28:31,688 --> 00:28:32,688
Stop babbling.

443
00:28:33,317 --> 00:28:34,650
He's coming.

444
00:28:35,893 --> 00:28:38,333
You called me here, is there
anything you want to talk to me?

445
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:41,733
You've helped me a lot of times.

446
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,112
And...

447
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:45,646
This is Note. My boyfriend.

448
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:47,927
He wants to thank you

449
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:49,800
for helping me.

450
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:51,933
Boyfriend?

451
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:53,337
Yes.

452
00:28:53,508 --> 00:28:55,508
If you want to order anything, go for it.

453
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:57,144
Don't feel bad.

454
00:28:58,290 --> 00:29:00,290
You're so cute baby.

455
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,680
If I'm cute then...

456
00:29:03,947 --> 00:29:05,243
you should give me a reward.

457
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,410
Huh?

458
00:29:12,235 --> 00:29:13,901
You're crazy.

459
00:29:13,902 --> 00:29:15,902
I don't want to kiss you here.

460
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,230
Are you crazy?

461
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:28,245
I'm shy. A lot of people here.

462
00:29:28,246 --> 00:29:30,246
Song Thee is sitting here too.

463
00:29:30,744 --> 00:29:32,744
It's inappropriate.

464
00:29:34,229 --> 00:29:35,229
Right?

465
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:39,696
There's no one here.
Don't mind me. Go for it.

466
00:29:40,375 --> 00:29:42,375
If you want to kiss each other, you can.

467
00:29:50,316 --> 00:29:51,612
Hold on.

468
00:29:52,336 --> 00:29:54,336
I will take a picture for you.

469
00:29:54,363 --> 00:29:56,363
So you can keep it as a good memory.

470
00:29:58,585 --> 00:30:00,585
You're so generous.

471
00:30:07,269 --> 00:30:08,840
Darling.

472
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:11,298
Babe.

473
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:13,775
I'll be back.

474
00:30:15,502 --> 00:30:16,502
Don't be too long.

475
00:30:33,734 --> 00:30:35,734
Are you tired of the same trick?

476
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,238
What trick?

477
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:39,089
Well...

478
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,086
You have your friend
pretending to be your boyfriend.

479
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,110
For what?

480
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:44,343
Well...

481
00:30:45,965 --> 00:30:47,149
I want to know.

482
00:30:48,838 --> 00:30:50,000
About what?

483
00:30:52,029 --> 00:30:53,399
I want to know

484
00:30:54,216 --> 00:30:57,032
if you feels anything for me.

485
00:31:01,143 --> 00:31:02,143
Yes.

486
00:31:02,846 --> 00:31:03,846
What do you think?

487
00:31:04,582 --> 00:31:05,618
Well...

488
00:31:05,771 --> 00:31:08,438
If you want to know, come with me tonight.

489
00:31:10,822 --> 00:31:12,822
Where are we going? And what will we do?

490
00:31:12,991 --> 00:31:14,509
Come with me to find out.

491
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:16,197
Just tell me now.

492
00:31:20,001 --> 00:31:22,001
So demanding.

493
00:31:23,997 --> 00:31:25,997
Shit! Is this your plan?

494
00:31:26,352 --> 00:31:27,388
Amazing!

495
00:31:27,958 --> 00:31:28,958
No!

496
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,425
It wasn't me.

497
00:31:30,844 --> 00:31:32,844
Veve is busted herself.

498
00:31:33,104 --> 00:31:35,104
But that's ok. I'll say it's a success.

499
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:39,920
What about you?

500
00:31:40,602 --> 00:31:42,200
I heard you in that room,

501
00:31:42,549 --> 00:31:44,549
that you talked to Song Thee about Knight.

502
00:31:47,404 --> 00:31:48,922
What did you hear?

503
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:53,692
Dude, I've been friends with
you since we were so little.

504
00:31:53,853 --> 00:31:55,075
How could I not see it?

505
00:31:55,076 --> 00:31:56,076
But...

506
00:31:56,348 --> 00:31:57,520
What could you see?

507
00:31:58,127 --> 00:32:03,640
You seem to care so much about Knight.

508
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:07,230
You do it just because you don't want
him to hate you, is that the real reason?

509
00:32:07,254 --> 00:32:08,254
Huh?

510
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:09,643
So?

511
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,961
What are you saying?
You know it's impossible.

512
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:18,242
But I think it's possible. I've noticed
how he looks at you when you're unaware.

513
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:39,007
You're very observant lately.

514
00:32:39,304 --> 00:32:41,104
Since you started
working with Auntie Chulee.

515
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:02,885
You're not going home yet?

516
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,973
No. I still have lots of work to do.

517
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:10,741
Is there anything I can help you with?

518
00:33:10,834 --> 00:33:13,687
I've finished all the works
that you assigned me.

519
00:33:16,605 --> 00:33:17,715
It's ok.

520
00:33:17,998 --> 00:33:19,998
You should go home. It's getting late now.

521
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:24,275
Let me help you.

522
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,653
I know you can't do it all by yourself.

523
00:33:28,045 --> 00:33:30,045
I'm a fast learner.

524
00:33:32,969 --> 00:33:34,339
You want to help?

525
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:35,219
Yes.

526
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:37,119
And...

527
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,792
Your family is ok if you get home late?

528
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:41,652
They're ok,

529
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:42,936
I guess?

530
00:33:45,852 --> 00:33:46,352
Ok.

531
00:33:46,747 --> 00:33:47,747
Then...

532
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:55,448
You know what you have to do?

533
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,967
I don't know but I will.

534
00:34:25,253 --> 00:34:26,845
Can I ask you something?

535
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:29,717
Why do you have to...

536
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:31,023
work very hard

537
00:34:31,265 --> 00:34:35,082
when you already have everything?

538
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:40,000
Well...

539
00:34:40,312 --> 00:34:41,756
long time ago

540
00:34:42,588 --> 00:34:44,588
there was a driver once told me

541
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:46,943
to go out and live my own life.

542
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,637
I didn't say that.

543
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,872
You fell for my trick.

544
00:34:55,323 --> 00:34:57,323
I know that you remember me.

545
00:34:57,736 --> 00:34:58,809
Stop pretending.

546
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:05,428
I remember that you said

547
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:08,305
"Do you dare to go out
and love your own life?"

548
00:35:09,196 --> 00:35:14,014
"Even it's a failure or success, are you
gonna be happy with what you choose?"

549
00:35:15,771 --> 00:35:16,960
Because of my words?

550
00:35:17,253 --> 00:35:18,253
Yes.

551
00:35:18,938 --> 00:35:23,579
The life turning point of many people
can happen because of a few words.

552
00:35:28,622 --> 00:35:29,622
And you?

553
00:35:30,352 --> 00:35:32,352
Are you happy with what you've chosen?

554
00:35:33,819 --> 00:35:34,819
Yes, I am.

555
00:35:36,197 --> 00:35:37,493
Because my happiness...

556
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,540
is right in front of me.

557
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:48,072
These paper works in front of me here
make me happy and I can improve myself.

558
00:35:52,074 --> 00:35:53,474
That's good that you're determined.

559
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:58,697
Of course I am because I want
to prove myself to my loved one,

560
00:35:58,923 --> 00:36:00,923
the one who's right beside me.

561
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:11,909
My grandparents, I want prove and
show them how much I love them.

562
00:36:14,247 --> 00:36:15,247
Ok.

563
00:36:15,876 --> 00:36:17,394
Of course it's ok because...

564
00:36:17,395 --> 00:36:18,395
That's enough.

565
00:36:18,675 --> 00:36:19,675
Do your work now.

566
00:36:19,871 --> 00:36:21,055
Then we won't get to do...

567
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,314
If we don't work, then what will we do?

568
00:36:50,534 --> 00:36:52,534
Choose the right one. Radio Media.

569
00:36:52,918 --> 00:36:57,034
Meet the target customers' needs that are ready to buy the
products and can get to more than 50 million customers per month.

570
00:36:57,058 --> 00:37:01,720
Contact DV8 Limited
Company. Call 092-4923377

571
00:37:01,871 --> 00:37:02,871
Oh. There's DIFA too.

572
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:09,236
Put a weapon to your brand with DIFA. The
better agency and gives you more than anything.

573
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,400
What now?

574
00:37:18,199 --> 00:37:20,199
Why is it always me in this situation?

575
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:21,480
Get to work. Go!

576
00:37:22,108 --> 00:37:23,108
Quickly.

577
00:37:23,870 --> 00:37:25,462
Why are you so into this?

578
00:37:32,933 --> 00:37:36,082
I'm peacefully and beautifully dead today.

579
00:37:36,691 --> 00:37:38,691
What happened? Tell us.

580
00:37:39,704 --> 00:37:43,706
It's about our oppa and Dee.

581
00:37:43,966 --> 00:37:46,633
Your imagination again.

582
00:37:48,868 --> 00:37:50,608
Knight and Dee like each other?

583
00:37:50,963 --> 00:37:52,518
Spit it out.

584
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,688
It's nothing. She just
made it up in her head.

585
00:37:58,826 --> 00:38:00,826
No, I didn't. It's true.

586
00:38:08,716 --> 00:38:10,716
What are you doing here?

587
00:38:13,929 --> 00:38:15,929
You believe in this kind of stuff?

588
00:38:16,268 --> 00:38:17,268
Yes.

589
00:38:18,801 --> 00:38:20,801
What did you pray and ask for?

590
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:23,039
To tell you how I feel.

591
00:38:23,829 --> 00:38:25,829
Are you crazy? No one
does something like that.

592
00:38:27,278 --> 00:38:29,278
I'm just scared to say it.

593
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,565
And how are you gonna redeem your vows?

594
00:38:34,068 --> 00:38:35,068
A Thai dance.

595
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:36,273
A Thai dance?

596
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:42,372
I don't know. The other day I heard you and Moo
Yong talked about it, so I wanted to try it.

597
00:38:42,702 --> 00:38:44,702
I didn't think it would work.

598
00:38:50,008 --> 00:38:51,008
So...

599
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:52,471
how...

600
00:38:52,941 --> 00:38:57,648
did you know that Note and I are friends?

601
00:39:00,001 --> 00:39:02,928
Since you guys were in college,
you guys were bestfriends back then.

602
00:39:04,113 --> 00:39:05,113
Wait!

603
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:07,689
How did you know we've
been friends since college?

604
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:10,224
I studied in the same college as you.

605
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,321
You saw me there.

606
00:39:12,529 --> 00:39:14,529
Why didn't I know about this?

607
00:39:14,884 --> 00:39:16,884
I don't remember you.

608
00:39:17,925 --> 00:39:19,925
I was out of your
sight. It's just like that.

609
00:39:20,212 --> 00:39:23,065
So, when I'm in your sight
now, I have to play in a character.

610
00:39:43,109 --> 00:39:46,221
Although we are best friends,

611
00:39:47,816 --> 00:39:49,816
doesn't mean we can't be more than that.

612
00:39:51,002 --> 00:39:52,002
That's true.

613
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,015
But Note's girlfriend is my friend.

614
00:39:57,435 --> 00:39:58,731
What a small world.

615
00:39:59,743 --> 00:40:01,335
And...

616
00:40:02,172 --> 00:40:04,506
How did you like me? And
when did you start to like me?

617
00:40:06,131 --> 00:40:08,131
You ask so many questions.

618
00:40:10,457 --> 00:40:11,938
It's a past, just leave it there.

619
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,728
Why?

620
00:40:16,697 --> 00:40:18,697
Now I still like you.

621
00:40:19,497 --> 00:40:20,570
I like you so much.

622
00:40:27,602 --> 00:40:28,712
Go for it.

623
00:40:29,512 --> 00:40:32,216
The stage is yours.

624
00:40:33,574 --> 00:40:34,870
Since we're here...

625
00:40:36,791 --> 00:40:40,000
I will capture this moment.

626
00:40:43,289 --> 00:40:44,917
Keep dancing.

627
00:40:44,918 --> 00:40:45,769
Am I doing it ok?

628
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:46,769
Yes.

629
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,391
Come dance with me.

630
00:40:54,465 --> 00:40:55,240
Nope.

631
00:40:55,241 --> 00:40:56,241
Just a little.

632
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:58,805
Come here. I'll tech you.

633
00:40:58,808 --> 00:41:00,808
Teach me what? You
can't even do it yourself.

634
00:41:00,851 --> 00:41:02,109
Come dance together.

635
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:05,160
One hand like this,
the other hand like this.

636
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:06,110
Like this?

637
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:06,833
Yes.

638
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:08,127
Go with the rhythm.

639
00:41:09,271 --> 00:41:10,000
Really?

640
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:12,000
Yes. You're doing good.

641
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,875
Yes. That's right.

642
00:41:19,652 --> 00:41:20,280
Like this?

643
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:20,780
Yes.

644
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:22,214
But I'm doing off the beat.

645
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:23,278
It's ok, right?

646
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,340
Yes. It's ok.

647
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:43,431
Ok.

648
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:54,026
If I want you to say you love me...

649
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,809
do I have to pray for it again?

650
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,266
And now, you're not scared to say it.

651
00:42:36,922 --> 00:42:40,628
Today I'm introducing you
a new Marketing Consultant.

652
00:42:41,216 --> 00:42:42,474
Hello everyone.

653
00:42:47,796 --> 00:42:49,796
Did Dee do anything
to give you bad feelings?

654
00:42:51,522 --> 00:42:52,522
No, he didn't.

655
00:42:52,711 --> 00:42:53,969
Give me your hand.

656
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:56,917
Many people here.

657
00:43:00,129 --> 00:43:01,257
I'm delighted.

658
00:43:01,258 --> 00:43:05,149
So, you two are working
together all the time,

659
00:43:06,085 --> 00:43:07,805
don't you have any feelings for each other?

660
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:10,548
Get up on it and put your hands here.

661
00:43:11,514 --> 00:43:12,514
Ok.
