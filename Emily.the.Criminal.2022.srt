1
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:01,844
Okay.

2
00:01:01,887 --> 00:01:05,543
Okay, oh. Office
experience, which is great.

3
00:01:06,588 --> 00:01:07,980
Okay.

4
00:01:08,024 --> 00:01:10,113
So Emily, I do see
that you have something

5
00:01:10,157 --> 00:01:12,202
on your permanent record.

6
00:01:12,246 --> 00:01:13,725
Is that right?

7
00:01:13,769 --> 00:01:16,641
Yeah. Yes, it is.

8
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:19,514
Oh. We haven't run
a background check.

9
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:21,081
We don't usually do that.

10
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,995
Could you fill us
in on the details?

11
00:01:23,039 --> 00:01:24,127
Sure.

12
00:01:24,171 --> 00:01:27,957
I have DUI, like,
a misdemeanor DUI.

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,046
What happened exactly?

14
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,138
I drove some friends
home from a concert

15
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:37,619
and I ran a red light.

16
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:39,142
Everybody was fine, but.

17
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:42,319
And you were intoxicated?

18
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:48,673
I was less intoxicated
than my friends, but yeah,

19
00:01:48,717 --> 00:01:50,501
that's what happened, so.

20
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:53,329
Okay.

21
00:01:55,767 --> 00:02:00,294
So this is your official
background check,

22
00:02:00,337 --> 00:02:03,166
which I have read and
according to the state,

23
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:05,821
you were convicted of
aggravated assault in 2016.

24
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:06,864
Is that correct?

25
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,260
So, you do have
all my information?

26
00:02:12,044 --> 00:02:14,699
Yeah, yeah. I'm afraid we do.

27
00:02:17,876 --> 00:02:18,877
Okay. Okay.

28
00:02:18,921 --> 00:02:20,227
Why would you.

29
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:23,055
Well, if you want us

30
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:24,492
to be generous with you,

31
00:02:24,535 --> 00:02:27,016
then you need to be generous
with us and be honest.

32
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:28,059
Okay?

33
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:30,454
Okay.

34
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:31,760
This is a very important job.

35
00:02:31,803 --> 00:02:33,762
You'd be handling
private medical files.

36
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,980
Right.

37
00:02:38,332 --> 00:02:39,159
Right. You're right.

38
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:40,203
I'm sorry.

39
00:02:40,247 --> 00:02:42,901
Yeah. Let's start over, okay?

40
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:43,945
Okay.

41
00:02:45,121 --> 00:02:47,471
Can you tell us what
happened with the assault?

42
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,872
No.

43
00:02:56,915 --> 00:02:58,134
No?

44
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,459
No. Why would you trick
somebody like that?

45
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:00,789
Oh! I did not trick you.

46
00:03:00,832 --> 00:03:02,094
Yeah, you did.

47
00:03:03,531 --> 00:03:05,228
What I did is very common.

48
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:06,577
That's a very common technique.

49
00:03:06,621 --> 00:03:08,536
Oh, is that right? So,
you do that all the time?

50
00:03:08,579 --> 00:03:09,972
If people chose to be honest,

51
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:11,775
then I wouldn't have to
do that all the time.

52
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,714
Well, you know what? Fuck this.

53
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:13,778
I don't even want to work here.

54
00:03:13,802 --> 00:03:15,325
Emily, I'm sorry
you're upset but.

55
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:16,196
No, you're not.

56
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,022
Calm down, please.

57
00:03:17,066 --> 00:03:18,154
I am calm.

58
00:03:18,198 --> 00:03:19,305
And you asked me
why I want this job

59
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:20,654
because I got $70,000
of student debt.

60
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:21,636
There's your fucking
answer right there.

61
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:22,550
Yeah. You need to leave.

62
00:03:22,593 --> 00:03:23,290
Yeah, actually. You know what?

63
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,552
Give me that too.

64
00:03:24,595 --> 00:03:25,877
Okay, fine. Thank you.
Yeah, thank you too.

65
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:26,901
Excuse me.

66
00:03:34,562 --> 00:03:35,345
There you go.

67
00:03:35,389 --> 00:03:36,389
Yo.

68
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:39,931
Can I get that
dressing on the side?

69
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,389
So, this is the house
salad, dressing on the side,

70
00:05:26,413 --> 00:05:29,154
then the chicken
churrasco, black beans.

71
00:05:29,198 --> 00:05:31,069
Okay. Did we get
two rice orders?

72
00:05:31,113 --> 00:05:32,070
Two rice. Two veggies.

73
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:33,114
Okay, good.

74
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:46,563
Hey, yo! Emily, yo. Are
you working tonight?

75
00:05:46,607 --> 00:05:47,477
No, I just got off.

76
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:48,826
Do you want my shift?

77
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,369
My son has a baseball
game in Glendale.

78
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:51,501
His mother was
supposed to take him.

79
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:52,850
I called everybody,
like, everybody.

80
00:05:52,874 --> 00:05:54,460
Dude, I don't usually
work downtown at night.

81
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:56,051
I know this. Big favor.

82
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:01,709
All right, I got you.

83
00:06:01,752 --> 00:06:03,754
Thank you, gracias, for real.

84
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:07,497
Let me, yeah, yeah.
One second, okay?

85
00:06:08,846 --> 00:06:10,108
Let me hook you up.

86
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,895
Text that number.

87
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:16,245
You can make like
200 bucks in an hour.

88
00:06:16,288 --> 00:06:17,246
I swear to God.

89
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:18,552
What is this?

90
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:19,595
Dummy shopper.

91
00:06:20,902 --> 00:06:22,164
You know what that is? Yeah?

92
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,208
Dummy shopper.

93
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:25,646
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
It's super easy.

94
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:27,474
You and me at lunch
tomorrow, right?

95
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:28,344
Yeah, I'll see you then.

96
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:29,258
All right. Be good.

97
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,868
Thank you. Come on.

98
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:39,921
Hey. Hey.

99
00:06:39,964 --> 00:06:41,444
You got some mail.

100
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:42,488
Thanks.

101
00:06:51,236 --> 00:06:52,455
Hi, yeah.

102
00:06:52,499 --> 00:06:54,283
I paid $400 on the 10th

103
00:06:54,326 --> 00:06:56,241
and it was never
applied to my balance.

104
00:06:58,896 --> 00:06:59,896
$400.

105
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,902
It was applied to my interest?

106
00:07:06,687 --> 00:07:09,777
Sorry. How much interest
is being added a month?

107
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:22,022
Doing what?

108
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:36,428
Excuse me, lady.

109
00:08:36,472 --> 00:08:37,952
You can't park
here. You got to go.

110
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:38,995
All right.

111
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,397
Hey. Hi. Hi, hi, hi.

112
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,530
Yo. Sorry. Oh no, it's all good.

113
00:08:50,573 --> 00:08:51,835
I just got here.

114
00:08:51,879 --> 00:08:54,272
God, my life is so
fucking insane right now.

115
00:08:54,316 --> 00:08:56,536
I can't even-Are you okay?

116
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,276
Yeah, no. I'm going to Portugal.

117
00:08:59,495 --> 00:09:00,627
For work?

118
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:02,498
Yeah, I got to go
oversee this photo shoot

119
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:03,586
for a print campaign.

120
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,892
So we're going to Porto,

121
00:09:04,935 --> 00:09:08,417
some little village
on the Spanish border.

122
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,462
Holy shit. Yeah, yeah.

123
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:11,899
It's only for 11 days but

124
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,030
11 days? That's awesome.

125
00:09:13,074 --> 00:09:14,858
Yeah, I know.

126
00:09:14,902 --> 00:09:18,340
Yeah. So how are you?

127
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:19,863
What's up? It's been a minute.

128
00:09:19,907 --> 00:09:21,430
Are you still doing portraits?

129
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:24,128
Yeah. Like, yes and no.

130
00:09:24,172 --> 00:09:26,130
I'm not painting at
all right now. Yeah.

131
00:09:28,742 --> 00:09:30,308
Paint's expensive.

132
00:09:30,352 --> 00:09:32,441
Yes. Yeah, I need a job.

133
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:34,486
Oh. Yeah.

134
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,185
Like a real job, like
a real job. Yeah.

135
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:40,536
Yeah. Just to like
pay my loans and yeah.

136
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,929
So I might go back to Jersey

137
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:44,366
and live with my stepdad
for awhile and save money.

138
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,761
No. What?

139
00:09:47,804 --> 00:09:49,806
Is that what you want to do?

140
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,634
No, but yeah.

141
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:57,335
Okay. What if I got
you an interview?

142
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,686
'Cause I know that we're
hiring a graphic designer

143
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,688
and we're always
hiring assistants.

144
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:02,926
Yeah, but I thought you didn't

145
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,342
feel super comfortable
doing that.

146
00:10:04,386 --> 00:10:07,868
No, I know. I know I didn't
but my boss loves me.

147
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,367
Like for real, she's
obsessed with me.

148
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:10,740
Yeah.

149
00:10:10,784 --> 00:10:11,891
She said I have to like
tell her about my record.

150
00:10:11,915 --> 00:10:12,936
That's like the whole thing.

151
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,526
Yeah. No, let me talk to her.

152
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:16,026
I'll tell her we went
to art school together.

153
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,399
I'll vouch for you.

154
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:19,793
I mean, it'll be fun.

155
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,098
Really?

156
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:22,056
You're not going back
to Jersey. Fuck that.

157
00:10:22,099 --> 00:10:23,579
Okay. Fuck that.

158
00:10:25,059 --> 00:10:26,147
Thank you.

159
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,670
Of course.

160
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:28,932
All right. Let's get a drink.

161
00:10:28,976 --> 00:10:32,632
Yes. Are you drinking?

162
00:10:32,675 --> 00:10:33,826
I'm drinking, but I don't know.

163
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:35,939
Yeah, I'll have wine.
I'll take it easy.

164
00:10:45,122 --> 00:10:45,906
Whoa!

165
00:10:45,949 --> 00:10:46,950
Oh.

166
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,779
No, no. Come on,
come on, come on.

167
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:58,309
Oh my God.

168
00:10:58,353 --> 00:11:00,268
Oh my God, I'm drunk.

169
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:01,661
Oh my God. Fuck!

170
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,742
Hi. I'm here for the.

171
00:11:39,786 --> 00:11:42,353
Let me see your
driver's license.

172
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:08,597
Who gave you our number?

173
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:10,599
Javier Santos.

174
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:16,779
Can you tell me exactly.

175
00:12:16,823 --> 00:12:17,823
Wait.

176
00:12:23,481 --> 00:12:26,789
Hello, Javier? Do you
know Emily Borato?

177
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:27,790
Moretti.

178
00:12:27,834 --> 00:12:28,704
Boretto.

179
00:12:28,748 --> 00:12:30,227
Moretti.

180
00:12:49,681 --> 00:12:51,596
This kid is really cool though.

181
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,835
He acting like he
don't give a shit.

182
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:56,601
Man, he over here just.

183
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:20,277
Who here has been a
dummy shopper before?

184
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:22,497
Raise your hands but
only if you've done it.

185
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:26,980
You did?

186
00:13:27,023 --> 00:13:28,155
Where? In L.A.?

187
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:29,112
Nah, Milwaukee.

188
00:13:29,156 --> 00:13:30,505
Oh, Milwaukee.

189
00:13:30,548 --> 00:13:31,854
What'd you buy, snow shoes?

190
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:35,118
Nah, like an iPad
Mini. Two iPad Minis.

191
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,076
Good.

192
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:38,208
So for everybody
else, listen up.

193
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:41,516
In the next hour, you
will make 200 cash,

194
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,867
but you will have to
do something illegal.

195
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:45,955
You won't be in danger.

196
00:13:45,999 --> 00:13:47,652
You won't endanger
another person,

197
00:13:47,696 --> 00:13:49,306
but you will be
breaking the law.

198
00:13:50,568 --> 00:13:52,919
So if you're not cool
with that, I get it,

199
00:13:52,962 --> 00:13:54,398
and you can go with any time.

200
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,533
Can I keep going?

201
00:13:58,576 --> 00:14:00,230
Yeah, that's what we want.
Uh huh.

202
00:14:00,274 --> 00:14:01,884
Good.

203
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:03,016
Grab a card, please.

204
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,371
In a few minutes you
will go into a store

205
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:12,068
and buy some merchandise.

206
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:15,985
Any of these flat
screens is okay.

207
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:21,034
Just buy one and
wheel it outside.

208
00:14:22,818 --> 00:14:24,187
We pick up the merchandise
and we pay you.

209
00:14:24,211 --> 00:14:26,517
And that's it for today.

210
00:14:26,561 --> 00:14:27,997
These are stolen, right?

211
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:30,652
The information on
them is stolen. Yes.

212
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:33,481
What? Nah, man.

213
00:14:35,396 --> 00:14:37,746
Fuck that. I can't
fuck with y'all.

214
00:14:39,008 --> 00:14:40,008
Okay.

215
00:14:41,315 --> 00:14:46,320
Look, if you're not
cool with this, great.

216
00:14:46,711 --> 00:14:50,498
Take off and don't bother
calling the police.

217
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,761
We haven't done
anything illegal yet.

218
00:14:52,804 --> 00:14:54,632
They won't even show up. Okay?

219
00:14:54,676 --> 00:14:55,851
I'm cool with it.

220
00:15:00,116 --> 00:15:04,251
Wait, hold on.
What's the problem?

221
00:15:04,294 --> 00:15:09,082
No, it's just, how do
we know the cards work?

222
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:13,086
You don't. That's the hard
part, you have to trust me.

223
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,698
What if they ask for
a driver's license?

224
00:15:16,741 --> 00:15:17,741
Mm.

225
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:26,447
Is that you?

226
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:28,579
Let's make some fucking money.

227
00:16:54,709 --> 00:16:59,714
Yo! Are you gonna pay for that?

228
00:17:01,237 --> 00:17:02,760
I'm sorry?

229
00:17:02,804 --> 00:17:05,894
I said, are you
gonna pay for that?

230
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:09,028
I forgot. Sorry, man.

231
00:17:39,623 --> 00:17:42,844
Tomorrow you have the
option to do another job.

232
00:17:42,887 --> 00:17:44,082
It's a little bit
more complicated.

233
00:17:44,106 --> 00:17:46,543
We'll text you at 1:00 PM, okay?

234
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:47,762
What do I have to do?

235
00:17:49,242 --> 00:17:50,242
Kill someone.

236
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,726
Just kidding. We'll
tell you tomorrow.

237
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,337
All right.

238
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,122
Wait. Don't you want to know
how much you get paid for it?

239
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:02,907
How much?

240
00:18:02,951 --> 00:18:03,951
2,000.

241
00:18:04,605 --> 00:18:05,867
$2,000?

242
00:18:07,608 --> 00:18:09,610
We'll text you,
yes? One o'clock.

243
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:12,612
Sure.

244
00:18:47,648 --> 00:18:49,911
Right there. That's good.

245
00:18:52,392 --> 00:18:53,392
I got it.

246
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,624
You text that number?

247
00:19:10,236 --> 00:19:11,237
Yeah? Yeah.

248
00:19:12,412 --> 00:19:13,412
For real?

249
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:20,202
Hey, did you do another job
for them, like, the next day?

250
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:24,859
Nah, but I was curious though.

251
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:27,426
I was

252
00:19:29,124 --> 00:19:30,125
definitely curious.

253
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,999
Shit's broken or something.

254
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:43,094
What's up? Want me to get it?

255
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:44,008
Nah, I'm good.

256
00:19:44,052 --> 00:19:45,880
You sure? I'm good.

257
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,060
God, damn it!

258
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:57,457
I got you.

259
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,373
I'm not trying to get fired.
Not on my.

260
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:01,504
Shh, chill.

261
00:20:02,462 --> 00:20:04,159
Are we supposed to eat this?

262
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:18,826
Hey, what's going on?

263
00:20:18,869 --> 00:20:20,219
Hey. Oh, are you at work?

264
00:20:20,262 --> 00:20:23,134
Yeah, it's fine. Did
you talk to your boss?

265
00:20:23,178 --> 00:20:24,484
Oh, I'll call you back. Sorry.

266
00:20:24,527 --> 00:20:26,268
No, no, it's good. It's cool.

267
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:28,531
Okay.

268
00:20:28,575 --> 00:20:30,415
Well, so we just hired
some people, apparently.

269
00:20:31,752 --> 00:20:33,710
My boss is being super
weird right now and like.

270
00:20:33,754 --> 00:20:35,712
Did you really talk to her?

271
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:36,756
What? Yeah.

272
00:20:38,106 --> 00:20:39,368
You think I'm lying?

273
00:20:39,412 --> 00:20:40,412
No.

274
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:32,551
Oh, fuck.

275
00:21:42,213 --> 00:21:44,433
It's an hour away.
So, I got to go now.

276
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:46,043
What are you talking about?

277
00:21:46,087 --> 00:21:47,958
Wells Fargo is a half
order, you don't need me.

278
00:21:48,002 --> 00:21:51,179
Nah, you can't ditch out
in the middle of lunch.

279
00:21:51,222 --> 00:21:52,746
I'll throw you my
delivery fee. Okay?

280
00:21:52,789 --> 00:21:54,356
That's 30 bucks right there.

281
00:21:55,401 --> 00:21:57,968
What? Am I driving your car?

282
00:21:58,012 --> 00:22:00,275
I'll take you back to the
kitchen, you grab your car.

283
00:22:21,252 --> 00:22:22,252
Whoa!

284
00:22:32,829 --> 00:22:37,573
These are black cards. They
don't have limit, no limit.

285
00:22:40,184 --> 00:22:42,491
And these, take these, okay?

286
00:22:45,581 --> 00:22:47,888
Just listen to me
and you'll be fine.

287
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,193
Do what I tell you to do.

288
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:00,988
Go to the Southeast
corner of the Plaza.

289
00:23:01,031 --> 00:23:03,425
You'll see a white door,
they'll buzz you in.

290
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:06,254
If you don't know
Southeast, use your phone.

291
00:23:06,297 --> 00:23:07,297
It's just you.

292
00:23:08,212 --> 00:23:09,212
Okay? Okay.

293
00:23:10,084 --> 00:23:12,129
With a purchase of this size,

294
00:23:12,173 --> 00:23:15,568
the bank will call the vendor,
but that takes eight minutes.

295
00:23:15,611 --> 00:23:19,789
So once they run your card, you
have eight minutes to leave.

296
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,835
Eight minutes or
they know it's fake.

297
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,621
How do I know this
is going to be safe?

298
00:23:26,927 --> 00:23:28,494
If you don't want to
do it, don't do it.

299
00:23:28,537 --> 00:23:29,843
Okay? It's up to you.

300
00:24:17,281 --> 00:24:18,631
Hey. Hi.

301
00:24:18,674 --> 00:24:20,589
How are you? Good.

302
00:24:20,633 --> 00:24:21,808
Come inside.

303
00:24:26,247 --> 00:24:28,075
Please, come in.

304
00:24:28,118 --> 00:24:31,426
Okay, so you want to
test drive it, huh?

305
00:24:33,123 --> 00:24:35,386
No, actually my boyfriend
drove it yesterday,

306
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:36,736
so I'm just here.

307
00:24:38,564 --> 00:24:39,564
Here to pick it up.

308
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:43,482
Oh okay. Sit down.

309
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:55,406
So, you don't want
to see the car, huh?

310
00:24:55,450 --> 00:24:56,669
No. I don't need to.

311
00:24:56,712 --> 00:24:59,367
He, like I said, he
drove it yesterday, so.

312
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,761
It's a little
unusual for someone

313
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:03,458
to buy a car without seeing it.

314
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:06,982
Mm.

315
00:25:08,768 --> 00:25:10,073
Okay. Let's do it.

316
00:25:11,074 --> 00:25:12,138
How do you want to pay for it?

317
00:25:12,162 --> 00:25:13,729
Do you have a cashier's check?

318
00:25:13,773 --> 00:25:14,773
Yes.

319
00:25:16,993 --> 00:25:17,993
I've got.

320
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:20,996
Okay.

321
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:29,745
And.

322
00:25:29,789 --> 00:25:32,487
And the rests of the card.

323
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,531
Okay.

324
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:43,106
Let me see your
driver's license.

325
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:44,150
Sure.

326
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:56,119
Jennifer, huh?

327
00:25:57,425 --> 00:25:58,208
Jen.

328
00:25:58,252 --> 00:25:59,645
Okay. Just a moment.

329
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,309
Takes a few seconds.

330
00:26:16,357 --> 00:26:17,445
It's taking its time.

331
00:26:26,628 --> 00:26:27,628
Please sign.

332
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:41,556
There you go.

333
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Thank you.

334
00:26:45,386 --> 00:26:46,648
Hold on a minute.

335
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:49,172
I need you to fill
out this form.

336
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:53,699
This is a waiver that
states we're not responsible

337
00:26:53,742 --> 00:26:56,179
for any mechanical
issues after today.

338
00:26:56,223 --> 00:26:57,223
Sure.

339
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:02,925
Take your time. There's no rush.

340
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:07,669
We just got this car, you know?

341
00:27:07,713 --> 00:27:08,888
Oh yeah?

342
00:27:08,931 --> 00:27:10,343
Yeah, from Mexico.
You don't mind do you?

343
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:11,368
No.

344
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:15,895
Oh, but it's a nice car.

345
00:27:15,938 --> 00:27:18,680
So your name was what,
Jennifer or Jen? Jen?

346
00:27:18,724 --> 00:27:20,029
Sure. Yeah, Jennifer.

347
00:27:20,073 --> 00:27:21,335
I like Jen.

348
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:23,206
Oh okay. You like Jen.

349
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,904
Yeah, Jennifer, no.

350
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:26,645
Jennifer makes you too old.

351
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,168
Oh, we wouldn't want that.

352
00:27:28,211 --> 00:27:31,650
Hey, get my number.
That's the car.

353
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:32,476
You like it?

354
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,520
Yeah.

355
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:37,046
Get my number.

356
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,962
Yeah, I think I
got his number too.

357
00:27:40,006 --> 00:27:41,157
There you go.
Thank you very much.

358
00:27:41,181 --> 00:27:41,964
Enjoy, yeah.

359
00:27:42,008 --> 00:27:43,618
It fits you nice, huh?

360
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,794
Yeah, yeah. You look nice, yeah.

361
00:27:45,838 --> 00:27:46,838
Drive safe.

362
00:28:02,506 --> 00:28:04,073
Just one moment, please.

363
00:28:10,993 --> 00:28:13,387
Hey, we just need to
go back to the office

364
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,475
for just a second.

365
00:28:15,476 --> 00:28:16,869
Why? What's wrong?

366
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:18,087
Nothing. We forgot one thing.

367
00:28:18,131 --> 00:28:20,873
It's just my fault.

368
00:28:20,916 --> 00:28:22,657
You can't tell me what it is?

369
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,659
It's not a big deal, you know?

370
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:28,271
So just, can you turn
off the engine, please?

371
00:28:30,796 --> 00:28:31,796
Turn off the engine.

372
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:41,937
Hey, hey! Don't!

373
00:29:15,101 --> 00:29:18,365
Pull over! Pull the
fucking car over!

374
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:36,383
Fuck.

375
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:38,689
Oh, what the fuck
did I just told you?

376
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:03,192
Hold on. What's this?

377
00:30:03,236 --> 00:30:04,236
Oh shit.

378
00:30:08,632 --> 00:30:09,938
Two grand. Let me see it.

379
00:30:09,982 --> 00:30:10,852
Okay. Okay.

380
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:12,549
Come on. Let's go! Okay!

381
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:13,744
What the fuck are
you staring at?

382
00:30:13,768 --> 00:30:14,769
Give it to me.

383
00:30:17,554 --> 00:30:18,554
What happened?

384
00:30:20,383 --> 00:30:22,777
Dude fucking attack to
me. What do you think?

385
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:25,127
Let me see.

386
00:30:25,171 --> 00:30:26,520
No, don't touch me.

387
00:30:26,563 --> 00:30:28,280
I just want to help, okay?
I thought it was safe.

388
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:30,872
That's why you paid somebody
else to do it, right?

389
00:30:30,916 --> 00:30:31,916
Fuck off!

390
00:30:56,593 --> 00:31:01,598
Hey. Are you okay, huh?

391
00:31:01,642 --> 00:31:03,862
Hey, hey. Breathe.

392
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:05,341
It's okay. You're okay.

393
00:31:05,385 --> 00:31:08,997
Okay, lean, lean forward.
Lean, lean, lean forward.

394
00:31:10,085 --> 00:31:13,784
Okay, good. Come on.

395
00:31:13,828 --> 00:31:14,828
Okay.

396
00:31:20,052 --> 00:31:21,923
Are you okay to drive?

397
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:42,813
You can't make
money another way?

398
00:31:42,857 --> 00:31:44,467
You can make money another way?

399
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:03,051
Make a left up here.

400
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:06,011
Here?

401
00:32:06,054 --> 00:32:07,054
Here.

402
00:32:09,188 --> 00:32:11,712
Okay. You're welcome.

403
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,890
Hey, wait, wait.

404
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,109
Do you want this?

405
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:24,855
Yes?

406
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:27,119
Yes. Thank you very much.

407
00:32:27,162 --> 00:32:28,729
You're welcome.

408
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:30,470
Is your face swelling?

409
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:31,732
What?

410
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:33,952
Your face? You need to
put ice on it, okay?

411
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:34,778
Yeah, I know.

412
00:32:34,822 --> 00:32:35,822
Right away.

413
00:32:37,477 --> 00:32:39,435
But you need to use
the ice cubes. Yes?

414
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,632
Yeah. You think, I don't
know how to do ice?

415
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:44,701
I did not say you don't, okay?

416
00:32:44,745 --> 00:32:45,983
I could help. I could
come up and help.

417
00:32:46,007 --> 00:32:48,314
You want to help put
ice cubes on my face?

418
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,100
Sure.

419
00:33:08,682 --> 00:33:10,510
Here. Thank you.

420
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:12,903
Put it right on your face.

421
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:18,126
You don't have to do that.

422
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:32,987
I told you there isn't any left.

423
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,229
I know.

424
00:33:34,273 --> 00:33:35,056
You got no other booze.

425
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,145
Excuse me, no. It's there.

426
00:33:48,374 --> 00:33:49,375
Excuse me.

427
00:33:51,681 --> 00:33:53,857
Did you make these?

428
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:55,903
Yeah, a long time ago.

429
00:34:11,266 --> 00:34:12,266
Check it out.

430
00:34:14,443 --> 00:34:17,838
I'm going to buy this
place and fix it up.

431
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:21,581
40 units, just like
this, rental properties.

432
00:34:22,669 --> 00:34:24,125
My man, Rahad is
going to sell it to me

433
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:25,498
after he's done renovating.

434
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,198
You're going to buy this?

435
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,242
I am.

436
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:33,766
How much is it?

437
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,120
It's a little down payment.

438
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:40,774
You make that much selling TVs?

439
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:47,041
Sometimes TVs, sometimes
other things as you know.

440
00:34:48,434 --> 00:34:51,915
How much can one person make
if they did what you do?

441
00:34:51,959 --> 00:34:53,439
What I do?

442
00:34:53,482 --> 00:34:54,788
No, I was just wondering.

443
00:34:54,831 --> 00:34:56,398
I mean, I already did it twice.

444
00:34:57,921 --> 00:34:59,619
You could show me how to do it.

445
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:01,490
Why? What's in it for me?

446
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:04,058
I don't know, how
about a free car?

447
00:35:22,598 --> 00:35:24,165
Here.

448
00:35:24,209 --> 00:35:27,168
Keep it. Now you have my number.

449
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:30,779
Adios.

450
00:35:52,628 --> 00:35:54,761
Hey, I'm sorry about
yesterday. All right?

451
00:35:54,804 --> 00:35:56,066
Did it go okay?

452
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,548
Marco wants to talk to you.

453
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:03,639
Hey.

454
00:36:03,683 --> 00:36:05,380
Yo, what happened yesterday?

455
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:07,861
It was an emergency,
okay? I'm really sorry.

456
00:36:07,904 --> 00:36:09,254
Why didn't you call?

457
00:36:09,297 --> 00:36:10,385
I should have.

458
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:14,346
Well, I got to cut
your lunch Wednesday,

459
00:36:14,389 --> 00:36:15,434
Thursday, and Friday.

460
00:36:15,477 --> 00:36:16,628
If you want to
double up on nights.

461
00:36:16,652 --> 00:36:19,220
What, what? Starting this week?

462
00:36:19,264 --> 00:36:20,917
This week. Yeah.

463
00:36:20,961 --> 00:36:23,920
No, you can't take
me off the calendar

464
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:24,878
with no warning, Marco.

465
00:36:24,921 --> 00:36:26,749
I'm sorry, are you an employer?

466
00:36:26,793 --> 00:36:28,925
No, you're an
independent contractor.

467
00:36:28,969 --> 00:36:31,232
So quit talking like you got
rights and go back to work.

468
00:36:31,276 --> 00:36:33,016
Oh my God, dude. We have rights.

469
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,080
Just because we're not employees.

470
00:36:34,104 --> 00:36:35,628
Look, this isn't
a union in house.

471
00:36:35,671 --> 00:36:38,935
Call your shop steward
then. All right?

472
00:36:38,979 --> 00:36:41,242
You got a union shop
steward, call them,

473
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:42,678
if not go back to work.

474
00:36:57,563 --> 00:37:02,568
So I can give you numbers, but
I can't make cards for you.

475
00:37:02,785 --> 00:37:04,526
I do not have the time.

476
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:08,574
But it's easy.

477
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:11,358
Watch.

478
00:37:14,884 --> 00:37:16,016
Here's the numbers.

479
00:37:24,938 --> 00:37:26,069
Here's the cards.

480
00:37:56,361 --> 00:37:57,144
Okay.

481
00:37:57,187 --> 00:37:58,319
Now, you scan the magnet.

482
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:07,066
Now you try.

483
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:11,244
Fucker.

484
00:38:15,597 --> 00:38:17,164
When you did it,
it looked so easy.

485
00:38:20,733 --> 00:38:22,300
Okay, wait, wait. Look, look.

486
00:38:23,388 --> 00:38:24,911
Pull it hard like this.

487
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,577
We sell to a couple of vendors.

488
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,057
They keep us on
payroll like salary,

489
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:43,843
but you can sell online,
Craigslist, whatever.

490
00:38:43,886 --> 00:38:45,671
Yeah, that's a bad idea, right?

491
00:38:45,714 --> 00:38:48,543
I mean, none of this
is safe technically,

492
00:38:48,587 --> 00:38:51,546
but if you listen to exactly
what they say, you'll be fine.

493
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,898
Don't mess with ATMs. Okay?

494
00:38:55,942 --> 00:38:57,857
Don't meet customers
at your home.

495
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,339
And the most important thing,
don't go to the same store

496
00:39:01,382 --> 00:39:02,601
more than once in a week.

497
00:39:03,863 --> 00:39:05,560
You'll be dealing
with lots of cash.

498
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:07,170
What do you use for protection?

499
00:39:08,433 --> 00:39:09,433
Pepper spray.

500
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,219
No good. I got
something for you.

501
00:39:14,526 --> 00:39:16,615
Whoa, what do you mean?

502
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:19,618
What is that?

503
00:39:19,661 --> 00:39:22,751
This.

504
00:39:26,451 --> 00:39:30,106
If you make less than
$5,000, keep it, you're done.

505
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:34,894
Okay. And what if I make more?

506
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:35,895
If you make more?

507
00:39:35,938 --> 00:39:36,938
Yeah.

508
00:39:38,419 --> 00:39:41,727
Then you hit me up and
we'll take things further.

509
00:40:45,965 --> 00:40:46,965
Shit.

510
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:57,629
Hey, Michael, are
you still coming?

511
00:41:04,592 --> 00:41:06,333
So, it's $600?

512
00:41:06,376 --> 00:41:09,118
Six? No, it's $300.

513
00:41:09,162 --> 00:41:10,772
No, $600.

514
00:41:10,816 --> 00:41:12,034
You said three online.

515
00:41:14,428 --> 00:41:17,692
No, no, I texted you
six. I'll show you.

516
00:41:20,216 --> 00:41:21,566
$300.

517
00:41:21,609 --> 00:41:23,524
For real man. We're
in broad daylight?

518
00:41:23,568 --> 00:41:25,744
Oh, what's up? You
gonna call the police?

519
00:41:25,787 --> 00:41:27,963
I mean, we could just
steal the shit for free.

520
00:41:29,225 --> 00:41:30,357
All right. All right.

521
00:41:32,098 --> 00:41:32,881
$300.

522
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:34,230
Sure. No worries.

523
00:41:40,149 --> 00:41:42,630
Come on, now. Where
are you going?

524
00:41:42,674 --> 00:41:45,024
Hold up. Hold up.

525
00:41:45,067 --> 00:41:46,547
$600, yes or no?

526
00:41:48,027 --> 00:41:50,769
$350. Hey, where are you going?

527
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,473
What else you got?

528
00:42:47,042 --> 00:42:48,174
Cool, man.

529
00:42:48,217 --> 00:42:49,217
Thank you.

530
00:43:06,496 --> 00:43:07,889
So, fucking insane.

531
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:09,345
It's like my favorite
color. You know it's green?

532
00:43:09,369 --> 00:43:13,460
And so I thought, why
can't I have a color party.

533
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:14,679
You know what I'm saying?

534
00:43:14,722 --> 00:43:16,506
Okay, so you got my email.

535
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,857
So you know everything
you need to do.

536
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,946
The only thing is
he's crate training,

537
00:43:20,989 --> 00:43:22,556
so he has to sleep in the crate.

538
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,794
Okay, got it.
He doesn't like it.

539
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:25,341
But just, you know,
shove him in there.

540
00:43:25,385 --> 00:43:26,385
Hey buddy.

541
00:43:27,126 --> 00:43:28,649
Hey, I'm sorry about the job.

542
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:30,869
It's fine.

543
00:43:30,912 --> 00:43:32,237
I can hook you up. I
know I can hook you up.

544
00:43:32,261 --> 00:43:34,022
I just got to wait for
the right time, you know?

545
00:43:34,046 --> 00:43:35,264
Totally.

546
00:43:35,308 --> 00:43:37,310
But we can talk about
it when I get back.

547
00:43:37,353 --> 00:43:38,137
Okay.

548
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:39,834
Okay. All right, baby.

549
00:43:39,878 --> 00:43:42,968
Mama's gotta go to work.
I'm going to go to Portugal.

550
00:43:43,011 --> 00:43:44,491
Yeah.

551
00:43:44,534 --> 00:43:46,058
Love you.

552
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,538
I'm really gonna miss him.

553
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:49,365
Aww.

554
00:43:49,409 --> 00:43:50,584
And you too. I love you.

555
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,890
Thank you so much.

556
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:53,674
Okay. Be safe. Yeah, you too.

557
00:43:53,718 --> 00:43:55,371
If he's bad, you know, you
just smack him.

558
00:43:55,415 --> 00:43:56,415
No.

559
00:44:53,473 --> 00:44:58,478
Okay, I'm going to hook you
up with more numbers. Yeah?

560
00:44:59,218 --> 00:45:01,350
Bigger accounts. Bigger limits.

561
00:45:01,394 --> 00:45:02,525
Okay?

562
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:03,613
Okay.

563
00:45:03,657 --> 00:45:04,702
Yeah?

564
00:45:04,745 --> 00:45:05,964
Yeah.

565
00:45:06,007 --> 00:45:08,270
Sit, please. This could
take a minute. Okay?

566
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:19,717
I like your office.

567
00:45:22,154 --> 00:45:23,024
Oh yeah?

568
00:45:23,068 --> 00:45:27,899
Yes. The Feng Shui, it's just.

569
00:45:27,942 --> 00:45:32,773
Yeah, it's good,

570
00:45:32,817 --> 00:45:34,949
because I installed
all the lights myself.

571
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:36,211
I did the lighting design.

572
00:45:36,255 --> 00:45:37,647
Oh, is that right? Yeah. Yeah.

573
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:39,475
It's good. I like it.

574
00:45:39,519 --> 00:45:40,519
Okay.

575
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,264
I fucking hate this
place. I hate it.

576
00:45:47,048 --> 00:45:49,616
But just a little more.

577
00:45:49,659 --> 00:45:52,097
Well it's only temporary, right?

578
00:46:09,505 --> 00:46:10,419
This is my cousin Khalil.

579
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:12,291
Khalil, this is Emily.

580
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:16,164
Nice to meet you again.

581
00:46:16,208 --> 00:46:17,644
Nice to meet you too again.

582
00:46:18,993 --> 00:46:22,170
Oh, she forgot her phone
at the meeting Thursday.

583
00:46:22,214 --> 00:46:24,433
So, she came to.

584
00:46:29,438 --> 00:46:30,657
You left your phone?

585
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:31,700
Yeah.

586
00:46:43,365 --> 00:46:45,367
Just give me one second, please.

587
00:46:45,411 --> 00:46:46,411
Yes? Okay.

588
00:47:02,123 --> 00:47:04,560
I'm sorry I was late. Okay?

589
00:47:06,345 --> 00:47:08,956
I'm gonna take you for a walk.

590
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:10,131
I'm going to feed you.

591
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:15,571
'Cause that's what
I'm supposed to do.

592
00:47:22,535 --> 00:47:23,535
Hello?

593
00:47:26,104 --> 00:47:27,583
Yeah. It's still available.

594
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:31,326
Yeah. I'm just in a
different spot right now.

595
00:47:33,981 --> 00:47:36,157
8216 Core Team Place.

596
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:09,103
Hey, excuse me.

597
00:48:09,147 --> 00:48:10,365
Hey. Hi.

598
00:48:10,409 --> 00:48:14,021
We almost caught, we
were across the street.

599
00:48:14,065 --> 00:48:16,371
Look, I'm Chip up
here for the Samsung.

600
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:19,853
I mean, you know, we
drove all the way across.

601
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,115
Yeah, yeah. Cool, yeah.

602
00:48:21,159 --> 00:48:22,571
Just stay right there,
and give me one second.

603
00:48:22,595 --> 00:48:23,964
No, no. We came all
across town, man.

604
00:48:23,988 --> 00:48:25,182
And, you know, I just
want to get it and go.

605
00:48:25,206 --> 00:48:25,990
One second.

606
00:48:26,033 --> 00:48:27,556
Is it right there though?

607
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,186
No, it's not. I'll be
right back, all right?

608
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,777
Let me give you a hand.

609
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:31,885
Yeah, I'll be right
back, all right?

610
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:34,781
No, no I'm just
giving you a hand.

611
00:48:39,699 --> 00:48:41,266
Stay still. Stay still!

612
00:48:45,444 --> 00:48:46,444
You feel that?

613
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,664
Yeah.

614
00:48:48,708 --> 00:48:51,102
We know what you're
doing? We know what's up.

615
00:48:51,145 --> 00:48:53,887
You do what I say or I'll
slit your throat. Okay?

616
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,150
Huh? Yes!

617
00:48:56,194 --> 00:48:57,935
Okay? Do you want understand me?

618
00:48:57,978 --> 00:48:58,892
Yes.

619
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:02,156
All right. Where's the cash at?

620
00:49:03,331 --> 00:49:04,613
I don't have any cash
here. I swear to God.

621
00:49:04,637 --> 00:49:08,336
Hey! Hey, hey, this
could be super easy.

622
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,949
Just tell us everything.
That's all you got to do.

623
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:20,261
There's a safe in
the bedroom closet. All right?

624
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:23,786
Bedroom on the left, on the
right. Bedroom on the right.

625
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:32,230
Hello.

626
00:49:32,273 --> 00:49:35,450
You're just the cutest.
You wanna go for a ride?

627
00:49:37,322 --> 00:49:38,322
Good boy.

628
00:49:46,461 --> 00:49:47,767
What the hell is that?

629
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,161
It has a combination lock on it.

630
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:51,771
Okay, open it up. Let's go!

631
00:49:51,814 --> 00:49:52,814
Okay.

632
00:50:04,349 --> 00:50:06,481
Oh my God. Are those hundreds?

633
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:09,832
It's gotta be like
10, 15 grand in here.

634
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:11,138
Bag that shit up.

635
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:15,447
Let's go. Let's go.

636
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:16,770
I'm gonna borrow
your dog, bitch.

637
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:21,279
Yeah. Are you scared of me?

638
00:50:23,281 --> 00:50:24,151
Hmm?

639
00:50:24,195 --> 00:50:26,110
Yes.

640
00:50:26,153 --> 00:50:27,153
Yeah.

641
00:50:31,941 --> 00:50:34,596
We know where you live.

642
00:50:57,315 --> 00:50:58,315
No.

643
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:03,190
No, no, no!

644
00:51:23,254 --> 00:51:24,254
Hey.

645
00:51:25,691 --> 00:51:27,214
Chip, what the hell? Chip?

646
00:51:27,258 --> 00:51:28,433
Get out of the car.

647
00:51:28,476 --> 00:51:30,174
No. Get out of the fucking car!

648
00:51:30,217 --> 00:51:33,481
Wait, wait, wait.
Please, no, no, no!

649
00:51:36,180 --> 00:51:37,268
Stay still. Okay?

650
00:51:43,317 --> 00:51:45,580
Pauline Carper,
1186 Mirada Drive.

651
00:51:45,624 --> 00:51:47,147
Yeah, yeah. Right?

652
00:51:47,191 --> 00:51:48,148
Glendora. That's where you live?

653
00:51:48,192 --> 00:51:49,236
Yeah.

654
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:50,150
Okay, you might
know where I live,

655
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:51,151
but I know where you live too.

656
00:51:51,195 --> 00:51:52,196
You understand? Yeah.

657
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,719
You understand what I'm saying?

658
00:52:07,689 --> 00:52:08,995
Yes!

659
00:52:09,038 --> 00:52:12,390
What's up?

660
00:52:12,433 --> 00:52:14,131
Oh, you look sexy.

661
00:52:14,174 --> 00:52:15,436
Thank you. Hi, my baby!

662
00:52:16,655 --> 00:52:17,786
I missed you.

663
00:52:17,830 --> 00:52:20,180
Thank you, fuck, so
much. How was it?

664
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,747
How was what?

665
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:22,574
Barton.

666
00:52:22,617 --> 00:52:24,489
Oh yeah, he's no problem.

667
00:52:24,532 --> 00:52:25,925
Oh, thank God.

668
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:27,927
He's normally such
a fucking asshole.

669
00:52:27,970 --> 00:52:28,970
Oh, not with me.

670
00:52:30,016 --> 00:52:33,324
Emily, this is Taylor.
The Taylor from work.

671
00:52:33,367 --> 00:52:34,934
Oh. This is Brendan.

672
00:52:34,977 --> 00:52:36,544
They do our copy writing.

673
00:52:36,588 --> 00:52:38,024
Guys, this is Emily.

674
00:52:38,067 --> 00:52:43,072
Emily and I went to high
school together in the 973

675
00:52:43,116 --> 00:52:44,857
and we went to art
school together, so.

676
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,381
97, what is that? An area code?

677
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:48,339
Newark.

678
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:50,341
Okay. Well I'm scared now.

679
00:52:50,384 --> 00:52:51,342
You really should be.

680
00:52:51,385 --> 00:52:52,343
You should we scared.

681
00:52:52,386 --> 00:52:53,518
Taylor? Oh, okay.

682
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:54,561
You guys.

683
00:53:00,438 --> 00:53:02,788
What kind of art do you do?

684
00:53:02,831 --> 00:53:04,398
Um.

685
00:53:04,442 --> 00:53:05,723
Sorry, Liz told me
you're an artist.

686
00:53:05,747 --> 00:53:07,836
Oh yeah, no I, yeah, no.

687
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:10,361
I haven't done anything
in a long time art wise.

688
00:53:10,404 --> 00:53:11,404
Oh, okay.

689
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:16,758
All right. What do you do then?

690
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:23,287
Credit card fraud.

691
00:53:40,608 --> 00:53:42,654
Hey, are you Emily?

692
00:53:42,697 --> 00:53:43,785
Yeah.

693
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:45,309
There's a guy outside
looking for you.

694
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:58,583
Hey, I didn't think
you got my text.

695
00:53:59,584 --> 00:54:01,455
I wasn't far away, so.

696
00:54:05,677 --> 00:54:06,677
Hello.

697
00:54:07,766 --> 00:54:08,549
Hi.

698
00:54:08,593 --> 00:54:10,856
This is my friend, Youcef.

699
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:12,249
Hi. Liz.

700
00:54:12,292 --> 00:54:14,033
Oh, hello. It's very
nice to meet you.

701
00:54:14,076 --> 00:54:15,184
Thank you. Thanks for coming.

702
00:54:15,208 --> 00:54:16,775
Liz, yes? Liz?

703
00:54:16,818 --> 00:54:17,818
Yep.

704
00:54:19,212 --> 00:54:20,387
Is it your birthday, Liz?

705
00:54:20,431 --> 00:54:22,737
No, I just got back
from a trip, so.

706
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,044
I'll be on the dance floor.

707
00:54:25,087 --> 00:54:26,393
All right. We'll see you then.

708
00:54:30,528 --> 00:54:33,226
Do you know all these people?

709
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,270
No, not really.

710
00:54:36,751 --> 00:54:37,751
Nobody?

711
00:54:38,797 --> 00:54:42,627
No. They all work with
Liz at the ad agency.

712
00:54:52,114 --> 00:54:54,508
Do you want me to pretend
to be your boyfriend?

713
00:54:57,468 --> 00:55:00,601
Sure. Okay.

714
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:03,777
Like this?

715
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:18,663
Hey, hey, hey.

716
00:55:19,838 --> 00:55:24,799
Okay, so Sarah just put
in her two week notice.

717
00:55:24,973 --> 00:55:27,367
My boss just texted
me right now and asked

718
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:31,066
if I know anyone, like,
this just happened.

719
00:55:32,459 --> 00:55:34,418
Do you still want to interview?

720
00:55:34,461 --> 00:55:36,158
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

721
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:37,116
Yes. Yeah.

722
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:38,726
Just come by.

723
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:40,661
Can you come by the office and
I'll prep you on everything

724
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:42,774
like Tuesday at 11?

725
00:55:42,817 --> 00:55:45,516
Yeah, definitely.
Definitely, yeah.

726
00:55:45,559 --> 00:55:47,126
Okay. What did I tell you?

727
00:55:47,169 --> 00:55:48,257
Yeah, girl.

728
00:55:49,607 --> 00:55:51,304
See you in the back.

729
00:57:38,367 --> 00:57:41,109
Oh, they finished the painting.

730
00:57:42,197 --> 00:57:43,197
Good.

731
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:04,002
See, what I want to do is I
want to shorten this wall.

732
00:58:04,045 --> 00:58:06,352
Yes? Put the bar here.

733
00:58:07,309 --> 00:58:09,486
So the living room
and the kitchen

734
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:11,966
is like one big open space.

735
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:13,054
Nice. Yes?

736
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:18,886
For all four units,
we'll do the same thing.

737
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:21,933
We're going to put this up.

738
00:58:24,805 --> 00:58:26,677
Yeah, but do you
own this place yet?

739
00:58:28,287 --> 00:58:30,289
Soon.

740
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:31,333
Soon.

741
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:42,606
Si.

742
00:58:42,649 --> 00:58:43,476
Si.

743
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:44,520
Si.

744
00:58:47,524 --> 00:58:49,787
So if you had some
money, what would you do?

745
00:58:51,092 --> 00:58:52,092
Pay a loan?

746
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:55,706
Yeah, I would definitely
do that first.

747
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:56,881
What about your art?

748
00:58:59,753 --> 00:59:00,885
Would you do your art?

749
00:59:02,626 --> 00:59:06,281
Yeah, I would make art for sure.

750
00:59:06,325 --> 00:59:08,545
I would paint. I love painting.

751
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,547
It makes me happy.

752
00:59:13,767 --> 00:59:14,767
What else?

753
00:59:19,077 --> 00:59:21,601
I mean, I don't know.

754
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:23,951
I just want to be
free, you know?

755
00:59:23,995 --> 00:59:28,608
I just want to be able
to experience things.

756
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:31,742
I want to travel.

757
00:59:31,785 --> 00:59:33,831
I want to live in another
country for awhile.

758
00:59:33,874 --> 00:59:35,746
Like, I got a long list, like,

759
00:59:35,789 --> 00:59:37,878
I really want to go
to South America like.

760
00:59:37,922 --> 00:59:41,360
So, go. So, go.

761
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:42,187
You can go.

762
00:59:42,230 --> 00:59:43,362
Yeah, no. I can't just go.

763
00:59:43,405 --> 00:59:46,452
Sure. Sure you can.

764
00:59:46,495 --> 00:59:50,412
I did. I left my home
and it was crazy.

765
00:59:51,849 --> 00:59:52,893
Do you miss it?

766
00:59:52,937 --> 00:59:54,503
Yeah, sure. Of course.

767
00:59:58,682 --> 01:00:00,074
Now you're here.

768
01:00:00,118 --> 01:00:01,685
Now I'm here.

769
01:00:01,728 --> 01:00:05,384
I was hoping you could do
something for me like a favor.

770
01:00:05,427 --> 01:00:06,298
Yeah? I'd owe you.

771
01:00:06,341 --> 01:00:07,865
I swear to God.

772
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,518
What is it?

773
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:11,782
Don't freak out,
seriously. I'd owe you.

774
01:00:16,003 --> 01:00:17,004
Okay?

775
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:17,831
Okay.

776
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:18,658
Say yes.

777
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:19,702
No.

778
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:23,141
Maybe you button
up your sweater.

779
01:00:23,184 --> 01:00:23,968
Really?

780
01:00:24,011 --> 01:00:25,011
Please, yes.

781
01:00:28,059 --> 01:00:28,799
Hey, mama.

782
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:30,627
So happy to see you.

783
01:00:32,193 --> 01:00:33,455
So, happy. Ma.

784
01:00:34,587 --> 01:00:37,024
Hi. Nice to meet you.

785
01:00:37,068 --> 01:00:38,547
Three kisses.

786
01:00:38,591 --> 01:00:41,420
Ah, come on in.

787
01:00:41,463 --> 01:00:44,902
Oh no, no, no, no, no, not this.

788
01:00:44,945 --> 01:00:46,643
Yes. No.

789
01:00:46,686 --> 01:00:48,775
Ancient Lebanon tradition.

790
01:00:48,819 --> 01:00:49,646
Really?

791
01:00:49,689 --> 01:00:51,952
No, that's Italiano.

792
01:00:51,996 --> 01:00:54,041
She just wants to drink
that shit with somebody.

793
01:00:54,085 --> 01:00:55,347
That's not Lebanese.

794
01:00:55,390 --> 01:00:56,914
I'll drink with you.

795
01:00:56,957 --> 01:00:57,784
Oh, of course.

796
01:00:57,828 --> 01:00:59,046
He cannot drink.

797
01:01:00,004 --> 01:01:02,441
He takes tiny little shit sips.

798
01:01:03,572 --> 01:01:04,593
I don't take little shit sips.

799
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:07,315
Tiny little baby
sips. I show you.

800
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:08,447
Tiny little baby sips?

801
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:09,578
Like this.

802
01:01:12,756 --> 01:01:14,801
No ones' even said that.

803
01:01:14,845 --> 01:01:15,672
Okay.

804
01:01:15,715 --> 01:01:16,498
Here we go. Here we go.

805
01:01:16,542 --> 01:01:17,542
One, two.

806
01:01:18,413 --> 01:01:20,024
You don't even do it!

807
01:01:20,067 --> 01:01:21,199
Come on, one, two.

808
01:01:21,242 --> 01:01:22,026
Don't worry about me.

809
01:01:22,069 --> 01:01:22,983
One, two, three.

810
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:24,811
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

811
01:01:28,554 --> 01:01:30,164
Ooh! It tastes so bad.

812
01:01:31,209 --> 01:01:32,601
He buys me an apartment.

813
01:01:32,645 --> 01:01:35,213
Have you seen much
better than here?

814
01:01:35,256 --> 01:01:37,432
I have seen, it's very nice.

815
01:01:37,476 --> 01:01:40,914
He makes promise all his
life, now he does it.

816
01:01:41,828 --> 01:01:45,310
He will become
successful businessman.

817
01:01:46,441 --> 01:01:49,444
I know this. I know.

818
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:52,143
He does what ever
it takes. My Youcef.

819
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,974
So what do you do in life?

820
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:01,805
I'm not sure yet.

821
01:02:01,848 --> 01:02:04,503
You don't know? It's okay.

822
01:02:04,546 --> 01:02:09,029
You will figure out your
gift. God will give you gift.

823
01:02:09,073 --> 01:02:12,293
My gift was making man.

824
01:02:13,817 --> 01:02:17,124
Maybe, Emily the teacher.

825
01:02:17,168 --> 01:02:20,954
Emily the mother.
Emily the something.

826
01:02:27,091 --> 01:02:29,920
Very nice. Really nice day.

827
01:02:32,705 --> 01:02:37,536
Ah, mama. I missed you.

828
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:44,108
I have more things in the
oven. Sit down, sit down.

829
01:02:50,592 --> 01:02:52,943
I didn't know you were coming.

830
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:55,380
I'm just in a neighborhood.

831
01:03:00,037 --> 01:03:01,037
I hold a video.

832
01:03:03,431 --> 01:03:04,519
What's that?

833
01:03:04,563 --> 01:03:05,825
Ah, show him.

834
01:03:09,220 --> 01:03:12,963
Right there, huh? Same
store twice in one week.

835
01:03:13,964 --> 01:03:17,576
So they put it on the website
like that. Linden police.

836
01:03:19,970 --> 01:03:22,799
Did you drive your own car
with your own license plate?

837
01:03:22,842 --> 01:03:23,669
I don't think it means anything.

838
01:03:23,712 --> 01:03:28,543
No? Well, it's Emily, right?

839
01:03:29,457 --> 01:03:30,457
Right.

840
01:03:31,198 --> 01:03:35,942
If they find you, they
might find us. Understand?

841
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:37,291
Huh? Sure.

842
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:38,597
You understand? I understand.

843
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,338
Okay. Look, maybe
we go to somewhere.

844
01:03:40,381 --> 01:03:41,381
No. You lied.

845
01:03:42,296 --> 01:03:45,125
You told me it was a
one time thing with her.

846
01:03:45,169 --> 01:03:46,474
Are you fucking
her yet at least?

847
01:03:46,518 --> 01:03:47,562
That's enough.

848
01:03:47,606 --> 01:03:48,607
Okay. That's enough.

849
01:03:48,650 --> 01:03:50,217
At least one of
us is benefiting.

850
01:03:50,261 --> 01:03:51,349
Excuse me?

851
01:03:51,392 --> 01:03:52,306
Yes.

852
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:53,873
What'd you just say?

853
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:55,744
You cannot hear well?

854
01:03:55,788 --> 01:03:58,312
Yeah, I heard what you
said. Say it again.

855
01:03:58,356 --> 01:04:00,358
Go ahead. Go ahead.

856
01:04:00,401 --> 01:04:02,969
I like her. She has
bigger balls than you.

857
01:04:03,013 --> 01:04:06,190
I have wonderful things
for you to eat, eat.

858
01:04:07,539 --> 01:04:09,125
What is happening that
nobody's eating here?

859
01:04:09,149 --> 01:04:10,063
Oh, yes.

860
01:04:10,107 --> 01:04:11,543
Wow. Those look good.

861
01:04:11,586 --> 01:04:14,633
I want people to eat
and feel calm, happy.

862
01:04:28,908 --> 01:04:29,908
Emily?

863
01:04:30,736 --> 01:04:31,650
Hi. Hey.

864
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:32,693
Hey!

865
01:04:33,521 --> 01:04:36,611
Oh! The blazer, bold choice.

866
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:37,874
Oh yeah. Is it too much?

867
01:04:37,917 --> 01:04:39,416
No, I love it.
It's the only jacket I have.

868
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:40,441
It's very 80s.

869
01:04:40,485 --> 01:04:42,879
So this is how I
do the scheduling.

870
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:45,142
It's just one Google doc
for the entire company

871
01:04:45,185 --> 01:04:46,491
and basically it's open format.

872
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:48,101
So anyone can go
in and make changes

873
01:04:48,145 --> 01:04:49,755
but realistically
nobody does that.

874
01:04:49,798 --> 01:04:52,497
So I'm kind of in charge of
keeping everything on point

875
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:53,648
for about 50 employees, right?

876
01:04:53,672 --> 01:04:55,630
I think it's 55 now.

877
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:56,936
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:58,895
Including assistance and
everything like that.

879
01:04:58,938 --> 01:05:00,940
So basically it's going
to be these six columns

880
01:05:00,984 --> 01:05:02,787
that you want to make sure
that everything is correct.

881
01:05:02,811 --> 01:05:04,659
This last column is going
to be the most important.

882
01:05:04,683 --> 01:05:06,946
And by Friday, everything
needs to be pretty much set.

883
01:05:06,990 --> 01:05:08,121
So you're going to need.

884
01:05:08,165 --> 01:05:09,403
Now, you're gonna
kill the interview.

885
01:05:09,427 --> 01:05:11,342
E-mail all the bosses,
CC every Assistant,

886
01:05:11,385 --> 01:05:12,169
all that good stuff.

887
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:13,083
Thank you so much, Sarah.

888
01:05:13,126 --> 01:05:13,953
Yeah, of course you.

889
01:05:13,997 --> 01:05:15,172
I'm gonna miss you.

890
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:16,714
Oh, I know, I'm gonna
miss you guys too.

891
01:05:16,738 --> 01:05:18,262
Hey, you want to get lunch?

892
01:05:18,305 --> 01:05:19,567
Right now? Yeah.

893
01:05:19,611 --> 01:05:21,110
Yeah. There's this ramen
place around the corner.

894
01:05:21,134 --> 01:05:23,354
It is ruining my
life. It's so good.

895
01:05:23,397 --> 01:05:26,487
But I just need 10.
So, I'll be right back.

896
01:05:26,531 --> 01:05:27,619
Yeah, cool.

897
01:05:57,997 --> 01:05:58,997
Hey.

898
01:05:59,694 --> 01:06:01,000
Let's go.

899
01:06:01,044 --> 01:06:02,219
What happened?

900
01:06:02,262 --> 01:06:03,742
Let's go. Let's drive.

901
01:06:03,785 --> 01:06:04,961
Hey, you're bleeding.

902
01:06:06,353 --> 01:06:07,548
Here. There's some
tissue in here.

903
01:06:07,572 --> 01:06:09,748
Drive the car.

904
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:11,968
All right, fine.

905
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:18,322
I'm fucking done.

906
01:06:18,365 --> 01:06:19,279
I'm done with Khalil.

907
01:06:19,323 --> 01:06:20,889
So, quit.

908
01:06:20,933 --> 01:06:24,197
Five months, five months!
He hasn't paid me a thing.

909
01:06:24,241 --> 01:06:25,242
He's not paying you?

910
01:06:25,285 --> 01:06:26,565
And now Rahad calls and tells me

911
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:28,177
he needs the down payment
for the apartment.

912
01:06:28,201 --> 01:06:31,639
He needs it now, that
there's a cash offer

913
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:33,511
from a Chinese company.

914
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,384
I tell Khalil, you
know what he say?

915
01:06:38,211 --> 01:06:39,647
You know what he say?

916
01:06:39,691 --> 01:06:41,910
He says you work with Emily
now. Why you come to me?

917
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,260
So, look.

918
01:06:47,351 --> 01:06:49,614
Listen, tomorrow, first thing,

919
01:06:51,529 --> 01:06:55,620
I'm hitting the storage
units then the office.

920
01:06:55,663 --> 01:06:57,926
I'm going to clean up all
the cash that's there,

921
01:06:59,537 --> 01:07:00,668
then the bank account.

922
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:04,237
We have a business account.

923
01:07:04,281 --> 01:07:06,500
I'm going to empty
it as much as I can.

924
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:08,763
Jesus.

925
01:07:08,807 --> 01:07:10,156
Are you in?

926
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:11,418
Am I in?

927
01:07:11,462 --> 01:07:12,767
We're working together.

928
01:07:12,811 --> 01:07:16,119
Yeah, but that's like a
whole other thing. Okay?

929
01:07:18,077 --> 01:07:20,688
I don't know if I could,

930
01:07:20,732 --> 01:07:22,057
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

931
01:07:22,081 --> 01:07:27,043
Even if I do this alone,
he's going to blame you.

932
01:07:29,741 --> 01:07:31,482
How much do you want?

933
01:07:37,662 --> 01:07:40,534
Oh my God. So you're
just going to rob him?

934
01:07:42,667 --> 01:07:43,667
Yes.

935
01:07:45,974 --> 01:07:46,974
You take a cut.

936
01:07:48,629 --> 01:07:49,630
All your debts paid.

937
01:07:52,938 --> 01:07:56,072
You can travel. Get to
a new place, whatever.

938
01:07:58,683 --> 01:08:03,688
But listen, if you're
going to do this,

939
01:08:04,863 --> 01:08:06,299
you have to be in for real.

940
01:08:09,041 --> 01:08:14,046
For real.

941
01:08:34,153 --> 01:08:35,981
No. Stay here.

942
01:08:36,024 --> 01:08:37,852
No, I gotta go to an interview.

943
01:09:05,967 --> 01:09:07,491
Hi.

944
01:09:07,534 --> 01:09:10,450
Ah, there she is.

945
01:09:10,494 --> 01:09:11,930
Hey, it's so great to meet you.

946
01:09:11,973 --> 01:09:13,410
Hi. Thanks for coming in.

947
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:15,499
Good to meet you too.
Thanks for having me.

948
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:17,153
Ooh, I like your accent.

949
01:09:17,196 --> 01:09:18,893
You're clearly not
from the west coast.

950
01:09:18,937 --> 01:09:21,635
No, I am from New Jersey.

951
01:09:21,679 --> 01:09:23,071
Where?

952
01:09:23,115 --> 01:09:24,160
Bayonne.

953
01:09:24,203 --> 01:09:25,161
Hoboken.

954
01:09:25,204 --> 01:09:26,118
Oh, nice.

955
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,356
Yeah. Where'd you go to school?

956
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,381
HBS.

957
01:09:28,425 --> 01:09:30,601
Junior Senior,
Ninth and Clinton.

958
01:09:30,644 --> 01:09:32,646
Oh yeah. I know Junior Senior.

959
01:09:34,082 --> 01:09:36,955
So you're familiar
with the company.

960
01:09:36,998 --> 01:09:39,523
I don't have to go through
the whole sales pitch.

961
01:09:43,135 --> 01:09:47,705
So you left college
before you finished?

962
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:49,750
Yes.

963
01:09:49,794 --> 01:09:50,794
Why?

964
01:09:52,231 --> 01:09:53,580
I got a felony conviction.

965
01:09:55,756 --> 01:09:57,845
So why didn't you go
to school afterwards

966
01:09:57,889 --> 01:09:59,673
or a community college?

967
01:09:59,717 --> 01:10:02,154
I wanted to, but you know,

968
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:06,550
I had legal fees, and student
loans, and living expenses.

969
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:10,162
I had to take care of my
grandmother, so I had to work.

970
01:10:14,427 --> 01:10:15,907
Okay.

971
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,343
All right.

972
01:10:17,387 --> 01:10:21,956
So what we're looking for
here is a design intern.

973
01:10:22,087 --> 01:10:24,263
Does that sound
appealing to you?

974
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:25,307
Definitely. Yeah.

975
01:10:26,483 --> 01:10:27,527
Good. Yeah.

976
01:10:28,485 --> 01:10:31,009
Sorry. Is that a,
you say intern,

977
01:10:31,052 --> 01:10:33,098
is it a job or an internship?

978
01:10:35,361 --> 01:10:37,624
Well, all my
assistants are interns.

979
01:10:40,105 --> 01:10:42,542
So is it, sorry. Is
that a paid position?

980
01:10:44,892 --> 01:10:46,851
Not at first.

981
01:10:46,894 --> 01:10:49,070
The way it works is the
first five or six months,

982
01:10:49,114 --> 01:10:52,509
you get to know the business
and if you do a great job,

983
01:10:52,552 --> 01:10:54,511
then I'd love to
discuss it with you.

984
01:10:54,554 --> 01:10:55,554
Right.

985
01:10:57,514 --> 01:11:01,300
Sorry. I'm just trying to
wrap my head around that.

986
01:11:01,344 --> 01:11:02,867
So what are the hours?

987
01:11:04,129 --> 01:11:05,261
Regular hours.

988
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:15,662
You do realize this is a
very competitive position?

989
01:11:15,706 --> 01:11:17,185
Yeah, sure. I understand that.

990
01:11:17,229 --> 01:11:19,294
What I don't understand is
how you feel so comfortable

991
01:11:19,318 --> 01:11:21,059
asking someone to
work without pay.

992
01:11:21,973 --> 01:11:24,018
You know, when I was your age,

993
01:11:24,062 --> 01:11:25,933
they told me all I could
be was a secretary.

994
01:11:25,977 --> 01:11:27,718
Okay. But secretaries get paid.

995
01:11:27,761 --> 01:11:29,285
That's not the point.

996
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:31,437
Well, when you were my age,
do you have $60,000 of debt?

997
01:11:31,461 --> 01:11:32,636
How about this?

998
01:11:32,679 --> 01:11:34,725
When I was your age,
I was the only woman

999
01:11:34,768 --> 01:11:36,901
in a room full of men.

1000
01:11:36,944 --> 01:11:38,032
But you had a job.

1001
01:11:38,076 --> 01:11:39,077
Okay. You know.

1002
01:11:39,120 --> 01:11:40,034
You were getting
paid. Am I wrong?

1003
01:11:40,078 --> 01:11:40,948
I don't have the time for this.

1004
01:11:40,992 --> 01:11:42,099
Clearly you're a bit spoiled.

1005
01:11:42,123 --> 01:11:42,907
Spoiled.

1006
01:11:42,950 --> 01:11:43,821
Let me be frank with you.

1007
01:11:43,864 --> 01:11:45,388
You don't belong here

1008
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:47,346
because you think everyone
is out to get you.

1009
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:49,305
None of us are out to
get you, especially me.

1010
01:11:49,348 --> 01:11:50,586
Oh, Jesus Christ.
I'm trying to help you.

1011
01:11:50,610 --> 01:11:52,699
This was a fantastic,
Liz. Thanks very much.

1012
01:11:52,743 --> 01:11:54,353
Thank you. No more
talking, just leave.

1013
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:55,591
Thank you so much for coming in.

1014
01:11:55,615 --> 01:11:56,486
Hey, if you want to
tell me what to do,

1015
01:11:56,529 --> 01:11:57,269
put me on the fucking payroll.

1016
01:11:57,313 --> 01:11:58,531
How about that?

1017
01:12:15,113 --> 01:12:16,462
Sorry I'm late.

1018
01:12:16,506 --> 01:12:17,898
You okay?

1019
01:12:17,942 --> 01:12:19,160
Yeah.

1020
01:12:19,204 --> 01:12:19,987
You sure.

1021
01:12:20,031 --> 01:12:21,031
Yeah.

1022
01:12:21,772 --> 01:12:23,164
Are we good?

1023
01:12:23,208 --> 01:12:24,208
Yeah. We're good.

1024
01:12:25,993 --> 01:12:28,561
Okay, good. Trucks
coming in 15 minutes.

1025
01:13:32,277 --> 01:13:36,499
Youcef Had dad. H-A-D-D-A-D.

1026
01:13:36,542 --> 01:13:37,369
Address?

1027
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,415
1087 Van Nuys Boulevard.

1028
01:13:39,458 --> 01:13:41,547
Can you tell me if there's
been any activity on my

1029
01:13:41,591 --> 01:13:45,116
business account in the
last 48 hours, please?

1030
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:46,247
Is this a shared account?

1031
01:13:46,291 --> 01:13:48,424
Yes, it's the shared
account. Khalil.

1032
01:13:52,993 --> 01:13:53,993
He did? Okay.

1033
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:58,172
No, I don't need to.

1034
01:14:02,525 --> 01:14:03,525
Thank you.

1035
01:14:10,794 --> 01:14:12,926
He robbed me before
I could rob him.

1036
01:14:16,190 --> 01:14:17,627
You should go.

1037
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:18,670
Hey.

1038
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:23,937
It's going to be okay.

1039
01:14:23,981 --> 01:14:25,373
Twice in one week.

1040
01:14:26,984 --> 01:14:29,508
You hit the same store
twice in one week

1041
01:14:29,552 --> 01:14:30,901
even after I told you the rules?

1042
01:14:30,944 --> 01:14:32,337
Oh, so this is my fault??

1043
01:14:33,512 --> 01:14:34,837
He was going to do
this to you all along.

1044
01:14:34,861 --> 01:14:35,732
I don't know about that.

1045
01:14:35,775 --> 01:14:36,733
I do know. I don't know.

1046
01:14:36,776 --> 01:14:38,735
Yeah, you put up with his shit.

1047
01:14:38,778 --> 01:14:40,016
You didn't fight
back soon enough

1048
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,365
and you let him take
advantage of you, okay?

1049
01:14:41,389 --> 01:14:42,410
Who's fucking fault is that?

1050
01:14:42,434 --> 01:14:45,176
Hey! Hey, did you fucking hear?

1051
01:14:45,219 --> 01:14:48,353
Did you hear? I just
lost everything!

1052
01:14:48,396 --> 01:14:52,009
I am have nothing! Two
years of fucking work!

1053
01:14:53,706 --> 01:14:54,925
Yeah. Okay.

1054
01:14:54,968 --> 01:14:56,163
Come on, please. Get
the fuck out, please!

1055
01:14:56,187 --> 01:14:59,582
Hey, careful! Nice.

1056
01:15:09,592 --> 01:15:10,592
Where is he?

1057
01:15:14,422 --> 01:15:18,775
Santa Clarita with the
Armenians, Robert and.

1058
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:19,906
Yeah? Mm hmm.

1059
01:15:20,820 --> 01:15:24,955
Is he there right now?
Let's go talk to him.

1060
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:29,089
It's a different situation
now. I need to think.

1061
01:15:29,133 --> 01:15:31,744
Is it? Explain it.

1062
01:15:31,788 --> 01:15:35,748
He's not alone and these
are very serious people.

1063
01:15:35,792 --> 01:15:36,923
No, no.

1064
01:15:39,709 --> 01:15:41,972
We're serious people. Okay?

1065
01:15:43,190 --> 01:15:44,888
He should be scared of us.

1066
01:15:45,932 --> 01:15:47,649
Motherfuckers will just
keep taking from you

1067
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:48,718
and taking from you until

1068
01:15:48,761 --> 01:15:50,415
you make the God
damn rules yourself.

1069
01:15:50,458 --> 01:15:52,504
That's what this is about.

1070
01:15:52,548 --> 01:15:55,115
Am I wrong? Am I wrong?

1071
01:15:57,988 --> 01:16:01,992
Now, you told me I was going
to get a cut and I want my cut.

1072
01:16:03,297 --> 01:16:04,951
So let's go right now.

1073
01:16:04,995 --> 01:16:05,822
Right now?

1074
01:16:05,865 --> 01:16:07,606
He thinks you're a pushover.

1075
01:16:07,650 --> 01:16:10,609
He's not expecting you to fight
back. That's an opportunity.

1076
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:16,572
You're a very bad influence.

1077
01:16:23,448 --> 01:16:27,104
What's up? You're
working on your day off?

1078
01:17:50,840 --> 01:17:55,192
What was it for, your
assault conviction?

1079
01:17:58,238 --> 01:18:02,112
It was just a guy I was dating
and we fought all the time.

1080
01:18:06,203 --> 01:18:07,204
One day, I just,

1081
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:11,904
you know what my mistake
really was though?

1082
01:18:13,384 --> 01:18:14,559
I didn't go far enough.

1083
01:18:16,474 --> 01:18:17,736
I didn't really scare him.

1084
01:18:19,782 --> 01:18:20,870
You know, 'cause if I had,

1085
01:18:20,913 --> 01:18:22,313
he would've never
called the police.

1086
01:18:28,181 --> 01:18:29,443
Don't follow me to close.

1087
01:18:59,909 --> 01:19:01,301
Hi, how's it going? Khalil?

1088
01:19:02,346 --> 01:19:03,564
What is this?

1089
01:19:03,608 --> 01:19:06,350
I got a order, food
order for Khalil Had dad.

1090
01:19:06,393 --> 01:19:07,612
Is this the right place?

1091
01:19:08,744 --> 01:19:11,094
All right. Just pass it through.

1092
01:19:11,137 --> 01:19:12,158
Yeah. I don't think
it's going to fit.

1093
01:19:12,182 --> 01:19:13,966
It's a big order. Let's see.

1094
01:19:14,010 --> 01:19:15,011
Let me check it out.

1095
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:17,337
Do you want me to
just bring it inside?

1096
01:19:17,361 --> 01:19:18,623
No. No. Just.

1097
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,713
Look, I got to go. Okay,
I got another order.

1098
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:22,540
Okay. Hold on.

1099
01:19:22,583 --> 01:19:23,583
All right.

1100
01:19:35,814 --> 01:19:37,076
Ah, What are you doing?

1101
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:39,818
Hey, shut the fuck up
or I'll zap you again.

1102
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:41,472
No, no, no. Shut up.

1103
01:19:41,515 --> 01:19:42,429
How many people are inside?

1104
01:19:42,473 --> 01:19:43,866
I don't know? How many people?

1105
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:44,692
I don't know, all right.
How many people?

1106
01:19:44,736 --> 01:19:45,955
Six or seven! I don't know!

1107
01:19:45,998 --> 01:19:46,825
Where's Khalil?

1108
01:19:46,869 --> 01:19:48,261
In his room. I don't know.

1109
01:19:48,305 --> 01:19:49,132
I don't know what's going
on. I don't know anything.

1110
01:19:49,175 --> 01:19:50,698
Unlock the phone. Go ahead.

1111
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:55,791
Okay. Just let me go, please.

1112
01:19:55,834 --> 01:19:57,227
All right, chill out. All right?

1113
01:19:57,270 --> 01:19:58,857
We're just going to park
your car down the street.

1114
01:19:58,881 --> 01:20:00,293
All right, you shouldn't have
been here. It's your fault.

1115
01:20:00,317 --> 01:20:01,318
Wait! No, no, no!

1116
01:21:20,223 --> 01:21:22,355
You already know. Come on, man.

1117
01:21:22,399 --> 01:21:24,792
Let's go. Don't forget the keys.

1118
01:22:13,537 --> 01:22:15,191
He's not in there.

1119
01:22:28,465 --> 01:22:29,988
Wait! Wait!

1120
01:22:35,689 --> 01:22:37,430
What are you doing?

1121
01:23:16,948 --> 01:23:18,317
Okay, now you're
going to do what I say

1122
01:23:18,341 --> 01:23:20,386
or I'm gonna slit
your fucking throat.

1123
01:23:20,430 --> 01:23:21,692
Do you understand?

1124
01:23:21,735 --> 01:23:22,799
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1125
01:23:22,823 --> 01:23:24,149
You took his money.
Where is it at?

1126
01:23:24,173 --> 01:23:25,324
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1127
01:23:25,348 --> 01:23:27,785
Where is it at? Tell
me where it's at!

1128
01:23:27,828 --> 01:23:29,047
There's no money here.

1129
01:23:29,091 --> 01:23:30,677
What do you think, I
withdrew all that cash?

1130
01:23:30,701 --> 01:23:32,181
You can't do that!

1131
01:23:33,182 --> 01:23:36,141
Please, I'm going
to bleed to death.

1132
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:39,381
Tell me where it's at
and I'll let you go.

1133
01:23:39,405 --> 01:23:42,060
There's nothing here! Go look!

1134
01:23:42,104 --> 01:23:43,104
You're crazy!

1135
01:23:50,199 --> 01:23:53,680
No, no, no, no, no.

1136
01:23:53,724 --> 01:23:55,682
I think you're lying, okay?

1137
01:23:55,726 --> 01:23:57,075
I'm going to count to three

1138
01:23:57,119 --> 01:23:59,556
and then I'm going
to slit your throat.

1139
01:23:59,599 --> 01:24:00,600
One.

1140
01:24:00,644 --> 01:24:02,385
There's really
nothing here. Okay?

1141
01:24:02,428 --> 01:24:03,212
Two!

1142
01:24:03,255 --> 01:24:04,648
There's no money here!

1143
01:24:04,691 --> 01:24:06,041
Three!

1144
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:10,480
Okay, in the fridge.
There's cash in the fridge.

1145
01:24:38,943 --> 01:24:41,119
Can you breathe? Can you talk?

1146
01:24:43,643 --> 01:24:45,036
Call an ambulance.

1147
01:24:46,168 --> 01:24:47,995
I got you. Good, good.

1148
01:24:49,823 --> 01:24:51,216
You're all right.

1149
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,130
Okay. Okay.

1150
01:25:05,143 --> 01:25:07,711
All right, where are your keys?

1151
01:25:08,842 --> 01:25:09,887
Give me your keys.

1152
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:10,714
What?

1153
01:25:10,757 --> 01:25:11,757
I need your keys.

1154
01:25:13,456 --> 01:25:15,849
I need a doctor.

1155
01:25:15,893 --> 01:25:17,088
I know, I'm going
to get you a doctor

1156
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:19,592
but I need your fucking
keys, all right?

1157
01:25:19,636 --> 01:25:22,334
What happened to him?
Did you kill him?

1158
01:25:22,378 --> 01:25:23,901
No.

1159
01:25:23,944 --> 01:25:25,468
Hey, stay awake. Okay?

1160
01:25:25,511 --> 01:25:26,662
I'm going to get
you to a hospital,

1161
01:25:26,686 --> 01:25:29,385
but I need your fucking
keys, all right?

1162
01:25:29,428 --> 01:25:32,997
What did we do? What happened?

1163
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,869
Fuck.

1164
01:25:42,789 --> 01:25:43,789
Fuck! Shit!

1165
01:26:07,249 --> 01:26:12,254
I'm sorry.

1166
01:28:01,406 --> 01:28:05,584
Here, right?

1167
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:16,159
Searching!

1168
01:28:16,943 --> 01:28:19,859
Go, go, go, go. LAPD!

1169
01:28:19,903 --> 01:28:20,903
Clear.

1170
01:28:24,037 --> 01:28:25,517
Clear.

1171
01:28:27,650 --> 01:28:28,650
Got them?

1172
01:28:30,435 --> 01:28:31,784
Clear that room.

1173
01:28:34,178 --> 01:28:35,178
Clear.
