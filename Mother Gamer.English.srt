1
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,083
May I have your attention.

2
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:57,541
Parents of new elementary students,

3
00:00:57,625 --> 00:01:01,666
please submit your documents
at the assembly hall

4
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,041
no later than 11 a.m.

5
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,750
Move, everyone.

6
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,750
Let me through.

7
00:01:46,958 --> 00:01:49,000
This way, son.

8
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:53,750
Oh, my god.

9
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,791
Come here.

10
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,291
Isares Arunvilai is number one
on the waiting list.

11
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,041
He's got 97 out of 100.

12
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:09,625
How much did the accepted students score?

13
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:11,375
Between 98 to 100.

14
00:02:11,458 --> 00:02:13,333
-May I see their names?
-No, you may not.

15
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,291
Thank you.

16
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:16,250
So he's giving up his seat?

17
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:18,750
No. I'm going to speak to the director.

18
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,125
To hold his seat, you have to register

19
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:22,958
and pay the administration fee.

20
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:25,458
But you said he's on the waiting list.

21
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,416
Four students
who scored 96.5 are also waiting.

22
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,375
All right. How much?

23
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,583
A total of 9,800 baht.

24
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:02,375
Ohm.

25
00:03:03,541 --> 00:03:07,500
If we have 25,000 baht
and we pay 600 for the registration fee,

26
00:03:07,583 --> 00:03:08,708
how much do we have left?

27
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:10,625
It's 24,400 baht.

28
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:15,666
And if we pay an extra 9,800 baht fee
to hold a place on the waiting list,

29
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,750
how much do we have left?

30
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,916
We'll only have 14,600 baht.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,083
Also we need new uniforms,
new shoes, and a new school bag.

32
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:24,041
Mom.

33
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:27,708
I can't believe
you only got on the waiting list.

34
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,916
Just one more point,
why couldn't you do it for me?

35
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:34,500
Try harder next time, okay?

36
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,083
I will, Mom.

37
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:50,166
Ohm, come with me.

38
00:04:07,875 --> 00:04:10,666
Just one game, then study hard.
Don't let me down.

39
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:44,833
8 YEARS LATER

40
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:54,250
FEBRUARY 8

41
00:04:54,333 --> 00:05:00,708
OHM'S SCHOLARSHIP EXAM

42
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:08,583
"Today, students spend an average

43
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,375
of five hours a day in their classroom."

44
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,333
"Statistics also show that they spend

45
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:16,375
4.1 hours a day looking at their phones."

46
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,625
"The number is likely to go up."

47
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:23,541
"They prefer looking at their phones
to playing sports."

48
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:28,125
"So I'd like to propose a project called
'School…'"

49
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:31,708
No, scratch that. "Phone-Free Classroom."

50
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:38,750
"We must now realize
that mobile phones are a major threat."

51
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,333
Hello?

52
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,750
Ms. Ben? My son won't need
your tutoring services this month.

53
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,583
His friend took an online class
and got good grades.

54
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,166
So my son wants to give it a try.

55
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,250
That's okay. Bye.

56
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,708
TUTORING INCOME -4,000 BAHT

WATER BILL -400 BAHT

61
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:36,583
Your friend SonicFighter is back again.

62
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:38,041
Hello, everyone.

63
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:51,666
Triple Kill, I got you! That's it, boy!

64
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,916
Here it is, attack now!

65
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,041
Nice one!

66
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:05,125
Tank? Take this!

67
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,375
Arum, go! Go now!

68
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,833
Easy, I'll go round.

69
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,375
Yorn with low mobility! It's over!

70
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:27,000
Shit!

71
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,708
Why didn't you open the door?

72
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:35,000
Sorry, Mom.

73
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,750
I'm writing a speech.

74
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,166
What speech?

75
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,458
My speech for Mother's Day.

76
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:43,625
I was selected to read it on stage.

77
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,583
What's with the earphones?

78
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:49,041
Well, when I need to focus,

79
00:07:49,125 --> 00:07:50,875
I always listen to music.

80
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,083
Well.

81
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,125
New computer set?

82
00:07:59,708 --> 00:08:01,541
Yes, Mom.

83
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:02,916
It was Palm's.

84
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:05,166
I sold my old PC

85
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,666
and used the money
to buy this one from him.

86
00:08:08,458 --> 00:08:11,750
Don't worry. It's a cheap outdated model.

87
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:15,750
And this?

88
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,916
What is it?

89
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:25,416
It's a letter

90
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,500
asking for your permission to let me
enter a game tournament.

91
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,375
Where will you find time for that?

92
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,625
You have to focus on your studies.

93
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,833
I have some free time
when I'm not studying.

94
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:44,875
Look, I'm always on track, right?

95
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,750
It's just an online game.

96
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,458
Please sign it.

97
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:52,083
Have I ever let you down?

98
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:03,625
NEXT MORNING

99
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:10,083
INVITATION TO JOIN
MOTHER'S DAY ACTIVITIES

100
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:19,041
PERMISSION TO PARTICIPATE
IN ROV TOURNAMENT

101
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:57,041
Director, we must realize that
mobile phones are a major threat.

102
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,750
The Wi-Fi here is very strong.

103
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:08,625
That means if our school's Wi-Fi
is this strong,

104
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,250
mobile phones must be
unequivocally banned in class.

105
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,166
Sir, she's right.

106
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,125
Schools in France have already
implemented this rule.

107
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,750
I will push it through.

108
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:22,125
Our school should've been stricter
in this regard a long time ago.

109
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,583
I'll send the two of you to other schools

110
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,916
to study how they restrict
mobile phone usage.

111
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,291
That way,
you can adapt it to our classrooms.

112
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:33,250
From now on, our Ratpanyavittayakom School

113
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,333
will become a model of excellence!

114
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:49,500
All right, the Burmese attacked us
from three separate fronts.

115
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,750
From the North,
in the town of Chiang Saen.

116
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:56,625
From the West, here.

117
00:10:56,708 --> 00:10:59,250
Through the Three Pagodas Pass.

118
00:10:59,333 --> 00:11:02,125
And from the South, at Ratchaburi.

119
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,333
King…

120
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,791
Hold on.

121
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,000
Right.

122
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:16,083
King Bodawpaya split his last troops
into nine armies

123
00:11:16,166 --> 00:11:18,916
and marched them toward Bangkok.

124
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:24,916
King Rama I sent his three armies
to halt the Burmese.

125
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:29,250
But in a war, numbers aren't everything.

126
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,625
What you need is a strategy!

127
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:35,166
Holy crap! Just like playing RoV!

128
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,791
Class, what's the name
of the Burmese general?

129
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,791
Another great battle is here.

130
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,708
We're entering a new war!

131
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,416
The Army of Valor

132
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:00,458
marching into the jungle battlefield.

133
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,708
The troop is split into three fronts.

134
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,833
The five heroes must work together

135
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,500
and marshal their forces into the fray.

136
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:25,041
Their mission

137
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:28,625
is to reach the enemy's Core.

138
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:34,250
They have to rely on a combination
of skills and talents

139
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:37,333
to fight their opponents
in this breathless battle.

140
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,208
But in war, there must be sacrifices.

141
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,583
But that doesn't mean defeat.

142
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,166
The only way to win is
to destroy the towers!

143
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,625
For the glory of…

144
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,250
RoV.

145
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,250
Come and get me!

146
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,666
See? Who's the boss now?

147
00:13:31,291 --> 00:13:32,708
I just saved you.

148
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:33,958
All of you!

149
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:37,541
March your asses to the Discipline Office!

150
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:38,666
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

151
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:45,416

153
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,833
Kobsak,

154
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:58,291
I haven't tallied your latest offense.

155
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,250
But this is already your ninth.

156
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:04,166
One more time and you'll be kicked out.

157
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:07,708
How many times have I told you
to behave yourself?

158
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,333
Why can't you be like other students?

159
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,750
All you do is cause trouble
and play stupid games.

160
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:13,375
You will have no future!

161
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:14,500
All you do is cause…

162
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,916
You will have no future!

163
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:16,958
All you do is cause…

164
00:14:17,041 --> 00:14:18,416
You will have no future!

00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:27,916
Kobsak!

167
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,125
Where are you going?

168
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,333
Haven't you listened to anything
I've said?

169
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:34,416
That's a game-addicted teen for you.

170
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,250
Aggressive.

171
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:52,375
MOTHER'S DAY

172
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,041
PADUNGKIAT PATTANA SCHOOL

173
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,333
ISARES ARUNVILAI
STUDENT OF THE YEAR

174
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,500
Did you watch Ohm's gamecast
the other day?

175
00:16:11,583 --> 00:16:12,833
RoV?

176
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:13,958
Yes, I did.

177
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:16,708
He was on a roll
when his mom suddenly walked in.

178
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:18,916
He lied to her without skipping a beat.

179
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,125
Son of the year.

180
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,375
His channel is "SonicFighter," right?

181
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,166
It was fucking hilarious.

182
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,333
Totally.

183
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,875
Yes, nice one!

184
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,375
You rock, Champ.

185
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:58,333
Super awesome.

186
00:16:58,416 --> 00:16:59,375
Shit!

187
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:02,916
Mom.

188
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:07,500
Why are you doing this?

189
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:12,375
Did your game addiction
make you lie to me?

190
00:17:13,625 --> 00:17:16,291
I never taught you to be a liar.

191
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,666
From now on, I'll limit your phone use.

192
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,458
-Mom.
-Not another word.

193
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,708
Quit playing

194
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:26,916
and resign from Higher.

195
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:34,791
Next, Isares Arunvilai,

196
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:38,666
Student of the Year 2019,

197
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,375
will represent the class
by giving a speech.

198
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,541
MOTHER'S DAY

199
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:51,833
Isares, please come up on stage.

200
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,708
Isares, please come up now.

201
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:18,583
Ohm!

202
00:18:19,083 --> 00:18:20,625
Come down, Ohm.

203
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,666
Ohm.

204
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:38,375
Mom, is Ohm there with you?

205
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,500
Nothing.

206
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,583
Hi, my name's Best.

207
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,583
I'm the one who called you.

208
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:02,791
Ohm.

209
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,625
Come home with me.

210
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:07,500
You're not competing.

211
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,666
He could go home.

212
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:13,333
But if you want him to quit the team,

213
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,875
you're obliged by contract
to pay compensation.

214
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:20,583
The equivalent of his 12 months' pay
plus allowance.

215
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,083
What allowances?

216
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:29,916
Do you really think giving your kid
100 baht a day is enough?

217
00:19:31,791 --> 00:19:34,791
Ohm earns several thousand
a month by himself.

218
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:38,166
You really have no idea?

219
00:19:41,625 --> 00:19:45,875
The compensation will be 675,000 baht.

220
00:19:50,541 --> 00:19:52,083
Wait a minute.

221
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,250
What for? Why do I have to pay for it?

222
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:56,791
Because you signed the contract.

223
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,250
I didn't sign any contract.

224
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:04,500
To terminate the contract,
you must pay for the damages.

225
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,333
My team has a sponsor.

226
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:10,458
You can't ruin my team
and get away with it.

227
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,083
What is this, Ohm?

228
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:16,250
Come home with me now.

229
00:20:16,333 --> 00:20:18,333
Yes, go home and talk it over.

230
00:20:18,416 --> 00:20:20,625
But while Ohm is still under contract,

231
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:23,666
he must come and train with the team.

232
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,333
We will compete in the national league

233
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,083
to represent Thailand
in a world tournament in Korea.

234
00:20:29,791 --> 00:20:31,541
On February 8.

235
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,708
I ask for your understanding.

236
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,541
Don't ruin the hard work
all of us have put in.

237
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,250
FEBRUARY 8: OHM'S SCHOLARSHIP EXAM

238
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:47,458
Ohm.

239
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:50,041
How long have you been playing?

240
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,708
It doesn't affect my grades, does it?

241
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:58,208
Answer me, how long have you been playing?

242
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:01,166
Why do you care more
about money than about your future?

243
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,375
How much can you make by playing games?

244
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:06,541
More than you. I don't even have to
rely on you for money now.

245
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:08,708
See? Games make you aggressive.

246
00:21:09,541 --> 00:21:11,208
You can make your own money, huh?

247
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,750
Student of the Year?

248
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:15,791
You forged my signature.

249
00:21:29,958 --> 00:21:31,500
I did ask you to sign it.

250
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:35,291
But you kept saying

251
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,958
whatever you wanted to say.

252
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:48,083
Really, have you ever listened to me?

253
00:22:19,125 --> 00:22:20,833
FEBRUARY 8: OHM'S SCHOLARSHIP EXAM

254
00:22:20,916 --> 00:22:23,833
I'LL TALK TO YOU
ONLY AFTER THE TOURNAMENT

255
00:22:33,541 --> 00:22:35,583
Ohm, have your breakfast.

256
00:22:38,291 --> 00:22:39,166
Ohm.

257
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:46,125
I'LL TALK TO YOU
ONLY AFTER THE TOURNAMENT

258
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:51,791
But if you want him to quit the team,

259
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:56,000
you're obliged to pay 675,000 baht
for the damages.

260
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,500
I've got all the documents
for the refinance of your home.

261
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,083
Your property is in a prime location.

262
00:24:01,166 --> 00:24:02,583
You've had it for three years.

263
00:24:02,666 --> 00:24:05,166
The value must have risen.

264
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,833
Don't worry.

265
00:24:06,916 --> 00:24:11,458
I'll speed up the process
and get back to you.

266
00:24:25,791 --> 00:24:28,166
We will compete in the national league

267
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,916
to represent Thailand
in a world tournament in Korea.

268
00:24:34,166 --> 00:24:36,125
We will compete in the national league

269
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:38,833
to represent Thailand
in a world tournament in Korea.

270
00:24:40,625 --> 00:24:44,666
If they lose, then they won't get to go.

271
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:57,125
OHM, WILL TAKE HIGHER
EVEN HIGHER THAN BEFORE

272
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,625
WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP
FOR THE SECOND TIME

273
00:25:14,208 --> 00:25:17,375
KOBSAK, MAPRANG, GUIDE
GOT KICKED OUT

274
00:25:32,458 --> 00:25:33,875
Kobsak.

275
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:40,500
What's up, ma'am?

276
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:46,625
You know Higher Ground Thailand, right?

277
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:52,500
You were on this team before.

278
00:25:53,458 --> 00:25:55,083
Why do you ask?

279
00:25:55,166 --> 00:25:57,666
I'm starting an E-Sports club.

280
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:02,958
Sorry, ma'am,

281
00:26:04,875 --> 00:26:06,833
what have you been smoking?

282
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:12,708
This Higher… Are they really that good?

283
00:26:14,916 --> 00:26:17,583
Their new gen is not bad.

284
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:22,625
But the original members
were a whole lot better.

285
00:26:26,958 --> 00:26:30,333
Then start a team and beat them.
I'll be your manager.

286
00:26:31,875 --> 00:26:33,625
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

287
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:39,583
Are you kidding me?
I already struggle in school as it is.

288
00:26:40,208 --> 00:26:42,125
I don't have time for anything else.

289
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:50,208
If you win the national tournament,

290
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:52,750
I'll help you graduate.

291
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:13,458
How about this?

292
00:27:14,166 --> 00:27:16,083
You know the RoV website, right?

293
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,916
There's an application form
for the tournament there.

294
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,583
I'll send you all the members' IDs.

295
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:26,125
But one more thing,

296
00:27:26,833 --> 00:27:28,583
I get to choose the players myself.

297
00:27:28,666 --> 00:27:30,916
But I have to know
their backgrounds, okay?

298
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:35,666
I heard you had a fight
with one of your teammates.

299
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:37,083
No!

300
00:27:39,708 --> 00:27:42,250
Ms. Ben, chill.

301
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:45,833
I'm not a thug.

302
00:27:54,583 --> 00:27:57,750
Now we are with Gold Cobra.

303
00:27:57,833 --> 00:27:59,625
They are our new champions!

304
00:27:59,708 --> 00:28:02,666
How do you feel?

305
00:28:08,291 --> 00:28:09,250
What's up, Kob?

306
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,666
Guide, do you want to join my team?

307
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,250
Hell yes!

308
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:20,291
"Hell yes!" That's how a champion feels!

309
00:28:35,833 --> 00:28:39,791
SO WHAT SHOULD WE CALL OUR TEAM?

310
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,625
I'LL TALK TO YOU
ONLY AFTER THE TOURNAMENT

311
00:28:58,791 --> 00:29:01,041
FEBRUARY 8: OHM'S SCHOLARSHIP EXAM

312
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:29,083
First, I play the jungler.

313
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:32,791
My position is vital to the team
because it decides victory or defeat.

314
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:37,041
Without me, the first-gen Higher
wouldn't have made it.

315
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:40,916
Even now, people still call me
"The Living Legend."

316
00:29:43,041 --> 00:29:45,666
This is my buddy, Guide.

317
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,833
He's so versatile
that he can play any role.

318
00:29:47,916 --> 00:29:51,916
But when he's the marksman,
prepare to beg for your life.

319
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,291
Once, he was so off his game
that Best kicked him out.

320
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:58,500
But now I'm ready to announce
that he's back in top form.

321
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,416
This is Bank.

322
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,916
A famous gamecaster
with a million subscribers.

323
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,541
His family is loaded.

324
00:30:05,625 --> 00:30:07,125
He's our team's sponsor.

325
00:30:07,208 --> 00:30:10,750
Not a pro player,
but he's a brilliant mid laner.

326
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,166
He can save your ass anywhere in the game.

327
00:30:14,125 --> 00:30:17,458
This is Maprang,
the former girl idol of Higher.

328
00:30:17,541 --> 00:30:20,083
Although Best used to
keep her as a bench-warmer,

329
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,750
don't underestimate her baby-doll looks.

330
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:25,083
She's quick and sharp.
A perfect roaming hero

331
00:30:25,166 --> 00:30:26,500
who keeps an eye on what happens

332
00:30:26,583 --> 00:30:30,000
to cause trouble for the enemies
and to support the team all at once.

333
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:34,833
That's our team.

334
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:38,625
Why only four?

335
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:48,291
Meet Max.

336
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:51,041
Get the fuck off.

337
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,250
Get off, you dickhead.

338
00:30:53,916 --> 00:30:55,125
Sure, dickbag.

339
00:30:57,166 --> 00:30:59,041
This little shit is Max.

340
00:30:59,125 --> 00:31:00,375
He's my neighbor.

341
00:31:00,458 --> 00:31:03,083
He may not look like it,
but he's actually around my age.

342
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:04,750
Max plays the solo fighter.

343
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:05,916
Crafty and fierce.

344
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,458
The only shortcoming is his potty mouth.

345
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,791
Motherfucker.
I'll smack your head right here.

346
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:12,916
Bitch.

347
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,916
I'm Ms. Ben, your team manager.

348
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:21,875
A sub.

349
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,250
The rule doesn't require a team manager.

350
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:33,125
Besides the main players,
one sub is allowed,

351
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:36,625
but he or she must meet
a minimum skill level.

352
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:38,875
A rookie like you won't cut it.

353
00:31:39,708 --> 00:31:43,041
Just give me your ID,
I'll handle the rest.

354
00:31:59,833 --> 00:32:02,541
The Core must be destroyed
in three minutes!

355
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:06,416
Hi guys, Winsy Mavin's here to welcome you

356
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:10,625
to Road to Arena of Valor 2019.

357
00:32:10,708 --> 00:32:12,625
The match
I'm doing a commentary on is between

358
00:32:12,708 --> 00:32:14,708
Ohmgaga and Beta Blue.

359
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:17,041
Our main talking point is that Ohmgaga

360
00:32:17,125 --> 00:32:19,791
has three players
who used to play for Higher.

361
00:32:19,875 --> 00:32:22,375
They are Maprang, Kobsak,

362
00:32:22,458 --> 00:32:25,541
and Guide, a veteran marksman
who's making a comeback.

363
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:29,958
Let's see if this match will really
be settled in three minutes.

364
00:32:30,041 --> 00:32:33,291
I'm looking forward to
an exciting game ahead!

365
00:32:33,375 --> 00:32:36,125
Breach their defense
with Five Sisters Matrix.

366
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:40,291
This complex maneuver by Ohmgaga

367
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,458
relies on a tight interplay
between Kobsak and Guide.

368
00:32:42,541 --> 00:32:45,333
They've unleashed non-stop kills
from the first five seconds.

369
00:32:45,416 --> 00:32:46,625
-Awesome!
-Awesome!

370
00:32:46,708 --> 00:32:48,250
Sweet dreams.

371
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,958
What now, daddy?

372
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:52,458
Next, we'll go for Tier-1 Tower.

373
00:32:52,541 --> 00:32:54,250
Let's do Looking for Trouble, okay?

374
00:32:54,333 --> 00:32:57,416
-Who will do it?
-Not me, I'm pretty.

375
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,125
I'm ready to sacrifice
for the public good.

376
00:33:04,541 --> 00:33:07,541
For freedom.
I'll return happiness to the people!

377
00:33:08,541 --> 00:33:10,666
-Fuck-a-doodle-doo!
-Fuck-a-doodle-doo!

378
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,708
"Looking for Trouble" is a plan

379
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:15,875
in which Bank sacrifices himself as bait

380
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:18,291
to clear the path for his friends
to destroy the first tower.

381
00:33:18,375 --> 00:33:20,291
How generous!

382
00:33:20,375 --> 00:33:22,500
Without sacrifices,
there will be no victory.

383
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,875
No pain, no gain, right?

384
00:33:27,208 --> 00:33:30,291
Tier-2 Tower, Girls Just Want to Have Fun.

385
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:33,125
This plan relies on a gang of "girls."

386
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:34,833
Kobsak plays the seducer.

387
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:36,750
His role is to lure the enemies in

388
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,791
so the other "girls" waiting in the back, 

389
00:33:38,875 --> 00:33:40,291
Maprang, Guide, and Max,

390
00:33:40,375 --> 00:33:42,250
can sneak an attack on them.

391
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:43,333
Amazing!

392
00:33:43,416 --> 00:33:44,500
Smooth and swift!

393
00:33:44,958 --> 00:33:46,500
That's it!

394
00:33:46,583 --> 00:33:48,625
Let's end this!

395
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:53,875
Or they'll hit our towers.

396
00:33:54,625 --> 00:33:56,375
When they're born, we'll kill them.

397
00:33:56,625 --> 00:33:57,875
What a savage little guy!

398
00:33:57,958 --> 00:33:59,333
-Always going for a kill.
-Yes!

399
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,833
-Come on! Let's kill them all!
-Come on.

400
00:34:01,916 --> 00:34:04,250
Three minutes are almost over.

401
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,458
Ohmgaga is raiding the Core
with a huge advantage.

402
00:34:07,541 --> 00:34:09,166
They're also ruthless and sadistic!

403
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,041
They're waiting to kill newborns
in the tower!

404
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:13,166
Man, what a bunch of cutthroats!

405
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,291
-That's it!
-Let's do it!

406
00:34:17,708 --> 00:34:20,750
Beta Blue's Core has been destroyed!

407
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,291
It has now been reduced to ruins!

408
00:34:22,375 --> 00:34:24,666
Ohmgaga is through to the next round.

409
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:29,666
I've never witnessed a game
as exciting as this in my life!

410
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:36,625
See, my plan always works.

411
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,041
Awesome!

412
00:34:41,208 --> 00:34:42,416
Are you that hungry?

413
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Seriously?

414
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:45,333
Look at him.

415
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,625
Hungry online and offline.

416
00:34:51,166 --> 00:34:53,083
ORIGINAL MEMBERS RISE AGAIN AS OHMGAGA

417
00:34:53,625 --> 00:34:56,666
FOUR STRAIGHT WINS
AMONG THE LAST 128 TEAMS

418
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:03,625
OHMGAGA DECLARES WAR ON HIGHER

419
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:14,166
You guys were phenomenal
in the last four matches,

420
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:16,583
what's your secret?

421
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,208
I've studied the game's meta thoroughly.

422
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:23,208
The secret is to pick the right heroes.

423
00:35:23,291 --> 00:35:25,708
Let me tell you,

424
00:35:25,791 --> 00:35:28,666
Ohmgaga is ready to take on anyone.

425
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,458
PHONE-FREE CLASSROOM PROJECT

426
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:45,541
A one-on-one match with Higher
is coming up.

427
00:35:45,625 --> 00:35:47,583
Do you have any message for your rival?

428
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:51,416
Go to hell, assholes.
Do you want to fight one-on-one with me?

429
00:35:51,958 --> 00:35:53,041
What was that?

430
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,208
With Kob and I on the team,

431
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:00,250
we'll never lose.

432
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,500
-Listen, Maprang.
-Yes?

433
00:36:16,583 --> 00:36:19,250
Thanks for joining my team.

434
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:23,750
I did it because you sounded desperate.

435
00:36:26,083 --> 00:36:30,083
If we win and go to Korea,

436
00:36:31,041 --> 00:36:33,000
will you still go to study in England?

437
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:36,875
Let's wait until we get into
the round of last 16 teams first.

438
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:43,333
-I have something to show you.
-What?

439
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:46,875
My dad just gave it to me.

440
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:50,250
Congratulations!

441
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,291
Now you're a biker like you always wanted.

442
00:36:52,375 --> 00:36:54,083
I'm still missing a biker babe…

443
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:19,458
Stop.

444
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:21,958
Why?

445
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,166
Thanks for the ride.

446
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:50,041
ROUND OF 128 TEAMS

447
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,500
Ms. Ben, are you free?

448
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:55,375
What happened?

449
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:56,666
Shit happens!

450
00:37:56,750 --> 00:37:58,416
Guide has dumped us!

451
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,083
-How come?
-Higher has bought him back.

452
00:38:02,166 --> 00:38:04,208
Because we can't pay him a salary.

453
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:07,291
Goddamnit, he quit just before a match!

454
00:38:08,875 --> 00:38:10,458
Call him now!

455
00:38:11,333 --> 00:38:13,083
He won't come back.

456
00:38:13,166 --> 00:38:15,083
You're our sub.

457
00:38:15,166 --> 00:38:16,541
You have to play.

458
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,250
I can't.

459
00:38:18,333 --> 00:38:19,666
You have to.

460
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:21,625
Game starts in 15 minutes!

461
00:38:42,666 --> 00:38:43,750
MAP INFO: STANDARD MODE

462
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,708
Ms. Ben, you have to play the marksman.

463
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,583
Choose a marksman character, any of them.

464
00:38:49,666 --> 00:38:50,958
And please don't die!

465
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:52,708
The marksman is squishy.

466
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:57,833
Now tell me what to do.

467
00:38:57,916 --> 00:38:59,458
Dumbass.

468
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:01,958
You're Yorn. Go to Dragon Lane.

469
00:39:02,041 --> 00:39:04,333
Who's the teacher here, stupid?

470
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,791
Watch your language, kid!

471
00:39:07,291 --> 00:39:08,791
Don't follow me.

472
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:12,291
Go to Maprang. Go!

473
00:39:12,375 --> 00:39:14,250
Get behind the tower.

474
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,583
Hide!

475
00:39:18,750 --> 00:39:20,416
Just hit the right button.

476
00:39:22,250 --> 00:39:24,083
Don't let anyone get near the tower.

477
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,208
Who's in there?

478
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,750
I need to pee.

479
00:39:36,833 --> 00:39:38,250
Are you on drugs or what?

480
00:39:38,333 --> 00:39:40,041
She's playing like a frigging kid.

481
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:45,708
Who's in there?

482
00:39:45,791 --> 00:39:47,125
I need to shit.

483
00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:56,458
Don't just stand there.

484
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:58,916
Move around.

485
00:40:04,291 --> 00:40:07,250
Please check if there's anyone missing.

486
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:09,625
We've been knocking but there's no answer.

487
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:11,333
Maybe there's been an accident.

488
00:40:11,833 --> 00:40:13,166
Ms. Ben…

489
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:17,833
MS. TOOM IS CALLING

490
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
No answer.

491
00:40:21,291 --> 00:40:22,625
Can we just win it now?

492
00:40:24,125 --> 00:40:25,500
What's the hurry?

493
00:40:25,583 --> 00:40:27,166
Do you need to shit or what?

494
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:29,750
Please stop at a gas station.

495
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:31,041
It's an emergency.

496
00:40:36,583 --> 00:40:39,041
Yes, we won! We won!

497
00:40:44,166 --> 00:40:46,125
Without Guide, we should just quit.

498
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:48,083
We won't be this lucky in the next match.

499
00:40:48,166 --> 00:40:49,333
I'm out.

500
00:40:50,291 --> 00:40:51,375
Come on.

501
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:52,500
Relax.

502
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:55,375
We've made it this far.

503
00:40:55,458 --> 00:40:57,500
We're going to be in deep shit.

504
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:02,583
You guys just have to quit,
but my reputation will be ruined.

505
00:41:02,666 --> 00:41:06,791
We played like rookies,
it was embarrassing.

506
00:41:08,458 --> 00:41:12,333
Ms. Ben, do you really think
you can fill in for Guide?

507
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:14,250
Bank.

508
00:41:14,333 --> 00:41:16,708
She's a rookie.

509
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:18,583
Don't pressure her.

510
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,166
Sorry, ma'am.

511
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,000
I have to speak honestly.

512
00:41:23,875 --> 00:41:26,583
You must try not to be a deadweight.

513
00:41:26,666 --> 00:41:28,500
What do you want me to do?

514
00:41:29,708 --> 00:41:32,208
From now until the finals,

515
00:41:32,291 --> 00:41:34,541
you have to play the game
at least 1,000 times.

516
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:37,375
Impossible, I won't have time for that.

517
00:41:38,208 --> 00:41:40,291
Just play 30 times a day.

518
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:41,833
We'll play with you.

519
00:41:43,041 --> 00:41:46,208
What about the one-on-one challenge
with Higher?

520
00:41:46,833 --> 00:41:50,458
There's nothing to fear
when I'm right here!

521
00:41:51,083 --> 00:41:52,000
Listen up!

522
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,625
Starting tomorrow,

523
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:57,916
we all sleep here
so we can teach the teacher.

524
00:42:02,916 --> 00:42:04,291
People keep asking me

525
00:42:04,375 --> 00:42:08,000
what the best strategy for a marksman is.

526
00:42:08,083 --> 00:42:10,416
The first thing you have to remember is

527
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:14,208
who plays the tank on your team.

528
00:42:14,291 --> 00:42:16,458
Who is Tank? Is it a water tank?

529
00:42:16,541 --> 00:42:18,458
Or maybe "tank you"?

530
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:20,416
No.

531
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:22,541
Tank is the hero with the highest HP.

532
00:42:22,625 --> 00:42:25,333
The toughest, strongest guy
who can protect you,

533
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:28,791
because your body is squishy.

534
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:31,708
Without cover you're dead.

535
00:42:31,791 --> 00:42:34,083
So you have to follow
the tank of your team.

536
00:42:34,166 --> 00:42:35,583
YOU SHOULD EAT HEALTHY FOOD, OHM.

537
00:42:35,666 --> 00:42:37,583
You have to keep in mind

538
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:38,791
who your Tank is.

539
00:42:38,875 --> 00:42:40,125
Or you're finished.

540
00:42:40,208 --> 00:42:43,000
Don't go at it alone,
because you're squishy.

541
00:42:43,083 --> 00:42:45,958
Again, the marksman
always follows the tank.

542
00:42:46,041 --> 00:42:48,125
Never let him out of your sight.

543
00:43:07,583 --> 00:43:08,750
What are you doing?

544
00:43:09,791 --> 00:43:12,125
First, you have to develop your skill 

545
00:43:12,208 --> 00:43:14,333
 Because the enemy will go for a kill 

546
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:17,291
If you're too thick to know the drill 

547
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:20,958
And so clumsy
You'll be trapped and killed 

548
00:43:21,041 --> 00:43:25,166
Boom!
Pack it up and roll down the hill 

549
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:28,083
See, you don't know how to kite.

550
00:43:28,166 --> 00:43:30,291
You have to move when you're under attack.

551
00:43:32,875 --> 00:43:36,125
The marksman must support the tank.

552
00:43:38,958 --> 00:43:41,125
Follow him and watch his steps.

553
00:43:42,875 --> 00:43:43,875
Got it?

554
00:43:48,041 --> 00:43:49,125
Take him.

555
00:43:49,208 --> 00:43:50,208
Take him.

556
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:53,083
Omen, a crafty warrior.

557
00:43:53,166 --> 00:43:56,291
Omen's first skill is hooking the enemies.

558
00:43:56,375 --> 00:43:58,833
The second skill is deflecting the damage.

559
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:02,291
The third skill is imprisoning enemies,
with a 40-second cooldown.

560
00:44:02,375 --> 00:44:04,541
Valhein is a marksman.

561
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:05,541
Got it?

562
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:07,958
You even know how to hit it?

563
00:44:09,333 --> 00:44:10,791
You keep missing!

564
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:12,333
Having fun?

565
00:44:21,083 --> 00:44:22,875
HI, MS. BEN. YOUR LOAN IS APPROVED.

566
00:44:22,958 --> 00:44:25,250
PLEASE COME IN AND SIGN THE AGREEMENT
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

567
00:44:25,333 --> 00:44:28,125
CAN I HAVE A LITTLE MORE TIME
TO THINK ABOUT THIS?

568
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:30,416
Now you attack. I'll show you how to kite.

569
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:32,833
Okay.

570
00:44:32,916 --> 00:44:34,458
No! That's not it!

571
00:44:34,541 --> 00:44:37,083
That's fencing! It's not kiting!

572
00:44:37,166 --> 00:44:39,333
Take that! This is kiting!

573
00:44:40,250 --> 00:44:41,083
Kob!

574
00:44:44,208 --> 00:44:45,208
Take it easy.

575
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:46,333
Does it hurt?

576
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:47,333
Careful.

577
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,458
-You're all bruised up.
-Not so hard.

578
00:44:49,541 --> 00:44:50,791
Yes.

579
00:44:51,541 --> 00:44:54,458
-Kob should've held back.
-That's right.

580
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,208
I told him so.

581
00:44:57,291 --> 00:44:58,458
Ms. Ben,

582
00:44:58,541 --> 00:45:02,416
I told you, no pain, no game.

583
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:07,458
Brush your teeth, Max.

584
00:45:08,708 --> 00:45:09,958
Hey, you.

585
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,000
When was the last time you brushed?

586
00:45:12,083 --> 00:45:13,083
Fuck off.

587
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:16,916
Do you want to fight me?

588
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,041
Sure. Can you reach my face?

589
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:20,958
-What?
-Oh, my!

590
00:45:23,708 --> 00:45:25,291
Four in the mid lane! Attack Dark Slayer!

591
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,958
All of you, come here!

592
00:45:27,041 --> 00:45:28,208
I'm dead!

593
00:45:28,291 --> 00:45:29,166
Ohm!

594
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:30,083
I'm coming.

595
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:31,458
I'm dead.

596
00:45:31,541 --> 00:45:32,875
We can still get it!

597
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,250
I'm dead too, Ohm.

598
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:35,541
Their jungler is dead.

599
00:45:35,625 --> 00:45:36,500
I'm dead too.

600
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:37,708
Ohm, get Dark Slayer!

601
00:45:37,791 --> 00:45:38,625
I'm dead.

602
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:41,333
Ohm, why didn't you come help us?

603
00:45:41,416 --> 00:45:42,416
I can end this myself.

604
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,583
-Why didn't you come when we called?
-I will show you.

605
00:45:44,666 --> 00:45:47,250
-You're the only one left!
-Ohm, what are you doing?

606
00:45:51,083 --> 00:45:52,375
Don't fucking say "yes."

607
00:45:58,666 --> 00:46:00,500
Do you think you're the star player?

608
00:46:02,250 --> 00:46:04,000
If Violet wasn't so lame,

609
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,375
you would've been crushed.

610
00:46:16,041 --> 00:46:18,000
Why did you hide in the bush?

611
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:23,833
Why didn't you come out
and help them get Dark Slayer?

612
00:46:26,541 --> 00:46:28,041
Had you come out sooner,

613
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,958
no one would've gotten killed. Got it?

614
00:46:35,291 --> 00:46:37,291
We could've won more clinically.

615
00:46:39,833 --> 00:46:41,666
You think you're a hotshot?

616
00:46:43,833 --> 00:46:44,750
But…

617
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,333
But what?

618
00:46:48,041 --> 00:46:49,333
I just won.

619
00:46:52,458 --> 00:46:55,208
But you did not win
like a Higher member is supposed to.

620
00:47:02,041 --> 00:47:05,500
Since Guide left, we've played like shit.

621
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:08,625
We're a joke.
Our subscribers have left in droves.

622
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:10,625
Maprang, you have to help us now.

623
00:47:12,958 --> 00:47:15,125
Do I have to do it?

624
00:47:15,208 --> 00:47:18,000
Come on,
just like when you were with Higher.

625
00:47:18,083 --> 00:47:19,750
You did this before.

626
00:47:25,666 --> 00:47:27,666
Hi, today…

627
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:31,708
Best forced me to do it then.

628
00:47:31,791 --> 00:47:33,958
Please, I'm begging you.

629
00:47:34,958 --> 00:47:39,000
Doll yourself up like
you're in a girl group.

630
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:43,125
It will boost our team's rating.

631
00:47:44,458 --> 00:47:46,500
Hi, today is a holiday…

632
00:47:46,583 --> 00:47:50,333
No way. Don't you think I look
more like a boy?

633
00:47:50,416 --> 00:47:51,625
I'm sure you can do it.

634
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:54,208
We have no other options.

635
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:55,916
I'm desperate.

636
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,541
Please help me.

637
00:48:02,625 --> 00:48:04,208
Or should I ask her instead?

638
00:48:05,416 --> 00:48:07,166
Need my help?

639
00:48:08,291 --> 00:48:09,416
-No way.
-No way.

640
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,625
-Go.
-Go!

641
00:48:12,208 --> 00:48:15,583
Maprang, come play with us.

642
00:48:15,666 --> 00:48:17,250
-Nice and smooth.
-Nice and smooth.

643
00:48:17,333 --> 00:48:18,541
Maprang.

644
00:48:30,875 --> 00:48:31,833
One down!

645
00:48:40,541 --> 00:48:42,541
Did you do your makeup without a mirror?

646
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,291
Wow,

647
00:48:52,916 --> 00:48:53,916
cute.

648
00:48:55,083 --> 00:48:56,166
Thanks.

649
00:48:58,791 --> 00:48:59,833
So cute…

650
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,583
because you put duct tape on your brows!

651
00:49:07,958 --> 00:49:09,416
Good one, man!

652
00:49:11,708 --> 00:49:13,833
I'm proud of you.

653
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,500
Our ratings will go through the roof.

654
00:49:19,125 --> 00:49:20,375
I mean it.

655
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,666
You're cute.

656
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:25,750
Cute, my ass.

657
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,375
Best,

658
00:49:48,166 --> 00:49:50,541
I think I'm a better player

659
00:49:51,375 --> 00:49:52,791
when I play in my own style.

660
00:49:52,875 --> 00:49:55,333
Only a good plan can make you win.

661
00:49:56,708 --> 00:50:00,208
Your relentless attacking
has made you famous,

662
00:50:00,833 --> 00:50:05,250
but it's not enough to ensure our victory
in a one-on-one with Kobsak.

663
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:13,791
What will happen if we're over-confident

664
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:16,375
and don't follow the plan?

665
00:50:16,458 --> 00:50:18,083
Ask Guide about it.

666
00:50:22,041 --> 00:50:24,541
If you indulge yourself too much,

667
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:27,041
you'll end up like this team.

668
00:50:32,375 --> 00:50:36,166
This is an example
of a dreadful, ad-lib play.

669
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,625
This is Ohmgaga.

670
00:50:40,541 --> 00:50:44,166
What a shame they have
our old members among them.

671
00:50:47,833 --> 00:50:51,833
Kobsak may be sharp,

672
00:50:52,875 --> 00:50:55,375
but he can't carry the whole team
on his shoulders.

673
00:50:56,833 --> 00:50:58,875
This is Max,

674
00:50:59,416 --> 00:51:02,041
a clusterfuck in the making.

675
00:51:03,583 --> 00:51:07,291
The player True_Heroes
still has a lot to learn.

676
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:15,916
Maprang keeps running around
fixing others' problems.

677
00:51:16,791 --> 00:51:18,250
But seriously,

678
00:51:19,083 --> 00:51:21,500
she's not useful to anybody except Kob.

679
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,833
This is how you play with zero planning.

680
00:51:30,083 --> 00:51:32,916
Can you see how disorganized they are?

681
00:51:37,958 --> 00:51:40,541
They failed as a team.

682
00:51:48,750 --> 00:51:50,416
Their marksman is a disaster.

683
00:51:51,708 --> 00:51:52,666
Hey, Guide.

684
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:55,375
And who's this BenJay?

685
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:59,000
A teacher at Kob's school.

686
00:51:59,083 --> 00:52:01,458
Her real name's Benjamas.

687
00:52:05,375 --> 00:52:09,000
Hello and welcome to
Garena Special Match 1-1.

688
00:52:09,083 --> 00:52:13,083
Kobsak from Ohmgaga
up against Ohm from Higher.

689
00:52:13,166 --> 00:52:16,166
Both of them have to play Raz
in this head-to-head battle.

690
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,208
Will the upstart outsmart the pro?

691
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:20,416
See you in the game!

692
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:45,666
And who's this BenJay?

693
00:52:47,083 --> 00:52:48,916
A teacher at Kob's school.

694
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,375
Her real name's Benjamas.

695
00:52:52,458 --> 00:52:55,458
Mom, you're playing for Ohmgaga?

696
00:55:20,625 --> 00:55:25,166
And the winner is Ohm from Higher!

697
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:29,666
Ohm's plan was to let Kobsak
come straight at him…

698
00:56:12,833 --> 00:56:15,375
Mom, when I grow up,

699
00:56:16,250 --> 00:56:19,791
I will take you to a mountain

700
00:56:19,875 --> 00:56:22,041
where there's lots of snow.

701
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,416
What will we do on the snowy mountain?

702
00:56:26,916 --> 00:56:28,541
We'll go skiing.

703
00:56:42,458 --> 00:56:49,458
I'LL TALK TO YOU
ONLY AFTER THE TOURNAMENT

704
00:57:02,416 --> 00:57:03,375
Kob,

705
00:57:05,208 --> 00:57:07,708
I want to talk to you about your grades.

706
00:57:09,708 --> 00:57:13,125
Do we have to discuss this now?

707
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:18,750
Wait, it won't take more than a minute.

708
00:57:20,166 --> 00:57:21,583
-No more than a minute?
-Yes.

709
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:23,666
-One minute, right?
-Yes.

710
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,625
Fine.

711
00:57:26,208 --> 00:57:27,625
Is that really necessary?

712
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:30,000
Yes, I'm timing it.

713
00:57:30,083 --> 00:57:31,083
Go!

714
00:57:31,166 --> 00:57:33,291
You got a C in social studies
and a C+ in Thai language.

715
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:35,833
D in math, D in science,
and D in Buddhism.

716
00:57:35,916 --> 00:57:38,250
D+ in Thai music, D+ in computer studies,

717
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:40,833
D in English,
B in health education, A in PE.

718
00:57:40,916 --> 00:57:43,791
Bottom line is,
you won't graduate high school.

719
00:57:43,875 --> 00:57:47,250
You have to do better
in subjects with high credits.

720
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:49,000
At least a C.

721
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:51,750
For subjects with lower credits,
try to get an A,

722
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:53,791
like health education
or PE which is your favorite.

723
00:57:53,875 --> 00:57:55,416
Put them all together,

724
00:57:55,500 --> 00:57:58,208
your GPA will go up
around 0.3 to 0.5 points,

725
00:57:58,291 --> 00:58:00,250
which means you'll pass.

726
00:58:00,333 --> 00:58:03,458
But for math,
I want you to get at least a C.

727
00:58:03,541 --> 00:58:05,750
With free electives,
you can fail as many as you like,

728
00:58:05,833 --> 00:58:07,416
and you'll still graduate!

729
00:58:08,958 --> 00:58:10,041
Just 36 seconds.

730
00:58:11,916 --> 00:58:13,666
Badass!

731
00:58:17,416 --> 00:58:18,458
I have an idea.

732
00:58:19,125 --> 00:58:20,583
You will study hard?

733
00:58:20,666 --> 00:58:23,541
No, I have a better idea.

734
00:58:24,041 --> 00:58:25,500
Ready?

735
00:58:30,291 --> 00:58:31,625
Nakroth, 24 seconds.

736
00:58:33,416 --> 00:58:34,791
Tel'Annas, 35 seconds.

737
00:58:34,875 --> 00:58:36,416
Maloch, 40 seconds.

738
00:58:37,083 --> 00:58:38,833
Raz, 20 seconds.

739
00:58:41,125 --> 00:58:42,625
Nakroth Ult.

740
00:58:45,083 --> 00:58:46,083
Maloch Ult.

741
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:50,125
Tel Ult.

742
00:58:51,250 --> 00:58:52,541
Raz Ult.

743
00:59:01,583 --> 00:59:04,208
Nakroth, 10. Raz, 15. Tel, 27. Maloch, 29.

744
00:59:04,708 --> 00:59:07,625
-Badass!
-Badass!

745
00:59:11,333 --> 00:59:12,333
Not bad?

746
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:15,583
ROUND OF 64 TEAMS

747
00:59:30,333 --> 00:59:33,166
Fight! We'll get to
the offline round soon.

748
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:34,875
-Of course.
-Of course.

749
00:59:34,958 --> 00:59:37,291
All in the mid lane, go invade Red.

750
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,750
Tel is alone, attack it.

751
00:59:40,833 --> 00:59:43,166
No, I don't want to ruin my nails.

752
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:47,208
-Awesome!
-Awesome!

753
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,416
Maprang, cover Ms. Ben.

754
00:59:49,916 --> 00:59:52,541
Relax. Stay in the tower for now, Ms. Ben.

755
01:00:00,291 --> 01:00:01,250
Fourteen.

756
01:00:02,125 --> 01:00:03,291
Thirteen.

757
01:00:03,375 --> 01:00:04,666
And this one?

758
01:00:06,375 --> 01:00:07,958
Ten seconds left. Go for it.

759
01:00:10,625 --> 01:00:13,000
Kob, that one's got Ultimate, careful.

760
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,166
Got you!

761
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:16,958
Max, now!

762
01:00:17,041 --> 01:00:19,250
Got it. Take that!

763
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,583
Nice!

764
01:00:20,666 --> 01:00:22,208
Their timing is perfect.

765
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:24,125
Like they can read our minds.

766
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:25,916
The screen doesn't show a counter, right?

767
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,500
So how do they know how long
until we can use our ultimate skills?

768
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,500
-Kob, you've got five seconds.
-Now!

769
01:00:31,833 --> 01:00:33,375
Maprang, you've got seven seconds.

770
01:00:33,458 --> 01:00:35,500
They will use Ultimate soon, go now!

771
01:00:40,833 --> 01:00:41,875
We're almost there.

772
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,083
Yes!

773
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:49,416
Yes!

774
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:57,041
You're awesome.

775
01:00:57,125 --> 01:00:59,041
So precise like clockwork!

776
01:00:59,125 --> 01:01:02,166
You know the exact moments
to attack or retreat.

777
01:01:02,250 --> 01:01:04,125
Sure. I trained her myself.

778
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:07,416
If there's anything you want,

779
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:08,875
just let me know.

780
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16,166
In that case, can I ask you something?

781
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:17,541
Sure, go ahead.

782
01:01:17,625 --> 01:01:19,541
Now that our ratings have gone up,

783
01:01:19,875 --> 01:01:22,541
can Maprang stop wearing
this cutie-kitten outfit?

784
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,291
Please.

785
01:01:24,833 --> 01:01:27,250
If that's what you want,

786
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:28,166
of course!

787
01:01:30,583 --> 01:01:31,833
Thank you.

788
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:34,875
Just be yourself.

789
01:01:34,958 --> 01:01:36,083
All right.

790
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:38,708
-Hey!
-Wait!

791
01:01:38,791 --> 01:01:41,666
Don't just take your t-shirt off.
Take everything off!

792
01:01:41,750 --> 01:01:42,708
You guys!

793
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:44,333
Hey, Max!

794
01:01:44,416 --> 01:01:45,500
In your dreams!

795
01:01:45,583 --> 01:01:46,750
Let's eat.

796
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:54,166
Actually, I like it all.

797
01:02:03,708 --> 01:02:05,541
How it was before or how it is now.

798
01:02:15,625 --> 01:02:18,583
This pork, I like it however it's cooked.

799
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:24,541
Thought you were talking about me.

800
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:28,791
I was talking about you.

801
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:37,166
This one's for you.

802
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:48,541
Couple of the year.

803
01:02:48,625 --> 01:02:50,458
How come I never knew?

804
01:02:50,541 --> 01:02:52,083
Why should I tell you?

805
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:15,791
Peek-a-boo!

806
01:03:32,083 --> 01:03:34,708
Attention, today we will launch
a new program.

807
01:03:35,333 --> 01:03:37,416
"Phone-Free Classroom" starts now.

808
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,875
We request all students

809
01:03:39,958 --> 01:03:43,541
to leave your phone here
and retrieve it during lunch break.

810
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:47,625
Leave your phone here
and retrieve it during lunch break.

811
01:03:48,208 --> 01:03:49,208
Stop!

812
01:03:50,583 --> 01:03:54,291
Leave your phone here
and retrieve it during lunch break.

813
01:03:54,375 --> 01:03:58,208
Leave your phone here
and retrieve it during lunch break.

814
01:03:58,291 --> 01:04:00,458
Leave your phone…

815
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:04,375
Cellphones are great, but we often
ignore their negative effects.

816
01:04:04,458 --> 01:04:07,041
Statistics show
that 75 percent of Thai youths

817
01:04:07,125 --> 01:04:09,375
use mobile phones without limits.

818
01:04:09,458 --> 01:04:15,208
A total of 42.2 percent
use their phones only to play games.

819
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:18,166
That's why they suffer from
a short attention span.

820
01:04:18,666 --> 01:04:23,166
Research shows that 85 percent
perform poorly

821
01:04:23,250 --> 01:04:25,375
in English and mathematics.

822
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:28,708
Thai students spend
an average of five hours a day in class.

823
01:04:28,791 --> 01:04:33,833
But they spend 4.1 hours a day
on their phones.

824
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:36,125
And the numbers are going up.

825
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:40,666
They don't play sports,
all they do is look at their phones.

826
01:04:40,750 --> 01:04:42,708
So I'd like to propose

827
01:04:42,791 --> 01:04:45,458
the "Phone-Free Classroom" program.

828
01:04:45,541 --> 01:04:47,625
We must come to the conclusion…

829
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:50,958
that mobile phones
are a clear and present threat!

830
01:04:57,916 --> 01:05:00,708
Error Identification Exam guidelines…

831
01:05:00,791 --> 01:05:02,291
ROUND OF 32 TEAMS

832
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:04,166
"Environ…" what?

833
01:05:05,041 --> 01:05:06,125
What "environment"?

834
01:05:07,791 --> 01:05:09,958
This is too hard for me.

835
01:05:27,833 --> 01:05:29,250
Get lost.

836
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:30,875
I don't want to.

837
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:34,625
Kob!

838
01:05:34,708 --> 01:05:35,583
What?

839
01:05:36,416 --> 01:05:37,500
I'll smack your head.

840
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:38,458
Go on.

841
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:44,125
But let me touch your brows.

842
01:05:44,833 --> 01:05:45,666
This is fun!

843
01:06:12,166 --> 01:06:13,708
Stop smiling.

844
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:15,000
Sneaky punk.

845
01:06:26,458 --> 01:06:27,458
Sir,

846
01:06:28,458 --> 01:06:30,791
I was using it to review a lesson.

847
01:06:32,375 --> 01:06:35,000
Not for chatting or playing games.

848
01:06:38,625 --> 01:06:40,833
Ms. Ben sent me the review materials.

849
01:06:40,916 --> 01:06:41,875
Look.

850
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,666
Stop lying, Kobsak.

851
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:48,791
Ms. Benjamas will never allow
her students to use their phones.

852
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:51,041
What do you know?

853
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:53,583
She runs the school's E-Sports team.

854
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:54,916
She's not a dinosaur like you.

855
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:56,291
Look, Kobsak.

856
01:06:57,458 --> 01:07:01,500
I'll never buy your lame excuse.

857
01:07:01,583 --> 01:07:02,708
You know why?

858
01:07:04,625 --> 01:07:09,083
Because the Phone-Free Classroom
is Ms. Benjamas' project.

859
01:07:18,958 --> 01:07:20,500
Not so fast.

860
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,708
Come and get it after school.

861
01:07:37,791 --> 01:07:39,750
I can't reach Kob.

862
01:07:40,916 --> 01:07:41,791
What do we do?

863
01:07:41,875 --> 01:07:43,375
I knew this team would never work!

864
01:07:43,458 --> 01:07:45,291
No, don't say that.

865
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:47,000
You and Max wait here.

866
01:07:47,083 --> 01:07:48,833
We won't give up easily.

867
01:07:51,291 --> 01:07:53,166
The match starts at six.

868
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,250
Six o'clock sharp!

869
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:56,375
Hi, Ms. Ben.

870
01:07:56,458 --> 01:07:58,625
Mr. Tos caught Kob with his phone.

871
01:07:58,708 --> 01:08:02,208
The brat even used your name as an excuse.

872
01:08:02,916 --> 01:08:03,750
Hello, Guide.

873
01:08:03,833 --> 01:08:04,791
What's up, Maprang?

874
01:08:04,875 --> 01:08:06,333
Is Kob with you?

875
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,583
No.

876
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,458
Ask Ohm's mom.

877
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:11,041
She teaches at Kob's school.

878
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,541
What are you talking about?

879
01:08:12,625 --> 01:08:14,916
Oh, so you didn't know?

880
01:08:29,208 --> 01:08:32,000
-Your presentation was amazing.
-Thank you.

881
01:08:32,083 --> 01:08:33,333
Let me take you to dinner.

882
01:08:33,416 --> 01:08:34,291
That's very kind, sir.

883
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:36,375
But I've got something urgent to do.

884
01:08:36,458 --> 01:08:38,291
-Go on then.
-Thanks!

885
01:08:41,041 --> 01:08:42,708
Ms. Ben, where's Kob?

886
01:08:42,791 --> 01:08:44,125
He's in detention.

887
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:45,333
Damn it.

888
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:48,083
Okay. You find a way to get him out.

889
01:08:48,166 --> 01:08:50,125
I'll find a room with Wi-Fi.

890
01:09:09,791 --> 01:09:11,875
You've become a very aggressive boy.

891
01:09:27,208 --> 01:09:30,291
LIBRARY

892
01:09:35,125 --> 01:09:37,333
Look at your penalty points.

893
01:09:37,833 --> 01:09:39,541
One more slip and you're finished.

894
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:42,458
And you've got the nerve
to use Ms. Ben's name.

895
01:09:42,541 --> 01:09:44,166
When I report this to the director,

896
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:46,250
I wonder if you could still be so cocky.

897
01:09:48,041 --> 01:09:51,708
Hey, did you pay any attention
to what I said?

898
01:09:52,291 --> 01:09:54,583
I feel sorry for your parents.

899
01:09:55,125 --> 01:09:57,375
They work hard to pay for your tuition.

900
01:09:57,458 --> 01:10:00,041
But instead of studying,
you create trouble.

901
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:38,791
DIRECTOR WISET'S OFFICE

902
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:42,083
AVAILABLE NETWORKS: DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

903
01:11:03,750 --> 01:11:07,166
Why didn't the janitor lower the flag?

904
01:11:07,250 --> 01:11:09,666
How could he abandon his duty?

905
01:11:10,250 --> 01:11:12,375
Hey, Kobsak! Where are you going?

906
01:11:12,458 --> 01:11:13,958
Stop right there!

907
01:11:14,041 --> 01:11:16,750
Ms. Ben, I've got Wi-Fi.

908
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:19,041
Come to the director's office.

909
01:11:19,916 --> 01:11:21,041
Kobsak!

910
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:23,875
What a trouble maker!

911
01:11:23,958 --> 01:11:25,750
Hey, Kobsak! Wait for me.

912
01:11:28,791 --> 01:11:30,375
Gosh, it burns.

913
01:11:41,333 --> 01:11:42,500
Kobsak!

914
01:11:46,333 --> 01:11:47,583
Oh, shit.

915
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,916
Password? I'm fucked!

916
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:55,541
Shit.

917
01:11:56,708 --> 01:11:58,500
"Greg Norman"?

918
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:01,708
No. That's not it!

919
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:03,458
Maybe Norman Greg?

920
01:12:05,708 --> 01:12:06,750
Wrong again.

921
01:12:08,750 --> 01:12:10,250
Norman111.

922
01:12:11,708 --> 01:12:13,250
Goddamnit!

923
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,208
Do you know the password?

924
01:12:20,791 --> 01:12:21,750
WisetNorman.

925
01:12:25,083 --> 01:12:26,500
Got it.

926
01:12:26,583 --> 01:12:27,416
I'm in.

927
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:29,000
I'm in.

928
01:12:29,500 --> 01:12:30,625
Bank's in.

929
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:32,041
Max's in.

930
01:12:32,750 --> 01:12:34,583
-Where's Kob?
-Kob.

931
01:12:34,666 --> 01:12:35,875
Where the hell are you?

932
01:13:08,916 --> 01:13:10,208
Kob's in!

933
01:13:29,125 --> 01:13:30,541
Help me in my lane, Ms. Ben.

934
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:32,791
Coming. Don't rush in, Bank.

935
01:13:35,500 --> 01:13:37,458
I'm dead!

936
01:13:40,333 --> 01:13:42,250
I'll cover you.

937
01:13:45,458 --> 01:13:47,041
Shit, my battery!

938
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,875
Find a charger.

939
01:13:54,250 --> 01:13:55,333
It's in here.

940
01:13:56,125 --> 01:13:57,458
There it is.

941
01:13:58,291 --> 01:14:00,416
I'll cover you.

942
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,500
Keep playing.

943
01:14:04,708 --> 01:14:06,625
Hey, I'm still in the toilet.

944
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:07,958
I'm still here!

945
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:14,000
-Oh, my god!
-A blackout, seriously?

946
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:18,333
I was in the toilet,
why did you turn off the light?

947
01:14:18,875 --> 01:14:20,250
Who the hell are you?

948
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:21,708
I'm the school director.

949
01:14:21,791 --> 01:14:22,916
Help me, Maprang.

950
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,416
Give me a second.

951
01:14:28,375 --> 01:14:30,250
"Director Wiset Kasiwara."

952
01:14:30,333 --> 01:14:32,375
It's really you. I'm sorry.

953
01:14:32,458 --> 01:14:34,625
I did not recognize you
without your cowboy hat.

954
01:14:34,708 --> 01:14:36,208
I'm really sorry, Director.

955
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:39,083
My hat?

956
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:41,791
Right, I must have left it in my office.

957
01:14:41,875 --> 01:14:43,958
Could you turn on the light for a minute?

958
01:14:44,791 --> 01:14:47,125
-Oh, my!
-Oh, gosh!

959
01:14:47,208 --> 01:14:48,625
It's back on.

960
01:14:48,708 --> 01:14:49,666
Go!

961
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,625
-Get Dark Slayer first.
-Okay.

962
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:53,416
You shoot, I'll tank it.

963
01:14:53,500 --> 01:14:54,416
I got it.

964
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:55,625
Go!

965
01:15:00,041 --> 01:15:01,708
Yes!

966
01:15:02,708 --> 01:15:03,708
Good job, everyone.

967
01:15:03,791 --> 01:15:05,000
We won.

968
01:15:06,916 --> 01:15:07,833
Cool.

969
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:16,125
Ms. Ben?

970
01:15:16,958 --> 01:15:18,083
What's going on here?

971
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:22,333
Just playing games, sir.

972
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,625
Kob! Maprang!

973
01:15:34,625 --> 01:15:35,833
Are you guys okay?

974
01:15:38,375 --> 01:15:40,458
Are you hiding something from us?

975
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:47,916
This Phone-Free Classroom project

976
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:51,083
is your brainchild, right?

977
01:15:56,416 --> 01:15:57,333
Yes.

978
01:16:02,166 --> 01:16:05,166
And Ohm?

979
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:07,416
Is he your son?

980
01:16:15,833 --> 01:16:16,750
Yes.

981
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:25,250
Ohm's your son?

982
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:29,416
What are you trying to do?

983
01:16:33,375 --> 01:16:35,083
Why did you lie to us?

984
01:16:37,333 --> 01:16:38,291
Say it.

985
01:16:46,666 --> 01:16:48,916
I want my son to quit playing games.

986
01:16:49,583 --> 01:16:53,083
So you're using us?

987
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:01,083
Ohmgaga, right?

988
01:17:03,750 --> 01:17:04,916
I quit.

989
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:08,083
Kob.

990
01:17:33,791 --> 01:17:39,708
HI, ORN. I ACCEPT THE LOAN AGREEMENT.

991
01:17:45,625 --> 01:17:47,083
Hi.

992
01:17:47,166 --> 01:17:48,333
Hi, Best.

993
01:17:48,833 --> 01:17:51,375
I agree to pay the compensation.

994
01:18:03,291 --> 01:18:04,750
Have you eaten, son?

995
01:18:06,833 --> 01:18:08,125
Ohm?

996
01:18:35,666 --> 01:18:37,541
Have you ever asked me

997
01:18:40,333 --> 01:18:42,250
what I want to do with my life?

998
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:06,541
Have you ever asked me…

999
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:11,208
what I want to do with my life?

1000
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:06,208
STUDENTS ON DISCIPLINARY PROBATION

1001
01:20:06,291 --> 01:20:09,416
KOBSAK WONGVIJITSUK

1002
01:21:37,791 --> 01:21:38,791
Max!

1003
01:21:39,583 --> 01:21:40,458
Max!

1004
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:42,625
Max!

1005
01:21:42,708 --> 01:21:44,166
Who are you?

1006
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:45,791
Max's not home.

1007
01:21:45,875 --> 01:21:48,583
-I'm a teacher, my name's Ben.
-A teacher?

1008
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:50,041
Is Max in trouble?

1009
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:52,666
No! He's not in trouble.

1010
01:21:53,750 --> 01:21:56,041
What are you doing here?

1011
01:21:56,958 --> 01:21:59,875
What did you do, Max?

1012
01:21:59,958 --> 01:22:01,291
Pain in the ass.

1013
01:22:02,708 --> 01:22:04,583
Do you know where Kob lives?

1014
01:22:05,875 --> 01:22:06,875
Follow me.

1015
01:22:07,708 --> 01:22:09,333
No worries, he's not in trouble.

1016
01:22:13,958 --> 01:22:14,958
Where is it?

1017
01:22:15,041 --> 01:22:16,083
We're almost there.

1018
01:22:20,250 --> 01:22:21,791
There he is.

1019
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:36,625
Why can't you leave me alone?

1020
01:22:37,916 --> 01:22:39,083
Get lost now.

1021
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:41,291
I apologize.

1022
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:43,500
But please don't quit.

1023
01:22:48,291 --> 01:22:49,708
Don't quit what?

1024
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:52,083
School or games?

1025
01:22:54,625 --> 01:22:56,791
I suck at everything anyway.

1026
01:22:58,541 --> 01:22:59,916
So what's the point?

1027
01:23:01,958 --> 01:23:03,791
I'll quit every goddamn thing.

1028
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:12,750
You lied to me.

1029
01:23:13,833 --> 01:23:15,333
You lied to your own son.

1030
01:23:16,125 --> 01:23:17,583
You lied to all of us.

1031
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:24,291
Yes, I lied to everyone.

1032
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:25,500
I'm selfish.

1033
01:23:26,291 --> 01:23:29,000
I'm a bad teacher and a worse mother.

1034
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:35,375
But I never lied about one thing.

1035
01:23:37,333 --> 01:23:40,666
I was so happy when I played games
with you guys.

1036
01:23:51,416 --> 01:23:54,666
I think my son must feel the same.

1037
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:12,291
I've made up my mind.

1038
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:15,125
I want to play with you again.

1039
01:24:26,291 --> 01:24:28,166
I will set up an E-Sports club.

1040
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:12,083
Mom, when I grow up,

1041
01:25:12,875 --> 01:25:16,166
I'll take you to a mountain

1042
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,541
where there's lots of snow.

1043
01:25:20,916 --> 01:25:23,083
What will we do on the snowy mountain?

1044
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:24,708
We'll go skiing.

1045
01:25:35,125 --> 01:25:38,541
Welcome to the Round of 16…

1046
01:25:38,625 --> 01:25:42,375
-of Road to Arena of Valor 2019.
-Of Road to Arena of Valor 2019.

1047
01:25:46,291 --> 01:25:48,583
From a thousand teams
from all over Thailand,

1048
01:25:48,666 --> 01:25:51,958
we are down to the last 16.

1049
01:25:52,041 --> 01:25:56,625
Only one of them
will get to represent Thailand

1050
01:25:56,708 --> 01:25:58,958
in the world championship in South Korea.

1051
01:26:12,041 --> 01:26:13,458
What are you doing here?

1052
01:26:16,208 --> 01:26:19,041
I'm here to cancel the agreement
to pay the compensation.

1053
01:26:22,541 --> 01:26:25,458
You have my permission to let Ohm compete.

1054
01:26:28,833 --> 01:26:30,958
I'm a man of my word, ma'am.

1055
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:34,750
I removed Ohm after you called me.

1056
01:26:35,833 --> 01:26:38,500
And now I trust my first-team squad.

1057
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:46,083
But Ohm is your best player.

1058
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:49,166
I agree with you on that,

1059
01:26:51,000 --> 01:26:54,708
but Higher is Higher
because we believe in teamwork.

1060
01:26:55,916 --> 01:26:58,250
And now I believe in my team.

1061
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:04,500
Please leave now.

1062
01:27:05,541 --> 01:27:08,250
Don't make things worse.

1063
01:27:09,083 --> 01:27:10,791
Go back to your team.

1064
01:27:11,791 --> 01:27:14,041
My guys need to concentrate.

1065
01:27:28,958 --> 01:27:32,083
SCHEDULE

1066
01:27:36,333 --> 01:27:39,375
Let's start with Ohmgaga.

1067
01:27:39,458 --> 01:27:42,958
They've been amazing, don't you think?
Ohmgaga is impressive on every front.

1068
01:27:43,041 --> 01:27:48,041
At the start, they ran into
some trouble in the bottom lane.

1069
01:27:48,125 --> 01:27:50,291
But with Nakroth's Split-Push,

1070
01:27:50,375 --> 01:27:52,333
they turned the situation around
and won the game.

1071
01:27:52,416 --> 01:27:55,250
Kobsak was brilliant.

1072
01:27:55,333 --> 01:27:57,500
His AutoQ11 has done a great job.

1073
01:27:57,583 --> 01:28:01,125
The first team to go through
to the next round is…

1074
01:28:01,625 --> 01:28:03,916
Ohmgaga!

1075
01:28:10,500 --> 01:28:12,458
Higher is the tournament's favorite.

1076
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:14,791
But the team missed Ohm SonicFighter
in the first round,

1077
01:28:14,875 --> 01:28:16,250
and things didn't run smoothly.

1078
01:28:16,333 --> 01:28:19,708
They won but it was a narrow win.

1079
01:28:19,791 --> 01:28:22,291
Let's see if they'll bounce back
in the next round.

1080
01:28:28,000 --> 01:28:29,000
In the quarter-finals,

1081
01:28:29,083 --> 01:28:31,500
Ohmgaga played
with such astonishing teamwork.

1082
01:28:31,583 --> 01:28:33,166
Especially Ms. BenJay.

1083
01:28:33,250 --> 01:28:37,500
A real ass-kicker for someone her age.

1084
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:39,333
Such incredible skills.

1085
01:28:39,416 --> 01:28:42,041
That's why Ohmgaga
is the dark horse of the season.

1086
01:28:47,166 --> 01:28:48,958
-It's good!
-Kill it!

1087
01:28:51,041 --> 01:28:53,916
Can Higher go any higher?

1088
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,208
Their coach comes prepared
with a masterly playbook.

1089
01:28:57,291 --> 01:29:00,250
They're doing much better
than we expected.

1090
01:29:02,125 --> 01:29:04,041
All in the mid lane.

1091
01:29:05,166 --> 01:29:07,291
Maprang, go.

1092
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:08,458
Got it.

1093
01:29:08,541 --> 01:29:10,041
-That's it!
-Now, Ms. Ben.

1094
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:12,750
Go!

1095
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:17,500
Unbelievable!
Ohmgaga has made it to the finals!

1096
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:21,041
They've played with such flair
and team spirit.

1097
01:29:21,125 --> 01:29:24,416
Ohmgaga is playing in the final round!

1098
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:27,833
-BenJay!
-BenJay!

1099
01:29:27,916 --> 01:29:29,625
-BenJay!
-Stop.

1100
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:30,916
SCHEDULE

1101
01:29:31,750 --> 01:29:32,875
Destroy the tower!

1102
01:29:35,208 --> 01:29:37,666
That's it! Now we have the two finalists!

1103
01:29:37,750 --> 01:29:40,166
Ohmgaga vs. Higher.

1104
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:43,041
It could also be Mother vs. Son!

1105
01:29:43,125 --> 01:29:47,000
BenJay up against SonicFighter.

1106
01:29:47,083 --> 01:29:50,666
Let's see who'll come out on top.
This is the final game you can't miss!

1107
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:02,000
Get the marksman first.

1108
01:30:02,708 --> 01:30:04,958
Locked, three, two, one!

1109
01:30:06,250 --> 01:30:09,583
Ohmgaga is going full throttle.

1110
01:30:09,666 --> 01:30:12,875
They move smoothly as one, up and down.

1111
01:30:12,958 --> 01:30:16,083
BenJay, their marksman,
is improving every second.

1112
01:30:16,166 --> 01:30:17,916
Her skills are still limited,

1113
01:30:18,000 --> 01:30:20,500
but her attacking moves are so clinical.

1114
01:30:20,583 --> 01:30:22,750
And watch Maprang.

1115
01:30:22,833 --> 01:30:25,250
Her timing is perfect.

1116
01:30:25,333 --> 01:30:27,083
She was a substitute
when she was with Higher.

1117
01:30:27,166 --> 01:30:30,000
How is that? She's better than
their first-team players!

1118
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:31,291
-I agree.
-That's it.

1119
01:30:34,791 --> 01:30:36,333
Go in and attack.

1120
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:38,500
Yes.

1121
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:51,333
-That was easy.
-The all-time favorite Higher

1122
01:30:51,416 --> 01:30:53,458
has lost the first game to Ohmgaga.

1123
01:30:53,541 --> 01:30:55,666
This is going to be epic!

1124
01:30:55,750 --> 01:30:58,541
Higher will have to come back stronger
in the next game.

1125
01:31:10,541 --> 01:31:12,666
Higher seems a little tense.

1126
01:31:12,750 --> 01:31:14,916
They aren't at their best.

1127
01:31:15,000 --> 01:31:17,083
Perhaps it's pressure
from having lost the first game.

1128
01:31:17,166 --> 01:31:20,208
Or it's because they don't have their
talisman, Ohm, known as SonicFighter.

1129
01:31:20,291 --> 01:31:21,500
Lock it for me.

1130
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:31,083
BenJay's items are full to the tilt!

1131
01:31:31,166 --> 01:31:33,500
They're ready to close the book on Higher!

1132
01:31:34,833 --> 01:31:35,750
Go!

1133
01:31:36,291 --> 01:31:38,375
That's nice, keep going!

1134
01:31:38,875 --> 01:31:40,458
There's a fight here.

1135
01:31:40,541 --> 01:31:42,458
Watch BenJay closely.

1136
01:31:42,541 --> 01:31:46,000
Her Valhein has crushed
007x so forcefully.

1137
01:31:46,083 --> 01:31:48,666
Look at that!

1138
01:31:48,750 --> 01:31:51,250
Another one bites the dust.

1139
01:31:54,166 --> 01:31:56,375
THE BLUE TEAM'S CORE IS DESTROYED!

1140
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:59,750
Kobsak's Murad surged past everyone
to get to the Core.

1141
01:31:59,833 --> 01:32:03,083
It's done! Ohmgaga is up 2-0.

1142
01:32:03,666 --> 01:32:05,208
Yes!

1143
01:32:10,416 --> 01:32:12,958
Ohmgaga is up 2-0.

1144
01:32:13,041 --> 01:32:15,666
Will Higher find a way to come back?

1145
01:32:15,750 --> 01:32:18,250
See you after the break.

1146
01:32:24,375 --> 01:32:25,500
We're screwed.

1147
01:32:26,375 --> 01:32:28,000
You have to let Ohm play.

1148
01:32:28,833 --> 01:32:30,875
Ohmgaga knows all our moves.

1149
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:37,791
We can turn things around.

1150
01:32:38,833 --> 01:32:40,916
You have to believe in Higher's system.

1151
01:32:42,375 --> 01:32:46,416
We've come this far and we will beat them.

1152
01:32:49,250 --> 01:32:53,666
They play purely by instinct.

1153
01:32:55,000 --> 01:32:59,708
No fucking qualification at all.
They've been lucky since the first match.

1154
01:33:03,208 --> 01:33:04,041
They will slip.

1155
01:33:05,208 --> 01:33:06,375
Slip?

1156
01:33:06,958 --> 01:33:08,416
How?

1157
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:11,416
They play like they can read
each other's minds.

1158
01:33:11,500 --> 01:33:13,125
We're a total failure.

1159
01:33:13,208 --> 01:33:15,583
We play like shit.

1160
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:19,958
You have to admit that
Ohm is our key player.

1161
01:33:22,583 --> 01:33:25,791
Our plans aren't working
because he's not here.

1162
01:33:30,166 --> 01:33:33,000
Do you still think he's dispensable?

1163
01:33:46,916 --> 01:33:48,208
Go get him then.

1164
01:35:05,916 --> 01:35:07,875
This is our re-match, Ohm.

1165
01:35:09,875 --> 01:35:12,375
Our victory would mean something

1166
01:35:12,458 --> 01:35:16,041
only if we beat Ohm.

1167
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:21,250
Ohm, you wet fart, prepare to die!

1168
01:35:21,333 --> 01:35:23,791
You'll cry like a baby
when we beat the shit out of you.

1169
01:35:23,875 --> 01:35:25,208
Fucking loser.

1170
01:35:25,291 --> 01:35:26,916
Get your hands off me.

1171
01:35:43,000 --> 01:35:44,875
Now, this is exciting!

1172
01:35:44,958 --> 01:35:47,125
Ohm SonicFighter is taking his seat.

1173
01:35:47,208 --> 01:35:50,666
Let's see if Ohmgaga will take it home

1174
01:35:50,750 --> 01:35:54,208
or if Higher will live
to fight another round.

1175
01:36:30,291 --> 01:36:31,750
I'm here, go on!

1176
01:36:36,750 --> 01:36:38,208
This isn't good.

1177
01:36:38,291 --> 01:36:39,375
Go back!

1178
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:40,708
Take out Dragon.

1179
01:36:40,791 --> 01:36:41,875
Dragon!

1180
01:36:44,666 --> 01:36:45,916
My HP is low.

1181
01:36:46,500 --> 01:36:48,125
Stall it.

1182
01:36:48,208 --> 01:36:49,166
Wait for me.

1183
01:36:52,208 --> 01:36:54,000
Go back!

1184
01:36:56,666 --> 01:36:57,958
All in the mid lane.

1185
01:36:58,041 --> 01:36:59,750
All in.

1186
01:37:00,541 --> 01:37:01,833
An eye for an eye!

1187
01:37:03,541 --> 01:37:05,208
Thanks. Go.

1188
01:37:07,083 --> 01:37:08,625
Protect the Core.

1189
01:37:14,541 --> 01:37:15,666
Destroyed!

1190
01:37:16,458 --> 01:37:17,458
That's it!

1191
01:37:20,916 --> 01:37:22,958
Higher has outclassed Ohmgaga.

1192
01:37:23,041 --> 01:37:25,333
Ohm SonicFighter has turned
the game around.

1193
01:37:25,416 --> 01:37:27,708
He was superb as Kriknak.

1194
01:37:28,208 --> 01:37:30,083
He rescued his team from a crisis.

1195
01:37:30,166 --> 01:37:33,500
We have to credit Best
for his choice of players too.

1196
01:37:33,583 --> 01:37:35,000
It was brilliant!

1197
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:38,041
Told you to let Ohm play.

1198
01:37:53,666 --> 01:37:56,291
Ohmgaga opts to ban Kriknak,

1199
01:37:56,375 --> 01:37:57,708
played by SonicFighter.

1200
01:37:57,791 --> 01:38:00,666
He was so good that
the character is now banned.

1201
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:03,625
We call it a respect ban.

1202
01:38:03,708 --> 01:38:05,666
It happens when a team bans
another team's hero

1203
01:38:05,750 --> 01:38:07,250
out of respect for exceptional skills.

1204
01:38:07,333 --> 01:38:08,958
Kriknak is now out of the game.

1205
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:10,666
But banning Kriknak means

1206
01:38:10,750 --> 01:38:13,041
they've freed other
often-banned heroes like Elsu.

1207
01:38:13,125 --> 01:38:16,958
Let's see if this ban is the right move.

1208
01:38:17,041 --> 01:38:21,125
Because Higher is the Blue Side
and will pick first.

1209
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:38,291
Ohmgaga had no idea that
Higher would play Jungle Elsu.

1210
01:38:38,791 --> 01:38:41,666
But Ohm SonicFighter will have
to play in a new style,

1211
01:38:41,750 --> 01:38:45,375
because usually,
he prefers to play the assassin.

1212
01:38:45,458 --> 01:38:47,958
Now he's moved to play the marksman.

1213
01:38:48,041 --> 01:38:50,416
Let's see if Ohmgaga
will be able to handle him.

1214
01:38:51,083 --> 01:38:54,916
Why did he pick this hero?

1215
01:39:32,708 --> 01:39:36,666
Ohm SonicFighter is a genius player!
He's just unbelievable.

1216
01:39:36,750 --> 01:39:39,333
This Jungle Elsu is really something!

1217
01:39:43,208 --> 01:39:46,458
Maprang with a great run here.

1218
01:39:46,541 --> 01:39:50,375
Bank with a slam-bang Cataclysm!
That was smooth.

1219
01:39:50,458 --> 01:39:52,291
Bank almost got hit but he backed away.

1220
01:39:52,375 --> 01:39:54,125
A chance to use Ulti anyway.

1221
01:39:54,208 --> 01:39:55,916
Did Romeo get his target?

1222
01:39:56,000 --> 01:39:57,958
It's his payback from the last shot.

1223
01:40:01,291 --> 01:40:04,333
Well, now what? There's a duel happening.

1224
01:40:04,416 --> 01:40:06,041
A duel between AutoQ and Enictuz.

1225
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:08,000
Can he handle that? 

1226
01:40:08,583 --> 01:40:10,208
A terrible miss!

1227
01:40:10,291 --> 01:40:12,083
It doesn't look good in mid lane.

1228
01:40:12,166 --> 01:40:13,416
Max in the top lane.

1229
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:15,333
But SonicFighter is ambushing him.

1230
01:40:15,416 --> 01:40:17,041
Max is down.

1231
01:40:17,125 --> 01:40:19,791
It's going to be a tough call from there.

1232
01:40:19,875 --> 01:40:22,041
A duel in Dark Slayer…

1233
01:40:22,125 --> 01:40:23,625
AutoQ bamboozled him.

1234
01:40:28,166 --> 01:40:31,291
Dead on the ground!

1235
01:40:38,250 --> 01:40:42,208
Higher seems to enjoy
more and more advantages.

1236
01:40:42,291 --> 01:40:44,416
BenJay is farming too much
in the mid lane.

1237
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:47,875
KritNgi came in from the left
and solo-killed her.

1238
01:40:47,958 --> 01:40:51,250
That's bad.
BenJay is the team's main attacker.

1239
01:40:51,333 --> 01:40:55,750
Ohmgaga are being taken out one by one.

1240
01:40:55,833 --> 01:40:59,041
Their backs are against the wall.

1241
01:40:59,125 --> 01:41:02,500
Why didn't Ohm finish off Ms. Ben himself?

1242
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:08,041
Let's keep going.
AutoQ up against SonicFighter.

1243
01:41:08,125 --> 01:41:10,708
It's a duel.

1244
01:41:10,791 --> 01:41:12,708
But no, he's out!

1245
01:41:20,708 --> 01:41:23,250
Higher finally did it.

1246
01:41:23,333 --> 01:41:26,833
They beat Ohmgaga two games straight.

1247
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:31,583
The score is tied at 2-2.

1248
01:41:31,666 --> 01:41:34,625
SonicFighter was instrumental
in the turnaround of the game.

1249
01:41:44,125 --> 01:41:46,625
They have won two games in a row,

1250
01:41:46,708 --> 01:41:50,833
and now we're going into the final battle.

1251
01:41:52,500 --> 01:41:55,791
What the hell was that, huh?

1252
01:41:58,500 --> 01:42:00,625
I paid a lot for this jacket!

1253
01:42:02,708 --> 01:42:06,833
Don't worry. I have a plan for Ms. Ben.

1254
01:42:14,041 --> 01:42:18,041
We're going into the do-or-die final game.

1255
01:42:18,125 --> 01:42:21,958
The winners will be
the champions of Thailand.

1256
01:43:07,416 --> 01:43:09,750
Ohmgaga has picked Raz.

1257
01:43:09,833 --> 01:43:11,708
I don't know what they're thinking.

1258
01:43:11,791 --> 01:43:14,916
Will they put Raz up against Nakroth
played by SonicFighter?

1259
01:43:15,000 --> 01:43:19,208
It doesn't look good
because BenJay will play Raz.

1260
01:43:19,291 --> 01:43:22,375
Unusual, because so far
she has only played the marksman.

1261
01:43:28,708 --> 01:43:30,958
This game is going to be so unpredictable.

1262
01:43:31,041 --> 01:43:33,000
Raz versus Nakroth!

1263
01:43:33,083 --> 01:43:36,541
It's BenJay against SonicFighter.

1264
01:43:47,375 --> 01:43:49,250
Higher are switching plans.

1265
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,750
They know we know their moves.

1266
01:43:57,291 --> 01:43:58,666
I'm fucked.

1267
01:44:02,166 --> 01:44:05,125
Top Lane! They're heading to our Core!

1268
01:44:10,500 --> 01:44:11,833
I'll warp there.

1269
01:44:13,458 --> 01:44:15,500
You can't! It takes time to recall!

1270
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:18,500
DarkBlood alone
won't be able to stop them.

1271
01:44:18,583 --> 01:44:20,166
It's relentless!

1272
01:44:20,250 --> 01:44:23,541
AutoQ as Volkath comes charging in!

1273
01:44:27,541 --> 01:44:29,458
But hey, look at this battle.

1274
01:44:29,541 --> 01:44:32,583
SonicFighter and BenJay,
the son against the mother!

1275
01:44:32,666 --> 01:44:35,458
If BenJay can stop SonicFighter's Nakroth,

1276
01:44:35,541 --> 01:44:38,583
her team will have a chance
of coming back.

1277
01:44:38,666 --> 01:44:39,875
Can BenJay stop her son?

1278
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:42,000
Go for it, Mom.

1279
01:45:42,583 --> 01:45:44,083
Don't let me down.

1280
01:48:18,708 --> 01:48:19,791
Go for it, Mom.

1281
01:48:20,375 --> 01:48:21,958
Don't let me down.

1282
01:48:56,375 --> 01:48:58,375
Finally, we have the winner!

1283
01:48:58,458 --> 01:49:01,041
BenJay took down SonicFighter,

1284
01:49:01,125 --> 01:49:04,541
but it was SonicFighter's trap

1285
01:49:04,625 --> 01:49:07,833
so that he could send minions to the Core,
and AutoQ couldn't stop them.

1286
01:49:07,916 --> 01:49:11,541
The winner is Higher!

1287
01:49:22,500 --> 01:49:24,291
I'm sorry.

1288
01:49:24,375 --> 01:49:26,000
I really sucked.

1289
01:49:27,375 --> 01:49:29,791
You beat your son to a pulp.

1290
01:49:30,333 --> 01:49:34,000
It's all right, Ms. Ben.
We got further than expected.

1291
01:49:34,083 --> 01:49:36,541
Ohmgaga is the coolest team anyway.

1292
01:49:38,708 --> 01:49:40,083
Was it fun?

1293
01:49:42,208 --> 01:49:45,083
You're so awesome, for real.

1294
01:49:45,166 --> 01:49:47,666
How many math teachers
have ever been in an RoV final?

1295
01:49:47,750 --> 01:49:48,625
Right?

1296
01:49:48,708 --> 01:49:50,041
Thank you.

1297
01:49:50,125 --> 01:49:51,250
Give me a hug.

1298
01:50:16,875 --> 01:50:20,041
So tell me, what is E-Sports?

1299
01:50:20,666 --> 01:50:24,083
Sometimes people watch us play

1300
01:50:24,833 --> 01:50:28,083
and say we are stupid

1301
01:50:29,041 --> 01:50:31,541
for choosing wrong characters

1302
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:35,333
or taking impossible risks.

1303
01:50:36,375 --> 01:50:37,833
But the thing is

1304
01:50:38,666 --> 01:50:45,250
we can always try to stick with our style
and strategy, adapt to our opponents,

1305
01:50:46,125 --> 01:50:49,083
or deal with whatever's in front of us.

1306
01:50:50,125 --> 01:50:51,375
FEBRUARY 8: OHM'S MATCH IN KOREA

1307
01:50:51,458 --> 01:50:56,458
But still, there's no guarantee
that we're making the right choice.

1308
01:50:56,958 --> 01:51:01,041
We may think
that a certain plan will lead to victory.

1309
01:51:02,250 --> 01:51:04,833
But even with the best plan,
we can still lose.

1310
01:51:04,916 --> 01:51:06,000
Actually,

1311
01:51:06,875 --> 01:51:11,041
E-Sports is like life.

1312
01:51:11,958 --> 01:51:15,500
Why do you think
you've been named the MVP 

1313
01:51:15,583 --> 01:51:18,625
 or the most valuable player
in this tournament?

1314
01:51:19,791 --> 01:51:21,625
Of course it wasn't just me.

1315
01:51:23,083 --> 01:51:25,125
My teammates are valuable players too.

1316
01:51:26,833 --> 01:51:30,666
We're different, but we're a team.

1317
01:51:32,791 --> 01:51:35,583
STUDY HARD. OKAY?

1318
01:51:35,666 --> 01:51:38,166
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I GET THERE.

1319
01:51:44,000 --> 01:51:48,875
We fight in different lanes,
but we always support each other.

1320
01:51:52,083 --> 01:51:55,291
COME BACK SOON. I MISS YOU ALREADY.

1321
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:05,583
Whether you win or lose,

1322
01:52:06,375 --> 01:52:08,458
they're always there for you.

1323
01:52:10,666 --> 01:52:12,166
I'm the MVP

1324
01:52:13,958 --> 01:52:16,250
because of them.

1325
01:52:17,708 --> 01:52:20,708
And who is your MVP?

1326
01:52:30,916 --> 01:52:32,125
My mother.

1327
01:52:55,166 --> 01:52:57,791
After ten minutes, stop playing.
