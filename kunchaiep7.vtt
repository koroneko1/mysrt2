00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Once he gets married, 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
one week after, he can take the position.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.000
I've looked for the auspicious time.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.000
A month and a half?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.000
The auspicious time for wedding can't be postponed.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
No matter what, I'll interrupt your wedding.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
but you won't be able to inherit from Father. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
My brother's happiness must come first.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.000
Tian is getting married in a month and a half?

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.000
Yes. 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.000
I would like you to send me news.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000
I will handle this myself. 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.000
If you are successful, 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.000
I will give you the medicine formula used to treat your sister.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.000
Just tell me who do you want me to kill.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.000
I want you to kill the Song's eldest son.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
And if this is revealed, 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.000
Tian's secret that we're struggling to hide may be exposed again.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
What is Tian's secret?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We have asked herbal shops and pharmacies across the town, 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.000
but no one can explain about this mushroom.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Then our assumption might be true 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000
that this mushroom is probably related to the chaos in our house.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.000
Right. 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.000
In the past, Song family had a Chinese doctor

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.000
Where is he now?

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.000
Doctor Qi who was here?

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.000
I heard that he's back to Chonburi.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.000
If we meet Doctor Qi, we'll know what mushroom it is, 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.000
and if it has anything to do with the mystery in our home.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
I call everyone to come here today

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
because I have good news to inform you. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
In another month and a half, 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
there will be an auspicious event of Tian.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
So I want to take everyone to pay respects to the god

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
at the Song family's shrine in Chonburi.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So I want everyone to get ready.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.000
We will depart tomorrow.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
This is a good opportunity. 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.000
If we go to Chonburi, we'll get to find Doctor Qi.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Soon we'll know how this mushroom is related to our family. 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.000
Yes. 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Yang, what if the thing we suspect comes true?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
That Tian's secret made Madam Li kill a man like Chan said.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.000
Why do you believe that Tian has a secret?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I've secretly overheard Madam Li talking to Jia.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000
I wanted to ask you a few days ago.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Yang, you knew it, right?

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.000
What is Tian's secret?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Yang.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
If you know it, please tell me.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
If there's a problem, we can solve it together.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.000
I'm worried about Tian as well.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
But we can't fix anything.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Can't fix ? Why not?

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Since Tian is a good man. 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.000
What secret that is so serious and sinful?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000
It should be nothing.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Is there any secret that is too hard to fix it?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
But it's hard to say, I can't say it.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Even though you can't say it, you must speak.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Father.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
What is Tian's secret?

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Bao.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
What's the matter, Madam?

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Where is Mr. Song?

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000
When I came here, he wasn't here anymore.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000
He isn't in the bedroom. Where has he gone?

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000
So what is it?

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
You guys are talking about Tian's secret.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000
What is his secret?

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
There are many chaos in our family right now. 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.000
Since Dong died, strange things happen. 

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Li acts as if she has something hidden. 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Chan blames her for killing Dong. 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And now you two are also hiding something from me as well?

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000
Bua. 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Why did you ask Yang about Tian's secret?

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Well…

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000
I'm just worried about Mr. Tian.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.000
I think he might be stressed about the secret Madam Chan usually mentions, Sir.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Really?

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.000
Yes. 

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Yang.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
You said it can't be undone. 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000
What do you mean?

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Well, if you heard it just now, 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
you should hear the same that I can't said it. It's difficult to explain. 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Are you going to play this trick?

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Fine. 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Getting on my nerves to hide the truth?

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000
I will ask Tian and Li instead. 

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Okay. 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
But if you know it, 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
don't scold Tian.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000
I asked him to keep me company last night to go out and disobeyed your order.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Then Bua doubted this and caught me.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
So she just asked me that's all. 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
This is it?

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.000
That you said you can't fix it.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Don't think that it's just this small.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Last time I got beaten until my back hurt.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Tian is a good man, so he kept thinking

00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:17.000
and was afraid that if I get caught, I'll get hit again.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000
It's not very serious.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.000
Don't punish Mr. Yang, Sir.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Yang. 

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000
I'm your father.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
You're lying.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Do you think that I don't know this?

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Secret?

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Does Mr. Tian really have something hidden?

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Your conversation hasn't finished yet?

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000
At first I thought there was only Chan. 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Now Bua and Mr. Yang also talked about it. 

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.000
That's right. 

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000
If Chan talked about it alone, 

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.000
I would think that she was trying to slander Li. 

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000
Or does Mr. Yang want to help Madam Chan?

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:34.000
They're mother and son. They might want to help each other.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000
No. 

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Even if this son is useless, 

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000
he's not that kind of guy.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000
What are you going to do?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Forcing Mr. Yang to speak the truth?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Even if you I force him, he'll probably lie like this time. 

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Tian's secret

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
is not just about escaping to hang out like he said.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
But now we can't do anything besides being silent.

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000
We have to keep an eye on all my children and wives. 

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Especially Li. 

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
What do you suspect Madam Li?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Now do you think what she said

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000
that Madam killed Dong to hide Mr. Tian's secret was true?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000
I won't believe anything 

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
until I have evidence.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
This job is very important.

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.000
Don't make a mistake.

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:50.000
If you are successful, 

00:10:50.300 --> 00:10:54.000
I will give you the medicine formula used to treat your sister.

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:58.000
You will be free. You can do whatever you want in the future.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000
You don't have to take my job in exchange for medicine to cure your sister again.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Mr. Ma said that you can't make a mistake this time.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.000
When you get there, notice the person carrying a blue handkerchief.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:24.000
She will be the one to lure Mr. Song's eldest son out for you to kill him. 

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Prepare enough food for everyone.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
We are staying overnight. Don't miss it.

00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:40.000
So once we reach the shrine, you won't have to buy it again. 

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:41.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
And is the stuff I let you prepared ready?

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.000
You're welcome.

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.000
So carry the stuff to the car.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:49.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000
What is the stuff?

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Just in case I meet Dr. Qi, Madam.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.000
I've heard that he had returned from China and has lived in Chonburi.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Song Family visit there every year. He might hear the news and visit us. 

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
I haven't seen him in a long time.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000
If we meet this time, you will be very happy.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
I have knowledge of herbs to take care of you and Mr. Song like today

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000
because he taught me. 

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
He has always been considerate of me

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
like a teacher and a brother to me. 

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Let's go. 

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Bua, let's go. 

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Everything is ready. Let's go.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000
When you get there, keep an eye on Tian. 

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Don't let him out of sight.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.000
Keep reporting me.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:07.000
If you're ready, let's go.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Bua, the car is over there.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.000
Yes, Mr. Tian. Let's go, Mr. Yang.

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.000
Yes. 

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000
You guys, get in the car now.
177
00:13:58,000 --&gt; 00:13:40,000
Chonburi.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Mr. Song, please come in.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
You must be tired from traveling. I'll find something for you to drink.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Thanks. 

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000
You brought a lot of people this year. 

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.000
Our family is having a big event.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000
It's Tian's wedding.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000
So I brought everyone to pay respects to the Buddha

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
to bless for smooth wedding.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Congratulations to Mr. Tian for your wedding. 

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Are you going to have grandchild for Mr. Song after marriage?

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
It must be like that.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000
What are you waiting for?

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Right?

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Tian.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Your face wasn't quite good then. 

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Are you sick?

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
I'm just tired. It's been a long journey.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I thought there was something uncomfortable for you.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Time flies, Tian.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.000
I still remembers this feeling very well.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
I still remember the picture when you were a child.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000
You two brothers running and playing around. 

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
You are getting married soon.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:37.000
You're growing up to be an adult to take care of Song Family

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
and continue the work after me.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Father.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Actually, I still enjoy my work.

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.000
No need to get married now. 

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.000
Are you having a hard time?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:00.000
In the past, I've never discussed directly with you.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.000
I've always talked through your mom. 

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000
If you have any trouble, 

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
you can tell me. 

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000
I'm your father anyway.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I'm ready to do everything

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
to make you happy, Tian.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000
You're not in love with Pin, right?

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Is she not good?

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Or do you already have a lover?

00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.000
No, I don't. 

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Tian.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Since you were child, 

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.000
you were a good,

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000
hard-working boy.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.000
When you grow up, you have done a good job.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
The employees all love you.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
I saw you growing up every day.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:09.000
But it seems like it's me

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
who is far from you day by day. 

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000
I still remember well when you were a child, 

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
when you saw something, 

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000
you would always tell me about it.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
But now it's changed. 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.000
You never told me anything again.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Maybe it's because I am busy working.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Is it too late?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
If today…

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.000
If I want to know about you. 

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
What do you want to know?

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Everything.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Or a secret that everyone is talking about.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
You can tell me that too. 

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Father.

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Tian.

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.000
What are you guys talking? 

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
It's nothing. 

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
We were talking father and son stuff.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
If we wait here and don't meet Doctor Qi, 

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.000
what should we do?

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:10.000
Should we search for him?

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:14.000
I think if we rush out to look for him, we could miss him.

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.000
We also don't know which part of Chonburi Doctor Qi lives in. 

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Someone is here. 

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.000
Excuse me, can I ask you something?

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Do you know someone named Doctor Qi?

00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.000
He is a doctor who is good at Chinese herbal medicine.

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:32.000
He lives in Chonburi.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.000
Oh, there are many herbal medicine doctor here.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000
I can't remember all the names.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I’ll ask others and tell you later if someone know him.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.000
Thank you so much. 

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
As a leader of Song Family, 

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.000
I'd like to be a representative to pay respect to the Buddha.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000
A representative

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
to pay homage to all the gods that are here, 

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000
including all the ancestors of the Song Family.

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Please help protect

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.000
everyone in our family, 

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000
workers and servants.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:42.000
I wish everyone happiness and prosperity.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
May the business continue to prosper.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Who is Mr. Song's eldest son?

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Mr. Yang and Mr. Tian sleep in the same room.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:16.000
And how are we going to lure him out and let Mr. Ma's man attack him?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Has Mr. Ma's guy arrived yet?

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
(Whistling sound)

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
He's here.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Mr. Ma said that if the person is here, 

00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.000
he'll send a signal as a bird chirping to let us know. 

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Find time to deliver the news.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Tonight, I'm going to lure Tian to the garden

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
and let that person kill him. 

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Don't turn around, just tell me the plan.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:16.000
Tonight, go to Guanyin and then kill the man who are there.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Mr. Yang, 

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
we have a big trouble.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Mr. Yang, Madam Chan said she wanted to go to the monkhood. 

00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.000
What? Monkhood?

00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.000
Yes. 

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Mother.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Are you going to be ordained?

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
I went to talk to the monk teacher.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Telling him that I wanted you to be become as the clan leader.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.000
But I can't

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
because…

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:18.000
the position belongs to Tian.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000
So the teacher told me that I should know how to let go.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Otherwise, my heart will suffer.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Now I realize that I was wrong. 

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:33.000
So I want to get ordained

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000
in order to pay for my past mistakes.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Someone like you are going to get ordained?

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Yang, can you call Tian for me?

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
I have a lot of things that I want to talk to him. 

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I want to apologize.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
I want to ask for forgiveness,

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
so that I can follow the path of Dharma with peace of mind.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Aunt Chan.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Tian.

00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:32.000
Yang said that you have something to talk to me.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
I don't know how I can say this feeling.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000
In the past, what I did to you was wrong.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
I always nitpick. 

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Slandering Tian and Madam Li. 

00:25:48.500 --> 00:26:50.000
Please don't be mad at me.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Yes. 
315
00:26:53,000 --&gt; 00:25:58,000
I just realized after talking to the teacher.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
She said that she would be ordained.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000
Really?

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
Right. 

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
I feel guilty.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000
When I think of something serious I did to you, 

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
I am even more shocked.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Tian.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:28.000
In the past, when I did something,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
I did as I want

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
regardless of the rights or wrongs.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.000
The more I think about it, the more I regret it.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Tian, I'm very angry at myself.

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
I've been wrong for half my life.

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:45.000
I'm really sorry, I was wrong.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.000
I was wrong, I'm really sorry.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.400
Aunt Chan, it's okay. 

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
I felt so frustrated that I feel like I am suffocating.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000
I need to take the medicine first.

00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.000
Wait for me right here.

00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.000
Calm down.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.000
Yang, take me take medicine. I can't take it anymore.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Wait here for me, I'll be right back. Please. 

00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.000
Okay. 

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Mom, slowly. 

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Slowly.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Mother.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Just sit down and wait here.

00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.000
I'll go to the doctor or Aunt Jia to let them check your condition.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.000
No need to. 

00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.000
Are you better now?

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Not quite yet.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
But I'll probably get better after I sit here for a while.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
You don't have to call someone here. 

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
Just find something to fan me. 

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Ngek. / Yes?

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:39.000
Did you see Tian?

00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.000
I saw him in the garden.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000
It's late at night already. What is he doing in the garden?

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Mom. 

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.000
If you get better now, I'll see Tian.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.000
It's windy outside.

00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.000
No!

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Why?

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000
Are you pretending to be sick?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
What are you going to do?

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Who are you?

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Tian.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Tian. 

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Tian. 

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Mother...

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Tian. 

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Tian. 

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Tian. 

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Tian. 

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Blood. What happened to you?

00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.000
What's wrong? What's going on?

00:32:13.300 --> 00:32:14.000
Someone attacked me. 

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.000
I almost killed you, Tian. 

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Just a little bit. 

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
It's done.

00:32:57.500 --> 00:32:59.000
Are you in a lot of pain?

00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:02.000
It’s okay, Bua. Thank you very much.

00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:03.000
Yes. 

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
I let the workers go after him, but there was no sign of anything.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:14.000
I will set up a guard team tonight

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.000
in case the villain comes back.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:17.000
Tian. 

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Do you know who it is?

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.000
No, Father. 

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:26.000
It was very dark in that area. 

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
So why don't you sleep since it's late night?

00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.000
Why did you go to the garden?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
I went for a walk.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
The person who attacked me must be a bandit around here.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.000
He probably planned to rob an outsider like us for money.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Really?

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:53.000
Yes, Father. 

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.000
Bao.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
When you went out to find the villain, 

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000
was there anything wrong?

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Not at all, Sir. 

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.000
There was no trace inside the shrine. 

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Everything is fine. 

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
But Mr. Tian said that when the thief arrived, 

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
he just caught the thief first. I don't think it was right.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Because where Mr. Tian was attacked was an open space.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:42.266
If they didn’t plan to face each other, there's probably no easy way to meet.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
I also thought that it wasn't a thief.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000
And that Tian was attacked like this,

00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:57.000
it's probably related to his secret.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000
Why did you do this?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Did you call the thief to come here?

00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.000
It's not me. 

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.000
Are you saying that everything that happened was a coincidence?

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:14.000
You said you were remorseful and wanted to be ordained.

00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:16.000
You let me call Tian for you. I did it. 

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.000
What has gotten into you?

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:21.000
Why do you only think of hurting Tian?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:24.000
And did you see it just now?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
He didn't mention anything about us.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
If he said we were the ones who took him out, 

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.000
we might be kicked out of the family right away. 

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000
But he didn't.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Have you seen his goodness?

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
What does it have to do with me?

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:43.000
No matter how good he is, 

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
he's the one who are going to take everything from you.

00:35:46.300 --> 00:35:47.000
So what should I do?

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:51.000
I'm trying to figure out and expose his secret, 

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.000
but it was unsuccessful.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
If you don't want me to hurt him again, 

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
tell me what's the secret.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000
Tian.

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.000
How come you were there?

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Were Chan and Yang involved in this?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000
I told you already that I went for a walk. 

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Hey, don't think I can't see that you are hiding something. 

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000
If this Chan was involved, I won't be surprised.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000
But if it was Yang as well, you have to tell me. 

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Don't worry, Mother. 

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.000
Yang will never hurt me. 

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Don't be too confident about it.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Even the brothers from the same mother, they could kill each other.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.000
No matter how much they love each other, 

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000
if there are interests, 

00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:52.000
they're always ready to hate each other. 

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000
What is his secret?

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Tell me!

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000
I won't. 

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
Even if I die, I won't tell you.

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.000
Yang!

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Oh, Tian.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Aren't you going to bed yet? What are you doing here?

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
If the thief comes back, what will you do?

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000
He probably won't come back.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000
The lights are on. 

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Right. 

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:18.000
So what are you thinking?

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000
What exactly happened?

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
When I fixed your wound, 

00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:28.000
I saw that both you and Yang acted strange.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000
Bua. 

00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:38.000
Yes?

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Actually, I didn't go for a walk.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:46.000
Yang was the one who took me there. 

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Mother can see that the people who did this were Aunt Chan

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
and Yang.

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000
I don't know if it was a coincidence

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000
or if Aunt Chan intentionally let it be like this.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000
So...

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Tian… Did you have doubts about Yang?

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Not at all.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:13.000
I believe that no matter what happens, 

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Yang will never hurt me. 

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000
I never doubt anything about him.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Yes. 

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.000
What? Did Tian get away?

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.000
And did he see your face?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000
No. 

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.000
How could you miss it?

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
You usually never miss. 

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:51.000
But what's going on between you and him?

00:39:51.400 --> 00:39:53.000
Why did you want me to kill him?

00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.000
He seems to be a nice guy.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Do you know him?

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
No. 

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
According to his face, he seems harmless.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.000
He's harmless to you, but not me.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000
He interfered in my business and gave me a hard time. 

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:20.000
It's ok. You go back and rest now. 

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
I'll contact you later. 

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.000
I won't do this job anymore. 

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Why?

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000
It's too dangerous.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
The man you want me to kill has money and power.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:36.000
I don't want to risk my life. 

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000
You have to do it. 

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Did you forget

00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.000
that your sister's condition has improved

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000
because of the medicine I gave you.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:47.000
You choose. 

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:53.000
If he's not dead, your sister will.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Zhang Zhitian

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000
I looked around the shrine and couldn't find you.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000
I thought that you would come to see Mr. Zhang here.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
I miss Zhang. 

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Since he passed away, 

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000
The Five Dragons Association was never the same.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
If Mr. Zhang was still alive, 

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:14.000
he would be your consultant and could handle the chaos on behalf of you.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
He was the younger brother that I loved. 

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
He was the person who understood my feelings the most.

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Zhang is good,

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000
hard-working, 

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:44.000
and considerate.

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Whatever work I let him do, he always did well.

00:42:53.300 --> 00:42:55.000
Never failed at all. 

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
But he shouldn't be a homosexual.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:09.000
All the goodness

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000
that Zhang did

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.000
couldn't make you overlook this?

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:20.000
If he could choose, 

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:25.000
he himself would want you to understand.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
and accept what he was. 

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000
It already happened.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000
I couldn't fix anything.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
And if you could turn back time?

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:47.000
If you could go back, 

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000
would you still

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
drive him out of the Five Dragons Associations?

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000
I will have to make the same decision.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
No one accepts a homosexual

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:18.000
to manage and control people.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.000
I've made up my mind.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:47.000
I will stay here further. 

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:50.000
Is it alright? Will Mr. Song have any doubts?

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:54.000
I will tell Father that I would like to play around a little more.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.000
He probably wouldn't mind.

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Since we've been here, I don't want to come here in vain. 

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Because if we go back, we will never know

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:05.000
where we can find out about this mushroom.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Yes, let's do this. 

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:12.000
That is...

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
What is it?

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Mr. Song. 

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000
I thought we'd never meet again, Doctor Qi.

00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Doctor Qi.

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000
The people at the market have talked 

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
that people from the Song Family came to this shrine.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:41.000
So I thought that you come here to pay homage to the gods every year.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
But I was so busy that I couldn't rush here.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000
I need to treat the sick urgently. 

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
I thought that we would miss each other again.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Mr. Song, Madam Li, how are you?

00:45:56.500 --> 00:45:59.000
I am sick once in a while, like an old man.

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:03.000
But Jia has provided me treatment.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
I'm fine.

00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:10.000
I let Bao call Jia for you. She would be happy to meet you. 

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:14.000
How about you, Madam Chan?

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Good too. 

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Bua?

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Yes. 

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.000
These two must be Mr. Tian and Mr. Yang.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.000
But I can't remember which one is Tian or Yang since I saw you when you were little.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.000
The one on the right is Tian.

00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.000
The one on the left is Yang.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:48.000
These two have grown up and look handsome like you when you were young, Sir. 

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Everything is packed. Are you going back now?

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000
It's really a pity that I'm a bit late.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Not late at all, Doctor.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000
We still have time.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Let's have some tea.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Thank you so much Doctor Qi for taking such good care of us.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Mr. Song, Madam Li, Madam Chan, take care of your health.

00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.000
Have a safe trip back. 

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Mr. Yang.

00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:36.000
Let's go. 

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Doctor Qi.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Oh, Bua.

00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000
I would like to discuss with you.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
This is…

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:05.000
Do you know this mushroom?

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:09.000
What mushroom is it, Doctor?

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000
Why do you look so shocked?

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000
This mushroom is called

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000
blood sucking mushroom.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.000
Blood sucking mushroom?

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Why is the name so scary?

00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.000
And it's very rare, isn't it?

00:48:26.800 --> 00:48:31.000
Bua and I went to the drugstores and no one knows it.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000
It does not appear naturally.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:39.000
This mushroom is secret knowledge. 

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Secret knowledge?

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000
This is taking mushrooms that grow on insects

00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:50.000
or we called them orchids, 

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:53.000
put together with some special ingredients.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Just put the thing you want it to grow on in. 

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.000
As far as I see, 

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000
this mushroom grew from the remains of living things.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Remains of living things?

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Could you check what remains this mushroom grew on?

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Only those who made it will know.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Where did you two get this mushroom from?

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
At the backyard of Song's house.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000
You are here. 

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Jia. 

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.000
So glad to see you. How are you?

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:08.000
Do you have any difficulty living here?

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Not at all.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000
You know that an old man like me was not someone who wanted any comfort.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Otherwise I wouldn't have come out of the family. 

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000
I know, I remember it. 

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000
You told me that you would use your knowledge of medicine and herbs to help a lot of people.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Thinking about that time, if you didn't save me, 

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:39.000
I was probably dead.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:46.000
You didn't just save my life, but also gave me a new life.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:53.000
You taught me until I have knowledge of medicines to save people.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
And what I taught you, 

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Are you using it in the right way?

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Is it correct?

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Yes. 

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
If so, 

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000
this mushroom…

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:19.000
How did this mushroom appear in the back of the Song's house?

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000
What are you doing?

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
I didn't do anything.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:33.000
These mushrooms probably grew from the ants that took the orchids that I kept and eat at its nest.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000
So the mushrooms grew out there. 

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Really?

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
And who shows you this mushroom?

00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000
If this mushroom actually grew in the ant nest like you said, 

00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:51.000
you don't have to worry about who gave it to me. 

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Strange thing? There is strange thing. 

00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000
What's the matter, Sir?

00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:07.000
Dong, a worker at my house has died.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
His body disappeared.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000
The whole family suspected that it was Li who did it. 

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:18.000
So what do you think?

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:21.000
I suspect

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000
that it was Li too. 

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:30.000
But I am surprised. Why did she do it?

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000
What reason she has?

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000
There were mushrooms like this producing at your house, right?

00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.000
Yes, Doctor. 

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.000
How do you have this mushroom?

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.000
Try digging the area where this mushroom grew

00:52:47.400 --> 00:52:49.000
and see if there is anything there. 

00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.000
Tell me immediately if you find something.

00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:56.000
If I have finished my errands here, I will meet you in Phra Nakhon.

00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000
Someone has been investigating the mushrooms from Dong's body?

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
How did you answer Doctor Qi?

00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:07.000
I made up an excuse, but I didn't think he would believe it.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
What shall we do?

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Who is investigating this?

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:18.000
So how do we know?

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
So tired.

00:53:50.300 --> 00:53:53.000
Hey, you were so happy when you went there, weren't you. Hurry.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:37.000
It's good to go to Chonburi this time. We have met Doctor Qi.

00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.000
He is still the same.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:42.000
And...

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
What did you talk to him for a long time?

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
What's wrong? 

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000
Why are you looking at me like that?

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Nothing.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.000
We talked like the old men

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
with deteriorating health.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000
You aren't old yet. You're still young.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Among all my three wives, 

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Bua is the most lovable wife

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.000
because she is humble and never asked for anything.

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Chan is the most worried

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.000
because she likes to cause trouble

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.000
and won't surrender to anyone.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000
As for you, 

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000
you are the most respectful wife

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.000
because you are good

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:10.000
and talented. 

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.000
You can help me do my job.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
You know my heart.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:25.000
You are also the madam of the Song family. 

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000
Thank you, Sir. 

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000
Even Homer sometimes nods.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.000
The wise man can make a mistake sometimes. 

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
No matter how good you are, 

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.000
there is still a mistake.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:00.000
Do you have anything to tell me?

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:13.000
There's nothing, Sir. 

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Mr. Song. 

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Are you alright? Why are you asking me this?

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Sir. 

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:26.000
If you have something, 

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
you can ask me directly.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
You talk like this, 

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:36.000
I'm not feeling well at all.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:42.000
That's fine if you don't have anything to tell me.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Please know that

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000
I understand you.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:53.000
I don't want you to be stressed.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Recently, Mr. Song talks strangely.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:33.000
Did he say anything to you?

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000
No, Madam. 

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000
What's wrong?

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
I got a bad feeling. 

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.000
About Dong's body at the back of the house.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000
You can be at ease.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000
My fermented water is fatal.

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
It can eat into human bones

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:02.000
without traces left.

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Nothing is buried here, Sir. 

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000
These days, I can't sleep tight at all.

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000
The only way to end everything is

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000
to hurry and let Tian take the position.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Are you sure

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:45.000
that the workers picked mushrooms from here?

00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:47.000
It must be here, Sir. 

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Then there must be something. 

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000
A human tooth.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Whose teeth would drop here?

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.000
Or...

01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Is there a corpse buried here, Sir?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
If there is really a corpse here, 

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:39.000
then why is there only one tooth left?

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
How did your man work?

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:58.000
Instead of killing Tian, I almost got into trouble as well. 

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000
If you did everything according to the plan, 

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
my subordinate would have more time to handle this. 

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
What Mr. Ma said was correct, Madam. 

01:01:08.100 --> 01:01:09.000
Nuan! / Yes, Madam.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
How much time will it take just stabbing with a knife?

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:16.000
I think instead of fighting, 

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000
we should figure out a way to get rid of Tian. Isn't it better?

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000
It must be difficult.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
He was almost assassinated like this. He would probably be more careful.

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Previously, you said that

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000
Tian has a serious secret.

01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.000
Even Li had to kill a guy to cover up. 

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:47.000
What if we uncover this secret?

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000
I've been trying to search for that secret for a long time, 

01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:54.000
but it is still unsuccessful. 

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Right. 

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.000
The more they cover up, 

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
The more it is important.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
What is the secret of the Song Family's number one heir?

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.000
I would like to know that. 

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:15.000
So while you are planning to assassinate Tian, 

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000
I will find out this secret.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
What do you think?

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Good.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Jiu. 

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Fu, Mei.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Is anyone there?

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:39.000
I'm hurt. 

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.000
Mei.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Mei.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:43.000
I'm hurt.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Move. 

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Mei.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Eat this. 

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Jiu, there's no Mei's medicine left. 

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:17.000
I think Mei's condition is serious. You should take her to the doctor.

01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.000
I have taken her there. 

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000
The doctor said that there was no medicine to cure her. 

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Besides, it's a war time. 

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:26.000
There is no western medicine as well. 

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Now I'm just relying on Chinese medicine from someone I know.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.000
How long have you been treating her?

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.000
Isn't she better?

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Her condition improved only after taking the pills.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:43.000
But when the medicine wears off, the symptoms relapsed.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000
So what do you do next?

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Are you going to let Mei be like this?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
I won't do this job anymore. 

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
You have to do it. 

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Did you forget

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.000
that your sister's condition has improved

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000
because of the medicine I gave you.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000
You choose. 

01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000
If he's not dead, your sister will.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000
I think you should go back today.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
I'll send you off. 

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000
Let's go. 

01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Why did you bring me here today?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:12.000
It's a shortcut. 

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
I've never used this way before.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Even though it's a bit deserted, it's pleasant. 

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.000
There are a lot of trees.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Do you think so?

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Jiu. 

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Is there anything wrong?

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Nothing.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
Tian, dodge!

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Go along this way. You'll reach your home.

01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:45.000
Hurry, go!

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Go, Tian. Quickly!

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Gui. 

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Yeah, it's me. 

01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:01.000
You are evil. Dare to lie to Mr. Ma.

01:07:01.300 --> 01:07:02.000
How can you do this?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000
Mr. Ma. 

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000
What's up?

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
I came to look for you. You have been missing for a long time.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Sir. 

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
He knows Tian.

01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Just now, I went to shoot Tian, but Jiu saved him, so I missed it.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Otherwise, Tian would already be dead by now. 

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Jerk.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
Hey Gui, calm down. 

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Don't be impulsive.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000
If Tian dies in our territory, 

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Big Brother must suspect us. 

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000
You can let me kill anyone, 

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
but not this one, I beg you.

01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:09.000
So this means you are really close to Tian?

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000
He once helped my siblings.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:16.000
He is like a benefactor for my siblings just like you.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:19.000
Bastard, how dare you compare him to Mr. Ma?

01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Do you want your sister to die?

01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I understand you.

01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:31.000
A person must know gratitude.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
I don't want you to be ungrateful.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:39.000
So I have choices for you.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
If those two kids are still with us, 

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:24.000
Jiu will do anything for us.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
Mr. Tian, someone wants to apply for a job.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:31.000
I found this tooth.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
We have to find out who knows about this mushroom.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Mr. Yang.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:42.000
Do you know that I love and trusts you?

01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:44.000
You won't leave me, right?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
I have to live in misery because of the secret.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
The secret that I am...
