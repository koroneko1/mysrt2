00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Do you want me dead?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.343
I've to do this because of you.. 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:55.937
The beginning of disappeared reflection

00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:02.810
Hello everyone, my name is Tang

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.306
My dream to be solo artist will come true soon

00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:10.583
being able to audition with music record is really what i have been waiting for

00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:14.189
I'll never let anything stand in my way.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.343
Okay guys, we shall start if you're ready.

00:01:40.691 --> 00:01:44.782
When our heart's asking

00:01:45.309 --> 00:01:48.501
when will the love come..?  

00:01:50.775 --> 00:01:55.180
I can't find out why

00:01:55.758 --> 00:01:58.461
like our hearts want it to be

00:02:00.746 --> 00:02:05.283
So i try searching for something I'm not sure of

00:02:05.883 --> 00:02:08.830
to understand

00:02:33.563 --> 00:02:37.564
Wow!! you're both pretty good.

00:02:38.198 --> 00:02:40.401
Umm.. but what's wrong with you today Tang?

00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:42.490
Why didn't you send the audition video in duet version? 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.443
Why the solo one?

00:02:44.443 --> 00:02:46.882
This dude can only do the basics.

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.932
Basics?? 

00:02:48.932 --> 00:02:52.146
I think May are almost like a pro right now

00:02:52.403 --> 00:02:53.656
 Thank you

00:02:53.784 --> 00:02:56.171
 But just a little comment for you, Tang

00:02:56.171 --> 00:02:58.503
I want you to make more "eye contact"

00:02:58.503 --> 00:03:01.963
 or you can practice it in front of the mirror

00:03:01.963 --> 00:03:06.000
 If you stay this way, I think it's not attractive though

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.504
 Or the easiest way..

00:03:07.504 --> 00:03:09.795
 just let May train you how to entertain

00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:13.227
 Uhh, but Tang's usually very good at this

00:03:13.553 --> 00:03:17.013
 Oh.. yes I think he a little tired today

00:03:17.013 --> 00:03:18.249
Is that so..

00:03:18.692 --> 00:03:21.703
 Or.. you have an insomnia? 

00:03:21.703 --> 00:03:24.624
I think you look a bit run-down today

00:03:24.624 --> 00:03:26.370
Okay okay, whatever

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.256
On the audition tomorrow, just do it like today

00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:32.227
 I will sent you the link

00:03:32.227 --> 00:03:35.823
 and there will be chief producer joining online too

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:39.325
 So.. Tang and May, please be well-prepared okay?

00:03:39.325 --> 00:03:41.083
 Ok.. ok

00:03:41.083 --> 00:03:42.913
And don't forget.

00:03:42.913 --> 00:03:44.554
Practice in front of the mirror more..  

00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:46.522
Also try to entertain the producer too okay?

00:03:47.232 --> 00:03:51.257
Okay? See you bye.

00:03:53.338 --> 00:03:57.023
 See! and you plan to let me play the cord

00:03:57.023 --> 00:03:58.609
 But got asked to be the duo

00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.029
I think I have a chance to be an pop-star.

00:04:02.029 --> 00:04:04.556
 but normally, did the artist like have to practice in front of the mirror? 

00:04:04.556 --> 00:04:06.000
 I just know that 

00:04:07.483 --> 00:04:10.166
Oh! Baimon.. Jack.. you guys come to rehearse?

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:14.019
 Yes, and hey.. isn't that P'Nep from Sky Records?

00:04:14.923 --> 00:04:18.043
 I heard both of you play and it was fantastic

00:04:18.043 --> 00:04:20.117
 It's like listen to the voice of god

00:04:21.574 --> 00:04:23.574
 Can we do back-up for your band then?

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:28.605
Woah.. so you guys would be my back-up?

00:04:28.605 --> 00:04:30.000
please don't be bothered.

00:04:30.286 --> 00:04:33.821
 No! there's no problem, we are more than ready to play for you!

00:04:34.403 --> 00:04:36.406
 I mean don't bother me, iterally. 

00:04:36.406 --> 00:04:38.758
It's quite disgusting for my audiences to see you both

00:04:38.887 --> 00:04:40.529
 Go make yourself look better

00:04:41.749 --> 00:04:43.071
 Tang.... / Tang what the fuck?

00:04:43.071 --> 00:04:43.819
 Why?

00:04:44.623 --> 00:04:49.036
 you want me to look at other's face right? here it's not that hard. 

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:59.243
 my friend are just foul-mouthed, don't mind him

00:04:59.243 --> 00:05:00.602
 Just keep fighting okay? 

00:05:00.602 --> 00:05:01.740
I know you guys are so good! 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.182
I can't wait to see you guys on the stage

00:05:12.512 --> 00:05:15.663
 Er.. Tang.. I think what P'Nep said is quite right.

00:05:15.663 --> 00:05:17.408
 when you perform, you seem.. 

00:05:17.408 --> 00:05:19.941
too focus on yourself, but not the audience

00:05:20.223 --> 00:05:24.000
Why don't you try practicing in front of the mirror like P'Nep said?

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.935
 Why are you guys so serious?? 

00:05:25.935 --> 00:05:27.863
It's gonna be an online audition..

00:05:27.863 --> 00:05:30.503
 I just have to look into the camera, not the judges

00:05:30.503 --> 00:05:32.132
 That's it. 

00:05:32.683 --> 00:05:34.683
Just ask you to practice in the mirror..

00:05:34.743 --> 00:05:36.780
Instead, you gonna be a couch potato now? 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.141
 What the heck is wrong with you guys?

00:05:39.141 --> 00:05:42.999
 why? so you got some compliment then you gonna brag it on me?

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.013
What the..

00:05:45.013 --> 00:05:48.541
 Hey.. Tang where are you going?

00:05:48.541 --> 00:05:51.251
Duh.. why so serious? I'm just playing around

00:05:51.251 --> 00:05:54.429
 that's too much! / but i'm just joking

00:05:56.143 --> 00:05:59.777
 How did the facial and acne treatment go?

00:06:03.483 --> 00:06:05.803
 Actually, your face looks really brighter.

00:06:05.803 --> 00:06:07.863
 So much better than the last time 

00:06:07.863 --> 00:06:11.260
 But I think get a less sleep lately

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.819
Someone said that me face look a bit run down 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:14.339
..so I'm not very confident about it

00:06:14.339 --> 00:06:16.537
 Okay I got you, let's go up stairs to do the acne treatment 

00:06:16.537 --> 00:06:18.537
Also the bio-light acne clean okay?

00:06:58.643 --> 00:07:02.612
 Just practice it in front of the mirror please Tang?

00:08:18.738 --> 00:08:20.257
 I didn't do it

00:08:21.739 --> 00:08:23.739
 I didn't kill P'Fei 

00:08:39.285 --> 00:08:40.022
Tang : Do you see me reflection?

00:08:40.022 --> 00:08:41.540
Tang : Do you see me reflection?
May : Wanna show us that you're practicing?

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.540
May : Lol wanna show us that you're practicing?
Nam-mei : That's my boy!

00:09:08.063 --> 00:09:10.523
 Hey guys look!

00:09:10.523 --> 00:09:11.429
 What????

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.422
 I really can't see myself

00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.404
Hmm?

00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:16.678
 I see you, normally 

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.287
No! hey look

00:09:20.141 --> 00:09:21.584
Oh! 

00:09:21.584 --> 00:09:22.769
There's nothing but your face, normally

00:09:22.769 --> 00:09:23.269
Right? 

00:09:23.816 --> 00:09:25.822
 What's wrong with you man

00:09:27.315 --> 00:09:28.808
Wait..

00:09:28.808 --> 00:09:30.221
Your hair..

00:09:30.221 --> 00:09:32.163
What've you done to your hair? / Haha

00:09:32.163 --> 00:09:35.763
 Really mess up, come sit here I'll brush for you

00:09:35.763 --> 00:09:37.728
 Are you run to here? 

00:09:37.728 --> 00:09:38.942
Nah, I don't think it's running. 

00:09:38.942 --> 00:09:41.203
He must be gone to the wild? or the war?

00:09:41.203 --> 00:09:44.803
Hey dude, I'm serious I can't see my reflection

00:09:44.803 --> 00:09:46.656
I think it's clear now / What? 

00:09:46.656 --> 00:09:48.656
This dude has a artist phobia

00:09:48.863 --> 00:09:53.040
So he's going to be the artist right? Then, he has to have a weird phobia for gimmick

00:09:53.263 --> 00:09:54.000
I get it!

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.803
I've seen some celebrity afraid of orange.. tomato.. sth like that. 

00:09:57.004 --> 00:09:59.368
 But you're so chic!

00:09:59.368 --> 00:10:00.676
 I'm in serious

00:10:01.631 --> 00:10:03.391
 Ok i believe you now.

00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:06.913
But don't you want to say that even if you can't see yourself you still think you look handsome?

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:09.239
 No, it's not what you think

00:10:09.619 --> 00:10:10.246
Done!

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:11.279
Well..

00:10:11.483 --> 00:10:15.303
Will May help Tang out in the evening as usual?

00:10:15.303 --> 00:10:19.010
 Ok..the song will remain the same then? / Ok

00:10:19.437 --> 00:10:20.943
 Please go hard on your rehearsal 

00:10:20.943 --> 00:10:23.089
 Be ready

00:10:55.425 --> 00:10:57.631
 Damn, don't you look at yourself in the mirror? 

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:05.501
 Are you ready..the link is here!

00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:08.101
 Did she sent the link?

00:11:11.868 --> 00:11:12.503
 Do your best!

00:11:14.603 --> 00:11:20.363
Hi everyone from SKY record, I'm Tang and I'm 17 yo

00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:22.349
I'm from Saint August in Chiang mai 

00:11:23.124 --> 00:11:25.124
 ..and this is my friend, May

00:11:25.124 --> 00:11:26.806
he will play the second guitar

00:11:28.614 --> 00:11:33.650
 Hi, I am P'Job. If you guys ready then we can start now

00:11:47.063 --> 00:11:49.803
 Maybe it's just the wind slowly blowing through 

00:11:52.829 --> 00:11:56.329
It might be the floating cloud in the sky

00:12:00.323 --> 00:12:07.063
but how would it be to wait for love to come

00:12:13.271 --> 00:12:17.876
 Like a lost person among the crowd

00:12:19.595 --> 00:12:23.095
 It may just come and be gone in just a second we walk pass

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.500
Someone who I look into the eye

00:12:31.629 --> 00:12:33.466
Today might be exciting for you

00:12:33.466 --> 00:12:37.613
I might need to leave now. Thanks so much for being with us today.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.285
 What happen today?

00:12:43.285 --> 00:12:48.251
 I think your performance drops off a bit

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:49.697
I'm really sorry 

00:12:49.823 --> 00:12:52.343
 Umm.. I think it's because of the online audition.. 

00:12:52.343 --> 00:12:54.188
 It was May who changed the beat and didn't tell me 

00:12:55.017 --> 00:12:57.017
 I told you he can only do the basics

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.813
What the fuck Tang?

00:12:59.244 --> 00:13:00.309
Is that so?

00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:03.640
 It's gonna be ashamed if that's so.. 

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.459
Okay okay

00:13:05.459 --> 00:13:09.383
 Thanks both of you for today

00:13:09.383 --> 00:13:13.141
 Until we meet again

00:13:13.643 --> 00:13:15.671
 But I haven't show you another song yet

00:13:16.123 --> 00:13:21.364
Umm you can upload the video on youtube, and send me the link then

00:13:22.841 --> 00:13:24.546
 Ok 

00:13:24.546 --> 00:13:25.924
 Thank you 

00:13:25.924 --> 00:13:27.772
See you then

00:13:27.772 --> 00:13:29.134
See ya

00:13:34.166 --> 00:13:37.000
 Tang give me some explantations now!!

00:13:37.622 --> 00:13:39.622
 What the fuck is wrong with you

00:13:39.983 --> 00:13:44.043
You said I changed the beat, but actually you just interrupt me 

00:13:44.043 --> 00:13:45.601
 I just answer it randomly.

00:13:45.601 --> 00:13:47.601
 Don't be so silly

00:13:47.601 --> 00:13:50.153
 Randomly? Random my ass! 

00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:52.563
WTF? This is since you told them about the composer of the song 

00:13:52.563 --> 00:13:56.063
I let you take all the credit to yourself

00:13:57.093 --> 00:14:00.783
Only chord without lyrics.. do you want to play Classic?

00:14:00.783 --> 00:14:02.269
Did you think before you say that?

00:14:02.269 --> 00:14:04.357
Hey!! Calm down, let's not have a fight!

00:14:05.763 --> 00:14:10.203
 Nam-mei!! I already told you right? He's a jerk and can not change! 

00:14:10.354 --> 00:14:11.734
 That's why you don't have any friends left

00:14:12.412 --> 00:14:13.734
 You are such a foul-mouthed

00:14:13.743 --> 00:14:16.610
Hey!! calm down and listen to me

00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:20.402
So the first song, you wrote the cords, and you wrote the lyrics right?

00:14:20.402 --> 00:14:22.023
This song's credit is for you both. 

00:14:22.023 --> 00:14:25.136
 Then.. why do you guys have to fight?

00:14:25.136 --> 00:14:26.743
 you guys said you would help me out on the audition

00:14:26.743 --> 00:14:29.184
 Why did you ruin "my" show

00:14:29.184 --> 00:14:32.763
Huh!! "your" stupid show I don't want any of it

00:14:32.763 --> 00:14:35.903
 I helped you a lot and you aren't even grateful!

00:14:35.903 --> 00:14:37.617
It's because I couldn't see my reflect!

00:14:37.617 --> 00:14:39.617
Please calm down!! /  you are still as disgusting as you used to be 

00:14:40.370 --> 00:14:41.617
Tang!!!!!

00:14:43.593 --> 00:14:45.966
Whatever! I'm done with you!

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.532
Tang.. please go talk to May..

00:15:32.003 --> 00:15:36.936
I just need it for my protection..

00:15:37.062 --> 00:15:40.469
I want the magazine gun just like the pic I sent.

00:15:41.248 --> 00:15:42.501
in two days?

00:15:44.183 --> 00:15:46.355
As the location I sent you
