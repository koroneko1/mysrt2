There's another dead person?

Well, he's been hanging around the building lately.

I did think it was odd.

(soft chuckles)

136
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:45,316
DETECTIVE PARK: They say the eye patch man

137
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,569
has been roaming around the company these past few days.

138
00:08:50,154 --> 00:08:51,322
There were company employees

139
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,824
who testified that he's been stalking the deceased Lee Sunhee.

140
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,999
DETECTIVE CHOI: Why was he following Lee Sunhee around?

141
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,501
(Detective Park inhales sharply)

142
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,086
DETECTIVE PARK: But if the eye patch man

143
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:06,963
killed Hwang Myeonghun and Lee Sunhee,

144
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,758
then the timeline doesn't make sense if you take a look at this.

145
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,970
Because the eye patch man entered this building

146
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:18,391
after Hwang Myeonghun fell from the rooftop and died.

147
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,648
What about that woman who helped him?

148
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,067
-Please show us the entrance gate footage. -Yes, sir.

149
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,279
DETECTIVE PARK: Apparently, she entered a few minutes

150
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,073
-after the eye patch man entered. -Ah...

151
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,826
DETECTIVE PARK: This woman took the employee badge

152
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,413
from the bathroom outside the gate over there.

153
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:49,505
DONGSOO: Wherever you are, I'll find you and come after you!

(sighs)

155
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,801
But how?

156
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,433
(sighs)

157
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:09,442
(sighs deeply)

158
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,446
(ominous music)

159
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,667
The transplant?

160
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,924
(sighs) This does not make sense.

161
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,472
And yet it does.

162
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,183
(chuckles slightly)

163
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,484
-Excuse me. -JINSEOP: Yes.

164
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:55,655
-Are you Team Leader Oh Jinseop? -Yes.

165
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:56,906
Uh...

Do you have time to answer a few questions?

168
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:10,795
Yes.

169
00:11:11,796 --> 00:11:12,880
Okay.

170
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,132
(grunts lightly)

171
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:18,386
DETECTIVE CHOI: By any chance, do you recognize this man?

172
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:19,720
Yes.

173
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,018
He made that much ruckus,

174
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,770
so it'd be weird if I didn't recognize him.

175
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,563
Ah...

176
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,068
Ah, I see. All right.

177
00:11:34,151 --> 00:11:36,237
Well, while we're on the topic...

178
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:41,867
while he was causing that ruckus, where were you watching from?

179
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,078
The hallway.

180
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,748
What was he shouting while causing the ruckus?

181
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,253
He said thief, or something like that, I think.

182
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,295
Thief?

183
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:58,384
Did he shout "something" thief?

184
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,177
I'm not sure about the details...

185
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,304
I heard he said something like "eyeball thief."

186
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:06,434
What's the point of this?

187
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:09,145
Why would you ask when you already know?

188
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,231
Oh...

189
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:16,235
For now,

190
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,280
I do not know.

191
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:21,365
(ominous music)

192
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:28,289
I remember Sunhee telling Jiyoung that a man missing an eyeball

193
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:32,042
and wearing an eye patch was following her around.

194
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,839
If it's about that, you should ask her...

195
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,968
Ah, I just did check with her.

196
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:50,186
Ah, Mr. Oh, were you wearing a coat when you came to work this morning?

197
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,854
A coat?

198
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:57,526
Uh, I heard the eye patch man was looking for someone's coat.

199
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,822
-Could we take a look at your coat? -(sighs)

200
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:03,908
Uh, wait a minute.

201
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,578
What are you doing right now? Huh?

202
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:09,371
You should be catching the culprit,

203
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,041
but instead, you're asking silly questions to an innocent person!

204
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,376
You think you can do whatever you want just because you're cops?

205
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,629
-How could you say something like that? -I mean...

206
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,925
It's okay, Jiyoung.

207
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,427
The detectives should keep all possibilities

208
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:26,972
open in their investigation until they reach the conclusion.

209
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:32,812
I totally understand this little bit of disrespect.

210
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,067
Thank you for your understanding.

211
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,069
But, what I want to ask is...

212
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,362
Yes, what is it?

213
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,489
What is that tissue for?

214
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:46,992
Is it to lessen the anxiety on the subject you're interrogating?

215
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:52,289
Ah, this... this, ah, yes.

216
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:56,502
(chuckles awkwardly) I, uh, had a bit of nosebleed earlier.

217
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:58,337
Is it still bleeding?

218
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,256
(lightly chuckles)

219
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,240
(clears throat)

220
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,666
(ominous music)

221
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,480
Thanks.

222
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,652
(sniffles)

223
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,822
(slurps)

224
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,032
Now, tell me.

225
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,120
Who... Who are you?

226
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,372
I'm a novelist.

227
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:19,919
To be?

228
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,420
(lightly chuckles)

229
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,050
Well, even if I do become one, it might be over with just one novel.

230
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:31,180
I just wanted to write about Connect.

231
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,808
Why?

232
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,770
I received help from a Connect when I was young.

233
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,773
There was a kid who helped me

234
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:43,192
when I was about to get hit by a dump truck.

235
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,028
The kid got hit by the truck instead of me.

236
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,157
And that kid was a Connect.

237
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:54,912
(sniffles)

238
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,212
Was it a friend?

239
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,925
No, I had never seen the kid before.

240
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,597
The kid was crushed under the truck, and it was brutal.

241
00:16:14,932 --> 00:16:19,103
The truck driver was scared to death and didn't know what to do,

242
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:21,313
and then ran away.

243
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:28,028
But surprisingly,

244
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,783
the body of that kid,

245
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,877
was restored in the blink of an eye.

246
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:47,256
Just like you.

247
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:56,223
And then the kid just disappeared.

248
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:05,149
I didn't have time to say thanks, and no one believed me.

249
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,070
So, the incident wasn't reported at all, as if it never happened.

250
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,616
But I remember.

251
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,370
I remember that kid who cared to save me that day.

252
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:25,502
And then one day, I heard an urban legend about a body that does not die.

253
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:33,469
That's when I started digging.

254
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:41,685
What about you? Do you know who's after you?

255
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:48,650
Aren't they organ traffickers?

256
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,488
IRANG: That's right, but it looks like there's a higher organization

257
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,490
that actually does the organ trafficking,

258
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:57,576
and the ones after you are organ hunters, who specialize in capturing people.

259
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,537
So you were caught by them and you ran away from them?

260
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,581
(clatters)

261
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,587
DONGSOO: Yeah.

262
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:12,549
DOES ANYONE KNOW

263
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,718
AN URBAN LEGEND CALLED CONNECT?

264
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:17,888
ANYONE?

265
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:21,809
So, I left a reply comment there, and I was able to meet them.

266
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:23,602
This is what I wrote back then.

267
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,231
And then we agreed to exchange information,

268
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,733
but we had different motives so we just sounded each other out.

269
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,319
IRANG: But obviously, no real information came of it.

270
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,239
I was able to find various information,

271
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,826
through the tapping device I planted there.

272
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,369
Tapping device?

273
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,664
From you, a novelist?

274
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,709
Well, it is illegal, but...

275
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:50,504
they are criminals anyway.

276
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:54,007
Thanks to that, I learned about you.

277
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,221
(sighs deeply)

278
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:01,598
(inhaling) So...

279
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,559
What is this Connect?

280
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,020
(exhales deeply)

281
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,981
It's not a simple cut-and-dried story.

282
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,401
Based on the information I collected,

283
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:18,407
they're connected with Jeongdo Pharmaceuticals.

284
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,078
Jeongdo Pharmaceuticals? You mean...

285
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,622
Right, the number one corporation in our country.

286
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,543
What is that?

287
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,213
If you're concerned, do you want to investigate it together?

288
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:36,884
(sighing)

289
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:40,387
I am concerned, but stopping the murders is more important right now.

290
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:42,806
Murder?

291
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,353
When I was abducted,

292
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,861
I lost an eye. And that eye was transplanted to a man...

293
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,196
(sighs)

294
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:03,827
(sighs deeply)

295
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:08,123
That bastard has it.

296
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:10,334
My eye...

297
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,504
(laughs)

298
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,387
(inhales deeply)

299
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,014
Sorry.

300
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:27,559
But how do you know?

301
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,395
That his eye is yours?

302
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,900
(sighs lightly)

303
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,944
Because I had visions.

304
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:44,743
DETECTIVE CHOI: He's an unbelievable narcissist.

305
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,537
Oh Jinseop?

306
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:48,705
Yeah.

307
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,918
We were the ones attacking him,

308
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:56,004
yet he bared his teeth at the one who's trying to help him.

309
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,172
Huh?

310
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,675
When?

311
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,347
He seemed more annoyed with the woman

312
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,559
who defended him than us who were interrogating him.

313
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,981
He is triggered by completely different things

314
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,816
compared to ordinary people.

315
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,277
(ominous music)

316
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,370
IRANG: I've never heard of anything like that.

317
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,417
An ability to have vision even after having the eye transplanted to someone...

318
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,460
(sighs)

319
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,797
Well, it's up to you to believe it or not.

320
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,632
What else happens?

321
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,511
You know, thoughts being shared...

322
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:50,475
Well, it's not really something like that...

323
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:52,602
(Dongsoo sighs)

324
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,696
Ah...

325
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,455
(breathing shakily)

326
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,416
(light music)

327
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,346
Looks better than the eye patch.

328
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,264
(breathing shakily)

329
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,516
Everyone is looking for a man with an eye patch.

330
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,477
Keep that on whenever you go outside.

331
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:44,529
(clatters)

332
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,866
Would you like it in a bag?

333
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,577
-Ah... -Yes.

WANTED FLYER OF MURDER SUSPECT

335
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,175
I, uh, I'll just take it.

336
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,303
I rang up for the bag too...

337
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:11,348
Oh, please take this.

338
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,351
(breathing shakily)

339
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:18,063
Man, this is driving me crazy.

341
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:22,734
What's wrong?

342
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,196
(panting)

343
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:29,366
We're... connected.

Ah, wait.

(panting)

359
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:12,117
He's listening to my song. I think my eye is responding to my song.

360
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,202
What do you mean?

361
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,328
(groans)

362
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:18,165
Are you saying that your vision is linked when he listens to your song?

IRANG: Do you think he found out? That you've been watching?

371
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,279
DONGSOO: I don't know yet.

372
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,073
If he finds out,

373
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:54,659
he will come kill you.

374
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,502
Can he really kill me?

375
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:10,425
He could kill you through social media if he reveals your face

376
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,094
and your bodily secrets with a video on the internet.

377
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,557
(sighs)

378
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:20,268
Keep a low profile for a while, and let me do the probing.

379
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,396
Okay?

380
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,197

My goodness, what little savings I have

384
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:49,047
is all about to go into my wife's hospital bill.

385
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:53,176
This life of mine, seriously.

386
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,595
It's like living in hell.

387
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,723
There is nothing good. Oh, goodness.

388

389
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:06,189

(song continues)

407
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,381
Maybe there are good things in this hellish world sometimes.

408
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:19,346
Z (singing over radio): ♪ That is my sound... ♪

I guess so.

411
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,404
Wow, but it really sounds different when played by a professional musician.

419

Z: The thing is, we don't know anything about his identity either.

420
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,989
There's the royalty issue about lyrics

421
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,785
and the music so we really tried to look for him, but we couldn't find him.

422
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:28,248
I heard the copyright fee is going straight to donation. That is my sound.

423
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:34,796
Oh, that's a shame. I thought it would be a perfect fit for our advertisement.

424
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,339
(exhales deeply)

425
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:40,343
A big corporation is amazed by a nameless amateur.

426
00:28:40,427 --> 00:28:43,179
That's unbelievable, right?

427
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:47,100
I think that's why I'm so drawn to him, an artist who's not swayed by money.

428
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,270
I mean, it even makes me feel happy.

429
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:55,817

DETECTIVE PARK: So...

432
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:14,002
Why are you after the eye patch man?

433
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,797
I said I was just jogging.

434
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,968
For diet.

435
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,553
Enough of that bullshit.

436
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:29,058
What, someone like you who looks they loan out small amounts

437
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,311
and take huge interests?

438
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,395
(smirks)

439
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,939
Huh? Huh?

441
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,410
DETECTIVE CHOI (on speaker): You're still doing this?

442
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,579
Let him go.

443
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,498
DETECTIVE PARK: Detective.

444
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,166
DETECTIVE CHOI: Let him go.

445
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:56,586
THUG: Can I go?

446
00:29:57,587 --> 00:29:59,589
(Detective Park grunts)

447
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,009

448
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,428
DETECTIVE PARK: Go.

449
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:08,139
Go. And don't come back.

450
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,018
Get out!

451
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:17,899
DETECTIVE CHOI: Let's do this the easy way.

452
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,903
First, keep that eye patch man on a tight leash.

453
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,205
It's me, Woojin, sir.

454
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,292
MINSOOK (on tape): Why is it so difficult to get a hold of you?

455
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:41,089
You know how important that money is to us, right?

456
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:46,010
How about the guy with the transplanted eye, huh? Woojin?

457
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:48,221
"Woojin"?

458
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,765
(chuckles)

459
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,892
WOOJIN (on mobile phone): Yes, he's doing the regular 9 to 5

460
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,144
like a common office worker.

461
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:00,024
Yeah, okay, keep your eyes wide open and watch carefully, okay?

462
00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:07,699
Damn it, he was about to die any moment anyway,

463
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:10,910
so why did we transplant the eye to him, huh?

464
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:12,412
MINSOOK (on tapping device): Right?

465
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:16,249
It's an eye that can be sold for a high price,

466
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,210
so we should take it before he's cremated, right?

467
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:24,090
-He's dying? -MINSOOK: My pretties, where... huh?

468
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,383
What?

469
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:28,261
The... the baby is gone.

470
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,055
Both of them?

471
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,641
No, no, Sodom is here, but Gomorrah is missing.

472
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,685
Where did it go?

473
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:36,978
MR. KIM: Aw, come on...

474
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,731
MINSOOK: What are you doing? Find it!

475
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:43,860
Ah...

476
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,237
MINSOOK (mumbling): Damn it, where is it?

477
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,366
Huh?

478
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,118
MINSOOK (on tapping device): It's a tapping device.

479
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,119
MR. KIM (on tapping device): Who the fuck dared to...

480
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,537
Come on. (clicks tongue)

481
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,296
It's her, that novelist bitch.

482
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,926
She said she didn't have enough battery on her laptop and came over here.

483
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:08,927
May I plug in to charge here?

484
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:11,888
So she wasn't looking for source material to write a novel? That was a lie, too?

485
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:14,849
We should beat that bitch up first, right?

486
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,392
(exhales deeply)

487
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:22,649
Maybe she knows more about Connect than we do?

503
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:07,670
WILL DO. I WILL TURN THEM

504
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:09,130
INTO MINE. CLOSE YOUR EYES AND IMAGINE.

505
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,715
FALLEN ANGEL.

506
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:11,758
SEE ME.

507
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,884
AND SAY THAT I'M BEAUTIFUL.

508
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,094
WHY WAS I BORN INTO THIS WORLD? WHAT WAS I MEANT TO DO IN THIS WORLD?

509
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:19,849
HUBRIS, REASON ENOUGH TO BE ABANDONED.

(groans)

511
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,238
DONGSOO: He's sick with an illness?

512
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:38,034
Yeah, that's what they said.

513
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,037
That it wouldn't be surprising if he died any moment.

514
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,164
Then could that...

515
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,917
have a connection with the murders?

516
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,795
(inhales sharply) I heard your song.

517
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,630
It was nice.

518
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:53,925
Ah... (sniffs)

519
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:58,262
Oh, not the original, but Z's arranged version.

520
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,433
I guessed so, too.

521
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,894
(laughs) Just kidding.

522
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,979
(laughs, sniffles)

523
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,485
-What's wrong? -(groaning)

524
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:16,697
-You don't have to be so dramatic. -(groaning)

525
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,407
I said I was kidding.

526
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:22,745
(groaning)

527
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,253
I can see myself. (pants)

528
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,379
What?

529
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,803
Me? What? Why?

531
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:59,323

00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:03,244

DONGSOO (in shaky voice): That bastard...

534
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,583
That bastard is toying with me. That son of a bitch.

(breathing shakily)

539
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:58,341
