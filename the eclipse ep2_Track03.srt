4
00:00:17,907 --> 00:00:18,690
You, newbie.

5
00:00:20,662 --> 00:00:22,520
Why are you not wearing Suppalo’s school uniform?

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,756
I don’t want to.

7
00:00:23,872 --> 00:00:25,000
But you must.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,078
It's the rule.

9
00:00:26,336 --> 00:00:27,699
I’m a prefect.

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,480
My duty is to make everyone follow the rules.

11
00:00:30,878 --> 00:00:32,287
I followed the new kid.

12
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:33,884
He was acting so shady.

13
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,621
An old issue remains unsolved. A new issue arises.

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,720
You’ve been following me everywhere.

15
00:00:38,886 --> 00:00:40,296
Are you into me, prefect?

16
00:00:40,296 --> 00:00:41,308
Shameless,

17
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,147
what’s your goal?

18
00:00:53,965 --> 00:00:54,701
Kan,

19
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,632
do you really need so many stickers?

20
00:00:58,163 --> 00:00:59,585
Of course.

21
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:00,894
All right, then.

22
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:08,247
Honor the uniform, Kan.

23
00:01:08,857 --> 00:01:10,739
Why so many?

24
00:01:12,024 --> 00:01:15,320
This is from Praew, a drum major from Nisachon all-girls school.

25
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:20,424
This is from Alice, a volleyball player from Harrow International School.

26
00:01:21,158 --> 00:01:25,942
And the one right on my heart is from Khao Tu, the best student in the province.

27
00:01:26,635 --> 00:01:28,824
Wow! My friend is just so hot.

28
00:01:32,056 --> 00:01:32,924
And you?

29
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:35,173
Aren’t you going on a date with anyone this evening?

30
00:01:35,353 --> 00:01:37,919
I heard a girl sent you a present.

31
00:01:38,811 --> 00:01:40,000
I’m not going anywhere.

32
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:42,569
I’m a student. I came here to study.

33
00:01:42,982 --> 00:01:44,864
Other things are nonsense to me.

34
00:01:44,864 --> 00:01:45,799
How dare you!

35
00:01:46,557 --> 00:01:48,746
Are you saying I’m nonsense?

36
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:50,770
I am not.

37
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:56,065
Seriously, don’t you like anyone at all, Akk?

38
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:57,916
Right.

39
00:01:58,199 --> 00:01:59,259
Tell me.

40
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,269
Speak into the microphone here.

41
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:02,663
Speak.

42
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:10,272
Open your eyes and see.

43
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:12,760
We’re in an all-boys school.

44
00:02:13,432 --> 00:02:14,724
Who would I like?

45
00:02:14,724 --> 00:02:15,521
What?

46
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,213
Wat likes the security guard.

47
00:02:17,213 --> 00:02:18,016
Right.

48
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:18,684
What the heck?

49
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,212
No?

50
00:02:24,656 --> 00:02:26,329
You’ve been following me everywhere.

51
00:02:28,854 --> 00:02:30,618
Are you into me, prefect?

52
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:51,142
What does this statement of Juliet mean?

53
00:03:51,142 --> 00:03:53,407
“He will make the face of heaven so fine.”

54
00:03:53,407 --> 00:03:55,542
“That all the world will be in love with night.”

55
00:03:55,646 --> 00:03:58,047
“And pay no worship to the garish sun.”

56
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:02,312
It means Juliet is so drunk in love.

57
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:05,588
She thinks Romeo is her big love.

58
00:04:06,505 --> 00:04:07,654
Interesting, Thuaphu.

59
00:04:08,645 --> 00:04:09,496
Teacher,

60
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:13,621
have you got your own Romeo yet?

61
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,226
If not,

62
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:19,400
you can be drunk in love with me.

63
00:04:20,065 --> 00:04:24,160
Boo!

64
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,786
I’ve seen lots of terrific comedians end up in terrible tragedy, Kanlong.

65
00:04:39,853 --> 00:04:41,145
The time is up.

66
00:04:41,145 --> 00:04:43,581
We will continue Romeo & Juliet in the next class.

67
00:04:43,895 --> 00:04:45,895
I wish you all happiness with all kinds of love.

68
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:46,898
Class.

69
00:04:47,285 --> 00:04:49,285
Thank you, Teacher.

70
00:04:52,227 --> 00:04:53,720
How are you holding up?

71
00:04:55,585 --> 00:04:58,623
Teacher Sani just put you in tragedy.

72
00:04:58,623 --> 00:04:59,622
How did you like that?

73
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,880
Teacher Sani isn’t my type.

74
00:05:03,575 --> 00:05:05,787
There are lots of girls in my night school.

75
00:05:07,132 --> 00:05:07,912
Hey.

76
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,760
The report is done.

77
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,427
You turn it in.

78
00:05:12,772 --> 00:05:13,639
Thanks.

79
00:05:18,564 --> 00:05:19,668
And you, Akk?

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Does a quiet man like you talk to lots of girls?

81
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:26,171
I don’t care about that stuff.

82
00:05:26,968 --> 00:05:28,213
Are you sure?

83
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:30,113
You’re so hot.

84
00:05:30,837 --> 00:05:32,224
You know nothing, Namo.

85
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,218
Akk is a hermit.

86
00:05:34,455 --> 00:05:37,163
He will keep his virginity to himself forever.

87
00:05:39,212 --> 00:05:41,873
Stop teasing him about this.

88
00:05:41,873 --> 00:05:43,035
Poor him.

89
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,869
Is it true you’re a virgin?

90
00:05:51,578 --> 00:05:52,597
Time to make the rounds.

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,883
I’m checking the places.

92
00:05:54,883 --> 00:05:55,716
Let’s go.

93
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,870
I can go alone.

94
00:05:58,158 --> 00:06:00,158
I’m coming with you. Wait.

95
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:04,493
Is he mad because we said he’s a virgin?

96
00:06:04,493 --> 00:06:05,664
I guess so.

97
00:06:05,972 --> 00:06:07,547
Good. I’m pretty lazy right now.

98
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,520
[Student Welfare Department]

99
00:06:32,816 --> 00:06:34,816
You did very well on the test.

100
00:06:36,404 --> 00:06:38,404
But if we are to hire you,

101
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,894
you must take on one more role.

102
00:06:42,001 --> 00:06:43,506
Will you accept that condition?

103
00:06:44,762 --> 00:06:45,889
What role?

104
00:06:45,889 --> 00:06:47,821
You will be an assistant in the student welfare department

105
00:06:48,246 --> 00:06:50,246
replacing the one who just quit.

106
00:06:55,997 --> 00:06:57,690
But I never…

107
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,827
Just follow the instructions of Teacher Chadok,

108
00:07:00,827 --> 00:07:02,019
the Head of the Student Welfare Department.

109
00:07:10,461 --> 00:07:11,824
You can do it, Sani.

110
00:07:24,603 --> 00:07:25,370
Singto.

111
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:33,633
Singto, yum yum.

112
00:07:34,184 --> 00:07:37,175
With dogs, you’re always smiley.

113
00:07:41,943 --> 00:07:43,801
There’s one dog that won't get to see me smile.

114
00:07:45,848 --> 00:07:47,187
What are you doing here?

115
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:50,760
Are you here to consult this dog since you started school three weeks late?

116
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,000
Just pet the dog.

117
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:56,840
Don’t turn into one.

118
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:03,408
Wait a minute.

119
00:08:03,903 --> 00:08:05,400
Did you follow me here?

120
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:06,725
What are you planning to do?

121
00:08:06,826 --> 00:08:07,906
Ambush me?

122
00:08:10,797 --> 00:08:11,995
I’ve got something to ask.

123
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:14,325
What?

124
00:08:16,778 --> 00:08:19,276
So you’re…

125
00:08:21,046 --> 00:08:22,025
You’re still a virgin?

126
00:08:23,046 --> 00:08:24,350
Are you really a virgin?

127
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,005
Shut up!

128
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:29,438
So it’s true.

129
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:36,300
Shut your mouth or I’ll punch it until it bleeds.

130
00:08:38,908 --> 00:08:40,073
The same rule applies.

131
00:08:41,465 --> 00:08:42,300
You punch me.

132
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:43,750
I…

133
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:48,154
Psychopath.

134

[Student Welfare Department]

135
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,622
Is there anything you need?

136
00:09:25,155 --> 00:09:25,945
Nothing.

137
00:09:27,903 --> 00:09:29,113
Why are you wearing this?

138
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:30,497
It’s against the rule.

139
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:37,776
Wearing accessories isn’t permitted either.

140
00:09:38,858 --> 00:09:39,963
Are you new?

141

Yes, sir.

142
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:43,434
Take it off.

143
00:09:44,472 --> 00:09:46,359
Tell your legal guardian to get it back later.

144

No.

145
00:09:48,985 --> 00:09:51,268
Someone I love gave it to me.

146
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:58,493
Keep it then.

147
00:09:59,649 --> 00:10:00,909
But you will be punished.

148

You will be assigned social service.

Yes, sir.

Do you realize what you did is wrong?

00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,096
Are you guys with me?

174
00:11:29,836 --> 00:11:33,251
Issues like this remind me of Teacher Dika.

175
00:11:33,561 --> 00:11:36,858
If he was still here, he’d be able to deal with those rule breakers.

176
00:11:36,858 --> 00:11:38,910
Can we stop talking about that traitor?

177
00:11:39,116 --> 00:11:40,290
I don’t want to hear it.

178
00:12:22,434 --> 00:12:27,200
Don’t you even think you can blind people, authoritarian.

179
00:12:29,742 --> 00:12:31,320
You’re violating my rights.

180
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,345
What rights?

181
00:12:34,314 --> 00:12:36,314
Guys, can you lend me a hand?

182
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:38,080
Boyfriend?

183
00:13:06,121 --> 00:13:08,755
Guys, our leaflets are all gone.

184
00:13:08,918 --> 00:13:10,918
There are also gone from the board upstairs.

185
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,988
Are we really being punished by that curse?

186
00:13:14,129 --> 00:13:16,585
Stop it, both of you, Jumnian and Jumnong.

187
00:13:16,854 --> 00:13:18,351
The curse, my ass.

188
00:13:18,625 --> 00:13:20,931
Of course, the school board wanted them gone.

189
00:13:21,252 --> 00:13:23,361
It’s scary anyway.

190
00:13:25,163 --> 00:13:26,183
Perhaps…

191
00:13:28,283 --> 00:13:29,263
There.

192
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,680
Speaking of the devil.

193
00:13:31,117 --> 00:13:33,165
Sorry. What does that mean?

194
00:13:33,165 --> 00:13:34,416
Meaning the one doing this is here.

195
00:13:35,429 --> 00:13:38,614
Don’t you even think you can blind people,

196
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:39,957
authoritarian.

197
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:41,883
We’re not scared of you.

198
00:13:42,345 --> 00:13:43,280
Bring it on.

199
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:47,472
And he’s gone.

200
00:13:47,945 --> 00:13:49,154
It must be him.

201
00:13:49,154 --> 00:13:50,142
Where are they?

202
00:13:50,142 --> 00:13:51,963
I spent hours putting them up.

203
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:53,267
Not ready?

204
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:55,464
What do you mean not ready?

205
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,401
I gave you guys a week to do the assignment.

206
00:13:58,711 --> 00:14:00,534
It’s a team project.

207
00:14:00,821 --> 00:14:03,543
If you can’t handle this small task, what can you do in life?

208
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:07,784
I’m so sorry, Teacher.

209
00:14:08,331 --> 00:14:11,146
As the head of the class, I take full responsibility.

210
00:14:11,695 --> 00:14:14,814
If you want to deduct scores, deduct mine.

211
00:14:16,521 --> 00:14:19,133
I’m so disappointed in you, Thuaphu.

212
00:14:20,914 --> 00:14:22,389
And in all of you.

213
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:26,070
The students in the best class are so misbehaving.

214

215
00:14:29,454 --> 00:14:31,170
Thank you, Teacher.

216
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:32,400
Where are you going, ma’am?

217
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:34,854
Ask your friends.

218
00:14:37,673 --> 00:14:39,934
Kan, where have you been?

219
00:14:40,453 --> 00:14:41,610
And where is the presentation file?

220
00:14:41,851 --> 00:14:42,694
Here.

221
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:44,138
Why didn’t you turn it in for us?

222
00:14:44,445 --> 00:14:45,920
The whole class just got scolded.

223
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:47,423
I…

224
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:49,221
Thua took all the blame for you.

225
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:52,430
Don’t be so dramatic.

226
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:53,983
I’m okay.

227
00:14:54,352 --> 00:14:57,094
You guys hand me your next assignments.

228
00:14:57,094 --> 00:14:58,034
I’ll turn them in for you.

229
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:01,880
What?

230
00:16:05,663 --> 00:16:06,886
I bought you snacks.

231
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:10,297
I know you like them.

232
00:16:10,297 --> 00:16:11,368
And they’re pink.

233
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:13,425
I tried and it’s good.

234
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:16,914
I am sorry.

235
00:16:24,086 --> 00:16:26,392
Tell me why you were late today.

236
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:31,691
I had a fight with 11th graders.

237
00:16:32,478 --> 00:16:33,454

238
00:16:34,288 --> 00:16:35,194
Are you nuts?

239
00:16:35,719 --> 00:16:37,094
You’re a student council.

240
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:39,104
You’re not a bully.

241
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:44,505
What was it all about?

242
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:47,177
Not your business.

243
00:16:47,702 --> 00:16:48,838
I’m going to play football.

244
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:51,811
He’s not answering.

245
00:16:57,244 --> 00:16:58,294
Can I join you?

246
00:16:58,841 --> 00:16:59,550
Sure.

251
00:17:34,328 --> 00:17:36,940
Want to smoke so much that you have to do it now?

252
00:17:38,379 --> 00:17:40,379
Do you even have evidence?

253
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,499
You think I’m that stupid?

254
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,577
You dumped it in the toilet.

255
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:45,845
The smell is still here.

256
00:17:47,881 --> 00:17:48,838
Nice nose.

257
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,783
Just like a dog’s nose.

258

That’s how you speak with your senior?

260
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:00,214
You don’t need to know which class.

261
00:18:00,368 --> 00:18:03,068
But I know your name is Kanlong from class 6/1.

262
00:18:03,068 --> 00:18:05,543
And the head of the class is a fag.

263
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,411
What did you just say?

264
00:18:11,723 --> 00:18:12,702
Did you just hit my friend?

265
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:14,221
Did you just hit my friend?

266
00:18:14,221 --> 00:18:14,856
Ouch!

267
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:27,094
He was trying to protect you, Thua.

268
00:18:28,415 --> 00:18:29,628
I rushed back to class.

269
00:18:30,251 --> 00:18:31,857
I thought he would follow me.

270
00:18:32,954 --> 00:18:35,374
But I guess he went to the infirmary first. That’s why he’s late.

Don’t tell anyone about this.

273
00:18:41,746 --> 00:18:44,974
Or Kan might get kicked out of the Prefect Club.

00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:46,909
Okay.

If you want me to share, ask nicely.

I don’t want to hear the music. I’m taking them from you.

You’re in a classroom. You can’t use earphones.

But it’s break time. We don’t have class now.

281

Give them back.

282

I’m curious about one thing.

283
00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:50,334
Why did you ask Mr. Sit about the accident and the former student welfare assistant?

284
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:55,593
None of your business.

No. Is Teacher Dika your boyfriend?

00:23:28,431 --> 00:23:31,918
Do you think we students should still wear school uniforms?

342
00:23:31,918 --> 00:23:33,297
Are you talking back to me, Ayan?

343
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:36,098
You’re a student. You must abide by textbooks.

344
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:39,643
I agree with you, ma’am.

345
00:23:57,186 --> 00:24:02,095
♪ Tired of loving someone secretly? ♪

346
00:24:02,638 --> 00:24:06,887
♪ Tired of missing that person one-sidedly? ♪

347
00:24:08,027 --> 00:24:11,889
♪ I wanted to pretend I didn’t know ♪

348
00:24:11,889 --> 00:24:12,578
Oh,

349
00:24:13,362 --> 00:24:14,186
shit!

350
00:24:16,475 --> 00:24:17,634
What the hell happened?

351
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:18,746
Did you get burnt by hot water?

352
00:24:18,746 --> 00:24:22,819
The Japanese movie by my beloved director is showing in Bangkok.

353
00:24:23,217 --> 00:24:24,752
Do you want to catch it with me?

354
00:24:27,487 --> 00:24:28,433
- No.
- No.

355
00:24:29,089 --> 00:24:30,255
I think I’ll pass.

356
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:33,298
Your favorite movies always put me to sleep.

357
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:34,499
I don’t get them.

358
00:24:34,499 --> 00:24:35,214
True.

359
00:24:35,214 --> 00:24:36,479
We like mass movies.

360
00:24:36,628 --> 00:24:38,977
We just can’t relate to indie movies.

361
00:24:40,428 --> 00:24:44,038
Are you letting me go by myself?

362
00:24:45,912 --> 00:24:46,593
- Yes.
- Yes.

363
00:24:55,372 --> 00:24:57,101
What an unloyal friend!

364
00:24:57,873 --> 00:24:59,873
You’re not going with me.

365
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:00,551
Go by yourself.

366
00:25:00,551 --> 00:25:02,008
I don’t want to watch it.

367
00:25:03,807 --> 00:25:04,896
Did you just hit me?

368
00:25:04,896 --> 00:25:06,204
That’s enough, you assholes.

369
00:25:07,055 --> 00:25:07,738
Wat,

370
00:25:08,595 --> 00:25:10,979
are you sure you can grab your ticket before Bangkokians?

371
00:25:14,901 --> 00:25:22,156
The Country Development Plan by People's Party originated in General Phraya Phahonphonphayuhasena’s era.

372
00:25:22,875 --> 00:25:27,124
It gradually evolved into Thai Nationalism Policy under the government of Field Marshal Plaek.

373
00:25:27,778 --> 00:25:30,127
Any of you know what he did back then?

374
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:36,279
Wasuwat!

375
00:25:37,268 --> 00:25:38,345
Are you hearing me?

376
00:25:38,849 --> 00:25:39,474
I am.

377
00:25:41,085 --> 00:25:42,022
Teacher,

378
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:44,831
you are loud and clear.

379
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:46,752
Of course, he hears you.

380
00:25:48,269 --> 00:25:49,135
Kanlong,

381
00:25:50,237 --> 00:25:52,877
People who have been well-educated by their families

382
00:25:52,877 --> 00:25:56,228
know they shouldn’t interrupt when adults are not speaking with them.

383
00:25:58,787 --> 00:25:59,580
So?

384
00:26:00,446 --> 00:26:02,136
What were Field Marshal Plaek’s policies?

385
00:26:03,492 --> 00:26:04,181
Such as…

386
00:26:05,829 --> 00:26:09,952
the cultural revolution that required the wearing of hats.

387
00:26:10,434 --> 00:26:11,397
Why wearing hats?

388
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:16,506
To symbolize equality?

389
00:26:18,063 --> 00:26:19,255
Equality?

390
00:26:20,574 --> 00:26:22,526
In the ‘Mala Nam Thai’ era?

391
00:26:25,686 --> 00:26:32,340
The Mala Nam Thai Plan was established to bring Thais up to the same level of civilization as western nations.

392
00:26:32,575 --> 00:26:36,185
He was a dictator and a nationalist. Why would he want equality?

393
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:42,688
What is it?

394
00:26:43,502 --> 00:26:45,512
Wat’s answer isn’t wrong.

395
00:26:48,646 --> 00:26:49,851
Not wrong?

396
00:26:51,157 --> 00:26:55,251
The rich’s hats and the poor’s hats were made of different materials, to begin with.

397
00:26:55,251 --> 00:26:58,960
Do you think having anything covering the skulls makes everyone equal?

398
00:26:59,471 --> 00:27:00,657
What a dumb answer.

399
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:08,271
It’s true Field Marshal Plaek was a dictator.

400
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:10,985
But he was a member of People’s Party.

401
00:27:11,141 --> 00:27:17,970
And we can’t deny that he was against the old power and reclaimed equality for citizens.

402
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:20,144
Stop it, Ayan.

403
00:27:23,725 --> 00:27:28,547
Do you think we students should still wear school uniforms?

404
00:27:28,871 --> 00:27:29,785
Of course.

405
00:27:30,095 --> 00:27:31,608
To maintain orderliness.

406
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,928
The same goes for wearing hats.

407
00:27:34,633 --> 00:27:36,633
Nothing different to wearing school uniforms.

408
00:27:37,986 --> 00:27:41,014
It creates equality and reduces inequality.

409
00:27:41,249 --> 00:27:42,978
More importantly, Teacher,

410
00:27:43,159 --> 00:27:47,816
school uniform originated in Field Marshal Plaek’s era,

411
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:50,469
the one you just called a dictator.

412
00:27:50,933 --> 00:27:52,269
Are you talking back to me, Ayan?

413
00:27:52,269 --> 00:27:53,301
No.

414
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:55,859
I’m just sharing the information.

415
00:27:56,165 --> 00:28:00,124
Telling you that historical ideals cannot be summed into a single concept.

416
00:28:03,821 --> 00:28:07,973
Referencing the information I searched here.

417
00:28:10,953 --> 00:28:16,230
Information on the internet where anyone can edit it as they please?

418
00:28:16,681 --> 00:28:19,476
You’re a student. You must abide by textbooks.

419
00:28:24,484 --> 00:28:25,844
I agree with you, ma’am.

420
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:31,325
I think Wasuwat’s answer is wrong.

421
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,269
Ayan’s answer is also wrong.

422
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,440
Since we’re studying from the textbook,

423
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:40,292
we should discuss what’s stated in the textbook.

424
00:28:42,499 --> 00:28:45,365
Textbooks aren’t martial law.

425
00:28:45,832 --> 00:28:50,045
And good education should be receptive and open to development.

426
00:28:50,045 --> 00:28:53,560
Not putting us in a frame and judging who is right or wrong.

427
00:28:53,716 --> 00:28:54,717
Right, Teacher?

428
00:28:56,365 --> 00:28:57,519
Am I right?

429
00:28:58,569 --> 00:29:03,187
I still stand that Wasuwat’s answer is wrong, and so is Ayan’s.

430
00:29:03,187 --> 00:29:04,685
I said stop!

431
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:11,371
I’m not judging who is right or wrong today.

432
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:18,011
However, you must pair up and do the report on Field Marshal Plaek, which is due next Monday.

433
00:29:18,011 --> 00:29:22,557
You must reference at least 15 textbooks.

434
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,376
Class.

435
00:29:30,016 --> 00:29:32,144
Thank you, Teacher.

436
00:29:40,893 --> 00:29:43,145
Are you happy putting everyone in trouble?

437
00:29:55,386 --> 00:29:56,632
What the heck did you do?

438
00:29:56,632 --> 00:29:57,386
Hey!

439
00:29:59,361 --> 00:30:02,725
Why did you take the teacher’s side instead of Wat’s?

440
00:30:03,454 --> 00:30:04,702
Do you want the best student title?

441
00:30:05,633 --> 00:30:06,909
Calm down, Kan.

442
00:30:07,331 --> 00:30:09,331
Akk has his reasons.

443
00:30:10,972 --> 00:30:12,135
Why are you protecting him?

444
00:30:14,598 --> 00:30:15,435
I’m sorry.

445
00:30:17,456 --> 00:30:19,456
I just didn’t want things to go too far.

446
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:23,611
Kan.

447
00:30:24,561 --> 00:30:26,104
Have you forgotten our rule?

448
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:31,245
We promised if we had a conflict, we would resolve it the same day.

449
00:30:31,245 --> 00:30:32,115
We wouldn’t leave it overnight.

450
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,491
I don’t want to talk to him.

451
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:35,725
Hey!

452
00:30:36,946 --> 00:30:39,489
Akk was helping me.

453
00:30:40,245 --> 00:30:43,447
He was making Teacher Waree think she had a backup.

454
00:30:44,148 --> 00:30:47,234
You know people her age hate to lose faces.

455
00:30:47,645 --> 00:30:48,871
It’s a big deal.

456
00:30:53,389 --> 00:30:54,241
Is that true, Akk?

457
00:30:56,439 --> 00:30:57,062
Um.

458
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,953
He was trying to help, and so was Ayan.

459
00:31:04,187 --> 00:31:05,725
But they chose different methods.

460
00:31:08,222 --> 00:31:12,471
So you’re willing to be the bad guy just to protect your classmates?

461
00:31:14,652 --> 00:31:15,488
Damn you!

462
00:31:20,586 --> 00:31:21,509
Come to think of it,

463
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:23,827
Aye was pretty cool.

464
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:26,597
He was totally talking back to Aunt Waree.

465
00:31:28,083 --> 00:31:30,083
Not as cool as Akk, my dear friend.

466
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:32,582
Right, Akk, my beloved friend?

467
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:38,392
I’m sorry.

468
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:46,367
Why didn’t tell me earlier?

469
00:32:03,107 --> 00:32:04,331
What are you doing with my jacket?

470
00:32:11,675 --> 00:32:12,717
What’s wrong, Big Foot?

471
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:14,334
You’re tense.

472
00:32:14,843 --> 00:32:15,605
Ouch!

473
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,968
You want it now, Shortstop?

474
00:32:17,968 --> 00:32:19,348
Yes, Big Foot.

475
00:32:19,662 --> 00:32:21,313
If you don’t stop, I’ll kick your ass.

476
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:11,462
What are you doing with my jacket?

477
00:33:15,858 --> 00:33:19,083
I was wondering if you forgot it and if I should keep it for you.

478
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:23,873
Why did you leave your belongings unattended?

479
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:31,693
Drink up.

480
00:33:32,083 --> 00:33:33,134
Singto, do you want some?

481
00:33:33,351 --> 00:33:34,103
Singto.

482
00:33:35,093 --> 00:33:36,155
Singto.

483
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:37,774
Singto.

484
00:33:37,774 --> 00:33:38,432
Do you want this?

485
00:33:38,432 --> 00:33:39,057
Singto.

486
00:33:41,424 --> 00:33:42,283
Are you finished?

487
00:33:44,297 --> 00:33:45,629
The dog doesn’t want it so it’s yours.

488
00:33:45,764 --> 00:33:46,988
You eat it.

489
00:33:47,518 --> 00:33:48,391
Singto.

490
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:50,822
Show the dog how to eat.

491
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:54,893
You do it.

492
00:34:05,991 --> 00:34:06,991
Why are you looking at me?

493
00:34:09,382 --> 00:34:10,382
Say what you want.

494
00:34:15,545 --> 00:34:16,424
Nothing.

495
00:34:17,873 --> 00:34:20,724
The dog is pretty cute,

496
00:34:22,584 --> 00:34:23,575
wouldn’t you say?

497
00:34:31,092 --> 00:34:32,343
Hey, wait.

498
00:35:11,687 --> 00:35:13,964
Why do I need to do the report with a nerd like you?

499
00:35:28,974 --> 00:35:29,776
Next time,

500
00:35:30,525 --> 00:35:32,644
do not protect me like that again.

501
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:34,334
I’m used to it.

502
00:35:35,244 --> 00:35:37,797
I don’t care if they want to bully me.

503
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:43,145
I just don’t want to see you get hurt again.

504
00:36:01,249 --> 00:36:02,766
Let’s begin.

505
00:36:25,845 --> 00:36:26,806
Ayan,

506
00:36:28,804 --> 00:36:29,843
where are you going?

507
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:32,747
What is it, sir?

508
00:36:32,964 --> 00:36:36,015
You must take makeup tests to catch up with your friends, got it?

509
00:36:36,622 --> 00:36:38,815
And you can’t remember a damn technique.

510
00:36:40,724 --> 00:36:41,674
Guys,

511
00:36:42,447 --> 00:36:46,589
I need a volunteer to train and help him learn.

512
00:36:55,665 --> 00:36:56,868
I volunteer, sir.

513
00:36:58,994 --> 00:36:59,725
Yeah.

514
00:36:59,725 --> 00:37:01,453
I knew you’d volunteer, Akk.

515
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:05,522
This evening, you two practice the basic techniques you just learned.

516
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,661
Come here.

517
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:18,358
Hold here.

518
00:37:18,477 --> 00:37:19,632
The other hand.

519
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,858
That’s it?

520
00:37:23,858 --> 00:37:24,636
Yes.

521
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,072
Bastard.

522
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:35,192
Do you need to throw me so hard?

523
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:36,643
Stay focused.

524
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:39,944
I’m focused.

525
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:47,111
Get up.

526
00:37:48,804 --> 00:37:49,530
Up.

527
00:37:54,797 --> 00:37:55,480
Come here.

528
00:37:56,374 --> 00:37:57,280
Come closer.

529
00:38:00,281 --> 00:38:01,415
You throw me this time.

530
00:38:02,816 --> 00:38:03,682
Do it.

531
00:38:04,109 --> 00:38:04,872
Okay.

532
00:38:05,597 --> 00:38:06,496
Right position.

533
00:38:10,202 --> 00:38:10,891
Go on.

534
00:38:11,084 --> 00:38:11,915
I’ll go now.

535
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:12,415
Go.

536
00:38:19,509 --> 00:38:20,627
That’s all you got?

537
00:38:34,564 --> 00:38:35,929
You’re weak, Shortstop.

538
00:38:39,813 --> 00:38:40,823
Will you let me go?

539
00:38:41,306 --> 00:38:42,006
No.

540
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:44,918
I said let me go.

541
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:47,682
If you want to be free, try to squirm free.

542
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:49,062
Suppose you can do it.

543
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:02,241
What’s wrong, Big Foot?

544
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,258
You’re tense.

545
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:08,440
Hm?

546
00:39:12,444 --> 00:39:13,433
I’m taking off.

547
00:39:13,892 --> 00:39:15,433
Just realized I’ve got something to do.

548
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,015
Why do you slouch?

549
00:39:30,858 --> 00:39:33,534
If you don’t want to, you don’t need to help me.

550
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:36,004
I don’t want anyone in the class to fail

551
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:37,905
or our average score will be less than other classes.

552
00:39:41,075 --> 00:39:42,349
Can I borrow your shampoo?

553
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:43,564
I forgot to bring mine.

554
00:39:50,808 --> 00:39:51,638
Shower gel too.

555
00:39:52,242 --> 00:39:53,412
I haven’t used it yet.

556
00:39:53,783 --> 00:39:55,421
I know.

557
00:39:55,421 --> 00:39:56,096
Come on.

558
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,624
Ouch!

559
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,136
You want it now, Shortstop?

560
00:40:07,573 --> 00:40:08,865
Yes, Big Foot.

561
00:40:10,387 --> 00:40:11,530
Yes what?

562
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,503
You asked if I wanted it.

563
00:40:13,503 --> 00:40:14,782
I said yes.

564
00:40:16,005 --> 00:40:17,604
Should I go into your room right now?

565
00:40:17,888 --> 00:40:18,618
No.

566
00:40:19,198 --> 00:40:20,903
f you don’t stop, I’ll kick your ass.

567
00:40:20,903 --> 00:40:22,030
Just take a shower.

568
00:40:31,376 --> 00:40:34,898
You’re tough on the outside.

569
00:40:35,459 --> 00:40:36,734
But on the inside…

570
00:40:38,027 --> 00:40:39,176
Will you stop or not?

571
00:40:43,804 --> 00:40:46,008
I know you came to mess with my school.

572
00:40:46,245 --> 00:40:51,168
But your method isn’t working on me.

573
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:53,118
Yeah?

574
00:40:53,335 --> 00:40:54,096
Yeah.

575
00:41:27,197 --> 00:41:29,632
Why did you even volunteer to help him, Akk?

576
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:41,097
We are students, not prisoners.
[Students are not prisoners.]

577
00:41:41,545 --> 00:41:43,545
No to school uniform.

578
00:41:43,545 --> 00:41:45,238
Give us back the freedom.

579
00:41:45,238 --> 00:41:46,643
Give us back our rights.

580
00:41:46,643 --> 00:41:48,113
No to school uniform.

581
00:41:48,113 --> 00:41:49,699
Give us back the freedom.

582
00:41:49,699 --> 00:41:50,757
Give us back our rights.

583
00:41:50,757 --> 00:41:51,771
Give back!

584
00:41:51,771 --> 00:41:52,795
Give us back!

585
00:41:52,795 --> 00:41:53,519
Hey.

586
00:41:53,965 --> 00:41:55,313
Why are you guys making noise?

587
00:41:56,249 --> 00:41:57,476
It’s break time.

588
00:41:58,025 --> 00:42:01,305
Because it’s break time, we’re making a statement now.

589
00:42:01,305 --> 00:42:03,434
We’re not bothering any class.

590
00:42:04,534 --> 00:42:05,114
Right.

591
00:42:05,283 --> 00:42:07,355
And we have the right, don’t we?

592
00:42:08,272 --> 00:42:10,272
But you are violating the others’ rights.

593
00:42:11,019 --> 00:42:12,764
I don’t think we are.

594
00:42:13,028 --> 00:42:15,511
Kan, Wat, take them.

595
00:42:15,841 --> 00:42:17,841
Hey, what are you doing?

596
00:42:17,841 --> 00:42:19,061
These are ours.

597
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:20,856
You have no right to do this.

598
00:42:20,856 --> 00:42:21,541
Give that back.

599
00:42:21,541 --> 00:42:22,678
Stop causing trouble.

600
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:26,724
If you aren’t scared of us, be scared of the curse.

601
00:42:26,724 --> 00:42:29,306
But you don’t have the right to take our stuff.

602
00:42:29,854 --> 00:42:30,788
We do.

603
00:42:31,171 --> 00:42:32,404
We are student prefects.

604
00:42:32,404 --> 00:42:33,391
We have the right.

605
00:42:43,501 --> 00:42:45,404
Don’t you butt in, Ayan.

606
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:53,484
Let’s call it a day.

607
00:42:53,605 --> 00:42:54,762
This is enough to make their heads spin.

608
00:42:55,241 --> 00:42:56,275
Sure.

609
00:42:59,033 --> 00:43:01,033
Nong, Nian, that’s it for today.

610
00:43:01,033 --> 00:43:01,731
Let’s go.

611
00:43:02,142 --> 00:43:03,115
Wait.

612
00:43:03,671 --> 00:43:04,915
May I have that back, please?

613
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:05,762
May I?

614
00:43:05,762 --> 00:43:06,567
Thank you.

615
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,856
What did you speak to them?

616
00:43:17,532 --> 00:43:19,378
I spoke a normal human language.

617
00:43:20,855 --> 00:43:22,855
Not a power-crazed language like yours.

618
00:43:35,163 --> 00:43:36,632
Take it from here, guys.

619
00:43:38,185 --> 00:43:38,965
Hey!

620
00:43:39,182 --> 00:43:40,402
Time to go.

621
00:43:40,402 --> 00:43:42,010
Back to class.

622
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:43,127
To your classes.

623
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:50,887
Ayan.

624
00:43:52,844 --> 00:43:54,249
What’s your deal with them?

625
00:43:54,249 --> 00:43:54,852
Reveal it.

626
00:43:56,661 --> 00:44:01,632
You really want to know about that or want to have some alone time with me?

627
00:44:02,671 --> 00:44:04,164
What a narcissist.

628
00:44:04,592 --> 00:44:06,447
Who would want to be close to you?

629
00:44:06,447 --> 00:44:07,203
Why not?

630
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,120
What can be a problem if you’re close to me?

631
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:28,925
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

632
00:44:30,884 --> 00:44:33,966
It’s time we intensify our protest.

633
00:44:34,317 --> 00:44:39,524
I’m going to wreck Suppalo and they’ll make up for the shit they did, Uncle.

634
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,554
I came to warn you to watch out for Aye.

635
00:44:48,524 --> 00:44:51,418
Are you afraid to be alone with me?

636
00:44:51,418 --> 00:44:54,447
When you’re beat, you’re pretty cute.
