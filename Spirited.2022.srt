1
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:44,127
<i>Do people really change?
I mean, real, lasting, positive change.</i>

2
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:49,299
<i>I sure hope so,
because we are in the business of change.</i>

3
00:00:57,641 --> 00:01:01,228
Please. Please.

4
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:03,730
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:08,360
I'm so sorry.

6
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:14,825
I'm sorry. I won't yell
at the neighbor's kids anymore.

7
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,744
I'll take back the claim
against the Johnsons,

8
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:20,998
even though that tree house
is a flagrant violation...

9
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,251
I'm sorry! No! Please! I can change.

10
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:29,047
I promise! Please. Please, I...

11
00:01:29,131 --> 00:01:32,134
Please give me another chance.
I can change!

12
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:36,972
<i>Don't worry about her. In
a few minutes, she'll wake up in her bed.</i>

13
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:40,350
<i>Dry, rested and hopefully
a whole new person.</i>

14
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:43,645
All right! She's back in bed.
Could I get a coffee over here?

15
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:45,272
Coffees flying in.

16
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:49,526
<i>You see,
this is just a supernatural simulation.</i>

17
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,611
<i>And these are my colleagues,</i>

18
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,487
<i>The Ghost of Christmas Past,</i>

19
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,698
- <i>Christmas Yet-to-Come…</i>
- No doubt.

20
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,076
Oh, boy. That looks good. Thank you.

21
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:03,999
<i>And that's me. Mr. Brad Pitt.
No. No, I'm kidding.</i>

22
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:06,752
<i>I'm The Ghost of Christmas Present.
I'm not Brad Pitt.</i>

23
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,672
So, you think she changed?

24
00:02:10,756 --> 00:02:13,050
I mean, I don't know.
This one was a serious tight-ass.

25
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,426
Of course she's changed.

26
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,220
I brought her face-to-face
with her mortality,

27
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:18,305
and that's when I close the deal
every time.

28
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,016
Anyone can point to a headstone.
Everyone agrees with me.

29
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,392
- Guys, please.
- You know what?

30
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,102
I do way more than just point at it.

31
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,312
That hurts me.

32
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,522
Yet-to-Come is a wrap.

33
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:29,733
{\an8}Inform Mr. Marley
our perp will awaken in two minutes.

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:30,901
{\an8}Copy that.

35
00:02:31,652 --> 00:02:32,819
{\an8}<i>Marley-san, Marley-san!</i>

36
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,158
{\an8}- Already?
- Yeah.

37
00:02:38,242 --> 00:02:42,329
{\an8}Excellent. Thank you, Kazuko.
Very exciting.

38
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,998
{\an8}Spirits, gather up, one and all!

39
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,917
{\an8}Research, Locations,

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,002
{\an8}Costume Department!

41
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,505
{\an8}<i>This is our dedicated staff
of support ghosts.</i>

42
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:54,508
<i>They work so hard to make us look good.</i>

43
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,426
Okay. We are walking.

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,305
New recruits, I know you're freshly dead,
but let's look alive.

45
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:02,474
You've enlisted at the perfect time.

46
00:03:02,558 --> 00:03:05,227
They're on their way to find out
if the person we've haunted

47
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,895
is really going to change.

48
00:03:06,979 --> 00:03:08,021
Can we go see that?

49
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,356
No. Come on.

50
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,573
<i>And this is the moment
we worked all year for.</i>

51
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,827
- No, honey, don't go in her yard!
- We don't want her calling the police.

52
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,328
It's okay. I can get it.

53
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,709
Sorry, Ms. Blansky.
We'll take the game down the street.

54
00:03:28,792 --> 00:03:30,002
We don't want any trouble today.

55
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:32,254
What day is this?

56
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,173
It's Christmas Day.

57
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,467
- The ghosts did it all in one night.
- Are you okay?

58
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,845
Do you need us to call someone?

59
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,847
Or do you wanna play?

60
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,973
Me?

61
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,808
Sure. If you want to.

62
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:48,979
After all the times I've reported you
to the HOA or called the police

63
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:50,981
or stolen your packages?

64
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,399
You did what?

65
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:00,657
Go ahead. Give it a try. It's fun.

66
00:04:05,454 --> 00:04:06,455
Yeah!

67
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,494
Congratulations, Ms. Blansky.

68
00:04:45,577 --> 00:04:47,246
I did it? You mean it's really...

69
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,081
You're a different person now, Karen.

70
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:53,335
Go make amends, and make us proud.

71
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:57,005
I will. I promise you, I will!

72
00:04:58,590 --> 00:04:59,591
Attagirl, Karen!

73
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,219
Appreciate it so much.
All the way in the b...

74
00:05:14,189 --> 00:05:15,274
Could I join in?

75
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:17,067
<i>So, that's what we do.</i>

76
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,778
<i>We haunt someone,
change them into a better person,</i>

77
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,655
{\an8}<i>and then we sing about it.</i>

78
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,534
{\an8}<i>You wait for the day
You prep for a year</i>

79
00:05:25,617 --> 00:05:28,328
{\an8}<i>And when the big day is finally here</i>

80
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:32,207
{\an8}<i>You take a jerk and work
To turn 'em around</i>

81
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,625
Why are they singing?

82
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,627
Because this is a musical.

83
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,962
What is?

84
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,506
All of this. The afterlife.

85
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:42,176
{\an8}Yay! I had a feeling.

86
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,011
{\an8}Come on. Really?

87
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,849
{\an8}<i>You show them their life
And you hope for the switch</i>

88
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:55,480
{\an8}<i>And when it goes off without a hitch
This Christmas train is party-bound</i>

89
00:05:55,981 --> 00:05:59,067
{\an8}Bring on the Chili of Positive Outcome!

90
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:01,195
{\an8}<i>We're giddy with a holiday
Goodwill gleam</i>

91
00:06:01,278 --> 00:06:04,489
{\an8}<i>'Cause helping out is sweeter
Than eggnog cream</i>

92
00:06:04,573 --> 00:06:09,578
{\an8}<i>We might be dead
But we're living that Yuletide dream</i>

93
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:12,623
{\an8}<i>We're full of that
Christmas morning feeling</i>

94
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:15,501
{\an8}<i>Is there a morning more appealing?</i>

95
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:18,879
{\an8}<i>The magical mood when being merry
Is very necessary</i>

96
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,340
{\an8}<i>We're changing all mankind</i>

97
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,343
{\an8}<i>We planted the seeds
And joy is blooming</i>

98
00:06:24,426 --> 00:06:27,429
{\an8}<i>Now we got one less hateful human</i>

99
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:29,932
{\an8}<i>We're doing the world a world of good</i>

100
00:06:30,015 --> 00:06:33,185
{\an8}<i>Putting some nice
Into the neighborhood</i>

101
00:06:33,268 --> 00:06:38,649
{\an8}<i>Playing our parts, changing hearts
One by one</i>

102
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:43,111
{\an8}<i>We got that Christmas morning feeling
And damn, is it fun</i>

103
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:46,031
{\an8}<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la</i>

104
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:50,869
{\an8}<i>Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

105
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:54,164
{\an8}Dude, I can't dance like this. Are you
gonna be able to keep up with all this?

106
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:58,043
{\an8}I mean, if I start dancing, I'm gonna shut
it down, man. Everybody gonna look bad.

107
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,921
{\an8}<i>We're full of that
Christmas morning feeling</i>

108
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:03,924
{\an8}<i>The tingle when
Jingle bells are pealing</i>

109
00:07:04,007 --> 00:07:05,592
{\an8}<i>Everything's super holly-jolly</i>

110
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:07,469
{\an8}<i>It's like we're all on Molly</i>

111
00:07:07,553 --> 00:07:09,513
{\an8}<i>But it's a natural high</i>

112
00:07:09,596 --> 00:07:12,683
{\an8}<i>Everything shines a little brighter</i>

113
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:15,561
{\an8}<i>I'm feeling warm as apple cider</i>

114
00:07:15,644 --> 00:07:18,480
{\an8}<i>We're doing the world a world of good</i>

115
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:21,483
{\an8}<i>Feels like a kick-ass Christmas should</i>

116
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:26,446
{\an8}<i>Playing our parts, changing hearts
One by one</i>

117
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,825
Hey, does somebody clear out
our search history after we die?

118
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:34,246
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la, fa-la-la-la-la</i>

119
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,541
<i>Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

120
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:41,795
{\an8}<i>Fa-la-la-la-la-la-la-la</i>

121
00:07:58,812 --> 00:08:00,147
Excuse me, sir.

122
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,191
Hey, Margo. I was just avoiding you.

123
00:08:02,274 --> 00:08:03,817
Yes, sir. I get it.

124
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:07,029
But, you know, it is my job
to review your file after each haunt.

125
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:11,742
So, you have been eligible for retirement
for 46 seasons.

126
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,578
- Yeah.
- And you're still here.

127
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,913
Like, all the time.

128
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:18,415
Well, I believe the work we do here
is very important.

129
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,542
Yeah.
But don't you want another crack at life?

130
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,836
God, I miss drinking.

131
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,214
I used to go so hard
with my girls back in Tampa.

132
00:08:25,297 --> 00:08:26,715
Wait, aren't you in HR?

133
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,675
I have a tramp stamp
on the front and the back.

134
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,053
We were crazy.
We stole a cruise ship one time.

135
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,639
Look, HR, I don't know
if that's the right area for you...

136
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:34,722
Figgy pudding.

137
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:36,225
Wh... I'm sorry, what?

138
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:38,602
It says in your file
that you liked figgy pudding.

139
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,437
Don't you wanna try it again?

140
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,649
Don't you wanna go back on Earth
and do person stuff again?

141
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,067
Yeah, I guess so.

142
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,570
I mean, I died
before there was indoor plumbing, so I...

143
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:51,657
Well,
it's been fun chatting and everything,

144
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:55,077
but, there's, like,
a whole party going on, so…

145
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,120
Okay, but I feel like
you started the conversation.

146
00:08:57,204 --> 00:09:00,749
Anyway, 46 seasons. Crazy.

147
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,670
Just saying. Maybe it's time.

148
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,509
Maybe she has a point.

149
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:14,263
<i>Is it time to find out if I'm</i>

150
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:18,475
<i>Meant for more
Than just a Christmas morning feeling?</i>

151
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:22,604
<i>I could go back to Earth
Retire, just peace out</i>

152
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:26,525
<i>Another chance at the life
I've been dreaming about</i>

153
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,116
Maybe I buy
a quaint little house on a quiet street.

154
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,078
I meet a nice gal,
and we get married and start a family.

155
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:40,664
{\an8}And then,
at the end of each day after work,

156
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:46,628
{\an8}we have a loving embrace and one of
those newfangled, modern mouth kisses.

157
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:48,630
That'd be nice.

158
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:53,594
<i>Is it time to find out if I'm</i>

159
00:09:53,677 --> 00:09:57,890
<i>Ready to reach beyond
A Christmas morning feeling?</i>

160
00:09:58,515 --> 00:10:02,019
<i>To be human again, alive once more</i>

161
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:06,190
<i>Take some swings
At the things I missed out on before</i>

162
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,860
And there's me in the backyard

163
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:13,030
goofing around with my two kids
who share the same first initial.

164
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:17,326
Little Rebecca and her brother,
Reggie or Robert or...

165
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,289
Rar... I don't know.
I'll think of a good "R" name.

166
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:32,799
<i>But what if I screw up my life again
Like I did the first time through</i>

167
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:36,178
<i>Could I really be someone better</i>

168
00:10:36,261 --> 00:10:40,182
<i>Someone kinder, someone new?</i>

169
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:41,975
<i>But no, no, no</i>

170
00:10:42,059 --> 00:10:45,729
<i>I've gotta make more
Of a difference here</i>

171
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,273
<i>There's so much left to do</i>

172
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:51,985
<i>With all the trolls
And a-holes out there</i>

173
00:10:52,069 --> 00:10:55,322
<i>Well, am I doing the world
A world of good?</i>

174
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:59,201
<i>And have I given it my all?</i>

175
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:03,205
<i>Or am I just full of it?</i>

176
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:06,583
<i>Am I just full of sh...</i>

177
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:10,379
Hey. Come on now, potty mouth.

178
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:13,382
Bit inappropriate for the day.

179
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:16,552
I know, old friend.

180
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,139
This is just your usual
post-haunt comedown, yeah?

181
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,850
It's more than that, Jacob.

182
00:11:25,602 --> 00:11:26,770
Look at this place, mate.

183
00:11:28,981 --> 00:11:34,403
Every single one of them's a soul
that we've redeemed. Together.

184
00:11:36,613 --> 00:11:38,532
So, fret not, sunshine.

185
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:41,410
For in two weeks' time,
we scout next season's perp,

186
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:43,370
and I've seen the file on this one.

187
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,582
- Manages a fancy hotel in Vancouver.
- Uh-huh?

188
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,668
Right vile little bastard.
You're gonna love him.

189
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,462
Just what you need
to get back up on that horse.

190
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:55,966
So, come on now.
Stiff upper. Big-boy pants.

191
00:12:05,017 --> 00:12:10,314
Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey, hey. You.

192
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,774
- Walter.
- No one cares what your name is,

193
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,736
and no one should have a mustache
on their lip and forehead.

194
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,197
Why are you crossing
through my grand lobby?

195
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,241
These Christmas Tree conventioners
pay top dollar to be here,

196
00:12:21,325 --> 00:12:23,702
so they don't have to look at
or think about people like you,

197
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,370
you walking plunger.

198
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,831
So, did I tell you?

199
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:31,502
Abusive, stingy, self-centered.

200
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:34,796
I like that he goes
against the Canadian stereotype.

201
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,424
Yeah. It's weird to see a Canadian
without mittens.

202
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:42,262
I mean, yeah.
He's an absolute turd in a suit. Right?

203
00:12:42,346 --> 00:12:44,890
But, I'm just wondering... Hear me out.

204
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:46,767
This guy... And he's terrible...

205
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,522
But if we change him, does he create
enough ripples to make a real difference?

206
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,066
- That's all I'm saying.
- Make a real difference?

207
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,944
Four-hundred people work for him.

208
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,529
Bit sad, isn't it?

209
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:01,532
Disgruntled, yeah?
Taking it out on their kids.

210
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:04,076
Yes, Senator.
It's designed to be offensive.

211
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,828
Outrage is a drug.

212
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:10,082
Listen to me,
the second you tweet that word,

213
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:13,460
CNN is no longer talking about
how you just boned the teachers' union.

214
00:13:13,544 --> 00:13:16,922
Trust me, Senator. Post it.

215
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,976
I don't know.

216
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:35,774
Our guest today
manages PR for AT&T and the NFL.

217
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,777
He's helped senators, governors,
even presidents get elected.

218
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:42,197
All due respect, Marty,
we're on our butts here.

219
00:13:42,698 --> 00:13:46,159
This trade group can't afford to hire
some fancy New York media consultant.

220
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:48,620
Got that right.

221
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,040
Here he is.
Let's give him a real good welcome.

222
00:13:52,124 --> 00:13:54,626
From the Briggs Media Group, Clint Briggs.

223
00:13:55,711 --> 00:13:58,505
Thank you, Marty. Always a pleasure.

224
00:13:58,589 --> 00:13:59,715
And it is true,

225
00:13:59,798 --> 00:14:03,051
I do charge comically enormous fees,

226
00:14:03,135 --> 00:14:05,888
which will probably bankrupt
your entire organization,

227
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,848
but, you know, last week,

228
00:14:07,931 --> 00:14:12,394
over 300 million families
took down their Christmas trees.

229
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:17,608
Eighty-one percent of which were fake,
plastic trees.

230
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,026
Yeah.

231
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:22,654
I don't know why you're acting surprised.
I hit one button on Amazon,

232
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,825
and a shiny, new tree is on my porch
by the end of the afternoon.

233
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,493
Easy-peasy.

234
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:34,333
Yeah. People,
they used to insist on authenticity.

235
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:37,127
Have people changed?
Now, that's the good news.

236
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:41,381
Now, people never change.
But you know something?

237
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:47,387
Real trees are trending downward.
Your sales continue slipping.

238
00:14:47,888 --> 00:14:52,768
<i>They destroyed your bottom lines
With plastic pines and same-day shipping</i>

239
00:14:54,144 --> 00:14:56,021
Well, you've got the better product.

240
00:14:56,522 --> 00:15:01,527
<i>But if you wanna win
You gotta study human nature</i>

241
00:15:02,361 --> 00:15:06,490
<i>All those interested, lean in</i>

242
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,453
<i>People are, one, lazy</i>

243
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:13,539
<i>We only care about ourselves</i>

244
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,543
<i>Your competition knows this
So their crap flies off the shelves</i>

245
00:15:17,626 --> 00:15:22,631
<i>But we're also, two, desperate
To feel good and smart and right</i>

246
00:15:23,215 --> 00:15:27,261
<i>And that's what you have to harness
If you wanna win this fight</i>

247
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:31,682
<i>See, what you're really selling
Is the way things ought to be</i>

248
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:36,144
<i>So your pitch becomes compelling
Selling more than just a tree</i>

249
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:40,858
<i>It's a symbol of your values
It's your ethics and your cause</i>

250
00:15:40,941 --> 00:15:43,777
<i>You can either be fake
Like the trees they make</i>

251
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:47,656
<i>Or take a stand for Santa Claus</i>

252
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:52,077
<i>We're bringing back Christmas
We're bringing back cheer</i>

253
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,955
<i>We're bringing back cozy nights
Those twinkly lights</i>

254
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:56,582
<i>The glow of yesteryear</i>

255
00:15:56,665 --> 00:16:00,961
<i>Now, it's some slight manipulation
But it's what we've gotta do</i>

256
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:06,175
<i>See, we need some confrontation
Or your message won't get through</i>

257
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:12,264
<i>We're bringing back decency
We're bringing back Christmas</i>

258
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:16,143
<i>And that means the piney scent
Of a real authentic tree</i>

259
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,313
They're literally eating out of his hand.

260
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:24,193
<i>It would be, sure, simple
To boost your market share</i>

261
00:16:24,276 --> 00:16:28,614
<i>We'd rebrand you as nostalgic
Tell your customers you care</i>

262
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:33,327
<i>But the world is, what? Tribal
So if you want your sales to soar</i>

263
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:37,831
<i>It's not enough for folks to love you
They gotta hate your rivals more</i>

264
00:16:37,915 --> 00:16:42,211
<i>As an expert my advice is
Feed that hate, 'cause hate is strong</i>

265
00:16:42,294 --> 00:16:46,673
<i>Folks will gladly pay your prices
To prove those Christmas-killers wrong</i>

266
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:50,552
<i>We're bringing back Christmas</i>

267
00:16:50,636 --> 00:16:53,472
<i>-And all the joy that we've lost
-We're bringing it back</i>

268
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:56,183
<i>Give me some peace on Earth
A virgin birth</i>

269
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,851
<i>And grandpa getting sauced</i>

270
00:16:57,935 --> 00:16:58,852
Wow!

271
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:02,981
<i>Every Facebook-loving boomer
Wants to fight a culture war</i>

272
00:17:03,065 --> 00:17:06,984
<i>So tell your core consumer
What the hell they're fighting for</i>

273
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,365
<i>A fight for morality
A fight for morality</i>

274
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,617
<i>We're bringing back Christmas</i>

275
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,329
<i>And it's not coming back
With some manufactured tree</i>

276
00:17:17,412 --> 00:17:19,248
I want a complete breakdown on him.

277
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:22,125
I'm talking a living tree
in your living room.

278
00:17:22,626 --> 00:17:25,753
As I reach up to place the angel on top,

279
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:31,385
I look out my window and I see
my neighbor, Doug, across the street,

280
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:34,304
snapping together his artificial tree.

281
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,933
He's like the perfect combination
of Mussolini and Sea crest.

282
00:17:38,517 --> 00:17:42,437
Easy-peasy, poor, lazy, deplorable Doug,

283
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:47,818
who cares more about convenience than
the happiness and respect of his town,

284
00:17:48,318 --> 00:17:51,071
of his country, of our sacred holiday!

Clint Briggs.
Grew up in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

286
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,617
{\an8}Middle child of three to a single mother.

287
00:17:55,701 --> 00:17:58,078
His older sister, Carrie,
passed away five years ago.

288
00:17:58,161 --> 00:18:01,248
Her daughter, Wren, is now being raised
by Clint's younger brother, Owen.

289
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,501
Clint's company specializes
in creating controversy, conflict,

290
00:18:04,585 --> 00:18:07,546
and disinformation
for the benefit of his clients worldwide.

291
00:18:08,714 --> 00:18:11,800
Oh, my God. He's perfect.

292
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:18,223
It's not enough to want it.
You gotta get mad. You have to fight.

293
00:18:18,307 --> 00:18:21,643
You have to fight for the traditions
we hold dear.

294
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:23,103
So persuasive.

295
00:18:24,104 --> 00:18:27,482
Kinda makes you wanna push
an old lady down a flight of stairs.

00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:45,626
<i>Plus a ton of cash</i>

302
00:18:45,709 --> 00:18:49,213
<i>From some good old-fashioned trees</i>

303
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,964
<i>The cozy glow of yesteryear</i>

304
00:18:51,048 --> 00:18:53,050
<i>All those twinkly lights
And all the cheer</i>

305
00:18:53,133 --> 00:18:55,677
<i>We're bringing back Christmas
We're bringing back Christmas</i>

306
00:18:58,388 --> 00:18:59,765
Thank you.

307
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:07,814
Yeah!

308
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:09,024
Yes!

309
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,692
That's our man.

310
00:19:11,985 --> 00:19:14,363
I'm sorry, this is not our man.

311
00:19:14,446 --> 00:19:17,157
Wait. What? Hold on. Why not?

312
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:20,452
Jacob, the guy causes division for a job.

313
00:19:21,036 --> 00:19:22,955
- And he's...
- Insanely hot.

314
00:19:24,581 --> 00:19:26,333
Is that not what you were gonna say?

315
00:19:28,418 --> 00:19:29,837
What? I've been dead for 40 years,

316
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,005
and I'm not made of wood.
The man's attractive.

317
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,091
- No, he's smoking hot.
- Smoking hot.

318
00:19:34,174 --> 00:19:37,261
And more importantly,
he's got his hands all over everything.

319
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:38,679
Yeah. I wish.

320
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,390
- Maude, are you texting HR?
- No.

321
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:45,644
Jacob, I'm telling you. He could be
our greatest haunt ever. The whale.

322
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:48,355
If we change him, imagine the ripples.

323
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,072
Great.

324
00:19:58,031 --> 00:20:00,701
That is a flagrant breach
of established protocol.

325
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:03,495
So, we're stuck with creepy,
convention boss guy, then?

326
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,747
Yep. No hot-girl Christmas for you.

327
00:20:05,831 --> 00:20:07,207
Okay. Hang on.

328
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,836
He's not an unredeemable
because he drowns puppies.

329
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:14,298
He's only stamped because he's
"dogmatically committed to the belief

330
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:15,841
that people never change."

331
00:20:15,924 --> 00:20:18,218
"Never change"?
Now I do want a piece of this guy.

332
00:20:18,302 --> 00:20:21,013
Jacob, I'm telling you.
I know what makes this guy tick.

333
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,348
We won't fail. Come on.
I can take this guy.

334
00:20:24,892 --> 00:20:27,895
Besides, you know it's been done before.

335
00:20:27,978 --> 00:20:32,441
Once. Barely.
And you know that was different.

336
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:34,693
- What did he say?
- But with the state the world is in now,

337
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:38,655
I'm not about to risk a whole year
of ripples on a lost cause. I'm sorry.

338
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:41,200
We go with the rat-bastard hotel manager.

339
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:46,246
In that case, I would like to collect
my retirement package.

340
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:48,957
He said retire.

341
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:52,377
- Wait, you can't retire.
- Now, settle down, spirits.

342
00:20:53,378 --> 00:20:55,797
- He's bluffing.
- Sorry, did you say retire?

343
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,299
Do I look like I'm bluffing?

344
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:01,053
Actually, you do. Yes.

345
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,431
All right, then.

346
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:14,107
All you have to do is take it
and you're retired.

347
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:15,984
Back on Earth.

348
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:20,197
Living, breathing and offering opinions
on things you know nothing about.

349
00:21:20,697 --> 00:21:22,699
Right. Earth.

350
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,206
You know what?
We don't have to do this right now.

351
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:32,709
There is no shame in your dedication
to the betterment of mankind.

352
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:35,254
- Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Jacob, please.

353
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,965
I can't explain it,
but if I could just change this guy,

354
00:21:38,048 --> 00:21:40,592
- maybe I'll...
- What? Maybe you'll what?

355
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:44,972
Oh, no. No. There's no need
for a whole big number here. No.

356
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:48,308
No spotlight. Gary, kill the spot...

357
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,601
<i>Every day I wake up</i>

358
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:52,980
<i>With a single dream
Running through my head</i>

359
00:21:53,063 --> 00:21:55,732
Look, I have another meeting
I'm actually late for.

360
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:59,194
<i>To throw a tiny stone
Into a mighty stream</i>

361
00:21:59,278 --> 00:22:01,488
<i>And watch the ripples as they spread</i>

362
00:22:01,572 --> 00:22:04,449
Redeeming an unredeemable
is nearly impossible.

363
00:22:05,742 --> 00:22:11,748
But if you'll promise to stop singing,
you can have your perp.

364
00:22:13,792 --> 00:22:17,254
Really? Great. Thank you.
That's quite reasonable.

365
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,716
Thanks, Gary. We're good.
You were right on the cue.

366
00:22:21,258 --> 00:22:23,260
Guys, he said yes. Let's get to work.

367
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,469
Yes!

368
00:22:24,553 --> 00:22:26,388
Do you wanna hear the rest of my song?

369
00:22:28,056 --> 00:22:32,811
<i>And so it begins.
A full year of research and preparation.</i>

370
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:41,862
{\an8}<i>Painstakingly recreating
one man's past, present and future.</i>

371
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,035
{\an8}<i>Why do we work so hard?
We do it for the ripples.</i>

372
00:22:50,329 --> 00:22:51,705
Damn!

373
00:22:51,788 --> 00:22:53,248
<i>See, it's a documented fact</i>

374
00:22:53,332 --> 00:22:56,627
{\an8}<i>that one person's kindness
can have a ripple effect.</i>

375
00:22:57,753 --> 00:22:59,671
<i>Spreading goodwill like a pandemic...</i>

376
00:22:59,755 --> 00:23:01,215
<i>No. Scratch that. Sorry.</i>

377
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,508
{\an8}<i>You know, like...</i>

378
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:07,179
{\an8}<i>You know when people at a football stadium
do the wave? Like that. More like that.</i>

379
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:16,355
{\an8}<i>Now, finally,
I have a perp with global reach.</i>

380
00:23:20,442 --> 00:23:22,694
{\an8}<i>If we can redeem this unredeemable,</i>

381
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:26,657
<i>imagine just how far
these ripples could go.</i>

382
00:23:29,785 --> 00:23:32,079
{\an8}Briggs Media Group. One moment please.

383
00:23:32,162 --> 00:23:35,999
{\an8}<i>Watch how far the ripples go</i>

384
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:39,044
<i>Watch how far the ripples go</i>

385
00:23:39,127 --> 00:23:40,546
<i>Go</i>

386
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:45,425
<i>Ripple
Look how far the ripples go</i>

387
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:49,763
{\an8}Okay. The Billie Eilish-
Ed Sheeran beef has been approved

388
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:51,473
{\an8}by management on both sides.

389
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,769
Ed will post the insensitive comment
on Tuesday and then apologize on Sunday.

390
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:59,231
Okay, let's push the apology back
to the day of the VMAs to maximize buzz.

391
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,525
And your niece is here.

392
00:24:02,025 --> 00:24:05,904
Apparently, she'd like your help with
something, but Owen didn't say what it is.

393
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:07,823
She get the phone I sent?

394
00:24:08,407 --> 00:24:09,408
Hoverboard?

395
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:12,035
It's just...
I got a really busy day going here.

396
00:24:12,911 --> 00:24:13,996
No problem.

397
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,790
I'll just go tell your late sister's
only kid you're too busy.

398
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:20,627
Top-notch guilt trip, Kimberly.

399
00:24:20,711 --> 00:24:23,672
The way you emphasize "late."
Proud of you.

400
00:24:25,632 --> 00:24:27,009
So, Uncle Clint,

401
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:31,597
I was thinking that maybe I would run
for Student Council President.

402
00:24:34,349 --> 00:24:38,395
So, maybe you could help me. Something.

403
00:24:38,478 --> 00:24:41,690
Wow. That's... I mean, you know, that
requires someone who's very...

404
00:24:42,399 --> 00:24:46,153
You've always struck me as someone who's
more of an inside-voice type of person.

405
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:49,656
So, what makes you want to run
for Student Council President?

406
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,744
- Go ahead.
- Well, I think I can make the school

407
00:24:53,827 --> 00:24:54,995
- way better…
- 100%.

408
00:24:55,078 --> 00:24:56,079
…If they pick me.

409
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,624
- But they probably won't.
- Probably not.

410
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,835
- 'Cause Josh Hubbins is running, so…
- Josh Hubbins?

411
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:03,754
Jo... He sounds like a,

412
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,380
- you know, a legend at…
- Yeah.

413
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:06,507
…whatever school you go to.

414
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,676
Never mind. It was a stupid idea.
I'm sorry.

415
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,928
I shouldn't have bothered you.

416
00:25:11,011 --> 00:25:12,888
It's all right.
I have bad ideas sometimes.

417
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:16,558
Clint, you promised Carrie if Wren
ever needed anything, you would help her.

418
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,936
- You remember that?
- Yes. Yes, I remember. I…

419
00:25:25,442 --> 00:25:27,569
You've already won. You already won.

420
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:31,198
Hey. Come here. Sit. Sit, please.

421
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:34,284
You got this in the bag,
but you're gonna get your hands dirty.

422
00:25:34,368 --> 00:25:36,662
You're gonna say and do things
that you will not be proud of.

423
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:37,746
Hey, wait a minute, Clint...

424
00:25:37,829 --> 00:25:40,666
Please hold your indignation,
'cause it's gonna get worse.

425
00:25:40,749 --> 00:25:44,002
So, this Josh Hubbins,
what are his grades like?

426
00:25:44,086 --> 00:25:45,420
He gets straight A's.

427
00:25:46,004 --> 00:25:47,631
- So do I.
- Yeah. That's good for him,

428
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,800
- but for you, I prefer C's.
- She's never gotten less than...

429
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,135
I would love a D in there,
so you're gonna tank your midterms,

430
00:25:52,219 --> 00:25:54,304
you're gonna bank some detentions,
and boom.

431
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:57,516
You're a woman of the people.
We cast Josh as a snot-nosed elite.

432
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:58,433
You get?

433
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:01,395
I don't know about this,
'cause he's actually super nice.

434
00:26:01,478 --> 00:26:04,940
- Yeah, he's a great kid, really.
- Okay. I will put you over my knee.

435
00:26:05,023 --> 00:26:07,067
And his parents have their own non-profit.

436
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,194
Trust me, he's hiding something.
Everybody is.

437
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:12,155
Kimberly's gonna do some oppo research.
That means digging up dirt.

438
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:17,953
And Kimberly is the best.
She is a stone-cold killer.

439
00:26:18,495 --> 00:26:20,914
Opposition research on an eighth-grader?

440
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,541
Sure.

441
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,711
- Okay.
- You hungry? You want a juice box?

442
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,212
- I'm okay.
- Want a Negroni?

443
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:29,381
You know what? I'm just gonna stay on her,

444
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:33,218
just in case this turns into an important
story thread that we may wanna follow.

445
00:26:33,302 --> 00:26:34,887
Well, okay.

446
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:37,890
Yeah, I'm gonna stay and watch him
put ponytail man over his knee.

447
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,101
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

448
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:45,981
Boy, we have similar jobs, don't we?
Digging up dirt on people.

449
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,234
What do we have here?

450
00:26:49,735 --> 00:26:53,989
<i>When your parents make you eat Christmas
dinner with homeless people. Gross.</i>

451
00:26:54,072 --> 00:26:56,992
Oh, Josh. What did you post?

452
00:26:57,951 --> 00:27:01,747
You're sunk, kiddo. You are so sunk.

453
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:07,794
I'm doing oppo research on a child.

454
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:19,431
<i>The big corner office
The 12-person team</i>

455
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:23,101
<i>A slick leather chair
The American Dream</i>

456
00:27:23,185 --> 00:27:26,563
<i>My mom used to clean
Ritzy places like these</i>

457
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:31,276
<i>With their overpriced art
And their walls of degrees</i>

458
00:27:31,818 --> 00:27:35,447
<i>Well, now it's all mine
With my name on the door</i>

459
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:39,368
<i>A big, fancy desk on the 38th floor</i>

460
00:27:39,451 --> 00:27:45,249
<i>Look at the girl who did right
At the height of a hard-won career</i>

461
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:50,379
<i>What could surpass
Giant windows of glass</i>

462
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,422
<i>Framing miles of blue</i>

463
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,385
<i>That's the view from here</i>

464
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:02,266
<i>That's the view from here</i>

465
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:06,562
<i>They say, "Climb the ladder
No matter the cost"</i>

466
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:10,566
<i>But nobody tells you
How much can get lost</i>

467
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:14,027
<i>That decent and hopeful
Young woman you were</i>

468
00:28:14,111 --> 00:28:17,197
<i>Well, you wake up one day
And you wonder</i>

469
00:28:17,865 --> 00:28:19,741
<i>"What happened to her?"</i>

470
00:28:20,951 --> 00:28:24,663
<i>That woman was made
To see good in each heart</i>

471
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:28,250
<i>But now she gets paid
To pull people apart</i>

472
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:35,007
<i>And, I mean, hey, look at me
MVP, employee of the year</i>

473
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:39,761
<i>Well, maybe I guess
That this looks like success</i>

474
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:41,930
<i>But it doesn't feel true</i>

475
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:45,809
<i>That's the view from here</i>

476
00:28:48,061 --> 00:28:51,356
<i>That's the view from here</i>

477
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,450
<i>I could keep doing oppo
Keep digging up dirt</i>

478
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:05,537
<i>Pretend I don't care
When nice people get hurt</i>

479
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:09,374
<i>Block out the guilt
That I'd have to ignore</i>

480
00:29:09,458 --> 00:29:14,713
<i>For a raise as I rise
To the 39th floor</i>

481
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:22,596
<i>Or I can walk out this door
And defiantly quit</i>

482
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:26,058
<i>There's a line you can't cross
And I think this is it</i>

483
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:30,020
<i>Maybe I haven't lost sight
Of what's right</i>

484
00:29:30,103 --> 00:29:33,815
<i>No, it's perfectly clear</i>

485
00:29:35,025 --> 00:29:37,528
- That was quick.
- Go ahead. Tell him how you feel.

486
00:29:38,737 --> 00:29:40,030
You found something good, didn't you?

487
00:29:40,113 --> 00:29:44,368
See, you can always tell by
the self-loathing expression on her face.

488
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,704
- Well, actually…
- Yeah. Come on. You can do it.

489
00:29:47,788 --> 00:29:48,830
…I came here…

490
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:51,583
To say you quit your job,
but you want ample severance.

491
00:29:52,668 --> 00:29:56,046
- …to say, I…
- Yeah.

492
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,967
…found something that should do the trick.

493
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:03,220
Yes, you did. Let's go see. Come on.

494
00:30:06,473 --> 00:30:10,853
<i>At the end of the day
Words are easy to say</i>

495
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,481
<i>But it looks like the walking away</i>

496
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:17,484
<i>Is a little bit harder to do</i>

497
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:21,864
<i>That's the view</i>

498
00:30:23,574 --> 00:30:24,908
<i>From here</i>

499
00:30:37,296 --> 00:30:41,049
Well, Josh's family runs a Christmas Day
dinner at a homeless shelter.

500
00:30:41,133 --> 00:30:43,302
He'll be humble bragging
the crap out of that.

501
00:30:43,385 --> 00:30:48,473
But, two years ago, he posted
and quickly deleted this on TikTok.

502
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:49,516
<i>When your parents</i>

503
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,352
<i>make you eat Christmas dinner
with homeless people. Gross.</i>

504
00:30:54,605 --> 00:30:56,190
I am outraged.

505
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:58,150
I told you Kimberly was the best.

506
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,694
Once Josh is done trumpeting
his annual good deed, Wrenny,

507
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,323
you post that video, start writing your
acceptance speech, and Bob's your uncle.

508
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:06,491
- Actually, I'm your uncle, so…
- This is two years ago.

509
00:31:06,575 --> 00:31:09,494
- Time to go.
- He's a kid. He's in sixth grade.

510
00:31:09,578 --> 00:31:12,247
Wait, Clint, please. Can we just hang on
and talk about this for a second?

511
00:31:12,331 --> 00:31:15,626
We only get one elevator a day.
So, let's catch this one. Bye, guys.

512
00:31:16,502 --> 00:31:17,920
- Like ya.
- Do it again.

513
00:31:18,003 --> 00:31:19,254
Yeah.

514
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:25,594
It's official. I'm a terrible person.

515
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:28,180
No, you're not.

516
00:31:32,518 --> 00:31:33,519
Excuse me?

517
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,065
What? Can she see you right now?

518
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:39,441
Have we met?

519
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,109
Can she see me?

520
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,611
Hey!

521
00:31:44,154 --> 00:31:45,989
- This is crazy.
- I don't think so.

522
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:47,074
No.

523
00:31:47,157 --> 00:31:50,035
Well, then how do you know
how terrible I may or may not be?

524
00:31:50,118 --> 00:31:51,578
Why can she see you?

525
00:31:51,662 --> 00:31:52,913
I don't know.

526
00:31:54,331 --> 00:31:56,834
Well, I've always been
a good judge of character.

527
00:31:56,917 --> 00:32:00,462
- It's kinda baked into my job.
- Do you work here?

528
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:02,881
- We have to kill her now, right?
- No!

529
00:32:04,258 --> 00:32:06,385
I'm here on a project.

530
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:08,345
- For Briggs?
- What are you doing?

531
00:32:08,428 --> 00:32:10,347
Well, it involves Mr. Briggs.

532
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:12,891
Get out of this.
You're going to get us in trouble.

533
00:32:12,975 --> 00:32:14,268
Really? Which project?

534
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:16,436
Make something up. Make something up.
Abort.

535
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,731
- I'm The Ghost of Christmas Present.
- What are you doing?

536
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,568
Yeah,
we'll be haunting him this Christmas,

537
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:25,279
- in hopes we can change him into being…
- You got to be kidding me.

538
00:32:25,362 --> 00:32:27,155
…a more positive force for humanity.

539
00:32:28,991 --> 00:32:30,284
Clint?

540
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:32,911
Clint. Yeah.

541
00:32:37,291 --> 00:32:38,292
I'm Kimberly.

542
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:54,016
Roberto.

543
00:32:54,892 --> 00:32:56,351
C. Fishman.

544
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:58,812
Pratt. Roberto C. Fishman Pratt.

545
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,984
Well. Thanks for the laugh, Roberto.

546
00:33:04,693 --> 00:33:08,739
And the compliment.
I needed both of them right about now.

547
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,074
Like the outfit.

548
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:13,452
Thank you.

549
00:33:16,622 --> 00:33:20,584
You know, I think deep down, you wanted
her to see you because you're into her.

550
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:22,085
I'm not into her.

551
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:24,004
Roberto C. Fishman Pratt?

552
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:26,757
- Okay, it's a bad name!
- It's too many names.

553
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:29,218
And as if we didn't have enough

554
00:33:29,301 --> 00:33:30,511
to fight about at Christmas dinner,

555
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:34,223
the kind of Christmas tree you have
is now a battle on social media.

556
00:33:34,973 --> 00:33:37,017
It is. Lots of anger on both sides.

557
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:40,812
Apparently, if you have a real tree,
you're a judgmental elitist hipster.

558
00:33:42,105 --> 00:33:43,190
But if you have a fake tree,

559
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:46,527
you're an enemy of Santa Claus,
Jesus, and Mariah Carey. And that's...

560
00:33:47,694 --> 00:33:49,863
You don't wanna
bring out Mariah's bad side.

561
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:54,451
Hey. I'm watching it right now.

562
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:57,746
Yeah.
Let's have our influencers hit it hard.

563
00:33:57,829 --> 00:34:00,749
#ChristmasTreeWar. And remind Wren...

564
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,376
Rafi, these are amazing.

565
00:34:02,459 --> 00:34:04,169
Remind Wren not to post the video
of the kid

566
00:34:04,253 --> 00:34:05,963
until after he posts
from the homeless shelter...

567
00:34:06,046 --> 00:34:07,047
Holy bejeebus.

568
00:34:09,049 --> 00:34:10,342
The suit is amazing.

569
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,594
Wow, Beth.

570
00:34:21,853 --> 00:34:22,855
Are you guys…

571
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,192
Beth?

572
00:34:47,212 --> 00:34:50,090
Oh, damn. That's not good.

573
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:53,467
All right,
whoever's filming me, I'm impressed.

574
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:58,515
Oh, Jesus!

575
00:34:59,224 --> 00:35:05,063
This chain I forged in life
is girded of my own free will.

576
00:35:05,564 --> 00:35:08,942
Link by link
with each soul I made to suffer.

577
00:35:09,026 --> 00:35:11,987
Very convincing. Okay, who...

578
00:35:15,449 --> 00:35:16,909
Oh, f...

579
00:35:16,992 --> 00:35:20,078
<i>Ye shall find no sleep tonight</i>

580
00:35:20,162 --> 00:35:21,538
Okay, I'm dreaming.

581
00:35:21,622 --> 00:35:25,083
<i>No, this is not a dream</i>

582
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,460
God, you're ugly.

583
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:30,088
<i>Many wrongs have ye to right</i>

584
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:34,259
<i>Dark deeds ye must redeem</i>

585
00:35:34,343 --> 00:35:37,095
You keep singing, I'm gonna stand up.

586
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:41,391
<i>Your past, your present
And your future</i>

587
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,685
<i>Ye shall soon behold</i>

588
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:45,312
This is very, very weird.

589
00:35:45,395 --> 00:35:49,858
<i>The story of your life</i>

590
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:52,194
<i>Shall now</i>

591
00:35:52,778 --> 00:35:56,823
<i>Unfold</i>

592
00:36:00,077 --> 00:36:01,495
Feel my chain!

593
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:03,580
Can I not?

594
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:11,588
<i>The story of your life
The truth you're scared to hear</i>

595
00:36:11,672 --> 00:36:12,673
I...

596
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:16,677
<i>The story of your life
A tale of reckoning and fear</i>

597
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,763
I just have one thing you really need to...

598
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,807
I'm so sorry.

599
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:24,101
I'm stuck on the first thing there.

600
00:36:24,184 --> 00:36:26,103
The... You said, "Past, present, future."

601
00:36:27,271 --> 00:36:29,815
Like <i>A Christmas Carol</i>? The Dickens story?

602
00:36:29,898 --> 00:36:31,525
The Bill Murray movie
with Bobcat Goldthwait?

603
00:36:31,608 --> 00:36:34,862
Yes. Like the Dickens book
and the Bill Murray movie

604
00:36:34,945 --> 00:36:36,905
and every other adaptation
nobody asked for.

605
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:39,950
Now, please, if you would just
let me get this out. Sit.

606
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,034
Here?

607
00:36:41,702 --> 00:36:42,703
Okay.

608
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:50,002
<i>You might rewrite</i>

609
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:53,839
<i>The story of your life</i>

610
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:56,049
<i>Before it's all too late</i>

611
00:36:58,385 --> 00:36:59,636
What is it?

612
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,972
Again, I'm so sorry.

613
00:37:02,639 --> 00:37:04,474
So, out of all the people on the planet...

614
00:37:04,558 --> 00:37:09,021
Murderers, racists,
people who do gender-reveal parties...

615
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:10,689
I'm the guy you're gonna haunt?

616
00:37:10,772 --> 00:37:12,858
If you would shut up and let me finish,
you might understand...

617
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:14,818
- Yes, sir.
- You know what?

618
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,070
Forget it. It's not worth the trouble.

619
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:18,655
Three ghosts coming to save you.

620
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:21,783
Bit more consideration for them
than you did for me maybe, yeah?

621
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,410
- Noted.
- Good. All right, then. Cheers.

622
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:37,758
I told you.
The guy is a level 20 pain in the ass.

623
00:37:40,594 --> 00:37:41,595
You got this.

624
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:43,263
Yeah. No sweat.

625
00:37:43,347 --> 00:37:45,098
All right, team, last looks. I'm going in.

626
00:37:45,182 --> 00:37:47,851
Go get 'em, girl. Knock 'em dead.

627
00:37:59,905 --> 00:38:01,490
Oh, come on.

628
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:26,056
Hello, Mr. Briggs.

629
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:29,351
I'm The Ghost of Christmas Past.
Your past.

630
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:32,479
Hi. Wow.

631
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:36,400
Good. You're not what I was expecting.

632
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:38,318
No? How so?

633
00:38:38,402 --> 00:38:39,987
I mean, you're lovely.

634
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,905
Yeah, I know.

635
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:48,120
- But still, it is nice to hear it.
- I bet.

636
00:38:48,954 --> 00:38:53,041
Thank you. But we should just...
We should go.

637
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:56,086
I just... If you don't mind...
Would you mind if I have a quick shower?

638
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:58,589
- I just would love to freshen up a skosh...
- Shower? Right now?

639
00:38:58,672 --> 00:39:01,341
The last ghost was a little musky,
and I touched his chain.

640
00:39:02,676 --> 00:39:08,599
Yeah. Then definitely.
You should shower if you're feeling dirty.

641
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:11,226
- Thank you. Okay.
- Well, no.

642
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,895
I mean, wait. No.

643
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:16,106
We should just...
We have to go. There's a lot to see.

644
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,232
Right. Of course. Yeah.

645
00:39:18,358 --> 00:39:20,861
Soft. Jinx.

646
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:22,654
Owe me a beer.

647
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:27,117
- Yeah. We should go.
- Yeah.

648
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:35,751
Hey, Chief.

649
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:38,003
- You got a sec?
- Yeah. What's up?

650
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:41,548
Look, man. I'm tired
of being just the guy who points at stuff.

651
00:39:41,632 --> 00:39:45,469
Right. Well, look, hey,
I wouldn't underestimate the pointing.

652
00:39:45,552 --> 00:39:46,845
- Yeah.
- I mean, the way you do it,

653
00:39:46,929 --> 00:39:48,597
it's chilling. Hit me with it again.

654
00:39:49,306 --> 00:39:50,432
Boom!

655
00:39:50,516 --> 00:39:52,601
Okay. You're very good at it.

656
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:56,313
Yeah, I appreciate that, but I've got
some catchphrases I wanna try out.

657
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,773
Check these out.

658
00:39:57,856 --> 00:40:01,485
"Welcome to the bone zone."
"Bone appétit."

659
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:05,239
Or my favorite,
"You've been Christmas Caroled, bitch."

660
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:06,532
I don't know what to say.

661
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:09,576
Every year during the haunt,
you try to talk and nothing comes out.

662
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:11,745
Yeah, and why is that? It's just not...

663
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:14,331
Dude, it's not up to him.
He doesn't make the rules.

664
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:17,000
Excuse me. Why aren't you on the haunt?

665
00:40:17,084 --> 00:40:20,546
Yeah. Well, get a load of this.

666
00:40:20,629 --> 00:40:21,672
Yeah, I'm waiting.

667
00:40:21,755 --> 00:40:24,383
So, flying him back
to his childhood in Minneapolis.

668
00:40:24,466 --> 00:40:26,176
- Uh-huh.
- And he's holding my hand.

669
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:29,304
And he can't help himself,
he starts flirting with me.

670
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:32,349
One thing led to another, and you know.

671
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,018
Please tell me you're kidding.

672
00:40:35,102 --> 00:40:37,187
- I am…
- Okay.

673
00:40:37,271 --> 00:40:38,146
…not kidding.

674
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:39,398
- What?
- I know.

675
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:42,442
- Here we go.
- It was unprofessional, but, you know,

676
00:40:42,526 --> 00:40:45,487
it's been a very long time since
anyone's tried to get up in my beeswax.

677
00:40:45,571 --> 00:40:48,156
So, Mama did something for herself
for a change.

678
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,660
Okay. Well, did Mama consider the stakes?
He's an unredeemable!

679
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,370
He redeemed himself a little bit.

680
00:40:53,453 --> 00:40:55,247
- Good for you!
- Just saying.

681
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,125
Okay. Now I feel like he's judging me.

682
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:00,794
No, I'm not judging you.

683
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:04,214
I don't even know what to think.
Hold on. Where is he now?

684
00:41:04,298 --> 00:41:07,843
He's fine. He's in his
childhood bedroom in the '80s.

685
00:41:07,926 --> 00:41:09,178
We'll talk about this later.

686
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:11,805
I need you to get back out there
and take him through his past.

687
00:41:11,889 --> 00:41:15,350
Right. Yes, okay. But, hey,
could you do it? Cover my shift?

688
00:41:15,434 --> 00:41:19,313
I mean, I feel like it's gonna
be awkward. He's really into me.

689
00:41:29,823 --> 00:41:30,824
All right.

690
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:33,911
Don't you come back
with the same story she did.

691
00:41:46,590 --> 00:41:48,634
My Alex P. Keaton action figure.

692
00:41:49,593 --> 00:41:52,679
Hey, ghost girl.

693
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,224
When I was a kid, this thing...

694
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,477
Hello, Mr. Briggs.

695
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:02,814
Hello. Where's the other one?
Are you also a...

696
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:10,739
Wow. This dream makes zero sense.

697
00:42:10,822 --> 00:42:12,407
This is not a dream, Mr. Briggs.

698
00:42:12,491 --> 00:42:14,701
- And can you stop touching my face?
- For sure.

699
00:42:14,785 --> 00:42:16,119
I'm your Ghost of Christmas Present.

700
00:42:16,203 --> 00:42:19,206
Present? What are you doing in my past?

701
00:42:19,289 --> 00:42:20,707
See? Dream.

702
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,711
Well, your haunt got off
to a bit of a "humpy" start.

703
00:42:24,795 --> 00:42:26,088
Yes, it did.

704
00:42:27,172 --> 00:42:30,133
So, I will be handling both past
and present this evening.

705
00:42:30,217 --> 00:42:31,385
- Of course.
- This isn't my usual gig,

706
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,804
so I just need to get a lay of the land,
if you don't mind?

707
00:42:33,887 --> 00:42:35,264
Sure.

708
00:42:36,765 --> 00:42:39,268
Yeah. This should do. Okay.

709
00:42:40,477 --> 00:42:41,979
Hey, I'm haunting you.

710
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:46,066
You can't just run away from me
when I'm haunting you. Hello?

711
00:42:47,401 --> 00:42:48,861
- Hey, hotshot…
- Geez.

712
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:51,697
…you know, it's totally understandable
if you're scared

713
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,782
that you won't be able
to defend your choices.

714
00:42:55,284 --> 00:43:00,080
- Look, Colonel Sanders…
- I haunted him, yes.

715
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:03,292
The proper way
to do that technique is, you...

716
00:43:06,670 --> 00:43:09,298
<i>Am I right? I said, am I right?</i>

717
00:43:10,007 --> 00:43:11,633
- Carrie.
- Carrie!

718
00:43:11,717 --> 00:43:14,428
- Mom said we can open one present tonight.
- Cool.

719
00:43:14,511 --> 00:43:16,722
Let's start with that green one.

720
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:19,933
You got me a puppy?

721
00:43:20,017 --> 00:43:22,686
You've only been asking me for a puppy
for about, what, a thousand years?

722
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:23,812
Where is he?

723
00:43:24,563 --> 00:43:25,898
He's sleeping in the kitchen.

724
00:43:25,981 --> 00:43:28,901
- Sparky?
- Sparky?

725
00:43:29,526 --> 00:43:31,028
Oh, Clinty, wait till you see him.

726
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:35,032
He's got the most adorable
little white paws and... Oh, my God.

727
00:43:35,115 --> 00:43:37,951
How many times have I told you to close
this kitchen door when you come back in?

728
00:43:38,035 --> 00:43:41,371
If it doesn't click when you close it,
then it lets all the heat out,

729
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:44,082
and apparently,
adorable little puppies too.

730
00:43:44,166 --> 00:43:46,376
Oh, geez, this is a Christmas tragedy.

731
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,754
Clint, no, she's lying.

732
00:43:48,837 --> 00:43:50,088
There is no puppy.

733
00:43:50,172 --> 00:43:53,050
She got you a dog dish
to make you think that there was a puppy.

734
00:43:53,759 --> 00:43:54,760
That's ridiculous.

735
00:43:54,843 --> 00:43:56,428
Then why aren't we looking for it?

736
00:43:56,512 --> 00:43:59,431
You know, if you spent a nickel on it,
we would be out looking all night.

737
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:01,391
That is it.

738
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:04,269
You're ruining Christmas!

739
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:07,940
Yeah, you keep on running, missy.

740
00:44:08,899 --> 00:44:10,234
Hey, where do you think you're going?

741
00:44:10,817 --> 00:44:14,071
Sparky?

742
00:44:14,154 --> 00:44:15,489
I see it now.

743
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,410
- Sparky?
- I see the...

744
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:22,162
I see the...

745
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:28,210
The chain of events that led me to be
the monster that I am.

746
00:44:30,546 --> 00:44:33,215
- Sorry. That was too much.
- You're faking. Very nice.

747
00:44:33,298 --> 00:44:38,011
What do you expect when you misread
the situation so egregiously?

748
00:44:38,095 --> 00:44:41,723
That was the single best Christmas gift
that she or anyone else has ever given me.

749
00:44:41,807 --> 00:44:44,768
Hold on. A lie about a nonexistent puppy?

750
00:44:44,852 --> 00:44:45,769
No.

751
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:49,940
The solid-gold lesson that people will
believe anything if they wanna believe it.

752
00:44:50,023 --> 00:44:52,025
I wanted a puppy so bad

753
00:44:52,109 --> 00:44:55,362
that it was better to believe
I had a lost dog than no dog at all.

754
00:44:55,445 --> 00:44:59,491
That lesson made me so rich,
I could buy a million puppies.

755
00:44:59,575 --> 00:45:03,203
Plus I never left the door open again,
so you know, win-win.

756
00:45:03,287 --> 00:45:04,538
Okay, smarty-pants.

757
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:09,543
- Thank you.
- No.

758
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:14,173
- That's not for you. It's for her.
- Who's her?

759
00:45:15,424 --> 00:45:20,053
Yeah, I heard of this.
It's where people use that...

760
00:45:20,137 --> 00:45:22,764
- That pound or ha shy thing, right?
- Yeah. Yep, I'm telling you,

761
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:25,559
a year from now,
this is gonna be on all of your phones.

762
00:45:25,642 --> 00:45:26,643
I don't know.

763
00:45:26,727 --> 00:45:29,479
Do people really wanna talk about
everything they've ever done

764
00:45:29,563 --> 00:45:32,524
- with every idiot they've ever met?
- Yes. Yes, they do, new girl.

765
00:45:32,608 --> 00:45:34,067
- They really do.
- Really? It's Nora.

766
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:38,906
Nora. Yes, every thought, every meal.

767
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:40,324
Boy, that Nora was a keeper.

768
00:45:41,533 --> 00:45:42,868
Wonder how it all works out with her.

769
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:48,707
Ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas.

770
00:45:49,374 --> 00:45:50,709
Ho, ho, ho.

771
00:45:51,293 --> 00:45:53,086
Good. Christmas shopping.

772
00:45:53,170 --> 00:45:54,630
- Hey, that's Clint right there.
- Hey, Clint.

773
00:45:54,713 --> 00:45:56,298
- Hi, Nora.
- Hi.

774
00:45:56,381 --> 00:45:57,674
Oh, my God, I love your boots.

775
00:45:58,800 --> 00:45:59,885
-Hey
-Hey, Owen.

776
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:02,763
I'm sorry.
The level of detail is astounding.

777
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:05,224
Is that a Sephora?

778
00:46:07,226 --> 00:46:09,019
- Yeah.
- Those didn't exist.

779
00:46:09,102 --> 00:46:11,021
Good eye. Yeah, that wasn't here.

780
00:46:11,647 --> 00:46:12,981
We have a deal with them.

781
00:46:13,065 --> 00:46:15,025
There's my baby boy.

782
00:46:15,108 --> 00:46:16,443
Mom invited herself, so…

783
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:17,861
- Here we...
- Hi, hon.

784
00:46:18,362 --> 00:46:20,280
Good, you're drunk.
Well, it's 8 a.m. somewhere.

785
00:46:20,364 --> 00:46:21,740
God, I used to love this mall.

786
00:46:21,823 --> 00:46:22,824
Hey.

787
00:46:23,325 --> 00:46:25,244
And I see you brought
this one again. Very lovely.

788
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:27,704
- It's nice to see you, Wendy.
- Yeah, I'll bet it is.

789
00:46:27,788 --> 00:46:29,998
Hey,
if anyone's looking for a gift for me…

790
00:46:30,082 --> 00:46:31,500
What?

791
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:32,876
- Shut up.
- What?

792
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:36,296
I'm gonna be an uncle?
Uncle Owen? Like <i>Star Wars</i>?

793
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,090
Oh, my God. That's amazing.

794
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:41,635
- What? How? With who?
- With me.

795
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:44,096
I'm done waiting around for a good man.
I want a baby.

796
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:46,723
So I went to a clinic
and all I know about the daddy

797
00:46:46,807 --> 00:46:50,477
is that he's getting his master's
in marine biology and I helped pay for it.

798
00:46:51,478 --> 00:46:53,146
I love sea turtles.

799
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,233
- I get knocked up on Thursday.
- Congratulations.

800
00:46:57,317 --> 00:46:59,987
Honey. Aren't you happy for your sister?

801
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:01,488
No. Not really, no.

802
00:47:01,572 --> 00:47:02,906
Come on, Clint.

803
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:07,286
Come on, Carrie. I love you,
but you have no clue how to be a mom.

804
00:47:07,369 --> 00:47:10,038
- Come on, dude. Not cool, man.
- What are you talking about?

805
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:12,541
Your sister was always really good to you,
wasn't she?

806
00:47:12,624 --> 00:47:14,168
It's okay. I understand how he feels.

807
00:47:14,251 --> 00:47:15,085
- I really do.
- See?

808
00:47:15,169 --> 00:47:18,755
Okay, I don't. You are incapable
of putting anyone ahead of yourself

809
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:21,049
and I'm... Oh, my God, I'm so done with it.

810
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:23,427
No. Nora. Hey. Come on.

811
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:24,720
- Don't do this. Don't. Come on.
- You know what?

812
00:47:24,803 --> 00:47:25,929
Hey, it's Christmas. It's Christmas.

813
00:47:26,013 --> 00:47:27,890
It's my fault, all right?

814
00:47:27,973 --> 00:47:33,604
I thought that I could change you
and only a fool would think that. Goodbye.

815
00:47:36,356 --> 00:47:37,649
All right. Bye, hon.

816
00:47:37,733 --> 00:47:40,068
- Suck it, Wendy.
- Okay, you too.

817
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:43,572
You know... So I was a little pigheaded.
Weren't you ever in your 20s?

818
00:47:44,072 --> 00:47:45,073
It's not about me.

819
00:47:46,325 --> 00:47:49,453
You know what? Why not?
Why isn't it about you?

820
00:47:49,536 --> 00:47:51,830
I don't get to know anything
about my accusers?

821
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,049
Hey. You watching this?

822
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:04,635
{\an8}<i>Senator, will you be resigning?</i>

823
00:48:04,718 --> 00:48:06,553
Clint, you fabricated a scandal.

824
00:48:06,637 --> 00:48:07,596
<i>La, la, la, la</i>

825
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:10,307
I'm not watching
your dramatic "reencrapment"

826
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:11,850
until you tell me something about you.

827
00:48:11,934 --> 00:48:13,644
- You're acting like a child.
- I can't hear you.

828
00:48:13,727 --> 00:48:15,771
It's not crappy either.

829
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:19,733
- It's very accurate. Hold CPM-104, please.
- I can't hear you.

830
00:48:20,234 --> 00:48:21,401
All right.

831
00:48:21,902 --> 00:48:22,903
Nice.

832
00:48:23,695 --> 00:48:25,989
I'll answer one question about me.

833
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:27,324
Okay, five questions.

834
00:48:27,991 --> 00:48:29,618
- Two.
- Eight. Final offer.

835
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:33,914
But we'll close at three. Okay.
Question one, were you ever alive?

836
00:48:35,374 --> 00:48:36,375
- Yes.
- When?

837
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:39,628
Well, I've been dead nearly two centuries.

838
00:48:39,711 --> 00:48:41,755
What? Oh, my God.

839
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,757
And you've been doing the same job
the whole time?

840
00:48:43,841 --> 00:48:47,511
No. No, I was…
First ten seasons, I was in research.

841
00:48:48,887 --> 00:48:51,723
- And then our GC Present retired.
- GC?

842
00:48:51,807 --> 00:48:53,684
- GC... Ghost of Christmas Present…
- Ghost...

843
00:48:53,767 --> 00:48:57,354
- Yeah. Of course.
- …retired, and…

844
00:48:58,397 --> 00:49:00,482
- I was called up to the show.
- Oh, my God.

845
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:02,109
You know that first save?

846
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,528
- Incredible rush.
- Huge.

847
00:49:05,028 --> 00:49:06,572
Felt like
I was really making a difference.

848
00:49:07,447 --> 00:49:10,742
Was making a difference.
But you're not anymore?

849
00:49:13,203 --> 00:49:15,330
Okay, you know what?
I've answered your three questions.

850
00:49:15,414 --> 00:49:16,790
And you just answered my fourth.

851
00:49:16,874 --> 00:49:19,585
Why do you feel like that
you're not making a difference anymore?

852
00:49:19,668 --> 00:49:22,337
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Me?

853
00:49:22,421 --> 00:49:25,549
I have never once had to put up
with this level of bullshit from a perp.

854
00:49:25,632 --> 00:49:29,052
- A perp?
- We are walking around in your past.

855
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:31,972
Most people are too freaked out
to crawl up my ass

856
00:49:32,055 --> 00:49:34,975
with a bunch of stupid,
irrelevant questions.

857
00:49:35,058 --> 00:49:38,896
Stop it. Shut your dumb face
and just watch the scene.

858
00:49:39,897 --> 00:49:41,565
Resume CPM-104, please.

859
00:49:42,191 --> 00:49:45,027
Clint, you fabricated a scandal.

860
00:49:45,110 --> 00:49:46,361
I didn't fabricate...

861
00:49:46,445 --> 00:49:51,283
I suggested a scandal
that the public and the media ran with.

862
00:49:51,366 --> 00:49:54,369
- And it's gonna get our client elected.
- You destroyed that woman's life.

863
00:49:55,412 --> 00:49:57,331
We talked about these tactics.

864
00:49:58,248 --> 00:49:59,708
I didn't build this company

865
00:49:59,791 --> 00:50:01,919
so I wouldn't be able to look my kids
in the eye.

866
00:50:02,503 --> 00:50:05,297
Okay, I have put this off
long enough, but...

867
00:50:06,798 --> 00:50:07,925
Are you about to fire me?

868
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:12,429
Clint, you're the brightest guy I know.
You're gonna land on your feet.

869
00:50:13,347 --> 00:50:18,018
No, I'm not gonna land on my feet,
Dan, I'm gonna land on you.

870
00:50:18,101 --> 00:50:19,937
When I take all of your clients with me.

871
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:21,772
You have a non compete clause.

872
00:50:21,855 --> 00:50:23,524
Which you will not enforce

873
00:50:23,607 --> 00:50:28,904
because you so fear what I can do
using these tactics which are beneath you.

874
00:50:30,322 --> 00:50:31,532
Merry Christmas, Dan.

875
00:50:33,575 --> 00:50:37,371
He built this company with honor
and integrity, and you destroyed it.

876
00:50:38,330 --> 00:50:39,831
Well done. Come on.

877
00:50:39,915 --> 00:50:43,252
Now hold on a second. Wait.

878
00:50:43,335 --> 00:50:46,129
You're taking me all out of context.
Wait, watch what happens next.

879
00:50:46,213 --> 00:50:48,590
Hey, Kimberly. I'm starting my own firm.

880
00:50:48,674 --> 00:50:50,843
I see greatness in you,
and it's being squandered here.

881
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:53,262
I'm gonna make you an executive VP,
I will double your salary,

882
00:50:53,345 --> 00:50:56,682
but you gotta decide right now,
are you in or are you out?

883
00:50:58,392 --> 00:50:59,685
I...

884
00:51:03,021 --> 00:51:04,648
I guess I'm in.

885
00:51:04,731 --> 00:51:08,068
Great. Grab your coat.
Let's go build a dream.

886
00:51:08,694 --> 00:51:11,321
Nobody gives you credit for that, do they?
Believing in people.

887
00:51:11,405 --> 00:51:13,448
- Helping them live their best life.
- Best life?

888
00:51:13,532 --> 00:51:14,658
- Yes.
- Is that what you think?

889
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:15,742
- 100%.
- All right.

890
00:51:15,826 --> 00:51:17,202
You know what?

891
00:51:17,286 --> 00:51:20,414
Can you cue up DS-261
from a couple days ago?

892
00:51:20,497 --> 00:51:21,748
261? I cut that part.

893
00:51:21,832 --> 00:51:25,335
I realize it's a deleted scene.
I'm calling an audible. Okay, Bonnie?

894
00:51:25,419 --> 00:51:28,547
All right. God.
Has he said anything about me?

895
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:31,091
- No.
- Okay, but, like, what's his vibe?

896
00:51:31,175 --> 00:51:32,509
I have no idea.

897
00:51:32,593 --> 00:51:34,845
Right. I know this is gonna sound weird,
but trust me,

898
00:51:34,928 --> 00:51:37,890
- it's strictly business.
- <i>What?</i>

899
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:40,684
Can you smell his hair
and describe it to me?

900
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:41,727
No.

901
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,979
Hi. This is Margo from HR.

902
00:51:44,062 --> 00:51:47,733
I just wanna say,
everything is HR approved, totally okay.

903
00:51:47,816 --> 00:51:53,030
- Just go ahead with whatever you wanna do.
- Fine. Cotton candy.

904
00:51:53,614 --> 00:51:55,908
Oh, my God. That's so sexy.

905
00:51:55,991 --> 00:51:58,994
Now can you re-cue the scene, please?

906
00:51:59,077 --> 00:52:02,497
<i>Right. 261 coming at ya.
Audible, I remember.</i>

907
00:52:03,207 --> 00:52:06,293
So this boy Wren's running against,
Josh Hubbins?

908
00:52:06,376 --> 00:52:09,129
Well,
Josh's family runs a Christmas Day dinner

909
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:11,298
- at a homeless shelter…
- This was, like, two days ago.

910
00:52:11,381 --> 00:52:12,925
I mean, I remember what ha...

911
00:52:13,008 --> 00:52:14,927
…quickly deleted this on TikTok.

912
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,095
<i>When your parents
make you eat Christmas dinner</i>

913
00:52:17,179 --> 00:52:19,097
<i>with homeless people. Gross.</i>

914
00:52:21,099 --> 00:52:24,853
I am outraged.
I told you Kimberly was the best.

915
00:52:24,937 --> 00:52:27,481
Once Josh is done trumpeting
his annual good deed, Wrenny,

916
00:52:27,564 --> 00:52:30,275
you post that video,
start writing your acceptance speech,

917
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:31,485
and Bob's your uncle.

918
00:52:31,568 --> 00:52:33,153
Okay, you're right.

919
00:52:33,237 --> 00:52:34,696
I mean, he's just a kid…

920
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,240
Do I regret saying, "Bob's your uncle"?

921
00:52:36,323 --> 00:52:38,700
Yeah, I do. But I made the choice,
and I gotta live with it.

922
00:52:38,784 --> 00:52:41,787
Look, I just ask that you respect me
and my family's privacy.

923
00:52:44,748 --> 00:52:45,749
What happened?

924
00:52:47,084 --> 00:52:50,212
What was that? My face is burning.

925
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:55,259
- Can we slow down and talk about...
- Can't believe we get one elevator a day.

926
00:52:55,342 --> 00:52:58,512
Gotta catch this one. Bye, guys. Like ya.

927
00:52:58,595 --> 00:53:01,390
See? Now, does that look like
someone who's living her best life?

928
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:05,561
It's official. I'm a terrible person.

929
00:53:06,061 --> 00:53:07,187
No, you're not.

930
00:53:08,605 --> 00:53:09,731
Excuse me?

931
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:12,276
Hold on a second. What? Wait. Hold on.

932
00:53:12,359 --> 00:53:14,069
- Hold on 261.
- Have we met?

933
00:53:14,152 --> 00:53:16,822
We're all good.
Yep, make it go away. Thank you.

934
00:53:16,905 --> 00:53:19,658
What were you doing in this?
How was she talking to you?

935
00:53:21,034 --> 00:53:22,119
I don't know.

936
00:53:22,202 --> 00:53:25,622
I was scouting you,
and then she looked right at me.

937
00:53:25,706 --> 00:53:30,002
And we just...
We just started talking, and it's...

938
00:53:30,544 --> 00:53:31,837
Actually, never mind.

939
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:34,923
The point is that Kimberly's
a really good person, all right?

940
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:37,134
- And you're just...
- Are you allowed to interfere

941
00:53:37,217 --> 00:53:39,803
- in the lives of the people that you...
- I'm trying to show the effect

942
00:53:39,887 --> 00:53:41,722
- your choices have...
- Not really answering my question.

943
00:53:41,805 --> 00:53:44,183
- I'm done dicking around with you, pal.
- Wow, sugar mouth.

944
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:49,771
- Cue up CPM-163. Yes. Now.
- Not CPM-163, no.

945
00:53:50,272 --> 00:53:51,440
No. I can't...

946
00:54:06,121 --> 00:54:07,664
Hey, guys.

947
00:54:07,748 --> 00:54:09,583
Hey, Wrenny. Look what Uncle Clint got ya.

948
00:54:10,167 --> 00:54:11,418
- Cool.
- Yeah.

949
00:54:11,502 --> 00:54:14,129
Mom, can I donate it to the sick kids?

950
00:54:14,213 --> 00:54:16,006
That would be really nice, sweetheart.

951
00:54:16,089 --> 00:54:19,134
- There's a bin down in the lobby, okay?
- Yeah, give it away. Glad we wrapped it.

952
00:54:19,218 --> 00:54:21,553
It's next to the teddy bear, okay?
Have Martha help you.

953
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:25,265
Well, you're certainly looking brighter
than you were before.

954
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:28,727
Clint, don't.
Before she comes back, listen.

955
00:54:29,937 --> 00:54:31,730
It's time that I made some arrangements.

956
00:54:32,689 --> 00:54:35,776
Okay... Stop it.

957
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:37,611
I need to ask you a favor.

958
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,530
And it's a doozy.

959
00:54:40,322 --> 00:54:42,407
- No, we're not doing this.
- When I'm gone...

960
00:54:42,491 --> 00:54:43,784
No.

961
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:45,953
- This is a key moment... Mr. Briggs.
- No...

962
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,622
Mr. Briggs!

963
00:54:48,705 --> 00:54:49,665
We got a runner!

964
00:54:52,459 --> 00:54:53,585
We got a runner!

965
00:55:00,634 --> 00:55:01,927
What are you so afraid of?

966
00:55:03,011 --> 00:55:06,390
I'm afraid of you
telling her to tank her grades.

967
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:09,059
And hurt another kid.
And she's listening to you.

968
00:55:09,142 --> 00:55:12,229
I never said
this was gonna be the easy way.

969
00:55:12,312 --> 00:55:14,815
She wanted to win.
And that means you have to play hardball.

970
00:55:14,898 --> 00:55:16,984
Yes, Clint, but she has a good heart…

971
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:19,152
<i>Señor, por favor.</i>

972
00:55:20,529 --> 00:55:22,406
<i>No. Señor.</i>

973
00:55:22,906 --> 00:55:23,907
<i>Señor!</i>

974
00:55:36,837 --> 00:55:37,963
We've got a breach.

975
00:55:38,630 --> 00:55:42,968
- Mr. Briggs.
- <i>Non.</i>

976
00:55:43,552 --> 00:55:44,887
<i>Je ne peux parler français. Non.</i>

977
00:55:46,013 --> 00:55:47,639
<i>Je m'excuse.</i>

978
00:55:57,941 --> 00:55:58,942
Nuts.

979
00:56:06,158 --> 00:56:08,202
Everything's cool. Back to work, everyone!

980
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,885
Hey, that memory in the hospital.

981
00:56:24,968 --> 00:56:27,846
That's what we call a kicker.

982
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:32,309
It's a key moment
that has to be faced in order to,

983
00:56:32,392 --> 00:56:33,727
you know, effect any real change.

984
00:56:33,810 --> 00:56:37,439
What are all these pictures
of my executive VP doing up here?

985
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:39,608
Just, you know, research.

986
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:41,318
Did you Photoshop yourself into this one?

987
00:56:42,486 --> 00:56:45,906
- Did I? I don't think so.
- You did.

988
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:49,701
Look,
I may have pushed you into your kicker,

989
00:56:50,452 --> 00:56:52,287
you know,
before you were really ready for it.

990
00:56:52,371 --> 00:56:55,457
And I just wanna say… I'm sorry.

991
00:56:55,541 --> 00:56:57,709
Oh, no. I'm sure that you gotta go big

992
00:56:57,793 --> 00:57:00,504
if you're trying to redeem
an unredeemable.

993
00:57:07,052 --> 00:57:10,806
Listen… That doesn't have to be true.

994
00:57:11,473 --> 00:57:16,353
Does it? I really believe
you can be a positive force for mankind.

995
00:57:16,436 --> 00:57:19,064
Like you? How's that going for ya?

996
00:57:19,815 --> 00:57:21,900
You've been at this 200 years.

997
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,696
Is mankind getting any man-kinder?

998
00:57:27,906 --> 00:57:30,617
More genial? United?

999
00:57:33,328 --> 00:57:37,040
Wanna know what mankind really is?
Read the comments below.

1000
00:57:39,251 --> 00:57:42,337
That's who we really are.
And you know what, I accept that.

1001
00:57:43,338 --> 00:57:45,007
'Cause I gotta live in it, pal.

1002
00:57:45,090 --> 00:57:47,217
I don't have the luxury
of sitting up here,

1003
00:57:47,301 --> 00:57:50,095
judging everybody
like some kind of cosmic social worker.

1004
00:57:52,055 --> 00:57:56,935
- Is that what you think I am?
- Yes, I do. And we are done here.

1005
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:16,079
What? What's with the dramatic look? You...

1006
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:19,541
Do you think I'm gonna be all intrigued
by what's behind the door? I...

1007
00:58:20,918 --> 00:58:21,919
Forget it.

1008
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:24,963
Not even a little bit curious?

1009
00:58:25,464 --> 00:58:27,841
Actually, no. I'm really not.

1010
00:58:29,176 --> 00:58:31,345
- Clint?
- Yes?

1011
00:58:36,558 --> 00:58:41,063
- Clint! Let's go. Right now.
- Damn it.

1012
00:58:57,371 --> 00:58:58,372
This is yours.

1013
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:03,168
Come here, you little blighter!

1014
00:59:03,252 --> 00:59:05,379
You asked if I was ever alive.

1015
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:07,840
Yeah.

1016
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:09,800
What, the kid?

1017
00:59:10,843 --> 00:59:11,844
That's you?

1018
00:59:18,934 --> 00:59:20,310
Yes?

1019
00:59:20,394 --> 00:59:24,231
Mr. Scrooge, I'm Woodrow, sir.

1020
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:28,777
Well, I have nothing for you,
boy. So good afternoon.

1021
00:59:28,861 --> 00:59:31,405
There's no call
for that kind of language, sir.

1022
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:33,699
I said, good afternoon.

1023
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:37,202
Shame on you, sir.
Saying such a thing to a child.

1024
00:59:37,286 --> 00:59:39,162
A good afternoon to you, madam.

1025
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:43,041
So you're telling me the Dickens story is…

1026
00:59:43,125 --> 00:59:44,793
- Please, sir.
- …Is based on you?

1027
00:59:44,877 --> 00:59:46,420
- What is it, boy?
- Yeah.

1028
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:50,048
Me and my father work at the mill.
The one you just shut down.

1029
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:51,383
Yes. And?

1030
00:59:51,466 --> 00:59:53,594
The mill is still quite profitable, sir.

1031
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,762
But a thousand people
have been put out of work.

1032
00:59:56,263 --> 00:59:57,973
And at a time
they ought to be making merry.

1033
00:59:58,056 --> 01:00:00,517
Making merry? Humbug!

1034
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:03,478
When your father
fails to make his mortgage

1035
01:00:03,562 --> 01:00:05,522
and I buy your home for a pittance,

1036
01:00:05,606 --> 01:00:08,150
that will make me most merry indeed.

1037
01:00:08,233 --> 01:00:09,568
Good afternoon!

1038
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:16,950
Okay, yes. You were a huge dick.

1039
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:19,203
Wow.

1040
01:00:19,912 --> 01:00:22,748
The only other unredeemable
to go through the program.

1041
01:00:23,957 --> 01:00:26,126
So I do understand the weight you carry.

1042
01:00:28,045 --> 01:00:29,379
Sooner or later,

1043
01:00:30,756 --> 01:00:32,382
it becomes unbearable.

1044
01:00:48,023 --> 01:00:49,358
I don't think she can see us.

1045
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:52,152
Right.

1046
01:00:52,236 --> 01:00:53,237
Madam.

1047
01:00:54,488 --> 01:00:56,615
All right, then. Hold your horses.

1048
01:01:02,621 --> 01:01:03,455
Whatever.

1049
01:01:05,791 --> 01:01:07,000
There we go.

1050
01:01:07,084 --> 01:01:08,293
Thank you.

1051
01:01:08,377 --> 01:01:09,378
Cheers.

1052
01:01:11,421 --> 01:01:12,756
Oh, my God.

1053
01:01:14,049 --> 01:01:16,093
That is man piss.

1054
01:01:16,176 --> 01:01:17,553
- Isn't that nice?
- It's warm.

1055
01:01:17,636 --> 01:01:19,596
- It's almost hot.
- It's perfect.

1056
01:01:20,138 --> 01:01:24,810
So, I just wanna fully understand this.
You were Scrooge.

1057
01:01:25,978 --> 01:01:28,146
The ghost changed you,
but you never relapsed.

1058
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:30,899
The rest of your life,
not one single humbug ever again.

1059
01:01:31,441 --> 01:01:32,526
The rest of my life.

1060
01:01:32,609 --> 01:01:35,654
How long was it?
The rest of your life, I mean.

1061
01:01:35,737 --> 01:01:39,658
- Roughly three-and-a-half weeks.
- Years.

1062
01:01:40,242 --> 01:01:41,243
- What?
- Yeah.

1063
01:01:41,743 --> 01:01:42,953
- You're kidding?
- No.

1064
01:01:43,036 --> 01:01:44,371
- Really?
- Uh-huh. Yeah.

1065
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:51,211
Sorry. What finally did it?

1066
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:53,755
- Like, what got you?
- Nothing fancy.

1067
01:01:53,839 --> 01:01:57,176
The leading cause of death back then
was January.

1068
01:01:57,259 --> 01:01:58,260
No.

1069
01:02:02,264 --> 01:02:05,392
But how did you...
How did you even know that you changed?

1070
01:02:05,475 --> 01:02:08,854
I mean, you know, anybody
can be good for three weeks, right?

1071
01:02:08,937 --> 01:02:10,147
I mean...

1072
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:29,541
Hey,
why did all those people get offended?

1073
01:02:30,542 --> 01:02:32,586
You know, when you said, "Good afternoon"?

1074
01:02:34,296 --> 01:02:38,800
Well, in the 1800s,
"good afternoon" was a sick burn.

1075
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:43,138
- No.
- Yes. More or less meant "F you."

1076
01:02:43,222 --> 01:02:45,349
- Really?
- Extremely graphic.

1077
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,768
Yeah, why don't you try it?

1078
01:02:47,851 --> 01:02:50,896
You know, bust one out on somebody.
I think it'll make you feel better.

1079
01:02:50,979 --> 01:02:52,356
- No.
- None of this is real.

1080
01:02:52,439 --> 01:02:56,276
I... Clint, I appreciate
what you're trying to do, but I'm fine.

1081
01:03:00,864 --> 01:03:05,118
<i>Now, fellow, here you are
In a shitty British bar</i>

1082
01:03:05,202 --> 01:03:08,997
<i>With a frothy little frown
Upon your lips</i>

1083
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:12,125
<i>Another pint for me friend, extra warm</i>

1084
01:03:12,626 --> 01:03:14,253
Your accent blows.

1085
01:03:14,336 --> 01:03:17,548
Well, I beg to differ.

1086
01:03:19,258 --> 01:03:23,637
<i>As you're drowning in that ale
You're feeling like a fail</i>

1087
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,474
<i>You're sorrier
Than soggy fish and chips</i>

1088
01:03:28,100 --> 01:03:32,646
<i>But you don't have to sit and pout
Just let your inner Scrooge come out</i>

1089
01:03:32,729 --> 01:03:37,025
<i>'Cause why should any other jerk
Enjoy his day?</i>

1090
01:03:37,526 --> 01:03:42,239
<i>When ya down in the dumps
And need some cheering upsies</i>

1091
01:03:42,990 --> 01:03:46,326
<i>Turn and tap a hapless chap</i>

1092
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:50,497
<i>And sweetly say</i>

1093
01:03:52,583 --> 01:03:53,584
Good afternoon.

1094
01:03:54,126 --> 01:03:55,043
<i>Good afternoon</i>

1095
01:03:55,127 --> 01:03:55,961
Well, I never.

1096
01:03:56,044 --> 01:03:58,755
<i>Just let one fly
And you'll be smiling pretty soon</i>

1097
01:03:58,839 --> 01:04:00,591
<i>Like this Good afternoon</i>

1098
01:04:00,674 --> 01:04:02,843
- I beg your pardon?
- You pompous arse.

1099
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:06,763
<i>It's like "piss off"
But with a little touch of class</i>

1100
01:04:06,847 --> 01:04:10,184
<i>Oh, two little words
Can totally change a tune</i>

1101
01:04:10,267 --> 01:04:11,685
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon!

1102
01:04:11,768 --> 01:04:13,103
Good afternoon.

1103
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,064
Good afternoon.

1104
01:04:16,148 --> 01:04:17,232
I'm sensing no.

1105
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:25,324
<i>So you've done nothing wrong
In so very, very long</i>

1106
01:04:25,407 --> 01:04:27,784
<i>And I get
It's an important point of pride</i>

1107
01:04:27,868 --> 01:04:28,952
It's part of my job.

1108
01:04:29,036 --> 01:04:32,789
<i>But come on, now don't stay quiet
You know you wanna try it</i>

1109
01:04:32,873 --> 01:04:35,918
<i>Better to never let all of the bitter
Be bottled up inside</i>

1110
01:04:36,001 --> 01:04:39,546
Oi! Out of the road, dingus.

1111
01:04:41,548 --> 01:04:44,051
Oh, come on, bub.

1112
01:04:44,551 --> 01:04:48,013
He's got it coming. You know you want to.

1113
01:04:48,555 --> 01:04:52,184
Come on. It's right there.

1114
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:55,687
Just let it…

1115
01:04:56,772 --> 01:04:59,233

Cantankerous buffoon</i>

- Oh, my God. She's a national treasure.

- A word, please.
- Right, just…

Okay. Hear me out.
I know what you're gonna say.

1178
01:08:19,308 --> 01:08:21,059
But I was losing him, okay?

1179
01:08:21,143 --> 01:08:23,729
And I just thought if he could see
that I was an unredeemable too...

1180
01:08:23,812 --> 01:08:26,564
So, you thought it might be a fine idea

1181
01:08:26,648 --> 01:08:30,152
to take him on a little field trip
into your own past?

1182
01:08:31,153 --> 01:08:32,779
I should've made you take
your retirement package

01:08:32,863 --> 01:08:35,282
when you asked for it,
rather than risk everything

on this unredeemable.

1185
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:38,118
- No. Hey.
- No, of course not.

1186
01:08:38,202 --> 01:08:41,913
I may not be getting with your program,
but it's not for his lack of trying.

- This guy has been busting my balls.
- Back to bed, Mr. Briggs.

"Back to bed." I...

1189
01:08:47,627 --> 01:08:51,715
And you. From now on,
I want everything on script. Understand?

1190
01:08:51,798 --> 01:08:56,345
- Jacob, I was just trying...
- On script!

1191
01:08:57,429 --> 01:08:59,348
Okay. On script.

1192

Good afternoon.

1197
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:20,077
It wasn't me. I heard it too.
I don't know what that was.

01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:40,514

- Hey. First of all, love the look.

1200
01:09:40,596 --> 01:09:42,515
- Thank you. What do you want?
- GQ Santa.

1201
01:09:43,140 --> 01:09:45,769
That rumor about
artificial Christmas trees off-gassing.

1202
01:09:45,853 --> 01:09:46,854
- Right.
- Genius.

1203
01:09:46,937 --> 01:09:48,729
- Thank you.
- Brilliant. Look at this. It's trending.

1204
01:09:48,814 --> 01:09:49,814
That's... It's...

1205
01:09:50,314 --> 01:09:53,569
Will you excuse me? I'm gonna figure out
what the hell that's all about.

1206
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:55,654
What what's all about?

1207
01:09:59,157 --> 01:10:01,535
Come in and know me better, man.

1208
01:10:02,452 --> 01:10:05,289
What in the hell is this?

1209
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:09,084
- I am The Ghost of Christmas Present.
- Your boss chews you out

1210
01:10:09,168 --> 01:10:12,379
- and now you're going full Dickens on me?
- Look, I gotta go by the book now.

1211
01:10:12,462 --> 01:10:15,007
Can I have one of these? What do
they mean by your retirement package?

1212
01:10:15,090 --> 01:10:16,633
Clint, please.

1213
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:17,926
Why do you want to retire?

1214
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:20,846
I only threatened to retire as leverage

1215
01:10:20,929 --> 01:10:23,390
to get him to approve you
as this year's perp.

1216
01:10:23,473 --> 01:10:24,600
Retire to where?

1217
01:10:26,226 --> 01:10:27,728
Where does a ghost retire to?

1218
01:10:28,478 --> 01:10:31,607
For the last time, Mr. Briggs,
this isn't about me.

1219
01:10:32,107 --> 01:10:34,151
Now we're back to Mr. Briggs and a perp.

1220
01:10:34,234 --> 01:10:35,986
You know what,
I'm gonna get back to my guests.

1221
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:37,070
And you can stay up here

1222
01:10:37,154 --> 01:10:40,282
- in your giant toilet of food.
- No. Clint, Clinty. Hold on.

1223
01:10:40,365 --> 01:10:41,909
All right. If I tell you…

1224
01:10:42,910 --> 01:10:45,412
Will you cut the crap and just come along?

1225
01:10:45,495 --> 01:10:46,830
Sure.

1226
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:50,667
Fine. You're killing me.

1227
01:10:50,751 --> 01:10:51,960
Good.

1228
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:58,050
All right. My retirement package,
if I were to choose to collect it,

1229
01:10:58,133 --> 01:11:01,386
is a gold watch, a Sephora gift card,

1230
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:05,599
and the chance to return to Earth and
live out the rest of my life as a mortal.

1231
01:11:07,684 --> 01:11:08,810
And you want that.

1232
01:11:08,894 --> 01:11:13,065
You know, what I want is for you
to shut up and let me do my job.

1233
01:11:13,148 --> 01:11:14,274
That's what I want.

1234
01:11:14,858 --> 01:11:16,610
Great. Do your job.

1235
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:18,612
- Grab my hand.
- We're doing this?

1236
01:11:18,695 --> 01:11:20,697
We're doing it.
It's gonna be quite a ride.

1237
01:11:21,615 --> 01:11:22,991
Oh, my God.

1238
01:11:23,742 --> 01:11:24,826
Bonnie.

1239
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:28,372
Remember, the key word is "quite a ride."

1240
01:11:42,469 --> 01:11:45,514
Here we are. Our first stop.

1241
01:11:46,515 --> 01:11:48,475
We were just here.

1242
01:11:48,559 --> 01:11:51,270
Listen,
I have a whole department of people

1243
01:11:51,353 --> 01:11:53,021
who work very hard on these transitions.

1244
01:11:53,105 --> 01:11:55,732
Whatever. Doesn't matter.
I know exactly what's going on.

1245
01:11:56,233 --> 01:11:57,192
- Do you?
- Yes, I do.

1246
01:11:57,693 --> 01:12:01,280
I mean, I love Clint. He's great.
I consider him a friend.

1247
01:12:01,363 --> 01:12:02,990
See? A friend.

1248
01:12:03,824 --> 01:12:06,201
I mean, as much as anyone can be friends
with Clint.

1249
01:12:06,285 --> 01:12:08,287
Have you tried
telling him about your personal life?

1250
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:10,289
See how long it takes
for his eyes to glaze over.

1251
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:13,959
Oh, my God. They're shit-whispering me.

1252
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:16,170
Yes, they are shit-whispering you.

1253
01:12:16,253 --> 01:12:17,588
- You're talking about Clint?
- Yeah.

1254
01:12:17,671 --> 01:12:22,676
Yeah. He can be a little self-absorbed,
but here's the thing

1255
01:12:22,759 --> 01:12:24,303
that you guys should understand
about Clint.

1256
01:12:24,386 --> 01:12:27,389
As a kid, he was alone a lot.

1257
01:12:28,265 --> 01:12:30,893
And he learned
the only person that he could count on

1258
01:12:32,019 --> 01:12:33,020
was himself.

1259
01:12:33,604 --> 01:12:36,940
So, you know, don't be too hard on him.

1260
01:12:39,276 --> 01:12:41,403
He's good inside. I should know.
He's my big brother.

1261
01:12:42,070 --> 01:12:43,864
Wow. Yeah, I love him.

1262
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:47,409
Well, if it isn't
The Ghost of Christmas Present.

1263
01:12:47,492 --> 01:12:49,620
Kimberly, hey. Hi.

1264
01:12:49,703 --> 01:12:50,954
You must be here to haunt Clint.

1265
01:12:51,997 --> 01:12:54,333
So she can see you.
Does she know about all of this?

1266
01:12:54,416 --> 01:12:56,460
No. Not really.

1267
01:12:56,543 --> 01:13:01,006
- I love your costume. Rudolph.
- Thank you.

1268
01:13:01,089 --> 01:13:02,382
You look adorable.

1269
01:13:02,466 --> 01:13:04,301
Always with the compliments.

1270
01:13:05,052 --> 01:13:06,762
Now I'm actually kinda glad I came.

1271
01:13:07,304 --> 01:13:08,305
Yeah.

1272
01:13:11,099 --> 01:13:12,100
Me too.

1273
01:13:14,436 --> 01:13:17,856
I knew it. You let her see you
because you're into her.

1274
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:21,318
But, I mean, who throws a work party
on Christmas actual Eve?

1275
01:13:21,401 --> 01:13:22,819
Only Clint, right?

1276
01:13:22,903 --> 01:13:23,904
Son of a...

1277
01:13:23,987 --> 01:13:25,197
It's a power move.

1278
01:13:25,280 --> 01:13:28,033
Now you guys are shit-whispering me too.
Let's go. Come on. What's next?

1279
01:13:28,617 --> 01:13:30,786
Sorry. I was actually on my way out.

1280
01:13:30,869 --> 01:13:31,954
Yeah. Okay.

1281
01:13:32,037 --> 01:13:34,039
I thought
we were gonna do things by the book.

1282
01:13:34,957 --> 01:13:36,375
It was great seeing you, though.

1283
01:13:37,793 --> 01:13:38,794
Yeah.

1284
01:13:39,294 --> 01:13:40,212
You too.

1285
01:13:44,299 --> 01:13:46,718
- It's okay. Just the one tonight.
- Whoa!

1286
01:13:47,719 --> 01:13:48,929
Wow, I love it.

1287
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:51,640
Yeah. Ex-girlfriend, I get it.

1288
01:13:51,723 --> 01:13:53,475
- Family I could've had.
- Thanks, Mommy.

1289
01:13:53,559 --> 01:13:56,478
Honestly, I... I'm...
I'm really happy for Nora.

1290
01:13:57,688 --> 01:14:00,065
Why can't you just admit
that you let Kimberly see you?

1291
01:14:00,148 --> 01:14:02,150
I didn't let her see me. She just...

1292
01:14:02,234 --> 01:14:05,988
Oh, come on.
I see the way you look at her.

1293
01:14:06,905 --> 01:14:08,407
I really think that you wanna retire.

1294
01:14:08,490 --> 01:14:10,325
- You don't know me.
- You don't know you.

1295
01:14:10,409 --> 01:14:12,369
You think you're better off than that guy?

1296
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:16,665
- Thanks, honey.
- Look, you think this'll tempt me?

1297
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:20,002
Something cozy? Something stable?

1298
01:14:20,919 --> 01:14:23,755
Stuck on some suburban street with...

1299
01:14:23,839 --> 01:14:26,550
Is that meat loaf on the table?

1300
01:14:27,676 --> 01:14:29,678
<i>See, you'll claim this is my dream</i>

1301
01:14:30,262 --> 01:14:32,472
<i>But we both know that's not true</i>

1302
01:14:32,556 --> 01:14:35,225
<i>So let's shift the conversation</i>

1303
01:14:36,268 --> 01:14:37,811
<i>'Cause this dream</i>

1304
01:14:37,895 --> 01:14:41,231
<i>Belongs to you</i>

1305
01:14:45,027 --> 01:14:46,737
- Tear into 'em.
- Right?

1306
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:48,697
- You don't have to save the paper.
- Yeah.

1307
01:14:55,454 --> 01:14:56,288
Yeah,

1308
01:14:56,371 --> 01:15:00,667
or maybe I put the greater common good
above my own personal fulfillment.

1309
01:15:00,751 --> 01:15:02,503
But you wouldn't understand that,
would you?

1310
01:15:03,003 --> 01:15:06,798
So being human again would be
personally fulfilling for you, then?

1311
01:15:07,382 --> 01:15:11,345
<i>The story of your life
A whole new narrative</i>

1312
01:15:11,428 --> 01:15:13,138
- I'm tired.
- Me too.

1313
01:15:13,222 --> 01:15:17,851
<i>The story with the wife and kids
You clearly want to live</i>

1314
01:15:19,019 --> 01:15:24,149
<i>You almost had your shot at love
Until, you know, you died</i>

1315
01:15:24,816 --> 01:15:29,780
<i>But I can help you have it
Be your wing man, be your guide</i>

1316
01:15:30,364 --> 01:15:35,494
<i>You might rewrite
The story of your life</i>

1317
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,788
Have to make sure you're in bed
when Santa comes.

1318
01:15:37,871 --> 01:15:40,082
<i>The one you've been denied</i>

1319
01:15:40,165 --> 01:15:43,752
I could help you with Kimberly. I mean,
you guys were really vibing back there.

1320
01:15:44,628 --> 01:15:47,297
- Really? Do you really think so?
- Yes.

1321
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:50,217
- Her eyes are so adorable when she laughs.
- They are.

1322
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:53,637
Wait.
I know what you're trying to do. Come on.

1323
01:15:54,263 --> 01:15:56,056
All right, that's a firm grip. All right.

1324
01:15:56,139 --> 01:15:57,850
You're just extraordinary. You know that?

1325
01:15:57,933 --> 01:15:59,142
Are we going to Narnia?

1326
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:09,361
Wait. No. What are you doing?
What are y... Hey!

1327
01:16:09,444 --> 01:16:11,989
<i>The story of your life</i>

1328
01:16:12,489 --> 01:16:14,241
<i>The dream you dare to chase</i>

1329
01:16:14,324 --> 01:16:15,534
Get off the table, please.

1330
01:16:15,617 --> 01:16:20,789
<i>The story of your life
Watch the pieces all fall into place</i>

1331
01:16:20,873 --> 01:16:23,750
<i>You haven't felt a woman's touch
In so very...</i>

1332
01:16:23,834 --> 01:16:25,085
Stop it!

1333
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:27,045
Wha... Wow. Not a duet.

1334
01:16:27,129 --> 01:16:29,381
Are you five years old?
Get down from there.

1335
01:16:29,464 --> 01:16:31,383
- This is a homeless shelter.
- They can't see us.

1336
01:16:31,466 --> 01:16:33,385
- I'm trying to help you.
- I don't want your help.

1337
01:16:33,468 --> 01:16:37,181
I'm here to help you.
So stop it and pay attention.

1338
01:16:37,264 --> 01:16:40,017
Fine. Whatever.
Am I supposed to know this kid?

1339
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:41,727
- That's Josh Hubbins.
- Here you go. Merry Christmas.

1340
01:16:41,810 --> 01:16:43,520
Wren's opponent
for student body president.

1341
01:16:44,229 --> 01:16:47,316
Whose life you told your niece to cancel.

1342
01:16:47,399 --> 01:16:50,194
{\an8}I sent you a great pic.
You should post it.

1343
01:16:51,403 --> 01:16:53,030
{\an8}- Might be a vote-getter.
- Might not be.

1344
01:16:53,113 --> 01:16:56,325
{\an8}I don't know. I don't want people to think
I'm only doing this to win the election.

1345
01:16:56,408 --> 01:16:58,118
- Proud of you, buddy.
- Uh-huh.

1346
01:16:58,202 --> 01:16:59,661
But I think it'd be fine to post it.

1347
01:17:02,414 --> 01:17:06,668
See? He doesn't want to post about it.
Maybe he's a good, humble kid who just...

1348
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:08,712
And he posted it.

1349
01:17:08,795 --> 01:17:10,631
With a humblebrag. Shocking.

1350
01:17:10,714 --> 01:17:13,383
Wanna show me some more stuff
I'm right about? It's getting fun again.

1351
01:17:13,467 --> 01:17:14,343
- Quiet.
- Hey.

1352
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:16,261
You ever just stare in the mirror
and think,

1353
01:17:16,345 --> 01:17:18,555
- "Does this wreath make me look like a..."
- Okay. No more questions.

1354
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:20,015
- No more questions?
- No more questions. Wait here.

1355
01:17:20,098 --> 01:17:21,225
I'm just getting started with the quest...

1356
01:17:26,980 --> 01:17:28,357
That's just fun to watch.

1357
01:17:34,446 --> 01:17:37,741
Can you please tell Bonnie
or whoever's in charge of transitions

1358
01:17:37,824 --> 01:17:39,952
- that this is getting ridiculous?
- Uncle Owen.

1359
01:17:41,370 --> 01:17:42,996
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1360
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:45,499
How do you never get better at this?

1361
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:49,169
How are you so good at this?
We only do it once a year.

1362
01:17:49,253 --> 01:17:51,171
Your brother's such a good man.

1363
01:17:51,964 --> 01:17:53,507
- You want some cocoa?
- Sure.

1364
01:17:53,590 --> 01:17:55,217
You know I pay for everything, right?

1365
01:17:55,717 --> 01:17:56,718
You're gross.

1366
01:17:58,512 --> 01:17:59,513
Yeah, he is.

1367
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:03,100
All good.

1368
01:18:04,810 --> 01:18:07,604
Looks like Wren's trying to decide
whether to take her uncle's advice.

1369
01:18:07,688 --> 01:18:10,691
She's probably not even gonna post it
because she takes after my sister...

1370
01:18:10,774 --> 01:18:12,234
And she posted it.

1371
01:18:12,317 --> 01:18:14,528
You wanna see some more things
you're wrong about?

1372
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:18,574
You know, I'm happy for her. If you
wanna make your school a better place,

1373
01:18:18,657 --> 01:18:21,743
you're gonna have to accept
certain uncomfortable truths, and that's…

1374
01:18:44,016 --> 01:18:45,767
- Enjoy.
- Thank you, dear.

1375
01:18:50,397 --> 01:18:53,233
No. Oh, no. No.

1376
01:18:58,739 --> 01:18:59,740
Look, this is...

1377
01:19:00,741 --> 01:19:01,909
This is good.

1378
01:19:03,202 --> 01:19:04,786
There's a lesson in there, you know?

1379
01:19:04,870 --> 01:19:07,539
If you're gonna run for office,
your past is fair game.

1380
01:19:07,623 --> 01:19:10,667
He posted that when he was in sixth grade,
you butt crack.

1381
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:12,169
- Look, I...
- He was 11.

1382
01:19:12,252 --> 01:19:13,921
I don't want
anything to happen to the kid, okay?

1383
01:19:14,004 --> 01:19:14,838
I'm not a monster.

1384
01:19:14,922 --> 01:19:16,882
Look, what about all the people
that took the clickbait?

1385
01:19:17,382 --> 01:19:18,383
What about those people?

1386
01:19:18,467 --> 01:19:20,802
- Good. Yes. Good.
- All right. This is on them.

1387
01:19:20,886 --> 01:19:24,306
- What's good?
- This inner turmoil. Let that get in you.

1388
01:19:24,389 --> 01:19:27,184
- Come on. This where real change begins.
- No.

1389
01:19:29,436 --> 01:19:31,813
Can we re-cue CPM-163, please?

1390
01:19:31,897 --> 01:19:34,608
- What's CPM-163?
- No, I know it's very unusual.

1391
01:19:35,192 --> 01:19:39,696
Please, we need to go back
to Christmas Past's Memory 163.

1392
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:40,739
What is that?

1393
01:19:40,822 --> 01:19:43,534
Thank you, Bonnie. No,
I don't wanna hear about it right n...

1394
01:19:47,412 --> 01:19:48,372
Thank you, Patrick.

1395
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,000
Stay with me, Clint. Stay in it.

1396
01:19:52,626 --> 01:19:54,127
Oh, come on. Don't do this.

1397
01:19:55,212 --> 01:19:57,589
No, it's okay. I'm here with you.

1398
01:19:57,673 --> 01:19:59,424
Please don't do this. Come on, man. I...

1399
01:19:59,508 --> 01:20:01,468
You can do it. Come on.

1400
01:20:03,011 --> 01:20:04,513
I'm here with you the whole way.

1401
01:20:08,517 --> 01:20:10,644
Hey, guys. Hey, Wrenny.

1402
01:20:10,727 --> 01:20:11,895
Look what Uncle Clint got ya.

1403
01:20:11,979 --> 01:20:15,107
Cool.
Mom, can I donate it to the sick kids?

1404
01:20:15,190 --> 01:20:17,067
That would be really nice, sweetheart.

1405
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:19,903
- There's a bin down in the lobby, okay?
- Yeah, give it away.

1406
01:20:19,987 --> 01:20:20,821
Glad we wrapped it.

1407
01:20:20,904 --> 01:20:22,990
It's next to the teddy bear, okay?
Have Martha help you.

1408
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:26,535
Well, you're certainly looking brighter
than you were before.

1409
01:20:26,618 --> 01:20:27,911
Clint, don't.

1410
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:33,000
Before she comes back, listen.
It's time that I made some arrangements.

1411
01:20:34,001 --> 01:20:37,045
Okay. Stop it.

1412
01:20:37,129 --> 01:20:40,632
I need to ask you a favor,
and it's a doozy.

1413
01:20:42,593 --> 01:20:46,180
When I'm gone, I'd like you to take Wren.

1414
01:20:46,805 --> 01:20:47,931
Okay.

1415
01:20:49,433 --> 01:20:51,935
Okay, stop. You're not gonna go anywhere.

1416
01:20:52,728 --> 01:20:55,981
You know, even if you did,
which you're not.

1417
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:58,317
Okay, I'm not the dad type.

1418
01:20:58,901 --> 01:21:00,652
I'm really not. You know, I'm crazy busy

1419
01:21:00,736 --> 01:21:03,488
and I'm, you know… selfish.

1420
01:21:03,572 --> 01:21:07,576
Clint, you don't fool me.
I know who you are underneath all of that.

1421
01:21:07,659 --> 01:21:09,912
That's where you've always
been wrong about me.

1422
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:11,663
I really am this selfish.

1423
01:21:12,247 --> 01:21:13,957
Bad news, Carrie.

1424
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:18,086
They were out of vegan stuff downstairs
so I just got you a chicken noodle.

1425
01:21:18,170 --> 01:21:20,714
But I picked out all the chicken bits,
so it should be good.

1426
01:21:20,797 --> 01:21:22,007
- Hey, Owen.
- Hey.

1427
01:21:24,426 --> 01:21:26,762
Our sister has something
that she wants to ask you. It's a favor.

1428
01:21:26,845 --> 01:21:30,182
I think, if you could just hear it
with an open mind and make me proud, okay?

1429
01:21:30,265 --> 01:21:31,517
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

1430
01:21:38,357 --> 01:21:39,816
Hey, Carrie.

1431
01:21:43,487 --> 01:21:44,488
What do you need?

1432
01:21:45,531 --> 01:21:47,074
Anything in the whole wide world.

1433
01:21:47,950 --> 01:21:51,286
- We're family. I'll do anything for you.
- Thank you, Owen.

1434
01:21:53,163 --> 01:21:56,375
Hey. I know that wasn't easy.

1435
01:21:57,292 --> 01:22:01,004
But you faced it and that took guts
and I'm proud of you. Come here.

1436
01:22:02,548 --> 01:22:03,549
Yeah.

1437
01:22:03,632 --> 01:22:06,260
Ease up. That's enough.
You're gonna get ectoplasm all over me.

1438
01:22:06,343 --> 01:22:09,304
All right.
Your final ghost will be right with you.

1439
01:22:09,805 --> 01:22:14,101
Now, he's a little imposing.
Doesn't say much. Mostly points at stuff.

1440
01:22:14,184 --> 01:22:16,687
Wait. Hold... That's it? You're leaving?

1441
01:22:17,938 --> 01:22:20,858
Well, yeah. My part of the haunt is over.

1442
01:22:22,025 --> 01:22:25,237
But don't worry. You're gonna do great.

1443
01:22:26,113 --> 01:22:28,407
No. Hold on.

1444
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,617
You don't get to make me relive
the worst moment of my life

1445
01:22:30,701 --> 01:22:32,244
and then just F-O. What about you?

1446
01:22:32,744 --> 01:22:34,538
I faced my kicker. Now it's your turn.

1447
01:22:34,621 --> 01:22:37,583
Clint, how many times
do I have to tell you? It's not about me.

1448
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:39,459
Oh, well, then good afternoon.

1449
01:22:39,543 --> 01:22:42,045
Uh-uh. Oh, no.
You know I find that triggering.

1450
01:22:42,129 --> 01:22:43,463
- That's why I said it.
- Take that down a notch.

1451
01:22:43,547 --> 01:22:45,299
Who are you to tell anyone
how to live their life

1452
01:22:45,382 --> 01:22:48,719
when you're busy running away
from your own? Just admit it.

1453
01:22:48,802 --> 01:22:51,471
All right. No, that'll do.
Not another word.

1454
01:22:51,555 --> 01:22:54,641
- Let's get you back to the office before...
- No shame in admitting you're afraid.

1455
01:22:54,725 --> 01:22:57,436
Oh, yeah? What is it I'm so afraid of?

1456
01:22:57,519 --> 01:22:59,271
You're afraid of that one question.

1457
01:22:59,771 --> 01:23:00,939
What's he on about?

1458
01:23:01,857 --> 01:23:03,901
I don't... I have no idea.

1459
01:23:03,984 --> 01:23:04,985
Sure you do.

1460
01:23:06,820 --> 01:23:08,739
It's the question
that keeps you up at night.

1461
01:23:09,740 --> 01:23:13,493
Keeps you working here
year after year, after year,

1462
01:23:13,577 --> 01:23:15,245
when you could be alive again.

1463
01:23:18,207 --> 01:23:21,335
Oh, no. There is no call
for singing. Now come on. Let's...

1464
01:23:21,418 --> 01:23:24,963
Doesn't matter how many people you change,
no matter how much good you do.

1465
01:23:25,047 --> 01:23:26,965
You still don't know the answer.

1466
01:23:28,175 --> 01:23:29,343
The answer to what?

1467
01:23:37,267 --> 01:23:40,145
<i>Am I forever</i>

1468
01:23:42,022 --> 01:23:43,941
<i>Unredeemable?</i>

1469
01:23:44,650 --> 01:23:48,237
Why, that's preposterous.
You were redeemed. I was there.

1470
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:51,823
<i>But can I ever overcome</i>

1471
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:54,701
<i>All the wrongs I'm running from?</i>

1472
01:23:54,785 --> 01:23:57,120
That was all so long ago.

1473
01:23:57,204 --> 01:23:59,790
You've more than made up
for all that by now.

1474
01:23:59,873 --> 01:24:02,543
<i>Can my worst be left behind</i>

1475
01:24:02,626 --> 01:24:05,254
<i>And do I deserve to find</i>

1476
01:24:05,337 --> 01:24:09,967
<i>There's a soul
Who could see any good in me</i>

1477
01:24:12,803 --> 01:24:16,265
<i>Or will I only ever be</i>

1478
01:24:18,183 --> 01:24:20,185
<i>Unredeemable?</i>

1479
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:24,690
There's only one way to find out, boys.

1480
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:27,276
He takes his retirement right now.

1481
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:29,236
All right. That's enough. Back to bed.

1482
01:24:29,319 --> 01:24:30,529
Oh, no.

1483
01:24:47,171 --> 01:24:51,675
<i>Spent every waking minute
Taking all that I could take</i>

1484
01:24:52,885 --> 01:24:56,930
<i>Never stopped to reckon
With the ruin in my wake</i>

1485
01:24:58,348 --> 01:25:03,228
<i>With all the bridges that I burned
The wounds I didn't mend</i>

1486
01:25:03,312 --> 01:25:07,983
<i>All the worth I thought I earned
It turned worthless in the end</i>

1487
01:25:09,234 --> 01:25:10,235
What's going on?

1488
01:25:10,986 --> 01:25:12,446
<i>What was it for?</i>

1489
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:17,576
<i>Well, is it possible</i>

1490
01:25:17,659 --> 01:25:23,165
<i>I'm meant for something more?</i>

1491
01:25:23,248 --> 01:25:27,794
<i>Am I forever unredeemable?</i>

1492
01:25:29,213 --> 01:25:35,010
<i>Can I be a man who breaks
From a lifetime of mistakes?</i>

1493
01:25:35,594 --> 01:25:40,474
<i>Can my worst be left behind
And do I deserve to find</i>

1494
01:25:40,557 --> 01:25:43,477
<i>A kind of love that I can lean on</i>

1495
01:25:43,560 --> 01:25:46,897
<i>Every day</i>

1496
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:50,567
<i>Or will I learn I have to stay</i>

1497
01:25:51,151 --> 01:25:53,904
<i>Unredeemable?</i>

1498
01:25:53,987 --> 01:25:55,781
Listen well, Ebenezer.

1499
01:25:55,864 --> 01:26:00,327
<i>Unredeemable</i>

1500
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:04,331
You will be visited by three spirits.

1501
01:26:05,165 --> 01:26:07,292
You're wasting your time, Jacob.

1502
01:26:17,177 --> 01:26:18,220
Are you sure?

1503
01:26:26,812 --> 01:26:28,355
Come on, big guy.

1504
01:26:29,940 --> 01:26:34,236
<i>We have to believe
Inside the worst of us</i>

1505
01:26:34,319 --> 01:26:39,199
<i>-There is some decency there
-Decency there</i>

1506
01:26:39,283 --> 01:26:44,371
<i>You know that you can achieve
Something miraculous</i>

1507
01:26:44,872 --> 01:26:46,915
<i>If you'd only dare</i>

1508
01:26:46,999 --> 01:26:49,334
<i>-If you dare
-If you dare</i>

1509
01:26:49,418 --> 01:26:54,590
<i>I have to go, I have to try</i>

1510
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:56,008
<i>That's how I'll know</i>

1511
01:26:56,091 --> 01:26:59,344
<i>Know if I'm</i>

1512
01:26:59,428 --> 01:27:04,183
<i>-Forever unredeemable
-Unredeemable</i>

1513
01:27:04,266 --> 01:27:09,521
<i>If I'll ever be someone
Who makes up for all they've done</i>

1514
01:27:09,605 --> 01:27:13,901
<i>- Or is all I am unlovable?
- Unlovable</i>

1515
01:27:13,984 --> 01:27:16,695
<i>Am I someone someone can forgive?</i>

1516
01:27:16,778 --> 01:27:20,866
<i>Can I take the leap and live?</i>

1517
01:27:20,949 --> 01:27:23,535
<i>There's a lot I leave behind</i>

1518
01:27:23,619 --> 01:27:27,122
<i>But I gotta go and find if it's true</i>

1519
01:27:27,206 --> 01:27:30,959
<i>-That there is truly good in me
-Truly good</i>

1520
01:27:31,043 --> 01:27:36,465
<i>And maybe see that I won't always be</i>

1521
01:27:36,548 --> 01:27:41,094
<i>-Unredeemable
-Unredeemable</i>

1522
01:27:41,178 --> 01:27:42,638
<i>Am I unredeemable?</i>

1523
01:27:42,721 --> 01:27:46,475
<i>Can you redeem the unredeemable?</i>

1524
01:27:46,558 --> 01:27:52,981
<i>Unredeemable</i>

1525
01:28:03,867 --> 01:28:04,868
What is this?

1526
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:07,079
- What's what?
- Wait, am I…

1527
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:09,540
I think so.

1528
01:28:09,623 --> 01:28:11,124
You're warm.

1529
01:28:12,709 --> 01:28:14,545
Yes! I'm warm.

1530
01:28:15,504 --> 01:28:16,505
What's wrong?

1531
01:28:16,588 --> 01:28:17,673
- Itch.
- What?

1532
01:28:17,756 --> 01:28:19,299
- Itch. I got... Do you mind?
- Okay.

1533
01:28:20,551 --> 01:28:23,262
- Okay. All right.
- Yeah. To the right?

1534
01:28:23,345 --> 01:28:24,805
Pajamas are made of burlap.

1535
01:28:24,888 --> 01:28:26,348
Can you get into my sleeping gown?

1536
01:28:26,431 --> 01:28:28,559
- Just...
- No. God, I would rather not.

1537
01:28:28,642 --> 01:28:29,893
Please, I beg of you.

1538
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:33,730
- Oh, yes! Oh, that's terrific.
- Okay. There we go. That's it.

1539
01:28:33,814 --> 01:28:37,025
- Oh, mommy.
- Okay.

1540
01:28:37,109 --> 01:28:38,360
- That feels so good.
- Yep.

1541
01:28:38,443 --> 01:28:40,195
I forgot what it's like
to scratch an itch.

1542
01:28:40,279 --> 01:28:42,948
I forgot what it was like to feel this way
about my hand.

1543
01:28:43,615 --> 01:28:44,616
Thank you.

1544
01:28:48,704 --> 01:28:50,998
Wow. Why am I so heavy?

1545
01:28:51,081 --> 01:28:54,084
- Gravity.
- Yeah.

1546
01:28:55,252 --> 01:28:56,795
Oh, my…

1547
01:28:57,921 --> 01:29:00,090
- You have…
- Indoor plumbing.

1548
01:29:01,091 --> 01:29:02,885
- Could I?
- You may.

1549
01:29:10,058 --> 01:29:11,143
Careful.

1550
01:29:12,686 --> 01:29:14,563
This is amazing!

1551
01:29:15,272 --> 01:29:19,943
I have always wondered what this
would be like and it does not disappoint.

1552
01:29:21,528 --> 01:29:23,947
Hey! What's conditioner?

1553
01:29:24,448 --> 01:29:26,783
Well, you wanna use that on your head.

1554
01:29:27,743 --> 01:29:28,785
Too late!

1555
01:29:29,286 --> 01:29:32,122
- Can I do this every month?
- Sure.

1556
01:29:32,206 --> 01:29:35,709
Look out, New York City.
This guy showers once a month!

1557
01:29:40,172 --> 01:29:42,883
Your clothes are really too tight on me.
I feel silly.

1558
01:29:42,966 --> 01:29:44,468
No, you look fine. Come on.

1559
01:29:44,551 --> 01:29:46,053
Hey, look at this guy!

1560
01:29:47,221 --> 01:29:50,891
Jacket. Slacks. Little pocket square.

1561
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:53,310
No, don't. Put that back, please.
Thank you. He can...

1562
01:29:54,102 --> 01:29:56,104
- He can see me. You can see me.
- Yes, he can.

1563
01:29:56,188 --> 01:29:58,357
- Yeah, I can see you.
- He can see you very well, I think.

1564
01:29:58,440 --> 01:30:01,068
You're gonna wanna get used to that.
Really you are.

1565
01:30:01,151 --> 01:30:02,486
- Everyone can see me.
- Yes.

1566
01:30:02,569 --> 01:30:04,196
Hello! You can see me!

1567
01:30:04,821 --> 01:30:07,115
- You're gonna wanna get used to that too.
- Man.

1568
01:30:07,616 --> 01:30:08,992
Are you okay?

1569
01:30:09,076 --> 01:30:11,245
- Think so. He's fine.
- I think so. Yeah.

1570
01:30:11,828 --> 01:30:14,915
- You look stupid.
- You look stupid.

1571
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:16,792
No. Hey, Dave, back off.

1572
01:30:16,875 --> 01:30:19,419
- Okay. Will you just get it together?
- Well, no, he looked stupid.

1573
01:30:19,503 --> 01:30:21,380
- There she is. Let's go talk to her and...
- Oh, no. That's her.

1574
01:30:21,463 --> 01:30:22,631
You know what? Here's the thing.

1575
01:30:24,049 --> 01:30:26,301
Let's just put a pin in it, okay?

1576
01:30:27,553 --> 01:30:29,096
I don't know what to say to her.

1577
01:30:29,179 --> 01:30:30,931
What do you mean?
You were doing great before.

1578
01:30:31,014 --> 01:30:32,224
Just do more of that.

1579
01:30:32,724 --> 01:30:35,727
Yeah, but that's when she was
a fantasy. And now she's real.

1580
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:37,354
I'm gonna screw it up.

1581
01:30:37,938 --> 01:30:39,982
Look, I think I made a big mistake, okay?

1582
01:30:40,065 --> 01:30:41,817
I'm not ready for any of this.

1583
01:30:41,900 --> 01:30:43,777
I used way too much water in the shower.

1584
01:30:44,278 --> 01:30:47,406
I mean, is that who I am here?
The guy who hogs all the hot water?

1585
01:30:47,489 --> 01:30:49,074
- Hey, check it out.
- What?

1586
01:30:53,203 --> 01:30:54,204
That was fantastic.

1587
01:30:54,288 --> 01:30:58,500
Yeah. Get it together.
Enough with the buyer's remorse.

1588
01:30:58,584 --> 01:31:00,294
Hey, you made the right decision.

1589
01:31:00,377 --> 01:31:03,005
Don't think. Deep breath.

1590
01:31:03,755 --> 01:31:06,466
Go get her. Now.
Before she gets away. Trust me.

1591
01:31:08,510 --> 01:31:10,012
- Okay.
- Okay.

1592
01:31:12,014 --> 01:31:14,516
- I will slap your head off.
- No. I'll go talk to her.

1593
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,934
I will. I promise.

1594
01:31:16,602 --> 01:31:20,189
The next ghost…
The future's always in flux.

1595
01:31:20,272 --> 01:31:25,110
I don't know what you're gonna see,
but just hear the guy out. All right?

1596
01:31:25,194 --> 01:31:27,946
- I mean, you asked me why I chose you.
- I know why you did.

1597
01:31:28,030 --> 01:31:31,617
Because I can be a positive force
for mankind, or whatever.

1598
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:34,203
No. Well, yes. At first.

1599
01:31:35,204 --> 01:31:38,123
But then when I found out
you were unredeemable, like me,

1600
01:31:39,499 --> 01:31:45,464
I thought, "If I can change this guy,
maybe there's hope for me too."

1601
01:31:55,265 --> 01:31:56,517
Yeah.

1602
01:31:57,184 --> 01:31:58,185
Kimberly?

1603
01:31:58,894 --> 01:32:05,025
Hey. You're back.
And in a boldly tight suit.

1604
01:32:05,108 --> 01:32:07,361
Yeah. It is a little snug.

1605
01:32:07,444 --> 01:32:12,699
No, I like it. It's kind of
a Euro-fit. And I like it on you.

1606
01:32:12,783 --> 01:32:17,120
Yeah, it is a Euro-fit,
because I buy all my clothes in Germany.

1607
01:32:17,204 --> 01:32:19,164
- Yeah.
- I can see.

1608
01:32:21,208 --> 01:32:23,794
Sorry, but would you...

1609
01:32:24,628 --> 01:32:28,006
Would you wanna go somewhere
and maybe, I don't…

1610
01:32:28,090 --> 01:32:30,676
- No, you don't even have to answer...
- No, I would love to... Yeah.

1611
01:32:30,759 --> 01:32:33,136
- I would love to.
- Great. Really?

1612
01:32:33,220 --> 01:32:36,974
- Totally. I love "somewhere."
- Yeah, me too. Oh, my gosh.

1613
01:32:37,057 --> 01:32:38,308
What?

1614
01:32:39,434 --> 01:32:41,436
What is it? An itch?

1615
01:32:42,062 --> 01:32:43,063
Here, let me help you.

1616
01:32:43,981 --> 01:32:44,982
- Where? Right there?
- Yeah.

1617
01:32:45,065 --> 01:32:46,149
That's a choice.

1618
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:49,111
That is heaven on a stick.

1619
01:32:50,153 --> 01:32:51,154
Thank you.

1620
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:52,823
There's a place
called "Heaven on a Stick."

1621
01:32:52,906 --> 01:32:55,284
- It serves corn dogs, but, I mean, it…
- Okay.

1622
01:32:55,367 --> 01:32:57,536
- It's food, right?
- It's delicious.

1623
01:33:13,844 --> 01:33:15,512
- Hey, Sydney.
- Hey, Clint.

1624
01:33:15,596 --> 01:33:17,181
Hey, how you doin'?

1625
01:33:20,309 --> 01:33:22,728
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1626
01:33:23,478 --> 01:33:24,479
Hey, Stuart.

1627
01:33:25,272 --> 01:33:26,523
Come on!

1628
01:33:38,827 --> 01:33:40,412
This is beautiful.

1629
01:33:41,038 --> 01:33:44,875
So, you just decided one day

1630
01:33:44,958 --> 01:33:46,752
{\an8}that you're gonna quit your job,

1631
01:33:47,252 --> 01:33:48,921
{\an8}leave it all behind, and move here?

1632
01:33:49,505 --> 01:33:53,800
{\an8}Well, every year I'd say,
"It's time to move on."

1633
01:33:54,843 --> 01:33:56,637
And then every year, I chose to stay.

1634
01:33:57,221 --> 01:33:59,556
And our choices make us who we are,
don't they?

1635
01:34:00,474 --> 01:34:03,268
Yeah. Guess they do.

1636
01:34:03,352 --> 01:34:06,355
So this year, I chose something else.

1637
01:34:06,438 --> 01:34:09,441
Honestly,
I'm worried I made a huge mistake.

1638
01:34:09,525 --> 01:34:14,321
But, I mean, if I hadn't,
I wouldn't be here with you.

1639
01:34:20,077 --> 01:34:21,078
Is that okay?

1640
01:34:26,917 --> 01:34:30,212
<i>The city is sparkling
With twinkling lights</i>

1641
01:34:30,712 --> 01:34:34,174
<i>It's one of those magic
"Manhattan-y" nights</i>

1642
01:34:34,258 --> 01:34:37,803
<i>Can't tell what comes next
He's sure taking it slow</i>

1643
01:34:37,886 --> 01:34:42,391
<i>But he's holding my hand
And he's not letting go</i>

1644
01:34:42,975 --> 01:34:46,103
<i>He's goofy, he's tall
He's got a good heart</i>

1645
01:34:46,186 --> 01:34:50,315
<i>But I don't wanna fall
And have it all fall apart</i>

1646
01:34:50,399 --> 01:34:51,817
<i>I look in his eyes</i>

1647
01:34:51,900 --> 01:34:56,613
<i>And they keep saying
"Leap and the net will appear"</i>

1648
01:34:57,239 --> 01:34:59,491
<i>So why not dive in</i>

1649
01:34:59,575 --> 01:35:03,912
<i>'Cause a brand new beginning
Feels long overdue</i>

1650
01:35:03,996 --> 01:35:07,207
<i>That's the view from here</i>

1651

<i>That's the view from here</i>

1652
01:35:15,048 --> 01:35:17,050
They said it's supposed to snow tonight.

1653
01:35:17,134 --> 01:35:19,344
Really? Doesn't feel cold enough.

1654
01:35:20,012 --> 01:35:21,305
Not cold at all.

1655
01:35:23,223 --> 01:35:24,975
<i>How wet are my armpits?</i>

1656
01:35:25,058 --> 01:35:26,768
<i>How red is my face?</i>

1657
01:35:27,269 --> 01:35:30,522
<i>When I used to date
Holding hands was third base</i>

1658
01:35:30,606 --> 01:35:32,524
<i>I think there's a spark</i>

1659
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:34,443
<i>Could this thing become real?</i>

1660
01:35:34,526 --> 01:35:39,656
<i>Could it possibly be
That she might feel like I feel?</i>

1661
01:35:41,074 --> 01:35:44,828
<i>This woman's as kind
As a human could be</i>

1662
01:35:44,912 --> 01:35:48,373
<i>So why would she wind up
With someone like me?</i>

1663
01:35:48,457 --> 01:35:51,251
<i>And what if we find out, in time</i>

1664
01:35:51,335 --> 01:35:54,546
<i>Maybe I'm that same jerk like I fear?</i>

1665
01:35:56,089 --> 01:35:59,635
<i>'Cause the man that I see

01:36:32,084 --> 01:36:35,838
<i>Maybe I haven't lost sight
Of what's right</i>

1670
01:36:35,921 --> 01:36:40,342
<i>'Cause tonight it's so perfectly clear</i>

1671
01:36:41,343 --> 01:36:45,764
<i>Somehow I see who I could be</i>

1672
01:36:45,848 --> 01:36:49,643
<i>Just being with you</i>

1673
01:36:51,270 --> 01:36:57,192
<i>That's the view from here</i>

1674
01:37:00,028 --> 01:37:05,701
<i>That's the view from here</i>

1675
01:37:07,661 --> 01:37:09,997
I don't really buy all my clothes
in Germany.

1676
01:37:41,069 --> 01:37:42,070
All in favor?

1677
01:37:42,738 --> 01:37:43,822
The motion is carried.

1678
01:37:43,906 --> 01:37:46,283
- Well, this is great.
- Community volunteer work will be…

1679
01:37:46,366 --> 01:37:48,994
She did it.
She looks presidential up here.

1680
01:37:49,077 --> 01:37:50,454
Look at her go with her little gavel.

1681
01:37:51,038 --> 01:37:55,501
Next order of business is that all student
fund raising will be overseen by an in…

1682
01:37:57,377 --> 01:37:59,713
…will be overseen by an independent…

1683
01:37:59,796 --> 01:38:00,881
Did you see this?

1684
01:38:02,841 --> 01:38:03,926
What's going on?

1685
01:38:08,138 --> 01:38:09,765
What is it? What does it say?

1686
01:38:23,737 --> 01:38:25,155
What's this supposed to be?

1687
01:38:29,701 --> 01:38:32,913
Wait. What are you telling me? The kid?

1688
01:38:35,958 --> 01:38:38,210
Because of a little online dust up?

1689
01:38:39,878 --> 01:38:42,631
How was I supposed to know
that he would do something like this?

1690
01:39:00,232 --> 01:39:01,441
Wait a minute. Hold on.

1691
01:39:01,525 --> 01:39:03,485
It's just shadows of things to come.

1692
01:39:03,569 --> 01:39:05,529
I mean,
these haven't actually happened yet.

1693
01:39:05,612 --> 01:39:07,489
I'm not gonna turn my life upside down
for you people,

1694
01:39:07,573 --> 01:39:10,158
but this is an easy one.
I can fix this one.

1695
01:39:12,744 --> 01:39:15,330
Let's just cut the tour short, all right?

1696
01:39:16,498 --> 01:39:18,584
You don't speak? You just point at things?

1697
01:39:19,293 --> 01:39:21,795
Why don't you point to the way out, huh?
Is that it? Right there?

1698
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:29,761
Old me.

1699
01:39:31,054 --> 01:39:32,723
I don't wanna know!

1700
01:39:33,932 --> 01:39:35,225
Come on.

1701
01:39:42,691 --> 01:39:43,692
{\an8}Yes!

1702
01:39:44,568 --> 01:39:47,654
{\an8}Yes, I've seen the movies.
I know the drill.

1703
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:49,531
{\an8}Here. Here it is.

1704
01:39:50,407 --> 01:39:51,408
{\an8}Right here. The...

1705
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:54,203
{\an8}- 93. Not bad.
- I got him.

1706
01:39:54,286 --> 01:39:58,123
Yeah, he jumped ahead to YTC-407.
Pretty sure he was looking for me. Sorry.

1707
01:39:58,207 --> 01:39:59,958
- Hey, it's you.
- Yeah.

1708
01:40:00,042 --> 01:40:02,127
Listen, can you please help me
get the hell out of here?

1709
01:40:02,211 --> 01:40:04,463
Don't get all clingy, okay?
I'm at work right now.

1710
01:40:04,546 --> 01:40:06,298
I knew you'd get too attached.
I knew this...

1711
01:40:07,090 --> 01:40:08,383
Here he is. Hey, over here.

1712
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:19,186
You good?

1713
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,440
Yes, dude, I see it.

1714
01:40:23,524 --> 01:40:26,109
It's so disturbing.
I'm so sad. Are we done? Can I go?

1715
01:40:29,363 --> 01:40:31,073
- You all right?
- Are you trying to talk?

1716
01:40:32,699 --> 01:40:34,535
It's so sad.
Look what you've driven him to.

1717
01:40:38,747 --> 01:40:39,790
You ruined everything!

1718
01:40:39,873 --> 01:40:41,333
Oh, my God, you did it.

1719
01:40:41,416 --> 01:40:42,334
That's what he sounds like?

1720
01:40:44,378 --> 01:40:46,880
- You made my best friend quit!
- Yeah!

1721
01:40:46,964 --> 01:40:51,593
No! I did not. That was his choice.
And frankly, I'm proud of him.

1722
01:40:51,677 --> 01:40:53,512
That's why I'ma kick your ass.

1723
01:40:57,015 --> 01:40:59,017
You been Christmas Caroled, bitch!

1724
01:41:02,604 --> 01:41:05,148
I'm back. What time is it?

1725
01:41:05,816 --> 01:41:06,817
4:15.

1726
01:41:06,900 --> 01:41:08,610
4:15. Good. Thank God.

1727
01:41:08,694 --> 01:41:11,405
There's still time. I gotta find my phone.
Where's my phone?

1728
01:41:11,488 --> 01:41:14,283
Hey, I think I have
moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

1729
01:41:14,783 --> 01:41:17,286
No, you don't. Stop watching that.

1730
01:41:17,870 --> 01:41:19,496
God, you look like hell.

1731
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:21,707
I know. It's just, I...

1732
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,750
Wait, did you see your future?

1733
01:41:23,834 --> 01:41:25,377
- Did it change you?
- No!

1734
01:41:25,460 --> 01:41:28,463
No. There's just one little wrinkle
I need to iron out.

1735
01:41:28,547 --> 01:41:31,133
- Where the hell is my phone?
- You mean this phone?

1736
01:41:31,216 --> 01:41:34,052
No, I don't know her number.
Like I know anyone's number.

1737
01:41:34,136 --> 01:41:36,680
- It's 12 blocks. We're gonna walk.
- Wait. What's going on?

1738
01:41:36,763 --> 01:41:39,141
- What... What'd you see?
- Nothing. It's fine.

1739
01:41:39,224 --> 01:41:41,518
I just think it's better if Wren
doesn't post the video, that's all.

1740
01:41:41,602 --> 01:41:42,728
What happens if she posts it?

1741
01:41:42,811 --> 01:41:43,937
- Something bad?
- Oh, come on!

1742
01:41:44,438 --> 01:41:46,273
What... What'd ya… see?

1743
01:41:46,356 --> 01:41:49,067
Oh, God. That's still kinda thrilling.

1744
01:41:53,614 --> 01:41:55,282
Clint, wait up.

1745
01:41:55,365 --> 01:41:56,575
You don't have to come.

1746
01:41:57,075 --> 01:41:58,785
You seem very passionate about this.

1747
01:41:58,869 --> 01:42:00,370
Are you sure you haven't changed?

1748
01:42:00,454 --> 01:42:03,290
No, I didn't.
Will you quit asking me that?

1749
01:42:03,373 --> 01:42:04,791
Clint, please slow down!

1750
01:42:06,752 --> 01:42:10,464
Oh, boy! Did your head make that clang?

1751
01:42:10,547 --> 01:42:12,174
That was so loud.

1752
01:42:12,925 --> 01:42:14,301
That's gotta be a concussion.

1753
01:42:14,384 --> 01:42:17,554
- No.
- Okay. Here we go. All right, easy.

1754
01:42:18,347 --> 01:42:19,973
Are we going back up?
Did you forget something?

1755
01:42:20,474 --> 01:42:21,475
No? Okay.

1756
01:42:21,558 --> 01:42:22,893
- I don't know.
- All right.

1757
01:42:24,728 --> 01:42:27,064
Sir, could we please
speed it up a little? Thank you.

1758
01:42:27,147 --> 01:42:30,567
Hey, what's going on?
Did you see something in your future?

1759
01:42:30,651 --> 01:42:33,278
It's no big deal. I...
Hey, how did it go with Kimberly?

1760
01:42:34,321 --> 01:42:35,364
Terrible.

1761
01:42:36,031 --> 01:42:40,035
We walked all over Manhattan
and talked and connected and…

1762
01:42:41,578 --> 01:42:44,331
We even kissed. On the lips.

1763
01:42:45,415 --> 01:42:47,876
How is this ter... That sounds amazing.

1764
01:42:47,960 --> 01:42:51,421
It was. She is.
She just doesn't know who I am.

1765
01:42:51,505 --> 01:42:54,800
Oh, my God.
Will you quit with the unredeemable crap?

1766
01:42:54,883 --> 01:42:56,677
You just haven't dated
in a few hundred years.

1767
01:42:56,760 --> 01:42:58,762
Driver!
This is a matter of life and death here.

1768
01:42:58,846 --> 01:43:01,181
- Can we kick it in the ass?
- You got it.

1769
01:43:03,183 --> 01:43:05,561
"Life and death"?
I thought you said it was no big deal.

1770
01:43:13,569 --> 01:43:15,404
Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen.

1771
01:43:15,487 --> 01:43:17,155
- You wanna go, wise ass?
- No, I...

1772
01:43:17,239 --> 01:43:22,077
Hey! It doesn't mean that anymore! Hey!

1773
01:43:22,160 --> 01:43:23,370
- Sorry!
- Hey!

1774
01:43:23,453 --> 01:43:25,330
- Sorry!
- Jesus!

1775
01:43:27,124 --> 01:43:29,960
You know, when they were doing my future,
there was this little sick kid.

1776
01:43:30,460 --> 01:43:32,212
- What did they call him?
- It was Tiny Tim.

1777
01:43:32,296 --> 01:43:34,965
- No. Sweet kid. One crutch.
- No.

1778
01:43:35,048 --> 01:43:37,092
- Little Larry.
- No. Tiny Tim.

1779
01:43:37,176 --> 01:43:39,678
- Pretty sure it was Little Larry. Anyway…
- Pretty sure it was Tiny Tim.

1780
01:43:39,761 --> 01:43:42,890
…In my future, Little Larry was dead,
and it was my fault.

1781
01:43:42,973 --> 01:43:45,559
Cratchit needed money for an operation,
and I was just too stingy.

1782
01:43:45,642 --> 01:43:46,810
It was Tiny Tim!

1783
01:43:47,436 --> 01:43:50,397
You killed Tiny Tim, okay?

1784
01:43:50,939 --> 01:43:52,733
Micro Michael? Super-small Steve.

1785
01:43:52,816 --> 01:43:55,068
Holy sh...

1786
01:43:55,152 --> 01:43:57,696
I like tiny. Teensy Tim?

1787
01:43:57,779 --> 01:43:59,865
Wait. Itsy Witsy Isaac.

1788
01:44:08,290 --> 01:44:10,083
Here you go. Merry Christmas.

1789
01:44:10,167 --> 01:44:11,335
Where is she? Come on.

1790
01:44:12,461 --> 01:44:14,713
Sh... Wrenny?

1791
01:44:15,422 --> 01:44:16,590
There.

1792
01:44:17,299 --> 01:44:19,218
Uncle Owen! Are you okay?

1793
01:44:19,927 --> 01:44:21,470
How do you never get better at this?

1794
01:44:21,553 --> 01:44:22,846
She posts it right after he fell.

1795
01:44:23,514 --> 01:44:25,807
{\an8}You should post it.
Might be a vote-getter.

1796
01:44:36,068 --> 01:44:37,569
- Clint.
- I need to talk to Wren.

1797
01:44:37,653 --> 01:44:39,696
Wait. Before you talk to her, just...

1798
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:40,906
This is important.

1799
01:44:41,490 --> 01:44:42,407
Right in the concussion.

1800
01:44:43,033 --> 01:44:44,409
Clint, come on. She's posting.

1801
01:44:46,370 --> 01:44:47,496
Come on.

1802
01:44:48,872 --> 01:44:50,040
No.

1803
01:44:52,042 --> 01:44:54,503
Oh, Kimberly, you have no idea
what you've just done.

1804
01:44:54,586 --> 01:44:59,174
I did what I should've done the minute
you asked me to dig up dirt on a child.

1805
01:45:00,342 --> 01:45:03,804
I told Wren that her choices
make her who she is.

1806
01:45:05,222 --> 01:45:08,267
And you know what? So do mine.

1807
01:45:09,726 --> 01:45:13,480
<i>'Cause the decent and honest
Young woman</i>

1808
01:45:13,564 --> 01:45:18,026
<i>Well, she's still part of me</i>

1809
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:21,321
<i>It's taken me years but I finally quit</i>

1810
01:45:21,905 --> 01:45:25,158
<i>There's a line you can't cross
And guess what? This is it</i>

1811
01:45:25,242 --> 01:45:28,745
<i>No, Clint
I haven't lost sight of what's right</i>

1812
01:45:28,829 --> 01:45:32,082
<i>'Cause it's perfectly clear</i>

1813
01:45:32,165 --> 01:45:34,376
Kimberly! I'm sorry to interrupt,

1814
01:45:34,459 --> 01:45:36,170
because you are killing it right now.

1815
01:45:36,253 --> 01:45:38,088
But did Wren post the video or not?

1816
01:45:38,172 --> 01:45:40,632
No, I didn't. I'm sorry. Are you mad?

1817
01:45:40,716 --> 01:45:42,467
- I mean, Kimberly...
- Hold on, you didn't post it?

1818
01:45:42,551 --> 01:45:44,636
- No.
- She didn't post it!

1819
01:45:45,220 --> 01:45:47,472
Because you're good like your mom.

1820
01:45:47,556 --> 01:45:48,557
You...

1821
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:51,018
- Yeah.
- I don't do hugging very well.

1822
01:45:51,101 --> 01:45:52,644
Oh, screw it. Come here, Kimberly.

1823
01:45:53,312 --> 01:45:55,731
Thank you. You have no idea
the good that you've done.

1824
01:45:55,814 --> 01:45:57,941
- Great, are we doing hugs? Come here.
- Owen. Okay, listen...

1825
01:45:58,025 --> 01:45:59,943
Hold on, just let me get this out first,
okay?

1826
01:46:00,027 --> 01:46:03,447
Look, I know I don't say this enough,
and you don't have to say it back…

1827
01:46:03,530 --> 01:46:04,740
I love you, too.

1828
01:46:05,824 --> 01:46:07,868
That's it. That's what I was gonna say.

1829
01:46:08,911 --> 01:46:10,579
- Bring it in. Okay.
- Yeah.

1830
01:46:11,872 --> 01:46:15,667
Okay. You win the hug.
Good stuff. That was fun.

1831
01:46:15,751 --> 01:46:17,377
Oh, boy, that's a relief.

1832
01:46:17,461 --> 01:46:19,171
Okay. Get ready.

1833
01:46:19,254 --> 01:46:20,255
Get ready.

1834
01:46:20,339 --> 01:46:22,466
'Cause something very special's
about to happen.

1835
01:46:22,549 --> 01:46:25,093
Just hang on.
No. You guys won't be able to see it.

1836
01:46:25,177 --> 01:46:26,678
Only he can see it.
I wish you could see it!

1837
01:46:26,762 --> 01:46:28,555
- Only he can see it. Yeah.
- That would be amazing.

1838
01:46:28,639 --> 01:46:30,557
You know what,
just excuse us for just one second.

1839
01:46:30,641 --> 01:46:34,061
- Love it. Love it, right?
- Okay. Hey. What is going on?

1840
01:46:34,144 --> 01:46:36,605
I don't know why this isn't happen...

1841
01:46:36,688 --> 01:46:37,814
I mean, you've changed.

1842
01:46:37,898 --> 01:46:40,484
There's supposed to be singing.
It's the big climax.

1843
01:46:40,567 --> 01:46:43,028
- Marley!
- I told you, I didn't change.

1844
01:46:43,111 --> 01:46:44,154
Marley?

1845
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:46,573
I just took back one dick move.

1846
01:46:46,657 --> 01:46:48,825
No.

1847
01:46:48,909 --> 01:46:51,578
You were about to prove
that unredeemables really can change.

1848
01:46:51,662 --> 01:46:54,081
You rushed down here to help a kid.

1849
01:46:54,164 --> 01:46:56,250
You told your brother that you loved him.

1850
01:46:56,333 --> 01:46:58,752
- I love you so hard, man.
- Thank...

1851
01:46:58,836 --> 01:47:00,712
If you say it too much, it loses its…

1852
01:47:01,213 --> 01:47:03,549
Why isn't this happening? Come on.

1853
01:47:03,632 --> 01:47:05,676
Probably 'cause I'm gonna go back
to work next week

1854
01:47:05,759 --> 01:47:07,427
and I'm gonna keep doing what I do.

1855
01:47:11,723 --> 01:47:14,476
I'll feel guilty for a couple of days,
but then I'll rationalize it.

1856
01:47:15,060 --> 01:47:18,313
I'm really good at that.
I have a talent for it.

1857
01:47:21,108 --> 01:47:24,319
I'm sorry, but it's not like
I wasn't aboveboard about all this.

1858
01:47:33,245 --> 01:47:36,707
- Roberto!
- He's having a weird day, all right?

1859
01:47:36,790 --> 01:47:37,791
I'm gonna go get him.

1860
01:47:37,875 --> 01:47:40,544
We'll rent some skates and stuff
and we'll have a good time.

1861
01:47:40,627 --> 01:47:43,881
- Right back.
- You do know I quit, right?

1862
01:47:47,092 --> 01:47:49,428
Hey! Where ya going?

1863
01:47:50,637 --> 01:47:51,722
I gotta go back.

1864
01:47:52,222 --> 01:47:53,974
Back? Can you even go back?

1865
01:47:54,683 --> 01:47:57,394
Clint, just let me go.
You don't wanna be around for this.

1866
01:47:57,477 --> 01:47:59,521
What do you mean by that?
Hey. Hold on a second.

1867
01:47:59,605 --> 01:48:01,315
What are you gonna do? Are you crazy?

1868
01:48:01,398 --> 01:48:03,609
It's still Christmas. There's still time.

1869
01:48:04,401 --> 01:48:06,862
I'll go back and
we'll figure something out,

1870
01:48:06,945 --> 01:48:08,906
and you'll change.

1871
01:48:09,531 --> 01:48:11,617
People don't change.

1872
01:48:11,700 --> 01:48:12,868
This isn't about me anymore.

1873
01:48:12,951 --> 01:48:15,704
This is about you running away
from your life again.

1874
01:48:15,787 --> 01:48:17,497
All right.
Look, you're here, you're human.

1875
01:48:17,581 --> 01:48:21,084
Hey. Besides,
I thought that we were really becoming…

1876
01:48:21,668 --> 01:48:24,213
- Becoming what?
- I thought we were becoming,

1877
01:48:24,296 --> 01:48:25,589
you know.

1878
01:48:26,465 --> 01:48:29,510
- Bros?
- Yeah.

1879
01:48:29,593 --> 01:48:31,929
I was gonna say friends, but bros.

1880
01:48:32,012 --> 01:48:35,140
Yeah. I just...
Look, if you're not feeling that, and th...

1881
01:48:35,224 --> 01:48:37,434
No. I am. I...

1882
01:48:37,518 --> 01:48:41,021
I mean,
I didn't wanna assume or make it weird.

1883
01:48:41,104 --> 01:48:42,356
It's not weird.

1884
01:48:42,981 --> 01:48:45,359
Yeah, I feel it. A lot.

1885
01:48:47,819 --> 01:48:49,238
I've never had a bro.

1886
01:48:49,863 --> 01:48:51,031
Well, you got one now.

1887
01:48:54,159 --> 01:48:55,911
And your bro is telling you to calm down

1888
01:48:56,912 --> 01:48:59,373
and come go ice-skating
with your new girlfriend.

1889
01:49:02,125 --> 01:49:03,252
She thinks I'm good.

1890
01:49:03,335 --> 01:49:04,628
Maybe you are.

1891
01:49:05,712 --> 01:49:08,340
- So now people do change?
- No, I don't know.

1892
01:49:09,216 --> 01:49:11,677
I don't know.
Maybe there's no magical quick fix.

1893
01:49:12,719 --> 01:49:15,264
Maybe you gotta put in the work,
you ever think about that?

1894
01:49:15,347 --> 01:49:18,433
You gotta wake up each day,
get out of bed and decide,

1895
01:49:18,517 --> 01:49:22,271
"How 'bout today
I don't wish anyone a good afternoon?"

1896
01:49:31,405 --> 01:49:32,447
Come on.

1897
01:49:42,207 --> 01:49:44,209
Hey! No!

1898
01:50:12,279 --> 01:50:13,488
What did you do?

1899
01:50:14,615 --> 01:50:15,657
I don't know.

1900
01:50:24,583 --> 01:50:27,252
Yes! See?
This is what I was talking about.

1901
01:50:28,670 --> 01:50:30,422
No. Wait. No. Wait, no.

1902
01:50:30,506 --> 01:50:33,217
Really, you got it all wrong. I was just...

1903
01:50:33,300 --> 01:50:35,761
No.

1904
01:50:35,844 --> 01:50:40,682
You just jumped in front of a bus
to save someone you care about.

1905
01:50:44,895 --> 01:50:45,896
My bro.

1906
01:50:45,979 --> 01:50:47,147
Your bro.

1907
01:50:47,231 --> 01:50:50,192
It was just a reflex. I did... Wait. Did I?

1908
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:52,444
Are you sure?

1909
01:50:52,945 --> 01:50:55,614
We've been doing this a long time,
Mr. Briggs.

1910
01:50:57,533 --> 01:50:58,867
We're quite sure.

1911
01:51:00,035 --> 01:51:02,621
Okay, then. Let's get some chili!

1912
01:51:03,413 --> 01:51:04,581
Yes!

1913
01:51:06,917 --> 01:51:09,211
We're doing another one?
Is that entirely nec...

1914
01:51:09,294 --> 01:51:12,714
No, it's fine. Go ahead. Okay, go ahead.

1915
01:51:13,465 --> 01:51:17,803
<i>I used to think that I was sure
Of what made people tick</i>

1916
01:51:18,637 --> 01:51:22,975
<i>You strip 'em down right to their core
And find a self-centered prick</i>

1917
01:51:23,475 --> 01:51:26,186
<i>I thought when the push
Came to the shove</i>

1918
01:51:26,270 --> 01:51:28,438
<i>I knew just what I'd do</i>

1919
01:51:28,522 --> 01:51:30,524
<i>I'd put me before you</i>

1920
01:51:31,108 --> 01:51:33,861
- But you didn't.
- Guess I didn't.

1921
01:51:33,944 --> 01:51:38,949
<i>You can be a cynic and a sinner
Who can only see the flaws</i>

1922
01:51:39,032 --> 01:51:43,579
<i>But even if you lost your way
You don't have to stay a lost cause</i>

1923
01:51:45,080 --> 01:51:46,957
<i>So can we do a little good?</i>

1924
01:51:47,958 --> 01:51:49,501
<i>Maybe give a little more?</i>

1925
01:51:50,878 --> 01:51:54,715
<i>Work a little harder than we did
The day before</i>

1926
01:51:55,465 --> 01:51:57,092
<i>It only takes a little good</i>

1927
01:51:58,177 --> 01:52:00,179
<i>And some doing what you can</i>

1928
01:52:01,263 --> 01:52:06,268
<i>Taking every chance to make the choice
To be a better man</i>

1929
01:52:06,351 --> 01:52:07,436
<i>So do a little good</i>

1930
01:52:11,940 --> 01:52:16,195
<i>Well, I have spent each Christmas Day
Obsessed with wrong and right</i>

1931
01:52:16,695 --> 01:52:19,364
<i>You thought change
Could only work one way</i>

1932
01:52:19,448 --> 01:52:21,408
<i>It had to happen in one night</i>

1933
01:52:21,992 --> 01:52:24,494
<i>But now you know, oh, now you know</i>

1934
01:52:24,578 --> 01:52:28,332
<i>The line of good and bad
Is not so clean</i>

1935
01:52:28,415 --> 01:52:32,211
<i>And what we are
Is something in between</i>

1936
01:52:32,294 --> 01:52:34,254
<i>It's an everyday decision</i>

1937
01:52:34,338 --> 01:52:37,132
<i>-Two steps forward
-One step back</i>

1938
01:52:37,216 --> 01:52:42,763
<i>But if you try to do what's right
You're on the right track</i>

1939
01:52:42,846 --> 01:52:47,309
<i>So try to do a little good
Maybe give a little more</i>

1940
01:52:48,310 --> 01:52:51,939
<i>Work a little harder than you did

-Hey</i>

1945
01:53:05,327 --> 01:53:08,997
<i>Just a little, just a little
Just a little</i>

1946
01:53:09,081 --> 01:53:11,750
<i>Maybe there's no magic wand</i>

1947
01:53:14,044 --> 01:53:16,004
<i>Maybe there's no switch to flip</i>

1948
01:53:19,007 --> 01:53:21,677
<i>Some days you may soar beyond</i>

1949
01:53:23,929 --> 01:53:27,933
<i>Some days you may soar beyond
And some days you start to slip</i>

1950
01:53:29,101 --> 01:53:33,230
<i>You can give the world some good

1972

-Hey</i>

1973
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:40,422

1974
01:54:42,633 --> 01:54:44,718
- Tiny Tim.
- Thank y...

1975
01:54:50,349 --> 01:54:51,517
Clint.

1976
01:54:53,143 --> 01:54:54,144
Clint!

1977
01:55:03,570 --> 01:55:04,780
Damn it, that hurt.

1978
01:55:05,447 --> 01:55:06,532
What the hell?

1979
01:55:07,407 --> 01:55:08,450
Is it over?

1980
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:11,954
Sure felt like a finale to me.

1981
01:55:14,164 --> 01:55:15,165
No.

1982
01:55:20,879 --> 01:55:21,880
Hey.

1983
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:23,841
You gotta be kidding me.

1984
01:55:24,675 --> 01:55:26,301
Why is everyone standing around?

1985
01:55:26,385 --> 01:55:29,096
Wanna do some CPR or something?
Why are they just standing there?

1986
01:55:29,763 --> 01:55:31,557
It's a little beyond CPR, I think.

1987
01:55:32,057 --> 01:55:34,768
I mean, I'm not even sure what's left
to blow into.

1988
01:55:35,435 --> 01:55:37,145
But we were just...
We were singing and dancing.

1989
01:55:38,313 --> 01:55:40,023
We just became bros.

1990
01:55:41,108 --> 01:55:42,693
No, I understand, I do.

1991
01:55:43,652 --> 01:55:49,157
But your sacrifice would have no meaning
if it had no consequence.

1992
01:55:49,241 --> 01:55:54,913
Okay, I get that. But this ending sucks.

1993
01:55:56,164 --> 01:55:57,624
It's not the end, Clint.

1994
01:56:16,268 --> 01:56:18,061
I'm so proud of you.

1995
01:56:30,115 --> 01:56:32,659
It's okay. Don't be scared.

1996
01:56:41,084 --> 01:56:43,462
Wait.

1997
01:56:43,545 --> 01:56:45,339
- Hold on.
- No. Go to the light.

1998
01:56:45,422 --> 01:56:47,549
- No. Just one second.
- Go to the light. Be with sis.

1999
01:56:47,633 --> 01:56:49,384
- Here's the thing. Little idea.
- Wrap it up.

2000
01:56:49,468 --> 01:56:51,637
It's a little out of left field.
Hear me out.

2001
01:56:54,348 --> 01:56:55,349
Thank you.

2002
01:56:57,100 --> 01:56:59,102
Have Margie in Research
set a meeting with Morality

2003
01:56:59,186 --> 01:57:00,938
to go over this business
with the prime minister.

2004
01:57:01,021 --> 01:57:02,981
And I want all new Heartstrings
by end of day.

2005
01:57:03,065 --> 01:57:04,650
- You got it, Captain.
- Let's get after it.

2006
01:57:05,943 --> 01:57:06,777
Hey, yo, Chief,

2007
01:57:06,860 --> 01:57:08,695
I'm gonna hit the food truck.
You want a street taco?

2008
01:57:08,779 --> 01:57:10,989
- Yes, please and thank you, buddy.
- No doubt.

2009
01:57:11,073 --> 01:57:12,449
Excuse me, Clint. What is all this?

2010
01:57:12,533 --> 01:57:14,952
- Which one is this year's perp?
- Well, they all are.

2011
01:57:15,035 --> 01:57:18,121
You're not reading my memos, are ya?
We're expanding, Jake.

2012
01:57:18,205 --> 01:57:20,624
Ghost of Ramadan Past,
Ghost of Hanukkah Yet-to-Come.

2013
01:57:20,707 --> 01:57:24,086
- It's a whole thing. You're gonna love it.
- We don't have the personnel for all this.

2014
01:57:24,169 --> 01:57:26,922
We're meeting later
about the ongoing self-care program.

2015
01:57:27,005 --> 01:57:28,632
I'd love you to stop by.

2016
01:57:29,299 --> 01:57:30,968
- Yes. Okay. All right.
- Good.

2017
01:57:31,051 --> 01:57:33,011
- I'll stop in.
- Okay, I look forward to it.

2018
01:57:33,095 --> 01:57:36,807
- Nice to see you, big sister.
- Hey, Clint. And then...

2019
01:57:36,890 --> 01:57:37,933
Boo.

2020
01:57:38,433 --> 01:57:39,434
What you working on?

2021
01:57:39,518 --> 01:57:41,478
This perp file is driving me nuts.

2022
01:57:41,562 --> 01:57:43,438
I just can't find a Heart string
we can grab onto.

2023
01:57:43,522 --> 01:57:44,648
Mind if I take a peek?

2024
01:57:44,731 --> 01:57:46,608
- Please.
- Great.

2025
01:57:46,692 --> 01:57:49,444
Just don't use it as an excuse
to come home late tonight.

2026
01:57:49,528 --> 01:57:51,113
Well, that hurts.

2027
01:57:51,196 --> 01:57:52,239
I will be early.

2028
01:57:54,449 --> 01:57:56,660
No, no, no, no, no.
You're a ghost. Let's get going.

2029
01:58:12,092 --> 01:58:14,678
Kim, this place looks amazing.

2030
01:58:14,761 --> 01:58:16,889
Clint, you know I can't see you. Can you…

2031
01:58:17,431 --> 01:58:19,391
I always forget. Sorry.

2032
01:58:20,601 --> 01:58:21,602
Hi.

2033
01:58:23,145 --> 01:58:25,397
- Nice to see ya.
- Nice to see you.

2034
01:58:26,648 --> 01:58:28,692
Well, come on in.
He's out back with the kids.

2035
01:58:28,775 --> 01:58:31,862
- Is it ready yet?
- Yeah, it's not ready yet.

2036
01:58:31,945 --> 01:58:33,780
- Is it done?
- But I can't build it,

2037
01:58:33,864 --> 01:58:36,992
if I keep dropping the damn screws
in the grass!

2038
01:58:37,075 --> 01:58:43,665
Hey, Ronny. Ronny, put that down. Ronny!
Ronald J. Fishman Pratt, put it down!

2039
01:58:44,249 --> 01:58:45,626
- Okay.
- That was bad.

2040
01:58:45,709 --> 01:58:47,794
Sorry, kids.
I didn't mean to shout. All right?

2041
01:58:47,878 --> 01:58:50,339
- Come on, bring it in. Come on.
- Uncle Clint!

2042
01:58:50,422 --> 01:58:51,924
Bring it in.

2043
01:58:52,007 --> 01:58:53,550
That never gets old. Okay. Hey.

2044
01:58:53,634 --> 01:58:55,093
He still comes out from time to time.

2045
01:58:55,177 --> 01:58:56,803
That's okay. Hey, I'm sorry to barge in.

2046
01:58:56,887 --> 01:58:59,097
I'm having a little trouble
with this file.

2047
01:58:59,181 --> 01:59:01,600
- You mind putting your eyes on it?
- No, not at all.

2048
01:59:01,683 --> 01:59:02,768
- Okay. Yeah?
- Yeah.

2049
01:59:02,851 --> 01:59:04,311
- Great. Thanks.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

2050
01:59:04,811 --> 01:59:07,189
Ronny! There's a bathroom inside.

2051
01:59:09,858 --> 01:59:12,444
You see that Wrenny
got into the master's program at Stanford?

2052
01:59:12,528 --> 01:59:13,529
Oh, yeah.

2053
01:59:13,612 --> 01:59:16,406
Owen texted me as soon as she got in.
I'm sure proud of that kid.

2054
01:59:18,617 --> 01:59:21,703
Told ya. This perp is a tough nut
to crack, isn't she?

2055
01:59:21,787 --> 01:59:23,747
Yeah. But wait, look. Look right there.

2056
01:59:23,830 --> 01:59:26,959
See that tiny flutter in her exposure?

2057
01:59:27,042 --> 01:59:29,503
- Butterflies.
- Butterflies. She was in love.

2058
01:59:30,087 --> 01:59:32,840
- No! Come on.
- Yeah.

2059
01:59:32,923 --> 01:59:35,926
- We've looked everywhere. When? With who?
- Well, you didn't look there.

2060
01:59:36,009 --> 01:59:38,720
In her early 20s. I don't know.
We have to find out with who.

2061
01:59:39,388 --> 01:59:40,556
With who. With "whom"?

2062
01:59:41,598 --> 01:59:43,141
Right. "With whom."

2063
01:59:43,225 --> 01:59:45,727
- Yeah, I think that sounds educated.
- With whom.

2064
01:59:46,395 --> 01:59:47,271
Yeah, sure.

2065
01:59:48,564 --> 01:59:50,190
- I hear that.
- I do too.

2066
01:59:50,899 --> 01:59:53,861
- It's a reprise?
- That... It's... Yeah, the... a reprise.

2067
01:59:53,944 --> 01:59:55,320
- Is it reprise?
- It's reprise.

2068
01:59:55,404 --> 01:59:56,947
- Or... It's reprise.
- Yes.

2119
02:03:05,469 --> 02:03:08,889
<i>Playing safe and thinking small
Doesn't move the ball at all</i>

2120
02:03:08,972 --> 02:03:12,851
<i>There's humanity to save</i>

2121
02:03:13,435 --> 02:03:17,356
<i>Can we really make a ripple</i>

2122
02:03:17,439 --> 02:03:21,276
<i>With our feet up while we float
Too afraid to rock the boat</i>

2123
02:03:21,360 --> 02:03:25,113
<i>If we never test the waters
We'll never know</i>

2124
02:03:25,197 --> 02:03:27,199
<i>Just how far the ripples go</i>

2125
02:03:27,991 --> 02:03:30,536
<i>Do you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple?</i>

2126
02:03:31,537 --> 02:03:33,830
<i>I think you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple</i>

2127
02:03:33,914 --> 02:03:36,250
Consider the consequences.

2128
02:03:36,333 --> 02:03:38,126
Consider the possibilities.

2129
02:03:40,212 --> 02:03:43,507
<i>Now, if we choose this dude
One goes to two then four</i>

2130
02:03:43,590 --> 02:03:45,884
<i>And then it jumps from four to eight</i>

2131
02:03:45,968 --> 02:03:47,594
<i>Ripple, ripple, ripple</i>

2132
02:03:47,678 --> 02:03:48,512
Yes!

2133
02:03:48,595 --> 02:03:51,765
<i>Soon, you guys
It multiplies to thousands more</i>

2134
02:03:51,849 --> 02:03:54,643
<i>Can you hear it reverberate?</i>

2135
02:03:54,726 --> 02:03:56,144
<i>Ripple, ripple, ripple</i>

2136
02:03:56,228 --> 02:03:59,398
<i>Then to millions and to billions
And it never ends</i>

2137
02:04:00,148 --> 02:04:04,111
<i>And all across the world
The change is gaining some traction</i>

2138
02:04:04,194 --> 02:04:05,487
<i>Reaching other planets</i>

2139
02:04:05,571 --> 02:04:07,114
<i>Maybe aliens</i>

2140
02:04:07,197 --> 02:04:12,494
<i>From one man we began a chain reaction</i>

2141
02:04:12,578 --> 02:04:14,788
<i>Ripple, do you wanna make a ripple?</i>

2142
02:04:15,289 --> 02:04:18,125
<i>Do you wanna make a ripple?
Ripple, ripple, ripple, ripple</i>

2143
02:04:18,208 --> 02:04:21,420
<i>If we wanna make a ripple</i>

2144
02:04:22,296 --> 02:04:25,632
<i>That could turn into a wave</i>

2145
02:04:26,216 --> 02:04:29,803
<i>Time to be what we're about
Gotta turn this mother out</i>

2146
02:04:29,887 --> 02:04:34,099
<i>-Friends, it's just called being brave
-It's just called being brave</i>

2147
02:04:34,183 --> 02:04:37,060
<i>We need more than just a ripple</i>

2148
02:04:37,978 --> 02:04:41,940
<i>Make the choice to take a chance
Let's put on our big boy pants</i>

2149
02:04:42,024 --> 02:04:45,569
<i>If we only skim the surface
We'll never know</i>

2150
02:04:45,652 --> 02:04:48,071
<i>Just how far the ripples go</i>

2151
02:04:48,697 --> 02:04:50,616
<i>Do you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple?</i>

2152
02:04:50,699 --> 02:04:52,868
<i>Do you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple?</i>

2153
02:04:52,951 --> 02:04:54,870
<i>Do you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple?</i>

2154
02:04:54,953 --> 02:04:57,331
<i>Do you wanna make
A ripple, ripple, ripple?</i>

2155
02:04:57,414 --> 02:05:01,043
<i>- Can we redeem the unredeemable?
- Is he redeemable?</i>

2156
02:05:01,126 --> 02:05:04,922
<i>Can we just risk it all
And find a way?</i>

2157
02:05:05,005 --> 02:05:08,967
<i>- Can we accomplish the impossible?
- Is it impossible?</i>

2158
02:05:09,051 --> 02:05:12,429
<i>Well, it's impossible to say</i>

2159
02:05:12,513 --> 02:05:16,099
<i>But I have to believe
Inside the worst of us</i>

2160
02:05:16,183 --> 02:05:18,685
<i>There is some decency there</i>

2161
02:05:18,769 --> 02:05:20,229
<i>Decency-cy-cy-cy-cy</i>

2162
02:05:20,312 --> 02:05:24,024
<i>I know that we can achieve
Something miraculous</i>

2163
02:05:24,107 --> 02:05:28,237
<i>-If we only dare
-Do we dare, do we dare?</i>

2164
02:05:28,320 --> 02:05:30,989
<i>-Damn right, I dare
-Yes, we dare</i>

2165
02:05:31,073 --> 02:05:34,618
<i>If we wanna make a ripple</i>

2166
02:05:35,160 --> 02:05:38,789
<i>Ripple out to make a wave</i>

2167
02:05:38,872 --> 02:05:42,918
<i>Then let's fry some bigger fish
Ask forgiveness, not "permish"</i>

2168
02:05:43,418 --> 02:05:46,255
<i>There's humanity to save</i>

2169
02:05:46,839 --> 02:05:50,884
<i>Can't resign yourself to ripples</i>

2170
02:05:50,968 --> 02:05:54,680
<i>'Cause you'll barely make a dent
Giving 99 percent</i>

2171
02:05:54,763 --> 02:06:00,102
<i>Go for broke
Because it's time that we finally know</i>

2172
02:06:00,727 --> 02:06:03,605
<i>Just how far the ripples go</i>

2173
02:06:30,924 --> 02:06:32,426
Okay, Mr. Ray Maddison,

2174
02:06:32,509 --> 02:06:35,637
elevators are right down the hall,
and here's the key card to your suite.

2175
02:06:35,721 --> 02:06:37,764
Hang on, don't look left, eyes on me.

2176
02:06:37,848 --> 02:06:39,516
There's a problem
and I will address it immediately.

2177
02:06:39,600 --> 02:06:40,976
Do not look left.

2178
02:06:41,059 --> 02:06:43,562
I'm gonna murder a man in the grand lobby.

2179
02:06:50,611 --> 02:06:51,945
Oh, no.
