01:32.794 --> 01:36.463
<i>contains just</i>
<i>a little bit of magic.</i>

01:36.531 --> 01:42.402

01:42.469 --> 01:45.873

[Mrs. LePage] Of course.
But please hear me out.

05:09.177 --> 05:12.814
I'm just asking your bank
for an extension on my loan
is all, Mr. Flint.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.284
You see, I'm selling
a great new toy this Christmas.

05:16.349 --> 05:17.552
Snow Buds.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.486
I just know
kids will love them.

05:19.554 --> 05:22.256
In fact, I'm hosting
a big party tomorrow

05:22.322 --> 05:24.692
to introduce these adorable
little guys to the world.

05:24.759 --> 05:28.663
After that, I'm sure
I'll have all the money
I owe the bank and then some.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.198
[Mr. Flint
speaking indistinctly]

05:30.264 --> 05:32.934
Oh, thank you, sir.

I appreciate that.

And I won't let you down.

05:39.207 --> 05:40.675
Oh, hello, Jerry.

05:40.741 --> 05:43.711
I see Doublevay's cat

You're just in time
to see my newest trick!

06:21.916 --> 06:23.483
Check this out.

06:23.551 --> 06:26.654
I can toss these rings
around that pole
from anywhere in the room.

06:26.721 --> 06:30.157
Really, anywhere. Like magic.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.827
Well, not like magic-magic.

06:32.894 --> 06:36.230
It's actually
all electromagnetic.

06:36.297 --> 06:37.497
I built it myself.

Now, wanna see
some real trick shots?

07:07.094 --> 07:08.428
Oh, I get it.

07:08.495 --> 07:10.631
You wanna wait till tomorrow
and see it at the big show

07:10.698 --> 07:14.235
I'm putting on
at Mrs. LePage's
Snow Bud party.

07:14.302 --> 07:15.703
I don't blame you, Uncle Jerry.

07:15.770 --> 07:18.205
Magic's always better
with a crowd.

07:21.275 --> 07:22.510
What is it?

07:22.576 --> 07:24.578
You don't want me
to put on a big show?

07:25.780 --> 07:27.048
Well, I guess I can lose

07:27.114 --> 07:28.616
the flaming trapeze.

07:30.685 --> 07:32.219
Wait, you don't want me

07:32.286 --> 07:34.021
putting on a show at all?

07:41.295 --> 07:42.797
[snake hissing]

07:45.399 --> 07:46.867
Hey, I talked that snake

07:46.934 --> 07:48.970
into spitting
all those mice out.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.138
Eventually.

07:57.411 --> 07:59.547
I did tell you not to flinch.

08:01.615 --> 08:03.784
I was doing a card trick.

08:03.851 --> 08:06.821
Still not sure
how that one happened.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.690
Yeah, I guess you're right,
Uncle J.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.226
Tomorrow's too important
for Mrs. LePage.

08:12.293 --> 08:13.694
I wouldn't want to mess it up.

08:28.576 --> 08:29.777
[wind howling]

08:29.844 --> 08:31.512
I know Uncle Jerry's
right and all,

08:31.579 --> 08:33.514
but I just wanted to help.

08:33.581 --> 08:35.383
Boy, I wish I wasn't

08:35.449 --> 08:37.451
always mucking stuff up

08:37.518 --> 08:40.688
If only I was better at magic.

08:40.755 --> 08:43.457
You know,
like honest-to-goodness magic.

08:43.524 --> 08:47.261
Like the kind of magic
they say is atop ol' Smiley.

08:56.037 --> 08:58.539
Bet that'd help Mrs. LePage.

09:00.174 --> 09:02.043
Ah, who am I kiddin'?

09:02.109 --> 09:04.412
Magic's just
kids' stuff anyway.

09:04.478 --> 09:07.248
[voice chuckles] I wouldn't be
too sure about that!

09:08.349 --> 09:09.617
[stutters] Hello?

09:10.418 --> 09:11.652
Is someone there?

09:11.719 --> 09:14.789
I don't know.
I thought we were alone.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.158
Hello? Anyone there?

09:17.224 --> 09:20.227
I'm warning you,
I am trained in snow fu.

09:26.901 --> 09:29.003
Please don't leave me
alone out here.

09:29.070 --> 09:31.205
I don't really know snow fu.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.242
Oh, don't worry, kid.

09:35.309 --> 09:36.243
I'll save you.

09:39.548 --> 09:40.915
[coughs, spits]

09:42.383 --> 09:44.318
I did it. Whoo-hoo!

09:44.385 --> 09:45.554
Oh, my gosh!

09:45.619 --> 09:47.655
You're a real snowmouse,
aren't you?

09:47.721 --> 09:49.457
[gasps] Like a magic snowmouse

09:49.524 --> 09:51.625
from the magic snow
atop Ol' Smiley?

09:51.692 --> 09:53.694
[gasps] Does that mean
magic is real?

09:53.761 --> 09:55.729
Then how does magic work?

09:55.796 --> 09:57.164
And don't snowmice need

09:57.231 --> 09:59.300
some kind of magic hat
to come to life, and--

09:59.366 --> 10:02.703
[chuckling] Whoa!
One question at a time, kiddo.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.739
Uh, let's see, uh...
Yes. Yes. Yes.

10:05.806 --> 10:06.674
I don't know.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.242
And no.

10:08.309 --> 10:10.811
[laughing] Why on Earth
would I wear a hat?

10:10.878 --> 10:13.548
A snowmouse's whole deal
is keeping cold!

10:13.614 --> 10:14.782
Wow!

10:14.849 --> 10:17.485

killed ya to give me
a little bit of muscle?

I mean, look at these biceps.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.183
Where's the definition?

Okay, buddy-o,

12:30.351 --> 12:32.386

Gee, must be an even
smaller town than I thought.

12:36.691 --> 12:38.660
Ha! Kidding!

12:38.727 --> 12:39.893
Hiya, Uncle J.

12:44.398 --> 12:46.568
Uh, oh, I just realized.

12:46.635 --> 12:47.935
You need a name.

12:48.002 --> 12:50.070
[chuckles] Now,
just a minute, kiddo,

12:50.137 --> 12:52.006
naming a snowmouse isn't easy.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.542
Name's gotta sound friendly,
but not frivolous.

How's Larry?

13:05.019 --> 13:08.389
Uncle Jerry's right.
It's not me. It's you.

some of my mountain snow.

while I'm at it?

13:34.214 --> 13:39.386

because these pythons
are sick!

Ah, freezing.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.469
I'm gonna sleep like a baby.

13:55.537 --> 13:57.371
That's 'cause I am a baby,

13:57.438 --> 13:59.641

a few hours old and all.

13:59.708 --> 14:03.043
Well, buddy-o, we got many,
many hours of fun ahead of us.

14:33.474 --> 14:37.277
This old snowmouse is magic,
remember? I'll be just fine.

14:43.818 --> 14:45.152
Yep, ol' buddy. [sighs]

14:45.219 --> 14:46.987
I'll be just fine.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.735
Got a good feeling
about today, Jerry.

15:00.802 --> 15:02.670
Even the weather
is pulling for us.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.276
Now for the main attraction.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.749
Heya, kid. Wanna be buds?

15:14.816 --> 15:17.084
Heya, kid. Wanna be buds?

15:17.151 --> 15:21.890
-[electricity crackling]
-Heya, kid? Wanna be--
buds-- Wanna be--

15:21.955 --> 15:24.958
[Doctor Doublevay] Wow,
look at that impressive tech.

15:25.025 --> 15:27.394
Oh, by the way,
the phone's for you.

15:27.461 --> 15:28.797
It's 1983,

15:28.863 --> 15:32.534
and they want their
animatronic pizza mascot
back. Ha!

15:35.135 --> 15:36.838
What do you want, Doublevay?

15:36.905 --> 15:38.606
Mary, please.

15:38.673 --> 15:41.910
I've been humiliating
your pathetic store
for years now.

15:41.975 --> 15:44.011
I think
we're on a first-name basis.

15:44.077 --> 15:46.614
Okay. Fine. What do you want...

15:46.681 --> 15:47.816
Uh-- Wait.

15:47.882 --> 15:50.083
What is your first name anyway?

15:50.150 --> 15:51.653
[sighs] Doctor.

15:51.719 --> 15:54.254
Your actual name is Doctor?

15:54.321 --> 15:57.725
Well, yes. My parents had
rather high expectations.

15:57.792 --> 16:01.962
But by becoming the number-one
toy inventor in the world,

16:02.029 --> 16:04.599
I've exceeded
their wildest dreams.

16:04.666 --> 16:06.601
[chuckles]

16:06.668 --> 16:10.237
Or at least,
I bet that's what they say
if they'd ever return my calls.

16:10.304 --> 16:11.238
Up high!

16:17.311 --> 16:20.782
And when you do inevitably
default on your loan,

16:20.849 --> 16:22.149
I've made arrangements

16:22.216 --> 16:23.885
to purchase
this building from the bank.

16:23.952 --> 16:25.285
[blows raspberry]

16:25.352 --> 16:27.555
Yeah, I... I plan
to convert it into something

16:27.622 --> 16:29.891
people will find
much more exciting...

16:29.958 --> 16:31.425
like a blank wall.

16:31.492 --> 16:32.426
[laughing]

16:34.995 --> 16:36.798
Tom.
What's the matter with you?

16:36.865 --> 16:38.600
Go clean yourself, man.

16:39.868 --> 16:41.201
[laughing]

16:42.737 --> 16:44.404
Well, hello, little one.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.073
Do you like the Snow Buds?

16:46.139 --> 16:48.141
Yeah. Does it talk?

16:48.208 --> 16:49.276
No, sweetheart.

16:49.343 --> 16:51.946
-Does it dance?
-No.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.581
Does it have Wi-Fi?

16:53.648 --> 16:54.549
No.

16:54.616 --> 16:56.985
Then... what does it do?

16:57.050 --> 16:59.754
A Snow Bud can do
anything you want it to.

16:59.821 --> 17:01.890
Because you are magical.

17:01.956 --> 17:03.390
I am?

17:03.457 --> 17:04.458
Of course.

17:04.526 --> 17:07.160
We all have
a little magic in us.

17:07.227 --> 17:09.664
The magic of imagination.

17:09.731 --> 17:11.031
You and your Snow Bud

17:11.098 --> 17:14.067
can go on all kinds
of fantastic adventures.

17:14.134 --> 17:15.737
[Doctor Doublevay] Imagination.

17:15.803 --> 17:17.037
Ha! You see that?

17:17.104 --> 17:19.707
She expects you
to do all the work.

17:19.774 --> 17:21.643
That's why you're a failure.

17:21.709 --> 17:26.113
Your entire business model
depends on the abilities
of puny-minded children.

17:26.179 --> 17:29.817
Oh, uh, not you.
Other puny-minded children.

17:34.288 --> 17:37.257
Well, this has been
great, Doctor.

17:37.324 --> 17:40.762
But if you'll excuse me,
it's about time
for my event to begin.

17:40.828 --> 17:44.364
Oh, I know
what time your event starts.

17:44.431 --> 17:48.435
[loud music playing]

17:50.270 --> 17:51.973
Because wouldn't you know it?

17:52.040 --> 17:55.043
It's the exact same time
my event starts.

17:55.108 --> 17:56.644
[kid 1] Cool!

17:56.711 --> 17:58.211
-[kid 2] Destroy-a-Matic 5000?
-[kid 3] Can I get one?

17:58.278 --> 18:00.748
[indistinct chatter]

18:11.793 --> 18:13.226
[car horn honks]

18:13.761 --> 18:14.829
[gasps]

18:19.601 --> 18:20.500
[laughing]

18:28.910 --> 18:30.344
[man snarling]

18:34.147 --> 18:35.883
One more cube oughta do it.

18:45.359 --> 18:47.662
Ooh, and we can't
forget the helmet.

18:51.899 --> 18:54.902
Gee, Tuffy, I don't know.

18:57.371 --> 19:00.608
I mean, fashionable,
functional and flattering?

19:00.675 --> 19:04.012
[chuckles] You sure
can work magic.

19:04.078 --> 19:05.880
Yeah. I wish.

19:05.947 --> 19:07.180
What do you mean?

19:07.247 --> 19:09.550
I actually want
to be a magician.

19:09.617 --> 19:12.620
I'm just not
very good at magic.

19:12.687 --> 19:14.421
Um, hello?

19:14.488 --> 19:16.390
Do you see
the talking mound of snow

19:16.456 --> 19:17.759
you brought to life?

19:17.825 --> 19:20.695
Come on, we both know
that wasn't me.

19:20.762 --> 19:23.163
It must've been the magic
from Ol' Smiley.

19:23.230 --> 19:24.732
Hmm. If you say so.

19:24.799 --> 19:27.835
Besides, I want
to perform magic.

19:27.902 --> 19:29.403
In fact, I was all set

19:29.469 --> 19:32.006
to put on a show to help
with Mrs. LePage's party,

19:32.073 --> 19:33.908
but Uncle Jerry reminded me

19:33.975 --> 19:38.946
my tricks sometimes tend
to... break... everything.

19:39.013 --> 19:40.414
And I'd just feel awful

19:40.480 --> 19:43.117
if I ruined
Mrs. LePage's big day.

19:43.183 --> 19:45.720
[laughs] Well, have I got
some great news.

19:45.787 --> 19:48.690
You don't need to worry
about ruining her big day,

19:48.756 --> 19:50.625
'cause it looks like
it's already ruined.

19:50.692 --> 19:52.426
-[loud music playing]
-[people cheering]

19:55.262 --> 19:57.765
Oh, no. No one's showed up.

19:57.832 --> 20:01.201
We have to do something
to help Mrs. LePage.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.335
You're right.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.505
We need to draw a crowd.

20:04.572 --> 20:06.908
I know exactly how to do that.

20:06.974 --> 20:09.544
You mean... perform my magic?

20:09.610 --> 20:12.847
Whoa! That's a great idea.

20:12.914 --> 20:14.716
No, I was gonna say
grab that chalk

20:14.782 --> 20:18.686
and actually draw a crowd
on the walls outside.

20:18.753 --> 20:21.122
You know, to make it look like
people actually showed up.

20:21.189 --> 20:23.858
But your idea's way better.

20:23.925 --> 20:25.425
I don't know, Larry.

20:25.492 --> 20:28.228
Oh, come on, Tuff.
Your friend needs help.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.131
And not to be that snowmouse,

20:30.198 --> 20:32.934
but her dud party
can't get any worse.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.035
You know what?

20:34.102 --> 20:36.403
You're right. Let's do it!

20:41.075 --> 20:43.644
I'll just need an assistant.

20:47.782 --> 20:48.448
Who?

20:48.516 --> 20:49.984
You, ya silly!

20:51.318 --> 20:52.587

21:58.252 --> 21:59.587

21:59.654 --> 22:02.924
the most amazing
spectacle of magic ever.

22:02.990 --> 22:05.492
The Great Tuffini!

22:05.560 --> 22:07.460
[woman] Hey,
would you look at that?

22:17.104 --> 22:18.471
[whirring]

22:25.313 --> 22:26.647
What do you say, kids?

22:26.714 --> 22:28.381
Should we try another?

22:34.322 --> 22:36.157
[laughs]

22:36.224 --> 22:37.825
Heya! Quit ticklin'.

22:44.232 --> 22:48.269
Now, for my next trick,
I, the Great Tuffini,

22:48.336 --> 22:50.403
will toss these rings
around that pole

22:50.470 --> 22:52.607
no matter
where my assistant holds it.

22:52.673 --> 22:56.143
And I'll do it blindfolded!

23:03.718 --> 23:05.385
[hair dryer whirring]

23:11.225 --> 23:12.392
[whispers] You okay, buddy-o?

23:12.459 --> 23:14.095
Of course I am.

23:14.161 --> 23:15.696
Must be nervous is all.

23:15.763 --> 23:17.164
Don't be.

23:17.231 --> 23:19.934
Just stand where I tell ya
and the magnets'll do the rest.

23:20.001 --> 23:21.903
[panting]

23:26.807 --> 23:29.744
[in normal voice] Are we ready,
my faithful assistant?

23:35.549 --> 23:36.751
Uh-oh.

I know you said not to.

I was only trying to help.

24:20.394 --> 24:22.462
Now, just a second, Uncle J.

24:22.530 --> 24:24.832
This was all my idea.

24:24.899 --> 24:26.567
And maybe it was a silly idea,

24:26.634 --> 24:30.938
but our hearts
were in the right place,
weren't they, Tuff?

24:31.005 --> 24:34.141

you've never done
anything silly in your life.

27:08.062 --> 27:10.698
I'll have
this month's bank payment
just like I promised.

27:10.764 --> 27:14.668
Heck, I'll even have enough
for this whole year's payment.

27:15.504 --> 27:16.470

27:16.538 --> 27:18.573
No, you can't have it now.

Oh, you did it, Larry!

27:20.674 --> 27:23.477
You saved Mrs. LePage's store.

We all did it, buddy-o.

as that get-up was,

that's no way
for a snowmouse to live.

27:40.828 --> 27:42.363
I guess I'll just
have to accept the fact

27:42.429 --> 27:43.697
that in a couple of days,

27:43.764 --> 27:46.066
I'll be nothin' but a puddle.

like one a kid can splash in.

27:51.540 --> 27:53.073
Cut it out, Larry.

27:53.140 --> 27:55.910
We'd never let that happen
to you, right, Uncle Jerry?

27:57.278 --> 27:59.614
Oh, I don't see
what choice we have.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.448
I mean, snow melts.

28:01.516 --> 28:02.816
That's what it does.

28:02.883 --> 28:04.553
It's not like
there's some magical place

28:04.619 --> 28:05.819
where a snowmouse like me

28:05.886 --> 28:08.789
could literally chill out
year round.

28:08.856 --> 28:10.559
Wait, that's it.

28:10.625 --> 28:12.426
Yes, there is, Larry!

28:12.493 --> 28:14.195
Snowman's Land!

28:14.261 --> 28:15.362
Come again?

28:15.429 --> 28:16.565
Don't you get it?

28:16.631 --> 28:17.965
Mount Felicity.

28:18.032 --> 28:19.867
The magic of Ol' Smiley?

28:19.934 --> 28:21.402
It's all true!

28:21.468 --> 28:22.970
You're living proof.

28:23.037 --> 28:24.438
And if you're for real,

28:24.506 --> 28:25.640
that means the legend

28:25.706 --> 28:26.874
of Snowman's Land

28:26.941 --> 28:28.577
must be real, too!

28:28.643 --> 28:30.311
Snowman's Land?

28:30.377 --> 28:34.448
Snowman's Land
is a magical village
atop Mount Felicity,

28:34.516 --> 28:37.218
<i>in the center</i>
<i>of Ol' Smiley's valley.</i>

28:37.284 --> 28:40.287
<i>The snow up there</i>
<i>is supposed to be magic.</i>

28:40.354 --> 28:43.157
<i>And I bet</i>
<i>that's where you came from.</i>

28:43.224 --> 28:46.794
<i>Snowmen, snowwomen, snowkids!</i>

28:46.860 --> 28:48.796
You mean, others like me?

28:48.862 --> 28:50.197
Why, sure.

28:50.264 --> 28:52.900
What are we waiting for?
Let's go!

28:52.967 --> 28:54.569
What do you say, Uncle Jerry?

28:54.636 --> 28:55.836
Can we go?

28:56.937 --> 28:59.006
Yeah, I know it's a long shot,

28:59.073 --> 29:01.275
but it's Larry's only shot.

29:02.611 --> 29:04.512
Oh, please, Uncle Jerry?

29:04.579 --> 29:08.482
[both] Please, please,
please, please, please,
please, please, please...

29:13.555 --> 29:14.723
[both] Yay!

29:14.788 --> 29:16.924
We're going to Snowman's Land!

29:18.425 --> 29:19.793
What is that thing?

29:19.860 --> 29:22.263
Is it AI?
Some kind of nano-gear?

29:22.329 --> 29:24.064
And where would old lady LePage

29:24.131 --> 29:27.234
even get that kind of tech
to use for one of her toys?

29:31.772 --> 29:33.073
Magic?

29:33.140 --> 29:35.644
Oh, don't be absurd,
you vacuous pillock.

29:35.710 --> 29:37.111
But I promise you this.

29:37.177 --> 29:39.514
Whatever secret tech it uses,

29:39.581 --> 29:41.115
we're going to find it out.

29:41.181 --> 29:44.351
Oh, indeed, we will find out.

29:44.418 --> 29:48.523
[laughing maniacally]

29:49.356 --> 29:50.525
What?

29:50.592 --> 29:52.527
[Tuffy] Climbing that mountain
won't be easy.

29:52.594 --> 29:55.896
At least it'll be cold
and I won't have
to worry about melting.

29:55.963 --> 29:56.997
That's true.

29:57.064 --> 29:58.365
Then I'd say the bigger problem

29:58.432 --> 30:00.868
is getting to the mountain
before you melt.

30:00.934 --> 30:03.937
If only we had
a faster way across town.

30:04.706 --> 30:06.140
Please, Uncle Jerry.

30:08.576 --> 30:10.044
It's the only way.

30:10.110 --> 30:12.514
Please. For me?

30:22.256 --> 30:24.258
Uncle Jerry's pride and joy.

30:24.325 --> 30:26.695
An RC Speed Queen convertible.

30:26.761 --> 30:27.796
Fully loaded.

30:27.861 --> 30:29.564
Four synchronous
electric motors.

30:29.631 --> 30:31.198
Real working headlights.

30:31.265 --> 30:35.336
Goes from zero to eight
in three seconds.

30:35.402 --> 30:36.837
Wow!

30:39.173 --> 30:40.441
Don't you worry, Uncle Jerry.

30:40.508 --> 30:42.744
I know how much
this car means to you,

30:42.811 --> 30:45.012
and we promise
to act responsibly

30:45.079 --> 30:48.215
and be on our best behavior
at all times.

30:51.619 --> 30:53.987
[Tuffy and Larry whooping]

30:54.054 --> 30:55.155
[Larry] Punch it up to eight!

31:09.671 --> 31:11.806
Heya, kid? Wanna be buds?

31:11.872 --> 31:13.207
[screams]

31:13.675 --> 31:15.543
[exhales]

31:15.610 --> 31:18.112
[Doctor Doublevay] A-ha!
Well done, Tom.

31:18.178 --> 31:21.750
It looks as though our friends
took a little road trip.

31:21.816 --> 31:24.251
What do you say
we join 'em, hmm?

31:24.318 --> 31:26.621
Tom, to the Doublevehicle.

31:28.857 --> 31:32.359
Wow, I guess this baby does
guzzle batteries pretty quick.

31:39.233 --> 31:41.870
Heya, kid, what do you say
we stretch our legs a little

31:41.935 --> 31:44.271
and toss the old disc
back and forth?

31:46.741 --> 31:49.176
Gee, Jerry wanted us to stay--

31:49.677 --> 31:50.545
Larry?

31:56.083 --> 31:58.919
[music playing on speakers]

32:01.756 --> 32:03.056
That's it, buddy-o.

32:03.123 --> 32:06.026
Just let your wrist
go slack, and flick.

32:08.362 --> 32:09.930
All right. Throw some heat.

32:09.997 --> 32:13.033
Let's see that ol' patented
Larry Speed Snap in action.

32:13.100 --> 32:14.669
Here goes nothin'!

32:15.570 --> 32:16.437
There it is.

32:17.605 --> 32:19.039
And there it goes.

32:20.608 --> 32:21.609
Oh, no!

32:23.010 --> 32:24.211
[screams]

32:25.747 --> 32:27.247
I'm so dead.

32:28.650 --> 32:30.484
I am so dead.

32:30.552 --> 32:32.754
Relax. You can barely
even see it.

32:32.821 --> 32:34.221
You don't understand.

32:34.288 --> 32:35.757
Uncle Jerry'll see it.

32:35.824 --> 32:37.458
In fact, he loves
his car so much,

32:37.525 --> 32:39.326
he's probably
already sensed it.

32:42.429 --> 32:45.132
Don't you worry, Tuffster,
this'll buff out easy.

32:46.467 --> 32:47.869
Oh, wait.

32:47.936 --> 32:50.672
[Larry] Mm.
Probably should've
used a clean napkin.

32:53.741 --> 32:54.676
Oops!

32:54.742 --> 32:56.176
"Oops"? What's oops?

32:56.243 --> 32:57.211
You can't say--

32:57.277 --> 32:59.581
[gasps] What did you do?

33:00.548 --> 33:01.683
Okay. To be fair,

33:01.749 --> 33:05.219
I did not realize
this was a plastic laminate.

33:05.285 --> 33:07.889
But don't worry,
I'll figure something out.

33:07.956 --> 33:09.356
You just relax, partner.

33:10.758 --> 33:11.960
That's it. You lie down.

33:12.025 --> 33:13.628
Ol' Larry'll
think of something.

33:15.095 --> 33:18.131
Oh, Larry, you genius, you.

33:22.971 --> 33:24.238
Uncle Jerry, can I just say

33:24.304 --> 33:26.841
I honestly thought
I was doing you a favor.

33:26.908 --> 33:28.208
I mean, it's Christmas!

33:28.275 --> 33:31.311
What better way
to get into the spirit?

33:31.378 --> 33:34.248
Uh, maybe let this one go, Lar.

33:48.663 --> 33:50.163
Ah, they've been here.

33:50.230 --> 33:51.498
But we'll never catch him

33:51.566 --> 33:53.668
if we remain
one step behind like this.

33:53.735 --> 33:56.771
What do you say
we get a bird's eye view?

33:58.138 --> 33:59.641
Thomas, get off of me.

33:59.707 --> 34:02.977
I meant
a Destroy-A-Matic 5000's
eye view.

34:03.043 --> 34:04.444
[beeps]

34:07.949 --> 34:09.851
Yes. Fly, my children.

34:09.918 --> 34:11.184
Fly! Fly!

34:11.251 --> 34:12.987
[laughing maniacally]

34:13.053 --> 34:14.488
[slurping]

34:14.556 --> 34:16.490
Oh, what are you
looking at, Pops?

34:18.026 --> 34:19.393
[beeping]

34:21.029 --> 34:23.665
A-ha! Found them.
Let's go, Tom.

34:24.866 --> 34:26.734
[tires screeching]

34:31.906 --> 34:34.074
Nice try, but no freeloaders.

34:34.141 --> 34:35.543
Now, are you coming or not?

34:37.045 --> 34:39.112
[tires screeching]

34:40.180 --> 34:41.616
Would ya look at us?

34:41.683 --> 34:45.053
Three best buds on the road,
not a care in the world.

34:45.118 --> 34:46.988
Hey! You know what we need?

34:47.055 --> 34:48.155
Tunes!

34:48.221 --> 34:50.223
[Jerry's stomach growls]

34:50.290 --> 34:52.192
Huh.
What kind of music is this?

34:52.259 --> 34:54.062
No, Larry.
That's Jerry's stomach.

34:54.127 --> 34:55.329
He must be hungry.

34:55.395 --> 34:57.264
And so am I, actually.

35:00.434 --> 35:02.837
Mm. Let's see what we...

35:02.904 --> 35:04.005
got?

35:04.072 --> 35:05.540
Where's our food?

35:05.607 --> 35:08.676
Stay calm.
I know exactly where it is.

35:09.242 --> 35:10.812
It's in my tummy.

35:10.878 --> 35:12.680
You ate everything?

35:12.747 --> 35:14.983
Well, not the wrappers,
obviously.

35:15.049 --> 35:16.383
Unless I'm supposed to.

35:16.450 --> 35:18.886
I mean, this eating thing
is new to me--

35:18.953 --> 35:20.320
Larry!

35:20.387 --> 35:23.290
Sorry. I had to try everything
while I could.

35:23.357 --> 35:24.959
I doubt Snowman's Land will--

35:25.026 --> 35:26.728
No, you don't understand.

35:26.794 --> 35:28.328
We're not magic snowmice.

35:28.395 --> 35:30.865
We need food... to live.

35:30.932 --> 35:32.165
[gasps]

35:32.232 --> 35:34.134
You needed it to live?

35:34.201 --> 35:36.169
Oh, no. What have I done?

35:36.236 --> 35:37.772
[sobs] What have I done?

35:37.839 --> 35:40.908
I've doomed
my two bestest pals
in the world!

35:40.975 --> 35:41.876
Doomed!

35:41.943 --> 35:43.745
Why? Take me!

35:43.811 --> 35:45.245
No, no, no, Larry.

35:45.312 --> 35:47.115
We don't need food right away.

35:47.180 --> 35:48.783
Just eventually.

35:48.850 --> 35:51.184
Oh. In that case,
pull over here, Uncle Jerry.

35:51.251 --> 35:52.352
I got a plan.

35:54.287 --> 35:56.423
[Larry] See?
I told you I had a plan.

35:56.490 --> 35:58.993
And how can you beat
all you can eat?

35:59.060 --> 36:00.762
[rumbling]

36:00.828 --> 36:01.896
[straining]

36:01.963 --> 36:03.765
Come on, guys,
I know it's a dumpster,

36:03.831 --> 36:05.133
but are we not mice?

36:05.198 --> 36:07.501
Let's get in touch
with those rodent roots.

36:12.439 --> 36:15.076
Look, I found a nugget!

36:15.143 --> 36:16.410
-[gasps]
-[hissing]

36:16.476 --> 36:18.278
No, no, we're good. We're good.

36:18.345 --> 36:19.881
Your nugget. Your nugget.

36:22.784 --> 36:24.118
Mm! Wow!

36:24.184 --> 36:26.154
Ooh, Tuffy, you gotta try this.

36:26.219 --> 36:28.856
Must be some kind of dessert.

36:28.923 --> 36:31.358
Actually, I think someone
threw out their gum

36:31.425 --> 36:33.127
in a honey-mustard tub.

36:33.193 --> 36:34.962
Oh, gross.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.333
Phew.
It's gettin' warmer, guys.

36:40.400 --> 36:42.704
Better find a way to cool down.

36:42.770 --> 36:43.905
Whoo! There we go.

36:49.276 --> 36:51.779
Well, well,
what do we have here?

36:51.846 --> 36:55.116
Ooh, looks like we got us
a couple of mouses.

36:55.183 --> 36:57.250
Eh, hold up. A couple?

36:57.317 --> 36:58.586
Wait--

36:58.653 --> 37:01.288
Uh, how many is a couple again?

37:01.354 --> 37:02.222
Two.

37:02.289 --> 37:04.058
[grunts twice]

37:04.125 --> 37:05.258
Checks out.

37:05.325 --> 37:07.427
You see, this is our home.

37:07.494 --> 37:08.863
And how would you like it

37:08.930 --> 37:11.966
if you's caught someone
stealin' from your home?

37:13.067 --> 37:14.569
We don't like it neither.

37:14.635 --> 37:18.039
Lightning, tell 'em
what happens to stealers.

37:18.106 --> 37:19.140
Ahem.

37:19.207 --> 37:21.341
According to Dumpster-Cat code,

37:21.408 --> 37:23.511
item seven, section nine,

37:23.578 --> 37:27.481
any mouses caught stealin'
shall be summarily penalized,

37:27.548 --> 37:30.952
and vis-a-vis,
hereby sentenced to, uh--

37:31.018 --> 37:31.986
Oh--

37:32.053 --> 37:34.088
Just eat 'em already, Butch!

37:34.155 --> 37:36.624
Hey! You leave my uncle alone.

37:39.259 --> 37:41.629
What was that?
Somethin' bumped my knee.

37:41.696 --> 37:44.165
Any of you fellas
feel a breeze?

37:44.232 --> 37:46.601
[all chuckling]

37:48.002 --> 37:50.037
Ah. That's the stuff.

37:55.009 --> 37:56.376
Wow, fellas.

37:56.443 --> 37:58.513
A shake bath
can really open up those pores.

37:59.379 --> 38:01.414
Hey, who are your new friends?

38:01.481 --> 38:03.416
Six mouses?

38:04.619 --> 38:05.853
[whispering indistinctly]

38:05.920 --> 38:06.687
Really?

38:06.754 --> 38:08.488
That's what comes after two?

38:08.556 --> 38:10.825
Uh, three mouses?

38:16.296 --> 38:17.297
I'm Larry.

38:17.364 --> 38:18.866
Nice to meet ya. Whoa!

38:18.933 --> 38:21.702
Say there, Butch,
anymore mouses show up

38:21.769 --> 38:23.638
and you're gonna run
out of paws.

38:23.704 --> 38:25.573
You know,
your pal's right there, Butch.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.508
You got some sense of balance.

38:27.575 --> 38:29.210
Pfft. That's a fact.

38:29.277 --> 38:32.513
I mean, clearly, you must be
some kinda dancer, right?

38:32.580 --> 38:34.682
No. Uh, not really.

38:34.749 --> 38:38.351
I mean, not like I had
formal training or anything.

38:38.418 --> 38:39.620
What do you mean?

38:39.687 --> 38:41.055
Well, over the years,

38:41.122 --> 38:44.025
I kind of developed
my own style, you know?

38:44.091 --> 38:47.427
Kind of an acro-jazz,
hip-hop fusion

38:47.494 --> 38:50.565

51:24.886 --> 51:26.588
Tuffy, Jerry, now!

51:28.957 --> 51:30.190
[whistles]

51:32.092 --> 51:33.260
[yells]

51:41.201 --> 51:43.470
[screaming]

51:48.843 --> 51:49.777
[shushes]

51:52.179 --> 51:53.748
Be careful, Uncle Jerr--

51:53.815 --> 51:54.916
Whoa! Whoa!

51:54.983 --> 51:56.216
[grunts]

52:00.655 --> 52:01.956
Uncle Jerry.

52:02.023 --> 52:04.726
[giggling] Did you see the look
on Doublevay's face?

52:05.225 --> 52:06.326
Did ya?

52:07.227 --> 52:10.163
[screaming]

52:10.999 --> 52:12.499
Aw, snowballs.

52:20.875 --> 52:22.209
Wait, Jerry, don't--

52:30.183 --> 52:31.184
[straining]

52:31.251 --> 52:32.152
Jerry?

52:32.219 --> 52:33.755
Hold on. I got ya!

52:39.426 --> 52:40.662
[sighs in relief]

52:46.400 --> 52:48.670
Oh, thank goodness you're okay.

52:55.576 --> 52:58.211
I'll admit, Uncle Jerry,
not my best plan,

52:58.278 --> 53:00.148
but it could've gone
a lot worse--

53:00.213 --> 53:01.616
[crashing]

53:05.653 --> 53:08.623
Oh, Uncle Jerry,
this is all my fault.

53:08.690 --> 53:11.526
I should've never
talked you guys into this.

53:11.592 --> 53:14.327
I was just trying
to show you and Tuffy--

53:16.030 --> 53:17.532
-Where's Tuffy?
-[screams]

53:30.210 --> 53:32.914
Oh, Larry. What have you done?

53:37.585 --> 53:38.619
[coughs]

53:39.252 --> 53:40.655
Uncle Jerry?

53:42.322 --> 53:43.658
[coughs]

53:43.725 --> 53:46.426
Those weren't really reindeer,
were they?

53:49.262 --> 53:52.700
Oh, boy, Larry.
You've had better ideas.

53:54.068 --> 53:54.936
Larry?

53:56.804 --> 53:57.872
Where's Larry?

53:57.939 --> 53:59.707
Larry. Where'd he go?

54:02.844 --> 54:06.246
That toy mouse
and his detestable rat friends

54:06.313 --> 54:07.915
will rue the day they crossed

54:07.982 --> 54:10.985
Doctor Lawyer
Oil-Tycoon Doublevay.

54:11.052 --> 54:14.454
Oh, this isn't
about secret tech anymore.

54:14.522 --> 54:16.456
This is about revenge.

54:16.524 --> 54:18.192
Double revenge.

54:18.258 --> 54:19.927
[laughs maniacally]

54:20.327 --> 54:21.361
Oh, Tom!

54:21.428 --> 54:23.330
Oh, thank goodness you're okay.

54:23.396 --> 54:25.432
I was so worried.

54:25.499 --> 54:27.935
Wait. You don't think
I abandoned you?

54:30.138 --> 54:31.539
No, no, no, no, no.

54:31.606 --> 54:34.675
Um, I'm actually on hold
with the police right now.

54:34.742 --> 54:37.111
Yeah, I was alerting them
of your disappearance.

54:37.178 --> 54:38.946
Hello, Officer?

54:39.013 --> 54:40.313
Yes, I'm still here.

54:40.380 --> 54:42.984
And guess what?
It's a Christmas miracle.

54:43.050 --> 54:47.088
My sweet, precious Tom
is safe and sound.

54:47.155 --> 54:48.321
[camera shutter clicks]

54:49.356 --> 54:51.626
There, now, no hard feelings?

54:53.127 --> 54:55.062
Good. Come on. I need you.

54:55.129 --> 54:59.100
We're going back to town
to pick up a little surprise
for our bestest pals.

54:59.167 --> 55:01.401
Larry? Larry?

55:02.870 --> 55:05.506
We don't even know
if he went this way,
Uncle Jerry.

55:05.573 --> 55:07.809
He could be anywhere
on this mountain.

55:10.377 --> 55:12.013
Oh, where could he be?

55:14.682 --> 55:17.251
I'm the worst
magical snowmouse ever.

55:17.317 --> 55:20.121
You know, I don't know
if Snowman's Land is even real,

55:20.188 --> 55:21.823
but part of me didn't care.

55:21.889 --> 55:23.958
I was having so much fun
with my friends

55:24.025 --> 55:26.393
and just look
what I did to 'em. [sniffles]

55:26.459 --> 55:28.229
They probably hate me.

55:28.296 --> 55:29.931
And I don't blame them.

55:29.997 --> 55:31.364
[sobbing]

55:31.431 --> 55:32.633
Easy, Larry.

55:32.700 --> 55:34.635
You're being
too hard on yourself.

55:34.702 --> 55:36.369
You made one mistake.

55:37.238 --> 55:39.040
Oh, I make lots of mistakes.

55:39.106 --> 55:40.340
I know it's hard to believe

55:40.407 --> 55:41.742
'cause you look at me
and think,

55:41.809 --> 55:43.811
here's this adorable,
charismatic,

55:43.878 --> 55:46.914
compassionate snowmouse
with a razor sharp wit

55:46.981 --> 55:48.415
and a big heart to match.

55:48.481 --> 55:49.750
Rugged, bad boy looks

55:49.817 --> 55:52.086
that betray
a sophisticated soft side.

55:52.153 --> 55:54.055
We all make mistakes, Larry.

55:54.121 --> 55:58.326
Listen, what do you say
we put Jerry and Tuffy
out of our minds, huh?

55:58.391 --> 55:59.594
I guess.

55:59.660 --> 56:02.163
I mean, it hurts
to even hear their names.

56:02.230 --> 56:03.598
Jerry and Tuffy?

56:03.664 --> 56:06.033
Twist the knife,
why don't you, Floyd?

56:06.100 --> 56:08.536
No, I mean, Jerry and Tuffy.

56:08.603 --> 56:10.571
Aren't those your buddies
down there?

56:13.174 --> 56:14.942
Can't quite make 'em out.

56:15.509 --> 56:16.711
It's them!

56:16.777 --> 56:18.546
Well, they must be
looking for me.

56:18.613 --> 56:19.814
Whatever they're doing,

56:19.881 --> 56:21.916
they're headed
for a world of hurt.

56:21.983 --> 56:25.553
That down there is the way
to Coyote Springs.

56:25.620 --> 56:30.725
And guess what two things
they'll find down there?

56:30.791 --> 56:33.761
Cyborg trolls and snake people.

56:33.828 --> 56:35.062
What? No.

56:35.129 --> 56:36.530
Why would I--

56:36.597 --> 56:38.431
Listen to the name
again, Larry.

56:38.498 --> 56:41.869
Coyote Springs.

56:41.936 --> 56:43.271
Springs, huh?

56:43.337 --> 56:45.172
[gulps]

56:45.239 --> 56:47.909
Uh, any chance they're talking
about the fun boing-boing
kind of springs?

56:48.576 --> 56:50.745
[steam hissing]

56:54.015 --> 56:57.852
No way Larry could go anywhere
near these hot springs.

56:57.919 --> 56:58.920
Let's backtrack.

57:01.889 --> 57:02.556
Oh, no.

57:02.623 --> 57:04.058
[snarling]

57:04.125 --> 57:05.326
Uncle Jerry,

57:05.393 --> 57:06.493
I'm sorry I got you
into all this.

57:06.560 --> 57:08.495
I'm sorry
about a lot of things.

57:08.562 --> 57:10.665
Like always breaking
your things with my magic

57:10.731 --> 57:12.033
and never cleaning my room,

57:12.099 --> 57:14.001
and for making up that story
about a lion

57:14.068 --> 57:16.537
escaping from the circus
and eating an entire wheel

57:16.604 --> 57:18.973
of your expensive
caciocavallo cheese.

57:19.040 --> 57:20.007
[inhales]

57:20.074 --> 57:21.075
It was me.

57:22.543 --> 57:24.444
[growling]

57:25.146 --> 57:26.814
Yee-haw!

57:26.881 --> 57:27.982
Larry!

57:29.449 --> 57:30.384
Don't worry, buddies.

57:30.450 --> 57:31.585
I'll save ya.

57:31.652 --> 57:33.821
Hey! Fang-face! Over here.

57:39.060 --> 57:39.994
[snarling]

57:43.531 --> 57:45.099
[howling in pain]

57:45.967 --> 57:47.068
[Larry] Yoo-hoo!

57:59.246 --> 58:00.581
Oh!

58:00.648 --> 58:03.884
Now I get why they call it
Coyote Springs.

58:04.484 --> 58:05.686
[snarling]

58:05.753 --> 58:08.422
Uh, n-nice coyote.

58:08.488 --> 58:10.124
Here, boy! You want the ball?

58:13.027 --> 58:13.961
Want it?

58:14.028 --> 58:15.663
Then go fetch!

58:19.266 --> 58:20.701
[Tuffy] Larry, you did it.

58:20.768 --> 58:22.436
Piece of cake. [groans]

58:22.502 --> 58:25.973
But I don't think
I'll be doing that trick
again anytime soon.

58:26.040 --> 58:29.410
Oh, you guys, I'm sorry
I messed up so bad.

58:29.477 --> 58:33.781
Larry, you risked your life
coming to these springs
to save us.

58:33.848 --> 58:36.917
You really are my bestest pal.

58:36.984 --> 58:37.985
I sure am.

58:40.388 --> 58:42.923
Look, but maybe we can talk
about how great I am

58:42.990 --> 58:46.227
after we leave the land
of the exploding fountains?

58:46.293 --> 58:47.595
Oh, right.

58:47.661 --> 58:49.196
Now, come on.

58:49.263 --> 58:51.365
Floyd said he'd take us
all the way up to Ol' Smiley.

58:51.432 --> 58:52.533
That's right.

58:52.600 --> 58:53.968
All aboard!

58:54.035 --> 58:57.405
The Reindeer Express
is leaving the station.

58:57.471 --> 59:00.107
Snowman's Land, here we come!

59:03.210 --> 59:05.312
[wind howling]

59:05.379 --> 59:07.715
[both shivering]

59:09.717 --> 59:11.952
[cheerful music playing]

59:13.587 --> 59:15.790
[tense music playing]

59:18.592 --> 59:20.294
[rumbling]

59:20.361 --> 59:22.563
[cheerful music playing]

59:23.831 --> 59:26.100
[suspenseful music playing]

59:29.503 --> 59:30.704
[Tuffy gasps]

59:35.443 --> 59:37.645
[cheerful music playing]

59:41.215 --> 59:43.284
[wind howling]

1:00:01.402 --> 1:00:03.737
Looks like
the end of the line for me.

1:00:03.804 --> 1:00:08.409
But pipsqueaks like you
ought to be able to climb
the rest of the way just fine.

1:00:08.476 --> 1:00:10.211
Well, thanks, good buddy.

1:00:14.281 --> 1:00:15.850
I'd worry about
you getting home,

1:00:15.916 --> 1:00:17.952
but since
you're one of Santa's reindeer,

1:00:18.018 --> 1:00:20.054
you can just fly yourself down.

1:00:20.121 --> 1:00:21.755
Larry, really?

1:00:21.822 --> 1:00:23.691
You still belie--

1:00:23.757 --> 1:00:26.393
Don't you think
I would have flown us--

1:00:28.796 --> 1:00:30.364
No, you're right.

1:00:30.431 --> 1:00:32.567
I'll fly down. Later.

1:00:32.633 --> 1:00:34.768
Right now,
I could use the cardio.

1:00:36.971 --> 1:00:39.240
We're almost there! Come on!

1:00:41.876 --> 1:00:43.244
Sorry, Uncle Jerry.

1:00:43.310 --> 1:00:46.280
It's just that
if Snowman's Land is real,

1:00:46.347 --> 1:00:50.651
then I guess I'm just afraid
to say goodbye to Larry.

1:00:52.186 --> 1:00:55.156
Yeah, I know.
It's for the best.

1:00:55.222 --> 1:00:57.958
And you're right.
We'll always have each other.

1:00:58.025 --> 1:00:59.293
[Larry] You guys. Come here!

1:00:59.360 --> 1:01:01.495
[Tuffy] What is it?
DId you find it?

1:01:01.563 --> 1:01:03.430
Is it Snowman's Land?

1:01:03.497 --> 1:01:05.199
You tell me, buddy-o!

1:01:06.667 --> 1:01:08.603
[Tuffy] It is real.

1:01:08.669 --> 1:01:11.372
And it's amazing.

1:01:11.438 --> 1:01:13.007
Wow.

1:01:13.073 --> 1:01:15.544
I mean, it's no
Marty's Super-tastic
Wintertime Park,

1:01:15.610 --> 1:01:17.344
but wow.

1:01:17.411 --> 1:01:19.313
What are we waiting for?

1:01:26.921 --> 1:01:29.390
Larry? What's wrong?
We're here.

1:01:29.456 --> 1:01:32.860
Yeah, I know,
but what if they don't like me?

1:01:32.927 --> 1:01:33.961
Are you kidding?

1:01:34.028 --> 1:01:35.763
What's not to like?

1:01:39.300 --> 1:01:41.769
No, I meant,
what if they don't like me

1:01:41.835 --> 1:01:43.771
because they love me?

1:01:43.837 --> 1:01:45.806
Which, let's face it,
I'm pretty lovable.

1:01:45.873 --> 1:01:48.577
And if they love me,
I'll love them.

1:01:48.643 --> 1:01:50.010
Then I'll wanna stay here,

1:01:50.077 --> 1:01:52.079
but you'll have to...

1:01:57.851 --> 1:01:59.853
You're my bestest pal, buddy-o.

1:01:59.920 --> 1:02:02.890
But we both know
you belong here.

1:02:02.957 --> 1:02:04.892
It's the only way
you can stay alive.

1:02:04.959 --> 1:02:08.896
We just have to believe
that if magic brought us
together once...

1:02:08.963 --> 1:02:11.498
It'll do it again someday.

1:02:11.566 --> 1:02:13.234
You're right, Tuffster.

1:02:13.300 --> 1:02:15.502
[Snow Mayor] Well,
hello there, little ones!

1:02:15.570 --> 1:02:17.938
Welcome to Snowman's Land.

1:02:18.005 --> 1:02:20.040
We're the Welcoming Committee!

1:02:20.107 --> 1:02:22.009
My name's Mayor Berg.

1:02:22.076 --> 1:02:23.645
You must be new in town.

1:02:23.712 --> 1:02:26.113
I sure am. My name's Larry.

1:02:26.180 --> 1:02:27.448
Larry!

1:02:27.515 --> 1:02:30.150
Hmm. My, what a friendly name.

1:02:30.217 --> 1:02:33.320
I'm Tuffy.
And this is my Uncle Jerry.

1:02:34.421 --> 1:02:35.422
Jerry, eh?

1:02:35.489 --> 1:02:37.692
Hmm,
a little derivative of Larry,

1:02:37.791 --> 1:02:40.127
but welcome all the same.

1:02:40.194 --> 1:02:42.329

Larry, you simply must tell us
all about your adventures.

Where do we even start?

1:03:59.406 --> 1:04:02.409
I mean, we ate trash burgers,
did magic tricks,

1:04:02.476 --> 1:04:03.712

1:04:03.778 --> 1:04:06.548
Oh, and this weirdo

Mayor Berg! Mayor Berg!

1:04:08.683 --> 1:04:12.386

some sort of contraption
approaching Ol' Smiley.

Mayor, we're hitting him

1:05:02.637 --> 1:05:04.104
What do we do?

1:05:04.171 --> 1:05:07.174
Did we try putting
chunks of ice in the snowballs?

1:05:07.241 --> 1:05:09.443
Because those really hurt.

1:05:09.511 --> 1:05:10.879
Good thinking, sir!

1:05:10.944 --> 1:05:12.647
We have to do something.

1:05:16.483 --> 1:05:18.620
[Tuffy] Good idea, Uncle Jerry!

1:05:18.686 --> 1:05:22.356
If we can get that phone,
we can shut this thing down.

Oh, sure.

1:06:47.942 --> 1:06:49.577
Everything here
is made of snow,

1:06:49.644 --> 1:06:53.447
and yet somehow
you've managed to procure
nylon restraints.

1:06:57.317 --> 1:06:58.485
See that, Tuff?

1:06:58.553 --> 1:07:00.087

just fine.

1:07:13.200 --> 1:07:14.969
You fools!

1:07:15.035 --> 1:07:19.473
I gave the Destroy-A-Matic
Five Million
a failsafe kill mode.

1:07:23.912 --> 1:07:25.412
Which, in hindsight,

1:07:25.479 --> 1:07:28.415
probably wasn't the safest
feature for a child's toy.

1:07:28.482 --> 1:07:31.519
But it's sure
coming in gangbusters now!

1:07:36.423 --> 1:07:38.158
Uncle Jerry, what do we do?

1:07:38.225 --> 1:07:40.628

That's useless.

1:07:50.304 --> 1:07:52.640
You can only
turn it off manually.

[Larry] There's a power switch
on its head!

1:08:02.884 --> 1:08:04.284
We got to get to that switch.

1:08:04.351 --> 1:08:06.688
Larry, think you
and I can up there?

1:08:06.754 --> 1:08:08.856

Uncle Jerry, trust me.

1:08:12.292 --> 1:08:15.730
Larry and I can get to the top
of that robot and turn it off.

1:08:15.797 --> 1:08:16.931
But we need someone

1:08:16.998 --> 1:08:17.932
to distract the big guy

1:08:17.999 --> 1:08:19.099

Don't worry, Tuff. I got this.
