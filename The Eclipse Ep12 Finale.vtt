00:00:19.668 --> 00:00:21.831
Beliefs determine what people do.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.844
Some people even believe that their own thoughts and actions are the only ones that are right.

00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:32.028
Like me before I met you.

00:00:36.956 --> 00:00:41.059
There is no evidence of any support for the protesters, ma'am.

00:00:41.488 --> 00:00:43.689
I believe they act independently.

00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:46.554
Troublemakers.

00:00:47.311 --> 00:00:50.153
Invite the students’ parents to come see me.

00:00:50.912 --> 00:00:51.709
Yes, ma’am.

00:00:52.128 --> 00:00:54.802
What about Akk and Thuaphu?

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.616
Did you form a committee to investigate the situation?

00:00:58.001 --> 00:00:58.790
Yes.

00:00:59.556 --> 00:01:01.556
I asked Teacher Sani to take care of it.

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:03.622
The committee will all be here tomorrow.

00:01:08.325 --> 00:01:10.325
How shameful.

00:01:11.631 --> 00:01:13.342
They are not cautious at all.

00:02:44.284 --> 00:02:45.740
What the hell are you looking at?

00:02:49.572 --> 00:02:51.898
Why do I need to pair up with a nerd like you?

00:02:52.417 --> 00:02:54.000
It’s not fun at all.

00:02:57.216 --> 00:03:00.163
Next time, don’t protect me like that again.

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:03.491
I’m used to it.

00:03:06.138 --> 00:03:09.945
Whatever they say about me, I don’t care.

00:03:15.953 --> 00:03:18.117
I don’t want to see you get hurt like that again.

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:24.934
Cut!

00:03:25.754 --> 00:03:26.683
Good.

00:03:30.323 --> 00:03:32.555
How was our acting there?

00:03:33.282 --> 00:03:34.355
Did you film us?

00:03:35.524 --> 00:03:36.451
Yes.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:43.427
Let’s start again.

00:03:43.427 --> 00:03:44.819
Am I doing it well?

00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:46.588
Yes, you are.

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:49.574
How is it going, everyone?

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.996
- Hello, Teacher.
- Hello.

00:03:55.121 --> 00:03:57.284
Look here.

00:03:58.954 --> 00:04:00.545
How are you, Wasuwat?

00:04:00.545 --> 00:04:02.023
Are you getting what you want?

00:04:02.132 --> 00:04:04.184
Ah, I am.

00:04:04.514 --> 00:04:06.153
Do you want to have a look?

00:04:07.422 --> 00:04:09.297
I will watch it once it’s done.

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:11.468
Is this the last scene already?

00:04:11.713 --> 00:04:13.608
Not yet.

00:04:13.608 --> 00:04:16.369
We will be filming it on the rooftop.

00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:17.167
But…

00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:19.060
we must wait for the solar eclipse.

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.969
Ah, tomorrow afternoon?

00:04:23.093 --> 00:04:24.181
That’s right.

00:04:24.942 --> 00:04:27.158
What is it, ma’am?

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.539
The committee will arrive tomorrow morning to investigate Akk and Thuaphu.

00:04:33.056 --> 00:04:36.815
So, how will he be able to act in my short film?

00:04:44.713 --> 00:04:46.191
May we come in, please?

00:05:05.508 --> 00:05:10.610
Every chaos that happened was caused by you two.

00:05:11.478 --> 00:05:12.820
How disappointing.

00:05:14.264 --> 00:05:18.250
One is the president of the prefect club.

00:05:18.537 --> 00:05:20.487
The other is the head of the class.

00:05:20.984 --> 00:05:24.270
How could you ruin Suppalo’s reputation like that?

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:33.742
There’s also the short film, Miss principal.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.297
And you are making a short film,

00:05:39.132 --> 00:05:45.038
exposing your own sexual abnormality to the world.

00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:49.070
I don't mind if you're not embarrassed.

00:05:49.450 --> 00:06:00.000
But you’re announcing that Suppalo chose flawed people to be student leaders.

00:06:01.046 --> 00:06:02.584
May I?

00:06:05.705 --> 00:06:09.717
I don’t think the short film and students' sexual preferences

00:06:09.717 --> 00:06:12.151
are what we should discuss here.

00:06:12.267 --> 00:06:13.630
And the word ‘abnormality’ you used–

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.404
I think…

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:17.283
let’s just move on to the matter, Teacher Waree.

00:06:21.258 --> 00:06:29.394
Today's discussion is the punishment for students who fabricated the Suppalo curse situation, ma’am.

00:06:30.801 --> 00:06:32.489
This is a serious matter.

00:06:33.184 --> 00:06:38.147
What is the school's mandated punishment for this, Teacher Waree?

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:48.397
The punishment is either a one-semester suspension or expulsion, ma’am.

00:06:58.223 --> 00:07:01.310
This is the climax

00:07:01.951 --> 00:07:05.011
because the characters finally accept what they are.

00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:21.002
Kan.

00:07:21.002 --> 00:07:21.905
Yeah.

00:07:21.905 --> 00:07:23.414
Help the actors read their lines.

00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:25.671
Come on.

00:07:25.671 --> 00:07:27.423
Before the solar eclipse happens.

00:07:31.119 --> 00:07:32.397
Do you remember your dialogue?

00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:34.304
I do.

00:07:39.106 --> 00:07:40.003
Wat!

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:41.296
Look.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.171
Come on.

00:07:49.976 --> 00:07:52.522
Guys, stand by.

00:07:52.672 --> 00:07:53.477
Slate!

00:07:53.477 --> 00:07:54.953
Scene 2, Cut 1, Take 1.

00:07:56.358 --> 00:07:59.210
And…action.

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:27.192
Wat.

00:08:27.542 --> 00:08:28.944
Aren’t you gonna cut here?

00:08:30.612 --> 00:08:32.612
All these times,

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.471
I have carried all heavy issues on my shoulders.

00:08:39.532 --> 00:08:41.287
But now I don’t care.

00:08:43.148 --> 00:08:45.637
If I could freely choose to do anything,

00:08:48.179 --> 00:08:49.907
I’d choose to tell you…

00:08:53.707 --> 00:08:54.701
I…

00:09:00.258 --> 00:09:01.400
Are you alright?

00:09:19.862 --> 00:09:21.033
I can’t do this.

00:09:23.477 --> 00:09:25.640
My real life isn’t like your movie.

00:09:27.795 --> 00:09:30.556
I can’t accept it as easily as the character can.

00:09:39.506 --> 00:09:40.636
Akk.

00:09:44.105 --> 00:09:45.317
I love you.

00:09:48.606 --> 00:09:50.715
And I want you to love yourself too.

00:09:53.587 --> 00:09:54.880
Do you get it?

00:09:58.878 --> 00:10:00.769
This is normal.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.669
It’s so normal.

00:10:04.222 --> 00:10:06.983
It is our nature that is the same as everyone else's.

00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:10.186
Don’t give a shit about what they think.

00:10:11.039 --> 00:10:12.604
At least,

00:10:13.762 --> 00:10:16.414
we’re normal in each other’s eyes and that’s all.

00:10:21.139 --> 00:10:22.064
I know.

00:10:25.979 --> 00:10:27.358
But I can’t do it.

00:10:27.684 --> 00:10:29.711
I really can’t.

00:10:32.748 --> 00:10:33.661
Akk.

00:10:43.428 --> 00:10:44.640
I’m sorry.

00:11:20.732 --> 00:11:21.753
Hi, there.

00:11:25.077 --> 00:11:26.887
There, there.

00:11:29.875 --> 00:11:31.712
I ruined everything.

00:11:35.085 --> 00:11:36.460
It’s okay.

00:11:41.662 --> 00:11:43.580
I ruined Wat’s film.

00:11:45.782 --> 00:11:47.401
Everybody understands.

00:11:48.830 --> 00:11:50.721
Wat asked me to tell you that

00:11:51.279 --> 00:11:52.627
don’t worry.

00:11:53.154 --> 00:11:54.692
He will take it from there.

00:11:56.504 --> 00:11:58.667
Why am I such a troublemaker?

00:12:07.471 --> 00:12:08.900
You’re not, Akk.

00:12:27.728 --> 00:12:28.718
What is this?

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.087
The revised student punishment protocol, 2005 edition.

00:12:35.593 --> 00:12:37.029
It doesn’t change anything.

00:12:37.437 --> 00:12:43.270
As our student punishment protocol references the Revolutionary Council's proclamation in 1972.

00:12:43.839 --> 00:12:44.703
That’s true.

00:12:44.703 --> 00:12:48.987
We’ve been referencing the proclamation as well as the 2000 edition of the punishment protocol.

00:12:48.987 --> 00:12:51.739
But there is a change to the 2005 edition.

00:12:53.249 --> 00:12:54.295
What change?

00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:00.591
Suspension and expulsion are no longer permitted under the 2005 edition proclamation.

00:13:00.971 --> 00:13:07.264
What remains are warnings, probation, and point deductions.

00:13:07.264 --> 00:13:08.555
This is absurd.

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.464
That means we have no right to punish students who have committed serious violations?

00:13:14.766 --> 00:13:15.636
No.

00:13:15.853 --> 00:13:19.905
Those two students must be suspended for one semester no matter what.

00:13:19.905 --> 00:13:25.195
If we do that, the students and their parents may sue us, citing this proclamation.

00:13:25.583 --> 00:13:27.583
Our school's reputation will be ruined even more.

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.662
I understand what they did was wrong.

00:13:32.114 --> 00:13:33.394
Should we do this instead?

00:13:33.838 --> 00:13:38.525
Give them a brief suspension as punishment.

00:13:38.525 --> 00:13:42.195
This suspension will allow them to find a way to improve their behaviors.

00:13:43.589 --> 00:13:45.806
The rules have changed, Miss principal.

00:13:46.198 --> 00:13:48.407
If we want Suppalo to still stand,

00:13:49.175 --> 00:13:52.100
Suppalo must adjust.

00:14:16.821 --> 00:14:17.921
What is this now?

00:14:20.499 --> 00:14:21.989
My resignation paper.

00:14:33.235 --> 00:14:36.392
Thank you for everything.

00:15:40.864 --> 00:15:42.903
I’m sorry, Akk,

00:15:43.434 --> 00:15:44.594
for everything.

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:50.550
Thank you so much, Ayan.

00:15:58.056 --> 00:16:00.366
I think you should have them, sir.

00:16:41.523 --> 00:16:44.635
Are you sure you can handle it by yourself?

00:17:26.672 --> 00:17:30.639
I'm sorry for causing the truck to hit you.

00:17:33.956 --> 00:17:37.718
I’m sorry too for everything I did.

00:18:01.552 --> 00:18:02.466
I’ll see you later,

00:18:04.577 --> 00:18:05.335
friend.

00:18:09.471 --> 00:18:11.758
Are you staying at your dorm or what?

00:18:12.196 --> 00:18:13.118
I’m going home.

00:18:16.684 --> 00:18:17.619
Safe trip home.

00:18:17.619 --> 00:18:18.811
My dad will be here soon.

00:18:19.511 --> 00:18:20.363
See you.

00:18:41.097 --> 00:18:41.929
Are you ready?

00:18:58.242 --> 00:18:58.798
Hey.

00:18:58.798 --> 00:19:00.146
Hello.

00:19:00.146 --> 00:19:00.669
Akk.

00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:02.254
Aye, you came too?

00:19:02.866 --> 00:19:04.354
I just have nowhere else to go.

00:19:06.158 --> 00:19:07.133
Mom, let me help.

00:19:29.648 --> 00:19:32.406
Are you sure you can handle it by yourself?

00:19:52.133 --> 00:19:52.821
Akk.

00:20:08.135 --> 00:20:09.602
I got suspended from school.

00:20:16.484 --> 00:20:18.300
We know.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:21.818
The school informed us yesterday.

00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:23.969
When you’re ready,

00:20:25.854 --> 00:20:28.406
we would love to hear the story from you again.

00:20:33.543 --> 00:20:35.543
I did something so terrible.

00:20:39.458 --> 00:20:40.455
I don't even know

00:20:43.223 --> 00:20:45.162
if those people will forgive me at all.

00:21:15.043 --> 00:21:15.544
Akk,

00:21:16.528 --> 00:21:20.937
how many significant persons do you believe you have in your life?

00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.511
Come again, Dad?

00:21:24.009 --> 00:21:27.710
How many significant people do you have in your life?

00:21:32.348 --> 00:21:33.429
Dad,

00:21:35.232 --> 00:21:36.151
Mom,

00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:40.873
Kan,

00:21:41.713 --> 00:21:42.394
Wat,

00:21:43.892 --> 00:21:44.868
and…

00:21:46.809 --> 00:21:50.455
Kan, Wat, and Aye called us yesterday.

00:21:51.155 --> 00:21:52.294
Everyone was worried about you.

00:21:52.928 --> 00:21:57.121
They said when you’re ready, call them back.

00:21:57.558 --> 00:22:01.197
That means those three already forgave you.

00:22:02.521 --> 00:22:03.701
As for Mom and I,

00:22:05.575 --> 00:22:07.001
we were never mad at you.

00:22:07.455 --> 00:22:08.902
Ever since you were born,

00:22:09.112 --> 00:22:11.419
you’ve always been our pride.

00:22:16.617 --> 00:22:18.801
But I might disappoint you.

00:22:22.261 --> 00:22:23.520
There’s one more thing

00:22:27.927 --> 00:22:29.016
I’ve never told you before.

00:22:38.402 --> 00:22:39.070
I…

00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:44.430
I…

00:22:45.106 --> 00:22:49.979
Whatever it is repressed inside, say it.

00:22:49.979 --> 00:22:50.855
Say it, Son.

00:22:50.994 --> 00:22:52.625
Let Mom and Dad know it.

00:23:05.321 --> 00:23:06.542
I like men.

00:23:10.682 --> 00:23:11.985
I like men.

00:23:15.497 --> 00:23:17.702
I know you two would be so regretful.

00:23:17.702 --> 00:23:18.700
Not at all.

00:23:18.958 --> 00:23:20.548
I never regret it.

00:23:21.032 --> 00:23:23.032
I only care for you.

00:23:26.037 --> 00:23:27.422
You must have been bearing it for so long.

00:23:28.655 --> 00:23:30.455
You finally have the courage to let it out.

00:23:34.479 --> 00:23:37.525
Well done, Son.

00:23:46.474 --> 00:23:48.413
Do you regret it?

00:23:48.413 --> 00:23:49.776
No.

00:23:49.886 --> 00:23:51.189
You’re my son.

00:23:51.189 --> 00:23:52.267
Our son.

00:24:02.901 --> 00:24:03.750
Let’s eat.

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:07.443
We don’t get to gather very often.

00:24:07.443 --> 00:24:08.002
Start.

00:24:08.002 --> 00:24:08.921
Okay.

00:24:12.819 --> 00:24:14.389
Good, as always, Mom.

00:24:26.355 --> 00:24:27.453
Ma’am. Sir.

00:24:28.847 --> 00:24:29.495
Hm?

00:24:33.254 --> 00:24:39.455
If Akk and I aren’t just friends,

00:24:44.341 --> 00:24:46.218
would you hate the idea?

00:24:51.578 --> 00:24:52.266
Aye.

00:24:56.236 --> 00:24:57.744
Not friends.

00:24:58.378 --> 00:25:00.378
What are you two then?

00:25:14.990 --> 00:25:16.826
We are boyfriends.

00:25:19.518 --> 00:25:21.354
We’ve been together for a while.

00:25:26.999 --> 00:25:27.769
Is that true, Akk?

00:25:38.728 --> 00:25:39.682
It is true, Dad.

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.253
We can’t possibly

00:25:46.536 --> 00:25:48.535
hate someone our son loves.

00:25:55.098 --> 00:25:57.098
Eat more.

00:25:57.098 --> 00:25:58.611
Here, Aye.

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:02.292
Thanks for taking care of our Akk.

00:26:04.698 --> 00:26:06.800
My turn.

00:26:06.882 --> 00:26:09.590
I thank you too.

00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:11.455
- Eat more.
- Thank you.

00:26:11.825 --> 00:26:12.903
What is this?

00:26:13.525 --> 00:26:15.361
You don’t give me food.

00:26:15.361 --> 00:26:16.322
You only give it to…

00:26:16.714 --> 00:26:17.791
Their son’s boyfriend.

00:26:18.057 --> 00:26:18.980
I’m their son’s boyfriend.

00:26:20.124 --> 00:26:23.231
Alright. I’ll give you more than I gave Aye.

00:26:23.231 --> 00:26:24.410
You got two.

00:26:27.893 --> 00:26:29.171
Hug me tight.

00:26:30.093 --> 00:26:31.512
In case you have a nightmare again tonight.

00:26:40.304 --> 00:26:45.389
You did so great telling your parents the truth.

00:26:51.079 --> 00:26:52.411
I guess because I have you.

00:26:53.517 --> 00:26:54.941
So I have the courage.

00:26:55.632 --> 00:26:56.380
Thank you.

00:27:03.679 --> 00:27:05.403
Have you talked to Wat and Kan?

00:27:07.767 --> 00:27:08.514
No.

00:27:09.734 --> 00:27:11.724
I’m too afraid to confront them.

00:27:12.676 --> 00:27:14.676
I messed up their short film.

00:27:16.534 --> 00:27:17.647
Don’t think too much.

00:27:18.107 --> 00:27:19.109
It can’t be that bad.

00:27:28.698 --> 00:27:29.241
Come on.

00:27:31.083 --> 00:27:32.172
Come on what?

00:27:36.966 --> 00:27:38.035
You’re cheeky.

00:27:39.416 --> 00:27:42.925
I mean come on. Let’s go to bed.

00:27:43.402 --> 00:27:45.402
I drove all day today.

00:27:45.866 --> 00:27:46.676
I’m tired.

00:27:48.219 --> 00:27:49.133
Tired already?

00:27:49.301 --> 00:27:51.301
I thought tonight we were gonna…

00:27:51.301 --> 00:27:51.929
Gonna what?

00:27:53.655 --> 00:27:54.237
Nothing.

00:27:54.237 --> 00:27:54.775
Akk.

00:27:55.074 --> 00:27:55.839
Akk.

00:27:56.466 --> 00:27:57.377
What is it?

00:27:57.377 --> 00:27:58.696
Let’s get some rest.

00:27:59.636 --> 00:28:00.512
Akk!!

00:28:00.857 --> 00:28:01.981
Let’s sleep.

00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:02.832
I’m already asleep.

00:28:03.276 --> 00:28:04.494
Say it.

00:28:05.291 --> 00:28:06.289
No. I’m sleeping.

00:28:06.534 --> 00:28:07.814
Akk.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.975
Don’t pretend to sleep.

00:28:11.807 --> 00:28:13.945
Tell me what we were gonna do.

00:28:13.945 --> 00:28:14.491
No.

00:28:14.491 --> 00:28:15.690
Akk!

00:28:16.113 --> 00:28:17.121
Enough.Just go to sleep.

00:28:17.121 --> 00:28:17.929
Akk!

00:28:18.222 --> 00:28:19.694
Tell me what you were saying.

00:28:19.804 --> 00:28:21.367
Go to sleep. You’re being loud.

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:25.316
Okay.

00:28:27.802 --> 00:28:29.126
I will sleep.

00:28:37.457 --> 00:28:38.246
Aye.

00:28:39.098 --> 00:28:39.803
Aye.

00:28:40.550 --> 00:28:41.340
Are you sleeping?

00:28:45.046 --> 00:28:45.911
Come here.

00:28:46.535 --> 00:28:47.621
Let’s cuddle.

00:28:50.015 --> 00:28:51.090
Come on.

00:28:52.632 --> 00:28:53.385
Here.

00:28:57.462 --> 00:28:58.748
Hug me tight.

00:28:59.625 --> 00:29:01.165
In case you have a nightmare again tonight.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:13.349
Trying to mess with me?

00:29:40.729 --> 00:29:41.400
Continue.

00:29:44.577 --> 00:29:45.515
Continue what?

00:29:46.534 --> 00:29:47.820
I won’t hold back anymore.

00:30:40.612 --> 00:30:41.944
Why open the curtain?

00:30:45.343 --> 00:30:46.790
Took you long enough to wake up.

00:30:47.499 --> 00:30:48.300
Are you tired?

00:30:53.161 --> 00:30:54.387
How about we do it again and see?

00:30:54.525 --> 00:30:55.805
You’re the one tired.

00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:03.414
Aye!

00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.920
Go take a shower.

00:31:10.793 --> 00:31:11.534
Aye.

00:31:12.862 --> 00:31:16.750
I used to dream of sailing to the edge of the sea.

00:31:17.445 --> 00:31:18.197
Really?

00:31:18.358 --> 00:31:19.169
Let’s go.

00:31:20.629 --> 00:31:21.731
Akk, Aye.

00:31:29.298 --> 00:31:30.179
Guys.

00:31:30.524 --> 00:31:31.643
What brings you all here?

00:31:32.989 --> 00:31:34.989
- Hello, ma’am.
- Hello.

00:31:35.257 --> 00:31:38.270
Your home is as lovely as these guys bragged.

00:31:39.164 --> 00:31:40.239
What did you brag about?

00:31:40.354 --> 00:31:42.614
I just said your mom’s food tastes so good.

00:31:42.614 --> 00:31:43.275
True.

00:31:43.275 --> 00:31:44.475
Her son tastes so good too.

00:31:45.814 --> 00:31:47.054
Easy there.

00:31:47.672 --> 00:31:48.567
Have you guys eaten?

00:31:48.567 --> 00:31:49.494
We haven’t.

00:31:49.494 --> 00:31:50.443
Let’s go eat then.

00:31:50.443 --> 00:31:51.039
Come on.

00:31:56.836 --> 00:31:59.214
Miss, aren’t you getting in the water too?

00:31:59.494 --> 00:32:00.372
I don’t think so.

00:32:00.648 --> 00:32:02.323
I’ll just watch them from here.

00:32:03.430 --> 00:32:05.430
It’s so good to be teenagers.

00:32:09.174 --> 00:32:12.095
Kids have their own problems to deal with.

00:32:12.503 --> 00:32:14.342
They are not as carefree as we think.

00:32:18.834 --> 00:32:20.834
Yes, there. There’s a fish around that rock.

00:32:23.781 --> 00:32:25.252
What’s the surprise?

00:32:25.252 --> 00:32:26.985
Calm down, man.

00:32:27.391 --> 00:32:28.862
It’s nothing. Don’t be scared.

00:32:31.386 --> 00:32:33.202
Aye, unblindfold him.

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:43.409
What is this?

00:32:43.866 --> 00:32:44.961
My film is done.

00:32:45.559 --> 00:32:46.395
Let’s watch it.

00:32:48.451 --> 00:32:49.714
Make it quick, Wat.

00:32:50.399 --> 00:32:52.399
But I ruined that scene.

00:32:53.301 --> 00:32:54.659
Just watch it first.

00:33:02.493 --> 00:33:03.273
‘Kad?’

00:33:05.187 --> 00:33:07.440
Another word for ‘solar eclipse.’

00:33:14.285 --> 00:33:16.193
Stop the Suppalo curse.

00:33:16.193 --> 00:33:18.327
Find the one responsible.

00:33:18.508 --> 00:33:20.174
Who sent you to mess with this school?

00:33:20.449 --> 00:33:21.367
Your old school?

00:33:22.263 --> 00:33:26.151
School should be a place where we can express our opinions.

00:33:27.378 --> 00:33:28.895
The curse again?

00:33:31.991 --> 00:33:34.659
Next time, don’t protect me like that again.

00:33:36.257 --> 00:33:37.382
I’m used to it.

00:33:43.883 --> 00:33:44.642
What is it?

00:33:45.724 --> 00:33:47.241
I’m afraid you’d disappear again.

00:34:00.083 --> 00:34:02.083
My real life isn’t like your movie.

00:34:02.849 --> 00:34:05.517
I can’t accept it as easily as the character can.

00:34:06.622 --> 00:34:08.534
We’re normal in each other’s eyes and that’s all.

00:34:16.253 --> 00:34:17.125
Wow!
[Directed by Wasuwat Kongkiat]

00:34:27.081 --> 00:34:27.974
Wat.

00:34:28.889 --> 00:34:30.614
Didn’t you delete that scene?

00:34:32.409 --> 00:34:33.695
You were so sincere.

00:34:35.575 --> 00:34:36.614
How could I delete it?

00:34:38.908 --> 00:34:40.724
You did a great job, Wat.

00:34:46.867 --> 00:34:48.130
Thank you, Teacher,

00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:50.478
for keeping me from getting lost.

00:34:57.614 --> 00:34:59.614
Cheers!

00:35:01.008 --> 00:35:01.903
Get closer.

00:35:05.081 --> 00:35:06.206
I’ll go grill these.

00:35:06.206 --> 00:35:07.351
Just a moment.

00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.247
Are you drunk?

00:35:13.324 --> 00:35:14.296
Come on.

00:35:18.643 --> 00:35:19.653
What is it?

00:35:22.782 --> 00:35:25.174
Since we are all here tonight,

00:35:26.071 --> 00:35:29.268
I, Mr. Kanlong, along with Mr. Thuaphu,

00:35:29.576 --> 00:35:30.974
have an announcement to make.

00:35:31.381 --> 00:35:32.253
What announcement?

00:35:36.618 --> 00:35:39.454
We, from now on, will come out in the open.

00:35:44.312 --> 00:35:46.534
Aren’t you open enough as you are now?

00:35:48.163 --> 00:35:51.821
Coming out doesn’t require just our courage.

00:35:52.491 --> 00:35:57.691
We need an understanding and supporting community and family as well.

00:35:58.649 --> 00:36:02.145
We are lucky you guys understand us.

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:05.310
We thank you too, Teacher Sani.

00:36:08.342 --> 00:36:10.250
Since this is a special occasion,

00:36:10.534 --> 00:36:13.570
we prepared a special show for you all.

Of course, I am.

00:36:49.694 --> 00:36:54.940
I have friends and a teacher who always support me.

00:36:55.295 --> 00:36:56.157
I’m not afraid.

00:36:57.009 --> 00:36:58.009
What about me?

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.560
Am I not your supporter?

00:37:03.261 --> 00:37:05.689
Yeah, I know.

00:37:06.726 --> 00:37:07.770
Without you,

00:37:11.246 --> 00:37:13.399

They all went to bed.

00:37:46.277 --> 00:37:47.540
It’s just us here.

00:37:49.236 --> 00:37:50.430
And why are you here?

00:37:50.967 --> 00:37:52.507
I can’t get up.

00:37:52.821 --> 00:37:54.294
You’re sleeping on my legs.

00:38:02.358 --> 00:38:03.736
That’s your reason?

00:38:15.467 --> 00:38:16.730
Was that enough to be my reason?

00:38:19.124 --> 00:38:19.839
No.

00:39:02.804 --> 00:39:03.889
Hello.

00:39:18.792 --> 00:39:20.594
- Hello, Teacher.

Thua.

00:39:54.605 --> 00:39:56.481
Take our leaflets too.

00:39:56.481 --> 00:39:59.777
Come and join us, everyone.

00:40:03.483 --> 00:40:04.258

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.705
I’m returning them to you.

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:08.533
But Uncle Di–

00:40:08.533 --> 00:40:10.136
Di would want his nephew to have them more.

00:40:11.150 --> 00:40:12.146
Don’t worry.

00:40:12.443 --> 00:40:15.227
Di will always stay in my heart.

00:40:21.799 --> 00:40:23.799
I met Mes yesterday.

00:40:24.426 --> 00:40:25.932
How is he doing?

00:40:26.339 --> 00:40:28.907
He’s a uni student now. Must be so cool.

00:40:31.261 --> 00:40:32.841
He’s dealing with his depressive disorder.

00:40:33.165 --> 00:40:34.621
Taking a one-year break from uni.

00:40:37.454 --> 00:40:41.703
His dad said he couldn’t fit into the new society.

00:40:42.615 --> 00:40:46.197
It’s probably because our school hurt him so much.

00:40:52.104 --> 00:40:54.376
[Student Prefects]

00:40:54.376 --> 00:40:55.872
Every battle,

00:40:56.170 --> 00:40:57.824
even a small one
[School is worthwhile when its students recognize their own worth.]

00:40:58.433 --> 00:41:00.977
leads to a change eventually.

00:41:01.391 --> 00:41:05.022
Today, Suppalo's rules, which had been maintained for over a century,

00:41:05.668 --> 00:41:07.668
have undergone some changes
[Suppalo’s Rules]

00:41:07.818 --> 00:41:10.708
in order to fit into the modern age.

00:41:12.337 --> 00:41:16.117
From this moment on, I quit being a student prefect

00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:18.359
and take this opportunity to repent myself.

00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:20.670
According to our agreement,

00:41:21.397 --> 00:41:28.464
the one who qualifies to be the new student prefect is

00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:31.040
Mr. Namo Thamrongtham.

00:41:36.539 --> 00:41:37.614
Congratulations.

00:41:37.614 --> 00:41:38.418
Thank you

00:41:43.869 --> 00:41:46.660
As for the new club president,

00:41:46.868 --> 00:41:50.845
which, for the first time ever, was selected by our votes,

00:41:51.367 --> 00:41:55.048
the result is in my hands now.

00:41:56.448 --> 00:42:00.499
Congratulations to the new prefect club president,

00:42:02.156 --> 00:42:04.156
Mr. Wasuwat Kongkiat.

00:42:16.987 --> 00:42:18.108
Congratulations.

00:42:18.987 --> 00:42:19.866
Thank you.

00:42:41.518 --> 00:42:43.123
Shit. What’s the answer?

00:42:43.856 --> 00:42:44.892
So freaking tough.

00:42:47.256 --> 00:42:48.093
Kanlong.

00:42:48.983 --> 00:42:49.775
Yes, ma’am.

00:43:21.853 --> 00:43:26.424
I read historical anecdotes on the website you mentioned before.

00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:28.975
There are many interesting topics there.

00:43:30.365 --> 00:43:35.801
If this historian writes more articles, share with me the link.

00:43:38.841 --> 00:43:39.708
Yes, ma’am.

00:43:46.031 --> 00:43:48.031
You have 20 minutes left.

00:43:50.577 --> 00:43:52.182
Took you so long to finish the exam.

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:53.911
You couldn’t do it, could you?

00:43:54.084 --> 00:43:55.652
I was reviewing my answers.

00:43:55.852 --> 00:43:57.086
It’s called being careful.

00:43:57.841 --> 00:43:59.421
I beat you for sure this time.

00:43:59.807 --> 00:44:00.917
No way.

00:44:00.917 --> 00:44:02.141
Of course, I beat you.

00:44:02.387 --> 00:44:03.794
I went full-on this time.

00:44:04.229 --> 00:44:07.020
You know when I get serious, I always win…

00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:08.247
Bla bla bla.

00:44:08.476 --> 00:44:09.486
What a bragger.

00:44:09.881 --> 00:44:10.772
Are you done here?

00:44:12.304 --> 00:44:13.090
I am.

00:44:19.144 --> 00:44:19.958
Let’s go.

00:44:40.647 --> 00:44:42.647
The exam is over!

00:44:42.647 --> 00:44:44.814
Welcome, school break!

00:44:58.241 --> 00:45:00.043
Time to let your uncle go.

00:45:13.082 --> 00:45:14.588
Goodbye, Uncle.

00:45:16.738 --> 00:45:20.196
Goodbye, Teacher Dika.

00:46:03.787 --> 00:46:04.601
Are you ready?

00:46:14.376 --> 00:46:18.057
Last time, you were the only one that pinned it for me. It’s not fair.

00:46:19.219 --> 00:46:20.428
This time, we do it for each other.

00:46:33.044 --> 00:46:33.981
I like it.

00:46:36.210 --> 00:46:37.839
It’s like we’re exchanging wedding rings.

00:46:49.723 --> 00:46:50.932
Hug me.

00:46:59.710 --> 00:47:01.339
Your body is so warm, Big Foot.

00:47:10.359 --> 00:47:11.642
I want to kiss you.

00:47:14.339 --> 00:47:15.503
Can I kiss you?

00:47:17.110 --> 00:47:17.946
Of course.

00:47:19.492 --> 00:47:20.800
I want to kiss you too.

00:47:37.751 --> 00:47:38.861
I love you.

00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.383
Do you know

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:33.986
how much I like it when the sky is clear like this?

00:48:38.471 --> 00:48:39.310
I do.

00:48:40.323 --> 00:48:41.484
I like it too.

00:48:42.574 --> 00:48:43.846
The sky?

00:48:45.008 --> 00:48:45.736
Um.

00:48:50.347 --> 00:48:55.041
But I like it more when you’re next to me, Akk.

00:49:30.562 --> 00:49:37.614
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

00:49:39.322 --> 00:49:40.951
Is there any news on that new kid?

00:49:42.923 --> 00:49:45.220
I think he’s come to mess with our school.

00:49:46.169 --> 00:49:47.614
Ever since he joined,

00:49:47.614 --> 00:49:48.790
The World Remembrance…

00:49:56.405 --> 00:49:57.787
- Should I push you again?
- Yes.

00:50:05.738 --> 00:50:07.095
- That's it?
- Yes.

00:50:10.464 --> 00:50:11.648
I'm sorry, my friend.

00:50:11.648 --> 00:50:12.808
Why are you apologizing?

00:50:13.950 --> 00:50:14.961
Sorry.

00:50:14.961 --> 00:50:16.025
That was the wrong throwing.

00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:20.431
Napkins, please.

00:50:21.042 --> 00:50:21.750
No.

00:50:21.750 --> 00:50:23.833
I will stay here in front of the student welfare department.

00:50:23.833 --> 00:50:24.727
But it’s nice and cold there.

00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.920
It’s good. I like it.

00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:31.914
You like personality?

00:50:31.914 --> 00:50:32.981
I like him. As if!

00:50:33.177 --> 00:50:34.018
What?

00:50:34.018 --> 00:50:34.782
What a bad joke!

00:50:35.227 --> 00:50:36.014
Kan.

00:50:38.026 --> 00:50:39.284
This is you being fit already?

00:50:41.863 --> 00:50:43.171
Guys.

00:50:47.309 --> 00:50:49.754
Is everything going well for the school foundation day?

00:50:49.754 --> 00:50:50.794
Well…

00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:55.641
You’ll be working with Teacher Dika.

00:50:56.598 --> 00:50:58.598
Teacher Dika, advise him.

00:50:58.845 --> 00:51:00.252
I shouldn’t do the hand gesture?

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:03.317
I’m stretching my shoulders.

00:51:03.317 --> 00:51:04.218
I’m not tense.

00:51:06.665 --> 00:51:08.011
Sorry. Did I hurt you?

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:13.863
Sorry.

00:51:14.367 --> 00:51:15.209
Is it good?

00:51:16.198 --> 00:51:16.961
No.

00:51:17.378 --> 00:51:18.735
Bro, he said it wasn’t good.

00:51:18.735 --> 00:51:20.456
I didn’t. I was gonna say, “Nosy!”

00:51:20.874 --> 00:51:29.523
But you’re announcing that Suppalo chose unsuitable people to be student leaders.

00:51:29.523 --> 00:51:30.977
Flawed was the word.

00:51:30.977 --> 00:51:32.025
Yes, flawed.

00:51:34.033 --> 00:51:36.305
I should’ve said, “Mr. President” as well. Sorry.

00:51:36.305 --> 00:51:38.757
Yes, so they know who I am.

00:51:38.757 --> 00:51:39.976
- Mr. President.
- Give me the title.

00:51:41.014 --> 00:51:43.014
Welcome to…what is it? I forgot.

00:51:47.051 --> 00:51:48.072
What is it?

00:51:48.492 --> 00:51:49.595
Cut!
