00:00:10,583 --> 00:00:12,750
-[cell phone chimes]
-Hello. My name is Bruno.

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,666
And I'm giving this another chance.
[chuckles]

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:16,541
Hope is the last to die, right?

6
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,041
[chuckles awkwardly]

7
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:23,958
I know that confessing this
on this app isn't the best idea,

8
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,625
but I'm after that feeling.

9
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:30,750
I… I guess I worry that
I've forgotten how it feels to love.

10
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:35,875
[Bruno] <i>I'm probably looking for it</i>
<i>in the wrong places,</i>

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:38,333
<i>but it doesn't hurt to keep trying.</i>

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,583
Where you going?

13
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:43,958
-[Ibra] Have you seen my phone?
-No.

14
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,333
[grunts] But let's look for it later.

15
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,916
-It's gotta be getting late.
-No.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,500
I'm gonna get chewed out.

17
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,416
-Oh good. Then you'll get fired.
-[Ibra chuckles]

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,541
-Then you can stay here in bed all day.
-Oh yeah?

19
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:56,541
-Are you gonna pay my rent?
-[Álex laughing]

20
00:00:56,625 --> 00:00:58,041
Are you gonna pay my rent or what?

21
00:00:58,125 --> 00:00:59,208
[Álex laughs] Stop.

22
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,000
Shit, I have to go.

23
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:06,083
-Well, I should really get going.
-[Álex] Okay.

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,458
[sighs]

25
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,375
You free later?

26
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,958
-You wanna grab a drink when you're off?
-Today?

27
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,916
Yeah, I have some time before work.

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,208
Wow. Still got a little milk
in the pantry?

29
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,208
Uh, no. My milk is just fine
where it's at.

30
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,916
I wanted to see
if you wanted to do anything else.

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,875
Anything else?

32
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,666
I don't know. We could watch a film.

33
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:39,958
I don't know. I'm not really into movies.

34
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:44,083
-You like cinema?
-I love it.

35
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:46,625
It could be something else, like…

36
00:01:47,125 --> 00:01:50,083
I don't know. We could play a video game,
or we could skate.

37
00:01:50,166 --> 00:01:53,958
I mean, we could do more than fuck.
I'd like to get to know you a little.

38
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:57,208
We've seen each other the last few days
but I don't even know

39
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,041
what your last name is.

40
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:00,750
Ndiongue.

41
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,208
Right, uh…

42
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:04,291
And your favorite food?

43
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,416
[blows raspberry]
Uh, Spanish omelet, no onions.

44
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,208
No onions!?

45
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,250
How about… Well, I dunno…

46
00:02:10,333 --> 00:02:12,500
What group of…
What kind of music do you like?

47
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,666
Álex, I love fucking you. Believe me.

48
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,333
But I don't need to know all that
to keep doing it.

49
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:18,666
Yeah.

50
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:20,541
But I need it.

51
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:25,041
So we want different things then.

52
00:02:26,375 --> 00:02:28,458
[Ibra] Sorry. Hey.

53
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:30,958
But we're cool, right?

54
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:33,750
We're cool, yeah.

55
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,166
I'm glad.

56
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:39,208
And, you know,
if you ever wanna empty the pantry…

57
00:02:41,208 --> 00:02:42,166
you have my number.

58
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:44,791
-[lively music plays]
-Yeah.

59
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,291
[cell phone chimes]

60
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:54,250
[sighs]

61
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,125
We're doing the Tió on the 25th
instead of Christmas Eve.

62
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,041
Okay…

63
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:02,208
My parents are going away for St. Stephen,
so we're celebrating the 26th on the 24th…

64
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,500
-No, no, no.
-Yes, yes, yes.

65
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,375
Christmas with your in-laws? Albert.

66
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,583
[sighs] I'm sorry, Bruno.
Núria organized it.

67
00:03:07,666 --> 00:03:10,041
And, with how things are,
it's best I do what she says.

68
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:11,750
That bad, huh?

69
00:03:11,833 --> 00:03:13,666
Hello. Merry Christmas.

70
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:16,791
Well, or not. You never know
when to start saying it, do you?

71
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,208
-If you wait till Christmas Eve…
-Mm-hmm. And, uh--

72
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:20,791
-It's like "Happy New Year."
-Mm-hmm.

73
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:22,416
You never know when to quit.

74
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,833
There are people
who say it all January. Yeah.

75
00:03:24,916 --> 00:03:26,958
-Yeah. Merry Christmas to you too, Ramón.
-Thanks.

76
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,416
Wait, Bruno. You put your name in?

77
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,333
-We're picking today.
-No, no. Put mine in.

78
00:03:30,416 --> 00:03:32,166
-Would you do it for me, Ramón?
-Yeah, sure.

79
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:33,375
Appreciate it. Okay.

80
00:03:43,625 --> 00:03:44,583
[Lis clears throat]

81
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:46,958
What a cunning fox you are.

82
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:48,291
[chuckles] Shh.

83
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:53,208
-[cell phone chimes]
-Hello, my name is Ibra. 25 years old.

84
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,791
Height, 5'10". Weight, 80 kilos.

85
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,458
Versatile, more of a top.

86
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,625
I live in Barcelona. I live alone.

87
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:01,708
A nice guy, according to my friends.

88
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:06,208
I'm into dancing, the gym,
the usual. [chuckles]

89
00:04:06,291 --> 00:04:09,375
I'm looking for, I mean, just some fun.

90
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,583
Whatever we find, but no drama.

91
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:15,375
Surprise me in your message.
I'll be nice. [chuckles]

92
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,833
But brutally honest.

93
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,875
Uh, I need a photo of your face though.

94
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,166
[Rosa] So you two
won't see each other again?

95
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,333
[sighs] I don't think so.

96
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:25,125
Well, I don't understand.
He was head over heels for you.

97
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:28,666
He used to stop by the stall complaining
that you weren't paying attention to him.

98
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,208
Should we set up the Nativity or not?

99
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:31,916
Don't you worry.
I'll have a word with him.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,166
-Mom, that's not necessary.
-I really don't mind.

101
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,166
It's a pity. You'd be great together.

102
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,791
Mom, thanks, but, no. Leave it alone.

103
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:40,208
-Careful. They were your great-grandpa's.
-Mm-hmm.

104
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:43,125
The problem… is you're too handsome.

105
00:04:43,208 --> 00:04:45,250
[Rosa] Well! Since when is that a problem?

106
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,333
Everyone thinks
being handsome is a blessing.

107
00:04:47,416 --> 00:04:50,041
-But it's actually the opposite.
-[sighs]

108
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,083
They'll never love you for who you are.

109
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:56,041
If you'd been born ugly, I swear that
you'd be married with children by now.

110
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,041
-[scoffs]
-Don't listen to her.

111
00:04:58,125 --> 00:05:01,291
If the Ibra thing didn't work out,
another guy will come along.

112
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:03,250
Hey! How about Pepita's son?

113
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,125
You mean from the drugstore?

114
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,583
He has blue hair. He can't be straight.

115
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:10,625
[woman] Wait, an open relationship?

116
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:11,541
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

117
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,000
-Well, I don't believe you.
-[Patri] Yeah.

118
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:16,208
It's not just about sex though.

119
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:19,375
It's about us redefining
the terms of our relationship.

120
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,625
To feel more comfortable and freer…

121
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,833
[chuckles] What are you saying? You're
gonna start fucking without each other?

122
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:27,041
[both] No! No! No!

123
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,583
-[Vero] We'll do everything together.
-Everything. That's right.

124
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:31,458
We want to see
how we feel about another girl,

125
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,916
and we'll see how it's going.

126
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,083
Yeah, but that's not being open.
That's a traditional threesome.

127
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,083
-What a change.
-Well, it'd be new for me.

128
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,083
You've never had one?

129
00:05:40,166 --> 00:05:42,583
It's hard enough for me
to find one girl I'm into. [chuckles]

130
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:43,666
Imagine finding two.

131
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,750
[all chuckle]

132
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:47,666
But why are you doing it?
You're not happy together?

133
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,791
-[Vero] Yes, we're happy.
-[Patri] No, we're good.

134
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:52,708
We're fucking great, yes.
But… there could be more.

135
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:56,166
I think it's great, 'cause we all need
to deconstruct ourselves.

136
00:05:56,250 --> 00:05:58,375
And leave behind
the heteropatriarchal dynamics

137
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:01,000
that dictate how we conceive
our sex-affective relationships.

138
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,916
[chuckles] All right, Flor, honey.

139
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,041
They just want to fuck other girls.
That's all.

140
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:09,000
You don't need to layer it
with queer theory, okay? [chuckles]

141
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,625
No, I couldn't do it. It'd be a hard pass.

142
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:13,041
And, besides,

143
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:15,833
since I started seeing Natalia,
no one else makes me horny.

144
00:06:15,916 --> 00:06:18,541
-Yeah. Not even she does now. Ooh!
-Cut it out.

145
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,541
[all chuckle]

146
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:20,833
[Vero chuckles] Ohh!

147
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:23,500
So… did you guys already start?

148
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,125
-So far we've created a profile on an app.
-Mm-hmm.

149
00:06:26,208 --> 00:06:28,958
-[cell phone chimes]
-Hello. We are Vero and Patricia.

150
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,833
Mm-hmm. We've been together
for seven years.

151
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,666
She runs her own business,
and I work at a flower store.

152
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,541
And we're doing great…

153
00:06:36,625 --> 00:06:38,125
-Yeah, we're great.
-Yeah, great.

154
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:39,041
[Patri] Mm-hmm.

155
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,500
But we're also interested
in exploring new things.

156
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,416
[Patri] Mm-hmm.

157
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,833
We're looking for, uh,

158
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,041
what exactly? [chuckles]

159
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,291
-We're looking for a girl.
-A girl, right. A girl.

160
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,250
Yeah, that's right.

161
00:06:50,333 --> 00:06:51,500
Yes, and, uh…

162
00:06:52,541 --> 00:06:54,916
Well, we don't have a type, really.

163
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:55,833
-Mm-mm.
-No.

164
00:06:55,916 --> 00:07:01,208
So we're fine with pretty much
any color, size, or flavor. [chuckles]

165
00:07:01,291 --> 00:07:04,041
Yeah, the important thing is that
the three of us connect

166
00:07:04,125 --> 00:07:06,958
in a sincere, friendly way,
and that's all.

167
00:07:07,041 --> 00:07:08,541
-Yeah.
-We'll see what happens.

168
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:12,333
[Ramón] It's not working
'cause you need to correct this height.

169
00:07:12,416 --> 00:07:14,958
-Mm-hmm. We'd better adjust measurements.
-Here. Right there.

170
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,125
-I already took one.
-Really? When, though?

171
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:22,625
Five minutes ago.
Forgot already? [chuckles]

172
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:25,958
Hmm.

173
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:29,375
[whistles a tune]

174
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,458
[breathing rhythmically]

175
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,166
Bruno, you're up.

176
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,750
The maximum price is 30 euros,

177
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,791
and you can only swap presents
with somebody once.

178
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,416
[whistles] Bruno, your turn.

179
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,875
Hmm?

180
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:42,625
-What are you doing?
-Nothing. Huh?

181
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,416
-What are you looking at?
-No, it's nothing.

182
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,500
-No… No, I--
-Let me see.

183
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,875
THE BAR BERO FAMILY
ÁLEX

184
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:49,875
Are you serious?

185
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:52,958
What? It's decoration, okay?
A little eye candy.

186
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,291
Bruno. If you like him that much,
then text him.

187
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:03,250
I already did.

188
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,583
The day after I sent him a smiley.

189
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:07,833
-A smiley?
-Mm-hmm.

190
00:08:07,916 --> 00:08:09,166
Dude, what are you, 11, though?

191
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,750
No, but to him, it's not just a smiley.

192
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,583
It has significance. It's almost…

193
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,416
-Look, forget it.
-Didn't he respond?

194
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,625
Should I send another?

195
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,958
Yeah, of course.
And then crawl through the mud too.

196
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,583
He could be a slow texter.

197
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:24,750
Don't do that.

198
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,208
Hey. Take a chance on Ramón.

199
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,166
Come on.

200
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,916
He's been sad lately. I don't know…

201
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:34,833
[Albert] He's been drawing
all his plans crooked.

202
00:08:42,541 --> 00:08:43,458
Let me pick another.

203
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,208
-Please? Let me change it.
-No. Sorry.

204
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,291
No, no, no. Albert, don't fuck with me.

205
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,250
-[cell phone chimes]
-What am I looking for?

206
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,458
[chuckles] I hate this question.
It's what everyone always asks.

207
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:55,333
Well…

208
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,666
I guess I'm looking for
a reason to get off this app.

209
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,791
Um…

210
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,000
Aside from that, I really am fortunate.

211
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,916
I love what I do.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,208
I'm an architect.

213
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,583
Uh, I like swimming, uh, a lot.

214
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,583
And K-pop.

215
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,291
Uh, Eurovision…

216
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,500
[chuckles] …manga, anime.

217
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:14,625
And I'm a gamer.

218
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,458
Video or role playing or…

219
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,708
whatever game you like.

220
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,666
[chuckles awkwardly]

221
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,958
And… done.

222
00:09:25,041 --> 00:09:27,250
-The most important piece is still left.
-Ah!

223
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,166
[Dolo] Really.

224
00:09:28,875 --> 00:09:30,875
I'll never understand
why this country feels

225
00:09:30,958 --> 00:09:34,500
we need to have a guy doing his business
next to the Holy Family.

226
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,375
To remind us
that sometimes life is shitty.

227
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,625
[chuckles]

228
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,625
Oh, by the way, there'll be four of us
on Christmas Day this year.

229
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,666
-I've invited Ramiro.
-[Dolo] Will he still be here?

230
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,833
He says the repairs on his boat
are taking longer,

231
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,875
and I felt bad
that he was spending Christmas alone.

232
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:51,958
I guess you've got this.

233
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:54,791
-What is it?
-[Dolo] Your mother.

234
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,583
-She's getting her hopes up with that man.
-That's not what this is!

235
00:09:57,666 --> 00:10:00,250
Of course it is. You've seen each other
every day since he got here.

236
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,541
But you kept all this from us?!

237
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,166
That's cause there's nothing to explain.

238
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:06,708
We're just two old friends
catching up now after all these years.

239
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,166
-And nothing more.
-Rosita, I know you too well.

240
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,625
[Rosa] Nothing's happening.

241
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,375
Well… to be honest, though,

242
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:18,250
if the circumstances were different,
maybe I would consider it.

243
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,375
-You see?
-But it's not possible.

244
00:10:20,875 --> 00:10:23,916
Because Ramiro's leaving in a few days,
and I probably won't ever see him again.

245
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,916
Well, but look. Do you like him or not?

246
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:30,708
You know what we end up
talking about the most? Your father.

247
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,583
Maybe that's why I like
seeing him every day.

248
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,708
That… and plus he's handsome.

249
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,375
-What? Show me a photo.
-Hey!

250
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,000
-No.
-Well, come on. Show me.

251
00:10:39,083 --> 00:10:40,583
-Let me see his photo.
-Well, all right.

252
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,000
Come on.

253
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:44,125
-Just don't expect Sean Connery, huh?
-Yeah, right…

254
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:47,125
Time hasn't been kind to him,
the poor guy.

255
00:10:49,875 --> 00:10:51,708
Wait. I know this guy, though.

256
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,333
[soft music plays on speakers]

257
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:05,916
Good afternoon.

258
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,125
Well. Hey. It's good
to see you back again.

259
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,666
Ah! You're… You're the transvestite.

260
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,541
[exclaims] Finally!
A guy who calls a spade a spade.

261
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,583
That's right "the transvestite."

262
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:22,333
These kids all call themselves
"drag queens" now, as if they invented it.

263
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:24,375
I was doing this years before them.
[chuckles]

264
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,166
-Is Àlex here?
-Hm? No. He's off today.

265
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,000
-What'll you have?
-Uh, nothing, thanks.

266
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:31,916
-I'll be back tomorrow.
-No, no. Ch-ch-ch. Hey.

267
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,291
Don't say, "I'll be back."

268
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:36,000
What are you, the Terminator?
[deep voice] "I'll be back."

269
00:11:36,083 --> 00:11:39,000
No, stay and have a beer. It's on me. Hmm?

270
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:42,250
I've had enough of chatting
with millennials today.

271
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:43,958
I'm sorry.

272
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,000
-[cell phone chimes]
-Hi, I'm Javier.

273
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:50,916
And I've been on this application
for so long that I might just move in.

274
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:53,791
Honestly, I don't know why I'm still here.

275
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:56,875
It's an addiction,
almost like Candy Crush.

276
00:11:56,958 --> 00:11:59,041
Or it's the fear of missing out.

277
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:03,833
I usually just get told
that I'm fat, ugly, old. [chuckles]

278
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,291
Guys can be very cruel.

279
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:07,625
But I still check this every day.

280
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,458
To see if I've made it to the next level.

281
00:12:11,208 --> 00:12:12,375
If I've gotten a date.

282
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,666
Or a nice response, maybe.

283
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,083
It's not a lot to ask. Is it?

284
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,916
[Javi] And then there's the discreet ones.

285
00:12:21,416 --> 00:12:22,416
Those are the worst.

286
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:25,500
Because they're queer,
but they all hate that they are.

287
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,208
The ones still in the closet?

288
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,833
Look how fast you learn. [chuckles]

289
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,583
Well, I guess they could be in the closet,
or maybe they're not.

290
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,583
But they always look like
they're very serious.

291
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,916
They're very macho.
They have a frown on their face.

292
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,041
They're so angry looking, like,

293
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:42,958
"I lead a straight life, and Pride is like
a circus that doesn't represent me."

294
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:44,750
-[scoffs] Fuck off, you pussy.
-[chuckles]

295
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,625
Because then at 5:00 in the morning
you're all by the toilet in the disco

296
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,333
swallowing more swords
than a circus performer.

297
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,708
-[chuckles]
-I'm sorry, honey. I'm embarrassing you.

298
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:55,541
No, no, no, no! It's just that, well,

299
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,791
on the boat, we don't really
discuss these topics.

300
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:01,625
Oh. Well, you had to have
seen things there, huh?

301
00:13:01,708 --> 00:13:04,875
Surrounded by sailors,
the bow and on the stern,

302
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:08,291
on the high seas,
unable to go out for months. [chuckles]

303
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:09,458
[melancholy music plays]

304
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,541
[horn blows]

305
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:15,041
[breathes deeply]

306
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,958
[Javi] <i>You must have had</i>
<i>a very lonely life, didn't you?</i>

307
00:13:18,791 --> 00:13:19,625
I chose it.

308
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,541
And may I ask you why?

309
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,375
Because the one I really wanted…
was impossible.

310

Hmm.

311

Well, it had to have been worth it, huh?

312
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:35,000
You've traveled halfway around the world,
traveled wherever you wanted.

313
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,250
And I'll tell you something,
better off alone than in bad company.

314
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,291
Right?

315

<i>when you get home,</i>

317
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:47,166
<i>the one waiting for you is yourself.</i>

<i>I mean, they're the best. Aren't they?</i>

320
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,375
<i>And they never stop loving you,</i>
<i>no matter what.</i>

321
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:56,541
<i>And, in the end, you realize</i>

322
00:13:57,291 --> 00:14:00,916
<i>that the person you have to be</i>
<i>at peace with is yourself.</i>

323
00:14:01,708 --> 00:14:04,375
<i>Because, in the end,</i>
<i>most of the decisions…</i>

324
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,958
<i>Well, most of the bad decisions we make,</i>

325
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:10,916
<i>are almost always</i>
<i>because we don't want to feel alone.</i>

00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:56,083
So that guy came to see you at the bar
because he knew you were Rosa's son?

334
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,625
Well, maybe it was a coincidence,

335
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,791
'cause the guy didn't even know
it was a gay bar.

But it's still strange.

Yeah, I don't know. Let's see what I…

Oh. Ooh, this one isn't bad.

I am very open.

I like an orgy, but only as an idea.

Because, in reality,
it's like a buffet bar.

You end up stuffed,

347

all that much.

I don't think he can help you now.

614
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:08,583
It'd be better to check
after the holidays.

615
00:29:08,666 --> 00:29:09,500
Yeah.

616
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:11,708
That would be better.

617
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:14,625
Yes.

618
00:29:15,916 --> 00:29:17,541
Who should I say came in?

619
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:20,375
"You can always tell what kind of a person
a man really thinks you are

620
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:21,875
by the earrings he gives you."

621
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,000
[Bruno] <i>Breakfast at Tiffany's,</i>
Blake Edwards.

622
00:29:24,083 --> 00:29:25,125
-Very good.
-Mmm.

623
00:29:25,666 --> 00:29:28,375
"When you realize you wanna spend
the rest of your life with somebody…"

624
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:29,291
Oh…

625
00:29:29,375 --> 00:29:31,666
"…you want the rest of your life
to start soon as possible."

626
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,750
Nora Ephron, <i>When Harry met Sally.</i>

627
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,458
"Draw me like one of your French girls."

628
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:39,333
Well, that's <i>Titanic, </i>but it's technically
not a romantic comedy.

629
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:41,666
-That one was easy.
-But did you know… This is really cool.

630
00:29:41,750 --> 00:29:44,166
Did you know that
Leonardo DiCaprio didn't know

631
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:46,166
that Kate Winslet was gonna get naked?

632
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,541
-Okay.
-And no one warned him.

633
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:48,875
-So he flubbed the lines.
-No!

634
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:51,083
But James Cameron liked it so much
that he kept it.

635
00:29:51,166 --> 00:29:52,208
-Wait, really? No.
-He did.

636
00:29:52,291 --> 00:29:54,083
You think there was room for both
on that door?

637
00:29:54,166 --> 00:29:56,041
-Well, obviously. Don't you?
-Yes.

638
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:58,291
Look, Rose, Jack died there
because of you.

639
00:29:58,375 --> 00:29:59,583
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-Another.

640
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:01,000
Okay, um…

641
00:30:02,916 --> 00:30:03,750
All right.

642
00:30:04,791 --> 00:30:07,458
"That day, she was amazed… to discover

643
00:30:07,541 --> 00:30:09,125
that when he was saying, 'As you wish,'

644
00:30:09,208 --> 00:30:10,958
what he meant was, 'I love you.'"

645
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:13,416
<i>The Princess Bride,</i> Rob Reiner.

646
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,458
You know every one.

647
00:30:14,541 --> 00:30:16,625
You're just picking great movies.
[chuckles]

648
00:30:16,708 --> 00:30:19,083
Some day, if you want,
we can watch one together.

649
00:30:19,666 --> 00:30:21,291
I don't mean one of these, I mean,

650
00:30:21,375 --> 00:30:23,583
go to the theater
and see a new one or… Yeah.

651
00:30:23,666 --> 00:30:25,791
-Yeah.
-There are a lot of new ones coming out.

652
00:30:25,875 --> 00:30:27,125
Mm-hmm. Uh…

653
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:31,166
Sure. Well, maybe it'd be better
to wait until after the holidays, right?

654
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,291
'Cause of the holiday rush. [chuckles]

655
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,458
As you wish.

656
00:30:36,875 --> 00:30:38,875
[electronic dance music plays]

657
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:50,458
Uh, Ramón…

658
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,458
[Lis] Who is that?

659
00:30:53,541 --> 00:30:54,416
[grunts]

660
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,625
-I'm sorry about that.
-No, Ramón, Ramón, uh…

661
00:30:57,875 --> 00:30:59,166
You're very nice.

662
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,500
-But I don't think that you and I--
-I'm sorry.

663
00:31:02,583 --> 00:31:03,458
Um…

664
00:31:04,416 --> 00:31:05,791
-[Ramón] Look…
-[chuckles awkwardly]

665
00:31:05,875 --> 00:31:07,625
Forget this happened, okay?

666
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:10,208
-No, but don't…
-Um, merry Christmas.

667
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:12,291
[electronic dance music continues]

668
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,000
Merry Christmas.
