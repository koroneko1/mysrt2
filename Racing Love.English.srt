1
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:57,807
-Hey!
-Hey!

2
00:00:57,974 --> 00:00:59,434
Do you even know how to drive? Idiot.

3
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,937
-I'm sorry, Sergeant.
-It's "Senior Sergeant."

4
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,566
I was driving fine
until that fat man cut me off.

5
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,568
Now take a look at
what's wrong with my bike.

6
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,362
A familiar face.

7
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,865
-Hello, Officer.
-You again, Jey?

8
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:15,909
You silly toad.

9
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,787
-Officer...
-Give me your license.

10
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,622
Whenever you see me,
you always ask for my license.

11
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,707
If you need one, why don't you
go and get one yourself?

12
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,125
You committed a traffic violation.

13
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:26,044
Just hand me your license
and I'll give you a ticket.

14
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:28,922
Please, I'm begging you.
I have to deliver more flowers.

15
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:31,633
Delivering flowers has nothing to do
with traffic violations.

16
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,468
-So are you going to arrest me?
-Yes.

17
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,221
-Catch me if you can, boss.
-What are you doing, Jey?

18
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,097
What am I going to do?
I'm going to go full speed!

19
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,766
Bye, boss.

20
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,979
You just insulted an officer.
I'm going to catch you on the other side.

21
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:48,566
That won't be easy.

22
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:49,943
Stop!

23
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,078
Hey! Are you a policeman or a slingshot?
You're way too fast.

24
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:01,830
How can you drive like this, Jey?

25
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,374
What? If you're brave enough to stop me,
you had better arrest me.

26
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:05,917
Don't push me, Jey.

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,544
You have a lot of offenses already,

28
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:10,797
like scraping a motorbike
and bumping an officer.

29
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,007
And driving too fast.
How did you speed up to 180km?

30
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,260
-A hundred and eighty? Are you crazy?
-Why?

31
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:19,806
This tuk-tuk can only reach 80km
You can't arrest me for that.

32
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,599
Oh, really?

33
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,768
I will find a reason for sure.

34
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,229
Sergeant, you don't have to look around.

35
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,146
What?

36
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,857
I already renewed
my license and registration.

37
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,483
-And the insurance papers are here.
-Really?

38
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,194
-Are you hiding drugs in here?
-I have to go.

39
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,363
That hurt!

40
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,866
Jey!

41
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:40,243
-What?
-Come back here!

42
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,538
What's wrong?

43
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,999
Do you want me to go or to come back?
You're giving me a headache.

44
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,333
You drove over my foot! See?

45
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:49,794
I couldn't have done that.
Even if I could, I wouldn't have done it.

46
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,795
Stop being a smart-ass.

47
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,756
-Can you see it now?
-Okay, I will buy you some medicine.

48
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,635
No!

49
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,388
-Jey, you did it again!
-I'm sorry, Sergeant.

50
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,390
I wanted to know
if you are allergic to any medicine.

51
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,686
No, I have never been allergic to anything
in my whole life except my own hair.

52
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,855
-Oh, okay.
-Just go!

53
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:12,191
Jey, you!

54
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:19,866
Look at that guy driving the tuk-tuk.

55
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,868
That's no way to drive.

56
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:24,245
Look, he's turning right,
but he's signaling for the left lane.

57
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:26,748
I need to know
how he passed his driving exam.

58
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,666
Did his license fall from a tree?

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:34,672
Hey, Fatty, do you know how to drive?

60
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,841
Just wait and see.

61
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,846
Boss, just follow him. Hurry up.

62
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,895
Wait for us, Fatty!

63
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,189
-If we catch up to you,
-Just shut up!

64
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,067
-we will kick your butt.
-You will?

65
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,361
Damn you, Fatty!

66
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,615
Fatty!

67
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:03,910
So you think you're fast? Let's see!

68
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:05,286
Hey, boss. He just cut us off again.

69
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,580
Hey!

70
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,378
Hello, Ms. Kamhom.

71
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,133
Stop. I'm Ton.

72
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:23,888
-It's Ton.
-Here!

73
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,724
It's not going to get in your eyes.

74
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,477
Not in my eyes, but in my heart, okay?

75
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,814
Why are you here?

76
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,358
-You're not fixing cars today?
-Kamhom.

77
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,819
How many times have I told you?
I'm not a mechanic.

78
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,488
Whatever. It's none of my business.

79
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:41,990
Anyway, why are you here?

80
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,102
The flowers are here.

81
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:14,731
Wow, Jey, you always arrive on time.

82
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:20,778
You are so cute!

83
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:37,045
She pinched my cheek.

84
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,682
Hey.

85
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:54,062
Are you selling scraps?

86
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,067
How much will you pay me?

87
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,027
I will use the money to build a tombstone.

88
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:02,612
What?

89
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,531
You have got too much attitude, Jey.

90
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:09,160
I'm your uncle.
You better show me some respect.

91
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,079
I know you're my uncle.

92
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,914
If you weren't my mom's brother...

93
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:15,124
-So what?
-we wouldn't live together for this long.

94
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,585
-What are you doing to help me out?
-Help you out with what?

95
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:20,338
You get free rent, free food.
I pay for everything.

96
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,215
Do you pay for anything?

97
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,801
Hey. Don't you appreciate
the kindness I show you?

98
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,928
How much did you love your wife?

99
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,305
Of course, I loved her so much.

100
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,099
Here is a real gentleman.

101
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,935
If you loved her so much,
why didn't you follow her when she died?

102
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:36,771
I was going to follow her,
but I couldn't catch the bus.

103
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,810
Klod, you have to win.

104
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,230
Knock him down!

105
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:23,818
Klod, beat him to death!

106
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:26,696
Kill him!

107
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,086
What?

108
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,088
-Come on.
-Knock him out.

109
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,850
Good job, Klod, my best friend!

110
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,062
Move.

111
00:08:00,271 --> 00:08:03,191
Pay up. You bet 3-1. I remember.

112
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,991
Keep your promise.

113
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:15,786
If I win, you stop bothering
my shop and my family.

114
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:18,664
Leave me alone.

115
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,500
I hope you understand what I'm saying.

116
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,585
It won't be that easy.

117
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,855
-Kamhom?
-Klod!

118
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,440
Let's go. Quick.

119
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,194
-Go where?
-I'm being chased.

120
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,445
-Let's go. Quick!
-Hey!

121
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,239
Stop! Klod, I'm warning you!

122
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,044
Quick!

123
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:17,932
You're going to die!

124
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,240
How long are you going to hug me?

125
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,242
We're already here.

126
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,079
Where am I? This is not my house.

127
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:42,540
Your house is over there.

128
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,709
Oh, right.

129
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,088
Okay, I will get off now.

130
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,759
Are you going to go now?

131
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:56,721
Wait!

132
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:57,847
Klod!

133
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:01,934
Klod! What about this flower?

134
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:07,231
We are now back at
the Kaeng Krachan Circuit in Phetchaburi

135
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,817
for Thailand Auto Car Racing.

136
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,235
A lot of people have turned up today,

137
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,739
including many fans
of the Singha Racing School.

138
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,533
Here is number 11, Mr. Karan Supapong.

139
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,952
All the cars are at the starting line.

140
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:25,708
Jack Lamwatt is off first,
with Gunnasak in second.

141
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,420
This is the Thailand
Touring Car Championship

142
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,838
of the Pro Racing Series program.

143
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:34,508
Jack Lamwatt is in the lead,
followed by Umar Earaman.

144
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,346
-Umar is trying to get the lead right now.
-You dare cut me off?

145
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:41,599
Somchai Saksriwejkul
has just passed Jack Lamwatt.

146
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,684
-Somchai is now leading the race.
-You can't outdrive me!

147
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,020
Karan Supapong is now leading...

148
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,605
Victory will be mine on the next curve.

149
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,566
...and behind Karan is Jack Lamwatt,
followed by Umar Earaman.

150
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,901
-Jey!
-Hey!

151
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,444
What are you doing, Jey?

152
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:55,279
-Jack is keeping up with Karan...
-I...

153
00:10:55,363 --> 00:10:57,698
-but Karan still manages to lead.
-I just...

154
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,033
I am...

155
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,495
I...

156
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:05,956
I didn't know
you wanted to be a race car driver.

157
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,209
-I do.
-That's awesome.

158
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,920
You can practice with the TV.

159
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:13,547
All right. Is there something
I can do for you?

160
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:19,303
I was just wondering if you went
to the boxing match last night.

161
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,014
I was. I almost got my money.

162
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,808
There shouldn't have been
a shoot-out last night.

163
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,228
I didn't want to get caught
in the crossfire, so I left early.

164
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,022
Well, why are you asking?

165
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,942
Uma Earaman is just right behind Karan.

166
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:36,404
Oh, that. I'm glad that you're safe.

167
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,573
-I was wondering
-There, the chase is so exciting.

168
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,284
-if you could do me a favor today.
-He's lifting one wheel, look at Jack.

169
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,372
Sure. I would do you a thousand favors
for you, Kamhom.

170
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,389
Please give this to Klod.

171
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:06,475
Sure.

172
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,854
Thank you so much, Jey.
Don't forget to give this to Klod.

173
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:10,813
I will.

174
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,108
I'm leaving now.

175
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,404
-Don't forget to give that to him.
-Sure.

176
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,072
Give that to Klod.

177
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:22,867
All she thinks about is Klod.

178
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,008
Oh, my...

179
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,052
You seem happy, don't you?

180
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,807
You are always out all day
delivering flowers.

181
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,143
Why don't you stay
and look after our shop?

182
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,521
I have errands to run too, you know.

183
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:55,816
I know what you mean
by running errands, Mommy.

184
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,527
It's gambling, right?

185
00:12:58,652 --> 00:13:02,114
They're just brain exercises.
I'm afraid of getting Alpheimer.

186
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,073
Hey.

187
00:13:03,157 --> 00:13:06,535
-It's "Alzheimer's."
-Whatever.

188
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:11,332
At your age,
your brain can't get any better.

189
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:16,253
Stop making fun of me.

190
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:22,051
I know who you sent those flowers to.

191
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,845
You know what, Kamhom?

192
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,598
He's not interested in you.

193
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,726
No matter how many flowers you give him,
he won't appreciate them.

194
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,021
But I hope that, one day,

195
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:37,191
he will realize the meaning
of the flowers I gave him.

196
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,196
Fai, could you wrap the flowers for me
and bring them to the car, please?

197
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,703
He's fast, isn't he?

198
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,163
Too fast.

199
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,796
Klod has always been so aggressive.
He can't control his emotions.

200
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,465
You can tell how he drives
just by the noise.

201
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,425
His mind is much faster than his car.

202
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,096
Each loop is never completed
in the same amount of time.

203
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:14,812
But this other guy,
his car is faster than his mind.

204
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,947
You have the skills, Ton,
but you're not brave enough.

205
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,657
I want to know what's on your mind.

206
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,076
To be a good driver, you must be decisive.

207
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,454
-That's true.
-Klod, you are way too reckless.

208
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,915
Your driving skills aren't there yet.

209
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,086
Not only do you look horrible,

210
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:41,171
but your driving is also horrible.

211
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:42,840
You bastards.

212
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,467
Don't dream of the trophy yet.

213
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,469
Klod, you're way too aggressive.

214
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:51,682
And you, Ton, you keep hesitating.

215
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,768
You had better try to finish a race first.

216
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,817
I better not see such a performance
from you guys again.

217
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,488
Just look at those guys

218
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,283
who dream of being race car drivers.

219
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:12,953
Their only opponent

220
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,914
is their self.

221
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,501
The most ambitious one,

222
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:22,129
the one who tries the hardest,

223
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:24,048
will become the best.

224
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,678
Choo, here are the flowers you ordered.

225
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,224
Choo.

226
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,895
-Choo.
-Hey. Who's there?

227
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,064
You scared me.

228
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,232
-Hello.
-It's you, Kamhom.

229
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:44,860
You shouldn't have come all the way here.

230
00:15:44,943 --> 00:15:45,945
It's no problem.

231
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,197
You're a regular customer.
I'm happy to be of service.

232
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,032
You're lovely as always.

233
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,158
Here are the flowers.

234
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,910
They are very beautiful.

235
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,078
-Hey.
-Yes?

236
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,330
-Let me find you something to drink.
-No, thanks.

237
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,873
-I insist.
-I'm just here to deliver them.

238
00:15:57,956 --> 00:15:59,375
I will get you some coffee, okay?

239
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,585
-Don't bother.
-You came all the way.

240
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,421
-Let me do something for you.
-No need. I was obligated to bring them.

241
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,011
Amazing.

242
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,846
Tod looks super cool.

243
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:14,556
Look at him.

244
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,016
Kamhom.

245
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,606
Choo.

246
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,900
You're such a klutz.

247
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:26,944
-What?
-A klutz.

248
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,405
-I have to run to the bathroom.
-Okay.

249
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:32,408
Why am I always so clumsy?

250
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,538
It won't wash off.

251
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,262
You pervert! Why are you in here?

252
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,181
Ask yourself. Why are you here?

253
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:26,920
Am I there yet?

254
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:32,885
Put the expensive one down first.

255
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:35,304
One.

256
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,476
Two.

257
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,187
Three.

258
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,688
Put it nicely here.

259
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:47,232
And four. Okay.

260
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,692
It's done.

261
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:55,949
These trophies.

262
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,534
Oh, my!

263
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,328
They're all here.

264
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,163
Mr. Tod!

265
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,832
You're so cool, Mr. Tod.

266
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,752
Oh, this is the one from the Royal's Cup.

267
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,590
A trophy here, a trophy there.
There are trophies everywhere!

268
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,258
Amazing.

269
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,845
It would be an honor if I could touch one.

270
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:39,576
Yes!

271
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,376
Yes!

272
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:55,926
-How do you like my trophy?
-It looks great. Can I take a look?

273
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,594
No, it's mine.

274
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:59,429
-Please. Can I take a quick look?
-Don't touch it.

275
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:03,100
-Please let me take a quick look.
-No. Let go of it.

276
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,477
-Jey, let me see it real quick.
-It's mine. Give it back to me.

277
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:08,313
-Just a small peek, please.
-If you don't let go, I will kiss you.

278
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,279
Why did you slap me, girl?

279
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,156
Do I look like a girl to you?

280
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,457
I guess he has never
greeted anyone properly.

281
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,042
Hello, sir.

282
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,796
I am...

283
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:37,009
I'm sorry I touched the trophy
without permission.

284
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:39,011
There are a lot of trophies.

285
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,513
All the best racers
must be from your team.

286
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:46,518
I believe your team
is the leading team in Thailand, sir.

287
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:49,897
I would love to touch these cups
because I don't have one at home.

288
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,066
-What? You don't have one?
-I don't.

289
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,778
So what do you use
to drink your coffee, then?

290
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,995
Whatever. What's your name?

291
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:06,914
My name is Jey.

292
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,916
You stopped laughing so suddenly.

293
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:10,667
-Kamhom and I are friends.
-I see.

294
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:15,172
When I have free time, I drive her
so she can deliver flowers.

295
00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:16,673
To be honest, sir,

296
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:22,012
I have no limit when it comes to driving.

297
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:26,516
I can even speed up to 120kph
at a 90-degree bend

298
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,560
without touching the brakes.

299
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,939
Would it be possible
for me to be on your team?

300
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,608
Well, you see...

301
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:38,445
I'm going to be honest with you,

302
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,364
man.

303
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:42,199
You can't be a race car driver.

304
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,327
How come?

305
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:51,959
To be a race car driver,
you must have discipline.

306
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,919
And you must practice regularly.

307
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,463
If you don't show up to practice,

308
00:20:57,464 --> 00:20:59,174
you will get cut from the team.

309
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:02,135
And if you get cut,

310
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,055
can you stand
being even shorter than this?

311
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,899
If you were my manager,
I would beat you up.

312
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:16,900
What did you say?

313
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,946
Choo!

314
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:26,285
Choo, the manager asked you
to mop the floor.

315
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:30,497
And have you prepared the cars
for the drivers yet?

316
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,249
Don't just stand there.

317
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,458
Jeez.

318
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,260
So you're a slave.

319
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,097
"Servant" sounds better.

320
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,235
-Can I tell you one thing?
-Sure.

321
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,029
Your jokes don't work, jerk.

322
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,321
Noted.

323
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,645
Why are you scratching it like that?

324
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,105
This is a race car.

325
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,525
What should I do?
I really want to be a race car driver.

326
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,985
-Do you have heart?
-Absolutely.

327
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,737
-Do you have any money?
-Less than 100 baht.

328
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,572
Oh, dear. Just keep that for the arcade.

329
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:46,615
Why?

330
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,825
Does having no money mean you can't dream?

331
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:50,368
Just go to sleep and dream at home, then.

332
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:53,663
Stop touching the car.
I will get in trouble if someone sees you.

333
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:56,124
Oh, look.

334
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,752
Look at that guy, boss.

335
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,338
I think I have seen him before.

336
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,924
Who is that? He is really familiar.

337
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:06,551
He's the guy I told you about.

338
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,429
-Really?
-Yes.

339
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,640
Hey, you.

340
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,226
-Our boss would like to talk to you.
-Yes.

341
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,729
-Oh, no.
-Choo! Get him!

342
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,648
-Hey, fatty! Come here!
-Come here!

343
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,817
-Wait a minute.
-Bring him here, Choo!

344
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,278
-There. I'm in trouble.
-He's such a troublemaker.

345
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,114
Oh, Choo.

346
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:28,698
We'll be right back.

347
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,534
-Wait!
-Quickly! Run!

348
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:31,493
Stop it!

349
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:32,702
Get up!

350
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,870
Hey!

351
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:34,830
-Damn!
-Hey!

352
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,831
Kamhom!

353
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,541
Kamhom, we need to leave.

354
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,460
-Get in the car.
-Wait. What happened, Jey?

355
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,046
The racing mafia is about to kill me.
Get in the car. I will drive.

356
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:44,714
-Really?
-Get in now.

357
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,675
Fatty! Stop!

358
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,885
-Where is he going?
-Fatty!

359
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,262
What the hell?

360
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:53,932
-Stop the car!
-Stop!

361
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,100
Fatty!

362
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,436
My boss just wants to talk to you.

363
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,481
What's wrong with you, Fatty?
You better come back here.

364
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,610
He's not a fatty.
He's just chubby like me.

365
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,331
Whose car is this? It's so beautiful.

366
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:25,005
It's an Audi. It's gorgeous.

367
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,425
You're Jey, right? We need to talk.

368
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,636
I'm so sorry. I'm in the wrong house.

369
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,141
Your uncle has already told us
how fast you drive.

370
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,310
Him? He's not my uncle.

371
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:40,187
He's a security guard at this garage.

372
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,023
You damned nephew.
I'm a security guard now, am I?

373
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,734
-You're in a lot of trouble.
-Who slapped me?

374
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:48,737
-He's gone.
-Only a loser would hit me like that.

375
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,155
Jeez.

376
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,615
If you are a real gentleman,

377
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:53,283
race me in the circuit,

378
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:56,203
don't slap me like that.

379
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,662
What can you do?

380
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:00,665
So?

381
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:12,969
Back elbow strike!

382
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,139
Hand me a weapon.

383
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,351
You're going to get it.

384
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,896
-That one is too small.
-What?

385
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,110
Hey!

386
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,403
What's going on?

387
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,657
-So what can you do?
-Nothing.

388
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,699
-What?
-What?

389
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,117
But I will fight to the death.

390
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,702
Hey!

391
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:56,930
SINGHA RACING SCHOOL

392
00:25:57,013 --> 00:25:59,307
Welcome to Singha Racing School.

393
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,643
-Thanks, Klod, my dearest brother.
-I'm so happy for you, Jey.

394
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,061
Me too.

395
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:06,106
-Is this the new idol?
-Shut up.

396
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,775
You're just a servant.

397
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,278
Dealing with me isn't so easy.

398
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,488
Not easy, is it?

399
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:17,701
-You have got some guts.
-Don't touch me.

400
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:20,537
Easy come, easy go.

401
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,248
-Why?
-Jey.

402
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,585
-You should get to know Choosak.
-That's not necessary.

403
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,046
He's the chief mechanic.

404
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,964
Hello, Mr. Choo.

405
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:33,717
I bought some food for you.

406
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,970
You're such a nice guy. Come on, smile.

407
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:41,683
You're pretty smart.
You know how to kiss ass straight away.

408
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,851
I'm yours now, sir.

409
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,228
We won't have problems
if you keep bringing me food.

410
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,356
-Where is the living room?
-Over there.

411
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,442
-May I be excused?
-Sure.

412
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:51,776
Wait a minute.

413
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,946
Jey, there's the car
that needs an oil change.

414
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,531
It's hoisted over there.

415
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,491
-Here--
-Hey, Ton. Let me go.

416
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,577
-Why?
-I'm not a mechanic.

417
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:04,956
I'm the next champion racer of Thailand.

418
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,207
Everyone, make way for me.

419
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,293
-Go right ahead!
-Shut up!

420
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,588
Shut up! No one move!

421
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:14,966
You're a mechanic.

422
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,469
You're just a delivery guy who got lucky.

423
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,972
The boss saw something in you,
so he put you on our team.

424
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:23,683
Stop dreaming and get back to work.

425
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,063
"Welcome to Singha Racing School."

426
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,357
Why do I have to clean the tires?

427
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,154
Hey. Move.

428
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,615
I haven't liked the look of him
since day one.

429
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,075
That fat dwarf.

430
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,618
Not you.

431
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,749
Hey, Jey.

432
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,626
What are you doing?

433
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,212
Are you working?

434
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,382
There's no need to work today.

435
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,718
I said no work today.
Don't be such a workaholic.

436
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:00,887
Just like what that scholar said,
"No work today."

437
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,890
We can relax today.
There's no need to work.

438
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,725
-Relax?
-Yes.

439
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,019
-How exactly do you relax?
-With this.

440
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,564
No.

441
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,525
I don't gamble.

442
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,569
If you don't gamble,

443
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,738
then that means you don't respect me.

444
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,493
All right, then. For your honor.

445
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,372
On second thought,
I don't have any money to gamble.

446
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,166
Hey. You don't need money for this.

447
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,085
We just gamble, man to man.

448
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,628
If you lose, I punch you.

449
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,133
Do you want to play rummy?

450
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,593
-There's too much thinking involved.
-Poker, then.

451
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,387
-I don't know how to play that.
-Make Ten?

452
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:44,264
-I'm bad at math.
-Blackjack?

453
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,766
-That's too fast.
-So what do you want to play?

454
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:48,685
War.

455
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,482
Be prepared to get punched.

456
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,153
Son, you have no idea
that I was born for this game.

457
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:00,613
Set up the table.

458
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,241
-Use the tablecloth.
-Quick.

459
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,370
-Where is he?
-Hey!

460
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,330
-Are you here?
-Who turned the lights off?

461
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,248
Just set the table!

462
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,670
-Go ahead.
-You do it.

463
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,300
Do you want to cut the deck?

464
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,510
There's no need.

465
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,304
Are you scared I might cheat?

466
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,515
If you know how to cheat,

467
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:30,226
you would not be working here.

468
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:33,855
You go first.

469
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,442
-Two of clubs?
-That's the lowest.

470
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:41,404
Three of spades.

471
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:43,323
Four of diamonds.

472
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:45,992
Five of hearts.

473
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:47,577
Six of clubs.

474
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,371
Seven of diamonds.

475
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,081
Eight of hearts.

476
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,375
Nine of diamonds.

477
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:58,129
-Nine of spades.
-You only won because of the suit.

478
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:07,931
Do you want to play some more?

479
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,099
Of course.

480
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,185
You go first.

481
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,104
Nine of clubs, two of hearts.
My score is 11.

482
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,274
Ten of spades.

483
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:19,692
Hey!

484
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,448
Why did he turn two cards at once in War?

485
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,993
You don't need to be here.
Just go work at a casino.

486
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,794
Hey, go check that.

487
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,632
It's locked.

488
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,301
Go ahead.

489
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,098
Stop!

490
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,517
What are you doing here?

491
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,436
I'm going to call the police.

492
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,022
"Call the police"?

493
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:01,401
You nosy bitch.

494
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,324
Klod, watch out!

495
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,246
Klod, watch out!

496
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,664
Damn you.

497
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,500
Klod!

498
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,671
-Police! The police are here!
-Guys!

499
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:22,755
There's the police!

500
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,259
Klod, are you hurt?

501
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,261
I'm okay.

502
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,308
Klod, you risked your life to help me.

503
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,437
It wasn't because of you.
I was worried about my shop.

504
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,946
We're at your house now. Get off.

505
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,200
Now.

506
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,165
You saved my life again.

507
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,292
Aren't you scared at all?

508
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:00,752
What's wrong with you?

509
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,046
You're always in danger.

510
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,631
But you're always there for me.

511
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,383
Do you even realize
that I'm scolding you right now?

512
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:11,554
I should have left you with the mafia.

513
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:14,766
Are you leaving now?

514
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,393
Klod.

515
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:22,148
JAMNONG REPAIR SHOP

516
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,860
Why are you thinking so much?

517
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,571
Kamhom is getting annoying.

518
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:30,406
Don't you understand?

519
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:35,161
I can't even help myself.

520
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:39,082
And now with Kamhom...

521
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,168
I don't know what to do with my life.

522
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,003
Jey.

523
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:48,049
Please convince Kamhom to leave me alone.

524
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,760
-Hey!
-What's that?

525
00:32:50,843 --> 00:32:52,553
Is that what you think of her?

526
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,556
Take it easy.

527
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,849
But it's okay.

528
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,894
I plan to adopt a sugar baby.

529
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,772
And I will take care
of Kamhom for you, okay?

530
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,024
How about taking care of yourself first?

531
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:06,693
I don't have to worry
since I live with you.

532
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,403
Even though I don't want her
to get involved,

533
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,531
Kamhom is not an object
that belongs to anyone.

534
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,076
Listen to him. Use your brain.

535
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,787
Hey. Don't be selfish.

536
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,249
If you don't like her,
why did you protect her?

537
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,375
Slow down.

538
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,585
-Why don't you ask your heart?
-Uncle.

539
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,504
-What are you thinking?
-That's good.

540
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:29,173
-I'm talking to him.
-Good, Uncle.

541
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,508
-What?
-Stop talking.

542
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:37,432
Jey, Kamhom is the only one
who can encourage me.

543
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:43,730
Jey, you must help me
because you are so close to her.

544
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,815
Why do I have to help you?

545
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:49,068
Because we are colleagues.

546
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:50,570
-"Colleagues."
-Yes.

547
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,196
I might not pass the probation period.

548
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:00,872
We are like brothers.

549
00:34:04,041 --> 00:34:05,835
We are both humans.

550
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,716
-We're both males.
-If we're both males,

551
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,093
that means we are even.

552
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:15,344
And why do I have to help you?

553
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:21,100
Because you and I look alike.

554
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,478
That's true.

555
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:27,398
So that means you agree to help me?

556
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,569
You know what?

557
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:35,406
Nothing in this world is free.

558
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:36,657
That means

559
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,826
you have to do something for me.

560
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,997
-We will start with the first course.
-Okay.

561
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,582
This is the standard course

562
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:48,795
that teaches you how to drive safely
under traffic regulations.

563
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:52,882
Hey, Ton, I don't need this course.
This is for kids.

564
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,928
So you want a harder course.

565
00:34:57,261 --> 00:35:01,641
The next one is for an aspiring racer.

566
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,768
Wait. Were you on Broadway?

567
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,228
-It's important.
-What's that?

568
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:08,898
This course will teach you
both the theory and the operations.

569
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:11,150
You will know about pit stops,
the manner of racing,

570
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:13,110
and all the signs and signals.

571
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:14,654
That sounds good.

572
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:20,493
And after this course,
you will become a professional.

573
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,954
-The hardest course.
-Yes.

574
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,081
I would really love to learn this course.

575
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,083
-Let's start with the hardest course?
-Yes.

576
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,876
You're a real man.

577
00:35:29,752 --> 00:35:31,462
Please, Mr. Choo.

578
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,840
Why are you talking so politely?

579
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,759
Help me. Please.

580
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,474
Mr. Choo. Help me.

581
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:47,854
You're paying for the course in full?

582
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,439
-What's wrong with your voice?
-Hey.

583
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:53,401
Teaching is not that hard,

584
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,612
but Jey, will you have time to work?

585
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:58,489
It's fine.

586
00:35:58,573 --> 00:36:02,159
I work Mondays to Fridays,
so you will teach me on the weekend.

587
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,120
Everybody else is resting,
but I will be studying.

588
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,037
Is that okay with you?

589
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,873
Sure.

590
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:08,624
How about the car?

591
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,504
The car?

592
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,090
If you're going to have a race car,

593
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,301
the car must belong to you.

594
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,219
There are fixing and modifying costs.

595
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:25,349
Do you have any money?

596
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,643
I didn't think so.

597
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,021
Go back to being a mechanic, then.

598
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,564
Hey.

599
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:34,066
It's not too difficult, Jey.

600
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:38,404
Just save some money.

601
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:42,074
If you want to own an expensive car,
just save one baht a day.

602
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:47,288
It will only take 2,739 years.

603
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,706
Can I wait that long?

604
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,297
Do I need to remind you
where you came from?

605
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,299
You're just a tuk-tuk driver.
Do you understand?

606
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,967
Don't even dream
of being a race car driver.

607
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,928
Hey, man.

608
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,596
You have talked to me that way
so many times.

609
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:04,805
So what?

610
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,183
Have you seen yourself?

611
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,894
-You're an ugly toad.
-You're crossing the line.

612
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,313
You dream of becoming a racer.
I don't understand.

613
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,857
-Do you even have a brain?
-Hey, man.

614
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,984
-Can your leg even touch the gas pedal?
-That's rude.

615
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,569
-Can you reach the radio?
-That's enough.

616
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,237
If you want to be a race car driver,

617
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,240
you might have to use a walker
to step on the gas.

618
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,993
You're an idiot. Do you understand?

619
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,168
You hurt my leg, Jey!

620
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,058
There's no need to be upset.

621
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,351
Jeez.

622
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,520
Every problem can be solved.

623
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:55,356
This isn't so difficult.

624
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:59,443
To be a race car driver,
I must have my own car.

625
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:03,197
Being a driver
who doesn't have his own car,

626
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,866
is like having a heart
that has never been in love.

627
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,703
Yuck!

628
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,372
I can help with the car.

629
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:13,165
-Really?
-Yes.

630
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,501
Don't tell me you're going
to steal someone else's car.

631
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:17,336
I don't want it. I'm a good person.

632
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,381
Have you become a good person already?

633
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:21,882
All right.

634
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:25,177
For the car, you can talk to Ton and Klod.

635
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,470
Okay?

636
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,098
-Sure
-It's time.

637
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,850
Time for what?

638
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,062
Give it to me.

639
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:38,899
-What?
-The plastic bag.

640
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,901
Why didn't you tell me?

641
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,158
Why do you need the plastic bag?

642
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,958
You're the only one
I can trust these days.

643
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:00,504
You have to keep this a secret, okay?

644
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,590
Don't tell anyone at all.

645
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,259
Come here. I want to tell you something.

646
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:09,847
What?

647
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,767
You want me to be...

648
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,893
A love consultant?

649
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,191
-I want to tell you something.
-My ear is up here.

650
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:33,371
They don't have anything large
for the drivers.

651
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,789
How can I fit in this size?

652
00:39:35,581 --> 00:39:38,501
Jey, the uniforms are custom-made
for starting racers,

653
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,960
not substitutes.

654
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,923
-Okay.
-It's good to see you today.

655
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,467
Last time, I passed by Kamhom's shop.

656
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,095
I saw you and Kamhom
eating dinner together.

657
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:53,891
You told me you would help me,
but I haven't seen Kamhom at all.

658
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,685
Everybody should do
everything by themselves.

659
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,562
What did you say?

660
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,317
I want to help you, but I have no time.

661
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,652
I see.

662
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,821
How about helping me
find the uniforms, then?

663
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,240
How about being a wrestler?

664
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:11,117
Let's do this like sumo.

665
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:16,205
-Wait. Is this going to work?
-Push it.

666
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,541
I'll hold my breath
and you press my tummy, okay?

667
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:19,834
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

668
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,130
Zip it up.

669
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:29,009
-Stay still.
-Zip it up.

670
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:37,101
That hurts! My skin! It hurts!

671
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,145
-I told you to press this first.
-Let's try this again.

672
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,856
Wait.

673
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:44,984
My arm!

674
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,485
-My arm hurts.
-Put it in.

675
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,989
-There you go.
-Put it in. Okay, the other one.

676
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,073
Are you okay?

677
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:55,119
-Pull the sleeves up. Yes.
-How is that?

678
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,495
Zip it up now. On my count.

679
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,705
-One, two.
-One, two.

680
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,417
-Yes!
-Yes! We're done!

681
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,334
Believe me,

682
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:04,545
I am happier to fit in this
than to be a champion.

683
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:09,425
Love consultant!

684
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,595
I swear on a bunch of olives,

685
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,431
I'm the number one love consultant.

686
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,225
I hereby proclaim the oath
of love consultants...

687
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:20,895
Rule number one.

688
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:23,314
I must be the reflection of the problem.

689
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,067
What kind of person is Klod?

690
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:31,572
I sent him flowers,
but he didn't even smile at me.

691
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:40,206
I think I'm doing my best
as a woman in love.

692
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,458
Jey, what should I do?

693
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,460
-Jey.
-Yes?

694
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,421
Jey, you're not helping me
with my problems.

695
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,547
I would like to help,

696
00:41:48,631 --> 00:41:53,719
but to solve your problem,
I need to have more information.

697
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,304
Can you give me more information?

698
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,643
Rules of love consultants.

699
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,728
There are too many rules.

700
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,899
If I follow only a few of them,
no one would know.

701
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:08,943
2. GIVE CHOICES, NOT ANSWERS

702
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:10,945
Rule number two.

703
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,364
Love consultants must give choices,

704
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:15,074
not answers.

705
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:19,745
I have a way to get Kamhom
out of your life.

706
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,497
What's that?

707
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:22,623
The only solution.

708
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,793
Tell her the truth.
You don't like her and you hate her.

709
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,336
Just tell her. It's as simple as that.

710
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:29,964
Are there any other solutions?

711
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,967
I'm not a good person,

712
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,512
but I don't want to make a woman cry.

713
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,305
How manly of you.

714
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:42,309
Come on. This is the best way.
It will be quick.

715
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:46,230
Rule number three, don't force things.

716
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,026
You said that rule number three is,
"Don't force things."

717
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:54,113
Just listen. Do as I told you.

718
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:56,323
-You don't like her, right?
-Yes.

719
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,783
Didn't you tell me she's annoying?

720
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,995
She's over there. Go tell her.

721
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,538
Are you scared?

722
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,498
Are you a real man?

723
00:43:04,581 --> 00:43:06,917
-Hey.
-What a coward.

724
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:10,921
-Hey.
-Don't waste time. Go tell her now.

725
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,467
-What are you doing here?
-Klod.

726
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,428
I have told you so many times.
Leave me alone.

727
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,187
Sure.

728
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,368
-Peekaboo!
-Oh, jeez!

729
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,411
I'm back.

730
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:46,540
I'm used to that now.

731
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:48,542
Flowers for you.

732
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:52,254
Hey! I'm serious this time.

733
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,506
You should find someone who loves you.

734
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,467
Don't waste your time on me.

735
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,552
I have never loved you.

736
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:00,512
I have never cared about you.

737
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,560
Hey.

738
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,862
You're so mean.

739
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,368
Are you really mad at me?

740
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,416
If you didn't care, why did you ask?

741
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,019
Stop crying.

742
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,366
Were those crocodile tears?

743
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:03,700
Were they?

744
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:06,870
You're so cute when you're being kind.

745
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,525
Excuse me.

746
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,609
Oh, jeez.

747
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:46,869
Does it hurt?

748
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,495
Here's an ointment.

749
00:45:51,665 --> 00:45:52,499
Kamhom.

750
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:54,376
I think

751
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:59,923
you should look for someone else.

752
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,217
If there...

753
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:07,431
is another guy who might like you,

754
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,184
you should give him a chance.

755
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:12,227
Jey.

756
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,356
Why do you like forcing me
to do this and that?

757
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:21,069
That's the guy
who told you to tell me this, right?

758
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,990
If he's going to tell you something,
what would you say?

759
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:28,243
If he's brave enough,
he can come inside. I'm right here.

760
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,835
The weather is so nice today.

761
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,296
Here is a flower for you, Kamhom.

762
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,427
Thanks.

763
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:52,976
Kamhom!

764
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,395
Why did you do this to me?

765
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:57,481
-I'm in a bad mood today.
-Look at all this blood.

766
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,566
"A bad mood"?

767
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,235
-Jey.
-What?

768
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,654
Didn't even check her mood?
Look at all this blood.

769
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,822
How about you leave
and wait for me at home?

770
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:06,740
I will be there.

771
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,287
Is he crazy?

772
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:13,997
He came in here when I was in a bad mood.

773
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,460
Take it easy, Kamhom.

774
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:21,129
I...

775
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,677
Take it easy.

776
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,514
Jey.

777
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,224
Jey.

778
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:37,396
I don't understand why the person I like

779
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:40,315
won't even look at me.

780
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,484
Yes.

781
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:46,822
Why does the person we like
never ever look at us?

782
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:48,740
But it's all right.

783
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,701
I can wait.

784
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,411
I will wait

785
00:47:53,161 --> 00:47:57,165
and be beside you forever.

786
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,255
Jey.

787
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:07,384
You sound like you're my boyfriend.

788
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,846
No, not at all.

789
00:48:16,393 --> 00:48:17,436
Rule number four.

790
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:20,397
Love consultants
must always be encouraging.

791
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:22,941
You deserved it.

792
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,152
I told you not to see
Kamhom during that time.

793
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,196
I kept telling you
until my mouth almost exploded,

794
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,198
but you never listen to me.

795
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:32,284
-When the hell did you tell me, dude?
-What?

796
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:34,995
When did you tell me, sir?

797
00:48:35,203 --> 00:48:38,915
You told me you would be on my side.

798
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,420
To be honest with you, I can't do it.

799
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:48,175
Rule number five,
love consultants must not take sides.

800
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:55,766
Jey.

801
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:59,811
Why are you here? Move it. Move.

802
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,690
I can't take sides, you know?
I must be right in the middle.

803
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,192
So you're true to your words?

804
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:07,527
It's great that you're sitting right here.

805
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,280
-I feel so comfortable.
-Sure.

806
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,742
Now you're leaning on her.

807
00:49:13,950 --> 00:49:15,786
COFFEE HOUSE

808
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,290
A cup of coffee, please.

809
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,043
Out of all the coffee shops...

810
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,631
-Klod!
-And now she left for him.

811
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:30,634
-What?
-Have you already ordered something?

812
00:49:30,717 --> 00:49:32,386
-I already did.
-Hey, Klod. Where have you been?

813
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:33,470
-Excuse me, Kamhom.
-Jey.

814
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,431
Oh, dear. Sorry. Have you had breakfast?

815
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,599
-I have.
-You have?

816
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,600
-Yes.
-Good.

817
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,435
What did you eat? Was it yummy?

818
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:41,853
-It was good.
-Okay.

819
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:45,440
Chai has just finished fixing a car.

820
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,900
I plan to do a test drive.

821
00:49:47,526 --> 00:49:49,194
I wonder if anybody
would like to come with me?

822
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,409
Intrega DC5, turbocharged.

823
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,285
It's so fast.

824
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:59,830
-Are you tired?
-I want to drive that.

825
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:01,623
-A little...
-I want to.

826
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,208
-Like always...
-You want to drive, right?

827
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,669
-There. You better help me first.
-I should order some coffee.

828
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:08,338
-I will take care of it.
-Do your job.

829
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,381
Klod.

830
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,093
Rule number six, love consultants
must build other people's confidence.

831
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,056
-Ton.
-What?

832
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,934
Seriously, do you really like Kamhom?

833
00:50:21,017 --> 00:50:22,060
Of course.

834
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,647
I have liked her since the first time
I met her at the parking lot.

835
00:50:25,731 --> 00:50:27,733
-What? The parking lot?
-Yes.

836
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,900
That's so romantic.

837
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,070
It may not really be romantic,

838
00:50:32,863 --> 00:50:34,030
but it's always been in my heart.

839
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:38,076
Have you ever thought

840
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:42,122
that Kamhom might already
have someone else on her mind?

841
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:46,168
What type of person does Kamhom like?

842
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,754
I think that she might like a short guy.

843
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,005
Maybe a tall guy?

844
00:50:50,172 --> 00:50:51,506
She might like a dark-skinned guy.

845
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,175
No, a light-skinned guy.

846
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,010
Maybe a chubby guy.

847
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:56,762
No one likes a chubby guy.

848
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,014
Maybe she likes someone
with a perfect body.

849
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:00,974
What if she already has a boyfriend?

850
00:51:01,141 --> 00:51:03,560
I don't really care. I can wait.

851
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:06,730
If you love someone,
you need to be patient.

852
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:10,776
That's how you show your love, you know?

853
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,655
You will have more enemies, then.

854
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:23,288
Jey, I want to talk to you about Kamhom.

855
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,640
What kind of man carries a handkerchief?

856
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:45,519
Hey, in movies,
the hero tends to carry a handkerchief

857
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:48,271
and he hands it to the heroine
when she cries.

858
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,529
Here. Thank you.

859
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,452
Also, in movies,

860
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:06,164
the heroine tends to tease the hero

861
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,626
by blowing her nose on the handkerchief
and handing it back to him.

862
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:12,921
Have you been reading too many novels?

863
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,549
I could say the same for you.

864
00:52:15,632 --> 00:52:19,261
You also read Broken Heart Club.
That's even more melodramatic.

865
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,805
I'm just killing time.

866
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:25,267
It's a bit sad, really.
I'm just killing time.

867
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:30,313
Well, I'm still glad
I could help you stop crying.

868
00:52:32,023 --> 00:52:32,858
Rule number seven,

869
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:36,361
love consultants cannot be too emotional.

870
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,866
Why do I have to be sad?

871
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,870
There's no need to be sad.

872
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,249
-What are you guys doing?
-What?

873
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:50,959
What are you guys doing?

874
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,961
-Nothing.
-Hey, Jey.

875
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,505
I was just talking to Ton.

876
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:59,092
Talking to him makes me feel pretty good.

877
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,636
It makes me feel comfortable.

878
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,306
-Like being a child again, right?
-Yes, I feel like a kid.

879
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,350
By the way,

880
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,979
Kamhom and Ton
kind of look like each other.

881
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,647
-What?
-Like siblings.

882
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,317
You should ask your dad
if he left any babies around.

883
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:19,195
No, Jey. No way.
I have to tell you something.

884
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:22,115
Seriously, we are all like siblings.

885
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:25,911
Jey, I really respect you.

886
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:29,956
And Ton, you're like my little brother.
You're so cute.

887
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,541
Jey, you're also so cute.

888
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,545
I have to go now. Bye.

889
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:43,261
Being called "little brother"
by the one you love

890
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:46,389
hurts the most.

891
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,392
I agree.

892
00:53:50,977 --> 00:53:54,272
What a sad life.

893
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:58,026
Working during the day
and being a security guard at night.

894
00:53:58,109 --> 00:54:00,153
Poor me.

895
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,450
Hello, Tee.

896
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:07,744
Yes, it's me.

897
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:10,080
It's a big match tonight.
I bet Manchester United will win.

898
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,541
I'm confident.
Manchester United will surely win.

899
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,168
Okay.

900
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:16,920
If they win,

901
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,923
you can get the money I owe you
from the money I win.

902
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,926
That's the deal, all right?

903
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,345
It's a win-win for both of us. Deal.

904
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:32,852
But who has Alex Ferguson's phone number?

905
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:35,855
-I need to tell him.
-So he bets on football.

906
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,567
The boss must know about this.

907
00:54:41,152 --> 00:54:42,278
Hey!

908
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,532
-Who's there?
-That hurt.

909
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,076
Was it just a dog?

910
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:51,121
Why are you howling at this time?
I'm scared.

911
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,415
You won't stop?

912
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:55,750
Hey!

913
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,003
That hurts!

914
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:04,968
You stammering dog.

915
00:55:05,468 --> 00:55:07,178
Why do you howl when you stutter?

916
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:10,890
Did he just break my head?

917
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,480
Where is he?

918
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,899
He's so fast.

919
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,986
I will let the boss know.

920
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,783
-Hey. Jey!
-What?

921
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:29,826
What did you do?

922
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,369
He's not going to die.

923
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:38,710
I didn't really want to bet tonight.
I always lose money.

924
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,173
My eyes are somehow twitching.
I don't think Lady Luck is with me.

925
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:47,594
I'm getting scared
for tonight's Bayern VS Munich match.

926
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:52,432
-Choo.
-Yes?

927
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:59,189
No. Listen to me first, Klod.

928
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,983
This isn't what you think.

929
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,737
Klod, listen to me first.

930
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,030
Wait.

931
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,366
I'm running out of blood.

932
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:14,245
Oh, dear. Why did you punch him?

933
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:16,956
This is between him and me.

934
00:56:17,999 --> 00:56:20,877
-Why didn't you tell me first?
-I tried to tell you.

935
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,045
I called your name.

936
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,298
I said, "Klod!" repeatedly.
Did you listen to me at all?

937
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:33,932
First, you told me your plan

938
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,726
was not to hurt me.

939
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,273
I don't mind being hurt,

940
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:45,193
but I'm afraid that Vichakarn

941
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:48,988
will see the blood on the floor.

942
00:56:49,823 --> 00:56:53,535
-Has the bleeding stopped yet?
-Not yet.

943
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,122
A thousand baht for the blood to stop?

944
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,792
1,200 baht?

945
00:57:03,044 --> 00:57:04,295
1,300 baht?

946
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:07,257
1,700 baht?

947
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,718
Okay, how about 2,000?

948
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:11,803
The blood has dried.

949
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:14,556
Okay, 200 baht for now, then.

950
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,099
Damn!

951
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,518
-You said 2,000.
-Take it easy.

952
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,020
I will get some wipes
and clean up the blood.

953
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,105
Let me take the car first.

954
00:57:22,355 --> 00:57:24,274
You're a pain in the ass.

955
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,951
Jey, I got punched
too many times last night.

956
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:38,329
I can't even use face cream.

957
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,623
-You better pay me.
-Klod was the one who did that.

958
00:57:40,707 --> 00:57:42,667
I didn't do anything.

959
00:57:42,750 --> 00:57:44,294
Whoever did this must pay.

960
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,963
Klod did it,
but I have to be the one who pays.

961
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,173
Just give it to me.

962
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:52,844
Hey, you guys.

963
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:57,056
You all look suspicious today.

964
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:59,851
-What's going on?
-Nothing.

965
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:01,311
Be careful about what you say.

966
00:58:01,769 --> 00:58:03,563
We are not gay.

967
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:06,691
I hate homosexuals.

968
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:09,152
Ton.

969
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,361
Well.

970
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:15,742
Don't tell me you guys
tried to do something here.

971
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,202
Don't let me find out.

972
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,370
So what?

973
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:21,080
Or do you like swing parties?

974
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,540
I can help.

975
00:58:22,624 --> 00:58:24,250
How about a threesome?

976
00:58:24,459 --> 00:58:25,418
Would you like that?

977
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,254
Are you okay?

978
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:31,424
-Take your hand off my butt now.
-Look at him.

979
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:34,302
You grabbed my butt.

980
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:37,805
You're insulting me,
an assistant team manager.

981
00:58:37,889 --> 00:58:38,723
He's right.

982
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:41,684
Jey! Just you wait.

983
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:44,979
I will squeeze your balls.

984
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:47,899
Stop! Don't do that!

985
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,485
-How was that?
-Well?

986
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:53,196
How do you feel?

987
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:55,198
My weapon.

988
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,117
-Vichakarn.
-What?

989
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,954
We shouldn't fight.

990
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:03,373
-Why do you guys have to fight?
-So?

991
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:06,626
-Vichakarn? Sit down.
-Yes.

992
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:08,920
-No one cares for me except you.
-Correct.

993
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,129
I love you.

994
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:12,423
-We can talk properly.
-Here.

995
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,884
Who hit me?

996
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:21,516
It was someone behind me. Who was it?
Who did it?

997
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,852
Who was brave enough
to hit me on the head?

998
00:59:24,936 --> 00:59:28,231
That hurt! Who did that?

999
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:30,191
He should die.

1000
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,359
Hey!

1001
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,069
-Stop! Just go, guys!
-Hey.

1002
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,488
-That's enough. We don't need him dead.
-Let's go.

1003
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,865
We need to cover this up.

1004
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,122
I bet you don't recognize me.

1005
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:47,625
Who was that?

1006
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,340
Let's go.

1007
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:58,678
-Quick. There's a CCTV here.
-Move the car.

1008
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:01,389
-Oh, no.
-Isn't it obvious?

1009
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:04,475
-They're also topless.
-They ran like mice.

1010
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:09,606
We have try-outs next week.
What should I do with you guys?

1011
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:12,984
Boss, it's obvious.

1012
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:16,029
I think you should fire them.

1013
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,906
I never give anyone a second chance.

1014
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:23,369
Unless that person shows me his potential.

1015
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,705
The three of you still have this chance.

1016
01:00:25,913 --> 01:00:28,082
An opportunity like this
doesn't come often,

1017
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:30,209
so do your best.

1018
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:21,844
Wow, Jey!

1019
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:27,058
I can't believe you guys
did such a great job!

1020
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:29,977
-Teach me sometime.
-Sure.

1021
01:01:31,979 --> 01:01:36,484
Unbelievable. What I taught you
were just the very basics.

1022
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,152
-Is that true?
-Sure thing.

1023
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,821
-Just the basics?
-Yes.

1024
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,948
-I forgot to tell you.
-What?

1025
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,076
-I only pressed the pedal during the race.
-Amazing.

1026
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:46,869
-I didn't even step on the gas.
-Really?

1027
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:50,331
When I checked it again,
the hand brake was still in my hand.

1028
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:53,835
Hey!

1029
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:56,754
You shouldn't brag before you win.

1030
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,381
Jey, your time isn't bad.

1031
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:01,050
I want you to be our substitute for now.

1032
01:02:01,676 --> 01:02:02,677
Yes.

1033
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,476
I'm so happy today.

1034
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:13,813
We all became race car drivers.

1035
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:17,942
I'm going to sing now.
There are a lot of songs available.

1036
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:20,653
For real? Don't lie, okay?

1037
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:22,864
Sure. I'm not lying.
Look, this is a new one.

1038
01:02:22,947 --> 01:02:24,073
This machine has it?

1039
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,878
Your dream finally came true!

1040
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:43,259
He's not a race car driver yet.
Only a substitute.

1041
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,929
Aren't we all substitutes, Mhee? Shut up.

1042
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,223
-He's right.
-Hear me out.

1043
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,600
Remember this.

1044
01:02:51,225 --> 01:02:53,144
The boss picked you

1045
01:02:53,227 --> 01:02:55,229
-because of your personality,
-Which is terrible.

1046
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,522
-skill,
-You don't have much.

1047
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:57,982
-experience,
-Very low.

1048
01:02:58,065 --> 01:02:59,358
-manner,
-Very uneducated.

1049
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:00,943
-and development.
-Slow like a traffic jam.

1050
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,487
-Just take the tollway then, idiot.
-What?

1051
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,821
You know everything, don't you?

1052
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:07,033
The boss isn't looking
for any of the things you just said.

1053
01:03:07,158 --> 01:03:08,784
If he's going to choose one racer,

1054
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:11,704
he must pick the best gentleman

1055
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:14,749
who is skilled and improves on his own.

1056
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:17,251
-Cheers to the new race car drivers!
-Cheers!

1057
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,253
Grilled pork for our victory.

1058
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:21,005
-We have waited for so long.
-That's right!

1059
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,423
-One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

1060
01:03:25,176 --> 01:03:26,511
-Wait.
-What?

1061
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:27,762
Where's mine?

1062
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,931
You ate too fast, Jey.

1063
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:33,643
I didn't eat too fast.
Who ate my damn pork?

1064
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,186
Whoever took the pork

1065
01:03:35,269 --> 01:03:36,562
-must be looking guilty.
-Yes.

1066
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,688
Why are you shaking?

1067
01:03:37,772 --> 01:03:39,607
-Your hands are shaking. Why?
-Choo, are you shaking?

1068
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,067
-It's so cold.
-"It's so cold."

1069
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,820
-It's so cold I can see your breath.
-"Cold" my ass.

1070
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:53,204
This is amazing.

1071
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:57,041
We can save a lot on wages this month.

1072
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,751
You're being stingy.

1073
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:03,089
Oh, I'm stingy?

1074
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:07,885
I have to save up for my daughter
who spends so much for love.

1075
01:04:08,386 --> 01:04:10,263
I'm not as mean as you, Mommy.

1076
01:04:13,975 --> 01:04:18,563
Here, pick one. A small one or a big one?

1077
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:23,860
I know why you put this pot
in front of Daddy's picture.

1078
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,028
Because there is a meaning, right?

1079
01:04:28,573 --> 01:04:32,326
This cactus has a meaning.

1080
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:34,662
"Toughness."

1081
01:04:35,871 --> 01:04:37,206
It doesn't need water.

1082
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,543
And the most important thing is,

1083
01:04:41,043 --> 01:04:47,466
it's perfect for a skinny
and stingy person like you, right, Mommy?

1084
01:04:48,926 --> 01:04:53,222
I wanted to tell you the meaning
of the cactus a long time ago.

1085
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:56,684
This is so stupid.
Like father, like daughter.

1086
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,769
Mommy.

1087
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,064
-Go.
-What are you doing here?

1088
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,444
You have to tell your son
to close this shop.

1089
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,530
My boss doesn't like anyone
getting in his way.

1090
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:15,077
My shop is legal.
You guys are breaking the law.

1091
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:18,873
-Would you like to die? Would you?
-Leave my parents alone.

1092
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:22,877
You have to tell your son
to close this shop.

1093
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:33,512
If you're going to drive like that,

1094
01:05:33,596 --> 01:05:35,556
you should take a vacation
and drive along the beach.

1095
01:05:35,681 --> 01:05:39,018
I lost 200 baht because of you.
You had better pay me back.

1096
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:41,312
I hate gambling.

1097
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:44,607
The reason I race
is because I love to drive.

1098
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,652
Is that so? That's too bad.

1099
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,987
Your dad was a legendary race car driver,

1100
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:52,031
but you're nothing like him.

1101
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:54,200
Be glad he's already dead.

1102
01:05:54,784 --> 01:05:59,163
Otherwise, he would have to hide his face
in shame for having a son like you.

1103
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:00,748
Why are you such a shitty person?

1104
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:03,459
Are you protecting him?
What is your relationship with him?

1105
01:06:04,168 --> 01:06:06,337
I don't like people who are all talk.

1106
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:07,588
Hey!

1107
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:10,216
You know what?

1108
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,551
Smart-asses like you
should be knocked down a peg or two.

1109
01:06:12,885 --> 01:06:14,220
-Hey! Don't pick a fight with me.
-Hey!

1110
01:06:14,303 --> 01:06:15,680
Hey!

1111
01:06:15,763 --> 01:06:17,014
Take it easy!

1112
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:20,434
Are you crazy, Klod?

1113
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:23,354
Can't you just keep it cool
when there's a problem like this?

1114
01:06:24,021 --> 01:06:28,651
If you're still aggressive,
then you can't be a driver.

1115
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:34,907
Choo, if Klod gets fired,

1116
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:36,951
they will have to find
another race car driver.

1117
01:06:37,076 --> 01:06:39,078
-Will they?
-Hey.

1118
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:43,207
Jey, what do you mean?

1119
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,793
I... worry about the team.

1120
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:47,586
-Why am I stuttering?
-You...

1121
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,255
Why are you stuttering like me?

1122
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:50,756
I'm so sorry, boss.

1123
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:55,010
I don't know why I acted like that.

1124
01:06:55,761 --> 01:06:58,014
-I'm so sick of the wealthy.
-Why?

1125
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,141
They have all the money,
but none of the emotions.

1126
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:01,392
Yes...

1127
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:03,894
Those... people,

1128
01:07:03,978 --> 01:07:06,814
they don't even have money
and they don't have feelings either.

1129
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:10,276
They have such foul mouths
and they never learn their lesson.

1130
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:13,821
Who's that?

1131
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:16,240
I don't know if you have noticed,

1132
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,200
but people like them tend to be loners.

1133
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,452
They don't have many friends.

1134
01:07:22,204 --> 01:07:23,456
I'm so glad I still have friends.

1135
01:07:29,503 --> 01:07:31,213
Do you know why you're in this team?

1136
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,132
What do you really want in life?

1137
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:41,390
Are you sick?

1138
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:43,726
You're always following people around.

1139
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,697
Klod is at the usual place.
Just meet him there.

1140
01:08:11,128 --> 01:08:14,673
-He's at--
-Klod, everyone is worried about you.

1141
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:17,426
Who would care about me?
No one is worried about me besides you.

1142
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:20,721
I know what happened to you.

1143
01:08:20,805 --> 01:08:23,307
I know that you're confused
and need to get things off your chest.

1144
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:27,645
Let it all out. Go ahead. Vent on me.

1145
01:08:27,728 --> 01:08:30,648
Do whatever you need to.
You might feel better.

1146
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:42,868
Crazy woman.

1147
01:08:43,202 --> 01:08:44,662
You always show up at the worst times.

1148
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:46,372
From now on,

1149
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:48,582
just stay away from me.

1150
01:08:57,258 --> 01:09:00,636
This song is for Kamhom.

1151
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,184
Ton asked me to sing this song for you.

1152
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:12,815
If you have a change of heart

1153
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:18,696
I would be sad for sure

1154
01:09:19,363 --> 01:09:22,658
But it won't be too long

1155
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:30,791
Before the pain fades away

1156
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:36,839
This pain will last

1157
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:41,677
This pain, I won't forget

1158
01:09:42,761 --> 01:09:45,931
This pain cuts me deeper

1159
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,350
-Will you forget this pain?
-"Will last."

1160
01:09:48,684 --> 01:09:49,852
No.

1161
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:52,438
You have to sing, "I won't forget."

1162
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,607
Those are the lyrics.

1163
01:09:57,776 --> 01:09:59,904
It hurts.

1164
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:02,948
It hurts more than you can understand.

1165
01:10:04,366 --> 01:10:07,411
It hurts more than ever.

1166
01:10:08,662 --> 01:10:10,164
More than anyone.

1167
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,626
More than anyone.

1168
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,544
You have no idea. You don't understand.

1169
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:17,087
I totally understand.

1170
01:10:19,924 --> 01:10:21,133
You don't understand.

1171
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:24,637
Because you have never loved anybody.

1172
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:27,598
You would not understand.

1173
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,601
Yes, I do.

1174
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:44,740
This pain will last

1175
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:49,954
This pain, I won't forget

1176
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,330
Now they're hugging.

1177
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:55,709
This pain cuts me deeper

1178
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,462
Damn it! Turn it off!

1179
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,467
Hey, Ton.

1180
01:11:04,218 --> 01:11:05,928
Why are you doing this?
Why are you hugging her?

1181
01:11:06,011 --> 01:11:08,055
Take your hands off her.

1182
01:11:08,389 --> 01:11:10,516
Kamhom, are you okay?

1183
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:13,727
I will take care of her.

1184
01:11:13,811 --> 01:11:15,312
Hey, you told me you would help me.

1185
01:11:15,437 --> 01:11:16,939
I can take care of her.

1186
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:20,985
But her mother asked me
to take care of her.

1187
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:26,490
And now she's drunk,
so I have to take care of her.

1188
01:11:27,741 --> 01:11:32,830
Jey, this is my only chance
to get close to Kamhom.

1189
01:11:35,207 --> 01:11:38,252
-You have to help me.
-You'll get a lot more chances,

1190
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:40,337
but not this one because she's drunk.

1191
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:44,425
Let go of Kamhom. Kamhom, come back here.

1192
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:50,097
-Jey, let me--
-Ton, you have to listen to me.

1193
01:11:51,515 --> 01:11:53,142
No. Stop crying.

1194
01:11:58,897 --> 01:11:59,815
Oh, shit.

1195
01:11:59,898 --> 01:12:01,400
All over my face... Wait.

1196
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:05,571
I need to puke too.

1197
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,198
Ton, hold her.

1198
01:12:13,746 --> 01:12:14,705
Hey.

1199
01:12:15,539 --> 01:12:16,957
My favorite shirt is dirty.

1200
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:21,378
My shirt!

1201
01:12:22,004 --> 01:12:23,255
What should I do?

1202
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:26,800
Kamhom.

1203
01:12:26,884 --> 01:12:29,303
Hey, Ton. Please watch her.
I will be right back.

1204
01:12:29,386 --> 01:12:30,679
I have to clean my shirt real quick.

1205
01:12:30,763 --> 01:12:36,018
-Jey, you can take my shirt.
-Hey! Don't do that, Kamhom.

1206
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:36,977
Are you out of your mind?

1207
01:12:37,061 --> 01:12:40,272
Hey, Ton, please take care of her.

1208
01:12:40,355 --> 01:12:42,524
I will be right back. Do you understand?

1209
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:43,859
You don't need to come back.

1210
01:12:43,942 --> 01:12:44,902
What?

1211
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,363
-Just hurry back here.
-Okay.

1212
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:17,226
You're tender like always

1213
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:23,774
You're taking care of me like always

1214
01:13:24,483 --> 01:13:29,696
Those eyes are familiar

1215
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:35,369
And I realize you're changing your mind

1216
01:13:36,787 --> 01:13:41,917
You may want to end things between us

1217
01:13:43,043 --> 01:13:49,341
Then be with your new man

1218
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:54,847
But you still pity me

1219
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:59,685
And don't be hard
On the one you used to love

1220
01:14:10,529 --> 01:14:17,035
The weaker I am for your tenderness

1221
01:14:17,286 --> 01:14:23,041
The longer it will hurt us

1222
01:14:23,167 --> 01:14:29,756
Please say goodbye if you fall out of love

1223
01:14:29,840 --> 01:14:35,596
And quit hurting my feelings

1224
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:41,935
Please tell me the bad news

1225
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:45,856
That you're getting rid of me

1226
01:14:46,064 --> 01:14:52,029
If you don't care, don't stay around

1227
01:14:52,279 --> 01:14:58,160
Just say it once and for all
Say goodbye and end things

1228
01:14:58,243 --> 01:15:05,083
You don't have to care even if it kills me

1229
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:11,465
Even if it kills me

1230
01:15:18,096 --> 01:15:22,893
Kamhom, Ton was so mad at Klod
that he dared him to race him.

1231
01:15:23,227 --> 01:15:24,770
I want you to be there.

1232
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:27,022
Hey, are you ready, Ton?

1233
01:15:31,276 --> 01:15:32,402
-Hey.
-What?

1234
01:15:32,486 --> 01:15:38,242
I think something is wrong
between those two.

1235
01:15:38,325 --> 01:15:42,537
It's pretty odd. Stop talking. Come here.

1236
01:15:51,755 --> 01:15:52,631
Oh, dear.

1237
01:15:59,096 --> 01:16:01,515
Whoever loses the race
has to stay away from Kamhom.

1238
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:09,022
Jey, why did you bring me here
to watch this?

1239
01:16:09,106 --> 01:16:10,565
Well, because...

1240
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:14,486
I don't really know.
It's ridiculous, don't you think?

1241
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:15,696
Are you ready?

1242
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:18,198
-One hundred percent.
-The finish line is where Jey is.

1243
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:24,997
If you have to choose,
which one will you choose?

1244
01:16:25,330 --> 01:16:27,874
Will you pick the winner or the loser?

1245
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:32,045
But if I were you,
I would pick someone who's not competing.

1246
01:16:32,504 --> 01:16:33,338
What?

1247
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:37,092
For real men like us,
off-track racing is perfect.

1248
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,479
I have to be their referee.
I was forced to. I have to go now.

1249
01:16:49,938 --> 01:16:52,024
Would you like to come with me?

1250
01:17:04,578 --> 01:17:05,787
-Peekaboo!
-Peekaboo!

1251
01:17:05,871 --> 01:17:07,664
Hey. What are you playing at?

1252
01:17:07,748 --> 01:17:10,000
Is that your scared look?

1253
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:20,510
The war over a girl begins.

1254
01:17:20,594 --> 01:17:24,389
-Are they fighting for this princess?
-Yes.

1255
01:17:24,514 --> 01:17:26,725
-Choo!
-I thought you would hit me on the head.

1256
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:33,565
Hey, referee!

1257
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:38,195
The racers are ready!
What are you waiting for?

1258
01:17:38,278 --> 01:17:39,363
Wait a minute.

1259
01:17:44,451 --> 01:17:46,286
What is he looking for?

1260
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:48,747
Look at him.
Why did he grab those napkins?

1261
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:51,041
-So he could blow his nose?
-"Blow his nose..." Hey!

1262
01:17:51,124 --> 01:17:53,543
-He's using them as flags.
-What flags?

1263
01:17:53,627 --> 01:17:55,128
There are no flags, so he's using napkins.

1264
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:58,048
-That's shabby. Hey!
-Just use them for now.

1265
01:17:58,131 --> 01:17:59,341
I have nothing else.

1266
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:01,718
Stop talking. Take a look.

1267
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:04,554
-How about you use your tooth as a flag?
-Are you nuts?

1268
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:16,441
Klod is here!

1269
01:18:19,653 --> 01:18:22,989
Faster, Klod!

1270
01:18:27,077 --> 01:18:31,415
Now Klod is at the finish line.

1271
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,085
Yes. That went exactly as planned.

1272
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:38,130
The beginning of a breakup.

1273
01:19:19,004 --> 01:19:20,547
Ton.

1274
01:19:23,049 --> 01:19:25,010
-I lost.
-No.

1275
01:19:26,178 --> 01:19:27,596
You're the winner.

1276
01:19:29,347 --> 01:19:31,850
Thank you for your kindness.

1277
01:19:32,225 --> 01:19:33,435
After hearing that,

1278
01:19:34,394 --> 01:19:37,230
now I really know
that we can only just be friends.

1279
01:19:37,355 --> 01:19:39,608
Listen to me.

1280
01:19:40,775 --> 01:19:43,195
You showed me

1281
01:19:43,695 --> 01:19:47,365
how fervent the efforts
of someone with a brave heart can be.

1282
01:19:49,117 --> 01:19:50,285
We can be friends, okay?

1283
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:00,462
Klod.

1284
01:20:01,838 --> 01:20:02,756
Klod!

1285
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:10,347
Klod! Just stop!

1286
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,392
What are you doing?

1287
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,561
This is so stupid.

1288
01:20:17,062 --> 01:20:18,814
What's going on between us,
it's all in your head.

1289
01:20:19,814 --> 01:20:20,941
Have you ever asked me about it?

1290
01:20:21,233 --> 01:20:22,734
Have you ever listened to me?

1291
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,656
How can you explain this?

1292
01:20:48,885 --> 01:20:49,928
Jey.

1293
01:20:50,804 --> 01:20:53,265
I would like you to tell Klod
that I'm sorry.

1294
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:58,770
I can now accept the truth

1295
01:20:59,354 --> 01:21:04,985
that Klod will never understand
the meaning of the flowers

1296
01:21:05,068 --> 01:21:10,782
I have been giving him.

1297
01:21:51,323 --> 01:21:52,657
Kamhom.

1298
01:21:58,538 --> 01:22:00,415
I have to confess something.

1299
01:22:04,419 --> 01:22:09,549
I want to tell you that I caused the fight

1300
01:22:13,553 --> 01:22:14,804
between Klod and Ton.

1301
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:24,230
But I did everything because...

1302
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,736
I'm sorry.

1303
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:36,034
Whatever happens, I want you
to be there at the race tomorrow.

1304
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:40,705
Please forgive me.

1305
01:22:57,263 --> 01:22:59,641
You showed me

1306
01:23:00,016 --> 01:23:03,812
how fervent the efforts
of someone with a brave heart can be.

1307
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:10,944
We can be friends, okay?

1308
01:23:22,205 --> 01:23:23,039
Ton.

1309
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,337
I don't want to talk.

1310
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,092
Ton, I'm sorry

1311
01:23:35,343 --> 01:23:36,678
for being such an idiot.

1312
01:23:38,513 --> 01:23:39,723
Your apology is not necessary.

1313
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,852
The only thing that you should do
is take care of Kamhom.

1314
01:23:45,311 --> 01:23:47,647
-Ton, but Jey...
-I know.

1315
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:55,113
Hey.

1316
01:24:02,912 --> 01:24:03,997
I'm sorry.

1317
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:12,172
A real man like me

1318
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,549
will always forgive you.

1319
01:24:15,967 --> 01:24:17,177
I totally understand.

1320
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:20,013
The heart can't be forced.

1321
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,015
But you...

1322
01:24:23,224 --> 01:24:24,809
punched me pretty hard.

1323
01:24:54,589 --> 01:24:59,302
The Singha Racing Team is proud
to introduce our newest driver. Not you.

1324
01:24:59,844 --> 01:25:03,556
-It's Jey!
-Jey! Yes!

1325
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:06,559
-Hey, where is he going?
-Jey!

1326
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:08,978
Why didn't you walk this way?

1327
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:11,773
-Look at him.
-Hey.

1328
01:25:15,068 --> 01:25:18,363
A real racer doesn't race off the track.

1329
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:23,076
-I can win everything by myself.
-Amazing.

1330
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,415
You're the man, Jey!

1331
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,503
You won this match
even before it had begun.

1332
01:25:33,586 --> 01:25:34,462
Not at all.

1333
01:25:34,587 --> 01:25:36,506
-Not because of your skill...
-What?

1334
01:25:37,006 --> 01:25:38,383
but because of your heart.

1335
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:43,847
-That was so cool.
-So we three have to win today.

1336
01:25:43,930 --> 01:25:46,307
-What? Three people?
-What?

1337
01:25:46,599 --> 01:25:49,435
Then that means
you will let me race today?

1338
01:25:50,019 --> 01:25:50,854
Yes.

1339
01:25:51,437 --> 01:25:53,022
-Really?
-What?

1340
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:54,357
You're not kidding, right?

1341
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:58,069
-Yes!
-Jey! Klod!

1342
01:25:59,946 --> 01:26:02,157
Quit it already!

1343
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:05,410
Listen to me.

1344
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:11,791
-Please get ready for the race now.
-Yes. Go.

1345
01:26:13,126 --> 01:26:17,297
-Go right ahead.
-Go.

1346
01:26:17,380 --> 01:26:19,465
What are you saying?

1347
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:22,010
-They already left?
-Yes.

1348
01:26:22,093 --> 01:26:23,428
-Go. Just go.
-Stammering like this...

1349
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:24,596
I don't want to talk to you.

1350
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:26,055
-Go!
-I want to tell you...

1351
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:28,892
-There's no need to. Just go.
-But...

1352
01:26:28,975 --> 01:26:30,435
What is it?

1353
01:26:35,148 --> 01:26:36,274
I'm sorry.

1354
01:26:45,116 --> 01:26:49,495
I have been cruel to you,

1355
01:26:50,747 --> 01:26:52,373
even though you have always cared for me.

1356
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:55,710
From now on,
you don't have to follow me around.

1357
01:26:56,628 --> 01:26:57,921
I will take care of you.

1358
01:27:07,805 --> 01:27:11,059
Welcome back to the Thailand
Super Cars Championship 2011.

1359
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:14,062
There are 20 race cars in the race.

1360
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:17,565
Today's race is very intense.

1361
01:27:17,690 --> 01:27:20,193
And above all, today is the debut

1362
01:27:20,318 --> 01:27:22,904
of three newcomers
from the Singha Racing School,

1363
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:25,615
Jey, Klod, and Ton.

1364
01:27:25,740 --> 01:27:28,993
These three used to race in club races

1365
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:33,414
before they got in the Thailand
Super Cars Championship this year.

1366
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:45,218
Now I think everyone
is ready to watch the race.

1367
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:48,972
One minute until the race begins.

1368
01:27:49,055 --> 01:27:50,515
I'm going to win.

1369
01:27:57,271 --> 01:27:59,565
All the drivers are ready.
And the lights are off!

1370
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:04,153
The race has begun for the Thailand
Super Cars Championship 2011.

1371
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:07,740
Car number 44 had a good start,

1372
01:28:07,865 --> 01:28:09,909
getting to first place beautifully.

1373
01:28:09,993 --> 01:28:11,995
He's taking the first spot.

1374
01:28:14,247 --> 01:28:20,253
Oh, Klod from Singha Racing School
is coming up to the lead.

1375
01:28:20,586 --> 01:28:25,508
Jey is trying to get ahead of another car.

1376
01:28:26,259 --> 01:28:29,262
And now he is in third place,
with Ton in second place

1377
01:28:30,763 --> 01:28:33,891
and Klod in first place.

1378
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:38,104
If he can hold that position to the end,
he is going to be the champion for sure.

1379
01:28:38,229 --> 01:28:40,273
Is he going for it?

1380
01:28:41,566 --> 01:28:44,902
He is still leading this race.

1381
01:28:45,111 --> 01:28:47,530
Go, Klod.

1382
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:50,116
Klod, you can do this!

1383
01:28:50,324 --> 01:28:52,618
Oh, there it is. What happened?

1384
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:55,913
Klod's car is off the track
and the crowd is really disappointed.

1385
01:28:55,997 --> 01:28:58,291
Now the crowd in this stadium is bored.

1386
01:28:58,374 --> 01:29:03,129
So that makes Jey the leader,
with Ton in second place.

1387
01:29:07,592 --> 01:29:09,594
The crowd is cheering.

1388
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:15,767
Ton is racing for first place,
and Jey can tell.

1389
01:29:15,933 --> 01:29:20,605
There are just a few laps left now.

1390
01:29:20,688 --> 01:29:23,900
This is the last corner in the Thailand
Super Cars Championship 2011.

1391
01:29:23,983 --> 01:29:27,445
He is going into the straight part soon.

1392
01:29:28,321 --> 01:29:29,781
Ton is still coming along the left side.

1393
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:31,574
Can he make it? Yes, he can!

1394
01:29:31,657 --> 01:29:34,535
He's in first place now
and Jey is in second place.

1395
01:29:34,619 --> 01:29:37,872
Those two racers
from Singha Racing School are awesome.

1396
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:49,300
I lost.

1397
01:29:51,469 --> 01:29:53,012
I lost.

1398
01:29:54,597 --> 01:29:56,140
No one is a loser.

1399
01:29:58,643 --> 01:29:59,852
There are only winners.

1400
01:30:05,608 --> 01:30:08,653
In every race, everyone is a winner.

1401
01:30:08,903 --> 01:30:11,280
And you're a winner too.

1402
01:30:12,949 --> 01:30:13,950
All right.

1403
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,244
She's cute.

1404
01:30:23,543 --> 01:30:27,463
Excuse me, but are you flirting with me?

1405
01:30:30,341 --> 01:30:33,010
I really admire you.

1406
01:30:34,011 --> 01:30:35,847
You're so handsome.

1407
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:38,850
Pointing at my heart too.

1408
01:30:42,645 --> 01:30:46,482
Sorry for being direct,
but do you have a boyfriend?

1409
01:30:51,696 --> 01:30:53,239
No answer means she really likes me.

1410
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:58,536
I want to ask you a direct question.

1411
01:30:59,036 --> 01:31:00,329
Do you want to be my girlfriend?

1412
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:06,043
No answer means "yes."

1413
01:31:15,344 --> 01:31:18,181
Jey, I forgot to introduce you.

1414
01:31:18,264 --> 01:31:19,348
This is my girlfriend.

1415
01:31:19,432 --> 01:31:21,309
Here she is.
Jey, have you met my girlfriend?

1416
01:31:21,434 --> 01:31:23,644
He's the one I told you about. He's...

1417
01:31:23,728 --> 01:31:25,688
-Hello.
-Hello.

1418
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:29,358
Ton, you jerk.

1419
01:31:30,985 --> 01:31:33,863
You already know him, right?
He's my brother.

1420
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:34,947
-Jey.
-Hey.

1421
01:31:35,698 --> 01:31:38,117
We will be your love consultants.

1422
01:31:38,618 --> 01:31:40,912
-You two are working as a team?
-Yes.

1423
01:31:40,995 --> 01:31:42,872
-Were you trying to fool me?
-Yes.

1424
01:31:42,955 --> 01:31:46,167
Is it fun to play with someone's heart?

1425
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,835
You two are not related.

1426
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:49,962
If I can't kill you two today,
don't call me a real man.

1427
01:31:50,338 --> 01:31:52,924
-An elephant is coming after us!
-Jey!

1428
01:31:53,007 --> 01:31:55,968
Run away! Run!

1429
01:31:56,093 --> 01:31:57,720
-Catch me if you can!
-You bastards!

1430
01:31:59,805 --> 01:32:03,809
-Be careful! Hey!
-Hey, wait for me, Ton, Klod!

1431
01:32:04,310 --> 01:32:09,065
How can I find a wife
if my legs are like this?

1432
01:32:09,398 --> 01:32:11,484
Wait for me! Klod, Ton!

1433
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:18,241
Damn your long legs! Come pick me up!

1434
01:32:49,522 --> 01:32:51,983
Hey! Jey!

1435
01:32:52,066 --> 01:32:53,943
What a reckless driver!

1436
01:32:55,111 --> 01:32:56,028
Step on the brake!

1437
01:33:06,247 --> 01:33:09,250
Hey! Are you a policeman or a slingshot?
You're way too fast.

1438
01:33:10,209 --> 01:33:11,836
Dad, you're the best!
You won the trophy again!

1439
01:33:11,919 --> 01:33:13,671
-Here's the trophy...
-Amazing!

1440
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:15,423
and the olive wreath.

1441
01:33:16,465 --> 01:33:18,592
Dad, one day,
I'll become a great racer like you.

1442
01:33:18,676 --> 01:33:19,969
Please always be there for me.

1443
01:33:20,052 --> 01:33:22,305
-I believe you can do it.
-Yes, Dad.

1444
01:33:42,408 --> 01:33:43,534
Kick!

1445
01:33:50,374 --> 01:33:51,751
You!

1446
01:33:52,752 --> 01:33:54,587
What are you trying to do?

1447
01:33:56,297 --> 01:33:58,424
Don't! Can't you see my leg cast?

1448
01:33:58,507 --> 01:34:02,511
God! Give me back my crutch!

1449
01:34:02,595 --> 01:34:04,972
-Let's go.
-Why me?

1450
01:34:13,105 --> 01:34:16,192
Scene 87. Cut 1. Take 3.
End slate. Camera AB.

1451
01:34:16,275 --> 01:34:17,318
Where's the microphone?

1452
01:34:18,944 --> 01:34:20,696
That's a wrap!
