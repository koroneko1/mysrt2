1
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:31,125
[Pong] My dad told me Rajabodin School
is the most prestigious

2
00:00:31,208 --> 00:00:33,625
boarding school in the province.

3
00:00:33,708 --> 00:00:36,791
This school is different in that

4
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:40,375
it emphasizes extracurricular activities.

5
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,833
The founder believed that

6
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:47,791
activities allowed students
to gain experience.

7
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,000
YEAR 1947
FOUNDER OF SCIENCE CLUB

8
00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:51,083
We get to see what we like or excel at.

9
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:52,041
YEAR 1946
FOUNDER OF SOCCER CLUB

10
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,208
YEAR 1995
FOUNDER OF COVER DANCE CLUB

11
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,375
STUDENT CLUBS

12
00:00:58,916 --> 00:01:01,041
[girl] Photo club is here.

13
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,166
It's photo club.

14
00:01:05,416 --> 00:01:06,500
Hey, you.

15
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:09,291
[cheering]

16
00:01:12,916 --> 00:01:15,250
[Pong] Soccer club is the most famous.

17
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:18,541
It's held the championship title
for ten years in a row.

18
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:20,666
Why is it so crowded?

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,166
[Pong] But the newest and most popular

20
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,375
would be this cupcake club.

21
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:32,500
The hottest imaginary couple in school

22
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:34,500
is the president of both clubs.

23
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,125
[all screaming]

24
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,458
Book is the soccer club's captain
that everybody loves.

25
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:51,666
My cupcake

26
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:55,375
is pretty, delicious, and perfect.

27
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,708
I'm giving it to you, Book.

28
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:01,583
[Pong] As for Eve, everybody respects her.

29
00:02:01,666 --> 00:02:06,125
Everybody knows that Book belongs to Eve
because a prince belongs to a princess.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,875
Isn't that right?

31
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:11,208
[Eve] Hello, everyone.

32
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,208
Today, Book and I,

33
00:02:13,375 --> 00:02:15,125
in the name of the club presidents,

34
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,333
came here to welcome you guys.

35
00:02:17,416 --> 00:02:19,333
[Pik] Book!

36
00:02:19,916 --> 00:02:21,583
Book!

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,208
Book, here.

38
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:26,875
Hi, everyone.

39
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:29,708
I'd like you all

40
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:32,416
to explore and get to know each club

41
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,833
since you have to stay in it

42
00:02:34,916 --> 00:02:36,333
for at least a semester.

43
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,291
[Eve] And I'd like to recommend my club,

44
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,041
the cupcake club.

45
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,166
[students applauding]

46
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,250
My club focuses on neatness,

47
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,375
delicacy, beauty,

48
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,541
carefulness,

49
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,791
and good manners.

50
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:58,500
Huh!

51
00:03:00,458 --> 00:03:04,500
I'd like all of you to participate in
every club's activities.

52
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:05,833
And I hope

53
00:03:05,916 --> 00:03:07,750
I could be of some help.

54
00:03:07,833 --> 00:03:10,500
If anyone has a problem,

55
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,833
we are both glad to help you.

56
00:03:17,791 --> 00:03:18,625
[whistle blows]

57
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:22,750
Whose ball is this? Hey, whose ball?

58
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,916
Whose ball?

59
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:32,166
Whose ball? Admit it! Is it yours?

60
00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:34,833
Yours?

61
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,708
Don't know?

62
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,208
Shh!

63
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:13,166
180, Montri. 189, Somjit.

64
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:15,125
Come on.

65
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:17,083
Ready?

66
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,291
[whistle blows]

67
00:04:21,458 --> 00:04:24,875
Hey, hey, hey! No! Shit.

68
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:28,250
[scoffs]

69
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,083
You're gonna hit on
that pink ball's owner, right?

70
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,333
Not a chance.

71
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,833
How come?

72
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,083
Because of this.

73
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,166
You surely can't handle her.

74
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,958
She isn't a tomboy,
but a school mean girl.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,541
Hey! Why did you do that?

76
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:53,833
Hit her classmates.

77
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,541
Kicked a ball into a parent's face.

78
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:01,500
Finally, she kicked a ball into her coach
and got expelled.

79
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,083
So she came here
because of her mom's connections.

80
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,625
Don't pay attention.

81
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,041
How could I not?

82
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,541
She's all over Facebook.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,083
Here.

84
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,666
She's quite cute.

85
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,791
But you should leave her alone
because of her character.

86
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,208
[Pik] What character?

87
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:27,875
Hey, nice shoes!

88
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:33,250
We do have many things in common, huh?

89
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:42,916
[whispering] He's doomed.

90
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,250
[Pik] Whoo!

91
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,000
Today, we've tried out for new members.

92
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,208
The first one is 190, Baworn.

93
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:24,958
-Give him a big hand.
-[all applauding]

94
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:28,875
Next, 198, Dome.

95
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:30,416
Yes!

96
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,166
Very good, Dome.

97
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,208
Okay, okay.

98
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:35,250
Next, 199, Pok Pong.

99
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,166
-Great.
-[Coach Ble] You made it.

100
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:42,583
Give them a round of applause.

101
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,666
Three people passed this round.
You three go meet at the club room.

102
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,333
Dismissed.

103
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,000
Wait, Coach.

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,333
Did I not make it?

105
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,000
[blows whistle]

106
00:06:58,083 --> 00:07:00,750
-Okay, everyone, dismissed!
-Hey! How come he made it?

107
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:02,666
-It's not fair!
-Pik.

108
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,708
Come on. I'll take you to another club.

109
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:07,666
Pik.

110
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:09,583
Hey!

111
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:13,250
[Pik] Let me go.

112
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:18,125
I won't be in her crazy club!

113
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,666
I hate her.

114
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,458
And I don't want to make cupcakes.

115
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,375
Pik.

116
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,791
This club is not easy to get into.

117
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,708
I begged Eve so you could get in.

118
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,083
She wasn't even resentful
for this morning.

119
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:37,958
Hey.

120
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,750
Are you on her side?

121
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:46,875
Pik.

122
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,416
This school emphasizes
extracurricular activities.

123
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,916
And you got into a fight.

124
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,750
You could get expelled.

125
00:08:02,208 --> 00:08:03,375
How about this?

126
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:07,583
You join it for this semester.

127
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,291
Okay?

128
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,916
Hey, you hear me?

129
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:14,458
[Pik] Yeah.

130
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:43,208
KEEP OUT
UNDER MAINTENANCE

131
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,208
Hi, Dad.

132
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:55,166
[Piya Pong on phone] Hey, how are you
doing, kiddo? How was the tryout?

133
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:58,125
-I made it on the team.
-So why didn't you call me?

134
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,375
How are your new friends?

135
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:01,625
They're good.

136
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,875
Great.

137
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:04,791
[Piya Pong] Glad to hear that.

138
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,541
Hey, call me often, okay?

139
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay.

140
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,708
You came here to practice?

141
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,583
Me, too.

142
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,458
Care to join?

143
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,500
No. I just want to work out.

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,125
Practicing alone

145
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,375
is no fun.

146
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,375
I can train you.

147
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,458
No, thank you.

148
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:03,916
What's the matter with you?

149
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,083
I see.

150
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,375
You're upset about the rumor in the club.

151
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,500
You're so sensitive.

152
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:18,250
Why do you care about them?

153
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:32,500
Sucker!

154
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,708
But if you're good
and don't care about anybody,

155
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:42,833
nobody likes you, either.

156
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,000
GRADE 7 ROOM 1

157
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:50,916
[bell ringing]

158
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,875
Did you see the tryouts yesterday?
The player sucked!

159
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:56,083
The coach...

160
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,125
He must have bribed the coach.

161
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:01,625
Terrible passing and play. I knew it.

162
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:04,333
[chattering]

163
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,458
We should respect Coach Ble's decision.

164
00:11:08,541 --> 00:11:09,708
But, sir,

165
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:13,125
school rules do not prohibit women
to be in the soccer club.

166
00:11:13,208 --> 00:11:15,375
But they also say

167
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:19,458
we should respect the decisions
made by the club counselor.

168
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,750
Don't you think it's discrimination?

169
00:11:22,833 --> 00:11:26,041
So you decided to kick the ball
into the coach

170
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:29,333
the same way you did

00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,250
All of you at that table just move
to the other tables.

340
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,000
-[girl 1] Okay.
-[girl 2] Good.

341
00:27:12,416 --> 00:27:14,833
[Mrs. Bright] Let's go. Come on.

342
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,958
From today on,

343
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:23,375
I'll have Eve be by your side
until you know how to make a cupcake.

344
00:27:25,416 --> 00:27:28,708
Mrs. Bright, are you sure it's a good idea
to have Eve...

345
00:27:28,791 --> 00:27:32,583
[Mrs. Bright] I'm sure that Eve
can catch you up with everyone.

346
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:36,250
Eve, are you also willing
to train her overtime?

347
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:46,083
For our cupcake club,

348
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,750
I'd be happy to.

349
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:52,041
Very good.

350
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:53,958
Go there now, then.

351
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:55,791
Go. Come on.

352
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,208
Chop-chop.

353
00:27:58,291 --> 00:28:00,416
Today, we're gonna learn
how to crack eggs.

354
00:28:00,916 --> 00:28:02,083
Good.

355
00:28:05,791 --> 00:28:07,041
I think it's good.

356
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,416
Keep the enemy close,

357
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,250
so she won't be near Book.

358
00:28:10,333 --> 00:28:12,166
[Mrs. Bright] Grab an egg, everyone.

359
00:28:14,166 --> 00:28:15,500
[Eve] Grab an egg.

360
00:28:17,541 --> 00:28:18,875
Wider side is down.

361
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:20,541
Narrower side is up.

362
00:28:23,750 --> 00:28:24,791
Then crack it.

363
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:32,833
Useless.

364
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,958
Couldn't even crack an egg.

365
00:28:35,083 --> 00:28:36,875
You just ruined it.

366
00:28:37,833 --> 00:28:40,458
Look. Crack it just once.

367
00:28:40,875 --> 00:28:42,125
Then open it.

368
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:46,166
And normally, a beautiful,
well-mannered girl

369
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,250
would keep the egg shell like this.

370
00:28:48,833 --> 00:28:50,083
Today,

371
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,166
we're gonna play as a team.

372
00:28:52,333 --> 00:28:53,875
The non-freshmen in one team.

373
00:28:54,291 --> 00:28:55,958
The freshmen in another.

374
00:28:56,375 --> 00:29:00,250
To test your skills and potential.
To see who are superior.

375
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:02,000
Ready? Get in position.

376
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:02,916
[blows whistle]

377
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:05,000
Go, go.

378
00:29:14,583 --> 00:29:16,541
Take it. Good.

379
00:29:23,958 --> 00:29:25,083
Good.

380
00:29:27,916 --> 00:29:30,166
Book, I scored a goal!

381
00:29:30,666 --> 00:29:31,791
Hey.

382
00:30:11,208 --> 00:30:12,875
I'm sure it's the sprinkles.

383
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:16,583
Evil Eve asked me to get it
from the cupboard the other day.

384
00:30:16,791 --> 00:30:17,916
And...

385
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,250
But I randomly picked it.

386
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,833
So I don't know which one.

387
00:30:23,291 --> 00:30:24,666
As you have seen,

388
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:26,666
there are 38 bottles of them.

389
00:30:30,458 --> 00:30:32,041
But don't be hopeless just yet.

390
00:30:32,458 --> 00:30:33,958
Let's try until we find it.

391
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,791
Let's do this.

392
00:30:46,208 --> 00:30:48,333
While we're looking the switching formula,

393
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:50,250
I'll train you in soccer,

394
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:53,333
since we have to try making cupcakes
together anyway.

395
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,166
It's a way to say thank you.

396
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,583
Once we switch back, you'll be ready

397
00:30:58,916 --> 00:31:00,333
and as good as me.

398
00:31:06,708 --> 00:31:10,916
If so, we have to practice every day.

399
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,625
Sure.

400
00:31:17,666 --> 00:31:21,500
And you have to promise me

401
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,000
that you will make the lineup.

402
00:31:26,625 --> 00:31:27,583
I promise.

403
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,750
So let's start from this one.

404
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:35,500
You send your dad
the clip of me playing this afternoon.

405
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:37,458
Come on.

406
00:31:39,250 --> 00:31:40,541
Your dad would be proud.

407
00:31:43,833 --> 00:31:44,916
Here.

408
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,458
Send it.

409
00:32:05,875 --> 00:32:07,833
Now, we're gonna switch some positions.

410
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:10,333
Pong and Dome,
go to the non-freshmen team.

411
00:32:10,416 --> 00:32:12,041
Gug and Tony,

412
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,333
go to the freshmen team.

413
00:32:16,958 --> 00:32:17,791
[whistle blows]

414
00:32:24,666 --> 00:32:26,083
Pong, pass it to me.

415
00:32:26,583 --> 00:32:27,750
Hey!

416
00:32:29,208 --> 00:32:31,833
[boy] Book, shoot it!

417
00:32:33,666 --> 00:32:34,833
Yes!

418
00:32:35,083 --> 00:32:36,250
Book!

419
00:32:36,375 --> 00:32:37,666
That was great.

420
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:43,375
I'll get to see Pik's cupcake
today, right?

421
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,458
Of course, Mrs. Bright.

422
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,333
Looking good.

423
00:32:58,625 --> 00:33:01,166
Eve, you trained her so well.

424
00:33:02,958 --> 00:33:04,333
Keep trying, okay?

425
00:33:15,166 --> 00:33:16,375
Two.

426
00:33:16,708 --> 00:33:18,375
Three.

427
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,541
Four.

428
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,958
Anyway,

429
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,375
we are

430
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,708
in sync on the field.

431
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:31,791
Speaking of which, I think
you play like a girl I know.

432
00:33:32,708 --> 00:33:33,875
Well,

433
00:33:34,916 --> 00:33:37,791
I'd like to be your bro.

434
00:33:41,166 --> 00:33:42,375
Get back to counting.

435
00:33:44,375 --> 00:33:45,708
Where was I?

436
00:33:47,083 --> 00:33:48,833
-Seven, maybe?
-Seven.

437
00:33:51,375 --> 00:33:52,666
Seven.

438
00:34:08,458 --> 00:34:10,916
Hold it like this. Okay. Begin.

439
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,416
Push it. Slowly.

440
00:34:15,041 --> 00:34:16,541
Slowly.

441
00:34:16,708 --> 00:34:18,666
Till the end. Push it.

442
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:19,875
Then pull it up.

443
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:23,250
Pik, you're just frosting a cake.

444
00:34:24,708 --> 00:34:26,166
Why are you so excited?

445
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:34,666
This is not it.

446
00:34:37,708 --> 00:34:41,166
Here. Your cupcake looks
and tastes better.

447
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:43,916
Eve taught me.

448
00:34:47,875 --> 00:34:49,083
I'm full now.

449
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:52,083
[sighs]

450
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,250
By the way,

451
00:34:54,625 --> 00:34:58,208
I might get to play in the Jaturamitr Cup
this Saturday.

452
00:34:58,958 --> 00:35:01,166
Wow, are you joking?

453
00:35:01,541 --> 00:35:02,833
I'm serious.

454
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:06,000
Coach let me play
as a midfielder recently.

455
00:35:09,791 --> 00:35:10,625
[cheering]

456
00:35:11,625 --> 00:35:15,416
[Satit] Welcome to the Jaturamitr Cup
Championship Game,

457
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,791
which consists of the top four
schools in Thailand

458
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:22,750
competing with each other.

459
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,250
For today,

460
00:35:24,333 --> 00:35:27,458
We're "Ja" Satit Krikul
and "Borboo" Bouranij Rattanavichien.

461
00:35:27,541 --> 00:35:28,833
We're the announcers.

462
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:32,458
Yes. Today is a match
between the Blue Whales

463
00:35:32,541 --> 00:35:35,000
of Rajabodin School,
the defending champions.

464
00:35:35,208 --> 00:35:38,458
They will play against the Golden Bus
of Ponsririn School.

465
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:42,125
This "Golden Bus" nickname says something
about how they play

466
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,541
and their style, obviously.

467
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:48,041
[Satit] The game between Rajabodin
and Ponsririn is about to start.

468
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,083
I noticed earlier that

469
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:55,916
Coach Jay, Ponsririn's coach, walked over,
but Coach Ble wouldn't shake his hand.

470
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,250
So I think the fun
won't just be on the field.

471
00:35:59,458 --> 00:36:01,458
There's something going on outside, too.

472
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:05,125
Rajabodin's coach would not have a truce.

473
00:36:05,291 --> 00:36:08,166
The game between Rajabodin
and Ponsririn is starting now.

474
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,500
Ponsririn gets to kick off.

475
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:14,166
[Bouranij] They are in yellow shirts.

476
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,791
Polsirrin meet
the defending champion, Rajabodin,

477
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:22,208
who are superior in terms of play style
and dignity. But at this moment,

478
00:36:22,375 --> 00:36:24,541
Ponsririn get the ball
through to the right,

479
00:36:24,625 --> 00:36:27,250
reaching the back line.
Send it across to the center.

480
00:36:27,333 --> 00:36:30,666
Too slow. Shoot and a miss.

481
00:36:31,375 --> 00:36:32,750
[cheerleaders chanting]

482
00:36:34,875 --> 00:36:37,375
Now, Rajabodin get a chance to attack

483
00:36:37,458 --> 00:36:38,416
for the first time.

484
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,083
There's someone on the right,

485
00:36:41,166 --> 00:36:43,583
someone on the left. He's going alone.

486
00:36:44,125 --> 00:36:45,583
[boy] Tum, pass it back here.

487
00:36:47,875 --> 00:36:49,666
Pass it here!

488
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,458
So far, the game is tight.

489
00:37:01,541 --> 00:37:04,666
But as you can see, Rajabodin's number 16,

490
00:37:04,750 --> 00:37:07,416
Chatchawan Tamsri, can barely walk

491
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,250
and is limping.
He's about to be substituted.

492
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,750
And number 15 coming in

493
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,333
is Pok Pong.

494
00:37:25,416 --> 00:37:28,541
Wait a minute. His last name
sounds familiar.

495
00:37:28,625 --> 00:37:30,458
It is the same last name as

496
00:37:30,541 --> 00:37:33,375
a former forward legend
of the national Thai soccer team.

497
00:37:33,458 --> 00:37:35,916
[Satit] Long-time soccer fans
must know this name,

498
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,291
-"Tuk" Piya Pong Pue-on.
-[Bouranij] Let's see in his play

499
00:37:40,708 --> 00:37:43,583
if he's related to Piya Pong or just
has the same name.

[all cheering]

504
00:38:34,666 --> 00:38:36,166
[Eve] You were awesome, Book!

505
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,333
Tired?

506
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,416
I've played as I promised.

507
00:38:59,208 --> 00:39:00,291
Was it a fluke?

508
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:04,250
No way! This was all me.

509
00:39:07,375 --> 00:39:09,583
I look so cool right now.

510
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,375
You are very good.

511
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:16,500
When did those two become so close?

512
00:39:16,625 --> 00:39:18,458
[Pong] Come on. Let's take a selfie.

513
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,125
Thank you so much, Pong.

514
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,208
Hey,

515
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,583
do you want me to tell your dad

516
00:39:53,666 --> 00:39:57,041
that, after the game, you don't want
to be in soccer club anymore.

517
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:59,750
No, no.

518
00:40:01,083 --> 00:40:02,125
Don't say anything.

519
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,166
Okay. It's up to you.

520
00:40:06,416 --> 00:40:07,708
Be good.

521
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,791
Hi, Dad.

522
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,833
Hello.

523
00:40:20,041 --> 00:40:21,375
How did you get here?

524
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,416
I asked the coach for permission.

525
00:40:24,666 --> 00:40:27,750
Dad, this is Pik.

526
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:34,666
Here is the clip of the game
that I was in.

527
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:37,500
Look. See? I came around with the ball,

528
00:40:37,583 --> 00:40:39,458
passing the first person, the second,

529
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,500
then the third. Was I cool, Dad?

530
00:40:42,708 --> 00:40:44,916
What a bragger you are!

531
00:40:45,666 --> 00:40:46,708
Hmm?

532
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:48,666
You appear so introverted,

533
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,541
but you brought a girl here, too.

534
00:40:50,625 --> 00:40:53,416
It's not like that. We're just friends.

535
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,875
Hey!

536
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:56,541
Don't be shy, Pik.

537
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:00,208
Dad, these days,

538
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,041
girls like guys with cute little faces.

539
00:41:03,125 --> 00:41:06,000
And guys like strong girls.

540
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:22,375
Normally, he's not lazy like this.

541
00:41:22,750 --> 00:41:25,666
He must be really tired today.

542
00:41:26,541 --> 00:41:27,708
Let me help you.

543
00:41:39,916 --> 00:41:41,083
Dad, you...

544
00:41:43,291 --> 00:41:45,875
-I mean, you bake?
-Sure!

545
00:41:46,791 --> 00:41:48,291
What you just ate,

546
00:41:49,208 --> 00:41:50,750
I made that myself.

547
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:54,000
Since Pong is in boarding school,

548
00:41:54,666 --> 00:41:56,000
I have some free time.

549
00:41:56,625 --> 00:41:59,375
While I was free,
I just cleaned up the house.

550
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:01,583
And I found this.

551
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:04,083
His mom's baking set.

552
00:42:04,666 --> 00:42:05,916
So I tried it out.

553
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,541
I can bake, too.

554
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,083
I'm in the cupcake club at school.

555
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:14,916
Really? I thought you were
in the same club.

556
00:42:15,833 --> 00:42:19,291
Pong can do well when he's doing it
with the one he loves.

557
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:22,958
When he was younger,
he liked to bake with his mom.

558
00:42:23,291 --> 00:42:24,916
As for soccer,

559
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:27,916
he started to play after his mom died,

560
00:42:28,583 --> 00:42:31,791
and I quit the national soccer club

561
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:34,000
so I could take care of him full-time.

562
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:39,666
I thought

563
00:42:40,583 --> 00:42:42,458
you wanted him to be a soccer player.

564
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:47,416
It's probably because when he was little

565
00:42:48,083 --> 00:42:51,583
I liked to tell him about soccer.

566
00:42:52,333 --> 00:42:54,250
So he probably assumed

567
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:56,833
that I wanted him to be a soccer player.

568
00:42:57,958 --> 00:42:59,333
But, actually,

569
00:42:59,916 --> 00:43:01,833
being a soccer player has a plus side.

570
00:43:08,666 --> 00:43:09,750
So...

571
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,750
if he quits soccer

572
00:43:14,750 --> 00:43:16,541
and doesn't know yet what he wants,

573
00:43:18,958 --> 00:43:20,541
will you be mad?

574
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,625
Mad about what?

575
00:43:26,083 --> 00:43:29,666
He's my son no matter what.

576
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,166
You're so sensitive, huh?

577
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:01,416
[Pik] You told your dad

578
00:44:01,708 --> 00:44:03,041
about quitting soccer?

579
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:04,916
[Pong] Yeah.

580
00:44:05,833 --> 00:44:09,083
With your body, I have the courage.

581
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,333
Thank you, Pik.

582
00:44:33,916 --> 00:44:35,666
Your chest is really flat.

583
00:44:36,416 --> 00:44:37,833
Not very comfortable.

584
00:44:45,875 --> 00:44:46,708
[chuckles]

585
00:45:20,458 --> 00:45:21,916
Oh, shit.

586
00:45:22,375 --> 00:45:24,125
You'll be trapped by Pik.

587
00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,333
[all exclaiming]

588
00:45:38,583 --> 00:45:41,166
[Dew] You're quite popular now.

589
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:50,375
Don't you have to bring
the cupcake to Pong?

590
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:52,708
Later.

591
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:55,125
Why did you come by here?

592
00:45:56,083 --> 00:46:00,125
About the trip this weekend,

593
00:46:00,833 --> 00:46:01,916
what would you say?

594
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:06,666
Wait. I told you that I have to go home,
didn't I?

595
00:46:08,833 --> 00:46:09,916
Well...

596
00:46:10,583 --> 00:46:13,083
if you could go,
where would you like to go?

597
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:16,208
Hmm. Maybe go see a movie,

598
00:46:16,333 --> 00:46:19,041
go shopping in a mall, have lunch,
something like that.

599
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:24,708
Pik.

600
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:28,333
You don't want to hang out with me, right?

601
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:33,000
You ask because you want
to ask Pong out, right?

602
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,958
No, no.

603
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,458
Listen.

604
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:40,375
You have stayed at his place.

605
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,583
It's too late to chicken out.

606
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:46,125
If I were you, I would walk
straight up to him

607
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:49,541
and ask him if he wants to go on a date
and where. That's it.

608
00:46:49,833 --> 00:46:51,250
-Really?
-Yes.

609
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:54,333
Let's go. Right now.

610
00:46:58,208 --> 00:46:59,916
-Right now?
-Yeah.

611
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:02,875
Pong is very popular now.

612
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:05,041
Better hurry before someone snatches him.

613
00:47:05,125 --> 00:47:06,208
He's popular?

614
00:47:08,708 --> 00:47:10,250
-Book.
-Yeah.

615
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:13,916
In this coming match with Nonthavit,
I'll pass you the ball to shoot.

616
00:47:14,208 --> 00:47:15,583
I don't believe it.

617
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:18,416
-You can shoot it yourself.
-Yeah.

618
00:47:25,083 --> 00:47:27,750
If I make the lineup and we win,

619
00:47:29,208 --> 00:47:30,333
let's go celebrate.

620
00:47:30,958 --> 00:47:31,958
Get back there.

621
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:33,250
Come on.

622
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:35,541
[Dome] Hey, Pik.

623
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:39,833
What a surprise! You came just in time.

624
00:47:40,541 --> 00:47:41,958
Who do you come here to see?

625
00:47:50,375 --> 00:47:51,416
Hey, Pik.

626
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:54,833
Good to see you. I need to talk to you.

627
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,625
But I have to talk to you first.

628
00:48:01,583 --> 00:48:02,416
Come.

629
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:03,416
Wait.

630
00:48:08,875 --> 00:48:12,250
She just wants to ask Pong
to go on a date this Sunday.

631
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:14,250
[Dome whispering] Wow. Date on Sunday.

632
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:17,333
This is your surprise?

633
00:48:18,458 --> 00:48:19,583
Where are we going?

634
00:48:20,041 --> 00:48:22,500
-Where do you want to go?
-Pik.

635
00:48:24,583 --> 00:48:27,500
Your mom called me and asked you
to come home this weekend.

636
00:48:28,291 --> 00:48:30,125
But I already have a date with Pong.

637
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:33,791
If she wanted to talk to me,
why wouldn't she call me directly?

638
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:43,000
Let's do this. This weekend,
we'll stay overnight at your house.

639
00:48:43,083 --> 00:48:46,333
We'll hang out in your neighborhood.
Many places around there.

640
00:48:47,708 --> 00:48:48,875
Okay?

641
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,458
But I think we should do this.

642
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,750
Her house is next to mine.

643
00:48:52,958 --> 00:48:55,375
Let's hang out and stay at my house.

644
00:48:57,083 --> 00:48:59,208
[Dome] You three spend the night together?

645
00:48:59,291 --> 00:49:01,750
You, Pong, and Pik.

646
00:49:02,250 --> 00:49:04,083
Great. What a scandal.

647
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,541
Are you sure about this?

648
00:49:06,833 --> 00:49:09,541
Well, then I'll invite everyone
in the club.

649
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:11,708
-Let's go together. Good?
-What?

650
00:49:21,666 --> 00:49:24,458
Tony hired some guys to join.

651
00:49:24,583 --> 00:49:26,958
If his team wins, he'll buy them a treat.

652
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:28,083
Be careful.

653
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,958
Let's get them all at once.
I've got something good.

654
00:50:23,041 --> 00:50:24,000
[boy] Fuck!

655
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:30,875
[in English] You're dead!

656
00:50:38,666 --> 00:50:40,333
[in English] You're dead. Hmm.

657
00:50:59,041 --> 00:51:00,708
[crashing and screaming on TV]

658
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,666
-Hey.
-Yeah?

659
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:23,500
I'm sorry

660
00:51:23,625 --> 00:51:26,666
that I encouraged you to make
the first move on Pong.

661
00:51:26,916 --> 00:51:30,458
Your date has become a group date.

662
00:51:31,791 --> 00:51:32,958
It's all right, Dew.

663
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,916
Pik, let's go outside and talk.

664
00:51:39,916 --> 00:51:41,583
-Tony, I'll be right back.
-Yeah.

665
00:51:57,958 --> 00:51:59,458
Hey, come here. Sit closer.

666
00:52:07,041 --> 00:52:08,083
Pik.

667
00:52:10,333 --> 00:52:12,291
What's the matter with you these days?

668
00:52:12,666 --> 00:52:14,416
Something bothering you?

669
00:52:15,666 --> 00:52:18,250
No, nothing.

670
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:22,583
If that's all, I'll go back inside.

671
00:52:23,375 --> 00:52:25,958
Wait. Let's chat.

672
00:52:30,208 --> 00:52:32,625
Don't feel annoyed about
coming here in a group

673
00:52:34,541 --> 00:52:35,500
because, today,

674
00:52:36,916 --> 00:52:38,166
I wanted to tell you

675
00:52:40,958 --> 00:52:42,208
that you did a good job.

676
00:52:43,791 --> 00:52:45,541
You care more about teamwork.

677
00:52:46,833 --> 00:52:47,875
I really mean it.

678
00:52:54,250 --> 00:52:55,958
Was I really terrible?

679
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:02,666
That was before.

680
00:53:03,583 --> 00:53:06,750
You used to be self-centered.

681
00:53:07,875 --> 00:53:09,583
You didn't care much about others.

682
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:12,916
I can understand, though.

683
00:53:13,333 --> 00:53:15,458
You were an only child, growing up.

684
00:53:19,583 --> 00:53:21,375
But today, you did a very good job.

685
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:25,291
I can see that you have grown up a lot.

686
00:53:27,583 --> 00:53:29,208
Now you have lots of friends,

687
00:53:29,875 --> 00:53:31,416
like Dew and Pong.

688
00:53:34,416 --> 00:53:36,500
Very Good.

689
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:44,000
Can you also see

690
00:53:45,583 --> 00:53:47,166
that Pong has changed?

691
00:53:51,916 --> 00:53:52,916
Yeah.

692
00:53:54,416 --> 00:53:57,625
He seems to be more confident
in what he says and does.

693
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,625
Book, I really want to know,

694
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:20,250
between me and Pong,

695
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:23,750
who do you like to play soccer with?

696
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:26,541
Actually, both of you

697
00:54:27,458 --> 00:54:29,125
have the same playing style

698
00:54:29,833 --> 00:54:31,416
and similar characters.

699
00:54:33,083 --> 00:54:34,708
I like to play soccer with both.

700
00:54:34,791 --> 00:54:36,458
You seem to prefer him.

701
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:42,208
You seem to be more comfortable with him.

702
00:54:51,625 --> 00:54:52,833
It's maybe because

703
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:57,125
I'm a guy, and he's a guy.

704
00:54:57,458 --> 00:54:59,166
So we seem to work well together.

705
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:04,750
But you seem

706
00:55:06,125 --> 00:55:07,875
to be closer to him anyway.

707
00:55:09,958 --> 00:55:11,416
You practice with him

708
00:55:12,416 --> 00:55:13,458
and talk to him,

709
00:55:14,833 --> 00:55:16,041
but never play with me.

710
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,750
If I need to answer that right now,

711
00:55:41,333 --> 00:55:42,791
I think I like him a lot.

712
00:56:02,125 --> 00:56:05,791
But I'm not sure if I should tell him.

713
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,208
If he doesn't feel the same,

714
00:56:09,166 --> 00:56:13,291
it could spoil all of the good things
we have right now.

715
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,708
Why are you sleeping here?

716
00:56:40,708 --> 00:56:42,416
Dew is snoring.

717
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Hmm.

718
00:56:49,458 --> 00:56:50,750
[yawns]

719
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,416
Pik.

720
00:57:06,250 --> 00:57:08,708
Did Book say anything to you
before going to bed?

721
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:22,541
And what did he say to you?

722
00:57:25,333 --> 00:57:27,083
We just talked about...

723
00:57:31,125 --> 00:57:32,583
if we want to tell the truth,

724
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:36,791
but someone can't take it

725
00:57:38,625 --> 00:57:40,083
or might resent it,

726
00:57:43,208 --> 00:57:44,583
should we say it?

727
00:57:45,875 --> 00:57:46,958
Hmm.

728
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,583
Book taught me to be considerate
when saying anything.

729
00:58:04,666 --> 00:58:08,541
You're in between me and Book.

730
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:11,083
You gotta be a pillow for me, too.

731
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,666
[Pong] No cupcake to taste today?

732
00:58:34,375 --> 00:58:36,750
-[Pik] I forgot it in my room.
-What?

733
00:58:36,833 --> 00:58:40,000
Well, then today I teach you
how to get the ball around.

734
00:58:41,208 --> 00:58:43,333
When you get the ball around the opponent,

735
00:58:43,916 --> 00:58:45,125
you have to be focused.

736
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:47,541
Watch and learn.

737
00:59:16,791 --> 00:59:18,791
You haven't found the switching formula?

738
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:24,958
How long will it be?

739
00:59:26,583 --> 00:59:29,583
Why? You don't like the body you're in?

740
00:59:31,208 --> 00:59:35,333
It's not that. I just want
to be with Book in my body.

741
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,458
Why are the girls so crazy about him?

742
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:54,166
Because he's cool,

743
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:58,041
especially when he's playing soccer.

744
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:13,375
I ATE ONE. WAS STARVING.
VERY DELICIOUS -DEW

745
01:01:25,041 --> 01:01:26,291
Can I run with you?

746
01:01:58,416 --> 01:01:59,875
Your face is so red.

747
01:02:00,375 --> 01:02:01,500
Are you sick?

748
01:02:10,958 --> 01:02:12,000
Well,

749
01:02:12,666 --> 01:02:14,833
I'm a little sick. I'll be okay.

750
01:02:21,416 --> 01:02:23,958
It's the last ten minutes.

751
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:27,916
Rajabodin, the superior team,
still couldn't score.

752
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:32,791
It could be that Triston Do is the coach
for Nonthavit this year.

753
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:37,166
Their play style has improved
a lot out of nowhere.

754
01:02:37,333 --> 01:02:39,833
[Satit] That makes a rising star

755
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:42,541
like Pok Pong Pue-on
unsure how to handle it.

756
01:02:42,666 --> 01:02:45,666
[Bouranij] Speaking of him,
in the first match,

757
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,291
he did very well.

758
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:52,250
But in this match, he's a little odd.

759
01:02:52,666 --> 01:02:55,416
Doesn't want to pass the ball
to teammates who are free.

760
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:58,166
Can't maintain how he performed
in the first match.

761
01:02:58,916 --> 01:03:00,958
Pok Pong is playing so differently.

762
01:03:01,416 --> 01:03:04,125
[Satit] Rajabodin has lost the ball
to Nonthavit again.

763
01:03:04,208 --> 01:03:06,041
The game is dragging a bit.

764
01:03:06,833 --> 01:03:09,375
[Bouranij] We haven't seen
any improvement.

765
01:03:10,833 --> 01:03:13,416
Look, everything they do is a mistake.

766
01:03:13,625 --> 01:03:18,750
[Satit] The ref just blew the whistle
to end the game. It's a tie, 0-0.

767
01:03:18,875 --> 01:03:21,833
Rajabodin fans are so disappointed.

768
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:24,916
[Bouranij] Looks like Rajabodin
lost a great chance.

769
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:35,666
If we lost today, it's because of you.

770
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,750
[boy] Hey, that's enough.

771
01:03:39,875 --> 01:03:41,000
[Coach Ble] Hey, stop!

772
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,583
Fighting like dogs!

773
01:04:15,166 --> 01:04:16,250
How are you doing?

774
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:21,416
Fucking Tony started it.

775
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:27,500
-Let's talk about that later.
-Coach also benched me.

776
01:04:28,833 --> 01:04:31,166
And in the end, we tied.

777
01:04:32,125 --> 01:04:35,000
If I had been in the game,
we would have won.

778
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:44,208
But I think, today, you played like you
didn't care about your teammates.

779
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:50,625
You passed the ball to Book only.

780
01:04:50,708 --> 01:04:53,791
You can play soccer now?

781
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,583
Okay. You're good at this.

782
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:01,666
How dare you criticize me?

783
01:05:02,375 --> 01:05:04,041
You couldn't even tell your dad

784
01:05:04,750 --> 01:05:07,041
that you're not good enough
to be in the team.

785
01:05:23,166 --> 01:05:25,166
Pik, what's wrong?

786
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:27,166
Just mind your own business.

787
01:05:37,583 --> 01:05:38,500
Pong.

788
01:05:41,333 --> 01:05:44,416
What did you do to her?
Why was she so upset?

789
01:05:48,833 --> 01:05:50,500
We just had a little fight.

790
01:05:52,583 --> 01:05:53,833
Don't be angry.

791
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,375
I am.

792
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:08,916
Because I like you.

793
01:06:11,458 --> 01:06:12,541
Book.

794
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:28,000
Fuck, Book.

795
01:06:41,875 --> 01:06:42,833
Pong!

796
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:48,791
What?

797
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:50,208
I'm sorry.

798
01:06:51,958 --> 01:06:53,333
I need your help.

799
01:06:54,791 --> 01:06:56,666
I don't want to be like this anymore.

800
01:06:57,833 --> 01:06:59,500
Book said he likes me.

801
01:07:00,166 --> 01:07:01,791
I want to be with him as a girl.

802
01:07:03,125 --> 01:07:04,375
Believe me.

803
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:08,125
Even if we can switch back,

804
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,541
he doesn't like you.

805
01:07:17,708 --> 01:07:18,791
You're saying this

806
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:22,125
because you found the formula?

807
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:25,958
You found it, right?

808
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:29,333
Why didn't you tell me?

809
01:07:37,458 --> 01:07:41,833
Being like this is not my preference.

810
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:46,416
But I can see you're enjoying it.

811
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:49,375
I don't want to be like this anymore.

812
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:52,333
Let's go. Make a cupcake right now.

813
01:07:59,041 --> 01:08:00,125
You...

814
01:08:02,125 --> 01:08:03,583
are worried about your dad?

815
01:08:04,583 --> 01:08:05,916
No.

816
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:09,875
Your dad is okay with it.

817
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,250
You're doing this

818
01:08:17,666 --> 01:08:19,833
because you don't want me to be with Book?

819
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,166
Why, Pong?

820
01:08:34,458 --> 01:08:35,625
Pong.

821
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:38,000
Pong!

822
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:40,375
Pong!

823
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:48,541
Coach Ble decided to punish
you and Pok Pong

824
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:50,500
by suspending you from practice.

825
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,750
You're the captain of the soccer team.

826
01:08:54,083 --> 01:08:57,375
You shouldn't have let such a scandal
leak onto social media.

827
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:04,791
May I say something, sir?

828
01:09:05,416 --> 01:09:07,791
First, I would like to say sorry
for everything.

829
01:09:08,416 --> 01:09:12,333
I know that I have tarnished the long-time
image of the school and soccer club.

830
01:09:12,666 --> 01:09:14,333
But may I ask one thing from you?

831
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,208
Please punish me only.

832
01:09:18,083 --> 01:09:20,458
Pong had nothing to do with it.

833
01:09:23,791 --> 01:09:25,208
At the time,

834
01:09:27,041 --> 01:09:29,000
what I did was purely from my feelings.

835
01:09:30,791 --> 01:09:32,500
I'm not even sure

836
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:34,875
how I really feel about it.

837
01:09:37,333 --> 01:09:38,541
I only know that

838
01:09:44,833 --> 01:09:46,083
I like Pong a lot.

839
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:49,916
Such a gentleman.

840
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:52,916
You're a Rajabodin gentleman.

841
01:10:00,958 --> 01:10:02,000
Ladies.

842
01:10:02,416 --> 01:10:05,250
Why don't you come in
and take his picture?

843
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:07,625
Cheese!

844
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:28,125
So cute.

845
01:10:33,416 --> 01:10:37,583
Pik, how come your cupcake is ugly again?

846
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,583
Because when we make a cupcake,

847
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,916
we think of the one we love.

848
01:11:35,250 --> 01:11:36,208
Pong.

849
01:11:38,375 --> 01:11:40,083
What do you think of the rumor?

850
01:11:43,041 --> 01:11:43,916
What about you?

851
01:11:50,750 --> 01:11:51,916
I don't know.

852
01:12:01,916 --> 01:12:03,041
I only know...

853
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:10,041
that I'm very happy right now.

854
01:12:23,958 --> 01:12:25,041
Let's take a selfie.

855
01:12:26,208 --> 01:12:27,375
Okay.

856
01:12:46,875 --> 01:12:47,958
Let's be together.

857
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,208
Bye.

858
01:13:57,833 --> 01:13:58,750
Oh!

859
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:22,125
Here.

860
01:14:30,875 --> 01:14:31,708
[squeals]

861
01:14:36,291 --> 01:14:38,291
[man on TV] How could you do this to me?

862
01:14:38,375 --> 01:14:41,291
[woman on TV] You did it to yourself.
You can't blame me.

863
01:14:41,375 --> 01:14:45,208
[man] What happened? I don't
understand why you've changed.

864
01:14:51,750 --> 01:14:54,875
[woman] I told you from
the beginning that I like someone else.

865
01:14:54,958 --> 01:14:57,208
You can't say that I have changed.

866
01:15:38,416 --> 01:15:39,958
[Eve] Let's eat a cupcake.

867
01:15:40,916 --> 01:15:44,333
Delicious food can make us feel better.

868
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:49,458
Here.

869
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:51,916
Eat it.

870
01:16:13,875 --> 01:16:15,708
Don't let those scumbags

871
01:16:16,958 --> 01:16:19,083
ruin our perfect cupcakes.

872
01:16:25,791 --> 01:16:30,750
Not all men are like that, Eve.

873
01:16:58,333 --> 01:17:00,958
Your dad called and said that,
this coming match,

874
01:17:03,250 --> 01:17:05,375
he'll bring a coach
from the national team.

875
01:17:13,375 --> 01:17:14,875
That's all I came to tell you.

876
01:17:16,583 --> 01:17:17,416
Pik.

877
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:20,833
Believe me.

878
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:26,791
Book likes you not only because
you two get along...

879
01:17:37,750 --> 01:17:39,333
but because you're a guy.

880
01:17:47,708 --> 01:17:49,125
Stay out of this.

881
01:17:53,500 --> 01:17:54,833
From now on,

882
01:17:56,583 --> 01:17:58,250
I'm okay with being in your body.

883
01:17:59,666 --> 01:18:00,958
I get to play soccer,

884
01:18:02,458 --> 01:18:03,916
be with Book openly.

885
01:18:05,625 --> 01:18:06,666
I can take it.

886
01:19:47,791 --> 01:19:50,666
[boy] They're girly desserts.
Are you really gonna eat it?

887
01:19:51,208 --> 01:19:53,166
Really?

888
01:20:01,458 --> 01:20:02,291
[Book] Pik.

889
01:20:05,958 --> 01:20:07,750
[Coach Ble] What is she doing here?

890
01:20:11,791 --> 01:20:12,625
[all exclaiming]

891
01:20:15,041 --> 01:20:15,875
[Eve] Pik.

892
01:20:16,583 --> 01:20:17,416
Book.

893
01:20:18,958 --> 01:20:19,916
What's up with you?

894
01:20:40,791 --> 01:20:41,625
Care to join?

895
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,500
[cheering]

896
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:53,416
May I use your body to play soccer
for a day?

897
01:20:54,833 --> 01:20:58,416
[Pik] Promise me first that we're
gonna find a way to switch back.

898
01:20:58,875 --> 01:21:00,250
I promise.

899
01:21:08,333 --> 01:21:09,625
[Pong] You're doing this

900
01:21:12,208 --> 01:21:14,333
because you don't want me to be with Book?

901
01:21:15,708 --> 01:21:16,791
Why, Pong?

902
01:21:24,708 --> 01:21:25,916
Why are you doing this?

903
01:21:32,541 --> 01:21:33,583
Because I love you.

904
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,041
Huh?

905
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:16,458
These are examples. From one to three.

906
01:22:16,666 --> 01:22:18,916
Let's review the answers,

907
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,958
how we came to these mathematically.

908
01:22:21,041 --> 01:22:24,416
We have come to the solutions
of questions one to three.

909
01:22:24,500 --> 01:22:26,208
Does anyone still not understand?

910
01:22:26,541 --> 01:22:27,375
Anyone?

911
01:22:27,458 --> 01:22:29,666
Those who understand it all,
raise your hand.

912
01:22:30,833 --> 01:22:32,541
Okay, not everyone.

913
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,625
[Pong] I haven't seen Pik since.

914
01:22:47,083 --> 01:22:48,625
She stayed in her room.

915
01:22:54,208 --> 01:22:55,333
I saw only Book.

916
01:23:01,333 --> 01:23:02,166
Pong.

917
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,166
Book.

918
01:23:12,083 --> 01:23:13,416
Let me say this.

919
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,875
Whatever you think of us,

920
01:23:20,833 --> 01:23:23,250
how good you think it was,

921
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:27,291
I'm not the same Pong you knew.

922
01:23:28,791 --> 01:23:30,000
I'm so sorry.

923
01:23:40,083 --> 01:23:41,750
[crowd cheering]

924
01:23:42,625 --> 01:23:43,791
[announcers chattering]

925
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:47,500
[Satit] The defending champions,
Rajabodin, are playing against Taweewat.

926
01:23:47,583 --> 01:23:50,166
They are ten-time champions.

927
01:23:50,250 --> 01:23:54,958
Let's see if they can defend
their championship again this year.

928
01:23:55,083 --> 01:23:57,833
[announcers chattering]

929
01:23:59,875 --> 01:24:02,208
[Pong] I got to play
in the championship match.

930
01:24:02,291 --> 01:24:04,791
Neither Book nor I could play well.

931
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:07,166
I played really terribly.

932
01:24:07,666 --> 01:24:10,125
And Book seemed disheartened.

933
01:24:14,291 --> 01:24:16,458
Everybody thought that
we couldn't play well

934
01:24:16,666 --> 01:24:17,916
because we had broken up.

935
01:24:21,166 --> 01:24:22,208
[crowd exclaiming]

936
01:24:23,333 --> 01:24:24,833
Except my dad.

937
01:24:28,208 --> 01:24:29,541
Dew and Dome said,

938
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:32,750
when Pik learned that Book and I
stopped talking,

939
01:24:33,000 --> 01:24:36,375
she got even worse
than when she had a fight with me.

940
01:24:36,458 --> 01:24:37,500
Damn it!

941
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:41,875
[Pong] Pik came out
and went to cupcake club.

942
01:24:42,041 --> 01:24:44,791
Grabbed every kind of sprinkles
to eat back in her room.

943
01:24:44,958 --> 01:24:48,500
But she didn't know that I had got rid
of the switching ones.

944
01:24:53,958 --> 01:24:54,791
Fern. Linchee.

945
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:03,208
[Pong] Eve didn't get why Pik changed.

946
01:25:04,166 --> 01:25:05,583
But she accepted it.

947
01:25:21,166 --> 01:25:22,041
[Dew] Pong!

948
01:25:22,708 --> 01:25:26,083
Pik has just left the room
carrying a ball.

949
01:25:34,708 --> 01:25:36,666
[Pong] I tried to see her,

950
01:25:51,916 --> 01:25:53,416
but she didn't let me.

951
01:25:54,833 --> 01:25:56,583
The only person she talked to

952
01:25:58,125 --> 01:25:59,166
was Book.

953
01:26:02,750 --> 01:26:05,291
As soon as he knew that
she got angry easily again,

954
01:26:05,625 --> 01:26:06,875
he got worried about her.

955
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:09,000
He is there for her as always.

956
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:13,166
I don't know what he talked to her about.

957
01:26:22,166 --> 01:26:24,791
Hey, Pong. Pong.

958
01:26:25,500 --> 01:26:26,500
Have you heard?

959
01:26:26,875 --> 01:26:28,791
Pik is really fearless.

960
01:26:29,708 --> 01:26:31,708
She quit school without telling anybody.

961
01:26:32,125 --> 01:26:34,541
I saw her mom picking her up last night.

962
01:26:36,875 --> 01:26:39,041
Yeah. You go ahead.

963
01:26:39,458 --> 01:26:40,875
I'll meet my dad over there.

964
01:26:40,958 --> 01:26:43,291
Okay. See you at practice

965
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:44,833
-next week.
-See you.

966
01:27:25,791 --> 01:27:28,833
[Pik] You were right, Pong.
Book didn't like me.

967
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:32,291
Thank you for being me
and letting me be you.

968
01:27:32,916 --> 01:27:35,125
Let's play soccer again this summer.

969
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:36,083
[chuckles]

970
01:27:58,833 --> 01:28:01,833
We're "Ja" Satit Krikul
and "Borboo" Bouranij Rattanavichien.

971
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:03,333
We're the announcers.

972
01:28:05,125 --> 01:28:06,958
-I scored a goal!
-Hey.

973
01:28:10,666 --> 01:28:13,833
Losing a boyfriend to a guy
is not easy to accept.

974
01:28:24,041 --> 01:28:25,291
Bonita!
