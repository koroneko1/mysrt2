BRAD: Psst.

01:11:12.082 --> 01:11:15.116
SERENA: He took the long way,
and then he kissed you.

01:11:17.087 --> 01:11:18.587
How did you know?

01:11:18.622 --> 01:11:21.556
I'm your Serena, dear.
I know everything.

01:11:22.192 --> 01:11:23.358
Yeah, but why?

01:11:24.027 --> 01:11:26.228
Why did
he kiss me?

01:11:26.263 --> 01:11:27.829
Was it because
of the spell?

01:11:27.864 --> 01:11:30.398
What's the difference?
You're irresistible.

01:11:30.434 --> 01:11:32.033
That's what you wanted.

01:11:33.002 --> 01:11:35.670
Yeah, but if it was
because of the spell, then,

01:11:35.706 --> 01:11:37.939
I mean, how do I know
he really cares?

01:11:37.974 --> 01:11:40.742
Louise, darling,
what's the difference?

01:11:40.777 --> 01:11:43.111
The difference is,
I don't want him to just

01:11:43.146 --> 01:11:44.613
suddenly
stop liking me.

01:11:44.648 --> 01:11:47.315
Well, that happens
with or without magic.

01:11:47.351 --> 01:11:49.016
Not if love is real.

01:11:49.052 --> 01:11:51.653

01:12:00.530 --> 01:12:01.929
When he kissed me,

01:12:03.032 --> 01:12:04.799
was he really kissing me?

01:12:06.870 --> 01:12:10.605
Louise, nothing
lasts forever.

01:12:10.641 --> 01:12:13.541
That is just too
depressing to believe.

01:12:13.577 --> 01:12:14.809
I mean, some people
fall in love,

01:12:14.844 --> 01:12:16.478
and they stay in love.

01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:28.389
a way to reverse
the spell,

01:22:28.424 --> 01:22:30.157
and I can't find anything
in this whole book.

01:22:31.127 --> 01:22:33.761
What do you mean
reverse the spells?

01:22:33.796 --> 01:22:35.763
I mean make it go back

01:22:35.798 --> 01:22:36.898
the way it was.
I just want

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.465
everything and
everyone

01:22:38.601 --> 01:22:39.901
to go back the way it was.

01:22:39.936 --> 01:22:40.868
Reverse?

01:22:41.771 --> 01:22:43.637
Now that I have all this?

01:22:44.340 --> 01:22:46.607
Absolutely not!

01:22:48.311 --> 01:22:50.111
Serena!

01:22:50.146 --> 01:22:53.881
Louise, everyone loves
and listens to you, right?

01:22:54.384 --> 01:22:55.649
Yeah.

01:22:55.684 --> 01:22:58.585
They agree with me before
I even finish what I'm saying.

01:22:58.621 --> 01:23:00.321
Picky, picky.

01:23:00.356 --> 01:23:01.923
You don't know
what a luxury it is

01:23:01.958 --> 01:23:03.891
to have people
agree with you.

01:23:03.927 --> 01:23:05.492
I'm not happy, okay?

01:23:05.528 --> 01:23:07.895
Who is happy?
You'll get used to it.

01:23:09.032 --> 01:23:10.298
Believe me.

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:12.699
You're going to
knock 'em dead at the dance.

01:23:13.602 --> 01:23:15.336
You want to
give that up?

01:23:15.371 --> 01:23:18.072
I just...
I want to be me.

01:23:18.107 --> 01:23:19.407
I mean, all this stuff
is happening,

01:23:19.542 --> 01:23:22.176
but it just...
I don't know.

01:23:22.211 --> 01:23:24.678
It just doesn't feel like
it's happening to me.

01:23:24.713 --> 01:23:27.448
Let's give it a shot
for a couple of years,

01:23:27.483 --> 01:23:29.150
and then
make a decision.

01:23:29.185 --> 01:23:31.152
Come on, Serena.
Help me.

01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:32.987
Please?

01:23:36.659 --> 01:23:38.459
Come here.
Sit down.

01:23:58.514 --> 01:23:59.813
All right.

01:24:00.950 --> 01:24:02.549
It's lonely.

01:24:04.587 --> 01:24:06.153
I know.

01:24:06.189 --> 01:24:08.255
I had to make
people like me.

01:24:09.492 --> 01:24:11.725
You never knew
how people felt?

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.461
I didn't want to
take the chance.

01:24:14.964 --> 01:24:16.697
So I can
change it all, huh?

01:24:18.834 --> 01:24:20.067
The real magic...

01:24:21.437 --> 01:24:23.704
Is believing in yourself.

01:24:25.174 --> 01:24:27.375
If you can do that,

01:24:27.410 --> 01:24:30.077
you can make anything happen.

01:24:33.616 --> 01:24:34.915
Thank you.

01:24:36.252 --> 01:24:37.985
(POP SONG PLAYING)

01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.114
My dad got me into Stanford.
He's a Stanford man.

01:25:07.150 --> 01:25:09.183
Yeah? I want to go
Vidal Sassoon,

01:25:09.218 --> 01:25:12.253
but my mother's making me go
to Malcolm Junior college.

01:25:12.288 --> 01:25:13.587
I got into SF State

01:25:13.622 --> 01:25:16.257
and Brad's going
to visit me every weekend,

01:25:16.292 --> 01:25:17.624
aren't you, honey?

01:25:17.660 --> 01:25:19.126
So, did your dad
get you the car?

01:25:19.162 --> 01:25:22.530
No. He got me a Schwinn.
Can you believe it?

01:25:24.100 --> 01:25:25.199
It's like I'm cursed!

01:25:27.070 --> 01:25:28.936
(POP SONG CONTINUES)

01:25:45.688 --> 01:25:47.788
You know,
it could've
been worse.

01:25:47.823 --> 01:25:49.990
You could've
been here
with that.

01:25:53.196 --> 01:25:54.628
I don't know.

01:25:56.365 --> 01:25:57.698
All right, guys.
