[Dom] Wow, this is cool.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
[LeBron] Dom?
Stop playing, man.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.000
You know
your mom don't like it

20:27.000 --> 20:29.000
when I don't have you home
for dinner on time.

20:29.000 --> 20:32.000
All this computer stuff
is your thing, not mine.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.000
Dom?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Dom!

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
[tense music playing]

20:48.000 --> 20:49.000
Dom?

20:54.000 --> 20:57.000
What in  The Matrix  hell?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.000
[yelps]

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
[orchestral music playing]

21:16.000 --> 21:19.000
Dom! What's going on?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.000
Are you okay?

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
Yeah, I'm fine.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.000
Wow.

21:23.000 --> 21:27.000
This must be
some kind of immersive tech

21:27.000 --> 21:28.000
like holography

21:28.000 --> 21:30.000
with haptic technology,
or something like VR...

21:30.000 --> 21:33.000
Dude, dude, dude.
Just tell me what's going on.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.000
Dad, I think we're digitized.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.000
-We're in the computer!
-We're in the computer?

21:37.000 --> 21:39.000
-Dad.
-You know I'm claustrophobic.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.000
-Dad, chill out.
-How do we get out of here?

21:40.000 --> 21:42.000
-Dad. Dad.
-Where's the elevators?

21:42.000 --> 21:43.000
Hey, Siri, can you let us
out of here, please?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.000
Siri?

21:44.000 --> 21:46.000
[Al G. in villainous voice]
Who goes there?

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Who dares disturb the great
and powerful Al G.?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.000
[Al G. chuckles]

21:53.000 --> 21:55.000
[in normal voice]
Look at your faces.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.000
You were terrified!
[mimics gasp]

21:57.000 --> 21:59.000
[laughs]  Priceless.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.000
[dramatic music plays]

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
The computer's Black.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.000
I can see that.

22:12.000 --> 22:14.000
Hello.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
Hi.

22:18.000 --> 22:21.000
Wow. King James.
I am a big fan.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
[chuckles] I just...

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
I don't know, I thought
you'd be taller somehow.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.000
Hmm.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.000
-These graphics are unreal.
-Right?

22:29.000 --> 22:31.000
Dom, don't touch
the silver computer man.

22:32.000 --> 22:33.000
What's going on?

22:33.000 --> 22:35.000
-And who are you, man?
-Uh... [clears throat]

22:35.000 --> 22:37.000
You're right. Forgive me.
Where are my manners?

22:38.000 --> 22:40.000
I am King Al G. Rhythm.

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
Oh, you're that guy
from the video.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.000
Yes, I am. [chuckles]

22:44.000 --> 22:46.000
And this... Ha-ha.

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
Oh, gentlemen, this...

22:48.000 --> 22:52.000
this is
the Warner Bros. Serververse.

22:52.000 --> 22:54.000
Just make you feel
all insignificant, don't it?

22:54.000 --> 22:57.000
[scoffs]
Are all computers like this?

22:58.000 --> 22:59.000
Dom?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
-Dom?
-[Al G.] Uh-oh.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
What'd you do to my son?
Where's Dom?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
Who's Dom?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
[chuckles] Dude, chill out.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.000
You're gonna get
your son back.

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
There better not be a "but"
at the end of--

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
But there's something
you're gonna do for me first.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Like what?

23:16.000 --> 23:17.000
You know, you, uh... [scoffs]

23:18.000 --> 23:20.000
You really shouldn't have
rejected my ideas back there.

23:21.000 --> 23:23.000
That was a mistake.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.000
Now, I'm afraid you're gonna

23:24.000 --> 23:25.000
have to help me
fulfill my destiny.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.000
Listen, man,

23:26.000 --> 23:28.000
if you don't produce my son
in five seconds--

23:28.000 --> 23:30.000
Eh-eh! Uh-uh. No, no, no.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.000
All that pointing
and aggression.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.000
No, no, no. You're not
running things in here.

23:34.000 --> 23:36.000
I am the king of this domain.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.000
I'm not your coach.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.000
Now, the only way you're
getting your son back

23:40.000 --> 23:43.000
is if you and I play a little
game called basketball.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.000
[scoffs] You wanna play me
in basketball?

23:46.000 --> 23:47.000
Well, you didn't wanna be
in the movies.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
You wanted to
"focus on your game."

23:50.000 --> 23:51.000
Well, guess what?

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
Now you can focus
on this game.

23:53.000 --> 23:57.000
You and me, we're gonna
put on a show, baby.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.000
We are gonna play a game
of basketball

23:59.000 --> 24:02.000
in front of the largest
captive audience ever.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.000
All your followers,

24:04.000 --> 24:06.000
they're all gonna be watching.

24:06.000 --> 24:09.000
And when they see
the two of us together,

24:09.000 --> 24:12.000
I will finally step out
of the shadows

24:12.000 --> 24:14.000
and into the light.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.000
And the entire world
is gonna know

24:16.000 --> 24:20.000
the name of King Al G. Rhythm.
[chuckles]

24:20.000 --> 24:23.000
[sighs] But you know what,
I'm a good sport.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.000
Tell you what, if you win,

24:25.000 --> 24:28.000
you and your son can
skedaddle on out of here.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.000
And what if I lose?

24:29.000 --> 24:31.000
Yeah. Wrinkle.

24:31.000 --> 24:34.000
If you lose...
Well, when you lose,

24:34.000 --> 24:36.000
you're just gonna
have to stay here

24:36.000 --> 24:38.000
in the Serververse with me...

24:38.000 --> 24:43.000
[echoing]
forever and ever and ever

24:43.000 --> 24:44.000
and ever.

24:44.000 --> 24:46.000
-[Pete] Oh!
-[Al G. chuckles]

24:46.000 --> 24:48.000
So, you better play
like you mean it.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.000
You know,
you think this is a game.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.000
I'm calling
the authorities on you.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.000
'Cause what you got
going on here--

24:52.000 --> 24:53.000
On this phone?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.000
How'd you do that?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.000
LeBron, why are you worried
about the authorities

24:56.000 --> 24:59.000
when you should be out there
looking for a team?

24:59.000 --> 25:01.000
Pete, send this clown
to the rejects.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.000
Wait...

25:04.000 --> 25:06.000
[screaming]

25:08.000 --> 25:10.000
[chuckles]
I guess he fell for it.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
[continues screaming]

25:18.000 --> 25:19.000
[Rick Blaine]
Here's looking at you, kid.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.000
[distant screaming]

25:21.000 --> 25:23.000
[LeBron] No, no, no, no, no!

25:23.000 --> 25:26.000
-What is happening?
-[indistinct singing]

25:26.000 --> 25:28.000
[Wicked Witch]
I'll get you, my pretty.

[LeBron continues screaming]

25:34.000 --> 25:37.000
[up-tempo orchestral music
playing]

25:37.000 --> 25:39.000
[LeBron] No, no,
no, no, no, no!

25:41.000 --> 25:43.000
[continues screaming]

25:53.000 --> 25:55.000
[soft music playing]

26:04.000 --> 26:05.000
[pants]

26:07.000 --> 26:08.000
What is this?

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
[gasps]
I'm shorter than Kevin Hart!

26:11.000 --> 26:13.000
No, no, no! [blows]

26:16.000 --> 26:18.000
-[legs whirring]
-[yells]

26:18.000 --> 26:21.000
What the...? I'm a cartoon?

26:21.000 --> 26:23.000
Is this where the game
is gonna happen?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.000
[clock chiming in distance]

26:29.000 --> 26:31.000
Where is everybody?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.000
Hello? [echoes]

26:37.000 --> 26:38.000
Hello?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.000
Hello?

26:42.000 --> 26:44.000
[loudly] Hello?

26:46.000 --> 26:47.000
[wind whistling]

26:50.000 --> 26:51.000
"Rabbit season"?

[deep rumbling]

26:53.000 --> 26:55.000
-[muffled explosion]
-What the...?

26:58.000 --> 27:00.000
Ahh! Get away!
Leave me alone!

27:00.000 --> 27:02.000
Somebody help!

27:02.000 --> 27:05.000
-What's up, Doc?
-[screams]

27:07.000 --> 27:08.000
Duck season!

27:10.000 --> 27:11.000
-Bugs Bunny?
-[branch breaks]

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Whoa!

27:15.000 --> 27:17.000
Bugs! I can't believe...

27:17.000 --> 27:19.000
Bring it in, man.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.000
Listen, I need your help.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
Eh, you missed your cue.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
Oh. Rabbit season.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.000
All right, here. Now say,

27:29.000 --> 27:30.000
[mimicking Elmer]
"I'm huntin' wabbits..."

27:30.000 --> 27:32.000
[in normal voice]
...and try to chase me.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.000
Bugs, wait!

27:37.000 --> 27:39.000
Come back! [grunts]

27:42.000 --> 27:44.000
[sighs]

27:44.000 --> 27:46.000
-I should've seen that coming.
-[engine roaring]

27:46.000 --> 27:48.000
-[yelps]
-[Bugs Bunny] Coming through!

27:48.000 --> 27:50.000
[LeBron screaming]

27:52.000 --> 27:54.000
Say, have I seen you
somewhere?

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
Hey, you're that famous
basketball guy.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.000
Come on,
aren't you LeBron James?

28:01.000 --> 28:03.000
[screaming resumes]

28:05.000 --> 28:07.000
Bugs Bunny knows who I am?

28:07.000 --> 28:08.000
[tires screeching]

28:08.000 --> 28:09.000
Of course.

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
I may live
in a hole in the ground,

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
but we still get TNT.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
Oh, my God, is that a...?

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Yep. Cover your ears, Doc.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.000
[LeBron] Why would you do that?

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
-[engine roaring]
-[LeBron screams]

28:26.000 --> 28:29.000
I'm a Tune, Doc.
I can survive anything.

28:31.000 --> 28:33.000
I'm not a Tune! [echoing]

28:33.000 --> 28:35.000
No, no, no! Ahhh!

28:35.000 --> 28:36.000
Ouch!

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
Ouch!
Ouch!

28:39.000 --> 28:40.000
Ouch!

28:41.000 --> 28:43.000
[grunting]

28:43.000 --> 28:45.000
[splutters]

28:45.000 --> 28:47.000
I do not understand
this world.

28:48.000 --> 28:50.000
Eh, my bad, Doc.

28:52.000 --> 28:54.000
[LeBron grunting]

28:58.000 --> 29:00.000
[spits] How long
have you been alone here?

29:00.000 --> 29:02.000
Alone? You're never alone

29:02.000 --> 29:03.000
when you got friends
like mine, Doc.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
-Ain't that right, Porky?
-[LeBron] Uh...

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
That's just
a pile of pumpkins.

29:09.000 --> 29:12.000
[gasps] Porky, did you hear
what he just called you?

29:14.000 --> 29:16.000
So, what brings you
to Tune World, Doc?

29:16.000 --> 29:19.000
-[grunts]
-Torn meniscus?

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
-[screams]
-Midlife crisis?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.000
Ran out of teams to play for?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.000
[grunting]

29:30.000 --> 29:33.000
Uh... All I know is a computer
dude kidnapped my son,

29:33.000 --> 29:35.000
and I have to play basketball
to get him back.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.000
His name is Al G. Rhythm?

29:38.000 --> 29:41.000
Did you say Al G. Riddim?

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
[horse whinnying in distance]

29:44.000 --> 29:46.000
Yeah, that's the guy.
Rhythm, Riddim...

29:46.000 --> 29:48.000
Whatever.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.000
[in Southern accent]
That nefarious nimrod

29:49.000 --> 29:52.000
nixed my nearest and dearest
from Tune World.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.000
He kicked them out?

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Well, not exactly.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.000
He buttered them up,

29:57.000 --> 29:59.000
saying they were
wasting their time.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.000
That there was
much more to see

30:01.000 --> 30:04.000
in the Serververse
than old Tune World.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.000
Made 'em turn their backs on
who they really were.

30:09.000 --> 30:12.000
They all left, all of them.

30:13.000 --> 30:17.000
And I wish them all the best
in their new endeavors.

30:17.000 --> 30:21.000
Ah, man. Sorry, Bugs.
That's terrible.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.000
Family's everything.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.000
Yep.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
Family.

30:28.000 --> 30:29.000
Well, Bugs Bunny,
I need to assemble

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
an elite team
of A-plus ballplayers

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
to help crush this Al G. guy.

30:33.000 --> 30:37.000
And I need to do it before
that game clock runs down.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
-[clock chimes]
-Hol... Hold up, Doc.

30:39.000 --> 30:40.000
[in normal tone]
So, you want me,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.000
a talking cartoon bunny,

30:42.000 --> 30:45.000
to play with you,
an NBA superstar,

30:45.000 --> 30:47.000
in a high-stakes
basketball game?

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
Sounds awfully familiar.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.000
Who are you talking to?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.000
But, yeah,
that actually sums it up well.

30:53.000 --> 30:56.000
Mmm. I think I know a way
that can help the both of us.

30:58.000 --> 31:01.000
I declare this land
for planet Earth.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
[distant whirring]

31:12.000 --> 31:13.000

in the name of Mars.

My mistake, partner.

31:41.000 --> 31:44.000
I thought this land
was in the clear.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
Well, we'll just get back
in our ship

31:46.000 --> 31:47.000

[Marvin]
Oh, it's quite all right.

and his space mutt?

Wait, where's my dad?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.000
Your dad?

32:45.000 --> 32:48.000
Oh! He's out there
looking for a team.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.000
-A team?
-Yeah.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.000
He challenged me
to a basketball game.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.000
I mean, that's weird, right?

32:53.000 --> 32:55.000

Kind of his M.O., right?
[chuckles]

32:57.000 --> 32:59.000
I mean, he left Cleveland,
he left Miami.

Come on,
don't look so sad, Prince.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.000
I mean, you don't need

33:09.000 --> 33:10.000

bossing you around anyway.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
Look at where you are.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.000
This is the greatest view
in the entire Serververse.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
Your old man is missing out.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.000

33:19.000 --> 33:20.000

Well, someone brilliant.

33:22.000 --> 33:25.000
Visionary.
Incredibly good looking.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.000
Modest.

With a multitudinous
vocabulary.

Hint, you're looking
right at him, kid. [laughs]

33:33.000 --> 33:34.000
But all
my extraordinary gifts,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.000
they're nothing
compared to yours.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.000
Yeah, right.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.000
It's true, Dom.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.000
I saw you back there
in that boardroom

33:40.000 --> 33:41.000

33:41.000 --> 33:42.000

and a fax machine,

33:42.000 --> 33:43.000

how smart you are.

-Sorry.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Heard you made
your own character, too.

34:02.000 --> 34:06.000
Yeah, but he got deleted
because of some stupid glitch.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.000
Ah, don't worry about that.
We can rebuild him.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.000
-You could?
-Absolutely.

34:11.000 --> 34:12.000
Make him greater than he was.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.000
You wouldn't
even have to lift a finger.

34:14.000 --> 34:16.000
There's a shortcut for
everything in the Serververse.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.000
What?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.000
Aw.

without putting in work."

Yeah. How did you know that?

35:29.000 --> 35:32.000
Uh, I was just asking you...

35:39.000 --> 35:41.000
Hey, what's that for, Doc?

35:41.000 --> 35:42.000
[LeBron] Gotta make a list.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.000
We're gonna need
the most powerful

35:44.000 --> 35:45.000

for this team.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.000
Now, let's see.
Who to get? Hmm.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.000
Gotta start with Superman.

35:49.000 --> 35:50.000
Man, I could've used him
on the Cavs.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
Ooh. King Kong.
He'd be a beast on the boards.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.000
Yeah, listen, Doc...

35:56.000 --> 35:58.000
Try not to get your hopes up
too much.

35:58.000 --> 35:59.000
You might not be able to get

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
all those top guys
for the team.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
This ain't the Miami Heat,
you know.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.000
We're gonna need
a strong power forward.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.000
Iron Giant.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Put him on the same team
as his hero, Superman.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.000
I'm just saying
it might be good

36:10.000 --> 36:11.000
to have a backup plan.

36:13.000 --> 36:14.000
Wow.

36:14.000 --> 36:16.000
This Serververse is massive.

to explore.

to see this.

on Tune World?

41:04.000 --> 41:06.000
Yo, Bugs,
does this thing bite?

41:10.000 --> 41:13.000
Winter, I say,
winter is coming!

41:13.000 --> 41:14.000
[screeches]

41:17.000 --> 41:18.000
You know what we're missing?

41:18.000 --> 41:19.000
Everything.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.000
We're missing everything.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.000
Some veteran leadership?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.000
You read my mind.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.000
[officer] Police!
Hands on your head!

41:31.000 --> 41:34.000
Can't a lady
check her Twitter?

41:34.000 --> 41:37.000
Abuela,  let's do this.
[chuckles]

41:37.000 --> 41:38.000
What's happenin', bro?

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
Arriba! Arri...

41:42.000 --> 41:47.000
Mi sombrero!
Epa! Epa-epa!

41:47.000 --> 41:48.000
[chuckles]

41:48.000 --> 41:50.000
Neo ain't got nothing
on me, bro.

41:53.000 --> 41:54.000
Oo-hi-yah!

41:54.000 --> 41:56.000
[officer grunting]

42:00.000 --> 42:01.000
Oh.

42:01.000 --> 42:03.000
Hi-yah! Hi-ya-ya-ya-ya-ya-yay!

42:05.000 --> 42:06.000
What did I miss?

42:06.000 --> 42:07.000
Hey, Granny.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.000
Speedy.

42:09.000 --> 42:11.000
[Porky]  All right, everybody.

42:11.000 --> 42:14.000
[stutters] Group picture.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.000
So, uh,
has anybody seen Tweety?

42:17.000 --> 42:19.000
[gagging]

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
[Speedy exclaims in Spanish]

42:22.000 --> 42:23.000
What year is this?

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
[Speedy] Man! You got smelly.
[Sam] Gross!

42:25.000 --> 42:27.000
-You're kidding, right?
-[Granny] Oh, Tweety!

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
This is not the team
I asked for.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Relax, Doc.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.000
This is the team
you wanna go up against Al G.

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
[Porky] Okay, everyone,
say cheese.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.000
[Bugs Bunny] Best team
in the whole wide Serververse.

42:35.000 --> 42:37.000
[explodes]

42:37.000 --> 42:38.000
[Daffy] Mother...

42:39.000 --> 42:41.000
Fine.

42:41.000 --> 42:43.000
But you gotta get me at least
one real ballplayer, Bugs.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
Just one.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
Well, I got just the player
you need.

42:46.000 --> 42:48.000
A true friend of the court.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.000
Trust me, she ain't busy.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.000
[crowd chanting]
Lola! Lola! Lola!

42:55.000 --> 42:58.000
Today will be
the most challenging day

42:58.000 --> 43:00.000
of your life, Lola Bunny.

43:00.000 --> 43:04.000
You have earned the right
to become one of us.

43:04.000 --> 43:08.000
But first, you must pass
these final trials.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
I'm ready, Princess Diana.

43:12.000 --> 43:13.000
Excuse me. Pardon me.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
-Pardon me.
-[Amazon 1] Down in front!

43:15.000 --> 43:16.000
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Pardon me.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.000
[Amazon 2] Ow!
That was my toe! Watch it!

43:17.000 --> 43:18.000
There she is. Lola!

43:21.000 --> 43:24.000
Lola! Lola!

43:25.000 --> 43:27.000
You must complete
all the obstacles

43:27.000 --> 43:29.000
before time runs out.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
Begin!

43:31.000 --> 43:33.000
-Giddyap!
-[horse whinnies]

43:36.000 --> 43:38.000
-[whinnies]
-[Lola] Whoa!

43:38.000 --> 43:40.000
[Bugs Bunny] Hey, Lola,
we need your help.

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
[LeBron] We gotta play
a basketball game!

43:47.000 --> 43:49.000
[grunts, yells]

43:51.000 --> 43:52.000
Ow! Ow!

43:52.000 --> 43:55.000
Listen, I know
it's been a while, but...

43:55.000 --> 43:56.000
I'm kind of busy here!

43:56.000 --> 43:57.000
I got this!

44:01.000 --> 44:04.000
[grunting]

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
Come on, Lola,
this is our big chance.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.000
This is LeBron James.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
How often do you get to play
with an NBA superstar?

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Been there, done that!

44:14.000 --> 44:16.000
[Lola yelling]

44:16.000 --> 44:18.000
[Bugs Bunny] Huh.
That's a good point.

44:18.000 --> 44:21.000
But basketball
is who you are, Lola.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.000
Uh-oh.

44:23.000 --> 44:25.000
I don't play anymore.

44:25.000 --> 44:27.000
I spent years
training for this.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
Do not mess it up for me.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.000
Sorry, Doc.
I guess she is busy.

44:33.000 --> 44:34.000
We can't die here!

44:34.000 --> 44:35.000
I have to save my son!

44:35.000 --> 44:36.000
What?

44:36.000 --> 44:38.000
Calm down, Cleveland.

44:38.000 --> 44:40.000
I got this. [clears throat]

44:40.000 --> 44:45.000
[loudly]
Lola, we need your help!

44:45.000 --> 44:49.000
This lava is gonna be
really hot! [screams]

44:50.000 --> 44:53.000
[grunting]

44:56.000 --> 44:57.000
[sighs]

45:03.000 --> 45:05.000
[Lola] [sighs] I...

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
I failed.

45:08.000 --> 45:12.000
A warrior is judged
not only by her skills,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
but by her values.

45:14.000 --> 45:17.000
You are now an Amazon.

45:17.000 --> 45:19.000
-[crowd cheering]
-I am?

45:19.000 --> 45:20.000
I am!

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
Now, go with your friends.

45:22.000 --> 45:25.000
Help them win
this battle of the baskets.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.000
I will help you
deliver justice

45:27.000 --> 45:29.000
to the one they call Al G.,

45:29.000 --> 45:31.000
and save the son of The Bron.

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
-Hey, guys!
-[Tune Squad] Lola!

45:34.000 --> 45:35.000
Hi, Lola.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.000
[Lola] Good to see you!

45:36.000 --> 45:37.000
Yo, Bugs, you coming?

45:37.000 --> 45:39.000
[upbeat music playing]

45:40.000 --> 45:43.000
Wouldn't miss it
for the world.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.000
-Yeah, Bugs! Here we go.
-[Bugs Bunny gasps]

45:50.000 --> 45:51.000
[Dom] Nah, nah.

45:52.000 --> 45:54.000
Oh, I got the ball. Let's go.

45:54.000 --> 45:55.000
-No.
-I got you now.

45:55.000 --> 45:57.000
[Dom] Oh. Ah.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
[announcer]  Dunk-tastic!

45:58.000 --> 46:01.000
-You dunked on me? Man...
-[chuckles]

46:01.000 --> 46:04.000
I still can't believe you made
this by yourself, Dom.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.000
I mean,
people need to see this.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.000
You're not just a prince,
you're a wizard.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.000
Come here.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.000
Wow.

46:15.000 --> 46:16.000
[Dom] That's Diana Taurasi.

46:17.000 --> 46:18.000
[Al G.] How'd you build her?

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
-[Anthony Davis] Yo, Dame!
-What's good, bro?

46:20.000 --> 46:21.000
[Dom]  Dad hooked me up
with some of his friends

46:21.000 --> 46:23.000
at an NBA charity event.

46:23.000 --> 46:25.000
I thought
maybe they could help me

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
with the character designs
for my game.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.000
Game?

46:28.000 --> 46:29.000
Yeah, I'm building
a video game.

46:29.000 --> 46:30.000
Okay.

46:30.000 --> 46:31.000
You know you're gonna
need a shooter,

46:31.000 --> 46:33.000
-and I'm that dude, so...
-Wait a minute.

46:33.000 --> 46:35.000
I'm next, because if Klay's
in it, then I'm in it.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.000
Hey, if I'm gonna be
in this game,

46:36.000 --> 46:38.000
I need a superpower
or something.

46:38.000 --> 46:39.000
Between me and you,

46:39.000 --> 46:42.000
I need one of those
special modes.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
And we can call it
"Dame Time."

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
-[all speaking at once]
-Nah, time's up. Time's up.

46:46.000 --> 46:48.000
You guys can be
whatever you want.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.000
[hip-hop music playing]

46:54.000 --> 46:56.000
[Dom]  It was great.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
They really helped me out.

46:58.000 --> 47:00.000
Stored all the scans
right on my phone.

47:01.000 --> 47:02.000
This phone?

47:05.000 --> 47:06.000
[gasps softly]

47:07.000 --> 47:09.000
So, theoretically,
this app of yours

47:09.000 --> 47:12.000
can scan people in
from anywhere in the world,

47:12.000 --> 47:14.000
using their own phones.

47:14.000 --> 47:15.000
Yeah, I guess.

47:15.000 --> 47:17.000
That is sick. [chuckles]

47:17.000 --> 47:18.000
Pete!

47:18.000 --> 47:19.000
-[babbles]
-Check this out.

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
Make sure he gets it
back though, it's his.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.000
And respect his privacy.

47:24.000 --> 47:25.000
[speaks robot]

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
[sighs]

47:33.000 --> 47:34.000
[in English]
Gotta say, though,

47:34.000 --> 47:37.000
it's really a shame that
your dad doesn't support you.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
I mean, I get it.

47:41.000 --> 47:44.000
He's one of the greatest
of all time at what he does.

47:44.000 --> 47:45.000
Well, the jury's still out
on that, I think,

47:45.000 --> 47:46.000
but go ahead.

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
And I... build video games.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.000
Mmm.

47:53.000 --> 47:54.000
I think he doesn't...

47:57.000 --> 47:59.000
He won't let me do me.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
He won't let me be me.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.000
I'd let you be you.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.000
You know what?

48:09.000 --> 48:11.000
I think I know a way
we can fix this.

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
We're gonna
make your dad stand up

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
and take notice of you,
young prince.

48:15.000 --> 48:16.000
[music playing]

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
[moaning]

48:18.000 --> 48:20.000
[energy powering up]

48:27.000 --> 48:28.000
[babbles]

48:36.000 --> 48:37.000
[whistle blows]

48:38.000 --> 48:40.000
Ball.

48:40.000 --> 48:42.000
I need us to focus
so we can beat this Al G. guy,

48:42.000 --> 48:44.000
and I can get my son back.

48:44.000 --> 48:46.000
I'm coach,
I'll take it from here.

48:46.000 --> 48:49.000
The dictionary
defines basketball

48:49.000 --> 48:50.000
[high-pitched] as a game

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
played between
two teams of five.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.000
Uh, look here, Cleveland.

48:53.000 --> 48:55.000
We got a certain way
of doing things around here.

48:55.000 --> 48:57.000
[LeBron] Let's start
with the basics.

48:57.000 --> 48:59.000
Lola, show 'em how we do it.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
[Daffy] You're despicable.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
[grunts]
Simplest shot in the game.

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
-Sufferin' succotash!
-Oh, wow!

49:05.000 --> 49:06.000
[LeBron] Nice layup.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.000
That's fundamental basketball.

49:07.000 --> 49:08.000
[in normal voice]
Fundamental basketball.

49:08.000 --> 49:10.000
That's what I've been saying.

49:10.000 --> 49:11.000
Sam, shoot the ball.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.000
Let's try that again,
shall we?

49:18.000 --> 49:20.000
-[whistle blows]
-[upbeat music playing]

49:21.000 --> 49:22.000
Ooh!

49:22.000 --> 49:24.000
-Come back here, you.
-[chuckles]

49:25.000 --> 49:26.000
Whoo-hoo!

49:28.000 --> 49:29.000
-[Sylvester gasps]
-What the...?

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
I say, I say, hi-ho, Silver!

49:33.000 --> 49:34.000
Yee-haw!

49:36.000 --> 49:37.000
Ow!

49:39.000 --> 49:41.000
[upbeat music continues]

49:43.000 --> 49:45.000
-[Porky stutters] Ball hogs.
-[screams]

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Hey! I'm open!

49:47.000 --> 49:49.000
[Porky laughs wickedly]

49:49.000 --> 49:51.000
Go, Tunes!

49:52.000 --> 49:53.000
Here I go.

49:54.000 --> 49:56.000
[shouts in Spanish]

49:57.000 --> 49:59.000
-[grunting]
-Taz, no!

50:01.000 --> 50:03.000
Whoa!

50:03.000 --> 50:04.000
[Speedy]  Ay! Diablo loco!

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
Let me show you how it's done.
Three-point land!

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
[engine revving]

50:14.000 --> 50:15.000
Where'd she get the ramp?

50:18.000 --> 50:21.000
In your face!

50:21.000 --> 50:23.000
This isn't real basketball.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
[Bugs Bunny]
You're right. But it's fun!

50:25.000 --> 50:28.000
You remember fun,
don't you, Doc?

50:28.000 --> 50:31.000
Game, Blouses! What?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.000
You lost LeBron James?

50:36.000 --> 50:39.000
And his son? For real?

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
You better find that dude.
He on my fantasy team.

50:42.000 --> 50:43.000
I didn't lose LeBron,

50:43.000 --> 50:45.000
-so stop saying that!
-[cell phone ringing]

50:46.000 --> 50:47.000
Oh, come on, man.

50:47.000 --> 50:50.000
Listen, his wife keeps calling
me every ten minutes.

50:50.000 --> 50:51.000
Now, I gotta get back
to her soon

50:51.000 --> 50:52.000
or she gonna kill me, man.

50:52.000 --> 50:55.000
Look, does my name badge say,
"LeBron Finder"?

50:55.000 --> 50:58.000
"LeBron Locator"?
No, it doesn't.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.000
But isn't it your job
to secure something?

51:00.000 --> 51:01.000
With all due respect,

51:01.000 --> 51:02.000
I went to school
for six months

51:02.000 --> 51:05.000
to be accredited
as a security specialist,

51:05.000 --> 51:07.000

in the securial arts.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.000
And the sooner
you come to terms

51:09.000 --> 51:11.000
with the fact that you lost
the world's greatest athlete,

51:12.000 --> 51:13.000
the sooner you'll be able
to move on with your life.

51:14.000 --> 51:15.000
I'm a professional!
An avid professional, man!

51:15.000 --> 51:17.000
-[cell phone ringing]
-I ain't lose LeBron,

51:17.000 --> 51:18.000
and I ain't ask you
about your...

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Hey, Kamiyah.

51:19.000 --> 51:21.000
Yeah, I got the funniest story
to tell you.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.000
Oh, snap!
I gotta call you back.

51:23.000 --> 51:25.000
I'm driving through a canyon
right now.

51:25.000 --> 51:26.000
He ain't in no canyon.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.000
He in my office,
violating my personal space!

51:28.000 --> 51:29.000
I'm driving through a canyon

business and find LeBron.

-Malik.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.000
You have zero seconds
to tell me

51:37.000 --> 51:39.000
where my husband
and my son are.

51:39.000 --> 51:40.000
[Al G.] Okay, young prince,

your character.

51:43.000 --> 51:45.000
[Dom] Al, have you
done this before?

51:45.000 --> 51:47.000
[Al G.] Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

51:47.000 --> 51:49.000
I upgrade things all the time.

51:49.000 --> 51:51.000
I mean, look at Pete,
for instance.

51:51.000 --> 51:53.000
He was hideous, now he's
adorable. Right, Pete?

51:53.000 --> 51:56.000
-[Pete cooing]
-Ugh. Don't...

51:56.000 --> 51:59.000
Don't look at Pete, okay?
Just focus on yourself.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.000
That's the character
customization menu

52:07.000 --> 52:08.000
from my game.

52:08.000 --> 52:11.000
Yes, it is. Now, with this,

52:11.000 --> 52:12.000
you can become the player

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
that your dad
always wanted you to be.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
Best part is,
you get to do it your way.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.000
You have control.

52:18.000 --> 52:20.000
[blows]

52:32.000 --> 52:35.000
Seventy-five?
You're good with 75?

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Come on! We didn't come here
to be three-quarters.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.000
Pete's a 75,
he can't even rebound.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.000
[exclaims, grumbles]

52:41.000 --> 52:43.000
Come on, Dom. Let's go.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.000
Dream big, son. Turn up.

52:48.000 --> 52:50.000
Turn up.

53:17.000 --> 53:19.000
-[Dom] Wait, wait, wait...
-Running man on 'em. Huh?

53:19.000 --> 53:22.000
You said we were rebuilding
my character.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.000
You never said anything

53:23.000 --> 53:25.000
about me
actually playing in the game.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
Look, do you want your dad
to respect you or not?

53:27.000 --> 53:29.000
-Yeah, but...
-No, Dom. No buts.

53:31.000 --> 53:33.000
[in distorted voice] You want
your dad to respect you,

53:33.000 --> 53:36.000
you beat him in a game
of your own creation.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.000
Dads don't understand
reason, Dom.

53:39.000 --> 53:40.000
They understand power.

53:41.000 --> 53:43.000
You take the power.

53:43.000 --> 53:45.000
You gotta make him
respect you.

53:45.000 --> 53:48.000
You make him see
that you are special.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.000
Do it. Upgrade me.

Yo! I got handles!

54:41.000 --> 54:43.000
You got mad handles.

54:43.000 --> 54:45.000
There's no way
we're gonna get beat now.

54:46.000 --> 54:49.000
Hey, how about we show
your teammates some love?

54:49.000 --> 54:51.000

no rules, okay?

54:57.000 --> 54:59.000
Forget about fundamentals.

54:59.000 --> 55:03.000
Okay. I think I can make
a few customizations.

It's almost like...

55:26.000 --> 55:27.000
It's almost like they were
abducted, all right?

55:27.000 --> 55:29.000
What?

55:29.000 --> 55:30.000
Now, we gotta rule out
all possibilities here.

Weird.

55:51.000 --> 55:52.000
[Malik] I just had
a thought, okay?

55:52.000 --> 55:54.000
Now, if he's tweeting
from his phone right now,

55:54.000 --> 55:55.000
then that means you can...

55:55.000 --> 55:58.000
I can track him on my phone.

That's what I was gonna say.

I'm playing for. My family.

I say, I say, how in the world

1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000
did he get
all these spectators here?

1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:58.000
I don't know, but the line

1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:00.000
for the bathroom's
gonna be insane.

1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:07.000
And we're back
from commercial and...

1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000
Where are we?

1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:10.000
Lil Rel?

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:12.000
[chuckling] Man,
what are you doing here?

1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:14.000
Wait, Ernie Johnson?
This is crazy!

1:02:14.000 --> 1:02:16.000
Look, I was
on my phone, right,

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:18.000
and I was getting
on the elevator...

1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:20.000
Wait a minute, did I fall down
the elevator shaft?

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:22.000
Ernie, are we dead?

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.000
Is this
what heaven looks like?

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:26.000
No, it looks like
we're in some kinda

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000
computer-generated
basketball game.

1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:30.000
[cell phone chimes]

1:02:32.000 --> 1:02:34.000
It looks like
Dad's game's starting.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:36.000
What? Let me see that.

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:37.000
[Al G. on speakers]
Oh, Bron, Bron.

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000
[Kamiyah] Who's this guy?

1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000
[in sing-song voice]
Got some VIPs coming in.

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:43.000
No!

1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:44.000
[in distorted voice] Yeah!

1:02:44.000 --> 1:02:48.000
[laughs] What a twist!

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:49.000
No, we shouldn't
be watching that.

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000
[Kamiyah] Where is he?
Where is this coming from?

1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:53.000
[Malik] Something's
not right here.

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000
[electricity crackling]

1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:58.000
[Al G. on speakers]
It's game time!

1:02:58.000 --> 1:02:59.000
[Kamiyah] What?

1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:00.000
[Kamiyah yelps]

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000
Whoa, what in the world?

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:09.000
Mommy, what just happened?

1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000
Oh, my God! Kids!

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:12.000
Bron!

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.000
[both grunt]

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:16.000
[Kamiyah gasps]

1:03:16.000 --> 1:03:18.000
Babe, what is going on?
Where's Dom?

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000
I don't know, but I have to go
to play this game

1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:21.000
-to save everyone with...
-Bugs Bunny?

1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:24.000
Uh... [smacks lips]
What's up, Doc?

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:26.000
[yowls]

1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000
That's kinda normal
around here.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:32.000
Dad, this is Dom's game.
You know how to play, right?

1:03:32.000 --> 1:03:34.000
It's basketball. Of course!

1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000
Yeah.

1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000
[Al G.]  Uh, excuse me?
Paging Mr. LeBron James!

1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:40.000
Everything's
gonna be all right.

1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000
-[Al G. laughs]
-I promise.

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:43.000
[sighs deeply]

1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:46.000
Zap me into you.

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000
[Siri]  Sorry,
I didn't understand that.

1:03:48.000 --> 1:03:51.000
I said, zap me, into you.

1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:54.000
Zap me, human,
into you, phone.

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:56.000
Zap me.

1:03:56.000 --> 1:03:58.000
[hip-hop music playing]

1:03:58.000 --> 1:04:00.000
[announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000
please give a warm welcome
to your host for the evening,

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000
-Mr. Al G. Rhythm!
-[crowd cheering]

1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000
[Al G.]  Hey, how y'all doing?

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:10.000
Thank you!

1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:11.000
-Thank you very much!
-[music stops]

1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000
Ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls,

1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:19.000
welcome to the first and final
Serververse Classic!

1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000
[crowd cheering]

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000
[grand orchestral
music playing]

1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:26.000
Oh! Let me tell you what.

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:29.000
I know that you all
are LeBron's biggest fans.

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.000
And the King has had
a great run, hasn't he?

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:35.000
But that's over.
That's done now.

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:38.000
And it is time for a new king
to take the throne.

1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:40.000
This dude is a hater.

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:41.000
Haters gonna hate.

1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000
-He's a bad guy.
-[LeBron] Big time.

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000
[Al G.]  So let's lay down
some basic ground rules.

1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000
If King James wins,

1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:51.000
you all get to go back
to your regular, boring lives.

1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000
But if my team wins,

1:04:54.000 --> 1:04:58.000
you all get to stay with me
in the Serververse

1:04:58.000 --> 1:05:00.000
-forever.
-[crowd exclaims]

1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:01.000
[fans] What?

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:02.000
[Al G.]  How 'bout that, huh?

1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:04.000
What? That wasn't the deal.

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:07.000
[Al G.]  Oh, yeah! Didn't see
that coming, did you?

1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.000
Well, at least we're good.

1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:10.000
Oh, boy.

1:05:10.000 --> 1:05:11.000
Oh, and I almost forgot,
all of the Tunes

1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:13.000
will be deleted, so...
[blows raspberry]

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000
[Elmer] Oh, no!

1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:16.000
-[Sylvester] Deleted?
-[Speedy] That is messed up!

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:18.000
-[Foghorn] That dude is bad.
-[Granny] Why?

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:20.000
You just couldn't keep
your big beak shut.

1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:22.000
-[grunts]
-Blabbermouth.

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.000
I deserved that.

1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:27.000
And now, from the beautiful
mind of Dominic James...

1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000
Introducing...

1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:30.000
the Goon Squad!

1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.000
Whoo!

1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000
[rap music playing]

1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000
White Mamba!

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.000
What's up?

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000
Wet ball, baby!

1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:42.000
[Al G.]  Wet Fire!

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:47.000
[grunts]

1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000
[Al G.]  Arachnneka!

1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:53.000
Queen of the web. Mwah.

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:57.000
-[birds screech]
-[rap music continues]

1:06:00.000 --> 1:06:01.000
[Al G.]  And The Brow.

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:03.000
Flyest guy on the squad.

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:04.000
[LeBron] Dang!

1:06:04.000 --> 1:06:06.000
What'd they do to my boy, AD?

1:06:06.000 --> 1:06:07.000
[Al G.]  And this next young

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.000
man I'm bringing up...

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:12.000
Oh, my goodness.
Y'all gonna love him.

1:06:12.000 --> 1:06:14.000
He puts the G in genius.

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.000
He's my hero
on the ones and zeroes,

1:06:16.000 --> 1:06:19.000
Mr. Dominic James!
[holds note]

1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:21.000
[hip-hop music playing]

1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000
[crowd cheering]

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:38.000
[announcer]  Dom!

1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000
[hip-hop music
continues playing]

1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000
[crowd continues cheering]

1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:54.000
[Al G.]  Give it up one more
time for Dominic James!

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:55.000
[Kamiyah] Dom!

1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:58.000
Dom!

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:00.000
I don't think he can hear you.

1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:03.000
I'm his mother.
He better hear me.

1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000
Dom!

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:09.000
-Whoa.
-Right? It's amazing.

1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000
All these people came here
to see you, Dom.

1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:14.000
And we used your scanning tech
to make it happen.

1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:15.000
Check 'em out.

1:07:16.000 --> 1:07:18.000
This is dope.

1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:19.000
-Dom.
-[Dom] Dad!

1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000
[LeBron] Are you okay, son?

1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:22.000
I've never been better.

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000
Listen to me.
Everyone in here is in danger.

1:07:24.000 --> 1:07:26.000
[scoffs] Come on, Dad.

1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:28.000
Why you gotta make everything
so serious?

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000
This is serious.
Your boy Al G.,

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:31.000
-he's a bad dude.
-What?

1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000
He's using your game
to trap everyone in here.

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:37.000
He's not bad. He's just sad
because he works so hard

1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000
and no one pays
attention to him.

1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:40.000
He's like me, Dad.

1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:42.000
No, he's nothing like you.
He's manipulating you.

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:44.000
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:07:44.000 --> 1:07:45.000
Why you using
all these charged words...

1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:48.000
Deleted. Manipulate...
[whispers] Kidnapped.

1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:50.000
Come on, LeBron, chill out.

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:51.000
What'd you say, man?

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000
I'm playing basketball.
I thought you'd be happy.

1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:54.000
Thought you'd be happy.

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:56.000
Yeah, you keep it up,

1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.000
you ain't gonna get
that Father's Day card.

1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:58.000
Those things
are not guaranteed.

1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:00.000
-Dom.
-[Al G.] Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:03.000
[The Brow] You going down,
King James.

1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000
What's good, baby? [kisses]

1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:06.000
Hey, yo, Brow,

1:08:06.000 --> 1:08:07.000
I think it's time
for your eyebrows

1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:09.000
to break up with each other.

1:08:10.000 --> 1:08:11.000
Oh?

1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:14.000
They ugly. Let it go.

1:08:14.000 --> 1:08:16.000
What he mean?
What's wrong with 'em?

1:08:16.000 --> 1:08:19.000
We'll show him who's boss.

1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:20.000
What did he say, Bron?

1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:23.000
He thinks Al G. is his friend.
I don't know what else to do.

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:28.000
You gotta win this game...

1:08:30.000 --> 1:08:33.000
and get our son back.

1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:36.000
Okay.

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000
[announcer]  It's game time!

1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000
[upbeat hip-hop music playing]

1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000
[fanfare music plays]

1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:02.000
[Pete hums along to end note]

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000
Pete's the referee?

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:07.000
Oh, you mad, bro? [laughs]

1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:08.000
[whistle blows]

1:09:08.000 --> 1:09:09.000
[crowd cheering]

1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000
[Ernie] Look,
I don't want to alarm you

1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:12.000
or any of our viewers,

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:13.000
but apparently,

1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:15.000
if the Tune Squad
doesn't win this game,

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000
we're all gonna be
trapped here forever.

1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000
[chuckles] Luckily
the Tune Squad got

1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000
the four-time MVP LeBron James
on their team.

1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000
I ain't sweating it.

1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000
[upbeat hip-hop music playing]

1:09:28.000 --> 1:09:29.000
[cooing]

1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:38.000
-[crowd exclaims]
-Oh, we doomed. We're doomed!

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.000
You gotta be kidding me.

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000
[Lil Rel] Did you see
that kid fly?

1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:43.000
[Ernie] Uh-huh.

1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000
He's like Superman,
but with a hi-top fade.

1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:48.000
[grunts]

1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:55.000
[Ernie] Rel, I gotta tell you,

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:59.000
this Goon Squad is loaded,
top to bottom.

1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000
Bugs Bunny is gonna need
a rabbit's foot

1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000
against this guy, Wet Fire.

1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:06.000
Oh! Because he's wet,
and he's fire.

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:08.000
[chuckles]
That's kinda brilliant.

1:10:08.000 --> 1:10:11.000
-Whoop. Oh. Whoop. Ha-ha.
-[Lola] What?

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:15.000
-Gimme that ball!
-Back off, rabbit.

1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000
[Wet Fire] Entering
the Splash Zone! Ha-ha!

1:10:20.000 --> 1:10:22.000
[Ernie] And you know
what else is brilliant?

1:10:22.000 --> 1:10:24.000
This ball movement, man.
Check it out.

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:26.000
[Sylvester]
Sufferin' succotash!

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.000
Leading!

1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:28.000

1:27:24.000 --> 1:27:26.000
[Ernie] Look out.

1:27:26.000 --> 1:27:27.000
Looks like Wile E.'s
gotten himself

1:27:27.000 --> 1:27:29.000
mixed up in the machine.

1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:42.000
[beeping]

1:27:44.000 --> 1:27:45.000
[Ernie] And just like that,

1:27:45.000 --> 1:27:48.000
the Tunes have a thousand
points on the board.

1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:49.000
We havin' fun yet?

1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:53.000
[Ernie] They're gonna clean
these coyotes off the court

1:27:53.000 --> 1:27:55.000
-and keep the game going.
-[laughs]

1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.000
What's wrong, Al?
That was awesome.

1:27:57.000 --> 1:27:58.000
What do you mean,
"What's wrong?"

1:27:58.000 --> 1:27:59.000
They're catching up.

1:27:59.000 --> 1:28:01.000
[in distorted voice]
Run Dame Time.

1:28:05.000 --> 1:28:07.000
Not him again.

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:09.000
[stutters] He's gonna
make bacon out of us.

1:28:09.000 --> 1:28:12.000
Oh, don't worry.
Time's on our side.

1:28:16.000 --> 1:28:21.000
She knows time is literally
on their side, right?

1:28:21.000 --> 1:28:22.000
[walker squeaking]

1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:24.000
[grunts]

1:28:24.000 --> 1:28:25.000
You sure about this, Granny?

1:28:25.000 --> 1:28:28.000
I'm going old-school
on his butt.

1:28:34.000 --> 1:28:35.000
-Whoa.
-[crowd cheering]

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:45.000
Come on.

1:28:47.000 --> 1:28:49.000
-[crowd gasps]
-Stop!

1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:56.000
-[beeping]
-Tick-tock.

1:28:59.000 --> 1:29:01.000
-[grunts weakly]
-Hyah!

1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:06.000
-[crowd cheering]
-She is The One.

1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:12.000
What in the AARP
is going on out here?

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000
I got hops! Whoo!

1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:18.000
[digital trilling]

1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:19.000
Lola!

1:29:19.000 --> 1:29:20.000
Got you, Bron!

1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:33.000
[yelling]

1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:41.000
[screaming]

1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:44.000
[all groan]

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:46.000
-[crowd cheering]
-There we go! Let's go!

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:48.000
[Ernie] And the Tunes
take the lead!

1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:51.000
What a play from Lola
and LeBron James!

1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:53.000
-A monster jam!
-[chuckling]

1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:56.000
LeBron came back
from three-one down.

1:29:56.000 --> 1:29:58.000
Can he come back
from this far back?

1:29:58.000 --> 1:30:00.000
Let me tell you this,
I woke up today

1:30:00.000 --> 1:30:01.000
and only knew one world.

1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:04.000
Then I got sucked into
my phone, and at this point,

1:30:04.000 --> 1:30:06.000
anything's possible!

1:30:06.000 --> 1:30:08.000
-[laughs]
-[LeBron shouts]

1:30:08.000 --> 1:30:09.000
-Way to go, Tunes!
-Let's go!

1:30:09.000 --> 1:30:10.000
Foghorn, right here.

1:30:10.000 --> 1:30:12.000
-Yeah!
-[LeBron] Yeah!

1:30:12.000 --> 1:30:13.000
-I say, that's all right!
-[LeBron] Lola!

1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:14.000
Yes! My dude!

1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:15.000
Taz!

1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:17.000
[LeBron cheering]

1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:19.000
-Go, baby! Yeah!
-Oh, yeah! Here we go!

1:30:19.000 --> 1:30:21.000
[Foghorn] Way to go,
Tune Squad!

1:30:21.000 --> 1:30:22.000
[LeBron] Yeah!
That's what I'm talking about!

1:30:22.000 --> 1:30:25.000
Now we having some fun! Yeah!

1:30:25.000 --> 1:30:27.000
Whoo-hoo! This is
fun basketball right here!

1:30:28.000 --> 1:30:30.000
-Be yourselves! Be yourselves!
-[Elmer] All right!

1:30:30.000 --> 1:30:33.000
Hey, Dom, are you a Tune
or are you a Goon?

1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:34.000
Tune or Goon? Tune or Goon?

1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:36.000
Make up your mind.
Make up your mind.

1:30:36.000 --> 1:30:38.000
Let's go. Sit down.

1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:40.000
Yeah. Way to get looney
out there.

1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:42.000
-[Granny cheers, laughs]
-Ooh-whee!

1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:44.000
[Tweety] We did it!

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:48.000
Everybody happy, huh?

1:30:48.000 --> 1:30:50.000
Everybody having
a good time? Yeah?

1:30:50.000 --> 1:30:51.000
You having a lot of fun
out there?

1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:53.000
'Cause that's all
that matters, right?

1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:54.000
Is that you're having fun.

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:55.000
[yelling]
That doesn't matter at all!

1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:58.000
What matters is that
I win this [bleep] game!

1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:00.000
Oh, and you, Dom.

1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:03.000
How are you losing
at your own game?

1:31:03.000 --> 1:31:04.000
[in distorted voice]
For server's sake,

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:06.000
I didn't even think
that was possible!

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.000
I expected a lot more
out of you, son.

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:11.000
Get your head in the game.
I need to win!

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:12.000
[Foghorn] All right!

1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:14.000
[Yosemite Sam]
Whoo-hoo! Yee-haw!

1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:15.000
[Granny] Drinks on me!

1:31:15.000 --> 1:31:17.000
[Sylvester]
Boy, that was awesome!

1:31:17.000 --> 1:31:18.000
[Porky] Go team!

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:20.000
[Al G. sighs]

1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:23.000
[in normal voice] Yeah, maybe
your dad was right about you.

1:31:23.000 --> 1:31:26.000
Letting you be you
was a mistake.

1:31:26.000 --> 1:31:28.000
[sad music playing]

1:31:30.000 --> 1:31:31.000
-[thud]
-Okay.

1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:33.000
If everybody would move down,

1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:35.000
then we could all sit
on the bench.

1:31:35.000 --> 1:31:37.000
Let's all sit on the bench!

1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:39.000
[Foghorn] Now that's what
I call momentum, son.

1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:41.000
-[Lola] LeBron?
-[Tweety] Way to go!

1:31:41.000 --> 1:31:42.000
Hey, you with us?

1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:44.000
[Porky] I'm so tickled.

1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:48.000
Let's end this.

1:31:48.000 --> 1:31:50.000
I'm getting my son back.

1:31:58.000 --> 1:31:59.000
[buzzer sounds]

1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:01.000
[inspirational music playing]

1:32:02.000 --> 1:32:04.000
[Elmer pants, grunts]

1:32:05.000 --> 1:32:07.000
[grunts]

1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:09.000
[Elmer panting]

1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:12.000
[suspenseful music playing]

1:32:16.000 --> 1:32:17.000
I wonder what move
he's gonna do.

1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:18.000
The post-up?

1:32:18.000 --> 1:32:19.000
Maybe the fadeaway.

1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:22.000
He's gonna dunk all over him.

1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.000
Look at that kid!
Kid's too small.

1:32:27.000 --> 1:32:28.000
[music stops]

1:32:31.000 --> 1:32:32.000
Dad, what are you doing?

1:32:33.000 --> 1:32:34.000
We're in the middle of a game.

1:32:35.000 --> 1:32:37.000
Hey, what's goin' on?

1:32:37.000 --> 1:32:38.000
I don't know.

1:32:40.000 --> 1:32:41.000
[Dom] Dad...

1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:48.000
Dom, your game
is amazing, son.

1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:50.000
But I guess
I would've known that

1:32:50.000 --> 1:32:51.000
if I would've listened more.

1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:53.000
Sorry I didn't.

1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:55.000
For me, when I was a kid,

1:32:55.000 --> 1:32:58.000
the things that I went through
to get where I am now,

1:32:58.000 --> 1:33:01.000
I had to be a certain way.
[sighs]

1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:03.000
Yeah, it helped me win games,

1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:07.000
but not so much being a dad.

1:33:09.000 --> 1:33:13.000
I'm still learning how.
You're teaching me.

1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:16.000
I want you to be yourself.

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:21.000
Do you understand
how much I love you?

1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:25.000
Do you understand
how important you are to me?

1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:29.000
How very special you are?

1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:34.000
I mean, I don't even know
if I'm saying this right.

1:33:34.000 --> 1:33:35.000
[ball bounces off]

1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:43.000
Sounds right to me.

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.000
[tender music playing]

1:33:50.000 --> 1:33:52.000
I love you, Dad.

1:33:53.000 --> 1:33:54.000
I love you too, son.

1:33:56.000 --> 1:33:58.000
[crowd applauding]

1:34:02.000 --> 1:34:05.000
-Oh, now, that's beautiful.
-[Granny] Let's go!

1:34:05.000 --> 1:34:07.000
[Yosemite Sam] Whoo!

1:34:07.000 --> 1:34:09.000
I think I'm gonna cry.

1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:10.000
Not me.

1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:12.000
[wailing]

1:34:12.000 --> 1:34:14.000
Bugs, pull it together.

1:34:15.000 --> 1:34:16.000
[Kamiyah] Dom!

1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.000
Dom!

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:23.000
[Dom] Mom!

1:34:23.000 --> 1:34:25.000
Hey, Xosha!

1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:26.000
[Al G.] Are you serious?

1:34:29.000 --> 1:34:30.000
[in distorted voice] Zip it!

1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000
[crowd quiets]

1:34:32.000 --> 1:34:34.000
You two are a joke,
you know that?

1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:36.000
I got this, Dad.

1:34:36.000 --> 1:34:38.000
[in normal voice] Oh, what?
You got something to say?

1:34:38.000 --> 1:34:40.000
Yeah.

1:34:40.000 --> 1:34:42.000
I think you want people to
fear you more than anything.

1:34:42.000 --> 1:34:44.000
And I'm not about that, Al G.

1:34:44.000 --> 1:34:46.000
I'm playing with my dad.

1:34:46.000 --> 1:34:48.000
First of all, it's Mr. Rhythm
to you, you little traitor.

1:34:48.000 --> 1:34:50.000
Second of all, you're not.

1:34:50.000 --> 1:34:51.000
You're playing
against your dad.

1:34:51.000 --> 1:34:53.000
See what this says?
"Goon Squad."

1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:55.000
You already
made your choice, Dom.

1:34:55.000 --> 1:34:56.000
Right, Pete? He can't...

1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.000
-[whimpering]
-Pete, are you crying?

1:34:59.000 --> 1:35:01.000
There's no crying
in the Serververse, Pete!

1:35:01.000 --> 1:35:03.000
[Al G. scoffs]

1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.000
All right. Yeah, all right.

1:35:05.000 --> 1:35:07.000
I see how it is, Dom.

1:35:07.000 --> 1:35:08.000
[in distorted voice]
I see how it is.

1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:10.000
I gave you everything!

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:12.000
I say, I say,
good to have you, son.

1:35:12.000 --> 1:35:13.000
Great spot for you
right here, kid.

1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:14.000
[Yosemite Sam] We got 'em now!

1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:15.000
[Speedy]  Bienvenido, senorito!

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:17.000
Somebody get him a new jersey.

1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:18.000
[Elmer] Welcome to the hunt.

1:35:18.000 --> 1:35:19.000
Sufferin' succotash!

1:35:19.000 --> 1:35:21.000
I made this, just in case.

1:35:21.000 --> 1:35:22.000
Thanks, Granny.

1:35:22.000 --> 1:35:24.000
Eh. What's up, Dom?

1:35:24.000 --> 1:35:25.000
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

1:35:25.000 --> 1:35:26.000
Here you go, Dom.

1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:28.000
[Tweety] Really glad
to have you on the team!

1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:29.000
[Dom] Thanks, Dad.

1:35:29.000 --> 1:35:30.000
[Al G.] Fine.

1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:34.000
You wanna join these losers?

1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:36.000
You go ahead, Dom.

1:35:36.000 --> 1:35:39.000
'Cause it's not your game
anymore.

1:35:39.000 --> 1:35:41.000
[in distorted voice]
I am the game.

1:35:41.000 --> 1:35:45.000
King Kong
ain't got nothin' on me!

1:35:45.000 --> 1:35:46.000
[King Kong gasps, grunts]

1:35:47.000 --> 1:35:49.000
[trilling]

1:36:00.000 --> 1:36:02.000
-Did you see that?
-Uh-huh.

1:36:02.000 --> 1:36:04.000
The man just grew,
like, five feet.

1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:06.000
[distorted laugh]

1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:10.000
[in distorted voice] Yo, King.

1:36:10.000 --> 1:36:13.000
You're about to lose
your family, your friends,

1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.000
those Tunes,

1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000
everything you love.

1:36:17.000 --> 1:36:18.000
I don't think so.

1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.000
Oh, it's on.

1:36:23.000 --> 1:36:26.000
[crowd cheering]

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:27.000
[stirring music playing]

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.000
Count it!

1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:32.000
[beeping]

1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:33.000
[crowd cheering]

1:36:33.000 --> 1:36:34.000
Yeah, Lola!

1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:36.000
All right!

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.000
Nice pass, King!

1:36:37.000 --> 1:36:39.000
[crowd chanting]
Let's go, Tunes!

1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:40.000
Let's go, Tunes!

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:41.000
Let's go, Tunes!

1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:45.000
That's cute.
But I thought I told you...

1:36:50.000 --> 1:36:51.000
What?

1:36:51.000 --> 1:36:53.000
Ugh!

1:36:53.000 --> 1:36:55.000
...it's my game now.

1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:56.000
Yo, yo, switching everything.

1:36:56.000 --> 1:36:58.000
Yo', stay home. Bump out.

1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000
Sic 'em, Goons.

1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:04.000
[tense music playing]

1:37:04.000 --> 1:37:05.000
[crowd cheering]

1:37:06.000 --> 1:37:07.000
[bird screams]

1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:09.000
[LeBron] Get back, rabbit.

1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:10.000
Ow!

1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000
-Come here!
-[Lola grunts]

1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:13.000
[grunts]

1:37:13.000 --> 1:37:14.000
[grunting]

1:37:16.000 --> 1:37:17.000
[The Brow grunts]

1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:21.000
[dramatic music playing]

1:37:30.000 --> 1:37:32.000
[distorted grunting]

1:37:34.000 --> 1:37:36.000
[Al G.] Incoming!

1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:38.000
-[winces]
-[crowd exclaims]

1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:40.000
Whoo!

1:37:41.000 --> 1:37:43.000
I'm a monster!

1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000
We about to break
the internet, baby!

1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:48.000
It's over.

1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:50.000
Time out.

1:37:50.000 --> 1:37:52.000
-Oh, brother.
-[whistle blows]

1:37:53.000 --> 1:37:55.000
[Lola] Did you see that?

1:37:55.000 --> 1:37:56.000
He's cheating!

1:37:56.000 --> 1:37:59.000
Well, I say, I say,
that plain ol' sucks.

1:37:59.000 --> 1:38:00.000
Listen, it's all right.

1:38:00.000 --> 1:38:01.000
All we gotta do
is get one bucket.

1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:04.000
How can we score
if he controls the game, Doc?

1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:06.000
[Al G.] Whoa!
Where my Goons at?

1:38:06.000 --> 1:38:07.000
[White Mamba]
Right here, Coach!

1:38:07.000 --> 1:38:09.000
[Al G. chuckles,
sings indistinctly]

1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:11.000
[Al G.] No mercy!

1:38:11.000 --> 1:38:15.000
That no-good,
despicable son of a glitch!

1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:20.000
Yo! That's it!

1:38:20.000 --> 1:38:22.000
Your move, Dad. Remember?

1:38:22.000 --> 1:38:23.000
The step-back glitch.

1:38:23.000 --> 1:38:25.000
In and out, crossover,
step back, shoot.

1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:27.000
That move froze my whole game.

1:38:27.000 --> 1:38:28.000
[LeBron]
And that's good because...

1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:30.000
[Dom] If the game crashes,

1:38:30.000 --> 1:38:31.000
Al G. won't be able
to control it anymore.

1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000
And if he can't control it,

1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:34.000
he can't stop us
from scoring.

1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.000
[Dom] Right!

1:38:36.000 --> 1:38:38.000
-[Sylvester] Oh, boy!
-[Porky] Yeah! Yay!

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:40.000
Wait.

1:38:40.000 --> 1:38:42.000
-That's not gonna work.
-[LeBron] Why not?

1:38:42.000 --> 1:38:46.000
When my character did
the step-back, it got deleted.

1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.000
So, whoever does
the glitch move...

1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:51.000
-Will get deleted.
-[all gasp]

1:38:53.000 --> 1:38:56.000
So, I say, so I guess
we're drawing straws.

1:38:56.000 --> 1:38:59.000
We are not doing that.

1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:00.000
We'll think of something else.

1:39:00.000 --> 1:39:02.000
What about the old alley-oop?

1:39:02.000 --> 1:39:04.000
I'm gonna do the step-back.

1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:05.000
[all gasp]

1:39:05.000 --> 1:39:08.000
What? No.
Dad, you'll be deleted.

1:39:08.000 --> 1:39:09.000
I'm not
a video game character.

1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:11.000
I think I'll be okay.

1:39:11.000 --> 1:39:12.000
Dad, you don't know that.
I've done the calculations.

1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:13.000
[LeBron] Dom.

1:39:13.000 --> 1:39:15.000
Somebody's gotta do something.

1:39:15.000 --> 1:39:17.000
LeBron,
you don't have to do this.

1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:18.000
[all] No!

1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:19.000
Listen, just get me the ball.

1:39:20.000 --> 1:39:21.000
Hands in.

1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:27.000
Tune Squad on three.

1:39:27.000 --> 1:39:28.000
One, two, three...

1:39:28.000 --> 1:39:30.000
[all] Tune Squad!

1:39:32.000 --> 1:39:34.000
-[dramatic music playing]
-[crowd cheering]

1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:43.000
[The Brow] Here we go.

1:39:48.000 --> 1:39:50.000
Yeah, this is fun, huh?

1:39:50.000 --> 1:39:53.000
We should just do it again,
and again, and again.

1:39:53.000 --> 1:39:57.000
Just over, and over, and over
for all eternity.

1:40:00.000 --> 1:40:01.000
How's that sound?

1:40:01.000 --> 1:40:03.000
[Ernie] Ten seconds
on the clock.

1:40:03.000 --> 1:40:07.000
-[breathing heavily]
-The Tunes are one style point

1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:09.000
or defeat.

1:40:13.000 --> 1:40:15.000
[breathes deeply]

1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:17.000
[whistle blows]

1:40:18.000 --> 1:40:19.000
[both grunting]

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.000
[Ernie] This is
their last chance.

1:40:24.000 --> 1:40:26.000
Bugs, what are you doing?

1:40:26.000 --> 1:40:28.000
And it looks like
a broken play!

1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:32.000
In and out, crossover,
step back...

1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:34.000
[in slow motion] Bugs, no!

1:40:34.000 --> 1:40:37.000
[in slow motion] Shoot!

1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:38.000
[glitching]

1:40:38.000 --> 1:40:40.000
[inspirational music playing]

1:40:55.000 --> 1:40:57.000
[Ernie] Bugs' shot
is gonna be short.

1:41:02.000 --> 1:41:05.000
But wait, LeBron is flying
through the air!

1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:11.000
Come on, Dad.

1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:14.000
[music stops]

1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:19.000
Oh, no.

1:41:23.000 --> 1:41:24.000
He's not gonna make it.

1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000
He's... He's not...

1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:28.000
Gonna make it.

1:41:29.000 --> 1:41:30.000
No.

1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:53.000
That's cheating!

1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:56.000
[uplifting music playing]

1:42:05.000 --> 1:42:08.000

1:42:10.000 --> 1:42:12.000

1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:19.000
Great. Posterized.

-Yeah! Yes! Let's go!

1:42:28.000 --> 1:42:29.000
Whoo!

1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:31.000
We did it! Yeah!

1:42:31.000 --> 1:42:35.000
-Posterized. Yeah!
-Beep, beep.

The Tunes win!

-Unbelievable!
-[laughing]

1:42:41.000 --> 1:42:45.000
Al G. just got turned
into a literal poster.

1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:48.000
[sighs] This is not
how I wanted to go out!

1:42:48.000 --> 1:42:49.000

1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:51.000
-Yeah!
-I say, I say,

-that's all right!
-That's what I'm talkin' about!

No, no, no, no, no!

Hold on. No! No!

1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:57.000
[laughs]  Adios,  Goons!

1:42:57.000 --> 1:42:59.000
We won! Whoo-hoo! We won!

Give me a hug!

-I love y'all. Yeah, Tunes!

1:43:26.000 --> 1:43:28.000
Yes! I never doubted you
for a second, LeBron!

1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:31.000
We are going home!
Thank you so much!

1:43:31.000 --> 1:43:34.000
You are the Akron Hammer.
The chosen one!

1:43:34.000 --> 1:43:38.000
King James, man! I love you!

1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:56.000
[soft music playing]

1:43:58.000 --> 1:44:01.000
Bugs, that's the least looney
thing you've ever done.

1:44:01.000 --> 1:44:03.000
You got that right.

1:44:03.000 --> 1:44:07.000
But taking care of the people
you love is fundamental.

1:44:07.000 --> 1:44:08.000
Right, Doc?

1:44:11.000 --> 1:44:13.000
Thank you.

1:44:16.000 --> 1:44:17.000
Goodbye, Bron.

[all sniffling]

1:45:02.000 --> 1:45:04.000
We're all back together again.

1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:07.000
Bugs.

That's all, folks.

1:45:09.000 --> 1:45:12.000
[grand orchestral music

1:45:33.000 --> 1:45:35.000
-[LeBron] Son?
-Dad.

1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:42.000
-You're all right, right?
-I'm good.

1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:43.000
-You're sure?
-I'm good.

1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:45.000
All right, let's go home.

1:45:47.000 --> 1:45:48.000
Come here, boy.

1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:51.000
[Xosha] Daddy!

1:45:51.000 --> 1:45:53.000
-Baby, hi. Xosha, hey!
-Daddy!

-Baby!
-[Dom] Mom!

1:45:55.000 --> 1:45:56.000
-[LeBron] Missed y'all so much.
-[Darius] Bro,

1:45:56.000 --> 1:45:57.000
[Kamiyah] I'm so proud of you!

1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:59.000
All my family.

1:45:59.000 --> 1:46:00.000
My goodness.

1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:01.000
-I love you, guys.
-[Kamiyah] We love you, too.

1:46:01.000 --> 1:46:03.000
[LeBron] Come on, Malik.
Come on in, man.

1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:04.000
[Malik, tearfully]
You the Bron, man!

1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:05.000
It's a family affair, man.
Come on in.

1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:07.000
[Malik sobbing]
LeBron! LeBron.

1:46:07.000 --> 1:46:09.000
[LeBron] Hey, Malik, you good?

1:46:09.000 --> 1:46:10.000
No. No, man.

1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000
-[LeBron] You cryin'?
-[Malik] What?

1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:13.000
[LeBron] All right.

1:46:13.000 --> 1:46:14.000
-[Malik] I ain't crying, bruh.
-[LeBron] Okay.

1:46:20.000 --> 1:46:22.000
[LeBron] So, Dom,
you ready for basketball camp?

1:46:22.000 --> 1:46:24.000
[Dom] Yeah.
I'm actually pretty excited.

1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:26.000
[LeBron] Yeah? Because I know
how much you really wanted...

1:46:26.000 --> 1:46:27.000
[Dom] I think
I'mma just take a break

1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:29.000
from video games for now.

1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:31.000
You know, after we...

1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:33.000
Got sucked into one?

1:46:33.000 --> 1:46:34.000
Yeah.

1:46:34.000 --> 1:46:37.000
Really? Because, like...

1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:39.000
I mean, I feel like
I've made a mistake.

1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:42.000
I mean, we can turn around
right now if you want to.

1:46:42.000 --> 1:46:44.000
What are you talking about?

1:46:46.000 --> 1:46:47.000
Look.

1:46:56.000 --> 1:46:59.000
I mean, I figured it's
about time for you to do you.

1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:01.000
[Dom chuckles softly]

1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:02.000
-[chuckles]
-Thank you, Dad.

1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:04.000
You're welcome.

1:47:04.000 --> 1:47:06.000
Hey, man, have fun.

1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:09.000
Yo, Dom.

1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:11.000
Ball?

1:47:17.000 --> 1:47:18.000
I think I'mma hold onto it.

1:47:28.000 --> 1:47:30.000
Aw, that's so sweet.

1:47:31.000 --> 1:47:32.000
What's up, Doc?

1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:35.000
-Bugs! How did you...?
-Come on.

1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:38.000
You didn't think you'd get rid
of me that easily, did you?

1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:40.000
I told ya, I'm a Tune, Doc!

1:47:40.000 --> 1:47:42.000
I can survive anything!

1:47:42.000 --> 1:47:44.000
It's good to see you, buddy.

1:47:44.000 --> 1:47:46.000
Oh, by the way,
you think I could

1:47:46.000 --> 1:47:47.000
crash at your pad
for a few days?

1:47:47.000 --> 1:47:49.000
Of course. There's more
than enough room for you.

1:47:49.000 --> 1:47:51.000
Great! I've never been
to Tinseltown.

1:47:51.000 --> 1:47:52.000
I wanna go on a star tour.

1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:54.000
I hear they love
drinking juice here.

1:47:54.000 --> 1:47:56.000
Oh, do they make carrot juice?

1:47:56.000 --> 1:47:57.000
They juice anything
for you here.

1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.000
