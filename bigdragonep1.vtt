"Did I screw your brains out last night?"

00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:05.659
What's up?

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.750
Last night...

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.599
did you have fun?

00:01:08.851 --> 00:01:10.580
Fun, my ass.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.424
Last night was just...

00:01:11.424 --> 00:01:17.424
You were the one who asked for more, more, more and more, weren't you?

00:01:28.536 --> 00:01:31.296
It's been just a few hours ago.

00:01:31.296 --> 00:01:34.270
How could you not remember?

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:35.001
What a shame!

00:01:35.088 --> 00:01:37.372
Stop talking.

00:01:37.372 --> 00:01:38.852
And forget about last night.

00:01:38.852 --> 00:01:40.986
How could I?

00:01:40.986 --> 00:01:43.837
It was the hottest night of us two.

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:47.837
You could make a sexy face?

00:01:48.331 --> 00:01:51.331
I thought you could only make a fierce face.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.953
But in the video that you got, there's your face too.

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:59.760
I could always censor my face.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.409
Don't be so stupid.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.616
Can't you come up with that?

00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:07.616
You know, what you did was horrible.

00:02:09.106 --> 00:02:11.952
But I was onto it.

00:02:11.952 --> 00:02:14.362
Listen to me now.

00:02:14.362 --> 00:02:16.444
No matter what you do,

00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:19.844
you're never going to beat me.

00:02:19.844 --> 00:02:22.249
And about last night,

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.249
You won't be able to forget it.

00:02:28.403 --> 00:02:29.903
Hello? Hello?

00:03:01.852 --> 00:03:04.098
A legend says...

00:03:04.098 --> 00:03:07.023
in the ancient times, the Chinese people

00:03:07.023 --> 00:03:09.581
had given the four corners of the skies

00:03:09.581 --> 00:03:12.863
to the protection of the four divine creatures.

00:03:12.863 --> 00:03:14.352
Green Dragon.

00:03:14.352 --> 00:03:16.358
White Tiger.

00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:17.759
Red Phoenix.

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.566
And Black Turtoise.

00:03:19.566 --> 00:03:21.764
But in this legend,

00:03:21.764 --> 00:03:24.523
it's Mangkorn (dragon)

00:03:24.523 --> 00:03:25.607
and Yai.

00:03:25.607 --> 00:03:29.568
Two flirtatious guys,

00:03:29.568 --> 00:03:31.486
agressive,

00:03:31.486 --> 00:03:33.324
along the path,

00:03:33.324 --> 00:03:37.324
which would change my life and Mangkorn's forever.

00:04:09.778 --> 00:04:13.778
Yeah, yeah. That's it. That's a good shot.

00:04:14.146 --> 00:04:16.147
Right, and why isn't Mangkorn here yet?

00:04:16.355 --> 00:04:17.186
Milin.

00:04:18.081 --> 00:04:18.612
Milin!

00:04:18.612 --> 00:04:19.721
Huh, Pa?

00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:21.333
Have you called Mangkorn yet?

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:23.018
It's almost over. Why isn't he here yet?

00:04:23.018 --> 00:04:26.462
I called once, he didn't answer.

00:04:26.462 --> 00:04:28.262
Mmm, can you try calling him one more time?

00:04:28.544 --> 00:04:30.356
Yes.

00:04:30.356 --> 00:04:33.439
Calm down. The traffic's bad. He'll be here. Just enjoy that.

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:35.888
It's almost over...

00:04:35.888 --> 00:04:39.568
Hello, bro, where are you? Ma and Pa have been waiting for you.

00:04:39.568 --> 00:04:42.733
Tell them, Lin, that I won't be able to make it.

00:04:42.733 --> 00:04:45.694
I gotta study with my friends, alright?

00:04:45.694 --> 00:04:46.931
Okay.

00:04:46.931 --> 00:04:48.931
Tell Pa that, alright. See ya.

00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:59.021
Was that your girlfriend?

00:05:14.316 --> 00:05:16.600
It wasn't.

00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:18.291
It's my sister.

00:05:25.251 --> 00:05:27.940
Have you been waiting long?

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.860
For you, Da...

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.860
no matter how long it takes, I'll wait.

00:05:34.748 --> 00:05:36.792
Are you tired of your own bar?

00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:40.719
Why are you inviting me to this instead?

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.719
Do you want me to do that...the stuff that we did?

00:05:48.638 --> 00:05:52.324
Da, wanna eat anything?

00:05:52.324 --> 00:05:56.324
Eh...I'd like to eat something big...

00:05:57.493 --> 00:06:01.493
Is there anything big around here?

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:58.188
Doing a business in Singhawattanachok's way,

00:06:58.188 --> 00:07:00.591
is like planting seeds into the ground.

00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:03.278
And wait for them to grow.

00:07:03.278 --> 00:07:06.960
Therefore, we need to think about the soil, water, sunlight, and air.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.604
Is it adequate for those seeds?

00:07:09.604 --> 00:07:12.609
It's like finding the right spot to do the business.

00:07:12.609 --> 00:07:14.375
You may get the profit.

00:07:14.375 --> 00:07:15.746
You may lose some.

00:07:15.746 --> 00:07:18.393
But overall, you'll know how to solve the problems.

00:07:18.393 --> 00:07:20.962
Wow, Yai is so awesome.

00:07:20.962 --> 00:07:23.927
Aside from being handsome, rich and great profile,

00:07:23.927 --> 00:07:24.857
he's still good at studying.

00:07:24.857 --> 00:07:26.862
Right, I want half of what that guy has.

00:07:26.862 --> 00:07:28.110
Girls will be all over me.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.158
Mmm.

00:07:29.158 --> 00:07:29.806
Guys, look!

00:07:29.806 --> 00:07:30.454
Huh?

00:07:30.454 --> 00:07:32.979
Ajo, the star of Faculty of Architecture.

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:34.098
So pretty.

00:07:34.098 --> 00:07:35.185
Really pretty.

00:07:36.155 --> 00:07:38.801
She's like an angel.

00:07:38.801 --> 00:07:40.687
Look.

00:07:40.687 --> 00:07:44.687
So, any words for those interested in doing this kind of business?

00:07:45.525 --> 00:07:48.214
Like I said before,...

00:07:48.214 --> 00:07:51.265
starting a business is like trying with trial and error.

00:07:51.265 --> 00:07:54.193
Therefore, we must dare to risk it.

00:07:54.193 --> 00:07:55.642
Dare to invest.

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:58.562
And dare to face failures.

00:07:58.562 --> 00:08:01.930
Lastly, I'd like to tell the juniors that...

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.132
learning by trial and error,

00:08:04.132 --> 00:08:07.703
and believe in your own goal.

00:08:07.703 --> 00:08:09.107
I do believe that

00:08:09.107 --> 00:08:14.031
a new generation like us has the efficiency to definitely improve the country.

00:08:14.031 --> 00:08:19.674
Wow, that's great. So can I ask you a personal question then?

00:08:19.674 --> 00:08:23.674
You are so perfect. Have you got a girlfriend?

00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:28.481
Not yet.

00:08:29.727 --> 00:08:30.727
Cut!

00:08:33.576 --> 00:08:35.823
Okay, all set here.

00:08:35.823 --> 00:08:36.823
Okay.

00:08:39.434 --> 00:08:42.801
Thank you so much for giving me the interview today.

00:08:42.801 --> 00:08:45.442
You're very welcome.

00:08:45.442 --> 00:08:48.641
I didn't think that I would see you here, Ajo.

00:08:48.641 --> 00:08:50.047
Are you here helping out the university's work?

00:08:50.047 --> 00:08:53.701
Right. I'm kinda free now so I'm here to help with the uni's work.

00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:57.341
So that means, I will get to see you more often, right?

00:08:57.341 --> 00:09:01.341
Not really. I'm actually quite busy with the all interviewing.

00:09:01.747 --> 00:09:05.747
I'm a new graduate, so I want to work in the right place, you know.

00:09:05.961 --> 00:09:08.523
Mmm, you have my support.

00:09:08.772 --> 00:09:09.772
Thanks.

00:09:13.304 --> 00:09:14.995
Er...Ajo.

00:09:14.995 --> 00:09:17.722
Are you free this Wednesday?

00:09:18.119 --> 00:09:20.810
This Wednesday?

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:22.218
Mmm...

00:09:22.218 --> 00:09:25.028
There's actually a new movie showing.

00:09:25.028 --> 00:09:28.874
So I thought maybe I could invite you to see it together.

00:09:28.874 --> 00:09:32.874
Wednesday? Hmm, I'm actually not.

00:09:33.243 --> 00:09:34.851
Well, I got something to do.

00:09:34.851 --> 00:09:38.851
But if it's in the evening, I could make it.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:42.579
Then we can meet in the evening.

00:09:42.579 --> 00:09:46.579
We can have dinner and then a movie afterwards.

00:09:47.107 --> 00:09:48.837
I'll keep you posted, okay?

00:09:49.285 --> 00:09:50.285
Certainly.

00:09:52.538 --> 00:09:54.941
Then, excuse me.

00:09:54.941 --> 00:09:56.150
Oh, wait.

00:09:56.150 --> 00:10:00.150
Can you wait for a group photo? I'll do a couple more and then it's done.

00:10:00.272 --> 00:10:02.037
Just hold on, would you?

00:10:02.037 --> 00:10:03.502
Oh, of course.

00:10:03.502 --> 00:10:04.502
You wait, okay?

00:10:09.428 --> 00:10:10.508
So the next one...

00:10:10.508 --> 00:10:14.508
Wow, aren't you charming?

00:10:14.961 --> 00:10:16.964
That's the star of Architecture.

00:10:16.964 --> 00:10:18.173
What?

00:10:18.173 --> 00:10:21.268
We're still friends.

00:10:21.268 --> 00:10:22.995
Oh.

00:10:22.995 --> 00:10:26.995
To her, you are, but is she to you?

00:10:27.161 --> 00:10:28.002
That's right.

00:10:28.002 --> 00:10:30.563
Last semester, you helped her with her work.

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:33.048
And you're from Business Administration.

00:10:33.048 --> 00:10:34.970
Alright, c'mon now.

00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:36.854
Stop getting on his nerves.

00:10:36.854 --> 00:10:40.854
I think we should talk about our school breaks's trip.

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:43.298
Guys, are you done packing?

00:10:43.298 --> 00:10:44.666
Done.

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:50.666
I'm so ready for the prawns, shellfish, crabs and fishes in Maldives?

00:10:51.866 --> 00:10:55.472
Hey, Poon, you got the tickets ready, right?

00:10:55.472 --> 00:10:56.720
Tickets?

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:58.809
Shit, I forgot.

00:10:58.809 --> 00:10:59.743
Shit!!!

00:10:59.743 --> 00:11:00.835
Poon!

00:11:01.125 --> 00:11:03.372
It's okay, I'll handle it.

00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:07.017
But, but, but, don't you invite any more people, alright?

00:11:07.017 --> 00:11:10.990
We're going there as the handsome four of the Business Administration.

00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:12.556
Right, George?

00:11:14.717 --> 00:11:15.883
What the hell is wrong with you?

00:11:15.883 --> 00:11:18.883
Well, the handsome four of the Business Administration.

00:11:20.946 --> 00:11:22.946
What the hell?

00:11:49.274 --> 00:11:52.278
I'd like to hear about your inspiration of this work.

00:11:52.278 --> 00:11:55.723
Could you, Mangkorn, brifely tell us?

00:11:56.996 --> 00:12:01.882
This work is the design of the skywalk over the big intersection.

00:12:01.882 --> 00:12:07.960
It involves geometric, and the green area that is eco-friendly.

00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:12.598
This will make people more convenient

00:12:12.598 --> 00:12:14.728
and safer.

00:12:14.728 --> 00:12:17.936
This area will be crucial to the public transportation.

00:12:17.936 --> 00:12:20.823
Also, this will be the interchange to the sky train in the future.

00:12:20.823 --> 00:12:24.991
Wow, this is such an amazing concept.

00:12:24.991 --> 00:12:28.435
That's why you got an award from France.

00:12:28.435 --> 00:12:34.995
So, what made you realize that you liked working in this field?

00:12:34.995 --> 00:12:37.568
Actually, I think it's because...

00:12:37.568 --> 00:12:40.450
when I think or design something,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:44.450
I'll feel good and happy about it.

00:12:44.538 --> 00:12:46.986
But if you ask me if I ever have my downs,

00:12:46.986 --> 00:12:48.588
I do, sometimes.

00:12:48.588 --> 00:12:52.588
That means you've learnt by trials and errors for multiple times, right?

00:12:53.432 --> 00:13:00.166
Yes, but even young people like us can do that as many times as you want,

00:13:00.166 --> 00:13:02.288
the most important part is...

00:13:02.288 --> 00:13:04.579
is...money.

00:13:05.185 --> 00:13:12.185
You can't deny that money takes you further.

00:13:17.195 --> 00:13:18.195
Three...Two...

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.287
"Great architect student, awarded from France, Akira Chisanupongkul."

00:13:25.771 --> 00:13:27.140
"Mangkorn, you're so handsome.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.502
"Another architect student awarded? That's awesome!"

00:13:28.502 --> 00:13:29.629
"My all-time idol!"

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:30.635
"I'd like to be as good as him. Great vision too."

00:13:34.471 --> 00:13:36.518
"Did a guy named Yai come here to brag about his family's business?"

00:13:38.487 --> 00:13:39.934
"Trial and error requires money, too."

00:13:39.934 --> 00:13:40.934
"Handsome, but he's a player."

00:14:15.664 --> 00:14:17.474
Hello, what is it?

00:14:17.474 --> 00:14:19.475
Mr. Yai, are you coming to the bar tonight?

00:14:19.475 --> 00:14:20.975
Yeah, I'll be there.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:35.600
"So are you free for a movie this afternoon?"

00:14:37.202 --> 00:14:40.202
"I have a meeting to attend. Let's do it some other time."

00:14:41.973 --> 00:14:45.973
"That's alright. Don't forget to have dinner."

00:14:51.781 --> 00:14:55.508
It's not so often that I could have a chance to have dinner with you.

00:14:56.674 --> 00:14:59.686
Because I'm so busy, right?

00:14:59.686 --> 00:15:03.722
After a meal with you, I got a meeting with my clients.

00:15:03.722 --> 00:15:07.722
Last time, I ditched you, I still feel guilty till now.

00:15:08.577 --> 00:15:10.057
That's alright.

00:15:10.057 --> 00:15:12.062
Just having a meal with you,

00:15:12.062 --> 00:15:15.748
with this nice atmosphere, beautiful view...

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.475
and a beautiful girl like you...

00:15:18.475 --> 00:15:20.357
This makes me happy.

00:15:20.357 --> 00:15:22.799
You're being too nice.

00:15:22.799 --> 00:15:26.799
I can't even tell if you're telling the truth or the lie, you know.

00:15:27.211 --> 00:15:30.541
On the other day, and I'm happy for you about the award.

00:15:30.541 --> 00:15:33.819
At the setting, it was so chaotic. I didn't know when to congratulate you.

00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:36.631
Thank you so much, Ajo.

00:15:36.631 --> 00:15:40.631
If I didn't get an advice from you, I might not get the award.

00:15:41.718 --> 00:15:43.967
You've got it in you already.

00:15:43.967 --> 00:15:47.686
I'm jealous that you have this kind of talent.

00:15:47.686 --> 00:15:49.816
Mr. Pun asked me to ask you

00:15:49.816 --> 00:15:55.816
if you're interested in the Masters' scholarship in New York.

00:15:56.259 --> 00:15:57.906
New York?

00:15:57.906 --> 00:16:01.156
Yeah, the same one that I got.

00:16:01.156 --> 00:16:04.281
Oh, I'd rather not.

00:16:04.281 --> 00:16:05.964
I wouldn't get it.

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:09.216
One more thing, there are so many people better than me.

00:16:09.216 --> 00:16:11.782
And I have a trainee thingy to do too.

00:16:11.782 --> 00:16:15.782
And Ajo, have you looked for the place to work?

00:16:18.464 --> 00:16:20.630
Right now, I'm a freelancer.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:22.592
Actually, I've sent my resumes to lots of places.

00:16:22.592 --> 00:16:25.952
But the interior job that I'd really like,

00:16:25.952 --> 00:16:27.918
there aren't many spots available.

00:16:27.918 --> 00:16:29.886
There are only design development spots available.

00:16:29.886 --> 00:16:31.493
That's not my expertise.

00:16:31.493 --> 00:16:34.265
But you, you're good at designing, aren't you?

00:16:34.265 --> 00:16:37.344
Concepts and Sketching?

00:16:37.344 --> 00:16:40.956
I heard that you're the first of your entire class.

00:16:40.956 --> 00:16:43.152
Well, not really.

00:16:43.152 --> 00:16:45.841
But I have to thank you, Ajo.

00:16:46.248 --> 00:16:49.701
For having me help you with your thesis that time.

00:16:50.182 --> 00:16:51.312
Thank me?

00:16:51.312 --> 00:16:52.521
Why is that?

00:16:52.521 --> 00:16:56.444
I, am the one to thank you.

00:16:56.444 --> 00:17:00.444
Well, that work gave me experiences.

00:17:01.296 --> 00:17:04.109
One more thing, I could take a closer care of you.

00:17:04.432 --> 00:17:08.432
So no guys would ever hit on you.

00:17:08.477 --> 00:17:12.477
You. You've always encouraged me, you know.

00:17:13.090 --> 00:17:16.536
If I get a job in the company that I like,

00:17:16.536 --> 00:17:18.460
let's celebrate, alright?

00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:19.987
Sure.

00:17:19.987 --> 00:17:21.066
Let's eat.

00:17:21.066 --> 00:17:22.066
Okay.

00:17:24.191 --> 00:17:25.355
You like tomatoes, right?

00:17:25.355 --> 00:17:26.239
Yes.

00:17:26.239 --> 00:17:28.739
Take it.

00:17:54.572 --> 00:17:57.891
Hmm, how many times have I told you, Park?

00:17:57.891 --> 00:17:59.647
The right end goes over the left end

00:17:59.647 --> 00:18:01.404
when tying a tie.

00:18:01.404 --> 00:18:03.243
Why do I always have to teach you?

00:18:03.243 --> 00:18:05.398
Hey, don't complain.

00:18:05.398 --> 00:18:06.798
Hurry up!

00:18:06.798 --> 00:18:07.973
Hey, chill.

00:18:07.973 --> 00:18:09.973
Almost done.

00:18:14.152 --> 00:18:15.072
Just a sec.

00:18:15.072 --> 00:18:16.072
Huh? What?

00:18:23.989 --> 00:18:24.989
Hello?

00:18:26.705 --> 00:18:27.705
Yes.

00:18:45.395 --> 00:18:47.395
Hello, Mr. Yai.

00:18:50.891 --> 00:18:52.368
Park and Pong aren't here yet?

00:18:52.368 --> 00:18:54.368
They are, sir, but I don't know where they're at.

00:20:08.964 --> 00:20:10.999
Yes, Dad?

00:20:10.999 --> 00:20:12.282
What are you doing?

00:20:12.282 --> 00:20:13.755
I'm at the bar.

00:20:13.755 --> 00:20:15.226
About to work on the accounts.

00:20:15.226 --> 00:20:17.853
Have you seen a G Design name card?

00:20:17.853 --> 00:20:20.612
Yes, what project do you have in mind?

00:20:20.612 --> 00:20:24.292
I'll let them renovate the Sunrise bar.

00:20:24.292 --> 00:20:25.773
Huh?

00:20:25.773 --> 00:20:28.443
Renovate?

00:20:28.443 --> 00:20:30.594
Why are we renovating it?

00:20:30.594 --> 00:20:32.189
The bar is nice itself.

00:20:32.189 --> 00:20:33.702
Yes, it is nice.

00:20:33.702 --> 00:20:36.378
But I want to expand it.

00:20:36.378 --> 00:20:39.456
You know that the customers are coming less and less.

00:20:39.456 --> 00:20:41.137
We got a rebranding to do.

00:20:41.137 --> 00:20:42.418
But...

00:20:42.418 --> 00:20:46.418
This Monday, I'll make an appointment with G Design, alright?

00:20:46.731 --> 00:20:50.731
You already look after Sunrise, so help me out with this.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.731
I still have meetings in China...

00:20:53.731 --> 00:20:55.327
Dad.

00:20:55.327 --> 00:20:57.751
But I've already had a plan to go to Maldives with my friends.

00:20:57.751 --> 00:21:00.876
Business or friends, which is more important?

00:21:00.876 --> 00:21:04.027
You know that our business is slowing down.

00:21:04.027 --> 00:21:05.863
That's because you are the one managing it.

00:21:06.218 --> 00:21:08.894
So I have no choice at all.

00:21:09.323 --> 00:21:12.557
I just asked you to go relax with my friends.

00:21:12.557 --> 00:21:14.112
Please.

00:21:14.112 --> 00:21:15.265
Can't you postpone it?

00:21:15.265 --> 00:21:16.426
C'mon.

00:21:16.426 --> 00:21:19.980
Here's the deal. When I go back, I'll buy you a new car, the latest model.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:23.448
Which series? Don't lure me with a car.

00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:29.086
How about you? Flying back and forth. You think you own the airport now or something?

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.598
Are you ever here in Thailand 5 days a month?

00:21:32.598 --> 00:21:35.875
I just asked you to go hang out with my friends for a week.

00:21:35.875 --> 00:21:37.786
Can I not?

00:21:37.786 --> 00:21:38.185
Please.

00:21:38.185 --> 00:21:42.185
I've got a meeting with my partner in China.

00:21:42.895 --> 00:21:46.774
That's your business. I'll go with my friends no matter what.

00:21:46.774 --> 00:21:49.328
If you want to do it, do it yourself.

00:21:49.328 --> 00:21:50.728
The reason I got you to study in Business Adminis...

00:22:27.745 --> 00:22:30.745
Oh, Mr. Yai, have you seen Park?

00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.692
Oh!

00:22:37.692 --> 00:22:39.414
Get up!

00:22:39.414 --> 00:22:40.852
When are you gonna stop being so dumb?

00:22:40.852 --> 00:22:41.852
Well...

00:22:48.007 --> 00:22:52.007
Er...and would you come back to work at the bar around this time, Mr. Yai?

00:22:53.563 --> 00:22:56.356
I think I'll be working until Friday.

00:22:56.356 --> 00:22:59.908
Next week, I'm going abroad with my friends.

00:22:59.908 --> 00:23:02.170
You guys, don't worry about work.

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:06.090
It will take me just a few days to finish.

00:23:06.090 --> 00:23:07.090
Yes, sir.

00:23:19.507 --> 00:23:20.507
What?

00:23:22.124 --> 00:23:25.124
Oh, someone sent us these pics for you to see.

00:23:47.563 --> 00:23:49.563
Damn you, Mangkorn!

00:24:03.795 --> 00:24:06.194
2 days later

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:21.030
Oh, Ajo.

00:24:27.824 --> 00:24:31.390
How did you get here?

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:34.938
Er...I happened to go see the teacher at the faculty.

00:24:34.938 --> 00:24:37.574
So I invited a junior to have dinner here.

00:24:37.574 --> 00:24:41.533
And you, Yai? What got you here?

00:24:41.533 --> 00:24:43.533
Well, I...

00:24:56.932 --> 00:24:58.365
Did I keep you waiting, Ajo?

00:24:58.714 --> 00:24:59.714
Not at all.

00:25:20.507 --> 00:25:24.097
Excuse me. The client asks for the revised work file.

00:25:24.097 --> 00:25:28.097
- That's alright / - That's alright.

00:25:30.852 --> 00:25:36.205
Er...this is Mangkorn, my junior at the Architecture.

00:25:36.205 --> 00:25:41.182
And this is Yai, my junior at Business Administration. He used to help me with my thesis too.

00:25:41.182 --> 00:25:45.182
So now you two know each other.

00:25:47.010 --> 00:25:51.010
Even we never talked, but I've heard of him.

00:25:53.248 --> 00:25:57.248
Mr. Alangkarn Singhawattanachok.

00:25:57.725 --> 00:26:00.127
The famous heir of an entertainment business.

00:26:00.127 --> 00:26:02.767
Also, the one of the country's richest families.

00:26:02.767 --> 00:26:04.884
It's good that you know.

00:26:04.884 --> 00:26:08.884
So you'll know who you're talking with now.

00:26:19.351 --> 00:26:20.754
Er...

00:26:21.055 --> 00:26:25.055
So how did you get here, Yai? You haven't answered me that.

00:26:26.168 --> 00:26:28.208
Are you here with anyone?

00:26:28.208 --> 00:26:29.802
No.

00:26:29.802 --> 00:26:33.802
Actually, my Dad owns this place.

00:26:34.884 --> 00:26:38.884
I'm about to graduate, so my Dad has me run this place.

00:26:39.241 --> 00:26:40.910
Oh, wow. That's nice.

00:26:40.910 --> 00:26:44.910
I didn't know that this place is one of your family's businesses.

00:26:45.226 --> 00:26:47.903
If you'd like to have anything, feel free to order.

00:26:48.702 --> 00:26:52.702
This meal, it's on me.

00:26:54.257 --> 00:26:56.889
No need to.

00:26:56.889 --> 00:27:04.889
Nowadays, when you know someone, you'd better support rather than asking for free food.

00:27:06.687 --> 00:27:10.687
Well, in that case, Ajo...

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.520
is someone Yai knows.

00:27:17.511 --> 00:27:21.511
Let me treat you, Ajo?

00:27:22.387 --> 00:27:23.636
Is that okay, Ajo?

00:27:24.764 --> 00:27:27.688
Er...I agree.

00:27:27.688 --> 00:27:30.972
Since we're here, why don't we support your business?

00:27:30.972 --> 00:27:34.972
And this is also an apology for not going to the movie with you that day too.

00:27:41.525 --> 00:27:42.363
Er...

00:27:42.363 --> 00:27:43.363
May I have the menu, please?

00:27:47.637 --> 00:27:48.637
Thank you.

00:28:03.546 --> 00:28:05.546
What's wrong with Mr. Yai?

00:28:08.943 --> 00:28:09.943
Yeah, right.

00:28:18.506 --> 00:28:19.539
Hey.

00:28:19.856 --> 00:28:21.685
Why don't you go ask Mr. Yai?

00:28:27.284 --> 00:28:28.284
Mr. Yai.

00:28:30.518 --> 00:28:31.868
What's this?

00:28:31.868 --> 00:28:33.822
Medicine for sore throat.

00:28:33.822 --> 00:28:37.580
Why did you bring it? I didn't want any.

00:28:37.580 --> 00:28:39.499
And what would you like then, Mr. Yai?

00:28:39.499 --> 00:28:42.378
That was a secret code! A secret code!

00:28:42.378 --> 00:28:44.378
Go on! Hurry!

00:28:48.329 --> 00:28:49.886
Yai, are you having anything too?

00:28:49.886 --> 00:28:53.886
It's alright.

00:28:54.645 --> 00:28:57.850
Ajo, you can check out the recommended menu.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:28:58.765
Everything is tasty here...

00:28:58.765 --> 00:29:01.157
So what did Mr. Yai say?

00:29:01.157 --> 00:29:02.996
He said it was a secret code.

00:29:02.996 --> 00:29:04.424
What secret code?

00:29:04.663 --> 00:29:06.340
Huh?

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:09.417
Code...

00:29:09.417 --> 00:29:12.855
Oh! The secret code!

00:29:12.855 --> 00:29:14.002
Keep it down!

00:29:14.002 --> 00:29:16.002
The secret code.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.440
Cheers!

00:29:25.593 --> 00:29:28.628
Wow, this is so good.

00:29:28.628 --> 00:29:32.233
Much better than the five-star restaurant that I used to go to.

00:29:32.233 --> 00:29:34.703
Oh, wow, thank you.

00:29:34.703 --> 00:29:38.703
If you like it, then please come here more often.

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.530
Er...would you excuse me for a sec?

00:30:01.248 --> 00:30:03.277
Today...

00:30:03.277 --> 00:30:05.277
No hitting on any girls?

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:09.422
Hmm...

00:30:09.863 --> 00:30:12.257
Such a pity.

00:30:12.257 --> 00:30:16.257
I thought I was gonna chill here with Ajo.

00:30:17.615 --> 00:30:27.258
Turns out that I gotta meet the owner who's having a fierce face like a...

00:30:27.258 --> 00:30:29.258
tiger.

00:30:40.887 --> 00:30:42.043
Hey, Park.

00:30:42.043 --> 00:30:42.996
Mr. Yai did it again.

00:30:42.996 --> 00:30:43.786
Go! Go on!

00:30:43.786 --> 00:30:47.432
Oh, okay.

00:30:47.432 --> 00:30:50.062
Guys, I have to get going.

00:30:50.062 --> 00:30:51.645
There's been an urgent call.

00:30:51.645 --> 00:30:53.434
Mangkorn, don't leave just yet.

00:30:53.434 --> 00:30:55.551
Keep Yai a company.

00:30:55.551 --> 00:30:57.662
Please.

00:30:57.662 --> 00:30:59.662
May I have my purse?

00:31:00.728 --> 00:31:02.199
See you then, Ajo.

00:31:02.199 --> 00:31:04.468
I'm so sorry. I'll chill with you guys some other time.

00:31:04.468 --> 00:31:05.468
See you.

00:31:30.503 --> 00:31:31.379
Park, hurry up!

00:31:31.379 --> 00:31:32.379
Right, right. I know.

00:31:41.915 --> 00:31:43.189
Are you done?

00:31:43.489 --> 00:31:44.489
Man, hold on.

00:31:45.887 --> 00:31:46.887
Red or blue?

00:31:48.601 --> 00:31:51.153
Hey, faster! Someone might come.

00:31:51.153 --> 00:31:53.579
Well, you hold it.

00:31:53.579 --> 00:31:55.579
Here are two magaritas.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.730
Well, you were awarded, right? Why not just celebrating?

00:32:09.884 --> 00:32:11.884
To tonight.

00:32:14.962 --> 00:32:18.962
Mmm, to tonight.

00:32:28.236 --> 00:32:30.236
Give me another one.

00:32:31.385 --> 00:32:32.385
Of course.

00:33:38.911 --> 00:33:39.911
Watch out.

00:33:41.507 --> 00:33:43.507
My gosh, he's heavy.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:47.175
Over here.

00:33:47.175 --> 00:33:48.652
Okay.

00:33:48.652 --> 00:33:50.652
You take that side.

00:33:51.771 --> 00:33:54.332
What did you give him?

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:55.812
It took so long

00:33:55.812 --> 00:33:57.452
for him to pass out.

00:33:57.452 --> 00:33:59.809
Just like you ordered, sir.

00:33:59.809 --> 00:34:01.001
Oh, or would you like me to give him more?

00:34:01.001 --> 00:34:02.112
No need to.

00:34:02.112 --> 00:34:04.145
I'll take it from here.

00:34:04.145 --> 00:34:05.184
You guys can leave now.

00:34:05.184 --> 00:34:09.334
Would you like us to wait outside or...

00:34:09.334 --> 00:34:12.332
Just leave already, wherever.

00:34:12.332 --> 00:34:13.332
Go on!

00:34:58.726 --> 00:35:00.726
You'll sleep for ages.

00:35:34.984 --> 00:35:36.984
How dare you hit on the girl that I like?

00:35:41.173 --> 00:35:43.173
Mangkorn, Akira.

00:35:45.729 --> 00:35:48.800
A popular one from the Faculty of Architecture.

00:35:48.800 --> 00:35:52.800
Everyone likes you, everyone loves you.

00:35:55.837 --> 00:35:59.837
Well, let's see.

00:36:00.067 --> 00:36:04.067
What if this video leaks, will you still be loved?

00:36:23.159 --> 00:36:24.159
Let go!

00:36:28.565 --> 00:36:32.514
Do you think a guy like me can be fooled easily?

00:36:32.514 --> 00:36:36.514
I'll show you why everyone likes me so much.

00:36:37.833 --> 00:36:38.833
Let go of me!

00:36:42.114 --> 00:36:44.628
You're not so smart as your mouth is.

00:36:44.628 --> 00:36:48.503
A guy like me won't lose to a guy like you.

00:36:48.503 --> 00:36:49.297
Let go!

00:36:49.297 --> 00:36:50.297
Damn you!

00:38:48.799 --> 00:38:49.799
What?

00:38:50.456 --> 00:38:51.456
Shit!

00:39:10.258 --> 00:39:12.258
"Did I screw your brains out last night?"

00:39:54.147 --> 00:39:56.147
"Did I screw your brains out last night?"

00:40:23.536 --> 00:40:25.268
What's up?

00:40:25.268 --> 00:40:27.276
Last night...

00:40:27.276 --> 00:40:28.715
did you have fun?

00:40:28.715 --> 00:40:30.168
Fun, my ass.

00:40:30.168 --> 00:40:30.901
Last night was just...

00:40:30.901 --> 00:40:36.901
You were the one who asked for more, more, more and more, weren't you?

00:40:48.325 --> 00:40:50.932
It's been just a few hours ago.

00:40:50.932 --> 00:40:53.859
How could you not remember?

00:40:53.859 --> 00:40:55.071
What a shame!

00:40:55.071 --> 00:40:56.915
Stop talking.

00:40:56.915 --> 00:40:58.364
And forget about last night.

00:40:58.364 --> 00:41:00.854
How could I?

00:41:00.854 --> 00:41:03.743
It was the hottest night of us two.

00:41:03.743 --> 00:41:07.743
You could make a sexy face?

00:41:07.947 --> 00:41:10.947
I thought you could only make a fierce face.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:17.329
But in the video that you got, there's your face too.

00:41:17.329 --> 00:41:19.489
I could always censor my face.

00:41:19.489 --> 00:41:20.944
Don't be so stupid.

00:41:20.944 --> 00:41:23.264
Can't you come up with that?

00:41:23.264 --> 00:41:27.264
You know, what you did was horrible.

00:41:28.841 --> 00:41:31.525
But I was onto it.

00:41:31.525 --> 00:41:33.692
Listen to me now.

00:41:33.692 --> 00:41:36.459
No matter what you do,

00:41:36.459 --> 00:41:39.587
you're never going to beat me.

00:41:39.587 --> 00:41:41.753
And about last night,

00:41:41.753 --> 00:41:44.753
You won't be able to forget it.

00:41:47.998 --> 00:41:49.498
Hello? Hello?

00:42:32.762 --> 00:42:34.762
Dad! I'm going to renovate the bar!

00:42:39.368 --> 00:42:41.368
G Design is ready, Mr. Yai.

00:43:15.213 --> 00:43:16.199
What are you doing?

00:43:16.199 --> 00:43:17.611
You didn't look at my foot.

00:43:18.112 --> 00:43:20.679
You didn't tell me that you were gonna kick.

00:43:20.679 --> 00:43:22.678
Your clumsiness is one thing.

00:43:22.678 --> 00:43:25.044
We've known each other for almost twenty years.

00:43:25.044 --> 00:43:27.091
When are you gonna stop being like this?

00:43:27.091 --> 00:43:28.616
Why do you always complain?

00:43:28.616 --> 00:43:30.541
Just hold on to the mitts, I'll knee strike.

00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:31.541
Alright, got it.

00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:39.279
Oh, yeah.

00:43:39.279 --> 00:43:42.839
Last night, we left Mr. Yai alone,

00:43:42.839 --> 00:43:44.797
would that be okay?

00:43:44.797 --> 00:43:48.450
How would it not be okay? I gave that guy the whole tube of anesthetic.

00:43:48.450 --> 00:43:52.496
Which color did you give him?

00:43:52.496 --> 00:43:53.496
Red, of course.

00:43:59.745 --> 00:44:00.952
Hey, hurry up! Someone might come.

00:44:00.952 --> 00:44:02.715
Hold on, I'm putting it in.

00:44:04.152 --> 00:44:06.559
C'mon, don't worry.

00:44:06.559 --> 00:44:08.322
I put it in twice.

00:44:08.322 --> 00:44:09.123
Hey, c'mon, did you get it?

00:44:09.123 --> 00:44:11.123
Yeah, you just watch out.

00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:14.960
Which one?

00:44:15.840 --> 00:44:16.840
This one.

00:44:20.059 --> 00:44:22.059
What's wrong?

00:44:24.618 --> 00:44:25.822
Hey!

00:44:25.822 --> 00:44:27.385
Hey! What's wrong?

00:44:27.385 --> 00:44:29.350
Hey!

00:44:29.350 --> 00:44:31.350
Are you alright?

00:44:35.433 --> 00:44:36.716
I was in the shower,

00:44:36.716 --> 00:44:37.721
and I fell on the roll-on deodorant.

00:44:37.721 --> 00:44:38.407
Huh?

00:44:38.407 --> 00:44:40.407
G Design is ready, Mr. Yai.

00:44:44.458 --> 00:44:45.986
No matter how much money you have,

00:44:45.986 --> 00:44:47.834
the warmth in the family

00:44:47.834 --> 00:44:48.834
is also important.

00:44:49.593 --> 00:44:50.593
Please excuse me.

00:44:52.807 --> 00:44:54.734
Delete the video clip,

00:44:54.734 --> 00:44:57.661
or you'll get in trouble.

00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:59.141
Why should I?

00:44:59.141 --> 00:45:01.141
That video clip is so hot.
