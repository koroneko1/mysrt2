172
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,291
Settin' the table.

173
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:43,416
-[in Italian accent] You set-a the table.
-Oh, here he goes.

176
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,500
Hey... Hey, Melanie.

177
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,083
[clears throat] How's it go...

178
00:08:58,166 --> 00:08:59,458
[chiming continues]

179
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:02,250
-[Melanie] <i>Hey.</i>
-Hey back. Hey back to you.

180
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,416
<i>Hey. </i>[laughs]

181
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:06,416
<i>Um, OK, so,</i>
<i>I had a question about the lit paper.</i>

182
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,083
Oh, yeah, cool. Um...

183
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,916
<i>So, it's themes in Faust, right?</i>
<i>So, what do you think?</i>

184
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
-I see Gretchen as kind of an underdog.
<i>-Yeah.</i>

185
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:18,208
A lonely character with a troubled past.
And then... then she's kinda executed.

186
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,708
<i>-I know. It's really--</i>
-[chuckles]

187
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,000
<i>Whoa!</i> [chuckles]

188
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:25,375
<i>That's a big bottle of lotion</i>
<i>you got there.</i>

189
00:09:25,458 --> 00:09:27,166
Huh? Oh, th...

190
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:28,291
No, this is, um...

191
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,750
-It's 'cause I...
-[giggling]

192
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,750
I just have exceptionally dry elbows.

193
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,250
<i>-Sexually dry?</i>
-Exceptionally--

194
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,291
-[knocking at door]
-Knock, knock. Oh, hey! Uh...

195
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:36,416
I didn't mean to interrupt.

196
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,250
-I'm sorry. You guys getting naked?
-No...

197
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,333
-[Melanie] <i>Mr. Johnson, what are you...</i>
-You taking each other's clothes off?

198
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,833
-No, Dad.
<i>-We're not doing that.</i>

199
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,458
I... I didn't wanna ruin the moment.
I thought you guys were

200
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,708
-hooking up online.
<i>-Oh God.</i>

201
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,416
-Dad, it's not like that.
-Online hook-up.

202
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,166
-'Cause you had the lotions out.
-I have exceptionally dry elbows.

203
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,125
-But lotion's also used to masturbate.
-Dad! No! Why? Why?

204
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:55,166
Uh-oh. Well...

205
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,208
-Oh...
-[Dad] Hey! Hey!

206
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,083
You and Melanie? What?

207
00:09:59,166 --> 00:10:02,791
Tell me. Come on. Are you guys a thing?
You're not a thing? What's happening?

208
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:03,708
She...

209
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,916
-doesn't see me like that.
-What?

210
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Her loss.

211
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,625
And your gain.

212
00:10:08,708 --> 00:10:11,500
Or I'm not sure how it's your gain,
but it's her loss.

213
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:13,916
OK.

214
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,166
[inhales deeply] So, look, I know
you don't wanna take those pills,

215
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,958
but you gotta show your mom and I
that you're at least trying.

216
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,541
OK? Could you do that for me?

217
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:26,250
I am trying, but you want me to tell you
that it was all in my head?

218
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,500
Well, you know...

219
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,083
I mean,

220
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,958
I just want you to get better, you know?

221
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:36,625
Get you back to feeling normal.

222
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,166
-What if I'll never be normal?
-Don't say that.

223
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,958
It's hard, but...

224
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,291
-it's through adversity that--
-That we find our strength.

225
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:48,916
We find our strength. Yes.

226
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
I know.

227
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,500
You've told me a thousand times, but...

228
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:56,750
But you've also told me
to stay true to myself.

229
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:57,666
Yes.

230
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,166
And...

231
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
-And now you're asking me to lie.
-I'm not asking you to lie.

232
00:11:03,791 --> 00:11:04,833
It happened, Dad.

233
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:06,500
I...

234
00:11:07,666 --> 00:11:08,500
OK.

235
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:09,875
OK.

236
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,666
I'm telling you the truth.

237
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,833
Good night.

238
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:16,791
I love you.

239
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,333
If you don't like that lotion,
I have another that--

240
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,666
Dad, just... God!

241
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,625
-He still believes it happened.
-OK.

242
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,291
-So, we're gonna do this.
-Mm-hmm.

243
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:33,375
-Tomorrow.
-Yes.

244
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,791
We're going to pick him up
at lunch tomorrow...

245
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,958
together. OK?

246
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,500
Cole, come on. You're gonna be late.

247
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,208
I can't find my lit paper anywhere!

248
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,833
-[Dad] Did you check up your butt?
-Where?

249
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,958
[Dad laughs] I'm kidding.
I have no idea, man.

250
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,791
I barely know how old I am anymore.

251
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:00,291

252
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:02,958

253
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:05,083
[Dad] Cole, come on, man.

254
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,458
Yeah. Yeah, I'm coming.

255
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,541
-[Dad] Do you wanna drive?
-[Cole] No.

256
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:12,750
[Dad] All right. I don't want to either,
but I'll do it.

257
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,208
-[Cole] Melanie.
-What's up?

258
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,708
-They're sending me away. Today.
-What? Let me see.

259
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:18,625
What?

260
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:19,916
No.

261
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,791
It's not you.
It's this place that's making you crazy.

262
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,125
You need to get out of here.

263
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,458
I mean, you need to get out of town,
clear your head.

264
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,583
We're all going to the lake this weekend.
Just come with me. I'm leaving at lunch.

265
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:36,875
-My parents would never let me do that.
-You're not gonna ask your parents,

266
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,833
just like I'm not gonna ask my dad.

267
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:41,458
And I already took his car, so...

268
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,041
You took your dad's car?

269
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,833
I don't know. I don't think
that's a good idea, because--

270
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:51,416
[Cole] Uh...

271
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,500
They're to make me less anxious,

272
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,958
but they just kinda make me feel
like somebody else.

273
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:57,083
And I pass out.

274
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:02,666
It's no big deal.
I mean, everyone is on some shit.

275
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,000
-Really?
-Yeah.

What's she on?

Hey, girl.
You going to the lake this weekend?

291
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,541
Oh yeah. I can't wait to finger you.

292
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,375
[Melanie] Unclear, but...

293
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,791
I heard she killed her parents.

294
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,791
-Seriously? Where'd you hear that?
-Like, everywhere.

295

It means that...

322
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,583
taking shortcuts is a cop-out.

323
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:19,166

working for it is ultimately unrewarding.

00:30:49,666 --> 00:30:50,625
Why?

673
00:30:50,708 --> 00:30:52,916
-You know I wanna be an influencer.
-[scoffs]

674
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,708
OK, enough chitchat.
You bring anything to tie him up with?

675
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:56,791
Sure did, bro.

676
00:30:58,666 --> 00:31:00,833
Great. What the fuck is this?

677
00:31:00,916 --> 00:31:03,750
Jimmy, you were supposed to go to
the hardware store, you fucking idiot.

678
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:06,833
Yeah, but there's a crafting store
so much closer to my house.

679
00:31:06,916 --> 00:31:09,416
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Why are we tying him up?

680
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,583
-Why can't we just kill him?
-[panting]

681
00:31:11,666 --> 00:31:13,208
-[Max] Let's go!
-[Allison] Oh yeah!

682
00:31:13,291 --> 00:31:16,833
Come, come, come on.
Wait. Whoa. Hold on. Hey! Ha!

683
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:20,083
-Stop. Hammer time!
-I cannot watch him crawl anymore.

684
00:31:20,166 --> 00:31:22,333
Come right for the nuts.
Huh! Drop down low.

685
00:31:22,416 --> 00:31:25,208
[grunting]

686
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,666
We need to keep him alive for the ritual,
then we kill him.

687
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:31,500
-Where's Sonya?
-[Allison] Where is that sexy psychopath?

688
00:31:31,583 --> 00:31:33,833
I'm here. Getting cookies.

689
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:38,166
-Get back! Get back!
-Whoa! Yes, Cole!

690
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:40,541
Standing up for yourself,
just like I showed you!

691
00:31:40,625 --> 00:31:43,458
-Get back, all of you! Stand back!
-Let's draw some blood.

692
00:31:43,541 --> 00:31:45,541
[ethereal music playing]

693
00:31:46,166 --> 00:31:47,166
Ooh.

694
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:51,791
We're back!

695
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,750
You!

696
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:03,208
Oh, I knew you were a part of this!
You black cat, hitchhiking Picard killer.

697
00:32:03,291 --> 00:32:05,458
You're the new bad! [panting]

698
00:32:07,041 --> 00:32:10,000
I'm just looking for gas.
My jet ski's running low.

699
00:32:10,083 --> 00:32:11,750
[Boom Boom gasping]

700
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:14,083
Clearly,
you guys are into some heavy cosplay.

701
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:15,791
Just leave you be.

702
00:32:16,916 --> 00:32:18,000
Oh no!

703
00:32:18,083 --> 00:32:20,083
It's all gonna get fucked up again.

704
00:32:20,166 --> 00:32:21,666
Nothing is going to get fucked up.

705
00:32:22,416 --> 00:32:23,458
Ow!

706
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,083
Oh shit!

707
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:28,041
In the face! Right in the face!

708
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:29,458
Max, go grab them.

709
00:32:29,541 --> 00:32:31,500
Damn, it feels good to be back!

710
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:35,375
Whoo! I'm coming, Cole!
I'm coming for you!

711
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:38,083
[suspenseful music playing]

712
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,708
-Go! Let's go! Go, go, go!
-Holy shit!

713
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:43,208
-Just go!
-[Phoebe] Get away from me!

714
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,250
-What are you doing? OK!
-[Cole] Go on, go!

715
00:32:46,458 --> 00:32:47,375
[Cole] Go, go, go!

716
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:53,208
[reverential music playing]

717
00:32:54,666 --> 00:32:55,875
That motherfucker!

718
00:32:55,958 --> 00:32:58,416
First Travis Scott and Kylie Jenner
break up, now this?

719
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,500
[dramatic music playing]

720
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,791
[both panting]

721
00:33:14,375 --> 00:33:15,208
What was that?

722
00:33:15,291 --> 00:33:16,708
[Cole panting]

723
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,708
Wait. You saw that?

724
00:33:18,791 --> 00:33:21,166
You saw the dead girl,
the bloodthirsty maniacs?

725
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:24,666
Did I see that? Of course I saw that shit!
Why'd they kill that girl?

726
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,583
OK, look,
I... I know this is gonna sound crazy,

727
00:33:28,666 --> 00:33:32,541
but, basically, they're a blood cult,
and they made a deal with the Devil,

728
00:33:32,625 --> 00:33:35,625
and in exchange for their souls,
they get any life they want.

729
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:40,833
Thank God. I thought they were zombies.
I hate zombies.

730
00:33:40,916 --> 00:33:42,208
You... you believe me?

731
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:46,291
Yes. What else do you expect from
attention-seeking social media millennials

732
00:33:46,375 --> 00:33:47,333
with esteem issues?

733
00:33:47,416 --> 00:33:48,750
-Shit.
-[Max] Nice job, newbies.

734
00:33:48,833 --> 00:33:50,000
Grade A bed-shitting.

735
00:33:50,083 --> 00:33:52,458
-[Melanie] You losers let him go.
-It was a simple task.

736
00:33:52,541 --> 00:33:55,541
How hard is it to contain and drain
a 60-pound freshman?

737
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,125
Just remember,
you guys screwed it up the first time.

738
00:33:58,208 --> 00:34:00,375
That's the only reason
I was called in from the bullpen.

739
00:34:00,458 --> 00:34:03,375
OK, ticktock, teeny-weenies. Let's go!

740
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,083
Ah, you want us to film this?

741
00:34:05,166 --> 00:34:07,708
[Allison] Not the app!
Like a clock. A clock clock.

742
00:34:07,791 --> 00:34:09,541
[Diego] Oh! Like an old clock.

743
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,250
-Update me on the psycho Breakfast Club.
-OK.

744
00:34:12,333 --> 00:34:14,291
Basically,
I saw the older ones die two years ago,

745
00:34:14,375 --> 00:34:17,833
but clearly, they're back to life,
like they're mimetic metal or something.

746
00:34:17,916 --> 00:34:18,958
Liquid alloy?

747
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:21,708
-Wait, you watched <i>Terminator 2?</i>
-Yes.

748
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:24,916
It's one of the four sequels in history
that supersedes the original.

749
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:28,750
Where... We have to stick together.
Where are you going?

750
00:34:28,833 --> 00:34:29,666
"We"?

751
00:34:30,083 --> 00:34:31,291
We are not a thing.

752
00:34:31,791 --> 00:34:34,791
Bear Grylls clearly stipulates
to never split up when in the wild.

753
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:37,708
Bear Grylls stays at the Ritz-Carlton
with the guys from <i>Queer Eye.</i>

754
00:34:37,791 --> 00:34:40,625
Listen, they're not gonna stop
until they kill us.

755
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:42,666
Both of us.

756
00:34:43,291 --> 00:34:45,958
Let's just go get them!
I'm already losing hair.

757
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:50,416
-I think... I think Sonya cursed me.
-Do what, Allison? Look. Hello! Hello!

758
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:54,083
We're in the middle of Camp Crystal Lake,
and we don't where the fuck they went.

759
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:55,333
Yes, we do.

760
00:34:56,250 --> 00:35:00,375
-[lighter cap clicks]
-They have no idea what we're capable of.

761
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,458
We need something to fight with.
What do you have in your murder pack?

762
00:35:04,541 --> 00:35:06,833
None of your business, and nothing useful.

763
00:35:07,375 --> 00:35:11,375
OK, let me see what I got.
OK, silly string, lighter...

764
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:16,041
[Phoebe] "Magnum XLs."

765
00:35:16,416 --> 00:35:19,666
Who were you and your massive schlong
planning to have sex with tonight, Cole?

766
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:22,666
I thought tonight
was gonna go really differently.

767
00:35:28,083 --> 00:35:31,291
Listen, they only have till sunrise
to complete the ritual, OK?

768
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,583
-So we just have to make it till morning.
-[whooshing]

769
00:35:40,208 --> 00:35:43,375
[grunting, groaning]

770
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,375
[Melanie] They're right there.

771
00:35:48,875 --> 00:35:49,958
I got this.

772
00:35:50,625 --> 00:35:51,458
[sniffs]

773
00:35:51,541 --> 00:35:54,416
This is gonna be so good.

774
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,416
[Sonya] Mmm.

775
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,291
[coughing]

776
00:35:59,375 --> 00:36:02,333
Now do you agree with me?
We have to stick together, Phoebe.

777
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:04,708
Phoebe?

778
00:36:05,125 --> 00:36:07,125
I wouldn't go out there alone
if I were you.

779
00:36:07,458 --> 00:36:08,458
You're not me!

780
00:36:09,958 --> 00:36:11,208
I came here for a reason.

781
00:36:13,833 --> 00:36:15,833
[breathing heavily]

782
00:36:22,416 --> 00:36:25,375
[tense music playing]

783
00:36:25,458 --> 00:36:27,666
[Phoebe panting]

784
00:36:39,333 --> 00:36:41,291
[breathing shakily]

785
00:36:53,125 --> 00:36:54,458
[birds squawk]

786
00:36:54,541 --> 00:36:56,375
Oh God! [Phoebe pants]

787
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,333
[distant guitar melody playing]

788
00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:15,625
Excuse me? Excuse me?

789
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:17,458
Sir, hello? Hi.

790
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:19,875
-[man] Hi.
-Listen--

791
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:20,791
[man] How you doing?

792
00:37:20,875 --> 00:37:24,791
I'm really sorry. I don't mean to intrude,
but I could really use your help.

793
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:27,458
Is there any chance you could
give me a ride back into town?

794
00:37:27,541 --> 00:37:28,375
Yeah.

795
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,458
Yeah, I can do that.

796
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:35,041
Gonna take a minute, 'cause my wife
is out getting some, uh, firewood.

797
00:37:37,333 --> 00:37:39,500
Don't... don't be a stranger.

798
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:41,708
Of course. Yeah.

799
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:43,000
Well, come on.

800
00:37:48,583 --> 00:37:49,458
[man sighs]

801
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:52,666
[man exhales]

802
00:37:55,083 --> 00:37:56,166
[Phoebe] Thank you.

803
00:37:57,916 --> 00:38:00,500
Shaking like a little deer, huh?
Let's get you warm.

804
00:38:04,375 --> 00:38:05,375
Come on, hey.

805
00:38:05,458 --> 00:38:06,875
Come on. Get warm. Get warm.

806
00:38:07,333 --> 00:38:08,333
Get a seat.

807
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:09,333
-OK.
-Huh?

808
00:38:09,416 --> 00:38:10,583
Get you taken care of.

809
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,375
[blows]

810
00:38:14,791 --> 00:38:16,791
-It's a nice fire, huh?
-Yeah.

811
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:18,500
-Yeah.
-Really nice.

812
00:38:20,458 --> 00:38:21,458
Do you like fish?

813
00:38:23,625 --> 00:38:24,625
Sure, yeah.

814
00:38:25,583 --> 00:38:26,583
I like snapper.

815
00:38:27,625 --> 00:38:28,500
That's cool.

816
00:38:29,875 --> 00:38:31,583
What're you doing out here alone?

817
00:38:31,666 --> 00:38:32,750
Oh, I'm not alone.

818
00:38:33,291 --> 00:38:34,958
I... I... I wasn't.

819
00:38:35,083 --> 00:38:37,166
He... It's a long story.
He's still out there.

820
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:38,458
I hope he's OK.

821
00:38:38,875 --> 00:38:39,708
Yeah.

822
00:38:40,375 --> 00:38:42,791
Listen, I... I'm really sorry,
I don't mean to bother,

823
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:45,208
but do you know
when your wife will be back?

824
00:38:46,708 --> 00:38:47,708
I don't.

825
00:38:49,916 --> 00:38:51,375
She left ten years ago.

826
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,000
[tense music playing]

827
00:38:54,875 --> 00:38:57,875
-No, hey, now you just calm down.
-Listen, I... No, I have to go.

828
00:38:57,958 --> 00:38:59,708
-Shh.
-No, I really should be going.

829
00:38:59,791 --> 00:39:02,625
No! Get your hands off of me!
Don't touch me. Let go!

830
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,291
-I can't be here.
-Be quiet, little fish.

831
00:39:04,375 --> 00:39:05,666
-Get your hands off me!
-Shut up.

832
00:39:06,166 --> 00:39:08,791
Wow, you guys making s'mores?
I absolutely love s'mores!

833
00:39:09,208 --> 00:39:12,541
I think the trick to a perfect s'more
is to get the right heat balance

834
00:39:12,625 --> 00:39:15,833
between the marshmallow, the chocolate,
and the graham cracker. I love s'mores.

835
00:39:15,916 --> 00:39:18,166
[singsong] I eat them just for pleasure!

836
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:19,500
[echoes]

837
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,166
Hey, this a private party.

838
00:39:23,583 --> 00:39:26,041
We'll just take our private parts
and be on our way.

839
00:39:27,375 --> 00:39:28,708
Get back here! [grunts]

840
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,875
[man] Goddamn it!

841

[Sonya] Gotta look gorgeous for the One.
Your gorgeous dark One.

847
00:39:49,958 --> 00:39:50,958
Sonya.

848
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,291
[Sonya] You came for me.

[both screaming]

850
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:58,125
I'll gut you like a fish!

851
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,041
Silence, rapist.

852

[gasps] What the hell?

859
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,791
Your blood belongs to us, Cole!

860
00:40:21,875 --> 00:40:22,958
Yeah! Cole!

00:40:34,458 --> 00:40:37,083
-Seriously?
-Turn off your brights, asshole!

867
00:40:37,166 --> 00:40:38,166
[Cole] Oh shit!

868
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,416
[screams]

869
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:42,458
[Sonya] I'm gonna cut off your face
like Hannibal Lecter, Cole!

00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,416
[screaming]

871
00:40:45,125 --> 00:40:46,958
Get her off! Get her off!

-I'm gonna get--
-[engine revs]

873
00:40:51,125 --> 00:40:52,083
Fuck!

877
00:41:04,666 --> 00:41:05,625
Shall we?

878
00:41:07,583 --> 00:41:08,625
[thud]

879
00:41:10,041 --> 00:41:11,041
[Cole clears throat]

880
00:41:17,833 --> 00:41:18,666
[chuckles]

881

[distant chatter]

882
00:41:20,458 --> 00:41:22,416
Did you hear that? Come on.

883
00:41:25,458 --> 00:41:27,458
[upbeat music playing]

884
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:42,666
[Phoebe] Shh.

885
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,583
[breathing heavily]

886
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:55,875
-Looks like old-ass Sonya failed us.
-"Old"?

887
00:41:55,958 --> 00:41:58,291
-I'm gonna bring it on with this bitch!
-[Max] OK. Easy.

888
00:41:58,375 --> 00:42:01,625
Why don't you little-ass kids
go change your diapers, grab a juice box?

889
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:04,125
-Leave this to the pros.
-We need to shake these clowns.

890
00:42:04,208 --> 00:42:06,083
-[Melanie] We don't need them.
-[snake rattling]

[gasps]

892
00:42:08,416 --> 00:42:09,791
[John] What'd you say, Teletubby?

893
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,125
Noods, I think you need to speak louder.
Hearing's the first thing to go.

894
00:42:14,583 --> 00:42:15,750
[John] What, Zoolander?

895
00:42:16,708 --> 00:42:21,375
He said that hearing
is the first thing to go, Morgan Freeman.

896
00:42:21,458 --> 00:42:25,208
I heard. Morgan Freeman would beat
your ass into a keto diet, motherfucker.

897
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,583
[Diego] Ah!
Suck on these titties, motherfucker.

898
00:42:27,666 --> 00:42:30,583
-[Phoebe] Be very still.
-[Allison] Why is he even awake...

899
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,916
All right. Enough grab-ass.

900
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,208
You wanna play? Let's split up.

901
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,375
[snake hissing]

902
00:42:38,458 --> 00:42:41,208
-See which group can find 'em first.
-A little competition.

903
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:43,083
Yes. Now that I understand.

904
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:44,666
-[John] Yeah.
-[Max] Worst of luck.

905
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:47,625
-[Phoebe] They're leaving.
-[snake rattling]

906
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,833
-[John] Parkour...
-Wait for your hot red-headed friend!

907
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:56,333
-[Melanie] Let's go.
-[rattling]

908
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:57,875

[shuddering breaths]

912
00:43:14,375 --> 00:43:15,875
[tense music continues]

913
00:43:32,958 --> 00:43:34,625
[Diego whimpering]

914
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,916
[Jimmy] I'm here. I'm here.

915
00:43:44,833 --> 00:43:46,541
[Melanie] Are you done sixty-nineing?

916
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,166
-Um... It--
-[Melanie] Now!

917
00:43:49,958 --> 00:43:51,416
It's called ophidiophobia!

918
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:54,375
-Even Indiana Jones was afraid of snakes!
-[mouths] OK.

919
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:57,333
[Phoebe] Come on.

920
00:43:57,958 --> 00:43:59,041
Come on.

921
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:06,458
[Max] Coley! Come out and play!

922
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:08,375
-[Cole] Where are we going?
-[Phoebe] This way.

923
00:44:08,458 --> 00:44:11,791
[Cole] "This way" where? These shoes
are made for reading, not running.

924
00:44:13,041 --> 00:44:15,166
There's a cabin
at the far end of the lake.

925
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:18,541
I was heading there before I ran out
of gas. We could hide out till sunrise.

926
00:44:18,875 --> 00:44:20,125
A cabin in the woods.

927
00:44:20,208 --> 00:44:22,208
Nobody's ever been murdered
in a cabin in the woods.

928
00:44:22,291 --> 00:44:24,166
[Max grunting eerily]

929
00:44:25,166 --> 00:44:27,625
[John] Max! Stop that shit. It's creepy.

930
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:30,791
It's supposed to be.
We're hunting children. [grunts eerily]

931
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:35,333
You know what? I am done, OK?
Done with this chase bullshit.

932
00:44:35,416 --> 00:44:38,000
How about you two go be frivolous
and fetch me that boy?

933
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:39,791
I think she meant "chivalrous."

934
00:44:39,875 --> 00:44:41,958
This rock looks like a spa day!

935
00:44:42,041 --> 00:44:44,166
-I am dead tired.
-And I'm tired of being dead.

936
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:47,416
Can we hurry up and do this shit?
And why you trying to look sexy?

937
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,083
The only thing that's sexy in the desert:
a glass of water.

938
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:52,250
Who goes hiking wearing fuck-me pumps?

939
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:54,833
They're not "fuck-me pumps,"
they're fuck <i>you </i>pumps.

940
00:44:55,208 --> 00:44:56,791
We're gonna go. You hold up the rear.

941
00:44:56,875 --> 00:44:59,958
Now that is a job I can do.
You both have really cute butts.

942
00:45:00,041 --> 00:45:03,375
-You been looking at my ass?
-Wow. You are so lucky you're hot.

943
00:45:03,875 --> 00:45:08,291
Duh! What I've been telling everybody!
Y'all are really lucky I'm hot.

944
00:45:08,791 --> 00:45:10,666
[Cole] Hold on a second.
I gotta tie my shoes.

945
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,416
Hey, um...

946
00:45:14,250 --> 00:45:15,875
[panting]

947
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:19,375
I'm really sorry
for bailing on you out there.

948
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:20,958
Huh?

949
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:23,458
But I really appreciate you coming back.

950
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,833
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

951
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:31,000
What? No, you don't need to say sorry.
I'm sorry. I...

952
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,750
I'm the one who dragged you
into the worst night of your life.

953
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:36,041
Believe it or not,
this is not the worst night of my life.

954
00:45:36,125 --> 00:45:39,125
What, you can beat rattlesnakes,
flamethrowers, and dead bodies?

955
00:45:39,208 --> 00:45:40,875
I mean, did you see Sonya's head?

956
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,791
It's not my first time seeing someone die.

957
00:45:57,458 --> 00:45:59,458
Do you think everything happens
for a reason?

958
00:46:00,750 --> 00:46:01,750
No, Cole.

959
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,916
There's no chakras, no Santa,

960
00:46:07,583 --> 00:46:09,291
no soulmates, no afterlife.

961
00:46:11,708 --> 00:46:13,083
Them's the breaks, Ponyboy.

962
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,375
"Stay gold," my ass.

963
00:46:16,958 --> 00:46:18,583
Wow. That's...

964
00:46:19,875 --> 00:46:22,375
That's a really bleak outlook on the world

965
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:24,833
for somebody
who's about to bring new life into it.

966
00:46:26,708 --> 00:46:27,666
Huh?

967
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:29,708
I mean, you're pregnant.

968
00:46:31,583 --> 00:46:33,916
-Oh! That was all bullshit.
-What?

969
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,083
Yeah, I just said all that so everybody
would leave me alone. Yeah.

970
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:38,791
-Come on.
-You just...

971
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:40,375
[Phoebe] We gotta keep moving.

972
00:46:43,083 --> 00:46:44,625
[tense music playing]

973
00:46:44,708 --> 00:46:45,833
[rocks crumbling]

974
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,708
-Look right.
-Yeah.

975
00:46:52,791 --> 00:46:53,625
Now look up.

976
00:46:53,708 --> 00:46:56,958
And now the three moons,
and then there's that chicken right here.

977
00:46:57,041 --> 00:46:59,291
-So real.
-I wanna just grab it. Boom, boom.

978
00:47:00,041 --> 00:47:02,833
I think it's great
that he's taking a joyride with Melanie.

979
00:47:02,916 --> 00:47:04,791
-Teens being teens.
-Teens being teens!

980
00:47:04,875 --> 00:47:07,958
-That's great parenting. Take the win.
-No, I said no, so I'm not going to.

981
00:47:08,041 --> 00:47:11,041
Why don't I just do everything?
I'll light it, pull the carb out.

982
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:13,208
-If I don't touch, I'm not smoking it.
-It's not real.

983
00:47:13,291 --> 00:47:14,458
It's second-hand smoke.

984
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,000
[gurgling]

985
00:47:17,083 --> 00:47:18,416
[inhales deeply]

986
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,250
[Juan] Jeez!

987
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:26,041
-Take it easy, Snoop.
-[blows]

988
00:47:26,541 --> 00:47:28,833
-My God. Going on tour?
-[coughs]

989
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:31,416
[Cole] How do we know
this cabin's gonna be empty?

990
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,166
I just know, all right?

991
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,208
It was my family's cabin,
but no one's been for a long time.

992
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:39,000
I don't wanna talk about it.
Just whatever. It's empty.

993
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:42,791
Wait, you... you came to a big,
crowded, popular people event

994
00:47:42,875 --> 00:47:45,000
to stay in a remote cabin all by yourself?

995
00:47:45,333 --> 00:47:47,625
I needed to be alone.
You wouldn't understand.

996
00:47:47,708 --> 00:47:51,333
What... Yeah.
Trust me, I... I understand being alone.

997
00:47:52,416 --> 00:47:55,666
I don't know if you noticed,
but everybody at school thinks I'm weird.

998
00:47:55,750 --> 00:47:59,041
I didn't notice. The three-piece suit
seemed perfectly reasonable to me.

999
00:47:59,125 --> 00:48:00,583
Yeah. Ha-ha, OK, but...

1000
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,125
What I'm saying is,
I don't think anyone chooses to--

1001
00:48:03,208 --> 00:48:04,208
-[click]
-[both gasps]

1002
00:48:05,333 --> 00:48:06,750

-[gunshot]
-[both gasp]

1004
00:48:09,916 --> 00:48:15,041
Ooh, I've been thinking about this moment
a long time, Cole-biscuits.

1005
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:16,583
[whimsical music plays]

1006
00:48:17,375 --> 00:48:19,833
I wanna be the world's best journalist.

1007
00:48:20,458 --> 00:48:23,833
Renowned, respected, like Geraldo.

1008
00:48:24,375 --> 00:48:26,166
Only... fuckable.

1009
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,500

Please put it down.
OK? It's me, it's Melanie.

1510
01:15:31,083 --> 01:15:32,208
Get back, now!

1511
01:15:32,291 --> 01:15:33,833
I love you, Cole.

1512
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:39,041
-He's not himself. We need to help him.
-OK, Cole, listen to me...

1513
01:15:39,125 --> 01:15:40,916
-[Cole] She's part of it!
-Part of what?

1514
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,750
-The blood cult.
-He's telling the truth.

1515
01:15:42,833 --> 01:15:44,125
There is no cult! OK?

1516
01:15:44,208 --> 01:15:46,500
-Just put down the weapons, please!
-Put it down.

1517
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:49,833
Nice catch, baby girl!

1518
01:15:49,916 --> 01:15:50,916
Let's go!

1519
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,083
-[Archie] Cole, stop!
-[Cole] Come on! Go!

1520
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:54,375
Cole!

1521
01:15:54,458 --> 01:15:57,166
-Where are you going, sweetie?
-Let go of me!

1522
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:00,250
No! I'm calling it! We out this piece!

1523
01:16:00,333 --> 01:16:02,166
I'm not going anywhere with you.

1524
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:05,000
Oh, my God, you're grounded.
No Coachella--

1525
01:16:05,750 --> 01:16:07,833
[screaming]

1526
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:10,166
That's it! I'm taking your IUD!

1527
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,708
[screaming]

1528
01:16:12,458 --> 01:16:13,791
[Juan, gasping choking]

1529
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:17,666
[both panting]

1530
01:16:17,750 --> 01:16:19,708
I have to face my dad. Run, OK?

1531
01:16:19,791 --> 01:16:21,750
Run until the sun comes up. Don't stop.

1532
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:25,666
I'll find you. I promise I'll find you.

1533
01:16:26,125 --> 01:16:26,958
Go.

1534
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:29,541
-[Archie] Cole!
-Dad...

1535
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:34,125
-Cole.
-Dad, I'm not crazy, OK? I swear!

1536
01:16:34,208 --> 01:16:36,750
-Stop.
-I'm sorry I yelled at you, OK?

1537
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:38,833
But you have to understand, he's a demon.

1538
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:41,166
OK. OK. It's OK, I'm here.

1539
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:42,708
OK.

1540
01:16:43,041 --> 01:16:44,250
-Come on.
-OK.

1541
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:45,875
It's OK.

1542
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:48,708
-I love you, Dad.
-I love you too.

1543
01:16:49,541 --> 01:16:50,583
I love you too.

1544
01:16:51,416 --> 01:16:52,250
[Cole sighs]

1545
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,833
-I'm not going anywhere, OK?
-I'm sorry.

1546
01:16:54,916 --> 01:16:56,541
-[Archie] It's gonna be OK.
-[stabbing]

1547
01:17:02,083 --> 01:17:05,333
-Dad?
-It's OK, it's gonna be OK. I'm here.

1548
01:17:06,083 --> 01:17:08,750
You don't understand, I have to save her.

1549
01:17:09,208 --> 01:17:13,083
-You don't understand...
-I got you. We're gonna get you home.

1550
01:17:17,125 --> 01:17:18,208
So close.

1551
01:17:18,291 --> 01:17:20,500
The knife toss isn't your specialty,
Melanie.

1552
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:25,541
Maybe you should stick with trust
as your weapon of mass destruction.

1553
01:17:25,625 --> 01:17:28,875
Trust is for people that are too scared
to believe in themselves.

1554
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:30,916
-I used to feel the same way.
-I know.

1555
01:17:31,375 --> 01:17:33,500
You're a self-loathing, whiny bitch.

1556
01:17:34,416 --> 01:17:37,000
Which makes you a perfect candidate
for my team.

1557
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:39,291
Join us,
and be the best version of yourself.

1558
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:43,708
So, what's it gonna be?

1559
01:17:47,958 --> 01:17:49,041
[male voice] <i>Fight!</i>

1560

[male voice] <i>Game over!</i>

1564
01:18:41,666 --> 01:18:44,166
Should've taken my offer to be a big fish.

1565
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,541
Now you're just bait.

1566
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:50,208
[Archie sniffles]

1567
01:18:50,958 --> 01:18:53,291
Electric cars... [sniffles]

My God, they're stupid...

01:19:02,791 --> 01:19:05,375
Oh God, my neck. What a night.

[reverential music playing]

1573
01:19:10,875 --> 01:19:12,875
[Melanie sighs] You know,

1574
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:15,458
you and I have a lot in common.

1575
01:19:17,750 --> 01:19:18,583
[chuckles]

1576
01:19:19,791 --> 01:19:22,875
Back there, the way he looked at you...

1577
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:26,666
That's the same way he used to look at me.

1578
01:19:26,750 --> 01:19:28,791
Are you gonna monologue me to death?

1579
01:19:28,875 --> 01:19:32,375
-I mean, I was, but I guess I won't now.
-Your plan's not gonna work.

1580
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:35,291
He's not gonna come back.
His dad probably has him on lockdown.

1581
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:37,250
Cole's a big <i>Terminator </i>fan.

1582
01:19:37,833 --> 01:19:38,833
He'll be back.

1583
01:19:41,166 --> 01:19:42,250

-[car alarm blaring]
-[Archie] Oh shit! Where is it?

1585
01:19:49,708 --> 01:19:53,625
Cole, unlock the door.
Cole, unlock the door.

1586
01:19:55,708 --> 01:19:59,458
Cole! Come on!
Cole, give me the keys. Cole!

1587
01:19:59,541 --> 01:20:01,666
Open up! Uh-oh! Don't go over there.

1588
01:20:02,750 --> 01:20:05,375
Cole! Cole! Cole! Unlock the door.

1589
01:20:06,375 --> 01:20:08,083
-Turn off the car!
-Dad, listen to me.

1590
01:20:08,458 --> 01:20:09,875
Listen to me, OK?

1591
01:20:09,958 --> 01:20:12,833
Look, you're always saying that
we find our strength through adversity.

1592
01:20:12,916 --> 01:20:13,791
Yeah, I...

1593
01:20:14,416 --> 01:20:18,291
Tonight, I realize that strength
is measured by the lengths you'll go to

1594
01:20:18,375 --> 01:20:20,125
-for the people you love.
-Oh, Cole...

1595
01:20:21,125 --> 01:20:23,500
I'm in love with her,
and I made a promise.

1596

Why am I here?

01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,708
You said you needed Cole.
Cole's with his dad.

1600
01:20:39,791 --> 01:20:43,666
Parents don't stand a chance
against a lovestruck teenager.

1601
01:20:47,875 --> 01:20:52,000

Yeah.

I thought you were dead.

No.

1640
01:22:57,708 --> 01:23:00,916
I was told you died
the night of the accident.
