01:16.910 --> 01:18.901
Jj

01:22.416 --> 01:23.576
Wow.

01:23.667 --> 01:27.501
Look at this big, beautiful,
blue marble of a planet,

01:27.588 --> 01:30.876
filled with billions
of super smart humans.

01:30.966 --> 01:33.582
So smart, they invented satellites.

01:33.677 --> 01:36.635
They also invented pizza,
cutting scissors,

01:36.722 --> 01:40.180
and places where you can go
to the bathroom inside!

01:40.267 --> 01:41.803
For all of their brilliance,

01:41.893 --> 01:44.259
most of them don't know
the one simple thing

01:44.354 --> 01:46.390
that every dog on earth knows...

01:46.481 --> 01:49.063
The secret to being happy.

01:50.193 --> 01:52.024
Whoa-ho-ho!

01:52.112 --> 01:54.603
It's like sticking my head
out the window.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.279
Now, all you need to know

01:56.366 --> 01:59.483
is that this story is
about Ollie and his family

01:59.578 --> 02:02.365
and how they learned to think
more like me,

02:02.456 --> 02:05.698
their impossibly handsome, clever,
uncomplicated...

02:05.792 --> 02:07.828
Happy dog.

02:07.919 --> 02:11.582
Look at my super smart human.

02:11.673 --> 02:15.962
Right now, he's saving the world
with his friend who lives in China.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.544
Does it get any cooler than that?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.049
You want a piece of me?

02:22.392 --> 02:24.849
Wow. It feels so real.

02:25.854 --> 02:27.139
Xiao!

02:27.230 --> 02:28.686
Where are you?

02:28.774 --> 02:30.730
I'm on my way!

02:30.817 --> 02:32.273
Not now, Henry.

02:33.654 --> 02:34.894
Xiao, there's too many of them!

02:34.988 --> 02:36.353
Ugh!

02:36.448 --> 02:37.448
I'm almost there.

02:37.532 --> 02:39.238
Ollie! Get ready for school!

02:46.166 --> 02:48.157
- Wasn't that awesome?
- Thanks.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.333
That's the most fun I've ever had losing.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.001
Ollie, get ready for school.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.171
You can conquer the world later.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.872
Huh. Is there an echo in here?

02:55.967 --> 02:59.334
- Xiao, I gotta go.
- Me, too.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.672
Jj

03:18.699 --> 03:20.655
So, my name's Henry.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.779
- Hey, buddy. What's going on?
- And that's Oliver, my person.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.361
And this is our morning routine.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.850
Want me to scratch your belly? Yeah!

03:27.874 --> 03:30.911
Oh, I love the belly rubs,
and Ollie loves to give them.

03:32.170 --> 03:35.333
What a good boy! What a good boy!
You want your belly scratched!

03:35.424 --> 03:37.710
Something else you should know
about Oliver is,

03:37.801 --> 03:39.883
he's incredibly inventive.

03:39.970 --> 03:42.632
This is one of his more useful inventions.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.308
Pretty cool, huh?
He's pretty smart.

03:48.395 --> 03:51.558
Not like border collie smart, but smart.

03:51.648 --> 03:55.436
The food dispenser, however,
is still in research and development.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.198
Ugh.

04:04.286 --> 04:07.198
That handsome man is Lukas, Ollie's dad.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.154
He's about to drink liquid death,

04:09.249 --> 04:11.991
because he thinks
it'll make him smarter, taller,

04:12.085 --> 04:15.373
thinner, younger,
or, I don't know, blonder.

04:15.464 --> 04:19.377
You can't improve on perfection, Lukas.
Take it from someone who knows!

04:19.468 --> 04:21.254
I love human insecurities.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.177
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.176
Fall asleep on the couch again?

04:27.267 --> 04:31.431
Uh... yeah, I was...
I was just reading.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.183
Hey, you want some green goo?
Feed your brain, feed your life?

04:34.274 --> 04:35.935
- No, I'm good.
- No? Ellen?

04:36.026 --> 04:37.253
Feed your brain,
feed your life. Come on.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.609
- No, I'm good.
- It's so good.

04:39.696 --> 04:42.403
Don't think he understands
what good means.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.719
Oh, hey, we got the roofer coming at 6:00
tonight, so we gotta make sure...

04:44.743 --> 04:46.804
Oh, no, remember?
I already told you I can't do that.

04:46.828 --> 04:47.908
- You did?
- Yeah...

04:47.996 --> 04:51.204
That's Ellen, Ollie's mom.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.282
I kinda think of her as my mom, too,

04:53.376 --> 04:57.619
because she's the one
that picked me. I love her.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.858
Yeah, I'm booked at the salon.

04:58.882 --> 05:01.043
I've got cracked heels and chipped nails
out the wazoo.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.999
- What's a wazoo?
- It's your keister.

05:03.094 --> 05:05.961
You know, like junk in the trunk.
A badonkadonk.

05:06.056 --> 05:07.171
It's your Booty.

05:07.265 --> 05:09.722
That thing you drag
on the carpet when it itches?

05:11.394 --> 05:13.430
So, what're we gonna do
about the roof?

05:13.522 --> 05:15.103
I don't know.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.807
Well, I guess I'll have to reschedule.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.267
Do you need me to do it?

05:20.362 --> 05:22.444
Oh, okay, what's that supposed to mean?

05:22.531 --> 05:23.862
Ding! Pop quiz.

05:23.949 --> 05:26.611
What species
never has arguments like this?

05:26.701 --> 05:28.066
- You know what?
- Exactly.

05:28.161 --> 05:29.867
I'll handle it. All good.

05:29.955 --> 05:31.616
So we're good on the roof?

05:31.706 --> 05:33.037
- Yeah.
- Yup.

05:33.124 --> 05:35.365
Okay. Can I go to li's
after the science fair?

05:35.460 --> 05:38.202
- Oh, my god! The science fair, Ollie.
- That's today?

05:38.296 --> 05:39.899
- Science fair's today?
- It's cool, guys.

05:39.923 --> 05:41.959
You're dealing with the roofer error.

05:42.050 --> 05:45.713
Ollie, are you 100% sure that if we don't
come to the science fair,

05:45.804 --> 05:46.884
you're gonna be okay?

05:46.972 --> 05:48.007
I'm fine.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.506
Oh... okay, let's go.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.592
- Bye, dad.
- All right.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.178
- Good luck at the fair!
- Thanks!

05:56.273 --> 05:58.389
Bye, Henry!

06:01.528 --> 06:04.691
Cue opening the 'frig for what he's
actually gonna eat.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.692
But first, as always,

06:06.783 --> 06:10.401
he's gonna try to convince me
that he hasn't already decided.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.366
Yummy life? Long life?

06:14.457 --> 06:15.810
You and I both know
it's the pizza.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.415
Yummy, long? Long, yummy?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.911
Wow. Didn't see that one coming.

06:21.006 --> 06:26.091
Liquid death, or the best triangle-shaped
food of the planet.

06:26.177 --> 06:28.042
And that includes pie.

06:29.306 --> 06:31.718
Jj

06:34.227 --> 06:37.811
Oh, Romeo, Romeo,
wherefore art thou, Romeo?

06:37.898 --> 06:40.810
Deny thy father, refuse thy name.

06:40.901 --> 06:45.361
Or if not, thy will not be sworn my love.

06:45.447 --> 06:49.690
Staring like a psychopath is not
a substitute for asking her to the dance.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.366
"Tis but thy name is my enemy.

06:53.538 --> 06:56.200
Ollie, you need to grow a pair,
and ask her out.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.872
Were he not called Romeo,

07:00.962 --> 07:02.732
- retain the...
- Never mind, you're not ready.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.496
Sophie needs a man.

07:04.591 --> 07:07.003
Preferably,
a Chinese-American man.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.550
Know of any?

07:09.638 --> 07:10.844
Oliver!

07:11.848 --> 07:14.089
But soft!

07:14.184 --> 07:16.266
What light through
yonder window breaks?

07:16.353 --> 07:20.687
It is the east and Sophie
is the brilliant sun.

07:23.026 --> 07:25.517
As enchanting as Sophie is...

07:25.612 --> 07:27.523
She's sitting over there,
by the way...

07:27.614 --> 07:31.732
The character's name is Juliet,
as in Romeo and?

07:31.826 --> 07:33.817
Jj

07:35.455 --> 07:37.411
Stop staring!

07:37.499 --> 07:40.241
Li was more convincing playing Juliet
than you were playing Romeo.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.701
Aww... thank you!

07:42.796 --> 07:44.411
I was being facetious.

07:44.506 --> 07:46.292
Hey, a compliment's a compliment.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.874
Jj

08:06.194 --> 08:08.480
Your experiment's
about reading someone's brain waves?

08:08.571 --> 08:10.527
Not exactly. It's...

08:10.615 --> 08:14.358
It's about amplifying
the electrical disturbances in...

08:14.452 --> 08:16.943
Here's something disturbing for you.

08:17.038 --> 08:21.782
I'm going to crush you
like Edison did Tesla.

08:24.295 --> 08:26.126
Heh.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.958
He got to you, didn't he?

08:32.053 --> 08:35.260
Totally. It sucks being nerds
at a nerd school.

08:36.515 --> 08:39.383
Welcome to the mills school
of science and technology's

08:39.477 --> 08:42.309
15th annual great minds symposium.

08:45.525 --> 08:50.019
And this year, we are honored
to have our benefactor,

08:50.113 --> 08:53.196
the technological pioneering genius,

08:53.283 --> 08:55.365
your hero and mine,

08:55.452 --> 08:57.568
Mr. ram mills.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.372
That's Mr. mills! The Mr. mills!

09:09.299 --> 09:11.915
Okay, okay. Okay.

09:13.219 --> 09:16.677
As I look out at the bright,
beautiful faces

09:16.765 --> 09:19.632
filled with hopes and dreams,

09:19.726 --> 09:22.638
it reminds me of myself
as a young man.

09:24.230 --> 09:27.643
Except the faces were a little darker
and hope was non-existent.

09:29.903 --> 09:32.189
Now, if you wanna make
a positive impact in this world,

09:32.280 --> 09:34.987
you're gonna have
to string together some thoughts.

09:35.075 --> 09:38.238
You're gonna have to lift
your head up from your phones

09:38.328 --> 09:41.115
and listen and learn from each other.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.448
You are the eyes of the future.

09:44.542 --> 09:46.999
You are the minds of the future.

09:47.087 --> 09:50.955
But most of all, you are
the beating heart of the future.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.791
And I want to listen and learn from you!

09:53.885 --> 09:55.796
So, let's see some science!

09:59.599 --> 10:01.885
Our first student, will younger,

10:01.976 --> 10:05.889
has an experiment concerning
electromagnetic energy.

10:11.069 --> 10:13.355
Hi.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.903
An electromagnet
is like a regular magnet,

10:15.990 --> 10:18.276
except with a lot more power.

10:18.368 --> 10:22.611
But it will have no magnetic pull
once the electricity is turned off.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.411
You're a turn-off.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.166
When the electromagnet on my helmet

10:29.254 --> 10:31.210
is charged by the transformer,

10:31.297 --> 10:33.083
it will create enough magnetic energy

10:33.174 --> 10:35.460
to lift me off the ground
to the metal bar above me.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.721
Assistant? Please engage.

10:49.440 --> 10:50.475
Mom!

10:52.569 --> 10:54.089
Mom!

10:56.072 --> 10:59.155
Don't worry, honey.
Mommy knows what to do.

10:59.242 --> 11:01.449
- Not good.
- No, no, no! No!

11:06.583 --> 11:08.164
Oh my god, honey!

11:08.251 --> 11:09.491
Help!

11:09.586 --> 11:11.542
Hang on, sweetie!

11:11.629 --> 11:13.665
We're gonna get you down!

11:13.756 --> 11:16.213
No! No!

11:16.301 --> 11:18.667
- Leave it!
- Mom!

11:18.761 --> 11:21.503
You pull this, he falls.

11:21.598 --> 11:22.598
Get down here!

11:26.436 --> 11:28.848
On your Mark, get set. Go!

11:28.938 --> 11:31.725
Like each of you, I once took
soccer as an elective.

11:31.816 --> 11:33.272
And I loved it.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.897
And before I knew it,
I got drafted by Miami.

11:36.988 --> 11:40.071
This is a soccer ball, gentlemen.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.616
You're gonna kick the ball
into that net.

11:43.703 --> 11:44.818
Okay?

11:44.913 --> 11:47.404
Pre-visualization is the key.

11:48.625 --> 11:52.163
If you can see it, you can be it.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.706
Okay? Great. All right.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.040
Yes, Rodney?

11:59.135 --> 12:03.344
So... can we use our hands or not?

12:04.349 --> 12:06.590
You can't touch the soccer ball.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.324
- But you're holding it.
- I'm holding it because I'm demonstrat...

12:09.395 --> 12:10.635
You have to kick the ball.

12:10.730 --> 12:15.315
You're gonna kick this ball
into that net. Right?

12:15.401 --> 12:18.484
Right. Okay, good, let's-let's go.
Let's get out there.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.315
What did I... no. No hands.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.907
- Come on, guys.
- Coach Reed.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.613
Hey. Yes, sir.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.289
Hunter Williams,
Springfield university.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.619
More importantly,
big fan from your Miami days.

12:35.713 --> 12:36.873
Oh, thank you.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.171
You got a minute?

12:41.135 --> 12:42.420
Sorry, coach.

12:42.512 --> 12:45.470
Uh, yeah. Yeah, I do.

12:45.556 --> 12:50.676
I wonder what Ollie's up to.
Think about that a lot.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.261
What does Ollie do all day long
when I'm not around?

12:53.356 --> 12:55.517
Must be boring.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.519
Our next student won
last year's science fair

12:57.610 --> 13:01.023
by designing his own
GPS-based dog collar.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.320
Oliver Reed.

13:03.408 --> 13:06.741
- This is the one I was telling you about.
- Great.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.534
Hello, sir.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.408
I practiced this presentation
staring at a poster of you.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.741
So, if you could just be
perfectly still...

13:14.836 --> 13:16.701
And flat.

13:21.217 --> 13:24.960
In 1893, Alexander Graham bell
said that thoughts are formed

13:25.054 --> 13:29.047
by creating electrical currents
or disturbances in the brain.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.723
So, it stands to reason

13:30.810 --> 13:35.019
that if we could amplify
those electrical disturbances,

13:35.106 --> 13:38.189
we should be able to hear
another person's thoughts.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.421
- You're right. This kid is special.
- Who wants to volunteer

13:40.445 --> 13:44.484
to have their thoughts,
one thought, read?

13:44.574 --> 13:45.734
I'll do it.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.113
- Just stay still.
- Okay.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.943
With today's technology,

13:51.039 --> 13:56.250
reading one thought,
just one word, is achievable.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.543
Brayden, please think of a color.

13:58.629 --> 14:00.415
Which one?

14:00.506 --> 14:02.087
Well, if I told you, then I'd know.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.006
Oh, right. Thinking.

14:07.472 --> 14:10.214
Brayden, just focus on the color.

14:10.308 --> 14:12.765
The rest of your mind
needs to be blank.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.347
Jj

14:24.947 --> 14:27.108
- Blue.
- Blue!

14:30.453 --> 14:31.659
It was blue, wasn't it?

14:36.042 --> 14:39.580
Oh, well, not exactly.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.856
What do you mean, not exactly?

14:40.880 --> 14:45.089
I was actually thinking green.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.462
Blue and green
are two different colors, bro.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.451
I think Oliver deserves
a round of applause for a great effort.

14:52.475 --> 14:54.511
No, it's not a great effort.
It works!

14:54.602 --> 14:56.138
This is not an effort! It works!

14:56.229 --> 14:57.594
I can prove it!

14:59.065 --> 15:01.556
It does work!

15:01.651 --> 15:04.893
It's not funny! I know it works!

15:04.987 --> 15:06.693
I tested it!

15:06.781 --> 15:08.817
It was blue!

15:11.327 --> 15:13.443
Wow. Springfield university.

15:13.538 --> 15:16.826
This is... this is big for you.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.407
This is a real college-coaching job.

15:19.502 --> 15:21.208
- That's what you always wanted.
- I know.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.752
Well, they need an answer
by Saturday, so...

15:23.840 --> 15:27.799
By this Saturday?
Because that's fast.

15:27.885 --> 15:30.467
It's only three hours away,
so, you know, I can...

15:30.555 --> 15:31.761
I know.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.631
Where would that leave us?

15:38.938 --> 15:41.224
I don't know.

15:45.027 --> 15:47.643
Where are we now?

15:47.738 --> 15:50.980
Things aren't better. You know that.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.279
You want the job, just take the job.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.017
Hey, this is a decision
we both have to make.

15:59.041 --> 16:00.361
- Hi, baby.
- Hey.

16:02.253 --> 16:05.791
- So, how was the science fair?
- It was fine.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.747
- Are you hungry?
- No.

16:10.887 --> 16:14.505
- Are you okay, Ollie?
- Yep. 'Night.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.725
Well, he's probably just tired.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.394
Yeah, that makes two of us.

16:35.828 --> 16:39.286
I can't believe I blew it
in front of Mr. mills.

16:44.754 --> 16:46.415
I love you too, Henry.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.786
Hey.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.207
- How did the experiment go?
- It didn't go. Nothing happened.

16:51.302 --> 16:54.794
- My calculations were right. I knew it.
- You knew what?

16:54.889 --> 16:57.255
Your home computer cluster
doesn't have the capabilities

16:57.350 --> 16:59.966
to process the brain's
electrical charges.

17:00.061 --> 17:03.224
In order to read minds,
we need a massive processor.

17:03.314 --> 17:06.101
Does Amazon have it?
Be here in two days.

17:06.192 --> 17:11.561
For sure. Or, I could simply
hack into... indium 6!

17:11.656 --> 17:14.647
- Yeah, right.
- Isn't that killer?

17:14.742 --> 17:15.821
Wait, what?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.275
Isn't that killer?

17:17.369 --> 17:20.657
You'd access the world's most powerful
communications satellite?

17:20.748 --> 17:24.536
- Isn't that...?
- No! There's nothing killer about it!

17:24.627 --> 17:27.664
- By access, do you mean...
- Tap right into that bad boy.

17:27.755 --> 17:30.747
Do you have any idea
how much trouble we could be in?

17:30.841 --> 17:32.206
Hey. If you land in juvie,

17:32.301 --> 17:36.260
the very first day there, you beat up the
biggest guy in the joint.

17:36.347 --> 17:39.885
Do that, the next five years
will be a walk in the park.

17:39.976 --> 17:42.342
Oliver! You need to grow a pair!

17:42.436 --> 17:43.747
Why does everyone keep telling me that?

17:43.771 --> 17:45.432
Why does everyone
keep telling me that?

17:45.523 --> 17:49.186
- Are you ready for epic?
- Yeah, but...

17:50.278 --> 17:52.690
Who's gonna wear the transmitter?

17:55.241 --> 17:57.732
Jj

18:04.959 --> 18:07.621
Okay, xiao. I'm all set up.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.454
Still would be better
if we had a human.

18:10.548 --> 18:13.506
- Henry's human enough for me.
- Okay, fine.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.050
Maybe Henry's limited brain will work.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.512
Connecting you to indium 6.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.840
Limited brain?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.515
Typical two-legged reaction

18:23.603 --> 18:27.346
when faced with a superior intellect,
such as mine.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.520
Almost there.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.190
Pairing in three...

18:31.277 --> 18:32.483
Two...

18:32.570 --> 18:33.855
One!

18:36.282 --> 18:39.240
Oliver? Oliver!

18:43.372 --> 18:45.863
Jj

18:47.793 --> 18:50.500
Uh, Ollie, I can taste my own tongue.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.078
Should that be a thing?

18:56.177 --> 18:57.633
Oliver!

19:00.014 --> 19:03.472
Is it hot? 'Cause I think
my hair is on fire.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.319
Jj

19:39.720 --> 19:42.257
Jj

20:01.575 --> 20:02.815
Mm.

20:06.497 --> 20:09.614
Must've been
a power outage last night.

20:09.709 --> 20:13.372
I think Ollie's still sleeping,
so I'm gonna write him a little note.

20:13.462 --> 20:15.043
Okay.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.664
Are you enjoying your pizza?

20:20.803 --> 20:22.464
- Yeah.
- Mm.

20:25.516 --> 20:27.131
Do you wanna talk about last night?

20:27.226 --> 20:31.686
- About the coaching job?
- Hmm... not really.

20:31.772 --> 20:34.980
- We should talk before Saturday, though.
- Yeah. We will, I promise.

20:46.871 --> 20:50.363
Best night's sleep ever.
Memory foam is no joke.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.414
I will not soon forget... wait.

20:52.501 --> 20:56.870
Why is Ollie sleeping on my shame pillow
in the corner like an animal?

20:56.964 --> 20:58.704
Did we freaky Friday last night?

20:58.799 --> 21:01.006
Am I a person?

21:01.093 --> 21:04.677
I am not learning algebra
and I am not wearing pants!

21:04.764 --> 21:08.427
No! Still got four paws
and a hypoallergenic coat.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.132
Well, another amazing day.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.092
Wake up happy, stay happy.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.099
Go to sleep happy.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.599
Jj

21:29.747 --> 21:30.862
It worked.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.038
I wish this door did.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.582
- This is amazing!
- What's amazing?

21:36.879 --> 21:40.963
Last night, completely dejected.
This morning, near psychotic with glee.

21:41.050 --> 21:42.836
Teenagers. Am I right?

21:42.927 --> 21:44.792
- I better go check on him, though.
- Henry?

21:44.887 --> 21:46.843
I-I-I can hear
what you're thinking!

21:46.931 --> 21:49.468
- He can't be hearing what I'm thinking.
- Yes, I can, Henry!

21:49.558 --> 21:51.389
- Okay, what's two plus two?
- Four.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.092
- What's frozen water called?
- Ce.

21:53.187 --> 21:55.223
- Why would a person own a cat?
- They're adorable.

21:55.314 --> 21:58.226
Wrong, they're evil.
But you can hear what I'm thinking!

21:58.317 --> 22:00.308
I know! It's insane!

22:00.402 --> 22:02.358
Whoo! You know what, Ollie?

22:02.446 --> 22:05.028
You're gonna get every prize
that's ever been given!

22:05.115 --> 22:06.901
Maybe they'll give me a prize.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.779
Ollie, we're gonna get prizes!

22:09.870 --> 22:11.781
You taste like a genius.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.612
The satellite is so powerful,

22:13.707 --> 22:16.790
it renders full sentences in real time!

22:16.877 --> 22:19.584
It's amazing! And itchy.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.792
- Can you get this thing off my head?
- Oh, of course.

22:21.841 --> 22:25.208
Yesterday, incredible.
Today, spectacular!

22:25.302 --> 22:26.838
Tomorrow, whoo...

22:33.352 --> 22:35.593
- So, are you down?
- Down for what?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.269
Haven't you been listening?

22:37.356 --> 22:39.476
I'm right in front of you
and you choose to ignore me?

22:39.525 --> 22:41.265
Wait. Hold the bone.
Are we married?

22:41.360 --> 22:43.442
- Wait a second.
- And now you're interrupting me.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.144
Yeah, that confirms it.

22:45.239 --> 22:47.821
The satellite paired the signal
from your transmitter

22:47.908 --> 22:50.775
directly to the positive charge
in my brain!

22:50.870 --> 22:53.077
I have no idea what that means.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.529
- And I still gotta pee.
- Okay, let's go.

22:58.377 --> 23:01.540
It works! It works! Yeah!

23:03.007 --> 23:04.463
Yes! The dog talks!

23:09.054 --> 23:11.921
Yeah! Yes!

23:15.603 --> 23:18.561
How long has it been? I feel like
I haven't seen you in forever.

23:18.647 --> 23:20.729
I know, girl, I know.

23:20.816 --> 23:24.934
I do not like it when my kids get
in the way of my beautification process.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.730
So, Jasmine, what do you want today?

23:28.824 --> 23:30.530
I want to look like you.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.997
You should've seen your face!

23:41.837 --> 23:44.579
Now, why would I wanna
look like you, hmm?

23:44.673 --> 23:48.962
What does your man grab onto?
There is no junk in the trunk.

23:49.053 --> 23:52.341
Hey, I got a badonkadonk.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.844
- Is Lukas still asking about me?
- Constantly.

23:55.935 --> 23:57.220
Mm-hmm. How's he doin'?

23:57.311 --> 24:00.303
Uh... we're in, like,
a little bit of a slump.

24:00.397 --> 24:01.978
Okay, what's goin' on?

24:03.651 --> 24:07.769
We used to ignite each other
and that's, um...

24:09.114 --> 24:11.400
It's-it's faded a little.

24:13.744 --> 24:16.986
- We're thinking about separating.
- No!

24:17.081 --> 24:20.164
But you guys seem
so great together. Like, solid.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.375
- Did he cheat on you?
- No.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.249
- You cheatin' on him?
- No.

24:26.340 --> 24:29.753
- Well, then what happened?
- Life?

24:31.345 --> 24:32.460
Huh.

24:35.891 --> 24:37.811
Well, do you think he'd cheat with me?

24:38.769 --> 24:39.769
Probably.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.437
Jj

24:50.155 --> 24:51.270
Okay, people, listen up.

24:51.365 --> 24:53.481
Intel has just received
a computer notification

24:53.575 --> 24:55.156
from satellite indium 6.

24:55.244 --> 24:57.735
This is a level 2 cyber-attack.

24:57.830 --> 24:59.115
If indium 6 is compromised,

24:59.206 --> 25:01.184
we're looking at a collapse
of the banking industry

25:01.208 --> 25:03.699
and loss of cell service nationwide.

25:03.794 --> 25:05.455
Total chaos.

25:05.546 --> 25:08.458
Sir? 1-6 has been breached.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.248
This is now a level 1.

25:12.720 --> 25:15.382
This is bad, right?

25:17.099 --> 25:18.660
I can't believe this is happening!

25:18.684 --> 25:21.016
Why? We go
to the park all the time.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.389
Oh! You meant
the hearing-my-thoughts thing.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.266
Sorry. My bad.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.348
But listen, you can't tell anybody.

25:27.443 --> 25:29.058
- Why not?
- Because until now,

25:29.153 --> 25:32.816
this has only happened in the movies
or the minds of the criminally insane.

25:32.906 --> 25:36.649
Dude, how did you not know
what "wazoo" means?

25:36.744 --> 25:38.860
You've been able to understand me
this entire time?

25:38.954 --> 25:41.036
- Of course.
- So you're telling me

25:41.123 --> 25:44.661
that all dogs can understand all humans.

25:44.752 --> 25:47.789
Duh. But you can't tell anybody.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.496
- Now, don't embarrass me in the park.
- What?

25:50.591 --> 25:53.879
Look, if I drop a deuce,
don't pick it up right away.

25:53.969 --> 25:56.335
If you sculpted a masterpiece

25:56.430 --> 25:59.763
and I immediately covered it
with a plastic bag,

25:59.850 --> 26:02.262
- how would you feel?
- Sorry.

26:02.352 --> 26:04.968
Oh, and dogs like fetch.
But the fake-out?

26:05.064 --> 26:07.271
- Not cool.
- I thought it was funny.

26:07.357 --> 26:09.268
Funny, how? Funny like I'm a clown?

26:09.359 --> 26:11.099
Like I'm here to amuse you?

26:11.195 --> 26:15.404
I pretend to throw.
You run, stop, walk in circles.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.652
Ha-ha. You think that's funny?

26:17.743 --> 26:19.608
Take a look at Debbie.
With every fake-out,

26:19.703 --> 26:23.821
she erodes the bonds of trust
between canines and humans.

26:23.916 --> 26:26.157
- She's a monster.
- Where'd the ball go?

26:26.251 --> 26:28.116
Dogs. Hate. That.

26:29.171 --> 26:30.440
I won't do it again.

26:30.464 --> 26:32.580
Cool. Ugh!

26:32.674 --> 26:35.541
Look at the four young blondes.

26:35.636 --> 26:37.501
Ted's fan club.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.759
- And they say size doesn't matter.
- Who's Ted?

26:40.849 --> 26:42.805
Oh, just Mr."I got it going on

26:42.893 --> 26:44.849
and I'll be the first
to tell you about it."

26:44.937 --> 26:46.973
- What's so special about him?
- Nothing!

26:47.064 --> 26:49.476
Unless you're into the tall,
dark and handsome thing.

26:49.566 --> 26:51.522
A perfect body with smoldering eyes,

26:51.610 --> 26:53.851
a Don juanesque mystique,

26:53.946 --> 26:55.356
and oh, yeah, he's an actor.

26:55.447 --> 26:58.405
- He's an actor?
- Yeah, and such a good one, too.

26:58.492 --> 26:59.857
Does all his own stunts.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.409
Last year, he jumped a motorcycle

27:02.496 --> 27:05.909
onto a moving school bus.
It was breathtaking!

27:05.999 --> 27:07.614
I hate him.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.415
I'm surprised dogs can feel jealousy.

27:09.503 --> 27:12.995
He jumps motorcycles!
I'm surprised you're not jealous of him.

27:13.090 --> 27:14.546
Did I mention his owner

27:14.633 --> 27:17.215
is that redheaded kid, Nicholas,

27:17.302 --> 27:19.463
who's always picking on you at school?

27:19.555 --> 27:21.546
The one who lives
in that big, white house.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.757
Okay. I got you. Check this.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.559
Hey, Ted! You want the ball?

27:27.646 --> 27:29.932
Go get it.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.518
Yeah, I get it.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.565
I get it now. It is funny.

27:34.653 --> 27:35.938
I didn't know dogs could laugh.

27:36.029 --> 27:37.644
Of course we can laugh.

27:37.739 --> 27:41.607
It's people that can't see the subtle
differences in our expressive faces.

27:41.702 --> 27:43.784
Check it. This is my laughing face.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.611
My serious face.

27:45.706 --> 27:48.072
- My hungry face.
- Oh, wow.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.203
My "despite 10,000 years of domestication,

27:50.294 --> 27:54.162
I'm still a wild animal
capable of unspeakable violence" face.

27:54.256 --> 27:56.256
- It's like one face fits all.
- Bonjour, frenchie.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.180
You're lookin'trés bien, mon chérie.

28:00.596 --> 28:02.427
That was all the French I know.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.345
Hang on. She's here.

28:04.433 --> 28:08.597
- Oh. My. God.
- I know.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.678
That's what I've been telling you.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.603
- She's...
- Stunning.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.182
- Yes, and she's...
- Extraordinary in every way.

28:15.277 --> 28:17.768
- I know. And she...
- Takes your breath away.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.980
- I know.
- Those big, beautiful eyes.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.406
- That shiny, wet nose.
- What?

28:23.493 --> 28:25.825
That nose, hand-carved by god,

28:25.913 --> 28:29.326
floating effortlessly
in a sea of apricot waves.

28:29.416 --> 28:31.186
- Are you talking about the poodle?
- Who are you talking about?

28:31.210 --> 28:34.043
The girl on her left!
That's Sophie.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.791
Wait, Sophie? The Sophie?

28:36.882 --> 28:38.747
The Sophie you wanna ask
to the dance Sophie?

28:38.842 --> 28:40.503
Yes. You know her dog?

28:40.594 --> 28:42.334
Smelled everywhere she's ever been.

28:42.429 --> 28:45.637
Now, let's lose the leash
and meet the girls.

28:45.724 --> 28:46.884
Okay.

28:48.310 --> 28:50.676
Even Ted's pee smells handsome!

28:50.771 --> 28:53.558
- I hate him.
- I'm nervous.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.190
Just gotta face your fears!

28:57.277 --> 28:59.814
- Are you insane?
- Excuse me?

28:59.905 --> 29:01.691
Oh, no, no, no, no.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.989
You're sane, totally sane.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.076
Okay. Okay.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.196
Recognizing her sanity is...

29:07.287 --> 29:09.903
It's not wrong. It's pathetic.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.707
Now, check out how it's done,
doggie style.

29:13.794 --> 29:16.251
Hey, are you a parking ticket?

29:16.338 --> 29:19.296
Because you have fine
written all over you.

29:19.383 --> 29:22.045
Be gentle!

29:22.135 --> 29:24.113
- No, I... you've somewhere to be.
- He's very scary.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.673
I get it.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.846
- What's his name?
- This is Henry.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.174
- Ask her to the dance.
- No.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.555
- Oh. Ask her if she works at Starbucks,
- Stop it!

29:32.646 --> 29:33.790
Because you like her a latte.

29:33.814 --> 29:35.350
Oh, no.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.766
She's serpentining his legs.

29:38.860 --> 29:40.942
His long, athletic legs.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.361
I wanna puke.

29:43.448 --> 29:45.655
Jj

29:45.742 --> 29:47.637
We're receiving snippets
of encoded transmissions.

29:47.661 --> 29:48.776
Stream it.

29:48.870 --> 29:52.328
Jj

29:52.416 --> 29:54.498
It's time to drop one.

29:54.584 --> 29:56.074
Seeking target.

29:57.170 --> 29:59.832
- Target acquired.
- What are they planning to hit?

30:01.341 --> 30:04.128
- The white house.
- Oh, my god.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.130
Dropping payload.

30:06.221 --> 30:09.304
Nothing
like a good revenge poop.

30:09.391 --> 30:10.506
Take that, Ted.

30:10.600 --> 30:14.718
Hey, Ollie. They say revenge
is best served cold.

30:14.813 --> 30:18.556
But I think soft and steaming
is much better. Don't you?

30:18.650 --> 30:20.561
What're you doing?

30:20.652 --> 30:23.644
No, no, no, no, no.
Ted lives here.

30:23.739 --> 30:25.695
Please [eave jt.

30:25.782 --> 30:27.693
I wanna see his face
when he comes home.

30:27.784 --> 30:30.742
My revenge!

30:30.829 --> 30:32.473
We've been able to trace
the point of origin,

30:32.497 --> 30:35.159
the ip and the physical coordinates
of the hacker.

30:35.250 --> 30:37.707
Munoz, Callen, pack your bags.

30:37.794 --> 30:39.534
Pack our bags?

30:40.839 --> 30:42.329
Shotgun!

30:42.424 --> 30:44.164
Jj

30:47.137 --> 30:49.503
Uh-huh. Yeah,
I'm looking it over right now.

30:51.850 --> 30:54.341
We're still talking it over
with the family and...

30:54.436 --> 30:55.747
Well, I should have an answer
to you by Saturday.

30:55.771 --> 30:59.889
Example 9,058. Why being a dog
is better than being a person.

30:59.983 --> 31:03.601
Dogs don't have to have "a very serious
phone conversation."

31:03.695 --> 31:07.187
No, it's not about the money,
it's about my son.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.898
Moving three hours away from him
is kind of a big decision.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.324
Wait, what?

31:11.411 --> 31:12.901
Hey, hey, Ollie.

31:13.997 --> 31:16.363
Pause the virtual,
come back to reality.

31:19.211 --> 31:20.747
Check this out.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.792
I think there's a chance
we might be moving.

31:26.968 --> 31:29.697
Hey, El, did you see that brochure,
that Springfield brochure that I was...

31:29.721 --> 31:32.463
- Are we moving?
- Um...

31:35.644 --> 31:38.681
Uh, we were gonna talk to you about that.

31:38.772 --> 31:40.262
We're not going anywhere, okay?

31:40.357 --> 31:42.348
Daddy just got a job offer out of town.

31:44.027 --> 31:47.861
So, dad, you're moving away?

31:49.157 --> 31:51.694
Look, we haven't decided
anything for sure.

31:51.785 --> 31:55.118
For sure?
Well, what's to decide about?

31:57.999 --> 31:59.455
Are you guys splitting up?

32:00.919 --> 32:02.955
Ollie, it's complicated.

32:03.046 --> 32:04.941
Look, we're gonna go
through everything with you.

32:04.965 --> 32:07.297
No! I wanna know now.

32:11.763 --> 32:15.472
Are you? Are you?!

32:15.559 --> 32:18.642
You know things haven't been perfect
between your mom and I.

32:18.728 --> 32:19.914
I thought you were working on it.

32:19.938 --> 32:23.271
We were, we are. It's just sometimes...

32:23.358 --> 32:26.395
I don't understand.
I thought things got better.

32:26.486 --> 32:29.148
- They were. They are.
- It doesn't sound like that.

32:29.239 --> 32:31.025
Look, we've got a few days
to decide, okay?

32:31.116 --> 32:33.094
I just didn't wanna scare you
before we knew what was real.

32:33.118 --> 32:34.733
It sounds pretty real to me!

32:37.164 --> 32:38.825
I thought we told each other everything.

32:40.834 --> 32:42.699
Why did that have to change?

32:45.589 --> 32:48.171
Ollie!

32:48.258 --> 32:50.795
Jj

33:24.961 --> 33:26.917
Ollie, can I come in?

33:27.005 --> 33:29.417
Ollie, let's talk for a minute. Come on.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.932
Ollie, we're a team.
I got your back.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.941
Look, I know
this is scary and confusing.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.564
It is for me too, buddy.

33:52.572 --> 33:54.153
Why didn't I know?

33:55.158 --> 33:57.490
Why didn't anyone tell me?

33:57.577 --> 33:59.738
- It's not fair.
- You're right, it's not fair.

33:59.829 --> 34:02.616
I should have told you.
We should have told you.

34:02.707 --> 34:04.823
But we didn't because...

34:06.628 --> 34:08.947
We didn't wanna tell you
before we knew for sure exactly...

34:09.005 --> 34:10.666
Before what?

34:10.757 --> 34:14.420
Before I woke up and my dad was gone,
and we're not a family anymore?

34:14.511 --> 34:17.344
- Look, we're always gonna be a family.
- No, we won't.

34:17.429 --> 34:22.174
Yes, we will.
Everything is gonna work out, okay?

34:22.268 --> 34:23.804
Even if I live in a different house,

34:23.895 --> 34:27.808
your mom and I love you
more than anything on planet earth.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.264
And that is never, ever gonna change.

34:35.072 --> 34:38.190
I believe that you believe that, but...

34:38.284 --> 34:39.695
I'm not sure that I do.

34:45.333 --> 34:48.541
Scoot over, would you?

34:48.628 --> 34:51.119
Jj

34:53.507 --> 34:55.089
It's gonna be fine, kid.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.131
Everything's gonna be okay.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.522
What's the matter with your neck?

35:12.652 --> 35:14.062
I got a pinched nerve.

35:15.572 --> 35:16.982
Mm.

35:18.908 --> 35:20.694
Oh, my god!

35:20.785 --> 35:23.322
Callen! Are you insane?

35:23.413 --> 35:26.075
Are you in pain?

35:26.166 --> 35:28.202
No, it's gone.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.908
How did you...

35:30.003 --> 35:32.039
Well, my mother suffered
from chronic back pain.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.246
It broke my heart, so I flew
to China and attended

35:34.341 --> 35:36.502
the Beijing university
of Chinese medicine.

35:36.593 --> 35:38.299
You went to university in Beijing?

35:38.386 --> 35:41.970
Well, I'd spent almost a year
in Shanghai learning the language first.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.547
You speak Chinese?

35:50.357 --> 35:53.975
My mother's been pain free
for 25 years, by the way.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.229
Thanks for asking.

35:59.574 --> 36:02.065
Jj

36:10.794 --> 36:14.707
Henry? I'm scared. Ry

36:14.798 --> 36:15.913
me too.

36:16.925 --> 36:18.711
Wait, what are we scared about?

36:18.802 --> 36:21.418
- Divorce.
- Why is that bad?

36:22.847 --> 36:25.008
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.931
Dogs don't have divorce.

36:27.018 --> 36:30.101
I've heard the word before,
but I don't get the concept.

36:32.732 --> 36:36.316
It's the worst thing
that could happen to a family.

36:36.403 --> 36:38.815
It's the end.

36:38.905 --> 36:41.487
It means nothing will ever be the same.

36:41.574 --> 36:44.065
Wait. Will they send me
back to the store?

36:46.830 --> 36:50.869
Henry, no matter where I am,
that's where you'll be.

36:53.211 --> 36:55.372
Because best friends stick together.

36:56.631 --> 36:57.871
Wait, what?

36:57.966 --> 37:00.457
- I'm your best friend?
- Yeah.

37:00.552 --> 37:04.295
You and I have been inseparable
since I was six.

37:04.389 --> 37:08.507
- We're a team.
- Oh! We are best friends!

37:08.601 --> 37:12.469
Do you know how long I have waited
to hear you say that?

37:12.564 --> 37:16.432
Forty-two years.
Well, 42 in dog years.

37:16.526 --> 37:18.812
But it is true what the old dogs say.

37:18.903 --> 37:21.394
The second half is the better half!

37:21.489 --> 37:25.027
Woo! Whoa.
How do I jump this high? Friendship.

37:25.118 --> 37:27.609
You. Me. Mano a mano.

37:27.704 --> 37:30.787
- Ollie, we are gonna save this family.
- How?

37:30.874 --> 37:32.535
You see this hypoallergenic tail?

37:34.294 --> 37:37.286
Really, Ollie? You choose
to ruin a nice moment like this

37:37.380 --> 37:38.916
with a really bad allergy joke?

37:39.007 --> 37:42.625
At least you could have the decency
to cover your mouth like this

37:42.719 --> 37:44.129
so you don't spread any germs.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.614
There's no such thing
as a cold-and-flu season...

37:45.638 --> 37:47.003
- Henry?
- Yeah?

37:47.098 --> 37:48.759
Saving our family?

37:48.850 --> 37:50.340
Oh. Yeah. Okay, right.

37:50.435 --> 37:53.302
As I was saying, see this tail?
Wag don't lie.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.187
I'm always happy.
You know why that is?

37:56.274 --> 37:59.311
And before you say
it's because I'm charming and eloquent...

37:59.402 --> 38:00.962
Thank you, by the way.
That is so sweet.

38:01.029 --> 38:03.065
- Sure.
- That's not it.

38:03.156 --> 38:04.692
I'm always happy

38:04.783 --> 38:08.275
because I can pee anywhere
I want, which is awesome.

38:08.369 --> 38:12.328
I got a roof over my head,
and I got a family that loves me.

38:12.415 --> 38:14.906
What else could I possibly need?

38:15.001 --> 38:17.492
Oh, oh! Remember when we lived
in that tiny house

38:17.587 --> 38:20.374
- and dad had that beat-up rv?
- Yeah.

38:20.465 --> 38:23.047
We were happy because we had
everything we needed...

38:23.134 --> 38:24.624
Each other.

38:24.719 --> 38:29.053
See, when humans grow up,
they start to focus on the wrong things

38:29.140 --> 38:31.802
and forget about what matters.

38:31.893 --> 38:35.226
Ollie, what are
the two most important things in life?

38:35.313 --> 38:37.144
- Uh...
- Close! But wrong.

38:37.232 --> 38:40.099
Love and family. That's it.

38:40.193 --> 38:43.401
It's simple. Dogs are simple.

38:43.488 --> 38:45.979
We don't complicate things
like humans do.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.565
- What are you saying?
- Really?

38:48.660 --> 38:50.012
You're supposed to be the smart one.

38:50.036 --> 38:52.823
I'm saying we need to help
mom and dad

38:52.914 --> 38:56.156
get back to that tiny house
with the beat-up rv.

38:56.251 --> 38:59.243
Simple life, happy life.

38:59.337 --> 39:03.171
We need to teach mom and dad
how to think like a dog.

39:03.258 --> 39:04.714
Henry!

39:05.844 --> 39:07.425
- It's perfect.
- I know.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.003
- I love you, Henry.
- I'm loveable.

39:10.098 --> 39:13.465
This is gonna work!
We're gonna save our family.

39:16.563 --> 39:19.805
Hi, cutie. I made you
your favorite breakfast.

39:19.899 --> 39:22.140
- Eggs in a hole!
- You made breakfast?

39:22.235 --> 39:24.317
Yeah!

39:24.404 --> 39:26.816
Hey, I was thinking
that maybe tonight, after school,

39:26.906 --> 39:28.942
- we could go out and see...
- Tonight?

39:29.033 --> 39:30.648
We never go out on a school night.

39:30.743 --> 39:32.074
Maybe we should!

39:32.161 --> 39:33.867
Why did you and dad
stop loving each other?

39:38.585 --> 39:42.294
Mm... baby, we do love each other...

39:42.380 --> 39:44.211
Then why are you splitting up?

39:46.593 --> 39:48.549
It's hard to explain.

39:48.636 --> 39:52.504
Ollie, we are a family
that loves each other.

39:52.599 --> 39:55.557
Nothing can break that bond. Ever.

39:57.186 --> 39:58.767
Okay.

40:00.815 --> 40:02.555
- I love you.
- I love you.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.643
- I don't wanna be late.
- Okay.

40:06.738 --> 40:08.399
- Can you save this for me?
- Mm-hmm.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.940
- Bye, baby.
- Bye, mom.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.071
- Bye, Henry!
- Bye, best friend!

40:14.162 --> 40:16.653
Jj

40:31.137 --> 40:33.628
Jj

40:44.067 --> 40:47.104
Well, if you do decide
to sell this house,

40:47.195 --> 40:49.186
you will be looking at multiples.

40:49.280 --> 40:52.568
Sell this house?
The roof over our head?

40:52.659 --> 40:55.366
Well, do you think maybe
we should spruce things up a little bit?

40:55.453 --> 40:58.115
No, I wouldn't worry about that, Ellen.

40:58.206 --> 41:01.573
- Most people will just gut the interior.
- What, I'm sorry?

41:01.668 --> 41:04.580
Gut it? Like, just throw away
all the work that we've done here?

41:04.671 --> 41:07.162
Oh, yeah, people do it all the time!

41:07.256 --> 41:09.963
People like new stuff.

41:10.051 --> 41:12.167
Well, I can see I'm gonna have to nip

41:12.261 --> 41:14.593
this lady's dream
of a commission in the bud.

41:14.681 --> 41:18.219
- So Oliver doesn't know?
- No. It's a lot for him to handle.

41:18.309 --> 41:22.427
It's a lot for all of us to handle and...
She doesn't care.

41:32.699 --> 41:34.815
- Oliver?
- Yes?

41:34.909 --> 41:38.322
Hi, Oliver, I'm Bridget.
I work with Mr. mills.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.825
- Look at that, just like a grown-up.
- Nice to meet you.

41:40.915 --> 41:42.643
I hope you don't mind
I pulled you out of class.

41:42.667 --> 41:45.875
No. Is Mr. mills here?

41:45.962 --> 41:50.672
Virtually. But he did want me to tell you
how impressed he was with your experiment.

41:50.758 --> 41:54.250
In fact, he said that you reminded him
of himself when he was your age.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.631
- Really? He-he did?
- He did.

41:56.723 --> 41:58.463
He wanted me to give you this.

41:58.558 --> 42:01.300
Should be hitting the market
in about eight months.

42:01.394 --> 42:02.884
On.

42:02.979 --> 42:04.219
Hey, Oliver.

42:04.313 --> 42:08.181
Listen, I'm so sorry I couldn't be there
fo give this to you in person,

42:08.276 --> 42:11.359
but I'm about to give the keynote speech
at the tech summit in China.

42:11.446 --> 42:16.531
So, please accept our latest xm quantum
book with my compliments.

42:16.617 --> 42:21.077
And remember,
great minds need great tools.

42:21.164 --> 42:23.655
- Thank you so much, Mr. mills.
- Oliver.

42:25.293 --> 42:27.284
That's the virtual part, remember?

42:27.378 --> 42:29.289
Oh, right. Thank you.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.416
You have an extraordinary mind, Oliver.

42:31.507 --> 42:33.463
Thanks, but I can't take all the credit.

42:33.551 --> 42:36.042
My friend xiao is crazy smart
with computers.

42:36.137 --> 42:39.095
Really? Tell me about him.

42:40.141 --> 42:42.678
Jj

43:03.247 --> 43:05.488
Hello, xiao. Mr. mills here.

43:05.583 --> 43:06.663
Good to see you.

43:06.751 --> 43:09.271
I've become quite impressed with the work
you're doing with Oliver Reed

43:09.295 --> 43:10.956
and I'd like to virtually invite you

43:11.047 --> 43:15.165
to be my personal guest
at the tech summit in China.

43:15.259 --> 43:19.252
Please accept our latest xm quantum book
with my compliments.

43:20.306 --> 43:22.797
Mr. mills.

43:25.228 --> 43:26.684
You are my hero.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.103
You are my super-hero!

43:34.153 --> 43:35.859
Wow!

43:41.035 --> 43:43.947
Ollie. Here, check this.

43:44.038 --> 43:45.949
- Wedding video?
- Yep, that's right.

43:46.040 --> 43:47.280
Where did you get this?

43:47.375 --> 43:48.695
Mom was digging
through some boxes

43:48.751 --> 43:51.367
and when she saw this,
she started to cry.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.703
So I figured it was important.

43:53.798 --> 43:56.665
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's my great pleasure

43:56.759 --> 44:00.001
to introduce for the first time
as husband and wife,

44:00.096 --> 44:02.257
Ellen and Lukas Reed!

44:09.480 --> 44:12.563
Ugh! Why do you guys kiss? It's gross.

44:12.650 --> 44:14.686
Why do you guys sniff each other's butts?

44:14.777 --> 44:16.517
- It's grosser.
- Ollie...

44:18.865 --> 44:22.278
Why do you let a butt-sniffing dog
lick your face?

44:22.368 --> 44:24.859
Top that, sucker!

44:24.954 --> 44:27.536
Okay. All joking aside,

44:27.623 --> 44:29.989
I highly recommend
the butt-sniffing thing.

44:30.084 --> 44:33.668
You'd be surprised
at what one can learn about a person

44:33.754 --> 44:35.790
with one quick whiff.

44:38.217 --> 44:40.173
Huh. What song is this?

44:40.261 --> 44:43.799
Mom says it's "their song,"
whatever that means.

44:47.518 --> 44:48.883
Pause. Hit pause.

44:48.978 --> 44:50.593
- That's the look!
- What look?

44:50.688 --> 44:51.768
The love look.

44:51.856 --> 44:55.223
It's the look two people share
when they're truly in love.

44:55.318 --> 44:56.933
Wait a second.

44:57.028 --> 45:00.566
We gotta remind them of that feeling!
We gotta play them that song!

45:00.656 --> 45:03.819
- And make them share that look again!
- How?

45:03.910 --> 45:06.993
Oh! Genius! Ollie, the dance,
it's tomorrow night, right?

45:07.079 --> 45:09.946
- Yeah, but how do we get them...
- You grow a pair, invite Sophie,

45:10.041 --> 45:13.454
guarantee mom and dad
are gonna show up.

45:13.544 --> 45:15.125
How'd you get so smart, Henry?

45:15.213 --> 45:16.828
You smell as many butts as I have,

45:16.923 --> 45:18.663
you tend to pick up a few things.

45:18.758 --> 45:20.623
- Ha!
- Ladies and gentlemen,

45:20.801 --> 45:25.215
welcome to the 2019
tech summit in China.

45:25.306 --> 45:30.175
It is my pleasure to introduce
our keynote speaker,

45:30.269 --> 45:34.433
Mr. ram mills!

45:34.523 --> 45:37.014
Jj

46:04.762 --> 46:06.218
Confucius,

46:06.305 --> 46:08.591
Lao-tze, the founder of taoism,

46:08.683 --> 46:10.298
zou yan, the founder of naturalism,

46:10.393 --> 46:12.509
zhao mendong,
the list goes on and on.

46:12.603 --> 46:17.142
All these great minds had
one thing in common.

46:20.027 --> 46:21.938
They all loved chocolate.

46:27.535 --> 46:29.742
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

46:29.829 --> 46:32.741
They had two things in common.

46:32.832 --> 46:39.203
Their ideas were born out of the perfect
alignment of body, mind and spirit.

46:39.297 --> 46:44.257
In 1893, Alexander Graham bell
said thoughts are formed

46:44.343 --> 46:47.506
by electrical disturbances in the brain.

46:47.596 --> 46:52.306
Now, imagine using technology
to amplify those thoughts

46:52.393 --> 46:55.180
before the ego has a chance
to manipulate them.

46:55.271 --> 46:59.014
Imagine a day being able to extract

46:59.108 --> 47:02.271
that perfect alignment,
that purity of thought.

47:02.361 --> 47:04.898
Ladies and gentlemen,
that day was not yesterday.

47:04.989 --> 47:06.604
That day is today!

47:10.369 --> 47:13.111
I'm so sorry. That took much
longer than I thought.

47:13.205 --> 47:15.434
I threw in that "purity of thought" stuff
for your benefit.

47:15.458 --> 47:16.458
Sir?

47:16.542 --> 47:18.578
Well, the work you're doing
with Oliver Reed.

47:18.669 --> 47:22.253
It'll enable mankind to effortlessly
communicate without speaking.

47:22.340 --> 47:24.831
It's the reason
I first got into this business.

47:24.925 --> 47:26.210
I'm not sure I follow.

47:26.302 --> 47:28.167
My mother had a stroke
while giving birth.

47:28.262 --> 47:30.548
I was never able to hear her voice.

47:30.639 --> 47:33.506
So, I've had a dream that one day,
through science and technology,

47:33.601 --> 47:36.092
I'd finally be able to hear her,

47:36.187 --> 47:38.599
understand her thoughts,
understand her feelings.

47:39.607 --> 47:42.269
Although both my parents are healthy,

47:42.360 --> 47:45.147
they behave as if they were mute.

47:45.237 --> 47:48.229
They talk, but they don't communicate.

47:48.324 --> 47:49.609
Mr. mills.

47:50.868 --> 47:55.111
What good is having a voice
if you don't speak your truth?

47:56.165 --> 47:58.656
Thank you for sharing that.

47:58.751 --> 48:01.743
You are a bright young man, xiao!

48:01.837 --> 48:03.873
Oh, thank you, sir.

48:03.964 --> 48:06.421
But my dad thinks I'm wasting my life.

48:06.509 --> 48:08.500
Oh, that's okay. Just be patient.

48:08.594 --> 48:12.178
Takes a while for people
to understand a visionary.

48:12.264 --> 48:14.630
Trust me. He'll come around.

48:14.725 --> 48:17.137
- Can I give you one piece of advice?
- Of course!

48:19.063 --> 48:21.770
Don't share your ideas with anyone.

48:22.900 --> 48:25.232
With anyone.

48:25.319 --> 48:27.025
Twelve years ago,
I told my friend Steve

48:27.113 --> 48:30.230
about this phone that I invented
that can also play music.

48:30.324 --> 48:32.110
We both know
what happened with that.

48:32.201 --> 48:35.659
I can assure you, there are people
watching you right now.

48:38.541 --> 48:41.032
Why? Why me?

48:42.336 --> 48:45.499
Because you're about
to shake up the world!

48:45.589 --> 48:48.376
You need anything, you only come to me.

48:48.467 --> 48:50.487
I've got a couple of billion dollars'
worth of resources.

48:50.511 --> 48:52.591
All you have to do is ask.
Just promise me one thing.

48:52.638 --> 48:53.878
Of course.

48:53.973 --> 48:56.009
Keep doing what you're doing,

48:56.100 --> 48:59.638
so no other child will have
to suffer the way we did.

48:59.728 --> 49:01.719
Jj

49:08.154 --> 49:12.693
Hey, Mr. mills, it's you! Mr. mills!

49:15.953 --> 49:17.693
Sophie?

49:17.788 --> 49:22.202
Nothing would make me happier
than having the pleasure of your company...

49:22.293 --> 49:23.874
Cut! Ugh!

49:23.961 --> 49:27.169
How did that feel to you?

49:29.967 --> 49:32.504
Frenchie feels, and I agree,
it just didn't sound like you.

49:32.595 --> 49:34.631
Felt derivative. Let's run it again.

49:34.722 --> 49:37.213
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what, Ollie?

49:37.308 --> 49:39.094
Save our family?

49:39.185 --> 49:42.348
You know what?
Let's just forget my entire brilliant plan

49:42.438 --> 49:44.474
because you're too nervous
to talk to a girl.

49:44.565 --> 49:47.056
Sound good? That's a wrap, everyone!

49:49.820 --> 49:52.482
You've got one more day
to ask Sophie to the dance.

49:52.573 --> 49:53.779
I believe in you.

49:53.866 --> 49:56.824
- You are ready to go off-leash.
- You think?

49:56.911 --> 50:00.119
I know. And there's another thing I know.

50:00.206 --> 50:01.742
That's checkmate, sucka!

50:01.832 --> 50:04.323
All this winning makes me thirsty!

50:04.418 --> 50:06.909
- Have I ever beaten you?
- At chess? No.

50:07.004 --> 50:09.495
At the 100 yard dash? Again, no.

50:09.590 --> 50:12.081
But I'm sure there must be...
Oh, hang on. Still thirsty.

50:12.176 --> 50:15.339
There must be something
that humans are better at than dogs.

50:15.429 --> 50:19.047
Oh! Are there any contests to see
who has the worst sense of smell?

50:19.141 --> 50:21.723
You guys would be shoo-ins for that.

50:21.810 --> 50:25.223
Now, listen. Starting tomorrow,
you say what you feel

50:25.314 --> 50:27.350
and you speak from your heart,
no matter what.

50:27.441 --> 50:29.102
Okay.

50:29.193 --> 50:31.684
I promise, if you do that,
Sophie will say yes,

50:31.779 --> 50:35.397
mom and dad will show up, and voila!
Let them hear you bark!

50:39.411 --> 50:43.324
This house is so small, I gotta stick
my head out to change my mind.

50:43.415 --> 50:45.121
- We'll fix that.
- Don't say fix to a dog.

50:45.209 --> 50:46.353
Not cool.

50:46.377 --> 50:48.743
Hey!

50:48.837 --> 50:50.373
I've just met with mills.

50:50.464 --> 50:53.046
I'm scared people know
about our satellite connection.

50:53.133 --> 50:55.624
- Who knows?
- Not sure.

50:55.719 --> 50:58.586
But mills warned me to be
very, very careful.

50:58.681 --> 51:00.262
We need to shut down the link.

51:00.349 --> 51:02.681
- No, we can't.
- We have to!

51:02.768 --> 51:06.602
My parents are deciding if they're gonna
split up or not in two days.

51:06.689 --> 51:08.771
I need Henry to help me fix this.

51:08.857 --> 51:10.848
Henry? How can he help?

51:10.943 --> 51:14.401
Adults are complicated,
but Henry's simple.

51:14.488 --> 51:16.479
Your face is simple.

51:16.574 --> 51:19.737
I just mean he has a simple view of life,

51:19.827 --> 51:22.159
a better view. Xiao, please.

51:22.246 --> 51:24.362
I can't let my family split up.

51:24.456 --> 51:25.912
Please, just 24 hours

51:26.000 --> 51:27.991
and then I promise I'll make this right.

51:28.085 --> 51:30.792
I'll confess. I'll do whatever I need to.

51:32.131 --> 51:35.123
You've got one day, but that's it.

51:45.686 --> 51:48.678
So this house
isn't officially on the market,

51:48.772 --> 51:52.640
but I know people, and these people
are getting a divorce.

51:52.735 --> 51:54.100
This house could be yours!

51:54.194 --> 51:56.480
That's great news!

51:56.572 --> 51:57.757
- Honey, are you okay?
- Oh, my gosh!

51:57.781 --> 52:00.693
No hard feelings, I hope.

52:00.784 --> 52:04.117
It's nothing personal.
Scratch that, it's totally personal.

52:04.204 --> 52:06.695
- Are you okay?
- She's fine. She's fine.

52:06.790 --> 52:08.746
Okay, great.
Wait 'til you see this kitchen.

52:08.834 --> 52:11.496
It's amazing. It's really beautiful.

52:11.587 --> 52:13.248
Well.

52:17.843 --> 52:22.382
- What is that smell?
- What smell?

52:22.473 --> 52:26.091
That's the smell
of zero commission.

52:26.185 --> 52:27.971
Oh, that smell.

52:28.062 --> 52:29.802
Ugh!

52:29.897 --> 52:33.389
Well, that's the kitchen.
Isn't it pretty? It's bright...

52:33.484 --> 52:34.849
Do you wanna see the backyard?

52:40.783 --> 52:42.489
Well, they're still in the kitchen.

52:45.204 --> 52:48.412
Hey, do you remember that time
Ollie was riding his bike

52:48.499 --> 52:50.410
and he fell off
and he banged up his knee?

52:50.501 --> 52:53.834
Yeah. Remember what he said?
He was like, "I'm not gonna cry!"

52:56.799 --> 52:58.755
He was a tough kid.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.000
Still is.

53:06.350 --> 53:09.592
Tell me that he's gonna be okay.

53:09.687 --> 53:11.643
He's gonna be fine.

53:12.690 --> 53:15.557
Okay? We're just gonna keep loving him
just like we always have.

53:15.651 --> 53:17.187
No matter what.

53:20.030 --> 53:22.897
I'm sorry, Ellen, I just...

53:24.159 --> 53:26.275
I feel like I could've done better.

53:27.371 --> 53:28.736
We both could have.

53:34.420 --> 53:35.751
I love you.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.538
I love you.

53:39.633 --> 53:42.045
Wait! Wait!

53:43.053 --> 53:45.965
No, no! I forgot to give you my card!

53:46.056 --> 53:48.923
What light through yonder window breaks?

53:49.017 --> 53:51.508
It is the east and...

53:51.603 --> 53:55.687
Oliver, don't forget the character's name
is Juliet, not Sophie.

54:00.946 --> 54:03.608
I tell you what.
You could say the actual words,

54:03.699 --> 54:06.111
or blurt out whatever you're thinking.

54:17.463 --> 54:20.205
Okay. Here's what I'm thinking.

54:20.299 --> 54:22.790
How many of you understand this play?

54:22.885 --> 54:25.718
- I mean, really get it?
- No.

54:26.722 --> 54:28.383
Do you understand it?

54:28.474 --> 54:30.385
- Of course I do. I'm teaching it.
- Are you?

54:30.476 --> 54:32.262
Oh!

54:32.352 --> 54:34.593
I don't think anyone here really gets it.

54:34.688 --> 54:37.521
Well, the material
might have more meaning to you

54:37.608 --> 54:39.724
if you took the time to actually study it.

54:39.818 --> 54:42.434
Or if you took the time
to actually explain it.

54:42.529 --> 54:46.943
You know, teach it to us.
So we can appreciate its meaning.

54:48.660 --> 54:52.369
- Shall I continue?
- I think so. In the principal's office.

55:02.299 --> 55:04.068
- All right, Oliver!
- Go, Oliver!

55:04.092 --> 55:06.708
Yeah!

55:06.804 --> 55:08.544
Wait!

55:08.639 --> 55:11.426
- What's our cover?
- I got this.

55:11.517 --> 55:13.678
- Just follow my lead.
- What?

55:15.187 --> 55:19.396
Hi! You must be
Mr. and Mrs... Masculine?

55:19.483 --> 55:21.439
- Did I pronounce that correctly?
- Close!

55:21.527 --> 55:24.018
My name is bailarin masculino.

55:24.112 --> 55:28.230
And this is my wife, fauna flora.

55:28.325 --> 55:30.816
She does not speak english,
but she is a dancer.

55:30.911 --> 55:33.903
And when she dances,
she speaks the language of love.

55:35.541 --> 55:36.781
Venga aqui.

55:38.293 --> 55:40.659
Oh, okay.

55:40.754 --> 55:42.745
So, this is their son's room.

55:42.840 --> 55:47.083
If there was ever a room
for a baby dancer, this would be it.

55:49.847 --> 55:51.337
Distract her. I'll do recon.

55:52.975 --> 55:55.261
My wife, she love the house.

55:55.352 --> 55:57.058
I must speak with you.

56:00.190 --> 56:01.930
Oliver! Oliver!

56:02.025 --> 56:04.516
That was the most amazing thing
I've ever seen.

56:04.611 --> 56:06.727
- What's gotten into you?
- I don't know.

56:06.822 --> 56:09.175
I guess I just wanted to say
what I was really thinking for once.

56:09.199 --> 56:11.970
Well, you should do it more often,
because everybody's talking about it.

56:11.994 --> 56:13.655
- Seriously?
- Are you kidding me?

56:13.745 --> 56:16.077
You're like a legend!
And there will be spillover cred.

56:16.164 --> 56:20.123
And I'll be by your side,
so your spillover will spill over to me

56:20.210 --> 56:21.791
hi, li. Hey, Oliver.

56:21.879 --> 56:24.837
Li's me. You know my name?

56:24.923 --> 56:27.130
Of course. You played Juliet in class.

56:27.217 --> 56:29.253
It's happening. It's already happening!

56:29.344 --> 56:31.050
The spillage is real!

56:31.138 --> 56:33.003
See you later, li.

56:33.098 --> 56:37.011
Oliver, what you said in class
is exactly what I've been thinking.

56:38.103 --> 56:39.593
That was really brave.

56:42.649 --> 56:43.809
Well, gotta go.

56:45.027 --> 56:47.268
- Sophie?
- Yes, Ollie?

56:49.698 --> 56:51.563
Sophie...

56:51.658 --> 56:53.694
Would you please
go to the dance with me?

56:55.662 --> 56:58.745
I would love to.

57:01.251 --> 57:02.661
See you tonight, Romeo.

57:05.255 --> 57:07.667
Hey, Oliver. You got a minute?

57:10.218 --> 57:11.458
I guess.

57:13.388 --> 57:15.754
Nicholas paid me to tank your experiment.

57:15.849 --> 57:18.340
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Listen, man.

57:18.435 --> 57:19.845
I've felt like crap since the fair.

57:19.937 --> 57:21.802
And then after you stood up
to Ms. shackley,

57:21.897 --> 57:25.060
well, dude, you deserve to know the truth.

57:25.150 --> 57:27.357
Thanks.

57:27.444 --> 57:30.060
Are you gonna tell Nicholas
that I told you?

57:30.155 --> 57:32.441
Nope. It wouldn't be cool, would it?

57:35.077 --> 57:36.658
See you at the dance, man.

57:36.745 --> 57:38.360
Yes, you will.

57:40.916 --> 57:44.408
- So, you wanted to talk to me?
- Yes.

57:44.503 --> 57:47.495
Your eyes, they are so sad

57:47.589 --> 57:50.331
because you have not been loved

57:50.425 --> 57:52.711
the way an angel like you
should be loved.

57:54.888 --> 57:56.970
Okay...

57:57.057 --> 57:59.799
Don't speak. Don't think.

58:03.105 --> 58:04.345
Follow.

58:21.081 --> 58:23.948
Does this thing turn on?

58:24.042 --> 58:25.498
Hey, Oliver.

58:25.585 --> 58:29.203
Listen, I'm so sorry I couldn't be there
fo give this to you in person,

58:29.297 --> 58:32.039
but I'm about to give the keynote speech
at the tech summit in China.

58:33.760 --> 58:35.091
- Nice.
- Honey, it's time to go.

58:35.178 --> 58:36.418
- Oh.
- Wait.

58:36.513 --> 58:39.158
- I thought she didn't speak english!
- She's a fast learner! Nice house!

58:39.182 --> 58:42.049
Wait! I forgot to give you my card!

58:43.353 --> 58:45.844
Jj

58:52.154 --> 58:56.488
From a rooftop in Beijing
to an oil rig in the Alaskan Gulf,

58:56.575 --> 58:59.988
we are bound by the thirst for knowledge.

59:01.163 --> 59:04.155
Mills lab's new xm quantum book

59:04.249 --> 59:07.412
will give you access to anything
you can imagine faster than...

59:08.879 --> 59:11.370
Well, faster than you can imagine it.

59:11.465 --> 59:12.955
Cut!

59:15.010 --> 59:17.092
Oh, xiao.

59:19.181 --> 59:21.092
Oh, man!

59:21.183 --> 59:22.673
This was so freaking cool.

59:22.768 --> 59:26.181
- Well, I am so glad to see you.
- Me, too.

59:26.271 --> 59:28.887
Tell me, how long have you been
a bicycle delivery boy?

59:28.982 --> 59:30.347
How did you know that?

59:30.442 --> 59:33.684
I know stuff. Come on.

59:33.862 --> 59:36.319
You were so right, Henry.

59:36.406 --> 59:37.486
I did what you said.

59:37.574 --> 59:41.533
In class, I spoke from the heart,
and it felt amazing!

59:41.620 --> 59:46.080
- Well, duh.
- I've never felt this-this grown up.

59:46.166 --> 59:49.078
Pretty soon you'll be shaving,
driving, kissing girls...

59:49.169 --> 59:50.249
Still gross.

59:50.337 --> 59:52.874
Oh! Henry, um...

59:52.964 --> 59:54.955
When you said dogs don't have divorce,

59:55.050 --> 59:57.541
- do they have marriage?
- Nothing official.

59:57.636 --> 59:59.547
We do more of a common law thing.

59:59.638 --> 01:00:03.130
- What about family?
- Family we have, and love we have.

01:00:03.225 --> 01:00:06.342
But once you're family,
you are always family.

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.289
And that never changes.

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:11.350
Okay, pop quiz. What are
the two most important things in life?

01:00:11.441 --> 01:00:13.932
Love and family. Oh!

01:00:14.027 --> 01:00:17.235
And peeing wherever you want,
which is awesome.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.608
- Do you actually?
- Oh, my god.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:24.192
- Are you messing with me?
- It works.

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:25.993
That doesn't really make sense.

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:32.167
So, you ready for this?

01:00:32.254 --> 01:00:33.994
You gonna get the 'rents
to the dance?

01:00:34.089 --> 01:00:36.796
Yep. Both at the same time.

01:00:36.883 --> 01:00:39.374
They'll be coming at exactly 9:30.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.461
And the dj's on board? He'll have the song
cued up and ready to play?

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.421
- Done.
- Impressive.

01:00:44.516 --> 01:00:47.508
Oliver Reed, you are ready
fo live off-leash!

01:00:49.146 --> 01:00:51.011
Thanks, Henry. I love you, too.

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:53.097
Now, if you wanna look sharp
for the dance,

01:00:53.191 --> 01:00:55.728
you go with that tasty blue number
with the dots.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:57.775
- You mean this one?
- Bingo.

01:00:57.863 --> 01:01:00.195
Stylin'.

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:03.010
You know, one of the things
that I love about your country

01:01:03.034 --> 01:01:05.525
is you guys can use an app
to pay for everything.

01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:07.736
- Yeah...
- You don't even need to use cash.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.571
Can you show me how that works, please?

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:11.998
Sure. It's simple.

01:01:12.085 --> 01:01:13.916
You just need to...

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.837
What is this?

01:01:17.924 --> 01:01:19.960
What did you do?

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:23.635
It's nothing. Look, I more than anyone
know how difficult it is starting out.

01:01:23.722 --> 01:01:25.713
I just wanted to make it
a little easier for you.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:30.804
Mr. mills, I don't know what to say.

01:01:30.896 --> 01:01:34.013
When you and Oliver achieve your goal,
you won't have to say anything.

01:01:34.107 --> 01:01:36.393
I'll already know what you're thinking.

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:44.149
Sir, without Oliver,
none of this could be possible.

01:01:44.242 --> 01:01:47.609
Oliver created this technology
for his family.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.569
You cannot buy that.

01:01:56.546 --> 01:01:58.457
Excuse me.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.539
Jj

01:02:06.806 --> 01:02:09.718
- Bridget. Go.
- Sir, it works. It's real.

01:02:09.809 --> 01:02:12.391
I don't know how, but he did it.

01:02:12.479 --> 01:02:15.596
Do you know what it'd mean if...

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:18.557
When I get my hands on this technology?

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:20.893
You'll get another island?
A bigger yacht?

01:02:20.987 --> 01:02:24.195
Oh, simple, simple, Bridget.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:26.614
For once, just try to think like a genius.

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:28.988
With this technology,

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:33.072
I'll know exactly
what my competitors are thinking.

01:02:33.166 --> 01:02:35.578
Every brilliant idea will be mine.

01:02:37.921 --> 01:02:40.082
I'll have a monopoly on knowledge.

01:02:40.173 --> 01:02:42.915
Sir, that-that does have
a nice ring to it.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:48.094
Okay, I'm going to have to pay
Oliver and his talking dog a little visit.

01:02:48.181 --> 01:02:50.388
Oh, and good job, simple Bridget.

01:02:51.601 --> 01:02:53.967
Expect something special
for your bonus this year.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:05.441
How 'bout mills labs? Mm?

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.523
Jj

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:11.117
- Yes?
- Great recon, munoz.

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:12.910
That laptop's proved invaluable.

01:03:12.998 --> 01:03:14.158
Thank you, sir.

01:03:14.249 --> 01:03:15.409
Intel have informed us

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:18.162
that mills has transferred $100,000

01:03:18.253 --> 01:03:21.620
into the bank account of a potential
operative in Beijing.

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:24.881
The FBI have been notified.

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:26.799
Good work, munoz.

01:03:26.886 --> 01:03:28.877
Does this mean we have corroboration?

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:30.837
We have corroboration.

01:03:30.932 --> 01:03:33.218
This is Jason bourne stuff,
and I'm Matt Damon!

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.971
That's so you.

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.667
Make way for the total package!

01:03:39.691 --> 01:03:41.932
Brains, personality, and good looks!

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:43.392
Oh, and Ollie, too.

01:03:43.486 --> 01:03:45.977
- Wow, you look cute!
- Whoa! Look at you!

01:03:46.072 --> 01:03:47.812
- Somebody's handsome.
- Thanks.

01:03:47.907 --> 01:03:50.239
- You don't think I look a little...
- Gorgeous?

01:03:50.327 --> 01:03:52.283
- No, just kinda...
- Irresistible?

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:53.906
Well, that is what I'm going for.

01:03:53.997 --> 01:03:56.033
Oh!

01:03:56.124 --> 01:03:58.456
You know how you always say
that we can learn so much

01:03:58.543 --> 01:04:00.499
from observing someone else's behavior?

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.123
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.795
I think we can learn a lot
from observing Henry.

01:04:06.426 --> 01:04:08.337
Maybe not right now.

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:10.293
Oh, a little privacy, please.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:13.972
But, haven't you noticed
how he seems happy, like, all the time?

01:04:14.059 --> 01:04:15.059
Dogs always seem happy.

01:04:15.143 --> 01:04:16.203
- Because they are!
- Because they are!

01:04:16.227 --> 01:04:17.433
- Jinx.
- Jinx.

01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:21.183
Henry and I were just talking.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:22.605
- Zip it.
- And he talked back?

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.478
Nix-nay on the alking-tay.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:26.855
Remember? Criminally insane?

01:04:26.946 --> 01:04:29.688
Never mind. The point is, they're happy

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:31.819
because they appreciate
the simple things in life.

01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:35.528
The important things,
like love and family.

01:04:36.664 --> 01:04:38.620
They don't complicate life
the way people do.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.448
I am impressive.

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.158
I can appreciate the sentiment, Ollie,

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:44.744
but when you get older,
life just isn't that simple.

01:04:44.839 --> 01:04:46.795
- But it can be.
- Sell it, my brother.

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:50.341
See, people are always
so busy searching for a better life,

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.795
they forget about the great one
they already have.

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.723
Oh! Look what I found under my bed.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.769
We had some great trips in that thing.

01:05:03.191 --> 01:05:04.871
Well, I don't wanna be late for the dance.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:06.141
You're a closer.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:07.726
Wait, baby, do you want a ride?

01:05:07.821 --> 01:05:10.528
Mom, it's six blocks. I'd rather walk.

01:05:10.615 --> 01:05:15.109
Plus, I could use the time
emotionally preparing for my...

01:05:15.203 --> 01:05:17.694
- Date.
- Boom! Nailed it!

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.245
- What?
- When did that happen?

01:05:19.332 --> 01:05:21.163
- Earlier today.
- Who's the lucky girl?

01:05:21.251 --> 01:05:23.412
Her name's Sophie. And get this...

01:05:23.503 --> 01:05:25.368
She likes me for me.

01:05:25.463 --> 01:05:27.169
Well, yeah. I mean...

01:05:27.257 --> 01:05:29.623
I don't wanna be late.
I hear girls like punctuality.

01:05:29.717 --> 01:05:32.299
You know what else they like?
Confident dancers.

01:05:32.387 --> 01:05:34.799
Dad, no, please, please stop.

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:37.471
That, right there,
that makes me proud to be a dog.

01:05:37.559 --> 01:05:39.390
- I will never unsee that.
- Oh, god.

01:05:39.477 --> 01:05:41.013
- I'm just telling you.
- I get it.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:42.665
- I should really go.
- All right, hotshot.

01:05:42.689 --> 01:05:44.429
- Call me and I'll come get you.
- Or me.

01:05:44.524 --> 01:05:47.766
- You know, whatever you want.
- Just... call me.

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:50.352
- Okay.
- My work here is finished.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:51.715
- I love you guys.
- I love you, too.

01:05:51.739 --> 01:05:52.939
- I love you.
- Henry, come on.

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:56.324
Ollie, pro tip. Don't dance like dad.

01:06:02.542 --> 01:06:05.955
- We make a good team, Henry.
- It's how best friends roll.

01:06:06.045 --> 01:06:09.833
That was some Dr. Phil,
Cesar millan-type stuff.

01:06:09.924 --> 01:06:11.380
Where did all that wisdom come from?

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:14.084
You, Henry! You!

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:16.215
Right, I know. Just checkin'.

01:06:16.306 --> 01:06:18.386
It's funny how your life can change
in just two days.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:22.884
- Hey, who are you?
- No!

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:26.312
- Let him go! Ollie!
- Hey!

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:29.141
Let me go! What's happening?

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:32.068
Let us out!
Let us out right now!

01:06:32.155 --> 01:06:34.020
Right now!

01:06:35.575 --> 01:06:37.566
Jj

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:49.369
You're lucky I didn't bite you.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:52.546
- Mr. mills?
- Nice to see you again, Oliver.

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:53.714
Oh, looky here.

01:06:53.801 --> 01:06:55.883
Eccentric billionaire
lounging in an airplane hangar.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:58.803
An alluring bond girl?
Not weird at all!

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:01.051
- What are you doing here?
- Felony kidnapping.

01:07:01.142 --> 01:07:03.508
I wanted to talk to you
about your technology.

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:04.638
Are you hungry?

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:06.369
Wait. What?
No one said there'd be shacks.

01:07:06.439 --> 01:07:08.475
No, actually, I have to get to...

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:10.727
School dance. Yeah. I know. Ahem.

01:07:10.818 --> 01:07:12.479
How did you know that?

01:07:16.658 --> 01:07:18.239
I know stuff.

01:07:20.453 --> 01:07:21.693
Why are you...?

01:07:21.788 --> 01:07:24.951
Ollie, the guy
in the tj Maxx suit has a gun.

01:07:25.041 --> 01:07:26.702
- Really?
- I may be wrong.

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:28.078
It could be men's wearhouse.

01:07:28.169 --> 01:07:30.272
I think I can make a break
for the door and go get help.

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:32.107
Just let me know when.
We don't wanna tip them off,

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:34.068
so maybe you can give me
some kind of subtle sign.

01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:36.028
Maybe you could scratch
your elbow or touch your nose, wiggle...

01:07:36.052 --> 01:07:37.588
- Now!
- That works. Bye!

01:07:37.679 --> 01:07:40.386
- Get the dog!
- Henry!

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:42.054
Henry, go! Run!

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:43.381
Don't kill him!

01:07:43.476 --> 01:07:45.467
- I need him!
- Henry!

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:48.304
- Move!
- Henry, run!

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:49.854
Move!

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.897
You sure you're not hungry?

01:08:12.505 --> 01:08:16.247
Boy, I wish that airplane hangar
was closer to home!

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:19.334
Woo! I really need to up my cardio.

01:08:19.429 --> 01:08:22.216
Okay, this is big.
This is a big, serious situation

01:08:22.307 --> 01:08:24.013
and I can't do it alone.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.591
I need help. I need a dog, or two.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:29.644
I need three do... I need all...
I need my dogs!

01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:34.395
Frenchie! Drop the macaroons
for two seconds

01:08:34.484 --> 01:08:35.895
and come to the window.

01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:39.524
My human's in trouble
and I need your help to save him.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.736
How should I know?

01:08:42.827 --> 01:08:45.785
It's your house. Try the back door!

01:08:49.334 --> 01:08:51.040
Henry, he's your best friend.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.493
You have to be willing to do
anything to save him.

01:08:53.587 --> 01:08:55.328
Anything. Even this.

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:57.584
Ted! Can I talk to you for a second?

01:08:57.675 --> 01:08:59.415
It's important!

01:09:01.220 --> 01:09:04.006
Okay, my human is in trouble
and I need your help.

01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:06.339
Oh, didn't know you were having
an awesome party.

01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:08.220
[I don't care!

01:09:08.310 --> 01:09:09.676
Shut up! I need your help!

01:09:09.770 --> 01:09:13.184
Meet me around the corner
in 30 seconds. Please.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:17.934
Skittles!

01:09:18.029 --> 01:09:21.066
Skittles, it's Henry! It's go time.

01:09:21.157 --> 01:09:23.398
I need your help now!

01:09:26.371 --> 01:09:28.362
Jj

01:09:40.343 --> 01:09:41.832
Sit.

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:03.280
Hey. Does anyone have
a stinging, searing pain

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:06.449
that is like lightning through your spine

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:08.993
and it's cooking your hind quarters?

01:10:10.248 --> 01:10:11.738
Yeah, me neither.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:13.164
Jj

01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:15.242
Hello?

01:10:15.336 --> 01:10:17.042
Hello? Can you hear me?

01:10:17.130 --> 01:10:21.043
Anyone? Hello? My name is xiao.

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:24.752
Three days ago, I hacked
into indium 6, and I'm very sorry.

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:29.385
I'm telling you this 'cause I think
my friend, Oliver Reed, is in trouble.

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:32.433
Mr. ram mills
is after Oliver's technology.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.135
I fear for Oliver's safety.

01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:38.269
I'm going to send you the coordinates
of a piece of Oliver's technology...

01:10:38.359 --> 01:10:39.974
A GPS dog collar.

01:10:40.069 --> 01:10:43.277
If you track the collar,
you'll find Mr. mills.

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:50.485
You think you know me? Huh?

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.533
You have no idea.

01:10:54.542 --> 01:10:56.157
I ook at me.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:59.995
I would do anything
to acquire this technology.

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:03.126
Anything.

01:11:05.887 --> 01:11:06.887
So now...

01:11:08.097 --> 01:11:09.507
Ttell me how you did it.

01:11:11.267 --> 01:11:13.474
Never running again. This is it.

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:15.267
After today, I walk everywhere.

01:11:16.355 --> 01:11:18.186
Come on, there's a rear entrance this way.

01:11:19.901 --> 01:11:21.266
Get up!

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.819
Henry!

01:11:33.915 --> 01:11:37.954
You think your stupid little animal
is gonna save you?

01:11:39.003 --> 01:11:40.288
Huh?

01:11:42.089 --> 01:11:45.377
Jj

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:56.747
Guys, guys, guys!
All right, all right!

01:11:56.771 --> 01:11:58.932
That's enough! That's enough!

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:00.388
Dude's trapped.

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:01.814
He can't escape, and he knows ft.

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:03.732
Great work, everybody.

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:06.983
Now just hold him there
while I go talk to Ollie.

01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:09.689
Ollie, go to the dance.

01:12:09.784 --> 01:12:11.194
Ted and I will handle this fool.

01:12:11.285 --> 01:12:13.492
- You're not gonna...
- Kill him? No.

01:12:13.579 --> 01:12:16.366
Maybe 15,000 years ago,
when we were wolves.

01:12:16.457 --> 01:12:20.075
But we're domesticated now.
We're gonna humiliate him.

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:22.125
- You cool with that?
- Actually, yes.

01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:24.295
Cool. Stick to the plan.

01:12:24.382 --> 01:12:26.247
Sophie, parents, song.

01:12:26.342 --> 01:12:28.549
- You got this.
- Okay.

01:12:28.636 --> 01:12:29.796
- Thanks, Henry.
- Go.

01:12:29.887 --> 01:12:32.219
I'll be there in 20 minutes!

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:36.261
For only two legs, that kid is fast!

01:12:36.352 --> 01:12:38.343
Jj

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:56.528
Jj

01:13:11.262 --> 01:13:13.253
Jj

01:13:27.278 --> 01:13:28.278
What are you looking at?

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:33.151
Look away!

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:35.984
Where are you, you disgusting animal?

01:13:37.246 --> 01:13:39.737
Don't you dare think of it.
Don't you dare!

01:13:43.210 --> 01:13:45.542
Take a whiff of that, fart face!

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:47.624
Jj

01:13:59.977 --> 01:14:01.808
Ollie!

01:14:01.896 --> 01:14:03.227
Sophie!

01:14:03.314 --> 01:14:07.102
- You came! Are you okay?
- I think so.

01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:10.026
I just got kidnapped by Mr. mills.
He was choking me,

01:14:10.112 --> 01:14:12.979
and Ted, Henry
and a bunch of other dogs came in

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:15.281
and they rescued me.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:23.619
Oliver, you are so funny. I love it.

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.040
I'm not joking.

01:14:25.127 --> 01:14:27.994
Jj

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:30.171
Callen, munoz.

01:14:30.257 --> 01:14:32.748
We've had direct satellite video
contact with the hacker.

01:14:32.843 --> 01:14:34.834
We're trusting him as an ally.

01:14:34.929 --> 01:14:36.669
Sending you the coordinates of mills.

01:14:36.764 --> 01:14:39.972
He's heading to the school,
maybe to get Oliver or the dog.

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:42.095
Bring in him and the boy immediately.

01:14:44.438 --> 01:14:47.396
Remember, belle, the plan is
for us to find Ollie and Sophie

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:50.520
and then...
Go on the lookout for the parents.

01:14:55.616 --> 01:14:56.885
I don't get it.
You told this joke already.

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:59.400
It's not a joke. Mr. mills...

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:02.077
- Is a bad, bad man...
- Ollie. Ollie.

01:15:02.164 --> 01:15:03.475
You should've seen Ted.
He was awesome.

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.740
- Henry!
- First he sat on Mr. mills,

01:15:05.835 --> 01:15:07.104
- and then...
- You lost your collar!

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:09.961
Wait, what? You can't hear me?
Oh, let's deal with that later.

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:11.628
We're gonna go watch for mom and dad.

01:15:11.716 --> 01:15:14.207
Enough with the talking dogs.
Let's dance.

01:15:14.301 --> 01:15:16.417
Okay.

01:15:16.512 --> 01:15:19.003
Jj

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:37.313
Hey, Ollie.

01:15:37.408 --> 01:15:39.899
Oh, you must be Sophie.

01:15:39.994 --> 01:15:42.451
I have heard so much about you.

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:43.823
Mom!

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:45.745
It's okay, Oliver. We all have parents.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:48.540
Mom's here. Excellent.
Now all we need is dad.

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:51.585
Ollie, this dance is amazing!

01:15:51.672 --> 01:15:53.162
Are you sure you wanna go home?

01:15:53.257 --> 01:15:56.124
Any moment now, dad's gonna make
his grand entrance,

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:57.549
his hero moment,

01:15:57.636 --> 01:16:00.503
his iron man drop-in-from-the-sky,
flying-into-battle,

01:16:00.598 --> 01:16:03.180
ready to beat up the bad guys!

01:16:06.979 --> 01:16:08.685
Or not.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:11.856
Jeez, it's tinsel, Lukas, not barbed wire.

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:15.355
Come with me.

01:16:15.446 --> 01:16:17.437
Jj

01:16:28.501 --> 01:16:30.162
Now!

01:16:52.566 --> 01:16:55.729
It's out of our paws now, my friend.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.254
Will you dance with me?

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:37.482
Is that the look?

01:17:40.030 --> 01:17:42.942
Bingo! It is. We did it, Ollie.

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:59.164
Jj

01:18:20.321 --> 01:18:22.687
Hey. Remember this?

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:25.346
They played this song at our wedding.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:30.240
Oh, you mean our first dance
as husband and wife?

01:18:30.331 --> 01:18:32.822
Nah, I don't remember.

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:36.751
- It wasn't important.
- Oh, stop it. Come here.

01:18:40.716 --> 01:18:44.800
Hey. Is everything okay?

01:18:44.887 --> 01:18:46.548
Everything's great.

01:18:46.639 --> 01:18:47.719
Belle, listen.

01:18:47.806 --> 01:18:50.422
I am sorry about the parking ticket
comment the other day.

01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:52.223
I sounded like a real dog.

01:18:52.311 --> 01:18:54.597
I mean, not a real...
You know what I mean.

01:18:54.688 --> 01:18:57.304
- Do you wanna dance?
- Sure.

01:19:12.373 --> 01:19:13.453
Remember, belle.

01:19:13.540 --> 01:19:17.579
If anyone gives us a hard time,
we're emotional support animals.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:21.003
Just quickly find an insecure kid
and stand next to them.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:22.671
Which is basically any kid.

01:19:41.402 --> 01:19:45.236
So, thought reader,
what am I thinking now?

01:19:57.876 --> 01:19:59.707
You're getting warmer.

01:20:36.832 --> 01:20:38.322
What are you doing?

01:20:38.417 --> 01:20:39.782
Belle, get Ollie!

01:20:39.877 --> 01:20:41.663
Henry! Henry!

01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:44.916
Henry!

01:20:45.007 --> 01:20:47.749
I got this fool.

01:20:49.970 --> 01:20:52.177
- You just cold-cocked Mr. mills.
- I did!

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:55.256
I totally nailed that dude!

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:57.683
- We cool?
- Super cool.

01:20:57.770 --> 01:20:59.726
You've got nothing on me! Nothing!

01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:02.292
Well, there's something
innocent people yell all the time.

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:06.275
Wait, wait, wait.
I'm Bridget Montgomery.

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:08.148
I work for Mr. mills.

01:21:08.238 --> 01:21:10.149
I can vouch for this man.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.356
And I can assure you,

01:21:12.451 --> 01:21:15.568
you will have plenty on him.

01:21:18.874 --> 01:21:22.287
Oh, simple, simple mills.

01:21:22.378 --> 01:21:25.336
If only you could think like a genius.

01:21:32.054 --> 01:21:33.919
- Bye-bye.
- What's going on here?

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:35.325
- He kidnapped me. It was Mr. mills.
- Ollie, what...?

01:21:35.349 --> 01:21:39.012
I'm afraid your son's suspected
of cyber-trespassing, cyber intrusion,

01:21:39.103 --> 01:21:42.095
and unauthorized access of an
international communication satellite.

01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:43.189
Uh, what? What is that?

01:21:43.273 --> 01:21:45.233
- What does that mean?
- You need to come with us.

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:49.731
- Okay.
- Ollie!

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:52.655
Can I play Romeo until you get back
from the big house?

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:56.158
So, Ollie never went
fo any big house.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:57.655
He went to his own house.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.282
A comfortably-sized house,

01:21:59.373 --> 01:22:01.364
where he was sentenced for home detention,

01:22:03.168 --> 01:22:06.251
except you stay in your own home
as your punishment.

01:22:06.338 --> 01:22:07.794
How cool is that?

01:22:07.881 --> 01:22:10.042
It's where you serve your time
for your crime.

01:22:11.176 --> 01:22:13.292
It's also where you serve pancakes.

01:22:13.387 --> 01:22:15.628
Just a second, Henry.

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:16.928
Pancakes are almost done.

01:22:17.933 --> 01:22:22.267
Needless to say, dad turned down
the Springfield university job.

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:26.688
Still drinks his green juice
and he's added biking to his regimen.

01:22:26.775 --> 01:22:29.266
Doesn't do any cool jumps
or spins or anything.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:33.195
But, you know, in dog years,
the guy is 280.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:35.819
Bet his hair's gonna look great
when he takes off his helmet.

01:22:35.909 --> 01:22:39.072
Yup. Look at that beautiful
280-year-old hair.

01:22:39.163 --> 01:22:41.199
- What's in that green juice?
- Mom!

01:22:41.290 --> 01:22:43.622
- Dad's back! Food's ready.
- Wow, look at this spread.

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:45.620
- Hey, babe.
- Hey, how's the painting going?

01:22:45.711 --> 01:22:48.544
- It's good.
- It's going great. She's killing it.

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:50.291
Apparently, I'm killing it.

01:22:50.382 --> 01:22:51.872
Like you do.

01:22:57.389 --> 01:23:01.132
I've only played games on my switch.
I haven't done anything.

01:23:01.226 --> 01:23:02.466
Actually, you have.

01:23:04.188 --> 01:23:06.725
Your telepathic technology
is so sophisticated...

01:23:06.815 --> 01:23:09.227
We're willing to waive
your cyber-trespassing charges

01:23:09.318 --> 01:23:10.837
in exchange for your services this summer.

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:11.896
Seriously?

01:23:11.987 --> 01:23:13.648
We're part of a global initiative

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:16.981
to improve the lives of all humans
through technological innovation.

01:23:17.075 --> 01:23:19.691
With the help of great minds
like Oliver's.

01:23:21.788 --> 01:23:23.494
And Henry's.

01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:28.367
Jj

01:23:31.632 --> 01:23:33.839
Do you understand me?

01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:38.590
- I do.
- Do you... understand me?

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:43.800
I understand you had a chili dog
and some curly fries for lunch.

01:23:44.895 --> 01:23:46.977
- Hey, Callen?
- Oh, yeah.

01:23:47.064 --> 01:23:48.520
- Callen? Heh.
- Sorry.

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:51.268
May I?

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.360
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good.

01:23:54.279 --> 01:23:56.691
- Now we're talking. Thank heavens.
- Henry, you're back!

01:23:56.782 --> 01:23:58.760
- That whole barking thing is a joke.
- He's talking?

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:00.803
He's talking to the dog.
Are you talking to the dog?

01:24:00.827 --> 01:24:03.264
- Can you understand it?
- Yes! I told you, I can hear him.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:05.779
Oh, my god, he's talking to the dog.

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:08.160
Look at how happy dad is.
How cool is this, right?

01:24:08.252 --> 01:24:11.494
Once you've completed basic training
at an undisclosed location...

01:24:11.588 --> 01:24:13.124
Hawaii!

01:24:13.215 --> 01:24:14.651
- I'm sorry. Come on, it's Hawaii.
- It's fine.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.415
Hawaii? Wait, which island?

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:20.298
You will be awarded with a scholarship
at a university of your choice.

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:21.389
Pick a party school.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:22.963
What about my parents?
Can they come?

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:25.674
Of course. Everything's been arranged.

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:31.688
- Mom? Dad”? Can we go?
- Can we go?

01:24:32.776 --> 01:24:33.811
No. No.

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:35.935
What?

01:24:36.029 --> 01:24:38.896
Yeah! Are you kidding me? Hawaii?

01:24:38.991 --> 01:24:40.777
Yeah, you can go.

01:24:40.867 --> 01:24:41.982
Yeah. Whoa.

01:24:42.077 --> 01:24:45.194
Oh, no. Dad's dancing again.
Please make him stop.

01:24:45.289 --> 01:24:48.781
Oh, great, he's got a partner.
Make 'em both stop!

01:24:50.961 --> 01:24:53.327
Love, family and summer in Hawaii
with my best friend?

01:24:53.422 --> 01:24:54.582
What could be better?

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:57.756
Woo-hoo! Hawaii, here we come!

01:24:57.843 --> 01:25:00.926
See how good life can be
when you keep it simple?

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:03.254
I mean, look at this family.

01:25:03.348 --> 01:25:06.090
Mom and dad,
almost criminally attractive,

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:09.927
out of their rut and deeply in love.

01:25:10.022 --> 01:25:12.513
Oliver, safe, happy,

01:25:12.608 --> 01:25:15.771
and being recognized
as the budding scientific genius he is.

01:25:15.861 --> 01:25:18.193
Me? Still adorable,

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.396
and now headed for an island paradise

01:25:20.490 --> 01:25:23.903
to make the world a better place
with my best friend.

01:25:23.994 --> 01:25:25.404
It kinda makes you wonder

01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:28.202
how great could this incredible
planet of ours be

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:31.623
if everyone on it learned
to think like a dog.

01:27:09.725 --> 01:27:11.716
Jj
