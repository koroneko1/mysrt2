1
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,239
In this place,

2
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:10,199
there isn't just sand,

3
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,080
rocks,

4
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:14,080
or the sea.

5
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:16,840
For me,

6
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,680
a lot has happened here

7
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,719
and every time I come back,

8
00:02:26,199 --> 00:02:30,039
the sea breeze
brings back all those memories.

9
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,960
I can still remember that day.

10
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:41,319
It was the day that Mitr Chaibancha,

11
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:44,199
my most favorite actor,

12
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,800
passed away.

13
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,439
OCTOBER 8TH, 1970

14
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,759
Please don't shove each other.

15
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,479
The hall can't fit any more people.

16
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,800
Please stay in the front of the hall.

17
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,400
Don't push or shove.

18
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,759
Mr. Mitr Chaibancha is really dead.

19
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,240
In just a moment, we will show you
Mr. Mitr Chaibancha's body

20
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:06,000
through the hall's window.

21
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,520
Please don't push each other up the hall.

22
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,639
Hey!

23
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:00,719
Hey!

24
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,560
Are you okay now?

25
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,759
Where are you headed?

26
00:04:14,719 --> 00:04:15,919
To Chon Buri.

27
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:19,040
I'm heading there, too.

28
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,199
I'm taking these things
to my friend's house.

29
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,000
Can I go with you?

30
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,160
You came here
for Mitr Chaibancha's funeral, too?

31
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,160
How come those who play the villains

32
00:05:06,279 --> 00:05:08,079
aren't the ones to go first?

33
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,839
Why did it have to be the hero
Mitr Chaibancha?

34
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,399
It's not fair.

35
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,000
Whether they play a hero or a villain,

36
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,839
their lives matter equally
in real life, right?

37
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,519
How can a hero's life be viewed
as equal to that of a villain's?

38
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,399
But all lives have equal value.

39
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,319
No, they don't.

40
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,519
No matter what.

41
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,199
Of course, they do.

42
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,920
No, they don't.

43
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,480
They do.

44
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,759
They don't.

45
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,519
-They do.
-They don't.

46
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,319
-They do!
-They don't!

47
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,600
Stop, stop, stop.

48
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:11,439
Where exactly do you want me
to drop you off?

49
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,079
What is it?

50
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,240
Is this Dongtan Beach?

51
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,560
No.

52
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,759
I want to go to Dongtan.

53
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,199
Why do you want to go there?

54
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:46,879
I want to see where Mitr Chaibancha
fell from the helicopter.

55
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,720
Where is your house exactly?

56
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,680
Bobae Market.

57
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,439
I have to go abroad tomorrow.

58
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,560
Shit.

59
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,160
Hey!

60
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,319
Hey!

61
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,439
Hey!

62
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,040
Hey!

63
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,440
Here.

64
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,879
If you want to go to Dongtan Beach,
you'll have to go on your own.

65
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,440
But if you want to go home,
you can come with me.

66
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,279
Hey.

67
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,159
You want to see something beautiful?

68
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:36,360
Wow.

69
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,240
Just by turning the lights off
and on,

70
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,720
the world we see
can look completely different.

71
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,759
Turn it off again then.

72
00:11:42,559 --> 00:11:45,480
How can I drive without the lights?

73
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
Na!

74
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:01,840
Na!

75
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,519
Na!

76
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,759
Maybe I arrived too late.

77
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,320
Will it be a problem

78
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:26,240
if we have to find a place
to stay around here?

79
00:12:56,159 --> 00:13:01,159
SANMOOK HOTEL

80
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,320
Here we are.

81
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,840
What happened to your foot?

82
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,720
I cut myself on a rock.

83
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,480
Come.

84
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,000
Hello.

85
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,639
Can we have two rooms, please?

86
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,799
We only have one bungalow left.

87
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,600
We do have to stay here tonight.

88
00:14:36,159 --> 00:14:37,639
You understand, right?

89
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,360
Please give me the key then.

90
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:47,840
Sure.

91
00:14:50,039 --> 00:14:51,639
Please sign here.

92
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,039
What's your name?

93
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,960
MR. RAWEE

94
00:14:59,039 --> 00:15:00,399
I'm Rawee.

95
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,679
It means "the sun."

96
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,519
Your name is the opposite of mine.
I'm Saengchan.

97
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,720
Your name means "moonlight"?

98
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,480
That's a beautiful name.

99
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,639
Here's your key.

100
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,639
You go and shower first.

101
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,720
I'll wait outside.

102
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,160
Haven't you slept yet?

103
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:29,000
But where will you sleep?

104
00:18:29,559 --> 00:18:31,000
Don't worry about me.

105
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,559
It's just a few hours until dawn.

106
00:18:37,759 --> 00:18:40,559
And you really have to go abroad tomorrow?

107
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,720
Yes.

108
00:18:42,519 --> 00:18:44,079
What are you going to do there?

109
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,599
I'm going to study for my master's degree.

110
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,000
Wow.

111
00:18:50,079 --> 00:18:53,279
You must come from a rich family.

112
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:57,319
No, not at all.

113
00:18:58,319 --> 00:18:59,519
Actually,

114
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,359
my family are farmers.

115
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,440
What are you doing?

116
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,559
I'll clean your wound.

117
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,359
Who hit you?

118
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,319
My Aunt Shoob.

119
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,000
What about your parents?

120
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,799
I've never seen my father.

121
00:19:56,599 --> 00:19:58,000
As for my mother...

122
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:00,960
she promised

123
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:04,119
she'd bring me home.

124
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,880
My dad

125
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,440
left me at the temple...

126
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:16,720
and never came back.

127
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,599
How long ago was that?

128
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,599
Eleven years ago.

129
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,440
Mine has been ten years.

130
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,599
Thank you.

131
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:57,119
Have you ever read this book?

132
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,599
WAR OF LIFE
BY SRI BURAPHA

133
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,279
What's it about?

134
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,079
It's a love story of a poor couple.

135
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,559
"Home

136
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,039
has such a nice ring to it, Plern.

137
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,359
Sometimes I love home,

138
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:25,039
sometimes I can't stand it.

139
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,599
Actually, I wouldn't even have time
to be bored of home

140
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:31,519
even if every house in this world
were the same.

141
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,480
Young orphans

142
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,240
were sadly punished since birth.

143
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:45,079
I pray for those kids every single night.

144
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,279
I even pray for the King's children.

145
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,880
I still pray without fail."

146
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,480
"Please consider me your friend,

147
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,519
to share your grief and happiness forever.

148
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,279
I won't leave you,

149
00:22:19,359 --> 00:22:21,599
just like the sun doesn't leave the Earth,

150
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,359
and I won't forget you,

151
00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,359
just like you don't forget to breathe."

152
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,279
"I won't leave you,

153
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:34,599
just like the sun
doesn't leave the Earth."

154
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:39,599
I want to be like Plern.

155
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,839
Here, finish reading it.

156
00:22:47,519 --> 00:22:48,440
Then tell me

157
00:22:48,519 --> 00:22:50,480
if you still want to be like Plern.

158
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:55,160
But you're leaving tomorrow.

159
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:57,240
How can I tell you?

160
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,240
Then tell me in two years.

161
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,039
And where would I find you?

162
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,000
Here.

163
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,680
On the 8th of October, then.

164
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:21,440
Okay.

165
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,000
On the 8th of October.

166
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,400
Promise?

167
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:34,960
Promise.

168
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:06,079
Have you seen Rawee?

169
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:08,599
The one who came with you last night?

170
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,799
Yes.

171
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,559
He left at dawn.

172
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,960
What's wrong?

173
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,279
What happened to you?

174
00:26:48,079 --> 00:26:51,279
My Aunt Shoob burnt me
with a cigarette.

175
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,359
What a cruel woman!

176
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,200
Stop sobbing now.

177
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,759
No one will abuse you here.

178
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,680
But if you don't do a good job,
you'll get fired.

179
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,799
Supaphorn?

180
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,440
Can you...

181
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:10,119
Can you read this for me?

182
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,000
"You were asleep,

183
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:16,279
so I didn't want to wake you.

184
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:19,599
I'll drop my luggage at Mana's home first.

185
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,960
When I'm done,

186
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,319
I'll return to take you back to Bangkok.

187
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,119
Wait for me.

188
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,119
Love,

189
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,680
Rawee."

190
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,359
Rawee didn't leave me.

191
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,599
Who is Rawee?

192
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,960
Rawee...

193
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:42,480
He's studying abroad.

194
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,079
He'll come back to see me in two years.

195
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:48,839
No wonder your Aunt Shoob kicked you out.

196
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,920
Supaphorn.

197
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,359
Can I go and study in the evening?

198
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,039
What?

199
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,400
I'd like to ask if I can go to school.

200
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,559
A-N-T, ant.

201
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,839
A-N-T, ant.

202
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,160
B-E-E, bee.

203
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,400
B-E-E, bee.

204
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,759
C-A-T, cat.

205
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:08,079
C-A-T, cat.

206
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,400
D-O-G, dog.

207
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,599
D-O-G, dog.

208
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:14,319
F-R...

209
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,200
I...

210
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,319
E...

211
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,400
N...

212
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,400
D.

213
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,759
Friend.

214
00:28:21,839 --> 00:28:23,039
"Friend."

215
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:28,920
It's pronounced "friend."

216
00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:31,319
Hello.

217
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,440
Excuse me. Sorry.

218
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:17,960
-Wait.
-What?

219
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,559
Your zipper broke.

220
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:28,160
Sorry.

221
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,680
Hello.

222
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,960
I have something for you.

223
00:29:59,319 --> 00:30:00,160
What is it?

224
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,519
Zippers.

225
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,039
Well, we sell these in my house.
We've got dozens.

226
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,119
Thank you.

227
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,920
We sew clothes at home as well.

228
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,799
So we have dozens of zippers, too.

229
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,359
And where do you live?

230
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,079
Around Saket Temple.

231
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,200
And you?

232
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,680
Oh, I'm at Sampheng.

233
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:22,680
Sampheng Chinese merchant.

234
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,480
So, why are you just studying now?

235
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:28,119
I've only been in Thailand for five years.

236
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,759
So where were you before that?

237
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,200
In China.

238
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,240
Where?

239
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,400
China.

240
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,759
China.

241
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:37,559
Oh, so you're an immigrant.

242
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,480
No.

243
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,680
I'm Thai, but of Chinese descent.

244
00:30:40,759 --> 00:30:42,119
My last name is Sae Lim.

245
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,839
How about this?

246
00:30:46,119 --> 00:30:48,839
I'll call you gege Lim.

247
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,119
No, that's not good.

248
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,839
Just call me Lim, it's more Thai.

249
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:00,920
We're here.

250
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:02,599
This is it.

251
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,079
Supaphorn's house.

252
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,359
My employer.

253
00:31:06,359 --> 00:31:08,799
I'll see you again tomorrow
then, Saengchan.

254
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,160
You can call me "Plern."

255
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,079
I'll change my name to Plern.

256
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,839
Plern is a nice name, too.

257
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:21,200
Well, then,
can I walk with you again tomorrow?

258
00:31:23,599 --> 00:31:25,079
Of course, Lim.

259
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,480
Thank you, Saengchan.

260
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,440
Plern!

261
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:28,960
Oh. Yes, Plern.

262
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,839
-Goodbye then.
-All right.

263
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,440
I...

264
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:56,119
Apostrophe...

265
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,119
D...

266
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,279
I'd.

267
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,440
L...

268
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:01,559
I...

269
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,680
K...

270
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:03,839
E...

271
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,559
Like.

272
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,279
"I'd like to be a writer,

273
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,440
so that I can use sweet and poetic words

274
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:12,400
to pursue Plern."

275
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,160
He...

276
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,640
has...

277
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,759
fish.

278
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:36,160
Thank you, Lim.

279
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,240
Of course.

280
00:32:53,599 --> 00:32:56,200
"She came and kissed me goodbye

281
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:57,960
for the last time.

282
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:00,519
It's time for us to die."

283
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:03,079
"The story in this last chapter

284
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:05,440
is so dark

285
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,440
that I can't see a thing."

286
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,400
"I have to say goodbye to you,

287
00:33:12,759 --> 00:33:14,240
my love."

288
00:33:15,839 --> 00:33:18,240
"Don't kill me in cold blood.

289
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:21,880
Kill me like I'm your lover

290
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,240
and let me die as your lover, my love."

291
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,880
This is the book I was talking about.

292
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,519
Lim, you should read it.

293
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:53,599
It's very good.

294
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,759
Thank you.

295
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,239
Oh, sorry.

296
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,920
It seems like you really love this book.

297
00:34:17,039 --> 00:34:18,039
Sorry.

298
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:19,320
That's okay.

299
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,679
Plern, would you like to have
your own clothing store?

300
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,519
Then you'll have to learn,
how to draw patterns.

301
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,440
I don't have time
to go to school for that.

302
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,280
You don't need a school.

303
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,280
Just learn from someone
who's good at it.

304
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,280
But who would I learn from?

305
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,559
I'll take you there later.

306
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,440
Thank you.

307
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,639
Hello, Mrs. Ratree.

308
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:33,119
I have a delivery for you.

309
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,960
Hello, Lim.

310
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,280
Hello, ma'am.

311
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:47,079
Is this the girl you were talking about?

312
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:48,960
Yes.

313
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,280
Did you stitch this outfit yourself?

314
00:36:06,679 --> 00:36:07,679
Yes.

315
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,639
Is everything there?

316
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:14,960
Yes.

317
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:17,559
And did you deliver
the school's order?

318
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:19,519
Yes, I did that yesterday.

319
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:23,920
When can you start?

320
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,639
You're going to hire me now?

321
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,440
Yes.

322
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:34,159
Tomorrow then.

323
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:34,559
MOM - DEVIL

324
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:37,320
DEVIL

325
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:46,119
"People vary and are different.

326
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:48,760
It's the reality, no doubt.

327
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:53,400
There are the lower class,
upper class, servants, owners,

328
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,599
bondmen, bosses.

329
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,079
But another thought,

330
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:01,519
a more modern one,

331
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:03,199
believes

332
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,039
that the difference between us

333
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,519
is just perception.

334
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,800
So,

335
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,360
it is something that can be changed."

336
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:14,880
-Hello, Lim.
-Hello, Jib.

337
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,920
Oh, Lim.

338
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,119
Who is this?

339
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,679
Rawee.

340
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:39,480
He's studying aboard right now.

341
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:41,639
He'll be back in a few months.

342
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,480
What kind of book is this?
It's not even fun to read.

343
00:38:45,519 --> 00:38:47,000
Why don't you like it?

344
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,679
I think it's very profound.

345
00:38:49,199 --> 00:38:50,599
You don't like it?

346
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,679
I didn't finish it.

347
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,960
It's a waste of time.

348
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,000
Sign here, please.

349
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,360
PLERN

350
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:15,480
Sign again.
Your name is Saengchan, not Plern.

351
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,920
What's the matter with you?

352
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:32,800
OCTOBER

353
00:39:49,159 --> 00:39:50,360
Three meters, please.

354
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:15,480
"You were asleep,

355
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,199
so I didn't want to wake you.

356
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,199
I'll drop my luggage at Mana's home first.

357
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:23,760
When I'm done,

358
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:26,440
I'll return to take you back to Bangkok.

359
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:27,920
Wait for me.

360
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,480
Love,

361
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,400
Rawee."

362
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:38,840
MISS PLERN WONG...

363
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:51,000
OCTOBER 8TH, 1972

364
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,480
Bungalow 11.

365
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,079
Thank you.

366
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,159
Rawee!

367
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,559
SANMOOK HOTEL

368
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
Plern.

369
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:01,719
Oh, Lim.

370
00:44:04,599 --> 00:44:06,079
Let me give you a ride.

371
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:08,880
Is that your car?

372
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,400
Yes, hop in.

373
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:14,039
I have something to show you.

374
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,480
What is it?

375
00:44:15,559 --> 00:44:17,239
I can't tell you right now.

376
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,719
You have to come with me.

377
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,880
Come on.

378
00:44:29,239 --> 00:44:30,719
Mind your head.

379
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,840
My father bought this house for me.

380
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,360
I'm going to be the owner of my own store.

381
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:50,360
So you'll be your own boss now.

382
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,519
Yes.

383
00:45:04,199 --> 00:45:05,280
Now,

384
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:07,000
I have a house

385
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:09,400
and my own store.

386
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,559
I...

387
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:16,159
I'm ready to start a family.

388
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:31,679
Bring back democracy!

389
00:45:37,159 --> 00:45:39,480
Bring back the constitution!

390
00:45:39,559 --> 00:45:42,039
We don't want to be ruled
by a dictator!

391
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:44,719
Marry me.

392
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,559
Will you marry me?

393
00:45:53,159 --> 00:45:54,239
I...

394
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,119
I don't think of you that way.

395
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,199
Hang on...

396
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:03,599
But I love you.

397
00:46:03,679 --> 00:46:04,800
Let go.

398
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:06,599
Lim, let go.

399
00:46:06,679 --> 00:46:08,159
I want to go home.

400
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,800
You're still waiting for Rawee,
aren't you?

401
00:46:18,559 --> 00:46:19,760
What are you talking about?

402
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:21,800
Last year,

403
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,920
you waited for him, but he didn't show up.

404
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:26,280
How do you know?

405
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,559
I...

406
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,800
I followed you.

407
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,199
Are you a detective now?

408
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,280
Following me around.

409
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:38,679
Whatever I do
and whoever I want to wait for

410
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,360
is my business.

411
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,840
That man has forgotten about you.

412
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:43,400
It's none of your business!

413
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,440
You read that novel too much.

414
00:46:48,519 --> 00:46:50,159
Plern isn't even your real name.

415
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:51,719
Your name is Saengchan.

416
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,559
Plern is the heroine's name in a novel.

417
00:46:54,639 --> 00:46:56,599
If I want to be called Plern

418
00:46:56,679 --> 00:46:58,280
or Saengchan,

419
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:00,360
that's up to me.

420
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,840
It has nothing to do with you!

421
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:20,679
COLLEGE STUDENTS ARRESTED

422
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,880
STUDENT DEMONSTRATORS FILL THE CITY
DEMANDING CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS

423
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,159
Excuse me.

424
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,840
I'll be off now.

425
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,599
Is Mrs. Samon's outfit ready?

426
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,400
Yes, it's done.

427
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,960
Okay, off you go.

428
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:44,679
Anything else?

429
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:47,760
Well,

430
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,280
I haven't received any pay.

431
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:52,840
How can you ask for money?

432
00:47:58,159 --> 00:47:59,960
I don't have anything on me.

433
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,800
I give you three meals a day,

434
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,960
provide you with shelter.

435
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,559
Is that not enough?

436
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,119
But...

437
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,360
I've worked for you
for two years already.

438
00:48:18,519 --> 00:48:20,679
So you're saying I owe you?

439
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:21,960
No.

440
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:23,679
It's just...

441
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:26,039
I think it's only fair...

442
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,159
And I've been unfair to you?

443
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:29,880
Tell me,

444
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,519
when have I been unfair to you?

445
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:36,360
If you were me,

446
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,559
and worked for no money,

447
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:40,199
you'd...

448
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,400
Don't ever compare yourself to me.

449
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:44,480
We were different from birth.

450
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:55,440
But doesn't every life have equal value?

451
00:48:58,119 --> 00:48:59,920
Do you know who you're talking to?

452
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,239
Get out of my house.

453
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:10,960
Get out!

454
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,039
OCTOBER 8TH, 1973

455
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,280
Why are you here?

456
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:17,039
I was at your employer's house.

457
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,480
I've never seen her so mad or angry.

458
00:50:23,719 --> 00:50:25,519
I just asked to be treated fairly.

459
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,960
So where are you
going to stay now?

460
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:33,679
How will you survive?

461
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,960
How can you wait for a man
who deceived you?

462
00:50:38,039 --> 00:50:39,239
Don't bother me!

463
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:06,559
You know...

464
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,400
when my dad

465
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,760
moved to Thailand from China...

466
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,679
he promised my mom

467
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,079
that once things are sorted,

468
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:26,400
he'll bring my mom here.

469
00:51:28,159 --> 00:51:29,360
Every single day,

470
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,360
she waited,

471
00:51:32,199 --> 00:51:34,079
waited for my dad to come back...

472
00:51:35,679 --> 00:51:37,480
but he never did.

473
00:51:39,199 --> 00:51:40,400
Because

474
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,559
once he came to Thailand,

475
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:45,079
he had a new wife.

476
00:51:48,039 --> 00:51:49,920
So why are you telling me this?

477
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:55,760
I think this man, Rawee...

478
00:51:57,679 --> 00:51:59,480
he's like my dad.

479
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:04,119
Rawee is a good,

480
00:52:04,199 --> 00:52:05,719
educated man,

481
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:09,280
not a loser roaming around
with a reed mat and pillow like your dad.

482
00:52:24,239 --> 00:52:26,280
You haven't eaten all day.

483
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,440
Eat something first.

484
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:33,480
Eat.

485
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,159
Why are you doing this?

486
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,360
Because I love you, Plern.

487
00:53:00,639 --> 00:53:02,239
Call me Saengchan.

488
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,280
You were right.

489
00:53:11,079 --> 00:53:12,679
My name is Saengchan.

490
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,199
Plern...

491
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:24,559
is just the heroine's name in a novel.

492
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,239
My name is Saengchan.

493
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:36,239
I'm Saengchan.

494
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,480
SAENGCHAN

495
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,320
That will be 63 baht.

496
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:53,280
-Thirty.
-Thank you.

497
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,239
Your outfit will be ready on the 7th.

498
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,159
Thank you.

499
00:54:11,239 --> 00:54:12,480
Thank you very much.

500
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:14,039
Thank you.

501
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,079
Are you hungry?

502
00:54:18,159 --> 00:54:19,519
That's a good idea.

503
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:21,079
It's still quiet.

504
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,119
Wait for a second. I'll heat up the soup.

505
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:44,079
OCTOBER 8TH, 1974

506
00:54:51,320 --> 00:54:56,119
MRS. SAENGCHAN

507
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:01,159
Here's the key.

508
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:02,440
Thank you.

509
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,519
Are you Saengchan?

510
00:55:07,159 --> 00:55:08,000
Yes.

511
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:09,960
There's a letter for you.

512
00:55:13,679 --> 00:55:15,280
It arrived a long time ago.

513
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,559
Thank you.

514
00:55:53,639 --> 00:55:54,840
Saengchan.

515
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,800
Why did you arrive only now?

516
00:55:59,639 --> 00:56:01,199
Where were you?

517
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,400
Why did you just get here?

518
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:03,400
Why did you just get here?

519
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,519
Why did you just get here?

520
00:56:04,599 --> 00:56:06,559
Why did you just get here?

521
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:09,119
Why?

522
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,840
In the year 1972, I was still in America,

523
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:45,639
but I sent Mana a letter for you.

524
00:56:50,159 --> 00:56:51,239
Excuse me.

525
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:54,119
Can you deliver this letter to Saengchan?

526
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:56,840
SAENGCHAN

527
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:04,639
Is this the letter?

528
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:13,840
And the following year,

529
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,039
where were you?

530
00:57:19,360 --> 00:57:20,840
I was in prison

531
00:57:22,159 --> 00:57:25,199
for persuading people to conspire
and protest against the government.

532
00:57:47,559 --> 00:57:48,679
And all this time,

533
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:51,199
how have you been?

534
00:57:56,679 --> 00:57:58,280
I went to school.

535
00:57:59,719 --> 00:58:02,119
Now I can read.

536
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,960
When we met,

537
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,400
you couldn't read?

538
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:28,159
It must be a monsoon

539
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:30,679
that passes through every year.

540
00:58:32,159 --> 00:58:33,960
It's a seasonal wind

541
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,360
that comes around as promised.

542
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:50,519
Why does it have to
bring back memories, too?

543
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,480
Who are you with now?

544
00:59:01,960 --> 00:59:03,760
Would it be okay if...

545
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:07,800
we don't talk about our personal lives?

546
00:59:18,360 --> 00:59:20,760
I just want to stop the world for a day.

547
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:27,039
Then let's not allow the rain
to trap us in this room.

548
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,400
Right?

549
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:20,239
"The weather is so clear this morning.

550
01:02:20,719 --> 01:02:23,119
I don't want to leave,

551
01:02:24,239 --> 01:02:26,039
but I have to go back to reality.

552
01:02:27,119 --> 01:02:29,599
I can't just turn off the lights

553
01:02:30,119 --> 01:02:31,639
and lie to myself

554
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:35,599
that the lights we see
on the fireflies are stars."

555
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,760
"I asked myself all the time

556
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:43,440
why you weren't there
waiting for me that morning."

557
01:02:45,760 --> 01:02:47,719
"It might sound cruel

558
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:50,280
to compare our relationship

559
01:02:50,719 --> 01:02:51,880
with just a dream

560
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:55,079
that goes away when we wake up."

561
01:02:57,840 --> 01:03:00,159
"If you receive this letter,

562
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,440
it means

563
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:04,679
you have come back to Sanmook Hotel

564
01:03:05,519 --> 01:03:07,239
as we'd promised."

565
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,119
"I still haven't answered you,

566
01:03:12,199 --> 01:03:14,280
if I still want to be Plern.

567
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:16,760
Honestly,

568
01:03:17,159 --> 01:03:18,960
I now understand Plern better.

569
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:23,960
I understand why she had to marry
the man she didn't love.

570
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:27,480
I understand her sorrows

571
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:30,559
of being apart from the person
she really loves.

572
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,039
I don't want to be like Plern,

573
01:03:35,360 --> 01:03:37,559
but I've already become Plern."

574
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,719
"If anything changes again,

575
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,880
I hope that you will keep this date,

576
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,400
time,

577
01:03:47,480 --> 01:03:49,280
and this place

578
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:51,960
as our rendezvous."

579
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:14,400
BANGKOK - CHON BURI

580
01:05:07,400 --> 01:05:09,400
I went to Sanmook bungalow.

581
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:24,159
I was about to come and pick you up,

582
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:28,039
but couldn't get there,

583
01:05:31,280 --> 01:05:32,880
because the road was closed off.

584
01:06:28,840 --> 01:06:30,480
Aren't you going to ask

585
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,039
where I've been?

586
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,280
You're very drunk.

587
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,679
Go to sleep now.

588
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,559
I went to a gentleman's club.

589
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,280
I was wenching.

590
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:51,639
Go and take a shower.

591
01:06:51,719 --> 01:06:52,719
No.

592
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:58,159
If not, then go to sleep.

593
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:01,679
Let's go. I'll take you.

594
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:04,320
Go to sleep.

595
01:07:07,320 --> 01:07:08,519
Be careful.

596
01:07:44,719 --> 01:07:48,440
OCTOBER 8TH, 1975

597
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:08,800
I'M WAITING FOR YOU HERE.

598
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,000
Rawee!

599
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:09,199
Rawee!

600
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:16,079
My friends and I built this place

601
01:09:16,439 --> 01:09:18,039
so that the kids can read.

602
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:25,520
You're so generous and kind.

603
01:09:28,600 --> 01:09:31,000
I've received help
from others before.

604
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,600
Now I'm ready to help those in need,

605
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:38,439
even though
a professor's salary isn't much.

606
01:09:40,000 --> 01:09:43,119
All your students are very lucky.

607
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,720
I have something for you.

608
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:02,439
What is it?

609
01:10:05,640 --> 01:10:07,359
My first typewriter.

610
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:08,960
Is it for me?

611
01:10:09,319 --> 01:10:10,239
Yes.

612
01:10:14,119 --> 01:10:15,680
It's something I love.

613
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:17,640
I want you to keep it.

614
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:22,640
But I'm not a writer.

615
01:10:23,159 --> 01:10:24,640
It won't be of much use to me.

616
01:10:25,119 --> 01:10:26,319
Just try it

617
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,000
and then tell me if you can be a writer.

618
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:35,000
In that case,

619
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:37,920
this student will submit something
to you next year,

620
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,000
Professor.

621
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,159
Promise?

622
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,079
Promise.

623
01:11:15,039 --> 01:11:16,119
Thank you.

624
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,520
Young man,
your girlfriend is very beautiful.

625
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,039
When I was a young man,
my girlfriend was beautiful, too.

626
01:11:24,359 --> 01:11:25,359
Bullshit.

627
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:27,840
No, I'm not.
I'm still sexually active.

628
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:52,880
AT NIGHT

629
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:27,560
THAT WAS WONDERFUL

630
01:16:39,119 --> 01:16:40,600
Here's your key.

631
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:44,000
-Your room is upstairs.
-Okay.

632
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:23,920
Due to the current situation,
the groups involved 

633
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,840
consist of college students
and the general public

634
01:17:26,920 --> 01:17:28,880
who have assisted in communist terrorism,

635
01:17:29,239 --> 01:17:31,279
causing trouble in the city.

636
01:17:31,359 --> 01:17:33,079
In order to end this
and bring back peace,

637
01:17:33,159 --> 01:17:35,079
the democratic reform committee

638
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:37,560
has taken over the government

01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:40,119
from 6:00 p.m.

640
01:17:40,199 --> 01:17:43,680

-Why are you burning them?
-They're books of communists.

647
01:18:34,119 --> 01:18:35,359
They are not.

648
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,880
The people who built this place
are communists.

649
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,079
These are books of communists!

650
01:18:39,479 --> 01:18:40,479
Move!

651
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,279
They're all children's books.

Can you leave it in the room, please?

Lim.

664
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:13,920
That man doesn't love you, Saengchan.

665
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:21,079
Come back to me.

666
01:24:25,119 --> 01:24:27,239
How long have you been
waiting for him?

667
01:24:28,439 --> 01:24:29,720
Do you ever see him?

668
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,199
How long are you going to wait
for a man who doesn't even exist?

669
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:35,680
How many days,

670
01:24:36,279 --> 01:24:37,760
months, and years?

671
01:24:40,319 --> 01:24:41,720
This man...

672
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,239
exists.

673
01:24:45,319 --> 01:24:46,520
I have feelings

674
01:24:48,159 --> 01:24:50,159
and I love you everyday,

675
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:51,520
every month,

676
01:24:51,600 --> 01:24:52,680
every year,

677
01:24:53,039 --> 01:24:54,840
and every single minute.

678
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:59,119
Lim, don't love someone like me.

679
01:24:59,560 --> 01:25:00,760
But I love you, Saengchan.

680
01:25:00,880 --> 01:25:01,960
Let go.

681
01:25:02,720 --> 01:25:03,720
Lim, let go!

682
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,600
We all make mistakes.

683
01:25:06,039 --> 01:25:07,640
I'm not mad at you.

684
01:25:08,439 --> 01:25:10,039
Can we start again?

685
01:25:11,079 --> 01:25:13,079
So we can be part of the same family

686
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,319
with a dad,

687
01:25:14,399 --> 01:25:15,359
a mom,

688
01:25:15,479 --> 01:25:16,560
and children.

689
01:25:18,159 --> 01:25:20,399
Our children will call me "Papa"

690
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:23,279
and you "Mama."

691
01:25:26,439 --> 01:25:27,520
Lim...

692
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:30,760
You're a good man.

693
01:25:33,119 --> 01:25:34,720
I don't deserve you.

694
01:25:40,399 --> 01:25:42,199
If I'm such a good man...

695
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:46,039
why do you have to leave me?

696
01:25:47,319 --> 01:25:49,119
I don't want to be good anymore.

697
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,279
Lim. Enough.

698
01:25:52,359 --> 01:25:54,359
I don't want to be
a good person anymore.

699
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:56,640
I don't want to be a good person.

700
01:25:57,840 --> 01:25:59,840
Lim. Let go!

701
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,279
Don't!

702
01:26:01,359 --> 01:26:02,359
Don't!

703
01:26:02,439 --> 01:26:03,279
Let go of me.

704
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:04,359
Lim!

705
01:26:04,960 --> 01:26:06,039
Let go!

706
01:26:06,640 --> 01:26:07,840
Lim!

707
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:23,199

712
01:28:20,600 --> 01:28:25,000
SAENGCHAN

713
01:28:52,039 --> 01:28:53,520
You're shutting down the business?

714
01:28:56,159 --> 01:28:57,680
There's a lot to deal with at the factory.

715
01:28:57,760 --> 01:28:59,640
Not enough time for this store.

716
01:29:00,560 --> 01:29:02,159
-Lim.
-Yeah?

717
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:34,079
Let's go.

718
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,199
FOR SALE
TEL 221915

719
01:29:58,359 --> 01:29:59,439
Excuse me.

720
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:03,319
The owner of this shop, Saengchan,
where did she go?

721
01:30:03,680 --> 01:30:07,119
She packed up all her things
and went after a man a long time ago.

722
01:30:08,840 --> 01:30:11,239
And do you know
where she could be now?

723
01:30:11,600 --> 01:30:12,800
Who knows?

724
01:30:13,359 --> 01:30:15,159
Even her husband doesn't know.

725
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,199
This typewriter,

726
01:31:00,279 --> 01:31:02,479
the new owner of the land
let you borrow it.

727
01:31:09,840 --> 01:31:10,920
Who is he?

728
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:13,800
Mr. Somchai.

729
01:31:13,880 --> 01:31:14,880
He's from Bangkok.

730
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:18,039
He bought this land
from the previous owner

731
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:19,920
and asked me to take care of it.

732
01:31:26,279 --> 01:31:27,399
When he comes back,

733
01:31:27,479 --> 01:31:28,760
can you let me know?

734
01:31:29,359 --> 01:31:30,760
I want to thank him

735
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:33,640
for letting me stay here.

736
01:31:34,760 --> 01:31:35,840
Okay.

737
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:37,560
Make yourself at home.

738
01:31:38,199 --> 01:31:39,680
I'll come back tomorrow.

739
01:31:40,399 --> 01:31:41,479
Thank you.

740
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:32,000
Rawee, you don't look too good.

741
01:32:32,239 --> 01:32:33,840
Maybe you should see a doctor.

742
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,039
I'm okay.

743
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:43,560
Did Saengchan write this?

744
01:32:50,319 --> 01:32:51,720
I saw Saengchan

745
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:56,000
typing all day and all night.

746
01:33:00,119 --> 01:33:01,520
If I may ask,

747
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:03,920
where were you during that time?

748
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,520
I had to hide in the jungle

749
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,880
because I was accused
of being a communist.

750
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:14,880
But now,

751
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,439
everything has calmed down
and is back to normal.

752
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:22,960
So, Saengchan...

753
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:27,239
comes here every year, right?

754
01:33:28,159 --> 01:33:29,239
Yes.

755
01:33:31,159 --> 01:33:32,880
On every 8th of October,

756
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:36,000
she kept coming
until the bungalow shut down.

757
01:33:43,159 --> 01:33:44,359
Even after that,

758
01:33:45,479 --> 01:33:46,880
she still came.

759
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:07,640
"He's like the sun,

760
01:35:08,199 --> 01:35:10,600
the light piercing through my heart.

761
01:35:11,520 --> 01:35:12,720
I...

762
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,279
I'm like the moon

763
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:18,119
shining soft dreamy light
throughout the night.

764
01:35:19,119 --> 01:35:20,520
Every morning,

765
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:23,199
I'm at the edge of the Earth

766
01:35:23,800 --> 01:35:28,199
glancing at him, shining on everyone."

OCTOBER 8TH, 1981

768
01:36:59,640 --> 01:37:04,039
THREE YEARS LATER

769
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:24,359
Hello.

770
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:25,640
Come on in.

771
01:37:26,359 --> 01:37:28,199
Would you like anything?
Coffee or

772
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,279
-water?
-No. Thank you

773
01:37:31,119 --> 01:37:33,640
What did you want to talk to me about?

774
01:37:35,439 --> 01:37:37,760
This latest work of yours

775
01:37:38,319 --> 01:37:41,359
is different from the earlier ones.

776
01:37:41,680 --> 01:37:44,680
You've been close to people
in the labor industry

777
01:37:45,159 --> 01:37:48,880
and all of a sudden, what inspired you
to write a romantic piece like this?

778
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:51,279
If...

779
01:37:51,359 --> 01:37:53,479
you don't see it suitable to print,

780
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:54,640
that's okay.

781
01:37:55,039 --> 01:37:56,439
It's not that.

782
01:37:57,000 --> 01:37:59,000
I didn't say I wouldn't print it.

783
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:00,600
So...

784
01:38:01,199 --> 01:38:03,000
why did you call me here?

785
01:38:03,439 --> 01:38:05,760
Well, your story...
I'd like you to see this one.

786
01:38:07,359 --> 01:38:08,319
It's like

787
01:38:08,399 --> 01:38:10,600
it's been written by the same person.

788
01:38:14,720 --> 01:38:16,479
...BECAUSE I LOVE HIM.

789
01:38:16,560 --> 01:38:19,600
HIS NAME IS RAWEE, WHICH MEANS THE SUN

790
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,600
Where did you get this manuscript from?

791
01:38:22,680 --> 01:38:24,159
Someone sent it to me to get printed.

792
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:25,199
What's the person's name?

793
01:38:25,279 --> 01:38:26,479
I don't know.

794
01:38:27,039 --> 01:38:30,640
But when he knew it was similar to yours,

795
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:33,279
he was very happy,

796
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,880
and he asked me to tell you

797
01:38:36,520 --> 01:38:38,359
that he'll meet you

798
01:38:38,439 --> 01:38:40,920
on the 8th of October.

799
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:52,640
OCTOBER 8TH, 1984

800
01:39:19,840 --> 01:39:21,960
You didn't expect
to see me here, right?

801
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:28,399
You're the one who gave
the manuscript to the publisher?

802
01:39:30,319 --> 01:39:31,319
Yes.

803
01:39:35,319 --> 01:39:36,800
But where did you get it?

804
01:39:48,680 --> 01:39:50,520
So, you're Rawee?

805
01:39:55,479 --> 01:39:58,079
And you're Somchai?

806
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,279
The one who bought this bungalow.

807
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:07,319
You don't look too well.

808
01:40:08,159 --> 01:40:10,159
Did you see a doctor?

809
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:12,720
I...

810
01:40:13,039 --> 01:40:14,520
I'm not going anywhere.

811
01:40:15,560 --> 01:40:17,039
I just want to stay here.

812
01:40:18,399 --> 01:40:19,600
Let me stay here.

813
01:40:28,840 --> 01:40:30,640
Today is the 8th of October.

814
01:40:36,760 --> 01:40:38,560
Saengchan will be back.

815
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,000
Saengchan will be back.

816
01:40:47,239 --> 01:40:48,720
Saengchan will be back.

817
01:41:05,359 --> 01:41:06,840
Saengchan will be back.

818
01:41:22,479 --> 01:41:23,960
He's gone...

819
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:28,920
because the malaria
had progressed to his brain.

820
01:42:07,520 --> 01:42:08,720
Saengchan.

821
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,920
Rawee.

822
01:43:30,520 --> 01:43:31,800
Today

823
01:43:32,159 --> 01:43:34,279
is the 8th of October,

824
01:43:35,359 --> 01:43:38,439
the same day Rawee left this world.

825
01:43:40,399 --> 01:43:44,199
Even though we had
only a short time together,

826
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:48,560
he changed my life...

827
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:51,159
My entire life.
