1
00:00:31,542 --> 00:00:32,957
Hold it! Don't let it go!

2
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:37,832
Hold it!

3
00:00:44,417 --> 00:00:46,625
Read! I know you can read this.

4
00:00:46,792 --> 00:00:47,792
Read!

5
00:00:48,332 --> 00:00:50,707
Calm down, honey!

6
00:00:51,125 --> 00:00:54,000
-It will be over in a minute.
-Mommy.

7
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:02,917
Honey!

8
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:04,542
Police!

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,457
Open the door! Right now!

10
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:09,542
Just read the writing!

11
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:12,792
It must open up now.

12
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:14,832
Read!

13
00:01:19,832 --> 00:01:21,792
The writing will appear, right?

14
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:23,417
Start reading!

15
00:01:38,207 --> 00:01:39,500
Read!

16
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:45,000
Quick!

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,375
Those who reside...

18
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,542
in the mystical world.

19
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:27,875
-Daddy!
-Keep reading! Go on!

20
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:30,000
-Daddy, quick!
-Read.

21
00:02:31,582 --> 00:02:34,207
Welcome us...

22
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:44,667
Don't you dare say those words!

23
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,375
Read! Read!

24
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:10,332
Mommy!

25
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:12,000
Police! Get down!

26
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:18,750
It's over!

27
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,082
Linda.

28
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,500
Don't get so tired, okay?

29
00:03:56,167 --> 00:03:57,917
What time
did you finish your work last night?

30
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,332
As usual, Miss, at 9:00 p.m.

31
00:04:04,207 --> 00:04:05,457
That's my shift.

32
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:12,042
Next semester, if you don't get a better
mark, I'll report this to Mr. Danang.

33
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,125
-Here, Sir.
-You will work over time today.

34
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,791
Siska isn't working today.

35
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:54,000
Turn off your cellphone.

36
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,375
Don't play with your cellphone at work.

37
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:59,583
You use your cellphone all the time!

38
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,291
Who is this?

39
00:05:02,208 --> 00:05:03,083
Yeah?

40
00:05:04,416 --> 00:05:05,416
I will work late.

41
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,333
Don't get too tired, Dad.

42
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,041
Remember to take the medicine.

43
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:11,666
Okay.

44
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:13,666
Bye.

45
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:24,208
Linda.

46
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:25,958
Say hi.

47
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:27,833
What are you doing anyway?

48
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,125
Doing a live stream.

49
00:05:31,208 --> 00:05:32,583
That's it. It's so cool.

50
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:36,458
I've told you your face could be popular.

51
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
Oh, shit!

52
00:05:39,541 --> 00:05:41,458
Damn! I can't accept this.

53
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:42,833
Look!

54
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:47,708
Ira, in class 11, our junior,
she has more followers than me.

55
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,416
I have told you, Jess.

56
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:53,416
Will you lose to the junior students?

57
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,583
We should be cooler, right?

58
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,083
You have told me that
more than a month ago.

59
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:00,625
-Doing a video in that building, right?
-That's right.

60
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:04,583
So, we'll do a live stream there,
and we'll do it together.

61
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,666
And we'll just do selfies.
Can you imagine that?

62
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,291
You will get many endorsers.

63
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:12,458
It's all good money!

64
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,291
It is not that easy.

65
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,958
Lucky you,
you don't have to work like this.

66
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,666
What have I told you?
You don't want me to help you.

67
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,458
You don't want me
to lend you money either.

68
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:27,125
I would not feel easy about that.

69
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,125
Excuse me, this was dropped over there.

70
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,125
Thank you, Senior.

71
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:42,000
You are Linda, right? You are in class 11?

72
00:06:42,833 --> 00:06:43,833
Hey!

73
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,625
-You are Senior Erik, right?
-Just Erik.

74
00:06:48,833 --> 00:06:50,375
How long have you been working here?

75
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:53,916
-A month.
-A month.

76
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,333
Why, Senior? Erik?

77
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,625
This drink usually is put here, not there.

78
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:07,125
Oh, I am so sorry.

79
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,416
I am really sorry.

80
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,041
Just relax.

81
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:13,458
I am really sorry,
I didn't do that on purpose.

82
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:16,083
I shouldn't disturb you
when you're working.

83
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,666
All right, I will pay for this.

84
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:20,541
Senior?

85
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,625
It's okay. I don't want the manager
to get angry with you.

86
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:26,083
-But...
-And don't call me "Senior."

87
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:29,041
-But that was not your...
-Just relax.

88
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,000
What the hell?

89
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:38,166
It's live! Come on in!

90
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,833
Is this the haunted building?

91
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,791
It's so cool.

92
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,333
-Let's go upstairs.
-Be patient. Wait for me.

93
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,166
Hey, eventually...

94
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,166
It's so cool...

95
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,791
-Hey, run away!
-Scary, right?

96
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,750
They're going inside?

97
00:07:57,166 --> 00:07:58,541
Surely not!

98
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,583
Take a look.

99
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,583
But we're going to do it differently.

100
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,333
We'll go there. We'll be getting upstairs,
doing a live stream...

101
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:07,208
That will be very spooky.

102
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:10,500
So, many people will watch it live,
and it will increase your followers.

103
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,583
That's it!

104
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,125
Still talking about your plan, Ben?

105
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,583
I've got to get at least one person.

106
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,666
-Hey, Erik!
-What?

107
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,000
Why are you changing your shirt?

108
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:22,333
Hey, Rik!

109
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,208
This is Friday the kliwon, right?

110
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,833
I will ask other friends.

111
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,875
We will do a live stream there.
What do you think?

112
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,458
Are you serious?

113
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:34,582
I will ask other friends too, like Alex.
Come and join us!

114
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,582
Hey, you guys know me, right?

115
00:08:43,582 --> 00:08:45,167
How dare you?
Give me your cellphones.

116
00:08:46,792 --> 00:08:48,582
Bite this! Bite!

117
00:08:48,917 --> 00:08:50,832
I am sure Erik will come with us.

118
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,957
But Alex, you see yourself,
he could be mad.

119
00:08:54,042 --> 00:08:56,875
-Come on.
-Wait, wait, Erik.

120
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,957
I'll take this first.

121
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:02,000
They're only juniors.
Come on, don't get too emotional.

122
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,332
Don't stare at me, huh?

123
00:09:04,542 --> 00:09:08,292
-Don't you guys dare to look at me!
-Calm down.

124
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,625
Are you sure Linda will come?

125
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:11,750
Jess...

126
00:09:12,125 --> 00:09:14,457
Linda knows the building security officer.

127
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,707
Well, you should give her some guarantee,
so that she would come along.

128
00:09:20,292 --> 00:09:22,957
I think people will like
that kind of spooky show.

129
00:09:23,082 --> 00:09:24,500
The building is also popular.

130
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:29,000
People quite often
talk about that building lately.

131
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:32,125
And I got some news yesterday
about that building.

132
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,750
-Really?
-Yeah.

133
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:39,917
There was a child kidnapping
on the sixth floor.

134
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:42,667
The police rescued the child.

135
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,042
There was a shooting, and eventually
the boy was saved.

136
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:50,250
But I don't know
if it is true or not.

137
00:09:50,832 --> 00:09:53,332
It is posted in 2008.

138
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,250
And now the building is empty.

139
00:09:57,042 --> 00:10:00,125
Wow! Cool, this will be great!
Come on guys, we'll do it!

140
00:10:00,832 --> 00:10:03,167
-Okay?
-Serious? We'll do it?

141
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,625
Oh, shit!

142
00:10:07,832 --> 00:10:11,750
-You really did it!
-For sure!

143
00:10:17,167 --> 00:10:18,375
Come and join what?

144
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:21,082
The plan about that building.

145
00:10:21,832 --> 00:10:24,417
-Over there?
-Yes.

146
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:28,042
I will surely go, damn! Come on!

147
00:10:29,957 --> 00:10:32,875
Lin, please consider what I say first.

148
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:34,457
It's simple...

149
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:36,792
You know the security guy
who works there, so...

150
00:10:37,332 --> 00:10:39,082
We really need your help.

151
00:10:39,875 --> 00:10:42,250
So, I have to quit my job?

152
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,707
I will be finished.

153
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,957
You could ask for a leave or something.

154
00:10:47,832 --> 00:10:48,707
Ben...

155
00:10:49,332 --> 00:10:51,082
Mr. Eep has already told me,

156
00:10:51,207 --> 00:10:54,625
I make one more mistake,
I will not work here anymore.

157
00:10:55,207 --> 00:10:57,417
I really need this job.

158
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,207
You know my family.

159
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,042
Just one time.

160
00:11:02,207 --> 00:11:04,500
You could ask someone to replace you.

161
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:08,207
I could lose a chance
to study in college.

162
00:11:09,707 --> 00:11:11,167
I'll help.

163
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,207
Linda, right?

164
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:20,250
Just take it easy.

165
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:24,207
These earrings cost quite a lot.

166
00:11:24,707 --> 00:11:27,167
This is my guarantee.

167
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:31,832
I'll transfer the rest when we're back,
so you don't need to work here anymore.

168
00:12:03,832 --> 00:12:05,917
-Thank you so much, Sir.
-You're welcome.

169
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,042
Be careful, okay?

170
00:12:08,957 --> 00:12:12,125
We're at the apartment
in block D right now.

171
00:12:12,417 --> 00:12:14,582
Just look behind me.

172
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,500
There is barbwire along the road.

173
00:12:26,042 --> 00:12:29,417
Oh, I'm scared, the place is very spooky.

174
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,207
Alex gets so ridiculous.

175
00:12:35,042 --> 00:12:37,250
This is Miss Dian...

176
00:12:37,832 --> 00:12:40,417
What is she doing, being so busy?

177
00:12:41,832 --> 00:12:43,375
Why is this building empty?

178
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:45,875
There must be some reason.

179
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,125
It's very spooky.

180
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,582
Guys, well, that's it.

181
00:12:54,082 --> 00:12:55,875
Shall we come in right away?

182
00:12:56,707 --> 00:12:57,957
Hey, Rik...

183
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:00,082
will you come with us?

184
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,457
Come on!

185
00:13:03,375 --> 00:13:04,957
I'll be waiting right here.

186
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,582
We're just having fun here.

187
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,667
Let's have some fun for a while,

188
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,667
then we go home. Okay?

189
00:13:14,207 --> 00:13:16,125
-Come on, Erik! Quick!
-Okay!

190
00:13:23,042 --> 00:13:25,082
-Erik, come on.
-Let's go.

191
00:13:35,707 --> 00:13:37,042
Alex...

192
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:38,957
Beni...

193
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,250
Dian...

194
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,707
Where are you, guys?

195
00:13:46,707 --> 00:13:48,500
Erik, what is happening?

196
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,417
Why is it only two of us?

197
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,457
Okay, guys, we're already upstairs.

198
00:13:53,957 --> 00:13:55,417
We're on the top floor.

199
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,582
The building is very old.

200
00:13:59,832 --> 00:14:01,167
It's so dark in here.

201
00:14:02,792 --> 00:14:05,167
-Erik, where are the others?
-Jess!

202
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,250
-Behind you! Watch out!
-What?

203
00:14:11,832 --> 00:14:13,542
What is that?

204
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:15,457
Erik, you go first.

205
00:14:15,707 --> 00:14:17,457
You go first.

206
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,667
I swear, it was here.

207
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,207
Rik, I'm scared.

208
00:14:28,792 --> 00:14:30,582
Where are the others?

209
00:14:33,917 --> 00:14:36,542
Beni? Lex?

210
00:14:44,457 --> 00:14:45,625
What I've told you!

211
00:14:51,832 --> 00:14:53,917
Ouch! Rik!

212
00:14:55,417 --> 00:14:58,000
-The live stream stopped, man!
-I am sorry.

213
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:01,000
I am sorry, I shouldn't get in the way.

214
00:15:05,042 --> 00:15:06,042
Shit! Damn you, Lex.

215
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:10,167
Damn it! We shouldn't have fallen down.

216
00:15:11,457 --> 00:15:13,042
I've been waiting for so long.

217
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,457
We've stopped the live stream?

218
00:15:14,792 --> 00:15:16,082
Definitely no.

219
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,082
Shit! We don't do this?

220
00:15:18,332 --> 00:15:20,750
Let's look for another place.

221
00:15:21,332 --> 00:15:22,500
Take a look at this!

222
00:15:22,875 --> 00:15:25,957
There were five hundred people
watching my live stream.

223
00:15:26,292 --> 00:15:29,000
We shouldn't have stood in the middle.
I could have got more.

224
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:31,582
But the followers increased, right?

225
00:15:31,707 --> 00:15:33,167
You ruined it!

226
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:39,167
Well, I'll tell you what.

227
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,542
We'll do it again from the start.

228
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,332
The signal is also bad, right?

229
00:15:43,792 --> 00:15:45,417
We'll try in the corridor...

230
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
over there.

231
00:15:50,542 --> 00:15:52,042
Kang Heri already told me

232
00:15:53,917 --> 00:15:55,750
we may play here,

233
00:15:55,957 --> 00:15:57,250
but we may not...

234
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,832
pass through the corridor
that has the police line.

235
00:16:03,667 --> 00:16:06,542
But if the signal over there
is better, why not?

236
00:16:06,792 --> 00:16:08,125
We'll just do a live stream.

237
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:09,792
There will be no problem, right?

238
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,792
There, the light is turning on.
It means it's safe over there.

239
00:16:15,332 --> 00:16:16,332
Come on.

240
00:16:17,542 --> 00:16:18,792
Come on, Ben.

241
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:21,000
Come on, Ben

242
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:25,082
Shit, it's so dirty, Ben.

243
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,792
Let's go out of here.

244
00:16:26,917 --> 00:16:28,167
It's so dirty.

245
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:39,082
Is there any signal here?

246
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,957
Ew.

247
00:16:42,457 --> 00:16:43,582
Jess?

248
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,875
-We have to let our family know.
-There is a police line here, but...

249
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,500
It's so complicated!

250
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:52,082
Why don't we just get in?

251
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:55,207
Who knows, maybe we will find
spooky things, so...

252
00:16:55,417 --> 00:16:56,750
It will be an interesting live stream.

253
00:16:58,167 --> 00:17:00,500
There, we got the signal again, come on!

254
00:17:00,707 --> 00:17:02,707
Wait, there is a police line here, right?

255
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,625
We may not touch this.

256
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,041
-Are you sure you want to get in here?
-That will be fun, Rik. That's the point.

257
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:16,000
Lex, be patient.
Lex, I'm serious!

258
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,916
It's already late, right?

259
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:21,416
Why don't we do a live stream
while we're going downstairs?

260
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,541
-Okay?
-Hey, you, bro,

261
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,083
you're so good-looking,
but have small balls!

262
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,458
Why do we wait for so long?
The signal could be gone!

263
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,125
I'll tell you what.

264
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:33,083
We try to get in first,

265
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,458
if there's no problem,
we'll continue,

266
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,416
if it is not okay...
we'll go downstairs.

267
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:38,833
Excuse me!

268
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:40,708
What the hell, Lex?

269
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,416
What's the problem?
Are you getting in or not?

270
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,916
-That's not the right way!
-How do we get in?

271
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,625
Where did you get that?

272
00:17:48,291 --> 00:17:49,916
All right, let's try it first.

273
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,458
-We could use this, right?
-Be careful!

274
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,291
Lex.

275
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,125
Lex.

276
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,458
-You get in first, Lex.
-Come on.

277
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,791
It should be ladies first, right?

278
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,666
You smell something?

279
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,958
Rik!

280
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,750
A dead snake.

281
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:01,458
Rik, it is dangerous!

282
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,541
What the hell is that?

283
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:21,875
What the fuck is this?!

284
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,875
What the hell are you doing, Alex?

285
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,250
What, I just leaned on you?

286
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:33,041
Don't even try to touch me, right?

287
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,041
Okay, now we get it right.

288
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,041
We've already got into the apartment.

289
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,041
The room is so spooky.

290
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:41,541
It's very narrow,
and there is a strange smell.

291
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:43,625
See for yourself.

292
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:46,250
There are many sheets of paper.

293
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,166
-What is this?
-Lex!

294
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:55,791
-What the hell?
-Damn, we've got no signal again!

295
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,875
Why has the signal has gone again?

296
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:08,500
Hold the head!

297
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,000
Hold it! Read!

298
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:18,750
The writing will show up, right?

299
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,750
Hold the head!

300
00:20:22,958 --> 00:20:24,166
What's wrong with you?

301
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,458
Signal, please...

302
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,125
Well, I don't know.

303
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,875
I feel I've been here before.

304
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,083
What do you mean?

305
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,250
I just don't know.

306
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,166
As soon as we got in here...

307
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:39,125
I felt...

308
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,750
I have already seen these things.

309
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,250
Okay, I've got the signal!

310
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:53,166
Jess, I think it's time to leave!

311
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
-Yeah!
-Rik! Ssshhh!

312
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:00,416
Hey!

313
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,875
Jess, Lex. Look at this, it's so big.

314
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:07,291
What the hell is that?

315
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,083
Damn you!

316
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,958
-Don't be ridiculous. What the hell?
-There is a snake skin,

317
00:21:13,125 --> 00:21:14,333
there must be the real snake.

318
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:15,750
Just be careful!

319
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,208
-Alex.
-Lex.

320
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,083
-That's so disgusting, eww.
-The smell comes from here.

321
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:29,958
-I'm sure of it.
-Okay, guys.

322
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,583
Okay guys, now we find something.

323
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,083
Mr. Alex please try to explain.

324
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:36,708
Well, audience...

325
00:21:37,083 --> 00:21:38,583
we find here...

326
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,750
a dead snake.

327
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,833
Yeah, snake, guys.

328
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,708
-It's so spooky.
-The snake tried to get out, but...

329
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,541
its head got stuck, look at that!

330
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,875
Be careful, Lex.

331
00:21:50,083 --> 00:21:52,041
Quick, open it!

332
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,250
-Be careful.
-Yeah.

333
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:57,125
Yeah, all right, we try to open it.

334
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:00,625
Be careful.

335
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,541
Check it out, Lex.

336
00:22:06,208 --> 00:22:07,791
Ew.

337
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:10,583
What the hell is that?

338
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,041
Let me try.

339
00:22:21,875 --> 00:22:25,083
Be careful. Alex, Alex!

340
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,666
Just be serious, shit.

341
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,041
Shit, it's painful, Rik!

342
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:37,708
Be serious, Alex!

343
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:43,458
-Be serious.
-Yeah, yeah.

344
00:23:01,625 --> 00:23:04,000
I cannot open this. Look at that.

345
00:23:05,625 --> 00:23:07,000
Damn, what kind of comics are these?

346
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:08,875
Yeah, what kind of comics?

347
00:23:09,083 --> 00:23:11,083
There are plenty of them.
Just try to spread them.

348
00:23:13,583 --> 00:23:16,541
Bro, it's some kind of bad handwriting.

349
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:19,250
It's not a bad handwriting, Man.

350
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,083
Look, this is...

351
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,541
in Sanskrit.

352
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,500
The Javanese characters but...

353
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:29,541
it's a bit different.

354
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:34,041
How do you know? Damn,
you play too much with Uncle Google.

355
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:35,458
What is this for?

356
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:39,916
The picture is the same
as the one over there.

357
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,666
It's the same picture on the floor.

358
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:45,333
Just a moment.

359
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:51,208
Look at this.

360
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,875
That's right, Lin, that's the same.

361
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:15,291
Lin.

362
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:21,875
What's wrong with you?

363
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:24,958
We'll get out of here soon, right?

364
00:24:25,416 --> 00:24:26,916
Yeah, just a moment.

365
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,208
Jess, Jess.

366
00:24:30,375 --> 00:24:32,500
Damn, no battery power!

367
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:37,291
This sucks!

368
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:40,958
Jess, your cellphone is off right?

369
00:24:41,208 --> 00:24:42,500
We go downstairs after this.

370
00:24:42,708 --> 00:24:43,916
Try to take a picture again.

371
00:24:50,625 --> 00:24:52,083
I'll send it...

372
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:57,500
-Anything else?
-Take the pictures one at a time.

373
00:24:57,583 --> 00:25:00,291
Welcome us to your presence.

374
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:17,208
Lin, what's wrong with you?

375
00:25:17,958 --> 00:25:19,916
What is it, Lin?

376
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:22,500
-What is it, Lin?
-What's wrong with you?

377
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:24,041
Lin!

378
00:25:25,166 --> 00:25:27,958
-Did you see it? There is some writing.
-See what?

379
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,291
There was some writing
when she took the picture.

380
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,250
What writing?

381
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,041
Take a picture, there is some writing.

382
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,083
The writing shone, Rik.

383
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:48,500
-This one is empty, Linda.
-There is some writing on the paper.

384
00:25:49,166 --> 00:25:51,750
Is really there some writing?

385
00:25:52,041 --> 00:25:53,958
Just take pictures of other things, Lex.

386
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,916
The writing shone,
when I took the picture.

387
00:26:04,708 --> 00:26:06,208
There was some writing, right, Rik!

388
00:26:07,375 --> 00:26:10,458
Lex, Ben, Rik, Jess,
there is writing, right?

389
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:12,666
-Look at that!
-There is nothing, Linda.

390
00:26:12,791 --> 00:26:17,083
-This shone!
-Let me check it first, just a moment.

391
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,791
It's so weird, it's empty, right?

392
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,458
You can read it, right?

393
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,666
You guys are not kidding me, right?

394
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,875
-There is nothing, Lin.
-There is no writing at all.

395
00:26:28,041 --> 00:26:29,541
You guys are not playing a prank on me?

396
00:26:29,875 --> 00:26:31,375
Why would we do that?

397
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:34,208
Why do I see what you don't see?

398
00:26:34,916 --> 00:26:36,125
It's really weird.

399
00:26:54,666 --> 00:26:58,833
Those who reside in the mystical world.

400
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:03,791
Draw open your gate.

401
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:13,375
Welcome us...

402
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:19,125
to your presence.

403
00:27:24,916 --> 00:27:26,125
What the hell is that?

404
00:27:51,291 --> 00:27:54,958
Whoa... What is happening?

405
00:27:57,333 --> 00:28:00,041
Lex, what is happening?

406
00:28:00,291 --> 00:28:01,791
We have to go home now, Jess.

407
00:28:02,166 --> 00:28:05,000
We have to go home!

408
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:46,625
Guys?

409
00:29:49,041 --> 00:29:51,041
Alex, Erik!

410
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,791
Dian!

411
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:56,041
Beni!

412
00:30:13,416 --> 00:30:15,625
Ben, quick!

413
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:17,625
Where are Jessica and Linda?

414
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:19,416
Jess.

415
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,208
Erik, Erik!

416
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,916
Erik!

417
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:52,083
-Where is Jessica?
-Isn't she with Linda?

418
00:30:52,291 --> 00:30:55,541
This pool has no bottom!

419
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,833
It's so deep.

420
00:31:00,833 --> 00:31:02,916
Watch out! Come on, quick!

421
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,541
Kang Heri!

422
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,125
The floor suddenly opened up
and flooded with water.

423
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:29,500
Yes, Sir.

424
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:33,958
-Our friends are drowning upstairs. Help!
-Wait a minute, wait a minute.

425
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,791
-Drowning?
-That's right.

426
00:35:38,541 --> 00:35:39,666
Are you crazy?

427
00:35:41,125 --> 00:35:44,000
I've told you not to cross
the police line.

428
00:35:44,208 --> 00:35:45,708
You crossed it, right?

429
00:35:46,666 --> 00:35:48,833
Then he said, his friends
were drowned and died?

430
00:35:50,708 --> 00:35:52,083
Drowned in an apartment?

431
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:57,416
Am I drunk or you guys...

432
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:00,166
What happened to his face?

433
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:04,083
That is really what's happened.

434
00:36:04,458 --> 00:36:06,333
Hey! You there!

435
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,208
Don't do that!

436
00:36:11,083 --> 00:36:13,625
Listen, there's no pool up there at all.

437
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,291
Sir! See it for yourself!

438
00:36:18,041 --> 00:36:20,375
Please, help us, sir!

439
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:23,125
Jessica and Linda are still in the pool.

440
00:36:23,333 --> 00:36:24,833
Shh! Quiet!

441
00:36:28,166 --> 00:36:30,833
I can't lose my job
just because of what you told me!

442
00:36:30,916 --> 00:36:33,083
No. That won't be happening!

443
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,583
No one may go out
until I find out what's happening. Period!

444
00:36:38,583 --> 00:36:39,833
Please, help us.

445
00:36:40,291 --> 00:36:42,708
-Please, help us, Sir!
-Damn it!

446
00:36:46,791 --> 00:36:48,958
-Now what, Rik?
-He won't help us.

447
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:52,125
Come on, you guys want me to see it.

448
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:56,000
Come on!

449
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:59,708
-Come on!
-I don't want to go!

450
00:38:19,375 --> 00:38:20,666
Peace be upon you.

451
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,500
Peace be upon you.

452
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:53,416
We're...

453
00:40:54,958 --> 00:40:57,666
going to play now.

454
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,791
But first,

455
00:41:04,166 --> 00:41:06,541
let's tidy up your hair.

456
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:16,750
Jess!

457
00:42:22,458 --> 00:42:24,333
Wake up, Jess!

458
00:42:25,208 --> 00:42:28,166
Jess, wake up!

459
00:42:28,958 --> 00:42:31,083
Are you okay, Jess?

460
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:34,416
Are you okay, right?

461
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:39,875
-Where are we, Lin?
-I don't know, it's a different place.

462
00:42:40,041 --> 00:42:41,208
Lin.

463
00:42:41,458 --> 00:42:44,500
-Why am I wearing this dress, Lin?
-I don't know.

464
00:42:44,708 --> 00:42:47,000
-Where are we?
-Shh! Jess!

465
00:42:50,791 --> 00:42:51,875
I don't know either.

466
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:54,375
I saw her change
your dress, but I don't know who she is.

467
00:42:54,750 --> 00:42:56,250
But we must get out of here.

468
00:42:57,375 --> 00:42:58,791
We must get out of here.

469
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,708
Do you want to play too?

470
00:43:30,416 --> 00:43:31,916
What are you doing here?

471
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:34,458
You stayed with me forever!

472
00:43:58,291 --> 00:44:00,291
Jess!

473
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:08,166
There is a leak from the pipe.

474
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:11,958
Your friends were drowned and died.

475
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,958
If there is a leak from the pipe,
it won't be flooded like this.

476
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,791
We're on the sixth floor, anyway.

477
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:18,916
Such a whirlpool
shouldn't even exist here.

478
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:23,958
Yeah.

479
00:45:27,916 --> 00:45:30,250
So, they got stuck.

480
00:45:33,166 --> 00:45:34,500
What do you mean "stuck"?

481
00:45:34,625 --> 00:45:36,083
That's a weird thing.

482
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:37,750
There must be something wrong.

483
00:45:41,833 --> 00:45:42,833
I'm so confused.

484
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:47,250
Is there any signal here?

485
00:45:47,375 --> 00:45:49,458
If there were any,
I would have made a telephone call.

486
00:45:53,875 --> 00:45:55,083
Rik!

487
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,416
Come here, Rik!

488
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:05,458
Something is very wrong, Rik.

489
00:46:05,708 --> 00:46:07,833
We'd better get out of here now!

490
00:46:08,041 --> 00:46:10,333
Ask him to give us the key,
then we'll get out!

491
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,416
What about Jessica and Linda, Lex!

492
00:46:16,125 --> 00:46:17,833
They have been lost!

493
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:19,375
Hey!

494
00:46:19,541 --> 00:46:21,416
You guys want to get out?

495
00:46:23,041 --> 00:46:24,208
You'd better think!

496
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:26,791
The police will investigate you.

497
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:29,041
Your friends are drowned and dead.

498
00:46:29,458 --> 00:46:30,875
I don't want to get into trouble.

499
00:46:31,833 --> 00:46:34,583
If they drowned and are dead,
their bodies should float to the surface.

500
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,416
I have dived into the pool.
It's got no bottom!

501
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:39,458
It's a whirlpool, sir!

502
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,000
And if their bodies come up,

503
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:45,041
how would you explain that? Huh!

504
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,000
Shit!

505
00:46:52,416 --> 00:46:53,791
They're all dead!

506
00:47:00,166 --> 00:47:01,875
Let me try!

507
00:47:02,208 --> 00:47:03,416
Let's find out.

508
00:47:05,041 --> 00:47:06,291
What does this mean?

509
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:09,250
There's also water here,
like it is in here.

510
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,083
He held a kris.

511
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:22,666
Kris?

512
00:47:27,208 --> 00:47:28,125
This...

513
00:47:30,791 --> 00:47:32,500
There is a woman here...

514
00:47:33,291 --> 00:47:35,041
and this woman looked like...

515
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:37,208
she was being attacked by many people.

516
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:44,500
It seems that these people
on this paper

517
00:47:44,916 --> 00:47:46,500
were all dead, bro.

518
00:47:46,666 --> 00:47:47,750
Look at that!

519
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:50,750
The only man who survived
was the guy at the front line.

520
00:47:51,041 --> 00:47:52,416
-Isn't that right?
-Yes.

521
00:47:52,958 --> 00:47:54,916
He was going to be brought out
from that realm.

522
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:57,833
A swimming pool, and a house.

523
00:47:59,416 --> 00:48:00,625
Ben, take a look at this!

524
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,000
Does this mean

525
00:48:02,666 --> 00:48:04,416
there is a house across the pool?

526
00:48:04,625 --> 00:48:06,000
Isn't that right?

527
00:48:08,708 --> 00:48:12,250
There is a house,
and it is in another realm, right?

528
00:48:12,625 --> 00:48:15,791
And it is the same house!

529
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:19,458
This is water, so it means...

530
00:48:20,541 --> 00:48:21,666
It means...

531
00:48:27,458 --> 00:48:29,291
It seems that the pool is the door.

532
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:34,541
And we shouldn't go through the door.

533
00:48:34,625 --> 00:48:36,416
So, it's some kind of a portal, right?

534
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:40,041
Maybe Jessica and Linda
are in that realm.

535
00:48:56,625 --> 00:48:58,833
Jess! Jess!

536
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:02,041
Jess, wake up! Jess!

537
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:04,625
Jess! Jess!

538
00:49:05,500 --> 00:49:08,208
Jess, wake up!

539
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:10,583
Are you all right?

540
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:13,708
Are you all right?

541
00:49:14,166 --> 00:49:15,458
I am very dizzy.

542
00:49:15,708 --> 00:49:17,000
Can you walk?

543
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:20,041
Come on, let's get out of here.

544
00:49:26,083 --> 00:49:27,250
Jess, come on!

545
00:49:28,958 --> 00:49:30,625
Where is my cellphone?

546
00:49:30,750 --> 00:49:32,208
Forget it, Jess.

547
00:49:32,416 --> 00:49:34,083
Come on! Quick!

548
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:05,791
Jessica! Jessica!

549
00:50:07,875 --> 00:50:09,041
There is no signal.

550
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:14,125
Forget it, let's get out of here.

551
00:50:14,875 --> 00:50:16,791
Come on, we get out of here now!

552
00:50:23,166 --> 00:50:25,041
You killed my sister!

553
00:50:27,625 --> 00:50:30,458
Go away!

554
00:50:38,583 --> 00:50:40,833
Quick, Jess.

555
00:50:43,208 --> 00:50:45,250
This way, Jess.

556
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:47,208
Follow me!

557
00:50:47,791 --> 00:50:49,166
This way.

558
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:53,333
This way!

559
00:51:17,666 --> 00:51:19,125
Jess!

560
00:51:21,916 --> 00:51:23,875
Jess!

561
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,750
Jess! Jess!

562
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:45,583
Calm down, Di.

563
00:51:45,833 --> 00:51:48,000
I'm sure they're still alive, okay?

564
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:57,083
Sir, please give me
the gate key right now!

565
00:51:57,666 --> 00:51:59,000
No way!
I would not do that.

566
00:51:59,375 --> 00:52:01,583
If it's true that your friends
have all drowned and died,

567
00:52:01,791 --> 00:52:04,333
you should take their bodies.
You should all be responsible!

568
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:05,791
Alex is right, sir.

569
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,250
I know somebody
who understands this kind of matter, so...

570
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:10,916
So, we'd better get out of here.

571
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,708
We will ask for his help, sir!

572
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:14,458
No way!
I would not do that.

573
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:16,916
-I will not let something like this...
-Ben, the key!

574
00:52:17,416 --> 00:52:19,625
Lex! Alex!

575
00:52:23,791 --> 00:52:25,750
Shut up!

576
00:52:28,750 --> 00:52:30,375
Don't make this night more fucked up!

577
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:50,875
Linda! Linda!

578
00:52:53,458 --> 00:52:54,833
Get her.

579
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:57,250
Lin, are you all right?

580
00:52:57,875 --> 00:53:01,291
Lin, are you okay?

581
00:53:04,083 --> 00:53:06,375
Jessica? Is she still alive?

582
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,500
-Jessica is in the water?
-Where is she?

583
00:53:09,166 --> 00:53:11,666
Jessica is still in there.

584
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:13,041
Move away.

585
00:53:13,208 --> 00:53:14,833
I must help her.

586
00:53:15,083 --> 00:53:17,500
Don't be ridiculous.
You're going to dive again?

587
00:53:19,291 --> 00:53:21,291
Rik, you should do that. Come on, Rik!

588
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:29,041
What is that, Ben?

589
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,166
Rik, over there.

590
00:53:42,625 --> 00:53:44,708
Jessica, bro.

591
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,416
Jessica!

592
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:53,458
Jess! Jess!

593
00:53:53,666 --> 00:53:54,666
Jessica!

594
00:53:55,541 --> 00:53:56,625
Jess?

595
00:53:56,750 --> 00:53:58,083
Why is she wearing this dress?

596
00:53:58,750 --> 00:54:00,166
I met her.

597
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:03,416
-But she's already changed her dress.
-Did she change her dress under the water?

598
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:07,000
Jess, wake up!

599
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:09,666
Jess, can you hear me?

600
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:11,625
She is unconscious, bro.

601
00:54:12,541 --> 00:54:14,000
She's got no pulse, bro.

602
00:54:14,541 --> 00:54:18,166
- Jess, wake up!
- Jess! Jess!

603
00:54:18,791 --> 00:54:20,958
Quick! Do it!

604
00:54:25,958 --> 00:54:27,458
Jess, are you okay?

605
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,875
Jessica!

606
00:54:29,291 --> 00:54:31,333
-Jessica, wake up!
-Jess!

607
00:54:32,291 --> 00:54:34,541
-Are you okay, Jess?
-What the hell happened, bro?

608
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,541
What's wrong with this kid?

609
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:05,041
Jess?

610
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:07,375
That's not her.

611
00:55:08,625 --> 00:55:09,875
Jess, come back to us!

612
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:16,583
I'm your friend...

613
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,708
"I'm your friend."

614
00:55:21,375 --> 00:55:22,333
Damn!

615
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,583
That's the ancient language
my great-grandparents used to speak.

616
00:55:26,541 --> 00:55:31,750
You took what was mine,

617
00:55:33,958 --> 00:55:38,458
now you're all going to die!

618
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:44,708
Jess, wake up!
I know this isn't you.

619
00:55:46,916 --> 00:55:52,041
-Bro, recite something!
-What do you want me to do?

620
00:56:06,458 --> 00:56:08,208
Oh man, I forget the rest...

621
00:56:11,041 --> 00:56:12,166
Lady...

622
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:14,916
It's only a temptation.

623
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:19,375
Lady, calm down!

624
00:56:20,958 --> 00:56:22,500
Lady, calm down!

625
00:56:37,750 --> 00:56:39,125
Jess! Jess!

626
00:56:42,541 --> 00:56:45,583
Let me go.

627
00:57:33,125 --> 00:57:34,166
Where...

628
00:57:34,708 --> 00:57:35,750
are we?

629
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:50,041
Jess?

630
00:58:14,708 --> 00:58:17,166
Where is the kris?

631
00:58:28,208 --> 00:58:29,541
Jess, don't do that!

632
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:35,833
Come back to us, Jess!

633
00:58:50,583 --> 00:58:53,208
Jessica! Jessica!

634
00:58:56,250 --> 00:58:57,875
Erik!!

635
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:04,875
Come back to us, Jessica!

636
00:59:12,291 --> 00:59:13,625
Give Jessica back to us, damn you!

637
01:00:05,666 --> 01:00:06,625
Guys?

638
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:47,916
Lex?

639
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:52,125
Di?

640
01:01:24,916 --> 01:01:25,833
Help us, Lin!

641
01:01:28,041 --> 01:01:29,666
Help us, Lin!

642
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:46,333
This will help
not to feel too dizzy, Lin.

643
01:01:50,666 --> 01:01:52,000
I don't know why

644
01:01:53,208 --> 01:01:54,375
they get hurt

645
01:01:55,666 --> 01:01:57,416
when they get a flash from my cellphone.

646
01:01:59,125 --> 01:02:00,958
It must be because of your energy, Lin.

647
01:02:02,041 --> 01:02:03,791
You can see what we can't see.

648
01:02:04,666 --> 01:02:07,375
It's some kind of a talent.

649
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:23,166
I think I got the talent

650
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:25,625
from my mother, Di.

651
01:02:28,333 --> 01:02:29,333
So...

652
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:32,250
the story that we saw...

653
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:35,291
was that really you, Lin?

654
01:02:40,166 --> 01:02:41,708
Do you know who kidnapped you?

655
01:02:55,958 --> 01:02:57,583
My friends are not here anymore, Lin.

656
01:02:59,166 --> 01:03:01,291
I don't know what to do now.

657
01:03:03,041 --> 01:03:04,375
Di, look at me!

658
01:03:07,125 --> 01:03:09,291
If I can find Jessica

659
01:03:09,458 --> 01:03:11,208
and bring her back here,

660
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,166
I am completely sure

661
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:15,333
your friends are still alive.

662
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,916
We'll bring them back here.

663
01:03:18,541 --> 01:03:20,541
I am sure they're still alive, right?

664
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:23,416
Does it mean...

665
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:26,125
the story in these pictures

666
01:03:26,791 --> 01:03:27,958
really happened?

667
01:03:33,291 --> 01:03:35,208
Everything we experienced

668
01:03:36,416 --> 01:03:37,916
was told in those pictures.

669
01:03:42,416 --> 01:03:43,833
Someone reads.

670
01:03:44,916 --> 01:03:46,625
The black pool appears.

671
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:56,083
Right, this is the house
where I met Jessica.

672
01:03:58,791 --> 01:04:01,125
This is the lady in the red dress.

673
01:04:02,041 --> 01:04:04,541
She is the one who chased me
and Jessica

674
01:04:04,666 --> 01:04:07,125
and I am sure she is the one
who possessed Jessica.

675
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,500
Kris.

676
01:04:12,208 --> 01:04:14,541
Where is the kris?

677
01:04:16,541 --> 01:04:17,625
Kris.

678
01:04:27,166 --> 01:04:28,833
This kris should be put back where it was.

679
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:41,083
Lin, how we are supposed to put this back?

680
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,375
Can't you see it's already closed?

681
01:04:44,125 --> 01:04:45,458
Shall we open this again?

682
01:04:47,208 --> 01:04:49,833
Just listen to me...

683
01:04:50,083 --> 01:04:52,958
We'd better take this kris to someone
who understands this kind of thing.

684
01:04:56,041 --> 01:04:57,375
What's wrong with you, Ben?

685
01:05:00,500 --> 01:05:02,333
It seems she asked for this kris.

686
01:05:03,875 --> 01:05:06,625
Maybe if we give it to her,
everything will be settled.

687
01:05:09,833 --> 01:05:11,083
Can't you think straight, Lin?

688
01:05:11,416 --> 01:05:12,708
It's fine if it is settled.

689
01:05:12,916 --> 01:05:14,208
Otherwise, what are we going to do?

690
01:05:14,333 --> 01:05:16,166
What if she demands your life?

691
01:05:17,875 --> 01:05:19,333
Please, just trust me.

692
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:21,541
We'll get out of here now.

693
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:24,458
We'll give this kris to someone
who really understands those matters, Lin.

694
01:05:24,583 --> 01:05:26,875
How are we gonna get out of here, Ben?
You don't remember?

695
01:05:27,041 --> 01:05:28,916
The gate's already been locked up
by Kang Heri.

696
01:05:31,041 --> 01:05:32,166
Damn!

697
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:33,750
I forgot about that.

698
01:05:33,958 --> 01:05:35,291
Key?

699
01:05:37,333 --> 01:05:38,833
Isn't there any other way?

700
01:05:39,041 --> 01:05:40,416
There is no other way, Lin.

701
01:05:41,041 --> 01:05:43,166
The wall is so high,
and it's got barbwire, Lin.

702
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:58,000
Kang Heri's got the gate key in his hand.

703
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,583
Hand?

704
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:22,166
Linda! Come on!

705
01:06:31,541 --> 01:06:33,833
The kris, Lin, quick.

706
01:06:43,875 --> 01:06:45,875
Where the hell is the kris, Beni?

707
01:06:47,666 --> 01:06:49,291
Jess, wake up!

708
01:06:50,458 --> 01:06:53,416
Jess, wake up!

709
01:06:54,083 --> 01:06:59,333
-Jessica!
-Jessica, wake up!

710
01:07:00,291 --> 01:07:02,541
Ben, give it to her!

711
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:10,083
This way!

712
01:08:29,875 --> 01:08:31,125
Are you okay, Lin?

713
01:08:33,082 --> 01:08:34,500
Ben, check it out.

714
01:08:34,917 --> 01:08:36,707
Ben, check it out.

715
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:54,750
It's clear, Lin.

716
01:08:57,125 --> 01:08:58,125
Okay.

717
01:09:15,082 --> 01:09:17,332
Please don't do it!

718
01:09:21,625 --> 01:09:23,500
Let her go!

719
01:09:34,707 --> 01:09:36,292
Dian!

720
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:09,875
Damn it!

721
01:10:51,707 --> 01:10:52,832
Jess!

722
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,042
Dian!

723
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:56,457
Erik!

724
01:12:56,792 --> 01:12:58,667
You...

725
01:13:05,457 --> 01:13:08,875
You have taken what is mine.

726
01:13:43,707 --> 01:13:47,042
It's not appropriate for you to come here.

727
01:13:51,875 --> 01:13:53,042
Let them go.

728
01:13:53,707 --> 01:13:55,082
They've done nothing wrong.

729
01:14:06,957 --> 01:14:10,332
You will join them.

730
01:15:30,250 --> 01:15:34,250
This is what happens
when you come to my realm.

731
01:15:37,250 --> 01:15:40,542
You will remain here forever.

732
01:15:43,792 --> 01:15:47,000
Surrender yourself.

733
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:05,457
We've found it at last, Lin.

734
01:16:05,625 --> 01:16:06,957
Come on, let's get out, Lin.

735
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:08,832
Come on, Lin.

736
01:16:14,582 --> 01:16:15,957
Where did she go, Ben?

737
01:16:23,417 --> 01:16:24,625
The portal is closed, Lin.

738
01:16:26,167 --> 01:16:27,500
The portal is closed, Lin!

739
01:16:27,832 --> 01:16:29,375
Lin, we've got to go now.

740
01:16:29,542 --> 01:16:31,792
We've got to get out of here.
Let's find a way out.

741
01:16:31,875 --> 01:16:33,792
It's so dreadful here.
We've got to go now.

742
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:36,457
Where are we going to go now?

743
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:38,375
What now?
We've got to go, Lin!

744
01:16:38,707 --> 01:16:41,250
Before she comes up again!
Let's find a way, quick!

745
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:43,417
-Wait a moment, Ben.
-What do you mean a moment?

746
01:16:45,625 --> 01:16:48,000
-Your friends are still inside, Beni.
-What friends, Lin?

747
01:16:48,417 --> 01:16:50,667
You are more important
than all of them, Linda.

748
01:16:51,332 --> 01:16:53,707
Ben, your friends are still alive inside.

749
01:17:01,125 --> 01:17:02,457
My job is to save you, Linda.

750
01:17:02,667 --> 01:17:03,582
Ben.

751
01:17:04,332 --> 01:17:05,750
I've gone this far.

752
01:17:06,792 --> 01:17:08,417
Don't even try to mess

753
01:17:08,832 --> 01:17:11,207
with everything my family has planned.
You understand?

754
01:17:11,792 --> 01:17:13,500
It's all for the sake of
my community, Linda.

755
01:17:14,417 --> 01:17:16,542
You're the only one
who can open this portal here.

756
01:17:44,667 --> 01:17:46,332
Maybe you remember, Lin.

757
01:17:48,542 --> 01:17:50,750
A long time ago we asked your mother
to read the parchment.

758
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:54,167
And my father...

759
01:17:54,832 --> 01:17:57,082
got shot when he tried
to get this kris, Lin.

760
01:17:59,667 --> 01:18:02,917
If your mother had read it faster,
maybe my father would still be alive.

761
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:08,417
My job is to get this kris.

762
01:18:09,167 --> 01:18:11,000
And now, you open that portal, Lin.

763
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:13,457
Open that portal, Lin!

764
01:18:15,417 --> 01:18:16,500
Ben!

765
01:18:17,917 --> 01:18:19,000
Linda.

766
01:18:21,167 --> 01:18:23,167
Lin, Ben!

767
01:18:23,707 --> 01:18:24,832
Rik, Di.

768
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:27,250
Are you guys all right?

769
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,582
Rik, are you all right?

770
01:18:31,082 --> 01:18:32,917
What happened to my hand?

771
01:18:33,582 --> 01:18:35,250
What happened to my hand?

772
01:18:36,375 --> 01:18:38,625
Is it safe, Kang?

773
01:18:41,625 --> 01:18:43,167
Where is Jessica?

774
01:18:43,917 --> 01:18:44,875
Huh?

775
01:18:45,582 --> 01:18:46,792
Where is Jessica?

776
01:18:47,082 --> 01:18:48,292
Jessica?

777
01:18:48,667 --> 01:18:49,750
Jess!

778
01:18:49,917 --> 01:18:50,957
Jess!

779
01:18:51,207 --> 01:18:53,042
Jessica!

780
01:18:53,375 --> 01:18:56,457
Jess! Where is Jessica?

781
01:18:56,582 --> 01:18:57,582
Where is Jessica?

782
01:18:59,207 --> 01:19:01,457
Look at that!

783
01:19:06,207 --> 01:19:07,207
Lin.

784
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:08,500
Jess!

785
01:19:10,707 --> 01:19:12,207
Lin! Lin!

786
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:17,875
Why are we here again, Lin?

787
01:19:18,542 --> 01:19:20,625
This is really you, right, Jess?

788
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:22,707
Jessica!

789
01:19:24,750 --> 01:19:26,457
Are you aware of yourself, Jess?

790
01:19:26,625 --> 01:19:28,917
Are you okay, Jess?

791
01:19:50,792 --> 01:19:53,542
Let's get out! Go!

792
01:19:54,667 --> 01:19:56,625
Come on, let's go, quick!

793
01:20:05,082 --> 01:20:06,792
Where are we?

794
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:11,582
Erik! Come with me.

795
01:20:11,957 --> 01:20:13,957
Come on, come with me now.

796
01:20:15,417 --> 01:20:17,042
Let's go over there.

797
01:20:23,250 --> 01:20:25,500
Watch out! We take the turn here.

798
01:20:26,207 --> 01:20:27,792
Faster!

799
01:20:40,167 --> 01:20:41,875
This way, quick!

800
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,125
This way.

801
01:20:49,792 --> 01:20:51,082
Dian!

802
01:20:52,207 --> 01:20:53,542
Help!

803
01:20:53,792 --> 01:20:55,875
Help me! Guys!

804
01:20:56,250 --> 01:20:59,292
Help!

805
01:21:02,750 --> 01:21:03,750
Help!

806
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:16,000
Lin! Lin!

807
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:19,207
Let's move right now!

808
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,750
-That's Dian!
-Lin!

809
01:21:22,957 --> 01:21:24,250
Help!

810
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:25,707
Di!

811
01:21:26,957 --> 01:21:28,167
Di!

812
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:30,082
Di!

813
01:21:32,082 --> 01:21:33,542
Di!

814
01:22:13,417 --> 01:22:15,707
Come on, Di!

815
01:22:15,957 --> 01:22:17,082
Di!

816
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:19,125
Help!

817
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:22,250
Di!

818
01:22:25,332 --> 01:22:27,375
There is a pocong, Ben!

819
01:22:43,042 --> 01:22:44,082
Come on, Ben!

820
01:22:48,457 --> 01:22:49,625
Let's run, Ben!

821
01:22:50,875 --> 01:22:52,582
Where is he?

822
01:22:52,792 --> 01:22:53,832
Stop!

823
01:22:57,582 --> 01:23:00,375
We have to go away!

824
01:23:00,582 --> 01:23:02,332
There were pocong!

825
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:16,917
What is this?

826
01:23:17,582 --> 01:23:18,792
Why is it all red?

827
01:23:18,917 --> 01:23:20,750
Oh, my God!

828
01:23:28,875 --> 01:23:31,582
They will come back, guys!

829
01:23:34,750 --> 01:23:36,957
Guys! Please help me, quick!

830
01:23:38,207 --> 01:23:39,500
We're damned!

831
01:23:40,082 --> 01:23:41,625
We must find another way.

832
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:45,875
Lin, what shall we do?

833
01:23:46,457 --> 01:23:49,832
-Quick, read the parchment.
-Come on, read it, Lin.

834
01:23:51,332 --> 01:23:53,792
Lin, come on! Read it!

835
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:04,042
Those who reside in the mystical world.

836
01:24:06,750 --> 01:24:09,750
Open your gate.
Welcome us to your presence.

837
01:24:10,667 --> 01:24:14,250
Lin! Faster, Lin!

838
01:24:17,332 --> 01:24:18,332
Read it, Lin!

839
01:24:19,707 --> 01:24:21,125
Lin, come on!

840
01:24:21,207 --> 01:24:22,457
Welcome us to your presence.

841
01:24:23,292 --> 01:24:24,417
For us...

842
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:28,792
to live...

843
01:24:30,707 --> 01:24:32,207
in your world.

844
01:24:36,875 --> 01:24:38,667
Alex, Beni! Come on!

845
01:24:50,332 --> 01:24:51,500
Let's go!

846
01:24:57,582 --> 01:24:59,332
-Come on!
-Let's go!

847
01:24:59,750 --> 01:25:02,332
Come on! Guys!
Get in! Quick!

848
01:25:03,792 --> 01:25:07,207
-Quick! What are you doing?
-Come on, Lex!

849
01:25:07,792 --> 01:25:09,582
Damn it!

850
01:25:12,667 --> 01:25:15,207
It's cold, damn it!

851
01:25:15,457 --> 01:25:16,917
Lex, quick!

852
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:37,082
Come on, Di!

853
01:25:37,207 --> 01:25:39,417
-Yes, come on.
-I go first?

854
01:25:39,500 --> 01:25:40,875
It's safe!

855
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:42,957
Damn it!

856
01:25:48,625 --> 01:25:50,332
Come on. Who's next?

857
01:25:51,207 --> 01:25:52,625
All right, come on, sir.

858
01:25:52,750 --> 01:25:54,625
-Ouch, that hurts!
-You go first!

859
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:56,707
I am sorry. You stay here.

860
01:25:56,832 --> 01:25:58,707
You take care of those two.
I'll save Kang Heri.

861
01:26:01,042 --> 01:26:04,207
-Are we really going to dive in?
-Sure! Don't you want to go home?

862
01:26:04,292 --> 01:26:06,375
Take a deep breath, sir!

863
01:26:06,625 --> 01:26:08,292
One, two, three!

864
01:26:11,582 --> 01:26:14,082
-Jessica...
-No, I'll go first!

865
01:26:18,875 --> 01:26:20,750
- Where is my kris, Lin? Where is it?
- I don't know.

866
01:26:20,917 --> 01:26:22,667
You've hidden it, right? Where's your bag!

867
01:26:23,042 --> 01:26:24,417
What the hell, Ben!

868
01:26:24,542 --> 01:26:27,082
Damn it!

869
01:26:27,667 --> 01:26:29,375
Ben!

870
01:26:31,582 --> 01:26:33,500
Jess!

871
01:26:41,917 --> 01:26:43,832
Yes! Yes!

872
01:26:44,875 --> 01:26:46,417
Where are you going?

873
01:27:01,875 --> 01:27:03,000
Jess!

874
01:27:55,417 --> 01:27:57,875
The time has come.

875
01:28:06,667 --> 01:28:10,332
You will die here.

876
01:28:23,082 --> 01:28:24,957
Not now!

877
01:28:45,375 --> 01:28:47,082
Jess! Jess!

878
01:28:48,332 --> 01:28:49,500
Jess!

879
01:28:54,792 --> 01:28:57,000
Jess! Wake up!

880
01:28:57,125 --> 01:28:58,332
We have to go, Jess!

881
01:28:59,332 --> 01:29:01,917
-Jess! Jess!
-Where are we?

882
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,667
Come on, Jess.

883
01:29:03,832 --> 01:29:05,792
We have to go now.

884
01:29:16,582 --> 01:29:18,375
Linda! Lin!

885
01:29:18,832 --> 01:29:21,250
Pull her out!

886
01:29:39,957 --> 01:29:41,250
Where is Beni, Lin?

887
01:29:42,500 --> 01:29:43,667
Where is Beni?

888
01:29:44,082 --> 01:29:45,292
Where is Beni?

889
01:29:46,792 --> 01:29:49,332
-Lin, read it again.
-Read it again, Lin.

890
01:29:49,542 --> 01:29:50,832
We must save Beni.

891
01:29:51,917 --> 01:29:54,250
Lin, come on, read it.

892
01:29:55,082 --> 01:29:58,417
Those who reside in the mystical world.

893
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:02,957
Open your gate.

894
01:30:03,707 --> 01:30:05,917
Welcome us to your presence,

895
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:08,875
for us to live in your world.

896
01:30:13,417 --> 01:30:16,042
Lin, try again. One more time.

897
01:30:19,457 --> 01:30:22,292
Those who reside in the mystical world.

898
01:30:23,042 --> 01:30:25,707
Open your gate.

899
01:30:26,167 --> 01:30:28,500
Welcome us to your presence,

900
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:31,500
for us to live in your world.

901
01:30:34,292 --> 01:30:36,667
It won't open up.

902
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:39,917
Where is Beni?

903
01:30:41,957 --> 01:30:43,125
Ben...

904
01:30:44,207 --> 01:30:45,542
Hey, guys, listen!

905
01:30:56,042 --> 01:30:57,332
It's already dawn, guys.

906
01:30:59,167 --> 01:31:01,082
The door won't open again.

907
01:31:10,500 --> 01:31:11,500
Ben!

908
01:31:27,082 --> 01:31:29,082
Anybody want to get my hand back?

909
01:32:46,332 --> 01:32:47,625
Be patient, Kang Heri.
