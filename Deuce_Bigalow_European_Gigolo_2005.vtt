I'm starving.

12:32.495 --> 12:33.897
It's a little dry.

12:33.997 --> 12:36.800
-Keep eatin'. It gets better.
-Hmm.

12:36.900 --> 12:39.269
-Ya sure you don't want any?
-No.

12:39.369 --> 12:41.672
Never been high,
never gonna be.

12:43.941 --> 12:47.177
It's pretty good cake, though.
Fuckin' excellent.

12:54.151 --> 12:56.987
* Nights in white satin

12:58.155 --> 13:02.125
* Never reaching the end

13:03.493 --> 13:06.229
* Letters I've written

13:06.329 --> 13:08.265
Whoo!

13:08.365 --> 13:10.634
* Never meaning to send

13:13.270 --> 13:17.274
* Beauty I'd always missed

13:17.374 --> 13:20.911

13:23.346 --> 13:24.815
You.

13:27.484 --> 13:28.952
Come on in here.

13:29.052 --> 13:31.154
You, you want me to...

13:31.254 --> 13:32.756
Yes, you.

13:35.225 --> 13:39.763
* Yes, I love you
Oh, how I love you

13:45.202 --> 13:48.772
* Oh, oh
Oh, how I love you *

13:51.809 --> 13:53.443
Maybe you can help me.

13:53.543 --> 13:55.145
Really?

13:55.245 --> 13:57.915
I don't want a man who is
chiseled, and sculpted.

13:59.349 --> 14:02.052
I like soft and weak.

14:02.152 --> 14:03.353
You do?

14:03.453 --> 14:06.824
I want a man
who is unemployed,

14:06.924 --> 14:09.659
and went to a
community college.

14:09.760 --> 14:11.995
I am! And I did!

14:12.095 --> 14:14.164
And you know what really
turns me on?

14:14.264 --> 14:16.099
What?

14:16.199 --> 14:20.503
It's thinking about him in
his tighty-whiteys, sitting
at his computer

14:20.603 --> 14:23.540
and visiting different
porn sites, and taking

14:23.640 --> 14:27.677
the free tour, with no
intention of ever joining.

14:27.778 --> 14:28.979
I don't have a credit card!

14:29.847 --> 14:31.114
Kiss my chest.

14:31.214 --> 14:32.682
Okay.

14:34.084 --> 14:35.853
Harder!

14:35.953 --> 14:37.187
-Bite me!
-You sure?

14:37.287 --> 14:38.455
Harder! Bite me harder!

14:38.555 --> 14:40.824
(SCREAMING)

14:40.924 --> 14:43.961
-Get off of my titty,
you doped-up cracker!
-Huh?

14:46.463 --> 14:48.899
No more Spacecakes for you.

14:51.935 --> 14:56.373
Hey. I'm sorry about that,
T.J. I must have gotten
a contact buzz.

14:56.473 --> 14:58.641
What did I tell you
about making me look gay?

14:58.742 --> 15:00.543
Not 10 minutes go by,
and you got your sloppy mouth

15:00.643 --> 15:02.479
all over my breasteses.

15:02.579 --> 15:04.247
My nipple's ruined!

15:04.347 --> 15:06.249
You're lucky I was born
with a spare.

15:09.486 --> 15:11.588
There go one of my hos.

15:11.688 --> 15:13.891
The old guy in the
walker's one of your hos?

15:13.991 --> 15:17.394
Yeah. Why ain't his
ancient ass out there
makin' me my money?

15:17.494 --> 15:20.831
Kaiser! Get your old ass
back in the booth!

15:20.931 --> 15:23.500
Deucey, meet me back
at the float crib.

15:23.600 --> 15:26.804
Bitches out here
act like they never seen
a pimp before.

15:26.904 --> 15:30.373
I raise my hand, they look at
it like it's a goddamn
croissant.

15:30.473 --> 15:33.877
Then, bam! Feel my pimp hand.

15:36.914 --> 15:38.248
Where's the boat?

15:51.829 --> 15:53.430
(LAUGHING NERVOUSLY)
You scared me.

15:55.298 --> 15:59.202
Hey. Do you know who I am?
I am Heinz Hummer.

15:59.302 --> 16:02.172
I'm the gigolo
with the most below. Okay?

16:02.272 --> 16:05.042
I can give you a Filthy
Lopez like you never
had before.

16:05.142 --> 16:07.777
I could give you
a Cambodian Creamsicle

16:07.878 --> 16:10.080
that will make you scream
all night. Okay?

16:10.180 --> 16:14.017
But not now, 'cause I'm busy.
So leave me alone, bitch.

16:14.117 --> 16:18.055
Ugh! Wait a second.
Do I know you?

Man, are you wasted.

16:58.261 --> 16:59.897
I gotcha.

17:08.671 --> 17:10.307
Hey, hey, Heinz, wake up.
Check this out.

17:12.575 --> 17:13.542
Holy shit!

17:15.645 --> 17:19.382
Europe just got
a little better. Whoo!

17:19.482 --> 17:22.920
Damn. That old
Kaiser's got legs.

17:23.020 --> 17:24.887
You gotta keep
your bitches in line.

17:24.988 --> 17:26.489
Yeah.

17:26.589 --> 17:27.723
What's he doin' here?

17:27.824 --> 17:29.526
I found him passed out
in the alley.

17:29.626 --> 17:31.828
I couldn't just
leave him there.

17:31.929 --> 17:33.663
I put in a good word for ya.

17:33.763 --> 17:35.899
Thanks, Deucey.
Much appreciated.

17:36.733 --> 17:39.336
I knew you'd come around.

17:41.138 --> 17:44.274
Oh, shit.
Heinz ain't passed out.
Heinz is dead.

17:45.976 --> 17:48.278
No. He can't be.

17:49.112 --> 17:51.214
I'm tellin' you Heinz is dead.

17:51.314 --> 17:52.449
See for yourself!

17:58.288 --> 17:59.322
Watch this.

18:05.395 --> 18:06.563
Maybe he's just
a heavy sleeper.

18:13.803 --> 18:15.939
I can't believe you
brought a dead man-whore
in my home.

18:16.039 --> 18:17.207
What were you thinkin'?

18:17.307 --> 18:19.009
I didn't know
you could die from pot.

18:19.109 --> 18:21.044
This is no
pot-related fatality.

18:21.144 --> 18:22.712
This is no ganja accident.

18:22.812 --> 18:24.681
This man was murdered.

18:27.484 --> 18:29.186
The Man-whore Killer did this?

18:32.255 --> 18:34.457
-We gotta call the police.
-No, no, no! Hey, hey!

18:35.092 --> 18:36.459
Damn, white boy.

believe a stoned black pimp

18:38.962 --> 18:41.564

with a dead prosti-dude

I just wanna say,
for the record,
under T.J.'s management

18:57.147 --> 18:58.448
this would have never
happened.

what all the fuss was about.

God damn! No wonder
Delisha never came back.

sound right.

as Tiberius Jefferson Hicks.

Your loyalty
is impressive, sir.

20:18.095 --> 20:21.364
You've once been arrested
for man-whoring,
were you not?

20:21.464 --> 20:23.466
Look, I wasn't really
man-whoring...

20:23.566 --> 20:27.770
Please, Mr. Bigalow.
I've heard this
a thousand times.

20:27.870 --> 20:30.073
You were cold.
You were frightened.

20:30.173 --> 20:34.611
He took you under
his arm and fed you.
He made you feel sexy.

20:34.711 --> 20:38.014
He told you how to hide
money in every orifice.

20:38.115 --> 20:41.651
But your friend
is obviously a killer.

20:41.751 --> 20:43.986
T.J.'s not a killer.

20:44.087 --> 20:47.090
If he isn't a murderer,
then what was he doing

20:47.190 --> 20:49.826
checking out
a dead man's penis?

20:49.926 --> 20:54.931
I guess he was curious.
He heard it was big and juicy

20:55.031 --> 20:58.301
and wanted to see for himself.

20:58.401 --> 21:00.103
Lot of guys do that.

21:02.272 --> 21:04.474
No. They don't.

21:06.876 --> 21:08.245
Okay.

T.J.'s gay.

-Not normal gay, but,
ya know, crazy gay.

Musical theater gay.

21:22.892 --> 21:28.231
Is that why he puts
lipstick on all his victims?

21:30.500 --> 21:35.172
Wait a minute. In the alley,
I heard someone whistling.

21:36.173 --> 21:40.610
And I saw someone. A woman...

21:42.679 --> 21:44.781
...in a leopard coat.

21:46.082 --> 21:47.984
People see a lot
of crazy things

21:48.084 --> 21:50.086
when they're high
on spacecake.

21:50.187 --> 21:52.455
There's drugs in spacecake?

21:52.555 --> 21:56.593

your pimp whether
you help me or not.

How'd you find me?

22:06.068 --> 22:07.704
It's the only chicken
and waffles place in
all of Holland.

22:07.804 --> 22:10.873
So a black man's gotta
be at a chicken
and waffles place?

22:10.973 --> 22:13.142
That's racist.

22:13.243 --> 22:16.413
-But you are here.
-Yeah, but figuring it out
is racist.

22:18.915 --> 22:20.183
It's a nice place.

22:20.283 --> 22:22.552
Did you know Holland
invented chicken and waffles?

22:22.952 --> 22:24.554
Really?

22:24.654 --> 22:26.789
Before that you could only
get chicken or waffles,

22:26.889 --> 22:30.360
but they were the first
to put 'em together.

22:30.460 --> 22:32.395
Black people all over the
world would be forever

22:32.495 --> 22:34.264
grateful to the
Dutch for that.

22:34.364 --> 22:36.933
You do know the Dutch
started the slave trade.

22:37.033 --> 22:38.701
Those motherfuckers!

22:43.906 --> 22:46.843
What? Who let 'em print this?

22:49.078 --> 22:51.281
We're gonna prove
that you didn't kill anyone.

22:51.381 --> 22:52.915
I don't give
a damn about that.

22:53.015 --> 22:55.084
It's the "extremely gay"
part that's botherin' me.

22:55.184 --> 22:57.754
I mean, if I'm a murderer,
they'll welcome me home
with open arms.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.756
Get out of jail
and become a huge rapper.

22:59.856 --> 23:02.559
But a gay pimp?
Think where I'm goin'.
Vermont?

23:02.659 --> 23:06.463
Look, T.J., I think
I saw the real killer.

23:06.563 --> 23:07.630
It was a woman.

23:09.098 --> 23:11.100
Some She-John went
on a he-bitch killin' spree

23:11.200 --> 23:13.470
'cause she wasn't
satisfied with a Filthy Lopez.

23:13.570 --> 23:14.637
What's a Filthy Lopez?

23:14.737 --> 23:16.273

Look, all we got to do
is find the She-Johns
that went out with

the dead gigolos.
One of 'em is our killer.

23:20.510 --> 23:22.712
-Makes sense.
-You gotta get back
on the horse.

Horse? What horse?

23:24.046 --> 23:25.582
The man-whore horse.

little white ass as bait.

Bait? No, I'm not man-whoring.

when I was pleasurin' myself.

have to worry anymore
about her baby.

Even if I wanted to,

23:55.512 --> 23:58.047
how are we gonna find
a dead gigolo's customers?

23:58.147 --> 24:00.583
T.J.: We'll go to
the Man-whore Union.
But we gotta be careful.

with his tongue.

-That. That's Enzo.

He can actually kiss you
with his butthole.

words about our
fallen comrade,

24:40.122 --> 24:43.393
Chadsworth Buckingham.
Comes from a long line of hos.

grandmother
gave Henry VIII crabs.

would like to be
remembered for most

He was also
a supercilious cunt.

-Gian-Carlo.

the same price for

Until this insane killer
is apprehended,

25:31.808 --> 25:35.311
the union is going to
institute a new security
measure.

25:35.412 --> 25:39.048
This ring locks snugly
over your va-guy-na

25:39.148 --> 25:43.119

directly with a global

25:43.219 --> 25:47.824

Y'all know me.
My name is McManus.

25:52.729 --> 25:57.434
I joined this union
some 20-odd years ago
for two reasons.

25:57.534 --> 26:00.537
To have intercourse in
exchange for cash,

26:00.637 --> 26:03.372
and two, to protect my rights
as a man-whore.

26:03.773 --> 26:05.542
But

26:05.642 --> 26:11.714
three years ago, when this
union told we man-whores

26:11.814 --> 26:16.519
that we were to stop
having intercourse
with underage girls,

26:16.619 --> 26:21.390
I strongly disagreed.
But I did not stand up.

26:21.491 --> 26:24.894
I'm ashamed to say,
I stood down!

26:24.994 --> 26:30.767
And then three months later,
this union told we
man-whores

26:30.867 --> 26:36.172
that we were to begin
washin' our private areas
between customers.

26:36.272 --> 26:39.876

26:39.976 --> 26:44.080
And once again,
I'm ashamed to
report to you gentlemen,

26:44.180 --> 26:46.449

to tell my eight-year-old boy

26:51.821 --> 26:58.094

and he says, "Daddy.

Well, that depends.

-I'm in disguise.

-I'm in blackface.
-But you're black.

54:53.601 --> 54:57.938
-Yeah, but I'm disguised
as a different black guy.
-Well, you look the same.

We all look alike?
-No, that's not it.

anyone but the killer be
whistling that specific song?

I mean, the odds would
be astronomical.

01:03:30.951 --> 01:03:32.887
Maybe the song
got stuck in her head

01:03:32.987 --> 01:03:35.122
because she overheard
the real killer whistling it

01:03:35.222 --> 01:03:36.824
and maybe the real killer
is someone...

01:03:38.826 --> 01:03:41.896

though she doesn't realize.

01:03:43.497 --> 01:03:45.065

with the Great Pumpkin.

Now, what could she
possibly have against

01:04:07.521 --> 01:04:09.890
Maybe because
they represent a decline

01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:12.392

01:04:12.492 --> 01:04:14.361

all those weapons?

dangerous. You're not gonna
hurt her, are you?

be too careful.

this doorknob.

01:06:54.989 --> 01:06:57.958
-Where's Eva?
-Eva's gone to
the Man-whore Awards.

01:06:58.058 --> 01:07:00.227
-I'm going there too.
-I'm comin' with you.

01:07:01.328 --> 01:07:04.364
Yes. Yes,
you should be there too.

01:07:19.113 --> 01:07:21.615
Now, let me give you all
the lowdown on T.J.

01:07:21.715 --> 01:07:26.954
In Thailand, I got a job
in a carnival sideshow,
eatin' broken glass.

01:07:27.054 --> 01:07:30.991
We did six shows a day.
That's a lot of broken glass.

01:07:31.091 --> 01:07:33.260
And it's all collected
in the linin' of my anus.

01:07:34.995 --> 01:07:38.198
My ass is like one big,
nasty cheese grater.

01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:42.502
Here to perform
his signature move,

01:07:42.602 --> 01:07:47.942
the Chili Rainbow,
would you please welcome
Assapopulus Mariolis.

01:07:48.042 --> 01:07:49.276
(ALL CHEERING)

01:07:56.683 --> 01:07:57.851
Ah!

01:07:57.952 --> 01:08:01.255

01:08:12.432 --> 01:08:16.937
-EVA: Deuce! Deuce!
Right here!
-Hey, Eva's right behind us.

01:08:17.037 --> 01:08:18.404
EVA: Deuce, stop!

01:08:20.340 --> 01:08:21.908
What are you doin'?
She's right back there.

01:08:22.009 --> 01:08:25.979
-Deuce! He's the killer!
-What?

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:28.548
-You're with the killer!
-I'm with the dealer?

01:08:28.648 --> 01:08:31.417
-EVA: He's the
Man-whore Killer!
-Eighteen-wheeler?

01:08:32.551 --> 01:08:35.022
My uncle is the killer!

01:08:35.122 --> 01:08:38.058
Oh. I'm with the...
You're the...

01:08:38.158 --> 01:08:41.928
She says that I am the killer,
you stupido.

01:08:42.029 --> 01:08:45.165
-(TIRES SCREECHING)
-(EVA YELLING)

01:08:47.267 --> 01:08:49.803
But why? What did
man-whores ever do to you?

01:08:49.903 --> 01:08:52.939
What did they do to me? Ha!

01:08:53.040 --> 01:08:56.376
All my life, I dreamed of
being one thing. A gigolo.

01:08:56.475 --> 01:08:58.979
Yes, me. Gaspar Voorsboch.

01:09:00.447 --> 01:09:03.649
I'll never forget that day.
Never.

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:06.752
It was my first semester
at Man-whore University.

01:09:06.853 --> 01:09:13.160
Now, today, class, we shall
learn how to give a lady
a proper Portuguese Breakfast.

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:16.063
Ya take an egg,
and ya crack it.

01:09:16.162 --> 01:09:21.868
Ya mix 'em up.
Now, this is a good chance
to sweet-talk the client.

01:09:21.968 --> 01:09:24.770
-And?
-And we pour that in
there. Beautiful.

01:09:24.871 --> 01:09:27.774
-Very nice, now. And, uh...
-Don't forget
the Canadian bacon.

01:09:27.874 --> 01:09:29.876
EARL: The Canadian bacon,
of course. I was just gettin'
to that.

01:09:29.975 --> 01:09:32.246
-What are you doing?
-It's a penis enlarger.

01:09:32.345 --> 01:09:34.481
It says just a few pumps,
and it gets your thing bigger.

01:09:34.581 --> 01:09:36.582
You mind if I give myself
a few pumps?

01:09:36.683 --> 01:09:38.518
-Go nuts.
-There we go.

01:09:39.453 --> 01:09:40.554
So there ya have it.

01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:43.990
Tell me. How was your
Portuguese Breakfast?

01:09:44.091 --> 01:09:45.225
Delicious.

01:09:45.859 --> 01:09:47.294
-Elsa?
-Gaspar?

01:09:49.662 --> 01:09:50.663
(BURSTING SOUND)

01:09:51.465 --> 01:09:52.432
(LAUGHING)

01:09:55.235 --> 01:09:57.037
They knew she was my fiance.

01:09:57.137 --> 01:09:59.073
And tonight,
I will get my revenge.

01:10:06.680 --> 01:10:07.681
Leave it!

01:10:15.289 --> 01:10:16.690
(EVA YELLING)

01:10:19.759 --> 01:10:22.796
I'm from Canada
and I'm wasted!

01:10:25.031 --> 01:10:26.800
-Are you all right?
-Yeah. Are you okay?

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:30.237
Stop! Stop! Police business.

01:10:30.337 --> 01:10:32.106
-Come, we gotta stop him.
-Yeah.

01:10:33.507 --> 01:10:35.875
Stop! Stop!
Man-whore business.

01:10:35.975 --> 01:10:38.878
Before we present
the award for Man-whore
of the Year,

01:10:38.978 --> 01:10:41.481
let's take a moment
to honor those gigolos

01:10:41.581 --> 01:10:43.083
who have recently passed.

01:10:43.950 --> 01:10:45.452
(ALL CLAPPING)

01:10:47.287 --> 01:10:51.158
* Every rose has its thorn

01:10:53.293 --> 01:11:00.066
* Just like every cowboy
sings his sad, sad song

01:11:00.934 --> 01:11:02.469
* Every rose...

01:11:02.569 --> 01:11:04.438
Hey, Daddy. I was lookin'
in your underwear drawer

01:11:04.538 --> 01:11:06.306
and I found this bracelet.

01:11:07.674 --> 01:11:10.910
Holy mother of God.
That's not a bracelet, boy.

01:11:11.010 --> 01:11:14.314
That is a device that your
daddy has to wear on his he...

01:11:14.948 --> 01:11:18.352
His he... His he...

01:11:20.220 --> 01:11:23.157
-Happy birthday, son,
ya got a bracelet.
-Ha-ha. Great.

01:11:25.559 --> 01:11:28.628
-Let's go. Come on.
-JOHNNY: And now, the award
you've all been waiting for,

01:11:28.728 --> 01:11:30.364
the Man-whore of the Year.

01:11:30.464 --> 01:11:32.266
All right, listen.
You go get help.

01:11:32.366 --> 01:11:33.633
I'll get all the gigolos
off the stage.

01:11:33.733 --> 01:11:35.402
Okay. Good luck.

01:11:36.603 --> 01:11:38.004
Excuse me.

01:11:38.104 --> 01:11:40.374
You have to get off
the stage right now,
or you'll all be killed!

01:11:40.474 --> 01:11:42.976
Get the hell out of here,
douche, before I have you
thrown out.

01:11:43.076 --> 01:11:44.378
There's a bomb on the stage!

01:11:44.478 --> 01:11:48.815
-You idiot.
-You're all gonna die!

01:11:48.915 --> 01:11:51.985
I'm the Man-whore Killer!
This is a bomb!
Everybody out!

01:11:52.085 --> 01:11:53.520
-(ALL SCREAMING)
-Everybody get out!

01:11:54.654 --> 01:11:56.156
-You gotta get out of here!
-Ugh.

01:12:01.861 --> 01:12:04.664
You'll die with the rest
of them, Bigalow.

01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:10.370
Those gigolos robbed me
of my manhood.

01:12:10.470 --> 01:12:12.172
I was never able
to satisfy a woman.

01:12:12.272 --> 01:12:14.574
I'll see to it
that they won't, either.

01:12:19.813 --> 01:12:23.917
You don't have to kill anyone,
Gaspar. Because you can
please a woman.

01:12:25.619 --> 01:12:27.687
Those gigolos don't know
what they're talkin' about.

01:12:27.787 --> 01:12:29.189
Is he talking about us?

01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:38.265
Do you really think all
a woman wants is some guy
to give her a Mud Pretzel

01:12:38.365 --> 01:12:41.435
or a Turkish Snow Cone
or an Irish Facial?

01:12:42.769 --> 01:12:46.105
-Yes, they do, liar.
-WOMEN: No.

01:12:46.206 --> 01:12:49.643
A woman wants a guy
who'll ask her about her day
and really listen to her.

01:12:49.743 --> 01:12:51.578
Or at least pretend to.

01:12:51.678 --> 01:12:54.348
-Yes.
-What?

01:12:54.448 --> 01:13:00.420
When she's hurting,
ask her how she feels.
Cry with her.

01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.590
-CROWD: Yeah!
-These gigolos are
just ripping women off!

01:13:05.091 --> 01:13:07.594
I've never had any complaint
from any of those freaks!

01:13:10.930 --> 01:13:12.766
I faked it.

01:13:14.868 --> 01:13:17.404
A woman doesn't care
if you wear a Rolex watch

01:13:17.504 --> 01:13:20.274
or have a gigantic schlong
like Heinz Hummer.

01:13:21.074 --> 01:13:22.442
This guy knows his shit.

01:13:26.079 --> 01:13:27.547
What are you doing?

01:13:29.483 --> 01:13:30.884
Anyone else?

01:13:36.490 --> 01:13:38.292
If you let a woman really know
you care about her,

01:13:38.392 --> 01:13:39.993
maybe she'll give you
an Irish Facial.

01:13:50.370 --> 01:13:53.373
We will die together,
man-whore.

01:13:53.473 --> 01:13:54.908
(GASPING)

01:13:55.008 --> 01:13:56.410
You don't have to do this.

01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:59.613
-They ruined my life!
-Give me the detonator.

01:13:59.713 --> 01:14:00.714
No.

01:14:01.748 --> 01:14:03.450
My penis exploded.

01:14:04.984 --> 01:14:06.953
Okay, that's a tough one.
I'll give you that.

01:14:08.822 --> 01:14:12.392
But having a penis is way
overrated. Trust me.

01:14:14.661 --> 01:14:17.797
-No. No.
-Gaspar!

01:14:17.897 --> 01:14:18.932
Hmm?

01:14:25.071 --> 01:14:26.606
(CHEERING)

01:14:27.374 --> 01:14:28.675
Are you okay?

01:14:31.445 --> 01:14:32.679
We did it! Oh!

01:14:37.651 --> 01:14:39.018
ALL: Oh!

01:14:39.118 --> 01:14:40.086
That's the grossest thing

01:14:40.186 --> 01:14:41.488
I've ever seen.

01:14:41.588 --> 01:14:43.990
And I've seen some
pretty gross things.

01:14:44.090 --> 01:14:45.425
POLICEMAN: In the car.
Head down.

01:14:45.525 --> 01:14:48.628
I'll be seeing you again,
man-whore.

01:14:48.728 --> 01:14:51.297
CHADSWORTH: Deuce, you saved
the Man-whore Society.

01:14:53.032 --> 01:14:55.068
The Golden Boner
belongs to you.

01:14:55.168 --> 01:14:57.337
Thanks. I... That's very...

01:14:58.738 --> 01:14:59.706
This belongs to you too.

01:15:01.908 --> 01:15:03.042
Hang it to the left.

01:15:04.578 --> 01:15:06.212
You gonna eat that?

01:15:06.312 --> 01:15:07.981
-Knock yourself out.
-Thank you.

01:15:11.785 --> 01:15:14.988
So... I guess this means
you're a real gigolo now.

01:15:15.088 --> 01:15:16.923
I don't want you to treat me
any differently.

01:15:17.023 --> 01:15:19.626
How much would you
charge me for a kiss?

01:15:19.726 --> 01:15:21.428
Well, first one's always free.

01:15:25.031 --> 01:15:28.334
-Mmm. Deuce!
-What?

01:15:29.469 --> 01:15:31.070
Oh, no!

01:15:31.170 --> 01:15:32.706
No, it's, it's just this.

01:15:32.806 --> 01:15:34.441
* And that's the way I like it

01:15:36.042 --> 01:15:37.711
* My garden's a secret

01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:42.682
* And that's the way I like it

01:15:42.782 --> 01:15:49.122
* So please, baby, please

01:15:51.024 --> 01:15:53.427
* Open your heart

01:15:55.194 --> 01:15:58.097
Deucey! Whoo!
Thank you, Jesus.

01:15:59.633 --> 01:16:01.067
Did anybody hurt you in there?

01:16:02.436 --> 01:16:04.170
Oh, you askin' if I got
ass-punked.

01:16:04.270 --> 01:16:05.705
Is that's what's happenin'
right now?

01:16:05.805 --> 01:16:07.206
Not if you don't wanna
talk about it.

01:16:07.306 --> 01:16:10.343
Well, turns out,
I'm not that attractive.

01:16:10.444 --> 01:16:12.245
Well, you should know you've
been cleared of murder,

01:16:12.345 --> 01:16:13.680
but people still think
you're gay.

01:16:13.780 --> 01:16:16.249
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't tell nobody I'm not gay.

01:16:16.349 --> 01:16:20.420
Look at it:
T.J., the gay man's pimp.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.888
I mean, I'm gonna corner
the market, man.

01:16:21.988 --> 01:16:23.089
Check out my new bitches.

01:16:23.189 --> 01:16:24.424
-Hello, darling.
-Hi, sweetie.

01:16:24.524 --> 01:16:26.092
-Hi.
-MAN: Love you.

01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.028
Mmm-hmm.

01:16:29.128 --> 01:16:30.797
Let's get some chicken
and waffles. My treat.

01:16:30.897 --> 01:16:33.299
Oh. You sayin' the first thing
a brother wants when
he get out of prison

01:16:33.399 --> 01:16:34.701
-is chicken and waffles.
-DEUCE: Oh, come on.

01:16:34.801 --> 01:16:36.603
Hey, get your sheet cocks
back to work.

01:16:37.737 --> 01:16:40.707
* Step right up
and don't be shy

01:16:42.576 --> 01:16:46.112
* Because you will not
believe your eyes

01:16:46.212 --> 01:16:50.584
* She's right here
behind the glass

01:16:50.684 --> 01:16:54.554
* And you're gonna like her
'cause she's got class

01:16:56.055 --> 01:17:00.293
* You can look inside
another world

01:17:00.393 --> 01:17:04.698
* You get to talk
to a pretty girl

01:17:04.798 --> 01:17:08.434
* She's everything
you dream about

01:17:10.637 --> 01:17:13.106
* But don't fall in love

01:17:14.273 --> 01:17:15.742
* She's a beauty

01:17:15.842 --> 01:17:18.678
* She's one in a million girls

01:17:18.778 --> 01:17:21.180
* She's a beauty

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:25.752
* Why would I lie?

01:17:25.852 --> 01:17:27.721
* Why would I lie?

01:17:27.821 --> 01:17:29.856
* But don't fall in love

01:17:31.658 --> 01:17:33.259
* She's a beauty

01:17:33.359 --> 01:17:35.461
* She's one in a million girls

01:17:36.095 --> 01:17:38.632
* She's a beauty

01:17:38.732 --> 01:17:39.999
* Why would I lie?

01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:48.642
* One, two, three, four!

01:17:54.748 --> 01:17:57.050
* I said no, no, never

01:17:57.150 --> 01:18:00.286
* We don't go together

01:18:00.386 --> 01:18:03.757
* Oh, I really couldn't
take anymore

01:18:06.225 --> 01:18:09.028
* Now, it's two weeks later

01:18:09.128 --> 01:18:11.631
* I feel such a traitor

01:18:11.731 --> 01:18:15.635
* Oh, I let you
in my back door

01:18:18.104 --> 01:18:21.140
* You're the one
who's creepin'

01:18:21.240 --> 01:18:23.610
* Rough love's so deceivin'

01:19:02.181 --> 01:19:06.820

but I don't get too far *

01:19:40.153 --> 01:19:45.959

who's creeping

01:20:07.747 --> 01:20:10.149
