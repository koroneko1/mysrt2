00:01:27.608 --> 00:01:28.533
How long have  you been wai ting?

00:01:28.533 --> 00:01:31.069
I just got here.

00:01:41.113 --> 00:01:43.504
Such an expatriate. You're so gentle!

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.623
I'm a Vietnamese.

00:01:45.623 --> 00:01:47.620
Being gentle is in my blood.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.524
How do you feel about this return?

00:01:49.524 --> 00:01:50.753
Are there many changes?

00:01:51.736 --> 00:01:54.500
It's been 6 years. Many things have changed.

00:01:55.268 --> 00:01:57.035
I'm the biggest change, ain't I?

00:01:58.018 --> 00:02:00.001
You're the woman of the family now.

00:02:03.994 --> 00:02:05.263
Here's your drinks.

00:02:06.338 --> 00:02:07.539
- Thank you.
- Yes.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.268
Hey.

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.356
Hold on.

00:02:17.356 --> 00:02:18.457
Yes?

00:02:23.003 --> 00:02:24.662
Your shirt's dirty.

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:27.488
Thank you, sir.

00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:32.736
I don't like untidy things.

00:02:33.197 --> 00:02:35.527
I know you.

00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:38.206
Why are you here so early today?

00:02:38.697 --> 00:02:40.886
I shouldn't have come to work!

00:02:47.643 --> 00:02:49.216
My brother's back.

00:02:49.646 --> 00:02:52.205
Don't mention me.

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:55.728
It depends on whether he can realize you.

00:02:56.465 --> 00:02:57.567
Bye.

00:03:00.362 --> 00:03:02.175
Let's drink.

00:03:02.796 --> 00:03:04.185
Thank you.

00:03:07.164 --> 00:03:08.042
Brother!

00:03:09.132 --> 00:03:10.099
How are you?

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:13.166
I'm good.

00:03:15.285 --> 00:03:18.422
Oh, my dear son!

00:03:18.422 --> 00:03:21.170
You're acting like you really love him!

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.296
Huh?

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:24.861
Am I not allowed to love my son?

00:03:24.861 --> 00:03:28.088
Stop drinking and then you can. Okay?

00:03:33.094 --> 00:03:34.985
Who would drink coffee at night?

00:03:35.323 --> 00:03:37.585
We can find a pub and have some drinks!

00:03:37.585 --> 00:03:41.918
Hey! You are not allowed to drink!

00:03:44.068 --> 00:03:45.326
No!

00:03:45.602 --> 00:03:46.690
Just one bottle!

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.193
No means no!

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.980
Thach's just got back so he can drink.

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.964
But you, no!

00:03:52.855 --> 00:03:55.090
Brother. Don't let him drink alcohol!

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.094
Uhm. I got it.

00:04:35.027 --> 00:04:36.712
The beers taste so good today.

00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:41.227
I heard you're addicted to beers.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.420
I didn't see you drink before.

00:04:44.157 --> 00:04:45.573
Since I got married,

00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:48.329
there have been so many pressures.

00:04:52.936 --> 00:04:54.202
Don't drink much.

00:04:58.441 --> 00:05:00.000
I drink these to refresh my thirst.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.944
If only I could have had enough money

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.501
to have you treated abroad.

00:05:13.572 --> 00:05:15.005
I couldn't do anything back then.

00:05:15.005 --> 00:05:17.746
It was still better to use the money on the restaurant.

00:05:32.458 --> 00:05:32.958
Hey, Duy.

00:05:32.958 --> 00:05:33.503
Yes?

00:05:41.028 --> 00:05:42.187
Let's go back.

00:05:44.368 --> 00:05:45.293
Okay, bro.

00:05:49.439 --> 00:05:51.176
Let me clean this up first.

00:06:16.424 --> 00:06:17.763
Can I sit here for a while?

00:06:18.654 --> 00:06:19.947
You're back?

00:06:21.114 --> 00:06:22.582
Make yourself comfortable.

00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:29.271
What time do you close?

00:06:30.438 --> 00:06:32.090
Just sit and relax.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:33.871
We're closed at 11:00 P.M.

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:43.656
Grab me a beer, the type which we had the other day.

00:06:43.656 --> 00:06:45.578
Okay. Got it!

00:06:46.592 --> 00:06:48.307
You had beers?

00:06:50.733 --> 00:06:52.275
Why did you tell me that you quit it?

00:06:52.275 --> 00:06:53.569
I only had one bottle!

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:54.839
It still means you had it!

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:56.095
Come here! With me!

00:06:56.095 --> 00:06:57.497
Ahh! I'm sorry!

00:06:57.497 --> 00:06:58.821
 Why did you tell me you quit?

00:06:58.821 --> 00:07:01.037
Obviously, you told me so! Now you...

00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:01.537
Come here! Right here!

00:07:01.537 --> 00:07:03.961
I won't do it again! I won't!

00:07:13.268 --> 00:07:14.395
Hey, you.

00:07:15.961 --> 00:07:17.372
What time do you close?

00:07:17.372 --> 00:07:18.331
Uh...

00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:20.222
11 P.M.

00:07:23.201 --> 00:07:24.914
It's only 10:20 A.M.Give me a beer.

00:07:26.603 --> 00:07:27.300
Give me a beer.

00:07:27.576 --> 00:07:28.968
Yes.

00:07:34.589 --> 00:07:36.258
Do we know each other?

00:07:39.176 --> 00:07:41.767
I've worked at many places. Maybe you're mistaking.

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:45.856
- Your voice...
- Maybe you have ever heard it at a coffee shop!

00:07:48.313 --> 00:07:50.032
We don't know each other?

00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:52.227
I was blind.

00:07:54.531 --> 00:07:57.553
You're unfamiliar to me, sir.

00:08:02.068 --> 00:08:03.922
If there's nothing else, I need to go.

00:09:14.259 --> 00:09:16.417
Phuc! Someone's calling you!

00:09:16.417 --> 00:09:17.547
Yep!

00:09:17.823 --> 00:09:21.274
I'm drying clothes, so pick up the phone for me!

00:09:28.431 --> 00:09:32.284
What's up, dear? How are you and the guy with the cute scar?

00:09:32.284 --> 00:09:33.590
Hello!

00:09:34.696 --> 00:09:35.778
Oops... You're not Phuc?

00:09:35.778 --> 00:09:36.725
Uhm!

00:09:36.725 --> 00:09:38.622
He's busy, so he asked me to pick this up.

00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:40.912
Ah! Phuc is here!

00:09:44.567 --> 00:09:46.193
Hello! It's me!

00:09:46.193 --> 00:09:48.375
Heyyy... Who did you let answer my call?

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:00.696
Hello, I'm listening.

00:10:00.696 --> 00:10:02.629
 do you call me?

00:10:04.288 --> 00:10:07.284
Oh! I want to ask you to buy some personal stuff.

00:10:07.622 --> 00:10:09.321
The things at home were all expired.

00:10:09.321 --> 00:10:11.833
 I just take care of the house

00:10:11.833 --> 00:10:13.987
 The things at home i doesn't dare to throw it away

00:10:13.987 --> 00:10:17.239
Yes, "ma'am". I got it.

00:10:18.222 --> 00:10:18.826
But, hey.

00:10:18.826 --> 00:10:19.380
 yes

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.522
Can you help me find a helper?

00:10:21.522 --> 00:10:23.122
 still the same request?

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.336
 Let me handle this. The most person!

00:10:26.336 --> 00:10:27.916
You know my requirements.

00:10:43.366 --> 00:10:44.317
Thank you.

00:10:49.784 --> 00:10:51.672
Let me find a helper for you!

00:10:53.453 --> 00:10:55.212
Um. Please do.

00:11:01.355 --> 00:11:04.124
My secretary said you booked a flight.

00:11:07.042 --> 00:11:08.659
I'll come to the USA next week.

00:11:09.304 --> 00:11:11.281
But you just got back yesterday!

00:11:14.875 --> 00:11:16.819
Why don't you move back here for a long stay?

00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:22.767
I don't think this place is for me anymore.

00:11:28.449 --> 00:11:30.145
Let's eat.

00:11:36.442 --> 00:11:38.801
Let me help you find Phuc.

00:11:42.671 --> 00:11:43.567
Who's Phuc?

00:11:43.936 --> 00:11:44.961
Yes?

00:11:45.913 --> 00:11:47.820
I don't remember him.

00:11:49.417 --> 00:11:51.156
All those vague memories

00:11:52.016 --> 00:11:53.254
should be out of my mind.

00:11:55.496 --> 00:11:56.583
The vaguer

00:11:57.965 --> 00:11:58.855
or duller they are,

00:12:00.268 --> 00:12:01.712
the easier it is for me to forget.

00:12:06.381 --> 00:12:07.854
Just let them vanish.

00:12:22.352 --> 00:12:23.794
These are all my favorite dishes!

00:13:14.688 --> 00:13:16.145
Has it been 6 years?

00:13:19.708 --> 00:13:21.066
I thought...

00:13:22.141 --> 00:13:24.068
I could forget you.

00:13:28.583 --> 00:13:31.278
At least you should have left a thing for me

00:13:31.554 --> 00:13:34.377
so that I could live a life without you.

00:13:52.498 --> 00:13:54.197
There was nothing.

00:14:13.639 --> 00:14:15.315
Should I tell Thach?

00:14:15.315 --> 00:14:16.605
Please don't.

00:14:18.356 --> 00:14:19.708
It's been 6 years.

00:14:20.537 --> 00:14:22.472
If you can't be lovers, then be friends.

00:14:27.693 --> 00:14:30.932
I think I shouldn't see him again.

00:14:33.573 --> 00:14:36.205
It's okay. I should work now.

00:14:48.553 --> 00:14:50.828
I thought you were the most stubborn one!

00:14:51.564 --> 00:14:55.589
Don't mention what's in the past. I feel so bad about it.

00:14:59.552 --> 00:15:02.143
Thach asked me to find a helper for him.

00:15:02.788 --> 00:15:04.556
Should we trick Phuc to do it?

00:15:06.153 --> 00:15:08.660
Then, we must make sure they don't know.

00:15:10.042 --> 00:15:11.318
Just capture him,

00:15:11.564 --> 00:15:13.925
carry him in our arms and throw him into Thach's house.

00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:16.855
Who will carry him? Will you?

00:15:16.855 --> 00:15:18.484
Just do it! Carry him!

00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:23.465
I'm so good at carrying you to our bed,

00:15:23.465 --> 00:15:25.775
but it'd take me more time to carry someone else.

00:15:26.205 --> 00:15:27.518
We're in public!

00:15:33.323 --> 00:15:35.079
Hello!

00:15:35.386 --> 00:15:36.694
Are you Quyen Anh?

00:15:36.694 --> 00:15:38.096
Yes, I am!

00:15:42.212 --> 00:15:44.546
Okay. You can start today.

00:15:45.283 --> 00:15:46.101
Huh?

00:15:46.470 --> 00:15:48.295
Start today?

00:15:49.063 --> 00:15:50.545
Is there any problem?

00:15:51.896 --> 00:15:53.336
Uh...

00:15:53.643 --> 00:15:55.462
Um, I...

00:15:56.537 --> 00:15:58.637
This is Thach, the house owner.

00:15:58.637 --> 00:15:59.689
Mr. Thach!

00:15:59.689 --> 00:16:02.218
You look so "yummy" with white skin!

00:16:03.262 --> 00:16:06.375
You have a light skin! Yummy!

00:16:10.276 --> 00:16:12.264
You can clean every corner,

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:14.157
except for my room.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.836
Ma'am! Mr. Thach looks difficult!

00:16:21.174 --> 00:16:23.796
You want to bail out even before starting?

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.591
I don't! Gosh!

00:16:25.591 --> 00:16:26.868
You don't know me!

00:16:26.868 --> 00:16:29.711
You must leave strict people like him to me!

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.819
Ma'am. The other day I watched a Korean movie.

00:16:32.819 --> 00:16:36.352
The boss and the helper,

00:16:36.843 --> 00:16:40.750
gosh, these two, they were... similar like this!

00:16:40.750 --> 00:16:43.046
I only watched to the middle and my mom turned it off!

00:16:43.046 --> 00:16:45.223
Now, I want to experience it here.

00:16:45.223 --> 00:16:46.852
Please allow me!

00:16:47.129 --> 00:16:50.577
Focus on your work, miss! Less time for movies or you'll get fired.

00:16:51.191 --> 00:16:52.676
Yes, yes, yes! I'll work now!

00:16:52.676 --> 00:16:56.318
Mr. Thach! Mr. Thach!

00:17:50.098 --> 00:17:51.923
Change all of the locks!

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:54.577
Yes.

00:17:54.823 --> 00:17:56.334
Also the gate's lock,

00:17:56.580 --> 00:17:57.605
don't forget it!

00:17:57.605 --> 00:17:58.317
Yes.

00:17:59.177 --> 00:18:01.399
At 5:00 PM precisely, I will take a shower.

00:18:01.737 --> 00:18:03.017
Don't be late!

00:18:03.171 --> 00:18:04.563
I don't like that.

00:18:12.365 --> 00:18:17.451
 

00:18:17.727 --> 00:18:19.509
I was waiting for you.

00:18:25.498 --> 00:18:26.595
Mr. Thach?

00:18:26.595 --> 00:18:27.956
Why don't you rest in your room?

00:18:27.956 --> 00:18:30.100
You're roaming as if you're sleepwalking!

00:18:31.144 --> 00:18:33.620
Huh? Why do you look so sad?

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:35.310
What's happened? Tell me!

00:18:37.245 --> 00:18:38.185
You can't say it?

00:18:38.646 --> 00:18:39.694
Then, you can text me!

00:18:39.694 --> 00:18:42.160
I've been waiting for a text all day!

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.288
Remember to text me!

00:18:43.288 --> 00:18:44.471
Tell me about it!

00:18:44.471 --> 00:18:48.968
Will you?

00:20:08.265 --> 00:20:09.593
I told you to be gentle.

00:20:10.207 --> 00:20:12.229
Yes. Can I do this again?

00:20:12.229 --> 00:20:12.966
No need.

00:20:14.410 --> 00:20:17.786
Yes... so... Can I leave?

00:20:17.786 --> 00:20:18.735
Go.

00:20:18.735 --> 00:20:19.311
Yes.

00:20:20.877 --> 00:20:21.523
Wait.

You can't even do the cooking!

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:35.018
If you can't, just quit!

00:20:39.164 --> 00:20:40.174
Sir!

00:20:40.635 --> 00:20:41.443
What?

Do you know my name?

00:20:45.737 --> 00:20:46.715
I don't.

00:20:47.667 --> 00:20:49.618
My father is Vo Hoang Quan.

00:20:49.772 --> 00:20:53.724
He named me Vo Thuy Quyen Anh. (Quyen Anh = boxing)

00:20:54.615 --> 00:20:57.754
You know how our names reflect us.

Do I have to clean them up myself?

00:22:21.524 --> 00:22:23.200
I can't clean my own mess!

00:22:26.425 --> 00:22:28.079
Why hasn't Nu called me yet?

I have rules that I must follow.

00:22:45.734 --> 00:22:49.473
 Yep! So live alone, play alone with this rules

00:22:50.087 --> 00:22:53.531

Okay? Help me with this.

 He will come at 8:00 tomorrow

00:23:07.491 --> 00:23:09.574
Um. Tell him to be punctual.

00:23:54.264 --> 00:23:55.143
