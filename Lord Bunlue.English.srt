[ducks quacking]

3
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,291
Do we have any other petitions?

4
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,583
Yes, sir.

5
00:00:51,666 --> 00:00:53,041
About what?

6
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:55,083
I would like to propose

7
00:00:55,166 --> 00:00:57,416
the extension
of the slaves' retirement age,

8
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,583
sir.

9
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:03,000
Why extend it, Luang Sorachak?
It's already long enough.

10
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:07,125
Khun Bun Lue, please be sympathetic.

11
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,583
It's those slaves who deserve sympathy.

12
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,541
-Khun Bun Lue!
-All right. Enough now.

13
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:14,916
I agree with Khun Bun Lue on this matter.

14
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,583
Let's call it a day.

15
00:01:18,666 --> 00:01:22,375
I'll have to meet the French ambassador
in the afternoon.

16
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,250
[sighing]

17
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:27,375
-Khun Bun Lue, please follow me.
-Yes, sir.

18
00:01:30,041 --> 00:01:33,375
Siam must sign the treaty, giving up
lands on the left bank of the Mekong,

19
00:01:33,458 --> 00:01:36,291
opposite Louangphrabang,
and to the south of them.

20
00:01:36,375 --> 00:01:39,708
They are still not happy.
They are pushing us harder.

21
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,083
What do these French people want?

22
00:01:42,166 --> 00:01:45,125
Give them an inch,
and they'll take a mile.

23
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,916
How indignant.

24
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,333
We'll have to negotiate with them
to lose as few territories as possible.

25
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,833
Oh, right, Khun Bun Lue.

26
00:01:53,916 --> 00:01:56,750
Since I'll be busy all of next month
meeting the French,

27
00:01:56,833 --> 00:02:01,250
I would like you
to run an errand for me in Chiang Rai.

28
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:04,000
You are familiar with the place, right?

29
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,708
-[chuckles softly] You go there regularly.
-Not regularly.

30
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:12,708
[chuckles softly] I know you do.

31
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:19,333
[panting]

32
00:02:27,666 --> 00:02:29,666
-Sin, stop.
-Yes, sir.

33
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,625
[tram's bells chiming]

34
00:02:34,041 --> 00:02:36,583
-I'll be back shortly.
-Yes, sir.

35
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:40,875
Ouch!

36
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:44,041
My calves are all swollen.

37
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:53,750
Your betel nut is here.

38
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,250
Thank you, Sonklin.

39
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,166
Oh!

40
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,916
-Spittoon.
-Yes, ma'am.

41
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,375
Keep making that face,
and I will spit it in your face.

42
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,166
Give me a massage.

43
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:23,000
Ek, what are you holding?

44
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,791
A package sent from Chiang Rai
for Master Khun.

45
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,708
[clanging]

46
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,333
Mod, what's wrong with you?

47
00:03:31,416 --> 00:03:33,166
Suddenly lost your strength?

48
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,000
How careless!

49
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,958
I'm sorry.

50
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,333
You've ruined my stuff.

51
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,083
Ek, take it away.

52
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,916
Let Bun Lue open it himself.

53
00:03:44,583 --> 00:03:46,208
Come back, you idiot.

54
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,250
Clumsy fool!

55
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:49,208
Breaking everything you touch.

56
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:52,125
You should be taught a lesson by caning.

57
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,166
You're crossing the line.

58
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:55,250
Yes, ma'am. She's crossing the line.

59
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:57,208
I mean you.

60
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,166
-Massage me!
-Yes, ma'am.

61
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,250
Just you wait.

62
00:04:04,875 --> 00:04:06,125
Ow, ow!

63
00:04:06,375 --> 00:04:08,291
Are you trying to break my joint?

64
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,708
Isn't it beautiful?

65
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,250
Mmm.

66
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,833
Soybean, rice steamed in banana leaf.

67
00:04:21,166 --> 00:04:22,708
Soybean, rice steamed in banana leaf.

68
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,666
Sin, let's go.

69
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:27,208
You have a car, why not use it?

70
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,166
I prefer a rickshaw.

71
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,375
Don't you at least feel for me?

72
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:33,708
-How exhausting can it be?
-Why don't you try?

73
00:04:36,416 --> 00:04:37,666
[panting]

74
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,375
See?

75
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:51,958
I'm not even exhausted.

76
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,416
[laughing]

77
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,250
I'm so lucky.

78
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:01,666
What an idiot!

79
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,541
Why? What are you looking at?

80
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:06,791
Looking for a fight with me?

81
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:08,500
Just you wait.

82
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,791
Want to fight with me?

83
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:12,208
Do I look like your master?

84
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:13,708
[dog whimpering]

85
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:16,083
What the hell are you doing, Mod?

86
00:05:16,166 --> 00:05:17,583
He stole the food in the kitchen.

87
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,750
He was hungry.
Don't you eat when you're hungry?

88
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:23,458
Of course I do.
But you are spoiling your dog.

89
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,916
You don't listen to me.

90
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:28,000
I cannot say anything.
You only take the dog's side.

91
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,625
What's wrong with her?

92
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,458
Is it menopause?

93
00:05:34,791 --> 00:05:36,875
Guess she has too much time
to fight with a dog.

94
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,625
Damn!

95
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,958
Daddy is here, Silver. Come here.

96
00:05:43,291 --> 00:05:46,666
Wow. A photo taken with Khun Thepmala.

97
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,791
He sent this from Chiang Rai.

98
00:05:49,291 --> 00:05:50,875
Who's this lady standing next to you?

99
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,875
She looks beautiful. Is she...

100
00:06:00,083 --> 00:06:01,000
Right?

101
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,333
Of course, she is.

102
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,750
Are you shy because I hit a sore spot?

103
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:11,458
Women in Chiang Rai are so beautiful.

104
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:14,000
-Don't you agree, Mod?
-Yeah.

105
00:06:17,916 --> 00:06:19,291
What's going on with her?

106
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:21,083
[chuckles softly]

107
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,500
Bun Lue is shy. Isn't that cute?

108
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:24,583
Yes, ma'am.

109
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:25,875
[chuckles softly]

110
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,916
-Sin.
-Yes?

111
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,333
Come here.

112
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,958
What can I do for you?

113
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,750
Come closer.

114
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:43,833
Did you stick your head in a bush?

115
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:46,125
You've got leaves in your hair.

116
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,708
Next time...

117
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:53,875
be more careful.

118
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,833
Yes, ma'am.

119
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:04,750
Do you...

120
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,250
like him?

121
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:14,375
Of course, you do!

122
00:07:14,458 --> 00:07:15,666
Don't be shy!

123
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,791
I really hit your sore spot.

124
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,666
Are you shy now?

125
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm sure she likes him.

126
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,791
-[dog barking]
-Come here. Eat your food.

127
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:28,583
This way. Eat. Come on.

128
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:31,416
Hurry up and feed him.

129
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,000
-Yes, sir.
-Come, come, Silver.

130
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:36,333
-My baby.
-Silver.

131
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,500
-Eat your meal now.
-Silver.

132
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,083
Aren't you hungry?
Come on, Silver. Eat!

133
00:07:41,166 --> 00:07:42,750
You eat it, then.

134
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:43,958
I was joking.

135
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:45,583
-Yes, sir.
-You're funny.

136
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,791
Come here.

137
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,833
Eat now.

138
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:51,375
Yes, eat.

139
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:55,708
Don't be mad at Mod.
She just has a foul mouth.

140
00:07:55,791 --> 00:07:57,333
-Give him more.
-Yes, sir.

141
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,750
-You want to eat it yourself?
-No, sir.

142
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,458
Where the hell is Mod?

143
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:04,000
Has she fed Goldie yet?

144
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,291
I think so, sir.

145
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,541
Go check it out. Leave this here.

146
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:11,416
Here you are.

147
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,583
Instead of doing my chores,
I have to take care of you.

148
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:16,166
Here. Come on.

149
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:17,625
One is not enough.

150
00:08:17,708 --> 00:08:19,500
Eat a lot to satisfy your daddy.

151
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,000
Four pieces.

152
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,458
Are you full? Here. Eat another one.

153
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:25,833
How boring!

154
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:27,625
She's more well-fed than I am.

155
00:08:28,916 --> 00:08:30,875
Juicy chicken breast.

156
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,250
I only got the feet.

157
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,333
What's wrong with that woman?

158
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,291
She's been moody all day.

159
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,875
This is why her husband got tired of her.
Who would want a wife like that?

160
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,875
If no one wants her, can I have her?

161
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,250
Take care of Silver and Goldie
while I am away.

162
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,500
Yes, sir. Where will you go?

163
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,583
Chiang Rai, Mother.

164
00:08:58,125 --> 00:08:59,583
How long will you stay there?

165
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,375
Probably many days.

166
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,291
That's great. On the way back,

167
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,958
don't forget to buy me some durians.

168
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:09,125
I'm going to Chiang Rai,

00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,291
He took all the money in one try.

334
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,333
-I'm broke.
-I told you, Sin.

335
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,333
If you don't pay me back, I'll tell Mod.

336
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:22,083
Last time we met, you weren't
a grown man yet, Keerati.

337
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,583
Yes.

338
00:18:23,666 --> 00:18:25,166
How long ago did you graduate
from medical school?

339
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,458
Two years ago, sir.

340
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:27,791
I see.

341
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:28,958
How's your father?

342
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,375
He's suffering from hemorrhoids.

343
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,208
-And your mother?
-She scalded her head,

344
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,916
but she's better now.

345
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:42,666
Ten years, 20 years, time flies.

346
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:48,541
I remember you running around
the house, naked.

347
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,583
[sighing]

348
00:18:50,666 --> 00:18:52,250
I guess I'm old now.

349
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,083
Hmm.

350
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,541
-Why don't you just eat her up?
-Yes.

351
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:05,250
I wish I could.

352
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,083
Go, go.

353
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:12,583
You're so good at flirting, aren't you?

354
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,083
Keerati, Keerati.

355
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:22,083
-Keerati!
-Yes?

356
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,458
-Are you going to diagnose me?
-Yes, I can.

357
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,875
Let's go.

358
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:28,375
-Watch the tray.
-Yes.

359
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,125
[clanking]

360
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,750
I told you!

361
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,166
I'm not picking it up.

362
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,375
Why are you so happy today?

363
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,708
I'm proud to have poor taste.

364
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,375
Are you?

365
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:42,583
-Iang.
-Yes?

366
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,750
Be careful. Don't break anything.
They are expensive.

367
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,708
Once you finish those, come help me here.

368
00:19:46,791 --> 00:19:47,625
-All right.
-Hey.

369
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:48,875
-Plarn, you're here.
-Yes?

370
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:51,500
Move the bottle to the left.

371
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:53,583
And don't break anything.

372
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,041
Mom.

373
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,583
Who's my father?

374
00:20:02,208 --> 00:20:04,750
Your father is a man.

375
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,625
But he doesn't love his family.

376
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,458
Now I'm getting cranky.

377
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,250
[sighs]

378
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,041
I'm tongue-tied.

379
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,125
[sighs]

380
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:27,750
Perhaps Sin is my dad?

381
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,416
What?

382
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,000
Plarn, you're foul-mouthed!
Our father cannot be that ugly.

383
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,250
Oh, come on.

384
00:20:43,875 --> 00:20:45,458
What's wrong with me?

385
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:48,208
You have a fungal infection
on the groin.

386
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:50,125
It's called tinea cruris.

387
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:53,500
Or simply jock itch.

388
00:20:53,583 --> 00:20:55,375
What is jock itch?

389
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,500
Groin rash.

390
00:20:57,291 --> 00:20:58,125
I see.

391
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:01,083
I will leave the antifungal cream
with Sin.

392
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:02,416
Thank you so much, Keerati.

393
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,708
I'll take my leave now.

394
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,416
This disease is not easy to get.

395
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,291
You must be exceptionally dirty.

396
00:21:16,541 --> 00:21:18,208
How disgusting.

397
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,875
-Let's get wasted tonight after work.
-Sure, Luang.

398
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:28,375
How is it?

399
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:31,750
Wow.

400
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,541
This is awesome, Bun Lue.

401
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:37,916
It's nothing special.

402
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,500
I just want the slaves to have
additional income.

403
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,791
So one day they can pay off
their debt bondage.

404
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:45,750
Oh, my.

405
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,958
You're so generous.

406
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,250
I guess I will have to use
some of your ideas.

407
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:56,500
Go ahead.

408
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,000
I will need your help.

409
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:02,083
This is superb.

410
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,083
Buy two get one free.

411
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:05,583
Step right up, folks.

412
00:22:05,666 --> 00:22:08,916
Newly fermented, a new recipe
from Khun Bun Lue.

413
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,666
What glowing skin!
This drink is for ladies, too.

414
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,750
Once you drink this,

415
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,291
your adrenaline will pimp like a piston.

416
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:17,541
"Pump" not pimp.

417
00:22:17,625 --> 00:22:18,708
[laughing gently]

418
00:22:18,791 --> 00:22:20,333
What is it, anyway?

419
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:23,541
It's called Stomping Tiger.

420
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,708
What about this one?

421
00:22:26,083 --> 00:22:27,625
This one is called

422
00:22:27,708 --> 00:22:29,458
Dog Stomping Cat.

423
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:30,625
And this one?

424
00:22:32,541 --> 00:22:35,375
This one is "I will stomp you."
Stop asking!

425
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,041
But you can ask me anything.

426
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,541
[chuckles softly]

427
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,500
Actually, I know all the rest.

428
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:43,333
And you are...

429
00:22:44,041 --> 00:22:46,166
-You are...
-I'm Tharin.

430
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:52,875

[chuckles nervously]

442
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,416
[chuckles] Plarn is such a player,
just like his father.

443
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,083
Like father like son.

00:23:48,625 --> 00:23:51,541
I told you not to sing that kind of song.

446
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,166
Don't let me hear it again.

447
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,208
Come on, Bun Lue.

448
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:58,375
They probably just want to have fun.

449
00:23:59,875 --> 00:24:00,958
Let's go.

450
00:24:02,791 --> 00:24:04,750
Oh, my.

451
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:11,416
Your face is as long as my foot.

452
00:24:13,291 --> 00:24:15,875
-What's your name?
-Bunleng, sir.

453
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:19,000
Are you related to Bun Lue?

454
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,416
I'm his servant.

455
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,000
Yeah.

456
00:24:22,375 --> 00:24:24,291
You look the part.

457
00:24:25,125 --> 00:24:26,791
If I saw you through the window,

458
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:29,166
I'd definitely think
it was someone's foot.

459
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:35,500
One, two, three.

460
00:24:38,041 --> 00:24:40,416
That's it.

461
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,375
May I?

462
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,208
Oh...

463
00:24:49,291 --> 00:24:51,875
Sure, the toilet is over there.

464
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:52,958
[sighs]

465
00:24:53,041 --> 00:24:54,708
No, I mean the photograph.

466
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
I see.

467
00:24:56,583 --> 00:24:57,875
Let's take a photo together.

468
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:01,375
Then who will press the shutter?

469
00:25:02,958 --> 00:25:04,333
Just kidding.

470
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:07,833
Please.

471
00:25:19,083 --> 00:25:21,791
Let me arrange your shirt.

472
00:25:23,958 --> 00:25:26,583
If only someone cared about me this much

473
00:25:26,666 --> 00:25:29,416
and helped arrange my shirt
like this everyday,

474
00:25:30,083 --> 00:25:31,875
that would be great.

475
00:25:39,208 --> 00:25:40,541
Soi.

476
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,291
I have to take a photo now.

477
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:49,333
[Bun Lue] This place
also has many customers.

478
00:25:51,958 --> 00:25:53,083
[laughing]

479
00:25:54,625 --> 00:25:55,500
Not bad.

480
00:25:56,125 --> 00:25:58,875
It's one of the most popular shops
in town.

481
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,083
Yeah.

482
00:26:00,166 --> 00:26:01,375
I believe it.

483
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,875
[chuckles softly]

484
00:26:04,541 --> 00:26:07,375
[Bun Lue] This is Mod who is in charge
of this shop.

485
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:10,291
She looks decent.

486
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:13,666
I'm sure she was pretty
when she was young.

487
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,916
Indeed. She was the prettiest.

488
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,500
But heavy drinking led to weight gain.

489
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:24,458
Hey. You'd better take good care
of your body.

490
00:26:24,625 --> 00:26:26,583
Or else your husband will find a mistress.

491
00:26:26,666 --> 00:26:27,750
It's too late, sir.

492
00:26:28,291 --> 00:26:29,291
Oh.

493
00:26:30,125 --> 00:26:32,625
That bastard.

494
00:26:32,708 --> 00:26:35,250
Son of a bitch.

495
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:38,916
Men like this shouldn't have been born.

496
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:40,791
And though they have been,

497
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,875
I'm sure they are ugly.

498
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:47,666
Asshole.

Yes, sir.

00:48:13,291 --> 00:48:14,416
Yes, despite the hot weather,

I'm happy to see how you work.

-Nok.
-Yes?

861
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,541
Take my grandchildren to rest inside.

862
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,958
-Yes, sir.
-Go.

863
00:48:24,041 --> 00:48:25,625
Let's go, sister.

-Yes, maybe, we must ask them.

Let's ask him.

[in English] Excuse me, sir.
Do you know where the nearest hospital is?

Don't look at me like that.

[in English] That's very far.

873
00:48:47,083 --> 00:48:49,416
[in English] Do you think you could
maybe take us there?

874
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:50,708
[in English] Yes, of course.

Plarn!

878
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:00,250
What did you say?
I don't understand at all.

879
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:03,375
They asked me to take them
to the hospital.

-Yeah?
-Yes, sir.

881
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:08,500
You said something about 15 and 20.
Is that a hospital?

882
00:49:08,583 --> 00:49:10,333
Fifteen kilometers, sir.

883
00:49:10,416 --> 00:49:13,083
Fifteen to 20 kilometers away.

884

-Yeah?
-Yes.

885

What does "how are you" mean?

Who is this for?

That's Khun Bun Lue.

891
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:40,125
When did he come back
from Chiang Rai?

892
00:50:40,208 --> 00:50:42,083
Let's hurry up and go home.

893
00:50:42,166 --> 00:50:43,166
Just shut up.

894
00:50:43,958 --> 00:50:45,458
-Why?
-Hide.

-Why?

This one is also nice.

I can't decide.

900
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:04,375
It's okay.

901
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:06,875
We can keep looking,
and you can decide later.

902
00:51:06,958 --> 00:51:08,000
Yes.

903
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:20,041
We're late because of you.

00:51:20,458 --> 00:51:22,291
Let's get home.

As slippery as an eel,
as fast as a monkey.

906

That lady, the way she dresses up

907
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:50,375
is different from the locals here.

908
00:51:50,458 --> 00:51:52,375
She's a northerner.

909
00:51:54,291 --> 00:51:58,583
I guess Khun Bun Lue has a thing
for northern girls.

910
00:52:08,666 --> 00:52:10,000
Where did they go?

911

[man] That's your grandfather.

912
00:52:15,166 --> 00:52:16,416
Next is your great-grandfather.

913
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:21,500
And your great-great-grandfather.

914
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:27,000
Your great-great-grandfather...

915

Everyone was so handsome.

Do you like Caucasians?

Oh,

I prefer Asians.

922
00:52:42,750 --> 00:52:44,666
Caucasians are...

923
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:45,583
too big for me.

By the way, Khun Sriwichai,

927
00:52:57,125 --> 00:52:59,458
when do you plan to go back
to the South?

928
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:01,208
I'll go home tomorrow.

Hmm?

-Let's duel tonight.
-What?

931
00:53:05,041 --> 00:53:07,916
I didn't know you knew the Nora dance.

932
00:53:09,083 --> 00:53:10,083
No, I meant booze.

933
00:53:10,166 --> 00:53:13,416
Sure, what kind of boost do you need?

934
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,708
I meant a drinking duel.

935
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:20,583
♪ Booze means alcohol
Drinking it makes you stagger ♪

Go get us some delicious hors d'oeuvres.

There's nothing left in the kitchen.

Since you plan to install
electricity posts all over Phra Nakhon,

00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:35,500
Why don't we cover the Thon Buri District

We cannot, Luang Sorachak.

It will exceed our budget

logistics and construction.

you're right, Khun Bun Lue.

We'd better start
with the Pha Nakhon District.

00:58:53,375 --> 00:58:55,166
Why didn't you tell me, Mod?

1003
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:57,000
Because I wasn't certain about it.

1004
00:58:57,083 --> 00:58:59,375
But now I am 100% sure.

1005
00:58:59,458 --> 00:59:02,708
Since she's staying
in a house that he bought.

1006

Dresses elegantly,
speaking the Northern dialect.

1007
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:07,208
She must be from Chiang Rai.
Right, Mod?

1008
00:59:07,291 --> 00:59:09,125
Yes.

1009
00:59:11,750 --> 00:59:15,208
Then why does Bun Lue has to hide her?

1010
00:59:15,291 --> 00:59:18,833
It's in the DNA, ma'am, to be so sneaky.

1011
00:59:18,916 --> 00:59:20,500
I suppose it's more fun.

What are you looking at?

Never seen anyone get kicked
in the face?

1017

My nose is still intact.

1018
00:59:37,708 --> 00:59:39,833
Good thing her foot didn't stick
to my face,

1019
00:59:39,916 --> 00:59:42,750
otherwise people might call me
foot-face.

1020
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,041
You want more?

1021

No, ma'am.

1022

Keep it for the next time.

1023
01:00:01,958 --> 01:00:03,708
Do you want to see me,
Luang Sorachak?

1024
01:00:03,791 --> 01:00:04,791
Khun Bun Lue,

1025
01:00:05,375 --> 01:00:07,208
let's talk man to man.

1026
01:00:07,291 --> 01:00:08,125
What about?

1027
01:00:08,208 --> 01:00:10,000
About the power plant in Thon Buri.

1028
01:00:10,083 --> 01:00:13,333
If you convince the lord,

1029
01:00:13,416 --> 01:00:15,041
then we are all set.

1030
01:00:15,125 --> 01:00:17,541
Tell me how much you want.

1031
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:19,625
This kind of business

1032
01:00:20,458 --> 01:00:23,000
is not for me. It's dirty.

1033
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:26,791
Keep the money
and share it amongst you, gentlemen.

1034
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:31,333
If there's nothing else,
I'd like to bid you farewell.

Loy Krathong with anyone this year?

01:00:56,125 --> 01:00:57,666
I don't know yet.

[both] Come with me!

We can go if I finish work on time.

Otherwise we cannot.

1044
01:01:14,875 --> 01:01:16,916
This Loy Krathong Festival,

1045
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,375
what time does it start?

1046

That Khun Bun Lue, we can't let him
get away with this.

1050
01:01:35,875 --> 01:01:38,041
What are you going to do?

1051
01:01:39,208 --> 01:01:41,416
Get rid of him!

1052
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:42,458
Yes, sir.

1053
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:48,541
Why are you smiling?

Tharin, Thara, you can float
your Krathong over there.

-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1060

Let's go, sister.

-Be careful.
-Yes.

That's the lord.

Excuse me, Mother.

1064
01:02:32,208 --> 01:02:33,500
Sure, Bun Lue.

1065

-Look after my mother, Sonklin.
-Yes, sir.

1066
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:37,833
Don't bite her neck.

1067
01:02:37,916 --> 01:02:41,083
If I see you and a cobra,
I will hit you first.

We can't miss this festival, right?

1073
01:02:53,958 --> 01:02:57,000
Any progress on what he asked you to do?

1074

Everything is going smoothly, My Lady.

1075
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,708
Really? And where is he now?

1076
01:03:00,791 --> 01:03:03,125
Probably somewhere around here.

1077

I'll take care of it.

-My pleasure.

-I'll see you later, then.
-Sure.

-Oh, Sin.
-Yes, sir.

Why are you here just now?

I thought I was not going to come.

-What happened to your forehead?
-I got stung by a wasp.

-Stung by a wasp?
-Yes, sir.

-What kind of wasp?
-A bee, sir.

1088
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:35,541
-So what stung you?
-A wasp.

1089

-What kind?
-The bee kind.

So was it a wasp or a bee?

A wasp.

-What kind of wasp?
-The bee kind.

Was it a wasp or a bee?

-Yes, sir.

So was it a wasp or a bee?
He didn't make any sense.

Where have you been?

1103
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:21,333
Here. Take this.

1104
01:04:21,416 --> 01:04:25,666

Look here.

I told him I got stung by a wasp,

1112
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:47,375
but he kept asking if it was a bee.

1113
01:04:47,625 --> 01:04:51,125
I think he has gone nuts.

1114

gave someone a good beating.

Stay behind me, Plarn.
Give it back now.

1165
01:09:59,791 --> 01:10:01,041
Didn't you see he was playing?

1166
01:10:01,125 --> 01:10:03,916
I did. So what?

1167
01:10:04,416 --> 01:10:06,333
Oh, I see.

1168
01:10:06,583 --> 01:10:10,416
A heroine saving a damsel in distress.

1169
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:14,125
Look at you. Beauty and the Beast.

1170
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:17,541
Beast?

1171
01:10:17,625 --> 01:10:19,000
-Hey!
-Don't come any closer!

1172
01:10:19,083 --> 01:10:20,125
Tharin!

1173
01:10:25,916 --> 01:10:27,000
Plarn!

1174
01:10:27,791 --> 01:10:29,333
Take Tharin home.

1175
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:30,541
Yes, sir.

1176
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:37,125
You two listen to me.

1177
01:10:37,208 --> 01:10:39,458
This is my house and there're rules.

1178
01:10:40,125 --> 01:10:43,708
Whoever breaks those rules
must be whipped.

1179
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,291
Even a daughter of my friend
is no exception.

1180
01:10:49,625 --> 01:10:51,250
-Sin.
-Yes, sir.

1181
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,250
Bring me a cane.
Rak is holding it.

1182
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:55,875
Wouldn't it be easier
for him to just hand it to you

1183
01:10:55,958 --> 01:10:57,875
since he's holding it now?

1184
01:10:57,958 --> 01:10:59,916
This jerk... He asked you!

1185
01:11:00,375 --> 01:11:02,250
I know, but you can just hand it to him.

1186
01:11:02,333 --> 01:11:04,041
Come take it from me. He asked you.

1187
01:11:04,125 --> 01:11:05,333
I'm just holding it.

1188
01:11:05,416 --> 01:11:06,375
Have you no kindness?

1189
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:08,166
-He asked you to do it.
-I know.

1190
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:09,375
He asked you.
Take this and give it to him.

1191
01:11:09,458 --> 01:11:10,458
He asked you!

1192
01:11:10,541 --> 01:11:11,583
You could have just handed it to him.

1193
01:11:11,666 --> 01:11:13,000
You take it to him.

1194
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:14,166
-Have you no kindness, Rak?
-He asked you.

1195
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:15,250
I know.

1196
01:11:15,708 --> 01:11:16,875
You just hand it to him.

1197
01:11:16,958 --> 01:11:18,875
What the hell are you fighting about?

1198
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,875
You have a short uvula,
yet you can't stop talking.

1199
01:11:21,958 --> 01:11:25,458
"He asked you, he asked you."
What the heck?

1200
01:11:25,541 --> 01:11:26,916
I'm sorry, sir.

1201
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,333
May this be your lesson.

1202
01:11:29,625 --> 01:11:31,041
Sir.

1203
01:11:32,083 --> 01:11:33,708
It's not her fault at all.

1204
01:11:40,208 --> 01:11:42,041
I'll let you go this time.

1205
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:45,041
Don't ever do that again!

1206
01:11:49,666 --> 01:11:51,041
It's okay now.

1207
01:11:51,125 --> 01:11:52,750
You!

1208
01:11:52,833 --> 01:11:54,500
Piece of shit!

1209
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,083
You, too!

1210
01:11:57,166 --> 01:11:59,416
Such an easy task, and yet you failed.

1211
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:01,500
Then, what else can you do for a living?

1212
01:12:02,250 --> 01:12:04,041
I can sell coconut milk custard.

1213
01:12:11,791 --> 01:12:13,666
-Come back quickly.
-Fasten it tightly.

1214
01:12:13,916 --> 01:12:16,875
Last time you forgot gecko skin
and Du Zhong leaves.

Mod, take Kaeokanda away.

1223

-Hurry up!
-Yes, yes!

[thuds]

1226
01:13:45,541 --> 01:13:47,166
Hey, Silver, Goldie.

1227
01:13:47,625 --> 01:13:49,166
Where have you been?

1228
01:13:49,250 --> 01:13:50,750
Why are you hiding here?

1229
01:13:50,833 --> 01:13:52,625
Your daddy has been looking for you.

1230
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:54,416
Come quickly, Goldie.

1231
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:02,125
[whimpering]

1232
01:14:38,708 --> 01:14:40,666
Where have you been, Goldie?

1233
01:14:41,583 --> 01:14:43,000
Is that your girlfriend?

1234
01:14:43,666 --> 01:14:45,375
Go home and wait for me.

1235
01:14:45,458 --> 01:14:48,208
Sin.

1236
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:51,250
Come here.

1237
01:14:53,166 --> 01:14:54,541
Go.

1238
01:14:55,208 --> 01:14:57,291
Where have you been?

1239
01:14:57,375 --> 01:14:59,000
Something happened.

1240
01:14:59,083 --> 01:15:00,750
How many times have you shagged him?

1241
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:03,666
Who?

1242
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,875
Of course you know who.

1243
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:08,750
[speaking incoherently]

1244
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:13,375
This is her.

1245
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,250
Khun Bun Lue's girlfriend.

1246
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:17,875
The one Mod stalked.

1247
01:15:17,958 --> 01:15:19,625
She looks so plain.

1248
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:22,500
This is the one?

1249
01:15:23,541 --> 01:15:25,458
Why did you two have to date secretly?

1250
01:15:25,541 --> 01:15:27,791
[man] What's going on here?

1251
01:15:28,166 --> 01:15:29,833
Why so noisy?

1252
01:15:30,416 --> 01:15:34,208
[chuckles] Oh, Lady Bua.

1253
01:15:34,291 --> 01:15:36,833
What brings you here?

1254
01:15:36,916 --> 01:15:38,041
My Lord,

1255
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:40,583
I came to see Bun Lue's girlfriend.

1256
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,333
Bun Lue's girlfriend?

1257
01:15:42,416 --> 01:15:44,958
That's absurd, Lady Bua.

1258
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:46,291
She's not who you think.

1259
01:15:46,375 --> 01:15:47,750
She's not Bun Lue's girlfriend.

1260
01:15:48,541 --> 01:15:50,208
Her name is Kaeokanda.

1261
01:15:50,291 --> 01:15:51,541
She's from Chiang Rai,

1262
01:15:51,625 --> 01:15:53,666
my daughter in law.

1263
01:15:53,750 --> 01:15:56,041
She's my wife, Lady Bua.

1264
01:16:07,375 --> 01:16:08,791
These scandalmongers!

1265
01:16:09,958 --> 01:16:11,500
And you are credulous.

1266
01:16:11,583 --> 01:16:13,250
Why did you believe them?

1267
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:17,541
All of you, go home immediately!

1268
01:16:18,416 --> 01:16:19,541
You, too.

1269
01:16:20,666 --> 01:16:21,833
Go.

1270
01:16:24,083 --> 01:16:26,000
Kaeokanda, are you all right?

1271
01:16:27,000 --> 01:16:28,541
Yes, I'm all right.

1272
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:30,750
Luang Phiphat, please accept my apology.

1273
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:31,708
Of course.

1274
01:16:33,291 --> 01:16:35,541
Please forgive my people, my Lord.

1275
01:16:35,625 --> 01:16:37,125
No worries.

1276
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:38,500
Very well,

1277
01:16:38,916 --> 01:16:40,958
I'll take my leave now.

1278
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:43,083
Go, Sin.

1279
01:16:44,583 --> 01:16:46,333
This way, you fool.

1280
01:16:49,750 --> 01:16:51,208
Your big mouth...

1281
01:16:51,291 --> 01:16:53,625
always spewing nonsense,

1282
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:56,958
causing great misunderstandings.

1283
01:16:59,208 --> 01:17:01,666
You brought shame upon me.

1284
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,916
You will be whipped 30 times today.

1285
01:17:04,958 --> 01:17:07,333
So you won't do it again. Duangjai.

1286
01:17:07,416 --> 01:17:09,541
-Yes, sir?
-Get the cane from Bunleng.

1287
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:12,875
Wouldn't it be easier
if he just handed it to you?

1288
01:17:13,208 --> 01:17:15,500
I don't want to walk over there.

1289
01:17:19,291 --> 01:17:22,041
I just want the cane, not your face.

1290
01:17:22,125 --> 01:17:25,333
You're looking more and more
like a big toe every day.

1291
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:28,791
Get some surgery!
Perhaps you'll look more human.

1292
01:17:29,500 --> 01:17:30,625

Sir,

1295
01:17:35,833 --> 01:17:37,750
instead of whipping my mother 30 times,

1296
01:17:37,833 --> 01:17:40,166
can you whip me and my sister
ten times each?

1297
01:17:40,250 --> 01:17:42,125
So there would only be ten times left
for my mother.

1298
01:17:42,791 --> 01:17:46,125
Sure, if that's what you want.

1299

Maybe five times each?

At this age, why are you still

Be gentle.

Of course, it does.

You've never listened to me.

The reason why I kept it a secret

1429

is because I didn't want my mother
to find out

1493
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:21,333
[woman screaming]

1494
01:31:21,416 --> 01:31:22,458
[man] Khun Bun Lue got shot!

1495
01:31:22,541 --> 01:31:24,208
-What?
-Father!

1496
01:31:24,291 --> 01:31:25,291
Bun Lue!

1497
01:31:25,791 --> 01:31:27,916
-Shit!
-[man] Help!

1498
01:31:28,000 --> 01:31:29,958
-Khun Bun Lue got shot!
-[Plarn] Father!

1499
01:31:30,041 --> 01:31:31,666
[Mod] Bun Lue!

1500
01:31:31,750 --> 01:31:34,166
Bun Lue, stay with me!

1501
01:31:34,250 --> 01:31:36,000
You'll be all right.

1502
01:31:36,083 --> 01:31:38,375
Where is it, Father?

1503
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:40,250
-It hurts.
-Where?

1504
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:42,041
-Here.
-Oh, I'm sorry!

1505
01:31:42,125 --> 01:31:44,000
How are you?

1506
01:31:44,083 --> 01:31:45,458
Are you okay?

1507
01:31:45,541 --> 01:31:46,708
They missed the target.

1508
01:31:46,791 --> 01:31:48,791
-You didn't get shot?
-No.

1509
01:31:48,875 --> 01:31:50,416
[Sin in strained voice] Yes.

1510
01:31:50,500 --> 01:31:52,250
I got shot.

1511
01:31:53,458 --> 01:31:55,291
-What?
-What?

1512
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:59,750
-Sin.
-Sin.

1513
01:32:02,208 --> 01:32:03,875
Bun Lue, please help Sin!

1514
01:32:03,958 --> 01:32:06,625
Keerati! Keerati!

1515
01:32:06,708 --> 01:32:08,000
[Bua] Sin!

1516
01:32:08,083 --> 01:32:10,375
Sin was shot.

1517
01:32:11,041 --> 01:32:12,625
[wailing]

1518
01:32:15,250 --> 01:32:16,791
Wait until I get out of this.

1519
01:32:16,875 --> 01:32:19,916
It's so tight, you'll never be able
to escape.

1520
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,000
If you can't say something nice,
don't say anything at all.

1521
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:27,375
I told you. I warned you to stop.

1522
01:32:27,458 --> 01:32:28,583
Why don't you listen to me?

1523
01:32:28,916 --> 01:32:31,041
When did you warn me, sir?

1524
01:32:31,208 --> 01:32:33,000
I wasn't talking to you!

1525
01:32:33,333 --> 01:32:34,916
Should I beat you up now?

1526
01:32:35,791 --> 01:32:37,208
Send them to prison.

1527
01:32:39,833 --> 01:32:42,333
[Sorachak] Just you wait!

1528
01:32:42,416 --> 01:32:44,916
Forget it...

1529
01:32:45,375 --> 01:32:47,666
Rather than sending me to the hospital,

1530
01:32:47,750 --> 01:32:50,000
they wanted me to be the photographer.

1531
01:32:50,125 --> 01:32:51,166
[groaning]

1532
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:54,166
All right.

1533
01:32:54,833 --> 01:32:56,208
Smile, everyone.

1534
01:32:57,666 --> 01:32:58,708
One.

1535
01:32:58,791 --> 01:33:00,083
Two.

1536
01:33:00,166 --> 01:33:02,583
-Three. [groans loudly]
-[all yelling]

1537
01:33:11,166 --> 01:33:14,083
Who wrote this?

1538
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:17,708
-Whose letter is this?
-I have no idea.

1539
01:33:17,791 --> 01:33:19,625
It's from Chiang Rai.

1540
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:21,625
How could you not know?

1541
01:33:21,708 --> 01:33:23,166
Does it hurt, sir?

1542
01:33:23,250 --> 01:33:25,416
Why don't you try it yourself?

1543
01:33:25,500 --> 01:33:26,708
Call me Daddy.

1544
01:33:27,583 --> 01:33:30,750
[Mod] Answer me! Now, this is fun.

1545
01:33:30,833 --> 01:33:33,291
I like it.

1546
01:33:33,833 --> 01:33:37,083
-Hi, son.
-Son my ass!

1547
01:33:39,291 --> 01:33:41,875
Mother, aren't you going to help me?

1548
01:33:42,541 --> 01:33:45,958
Why should I? No bad deed goes unpunished.

1549
01:33:46,250 --> 01:33:47,916
Most importantly,

1550
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,375
you must respect your father, Bun Lue.

1551
01:33:51,125 --> 01:33:52,916
You can ask me.

1552
01:33:53,000 --> 01:33:54,833
Your mother does everything I say.

1553
01:33:54,916 --> 01:33:57,083
You are all the same.

1554
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:59,333
Just like Khun Theng and Khun Nong.

1555
01:34:00,166 --> 01:34:01,666
Why don't you answer my question?

1556
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:03,458
Is it fun?

1557
01:34:04,791 --> 01:34:07,041
[Mod] You sneaky bastard!

1558
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:10,958
You pervert carpet muncher!

1559
01:36:07,958 --> 01:36:09,958
