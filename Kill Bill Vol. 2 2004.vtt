00:15.044 --> 00:17.545
(Bill)
Do you find me sadistic?

00:19.115 --> 00:21.550
You know, Kiddo,

00:21.617 --> 00:24.052
I'd like to believe

00:24.120 --> 00:27.555
you're aware enough, even now,

00:27.623 --> 00:31.727
to know that there's
nothing sadistic

00:31.794 --> 00:34.864
in my actions.

00:34.932 --> 00:37.000
At this moment

00:38.536 --> 00:41.171
this is me

00:41.238 --> 00:43.974
at my most masochistic.

00:44.041 --> 00:46.776
Bill... it's your ba--

00:46.844 --> 00:49.112
(gunshot)

00:53.018 --> 00:55.119
(the bride)
Looked dead, didn't I?

00:55.187 --> 00:56.855
Well, I wasn't.

00:56.923 --> 01:00.526
But it wasn't from lack of
trying, I can tell you that.

01:00.593 --> 01:03.762
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

01:03.830 --> 01:07.767
a coma I was to lie in
for four years.

01:07.834 --> 01:10.136
When I woke up, I went on

01:10.204 --> 01:12.205
what the movie advertisements
refer to as

01:12.273 --> 01:15.809
"a roaring rampage
of revenge."

01:15.877 --> 01:18.912
I roared and I rampaged,

01:18.980 --> 01:22.616
and I got bloody satisfaction.

01:22.684 --> 01:26.454
I've killed a hell of a lot of
people to get to this point,

01:26.522 --> 01:29.791
but I have only one more.

01:29.859 --> 01:31.994
The last one.

01:32.062 --> 01:35.531
The one I'm driving to
right now.

01:35.599 --> 01:38.435
The only one left.

01:38.502 --> 01:42.172
And when I arrive
at my destination,

01:42.240 --> 01:45.543
I am gonna kill Bill.

01:45.568 --> 01:56.568

02:10.905 --> 02:12.539
(bride) Now, the incident
that happened

02:12.607 --> 02:14.341
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

02:14.409 --> 02:17.545
that put this whole gory
story into motion

02:17.612 --> 02:20.248
has since become legend.

02:20.315 --> 02:23.084
"Massacre at Two Pines."

02:23.151 --> 02:25.086
That's what the newspapers
called it.

02:25.153 --> 02:26.787
The local TV news called it

02:26.855 --> 02:31.058
"The El Paso, Texas,
Wedding Chapel Massacre."

02:31.126 --> 02:33.827
How it happened,
who was there,

02:33.895 --> 02:36.897
how many got killed
and who killed them

02:36.965 --> 02:40.467
changes depending on
who's telling the story.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.202
In actual fact,

02:42.270 --> 02:45.873
the massacre didn't happen
during a wedding at all.

02:45.941 --> 02:48.876
It was a wedding rehearsal.

02:48.944 --> 02:50.911
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

02:50.979 --> 02:54.749
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride,

02:54.816 --> 02:57.851
but don't stick your tongue
in her mouth.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.122
This might be funny
to your friends,

03:02.190 --> 03:05.393
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

03:06.862 --> 03:11.232
We'll try to restrain
ourselves, Reverend.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.267
Y'all got a song?

03:16.472 --> 03:20.142
How 'bout "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

03:20.209 --> 03:22.077
Sure.
Yeah.

03:22.145 --> 03:24.646
"Love Me Tender"'d be great.

03:24.714 --> 03:27.750
Rufus - he's the man.

03:27.818 --> 03:30.887
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

03:30.955 --> 03:32.956
Rufus Thomas.

03:33.024 --> 03:35.926
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

03:35.994 --> 03:38.862
I was a Drell.
I was a Drifter.

03:38.930 --> 03:40.330
I was a Coaster.

03:40.398 --> 03:44.101
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Bar-Kay.

03:44.168 --> 03:48.239
If they come through Texas,
I played with 'em.

03:48.306 --> 03:52.009
Rufus - he's the man.

03:54.713 --> 03:57.147
Have I forgotten anything?
Um...

03:57.215 --> 04:00.684
Oh, yes. You forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

04:00.752 --> 04:03.420
Thank you, Mother.
Yes.

04:03.488 --> 04:05.789
Now, the way we
normally do this,

04:05.857 --> 04:08.059
we have the bride's side,

04:08.126 --> 04:10.161
and then we have
the groom's side.

04:10.228 --> 04:13.330
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

04:13.398 --> 04:17.367
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'...

04:17.435 --> 04:20.337
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

04:22.072 --> 04:26.544
Right... Well, I don't
see no problem with...

04:26.611 --> 04:29.847
the groom's side sharing
the bride's side.

04:29.915 --> 04:32.784
Do you, Mother?
I don't have
a problem with that.

04:32.851 --> 04:34.819
But, uh...

04:34.886 --> 04:38.690
Honey, you know, it would be
good if you had somebody come.

04:38.758 --> 04:41.159
You know, as a sign
of good faith?

04:42.662 --> 04:45.297
Well, I don't have anybody,

04:45.364 --> 04:49.301
except for Tommy
and my friends.

04:49.369 --> 04:50.936
You have no family?

04:51.004 --> 04:53.973
Well, I'm workin'
on changing that.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.741
Mrs. Harmony,
we're all the family

04:55.809 --> 04:59.579
this little angel's
ever gonna need.

04:59.647 --> 05:01.381
I'm not feeling very well,

05:01.449 --> 05:04.083
and this bitch is starting
to piss me off.

05:04.151 --> 05:05.718
So while y'all blather on,

05:05.786 --> 05:07.454
I'm gonna go outside
and get some air.
OK.

05:07.521 --> 05:10.690
Um, uh, Reverend,
sorry, uh...

05:10.758 --> 05:12.191
She's gonna go out
and get some air.

05:12.259 --> 05:14.393
Yeah. Given her delicate
condition.

05:14.461 --> 05:17.063
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together.
She'll be OK.

05:17.130 --> 05:19.598
(reverend) Right.

05:19.666 --> 05:21.834

06:36.579 --> 06:38.013
Hello, Kiddo.

06:43.253 --> 06:46.121
How did you find me?

06:46.188 --> 06:47.889
I'm the man.

06:51.194 --> 06:54.763
What are you doin' here?

06:54.831 --> 06:56.732
What am I doin'?

06:58.502 --> 07:00.369
Well,

07:00.437 --> 07:03.673
a moment ago
I was playing my flute.

07:10.214 --> 07:13.250
At this moment

07:13.318 --> 07:15.319
I'm lookin' at the most
beautiful bride

07:15.387 --> 07:17.722
these old eyes have ever seen.

07:19.658 --> 07:23.161
Why are you here?
Last look.

07:25.664 --> 07:27.264
Are you gonna be nice?

07:27.332 --> 07:31.569
I've never been nice
my whole life.

07:31.636 --> 07:34.872
But I'll do my best
to be sweet.

07:34.940 --> 07:37.141
Hmm.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.677
I always told you,

07:39.744 --> 07:42.813
your sweet side
is your best side.

07:42.881 --> 07:47.217
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

07:49.621 --> 07:51.988
I see you got a bun
in the oven.

07:52.056 --> 07:56.994
Hmm. I'm knocked up.

07:57.061 --> 08:01.465
Jeez, Louise.
That young man of yours

08:01.532 --> 08:05.669
sure doesn't believe
in wasting time, does he?

08:05.737 --> 08:08.271
Have you seen Tommy?

08:10.274 --> 08:13.611
Big guy in the tux?
Yes.

08:13.678 --> 08:16.948
Then I saw him.

08:17.016 --> 08:20.418
I like his hair.

08:20.486 --> 08:24.856
You promised you'd be nice.

08:24.924 --> 08:29.427
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

08:29.495 --> 08:31.729
But you're right.

08:31.797 --> 08:36.633
What does your young man do
for a living?

08:36.701 --> 08:39.635
He owns a used-record store
here in El Paso.

08:39.703 --> 08:42.438
Ah. Music lover, eh?

08:42.506 --> 08:45.575
He's fond of music.

08:45.643 --> 08:47.410
Aren't we all?

08:51.448 --> 08:55.417
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

08:56.886 --> 08:59.855
I work in the record store.

08:59.922 --> 09:01.924
Aso.

09:03.493 --> 09:06.862
It all suddenly seems so clear.

09:08.965 --> 09:14.470
Do you like it?
Yeah. I like it
a lot, smartass.

09:14.538 --> 09:18.675
I get to listen to music all
day, talk about music all day.

09:18.743 --> 09:21.912
It's really cool.

09:21.980 --> 09:23.413
It's gonna be a great
environment

09:23.481 --> 09:25.449
for my little girl
to grow up in.

09:28.586 --> 09:33.289
As opposed to jetting
around the world,
killing human beings

09:33.357 --> 09:35.925
and being paid
vast sums of money?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.561
Precisely.

09:39.629 --> 09:42.597
Well, my old friend,

09:42.665 --> 09:45.034
to each his own.

09:45.101 --> 09:48.904
However,
all cockblockery aside,

09:48.972 --> 09:53.175
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

09:53.242 --> 09:58.513
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

10:01.049 --> 10:02.984
You want to come
to the wedding?

10:03.051 --> 10:04.819
Only if I can sit
on the bride's side.

10:06.422 --> 10:08.990
You'll find it a bit lonely
on my side.

10:09.057 --> 10:12.494
Your side always
was a bit lonely.

10:12.561 --> 10:15.863
But I wouldn't sit
anywhere else.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.068
You know,

10:20.136 --> 10:22.604
I had the loveliest dream
about you...

10:22.671 --> 10:25.073
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

10:25.141 --> 10:27.542
You must be Tommy!
Uh-huh.

10:27.610 --> 10:30.011
Arlene's told me
so much about you.

10:30.079 --> 10:32.847
Honey, you OK?
Oh, I'm fine.

10:32.915 --> 10:35.683
Tommy, I'd like you
to meet my father.

10:35.751 --> 10:38.686
Oh, my God!

10:38.754 --> 10:40.655
Oh, my God, this is great!

10:40.723 --> 10:43.458
I'm so glad to meet you,
sir... oh, Dad.

10:43.526 --> 10:45.827
The name's Bill.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.296
Well, it's great
to meet you... Bill.

10:48.364 --> 10:49.731
Arlene told me
you couldn't make it.

10:49.798 --> 10:53.001
Surprise.
That's my pop for ya.

10:53.068 --> 10:54.935
Always full of surprises.

10:55.003 --> 10:58.439
Well,
in the surprise department,

10:58.507 --> 11:01.876
the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

11:01.944 --> 11:04.078
When did you get in?
Just now.

11:04.146 --> 11:07.314
Did you come straight
from Australia?
Of course.

11:07.382 --> 11:10.217
Daddy, I told Tommy that you
were in Perth mining for silver,

11:10.285 --> 11:13.386
and no one could reach you.

11:13.454 --> 11:16.656
Lucky for us all,
that's not the case.

11:16.724 --> 11:20.459
So... What's this all about?

11:20.527 --> 11:22.761
I've heard of
wedding rehearsals,

11:22.829 --> 11:24.664
but I don't believe
I've ever heard of

11:24.731 --> 11:26.966
a wedding dress rehearsal
before.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.702
We thought, "Why pay
so much money for a dress

11:29.770 --> 11:31.570
you're only gonna wear once?"

11:31.638 --> 11:34.740
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

11:34.808 --> 11:39.846
So I think we're gonna try
to get all the mileage
we can out of it.

11:39.914 --> 11:42.182
Isn't it supposed to be
bad luck for the groom

11:42.249 --> 11:44.785
to see the bride
in her wedding dress

11:44.853 --> 11:46.220
before the ceremony?

11:46.288 --> 11:48.021
Well...

11:48.089 --> 11:50.657
I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

11:52.527 --> 11:54.695
I know just what you mean.

11:54.763 --> 11:57.898
(reverend) Son.
Some of us have places to be.

11:57.965 --> 11:59.666
(Rufus) Sure do.

11:59.733 --> 12:02.168
Look, we gotta go through this
one more time,

12:02.235 --> 12:04.170
so why don't you have a s...

12:04.238 --> 12:06.172
Oh, my God.

12:06.239 --> 12:08.374
What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

12:08.442 --> 12:12.010
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

12:12.078 --> 12:14.580
I think Father would
be much more comfortable

12:14.648 --> 12:16.248
sitting with the rest
of the guests.

12:16.316 --> 12:17.449
Hmm. Really?

12:17.517 --> 12:19.652
That's asking a lot.

12:21.254 --> 12:23.956
Oh. OK. Well, forget it.

12:24.024 --> 12:26.793
But how about we go
out to dinner tonight
to celebrate?

12:26.860 --> 12:29.596
Only on the condition
that I pay for everything.

12:29.663 --> 12:32.265
Deal. We got to do this now.

12:32.333 --> 12:36.437
Can I watch?
Absolutely. Have a seat.

12:36.505 --> 12:39.974
Which is the bride's side?
Right over here.

12:42.344 --> 12:45.179
(reverend)
Mother, here we go!

12:46.749 --> 12:49.451
Now, son, about them vows...

12:51.120 --> 12:53.355
(♪ guitar)

12:56.226 --> 12:59.327
Bill... I just want...

12:59.395 --> 13:03.365
You don't owe me a damn thing.

13:03.432 --> 13:05.867
If he's the man you want,

13:05.935 --> 13:09.070
then go stand by him.

13:32.397 --> 13:36.300
Do I look pretty?
Oh, yes.

13:47.144 --> 13:49.112
Thank you.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.547
(reverend) What the hell?

14:25.615 --> 14:26.949
(screaming)

14:27.017 --> 14:28.984
(bride) No! Bill!

14:29.052 --> 14:31.753
(machine-gun fire)

14:35.658 --> 14:37.292
(barking)

14:37.360 --> 14:39.628
(bell tolls)

14:57.545 --> 14:59.546
(bird chirps)

15:07.489 --> 15:11.826
You tellin' me she cut her way
through 88 bodyguards

15:11.894 --> 15:14.329
'fore she got to O-Ren?

15:14.397 --> 15:16.665
Nah, there wasn't
really 88 of 'em.

15:16.733 --> 15:19.302
They just call themselves
"The Crazy 88."

15:19.369 --> 15:21.537
How come?
I don't know.

15:21.605 --> 15:24.673
I guess they thought
it sounded cool.

15:24.741 --> 15:28.477
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

15:28.545 --> 15:30.479
She got a Hanzo sword?

15:30.547 --> 15:32.581
He made one for her.

15:32.649 --> 15:36.085
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

15:36.153 --> 15:39.689
It would appear
he has broken it.

15:42.092 --> 15:45.228
Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

15:48.165 --> 15:52.735
Or maybe... you just tend
to bring that out in people.

15:52.803 --> 15:58.108
I know this is a ridiculous
question before I ask it,

15:58.175 --> 16:02.612
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your... swordplay?

16:05.216 --> 16:07.317
I, um...

16:07.385 --> 16:10.888
(belches) I pawned that
years ago.

16:10.955 --> 16:15.292
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo
sword?

16:15.359 --> 16:16.460
Yep.

16:16.527 --> 16:19.729
It was priceless.

16:23.200 --> 16:26.102
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

16:27.570 --> 16:30.539
In El Paso,
I got me $250 for it.

16:32.341 --> 16:35.877
I'm a bouncer
in a titty bar, Bill.

16:35.945 --> 16:38.212
(sniffs)

16:38.280 --> 16:40.214
If she wants to fight with me,
all she's gotta do is

16:40.282 --> 16:42.350
come down to the club
and start some shit,

16:42.417 --> 16:45.720
and we'll be in a fight.

16:45.788 --> 16:50.591
I know we haven't spoken
in some time,

16:50.659 --> 16:54.529
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

16:54.597 --> 16:58.967
but you've got to get over
being mad at me

16:59.035 --> 17:01.302
and start becoming
afraid of (bleep)

17:01.370 --> 17:06.141
because she is coming,
and she's coming to kill you.

17:06.209 --> 17:07.810
And, unless you accept
my assistance,

17:07.877 --> 17:10.445
I have no doubt
she will succeed.

17:19.388 --> 17:21.423
I don't dodge guilt

17:21.491 --> 17:24.292
and I don't jew out of
paying my comeuppance.

17:26.596 --> 17:29.932
Can't we just...
forget the past?

17:32.802 --> 17:34.804
That woman

17:34.871 --> 17:37.273
deserves her revenge.

17:41.946 --> 17:46.916
And we deserve to die.

17:51.188 --> 17:53.823
But, then again,

17:53.891 --> 17:56.059
so does she.

17:59.397 --> 18:02.131
So I guess

18:02.199 --> 18:05.501
we'll just see.

18:05.569 --> 18:07.570
Won't we?

18:24.289 --> 18:27.191
(♪ distant music)

18:37.370 --> 18:39.838
(♪ woman singing in Spanish)

18:44.110 --> 18:45.944
Late again.

18:46.012 --> 18:49.247
Budd, can't you tell time?

18:49.315 --> 18:51.116
There ain't nobody in here, man.

18:51.184 --> 18:53.518
(man) Is that Budd?
Yeah.

18:53.586 --> 18:56.588
(man) Tell him to get
his fucking ass back here!

18:56.656 --> 18:58.557
OK.

18:58.625 --> 19:02.894
Budd, Larry'd like a word
with ya.

19:06.599 --> 19:09.434
Take a hit. Be somebody, baby.

19:18.276 --> 19:20.410
You looking for me?

19:26.952 --> 19:30.554
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here

19:30.622 --> 19:32.857
that let you stroll in
20 minutes late,

19:32.924 --> 19:35.592
but it wasn't owned by me
and I own a fuckin' car wash.

19:35.660 --> 19:37.661
Do you want me to leave?
No, I don't want you
to leave.

19:37.729 --> 19:40.130
I want you to sit and wait.

19:40.198 --> 19:42.232
Larry,

19:42.300 --> 19:45.202
there ain't nobody
out there, so...

19:45.270 --> 19:50.908
(slurring) "There's nobody
out there, Larry."

19:50.976 --> 19:54.712
What's your point?
That you're not needed here?

19:54.780 --> 19:59.550
My point is I'm the bouncer,

19:59.618 --> 20:02.420
and there ain't nobody
out there to bounce.

20:02.488 --> 20:05.790
You saying that the reason

20:05.858 --> 20:10.929
that you're not doing the job
that I'm paying you to do

20:10.997 --> 20:14.199
is that you don't
have a job to do?

20:16.502 --> 20:18.770
No...
Is that what you're saying?

20:18.838 --> 20:20.872
What are you trying
to convince me of, exactly?

20:20.940 --> 20:24.809
That you're as useless
as an asshole right here?

20:24.877 --> 20:27.212
Well, guess what, buddy.

20:27.280 --> 20:32.518
I think you just fucking
convinced me.

20:32.586 --> 20:34.787
Let's go to the calendar.

20:34.855 --> 20:37.057
It's calendar time.

20:37.124 --> 20:39.626
Calendar time for Buddy.

20:39.694 --> 20:43.062
OK. You working tomorrow?
Yeah.

20:43.130 --> 20:45.197
Mm. No, you're n...

20:45.265 --> 20:47.233
You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

20:47.301 --> 20:49.335
Here. You're not working
tomorrow.

20:49.402 --> 20:52.370
You're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

20:52.438 --> 20:54.806
Workin' Thursday?
Yeah.

20:54.874 --> 20:58.943
I don't think so. Friday?

20:59.011 --> 21:01.312
I d... There's your name.

21:01.380 --> 21:04.348
If you say so.
There used to be
your name. OK?

21:04.416 --> 21:07.384
Saturday.
There used to be your name.
Oh.

21:07.452 --> 21:10.988
Uh, Monday...
Here, how about that?

21:11.055 --> 21:12.823
Fuckin' with your cash
is the only thing

21:12.890 --> 21:17.160
you kids seem to understand. OK?

21:17.228 --> 21:19.429
Now, I want you to go home
till I call you.

21:19.497 --> 21:21.898
Till I call you.

21:21.966 --> 21:23.600
Before you leave,
talk to Rocket.

21:23.668 --> 21:27.370
She's got a job for you to do.

21:27.438 --> 21:30.306
And...

21:30.374 --> 21:33.176
the hat.

21:33.243 --> 21:36.112
That fuckin' hat.

21:36.179 --> 21:38.981
That fucking hat.

21:39.048 --> 21:41.983
How many times have I told you,

21:42.051 --> 21:45.988
don't wear that fucking hat
here? How many?

21:50.560 --> 21:52.127
Customers wear hats.

21:52.195 --> 21:54.829
Well, I'm not the boss
of the customers.

21:54.897 --> 21:57.332
I'm the boss of you.

21:57.400 --> 21:59.301
And I'm telling you
that I want you

21:59.368 --> 22:03.305
to keep that shit-kicker hat
at home.

22:20.990 --> 22:23.058
(lighter clicks open)

22:24.827 --> 22:27.763
(lighter clicks open
and closes)

22:37.240 --> 22:41.510
Yeah, Budd, honey, uh,
the toilet is at it again.

22:41.578 --> 22:44.580
There's shitty water
all over the floor.

22:44.647 --> 22:48.116
OK... Rocket.

22:50.186 --> 22:53.155
I'll clean it up.
Mm-hmm.

29:50.378 --> 29:55.549

that's what I call sharp.

29:55.617 --> 29:57.518

29:57.586 --> 30:00.621
Oh, that's hard to say,

One condition.

damn well guarantee.

That's a can of Mace.

34:13.975 --> 34:16.877
Mm-hmm. No.

34:16.945 --> 34:20.380
You're goin' underneath

34:20.447 --> 34:24.252

there is to it.

34:27.356 --> 34:29.625
I wanna bury ya.

34:32.295 --> 34:34.496
I was gonna bury ya...

34:38.702 --> 34:40.603
(chuckles)

34:40.670 --> 34:42.138
...with this.

34:45.342 --> 34:48.545
But if you're gonna act

this whole goddamn can

34:55.387 --> 34:57.521

34:57.589 --> 35:00.558
I'll burn 'em right
outta your fuckin' head.

35:00.626 --> 35:04.028
Then you're gonna be blind

35:04.095 --> 35:05.196

35:08.600 --> 35:10.468

35:16.208 --> 35:18.142

37:39.385 --> 37:41.186
(thud)

37:41.254 --> 37:44.689
(whimpers)

37:44.757 --> 37:46.758
(thud)

37:48.861 --> 37:50.995
(groans)

37:53.299 --> 37:55.968
(sobbing/distant thud)

37:59.539 --> 38:02.741
(groans)

38:02.809 --> 38:06.011
(sobbing)

38:06.079 --> 38:08.581
(faint rumbling)

38:17.391 --> 38:19.793
(sobs)

38:19.860 --> 38:22.029
(panting)

38:27.101 --> 38:29.135
(grunts)

38:31.372 --> 38:33.673
(enraged grunting)

38:42.549 --> 38:44.550
(engine starts up)

38:46.853 --> 38:49.788
(vehicle leaves)

38:49.856 --> 38:52.023
(crying)

39:15.880 --> 39:18.048
(♪ flute)

39:36.635 --> 39:39.237
Once upon a time

39:39.304 --> 39:42.139
in China,

39:42.207 --> 39:49.647
some believe around the year
one, double aught, three,

39:49.714 --> 39:52.850
head priest of
the White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei,

39:52.918 --> 39:57.121
was walking down a road

39:57.189 --> 39:59.323
contemplating whatever it is

39:59.391 --> 40:05.463
that a man of Pai Mei's
infinite powers
would contemplate -

40:05.531 --> 40:09.869
which is another way
of saying "Who knows?" -

40:09.936 --> 40:13.205
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road,

40:13.273 --> 40:15.774
traveling in the opposite
direction.

40:15.842 --> 40:20.280
As the monk and the priest
crossed paths,

40:20.347 --> 40:22.482
Pai Mei,

40:22.549 --> 40:28.020
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity,

40:28.088 --> 40:33.124
gave the monk
the slightest of nods.

40:33.192 --> 40:35.226
The nod

40:35.294 --> 40:37.528
was not returned.

40:37.596 --> 40:40.764
(♪ note)

40:40.832 --> 40:44.134
Now, was it the intention
of the Shaolin monk

40:44.202 --> 40:47.104
to insult Pai Mei?

40:47.171 --> 40:52.175
Or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?

40:52.243 --> 40:57.214
The motives of the monk
remain unknown.

40:57.282 --> 40:59.383
What is known

40:59.450 --> 41:02.185
were the consequences.

41:03.287 --> 41:05.689
(♪ flute)

41:13.698 --> 41:16.033
The next morning,

41:16.100 --> 41:20.404
Pai Mei appeared
at the Shaolin temple

41:20.472 --> 41:23.674
and demanded
of the temple's head abbot

41:23.742 --> 41:30.448
that he offer Pai Mei his neck
to repay the insult.

41:30.516 --> 41:34.886
The abbot, at first,
tried to console Pai Mei,

41:34.954 --> 41:38.857
only to find Pai Mei was

41:38.925 --> 41:40.626
inconsolable.

41:40.694 --> 41:42.861
(♪ flute)

41:52.004 --> 41:54.371
So began

41:54.439 --> 41:56.974
the Massacre
of the Shaolin Temple

41:57.041 --> 42:00.243
and all sixty
of the monks inside,

42:00.311 --> 42:03.846
at the fists of the White Lotus.

42:03.914 --> 42:07.817
And so began the legend

42:07.885 --> 42:12.188
of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

42:12.256 --> 42:13.456
And what, pray tell,

42:13.524 --> 42:16.159
is the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique?

42:16.226 --> 42:22.031
Quite simply, the deadliest blow
in all of martial arts.

42:23.768 --> 42:27.304
He hits you with his fingertips

42:27.371 --> 42:31.308
at five different pressure
points on your body,

42:31.376 --> 42:35.512
and then lets you walk away.

42:35.579 --> 42:38.448
But once you've taken five steps

42:38.515 --> 42:42.552
your heart explodes
inside your body

42:42.620 --> 42:46.790
and you fall to the floor, dead.

42:46.857 --> 42:50.861
Did he teach you that?
No.

42:50.928 --> 42:55.967
He teaches no one
the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

42:56.034 --> 42:58.403
Now,

42:58.470 --> 43:03.174
one of the things I've always
liked about you, Kiddo,

43:05.110 --> 43:08.646
is you appear wise
beyond your years.

43:11.950 --> 43:16.587
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise.

43:16.655 --> 43:18.289
Whatever...

43:18.357 --> 43:22.327
Whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

43:23.729 --> 43:27.432
If you flash him, even for
an instant, a defiant eye,

43:27.500 --> 43:29.834
he'll pluck it out.

43:29.902 --> 43:34.205
And if you throw
any American sass his way,

43:34.273 --> 43:38.443
he'll snap your back and your
neck like they were twigs.

43:40.846 --> 43:43.781
And that will be
the story of you.

43:46.418 --> 43:48.419
(♪ flute)

44:04.067 --> 44:06.635
He'll accept you as his student.

44:06.703 --> 44:08.704
What happened to you?
Nothin'.

44:08.771 --> 44:11.940
Get in a fight?
Friendly contest.

44:12.008 --> 44:13.542
Why did he accept me?

44:13.609 --> 44:17.779
Because he's a very,
very, very old man.

44:17.847 --> 44:21.083
And, like all rotten bastards,

44:21.151 --> 44:26.321
when they become old,
they get lonely.

44:26.389 --> 44:29.358
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

44:29.425 --> 44:34.129
but it does teach them
the value of company.

44:34.197 --> 44:36.765
Whew. Oh.

44:36.833 --> 44:42.304
(sighs) Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

44:42.372 --> 44:45.340
You're gonna have a lot of fun
carrying buckets of water

44:45.408 --> 44:47.842
up and down that fucker.

44:52.148 --> 44:54.282
When will I see you again?

44:54.350 --> 44:57.886
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the 70s.

44:57.954 --> 44:59.654
What?
Nothin'.

44:59.722 --> 45:03.191
When he tells me you're done.

45:03.259 --> 45:04.926
When do you think
that might be?

45:04.994 --> 45:07.929
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

45:07.997 --> 45:11.666
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no back talk.

45:11.734 --> 45:14.102
At least not
for the first year or so.

45:14.170 --> 45:17.272
You're gonna have to
let him warm up to you.

45:17.340 --> 45:21.208
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

45:21.276 --> 45:24.078
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

45:26.448 --> 45:30.852
So in your case...
it might take a little while.

45:30.919 --> 45:32.286
Adiós.

45:32.354 --> 45:34.355
(starts engine)

47:41.151 --> 47:42.351
A little.

48:15.355 --> 48:18.623
I am proficient
in Tiger-Crane Style,

48:18.691 --> 48:20.125
and I am more than proficient

48:20.192 --> 48:22.761
in the exquisite art
of the Samurai sword.

48:22.828 --> 48:24.129
(scoffs)

48:34.307 --> 48:36.509
(laughs)

48:52.626 --> 48:54.661
(laughs)

49:45.711 --> 49:48.413
(whooshes)

50:20.545 --> 50:23.313
(grunts)

50:23.381 --> 50:25.449
(grunts)

50:34.960 --> 50:36.961

50:45.604 --> 50:47.538
(grunting)

51:37.656 --> 51:39.723
(grunts)

51:46.498 --> 51:49.567

51:49.635 --> 51:52.436
(grunts/laughs)

52:00.312 --> 52:02.614
(laughs)

52:05.184 --> 52:07.352
Argh!

52:09.288 --> 52:10.922
Argh!

52:25.338 --> 52:26.605
No, please don't!

52:26.672 --> 52:28.073
(laughs)

52:33.245 --> 52:35.480
Aaargh!

53:06.212 --> 53:08.280
Yes!

53:18.692 --> 53:21.261
(yells)

53:57.934 --> 54:00.802
(grunts)

54:00.870 --> 54:02.938
(grunts)

54:10.947 --> 54:13.015

54:14.617 --> 54:17.085

54:17.153 --> 54:18.854

54:30.899 --> 54:32.366

54:45.412 --> 54:48.948
(grunting)

54:49.016 --> 54:50.850
(continues grunting)

54:53.821 --> 54:55.855
(grunting)

55:06.301 --> 55:08.369
(continues grunting)

55:12.006 --> 55:14.174
(gasping)

55:24.020 --> 55:26.488
(grunting)

55:29.058 --> 55:31.226
(yelling)

55:39.135 --> 55:41.270
(continues yelling)

55:44.574 --> 55:46.876
(rainfall)

57:03.787 --> 57:05.855
(sighs)

57:11.795 --> 57:14.063
(sighs)

57:25.309 --> 57:27.444
(whoosh)

58:19.097 --> 58:21.565
(grunts)

59:06.280 --> 59:08.648
(grunts)

01:00:02.503 --> 01:00:06.205
Come on, you bitch.

01:00:07.808 --> 01:00:09.175
(grunts)

01:00:47.146 --> 01:00:49.815
OK, Pai Mei.

01:00:51.985 --> 01:00:54.053
Here I come.

01:00:56.991 --> 01:00:59.359
(grunting)

01:02:02.718 --> 01:02:05.019
(gasping)

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.958
(wheezing)

01:02:18.467 --> 01:02:20.568
(grunts)

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.506
(gasping)

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:32.480
(wheezing)

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:37.285
(panting)

01:02:53.937 --> 01:02:56.004
(bell chimes)

01:03:02.945 --> 01:03:06.047
May I have a glass
of water, please?

01:03:29.171 --> 01:03:30.605
(screeching)

01:05:44.209 --> 01:05:47.644
So that's a Texas funeral?
Yep.

01:05:49.247 --> 01:05:51.582
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

01:05:51.650 --> 01:05:54.852
That's a pretty
fucked-up way to die.

01:05:54.919 --> 01:05:57.187
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?

01:05:57.255 --> 01:05:59.489
Paula

01:06:01.425 --> 01:06:03.526
Schultz.

01:06:08.799 --> 01:06:10.733
Can I look at the sword?

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:13.835
That's my money right there
in that red bag, isn't it?

01:06:13.903 --> 01:06:16.705
It sure is.

01:06:16.773 --> 01:06:19.675
Well, then,
it's your sword now.

01:06:35.323 --> 01:06:37.891
(blender drowns out
Elle's voice)

01:06:37.959 --> 01:06:40.259
What's that you said?

01:06:40.327 --> 01:06:42.461
So this is
a Hattori Hanzo sword.

01:06:42.529 --> 01:06:45.131
That's a Hanzo sword,
all right.

01:06:45.199 --> 01:06:49.535
Bill tells me you once had
one of these of your own.

01:06:49.603 --> 01:06:51.638
Yeah, once.

01:06:51.706 --> 01:06:54.207
Yeah? How does this one
compare to that?

01:07:03.585 --> 01:07:08.589
If you're gonna compare
a Hanzo sword,

01:07:08.656 --> 01:07:12.525
you compare it to every
other sword ever made -

01:07:12.593 --> 01:07:16.496
wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

01:07:22.469 --> 01:07:24.803
(sniffs/clears throat)

01:07:24.871 --> 01:07:28.541
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.

01:07:37.784 --> 01:07:40.319
So,

01:07:40.387 --> 01:07:43.589
which "R" are you filled with?

01:07:43.657 --> 01:07:45.524
What?

01:07:48.295 --> 01:07:50.330
They say

01:07:50.398 --> 01:07:54.702
the number-one killer
of old people

01:07:54.769 --> 01:07:58.038
is retirement.

01:07:58.106 --> 01:08:00.107
People got a job to do,

01:08:00.175 --> 01:08:04.278
they tend to live a little bit
longer so they can do it.

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:08.083
I've always figured that

01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:13.988
warriors and their enemies
share the same relationship.

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:15.990
So now that you're
not gonna have to

01:08:16.058 --> 01:08:20.629
face your enemy no more
on the battlefield,

01:08:20.697 --> 01:08:24.066
which "R" ya filled with?

01:08:25.501 --> 01:08:27.568
Relief?

01:08:30.104 --> 01:08:33.473
Or regret?

01:08:33.541 --> 01:08:35.776
A little bit of both.

01:08:35.844 --> 01:08:39.145
Horseshit.

01:08:39.212 --> 01:08:42.015
I'm sure you do feel
a little bit of both.

01:08:42.082 --> 01:08:45.852
But I know damn well
that you feel one

01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.622
more than you feel the other.

01:08:48.689 --> 01:08:52.859
And the question was,
which one is it?

01:08:54.962 --> 01:08:57.898
Regret.

01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:00.401
You know, you gotta
hand it to the old girl.

01:09:00.468 --> 01:09:05.337
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.

01:09:05.406 --> 01:09:07.474
Bill thought
she was so damn smart.

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:09.876
And I tried to tell him

01:09:09.944 --> 01:09:12.212
she was just smart for a blonde.

01:09:31.399 --> 01:09:33.233
Thanks a bunch.

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:42.910
(sniffs/clears throat)

01:09:42.978 --> 01:09:45.546
(chuckles)

01:09:45.613 --> 01:09:47.514
All right.

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:50.317
(hissing)

01:09:50.385 --> 01:09:52.819
Argh! Argh!

01:10:02.632 --> 01:10:04.699
(groans)

01:10:17.213 --> 01:10:19.782
Mmm.

01:10:19.849 --> 01:10:21.783
I'm sorry, Budd.

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:24.453
That was rude of me,
wasn't it?

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:28.024
Budd, I'd like to introduce
my friend, the black mamba.

01:10:28.092 --> 01:10:31.127
Black mamba, this is Budd.

01:10:31.195 --> 01:10:33.763
You know, before I picked
that little fella up,

01:10:33.831 --> 01:10:35.966
I looked him up on the Internet.

01:10:36.034 --> 01:10:39.236
Fascinating creature,
the black mamba.

01:10:39.304 --> 01:10:41.906
Listen to this.

01:10:41.974 --> 01:10:44.074
(groans)

01:10:46.044 --> 01:10:48.379
"In Africa, the saying goes

01:10:48.447 --> 01:10:50.982
'In the bush,
an elephant can kill you,

01:10:51.049 --> 01:10:52.583
a leopard can kill you,

01:10:52.651 --> 01:10:54.585
and a black mamba
can kill you.

01:10:54.653 --> 01:10:56.620
But only with the mamba,

01:10:56.688 --> 01:10:58.189
and this has been
true in Africa

01:10:58.256 --> 01:10:59.924
since the dawn of time,

01:10:59.991 --> 01:11:01.225
is death sure.'"

01:11:01.293 --> 01:11:05.964
"Hence its handle,
'Death Incarnate.'"

01:11:06.031 --> 01:11:08.032
Pretty cool, huh?

01:11:09.602 --> 01:11:13.271
"Its neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,

01:11:13.339 --> 01:11:16.675
acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis."

01:11:16.742 --> 01:11:20.278
"The venom of a black mamba
can kill a human being
in four hours

01:11:20.346 --> 01:11:23.048
if, say, bitten on the ankle
or the thumb."

01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:26.551
"However, a bite
to the face or torso

01:11:26.619 --> 01:11:29.821
can bring death from paralysis
within 20 minutes."

01:11:29.889 --> 01:11:33.591
Now, you should listen to this,
'cause this concerns you.

01:11:35.394 --> 01:11:38.229
"The amount of venom that can
be delivered from a single bite

01:11:38.297 --> 01:11:41.565
can be gargantuan."

01:11:41.633 --> 01:11:44.135
You know, I've always liked
that word "gargantuan."

01:11:44.203 --> 01:11:48.106
I so rarely have an opportunity
to use it in a sentence.

01:11:48.174 --> 01:11:50.541
"If not treated quickly
with antivenom,

01:11:50.609 --> 01:11:53.445
ten to 15 milligrams
can be fatal to human beings."

01:11:53.512 --> 01:11:56.047
"However, the black mamba
can deliver

01:11:56.115 --> 01:11:59.385
as much as 100 to 400
milligrams of venom

01:11:59.452 --> 01:12:01.987
from a single bite."

01:12:04.124 --> 01:12:06.692
Now,

01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:11.697
in these last agonizing
minutes of life you have left,

01:12:11.765 --> 01:12:14.733
let me answer that question
you asked earlier
more thoroughly.

01:12:18.038 --> 01:12:21.140
Right at this moment

01:12:21.207 --> 01:12:24.577
the biggest "R" I feel
is regret.

01:12:26.613 --> 01:12:29.048
Regret that maybe

01:12:29.116 --> 01:12:32.452
the greatest warrior
I have ever met

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:38.593
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin', scrub,

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:42.563
alky piece of shit like you.

01:12:44.499 --> 01:12:46.901
That woman deserved better.

01:12:48.370 --> 01:12:50.671
(moaning stops)

01:13:26.574 --> 01:13:29.009
(cell phone rings)

01:13:30.912 --> 01:13:33.580
Bill.

01:13:33.648 --> 01:13:36.883
I have some tragic news.

01:13:36.951 --> 01:13:39.719
Your brother's dead.

01:13:39.787 --> 01:13:42.656
I am so sorry, baby.

01:13:42.723 --> 01:13:46.192
She put a black mamba
in his camper.

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:49.729
I got her, sweetie. She's dead.

01:13:51.331 --> 01:13:53.165
Let me put it this way,

01:13:53.233 --> 01:13:55.401
you ever start feeling
sentimental,

01:13:55.468 --> 01:13:57.569
go to Barstow, California.

01:13:57.637 --> 01:14:01.539
When you get here,
walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.

01:14:01.606 --> 01:14:04.442
Then you take those flowers
to Huntington Cemetery

01:14:04.509 --> 01:14:06.444
on Fuller and Guadalupe,

01:14:06.512 --> 01:14:08.913
look for the headstone
marked "Paula Schultz,"

01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:11.048
and lay them on the grave.

01:14:11.116 --> 01:14:16.954
'Cause you will be standing
at the final resting place
of Beatrix Kiddo.

01:14:17.022 --> 01:14:19.558
Marty Kitrosser?
Here.

01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:21.426
Melanie Harrhouse?
Here.

01:14:21.494 --> 01:14:23.962
Beatrix Kiddo?
Here.

01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:27.599
Look... I can be there
in about four hours.

01:14:27.667 --> 01:14:30.068
Do you want me to come over?

01:14:30.136 --> 01:14:33.572
No, no, no, no.
You need me, baby, I'm there.

01:14:36.275 --> 01:14:39.144
OK. I'm leaving now.

01:14:39.211 --> 01:14:42.247
You go smoke some pot
or somethin'.
I'll be there soon.

01:14:57.228 --> 01:14:59.629
(grunting)

01:15:43.676 --> 01:15:45.643
Ugh.

01:15:45.711 --> 01:15:47.812
Gross.

01:16:07.331 --> 01:16:10.300
Yaagh!

01:16:43.601 --> 01:16:45.736
Agh!

01:16:58.583 --> 01:17:00.651
Hi-ya!

01:17:10.194 --> 01:17:13.364
"To my brother, Budd.
The only man I ever loved.

01:17:13.431 --> 01:17:15.065
Bill."

01:17:25.877 --> 01:17:28.980
What's that?

01:17:30.482 --> 01:17:32.883
Budd's Hanzo sword.

01:17:32.951 --> 01:17:35.418
He said he pawned it.

01:17:35.486 --> 01:17:39.189
Guess that makes him
a liar now, don't it?

01:17:42.793 --> 01:17:46.596
Elle?
Bea.

01:17:46.663 --> 01:17:49.566
Somethin' I've always
been curious about.

01:17:49.634 --> 01:17:51.902
Just between us girls,

01:17:53.371 --> 01:17:57.809
what did you say to Pai Mei
to make him snatch out your eye?

01:17:57.877 --> 01:18:00.579
Argh! Ow! Ow!

01:18:01.548 --> 01:18:04.783
I called him a miserable
old fool.

01:18:04.851 --> 01:18:07.486
Ooh.

01:18:07.554 --> 01:18:09.956
Bad idea.

01:18:10.024 --> 01:18:11.758
Know what I did?

01:18:11.825 --> 01:18:17.163
I killed that miserable
old fool.

01:18:17.231 --> 01:18:20.900
(Elle) How do you
like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

01:18:20.968 --> 01:18:23.502
I poisoned his fish heads.

01:18:26.974 --> 01:18:29.041
(Elle laughs)

01:18:33.847 --> 01:18:39.319
And I told him "To me,
the word of an old fool like you

01:18:39.386 --> 01:18:43.490
is worth less than nothing."

01:18:43.558 --> 01:18:45.092
(laughs)

01:18:48.530 --> 01:18:50.431
That's right.

01:18:50.498 --> 01:18:52.533
I killed your master.

01:18:52.600 --> 01:18:55.169
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

01:18:55.237 --> 01:18:57.905
With your own sword, no less.

01:18:57.973 --> 01:19:04.313
Which, in the very immediate
future, will become my sword.

01:19:06.416 --> 01:19:08.517
Bitch.

01:19:08.585 --> 01:19:09.918
You don't have a future.

01:19:40.017 --> 01:19:42.685
(yelling)

01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:55.064
(screaming)

01:20:00.371 --> 01:20:02.771
Fucking bitch!

01:20:03.872 --> 01:20:06.773
Fucking bitch!

01:20:14.948 --> 01:20:18.049
I'll kill you!
You're fuckin' dead!

01:20:20.485 --> 01:20:23.520
You bitch! You bitch!

01:20:23.588 --> 01:20:25.688
(moaning/screaming)

01:20:27.490 --> 01:20:30.292
I'll fucking kill you,
you bitch!

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:32.760
(hisses)

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:34.995
Oh, I'll get you!

01:20:37.298 --> 01:20:38.999
I'm gonna...

01:20:40.367 --> 01:20:43.302
Where are you?
Lemme fuckin' at you!

01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:45.437
(continues screaming)

01:20:45.505 --> 01:20:49.407
Where are you?
I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

01:20:49.475 --> 01:20:52.209
You're fucking dead!
You're dead!

01:20:52.277 --> 01:20:54.664
(continues screaming)

01:20:54.732 --> 01:20:57.748
Oh... shit!

01:20:59.376 --> 01:21:01.468
(screaming)

01:21:03.596 --> 01:21:07.382
(wind blowing)

01:21:20.114 --> 01:21:23.004
(♪ "Tu Mirá" by Lole y Manuel)

01:22:24.518 --> 01:22:26.811
(Beatrix) Like most men
who never knew their father,

01:22:26.879 --> 01:22:29.602
Bill collected father figures.

01:22:29.670 --> 01:22:32.626
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

01:22:32.694 --> 01:22:36.781
Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.

01:22:36.848 --> 01:22:40.931
He ran a brothel in Acuna,
Mexico, for over 50 years.

01:22:40.999 --> 01:22:43.292
His army, the Acuna Boys,

01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:46.980
made up of the fatherless
offspring of his whores,
ran Acuna.

01:22:47.048 --> 01:22:50.371
He ran the Acuna Boys.

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:53.563
Now, at the age of 80,

01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:57.083
it would be this retired
gentleman of leisure

01:22:57.151 --> 01:23:00.575
who could point me
in Bill's direction.

01:23:02.069 --> 01:23:04.529
Señor Esteban Vihaio?

01:23:05.957 --> 01:23:07.320
Yes.

01:23:07.388 --> 01:23:09.380
May I join you?

01:23:11.408 --> 01:23:14.564
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

01:23:14.632 --> 01:23:19.182
May I join you, Esteban?
Please.

01:23:22.641 --> 01:23:25.029
<i>¿Americana?</i>

01:23:25.097 --> 01:23:26.789
Yes.

01:23:26.857 --> 01:23:29.517
I speak a little Spanish,
if you prefer.

01:23:29.585 --> 01:23:33.172
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

01:23:33.239 --> 01:23:35.695
I haven't spoken it in a while,

01:23:35.763 --> 01:23:39.120
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

01:23:39.188 --> 01:23:42.044
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

01:23:42.112 --> 01:23:44.071
It's my pleasure to be
in the company

01:23:44.139 --> 01:23:45.999
of such a fine gentleman
as yourself.

01:23:46.067 --> 01:23:49.557
I must warn you, young lady,

01:23:49.621 --> 01:23:52.482
I am susceptible to flattery.

01:23:55.670 --> 01:23:57.696
How may I be of service to you?

01:24:06.108 --> 01:24:07.767
Where's Bill?

01:24:10.062 --> 01:24:12.685
Ahh.

01:24:12.752 --> 01:24:16.772
You must be Beatrix.

01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:20.097
I can see the attraction.

01:24:21.658 --> 01:24:24.848
I remember when Bill
was only five years old,

01:24:24.916 --> 01:24:26.975
I took him to the movies.

01:24:27.043 --> 01:24:30.797
It was a movie
starring Lana Turner.

01:24:30.865 --> 01:24:35.849
<i>The Postman Always Ring Twice,</i>
with John Garfield.

01:24:35.917 --> 01:24:39.174
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:42.298
Bill would begin compulsively
to suck his thumb

01:24:42.366 --> 01:24:44.822
to an obscene amount.

01:24:44.890 --> 01:24:50.549
And I knew from this very moment
this boy was a fool for blondes.

01:24:56.035 --> 01:24:58.136
Mmm.

01:24:58.204 --> 01:24:59.872
You know,

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:03.810
being a fool for a woman
such as yourself

01:25:03.878 --> 01:25:07.214
is always the right thing to do.

01:25:09.283 --> 01:25:14.254
If we had met
when I was back in business,

01:25:14.322 --> 01:25:18.925
you would have been
my number-one lady.

01:25:21.362 --> 01:25:25.598
Well, I'm flattered.
You goddamn well better be.

01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:31.870
This... I heard you
were driving a truck.

01:25:31.938 --> 01:25:34.873
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

01:25:34.941 --> 01:25:38.476
The Pussy died. Hmm.

01:25:40.712 --> 01:25:43.481
Bill shot you in the head, no?

01:25:43.548 --> 01:25:47.351
Yes.
Hmm.

01:25:47.419 --> 01:25:50.521
I would have been much nicer.

01:25:50.588 --> 01:25:52.923
I would have just cut your face.

01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.594
You must forgive me.

01:25:57.662 --> 01:26:01.031
Please... you have
a drink with me.

01:26:03.568 --> 01:26:07.804
Clara! (smooches)

01:26:09.306 --> 01:26:11.140
Coming.

01:26:12.609 --> 01:26:15.845
<i>Dos añejo.</i>

01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.880
(mumbles)

01:26:28.124 --> 01:26:29.625
<i>Gracias.</i>

01:26:34.531 --> 01:26:37.966
What were we talking about?

01:26:44.274 --> 01:26:46.141
Bill.

01:26:48.311 --> 01:26:52.047
Where's Bill?
Where's Bill.

01:26:52.115 --> 01:26:54.617
Yeah. Hmm.

01:26:54.684 --> 01:27:00.223
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

01:27:00.290 --> 01:27:04.059
I will draw you a map.

01:27:04.127 --> 01:27:08.030
Bill is like a son to me.

01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:12.069
Do you know why I help you?
No.

01:27:12.136 --> 01:27:15.573
Because he would want me to.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:18.008
Now, that I don't believe.

01:27:18.076 --> 01:27:20.511
Ahh.

01:27:20.579 --> 01:27:23.815
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

01:28:33.020 --> 01:28:34.687
Freeze, Mommy.

01:28:34.755 --> 01:28:36.755
Bang, bang! Oh!

01:28:36.823 --> 01:28:39.592
Oh! She got us, B.B.
Mommy got us.

01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:42.061
Oh, I'm dying.

01:28:42.129 --> 01:28:44.230
(groans) I'm dying.

01:28:46.933 --> 01:28:50.436
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.

01:28:51.905 --> 01:28:55.408
But little did
Quickdraw Kiddo know

01:28:55.475 --> 01:28:58.477
that little B.B.
was only playing possum,

01:28:58.545 --> 01:29:03.649
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

01:29:03.717 --> 01:29:05.851
I am pervious
to bullets, Mommy.

01:29:05.919 --> 01:29:09.521
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

01:29:09.589 --> 01:29:15.326
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

01:29:15.394 --> 01:29:21.132
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

01:29:23.001 --> 01:29:25.102
Bang, bang!

01:29:31.910 --> 01:29:36.181
You're dead, Mommy. So die.

01:29:37.150 --> 01:29:39.184
Oh!

01:29:41.755 --> 01:29:43.890
B.B.

01:29:46.827 --> 01:29:50.697
Oh! B.B....

01:29:50.765 --> 01:29:53.033
(grunts)

01:29:53.101 --> 01:29:56.203
I should've known.

01:29:56.271 --> 01:29:59.606
You are... the best.

01:30:06.481 --> 01:30:09.517
Oh, Mommy. Don't die.

01:30:09.585 --> 01:30:11.619
I was just playing.

01:30:16.993 --> 01:30:19.528
I know.

01:30:32.675 --> 01:30:35.743
I told her that you were asleep,

01:30:35.811 --> 01:30:40.647
but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

01:30:40.715 --> 01:30:44.884
And she asked me, "If Mommy's
been asleep since I was born,

01:30:44.952 --> 01:30:47.754
then how will she know
what I look like?"

01:30:47.821 --> 01:30:53.460
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

01:30:55.529 --> 01:30:57.964
That's what I said.

01:30:58.032 --> 01:31:02.702
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

01:31:02.770 --> 01:31:06.473
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:10.710
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

01:31:21.722 --> 01:31:25.457
Now, let me look at you.

01:31:25.525 --> 01:31:27.659
Oh.

01:31:30.930 --> 01:31:34.866
My, my, my, what a pretty
little girl you are.

01:31:34.934 --> 01:31:37.703
You're pretty too, Mommy.

01:31:42.976 --> 01:31:46.612
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.780
Mm-mm.

01:31:47.848 --> 01:31:50.516
Come on, shy girl.
Mm-mm.

01:31:50.584 --> 01:31:53.252
Come on.
You know what you said.

01:31:53.320 --> 01:31:56.755
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good.

01:31:56.823 --> 01:31:58.690
Come on.
Mm-mm.

01:31:58.758 --> 01:32:00.159
Yeah. Come on.

01:32:00.226 --> 01:32:02.794
I said... I said

01:32:02.862 --> 01:32:04.897
"You're the most
beautifulest woman

01:32:04.965 --> 01:32:09.268
I ever saw
in the whole wide world."

01:32:10.803 --> 01:32:14.373
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

01:32:14.441 --> 01:32:19.245
B.B., don't you think Mommy
has the prettiest hair

01:32:19.312 --> 01:32:21.214
in the whole wide world?

01:32:21.281 --> 01:32:25.151
Yes, I do.
Matter of fact,
it's better than pretty.

01:32:26.620 --> 01:32:31.224
What's better than pretty?
Mmm... Gorgeous.

01:32:31.292 --> 01:32:34.794
Very good. Gorgeous.

01:32:34.862 --> 01:32:38.198
Mommy is gorgeous.

01:32:38.266 --> 01:32:44.037
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

01:32:44.105 --> 01:32:47.074
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

01:32:47.141 --> 01:32:52.779
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

01:32:52.847 --> 01:32:56.818
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

01:32:56.885 --> 01:33:01.389
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

01:33:03.725 --> 01:33:06.660
I killed him.

01:33:06.728 --> 01:33:11.833
Emilio was her goldfish.
Emilio was my goldfiss.

01:33:11.901 --> 01:33:14.169
She came running into my room,

01:33:14.237 --> 01:33:16.639
holding the fish in her hand
and crying,

01:33:16.707 --> 01:33:19.642
"Daddy! Daddy! Emilio's dead."

01:33:21.412 --> 01:33:25.415
And I said,
"Really? That's so sad."

01:33:25.483 --> 01:33:27.650
"How did he die?"

01:33:27.718 --> 01:33:30.820
And what did you say?
I stepped on him.

01:33:30.888 --> 01:33:36.092
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:40.096
"I accidentally stepped on him."

01:33:40.164 --> 01:33:42.064
To which I queried,

01:33:42.132 --> 01:33:44.901
"And just how did
your foot accidentally

01:33:44.969 --> 01:33:47.703
find its way
into Emilio's fishbowl?"

01:33:47.771 --> 01:33:49.138
And she said, "No, no, no.

01:33:49.206 --> 01:33:52.041
Emilio was on the carpet
when I stepped on him."

01:33:52.109 --> 01:33:56.046
Mmm. The plot thickens.

01:33:56.114 --> 01:34:01.084
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

01:34:01.152 --> 01:34:04.922
And, Mommy, you would've
been so proud of her.

01:34:06.491 --> 01:34:08.892
She didn't lie.

01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:13.130
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl

01:34:13.198 --> 01:34:16.667
and put him on the carpet.

01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:22.340
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

01:34:22.407 --> 01:34:25.276
Flapping.

01:34:25.344 --> 01:34:28.781
And then you stomped on him.
Uh-huh.

01:34:28.848 --> 01:34:33.019
And when you lifted up
your foot,

01:34:33.087 --> 01:34:37.257
what was Emilio doing then?
Nothing.

01:34:37.325 --> 01:34:40.060
He stopped flapping,
didn't he?

01:34:42.463 --> 01:34:44.932
She told me later

01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.401
that the second
she lifted up her foot

01:34:47.469 --> 01:34:51.705
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

01:34:51.773 --> 01:34:56.844
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

01:34:56.912 --> 01:34:59.080
A fish flapping on the carpet,

01:34:59.147 --> 01:35:02.483
and a fish not flapping
on the carpet.

01:35:04.219 --> 01:35:06.086
So powerful,

01:35:06.154 --> 01:35:09.656
even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death

01:35:09.724 --> 01:35:11.791
knew what it meant.

01:35:13.727 --> 01:35:16.596
You loved Emilio,
didn't you?
Uh-huh.

01:35:16.663 --> 01:35:19.932
Well, I love Mommy, too.

01:35:21.268 --> 01:35:23.469
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

01:35:23.536 --> 01:35:27.406
You stomped on Mommy?
Worse.

01:35:27.473 --> 01:35:29.241
I shot Mommy.

01:35:29.309 --> 01:35:32.912
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

01:35:32.979 --> 01:35:34.647
I shot her for real.

01:35:34.715 --> 01:35:37.216
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

01:35:37.284 --> 01:35:42.055
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

01:35:42.122 --> 01:35:44.090
What I didn't know was,

01:35:44.158 --> 01:35:46.560
when I shot Mommy,
what would happen to me.

01:35:46.627 --> 01:35:50.463
What happened?
I was very sad.

01:35:52.666 --> 01:35:54.834
And that's when I learned

01:35:54.902 --> 01:35:59.974
some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

01:36:02.911 --> 01:36:08.349
What happened to Mommy?
Why don't you ask Mommy?

01:36:08.417 --> 01:36:11.585
You OK, Mommy? Did it hurt?

01:36:11.653 --> 01:36:13.721
No, sweetie.

01:36:15.491 --> 01:36:17.792
Doesn't hurt anymore.

01:36:23.432 --> 01:36:26.734
Did it make you sick?

01:36:26.802 --> 01:36:31.272
No. It made me sleep.

01:36:31.339 --> 01:36:34.375
That's why I haven't been
with you, B.B.
I've been asleep.

01:36:34.443 --> 01:36:37.745
But you're awake now, Mommy.
Right?

01:36:37.813 --> 01:36:40.915
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

01:36:40.983 --> 01:36:44.586
B.B., would you like Mommy
to watch a video with you

01:36:44.654 --> 01:36:46.321
before sleepy time?

01:36:46.389 --> 01:36:47.822
Uh-huh.

01:36:47.890 --> 01:36:51.659
Mommy, do you wanna
watch a video with me
before sleepy time?

01:36:51.727 --> 01:36:54.429
Oh, yeah! I would love to.

01:36:54.496 --> 01:36:56.898
Which one do you
wanna watch?
Shogun Assassin.

01:36:56.965 --> 01:36:59.767
No, B.B. Shogun Assassin
is too long.

01:36:59.835 --> 01:37:03.838
Mm-mm.
No, it's not.

01:37:03.905 --> 01:37:06.507
Well, then,

01:37:06.575 --> 01:37:09.009
I'll leave you ladies to it.

01:37:14.949 --> 01:37:20.387
(boy) When I was little,
my father was famous.

01:37:20.455 --> 01:37:24.892
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.

01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:28.129
And he was the shogun's
decapitator.

01:37:28.197 --> 01:37:33.468
He cut off the heads
of 131 lords.

01:37:33.536 --> 01:37:36.137
My father would
come home to Mother,

01:37:36.205 --> 01:37:38.173
and when he would see her

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:40.842
he would forget
about the killings.

01:37:40.909 --> 01:37:43.010
He wasn't scared of the shogun,

01:37:43.078 --> 01:37:46.080
but the shogun
was scared of him.

01:37:46.148 --> 01:37:48.849
Maybe that was the problem.

01:37:48.917 --> 01:37:51.885
One night, the shogun sent...

I was just admiring your sword.

01:40:16.426 --> 01:40:19.962
Quite a piece of work.

01:40:20.030 --> 01:40:24.867
Speaking of which,
how is Hanzo-san?

01:40:24.935 --> 01:40:28.304
He's good.

01:40:28.372 --> 01:40:31.407
Has his sushi
gotten any better?

01:40:34.578 --> 01:40:39.215
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

01:40:39.283 --> 01:40:41.384
It was easy.

01:40:41.452 --> 01:40:43.619
I just dropped your name, Bill.

01:40:43.687 --> 01:40:45.855
That'd do it.

I suppose the idea is
we cross Hanzo swords.

01:41:20.959 --> 01:41:24.261
Am I right?

01:41:24.329 --> 01:41:27.598
Well, it just so happens

01:41:27.665 --> 01:41:31.268
this hacienda has
its own private beach.

01:41:31.336 --> 01:41:33.437
And that private beach
just so happens

01:41:33.504 --> 01:41:35.539
to look particularly beautiful

01:41:35.607 --> 01:41:38.609
bathed in moonlight.

01:41:38.676 --> 01:41:41.479
And there just so happens
to be a full moon out tonight.

01:41:41.546 --> 01:41:44.448
So, sword fighter,

01:41:44.516 --> 01:41:48.319
if you want a sword fight,
that's where I suggest.

01:41:48.387 --> 01:41:52.690
But if you wanna be
old school about it

01:41:52.758 --> 01:41:56.327
- and you know
I'm all about old school -

01:41:56.395 --> 01:42:00.164
then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up
at sunrise

01:42:00.232 --> 01:42:02.533
like a couple
of real-life, honest...

01:42:04.436 --> 01:42:07.372
Now, if you don't settle down,

01:42:07.439 --> 01:42:09.774
I'm gonna have to put one
in your kneecap.

01:42:09.842 --> 01:42:13.078
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place
to get shot in.

01:42:15.182 --> 01:42:17.717
(laughs)

01:42:17.784 --> 01:42:20.353
I'm just fuckin' with you.

01:42:20.421 --> 01:42:25.459
Now, when it comes to you

01:42:25.526 --> 01:42:27.561
and us

01:42:29.163 --> 01:42:32.298
I have a few
unanswered questions.

01:42:32.366 --> 01:42:36.270
So, before this tale
of bloody revenge

01:42:36.337 --> 01:42:38.338
reaches its climax,

01:42:38.406 --> 01:42:41.175
I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

01:42:41.242 --> 01:42:44.211
and I want you
to tell me the truth.

01:42:44.278 --> 01:42:48.583
However, therein lies a dilemma.

01:42:48.650 --> 01:42:51.185
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

01:42:51.253 --> 01:42:54.589
I believe you are
truly and utterly

01:42:54.657 --> 01:42:56.591
incapable of telling the truth.

01:42:56.659 --> 01:43:01.029
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

01:43:01.097 --> 01:43:04.600
And when it comes
to the subject of me,

01:43:04.667 --> 01:43:07.236
I am truly and utterly

01:43:07.303 --> 01:43:11.474
incapable of believing
anything you say.

01:43:11.542 --> 01:43:13.409
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

01:43:13.477 --> 01:43:17.514
Well, it just so happens,

01:43:17.582 --> 01:43:19.684
I have a solution.

01:43:19.751 --> 01:43:22.186
Agh!
Gotcha!

01:43:22.254 --> 01:43:24.422
(grunting) God damn!

01:43:24.490 --> 01:43:26.858
(laughs)

01:43:26.926 --> 01:43:30.362
What the fuck did you
just shoot me with?

01:43:30.430 --> 01:43:34.066
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

01:43:34.134 --> 01:43:35.768
Don't touch it,

01:43:35.836 --> 01:43:37.804
or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

01:43:42.476 --> 01:43:44.877
What lies within that dart,

01:43:44.945 --> 01:43:48.815
just begging to course
its way through your veins

01:43:48.883 --> 01:43:50.784
is an incredibly potent

01:43:50.852 --> 01:43:53.420
and quite infallible
truth serum.

01:43:53.488 --> 01:43:56.623
I call it
"The Undisputed Truth."

01:43:56.691 --> 01:43:59.092
Twice as strong
as sodium pentothal,

01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:02.196
with no druggie aftereffects.

01:44:02.263 --> 01:44:07.968
Except for a slight wave
of euphoria. You feel it?

01:44:08.036 --> 01:44:10.604
Euphoria?
Yeah.

01:44:10.672 --> 01:44:13.774
No.
Too bad.

01:44:15.210 --> 01:44:17.578
As you know,

01:44:17.645 --> 01:44:21.015
I'm quite keen on comic books.

01:44:21.083 --> 01:44:24.718
Especially the ones
about superheroes.

01:44:24.786 --> 01:44:30.356
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes
fascinating.

01:44:30.424 --> 01:44:35.027
Take my favorite superhero,
Superman.

01:44:35.095 --> 01:44:38.197
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well drawn.

01:44:39.766 --> 01:44:41.466
Mmm.

01:44:41.534 --> 01:44:44.035
But the mythology...

01:44:44.103 --> 01:44:47.471
The mythology is not only
great, it's unique.

01:44:47.539 --> 01:44:51.809
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

01:44:51.877 --> 01:44:53.244
About two minutes.

01:44:53.312 --> 01:44:55.780
Just long enough for me
to finish my point.

01:44:55.848 --> 01:45:01.186
Now, a staple of
the superhero mythology is,

01:45:01.254 --> 01:45:04.156
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

01:45:04.224 --> 01:45:06.391
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,

01:45:06.459 --> 01:45:09.661
Spider-Man is actually
Peter Parker.

01:45:09.729 --> 01:45:11.629
When that character
wakes up in the morning,

01:45:11.697 --> 01:45:13.431
he's Peter Parker.

01:45:13.499 --> 01:45:18.670
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

01:45:18.738 --> 01:45:24.642
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

01:45:24.710 --> 01:45:27.478
Superman didn't become Superman.

01:45:27.546 --> 01:45:30.348
Superman was born Superman.

01:45:30.415 --> 01:45:34.652
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:38.256
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

01:45:38.324 --> 01:45:41.526
His outfit with the big red "S,"

01:45:41.594 --> 01:45:43.795
that's the blanket
he was wrapped in as a baby

01:45:43.863 --> 01:45:48.066
when the Kents found him.
Those are his clothes.

01:45:48.134 --> 01:45:51.536
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit -

01:45:51.604 --> 01:45:53.438
that's the costume.

01:45:53.506 --> 01:45:58.243
That's the costume Superman
wears to blend in with us.

01:45:59.679 --> 01:46:03.148
Clark Kent is how Superman
views us.

01:46:03.216 --> 01:46:06.584
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

01:46:06.652 --> 01:46:08.920
He's weak,

01:46:08.988 --> 01:46:11.923
he's unsure of himself,

01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:14.692
he's a coward.

01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:17.195
Clark Kent is
Superman's critique

01:46:17.262 --> 01:46:19.898
on the whole human race.

01:46:21.333 --> 01:46:26.104
Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plympton.

01:46:27.273 --> 01:46:29.441
Aso.

01:46:29.508 --> 01:46:31.843
The point emerges.

01:46:33.546 --> 01:46:37.015
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plympton.

01:46:37.083 --> 01:46:40.852
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:43.521
And every morning
when you woke up,

01:46:43.589 --> 01:46:45.957
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

01:46:46.025 --> 01:46:49.427
Oh, you can take
the needle out.

01:46:55.501 --> 01:46:57.836
Are you calling me a superhero?

01:46:57.904 --> 01:47:00.038
I'm calling you a killer.

01:47:00.106 --> 01:47:03.008
A natural-born killer.

01:47:03.076 --> 01:47:06.712
You always have been,
and you always will be.

01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:09.014
Moving to El Paso,

01:47:09.082 --> 01:47:12.551
working in
a used-record store,

01:47:12.619 --> 01:47:16.755
goin' to the movies with Tommy,
clipping coupons.

01:47:16.823 --> 01:47:18.624
That's you

01:47:18.692 --> 01:47:22.260
trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

01:47:22.328 --> 01:47:25.297
That's you tryin'
to blend in with the hive.

01:47:25.365 --> 01:47:28.666
But you're not a worker bee.

01:47:28.734 --> 01:47:31.502
You're a renegade killer bee.

01:47:31.570 --> 01:47:34.372
And no matter how much beer
you drank or barbecue you ate

01:47:34.439 --> 01:47:37.741
or how fat your ass got,

01:47:37.809 --> 01:47:41.712
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

01:47:44.115 --> 01:47:46.316
First question:

01:47:48.419 --> 01:47:53.789
did you really think your life
in El Paso was gonna work?

01:47:59.463 --> 01:48:01.531
No!

01:48:04.668 --> 01:48:07.603
But I would've had B.B.!

01:48:07.671 --> 01:48:10.406
Don't get me wrong.

01:48:10.474 --> 01:48:14.377
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

01:48:14.444 --> 01:48:17.080
But you are a killer.

01:48:21.118 --> 01:48:23.986
All those people you killed
to get to me

01:48:24.054 --> 01:48:26.455
felt damn good, didn't they?

01:48:28.592 --> 01:48:31.060
Yes.

01:48:31.128 --> 01:48:33.730
Every single one of them?

01:48:43.676 --> 01:48:46.578
Yes.

01:48:48.815 --> 01:48:51.417
That was the warmup round.

01:48:51.484 --> 01:48:56.922
Now comes the $64,000 question.

01:49:03.529 --> 01:49:07.131
Why did you run away from me
with my baby?

01:49:10.937 --> 01:49:14.339
Do you remember the last
assignment you sent me on?

01:49:14.406 --> 01:49:16.875
Of course.

01:49:16.943 --> 01:49:20.245
Lisa Wong.

01:49:20.313 --> 01:49:24.483
The morning I left, I was sick.

01:49:24.551 --> 01:49:28.954
On the plane, I threw up.

01:49:29.022 --> 01:49:32.891
So I started thinking

01:49:32.958 --> 01:49:35.093
maybe I was pregnant.

01:49:35.160 --> 01:49:36.927
"Easy to use.

01:49:36.995 --> 01:49:39.663
Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end
for five seconds."

01:49:41.766 --> 01:49:44.301
"Accurate results
in only 90 seconds."

01:49:44.368 --> 01:49:47.938
"You can read the results
as soon as the line appears
in the window."

01:49:48.006 --> 01:49:49.073
(sighs)

01:49:49.140 --> 01:49:51.542
(clock ticking)

01:50:24.277 --> 01:50:25.377
Fuck.

01:50:25.445 --> 01:50:27.546
(Beatrix) What I didn't know

01:50:27.613 --> 01:50:29.548
was that somewhere
on my journey

01:50:29.615 --> 01:50:31.783
I had been spotted.

01:50:31.851 --> 01:50:35.320
With me in L.A.,
it didn't take Lisa Wong long

01:50:35.387 --> 01:50:37.821
to send an assassin of her own.

01:50:37.889 --> 01:50:40.791
(doorbell)
(Beatrix) Hello,
can I help you?

01:50:40.859 --> 01:50:43.627
Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager
of the hotel.

01:50:43.695 --> 01:50:46.096
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

01:50:46.163 --> 01:50:49.132
Oh, that's nice. Um...

01:50:49.199 --> 01:50:51.367
Can you just leave it
by the door?

01:51:03.745 --> 01:51:05.112
You pretty good
with that shotgun?

01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:07.114
Not that I have to be
at this range,

01:51:07.182 --> 01:51:08.949
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

01:51:09.017 --> 01:51:11.819
Well, guess what, bitch.
I'm better than Annie Oakley,

01:51:11.886 --> 01:51:13.687
and I got you
right in my sight.

01:51:13.755 --> 01:51:15.656
I could blow
your fuckin' head off.

01:51:15.724 --> 01:51:19.794
Not before I put one
right between your eyes,
so let's talk.

01:51:21.397 --> 01:51:23.831
Karen...

01:51:25.534 --> 01:51:27.869
I just found out

01:51:27.937 --> 01:51:29.905
right now

01:51:29.972 --> 01:51:36.045
not a moment before you blew
a hole through the door

01:51:36.113 --> 01:51:40.316
that I'm pregnant.
What is this?

01:51:40.384 --> 01:51:43.287
On the floor by the door

01:51:43.354 --> 01:51:46.456
is a strip that says
I'm pregnant.

01:51:46.524 --> 01:51:48.992
Bullshit.

01:51:49.060 --> 01:51:52.629
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

01:51:52.697 --> 01:51:55.799
This time

01:51:55.867 --> 01:51:58.736
you're 100 percent wrong.

01:52:00.171 --> 01:52:03.807
I'm the deadliest woman
in the world.

01:52:03.875 --> 01:52:06.143
But right now

01:52:06.211 --> 01:52:09.580
I'm just scared shitless
for my baby.

01:52:09.648 --> 01:52:12.383
Please.

01:52:12.450 --> 01:52:14.918
Just look at the strip.

01:52:16.955 --> 01:52:18.722
Please!

01:52:20.058 --> 01:52:24.495
Stay where you are
and don't move.

01:52:42.014 --> 01:52:44.215
I don't know what
this fuckin' shit means.

01:52:44.283 --> 01:52:46.684
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

01:52:58.530 --> 01:53:00.198
"Easy to use."

01:53:00.265 --> 01:53:04.803
"Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:06.504
Blue means pregnant.

01:53:06.572 --> 01:53:09.841
I'll read it myself,
thank you.

01:53:16.215 --> 01:53:20.818
Oh, OK. Say I were
to believe you. What then?

01:53:20.886 --> 01:53:23.454
Just go home.

01:53:25.357 --> 01:53:27.425
I'll do the same.

01:53:32.231 --> 01:53:34.466
(opens door)

01:53:47.012 --> 01:53:48.646
Congratulations.

01:53:52.284 --> 01:53:55.085
Before that strip turned blue

01:53:55.153 --> 01:53:58.589
I was a woman. I was your woman.

01:53:58.657 --> 01:54:02.059
I was a killer
who killed for you.

01:54:02.127 --> 01:54:03.861
Before that strip turned blue,

01:54:03.929 --> 01:54:08.432
I would've jumped a motorcycle
onto a speeding train.

01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:11.736
For you.

01:54:11.804 --> 01:54:15.172
But once that strip turned blue

01:54:15.240 --> 01:54:18.743
I could no longer
do any of those things.

01:54:18.811 --> 01:54:21.279
Not anymore.

01:54:21.347 --> 01:54:24.816
Because I was gonna be a mother.

01:54:27.019 --> 01:54:29.888
Can you understand that?

01:54:31.991 --> 01:54:34.693
Yes.

01:54:34.761 --> 01:54:40.032
But why didn't you tell me then,
instead of now?

01:54:40.099 --> 01:54:42.467
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

01:54:42.535 --> 01:54:44.436
And I didn't want that.

01:54:44.504 --> 01:54:47.506
Not your decision to make.

01:54:47.574 --> 01:54:49.808
Yes.

01:54:49.876 --> 01:54:54.046
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

01:54:54.114 --> 01:54:58.851
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

01:54:58.919 --> 01:55:02.155
But with you
she would've been born

01:55:02.223 --> 01:55:05.091
into a world she shouldn't have.

01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:09.729
I had to choose.

01:55:09.797 --> 01:55:11.864
I chose her.

01:55:14.368 --> 01:55:17.170
You know, five years ago,

01:55:17.237 --> 01:55:20.106
if I had to make a list
of impossible things

01:55:20.173 --> 01:55:22.141
that could never happen,

01:55:22.209 --> 01:55:24.310
you performing
a coup de grâce on me

01:55:24.377 --> 01:55:27.746
by bustin' a cap in my crown

01:55:30.317 --> 01:55:33.118
would've been right
at the top of the list.

01:55:34.687 --> 01:55:37.890
I'd have been wrong,
wouldn't I?

01:55:37.958 --> 01:55:39.825
I'm sorry.

01:55:39.893 --> 01:55:43.195
Was that a question?

01:55:43.263 --> 01:55:45.964
Of impossible things
that could never happen,

01:55:46.032 --> 01:55:50.168
yes, in this instance,
you would've been wrong.

01:55:50.236 --> 01:55:52.136
Well?

01:55:52.204 --> 01:55:54.839
When you never came back,

01:55:54.906 --> 01:55:58.075
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,

01:55:58.143 --> 01:56:01.079
or somebody else,
had killed you.

01:56:01.146 --> 01:56:04.382
Oh! And for the record,

01:56:04.450 --> 01:56:07.452
letting somebody think
somebody they love is dead

01:56:07.519 --> 01:56:11.322
when they're not
is quite cruel.

01:56:14.126 --> 01:56:18.729
I mourned you for three months.

01:56:18.797 --> 01:56:23.134
And in the third month
of mourning you

01:56:23.202 --> 01:56:25.703
I tracked you down.

01:56:25.771 --> 01:56:27.838
I wasn't tryin'
to track you down.

01:56:27.906 --> 01:56:33.277
I was tryin' to track down
the fucking assholes
I thought killed you.

01:56:33.345 --> 01:56:36.848
So I find you.

01:56:36.915 --> 01:56:39.116
And what do I find?

01:56:39.184 --> 01:56:42.587
Not only are you not dead,

01:56:42.654 --> 01:56:47.224
you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

01:56:49.094 --> 01:56:51.729
And you're pregnant.

01:56:54.832 --> 01:56:57.267
I... overreacted.

01:57:05.842 --> 01:57:09.745
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

01:57:09.813 --> 01:57:12.147
I didn't say I was
gonna explain myself.

01:57:12.215 --> 01:57:14.650
I said I was gonna
tell you the truth.

01:57:14.717 --> 01:57:20.022
But if that's too cryptic,
let's get literal.

01:57:21.692 --> 01:57:24.194
I'm a killer.

01:57:24.262 --> 01:57:27.598
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

01:57:27.666 --> 01:57:30.634
And there are consequences

01:57:30.702 --> 01:57:34.972
to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.775
You experienced some of them.

01:57:41.114 --> 01:57:44.717
Was my reaction really
that surprising?

01:57:44.784 --> 01:57:48.988
Yes. It was.

01:57:50.991 --> 01:57:54.727
Could you do what you did?

01:57:54.795 --> 01:57:58.531
Of course you could.

But I never thought
you would, or could,

01:58:02.737 --> 01:58:05.038
do that to me.

01:58:05.106 --> 01:58:08.107
I'm really sorry, Kiddo,

01:58:08.175 --> 01:58:10.409
but you thought wrong.

01:58:16.582 --> 01:58:20.719

Why didn't you tell me?

01:59:16.541 --> 01:59:18.776
I don't know.

01:59:21.012 --> 01:59:23.881
Because I'm

01:59:23.949 --> 01:59:26.617
a bad person.

01:59:26.685 --> 01:59:28.753
No.

01:59:30.722 --> 01:59:33.791
You're not a bad person.

01:59:33.859 --> 01:59:36.794
You're a terrific person.

01:59:36.862 --> 01:59:39.297

Mr. and Mrs. America

Let's go to press. Flash.

02:02:28.291 --> 02:02:31.026
Do you have a magpie
in your home?

02:02:31.094 --> 02:02:33.461
If you do,
you are most fortunate.

02:02:33.529 --> 02:02:37.198
The magpie is the most
charming bird in all the world.

02:02:37.266 --> 02:02:39.734
He is the best friend
a farmer ever had.

02:02:39.802 --> 02:02:42.870
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.

02:02:42.938 --> 02:02:44.872
And always remember,

02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:47.475
the magpie deserves
your respect.
