00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Shall we take the kids out for dessert? I think they will like it.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.000
Don't come here again.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.000
Why?

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.000
My world and your world are different.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Good luck.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If someone sees Dong's body in this condition, we'll be in trouble.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I think we should hurry and cremate Dong's body. 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.000
But I think I think we shouldn't burn it yet.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.000
Maybe someone will take this opportunity to frame you again.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.000
Wait another seven days.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.000
If relatives or someone else doesn't complain about Dong's death, 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.000
until that day, we can burn the body. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Do you think Li has something to do with the death of a worker?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.000
I have brought you the news. How you'll handle it

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.000
is up to you.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.000
We will use this to destroy his credibility

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
and remove Big Brother from the head position of the Five Dragons Association.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Doing this is like bringing enemies to our home.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.000
I'm really curious

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
what method Mr. Ma will use to deal with Madam Li and Dong's body.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Madam. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
I let the servant prepare the car for you. Let's go.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
The body is finally getting burned.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I'm scared that his relatives will show up every day. 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:20.000
Or someone will suspect Dong's death again. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And everything is fine now, right?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Are you going to Dong's funeral?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Why are you and Nuan dressing like this?

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.000
Oh, it's Dong's funeral.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.000
Madam and I want to participate the funeral as well. 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.000
We had lived together here for a long time. It's his last day.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
I'd like to send him as well.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Are you ready?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Sir. 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Are you coming with me? Didn't you say you let me handle this?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
At first, I thought I wouldn't go.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.000
But Chan said that I should go to make merit for Dong.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Well, last night, I dreamed that the spirit of Dong came here howling.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000
His face was furious as if he wanted to say something.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.000
What did he want to say?

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:23.000
He would have wanted to say someone intentionally killed him

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
and wanted me to help catch the culprit. 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Dong stole things and ran away and drowned.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.000
Nobody killed him. 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Stop blaming me. 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Madam. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000
I haven't accused you of killing Dong. 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Don't be scared beforehand. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
What I said was just a dream.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Hey, enough. Stop arguing.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Let's hurry to the temple and make merit for Dong. 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Everyone would be wait for us by now.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Everyone?

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Yes, everyone.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Shall we go?

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Sir, let's go.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:30.000
(Prayer)

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
The prayer has finished.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:03.000
I'll let the staff take Dong's body for cremation now. 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000
But according to Thai tradition, the dead's face must be washed first.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Mr. Song is Chinese, so you may not know.

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.000
Nuan, tell the staff to open the coffin.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Don't open it. 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Why?

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Dong's body had been dead for several days.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000
It would have swollen and bloated.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000
It must be ugly to look at. 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It's fine to me. 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000
So we can learn that

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.000
Nothing stays forever. 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
You don't have to do it actually. Though it's a custom, 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.000
but if it's inconvenient or inappropriate, then don't do it.

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000
So do as the monk said.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000
Let the staff carry his body to do the cremation.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Stop. 

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Don't move the body anywhere.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
What is this, Mr. Ma, Aunt Xiao Tong?

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Why are you interfering this?

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Yes, why do you bring the police here?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Ma told me 

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000
that a worker from Song Family's had died.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000
But there's something weird relevant to Li.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000
So he wanted us to witnesses and find out the truth.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000
But I still don't believe that much, Big Brother.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
I just want to see it with my own eyes

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000
what exactly happened.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000
I'm sorry, Big Brother, 

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000
that I didn't tell you before.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
The person who died was a relative of my worker.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000
He suspected the death of his nephew. 

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.000
So I have to take him here. 

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
My name is Zhan, an elder brother of Dong's mom.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Dong was close to the relatives on his father's side.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000
When his parents died, everyone parted.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.000
I just found out that he was dead.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000
We've been looking for Dong's relatives for several days.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.000
Why are you showing up now?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Did you secretly accept money from someone to lander us?

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:52.000
As I said, 

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
my worker heard that

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000
before his death, 

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000
Dong had a fight with Li.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
So I need to take the police to do an autopsy first

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
to see what the real cause of death is. 

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Was it an accident or a murder?

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Police officers. 

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Mr. Zhan, come and see if this is your relative's body. 

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000
If it is correct, he will be sent for an autopsy to determine the cause of death.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Open it. 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
I thought it might be like this.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000
So I prepare a backup plan.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000
The coffin must be made of thin wood.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000
So the rats can eat the corpse.

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000
The face is ruined like this. Can you still confirm that this is your relative?

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
This is not Dong's body. 

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
What do you mean?

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
You can get caught by the police if you talk nonsense. 

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:41.000
Look at it. 

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000
There are may grey hairs. 

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.000
Dong was still young. Why did he got so many grey hairs?

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Another thing, 

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.000
He had been taken out of the water several days ago.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:55.000
The body must be soft and deteriorating, but what is this?

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:57.000
The skin looks like a normal dead. 

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
If it's not Dong's body, whose body is this?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
Anyway, I need to bring the body back to check to see what happened.

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.000
If there's a progress, I will immediately inform you all.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
How could something like this happen?

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Didn't you say you couldn't find his relatives?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Then why did his relative show up today?

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Or do you have anything to do with this, Li?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Where is Dong's body?

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000
I don't know.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000
You really don't know?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Previously, you still let Jia watch over the body there.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Watching over the corpse or doing what?

00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:37.000
Shut your mouth.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Don't think I don't know

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000
that Mr. Ma brought the police today because you told him the news. 

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Hoping he will get me and my son, right?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Is it true, Chan?

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Why would I do that?

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000
Everyone knows what kind of man Mr. Ma is.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000
He is trying to destroy the Song family's reputation.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
The workers gossiped about Dong's death themselves. 

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Mr. Ma heard it and made a big deal.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000
That's true. 

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Ma hopes to destroy the reputation of me and the Song family many times.

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:24.000
And if he succeeds this time, 

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.000
he will probably use this reason to remove me from the leader position of the association. 

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
You two listen carefully.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000
If the officials know who got involved in Dong's death, 

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:46.000
I won't help any of you at all.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
And if it affects the Five Dragons Association, 

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000
I will punish that person until the very end.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Is it you?

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Did you tell Mr. Ma to mess with this?

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Why did you do that?

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Do you want to borrow someone else's hand to get rid of Madam and Tian for me?

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Please, don't do it again.

00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.000
I told you that I never wanted anything that wasn't mine.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000
Please stop. 

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Do you know how many people will suffer from what you did?

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000
The person who is in trouble is a murderer.

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:56.000
Why are you protecting them?

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000
You tell me to stop doing this for you? I can't.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000
I will do everything to make you the leader of the clan instead of Tian.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Mr. Yang, drink something sweet here.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000
Even if I drink a jar, it won't help me. 

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Dong's death is now a big mess.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000
Both the officials and people from the association are involved in this matter. 

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000
I can't predict how this will end.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
We won't be able to do anything.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
We just have to wait. 

00:18:08.700 --> 00:18:10.000
The authorities have now come in to handled it.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:15.000
Once we find Dong's body, we'll soon know the cause of death.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Since the body is gone, everyone now focuses on Madam Li. 

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Because earlier, she told Aunt Jia to sleep at the temple to watch over Dong's body.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
But we still don't know the truth.

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:30.000
I think we shouldn't judge anything yet. 

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.000
How is Tian now?

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Before his death, 

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.000
Dong had a fight with Li.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.000
This is not Dong's body. 

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
If it's not Dong's body, whose body is this?

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Tian.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Yang.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
I thought you were going to see Bua.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.000
So I waited for you there. 

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Bua and I are worried about you.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Thank you.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
If I tell you not to feel stressed, not to think too much, 

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
you probably can't do it, right?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000
And if I tell you to tell me everything, 

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000
I don't know if you want to do it or not.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
So what should I do, Tian?

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000
How can I help you?

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Yang.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I don't know what to do.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
I'm scared, I'm so scared.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000
The story is like this because of me.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Dong died because of my secret.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Calm down, Tian. Calm down first.

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:01.000
I should have been known since that day.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000
When Dong behaved badly towards me and Mother defended him.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.000
It might not be what you think.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.000
It is.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000
I know it. 

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Actually…

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
Actually…

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:25.000
I'm...

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:32.000
I'm...

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Don't say anything. 

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Don't say anything. 

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
Don't think about anything.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
No matter what happens, 

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:56.000
No matter what you are, 

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000
I will be by your side. 

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
I'll find a way to help you.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000
it's alright. 

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Thanks a lot, Yang.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Mother.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Come in. 

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
What's the matter?

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
I'm not happy at all.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Dong's body disappeared like this.

00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.000
Everyone thought that you have something to do with it.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Mother. 

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Dong died because he knew my secret, right?

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:28.000
And the body vanished like this, 

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000
it's connected, right?

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Don't worry.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.000
This is not about you. 

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000
But we should consider what Aunt Chan said.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Everything seems to fit.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
People are thinking of me badly right now.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000
Whether it's Chan or Mr. Ma.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
They all want to take advantage of Dong's death.

00:23:54.600 --> 00:23:57.000
Using this to attack us to become the leader of the association. 

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:03.000
And now your father is not satisfied with me and blame me too.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:07.000
If you don't trust me too, I'll probably have no one left.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Mother. 

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
I didn't suspect or didn't trust you.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
But I don't want anyone to die because of my secret.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Now the police come in.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Let them take care of everything.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000
We will know the truth soon. 

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000
If the worker's body being switched is true, 

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:51.000
It's suspicious why the worker's body should be hidden.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000
What exactly is it?

00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.000
Mr. Ma hurriedly called mt to see Dong's body at the temple.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000
He seemed to know from the beginning that there was something strange about it. 

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Ma waited for the moment to attack Big Brother

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
to claim the head position of the association for a long time.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000
He hopes we can support him. 

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000
I've heard that the Mr. Song had been blaming Madam Li and Madam Chan.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:23.000
That means he doesn't trust his two wives as well.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
So which side should we choose?

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Mr. Song or Mr. Ma.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
In this situation, we should not choose a side.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000
We should be neutral.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Hey, don't worry. Order as you want. 
265
00:26:51,500 --&gt; 00:25:54,000
I'm rich today. It's my treat. 

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Who wants money? Money!

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
That's...

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Dong's uncle.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000
No need to hurry. 

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Why is he wealthy now?

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
If everyone knows that you were the one who told Mr. Ma, 

00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.000
we'll be in trouble. 

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.000
But if Ma helps expose Madam Li and Jia,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.000
they'll be in trouble, not us.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Now the police interfere, 

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:36.000
they must prove if that the body is Dong's. 

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
If it isn't, they must find the body until it is found. 

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.000
If we get the body and let the cop prove it, 

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000
we'll know what they're trying to hide, right?

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Correct.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Madam Li and Old Jia won't get away this time. 

00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Auntie, come take a look here.

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.000
What's wrong?

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.000
Well, hurry. 

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:14.000
Why are you shouting?

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:15.000
Follow me.

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:18.000
What's wrong with you? I'm going to fall down. 

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000
What kind of mushrooms are these? Why are they blooming so much?

00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:28.000
Right? I've been picking vegetables and bamboo shoots here for ten years.

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.000
I've never seen anything like this.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
So let's get them all. Quickly.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000
So many of them. 

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.000
I made herbal soup for you.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Please drink it. 

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
What should I do next?

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Don't be afraid, Madam. 

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000
If something happens, I will be responsible for it alone.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Jia. 

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000
So how did you handle Dong's body?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000
I was in a hurry, so I hid it around here. 

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.000
But don't worry, I'll go back and deal with it again soon.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Did the mushrooms from Dong's body grow this much?

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Let's collect more. 

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Oh, Auntie Jia.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Are you coming to pick mushrooms as well?

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000
It's delicious, right? We have already collected one round.

00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.000
We liked the mushrooms so much that we come back to collect them again.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Are you guys picking mushrooms to eat?

00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Yes, this mushroom is plump and delicious.

00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.000
The people in the kitchen were really impressed.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:22.000
You don't need to do. I'll do it for you.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Move, let me do it. 

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Come quickly.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000
Chen.

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Yes, Aunt Jia.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
What are you guys doing here?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Mr. Song ordered me to build more bunkers.

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:41.000
Why does he want it here?

00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.000
He wants the bunkers to be hidden around.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
I'll off to work. 

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Let's go to work. 

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Build a bunker?

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.000
Then it will take a long time to finish.

00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:01.000
Yes, a lot of workers must be hanging around in the area. 

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:03.000
It wouldn't be that easy to dig up Dong's body.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
The people in the kitchen collecting mushrooms and the workers are there. 

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
You should go talk to Mr. Song build the bunkers somewhere else.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.000
No.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Instead of the digging up the body quietly, 

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000
Chan will turn to focus on what we did to that area. 

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000
It will get worse.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
But we have to find a way to get rid of the body.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Thank you for bringing the snacks for me. 

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.000
Take some fruit as a gift for your father when you go back. 

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Pin. 

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000
Yes？

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Is anything bothering you?

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.000
You can tell me. 

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000
Where are you going, Yang?

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Let's talk.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.000
It's okay. 

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.000
I don't want be a third wheeler. 

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.000
I'm leaving. 

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.000
The two of us are talking and having fun.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.000
No one interrupts us. 

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
I wish you a happy afternoon. 

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Being with my fiancé makes me happy already. 

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:27.000
I forget that you don't care about love

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.000
because it's nonsense.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Love is not nonsense. It's the people. 

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Yes, it's me who is nonsense.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Pin.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Have you heard about the folk tale titled Butterfly Lovers?

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Zhu Yingtai fell in love with a young man

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
but she was forced to marry another man. 

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:11.000
When the young man found out, he was heartbroken and died later. 

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.000
The day that Zhu Yingtai had to get married, 

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:17.000
she paid her respects at the grave of the man she loved.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Then after that, she threw herself into the grave to commit suicide.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Tian. 

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Why did you tell me this story?

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
I just want to know

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000
if you have your own young man?

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Tian.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Pin, don't you feel sorry for that young man?

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Yes, I do. 

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
But I also have to think about my father's feelings.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:01.000
I know that

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
but you have to think about your own feelings as well. 

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Would you exchange your whole life's happiness with someone you don't love?

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Think about it carefully.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Is marrying me

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000
the only way to get the palace back from my mother?

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Tian.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000
I don't have dignity at all, do I?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000
That I have to marry for money.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000
It's not like that.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.000
I understand that you have a duty.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
For me, you are grateful to your family.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000
But I want you to think well. 

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.000
Choose well between love and duty.

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000
True love is rare.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000
But I believe that you've found one. 

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000
I don't want you to lose your love.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:08.000
Like Zhu Yingtai jumping into the grave to follow the man she loved.

00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:12.000
Tian, thank you very much.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000
You are right.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:19.000
I should not solve problems with marriage.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.000
There must be another way.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000
I should earn money to redeem the palace mortgaged to Aunt Li.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000
I can be your good brother and friend to you.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
But I can't be your good lover.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Try to figure out who that person is.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
I believe that you have met him. 

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Fight for the one you love.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Yes, he's a good man. 

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
When I am next to him, 

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000
I'm happy and forget all the problems.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Yang must be happy.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Tian.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
I haven't said a word that it was Yang.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Yang.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Pin, Pin. 

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Wait for me. 

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Pin.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:02.000
You are so rude, eavesdropping on other people.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:07.000
You are smiling?

00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.000
I smile because I'm happy

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.000
that you have decided not to marry Tian.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Why are you glad?

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
You want this to happen, right?

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Because you've always been interfering.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
I'm really glad

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000
that you will fight for the man you love.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
I will fight for the one I love, not you. 

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:32.000
A false claim. 

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
So disappointed.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
You're walking away already. 

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Let's fight together.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Don't worry.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
I definitely won't let you face your problems alone.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Anyway, 

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:04.000
If you have to redeem the palace from Madam Li, how much money do you need?

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Hundreds of thousands.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Before I refuse my father's request for marriage,

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000
I need to find a way to get back the palace.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Otherwise, he wouldn't agree for sure.

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
We'll work together to find a way out.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000
This young man won't definitely die alone with a broken heart. 

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Oh. 

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Bua.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000
Yes, I'm here, Mr. Tian.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
What are these that you're carrying?

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.000
I want you to teach me how to make shadow puppets

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000
that you used to tell me when I was a kid.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Do you want to see it again?

00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.000
No. 

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000
I promised my friend that I would take them to the movies.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000
But this is a war time, so I can't do that.

00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:38.000
So I'm going to do the shadow puppet instead.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000
How old are your friends?

00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:46.000
One is seven years old, another is nine.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.000
The other…

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
is twenty years old.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000
This one is unfriendly.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
His face is always sad. I don't know why he is suffering.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
I haven't seen you smile like this in a long time.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
I want to get to know your friends too.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Draw it like that. 

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Keep it close together. So when you cut it, you'll be able to see it clearly.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Yes. 

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Sir. 

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:09.000
Drink some herbal medicine.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
You'll feel relaxed.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Anything that you can take a break from, 

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.000
please stop for a while.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Or you'll be sick.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.000
The doctor often warned that you should rest a lot.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Thank you.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
I want to take a break as well. 

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Letting Tian take care of all businesses

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000
if he's ready.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000
But now our home is in so many chaos.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Dong's body was replaced. 

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000
I don't know if Li was involved in it. 

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
And Chan too. 

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:13.000
I don't know if she told Ma about our family matter. 

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
I really don't understand

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
why they did that.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000
There must be only one reason

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000
as a driving force that can make a mother

00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000
do anything big like that.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
It is for children.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
About Dong's body that had been switched, 

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000
If Li is behind this, 

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000
that means that she is involved in Dong's death.

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:00.000
I will let the authorities fully punish her.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:02.000
As for Chan, 

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
if she was the one who told Ma about this,

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
I wouldn't let her get away as well. 

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
She knows that Ma is ready to stab me from the back any time

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000
and she still decides to do that.

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Apart from Zhang, 

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.000
I never trusted anyone again.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
I ended up like today probably because of karma

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.000
that I put pressure on Zhang. 

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
I said he was a homosexual that he had to kill himself.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Zhang.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Zhang, Zhang.

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:25.000
Zhang.

00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:34.000
One day, I wish you feel the pain that I had.

00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:35.000
Zhang.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Zhang, Zhang.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000
Ten years have passed.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
I still feel guilty

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.000
that I judged him like that. 

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000
No matter how many years have passed, 

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:01.000
that feeling of guilt never faded.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000
I understand you.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000
But you did your best.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000
But not good enough.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Otherwise he wouldn't have died.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:18.000
If there's anything I can atone for my mistake, 

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.000
I am ready to do it.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000
The rest of my life, 

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.000
I just want only peace in our family. 

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:53.000
Mei, Fu.

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.000
Tian.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
I told you not to come here again.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Why can't I?

00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.000
I didn't come to see you. I came here for Mei and Fu.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
But they are my siblings.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
I don't allow it. Go back now.

00:46:12.200 --> 00:46:15.000
I won't. I made a promise with them already.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Jiu, don't chase Tian away.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Please, he brought us a movie. I want to see a movie.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Please, Jiu. Please. 

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Why are you such a mean brother?

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Once upon a time, 

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
In a Mount Emei, 

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
There is Bai Suzhen.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000
She is Madam White Snake who has practiced disciplined training for thousand years.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000
She transformed herself into a human.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Ta-da / Whoa. 

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:29.000
When Madam White Snake came to live in the human world,

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000
she fell in love with a young man.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000
Tian, what about the young man?

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Wait a minute.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000
I can't hold it in both hands. 

00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:53.000
Jiu, help Tian hold it.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Quickly. 

00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:56.000
Hurry, Jiu. 

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Although the love between Bai Suzhen and her lover had many obstacles, 

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
they can get through them until the end.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:39.000
And finally, Bai Suzhen married the man she loved

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:41.000
and lived with him happily.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Don't come here again in the future. 

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
I beg you. 

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Why?

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000
I already told you that this is not your place. 

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Madam White Snake

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000
was imprisoned in a pagoda eventually

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
because she didn't know her place, right?

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
But that's just a legend.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Somehow it was just a story. 

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Perhaps Madam White Snake

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:09.000
lived in the human world with the man she loved.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000
You really don't listen to anyone. 

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
I'll listen to you if you have enough reasons.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:23.000
If you see me here again next time, you can scold me then.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Thank you for sending me. 

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000
The torch.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Sir. 

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Good you're here, I'm going to find you at home.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:14.000
This is your sister's medicine.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.000
Thank you, sir. 

00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:21.000
Since Mei got your medicine, she's getting better. 

00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Then remember this well that your sister

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:27.000
depend on Mr. Ma's medicine. 

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Otherwise, she would have died long ago.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
You should be very grateful.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Don't say that. 

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000
Jiu

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
is already a grateful man.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Right?

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Would you mind sharing the formula of the medicine you gave to my sister?

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
So I can know exactly what medicine it is. 

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
She's not getting better taking other medicine. 

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
But her condition is back to normal completely when she takes yours. 

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
The next time when Mei suffers a relapse, I don't need to bother you again.

00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000
I can't give it to you.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
You have to bother me again and again. 

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Get ready.

00:52:18.000 --> 00:52:22.000
I will have a job for you soon. 

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Hey.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000
What's the matter again?

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Just now I saw you talking to…

00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.000
Are you spying on me?

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Not like that.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:59.000
I forgot my torch so I come back and saw it. 

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Did you know that that man was a bad guy?

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Don't mess with him, okay?

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Thanks for warning me. 

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000
But he is rich and powerful.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
I have to depend on him.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
So don't rely on him next time. 

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.000
People like me don't have much choice.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Sometimes I had to do it.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
The things that good people don't do.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Then next time, 

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000
let me be your choice too. 

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000
If you are in trouble, come to me. 

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:42.000
My father can help you.

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Who is your father?

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
You shouldn't know about it. 

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.000
You'll say that I'm rich and you're poor again.

00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.000
The two of us are different.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000
Just remember that 

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000
I can help you.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000
The two of us can be friends and that's enough.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000
You're so good. 

00:54:41.400 --> 00:54:45.000
Look at my work. My stitches can't compare to you. 

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.000
Madam, you just start practicing embroidery.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000
Yours is pretty already. If you do it more often, you will be better at it. 

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Tian must be very happy that you embroider the shirt for him. 

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:04.000
I intend to give him on the day of taking the position of the association leader. 

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Are you embroidering a shirt for Tian to wear on the day of the taking the position?

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.000
I'm afraid he won't have a chance to use it. 

00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.000
What do you mean?

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Do you think that Yang will take the position of association leader instead of Tian?

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
I didn't say that.

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.000
Tian is perfect without flaws.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
It must have been him only to inherit the position. 

00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:34.000
Right?

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Yes? So is there still Mr. Tian's secret or not?

00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:40.000
Hey, I'm sarcastic.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Madam Chan. 

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
You're living in the same house. Please don't argue.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000
Don't teach me. 

00:55:49.300 --> 00:55:51.000
Do you think you're a good person?

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:55.000
You act like you're neutral, despite the fact that you are on Madam's side.

00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:56.000
Chan. 

00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000
If you are not happy to see other people happy, 

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
just close your eyes and walks past us.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Why would you want a fight here?

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:10.000
I'm not good at closing my eyes. It's someone else's favorite job.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Just wait and see, if the police can find out that the body is not Dong, 

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
there must be a search for Dong's body. 

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
This time, you'll know the truth.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:49.000
Why does Mr. Ma let us watch over these corpses?

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000
He said they were important corpses.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Just do it. Don't complain.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Mr. Ma is very cautious, sending two subordinates to watch it. 

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.000
That warehouse is also near the temple hall and the undertaker's house.

00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000
Both monks and villagers are there. 

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000
I can't find a right time yet. 

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:25.000
That's bad. 

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
If we let it go on, we'll be in trouble.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000
What should we do?

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:35.000
I will find a way to handle that body. 

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
I must prepare to be ready. 

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
I have to make beetle orchid.

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Jia. 

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:21.000
I've been wondering for a long time.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
How did these plant originate?

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
The beetle orchids originate from the blood sucking mushrooms.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Usually they grows on insects, not human.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000
But there are ways to make it grow in people.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.000
How do you do it?

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000
I mixes a few secret herbs.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:48.000
But the important is…

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000
human blood.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Do you have to do this?

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000
It will remember to suck the blood of people.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000
If someone inhales or consume it, 

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:29.000
the poison will make that person's body numb

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
and unable to move.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000
It will enter and suck the person's flesh as food.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.000
the poisonous mushrooms will grow all over the body.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:55.000
That person will suffocate because he or she becomes food for the poisonous mushrooms.

00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000
So the mushrooms that grow from people aren't dangerous, are they?

01:00:01.400 --> 01:00:02.000
Yes, Madam. 

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
The mushrooms that grow out of humans cannot reproduce.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
In addition to beetle orchid, 

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
I still have a lot of orchid for different purposes. 

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
If the blood-sucking mushroom grow on other insects, 

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:22.000
it will turn out to have different properties.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000
These orchids can help us protect Mr. Tian's secret.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Li.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Li.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Where are you?

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Li.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Li.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Li.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Where are you?

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Tian. / Father.

01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:18.000
Where is your mom?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:21.000
I didn't see her. Please go to the bunker first.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Sir. 

01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.000
Chan. 

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Yang, did you see Mother and Aunt Jia?

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.000
No. How about this?

01:01:32.300 --> 01:01:34.000
You and Nuan take Father to the bunker first.

01:01:34.300 --> 01:01:36.000
Tian and I will go find Madam Li. Go. 

01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:37.000
Yes. 

01:01:37.300 --> 01:01:38.000
Please take care of him. 

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:39.000
Nuan, take care of Father and Mother.

01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.000
Yes. 

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000
Jia, you have to be very careful, it's dangerous.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:52.000
Or should I go with you. 

01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:53.000
No, Madam. 

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Others will wonder where you have been.

01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.000
Don't worry.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.000
I have beetle orchid with me. 

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000
I can definitely handle Mr. Ma's subordinates.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000
Madam Li, Madam! / Mother!

01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Mother!

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Or is Madam with Aunt Jia?

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Mother!

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.000
Aunt Jia!

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
Aunt Jia! / Mother!

01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:24.000
Mother!

01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.000
Tian. 

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.000
Madam, Aunt Jia.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Hurry up to the bunker.

01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:29.000
Let's go. 

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.000
I still can't go, Sir. 

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000
Why? Let's go together to the bunker now.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
I am boiling herb. Let me put out the fire and collect the important things first.

01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.000
Aunt Jia.

01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:40.000
Aunt Jia.

01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:42.000
Tian, hurry up and take me away. I'm scared.

01:02:42.300 --> 01:02:44.000
Let's go. Yang, go.

01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.000
I'll be right behind you. 

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:46.000
Aunt Jia.

01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.000
Madam, hurry up, let's go.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Hurry up.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Hey!

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Hey!

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Hey, what are you doing?

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:57.000
It's here. 

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Is everyone safe?

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Yes, Sir. All the workers fled to the bunker in time.

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Fortunately, the bomb didn't land in our house this time.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Where is Jia?

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.000
Where did she go?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.000
That's right. She said she would quickly follow us. 

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Everyone, when they escaped into the bunker, has anyone met Auntie Jia?

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Or is she killed by a bomb, Madam?

01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:57.000
Nuan, don't be silly. 

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Aunt Jia, she's there. 

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Jia, where did you hide?

01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.000
I've heard that you didn't go to hide with the workers.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Everyone is worried about you.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
It's when the siren rang, I had no time. 

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
So after collecting everything, I went to hide in the forest near my house. 

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000
It's dark there. 

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Aunt Jia

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000
What happened to your hand?

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:56.000
When I went to put out the fire from boiling herbs, I was in a hurry. 

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:58.000
So my hand hit the herbal pot.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.000
But everything is fine now. 

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Yang, Yang. 

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
When you called Jia to come to the bunker, 

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.000
what was she doing?

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000
I didn't see what she was doing. 

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.000
But Aunt Jia said

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000
she would pout the fire and collect the important things first.

01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000
That's strange.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Usually, she never leaves Madam Li. 

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:46.000
Since it was dangerous and explosion like this, why did she leave her boss?

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:48.000
Mom, don't mess with her. 

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:51.000
What is more important than life? 

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Taking the risk to collect things when there was an explosion?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
I think there must be something.

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:44.000
The warehouse at the temple was completely burned down?

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:46.000
How dare you?

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:47.600
No one will respect you in the future. 

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Tian! / Stop!

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:51.000
I have a doubt.

01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.000
Has anyone else known this?

01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.000
This mushroom is probably related to the chaos in our house.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.000
What's this?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000
I will let you kill the Song's eldest son.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
One more month and a half, Tian has to marry Pin. 

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:06.000
I won't be able to find the money to redeem the palace in time.

01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:09.000
You let someone call me to come here, what's the matter?

01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.000
I'd like you to meet someone.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:15.000
I know that your secret makes you unable to marry Pin.

01:10:15.200 --> 01:10:17.000
But other people don't know this.
