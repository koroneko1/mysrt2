[vocalizing]

00:45.523 --> 00:47.525
[vocalizing]

00:47.612 --> 00:50.006
[instrumental music]

01:19.557 --> 01:21.646
Em. Em.

01:21.733 --> 01:24.562
- Get her to the sofa.
- It's okay.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.216
Charlotte.

01:28.131 --> 01:29.393
Anne, find papa.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.526
Oh, it's just a bad cold.

01:31.613 --> 01:32.875
[coughing]

01:35.965 --> 01:37.662
They shouldn't be too long,
my love.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.941
- 'What is it, my love?'
- Hmm, there's nothing.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.380
[Charlotte]
'There is something.'

02:04.385 --> 02:06.038
'How did you write it?'

02:08.824 --> 02:10.739
'How did you write
Weathering Heights?'

02:12.654 --> 02:15.222
I took my pen
and put it to paper.

02:15.309 --> 02:16.658
[Emily coughing]

02:16.745 --> 02:18.138
There's something more.

02:19.356 --> 02:22.011
Something you're hiding from me.

02:22.098 --> 02:23.621
Why is it so hard
for you to believe

02:23.708 --> 02:25.841
that your sister could write
something of merit?

02:27.756 --> 02:29.497
[Charlotte]
'It's an ugly book.'

02:31.020 --> 02:33.240
'It's bias and ugly'

02:33.327 --> 02:36.373
'and full of selfish people
who only care for themselves.'

02:40.464 --> 02:41.596
Good.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.911
There is something.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.176
[door creaking]

02:56.263 --> 02:58.656
[instrumental music]

03:28.512 --> 03:30.906
[music continues]

03:52.754 --> 03:54.538
[birds chirping]

03:54.625 --> 03:56.105
[Emily sighs]

03:58.586 --> 04:00.065
[Emily]
Captain Sneaky.

04:03.852 --> 04:05.157
Captain?

04:06.898 --> 04:08.857
Soldiers are waiting
for your command, ma'am.

04:10.075 --> 04:11.686
Thank you, Captain.

04:11.773 --> 04:13.470
[instrumental music]

04:15.603 --> 04:16.778
[Emily]
Captain.

04:18.693 --> 04:20.129
Yes, ma'am?

04:21.783 --> 04:24.176
I've been thinking of
what you said, sir.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.093
And what did you think, ma'am?

04:31.749 --> 04:33.838
You are..

04:33.925 --> 04:36.928
...measurably important
to this kingdom, sir.

04:37.015 --> 04:38.800
Thank you, ma'am.

04:38.887 --> 04:41.368
What I meant to say before is..

04:41.455 --> 04:43.370
...you're more important
to me than anyone.

04:45.067 --> 04:46.155
And..

04:46.242 --> 04:47.939
[bell tolling]

04:50.725 --> 04:51.813
She's here.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.555
I'll take me leave, captain.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.948
[instrumental music]

05:10.222 --> 05:12.616
[vocalizing]

05:26.456 --> 05:30.417
- Charlotte. You're back.
- Anne.

05:34.072 --> 05:36.466
- Father.
- Welcome home.

05:36.553 --> 05:38.512
[Charlotte giggling]
Oh, Branwell.

05:38.599 --> 05:41.036
Charlotte, my girl,
we missed you.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.299
I missed you all so much.

05:43.386 --> 05:45.345
Wee congratulations,
young doll.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.912
[Charlotte]
'Yes, they want me to stay on
as a teacher after I graduate.'

05:47.999 --> 05:49.784
- 'Oh, wonderful.'
- 'Wonderful, Charlotte.'

05:49.871 --> 05:51.612
[Anne]
'Charlotte, that's great.'

05:51.699 --> 05:53.178
[Reverend Bronte]
'I wouldn't expect
anything less.

05:53.265 --> 05:54.397
'I'm so proud.'

05:54.484 --> 05:55.920
[Anne]
'I wish I was going.'

05:56.007 --> 05:57.705
- 'Emily's turn first.'
- 'Where is that girl?'

05:57.792 --> 06:01.273
- 'Daydreaming no doubt.'
- 'Em!'

06:01.361 --> 06:02.666
There she is.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.233
There's my scruff.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.540
Em, Charlotte's been
offered a teaching position

06:06.627 --> 06:08.150
at the school
after she graduates.

06:08.237 --> 06:09.760
Where have you been,
Emily Jane?

06:11.545 --> 06:13.895
Working on my French, papa.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.724
Mm. Come and help your aunt.

06:16.811 --> 06:18.421
Your sister'll be hungry.

06:23.905 --> 06:26.168
[Anne giggling]

06:26.255 --> 06:27.909
[Anne]
'Just excited to see her.'

06:32.304 --> 06:33.610
Is that you in there?

06:33.697 --> 06:35.307
[instrumental music]

06:35.395 --> 06:39.268
- It's me.
- You look different.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.401
I'm just the same.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.446
[chuckles]
Come here.

06:46.275 --> 06:47.885
And then they traveled
on the wings of the dragon

06:47.972 --> 06:49.234
and they find Captain Sneaky.

06:49.321 --> 06:51.759
Captain Sneaky?

06:51.846 --> 06:53.630
Mm. It's just for fun.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.068
I'm writing other things.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.983
We both are, Anne and I.

06:59.070 --> 07:00.942
More serious affair.

07:01.029 --> 07:02.509
What have you been writing?

07:02.596 --> 07:04.424
I haven't had time
to write anything.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.428
But you must write.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.519
Are you looking forward
to starting at school?

07:15.260 --> 07:17.872
- Yes.
- They're all dying to meet you.

07:20.265 --> 07:23.181
Is it nice having friends
outside the family?

07:23.268 --> 07:24.618
Of course.

07:28.622 --> 07:31.363
You've been working
on your French, <i>Oui?</i>

07:31.451 --> 07:32.452
<i>Oui.</i>

07:33.757 --> 07:35.846
[speaking in foreign language]

07:59.261 --> 08:01.611
[speaking in foreign language]

08:07.530 --> 08:09.663
[laughing]
What?

08:09.750 --> 08:12.579
- You said "His bottom."
- What?

08:12.666 --> 08:14.798
[laughing]

08:18.715 --> 08:19.890
[knock on door]

08:19.977 --> 08:21.152
[female #1]
'Emily.'

08:23.111 --> 08:25.243
I meant the end.

08:25.330 --> 08:27.289
The ending of it.

08:27.376 --> 08:28.986
[Charlotte laughs]
I know you did.

08:30.640 --> 08:32.250
I think Captain Sneaky
should return to battle

08:32.337 --> 08:33.600
before the dawn.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.471
No, Esmeral's waiting
for him, remember?

08:35.558 --> 08:37.865
He must journey far across
the desert and into the--

08:37.952 --> 08:40.563
You mustn't talk that way.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.305
- What way?
- At the school..

08:43.392 --> 08:45.089
[Charlotte]
'You won't,
will you, Emily Jane?'

08:46.569 --> 08:49.441
- It's just a story.
- It'll draw attention.

08:49.529 --> 08:50.921
[Charlotte]
'It's strange.'

08:52.967 --> 08:55.665
[Reverent Bronte]
'And from the wrath
of the land'

08:55.752 --> 09:00.931
for the great day
of His wrath hath come..

09:01.018 --> 09:04.587
...and who shall be
able to stand?

09:07.372 --> 09:08.504
'Amen.'

09:08.591 --> 09:10.245
[all]
Amen.

09:10.332 --> 09:11.725
[Reverent Bronte]
'And now, brethren'

09:11.812 --> 09:14.641
'it's my duty
to introduce to you today'

09:14.728 --> 09:17.513
'our new curate
Mr. William Weightman.'

09:17.600 --> 09:20.429
'He's going to assist me in this
great wager against sin.'

09:20.516 --> 09:22.257
'I'd like to
ask Mr. Weightman, uh'

09:22.344 --> 09:26.087
'graduate of Oxford University
no less, say a few words.'

09:34.182 --> 09:35.270
[sighs]

09:37.664 --> 09:40.580
[William]
'Thank you, Reverent Bronte,
for your very kind words.'

09:42.494 --> 09:46.194
Brethren, it rained my
entire journey up here.

09:46.281 --> 09:49.197
It rained and it rained

09:49.284 --> 09:53.288
and it rained and I thought..

09:53.375 --> 09:54.811
"...Where in God's name
have I landed?"

09:54.898 --> 09:56.596
[all laughing]

09:59.076 --> 10:00.774
[William]
'And as it continued to rain'

10:00.861 --> 10:03.690
'I began to think
about what I might say'

10:03.777 --> 10:08.346
at my new, slightly damp
congregation.

10:08.433 --> 10:12.307
And it occurred to me
to talk about the rain.

10:12.394 --> 10:14.831
'Because generally
I-I do love it.'

10:16.224 --> 10:18.835
To walk in it..

10:18.922 --> 10:23.057
...the feel of it,
the smell of it, and..

10:23.144 --> 10:25.886
Especially, especially
if you lie awake at night

10:25.973 --> 10:28.323
and listen to it.

10:28.410 --> 10:30.020
There's nothing quite like that.

10:31.761 --> 10:35.112
'And often, when..'

10:35.199 --> 10:38.115
'...I'm listening to the rain
in my bed late at night'

10:38.202 --> 10:41.597
'I am in despair
about, about something.'

10:41.684 --> 10:44.382
'What if I was to think..'

10:44.469 --> 10:46.863
'...we, all the people
of Howarth'

10:46.950 --> 10:50.084
'at that very moment'

10:50.171 --> 10:52.260
'are in their beds.'

10:52.347 --> 10:54.305
'And they too are
listening to the rain'

10:54.392 --> 10:59.746
'and they too are lonely
and sad and afraid.'

11:01.486 --> 11:03.401
'And suddenly I don't feel
I'm alone anymore.'

11:05.012 --> 11:06.274
God is in the rain.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.625
And God is in us.

11:11.018 --> 11:13.150
'But how can we be alone..'

11:15.413 --> 11:18.895
[William]
'...when we're all listen
to the rain together.'

11:18.982 --> 11:20.418
'Let us pray.'

11:22.943 --> 11:24.727
What are you going to give them?
There's nothing left but bread.

11:24.814 --> 11:26.642
- Did you hear him?
- Yes, the Weightman.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.557
- Wasn't he--
- Insufferable.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.254
Did you hear
what Reverent Miller said?

11:30.341 --> 11:32.387
Meaning of life
in a cup of tea.

11:32.474 --> 11:33.954
What about Weightman's? Um..

11:34.041 --> 11:34.998
Yeah, it was alright.

11:35.085 --> 11:37.131
He speaks with such poetry.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.437
- Such truth.
- Which any man can speak.

11:39.524 --> 11:40.917
What I want to know is
can he actually do--

11:41.004 --> 11:42.136
[William]
'Do what?'

11:43.964 --> 11:45.617
Ah..

11:45.705 --> 11:47.184
An empty plate.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.407
Sorry, I don't think
we've been properly introduced.

11:52.494 --> 11:54.235
Ah, Mr. William Weightman.

11:58.282 --> 12:00.502
[laughing]
Do any of you
actually speak English?

12:00.589 --> 12:02.417
[chuckles]
I do.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.419
'I mean..'

12:04.506 --> 12:07.857
'This is Emily, Anne,
and Charlotte.'

12:07.944 --> 12:10.207
'I'm Charlotte.'

12:10.294 --> 12:12.775
[William]
'God bless you all.'

12:12.862 --> 12:14.298
Your sermon was very--

12:14.385 --> 12:16.910
[William]
'Oh, I, was it too much?'

12:16.997 --> 12:18.607
I, uh..

12:18.694 --> 12:20.696
Actually, I, what I thought
halfway through, I, uh..

12:20.783 --> 12:22.437
I planned to be
a lot more eloquent.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.700
But, uh, when you get up there
you just..

12:24.787 --> 12:26.354
[Charlotte]
'Nature is always an
inspiration.'

12:26.441 --> 12:28.312
[Anne]
'Yes, nature was wonderful.'

12:28.399 --> 12:31.272
[William laughs]
Thank you. Thank you.

12:31.359 --> 12:34.971
Though, Jove,
he's very dramatic..

12:35.058 --> 12:36.756
'...in any way for joke.'

12:36.843 --> 12:39.236
[Charlotte]
'The rain was a good choice.'

12:39.323 --> 12:40.977
[William]
'Thank you.'

12:41.064 --> 12:43.110
I do wonder though.

12:43.197 --> 12:47.157
How does God squeeze himself
into all that rain?

12:47.244 --> 12:48.768
Won't he get wet?

12:52.902 --> 12:54.774
- Please, the humanities?
- Yes.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.907
- The poetry, painting, music.
- 'Exactly--'

12:57.994 --> 13:00.605
These are the very air
that our society breathes

13:00.692 --> 13:03.870
rather than destroy us,
Reverend Miller.

13:03.957 --> 13:06.655
Oh, here they are.

13:06.742 --> 13:08.918
I return home
to find my poor father

13:09.005 --> 13:11.965
overrun with the entire clergy
of Yorkshire

13:12.052 --> 13:14.445
'and not a pot
of tea to be seen.'

13:14.532 --> 13:17.405
And my sisters holding back
the new curate in the kitchen.

13:17.492 --> 13:18.667
[all laughing]

13:18.754 --> 13:20.103
Branwell Bronte.
How do you do, sir?

13:20.190 --> 13:21.235
William Weightman.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.671
Your brother has been accepted

13:22.758 --> 13:25.892
into the Royal Academy of Arts,
girls, eh.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.937
[all applauding]

13:28.024 --> 13:30.635
- 'Congratulations.'
- Thank you. Thank you.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.641
- 'That was wonderful.'
- 'Well done.'

13:38.730 --> 13:40.471
[indistinct chatter]

13:51.569 --> 13:53.180
[footsteps approaching]

13:55.965 --> 13:57.793
[dog barking]

14:05.322 --> 14:07.020
She's asking papa
if she might have a friend

14:07.107 --> 14:09.283
come stay in the spring.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.937
A friend?

14:11.024 --> 14:12.460
- Here?
- From the school.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.637
Oh.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.121
Branwell
at the Royal Academy of Arts.

14:21.208 --> 14:22.557
Can you believe it?

14:24.080 --> 14:25.821
Papa may not approve
of a visitor.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.303
You know what he's like.

14:32.480 --> 14:34.961
And you're off to become
a wonderful teacher.

14:36.919 --> 14:38.355
Yes.

14:38.442 --> 14:41.141
[Charlotte]
'Anne, Emily, come to bed.'

14:41.228 --> 14:43.056
Coming.

14:43.143 --> 14:45.493
- Captain Sneaky's tonight, aye?
- Ah..

14:47.277 --> 14:51.064
[Anne]
Perhaps we should leave
our stories for a while.

14:51.151 --> 14:53.153
[Emily]
What?

14:53.240 --> 14:56.678
Charlotte says that stories
like that are for children.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.071
She needn't know.

14:59.507 --> 15:01.204
We could sneak down tonight,
play it toge--

15:01.291 --> 15:04.338
No, we're not
children anymore, Em.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.603
I like to play
these games with you..

15:08.690 --> 15:12.607
...write these stories,
but..

15:12.694 --> 15:15.001
But what?

15:15.088 --> 15:19.483
Sometimes,
I think you actually believe--

15:19.570 --> 15:21.398
Yes?

15:21.485 --> 15:22.922
[sighs]

15:24.924 --> 15:26.926
Come on.
She's waiting.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.280
[giggles]

15:43.812 --> 15:45.945
Do you ever miss mother?

15:46.032 --> 15:48.425
[instrumental music]

15:53.648 --> 15:56.651
We agreed not to talk of her,
didn't we?

15:56.738 --> 15:57.913
Yes.

15:59.436 --> 16:01.264
But don't you dream of her?

16:06.487 --> 16:08.228
I don't dream at all now.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.014
A waste of good sleep.

16:15.539 --> 16:17.759
Besides..

16:17.846 --> 16:19.717
...we should not
dwell in the past.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.721
It's the future
we must live for.

16:23.808 --> 16:26.202
[instrumental music]

16:28.509 --> 16:29.727
Hmm?

16:39.694 --> 16:41.435
[indistinct chatter]

16:44.090 --> 16:45.743
[bell rings]

16:45.830 --> 16:47.702
I hear you're going to join
your sister at the school

16:47.789 --> 16:49.399
to study, Ms. Emily.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.447
[indistinct]

16:53.534 --> 16:56.406
- Yes.
- Well, that'd be lovely.

16:56.493 --> 16:58.191
Here you are.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.670
Thank you.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.110
Does everyone in Howarth know
that I'm going to that school?

17:04.197 --> 17:05.459
Is there applied mail
your friend Ellen?

17:05.546 --> 17:06.764
Yes.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.027
And this.

17:09.419 --> 17:10.681
From Mr. Weightman.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.989
One to each of us.

17:18.950 --> 17:20.561
Valentines!

17:20.648 --> 17:21.605
In French!

17:21.692 --> 17:22.867
[squealing]

17:22.954 --> 17:25.305
Look, little sachet of seeds.

17:25.392 --> 17:27.046
- Rose seeds.
- Is he here?

17:27.133 --> 17:28.395
Is Mr. Weightman here?

17:28.482 --> 17:30.179
He's gone over to
Keith's for the afternoon.

17:30.266 --> 17:31.702
Mrs. Bateman died.

17:31.789 --> 17:32.921
Oh, how lovely.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.749
[giggling]

17:36.185 --> 17:37.317
Look.

17:39.319 --> 17:41.364
- Going to Howarth.
- Is that so?

17:42.887 --> 17:44.454
You know it so.

17:44.541 --> 17:45.716
[William laughing]

17:47.892 --> 17:51.983
[William]
That's very kind thing to say,
Ms. Bronte.

17:53.898 --> 17:55.944
Well, it's the truth.

17:56.031 --> 18:00.514
'And I always speak the truth.'

18:00.601 --> 18:01.776
I just want to
stay in my bedroom

18:01.863 --> 18:03.343
until your friend Ellen goes.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.301
- For three days?
- 'You know what I'm like.'

18:05.388 --> 18:07.347
Can't you see
how that'll be perceived?

18:07.434 --> 18:09.000
How rude, how strange--

18:09.088 --> 18:11.002
Or you can tell her
I've gone away for a few days.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.788
No, that, no, that's insane!

18:13.875 --> 18:16.399
I won't do it, Charlotte,
I won't.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.184
You know I don't like
to meet new people.

18:22.623 --> 18:24.494
How are you going to get on
with your life if you're so--

18:24.581 --> 18:26.496
He doesn't care about you,
you know.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.715
Pardon?

18:27.802 --> 18:29.934
[Emily]
The new curate.

18:30.021 --> 18:32.241
- Weightman.
- Take that back.

18:35.462 --> 18:36.767
He's not to be trusted.

18:36.854 --> 18:39.118
He is a dear friend.

18:43.252 --> 18:44.427
You wait and see.

18:45.733 --> 18:46.690
If you give me her hand.

18:46.777 --> 18:48.039
Just, please, Mr. Weightman.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.172
- I'm sure we can manag--
- Oh. Oh.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.522
- Ellen.
- Breathe. Breathe, Ms. Nussey.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.394
- 'Mr. Weightman, honestly--'
- 'No, it's absolutely fine.'

18:54.481 --> 18:56.352
- 'I have it. I have it.'
- 'Should I go?'

18:56.439 --> 18:58.485
If you, you step back,
if you, if you step back--

18:58.572 --> 19:00.313
- Oh, gosh.
- You could've used my knee.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.531
- 'I'm not so sure of it.'
- 'Whoo!'

19:01.618 --> 19:03.577
No one push her.
No one push her.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.970
[William]
'Let go of her hand
and then if you use my knee--'

19:06.057 --> 19:09.322
Yes. I, I'm going to jump.
I'm going to go. I'm going to..

19:09.409 --> 19:11.976
[laughing]

19:12.063 --> 19:13.848
- Well done.
- Thank you.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.719
Thank you.

19:15.806 --> 19:17.678
[William]
'What small hands you have,
Ms. Nussey.'

19:17.765 --> 19:20.420
[Ellen]
Oh, thank you, Mr. Weightman.

19:20.507 --> 19:21.856
Yeah, my mother could
wear the gloves

19:21.943 --> 19:24.859
'of a four year old girl.
So they say.'

19:24.946 --> 19:26.382
[instrumental music]

19:28.123 --> 19:29.733
- Come on.
- I think it's going to rain.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.866
- 'I'll make it easy for you.'
- 'Thank you.'

19:31.953 --> 19:35.043
Oh, dear. Do you think it
will rain, Mr. Weightman?

19:35.130 --> 19:38.481
[William]
'No, it should hold
a while longer. Ms. Nussey.'

19:38.568 --> 19:40.048
[instrumental music]

19:41.441 --> 19:42.703
[Ellen]
'Sorry.'

19:42.790 --> 19:44.183
[Ellen giggles]

19:46.576 --> 19:49.623
Ellen, did have a bit of trouble
getting over that wall?

19:49.710 --> 19:51.581
[Branwell]
I'm pretty sure
I just felt a drop.

19:51.668 --> 19:52.930
- Me too!
- So did we!

19:53.017 --> 19:55.890
[William]
No. No. It will halt.

19:55.977 --> 19:57.892
[Ellen laughing]

19:57.979 --> 20:00.721
[William]
This tree. Ladies,
shelter under this tree.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.592
[laughing]

20:11.297 --> 20:13.081
[instrumental music]

20:13.168 --> 20:15.431
- This tree isn't helping.
- No, it isn't.

20:15.518 --> 20:17.128
[laughing]

20:19.087 --> 20:20.654
This is not working at all.

20:24.092 --> 20:25.528
[Branwell]
'Come on. On with it, troops.'

20:25.615 --> 20:27.182
Charge!

20:27.269 --> 20:30.359
Come on, Charlotte.
All the way to battle!

20:43.372 --> 20:45.766
[instrumental music]

21:08.179 --> 21:09.268
[laughing]

21:09.355 --> 21:10.573
Sorry.

21:15.752 --> 21:18.451
[Emily]
Look, they don't
like the rain.

21:18.538 --> 21:21.062
- The feel of it.
- The sound of it.

21:21.149 --> 21:22.585
[both]
The smell of it.

21:22.672 --> 21:24.195
[laughing]

21:24.283 --> 21:27.982
From now on we shall call him
Ms. Celia Amelia.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.549
- I'm a fool.
- No, you're not.

21:29.636 --> 21:32.334
But I'd rather be a fool
than not live at all.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.510
You're an embarrassment to us.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.077
Do you know what they
call you in the village?

21:36.164 --> 21:37.861
- Stop it, Charlotte.
- No!

21:37.948 --> 21:41.604
They call you The Strange One.
And you are.

21:41.691 --> 21:43.780
Mother would be ashamed
to see who you've become.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.869
Every time I come home
I see more and more

21:45.956 --> 21:47.262
of what you're becoming.

21:47.349 --> 21:50.178
I won't let you drag me down,
I won't!

21:50.265 --> 21:52.136
I'm going to make
something of myself.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.097
[Anne]
Charlotte.

22:00.014 --> 22:02.233
- Please talk--
- Please--

22:02.321 --> 22:04.105
- Please talk.
- Please share.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.846
- Please.
- Please.

22:05.933 --> 22:07.151
Very well.

22:07.238 --> 22:08.805
[all cheering]

22:10.546 --> 22:12.461
- He always does that?
- Does he?

22:12.548 --> 22:13.854
[laughing]

22:16.509 --> 22:18.685
- Here we go.
- This is a good story.

22:18.772 --> 22:20.208
Oh, no.

22:20.295 --> 22:21.688
[laughing]

22:27.084 --> 22:30.914
[Reverend Bronte]
Now, this mask which you see
before you..

22:31.001 --> 22:34.265
And you may pass it amongst
yourselves if you wish.

22:36.311 --> 22:40.837
Was given to my dear deceased
wife on our wedding day.

22:40.924 --> 22:43.274
But the card was never
found and so we never found out

22:43.362 --> 22:46.190
who gave us
such a mysterious gift.

22:46.277 --> 22:49.237
And then we discovered
Aunt Branwell had bought it

22:49.324 --> 22:51.761
on a drunken summer evening--

22:51.848 --> 22:55.548
Branwell, you naughty child.
It is not true.

22:55.635 --> 22:58.333
[laughing]

22:58.420 --> 23:02.119
It has long been a plaything
of my children, Mr. Weightman

23:02.206 --> 23:04.948
'who pretended that it would
give them magical powers'

23:05.035 --> 23:07.342
'transforming them into
all the characters'

23:07.429 --> 23:12.042
'of Shakespeare and the Bible.'

23:12.129 --> 23:15.698
'Although I do remember
thinking at the time'

23:15.785 --> 23:19.136
'that that may not be entirely
appropriate in the eyes of God.'

23:19.223 --> 23:20.747
[laughing]

23:24.968 --> 23:26.535
[snoring]

23:28.668 --> 23:30.321
I'm afraid as a Christian
and a clergymen

23:30.409 --> 23:32.062
I cannot condone such acts.

23:32.149 --> 23:34.587
Oh, Mr. Weightman,
it's just a bit of fun.

23:34.674 --> 23:37.154
- No!
- My friend, come here.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.939
No, no, no, no, no.

23:39.026 --> 23:41.855
Nothing you say, sir,
shall persuade me. Nothing.

23:43.291 --> 23:44.771
[laughing]

23:46.729 --> 23:50.951
D-d-do you,
do you like cake?

23:51.038 --> 23:52.518
[speaking in foreign language]

24:01.091 --> 24:02.484
Ah.

24:02.571 --> 24:04.617
Do you like cake so much

24:04.704 --> 24:06.183
that you want
everybody to eat it?

24:06.270 --> 24:08.708
Yes. Let's all eat cake!

24:08.795 --> 24:11.058
- Are you Marie Antoinette?
- <i>Oui!</i>

24:11.145 --> 24:12.581
[laughing]

24:12.668 --> 24:15.889
[William]
'Excellent, Ms. Bronte.'

24:15.976 --> 24:18.979
Well, I say we may use up
the London stage, Charlotte.

24:19.066 --> 24:21.547
Oh, I'm sure that honor
belongs to you, Ellen dear.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.026
[William]
'Should we call a close?'

24:23.113 --> 24:25.159
Well, but Emily hasn't
had a turn.

24:25.246 --> 24:26.508
Oh, no.

24:26.595 --> 24:28.292
- No.
- Oh, come on, Em. Last one.

24:28.379 --> 24:30.207
- Everyone else had a turn.
- I don't want to.

24:30.294 --> 24:31.948
Yes, if she doesn't want to

24:32.035 --> 24:34.124
and really,
she wouldn't be any good.

24:35.604 --> 24:36.605
Hmm.

24:39.652 --> 24:41.044
- Give it to me.
- Do you know who--

24:41.131 --> 24:42.481
Yes, give it here.

24:47.616 --> 24:51.272
Now just wait until someone
comes to you.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.494
[sniffles]

24:59.019 --> 25:00.281
[Anne]
'Who are you?'

25:00.368 --> 25:01.935
Still me. I'm sorry.

25:02.022 --> 25:03.110
- For the love of God.
- It's getting late. Can--

25:03.197 --> 25:05.286
Shh. Please.

25:05.373 --> 25:06.896
It can be anyone.
A queen, pirate--

25:06.983 --> 25:08.376
She's too shy.

25:08.463 --> 25:09.551
She shouldn't be
made to do it.

25:09.638 --> 25:10.813
She's not shy,
she just needs some--

25:10.900 --> 25:12.206
Everybody's had a turn.

25:12.293 --> 25:15.035
Yes, everybody's had a turn,
it's her--

25:15.122 --> 25:16.515
It's not for you to say,
Mr. Weightman.

25:16.602 --> 25:18.038
It isn't for you to say and--

25:18.125 --> 25:19.518
[Emily]
'Children.'

25:26.394 --> 25:27.700
Who are you?

25:29.092 --> 25:30.659
I cannot stay long.

25:30.746 --> 25:32.705
Where did you come from?

25:32.792 --> 25:35.490
- From the dark.
- Here we go.

25:35.577 --> 25:37.405
It's so cold outside.

25:37.492 --> 25:39.189
I'm glad to be in here with you.

25:40.800 --> 25:42.192
Where did you come from?

25:45.195 --> 25:47.197
I'm afraid it will frighten you
if I tell you.

25:52.115 --> 25:53.552
Why would we be afraid?

25:57.381 --> 25:58.557
Don't you know who I am?

26:01.821 --> 26:02.909
Who are you?

26:02.996 --> 26:04.563
I lived here not long ago.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.827
And I knew you all.

26:07.914 --> 26:09.350
[wind blowing continues]

26:10.438 --> 26:11.874
Emily.

26:11.961 --> 26:13.484
I can see through this mask that
Emily is wearing.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.835
'I can see Charlotte.'

26:15.922 --> 26:18.925
'And Branwell, and Anne.'

26:19.012 --> 26:21.318
You all look so lovely,
my angels.

26:24.931 --> 26:26.280
Who are you?

26:28.978 --> 26:30.501
Who are you?

26:32.852 --> 26:34.244
[instrumental music]

26:34.331 --> 26:36.029
Don't you know me, child?

26:36.116 --> 26:37.421
[exhales]

26:38.945 --> 26:40.207
Mother.

26:40.903 --> 26:43.384
Mother.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.473
- Stop it, Emily.
- Please, stop. Please, stop.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.345
- Please, stop.
- 'Please don't be afraid.'

26:48.432 --> 26:51.566
I waited so long
to see you all my children.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.655
- Mother.
- What can we do, mama?

26:53.742 --> 26:55.309
[Emily]
'I worry so much, my children.'

26:55.396 --> 26:57.528
We miss you so,
we try to be good.

26:57.616 --> 27:00.227
- Branwell.
- Mother.

27:00.314 --> 27:04.535
You hold yourself still, child.
Hold yourself to the ground.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.885
Yes, mother.

27:05.972 --> 27:08.061
- Mother.
- Anne.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.541
[Emily]
'Dear, sweet one,
you are alright.'

27:10.629 --> 27:12.413
I feel you now.

27:12.500 --> 27:14.067
Charlotte.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.025
Little mother,
where are you darling child?

27:16.112 --> 27:17.418
'I want so much for you to be--'

27:17.505 --> 27:18.854
Mother, I try, I try to be good.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.551
And Emily..

27:20.639 --> 27:23.598
Tell Emily that when she is
lonely

27:23.685 --> 27:25.774
she wants [indistinct].

27:25.861 --> 27:28.037
[door rattling]

27:28.124 --> 27:30.518
[instrumental music]

27:38.352 --> 27:40.659
They're here.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.922
- Who's here?
- They've come to take me back.

27:43.009 --> 27:44.619
- 'Oh, my God.'
- Mama.

27:44.706 --> 27:47.100
I've come to warn you.
The mask will break.

27:47.187 --> 27:49.668
The mask is not your friend,
it will break you.

27:49.755 --> 27:52.496
Every night I watch you
and cry that my children won't..

27:52.583 --> 27:55.151
'...someone
will wear the mask.'

27:55.238 --> 27:58.198
'They cannot breathe!
They cannot breathe!'

27:58.285 --> 28:00.417
- They're coming out.
- Get the mask off!

28:00.504 --> 28:02.289
Let me see!

28:02.376 --> 28:03.986
[screaming]

28:04.073 --> 28:06.119
[Emily]
'Please, children,
you have to let me go.'

28:06.206 --> 28:07.642
Mama!

28:07.729 --> 28:09.775
[screaming]

28:09.862 --> 28:10.950
Mama!

28:12.299 --> 28:13.735
[Charlotte]
'Mama!'

28:13.822 --> 28:15.606
[panting]

28:15.694 --> 28:17.652
[dramatic music]

28:17.739 --> 28:19.915
[William]
Take the mask off her!

28:20.002 --> 28:22.526
Let me speak to them.

28:22.613 --> 28:24.006
[screaming]

28:25.399 --> 28:26.922
- Mama.
- Mama!

28:27.009 --> 28:30.230
- 'Come back.'
- How dare you, Ms. Bronte?

28:30.317 --> 28:31.492
How dare you?

28:31.579 --> 28:33.059
- We love you, mama!
- Come back!

28:33.146 --> 28:35.278
We love you!

28:35.365 --> 28:36.540
[Charlotte]
'Come back.'

28:38.717 --> 28:40.675
- Please come back.
- Mama!

28:40.762 --> 28:42.721
- We love you so--
- 'What has happened?'

28:44.374 --> 28:45.724
What has happened?

28:45.811 --> 28:48.030
[panting]

29:11.053 --> 29:12.446
[panting]

29:14.143 --> 29:16.015
[birds chirping]

29:26.982 --> 29:29.376
[instrumental music]

29:37.384 --> 29:39.299
Remember to keep still,
everyone.

29:48.090 --> 29:49.265
Bye-bye, love.

29:52.225 --> 29:53.661
- Thank you.
- And good luck.

30:00.886 --> 30:02.801
We expect great things.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.803
[instrumental music]

30:35.398 --> 30:37.270
[music continues]

31:07.474 --> 31:09.345
[music continues]

31:39.985 --> 31:41.900
[music continues]

31:48.907 --> 31:50.256
[Branwell]
'There's something
about my spirit'

31:50.343 --> 31:52.649
'which cannot be
contained within a brush.'

31:52.736 --> 31:55.914
'The visions in my head
are too vivid, too large'

31:56.001 --> 31:57.437
'to fill a mere canvas.'

31:57.524 --> 32:00.266
'And it is with words, papa'

32:00.353 --> 32:02.616
'that I will truly
find my vocation.'

32:04.052 --> 32:05.401
But the money?

32:07.360 --> 32:09.275
[Reverend Bronte sighs]

32:09.362 --> 32:12.408
Anne will go with Charlotte
to the school in the morning.

32:12.495 --> 32:16.064
Rest tomorrow we will decide
how to proceed.

32:16.151 --> 32:18.980
I will do better
and be better, sir.

32:23.854 --> 32:27.728
[Charlotte]
'When I'm gone,
you'll need to..'

32:27.815 --> 32:30.774
'You must find a way
to make yourself useful.'

32:30.861 --> 32:32.776
'To papa, to the family.'

32:34.517 --> 32:37.042
'I know it's difficult
for you, this life..'

32:39.174 --> 32:42.351
'...but try not to be
a burden, Emily Jane.'

32:42.438 --> 32:44.527
'You must avoid that
at all cost.'

32:45.746 --> 32:46.921
[door closes]

32:47.008 --> 32:48.749
[footsteps approaching]

32:55.277 --> 32:56.583
[door creaks]

32:56.670 --> 32:58.106
Come on.

32:58.193 --> 33:00.456
- Pardon?
- Get dressed.

33:00.543 --> 33:01.980
We're going out.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.416
[Branwell exhales]

33:03.503 --> 33:05.113
[Branwell]
Breathe in all that fresh air.

33:05.200 --> 33:06.593
Have you ever felt so alive?

33:06.680 --> 33:07.986
[Emily laughs]

33:08.073 --> 33:10.466
[indistinct chatter]

33:13.208 --> 33:15.602
[birds chirping]

33:19.954 --> 33:23.436
Oh, and I nearly lost my life
in a fight.

33:23.523 --> 33:24.785
A fight?

33:24.872 --> 33:26.308
I was doubled up on the ground.

33:26.395 --> 33:28.136
Somebody's foot kicking
into my stomach

33:28.223 --> 33:30.921
I could feel it almost
connecting with my backbone.

33:31.009 --> 33:33.141
And then, nothing.

33:34.664 --> 33:36.710
- Gosh.
- Should we sit?

33:36.797 --> 33:38.451
Mm.

33:38.538 --> 33:41.584
And then I realized
what I wanted to do.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.760
Like a gas light
flaring up in me.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.067
And all this
has opened my eyes.

33:46.154 --> 33:49.723
I mean, who was that before?
Who was I?

33:49.810 --> 33:51.203
I do not know.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.293
You alright there?

33:54.380 --> 33:55.642
Yes.

33:55.729 --> 33:58.253
And what do you want to do?

33:58.340 --> 34:00.429
- Hmm?
- With your life.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.563
I don't know.

34:03.650 --> 34:05.521
That's not very good, is it?

34:05.608 --> 34:08.394
- I am to write.
- To write?

34:08.481 --> 34:11.179
Yes. And what do you think
I should write about?

34:11.266 --> 34:12.963
What?

34:13.051 --> 34:16.489
I shall take from
my own life. The ordinary.

34:16.576 --> 34:19.492
And make it extraordinary.

34:19.579 --> 34:22.321
[chuckles]
But why?

34:22.408 --> 34:23.974
The great Shelley
says that God surrounds

34:24.062 --> 34:26.281
each artist with
different things.

34:26.368 --> 34:30.024
Good, bad,
beautiful, and ugly.

34:30.111 --> 34:31.895
And that there's
design in that.

34:31.982 --> 34:35.029
There's reason in that.

34:36.900 --> 34:38.293
I was going to be teacher.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.731
As Charlotte.

34:41.818 --> 34:43.646
I think papa
would have liked that.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.175
What do you think?

34:50.262 --> 34:52.046
Pardon?

34:52.133 --> 34:54.570
What do you think yourself?

34:54.657 --> 34:56.181
[wind blowing]

34:59.009 --> 35:00.620
I never wanted
to be teacher.

35:00.707 --> 35:02.100
[Emily laughing]

35:03.797 --> 35:07.801
I just did it because I thought
then papa would love me

35:07.888 --> 35:09.629
as he loves Charlotte.

35:11.718 --> 35:14.764
Is there something
wrong with me, brother?

35:14.851 --> 35:16.940
Hmm?

35:17.027 --> 35:18.246
Charlotte says
all the people in the village

35:18.333 --> 35:19.726
call me The Strange One.

35:21.554 --> 35:23.730
Am I strange?

35:23.817 --> 35:25.645
Everyone's strange if you look
at them for long enough.

35:25.732 --> 35:28.256
No, it's just
Charlotte's always right.

35:28.343 --> 35:29.736
Charlotte?

35:31.390 --> 35:33.348
What?

35:33.435 --> 35:35.176
She's the embodiment of a lie.

35:36.395 --> 35:38.092
Well, surely you must know this.

35:39.789 --> 35:42.444
Father's love,
that's all she wants.

35:42.531 --> 35:46.796
So she's put away her
stories and her dreams..

35:46.883 --> 35:48.102
...her magic.

35:48.189 --> 35:49.625
You shouldn't say that.

35:49.712 --> 35:51.845
- Why not?
- Because she's our sister.

35:51.932 --> 35:53.542
We're supposed to
love and cherish her.

35:53.629 --> 35:56.589
Do you think she loves
and cherishes you

35:56.676 --> 35:58.547
who you really are?

36:09.079 --> 36:10.733
Do you think
I could be a writer?

36:12.605 --> 36:14.998
Perhaps.

36:15.085 --> 36:16.870
You'd have to show me
something first though.

36:19.133 --> 36:20.656
I have lots of stories.

36:23.050 --> 36:24.878
- Should we go back?
- Mm.

36:28.664 --> 36:30.362
[grunts]

36:30.449 --> 36:31.754
What's this?

36:31.841 --> 36:34.366
Hmm? Oh, yes.

36:34.453 --> 36:36.063
My creed.

36:38.892 --> 36:40.328
Don't let Aunt B see that.

36:40.415 --> 36:42.809
I don't care
if she sees it or not.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.506
"Freedom in thought."

36:44.593 --> 36:46.508
Mm, yes, but you can't
say it though.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.162
You have to shout it.

36:48.249 --> 36:50.904
- Freedom in thought!
- What are you doing?

36:50.991 --> 36:53.689
- You try.
- No, you're being silly.

36:53.776 --> 36:56.126
I'm deadly serious.
Come on.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.825
No, someone might hear us.

36:58.912 --> 37:02.307
Oh, yeah. They might.

37:02.394 --> 37:07.312
Freedom in thought!
Freedom in thought!

37:07.399 --> 37:09.662
Try it.

37:09.749 --> 37:12.708
- Freedom in thought!
- Oh, pathetic attempt.

37:12.795 --> 37:15.494
Freedom in thought!
Come on, really get behind it.

37:15.581 --> 37:18.279
- Freedom in thought!
- Come on. Give us some welly.

37:18.366 --> 37:20.890
Freedom in thought!

37:20.977 --> 37:23.676
Freedom in thought!

37:23.763 --> 37:26.200
Emily Jane,
I think Reverend Miller

37:26.287 --> 37:27.419
might have just
fallen off his chair

37:27.506 --> 37:28.724
in the rectory.

37:28.811 --> 37:29.812
Good.

37:29.899 --> 37:31.031
Freedom in thought!

37:31.118 --> 37:32.380
Freedom in thought!

37:32.467 --> 37:33.512
Freedom in thought!

37:33.599 --> 37:34.861
Freedom in thought!

37:34.948 --> 37:36.079
Freedom in thought!

37:36.166 --> 37:38.691
Freedom in thought!

37:38.778 --> 37:40.258
[Emily chuckling]

37:42.738 --> 37:44.174
[Emily sighs]

37:45.959 --> 37:48.309
[instrumental music]

37:51.312 --> 37:56.099
- It was...very well executed.
- Executed?

Mr. Weightman will be
tutoring you in French.

39:38.550 --> 39:39.986
'You will start this morning.'

39:41.291 --> 39:42.597
Thank you, father.

[Emily clears throat]

Blindly?

41:31.401 --> 41:33.360

Hmm.

[speaking in foreign language]

41:57.253 --> 41:59.168
[speaking in foreign language]

42:00.953 --> 42:02.215
There's a great deal
of difference.

42:45.606 --> 42:47.695
[birds chirping]

42:47.782 --> 42:50.698
Weightman was advertising
blind faith today.

42:50.785 --> 42:53.571
- While speaking French?
- Yes.

42:53.658 --> 42:55.442
- Very clever that one.
- Mm.

42:57.444 --> 42:59.272
He says it's the only way
to the afterlife.

43:01.927 --> 43:03.798
He's just drumming up business.

43:03.885 --> 43:06.888
Without focus on questioning
sheep, what is a shepherd?

43:06.975 --> 43:08.411

[Emily mimics goat's bleat]

43:23.862 --> 43:24.993
[instrumental music]

43:26.821 --> 43:32.087
And Jove accuses God
of, of being, of being unjust.

43:32.174 --> 43:34.742
- 'Shh.'
- 'Then afterward..'

43:34.829 --> 43:36.091
[clock dings]

43:38.964 --> 43:40.748
Where is he?

43:40.835 --> 43:43.272
[sighs]

43:43.359 --> 43:45.187
Go and fetch him,
will you, Emily Jane?

43:45.274 --> 43:48.451
I'm sure that I recognize
this photo from somewhere.

43:48.538 --> 43:50.628
The snake from Garden of Eden.

43:50.715 --> 43:52.455
[laughing]

43:54.762 --> 43:58.113
Oh, Emily.
Save me from these wolfs.

43:58.200 --> 44:00.507
[laughing]

44:00.594 --> 44:04.163
Gentlemen, may I present
my sister Ms. Emily Bronte.

'I know your father well.'

of Delaney lodge.

44:10.473 --> 44:13.085
How do you do, young lady?

44:15.130 --> 44:16.958
Aunt says to come home
for supper now.

44:17.045 --> 44:19.004
[Branwell]
'Mm, just come and sit
with me for a minute'

44:19.091 --> 44:20.527
while I finish my drink, yeah?

44:20.614 --> 44:23.225
We are discussing
the ensuing election

44:23.312 --> 44:26.315
Or should I say
the rat race of humans scum.

44:26.402 --> 44:28.578
Yeah.

44:28.666 --> 44:30.929
- 'Would you [indistinct] miss?'
- Unh.

44:31.016 --> 44:32.844
Oh, come on, Em.

44:32.931 --> 44:36.674
Here. Have some of mine
first to see if you like it.

44:50.209 --> 44:51.819
[Sir Ralph]
'Get the glasses, Chevy.'

44:51.906 --> 44:53.952
I wonder what they argue
so much about.

44:54.039 --> 44:55.518
[Branwell]
That's what I said.

44:55.605 --> 44:57.433
'It is a wonder
they do not chase each other'

44:57.520 --> 45:02.351
around and around
and around the house.

45:02.438 --> 45:05.267
[Sir Ralph]
'I'll tell you neither of them
will get my vote.'

45:05.354 --> 45:07.269
[Branwell]
'Sir Ralph, you lie like a rug.'

45:07.356 --> 45:09.576
'You have not voted
since Julius Caesar.'

45:09.663 --> 45:11.665
[laughing]

45:13.798 --> 45:17.018
[Branwell]
'Tonight be fair, sir.
Tonight be fair.'

45:17.105 --> 45:19.151
[Sir Ralph]
'I don't trust any of them.'

45:23.590 --> 45:24.809
[knock on door]

45:31.206 --> 45:32.642
[Emily chuckling]

45:32.730 --> 45:35.123
[piano music]

46:05.240 --> 46:07.634
[music continues]

[applauding]

46:24.782 --> 46:26.827
[all applauding]

46:26.914 --> 46:28.611
- 'That one was promising.'
- 'Lovely, Emily.'

46:28.698 --> 46:31.136
- 'Yes, well done.'
- Thank you, Reverend Miller.

46:31.223 --> 46:33.442
Doesn't she play beautifully?

46:33.529 --> 46:35.749
Oh, yes.
It's intoxicating.

46:37.969 --> 46:39.187
[giggles]

46:44.584 --> 46:46.629
[speaking in foreign language]

46:58.119 --> 47:00.861
Perhaps...we should
finish early today.

47:03.342 --> 47:04.952
Seems that last night's
entertainment

47:05.039 --> 47:07.520
has exhausted your powers
of concentration.

47:15.658 --> 47:17.660
Ms. Bronte,
your brother can be unstable--

47:17.747 --> 47:19.575
Do not speak of my brother.

47:19.662 --> 47:21.751
I see that he's becoming
a true friend for you.

47:21.839 --> 47:24.319
A blessing in this wasteland
but I worry that

47:24.406 --> 47:26.887
to be influenced by Branwell
could harm your soul.

47:26.974 --> 47:28.280
If much--

47:28.367 --> 47:29.368
If it is my soul,
it is none of your business

47:29.455 --> 47:31.283
whom it spends time with.

47:31.370 --> 47:33.415
And if my home
is a wasteland to you

47:33.502 --> 47:35.548
I suggest you go back to your
[unintelligible]

47:35.635 --> 47:36.810
we will not miss you.

47:38.551 --> 47:39.726
What is that?

47:41.467 --> 47:42.816
What is that?

47:53.740 --> 47:55.220
"Freedom in.."

48:03.750 --> 48:05.186
[door slams]

48:20.375 --> 48:23.117
<i>[Emily]</i>
<i>"O'thy bright eyes</i>
<i>must answer now.</i>

48:23.204 --> 48:24.727
<i>"When reason</i>
<i>with a scornful brow</i>

48:24.814 --> 48:27.208
<i>"is mocking at my overthrow.</i>

48:27.295 --> 48:29.297
<i>O'thy sweet tongue must.."</i>

48:37.305 --> 48:39.438
[dog barking]

48:45.226 --> 48:47.402
[wind whistling]

48:47.489 --> 48:49.361
[Branwell]
Come on, it's just up ahead.

48:49.448 --> 48:50.623
[Emily]
Where are we going?

48:50.710 --> 48:52.103
[Branwell]
Surprise.

48:57.108 --> 48:58.718
Branwell.

48:58.805 --> 49:00.720
[Branwell]
'They can't see us. Shh.'

49:00.807 --> 49:02.722
'Sometimes I get so close,
my nose is practically'

49:02.809 --> 49:04.811
squashed up against the glass.

49:04.898 --> 49:06.160
[chuckles]

49:06.247 --> 49:07.683
What do you think
they're thinking?

49:07.770 --> 49:09.598
Hmm.

49:09.685 --> 49:11.470
The son is thinking..

49:12.906 --> 49:15.169
"...That pudding was delicious.

49:15.256 --> 49:17.780
"When mama and papa are asleep,
I shall snoop downstairs

49:17.867 --> 49:20.131
and gorge myself silly on it."

49:20.218 --> 49:21.654
And he is thinking..

49:23.047 --> 49:25.527
"...What a handsome
fellow I am.

49:25.614 --> 49:27.312
"I'm sure
the cook fancies me.

49:27.399 --> 49:29.314
Why, yesterday I'm certain
she winked at me."

49:29.401 --> 49:30.968
- Cook has a twitchy eye.
- And a wooden leg.

49:31.055 --> 49:33.100
And her hearing will be gone.

49:33.187 --> 49:34.972
And she?

49:35.059 --> 49:37.235
She's beautiful,
isn't she?

49:37.322 --> 49:39.150
Do you think
she married him for his money?

49:41.369 --> 49:42.588
Perhaps she hasn't.

49:44.851 --> 49:46.505
[thunder rumbling]

49:51.597 --> 49:52.859
It's alright.

Oh, hell. Come on.
Come on. Come on!

50:07.874 --> 50:10.050
[Mr. Linton]
'Hey, there they are!'

50:10.137 --> 50:11.573
Branwell, wait.

50:11.660 --> 50:13.445
Wait. Wait.

50:13.532 --> 50:15.360
[dog barking]

50:16.187 --> 50:17.623
Come back here!

50:19.886 --> 50:22.019
Branwell, wait for me!
Branwell!

[instrumental music]

50:26.849 --> 50:27.981
Whoo!

50:37.686 --> 50:39.123
And your brother's room.

50:55.661 --> 50:58.185
[birds chirping]

51:13.592 --> 51:15.246
I've got some errands
this afternoon.

51:15.333 --> 51:16.986
Could you put the washing
on the line?

51:17.074 --> 51:18.423
Yes.

51:24.777 --> 51:26.648
[sofa screeching]

51:27.910 --> 51:29.434
Good girl.

51:38.965 --> 51:41.359

[indistinct chatter]

53:23.983 --> 53:26.377
[instrumental music]

53:37.126 --> 53:38.954
Ms. Bronte.

53:39.041 --> 53:41.087
Miss Bronte.

53:41.174 --> 53:43.132
Are you so lost?

53:43.220 --> 53:44.786
Are you going to tell father?

53:47.006 --> 53:48.529
- Let me look at your face.
- No.

53:48.616 --> 53:49.878
Let me see.

53:53.055 --> 53:55.014
Thank God, Ms. Bronte.

53:55.101 --> 53:57.016
- It's nothing.
- Nothing?

53:57.103 --> 53:58.713
I'll kill him
when I find him.

53:58.800 --> 54:01.281
Bran wasn't..

54:01.368 --> 54:03.022
I stole it from him.

54:04.502 --> 54:06.068
You stole it?

54:06.155 --> 54:07.983
Tell father quickly then.

54:08.070 --> 54:10.986
It's the time he'd be spared of
restless night's sheep, sleep.

54:11.073 --> 54:12.597
Oh, I'm sure
you'll be guaranteed

54:12.684 --> 54:14.207
a blissful night's sleep.

54:16.731 --> 54:18.385
Go inside. Go home.

54:18.472 --> 54:19.691
Are you going to tell father?

54:19.778 --> 54:21.083
Are you going to tell..

54:21.170 --> 54:23.216
[birds chirping]

54:26.219 --> 54:27.742
[door squeaking]

54:33.487 --> 54:34.923
You're late.

54:51.418 --> 54:52.941
[leaves rustling]

54:58.338 --> 54:59.731
You didn't tell my father.

55:01.820 --> 55:03.169
No. I didn't.

55:04.692 --> 55:05.954
Why not?

55:11.569 --> 55:12.613
A mystery.

55:24.495 --> 55:25.887
Should we go back?

55:27.802 --> 55:29.543
We just got here.

55:29.630 --> 55:32.111
I'll be going to bed soon
anyway.

55:32.198 --> 55:34.592
I saw you with Weightman today.

55:34.679 --> 55:38.117
- What?
- I saw you today.

55:38.204 --> 55:39.379
He used to be
the butt of our jokes

55:39.466 --> 55:40.728
and now I see you
walking out with him.

55:40.815 --> 55:42.339
You are drunk, brother.

55:42.426 --> 55:43.905
- What were you talking about?
- There's nothing.

55:43.992 --> 55:46.952
Thinks himself to be an artist,
the way he preaches..

55:48.432 --> 55:49.955
...but he's not.

55:50.042 --> 55:52.174
- You know he looks at you.
- What?

55:52.261 --> 55:55.743
- What are you talking about?
- Look at you. You're blushing.

55:55.830 --> 55:58.006
He thinks he has to care for my
soul as to cure it, that's all.

55:58.093 --> 56:00.139
He doesn't care for it,
he wants it.

56:00.226 --> 56:02.402
'And when he realizes
he can't have it'

56:02.489 --> 56:05.579
when he realizes
what you really are..

56:05.666 --> 56:07.102
[instrumental music]

56:08.887 --> 56:10.279
...he'll be terrified.

56:10.367 --> 56:11.585
[door opens]

56:15.502 --> 56:16.982
Run.

56:17.069 --> 56:18.940
- 'There they are!'
- 'Go!'

56:19.027 --> 56:21.290
- 'Go, go, go!'
- 'Come back here!'

56:22.857 --> 56:24.729
[dog barking]

56:27.732 --> 56:30.952
Ah! Run away. Go away, my love.
Go! Go!'

56:35.914 --> 56:38.395
[instrumental music]

56:40.266 --> 56:42.573
[indistinct chatter]

56:45.880 --> 56:47.404
He asked me to fetch you in.

56:49.014 --> 56:50.407
Were you there?

56:52.104 --> 56:53.279
Was it you?

57:06.466 --> 57:09.687
The problems that you arise..

57:09.774 --> 57:12.516
Can you truly do this with
his voice always in your ear?

57:14.605 --> 57:17.129
[Mr. Linton]
'I cannot say, Reverend Bronte.
It was dark.'

57:17.216 --> 57:19.740
'The girl was similar
but had such a..'

57:19.827 --> 57:23.440
'...wild looking
or like a gypsy or a beggar.'

57:23.527 --> 57:25.964
[Reverend Bronte]
'You may not have any
self-restraint'

57:26.051 --> 57:28.619
'but you will show some
in this house.'

57:30.621 --> 57:32.666
Was it you, girl?

57:32.753 --> 57:34.799
Were you out tonight spying
into respectable houses

57:34.886 --> 57:37.192
instead of tending to your
prayers because if it were you--

57:37.279 --> 57:41.327
Mr. Linton, if you will allow me
to conduct the questions please.

57:41.414 --> 57:43.895
Now, daughter..

57:43.982 --> 57:46.463
...you will answer truthfully.
Do you understand?

57:46.550 --> 57:48.160
Yes, father.

57:48.247 --> 57:49.640
Did you see Branwell last night?

57:50.945 --> 57:52.730
I saw him at supper.

57:52.817 --> 57:56.124
[Reverend Bronte]
'But did you see him
after that?'

57:56.211 --> 57:57.169
Yes.

57:57.256 --> 57:58.475
Is it entirely necessary

57:58.562 --> 58:00.302
to subject a young
inexperienced woman--

58:00.389 --> 58:03.001
I think it is, sir, and if she's
as guilty as a brother

58:03.088 --> 58:04.829
there'll be consequences
for her too.

58:04.916 --> 58:08.223
Where did you see him last?

58:08.310 --> 58:10.835
- 'Why does she not speak?'
- 'Where did you see him?'

58:10.922 --> 58:13.490
Do not bring shame
on this house, Emily Jane.

58:15.143 --> 58:16.318
[Mr. Linton]
'Speak, girl.'

58:17.885 --> 58:20.279
Did you go with him..

58:20.366 --> 58:23.151
...Emily Jane?

58:23.238 --> 58:26.154
- 'Answer!'
- I-I..

58:28.766 --> 58:30.768
I told him I was tired.

58:30.855 --> 58:32.552
And that it was madness to go
out at such a dark night

58:32.639 --> 58:34.206
and so he left me.

58:37.035 --> 58:38.732
Father, please.

58:38.819 --> 58:40.908
[Reverend Bronte]
'Very well, Emily Jane,
you can go.'

58:40.995 --> 58:42.780
- Father, please don't hurt him.
- Take her out.

58:42.867 --> 58:44.259
- Branwell, take off your shirt.
- Please--

58:44.346 --> 58:45.739
I don't want her to see
for God's sake.

58:45.826 --> 58:48.307
No, he, don't.
He's already in pain, papa.

58:48.394 --> 58:50.527
He's hurt his leg,
you don't need to hurt him more.

58:50.614 --> 58:51.789
Let go of me!

58:54.443 --> 58:55.880
Where are they taking him?

58:55.967 --> 58:57.577
He's to work for Mr. Linton
to make amends.

58:57.664 --> 58:58.883
No.

58:58.970 --> 59:01.276
He's to tutor his son
for amends.

59:01.363 --> 59:03.235
'Oh, come now.'

59:03.322 --> 59:05.629
Branwell! Branwell!

59:05.716 --> 59:06.804
Branwell!

59:09.502 --> 59:10.764
[Emily sighs]

59:14.115 --> 59:16.553
[wind whistling]

59:29.478 --> 59:31.655
[Oprah singing]

1:00:00.814 --> 1:00:03.208
[singing continues]

1:00:33.412 --> 1:00:35.806
[singing continues]

1:00:56.827 --> 1:00:59.220

1:01:23.680 --> 1:01:25.682
[all applauding]

1:01:34.908 --> 1:01:36.780
- Take Emily home.
- Yes, sir.

1:01:40.087 --> 1:01:41.306
Excuse me.

1:01:47.834 --> 1:01:49.140
[William]
Ms. Bronte.

1:01:51.882 --> 1:01:53.361
Ms. Bronte.

1:01:57.583 --> 1:02:00.194
Ms. Bronte, wait. Your father
said I was to take you--

1:02:00.281 --> 1:02:01.674
[Emily]
We'll have to wait in here.

1:02:12.946 --> 1:02:15.079
I hope tonight illustrates
once and for all

1:02:15.166 --> 1:02:17.168
why your brother is
a dangerous influence.

1:02:17.255 --> 1:02:18.473
Because he kissed a woman?

1:02:18.560 --> 1:02:20.171
Because he kissed
a married woman.

1:02:22.260 --> 1:02:23.652
[Emily]
'Do you know what we
sisters used to call you?'

1:02:25.176 --> 1:02:27.221
Celia Amelia.

1:02:27.308 --> 1:02:29.528
- Do you know why?
- Why?

1:02:29.615 --> 1:02:31.660
Because you're like
a little girl in a ribbon shop.

1:02:31.748 --> 1:02:33.880
This ribbon, no, that ribbon.
You know better than him.

1:02:33.967 --> 1:02:35.490
I'm surprised you notice
what I was doing at all.

1:02:35.577 --> 1:02:37.144
You spend most of your time
looking at your feet.

1:02:45.370 --> 1:02:46.675
Celia Amelia?

1:02:53.334 --> 1:02:54.771
I suppose..

1:02:57.077 --> 1:02:58.687
...it's in my nature.

1:03:01.038 --> 1:03:02.779
To always want something new.

1:03:06.173 --> 1:03:07.740
Don't know why I should be so.

1:03:07.827 --> 1:03:09.698
Why do you always
look at your feet?

1:03:11.875 --> 1:03:13.790
You hear how people talk of me?

1:03:16.705 --> 1:03:18.098
I am odd.

1:03:20.797 --> 1:03:22.189
I am an odd fish.

1:03:23.408 --> 1:03:25.845
- A fish?
- Mm.

1:03:25.932 --> 1:03:28.108
If you take me away from here,
I'll dry up and fade away.

1:03:30.197 --> 1:03:31.895
I see.

1:20:07.890 --> 1:20:11.197
'I mean, her French has
improved markedly.'

1:20:11.284 --> 1:20:12.198
I'm happy here, father.

1:20:14.548 --> 1:20:16.899
I don't want to speak French.

1:20:16.986 --> 1:20:20.511
How dare you be so insolent,
Emily Jane, you will converse.

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:32.566
[birds chirping]

1:21:18.395 --> 1:21:19.309
[cup clinks]

1:21:20.788 --> 1:21:22.878
[Patrick]
'Well..'

1:21:22.965 --> 1:21:26.490
Sounds like she'll give you
a run for your money.

1:21:26.577 --> 1:21:28.100
'Well, think on it.'

1:21:28.187 --> 1:21:30.233
I shall have to look
at the finances, of course.

1:21:31.364 --> 1:21:32.278

1:23:52.636 --> 1:23:55.030
[bird squawking]

1:23:57.771 --> 1:23:58.729
William!

1:24:06.389 --> 1:24:07.346
William!

1:24:07.433 --> 1:24:08.347
[knocks on door]

1:24:09.566 --> 1:24:10.523
'William!'

1:24:10.610 --> 1:24:11.524
[knocking continues]

1:24:13.091 --> 1:24:15.876
Let me in, please.

1:24:15.963 --> 1:24:17.052
'What has happened?!'

1:24:18.444 --> 1:24:19.402
'Please!'

1:24:19.489 --> 1:24:22.622

Let me in, please!'

1:25:26.164 --> 1:25:29.080
[footsteps approaching]

1:25:31.996 --> 1:25:35.478
Mr. Weightman's hosting the new
family for afternoon teas.

1:25:35.565 --> 1:25:37.306
Could you make a cake,
Emily Jane?

1:25:37.393 --> 1:25:40.613
And you're both expected to pass
the scones and pour the tea.

1:25:40.700 --> 1:25:42.920
I'm not feeling very well, aunt.

1:25:43.007 --> 1:25:44.530
- 'Emily Jane.'
- I won't do it!

1:25:44.617 --> 1:25:46.010
Emily.

1:25:46.097 --> 1:25:47.794
Do you want me to speak
to your father?

1:25:51.929 --> 1:25:52.886
[water sloshing]

1:25:54.323 --> 1:25:57.195
[birds chirping]

1:26:06.900 --> 1:26:07.858
[intense music]

1:26:09.860 --> 1:26:11.557
Emily! There you are.

1:26:12.645 --> 1:26:13.559
[cup clinks]

1:26:16.954 --> 1:26:17.911
[door creaking]

1:26:19.739 --> 1:26:20.653
It's a cake.

1:26:22.568 --> 1:26:24.396
[Weightman]
Do come in, Ms. Bronte.

1:26:24.483 --> 1:26:26.137
I don't know if it's any good.

1:26:26.224 --> 1:26:28.008
[indistinct chatter]

1:26:28.095 --> 1:26:29.314
Hello.

1:26:29.401 --> 1:26:30.489
[whispering]
Hello. Hello.

1:26:30.576 --> 1:26:31.534
Come, sit, sister.

1:26:32.796 --> 1:26:34.711
I cannot stay long.

1:26:34.798 --> 1:26:36.278
I think I'm coming down
with something.

1:26:36.365 --> 1:26:38.541
Oh, that's a pity.

1:26:38.628 --> 1:26:40.151
[Jonathan]
'It's hard in these
cooler months'

1:26:40.238 --> 1:26:41.631
'to hold onto one's vivacity.'

1:26:41.718 --> 1:26:43.502
Yes.

1:26:43.589 --> 1:26:46.766
Yes. Vivacity is an elusive
thing, Mr. Barker.

1:26:49.943 --> 1:26:50.901
Have you been well?

1:26:51.815 --> 1:26:54.034
Yes, quite well.

1:26:54.121 --> 1:26:55.558
No, I think the weather
is turning.

1:26:55.645 --> 1:26:58.125
- Do you not agree, Mr. Barker?
- Like one's nature.

1:26:58.213 --> 1:27:00.867
- Quite right, Ms. Bronte.
- Jonathan.

1:27:07.091 --> 1:27:09.267
Do you remember what you said
about your nature?

1:27:09.354 --> 1:27:10.660
No, I, um..

1:27:14.925 --> 1:27:15.882
Ms. Bronte!

1:27:40.951 --> 1:27:42.648
[breathes softly]

1:27:49.089 --> 1:27:50.047
[sighing]

1:27:53.659 --> 1:27:54.573
[glass shattering]

1:27:56.445 --> 1:27:58.011
[Charlotte]
'Mr. Weightman!'

1:27:58.098 --> 1:28:00.318
Your sister isn't feeling well
I'm afraid.

1:28:00.405 --> 1:28:02.842
What's happened?
What has happened?

1:28:06.063 --> 1:28:07.717
We have committed a mortal sin.

1:28:09.284 --> 1:28:10.981
God will not forgive me
for what I've done.

1:28:11.068 --> 1:28:12.852
But I must make amends, now you

1:28:12.939 --> 1:28:15.812
you'll stay away from me,
from now on, do you hear?

1:28:15.899 --> 1:28:16.813
I don't understand.

1:28:18.728 --> 1:28:20.904
I will call your father now
if you do not leave at once.

1:28:21.687 --> 1:28:22.601
No!

1:28:24.168 --> 1:28:26.518
- That night you wore the mask..
- Pardon?

1:28:26.605 --> 1:28:30.087
The night when I was first here,
you wore the mask.

1:28:30.174 --> 1:28:31.523
- We were playing the game.
- Yes.

1:28:31.610 --> 1:28:34.091
And you.. We..

1:28:34.178 --> 1:28:36.311
We.. Did you..?

1:28:38.313 --> 1:28:39.270
Did I what?

1:28:40.967 --> 1:28:42.926
Did I what?!

1:28:43.013 --> 1:28:43.970
- No, sorry!
- No!

1:28:44.057 --> 1:28:45.232
[indistinct chatter]

1:28:47.365 --> 1:28:49.411
Now I think there's something
ungodly in you..

1:28:52.370 --> 1:28:53.502
...in your writing.

1:28:53.589 --> 1:28:55.504
In your poetry, I..

1:28:55.591 --> 1:28:57.201
...I feel it
when we're together.

1:28:57.288 --> 1:28:59.769
- Listen, I..
- That's not true.

1:28:59.856 --> 1:29:02.032
I have stand in here.

1:29:02.119 --> 1:29:03.599
I'm-I'm respected over here.

1:29:03.686 --> 1:29:05.818
I, uh, I have worked to do.

1:29:08.647 --> 1:29:10.040
If you don't obey my wishes

1:29:10.127 --> 1:29:11.433
I will tell your father
all that you've done.

1:29:11.520 --> 1:29:13.522
All of it.
Do you understand me?

1:29:13.609 --> 1:29:15.219
Please, don't do that!

1:29:15.306 --> 1:29:16.263
[sighs]

1:29:16.351 --> 1:29:18.788
- Go.
- Please!

1:29:18.875 --> 1:29:19.919
- Ple..
- Go!

1:29:23.358 --> 1:29:24.315
Go!

1:29:25.229 --> 1:29:27.144
[thunderclaps]

1:29:28.537 --> 1:29:30.408
[crying]

1:29:45.118 --> 1:29:47.904
[rain pattering]

1:29:49.340 --> 1:29:51.342
You look tired.

1:29:51.429 --> 1:29:54.127
It's very busy at the parsonage.

1:29:54.214 --> 1:29:56.652
I haven't heard from Anne.

1:29:56.739 --> 1:29:58.828
Charlotte's got a teaching
position in Brussels.

1:29:58.915 --> 1:30:01.004
Bully for her.

1:30:01.091 --> 1:30:03.398
- Father and Aunt B.
- 'Fine.'

1:30:05.748 --> 1:30:06.662
[Branwell]
'How's Weightman?'

1:30:08.838 --> 1:30:09.752
He's well.

1:30:11.406 --> 1:30:13.886
- Did you get my second chapter?
- Yes.

1:30:13.973 --> 1:30:17.237
[Branwell]
'What did you think of it?'

1:30:17.324 --> 1:30:18.500
What did you think of it?

1:30:18.587 --> 1:30:19.501
Honestly?

1:30:25.507 --> 1:30:27.073
Well, it's..

1:30:27.160 --> 1:30:30.033
[breathing deeply]

1:30:30.120 --> 1:30:33.776
It's the most self important
overwritten piece of writing.

1:30:33.863 --> 1:30:36.256
And, lazy.

1:30:36.343 --> 1:30:37.867
I've never read such
lazy writing.

1:30:39.216 --> 1:30:41.392
- Pardon?
- It's unclear.

1:30:41.479 --> 1:30:44.134
I couldn't understand what was
going on half the time.

1:30:44.221 --> 1:30:46.005
And the thing that really
upsets me is that

1:30:46.092 --> 1:30:47.964
you obviously don't have any
perspective on what a truly

1:30:48.051 --> 1:30:50.314
terrible,
terrible writer you are.

1:30:50.401 --> 1:30:52.490
'Honestly, it's laughable.'

1:30:52.577 --> 1:30:54.971
'Your characters wander
about aimlessly.'

1:30:55.058 --> 1:30:57.974
Soppy descriptions of hills
and mountains.

1:30:58.061 --> 1:30:59.889
And your lead characters have
about as much depth as one of

1:30:59.976 --> 1:31:03.240
your sketches, which is
so obviously stolen from Byron.

1:31:03.327 --> 1:31:05.024
And it seemed as difficult
for you to avoid a cliche

1:31:05.111 --> 1:31:07.679
as it is for you to
avoid a drink.

1:31:07.766 --> 1:31:09.899
And that's saying something,
because you sit here

1:31:09.986 --> 1:31:13.642
off your head most of the time
on what is it this week, opium?

1:31:13.729 --> 1:31:15.426
Gin?

1:31:15.513 --> 1:31:17.036
Rum, is it rum?

1:31:17.123 --> 1:31:19.038
You sit here in this hole

1:31:19.125 --> 1:31:21.040
at your little desk
with your little bed

1:31:21.127 --> 1:31:22.912
all hopeful and perfect
about the future

1:31:22.999 --> 1:31:24.522
and all the lovely things
that will happen to you!

1:31:24.609 --> 1:31:26.306
It's pathetic!

1:31:26.393 --> 1:31:29.048
[gasps]
I don't know how you
get through the day.

1:31:29.135 --> 1:31:31.834
[thunderclaps]

1:31:31.921 --> 1:31:33.792
Please.

1:31:33.879 --> 1:31:36.926
[Emily]
'Oh, that's right.
We know, don't we?'

1:31:37.013 --> 1:31:37.927
[exhales]

1:31:41.974 --> 1:31:43.019
[whispers]
I have to go.

1:31:43.106 --> 1:31:44.020
[cup clinking]

1:31:46.022 --> 1:31:47.414
I hope you fall in love someday.

1:31:51.593 --> 1:31:54.204
So I can be like you?

1:31:54.291 --> 1:31:57.250
[Branwell]
'So you can bleed,
like the rest of us.'

1:31:58.861 --> 1:32:00.515
I'll never be like you.

1:32:00.602 --> 1:32:02.386
[chuckling softly]
You are me.

1:32:02.473 --> 1:32:04.693
Mystic as well as a psychic now?
You seem a little

1:32:04.780 --> 1:32:06.477
'over qualified
for your current employment.'

1:32:06.564 --> 1:32:08.697
Let's not fight. I'm-I'm so glad
that you've come.

1:32:08.784 --> 1:32:10.655
- I have to go.
- But y-you just got here.

1:32:10.742 --> 1:32:12.527
- This is from father. Money!
- No, No, I--

1:32:12.614 --> 1:32:15.051
- No, no. I don't want--
- Take it.

1:32:15.138 --> 1:32:17.009
[coins clinking]

1:32:17.096 --> 1:32:19.229
You'll need something to buy
whatever it is you need now.

1:32:23.494 --> 1:32:24.713
Yes, of course.

1:32:26.366 --> 1:32:27.324
Thank you.

1:32:32.938 --> 1:32:35.114
Em, did you really think
that about my writing?

1:32:37.639 --> 1:32:38.640
I-is it..

1:32:45.864 --> 1:32:48.258
Well, thank you.

1:32:48.345 --> 1:32:51.087
Alright, I will, I will try
and do better from now on.

1:32:51.174 --> 1:32:53.872
I'll, uh.. Alright?

1:32:53.959 --> 1:32:54.917
Really will.

1:32:55.004 --> 1:32:55.918
[thunderclaps]

1:32:58.442 --> 1:32:59.399

[shuddering]

1:34:15.867 --> 1:34:16.781
[sniffles]

1:34:25.094 --> 1:34:26.008
Shall we begin?

1:34:41.763 --> 1:34:43.112
Turn to page 71.

1:34:46.245 --> 1:34:47.159
[page rustling]

1:34:55.037 --> 1:34:58.649
There's a French verb tense

1:34:58.736 --> 1:35:00.825
for past participle negative.

1:35:00.912 --> 1:35:03.262
- We haven't covered yet.
- Hmm.

1:35:03.349 --> 1:35:05.090
Yes, it's quite tricky,
isn't it?

1:35:09.921 --> 1:35:10.922
[knocks on door]

1:35:11.009 --> 1:35:12.663
- Come.
- Papa.

1:35:13.969 --> 1:35:15.448
[Patrick]
'What is it, child?'

1:35:15.535 --> 1:35:17.886
Emily's decided to travel
with me to Brussels.

1:35:17.973 --> 1:35:20.018
Are you sure, Emily Jane?

1:35:21.324 --> 1:35:24.153
- Yes, papa.
- 'Very well.'

1:35:24.240 --> 1:35:26.111
[fire crackling]

1:35:26.198 --> 1:35:27.765
[Patrick]
'So you're all prepared?'

1:35:27.852 --> 1:35:29.245
- 'Yes.'
- 'Good, good.'

1:35:29.332 --> 1:35:30.942
- 'Goodnight, papa.'
- 'Goodnight, child.'

1:35:31.029 --> 1:35:32.770
- 'Goodnight, Aunt Branwell.'
- 'Goodnight, Emily.'

1:35:36.165 --> 1:35:37.122
Ms. Bronte.

1:35:37.209 --> 1:35:38.689
'Good evening.'

1:35:38.776 --> 1:35:40.865
It's very exciting news
about-about Brussels.

1:35:40.952 --> 1:35:42.432
Are-are you looking forward
to it?

1:35:42.519 --> 1:35:43.433
Yes, thank you, I am.

1:35:46.218 --> 1:35:48.351
Perhaps, perhaps
you will find some inspiration

1:35:48.438 --> 1:35:50.005
there for-for your writing.

1:35:50.092 --> 1:35:51.920
Oh, I do not write anymore.

1:35:52.007 --> 1:35:53.356
I'm to be a teacher.

1:35:56.185 --> 1:35:57.708
Ah..

1:35:57.795 --> 1:35:59.405
What?

1:35:59.492 --> 1:36:00.493
Goodnight, curate.

1:36:02.887 --> 1:36:04.236
But maybe if..

1:36:05.585 --> 1:36:08.545
You-you must write, eh,
Ms. Bronte.

1:36:10.503 --> 1:36:12.070
I'm very tired, Mr. Weightman.

1:36:13.550 --> 1:36:17.467
Yes, uh, apologies. Um..

1:36:17.554 --> 1:36:20.296
I-I shall see you at-at the
morning tea tomorrow.

1:36:20.383 --> 1:36:21.732
I have to pack in the morning.

1:36:23.168 --> 1:36:24.779
Yes, of-of course.

the plums?

1:36:56.245 --> 1:36:57.899
They are actually from
the garden.

Shouldn't you be heading off
now, brother?

It's the long walk back.

the night.'

'You're staying to see us off?'

1:38:38.042 --> 1:38:40.218
- That's very kind.
- Yeah.

1:38:43.961 --> 1:38:44.919
You're here.

1:38:47.878 --> 1:38:49.836
I'm sorry for the things
I said that day.

1:38:52.100 --> 1:38:53.318
My mind wasn't right.

1:38:54.885 --> 1:38:55.930
It was the truth though.

1:39:00.847 --> 1:39:01.805
I'm not a writer.

1:39:04.155 --> 1:39:05.374
'Read your poem, by the way.'

1:39:08.943 --> 1:39:09.900
It's brilliant.

1:39:13.034 --> 1:39:15.079
Perhaps the most beautiful thing
I've ever read.

He didn't sleep in his bed

No, no, no.
I'm sure I can find him.

1:59:32.513 --> 1:59:34.210
That's how I wrote my story.

1:59:38.649 --> 1:59:39.607
I loved him, you know.

1:59:42.436 --> 1:59:43.350
Who?

The music was in my ears.

2:00:03.196 --> 2:00:05.502
Oh, it was so full.

Will you do something for me,
my love?

The chest under our bed.

2:00:20.604 --> 2:00:21.518

[Emily]
'Do you promise me?'

Of course.

<i>Do you remember</i>
<i>when we were little..</i>

2:02:30.647 --> 2:02:32.867
'...how you would tell me
stories?'

2:02:32.954 --> 2:02:34.303
[breathing heavily]

2:02:36.131 --> 2:02:38.394
I used to love listening
to your stories.

You did?

2:02:46.924 --> 2:02:49.797
