00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,150
<i>Once upon a time, in
a magical kingdom known as Andalasia,</i>

2
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:02,050
<i>there lived an evil queen.</i>

3
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:03,650
<i>Selfish and cruel,</i>

4
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>she lived in fear that one day
her stepson would marry,</i>

5
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:11,250
<i>and she would
lose her throne forever.</i>

6
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:16,850
<i>And so, she did all in her power
to prevent the prince from ever meeting</i>

7
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,950
<i>the one special maiden with whom
he would share true love's kiss.</i>

8
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:26,250
Giselle, Giselle,
how about this for your statue?

9
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:29,450
- Oh, this will be perfect. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,350
Come on! OK, you mookses, move it!
We have got a face to put together here

11
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,950
while it's still ingrained
in her subcranium.

12
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,450
Oh, Pip, it was
such a lovely dream.

13
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:41,550
We were holding hands
and dancing, and...

14
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,150
- Oh!
- And these for the eyes.

15
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:45,550
Blue? Oh, how did you know?

16
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,550
And they sparkle just like his. Mm!

17
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,850
OK. There we go.

18
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:55,750
- Yes! That's it!
- OK. Yeah, yeah.

19
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,950
- Floor's yours, honey.
- Presenting my one true love.

20
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,950
My prince. My dream come true.

21
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,350
Oh, my goodness!

22
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:11,950
- Whoa, whoa. What? What's the problem?
- I didn't give him any lips.

23
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,650
- Ooh!
- Does he have to have lips?

24
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,650
Of course.

25
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,350
When you meet the someone
who is meant for you

26
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:25,250
<i>Before two can become one
There's something you must do</i>

27
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:29,150
- Do you pull each other's tails?
- Do you feed each other seeds?

28
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,750
No.

29
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,150
<i>There is something sweeter</i>

30
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:38,050
<i>Everybody needs</i>

31
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,650
<i>I've been dreaming
of a true love's kiss</i>

32
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:46,550
<i>And a prince
I'm hoping comes with this</i>

33
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:48,550
<i>That's what brings</i>

34
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:52,750
<i>Ever-afterings so happy</i>

35
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:58,450
<i>And that's the reason
we need lips so much</i>

36
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,450
<i>For lips are the
only things that touch</i>

37
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:03,950
<i>So to spend</i>

38
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,250
<i>A life of endless bliss</i>

39
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,950
<i>Just find who you love</i>

40
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:16,350
<i>Through true love's kiss</i>

41
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,150
If we're going to find
a perfect pair of lips,

42
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,650
we're going to need
a lot more help.

43
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:36,950
<i>She's been dreaming
of a true love's kiss</i>

44
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,850
<i>And a prince she's hoping
comes with this</i>

45
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:44,350
<i>That's what brings
ever-afterings</i>

46
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:48,550
<i>- So happy
- So happy</i>

47
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,150
<i>That's the reason
we need lips so much</i>

48
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:56,250
<i>For lips are the
only things that touch</i>

49
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,350
Humph!

50
00:03:58,450 --> 00:04:02,450
<i>So to spend a life</i>

51
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,850
<i>Of endless bliss</i>

52
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,450
<i>Just find who you love</i>

53
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:15,350
<i>Through true love's kiss</i>

54
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,250
Look out below!

55
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,950
Look out below!

56
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:23,450
Amazing, sire.

57
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,950
Your tenth troll this month.

58
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:30,150
Oh, I love hunting trolls.

59
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,050
Big trolls, little trolls.
Trolls, trolls, trolls...

60
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,850
- Sorry.
- Oh, that's OK.

61
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,650
Ah, trolls are fine
to pass the time, Nathaniel,

62
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:43,750
but... but my heart longs
to be joined in song.

63
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,550
<i>I've been dreaming
of a true love's kiss</i>

64
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,950
<i>- And a...
-... prince I'm hoping</i>

65
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:53,850
<i>- Comes with this
- Do you hear that, Nathaniel?</i>

66
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,650
Me? No.
No, I hear nothing.

67
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,850
Nothing.

68
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,350
- Oh!
- I must find the maiden

69
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,150
- that belongs to that sweet voice.
- Oh, no! Come back, sire.

70
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,650
- No, you're hallucinating!
- Ride, Destiny!

71
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,150
Oh!

72
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,650
Oh, pooh. Oh, no.
No. This isn't good.

73
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:17,550
All these years of troll chasing, trying
to keep him from ever meeting a girl.

74
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:21,450
Oh, the queen.
No, she's not going to like this.

75
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,350
<i>True love's kiss</i>

76
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:35,350
<i>True love's kiss</i>

77
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,450
<i>True love's kiss</i>

78
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,150
Oh, you shall not prevail, foul troll.
That maiden is mine!

79
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:49,550
Honey, do you really think
your dream boy exists?

80
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:53,350
Oh, Pip. I know he's
out there somewhere.

81
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,550
Eye! Eye! Eye-Eye.

82
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,350
- I... I what?
- I eat you now.

83
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,050
Everybody, scatter!

84
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:05,550
Gotcha. Huh?

85
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,950
Hey! That's cheating!

86
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:13,050
I supposed to eat you.

87
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:14,950
Oh, no you don't,
you big lug.

88
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,250
Oh? Oh!

89
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:20,750
Ah!

90
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:23,750
Wow, I got to lay off the nuts.

91
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,650
Girl yummy.

92
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,750
Fear not, fair maiden.
I am here.

93
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,350
- Whoa!
- Gotcha!

94
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,450
Whoa!

95
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,250
Uh-oh. Whoo!

96
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,750
Oh! Pip!

97
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:47,650
Just hang on, honey.
I'm going to...

98
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,850
Ow! Ow! Ow!

99
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,850
Oh, my gosh.

100
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,050
- It's you.
- Yes, it's me.

101
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,750
- And you are?
- Giselle.

102
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,650
Oh! Giselle! We shall be
married in the morning.

103
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:09,650
<i>You're the fairest maid
I've ever met</i>

104
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,350
<i>- You were made...
- To finish your duet</i>

105
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,550
<i>And in years
to come we'll reminisce</i>

106
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,950
<i>How we came to love</i>

107
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,550
<i>And grew and grew love</i>

108
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:30,150
<i>Since first we knew love</i>

109
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:36,150
<i>Through true love's kiss</i>

110
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,850
Oh, so this is the little forest rat

111
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:55,250
who thinks she
can steal my throne.

112
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,750
Never!

113
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,150
Oh! Excuse me.
I am so sorry.

114
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,250
- Oh! Am I late?
- No, miss.

115
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,750
- I do hope I'm not late.
- Just in time.

116
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:23,350
- Oh, thank goodness.
- Hey, honey, wait up!

117
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:27,550
- We ain't done with you yet.
- No! Ah!

118
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,750
Oy!

119
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,850
- Oh! Thank you.
- You're welcome, Giselle.

120
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,350
You're getting married!

121
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:48,350
Oh, and what do we look like, garbage?

122
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:51,150
- Close the door on me!
- If you'll allow me...

123
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:54,150
To think that in a few moments
that Edward and I...

124
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,950
- Yes, yes.
- That he and me... That we...

125
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,750
Oh, my.

126
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:02,850
Oh, what a lovely bride.

127
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,250
That's very kind of you,

128
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:05,650
- but I really...
- No, no!

129
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:09,450
- Granny has a wedding gift for you.
- Thank you.

130
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:12,950
But I really should be going.
You see, I'm going...

131
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,950
- 'Tis a wishing well, dear.
- Oh!

132
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:18,450
But all my wishes
are about to come true.

133
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:21,850
If I ever see that fat mook's
face again, I'm gonna...

134
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,650
I really do have to go.

135
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,850
But a wish on your wedding day.

136
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:30,850
That's the most magical of all.

137
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:35,850
Just close your eyes,
my darling, and make your wish.

138
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,850
That's right. That's right.
Lean in close.

139
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,750
- Are you wishing for something?
- Yes, I am.

140
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,650
And they both lived happily
ever aft...

141
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,450
Help! Edward!
Prince Edward, we need help!

142
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,950
Speciosus, formosus, praeclarus!

143
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:02,250
Where, my most adored queen,
where did you send her?

144
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:07,450
To a place where there
are no "happily ever afters."

145
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:18,750
Oh! Oh.

146
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,850
Oh!

147
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:25,550
What is this?

148
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,150
Oh!

149
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,350
Oh!

150
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,950
Oh!

151
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,250
Oh!

152
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,650
Oh!

153
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,950
Oh!

154
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:34,150
- Get out of the street!
- Oh!

155
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:36,450
- Oh!
- Whoa!

156
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:40,650
Lady! Are you crazy? Now you
have to pay for all of this.

157
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,850
I'm sorry. Excuse me.
I was wondering if one of you

158
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:47,650
kind people might
direct me to the castle?

159
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:51,250
Oh!

160
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:54,250
Hey, watch it, will you?

161
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:59,250
- Grumpy!
- Jeez, lady. Are you for real?

162
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,550
I think so. Oh, wait! Wait!

163
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,150
Where are you going? Please, if you
could just point me to the castle?

164
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,550
Where are you going? Please, if you
could just point me to the castle?

165
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:11,150
I'm supposed to be at the ball
to wed my true love,

166
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:14,750
Prince Ed... Oh! Edward!

167
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,750
Edward?

168
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:21,450
Oh! Edward!

169
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:41,450
Edward?

170
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,750
Oh, no.

171
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,050
Oh! Hello, old man! Oh!

172
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,850
Hello.

173
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,150
May I sit with you?

174
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,850
Oh!

175
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:02,250
I'm very tired, and I'm scared.

176
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:04,750
I've never been this far away
from home before,

177
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:07,450
and I'm not sure at all where I am.

178
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:10,350
If somebody could show me
just a bit of kindness,

179
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,450
a friendly "hello" or even a smile,

180
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,250
I'm sure that would
lift my spirits so much.

181
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:22,750
Oh. You have a lovely smile.

182
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,050
Oh! Where are you going?

183
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:31,250
That's mine!
Bring that back here!

184
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:35,850
You! Come back here!
I need that!

185
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,450
Oh! Please?

186
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,650
You...

187
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:42,450
...are not a very nice old man!

188
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,450
No way you're getting him,
Ethan.

189
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,850
- You want him because I want him.
- I'm not letting you have him!

190
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:02,750
- Forget it. Hank is coming with me.
- Wait a minute, guys.

191
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,450
- I'm getting confused. Who is Hank?
- Hank Aaron.

192
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:09,050
Milwaukee Braves?
His 1954 rookie card.

193
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,850
A baseball card?

194
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,250
That's what this gets down to
is a baseball card?

195
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,850
You never loved Hank like me.

196
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:18,750
- You never loved me like Hank!
- How did I make you so angry?

197
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,750
- Robert?
- Yes?

198
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:22,050
- It's time.
- Ask what you didn't do.

199
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,750
- It's a longer list!
- What would you do if you...?

200
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,650
I have to pick up my daughter.
Can we do this around 9:00?

201
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,350
- 9:00 sounds good.
- Great. I'll see you then.

202
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:32,350
Phoebe, I'll see you in the morning, OK?

203
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:34,450
You're just afraid
I don't need you!

204
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:36,250
- I need a vacation!
- Thank you.

205
00:15:36,350 --> 00:15:39,150
After a whole day of that,
you still want to get engaged?

206
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,750
Those people got married
on a crazy romantic whim.

207
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,650
It's not like that with Nancy and I.

208
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:46,450
Right. None of that crazy romantic
stuff for you, huh?

209
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:47,550
Oh, come on.

210
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,950
I mean, we're rational.

211
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,650
We understand each other's
strengths and weaknesses.

212
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,650
Sounds like building a bridge.
Have you told your daughter?

213
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,950
No, I haven't. Not yet.

214
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,450
I'm going to tonight.
I got a present to ease her into it.

215
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,350
With news like this, I hope you
got her a Shetland pony.

216
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:05,850
No. Something much better than that.

217
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,950
- A book?
- Oh, come on. Don't give me that look.

218
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:17,550
I know it's not that fairy tale book
you wanted, but this is better.

219
00:16:17,650 --> 00:16:20,850
Look at this. See?
Rosa Parks.

220
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,050
Madame Curie.

221
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,750
She was a remarkable woman who
dedicated her life to research...

222
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:29,450
...until she died from...

223
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:33,250
...radiation poisoning.
- She... died?

224
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:36,550
I wonder who that is.

225
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,050
Yeah, hi.

226
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:42,650
Tomorrow morning
would be great. 7:30?

227
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,650
<i>- With her now?
- Yes, let me call you later.</i>

228
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:48,050
All right. Bye-bye.

229
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,950
It was Nancy.

230
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,550
- Mm-hmm?
- Mm-hmm.

231
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:57,150
She's a lot like
the women in your book.

232
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:00,350
Sweetie...

233
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,550
...I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

234
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:07,850
- What?
- Yeah, you like her, don't you?

235
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,450
We all get along.

236
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:12,250
- Where's she going to live?
- She's going to live with us.

237
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:14,050
Do I have to give up my bedroom?

238
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,950
No, you don't have
to give up your bedroom. No.

239
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:20,050
Come on, it's going to be great.
I promise.

240
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:23,450
It's not like she's gonna
try and be your mother.

241
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:26,150
- Stepmother.
- She's gonna be a nice stepmother.

242
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:29,150
She's gonna take you
to school tomorrow, just you and her,

243
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:31,350
for some grown-up girl-bonding time.

244
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,750
I'm only six.

245
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:35,450
You won't always be.

246
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:10,150
Hello!

247
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,450
It's me, Giselle, from Andalasia.

248
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,650
Hello!

249
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,150
Hello!

250
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,550
Is there anybody home?

251
00:18:21,650 --> 00:18:23,150
Hello, please open the door.

252
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,750
It's very cold out here.

253
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,550
Daddy, why is there a princess
on the castle billboard?

254
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,650
It's an advertisement.
It's a mannequin.

255
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:35,050
- She's really there!
- No, she's not. What are you doing?

256
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,550
Get back in here! Stop!

257
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,350
- Morgan! Stop!
- Hey!

258
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,950
- Princess!
- Morgan!

259
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,650
- Don't you ever do that again!
- Look! Look!

260
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,150
Is anybody there?
Do you know Edward?

261
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,250
- Stay here.
- Oh, please be home!

262
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,350
- Hey, lady!
- Oh, hello.

263
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:55,650
I was wondering if maybe you...
Whoa!

264
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,550
Hang on!

265
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,550
- Oh!
- Don't let go! Wait!

266
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,750
- Just hang on!
- Oh, no!

267
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,050
Catch her, Daddy!

268
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:15,750
- Oh!
- Ow!

269
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,850
- You OK?
- I'm fine.

270
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:21,950
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

271
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:26,250
- What were you doing up there?
- I was looking for some help.

272
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:29,150
You see, I've been wandering
very far and long tonight,

273
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,250
and I'm afraid nobody's
been nice to me.

274
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,150
Yeah, well, welcome to New York.

275
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,650
Thank you.

276
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,550
Right. OK,
you sure you're all right?

277
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:42,750
- Oh, yes.
- You need me to call somebody for you?

278
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:45,450
Well, I don't think
they'd hear you from here.

279
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:48,250
What?

280
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,350
Morgan, show her the way, please.

281
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:57,950
And then
the old hag told me to...

282
00:19:58,050 --> 00:20:00,850
Oh! ...look into the well
and wish for my heart's desire.

283
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:03,250
But I must have looked very far

284
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:07,050
because I fell,
down, down, down.

285
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:09,250
And then I climbed out
of this big, round hole

286
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:12,250
and I got very lost,
until I fell off of the castle.

287
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:15,350
- And now here I am with you!
- Is this a big habit of yours?

288
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:16,450
Falling off stuff?

289
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:19,050
Well, usually someone catches me.

290
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:23,550
But, not to worry, I'm certain that
Edward is already searching for me.

291
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:27,650
No doubt by morning he'll come
and rescue me from this strange land.

292
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:31,750
Take me home, and the two of us
can share in true love's kiss.

293
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,850
True love's kiss?

294
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,450
It's the most powerful thing
in the world.

295
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,550
Right.

296
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,450
Now if I could only find a place
to rest my head for the night.

297
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:42,550
- What kind of place?
- Oh, I don't know.

298
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:45,550
Maybe a nearby meadow
or a hollow tree.

299
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:47,050
A hollow tree?

300
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:50,450
Or a house full of dwarves.
I hear they're very hospitable.

301
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:54,250
All I can do is let you in for a minute.
Dry off, use the phone if you want to.

302
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,850
We have our own bedtime
to stick to. Let's go.

303
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:59,650
That's very kind of you.

304
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:05,550
- What is it with this dress of yours?
- Oh. Do you like it?

305
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,550
- No, it's just...
- I gathered the silk

306
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,950
from my silkworms and I spun it
into thread on my spinning wheel.

307
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:14,350
- You made it all by yourself?
- Well, the mice and rabbits

308
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,050
did help with the sewing.

309
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,350
- They're good!
- Oh!

310
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,050
Whoa!

311
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:28,250
Why don't we see about
getting you a car.

312
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:34,550
- Couldn't she sleep here, Daddy?
- No. That's a big no.

313
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,550
- Are you really a princess?
- Not yet.

314
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,650
But...

315
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,550
...I will be soon.

316
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:01,550
Wow, Dad.
She's really sleepy.

317
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:05,150
Oh, no.
That's not acceptable. No.

318
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:08,250
You're not really gonna
make her go, are you, Daddy?

319
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,550
I want you to go to bed.

320
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,050
But I think she might be
a real princess.

321
00:22:12,150 --> 00:22:16,850
Morgan, just because she has on a funny
dress, doesn't mean she's a princess.

322
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,650
She is a seriously confused woman
who's fallen into our laps.

323
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,050
- So we're not going to let her stay?
- No.

324
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,450
Put on your nightgown
and go to sleep.

325
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,950
Good night, OK?

326
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:37,550
Hi. I need a car
at 116th and Riverside, please.

327
00:22:37,550 --> 00:22:39,850
<i>- Hold, please.
- Thank you.</i>

328
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:55,850
<i>Hello, sir.
Destination, please.</i>

329
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:57,550
<i>Sir?</i>

330
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:13,050
- Morgan.
- What?

331
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,950
I want you to sleep
in my room tonight.

332
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,950
- Why?
- Just come on.

333
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,850
All right.

334
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,450
Fear not, Giselle!
I will rescue you!

335
00:23:29,550 --> 00:23:34,250
Yeah, but who's
gonna rescue me?

336
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:38,350
- All right, let's close it up.
- Whoa!

337
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:42,150
- Hey, buddy! You ain't...
- Silence!

338
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,550
Guys, I got it.

339
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:46,150
- Your name, peasant! Quickly!
- Arty.

340
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,550
Are you in league with
the wicked old hag who sent

341
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:51,550
my poor Giselle
to this foul place, Arty?

342
00:23:55,650 --> 00:23:59,450
Is this man party
to this evil plot, chipmunk?

343
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:13,450
- Uh-oh.
- Aw, poor chipmunk.

344
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,150
Speechless in my presence.

345
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:18,450
What say you, sir?
Don't try my patience.

346
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,450
- What are you talking about?
- I seek a beautiful girl.

347
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:23,650
My other half,
my one coquette,

348
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,450
the answer
to my love's duet.

349
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:27,250
I'd like to
find one of them too.

350
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:30,550
Then keep a wary eye out, Arty.

351
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,050
- Come along, Pip.
- Are you OK?

352
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,850
Hey!

353
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:39,150
Hey! Get off the car, you nut!

354
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,550
Did you see that chipmunk?

355
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:14,550
Oh, my.

356
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,850
This just won't do.

357
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,150
Whoa!

358
00:25:51,350 --> 00:25:55,450
Oh, my goodness.
Are you all right?

359
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,450
Oh.

360
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:01,850
Hello.

361
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,850
Oh...

362
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:14,450
Well, it's always nice
to make new friends.

363
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,750
All right, everyone,
let's tidy things up.

364
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,950
<i>Come, my little friends as we all sing
a happy little working song</i>

365
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,150
<i>Merry little voices
Clear and strong</i>

366
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:28,150
<i>Come and roll your
sleeves up so to speak</i>

367
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:31,750
<i>And pitch in cleaning
crud up in the kitchen</i>

368
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:34,950
<i>As we sing along</i>

369
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:39,650
<i>Trill a cheery tune in the tub
as you scrub a stubborn mildew stain</i>

370
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,150
<i>Pluck a hairball
from the shower drain</i>

371
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,150
<i>To that gay refrain
of a happy working song</i>

372
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,250
<i>We'll keep singing
without fail</i>

373
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,750
<i>Otherwise we'd spoil it</i>

374
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:57,450
<i>Hosing down the garbage pail
and scrubbing up the toilet</i>

375
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:01,450
<i>How we all enjoy letting loose with
a little "la da dum dum dum"</i>

376
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:04,350
<i>While we're emptying the vacu-um</i>

377
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,550
<i>It's such fun</i>

378
00:27:05,650 --> 00:27:09,250
<i>- To hum a happy working song
- Ooh</i>

379
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,150
<i>A happy working song</i>

380
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,850
<i>Oh, how strange
a place to be</i>

381
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,350
<i>Till Edward comes for me</i>

382
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:24,050
<i>My heart is sighing</i>

383
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:27,850
<i>Still, as long as I am here</i>

384
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:32,050
<i>I guess a new experience</i>

385
00:27:32,050 --> 00:27:34,850
<i>Could be worth trying</i>

386
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:37,950
<i>Hey, keep drying</i>

387
00:27:38,050 --> 00:27:40,150
<i>You can do a lot
when you've got such</i>

388
00:27:40,250 --> 00:27:42,650
<i>A happy working tune to hum</i>

389
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,850
<i>While you're sponging up
the soapy scum</i>

390
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:48,950
<i>We adore each filthy chore
that we determine</i>

391
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,550
<i>So, friends even though
you're vermin</i>

392
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:57,550
<i>We're a happy working throng</i>

393
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,050
<i>Singing as we fetch
the detergent box</i>

394
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:03,150
<i>For the smelly shirts
and the stinky socks</i>

395
00:28:03,250 --> 00:28:04,950
<i>Sing along</i>

396
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,850
<i>If you cannot sing
Then hum along</i>

397
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:13,450
<i>As we're finishing
our happy working song</i>

398
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,650
Ah.

399
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,250
Wasn't this fun?

400
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:25,450
- Wake up, wake up!
- What?

401
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,250
- Wake up!
- What is it?

402
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,850
- Come, you have to come see!
- What is it?

403
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,750
I can't tell you.
You have to come see!

404
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,250
What's wrong? Are you OK?

405
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:37,950
- Yes. What is it, Morgan?
- Look!

406
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,350
Oh, my gosh. Get out! Out!

407
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:48,250
- What do I do with them?
- Get them outside.

408
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,050
- Get rid of them.
- Put them back?

409
00:28:50,050 --> 00:28:52,250
Put them outside!
Don't put them back.

410
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,550
Open the door!

411
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,650
Good! Watch out!

412
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,850
- Stay there.
- But, Dad.

413
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,650
Shh. Stay there.

414
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,050
- Hello.
- Come in!

415
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:23,250
- Yeah, can I...
- Oh. Good morning, Robert.

416
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:27,250
Oh! That's too thoughtful of you.

417
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,950
Thank you! Oh, I hope
you had nice dreams.

418
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:35,650
- I think I'm still in one.
- This is a magical room.

419
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,550
Where does the water come from?

420
00:29:37,550 --> 00:29:42,150
Uh, well, the water comes
from the pipes.

421
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:46,650
- And where do the pipes get it?
- Uh, I don't know. From...

422
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:51,350
...wherever the pipes get it.
- Oh.

423
00:29:51,450 --> 00:29:53,050
It is magical.

424
00:29:58,550 --> 00:30:01,450
- Hey, girlfriend.
- Hi, Nancy.

425
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:04,150
What do you say,
you ready to kick it?

426
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,950
Kick what?

427
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,850
Why do you still have your PJ's on?

428
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,350
It's been pretty busy around here.

429
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:15,150
Wow.
It's really neat in here.

430
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:19,650
- Did you guys get a maid?
- No. Not exactly.

431
00:30:19,650 --> 00:30:22,150
Don't worry.
My friends will do that.

432
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:27,050
Oh!

433
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:30,650
- Nancy?
- Oh, hello!

434
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,750
- Who is this?
- This is nothing.

435
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,450
- I'm Giselle!
- This is nobody.

436
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,750
I was on my way to the castle
to get married...

437
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:38,350
- She's married?
- No, she's not.

438
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:40,750
- Not yet!
- What does that mean, "yet"?

439
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:44,050
- She was lost. I was trying to help.
- With finding the shower?

440
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:46,550
The shower.
The shower is wonderful, Nancy.

441
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,050
- I'm sure it is.
- That's enough. Thank you.

442
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:52,050
- Calm down. Please, let's talk.
- Talk about what, Robert?

443
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,550
How I never stay the night?
Because we both agreed,

444
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,250
Morgan's here, and you have
to maintain boundaries

445
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:59,550
and I thought,
"I'm so lucky. He's sensitive!"

446
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:02,350
I didn't realize you were
worried about crowd control.

447
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,050
- We'll talk.
- Don't bet on it.

448
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:07,350
What about taking Morgan?
Some grown-up girl-bonding time.

449
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:11,150
What, so you can have some
grown-up girl-bonding time?

450
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:13,850
- I don't think so.
- But... just...

451
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:14,950
Goodbye!

452
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,450
Oh, she is lovely.

453
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,450
Get dressed, please.
For school.

454
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,750
Just... Please.

455
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,150
- Nancy!
- Thirty-eight and Seventh.

456
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:31,050
Nancy, wait!

457
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,450
- Hello?
- You got to go.

458
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:42,050
I don't know what your deal is,
if you're waiting for Prince Charming...

459
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,950
- Prince Edward!
- Whatever.

460
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,550
I'll get you to a bus,
a train, a plane, wherever,

461
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:49,850
and then that's it!
I can't get involved after that.

462
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,550
What is this?

463
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:59,450
- Where did you get that?
- I made it.

464
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,650
Do you like it?

465
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,450
You're unhappy.

466
00:32:04,550 --> 00:32:06,650
You made a dress out of my curtains?

467
00:32:06,650 --> 00:32:09,450
Oh, you are unhappy.
I am so sorry.

468
00:32:09,550 --> 00:32:12,350
- I'm not unhappy, I'm angry.
- Angry?

469
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:14,750
It's an unpleasant emotion.
Ever heard of it?

470
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:18,050
- I have heard of it, but I...
- You have created a completely

471
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:21,550
unnecessary problem with Nancy
that I now have to resolve.

472
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:23,950
See, the fact is,
I was just getting ready

473
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,550
to take a very serious step forward.

474
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,750
- A proposal, actually.
- Oh!

475
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:31,250
Well, now she's got it
in her mind that you and I...

476
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:35,550
- Kissed?
- Yeah, something like that.

477
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,850
Oh, no.

478
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:41,450
- You should sing to her!
- Sing to her?

479
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:44,350
And maybe that would reassure
her of your affections!

480
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:47,950
You need to rush to her side
and hold her in your arms

481
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:52,550
and then pour your heart out
in a beautiful ballad.

482
00:32:52,650 --> 00:32:56,150
And then she'll know for sure.

483
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:00,350
- Why are you staring at me?
- I don't know.

484
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:03,650
It's like you escaped from
a Hallmark card or something.

485
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:06,750
Is that a bad thing?

486
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:10,350
School! We're late!
We've got to run!

487
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,450
Oh!

488
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:22,450
Oh, wouldn't she just love to come
crawling back here and steal my crown!

489
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:26,450
Cast me aside like
so much royal rubbish! What?

490
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:29,650
Perhaps Prince Edward won't find her.

491
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:32,050
- Perhaps he will!
- Oh! Oh, dear.

492
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:39,250
Oh...

493
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:44,550
Oh! I do wish there was someone
who cared enough for me

494
00:33:44,650 --> 00:33:47,450
to go after him.

495
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:53,250
Oh, a man like that,
strong and brave,

496
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:57,150
I'd do anything for him.

497
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:59,450
Never fear, my queen.

498
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:02,850
I will stop him!

499
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,650
- What now?
- Another one?

500
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:16,650
Whoa! Get him out of there.
Let's go. Get in there.

501
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:18,450
Where are these people coming from?

502
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,050
- Come on!
- Upsy-daisy.

503
00:34:20,050 --> 00:34:22,950
Get him up.

504
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,750
- Hey, pal.
- Yow!

505
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,250
Let me guess. You're, uh,
looking for a beautiful girl too.

506
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,050
No.

507
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:32,450
I'm looking for a prince, actually.

508
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,150
Right.

509
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:43,750
You've met your match,
you foul bellowing beast!

510
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:57,550
- Everybody, stay on the bus.
- Giselle? My love?

511
00:34:57,650 --> 00:35:00,050
Drat!

512
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,650
The steel beast is dead, peasants.
I set you all free.

513
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,650
- Move that bus!
- Come on, already!

514
00:35:06,650 --> 00:35:09,650
- Get that bus out of there!
- Are you crazy?

515
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:13,150
Nobody stabs my bus!
I'll tear you apart!

516
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,850
Do you hear me?

517
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:17,050
- You get down here!
- If you'll allow me...

518
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:20,850
- Nathaniel, old friend!
- Sire, may I suggest that you...

519
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:24,550
You? A friend of his?
Crazy tight-wearing...

520
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:27,450
Come here and mess up my route?
I'll tear you both apart!

521
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,850
Don't you roll your eyes at me!

522
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:34,150
A rat!
Get it away from me!

523
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:36,850
Well, strictly speaking,
he's a chipmunk.

524
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:41,250
Sire, may I suggest we seek elsewhere

525
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:42,950
for your bride?

526
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:04,150
- What are you looking at?
- She's beautiful.

527
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,750
It's just a statue!

528
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,650
Come quickly. Quickly.

529
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:11,450
Sam? Sam, please don't tell me
Mrs. Banks is already here.

530
00:36:11,550 --> 00:36:13,150
- Mrs. Banks is here.
- Great.

531
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:14,750
With Mr. Banks and his lawyer.

532
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,850
- Perfect, how long?
- Do you want to know?

533
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,550
No, I don't. I need you to
handle something for me, OK?

534
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,050
- See this girl?
- Who is she?

535
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,550
No idea. I'm pretty sure
she's from out of town.

536
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,750
- What do I do?
- Find out where she's from,

537
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:28,050
and get her there.
And make sure it's cheap.

538
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,050
If Nancy calls me,
I need to talk to her.

539
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:32,050
Giselle? Don't drink that, OK?

540
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:34,450
I have a meeting.
Sam is gonna get you home.

541
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:36,650
Sam? This is Giselle.
Giselle, this is Sam.

542
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:38,250
- Yes? Hi.
- Stay out of trouble.

543
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,550
Oh... Oh.

544
00:36:44,650 --> 00:36:48,450
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you too.

545
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,150
Your Majesty.

546
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:01,950
- Nathaniel!
- Your Majesty?

547
00:37:03,850 --> 00:37:05,850
Nathaniel, here!

548
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,950
Nathaniel!

549
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,350
Finally. Finally.
I'm boiling in here.

550
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:19,950
- Have you found her yet?
- I'm afraid I haven't, My Lady.

551
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:23,250
Time is of the essence.

552
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:26,250
We can't risk my stepson
bringing the girl back.

553
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:28,350
He shan't, Your Majesty!
I swear it!

554
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:32,750
No, he shan't. I intend to make
absolutely certain of that.

555
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,550
But, Your Majesty,
how exactly did you...?

556
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:41,550
...ever end up tasting so...
Mmm... delicious?

557
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:46,250
Poisoned apples, My Lady.

558
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:49,850
- You want me to...?
- Don't you see, my darling?

559
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:55,050
If there's ever going to be
a happily ever after for us...

560
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:57,450
- Hmm?
- Happily...

561
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,950
...ever after?
Oh, My Lady.

562
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,250
Mmm, yes.
It won't be difficult.

563
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:06,850
It's just one bite.
That's all it takes.

564
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:11,050
One small bite to drag her down

565
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:14,950
into a deep and troubled sleep.

566
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,450
And when the hands
of the clock strike 12,

567
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,950
that precious little pretender
to my throne

568
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:23,150
will be gone!

569
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,650
It shall be done, My Lady.

570
00:38:26,650 --> 00:38:28,650
- I swear it.
- Yes.

571
00:38:28,750 --> 00:38:32,050
You'll find the girl
at Columbus Circle...

572
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,550
Your Majesty?

573
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,050
Hello.

574
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:41,950
You little...

575
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:44,150
Whoa! Hey!

576
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,550
- Pip!
- Sire! Sire, please. I beg of you.

577
00:38:57,650 --> 00:39:01,150
Don't listen to that
insane little vermin.

578
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,150
He's probably eaten some bad nuts.

579
00:39:03,250 --> 00:39:05,250
We should put him down
for his own good.

580
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:07,050
Nathaniel, please.
Let him speak.

581
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:10,250
But, sire! No. He's delirious.
He came to tell all sorts of...

582
00:39:15,250 --> 00:39:17,550
Go ahead, Pip.

583
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:20,250
What is it you want to say?

584
00:39:20,350 --> 00:39:22,950
You watch me. OK?

585
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,950
Nathaniel?

586
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:29,550
Uh-huh. Nathaniel...

587
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:33,350
- Nathaniel's glad to have me near.
- No, no, no.

588
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,350
Hmm... Oh!

589
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:54,950
Oh, oh, oh!
I know this.

590
00:39:55,050 --> 00:39:57,950
- Uh...
- Apple?

591
00:39:58,050 --> 00:39:59,750
No, thank you.

592
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,250
It's good.

593
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:03,750
Oh, OK.

594
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,050
Ta-da!

595
00:40:13,850 --> 00:40:17,350
You feel you'd die without me here.

596
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,550
Yes. Here we go. Good.

597
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,450
Well, I have to say,
I really think that went well.

598
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:27,950
There's no reason not
to be reasonable.

599
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:31,150
Great. We might be in the
neighborhood of a settlement.

600
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:33,750
Excuse me. I'm gonna
check on your cars for a second.

601
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,350
- Sorry.
- What? What?

602
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:37,750
She has no driver's license.
No passport.

603
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,650
Can't find this place she comes from.

604
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:40,850
- What place?
- Andalusia.

605
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:42,150
- Andalasia.
- Whatever.

606
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,250
I've called every travel agent.

607
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,450
I don't know if it's
a country or a city.

608
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:49,650
- It can't be a state.
- More like a state of mind.

609
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:52,650
She told me it's just
beyond the Meadows of Joy

610
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,750
and the Valley of Contentment.
What is that all about?

611
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:02,350
Oh, my goodness.
Your hair is lovely.

612
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,950
- You're beautiful.
- Well, thank you.

613
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:07,850
The man who holds your heart
is a lucky fellow indeed.

614
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:10,750
- You try telling him that.
- I'm certain he already knows.

615
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:14,450
- Excuse me?
- Are you him?

616
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:18,650
You are very lucky. Just look
at the way her eyes sparkle.

617
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:21,650
- It's no wonder you're in love.
- I got it!

618
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:24,950
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Giselle? Please?

619
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:28,050
It's not like that, all right?
They're not together anymore.

620
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,550
- I don't understand.
- They're getting a divorce.

621
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,450
- Separating from each other.
- Separating?

622
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:35,150
- Yeah.
- For how long?

623
00:41:35,250 --> 00:41:38,350
- Forever.
- Forever and ever?

624
00:41:38,450 --> 00:41:41,250
Shh. Yes.

625
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:43,950
- Oh, no.
- What are you doing?

626
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:46,150
- Don't cry.
- Are you crying?

627
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,150
- She's not.
- I'm sorry. I can't help it.

628
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,950
- Is she actually crying?
- It's just so sad.

629
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,450
What kind of an operation
are you running here?

630
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,150
This is so unprofessional.

631
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,750
Good morning, Phoebe.
How are you? It's good to...

632
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:00,250
If you guys
are trying to manipulate us,

633
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:03,050
you can throw this whole deal out.

634
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,150
What is going on here?
Who's she?

635
00:42:07,250 --> 00:42:09,750
Uh, a friend. No, she's
an acquaintance, actually.

636
00:42:09,850 --> 00:42:13,050
You begged me to put you on the case,
and this is what I get for it?

637
00:42:13,050 --> 00:42:15,250
I walk in here
and find everybody upset?

638
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:17,550
<i>And some girl is crying
like we're on Oprah.</i>

639
00:42:17,650 --> 00:42:20,850
I'll take care of it.
Carl, it's gonna be fine.

640
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,350
- What is wrong with you?
- Me?

641
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:26,050
<i>Yes, you. This whole Kumbaya,
Up With People routine.</i>

642
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:29,050
- Those people are in real pain.
- Of course they're in pain.

643
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,450
They're separated forever.

644
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,650
Married one day
and the next they're not.

645
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:35,250
- What sort of awful place is this?
- It's reality.

646
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,550
Well, I think I'd prefer to be
in Andalasia.

647
00:42:37,650 --> 00:42:40,450
- I think I'd prefer that too.
- Get in, please.

648
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:47,450
I wonder if we might cover
more ground separately, sire.

649
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:51,450
Uh, you by yourself,
and me with it.

650
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:54,250
An inspired plan, Nathaniel.

651
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:56,550
Where do you suppose I should look?

652
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:09,950
Look, sire! Over there!

653
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:11,450
Ah! Giselle!

654
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:15,450
Run to her, sire! Hurry!
Not a moment to lose!

655
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:18,750
- Giselle!
- I try to do the right thing.

656
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:20,350
Oh, you've been very nice to me.

657
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:24,450
Severely punished for it.
OK, look, Giselle?

658
00:43:24,550 --> 00:43:26,650
- I can't help you anymore. OK?
- What?

659
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:30,350
Here's some money. I want you
to take it. Call your prince.

660
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,350
Have him pick you up,
bring his horse.

661
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:35,250
Because I honestly,
I just can't handle it.

662
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,650
- Robert?
- Just go.

663
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:41,050
I'm so sorry.

664
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:43,950
You have been a very kind friend
to me when I had none.

665
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:48,450
And I would never want to make you
unhappy or cause you any trouble, so...

666
00:43:50,150 --> 00:43:51,950
...I'll go.

667
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:56,550
I wish you every happiness.

668
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:21,150
You have lovely friends.

669
00:44:21,250 --> 00:44:24,450
Would you like to feed
the birds? Just a dollar a bag.

670
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:26,550
Certainly.

671
00:44:26,550 --> 00:44:28,350
By chance,
have you seen my prince?

672
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,450
He was here.

673
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:33,250
- Do you really think so?
- Oh, yes.

674
00:44:33,350 --> 00:44:35,850
- Oh!
- Giselle? What are you doing?

675
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:38,950
- Robert! This is Clara.
- Mm-hmm.

676
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:40,550
- She saw Edward.
- Oh.

677
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:42,950
He was on the bus this morning.

678
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:46,750
- He tried to kill me!
- Great. Wonderful. Thank you.

679
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,150
- Oh!
- What are you thinking?

680
00:44:48,250 --> 00:44:50,850
- You can't just give people money.
- You gave me money.

681
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:54,250
- That's not the point.
- And she was very helpful.

682
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:56,350
So, what's the deal,
this prince of yours?

683
00:44:56,350 --> 00:45:00,350
- How long you two been together?
- Oh, about a day.

684
00:45:00,350 --> 00:45:02,950
You mean it feels like a day
because you're so in love?

685
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:06,850
- No. It's been a day.
- You're kidding me. A day?

686
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:08,550
- One day?
- Yes.

687
00:45:08,650 --> 00:45:12,050
- And tomorrow will be two days.
- You're joking.

688
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:13,950
- No. I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

689
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,550
But I'm not.

690
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:19,250
You're gonna marry somebody after a day
because you fell in love with him?

691
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,850
Yes.

692
00:45:21,850 --> 00:45:23,450
Yes!

693
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,050
Oh! Ooh!

694
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,050
I don't get it. How can you talk
about loving some guy

695
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:38,250
- you don't even know?
- Well, I know what's in his heart.

696
00:45:38,350 --> 00:45:40,750
Oh, OK. Great.

697
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:42,950
This was so yummy.

698
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,250
I didn't know that food
could taste like this.

699
00:45:45,350 --> 00:45:47,650
- You all done? OK.
- Mmm!

700
00:45:47,650 --> 00:45:50,650
- Let me put that out for you.
- What about you?

701
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:55,050
- How long have you known your Nancy?
- Uh, it's five years.

702
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:57,850
- And you haven't proposed?
- Well, no. I...

703
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,450
Well, no wonder she's angry.

704
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:01,750
Hello, nice lady.

705
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:05,750
You want juicy,
sweet caramel apple, maybe?

706
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:06,950
Mm.

707
00:46:06,950 --> 00:46:09,650
No charge for the beautiful
young woman.

708
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,550
- Oh, really. It's free?
- Of course!

709
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,350
Today is free caramel apple day.

710
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:18,750
Tomorrow is free beef... jerky.

711
00:46:18,850 --> 00:46:21,250
Thank you very much, kind sir.

712
00:46:21,350 --> 00:46:25,550
You're welcome, miss.

713
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:27,350
You...

714
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,550
Shut up.

715
00:46:33,650 --> 00:46:36,850
Most normal people get to know
each other before they get married.

716
00:46:36,950 --> 00:46:39,150
They date.

717
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,350
- Date?
- Yeah. You know, date.

718
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:44,550
You go someplace special.
You know, like a restaurant,

719
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:48,650
or a movie, a museum. Or you
just hang out and you talk.

720
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:51,950
- What do you talk about?
- About each other.

721
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:54,450
About yourself.
About your interests.

722
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,750
Your likes, your dislikes.
You talk!

723
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:59,550
You have such strange
ideas about love.

724
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:03,250
Maybe we should do what you would do.
You meet, have lunch, and get married.

725
00:47:03,350 --> 00:47:05,350
Oh! You forgot
about happily ever after.

726
00:47:05,450 --> 00:47:07,750
Forget "happily ever after."
It doesn't exist.

727
00:47:07,850 --> 00:47:10,150
Well, of course it does.
Oh!

728
00:47:10,150 --> 00:47:12,150
Oh!

729
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:15,250
I hate to disagree,
but marriages are a success

730
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:16,650
if they manage not to end.

731
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,450
- Forget about happiness.
- What about you and Nancy?

732
00:47:19,550 --> 00:47:21,850
You know that you will
live happily ever after.

733
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,350
I don't know if I'll make it
through today, let alone a lifetime.

734
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:29,050
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
It's complicated.

735
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,250
But it doesn't have to be.

736
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,950
- Not if she knows.
- Knows what?

737
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,550
- How much you really love her.
- Of course she does.

738
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:39,750
We just don't talk about it every minute
of the day, but she knows.

739
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,550
- How?
- What do you mean, "how?"

740
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,250
<i>How does she know</i>

741
00:47:45,350 --> 00:47:48,350
<i>- You love her?
- No. Don't.</i>

742
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:51,950
<i>- How does she know
- People looking.</i>

743
00:47:52,050 --> 00:47:56,050
<i>- She's yours?
- Don't sing. It's OK.</i>

744
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:58,450
Let's just walk.
Can we walk? OK?

745
00:47:58,450 --> 00:47:59,950
- Well, does she?
- Yeah.

746
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,350
<i>How does she know
that you love her?</i>

747
00:48:02,450 --> 00:48:04,050
- Oh.
- He knows the song too?

748
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:06,550
<i>How do you
show her you love her?</i>

749
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:10,750
<i>How does she know
that you really</i>

750
00:48:10,850 --> 00:48:13,950
<i>- Really, truly love her?
- I've never heard this song.</i>

751
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,350
<i>How does she know
that you love her?</i>

752
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:19,350
<i>- How do you show her you love her?
- Really nice work.</i>

753
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,350
<i>- How does she know that you really
- That's it. OK.</i>

754
00:48:22,450 --> 00:48:24,550
<i>- Truly love her?
- Let's go.</i>

755
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:29,550
<i>It's not enough to take
the one you love for granted</i>

756
00:48:29,650 --> 00:48:34,450
<i>You must remind her
or she'll be inclined to say</i>

757
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:37,550
<i>How do I know</i>

758
00:48:37,650 --> 00:48:39,950
<i>He loves me?</i>

759
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:42,850
<i>How do I know</i>

760
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:45,450
<i>He's mine?</i>

761
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:48,650
<i>Well, does he leave
a little note to tell you</i>

762
00:48:48,750 --> 00:48:51,750
<i>You are on his mind?</i>

763
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:55,550
<i>Send you yellow flowers
when the sky is gray?</i>

764
00:48:55,650 --> 00:49:00,150
<i>Hey, he'll find
a new way to show you</i>

765
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:03,050
<i>A little bit every day</i>

766
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,650
<i>That's how you know</i>

767
00:49:05,750 --> 00:49:10,150
<i>That's how you know
he's your love</i>

768
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:12,850
- See?
- I've seen quite enough. Let's go.

769
00:49:12,950 --> 00:49:14,550
- A ball?
- Yeah.

770
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:17,850
- That would be fun!
- That would not be fun.

771
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:22,750
<i>You got to show her
you need her</i>

772
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,450
<i>Don't treat her
like a mind reader</i>

773
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:27,850
<i>Each day do something
to lead her</i>

774
00:49:27,950 --> 00:49:30,750
<i>To believe you love her</i>

775
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:35,550
<i>Everybody wants to live
happily ever after</i>

776
00:49:35,650 --> 00:49:40,550
<i>Everybody wants to know
their true love is true</i>

777
00:49:40,550 --> 00:49:46,250
<i>How do you
know he loves you?</i>

778
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:51,550
<i>How do you know he's yours?</i>

779
00:49:51,550 --> 00:49:56,950
<i>Well, does he take you out dancing
just so he can hold you close?</i>

780
00:49:57,050 --> 00:49:58,250
I don't dance.

781
00:49:58,350 --> 00:50:02,750
<i>Dedicate a song with words
meant just for you? Ooh</i>

782
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:06,650
<i>- And I really don't sing.
- He'll find his own way to tell you</i>

783
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,350
<i>With the little things he'll do</i>

784
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:11,650
<i>That's how you know</i>

785
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:17,050
<i>That's how you know
he's your love</i>

786
00:50:19,550 --> 00:50:23,950
<i>He's your love</i>

787
00:50:23,950 --> 00:50:26,150
Giselle!

788
00:50:29,650 --> 00:50:34,650
<i>I've been dreaming...</i>

789
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:43,550
Take these flowers to Nancy, please?

790
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:46,650
Are you crazy? They're birds.
They don't know where she lives.

791
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:52,350
<i>That's how you know</i>

792
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:54,850
<i>He loves you</i>

793
00:50:54,950 --> 00:50:57,750
<i>That's how you know</i>

794
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,950
<i>It's true</i>

795
00:50:59,950 --> 00:51:02,750
<i>Because he'll wear
your favorite color</i>

796
00:51:02,750 --> 00:51:06,450
<i>Just so he can match your eyes</i>

797
00:51:06,550 --> 00:51:08,350
<i>Plan a private picnic</i>

798
00:51:08,450 --> 00:51:12,550
<i>By the fire's glow, oh</i>

799
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:15,150
<i>His heart'll be yours forever</i>

800
00:51:15,250 --> 00:51:18,050
<i>Something every day
will show</i>

801
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:20,750
<i>That's how you know</i>

802
00:51:20,750 --> 00:51:23,250
<i>That's how you know</i>

803
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:26,250
<i>That's how you know</i>

804
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:29,050
<i>That's how you know</i>

805
00:51:29,150 --> 00:51:31,550
<i>That's how you know</i>

806
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,750
<i>That's how you know</i>

807
00:51:33,850 --> 00:51:35,150
<i>He's your love</i>

808
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:37,450
<i>That's how she knows
that you love her</i>

809
00:51:37,550 --> 00:51:39,850
<i>That's how you show her
you love her</i>

810
00:51:39,950 --> 00:51:44,350
<i>- That's how you know
- You've got to show her you need her</i>

811
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:49,650
<i>That's how you know</i>

812
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:55,750
<i>He's your love</i>

813
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:00,050
Thank you.

814
00:52:03,969 --> 00:52:07,097
Thank you.

815
00:52:07,172 --> 00:52:10,039
So much. Thank you.

816
00:52:10,108 --> 00:52:12,872
<i>- Nancy?
- Thank you so much for the flowers.</i>

817
00:52:12,944 --> 00:52:15,504
Well, you're welcome.
No, I'm glad you liked them.

818
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:17,810
<i>- She got the flowers.
- Catch you at a bad time?</i>

819
00:52:17,883 --> 00:52:20,283
Yeah. You wouldn't believe
where I am right now.

820
00:52:20,352 --> 00:52:24,049
Sire! Oh dear, oh dear.

821
00:52:24,122 --> 00:52:27,888
- You've fallen on your royal...
- I know.

822
00:52:29,027 --> 00:52:30,324
Ah!

823
00:52:42,307 --> 00:52:44,138
- I love them so much.
- Really?

824
00:52:44,209 --> 00:52:47,235
Usually you send those e-mail cards
with the digital flowers.

825
00:52:47,312 --> 00:52:50,577
These are exquisite. Where do you find
live doves in New York City?

826
00:52:50,649 --> 00:52:53,516
- Oh, it's a long story.
- And these? Oh!

827
00:52:53,585 --> 00:52:55,712
- We're going to a ball?
- You don't have to.

828
00:52:55,787 --> 00:52:57,948
Are you kidding me?
It's so romantic.

829
00:52:58,023 --> 00:53:00,184
- So spontaneous!
- Good.

830
00:53:00,258 --> 00:53:03,421
- I can't wait.
- Good. Great.

831
00:53:03,495 --> 00:53:05,019
And...

832
00:53:05,097 --> 00:53:08,362
...as far as Giselle's concerned,
I'm just trying to help her.

833
00:53:08,433 --> 00:53:09,957
- Nothing's...
- You know what?

834
00:53:10,035 --> 00:53:14,699
If you say nothing happened,
nothing happened. I trust you.

835
00:53:14,773 --> 00:53:19,506
- So tomorrow night, then.
- This is so unlike you.

836
00:53:57,449 --> 00:54:01,317
<i>... middle of Times Square with that bus
driver who was ambushed earlier today</i>

837
00:54:01,386 --> 00:54:05,413
It appears this odd little box
controls the magic mirror.

838
00:54:05,490 --> 00:54:09,051
<i>They were dressed
all freaky. Then this chipmunk...</i>

839
00:54:09,127 --> 00:54:11,857
<i>I've always been in love with you.</i>

840
00:54:13,331 --> 00:54:16,767
<i>Don't you have any self-respect?</i>

841
00:54:18,804 --> 00:54:20,863
<i>I don't need self-respect.</i>

842
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:23,903
<i>I just need your lips against mine.</i>

843
00:54:25,644 --> 00:54:29,603
Wait, sire!
Go back! Go back! Please!

844
00:54:29,681 --> 00:54:33,481
<i>How could I love a man
who doesn't even like himself?</i>

845
00:54:39,624 --> 00:54:43,082
<i>Get away from me, Jerry!
You disgust me!</i>

846
00:54:43,161 --> 00:54:46,187
<i>I can't help my
feelings for you, Angela.</i>

847
00:54:46,264 --> 00:54:48,994
<i>It's love that makes me
act this crazy.</i>

848
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:52,559
<i>This isn't love.
This is infatuation.</i>

849
00:54:54,339 --> 00:54:56,933
Shh, shh, shh.

850
00:54:57,008 --> 00:54:58,498
Oh. Shh.

851
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,704
Nathaniel likes the way I leap?

852
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,688
I'm handsome even when I sleep?

853
00:55:16,428 --> 00:55:18,453
Sad little chipmunk.

854
00:55:18,530 --> 00:55:21,931
Aw, deranged from exhaustion.

855
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,130
Aw. Maybe you'd like to snuggle
in a nice little nook

856
00:55:26,204 --> 00:55:27,967
for the night, eh?

857
00:55:42,954 --> 00:55:45,149
Night-night.

858
00:55:47,626 --> 00:55:50,424
Sleep tight.

859
00:55:50,495 --> 00:55:53,089
I think I need some air, sire.

860
00:55:56,468 --> 00:55:59,596
<i>I don't like them sad endings.</i>

861
00:56:03,008 --> 00:56:04,600
Sire.

862
00:56:05,343 --> 00:56:07,743
Do you...

863
00:56:07,812 --> 00:56:09,177
...like yourself?

864
00:56:10,782 --> 00:56:12,773
What's not to like?

865
00:57:04,636 --> 00:57:06,103
Where'd he go?

866
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,467
<i>When the moon hits your eye</i>

867
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:13,272
<i>Like a big pizza pie...</i>

868
00:57:13,345 --> 00:57:15,836
Oh, yeah. Here.
Watch this.

869
00:57:15,914 --> 00:57:19,680
Watch very carefully. I'm gonna
put it in this hand like that.

870
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:22,481
Oh, do it again! Show me!
That's wonderful.

871
00:57:22,554 --> 00:57:24,647
- Show me again!
- All right. Last time.

872
00:57:24,723 --> 00:57:26,122
There you go. There it is.

873
00:57:26,191 --> 00:57:27,920
And look.

874
00:57:29,427 --> 00:57:31,918
You're a wizard!

875
00:57:35,533 --> 00:57:37,023
What?

876
00:57:38,403 --> 00:57:40,598
- This is a very nice place.
- Yeah.

877
00:57:40,672 --> 00:57:43,505
- And we're eating dinner?
- Yeah.

878
00:57:43,575 --> 00:57:46,135
- This is a date.
- Yeah.

879
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:49,772
No! No! No, no. We're just...

880
00:57:49,848 --> 00:57:51,839
We're just friends.

881
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:55,852
Besides, people don't usually
bring their children on dates.

882
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:58,288
That's too bad.

883
00:57:58,356 --> 00:58:01,985
Morgan's a lovely girl.
She's very kind and very sweet.

884
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:04,028
Yeah. She's great.

885
00:58:06,598 --> 00:58:10,830
- What?
- Does she miss her terribly?

886
00:58:10,902 --> 00:58:12,699
- Miss who?
- Her mother.

887
00:58:12,771 --> 00:58:14,136
Um...

888
00:58:15,373 --> 00:58:17,398
- Well, we just...
- What?

889
00:58:19,878 --> 00:58:21,903
- We don't talk about it.
- Oh.

890
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:24,141
I'm very sorry.
I didn't mean to pry.

891
00:58:24,215 --> 00:58:26,376
No, no. It's OK.
It's just...

892
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:32,579
I don't talk about it...
to Morgan or to anybody.

893
00:58:32,657 --> 00:58:36,058
- Because it was very sad?
- Not at first.

894
00:58:36,127 --> 00:58:39,858
- You were in love.
- Yeah.

895
00:58:39,931 --> 00:58:42,161
Yeah.

896
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:45,225
- That was the problem.
- How could that be a problem?

897
00:58:45,303 --> 00:58:48,966
Because love... The lovey-dovey
version that you talk about?

898
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,133
It's fantasy.

899
00:58:51,209 --> 00:58:53,643
And one day,
you have to wake up and...

900
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,675
...you're in the real world.
- What made you wake up?

901
00:59:00,452 --> 00:59:02,147
Well...

902
00:59:05,557 --> 00:59:07,115
...she left.

903
00:59:09,561 --> 00:59:13,122
- I'm so sorry for you both.
- It's OK.

904
00:59:13,198 --> 00:59:15,894
I'm a big boy.
I can handle it.

905
00:59:15,967 --> 00:59:17,696
It's her I worry about, though.

906
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:21,603
I know she's shy. I know she
doesn't have very many friends.

907
00:59:21,673 --> 00:59:23,698
I just want her to be strong,
you know?

908
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:26,608
To be able to face
the world for what it is.

909
00:59:26,678 --> 00:59:28,908
That's why I don't
encourage the fairy tales.

910
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,073
I don't want to set her up

911
00:59:31,149 --> 00:59:33,913
to believe in this
"dreams come true" nonsense.

912
00:59:33,985 --> 00:59:36,317
But dreams do come true.

913
00:59:36,387 --> 00:59:39,083
And maybe something
wonderful will happen.

914
00:59:39,157 --> 00:59:42,558
Yeah, well, I forgot
who I was talking to.

915
00:59:42,627 --> 00:59:45,357
Well, I hope you don't forget.

916
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:46,556
I like talking to you.

917
00:59:46,631 --> 00:59:49,293
For the nice lady.

918
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:51,426
From a secret admirer.

919
00:59:51,503 --> 00:59:53,835
How come people keep
giving you free stuff?

920
00:59:53,905 --> 00:59:58,501
- What is it?
- It's an apple martini, miss.

921
00:59:58,576 --> 01:00:01,010
Apple mar... Ooh!
It looks yummy.

922
01:00:01,079 --> 01:00:03,274
Be careful. It's poisonous.

923
01:00:04,782 --> 01:00:07,080
- You're joking.
- Yeah.

924
01:00:08,419 --> 01:00:10,683
They'll creep up on you.
I'd be careful.

925
01:00:10,755 --> 01:00:15,624
- Well, I'll just have one sip.
- A sip is all it takes.

926
01:00:15,693 --> 01:00:16,990
Oh.

927
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:21,828
- Hi-yah!
- Oh!

928
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:23,527
You miserable...

929
01:00:23,601 --> 01:00:26,365
There's a rodent on the table!
Can we get some help here?

930
01:00:26,437 --> 01:00:28,371
He's telling me something!

931
01:00:28,439 --> 01:00:31,806
Pip, you're here! Oh!

932
01:00:33,178 --> 01:00:35,703
- It's chewing off her face!
- A chipmunk!

933
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:37,714
That thing's loaded with disease.

934
01:00:37,782 --> 01:00:39,511
Edward is here!

935
01:00:39,584 --> 01:00:43,281
- Edward is here!
- I'll save you, miss!

936
01:00:43,354 --> 01:00:45,083
Oh, my! Pip?

937
01:00:45,156 --> 01:00:47,716
- Okey-dokey.
- Duck!

938
01:00:51,796 --> 01:00:53,229
Let me see your face.

939
01:00:53,298 --> 01:00:57,257
I'm fine!
Pip wouldn't scratch me! No!

940
01:00:57,335 --> 01:01:01,533
- Where's Pip? Where is he?
- The pizza's breathing!

941
01:01:04,409 --> 01:01:06,274
Oh! Pip!

942
01:01:18,489 --> 01:01:19,717
Oh, no.

943
01:01:21,793 --> 01:01:22,953
Pip.

944
01:01:23,027 --> 01:01:24,927
What's wrong? Are you OK?

945
01:01:25,797 --> 01:01:27,560
Oh, Daddy.

946
01:01:34,839 --> 01:01:38,434
Tell me magic mirror,
what is this awful place?

947
01:01:38,509 --> 01:01:41,307
Why is everything so difficult?

948
01:01:41,379 --> 01:01:43,711
Will I ever find my heart's duet?

949
01:01:43,781 --> 01:01:47,376
<i>Preliminary search of the pizza oven
did not reveal any rodent remains.</i>

950
01:01:47,452 --> 01:01:49,010
<i>This animal's still out there.</i>

951
01:01:49,087 --> 01:01:51,647
<i>Joining us is the woman
who was attacked</i>

952
01:01:51,723 --> 01:01:53,247
<i>- by this chipmunk.
- Giselle!</i>

953
01:01:53,324 --> 01:01:55,053
<i>Tell us, how does it feel</i>

954
01:01:55,126 --> 01:01:58,391
<i>knowing this dangerous animal
is most likely still alive?</i>

955
01:01:58,463 --> 01:02:02,229
<i>Wonderful! Pip is my very
best friend, and...</i>

956
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:03,767
<i>Giselle, why don't we go home?</i>

957
01:02:03,835 --> 01:02:06,099
<i>I wasn't finished.
One more question, please.</i>

958
01:02:06,170 --> 01:02:07,865
What villainy is this?

959
01:02:07,939 --> 01:02:10,931
<i>Is this unprovoked attack
part of some new trend?</i>

960
01:02:11,009 --> 01:02:14,604
<i>- Is rodent rage on the rise?
- Magic mirror, I beg you.</i>

961
01:02:14,679 --> 01:02:17,204
<i>- Tell me where she is!
- From 116th and Broadway...</i>

962
01:02:17,282 --> 01:02:21,810
116th and Broadway!
Thank you, mirror.

963
01:02:21,886 --> 01:02:23,945
<i>... I'm Mary Ilene Caselotti.</i>

964
01:02:24,022 --> 01:02:27,753
My goodness. We sure
had a lot of excitement tonight.

965
01:02:27,825 --> 01:02:30,623
- Were you scared earlier?
- A little bit.

966
01:02:30,695 --> 01:02:33,186
But do you
think Pip will be OK?

967
01:02:33,264 --> 01:02:35,528
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about Pip.

968
01:02:35,600 --> 01:02:37,591
He is very brave.

969
01:02:37,669 --> 01:02:41,435
I remember this one time
when the poor wolf

970
01:02:41,506 --> 01:02:43,531
was being chased by
Little Red Riding Hood

971
01:02:43,608 --> 01:02:47,704
around his grandmother's house
and she had an axe. Oh.

972
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:49,770
And if Pip hadn't
been walking by to help,

973
01:02:49,847 --> 01:02:52,543
I don't know
what would've happened.

974
01:02:52,617 --> 01:02:55,552
I don't really
remember that version.

975
01:02:55,620 --> 01:02:58,521
Well, that's because Red
tells it a little differently.

976
01:02:59,557 --> 01:03:00,615
Good night, Giselle.

977
01:03:00,692 --> 01:03:02,683
And thank you for the nice story.

978
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,523
Good night, Morgan.

979
01:03:34,525 --> 01:03:37,119
Ma'am! You cannot
let your dog do that here!

980
01:04:06,724 --> 01:04:08,658
You're too late.

981
01:04:10,027 --> 01:04:11,585
My apologies.

982
01:04:38,856 --> 01:04:41,324
Oh, Giselle!

983
01:04:50,101 --> 01:04:52,535
Look, uh, Giselle.

984
01:04:52,603 --> 01:04:56,061
That was a nice story about
your chipmunk friend and all.

985
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:58,267
Yes.

986
01:04:58,342 --> 01:05:01,311
I know what it's like
when someone disappoints you.

987
01:05:01,379 --> 01:05:03,574
It's tempting to see things
the way you wish

988
01:05:03,648 --> 01:05:06,811
- instead of how they are.
- I don't wish that he's coming, Robert.

989
01:05:06,884 --> 01:05:07,873
He is.

990
01:05:07,952 --> 01:05:10,443
Right.
Because the chipmunk told you.

991
01:05:10,521 --> 01:05:12,648
Yes. Pip actually said...

992
01:05:12,723 --> 01:05:14,816
Know what? I don't
know if you're kidding

993
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:18,259
or being ironic,
because chipmunks don't talk.

994
01:05:18,329 --> 01:05:19,921
Well, not here they don't.

995
01:05:19,997 --> 01:05:22,557
So in lieu of taking advice
from a forest rodent,

996
01:05:22,633 --> 01:05:24,828
I just wanted to say that, uh...

997
01:05:24,902 --> 01:05:28,269
...if it did work out and you
decided to stay in New York,

998
01:05:28,339 --> 01:05:31,866
- I'd like to help.
- That's very kind of you, Robert.

999
01:05:31,943 --> 01:05:34,673
- But Edward is coming for me.
- But what if he doesn't?

1000
01:05:34,745 --> 01:05:36,474
Why do you keep saying that?

1001
01:05:36,547 --> 01:05:38,811
Because I deal with this every day.

1002
01:05:38,883 --> 01:05:41,477
If a relationship
has issues at the beginning,

1003
01:05:41,552 --> 01:05:44,578
- it doesn't get any better.
- He is coming!

1004
01:05:44,655 --> 01:05:47,783
Giselle, I don't think so. No.

1005
01:05:47,859 --> 01:05:51,022
- Yes!
- I have to disagree. No.

1006
01:05:51,095 --> 01:05:52,687
- No?
- No.

1007
01:05:52,763 --> 01:05:56,096
Is that the only word that you know? No?

1008
01:05:56,167 --> 01:05:58,727
- No!
- Oh, yeah? No.

1009
01:05:58,803 --> 01:06:03,706
- No. I mean, no.
- No! No! Over and over again!

1010
01:06:03,774 --> 01:06:07,403
Every word out of your mouth
is "no"! It makes me so...

1011
01:06:07,478 --> 01:06:10,106
- Sometimes you make me so...
- I make you so what?

1012
01:06:10,181 --> 01:06:11,978
You make me so...

1013
01:06:12,049 --> 01:06:13,573
So...

1014
01:06:15,186 --> 01:06:18,519
...angry!

1015
01:06:18,589 --> 01:06:21,752
- I'm angry!
- Are you all right?

1016
01:06:21,826 --> 01:06:26,593
- I'm angry. I'm angry!
- Are you OK?

1017
01:06:26,664 --> 01:06:27,961
I'm...

1018
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,525
I'm wonderful.

1019
01:06:34,705 --> 01:06:36,468
Are you sure?

1020
01:06:37,642 --> 01:06:39,576
Yes. I'm...

1021
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,076
I'm fine.

1022
01:06:46,784 --> 01:06:48,581
I'm...

1023
01:06:48,653 --> 01:06:50,450
...fit as a fiddle.

1024
01:06:56,661 --> 01:06:58,424
OK.

1025
01:07:02,900 --> 01:07:04,333
Good night.

1026
01:07:16,948 --> 01:07:18,677
Oh, my.

1027
01:08:02,994 --> 01:08:05,053
- Good morning.
- Morning, Daddy.

1028
01:08:05,129 --> 01:08:06,960
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1029
01:08:07,031 --> 01:08:10,967
Morning. Made breakfast.
Great.

1030
01:08:11,035 --> 01:08:12,662
I'll get it.

1031
01:08:12,737 --> 01:08:14,034
Thank you.

1032
01:08:15,473 --> 01:08:18,738
- That's a nice dress.
- Thank you.

1033
01:08:18,809 --> 01:08:21,073
It is I! Prince Edward of Andalasia,

1034
01:08:21,145 --> 01:08:23,773
come to rescue my lovely bride,
the fair Giselle!

1035
01:08:23,848 --> 01:08:25,782
- He's here.
- Apparently.

1036
01:08:25,850 --> 01:08:28,410
Oh, my. Oh, my goodness.

1037
01:08:28,486 --> 01:08:33,014
- Oh, um, how do I look?
- Slightly stunned.

1038
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:37,424
- No. I mean, how do I look?
- You look...

1039
01:08:38,396 --> 01:08:39,624
...beautiful.

1040
01:08:41,666 --> 01:08:45,693
- Giselle!
- Edward!

1041
01:08:45,770 --> 01:08:49,638
Ah!

1042
01:08:51,409 --> 01:08:53,877
Could you...? I'm sorry.
But could you just be...?

1043
01:08:53,944 --> 01:08:56,469
- Could you just be careful?
- You!

1044
01:08:56,547 --> 01:08:58,742
- What?
- You're the one who's been

1045
01:08:58,816 --> 01:09:01,444
- holding my Giselle captive!
- Let's stay calm.

1046
01:09:01,519 --> 01:09:02,713
No!

1047
01:09:02,787 --> 01:09:07,019
- Any last words before I dispatch you?
- You have got to be kidding me.

1048
01:09:07,091 --> 01:09:08,615
Strange words.

1049
01:09:08,693 --> 01:09:12,493
No! No! No.

1050
01:09:12,563 --> 01:09:14,793
- These are my friends.
- Oh.

1051
01:09:14,865 --> 01:09:17,356
This is Morgan.
And Robert.

1052
01:09:17,435 --> 01:09:18,834
This is Edward.

1053
01:09:18,903 --> 01:09:22,566
<i>I've been dreaming
of a true love's kiss</i>

1054
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:23,902
He sings too.

1055
01:09:23,974 --> 01:09:28,104
<i>And a miss
I have begun to miss</i>

1056
01:09:28,179 --> 01:09:31,842
<i>Pure and sweet
waiting to complete</i>

1057
01:09:31,916 --> 01:09:35,784
<i>My love song</i>

1058
01:09:35,853 --> 01:09:40,085
<i>Yes, somewhere there's
a maid I've never met</i>

1059
01:09:40,157 --> 01:09:42,591
<i>Who was made</i>

1060
01:09:44,328 --> 01:09:45,955
<i>Who was made</i>

1061
01:09:48,733 --> 01:09:50,325
<i>To finish</i>

1062
01:09:50,401 --> 01:09:54,235
- What's wrong?
- You're not singing.

1063
01:09:54,305 --> 01:09:57,968
Oh. I'm not.

1064
01:09:59,343 --> 01:10:01,140
Well, I'm sorry.

1065
01:10:01,212 --> 01:10:03,703
- I was thinking.
- Thinking?

1066
01:10:03,781 --> 01:10:06,750
Before we leave, there's one
thing I would love to do.

1067
01:10:06,817 --> 01:10:09,411
Name it, my love,
and it is done.

1068
01:10:09,487 --> 01:10:13,321
- I want to go on a date.
- A date!

1069
01:10:15,126 --> 01:10:16,320
What's a date?

1070
01:10:17,595 --> 01:10:18,994
Well...

1071
01:10:20,364 --> 01:10:22,730
...we go out to dinner.

1072
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,995
And we talk about ourselves.

1073
01:10:25,069 --> 01:10:29,597
Our likes and our dislikes.
Our interests.

1074
01:10:29,673 --> 01:10:31,538
A date.

1075
01:10:35,846 --> 01:10:39,282
And remember that you guys can come
and visit Andalasia anytime.

1076
01:10:39,350 --> 01:10:41,409
Sure. And if you ever come to town,

1077
01:10:41,485 --> 01:10:44,079
we should all get together for dinner.

1078
01:10:44,155 --> 01:10:45,884
That would be lovely.

1079
01:10:49,226 --> 01:10:51,353
We'll see each other soon.

1080
01:10:51,428 --> 01:10:54,329
It's not like we're talking
about, you know,

1081
01:10:54,398 --> 01:10:57,526
- forever.
- And ever.

1082
01:10:58,536 --> 01:11:00,436
So, uh...

1083
01:11:03,474 --> 01:11:05,032
...good luck on your date.

1084
01:11:06,744 --> 01:11:10,271
Oh, and you with Nancy.

1085
01:11:13,617 --> 01:11:18,384
And you. It was so nice
spending time with you.

1086
01:11:21,492 --> 01:11:24,552
I'll never forget you.
You know that.

1087
01:11:26,897 --> 01:11:28,057
Yeah?

1088
01:11:30,501 --> 01:11:33,834
Thank you for taking care
of my bride, peasants.

1089
01:11:41,178 --> 01:11:43,703
I'm going to really miss her.

1090
01:11:45,082 --> 01:11:46,276
Me, too, sweetheart.

1091
01:11:50,387 --> 01:11:51,752
Me too.

1092
01:12:02,166 --> 01:12:06,102
I don't know how they found
each other, Your Majesty.

1093
01:12:06,170 --> 01:12:08,195
- I really don't.
- You idiot!

1094
01:12:08,272 --> 01:12:12,402
- But, Your Majesty...
- I sent you to kill her, not save her.

1095
01:12:12,476 --> 01:12:16,970
- Can't you get that straight?
- I realize you're upset, madam.

1096
01:12:17,047 --> 01:12:19,709
But if you could find a way
to give me one more chance.

1097
01:12:19,783 --> 01:12:22,616
Another chance? Do you think
poison apples grow on trees?

1098
01:12:22,686 --> 01:12:26,588
There's only one left!
You are out of chances!

1099
01:12:26,657 --> 01:12:28,852
- But, Your Majesty, please!
- No, forget it!

1100
01:12:28,926 --> 01:12:34,091
I'm coming there! And I will
kill the little wretch myself!

1101
01:12:34,164 --> 01:12:36,223
Oh, pooh.

1102
01:12:46,644 --> 01:12:46,744
I was just thinking about what that girl
said about Phoebe's eyes sparkling.

1103
01:12:46,744 --> 01:12:52,239
I was just thinking about what that girl
said about Phoebe's eyes sparkling.

1104
01:12:52,316 --> 01:12:56,116
I mean, it's the first thing
I noticed when we met.

1105
01:12:56,186 --> 01:12:57,949
- It's true.
- Mm.

1106
01:12:58,022 --> 01:13:02,459
- Her eyes really do sparkle.
- Ethan.

1107
01:13:02,526 --> 01:13:04,153
OK, look. Look.

1108
01:13:04,228 --> 01:13:06,958
As your attorney, Phoebe,

1109
01:13:07,031 --> 01:13:10,000
you can't let a chance encounter
with someone...

1110
01:13:10,067 --> 01:13:11,295
What if it wasn't chance?

1111
01:13:11,368 --> 01:13:13,859
What if it was no accident,
us meeting her.

1112
01:13:13,938 --> 01:13:17,203
- You guys had problems.
- Everybody has problems.

1113
01:13:17,274 --> 01:13:19,003
Everybody has bad times.

1114
01:13:19,076 --> 01:13:22,876
Do we sacrifice all of the good
times because of them?

1115
01:13:22,947 --> 01:13:24,608
No.

1116
01:13:40,664 --> 01:13:43,599
How did you like your hot dog?

1117
01:13:43,667 --> 01:13:47,535
Oh! It's not really a dog. They just
call it a hot dog here.

1118
01:13:50,107 --> 01:13:53,873
- It's quite excellent.
- Good.

1119
01:13:53,944 --> 01:13:57,812
Well! This has been a splendid date.

1120
01:13:57,881 --> 01:14:00,941
- Shall we go?
- Go where?

1121
01:14:01,018 --> 01:14:03,578
Back to Andalasia, of course.
To be married.

1122
01:14:03,654 --> 01:14:06,179
To live happily ever after
forever and ever.

1123
01:14:06,256 --> 01:14:11,250
Oh. Well, we don't have
to go right away.

1124
01:14:13,931 --> 01:14:16,900
How long do these dates usually last?

1125
01:14:16,967 --> 01:14:18,628
Oh, well...

1126
01:14:18,702 --> 01:14:22,069
They can go as long as you want, really.

1127
01:14:22,139 --> 01:14:24,266
They can just keep going and going,

1128
01:14:24,341 --> 01:14:27,538
just so long as you keep thinking
about activities that you can do.

1129
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:30,478
- Activities?
- We could go to the museum.

1130
01:14:30,547 --> 01:14:34,074
Or to the theater?

1131
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:37,848
- Or there's this ball.
- A ball?

1132
01:14:37,921 --> 01:14:39,582
Yes.

1133
01:14:39,656 --> 01:14:41,715
There's dancing and music.

1134
01:14:41,792 --> 01:14:44,352
- You like that.
- Well, I suppose.

1135
01:14:44,428 --> 01:14:46,225
Oh, wonderful.
We should go then.

1136
01:14:46,296 --> 01:14:48,924
- Giselle?
- Yes?

1137
01:14:48,999 --> 01:14:53,527
- And then home to Andalasia?
- Of course.

1138
01:14:53,604 --> 01:14:55,367
The moment it's over.

1139
01:14:59,276 --> 01:15:01,801
Giselle! You're back!
You're back!

1140
01:15:01,879 --> 01:15:05,747
Oh, Morgan. Oh!
Morgan, I need your help.

1141
01:15:05,816 --> 01:15:09,775
I'm going to the ball, and I'm not sure
what to do, or what I should wear.

1142
01:15:09,853 --> 01:15:12,822
I don't know where to find
a fairy godmother at this late hour.

1143
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:16,621
I have something better
than a fairy godmother.

1144
01:15:18,996 --> 01:15:22,329
Daddy says it's only for emergencies.

1145
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:25,232
This is definitely an emergency.

1146
01:15:36,246 --> 01:15:38,578
Here you go,
you get to carry the bag.

1147
01:15:38,649 --> 01:15:41,345
- Bye.
- Bye.

1148
01:15:41,418 --> 01:15:42,942
Next.

1149
01:15:53,664 --> 01:15:57,361
- Miss?
- Oh. Thank you.

1150
01:15:57,434 --> 01:15:58,924
Have a good day.

1151
01:16:02,639 --> 01:16:06,006
And when you go out, you don't
want to wear too much makeup.

1152
01:16:06,076 --> 01:16:08,567
'Cause otherwise
the boys get the wrong idea.

1153
01:16:08,645 --> 01:16:11,409
And you know how they are.

1154
01:16:11,482 --> 01:16:13,814
They're only after one thing.

1155
01:16:13,884 --> 01:16:16,978
- What's that?
- I don't know.

1156
01:16:17,054 --> 01:16:18,487
Nobody will tell me.

1157
01:16:19,289 --> 01:16:20,620
Oh.

1158
01:16:20,691 --> 01:16:24,787
So is this what it's like?

1159
01:16:24,862 --> 01:16:27,797
- What, sweetie?
- Going shopping with your mother?

1160
01:16:27,865 --> 01:16:31,562
Oh, I don't know. I've never
been shopping with my mother.

1161
01:16:31,635 --> 01:16:33,603
Me either.

1162
01:16:33,670 --> 01:16:36,605
- But I like it.
- Me too.

1163
01:16:36,673 --> 01:16:40,006
And just think.
Soon, you'll have a new mother.

1164
01:16:40,077 --> 01:16:42,068
You mean stepmother.

1165
01:16:42,146 --> 01:16:44,444
It's not true what they say.

1166
01:16:44,515 --> 01:16:48,349
I have met so many kind
and wonderful stepmothers.

1167
01:16:48,418 --> 01:16:50,750
Edward has a stepmother.

1168
01:16:50,821 --> 01:16:54,279
I've never met her,
but I hear she's just lovely.

1169
01:17:31,528 --> 01:17:36,261
<i>Mr. N is on the line telling us
his sweetie pie is acting distant.</i>

1170
01:17:36,333 --> 01:17:37,766
<i>You were saying, Mr. N?</i>

1171
01:17:37,834 --> 01:17:40,200
I've always treated her like a queen,

1172
01:17:40,270 --> 01:17:43,103
but lately I'm starting to feel

1173
01:17:43,173 --> 01:17:46,904
there's this whole other side to her,
like I don't even know her anymore.

1174
01:17:48,579 --> 01:17:50,570
<i>I think you need
to take her aside</i>

1175
01:17:50,647 --> 01:17:55,414
<i>and find out how she
really feels about you.</i>

1176
01:17:55,485 --> 01:17:58,648
Hello, worthless.
Miss me?

1177
01:18:01,124 --> 01:18:06,653
Reperio lemma miha!

1178
01:18:19,977 --> 01:18:21,376
A-ha!

1179
01:19:17,000 --> 01:19:19,969
- What is she doing here?
- I have no idea.

1180
01:19:22,105 --> 01:19:24,539
- I'm surprised to see you here.
- I'm surprised.

1181
01:19:24,608 --> 01:19:27,099
- You said you couldn't dance.
- I said I didn't.

1182
01:19:27,177 --> 01:19:30,112
I never said I couldn't.

1183
01:19:31,214 --> 01:19:34,650
Oh. This is Edward.
He's my, um...

1184
01:19:36,086 --> 01:19:38,486
...prince.
- And this is Nancy.

1185
01:19:38,555 --> 01:19:40,580
She's... Well, she's...

1186
01:19:40,657 --> 01:19:41,885
- We're together.
- Yes.

1187
01:19:43,327 --> 01:19:47,525
And this beautiful lady is
Giselle, the love of my life.

1188
01:19:47,597 --> 01:19:51,294
- My heart's true desire.
- Wow.

1189
01:19:51,368 --> 01:19:54,337
- Is something wrong?
- Just the way you said that.

1190
01:19:54,404 --> 01:19:57,532
So straightforward.
Not a hint of irony.

1191
01:19:57,607 --> 01:20:00,701
It's very... romantic.

1192
01:20:00,777 --> 01:20:02,506
Well, thank you.

1193
01:20:02,579 --> 01:20:05,241
Well, folks,
it's that time of night.

1194
01:20:05,315 --> 01:20:08,716
I'd like to ask each gentleman
to invite a lady

1195
01:20:08,785 --> 01:20:14,587
he did not accompany this evening
to dance the King and Queen's Waltz.

1196
01:20:17,728 --> 01:20:21,630
- May I have the pleasure?
- Please.

1197
01:20:32,309 --> 01:20:33,936
Shall we?

1198
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:40,941
<i>You're in my arms</i>

1199
01:20:41,017 --> 01:20:44,316
<i>And all the world is gone</i>

1200
01:20:44,388 --> 01:20:47,721
<i>The music playing on</i>

1201
01:20:47,791 --> 01:20:51,090
<i>For only two</i>

1202
01:20:52,028 --> 01:20:56,522
<i>So close together</i>

1203
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,898
<i>And when I'm with you</i>

1204
01:20:58,969 --> 01:21:04,635
<i>So close to feeling alive</i>

1205
01:21:07,544 --> 01:21:11,344
<i>A life goes by</i>

1206
01:21:11,415 --> 01:21:14,714
<i>Romantic dreams must die</i>

1207
01:21:14,785 --> 01:21:18,346
<i>So I bid mine goodbye</i>

1208
01:21:18,422 --> 01:21:22,916
<i>And never knew</i>

1209
01:21:22,993 --> 01:21:26,929
<i>So close was waiting</i>

1210
01:21:26,997 --> 01:21:29,557
<i>Waiting here with you</i>

1211
01:21:29,633 --> 01:21:34,866
<i>And now forever I know</i>

1212
01:21:36,506 --> 01:21:39,839
<i>All that I want is</i>

1213
01:21:39,910 --> 01:21:43,607
<i>To hold you</i>

1214
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,581
<i>So close</i>

1215
01:21:46,650 --> 01:21:50,518
<i>So close to reaching</i>

1216
01:21:50,587 --> 01:21:52,953
<i>That famous happy ending</i>

1217
01:21:53,023 --> 01:21:57,357
<i>Almost believing</i>

1218
01:21:57,427 --> 01:22:00,191
<i>This one's not pretend</i>

1219
01:22:00,263 --> 01:22:03,994
<i>Now you're beside me</i>

1220
01:22:04,067 --> 01:22:09,061
<i>And look how far we've come</i>

1221
01:22:09,139 --> 01:22:12,040
<i>So far</i>

1222
01:22:12,108 --> 01:22:15,373
<i>We are</i>

1223
01:22:15,445 --> 01:22:20,348
<i>So close</i>

1224
01:22:55,151 --> 01:22:56,709
Mind if I cut in?

1225
01:22:59,322 --> 01:23:00,983
No, of course.

1226
01:23:01,057 --> 01:23:06,723
<i>If I should lose you now</i>

1227
01:23:08,231 --> 01:23:11,962
<i>We're so close</i>

1228
01:23:12,035 --> 01:23:14,026
<i>To reaching</i>

1229
01:23:14,104 --> 01:23:16,595
<i>That famous happy ending</i>

1230
01:23:16,673 --> 01:23:20,734
<i>Almost believing</i>

1231
01:23:20,810 --> 01:23:24,576
<i>This one's not pretend</i>

1232
01:23:24,648 --> 01:23:28,311
- You're sad.
- Oh, no.

1233
01:23:28,385 --> 01:23:32,344
- I'm fine.
- I'll get your wrap.

1234
01:23:36,226 --> 01:23:40,492
<i>So close</i>

1235
01:23:40,564 --> 01:23:43,226
<i>So close</i>

1236
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:49,000
<i>And still so far</i>

1237
01:24:09,593 --> 01:24:13,120
Child.

1238
01:24:13,196 --> 01:24:16,529
You! You sent me here.

1239
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:20,832
I'm so glad to see you.
I was so very worried.

1240
01:24:20,904 --> 01:24:24,772
What a terrible accident that brought
you to this terrible place

1241
01:24:24,841 --> 01:24:30,370
with so much sadness
and so much pain.

1242
01:24:30,447 --> 01:24:33,473
Oh, yes.

1243
01:24:33,550 --> 01:24:37,543
To never be with the one you love.

1244
01:24:37,621 --> 01:24:40,647
Doomed to be with another

1245
01:24:40,724 --> 01:24:42,954
for eternity.

1246
01:24:43,026 --> 01:24:46,359
Oh! But it doesn't have to be that way.

1247
01:24:46,429 --> 01:24:50,297
Oh, no, no, no.
I can stop the hurt. Yes.

1248
01:24:50,367 --> 01:24:55,304
I can make all those
bad memories disappear.

1249
01:24:56,573 --> 01:24:59,371
Yes!

1250
01:24:59,442 --> 01:25:03,139
Just one bite, my love,

1251
01:25:03,213 --> 01:25:07,172
and all this will go away.

1252
01:25:08,585 --> 01:25:10,917
Your life here,

1253
01:25:10,987 --> 01:25:13,421
the people that you met.

1254
01:25:13,490 --> 01:25:17,085
You won't remember anything.

1255
01:25:18,194 --> 01:25:20,685
Just sweet dreams...

1256
01:25:22,032 --> 01:25:24,660
...and happy endings.

1257
01:25:35,211 --> 01:25:39,011
But you must hurry. You must hurry.
The magic will not work

1258
01:25:39,082 --> 01:25:43,678
unless you take a bite
before the clock strikes 12.

1259
01:25:43,753 --> 01:25:46,620
Hurry now. Hurry. Hurry.

1260
01:25:46,690 --> 01:25:49,284
Yes! Yes! Yes!
That's it. That's it.

1261
01:25:49,359 --> 01:25:51,919
Hurry. Hurry. Yes.

1262
01:26:21,958 --> 01:26:24,256
Out of my way!

1263
01:26:27,931 --> 01:26:29,398
How did she do that?

1264
01:26:36,806 --> 01:26:40,765
Speciosus, formosus,

1265
01:26:40,844 --> 01:26:43,472
praeclarus!

1266
01:26:44,914 --> 01:26:47,212
- Ah!
- Edward?

1267
01:26:47,283 --> 01:26:50,252
- Mother?
- Edward!

1268
01:26:52,522 --> 01:26:54,547
Yes. Oh, her.

1269
01:26:54,624 --> 01:26:56,524
I was taking her out for fresh air.

1270
01:26:56,593 --> 01:26:59,255
She seems to have swooned.
Oh, leave her, darling.

1271
01:26:59,329 --> 01:27:02,093
I think she's fine.
Just leave her. Slap her.

1272
01:27:02,165 --> 01:27:04,133
Give her some water.
She's fine.

1273
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:07,499
- Someone help me, please!
- You're overreacting.

1274
01:27:07,570 --> 01:27:09,561
You needn't get so upset, dear.
Really.

1275
01:27:09,639 --> 01:27:13,405
Oh, no. Call 9-1-1.

1276
01:27:13,476 --> 01:27:16,036
Don't pay any attention.
Go back to your party.

1277
01:27:16,112 --> 01:27:18,672
- She's fine.
- Giselle.

1278
01:27:21,217 --> 01:27:23,981
Hello, we have a woman
here, she's unconscious.

1279
01:27:24,053 --> 01:27:25,816
I didn't see what happened.

1280
01:27:25,889 --> 01:27:29,154
- She fainted. But she'll be fine...
- No, she didn't.

1281
01:27:29,225 --> 01:27:32,592
Nathaniel, go back to the car.

1282
01:27:32,662 --> 01:27:34,323
I will not.

1283
01:27:35,999 --> 01:27:39,162
You poisoned her.

1284
01:27:39,235 --> 01:27:41,294
- She's the evil hag, sire!
- You did this?

1285
01:27:41,371 --> 01:27:45,899
She sent the girl here.
She poisoned her! With my help,

1286
01:27:45,975 --> 01:27:49,502
- I regret to say.
- Oh, he's lying, darling.

1287
01:27:49,579 --> 01:27:53,413
Why would I ever align myself with that
buffoon? I mean, think about it. Why...?

1288
01:27:53,483 --> 01:27:58,443
Silence!
You lying, murderous wretch!

1289
01:27:58,521 --> 01:28:01,490
When we return home, Andalasia
shall know of your treachery.

1290
01:28:01,558 --> 01:28:06,188
- Your days as queen will be over!
- Take my crown?

1291
01:28:06,262 --> 01:28:09,129
Don't you think that's
a bit melodramatic, dear?

1292
01:28:09,199 --> 01:28:11,394
I don't know
what "melodramatic" means,

1293
01:28:11,467 --> 01:28:14,664
but you'll be removed from the throne,
Narissa. I will see to it.

1294
01:28:25,682 --> 01:28:29,118
That's enough from you, you viper.

1295
01:28:29,185 --> 01:28:32,382
- We have to help her. What can we do?
- I don't know. What do we do?

1296
01:28:32,455 --> 01:28:35,447
There's no way of helping her.
She's done for.

1297
01:28:39,929 --> 01:28:41,055
True love's kiss.

1298
01:28:42,932 --> 01:28:44,524
What?

1299
01:28:44,601 --> 01:28:46,831
It's the most powerful thing
in the world.

1300
01:28:46,903 --> 01:28:48,427
Yes. Yes, of course.

1301
01:28:53,276 --> 01:28:54,834
I knew that.

1302
01:29:10,226 --> 01:29:12,524
It's not working!

1303
01:29:15,965 --> 01:29:19,560
You'll never save her now.
When the clock strikes 12...

1304
01:29:20,703 --> 01:29:21,795
...she'll be dead.

1305
01:29:24,140 --> 01:29:26,165
- Unless...
- Unless?

1306
01:29:28,578 --> 01:29:31,411
It's not possible.
It couldn't be me.

1307
01:29:31,481 --> 01:29:34,041
- Don't you see?
- I've only known her for a few days.

1308
01:29:34,117 --> 01:29:37,280
Kiss her, Robert. It's OK.

1309
01:29:47,597 --> 01:29:49,121
Please.

1310
01:29:50,166 --> 01:29:51,963
Don't leave me.

1311
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:22,793
I knew it was you.

1312
01:30:33,209 --> 01:30:35,609
- What did you think?
- Wonderful.

1313
01:30:35,678 --> 01:30:37,908
Oh, much better
than last year's show.

1314
01:30:37,981 --> 01:30:41,644
No!

1315
01:30:45,355 --> 01:30:49,314
The most powerful thing
in the world.

1316
01:30:49,392 --> 01:30:53,590
Ha! I don't think so.

1317
01:30:53,663 --> 01:30:58,032
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

1318
01:30:58,101 --> 01:31:02,538
You want a show?
I'll give you a show.

1319
01:31:02,605 --> 01:31:05,836
Back up and get ready
for the main event!

1320
01:31:05,908 --> 01:31:08,877
- You selfish, evil...
- Speciosus,

1321
01:31:08,945 --> 01:31:12,574
formosus, praeclarus!

1322
01:31:25,294 --> 01:31:29,856
All this nauseating talk of
"true love's kiss."

1323
01:31:29,932 --> 01:31:32,526
It really does bring out
the worst in me.

1324
01:31:32,602 --> 01:31:35,093
- Stay back.
- You know, I've been thinking.

1325
01:31:35,171 --> 01:31:38,106
If I'm going to remain queen,
I'm going to need

1326
01:31:38,174 --> 01:31:41,701
some sort of story
when I go back. Hmm.

1327
01:31:41,778 --> 01:31:46,511
What if a giant,
vicious beast showed up

1328
01:31:46,582 --> 01:31:49,176
and killed everyone?

1329
01:31:49,252 --> 01:31:52,915
And poor, defenseless
Queen Narissa,

1330
01:31:52,989 --> 01:31:55,253
she just couldn't save them.

1331
01:31:55,324 --> 01:31:59,988
Let's begin with the girl
who started it all, shall we?

1332
01:32:00,063 --> 01:32:03,794
- Over my dead body.
- All right.

1333
01:32:03,866 --> 01:32:07,563
- I'm flexible.
- Let me go!

1334
01:32:09,672 --> 01:32:14,006
Come along, Giselle. I don't
want you to miss this ending.

1335
01:32:33,529 --> 01:32:35,963
Let me go!

1336
01:32:36,032 --> 01:32:39,229
Ah! Put me down!
You're crazy!

1337
01:32:39,302 --> 01:32:42,863
No, spiteful, vindictive, very large.

1338
01:32:42,939 --> 01:32:46,102
But never crazy. Ah!

1339
01:32:47,977 --> 01:32:51,811
- Giselle!
- Oh, my. This is a twist on our story!

1340
01:32:51,881 --> 01:32:56,011
It's the brave little princess
coming to the rescue.

1341
01:32:56,085 --> 01:32:59,987
I guess that makes you the damsel
in distress, huh, handsome?

1342
01:33:00,056 --> 01:33:05,255
Keep up with me, dear. It's time
to take our tale to new heights!

1343
01:33:25,314 --> 01:33:26,838
Pip!

1344
01:33:30,219 --> 01:33:32,915
You'd like to finally be released...

1345
01:33:32,989 --> 01:33:34,650
...to help Giselle...

1346
01:33:34,724 --> 01:33:36,988
...to best the beast.

1347
01:33:37,059 --> 01:33:39,027
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

1348
01:33:41,631 --> 01:33:42,757
Thank you.

1349
01:33:44,600 --> 01:33:48,036
Narissa! I'm not going
to let you take him!

1350
01:33:48,104 --> 01:33:51,596
We're coming to the end
of our story now.

1351
01:33:51,674 --> 01:33:53,835
Are you at the edge
of your seat, Giselle,

1352
01:33:53,910 --> 01:33:57,573
just dying to know how it ends?

1353
01:33:57,647 --> 01:33:59,512
Pip!

1354
01:34:04,453 --> 01:34:06,284
How about this:

1355
01:34:06,355 --> 01:34:11,019
"And they all lived
happily ever after!"

1356
01:34:11,093 --> 01:34:16,121
Well, at least I did.

1357
01:34:22,572 --> 01:34:24,130
What?

1358
01:34:35,251 --> 01:34:38,015
Oh. Ah!

1359
01:34:38,087 --> 01:34:42,251
Ow! Ah!

1360
01:34:57,707 --> 01:34:59,675
Robert! Hold on!

1361
01:35:02,612 --> 01:35:05,581
Ah!

1362
01:35:27,870 --> 01:35:31,431
Is this a habit of yours?
Falling off of stuff?

1363
01:35:31,507 --> 01:35:34,999
Only when you're around
