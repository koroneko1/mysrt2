-Just leave us be, all right?

352
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:01,083
Posh girls like you
don't belong in this fight.

[audience cheers and applauds]

354
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,916
Posh or not,
one thing I am good at is fighting.

355
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,458
Now tell me, where is she hiding
and what does she know?

356
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,875
You got more to you than I thought.

357
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,583
[clears throat] Whatever this is,
Mae is on stage in 30 ticks,

358
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,416
and she's still dressed as a gent.

359
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,708
So let go of her, now.

360
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,041
-Get her out of here.
-[man] Be my pleasure.

361
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,708
[chuckles] Come on.

362
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,916
Where did Sarah Chapman do her makeup?

363
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,000
[man] Full of secrets that one,
and not a bad actress.

364
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:46,291
I'd have given her the boot
if she weren't so good,

365
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:48,625
but she did attract the men
with big pockets.

366
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:50,250
Always useful that. Shift it.

367
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,041
Which men?

368
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:55,250
[sighs]

369
00:20:57,541 --> 00:21:01,083
There was this one gent, society type,
and he came regular.

370
00:21:01,166 --> 00:21:06,500
Very keen on him she was.
He'd send flowers, letters.

371
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,333
[intriguing music plays]

372
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:12,916
His name?

373
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:17,583
Never gave one.

374
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:22,541
[chuckles] You see, they all think there's
hope. That love is coming their way.

375
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,000
But it never is.

376
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,250
Blokes like that, they want cheap,

377
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,375
but they marry dear.

378
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:35,500
"As we two ate of the fruit of love…"

379
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,083
The fruit of love? Ugh.

With its blossoms white"

"A chapel awaits us out of sight"

383
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:48,791
And a poppy.

384
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:50,458
Is that his name?

385
00:21:52,541 --> 00:21:53,958
Why did she leave?

00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,041
[intriguing music plays]

387
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:00,833
Did she run away with this fellow?

388
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:05,875
Or is she running from him?

389
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:10,916
I hope it's the latter.
His poetry is extremely bad.

Be away with you, boy.

398
00:23:03,083 --> 00:23:03,916
[man] All right.

-Sherlock?
-Enola.

What are you doing here? It's not safe.

402
00:23:13,708 --> 00:23:15,333
There are scary people about.

403
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,083
-Yes, let me know when you meet one.
-[Sherlock sighs drunkenly]

404
00:23:19,791 --> 00:23:22,208
-Brother, are you quite yourself?
-I'm fine.

405
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:25,833
It was just a disagreement
over a glass of wine

406
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:27,583
and whose wine it was.

407
00:23:27,666 --> 00:23:28,541
And, uh…

408
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:33,833
I find after wine, it's very difficult
to make your arms and legs move.

409
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:34,875
Let's get you home.

410
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:40,000
I don't usually imbibe,
but I'm on a case, you see.

411
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,708
-It's proven rather tricky.
-[Enola] Cab.

412

-[Sherlock] Hello.
-[Enola] Hello.

413

-[Enola grunts]
-[humorous music playing lightly]

[Enola] As it turns out,
my brother is medievally heavy.

416
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:01,250
It's like carrying a dead horse
on which sits another dead horse.

417
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,916
That's A, and I'm B.

[humorous music continues]

419
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,916
I didn't know you had steps.

420
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,500
One should always have steps
to avoid people stepping on you.

421
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:17,708
That's a tip.
You should probably write that down.

422
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:20,541
[sighs] All right. Lift your right leg.

423
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:22,166
[Sherlock] Mm-hmm.

424
00:24:23,875 --> 00:24:24,708
Now your left.

425
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:28,833
Better leg, the left.
You should write that down.

00:24:39,125 --> 00:24:40,125
I can do it.

-It's perfect. Don't touch anything.

[Enola] What are you investigating?

437
00:25:04,541 --> 00:25:06,875
[Sherlock] None of your business.
I work alone. It's private.

438
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,291
Now shh, I'm thinking.

439
00:25:09,791 --> 00:25:11,875
One should never be interrupted
when thinking.

440
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:15,125
-Oh. You should--
-Write that down?

441

-[clanging]
-Shh!

And why, pray, have you moved everything?

Your head is sore? I can't think why.

[Sherlock] This is why
I don't have people in my rooms.

Look what you've done.
My papers are entirely out of order.

Your case, it's vexing you.

Seems to be an awful lot of question marks
on that map of yours.

-I will see you again.
-Is that why you're drinking?

00:26:26,208 --> 00:26:29,041
I'm more than certain… [sniffs]
…it's not so old.

461
00:26:29,125 --> 00:26:31,416
-Maybe I can help.
-You can help by leaving.

462
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,958
Huh. Yes. The world
will be a much safer place

463
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:39,208
if we don't see the inside
of Sherlock Holmes, only the out.

464
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:42,083
Crazy idea.

465
00:26:43,125 --> 00:26:45,208
Have you ever considered a flatmate?

466
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,041
-For what purpose?
-To stop you descending into this.

467
00:26:52,375 --> 00:26:53,250
Strange

468
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:58,250
how those seeking advice
so often like to dispense it.

469
00:26:58,333 --> 00:27:01,041
Did I ask for advice?
I found you on the street, drunk.

470
00:27:01,125 --> 00:27:04,333
-Now what may I observe about you?
-We're not playing this game.

-You and Mycroft are so similar.
-You need to wash your clothes.

-Unwilling to look past--
-You are pale--

-Stop!
-And then there's your fingernails.

-Why are you working in a match factory?
-What?

traces. This morning, they are black.

The phosphorous from the match-making
has mixed with oxygen.

478
00:27:24,125 --> 00:27:27,041
I wasn't in such a state
as to not see that.

-[Sherlock] And your neck is red.

or held a knife against…

[Enola] How dare he?
How dare he lecture me?

491
00:28:11,708 --> 00:28:13,416
When he can't even solve his own case

492
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,666
and he lives in a bed of flummoxing papers
and bewildering mold.

493
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:19,375
How dare he claim I'm desperate?
It is not true.

494
00:28:19,875 --> 00:28:21,750
-And this is not fair.
-[Tewkesbury] Enola?

495
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
It is you.

496
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,208
And it is you.

497
00:28:32,041 --> 00:28:33,041
[Tewkesbury] How are you?

498
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,333
Are you well? You look…

499
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:40,708
I'm on a case. Undercover. Forget
I told you that piece of information.

500
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:44,625
It's the strangest thing. I could have
sworn I've seen you here before.

501
00:28:46,166 --> 00:28:47,125
Is that right?

502
00:28:47,208 --> 00:28:50,250
Well, this is my…
My route through to the Lords.

503
00:28:50,916 --> 00:28:53,458
Is it? [chuckles awkwardly] How lovely.

504
00:28:53,541 --> 00:28:56,083
Well, I… I breakfast here on occasion.

505
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:03,750
I mean, yes, it's a lovely place.
I-I know the gardener here.

506
00:29:04,625 --> 00:29:07,000
We've been discussing
what to sow for next year's crop.

507
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,416
Some fine sunflowers.

508
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,375
Uh, Sweet Williams,
for their lovely vivid reds.

509
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,000
I've seen all you're doing.

510
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:16,625
Oh. Well, it's… It's nothing.

511
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:18,041
In the society pages.

512
00:29:21,791 --> 00:29:23,625
You are quite the eligible bachelor.

513
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,125
Don't believe all you read.

514
00:29:33,208 --> 00:29:34,250
I wrote to you.

515
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:37,250
You didn't reply.

516
00:29:37,875 --> 00:29:38,708
Uh…

517
00:29:39,666 --> 00:29:41,583
I… was busy.

518
00:29:42,083 --> 00:29:44,625
Starting my own business.
A perpetual challenge.

519
00:29:45,125 --> 00:29:46,833
Perhaps, not something you'd understand.

520
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:50,041
-Well, Enola, if you need help--
-I do not.

521
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:54,583
Should my problem become horticultural,
I shall seek you out.

522
00:29:56,166 --> 00:29:57,000
Right.

523
00:29:57,583 --> 00:30:00,250
Well, you know where to find me

524
00:30:02,166 --> 00:30:03,500
should a plant go missing.

525
00:30:04,041 --> 00:30:05,583
I hope you enjoy your breakfast.

526
00:30:09,916 --> 00:30:10,750
Yeah.

528
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,500
[whispering] Is he looking back?

529
00:30:20,583 --> 00:30:22,458
[in normal voice] Oh. Good, he isn't.

530
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,250
I don't come here every day.

531
00:30:27,166 --> 00:30:28,791
Just on days when I feel a need.

532
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:33,833
And sometimes he doesn't take this path.
Sometimes he takes the parallel one.

533
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:41,125
-[sighs]
-[echoing] You know where to find me.

"Two ate." Two-eight.

Twenty-eight.

There is a certain satisfaction
that you feel as a detective

[boy] There's a new Holmes in town.

That's right. Sherlock Holmes
has met his match.

564
00:31:52,166 --> 00:31:55,541
My name will be known,
and Bessie will have a sister once again.

-She… She's--
-Dead.

594
00:34:14,958 --> 00:34:15,875
How'd that happen?

595
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:24,333
Oh, no, no, no. I'm investigating a case.
A disappearance of a girl.

596
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:27,458
-What, that girl?
-No. No, no, no. H-Her name is Mae.

00:34:58,041 --> 00:35:00,541
I was sent to investigate
a possible disturbance.

605
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:03,791
Someone heard some screams,
and then I discovered this young lady.

Her name?

Enola Holmes.

Uh, his sister.

-Ten past the hour, sir.

619

When did you arrive, detective?

620
00:35:41,166 --> 00:35:42,333
A-Around the same time.

Uh, no, I was trying to suppress
the blood. I-I was trying to save her.

624
00:35:51,416 --> 00:35:53,666
Or trying to get information out of her.

625
00:35:55,375 --> 00:35:56,875
Give her a search, inspector.

626
00:35:56,958 --> 00:35:59,666
Oh, I couldn't. I can't pat her down, sir.

627

Come along, Lestrade.
Let's not be coy about this.

What's this?

633
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:24,750
My evidence.

634
00:36:26,291 --> 00:36:27,208
And that?

[tense music plays]

636
00:36:30,041 --> 00:36:31,208
It's nothing.

637
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:32,750
Then why are you hiding it?

638
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:37,041
Found at a murder scene
with a freshly dead corpse,

639
00:36:37,125 --> 00:36:39,583

What can't I believe, missy?

642
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:47,625
That young ladies
don't have the hands for killing?

643
00:36:47,708 --> 00:36:48,750
Now, give them here.

Take it. I have others.

Is it another Brixton Strangler?

Oh dear.

[tense music crescendos]

704
00:39:49,083 --> 00:39:50,875
Whoa! [groans]

705
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:54,333
My mistake.
I should have warned you I was opening it.

706
00:39:57,416 --> 00:39:58,250
No.

707
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:00,375

[jaunty music plays]

709
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,916
Dare I ask?

710
00:40:08,541 --> 00:40:10,291
[gasps]

711
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:11,666
[jaunty music fades]

712
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,875
Good afternoon.

713
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,208
May I ask a favor?

714
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:17,166
[jaunty music plays]

715
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:23,333
Never mind. Tell me everything.

716
00:40:24,166 --> 00:40:25,708
-A government case?
-No.

717
00:40:26,916 --> 00:40:28,916
[Lestrade] Is it
another Brixton Strangler?

718
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:32,125
Or… Or a Periwinkle?

719
00:40:32,708 --> 00:40:34,875
"You tell me yours
and I'll tell you mine."

720
00:40:36,041 --> 00:40:38,500
He's a ninny. I needed to know
what he had on you.

721
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:46,083
Money. Unaccounted transfers
going in and out of government offices.

722
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,458
My theory is either bribery,
extortion, or blackmail.

723
00:40:49,541 --> 00:40:50,875
And what have you found?

724
00:40:52,666 --> 00:40:54,750
Separate filings
from five different accounts

725
00:40:54,833 --> 00:40:58,041
going via the Treasury
into one private bank.

726
00:40:58,125 --> 00:41:00,791
-So someone is getting rich from this?
-Yes.

727
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,166
[intriguing music plays]

728
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:04,041
-Who?
-No name.

729
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:05,541
Just a number.

730
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:08,583
I visited the bank and inquired.
The money disappeared,

731
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:10,833
arriving at another bank,
and then another,

732
00:41:10,916 --> 00:41:13,083
and another, and another,
and another, and another.

733
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:16,833
Every one of them hidden
using different account numbers.

734
00:41:16,916 --> 00:41:18,083
Twenty-seven in total.

735
00:41:18,166 --> 00:41:21,583
-Well, what can you deduce from that?
-Three things.

736
00:41:22,166 --> 00:41:25,916
Firstly, the man's a game player,
perhaps a genius in mathematics,

737
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,083
capable of covering his traces
at every turn.

738
00:41:28,166 --> 00:41:30,541
Secondly, the sources are varied.

739
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,958
Five banks, south of the river,
but no clear link between them.

740
00:41:34,541 --> 00:41:35,875
All anonymous.

741
00:41:35,958 --> 00:41:39,125
All going into one pocket.

742
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:41,541
And the third?

743
00:41:44,791 --> 00:41:45,875
He knows I'm onto him.

744
00:41:47,416 --> 00:41:48,250
What? How?

745
00:41:48,333 --> 00:41:51,833
Every time I pull a thread,
it loosens, vanishes,

746
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:54,625
reappears somewhere else.
He's leading me a merry dance.

747
00:41:54,708 --> 00:41:55,541
It's…

748
00:41:57,958 --> 00:41:58,916
It's infuriating.

749
00:42:00,083 --> 00:42:02,083
So no leads whatsoever?

750
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,416
One. A week before the first transfer,

751
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,166
there was a break-in
at the Treasury office

752
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:07,708
by a man in a taper crown hat.

753
00:42:07,791 --> 00:42:08,916
[Enola] A taper crown hat.

754
00:42:09,583 --> 00:42:10,875
-What was taken?
-A document.

755
00:42:10,958 --> 00:42:13,666
They won't talk about it.
Sensitive information presumably.

756
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:18,000
But how it connects to all of this
has so far eluded me.

757
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:21,000
Your turn. I hope the blood's not yours.

758
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm looking for a girl, Sarah Chapman.

759
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:27,041
Her sister employed me. Bessie.

760
00:42:28,125 --> 00:42:31,458
She worked at Lyons match factory by day,
and the music hall at night.

761
00:42:32,375 --> 00:42:33,250
She has a lover,

762
00:42:34,541 --> 00:42:36,291
whose flat I visited.

763
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,041
He'd given her this.

764
00:42:42,458 --> 00:42:43,666
28 Bell Place?

765
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,458
Whitechapel, yes.

766
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:48,791
And there I found her friend,

767
00:42:50,083 --> 00:42:50,916
murdered.

768
00:42:55,208 --> 00:42:57,541
And who killed her? This poppy fellow?

769
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:03,041
I suspect so.

770
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:05,791
Perhaps he kidnapped Sarah
and her friend discovered it.

771
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:08,041
[scoffs] Love.

772
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:10,250
What it does to people.

773
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,333
-How was she killed?
-A kitchen knife.

774
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:15,875
-Did you touch this weapon?
-No.

775
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:18,833
Then why did you run?

776
00:43:18,916 --> 00:43:20,500
I found more evidence on her.

777
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:22,416
This policeman wanted it.

778
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,333
-He has this walk.
-Grail.

779
00:43:26,125 --> 00:43:27,250
We have a history.

780
00:43:28,875 --> 00:43:30,375
[Enola] This was in her pocket.

781
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:34,583
[Sherlock sighs]

[slow fiddle music plays]

783
00:43:51,041 --> 00:43:52,250
It's as bad as the poem.

784
00:43:54,041 --> 00:43:55,625
-Leave it with me.
-No.

785
00:43:56,125 --> 00:43:58,333
It's mine, and it's important.

786
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:03,041
Grail said she had stolen something
and that she was blackmailing them.

787
00:44:03,666 --> 00:44:06,916
-Though Sarah wouldn't do that.
-You don't know this person.

788
00:44:08,083 --> 00:44:08,916
I feel I do.

789
00:44:09,916 --> 00:44:11,958
You came here running from the police.

790
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:13,791
Someone is already dead,

791
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:16,125
and you are now a suspect
in a murder case.

792
00:44:16,208 --> 00:44:18,166
You've let your emotions
get the better of you.

793
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:21,583
Stay here. Don't leave.
I will look into this.

794
00:44:21,666 --> 00:44:25,541
But Sarah Chapman is my responsibility.
No one else cares for these girls.

795
00:44:26,125 --> 00:44:27,666
I promised her sister.

796
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:29,541
The first mistake a detective makes

797
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:33,250
is to make it about themselves
and not the case.

798
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:43,416
Enola, I know you're not a fan
of unnecessary advice,

799
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,875
but please…

…don't turn into me.

00:44:53,875 --> 00:44:55,583

don't belong in this fight.

That love is coming their way.

But it never is.

[Enola] So, Poppy, you're a gent, are you?

816
00:45:30,166 --> 00:45:33,333
And a well-heeled one
to afford a love nest like that.

-Don't be ridiculous.

-Yes, Father.

And all along, I thought you were a poppy.

834
00:47:16,541 --> 00:47:19,666
Let's see how sweet you are,
Sweet William.

[inaudible speech]

1058
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,625
You admire Lord Tewkesbury?

1059
01:00:06,291 --> 01:00:07,291
No!

1060
01:00:08,125 --> 01:00:09,583
[clears throat] No.

1061
01:00:10,750 --> 01:00:12,416
We are old friends.

1062
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:15,708
I hear he's a good man,
and a great reformer.

1063
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:17,333
[Enola] Hm.

1064
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:21,041
Well, if you wish to dance with him,
you may have to wait.

1065
01:00:21,125 --> 01:00:22,250
There's quite a queue.

1066
01:00:25,250 --> 01:00:27,125
Yes, I mustn't lose my chance.

1067
01:00:29,625 --> 01:00:31,208
Good evening, Miss…?

1068
01:00:31,291 --> 01:00:32,208
Tabitha.

1069
01:00:33,041 --> 01:00:33,875
Cicely.

1070
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:43,791
Forgive me for interrupting.
My name is Cicely.

1071
01:00:43,875 --> 01:00:47,208
Um, your friend Tabitha
suggested we might dance.

1072
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:49,166
Did she?

1073
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,250
[soft music plays]

1074
01:00:56,416 --> 01:01:01,000
[man] Ladies and gentlemen, please
take your partners for the last waltz.

1075
01:01:01,083 --> 01:01:02,333
[tense music plays]

1076
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,458

[dramatic music plays]

1078
01:01:27,458 --> 01:01:29,916
You know, I swear I know your face.

1079
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,333
What must it be?

1080
01:01:31,916 --> 01:01:33,375
We have never met before,

1081
01:01:34,250 --> 01:01:36,208
but I've seen you looking. Why?

1082
01:01:36,291 --> 01:01:37,666
[dramatic music continues]

1083
01:01:39,958 --> 01:01:42,500
[Enola] Of course. The Paragon Music Hall.

1084
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:45,666
I saw you talking
with a young woman there.

1085
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,666
Sarah Chapman.

1086
01:01:49,541 --> 01:01:52,000
Dislocate from me and I will scream.

1087
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:55,666
The police are onto you, Mr. Lyon.
As it happens, they are onto us both.

1088
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:57,791
[dramatic music continues]

1089
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,958
You were not invited here.
What do you want?

1090
01:02:00,041 --> 01:02:03,625
[Enola] I'm a private detective,
hired by Sarah's sister to find her.

1091
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:05,500
Bessie hired you?

1092
01:02:05,583 --> 01:02:06,666
You know Bessie?

1093
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:10,125
Leave me be, please,

1094
01:02:11,041 --> 01:02:12,500
or you will ruin everything.

1095
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:16,000
-How? What will I ruin?
-They're watching.

1096
01:02:17,166 --> 01:02:21,000
If you must persist with this,
meet me in the library at midnight.

1097
01:02:22,041 --> 01:02:23,333
Say nothing more now.

1098
01:02:24,916 --> 01:02:26,041
Midnight it is.

1099
01:02:26,125 --> 01:02:28,166
[dramatic music continues]

1100
01:02:46,875 --> 01:02:47,791
[exhales]

1101
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:56,791
"Moriarty."

1102
01:02:59,333 --> 01:03:00,208
Who are you?

1103
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:03,958
[thunder rumbles]

1104
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,625
[clock ticks]

1105
01:03:08,791 --> 01:03:09,625
[gasps]

1106
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:14,958
-My word, you do get in awkward places.
-Why are you holding a poker?

1107
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:17,208
You must leave. I'm waiting for another.

1108
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:19,416
Another you're scared of
such that you need a weapon?

1109
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,750
You are always here
when I don't want you to be.

1110
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:23,416
And sometimes here when you do.

1111
01:03:23,958 --> 01:03:26,500
-What's the matter with you?
-Nothing that need concern you.

1112
01:03:28,166 --> 01:03:32,166
I like the look of the one you were
dancing with. What's her name, Cicely?

1113
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,958
She would make you an excellent wife.

1114
01:03:34,458 --> 01:03:36,291
Enola, I am concerned only for you.

1115
01:03:36,375 --> 01:03:39,333
Tewkesbury, if you're still here,
you may scare him away.

1116
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:42,375
-"Scare him"? All of this is over a man?
-[sighs]

1117
01:03:43,750 --> 01:03:45,250
Just leave.

1118
01:03:45,333 --> 01:03:48,125
[clock chiming]

1119
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:56,791
Lord Tewkesbury.

1120
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,166
[door opens]

1121
01:04:00,458 --> 01:04:02,416
Enola Holmes, you're under arrest.

1122
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:04,958
Try to escape,
and we will make this difficult.

1123
01:04:05,041 --> 01:04:08,416
Let's make it quiet and spare
the fine people any embarrassment.

1124
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,625
-Sir, whatever this is about, I'm sure--
-Murder, sir.

1125
01:04:13,458 --> 01:04:14,708
It's about murder.

1126
01:04:14,791 --> 01:04:16,708
[dramatic music plays]

1127
01:04:17,916 --> 01:04:19,500
Tewkesbury, it's all right.

1128
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:21,666
Constable, go on.

1129
01:04:23,291 --> 01:04:24,375
Keep them safe.

1130
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:27,916
-Please.
-[Lestrade] Come along.

1131
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,458
[dramatic music continues]

1132
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:32,833
Ow.

1133
01:04:35,541 --> 01:04:37,666
-[woman] Oh, I say.
-I knew she didn't belong here.

1134
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,916
[guests murmuring]

1135
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:44,041
[ladies laugh]

1136
01:04:45,958 --> 01:04:47,875
-Despicable.
-[woman] Disgraceful.

1137
01:04:47,958 --> 01:04:50,250
[dramatic music continues]

1138
01:04:57,791 --> 01:04:59,041
Quite a party.

1139
01:05:00,333 --> 01:05:03,541
You danced with young Master Lyon, I hear.

1140
01:05:04,916 --> 01:05:08,166
May I ask, impertinently, I'm sure,

1141
01:05:08,250 --> 01:05:09,708
did you want to kiss him,

1142
01:05:10,416 --> 01:05:12,541
or find out more about your case,

1143
01:05:13,250 --> 01:05:14,666
this Sarah Chapman?

1144
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:23,541
Look, if you're trying to protect her,

1145
01:05:24,458 --> 01:05:25,333
know this.

1146
01:05:26,291 --> 01:05:28,750
I will protect her better.

1147
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:32,000
There's someone wants to talk to her,

1148
01:05:32,750 --> 01:05:34,625
and they're not as kind as me.

1149
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,083
"Someone"?

1150
01:05:39,125 --> 01:05:39,958
Who?

1151
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:42,083
[thunder rumbles distantly]

1152
01:05:42,166 --> 01:05:44,750
Why were you following me that night?

1153
01:05:47,916 --> 01:05:50,416
You were following Mae too, weren't you?

1154
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:52,958
That's why you found the flat.

1155
01:05:57,416 --> 01:05:58,291
Nice shirt.

1156
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,166
Silk?

1157
01:06:01,041 --> 01:06:02,375
On a policeman's salary?

1158
01:06:04,583 --> 01:06:07,541
Who's paying you, Superintendent Grail?

1159
01:06:07,625 --> 01:06:10,000
Who's paying you to kill match girls?

1160
01:06:10,083 --> 01:06:11,916
Where's Sarah Chapman?

1161
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,416
-I don't know.
-She's a thief and a troublemaker.

1162
01:06:14,500 --> 01:06:16,875
You don't want to risk your skin for her.

1163
01:06:19,458 --> 01:06:23,125
Well, if I can't find it out from you,
I'll find it out from someone else,

1164
01:06:23,208 --> 01:06:26,041
like her sister, little Bessie.

1165
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,541
She's just a little girl.

1166
01:06:28,625 --> 01:06:31,291
Oh, but that's how it starts,
Enola Holmes!

1167
01:06:31,375 --> 01:06:35,708
With little girls like her,
and you, and Sarah Chapman,

1168
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:38,583
asking questions,
doubting those in charge,

1169
01:06:38,666 --> 01:06:40,958
not seeing their protection
for what it is,

1170
01:06:41,041 --> 01:06:42,583
trying to tear it down.

1171
01:06:43,250 --> 01:06:47,041
Well, it only takes one little flame
to start a fire,

1172
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:50,083
and my job is to keep
crushing those bloody flames out.

1173
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:55,166
Now, I'll be kind

1174
01:06:55,666 --> 01:06:57,500
and give you one last chance.

1175
01:06:59,833 --> 01:07:00,708
Where is she?

1176
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:03,208
I don't know.

1177
01:07:10,916 --> 01:07:12,375
Then you're for the noose.

1178
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:14,458
Some detective you were.

1179
01:07:14,541 --> 01:07:15,458
[keys jingling]

1180
01:07:16,041 --> 01:07:17,791
Should have stuck to needlework.

1181
01:07:31,541 --> 01:07:32,666
[policeman] Sir?

1182
01:07:32,750 --> 01:07:34,041
-Sir.
-[Sherlock] Don't be ridi--

1183
01:07:34,125 --> 01:07:35,000
[stick clangs]

1184
01:07:37,833 --> 01:07:39,166
Superintendent Grail.

1185
01:07:40,666 --> 01:07:42,166
Mr. Holmes.

1186
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:45,333
[Sherlock] I'm here for my sister.

1187
01:07:45,833 --> 01:07:47,708
If you can arrange her release,

1188
01:07:49,416 --> 01:07:50,583
I'd much appreciate it.

1189
01:07:52,625 --> 01:07:54,041
She is my ward and a minor.

1190
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:55,791
And a murderer.

1191
01:07:55,875 --> 01:07:58,208
Any evidence you think
you have against her--

1192
01:07:58,291 --> 01:07:59,541
I have plenty.

1193
01:08:00,875 --> 01:08:04,375
She was seen arguing with the victim,
following the victim,

1194
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:08,166
fighting with the victim, and lastly,
standing over the victim's dead body.

1195
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,041
And when we find her there,
with blood on her hands,

1196
01:08:11,125 --> 01:08:12,541
she bloody runs.

1197
01:08:15,416 --> 01:08:16,583
I saw your murder site.

1198
01:08:17,291 --> 01:08:19,041
[door creaks open]

1199
01:08:20,791 --> 01:08:24,416
Marks on and around the door
show that it was forced open,

1200
01:08:24,500 --> 01:08:25,791
and recently.

1201
01:08:25,875 --> 01:08:27,208
There were signs of a scuffle

1202
01:08:27,291 --> 01:08:30,291
and boot marks
from three separate intruders.

1203
01:08:30,375 --> 01:08:31,833
One of them heavyset,

1204
01:08:32,625 --> 01:08:35,416
judging by the height and extent
of the subsequent damage.

1205
01:08:36,416 --> 01:08:38,833
Traces of fabric and spots of blood

1206
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:42,750
suggests that there was
another occupant, likely female,

1207
01:08:42,833 --> 01:08:44,500
who seems to have fought back,

1208
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:47,583
using a sharp and improvised weapon…

1209
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:52,791
before escaping through the window.

1210
01:08:52,875 --> 01:08:55,125
This was a targeted
search and interrogation

1211
01:08:55,208 --> 01:08:57,291
in which two women were discovered,

1212
01:08:57,375 --> 01:08:59,416
and then my sister arrived,

1213
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:03,041
and you were curiously fast
to arrive after her.

1214
01:09:03,625 --> 01:09:06,250
Now, are you going to release her,
or shall I?

1215
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:12,416
-Sergeant Beeston, if you please.
-[Beeston] Sir.

1216
01:09:13,875 --> 01:09:15,375
Fingerprint matching.

1217
01:09:15,458 --> 01:09:17,375
New invention, Swiss.

1218
01:09:17,458 --> 01:09:20,166
-You have heard of it?
-I have.

1219
01:09:20,250 --> 01:09:22,041
[Grail] Would you care to look?

1220
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:24,708
[tense music plays]

1221
01:09:24,791 --> 01:09:27,083
Makes our work so much more efficient,

1222
01:09:28,125 --> 01:09:29,916
especially in a murder case.

1223
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,416
[tense music continues]

1224
01:09:36,333 --> 01:09:38,166
My sister never touched that weapon.

1225
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,125
Then why are her prints on it?

1226
01:09:47,250 --> 01:09:49,750
It's a great age we live in,
isn't it, Mr. Holmes?

1227
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:52,666

01:18:19,958 --> 01:18:23,958
So, um, how's that useless boy of yours?

1407
01:18:25,458 --> 01:18:26,875
I hear he's doing good work.

1408
01:18:27,708 --> 01:18:28,541
[Enola clicks tongue]

1409
01:18:29,125 --> 01:18:30,583
-He is.
-Uh-huh.

1410
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:34,708
Well then,
perhaps not so useless after all.

1411
01:18:35,875 --> 01:18:38,541
I wouldn't say he's "my boy."

1412
01:18:42,250 --> 01:18:46,458
You know, I sometimes think
I brought you up to be too independent.

1413
01:18:47,041 --> 01:18:49,208
-Mother!
-[Eudoria] I did it with all of you.

1414
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:53,458
Your purpose must be to find who you are.

1415
01:18:53,541 --> 01:18:56,333
You, Sherlock, Mycroft.

1416
01:18:56,833 --> 01:18:59,458
Strong, formidable, individual children,

1417
01:18:59,541 --> 01:19:03,166
but, well, perhaps a little lonely.

1418
01:19:06,041 --> 01:19:08,166
You will do very well on your own, Enola.

1419
01:19:08,916 --> 01:19:13,250
But with others, you could be magnificent.

1420
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:15,333
[gentle music plays]

1421
01:19:15,875 --> 01:19:19,375
Who do you think
organized all of this after all? Hm?

1422
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:20,708
Me?

1423
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:25,791
No, you find your allies.

1424
01:19:26,375 --> 01:19:29,750
Work with them,
and you will become more of who you are.

1425
01:19:31,041 --> 01:19:32,541
You speak with one voice,

1426
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:36,208
and you will make more noise
than you could ever have imagined.

1427
01:19:38,416 --> 01:19:42,041
Come on. She should go.
We'll put them off her scent.

1428
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:46,291
So, you dust yourself down…

[gentle music continues]

1430
01:19:49,333 --> 01:19:50,416
…keep facing forward.

1431
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:55,500
And if you ever get condemned
for murder again, you give me a shout.

1432
01:19:56,666 --> 01:19:57,500
I will.

1433
01:20:02,125 --> 01:20:03,208
Thank you, Edith.

1434
01:20:08,416 --> 01:20:09,250
Be careful.

1435
01:20:09,333 --> 01:20:11,333

[exhales softly]

1438
01:20:25,291 --> 01:20:26,666
[Eudoria] And get a haircut.

1439
01:20:26,750 --> 01:20:27,875
It's a mess.

1440
01:20:30,375 --> 01:20:31,750
I think my hair is fine.

[gentle music continues]

1442
01:20:45,083 --> 01:20:46,250
Come on.

[gentle music fades]

1444
01:20:51,208 --> 01:20:52,833
[Enola] I need you to pack your things.

1445
01:20:52,916 --> 01:20:55,125
I need you to be in a safer place.

1446
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:57,833
Is… Is my sister gone?

1447
01:20:57,916 --> 01:20:59,500
-Like Mae?
-No.

1448

-[Bessie] Is she--
-No.

1449
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,333
I'm sure she's all right.

1450
01:21:02,416 --> 01:21:04,333
I'm closer to finding her.

1451

Doris,

1452
01:21:08,583 --> 01:21:09,666
she'll take me in.

1453
01:21:10,291 --> 01:21:12,000
She's got a spare bed now.

1454

1460
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:38,416
There's traces of something in this soil.

1461

One has red, and one has white in it.

[sinister music continues]

1463
01:21:46,416 --> 01:21:50,166
The matches you make,
when did they change from red to white?

1464
01:21:50,250 --> 01:21:52,625
I dunno. Around two years ago.

1465
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:58,541
In two years, he's turned red into black.
Or should I say red into white?

[Mr. Lyon] Typhus.
The plague of our times.

1467

1470

Out.

[music fades]

1477
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:01,750
I need your help.

1478
01:23:04,416 --> 01:23:06,166
Don't make me repeat it! May I come in?

1479
01:23:08,208 --> 01:23:11,541
Firstly, I would like to apologize
for so much.

1480
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:14,083
I have failed
to see allies in plain sight.

1481
01:23:14,166 --> 01:23:15,250
-And I have--
-Enola.

1482
01:23:16,250 --> 01:23:17,916
There's something I wish to say too.

1483
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:19,375
-[Enola] All right.
-If you'd just--

1484
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:29,041
All day, every day,
all I do is compromise.

1485
01:23:30,208 --> 01:23:33,416
If I vote for this lord's bill that will
allow him to pump bilge water into a lake,

1486
01:23:33,500 --> 01:23:35,583
then he will vote for my forestry reform.

1487
01:23:35,666 --> 01:23:39,083
I want to stand up and say,
"This isn't right," but I have no allies.

1488
01:23:39,875 --> 01:23:42,500
So to do so
would be to risk all that is good,

1489
01:23:42,583 --> 01:23:45,291
so I lie awake trying to work out
which path to follow,

1490
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:47,000
alone.

1491
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:50,416
There is no search for a wife,

1492
01:23:51,375 --> 01:23:54,708
because politics consumes me constantly.

1493
01:23:57,625 --> 01:23:59,625
That is the speech I stored up for you.

1494
01:24:02,875 --> 01:24:03,875
You're a good man.

1495
01:24:05,166 --> 01:24:06,083
I'm a man now?

1496
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:07,750
On occasion.

1497
01:24:08,416 --> 01:24:11,500
But I understand your struggle,
because I struggle too.

1498
01:24:12,291 --> 01:24:14,250
I am sorry we cannot talk more,
because I have--

1499
01:24:14,333 --> 01:24:16,208
A case to solve?

1501
01:24:23,791 --> 01:24:25,541
she has proof that girls are dying

1502
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:27,958
from the phosphorus
they work with every day.

1503
01:24:28,041 --> 01:24:31,541
And the factory
are trying to cover it up as typhus.

1504
01:24:32,583 --> 01:24:33,541
She knows it,

1505
01:24:34,750 --> 01:24:36,833
and someone is going to kill her for it.

1506
01:24:36,916 --> 01:24:38,000
Then what can we do?

1507
01:24:40,333 --> 01:24:41,166
We?

-Don't open it. it could be the police.
-You're still wanted by the police?

1510
01:24:50,416 --> 01:24:52,583
-Of course. I escaped jail.
-You escaped?

1511

-[Tewkesbury] Coming.

-Miss Cicely.
-[Cicely] I'm sorry it's so late.

1516
01:25:04,708 --> 01:25:08,375
No, no, not at all.
I-I told you to come. I-I want to help.

1517
01:25:08,458 --> 01:25:10,625
-[Cicely] Is anyone else here?
-[Tewkesbury] No.

1518
01:25:10,708 --> 01:25:11,958
-Um--
-[Cicely] Good.

1519
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,458
Better we are alone, for it is imperative
that I speak with you.

1520
01:25:15,958 --> 01:25:18,541
Sir, I feel that you're a man
of great character

1521
01:25:18,625 --> 01:25:19,750
and that I can trust you.

1522
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:23,750
Which is why I fear I may have to unburden
myself, and it may prove shocking.

1523
01:25:23,833 --> 01:25:24,916
[Tewkesbury] Miss Cicely--

1524
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,041
It's just, I've been wanting
to speak with you about… a relationship.

1525
01:25:29,125 --> 01:25:32,416
Oh, that. Yes. Uh, perhaps
we can discuss this another time?

1526
01:25:33,458 --> 01:25:34,291
[Cicely] Please, sir.

1527
01:25:34,375 --> 01:25:37,750
I'm terribly sorry. Let me assure you,
I do share your interest.

1528
01:25:37,833 --> 01:25:40,291
-We will talk again.
-[Cicely] Thank you.

1529
01:25:40,375 --> 01:25:41,458
[door closes]

1530
01:25:43,291 --> 01:25:45,625
She's gone. She was flustered.

1531
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:51,291
Do not think of doubting me.
Cicely was here for my help.

1532
01:25:51,875 --> 01:25:55,000
She told me at the ball that she's working
on a bill to change factory law.

1533
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:58,833
She's unearthed something,
some corruption or other.

1534
01:25:59,458 --> 01:26:00,708
She's doing what?

1535
01:26:00,791 --> 01:26:02,250
[intriguing music plays]

1536
01:26:05,291 --> 01:26:09,125
Enola, if you have any concerns,
I tell you categorically, I…

1537
01:26:09,208 --> 01:26:10,875
I have no eyes for anyone, but…

1538
01:26:12,541 --> 01:26:14,666
Well, no, this is not
quite how I wanted to say that.

1539
01:26:15,708 --> 01:26:18,583
But to say,
in terms of romantic interests,

1540
01:26:19,083 --> 01:26:21,250
yes, my interest is…

1541
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:24,458
The reason I don't have to search,
I'm busy with politics, like I said…

1542
01:26:24,541 --> 01:26:25,958
[Cicely] You admire Lord Tewkesbury?

1543
01:26:26,041 --> 01:26:28,666
I hear he is a good man
and a great reformer.

1544
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,125
The woman I would be most interested in--

1545
01:26:31,208 --> 01:26:32,583
I mustn't lose my chance.

You're not listening.

Good evening, Lord Tewkesbury.

to tell me why you're here.

has mixed with oxygen.

I have missed everything.

Enola, did you understand what I said?

Or rather what I didn't say?
Did you understand… what I didn't say?

1564

Yes. You were saying that you…

[Tewkesbury] You'll learn.

That message
you sent me with the fan at the ball,

1568
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:41,833
what did it mean?

01:27:45,666 --> 01:27:46,708
It means I love you.

Of course.

1573
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,333
They were working together, in love.

1574
01:28:09,458 --> 01:28:10,833
They had a plan.

1575
01:28:12,208 --> 01:28:16,583
To expose the corruption in that factory
and stop what his father was doing.

1576
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:18,625
They wanted your help.

1577
01:28:18,708 --> 01:28:20,833
William Lyon invited you to that ball.

1578
01:28:20,916 --> 01:28:22,458
He's a radical just like you.

1579
01:28:23,125 --> 01:28:25,166
They needed my help. You're right.

1580
01:28:25,958 --> 01:28:27,750
But, Enola, we must return inside.

1581
01:28:27,833 --> 01:28:30,166
The police are pursuing you,
and we have much to talk of.

1582
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,916
No! I know we have much to talk of,
my dear, dear lord.

1583
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:34,125
You love me.

1584
01:28:34,208 --> 01:28:36,250
And as it turns out, I love you too.

1585
01:28:36,333 --> 01:28:37,500
[soft music continues]

1586
01:28:37,583 --> 01:28:38,583
You love me too?

1587
01:28:41,041 --> 01:28:42,833
You really are a nincompoop.

1588
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:45,833
Now hail a cab.

1589
01:28:46,458 --> 01:28:48,458
[bell tolls]

1590
01:28:49,708 --> 01:28:51,708
[footsteps crunching on gravel]

1591
01:28:57,083 --> 01:29:00,875
-[Enola] Shh. You're walking loudly.
-[Tewkesbury] But it's gravel.

1592
01:29:00,958 --> 01:29:02,958
-[Enola] You've got large feet.
-[Tewkesbury] I know.

1593
01:29:06,541 --> 01:29:08,208
[bell continues tolling]

1594
01:29:08,291 --> 01:29:10,541
[grunts] Wait here. Keep guard.

1595
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:12,916
If anyone comes,
just tell them you're a lord.

1596
01:29:13,708 --> 01:29:14,583
I am a lord.

1597
01:29:15,291 --> 01:29:16,916
Then they'll likely believe you.

1598
01:29:17,583 --> 01:29:18,416
All right.

1599
01:29:20,291 --> 01:29:21,583
[tense music plays]

1600
01:29:31,458 --> 01:29:33,458
[liquid bubbling]

1601
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:43,666
[loud clang]

1602
01:29:52,666 --> 01:29:55,250
[suspenseful music playing softly]

1603
01:29:59,958 --> 01:30:01,916
[Enola grunts]

1604
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:03,875
[grunting]

1605
01:30:03,958 --> 01:30:05,000
[Enola yells]

1606
01:30:09,833 --> 01:30:11,041
[Sherlock and Enola] You.

1607
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:12,958
[tool clatters]

1608
01:30:13,458 --> 01:30:15,750
-How ridiculous you are.
-[Sherlock] I'm ridiculous?

1609
01:30:15,833 --> 01:30:18,000
I told you to stay safe and stay away.

1610
01:30:18,083 --> 01:30:20,791
Now you're breaking out of prison
and have the police after you.

1611
01:30:21,291 --> 01:30:24,125
Oh. Are you hurt? I am sorry.

1612
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:25,666
Are you not hurt?

1613
01:30:27,208 --> 01:30:28,208
It seems not.

1614
01:30:29,125 --> 01:30:29,958
Hm.

1615
01:30:30,458 --> 01:30:32,583
I wonder who taught you
to fight like that.

1616
01:30:33,333 --> 01:30:35,083
Another thing our mother
has to answer for.

1617
01:30:35,166 --> 01:30:37,583
She should have fed me as well as you
is what I think.

1618
01:30:38,625 --> 01:30:41,458
Hang on. Why are you here?
Is it my case, or your own?

1619
01:30:42,041 --> 01:30:45,416
Both. I know how Grail
got your fingerprints.

1620
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,416
Oxidized phosphorus dust

1621
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:50,708
lifted from the table
and applied to the knife.

1622
01:30:51,791 --> 01:30:52,625
You're innocent.

1623
01:30:53,916 --> 01:30:55,041
You doubted it?

1624
01:30:55,791 --> 01:30:57,541
Nothing's certain till it's proved.

1625
01:30:59,416 --> 01:31:00,500
And your case?

1626
01:31:01,000 --> 01:31:03,166
[Sherlock] My adversary, his trail,

1627
01:31:03,791 --> 01:31:04,916
it leads here.

1628
01:31:06,875 --> 01:31:08,833
It seems our cases are connected.

1629
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:11,958
Shall we?

1630
01:31:12,041 --> 01:31:14,708
[intense music plays darkly]

1631
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:45,416
William Lyon.

1632
01:31:46,875 --> 01:31:48,416
Sarah's love.

1633
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,791
And my thief in a taper crown hat.

1634
01:31:57,458 --> 01:32:01,000
Stay unemotional. There's nothing more
we can do for him now.

1635
01:32:01,708 --> 01:32:04,375
Need to keep our minds fresh
and our eyes sharp.

1636
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:06,250
[Enola] He was seized.

1637
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:10,500
-[Sherlock] Yes, and searched.
-[Enola] For the document he took?

1638
01:32:11,833 --> 01:32:12,666
A knife?

1639
01:32:13,250 --> 01:32:14,250
No, bigger.

1640
01:32:15,833 --> 01:32:16,791
A cutlass.

1641
01:32:18,916 --> 01:32:20,208
Heavy boot scuffs,

1642
01:32:21,625 --> 01:32:24,208
and scratch marks from a cane
that has a metal ferrule.

1643
01:32:24,291 --> 01:32:25,166
[metal clangs]

1644
01:32:26,083 --> 01:32:27,250
Grail.

1645
01:32:28,291 --> 01:32:29,791
But at whose behest?

1646
01:32:30,916 --> 01:32:32,666
There was another in this room.

1647
01:32:32,750 --> 01:32:34,333
This cigar had a holder.

1648
01:32:34,416 --> 01:32:36,083
[intense music continues]

1649
01:32:38,041 --> 01:32:39,708
And traces of wool.

1650
01:32:42,083 --> 01:32:44,625
[Sherlock] Astrakhan, the finest.

1651
01:32:44,708 --> 01:32:49,083
[Mr. Lyon] Well, Lord McIntyre,
if I, um, might suggest a little lunch.

1652
01:32:50,416 --> 01:32:53,166
[William] Leave me be, please.
They're watching.

1653
01:32:56,583 --> 01:32:58,041
Where did William steal from?

1654
01:32:58,541 --> 01:33:00,583
-The Treasury Office?
-Yes.

1655
01:33:00,666 --> 01:33:03,333
The office of Lord McIntyre,
Treasury Minister.

1656
01:33:03,916 --> 01:33:05,166
How did you come to that?

1657
01:33:06,375 --> 01:33:08,500
I think what William stole was proof

1658
01:33:08,583 --> 01:33:11,500
that Lyon and McIntyre
were conspiring together.

1659
01:33:12,583 --> 01:33:14,208
-Corruption.
-[Enola] Yes.

1660
01:33:14,291 --> 01:33:16,041
Fueled by greed.

1661
01:33:16,708 --> 01:33:20,083
McIntyre has been secretly profiting
from the factory.

1662
01:33:20,166 --> 01:33:23,041
They changed the match formula
to a cheaper phosphorus,

1663
01:33:24,541 --> 01:33:25,708
and it's deadly.

1664
01:33:26,333 --> 01:33:27,208
[Tewkesbury] Enola?

1665
01:33:27,291 --> 01:33:28,833
Enola, I was concerned for you.

1666
01:33:28,916 --> 01:33:31,708
You left me out there in the dark,
and I nearly tore my…

1667
01:33:35,208 --> 01:33:37,125
-Sherlock Holmes? How do--
-Not the time.

1668
01:33:39,416 --> 01:33:40,291
Oh my…

1669
01:33:41,666 --> 01:33:43,000
-Is he--
-Stay unemotional.

1670
01:33:44,833 --> 01:33:47,166
-[Tewkesbury] Who did this?
-Lord McIntyre.

1671
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:49,791
-No.
-But it all fits.

1672
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:53,083
No one has sat in this chair.
No marks on the carpet, no indentation.

1673
01:33:53,166 --> 01:33:56,291
The cigar has been smoked, but cold.

1674
01:33:57,125 --> 01:33:59,625
And look, no ash.

1675
01:34:01,875 --> 01:34:04,541
-No lips have touched that glass.
-[Sherlock] Exactly.

1676
01:34:04,625 --> 01:34:07,125
These clues
have been planted for us to find,

1677
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,250
to mislead us from the true villain.

1678
01:34:10,250 --> 01:34:11,500
This has all been staged.

1679
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:14,083
By who?

1680
01:34:14,833 --> 01:34:18,958
Not McIntyre, but by someone who had
a lot to lose without that document.

1681
01:34:19,041 --> 01:34:22,000
Someone who knew what they were up to
and was blackmailing them.

1682
01:34:23,375 --> 01:34:24,375
My opponent.

1683
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:28,875
Someone who likes a game.

1684
01:34:30,833 --> 01:34:34,083
-Did they get what they wanted?
-[Sherlock] No, I don't think so.

1685
01:34:36,958 --> 01:34:37,833
Poor William.

1687
01:34:47,708 --> 01:34:48,541
[Tewkesbury] Hm.

1688

-[Enola] They did get something.
-[Sherlock] Mae's terrible music.

"The Truth of the Gods."

1690
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,750
Could be biblical, mythical.

1691
01:35:02,833 --> 01:35:03,708
Theatrical?

1692
01:35:07,416 --> 01:35:10,166
The Gods is the top row of the theater.

1693
01:35:10,833 --> 01:35:11,708
The balcony.

1694
01:35:12,916 --> 01:35:14,125
Doesn't everyone know that?

[dramatic music plays]

1696
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:17,208
This isn't music.

[horse whinnies]

1702
01:35:36,958 --> 01:35:39,625
Just to be clear
as to what we might be about to face…

1703
01:35:40,958 --> 01:35:43,541
There may be some violence.
You've faced it before.

1704
01:35:44,458 --> 01:35:45,333
Yes.

1705
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:47,791
I did have part of a suit of armor on.

1706
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:51,416
But yes, fighting will be… [chuckles]

1707
01:35:52,458 --> 01:35:53,291
Yes.

1708
01:35:53,375 --> 01:35:55,750
-You've been in a fight before?
-Yes, plenty of fights.

1709

Fenced for my school.

1710
01:35:57,875 --> 01:35:58,708
[Enola] Mm.

1711
01:36:02,458 --> 01:36:04,458
Fine. Can you teach me to fight?

1712
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:07,833
What, right now? In a carriage?

1713
01:36:07,916 --> 01:36:10,916
Did I not teach you to dance
in five minutes in a bathroom?

1714
01:36:12,083 --> 01:36:14,166
All right. Fine.

1715
01:36:18,166 --> 01:36:21,750
There are two secrets to fighting.
Avoid the punch, make the counterpunch.

[humorous music playing]

1717
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:24,916
I don't see how two secrets-- Ow!

01:36:27,458 --> 01:36:28,291
Ow.

1720
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:30,375
Ow!

1721
01:36:30,458 --> 01:36:32,583
Your second. You didn't avoid the punch.

1722
01:36:32,666 --> 01:36:35,833
-You can hardly expect me to hit a girl.
-Oh dear.

1723
01:36:35,916 --> 01:36:36,750
I'm not some-- Ow!

1724
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:38,958
Ow! Will you stop that?

1725
01:36:39,458 --> 01:36:41,000
[laughing] I can't stop.

[mysterious music playing]

1735
01:37:59,791 --> 01:38:00,791
[Enola] Sarah.

1736
01:38:03,583 --> 01:38:04,458
It's all there.

1737
01:38:06,250 --> 01:38:07,750
All the proof we need.

1738
01:38:09,458 --> 01:38:12,666
[Enola] The contract
between Lyon and McIntyre

1739
01:38:13,541 --> 01:38:15,083
to change the phosphorus.

1740
01:38:17,375 --> 01:38:19,000
What William stole for you.

1741
01:38:24,166 --> 01:38:27,541
And the pages from the factory register.

1742
01:38:27,625 --> 01:38:29,750
That's what you stole from the office.

1743
01:38:31,125 --> 01:38:33,333
These are the names
of the girls they killed.

1744
01:38:33,416 --> 01:38:35,208
[Sarah] I couldn't let 'em be forgotten.

1745
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:40,958
And it's proof that match girls
are dying from working in that factory,

1746
01:38:41,458 --> 01:38:42,833
and they knew it all along.

1747
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:47,291
You're a bloody good detective,
Enola Holmes.

[inhales deeply]

1749

You are too, Sarah Chapman.

Now we must find William.
He was supposed to meet me six hours ago.

[somber music continues]

1760
01:39:30,041 --> 01:39:32,000
I told him we had everything we needed.

1761
01:39:33,250 --> 01:39:34,750
That we should just go public.

1762
01:39:37,625 --> 01:39:41,583
He said nobody would care unless we had
someone in power who would listen.

1763
01:39:44,458 --> 01:39:46,583
He was just trying to keep me safe.

1764

And now I've lost him.

1765
01:39:50,791 --> 01:39:53,000
We must move quickly,
or we'll lose you too.

01:48:58,125 --> 01:48:59,166
Moriarty.

1930
01:48:59,250 --> 01:49:01,250
[sinister music plays]

1931
01:49:06,291 --> 01:49:10,833
Such a shame our divertissement
has to end, Mr. Holmes.

1932
01:49:12,083 --> 01:49:16,208
I was so enjoying it.

1933
01:49:17,791 --> 01:49:20,416
And you, Enola. [chuckles]

1934
01:49:21,500 --> 01:49:24,458
Miss Troy, you have been behind this?

1935
01:49:25,916 --> 01:49:29,333
Of course, you never can find
the proper staff.

1936
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:31,750
I only wanted the agreements back.

1937
01:49:32,708 --> 01:49:35,333
Though I couldn't be seen
to question William myself,

1938
01:49:35,416 --> 01:49:37,291
you were so obliging.

1939
01:49:39,083 --> 01:49:43,166
If you wish to speak with William,
you could always try with that.

1940
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:46,125
[sinister music continues]

1941
01:49:46,875 --> 01:49:51,041
[Miss Troy] Just a pity he was smarter
and braver in the end than I'd expected.

1942
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:55,666
They both were.
Their deaths were so unnecessary.

1943
01:49:56,291 --> 01:50:02,958
But Superintendent Grail
was somewhat of a blunt instrument.

1944
01:50:03,541 --> 01:50:04,958
[McIntyre] You!

1945
01:50:05,041 --> 01:50:07,875
How dare you take advantage
of your position!

1946
01:50:10,833 --> 01:50:13,166
I take advantage?

1947
01:50:14,875 --> 01:50:17,583
What were my advantages?

1948
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:22,833
Treated like a common servant
when I have twice the mind of yours.

1949
01:50:24,958 --> 01:50:26,416
Any of yours.

1950
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:32,625
Why shouldn't I have a share
of your ill-begotten riches

1951
01:50:32,708 --> 01:50:35,125
and punish you at the same time?

1952
01:50:36,208 --> 01:50:39,458
Why shouldn't I be rewarded
for what I can do?

1953
01:50:40,791 --> 01:50:46,041
Where is my place in this… society?

1954
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:48,416
I am a woman.

1955
01:50:49,000 --> 01:50:50,833
I cannot join clubs,

1956
01:50:51,500 --> 01:50:52,583
I cannot own shares,

1957
01:50:52,666 --> 01:50:55,583
I cannot advance myself as they can.

1958
01:50:56,791 --> 01:50:57,625
So…

1959
01:51:00,416 --> 01:51:03,000
I found my own way.

1960
01:51:05,375 --> 01:51:10,125
[inhales] And it was fun.

1961
01:51:10,208 --> 01:51:11,666
[sinister music plays]

1962
01:51:11,750 --> 01:51:12,666
[chuckles]

1963
01:51:14,500 --> 01:51:15,833
Lestrade,

1964
01:51:17,666 --> 01:51:19,666
take her away.

1965
01:51:19,750 --> 01:51:20,583
Yes, sir.

1966
01:51:23,041 --> 01:51:24,041
On what charge, sir?

1967
01:51:24,958 --> 01:51:26,833
-Extortion.
-Uh, yes, yes.

1968
01:51:26,916 --> 01:51:27,875
Blackmail, murder.

1969
01:51:28,750 --> 01:51:29,583
Go.

1970
01:51:30,083 --> 01:51:33,708
Such a shame our little dance has to end.

1971
01:51:35,041 --> 01:51:36,666
For now at least.

1972
01:51:36,750 --> 01:51:38,833
Perhaps we shall take to the floor again.

1973
01:51:44,208 --> 01:51:45,208
[exhales]

1974
01:51:47,083 --> 01:51:48,083
No!

1975
01:51:48,791 --> 01:51:50,208
No!

1976
01:51:52,041 --> 01:51:54,250
[McIntyre] Well, there. That's that then.

1977
01:51:56,166 --> 01:51:59,166
I accidentally burnt my own property.
What of it?

1978
01:52:00,458 --> 01:52:03,041
You are corrupt, sir.

1979
01:52:03,125 --> 01:52:05,833
And complicit in the deaths
of hundreds of match girls.

1980
01:52:07,208 --> 01:52:08,500
Where is your proof?

1981
01:52:08,583 --> 01:52:10,166
[haunting music plays]

1982
01:52:10,250 --> 01:52:11,291
[McIntyre] Good.

1983
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:14,958
So… back to business.

1984
01:52:16,291 --> 01:52:18,166
-Sir, you cannot--
-Tewkesbury.

1985
01:52:18,250 --> 01:52:19,750
[haunting music continues]

1986
01:52:20,875 --> 01:52:21,708
Patience.

1987
01:52:28,833 --> 01:52:29,833
Glory be.

1988
01:52:29,916 --> 01:52:33,291
[haunting music continues]

1989
01:52:39,166 --> 01:52:40,500
[haunting music fades]

1990
01:52:41,916 --> 01:52:44,833
[Sarah] All those names, those lives,

1991
01:52:45,833 --> 01:52:46,916
I failed 'em, Enola.

1992
01:52:47,583 --> 01:52:48,708
Don't say that.

1993
01:52:50,458 --> 01:52:51,333
Mae gone…

1994
01:52:54,375 --> 01:52:55,250
William gone,

1995
01:52:56,791 --> 01:52:58,541
and they're gonna get away with it.

1996
01:52:59,750 --> 01:53:01,750
You heard the man. "Where's your proof?"

1997
01:53:03,291 --> 01:53:04,291
What do we have now?

1998
01:53:09,166 --> 01:53:10,375
We have each other…

1999
01:53:13,583 --> 01:53:15,166
and we have the truth.

2000
01:53:22,375 --> 01:53:24,208
[liquid bubbling]

2001
01:53:27,041 --> 01:53:29,875
You're late, Bess Chapman.
Docking you a penny.

2002
01:53:32,625 --> 01:53:33,541
Oi.

2003
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:36,625
You're not welcome here no more.

2004
01:53:38,208 --> 01:53:40,125
What are you doing? Oi!

2005
01:53:40,708 --> 01:53:41,541
Get down.

2006
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,541
[yelling] Get down!

2007
01:53:44,041 --> 01:53:45,750
Let her speak!

2008
01:53:49,833 --> 01:53:51,041
[Sarah] A few weeks ago,

2009
01:53:52,750 --> 01:53:55,666
Mae Izley, William Lyon, and I

2010
01:53:55,750 --> 01:53:57,375
set out to prove something.

2011
01:53:59,041 --> 01:54:01,333
To prove that this factory
was killing people,

2012
01:54:02,791 --> 01:54:03,958
and they knew it.

2013
01:54:04,041 --> 01:54:07,458
But they decided that profit
mattered more than we did.

2014
01:54:08,916 --> 01:54:11,166
-You're coming with me.
-[Enola] Shh!

2015
01:54:11,250 --> 01:54:14,333
It ain't typhus that's killing us.
It's the phosphorus.

2016
01:54:15,041 --> 01:54:16,750
What we work with every day.

2017
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:19,750
You lying little toerag.

2018
01:54:19,833 --> 01:54:21,375
That's a penny off your wages!

2019
01:54:21,458 --> 01:54:22,375
[whip snaps]

2020
01:54:23,750 --> 01:54:25,083
These were our friends…

2021
01:54:27,416 --> 01:54:28,500
our sisters…

2022
01:54:33,791 --> 01:54:35,083
and our children.

2023
01:54:36,875 --> 01:54:39,291
Well, it stops now.

2024
01:54:39,375 --> 01:54:41,375
[pensive music playing]

2025
01:54:41,458 --> 01:54:44,625
It's time for us to use
the only thing we have. Ourselves.

2026
01:54:45,500 --> 01:54:49,250
It's time for us to refuse to work.

2027
01:54:49,333 --> 01:54:51,000
It's time to tell 'em no.

2028
01:54:51,791 --> 01:54:53,666
-Right, get back to work.
-[Enola] No!

2029
01:54:55,208 --> 01:54:57,625
You leave here, there is no coming back.

2030
01:54:59,125 --> 01:55:01,375
You will not get employed here again.

2031
01:55:02,875 --> 01:55:05,958
Well, will you join me?

2032
01:55:09,541 --> 01:55:11,000
[Crouch] Think of your families.

2033
01:55:11,833 --> 01:55:13,125
Don't do it, girls.

2034
01:55:13,208 --> 01:55:15,666
It is not worth the risk.

2035
01:55:16,375 --> 01:55:17,208
[Sarah] Well,

2036
01:55:18,916 --> 01:55:19,791
will ya?

2037
01:55:20,375 --> 01:55:22,416
[Crouch] This is how the world works.

2038
01:55:23,625 --> 01:55:24,458
Please, girls.

2039
01:55:24,541 --> 01:55:26,250
[pensive music continues]

2040
01:55:26,333 --> 01:55:28,541
I know you're scared. I am too.

2041
01:55:28,625 --> 01:55:30,333
But it's the only power we have!

2042
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:34,458
[Crouch scoffs]

2043
01:55:37,791 --> 01:55:38,625
[Crouch] Right,

2044
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:42,916
get that machine back on
and get back to work.

2045
01:55:43,000 --> 01:55:44,500
[pensive music continues]

2046
01:55:49,833 --> 01:55:50,666
[Sarah] Right.

2047
01:55:54,166 --> 01:55:55,000
[Enola] No.

2048
01:55:56,500 --> 01:55:58,000
This can't be their future.

2049
01:55:59,208 --> 01:56:00,166
I'm sorry, Enola.

2050
01:56:00,250 --> 01:56:02,291
[pensive music fades]

-[foot stomps]
-[Crouch] Stop that.

2055
01:56:19,083 --> 01:56:20,750
-[foot stomps]

2057
01:56:24,916 --> 01:56:25,875
[foot stomps]

2058
01:56:25,958 --> 01:56:27,250
Be one voice.

[foot stomps]

-[feet stomp in unison]
-That's enough!

[feet rhythmically stamp]

2063
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:46,916
Stop that!

2064
01:56:47,541 --> 01:56:49,875
[stomping grows louder]

2065
01:56:50,666 --> 01:56:52,541

[rhythmic stomping continues]

2067
01:56:57,500 --> 01:56:59,541
Can't anyone control these bloody women?

[stomping continues]

[stomping quickens]

2071
01:57:06,083 --> 01:57:07,083
Come on, girls.

2072
01:57:07,166 --> 01:57:09,875
[inspiring music swells]

2073
01:57:09,958 --> 01:57:12,208
[women chattering indistinctly]

01:57:12,291 --> 01:57:15,041
[inspiring music continues joyously]

2075
01:57:44,916 --> 01:57:47,375
-[man] Where are you going?
-[Bessie] Westminster!

2076
01:57:50,083 --> 01:57:51,000
There they go.

2077
01:57:52,041 --> 01:57:53,500
That's a whole lot of noise.

2078
01:57:54,958 --> 01:57:56,916
She likes causing trouble, doesn't she?

2079
01:57:57,500 --> 01:57:59,958
It's as if she was molded that way.

2080
01:58:03,333 --> 01:58:04,916
She still needs that haircut.

2081
01:58:06,416 --> 01:58:08,416
[inspiring music fades]

2082
01:58:15,083 --> 01:58:17,458
Seems your boy has learned how to fight.

2083
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:20,916
[Lestrade] Lord McIntyre.

2084
01:58:23,208 --> 01:58:24,208
[handcuffs click]

2085
01:58:25,333 --> 01:58:26,166
Indeed.

2086
01:58:27,375 --> 01:58:28,291
He's not my boy.

2087
01:58:33,250 --> 01:58:34,083
[Sherlock chuckles]

2088
01:58:35,083 --> 01:58:36,583
[Sherlock] "Pay what you can."

2089
01:58:37,291 --> 01:58:39,916
And what will people pay you in?
Potatoes and gratitude?

2090
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,333
If that's all they have.

2091
01:58:41,416 --> 01:58:44,541
You can deal with the hoits and toits.
This is where I should be.

2092
01:58:45,125 --> 01:58:47,125
Edith said she'll be kind with the rent.

2093
01:58:48,750 --> 01:58:54,291
You know, you are aware, should you wish
some finer surrounds, I could, uh…

2094
01:58:54,375 --> 01:58:55,208
[clicks tongue]

2095
01:58:56,416 --> 01:58:57,291
I was thinking…

2096
01:59:00,250 --> 01:59:01,416
Holmes and Holmes?

2097
01:59:04,250 --> 01:59:05,083
A partnership?

2098
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,958
[heartwarming music plays softly]

2099
01:59:09,041 --> 01:59:11,041
That is the kindest offer.

2100
01:59:12,333 --> 01:59:15,458
But if I did that,
I would always be in your shadow.

2101
01:59:16,250 --> 01:59:17,458
Hm. Yes.

2102
01:59:21,833 --> 01:59:24,083
Though I do like this new version of you.

2103
01:59:24,875 --> 01:59:26,708
No one should be alone all the time.

2104
01:59:28,083 --> 01:59:29,375
A friend would do you well.

2105
01:59:31,875 --> 01:59:33,541
Perhaps I should write that down.

2106
01:59:37,500 --> 01:59:39,375
I shall drop by to check on you.

2107
01:59:40,041 --> 01:59:41,125
I would like that.

2108
01:59:41,916 --> 01:59:45,125
Perhaps you could come to Baker Street
from time to time…

2109
01:59:47,208 --> 01:59:48,208
to check on me.

2110
01:59:52,416 --> 01:59:56,000
Perhaps we can fix on Thursday, 4 p.m.

2111
01:59:56,916 --> 01:59:58,166
Thursday at 4:00 it is.

2112
02:00:00,666 --> 02:00:03,416
It seems I shan't be the last
to interrupt you today.

2113
02:00:05,625 --> 02:00:06,625
And he has flowers.

2114
02:00:07,791 --> 02:00:08,833
[Enola chuckles awkwardly]

2115
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:11,666
-[Tewkesbury] Sherlock.
-Tewkesbury.

2116
02:00:11,750 --> 02:00:14,041
-See you on Thursday.
-[Tewkesbury] Bye, Sherlock.

2117
02:00:15,541 --> 02:00:16,375
[Enola giggles]

2118
02:00:19,750 --> 02:00:20,583
[Edith clears throat]

2119
02:00:23,208 --> 02:00:24,375
-[Edith] Sherlock?
-Yes.

2120
02:00:24,458 --> 02:00:25,375
Your paper.

2121
02:00:26,250 --> 02:00:27,083
Thank you.

2122
02:00:27,666 --> 02:00:28,500
And…

2123
02:00:30,125 --> 02:00:32,666
thank you… for everything.

2124
02:00:38,458 --> 02:00:39,291
[clears throat]

2125
02:00:39,916 --> 02:00:42,125
[intriguing music playing]

2126
02:00:49,875 --> 02:00:51,625
[newspaper rustles]

2127
02:00:51,708 --> 02:00:54,708
[Enola] Tewkesbury, when did I give you
the impression that I like flowers?

2128
02:00:54,791 --> 02:00:57,458
They're called Spreading Bellflowers.
Wild, of course.

2129
02:00:58,041 --> 02:01:00,791
Attracted to ancient woodland,
wiry, deceptive,

2130
02:01:01,458 --> 02:01:03,458
refuse to behave according to any rules,

2131
02:01:03,541 --> 02:01:07,958
but their petals are so delicate,
and their flowers--

2132
02:01:08,041 --> 02:01:09,000
Two things.

2133
02:01:09,083 --> 02:01:12,041
Your metaphor is tortured,
and I don't have delicate petals.

2134
02:01:12,125 --> 02:01:13,500
[Tewkesbury] Oh, and, and, and…

2135
02:01:14,916 --> 02:01:18,166
It is an invitation to a ball
being given by--

2136
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:22,333
Uh, I am not going to a ball with you.
I got arrested at the last one.

2137
02:01:23,666 --> 02:01:26,875
Well, all the more reason to dance again,
wouldn't you say?

2138
02:01:26,958 --> 02:01:30,083
-[Enola] You're a nincompoop.
-[Tewkesbury] And you are a coward.

2139
02:01:30,166 --> 02:01:33,041
[Enola] How dare you speak to a lady
like that? You are a disgrace, sir.

2140
02:01:33,125 --> 02:01:35,250
[Tewkesbury] And yet
you still hold my arm.

2141
02:01:36,041 --> 02:01:37,958
[Enola] And yet I still hold your arm.

2142
02:01:39,791 --> 02:01:42,250
[uplifting music plays]

2143
02:01:51,666 --> 02:01:54,750
[uplifting music continues triumphantly]

2144
02:02:02,166 --> 02:02:04,500
-[uplifting music stops suddenly]
-[film reel whirring]

2145
02:02:04,583 --> 02:02:05,750
[clock chiming]

2146
02:02:09,041 --> 02:02:11,458
[chiming continues]

2147
02:02:12,166 --> 02:02:13,375
[knocking on door]

2148
02:02:18,250 --> 02:02:19,291
[man] Sherlock Holmes?

2149
02:02:20,166 --> 02:02:21,291
Yes.

2150
02:02:22,166 --> 02:02:23,583
I'm here for my appointment.

2151
02:02:25,458 --> 02:02:26,458
You're seeking a flatmate?

2152
02:02:28,000 --> 02:02:30,125
-You must have the wrong address.
-Really?

2153
02:02:32,958 --> 02:02:35,958
The young lady was very clear
as to the place a-and the time.

2154
02:02:37,208 --> 02:02:39,166
-"Thursday at 4:00," she said.
-[sighs]

2155
02:02:39,250 --> 02:02:41,000
-[man] You are Sherlock Holmes?
-Hm.

2156
02:02:42,708 --> 02:02:43,541
Yes.

2157
02:02:44,791 --> 02:02:46,791
Please, do come in, Mr…?

2158
02:02:46,875 --> 02:02:47,708
Doctor.

2159
02:02:48,791 --> 02:02:49,625
Watson.

2160
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:51,625
John Watson.

2161
02:02:51,708 --> 02:02:57,625
[uplifting music resumes]

2162
02:03:23,083 --> 02:03:25,666
[uplifting music continues]

2163
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:53,541
[uplifting music continues]

2164
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:17,958
[music fades to silence]

2165
02:04:18,041 --> 02:04:18,958
{\an8}[explosion]

2166
02:04:19,041 --> 02:04:21,500
{\an8}[thrilling orchestral music playing]

2167
02:05:48,458 --> 02:05:52,125
[thrilling music intensifies]

2168
02:06:27,041 --> 02:06:29,041
[thrilling music fades]

2169
02:06:36,583 --> 02:06:41,666
[gentle instrumental music playing]

2170
02:07:34,333 --> 02:07:39,250
[gentle music continues]

2171
02:08:45,250 --> 02:08:47,250
[music fades to silence]
