00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I come here to day, I'd like you to help me check.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Who do you want me to check?

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.000
Jiu. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Sure, big brother.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.000
I will prove you

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000
how honest I am to you.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.000
Yang. Don't tell me that

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
Pin asked to cancel the wedding today because of you two.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.000
Please go back first. Let us consult and then we'll talk later. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
After Tian and Lady Pin consume the cicada orchids, 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
they will be so fascinated that they want to possess each other.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.000
If she sleeps with Tian already, will she still refuse to marry him?

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000
They lured us to be locked up here. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You know that Father is not here.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Why do you call Pin and Prince Pat to come here today?

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.000
Let's discuss and conclude today. 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.000
Mr. Song is going out for work today.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.000
Please stay here and wait until he comes back.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I will put the color on the teacup.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Red one will be coated with a drug that makes you feel exhausted.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Give this to Prince Pat.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So we can buy time to let Prince Pat and Pin stay here longer.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
The yellow one

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
will be coated with cicada orchid powder. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
After drinking this tea, 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
The arousal drug will take full effect after two hours.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.000
It would be the right time when Mr. Song comes back. 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Pin, why don't you drink tea?

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You should drink Oolong tea while it's still hot.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Okay. 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.000
Sir, are you okay?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
I don't know, it's like I don't have any strength.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Are you sick?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Jia, go prepare the room, so Prince Phat can have some rest.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Have some rest. 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
When Mr. Song comes back, you must be better by then.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.000
It's okay, Aunt Li. 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
We'd better go back. We can reschedule this for another day.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
Let the prince rest for a while, he's sick.

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.000
If he gets up now, he might feel dizzy.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Please have a drink, Pin. You'll calm down.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Have a sip. 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Alright. 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Father.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Father.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Father.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Aunt Li, I didn't bring my car here. 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.000
Could you take Father to the doctor for me?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Oh, dear. I also let the driver take the car out to run errands outside as well.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.000
Now there are no cars left at home. 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:53.000
So please take care of my father for a while, I'll call a taxi.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I'll go with you

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:57.000
It's okay. I'll do it myself. 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000
Tian.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000
I think...

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.000
It's fine. I'll call a taxi.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.000
Jia. 

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000
Pin. 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
I think Prince Pat's condition is not that severe.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000
You'd better take care of him here.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000
It's okay. I'd better go out call a taxi.

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.000
Pin, Pin. 

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:27.000
I’ll let the servant call taxi for you. Don’t go by yourself. 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:29.000
It's hot outside. 

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
It's okay. Let me go, please. 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.000
I'm sorry. / Pin.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Did it open?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
How is it, Sir?

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000
When will they lock us here?

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.000
What are they planning to do?

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Yang. 

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000
What's wrong?

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000
What do you want?

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Be careful.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Help me, help me.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.000
What's that sound?

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Help me, help.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.000
It's Pin's voice. What happened?

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:03.000
Help me.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Help!

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Yang. Watch out.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.000
Help me!

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Help! Is anybody here? Help me!

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Help me, help.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000
Tian. 

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Baby. 

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Mother. 

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Sir. 

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Where is Pin now?

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000
I'll look for her. 

00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:03.000
Tian, Tian. 

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000
Mother, I don't know what's wrong with me?

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000
I feel like it's hot inside.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
I think you're not feeling well. Go have some rest.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Jia and I will take you to your room. 

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Let's go. 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000
What about Prince Pat and Pin?

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Let's go, Sir. 

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.000
But Pin has disappeared for a long time. 

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Don't worry.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
I'm so tired. I can't take it anymore.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Why is the soil so hard?

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
I dug until the hoe almost cracked. 

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000
We can't plant anything on this kind of soil. 

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000
What exactly does Madam Li want to do?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
We don't know. Just do what she orders.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Right, hurry up and finish it. So we can go back.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
She has never forbidden anything all these years. 

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:19.000
But today she orders that if we don't finish or have any necessary business, 

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.000
don't go back to the main building.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000
She's probably afraid that you're slacking around.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000
This is not the way to my room. Where are you going?

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Mother. 

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.000
Stay here first. 

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.000
Luckily, our plan didn't fail. 

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000
It was almost the time Mr. Song comes back.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Once he's here, take him and Prince Pat to see with their own eyes

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
that the two have an affair before marriage. 

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Let's see if Pin will still refuse the marriage.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000
Tian. 

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Tian. 

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Where is this place?

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Tian, why is your body so hot?

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
Your face is very red.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Are you not feeling well?

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Yang, help me first. 

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.000
Quicky, quickly. 

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Yang.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Mom, back away.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Can you open it?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Mom, wait here. I'll go help Pin first. 

00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.000
What? Yang!

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000
And how did you get here?

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000
We have to find a way out.

00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:28.000
Someone attacked me, then brought me here.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Pin. 

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Is anyone outside? We're trapped in here. 

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Help me, help me.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000
We're trapped inside this room.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.000
Tian, Tian.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
I think you'd better lie down. Come on.

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.000
Go to bed. Let's go. 

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Pin! Pin!

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Pin!

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Pin!

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Tian. 

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000
What's wrong with you?

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Tian.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Help me, please. 

00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:03.000
Tian.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Tian.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.000
Jiu. 

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000
I heard you cry, what happened?

00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.000
Someone attacked me and brought me here.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:22.000
So are you alright?

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:26.000
I'm fine. You should check Tian. He's not feeling well.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Oh, why is the body so hot?

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.000
We must take him to the main building immediately. 

00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:36.000
Okay. 

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Why are you bleeding like this?

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000
I think you'd better take Lady Pin to fix the wound first.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
She's bleeding a lot. Don't know how big the wound is. 

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
I'll take Tian back by myself.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Then please take care of Tian. 

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Let's go. 

00:17:58.300 --> 00:17:59.000
Yes. 

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Let's go. 

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
Are you okay? 

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Let's go. 

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Let me help.

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000
I think we'd better hurry. Let's go.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
I think you better rest.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Your condition is not good. 

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000
Jiu. 

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
I feel hot. 

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Hot?

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000
Drink water first.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Wait here. I'll get a damp cloth to wipe your face.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Let me go first so I can wipe your face. 

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.000
Jiu. 

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
I like you.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000
I don't know why I'm like this.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000
But I can't restrain myself.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000
I want to tell you.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
I really like you.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000
You can hate me for being this. 

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.000
I never hate you.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Can I love you?

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Zhang, Zhang. 

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Zhang. 

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Tian. 

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
I'm sorry.

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.000
What happened?

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000
I'm a homosexual. 

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000
It can't be true. 

00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Tian. 

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.000
I hope that someday you will experience the pain that I had suffered.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
You will understand how I feel. 

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:07.000
No.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Tian. 

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Sir. 

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000
The picture in my dream became more and more clear every day.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Probably because of Zhang's curse.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000
He wanted me to know his pain.

00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:50.000
I'm scared.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000
In my dream, Tian told me he was a homosexual.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:00.000
It still resonates in my head every day.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.000
It's just a dream, Sir. 

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:11.000
Besides, I've never seen Tian show any kind of affection towards men.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
But he doesn't seem to like women either. 

00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:17.000
I'll ask Pin to marry him, 

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.000
he still doesn't like her.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000
And before this, 

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
he had never been interested in any woman before.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000
So...

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000
If it turns out to be something you're worried…

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:37.900
No way.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.000
No. 

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000
I won't let that happen.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
I will never let my son become a homosexual no matter what.

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Sir, can you force this kind of thing?

00:26:50.500 --> 00:26:54.000
It's individual taste. It depends on what they likes and express themselves. 

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Besides, I personally I think that

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:04.000
Mr. Tian is probably like a normal guy who just hasn't met a woman he truly loves.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
But if it's not like that …

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
If things turned out to be what you are worried about, 

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
it wasn't Mr. Tian's fault.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000
I didn't say it was right or wrong.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
But it was something that no one accepted.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Tian should be big, be the head of the Five Dragons Association. 

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Not a gay. 

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
I don't want to see anyone laugh at him. 

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000
I don't want to see him suffer. 

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000
Don't want anyone to tell me how bad I'm as a father who raises a child to be gay.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Sir, the one who is suffering is the one who does not accept the truth.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
If you control and decide everything

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.000
to be in accordance with what you think is right and wrong, 

00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000
History might repeat itself.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Big Brother.

00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Xiaotong. 

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:14.000
How did you get here?

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000
My staff said that you're here, so I rush to see you. 

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
I got some news about the thing you let me do. 

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:35.000
I let someone to investigate about Jiu according to your order. 

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
I saw that there were many doubts.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
So I want to let you know first.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Jiu has no relatives.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:50.000
He lives with two younger siblings at a rented house in opera house alley around Thewet.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
It's an area where Ma is in charge of.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000
I already know about that, so what's next?

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000
But there are many doubts.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
There were frequent murder cases in that area.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:12.000
I found that all the dead had problems with Ma. 

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.000
For example, the latest case. 

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.000
The murder case of a police officer.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:20.000
After I calculated the time, 

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
the time of the murder, 

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
it was also the time when Ma often went to that alley.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
If two of them know each other, 

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000
we may assume that …

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Jiu is Ma's assassin.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Are you awake?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:11.000
How long have I been asleep?

00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Where is Pin and Tian?

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:19.000
They go for a walk.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Why is the house so quiet?

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Sir, I'll go get some tea for you. 

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Give it to me. 

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Prince Pat. 

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Li, Sir. 

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:56.000
Sir, the prince comes to discuss about the wedding.

00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:57.100
Let's talk about it later.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Where is Tian now?

00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:01.000
Oh, no. 

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000
We got big trouble, Sir, Madam. 

00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.000
What's wrong?

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000
I don't know how to say it. 

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:16.000
Mr. Song, Madam and Prince Pat, please take a look at the small house for yourself.

00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:17.000
This way.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Let's go, Sir. Let's go.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Tian. 

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Tian. 

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Did I...

00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:00.000
What's wrong , Jia? Why are you so shocked?

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000
I can't say it, Madam. Please see it yourself.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Sir. 

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Why...

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
it turns out this way?

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Wait.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Calm down.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000
What's wrong?

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Li.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Li!

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Who's in there?

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Jia, is Tian inside?

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Yes, Sir. Mr. Tian is in there with Lady Pin.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
My daughter. Are you there?

00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:14.000
Pin. 

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.000
Father.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Are you injured?

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000
What happened?

00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.000
Someone attacked Pin. 

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000
I heard she cried, so I followed her quickly. 

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:40.000
Tian and Jiu are inside.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Tian. 

00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.000
Wait, there's no one inside.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.000
Don't go in.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Why won't you open it? Open it.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
If you don't open it, move.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.000
No. 

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.000
Li. 

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Get away.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Why are you stopping me? Open it.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.000
Move. 

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Li, I'll open it myself.

00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.000
No one is here, Sir.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.000
Li. 

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.000
No, Sir. / Li.

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:18.000
Sir. 

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.000
Calm down, Sir. / Get out now.

00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.000
No. 

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:22.000
Li!

00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:23.000
Madam.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:24.000
Madam.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Tian. 

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:28.000
Sir, Sir. 

00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:29.000
Tian. 

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
You see? I told you there was no one here. 

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000
You're fine now. 

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
I'm going to take my daughter to the doctor today.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Let's discuss later. 

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:11.000
I must apologize you both. 

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:20.000
I'm sorry, Sir.

00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.000
I apologize to you, Sir. 

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Sir. 

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Mr. Tian and Jiu aren't home both.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Calm down, Sir. 

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Yang.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.000
What did you see?

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000
I saw Tian and Jiu. 

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Tian seemed like he was dizzy and unwell. 

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000
That's it?

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Yang, did Jiu hurt Tian?

00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.000
No.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Sir. 

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:21.000
Sir. 

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000
Are you back?

00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.000
Yang, where have you been?

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Luckily, a worker walked by, so I could get out.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000
What happened?

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Someone locked me, Nuan and Yang in the barn.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.000
The worker also told me just now that

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Jia ordered all the workers to dig the soil at the back of the farm.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
She also emphasized not to come to the main building.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:57.000
It must be Madam Li who ordered this. 

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.000
What evil plan are you planning next?

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Bao. 

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000
Let all the workers look for Tian and Jiu.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Find them as quickly as possible.

00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:16.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.000
Hurry up. 

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Sir. 

00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:23.000
Tian's gone with a worker. Why is this a big deal?

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000
You should catch Madam Li.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.000
You must have planned to kill someone.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:32.000
Now, the most important thing is to find Tian and Jiu. 

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.000
I rushed back

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.000
because someone told me that Jiu is Ma's subordinate. 

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Did Xiaotong discuss with you about this?

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000
If Jiu is Mr. Ma's subordinate, 

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000
it must be him who did everything that happened today.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000
He was the one who hurt Lady Pin.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.000
But I don't think so

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
because when I went to help Pin, I saw that Jiu was helping them both as well.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000
He might act normal after attacking her.

00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.000
Didn't you hear that he was Mr. Ma's subordinate?

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
He must have been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Jia, you called me to look at something in the room.

00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:31.100
What did you see?

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:38.000
I saw Lady Pin and Mr. Tian,

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
and a stranger in that room.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
So I thought he was a thief, so I called everyone to help.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000
I doubted it was Jiu. 

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000
Wow, you're still able to frame others shamelessly.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
It's the plan of yours and Madam Li. 

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
You are suspicious since Dong's funeral, Chan. 

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000
And if Jiu is Mr. Ma's subordinate, 

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:04.000
it's your plan today. 

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.000
Then explain

00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:10.000
why did you keep all the workers out of the main building?

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.000
Yang already told you just now

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.000
that Tian was also dizzy as well. 

00:40:15.300 --> 00:40:17.000
Do you think that I would hurt my son?

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
My son is gone. 

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Tian. / Madam. 

00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:22.000
Madam. 

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Jia, take Li to rest.

00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:29.000
Yes, Sir. Let's go. 

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Ma. 

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
If you hurt my son, 

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
I won't let you get away. 

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Madam. 

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Jia. 

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Madam. 

00:41:58.000 --> 00:41:59.000
What happened?

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:02.000
What did you see in that room?

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Wasn't Tian there?

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.000
I saw…

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Tian.

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000
It must be because of the effect of the orchids that we gave him.

00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.000
When he met Jiu, 

00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:29.100
so he...

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.000
My Tian.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
I don't know what he will do to him.

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
But now he knows my son's secret.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000
We must hurry to find Jiu

00:42:47.500 --> 00:42:49.000
before he tells Mr. Ma the secret.

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.000
Or else my son will be in big trouble.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Tian.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Tian, wait.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.000
How are you? Still have a headache?

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000
I'm fine. 

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.000
I can take care of myself.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000
Please don't mess with me anymore.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Hey, wait. 

00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Why are you saying this?

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000
You are not just someone else to me. 

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
I don't know…

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.000
how it happened. 

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000
I'm sorry.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000
What happened

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:29.000
was a mistake.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000
A mistake?

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.000
What about that you said you loved me?

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000
You deceived me?

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000
I got it now. 

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000
You probably do this often.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
I'm a fool for believing you.

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.000
It's not like that.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.000
But it shouldn't happen.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Because both of us are men. 

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000
I know it shouldn't be. 

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
But I tried to restrain myself.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000
I stopped you from coming to me. 

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
I was afraid that I couldn't to restrain myself.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
I've tried to suppress my feelings.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.000
But I couldn't do it. 

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
The more I suppress it, the more I feel.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
I want to protect you, Tian.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:03.000
I want to take care of you. I'm worried about you.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:10.000
I tried to force myself to stop all these feelings, but I couldn't.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Jiu. 

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
But you call all these feelings a mistake?

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
It's not love for you?

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000
All that time, 

00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000
I thought that…

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
it was just me who have feelings for you.

00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:52.000
I'm not dreaming, right?

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
You're not dreaming.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:04.000
I won't leave you.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
I will take care of you.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
I promise. 

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Li let all the workers work at the back of the farm.

00:47:58.700 --> 00:48:01.000
You and your mother were locked away. Pin was attacked

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Tian disappeared along with Jiu. 

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Do you want me to believe that Jiu did these alone?

00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:09.000
What do you mean?

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Are you sure that your mother didn't lure you into the barn together?

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Do you mean that you doubt Mother?

00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:20.000
Jiu is Ma's subordinate.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Last time, Ma interfered with Dong's funeral. 

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.000
I'm still suspicious of your mother.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:28.000
But when I was trapped in the barn, Mother was there as well. 

00:48:28.300 --> 00:48:29.000
So how can you be sure…

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000
that she and Jiu didn't know about this?

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000
But the one who ordered all the workers out of the house was Madam Li. 
 

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Why didn't Jiu stay with all the workers?

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.000
He must have been waiting for this opportunity for a long time.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:51.000
But don't tell me that Chan is involved in this.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
I definitely won't let her get away. 

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Can't you knock on the door?

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:09.000
Where is my son? Tell me. 

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
No idea. 

00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:18.000
But even if I know, I won't tell you. 

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.000
Nuan, look at the sinner's face

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000
and remember it as a lesson.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:31.000
Don't go bad, otherwise Karma will go after your child instead.

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Don't look at me. Look at the face of the wicked.

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:38.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Do you think your son will replace Tian easily?

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000
You work with Mr. Ma in the hopes of overthrowing Tian.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000
What do you exchange for? What did you use to lure him?

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.000
You caused the trouble yourself, but blamed others.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Tian's wedding is about to get cancelled.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000
His succession has to be postponed.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:05.000
I don't see the need to find a way to overthrow him. 

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000
It's you

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
who waste your energy to plan to do evil things.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000
I'll tell you something.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:16.000
All the chaos that happened

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
resulted from the fact that you wanted to protect Tian.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000
If anything happened to my son, I won't let you get away for sure. 

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Take the time threatening me to find your son.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
He might have already been killed by this time. 

00:50:30.200 --> 00:50:32.000
Madam Chan. 

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000
I said this out of concern.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Not a curse. 

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.000
Tian.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000
Why are you outside？

00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:12.000
Aren't you cold?

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
We disappear like this.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
I don't know what they are like now at home. 

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.000
It must be a big mess.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
So shall we go back?

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:31.000
No. 

00:51:31.300 --> 00:51:32.000
We can't go back.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Mother saw me and you sleeping together.

00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000
If we go back, 

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
I don't know what you will get. 

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Don't worry about that.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
I can protect myself.

00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:51.000
No one can hurt me.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Jiu. 

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
You don't know my mother well enough.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000
She wants me to inherit the title.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Her big deal is the Five Dragons Association.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
And she…

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:28.000
My mother killed a man. 

00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:33.000
She needs to hide the secret that I'm a homosexual. 

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000
And she saw you with me.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
If we go back, she won't let you go for sure. 

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:45.000
So this is your secret?

00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:53.000
And how does it affect the assumption of your position?

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
I like a man. 

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000
I can't take the position.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Why?

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Even though you're doing your job well, 

00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:10.000
and loved by everyone?

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Yes, my father would definitely not accept it.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
In the past, 

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:29.000
there was a member of the association that was like me.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Then he was oppressed until he had to commit suicide.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
So my mother had to keep a secret\

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000
that I like men.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.000
If everyone knows, 

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.000
the Song family will be ruined because of me.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
I don't want to be the head of the association.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:11.000
I never wanted to. 

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000
I just want to be me.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
About that day?

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Actually, it's weird. 

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:09.000
That day, Aunt Li urged me and Tian to drink tea.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Then Tian was sick.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Or was he sick because of that cup of tea?

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000
But why would Aunt Li poison Tian?

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
This is what I suspect. 

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:26.000
Because it seemed like she let Jiu catch Tian.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Yang.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Did Jiu really capture Tian?

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Pin, he's Mr. Ma's subordinate.

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:45.000
They both disappeared like this, how can I think in another way?

00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Let's go. 

00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.000
Yes. 

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Let's go. 

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:06.000
But I don't think it was like that.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Pin, you go back. I have some business.

00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.000
What's wrong?

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Just go back. I'll explain to you later. 

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Yang.

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:33.000
It hurts.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Mei, how are you?

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Where is Jiu? Please help me. 

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000
Mei.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Wait a moment. I'll go get the medicine.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:49.000
It hurts.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000
So bad. 

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Jiu hasn't got anything yet, Sir?

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:58.000
That girl can't even get up anymore.

00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:00.000
She sleeps all day and talks nonsense.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000
I'm afraid that she will become addicted to opium to death.

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.000
Dead? Is Mei dying?

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:10.000
You poison her? You bastard, bastard.

00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:14.000
Let me go. Let go of me. Help. 

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:15.000
Annoying.

00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Punk, don't be stubborn with me. 

00:57:21.400 --> 00:57:22.000
Or you'll die. 

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000
Gui, lock him up. 

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Go. 

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Bastard, evil. 

00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.000
Let me go, bastard. Let me go. 

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Evil. 

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Mei.

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:51.000
Hey, tie him tight. Find something to cover his mouth.

00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:52.000
Don't let him make any noise.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Bastard.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Put it in his mouth. Right. 

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:02.000
Be quiet.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:07.000
You're lucky that I didn't kill you.

00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.000
Wait for me here and don't even think about running away.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Sir, Madam Chan is here.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Madam, please come inside.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:35.000
She really comes here.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.000
That's your mother, right?

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Yes, it's my mom.

00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Pin. 

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Why did you follow me?

00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:49.000
I told you to go back. It's dangerous.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Because of this, I have to follow you. 

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
I can't just sit still and let you risk your life alone. 

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
What is this about? 

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Why do we spy on them?

00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000
And who do your mother meet?

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Mr. Song already knew that Jiu was your subordinate.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Who told him?

00:59:32.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Cai Xiaotong.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Xiaotong, bitch.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:41.000
How dare she told big brother about me.

00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:45.000
If I am in trouble, I'll kill her.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000
What did he say after knowing that Jiu is my subordinate?

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:55.000
He let people look for him.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
I think that Jiu caught Tian and escaped.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:01.000
And didn't he come here?

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
No. 

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
So did he send you any news?

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.000
You must hurry and find him no matter what. 

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Or it's better to make him and Tian disappear forever.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.000
And don't forget.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Don't ever say that I was part of it.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:34.000
That is…

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Pin, listen to me.

01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:43.000
You go back. I'll tell you later. 

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Please, I'm begging you.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Go back.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Okay. 

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:06.000
Mom!

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Yang, how did you get here?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:11.000
It's not what you think.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:12.000
Don't say anything.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Listen to me first. 

01:01:14.300 --> 01:01:15.000
No need to explain now. Run first.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Run? Why?

01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:18.000
Father is here.

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:19.000
Huh?

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
You can't come in, Sir. 

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Are you sure?

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Big Brother.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.000
This way, please. 

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000
Get out from the back so no one sees you.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Go straight a bit and you've reached the exit.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
I need to go back to Mr. Ma. Please excuse me.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Yang. 

01:02:25.300 --> 01:02:26.000
Don't say anything.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
When we get home, we have a lot to discuss. 

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:32.000
Let's go, Madam. 

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
What happened? Why are you tied like this?

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Brother, help me and my sister please. 

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Hey. 

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.000
Hey. 

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Brother, please get us out of here.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000
Tea, big brother. 

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Follow me.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
They're there. Hold them.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Go.

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:05.000
Go.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000
Stop. 

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Where are you going?

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Go, go. 

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Hey. 

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:20.000
Please take Mei with you. Don't worry about me.

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Hey, check over there. 

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Help me, help. 

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
A culprit caught a child and went over there.

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:16.000
He also snatched my bag. 

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.000
Let's go. 

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I told you already

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
that I didn't know anything.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.000
How did you not know?

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000
I know that Jiu is your subordinate. 

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
You sent him to hurt my son.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Where is my son now? Tell me. 

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.000
If you want to accuse us, you should at least have a proof, Sir.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Shut up!

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Ma. 

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
In the past, you have caused a lot of troubles.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.000
I tried to be patient

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:27.000
for the sake of our brotherhood and friendship.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000
But this time, I can't stand it.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:33.000
because you hurt my child. 

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000
Ma. 

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.000
You know me best.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000
You know what kind of person I was in the past.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Don't force me to become a cruel man like before.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
I told you already

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
that I didn't know where Tian is. 

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Then remember well.

01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000
If anything happened to Tian, 

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:19.000
I'll kill you.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Have you ever seen two men in this picture?

01:09:12.300 --> 01:09:14.000
I don't know where he takes Mr. Tian to?

01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:17.000
We have to Kill Jiu to let Tian's secret die with him. 

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:22.000
If one day I do something bad to you, 

01:09:22.300 --> 01:09:23.000
can you forgive me?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000
If they are woman and man, I think that they have eloped. 

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Where is beetle orchid?

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:34.000
Jia, Jia. 

01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:38.000
We got the news about Jiu's hiding place, Sir.

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000
Jiu. 

01:09:43.300 --> 01:09:44.000
Yang.
