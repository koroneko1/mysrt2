[Núria] I don't know, Albert.
You must have left them at the office!

00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,958
[Albert shouting] I left them
in the kitchen. They were here yesterday.

10
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:39,416
[Núria] Why are you leaving
important documents in the kitchen

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,875
when you have your own office?

12
00:00:40,958 --> 00:00:42,250
Don't you keep any copies?

13
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:44,375
[Albert] They were handmade plans
with corrections.

-Yes. She hasn't seen them either.

-Are you an idiot? No!
-Albert.

18

Is that a letter to the Three Wise Men?

24
00:01:18,083 --> 00:01:20,791
Can you only ask the Three Wise Men
for your own presents,

25
00:01:20,875 --> 00:01:22,208
or can it be for somebody?

26
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,833
I think you can ask for anyone you'd like.

27

-Look.

34

It's the first time
I've shouted at her, Bruno.

35
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:50,291
I'm the worst father in the world.

36
00:01:50,375 --> 00:01:52,916
Well, just take her out
for ice cream later, and it's done.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,791
-I don't know what happened to me.
-You're freaking out. That's normal.

-[sighs]
-It's our most important project.

Ramón and I have a lot at stake, but you?

40
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:02,791
I mean, you're
the new head of the studio soon.

41
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:04,833
-Shh. Shut up, shut up.
-All right, all right.

42
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,208
Crazy. All these years,
we thought Sunyer only put up with you

43
00:02:08,291 --> 00:02:10,041
-'cause you were married to Núria.
-[chuckles]

44
00:02:10,125 --> 00:02:11,083
This one's not working.

-Do you have an eraser?
-Yeah.

-What?

-So… he's eating out of your palm.
-[chuckles]

50
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,458
Since he got back
he leaves Post-its all over the place.

51
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,041
Yeah, I don't know.
He's actually very romantic.

-No, there's no "but."

-There's no "but"?
-There's no "but." You were right.

Ramón is adorable.

57

We have good sex,
and we have a lot of things in common.

That's great, Bruno. That's great.

I got it. Not like with Àlex.

61
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
That… Can you imagine
what that would be like?

[scoffs]

63
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,583
Come on. A remake of an Iranian
<i>Spider-Man </i>is more plausible.

64
00:02:57,666 --> 00:02:59,083
[Albert chuckles]

65
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,458
Take, for example,
something as easy as going to the movies.

66
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,166
Well, I'd choose <i>All About Eve,</i>
and what would he choose?

67
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:09,291
It'd be <i>Frozen…</i> a second time.
Because maybe he didn't get it the first.

68
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:13,250
And, besides, he's allergic to dogs.
What would I do with Puchusky? Huh?

69
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:16,750
Àlex would have to take an antihistamine
at my place. He'd get sick of that.

70
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,750
You know, because they say
it doesn't have side effects, but it does.

71
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,958
And then he'd make me choose
either him or Puchusky.

72
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,125
And there's no way.
I will not abandon Puchusky.

73
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,000
He's the only thing
that gives me joy in life.

74
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:28,250
-And we'd never go to any dinners.
-[both panting]

75
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,166
How could I?

76
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,541
We'd all be there talking about

77
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:34,000
the new urban plans in Tokyo,
and Àlex wouldn't have anything to say.

78
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,458
And you'd make fun of him,
and then make fun of me,

79
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:38,666
and in the end I would stop seeing you.

80
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,166
And we would fight.
We'd argue every day too.

81
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,666
Because I'd see him as a burden,
and he'd see me as a nuisance.

82
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,041
-And, before long, we would break up.
-[grunting]

83
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:49,791
And I'd have no boyfriend, no friends,
no vacations, and no Puchusky.

No, no, no!
Don't you dare touch me with those.

-Yuck! [chuckles]
-No!

-You off?
-Yes.

93
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,041
There's a small problem at the bar.
We lost our caterer for New Year's Eve.

94
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,333
Wait. Shit. What happened?

95
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,666
A salmonella outbreak.
We have to find another one.

96
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,500
Two days before the party?
That's gonna cost a lot.

[Vero] Everyone's already paid.
We can't serve chips.

I've contacted a couple of restaurants

99
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,500
that might be willing
to give us a fair price.

-And what's new about Ibra?

He doesn't just want to fuck.
He's interested in who I am.

Mm-hmm.

And we also have a lot in common,
not like with Bruno.

I mean, can you imagine
my life with Bruno?

00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:05,791
I mean, a concert where Rosalía
and… and Bertín Osborne sang together

111
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,291
would be more plausible.

Come back this afternoon. I'll have them.

And just use the microwave
for sauces and such.

This menu is the basic option.

Three types of hummus, salads,
puff pastries, canapés…

Hello, Núria, sweetheart.

Um, my parents just called,

for New Year's Eve

Yes, Albert. There was a new client
last minute, um, and we decided to accept.

But… But, I mean, you go with the kids.

-No, no, no.

You know how important it is for me.

It was important for me to come out

Vero. And I wanted one thing,
just one thing, Vero.

You respect the most important decision
of my life.

And you couldn't have cared less.

that a boy and a girl couldn't be friends.

That what Ramiro and I were doing

I don't care if he liked men or women.

What matters is that they hid it.

it was what he really wanted
or because he thought he should?

entrusted us

on the Parallel,

that it had to be top level.

of a unique city like Barcelona.

and the neighborhood that hosts it.
