00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:30.204
You'll start your work today!

00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:31.974
Yep!

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.358
What's your name?

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.468
Yes... Yep...

00:02:06.657 --> 00:02:07.820
I'm asking what your name is. 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:10.755
My name is...

00:02:11.538 --> 00:02:12.649
I haven't read your CV yet. 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.629
I just know that you're the one introduced by my sister.

00:02:16.384 --> 00:02:18.849
Uh? How can you know I'm that person and take me home? 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:22.172
Exactly 8:00 A.M this morning!

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:23.445
So that's it! 

00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:26.271
My name is...

00:02:27.067 --> 00:02:27.838
Phong! 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.396
What brand of perfume are you wearing?

00:02:38.683 --> 00:02:39.907
What do you mean?

00:02:40.411 --> 00:02:42.324
I'm asking what your perfume is. 

00:02:43.303 --> 00:02:44.594
I don't wear any perfume. 

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:48.170
How about your washing powder?

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:49.974
The washing powder I'm using is OMO. 

00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:55.951
Ah! I have to come inside! If you need anything, call me! 

00:02:55.951 --> 00:02:57.759
Do you use any herbs?

00:02:58.738 --> 00:03:00.685
Yes, I'm using Alfalfa. 

00:03:01.692 --> 00:03:02.968
How do you use it? 

00:03:03.947 --> 00:03:06.387
I chew and soak it in water.

00:03:06.807 --> 00:03:09.194
I use the rest to diffuse essential oil. 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.218
It's good for both our health and our body's smell. 

00:03:17.034 --> 00:03:19.873
Not everyone uses this way to create the scent, right?

00:03:20.433 --> 00:03:22.540
Yep! 

00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:25.655
Do you know anyone who uses this scent?

00:03:25.963 --> 00:03:26.981
Huh?

00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:31.543
Is it difficult for you to answer?

00:03:33.026 --> 00:03:34.227
Skip it! 

00:03:34.227 --> 00:03:36.393
Just continue your work!

00:03:36.393 --> 00:03:37.302
Yep!

00:04:19.964 --> 00:04:20.681
Phong!

00:04:21.828 --> 00:04:22.607
Yes!

00:04:24.145 --> 00:04:25.097
Phong!

00:04:25.293 --> 00:04:26.800
Yep, you called my name?

00:04:28.031 --> 00:04:29.666
Enter my room to clean it up! 

00:04:30.609 --> 00:04:31.109
Yes!

00:04:49.013 --> 00:04:50.202
 Oh My God 

00:04:51.936 --> 00:04:53.600
You've never seen a naked man?

00:04:55.796 --> 00:04:56.621
Not yet.

00:04:57.432 --> 00:04:58.623
I'm wearing pants.

00:05:03.631 --> 00:05:05.158
Do you like to read?

00:05:07.956 --> 00:05:09.524
No, I don't like

00:05:12.196 --> 00:05:14.384
Well, since I was blind

00:05:14.796 --> 00:05:15.898
 I don't read anymore.

00:05:21.382 --> 00:05:22.678
He went to clean up.

00:05:22.678 --> 00:05:23.559
Yep!

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:41.836
I've got some rice.

00:05:43.151 --> 00:05:44.993
How much MSG do you put in vegetables?

00:05:59.208 --> 00:06:00.392
Half a jar of salt?

00:06:00.868 --> 00:06:01.637
Yep?

00:06:01.637 --> 00:06:03.228
Can you stop yep?

00:06:03.368 --> 00:06:04.137
Yea!

00:06:10.284 --> 00:06:12.950
Next time he put some salt, MSG too.

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.530
What's that?

00:06:17.117 --> 00:06:18.348
Stir-fried beef.

00:06:21.062 --> 00:06:22.701
The beef is still alive.

00:06:25.863 --> 00:06:26.901
Give me sack of beef.

00:06:27.184 --> 00:06:27.806
Yep!

00:06:33.116 --> 00:06:35.106
The largest bag in the left corner.

00:06:38.017 --> 00:06:39.209
Defrost.

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:40.134
Yea!

00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:55.949
Plate.

00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:07.916
Calves go away.

00:07:10.914 --> 00:07:12.793
Why stand still?

00:07:18.612 --> 00:07:19.958
Get your chair back.

00:07:21.021 --> 00:07:23.021
No, you eat it, I've already eaten.

00:07:24.308 --> 00:07:25.061
Get the chair back here!

00:07:31.244 --> 00:07:32.044
Hurry up!

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:43.024
Did you go to work at Duy's place today? 

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:44.755
Yep!

00:07:57.512 --> 00:07:59.220
Have you and I ever met?

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:02.014
Not yet!

00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.134
You studied journalism and communication, didn't you?

00:08:10.372 --> 00:08:11.449
Yep!

00:08:14.777 --> 00:08:16.777
You interviewed me at Coffee Rio?

00:08:19.295 --> 00:08:20.801
Don't faint next time. 

00:08:21.081 --> 00:08:22.326
What are you laughing at?

00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:28.551
I'm sorry, I missed the point.

00:08:35.668 --> 00:08:37.192
His voice was very similar.

00:08:41.859 --> 00:08:43.076
Scent too

00:08:47.364 --> 00:08:47.864
You?

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.305
Yep!

00:08:50.578 --> 00:08:51.078
We are...

00:09:44.031 --> 00:09:44.936
Here's your drinks.

00:09:45.831 --> 00:09:48.000
- Thank you.
- Yes

00:09:52.001 --> 00:09:52.899
Hey.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:56.700
Hold on.

00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:57.219
Yes?

00:10:03.355 --> 00:10:04.763
This voice...

00:10:05.832 --> 00:10:07.607
How can I forget it?

00:10:08.698 --> 00:10:10.599
Never forget it! 

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:18.865
Phuc

00:10:20.571 --> 00:10:21.071
Yes

00:10:25.435 --> 00:10:26.476
Take this and eat it

00:10:26.672 --> 00:10:27.663
Thank you

00:10:39.497 --> 00:10:40.968
It turns out that you look like this!

00:10:42.171 --> 00:10:44.377
Do you know how long I've been waiting for you?

00:10:45.748 --> 00:10:47.695
If I knew it was the easiest way to find you, 

00:10:48.814 --> 00:10:50.523
I wouldn't have lost you for 6 years.

00:11:03.784 --> 00:11:05.693
Ah! I'm sorry! I overslept. 

00:11:07.567 --> 00:11:09.712
If you keep doing that next time, you'll be fined! 

00:11:09.964 --> 00:11:10.719
Huh?

00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:12.638
Or you want to be punished right now?

00:11:13.225 --> 00:11:14.486
You just made the rules,

00:11:14.822 --> 00:11:16.717
so ignore them and enforce them next time.

00:11:17.556 --> 00:11:20.835
I don't know! I'll punish you! 

00:11:23.381 --> 00:11:24.823
Why did you punch me?

00:11:25.131 --> 00:11:26.202
Because you dare to tease me! 

00:11:26.398 --> 00:11:27.697
Do I look like I'm teasing you?

00:11:27.697 --> 00:11:29.342
You think your act is not joking with me?

00:11:29.342 --> 00:11:31.397
Hey! I even haven't fired you yet!

00:11:31.397 --> 00:11:32.143
Hey! 

00:11:32.535 --> 00:11:34.343
Why do you keep wanting to fire me?

00:11:37.728 --> 00:11:39.374
I only said it once!

00:11:42.144 --> 00:11:43.310
I'm leaving to do my work!

00:11:45.045 --> 00:11:46.338
Just say it clearly!

00:11:46.534 --> 00:11:48.216
Is it true that we have never met?

00:11:48.552 --> 00:11:50.384
Uhm... I was interviewed by you!

00:11:51.755 --> 00:11:53.851
That's not what I meant!

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.326
What do you mean? 

00:11:57.704 --> 00:11:59.218
It's the kind of holding hands, 

00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:01.334
hugging, 

00:12:02.845 --> 00:12:03.425
and kissing! 

00:12:05.646 --> 00:12:06.916
This boy! 

00:12:09.518 --> 00:12:10.253
Stop your habit of teasing me! 

00:13:00.895 --> 00:13:02.636
Why hasn't he come yet?

00:13:17.491 --> 00:13:18.409
Why are you staring at me?

00:13:19.584 --> 00:13:20.734
Clean my shoes for me! 

00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:26.587
It's too much! 

00:13:28.405 --> 00:13:29.887
So be it!

00:13:43.427 --> 00:13:44.431
Remember wipe them clean!

00:13:57.999 --> 00:13:59.920
You really look like Cinderella!

00:14:01.794 --> 00:14:04.875
You're not a prince, though!

00:14:55.309 --> 00:14:57.680
I just went a little bit, but you drank as much.

00:15:12.842 --> 00:15:14.863
Have you lived well in the past few years?

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:17.501
Have you gone and don't want to come back?

00:15:21.418 --> 00:15:22.913
You didn't change anything.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.156
You're just fatter than before!

00:15:26.946 --> 00:15:30.280
We seem to be no different from before.

00:15:31.986 --> 00:15:34.470
Only life becomes different! 

00:15:37.323 --> 00:15:40.179
Don't drink beer anymore! It's not good for you! 

00:15:50.502 --> 00:15:53.154
Yes! I'm at Thach's house! 

00:15:54.385 --> 00:15:56.229
I won't let him recognize me! 

00:15:56.844 --> 00:15:58.193
Focus on finding another helper, sis! 

00:15:58.445 --> 00:15:59.731
I've already decided!

00:16:01.242 --> 00:16:03.943
There is sadness and joy 

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:06.734
but no hope!

00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:11.793
I got it! See you tonight! 

00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:12.623
You drank it and then spewed it for what? 

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:14.819
If you have discomfort, just spew it all. 

00:18:18.819 --> 00:18:19.731
Who are you? 

00:18:31.985 --> 00:18:33.012
You are the house owner, huh? 

00:18:40.537 --> 00:18:41.398
Let me bring you home! 

00:18:43.216 --> 00:18:45.891
Do you know where my house is that take me home?

00:18:46.534 --> 00:18:48.000
It's okay as long as you don't sleep on the street. 

00:18:49.539 --> 00:18:50.636
Don't care wherever I go!

00:18:51.249 --> 00:18:52.101
I won't go with you! 

00:18:52.101 --> 00:18:54.027
Why do you keep being stubborn? 

00:18:54.447 --> 00:18:55.785
Don't mind whatever I do! 

00:18:57.212 --> 00:18:57.954
You talk too much! 

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.979
Do you want me to use violence? 

00:19:04.532 --> 00:19:05.642
Your leg is dislocated, right? 

00:19:11.097 --> 00:19:12.297
What are you doing? 

00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:14.845
Why do you always bother me? 

00:19:16.272 --> 00:19:17.290
Because you are so stubborn.

00:19:18.801 --> 00:19:20.034
Why should I follow what you said?

00:19:22.664 --> 00:19:24.258
If you did what I said, 

00:19:24.426 --> 00:19:25.894
we wouldn't have lost 6 years. 

00:19:34.874 --> 00:19:36.337
You have got the wrong person! 

00:19:38.351 --> 00:19:39.549
I see you are bothering me. 

00:19:41.423 --> 00:19:42.553
Don't touch me anymore!
