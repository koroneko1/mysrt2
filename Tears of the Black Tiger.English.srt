00:01:37,375 --> 00:01:43,875
A MEMENTO TO KEEP WHEN WE FAR APART
RAPIN

2
00:02:33,916 --> 00:02:35,000
Hey, Yoi!

3
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,208
It's me Mahesuan!

4
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:40,458
Fai sent me here.

5
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,166
Come on out here and talk.

6
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:45,958
Yoi!

7
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:50,083
If you don't come out,

8
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,125
I'm coming in. Hey!

9
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,166
Mahesuan, if you want to eat
some lead, just come on up!

10
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:07,541
Wait!

11
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,666
DID YOU CATCH THAT?

12
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,208
IF NOT, WE'LL PLAY IT AGAIN…

13
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,541
Yoi!

14
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,458
Fai sent me to deliver your reward

15
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,541
for singing to the police.

16
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,541
Dum! Hang on!

17
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,208
Wait for me!

18
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,166
Hey, Dum!

19
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,833
-Where the hell are you going?
-I need to see someone.

20
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:55,875
What is it with him?

21
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:36,250
Don't cry now, my little one.

22
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:37,875
Oh, nurse,

23
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,291
he never came.

24
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:45,333
He broke his promise.

25
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,875
Oh, my poor dear.

26
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,250
Don't be sad.

27
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:52,166
Come take a bath now
and change out of these clothes.

28
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,083
Look,

29
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:57,041
you're all soaked through.

30
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:01,125
And tomorrow's your big day…

31
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:06,375
Tomorrow…

32
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:10,083
what shall I do?

33
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,458
Tomorrow you'll be engaged.

34
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:15,083
There's no other way now.

35
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,958
Now you two are one.

36
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,333
For Kumjorn and Rumpoey,

37
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:51,416
I hope you live together in harmony
and be faithful to each other.

38
00:11:52,125 --> 00:11:54,583
I wish you, my dear children,

39
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,875
a beautiful couple

40
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,791
and prosperity in your life.

41
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,458
This is my law.

42
00:12:15,291 --> 00:12:17,125
If you betray Fai,

43
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:18,791
you will die.

44
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:25,708
Yoi didn't learn it
until he was in his grave.

45
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,666
Dum, my right-hand man,

46
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,000
had to teach him.

47
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,041
You see, Somjit? I told you.

48
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,458
Dum's not like any other person.

49
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:37,958
He never misses.

50
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,666
Right, boss.

51
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,625
I've never seen anyone like him

52
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,791
in my entire life.

53
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,416
He's the best gunslinger on earth!

54
00:12:51,458 --> 00:12:53,000
I mean, along with you, Mahesuan.

55
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,500
What do you think, Mahesuan?

56
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,166
You have met your match!

57
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:00,750
Hey!

58
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,750
Where the hell is Dum anyway?

59
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,208
Go and fetch him for me.

60
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,916
I'll get him myself, boss.

61
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:00,541
Oh, this is a laugh!

62
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,875
Who'd have thought
the great "Black Tiger,"

63
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:10,166
said to kill men without even blinking,

64
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:14,208
crack shot, the fastest man in the land,

65
00:14:15,416 --> 00:14:20,333
was also master of the harmonica!

66
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,625
What?

67
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,916
Don't stop! Go on!

68
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,916
I was just starting
to get all carried away.

69
00:14:39,708 --> 00:14:41,083
You know,

70
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:45,583
although I don't know much about music,

71
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:48,583
but it sounds like

72
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,125
your song

73
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:54,291
was about something sad and lonely.

74
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,958
Like someone's got a broken heart.

75
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,583
Hey!

76
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,333
Now, I'm sure!
This is a woman's handkerchief!

77
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,125
The big Black Tiger
has fallen in love, then?

78
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,250
Mahesuan! Give that back!

79
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:25,083
Hey! What's wrong with you?

80
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,375
I'm just kidding.
What are you so riled about?

81
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,291
Come on.

82
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,791
Give it back to me

83
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,166
or I'll kick your ass!

84
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,333
Then bring it on!

85
00:15:41,416 --> 00:15:42,416
Come on!

86
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,416
I want to know how good you are, Dum.

87
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,916
You think you're tight with Fai, do you?

88
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,958
Bring it on!

89
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,166
Let's make it clear now.

90
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,541
Between the Black Tiger and Mahesuan

91
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,791
who's the best gunslinger?

92
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:04,041
Draw!

93
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,166
I saw it up in the branches,

94
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,208
getting ready to bite you.

95
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:45,541
Dum,

96
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,583
you saved my life!

97
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:28,000
A MEMENTO TO KEEP WHEN WE FAR APART
RAPIN

98
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:46,458
TEN YEARS AGO

99
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:07,083
BANG PLA MA JUNCTION

100
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:36,125
Dum, I saw a swamp full of lotus blossoms.

101
00:20:36,875 --> 00:20:39,166
Take me there
to pick up some lotus, would you?

102
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,500
Dum!

103
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:47,416
Take me rowing. Now!

104
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,916
The city has so many fun things.

105
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,666
There are cinemas and theaters everywhere!

106
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:11,916
And on weekends,

107
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,958
my father takes me to Bang Pu Beach.

108
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:18,666
Have you ever been to Bang Pu?

109
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,458
I've heard of it.

110
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,333
I heard it's very beautiful.

111
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,166
But my whole life

112
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,916
I've never seen the sea.

113
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,208
Really?

114
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:30,958
You've never seen the sea?

115
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,166
That's a shame.

116
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:40,208
The sea is where the water meets the sky.

117
00:21:41,125 --> 00:21:44,541
So huge and wide
that it makes you feel tiny.

118
00:21:45,416 --> 00:21:48,791
It has a beautiful blue color

119
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,875
lovely cool breezes,

120
00:21:50,958 --> 00:21:53,000
and waves that break
on the shore all day and night.

121
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,583
I wish I could see it just once.

122
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,916
Well, when you come
to visit me in Bangkok,

123
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,916
I'll ask my father to take us there.

124
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,166
But first,

125
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,083
you must be good to me,

126
00:22:08,958 --> 00:22:11,250
do everything I say. Understand?

127
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,250
Very good! Now…

128
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,916
take me over there.

129
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,875
How beautiful!

130
00:22:46,958 --> 00:22:50,458
Who built such a beautiful pavilion
in the marsh?

131
00:22:52,041 --> 00:22:54,958
This pavilion is called
"Awaiting the Maiden" pavilion.

132
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,041
Why is it called that?

133
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,583
My father has told me a story.

134
00:23:01,083 --> 00:23:02,416
Long ago,

135
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,708
a poor young woodcutter

136
00:23:05,375 --> 00:23:07,083
lived in this forest.

137
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:10,958
One day, he met a rich man's daughter

138
00:23:11,041 --> 00:23:13,375
who come from the city
to rest in the forest.

139
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:17,541
They fell deeply in love

140
00:23:17,625 --> 00:23:19,250
and swore

141
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:21,916
they'd run away together

142
00:23:22,458 --> 00:23:24,666
when the wildflowers fell

143
00:23:25,166 --> 00:23:27,791
from the trees.

144
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:31,333
So the woodcutter gathered
the very best wood,

145
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:33,750
from the very best trees,

146
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,375
to build her a beautiful pavilion.

147
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,250
Then, every year

148
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,666
when the wildflowers fell,

149
00:23:41,333 --> 00:23:43,875
he'd wait for her here in the pavilion

150
00:23:44,541 --> 00:23:46,208
but she never came.

151
00:23:46,291 --> 00:23:48,625
But why did she break her promise?

152
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:52,666
Her father caught her leaving the house

153
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,875
and locked her in her room.

154
00:23:56,458 --> 00:24:01,458
When she knew she'd never meet her lover,

155
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:03,416
she hung herself.

156
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,041
The pavilion has been called
"Awaiting the Maiden" ever since.

157
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,125
Why are you crying?

158
00:24:13,041 --> 00:24:14,625
It's just a story.

159
00:24:14,708 --> 00:24:16,750
We don't even know if it's true.

160
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,666
I feel sorry for the girl
and the woodcutter.

161
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,083
Come on now. Let's go home.

162
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:24,791
It's getting dark. I'll get in trouble.

163
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:26,666
Come on!

164
00:25:04,125 --> 00:25:06,166
What's with your rowing, idiot?

165
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:10,000
Can't you watch where you're going?

166
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:16,291
Look who it is! It's Dum. Dua's son.

167
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,416
Where are you rushing to, Dum?

168
00:25:19,916 --> 00:25:21,458
Koh! Let it go.

169
00:25:21,541 --> 00:25:23,500
No! You got a problem?

170
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,375
He said let go. We're hurrying home.

171
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:30,125
Man! Dum, you've got a brave
girlfriend here.

172
00:25:30,208 --> 00:25:31,666
You're crazy! I'm not his girlfriend.

173
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,833
Oh, yeah? So why are you two
out alone in a boat, then?

174
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:36,458
Right, guys?

175
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:40,666
Hey, baby, why don't you be my girl?

176
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:41,791
Let go of me!

177
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:44,000
Koh, leave her alone!

178
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:46,041
Dum! You to dare hit me?

179
00:25:46,125 --> 00:25:47,916
You're dead! Get him!

180
00:25:52,208 --> 00:25:54,208
Don't fight!

181
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:55,666
That's enough, Dum!

182
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,125
Don't! That's enough!

183
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,291
Dum! Look out!

184
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:05,500
Dum. Are you all right?

185
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,208
Dum.

186
00:26:08,916 --> 00:26:10,000
Dum, don't!

187
00:26:15,916 --> 00:26:18,791
Dum! Enough! Stop fighting!

188
00:26:18,875 --> 00:26:20,625
Dum's gone mental! Help me!

189
00:26:21,875 --> 00:26:23,875
Dum, please stop it!

190
00:26:23,958 --> 00:26:25,333
Enough!

191
00:26:31,750 --> 00:26:33,291
Come on. Let's go!

192
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:35,083
Before he hits me again.

193
00:27:40,375 --> 00:27:42,041
Have you found them yet, Dua?

194
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,000
Not yet, sir.

195
00:27:44,583 --> 00:27:46,166
The servants say.

196
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,791
Dum took the little miss out rowing, sir.

197
00:27:49,375 --> 00:27:52,250
They're probably caught in the rain.

198
00:27:52,333 --> 00:27:54,541
I've already sent some men to look.

199
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:58,625
Dua, how the hell did you raise your son?

200
00:27:59,458 --> 00:28:02,833
You let him keep my girl out
until dark like this?

201
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:06,041
What if something happened to her?

202
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:09,250
She's my only daughter, Dua.

203
00:28:11,416 --> 00:28:12,958
When Dum gets back,

204
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,750
he'll get the whipping of his life, sir.

205
00:28:16,583 --> 00:28:17,708
They're back!

206
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,583
What's wrong with my daughter?

207
00:28:35,583 --> 00:28:37,250
Bring her here. Help her!

208
00:28:40,333 --> 00:28:43,125
Dum, how could you do this?

209
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,250
What if she's hurt?

210
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:48,000
Come here.
I'm going to whip you until you're raw!

211
00:28:53,416 --> 00:28:56,083
You ungrateful child! Take this to heart!

212
00:28:56,166 --> 00:28:58,208
After today you'll never do this again!

213
00:28:58,958 --> 00:29:00,333
Never do it again!

214
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,708
Never again!

215
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,625
Never again!

216
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:12,833
Remember! Never again!

217
00:29:13,833 --> 00:29:15,791
FRAGRANCE'S GONE
BY THE END OF THE NIGHT

218
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:16,916
BRING FRESHNESS WITH IT

219
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,833
LOVE AND YEARNING ON MY SIDE

220
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:22,083
HAVE ALWAYS LEFT IN THIS MOONLIT

221
00:30:56,041 --> 00:30:57,291
With your permission, sir…

222
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,708
Sure. Kumjorn. Seat yourself.

223
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:07,375
There's an urgent concern
and I need your advice, sir.

224
00:31:08,416 --> 00:31:11,208
Since I've been stationed in Suphan Buri,

225
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:14,458
I haven't proved myself.

226
00:31:14,541 --> 00:31:16,791
Just sat and slept and hung around.

227
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,166
I don't feel I'm earning my salary.

228
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,916
Just as I thought.

229
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:25,416
The young city-trained man,
transferred upcountry,

230
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:28,291
loaded with energy…

231
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:33,083
You're anxious to show
what you've got. It's natural.

232
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:34,416
No, sir.

233
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,291
I just want to help
and protect the people.

234
00:31:37,833 --> 00:31:40,291
That's the reason
I trained to be a policeman.

235
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,708
Also, I came here to see

236
00:31:44,583 --> 00:31:48,125
with my own eyes the "city of bandits"

237
00:31:48,916 --> 00:31:50,750
I've been hearing about.

238
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:53,666
I think you've already seen
what it's like.

239
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:56,458
This morning,

240
00:31:57,125 --> 00:31:59,875
I investigated a murder
committed by Fai's gang.

241
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:04,750
Nine members of a rich family
were cruelly robbed and killed.

242
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:08,416
I'm outraged.

243
00:32:09,125 --> 00:32:12,708
They can mock us like this
and still be at large.

244
00:32:13,541 --> 00:32:17,208
-Do you plan to take on?
-Yes, sir.

245
00:32:18,333 --> 00:32:21,250
I'm willing to lead the troop.

246
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:23,791
What do you think, sir?

247
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:27,541
I admire your bravery

248
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:30,291
and determination, Kumjorn.

249
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,458
You're a very fine young man.

250
00:32:34,541 --> 00:32:37,750
That's why I'm giving you
my daughter's hand in marriage.

251
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,291
But I have to warn you,

252
00:32:43,708 --> 00:32:45,958
as a governor

253
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:48,458
and as someone born here in Suphan Buri.

254
00:32:49,208 --> 00:32:51,250
This province is plagued
with thieves and killers

255
00:32:52,083 --> 00:32:54,291
and suppressing them is very difficult.

256
00:32:54,791 --> 00:32:56,458
Especially Fai.

257
00:32:57,666 --> 00:32:59,625
We have no leads on him.

258
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:03,041
No one will even open their mouths.

259
00:33:04,333 --> 00:33:06,958
Because Fai kills everyone

260
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:09,666
who informs on him.

261
00:33:10,375 --> 00:33:14,291
You need not worry sir.
Luck is on our side.

262
00:33:15,041 --> 00:33:17,625
One of Fai's henchmen came to repent

263
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,250
and became our informant.

264
00:33:19,333 --> 00:33:21,708
He'll lead us straight to Fai's lair.

265
00:33:53,791 --> 00:33:56,083
Sergeant Yam, did you say goodbye
to your wife yet?

266
00:33:56,708 --> 00:33:58,833
Sir! Every one of them, sir!

267
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:01,833
What? How many do you have?

268
00:34:02,791 --> 00:34:04,208
Sir! Seven wives, sir!

269
00:34:06,166 --> 00:34:08,583
This is heavy, indeed.

270
00:34:09,375 --> 00:34:11,083
After today's mission,

271
00:34:11,166 --> 00:34:12,958
I'm afraid they'll all be widowed.

272
00:34:13,958 --> 00:34:16,041
Sir! I told them if I don't make it

273
00:34:16,125 --> 00:34:17,791
they can find new husbands, sir!

274
00:35:14,458 --> 00:35:17,666
Ms. Rumpoey, I've come to say goodbye.

275
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:21,291
It's official business
and I must leave immediately.

276
00:35:23,666 --> 00:35:25,916
But I wanted to see your face first.

277
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,541
I'll be gone for many days.

278
00:35:30,625 --> 00:35:32,708
Sorry to bother you so early.

279
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,500
No bother.

280
00:35:36,333 --> 00:35:38,416
Captain is my fiance now.

281
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,708
Won't you wish me luck?

282
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:46,083
I wish you good luck

283
00:35:47,041 --> 00:35:48,916
and safe return.

284
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:55,750
I'll be always thinking of you.

285
00:35:56,666 --> 00:35:59,625
I'll beg the days and nights to rush by
until I see you once more.

286
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:09,833
Captain, you had best go.
Your men are waiting.

287
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:17,166
Farewell, my dear Rumpoey.

288
00:36:36,791 --> 00:36:38,000
May I

289
00:36:38,666 --> 00:36:40,625
take your photo with me?

290
00:36:41,458 --> 00:36:44,208
It could be my good-luck charm.

291
00:36:46,250 --> 00:36:48,833
-Help yourself.
-Thank you.

292
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,625
I'll guard it with my life

293
00:36:53,583 --> 00:36:56,500
and keep it by my heart at all times.

294
00:37:26,791 --> 00:37:29,625
By everything sacred in this world,

295
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:32,750
I, Mahesuan,

296
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,541
swear, with Buddha as my witness,

297
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,541
I'll always be true

298
00:37:38,541 --> 00:37:41,750
and loyal to my blood brother
Dum, the Black Tiger,

299
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,500
who saved my life.

300
00:37:45,541 --> 00:37:47,916
If I break this oath,

301
00:37:50,166 --> 00:37:51,708
may his gun

302
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:54,500
end my own.

303
00:39:17,666 --> 00:39:21,083
THE POLICE ARE IN TROUBLE
FAI'S GANG ROBBED UNDER THEIR NOSE

304
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,666
FAI SHOTS HIS HENCHMAN
THEN ROBBED THE POLICE STATION

305
00:39:44,791 --> 00:39:48,000
THE GOVERNOR ORDERED
TROOPS TO ATTACK FAI'S GANG

306
00:41:14,166 --> 00:41:15,791
Attack!

307
00:41:47,958 --> 00:41:50,333
Tigers! Fight to the death!

308
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:03,083
-Where are you going?
-My job's done, Captain.

309
00:42:03,166 --> 00:42:04,625
I've already led you here.

310
00:42:04,708 --> 00:42:06,833
-If Fai sees me, I'm dead.
-Not yet.

311
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,583
You must identify the real Fai first.

312
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:11,208
Sergeant, restrain him!

313
00:42:25,458 --> 00:42:29,375
-Sergeant Yam, show them your bomb throw!
-Yes, sir!

314
00:42:42,208 --> 00:42:44,791
Good shot, Yam!
But why is there no explosion?

315
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:48,625
Damn!

316
00:42:49,208 --> 00:42:50,750
I forgot to pull the pin!

317
00:42:51,333 --> 00:42:53,500
Request permission to throw again, sir!

318
00:43:06,583 --> 00:43:09,250
Yod, bring me some ammo.

319
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:12,666
We're running out of bullets, boss.
Just rifles and pistols left.

320
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:15,833
-What should we do?
-Damn it! Give it to me!

321
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:19,041
Fight to the last bullet.

322
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,666
Yod, give me a pistol.

323
00:44:27,833 --> 00:44:30,416
Shit! The police are attacking!

324
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,041
Dum! Quick!

325
00:44:53,708 --> 00:44:56,291
Dum and Mahesuan are here!

326
00:44:56,375 --> 00:44:58,125
Now it's my turn!

327
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,583
Stop! Arrest him!

328
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,541
No!

329
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,541
Please spare me, boss!

330
00:46:43,625 --> 00:46:45,625
I made a mistake! Boss!

331
00:46:46,416 --> 00:46:48,291
Forgive me.

332
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,625
Boss, please!

333
00:46:52,875 --> 00:46:55,500
You're right! You made a mistake

334
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:57,833
when you betrayed me!

335
00:46:59,083 --> 00:47:00,416
You know what?

336
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:05,958
Now your whole life's only worth one cent.

337
00:47:06,041 --> 00:47:07,291
See this?

338
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,916
The coin has a hole in it.

339
00:47:12,375 --> 00:47:16,208
Somjit, I'll give you a chance.

340
00:47:19,041 --> 00:47:22,500
If my bullet can't get through it,

341
00:47:24,333 --> 00:47:25,416
you live.

342
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:28,416
But if it can,

343
00:47:31,083 --> 00:47:32,125
you die!

344
00:48:06,458 --> 00:48:07,916
My law is simple.

345
00:48:08,666 --> 00:48:12,333
Whoever betrays Fai dies!

346
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:22,750
Dum!

347
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,666
This is your duty now.

348
00:48:28,125 --> 00:48:31,166
That filthy captain
has been locked up in the cabin.

349
00:48:32,541 --> 00:48:34,958
He's the last living person
who knows where our hideout is.

350
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:39,041
Go finish him.

351
00:49:01,375 --> 00:49:04,375
Captain, forgive me.

352
00:49:10,958 --> 00:49:13,291
So, this is the end of me.

353
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:20,750
Black Tiger, since I'm about to die,

354
00:49:21,875 --> 00:49:23,875
let me die with dignity.

355
00:49:25,583 --> 00:49:27,416
Untie me.

356
00:49:59,916 --> 00:50:01,791
Thank you. Black Tiger.

357
00:50:04,958 --> 00:50:08,791
If I ask a final favor

358
00:50:10,125 --> 00:50:11,458
will you do it?

359
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,458
If I can, I will.

360
00:50:17,916 --> 00:50:19,625
After I die,

361
00:50:20,875 --> 00:50:22,458
there's someone

362
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:25,458
I'd ask you to inform.

363
00:50:27,583 --> 00:50:28,791
I'm afraid

364
00:50:29,708 --> 00:50:32,166
she'll be waiting for me anxiously.

365
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,083
Your wife?

366
00:50:38,208 --> 00:50:39,250
My fiancee.

367
00:50:40,958 --> 00:50:43,083
We're about to get married.

368
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:48,250
But now all hope's gone.

369
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:51,541
-Here…
-Captain!

370
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:55,333
-No tricks!
-Of course not.

371
00:50:56,208 --> 00:50:58,958
I was only showing you her photo.

372
00:51:00,375 --> 00:51:01,500
Slowly!

373
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:04,875
If you try anything, I'll shoot.

374
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:24,333
Her name's Rumpoey Rajasena.

375
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,458
We were engaged only last month.

376
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:33,000
If you will,

377
00:51:33,916 --> 00:51:37,958
please let her know of my fate.

378
00:51:40,041 --> 00:51:42,333
Tell her that I,

379
00:51:44,125 --> 00:51:47,083
Captain Kumjorn, her fiance,

380
00:51:47,166 --> 00:51:48,666
have died.

381
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:51,583
But I loved her

382
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:55,541
and thought of her until the very end.

383
00:51:57,916 --> 00:52:00,208
Dum, will you do this?

384
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:12,000
Dum, I'm begging you.

385
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:14,625
Help me!

386
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,291
Please.

387
00:52:18,208 --> 00:52:20,250
If you must kill me after that, go ahead.

388
00:52:22,208 --> 00:52:23,500
Go ahead and do it.

389
00:52:45,333 --> 00:52:46,791
Everything in order Dum?

390
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,708
Dum! What happened?

391
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:58,458
He's gone.

392
00:52:59,541 --> 00:53:00,916
What the hell?

393
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:02,833
How could you let him get away?

394
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:16,625
Dum!

395
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:19,833
Hey.

396
00:53:19,916 --> 00:53:23,000
Dum's been stabbed. Go get help!

397
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:25,375
Quick! Goddamn it!

398
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:27,166
Dum!

399
00:53:28,291 --> 00:53:30,416
Dum! Stay with me, friend.

400
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:34,333
Dum!

401
00:54:03,791 --> 00:54:04,708
Rumpoey…

402
00:54:08,958 --> 00:54:09,958
Rumpoey…

403
00:54:14,333 --> 00:54:18,250
BANGKOK, ONE YEAR AGO

404
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:57,958
Dum.

405
00:54:58,791 --> 00:54:59,916
Dum.

406
00:55:01,958 --> 00:55:03,166
It's you, isn't it?

407
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:06,958
It's me, Rumpoey. Do you remember me?

408
00:55:14,125 --> 00:55:16,250
I'm sorry, madam.

409
00:55:16,333 --> 00:55:17,750
You have the wrong person.

410
00:55:22,875 --> 00:55:23,916
Wait, Dum!

411
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,583
Do you really not know me?

412
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,583
I've never met you before.

413
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:33,625
Besides,

414
00:55:34,416 --> 00:55:37,166
my name is not Dum.

415
00:55:37,833 --> 00:55:39,125
What is your name, then?

416
00:55:41,416 --> 00:55:43,625
My name is Rapin.

417
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:25,166
This harmonica is proof!

418
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:27,916
I gave you this ten years ago.

419
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:29,291
Remember, Dum?

420
00:56:34,458 --> 00:56:37,166
Anyone could have a harmonica like this.

421
00:56:38,458 --> 00:56:39,916
You're mistaken.

422
00:56:40,791 --> 00:56:42,958
This harmonica belongs to me.

423
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,375
I'm not someone important enough

424
00:56:48,458 --> 00:56:49,708
for you to know.

425
00:56:50,291 --> 00:56:51,833
Not now

426
00:56:51,916 --> 00:56:53,458
and not ten years ago.

427
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,291
Please leave me be, madam.

428
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,708
You're lying, Dum!

429
00:57:02,541 --> 00:57:05,000
You're lying and you know it.

430
00:57:06,208 --> 00:57:07,208
Look!

431
00:57:08,041 --> 00:57:10,125
I engraved my name on it.

432
00:57:11,166 --> 00:57:12,958
Rumpoey Rajasena.

433
00:57:13,791 --> 00:57:16,166
You see it every time you play.

434
00:57:17,916 --> 00:57:21,083
But why deny it?

435
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,750
Do you want to forget me, Dum?

436
00:57:26,833 --> 00:57:28,416
You hate me, right?

437
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:31,291
That's why you pretend not to know me.

438
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,041
You're still angry with me

439
00:57:34,125 --> 00:57:38,291
because I have caused you
to be punished at that time.

440
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,750
Is that right, Dum?

441
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,583
Please give me back my harmonica.

442
00:57:56,250 --> 00:57:59,250
Yes. I already gave it to you.

443
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,375
It's definitely yours.

444
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:05,500
But I want to tell you

445
00:58:06,458 --> 00:58:07,916
that these whole ten years,

446
00:58:09,041 --> 00:58:12,291
I've thought of you every day and night.

447
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:16,208
And every time I pictured you,

448
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:21,083
I saw the scar on your face.
It was my fault.

449
00:58:22,208 --> 00:58:23,541
That scar…

450
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,916
You got it because

451
00:58:26,583 --> 00:58:28,333
you tried to protect me.

452
00:58:32,291 --> 00:58:34,166
Every day for ten years,

453
00:58:35,333 --> 00:58:36,916
I prayed

454
00:58:37,833 --> 00:58:39,958
that I would see you again.

455
00:58:41,708 --> 00:58:44,666
No matter how long,
I'm happy to have a chance

456
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:47,875
to tell you

457
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:53,416
what I should have said long ago.

458
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:56,833
I'm very sorry.

459
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:01,500
If you're finished speaking now,

460
00:59:03,416 --> 00:59:04,750
I'll be going.

461
01:00:38,166 --> 01:00:40,375
Hey there, Rumpoey!

462
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,083
Jedsada! You scared me to death!

463
01:00:43,708 --> 01:00:45,375
What are you doing around here?

464
01:00:46,291 --> 01:00:47,458
Don't you know

465
01:00:48,125 --> 01:00:53,041
this is no place for a lady

466
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:55,916
to go strolling!

467
01:00:57,333 --> 01:00:58,333
I'm going home.

468
01:01:00,250 --> 01:01:01,583
How about a ride?

469
01:01:02,208 --> 01:01:05,375
I'll take you for a spin in my MG.

470
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,541
No. I have my own ride.

471
01:01:07,625 --> 01:01:09,333
Get out of my way.

472
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,166
Come on, Rumpoey.

473
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:15,166
I'm your old pal.

474
01:01:16,166 --> 01:01:19,708
No need to be so cold.

475
01:01:28,958 --> 01:01:30,083
Rumpoey,

476
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:32,708
let me keep you

477
01:01:33,291 --> 01:01:35,166
for ten minutes,

478
01:01:35,708 --> 01:01:37,291
then I'll let you go.

479
01:01:39,041 --> 01:01:41,333
Otherwise…

480
01:01:42,375 --> 01:01:44,583
-What will you do?
-Me?

481
01:01:45,625 --> 01:01:48,541
I'll steal a kiss from you.

482
01:01:49,958 --> 01:01:51,708
Don't you dare! You bastard!

483
01:01:55,708 --> 01:01:57,666
How dare you slap me!

484
01:01:59,541 --> 01:02:00,541
Well, then.

485
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,541
If you disrespect me…

486
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:08,000
I'll disrespect you!

487
01:02:08,583 --> 01:02:10,833
-Don't! Let me go!
-Stay still!

488
01:02:10,916 --> 01:02:13,875
-Help!
-I just want a little kiss!

489
01:02:13,958 --> 01:02:16,583
-Help me!
-You two! Grab her!

490
01:02:18,125 --> 01:02:19,666
-Help! Help!
-Stay still!

491
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,000
Dum!

492
01:02:25,625 --> 01:02:28,208
Koh! Let her go now!

493
01:02:31,458 --> 01:02:34,166
Well, well. Look who's here!

494
01:02:35,083 --> 01:02:37,958
Dum. Dua's son himself.

495
01:02:38,041 --> 01:02:39,166
Hey!

496
01:02:39,916 --> 01:02:43,625
You know her too, Dum?

497
01:02:45,583 --> 01:02:47,125
How the hell could a peasant

498
01:02:48,250 --> 01:02:50,791
know a girl from a rich family?

499
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,916
Are you going to play the goddamned hero?

500
01:02:55,625 --> 01:02:57,083
Come on.

501
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:00,750
Don't you even remember

502
01:03:01,625 --> 01:03:04,541
who gave that scar…

503
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:07,125
on your face?

504
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:10,250
Hey, Scarface?

505
01:03:13,791 --> 01:03:16,083
Stop it! Don't fight!

506
01:03:18,291 --> 01:03:20,083
Dum! Watch out!

507
01:03:24,708 --> 01:03:25,666
Stop it!

508
01:03:26,208 --> 01:03:27,291
Stop it!

509
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,416
We can't win. Let's get out of here!

510
01:03:44,208 --> 01:03:46,708
Dum, are you all right?

511
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:49,125
Does it hurt?

512
01:03:52,333 --> 01:03:53,583
Dum!

513
01:03:54,791 --> 01:03:57,375
Dum. Come back.

514
01:04:24,583 --> 01:04:27,083
Dum! Dum! Hold on.

515
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:30,625
Dum…

516
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:34,875
What happened to you? Tell me.

517
01:04:40,250 --> 01:04:43,416
They kicked me out of college.

518
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,083
Oh, dear.

519
01:04:45,166 --> 01:04:46,250
Why?

520
01:04:47,041 --> 01:04:49,166
You didn't start it.

521
01:04:50,125 --> 01:04:52,916
They're the one
who deserves the punishment.

522
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:55,750
I'll ask my father to help.

523
01:04:57,416 --> 01:04:59,458
Don't take the trouble, Ms. Rumpoey.

524
01:05:00,208 --> 01:05:01,958
I'm just a peasant.

525
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:04,375
I don't want to stain

526
01:05:05,333 --> 01:05:06,833
your father's reputation.

527
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:09,583
What are you talking about?

528
01:05:10,208 --> 01:05:13,375
You're in trouble because
you tried to protect my honor.

529
01:05:13,458 --> 01:05:14,583
Am I right?

530
01:05:16,958 --> 01:05:18,541
I'm grateful for that.

531
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:24,125
You're in trouble again because of me.

532
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:30,708
You're going home now, aren't you?

533
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,000
Let me take you there.

534
01:05:36,833 --> 01:05:38,250
I don't have a house.

535
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:40,583
I stay at a temple.

536
01:05:41,791 --> 01:05:44,125
Get in the car, then. I'll take you there.

537
01:05:52,458 --> 01:05:54,458
Please get in, Dum.

538
01:06:14,666 --> 01:06:17,083
What are you planning to do now?

539
01:06:19,625 --> 01:06:22,083
Tomorrow I'll go back to Suphan Buri

540
01:06:22,625 --> 01:06:24,166
and help my father on his farm.

541
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,291
So we'll never
see each other again, right?

542
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,500
Dum,

543
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,458
when we were children,

544
01:06:42,958 --> 01:06:44,583
I made you a promise.

545
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:47,125
If you come to Bangkok,

546
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,875
I'd take you to Bang Pu. Remember?

547
01:06:54,583 --> 01:06:56,833
Mr. Mun! Drive to Bang Pu.

548
01:06:56,916 --> 01:07:00,041
-Ms. Rumpoey!
-Pardon me, miss?

549
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:02,666
I said, "Go to Bang Pu."

550
01:07:02,750 --> 01:07:05,666
-You mean right now, miss?
-Yes.

551
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:09,541
But the master…

552
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:12,291
Do you want to go to Bang Pu

553
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:13,375
or quit your job?

554
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:23,791
LOVE IS LIKE A RAGING BULL
YOU CAN'T PULL IT

555
01:07:23,875 --> 01:07:28,833
AND LOVE CAN ROAM FREE
NO NEED TO GET A PERMIT

556
01:08:11,750 --> 01:08:14,625
So this is the beautiful ocean.

557
01:08:15,375 --> 01:08:17,833
No wonder people long for it.

558
01:08:17,916 --> 01:08:20,750
It's like the edge of heaven itself.

559
01:08:20,833 --> 01:08:22,375
When I was a child,

560
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:25,291
each time my father brought me here,

561
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,625
I was surrounded

562
01:08:28,125 --> 01:08:32,416
by happiness, complete and boundless.

563
01:08:33,625 --> 01:08:37,291
So much happiness
I couldn't hold it all at once.

564
01:08:38,875 --> 01:08:39,833
I remembered

565
01:08:40,333 --> 01:08:42,625
praying that it would last forever,

566
01:08:43,541 --> 01:08:45,208
just like that,

567
01:08:45,875 --> 01:08:48,541
every day and every night.

568
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:50,750
But when I grew up.

569
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:53,291
I found out

570
01:08:54,208 --> 01:08:56,291
time never stands still.

571
01:08:56,375 --> 01:09:00,083
Especially, happy times
as it goes by fast.

572
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:03,208
It comes like a fresh sweet breeze.

573
01:09:03,833 --> 01:09:06,750
Pauses for a moment, then passes on by.

574
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:08,500
Dum,

575
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:13,000
why must we grow up to be adults?

576
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:15,833
Growing older just brings sorrow.

577
01:09:16,875 --> 01:09:18,916
It seems life

578
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,958
is just a long and terrible sadness.

579
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:25,083
And so we must hunger
and chase after happiness,

580
01:09:25,625 --> 01:09:28,125
the smallest hope of reprieve,

581
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:32,000
until the very end of our days.

582
01:09:35,875 --> 01:09:37,000
Ms. Rumpoey,

583
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:42,833
tomorrow I must leave you

584
01:09:45,333 --> 01:09:48,791
though my heart rebels

585
01:09:49,958 --> 01:09:51,666
because I want to be with you.

586
01:09:53,125 --> 01:09:54,625
For the past ten years,

587
01:09:56,208 --> 01:09:57,666
you alone

588
01:09:58,958 --> 01:10:00,833
have dwelt in my heart.

589
01:10:03,375 --> 01:10:07,166
And each time I play the harmonica,

590
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,333
I see no other image

591
01:10:12,125 --> 01:10:13,458
but your face before me.

592
01:10:16,250 --> 01:10:17,541
If this is so,

593
01:10:19,291 --> 01:10:21,041
why did you try to push me away

594
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:24,458
when we met?

595
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:29,333
Because when we met,

596
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,166
my heart was wounded.

597
01:10:34,083 --> 01:10:37,291
I knew I'd never be worthy

598
01:10:38,458 --> 01:10:42,000
of someone high-born as yourself.

599
01:10:45,041 --> 01:10:46,458
It was impossible

600
01:10:47,666 --> 01:10:49,416
to even think about it.

601
01:10:50,541 --> 01:10:52,333
That's not true, Dum.

602
01:10:56,125 --> 01:10:57,125
I…

603
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:03,458
I love you. Do you hear me?

604
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:05,333
I love you…

605
01:11:08,625 --> 01:11:11,083
-More than anything in life.
-Rumpoey…

606
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,458
Rumpoey…

607
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:38,166
Can you promise me you'll wait for me?

608
01:11:41,041 --> 01:11:42,166
I promise.

609
01:11:43,541 --> 01:11:45,083
No matter how long,

610
01:11:46,166 --> 01:11:47,541
I'll wait for you.

611
01:11:54,625 --> 01:11:57,708
What if your father won't permit it?

612
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,625
Then I'll run away with you.

613
01:12:07,416 --> 01:12:10,958
Dum. Do you remember
the "Awaiting the Maiden" pavilion?

614
01:12:12,500 --> 01:12:14,125
The day my father

615
01:12:15,041 --> 01:12:17,208
rejects our marriage…

616
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:20,166
is the day I'll be there.

617
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:21,916
Remember it, Dum.

618
01:13:08,166 --> 01:13:09,208
Father!

619
01:13:20,583 --> 01:13:23,500
Father!

620
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:28,875
Who did this to you?

621
01:13:31,416 --> 01:13:33,333
Kong, the village headman…

622
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:36,125
Kong? Why?

623
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:38,333
Why would he do this?

624
01:13:39,625 --> 01:13:43,208
He wants to replace me
as a district chief.

625
01:13:43,291 --> 01:13:45,708
He came as a bandit…

626
01:13:46,583 --> 01:13:47,791
Kong!

627
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:50,041
I'll kill your whole clan!

628
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:55,125
Father!

629
01:13:56,208 --> 01:13:58,625
Father!

630
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:42,958
Look at me!

631
01:14:50,375 --> 01:14:51,375
Come on!

632
01:15:19,416 --> 01:15:21,625
Hey! He's in the tree. Shoot him!

633
01:16:50,541 --> 01:16:51,666
Little brother,

634
01:16:52,333 --> 01:16:54,125
how are you related to Dua?

635
01:17:04,541 --> 01:17:06,750
Dua saved my life once.

636
01:17:06,833 --> 01:17:09,333
I gave him this gun!

637
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,416
This gun is powerful armor!

638
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,250
No outlaw gang would dare oppose it.

639
01:17:14,333 --> 01:17:15,666
Kong, you bastard.

640
01:17:16,333 --> 01:17:19,625
You dared to rob and kill my friend Dua.

641
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:21,875
Today

642
01:17:22,583 --> 01:17:26,000
you'll taste the same pain.

643
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,500
Ms. Rumpoey, you've troubled
to visit me! I'm so happy!

644
01:18:38,541 --> 01:18:40,375
Don't worry.

645
01:18:40,958 --> 01:18:43,375
I'll get better for our wedding.

646
01:18:47,583 --> 01:18:49,458
You may not believe it,

647
01:18:50,041 --> 01:18:51,666
but I survived

648
01:18:52,541 --> 01:18:54,083
because of you.

649
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:58,583
Remember your photo that I brought

650
01:19:00,791 --> 01:19:03,833
as my good-luck charm?

651
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:06,791
It really did save my life.

652
01:19:07,583 --> 01:19:10,208
After Fai captured me,

653
01:19:11,083 --> 01:19:14,333
he sent the Black Tiger to kill me.

654
01:19:15,916 --> 01:19:18,041
When I knew I'd die soon,

655
01:19:18,708 --> 01:19:20,666
I asked him as my last request

656
01:19:21,208 --> 01:19:22,791
to inform you.

657
01:19:23,958 --> 01:19:26,291
Then I showed him your photograph.

658
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:29,458
When he saw it,

659
01:19:29,958 --> 01:19:33,125
he had a sudden change of heart,
and spared me.

660
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:36,583
It was truly a miracle.

661
01:19:41,083 --> 01:19:42,208
Rumpoey,

662
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:45,583
don't forget our wedding day.

663
01:19:47,083 --> 01:19:49,916
I'll pray the nights
and days rush by until then.

664
01:20:03,166 --> 01:20:05,625
Die! He has to die.

665
01:20:06,750 --> 01:20:08,083
Nobody

666
01:20:08,958 --> 01:20:10,750
walks over me

667
01:20:12,041 --> 01:20:14,625
and gets away with it.

668
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,500
Not even the police.

669
01:20:19,875 --> 01:20:21,875
I'll follow him and kill him.

670
01:20:28,750 --> 01:20:31,708
Mahesuan, tell Dum our plan.

671
01:20:35,333 --> 01:20:36,541
Two days ago,

672
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:40,250
I sent a man
to spy on Captain Kumjorn in the city.

673
01:20:41,750 --> 01:20:42,958
He said that

674
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:45,083
this Sunday,

675
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:48,208
the captain's to marry
the Governor's daughter.

676
01:20:50,208 --> 01:20:52,666
The wedding
will be at the Governor's palace.

677
01:20:53,625 --> 01:20:55,291
When the wedding day comes,

678
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:58,250
I'll ambush them

679
01:20:59,666 --> 01:21:01,625
just as they did me.

680
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:06,458
Fai, I don't agree with the plan.

681
01:21:08,125 --> 01:21:09,333
Why?

682
01:21:10,041 --> 01:21:12,208
The wedding will be packed

683
01:21:12,291 --> 01:21:14,583
with police from all over the province.

684
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:15,750
Good!

685
01:21:16,375 --> 01:21:18,375
I'll kill them all at once.

686
01:21:18,458 --> 01:21:21,291
-It's too dangerous.
-Danger?

687
01:21:21,375 --> 01:21:22,916
I love danger!

688
01:21:24,291 --> 01:21:26,875
Besides, they won't expect us

689
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:29,541
to attack them in their own lair.

690
01:21:30,500 --> 01:21:32,375
They'll be totally unprepared.

691
01:21:34,333 --> 01:21:36,541
I'm dying to see the look on their faces.

692
01:21:37,333 --> 01:21:39,750
-But, Fai…
-Enough, Dum!

693
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:42,583
No more opinions.

694
01:21:43,208 --> 01:21:44,708
I've made up my mind.

695
01:21:46,666 --> 01:21:49,083
You two go to see Guronsan.

696
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:52,458
Buy as many weapons as you can.

697
01:21:55,041 --> 01:21:56,416
On Sunday night,

698
01:21:58,208 --> 01:22:01,083
we'll level the place.

699
01:22:23,208 --> 01:22:24,458
My darling Dum,

700
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:26,583
from here

701
01:22:27,291 --> 01:22:29,708
to the ends of the universe,

702
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:32,666
happiness calls

703
01:22:33,541 --> 01:22:36,041
but once in every life.

704
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:40,291
Let mountains tumble into seas,

705
01:22:41,166 --> 01:22:43,625
let bodies turn to ash,

706
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:46,375
my love for you remains

707
01:22:47,041 --> 01:22:49,583
until I breathe no more.

708
01:24:18,625 --> 01:24:20,333
Oh, my god! Miss…

709
01:24:20,916 --> 01:24:23,083
Miss! My little miss!

710
01:24:23,708 --> 01:24:27,291
Miss! Why are you doing this?

711
01:24:27,375 --> 01:24:28,875
Let me go, nurse.

712
01:24:31,083 --> 01:24:32,416
Just let me die.

713
01:24:50,708 --> 01:24:53,625
Let's try this coffee. I made it myself.

714
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:01,583
You'll be glad to have it.

715
01:25:02,250 --> 01:25:03,208
How was it?

716
01:25:03,291 --> 01:25:04,875
This tastes like dirt!

717
01:25:04,958 --> 01:25:06,250
Typical for a stolen one, right?

718
01:25:07,583 --> 01:25:09,250
No, you can't have that.

719
01:25:10,291 --> 01:25:11,208
Hey!

720
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:14,041
Where the hell is Dum?

721
01:25:27,791 --> 01:25:29,500
Dum!

722
01:25:30,166 --> 01:25:31,416
Dum!

723
01:25:32,125 --> 01:25:34,791
Help me!

724
01:25:34,875 --> 01:25:36,416
Help me! Dum!

725
01:25:37,333 --> 01:25:38,375
Dum!

726
01:25:38,458 --> 01:25:40,541
-Mahesuan!
-Dum! Look out!

727
01:25:40,625 --> 01:25:42,291
What are you doing?

728
01:25:42,375 --> 01:25:45,708
Drop the gun or your pal's dead.

729
01:25:46,208 --> 01:25:48,041
They've betrayed us!

730
01:25:48,708 --> 01:25:50,916
Dum, get out of here!

731
01:25:51,541 --> 01:25:52,958
Don't worry about me.

732
01:25:53,666 --> 01:25:55,000
I said drop the gun.

733
01:26:17,750 --> 01:26:20,375
I never thought the great "Black Tiger"

734
01:26:21,333 --> 01:26:23,500
would fall for a trick like this.

735
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:28,291
Mahesuan you cunning fox!

736
01:26:28,375 --> 01:26:31,166
You robbed the tiger of his teeth!

737
01:26:34,166 --> 01:26:37,208
Mahesuan! What does this mean?

738
01:26:40,625 --> 01:26:42,083
It means

739
01:26:42,833 --> 01:26:45,541
Fai ordered me

740
01:26:45,625 --> 01:26:47,666
to set you up.

741
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:48,833
Fai?

742
01:26:49,333 --> 01:26:50,166
Yes.

743
01:26:50,916 --> 01:26:54,625
He doesn't trust you anymore,

744
01:26:55,791 --> 01:26:57,375
he thinks you're a spy

745
01:26:58,125 --> 01:27:01,500
since you let Kumjorn get away.

746
01:27:02,125 --> 01:27:04,291
How did he know about it?

747
01:27:05,333 --> 01:27:07,000
I told him myself.

748
01:27:07,875 --> 01:27:09,500
I opened his eyes.

749
01:27:10,333 --> 01:27:12,791
Fai lost his way
the day he started trusting you.

750
01:27:12,875 --> 01:27:14,250
You know?

751
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:19,125
I used to be his right-hand man.

752
01:27:20,333 --> 01:27:21,708
But after you came along,

753
01:27:22,625 --> 01:27:24,416
I was treated like a dog.

754
01:27:25,541 --> 01:27:26,791
I've waited patiently

755
01:27:28,333 --> 01:27:29,750
for this day.

756
01:27:30,791 --> 01:27:33,250
It's payback time!

757
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:36,250
Mahesuan, you're traitor!

758
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:38,166
Remember your oath

759
01:27:38,791 --> 01:27:41,083
in front of the Buddha?

760
01:27:42,083 --> 01:27:44,041
-You treacherous dog!
-And you?

761
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,916
You betrayed us all!

762
01:27:48,416 --> 01:27:50,625
Don't you remember Fai's law?

763
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:53,833
Whoever betrays Fai

764
01:27:54,708 --> 01:27:55,541
must die!

765
01:27:59,583 --> 01:28:01,166
But before you die,

766
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:04,583
I'll tell you something

767
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,791
to make it sting.

768
01:28:10,458 --> 01:28:11,958
When I'm done

769
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:15,708
with Captain Kumjorn this Sunday,

770
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,125
the Governor's daughter,
the one you "love,"

771
01:28:21,833 --> 01:28:23,458
I'm going to make her my wife!

772
01:28:49,416 --> 01:28:53,291
You're just a nameless corpse, Dum.

773
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:18,291
You filthy animal!

774
01:29:46,875 --> 01:29:51,791
RUMPOEY RAJASENA

775
01:30:59,291 --> 01:31:02,458
Let me wish you great happiness

776
01:31:03,208 --> 01:31:05,333
and the brightest future.

777
01:31:06,333 --> 01:31:11,083
May love flourish until you're old,
gray, and walking with sticks.

778
01:31:45,333 --> 01:31:48,041
I wish you both

779
01:31:48,541 --> 01:31:50,083
a happy life.

780
01:31:56,291 --> 01:31:58,875
-Dum!
-Black Tiger!

781
01:32:17,458 --> 01:32:18,458
Captain,

782
01:32:19,166 --> 01:32:22,458
Fai plans to ambush your wedding tonight.

783
01:32:23,791 --> 01:32:25,125
Be warned!

784
01:32:26,833 --> 01:32:29,166
Wait! That's the Black Tiger.

785
01:32:29,250 --> 01:32:32,333
-Arrest him! Quick! Halt!
-Don't…

786
01:32:35,041 --> 01:32:38,708
-Arrest him! Help me!
-Quick! Follow me!

787
01:33:17,208 --> 01:33:19,458
Why aren't the bride and groom

788
01:33:19,541 --> 01:33:22,708
taking the first dance, huh?

789
01:33:22,791 --> 01:33:24,541
Why are you just standing here?

790
01:33:24,625 --> 01:33:26,375
Go!

791
01:33:26,458 --> 01:33:28,833
Don't be shy. Just go.

792
01:33:28,916 --> 01:33:30,125
Go!

793
01:33:50,541 --> 01:33:51,791
I never imagined

794
01:33:52,833 --> 01:33:55,208
the Governor's daughter…

795
01:33:56,208 --> 01:33:58,958
would consort with
a scum like the Black Tiger.

796
01:34:01,416 --> 01:34:04,500
Rumpoey, you still haven't told me

797
01:34:05,833 --> 01:34:07,916
when have you befriended him!

798
01:34:11,416 --> 01:34:12,416
Or…

799
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:16,708
is there something more intimate?

800
01:34:17,250 --> 01:34:18,875
Why did you protect him?

801
01:34:20,125 --> 01:34:22,041
Rumpoey! Answer me!

802
01:34:24,916 --> 01:34:28,458
Captain, when will you

803
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:30,708
believe me?

804
01:34:31,791 --> 01:34:35,000
I didn't know he was the Black Tiger.

805
01:34:39,333 --> 01:34:40,625
You didn't?

806
01:34:42,416 --> 01:34:45,541
But you called him like a close friend.

807
01:34:46,166 --> 01:34:47,875
You never knew, huh?

808
01:34:51,208 --> 01:34:52,208
I…

809
01:34:53,541 --> 01:34:55,333
Can see it in your eyes.

810
01:34:57,666 --> 01:35:00,708
They say exactly how you feel about him.

811
01:35:05,083 --> 01:35:07,291
If you won't believe me,

812
01:35:07,375 --> 01:35:09,000
I can't do anything.

813
01:35:19,791 --> 01:35:22,333
-Everyone got envy.
-I agree with you.

814
01:35:23,583 --> 01:35:26,875
Hey! Lucky guy! Take it easy!

815
01:35:27,833 --> 01:35:29,416
You'll get drunk.

816
01:35:30,541 --> 01:35:31,750
I want to get drunk!

817
01:35:51,333 --> 01:35:52,541
Oh, nurse.

818
01:35:53,416 --> 01:35:55,041
I feel so sorry for him.

819
01:35:56,875 --> 01:35:58,916
It must have hurt him

820
01:36:00,083 --> 01:36:01,791
to see me changed.

821
01:36:04,041 --> 01:36:06,541
I broke my promise to him.

822
01:36:09,708 --> 01:36:11,708
It's fate.

823
01:36:11,791 --> 01:36:14,166
You can't prevail against it.

824
01:36:14,250 --> 01:36:16,541
And he's an outlaw!

825
01:36:22,708 --> 01:36:25,666
What kind of life could you have with him?

826
01:36:31,000 --> 01:36:32,083
In this life,

827
01:36:33,833 --> 01:36:35,791
I'll never love another.

828
01:36:37,250 --> 01:36:39,416
Only him, always.

829
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:44,916
So that's the reason.

830
01:37:46,166 --> 01:37:47,208
I get it now

831
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:50,083
why Dum released me.

832
01:37:51,375 --> 01:37:52,666
He did it for your sake.

833
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:56,666
How stupid am I?

834
01:37:58,916 --> 01:37:59,958
The Black Tiger.

835
01:38:01,458 --> 01:38:03,833
That robber is luckier than me.

836
01:38:03,916 --> 01:38:06,416
He has your heart to himself.

837
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:11,166
Rumpoey,

838
01:38:12,416 --> 01:38:13,458
do you know

839
01:38:16,333 --> 01:38:18,333
what I hate most?

840
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:22,916
I hate…

841
01:38:24,750 --> 01:38:26,416
I hate being a loser.

842
01:38:27,375 --> 01:38:28,416
And now I've lost.

843
01:38:30,416 --> 01:38:33,541
I know now I will never own your heart.

844
01:38:38,125 --> 01:38:39,333
But…

845
01:38:42,208 --> 01:38:44,166
I can still own…

846
01:38:44,250 --> 01:38:47,208
-your body!
-Captain, don't!

847
01:38:47,833 --> 01:38:48,666
RUMPOEY RAJASENA

848
01:39:40,250 --> 01:39:43,416
-I heard you got promoted.
-The news spread fast, doesn't it?

849
01:39:43,500 --> 01:39:46,625
Then let me salute you, sir!

850
01:40:28,375 --> 01:40:30,083
Hey! That was gunfire!

851
01:40:30,166 --> 01:40:32,916
Tigers, attack!

852
01:40:37,125 --> 01:40:38,458
Take positions!

853
01:40:44,291 --> 01:40:45,875
What happened Kumjorn?

854
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:47,791
Fai's attacking, sir.

855
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:50,750
It's safer if you stay up here.
I'm going down to fight them.

856
01:40:50,833 --> 01:40:53,166
No way! I'm coming with you.

857
01:40:53,250 --> 01:40:55,458
They dare to attack me here.

858
01:40:55,541 --> 01:40:58,333
I'll show them who I am. Go!

859
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:16,000
Sakon, how many of them?

860
01:41:16,083 --> 01:41:18,041
No less than 50.

861
01:41:18,125 --> 01:41:20,333
Call the barracks for reinforcements!

862
01:41:20,416 --> 01:41:21,416
Okay.

863
01:41:26,416 --> 01:41:27,541
Sakon!

864
01:41:46,750 --> 01:41:47,750
Don't move!

865
01:41:49,416 --> 01:41:52,083
Well, what a peach!

866
01:41:52,916 --> 01:41:55,333
-No wonder Dum's obsessed.
-Don't you touch her.

867
01:41:55,416 --> 01:41:58,291
-You beast! What are you doing?
-Get out, you old hag!

868
01:41:59,000 --> 01:42:00,208
Or die.

869
01:42:01,291 --> 01:42:02,458
Move!

870
01:42:02,541 --> 01:42:04,750
-Don't do it!
-Come here!

871
01:42:04,833 --> 01:42:06,583
-Don't! Help!
-You old hag!

872
01:42:12,041 --> 01:42:15,375
-Help!
-No one's going to help you.

873
01:42:15,458 --> 01:42:16,958
Dum's gone to hell already.

874
01:42:53,708 --> 01:42:54,916
Well, Captain…

875
01:42:55,708 --> 01:42:58,458
-It's all over now.
-Fai.

876
01:42:59,583 --> 01:43:01,208
You won't get away.

877
01:43:01,291 --> 01:43:03,375
All the police in Suphan Buri
are on their way.

878
01:43:04,500 --> 01:43:05,500
I know.

879
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:09,458
But before that,

880
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:12,083
you'll be a ghost by then.

881
01:43:13,708 --> 01:43:15,750
Get ready to meet your death.

882
01:43:51,583 --> 01:43:53,791
Don't you recognize an old hoodlum?

883
01:44:12,875 --> 01:44:14,291
Dum!

884
01:44:15,208 --> 01:44:17,875
-So you're still not dead!
-Mahesuan.

885
01:44:19,166 --> 01:44:20,583
Let Rumpoey go!

886
01:44:21,916 --> 01:44:23,208
Let's settle this

887
01:44:23,791 --> 01:44:25,333
man to man.

888
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,083
Sure!

889
01:44:28,541 --> 01:44:30,333
I want to know

890
01:44:31,916 --> 01:44:32,916
who's faster.

891
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:35,708
You or me?

892
01:47:18,583 --> 01:47:19,791
Freeze, Black Tiger.

893
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:24,375
Put Rumpoey down slowly.

894
01:47:24,958 --> 01:47:26,333
Don't try anything!

895
01:47:56,500 --> 01:47:57,500
Dum.

896
01:48:20,583 --> 01:48:21,875
Don't!

897
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:32,208
Dum!

898
01:48:39,500 --> 01:48:40,625
Dum!

899
01:49:51,666 --> 01:49:53,375
It seems that life

900
01:49:53,875 --> 01:49:56,125
is just a long and terrible sadness.

901
01:49:57,041 --> 01:50:00,500
And so we must hunger
and chase after happiness,

902
01:50:00,583 --> 01:50:03,000
the smallest hope of reprieve,

903
01:50:03,791 --> 01:50:06,791
until the very end of our days.

904
01:53:18,250 --> 01:53:22,125
THE END
