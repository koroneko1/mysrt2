00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.600
1931, 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.000
5 Chinese merchant families in Siam were running their businesses successfully

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.000
they gathered up to form Five Dragons Association

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.000
and they became the most influential association in Siam, economically.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
The absolute power and decision of the association

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.000
was in the palm of the leader's hand which was Song Family,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.000
and he was elected by the members of five families.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
The association leader position will be succeeded to the first son of Song Family. 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:36.000
If any heir of successor ruined association's reputation,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:43.000
the members could fire that successor and elect the new heir.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.000
Song Family Residence

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
5 Dragons' Meeting.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Bring them to the guests, carefully.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.000
It will be a key meeting of Five Dragons Association.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.000
Don't ruin it, you hear that?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Yes, ma'am. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Mom? Can I go out and play? It's so boring in here.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
You have to stay here / Sure.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Where's my big brother?

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000
He's praying to the gods. If everyone is here, I'll go get him.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000
I'm sorry for welcoming you late.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Say hi to mister and Xiaotong.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
What are you talking about?

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.800
We're discussing about coffee that the association will import.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Who will take care of it?

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Shun and I both agreed that Zhang should take care of it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Well, congratulations is in order then.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.000
Maybe it could be different from everyone's expectation.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Because our big brother hasn't assigned this task to anyone yet. 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.000
In my opinion,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000
I think I'm more suitable for this position than you.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Miss Chan?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Please continue talking, excuse me.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Bua! What the hell are you doing here?

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You know that they're hosting a party and you're rushing here?

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.000
You're just a mistress, you should know your place.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000
I'm about to head to the market, I need to use this path.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.000
I didn't even know that they hosted a party up there.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
You're going to the market? Can I come with?

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.000
I won't let you. Why did you want to go with her?

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Fine. Then I'll go play somewhere else. / Stop it. 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.600
If there is nothing else, I need to be excused. 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.000
She said that she wanted to go to the market and used this path.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.000
Actually, she wanted Mr.Song to see her.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:01.000
So he would think of her and go to see her, right?

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Yang! 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Bring him to play somewhere else, don't let him be around here. 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.000
The adults are talking about something important. 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Let's go, Tian. 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:39.000
Why can't my son and I get in?

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.000
When you and your son can get in.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
My son and your son are different.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.000
My son is the first son, he will be the successor of our husband

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.000
and he will succeed the leader position in the association.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:05.000
Your son is the second son, he is minor choice of this family.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Li, you scum dancer! I really hate her.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.000
I hate her too. Actually, the female head of the house

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:37.000
should belong to you. 

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.000
You're a daughter of aristocrat.

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.000
You're superior to her.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000
I was here a little later than her.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000
So I was the second place and she could push me to the ground.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Yang was born just one night after Tian.

00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:59.800
That's quite upsetting. If only he had been born just a little bit earlier,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
he'd have been the first son and the successor of the family. 

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Just let it go, we can't change it.

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.000
The second wife like me and my son

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000
will take everything from her and her son.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.400
Take a look at all of them,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
these people, they are significant people of the association.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
That one is Mr.Sung. He's the owner of the biggest ferry business in Bangkok.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000
That one is Cai Xiaotong. She's the leader of Cai Family.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:50.000
After her husband passed away, she is taking care of tea house business.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000
The last two people are Mr.Ma and Mr.Zhang.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Mr.Ma is operating rice mill business

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000
and Mr.Zhang is taking care of agricultural products' import and export.

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:08.000
And distributing the products to various big provinces.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000
Everyone is gathering here today

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
to elect either Mr. Ma or Mr. Zhang, who will take care of coffee 

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:20.000
that the association will import.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Look at Tian. He is frowning. He doesn't understand any of this.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000
I need to tell him all of this.

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000
You may not understand about this now but you need to learn about it.

00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:42.000
Because you will be the leader of Song Family in the future. 

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
And you will be the leader of Five Dragons Association after your father. 

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Mr.Song is coming. 

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000
The meeting is about to start. You should go outside and play. 

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
And don't make any noises around here. 

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.000
The adults will discuss something important. Understand?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000
I called all of you here today

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000
to hear the decision of who will take care of coffee import business.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.500
And I decided that the most suitable one is…

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.500
Zhang.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Why did you let Zhang to take care of it? I am the one contacting this. 

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000
This job requires someone who is careful and detail-oriented. 

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:53.000
I made a decision and Zhang is the most suitable one for this job. 

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Please take care of this. 

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Thank you for trusting me. 

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Congrats. 

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:19.000
It's alright. I knew that you would let Zhang to take care of it. 

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.000
But I want you to make another decision.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000
About what?

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Let me go / Get out

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:41.000
Let me go. I didn't do anything. 

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000
Poj? Ma,what did you do to my people?

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Tell him what is your relationship with Poj?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.000
What do you mean?

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Hey! 

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Stop!

00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Are you okay?

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Tell him what is your relationship with Poj?

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Speak! Tell him.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000
What is it?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Zhang is homosexual.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
What is homosexual?

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:46.000
I don't know.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.000
Homosexual? 

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.000
What is it?

00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Homosexual? 

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:06.000
You like men?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000
How did you know that he is one?

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:21.000
This is a lover letter of Zhang and Poj, his lover. 

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Sir? Please don't mix this with business.

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:44.000
I run the business successfully. I've never made any mistakes. 

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Don't judge me based on my personal preferences. 

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.000
Why can't we? What if someone knew about this

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:54.000
what would people look at us?

00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:58.000
You are the one ruining the association's reputation, you take advantage of people

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
You use your power to harass people. Don't you think I didn't know any of this.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000
You can talk whatever you want but where's the proof?

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000
How can we let a homosexual run the business? There's only one way to fail.

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.000
Please bring me justice.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.000
It's me who're asking for justice.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000
There's a homosexual in the association. Who would want to partner with us?

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.000
You ruined the reputation. This is humiliating. 

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:34.300
Stop. That's enough.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:44.000
Ma, you will take care of imported coffee business.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Thank you for the justice. 

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000
You are judging me like this?

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:57.000
I've dedicated everything for the members because we're family. 

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Just because I'm a homosexual

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.000
and you let a gangster like Ma taking care of the business instead of me?

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:13.000
When the association opened Chinese opera house or sewing business, you can take care of that. 

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.800
You should go home. We’ll talk later.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.000
I'm not going back. Let's talk here. 

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000
I've been working for Five Dragons Association my whole life.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Now I know that it was useless. I shouldn't have respected you. 

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000
You're closed-minded and you're unfair.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:44.000
You're a homosexual, you love men. 

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
You have to work on something that is more suitable for you,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000
not the business that required good image like this.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
What if the outsiders knew about this, what would happen to the association?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
It's not just about you.

00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.000
It's about our brothers and sisters here.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.000
In your opinion,

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000
me being a homosexual is that disgusting?

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Fine. When all of your hearts are all close-minded,

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
I won't be here anymore.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:29.000
If you're serious about this, you should remove Zhang Family out of the association.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Fine. Listen to me carefully.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:45.000
From now on, Zhang Family won't be a part of Five Dragons Association.

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:50.000
We will take over all of your businesses.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Sir?

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
I lost my respected siblings

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000
it doesn't matter if I have to lose my business either.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000
From now on, it will be only four families in the association,

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000
and it is just a doomed association.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.000
Shut your mouth and go home.

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:26.000
Don't make me sadder than this.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Please, I beg you.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.000
Don't judge him like this. I beg you.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.000
Let go of his hand.
Please don't judge him like this

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.000
I told you to let go of his hand.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:42.000
That's enough.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Let's go home.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000
Tian and Yang, come here.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:22.000
What're you looking at? Stop it, come here.

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Stay here, please. 

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.000
Why did they have to hurt that man?

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.000
I don't know either. 

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.600
Maybe he did something really bad. 

00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.000
Tian and I heard that the abused man is a homosexual.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.000
What is a homosexual?

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.300
I…I don't know either.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.000
Why don't you ask someone who knew more about this?

00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:56.000
I think we should get out of here.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:57.800
Come on,

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
That's Pao. He should know about this. Let's ask him.

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:05.000
Wait! Tian! Yang!

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000
What is a homosexual?

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:11.000
Where did you hear it from?

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Did you play where the adults were discussing?

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.000
So what does it mean?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000
The Mandarin word of this literal translated as "the passion of the cut sleeve"

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
It was started from the old days.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Emperor Ai of Han

00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:35.000
was a handsome emperor but he never cared for any women.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
But he fell in love with a man named Dong Xian

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
he's a royal page in a palace.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
And he had to pretend to be eunuch so he could work closely to the emperor.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.000
They were passionately in love

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
One day, after falling asleep for a nap on the same bed, Emperor Ai&nbsp;

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
saw his lover was still asleep on his sleeve.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000
So he cut off his sleeve rather than disturb the sleeping Dong Xian 

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
when he had to get out of bed. So his lover could sleep comfortably.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:16.000
People use this word to refer to a man who loves another man.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Or we called them gay.

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:22.600
I don't understand any of this / Right.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:28.000
You don't have to. Homosexual is taboo. It is forbidden and it's not good.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000
If they want someone to accept that, no one would be sympathized.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.000
And no one would feel empathy for them. 

00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:38.000
Why do they need anyone to feel empathy for them?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.000
It's about two people who have the same feeling, regardless of gender.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000
They should be able to choose happiness in their lives, shouldn't they?

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000
About Zhang, I think…

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000
You think I was too harsh on him?

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
I didn't say that you were too harsh but this is sensitive. 

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:32.000
You should think it through. You're brothers. I feel bad for him.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Do you think that I don't feel bad for him?

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:44.000
Among all the members in the association, I love him and adore him the most and you know that.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:51.000
This is not personal. If I was too soft on him and acting like nothing happened,

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:56.000
Ma could call me out.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:04.000
And what Ma said was right. What if the outsiders knew about this,

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
the businesses in the association would be shaken. 

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Everyone will be in trouble. 

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000
I agreed to cut him off because of everyone.

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000
What about this? When everything is cooling down,

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000
and everyone is calming down…

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Sir? Something bad happened.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Zhang? Why did you come back?

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:07.000
You gave me this money when we arrived in Siam,

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:15.000
we swore to be brothers, to help one another and to start business together.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Now I gave it all back to you. We're done.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000
Don't disappoint me than I already am. 

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
I disappointed in you too.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000
It was hurt that Ma called me out but it was nothing compared to being banished by you.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:43.000
You judged me like we used to be in tough time together.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000
I shouldn't have love and looked up to you. I see you as my own father. 

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000
If you see me as your father,

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
you need to understand me. 

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000
You know how much we struggled to develop

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000
the association to become this successful.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000
If anyone knew that you're a homosexual, everyone's business will be ruined.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000
It's not just about you.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000
I know that I'm a homosexual.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
But you're my brother,

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
you acted like I'm someone else just because I'm not a real man.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000
No matter how much you tried to say.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
I can't take back my own decision.

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.000
I'm not here to persuade you to change your mind.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
I know. No matter how well I'm trying. 

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000
I can't be greater than the real man like you or Ma.

00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000
But I want you to remember this. 

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Even though I'm a homosexual, 

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000
I have dignity and I respect myself.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.000
I'm not here to beg you.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
But I'm here to revoke our promise

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:50.000
that I gave to you that we'll be brothers for life. 

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Watch out!

00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.000
Don't do anything.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Zhang!

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:28.000
Zhang! 

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Chan! 

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Zhang! 

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000
You should be the one who brought justice to me,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000
but you didn't have any mercy on me.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:00.000
One day, I wish you feel the same pain that I feel.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Then you will understand how I feel.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Zhang!

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Zhang!

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:21.000
Madame! 

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Zhang!

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
I shouldn't be the leader

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
if I can't take care of my brother like this.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:47.000
If I hadn't pushed him, he wouldn't have done this.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Don't blame yourself. Zhang decided to end his own life.

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:02.000
You have done your best.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Please organized the best funeral for him.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
He's one of us.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Rest in peace, and please forgive us.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.800
I couldn't sleep last night.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000
The image of Zhang cut his throat still haunted me.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
His ghost will be haunted for sure.

00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.000
The blood stain on the floor can't be washed off. 

00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:03.000
How could it be?

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.000
It's a blood of someone who died with agony. 

00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:08.000
Someone who didn't have any justice.

00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:12.000
That's right. He must be furious and full of rage before he died.

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:15.200
I don't know who would receive his curse. 

00:32:15.300 --> 00:32:18.000
Who do you think? He spoke it out loud like this.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:24.000
If the boss had been softening up on Zhang,

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.000
this wouldn't have happened. 

00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:30.000
This is so sad. He said that everyone is family

00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.000
they struggled together when they came from China. They helped one another.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000
When he knew that Zhang did something that he didn't like

00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:41.900
he didn't accept Zhang and pushed him to commit a suicide. 

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000
You were gossiping about the deceased. You think that's appropriate?

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:52.000
I don't want to hear anyone talk about this ever again. 

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Let loosen up a little. You should feel better after watching the performance

00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.000
so you won't think about it.

00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:53.000
In Ermei valley,

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:06.000
there was Baisuzhen 

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Baisuzhen was a white snake.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:42.000
But she was meditating for thousands of years

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:49.000
so she transformed into a human.

00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:36.000
I'm Baisuzhen, a beautiful white snake. I was meditated so I could transform to be a human

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
What are you doing?

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
You're acting as the leading actress of a live soap opera?

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Nice. Can you perform for me? I want to watch it.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000
You want to watch it?

00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.000
Sure. Come on, I wanna see.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:41.000
A white snake named Baisuzhen was meditated for a thousand of year and she traveled to human's world.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Faith brought her to meet with Qiqiang and they fell in love.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:59.000
It's a forbidden love among demon and human. It's a hopeless type of love.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Then I was trapped alone in Leifeng pagoda.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000
What's next?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000
That's all I saw they performed. If you want to know more, you have to watch the next performance.

00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:28.000
Then we should go watch they perform together.

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:33.000
But I'm hungry, let's find some snacks at Bua's house / Sure.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000
Let's go / Let's go.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Don't run or you'll fall. Wait for me.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
You're too slow.

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:48.000
Wait for me here. I'm gonna get some snacks at Bua's place.

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.000
I'll go with you.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:54.000
No need to. I should go there by myself. You're too slow, you can't keep up with me.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:15.000
Where's Yang? I want him to study and he keeps on missing.

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:18.000
He could be with Bua or playing with Tian.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:24.000
He's good at disagreeing with me. Why does he like to hang out with someone I hate?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Watch out! 

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Bring a stick to move it.

00:38:34.100 --> 00:38:36.000
No! I'm scared. 

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Me and snake? Which one do you scare more?

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.000
Fine / Come on.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000
Be careful.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000
What should we do?

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:54.000
Get it somewhere else.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.000
Tian? Throw it over there. 

00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:04.000
Will it bite Tian? I could be in trouble.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Good! So he would die and this would end.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Chan! 

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Sir? 

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Yes, sir?

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Yes, sir. 

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000
What're you doing?

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Nothing. 

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000
What're you doing here? Normally, you would be at the warehouse by the pier. 

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:56.000
I have a headache so I come back here to rest. 

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
You're still thinking about Zhang?

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:04.000
Let's go inside. I'll give you a massage so you'll feel better. 

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Let's play. Bua'll bring us drinks and snacks. / Sure.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Watch out! 

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I'm scared.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Be careful.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Tian! What's wrong? Please be okay.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Help! 

00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.000
What's going on?

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Tian! Yang!

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.000
How was it?

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.600
I took care of what you ordered.

00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:27.000
Good. Let's see if the snake bit Tian to death.

00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:28.000
Sure. 

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:34.000
Lead the way. Help!

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.000
Dad! Mom! Please help.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Help! Please hang in there. 

00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:43.000
Help! 

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Hang in there. / Tian?

00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:47.000
What happened?

00:41:47.100 --> 00:41:48.000
What's wrong with him?

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.000
Tian was bitten by a snake. 

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Tian? Please be okay. 

00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.000
Hang in there, honey. 

00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:56.000
Sir? 

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Get the car. I'm taking him to the hospital. Come on. 

00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.000
Please be okay. 

00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:03.300
You have to be okay. 

00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.000
Hang in there, Tian. 

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Hey! 

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000
That's bad. 

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Where's the car?

00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:36.000
We're in trouble. All tires are flattened.

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:39.000
Flattened tires? How could it be possible?

00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:41.300
I don't know. It was normal in the morning.

00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:44.000
If it was normal, then it needed to be working.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.800
Get me the car. I'm taking Tian to the hospital, come on! / Yes,sir.

00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:52.100
Hang in there, Tian.
Please be okay, Tian.

00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:57.000
You have to be okay, honey. Don't fall asleep.

00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:03.000
I'm here. Please hang in there. You have to stay strong. 

00:43:03.100 --> 00:43:04.000
Chan! 

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Sir?

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:14.000
You have to flatten the tires. / Yes, ma'am.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:32.900
Please be okay. 

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000
You poor thing. He's still young.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Wake up! Come on, wake up!

00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Stay strong. Hang in there. 

00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:03.000
We're taking you to the hospital, hang in there.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Oh my goodness!
Tian!

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Tian! Tian! 

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Give this to Tian.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Wait! I don't know what it is. He can't take anything randomly, what if he's dead?

00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:44.900
Why can't he? Jia has been an assistant to the family's doctor of this family for years.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.300
She's good with herbs too.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:49.800
Also, I'm sure that if it was dangerous,

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.000
Jia wouldn't risk giving it to Tian.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Sir? / Come on.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Tian.

00:44:57.100 --> 00:45:02.000
Tian. Do you hear me? Stay strong.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.000
You have to be safe. You hear me? 

00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.000
Tian!

00:45:09.100 --> 00:45:14.000
Hang in there, Tian!

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:16.300
Tian!

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Tian!

00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:19.000
Tian! / Tian!

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Jia! 

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:25.000
Tian! 

00:45:25.100 --> 00:45:26.000
Tian!

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Tian!

00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Dad? Mom? / Tian.

00:45:32.200 --> 00:45:34.000
He's awake.

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:35.000
He's awake.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:40.000
How're you feeling?

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Its venom was released.

00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:47.000
His leg would be sore but don't worry. It'll get better in a few days.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Tian is feeling better. Hang in there! 

00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:57.000
You're okay. You're fine, now.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Thank you for saving his life.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
You can punish me anything you want

00:46:27.100 --> 00:46:29.000
but please don't fire me.

00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:31.000
You dare to show your face here?

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.000
You failed at take care of my cars. My son almost dies.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:42.000
You're the female boss here. I assigned you to take care of workers in the building.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.000
You should take care of this. 

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Sir? Please.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.400
I don't know how it happened. 

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000
But I swear I take care of every car very well. 

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000
If you took the best care, how could it happen? Don't ask for mercy.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.700
Tian is the first son of this family. 

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
He will succeed everything from Mr.Song.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:12.000
If something happened to him, how could you be responsible for that?

00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:15.000
Pack your things and get out of here. 

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:21.000
Please calm down, Jia. You should go. 

00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:22.000
Yes, ma'am. 

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
How could you be calm down when he…

00:47:32.100 --> 00:47:38.000
Don't you think it's weird that every car got flattened tires?

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:55.000
That's too bad. Tian was close to death already.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
It's all because of Jia, that nosy bitch. 

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:03.000
She brewed some sort of herbs so he got better. 

00:48:03.100 --> 00:48:04.000
That's right. 

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Madame? Why were you here all of a sudden?

00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.000
Where were you when Tian was bitten by a snake?

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.800
I was with Mr.Song. When I went outside, 

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:26.600
I saw Bua carried Tian. What's wrong?

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:32.000
You're gonna accuse us of releasing snake to bite him?

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
What about you?

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.000
I'm with my boss. 

00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:45.000
What do you think about all the cars got flattened tires?

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
I don't know about that. I don't know much about cars.

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Someone in the house must do that.

00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:58.000
There's only you who wish my son to die. 

00:48:58.200 --> 00:49:01.900
You can't accuse me like that. You have any proof?

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000
If you have any, then you should press charges against me. 

00:49:05.700 --> 00:49:10.000
But be careful. People could say that

00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:14.400
you're delusional and blaming people around.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.000
I'll find the proof for sure. If I can find out that you did this,

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:24.000
you should be prepared to get consequences. 

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:29.000
And remember. Don't ever think about harm Tian

00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:33.000
or I'll take it out on both you and your son, harmfully. 

00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Sir?

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000
I'm here to thank you for saving Tian.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
If you hadn't carried him to the building, he could have been worse for sure.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:13.000
You don't have to thank me.

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:16.600
I love him like my own son. If he's in trouble, I have to help him.

00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:22.000
Did you have any idea why the cars got flattened tires?

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
I asked Li to take care of that.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:30.000
What do you think this was all about?

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:35.000
I don't think it was an accident for sure.

00:50:35.200 --> 00:50:38.000
But it's hard to find the proof of who did this.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:45.000
How's Madame? She must be worried about Tian.

00:50:45.300 --> 00:50:48.000
She must be worried sick about this.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
You care about everyone.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:58.000
Tian and Madame are good to me. Of course, I'm worried about them.

00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000
I am the only one who hasn't been good to you.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Please go back to stay in the building with me.

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000
I won't.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
You're still mad at me?

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:28.000
I gotta admit that I was furious at you back then.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.300
You had a doctor to check on me. When you found out that I was sterile,

00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:38.000
you told me to leave the building, like I was nothing.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
I'm sorry.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:50.000
But you don't have to worry. I get it now.

00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:56.000
Every woman is valued, even though we can't have any children. 

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:02.000
We shouldn't let anyone judge us, just because we are sterile.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:15.000
I was wrong. I wasn't thinking. I hurt your feeling.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:30.000
It's getting late you should go back.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
I'm not going back tonight. I'm spending the night here.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Yang?

00:53:25.200 --> 00:53:27.000
How're you? Are you hurt?

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Just a little bit. What did you do? Your face is dirty.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:42.000
I climbed up the tree to get it. I know that you like it. 

00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Thank you for saving my life / Sure.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:56.000
When will you get better? It's not fun playing by myself. 

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Many days. It's ashamed that I can't go to see the live soap opera performance.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000
What about this? When you get better or when we're growing up,

00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:10.000
I'll take you to see every live soap opera performance. Sounds good?

00:54:10.100 --> 00:54:11.200
You promise?

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:23.000
I promise.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.000
This guava looks nice.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Here's some snacks.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Thanks.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:05.000
If you had me a child, our relationship wouldn't have been like this.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Even if I had a child,

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:17.000
I wouldn't want my child and I to fight for anything with anyone,

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:24.000
and I wouldn't want my child to be in danger, like…

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:26.000
Like Tian yesterday.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:31.000
I'm upsetting that I had no proof.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000
But you know who did this?

00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000
I have something to ask you.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.000
Tian and Yang are so close

00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.000
they stay together since they were so young.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.000
I don't want their mothers' conflict 

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:56.000
to get in the way of siblings' love.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
I understand what you're trying to say.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:03.000
I don't want to hate Yang.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000
But the bonding of mother and son is much stronger than sibling's bond.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:16.000
I don't know what Chan taught Yang.

00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:22.000
But I hope that when time passed

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Tian and Yang would continue to be loving siblings like this. 

00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Your wound is drying. You'll be able to walk soon. 

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Yang? Come on in. 

00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000
You're here to play with Tian?

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:13.000
That's right. I want to draw with Tian. His leg hurt and he can't go out to play. 

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Please take care of him.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Sure. Tian, let's draw. 

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Let's go. 

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.000
But…

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.900
Why did you let Tian with Yang?

00:57:47.000 --> 00:57:49.300
You know that Chan hates Tian so much. 

00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:53.000
She could teach her son to hate Tian and hurt him too. 

00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:57.000
You should have split both of them to be more distant. 

00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.000
It's enough for me to fight with Chan.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Yang is Chan's son

00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:08.000
but he shares the same blood as Tian. Their bond won't break.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:16.000
It'd be better for them to love each other than hate each other, don't you think?

00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:34.000
It's all done. 

00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:35.600
Thank you. 

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Be careful!

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Please wait for me, I'll get one for you. 

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.900
You haven't been here for days. How's your wound?

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000
It's getting better. 

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
What's going on?

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000
I don't want a sword. Can I get something else?

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
What do you want?

00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:16.000
Can you get me a hairpin?

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
A hairpin? / Yes.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000
It's all done. Do you like it.

00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:44.000
I like it. It's so pretty.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:26.000
Tian, I brought you some snacks.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Tian!

01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Tian!

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.000
What did you do?

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Why did you wrap your head with scarf like this?

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
Where did you get it?

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Bua made it for me. She made this beautiful thing for me. 

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
This is bad. Tian starts to be like Mr.Zhang. 

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Tell me, how often do you act like this? Has anyone seen you like this?

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Tian? / Ouch!

01:01:53.300 --> 01:01:59.000
Listen to me. You can't do this again. You hear me?

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:00.000
Ouch! 

01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:06.000
Listen to me. What you did was forbidden in this house. 

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:10.000
If you continue to be like this, you will have nothing. 

01:02:10.300 --> 01:02:14.000
What you have will be taken from you. 

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.000
I forbid you to not do this again. You hear me?

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
I'm here. 

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Ms. Chan.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Don't. 

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000
Don't cry. Burn it. 

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000
It's mine. 

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
What did she do?

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:35.800
Don't / Tian!

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Don't / Stop! 

01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Listen to me. You can't let anyone know this secret. You hear me?

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:49.000
If someone knew about this, you would be in trouble for sure. You hear me?

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Ms.Chan?

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Come on, it's about to burn all of this.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Come on.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000
So hot. / Hurry up.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000
I got it.

01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.600
What the hell?

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
They said it was a secret.

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:26.000
A secret?

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.800
A fabric and a stick?

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:34.000
They said if anyone knew about Tian's secret, it would be a big trouble.

01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:36.000
Tian's secret?

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:44.800
It must be something important and wicked.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Otherwise, Madame and that old hag wouldn't be too serious about this. 

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
I need to know about this secret. 

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Tian? 

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
I heard you said that the old one was ruined, so I brought you the new one.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Why did you look like that? This one is not as pretty as the old one?

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:30.600
It's pretty. But I can't play with it. 

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:37.000
What happened?

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:48.000
It's okay if you don't want it. 

01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.000
I'll get you something to eat. 

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.000
Where are you rushing to?

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000
I'm going back to my room. 

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:34.000
Don't go. Let's talk, what did you and your mom burn last night?

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:39.000
I saw you cried. 

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Did your mom force you to do something?

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
You can tell me so I can help you. 

01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Tian hides something behind his back. 

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:03.000
What is that? Can I see? Let me see. 

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Nope / Come on, let me see it. 

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:08.000
Nope / Nuan, help me.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:11.700
Please let me see that. 

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.800
Nope / Let me see it. 

01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:14.000
Nope / Let me see. 

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.000
Show it to me. 

01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:19.000
Nope. 

01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:21.000
Please give it to me. 

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:27.000
How dare you hurting him!

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
How dare your people hurt mine?

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000
What did you do?

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
I didn't do anything.

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.000
I saw he walked so I just came to say hi.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000
But he acted weird so I came to talk to him.

01:08:05.100 --> 01:08:10.000
He was fighting me and then she came in.

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:14.000
You liar! Normally, you didn't even want to look at my son's face.

01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:16.000
Why would you want to play with him now?

01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:21.000
My son was bitten by a snake and every car got flattened tires.

01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:25.000
I questioned you but I couldn't do anything because I had no proof.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:29.000
Today, I saw with my own eyes that you hurt my son.

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000
I confirmed that I didn't do anything to him,

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:38.000
including the snake, the car or what happened today.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
If he hadn't act weirdly,

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000
I wouldn't have questioned about him and got involved. 

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Or something happened?

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000
Does he have a secret to hide?

01:08:56.000 --> 01:09:02.000
That's enough. And you, don't mess with Tian anymore.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000
You can just raise your son to be a good man and that should be enough.

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000
You hear me?

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Yes, sir. 

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:33.000
I told you not to play with this. Why didn't you listen to me?

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:37.000
Please don't scold him. He was scared. 

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:40.000
If he was scared, he wouldn't have done something like that. 

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000
Get up. I told you to get up. 

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000
Get up. Now! 

01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:01.000
When I forbid you and you didn't listen to me, then it'd be a punishment, you hear me?

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Fold your arms over your chest and turn around. 

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Madame? Why were you here all of a sudden?

01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Don't do that again.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:28.000
Didn't I tell you that if someone knew about this, you'd be in trouble?

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:37.800
Remember! You have to listen to me. 

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.300
Remember that!
Please stop, please.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:47.000
He could be dead. Please, stop. 

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:12.000
12 years later.

01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Tian!

01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:33.300
Tian!

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.000
Tian!

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:37.000
In memory of Tangmo Pattaratida (Nida) Patcharaveerapong.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Damn it.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.000
Please bring me justice. 

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.000
Who're you?

01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000
You've been working so hard and you should get some rest already.

01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.800
I want to rest too.

01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:03.000
According to the custom, Tian needs to get married and have children to continue the family. 

01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:13.000
I need to know the truth before Tian accepts the position.
