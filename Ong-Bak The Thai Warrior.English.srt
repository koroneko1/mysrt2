1
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,875
Quiet, please!

2
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:49,333
The winner this year is young Ting!

3
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:04,666
Welcome, people of Nong Pradu,

4
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:08,416
and all who have come for the presentation
of robes to our revered Ong-Bak.

5
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:13,208
Ong-Bak provides us with moral support

6
00:05:13,375 --> 00:05:16,916
during this ceremony.

7
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,666
I'd like to tell you that
the great festival of Ong-Bak

8
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,625
will commence here in seven days,

9
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:28,875
which is held only once

10
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:32,165
every 24 years.

11
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:39,041
It marks the start of
another cycle of good fortune.

12
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,916
Where's the amulet?

13
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,625
It's quite damaged

14
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,166
and there's a mark on its head.

15
00:06:01,166 --> 00:06:02,375
Hardly perfect condition.

16
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,500
It's worth around 200,000,
which is not bad.

17
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,291
Why won't you just sell it?

18
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,750
All right. Name your price.

19
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,666
-Don, it's not for sale.
-What?

20
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,791
Why not?

21
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,791
I came all the way from Bangkok,
I took time off work.

22
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:26,666
I didn't promise you I'd sell it.

23
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,708
I'm keeping it for my son

24
00:06:30,208 --> 00:06:33,083
for when he decides
to become a monk for Ong-Bak.

25
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:38,916
Just give me a call
if you change your mind.

26
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,166
No. I don't have a phone.

27
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,333
You can take my address.

28
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,916
If you need that money,
you can send me a letter.

29
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:05,083
Isn't it beautiful, Granny?
I'll make Ting wear it.

30
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,791
Yes, it is.

31
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:13,041
Ting's birthday is on the same day
as Ong-Bak's ceremony, isn't it?

32
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,208
It is.

33
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,458
He's such a poor guy.

34
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:23,750
He was left at the temple
when he was a baby.

35
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,458
The senior monk found him,

36
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,500
so he decided
to adopt him as his son.

37
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:36,458
Anyway, he seems like
another version of Ong-Bak.

38
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,041
The front kick.

39
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:47,416
The back kick.

40
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,583
A jab with a kick.

41
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,958
The double uppercut.

42
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:53,541
Knee up to defend.

43
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:55,958
Kick backward and then uppercut.

44
00:07:56,916 --> 00:07:58,000
Flying knee.

45
00:07:58,625 --> 00:07:59,708
Forward elbow.

46
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,291
Backward elbow.

47
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:03,541
Elbow attack on thigh.

48
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:05,291
Upward elbow.

49
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,458
Flipping elbow.

50
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,333
Elbow cross.

51
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,166
Elbow swing.

52
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,250
Elbow swing and knee up.

53
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:16,708
Defend and push.

54
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:19,291
Knee uppercut.

55
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,250
Flying knee.

56
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,708
Elbow upward.

57
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:26,208
Elbow and back kick.

58
00:08:27,125 --> 00:08:28,000
Elbow forward.

59
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:29,708
Punch and elbow.

60
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,000
Elbow and knee defend.

61
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:32,707
Cross elbows.

62
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:49,167
I have taught you the art of Muay Thai.

63
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:53,582
Now I ask you never to use it.

64
00:08:54,207 --> 00:08:57,832
Do you understand why, Ting?

65
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,542
I do, sir.

66
00:09:00,292 --> 00:09:01,250
Good.

67
00:09:10,707 --> 00:09:11,625
Good for you.

68
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:15,500
You don't really understand, do you?

69
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:17,250
Right?

70
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,042
Before he became a monk,

71
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:30,957
your master
learned Muay Thai martial arts

72
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:33,167
from Master Dam's book.

73
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:39,582
He was eager to test his skills,
so he fought in a street fight.

74
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:44,917
He killed his opponent.

75
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:48,207
He was overcome with guilt...

76
00:09:49,707 --> 00:09:50,792
so he became a monk.

77
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:53,332
Muay Thai is extremely dangerous.

78
00:09:55,332 --> 00:09:59,625
He doesn't want you
to walk the same path he did.

79
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:01,207
Got it?

80
00:10:03,667 --> 00:10:06,875
You still have doubts, don't you?

81
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:10,457
Fine. Fight me.

82
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:13,292
-Ting.
-Uncle.

83
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:51,750
Motherfucker!

84
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,332
What the hell are you doing?

85
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:05,792
Quick!

86
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,207
Don.

87
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:21,417
He's the one who cut
Ong-Bak's head off.

88
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:29,417
Take the donation money
and bring the statue's head back.

89
00:11:31,042 --> 00:11:35,000
Don, you son of a bitch!

90
00:11:36,667 --> 00:11:42,625
Without Ong-Bak's head
our village is doomed!

91
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:45,832
Calm down, people.

92
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:50,875
We have to find a way
to bring Ong-Bak's head back

93
00:11:51,042 --> 00:11:54,457
before the grand ceremony.

94
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,957
Who's going to bring it back?

95
00:12:01,292 --> 00:12:02,707
I'll bring it back.

96
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,457
I know where Don lives.

97
00:12:10,582 --> 00:12:15,582
The people of Nong Pradu's
fate lies in your hands.

98
00:12:17,292 --> 00:12:19,750
This amulet provides spiritual protection.

99
00:12:20,917 --> 00:12:25,707
My grandfather told me
it belonged to Master Dam.

100
00:12:26,207 --> 00:12:28,125
You should keep it with you.

101
00:12:34,417 --> 00:12:36,207
Here's Don's address...

102
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,250
and a letter.

103
00:12:39,582 --> 00:12:41,332
Please give it to my son.

104
00:12:42,332 --> 00:12:45,750
Bring Ong-Bak back, son.

105
00:12:47,207 --> 00:12:48,917
For the village's sake.

106
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:02,250
Take my money.

107
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:06,917
My hope goes with you, son.

108
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:12,042
My mom gave me this ring
before she died.

109
00:13:13,832 --> 00:13:15,667
Wan, take good care of Granny.

110
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:40,582
Everyone give what you can.

111
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,082
For the journey.

112
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:23,082
Damn! I lost the bet.

113
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:29,042
Hey! Hey!

114
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:34,582
Damn it!

115
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:36,625
Come here, Bus.

116
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:40,375
Who's the loser you brought
to join the race?

117
00:14:40,707 --> 00:14:42,750
Hey! What're you talking about?

118
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:44,667
It's normal to win or lose a race.

119
00:14:44,792 --> 00:14:46,582
How can you say that?

120
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:49,667
You brought a girl?

121
00:14:50,082 --> 00:14:52,250
So?
What's wrong with me being a girl?

122
00:14:52,417 --> 00:14:55,625
Bitch. Do you know who I am?

123
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,875
Shame you don't race
as fast as you talk!

124
00:14:59,082 --> 00:15:00,457
Jerk!

125
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:03,167
Hey!

126
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:16,792
Hey!

127
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,957
-You're not paying me in cash?
-You bet with some crank.

128
00:15:20,832 --> 00:15:24,250
You told me that it's
either crank or cash.

129
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:27,500
Yeah.

130
00:15:35,667 --> 00:15:36,832
I'll give you ten grand.

131
00:15:37,417 --> 00:15:39,707
The other ten grand
is security for your debts.

132
00:15:40,457 --> 00:15:43,917
I pay you interest every month
and it's not due yet.

133
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,207
Can't you just give me that money?

134
00:15:46,957 --> 00:15:48,582
-Take it or leave it.
-Hey!

135
00:15:48,917 --> 00:15:50,332
It's better than nothing.

136
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,167
Give it back.

137
00:16:04,082 --> 00:16:05,000
Give it to me.

138
00:16:08,207 --> 00:16:09,500
You got your money.

139
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,125
Just give my boys some crank,
will you?

140
00:16:12,417 --> 00:16:17,082
You can find it anywhere you want.
You don't need that.

141
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:21,000
My crank's too strong.

142
00:16:21,332 --> 00:16:23,292
Your boys can't handle it.

143
00:16:23,832 --> 00:16:25,500
-Trust me.
-Hey!

144
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,457
Son of a bitch!

145
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:51,541
Yes! My bro, George, is back.

146
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:54,457
Come on, give me some money.
Give me my share.

147
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:56,792
Quick. I'm in a hurry.

148
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,832
We were caught in the act.

149
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:02,082
Peng knew our crank was fake.
He took all the money.

150
00:17:03,082 --> 00:17:07,166
What? Don't joke with me.
It's not funny, man.

151
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,500
Look. Look at my face.

152
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,541
You think I did this to myself? Bitch!

153
00:17:16,708 --> 00:17:17,625
What's that for?

154
00:17:17,958 --> 00:17:19,041
It's swelling!

155
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,416
-Can't help it. What did you do?
-Fuck it.

156
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:25,250
Do you have some cash?

157
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:28,916
What the hell! I lost my share,
and now you want some cash from me.

158
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,666
Look, Muay.

159
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:34,125
You always take your share from me.

160
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,833
Just give me some.

161
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:41,000
You're the one who got caught.
That money was in your hands.

162
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,416
I'm stupid, huh?
You're a fucking genius.

163
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:46,875
What should we do now?
Peng's given me three days.

164
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:50,166
If I can't pay him back, I'm dead.
I'm in trouble!

165
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,583
Humlae!

166
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,083
Is that you, Humlae?

167
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:58,666
Hello.

168
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,833
Muay, is he your friend?

169
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:03,458
-Do you know him?
-What do you mean?

170
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:05,416
He called your name, didn't he?

171
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,708
You know this hillbilly?

172
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,333
Do you recognize me?

173
00:18:09,666 --> 00:18:11,708
-I'm Ting from Nong Pradu.
-Hey!

174
00:18:11,958 --> 00:18:15,125
I don't know you, redneck.

175
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:18,333
Got it? I don't know a redneck like you.

176
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,250
But I recognized you, bro.

177
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:21,916
I'm not your fucking bro!

178
00:18:22,583 --> 00:18:25,374
Who's Humlae? Sounds horrible.

179
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,666
Don't call me that or I'll beat you up.

180
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:30,083
Stop teasing him, Humlae.

181
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:32,499
No. Sorry, George.

182
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:35,333
You're such an annoying bitch.

183
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:37,458
Get out of my face.

184
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:40,750
Come on.
Where are you from again?

185
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,291
-Nong Pradu village.
-Right, Nong Pradu.

186
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:49,165
Right, I'll leave the Nong Pradu boys
to it! You'll have lots to talk about.

187
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,458
None of your business.

188
00:18:52,125 --> 00:18:54,541
Go away and give me some cash.

189
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,208
Here. For your painkillers.

190
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,250
-Right.
-See you, Humlae.

191
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:06,458
You, redneck,
go back to your stupid village.

192
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:11,083
Humlae, your dad gave me a letter for you.

193
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,375
I said I don't know you!

194
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:20,833
This is my apartment.

195
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,000
You're not offended, right?
Close the door.

196
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,416
Mosquitos.

197
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:27,625
I was a little upset...

198
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,375
and in a bad mood.

199
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,458
Humlae.

200
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:34,208
Well...

201
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,541
Do you know that our village
is in a big trouble?

202
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,916
Don and his men
cut Ong-Bak's head off.

203
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:47,375
Your father told me
to find you

204
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,166
so we can get the head back.

205
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,624
I have Don's address.

206
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:56,166
No more talking.
You drop your things here

207
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,500
and take a shower. Go.

208
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,708
Take a shower first, come on.
Right here.

209
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:01,833
That's the shower.

210
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,125
Go on. Go.

211
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,624
Can we go and find him?

212
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:07,208
No. Shower first.
Use this towel. Go.

213
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:08,833
Go. I'll turn on the light for you.

214
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:12,375
Go. The soap is on the left,
a toothbrush is on the right.

215
00:20:12,666 --> 00:20:15,166
No jerking off all over the floor, okay?

216
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,833
Hello, Muay.

217
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,958
Yep. Meet me on Khaosan Road.

218
00:20:21,416 --> 00:20:23,375
At the underground boxing. Yeah.

219
00:21:06,875 --> 00:21:08,041
Can I make a bet?

220
00:21:08,625 --> 00:21:09,833
Is it too late?

221
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,375
Sure.

222
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,083
All in.

223
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,291
Hey! That's right.

224
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,166
Exactly. That's right.

225
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,041
Yeah. Right.

226
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,333
Where's the amulet
you talked about?

227
00:21:30,791 --> 00:21:34,583
Well, the stupid owner
refused to sell.

228
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:38,791
So I got Ong-Bak's head
for you, boss. Here.

229
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:43,125
The villagers worship this.
It's the village's sacred statue.

230
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,416
It's obviously damaged.

231
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,000
Why did you bring it to me?

232
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:55,166
You want to upset me?

233
00:21:56,416 --> 00:22:01,958
Throw this crap away
or I'll be really upset.

234
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:12,041
Your boys keep letting you down today.

235
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,458
Now watch your Pearl Harbor

236
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,958
get the kamikaze treatment
from my boy, Ali.

237
00:22:18,125 --> 00:22:19,375
Your boy is totally done.

238
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:55,708
I have no money.

239
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,666
I'm trying to make some.

240
00:22:58,166 --> 00:22:59,375
I didn't come for money.

241
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:01,458
I can make a living on my own.

242
00:23:02,875 --> 00:23:04,375
Now you're a drug dealer?

243
00:23:06,083 --> 00:23:07,000
Yeah.

244
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,874
You're so confident about your boy.

245
00:23:14,958 --> 00:23:15,833
Right.

246
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:19,833
If you think your boy can win,
up the stakes as much as you want.

247
00:23:20,583 --> 00:23:21,833
I have no limits.

248
00:23:21,958 --> 00:23:24,458
Don't say a word.
You don't know me.

249
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:28,958
One asshole
can make you a slut, huh?

250
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,208
Muay, you're not my mom!

251
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:36,250
Of course not. Mom wouldn't
let you to behave like this.

252
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:40,750
Right. A slut like me
has taken care of you.

253
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:43,791
From now on, a good girl like you
can just leave me alone.

254
00:23:52,875 --> 00:23:54,833
Let me know if you want anything.

255
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,291
Get up! Get up!

256
00:24:40,458 --> 00:24:41,375
Next.

257
00:24:42,416 --> 00:24:44,000
If you're still up for it,

258
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,208
just let me know
if you want to raise the stakes.

259
00:24:55,958 --> 00:24:56,916
Fuck you!

260
00:24:57,723 --> 00:25:00,473
He has won three fights in a row.

261
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,708
Hey!

262
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:06,708
Where's our people's money?

263
00:25:06,916 --> 00:25:08,000
What money?

264
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:10,541
-My money pouch.
-I have no idea. It's not me.

265
00:25:11,708 --> 00:25:12,791
Over there.

266
00:25:12,916 --> 00:25:15,750
He's won three times in a row.

267
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,166
Three times in a row, people.

268
00:25:19,291 --> 00:25:20,666
Who's next?

269
00:25:23,791 --> 00:25:28,375
The next opponent.

270
00:25:29,208 --> 00:25:30,500
BETS ON 3-1

271
00:25:30,625 --> 00:25:35,208
Put your bets on!

272
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:38,958
What?

273
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:42,041
What's that redneck
doing in the ring?

274
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,000
Right. You're dead, Ting.

275
00:25:46,875 --> 00:25:48,416
I give you ten to one.

276
00:25:50,291 --> 00:25:51,875
I don't think
you should bet on this.

277
00:25:53,416 --> 00:25:56,291
Fine. I'll give you a million
if you dare.

278
00:25:58,583 --> 00:25:59,625
Deal.

279
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:01,583
I'm not here to fight.
I want my money.

280
00:26:02,666 --> 00:26:05,375
Easy, dude.
I'll find your money.

281
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,416
Fight!

282
00:26:31,291 --> 00:26:32,708
What's your name, bro?

283
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:34,541
I'm Ting from Nong Pradu.

284
00:26:35,083 --> 00:26:36,000
I'm gonna...

285
00:26:36,291 --> 00:26:39,375
Ting, Pradu's Pride.

286
00:26:53,208 --> 00:26:54,125
I'm not taking it.

287
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:56,500
I just want my money pouch back.

288
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,666
What an idiot.

289
00:27:08,333 --> 00:27:10,000
Wait. Wait.

290
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:12,708
Why didn't you take that money?
Are you that stupid?

291
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:16,875
Let me know if you want to fight.
You're great.

292
00:27:17,291 --> 00:27:18,583
I can tell you, if you win

293
00:27:18,958 --> 00:27:21,666
you'll have lots of money.
You'll be rich.

294
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:23,500
I don't fight for money.

295
00:27:24,416 --> 00:27:28,208
Humlae, why did you steal
the villager's money?

296
00:27:28,291 --> 00:27:29,958
I didn't steal it. I invested it.

297
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,625
When we're rich
I can help you find Ong-Bak.

298
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:36,458
-Will you help me?
-Sure.

299
00:27:40,166 --> 00:27:41,458
This is Don's address.

300
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:42,833
Please take me there.

301
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:45,625
Keep it. I'll take you there later.

302
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:48,499
Can I borrow the money?
I need to make an investment.

303
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,249
When I get some extra money,
I'll give it back to you.

304
00:27:51,333 --> 00:27:52,875
I'll take you there for sure.

305
00:27:59,166 --> 00:28:00,083
Go away!

306
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:01,833
Go away, asshole!

307
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,250
You redneck!

308
00:28:03,666 --> 00:28:05,208
I was nice to you, idiot.

309
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:07,958
Where is he going to spend the night?

310
00:28:08,041 --> 00:28:10,125
Fuck it,
or let him stay with you!

311
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,583
You're crazy.

312
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,500
What now?

313
00:28:16,041 --> 00:28:17,250
Peng is going to kill me.

314
00:28:17,666 --> 00:28:18,708
Hey, Muay.

315
00:28:19,125 --> 00:28:21,083
You bring some crank
to Lao's casino, okay?

316
00:28:21,291 --> 00:28:25,125
Then we can share some cash.
I know the owner.

317
00:28:25,333 --> 00:28:29,125
You've just been beaten up.
Want some more, George?

318
00:28:29,250 --> 00:28:31,875
I told you I don't want to
get involved with your crank.

319
00:28:32,208 --> 00:28:33,458
Will you give me a hand?

320
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:35,583
You want me to get beaten up?

321
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Will you?

322
00:28:37,791 --> 00:28:41,500
I'll get the money for you,
but not tonight.

323
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:43,666
That's my girl.

324
00:28:52,416 --> 00:28:54,333
Don't give me your puppy dog eyes.

325
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:57,583
About our shares,
you get 30 and I get 70.

326
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,750
Muay, it's 50-50.

327
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,790
-70-30
-50-50

328
00:29:02,875 --> 00:29:03,875
70-30

329
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:41,375
The money you asked for
for your business in Bangkok,

330
00:29:41,708 --> 00:29:43,333
I can't give it to you right now.

331
00:29:43,791 --> 00:29:46,375
Our village is suffering from
great drought

332
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:49,750
and Ong-Bak's head was stolen by Don.

333
00:29:50,291 --> 00:29:53,875
I want you to help Ting
find Ong-Bak and bring it back.

334
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,541
It's bad luck...

335
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,000
Nonsense.

336
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,250
Wan, the water in the well
is running out. What should we do?

337
00:30:36,333 --> 00:30:40,291
Dear Lord,
please bring Ong-Bak back soon.

338
00:30:40,541 --> 00:30:41,916
Amen.

339
00:30:48,625 --> 00:30:50,458
Yong, you got lots of customers?

340
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:55,666
-Priew, you win?
-I lost, bro.

341
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,208
Hello, bro.

342
00:30:57,708 --> 00:31:00,875
Hello, George.
Where the hell have you been?

343
00:31:01,375 --> 00:31:02,290
Doing my business.

344
00:31:02,375 --> 00:31:04,375
You know my casino
needs more customers.

345
00:31:04,666 --> 00:31:06,708
-Come and help me.
-Not today.

346
00:31:06,833 --> 00:31:08,416
I have plans with my friends.

347
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,041
Shut up. Help me out right now.

348
00:31:10,166 --> 00:31:12,000
-I will, next time.
-No. I said now.

349
00:31:12,208 --> 00:31:13,125
Quick!

350
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,458
Here, take it.

351
00:31:18,791 --> 00:31:21,083
Go away. You're a lame dealer.

352
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:23,250
Right. Bets on.

353
00:31:23,375 --> 00:31:25,083
Uncle, put your bet on.

354
00:31:25,208 --> 00:31:26,624
-What are you waiting for?
-How much?

355
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:28,166
You should be at home.

356
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:30,250
I want some fun before I die.

357
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:34,458
-What you looking at? Fuck off!
-To that table.

358
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,166
Take the dye out of your hair.

359
00:31:37,416 --> 00:31:40,125
Don't copy me!

360
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,458
Here.

361
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:46,833
Bets on, you know.

362
00:31:47,166 --> 00:31:49,791
It's your chance to loose,
not mine.

363
00:31:50,083 --> 00:31:51,041
Don't change your cards.

364
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:53,833
Nine, double.

365
00:31:53,916 --> 00:31:56,416
You have to pay me double.

366
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,665
Next round.

367
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,249
-Bets on.
-Deal the cards.

368
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:03,083
-Call.
-Can I play?

369
00:32:03,750 --> 00:32:06,415
-You have money?
-Three grand. Enough?

370
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,375
Let her play.

371
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:09,708
She might want to lose some.

372
00:32:09,875 --> 00:32:12,208
All her money will be gone
in a sec.

373
00:32:12,333 --> 00:32:13,666
-Two hundred.
-Two hundred.

374
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,416
Here.

375
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,541
Don't you change your cards.

376
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,749
Eight, double.

377
00:32:20,833 --> 00:32:22,958
Pay me.

378
00:32:23,041 --> 00:32:24,708
Give me your money.

379
00:32:24,791 --> 00:32:26,708
Wait, bro.

380
00:32:26,791 --> 00:32:29,291
Nine, double. Pay me.

381
00:32:32,708 --> 00:32:34,000
Make that 400.

382
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,625
Cool, bro.

383
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,250
Put your bet on.

384
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,291
I got six!

385
00:32:42,458 --> 00:32:44,250
I got nine.

386
00:32:48,125 --> 00:32:49,583
I got eight, triple.

387
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:51,958
I got nine, bro.

388
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,333
How can she get those?

389
00:32:56,333 --> 00:32:58,708
She's got some luck.

390
00:32:59,083 --> 00:33:02,583
The odds are in her favor,
I can tell.

391
00:33:03,208 --> 00:33:04,583
Nine points.

392
00:33:04,708 --> 00:33:06,250
What?

393
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:10,208
-Got eight again.
-Got nine again.

394
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:11,875
Fuck you! Here!

395
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,333
Give me more.

396
00:33:13,416 --> 00:33:14,875
-My money.
-Here!

397
00:33:16,916 --> 00:33:18,708
Got eight again.

398
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:21,125
I won.

399
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,625
My money, please.

400
00:33:23,625 --> 00:33:25,333
Eight points again, double.

401
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,041
Nine points. Look.

402
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:28,750
-What?
-Yes.

403
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,625
Everyone, hold your cards.

404
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,416
I need to know
if she's cheating or not!

405
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:41,458
She's only got nines.
I lost to her 15 times in a row!

406
00:33:42,083 --> 00:33:43,291
Is she cheating?

407
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:46,125
I want to prove it this round.

408
00:33:46,875 --> 00:33:51,166
If you get nine again,
you're cheating for sure.

409
00:33:52,208 --> 00:33:57,041
Look, I'll get eight again.

410
00:33:57,625 --> 00:34:01,458
If you get nine again,
you're definitely cheating.

411
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,083
-What?
-You're wrong, bro.

412
00:34:05,458 --> 00:34:06,583
She got four.

413
00:34:06,958 --> 00:34:09,000
-See?
-I can't believe it.

414
00:34:10,291 --> 00:34:12,166
She must be hiding some cards.

415
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,833
-I need to find them.
-Hey, bro.

416
00:34:14,208 --> 00:34:15,666
Easy, bro. I'll take care of it.

417
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:16,708
Check her, George.

418
00:34:17,125 --> 00:34:19,375
You hiding cards?

419
00:34:19,583 --> 00:34:21,083
-I'm not.
-Let me see.

420
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:23,416
I have nothing. No cards.

421
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,373
Look in her pockets.

422
00:34:24,458 --> 00:34:26,375
-I'll do it.
-No need, bro.

423
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,791
Here. Take these and leave.

424
00:34:27,916 --> 00:34:29,416
-Go away.
-No. Look closely.

425
00:34:29,541 --> 00:34:31,291
-Check on her.
-I did. I did.

426
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,208
You, go away.

427
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:36,125
Just go. Don't come back ever again.
Bitch.

428
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:39,250
He makes money every day.
You made him lose.

429
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,458
Come on, bro.
Let's make some money.

430
00:34:41,708 --> 00:34:45,916
How? They've lost their money.
That bitch took it all.

431
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:47,125
Why you mad at me?

432
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,958
We've got eight grand.

433
00:34:49,083 --> 00:34:50,791
Here, three grand for your tuition.

434
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,500
-What? Just three grand?
-Don't spend too much.

435
00:34:55,083 --> 00:34:58,000
-Damn. It's nothing.
-Right. Just take it.

436
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,666
-Don't spend it all.
-Can I have one more grand?

437
00:35:00,875 --> 00:35:02,666
That's enough. Three grand for you.

438
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:03,873
-That's it.
-My tuition.

439
00:35:03,958 --> 00:35:04,833
Hey!

440
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:07,833
You've got a lot of money.

441
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:09,916
That jerk's here.

442
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:12,208
Can I borrow some?

443
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:14,500
That's mine!

444
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,416
I'll take care of it.

445
00:35:16,666 --> 00:35:19,041
I'm about to pay you back.

446
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,458
There you are. Here.

447
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,083
-That's mine.
-What?

448
00:35:24,458 --> 00:35:25,541
Here.

449
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,583
Eight grand.
I'll give you the rest later.

450
00:35:28,916 --> 00:35:31,791
Don't give me that look.
You scare me.

451
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:33,916
I don't care about your debt.

452
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,875
You two made a fool out of me
the other day.

453
00:35:37,375 --> 00:35:38,458
I can't take it.

454
00:35:40,583 --> 00:35:43,666
-Don't hurt me!
-Break his arm.

455
00:35:46,041 --> 00:35:48,166
Ting! Ting!

456
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:51,000
Asshole!

457
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:53,541
Don't hurt me!

458
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,708
Hey!

459
00:35:57,291 --> 00:35:59,041
You betrayed me, huh?

460
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:03,916
Who is he?

461
00:36:11,875 --> 00:36:14,083
It's none of your business, jerk.

462
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,250
You'll regret this.

463
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,541
I'm grateful, Ting. Thanks.

464
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:35,083
I'll help you find Ong-Bak.

465
00:36:37,833 --> 00:36:39,375
Can you fight for me just once?

466
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,291
Wait. Listen to me.

467
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,958
You know that I got beaten up.

468
00:36:47,083 --> 00:36:49,291
If I can't pay him back,
I'm a dead man.

469
00:36:49,458 --> 00:36:52,416
Please help me.
Just once, one last time.

470
00:36:53,208 --> 00:36:54,250
-Easy.
-Okay.

471
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:58,458
Fine. Forget it.
You idiot, all of you.

472
00:36:58,791 --> 00:37:00,958
Screw your stupid village!

473
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:04,958
Sending one guy against a whole gang
to recover Ong-Bak? Crazy!

474
00:37:05,333 --> 00:37:07,875
If Ong-Bak is truly sacred,
how could it be beheaded?

475
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,041
It's just a lump of rock!

476
00:37:11,166 --> 00:37:12,041
Damn you!

477
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:14,750
How dare you?

478
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,041
-You hit me?
-Hey!

479
00:37:16,166 --> 00:37:19,208
-You want to kill him?
-He hit me!

480
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:22,208
Forget it. The one who wants
to kill you is over there.

481
00:37:24,250 --> 00:37:25,375
Peng!

482
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,125
You never learn, do you?

483
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:30,125
Want him to kick your ass again?

484
00:37:33,791 --> 00:37:35,041
You bring the whole gang?

485
00:37:38,791 --> 00:37:39,833
George!

486
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:43,041
You should know by now
what to do.

487
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:48,125
Muay, you know what to do, right?

488
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,375
I'm good at this.

489
00:37:55,125 --> 00:37:58,791
Wait.

490
00:37:59,333 --> 00:38:01,166
Get them!

491
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,958
You follow him.
The rest of you follow me.

492
00:38:26,916 --> 00:38:29,125
-You...
-Goodbye, bro.

493
00:38:54,375 --> 00:38:57,375
Move. Move, asshole.

494
00:38:57,625 --> 00:38:58,708
Hey!

495
00:39:10,041 --> 00:39:11,958
Wow. How did you do that?

496
00:39:18,666 --> 00:39:21,416
My butt is safe.
How could I jump like that?

497
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,250
Hey! Follow him!

498
00:40:12,541 --> 00:40:13,625
Can I borrow this?

499
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,416
One more step
and I'll cut you into pieces, jerks.

500
00:40:31,708 --> 00:40:35,916
Knives! Good knives!

501
00:40:36,416 --> 00:40:39,250
Knives!

502
00:41:13,791 --> 00:41:14,563
CHIILLI FLAKES 10 BAHTS/GRAM

503
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:20,500
It burns!

504
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:41,125
Kill him now!

505
00:42:56,666 --> 00:43:01,916
Damn!

506
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:04,083
Hey!

507
00:43:04,583 --> 00:43:06,000
Hey!

508
00:43:09,583 --> 00:43:11,916
Ting! Help me!

509
00:43:12,083 --> 00:43:14,541
I won't. You're as bad as Don.

510
00:43:14,916 --> 00:43:17,666
Don...
I know where he's at.

511
00:43:17,958 --> 00:43:20,125
Ting! I know where Don is.

512
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:50,458
Who's next? Come on!

513
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,375
I saw Don selling drugs around here.

514
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:56,041
You can ask Muay.

515
00:43:58,666 --> 00:43:59,833
Today we...

516
00:44:00,875 --> 00:44:03,666
What? Damn it!

517
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,291
That guy's here.

518
00:44:17,458 --> 00:44:20,916
If I can find someone to fight
with Big Bear,

519
00:44:22,041 --> 00:44:23,333
you want in?

520
00:44:24,208 --> 00:44:26,916
If you have the guts, I'm in.

521
00:44:27,958 --> 00:44:31,291
Big Bear. Big Bear.

522
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,791
Come on!

523
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,666
Hey! You! Stop it!

524
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:41,125
-Let me.
-You're crazy!

525
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:52,791
Welcome back, champion.
Ting, Nong Pradu's Pride.

526
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,291
-What's that, George?
-That's Big Bear,

527
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,458
he's challenging Ting.

528
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:50,875
Come on. I'll fight you.

529
00:45:51,291 --> 00:45:54,125
I'll teach you some Muay Thai moves.

530
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,458
-You see Don?
-I don't.

531
00:46:24,708 --> 00:46:26,458
I can only see a poor Thai guy.

532
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:28,083
You're such a coward.

533
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:40,458
Are you not gonna help him?

534
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:42,041
If you don't, he'll be dead.

535
00:46:47,458 --> 00:46:48,458
Ting!

536
00:46:53,916 --> 00:46:57,291
If you don't help him,
I'm not gonna help you find Ong-Bak.

537
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:59,833
Just do something. Quick!

538
00:47:00,125 --> 00:47:01,916
Help him first.

539
00:47:42,791 --> 00:47:47,000
Bets on! Bets on!

540
00:47:48,416 --> 00:47:49,708
Bets on!

541
00:47:50,125 --> 00:47:51,416
I'll put my bet on 2-1.

542
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:52,958
What do you say?

543
00:47:53,458 --> 00:47:55,500
I call three million.

544
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:08,666
Front kick to the face.

545
00:48:21,250 --> 00:48:22,750
High kick with knee.

546
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:29,458
If my boy wins,
I'll take the money.

547
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:32,333
Yeah. I know.

548
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,083
That's it?

549
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:19,875
Ting! You're the best!

550
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,000
That's enough, bro.
Let's call it a day.

551
00:50:12,166 --> 00:50:17,041
Ting, Pradu's Pride and Toshiro!

552
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:48,291
Well done. Great!

553
00:50:49,208 --> 00:50:50,791
-Enough!
-One more time.

554
00:50:50,875 --> 00:50:52,291
I just need half of it.

555
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:53,875
-Are you sure?
-Trust me.

556
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,458
-Just half of it.
-Yeah.

557
00:52:39,416 --> 00:52:41,625
Another challenger?
I'll make it even.

558
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:44,250
Fine.

559
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:45,748
Ten million for this.

560
00:52:45,833 --> 00:52:47,375
No problem.

561
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:13,166
Are you all right?

562
00:55:17,208 --> 00:55:19,375
Get off me! Let me go!

563
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:23,458
Ting! Help me!

564
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:08,291
Don't miss this time.

565
00:56:39,083 --> 00:56:42,083
Excellent! Ting! You're the best!
I told you, Muay.

566
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:44,541
All in and we're rich.

567
00:56:44,750 --> 00:56:47,333
You are all stunned.

568
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:49,083
Make it rain. I'm rich!

569
00:57:42,958 --> 00:57:44,791
Muay! Collect them all!

570
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:48,791
That's enough, bro.
You've had no luck today.

571
00:57:51,583 --> 00:57:52,500
He's a mess.

572
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:58,708
Ting, you're so great.
We're going to be rich, Muay.

573
00:57:58,833 --> 00:58:00,333
You're so good.

574
00:58:01,666 --> 00:58:02,583
Don!

575
00:58:06,250 --> 00:58:07,541
Hey! Cops!

576
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,625
Follow him!

577
00:58:13,666 --> 00:58:16,083
Move! Move!

578
00:58:16,166 --> 00:58:17,208
Go!

579
00:58:30,041 --> 00:58:31,916
I'll deliver the stuff on Sunday.

580
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:34,291
Get your men ready for the job.

581
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:37,000
Don't cause any trouble.

582
00:58:37,333 --> 00:58:38,291
Yes, sir.

583
00:58:39,708 --> 00:58:41,458
How do you know that redneck?

584
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,000
-Humlae.
-What?

585
00:58:45,500 --> 00:58:47,250
Where can we find Don?

586
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:49,541
Not now. You eat first.

587
00:58:50,166 --> 00:58:52,000
Don't worry. We'll find him.

588
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:54,500
Everyone here on Khaosan Road
knows him.

589
00:58:55,041 --> 00:58:56,625
Eat. Dig in.

590
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:58,041
Hey! Muay.

591
00:58:58,708 --> 00:58:59,791
You come with me tomorrow.

592
00:59:00,708 --> 00:59:03,333
We may have a way
to make some more money.

593
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:05,500
No. I have a test tomorrow.

594
00:59:05,916 --> 00:59:08,498
What test?
You never go to school.

595
00:59:08,583 --> 00:59:11,416
How can you have a test?
Are you the teacher's pet?

596
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:12,750
Damn.

597
00:59:12,875 --> 00:59:15,291
I'm kidding.

598
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:16,625
You're smart. Smart girl.

599
00:59:17,041 --> 00:59:18,375
Let's eat. Dig in.

600
00:59:23,291 --> 00:59:26,041
Thank you, Humlae,
for helping me find Ong-Bak.

601
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,958
-That's all right.
-If your father knew--

602
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:29,250
George!

603
00:59:29,458 --> 00:59:31,416
You owe me three months' rent.

604
00:59:31,541 --> 00:59:33,125
What you gonna do?

605
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:36,208
Can you give me three more days?

606
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:38,583
Three days and I'll pay you.
I promise.

607
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:42,541
You promise me all the time.
If you don't pay me today,

608
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,416
you can pack up and leave.

609
00:59:45,041 --> 00:59:46,208
Take this ring instead.

610
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:47,916
Fine.

611
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:49,458
I give you seven days.

612
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,333
Get me that money.

613
00:59:52,166 --> 00:59:55,583
If you can't, all of you are out.

614
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:57,083
Got it?

615
01:00:27,833 --> 01:00:33,458
I want you to come back with Ting.
Don't worry about the money.

616
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,375
If you don't want to be a monk,
I won't blame you.

617
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:41,541
All I want is for you come back
to visit me. I miss you.

618
01:01:30,833 --> 01:01:31,750
What?

619
01:01:32,625 --> 01:01:35,500
What's wrong?
I'm not as good as your ex?

620
01:01:40,583 --> 01:01:41,625
You turn me off.

621
01:01:45,458 --> 01:01:46,375
Don.

622
01:01:48,083 --> 01:01:49,708
I'm not smuggling crank for you.

623
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:53,833
Why not?

624
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:03,625
I want to quit.

625
01:02:11,958 --> 01:02:12,958
You want to quit?

626
01:02:16,708 --> 01:02:18,166
You want to quit?

627
01:02:18,541 --> 01:02:19,416
Come here.

628
01:02:22,458 --> 01:02:24,125
You think you can quit easily, huh?

629
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,291
Quit, if you can.

630
01:02:27,791 --> 01:02:29,250
If you can, go ahead.

631
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:30,375
Yeah?

632
01:02:55,666 --> 01:02:56,541
Who the hell?

633
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:09,333
What? Ting! George!

634
01:03:10,416 --> 01:03:11,333
Ting!

635
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:14,833
You!

636
01:03:17,166 --> 01:03:18,958
Ngek!

637
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:21,208
Ngek!

638
01:03:21,333 --> 01:03:23,166
-Where's Ong-Bak?
-No idea.

639
01:03:23,791 --> 01:03:26,708
-You stole it!
-I said I have no idea.

640
01:03:27,791 --> 01:03:28,875
Ting!

641
01:03:29,666 --> 01:03:30,625
Back off!

642
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:36,208
Ngek!

643
01:03:44,041 --> 01:03:46,873
Move! Move!

644
01:03:46,958 --> 01:03:49,541
It's too late. Come on!

645
01:03:50,041 --> 01:03:51,041
Wait for me.

646
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:53,541
Get off! Get off!

647
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:59,333
Call an ambulance. Room 212.
Someone might die. Quick.

648
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:13,666
Hurry! Get in.

649
01:05:21,541 --> 01:05:22,958
Why is he still following me?

650
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:44,791
-Come on!
-Die!

651
01:05:57,958 --> 01:05:58,875
Hey! Ting!

652
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,083
Ting!

653
01:06:05,416 --> 01:06:08,208
Ting! Hit the break.

654
01:06:08,416 --> 01:06:09,500
Hit the break now!

655
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:14,208
My goodness!

656
01:06:30,208 --> 01:06:31,416
Don't lose him. Go.

657
01:06:51,125 --> 01:06:52,291
Hey!

658
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:56,458
-No!
-Stop it!

659
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:42,958
I'm falling, asshole!

660
01:07:49,541 --> 01:07:52,500
Fuck you! I almost died.

661
01:07:57,916 --> 01:07:58,958
Go!

662
01:08:54,832 --> 01:08:55,917
Hey!

663
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:10,500
Remember this,
you need to check every inch of it.

664
01:09:10,917 --> 01:09:13,500
No mistakes at all
and the most important thing is

665
01:09:13,750 --> 01:09:15,957
don't let anyone in. Got it?

666
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:19,750
Damn! He's still following me.

667
01:11:23,875 --> 01:11:24,750
Get in.

668
01:11:28,582 --> 01:11:34,207
The police and Fine Art Department
have recovered many artifacts

669
01:11:34,292 --> 01:11:36,248
submerged in the Chao Phraya River.

670
01:11:36,332 --> 01:11:41,082
This recovery is priceless
as every one of these artifacts

671
01:11:41,832 --> 01:11:47,457
is a national treasure
that will be registered

672
01:11:47,582 --> 01:11:50,875
by the Fine Art Department.

673
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:54,375
Chantana Khunsungnoen,
reporting from the crime scene.

674
01:12:06,207 --> 01:12:09,125
I told you not to cause any trouble.

675
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:13,292
I didn't.
They came to find Ong-Bak.

676
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:16,750
What is Ong-Bak?

677
01:12:18,207 --> 01:12:20,500
The statue's head that I brought back.

678
01:12:21,250 --> 01:12:23,957
This son of a bitch
won't stop bothering me.

679
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:28,500
I lost ten million because of him.
Now he's ruined my business

680
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:30,625
because of that stupid statue?

681
01:12:34,332 --> 01:12:36,500
HOSPITAL

682
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:45,457
I'm sorry, I couldn't save her life.

683
01:12:49,625 --> 01:12:51,542
Ngek! Ngek!

684
01:12:52,375 --> 01:12:55,000
Ngek! Ngek!

685
01:12:55,957 --> 01:12:58,707
You can't just leave me!

686
01:12:59,707 --> 01:13:00,625
Who is she?

687
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:03,498
Muay's big sister.

688
01:13:03,582 --> 01:13:06,250
I'm alone here.

689
01:13:06,375 --> 01:13:08,792
You left me.

690
01:13:09,875 --> 01:13:14,292
I have no one but you.

691
01:13:14,707 --> 01:13:15,667
Muay.

692
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:17,707
Muay.

693
01:13:20,250 --> 01:13:21,167
Here.

694
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:23,667
Ngek left this for you.

695
01:13:26,457 --> 01:13:29,625
FOR MUAY'S TUITION

696
01:13:30,082 --> 01:13:33,957
No! I don't want it.

697
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:36,998
I want nothing!

698
01:13:37,082 --> 01:13:38,582
I need her.

699
01:13:38,957 --> 01:13:43,332
Please don't leave me!

700
01:13:43,957 --> 01:13:46,000
Get over it, Muay.

701
01:13:46,292 --> 01:13:48,792
People die. It happens.

702
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:51,375
I'm not going to leave you.

703
01:13:51,707 --> 01:13:53,246
Hey! What's going on?

704
01:13:53,329 --> 01:13:54,666
Quick!

705
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,666
What're you doing?
I'm not going with you.

706
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:59,498
Quick! Come on!

707
01:13:59,582 --> 01:14:01,917
Let's go!

708
01:14:11,457 --> 01:14:15,082
You played with fire,
you don't know who you're messing with.

709
01:14:16,332 --> 01:14:19,417
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

710
01:14:19,707 --> 01:14:21,167
It's between Ting and Don.

711
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:23,167
It's true. I have no idea.

712
01:14:37,750 --> 01:14:42,125
I know you guys are looking for this.

713
01:14:44,042 --> 01:14:45,542
You want it back?

714
01:14:48,832 --> 01:14:51,792
If you do,
I have a game for you.

715
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:02,500
I've seen Ong-Bak with my own eyes.

716
01:15:03,082 --> 01:15:06,667
Just say yes to join an underground fight
and you can have it back.

717
01:15:07,125 --> 01:15:08,582
Muay will be safe as well.

718
01:15:10,042 --> 01:15:13,582
What do you say? Yes or no?

719
01:15:17,082 --> 01:15:18,875
I'll do whatever you want.

720
01:15:20,875 --> 01:15:22,917
I just need to take Ong-Bak home
to our village.

721
01:15:25,332 --> 01:15:27,707
I would do anything.

722
01:15:46,875 --> 01:15:48,917
Why hold this fight
all the way at the border?

723
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:55,875
I needed a new place
for my underground fights.

724
01:15:56,457 --> 01:16:00,167
And out here, if anyone dies,
it won't be my problem.

725
01:16:00,500 --> 01:16:04,082
Oh, you've really got a grudge
against that redneck.

726
01:16:05,667 --> 01:16:08,750
If you're feeling lucky, name the stakes.

727
01:16:10,125 --> 01:16:11,667
Now you like the underdog?

728
01:17:04,457 --> 01:17:06,457
It's time for tonight's highlight.

729
01:17:06,707 --> 01:17:13,167
In the east corner is a Thai boxer
named Ting, Pradu's Pride.

730
01:17:13,292 --> 01:17:16,792
He's a rookie. He's a rising star.

731
01:17:16,957 --> 01:17:18,875
A Burmese boxer is in the west corner.

732
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:22,457
He's a skilled boxer from Myanmar.

733
01:17:22,625 --> 01:17:26,500
Showtime. The fight has begun.

734
01:17:26,625 --> 01:17:29,707
Saming Tiger is making his
return to the ring.

735
01:17:29,792 --> 01:17:32,625
He has been away from
underground boxing

736
01:17:32,792 --> 01:17:36,125
and now he's back, people.
Watch closely.

737
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:40,832
Ting gives him a front kick,
a sidekick and a left kick.

738
01:17:40,917 --> 01:17:46,417
Right kick, but misses.
They're both great and fearless.

739
01:17:46,875 --> 01:17:48,082
A right kick from Ting.

740
01:17:49,667 --> 01:17:52,416
Another right kick,
but it's nothing for Saming.

741
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:55,041
Another kick to the chest.

742
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:57,957
Front kick to the chest.

743
01:17:58,042 --> 01:18:01,000
One more front kick.
Saming is perfectly fine.

744
01:18:01,417 --> 01:18:04,625
He's unbreakable.
He's calling his opponent out.

745
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,250
They're watching each other.

746
01:18:06,917 --> 01:18:11,207
Ting gives him a kick,
again and again.

747
01:18:12,000 --> 01:18:16,167
Saming is so calm. Why?
He was kicked in the neck!

748
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:21,832
Wow! He's roaring.
He's going to make a move now.

749
01:18:22,417 --> 01:18:24,167
Ting steps backwards

750
01:18:24,332 --> 01:18:29,832
then punches him in the stomach, his face
and an elbow blow to his stomach again.

751
01:18:29,957 --> 01:18:31,500
Saming is boiling up.

752
01:18:31,625 --> 01:18:34,623
He gives him three punches in a row
and then a kick to the neck.

753
01:18:34,707 --> 01:18:38,375
He was thrown

754
01:18:38,542 --> 01:18:42,541
and now he's being pinned down with knees.

755
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:46,417
The judge is trying
to separate them and...

756
01:18:46,582 --> 01:18:50,292
What's that?
The judge was thrown, too,

757
01:18:50,417 --> 01:18:52,792
and the other judge is kicked in the neck.

758
01:18:54,042 --> 01:18:55,417
Wow! What's going on here?

759
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:01,625
Ting strikes with his elbow.
Saming lunges for his throat.

760
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:05,500
He's ruthless.
Saming hits out with his knee

761
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:08,000
again and again,
another strike with the elbow.

762
01:19:08,457 --> 01:19:12,166
One more back kick,
Ting bounces back into the punch.

763
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:18,082
He's spinning around
and down to the ground.

764
01:19:19,875 --> 01:19:21,375
Hey! Ting!

765
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:23,875
He gives up!

766
01:19:24,042 --> 01:19:26,875
Saming is the last man standing.

767
01:19:27,207 --> 01:19:31,000
Our judges are knocked out.
He turns to his opponent's coach.

768
01:19:31,207 --> 01:19:35,125
He's so furious.
What's wrong with him?

769
01:19:35,292 --> 01:19:36,792
Ting falls out the ring.

770
01:19:45,625 --> 01:19:47,500
Hey!

771
01:20:05,625 --> 01:20:08,832
Hey! If you want Ong-Bak, follow me.

772
01:20:22,917 --> 01:20:25,417
Go!

773
01:20:39,792 --> 01:20:44,000
This is your prize
for making the redneck lose the fight.

774
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:56,000
Hey! That's the Lord's statue!

775
01:20:56,707 --> 01:21:00,500
It's the piece of crap
you've been looking for.

776
01:21:02,125 --> 01:21:04,250
I don't worship lumps of stone
like your stupid people.

777
01:21:05,042 --> 01:21:06,917
I worship myself.

778
01:21:08,082 --> 01:21:10,125
You should worship me, too.

779
01:21:10,250 --> 01:21:13,500
I'm the one who decides
whether you live or die.

780
01:21:15,832 --> 01:21:16,750
Son of a bitch!

781
01:21:17,542 --> 01:21:18,542
You betrayed us.

782
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:21,417
You told me to make Ting lose the game.

783
01:21:21,957 --> 01:21:24,541
You're not giving him Ong-Bak.
Damn you!

784
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:27,292
You son of a bitch!

785
01:21:30,582 --> 01:21:32,042
Take it easy.

786
01:21:32,832 --> 01:21:34,917
I lost millions because of that head.

787
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:40,000
You can't have it back
until I get my money back.

788
01:21:40,792 --> 01:21:44,082
Remember this, I am the Lord.

789
01:21:45,042 --> 01:21:48,042
Finish them off
and meet me at the cave.

790
01:22:04,917 --> 01:22:06,667
Hey! Kill him.

791
01:22:19,457 --> 01:22:20,332
George!

792
01:22:22,167 --> 01:22:24,832
Damn it!
I said make it quick and quiet.

793
01:22:40,167 --> 01:22:43,000
Come on!
The cops will be here in a minute.

794
01:22:52,582 --> 01:22:54,167
You, go over there. Go!

795
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:51,167
Where's Ong-Bak?

796
01:25:08,125 --> 01:25:09,707
Hey! Take me with you.

797
01:25:09,832 --> 01:25:10,750
No.

798
01:25:11,832 --> 01:25:13,375
I won't let anyone die for Ong-Bak.

799
01:25:14,625 --> 01:25:17,125
But if anyone does, it'll be me,
no one else.

800
01:25:17,875 --> 01:25:18,957
Damn it.

801
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:23,875
Ting.

802
01:25:25,292 --> 01:25:26,250
Ting.

803
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:30,000
Let me help you.

804
01:25:33,417 --> 01:25:35,917
Everything I've done,
I didn't mean it.

805
01:25:37,042 --> 01:25:38,375
I apologize to you.

806
01:25:38,832 --> 01:25:40,832
Just let me do it
for people of Nong Pradu.

807
01:25:43,250 --> 01:25:46,500
At least let me start the engine for you.

808
01:25:49,792 --> 01:25:52,707
I, Humlae, from Nong Pradu.

809
01:26:06,250 --> 01:26:11,042
Don said that there's a hidden cave
around the other side of the mountain.

810
01:26:41,167 --> 01:26:42,082
Hey!

811
01:27:54,667 --> 01:27:55,625
Hey!

812
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:28,750
Hey!

813
01:30:00,625 --> 01:30:02,167
Why can't you just die?

814
01:30:09,875 --> 01:30:13,667
I just cut this off
and you risk your life for it.

815
01:30:14,792 --> 01:30:16,457
How about this giant statue's head?

816
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:32,707
Hey!

817
01:31:58,375 --> 01:31:59,917
Ting! Ting!

818
01:32:02,417 --> 01:32:03,457
Ting!

819
01:33:18,417 --> 01:33:20,375
Humlae! Are you okay?

820
01:33:27,750 --> 01:33:30,457
Go get Ong-Bak. Go!

821
01:33:33,792 --> 01:33:37,125
Don't worry about me.
Get Ong-Bak. Quick!

822
01:34:43,207 --> 01:34:45,750
Hey! Where are they going?

823
01:34:46,167 --> 01:34:47,707
Keep doing your job!

824
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:50,167
Cut the head off!

825
01:34:59,082 --> 01:35:02,582
Be careful.
I made him lose the fight last time.

826
01:36:15,167 --> 01:36:16,750
It's nearly off, boss.

827
01:36:17,082 --> 01:36:19,417
Good. Cut it off.

828
01:39:14,457 --> 01:39:15,875
Hey!

829
01:40:10,917 --> 01:40:12,332
You really want this?

830
01:40:13,375 --> 01:40:15,542
If was broken into pieces...

831
01:40:16,250 --> 01:40:17,875
would you still want it?

832
01:41:41,250 --> 01:41:42,207
Humlae!

833
01:41:44,375 --> 01:41:46,207
Humlae! Are you all right?

834
01:41:49,582 --> 01:41:50,625
Take...

835
01:41:51,625 --> 01:41:53,667
Ong-Bak...

836
01:41:54,417 --> 01:41:58,292
home. Our home.

837
01:41:59,042 --> 01:42:02,167
George!
Why are you such a mess?

838
01:42:04,582 --> 01:42:05,582
Get out.

839
01:42:05,832 --> 01:42:07,542
Muay...

840
01:42:09,167 --> 01:42:10,207
go...

841
01:42:11,250 --> 01:42:12,832
to school...

842
01:42:14,167 --> 01:42:15,292
and study.

843
01:42:16,917 --> 01:42:19,417
Find a job when you graduate.

844
01:42:26,125 --> 01:42:30,750
Ting, tell my father

845
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:32,707
I...

846
01:42:34,625 --> 01:42:37,542
can't be a monk for him.

847
01:42:38,332 --> 01:42:40,707
What are you talking about?

848
01:42:40,832 --> 01:42:43,250
Just go to a hospital
and you'll be fine, George.

849
01:42:43,500 --> 01:42:44,582
Humlae!

850
01:42:45,167 --> 01:42:48,500
George! My bro!

851
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,582
You can't just die!

852
01:42:52,000 --> 01:42:55,457
You promised me
you would take care of me!

853
01:42:55,582 --> 01:42:58,582
You can't die like this.
You can't die for me.

854
01:42:58,667 --> 01:43:01,957
You can't die before I do.
You can't, got it?

855
01:43:02,042 --> 01:43:03,625
You promised me.

856
01:43:03,875 --> 01:43:06,875
I have no one left! No one!

857
01:43:07,082 --> 01:43:10,041
You come back right now!
Don't do this to me.

858
01:43:10,125 --> 01:43:15,457
You can't leave me!
Wake up now!

859
01:43:15,917 --> 01:43:19,957
George! You can't die.
You promised me.

860
01:43:21,332 --> 01:43:22,917
No!

861
01:43:23,207 --> 01:43:25,957
No! You can't die.

862
01:43:26,042 --> 01:43:29,042
I'm not gonna cry for you.

863
01:43:29,500 --> 01:43:32,082
Wake up! Now!

864
01:43:32,167 --> 01:43:36,500
Talk to me. I will behave.

865
01:43:36,750 --> 01:43:38,957
I have nobody left.

866
01:43:39,082 --> 01:43:41,875
I said wake up!

867
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:45,417
No!

868
01:43:45,542 --> 01:43:50,167
Wake up! You promised me
Don't you dare lie to me.

869
01:48:14,042 --> 01:48:15,832
