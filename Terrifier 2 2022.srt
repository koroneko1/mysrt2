1
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,616
What's wrong with you?
Where did you even get that?

2
00:00:51,618 --> 00:00:53,353
Johnny, what are you doing?

3
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,010
9-1-1, what is your emergency?

4
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,715
Hello? 9-1-1.

5
00:01:57,817 --> 00:01:59,552
Do you have an emergency?

6
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:02,689
Sir, can you speak?

7
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,323
If you can't speak,

8
00:02:05,325 --> 00:02:06,924
press any button on your phone.

9
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:09,028
Once for yes, twice for no.

10
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:11,731
Are you still there?

11
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:15,733
Sir,
I want you to stay on the line

12
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,004
for me, okay?
I'm gonna track your location.

13
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,348
Are you still with me?

14
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,549
Hello?

15
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,886
Are you still there?

16
00:02:37,223 --> 00:02:39,123
Okay.
129, Peterson Drive,

17
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,958
Miles County Morgue.

18
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,363
Sir, are you still with me?

19
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,797
Just sit tight and remain calm.

20
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,568
Police and paramedics
are on their way...

21
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,714
♪ You're not alone ♪

22
00:10:03,869 --> 00:10:05,404
♪ You're not alone ♪

23
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,149
♪ You're not alone ♪

24
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:22,353
Ma'am, I understand.

25
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,055
But I can't give you
that information.

26
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,492
Your husband's the only one
listed on the policy.

27
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:29,727
Bitch!

28
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:32,896
No, ma'am, not you. Not you.

29
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,598
Mom, don't we have
a tape measure?

30
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,532
I don't know.

31
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,067
Check the drawer
by the microwave.

32
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:38,836
Yes, ma'am!

33
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,405
I understand that,
but in the future,

34
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:43,776
your husband's going
to have to call the policy.

35
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:48,547
All I can tell you
is that it's still active.

36
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:51,717
Yes.

37
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,453
Mm hmm.

38
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,289
Can you wait five minutes,
and go get your brother, please?

39
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,290
Yes, ma'am.

40
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,259
My manager
is just gonna tell you

41
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,362
the same thing.

42
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:07,231
So, did you figure out

43
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,534
what you're dressing up
as tomorrow?

44
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:11,702
The Miles County clown.

45
00:11:11,704 --> 00:11:14,371
- Don't do that.
- Why not?

46
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:16,306
Because that's beyond
disrespectful.

47
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:17,608
What are we talking about?

48
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,143
He wants to dress up
as a real guy

49
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:21,045
who murdered nine people
last year.

50
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:23,614
Do you have any idea
how insensitive that is?

51
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:25,149
Not to mention, sick.

52
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:27,785
- Oh, you're not doing that.
- It's just a costume.

53
00:11:27,787 --> 00:11:29,753
How would you feel
if God forbid,

54
00:11:29,755 --> 00:11:31,055
he attacked someone
in our family,

55
00:11:31,057 --> 00:11:32,990
and people celebrated him?

56
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:34,291
That's basically
what you're doing.

57
00:11:34,293 --> 00:11:36,326
You don't see people
dressing up as Jeffrey Dahmer

58
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,327
or Charles Manson.

59
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:38,896
I think
you're both overreacting.

60
00:11:38,898 --> 00:11:40,130
Do you?

61
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,266
Charles Manson technically
never killed anyone.

62
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,134
All right, all right. Enough.

63
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:46,172
I said, "No," and that's it.

64
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:51,408
Did you know that Nazis used
to inject children's eyeballs

65
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,010
to see
if they would change color?

66
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:54,278
Jonathan!

67
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,314
Thank you.

68
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,988
So, what are your plans
tomorrow?

69
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,824
Megan Melanie's throwing
a Halloween party.

70
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,592
That's nice.

71
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,627
Who are you going with, Allie?

72
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:11,430
And Brooke.

73
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,933
She's not driving, is she?

74
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:17,301
I'm gonna take an Uber.

75
00:12:17,303 --> 00:12:19,169
Why, so you can get shitfaced?

76
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,438
Who do you think I am,
stupid, Sienna?

77
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,007
Do we have to do this
every time I go out?

78
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:25,642
You know I don't drink.

79
00:12:25,644 --> 00:12:27,546
So you say.

80
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:37,287
Your brother never closes
these goddamn boxes.

81
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,724
Give me that. I got it.

82
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,799
Mom, do you ever...

83
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,869
wonder about Jonathan?

84
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,170
What do you mean?

85
00:12:53,172 --> 00:12:54,340
You know, he's...

86
00:13:08,754 --> 00:13:10,821
- He's an oddball.
- So, what?

87
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:14,057
He was looking up serial killers
when I went in his room before.

88
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:16,660
Now, he's... he's talking
about Nazis and the Holocaust.

89
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:19,530
- I mean...
- It's just a phase, Sienna.

90
00:13:19,532 --> 00:13:20,833
It'll pass.

91
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,903
You said that a year ago.

92
00:13:33,379 --> 00:13:36,282
Yeah, well, he lost his father.

93
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,584
And I didn't?

94
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:42,419
You don't see me
crying out for attention.

95
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:44,922
Yeah, well, I wish you would
from time to time.

96
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:47,791
You keep everything bottled up.
It's not healthy.

97
00:13:47,793 --> 00:13:49,426
All right.

98
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,929
Just don't be surprised if you
find a dead animal in his room.

99
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,732
You know what?
Watch your mouth, huh?

100
00:14:14,653 --> 00:14:16,620
And what about you?

101
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:21,625
When Daddy took you fishing
for those midos or macos.

102
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:22,759
Minnows.

103
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:24,461
Whatever they're called.

104
00:14:24,463 --> 00:14:27,798
And he found you
cutting the heads off.

105
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,967
Didn't think I'd remember that,
did you?

106
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:31,768
I was a lot younger
than Jonathan.

107
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,837
Well, you were old enough
to know the difference

108
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,472
between right and wrong.

109
00:14:35,474 --> 00:14:36,475
Your brother's fine.

110
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,134
Do you have any Super Glue?

111
00:15:09,441 --> 00:15:10,209
A little.

112
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,146
- Why, what happened?
- The string came off.

113
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:17,214
I thought you weren't gonna wear
this tomorrow.

114
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,383
I won't paint my face then.

115
00:15:19,385 --> 00:15:21,353
- Jonathan.
- Come on.

116
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:23,956
It's too late
to get another costume.

117
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,126
Give me.

118
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,463
Jesus. What, did you grow
another foot since dinner?

119
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,632
Tallest kid in my class.

120
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:37,901
Yeah, well, I can still kick
your ass.

121
00:15:37,903 --> 00:15:38,871
Not for long.

122
00:15:41,707 --> 00:15:43,740
That is sick.

123
00:15:43,742 --> 00:15:46,512
- How much do you have left?
- Just finishing up the skull.

124
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,380
It looks
just like Daddy's character.

125
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:51,548
You know?

126
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:53,884
You draw almost as good
as him now.

127
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:54,920
Thanks.

128
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,727
Is this a part
of your costume, too?

129
00:16:03,729 --> 00:16:06,530
No. I could not walk out
in the streets with that thing.

130
00:16:06,532 --> 00:16:07,998
I'd get arrested
in like two seconds.

131
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,833
Yeah. But nobody
would mess with you.

132
00:16:09,835 --> 00:16:11,168
- That's for sure.
- Right.

133
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:13,706
Just be careful, please.
That blade's like razor sharp.

134
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,578
There. Should be good now.

135
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,414
Awesome.

136
00:16:26,585 --> 00:16:28,251
You think
that guy's still out there?

137
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,187
Who?

138
00:16:30,189 --> 00:16:31,423
The Miles County clown.

139
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:34,624
What's up with you
and this clown all of a sudden?

140
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,293
You're like obsessed.

141
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,095
They never found his body.

142
00:16:38,097 --> 00:16:39,730
What if he decides
to come back here?

143
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:41,698
Is that why you wanna dress up
like him?

144
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,200
You think if he sees you
wearing his costume,

145
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,469
he'll be all cordial with you?

146
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:46,305
Cordial?

147
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:48,307
Friendly.

148
00:16:49,608 --> 00:16:51,274
No.

149
00:16:51,276 --> 00:16:52,943
I wouldn't worry about it.

150
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,212
On the off chance
that he is still alive,

151
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,448
I'm sure he's gone far away
from here.

152
00:16:59,952 --> 00:17:02,454
- Thanks again for the hat.
- You're welcome.

153
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:12,498
Tap lower down.

154
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:32,418
Owen, I saw it again.

155
00:17:38,257 --> 00:17:39,191

Will you help this man?

182
00:19:35,574 --> 00:19:40,911
You, over there!
Yeah! Feed this man.

183
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:46,316
How about you? He's hungry.
Will you feed this man?

184
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:49,922
He's not invisible. Feed him!

185
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,291
New Art
Crispies from Sugar Plum.

186
00:19:54,293 --> 00:19:57,129
Fun, little surprises
in every bite.

187
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:02,465
Glass, insects, and razor blade.

188
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:05,302
There's no telling
what you may find!

189
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,905
Special prize included
in every box.

190
00:20:08,907 --> 00:20:11,942
Wow! I wonder what I got!

191
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,944
Speaking of surprises, kids,

192
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:16,846
we have a very special guest
with us today.

193
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,848
Now, for a guy
who doesn't speak,

194
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,751
he sure makes a lot of noise.

195
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:27,025
All the way from Miles County,
please welcome Art the Clown.

196
00:21:47,072 --> 00:21:50,442
Whoo! Whoo! Yeah!

197
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,847
Yeah!

198
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:09,619
Stop everything
you're doing now!

199
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:15,625
I see you feeding your faces.
Feed him! He's so hungry.

200
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:19,696
Feed this man!
Feed this man!

201
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:22,768
Feed this man!

202
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:13,411
Special
prize included in every box.

203
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,169
Shit.

204
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,407
What's going on?

205
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,711
- Mom!
- Get downstairs!

206
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:56,181
Jesus Christ!

207
00:26:57,816 --> 00:26:59,718
Mom,
what are you doing? Come on!

208
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:13,563
Really, Sienna?

209
00:27:13,565 --> 00:27:17,200
You left burning candles
on your dresser all night?

210
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,735
What are you, fucking stupid?

211
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,104
I didn't do anything.
They weren't lit.

212
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:22,238
Then please explain to me

213
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,507
how your goddamn room
caught on fire.

214
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,909
- I have no idea.
- You have no idea.

215
00:27:26,911 --> 00:27:30,613
So, it just spontaneously
combusted out of thin air?

216
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,751
- I guess so.
- Sienna...

217
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,686
Get back to bed.
You have school in the morning.

218
00:27:36,688 --> 00:27:39,424
- You mean I still have to go?
- What did I say?

219
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,693
You know what, Sienna?

220
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,695
You are going to kill us
one of these days,

221
00:27:45,697 --> 00:27:47,630
between your chemicals
and your heat guns,

222
00:27:47,632 --> 00:27:49,098
and staying up until 4:00

223
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,901
in the fucking morning
doing God only knows what!

224
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:53,302
Oh, my God.
For the hundredth time,

225
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:54,771
I was not using chemicals

226
00:27:54,773 --> 00:27:57,375
and I did not leave
burning candles on my dresser!

227
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,779
- Why can't you just believe me?
- Because...

228
00:28:03,782 --> 00:28:07,450
Stay in my room tonight,
and I'll sleep on the couch.

229
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,419
I don't mind sleeping
on the couch.

230
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,155
Go to bed.

231
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,212
I kept whatever
was in the bottom drawer.

232
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:44,516
Most of it's ruined.

233
00:29:46,551 --> 00:29:49,852
Make sure you park
in the garage when you get home.

234
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:52,421
Those animals next door
are always throwing eggs

235
00:29:52,423 --> 00:29:54,190
and shaving cream.

236
00:29:54,192 --> 00:29:56,361
I don't want the car
getting scratched up.

237
00:29:59,531 --> 00:30:01,564
You know the sword Daddy got me?

238
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:02,400
What about it?

239
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:06,571
It was on top of my dresser
last night.

240
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,742
Well, maybe it can be restored.

241
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:13,278
Is it bad?

242
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:16,913
It's fine.

243
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,915
There's not a mark on it.

244
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,683
That's good.

245
00:30:20,685 --> 00:30:22,852
Can't say the same
for your clothes.

246
00:30:22,854 --> 00:30:24,856
Jonathan, hurry up.
You have five minutes.

247
00:31:23,014 --> 00:31:24,847
Welcome back to the program.

248
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:27,083
If you're just tuning in,
I'm sitting here live

249
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:29,485
with the sole survivor
of the Miles County massacre,

250
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:32,321
which occurred
exactly one year ago today.

251
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,257
I've worked on the show
for many years,

252
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,958
and I've never sat across
from someone

253
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,494
who has a story to tell
quite like yours.

254
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,863
Thank you again
for taking the time to sit down

255
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:43,099
- and speak with me.
- It's my pleasure.

256
00:31:43,101 --> 00:31:45,835
Now, when we left off,
we were talking about the moment

257
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:47,470
you woke up from the coma.

258
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:48,938
Do you remember
your initial reaction

259
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,306
when you first saw your face?

260
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,841
Yes.

261
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:55,344
Would you like
to share that with us?

262
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:58,014
I wished I was dead.

263
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,249
Do you still feel that way?

264
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,384
People are frightened

265
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,820
by the way that I look,
especially children.

266
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:08,224
And it's really difficult for me
to deal with that,

267
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,627
so isolation is ideal.

268
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:13,629
Now, what about your attacker?

269
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:15,400
The man only identified
as Art the Clown.

270
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:18,000
Well, there's a lot
of controversy

271
00:32:18,002 --> 00:32:20,036
surrounding his supposed death.

272
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,337
The authorities issued
a statement,

273
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,872
claiming that his body
disappeared

274
00:32:22,874 --> 00:32:25,374
from the county coroner's office
the morning after the attack.

275
00:32:25,376 --> 00:32:27,845
He's dead.
I saw it happen.

276
00:32:43,928 --> 00:32:46,262
- What are you guys doing?
- Dude, look what Sean found.

277
00:32:46,264 --> 00:32:47,432
It's the new mascot.

278
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,367
Oh, man.

279
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,670
Right up your alley, huh, J man?

280
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,105
I wonder how it died.

281
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:57,375
Probably
had the school meatloaf.

282
00:32:58,576 --> 00:33:00,343
I think
you should leave it alone.

283
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:03,279
What for? He doesn't mind.

284
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,613
It's so gross.

285
00:33:04,615 --> 00:33:05,881
Dude, you should have been here.

286
00:33:05,883 --> 00:33:07,183
Couple of birds
were eating his asshole.

287
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,052
Yeah.

288
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,056
Watch this. Stephanie!

289
00:33:13,891 --> 00:33:16,292
Stephanie!
Come here for a minute.

290
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:18,229
Sean, come on.

291
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:21,397
It's gonna be awesome.

292
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:23,199
- What's up?
- Check it out.

293
00:33:23,201 --> 00:33:25,368
Some cat just gave birth
behind the dumpster.

294
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,535
- Really?
- Yeah.

295
00:33:26,537 --> 00:33:28,373
Go look at all the kittens.

296
00:33:36,748 --> 00:33:37,648
Oh, my God!

297
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:41,753
What's wrong?
Maggots need love, too!

298
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:45,254
Stephanie!

299
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:47,291
Can you?

300
00:33:48,393 --> 00:33:49,625
What's going on?

301
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:50,628
Oh, shit. Ms. Principe.

302
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:54,332
What are you boys doing
back here?

303
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,000
Oh, Christ. Mr. Henderson.

304
00:33:58,002 --> 00:33:59,502
- Nothing.
- Really?

305
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:01,070
You go find
Mr. Curtis right now,

306
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,772
and you have him move that.

307
00:34:02,774 --> 00:34:04,974
And you two, get to class.

308
00:34:04,976 --> 00:34:06,477
Move it!

309
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:38,609
Jonathan.

310
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:42,213
Keep your eyes
on your own paper.

311
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,551
Mr. Whalen.

312
00:34:48,986 --> 00:34:50,486
May I be excused?

313
00:34:50,488 --> 00:34:52,221
Wait. I think
I forgot my shorts.

314
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:53,989
I think I have an extra pair.

315
00:34:53,991 --> 00:34:55,991
- Do you have an extra shirt?
- I might.

316
00:34:55,993 --> 00:34:57,862
We can go to the bathroom...

317
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:16,972
Hey! No running in the hallways!

318
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:18,075
Jonathan, get back here!

319
00:36:27,451 --> 00:36:29,287
Oh, my God.

320
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,262
Happy Halloween, my pretty.

321
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:42,598
- Little early for chocolate, no?
- Mm.

322
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,300
You're talking to someone
who eats Count Chocula

323
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,335
on a regular basis.

324
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:48,404
Can we not talk about cereal?

325
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:49,505
Please?

326
00:36:49,507 --> 00:36:50,608
Okay.

327
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:55,911
Someone's in a mood
this morning.

328
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:57,413
Sorry.

329
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,183
Barely slept last night.

330
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:01,450
Let me guess.

331
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,819
You were up until 4:00
in the morning,

332
00:37:03,821 --> 00:37:06,257
working
on that Halloween costume again.

333
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:11,460
Actually, it was more like 6:00.

334
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:13,596
Did you guys hear
about Monica Brown this morning?

335
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:15,531
Ugh! That bitchy talk show host?

336
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,701
Yeah, that bitchy talk show host
totally got her face torn off.

337
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:20,436
What?

338
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:21,604
Okay, get this.

339
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:23,205
So, she had that Miles County
survivor on.

340
00:37:23,207 --> 00:37:24,840
Do you remember the one
who was in the coma

341
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:26,508
and her face was all mutilated?
What's her name?

342
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,644
It was like, I don't know,
Victoria or something.

343
00:37:28,646 --> 00:37:30,679
- Victoria Heyes?
- Yes.

344
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,348
She had a meltdown
on the show, right?

345
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,950
And then backstage,
she went full-on psycho,

346
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,686
and mauled Monica Brown
with her bare hands.

347
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:39,624
- No way.
- Oh, my God.

348
00:37:41,058 --> 00:37:43,225
Is she dead?

349
00:37:43,227 --> 00:37:45,327
I mean, if she's lucky.

350
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,163
What? You ever see photos
of those transplant faces,

351
00:37:48,165 --> 00:37:49,698
looking like Mr. Potato Head?

352
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:52,301
- Fuck that shit.
- God, is it really that bad?

353
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:53,235
Well, I haven't seen photos.

354
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:54,903
But from what I hear,

355
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,239
she kinda looks like
the inside of my cookie.

356
00:37:57,241 --> 00:37:59,241
Her eyes are all gouged out.

357
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:01,410
And her nose was like
falling off of her face.

358
00:38:01,412 --> 00:38:02,711
Oh, my God.

359
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,080
And I heard that her cheek

360
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,915
like a little bit, was found
at the bottom

361
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:08,517
of Victoria Heyes' shoe.

362
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:10,719
You okay?

363
00:38:10,721 --> 00:38:12,223
Sienna?

364
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:20,996
Hey, you all right?

365
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:22,031
I really didn't mean
to freak you out

366
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:22,998
with that Monica Brown shit.

367
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,400
- I'm so sorry.
- No.

368
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:26,435
- You okay?
- I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm fine.

369
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:30,074
I just...
I just need a second I think.

370
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:34,209
Hi. Excuse me.

371
00:38:34,211 --> 00:38:36,211
Can you mind your own business,
please?

372
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,180
Thank you.

373
00:38:38,182 --> 00:38:40,749
My God.
Sienna, talk to me.

374
00:38:40,751 --> 00:38:41,519
What's going on?

375
00:38:44,088 --> 00:38:46,221
We had... we had a fire
last night.

376
00:38:46,223 --> 00:38:48,891
- What? Where?
- My room.

377
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:52,961
I must've fallen asleep
with the candles burning.

378
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:55,431
- It was pretty bad.
- Okay. How bad is "pretty bad"?

379
00:38:55,433 --> 00:38:57,599
Like flames touching
the ceiling,

380
00:38:57,601 --> 00:38:59,568
entire house
could have burned down bad.

381
00:38:59,570 --> 00:39:02,905
- Jesus. Is everyone okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

382
00:39:02,907 --> 00:39:04,773
No, my mom
put the flames out in time.

383
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:06,709
Wow. Fucking Barbara
to the rescue.

384
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:08,777
I swear
that woman's a superhero.

385
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,580
- Was she pissed?
- Livid.

386
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,483
Berated me for a good hour
and a half this morning.

387
00:39:14,485 --> 00:39:15,584
I mean, that's not so bad.

388
00:39:15,586 --> 00:39:16,652
I mean, you did almost torch
the whole family

389
00:39:16,654 --> 00:39:18,320
in their sleep.

390
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:21,423
Look. The important thing
is that nobody got hurt. Right?

391
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:23,125
Seriously, in a few weeks,
you'll be laughing

392
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:25,227
- about the whole thing.
- More like months.

393
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,732
- Okay. A couple months.
- Probably a year.

394
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:31,469
It wasn't just the fire.

395
00:39:34,238 --> 00:39:35,172
It...

396
00:39:39,143 --> 00:39:42,478
Something really strange
happened last night.

397
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,414
What?

398
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,653
Nothing. Nothing. I'm fine.

399
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:55,023
- You sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

400
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:57,359
Yeah, no, come on. Um...

401
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:58,529
Let's... let's go back.

402
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,267
Now, that my food
is probably ice cold.

403
00:40:05,269 --> 00:40:06,735
You want a piece
of my Monica Brown cookie?

404
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,871
- Brooke.
- Sorry.

405
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:10,141
I hate you.

406
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,141
Thank you, Officer.

407
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,276
I'm so sorry
to cause you trouble.

408
00:40:14,278 --> 00:40:15,944
No problem.
Have a nice day, ma'am.

409
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:16,781
You, too.

410
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:26,655
- Get to your room.
- But mom, I...

411
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:28,657
Go to your room.

412
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,826
I don't wanna hear
another word out of you

413
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:32,363
until I say so.

414
00:40:44,742 --> 00:40:45,874
I can't believe I'm reduced

415
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:49,077
to a pair
of cheap store-bought wings.

416
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:50,546
You think these are too small?

417
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:51,780
How big do you want 'em?

418
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,482
You're gonna be knocking
over people's drinks

419
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:54,883
and shit all night.

420
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:57,352
I think they're cute.

421
00:40:57,354 --> 00:40:59,188
Well, they're not terrible.

422
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:00,989
You don't really have a choice.

423
00:41:00,991 --> 00:41:04,059
Ugh, it's my mom.

424
00:41:04,061 --> 00:41:07,095
Where did you tell your mother
we were going tonight?

425
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,999
Megan Melanie's Halloween party.

426
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,934
Okay. I'll catch you out front.

427
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,001
Okay.

428
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,271
Hey, Mom.

429
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,075
Good.

430
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:23,011
No, I'm just in town
with Sienna.

431
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:24,613
What time are you gonna be home?
Because...

432
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:25,883
Sorry.

433
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,919
I'm sorry.

434
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:33,188
Nice.

435
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:35,691
Nothing. I just ran into a man

436
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,728
wearing terrifying
clown costume.

437
00:42:44,361 --> 00:42:46,130
Can I help you find anything?

438
00:42:50,801 --> 00:42:51,869
Need any help?

439
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,352
Uh, find everything okay?

440
00:43:10,321 --> 00:43:11,522
Yeah. Mm hmm.

441
00:43:13,457 --> 00:43:15,025
I'm gonna need to scan those.

442
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,196
Oh. Um, right. Sorry.

443
00:43:21,198 --> 00:43:23,200
It's all good.

444
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,507
Okay. That'll be 32.25.

445
00:43:32,042 --> 00:43:33,010
Yeah, um...

446
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:37,982
I think
I left my bag downstairs.

447
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,115
Sir.

448
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:48,483
If you're gonna put that
in your mouth,

449
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:49,620
you gotta pay for it.

450
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,630
Here you go.

451
00:45:01,632 --> 00:45:02,666
Thanks.

452
00:45:08,338 --> 00:45:10,639
You know what?
I'm gonna go get you a big bag.

453
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:12,174
Oh, no, no. I... I really...

454
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:13,275
- I don't... I don't need it.
- No, no, it's fine.

455
00:45:13,277 --> 00:45:15,112
I got 'em right back here.

456
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:18,615
Okay.

457
00:45:44,308 --> 00:45:45,375
Please don't.

458
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,517
Stop. Please stop! Please!

459
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,520
Hey, buddy?

460
00:45:57,955 --> 00:45:59,289
You wanna quit causin' trouble?

461
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,295
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

462
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,799
- Happy Halloween.
- You, too.

463
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:41,763
Yo, we closin' up, man.

464
00:46:41,765 --> 00:46:43,433
Can I help you find something?

465
00:46:58,081 --> 00:46:59,249
8.99.

466
00:47:13,897 --> 00:47:15,065
Are you serious right now?

467
00:47:16,967 --> 00:47:19,603
Yo, can you pay for that or not?

468
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,376
Sir, what are you doing?

469
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,285
All right. Sir, you know what?
I'm gonna call the police.

470
00:47:46,997 --> 00:47:49,266
Hey! Did you hear what I said?

471
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:55,239
Get the hell outta here
before I fuck you up.

472
00:47:59,309 --> 00:48:00,976
That's fucking crazy.

473
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:02,911
I'm telling you
it was him, Allie.

474
00:48:02,913 --> 00:48:04,145
Right down
to the little black dot

475
00:48:04,147 --> 00:48:05,983
on the tip of his nose.

476
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,088
Sienna, you said it yourself.

477
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,189
I mean,
there are gonna be hundreds

478
00:48:14,191 --> 00:48:16,024
of douche bags dressed up
as that psycho tonight.

479
00:48:16,026 --> 00:48:18,126
Even your brother
was talking about going as him.

480
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,430
Not that I'm calling
your brother a douche bag.

481
00:48:27,037 --> 00:48:28,536
It's just a coincidence.

482
00:48:28,538 --> 00:48:30,272
Then how do you explain
the fire?

483
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:32,442
I dreamt it and it happened.

484
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:42,050
Did you change medications
recently?

485
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:43,887
Jesus Christ. I'm not crazy!

486
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,324
Take a breath.

487
00:48:55,065 --> 00:48:57,399
I... I'm just saying,
did you ever consider

488
00:48:57,401 --> 00:48:59,834
the logical explanation
that maybe the fire

489
00:48:59,836 --> 00:49:02,504
caused your nightmare,
not the other way around?

490
00:49:02,506 --> 00:49:03,240
What?

491
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:23,158
I think that the fire
started while you were sleeping.

492
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:24,926
And it worked its way
into your nightmare.

493
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,062
I mean, your body must've felt
the flames.

494
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,833
You know shit like that
happens all the time.

495
00:49:31,201 --> 00:49:33,401
Look, are you getting candy
or what?

496
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,006
I mean, what are...
What are we doing here?

497
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:39,741
Even if that is the case,

498
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,545
it doesn't explain
how the fire started.

499
00:49:48,518 --> 00:49:49,453
Come on, honey.

500
00:49:50,587 --> 00:49:52,921
Oh, my. They're closed.

501
00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,889
- Wow.
- Oh.

502
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:56,057
Look at that, Mom.

503
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:58,793
Yeah, that's wonderful, honey.

504
00:49:58,795 --> 00:49:59,629
Cool.

505
00:50:01,398 --> 00:50:03,898
All right. Let's go. Let's go.

506
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,266
You're just gonna stay here
the whole time.

507
00:50:05,268 --> 00:50:06,103
Come on.

508
00:50:12,542 --> 00:50:16,544
We don't go direct
with our insurers.

509
00:50:16,546 --> 00:50:18,580
Okay, but let me get
your zip code.

510
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,650
I'm gonna find a broker
in your area.

511
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,601
What are you doing home?

512
00:50:39,002 --> 00:50:40,103
He's here, Sienna.

513
00:50:42,072 --> 00:50:43,471
Who?

514
00:50:43,473 --> 00:50:45,106
The Miles County clown.

515
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:46,741
What are you talking about?

516
00:50:46,743 --> 00:50:48,676
I saw him today in my school.

517
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:50,478
Just like in the police photos.

518
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:52,180
Slow down.

519
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:54,082
It was him.

520
00:50:54,084 --> 00:50:55,685
Something really bad
is gonna happen tonight.

521
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,789
Is that Daddy's sketchbook?

522
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,590
Look here.

523
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,428
How long have you had this?

524
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:07,262
Jonathan, answer me.

525
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:09,798
You know how long
we've been looking for this.

526
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,599
Read this.

527
00:51:11,601 --> 00:51:14,335
I saw her today.
This exact girl.

528
00:51:14,337 --> 00:51:16,438
Only she didn't look human.

529
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,840
There's some kinda connection
between her, the old carnival,

530
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,642
and the Miles County clown.

531
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,177
Something really
bad's gonna happen tonight.

532
00:51:22,179 --> 00:51:24,212
I know it.

533
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:26,681
Did you put these in here?

534
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:27,651
No.

535
00:51:29,186 --> 00:51:31,521
But look at this.

536
00:51:33,056 --> 00:51:34,057
It's him!

537
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:37,060
Daddy drew this?

538
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:40,664
That's not all.

539
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:02,383
What if you're connected, too?

540
00:52:02,385 --> 00:52:04,319
What?

541
00:52:04,321 --> 00:52:07,489
Jonathan, you're acting crazy.

542
00:52:07,491 --> 00:52:09,424
You're acting crazy. Okay?

543
00:52:09,426 --> 00:52:11,759
He created
this character for you.

544
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:13,661
He gave you that sword
right before he died.

545
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:15,697
It's like he saw this coming.

546
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:17,499
Daddy drew a lot of things
for me.

547
00:52:17,501 --> 00:52:19,200
He bought me tons of shit.

548
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,202
Seriously,
what's wrong with you?

549
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:23,438
- Do you even hear yourself?
- What's going on in here?

550
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:24,706
Did he show you this?

551
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:25,940
She doesn't care.

552
00:52:25,942 --> 00:52:27,609
She's just pissed,
'cause I might get suspended.

553
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:29,010
Suspended. For what?

554
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,012
Oh, you didn't tell her?

555
00:52:31,014 --> 00:52:33,047
Your brother brought
a dead animal to school

556
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:34,249
this morning.

557
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:36,050
- What?
- Yeah.

558
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,522
A dead animal.
Can you believe it?

559
00:52:39,623 --> 00:52:41,022
He vandalized the halls.

560
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,423
I almost
had a fucking heart attack

561
00:52:42,425 --> 00:52:43,358
when they told me.

562
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:45,393
It wasn't me.
It was the clown.

563
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:46,961
The little girl brought it in.

564
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:50,465
I don't wanna hear another word
about this goddamn clown.

565
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:53,101
He was covered in blood
on his shirt and his hands

566
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,402
when he got here.

567
00:52:54,404 --> 00:52:56,538
The principal literally
caught you red-handed.

568
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:57,908
That's 'cause he threw it at me.

569
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:00,241
I should've listened to you.

570
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:02,076
You have been telling me
over and over again

571
00:53:02,078 --> 00:53:03,611
about this kid.

572
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:05,747
I'm calling Dr. Schiffrin
on Monday.

573
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:07,782
I'm putting a stop to this now.

574
00:53:07,784 --> 00:53:10,418
And put your goddamn bowl
in the sink.

575
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,588
I'm not telling you again.

576
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:14,656
It was him.

577
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:15,992
You gotta believe me.

578
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:20,931
Jonathan.

579
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,799
It was...

580
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:27,735
It was probably just some kids
at school, messing around.

581
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,671
It's the one-year anniversary.

582
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:32,807
I mean, I already saw some...

583
00:53:32,809 --> 00:53:35,812
jerk wearing that same costume
in Abracadabra an hour ago.

584
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,250
What about these drawings
and these articles then?

585
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:45,253
We both know what happened
to Daddy.

586
00:53:45,255 --> 00:53:48,556
Okay, none of this
was his fault.

587
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:51,759
And all of these ugly things
in here,

588
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,196
that's not who he was.

589
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,864
He loved you...

590
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:57,667
very much.

591
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,274
It's gonna be okay.

592
00:54:08,812 --> 00:54:11,446
- Stay home tonight.
- Jonathan.

593
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:13,815
Please. I'm begging you.

594
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:16,551
- Nothing's gonna happen.
- Fine.

595
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:17,852
Just don't act surprised
when a bunch of people

596
00:54:17,854 --> 00:54:18,989
get killed tonight.

597
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,039
Have you ever...

598
00:54:44,047 --> 00:54:45,048
I believe him.

599
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:48,051
About what?

600
00:54:49,886 --> 00:54:52,020
I don't think he vandalized
the school.

601
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,656
Oh, now, you believe him?

602
00:54:54,658 --> 00:54:56,257
Yesterday,
he was the Zodiac Killer.

603
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,360
What's changed?

604
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:03,266
Get the door.

605
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,336
Restaurants on the East Coast

606
00:55:08,338 --> 00:55:09,871
have recalled romaine lettuce

607
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:12,206
due to a recent
E. Coli outbreak.

608
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,575
At least 12 people
have been hospitalized

609
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:16,680
and two
are in critical condition.

610
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,781
- Hi.
- Trick or treat!

611
00:55:19,783 --> 00:55:22,784
Happy Halloween.

612
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:24,252
Oh, I love your makeup.

613
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,788
Oh, she did it all herself.

614
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:29,223
Wow! Great job.

615
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:30,291
What do you say?

616
00:55:30,293 --> 00:55:31,726
Thank you.

617
00:55:31,728 --> 00:55:33,027
You're welcome.

618
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,631
- Bye.
- Bye.

619
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:07,964
Ah, aren't you a little old
to be trick or treating?

620
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,266
Wait a minute.

621
00:56:12,268 --> 00:56:14,137
Aren't you that guy
from the costume shop?

622
00:56:15,171 --> 00:56:16,604
You are?

623
00:56:16,606 --> 00:56:19,476
What are you doing here? Oh.

624
00:56:20,810 --> 00:56:22,846
Seriously, do you live
around here or something?

625
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,849
Hmm.

626
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:30,485
You're really weird,
you know that?

627
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:33,154
Yeah. Look, I get it, dude.

628
00:56:33,156 --> 00:56:36,090
The whole creepy, silent
mime gimmick.

629
00:56:36,092 --> 00:56:37,792
I mean, it's very effective.

630
00:56:37,794 --> 00:56:40,828
And the blood
is a nice touch also.

631
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:44,165
Yeah.
I can't give you anything.

632
00:56:44,167 --> 00:56:48,202
No, I'm sorry. Really.
No... no candy for grownups.

633
00:56:48,204 --> 00:56:49,038
Come on.

634
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:59,914
Go away.

635
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:02,519
Seriously, asshole,
go bother somebody else.

636
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:07,789
Are you kidding me right now?

637
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,393
I said, get out of here.
I mean it.

638
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:15,732
Wait. So, if I give you candy,
you'll leave?

639
00:57:19,169 --> 00:57:21,402
Fine.

640
00:57:21,404 --> 00:57:24,541
Here. Happy Halloween.

641
00:58:06,950 --> 00:58:08,049
In other news,

642
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:10,451
talk show provocateur,
Monica Brown

643
00:58:10,453 --> 00:58:13,054
is still in critical condition
this evening,

644
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:15,022
following a violent attack
which took place

645
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:17,425
at KLA Studios earlier today.

646
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,627
The TV host
was violently assaulted

647
00:58:19,629 --> 00:58:22,029
in her dressing room
after a live broadcast

648
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:23,965
with guest Victoria Heyes.

649
00:58:23,967 --> 00:58:27,401
Heyes is the sole survivor
of the Miles County massacre

650
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:30,571
of 2017, which left
eight people dead

651
00:58:30,573 --> 00:58:32,940
and Heyes in critical condition.

652
00:58:32,942 --> 00:58:35,042
The 20-year-old was arrested
at the crime scene,

653
00:58:35,044 --> 00:58:37,712
and taken into custody
by authorities.

654
00:58:37,714 --> 00:58:39,413
The interview sparked
controversy

655
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:41,449
upon its announcement
given Brown's

656
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:43,484
exploitative tendencies.

657
00:58:43,486 --> 00:58:45,920
Heyes was released
from St. Michael's Hospital

658
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:48,823
yesterday evening
after months of rehabilitation

659
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:50,958
and psychoanalysis.

660
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,762
Like you, Sienna.

661
00:58:56,165 --> 00:58:58,266
Halloween is officially here,

662
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,234
and thousands are lining up
for the parade

663
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,570
in New York City's East Village.

664
00:59:02,572 --> 00:59:05,139
Weather conditions are expected
to be cold and rainy,

665
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:07,343
so dress warm
if you're planning to attend.

666
01:03:37,013 --> 01:03:39,348
No! No!

667
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:43,286
No!

668
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:47,423
No!

669
01:03:52,094 --> 01:03:53,196
No!

670
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:11,080
No, no!

671
01:06:19,208 --> 01:06:20,674
Johnny!

672
01:06:20,676 --> 01:06:22,443
You're still afraid.

673
01:06:22,445 --> 01:06:24,280
Stop it now. I mean it.

674
01:06:28,351 --> 01:06:31,118
They're coming
to get you, Barbara.

675
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,553
Well?

676
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:34,455
Stop it! You're ignorant.

677
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:35,789
They're coming for you, Barbara.

678
01:06:35,791 --> 01:06:37,124
It's revealing.

679
01:06:37,126 --> 01:06:38,058
Stop it.

680
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:39,226
Three months' worth of work,

681
01:06:39,228 --> 01:06:41,395
and all you can say
is it's revealing?

682
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,931
Your tits are practically
popping out.

683
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:44,798
They are not!

684
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:46,567
They are! Turn around.

685
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:47,603
Here he comes now.

686
01:06:48,804 --> 01:06:49,770
Johnny!

687
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:52,106
You know what I was making?

688
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:53,707
It's Daddy's character.

689
01:06:53,709 --> 01:06:56,276
Yes, but seeing it on paper

690
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:59,580
and seeing it on your daughter
are two different things.

691
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:01,315
You look like you're going
to a strip club.

692
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:04,618
Mom, this is how people dress
on Halloween these days.

693
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:05,953
Do you have any idea
how much work

694
01:07:05,955 --> 01:07:06,887
I put into this?

695
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:08,489
You did an excellent job.

696
01:07:08,491 --> 01:07:13,460
But when did Halloween
become synonymous with sex?

697
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:14,630
You're such a prude.

698
01:07:16,232 --> 01:07:18,067
Okay. That's my ride. Later.

699
01:07:20,503 --> 01:07:21,337
Sienna.

700
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:26,976
Dad would have loved it.

701
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:29,745
Bye.

702
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:39,088
Allie!

703
01:07:40,689 --> 01:07:42,923
Have you been handing out candy?

704
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:45,694
That bowl is still filled
to the brim.

705
01:07:48,864 --> 01:07:49,999
Allie!

706
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:01,844
Oh, my God.

707
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:10,486
Allie?

708
01:08:13,055 --> 01:08:16,025
Allie? Allie, answer me.

709
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:18,559
Where are you?

710
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:20,029
Allie?

711
01:08:30,206 --> 01:08:34,310
Oh, no! No, no! No! No!

712
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:49,725
Mom.

713
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:12,779
What'd I tell you?

714
01:09:12,781 --> 01:09:14,548
I never doubted you
for a second.

715
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:16,385
Come on. Let's go get fucked up.

716
01:09:17,887 --> 01:09:19,019
What can I get you guys?

717
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:21,188
Uh, vodka and coke, please.

718
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:22,556
What do you want?

719
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,590
Off your phone.
What do you want?

720
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:25,025
Uh, rum and coke. Mixed.

721
01:09:25,027 --> 01:09:27,796
Also, can we have two shots
of whiskey, please? Thank you.

722
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,932
Has Allie texted you back yet?

723
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,767
No.

724
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:34,904
Well, can you check?

725
01:09:37,873 --> 01:09:39,973
Negative.

726
01:09:39,975 --> 01:09:41,475
You know this isn't like her.

727
01:09:41,477 --> 01:09:42,509
It's fine.

728
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,912
Just relax.

729
01:09:44,914 --> 01:09:47,616
And have a good time
for once in your life, okay?

730
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:55,289
Maybe if I just text her mom,
she will get back to me.

731
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:56,290
No. Off your phone.

732
01:09:56,292 --> 01:09:57,791
- Phone down.
- Okay!

733
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:59,159
- Look, we're gonna have fun.
- Mm hmm.

734
01:09:59,161 --> 01:10:00,327
- Stress-free environment.
- Yep.

735
01:10:00,329 --> 01:10:01,428
- Take this.
- Okay.

736
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:02,963
- Let's go.
- All right. Thank you.

737
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:04,898
Will you excuse me? Sorry.

738
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:05,899
Oops!

739
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:07,236
- Let's go.
- Okay. Yep.

740
01:10:12,408 --> 01:10:14,074
Okay.

741
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:17,678
To a great night with my girls.

742
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:19,515
- To a great night.
- Happy Halloween.

743
01:10:22,685 --> 01:10:23,617
Oh, God.

744
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:25,652
Oh, you're such an amateur.

745
01:10:25,654 --> 01:10:27,287
I do not know
how you drink that shit.

746
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:28,424
Well, chase it.

747
01:10:32,328 --> 01:10:33,860
Oh, you asshole!

748
01:10:33,862 --> 01:10:35,965
Happy Halloween, baby.

749
01:10:38,801 --> 01:10:39,933
You look hot.

750
01:10:39,935 --> 01:10:41,935
Oh, yeah? You like my hair?

751
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:43,537
I do.
How long did that take?

752
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:44,471
You don't wanna know.

753
01:10:44,473 --> 01:10:46,139
Ooh!

754
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:47,808
Yeah, nice shirt.

755
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:48,942
Wishful thinking.

756
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:50,112
I bet!

757
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:54,214
Oh, Jeff.

758
01:10:54,216 --> 01:10:56,149
This is my best friend Sienna.

759
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,484
Hi.

760
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:59,353
Wow. That is a badass outfit.

761
01:10:59,355 --> 01:11:01,188
Thank you.

762
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:02,956
This girl
is unbelievably talented.

763
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:04,491
You have no idea.

764
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:06,860
She made this whole thing
herself, head to toe.

765
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:08,562
What did it take you,
like five months?

766
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:10,230
No. It didn't take that long.

767
01:11:10,232 --> 01:11:11,164
Yes, it did.

768
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:12,899
You have no idea.
It took forever.

769
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,067
You are unbelievable.

770
01:11:14,069 --> 01:11:15,736
You know, honestly,
I feel upstaged.

771
01:11:15,738 --> 01:11:16,637
Okay.

772
01:11:16,639 --> 01:11:18,138
Could you guys please stop?

773
01:11:18,140 --> 01:11:20,707
You're making me feel
a little self-conscious, so...

774
01:11:20,709 --> 01:11:22,242
Oh. Well, a couple
of shots will help that.

775
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,011
- Oh! Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots!
- Shots! Shots! Shots! Shots!

776
01:11:24,013 --> 01:11:26,213
No. No, no, no.
I cannot drink anymore tonight.

777
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:27,914
My mom will get so pissed
if I get fucked up.

778
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,049
No, she won't!

779
01:11:29,051 --> 01:11:31,051
Your mom's gonna be asleep
in two hours.

780
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:33,053
I can't do it.

781
01:11:33,055 --> 01:11:34,821
Okay, fine.

782
01:11:34,823 --> 01:11:36,091
Take a picture of us.

783
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:43,930
Okay.

784
01:11:43,932 --> 01:11:45,766
Ooh, let's dance!

785
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:46,935
Okay.

786
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:15,531
- Trick or treat!
- Trick or treat!

787
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,900
Kids, look how cool!

788
01:12:19,902 --> 01:12:21,270
Oh my God!

789
01:12:22,905 --> 01:12:24,039
So cool.

790
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:29,876
Ew. Why is mine so sticky?

791
01:12:29,878 --> 01:12:31,445
Don't
worry. It's just fake blood.

792
01:12:31,447 --> 01:12:33,814
Just put it in the bag.

793
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:35,284
Ooh, I like it.

794
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:42,124
Ew.

795
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,125
All right, thank you!

796
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:46,126
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

797
01:12:46,128 --> 01:12:48,128
Let's go. Happy Halloween!

798
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,498
- Happy Halloween!
- Happy Halloween!

799
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:13,455
What are you doing in here?

800
01:13:18,260 --> 01:13:19,361
You wanna watch a movie?

801
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:25,465
There is a lot of candy
leftover downstairs.

802
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:27,534
Come on.
I'll let you stay up late.

803
01:13:27,536 --> 01:13:29,836
Go away.

804
01:13:29,838 --> 01:13:31,638
Jonathan.

805
01:13:31,640 --> 01:13:35,308
I am sorry that your plans
were ruined tonight.

806
01:13:35,310 --> 01:13:37,144
I really am.

807
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:38,445
But you should've thought
about this

808
01:13:38,447 --> 01:13:40,714
before you pulled that shit
in school today.

809
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:42,682
I mean, enough's enough.

810
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:44,217
I told you the truth.

811
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:46,520
- I'm not doing this again.
- It wasn't me!

812
01:13:46,522 --> 01:13:50,390
Well, if it wasn't you,
then I sincerely apologize.

813
01:13:50,392 --> 01:13:52,161
But I just don't believe you
anymore.

814
01:13:56,398 --> 01:13:57,731
What about this?

815
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:00,967
Again with this fucking book!

816
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:03,203
Why was Daddy collecting
these news articles?

817
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:05,972
"Slain girl found at carnival."
And this?

818
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:08,408
Look at these drawings!

819
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:09,943
This isn't like Daddy!

820
01:14:09,945 --> 01:14:13,146
He was sick.

821
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:16,249
Why can't you understand?

822
01:14:16,251 --> 01:14:17,417
He didn't know who he was,

823
01:14:17,419 --> 01:14:19,319
or what he was doing
half the time.

824
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,021
And this.

825
01:14:21,023 --> 01:14:24,324
This bullshit is nothing
but a fucking reminder.

826
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:25,227
No!

827
01:14:26,929 --> 01:14:28,997
I want this out of my house.

828
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:41,777
You're such a bitch!

829
01:14:44,246 --> 01:14:47,015
Don't you ever say that
to me again!

830
01:14:50,018 --> 01:14:52,052
Jonathan.
Jonathan, you get back here.

831
01:14:52,054 --> 01:14:53,255
Jonathan!

832
01:15:18,780 --> 01:15:20,280
I'll be right back.

833
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:22,616
Wait. Where are you going?

834
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:23,919
I'm gonna grab a drink.

835
01:16:01,957 --> 01:16:05,127
- Yo, can I get a selfie?
- Sure.

836
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:08,964
Fuck, yeah, girl!

837
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,699
What?

838
01:17:20,035 --> 01:17:21,236
What?

839
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:29,778
Oh, my God.

840
01:17:36,585 --> 01:17:39,119
Sienna!

841
01:17:39,121 --> 01:17:41,056
- Hey!
- Hi!

842
01:17:42,958 --> 01:17:44,459
I missed you, girl.

843
01:17:45,894 --> 01:17:46,793
Hi.

844
01:17:46,795 --> 01:17:49,095
No, wait.

845
01:17:49,097 --> 01:17:50,864
- Feel this.
- Oh.

846
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:52,467
Oh.

847
01:17:54,903 --> 01:17:56,736
- Oh, my God.
- No, no. Wait.

848
01:17:56,738 --> 01:17:59,372
You don't understand.
I want it.

849
01:17:59,374 --> 01:18:01,608
- I know.
- I wanna like...

850
01:18:01,610 --> 01:18:02,544
live in it, you know?

851
01:18:05,747 --> 01:18:08,948
- How are you feeling?
- Good.

852
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:10,283
Yeah?

853
01:18:10,285 --> 01:18:12,652
- So good actually!
- Okay.

854
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:14,454
I feel like...

855
01:18:14,456 --> 01:18:16,056
that shot's really starting
to hit me.

856
01:18:16,058 --> 01:18:18,625
Well, whiskey will do that
to you.

857
01:18:18,627 --> 01:18:20,326
- I needed this.
- Yeah.

858
01:18:20,328 --> 01:18:21,594
You were right.

859
01:18:21,596 --> 01:18:23,129
- You were so right.
- Yeah.

860
01:18:23,131 --> 01:18:28,301
I needed to just, like get out,
and stop thinking,

861
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:31,673
worrying about every little
thing in my life.

862
01:18:33,341 --> 01:18:35,175
Like... like this costume.

863
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:36,509
Yeah.

864
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:38,178
I mean,
it should be a happy thing.

865
01:18:38,180 --> 01:18:39,581
- Yeah.
- You know?

866
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,285
It reminds me of my Dad.

867
01:18:44,986 --> 01:18:47,420
He used to...

868
01:18:47,422 --> 01:18:50,623
He used to draw this character
for me when I was a little girl.

869
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:52,158
He used to tell me
I was gonna grow up

870
01:18:52,160 --> 01:18:54,427
to be like her one day.

871
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,362
And I really believed it.

872
01:18:56,364 --> 01:18:57,330
Well, look at you now!

873
01:18:57,332 --> 01:18:58,531
You are her.

874
01:18:58,533 --> 01:18:59,999
I am nothing like her.

875
01:19:00,001 --> 01:19:01,034
I'm not courageous.

876
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:02,235
I'm not brave.

877
01:19:02,237 --> 01:19:04,637
I mean, I literally
had a panic attack today

878
01:19:04,639 --> 01:19:06,372
in school in front of everybody.

879
01:19:06,374 --> 01:19:10,543
I put molly in your drink.

880
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:13,313
What?

881
01:19:13,315 --> 01:19:15,515
I did. I put a half a tablet
in your drink,

882
01:19:15,517 --> 01:19:16,516
the other half in mine.

883
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:18,118
Not even really,
it was kind of nothing.

884
01:19:18,120 --> 01:19:19,786
But it's fine,
'cause I'm also on it.

885
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:21,454
So, we're totally fine.
You and me.

886
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:25,026
And that is why you feel
like you're on molly.

887
01:19:26,228 --> 01:19:27,494
'Cause you are.

888
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:28,728
Right now.

889
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:30,363
You fuckin' bitch!

890
01:19:30,365 --> 01:19:32,031
What the...

891
01:19:32,033 --> 01:19:34,167
- That is so messed up!
- I did it.

892
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:35,401
I made you feel better,
didn't I?

893
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,470
I'm fucking pissed.

894
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:38,705
No, don't be pissed.

895
01:19:38,707 --> 01:19:39,973
You're smiling.
You can't be pissed.

896
01:19:39,975 --> 01:19:41,474
No, bitch. I'm not smiling.

897
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:42,844
You're totally smiling.

898
01:19:44,513 --> 01:19:46,748
So, we gotta go back out,
and we gotta dance.

899
01:20:47,209 --> 01:20:47,976
Jonathan.

900
01:20:50,245 --> 01:20:53,415
Jonathan, please get back.

901
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,252
Jonathan!

902
01:21:05,160 --> 01:21:06,893
Oh, shit.

903
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,761
What?

904
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:11,431
My mom called me like six times.

905
01:21:11,433 --> 01:21:13,600
- Ooh. Do not call her back.
- I'm gonna see...

906
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:15,134
- Don't call her back!
- Shh, shh, shh!

907
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:17,437
Sienna. Sienna.

908
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:18,638
- Sienna.
- Hey!

909
01:21:18,640 --> 01:21:21,243
- Stop it.
- He's dead, Sienna!

910
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:23,509
Wait. What?

911
01:21:23,511 --> 01:21:24,779
Cut the call.

912
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:26,579
Wait, mom.
Mom, I can't hear you.

913
01:21:26,581 --> 01:21:27,949
Just...

914
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:31,351
Um, sorry.

915
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:34,020
Um, what'd you say?

916
01:21:34,022 --> 01:21:38,024
He covered the entire
fucking car with shaving cream!

917
01:21:38,026 --> 01:21:39,092
What?

918
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:40,994
Yeah! The whole fucking thing.

919
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,765
Shaving cream, toilet paper,
eggs. He's dead!

920
01:21:45,934 --> 01:21:46,668
He...

921
01:21:48,603 --> 01:21:50,203
Jonathan wouldn't do that.

922
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:52,438
Yeah. He didn't do this.

923
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,142
Just like he didn't vandalize
the school this morning!

924
01:21:56,144 --> 01:21:58,278
Look at this.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

925
01:21:58,280 --> 01:22:01,347
This... this is crazy now.

926
01:22:01,349 --> 01:22:03,316
He's going to that psychiatrist
immediately.

927
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:05,685
I cannot deal with him anymore.

928
01:22:05,687 --> 01:22:06,886
Really, mom?

929
01:22:06,888 --> 01:22:08,221
You're gonna send him
to a shrink

930
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:10,823
because what, he put like
a little bit of shaving cream

931
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:12,458
on your car?

932
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,494
I'm glad you think
this is funny, Sienna.

933
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:15,828
It's just shaving cream.

934
01:22:15,830 --> 01:22:17,864
It's not like he took
a baseball bat

935
01:22:17,866 --> 01:22:19,365
to your windshield.

936
01:22:19,367 --> 01:22:22,001
It's Halloween. I mean...

937
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:23,405
Are you drunk?

938
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,307
- No.
- Yes, you are.

939
01:22:27,309 --> 01:22:31,577
I can hear it in your voice.
How many drinks have you had?

940
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:34,080
I... I thought we were talking
about Jonathan.

941
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:36,082
Sienna, so help me,

942
01:22:36,084 --> 01:22:38,918
if you come home plastered
on top of everything else

943
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:41,554
- I'm dealing with tonight...
- No.

944
01:22:41,556 --> 01:22:44,657
I swear to God, I'm not drunk.
I'll even take a breathalyzer.

945
01:22:44,659 --> 01:22:45,591
You're killing me.

946
01:22:45,593 --> 01:22:46,893
You know that?

947
01:22:46,895 --> 01:22:49,698
You and your brother both,
I have had it.

948
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,032
I love you.

949
01:22:53,034 --> 01:22:57,503
Yeah, Sienna, I am warning you.

950
01:22:57,505 --> 01:22:59,105
No. Really, mom.

951
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:01,276
I... I love you. I...

952
01:23:03,345 --> 01:23:04,612
I don't say it enough.

953
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:08,883
I love you, too.

954
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:15,423
Go and enjoy your party.
I'm... I'm sorry to bother you.

955
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:19,058
And listen.

956
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,561
Everything will be okay
with Jonathan.

957
01:23:21,563 --> 01:23:23,096
I promise.

958
01:23:23,098 --> 01:23:26,199
Just remember what I said.

959
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:28,468
Be careful getting home,
all right?

960
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:31,139
I will. Bye.

961
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:37,746
Happy Halloween, motherfuckers!

962
01:23:39,214 --> 01:23:42,315
- How'd it go?
- Fine.

963
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,583
All right.

964
01:23:43,585 --> 01:23:45,885
Let me give you a little
molly etiquette here.

965
01:23:45,887 --> 01:23:49,722
Rule number one, you never

966
01:23:49,724 --> 01:23:53,626
ever call your mother
when you're rolling on molly.

967
01:23:53,628 --> 01:23:56,262
Okay? Your mother, never.
All right?

968
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:58,431
Rule number two,

969
01:23:58,433 --> 01:24:01,136
you don't fucking let it go
to waste. Come on.

970
01:24:14,816 --> 01:24:17,517
Look at this.

971
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:21,156
Did he really think
he was gonna get away with this?

972
01:24:23,191 --> 01:24:26,361
He is in for a rude awakening.

973
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:30,999
Things are gonna change.

974
01:24:49,784 --> 01:24:54,789
♪ Pain, always pain ♪

975
01:24:57,225 --> 01:25:02,664
♪ Pain, always pain ♪

976
01:25:04,866 --> 01:25:07,133
♪ Pain makes the rhythm,
makes the rhythm ♪

977
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:08,534
♪ Makes the rhythm ♪

978
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:11,003
♪ Pain, pain makes the rhythm,
makes the rhythm ♪

979
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:12,338
♪ Makes the rhythm, pain ♪

980
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:13,541
Do you see that?

981
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:20,348
There. There.
That little girl.

982
01:25:22,317 --> 01:25:23,816
What is she saying?

983
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:25,487
What are you talking about?

984
01:25:28,823 --> 01:25:30,356
I... I... I swear to God.

985
01:25:30,358 --> 01:25:32,024
She was right there.
I... I saw her.

986
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:33,459
She was...
She was... she was right there.

987
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,430
Okay. Come on.
It's bathroom time.

988
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:41,100
Sienna? Sienna?

989
01:25:41,102 --> 01:25:43,336
Okay. Sienna, look at me.
It's okay. Shh, shh, shh.

990
01:25:43,338 --> 01:25:46,841
Sienna, breathe. Breathe.
Breathe. You're gonna be okay.

991
01:25:49,444 --> 01:25:50,745
Sienna?

992
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:01,923
Mom!

993
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:17,765
Help me!

994
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:22,597
I'm sorry you had to leave.

995
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:24,766
It's no problem.

996
01:28:26,534 --> 01:28:28,868
You okay?

997
01:28:28,870 --> 01:28:31,370
Sienna, what the fuck was that
back there?

998
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:32,238
I'm fine.

999
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,572
Are you fucking kidding me?

1000
01:28:33,574 --> 01:28:35,041
No! You're not fine.

1001
01:28:35,043 --> 01:28:37,777
You are so completely far
from fine right now.

1002
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:39,045
You're just totally freaked out.

1003
01:28:39,047 --> 01:28:40,713
Gee, Brooke. I wonder why.

1004
01:28:40,715 --> 01:28:42,648
Oh! Don't blame this on me.

1005
01:28:42,650 --> 01:28:44,216
I'm on the same shit as you
right now, okay?

1006
01:28:44,218 --> 01:28:45,584
- I'm not freaking out.
- Whoa!

1007
01:28:45,586 --> 01:28:48,020
What are we talking
about here? What shit?

1008
01:28:48,022 --> 01:28:49,922
I put a pinch of molly
in her drink.

1009
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:51,357
It was nothing.

1010
01:28:51,359 --> 01:28:52,792
- Plus Xanax.
- What?

1011
01:28:52,794 --> 01:28:54,360
I did not give you Xanax.

1012
01:28:54,362 --> 01:28:57,697
No, she was already on Xanax,
which I didn't know about, okay?

1013
01:28:57,699 --> 01:28:59,031
Let's make that perfectly
fucking clear.

1014
01:28:59,033 --> 01:29:00,900
You could've fucking killed me.

1015
01:29:00,902 --> 01:29:03,402
I was trying to do
something nice for you.

1016
01:29:03,404 --> 01:29:04,737
Jesus Christ!

1017
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:06,541
You're like Ms. Morbid
all the time.

1018
01:29:08,376 --> 01:29:10,409
Thanks.

1019
01:29:10,411 --> 01:29:11,412
Just take me home.

1020
01:29:14,315 --> 01:29:16,982
Sienna, whatever happened
back there was not normal.

1021
01:29:16,984 --> 01:29:18,284
Okay?

1022
01:29:18,286 --> 01:29:20,286
You could have had like
a brain aneurysm,

1023
01:29:20,288 --> 01:29:22,054
or seizure, or something.

1024
01:29:22,056 --> 01:29:23,723
What if it happens again?

1025
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:25,057
Wanna take her
to the emergency room?

1026
01:29:25,059 --> 01:29:26,892
I... I just...
I just wanna go home.

1027
01:29:26,894 --> 01:29:28,563
Just take me home.

1028
01:29:31,232 --> 01:29:33,466
If that's your mother,
do not answer it.

1029
01:29:33,468 --> 01:29:34,600
Hello.

1030
01:29:34,602 --> 01:29:35,501
Sienna, I'm in trouble.

1031
01:29:35,503 --> 01:29:36,902
Oh, you think?

1032
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:38,137
Mommy told me
what you did to her car,

1033
01:29:38,139 --> 01:29:39,338
you little asshole.

1034
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:40,906
I mean, really?

1035
01:29:40,908 --> 01:29:41,741
No.
I need your help.

1036
01:29:41,743 --> 01:29:43,244
You have to come get me.

1037
01:29:44,645 --> 01:29:46,412
What do you mean?

1038
01:29:46,414 --> 01:29:47,680
What's wrong?

1039
01:29:47,682 --> 01:29:49,148
Where are you?

1040
01:29:49,150 --> 01:29:50,883
I'm at the old carnival.

1041
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:54,253
Eric and Sean left me here.
I'm all alone.

1042
01:29:54,255 --> 01:29:55,955
What's wrong with you?

1043
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:58,124
Please.
I'm really scared.

1044
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:01,026
I don't know what else to do.
I can't call mommy.

1045
01:30:01,028 --> 01:30:02,595
Okay. Um, all right. Calm down.

1046
01:30:02,597 --> 01:30:04,430
I'll come get you, okay?

1047
01:30:04,432 --> 01:30:05,831
Hurry, my phone is dying.

1048
01:30:05,833 --> 01:30:08,768
All right. Just wait
by the main entrance, okay?

1049
01:30:08,770 --> 01:30:12,039
Jonathan? Jonathan? J...

1050
01:30:13,007 --> 01:30:14,609
Goddammit.

1051
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:17,877
He's bullshitting you.

1052
01:30:17,879 --> 01:30:19,111
No, he's not.

1053
01:30:19,113 --> 01:30:20,312
Yes, he is.

1054
01:30:20,314 --> 01:30:21,380
It's Halloween.

1055
01:30:21,382 --> 01:30:22,715
Are you really telling me
right now

1056
01:30:22,717 --> 01:30:24,450
that it's beneath your brother
to do something twisted

1057
01:30:24,452 --> 01:30:26,452
like this?
Come on. The old carnival.

1058
01:30:26,454 --> 01:30:28,020
No. I... I know
when Jonathan's lying. Okay?

1059
01:30:28,022 --> 01:30:29,822
I... I could hear it
in his voice.

1060
01:30:29,824 --> 01:30:31,857
Something's... something's wrong.

1061
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:34,059
Sienna! Like, dude...

1062
01:30:34,061 --> 01:30:35,997
It's only a few miles from here.

1063
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,336
This is so stupid.

1064
01:30:46,641 --> 01:30:48,874
Great. Fine. Whatever.
I don't care.

1065
01:30:48,876 --> 01:30:50,878
It's not like this night
can get any worse.

1066
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:26,378
Well, where is he?

1067
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:29,381
I told him to wait in front.

1068
01:31:29,383 --> 01:31:32,685
- How old's your brother?
- 12.

1069
01:31:32,687 --> 01:31:33,786
Even the fact that
he's out here right now

1070
01:31:33,788 --> 01:31:35,387
should be telling you something.

1071
01:31:35,389 --> 01:31:36,922
Didn't like a little girl
get murdered out here

1072
01:31:36,924 --> 01:31:39,193
a couple years ago?

1073
01:31:43,965 --> 01:31:45,764
I'm gonna go look for him.

1074
01:31:45,766 --> 01:31:47,700
What?

1075
01:31:47,702 --> 01:31:49,270
Sienna? Get back in the car.

1076
01:31:50,471 --> 01:31:52,406
Sienna!

1077
01:32:01,282 --> 01:32:02,416
She's crazy.

1078
01:32:11,659 --> 01:32:12,927
Jonathan!

1079
01:32:17,265 --> 01:32:18,399
Jonathan!

1080
01:32:20,668 --> 01:32:22,001
Maybe we should go with her.

1081
01:32:22,003 --> 01:32:23,802
Fuck that.
I guarantee you,

1082
01:32:23,804 --> 01:32:26,438
her brother's just gonna scare
the shit out of her.

1083
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,573
He's turned
into a complete psycho

1084
01:32:27,575 --> 01:32:29,475
ever since his father
killed himself.

1085
01:32:29,477 --> 01:32:30,809
Ever since what?

1086
01:32:30,811 --> 01:32:32,144
No joke.

1087
01:32:32,146 --> 01:32:33,746
He had like
this giant brain tumor

1088
01:32:33,748 --> 01:32:35,748
that I don't know,
it just made him do

1089
01:32:35,750 --> 01:32:38,284
all this fucked-up shit.

1090
01:32:38,286 --> 01:32:39,618
And he was like seeing things.

1091
01:32:39,620 --> 01:32:43,122
And he got really abusive
towards the end.

1092
01:32:43,124 --> 01:32:45,691
Especially towards Sienna.

1093
01:32:45,693 --> 01:32:48,027
And then one day,

1094
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:49,628
he drank a whole bottle of Jack,

1095
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:51,130
and he got in his car,
and he drove straight

1096
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:54,333
into one of those
transformer things.

1097
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:56,669
And the car caught fire,
and he got trapped in the wreck.

1098
01:32:56,671 --> 01:32:58,039
And he burned to death.

1099
01:33:01,008 --> 01:33:04,677
You could hear him screaming
from a mile away.

1100
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:06,679
Well, I've only known
your friend for a few hours,

1101
01:33:06,681 --> 01:33:09,648
but that explains a lot.

1102
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:11,016
Yeah.

1103
01:33:11,018 --> 01:33:14,155
All things considered,
I think she's doing pretty well.

1104
01:33:39,046 --> 01:33:40,982
Come on, answer me.

1105
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:44,049
Where are you?

1106
01:33:44,051 --> 01:33:45,818
I'm searching
all over the place.

1107
01:33:45,820 --> 01:33:47,519
Help.

1108
01:33:47,521 --> 01:33:49,490
Jonathan, can you hear me?

1109
01:33:51,025 --> 01:33:52,758
I can't...

1110
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:54,093
Listen.

1111
01:33:54,095 --> 01:33:56,063
I'm gonna wait for you
by the merry-go-round, okay?

1112
01:33:56,897 --> 01:33:58,497
Did you hear what I said?

1113
01:33:58,499 --> 01:34:00,001
Meet me at the merry-go-round.

1114
01:34:01,335 --> 01:34:03,068
Hello?

1115
01:34:03,070 --> 01:34:04,405
Text me back.

1116
01:35:32,626 --> 01:35:34,693
What is that?

1117
01:35:34,695 --> 01:35:36,929
A little pick-me-up.

1118
01:35:36,931 --> 01:35:39,431
Wow, Jeff. Okay.

1119
01:35:39,433 --> 01:35:41,166
Don't let Sienna see that shit.

1120
01:35:41,168 --> 01:35:44,036
Well, we'll just have to do it
before she comes back.

1121
01:35:44,038 --> 01:35:45,137
I'm not doing that.

1122
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:46,338
You ever try it?

1123
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:47,773
Yeah. Once. I didn't like it.

1124
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:50,142
Oh sure, impossible. Come on.

1125
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:51,378
This will put us
right back in the club.

1126
01:35:53,714 --> 01:35:55,647
Fuck.

1127
01:35:55,649 --> 01:35:56,484
Trust me.

1128
01:35:59,220 --> 01:36:00,686
Okay.

1129
01:36:00,688 --> 01:36:01,553
All right. Fuck it.

1130
01:36:01,555 --> 01:36:03,355
Um...

1131
01:36:03,357 --> 01:36:05,057
okay.

1132
01:36:05,059 --> 01:36:07,461
Ugh!

1133
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:13,701
That tastes weird.

1134
01:36:28,215 --> 01:36:29,216
Jonathan?

1135
01:36:51,205 --> 01:36:52,337
What's wrong?

1136
01:36:52,339 --> 01:36:53,272
Where the hell is she?

1137
01:36:53,274 --> 01:36:54,375
Who cares?

1138
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:00,848
Wait.

1139
01:37:03,083 --> 01:37:04,283
All right.
Look, but, like, seriously,

1140
01:37:04,285 --> 01:37:05,250
what time did she leave?

1141
01:37:05,252 --> 01:37:07,421
- Well, who cares?
- Okay.

1142
01:37:10,424 --> 01:37:14,426
Okay. I'm gonna call her
really fast, okay?

1143
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:16,397
Just really quick.

1144
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:20,599
Where are you going?

1145
01:37:20,601 --> 01:37:22,301
I have to go pee-pee.

1146
01:37:22,303 --> 01:37:23,635
You wanna hold it?

1147
01:37:23,637 --> 01:37:25,039
Ew. Leave.

1148
01:37:33,247 --> 01:37:34,313
Hi. It's Sienna.

1149
01:37:34,315 --> 01:37:37,182
Leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.

1150
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:38,083
The mailbox is full...

1151
01:37:38,085 --> 01:37:39,618
Unbelievable.

1152
01:37:39,620 --> 01:37:40,552
...and cannot accept
any messages at this time.

1153
01:37:40,554 --> 01:37:41,388
Goodbye...

1154
01:37:42,223 --> 01:37:45,591
Asshole!

1155
01:37:45,593 --> 01:37:46,627
That's twice!

1156
01:37:48,195 --> 01:37:49,330
Oh, it's so funny.

1157
01:37:50,731 --> 01:37:51,730
Yeah, you're so funny.

1158
01:37:51,732 --> 01:37:52,631
You know
what's actually really funny?

1159
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:53,599
- Mm.
- Mm.

1160
01:37:53,601 --> 01:37:55,767
Let me see here. Oh.

1161
01:37:55,769 --> 01:37:57,469
Oh, hey. Don't fuck her up.

1162
01:37:57,471 --> 01:37:58,971
- Come on.
- Oh.

1163
01:37:58,973 --> 01:38:01,306
- Oh, you better say sorry.
- I'm sorry.

1164
01:38:01,308 --> 01:38:02,641
And I don't really know

1165
01:38:02,643 --> 01:38:05,077
if you can snort this
out of an ashtray.

1166
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:06,478
It'd be kinda hard to snort
out of.

1167
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,480
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I won't do it again, I promise.

1168
01:38:08,482 --> 01:38:10,148
Are you actually sorry?

1169
01:38:10,150 --> 01:38:12,084
Hey.

1170
01:38:12,086 --> 01:38:13,619
Okay, fine.

1171
01:38:13,621 --> 01:38:15,289
But you're a jerk.

1172
01:38:50,224 --> 01:38:50,991
Jeff?

1173
01:38:53,861 --> 01:38:54,995
Oh, my God!

1174
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:03,704
No! No, no!

1175
01:39:07,374 --> 01:39:09,310
No! No, no!

1176
01:39:19,453 --> 01:39:20,421
Oh, my God!

1177
01:39:43,944 --> 01:39:45,579
Oh, my God!

1178
01:39:55,022 --> 01:39:56,890
Sienna!

1179
01:39:58,425 --> 01:39:59,925
Oh, God!

1180
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,295
Sienna!

1181
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:06,300
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1182
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:54,348
Jonathan!

1183
01:41:00,020 --> 01:41:01,655
Can you hear me?

1184
01:41:16,937 --> 01:41:18,439
Somebody, please!

1185
01:41:19,640 --> 01:41:20,541
Help me!

1186
01:41:28,949 --> 01:41:30,951
Sienna!

1187
01:41:36,824 --> 01:41:37,958
Help!

1188
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:41,161
Brooke!

1189
01:42:32,779 --> 01:42:35,749
Oh, my God! No, please! No!

1190
01:42:53,934 --> 01:42:57,636
Stay back. Stop. Please stop.
Stay away from me!

1191
01:42:57,638 --> 01:42:59,938
Don't, please!

1192
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:04,509
Wait, wait.
No! Please, please stop! No!

1193
01:43:04,511 --> 01:43:08,815
No, no, no, no!
Stop it. Stop. No. Please!

1194
01:43:12,386 --> 01:43:14,753
No. Stay back.
Don't... don't come near me.

1195
01:43:14,755 --> 01:43:16,890
Please don't.
No, no, no!

1196
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:24,658
Brooke!

1197
01:44:29,029 --> 01:44:30,564
Brooke!

1198
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:44,177
Brooke.

1199
01:45:30,090 --> 01:45:31,191
Jonathan?

1200
01:45:42,135 --> 01:45:43,136
Jonathan, run!

1201
01:49:45,612 --> 01:49:46,546
Come on.

1202
01:50:06,666 --> 01:50:07,834
This way.

1203
01:50:12,973 --> 01:50:14,474
Sienna.

1204
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,310
You're hurt bad.

1205
01:50:19,312 --> 01:50:22,246
I'm all right. I'm all right.
Let me... let me see you.

1206
01:50:22,248 --> 01:50:24,250
Are you okay?

1207
01:50:25,552 --> 01:50:27,352
Oh, my God.

1208
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:28,753
You were right.

1209
01:50:28,755 --> 01:50:30,390
You were right about everything.

1210
01:50:32,025 --> 01:50:33,426
I was right about you, too.

1211
01:50:34,427 --> 01:50:36,260
About what?

1212
01:50:36,262 --> 01:50:38,329
They used me to get you here.

1213
01:50:38,331 --> 01:50:40,431
They need you in this place
for a reason.

1214
01:50:40,433 --> 01:50:42,233
What are you saying that?

1215
01:50:42,235 --> 01:50:44,235
It's what Daddy saw.

1216
01:50:44,237 --> 01:50:48,039
I think you're the only one
who can stop him.

1217
01:50:48,041 --> 01:50:48,842
Why?

1218
01:50:52,712 --> 01:50:53,747
I don't know.

1219
01:50:56,583 --> 01:50:59,219
Well, we gotta find a way
out of here.

1220
01:51:04,257 --> 01:51:05,358
Okay, come on.

1221
01:51:35,922 --> 01:51:36,990
Wait here.

1222
01:53:15,255 --> 01:53:17,190
Jonathan.

1223
01:54:26,926 --> 01:54:28,127
Sucker!

1224
01:55:12,639 --> 01:55:13,706
Jonathan...

1225
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:24,110
Sienna!

1226
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:31,082
Sienna. Sienna, wake up.

1227
01:56:31,084 --> 01:56:35,521
Stay with me. Stay with me!
Please don't go.

1228
01:56:37,190 --> 01:56:40,024
Sienna.
Please don't leave me.

1229
01:56:40,026 --> 01:56:44,464
Sienna. Baby, wake up.

1230
01:56:47,567 --> 01:56:48,368
Mom?

1231
01:56:53,539 --> 01:56:55,908
Sweetie, it's okay.

1232
01:56:57,343 --> 01:56:58,211
You're safe.

1233
01:57:01,581 --> 01:57:02,482
Mom.

1234
01:57:08,354 --> 01:57:10,957
Oh, shh, shh, shh.

1235
01:57:12,125 --> 01:57:13,726
Everything's gonna be okay.

1236
01:57:16,295 --> 01:57:18,664
I thought
I was never gonna see you again.

1237
01:57:20,266 --> 01:57:21,000
Oh.

1238
01:57:26,272 --> 01:57:29,909
Jonathan told you...
didn't he?

1239
01:57:33,179 --> 01:57:34,080
What?

1240
01:57:34,814 --> 01:57:36,180
Sienna!

1241
01:57:36,182 --> 01:57:38,317
Get away from her!
That's not Mommy!

1242
01:58:21,727 --> 01:58:23,663
Jonathan!

1243
01:58:31,070 --> 01:58:33,139
No! No!

1244
01:58:35,541 --> 01:58:38,211
No! No, you tucker!

1245
01:59:06,739 --> 01:59:08,174
Fuck you.

1246
02:01:51,671 --> 02:01:53,937
Speaking of some prizes, kids,

1247
02:01:53,939 --> 02:01:56,609
we have a very special guest
with us today.

1248
02:02:46,959 --> 02:02:48,427

Sienna.

1257
02:08:36,642 --> 02:08:37,509
You got him.

1258
02:08:39,812 --> 02:08:41,580
It's over now. Okay?

1259
02:08:42,281 --> 02:08:43,348
Okay.

1260
02:11:54,439 --> 02:11:56,206
Please tell me
this is pumpkin spice.

1261
02:11:56,208 --> 02:11:58,510
Not a chance in hell.

1262
02:12:01,880 --> 02:12:02,848
What is this?

1263
02:12:04,182 --> 02:12:07,185
Zombie platter.
My wife made it.

1264
02:12:12,724 --> 02:12:14,724
That's disgusting.

1265
02:12:14,726 --> 02:12:16,359
Creative, but disgusting.

1266
02:12:16,361 --> 02:12:18,161
I wouldn't say
that before you try it.

1267
02:12:18,163 --> 02:12:19,529
It's pretty tasty.

1268
02:12:19,531 --> 02:12:21,133
Mm. No, thanks.

1269
02:12:34,313 --> 02:12:36,379
As appealing
as that brain looks,

1270
02:12:36,381 --> 02:12:39,049
I don't really have the stomach
for it right now.

1271
02:12:39,051 --> 02:12:41,384
Everything okay?

1272
02:12:41,386 --> 02:12:44,020
I've been tending to our
celebrity patient all day.

1273
02:12:44,022 --> 02:12:45,221
Is that bad?

1274
02:12:45,223 --> 02:12:46,389
Let's just say her face

1275
02:12:46,391 --> 02:12:48,327
doesn't stimulate
one's appetite.

1276
02:13:00,272 --> 02:13:03,106
- What's she like?
- Tame.

1277
02:13:03,108 --> 02:13:05,010
Pretty cooperative actually.

1278
02:13:05,777 --> 02:13:08,180
It's kind of hard to imagine
she ripped that woman to pieces.

1279
02:13:21,059 --> 02:13:22,759
Pass me one of those eyeballs.

1280
02:13:22,761 --> 02:13:23,528
Huh?

1281
02:13:24,930 --> 02:13:27,366
And, uh, put some
of that brain jelly on it, too.

1282
02:13:32,804 --> 02:13:36,139
And, Lola, don't be stingy.
Oh. There it is. There you go.

1283
02:13:36,141 --> 02:13:37,042
Little more.

1284
02:13:40,879 --> 02:13:43,315
Thank you.
Diet starts tomorrow, so...

1285
02:13:51,323 --> 02:13:52,057
Mm!

1286
02:13:55,961 --> 02:13:56,762
Mm.

1287
02:14:05,303 --> 02:14:07,270
- What is that?
- Hmm?

1288
02:14:07,272 --> 02:14:08,605
That song
you're singing, what is it?

1289
02:14:08,607 --> 02:14:09,408
Oh.

1290
02:14:10,075 --> 02:14:12,108
I have no idea actually.

1291
02:14:12,110 --> 02:14:13,410
Victoria's been singing it
all day.

1292
02:14:13,412 --> 02:14:16,312
I can't get it out of my head.

1293
