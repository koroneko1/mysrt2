[man] <i>"Jack Quartermaine
knew he was a dead man."</i>

00:49.334 --> 00:53.738
<i>No, no, no, no. "Jack Quartermaine
thought he was a dead man."</i>

00:53.740 --> 00:58.509
<i>No, no. "Jack Quartermaine
feared he was a dead man."</i>

00:58.511 --> 01:00.378
<i>Suspected.</i>

01:00.380 --> 01:02.046
<i>Imagined?</i>

01:02.048 --> 01:05.285
Come on, Frank.
Make up your mind!

01:25.806 --> 01:27.675
What are you smilin' about?

01:28.642 --> 01:31.411
[boy] Dad, Grandpa's here!
[car horn honks]

01:31.812 --> 01:33.447
[sighs]

01:36.650 --> 01:38.419
Welcome to your new home, Dad.

01:39.520 --> 01:41.623
Smaller than I remember.

01:45.392 --> 01:47.061
Sure got a lot of stuff,
Grandpa.

01:48.697 --> 01:50.830
I can do that, Jordie.
I'm not an invalid.

01:50.832 --> 01:52.632
Nobody thinks you're
an invalid, Eddie.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.267
- Just want you to feel welcome.
- Eduardo.

01:55.269 --> 01:58.507
- Huh?
- It's Eduardo, not Eddie.

01:59.474 --> 02:02.511
Right. But, you know,
I could call you Dad.

02:05.347 --> 02:07.280
Okay, Eduardo it is.

02:07.282 --> 02:09.816
All right.
This is the last of it.

02:09.818 --> 02:12.452
[grunts] Took you long enough.
Oh, oh, whoa.

02:12.454 --> 02:14.087
Uh-huh. Okay.

02:14.089 --> 02:17.157
Boy.
You know where I got this?

02:17.159 --> 02:19.559
Judge Phillips,
state supreme court.

02:19.561 --> 02:23.162
He gave me this when I appeared
before him on a federal case.

02:23.164 --> 02:25.566
Said he never heard
a more solid argument

02:25.568 --> 02:27.501
from an attorney
in his whole career.

02:27.503 --> 02:28.569
Hmm.

02:28.571 --> 02:30.604
Oh. Wow.

02:30.606 --> 02:33.207
Well, I hope you
don't mind bunk beds.

02:33.209 --> 02:35.876
Nah. I got used to
bunk beds, you know...

02:35.878 --> 02:38.713
In the joint?
I prefer "the slammer."

02:38.715 --> 02:41.818
All right, I gotta get back to work,
so I'll let you roommates settle in.

02:53.897 --> 02:55.799
Dad. Dad?
Yeah?

02:57.367 --> 03:00.070
Exactly how long is
Grandpa gonna be staying here?

03:01.705 --> 03:03.505
I don't really know, Son.

03:03.507 --> 03:05.443
Dad, I need my space.

03:06.877 --> 03:10.445
Of course you do. Look... your mother
and I are gonna work something out, okay?

03:10.447 --> 03:12.314
But in the meantime,
we're stuck with him.

03:12.316 --> 03:14.316
So make the best
of it, all right?

03:14.318 --> 03:15.787
Whatever.

03:26.431 --> 03:27.798
Potatoes are a little salty.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.568
[exhales]

03:30.835 --> 03:33.669
I just put a bit in the water, Dad.
To give it some flavor.

03:33.671 --> 03:36.172
[chuckling]

03:36.174 --> 03:39.277
Salt's no good for ya.
It makes you retain fluid.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.748
Weakens the muscle. You end
up lookin' like your dad.

03:45.383 --> 03:47.183
I still weigh the same
as I did in the joint.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.220
Here, feel that.

03:50.589 --> 03:53.190
So, any plans tomorrow, Dad?

03:53.192 --> 03:55.358
Ah, you know, the usual.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.461
Meet up with
a couple of friends...

03:57.463 --> 04:00.564
have some coffee,
complain about the weather.

04:00.566 --> 04:03.202
Well, I'll be teaching tomorrow,
but maybe Frank can drive you.

04:04.236 --> 04:06.405
Mm-mm.
Frank's gotta write.

04:08.942 --> 04:11.508
You still keepin'
up with that, huh?

04:11.510 --> 04:13.312
Let's see...
What was your last book?

04:15.248 --> 04:17.814
<i>The Copenhagen Conundrum.</i>

04:17.815 --> 04:19.483
That was, what,
ten years ago?

04:19.485 --> 04:21.887
- Five.
- Oh.

04:22.489 --> 04:24.422
Eh, close enough.

04:24.424 --> 04:27.594
Thought you would've
given up on that by now.

04:29.763 --> 04:31.431
Bird's dry.

04:49.383 --> 04:51.383
[Frank] I don't think
this is gonna work.

04:51.385 --> 04:52.852
What do you mean?

04:52.854 --> 04:55.020
Well, for one thing,
I'm not sure I'm comfortable

04:55.022 --> 04:57.356
livin' with an ex-con
under our roof.

04:57.358 --> 05:00.626
That is my father
you're talking about, Frank.

05:00.628 --> 05:02.862
And that was a long time ago.

05:02.864 --> 05:04.931
He paid his debt to society.

05:04.933 --> 05:07.666
He even got his law degree
when he was in jail.

05:07.668 --> 05:09.268
Doesn't that
count for something?

05:09.270 --> 05:10.970
Well, if he's such
a hotshot lawyer,

05:10.972 --> 05:13.039
why can't he stay
in his apartment?

05:13.041 --> 05:17.377
Because he almost burned it down
when he forgot to turn off the stove.

05:17.379 --> 05:19.278
Oh, that.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.914
And then
the neighbors complained

05:20.916 --> 05:23.450
about him knocking
on their doors at all hours

05:23.452 --> 05:25.785
tryin' to get into
the wrong apartment.

05:25.787 --> 05:29.355
And when the landlord found him
sleeping under the fountain...

05:29.357 --> 05:31.391
he said it was
the last straw.

05:31.393 --> 05:33.428
Yeah.
Well, if it's that bad, honey...

05:34.796 --> 05:37.430
maybe it's time that
we put him in a home.

05:37.432 --> 05:40.501
[laughs]
He is in a home.

05:40.503 --> 05:42.237
Our home.

05:43.973 --> 05:46.406
Don't worry
about Dad, hmm?

05:46.408 --> 05:48.745
You probably won't even
notice that he's here.

05:49.545 --> 05:52.615
[Eduardo snoring]

05:53.617 --> 05:55.952
[snoring continues]

06:11.034 --> 06:13.437
[school bell ringing]

06:35.994 --> 06:37.829
They workin' yet?

06:39.364 --> 06:41.730
What?
Your psychic powers.

06:41.732 --> 06:44.600
You stare at her every day,
but you never talk to her.

06:44.602 --> 06:48.406
So the only way she's ever gonna know that
you're interested is if she can read your mind.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.536
Hey, I was just texting you.
Meet you in the caf?

07:22.474 --> 07:23.409
Hey.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.577
Oh. Hi.

07:26.579 --> 07:28.046
Jordan, right?

07:28.048 --> 07:30.180
You know my name?

07:30.182 --> 07:33.450
You're in my physics class.
I'm Annie.

07:33.452 --> 07:36.087
Oh.
Nice to meet you.

07:36.089 --> 07:37.889
Officially, that is.

07:37.891 --> 07:40.658
You're trying out for the show?
Huh?

07:40.660 --> 07:43.697
The variety show.
Let me guess, you sing?

07:44.798 --> 07:48.499
Uh, uh... Yeah, sing.

07:48.501 --> 07:50.537
Great. Me too.
There I am.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.641
There you are.
There you are.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.909
Well, I guess I'll see you
at the auditions?

07:57.911 --> 07:59.914
Maybe we can sing together.

08:03.618 --> 08:04.919
Sing.

08:05.453 --> 08:07.989
[school bell ringing]

08:16.131 --> 08:18.964
[Frank] <i>"Jack Quartermaine
knew he was a dead man.</i>

08:18.966 --> 08:21.800
<i>Central Command had inferred as
much when he accepted the mission."</i>

08:21.802 --> 08:23.105
Implied.

08:23.972 --> 08:25.606
[exhales]

08:27.576 --> 08:29.842
Eduardo, you scared
the crap outta me.

08:29.844 --> 08:31.911
Yeah, but you used
the wrong word.

08:31.913 --> 08:34.014
Th-The word
should be "implied."

08:34.015 --> 08:38.120
The speaker implies,
the listener infers.

08:39.222 --> 08:42.956
Yeah. Okay. Thanks.

08:42.957 --> 08:45.725
You know, funny thing
happened to me once. Okay.

08:45.727 --> 08:49.729
I was arguing a case in front
of Judge Hightower, right?

08:49.731 --> 08:54.734
Now every attorney in the district
knows this guy is a class A moron.

08:54.736 --> 08:56.270
Okay, okay.

08:56.272 --> 09:00.007
He used the word "infer"
incorrectly just like you did.

09:00.009 --> 09:02.910
[laughing] Yes, just like...
Okay, listen, Eduardo.

09:02.912 --> 09:04.912
I-I'd love to hear
more about this,

09:04.914 --> 09:08.581
but, you know, uh,
the thing is I'm kinda workin'.

09:08.583 --> 09:09.817
Oh, oh, yeah.
You know?

09:09.819 --> 09:11.819
Don't let me interrupt.
Go ahead.

09:11.821 --> 09:14.058
Okay. Good.
[clears throat]

09:15.758 --> 09:17.061
[sighs]

09:23.033 --> 09:24.667
But you are.

09:25.135 --> 09:27.204
Yeah. Okay.

09:28.272 --> 09:30.138
I thought a man
in your situation

09:30.140 --> 09:33.744
might appreciate a little
constructive criticism.

09:36.680 --> 09:40.016
Wait. "My situation"?
What's that mean?

09:40.018 --> 09:44.186
Well, yeah, Frank, you know, you're not
exactly Book-of-the-Month Club, are you?

09:44.188 --> 09:47.558
No. You're like
Book-of-the-Every-Five-Year Club.

09:48.726 --> 09:51.196
[door closes]
Wow.

09:54.265 --> 09:55.866
[exhales]

10:00.238 --> 10:01.840
"Implied."

10:04.809 --> 10:06.111
Five years.

10:11.182 --> 10:13.585
Here we go, baby. Mission...

10:14.286 --> 10:16.856
[loud polka music playing]

10:19.291 --> 10:20.992
You gotta be kiddin' me!

10:32.705 --> 10:34.707
Hey, would you turn
that down, please?

10:35.975 --> 10:40.047
Eduardo? Turn the music down
please, would ya?

10:41.048 --> 10:42.615
Eduardo.

10:45.017 --> 10:47.787
[grunting]

10:55.195 --> 10:57.262
[music slows down]
Hey, hey, hey!

10:57.264 --> 10:59.364
Watch out!
That's a valuable record!

10:59.366 --> 11:02.133
Do you have
to play it so loud?

11:02.135 --> 11:05.237
I like to listen
for the subtle nuances.

11:05.239 --> 11:07.772
It's polka.
[watch beeping]

11:07.774 --> 11:10.210
Whoa! Here, hold these.
Vinegar time.

11:11.812 --> 11:13.081
What the hell is vinegar time?

11:15.383 --> 11:18.116
Half a cup of vinegar,
twice a day.

11:18.118 --> 11:19.984
Better than any
medication out there.

11:19.986 --> 11:22.421
Want some?
Nah, I'm good, thanks.

11:22.423 --> 11:25.691
Hey, did you see some
leftover Thai food in here?

11:25.693 --> 11:26.926
I was savin' it for lunch.

11:26.928 --> 11:30.262
[gurgling, laughing]

11:30.264 --> 11:32.431
[grunts]

11:32.433 --> 11:34.102
Threw it out.

11:36.771 --> 11:39.372
Got enough chemicals, enough
salt, enough preservatives,

11:39.374 --> 11:41.709
enough MSG
to kill a water buffalo.

11:42.910 --> 11:47.080
Yeah. Um... [clears throat]
Okay, look, Eduardo...

11:47.082 --> 11:49.950
I know this is a difficult situation
for both of us... [gargling]

11:49.952 --> 11:53.086
...but irregardless of that,
I think it would be helpful

11:53.088 --> 11:55.388
if we set some ground rules
right off the bat.

11:55.390 --> 11:56.792
What do you think?

11:59.695 --> 12:00.961
"Regardless."

12:00.963 --> 12:02.129
What?

12:02.131 --> 12:03.364
You meant "regardless."

12:03.366 --> 12:06.133
Or, maybe, "irrespective."

12:06.135 --> 12:08.971
But there's no such word
as "irregardless."

12:12.942 --> 12:14.208
Thanks, Eduardo.

12:14.210 --> 12:16.010
Yo.
Okay, good.

12:16.012 --> 12:17.013
Yeah.

12:47.912 --> 12:49.280
[exhales]

12:50.814 --> 12:53.149
I thought we already
paid the property tax?

12:53.151 --> 12:56.251
Nah, nah.
That one was for last year.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.120
This one is for this year,
which we didn't pay

12:58.122 --> 12:59.988
because we needed the money
for the mortgage.

12:59.990 --> 13:02.858
All right, well,
we'll figure it out.

13:02.860 --> 13:03.962
We always do.

13:05.030 --> 13:07.329
We'd be fine if I could
just finish my novel.

13:07.331 --> 13:09.031
How'd it go today?

13:09.033 --> 13:11.401
Before the polka music
or after?

13:11.403 --> 13:13.770
Dad?
Yeah.

13:13.772 --> 13:16.239
He's either standin' over me
correctin' my spelling,

13:16.241 --> 13:19.275
or thumpin' through the house
criticizin' my dietary habits.

13:19.277 --> 13:21.978
Oh, he's just lonely, honey.
Yes. Yes.

13:21.980 --> 13:24.113
It's been five years
since Mom died,

13:24.115 --> 13:26.015
but I know
he still misses her.

13:26.017 --> 13:28.885
I know, I know, I'm sorry.
I totally get it.

13:28.887 --> 13:31.287
But, babe,
I'm a writer, okay?

13:31.289 --> 13:34.726
And I can't write
if I have to babysit your dad.

13:36.462 --> 13:40.097
Hey. [chuckles] I just got an idea.
Hmm?

13:40.099 --> 13:43.833
Why doesn't he invite some
friends over here tomorrow?

13:43.835 --> 13:45.236
What, seriously?
Yeah.

13:45.238 --> 13:48.038
What, you want me to take care
of a houseful of Eduardos?

13:48.040 --> 13:49.974
No, that's the point.

13:49.976 --> 13:52.377
And they take care
of each other.

13:52.379 --> 13:56.182
They keep each other company,
so you can get back to work.

13:57.283 --> 13:58.485
Hmm.

13:59.085 --> 14:00.820
What do you think?

14:01.388 --> 14:03.355
[jazz music playing]

14:03.357 --> 14:07.091
Read 'em and weep. Straight
to the king. [laughs]

14:07.093 --> 14:10.027
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
[laughs]

14:10.029 --> 14:13.832
Arnold is already
showing a flush.

14:13.834 --> 14:16.067
A straight beats a flush!

14:16.069 --> 14:17.335
You're full of crap!

14:17.337 --> 14:19.870
What are you yelling for?

14:19.872 --> 14:23.008
We're playing for matchsticks,
for crying out loud!

14:23.010 --> 14:26.111
Okay, we got you all set up.
Snacks, beer in the fridge.

14:26.113 --> 14:27.980
Gabe, what difference
does it make?

14:27.982 --> 14:29.614
It makes a difference
in principle.

14:29.616 --> 14:31.550
A straight beats a flush,
right, Arnold?

14:31.552 --> 14:34.487
Only when
it's a straight flush.

14:34.489 --> 14:37.023
That's it. That's it.
He's right.

14:37.025 --> 14:39.859
You guys are cheaters.
You're just a bunch of cheaters.

14:39.861 --> 14:41.893
Hey, hey, hey!
You can't say that.

14:41.895 --> 14:43.962
I'm a certified
public accountant,

14:43.964 --> 14:45.298
and we never cheat!

14:45.300 --> 14:48.100
- Have fun.
- Ah, poker.

14:48.102 --> 14:50.637
I wondered
what I was going to be doing

14:50.639 --> 14:52.408
until I died.

14:53.408 --> 14:55.143
[whispers]
All right, baby.

14:56.210 --> 14:58.179
Yes, sir.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.316
Mm-hmm.

15:06.354 --> 15:08.590
[exhales, inhales]

15:10.526 --> 15:11.892
[exhales sharply]

15:11.894 --> 15:13.427
[typing]

15:13.429 --> 15:15.264
Hey! Where's the john?

15:16.999 --> 15:18.898
Gabe.

15:18.900 --> 15:20.602
- John.
- Okay.

15:21.403 --> 15:22.572
[sighs]

15:23.272 --> 15:25.640
Down the hall,
first door on the left.

15:25.642 --> 15:27.610
Bladder's on its last legs.

15:32.915 --> 15:34.217
All right.

15:37.587 --> 15:40.190
[thumping]
[sighs]

15:41.358 --> 15:44.392
[muttering]
How do you work this thing?

15:44.394 --> 15:47.228
Never mind. That thing's bad
for the environment, anyway.

15:47.230 --> 15:49.063
I brought old Betsy.

15:49.065 --> 15:51.567
So, what's the deal
on that, Eddie?

15:51.569 --> 15:55.002
I thought you didn't
even like your son-in-law.

15:55.004 --> 15:56.940
What're you doing
living in his house?

15:57.407 --> 15:58.642
Uh...

16:00.144 --> 16:02.144
Well, they were having
kind of a rough time

16:02.146 --> 16:05.113
and asked me to move in
and help out a bit.

16:05.115 --> 16:08.317
That's a good thing.
Yes.

16:08.319 --> 16:13.055
Multigenerational families
can be very rewarding.

16:13.057 --> 16:16.593
Wait until the first time you
forget where you put your milk,

16:16.595 --> 16:19.695
and then they find it
in your sock drawer.

16:19.697 --> 16:22.066
Never get a reward
for that one.

16:24.068 --> 16:25.237
Whoa!

16:28.206 --> 16:30.508
[Eduardo] Hey, Frank!
Lights went out!

16:36.148 --> 16:38.448
All right, Arnold.
See you later, perpetrator.

16:38.450 --> 16:40.651
All right, my man. Be good.
Walter.

16:40.653 --> 16:43.052
<i>Ciao.
Ciao bella.</i>

16:43.054 --> 16:44.687
All right, Gabe.
Take it easy.

16:44.689 --> 16:47.658
Wait for me in the car, Dad.
I'll be right there. Yeah.

16:47.660 --> 16:51.262
Oh, Frank. Thank you so much
for watching Dad all day.

16:51.264 --> 16:54.030
Ah, it's no problem. I can
tell that he had a lot of fun.

16:54.032 --> 16:57.635
I was wondering if maybe he could
come back again sometime soon?

16:57.637 --> 17:01.138
Uh... Well, you know, Denise,
this was kind of a one-time thing.

17:01.140 --> 17:03.574
I'm not sure if we're gonna make
it a regular event. I mean...

17:03.576 --> 17:06.743
I could help with the expenses. No,
no, I mean, that's not necessary.

17:06.746 --> 17:08.746
Please. You would be
doing me a huge favor.

17:08.748 --> 17:11.449
Here. At least take 100.
The senior home charges 300.

17:11.451 --> 17:13.384
What, $300 per person?

17:13.386 --> 17:15.021
Per day.

17:18.391 --> 17:20.458
You don't say?

17:20.460 --> 17:23.494
No, no. I mean, we could fit a dozen
or so people in the house at once.

17:23.497 --> 17:25.497
I mean, if we charge
100 bucks a day...

17:25.499 --> 17:28.400
Okay, well, you wanna bring
12 people into our living room?

17:28.402 --> 17:31.603
No, no, no.
Not people, Emma. Clients.

17:31.605 --> 17:33.538
[scoffs] I don't know, Frank.

17:33.540 --> 17:36.208
It's a lot of work taking
care of senior citizens.

17:36.210 --> 17:38.744
You're the one that said that they
could take care of each other.

17:38.746 --> 17:40.480
What do I know
about senior citizens?

17:40.482 --> 17:42.380
I'm a high school teacher.
Oh.

17:42.382 --> 17:44.817
Hey, Dad.
Can I talk to you for a sec?

17:44.819 --> 17:47.520
Not right now, Jordie. Your mom
and I are discussin' something.

17:47.522 --> 17:48.788
It sounds like you're arguing.

17:48.790 --> 17:50.325
Don't you have homework?

17:51.326 --> 17:52.727
Thanks, Dad.

17:53.795 --> 17:56.596
[sighs] The truth is,
we need the money.

17:56.598 --> 17:58.331
Let's just try it for one week.
What do you say?

17:58.333 --> 17:59.634
[sighs]

18:03.104 --> 18:05.671
Hello? Hi, Denise.

18:05.673 --> 18:08.374
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's Frank Collins.
We met the other day?

18:08.376 --> 18:10.811
Yes, exactly.
How are you? Good, good.

18:10.813 --> 18:14.015
Listen, Denise, how would you
like a place to put your dad?

18:14.850 --> 18:16.352
I sure did.

18:33.202 --> 18:35.304
[chuckles]

18:40.477 --> 18:41.744
Here.

18:47.149 --> 18:48.449
Dad?
Yeah.

18:48.451 --> 18:50.351
I really need to talk
to you about something.

18:50.353 --> 18:52.520
Can it wait, Jordan? I'm
a little busy right now.

18:52.522 --> 18:54.223
Excuse me.
[sighs]

18:56.860 --> 18:59.460
Had breakfast yet?
I'll get something at school.

18:59.462 --> 19:03.499
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Your body is a machine.

19:03.501 --> 19:06.166
You gotta keep it fueled up.
Here.

19:06.168 --> 19:07.835
Homemade granola.

19:07.837 --> 19:13.176
I always keep a couple handfuls
in my pocket, just in case.

19:20.885 --> 19:22.620
Thanks, Grandpa.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.460
Hey. What're you doin'?

19:31.462 --> 19:34.263
Well, it was so nice havin'
your friends over the other day,

19:34.265 --> 19:35.600
I thought maybe
we'd invite some more.

19:36.735 --> 19:38.200
I don't have
any more friends.

19:38.202 --> 19:39.502
[doorbell rings]

19:39.504 --> 19:41.172
Not yet.

19:45.276 --> 19:48.278
Hello, everybody! Welcome. Come on in.
Good to see ya.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.547
Thank you very much.
Cash or check is appreciated.

19:50.549 --> 19:52.449
Of course, we prefer cash,
but we're not picky.

19:52.451 --> 19:55.385
Hello. Nice to meet you.
Hey, how are ya?

19:55.387 --> 19:58.355
Good to see you, good to... Thank
you, thank you. Thank you very much.

19:58.357 --> 20:01.224
Go right on in. Plenty of seating.
Lots of snacks.

20:01.226 --> 20:03.259
That's great.
Thank you, thank you.

20:03.261 --> 20:05.261
Hey, Gabe!
How are you, man?

20:05.263 --> 20:06.365
Bye, Pops.

20:10.435 --> 20:12.670
Gabe, what the hell
are you doin' here?

20:12.672 --> 20:15.208
I don't know, but Denise said
I had to show up.

20:15.875 --> 20:19.244
[Frank] Okay. All right.
I'll see you later. Bye.

20:28.522 --> 20:31.722
All righty.
Okay, you guys.

20:31.724 --> 20:33.290
I'm Frank.

20:33.292 --> 20:35.292
[sighs]

20:35.294 --> 20:37.361
Hi, everybody.
Nice to see you guys.

20:37.363 --> 20:38.964
How about goin' around
the room, you know,

20:38.966 --> 20:40.632
gettin' to know each other
a little bit.

20:40.634 --> 20:42.502
Tell us a little somethin'
about yourselves.

20:43.603 --> 20:49.241
Uh... Sure, I'm Lou.
They call me Big Lou.

20:49.243 --> 20:54.680
Uh... 75. I fought in 'Nam,
got a Purple Heart.

20:54.682 --> 20:57.416
Again with the Purple Heart.

20:57.418 --> 20:58.951
He fell off
the back of a jeep.

20:58.953 --> 21:00.254
Still counts.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.494
And I'm Bonnie.
I'm his wife.

21:09.496 --> 21:10.932
Yeah, like
they couldn't tell.

21:11.966 --> 21:15.301
Oh, I-I guess I don't
need to introduce myself.

21:15.303 --> 21:16.536
Mm.

21:16.538 --> 21:18.572
[chuckles]

21:20.642 --> 21:22.644
Oh! I'm Dan North.

21:25.781 --> 21:29.951
Dynamite Dan, the Van Man?
See? Yeah? Mmm?

21:32.487 --> 21:35.591
Our prices are explosive.
[mimics explosion]

21:36.559 --> 21:38.459
Oh, yeah!
I remember those commercials.

21:38.461 --> 21:40.027
You used to blow stuff up.

21:40.029 --> 21:42.562
Ah! Yeah, yeah.

21:42.564 --> 21:44.031
What'd you say?

21:44.033 --> 21:47.670
I said you used to blow stuff up
in the commercials.

21:48.337 --> 21:50.504
I'm sorry.
I don't hear very well anymore.

21:50.506 --> 21:52.676
[louder] I used to blow stuff up
in my commercials.

21:53.843 --> 21:54.877
[clears throat]

21:57.346 --> 22:02.318
Oh. I remember that place.
Isn't it a yogurt shop now?

22:02.919 --> 22:04.486
Huh?

22:04.488 --> 22:06.353
Oh, oh, I can't do yogurt.

22:06.355 --> 22:08.022
It gives me the whoopsies.

22:08.024 --> 22:09.556
What the hell are
the whoopsies?

22:09.558 --> 22:13.828
My name is Millie,
and these are my grandchildren.

22:13.830 --> 22:15.965
Do you wanna see them?

22:15.967 --> 22:18.902
This one is Alicia.
Isn't she cute?

22:19.669 --> 22:22.003
And this is...
Oh, this is Owen.

22:22.005 --> 22:24.907
And this is Candice,
and this...

22:24.909 --> 22:27.510
Oh, this is Timothy,

22:27.512 --> 22:30.912
and his twin sister is Tammy.
I'll show you her.

22:30.914 --> 22:34.415
I'll tell you what. I'm gonna let you
guys get acquainted with each other.

22:34.417 --> 22:36.752
I'm gonna leave you guys here.
How about some TV, maybe?

22:36.754 --> 22:38.521
[Gabe]
Hey! It's almost 11:00.

22:38.523 --> 22:40.655
We can watch
<i>Guess My Price Tag!</i>

22:40.657 --> 22:41.924
[Walter] All right, all right.
Oh, yes.

22:41.926 --> 22:43.293
<i>Guess My Price Tag!</i>

22:44.427 --> 22:46.796
All right.
That's comin' on.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.498
You guys, again, please
help yourselves with snacks.

22:49.500 --> 22:53.538
And if there's anything
that you need, um, ask Eduardo.

22:55.907 --> 22:58.041
Sorry. What'd he say?

22:58.043 --> 22:59.943
[school bell ringing]
[Kenny] So, you tell her yet?

22:59.945 --> 23:01.578
[Jordan sighs]
Are you kidding?

23:01.580 --> 23:04.080
If I tell Annie the only reason
I signed up for the audition

23:04.082 --> 23:06.116
was because I wanted to
talk to her, she's gonna...

23:06.118 --> 23:09.385
She's gonna think you're even more
of a creep than you already are?

23:09.387 --> 23:10.754
Thanks.

23:10.756 --> 23:12.756
Hey, Jordan.

23:12.758 --> 23:14.791
Have you picked
out your song yet?

23:14.793 --> 23:17.027
Uh, my song?
Yeah.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.496
You know,
for your audition?

23:19.498 --> 23:21.932
I'm doing "My Heart Will
Go On." I love Céline.

23:21.934 --> 23:26.403
Yeah.
She can really... sing.

23:26.405 --> 23:29.072
[chuckles]
Well, better pick one soon.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.943
Audition's in two weeks.

23:32.779 --> 23:36.414
"Yeah.
She can really, uh, sing."

23:36.416 --> 23:37.951
Shut up!

23:40.619 --> 23:44.422
[loudly] No! See?
Now you've turned it off!

23:44.424 --> 23:47.159
The input button! You were
supposed to push the input button!

23:47.161 --> 23:49.560
What're you talkin' about?
I got one of these at home.

23:49.562 --> 23:52.597
What are we supposed to do with these
games? They're all missing pieces.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.800
Ah, forget about that. Will you rub my leg?
It's actin' up.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.568
Rub your own leg.

23:57.570 --> 24:01.974
Here. My son gave me these
when my lumbago acts up.

24:01.976 --> 24:04.844
Mm. Thank you.
Let's see.

24:07.114 --> 24:08.780
Oh, that's good.

24:08.782 --> 24:11.717
Mm-hmm.
The pain goes right away.

24:11.719 --> 24:14.087
You wanna try one?
Oh. Thanks.

24:14.089 --> 24:15.989
I get some pain too.
Can I have one?

24:15.991 --> 24:17.625
Be my guest.

24:19.059 --> 24:20.859
[loudly] Hey!
What?

24:20.861 --> 24:22.728
You want one?
Sure!

24:22.730 --> 24:24.030
Thank you.

24:24.032 --> 24:27.600
These are actually
pretty good.

24:27.602 --> 24:29.137
What's in these things?

24:43.652 --> 24:45.818
What if we're all just...

24:45.820 --> 24:50.925
tiny, little microbes
on this gigantic organism?

24:50.927 --> 24:53.893
And what if that organism...

24:53.895 --> 24:57.499
is a microbe
on another organism?

24:58.134 --> 24:59.769
Ooh.

25:01.137 --> 25:03.037
[groans]

25:03.039 --> 25:06.675
[laughing]

25:07.843 --> 25:12.180
Hey, I'm Mister Ed.
I'm a knight.

25:12.182 --> 25:17.453
[laughing]

25:30.033 --> 25:32.235
Those are damn good candies.

25:34.738 --> 25:36.673
[laughs]

25:46.950 --> 25:49.687
[Frank] <i>"Jack Quartermaine
had come to a dead end."</i>

25:50.254 --> 25:52.457
[exhales]
Again, Frank?

25:54.591 --> 25:57.793
You know, I came to this same dead
end in T <i>he Peruvian Principle.</i>

25:57.795 --> 26:01.298
Then again in <i>The Romanian</i>
<i>Rituals</i> and <i>The Warsaw Wire.</i>

26:01.300 --> 26:03.599
Which, by the way, was not
one of your better titles.

26:03.601 --> 26:06.335
- So?
- So...

26:06.337 --> 26:09.638
maybe that's why you're having such
a hard time finishing this book.

26:09.640 --> 26:13.343
Maybe I'm not the only one
stuck in a dead end.

26:13.345 --> 26:15.679
[beeping]

26:15.681 --> 26:17.813
[smoke alarm beeping]

26:17.815 --> 26:19.251
Oh, no.

26:23.188 --> 26:25.057
[sniffs] What the...?

26:33.932 --> 26:36.336
[shouting, grunting]

26:40.206 --> 26:41.772
[groans]

26:41.774 --> 26:45.178
Come on, Frank. Stop messin' around!
We got fire here.

26:46.146 --> 26:48.647
[straining] Okay. Thank you.
[alarm voice] <i>Fire! Fire!</i>

26:49.049 --> 26:52.317
[sighs]
Help. Help.

26:52.319 --> 26:54.952
Hey, could you call
the fire department

26:54.954 --> 26:57.922
and ask them to send us some firemen?
[giggles]

26:57.924 --> 27:00.958
I knew we should have
had an escape plan.

27:00.960 --> 27:03.896
[Eduardo shouts]
Frank! Frank, come on! Hey!

27:03.898 --> 27:05.363
Where's the fire extinguisher?

27:05.365 --> 27:07.965
- It's all... Just calm down.
- Duck and dive.

27:07.967 --> 27:09.967
Duck and... Duck and dive!

27:09.969 --> 27:12.637
Everybody just calm down.
[Dan] Headed for the front door!

27:12.639 --> 27:14.873
Gabe! What are you doin'?
What?

27:14.875 --> 27:16.343
We got the munchies.
You got the munchies?

27:17.177 --> 27:19.244
[coughing]

27:19.246 --> 27:20.379
[alarm voice] <i>Fire!</i>

27:20.381 --> 27:21.947
Ah! Ah!

27:21.949 --> 27:23.949
Comin' through. Let me through.

27:23.951 --> 27:25.851
Let me through.
Let me through.

27:25.853 --> 27:26.787
No, no, no!

27:28.989 --> 27:30.823
I've always wanted to do that.

27:30.825 --> 27:32.193
Eduardo!

27:33.894 --> 27:35.863
[alarm voice] <i>Fire! Fire!</i>

27:37.165 --> 27:40.833
Oh! Can we make that stop?
[alarm beeping]

27:40.835 --> 27:42.201
Just take the battery out.

27:42.203 --> 27:44.903
You have to push
the reset button.

27:44.905 --> 27:46.738
I can't reach that thing.

27:46.740 --> 27:48.408
Typical.

27:48.410 --> 27:53.146
I got it. I got it. Don't worry.
Here we go. Put this here...

27:53.148 --> 27:54.950
I got it.

27:56.451 --> 27:58.051
- Whoa.
- You gotta take the battery out!

27:58.053 --> 28:00.287
Push the reset button!

28:00.289 --> 28:03.790
Here. Here. Whack it with this.
It always worked for me.

28:03.792 --> 28:04.891
Yeah?
Yeah.

28:04.893 --> 28:06.862
Yeah? Okay.

28:09.131 --> 28:11.731
- Whack it!
- Take the battery out, Frank!

28:11.733 --> 28:14.468
- Whack it!
- Push the reset button!

28:14.470 --> 28:17.304
- Whack it!
- Which button is the reset button?

28:17.306 --> 28:19.406
Well, I don't know.
It's your house!

28:19.408 --> 28:21.308
Whack it, whack it, whack it!

28:21.310 --> 28:23.477
[all shouting, screaming]

28:23.479 --> 28:25.347
[alarm voice] <i>Fire! Fire!</i>

28:25.349 --> 28:27.384
Oh. Oh.

28:28.118 --> 28:29.483
[beeping stops]

28:29.485 --> 28:32.052
Well, what do you know?
A reset button.

28:32.054 --> 28:34.054
[phone rings]
Is it off?

28:34.056 --> 28:36.191
[Frank groans]
Yeah.

28:36.193 --> 28:37.427
Son?

28:38.795 --> 28:41.195
Can you feel your feet?
Yeah, I felt that.

28:41.197 --> 28:42.732
Hold on.

28:44.501 --> 28:46.770
Frank, here, it's for you.

28:47.304 --> 28:50.373
[clears throat] Hello?

28:50.375 --> 28:54.509
Oh, yeah. Everything's fine.
Okay, yeah. Bye-bye.

28:54.511 --> 28:56.880
[groans] Okay.

28:57.381 --> 28:59.382
I'm all right.

28:59.384 --> 29:01.852
Whoo! The alarm company
wanted to know...

29:02.887 --> 29:04.321
[alarm voice, distorted]
<i>Fire! Fire!</i>

29:08.393 --> 29:10.395
Got anymore popcorn?

29:11.029 --> 29:12.397
[Emma] You sure you're okay?

29:13.264 --> 29:15.097
Yeah, it was just
a little bump on the head.

29:15.099 --> 29:16.831
And a fall down the stairs.

29:16.833 --> 29:19.168
And I was almost
suffocated by chemical foam.

29:19.170 --> 29:22.538
But judgin' by the numbers,
it was all worth it.

29:22.540 --> 29:25.275
You're lucky that's all
that happened to you.

29:25.277 --> 29:27.244
Eduardo,
thank you for caring.

29:27.246 --> 29:29.045
I'm not talkin' about you,
you idiot.

29:29.047 --> 29:32.048
I'm talkin' about that whole
houseful of people you had.

29:32.050 --> 29:33.950
This whole place
could've gone up.

29:33.952 --> 29:35.918
Hold on, now. Aren't you
exaggerating a little bit?

29:35.920 --> 29:37.955
Try this on for size.

29:37.957 --> 29:43.092
You're operating an illegal social
service facility out of your house.

29:43.094 --> 29:44.463
That's not an exaggeration.

29:45.397 --> 29:49.132
Honey, maybe this isn't
such a good idea after all.

29:49.134 --> 29:51.868
Well, how about this money?
Hmm?

29:51.870 --> 29:54.004
That's a pretty good idea,
wouldn't you say?

29:54.006 --> 29:56.406
Until I finish my book, it's the
only thing standin' between us

29:56.408 --> 29:58.141
and gettin' kicked
out of our house.

29:58.143 --> 29:59.812
Or, you get a real job.

30:02.015 --> 30:03.348
Dad.

30:03.350 --> 30:05.215
No, no. No, honey.

30:05.217 --> 30:07.552
I like hearin' what
he really thinks about me.

30:07.554 --> 30:10.154
He never thought I was good
enough for his daughter, anyway.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.257
[scoffs] That's not true, Frank.
Really?

30:12.259 --> 30:14.259
Ask him.

30:14.261 --> 30:15.829
Dad?

30:17.264 --> 30:19.232
I stand on the Fifth.

30:22.402 --> 30:24.104
Let me tell you somethin',
Frank.

30:25.005 --> 30:28.906
A long time ago,
I made a mistake.

30:28.908 --> 30:30.977
Cost me a lot of years.

30:31.612 --> 30:34.946
I missed watchin'
my daughter grow up.

30:34.948 --> 30:38.851
And I promised myself
when I got out of the joint,

30:38.853 --> 30:41.453
I would keep my nose clean.

30:41.455 --> 30:46.127
Now, this is your house,
so you can do whatever you want,

30:47.094 --> 30:48.896
but you count me out.

31:02.944 --> 31:04.245
[Frank] What if he's right?

31:05.379 --> 31:07.547
Of course he's not right.

31:07.549 --> 31:09.949
Writing is a real job.

31:09.951 --> 31:13.053
Just because you haven't
sold a book in five years

31:13.055 --> 31:15.556
and you're not making
any money at the moment...

31:15.558 --> 31:18.058
and you've got a deadline you're
probably not gonna meet...

31:18.060 --> 31:20.527
you feel like a failure,
I mean, it doesn't mean that...

31:20.529 --> 31:23.566
Yeah, actually, I wasn't
talkin' about the writing.

31:24.634 --> 31:26.600
Oh.

31:26.602 --> 31:29.069
- [door slams]
- [Eduardo breathes heavily]

31:29.071 --> 31:31.441
Eduardo?
Are you all right?

31:32.308 --> 31:34.642
Who the hell are you?

31:34.644 --> 31:36.012
Dad?

31:36.679 --> 31:38.312
What are you doin' in my house?

31:38.314 --> 31:41.217
No, no, no, Eduardo,
you're in our house. Hey.

31:42.918 --> 31:46.153
- Where am I?
- Shh, you're just havin' a bad dream, Dad.

31:46.155 --> 31:47.388
It's all right.

31:47.390 --> 31:49.458
What are you doin'...
Where are you takin' me?

31:49.460 --> 31:50.327
What...?

31:51.562 --> 31:53.296
Esmeralda!

31:54.397 --> 31:56.966
[Emma] Just
a little more water, Dad.

32:00.437 --> 32:02.072
Good.

32:05.108 --> 32:06.675
[Jordan]
Is Grandpa gonna be okay?

32:06.677 --> 32:08.510
[Emma] Yes. Yeah.

32:08.512 --> 32:11.079
He's just a little bit
confused, that's it.

32:11.081 --> 32:12.349
He's gonna be fine.

32:19.123 --> 32:21.392
All right.
Go back to bed, Jordie.

32:28.198 --> 32:29.634
[Frank sighs]

32:37.409 --> 32:38.977
[sighs]

32:39.378 --> 32:41.146
It's okay, Eduardo.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.381
It's okay.

32:54.259 --> 32:58.127
[Frank] All right.
Millie, two pills once daily.

32:58.129 --> 33:01.331
Thank you very much. Hey, Dan.
And what've we got here?

33:01.333 --> 33:04.535
Uh, one twice a day. All right, thank you.
Yeah, one twice a day.

33:04.537 --> 33:06.437
Thank you. Hey!

33:06.439 --> 33:09.306
Big Lou. We have once
every three hours. Got it.

33:09.308 --> 33:11.776
Do me a favor and double his dose?
It keeps him calm.

33:11.778 --> 33:14.312
Copy that. With you as my
wife, we should triple it.

33:14.314 --> 33:19.216
- [woman] Come on, Mom, let's go.
- I'm moving as fast as I can.

33:19.218 --> 33:21.619
Hi. I'm Beverly.
This is my mother, Blanche.

33:21.621 --> 33:23.120
Hi, Blanche.
Hello.

33:23.122 --> 33:25.559
Actually,
we don't take drop-ins, but...

33:28.394 --> 33:31.228
But we will definitely
make an exception. [laughs]

33:31.230 --> 33:34.098
I need someplace to put her during the
day until my father's probate closes.

33:34.100 --> 33:35.633
Everywhere else in town
has a waiting list.

33:35.635 --> 33:37.636
Bev, I'm fine
living by myself.

33:37.638 --> 33:40.538
Don't argue, Mom!
I'm already late for a meeting.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.173
- Could she stay?
- Uh...

33:42.175 --> 33:44.409
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to impose.

33:44.411 --> 33:47.111
Well, it... No imposition at all.
We'd love to have you.

33:47.113 --> 33:48.514
Great.
Thank you.

33:48.516 --> 33:49.648
I'll pick her up at five.
Good.

33:49.650 --> 33:51.517
Thank you.
All right.

33:51.519 --> 33:53.320
Blanche.
Yes?

33:54.154 --> 33:56.355
You play horseshoes, girl?
Let's see.

33:56.357 --> 33:57.991
Okay.
[Frank chuckles]

34:02.598 --> 34:04.064
Hmm.

34:10.571 --> 34:14.074
[radio beeps] Ned Tooley to headquarters.
We have a situation.

34:25.152 --> 34:26.255
[chuckles]

34:28.289 --> 34:32.194
[polka playing]

34:34.161 --> 34:36.630
You stepped over the line. That's cheating!
What are you talkin' about?

34:36.632 --> 34:37.764
What? I can't hear you.

34:37.766 --> 34:40.199
Just a little more
on your nose.

34:40.202 --> 34:42.435
You know how sensitive
you are to the sun.

34:42.437 --> 34:44.871
I look like
a damn French mime.

34:44.873 --> 34:47.675
And this is my
great-grandson, Duncan.

34:47.677 --> 34:50.110
He's a professional
waffle maker,

34:50.112 --> 34:54.147
and he works at one of the best
Waffle Houses in Pittsburgh.

34:54.149 --> 34:56.216
And you...
Would you excuse me?

34:56.217 --> 34:57.820
Oh, sure, sure.

35:02.893 --> 35:05.495
[polka continues]

35:06.896 --> 35:08.298
Oh!

35:09.165 --> 35:11.401
- Excuse me.
- Hi, can I help you?

35:12.369 --> 35:14.171
I was just looking
for the ladies room.

35:14.638 --> 35:16.838
Down the hall to the left.

35:16.840 --> 35:20.611
Ah. Thank you.
Nice music.

35:21.345 --> 35:22.413
You like polka?

35:23.213 --> 35:25.149
[chuckles]
Doesn't everybody?

35:25.784 --> 35:27.184
Thank you.

35:33.757 --> 35:36.861
Hey, Eduardo! Come over here and
help me beat this cheatin' rat!

35:38.195 --> 35:39.163
Okay, now, what'd you say?

35:42.700 --> 35:44.435
You're not playin'?

35:45.570 --> 35:47.337
I never learned.

35:47.339 --> 35:49.341
[chuckles] It's an easy game.
I'll teach you, if you like.

35:51.509 --> 35:54.377
Over here, just, like,
swing back like this.

35:54.379 --> 35:55.645
Your arm back.
Look here.

35:55.647 --> 35:56.913
Sure. Here,
let me show you.

35:56.915 --> 35:58.849
Okay. Here we go. Swing it back.

35:58.851 --> 36:01.284
There you go. All the way back.
That's it.

36:01.286 --> 36:02.686
Wow, Blanche,
you're really graceful.

36:02.688 --> 36:03.723
[Blanche] Huh?

36:04.723 --> 36:07.624
I was a dancer.
On Broadway.

36:07.626 --> 36:08.892
Really?
Mm.

36:08.894 --> 36:11.564
Understudy
in <i>West Side Story.</i>

36:12.465 --> 36:15.232
Yeah, never made
it onstage, though.

36:15.234 --> 36:18.203
Damn Chita Rivera.
She never missed a show.

36:22.608 --> 36:26.911
Uh? Okay, you know what? Uh, just swing
it one, two, three, and let it go.

36:26.913 --> 36:27.913
Oh. Okay.

36:30.916 --> 36:35.285
I'm only askin' for an extension
on the deadline, Harry. No.

36:35.287 --> 36:37.355
Man, it's not like
I'm sittin' around

36:37.357 --> 36:39.426
waitin' for inspiration
to hit me on the head.

36:46.266 --> 36:48.168
Let me call you back.
[doorbell rings]

36:48.970 --> 36:50.437
[Frank sighs]

36:51.005 --> 36:53.738
Hey, can I help you?
Hi! Ned Tooley.

36:53.740 --> 36:55.340
Department of Social Services.

36:55.342 --> 36:57.977
I have a few questions about your business.
May I come in?

36:57.979 --> 37:00.913
Uh... Sure, come on in.
No!

37:00.915 --> 37:03.015
Eduardo, what's the matter?
Shut up, Frank.

37:03.017 --> 37:04.616
[Frank] Okay.

37:04.618 --> 37:06.818
Do you have a warrant
to enter the premises?

37:06.820 --> 37:09.287
No. This is just
a friendly visit.

37:09.289 --> 37:12.192
Okay. Let's be friends
on the porch, okay?

37:12.760 --> 37:13.961
Close the door, Frank.

37:18.866 --> 37:20.700
How can
we help you, sir?

37:20.702 --> 37:22.635
Oh, yes, I have
a couple questions.

37:22.637 --> 37:26.405
How long have you been operating
an elder day care facility?

37:26.407 --> 37:28.908
Oh, I'd say...
Don't answer that, Frank.

37:28.910 --> 37:30.643
I'm sorry.
Are you Mr. Collins' attorney?

37:30.645 --> 37:32.411
No, no, I'm Mr. Collins'
father-in-law.

37:32.413 --> 37:33.512
All right, then.

37:33.514 --> 37:37.350
Do you have a license
to operate a day care facility?

37:37.352 --> 37:38.685
You know, technically I...
Don't answer that, Frank.

37:38.687 --> 37:40.586
Oh, fine.

37:40.588 --> 37:42.889
I can see we're not gonna
get anywhere here today.

37:42.891 --> 37:45.459
But I will tell you this,
Mr. Collins.

37:45.461 --> 37:48.495
If you don't have a license
to operate a day care facility,

37:48.497 --> 37:51.832
I, with the powers invested in me by
the city Social Services Department,

37:51.834 --> 37:54.770
will be forced
to shut you down.

37:56.672 --> 37:57.841
I shall return.

37:58.975 --> 38:00.476
Have a nice day.

38:06.015 --> 38:08.515
Thanks.
That was very impressive.

38:08.517 --> 38:10.918
First year law student
could've handled that.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.855
I told you. You're gonna need
a license for this place.

38:13.857 --> 38:16.624
So, what do I do now?

38:16.626 --> 38:20.394
I know that kind of guy.
He'll be back tomorrow.

38:20.396 --> 38:23.000
And city hall closes at 5:00.

38:24.668 --> 38:26.668
Well, we better
get down there.

38:26.670 --> 38:29.737
What are you gonna do with
all the people in your backyard?

38:29.739 --> 38:31.374
[sighs]

38:35.880 --> 38:37.746
Ah.
[clears throat]

38:37.748 --> 38:40.949
Frank, can ya pull in somewhere?
I gotta go to the bathroom.

38:40.951 --> 38:43.519
Didn't I tell ya to go
before we got in the car?

38:43.521 --> 38:46.021
I did.
I have to go again.

38:46.023 --> 38:48.024
Well, now you'll just have
to wait till we get there.

38:48.026 --> 38:50.727
Suit yourself.
It's not my van.

38:50.729 --> 38:53.996
And that's my son's
second wife. Or third.

38:53.998 --> 38:58.701
Oh, well, they all kind of
blend together after a while.

38:58.703 --> 39:00.136
[laughing]

39:00.138 --> 39:02.507
My kids wanna put me
in a nursing home.

39:03.142 --> 39:06.109
Why didn't you tell them
you don't wanna go?

39:06.111 --> 39:07.576
Yeah, I did.

39:07.578 --> 39:09.946
And they're trying
to get a court order

in one anyway.

All right, well,
just leave it alone.

39:25.131 --> 39:28.631
- Stay calm.
- Ooh, I'm allergic to bees.

39:28.633 --> 39:29.933
No!
How allergic?

39:29.935 --> 39:32.903
If I get stung,
I might not die.

39:32.905 --> 39:35.072
Hey, listen.
Don't make it angry, okay?

39:35.074 --> 39:37.175
Bees get nasty
when they're angry.

39:37.177 --> 39:39.044
Just let it go
out the window.

- You're doing that on purpose.

39:42.615 --> 39:44.748
- Whack it! Whack it!
- I think it's already angry.

It wants my cologne.

Pull over!

I didn't get stung after all.

41:49.547 --> 41:50.813

41:50.815 --> 41:53.483
Oh, certainly.
Let me just check.

41:54.151 --> 41:58.687

41:58.689 --> 42:00.122
Eighteen months?

42:00.124 --> 42:02.125
Yes. Sometimes
it's closer to 12,

42:02.127 --> 42:04.193
and other times
it's closer to 18.

42:04.195 --> 42:05.894
That's why
we give you a range.

42:05.896 --> 42:07.730
No, I need this license today!

42:07.732 --> 42:09.767
Oh, well.

42:10.735 --> 42:14.904
Then you probably should have
applied 18 months ago. Or 12.

Next.

Yeah, the special's good.

42:33.091 --> 42:34.991
I'll have the special.

[all loudly] The special!

42:45.171 --> 42:46.904
What's the special?

42:46.906 --> 42:49.707
Nine-ounce filet mignon
in a peppercorn sauce,

42:49.709 --> 42:52.776
almond rice pilaf,
and a side of corn on the cob.

42:52.778 --> 42:57.717
I'm lactose intolerant. Can you
substitute chicken for the steak?

42:59.252 --> 43:01.018
Sure.

43:01.020 --> 43:03.686
May I have the
corn off the cob?

43:03.688 --> 43:06.223
No cob.
I'll just have the special.

43:06.225 --> 43:11.096
But make it French fries instead
of that rice stuff, you know?

but no almonds. I can't.

I don't need anything.

Unless we go after
an existing license.

a similar company in the past,

but dormant.

in front of him,

one little piece of evidence,

45:09.453 --> 45:15.391

no better than circumstantial,

45:15.393 --> 45:17.759

49:58.252 --> 50:00.419
We don't have $50,000.

50:00.421 --> 50:02.387
We're just tryin' to run
an elder care facility.

50:02.389 --> 50:05.089
You know, give seniors
a fun and safe place to go.

50:05.091 --> 50:08.293
Wow. That's really,
really touching.

50:08.295 --> 50:11.363
I respect that, I really do.

50:11.365 --> 50:15.467
How about ten grand
and we call it a deal?

50:15.469 --> 50:18.070
I can give you $2,000.

50:18.072 --> 50:20.640
Oh, my God, yes! Whoo!

50:20.642 --> 50:23.610
Um... I mean, yes.

50:23.612 --> 50:27.112
I reluctantly accept and
confirm this binding contract.

50:27.114 --> 50:29.081
Can you give me cash?

50:29.083 --> 50:30.283
[Ned] Daddy Day Care?

50:30.285 --> 50:31.751
[Frank]
Actually, we're re-branding.

50:31.753 --> 50:35.255
We're now called...
Granddaddy Day Care.

50:35.257 --> 50:38.359
[laughs] Clever.
Mind if I take a look around?

50:38.361 --> 50:40.660
Not without a warrant.

50:40.662 --> 50:43.797
You need to show just cause
to enter a private residence.

50:43.799 --> 50:46.667
You're a real stickler for
detail, aren't you? [chuckles]

50:46.669 --> 50:48.135
Look, guys, I'm just
trying to do my job.

50:48.137 --> 50:51.774
I wanna make sure you're running a
safe facility so that nobody gets hurt.

50:52.642 --> 50:55.244
Well, all the more reason
for you to bring that warrant.

50:56.646 --> 50:59.282
Fine. I'll be back.

51:00.416 --> 51:01.818
And I'm bringing friends.

51:10.359 --> 51:11.662
Hey, Eduardo.

51:12.596 --> 51:14.362
I know you and I haven't
always seen eye-to-eye.

51:14.364 --> 51:16.397
Yeah, really?

51:16.399 --> 51:18.700
I just wanted to say thank
you for buyin' the license.

51:18.702 --> 51:22.170
I'll pay you the
$2,000 back, eventually.

51:22.172 --> 51:24.639
Hey, forget about that,
all right?

51:24.641 --> 51:27.509
After you and Emma
invited me to live here,

51:27.511 --> 51:29.544
it's the least I can do.

51:29.546 --> 51:33.417
Yeah. Hey, you know,
I was also wondering if...

51:34.451 --> 51:36.752
You want me to
make an appointment for you?

51:36.754 --> 51:38.823
You know, to see the doctor?

51:40.157 --> 51:41.793
Doctor? What for?

51:42.526 --> 51:44.328
For the episodes.

51:45.563 --> 51:47.799
What the hell are you
talkin' about, Frank?

51:48.666 --> 51:53.268
You know, when you get
confused and disoriented?

51:53.270 --> 51:54.639
It might be somethin' serious.

51:55.807 --> 51:59.743
Look,
just because I helped you out,

51:59.745 --> 52:02.278
doesn't mean you can
start buttin' in my life.

52:02.280 --> 52:04.213
No, I didn't mean to.
Let's get one thing straight.

52:04.215 --> 52:06.215
I don't need to see a doctor.

52:06.217 --> 52:07.550
There's nothin' wrong with me.

52:07.552 --> 52:09.452
Why don't you take care
of your business here,

52:09.454 --> 52:10.589

What about your book?

I gotta concentrate
on Granddaddy Day Care.

this was to give you a chance to write?

I got it all figured out.

In two weeks,
we'll pay the back taxes,

56:39.767 --> 56:41.467
we'll get current
on the mortgage,

have that on file.

What we don't have on file is a record of
inspection for the license holder since 2003.

if your facility's up to code.

Social Services and, frankly,

is closed until further notice.

Don't blame my dad because you
haven't finished your book!

01:00:15.224 --> 01:00:16.956
Why not?
It's his fault!

01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:19.061
It is not his fault, Frank.
It's yours!

I am your wife
and your biggest fan,

01:00:24.733 --> 01:00:27.868

a word in five years.

to do with my father.

Now we have a tax bill
we can't pay,

and we owe $50,000 to the city!

01:00:35.411 --> 01:00:38.012
Yeah, maybe your dad would
like to pay for that, huh?

01:00:38.014 --> 01:00:39.880
I thought he was
some big rich lawyer,

01:00:39.882 --> 01:00:42.316
and he's over here spongin' off of
us, livin' in our house rent free.

01:00:42.318 --> 01:00:44.385
Why can't he cough
up the money, huh?

01:00:44.387 --> 01:00:46.022

the truth a long time ago.

savings or investments?

01:01:22.226 --> 01:01:25.428
Had both. Plenty of 'em.
Lost 'em all.

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:29.033
How? I met a Nigerian
princess on the Internet,

01:01:30.201 --> 01:01:33.436
and she was tryin' to get her
family out of the country and...

01:01:33.438 --> 01:01:38.441
said she had millions and needed
a bank account in America.

01:01:38.443 --> 01:01:40.276
You fell for an Internet scam.

01:01:40.278 --> 01:01:45.951
See, she was so convincing
and... I was so lonely.

01:01:47.085 --> 01:01:49.453
I guess after
your mother died,

01:01:49.455 --> 01:01:52.057
I just kinda lost my way a bit.

01:01:53.058 --> 01:01:54.558
Did you call the police?

01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:58.362
How would it look?
An ex-con gets conned.

01:01:58.364 --> 01:02:00.164
I was too embarrassed.

01:02:00.166 --> 01:02:02.432
Yeah, but you paid
for the license.

01:02:02.434 --> 01:02:05.068
That $2,000, where'd
you get that money from?

01:02:05.070 --> 01:02:07.073
My social security check.

01:02:08.374 --> 01:02:11.408
You gave up your social
security check to help me?

01:02:11.410 --> 01:02:14.345
Like I said, it was
the least I could do.

01:02:14.347 --> 01:02:16.082
I should've told
you two sooner.

01:02:18.050 --> 01:02:19.919
I'm so sorry.

01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:39.373
What are you doin'? What's it
look like I'm doin'? I'm packin'.

01:02:40.507 --> 01:02:41.772
Where are you gonna go?

01:02:41.774 --> 01:02:45.245
The last thing I wanna do is be
a burden on you and my daughter.

01:02:45.946 --> 01:02:48.314
You're not a burden,
Eduardo, okay?

01:02:48.316 --> 01:02:50.348
We like havin' you here.

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:53.118
Do you know what
the penalty for perjury is?

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.390
Man, stop playin'.
You're not goin' anywhere.

01:02:57.024 --> 01:02:58.025
What?

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:00.061
Hold on.

01:03:01.195 --> 01:03:03.194
You got <i>The Pravda Protocol</i>
first edition?

01:03:03.196 --> 01:03:05.433
Yeah.
And <i>The Azerbaijan Accord.</i>

01:03:06.534 --> 01:03:08.567
You got
<i>The Moldavian Manuscripts.</i>

01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:11.270
What... and you got
<i>The Warsaw Wire?</i>

01:03:11.272 --> 01:03:12.874
Not one of your best titles.

01:03:13.475 --> 01:03:16.309
Where'd you get these?
I bought 'em.

01:03:16.311 --> 01:03:18.177
You know I would've got
you some copies for free.

01:03:18.179 --> 01:03:20.447
Yeah, but I figured
if I paid for 'em,

01:03:20.449 --> 01:03:22.817
it would help
your sales figures, and...

01:03:23.385 --> 01:03:29.255
I kinda like the idea of having a
son-in-law on the best-sellers' list.

01:03:29.257 --> 01:03:31.625
Yeah? Even one that's not good
enough for your daughter?

01:03:31.627 --> 01:03:33.562
All fathers say that.

01:03:35.464 --> 01:03:38.033
In your case, I was wrong.

01:03:39.133 --> 01:03:41.003
I'm really proud of you, Frank.

01:03:43.372 --> 01:03:45.575
And I'm proud to be
your father-in-law.

01:03:50.512 --> 01:03:52.381
Does that mean
I could call you Dad?

01:03:53.650 --> 01:03:55.017
Don't push it.

01:04:00.457 --> 01:04:02.457
Ah. Okay.

01:04:02.459 --> 01:04:05.992
Hey, so you think we can get
Granddaddy Day Care back on its feet?

01:04:05.994 --> 01:04:08.963
You know, with you being a
writer and me being a lawyer,

01:04:08.965 --> 01:04:12.401
if we put our heads together,
I know we can come up with somethin'.

01:04:12.403 --> 01:04:16.237
[indistinct]
These books are a mess.

01:04:16.239 --> 01:04:19.173
Who did your taxes,
anyway, a chimpanzee?

01:04:19.175 --> 01:04:20.942
Is there anything
you can do for him, Walter?

01:04:20.944 --> 01:04:22.544
Well, of course I can.

01:04:22.546 --> 01:04:26.280
I'm a CPA.
Certified Public Accountant.

01:04:26.282 --> 01:04:28.417
Now, the first thing we'll do

01:04:28.419 --> 01:04:31.387
is to file for a tax extension.

01:04:31.389 --> 01:04:34.289
That'll give you
an extra 30 days.

01:04:34.291 --> 01:04:36.125
Thirty days?
Yeah.

01:04:36.127 --> 01:04:38.128
I can't come up with
all that money in 30 days.

01:04:39.397 --> 01:04:40.631
You won't have to.

01:04:41.599 --> 01:04:44.266
We're gonna sue the bastards.

01:04:44.268 --> 01:04:46.904
["The Bull" by Mike Theodore
Orchestra playing]

01:04:52.076 --> 01:04:54.646
[no audible dialogue]

01:05:11.731 --> 01:05:13.633
[music continues]

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:28.345
If it may please the court,
the issue before us today

01:05:28.347 --> 01:05:31.682
is not that of
a simple code violation,

01:05:31.684 --> 01:05:36.353
but a larger Constitutional
right to free association

01:05:36.355 --> 01:05:39.590
guaranteed us
by the First Amendment.

01:05:39.592 --> 01:05:41.292
What do you think
of that, Frank?

01:05:41.294 --> 01:05:43.127
Oh, that was
pretty good, man.

01:05:43.129 --> 01:05:44.763
But you might
wanna consider pants.

01:05:44.765 --> 01:05:47.132
Oh! Yeah. [laughs]

01:05:47.134 --> 01:05:49.100
What do you think, Jordie?
Pants, no pants?

01:05:49.102 --> 01:05:50.403
Whatever.

01:05:51.103 --> 01:05:52.369
What's the matter with you?

01:05:52.371 --> 01:05:53.707
Nothing.

01:06:06.453 --> 01:06:08.086
[video game noises]

01:06:08.088 --> 01:06:10.357
I guess I'll just
iron my pants.

01:06:13.828 --> 01:06:16.061
[beeps]

01:06:16.063 --> 01:06:18.098
Frank.
Yeah.

01:06:20.535 --> 01:06:25.073
You know sometimes "nothing"
isn't really nothing.

01:06:25.573 --> 01:06:30.010
I wasn't a good father to Emma
when she was a little girl.

01:06:31.346 --> 01:06:33.281
Don't make the same mistake.

01:06:36.452 --> 01:06:38.085
[knocking]

01:06:38.853 --> 01:06:41.623
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:06:43.157 --> 01:06:44.627
So...

01:06:46.161 --> 01:06:47.728
I just talked to your grandpa.

01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:50.731
Sorry I wasn't payin'
attention, man, you know?

01:06:50.733 --> 01:06:52.499
No big deal.
How was the audition?

01:06:52.501 --> 01:06:53.734
Take a guess.

01:06:53.736 --> 01:06:54.803
Ah...

01:06:55.571 --> 01:06:58.372
I didn't even wanna be
in the stupid show.

01:06:58.374 --> 01:07:00.508
And now Annie's gonna
find out I bombed,

01:07:00.510 --> 01:07:03.410
and she'll probably ignore me
for the rest of the year.

01:07:03.412 --> 01:07:07.180
Or, maybe she'll
see what I see,

01:07:07.182 --> 01:07:09.884
which is a very brave young
man who tried somethin' new.

01:07:09.886 --> 01:07:11.352
And failed.

01:07:11.354 --> 01:07:12.887
[scoffs]

01:07:12.889 --> 01:07:16.658
You know how many books I had to write
before gettin' my first one published?

01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:18.493
I don't know.

01:07:18.495 --> 01:07:20.228
Twenty-three.

01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:22.797
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

01:07:22.799 --> 01:07:24.432
So, you know,
success and failures,

01:07:24.434 --> 01:07:26.400
that's just two sides
of the same coin.

01:07:26.402 --> 01:07:28.202
You only really fail
at something

01:07:28.204 --> 01:07:30.840
if you didn't give it a shot
in the first place, so...

01:07:31.741 --> 01:07:34.344
Whatever happened,
just remember this.

01:07:35.211 --> 01:07:37.715
I'm always proud of you.
Always.

01:07:38.582 --> 01:07:39.716
Okay?

01:07:43.153 --> 01:07:44.789
[doorbell rings]

01:07:45.823 --> 01:07:47.756
[sobbing]

01:07:47.758 --> 01:07:50.291
Millie?
Millie, what's wrong?

01:07:50.293 --> 01:07:53.798
It's Blanche!

01:08:00.572 --> 01:08:02.871
She was a wonderful woman.

01:08:02.873 --> 01:08:05.641
She was always so polite.

01:08:05.643 --> 01:08:07.844
[loudly]
She had a very sweet smile.

01:08:07.846 --> 01:08:10.614
Kind word for everyone.

01:08:10.616 --> 01:08:13.652
She found
my EpiPen in my purse,

01:08:14.452 --> 01:08:16.220
and that's not easy.

01:08:17.723 --> 01:08:21.256
What's the matter with you people? You're
talking about her as if she's dead!

01:08:21.259 --> 01:08:23.193
Well, she might as well be.

01:08:23.194 --> 01:08:25.732
Her kids have put her in the
worst nursing home in the state.

01:08:27.499 --> 01:08:31.336
[Gabe] <i>Shady Side Acres is basically
the last stop before you're worm food.</i>

01:08:32.504 --> 01:08:37.575
[loudly] I heard they serve
tapioca pudding with every meal.

01:08:37.577 --> 01:08:39.408
[all groaning]

01:08:39.411 --> 01:08:42.580
Okay, but come on, you guys,
we gotta do somethin'!

01:08:42.582 --> 01:08:45.282
You can't just sit around here
complainin' like a bunch of old...

01:08:45.283 --> 01:08:46.319
Hmm?

01:08:51.323 --> 01:08:54.892
Old people.
Go ahead, say it, Frank.

01:08:54.894 --> 01:08:57.763
- I didn't mean that.
- Why not? We are old people.

01:08:57.765 --> 01:09:01.999
Do you know how long it takes
me to get out of the bathtub?

01:09:02.001 --> 01:09:05.236
Knee acts up
every time it rains.

01:09:05.238 --> 01:09:07.639
And I get to hear about it,
every time it rains.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.675
[loudly] I take so many
pills in the morning,

01:09:09.676 --> 01:09:12.345
I rattle when I walk.
[chuckles]

01:09:13.514 --> 01:09:15.281
Okay, fine.

01:09:19.386 --> 01:09:20.554
You're old.

01:09:21.721 --> 01:09:23.823
But that doesn't mean
you're useless.

01:09:23.825 --> 01:09:27.926
Collectively, there's about 500 years'
worth of life experience in this room.

01:09:27.928 --> 01:09:30.362
Sure, you put your teeth
in a glass by the bed.

01:09:30.363 --> 01:09:33.032
Okay, maybe parts of your body
are sagging like cheap luggage,

01:09:33.033 --> 01:09:35.600
and so what, you need
to pee every 20 minutes.

01:09:35.603 --> 01:09:37.403
Ten.

01:09:37.404 --> 01:09:39.638
The point is,
your friend is in trouble,

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.541
and if you don't help her,

01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:43.845
you're worse off than she is
in that nursin' home.

01:09:44.879 --> 01:09:47.314
You might as well
already be dead.

01:09:51.019 --> 01:09:52.687
My son-in-law is right.

01:09:53.688 --> 01:09:56.656
We can't just let that
wonderful woman rot in there

01:09:56.658 --> 01:09:59.762
because her stepdaughter
doesn't wanna deal with her.

01:10:00.663 --> 01:10:02.497
We've gotta do somethin'.

01:10:03.298 --> 01:10:04.699
I'm in.

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:07.701
- We're in.
- We're in.

01:10:07.703 --> 01:10:10.671
- I'm in!
- All right, I'm in too.

01:10:10.673 --> 01:10:13.373
As long as you schedule
bathroom breaks.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:17.878
Look, I hate to be the
naysayer here, but, Dad?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.982
Did you forget you have
a court appointment tomorrow?

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:24.988
You're supposed to be appearing before
the judge to save Granddaddy Day Care.

01:10:26.756 --> 01:10:30.390
You're right.
Something like this means

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:34.431
breakin' into Blanche's
nursing home, finding her,

01:10:35.499 --> 01:10:39.268
avoiding the security guard,
getting her out of there,

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:43.607
and makin' it to court
by 10:00 a.m.

01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:52.549
I'm in.

01:10:54.351 --> 01:10:58.654
[Big Lou] Okay, now, the
main entrance is right here.

01:10:58.656 --> 01:11:02.524
We've got side entrances
here and here,

01:11:02.526 --> 01:11:04.960
but they're all locked
from the inside.

01:11:04.962 --> 01:11:07.997
They've got security guards
24 hours a day.

01:11:07.999 --> 01:11:11.935
They've got cameras in the
hallways recording everything.

01:11:11.937 --> 01:11:16.472
The alarm system engages the moment
a resident steps off the property.

01:11:16.474 --> 01:11:17.842
Well, it looks impossible.

01:11:18.609 --> 01:11:21.377
In 'Nam it was all
in a day's work.

01:11:21.379 --> 01:11:22.748
[Millie] Here.

01:11:23.615 --> 01:11:27.016
I was gonna give these
to my grandkids for Christmas.

01:11:27.018 --> 01:11:30.022
Last year
they gave me a fruitcake.

01:11:30.989 --> 01:11:33.557
Screw 'em.

01:11:33.559 --> 01:11:36.426
[Gabe] I don't know.
The place looks like Fort Knox.

01:11:36.428 --> 01:11:38.695
You think they're gonna just
let us walk in the front door?

01:11:38.697 --> 01:11:40.699
We're gonna have to be
very smart...

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.969
and very, very inconspicuous.

01:11:44.971 --> 01:11:49.808
Yes. Whatever we do, we must
not call attention to ourselves.

01:12:17.971 --> 01:12:19.372
Please hold.

01:12:20.007 --> 01:12:21.505
May I help you?

01:12:21.507 --> 01:12:23.942
Yes.
We're from 1-800-Clowns.

01:12:23.944 --> 01:12:25.979
You ordered some
entertainment for today?

01:12:27.847 --> 01:12:31.183
There must be some mistake. I don't see
anything about this on our schedule.

01:12:31.185 --> 01:12:34.987
Better check again, lady. We didn't get
all dressed up like this for nothin'.

01:12:34.989 --> 01:12:36.956
What's wrong, Cujo?

01:12:36.958 --> 01:12:39.658
You smell a kitty-cat?
[barks]

01:12:39.660 --> 01:12:42.461
You can't go back there without a pass!
Come back here!

01:12:42.463 --> 01:12:44.163
[Millie barks]
Wait here.

01:12:44.165 --> 01:12:46.600
- [Big Lou] Don't you take her dog!
- Come back here!

01:12:47.002 --> 01:12:48.503
You can't...

01:12:49.004 --> 01:12:51.570
[Frank laughs]

01:12:51.572 --> 01:12:52.873
Let's go.

01:13:02.150 --> 01:13:04.052
Hmm. E-6.

01:13:04.753 --> 01:13:05.787
Miss.

01:13:06.821 --> 01:13:08.855
[Gabe] Blanche Clark.
Room 113.

01:13:08.857 --> 01:13:10.490
There you go, Gabe.
All right.

01:13:10.492 --> 01:13:11.959
You two,
keep security busy.

01:13:11.961 --> 01:13:14.029
Eduardo,
let's go get Blanche.

01:13:17.832 --> 01:13:20.069
Come back here!
Ooh!

01:13:23.839 --> 01:13:25.907
Security.
We have a situation.

01:13:27.944 --> 01:13:30.945
I think Velma's been dippin'
into the pill stash again.

01:13:30.947 --> 01:13:32.048
She said she saw
a bunch of clowns.

01:13:32.949 --> 01:13:35.818
Stay here.
I better check this out.

01:13:38.553 --> 01:13:39.789
What are you doin' here?

01:13:40.122 --> 01:13:41.655
Huh?

01:13:41.657 --> 01:13:43.093
[grunting]

01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:52.235
There it is. 113.

01:13:55.305 --> 01:13:57.574
Wait, wait, look.

01:14:00.610 --> 01:14:01.945
[chuckles]

01:14:04.047 --> 01:14:06.815
Sal. We just lost another one.

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:08.186
Sal!

01:14:09.753 --> 01:14:11.856
Ah! Ah! Hey!

01:14:20.298 --> 01:14:22.031
Blanche?

01:14:22.033 --> 01:14:23.833
It's me, Eduardo.

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:25.869
We've come to get
you outta here.

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:28.773
Ah!

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:30.942
[both grunt]

01:14:34.579 --> 01:14:36.681
[phone ringing]

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:46.023
[Gabe, high voice] <i>Front desk.</i>
Velma, call the cops.

01:14:46.025 --> 01:14:47.991
The place is
crawlin' with clowns.

01:14:47.993 --> 01:14:49.761
Will do. [chuckles]

01:14:52.031 --> 01:14:54.698
B-Bozo to Emmett.
Come in, Emmett.

01:14:54.700 --> 01:14:56.869
Uh...
W-What's your 20? Over.

01:14:57.770 --> 01:15:00.938
Yeah, yeah, our "20" is that you
sent us to the wrong room, Gabe.

01:15:00.940 --> 01:15:02.672
Are you sure it says 113?

01:15:02.674 --> 01:15:06.977
Uh... Oh, whoops.
[chuckles] It's 118. My bad.

01:15:06.979 --> 01:15:08.982
<i>I guess I do need glasses.</i>

01:15:09.816 --> 01:15:11.315
[sighs] All right,
this better be the one,

01:15:11.317 --> 01:15:13.817
because we have less than
an hour to get you to court.

01:15:13.819 --> 01:15:15.621
It's this way.
It's this way.

01:15:26.199 --> 01:15:27.901
You're going down.

01:15:29.836 --> 01:15:31.071
Excuse me.

01:15:32.406 --> 01:15:34.739
You think Grandpa's
gonna make it here on time?

01:15:34.741 --> 01:15:38.142
Oh, he has to, honey. [clears
throat] Or we're in big trouble.

01:15:38.144 --> 01:15:39.913
All rise.

01:15:47.288 --> 01:15:48.923
Let's see.

01:15:50.056 --> 01:15:54.426
We have City Social Services
versus Frank Collins.

01:15:54.428 --> 01:15:56.063
Approach the bench.

01:15:57.698 --> 01:16:00.133
Um... Your Honor?
[chuckles]

01:16:00.135 --> 01:16:02.236
May I have a word with you?

01:16:09.377 --> 01:16:10.777
Blanche!

01:16:10.779 --> 01:16:12.745
Eduardo! [gasps]

01:16:12.747 --> 01:16:15.950
Eduardo! Oh!

01:16:16.717 --> 01:16:18.218
How did you know it was me?

01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:20.920
I'd recognize
those eyes anywhere.

01:16:20.922 --> 01:16:22.989
[laughs] Okay, okay.
Pack up your stuff.

01:16:22.991 --> 01:16:24.391
We're gonna get you outta here.
Oh, okay.

01:16:24.393 --> 01:16:26.025
You don't have
to ask me twice. Oh!

01:16:26.027 --> 01:16:28.161
Hey, Emmett to Chuckles,
Emmett to Chuckles.

01:16:28.163 --> 01:16:29.395
We're leavin'
the Big Top, baby.

01:16:29.397 --> 01:16:30.799
What?

01:16:31.234 --> 01:16:33.635
[radio beeps]
What's goin' on?

01:16:45.348 --> 01:16:48.450
Got you, and your
little invisible dog too.

01:16:48.452 --> 01:16:49.386
[laughs]

01:16:53.756 --> 01:16:55.725
[groaning]

01:16:56.726 --> 01:16:58.826
[alarm blaring]

01:16:58.828 --> 01:17:00.397
Now what?

01:17:01.898 --> 01:17:05.435
[groaning]

01:17:07.504 --> 01:17:12.276
[electronic voice] <i>Attention.
Attention. Attention.</i>

01:17:13.976 --> 01:17:16.847
What do we do now?
We blend in.

01:17:17.447 --> 01:17:19.447
<i>...walk to
the nearest stairway exit.</i>

01:17:19.449 --> 01:17:22.420
[continues, indistinct]

01:17:34.265 --> 01:17:37.135
[blaring continues]

01:18:01.793 --> 01:18:03.328
Clowns!

01:18:12.204 --> 01:18:15.005
We did it! [laughs]

01:18:15.007 --> 01:18:18.308
We're not outta the woods yet. We
still don't have Big Lou and Bonnie.

01:18:18.310 --> 01:18:20.279
Let's go. Let's go.
Oh.

01:18:23.583 --> 01:18:27.119
Hey, Emmett to Jingles.
Emmett to Jingles.

01:18:28.254 --> 01:18:29.354
[whispers]
Emmett to Jingles.

01:18:29.356 --> 01:18:31.091
[electrical buzzing]

01:18:31.924 --> 01:18:33.927
Who's laughin' now, clown?

01:18:35.095 --> 01:18:36.928
[gasps] Let him go!

01:18:36.930 --> 01:18:38.128
Hey, lady.
Oh!

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.231
Easy.
[shrieks]

01:18:40.233 --> 01:18:41.767
Let go of my wife!
What?

01:18:44.237 --> 01:18:47.306
Lou! [chuckles]

01:18:47.308 --> 01:18:50.208
You've always been my hero.

01:18:50.210 --> 01:18:51.011
There they are!

01:18:52.078 --> 01:18:53.246
Ah!

01:18:58.185 --> 01:19:00.221
No man left behind!

01:19:05.959 --> 01:19:08.029
[squealing]

01:19:18.406 --> 01:19:20.607
There's definitely a better route.
I know, I know.

01:19:20.609 --> 01:19:24.411
You're driving too fast. You could
look at Google or Waze or something.

01:19:24.413 --> 01:19:26.011
What are you talkin' about?

01:19:26.013 --> 01:19:28.417
[sound becomes muffled]

01:19:29.917 --> 01:19:32.218
Your Honor,
with all due respect,

01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:34.289
are we really gonna
wait for them all day?

01:19:37.359 --> 01:19:40.560
That's it. I'm calling it.
The court rules in favor of...

01:19:40.562 --> 01:19:43.532
Your Honor,
I was unavoidably detained.

01:19:45.668 --> 01:19:48.969
Well, I imagine you have a really
good explanation, Mr. Hernandez.

01:19:48.971 --> 01:19:50.337
I certainly do, Your Honor.

01:19:50.339 --> 01:19:52.238
Are you ready to proceed?

01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:54.009
Yes, Your Honor.
I am.

01:19:58.381 --> 01:20:03.284
Eduardo Hernandez for the
petitioner, Mr. Frank Collins.

01:20:03.286 --> 01:20:08.055
This case is a perfect example
of regulatory overreach.

01:20:08.057 --> 01:20:10.625
This seems to me that
your client was operating

01:20:10.627 --> 01:20:14.931
an illegal elder day care facility
and got caught with his pants down.

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:19.202
No, that's not what...

01:20:21.037 --> 01:20:22.437
Uh...

01:20:22.439 --> 01:20:24.506
No, that's not what...

01:20:24.508 --> 01:20:28.976
It was like more of a...
Where is...

01:20:28.978 --> 01:20:31.446
Wait a minute.
It was a... What...

01:20:31.448 --> 01:20:33.515
Mr. Hernandez,
are you all right?

01:20:33.517 --> 01:20:36.552
Wait a minute.
Hold... No!

01:20:36.554 --> 01:20:39.521
He... It was more of a...

01:20:39.523 --> 01:20:41.256
Grandpa's losing it.
What was I sayin'?

01:20:41.258 --> 01:20:44.059
Uh... Your Honor, it's...

01:20:44.061 --> 01:20:45.062
Hey, hey, hey.

01:20:46.398 --> 01:20:48.398
The regulations
are overreaching.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:51.601
- Who the hell are you?
- Dad?

01:20:51.603 --> 01:20:54.202
Mr. Collins, I'm afraid we're
gonna have to put an end to this.

01:20:54.204 --> 01:20:56.339
No, no, please, Your Honor. Just
give us a minute. He'll be okay.

01:20:56.341 --> 01:20:58.141
Hey, Eduardo.
Look at me. Look at me.

01:20:58.143 --> 01:21:00.143
Where are we?
We're in court.

01:21:00.145 --> 01:21:02.177
Everybody is here waitin'
to hear you tell 'em about

01:21:02.179 --> 01:21:04.282
how you argued in front
of Judge Hightower.

01:21:05.383 --> 01:21:06.684
Judge Hightower.

01:21:14.592 --> 01:21:17.393
Class A moron.

01:21:17.395 --> 01:21:19.463
[chuckles]
[judge clears throat]

01:21:19.465 --> 01:21:21.567
What does that
have to do with this?

01:21:40.419 --> 01:21:42.722
Your Honor, it's true.

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:48.193
We used a 102-C license

01:21:48.195 --> 01:21:51.696
to run a 105-D facility.

01:21:51.698 --> 01:21:55.533
It's also true that
we have not yet complied

01:21:55.535 --> 01:22:00.575
with the code requirements
of a 105-D facility.

01:22:01.307 --> 01:22:05.811
But neither of these
are the real point.

01:22:05.813 --> 01:22:10.816
The real point is that this
capricious and vindictive fine

01:22:10.818 --> 01:22:16.187
goes to the very heart of our
right for freedom of association.

01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:20.159
It was done without
notice or warning.

01:22:20.161 --> 01:22:24.698
And more importantly, it violates our
right to remedy the transgressions.

01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:28.167
It's unconstitutional
and un-American.

01:22:28.169 --> 01:22:31.470
And that's why only
a class A moron

01:22:31.472 --> 01:22:33.540
could try to get away
with something like this.

01:22:33.542 --> 01:22:35.809
Your Honor! I-I object!

01:22:35.811 --> 01:22:39.080
You can't object.
Your lawyer has to object.

01:22:39.647 --> 01:22:42.214
Save your breath.
Overruled.

01:22:42.216 --> 01:22:46.753
Now, Mr. Tooley, when did you
cite Mr. Collins' facility?

01:22:46.755 --> 01:22:49.121
On the fifth, Your Honor.

01:22:49.123 --> 01:22:52.526
Now, you didn't
inspect the premises

01:22:52.528 --> 01:22:54.496
prior to issuing the citation?

01:22:55.831 --> 01:23:00.768
No! Well, we didn't have a warrant
to enter the premises, so...

01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:02.869
So he had no notice
of the violations?

01:23:02.871 --> 01:23:05.405
Mm, well, we visited
Mr. Collins' facility

01:23:05.407 --> 01:23:07.407
on a number of occasions...

01:23:07.409 --> 01:23:09.175
But he did
not have the chance

01:23:09.177 --> 01:23:12.148
to rectify any transgressions
prior to the fine.

01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:15.549
He had plenty of time
to comply.

01:23:15.551 --> 01:23:17.785
Plenty of time to comply.
Thank you, Mr. Tooley.

01:23:17.787 --> 01:23:20.223
But... But...
Thank you.

01:23:22.325 --> 01:23:25.860
Your Honor, if it may
please the court,

01:23:25.862 --> 01:23:30.498
all these people here have come
to support Granddaddy Day Care.

01:23:30.500 --> 01:23:32.901
Do you think they all
would've come this far

01:23:32.903 --> 01:23:37.371
if they didn't really believe
in what my son-in-law was doing?

01:23:37.373 --> 01:23:40.141
Yeah, he bent a few rules,

01:23:40.143 --> 01:23:43.378
but he opened his house
to some senior citizens

01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:46.448
so that they could
have some fun,

01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:49.152
enjoy each other's company,
and maybe, for a change,

01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:51.287
feel valued.

01:23:52.556 --> 01:23:54.625
And in the end, Your Honor,

01:23:55.626 --> 01:23:58.162
isn't that what
we all really want?

01:24:05.937 --> 01:24:08.871
You know, none of us
are getting any younger.

01:24:08.873 --> 01:24:12.208
Now, Mr. Collins, you
probably broke a few rules,

01:24:12.210 --> 01:24:14.311
but your heart is
in the right place.

01:24:15.547 --> 01:24:18.514
The $50,000 fine
is hereby vacated.

01:24:18.516 --> 01:24:21.551
- [gasping, exclaiming]
- Your Honor...

01:24:21.553 --> 01:24:25.590
But, Mr. Collins, I will not
let you ignore the regulations.

01:24:26.658 --> 01:24:29.561
You have 90 days to bring
your facility up to code.

01:24:30.228 --> 01:24:31.596
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:24:33.399 --> 01:24:35.635
And, Mr. Hernandez?

01:24:36.935 --> 01:24:38.203
Yes, Your Honor?

01:24:39.939 --> 01:24:42.906
It's good to see you on that
side of the courtroom, Eduardo.

01:24:42.908 --> 01:24:45.211
[chuckles]
Thank you, Bill.

01:24:46.212 --> 01:24:48.312
I find for the plaintiff.

01:24:48.314 --> 01:24:49.915
[cheering]

01:24:56.322 --> 01:24:58.255
You did it, Eduardo.
Thank you.

01:24:58.257 --> 01:25:00.358
Why don't we cut that
"Eduardo" stuff out, okay?

01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:01.792
Okay. Eddie?

01:25:01.794 --> 01:25:05.329
Ah, why don't we try "Dad"?

01:25:05.331 --> 01:25:06.767
Let's try it!

01:25:10.637 --> 01:25:12.774
I am so proud of you.

01:25:13.439 --> 01:25:14.507
Oh!

01:25:21.015 --> 01:25:22.617
There he is!

01:25:24.918 --> 01:25:28.353
How dare you take my stepmother
out of her nursing home?

01:25:28.355 --> 01:25:31.791
And how dare you not abide
by your stepmother's wishes?

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:34.493
Who the hell are you? I'm
your stepmother's attorney.

01:25:34.495 --> 01:25:36.362
And the first thing
we're going to do

01:25:36.364 --> 01:25:39.330
is contest her
late husband's will.

01:25:39.332 --> 01:25:42.401
Well, there's no reason
to reopen probate.

01:25:42.403 --> 01:25:45.271
Yeah, we don't need
no lawyer gettin' involved.

01:25:45.273 --> 01:25:46.739
Okay, good.

01:25:46.741 --> 01:25:50.042
Why don't we ask your mother
what her wishes are?

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:51.412
Of course.

01:25:51.979 --> 01:25:54.815
Mom, where do you wanna live?

01:25:54.817 --> 01:25:58.286
I want to live in my house.

01:25:58.787 --> 01:26:01.921
Of course.
Whatever you want, Mom.

01:26:01.923 --> 01:26:03.924
We just wanna
make you happy.

01:26:03.926 --> 01:26:05.892
[Eduardo]
Oh, good, good.

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:08.628
Why don't I draw up some
paperwork to make it formal?

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:10.064
Not that I don't trust you...

01:26:10.066 --> 01:26:11.700
but I don't.

01:26:14.703 --> 01:26:15.971
Let's go.

01:26:17.639 --> 01:26:18.741
Good!

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:20.977
Good.

01:26:24.414 --> 01:26:25.912
I'm gonna party.

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:27.016
Of course he is.

01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:32.520
So, now what?

01:26:32.522 --> 01:26:35.090
You heard the judge.
We've got work to do.

01:26:35.092 --> 01:26:37.959
Hmm.
[chuckles]

01:26:37.961 --> 01:26:40.997
["We Came to Get Down"
by Alexandrite playing]

01:26:45.335 --> 01:26:47.705
Five.
Yeah. Nice.

01:26:52.408 --> 01:26:55.443
Have you ever blown up
a full-size van?

01:26:55.445 --> 01:26:57.579
No. No.
What'd you say?

01:26:57.581 --> 01:26:59.782
I said, "No."
I work with computers.

01:26:59.784 --> 01:27:01.616
Computers, man.
What're you sayin'?

01:27:01.618 --> 01:27:02.887
No!

01:27:06.924 --> 01:27:09.525
Nice turn out.
Yeah, huh?

01:27:09.527 --> 01:27:11.027
Listen,

01:27:11.029 --> 01:27:13.296
I've been thinkin' about
what you said before...

01:27:14.665 --> 01:27:16.999
about goin' to see a doctor?
Mm-hmm.

01:27:17.001 --> 01:27:19.737
Why don't we make
an appointment for next week?

01:27:20.772 --> 01:27:22.741
Okay. Great.

01:27:23.942 --> 01:27:26.441
What brought on
this change of heart?

01:27:26.443 --> 01:27:29.679
Uh... Let's say I just
got a lot goin' on,

01:27:29.681 --> 01:27:32.115
and I don't wanna
miss a thing.

01:27:32.117 --> 01:27:34.953
[chuckles] Yeah.

01:27:38.156 --> 01:27:39.825
[sighs]

01:27:50.001 --> 01:27:51.670
Hi, Jordan.

01:27:52.504 --> 01:27:55.405
Hey, Annie.
What are you doin' here?

01:27:55.407 --> 01:27:57.510
I came with my grandparents.

01:27:58.444 --> 01:28:00.477
I heard about
your audition.

01:28:00.479 --> 01:28:02.081
Sorry.

01:28:03.481 --> 01:28:06.650
I didn't really wanna be
in the show anyways.

01:28:06.652 --> 01:28:07.887
So, why'd you do it?

01:28:08.855 --> 01:28:10.989
I thought that
if I was in the show,

01:28:10.991 --> 01:28:12.792
we'd get to hang out together.

01:28:13.693 --> 01:28:17.595
Jordan, you didn't have to
audition to hang out with me.

01:28:17.597 --> 01:28:20.868
I've wanted to talk to you since
I first saw you in physics class.

01:28:22.202 --> 01:28:24.768
Really?
Really.

01:28:24.770 --> 01:28:27.705
Hey, since I never got
to see your audition,

01:28:27.707 --> 01:28:30.876
could you maybe sing
your song for me sometime?

01:28:30.878 --> 01:28:32.746
Anytime.

01:28:36.617 --> 01:28:37.985
Chip?

01:28:44.092 --> 01:28:46.861
[polka music playing]

01:28:47.195 --> 01:28:49.129
[both laugh]

01:28:53.902 --> 01:28:55.469
Whoa.

01:28:57.939 --> 01:29:01.107
Well, now that we have Granddaddy
Day Care back up and running,

01:29:01.109 --> 01:29:02.844
you can get back
to your book.

01:29:03.778 --> 01:29:05.611
I don't know about that.

01:29:05.613 --> 01:29:06.846
What do you mean?

01:29:06.848 --> 01:29:10.583
Well, I mean, maybe Jack
Quartermaine has had his day.

01:29:10.585 --> 01:29:14.220
Maybe it's time for me to write
about somethin' new, you know?

01:29:14.222 --> 01:29:17.859
Yeah.
Somethin' fresh and...

01:29:21.096 --> 01:29:22.498
original.

01:29:29.772 --> 01:29:31.674
Boom!
[mimics explosion]

01:29:35.711 --> 01:29:37.512
[whispers]
Hold my drink.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:42.516
[sighs]

01:29:42.518 --> 01:29:43.786
Well...

01:30:18.189 --> 01:30:21.859
[all screaming]

01:30:24.928 --> 01:30:26.661
We're trapped!

01:30:26.663 --> 01:30:28.330
What are we gonna do?

01:30:28.332 --> 01:30:31.967
What else do we do
when we come to a dead end?

01:30:31.969 --> 01:30:33.669
We bust right through!

01:30:33.671 --> 01:30:35.071
[all shouting]

01:30:35.073 --> 01:30:37.842
