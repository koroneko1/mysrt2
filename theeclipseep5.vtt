They are not intended to urge or promote any behavior in the series.

00:00:15.141 --> 00:00:17.600
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:19.745
Teacher.

00:00:19.745 --> 00:00:23.599
I’d like to ask if the Prefect Club can watch Ayan’s behavior instead.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:24.464
Thua.

00:00:24.464 --> 00:00:26.947
Whatever problem you have, you can always talk to me.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.046
Hey.

00:00:28.331 --> 00:00:29.421
Are you following me?

00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:30.447
Watch out!

00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:46.574
We’re here.

00:00:46.684 --> 00:00:47.844
What are we doing here?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.906
I want coffee.

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:50.000
Then go by yourself.

00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:51.019
I’ll wait in the car.

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.145
You can’t.

00:00:52.498 --> 00:00:54.102
Of course, I can. Why not?

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.125
What the hell do you think you’re doing?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.922
If you don't come with me,

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:28.961
I’ll post this photo.

00:01:33.732 --> 00:01:35.918
You can’t post it, Ayan.

00:01:37.233 --> 00:01:38.115
What say you?

00:01:38.884 --> 00:01:41.190
If you don’t come with me right now,

00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:42.745
I’m posting it.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.489
I’ll come.

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:48.077
But you have to delete it.

00:01:49.358 --> 00:01:50.140
Okay.

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:14.000
Welcome to Café for All.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.421
Oh, hello, Aye.

00:03:15.747 --> 00:03:17.960
Thank you for coming back here.

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:19.057
Of course.

00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:20.251
Oh?

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:23.480
You were here the other day, weren’t you?

00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:26.251
I think you’ve got the wrong guy.

00:03:27.253 --> 00:03:28.440
I doubt it.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.325
You were here with a good-looking friend.

00:03:30.325 --> 00:03:30.941
Weren’t you?

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:37.466
Never mind that. Just make yourselves at home, Aye and…

00:03:38.118 --> 00:03:38.967
Akk.

00:03:39.202 --> 00:03:40.253
His name is Akk.

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:41.528
Akk.

00:03:41.528 --> 00:03:42.661
Nice to meet you.

00:03:42.661 --> 00:03:43.424
Yes.

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:44.575
Make yourselves at home.

00:03:44.575 --> 00:03:45.172
Yes, Golf.

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:46.042
I’ll send a staff to take your order soon.

00:03:46.042 --> 00:03:46.646
Please.

00:03:46.646 --> 00:03:47.453
Thank you.

00:03:50.388 --> 00:03:51.104
So?

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:03.527
Can you just admit you followed me here?

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:05.322
I didn’t follow you here.

00:04:05.687 --> 00:04:07.687
I just saw a lot of reviews about this place.

00:04:07.892 --> 00:04:09.100
So I asked Kan to come here.

00:04:09.892 --> 00:04:11.546
I gotta give it to you, Akk.

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.404
You slithered out of that, alright.

00:04:14.287 --> 00:04:15.373
Stop talking.

00:04:15.373 --> 00:04:16.287
Give me your phone.

00:04:16.287 --> 00:04:17.445
I’m deleting that photo.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:19.171
Nope.

00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:21.920
Don’t be a pain.

00:04:22.135 --> 00:04:23.529
I came in here with you.

00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:25.272
Now you keep your word.

00:04:33.107 --> 00:04:34.033
I’ll delete it.

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:46.474
I told you to delete it.

00:04:46.474 --> 00:04:47.423
Why the hell did you send it to me?

00:04:47.558 --> 00:04:49.185
I deleted it off my phone.

00:04:49.953 --> 00:04:51.105
But on yours,

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.293
you can decide for yourself if you want to delete or save it.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:55.752
Of course I’m deleting it.

00:04:55.752 --> 00:04:56.930
Why would I save it?

00:04:59.217 --> 00:05:00.122
Okay.

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:06.961
Why are you taking me here?

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:13.166
I know

00:05:15.107 --> 00:05:17.852
that you talked to all the teachers not to gang up on me.

00:05:22.091 --> 00:05:24.044
I talk to the teachers all the time.

00:05:24.433 --> 00:05:25.622
You’re overthinking it.

00:05:26.763 --> 00:05:29.414
I don’t know why you helped me.

00:05:30.602 --> 00:05:31.419
But, well…

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:35.449
Thank you.

00:05:38.725 --> 00:05:42.356
I didn’t know “thank you” was part of your vocabulary.

00:05:43.374 --> 00:05:46.841
Oh, I’ve got loads of vocabulary, actually.

00:05:48.164 --> 00:05:49.791
Why don’t you try and find out more?

00:05:55.441 --> 00:05:56.537
Stop messing with me.

00:05:58.563 --> 00:06:00.000
Take me back.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.975
I have work to do.

00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:03.445
Golf.

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:05.167
One more of this, please.

00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:08.945
Are you deaf?

00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:10.092
I said I have to go back.

00:06:10.092 --> 00:06:11.178
I have work to do.

00:06:14.355 --> 00:06:15.140
It's empty.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.398
[You’re paired with me for tomorrow’s Judo class.]

00:06:48.951 --> 00:06:49.786
[Yeah.]

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.640
Hi, Mom.

00:07:07.364 --> 00:07:08.799
Did you turn it on?

00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:09.703
Okay.

00:07:09.703 --> 00:07:11.081
Now do you see the long button?

00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:12.394
Click the space bar.

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.020
Yes.

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.240
Now click on a right click.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.102
There’ll be a menu bar appearing.

00:07:17.921 --> 00:07:18.912
Yes.

00:07:19.448 --> 00:07:21.063
Now double click it.

00:07:21.953 --> 00:07:22.626
Yes.

00:07:22.626 --> 00:07:23.580
Look at him.

00:07:24.841 --> 00:07:26.400
The school forbids using phones.

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:27.464
But he’s still using it.

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:29.128
Kan.

00:07:31.131 --> 00:07:32.011
Just let him be.

00:07:33.131 --> 00:07:34.507
But he’s breaking the rule.

00:07:34.761 --> 00:07:36.109
Didn’t you hear him?

00:07:36.794 --> 00:07:39.493
It sounds like he’s teaching an adult how to use a computer.

00:07:40.255 --> 00:07:42.441
I think it could be something very important to him.

00:07:45.297 --> 00:07:46.333
Now I feel guilty.

00:07:48.197 --> 00:07:49.907
You’re being weird today, Akk.

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:51.039
Yeah.

00:07:51.691 --> 00:07:53.008
But I agree with you.

00:07:54.266 --> 00:07:57.987
We can’t just judge people without hearing their reasons.

00:07:59.078 --> 00:08:00.566
Now I feel really guilty.

00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:02.288
You make me look bad.

00:08:08.980 --> 00:08:10.817
I’m really sorry.

00:08:10.817 --> 00:08:12.406
But no one is home right now.

00:08:12.406 --> 00:08:13.942
My mother really needed to use the computer.

00:08:13.942 --> 00:08:14.740
So I—

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:15.623
It’s okay.

00:08:17.759 --> 00:08:19.759
But next time you have an urgent need to use your phone,

00:08:20.185 --> 00:08:23.443
contact the Student Welfare Dept. or the Prefect Club.

00:08:24.464 --> 00:08:25.387
I will.

00:08:25.387 --> 00:08:26.394
Thank you.

00:08:31.239 --> 00:08:32.205
Really weird.

00:08:33.631 --> 00:08:34.288
Yep.

00:08:34.707 --> 00:08:35.701
Totally weird.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:37.440
But not bad. I like it.

00:08:37.589 --> 00:08:38.543
His change?

00:08:38.543 --> 00:08:40.000
Him. As if!

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:40.757
Wait, what?

00:08:40.992 --> 00:08:42.177
I was asking seriously, man.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:43.425
You’re the weird one.

00:08:43.425 --> 00:08:43.933
Me?

00:08:43.933 --> 00:08:44.775
He’s the weird one.

00:08:44.775 --> 00:08:45.408
You are.

00:08:45.408 --> 00:08:45.989
Okay, then.

00:08:45.989 --> 00:08:46.850
Oh, Kan.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:47.350
What?

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:48.784
Pair with me for Judo class.

00:08:49.079 --> 00:08:50.217
Of course, my man.

00:08:50.527 --> 00:08:52.240
I promise to go easy on you, Wat.

00:08:52.426 --> 00:08:53.183
You’d better.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.255
By the way, Akk.

00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:56.975
Who will you pair with?

00:08:57.482 --> 00:08:58.713
Who else but Aye?

00:08:59.039 --> 00:09:01.877
He promised the teacher he would train with Aye.

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.723
Didn’t you?

00:09:06.264 --> 00:09:07.139
I guess so.

00:09:08.676 --> 00:09:10.244
What a burden.

00:09:10.244 --> 00:09:11.758
He never learns what I teach him.

00:09:14.121 --> 00:09:15.168
You guys go ahead.

00:09:15.168 --> 00:09:16.633
I have something to submit to a teacher.

00:09:16.633 --> 00:09:17.471
Sure.

00:09:17.471 --> 00:09:17.971
Okay.

00:09:17.971 --> 00:09:19.026
- See you.
- See you, man.

00:09:43.459 --> 00:09:45.000
You’ve always been so unyielding.

00:09:45.149 --> 00:09:47.149
Why did you let them do this to you?

00:09:55.973 --> 00:09:58.253
You won’t be mean to me like they are, will you?

00:10:08.044 --> 00:10:08.819
Give me your phone.

00:10:09.005 --> 00:10:10.000
I’m deleting that photo.

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:14.215
I told you to delete it.

00:10:14.215 --> 00:10:15.313
Why the hell did you send it to me?

00:10:15.375 --> 00:10:17.040
I deleted it off my phone.

00:10:18.974 --> 00:10:20.229
But on yours,

00:10:22.719 --> 00:10:24.439
you can decide for yourself if you want to delete or save it.

00:10:32.347 --> 00:10:33.904
Why didn’t you reply to my texts?

00:10:52.057 --> 00:10:53.405
You said you’d delete it.

00:10:54.911 --> 00:10:56.911
I–I’m deleting it right now.

00:11:03.168 --> 00:11:04.095
Why are you smiling?

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:05.793
Nothing.

00:11:08.276 --> 00:11:09.601
Why aren’t you at the dojo?

00:11:09.761 --> 00:11:11.295
You’re paired with me.

00:11:11.543 --> 00:11:12.417
Did you forget?

00:11:12.906 --> 00:11:14.498
Judo isn’t a one-man sport, you know.

00:11:15.744 --> 00:11:19.188
Who asked you to act up so much that no one wants to pair with you?

00:11:22.792 --> 00:11:24.036
So you’re not deleting it?

00:11:27.227 --> 00:11:27.983
I am.

00:11:30.401 --> 00:11:31.228
Wait.

00:11:31.857 --> 00:11:33.030
What now?

00:11:33.996 --> 00:11:36.369
If you’re going to delete it, can you do it somewhere else?

00:11:38.294 --> 00:11:39.502
Don’t do it in front of me.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:46.809
I will.

00:11:56.914 --> 00:11:58.005
Akk.

00:12:01.677 --> 00:12:02.892
Are you really not going back to class?

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.785
Yeah.

00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:06.304
If you do this, our whole class will be in trouble, too.

00:12:08.942 --> 00:12:09.897
Where have you been?

00:12:11.108 --> 00:12:12.456
I went to get Aye.

00:12:12.456 --> 00:12:13.508
I didn’t want him to miss another test.

00:12:13.508 --> 00:12:15.087
What’s the matter?

00:12:42.129 --> 00:12:45.195
One, two, three, four.

00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:48.738
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:12:48.738 --> 00:12:49.925
Louder!

00:12:50.883 --> 00:12:54.274
One, two, three, four.

00:12:54.531 --> 00:12:55.928
Alright, one!

00:12:57.358 --> 00:12:59.914
You bastards, do it in sync!

00:12:59.914 --> 00:13:00.713
Two!

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:04.898
In sync!

00:13:04.991 --> 00:13:06.403
Or else I’ll start again.

00:13:06.403 --> 00:13:07.205
Four!

00:13:08.403 --> 00:13:09.161
Five!

00:13:14.202 --> 00:13:15.924
Get ready for the next one.

00:13:16.856 --> 00:13:18.856
Do it with more rigor!

00:13:18.856 --> 00:13:19.857
Get ready.

00:13:22.289 --> 00:13:24.011
Don’t dawdle. Start again!

00:13:24.011 --> 00:13:24.718
One!

00:13:26.609 --> 00:13:27.575
Two!

00:13:29.035 --> 00:13:31.019
Too slow! Faster.

00:13:31.019 --> 00:13:31.818
Three!

00:13:34.153 --> 00:13:37.173
Do it in sync or I’ll start from the top.

00:13:37.946 --> 00:13:38.996
Keep your core tight.

00:13:38.996 --> 00:13:39.725
Four!

00:13:42.654 --> 00:13:43.742
Do it properly!

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:45.442
Five!

00:14:15.164 --> 00:14:15.889
You jerk.

00:14:16.074 --> 00:14:17.627
You took my notebook, didn’t you?

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:19.393
What the hell?

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:20.669
I didn’t.

00:14:20.669 --> 00:14:22.031
If it’s not you, then who?

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.171
I don’t know.

00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:24.250
But I didn’t take it.

00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:25.640
If you don’t give it back to me,

00:14:25.758 --> 00:14:28.216
I’m telling everyone what this stupid school did.

00:14:29.183 --> 00:14:30.471
Stop sprouting nonsense.

00:14:30.633 --> 00:14:31.438
All of you.

00:14:32.171 --> 00:14:36.952
Do you want to know what the curse of this stupid school actually is?

00:14:37.231 --> 00:14:38.999
I told you to shut up!

00:14:41.317 --> 00:14:42.431
Give it back to me, jerk!

00:14:42.431 --> 00:14:44.082
I didn’t take it!

00:14:44.082 --> 00:14:45.154
- You did, Akk.
- Stop it.

00:14:45.154 --> 00:14:46.510
Stop it, both of you.

00:14:48.216 --> 00:14:49.177
Stop!

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:50.934
I said stop!

00:14:50.934 --> 00:14:51.653
Now!

00:14:58.459 --> 00:14:59.671
You bastards.

00:14:59.885 --> 00:15:01.723
Now I have to report this to the Principal.

00:15:02.771 --> 00:15:03.738
Teacher,

00:15:04.317 --> 00:15:05.976
please don’t report it.

00:15:05.976 --> 00:15:06.752
I’m begging you.

00:15:07.541 --> 00:15:09.286
Why didn’t you think before you threw that punch, then?

00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:12.728
You can punish me all you like.

00:15:13.055 --> 00:15:14.313
I’m asking for one thing.

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:16.434
Don’t report it to the Principal.

00:15:17.848 --> 00:15:19.848
Or else I’ll lose my scholarship.

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:25.755
Fine.

00:15:26.079 --> 00:15:26.910
I won’t.

00:15:28.216 --> 00:15:30.031
Only because you’re an alright student

00:15:30.324 --> 00:15:31.860
who always looks out for others.

00:15:32.623 --> 00:15:33.635
Thank you.

00:15:35.072 --> 00:15:36.060
Well…

00:15:37.213 --> 00:15:38.610
What do you need me to do?

00:15:38.795 --> 00:15:39.838
I’ll do anything.

00:15:40.877 --> 00:15:42.274
Not only you.

00:15:42.604 --> 00:15:45.114
Both of you.

00:15:59.149 --> 00:16:00.477
Hey, Akk.

00:16:01.015 --> 00:16:01.887
Aye.

00:16:02.582 --> 00:16:04.707
So what the hell was that all about?

00:16:06.944 --> 00:16:08.110
Ask your friend.

00:16:13.881 --> 00:16:15.364
Well, what is it?

00:16:16.619 --> 00:16:17.574
It’s nothing.

00:16:17.991 --> 00:16:19.963
You’re normally much calmer than this.

00:16:20.454 --> 00:16:22.825
But when it comes to Aye, you always get so hasty.

00:16:23.762 --> 00:16:24.648
It’s nothing.

00:16:25.552 --> 00:16:26.666
Nothing, my foot.

00:16:27.358 --> 00:16:28.738
I said it’s nothing.

00:16:29.619 --> 00:16:30.461
Kan,

00:16:30.832 --> 00:16:33.948
let’s talk about this later.

00:16:34.229 --> 00:16:37.017
I don’t think Akk wants to talk right now.

00:16:38.395 --> 00:16:39.327
I’ll be back.

00:16:40.395 --> 00:16:42.436
Akk, where are you going?

00:16:45.919 --> 00:16:47.201
What’s the matter with him?

00:16:55.401 --> 00:16:56.520
What is it, Akk?

00:16:57.082 --> 00:16:58.642
Is Teacher Chadok here today?

00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:01.968
Teacher Chadok went to a seminar in Bangkok.

00:17:02.662 --> 00:17:03.699
Since when?

00:17:04.093 --> 00:17:05.612
He left yesterday.

00:17:05.612 --> 00:17:08.646
But he did tell me to call him if there's any emergency.

00:17:09.247 --> 00:17:10.830
Do you have something urgent you need to talk to him about?

00:17:14.659 --> 00:17:15.517
No.

00:17:15.702 --> 00:17:16.844
Thank you, Teacher.

00:17:17.145 --> 00:17:17.956
Bye.

00:17:22.689 --> 00:17:24.295
You took my notebook, didn’t you?

00:17:24.295 --> 00:17:25.585
I didn’t.

00:17:25.585 --> 00:17:27.023
If it’s not you, then who?

00:17:31.756 --> 00:17:34.613
I wonder who stole Aye’s notebook.

00:17:35.593 --> 00:17:37.593
Yeah, I want to know, too.

00:17:38.168 --> 00:17:39.274
Would be nice if it’s a “who.”

00:17:43.216 --> 00:17:45.083
I’m afraid it might be the curse of Suppalo.

00:17:48.217 --> 00:17:49.078
Damn it.

00:17:49.495 --> 00:17:50.819
You gave me goosebumps.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:57.173
I think Aye always carries that notebook with him at all time.

00:17:58.409 --> 00:17:59.783
I bet he’s feeling really bad right now

00:18:00.168 --> 00:18:01.225
for losing it.

00:18:01.828 --> 00:18:03.930
You look so concerned about him, Thua.

00:18:10.362 --> 00:18:11.397
Oh, Akk.

00:18:11.861 --> 00:18:12.826
Where have you been?

00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:14.576
Nowhere.

00:18:16.801 --> 00:18:18.097
He hasn’t come back to class

00:18:19.244 --> 00:18:20.319
ever since he got into a fight with you.

00:18:29.937 --> 00:18:31.071
Attention!

00:18:31.462 --> 00:18:33.995
Hello, Teacher.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:36.046
We’re having a quiz today.

00:18:36.492 --> 00:18:40.647
I’ll let you study your notes for 15 minutes.

00:18:40.956 --> 00:18:42.028
Then we’ll begin.

00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.509
Yes, ma’am.

00:18:44.787 --> 00:18:45.643
Where’s Ayan?

00:18:53.325 --> 00:18:54.236
Start reviewing.

00:19:26.875 --> 00:19:28.039
What are you doing sleeping here?

00:19:33.323 --> 00:19:34.159
None of your business.

00:19:35.207 --> 00:19:36.452
I’m here to get you back to class.

00:19:37.727 --> 00:19:39.386
We had a quiz just now.

00:19:39.682 --> 00:19:42.864
If there’s another in the afternoon class, you’ll miss out again.

00:19:52.185 --> 00:19:53.513
Are you really not going back to class?

00:19:53.977 --> 00:19:54.649
Yeah.

00:19:56.253 --> 00:19:58.786
If you do this, our whole class will be in trouble, too.

00:19:59.561 --> 00:20:00.615
Yeah. I know.

00:20:01.125 --> 00:20:02.071
I’ll be back.

00:20:03.178 --> 00:20:04.436
Just let me sleep a little longer.

00:20:30.135 --> 00:20:31.095
Where have you been?

00:20:34.177 --> 00:20:35.541
I went to get Aye back to class.

00:20:35.541 --> 00:20:36.566
I didn’t want him to miss another test.

00:20:37.537 --> 00:20:39.189
Why? What’s the matter?

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:41.120
Nothing.

00:20:42.001 --> 00:20:43.216
I just came to see you.

00:20:43.673 --> 00:20:46.113
I’m afraid Aye might talk you into joining that gang.

00:20:47.105 --> 00:20:48.076
Oh, that.

00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:50.588
Let’s get back to class.

00:21:19.196 --> 00:21:20.292
Alright, let’s go.

00:21:38.318 --> 00:21:39.947
Take a bite, Singto.

00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:41.580
Singto, eat.

00:21:43.898 --> 00:21:44.641
Singto.

00:21:47.867 --> 00:21:49.496
I’m not buying you food anymore.

00:21:50.157 --> 00:21:51.184
You arrogant bastard.

00:22:10.355 --> 00:22:11.891
I really didn’t take your notebook.

00:22:17.065 --> 00:22:18.439
I know I want it.

00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:20.332
But it isn’t me this time.

00:22:24.318 --> 00:22:25.497
I know it’s not you.

00:22:26.682 --> 00:22:28.054
You were with me the entire time.

00:22:30.634 --> 00:22:32.495
But I got really angry so I…

00:22:33.868 --> 00:22:34.889
I didn’t think it through.

00:22:36.604 --> 00:22:38.216
Was that an apology?

00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:40.707
If you think so.

00:22:43.001 --> 00:22:43.843
Wait.

00:22:49.709 --> 00:22:51.871
You threatened to tell everyone about the school’s curse…

00:22:52.516 --> 00:22:53.682
What did you mean by that?

00:22:56.163 --> 00:22:58.951
Does the student prefect title mean that much to you?

00:22:59.299 --> 00:23:00.015
Yes.

00:23:00.586 --> 00:23:02.122
It allows me to help this school.

00:23:03.055 --> 00:23:07.720
Here I thought you wanted the Best Behavior quota to get into college with a scholarship.

00:23:08.594 --> 00:23:09.597
That, too.

00:23:10.807 --> 00:23:14.406
In my opinion, something like that doesn’t suit you at all.

00:23:17.377 --> 00:23:18.247
Why?

00:23:18.919 --> 00:23:20.814
Am I such a wimp in your opinion?

00:23:22.542 --> 00:23:25.840
Why must you act all tamed just to get some rewards from those people?

00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:30.099
Is it wrong of me to do whatever it takes to get the same privilege as everyone else?

00:23:30.324 --> 00:23:32.139
Someone who was born with such privilege like you

00:23:32.248 --> 00:23:33.692
can move school whenever you want.

00:23:34.017 --> 00:23:35.090
What would you understand?

00:23:49.749 --> 00:23:50.544
What the hell?

00:23:57.196 --> 00:23:59.590
Son, I’m sorry.

00:24:00.197 --> 00:24:01.826
The timer is a little off.

00:24:03.009 --> 00:24:04.754
Are you alright?

00:24:04.921 --> 00:24:06.194
I’m not alright, sir.

00:24:06.194 --> 00:24:07.222
I’m soaked.

00:24:13.689 --> 00:24:14.624
But I am alright, sir.

00:24:16.293 --> 00:24:17.358
Hey!

00:24:20.109 --> 00:24:21.228
Wait for me.

00:24:23.111 --> 00:24:24.203
And?

00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.216
Does it trouble you that this is the way we are?

00:24:29.823 --> 00:24:30.633
Wasuwat.

00:24:31.606 --> 00:24:32.796
What’s the matter?

00:24:37.082 --> 00:24:40.496
In my opinion, this kind of thing suits you more.

00:24:56.807 --> 00:24:58.144
Do I have to go now, Dad?

00:24:58.807 --> 00:24:59.704
Can’t I go tomorrow?

00:25:00.424 --> 00:25:02.600
Your aunt is leaving soon.

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:03.957
She’s waiting.

00:25:04.445 --> 00:25:05.703
You have to go now.

00:25:06.321 --> 00:25:06.939
Yes.

00:25:11.307 --> 00:25:12.682
It won’t ever dry soon enough.

00:25:28.663 --> 00:25:29.388
What are you doing?

00:25:29.876 --> 00:25:30.975
Take my jacket.

00:25:31.205 --> 00:25:32.190
You’re in a hurry, aren’t you?

00:25:32.787 --> 00:25:34.787
I’ll take yours to the laundry.

00:25:34.865 --> 00:25:35.828
I’ll return it tomorrow.

00:25:37.142 --> 00:25:38.517
Think fast or you’ll be late.

00:25:45.527 --> 00:25:46.650
Want me to give you a ride?

00:25:47.177 --> 00:25:47.937
No need.

00:25:47.937 --> 00:25:48.854
I can go by myself.

00:25:54.941 --> 00:25:56.014
In my opinion,

00:25:56.658 --> 00:25:58.405
this kind of thing suits you more.

00:25:59.749 --> 00:26:00.583
No way.

00:26:00.895 --> 00:26:02.061
I don’t want to be like you.

00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:04.520
But you haven’t even tried.

00:26:05.418 --> 00:26:06.871
How’d you know you don’t?

00:26:09.333 --> 00:26:10.339
I just know it.

00:26:10.710 --> 00:26:12.563
Give that to me. I’ll do the laundry myself.

00:26:12.966 --> 00:26:14.205
I said give it to me.

00:26:44.782 --> 00:26:45.415
Give it to me.

00:27:23.192 --> 00:27:24.450
Why does it have to be you?

00:27:49.946 --> 00:27:51.052
Oh, hell!

00:27:51.325 --> 00:27:53.078
Doesn’t he know what a turn signal is?

00:27:53.078 --> 00:27:53.966
What the hell?

00:27:54.443 --> 00:27:56.219
I need to teach him a lesson.

00:27:56.709 --> 00:27:58.162
Honey, just forget it.

00:27:59.073 --> 00:27:59.971
Yes, Dad.

00:27:59.971 --> 00:28:00.722
Just forget it.

00:28:00.722 --> 00:28:01.600
It’s alright.

00:28:02.037 --> 00:28:02.569
Oh,

00:28:03.311 --> 00:28:04.271
you’re here, too?

00:28:04.497 --> 00:28:06.497
And here I thought it was just the two of us with all the silence.

00:28:07.655 --> 00:28:09.870
I’m sorry. I was thinking.

00:28:10.239 --> 00:28:12.571
You’re a man. You don’t need to think so much, Thuaphu.

00:28:12.945 --> 00:28:15.746
You’re too soft. That’s why you’re always bullied.

00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:19.959
I have to go. Bye.

00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.310
Wait, darling.

00:28:32.246 --> 00:28:32.847
You faggots!

00:28:33.764 --> 00:28:34.694
And?

00:28:34.867 --> 00:28:38.253
Does it trouble you that this is the way we are?

00:28:38.934 --> 00:28:40.387
So you don’t know?

00:28:40.603 --> 00:28:42.281
Know what?

00:28:42.476 --> 00:28:44.594
It does trouble all of us.

00:28:45.282 --> 00:28:48.649
Wherever I go, everyone asks

00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:50.173
if I go to a faggot school.

00:28:53.288 --> 00:28:55.991
Everyone else tries to uphold the school’s reputation.

00:28:56.325 --> 00:28:59.262
But you lot only destroy it.

00:29:26.288 --> 00:29:28.600
It would be nice to disappear.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:44.251
[It would be nice to disappear.]

00:29:48.864 --> 00:29:50.298
Ever since I remarried,

00:29:51.139 --> 00:29:54.232
I’ve never seen you express any feelings.

00:29:55.074 --> 00:29:55.725
I thought…

00:29:57.074 --> 00:29:59.072
nothing was wrong.

00:29:59.916 --> 00:30:01.447
Nothing is wrong, Mom.

00:30:02.565 --> 00:30:03.618
Dad is…

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:07.357
nice to me.

00:30:26.614 --> 00:30:30.430
[Bruce Wayne wants to be your friend.]
[Accept/Deny]

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.425
Bruce Wayne?

00:30:39.263 --> 00:30:40.365
[Accept]

00:30:45.136 --> 00:30:46.882
[Bruce Wayne: Hi. What’s your name?]

00:30:50.765 --> 00:30:51.847
Who is it?

00:30:57.623 --> 00:30:59.623
[Thuaphu. You?]

00:31:03.916 --> 00:31:08.318
[I’m Bruce Wayne. Nice to meet you.]

00:31:20.717 --> 00:31:24.259
[Student Welfare Department]

00:31:36.873 --> 00:31:37.604
Wasuwat.

00:31:37.604 --> 00:31:38.248
Yes?

00:31:39.372 --> 00:31:40.381
What’s the matter?

00:31:41.474 --> 00:31:43.461
Err, Teacher.

00:31:44.511 --> 00:31:48.756
You told me the other day that I don’t look like I enjoy class.

00:31:49.654 --> 00:31:50.525
Actually…

00:31:51.864 --> 00:31:52.905
I like films.

00:31:54.682 --> 00:31:57.847
But not the blockbuster type.

00:31:58.347 --> 00:32:00.503
I mean another type of film.

00:32:01.481 --> 00:32:02.416
Indie films?

00:32:03.744 --> 00:32:04.555
Yes.

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:06.108
You know about that?

00:32:07.769 --> 00:32:11.643
I happen to have a cinephile friend who’s into indie films.

00:32:13.050 --> 00:32:13.888
That’s nice.

00:32:15.372 --> 00:32:18.233
Did you talk to your family about your interest?

00:32:21.472 --> 00:32:24.858
They said it’s nonsense.

00:32:25.671 --> 00:32:27.241
They said it’s not a good job.

00:32:29.259 --> 00:32:31.161
It’s not as stable as something like being an engineer.

00:32:34.897 --> 00:32:36.233
Isn’t it hard being a teenager?

00:32:39.507 --> 00:32:40.882
But you know what, Wasuwat?

00:32:42.133 --> 00:32:45.949
You don’t always need to do as others expect of you.

00:32:50.653 --> 00:32:52.653
Well, I’m off to class.

00:32:53.672 --> 00:32:54.374
Yes.

00:32:54.804 --> 00:32:56.004
Thank you.

00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:09.622
How is the situation?

00:33:09.954 --> 00:33:13.184
The group supporting The World Remembers is gaining momentum.

00:33:14.594 --> 00:33:15.450
Stop it.

00:33:15.665 --> 00:33:19.445
Isn’t this an obvious abuse of power, student prefect?

00:33:21.178 --> 00:33:22.885
Why did you want to be a student prefect?

00:33:23.310 --> 00:33:24.568
Why’d you want to know?

00:33:54.807 --> 00:33:56.807
Has it really been only three days?

00:33:57.106 --> 00:33:59.663
And that Kala-guy wants us to do this for a whole month?

00:34:02.059 --> 00:34:03.270
His name’s Kalakul.

00:34:03.422 --> 00:34:05.677
You’ll be in trouble if he walks in here and hears you make fun of his name.

00:34:11.098 --> 00:34:12.608
Have you found your notebook?

00:34:13.978 --> 00:34:14.803
No.

00:34:18.262 --> 00:34:18.958
Akk.

00:34:21.388 --> 00:34:23.249
Why did you want to be a student prefect?

00:34:25.068 --> 00:34:26.557
I told you.

00:34:27.189 --> 00:34:28.887
It’s the only position that allows me to help this school.

00:34:29.243 --> 00:34:30.686
No, not that.

00:34:31.789 --> 00:34:33.789
I want to know what got you interested.

00:34:34.238 --> 00:34:35.750
What inspired you, that kind of thing.

00:34:36.508 --> 00:34:37.670
Why’d you want to know?

00:34:37.949 --> 00:34:39.623
No reason. I just want to know.

00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.180
When I first started here,

00:34:51.493 --> 00:34:53.400
it felt like I had a sign on my forehead labelling,

00:34:53.806 --> 00:34:55.226
“country bumpkin.”

00:34:55.588 --> 00:34:57.959
I got bullied a lot for that.

00:34:58.591 --> 00:35:00.591
I lost control and punched them in the face.

00:35:02.164 --> 00:35:03.133
You?

00:35:03.508 --> 00:35:04.539
Yeah.

00:35:05.013 --> 00:35:08.545
After that, I was taken to the Student Welfare Department.

00:35:08.949 --> 00:35:12.017
I met Teacher Dika, the assistant teacher of the Department.

00:35:12.486 --> 00:35:14.091
The one your old school stole away.

00:35:16.228 --> 00:35:18.065
My life got turned around after that.

00:35:18.065 --> 00:35:18.762
Because he was just…

00:35:18.762 --> 00:35:19.677
- so understanding.
- understanding.

00:35:28.319 --> 00:35:29.308
What happened next?

00:35:30.469 --> 00:35:32.668
Teacher Dika was an assistant teacher to Teacher Chadok.

00:35:32.668 --> 00:35:35.016
So Teacher Chadok took me to see Mes.

00:35:35.341 --> 00:35:37.573
He was the previous student prefect.

00:35:38.191 --> 00:35:40.191
Is everything alright for the Srisuppalo event?

00:35:40.191 --> 00:35:41.274
Yes, sir.

00:35:41.505 --> 00:35:42.600
Is there anything else left to do?

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:45.637
Only to compile a list of some students.

00:35:45.637 --> 00:35:46.255
Alright.

00:35:46.255 --> 00:35:48.185
You can consult Teacher Dika about that.

00:35:48.185 --> 00:35:49.155
Teacher.

00:35:49.551 --> 00:35:50.450
I’ll leave it to you.

00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:51.133
Yes.

00:35:54.338 --> 00:35:55.113
Hello, teachers.

00:35:56.901 --> 00:35:57.801
Akk, isn’t it?

00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.008
Yes.

00:35:59.468 --> 00:36:01.782
This is Mes, Head of the Prefect Club.

00:36:05.032 --> 00:36:06.015
Hello.

00:36:09.416 --> 00:36:11.668
You know what, the first time I met him,

00:36:11.939 --> 00:36:13.333
it just sort of clicked.

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:15.076
I wanted to be like him.

00:36:17.833 --> 00:36:20.506
So that was how your obsession with this stupid school came from.

00:36:22.049 --> 00:36:23.770
If you don’t stop disrespecting my school,

00:36:24.634 --> 00:36:26.193
I’m going to wrestle you to the ground, Shortstop.

00:36:33.431 --> 00:36:35.663
I could kiss you again, Big Foot.

00:36:38.614 --> 00:36:39.778
Stop it.

00:36:46.053 --> 00:36:47.960
How is Teacher Dika doing?

00:37:08.579 --> 00:37:09.560
I have to go.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:12.188
My mother asks me to do something for her.

00:37:28.058 --> 00:37:29.478
I said stop filming.

00:37:29.897 --> 00:37:31.897
Ouch! Look!

00:37:31.897 --> 00:37:32.863
Teacher!

00:37:34.722 --> 00:37:38.440
Stop making a ruckus if you don’t want to be in trouble.

00:37:39.227 --> 00:37:40.577
Help, y’all.

00:37:40.577 --> 00:37:43.305
Look at this. This teacher is threatening me.

00:37:43.305 --> 00:37:44.126
I can’t do this.

00:37:44.126 --> 00:37:45.573
We can’t keep living like this.

00:37:45.573 --> 00:37:47.319
We need more people for the protest next time.

00:37:47.319 --> 00:37:50.788
- Come out and join us, everyone. 
- Hey, help me out.

00:37:50.788 --> 00:37:52.974
They’re doing it again.

00:37:54.035 --> 00:37:55.524
Help, all of you. Help!

00:37:55.524 --> 00:37:56.885
I said stop recording!

00:37:58.248 --> 00:37:59.014
Nun.

00:37:59.014 --> 00:38:00.503
My phone…

00:38:01.940 --> 00:38:03.104
This is too much.

00:38:03.104 --> 00:38:04.543
You’re going too far.

00:38:30.759 --> 00:38:37.681
[The World Remembers: Dear all Suppalo students, come out to protest under the campaign #ProtestAgaistTheCurse.]

00:38:37.681 --> 00:38:38.525
[The teacher is going too far.]

00:38:38.525 --> 00:38:41.275
[Let’s see if the curse can really hurt you.]
[What is the executive even doing?]

00:38:42.641 --> 00:38:47.188
[The faggots are the problem. Hope the curse got them dead.] 
[I hope the ghosts of all Suppalo past students kill them!]

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.908
The gang is using social media to gather support from outside of school.

00:38:53.112 --> 00:38:54.948
Teacher Chadok is still at the seminar.

00:38:55.242 --> 00:38:57.788
But he told us to take care of this matter as soon as possible.

00:38:57.788 --> 00:38:58.861
Yes, ma’am.

00:38:59.577 --> 00:39:01.182
How is the situation?

00:39:01.645 --> 00:39:03.645
There are three groups of opinions right now.

00:39:04.295 --> 00:39:07.595
The group supporting The World Remembers is gaining momentum.

00:39:07.595 --> 00:39:09.903
But the group supporting the school is still bigger.

00:39:11.010 --> 00:39:12.430
And the third group?

00:39:13.135 --> 00:39:15.135
It’s the silent group who’s not taking sides.

00:39:15.991 --> 00:39:20.127
If we let this grow, I’m afraid there might be a riot.

00:39:21.450 --> 00:39:23.241
Let’s hope it doesn’t come to that.

00:39:23.802 --> 00:39:27.188
If the curse of Suppalo comes back, then we can stop them.

00:39:27.769 --> 00:39:29.281
The curse again?

00:39:31.233 --> 00:39:32.978
But they got cursed already.

00:39:33.675 --> 00:39:34.513
Yes.

00:39:35.563 --> 00:39:37.006
First, their stuff started disappearing.

00:39:37.324 --> 00:39:38.860
Then, they got into some little accidents,

00:39:39.136 --> 00:39:40.207
and then some car accidents.

00:39:40.796 --> 00:39:42.448
According to the legend, there’s one more incident left.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:45.368
Getting burned.

00:39:50.786 --> 00:39:52.531
This is such a banger.

00:39:52.531 --> 00:39:53.998
It’s really pretty, isn’t it?

00:39:53.998 --> 00:39:54.681
Yeah.

00:39:58.337 --> 00:39:59.073
Nong.

00:39:59.886 --> 00:40:02.357
Once you finish this sign, can you make another one for me?

00:40:02.357 --> 00:40:03.170
Which one do you want?

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:04.682
The “Stop violence” one.

00:40:04.788 --> 00:40:06.308
I think it needs more.

00:40:06.308 --> 00:40:07.521
I’ll get right to it.

00:40:07.521 --> 00:40:09.310
Art and craft is my thing.

00:40:09.629 --> 00:40:13.068
Damn, who’s as great as you?

00:40:13.068 --> 00:40:14.713
You’re pretty and talented.

00:40:14.713 --> 00:40:16.371
It’s nothing to brag about, sis.

00:40:16.371 --> 00:40:18.414
Make way, please. Let a sister pass.

00:40:18.537 --> 00:40:19.777
Move.

00:40:19.777 --> 00:40:20.723
You wench.

00:40:20.723 --> 00:40:22.983
Be careful. Just go around us.

00:40:22.983 --> 00:40:24.019
But I wanted to walk past here.

00:40:24.019 --> 00:40:25.974
Did you think this was a fashion show, Nian?

00:40:28.898 --> 00:40:29.947
Hey!

00:40:31.572 --> 00:40:32.523
Stop it.

00:40:32.922 --> 00:40:36.547
Isn’t this an obvious abuse of power, student prefect?

00:40:37.018 --> 00:40:38.071
I am not abusing my power.

00:40:38.744 --> 00:40:39.948
This is a warning.

00:40:39.948 --> 00:40:40.848
Out of concern.

00:40:41.656 --> 00:40:43.656
I don’t want the curse going after you again.

00:40:43.864 --> 00:40:45.214
Curse?

00:40:47.343 --> 00:40:49.988
Stop using some stupid urban legend to scare us off.

00:40:49.988 --> 00:40:51.214
There is no such thing as a curse.

00:40:52.083 --> 00:40:52.986
We are…

00:40:53.427 --> 00:40:54.756
not afraid.

00:40:55.834 --> 00:40:57.346
What are you being so stubborn for?

00:40:57.448 --> 00:40:59.123
Give that back.

00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:01.445
He ruined it.

00:41:15.414 --> 00:41:17.809
Thua, did you get this message?

00:41:21.689 --> 00:41:25.895
[Don’t protest if you don’t want to be the next victim of the Suppalo curse.]

00:41:25.895 --> 00:41:26.777
What is this?

00:41:27.133 --> 00:41:27.833
I don’t know.

00:41:39.557 --> 00:41:42.555
Nong, why didn’t you turn the light on?

00:41:43.216 --> 00:41:45.518
But I could see just fine.

00:41:45.518 --> 00:41:48.541
Gosh, I am so tired.

00:41:48.798 --> 00:41:49.996
Look at this.

00:41:50.576 --> 00:41:51.773
Come on.

00:41:52.026 --> 00:41:53.066
It won’t be too long now.

00:41:53.345 --> 00:41:54.955
Maybe our school will be a better place.

00:41:56.282 --> 00:41:57.203
Guys.

00:41:57.203 --> 00:41:58.282
What now, Nong?

00:41:58.282 --> 00:41:59.871
Look at this.

00:42:00.604 --> 00:42:06.876
The comments supporting our campaign double from last time, guys.

00:42:06.876 --> 00:42:08.352
Oh, I am so glad.

00:42:08.352 --> 00:42:10.876
So many people are supporting us.

00:42:11.909 --> 00:42:18.228
Tomorrow, we’ll make the school reconsider those outdated rules.

00:42:20.290 --> 00:42:21.733
Just a little further, guys.

00:42:22.983 --> 00:42:23.915
A little further.

00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:26.051
Let’s make this worth all the insults from our parents.

00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:29.499
Make it worth being unfollowed by so many friends.

00:42:29.499 --> 00:42:33.299
Make it worth being a freak in the teachers’ opinions.

00:42:34.605 --> 00:42:35.518
I really believe it.

00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.047
Tomorrow…

00:42:38.587 --> 00:42:39.705
will be better than this.

00:42:42.003 --> 00:42:42.873
Nian,

00:42:43.337 --> 00:42:44.281
Nong…

00:42:45.509 --> 00:42:46.707
Fight or flee?

00:42:47.682 --> 00:42:48.832
Fight or flee?

00:42:49.386 --> 00:42:50.258
Fight!

00:42:50.537 --> 00:42:51.479
Yes!

00:42:53.285 --> 00:42:54.665
Nong.

00:42:54.665 --> 00:42:56.237
Nun.

00:43:54.908 --> 00:43:56.258
[Just because it’s a long-time rule]

00:43:56.258 --> 00:43:57.442
[doesn’t mean it should continue.]

00:44:37.029 --> 00:44:40.190
Is it you who’s brining the Suppalo curse back?

00:44:40.629 --> 00:44:42.021
The eclipse is coming.

00:44:42.021 --> 00:44:43.188
I don’t want you to get caught up in that curse.

00:44:43.188 --> 00:44:44.285
How could I?

00:44:44.969 --> 00:44:46.505
I just want them to stop.

00:44:46.814 --> 00:44:48.094
I don’t want to hurt anybody.

00:44:49.565 --> 00:44:51.936
What would you do if someone got killed?

00:44:51.936 --> 00:44:55.275
If I can’t do it, everyone will be disappointed in me.

00:44:55.275 --> 00:44:56.927
There’s no best way out.
