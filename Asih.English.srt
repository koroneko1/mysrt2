1
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:04,250
Good evening.
What's your name?

2
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,791
I am Riri.

3
00:01:06,375 --> 00:01:08,500
Sis, this is Asih.

4
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:10,958
Who is Asih?

5
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:15,500
I have to get home.

6
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:26,375
You call her "kuntilanak."

7
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:29,333
I know her as...

8
00:01:30,375 --> 00:01:31,500
Asih.

9
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:34,083
37 YEARS BEFORE DANUR

10
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:24,625
Rain, rain, go away

11
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:32,541
It's raining in the village
And it's cloudy here

12
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:40,916
Who's the little girl in a veil?

13
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:48,708
Take a glance at her, and you will stumble

14
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:55,166
Oh, oh

15
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:59,166
Sweet girl

16
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:04,291
Bathing in the river

17
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:07,958
Her hair is all wet

18
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:15,083
If you don't pray or fast

19
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:23,333
You will be tortured in your grave

20
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:30,916
You've put together the crib.

21
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:35,166
There's still a month to go, right?

22
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,000
I know.

23
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,958
But Andi can't wait.

24
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:43,083
He said this might make the baby
come out earlier.

25
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,291
He's funny.

26
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,541
Ita!

27
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,791
Where did you get that?

28
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,250
It's from my colleague.

29
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,500
What do you think?

30
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:25,166
That thing looks older than me.

31
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,583
You're funny, Mom.

32
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,458
Let's use it for now.

33
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:34,500
-We can get a new one on my next payday.
-Okay.

34
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,333
Mom!

35
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,375
Please don't exert yourself.

36
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,500
Just ask me
and let me pump the water for you.

37
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:05,833
Okay?

38
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,916
There, it's full.

39
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,375
Come on.

40
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,375
Mom.

41
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,416
Don't you need a towel in the bathroom?

42
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,083
Thank you.

43
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,625
Ita.

44
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:59,041
Don't carry heavy things.

45
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:03,083
-Please ask me to carry them for you.
-Okay.

46
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,625
I forgot to bring them in.

47
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,833
-That's okay, Mom.
-Now, let's eat.

48
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:17,750
Tonight is my turn
to do the neighborhood watch.

49
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,208
I've passed two times already.
I should definitely do it tonight.

50
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,958
Take an umbrella.

51
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:28,125
Yeah, the weather is a bit strange today.

52
00:11:28,208 --> 00:11:30,125
It's raining, but it's warm.

53
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:34,458
They call it the rain of the dead.

54
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:38,583
Mother, people die everyday.

55
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,583
And babies are born everyday, too.

56
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,458
Here.

57
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:49,583
Thank you.

58
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:52,625
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 4, 1980

59
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:57,958
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1980
THE BIRTH DAY OF AMELIA

60
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,416
Honey?

61
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,958
Honey?

62
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,708
Mom?

63
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:57,375
Mom?

64
00:13:59,458 --> 00:14:00,708
Mom?

65
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,416
Good.

66
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:52,375
One more time.
You're almost there.

67
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,166
Breathe.

68
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:59,750
Hold it. Take a deep breath.

69
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,958
Take a deep breath.

70
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,875
Take a deep breath.

71
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,625
One more time.
The baby is almost here.

72
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,458
-You can do it.
-Push a little more.

73
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:21,666
A little bit more.
God, give her strength.

74
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:29,333
I can see the baby.
Keep pushing.

75
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,916
Keep pushing.

76
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,833
A little bit more!

77
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,458
Ita, I'm off to work now.

78
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:19,041
Bye, Amelia.

79
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,458
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace.

80
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,875
-Bye, Mother.
-Drive safely.

81
00:16:27,958 --> 00:16:29,750
Let me take her out.

82
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:33,208
Morning sunlight is good for her.

83
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:36,041
-Here we go, baby.
-Thanks, Mom.

84
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:38,000
Don't keep her out in the sun
for too long, please.

85
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,708
My baby.

86
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,875
Mom?

87
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,291
Mom?

88
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,541
Mom?

89
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:51,333
Mom?

90
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,083
Mom?

91
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,958
Mom?

92
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:08,583
The sun is already high.
We shouldn't keep Amelia in the sun.

93
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,416
It's too hot for her.

94
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:38,083
But I thought
I pushed her stroller up here.

95
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:40,166
You must've forgotten.

96
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,250
Ita?

97
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,500
Ita?

98
00:19:50,958 --> 00:19:52,083
Yes, Mom?

99
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,333
What is it, Mom?

100
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:05,750
I heard someone humming a song.
Was it you?

101
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:17,208
Have you taken your medicine?

102
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,916
-I'm not sure.
-You're not sure?

103
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:25,750
Let's check your schedule.

104
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:34,333
Thank you, but you shouldn't have.

105
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:35,750
Not at all.

106
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:38,958
My daughter is too old
to play with dolls, anyway.

107
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:45,083
Should I be concerned

108
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:47,791
that Amelia was born a month early?

109
00:20:49,041 --> 00:20:50,500
Don't worry.

110
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,291
According to the Quran,
as long as your pregnancy

111
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,958
and breastfeeding period
totals to 30 months.

112
00:20:57,041 --> 00:21:03,250
That means you must breastfeed your baby
for about two years.

113
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,750
By the way,

114
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:11,333
it's better not to put
your baby's crib near the window.

115
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:12,791
Why is that?

116
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:15,791
Spirits can peep from outside.

117
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:20,000
Until your baby is 40 days old,
you should always keep a close eye on her.

118
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:23,375
Don't take her outside for too long.

119
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,541
Especially at dusk.

120
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:34,250
When I was assisting a childbirth
in the neighboring village,

121
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:38,458
there was a rumor of a woman
committing suicide.

122
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,875
Creepy, right?

123
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:45,750
And what's worse,
they couldn't find her body.

124
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,833
They said before taking her own life,

125
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:50,041
she killed her own baby.

126
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,666
Please, I don't want to know the rest.

127
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:59,666
Please, never forget to put
a pair of scissors under your pillow.

128
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:02,583
So evil spirits won't come near.

129
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:09,750
Have you heard the knocking sounds
of the utility poles at night?

130
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:14,750
That means a wise man is walking by.

131
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:20,375
Nobody knows who he is, or how old he is.

132
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:23,541
Nobody knows where he comes from.

133
00:22:24,125 --> 00:22:27,125
The people from the neighboring village
call him "Abah."

134
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,375
Abah?

135
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:35,291
They say he knows what happened
to the spirit of that woman.

136
00:22:37,375 --> 00:22:42,750
If the number of knocks is greater
than the time of night,

137
00:22:43,333 --> 00:22:45,500
then a spirit is present.

138
00:22:49,791 --> 00:22:52,000
It makes my skin crawl.

139
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,958
Oh, oh.

140
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:44,666
My sweetie pie, how are you?

141
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,708
How is she today?

142
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:50,291
Thank goodness,
she's been very sweet all day.

143
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:54,375
What a good girl.
My sweet baby.

144
00:24:38,125 --> 00:24:40,333
Rain, rain

145
00:24:40,416 --> 00:24:44,875
Go away

146
00:24:45,916 --> 00:24:52,375
It's raining in the village
And it's cloudy here

147
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,666
Who's the little girl in a veil?

148
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:07,250
Take a glance at her, and you will stumble

149
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:14,791
Oh, oh, sweet girl...

150
00:25:21,708 --> 00:25:28,416
If you don't pray or fast

151
00:25:29,958 --> 00:25:33,041
You will be tortured

152
00:25:34,333 --> 00:25:37,000
In your grave

153
00:25:54,208 --> 00:25:56,291
Mom, bring her in!

154
00:26:05,041 --> 00:26:08,083
It's almost dark.
You have to bring Amelia inside.

155
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:10,916
I was just about to bring her inside.

156
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,458
A baby shouldn't be outside at dusk.

157
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:38,916
Ta...

158
00:26:39,416 --> 00:26:43,666
please don't raise your voice
at my mother again.

159
00:26:46,666 --> 00:26:48,125
I know, I'm sorry.

160
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,583
I was afraid
something might happen to Amelia.

161
00:27:12,583 --> 00:27:15,875
I got you. My sweetie pie.

162
00:27:21,583 --> 00:27:22,458
Ta.

163
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:25,541
Why did you put a pair of scissors
under the pillow?

164
00:27:25,625 --> 00:27:30,625
Mrs. Sekar said
it will ward off evil spirits.

165
00:27:32,541 --> 00:27:35,875
You're just being superstitious.

166
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:42,791
I'm not being superstitious.
I can feel something weird today.

167
00:27:45,666 --> 00:27:48,833
Have you buried Amelia's placenta?

168
00:27:50,416 --> 00:27:54,875
Not yet. I didn't have time this morning.

169
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,041
You shouldn't delay that kind of stuff.

170
00:27:59,375 --> 00:28:01,250
You're putting her life in danger.

171
00:28:01,833 --> 00:28:03,666
Do it tonight.

172
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:08,916
I think Amelia has a fever.

173
00:28:22,541 --> 00:28:24,083
She's a bit warm.

174
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:28,333
A little bit of crushed shallots
on her forehead will do.

175
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,125
Bury the placenta now.

176
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,583
I don't want anything to happen to Amelia.

177
00:28:36,208 --> 00:28:38,083
You haven't buried it?

178
00:28:40,208 --> 00:28:43,166
All right, I'll do it.

179
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:49,708
What has her fever got to do
with burying the placenta?

180
00:28:51,166 --> 00:28:53,500
Don't forget to say a prayer
when you bury it.

181
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:55,000
Yes, Mom.

182
00:29:41,291 --> 00:29:43,166
You're still up?

183
00:29:44,208 --> 00:29:45,791
I can't get enough breastmilk for her.

184
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:50,541
Did you eat the sweet leaves
I boiled for you yesterday?

185
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:54,750
Don't worry.

186
00:29:59,666 --> 00:30:00,958
Mom...

187
00:30:01,916 --> 00:30:06,500
I'm sorry for raising
my voice at you earlier.

188
00:30:07,916 --> 00:30:09,791
I understand your concern.

189
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,750
Don't worry about me.

190
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:15,625
I'm going to wash myself before praying.

191
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:22,875
Ita?

192
00:31:38,916 --> 00:31:40,208
Ita...

193
00:31:40,875 --> 00:31:42,625
did you just come from the kitchen?

194
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:46,666
No. But I'm about to go to bed.

195
00:31:47,416 --> 00:31:49,500
But I saw you passing the bathroom.

196
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:52,000
I thought you came from the kitchen.

197
00:31:52,583 --> 00:31:55,333
No, Mom. I was here the whole time.

198
00:31:57,083 --> 00:31:58,916
I'm going to bed now.

199
00:31:59,333 --> 00:32:01,458
Don't forget to take your medicine.

200
00:32:19,125 --> 00:32:24,833
I'm going to keep this doll in the closet.

201
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:27,833
She won't play with it, anyway.
She's too young for dolls.

202
00:32:27,916 --> 00:32:29,333
Okay.

203
00:32:35,625 --> 00:32:37,583
-Honey.
-Yes?

204
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:43,208
I think Mom's dementia is getting worse.

205
00:32:49,125 --> 00:32:50,291
Well...

206
00:32:51,125 --> 00:32:55,208
Just bear with her.
She is, after all, a grandmother, right?

207
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:58,125
There's nothing we can do.

208
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:03,083
Let's sleep.

209
00:33:15,416 --> 00:33:18,833
I'm afraid that Mom...

210
00:35:13,583 --> 00:35:16,583
Amen...

211
00:35:45,375 --> 00:35:48,833
Amen...

212
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:31,875
Amen!

213
00:36:34,666 --> 00:36:35,916
Oh, my God.

214
00:36:45,333 --> 00:36:51,916
Rain, rain, go away

215
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,416
It's raining in the village

216
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:04,125
And it's cloudy here

217
00:37:10,208 --> 00:37:17,083
Who's the little girl in a veil?

218
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:25,416
Take a glance at her

219
00:37:26,625 --> 00:37:30,458
And you will stumble

220
00:40:31,375 --> 00:40:34,583
That's my baby!

221
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:38,000
I am dead serious.
I saw a woman last night.

222
00:40:38,083 --> 00:40:40,250
Please ask the Ustād to come.

223
00:40:43,958 --> 00:40:47,750
Mom, you told me you thought
you saw me walking by you.

224
00:40:51,875 --> 00:40:55,625
-When was that?
-You don't remember?

225
00:40:58,166 --> 00:41:01,958
Ita, calm down.

226
00:41:02,041 --> 00:41:04,541
You're just being paranoid.

227
00:41:06,208 --> 00:41:07,541
I'm off to work.

228
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:11,166
Take care of your mom, Amelia.

229
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:15,250
Bye, Mom.

230
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,500
Ita!

231
00:43:59,791 --> 00:44:00,791
Mom!

232
00:44:01,791 --> 00:44:03,416
What happened, Ita?

233
00:44:07,375 --> 00:44:10,625
RAIN, RAIN, GO AWAY

234
00:44:21,541 --> 00:44:24,500
What is this, Mom?

235
00:44:25,958 --> 00:44:29,708
Mom and I heard
a woman's voice singing that song.

236
00:44:29,791 --> 00:44:32,583
Mom wrote it down in her schedule book.

237
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:44,583
So, you also feel there is
something wrong in this house?

238
00:44:49,625 --> 00:44:51,541
You have to believe us.

239
00:45:15,583 --> 00:45:20,125
What a slow night.
Just my luck.

240
00:45:20,208 --> 00:45:22,375
I'll just be catching a cold tonight.

241
00:45:22,458 --> 00:45:24,791
I'll definitely need someone
to scratch my back.

242
00:45:24,875 --> 00:45:26,750
If it goes on like this,
I'll become as thin as a skeleton.

243
00:45:29,375 --> 00:45:31,083
What's that sound?

244
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:36,291
That's odd.

245
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,541
That sounds like...

246
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:52,458
You startled me!

247
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:58,083
You look as white as a ghost.

248
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:02,333
Or did you just see one?

249
00:46:03,791 --> 00:46:06,458
You see the goose bumps
on the back of my neck?

250
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:11,291
I'd rather not, thank you very much.

251
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:16,791
I heard noises before you came.

252
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:20,666
Odd noises.

253
00:46:21,541 --> 00:46:23,041
Like a baby crying?

254
00:46:25,416 --> 00:46:28,500
Mr. Andi's wife
just gave birth a few days ago.

255
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:31,958
No, not that. I heard chicks cheeping.

256
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:35,625
Chirp... chirp... chirp...

257
00:46:37,625 --> 00:46:42,333
Mr. Andi must've buried
the baby's placenta in their yard.

258
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:45,500
Of course. It's our culture.
Where else?

259
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:46,958
In a volleyball court instead?

260
00:46:48,583 --> 00:46:51,458
Are you mocking me?

261
00:46:52,541 --> 00:46:58,250
They say if you hear chicks chirping
near where a baby's placenta is buried...

262
00:46:58,333 --> 00:47:01,291
that means a female ghost is present!

263
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:05,791
Oh, my God!

264
00:49:09,916 --> 00:49:10,958
Oh, my God!

265
00:49:11,041 --> 00:49:14,500
-You startled me, Mom.
-What's wrong, Andi?

266
00:49:15,333 --> 00:49:19,791
I saw the woman that Ita saw.

267
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,375
I believe you now, Mom.

268
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:30,625
Is that the same woman that you saw?

269
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:34,500
Oh, God.

270
00:49:37,875 --> 00:49:40,500
Why is she haunting us, Mom?

271
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:42,375
I have no idea.

272
00:49:42,458 --> 00:49:45,291
Please go to the mosque
and ask the ustad about it,

273
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:46,625
first thing in the morning.

274
00:51:20,833 --> 00:51:24,958
Amelia? Amelia!

275
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:31,291
Amelia! Amel!

276
00:51:31,375 --> 00:51:33,291
Amelia!

277
00:51:40,166 --> 00:51:44,041
I've reported the kidnapping
to Mr. Sarwono.

278
00:51:44,458 --> 00:51:46,875
And he said he'll report it to the police.

279
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:50,000
Our daughter was not kidnapped
by a living human!

280
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,500
What did the ustad say?

281
00:52:01,583 --> 00:52:07,625
Mrs. Sekar said there's a man
who knows this stuff.

282
00:52:12,875 --> 00:52:15,541
You have to go find him.

283
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,625
MIDWIFE
SEKAR NURMALA

284
00:53:46,833 --> 00:53:47,791
Abah?

285
00:54:34,333 --> 00:54:35,750
Her name is Kasih.

286
00:54:37,791 --> 00:54:41,333
A name too beautiful
for the ghastly appearance that you saw.

287
00:54:45,750 --> 00:54:47,458
No one knows exactly when...

288
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:52,500
her name became Asih.

289
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,208
Maybe...

290
00:54:56,791 --> 00:55:02,958
when she left the village
to work as a babysitter in the city.

291
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:10,166
Only to return home with a baby,
born out of wedlock.

292
00:55:14,958 --> 00:55:19,208
She was then disowned by her parents.

293
00:55:57,583 --> 00:56:00,875
The villagers also cast her
out of their village.

294
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:28,208
That poor woman

295
00:56:29,541 --> 00:56:31,166
took her own life

296
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,541
after she killed her baby.

297
00:56:40,083 --> 00:56:41,500
Tonight...

298
00:56:42,666 --> 00:56:44,208
marks the seventh day...

299
00:56:46,291 --> 00:56:48,541
since she lost her baby.

300
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:58,416
But she had been in this house...

301
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:03,000
since the night you gave birth
to your baby.

302
00:57:13,500 --> 00:57:15,166
Mom?

303
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:52,125
But can we still find my baby?

304
00:57:53,416 --> 00:57:54,583
You!

305
00:57:55,041 --> 00:57:57,416
You have something that belongs to her.

306
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:12,166
The comb.

307
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:25,375
Here.

308
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:39,916
Now I need some candles.

309
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:54,958
Please don't make any noise.

310
00:58:57,166 --> 00:58:59,125
I need total silence to listen.

311
00:59:15,333 --> 00:59:16,875
Actually...

312
00:59:18,125 --> 00:59:20,041
you don't need to hold my hand.

313
00:59:26,208 --> 00:59:27,208
Thank you.

314
00:59:39,416 --> 00:59:40,583
Asih...

315
00:59:41,958 --> 00:59:45,875
I've opened the door for you
to communicate with us.

316
00:59:49,208 --> 00:59:52,666
I summon you.
Please come, Asih!

317
01:00:22,333 --> 01:00:23,791
Stay here.

318
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:27,166
Please pray.

319
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,583
Silently.

320
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:07,375
Asih, stop playing around!

321
01:02:27,666 --> 01:02:31,250
The father, come with me now!

322
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,166
Move!

323
01:02:57,750 --> 01:02:59,541
Keep praying.

324
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:31,000
Start praying now.

325
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:43,125
Did you hear that?

326
01:04:44,833 --> 01:04:46,541
Hear what?

327
01:04:49,166 --> 01:04:50,166
Your baby's cries.

328
01:04:51,833 --> 01:04:54,416
She's behind the tree.

329
01:04:56,166 --> 01:04:58,333
Thank God.

330
01:05:53,708 --> 01:05:57,458
Mom, we found Amelia.

331
01:05:57,916 --> 01:05:59,416
Where's Ita?

332
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:03,125
Ita?

333
01:06:04,166 --> 01:06:06,916
Ita? We found Amelia.

334
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:17,041
Please take her to bed.
I'll walk Abah home.

335
01:06:26,041 --> 01:06:30,250
Mom, let Ita and Amelia rest.

336
01:06:31,958 --> 01:06:35,750
Rain, rain

337
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:40,416
Go away

338
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:48,750
It's raining in the village
And it's cloudy here

339
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:50,166
This is the smell of danur.

340
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:00,041
Asih!

341
01:07:02,458 --> 01:07:06,250
Who's the little girl...

342
01:07:09,166 --> 01:07:13,458
In a veil?

343
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:20,833
Take a glance at her...

344
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:27,375
And you will stumble

345
01:07:38,625 --> 01:07:42,250
This is my baby!

346
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:47,541
No, Asih! Your baby is in heaven now.

347
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:56,375
Give me back my baby!

348
01:07:58,166 --> 01:08:00,166
Your baby's not here, Asih.

349
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,125
Please, spare this woman.

350
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,666
She hasn't done anything to you.

351
01:08:06,625 --> 01:08:08,708
Listen to me, Asih.

352
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:12,541
I want my baby!

353
01:08:13,666 --> 01:08:16,416
Oh, my God!

354
01:08:17,541 --> 01:08:19,250
-Oh, God!
-Oh, my God!

355
01:08:19,916 --> 01:08:23,666
-Ita? Amelia!
-Oh, my God. Ita!

356
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,666
-Abah!
-Follow me!

357
01:08:44,208 --> 01:08:45,166
My God, Ita!

358
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,083
Asih! Forgive those people.

359
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,041
Forgive your past.

360
01:08:50,125 --> 01:08:53,208
I seek forgiveness from Allah, Ita.

361
01:08:53,291 --> 01:08:56,583
Forgive yourself, Asih.
Go in peace. Leave!

362
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:59,583
You have to let go of the past.
Let your baby go.

363
01:08:59,666 --> 01:09:05,750
Forgive yourself!
Forgive yourself. Go in peace.

364
01:09:06,916 --> 01:09:10,125
Enough! Leave the woman alone!

365
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:13,750
-Leave her body! Leave her alone!
-You love Amelia.

366
01:09:13,833 --> 01:09:15,625
-I seek forgiveness from Allah, Ita!
-Leave her body!

367
01:09:15,708 --> 01:09:17,500
There's no God but Allah.
Allah the Almighty.

368
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:21,250
I seek forgiveness from Allah, Ita.
You love Amelia!

369
01:09:21,333 --> 01:09:23,750
I seek forgiveness from Allah, Ita.

370
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:28,541
I seek forgiveness from Allah, Ita.

371
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:29,875
-Be strong, Ita.
-Leave her body!

372
01:09:33,875 --> 01:09:36,791
-Oh, God.
-Oh, my God.

373
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:50,791
Thank you, Abah.

374
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:54,458
We are forever in your debt.

375
01:09:55,375 --> 01:10:00,458
The most important thing is
you have to forgive Asih, all of you.

376
01:10:06,458 --> 01:10:08,333
What about the comb?

377
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:15,041
Stick it in the ground
under the big tree over there.

378
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,625
I should go.

379
01:10:24,041 --> 01:10:27,125
-Peace be upon you.
-And upon you, peace.

380
01:11:00,791 --> 01:11:03,125
May you rest in peace.

381
01:11:55,708 --> 01:12:00,541
37 YEARS LATER

382
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:27,875
Let's play under the tree.

383
01:12:40,458 --> 01:12:41,958
What is that?

384
01:12:42,416 --> 01:12:43,416
Stay here.
