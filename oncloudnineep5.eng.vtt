00:00:05.194 --> 00:00:11.459
If each follower is equal to 1 light year, these people can take you across the Milky Way.

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you for every light year that brings us to our dream destination.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.140
Do you feel better?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.260
Hmm...

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.820
Mork...

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.380
Who?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.900
Pardon?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.480
Whose name?

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.140
It's...

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.260
It's...

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.260
Don't you remember?

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.940
Don't you really remember?

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.740
If you're good to me...

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.300
because you think that I'm Mork,

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:53.220
I have to say thank you.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.420
Mork!

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.520
Mork...

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.980
I always understand that...

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.060
you can remember me.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.540
This is the second time that you walk away from me!

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.020
Didn't I love you enough?

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.060
Why me?

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.060
I'm always the one who is disappointed in love.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.460
I'm sorry.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.100
I'm sorry that I didn't tell you...

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.020
At first, I was so angry.

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.580
But now I understand.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.740
It's difficult for you to tell me.

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:13.860
Because you're afraid that I would be sad.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.260
Mork...

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.100
I like you.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.700
I think...

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.700
I'm too young...

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.700
to love someone.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.780
The relationship that can't go on

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:33.740
or can't stop loving...

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.420
is too cruel.

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:49.140
Please don't think that just only you who are heartbroken.

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.980
You know what...

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.740
The worst thing is that

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:03.740
you're always by my side...

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.900
but I still feel so lonely...

00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:16.180
I want to accept your love...

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:18.180
without embarrassing anyone.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.860
Do you understand?

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.420
I don't know what kind of feeling I'm feeling right now.

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.780
I can't be falling in love with anyone...

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.740
I still don't understand what I'm feeling for you...

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.620
I think I don't understand myself.

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.180
If you say that you can't be falling in love with anyone...

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.540
Can I beg you one thing?

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.180
Let me love you as you are...

00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:06.660
Please...

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.380
You think that our relationship right now...

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.740
is not so clear?

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:38.500
I think we shouldn't fight.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:43.980
It's awful to be far away from you.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.020
I promise...

00:08:54.700 --> 00:08:56.700
I'm going to come back here to give you my answer.

00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:26.620
Please listen carefully...

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:32.620
I'll be right here waiting for you and your answer...

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.140
until you come back.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.460
You're loser again.

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.780
If you think of me, 

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.780
I'll be there for you.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:44.380
Dew is caused by water vapor or moisture in the air that clumps together to form water droplets and then falls to the ground.

00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:51.340
Dew occurs at night during the low air temperature.

00:11:51.340 --> 00:12:04.500
However, the dew that arises on this tree of souls is different. It is formed from the blessings of those we love gathered into the first dew of winter.

00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:15.180
For the first 3-4 days, the spirits will go to the places where they used to be happy.

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:23.300
During this period, these spirits are weak and lose their memory except they drink the first dew of winter.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:32.140
Moreover, the first dew of winter can energize those spirits for up to 99 days.

00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:38.940
During 99 days, you have to come and get the first dew of winter from me before midnight.

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.740
Let's go inside.

00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:25.740
P'Mek...

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:27.740
Hello...

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.380
P'Mek...

00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.380
P'Mek...

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:39.500
Where is P'Mek?

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.740
I want to meet and talk to him.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.740
Let's go somewhere else.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:47.860
Just a moment.

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.860
Where are you going?

00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:51.860
I'm going back home.

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.860
I don't think so.

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.020
If you go back home right now, you still can't enter your house.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.020
Why? It's not so far.

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.020
Please believe what I say.

00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.060
Let's hang out, please...

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.660
Up to you.

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.700
Thanks. Let's go!

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.100
I think white clothes are perfect for you.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.540
Mork, Mork...

00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.380
Excuse me

00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:03.860
Yes?

00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:05.860
Where are you going?

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.860
I'm looking for my brother.

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.660
It seems like the cafe is closing now. I think he's going back home.

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.660
Can I help you?

00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:18.020
It's not the right time to go back home.

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.020
Why not?

00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:29.780
In this world, everything happens for a reason.

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:39.780
Who are you?

00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:44.580
I'm trusting and wondering...

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:51.100
I'm monitoring and controlling...

00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.100
Huh?

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.100
Are you acting like an angel?

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.620
I don't believe you.

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.620
Apparently, you're surrounded by weird things, aren't you?

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.220
Mon is still here.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:22.220
Wait...

00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:25.900
You can't go inside

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:30.020
until you have to promise me.

00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:38.380
If you go inside, you have to come back before midnight.

00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.220
What crazy are you saying?

00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:43.220
Stop asking, just listening!

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.940
You don't have so much time.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.860
You're going to meet that person for the last time.

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.060
He doesn't have a chance to see you again.

00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:09.700
He's in another world. His world is different from ours.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:16.900
What?

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.900
Mon...

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:31.460
I'm going to let that person meet you for the last time.

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.500
It's your time now.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.780
Don't forget what I told you.

00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.380
Come back here before midnight.

00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:41.780
Mon...

00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:59.100
I'm Mork. You're Mon.

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.500
I'm Mork.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:11.900
You're loser.

00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.700
Hmm. Yes, I am.

00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.220
You like the stranger game, don't you?

00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:41.460
How many years

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.820
that I'm Mork playing as Mon,

00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.860
and you're Mon playing as Mork?

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:00.740
I don't know.

00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:02.740
Why?

00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:04.740
Do you want to play again?

00:20:21.820 --> 00:20:23.820
No, I don't.

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.980
What's up, P'Mon?

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.180
How are you?

00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:42.980
I'm sorry...

00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:46.980
that I ask you to play this crazy game.

00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:56.060
If we did not play this game, you would not be apart.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.980
It's also my fault.

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.980
Don't blame yourself.

00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:24.020
It's been 3 years since you left home.

00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.660
I've not been in relationship with P'Tiew.

00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:34.340
I know P'Tiew likes you so much.

00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:47.180
I just want to end this by two of you.

00:21:57.940 --> 00:21:59.940
So we understand, right?

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:11.180
From now on, you don't have to worry about me.

00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.380
I forgive you for everything.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:51.500
What makes me most happy is that the two of us were born together.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:32.100
