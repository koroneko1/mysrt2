1
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,253
I don't know. It's just so weird.

2
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,420
Okay, well, what did he say, exactly?

3
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:57,156
He said he needed to talk to me.

4
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:58,557
- Needed or wanted? - What's the difference?

5
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,858
- Urgency. - He said needed.

6
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:01,426
- Ugh, that's urgent. - I know.

7
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,595
He gave you super gonorrhea.

8
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:04,796
Shut up!

9
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:06,297
When did he tell you this?

10
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:07,799
- As soon as he walked through the door. - Oh, my God.

11
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,368
What an asshole. Do you wanna go?

12
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,470
Yes, and no. I don't want to know what it is.

13
00:01:11,472 --> 00:01:13,372
- Oh, my God. You've got to find out. - You've got to know.

14
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:14,773
- Let's get the check. - Sorry, uh...

15
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,175
Sorry it took me so long.

16
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:19,378
It's so weird. They have one of those toilets

17
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,913
that's like a jacuzzi for your butt.

18
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,418
Well, Japanese culture is so interesting, is it not?

19
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,353
Like, ugh, I can't wait to go to Tokyo.

20
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:31,223
Excuse me?

21
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:35,394
Hey, you're still airbnb-ing the house upstate, right?

22
00:01:35,396 --> 00:01:37,162
- Good God, no! - He didn't tell you?

23
00:01:37,164 --> 00:01:38,930
- No. - Oh, my God, it was a nightmare!

24
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:40,699
This sweet lady, she rents it for the weekend and she brings her dog.

25
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,668
I'm cool with pets. Whatever, it's fine.

26
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,604
Until she decides that she wants to be nice

27
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:46,872
and clean it herself.

28
00:01:46,874 --> 00:01:48,540
It is so not funny.

29
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:50,676
Okay, so, Adam's got one of those robot vacuums.

30
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:52,211
- A Roomba. - A Roomba, yeah.

31
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:53,461
Yeah, Roombas.

32
00:01:53,463 --> 00:01:54,712
She turns the Roomba on, she leaves the house,

33
00:01:54,715 --> 00:01:56,415
and the dog gets into the trash

34
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,983
and eats something that gives him diarrhea.

35
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,684
Un-uh.

36
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,386
And the Roomba spread shit everywhere.

37
00:02:01,388 --> 00:02:03,789
She was gone for eight hours. It took two weeks to clean it up.

38
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,991
- No, no, honey, that is like... - Yes.

39
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:07,392
...the worst thing I've heard all week.

40
00:02:07,394 --> 00:02:08,794
Mm-hmm. - You have a lot of property.

41
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:15,367
And you own it with your ex, right?

42
00:02:15,369 --> 00:02:17,836
Well, no, I actually got it when my mom died.

43
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:19,938
It was always just mine, I guess.

44
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,540
So much property.

45
00:02:25,746 --> 00:02:27,746
And it's so cute, by the way. It's so charming.

46
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:30,015
- It's a safety net house. - No.

47
00:02:30,017 --> 00:02:31,850
- You have to sell it. - Trying to.

48
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:32,951
Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:35,887
- Anyway... - So much property.

50
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:37,489
Can I interest you in dessert?

51
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:38,757
No.

52
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:41,325
Thank you, just the check.

53
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,894
I don't mean to bother you, but I'm obsessed with your website.

54
00:02:43,897 --> 00:02:45,330
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

55
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,566
Oh, stop. This is our anniversary dinner,

56
00:02:47,568 --> 00:02:48,834
so Marklin and I would like to treat you.

57
00:02:48,836 --> 00:02:50,335
- You don't have to do that. - Yes!

58
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:51,837
- We invited you. - You're sure?

59
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:53,571
Yes.

60
00:02:53,573 --> 00:02:55,306
Adam and I are going to hang for a second and finish our fight.

61
00:02:55,309 --> 00:02:56,541
- Really? - No.

62
00:02:56,543 --> 00:02:58,343
Not really. We're gonna walk you guys out.

63
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,879
Can you wrap this up to go?

64
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:03,015
Um, sure.

65
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,352
Those too.

66
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,858
That one too.

67
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,365
Call me and let me know what's up.

68
00:03:20,367 --> 00:03:21,600
Mm-hmm.

69
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:26,505
The waiter ordered us an UberPool.

70
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:28,473
- That's cool, right? - Yes.

71
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,979
Hey!

72
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,948
Wish me luck.

73
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,483
And it just gets worse.

74
00:03:38,485 --> 00:03:40,018
I have my phone on.

75
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:49,328
Now, she really knows how to pick 'em.

76
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:50,529
I need a drink.

77
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:52,898
Oh, well, lucky for you...

78
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,499
- You did not. - Well, yeah.

79
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,801
They took everything else. Why not?

80
00:03:55,803 --> 00:03:57,369
You're gonna get us arrested.

81
00:03:57,371 --> 00:04:00,038
It looks like a bottle of Sprite. Don't worry.

82
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,506
Little bit of worry is okay.

83
00:04:02,508 --> 00:04:03,974
Well, yeah, but that's why I love you.

84
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:06,745
I love you. Happy Anniversary.

85
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:09,848
Maybe next time no double-date?

86
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,084
Hi! Do you have a minute for gay rights?

87
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:15,053
- No! - Okay, asshole.

88
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,589
Easy. We're already members.

89
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:20,559
Oh, my God!

90
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:23,061
I love you.

91
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:25,564
- Can I take a pic? - No problem.

92
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:30,902
Up!

93
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,574
- Thank you. - Okay.

94
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,777
I am freaking out.

95
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:41,913
Didn't know they work nights.

96
00:04:41,915 --> 00:04:43,148
Well, we are downtown.

97
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:45,984
Hey, can I ask you something?

98
00:04:47,688 --> 00:04:49,955
Are you...

99
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:54,926
Let's go.

100
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:56,962
Yes.

101
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,997
Ah, man!

102
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:02,501
I just... I don't know how to tell you this.

103
00:05:02,503 --> 00:05:04,136
Just say it, I guess? I mean...

104
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,805
Uh, okay.

105
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:11,543
Um, look, um... These past three weeks,

106
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:13,528
getting to know you have been amazing

107
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:15,514
and I really think that I'm starting to feel things for you,

108
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:17,783
but there's something that I... Ugh!

109
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:20,585
Oh, my God, you're making me nervous right now!

110
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:22,854
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

111
00:05:22,856 --> 00:05:24,923
- Just say it. - I'm so sorry!

112
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:27,025
- Yeah, I'm... - It's okay.

113
00:05:27,027 --> 00:05:28,460
I'm...

114
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:32,864
I'm homeless.

115
00:05:34,468 --> 00:05:35,834
I'm sorry, what now?

116
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,752
I'm homeless.

117
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,671
- And you're staying on friends' couches? - No, I did that.

118
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,006
You moved in with your parents?

119
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,107
No, I did that too.

120
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,575
I'm...

121
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,845
I live in a shelter.

122
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:49,514
But you have such nice shoes.

123
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,583
I have a locker.

124
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:34,592
Don't eat those.

125
00:06:34,594 --> 00:06:36,694
Come on. Can't we just have coffee like normal people?

126
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:37,829
When I'm done.

127
00:06:38,565 --> 00:06:40,232
Bingo. Bingo.

128
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:41,566
Okay, can you help?

129
00:06:41,568 --> 00:06:43,602
I can't get the shot.

130
00:06:43,604 --> 00:06:45,904
- I'm worried. - Just... Do you mind?

131
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:47,806
Nope.

132
00:06:47,808 --> 00:06:49,074
Okay.

133
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,209
Make sure you get the logo on the...

134
00:06:51,211 --> 00:06:52,577
- I got it. - Okay.

135
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:01,753
What are you doing? Don't make that face.

136
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:03,755
Just look normal, okay?

137
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,290
This is normal.

138
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:06,958
- Don't eat my blackberry. - It's too late.

139
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,934
This normal enough?

140
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,536
You told him get out, right?

141
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:19,804
- Well, I... - You did not have sex with him.

142
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:21,606
- Well, he was already there. - Cammy!

143
00:07:21,608 --> 00:07:22,807
And I already slept with him!

144
00:07:22,809 --> 00:07:25,544
With the presumption that he had shelter!

145
00:07:25,546 --> 00:07:28,146
You know, there should probably be an app for that.

146
00:07:28,148 --> 00:07:30,916
I think it's just assumed. Oh, my God!

147
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:32,284
You slept with a homeless.

148
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:35,587
Person, sweetie.

149
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,255
I slept with a homeless person, okay?

150
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:39,658
- Homeless is not a noun. - A person, of course.

151
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,927
Wow, you are so kind, Cam.

152
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,929
I am really scraping the bottom of the barrel these days.

153
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,631
No, it's good. You gave to someone in need.

154
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,834
- Oh! - Oh, my God, this is so hot!

155
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:52,270
- Eww! - Did they heat this on the sun?

156
00:07:52,272 --> 00:07:54,139
- I'm sorry, that was my fault. - It is so hot!

157
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:57,976
I told them, "Caldo," which is Italian for hot.

158
00:07:57,978 --> 00:08:01,246
- So, you're gonna see him again? - No! Of course not.

159
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:04,749
- Okay, I didn't know! - I have a little self-respect, sweetie.

160
00:08:04,751 --> 00:08:06,885
- All right. - I did it again, okay?

161
00:08:06,887 --> 00:08:08,820
I picked another loser.

162
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:13,058
I'm sorry, but like, what white guy is homeless at 36?

163
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:15,327
- I'm sure there are a lot. - On Tinder?

164
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,195
Yes, that is an interesting twist.

165
00:08:17,197 --> 00:08:21,066
God, he was just so nice, he was just so sweet.

166
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,835
I was really hoping this would work out, you know?

167
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:26,905
How did he get homeless? Get homeless? Become homeless?

168
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:28,373
Wait, what's the right phrase?

169
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,308
It's "become." How do you not know that?

170
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,676
Become homeless.

171
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,045
Well, his ex-girlfriend used to pay for everything and he was staying with her,

172
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,881
and they broke up, so he had to leave.

173
00:08:36,883 --> 00:08:39,217
And he just stayed on friends' couches

174
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,852
until that became untenable.

175
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,221
And then he just checked himself into a shelter?

176
00:08:43,223 --> 00:08:45,390
There are few steps that are missing.

177
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:47,692
I feel like you don't just go from a couch to a shelter.

178
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,862
Yeah, okay! Haley, I get it, but that's what he told me, okay?

179
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,865
I think the red flag was him being supported by the girlfriend.

180
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,201
There are a lot of red flags. Red flags everywhere.

181
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:59,638
I'm color blind. Anyways, how are you?

182
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:02,273
I'm good. I mean, I've got a roof over my head.

183
00:09:04,111 --> 00:09:07,212
- Too soon? - Yes, bitch. That is too soon.

184
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:10,882
I don't know. What do you think so far?

185
00:09:12,686 --> 00:09:14,653
- Looks good to me. - Yeah?

186
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:16,087
Ravella wants it by Friday.

187
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:18,990
Then tell her to paint it her fucking self.

188
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,825
And seriously, it doesn't seem that hard.

189
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,728
How much does one of these go for?

190
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,230
I don't know, like a hundred.

191
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:26,798
- Thousand? - Yeah.

192
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,267
Holy shit!

193
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:32,037
Why don't you just paint one and keep it for yourself

194
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,988
and then you sell it?

195
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,940
Well, because, then it would be by me, not by Ravella.

196
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:38,009
- Yeah, but, they're all by you. - Unofficially.

197
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:39,210
Mm.

198
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,979
So fucked up. It's so fucked up.

199
00:09:41,981 --> 00:09:44,749
These poor bastards who buy this shit. Do they understand

200
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:49,888
that Ravella Brewer is not actually painting their $100,000 treasure?

201
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,956
Well, no, but Ravella is not the first to do this.

202
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,424
Rembrandt, Matisse.

203
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:54,893
I guess, but it's just that she makes a ton of dough

204
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,195
and you, you barely make a living wage.

205
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,997
Yeah, well, it is what it is.

206
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:01,232
Well, if you and Marklin would just get married.

207
00:10:01,234 --> 00:10:03,702
Mm, I'm not taking his money, Elizabeth.

208
00:10:03,704 --> 00:10:05,904
It's not taking money when you're married, it's called sharing.

209
00:10:05,906 --> 00:10:08,707
That is marriage. I mean, why are you so against it?

210
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,276
I marched my ass in the snow for your rights.

211
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,279
I don't know, the thing about gay marriage...

212
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,014
No, no, no, no. Don't say it.

213
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:18,483
- It's so gay. - It's not funny. You're deflecting.

214
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:20,117
It's not even on the table.

215
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,752
It's because you're so vocal about how you don't want to do it.

216
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:23,254
And what? And end up like Haley? No, thank you.

217
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:25,156
Not everyone gets divorced after a year.

218
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,158
Yeah, some people last five, like my parents.

219
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,929
Damon and I got engaged the first week we met.

220
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:33,932
And look at us, still together 15 years later.

221
00:10:33,934 --> 00:10:36,401
Come on, look at it. He put the ring in a bagel.

222
00:10:36,403 --> 00:10:37,802
- Yes. - French!

223
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,137
You are insane.

224
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,106
- Ah! - Look, I love being gay.

225
00:10:41,108 --> 00:10:43,108
You know that. It's probably like my favorite thing about myself.

226
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:45,443
I love that you're gay.

227
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,779
But, I don't know. Marriage doesn't magically solve...

228
00:10:49,883 --> 00:10:51,398
Two men together is tricky.

229
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,916
Okay, then don't get married. Just share his money

230
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:55,053
like Damon and I do. Come on, I do better than him,

231
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:58,456
but it's doesn't matter. You're in a partnership, for God's sake!

232
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:00,792
Ba-ba-bup-bup. Let's drop it.

233
00:11:00,794 --> 00:11:02,527
Okay? I got to finish this by Friday.

234
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,832
Blobs.

235
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,935
It's so simple!

236
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,337
Seriously, I could do that.

237
00:11:12,339 --> 00:11:14,372
You know, it's a little more complicated than that.

238
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,341
- Well... - Give it a try.

239
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:19,626
- Really? - Yeah.

240
00:11:19,628 --> 00:11:21,845
I mean, as long as she signs it, it's a Ravella Brewer.

241
00:11:22,549 --> 00:11:23,848
Just don't go nuts.

242
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,019
Don't go nuts.

243
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,420
- Okay, no crazy. - Oh, yeah.

244
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:31,890
- Crazy. - I know you.

245
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,124
Where shall I begin?

246
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:34,325
Maybe over here.

247
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:38,729
Feels good, right?

248
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,965
Ah, I'd feel a lot better if I was getting paid a hundred grand.

249
00:11:42,235 --> 00:11:43,501
I'm out of mud.

250
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,170
- Let me? - Excuse me.

251
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,975
- Boom! - Damn, that's good.

252
00:11:50,977 --> 00:11:52,277
Don't even need to sand.

253
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:54,479
Work for me?

254
00:11:54,481 --> 00:11:57,215
That would be a fun life pivot.

255
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,317
- What's this gonna be again? - An office for Elizabeth.

256
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,453
I've given up on trying to make it a nursery.

257
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,588
Oh, well.

258
00:12:04,524 --> 00:12:05,989
Sorry.

259
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:07,457
You kind of missed the boat on that one.

260
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:09,027
This will be nice, though.

261
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,029
Elizabeth thinks she hates kids.

262
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,398
Um, she does hate kids.

263
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:17,602
I kept thinking I could convince her, you know?

264
00:12:17,604 --> 00:12:20,171
Should have switched her birth control out with Tic Tacs.

265
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:23,041
- Wait, they look the same? - Mm-hmm. Yeah.

266
00:12:23,043 --> 00:12:26,277
- Really? - No!

267
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:28,513
You can't trick someone into having a baby.

268
00:12:28,515 --> 00:12:31,115
Especially her. She'll jump in front of a train if that happened.

269
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,285
Uh, I feel like that's what's missing.

270
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,021
Oh, sure. Baby fixes everything.

271
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:39,157
I need to retape this. You did a shitty job.

272
00:12:41,361 --> 00:12:43,862
So, when are you two gonna have one?

273
00:12:44,631 --> 00:12:45,997
What?

274
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,133
Mm, never.

275
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:51,936
Ah, come on. You'd make great dads.

276
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,906
I don't feel like dropping $250,000 to buy a baby.

277
00:12:54,908 --> 00:12:56,574
- Shit! That's a lot. - Yeah.

278
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:58,509
And IVF lawyers.

279
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,312
Taking care of some needy fucking surrogate in Albuquerque.

280
00:13:01,314 --> 00:13:03,113
It's at least that.

281
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,915
- Well, you could adopt. - I already have a baby.

282
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,951
And his name is Adam.

283
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:10,655
- There you go. - And he's a baby.

284
00:13:10,657 --> 00:13:12,590
Ooh! Over here, over here.

285
00:13:12,592 --> 00:13:15,360
The Whitney I love. The Whitney free Wi-Fi.

286
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:17,662
- Uh-huh. - I swear, someone's siphoning my data.

287
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,597
Who keeps texting you?

288
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:21,266
It's just one of my students.

289
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:23,001
They're very persistent.

290
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:24,302
Well, it's mid-terms.

291
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,371
Is that Scott James?

292
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:29,940
No. Yeah, yes.

293
00:13:29,942 --> 00:13:32,576
You are moving into some very serious Pamela Smart territory right now.

294
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,412
He just needs help with his homework.

295
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:36,114
I think he wants a little bit more than that.

296
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,016
No.

297
00:13:38,018 --> 00:13:40,418
Are you serious? He is so dependent on you.

298
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,953
Well, you know, maybe a little.

299
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:44,122
Little? You wrote all of his college essays.

300
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:46,224
Well, it's just easier than all the back and forth.

301
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,127
- He has a boner for you, Haley. - He's 17.

302
00:13:49,129 --> 00:13:50,528
Well, at least he has a home.

303
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,397
Do you mind if I... I'm just gonna grab this.

304
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,432
- Yeah. - Hello?

305
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:36,341
Who doesn't know that Mark Twain coined the term "the Gilded Age?"

306
00:14:36,343 --> 00:14:38,343
- Everybody. - It's like...

307
00:14:38,345 --> 00:14:40,712
I like to feel like I'm making a difference by tutoring these kids,

308
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:42,663
but then I get a call like that.

309
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,615
Well, at least you have a reason to get out of bed in the morning.

310
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:49,187
Sometimes I feel like the darkness is just gonna consume me.

311
00:14:49,189 --> 00:14:51,756
- You're being dramatic. - I fucked a homeless person.

312
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,624
No, yeah, that's dark.

313
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,728
But that's behind you now.

314
00:15:07,107 --> 00:15:08,506
No, stop. I got to work.

315
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:37,368
Hey.

316
00:15:38,071 --> 00:15:39,337
Hey! Psst!

317
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:48,379
Very funny.

318
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,251
- That always gets me. - Hey there.

319
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:54,719
Hi.

320
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,055
One sec. Yup.

321
00:15:57,057 --> 00:15:59,090
- Delivery. - Thanks. Just a minute.

322
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,662
- Gotta answer the door. - Nuh-uh.

323
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:06,330
- I'm just kissing you. - Yeah.

324
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,632
You're never just kissing me.

325
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,501
I can't help it if I'm attracted to my boyfriend.

326
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:12,170
We have sex every day.

327
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:14,138
That's a bad thing?

328
00:16:24,184 --> 00:16:25,249
Here we go.

329
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,663
Don't do that.

330
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:41,466
We were having fun. Don't shut down. I just have a lot of stuff to post today.

331
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,700
I'm not shut down.

332
00:16:44,704 --> 00:16:47,605
And by the way, we don't have sex everyday.

333
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,708
We used to.

334
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,145
Sometimes, I just want affection.

335
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:56,147
Are you fucking kidding me?

336
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,648
Just telling you how I feel.

337
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:00,785
No, not you, the coat. It's $14,000.

338
00:17:02,322 --> 00:17:04,054
I don't know. Sure.

339
00:17:04,056 --> 00:17:05,789
That's like my first semester of art school.

340
00:17:05,792 --> 00:17:08,459
God, so much free shit.

341
00:17:09,262 --> 00:17:10,561
It's not free.

342
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:12,163
We'll give him at least that in promotion.

343
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:15,566
Yeah, well, it's just... I mean, come on. It's crazy.

344
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,702
You gotta admit, when you don't need it, you get it,

345
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,871
and then when you need it, you don't get it.

346
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,672
Mm-hmm.

347
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,145
You know, I could take some of those if you want.

348
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:28,312
No, I'm good, I got it.

349
00:17:30,617 --> 00:17:32,683
Okay.

350
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,585
All right. I'm gonna get out of your hair, then.

351
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:42,326
Oh, hey, um, I'm gonna be like, a day or two late on the rent this month.

352
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:43,794
Ravella's accountant is out of town and...

353
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:46,664
- Already covered it. - Oh, okay. Thank you.

354
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:49,901
I'll have it tomorrow, next day at the latest.

355
00:17:49,903 --> 00:17:51,835
It's just, you know, the house upstate...

356
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,770
It's fine, I don't mind covering the rent. I already told you that.

357
00:17:55,842 --> 00:17:57,175
You will sell the house.

358
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,377
Someday, okay?

359
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,607
Hey, I'm headed to the studio.

360
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,409
You want to grab some food later?

361
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:33,578
Uh, I'm supposed to be meeting Cammy tonight.

362
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,814
Okay. Tell her I said hi.

363
00:18:37,383 --> 00:18:38,616
Okay.

364
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,784
- Love you. - Love you too.

365
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,440
I thought the deal was you were going to write some of this out longhand.

366
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,542
Turn your phone off.

367
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,777
I have terrible handwriting.

368
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:09,013
Well, that's because no one writes anymore.

369
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:11,015
The Palmer Method is a lost art.

370
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:14,167
You're so smart.

371
00:19:14,169 --> 00:19:15,952
You are just as smart. It's about applying yourself.

372
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:24,829
I...

373
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,632
I didn't get into Brown.

374
00:19:30,036 --> 00:19:32,003
Oh, no! Really?

375
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:34,338
Yeah, see? I'm not as smart as you.

376
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,407
I couldn't even get into the place you went.

377
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,058
That was a long time ago.

378
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,710
Well, I mean, it wasn't that long ago.

379
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:40,845
Wait, ow!

380
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,047
How is that even possible?

381
00:19:44,284 --> 00:19:45,449
That was a great essay.

382
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,352
I sent in my version.

383
00:19:48,855 --> 00:19:50,421
What now?

384
00:19:50,423 --> 00:19:51,956
I didn't use the one you fixed.

385
00:19:53,326 --> 00:19:54,659
Why would you do that?

386
00:19:54,661 --> 00:19:56,527
Because you wrote it.

387
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:59,830
No, I merely corrected it

388
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:02,700
and made it more cohesive.

389
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,068
You wrote it, Haley, not me.

390
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:06,871
What?

391
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:10,675
You let me fix everything, Scott James!

392
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:13,060
What am I doing right now?

393
00:20:13,062 --> 00:20:15,446
And you choose to take a stand with the most important assignment ever,

394
00:20:15,448 --> 00:20:16,781
your college essay?

395
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:18,916
Don't be mad. It wasn't a stand.

396
00:20:18,918 --> 00:20:20,518
I'm not mad, I'm...

397
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,891
All the work we've done together...

398
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,826
- You've done. - We've done.

399
00:20:28,828 --> 00:20:30,828
I have sat there holding your hand,

400
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,630
ushering you along all this while.

401
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:39,503
I just wanted to see if I could do it on my own.

402
00:20:39,505 --> 00:20:40,738
Well, clearly, you cannot!

403
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:43,507
I already knew that.

404
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:45,476
Why do you think your parents are paying me all this money

405
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,877
to come over here four times a week?

406
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,847
Shit, I'm sorry.

407
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:53,884
Oh, no. No, Scott James. I am sorry. I am sorry.

408
00:20:53,886 --> 00:20:56,354
I shouldn't have lost my temper like that.

409
00:20:56,356 --> 00:21:00,558
You are so smart, Scott James, so smart.

410
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,059
No, I'm just a dum-dum.

411
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:03,794
No, no, no, you are not.

412
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,737
No, no, Scott James!

413
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,574
No, no, no, it's okay. It's okay.

414
00:21:16,576 --> 00:21:18,409
It'll make me feel better.

415
00:21:18,411 --> 00:21:20,778
No. Come on, now.

416
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,646
It's... It's okay.

417
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:36,427
Oh, wow. That looks amazing.

418
00:21:36,429 --> 00:21:38,629
- Thank you. - How did you do that?

419
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:41,632
Um, I used to edit cookbooks, so it's not really a big deal.

420
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:43,768
Wow, I have, like, so much more. You don't have to...

421
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,386
No, it's... I'm sorry.

422
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:49,005
We just don't usually get this kind of food at the shelter.

423
00:21:49,008 --> 00:21:52,576
And this... This is amazing.

424
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:53,878
This tastes so good.

425
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,112
- Thank you. - Yeah.

426
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,819
My tongue feels weird.

427
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,654
Oh, there's some Szechuan peppers in there.

428
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:05,022
It's like it's buzzing.

429
00:22:05,024 --> 00:22:07,158
Um, is it going to burn me?

430
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,762
Mm-mm. It's not hot as much as it can cause neurological confusion.

431
00:22:11,764 --> 00:22:13,663
Okay. What?

432
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,565
It's really cool. Just, like, confuses your taste buds.

433
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:17,134
So, it's not gonna fuck with my head?

434
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,970
No, no. Mm-mm.

435
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:21,071
Okay.

436
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,676
- Oh, that tastes weird. - Yeah, it's the peppers.

437
00:22:25,678 --> 00:22:27,211
- I just said... - I think I'm gonna take a break.

438
00:22:27,213 --> 00:22:28,746
Yeah, me too.

439
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,183
So, I was actually thinking

440
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:34,485
of having one of my girls come over tonight.

441
00:22:34,487 --> 00:22:35,553
Nice, what do you wanna do?

442
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,790
Well, we were gonna stay here.

443
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:42,860
Oh, that's cool. There are so many killer docs on Netflix right now.

444
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,462
Yeah, they are the killer.

445
00:22:44,464 --> 00:22:47,097
I have been catching up on so much great stuff

446
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:50,133
since you've been letting me stay here.

447
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,170
I mean, at the shelter, it's Forensic Files all day, everyday.

448
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:55,639
- Sucks. - Well, I was just kinda hoping

449
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,641
we can have, like, one-on-one girl time.

450
00:22:57,643 --> 00:22:59,610
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, no.

451
00:22:59,612 --> 00:23:01,812
Of course. I know how to do a lockout.

452
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,981
Um, what's a good time for me to come back?

453
00:23:03,983 --> 00:23:05,983
Like, midnight, one o'clock?

454
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,051
Well, where are you gonna go?

455
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:10,120
Well, there's plenty of places to hand. I can go to the library,

456
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:12,156
go to Starbucks, I can take the A-train

457
00:23:12,158 --> 00:23:13,858
out to Far Rockaway,

458
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:16,627
and then up to 207th.

459
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:19,029
And back out to Far Rockaway.

460
00:23:20,199 --> 00:23:22,566
You think I'm still neurologically confused?

461
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:24,101
- Yeah, I don't... - Fuck it, I'm hungry.

462
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,171
Fuck it.

463
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,596
- Hi. - Hi.

464
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:58,269
Thank you.

465
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,142
- Hello. - Hi.

466
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,011
He's having a really good day today.

467
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,946
- Oh, yeah? - Yeah.

468
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,981
I've seen cases worse than this turn around.

469
00:24:14,053 --> 00:24:15,252
You don't have to do that.

470
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:16,887
Do what?

471
00:24:18,591 --> 00:24:19,757
I know what the deal is.

472
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,061
He can hear you, you know?

473
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:25,829
That's fine. He knows what the deal is too.

474
00:24:27,266 --> 00:24:28,632
Okay.

475
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,320
Right.

476
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,163
- Yeah? - Oh, finally. You answer.

477
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:07,547
What's wrong? What's going on?

478
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:08,932
Have you see The Detailist today?

479
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:11,335
Marklin looks like the truest form of a Kennedy.

480
00:26:11,337 --> 00:26:13,671
I get why people buy so much stuff because of him.

481
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:15,072
Is this why you called?

482
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:17,041
He's so handsome.

483
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,910
I mean, if he got a flat tire, people would know who he was.

484
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:22,012
Okay, people already know who he is.

485
00:26:22,014 --> 00:26:23,147
So weird, right?

486
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,682
One minute we're all working at CB2,

487
00:26:24,684 --> 00:26:25,883
the next minute he's famous.

488
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:27,951
We live in New York. He doesn't drive.

489
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,121
You know what I mean. He's that type of person.

490
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:33,223
I got wine for tonight. What time do you want me to come over?

491
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:36,093
And is anyone else coming? Also, I could make a pizza.

492
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,962
If you're eating that. Are you still doing points?

493
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:40,764
I could do a cauliflower crust.

494
00:26:40,766 --> 00:26:42,966
Uh, yes, I'm still doing points.

495
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:44,368
And I really want to go out tonight.

496
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,070
Cam, you said we were gonna watch

497
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:48,205
the Menendez Brothers anniversary thing.

498
00:26:48,207 --> 00:26:51,041
It's the only thing that's kept me breathing this horrible week.

499
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:53,343
Well, I'll DVR it. I just really need to get out.

500
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:55,179
You sound weird. What's going on?

501
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,348
Nothing.

502
00:27:00,453 --> 00:27:03,353
- Are you alone? - Yeah, who would be here?

503
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:05,222
Any number of strange men.

504
00:27:05,224 --> 00:27:08,258
Please, girl. I can't.

505
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:10,160
I'll see you later.

506
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:15,833
God, it's hot out.

507
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:19,236
Do you have any matches?

508
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:22,072
Uh-huh, yeah, somewhere.

509
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:23,741
Lighter on the shelf.

510
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,275
Wait, what do you need it for?

511
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:34,184
Oh, my God. Your birthday's today?

512
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:36,220
Scott James, I'm so sorry. I totally forgot.

513
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:37,321
It's okay.

514
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,290
No, no, wait. You can't just blow it out.

515
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:42,126
Um, happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you.

516
00:27:42,128 --> 00:27:44,128
Happy birthday, dear Scott James. Happy Birthday to you.

517
00:27:52,238 --> 00:27:54,371
- It's official. - What's official?

518
00:27:56,442 --> 00:27:57,908
I'm an adult now.

519
00:28:01,447 --> 00:28:02,546
Cupcake.

520
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,281
Cake.

521
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,917
- What? - What?

522
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:08,118
Today's not your birthday.

523
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,854
Your birthday is on July 11th.

524
00:28:10,856 --> 00:28:13,223
The day that Marie Antoinette said, "Let them eat cake."

525
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:14,925
You actually told me she never said that.

526
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,426
She didn't. That's not the point.

527
00:28:16,428 --> 00:28:19,129
The point is that your birthday is not for another month.

528
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:21,465
Well, what's the big deal? It's only a few weeks. Come on!

529
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,233
Scott James, I am your teacher!

530
00:28:23,235 --> 00:28:25,169
But hey, I love you.

531
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,804
Oh, no! Scott James, don't say that.

532
00:28:26,806 --> 00:28:29,173
But it's true! I can't help it.

533
00:28:29,175 --> 00:28:30,974
I can't stop thinking about you!

534
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:33,944
- But you have to stop. - I can't, Haley, it hurts!

535
00:28:33,946 --> 00:28:36,246
It hurts! It's my heart, Haley, I just...

536
00:28:36,248 --> 00:28:38,382
I just... I don't know what to do!

537
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,117
I am in so much pain.

538
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:42,953
My gosh! Oh, my gosh, you've got a crush.

539
00:28:42,955 --> 00:28:44,922
That's why they call it that. It crushes you.

540
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:48,292
I can't. I can't. I can't go on. I can't go on.

541
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,260
Oh, no. That's not gonna work. It's electric.

542
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:53,130
It doesn't even work.

543
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,932
Don't cry, Scott James.

544
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,547
Uh...

545
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,469
So, we have to stop now.

546
00:29:33,606 --> 00:29:36,006
Thank you, Ken.

547
00:29:36,008 --> 00:29:38,175
Uh, I hate to end a session like that,

548
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,344
but, a lot to think about.

549
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:43,247
- Totally. - Mm-hmm.

550
00:29:43,249 --> 00:29:45,515
So, let me look at some times for next week.

551
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:47,251
Uh, you know what? Can I e-mail you?

552
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:48,652
I have a couple projects up in the air.

553
00:29:48,654 --> 00:29:52,456
- I have a product launch sometime. - Sure.

554
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:55,525
I love what you're doing for men's fashion.

555
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:59,363
I hope it's okay that I speak about something outside this room?

556
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:03,500
- It's all right. - It's fine.

557
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:07,204
And, allow the feelings that came up today to exist.

558
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:11,074
Or not exist, if that's what they're telling you

559
00:30:12,044 --> 00:30:13,243
You can make space for that.

560
00:30:15,347 --> 00:30:16,480
- Sure. - Okay, then.

561
00:30:23,989 --> 00:30:25,222
- Bingo. - Bingo.

562
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,328
- Same route, or different? - Same.

563
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:32,562
I'm going to get some neck massage.

564
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:36,333
- Feet too. - You're on.

565
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,070
Just wait. Don't... Okay.

566
00:30:40,072 --> 00:30:41,705
- You're cheating. - I'm winning.

567
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,107
No. Oh, shit!

568
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:17,240
- Oh, red light. - Hey, you, like me?

569
00:31:17,242 --> 00:31:18,375
Fags!

570
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,077
- Yeah. - Yeah, we are.

571
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,244
Fuck off!

572
00:31:44,386 --> 00:31:46,103
You know, that's like the fifth time we've had that?

573
00:31:46,105 --> 00:31:48,238
I can make something else, we can go out...

574
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,374
No, no, no, no, no, are you kidding me? I love it.

575
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:53,110
Besides, I'm used to eating the same thing every day where I live.

576
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:54,478
And no lockouts.

577
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,381
You are...

578
00:31:58,217 --> 00:32:00,017
- You are the best. - I know.

579
00:32:01,053 --> 00:32:02,702
I am the best.

580
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:04,354
My mouth still does feel a little weird, though.

581
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,571
- Really? - Mm-hmm.

582
00:32:05,573 --> 00:32:06,789
Think you would have built up some tolerance to that already.

583
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,733
Where are you going, Mr. Henry?

584
00:32:16,735 --> 00:32:19,569
Come on, we can't even get through one movie?

585
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,538
Mm-hmm. - I'm just saying.

586
00:32:34,586 --> 00:32:37,054
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

587
00:32:37,056 --> 00:32:38,422
Stop, stop, stop. Henry, stop.

588
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:39,689
Oh, my God.

589
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,224
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

590
00:32:41,226 --> 00:32:43,393
It tastes like I licked a battery. Oh, my God.

591
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:45,429
Oh, my vagina is on fire!

592
00:32:45,431 --> 00:32:47,330
Oh, my God! This is disgusting.

593
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:49,433
Okay, you know what? You don't have to be a dick.

594
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:52,135
Yeah, well, I didn't ask you to fuck up my whole neurological system.

595
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:54,604
It's not your whole system. It's just your taste buds.

596
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:55,955
Yeah, my taste buds,

597
00:32:55,957 --> 00:32:57,307
which are making my favorite thing in the world

598
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,608
taste like a bag of old pennies.

599
00:33:01,346 --> 00:33:02,679
Get out.

600
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:07,384
- What? - Get out.

601
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:09,619
I can see why your ex-girlfriend broke up with you.

602
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:11,421
I can see why you're homeless.

603
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,290
You are just an asshole.

604
00:33:13,292 --> 00:33:15,459
- I'm sorry. - I mean, I cook for you,

605
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,395
I am nice to you, I let you live with me, no lockouts!

606
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:19,496
I know, I know, I know, I know.

607
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,398
I'm really, really sorry. It's just...

608
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,133
I'm really fucked up from these peppers.

609
00:33:24,303 --> 00:33:26,570
No. You're just fucked up, period.

610
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:28,638
You're homeless.

611
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,707
What 36-year-old doesn't even have a couch to sleep on?

612
00:33:30,709 --> 00:33:32,625
I told you why.

613
00:33:32,627 --> 00:33:34,544
And what self-respecting human being sleeps with a homeless person?

614
00:33:34,546 --> 00:33:38,315
I mean, like, yeah, you told me, and I just accepted it?

615
00:33:38,317 --> 00:33:39,516
You have to go.

616
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:44,121
- What, now? - Yes, now.

617
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:46,523
But, I can't check back into the shelter after 2 p.m.

618
00:33:46,525 --> 00:33:48,658
That is not my problem right now, okay?

619
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,429
Cammy, look, look, sit down, please.

620
00:33:52,431 --> 00:33:57,767
Sit down. I am so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, sorry.

621
00:33:57,769 --> 00:34:00,437
I mean, I am... I don't have anywhere else to go.

622
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,305
Where am I supposed to go?

623
00:34:02,307 --> 00:34:03,840
I'm so sorry. Please.

624
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:09,246
Fine. Fine. You can stay tonight.

625
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,514
Thank you. Thank you.

626
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:13,583
- I'm sorry. - Don't stop fanning.

627
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:14,684
Okay.

628
00:34:26,165 --> 00:34:27,831
- Close race. - Not even.

629
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:33,904
Thanks.

630
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:47,484
Sorry about all that.

631
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:50,921
Okay?

632
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:53,423
I don't mean whatever.

633
00:34:53,425 --> 00:34:55,792
I mean, I'm sorry too.

634
00:34:55,794 --> 00:34:58,562
It's just frustrating, this whole couples thing.

635
00:34:59,731 --> 00:35:01,431
I feel like it's pulling us further apart,

636
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,866
than bringing us close together.

637
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:04,301
Yes, that's what hit me too.

638
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:15,979
Can't we just spend the money on dates each week instead?

639
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:18,582
We could.

640
00:35:18,584 --> 00:35:20,817
- Fuck, it's so much money. - Yeah, it is.

641
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,287
Yeah.

642
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:25,855
Dates were never really our problem, though.

643
00:35:27,492 --> 00:35:28,725
It's just...

644
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,462
I don't know. I don't know.

645
00:35:35,701 --> 00:35:36,900
Is that all there is?

646
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,904
I just wish we could go back to the way things were.

647
00:35:41,406 --> 00:35:42,539
Simpler.

648
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:45,976
Was it?

649
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:47,811
You know what I mean.

650
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,015
You want to turn that off?

651
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:54,985
Yeah, let me just check nothing is on fire first.

652
00:35:54,987 --> 00:35:57,621
Nothing's ever on fire.

653
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,422
- This is work. - Are you sure about that?

654
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,892
Why are you getting so worked up?

655
00:36:02,894 --> 00:36:05,795
It's just the constant interruptions. Always.

656
00:36:05,797 --> 00:36:07,831
It's when we're home, when we're out,

657
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,833
you documenting every single moment.

658
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,370
This is work. It's my job.

659
00:36:13,372 --> 00:36:14,671
It's what I work for.

660
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:15,805
Yeah, well...

661
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,346
Wanna come back?

662
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,816
Thought we were connecting here.

663
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:32,856
You owe me a massage.

664
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:50,907
Ooh.

665
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,311
Relax.

666
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,630
Sorry.

667
00:37:13,632 --> 00:37:14,998
Sorry.

668
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,533
Sorry.

669
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,686
Why is it so hard all the time?

670
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:39,889
Five years.

671
00:37:40,492 --> 00:37:41,591
I guess.

672
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:47,364
Some people get married.

673
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:52,769
Or get out.

674
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,372
Shit or get off the pot.

675
00:37:57,008 --> 00:37:58,074
Yeah.

676
00:38:04,649 --> 00:38:05,749
Maybe it's time.

677
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:10,553
For what?

678
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,480
Can't believe it.

679
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:41,518
Almost 15 years.

680
00:38:43,922 --> 00:38:45,688
I feel so numb.

681
00:38:46,858 --> 00:38:48,992
Oh, it's so fucking cliche.

682
00:38:48,994 --> 00:38:50,593
Oh, yeah, he is who he is.

683
00:38:51,096 --> 00:38:52,829
She's young, hot,

684
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,499
of childbearing years, not very smart.

685
00:38:56,501 --> 00:38:59,068
You're sure it's not like a text flirtation?

686
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:01,004
I don't fucking care. It's the same thing.

687
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,873
Okay, come on. I mean, it could be harmless.

688
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:06,843
God knows what comes through Marklin's phone on a daily basis.

689
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:10,814
How that doesn't drive you insane is just, it's beyond me.

690
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,983
It does, but it's different.

691
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:17,369
How is it different?

692
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:18,987
It's not different. What, because you're two men?

693
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,959
I mean, what, there aren't separate gay rules, are there?

694
00:39:22,961 --> 00:39:24,828
There sort of are.

695
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,464
What I mean... Wait, do you want something stronger?

696
00:39:27,466 --> 00:39:28,998
- Yes, please. - Okay.

697
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,635
What I mean is that, you know, men... men are men.

698
00:39:32,637 --> 00:39:35,238
And we separate things easier.

699
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,973
Do you really believe that?

700
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:40,176
I mean, you never get jealous.

701
00:39:40,178 --> 00:39:43,112
Well, of course, I do, but it's like...

702
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:45,782
You know, in context, it's just not a huge deal.

703
00:39:45,784 --> 00:39:48,251
Sex is sex, intimacy is intimacy.

704
00:39:48,253 --> 00:39:50,887
And I don't even believe that.

705
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:52,956
Who the fuck knows?

706
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,892
We're in couple's, so I'm no expert.

707
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:59,596
- Since when? - Ah, since, I don't know.

708
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:01,898
Since we just keep missing each other.

709
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:04,601
You want the name of the guy?

710
00:40:04,603 --> 00:40:05,835
Oh, I'm not going to counseling.

711
00:40:05,837 --> 00:40:08,171
Oh, come on. You can't throw away 15 years.

712
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:11,340
If you guys can't do it, then...

713
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,510
Everything became just very clear when I found out about it.

714
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
When I found out about it, I knew.

715
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:20,283
For a while now, I just...

716
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,219
I chose to ignore it.

717
00:40:25,624 --> 00:40:27,223
I guess you made compromises.

718
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,925
One makes compromises.

719
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:31,794
One chooses to fool oneself.

720
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,100
I mean...

721
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:40,069
You tell your friends, "I'm dating this dingo,

722
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:43,573
but you know, don't worry, he's not too dingoey."

723
00:40:43,575 --> 00:40:46,676
And then you come home one day and he is eating the babies,

724
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:48,278
'cause he's a fucking dingo and that's what dingoes do.

725
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:51,981
They eat the babies.

726
00:40:51,983 --> 00:40:54,617
- And you don't even like kids. - I don't, no.

727
00:40:58,657 --> 00:41:01,257
Finally, Ravella is painting something interesting.

728
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:03,326
Oh, no. That's...

729
00:41:05,297 --> 00:41:06,829
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

730
00:41:07,632 --> 00:41:08,798
Don't turn it around.

731
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:10,667
It's nothing to see, it's...

732
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:13,736
That's yours.

733
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:15,138
Yeah, it's just an idea.

734
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:17,607
It's really good, Adam.

735
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:19,909
Not at all.

736
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:23,246
It's much better than that crap you usually paint for Ravella.

737
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:25,815
Yeah, if only she would sign one of my paintings.

738
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:28,651
You don't need her.

739
00:41:32,791 --> 00:41:33,890
I love it.

740
00:41:41,666 --> 00:41:43,600
I swear that truck is following me.

741
00:41:43,602 --> 00:41:44,734
Just a little further.

742
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,272
- Okay, turn. - What is it?

743
00:41:49,274 --> 00:41:50,640
- Oh. - Sit.

744
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:55,143
I mean...

745
00:41:55,145 --> 00:41:57,145
unless there's a pinata, is the blindfold really necessary?

746
00:41:57,148 --> 00:41:58,381
Yes, shh! Take it off.

747
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,253
Surprise!

748
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,388
What is this?

749
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,094
Nothing.

750
00:42:13,965 --> 00:42:17,200
I just got some things I want to talk with you about.

751
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:25,908
To the man I met on this very bench

752
00:42:26,945 --> 00:42:28,144
five years ago.

753
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:35,418
You have changed my life. I'm very lucky.

754
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,425
- Let's eat. I'm starving. - Yeah.

755
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:57,940
What are you doing?

756
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,677
I'm just making smaller bites.

757
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,211
For the rats?

758
00:43:07,786 --> 00:43:09,819
So?

759
00:43:09,821 --> 00:43:12,088
- Hmm? - You said you had some things you wanted to talk about.

760
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:14,924
Yes.

761
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:22,198
What do you think?

762
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,233
About what?

763
00:43:25,336 --> 00:43:26,469
Living here.

764
00:43:29,274 --> 00:43:31,274
I wanted to talk to you about it first, but,

765
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,342
I already made an offer.

766
00:43:35,747 --> 00:43:37,447
Were we gonna discuss it?

767
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,082
Yeah, we're discussing it now.

768
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,885
They haven't accepted yet.

769
00:43:42,887 --> 00:43:45,321
I just don't think I can really swing buying an apartment

770
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:46,723
at the moment.

771
00:43:48,093 --> 00:43:49,292
It's just, you know...

772
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:54,130
If you got rid of that albatross of a house,

773
00:43:54,132 --> 00:43:56,032
you'll have some money, we'll get out of the basement.

774
00:43:56,034 --> 00:43:57,900
I've been trying to for the last two years.

775
00:43:57,902 --> 00:44:00,269
I know. Two years. I've been very patient.

776
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:02,405
- This is really patient? - And generous.

777
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,140
I seem to remember I was pretty patient and generous

778
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,409
when you were making 12 bucks an hour at CB2.

779
00:44:06,411 --> 00:44:08,277
It's not about the money, Adam.

780
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:10,346
I have plenty of money for both of us if you'd just let me.

781
00:44:11,916 --> 00:44:13,116
It's about us.

782
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:16,519
We don't have kids. It's just us.

783
00:44:20,125 --> 00:44:22,091
I can't believe we're still having these arguments.

784
00:44:22,093 --> 00:44:24,026
We're not in our 20s anymore. It's like...

785
00:44:26,264 --> 00:44:27,764
You know, when we first met,

786
00:44:27,766 --> 00:44:30,867
I had the life that you wanted.

787
00:44:30,869 --> 00:44:33,202
And now, it suddenly feels like

788
00:44:33,204 --> 00:44:34,504
I don't measure up.

789
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:35,838
You do.

790
00:44:40,378 --> 00:44:42,812
Do you know how many artists would kill to paint for Ravella?

791
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:45,915
Hey, I'm so proud of you.

792
00:44:47,485 --> 00:44:50,219
I just want more. You should want more too.

793
00:44:50,221 --> 00:44:51,554
This is when is it supposed to get a little easier.

794
00:44:59,297 --> 00:45:00,997
So much for surprises.

795
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,364
You okay?

796
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,273
Huh, I got it.

797
00:46:28,353 --> 00:46:31,354
Ravella, I am curious to know

798
00:46:31,356 --> 00:46:35,291
who your primary influences are

799
00:46:35,293 --> 00:46:38,961
for this series. They are so bold,

800
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:43,332
yet have a deceptively jejune quality.

801
00:46:43,635 --> 00:46:45,201
Jejune.

802
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,069
Hmm.

803
00:46:47,639 --> 00:46:50,673
Well, that's funny.

804
00:46:50,675 --> 00:46:53,943
Uh, I pull from life.

805
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:59,949
From the myriad connections we encounter every day,

806
00:46:59,951 --> 00:47:02,952
living in this bustling metropolis.

807
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:05,154
She better not say something.

808
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:07,290
It's fine. I don't care.

809
00:47:08,593 --> 00:47:09,692
What is up with you tonight?

810
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,301
We're here. Sorry we're late.

811
00:47:18,303 --> 00:47:20,436
- Our Uber driver was the fucking worst. - Yeah.

812
00:47:20,438 --> 00:47:21,971
I almost got molested by him.

813
00:47:21,973 --> 00:47:23,339
Okay, that did not happen, Haley,

814
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,308
but they are seriously the fucking worst.

815
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,043
They'll let anyone drive those cars.

816
00:47:27,045 --> 00:47:29,478
But anyways, we're here. I need a cigarette.

817
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,579
- Haley. - Yeah.

818
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:32,615
Come on, I need my medicine.

819
00:47:32,617 --> 00:47:35,351
I might need another drink.

820
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:40,556
The inspiration for this painting came on an Indian summer morning

821
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:41,724
in Sagaponack,

822
00:47:42,593 --> 00:47:44,393
when the fog hit the lawn.

823
00:47:45,129 --> 00:47:46,562
Just so...

824
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,732
How long does one of these take to execute?

825
00:47:49,734 --> 00:47:51,200
- Execute? - Hmm.

826
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:52,668
Sounds like a killing.

827
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:56,205
Well, you do stand to make a killing off of these.

828
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,341
Commerce doesn't interest me.

829
00:47:58,343 --> 00:48:01,210
What interests me is the creative process.

830
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:04,046
Well, then, why sell at all?

831
00:48:04,048 --> 00:48:05,648
Each painting is like a birth.

832
00:48:06,384 --> 00:48:07,550
And that is why

833
00:48:08,553 --> 00:48:10,019
it takes a very long time.

834
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,257
And they each need a home in this world.

835
00:48:15,259 --> 00:48:16,559
How long?

836
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,427
Why is she so angry?

837
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:22,298
This painting alone took almost a year.

838
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:24,300
A year!

839
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,135
Shit.

840
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:28,704
Sometimes, the simplest brush strokes

841
00:48:28,706 --> 00:48:30,306
are the most complicated.

842
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,308
- There you are. - Incredible.

843
00:48:32,310 --> 00:48:33,376
Hmm.

844
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:38,414
Great show. So nice of you to include us.

845
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,149
Of course. Where is Adam?

846
00:48:41,185 --> 00:48:43,686
Uh, he is over there.

847
00:48:45,523 --> 00:48:47,356
- He's eating dairy? - Mm.

848
00:48:47,358 --> 00:48:49,325
- The poor thing. - Mm.

849
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:51,394
Well, congratulations. We'll catch up later.

850
00:48:51,396 --> 00:48:53,562
Yes, yes, yes. Get him away from the cheese.

851
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:54,663
Hmm. Hmm.

852
00:48:57,168 --> 00:48:59,502
Peggy, where were we?

853
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:01,504
Fog.

854
00:49:01,506 --> 00:49:03,606
Well, let's sober you up.

855
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:06,409
I haven't had anything to drink. I haven't!

856
00:49:06,411 --> 00:49:09,345
This is... I'm angry.

857
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:12,281
This isn't your first Ravella opening.

858
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,183
I painted some of that.

859
00:49:14,185 --> 00:49:16,652
My simple brush strokes and yours.

860
00:49:16,654 --> 00:49:18,154
I mean, I don't...

861
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:22,258
Well, maybe you've just become numb to it all?

862
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,359
I'm not numb.

863
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:26,462
Okay, you know what? I'm gonna go.

864
00:49:26,464 --> 00:49:28,013
No.

865
00:49:28,015 --> 00:49:29,565
No, I just don't understand, Adam, how you can come here

866
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:32,168
and just let her celebrate?

867
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,737
Okay, this is not about me, is it?

868
00:49:36,674 --> 00:49:37,807
No.

869
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:43,546
Damon is, like, begging me to let him come back.

870
00:49:43,548 --> 00:49:47,149
- And? - I don't know, I mean...

871
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:51,587
We've been together so long, he's all I know.

872
00:49:51,589 --> 00:49:53,856
But I don't want to settle!

873
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:56,225
I want more.

874
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:57,793
And I want you to want more too.

875
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:59,795
Oh, God, why does everybody keep saying that to me?

876
00:49:59,797 --> 00:50:02,498
Listen, it's okay.

877
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,766
It's okay. Listen, I get it,

878
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:05,734
but please don't go?

879
00:50:07,205 --> 00:50:09,305
I want you here. I need you here.

880
00:50:11,175 --> 00:50:12,408
- All right. - Okay?

881
00:50:13,478 --> 00:50:14,877
- I'll stay. - Yes!

882
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:16,712
Yes, but please, please tell me

883
00:50:16,714 --> 00:50:18,214
that's we're not gonna be the last ones to leave.

884
00:50:18,216 --> 00:50:19,315
Oh, absolutely not.

885
00:50:24,388 --> 00:50:26,188
Oh, my God. Holy shit.

886
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:28,524
Isn't that that homeless guy that Cammy went out with?

887
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:29,658
Oh, my God, it is.

888
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,260
I knew it. She's still seeing him.

889
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:33,596
You guys, I still feel dizzy.

890
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:35,431
Well, you don't smoke, Haley.

891
00:50:35,433 --> 00:50:37,800
Yeah, I know, I just didn't want Cammy to feel bad.

892
00:50:37,802 --> 00:50:40,536
- She was smoking alone. - She wouldn't. No one cares.

893
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,638
Wow. You're so right, Adam.

894
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,640
Because, to the matter at hand.

895
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:48,144
What am I looking at?

896
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:49,928
The man inhaling food.

897
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:51,713
- That's Cammy's homeless guy. - That's him?

898
00:50:51,716 --> 00:50:54,783
He has such nice shoes. Oh, Cammy!

899
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:56,218
Oh, Cammy, what?

900
00:50:58,256 --> 00:51:02,358
- Your friend is here. - Oh, I might have mentioned tonight.

901
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,193
I thought you broke it off after dinner.

902
00:51:04,195 --> 00:51:06,295
I did, and then I didn't.

903
00:51:07,832 --> 00:51:09,532
- Okay. - Okay, what?

904
00:51:09,534 --> 00:51:12,401
I'm sorry, not all of us are in relationships or married.

905
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:15,337
Some of us are just trying to get through the day.

906
00:51:15,339 --> 00:51:18,474
And you know what? I didn't break up with him because he was homeless,

907
00:51:18,476 --> 00:51:20,576
or because he was the butt of our collective joke.

908
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:23,212
I broke up with him because he was neurologically confused

909
00:51:23,214 --> 00:51:24,847
and said my pussy tasted like pennies,

910
00:51:24,849 --> 00:51:27,583
which I'm realizing right now, isn't even a deal breaker.

911
00:51:30,555 --> 00:51:32,321
And I slept with Scott James.

912
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,227
Okay, Haley, you don't have to do that.

913
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:42,231
- Do what? - You don't have to take care of Cammy like that.

914
00:51:42,233 --> 00:51:44,233
Hey, can I grab you for a quick shot with Ravella?

915
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,302
Oh, no, just Marklin.

916
00:51:47,238 --> 00:51:48,370
Yeah, sure.

917
00:51:52,543 --> 00:51:53,709
I mean...

918
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:56,645
Talk about irony.

919
00:51:56,647 --> 00:51:58,280
It's like a parallel universe.

920
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:00,281
Can we go?

921
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,716
Please. I've been out the door since I got here.

922
00:52:04,355 --> 00:52:05,621
They were good.

923
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:07,923
So different from your own work.

924
00:52:07,925 --> 00:52:10,426
"Adam, why aren't you working on your own stuff?"

925
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:12,528
I didn't say that. Just making an observation.

926
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:15,764
- Since you brought it up. - I am.

927
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:18,650
Good.

928
00:52:18,652 --> 00:52:20,402
And you can have that with your name on the wall.

929
00:52:20,404 --> 00:52:22,504
Not so easy.

930
00:52:22,506 --> 00:52:24,340
It's not as hard as you make it out to be.

931
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:26,609
Not everyone can get a profile in New Yorker.

932
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:28,444
Oh, my God.

933
00:52:28,446 --> 00:52:30,980
Yeah, I got a break. Big deal.

934
00:52:30,982 --> 00:52:32,948
I got a break after working my ass off.

935
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:35,384
And I also worked my ass off sans break.

936
00:52:35,386 --> 00:52:37,553
You know what? Maybe tonight's not the best night to play Mom.

937
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,023
I'm trying to play supportive boyfriend.

938
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,358
Try harder.

939
00:52:48,566 --> 00:52:49,832
Can we get some more chips, please?

940
00:52:49,834 --> 00:52:51,033
Should've brought Tupperware.

941
00:52:51,035 --> 00:52:53,335
- Hilarious. - Ha-ha!

942
00:52:53,337 --> 00:52:55,771
Homeless joke. That's very funny.

943
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:58,340
I mean, what is home anyway?

944
00:52:58,342 --> 00:52:59,475
That's an excellent question.

945
00:52:59,477 --> 00:53:01,277
We live in a shared economy,

946
00:53:01,279 --> 00:53:02,645
no one owns a car,

947
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:04,046
nobody's buying real estate.

948
00:53:04,048 --> 00:53:06,515
- Aren't you buying a place? - Marklin is.

949
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,083
Nothing definite.

950
00:53:08,085 --> 00:53:09,652
Oh, so you guys will have how many places?

951
00:53:09,654 --> 00:53:11,487
Two. No, three... Two?

952
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:13,022
The plan is to have just one together.

953
00:53:13,024 --> 00:53:14,757
- Oh, is that the plan? - Hmm.

954
00:53:17,762 --> 00:53:19,495
The show was fun tonight.

955
00:53:19,497 --> 00:53:20,996
Never been to a gallery opening.

956
00:53:20,998 --> 00:53:23,332
I mean, it was good, considering, you know,

957
00:53:23,334 --> 00:53:25,000
Adam painted mostly everything in there.

958
00:53:25,002 --> 00:53:26,402
Yeah, invisible.

959
00:53:26,404 --> 00:53:29,705
- Oh, no! Who bought these? - Whoo!

960
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:31,073
The table over there.

961
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:33,375
They're big fans.

962
00:53:33,377 --> 00:53:35,544
- Big fans. Visible. - Thanks!

963
00:53:35,546 --> 00:53:37,713
- Who wants to do slap shots? - I do.

964
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:39,715
- What is that? - I read about it in Teen Vogue.

965
00:53:39,717 --> 00:53:40,983
Or was it regular Vogue? I can't remember,

966
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:42,851
but you do the shot and you get slapped

967
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:44,320
- while you suck a lime. - Oh, yeah!

968
00:53:44,322 --> 00:53:46,689
Wow. You do the slap instead of a lime.

969
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:47,990
Okay, none of this sounds good.

970
00:53:47,992 --> 00:53:49,892
No, come on. That sounds like fun.

971
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:51,493
Come on, who's first?

972
00:53:51,495 --> 00:53:53,962
Come on, everybody. We're gonna play slap shots.

973
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:56,699
- Who's first? - I'll go.

974
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:57,966
This is so waiting for Cammy.

975
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:00,102
Okay.

976
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:04,807
- Ow! - I barely hit you.

977
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,975
- Asshole! - Please. Can we just do the shots?

978
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,811
Fuck that! My turn. Adam. Go.

979
00:54:10,915 --> 00:54:12,614
Oh!

980
00:54:12,616 --> 00:54:14,450
- Goddamn! - Oh, no!

981
00:54:14,452 --> 00:54:16,819
It's my turn. My turn.

982
00:54:23,094 --> 00:54:24,393
Marklin.

983
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:34,085
You can hit me.

984
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:35,637
Yeah, how about just drinking without violence?

985
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,039
No, it's my turn.

986
00:55:13,511 --> 00:55:15,110
Oh!

987
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:16,879
- Oh, my God. - Adam?

988
00:55:16,881 --> 00:55:18,113
- Adam? - I'm fine.

989
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:22,151
I'm sorry.

990
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:27,656
Give him a minute.

991
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:29,425
- Yeah, just let him... - But it looks like he's really hurt.

992
00:55:29,427 --> 00:55:31,193
Why did I hit him so hard?

993
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:32,594
He's been like this all night.

994
00:55:40,771 --> 00:55:42,971
Oh, my God. Of course!

995
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:45,073
This.

996
00:55:46,544 --> 00:55:47,709
Excuse me?

997
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,079
Somebody in...

998
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:55,451
Hey, can someone turn that fucking jingle off?

999
00:55:57,221 --> 00:55:58,587
Aw, man!

1000
00:55:59,123 --> 00:56:00,556
It's an ice cream van.

1001
00:56:02,793 --> 00:56:03,959
Hello?

1002
00:56:13,671 --> 00:56:14,803
Okay.

1003
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:32,621
It's this one.

1004
00:56:37,928 --> 00:56:40,095
Wait, how did you...

1005
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,166
Sit.

1006
00:56:59,717 --> 00:57:00,849
Where are we going?

1007
00:57:07,091 --> 00:57:08,223
Trust me.

1008
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,571
The fuck you doing on my truck?

1009
00:57:24,875 --> 00:57:27,075
Oh, Jesus. What happened to you?

1010
00:57:27,077 --> 00:57:28,844
- What? - Your head, man.

1011
00:57:28,846 --> 00:57:31,113
- Cut up, bleeding. - I think I'm fine.

1012
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,281
I think you should probably see a doctor.

1013
00:57:32,283 --> 00:57:34,532
Look, I said I'm fine, all right?

1014
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:36,784
I just want that fucking jingle to stop.

1015
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,154
- Jingle's not playing, man. - It's always playing.

1016
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:42,558
I know you.

1017
00:57:44,662 --> 00:57:45,827
The pool.

1018
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:56,605
Oh, no!

1019
00:57:56,607 --> 00:57:58,574
- Oh, no! - How are you feeling?

1020
00:57:58,576 --> 00:57:59,641
Mm-hmm.

1021
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:01,944
Um, embarrassed?

1022
00:58:01,946 --> 00:58:03,345
Well, that was a pro move.

1023
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:04,813
If by pro, you mean dick.

1024
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:06,848
That incessant song, though.

1025
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,784
I can see how it can make people do things.

1026
00:58:08,786 --> 00:58:10,285
I blame noise pollution, not Adam.

1027
00:58:12,022 --> 00:58:14,222
- Did I actually hit you? - Not even close.

1028
00:58:14,224 --> 00:58:16,325
You hit, like... What's the PC way of saying "like a girl"?

1029
00:58:16,327 --> 00:58:17,693
Girl.

1030
00:58:17,695 --> 00:58:18,794
I'm sorry.

1031
00:58:20,364 --> 00:58:24,666
Hey, who's the cute ice cream truck guy?

1032
00:58:24,668 --> 00:58:26,101
Oh, my God!

1033
00:58:26,103 --> 00:58:27,803
He looks more like a Roman statue

1034
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:29,171
than an ice cream vendor.

1035
00:58:29,173 --> 00:58:31,873
Yeah, but, ice cream trucks are, like, very creepy,

1036
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,709
and also, very dirty.

1037
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:36,211
I mean, what am I gonna get? A cone with some E. coli on top?

1038
00:58:36,213 --> 00:58:38,680
Those trucks are actually cleaner than most restaurants.

1039
00:58:38,682 --> 00:58:40,983
They have to pass a lot of inspections to operate.

1040
00:58:40,985 --> 00:58:42,985
Okay, how do you even know that?

1041
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:44,853
Well, the young lady would be correct.

1042
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:47,656
Hey, I hope I didn't mess up your truck.

1043
00:58:47,658 --> 00:58:49,057
We gotta stop meeting like this.

1044
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:51,793
How do you two know each other?

1045
00:58:51,795 --> 00:58:53,829
Uh, we met at the gym.

1046
00:58:53,831 --> 00:58:56,331
Oh, my God. Gay guys should never be like, "Met at the gym."

1047
00:58:57,034 --> 00:58:59,368
Oh, I'm not gay.

1048
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:01,136
You're not? Me too.

1049
00:59:01,138 --> 00:59:02,671
I mean, neither am I.

1050
00:59:04,274 --> 00:59:05,907
All right, then.

1051
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,309
Can you guys give us a minute?

1052
00:59:07,311 --> 00:59:09,144
- Yup, that's something we could do. - Yup.

1053
00:59:09,146 --> 00:59:10,212
Everybody out.

1054
00:59:11,215 --> 00:59:13,315
- Yeah. - Cool. We'll be...

1055
00:59:21,792 --> 00:59:23,125
I don't know what to say.

1056
00:59:24,995 --> 00:59:26,128
What's going on with you?

1057
00:59:27,731 --> 00:59:28,897
A lot, I guess.

1058
00:59:30,334 --> 00:59:32,734
I just think the show last night really got to me.

1059
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:35,370
Of course, it did.

1060
00:59:37,775 --> 00:59:40,776
It's not just that. It's everything. It's...

1061
00:59:45,849 --> 00:59:47,249
Are you having

1062
00:59:48,352 --> 00:59:49,918
something outside of us?

1063
00:59:51,088 --> 00:59:52,154
No!

1064
00:59:54,725 --> 00:59:55,824
Adam, no!

1065
00:59:58,095 --> 00:59:59,695
Okay.

1066
00:59:59,697 --> 01:00:00,829
Just no secrets.

1067
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:04,166
No secrets.

1068
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:08,770
Yeah, I always thought I'd be in such a different place by now.

1069
01:00:08,772 --> 01:00:11,973
That I'd have a lot more of my life figured out.

1070
01:00:14,011 --> 01:00:16,845
I'm not and I don't.

1071
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:20,782
It's not such a cute look when 40's in sight.

1072
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:25,153
I think if we can get through this rough patch,

1073
01:00:25,155 --> 01:00:26,421
we're gonna be just fine.

1074
01:00:27,891 --> 01:00:30,292
And strong, and invincible.

1075
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:33,128
Yeah, me too.

1076
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:36,498
What is it Sensitive Ken always says?

1077
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:40,769
That he accepts cash and credit cards?

1078
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:43,739
Stop.

1079
01:00:45,075 --> 01:00:47,976
- What? - We need to communicate.

1080
01:00:48,979 --> 01:00:50,178
Oh.

1081
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:53,815
It's so easy, right?

1082
01:00:58,422 --> 01:01:00,489
You didn't really sleep with Scott James, did you?

1083
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:04,025
Um, emotionally.

1084
01:01:04,027 --> 01:01:06,762
- Haley, he's a child! - No, I didn't.

1085
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:08,930
I just said it because I felt left out.

1086
01:01:08,932 --> 01:01:10,832
The thing is, I think I really love him.

1087
01:01:10,834 --> 01:01:12,167
Okay, maybe you do.

1088
01:01:12,169 --> 01:01:14,469
Like, the way a parent loves a child.

1089
01:01:14,471 --> 01:01:16,104
It's all so confusing.

1090
01:01:16,507 --> 01:01:18,006
He needs me.

1091
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:20,142
Like, he really needs me.

1092
01:01:20,144 --> 01:01:22,511
Like, beyond how anyone's every needed me before.

1093
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:25,514
No, Haley, he's dependent on you, okay?

1094
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:28,884
And you doing all these things for him, is not going to help him in the future.

1095
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:31,219
I mean, it's only going to make him more dependent on you.

1096
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:33,522
Sorry, it's just like Adam and Marklin's relationship.

1097
01:01:34,858 --> 01:01:36,224
He didn't get into Brown.

1098
01:01:36,226 --> 01:01:37,859
Good. He never would have made it.

1099
01:01:39,329 --> 01:01:41,029
I've never owned a dog.

1100
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:43,832
I can't keep a single succulent alive.

1101
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:45,333
I don't want them to find my body someday

1102
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:47,068
under a pile of New Yorker magazines

1103
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,804
and cat hair and take-out containers.

1104
01:01:48,806 --> 01:01:50,238
You don't even read New Yorker magazine.

1105
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,541
Cammy, I'm being serious.

1106
01:01:52,543 --> 01:01:55,277
Okay, yeah, I know it sucks,

1107
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:57,412
but the only thing you could do is just

1108
01:01:57,414 --> 01:01:59,981
wake up every day and hope for the best.

1109
01:02:01,118 --> 01:02:02,884
Ugh, I'm going to throw up in my mouth.

1110
01:02:02,886 --> 01:02:04,886
- This is way too many feelings... - I love you, Cammy.

1111
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:06,421
Okay.

1112
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:07,823
Thanks.

1113
01:02:08,892 --> 01:02:10,559
Oh, speaking of throwing up.

1114
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:13,195
Why is it so easy for her?

1115
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:15,197
Easy? She's getting divorced.

1116
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:17,232
Mm. Yeah, there's that.

1117
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:18,333
I guess, I should too.

1118
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:20,836
What?

1119
01:02:20,838 --> 01:02:22,037
Divorce Scott James.

1120
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,405
Oh, I guess you should.

1121
01:02:23,407 --> 01:02:24,873
- Yes. - No, do.

1122
01:02:26,877 --> 01:02:29,110
Looked like you two were really hitting it off.

1123
01:02:29,112 --> 01:02:30,912
I bet he knows so much about the decline

1124
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:32,013
of the food truck movement.

1125
01:02:32,015 --> 01:02:33,515
Mm, this is so delicious.

1126
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:35,584
That is all he talked about.

1127
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:38,453
Ice cream, ice cream. I know so much about ice cream.

1128
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:42,057
He does have big plans, though.

1129
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:44,860
He wants to expand to Austin, Detroit and it just...

1130
01:02:44,862 --> 01:02:47,062
It's just, what a snoozefest.

1131
01:02:47,064 --> 01:02:48,396
At least he doesn't live in his vehicle.

1132
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:50,698
And he's not a minor.

1133
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,001
God, being single sucks, you guys. I don't know how you do it.

1134
01:02:53,003 --> 01:02:55,102
It's not really a choice.

1135
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,204
Yeah, it's not like when I was a little girl, I had a dream of just

1136
01:02:57,207 --> 01:02:59,875
having dates with an endless parade of cautionary tales.

1137
01:02:59,877 --> 01:03:03,945
Yeah, I'm jealous of what you and Damon have. Had.

1138
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,580
And what Adam and Marklin have.

1139
01:03:05,582 --> 01:03:07,498
I don't think you all get it.

1140
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:09,417
Despite all the problems, you still have someone there for you.

1141
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:10,952
Yeah, someone you want to murder.

1142
01:03:10,954 --> 01:03:12,954
Oh, I would kill to murder someone.

1143
01:03:12,956 --> 01:03:16,925
Oh, look, Adam's getting discharged.

1144
01:03:16,927 --> 01:03:18,059
That was quick.

1145
01:03:18,061 --> 01:03:19,661
- Here, give him this. - Whoa.

1146
01:03:19,663 --> 01:03:23,265
Okay, he's not a hurricane victim, but cool.

1147
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:24,715
Yeah, it's just a bump on the head.

1148
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:26,166
Listen, this has been fun, girls, but...

1149
01:03:27,304 --> 01:03:29,237
I've gotta go swallow a bottle of Lexapro.

1150
01:03:29,239 --> 01:03:31,172
Ooh! I'll come join you.

1151
01:03:56,366 --> 01:03:59,334
I have some paperwork for you to sign as his medical proxy.

1152
01:04:01,338 --> 01:04:03,238
Uh, I think I already signed it.

1153
01:04:03,240 --> 01:04:05,540
We don't have instructions for the DNR.

1154
01:04:07,177 --> 01:04:08,443
Okay. Um...

1155
01:04:11,381 --> 01:04:13,048
He doesn't want to be revived,

1156
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:15,183
so I can sign this one?

1157
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:19,220
Not to bother you,

1158
01:04:19,222 --> 01:04:21,723
but, I love The Detailist.

1159
01:04:21,725 --> 01:04:23,291
I got these last month.

1160
01:04:27,531 --> 01:04:31,166
We've made him very comfortable, if it's any consolation.

1161
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:33,068
Thank you.

1162
01:04:40,978 --> 01:04:42,444
You haven't told Adam yet.

1163
01:04:45,082 --> 01:04:46,214
No.

1164
01:04:47,351 --> 01:04:50,051
I was going to, then I just didn't.

1165
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:56,124
'Cause I thought he was gonna get better.

1166
01:04:56,126 --> 01:04:58,126
This whole situation would resolve itself

1167
01:04:58,128 --> 01:05:00,996
and now it's just so huge.

1168
01:05:00,998 --> 01:05:04,432
I mean, you guys did spend all that time together.

1169
01:05:04,434 --> 01:05:05,500
You and Karl.

1170
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,670
I can't tell Adam about all this.

1171
01:05:11,475 --> 01:05:13,274
That you are your ex's medical proxy

1172
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:15,043
and you just signed his DNR?

1173
01:05:15,479 --> 01:05:16,578
Yeah, you don't.

1174
01:05:18,315 --> 01:05:20,015
I don't want to do that anymore.

1175
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,420
You really put yourself in a tricky position, boo.

1176
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,291
Adam thinks I'm having an affair.

1177
01:05:31,328 --> 01:05:33,061
Lies, an affair.

1178
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:35,363
Both are pretty shitty.

1179
01:05:42,105 --> 01:05:43,805
I think I love Karl more than Adam.

1180
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:49,210
It's always easy to love someone who's unavailable.

1181
01:05:49,212 --> 01:05:50,345
Trust me.

1182
01:05:50,347 --> 01:05:52,280
Don't curate your past, okay?

1183
01:05:54,251 --> 01:05:58,353
Karl and I just fit together, somehow.

1184
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,356
More than Adam.

1185
01:06:06,063 --> 01:06:08,329
I should just be single.

1186
01:06:10,233 --> 01:06:12,400
Maybe.

1187
01:06:14,237 --> 01:06:16,504
- Really? - I don't fucking know.

1188
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:19,174
Why does everyone think I have the magical answers to life

1189
01:06:19,176 --> 01:06:20,809
as they pertain to relationships?

1190
01:06:20,811 --> 01:06:23,044
Why is that?

1191
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:25,280
Goddamn, I fucking don't. You're a mess.

1192
01:06:25,282 --> 01:06:27,482
I am. I am so messy.

1193
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:30,585
I need a broom. I am so messy.

1194
01:06:30,587 --> 01:06:32,854
- So am I. - Oh, shit!

1195
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:41,696
Adam.

1196
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:38,386
You gonna go through every single book?

1197
01:07:38,388 --> 01:07:39,888
Well, some of them had notes in them.

1198
01:07:39,890 --> 01:07:41,189
See?

1199
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:43,358
Honey.

1200
01:07:46,196 --> 01:07:48,530
This is called emotional cutting.

1201
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:50,331
It's closure.

1202
01:07:51,535 --> 01:07:52,667
Give me that.

1203
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:59,507
"Adam, I can't imagine a day without the sun, or without you."

1204
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:02,710
- Come on. - It's sweet.

1205
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:05,313
If you like crap. Toss it.

1206
01:08:05,315 --> 01:08:06,648
Toss it. Come on, toss it!

1207
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,416
- I will. - I burned mine.

1208
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,418
This feels good.

1209
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:11,953
What about this?

1210
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:15,290
Uh, Goodwill.

1211
01:08:15,292 --> 01:08:16,691
I got it for, like, 40 bucks on eBay.

1212
01:08:16,693 --> 01:08:17,926
Mm.

1213
01:08:17,928 --> 01:08:19,694
Or keep it, or keep it, I don't know.

1214
01:08:19,696 --> 01:08:21,296
No, no, no.

1215
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:23,631
We're moving on, okay? Gotta let it go.

1216
01:08:25,969 --> 01:08:28,102
God, there's so much shit.

1217
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:30,238
Marklin was right. It's like a museum to another time.

1218
01:08:30,240 --> 01:08:32,306
You wanted to sell the house,

1219
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,375
no one wanted to buy it, now they did, and so, you're done.

1220
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:37,745
It's ironic that now that I've finally done it, it's too late.

1221
01:08:37,747 --> 01:08:40,582
Listen to me, it's not too late because the house wasn't sold.

1222
01:08:40,584 --> 01:08:43,318
It's too late because he's just as stuck as you are

1223
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:45,687
and he's too stubborn to admit it, okay?

1224
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:50,491
Marklin is the only person Karl had to fucking pull the fucking plug?

1225
01:08:50,493 --> 01:08:51,893
He's not pulling the plug.

1226
01:08:51,895 --> 01:08:53,328
You know what I mean.

1227
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:59,334
Come on, Adam, get mad for fuck's sake!

1228
01:08:59,336 --> 01:09:00,935
I am mad. I broke up with him.

1229
01:09:00,937 --> 01:09:03,638
Okay, if this is mad, I'd like to see furious.

1230
01:09:04,474 --> 01:09:05,940
I am furious.

1231
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:10,478
- Please! - I am, okay?

1232
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,648
- God! - Do you need me to smack you? 'Cause I will.

1233
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:14,816
- No. - 'Cause I will.

1234
01:09:24,527 --> 01:09:25,927
My God, that felt so good.

1235
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:27,645
Yes! Yes!

1236
01:09:27,647 --> 01:09:29,364
Let's break some more shit. Let's break some more shit.

1237
01:09:29,366 --> 01:09:31,315
Get all that shit.

1238
01:09:31,317 --> 01:09:33,267
- They're so ugly. - Yes, get the swan, get the owl.

1239
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,436
- Okay, all right. - Get that tiny horse.

1240
01:09:35,438 --> 01:09:38,773
I am starting to get a little bit worried.

1241
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:40,842
- Let's go. We're gonna get big. - Huh?

1242
01:09:40,844 --> 01:09:43,578
Oh, God!

1243
01:09:43,580 --> 01:09:44,946
That felt really good.

1244
01:09:48,785 --> 01:09:51,052
Oh, my God. This one's going to be a bigger crash, ready?

1245
01:09:51,054 --> 01:09:52,887
Oh, yes!

1246
01:09:52,889 --> 01:09:54,489
Keep going. I'm not done.

1247
01:09:54,491 --> 01:09:55,923
Oh, this is fun. Yes.

1248
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,660
- No, you don't want to... - Oh!

1249
01:09:59,462 --> 01:10:00,528
Oh!

1250
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:04,732
Sorry, I want to keep this.

1251
01:10:04,734 --> 01:10:07,035
Oh, God, yes. Charlie Brown.

1252
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:09,537
I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

1253
01:10:10,340 --> 01:10:11,572
Oh, that felt good.

1254
01:10:12,475 --> 01:10:13,541
You got me.

1255
01:10:13,543 --> 01:10:14,942
Oh, God.

1256
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:16,010
Last one.

1257
01:10:21,551 --> 01:10:23,851
It's like on Hoarders.

1258
01:10:23,853 --> 01:10:27,388
We all have to get rid of parts of ourselves.

1259
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,890
It's called growth.

1260
01:10:28,892 --> 01:10:30,758
I'm not a hoarder.

1261
01:10:30,760 --> 01:10:34,495
Well, you have the luxury of space which gives the illusion

1262
01:10:34,497 --> 01:10:37,932
of not holding on to a bunch of crap.

1263
01:10:40,770 --> 01:10:42,804
Where am I gonna go?

1264
01:10:42,806 --> 01:10:44,672
If I had known we were going to split up,

1265
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:45,973
I would have held onto this place.

1266
01:10:47,777 --> 01:10:49,110
Are you kidding me right now?

1267
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,013
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1268
01:10:52,682 --> 01:10:54,048
New Adam.

1269
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,516
Not old Adam.

1270
01:10:56,486 --> 01:10:58,019
Come on.

1271
01:10:58,021 --> 01:11:00,355
Come on, you gotta promise me that we're both...

1272
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:04,425
We're both only going to move forward.

1273
01:11:06,529 --> 01:11:07,595
I promise.

1274
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,933
Yeah?

1275
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:16,771
Good.

1276
01:11:19,743 --> 01:11:20,808
Forward.

1277
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,930
- Hey, Dad. Sorry I'm late. - Adam.

1278
01:11:42,932 --> 01:11:44,966
Okay. You look fabulous.

1279
01:11:44,968 --> 01:11:46,501
Thank you. You too.

1280
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:49,103
Well, your stepmom, okay?

1281
01:11:49,105 --> 01:11:51,105
She's got me riding the bicycle,

1282
01:11:51,107 --> 01:11:52,573
painting the house,

1283
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,475
even doing a little gardening, okay?

1284
01:11:54,477 --> 01:11:55,777
I got my green thumb.

1285
01:11:56,846 --> 01:11:58,446
Hopefully not a limp wrist.

1286
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,950
This is my son, Adam, okay? The famous artist.

1287
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:07,688
- What can I get you? - Ah! Top of the morning to you.

1288
01:12:07,690 --> 01:12:08,823
It's an Italian restaurant, Dad.

1289
01:12:10,660 --> 01:12:12,593
- Just a Diet Coke, please. - A Diet Coke?

1290
01:12:12,595 --> 01:12:14,095
- Sir? - I'm good.

1291
01:12:14,097 --> 01:12:16,831
- You need a moment? - Yes, please. Thank you.

1292
01:12:18,201 --> 01:12:20,200
I got to hit the John.

1293
01:12:20,202 --> 01:12:22,202
Been drinking a lot of water. All this running around.

1294
01:12:22,205 --> 01:12:23,471
Okay.

1295
01:13:06,950 --> 01:13:09,116
I swear, the bathrooms in the city

1296
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:10,785
are getting smaller.

1297
01:13:10,787 --> 01:13:13,621
Back when I did the plumbing at Radio City, okay,

1298
01:13:13,623 --> 01:13:15,490
there were walls of toilets.

1299
01:13:15,492 --> 01:13:18,059
Walls. You never had to wait.

1300
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:19,894
This is a restaurant, not a concert hall.

1301
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:20,995
Hmm.

1302
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:25,066
Yeah.

1303
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:27,235
How's the painting? How's Marklin?

1304
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:29,270
You know, they profiled him in our local paper.

1305
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:32,607
They mentioned you,

1306
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:34,775
but they didn't say anything about your art.

1307
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:38,980
Dad...

1308
01:13:41,918 --> 01:13:43,050
Marklin and I...

1309
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,704
Thank you.

1310
01:13:47,706 --> 01:13:49,656
I told you about my son, the famous artist, right?

1311
01:13:49,659 --> 01:13:50,791
Yes, you did.

1312
01:13:50,793 --> 01:13:52,627
When he was a kid, okay?

1313
01:13:52,629 --> 01:13:54,896
He used to sneak into the city to go to SoHo.

1314
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:57,131
Wow.

1315
01:13:57,133 --> 01:13:59,100
Lot of freedom. Just need a few more minutes.

1316
01:13:59,102 --> 01:14:00,201
Absolutely.

1317
01:14:02,805 --> 01:14:04,672
- You can't do that. - What?

1318
01:14:04,674 --> 01:14:06,207
Be proud of my son?

1319
01:14:06,209 --> 01:14:08,676
- Make everyone feel... - Feel what?

1320
01:14:10,647 --> 01:14:11,812
Dad, I know you're proud,

1321
01:14:11,814 --> 01:14:14,582
but you can't put people on the spot.

1322
01:14:14,584 --> 01:14:16,083
I didn't put him on the spot.

1323
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:19,020
- He was impressed. - You put me on the spot.

1324
01:14:19,022 --> 01:14:20,755
I don't like to talk about myself.

1325
01:14:21,925 --> 01:14:25,693
You know, I learned from my AA,

1326
01:14:25,695 --> 01:14:27,628
you gotta own who you are.

1327
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,163
You can't apologize.

1328
01:14:29,165 --> 01:14:30,665
I don't want to apologize.

1329
01:14:33,836 --> 01:14:34,902
Your AA?

1330
01:14:36,072 --> 01:14:38,306
Every morning, 7 o'clock.

1331
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:39,907
- Every morning? - Yeah.

1332
01:14:40,910 --> 01:14:42,143
It works if you work it.

1333
01:14:43,012 --> 01:14:44,145
Yeah, I know the slogans.

1334
01:14:45,949 --> 01:14:47,315
Al-Anon uses them too.

1335
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:54,722
That's great, Dad.

1336
01:14:55,725 --> 01:14:58,192
Well, enough about me, okay?

1337
01:14:58,194 --> 01:15:01,028
When do I get to come to a big gallery opening?

1338
01:15:01,030 --> 01:15:03,064
Uh, Ravella has a show now.

1339
01:15:03,066 --> 01:15:06,233
I don't care about her. I'm talking about you.

1340
01:15:06,235 --> 01:15:08,869
- My son is going to be the next Picasso. - Dad!

1341
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:15,109
I'll let you know.

1342
01:15:23,186 --> 01:15:24,352
Don't settle, Adam.

1343
01:15:25,788 --> 01:15:26,921
Not like I did.

1344
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:31,392
You deserve it all.

1345
01:15:57,320 --> 01:15:58,953
- Hi. - Hi.

1346
01:16:01,424 --> 01:16:02,857
I texted you before I came.

1347
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:06,727
Well, I was in the neighborhood

1348
01:16:06,729 --> 01:16:09,163
and I brought some coffee and those bagels you like.

1349
01:16:10,833 --> 01:16:12,400
Should we photograph them first?

1350
01:16:13,269 --> 01:16:15,002
Ha-ha!

1351
01:16:15,905 --> 01:16:17,038
Thank you.

1352
01:16:17,373 --> 01:16:18,739
Come in.

1353
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:20,741
- Sure? - Yeah.

1354
01:16:34,323 --> 01:16:35,690
Do you need a hand?

1355
01:16:35,692 --> 01:16:36,757
No, I'm good.

1356
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:39,160
You know you can shower at home.

1357
01:16:40,096 --> 01:16:42,396
- Come on. - I've got it.

1358
01:16:42,398 --> 01:16:44,465
Hold the bottom, hold the bottom.

1359
01:16:44,467 --> 01:16:46,400
I've got it. Shit!

1360
01:16:47,470 --> 01:16:49,352
Damn it.

1361
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,237
For the son of a plumber, this is pretty busted.

1362
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,916
Are you going to stop this nonsense and come home?

1363
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:07,888
Where's home?

1364
01:17:10,359 --> 01:17:11,826
Pulled the offer on the apartment.

1365
01:17:14,897 --> 01:17:16,864
You were right.

1366
01:17:16,866 --> 01:17:18,365
Wasn't going to be ours, it was going to be mine.

1367
01:17:21,471 --> 01:17:22,837
You didn't have to do that.

1368
01:17:24,307 --> 01:17:25,473
Yeah, I did.

1369
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:29,176
When did this all turn into shit?

1370
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:37,318
Not all of it.

1371
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:44,291
I want to show you something.

1372
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:00,474
Is that Ravella's?

1373
01:18:03,146 --> 01:18:04,979
Wait, did you...

1374
01:18:04,981 --> 01:18:06,347
Yeah, I kept one.

1375
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:16,257
This is yours?

1376
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,461
Wow.

1377
01:18:20,463 --> 01:18:21,529
It's a start.

1378
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:25,299
It's fantastic.

1379
01:18:28,938 --> 01:18:30,037
What are you doing?

1380
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:33,407
You wanna do the honors?

1381
01:18:34,844 --> 01:18:37,077
It's not hers. It's not mine.

1382
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:39,413
Adam, no.

1383
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:43,551
Yeah, I don't even know why I kept it.

1384
01:18:43,553 --> 01:18:45,119
I could probably never sell it.

1385
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:48,122
Just made me feel safe somehow.

1386
01:18:49,592 --> 01:18:51,091
Like the house upstate.

1387
01:18:53,496 --> 01:18:54,895
I wasn't gonna say that.

1388
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:00,100
I was gonna say, like the new apartment,

1389
01:19:01,204 --> 01:19:02,269
for me.

1390
01:19:08,211 --> 01:19:09,343
Like Karl.

1391
01:19:14,884 --> 01:19:16,550
What you did for Karl...

1392
01:19:18,554 --> 01:19:21,422
Taking care of people, Marklin, that's...

1393
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:23,324
That's the whole reason that I fell in love with you.

1394
01:19:25,027 --> 01:19:28,062
And just walking in on it, I...

1395
01:19:32,034 --> 01:19:33,601
I want you to take care of me

1396
01:19:34,570 --> 01:19:36,303
and I want to take care of you.

1397
01:19:36,305 --> 01:19:39,607
But we pretend that we don't need that.

1398
01:19:41,377 --> 01:19:44,211
What I said at the hospital... I was really upset.

1399
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:46,480
I know. Me too.

1400
01:19:49,552 --> 01:19:50,885
I'm not perfect.

1401
01:19:52,955 --> 01:19:54,054
Never gonna be.

1402
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:58,993
With you, I get pretty close.

1403
01:19:59,528 --> 01:20:01,996
Same. With you.

1404
01:20:05,034 --> 01:20:09,036
And I broke up with someone caring for a terminal patient.

1405
01:20:09,038 --> 01:20:12,373
That's not so perfect.

1406
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:16,543
How is Karl?

1407
01:20:17,513 --> 01:20:19,380
Remarkably, he's rallying.

1408
01:20:19,382 --> 01:20:20,581
Good. I'm so glad.

1409
01:20:23,352 --> 01:20:24,451
So now what?

1410
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:37,197
Mm.

1411
01:20:39,302 --> 01:20:42,369
Holy shit!

1412
01:20:43,406 --> 01:20:46,407
Wow! That feels good.

1413
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:50,177
Your turn.

1414
01:21:07,263 --> 01:21:10,064
You know, I am gonna need these canvases for me.

1415
01:21:15,304 --> 01:21:16,537
It's really good.

1416
01:21:18,207 --> 01:21:19,306
We'll see.

1417
01:21:27,316 --> 01:21:29,383
Well, thanks, Haley, for everything.

1418
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:30,751
Oh, you got in on your own.

1419
01:21:30,753 --> 01:21:32,653
I mean, it's not Brown.

1420
01:21:32,655 --> 01:21:36,757
No, but, you know, Penn's not a bad safety school.

1421
01:21:36,759 --> 01:21:38,359
Well, it's not a safety school at all.

1422
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:41,495
Yeah, no. I know.

1423
01:21:41,497 --> 01:21:44,598
But the important thing is, you did it on your own.

1424
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,000
That's it, huh?

1425
01:21:48,304 --> 01:21:50,337
We better hurry. It's a bit of a drive.

1426
01:21:53,509 --> 01:21:55,376
It's okay, right?

1427
01:21:55,378 --> 01:21:57,711
Oh, yeah, I was just kidding about Penn being a safety school.

1428
01:21:57,713 --> 01:21:59,046
It's more than okay.

1429
01:21:59,048 --> 01:22:01,181
Well, I mean about Karina.

1430
01:22:01,183 --> 01:22:02,683
Oh, God, yes.

1431
01:22:02,685 --> 01:22:04,151
- Mm-hmm. - Good.

1432
01:22:06,622 --> 01:22:09,390
Well, thanks, Haley.

1433
01:22:09,392 --> 01:22:11,258
For teaching a man how to fish

1434
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:13,127
and not just filleting the fish.

1435
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:16,530
Sure.

1436
01:22:16,532 --> 01:22:18,098
- Come here. - Okay, yeah.

1437
01:22:23,773 --> 01:22:25,105
Nope.

1438
01:22:30,346 --> 01:22:31,512
What a piece of work.

1439
01:22:33,449 --> 01:22:35,282
He's never gonna be able to fish on his own.

1440
01:22:37,653 --> 01:22:39,186
You got him into Penn.

1441
01:22:46,295 --> 01:22:47,528
Okay.

1442
01:22:49,098 --> 01:22:50,364
Use those mirrors.

1443
01:22:59,275 --> 01:23:00,441
Goddamnit.

1444
01:23:03,546 --> 01:23:06,413
Hi! I know the map says take 9th Avenue,

1445
01:23:06,415 --> 01:23:07,781
but if you take Westside Highway,

1446
01:23:07,783 --> 01:23:10,150
that would be amazing.

1447
01:23:10,152 --> 01:23:11,318
Any way you want.

1448
01:23:15,357 --> 01:23:17,257
I don't know what's happening right now.

1449
01:23:17,259 --> 01:23:19,226
I circled your block for days,

1450
01:23:19,228 --> 01:23:22,396
waiting for you to finally log in for a ride.

1451
01:23:22,398 --> 01:23:24,565
- So... - Wow.

1452
01:23:24,567 --> 01:23:27,367
- That is, um... - Yeah?

1453
01:23:27,369 --> 01:23:30,304
That's a little creepy, but very sweet.

1454
01:23:32,675 --> 01:23:34,208
You got a job.

1455
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:36,276
Well, I've got to pay my rent somehow, right?

1456
01:23:36,278 --> 01:23:38,345
- Rent? Wow! - Yep.

1457
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:42,616
- All right, now. - It was all thanks to you.

1458
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:45,586
And my neurological confusion.

1459
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:48,789
- I'm gonna be late. - Okay.

1460
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,693
This is so weird.

1461
01:23:54,630 --> 01:23:56,412
Relax.

1462
01:23:56,414 --> 01:23:58,197
You know, I actually bought this tie on your website.

1463
01:23:58,200 --> 01:23:59,366
Why are you such a dick?

1464
01:24:02,204 --> 01:24:04,138
- We're doing this, right? - Yes.

1465
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:06,540
Yes, we are.

1466
01:24:07,276 --> 01:24:08,509
Good.

1467
01:24:09,912 --> 01:24:11,378
Here goes.

1468
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:12,880
You're next, huh?

1469
01:24:12,882 --> 01:24:15,449
Uh, we'll see.

1470
01:24:15,451 --> 01:24:17,518
Come on! You've been together for years.

1471
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,486
Nah, this is our first date.

1472
01:24:20,756 --> 01:24:22,589
- Oh. - Okay.

1473
01:24:25,794 --> 01:24:27,194
It is, isn't it?

1474
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,795
Fresh start.

1475
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:30,898
Bingo.

1476
01:24:31,634 --> 01:24:32,733
Bingo.

1477
01:24:34,503 --> 01:24:37,204
I gotta go. So do you.

1478
01:24:37,206 --> 01:24:38,405
That's true.

1479
01:25:04,400 --> 01:25:06,833
Looking good, girl. Yes!

1480
01:25:17,379 --> 01:25:18,579
Thank you.

1481
01:25:19,415 --> 01:25:20,581
Clean slate.

1482
01:25:21,383 --> 01:25:22,583
Forward.

1483
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:35,796
Why wait, right?

1484
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:41,468
Right?
