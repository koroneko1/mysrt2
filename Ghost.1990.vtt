· Oh ·

00:12:01.763 --> 00:12:06.392
· My love ·

00:12:06.517 --> 00:12:09.812
· My darlin'·

00:12:09.854 --> 00:12:12.315
· I've hungered for... ·

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:13.775
What are you doing?

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:16.819
I couldn't sleep.

00:12:16.903 --> 00:12:19.822
· A long ·

00:12:19.906 --> 00:12:22.116
· Lonely time ·

00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.160
I must
have passed out.

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:26.371
What time is it?

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:27.830
It's 2 a.m.

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:31.501
· And time ·

00:12:31.584 --> 00:12:35.338
· Goes by ·

00:12:35.505 --> 00:12:38.758
· So slowly ·

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.719
· And time ·

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:45.723
· Can do so much ·

00:12:45.848 --> 00:12:49.727
· Are you ·

00:12:49.852 --> 00:12:52.146
· Still mine ·

00:12:52.271 --> 00:12:54.232
Oh, no.

00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:56.359
I hope it wasn't
a masterpiece.

00:12:56.484 --> 00:12:58.152
It's not now.

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.322
Can I help?

00:13:01.406 --> 00:13:02.448
Yeah.

00:13:02.573 --> 00:13:05.451
Put your hands here
and get them wet.

00:13:07.412 --> 00:13:11.708
Just let the clay
slide between your fingers.

00:13:11.791 --> 00:13:15.545
· Godspeed your love ·

00:13:15.586 --> 00:13:20.883
· To me ·

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:29.517
· Lonely rivers flow ·

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.477
· To the sea ·

00:13:31.602 --> 00:13:33.730
· To the sea ·

00:13:33.771 --> 00:13:36.774
· To the open arms ·

00:13:36.899 --> 00:13:39.193
· Of the sea ·

00:13:39.277 --> 00:13:40.945
· Yeah ·

00:13:41.279 --> 00:13:44.240
· Lonely rivers sigh ·

00:13:44.407 --> 00:13:45.867
· Wait for me ·

00:13:45.992 --> 00:13:48.369
· Wait for me ·

00:13:48.453 --> 00:13:51.456
· I'll be comin'home ·

00:13:51.539 --> 00:13:55.626
· Wait for me ·

00:13:55.793 --> 00:13:58.212
· Oh ·

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:02.759
· My love ·

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:06.429
· My darlin'·

00:14:06.554 --> 00:14:08.556
· I've hungered ·

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:13.770
· Hungered for your touch ·

00:14:13.895 --> 00:14:16.856
· A long ·

00:14:16.981 --> 00:14:20.777
· Lonely time ·

00:14:24.739 --> 00:14:28.409
· And time ·

00:14:28.493 --> 00:14:31.871
· Goes by ·

00:14:31.996 --> 00:14:35.792
· So slowly ·

00:14:35.833 --> 00:14:37.835
· And time ·

00:14:37.877 --> 00:14:42.465
· Can do so much ·

00:14:42.507 --> 00:14:46.302
· Are you ·

00:14:46.427 --> 00:14:52.558
· Still mine ·

00:14:53.684 --> 00:14:57.563
· I need ·

00:14:57.688 --> 00:15:00.942
· Your love ·

00:15:01.025 --> 00:15:04.320
· I ·

00:15:04.445 --> 00:15:08.199
· I need your love ·

00:15:08.324 --> 00:15:11.994
· Godspeed your love ·

00:15:12.245 --> 00:15:18.543
· To me ··

00:16:04.589 --> 00:16:05.965
Oh, no.

00:16:07.592 --> 00:16:08.926
What's the matter?

00:16:10.636 --> 00:16:11.971
A glitch.
What's up?

00:16:12.096 --> 00:16:14.974
The Greenberg and White accounts--
I can't get in.

00:16:15.099 --> 00:16:16.392
The Mac code
isn't working.

00:16:16.517 --> 00:16:17.727
Oh, I changed it.

00:16:17.768 --> 00:16:18.728
Why?

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:21.439
Nothing. I want to
nose around a bit.

00:16:21.564 --> 00:16:22.899
Is something wrong?

00:16:24.025 --> 00:16:25.735
Can you keep a secret?

00:16:27.778 --> 00:16:29.488
Yeah, sure.

00:16:29.614 --> 00:16:30.740
What's up?

00:16:30.907 --> 00:16:33.367
There's too much money
in these accounts.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.453
Too much money?
That's impossible.

00:16:41.167 --> 00:16:43.920
Sam, this is going
to take you hours.

00:16:44.045 --> 00:16:45.546
Let me do this.

00:16:45.630 --> 00:16:46.964
It's already
taken me hours.

00:16:47.048 --> 00:16:48.549
Let me figure it out.

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:49.967
No, that's OK.

00:16:50.051 --> 00:16:51.969
It's like
a vendetta now.

00:16:52.053 --> 00:16:53.971
Thanks, though.
I appreciate it.

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.097
OK.

00:16:55.181 --> 00:16:58.142
If you start to go blind,
give a shout.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.645
OK. Adios.

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:03.981
Listen, what are you
and Moll doing tonight?

00:17:04.148 --> 00:17:07.026
We're going to the theater
to see Macbeth.

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:09.111
She likes
the guys in tights.

00:17:09.403 --> 00:17:10.738
You want to go?

00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:11.864
No, thanks.

00:17:11.989 --> 00:17:13.616
I want a full
report, though.

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:14.784
Later.

00:17:14.825 --> 00:17:15.910
Yeah.

00:17:21.540 --> 00:17:22.875
Well, I loved it.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.461
I was spellbound
the whole time.

00:17:25.544 --> 00:17:26.879
I could tell.

00:17:27.004 --> 00:17:28.464
So could
everyone else

00:17:28.547 --> 00:17:31.050
with that resonating
snore of yours.

00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:38.641
Did I tell you
what Melissa said?

00:17:38.724 --> 00:17:40.059
Yeah, about six times.

00:17:40.184 --> 00:17:41.644
It wasn't six times.

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:44.063
Quit being
so blase about this.

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:45.648
This is really
important.

00:17:45.731 --> 00:17:48.067
I'll have two pieces
in her gallery.

00:17:48.192 --> 00:17:52.113
The New York Times
reviews her gallery all the time.

00:17:52.196 --> 00:17:53.698
Molly,
The New York Times

00:17:53.781 --> 00:17:55.700
is just some
frustrated little critic

00:17:55.783 --> 00:17:59.036
with pimples on his ass
who flunked art school.

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.496
Who cares what they think?

00:18:00.621 --> 00:18:02.957
About eight million
readers, that's who.

00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:06.836
Nah, they're just
reading the sports page.

00:18:06.961 --> 00:18:08.879
Your work
is really beautiful.

00:18:09.005 --> 00:18:10.464
It really is.

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:11.590
Thanks.

00:18:11.716 --> 00:18:14.010
It shouldn't matter
what anyone else thinks,

00:18:14.135 --> 00:18:15.594
just what I think.

00:18:20.683 --> 00:18:23.019
I want
to marry you, Sam.

00:18:23.102 --> 00:18:24.437
What?

00:18:24.562 --> 00:18:26.814
What?

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:28.482
Yep.

00:18:28.566 --> 00:18:30.860
I've been
thinking about it.

00:18:30.901 --> 00:18:33.404
I've been thinking
about it a lot,

00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:36.657
and I think we
should just do it.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:38.534
You're serious.

00:18:38.576 --> 00:18:39.994
Yeah.

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.541
What's that look for?

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:53.591
You never wanted
to talk about it.

00:19:02.767 --> 00:19:05.061
Do you love me, Sam?

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:08.189
Well, what do you think?

00:19:08.439 --> 00:19:10.232
Why don't you
ever say it?

00:19:10.441 --> 00:19:13.778
What do you mean?
I say it all the time.

00:19:13.903 --> 00:19:15.237
No, you say ''ditto,''

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:17.573
and that's
not the same.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.119
People say I love you
all the time,

00:19:22.203 --> 00:19:24.622
and it doesn't
mean anything.

00:19:26.749 --> 00:19:30.127
You know, sometimes
you need to hear it.

00:19:31.504 --> 00:19:33.255
I need to hear it.

00:19:35.049 --> 00:19:36.092
Let's go.

00:19:44.767 --> 00:19:46.102
What should we do?

00:19:46.143 --> 00:19:47.645
Let me handle it.

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:49.105
What do you want?

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:51.148
Your wallet--
give it to me!

00:19:51.232 --> 00:19:54.276
Sam, just give it to him.

00:19:55.903 --> 00:19:58.989
OK, just take the money.
Just leave--

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:00.825
No, Sam--

00:20:00.908 --> 00:20:02.827
You son of a bitch!

00:20:05.079 --> 00:20:06.831
Sam, don't!

00:20:08.165 --> 00:20:09.625
Somebody help us!

00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:11.794
Jesus Christ, Sam!

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.630
Just get off him.

00:20:14.755 --> 00:20:16.340
Somebody!

00:20:16.632 --> 00:20:18.300
Somebody help us!

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.177
Sam, just let...

00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:23.180
Sam, stop it.

00:20:23.347 --> 00:20:24.807
Stop it, Sam!

00:20:24.932 --> 00:20:26.642
[Gunshot]

00:20:45.077 --> 00:20:46.245
Molly?

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.249
Molly, he got--

00:20:57.047 --> 00:20:58.215
Sam...

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:04.889
Baby, hold on.

00:21:05.014 --> 00:21:06.932
You're going
to be OK.

00:21:09.101 --> 00:21:10.352
Somebody?

00:21:10.644 --> 00:21:12.188
Somebody?

00:21:12.313 --> 00:21:14.190
Somebody help us!

00:21:14.273 --> 00:21:15.691
Oh, Sam.

00:21:17.693 --> 00:21:19.028
Oh, my God.

00:21:19.111 --> 00:21:21.030
Oh, Sam, come on.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:22.698
Hold on, baby.

00:21:22.781 --> 00:21:25.075
Someone's going to come.

00:21:25.159 --> 00:21:27.786
You're going to be OK.

00:21:37.713 --> 00:21:39.298
Somebody!

00:21:39.381 --> 00:21:42.051
Somebody help me!

00:21:42.176 --> 00:21:44.178
Please, anybody!

00:21:44.303 --> 00:21:46.263
Help me. Please help me.

00:21:46.388 --> 00:21:48.349
Take it easy, all right?

00:21:49.975 --> 00:21:51.310
We'll help you, OK?

00:21:51.393 --> 00:21:54.021
Molly? Molly?

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:55.231
Molly?

00:21:58.359 --> 00:21:59.360
OK.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:00.903
All right.
All right.

00:22:00.986 --> 00:22:02.196
Molly?

00:22:02.321 --> 00:22:03.781
What should we do?

00:22:03.906 --> 00:22:04.907
Aah!

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:08.160
Aah!

00:22:08.285 --> 00:22:11.455
Aah!

00:22:13.123 --> 00:22:15.000
What's happening?

00:22:16.126 --> 00:22:17.711
What's...

00:22:17.836 --> 00:22:19.004
Is he breathing?

00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:24.969
I don't know
if he's breathing.

00:22:26.053 --> 00:22:28.472
Don't die, Sam.
Hold on.

00:22:28.722 --> 00:22:30.766
Hold on, baby.
Hold on.

00:22:30.849 --> 00:22:32.184
Oh, my God.

00:22:48.993 --> 00:22:50.828
Come on, man.

00:22:50.953 --> 00:22:52.246
All right.

00:22:52.329 --> 00:22:54.540
Here we go.

00:22:54.790 --> 00:22:56.375
1 ...

00:22:56.458 --> 00:22:58.335
Come on, baby.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:00.921
Sam, don't you leave me.

00:23:01.005 --> 00:23:02.464
Sam, hold on!

00:23:03.716 --> 00:23:04.925
Sam...

00:23:05.009 --> 00:23:06.176
Oh, Sam...

00:23:08.429 --> 00:23:09.763
Jesus...

00:23:56.477 --> 00:23:59.355

It's Molly.

00:49:13.242 --> 00:49:14.743
Molly?

00:49:17.413 --> 00:49:19.790
I'm Oda Mae Brown.

00:49:23.919 --> 00:49:25.713
I don't know you or Sam,

00:49:25.838 --> 00:49:28.340
but let me tell you
what he did.

00:49:28.424 --> 00:49:30.342
He kept me up all night

00:49:30.426 --> 00:49:32.011
singing I'm Henry
The Eighth, I Am.

00:49:32.094 --> 00:49:35.764
That's how he got me
to go out with him.

00:49:35.890 --> 00:49:37.057
Look, I'm sorry.

00:49:37.391 --> 00:49:39.268
I just--
I just don't believe

00:49:39.393 --> 00:49:42.479
in this life
after death stuff.

00:49:42.563 --> 00:49:43.898
Well, tell her
she's wrong.

00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:46.525
He says
you're wrong.

00:49:46.609 --> 00:49:48.527
You're talking to him
right now?

00:49:48.611 --> 00:49:51.822
He just asked me to tell you
that you're wrong.

00:49:51.947 --> 00:49:53.407
So where is he?

00:49:53.532 --> 00:49:56.911
I can't see him.
I can only hear him.

00:49:56.994 --> 00:49:59.413
I'm right here.

00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:01.749
That doesn't help,
Sam.

00:50:01.832 --> 00:50:04.877
I'm holding
her hand.

00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.087
He says he's
holding your hand.

00:50:17.139 --> 00:50:18.432
What are you doing?

00:50:18.724 --> 00:50:22.436
What do you think
you're doing to me?

00:50:22.561 --> 00:50:25.814
If you think I'm here for
my health, you're crazy.

00:50:25.981 --> 00:50:28.817
Sam's dead, OK?
He's dead.

00:50:28.943 --> 00:50:30.819
Tell her
I love her.

00:50:30.945 --> 00:50:32.863
He says
he loves you.

00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:36.951
Sam would
never say that.

00:50:37.034 --> 00:50:37.952
Say ditto.

00:50:38.035 --> 00:50:39.536
What the hell
is ditto?

00:50:39.662 --> 00:50:40.788
Ditto!

00:51:10.025 --> 00:51:11.777
To tell you
the truth,

00:51:11.860 --> 00:51:14.154
I don't know how
I'm doing this.

00:51:14.446 --> 00:51:15.781
Confidentially,
nothing like this

00:51:15.864 --> 00:51:17.783
has ever happened
to me before.

00:51:17.866 --> 00:51:19.201
I mean, nothing.

00:51:19.493 --> 00:51:21.203
Now I can't
turn it off.

00:51:23.580 --> 00:51:25.624
Is this him?
Is this you?

00:51:25.749 --> 00:51:26.667
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:28.502
Huh. Cute.

00:51:28.627 --> 00:51:30.129
White,
but cute.

00:51:30.296 --> 00:51:32.715
What I don't
understand is,

00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:34.508
why did he come back?

00:51:34.675 --> 00:51:36.010
I don't know.

00:51:36.051 --> 00:51:37.511
Why is he
still here?

00:51:37.678 --> 00:51:39.555
He's stuck,
that's what it is.

00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.015
He's in between
worlds.

00:51:41.056 --> 00:51:42.599
You know,
it happens sometimes

00:51:42.725 --> 00:51:45.019
that the spirit gets
yanked out so quick

00:51:45.102 --> 00:51:46.603
that the essence
still feels

00:51:46.729 --> 00:51:48.022
it has work to do.

00:51:48.105 --> 00:51:49.523
Would you stop rambling?

00:51:49.648 --> 00:51:50.941
I'm just answering
her question.

00:51:51.066 --> 00:51:52.526
He's got
an attitude now.

00:51:52.651 --> 00:51:54.653
I don't have an attitude.

00:51:54.778 --> 00:51:56.697
Yes, you do
have an attitude.

00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:58.032
We're having
a little discussion.

00:51:58.157 --> 00:51:59.950
If you didn't have
a attitude,

00:52:00.075 --> 00:52:01.827
you wouldn't have
raised your voice.

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:03.412
God damn it,
Oda Mae--

00:52:03.579 --> 00:52:04.830
Don't you god damn me.

00:52:04.955 --> 00:52:07.166
Don't you take
the Lord's name in vain.

00:52:07.249 --> 00:52:08.625
Would you relax?

00:52:08.751 --> 00:52:10.627
You relax.
You're the dead guy.

00:52:10.753 --> 00:52:12.629
Want me to help?
You apologize.

00:52:12.755 --> 00:52:13.630
Jesus Christ!

00:52:13.756 --> 00:52:14.798
I'm leaving.

00:52:14.923 --> 00:52:17.217
Nobody talks to me like that,
you understand?

00:52:17.259 --> 00:52:18.761
Now, you better
apologize.

00:52:18.886 --> 00:52:20.220
I'm sorry.

00:52:20.262 --> 00:52:21.221
I apologize.

00:52:21.263 --> 00:52:22.848
OK?

00:52:22.931 --> 00:52:25.726
Now, would you
sit down?

00:52:25.809 --> 00:52:26.727
Please?

00:52:26.810 --> 00:52:28.937
He's apologized.

00:52:30.147 --> 00:52:33.067
I need you to tell
Molly what I'm saying,

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:36.070
but you have to tell her
word for word.

00:52:36.195 --> 00:52:39.656
Yes. He wants me to tell you
what he's saying

00:52:39.782 --> 00:52:41.867
word for word.

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:48.123
Molly, you're in danger.

00:52:48.248 --> 00:52:51.126
You can't just
blurt it out like that.

00:52:51.251 --> 00:52:52.920
And quit moving around,
will you?

00:52:53.045 --> 00:52:54.546
You're making me dizzy.

00:52:54.630 --> 00:52:57.049
I'll just tell her
in my own way.

00:52:57.174 --> 00:53:00.677
Molly, you in danger,
girl.

00:53:00.803 --> 00:53:02.721
What are you
talking about?

00:53:02.805 --> 00:53:04.890
I know the man
who killed me.

00:53:04.973 --> 00:53:06.517
He knows
who killed him.

00:53:06.642 --> 00:53:09.186
His name's Willy Lopez.
I know where he lives.

00:53:09.311 --> 00:53:11.230
He's a Puerto Rican,
Willy Lopez.

00:53:11.313 --> 00:53:12.773
He knows
where he lives.

00:53:12.815 --> 00:53:13.774
Write it down.

00:53:13.816 --> 00:53:15.150
You write it down.

00:53:15.275 --> 00:53:16.735
I ain't no
damn secretary.

00:53:16.819 --> 00:53:17.778
Just do it!

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.196
Argh!

00:53:19.321 --> 00:53:21.740
He's so testy.

00:53:21.824 --> 00:53:24.785
What is it you
want me to write?

00:53:24.868 --> 00:53:27.663
It's 303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

00:53:27.788 --> 00:53:29.123
303 Prospect Place?

00:53:29.164 --> 00:53:30.124
Yeah.

00:53:30.207 --> 00:53:32.251
That's my
neighborhood.

00:53:32.334 --> 00:53:34.294
Molly, he's got
my wallet,

00:53:34.336 --> 00:53:35.838
he's got my key,

00:53:35.963 --> 00:53:37.297
and he was
in here.

00:53:37.339 --> 00:53:40.717
He's got his wallet
and key and was here.

00:53:40.843 --> 00:53:42.719
Yesterday after your
walk with Carl,

00:53:42.845 --> 00:53:45.139
you talked to Floyd,
took off your clothes--

00:53:45.264 --> 00:53:46.723
All right,
all right.

00:53:46.849 --> 00:53:49.059
When you came in
after your walk with Carl,

00:53:49.184 --> 00:53:51.103
he saw
everything.

00:53:51.186 --> 00:53:53.647
Go to the police.
It was a setup.

00:53:53.772 --> 00:53:55.691
I was murdered.

00:53:55.816 --> 00:53:58.777
He says go to the police.
He was murdered.

00:53:58.861 --> 00:54:00.112
There's somebody
else involved--

00:54:00.195 --> 00:54:02.990
I don't want no more
to do with this.

00:54:03.115 --> 00:54:04.616
Where are you going?

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:07.661
I'm leaving, I did everything
I said I'd do.

00:54:07.703 --> 00:54:09.788
And don't be
following me.

00:54:09.872 --> 00:54:11.790
I'm finished.
I mean it.

00:54:11.874 --> 00:54:14.168
Have a nice life.
Have a nice death.

00:54:14.293 --> 00:54:15.294
Goodbye.

00:54:18.005 --> 00:54:20.340
Molly, there is no one
on earth besides you

00:54:20.632 --> 00:54:23.760
who wants this
to be true more than me,

00:54:23.886 --> 00:54:26.138
but you got to be
rational about this.

00:54:26.221 --> 00:54:29.308
Sam is no more
in this room than--

00:54:29.391 --> 00:54:34.980
Look, I understand the
need to hang on to him,

00:54:35.105 --> 00:54:38.066
I really do,
but this is absurd.

00:54:38.192 --> 00:54:42.154
I know this seems absurd,
but it had to be real.

00:54:42.279 --> 00:54:44.198
You believed some
fortune-teller from Brooklyn

00:54:44.281 --> 00:54:46.283
who shows up
at your door?

00:54:46.408 --> 00:54:49.286
I watched her have
a conversation with him.

00:54:49.411 --> 00:54:51.663
I don't buy it, Moll,
not for a minute.

00:54:51.788 --> 00:54:53.957
What about the things
she knew?

00:54:54.082 --> 00:54:55.667
What things?

00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:59.379
The photo Sam took of me
on our trip to Reno.

00:54:59.671 --> 00:55:01.256
Carl, we were alone.

00:55:01.381 --> 00:55:04.843
And the green underwear
that I wrote my name in.

00:55:08.055 --> 00:55:10.599
She said Sam knew
who killed him.

00:55:10.766 --> 00:55:14.019
Yeah, that he
was set up.

00:55:14.061 --> 00:55:16.063
This is getting
deranged.

00:55:16.104 --> 00:55:17.606
We're off
the deep end.

00:55:17.731 --> 00:55:19.900
She had a name
and an address--

00:55:19.942 --> 00:55:20.901
Willy Lopez.

00:55:20.943 --> 00:55:23.278
303 Prospect Place,
apartment 4-D.

00:55:24.821 --> 00:55:26.156
This is sick.

00:55:26.281 --> 00:55:27.741
Oh, Carl.

00:55:27.908 --> 00:55:29.826
This is really sick.

00:55:30.953 --> 00:55:31.912
Oh, God.

00:55:32.037 --> 00:55:33.372
Molly, I don't
understand

00:55:33.455 --> 00:55:35.374
how you could--
you could...

00:55:38.043 --> 00:55:39.920
swallow this crap.
I mean...

00:55:40.045 --> 00:55:42.381
this guy
may not even exist.

00:55:42.464 --> 00:55:45.425
Maybe she's just
trying to use you

00:55:45.509 --> 00:55:48.053
to set someone up.

00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:50.180
You're right.

00:55:50.305 --> 00:55:51.765
You're absolutely right.

00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:54.768
That's what
I got to find out.

00:55:54.893 --> 00:55:57.229
What do you mean,
find out?

00:55:57.354 --> 00:56:00.399
She said Sam wants me
to go to the police.

00:56:00.732 --> 00:56:03.068
Sam wants you to
go to the police?

00:56:03.151 --> 00:56:05.946
Jesus, Moll. Are you
out of your mind?

00:56:05.988 --> 00:56:08.323
What are you going
to tell the police?

00:56:08.448 --> 00:56:09.908
That some
storefront psychic

00:56:09.992 --> 00:56:12.327
has been communing
with the dead?

00:56:12.452 --> 00:56:14.913
Do you know what
that sounds like?

00:56:14.997 --> 00:56:17.332
You're talking ghosts here,
for Christ's sake.

00:56:19.126 --> 00:56:20.043
I'm sorry.

00:56:20.127 --> 00:56:22.921
This stuff just really
gets to me,

00:56:23.005 --> 00:56:23.922
you know?

00:56:24.006 --> 00:56:26.300
It's OK if you
don't believe me.

00:56:26.425 --> 00:56:27.926
I'm trying to, Molly.

00:56:31.513 --> 00:56:33.098
Look...

00:56:33.223 --> 00:56:36.143
if it'll make you
feel any better,

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:40.355
I'll go check
this out, OK?

00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:43.358
I want you to try
and get some sleep.

00:56:43.483 --> 00:56:44.359
OK?

00:56:44.484 --> 00:56:46.320
All right.

00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:49.364
I'll call you
in the morning.

00:56:49.489 --> 00:56:50.365
OK.

00:57:18.393 --> 00:57:19.478
Be careful.

00:57:29.905 --> 00:57:31.782
[Knock Knock]

00:57:33.408 --> 00:57:34.326
Carl.

00:57:34.409 --> 00:57:37.329
What the hell
are you doing here?

00:57:38.622 --> 00:57:40.540
Who you been
talking to, Willy?

00:57:40.624 --> 00:57:43.043
''Talking to''?
What the hell do you mean?

00:57:43.210 --> 00:57:45.379
Some woman knows
all about you, everything.

00:57:45.462 --> 00:57:47.381
Where's she
getting it from?

00:57:47.464 --> 00:57:49.966
I haven't said
a word to anybody.

00:57:50.092 --> 00:57:52.386
She knows your name
and where you live.

00:57:52.469 --> 00:57:54.930
A lot of women
know where I live.

00:57:55.055 --> 00:57:56.932
This is not a joke.

00:57:57.057 --> 00:57:58.975
She knows
about the murder.

00:57:59.101 --> 00:58:01.395
I want you
to find this bitch,

00:58:01.478 --> 00:58:02.979
whoever she is,

00:58:03.105 --> 00:58:04.981
and I want you to--

00:58:06.942 --> 00:58:09.236
Just get rid
of her, OK?

00:58:09.319 --> 00:58:13.824
I've got $4 million stuck
in a god damn computer.

00:58:13.949 --> 00:58:16.243
If I don't get
those codes,

00:58:16.368 --> 00:58:19.246
if that money is not
transferred soon...

00:58:21.957 --> 00:58:23.458
I'm...

00:58:23.583 --> 00:58:24.543
dead.

00:58:24.626 --> 00:58:26.128
We're both dead.

00:58:26.253 --> 00:58:28.505
Why not tell them
you only launder money

00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:30.090
the first of the month?

00:58:30.173 --> 00:58:32.008
What the hell
is wrong with you?

00:58:32.134 --> 00:58:34.469
Is everything a joke?

00:58:34.636 --> 00:58:36.263
You killed a man.

00:58:36.430 --> 00:58:37.389
You were supposed
to steal his wallet.

00:58:37.556 --> 00:58:39.975
-Was that a joke?
-I did you a favor.

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.435
That was a freebie.

00:58:42.644 --> 00:58:45.856
Look, these are
drug dealers, OK?

00:58:45.981 --> 00:58:48.316
Just don't blow this
for me.

00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:51.278
I've risked my job.
I could go to jail.

00:58:51.361 --> 00:58:54.531
$80,000 of that money
is mine.

00:58:57.909 --> 00:58:59.119
Look, just...

00:58:59.244 --> 00:59:01.913
let me have the key
to Sam's apartment.

00:59:01.997 --> 00:59:04.583
I'll get the address book
myself, OK?

00:59:30.484 --> 00:59:32.944
You god damn bastard!

00:59:33.028 --> 00:59:34.029
Why?

00:59:34.154 --> 00:59:36.573
Why? You were
my friend!

00:59:38.992 --> 00:59:41.328
I had a life,
god damn you.

00:59:41.495 --> 00:59:43.163
I had a life!

00:59:52.214 --> 00:59:55.467
Look, I don't even believe
in this stuff myself.

00:59:55.550 --> 00:59:57.010
But she was real.

00:59:57.135 --> 01:00:00.722
You think I'd come down here
if it wasn't real?

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:02.724
You know,

01:00:03.183 --> 01:00:06.478
you told me if I had
any new information

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:08.063
that I should come.

01:00:08.146 --> 01:00:09.481
So here I am.

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:15.570
I know
how this sounds.

01:00:15.654 --> 01:00:17.572
I hear myself
saying it,

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:19.574
and I want
to cringe.

01:00:19.658 --> 01:00:22.619
But this woman knew things
she couldn't have known.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:25.163
Things Sam
only said to me.

01:00:25.330 --> 01:00:28.333
OK, according to this
psychic lady,

01:00:28.458 --> 01:00:32.796
there are ghosts and spirits
all over the place

01:00:33.046 --> 01:00:34.798
watching us
all the time?

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:35.799
Huh?

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:41.513
Hell, I'm never going
to get undressed again.

01:00:41.555 --> 01:00:42.514
Excuse me.

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:45.517
I got more
important things to do.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.697
The guy's name
is Willy Lopez.

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:02.158
All I'm asking you to do
is check it out.

01:01:02.284 --> 01:01:03.618
OK. Wait here.

01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:07.414
Let me see if the guy's
got a record, all right?

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:09.249
Great.

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.313
What are you doing?

01:02:13.438 --> 01:02:15.440
Where's the file
on Willy Lopez?

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.067
There isn't one.

01:02:17.150 --> 01:02:19.069
He was probably
some old boyfriend

01:02:19.152 --> 01:02:21.488
she was trying
to get even with.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.490
This psychic woman's
got a record

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:26.076

a long way.

this is impossible.

01:02:44.177 --> 01:02:46.346
It goes on and on.

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:48.348
She knew things,
private things.

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:50.850
Now, how could she
have known all that?

01:02:50.976 --> 01:02:53.478
A lot of times
they read the obits.

01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.815
She just had to see
the word ''banker''--boom.

01:02:56.856 --> 01:02:59.317
Hell, they even go
through your...garbage

they can use--

01:03:01.528 --> 01:03:02.862
letters, old papers.

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:04.447
It doesn't take much.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:06.449
No.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:10.161
It was real.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:14.833
She knew about a...

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:16.459
a sweater I knitted.

01:03:18.586 --> 01:03:19.879

I'm sorry.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:33.351
I know this is hard.

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:35.770
People want so much
to believe.

01:03:35.895 --> 01:03:36.771
They're grieving,

01:03:36.896 --> 01:03:38.231
they're vulnerable...

01:03:39.566 --> 01:03:41.693

give anything

what they're doing.

Let me know what
you want me to do.

Yeah. I'll do that.

but I didn't have time.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:04.849
I went to the police.

01:09:11.230 --> 01:09:12.190
You did?

01:09:12.523 --> 01:09:14.400
Wow. What
did you tell them?

01:09:14.525 --> 01:09:15.818
What did they say?

01:09:15.902 --> 01:09:17.403
It was awful.

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.615
I felt really stupid.

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:24.035
They brought out a file
on this woman and--

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:26.037
At least
1 0 inches thick.

01:09:27.163 --> 01:09:28.748
A ripoff artist, huh?

01:09:28.873 --> 01:09:29.916
No, Molly.

01:09:31.751 --> 01:09:33.628
You know,
the sad thing...

01:09:35.254 --> 01:09:37.215
is that
I believed her.

01:09:37.298 --> 01:09:38.758
Molly...

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.887
sometimes
we need to believe.

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:45.848
Why? What's the point?

01:09:45.932 --> 01:09:47.308
Molly, it's not easy to face
the realities of life sometimes.

01:09:49.769 --> 01:09:51.813
You got to
give yourself that.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:56.651
What you've got to remember
is the love that you guys felt.

01:09:56.776 --> 01:09:59.112
You got to remember
how good Sam was.

01:09:59.153 --> 01:10:01.656
You were everything
to him, Molly.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:03.116
You were his life.

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.215
I feel so alone.

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:29.267
You're not alone.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:30.268
OK?

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:34.021
You got your work.
You're incredibly talented.

01:10:34.147 --> 01:10:35.064
You're young.

01:10:35.148 --> 01:10:37.358
You're fantastically
gorgeous.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:41.404
I don't know
what's real anymore.

01:10:42.655 --> 01:10:45.158
I don't know
what to think.

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:50.079
Just think about Sam.

01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:55.626
Think about the time
you guys had together.

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:58.671
How wonderful that was.

01:10:59.922 --> 01:11:01.048
Yeah.

01:11:02.258 --> 01:11:05.178
Let your feelings out,
Moll. It's OK.

01:11:05.344 --> 01:11:07.763
Life turns on a dime.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:10.266
You know?

01:11:11.976 --> 01:11:12.977
I mean...

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:15.646
people think that...

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:18.816
they're there forever, that there's
always going to be tomorrow,

01:11:18.941 --> 01:11:20.234
but that's bullshit.

01:11:20.359 --> 01:11:22.320
Sam taught us that.

01:11:23.821 --> 01:11:26.157
You have to
live for now.

01:11:28.784 --> 01:11:29.911
For today.

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:50.890
I can't.

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:51.891
I'm sorry.

01:11:52.016 --> 01:11:52.892
It's OK.

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.728
I--I--I can't.
It's just too soon.

01:11:55.811 --> 01:11:56.729
It's OK.

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:58.731
You've been great,
Carl.

01:12:01.734 --> 01:12:03.694
But I need you
to leave.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:05.071
I understand totally.

01:12:05.196 --> 01:12:06.072
Please.

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:14.997
Could we just have dinner
tomorrow night? Just talk?

01:12:15.081 --> 01:12:17.416
Can I interest you
in that?

01:12:18.793 --> 01:12:19.835
Yeah.

01:12:19.919 --> 01:12:20.836
Sure.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:21.837
Great.

01:13:30.156 --> 01:13:31.032
Hey.

01:13:35.786 --> 01:13:38.122
Get off my train!

01:13:38.205 --> 01:13:39.123
No.

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:41.000
Get off!

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:42.084
Get off!

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:43.002
Get off!

01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:44.337
Get off!

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:45.838
Get off!

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:47.048
Get out of here!

01:13:47.173 --> 01:13:48.174
Get off!

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:49.216
No.

01:13:49.342 --> 01:13:51.218
Show me
how you do that.

01:13:51.344 --> 01:13:53.554
I'm not leaving
till you teach me.

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:54.805
Get off!

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:55.973
No.

01:13:56.057 --> 01:13:56.974
Get off!

01:14:04.023 --> 01:14:06.484
You stubborn asshole.

01:14:06.567 --> 01:14:08.069
Ha ha ha.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:09.528
What are you doing?

01:14:09.570 --> 01:14:11.530
What the hell
are you doing?

01:14:11.572 --> 01:14:13.074
What am I doing?

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.534
You're trying to move it
with your finger.

01:14:15.576 --> 01:14:17.912
You can't push it.
You're dead.

01:14:26.420 --> 01:14:28.381
It's all in your mind.

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:31.926
The problem with you
is you still think you're real.

01:14:32.051 --> 01:14:33.928
You think you're
wearing those clothes?

01:14:34.053 --> 01:14:36.263
You think you're crouched
on that floor?

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:37.264
Bullshit!

01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:39.850
You ain't got a body
no more, son!

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.310
It's all up here!

01:14:41.394 --> 01:14:42.895
You want
to move something,

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:45.314
you got to move it
with your mind!

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:46.899
You got to focus!

01:14:46.982 --> 01:14:48.901
How? How do you focus?

01:14:48.984 --> 01:14:51.404
I don't know
how you focus.

01:14:51.529 --> 01:14:53.030
You just focus.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:58.077
How did you do that?

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:00.413
You got to take
all your emotions,

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:03.207
all your anger, all your love,
all your hate,

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:04.583
and push it way down

01:15:04.875 --> 01:15:06.460
into the pit
of your stomach

01:15:06.585 --> 01:15:09.046
and let it explode
like a reactor. Pow!

01:15:11.298 --> 01:15:12.258
OK.

01:15:12.341 --> 01:15:13.259
OK.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:19.849
Don't laugh.

01:15:44.582 --> 01:15:46.125
Way to go, kid.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.626
I did it.

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:50.921
I did it.

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:52.339
Way to go.

01:15:59.346 --> 01:16:02.224
From your gut,
like I told you.

01:16:05.186 --> 01:16:08.147
Give it time.
What else have you got?

01:16:15.654 --> 01:16:18.115
How long
have you been here?

01:16:20.326 --> 01:16:22.453
Since they pushed me.

01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.121
Someone pushed you?

01:16:24.205 --> 01:16:25.456
Yeah, someone pushed me.

01:16:25.539 --> 01:16:26.957
Who?

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:28.334
You don't believe me?

01:16:28.459 --> 01:16:31.337
You think I fell?
You think I jumped?

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.880
Well, fuck you!

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:34.507
It wasn't my time!

01:16:34.673 --> 01:16:36.550
I wasn't supposed to go!

01:16:36.675 --> 01:16:39.136
I'm not supposed
to be here!

01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:43.349
Oh.

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:45.935
Oh.

01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:52.399
Oh, I'd give anything
for a drag.

01:16:52.525 --> 01:16:54.693
Just one drag.

01:16:55.027 --> 01:16:56.570
Are you all right?

01:16:56.695 --> 01:16:59.323
Who are you?
Why are you hounding me?

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:01.408
Who sent you?

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:05.287
Who sent you?

01:17:07.456 --> 01:17:08.999
Leave me alone.

01:17:09.124 --> 01:17:10.459
Leave me alone!

01:17:10.543 --> 01:17:12.670
Leave me alone!

01:17:56.255 --> 01:17:57.256
Yes!

01:18:12.605 --> 01:18:14.106
You need
to concentrate,

01:18:14.189 --> 01:18:15.524
'cause if
you concentrate,

01:18:15.608 --> 01:18:17.109
you'll probably
rouse him.

01:18:17.192 --> 01:18:18.527
What's his name
again?

01:18:18.611 --> 01:18:19.528
Orlando.

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:20.613
Orlando.

01:18:20.738 --> 01:18:23.574
Orlando. Orlando.
Is there an Orlando here?

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:24.575
I'm here.

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:25.576
He's here.

01:18:25.659 --> 01:18:26.994
Oda Mae, I--

01:18:27.119 --> 01:18:27.995
Sam.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:29.455
Excuse me.
I'm Orlando.

01:18:29.496 --> 01:18:30.998
The line's
over there.

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.000
Where did these ghosts
come from?

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.460
You can hear them, too?

01:18:34.543 --> 01:18:37.463
I hear them in the morning
and the evening.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.173
They're coming
into the shower.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:42.301
Did you tell every spook
you met about me?

01:18:42.384 --> 01:18:45.095
I got spooks from Jersey
coming in here.

01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.765
There's stuff going on
you wouldn't believe.

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.808
It's amazing.
You're really doing it.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:50.851
I know.

01:18:51.101 --> 01:18:52.770
Can you
hurry this up?

01:18:52.853 --> 01:18:55.105
Oh, chill out.
Chill out.

01:18:55.189 --> 01:18:56.523
I need your help.

01:18:56.607 --> 01:18:58.525
There's something
we need to do.

01:18:58.651 --> 01:19:00.986
I'm not doing anything
else with you, Sam.

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:02.988
You're holding on
to a life

01:19:03.113 --> 01:19:04.490
that doesn't
want you anymore.

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:06.742
It doesn't want you.
Give up the ghost.

01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:08.786
Are you speaking
to me?

01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:10.788
Does it look like it?

01:19:10.829 --> 01:19:13.457
You're supposed to be
concentrating, aren't you?

01:19:13.624 --> 01:19:15.125
You going to try it?

01:19:15.167 --> 01:19:16.377
Thank you very much.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:18.837
Sam, are you going
to get out of here?

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:19.838
Uh-uh.

01:19:20.089 --> 01:19:21.423
Fine, then stay there.

01:19:21.507 --> 01:19:22.424
Excuse me.

01:19:22.508 --> 01:19:23.425
Excuse me.

01:19:23.509 --> 01:19:24.802
You ready now?

01:19:24.885 --> 01:19:26.345
Let's do it.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.806
I got to talk
to you now.

01:19:28.889 --> 01:19:30.349
I've got a plan.

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:34.103
All we got to do
is we can...

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:35.312
Oda Mae?

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:43.529
Oda Mae.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.199
Ortisha?

01:19:48.617 --> 01:19:50.577
Orlando. Is that you?

01:19:50.661 --> 01:19:53.622
Ortisha, where you at?
I can't hardly see.

01:19:53.706 --> 01:19:54.581
Here.
Sh-She's here.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:58.127
In front of you.
I'm right here.

01:20:01.672 --> 01:20:04.925
Damn, baby, what did
you do to your hair?

01:20:07.177 --> 01:20:08.595
Orlando, you like it?

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:11.223
It's autumn sunrise.

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:17.229
Get out of me,
you son of a bitch.

01:20:20.357 --> 01:20:22.943
Don't you ever do that
to me again.

01:20:23.193 --> 01:20:24.319
Orlando?

01:20:24.445 --> 01:20:25.779
Ugh!

01:20:25.904 --> 01:20:28.365
I can barely move.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:30.284
You should know
better than that.

01:20:30.409 --> 01:20:32.411
Jumping into bodies
wipes you out.

01:20:32.578 --> 01:20:33.454
Everybody out.

01:20:33.579 --> 01:20:34.872
What happened
to Orlando?

01:20:34.955 --> 01:20:37.499
Where's
the insurance policy?

01:20:37.583 --> 01:20:38.917
Are you deaf?

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:41.420
I said everybody out!

01:20:41.503 --> 01:20:42.671
Everybody out!

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.256
Get out! Get out!

01:20:44.381 --> 01:20:45.716
Everybody get out!

01:20:57.603 --> 01:20:59.271
Get out.

01:20:59.396 --> 01:21:00.647
You the fortune-teller?

01:21:00.773 --> 01:21:02.274
Who are you?

01:21:02.399 --> 01:21:03.692
That's an interesting
question.

01:21:04.902 --> 01:21:06.570
Why don't you tell me?

01:21:06.653 --> 01:21:07.696
Willy.

01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.198
Willy?

01:21:09.281 --> 01:21:10.908
Prospect Place Willy?

01:21:10.991 --> 01:21:12.910
Get out of here fast.

01:21:24.797 --> 01:21:26.924
Oda Mae!
Sister! Sister!

01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:31.011
I'm all right.
I'm all right.

01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:35.808
We're in trouble,
so you got to help.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.811
What do you mean we?
You're already dead.

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:41.313
These people
are trying to kill me.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:42.731
And they'll be back.

01:21:42.815 --> 01:21:45.734
Why don't you just find
a house to haunt?

01:21:45.818 --> 01:21:48.278
Get some chains and
rattle them or something.

01:21:48.403 --> 01:21:50.572
I have a plan,
and it will work,

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:52.491
but get some
of your fake I.D.s.

01:21:52.616 --> 01:21:53.826
Forget it.

01:21:53.951 --> 01:21:57.371
If you do this, they'll
never bother you again.

01:22:02.376 --> 01:22:03.460
Scout's honor.

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:06.296
All right.

01:22:06.463 --> 01:22:08.006
What do I have to do?

01:22:08.298 --> 01:22:10.217
What exactly
do I have to do?

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:13.887
You got a nice dress?

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:19.560
I don't see what's wrong
with what I'm wearing.

01:22:19.643 --> 01:22:22.980
Sorry. I made a joke.
I love your shoes.

01:22:23.063 --> 01:22:25.566
I don't know anything
about banking.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:27.985
Oda Mae, would
you just relax?

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:29.611
Listen, I'm nervous.

01:22:29.695 --> 01:22:31.613
I'll get you
through it.

01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:34.032
Your fake driver's
license is great.

01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:37.619
Oh, Sam. I don't think
I should do this.

01:22:37.744 --> 01:22:40.706
Straight ahead.
A stairway that says new accounts.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:42.708
I ain't giving
them money.

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:44.710
Do what I say.
Don't talk.

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.129
Tell her you're here

01:22:47.379 --> 01:22:50.716
to fill out a signature
card for a new account.

01:22:50.799 --> 01:22:55.053
I'm here to fill out
a signature card for a new account.

01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:57.055
Do you know
your account number?

01:22:57.181 --> 01:22:58.724
926-31 043.

01:22:58.849 --> 01:22:59.600
926...

01:22:59.725 --> 01:23:00.601
31 043.

01:23:00.726 --> 01:23:02.436
31 043.

01:23:04.062 --> 01:23:04.980
Rita Miller.

01:23:05.063 --> 01:23:05.981
Who?

01:23:06.064 --> 01:23:06.982
Rita Miller.

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:08.025
Rita Miller.

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:09.610
Didn't you sign a card

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:10.986
when you opened
the account?

01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:13.614
Carl Bruner opened it
for you by phone

01:23:13.739 --> 01:23:15.616
and asked you
to come in today.

01:23:15.741 --> 01:23:18.493
Carl Bruner opened it
for me by phone.

01:23:18.577 --> 01:23:20.704
Now he's asked me
to come in today.

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:23.332
Is that right?

01:23:23.415 --> 01:23:24.917
Yeah.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.839
All right.Just sign this
card on the bottom line, please.

01:23:30.923 --> 01:23:33.842
May I use your pen?
Thank you so much.

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:41.099
No, no, no!
Rita Miller.

01:23:41.183 --> 01:23:43.518
I'm so sorry.

01:23:43.602 --> 01:23:44.937
You know, I...

01:23:45.062 --> 01:23:47.898
I need another one.
I signed the wrong name.

01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:56.114
Make sure it goes up to
the third floor file

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:58.700
because you have
a transaction to make.

01:23:58.784 --> 01:24:01.578
Make sure this goes
to the third floor file.

01:24:01.662 --> 01:24:04.039
I have a transfusion
to make.

01:24:04.122 --> 01:24:04.998
A what?

01:24:05.123 --> 01:24:06.625
Let's go.

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:10.003
You know what I mean.
Can I keep this pen?

01:24:10.128 --> 01:24:12.089
Uh...uh,
yes, sure.

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:13.924
Thank you so much.

01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:17.928
Bye-bye. I just
love these pens.

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:21.515
What do you want to
keep the pen for?

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:22.557
[Ring]

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:23.976
Carl Bruner speaking.

01:24:24.101 --> 01:24:25.560
Hi, Carl.

01:24:25.644 --> 01:24:26.561
Mr. Balistrari.

01:24:26.645 --> 01:24:29.606
Balistrari? Carl,
it's me,John.

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:33.986
John.John, sorry, um,
what--what-- what--what's up?

01:24:34.111 --> 01:24:36.613
I've got the info
on the Bradley portfolio.

01:24:36.655 --> 01:24:37.572
Oh, right.

01:24:37.656 --> 01:24:39.992
I'll pick it up
later, all right?

01:24:40.117 --> 01:24:41.785
I'll be here
till 6:00.

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:50.627
I don't suppose I can
talk you into losing the hat.

01:24:50.711 --> 01:24:52.045
You keep
messing with me,

01:24:52.170 --> 01:24:53.630
you'll be here
by yourself.

01:24:53.755 --> 01:24:59.052
Shh. Now tell the guard
you're here to see Lyle Ferguson.

01:24:59.052 --> 01:25:01.888
Hi. I'm here to see
Lyle Ferguson, please.

01:25:02.014 --> 01:25:03.932
Do you have
an appointment?

01:25:04.016 --> 01:25:05.934
No, I'm here
for my health.

01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:07.936
Tell him Rita
Miller's here.

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.480
You--You just tell him
Rita Miller's here.

01:25:10.605 --> 01:25:11.523
One moment.

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:12.524
Don't embellish.

01:25:12.607 --> 01:25:14.026
Jawohl.

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:15.569
Excuse me?

01:25:19.197 --> 01:25:21.700
Now, listen.
This guy Ferguson's a real jerk.

01:25:21.825 --> 01:25:23.702
I've known him
for five years,

01:25:23.827 --> 01:25:25.704
and he still
thinks my name's--

01:25:25.871 --> 01:25:27.122
Why are you
whispering?

01:25:27.247 --> 01:25:29.416
Just be quiet
and listen.

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:30.876
He's a social moron.

01:25:31.001 --> 01:25:33.712
Just tell the guard
Ferguson knows you.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:36.715
You spent time with him
and his wife Shirley

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:39.718
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year. Got it?

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:41.845
What is this
in regards to?

01:25:41.928 --> 01:25:43.847
What? He doesn't
remember me?

01:25:43.930 --> 01:25:45.849
Oh, we spent
all that time

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:49.186
at the Brewsters' Christmas
party last year.

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:50.812
It was beautiful.

01:25:50.896 --> 01:25:53.857
A big old tree and thousands
of presents everywhere.

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:54.858
It--

01:25:56.777 --> 01:25:58.153
Gas.

01:25:59.237 --> 01:26:02.115
I get a little gas
from time to time.

01:26:02.199 --> 01:26:03.658
That's all. Gas.

01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:06.078
Quit poking me!

01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:07.621
Well,
don't overdo it.

01:26:07.746 --> 01:26:09.664
Now, listen.
This'll be easy.

01:26:09.748 --> 01:26:12.876
Ferguson was so drunk,
he could've had a conversation

01:26:12.959 --> 01:26:15.212
with Tina Turner
and not remember.

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:21.218
I don't know, Sam.

01:26:21.551 --> 01:26:22.844
Here we go.

01:26:26.223 --> 01:26:27.140
Hello. Hello.

01:26:27.224 --> 01:26:28.600
Uh, yes.

01:26:30.185 --> 01:26:31.686
Of course, yes.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:34.272
Well, uh, it's been
a...a long time.

01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:35.273
Long time.

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:37.901
Ask how Bobby
and Snooky are doing.

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:39.903
How are Bobby
and Snooky doing?

01:26:39.945 --> 01:26:42.531
Fine. Fine.
Thank you.

01:26:42.614 --> 01:26:43.949
Thank you
for asking.

01:26:44.074 --> 01:26:48.912
Uh, and how is
your, uh, family?

01:26:48.995 --> 01:26:51.081
Oh, couldn't
be better.

01:26:51.206 --> 01:26:52.749
Well...wonderful.

01:26:52.874 --> 01:26:54.793
Tell him you've
been wondering

01:26:54.876 --> 01:26:57.254
how they did on the
Gibraltar securities.

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:58.797
I was just wondering,

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:01.675
how did you do on
the Gibraltar securities?

01:27:01.800 --> 01:27:03.051
The Gibraltar
securities?

01:27:03.135 --> 01:27:07.013
Well, it looks like we topped out
on that one, huh?

01:27:07.097 --> 01:27:08.014
Sure did.

01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:09.015
Sure did.

01:27:09.099 --> 01:27:10.892
That was
a useful tip.

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:12.102
Good old Randy.

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:15.105
Good old Randy. Got a
good old head on his shoulders.

01:27:15.188 --> 01:27:16.314
Her shoulders.

01:27:16.606 --> 01:27:17.941
Her shoulders.

01:27:18.024 --> 01:27:19.025
Randy.

01:27:19.109 --> 01:27:21.570
So, what, um...

01:27:21.653 --> 01:27:23.113
what brings you
here today?

01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:24.698
You're closing
an account.

01:27:24.823 --> 01:27:26.158
I'm closing an account.

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:28.952
Do you have
your account number?

01:27:29.077 --> 01:27:29.953
Yes?

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:30.996
Yes.

01:27:31.079 --> 01:27:31.997
Yes.

01:27:32.080 --> 01:27:32.998
926-31 043.

01:27:33.081 --> 01:27:35.834
926-31 043.
Is that right?

01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:36.835
Yeah.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.128
Good.

01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:49.806
Well, Rita, it looks like
you'll be withdrawing

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:52.058
$4 million
from us today.

01:27:52.184 --> 01:27:53.643
$4 million!

01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:55.645
Say yes. Say yes!

01:27:55.687 --> 01:27:56.646
Is that correct?

01:27:56.688 --> 01:27:57.647
Yes.

01:27:57.689 --> 01:27:59.983
Yes.
Yes, uh, yes!

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:01.860
Yes, that's correct.

01:28:01.985 --> 01:28:03.570
Easy, easy.

01:28:03.695 --> 01:28:08.825
Yes. Well, how
would you like that?

01:28:08.909 --> 01:28:10.869
1 0s and 20s.

01:28:10.994 --> 01:28:11.912
Pardon?

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:13.622
Tell him
a cashier's check.

01:28:13.747 --> 01:28:16.082
I think better
a cashier's check.

01:28:16.208 --> 01:28:18.001
A cashier's check.
Fine.

01:28:18.084 --> 01:28:20.003
Well, of course,
uh, you know,

01:28:20.086 --> 01:28:22.005
we require identification
from everyone.

01:28:22.088 --> 01:28:23.590
Oh, I see.

01:28:23.715 --> 01:28:25.008
It's just
procedural.

01:28:25.091 --> 01:28:26.801
Yes. I...

01:28:36.686 --> 01:28:37.395
Thank you.

01:28:37.687 --> 01:28:40.148
Well, I'll, uh,
I'll be right back.

01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:43.235
$4 million!

01:28:43.360 --> 01:28:44.236
Shh!

Yeah, get me the
First Island Bank of Nassau.

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:53.745
It's on the Rolodex.

Well, we have some, uh,
things for you to sign here.

01:29:07.717 --> 01:29:10.679

The person you need
is right down on the end.

Mama took the money that
she made in the oil wells,

01:30:00.270 --> 01:30:02.772
and she sunk it
into gas pumps.

01:30:02.814 --> 01:30:04.524
You know, how they have
at the gas station?

01:30:06.276 --> 01:30:07.777
It's very,
very lucrative.

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:08.778

It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

Now, may I keep the pen?

Say good night to Bobby

Bye-bye.

Why are you
rushing me?

What is wrong?

Oh.

Excuse me. Lyle?

01:30:40.352 --> 01:30:41.853
Oh, yes. Uh...

just doing business with...

Yeah?

01:30:47.942 --> 01:30:49.277
What did she want?

01:30:49.402 --> 01:30:51.863
Did it have anything
to do with Sam?

01:30:51.988 --> 01:30:54.199
Sam? Why, no. No.

01:30:54.282 --> 01:30:56.618
That was Oda Mae Brown,
right?

01:30:56.868 --> 01:30:58.620
No. Her name
was Rita Miller.

01:30:58.912 --> 01:31:00.413
She was closing
an account.

01:31:00.538 --> 01:31:01.915
Is there a problem?

01:31:03.249 --> 01:31:06.753
No, I guess not.

One of my accounts
is closed.

Which account?
What's wrong?

01:31:45.959 --> 01:31:48.253
You want me
to call someone?

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:49.879
No, it's OK.

01:31:49.963 --> 01:31:51.923

do with this money?

to buy the block.

Take the check
out of your purse.

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:17.115
Right. I should put it
where nobody can get it.

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:18.533
No. No. Endorse it.

01:32:18.616 --> 01:32:21.536
If I endorse it,
then if I drop it,

01:32:21.619 --> 01:32:23.121
somebody will get it.

I never said you were
going to get the money.

01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:29.127
It's blood money.
I was killed for this money.

01:32:29.252 --> 01:32:30.587
Now,
endorse the check.

to go to heaven.

you're making me do this.

01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:24.682
Now give it to her.

01:33:24.766 --> 01:33:27.268

one more time.

01:58:02.534 --> 01:58:03.493
Molly?

01:58:06.121 --> 01:58:07.622
I can hear you.

01:58:44.617 --> 01:58:45.785
Oh, God.

01:59:33.792 --> 01:59:35.543
Sam?

01:59:35.627 --> 01:59:37.587
They're waiting
for you, Sam.

01:59:49.015 --> 01:59:50.517
I'll miss you.

01:59:52.185 --> 01:59:54.229
Your mother
would be proud.

01:59:54.562 --> 01:59:57.857
I'm going to miss
you, too, Sam.

01:59:57.941 --> 01:59:59.275
You're all right.

02:00:01.236 --> 02:00:02.654
Bye, Oda Mae.

02:00:04.572 --> 02:00:05.281
Bye, Sam.

02:00:28.638 --> 02:00:29.931
I love you, Molly.

02:00:32.642 --> 02:00:34.686
I've always
loved you.

02:00:41.443 --> 02:00:42.318
Ditto.

02:01:03.840 --> 02:01:05.175
It's amazing, Molly.

02:01:06.843 --> 02:01:08.261
The love inside...

02:01:08.386 --> 02:01:10.346
you take it
with you.

02:01:22.400 --> 02:01:23.318
See ya.

02:01:31.326 --> 02:01:32.243
See ya.

02:01:51.721 --> 02:01:52.931
Bye.
