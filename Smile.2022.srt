00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:05,919
Dr. Cotter

2
00:02:06,156 --> 00:02:08,239
He will die. She will
die, my mother will die

3
00:02:08,287 --> 00:02:10,010
.I will die. Everyone will die

4
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,162
I couldn't get him to talk.

5
00:02:15,494 --> 00:02:17,199
He doesn't say anything.

6
00:02:18,748 --> 00:02:21,312
- This. - Yes

7
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:22,663
.Understood

8
00:02:23,055 --> 00:02:24,068
Thank you, Dan.

9
00:02:24,242 --> 00:02:28,170
She will die. My mother is going to
die. I am going to die. Everyone will die

10
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:31,563
It doesn't matter to
anyone. It doesn't matter

11
00:02:31,663 --> 00:02:33,796
It doesn't matter. Mom doesn't matter

12
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:36,287
I don't matter. Everyone doesn't matter

13
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:40,967
He will die. She will die. I
will die. Everyone will die

14
00:02:41,097 --> 00:02:43,308
It doesn't matter to anyone. It
doesn't matter, she doesn't matter

15
00:02:43,332 --> 00:02:45,401
I'm going to die. Everyone's going to die.

16
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:47,471
It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter.

17
00:02:47,597 --> 00:02:48,485
Mom doesn't matter

18
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:50,444
It doesn't matter to anyone. I don't matter

19
00:02:50,588 --> 00:02:52,656
..me me

20
00:02:52,848 --> 00:02:53,918
..me me

21
00:02:53,982 --> 00:02:55,235
..hey..hey

22
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:57,115
everyone..me

23
00:02:57,217 --> 00:02:59,000
It doesn't matter if it's me

24
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,044
Hello, Karl

25
00:03:08,185 --> 00:03:09,803
How are you today?

26
00:03:12,008 --> 00:03:13,473
I will die, you know?

27
00:03:13,705 --> 00:03:14,902
.no

28
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:17,115
.I do not think so

29
00:03:20,453 --> 00:03:22,484
I think you're having another panic attack.

30
00:03:22,523 --> 00:03:23,539
..no

31
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,418
Don't argue!

32
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:27,124
You don't know

33
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:31,881
I feel like everyone around me is squeezing

34
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,783
.I am afraid

35
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:41,463
Carl, I know what you're
up against looks like...

36
00:03:41,923 --> 00:03:43,082
.real

37
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:46,040
.but it can't hurt you.

38
00:03:50,743 --> 00:03:51,994
.I promise you

39
00:03:52,742 --> 00:03:55,310
He will die, she will
die, my mother will die

40
00:03:55,406 --> 00:03:57,294
I'm going to die, everyone will die.

41
00:03:57,516 --> 00:03:58,673
It doesn't matter what.

42
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,231
Hello, Wanda

43
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:02,935
I'll put Karl Rinken under
observation for a few days.

44
00:04:03,006 --> 00:04:03,795
It's harmless

45
00:04:03,828 --> 00:04:06,051
Just make sure he checks
it in. One every few hours

46
00:04:06,097 --> 00:04:07,747
- That's it. - Thank you

47
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:10,087
Dr. Desai is looking for you

48
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:12,232
.Thanks

49
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,534
!No no! don't

50
00:04:24,664 --> 00:04:25,673
You don't understand!

51
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:29,253
I don't want to go inside!

52
00:04:29,488 --> 00:04:32,168
!no! no

53
00:04:53,689 --> 00:04:54,701
.Please come in

54
00:04:56,313 --> 00:04:57,007
.Welcome

55
00:04:57,158 --> 00:04:59,553
Did you transfer a patient her name?

56
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:02,611
Sarah Marquette to the hall yesterday?

57
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:03,510
.Yes

58
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:05,647
She has a history of drug abuse and mania

59
00:05:05,702 --> 00:05:08,047
She's in and out of our unit a few times.

60
00:05:08,294 --> 00:05:09,787
.(Rose), she doesn't have insurance.

61
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,619
Well, but she needs treatment.

62
00:05:11,674 --> 00:05:15,388
The board of directors pressures me not to make
a bed for anyone in need in the residency program

63
00:05:15,412 --> 00:05:19,345
Perhaps the board of directors should try
to care about the purpose of our work here.

64
00:05:22,312 --> 00:05:23,916
Listen, I don't doubt your judgment, okay?

65
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,780
I need you to come to me first so I
can see what to do next time, okay?

66
00:05:26,873 --> 00:05:27,884
.Yes

67
00:05:28,271 --> 00:05:29,605
Well, I'm sorry

68
00:05:30,018 --> 00:05:32,824
You haven't been here since
your last shift last night, right?

69
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:09,772
Dr. Cotter

70
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:12,072
Laura Weaver, age 26, a graduate student

71
00:06:12,143 --> 00:06:13,857
The police were called on her.
Because of breach of the public.

72
00:06:13,881 --> 00:06:16,187
- EMS moved her here.
- Does she have a history of mental illness?

73
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:17,214
I didn't report anything.

74
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:20,646
But the police reported a different incident
in which they were involved in the past weeks.

75
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:22,114
What was that accident?

76
00:06:22,321 --> 00:06:25,607
A teacher at her school beat
himself to death with a hammer

77
00:06:25,931 --> 00:06:27,787
She was interrogated as the only witness

78
00:06:28,049 --> 00:06:29,155
hammer?

79
00:06:39,583 --> 00:06:40,729
.Welcome

80
00:06:41,384 --> 00:06:42,395
(Lura)?)

81
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:47,728
My name is Dr. Cotter

82
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:50,471
I am a psychiatrist.
Would you like to sit down?

83
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:55,283
.Good

84
00:06:57,182 --> 00:06:58,603
I know you're nervous.

85
00:06:59,488 --> 00:07:00,499
.There is nothing wrong

86
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,099
I just want to have a conversation

87
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,802
I promise you this place is safe.

88
00:07:06,997 --> 00:07:08,424
.not for me

89
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,078
Why do you say that?

90
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:19,322
Come on, let's sit down

91
00:07:28,085 --> 00:07:29,097
.Help yourself

92
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:48,206
Well, I have to ask..you
have a few questions

93
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:49,898
Some of them might look stupid

94
00:07:53,205 --> 00:07:55,409
What day of the week is this?

95
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,196
.Thursday

96
00:07:58,256 --> 00:07:59,448
And a month?

97
00:07:59,551 --> 00:08:01,039
October. I'm not crazy

98
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:02,625
No one says that

99
00:08:02,673 --> 00:08:06,266
But I want you to understand that
I'm a doctoral student and I'm not crazy

100
00:08:06,402 --> 00:08:07,830
- All right? - I just

101
00:08:08,116 --> 00:08:11,925
Take a breath and I want
you to tell me what's going on

102
00:08:22,076 --> 00:08:23,798
I see something.

103
00:08:25,593 --> 00:08:27,893
.something that no one else can see but me.

104
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,315
I know how crazy this sounds.

105
00:08:32,442 --> 00:08:33,927
..I know but this

106
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:36,313
This thing I can't explain.

107
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:39,379
What do you see?

108
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,950
He is embodied as a person.

109
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,240
He's not a person.

110
00:08:45,963 --> 00:08:47,054
I'm not sure I understand

111
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,653
He looks like different people.
He looks like different people

112
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:52,442
Sometimes he pretends to be someone I know

113
00:08:52,506 --> 00:08:53,663
And sometimes it seems like a stranger

114
00:08:53,678 --> 00:08:54,692
..Sometimes

115
00:08:55,055 --> 00:08:57,881
And sometimes he looks like my grandfather

116
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,156
Who died in front of me
when I was 7 years old

117
00:09:02,925 --> 00:09:04,849
But it's always the same.

118
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:08,298
..it's a

119
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,732
..it looks like

120
00:09:11,628 --> 00:09:15,024
Looks like he's wearing
people's faces like masks

121
00:09:16,485 --> 00:09:17,485
.Good

122
00:09:18,003 --> 00:09:19,795
Well, do you see him here now?

123
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:26,077
What happens when you see it?

124
00:09:30,011 --> 00:09:31,512
.smiles at me

125
00:09:33,027 --> 00:09:36,281
But it's not a friendly smile,
the worst smile I've ever seen

126
00:09:36,423 --> 00:09:38,554
..and when i see her

127
00:09:38,974 --> 00:09:43,155
I have a terrible feeling that something
really terrible is going to happen

128
00:09:44,395 --> 00:09:47,008
I've never been scared
at all when I see him

129
00:09:48,953 --> 00:09:53,980
Laura, have you or anyone in
your family ever had hallucinations?

130
00:09:54,069 --> 00:09:56,528
It's not a hallucination. It's
real. you don't understand

131
00:09:56,587 --> 00:10:00,285
He does things to me and
causes terrible things around me

132
00:10:00,781 --> 00:10:03,761
It's taking over my whole life, my mind and

133
00:10:05,562 --> 00:10:07,222
.tell me things

134
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:11,301
tell me that today

135
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,073
today is the day you will

136
00:10:15,609 --> 00:10:17,589
.do not worry. There is nothing wrong

137
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:24,658
I know what you're
suffering from seems very real

138
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,880
Sometimes when we get
overwhelmed with feelings,

139
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:30,482
Or we suffer a severe shock

140
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:31,517
..that our minds

141
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:34,565
You're not listening to me! Oh my God!

142
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:39,247
I will die and no one will listen to me

143
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:41,124
Well, Laura, it's okay

144
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:43,527
.My God

145
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:45,156
Listen, it's okay

146
00:10:45,157 --> 00:10:48,171
(Laura, would you look at me, please?)

147
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:50,728
.There is nothing wrong

148
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
.look at me

149
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,602
!My God! no

150
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,324
!he is here

151
00:11:03,395 --> 00:11:05,031
- Go away. - It's okay, Laura

152
00:11:05,089 --> 00:11:05,855
- It's just me! - No

153
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:08,203
- No one but me here! - No

154
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:11,205
!no

155
00:11:18,312 --> 00:11:19,496
!My God

156
00:11:21,746 --> 00:11:23,937
I have a patient in an emergency
situation. In Room No. 2

157
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:26,796
I need the crew to come here now. quickly

158
00:11:48,042 --> 00:11:49,234
(Lura)?)

159
00:13:30,164 --> 00:13:35,072
|| smile ||

160
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,844
Was Miss Weaver ever sick here?

161
00:14:08,089 --> 00:14:08,876
.no

162
00:14:08,974 --> 00:14:12,006
Was it typical of the
patients you see here?

163
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:15,259
It is an emergency psychiatric unit

164
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:18,301
Nothing is typical here

165
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,664
Well, she's a psychopath, right?

166
00:14:20,988 --> 00:14:23,060
Excuse me, a psychopath?

167
00:14:26,827 --> 00:14:30,190
We're just trying to get your
assessment of her mental state

168
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:34,219
..she was suffering

169
00:14:35,406 --> 00:14:37,784
From acute post-traumatic psychosis

170
00:14:41,051 --> 00:14:42,931
She was suffering from
delusions of persecution

171
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:44,433
What kind of illusions?

172
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,493
..was convinced that

173
00:14:47,935 --> 00:14:50,604
That there is a spirit of a
demonic entity chasing her.

174
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:52,621
.nice

175
00:14:55,015 --> 00:14:58,965
We'll contact Miss Weaver's family
to try to explain what happened.

176
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:03,544
So, we're looking for anything
that might make sense to all of this.

177
00:15:03,601 --> 00:15:07,447
If there's anything else you
can tell us that might be helpful?

178
00:15:16,477 --> 00:15:17,911
..Before

179
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,810
..you are death

180
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,177
..she was

181
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,351
.smiling

182
00:15:27,228 --> 00:15:29,980
Yes, it looks crazy to me.

183
00:18:10,421 --> 00:18:11,421
.(Day)

184
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:14,004
it's up to you

185
00:18:16,031 --> 00:18:17,860
it is my fault. Did I hide you?

186
00:18:18,381 --> 00:18:20,180
I didn't hear you come in. the curse

187
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:23,011
- Hello. - Hello

188
00:18:25,073 --> 00:18:26,264
What is the matter?

189
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:28,668
.no thing. sorry

190
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,189
There is something wrong

191
00:18:34,859 --> 00:18:36,492
She died sick today

192
00:18:36,644 --> 00:18:37,844
.she was my patient

193
00:18:39,734 --> 00:18:41,630
come close

194
00:18:42,251 --> 00:18:43,574
.I'm sorry for hearing this

195
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,852
It happened in front of me.

196
00:18:47,563 --> 00:18:48,836
It was terrible

197
00:18:50,308 --> 00:18:52,527
I'm so sorry, is there
any help I can offer?

198
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,428
It's not a good start.

199
00:19:02,189 --> 00:19:06,008
Maybe we cancel dinner tonight?

200
00:19:09,239 --> 00:19:10,841
.It's not possible

201
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,723
Holly hired a babysitter

202
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:17,584
And you might get a big
headache if we don't go.

203
00:19:17,828 --> 00:19:20,054
No way, Holly gets a headache?

204
00:19:22,474 --> 00:19:23,485
Hey

205
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,856
Do you know how fatigue is?

206
00:19:37,095 --> 00:19:39,183
Now when Jackson is in first grade

207
00:19:39,245 --> 00:19:41,949
I get up at 6 o'clock every day

208
00:19:42,013 --> 00:19:44,136
I make breakfast and prepare lunch box

209
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:47,537
And only God knows which foods
are served in the school cafeteria

210
00:19:47,752 --> 00:19:49,236
Then take him to school

211
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:51,259
I hardly had time to get my stuff done

212
00:19:51,386 --> 00:19:52,954
And I didn't even have time to do Pilates.

213
00:19:52,978 --> 00:19:54,723
- My body is in bad shape.
- That's not right

214
00:19:54,747 --> 00:19:56,756
Then I go back to school to pick it up

215
00:19:56,827 --> 00:19:59,602
I take him to workouts, soccer and swimming

216
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:00,876
.. and Karate and theatre

217
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:02,456
Now he's starting to speak Spanish

218
00:20:03,507 --> 00:20:05,454
Either days of the week
are really impossible

219
00:20:08,744 --> 00:20:10,000
Are you coming on Saturday?

220
00:20:11,173 --> 00:20:12,173
What?

221
00:20:13,138 --> 00:20:14,839
Sorry, how about Saturday?

222
00:20:15,486 --> 00:20:16,704
Are you kidding?

223
00:20:17,388 --> 00:20:19,381
It's Jackson's 7th birthday party

224
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:21,214
I told you this 5 times.

225
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:23,056
.I can not come. I have work

226
00:20:23,909 --> 00:20:25,317
what do you mean? It's Saturday?

227
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:26,969
I work on Saturday

228
00:20:27,239 --> 00:20:28,730
I think it's exactly for this reason

229
00:20:28,763 --> 00:20:31,277
You should leave that disgusting
hospital and work in a private clinic

230
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:34,032
- It's not disgusting.
- You should have a normal working day

231
00:20:34,162 --> 00:20:37,710
Rose, there are surely a lot
of madmen who are actually

232
00:20:37,828 --> 00:20:39,068
They will pay you for your time

233
00:20:39,171 --> 00:20:41,351
Thank you very much for your opinion, Greg

234
00:20:41,422 --> 00:20:42,422
.This kindness of you

235
00:20:42,523 --> 00:20:46,038
Just saying why become
a doctor. If you can't be rich

236
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:47,992
you're kidding, right?

237
00:20:48,821 --> 00:20:51,427
Rose loves being a doctor.
She serves for nothing.

238
00:20:54,637 --> 00:20:56,598
While talking about
wasted earning potential

239
00:20:56,622 --> 00:20:58,121
.Maybe we can sell the house

240
00:20:58,334 --> 00:20:59,773
Can we not talk about this now, please?

241
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:01,542
I don't understand. abandoned house

242
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,249
We were brought up in that house.

243
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:06,608
It's about to fall. Why don't we
take advantage of the earth's money?

244
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,438
Can you shut up?

245
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:10,696
Wow

246
00:21:12,290 --> 00:21:13,361
.Thanks

247
00:21:13,504 --> 00:21:14,730
.Thank you so much

248
00:21:17,007 --> 00:21:18,418
I was looking forward to this meal

249
00:21:35,803 --> 00:21:38,479
"Activate the night system"

250
00:21:51,931 --> 00:21:52,989
are you OK?

251
00:21:53,447 --> 00:21:54,468
.Yes

252
00:22:12,545 --> 00:22:13,727
Good morning, Doctor.

253
00:22:16,996 --> 00:22:17,996
.good morning

254
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:28,007
.Welcome

255
00:22:28,032 --> 00:22:30,353
Yesterday, sick (Laura Weaver)

256
00:22:30,401 --> 00:22:32,478
The police sent a report...
about a different incident

257
00:22:32,502 --> 00:22:34,075
.that she was involved in

258
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,879
Can you send this to me?

259
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,063
It's up to you, Doctor.

260
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,844
Also, I was supposed to
have a session with Jane Park

261
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:43,380
Yes, she pulled a lock of her
hair last night and swallowed it.

262
00:22:43,754 --> 00:22:46,045
They took her to the emergency
room for gastric lavage

263
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:47,333
.the curse

264
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,938
.(Day)

265
00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:55,593
..What do you do

266
00:22:55,635 --> 00:22:58,669
I was just around the corner
on a errand and I thought maybe

267
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,239
You know, we didn't talk much last night

268
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:06,978
.about it all

269
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:08,601
I just want you to know.

270
00:23:08,688 --> 00:23:11,435
When we received the report, I didn't know

271
00:23:11,508 --> 00:23:13,690
It was up to you. So,
I'm sorry. it was weird

272
00:23:13,857 --> 00:23:15,860
It's your job, I understand.

273
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,284
How are you?

274
00:23:18,624 --> 00:23:20,096
(Jules, why are you here?)

275
00:23:21,947 --> 00:23:25,278
You know, like I said I was... on a
mission around the corner and just thought

276
00:23:27,211 --> 00:23:29,240
Coming to check on you

277
00:23:30,157 --> 00:23:33,235
You know, everything that
happened yesterday wasn't easy.

278
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,836
Well, I appreciate it, but I
don't want you to check on me.

279
00:23:41,716 --> 00:23:42,716
.Good

280
00:23:43,295 --> 00:23:46,074
No, yeah, I mean... sorry.

281
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,910
I have to go back to work

282
00:23:49,611 --> 00:23:50,305
.Yes

283
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,393
.I'll see you later

284
00:23:59,003 --> 00:24:00,868
You know she's engaged, right?

285
00:24:02,932 --> 00:24:03,932
.yes

286
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,668
.I'm single

287
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:20,348
Weaver says Muñoz approached her.

288
00:24:20,427 --> 00:24:22,712
"Holding a Hammer"

289
00:24:25,078 --> 00:24:28,999
"He hit himself"

290
00:24:31,857 --> 00:24:34,811
"smile at her"

291
00:24:36,694 --> 00:24:38,262
Holly is calling

292
00:24:44,225 --> 00:24:46,078
- Hello. - Hello

293
00:24:46,692 --> 00:24:48,559
Listen, I just wanted to
apologize for last night, okay?

294
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,299
I shouldn't have pressed you like that

295
00:24:51,894 --> 00:24:53,017
..no Me

296
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:55,564
.who should i apologize

297
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,750
I've been going through
some tough things lately

298
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,812
My company wasn't good

299
00:25:01,626 --> 00:25:03,871
Well, if you can't, come to Jackson's party

300
00:25:03,966 --> 00:25:06,291
At least you can bring him a gift.

301
00:25:06,608 --> 00:25:09,594
If you want ideas about it, he
likes the miniature railway game.

302
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,655
You look weird, are you okay?

303
00:25:13,746 --> 00:25:15,369
Yes, no, I'm fine.

304
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:31,910
Patient Room 817

305
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:42,851
Hello, Karl.

306
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:46,091
How do you feel today?

307
00:25:57,396 --> 00:25:58,396
.(Karl)

308
00:26:03,857 --> 00:26:04,915
(Carl?)

309
00:26:11,206 --> 00:26:12,370
.she will die

310
00:26:12,491 --> 00:26:14,528
.I will die. Everyone will die

311
00:26:14,581 --> 00:26:15,802
Carl, look at me.

312
00:26:15,952 --> 00:26:17,389
You are going to die

313
00:26:17,587 --> 00:26:19,106
.you will die

314

.you will die

.you will die

319
00:26:27,998 --> 00:26:29,604
- You're going to die! - Help

320
00:26:29,747 --> 00:26:32,088
Calm patient 5150!

321
00:26:32,161 --> 00:26:33,534
Tied his limbs!

322
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:36,974
!no! no

.was aggressive

329
00:27:02,715 --> 00:27:05,200
I think it's a psychotic episode

330
00:27:05,416 --> 00:27:07,771
Karl Rinken was in and
out of here several times

331
00:27:07,812 --> 00:27:10,920
He has never shown
any aggressive behaviour.

332
00:27:10,968 --> 00:27:12,603
Do you mean I'm making this up?

333
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:15,736
Of course not, but yesterday was
one of your..patients you are caring for

334
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:18,286
She brutally killed herself in front of you

335
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:23,252
Is it possible that when I assumed
that Rinken... was a danger to himself

336
00:27:23,325 --> 00:27:25,578
And your brain reacted to this?

337
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,788
I might assume I underestimated
the situation and overreacted

338
00:27:35,706 --> 00:27:36,706
.Good

339
00:27:36,742 --> 00:27:39,404
So, here's what happens

340
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,704
You will take a week off with pay

341
00:27:42,712 --> 00:27:44,155
Morgan, it's not necessary.

342
00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:47,242
You worked 80 hours a week for a month

343
00:27:47,645 --> 00:27:49,748
I'm afraid you haven't had enough sleep.

344
00:27:50,513 --> 00:27:53,757
We can't help these patients
unless our mental health is healthy

345
00:27:54,688 --> 00:27:58,374
It is in the interest of loneliness for
you. Take a week off to clear your mind

346
00:27:58,894 --> 00:28:01,261
Do whatever you have to do
to get your focus back, okay?

347
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:05,192
Children's model train shop

348
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,199
"Are you coming home soon?"

349
00:30:16,223 --> 00:30:19,183
Trever: Sorry, I'm still stuck at work.
I hope you had a better day today.

350
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:15,527
.the curse

351
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:27,474
Welcome?

352
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:29,475
This security company "First Line".

353
00:32:29,555 --> 00:32:31,482
May I have your name and passcode?

354
00:32:31,865 --> 00:32:33,720
I'm Rose Cotter

355
00:32:34,024 --> 00:32:35,044
"Acapulco"

356
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,148
The door alarm has been triggered.

357
00:32:37,343 --> 00:32:41,026
Yes, the back door to my house is open.

358
00:32:41,258 --> 00:32:42,771
Are you alone at home, ma'am?

359
00:32:43,472 --> 00:32:44,472
.Yes

360
00:32:44,811 --> 00:32:46,164
Are you sure?

361
00:32:47,926 --> 00:32:48,531
What?

362
00:32:48,629 --> 00:32:51,683
Are you sure you didn't
let anyone in, Rose?

363
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,058
Look behind you

364
00:33:35,681 --> 00:33:36,681
Welcome?

365
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:38,372
This security company "First Line".

366
00:33:38,526 --> 00:33:40,379
May I have your name and password?

367
00:34:01,615 --> 00:34:04,228
We searched the house inside
and out. We didn't find anything

368
00:34:05,096 --> 00:34:07,093
How about the back door?

369
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:09,909
Was it possibly left open the
last time you tried to close it?

370
00:34:12,236 --> 00:34:13,501
.I do not know, maybe

371
00:34:14,092 --> 00:34:17,345
Listen, you don't have to worry about
it. False alarms happen all the time

372
00:34:18,250 --> 00:34:20,281
If something comes up, call us.

373
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,726
.Good

374
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:24,755
Good evening, sir

375
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,150
.Good evening

376
00:34:31,387 --> 00:34:32,387
what happened?

377
00:34:36,155 --> 00:34:37,265
Mustache?

378
00:34:39,097 --> 00:34:40,287
".mustache"

379
00:34:41,335 --> 00:34:43,993
So, is there a reason for
you to sound the alarm?

380
00:34:46,443 --> 00:34:48,031
I don't really remember doing that

381
00:34:48,070 --> 00:34:51,173
I must have fired it
unintentionally or something

382
00:34:52,869 --> 00:34:54,033
unintentionally?

383
00:34:55,757 --> 00:34:57,365
.sorry

384
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:59,254
My head was like this

385
00:34:59,382 --> 00:35:02,649
Confused, turbulent and
distracted..mind all day long and

386
00:35:03,038 --> 00:35:04,672
Then a strange incident occurred at work

387
00:35:04,718 --> 00:35:08,097
..and then my boss asked me to take

388
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:13,683
.sorry

389
00:35:14,313 --> 00:35:15,576
.everything is fine

390
00:35:16,121 --> 00:35:17,121
Are you sure?

391
00:35:17,319 --> 00:35:19,893
Yes, I'm fine. I was
expressing my feelings.

392
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:23,069
.Good

393
00:35:28,498 --> 00:35:29,961
Can you search for herty "Mustache"?

394
00:35:30,001 --> 00:35:31,744
I couldn't find it anywhere.

395
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:32,806
.yes

396
00:35:39,657 --> 00:35:41,438
(Rose, did you break another glass?)

397
00:35:46,638 --> 00:35:47,725
Mustache?

398
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,584
.Come

399
00:36:01,196 --> 00:36:02,403
"mustache"

400
00:36:59,653 --> 00:37:02,115
He looks like different people

401
00:37:02,245 --> 00:37:04,934
Sometimes he pretends to be someone else.

402
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,205
And sometimes it looks weird, and sometimes

403
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:10,237
And sometimes he looks like my grandfather

404
00:37:10,324 --> 00:37:12,603
Who died in front of me
when I was 7 years old

405
00:37:13,046 --> 00:37:14,574
But it's all the same

406
00:37:15,884 --> 00:37:17,359
.smiles at me

407
00:37:17,415 --> 00:37:20,671
It's not a friendly smile, the
worst smile I've ever seen

408
00:37:20,876 --> 00:37:22,735
And when I see her

409
00:37:22,751 --> 00:37:26,571
I have a terrible feeling that
something terrible is going to happen

410
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:29,664
!My God. no

411
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:30,825
!no

412
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:32,316
No, he's here!

413
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:33,429
.I beg you

414
00:37:33,635 --> 00:37:36,494
!step away! no

415
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,242
I have a patient in an emergency
situation. In Room No. 2

416
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:42,912
I need the crew to come
here right now. quickly

417
00:37:44,885 --> 00:37:45,885
(Lura)?)

418
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:48,314
.(Day)

419
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:58,027
(Lura)?)

420
00:37:59,173 --> 00:38:00,253
.(Day)

421
00:38:09,613 --> 00:38:10,613
(Lura)?)

422
00:38:11,335 --> 00:38:13,219
.(Day)

423
00:38:21,605 --> 00:38:22,644
(Lura)?)

424
00:38:31,513 --> 00:38:32,513
!(Day)

425
00:38:44,295 --> 00:38:45,302
(Day)?)

426
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:47,351
!(Day)! (Day)

427
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:48,720
What the hell is this, Rose?

428
00:38:49,086 --> 00:38:50,752
Rose, put the knife down!

429
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:56,072
!(Day)

430
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:15,762
.Welcome

431
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:18,472
(Day)?)

432
00:39:20,259 --> 00:39:21,259
This is a surprise

433
00:39:24,557 --> 00:39:27,003
It's not about her blood.

434
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:28,334
..it's about

435
00:39:29,685 --> 00:39:30,934
. in her face

436
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:33,602
The look she was giving her

437
00:39:34,673 --> 00:39:36,123
How did it make you feel?

438
00:39:39,476 --> 00:39:40,844
Feeling clearly awful

439
00:39:45,375 --> 00:39:46,556
.Weakness

440
00:39:47,352 --> 00:39:48,657
.guilt

441
00:39:49,131 --> 00:39:50,131
Guilt?

442
00:39:51,074 --> 00:39:52,469
She was my patient

443
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:54,426
She was a troubled young woman

444
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,336
The one you only met for 10 minutes.

445
00:39:57,691 --> 00:39:59,083
Yes, I'm just

446
00:40:00,890 --> 00:40:02,942
I feel like it's stuck in my mind

447
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,607
I can't get it out of my head.

448
00:40:04,892 --> 00:40:07,964
Have you ever thought about
why it's stuck in your mind?

449
00:40:08,631 --> 00:40:11,218
Could it actually relate
to your mother's suicide?

450
00:40:15,951 --> 00:40:17,532
Do you still blame yourself?

451
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:20,985
..listen

452
00:40:21,557 --> 00:40:26,021
I really don't want to try to
discuss..this part of my life right now, so

453
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:29,581
What do you want to talk?

454
00:40:30,984 --> 00:40:34,131
..I was hoping to

455
00:40:34,297 --> 00:40:36,767
Get Risperdal's recipe

456
00:40:43,076 --> 00:40:44,519
since that happened

457
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,130
..with the patient, me

458
00:40:50,244 --> 00:40:51,429
I see things

459
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,486
And I hear things

460
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:58,990
I'm sure it's post-traumatic
stress disorder

461
00:40:59,062 --> 00:41:01,304
Let's move away from self-diagnosis

462
00:41:03,073 --> 00:41:05,266
What did you see and hear?

463
00:41:09,095 --> 00:41:11,464
Memories of what happened with my patient

464
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:13,542
..she looks

465
00:41:13,988 --> 00:41:16,573
Hallucinations about moments of tension

466
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:22,389
But when that happens, it seems

467
00:41:23,465 --> 00:41:25,174
tangible and

468
00:41:25,437 --> 00:41:27,110
.worrying

469
00:41:29,144 --> 00:41:32,781
Rose, I guess it doesn't look
like I have delusions or ailments.

470
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:35,511
And definitely not delusional

471
00:41:35,908 --> 00:41:38,525
My impression is that what
you encountered with your patient

472
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:42,505
Raised old anxiety with a
lot of stress and lack of sleep

473
00:41:42,866 --> 00:41:46,297
You have wounds that have not fully healed

474
00:41:48,572 --> 00:41:50,547
And maybe these wounds never heal

475
00:41:50,588 --> 00:41:51,708
This is the nature of shock

476
00:41:52,227 --> 00:41:54,384
But you can learn how to control it

477
00:41:56,724 --> 00:42:00,970
Did you keep seeing patients
while you were dealing with all this?

478
00:42:01,638 --> 00:42:02,638
.no

479
00:42:02,814 --> 00:42:04,256
.I'm on vacation

480
00:42:04,758 --> 00:42:05,758
.Good

481
00:42:07,009 --> 00:42:10,109
If you want my advice, use this
time to get busy with different things

482
00:42:10,452 --> 00:42:11,726
I do anything.

483
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:14,560
It distracts your mind from the
things that cause this tension

484
00:42:15,148 --> 00:42:18,408
..I also think it will be useful

485
00:42:19,706 --> 00:42:22,293
If we resume our regular sessions again

486
00:42:27,439 --> 00:42:28,439
.naturally

487
00:42:33,555 --> 00:42:35,496
What about Risperdal?

488
00:42:35,661 --> 00:42:36,671
..i

489
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:39,821
Let's talk again next week,
before thinking about medication

490
00:42:42,574 --> 00:42:44,495
Meanwhile, you can always call me.

491
00:42:48,645 --> 00:42:49,645
.naturally

492
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:23,812
I ordered a white wine drink.

493
00:43:23,877 --> 00:43:24,888
.My God

494
00:43:26,592 --> 00:43:28,274
- God, you were able to come. - Hello

495
00:43:28,345 --> 00:43:29,356
!Surprise

496
00:43:29,458 --> 00:43:30,918

Come on, open it!

516
00:45:10,722 --> 00:45:11,890
What did you get dear?

..no

518

- No! - Oh, my God!

519
00:45:29,254 --> 00:45:31,063
“No, no.” Mustache

520
00:45:35,476 --> 00:45:36,812
what is wrong with you?

521
00:45:36,898 --> 00:45:38,241
It's not real.

522
00:45:38,682 --> 00:45:40,074
"mustache"

523
00:45:43,716 --> 00:45:44,985
.No no

.It was not me. I swear

526
00:45:50,616 --> 00:45:53,365
Please believe me.

527
00:45:53,991 --> 00:45:56,447
No one believes me

528
00:46:05,558 --> 00:46:07,501
Who the hell are you?!

529
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:09,366
Leave me alone!

530
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,332
Do you see it?

531
00:46:11,903 --> 00:46:13,542
You must see it

532
00:46:13,582 --> 00:46:15,872
Holly, say you see someone.

533
00:46:16,083 --> 00:46:17,096

535

Hello, Rose

536
00:46:51,282 --> 00:46:52,295
.the curse

537
00:46:53,707 --> 00:46:57,356
I heard you entered the emergency
room, I came to check on you, how are you?

538
00:46:58,418 --> 00:46:59,418
.Fine

539
00:46:59,879 --> 00:47:02,026
It was just an accident. Thanks

540
00:47:02,713 --> 00:47:05,676
They said you had a panic attack

541
00:47:08,128 --> 00:47:10,310
Rose, I'll be honest with
you. I'm worried about you

542
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,575
I mean this as a friend but I
really think you should see a doctor

543
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:15,999
Are you seeing a psychiatrist now?

544
00:47:22,662 --> 00:47:23,875
Are you listening, Rose?

545
00:47:25,399 --> 00:47:29,639
"no pain"

546
00:47:49,192 --> 00:47:50,192
.wait

547
00:47:50,996 --> 00:47:52,494
I want you to tell you something.

548
00:47:53,138 --> 00:47:54,661
..I want you to know

549
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:58,271
I'm not crazy, okay?

550
00:47:59,503 --> 00:48:00,503
.Good

551
00:48:00,757 --> 00:48:01,757
.Good

552
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,278
..there is something

553
00:48:07,714 --> 00:48:09,123
.happens to me

554
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:15,718
And it'd be hard for you to really believe.

555
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:20,578
.Maybe we should go in

556
00:48:20,809 --> 00:48:22,511
No, listen to me

557
00:48:22,549 --> 00:48:23,824
.sorry

558
00:48:25,219 --> 00:48:26,302
Really sorry

559
00:48:27,012 --> 00:48:28,332
..Good

560
00:48:30,454 --> 00:48:31,956
There is something threatening me

561
00:48:32,997 --> 00:48:34,603
..it's like

562
00:48:35,217 --> 00:48:37,897
.evil spirit or force

563
00:48:38,860 --> 00:48:41,229
I really don't know what it is

564
00:48:41,663 --> 00:48:42,663
..but

565
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:46,052
But I think he killed my patient.

566
00:48:46,572 --> 00:48:50,961
She described that she was suffering
from the same thing before her death

567
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:52,777
..and now somehow

568
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:55,000
He tied himself to me

569
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:57,640
..And

570
00:48:59,004 --> 00:49:02,384
.afraid that something bad will happen

571
00:49:09,244 --> 00:49:10,757
I really want you to say something.

572
00:49:12,675 --> 00:49:13,894
What do you want me to say?

573
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,071
I want you to believe me

574
00:49:20,372 --> 00:49:22,176
Now you're talking about a ghost.

575
00:49:22,607 --> 00:49:25,422
No, it's not a ghost.

576
00:49:27,113 --> 00:49:28,218
It's something else.

577
00:49:28,727 --> 00:49:29,727
.Good

578
00:49:33,837 --> 00:49:34,837
.Sorry

579
00:49:36,294 --> 00:49:37,294
.I can not

580
00:49:38,345 --> 00:49:40,083
I can't do this now

581
00:49:40,286 --> 00:49:41,886
No. (Trever

582
00:49:41,936 --> 00:49:44,167
Hey, Trevor. Do Not Enter

583
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:47,838
I want you.. that you
don't listen to what I say

584
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:49,262
- All right? - Well, (Rose .)

585
00:49:49,633 --> 00:49:53,641
What am I supposed to reply now?

586
00:49:54,326 --> 00:49:56,801
Do you listen to yourself?
You're talking crazy things.

587
00:49:56,899 --> 00:49:58,513
I'm not crazy

588
00:49:58,641 --> 00:50:00,481
.sorry

589
00:50:01,476 --> 00:50:02,900
But it's hereditary, right?

590
00:50:04,332 --> 00:50:05,332
What?

591
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:08,171
.mental occupation

592
00:50:09,208 --> 00:50:10,702
It can be inherited from both parents

593
00:50:11,604 --> 00:50:14,004
- You inquired about that.
- Why did you inquire about that?

594
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,140
..because I

595
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:20,880
I wanted to know what I might have been
associated with for the rest of my life

596
00:50:22,375 --> 00:50:24,017
Is this unfair?

597
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:28,034
I'm going into the house

598
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,412
No, Trever, my life is in danger

Did you kill Mustache? - No

601
00:50:34,899 --> 00:50:37,709
No, it wasn't me.

602
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:41,295
So, tell me what happened.

603
00:50:43,453 --> 00:50:45,521
There was something

604
00:50:47,098 --> 00:50:48,376
Trever, please.

605
00:50:49,001 --> 00:50:50,779
.I beg you

606
00:50:52,164 --> 00:50:53,164
.I beg you

00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,311
Mrs. Muñoz?

624
00:53:43,623 --> 00:53:47,029
I first noticed it .some changes

625
00:53:50,111 --> 00:53:51,875
Then it all happened so quickly

626
00:53:54,368 --> 00:53:55,906
He was nervous

627
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,837
.panicked

628
00:53:59,834 --> 00:54:02,489
He would wake up in the
middle of the night and scream

629
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,262
I've never heard him
scream like that before.

630
00:54:10,014 --> 00:54:12,677
Then he stopped sleeping completely.

631
00:54:15,904 --> 00:54:19,311
I noticed him talking to himself

632
00:54:19,446 --> 00:54:20,772
He was seeing things

633
00:54:21,872 --> 00:54:24,998
He does weird things that
he doesn't seem to remember

634
00:54:26,043 --> 00:54:27,686
Then one morning he disappeared

635
00:54:29,626 --> 00:54:31,425
That night, the police called

636
00:54:32,195 --> 00:54:33,671
And they told me he died

637
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,194
They asked me to identify his body

638
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:42,330
.face

639
00:54:45,468 --> 00:54:49,094
Twenty-five years of marriage.
This is what I remember of him

640
00:54:53,687 --> 00:54:54,881
.I am very sorry

641
00:55:06,307 --> 00:55:10,811
Did Gabriel ever describe
the things he was seeing?

642
00:55:16,076 --> 00:55:17,185
.I will show you

643
00:55:29,085 --> 00:55:30,760
..I have to remove all of these

644
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,942
But I can't stand being here.

645
00:55:52,748 --> 00:55:54,937
This is what Gabriel said he sees

646
00:56:04,442 --> 00:56:08,067
He was always saying
this. He's trying to get into it

647
00:56:10,941 --> 00:56:13,111
That's Gabriel's brother

648
00:56:13,604 --> 00:56:16,825
He died in an accident 20 years ago.

649
00:56:17,752 --> 00:56:19,563
Gabriel never recovered from this.

650
00:56:20,568 --> 00:56:22,072
Since when did this happen?

651
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:25,319
Since returning from that conference,
which he participates in every year

652
00:56:27,610 --> 00:56:30,754
Because he saw a terrible
woman commit suicide

653
00:56:32,527 --> 00:56:33,953
But no one reported it.

654
00:56:36,955 --> 00:56:39,368
Did he see someone commit suicide?

655
00:56:41,269 --> 00:56:42,269
.yes

656
00:56:43,101 --> 00:56:45,200
- I thought you knew that.
- What was her name?

657
00:56:47,218 --> 00:56:48,935
I don't remember, I have to find it

658
00:56:54,586 --> 00:56:56,664
have you ever

659
00:56:59,381 --> 00:57:01,177
To mention why all this happened?

660
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:04,384
Did he find an explanation for all this?

661
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,081
Which correspondence are you?

662
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:12,101
Mrs. Muñoz, your husband wasn't crazy

663
00:57:12,941 --> 00:57:15,300
The things he was seeing were real.

664
00:57:15,435 --> 00:57:16,577
I see it

665
00:57:16,874 --> 00:57:18,356
What, are you a psychopath?

666
00:57:18,954 --> 00:57:19,391
What?

667
00:57:19,414 --> 00:57:20,735
Obsessed with?

668
00:57:20,781 --> 00:57:22,604
How dare you?

669
00:57:22,804 --> 00:57:26,476
No, please. What happened
to your husband happens to me

670
00:57:26,572 --> 00:57:28,579
Get out of the house! I want
you out of my house now!

671
00:57:28,603 --> 00:57:31,407
Mrs. Muñoz, just give me the name, please

672
00:57:31,495 --> 00:57:33,812
Get out of my house!

673
00:58:10,489 --> 00:58:11,489
.the curse

674
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:25,440
yes?

675
00:58:32,097 --> 00:58:33,140
.Welcome

676
00:58:40,019 --> 00:58:41,059
.come in

677
00:58:55,158 --> 00:58:58,648
You finally got rid of that yellow couch

678
00:59:01,889 --> 00:59:03,630
So how are you?

679
00:59:05,256 --> 00:59:08,066
Surely you didn't come
here..to share news based on

680
00:59:08,139 --> 00:59:09,815
Rough show a few days ago

681
00:59:12,034 --> 00:59:13,077
I want a favor

682
00:59:14,248 --> 00:59:16,406
I want you to not ask questions about this.

683
00:59:16,974 --> 00:59:19,189
.Fabulous. Yes. tell me what it is

684
00:59:19,579 --> 00:59:21,256
Nine days ago

685
00:59:21,311 --> 00:59:24,610
A man named (Gabriel
Muñoz) committed suicide

686
00:59:25,336 --> 00:59:27,157
..I want to know if

687
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:30,469
Involved in other recent police reports

688
00:59:30,711 --> 00:59:32,987
Can you find out from here for me?

689
00:59:33,902 --> 00:59:35,030
Really, are you serious?

690
00:59:37,057 --> 00:59:39,662
It's my only day off.
Go to the police station

691
00:59:39,748 --> 00:59:40,946
Jules, please.

692
00:59:48,041 --> 00:59:49,041
.Good

693
00:59:49,526 --> 00:59:50,636
Yeah, damn it

694
00:59:55,894 --> 00:59:57,036
What is his name again?

695
00:59:58,076 --> 00:59:59,599
(Gabriel Muñoz)

696
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,057
Well, this is a report of his death.

697
01:00:10,965 --> 01:00:13,579
Yes, another report..a week ago

698
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,653
From the state police station

699
01:00:15,701 --> 01:00:16,743
What was it about?

700
01:00:17,407 --> 01:00:18,728
It was a witness statement

701
01:00:18,762 --> 01:00:21,262
He was staying in a hotel in
which a woman committed suicide

702
01:00:21,477 --> 01:00:24,040
Well, what was that woman's name?

703
01:00:29,936 --> 01:00:31,279
(Angela Powell)

704
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:33,454
She was a real estate agent

705
01:00:33,493 --> 01:00:34,561
What is this?

706
01:00:36,739 --> 01:00:37,427
.the curse

707
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:38,708
What is the matter?

708
01:00:39,944 --> 01:00:41,409
It's a picture from the scene.

709
01:00:41,459 --> 01:00:42,468
Let me see it

710
01:00:42,785 --> 01:00:43,385
.no

711
01:00:43,748 --> 01:00:44,757
- Let me see her. - No

712
01:00:44,812 --> 01:00:47,122
You can't see this.
It's part of the evidence.

713
01:00:47,162 --> 01:00:49,426
Or no, you can see it.

714
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,000
.fuck

715
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:57,123
I warned you, it's disgusting.

716
01:00:59,742 --> 01:01:00,742
.Good

717
01:01:02,649 --> 01:01:03,334
.Good

718
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,058
I want you to do the same search again

719
01:01:05,089 --> 01:01:07,044
But this time about that woman, Angela

720
01:01:07,149 --> 01:01:09,259
Could you tell me what all this is, please?

721
01:01:09,451 --> 01:01:11,685
Jules, you promised not
to ask me any questions

722
01:01:11,926 --> 01:01:14,413
No, it was you who asked
me to ask you any questions

723
01:01:14,565 --> 01:01:16,047
Jules, I need your help.

724
01:01:17,312 --> 01:01:18,312
Good?

725
01:01:21,828 --> 01:01:22,828
.I beg you

726
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,942
There was a previous report
submitted. Four days before death.

727
01:01:47,957 --> 01:01:49,239
It's a strange coincidence

728
01:01:49,269 --> 01:01:51,396
She was also questioned
about a .suicide case

729
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,478
What is this? Is this a video file?

730
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,538
It's a CCTV video.

731
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:10,398
His job

732
01:02:10,438 --> 01:02:12,533
He just endures.

733
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:24,369
What the hell?

734
01:02:56,959 --> 01:02:59,022
My day was going well

735
01:02:59,093 --> 01:03:01,116
Would you turn it back on? Really?

736
01:03:01,207 --> 01:03:02,680
Play it back, Jules

737
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:09,351
What is this?

738
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:17,193
Is he smiling?

739
01:03:26,859 --> 01:03:28,446
Rose, who are these people?

740
01:03:37,025 --> 01:03:38,083
.I have to go

741
01:03:39,298 --> 01:03:40,374
Where are you going?

742
01:03:42,722 --> 01:03:44,133
(Rose, where are you going?)

743
01:03:44,513 --> 01:03:47,002
what is going on? I'm confused now

744
01:03:47,078 --> 01:03:48,362
Do me another favor.

745
01:03:49,445 --> 01:03:50,512
Do you have a printer?

746
01:04:29,449 --> 01:04:30,449
(Trever?)

747
01:04:30,626 --> 01:04:31,739
Are you here, Trevor?

748
01:04:32,938 --> 01:04:33,985
.Welcome

749
01:04:34,143 --> 01:04:35,391
Hello, Rose

750
01:04:37,877 --> 01:04:38,877
What is this?

751
01:04:39,132 --> 01:04:41,700
What are you doing here? I
just wanted to make sure of you

752
01:04:41,763 --> 01:04:43,492
I was talking to my fiancé

753
01:04:45,686 --> 01:04:46,686
.I called her

754
01:04:48,968 --> 01:04:49,968
Why?

755
01:04:51,574 --> 01:04:52,574
..because of you

756
01:04:53,358 --> 01:04:56,290
You were really acting crazy.

757
01:04:56,337 --> 01:04:57,190
..no

758
01:04:57,215 --> 01:04:58,865
I didn't know what to do

759
01:04:58,977 --> 01:05:00,066
are you kidding me?

760
01:05:02,155 --> 01:05:05,646
I turn to you because you are supposed
to be the most trusted person in the world

761
01:05:05,701 --> 01:05:09,500
And I admitted that I was very scared.

762
01:05:10,171 --> 01:05:12,439
And I needed you

763
01:05:14,704 --> 01:05:16,675
Except you didn't listen to me

764
01:05:16,705 --> 01:05:18,699
No, why do you think I called her?

765
01:05:19,353 --> 01:05:21,187
All I'm trying to do is help you

766
01:05:21,279 --> 01:05:24,477
No, all you're trying to do is
put the responsibility on others.

767
01:05:25,199 --> 01:05:28,171
You have no problem as long as
everything is easy and acceptable

768
01:05:28,196 --> 01:05:32,333
But, God forbid, if it was
anything serious or difficult

769
01:05:32,724 --> 01:05:34,160
..and only you

770
01:05:34,335 --> 01:05:38,491
You will think about how this will
destroy your whole ideal life plan

771
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:40,389
Hey, are you really serious now?

772
01:05:40,657 --> 01:05:41,282
.Yes

773
01:05:41,384 --> 01:05:43,705
If that's how you feel,
why are we even together?

774
01:05:44,946 --> 01:05:45,946
.Maybe I do not know

775
01:05:46,036 --> 01:05:47,528
..why not everyone take a breath and

776
01:05:47,586 --> 01:05:50,178
Don't act like home is your home!

777
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:53,548
(Rose, are you really leaving now?)

778
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,306
- (Greg. - (Rose), what are you doing here?

779
01:06:07,345 --> 01:06:08,701
Is Holly here? .I want to talk to her

780
01:06:08,725 --> 01:06:10,061
I don't think it's a good idea

781
01:06:10,113 --> 01:06:12,341
Greg, I want to talk to
my sister! (Okay? (Holly .)

782
01:06:12,409 --> 01:06:14,026
You come here and talk to me like that?

783
01:06:14,043 --> 01:06:15,849
Holly, can I talk to you for a moment?

784
01:06:15,945 --> 01:06:17,399
- I don't think she should be here.
- Can I talk to you?

785
01:06:17,423 --> 01:06:19,170
Honestly, it's not a good idea.

786
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:21,103
- It's okay. (- (Holly .)

787
01:06:21,158 --> 01:06:23,127
- Go inside. - All right

788
01:06:25,117 --> 01:06:26,117
.My God

789
01:06:27,661 --> 01:06:28,988
.Well Well

790
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:32,688
how are you?

791
01:06:33,844 --> 01:06:37,253
I realize it all now

792
01:06:38,434 --> 01:06:41,157
I was cursed

793
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:42,835
.My God

794
01:06:43,007 --> 01:06:45,254
Or somehow it ended up with me in a curse

795
01:06:45,272 --> 01:06:46,911
I got it from my patient

796
01:06:47,031 --> 01:06:47,917
It was announced

797
01:06:47,964 --> 01:06:51,033
And when she died, she
passed the curse on me

798
01:06:51,111 --> 01:06:54,404
and now that I'm facing a threat from

799
01:06:55,607 --> 01:06:56,607
.entity

800
01:06:57,202 --> 01:06:58,502
an entity?

801
01:06:58,572 --> 01:07:00,191
He's the one who killed Mustache

802
01:07:00,297 --> 01:07:03,208
And he was at the Christmas party
yesterday but you couldn't see him

803
01:07:03,844 --> 01:07:05,861
No one can see it but me

804
01:07:06,936 --> 01:07:07,936
.My God

805
01:07:07,990 --> 01:07:09,052
No, Holly

806
01:07:09,122 --> 01:07:11,162
I know it's hard to believe.

807
01:07:11,337 --> 01:07:13,977
And I know it was hard for
me. I believe him from the start

808
01:07:14,057 --> 01:07:15,482
Look at this

809
01:07:16,393 --> 01:07:17,075
.My God

810
01:07:17,124 --> 01:07:19,278
Why do you have these pictures?

811
01:07:19,341 --> 01:07:21,126
Because this happened to other people.

812
01:07:21,168 --> 01:07:22,506
- And then they all died. (- (Rose .)

813
01:07:22,530 --> 01:07:23,907
Holly, I'll be next.

814
01:07:23,948 --> 01:07:25,582
Curses aren't real.

815
01:07:26,565 --> 01:07:28,275
..that you kind of suffer from

816
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:31,281
.nervous breakdown

817
01:07:32,054 --> 01:07:32,669
What?

818
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:34,726
No, Holly.

819
01:07:35,587 --> 01:07:36,797
You don't listen to me

820
01:07:36,982 --> 01:07:38,967
- You don't listen to me. - (Rose

821
01:07:39,558 --> 01:07:41,792
This is exactly what
happened to our mother.

822
01:07:47,831 --> 01:07:49,074
This looks like it

823
01:07:55,032 --> 01:07:56,489
How did you know this?

824
01:07:57,417 --> 01:07:58,317
Sorry .. what?

825
01:07:58,390 --> 01:08:00,302
You weren't there when my mom got sick

826
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,073
Where were you really when she died?

827
01:08:02,146 --> 01:08:03,891
I don't know what you're talking about

828
01:08:04,984 --> 01:08:07,944
Because I was the older sister, I
suffered worse than my mother's madness.

829
01:08:08,385 --> 01:08:12,108
I had to leave home because it's
the only way to go on with my life

830
01:08:13,775 --> 01:08:16,000
and sorry

831
01:08:17,454 --> 01:08:21,320
Because I left you alone

832
01:08:21,394 --> 01:08:22,882
That's your confusion

833
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:27,804
I know it wasn't fair. I wish I
could do something about it.

834
01:08:27,865 --> 01:08:30,001
Because I tried so hard..to
move on with my life

835
01:08:30,097 --> 01:08:32,210
And leave all this nonsense behind, okay?

836
01:08:32,315 --> 01:08:33,581
..And you

837
01:08:33,693 --> 01:08:36,977
You can't accept the fact that my mom
lost her mind and committed suicide.

838
01:08:37,056 --> 01:08:40,474
And you let this take over your whole life. And
you blame me because I don't want that either.

839
01:08:40,498 --> 01:08:43,027
Sorry I'm actually..I'm
trying to help people

840
01:08:43,187 --> 01:08:46,906
Instead of being a grumbling
housewife stuck at home

841
01:08:46,955 --> 01:08:50,656
She lives in her arrogant, selfish bubble

842
01:08:55,775 --> 01:08:57,767
- Well. - I don't know why I said that

843
01:08:59,861 --> 01:09:01,981
I won't go into this.

844
01:09:02,523 --> 01:09:03,593
I'm not going to get into this with you.

845
01:09:03,617 --> 01:09:05,839
You totally shocked Jackson, okay?

846
01:09:07,539 --> 01:09:09,699
I can't fight anything with
you while you're like this

847
01:09:21,346 --> 01:09:22,346
.the curse

848
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:24,960
.the curse

849
01:09:55,066 --> 01:09:56,066
(Holly?)

850
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:06,567
.the curse

851
01:10:13,333 --> 01:10:14,674
.the curse

852
01:10:16,532 --> 01:10:17,735
.the curse

853
01:11:25,354 --> 01:11:26,047
(Joule)?)

854
01:11:26,127 --> 01:11:29,247
Why didn't you tell me there was a
connection between your illness and others?

855
01:11:30,204 --> 01:11:31,902
.After you left, I inquired about it.

856
01:11:32,486 --> 01:11:35,711
These cases have a pattern.
One is getting more and more

857
01:11:35,759 --> 01:11:38,681
So far, 20 cases have been
found, including 19 suicide cases

858
01:11:38,786 --> 01:11:40,341
It is a direct chain.

859
01:11:40,588 --> 01:11:44,509
And the things these people
do to themselves, Rose, are ugly

860
01:11:44,755 --> 01:11:48,373
Hey, you said 20 cases, but
only 19 of them are suicide

861
01:11:48,741 --> 01:11:50,550
One of the cases did not follow the pattern

862
01:11:50,652 --> 01:11:52,135
He's an accountant, Robert Talley

863
01:11:52,248 --> 01:11:54,640
His co-worker committed
suicide in front of him

864
01:11:54,749 --> 01:11:56,543
And after four days of
that..(I present (Tali .)

865
01:11:56,567 --> 01:11:59,402
Suddenly killing a woman
he had never met in his life

866
01:11:59,544 --> 01:12:01,801
And here it is, a week later

867
01:12:01,927 --> 01:12:05,220
An eyewitness who witnessed a crime.
The murder committed suicide as well.

868
01:12:05,827 --> 01:12:07,067
The pattern is repeating itself

869
01:12:07,243 --> 01:12:09,060
Is he alive? - Yes

870
01:12:09,132 --> 01:12:10,774
He is in Altoona prison

871
01:12:11,587 --> 01:12:13,029
Jules, I have to talk to him.

872
01:12:40,740 --> 01:12:43,657
- I want you to say something.
- Yes, I'll do that

873
01:12:43,737 --> 01:12:45,674
..just... just

874
01:12:47,621 --> 01:12:49,124
Give me a moment.. I mean, oh my God

875
01:12:49,244 --> 01:12:51,492
I thought you'd say it's just

876
01:12:51,589 --> 01:12:53,980
Suicide cult and blackmail conspiracy

877
01:12:54,234 --> 01:12:55,740
..I mean that this

878
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:56,977
Hey, Jules

879
01:12:59,277 --> 01:13:00,277
.Good

880
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:02,840
Just let's rule out the possibility

881
01:13:02,888 --> 01:13:06,116
The presence of an evil
spirit or supernatural forces

882
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:10,050
What you are saying is that
there is..something is moving

883
01:13:10,676 --> 01:13:14,140
From one person to another...
and make them kill themselves

884
01:13:14,449 --> 01:13:16,441
Well, maybe it's not suicides.

885
01:13:16,635 --> 01:13:17,656
What do you mean?

886
01:13:18,070 --> 01:13:20,499
My patient, Laura, was terrified

887
01:13:20,516 --> 01:13:22,116
But she didn't intend to commit suicide.

888
01:13:22,506 --> 01:13:25,325
And then at the end,
everything about her changed

889
01:13:25,497 --> 01:13:26,881
as if it's

890
01:13:27,753 --> 01:13:31,272
The person I was talking to has disappeared

891
01:13:32,562 --> 01:13:34,437
..and there is one more thing

892
01:13:35,338 --> 01:13:36,360
.have it

893
01:13:39,543 --> 01:13:42,384
He's like that guy

894
01:13:42,423 --> 01:13:43,155
.Yes

895
01:13:43,252 --> 01:13:45,907
- On the surveillance camera that...
- Yeah, exactly like that

896
01:13:46,654 --> 01:13:48,791
Oh my God, what the hell is this?

897
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,005
..in the cases I found

898
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:02,839
How long was the time
between each victim and another?

899
01:14:07,394 --> 01:14:09,279
No one survived for more than a week

900
01:14:12,727 --> 01:14:16,149
Some of them did not even exceed four days

901
01:14:22,726 --> 01:14:24,026
Today is my fourth day

902
01:14:28,478 --> 01:14:31,329
Whatever happened to these
people, it won't happen to you

903
01:14:34,714 --> 01:14:35,714
.I promise you

904
01:14:38,737 --> 01:14:42,545
"Translation by Dr. Ali Talal"

905
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:56,311
"correctional prison"

906
01:14:57,013 --> 01:14:59,787
Let the guard go to Gate 3

907
01:15:01,077 --> 01:15:02,106
.Thanks

908
01:15:02,142 --> 01:15:04,052
Open the door, they have a pass.

909
01:15:05,766 --> 01:15:06,807
"No talking in the hallway"

910
01:15:06,831 --> 01:15:08,101
I'll owe you this, Doug

911
01:15:08,690 --> 01:15:12,139
You two are fortunate that he refuses
to even meet his assigned lawyer.

912
01:15:13,105 --> 01:15:14,695
You know what this guy did, right?

913
01:15:14,928 --> 01:15:18,367
Dr. Kotter specializes in
psychological profiling in cases like this

914
01:15:19,459 --> 01:15:21,598
Well, Tally is totally insane.

915
01:15:21,692 --> 01:15:22,847
So, good luck

916
01:15:23,290 --> 01:15:25,351
I'll give you 10 minutes with him, okay?

917
01:15:25,399 --> 01:15:27,279
Longer than this period.
Requires a court order

918
01:15:28,395 --> 01:15:29,395
.I appreciate that

919
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,935
No contact during the visit.

920
01:16:04,339 --> 01:16:06,942
Sir. Tully. My name is Rose Cotter

921
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:08,661
..me, you know

922
01:16:09,222 --> 01:16:12,350
I hope you know the
answer to a few questions

923
01:16:12,678 --> 01:16:14,962
.لا تسأليني أيّ أسئلة .لقد اعترفت

924
01:16:15,294 --> 01:16:18,357
في الواقع لست مهتمة .بما اتهمت به

925
01:16:18,872 --> 01:16:20,590
..ما أريد معرفته هو

926
01:16:20,654 --> 01:16:23,824
ما الذي واجهته في الأيام
.التي سبقت ارتكابك الجريمة

927
01:16:29,277 --> 01:16:30,955
..كان لديّ مريضة

928
01:16:32,072 --> 01:16:33,251
.امرأة شابة

929
01:16:35,238 --> 01:16:37,382
..قبل أربعة أيام ثمة رجل

930
01:16:37,809 --> 01:16:39,194
.أنتحر أمامها

931
01:16:40,004 --> 01:16:42,077
..منذ ذلك الحين، إنها بدأت

932
01:16:42,569 --> 01:16:45,360
.ترى شيء ما

933
01:16:47,688 --> 01:16:49,762
شيء يتجسد بهيئة .أشخاص آخرين

934
01:16:50,891 --> 01:16:53,696
..والرجل الذي رأته ينتحر

935
01:16:54,155 --> 01:16:57,978
.كان يدعي أنه يرى ذات الشيء

936
01:16:58,113 --> 01:17:00,377
ما الذي تريدينه مني بحق الجحيم؟

937
01:17:00,651 --> 01:17:02,441
ـ ما هو؟ .ـ لا اعرف

938
01:17:04,306 --> 01:17:05,308
.لا أعرف

939
01:17:05,378 --> 01:17:08,628
لمَ الجميع الذين رأوا الشيء
ماتوا وأنت لا زلت حيًا؟

940
01:17:09,234 --> 01:17:10,397
.لماذا؟ أرجوك

941
01:17:10,874 --> 01:17:13,127
سيّد (تالي)، يمكنك مساعدتها، حسنًا؟

942
01:17:13,624 --> 01:17:14,624
.أرجوك

943
01:17:19,409 --> 01:17:20,796
.اطلبي من الشرطي المغادرة

944
01:17:22,450 --> 01:17:23,877
.هذا لن يحدث

945
01:17:24,122 --> 01:17:27,280
اطلبي منه المغادرة .وسأخبركِ بما اعرفه

946
01:17:31,033 --> 01:17:32,134
.(جول)، ارجوك)

947
01:17:38,213 --> 01:17:39,256
.سأنتظر في الخارج

948
01:17:52,702 --> 01:17:56,046
حاولت جاهدًا البحث عن
كل .شيء يتعلق بذلك الشيء

949
01:17:56,443 --> 01:17:58,427
كانت هناك سلسلة آخرى .في الماضي

950
01:17:58,578 --> 01:18:00,824
"وجدت واحدة في" البرازيل .قبل بضعة أعوام

951
01:18:04,134 --> 01:18:06,712
ثمة رجل هناك تخطى ..تلك السلسلة

952
01:18:10,023 --> 01:18:12,999
من خلال قتل جاره وانتقل
.ذلك الشيء إلى زوجة جاره

953
01:18:14,198 --> 01:18:17,337
..ستموت مريضتكِ

954
01:18:17,387 --> 01:18:19,687
.ما لم تقتل شخصًا

955
01:18:20,027 --> 01:18:22,307
إنها الطريقة الوحيدة .للتخلص من ذلك

956
01:18:23,078 --> 01:18:24,350
.the only way

957
01:18:24,976 --> 01:18:27,566
You have to make sure that
there is a witness to move him

958
01:18:27,622 --> 01:18:29,419
Because this thing spreads through shock.

959
01:18:29,928 --> 01:18:32,948
This is what gives him strength. By shock

960
01:18:33,386 --> 01:18:35,926
And your patient must make it work

961
01:18:36,422 --> 01:18:38,139
Tell her to use a weapon

962
01:18:38,752 --> 01:18:40,687
and make it the biggest mess

963
01:18:40,761 --> 01:18:42,248
I can't kill anyone.

964
01:18:44,954 --> 01:18:45,954
You?

965
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:49,312
Do you have this?

966
01:18:50,758 --> 01:18:52,179
.no no no

967
01:18:52,220 --> 01:18:54,224
Why did you come here?

968
01:18:54,249 --> 01:18:56,001
I won't let this come back to me.

969
01:18:56,065 --> 01:18:57,559
- Go away! - Sorry!

970
01:18:58,317 --> 01:18:59,498
Get out of here!

971
01:18:59,643 --> 01:19:01,219
Get her away from me!

972
01:19:01,563 --> 01:19:03,403
Get her away from me!

973
01:19:03,903 --> 01:19:05,651
Get her away from me!

974
01:19:05,802 --> 01:19:07,614
Get her away from me!

975
01:19:15,115 --> 01:19:16,115
Hey

976
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:18,300
Hey

977
01:19:18,329 --> 01:19:19,329
.Wait

978
01:19:21,174 --> 01:19:22,518
What happened? - Nothing

979
01:19:23,813 --> 01:19:24,813
What did he say?

980
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:27,729
.no thing

981
01:19:28,692 --> 01:19:29,692
no thing?

982
01:19:30,652 --> 01:19:32,347
He's totally crazy

983
01:20:21,980 --> 01:20:23,932
Dr. Madeleine Northcott is calling.

984
01:21:11,891 --> 01:21:13,196
Trevor: Where are you?

985
01:21:13,429 --> 01:21:15,272
We should talk. Are you home?

986
01:21:17,911 --> 01:21:18,911
.the curse

987
01:22:14,751 --> 01:22:15,600
What are you doing here?

988
01:22:15,672 --> 01:22:18,883
I'm sorry if we surprised
you yesterday. It was wrong.

989
01:22:18,901 --> 01:22:19,664
.sorry

990
01:22:19,688 --> 01:22:21,616
.Yes, you should go.

991
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:22,840
()Day)

992
01:22:23,019 --> 01:22:25,842
We both know that I have a
responsibility..to report to the authorities

993
01:22:25,866 --> 01:22:27,900
If you pose a danger to yourself or others

994
01:22:28,108 --> 01:22:30,834
And I want you to convince
me that you're not a danger.

995
01:22:44,208 --> 01:22:46,376
He reminded Trevor of a ghost

996
01:22:48,004 --> 01:22:49,412
I didn't use the word 'ghost'

997
01:22:51,606 --> 01:22:54,154
.evil soul. Paranormal

998
01:22:56,801 --> 01:22:59,439
I confessed to him that I see things

999
01:22:59,496 --> 01:23:00,942
The same things I told you

1000
01:23:01,108 --> 01:23:02,649
But I don't see her anymore, okay?

1001
01:23:02,674 --> 01:23:05,246
It was stress and lack of sleep.

1002
01:23:06,519 --> 01:23:09,043
I wished him so. Seems like a mistake

1003
01:23:09,764 --> 01:23:12,103
But that's it, okay?

1004
01:23:12,567 --> 01:23:13,644
Are we in agreement?

1005
01:23:14,773 --> 01:23:16,283
How do you feel today?

1006
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,897
..let me think

1007
01:23:22,839 --> 01:23:25,232
I'm pretty sure my fiancé thinks me crazy

1008
01:23:26,998 --> 01:23:31,856
And my sister kept me
out of her life completely

1009
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:33,579
..and now

1010
01:23:34,495 --> 01:23:39,078
My previous treatment is
conducting an unannounced home visit

1011
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,935
To make sure I'm not a danger.

1012
01:23:42,031 --> 01:23:43,031
..so

1013
01:23:43,717 --> 01:23:45,438
Otherwise, I'm really fine.

1014
01:23:55,590 --> 01:23:56,900
Won't you answer the phone?

1015
01:24:02,926 --> 01:24:03,496
What?

1016
01:24:03,648 --> 01:24:05,946
(Rose), it's Madeleine.

1017
01:24:06,527 --> 01:24:08,500
I've been trying to reach you all morning

1018
01:24:09,391 --> 01:24:11,898
I'm so worried about
what happened yesterday.

1019
01:24:14,779 --> 01:24:15,800
(Rose)? - No

1020
01:24:16,821 --> 01:24:17,860
Do you still hear me?

1021
01:24:22,964 --> 01:24:23,964
Welcome?

1022
01:24:25,319 --> 01:24:26,642
- No. - (Rose)?

1023
01:24:27,857 --> 01:24:29,117
.No no

1024
01:24:29,796 --> 01:24:31,853
Time is running out for you, Rose

1025
01:24:33,506 --> 01:24:35,116
Who the hell are you?

1026
01:24:39,227 --> 01:24:40,227
.no

1027
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:44,760
.No no

1028
01:24:46,368 --> 01:24:47,780
.no no no

1029
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:54,520
.no

1030
01:26:05,021 --> 01:26:06,075
Hello, Dr. Cotter

1031
01:26:07,088 --> 01:26:08,608
Aren't you supposed to be on vacation?

1032
01:26:09,624 --> 01:26:11,683
I came to get something from my office

1033
01:26:51,322 --> 01:26:53,165
(Karl). Welcome)

1034
01:26:57,489 --> 01:26:59,118
- No, no. - It's okay

1035
01:26:59,379 --> 01:27:00,726
.no no no

1036
01:27:00,758 --> 01:27:02,214
- It's okay. - Oh my God

1037
01:27:02,490 --> 01:27:03,504
.no no no

1038
01:27:06,036 --> 01:27:08,275
- Calm down. - No, no

1039
01:27:08,953 --> 01:27:09,982
!silent

1040
01:27:11,362 --> 01:27:12,723
calm down, okay?

1041
01:27:13,007 --> 01:27:14,007
.(Day)

1042
01:27:15,225 --> 01:27:16,410
What are you doing here?

1043
01:27:19,829 --> 01:27:20,829
.I do not know

1044
01:27:23,061 --> 01:27:25,288
Rose, you can't get close to the sick.

1045
01:27:58,155 --> 01:27:59,313
Damn it, Rose!

1046
01:28:19,496 --> 01:28:22,052
!the curse

1047
01:28:37,257 --> 01:28:38,626
(Rose, what are you doing here?)

1048
01:28:40,596 --> 01:28:41,596
.no thing

1049
01:28:43,124 --> 01:28:44,651
..I don't know

1050
01:28:44,751 --> 01:28:47,146
..I don't know why me

1051
01:28:47,749 --> 01:28:49,978
Why don't we go in together and talk?

1052
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,040
!no

1053
01:28:51,783 --> 01:28:52,623
It's not safe

1054
01:28:52,647 --> 01:28:55,032
Rose, I don't think you should.
You should be alone now.

1055
01:28:55,062 --> 01:28:56,650
I want you to be alone

1056
01:28:59,088 --> 01:29:00,689
I have to be alone.

1057
01:29:03,342 --> 01:29:05,463
Sorry, I have to go.

1058
01:29:08,070 --> 01:29:10,306
Listen, Rose, I don't think
you should go anywhere, okay?

1059
01:29:10,330 --> 01:29:12,448
Just calm down. I'll make a call

1060
01:29:14,771 --> 01:29:16,294
Rose, don't go anywhere!

1061
01:29:16,802 --> 01:29:19,023
Rose, please, don't go anywhere. Wait

1062
01:29:19,715 --> 01:29:21,941
Rose, wait! (Rose)

1063
01:29:43,584 --> 01:29:44,651
Jules is calling

1064
01:29:48,307 --> 01:29:48,751
.(joules)

1065
01:29:48,919 --> 01:29:51,663
There is a circular to all police
patrols about being a danger.

1066
01:29:51,704 --> 01:29:52,975
What the hell happened?

1067
01:29:53,040 --> 01:29:54,073
I know what I'm doing

1068
01:29:54,458 --> 01:29:57,291
This thing he wants from all his victims

1069
01:29:57,433 --> 01:29:58,733
To pass it on to someone else

1070
01:29:58,764 --> 01:30:01,654
But if no one sees it, you
won't pass on to anyone

1071
01:30:02,308 --> 01:30:05,140
As long as I'm on my own,
I'll prevent this from happening

1072
01:30:05,268 --> 01:30:06,615
.it does not make sense

1073
01:30:06,662 --> 01:30:08,838
Do you intend to avoid people forever?

1074
01:30:08,992 --> 01:30:11,556
I'm not going to run away yet, okay?

1075
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:13,911
I have to face him

1076
01:30:14,013 --> 01:30:16,767
Well, Rose, I'm coming
to you..just tell me.

1077
01:31:24,575 --> 01:31:26,222
Jules is calling

.please help me

1081

Your mother made a mistake

1082
01:34:14,951 --> 01:34:16,468
.that phone

1083
01:34:17,720 --> 01:34:19,350
.Call for help

It's okay dear

1087
01:38:54,024 --> 01:38:55,024
come close

1088
01:39:06,885 --> 01:39:10,186
.I'm so sorry

1089
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:14,915
I wasn't a good mother

1090
01:39:17,855 --> 01:39:18,952
I wanted to be too

1091
01:39:18,977 --> 01:39:22,738
I really tried to be.

1092
01:39:23,103 --> 01:39:24,606
..but sometimes

1093
01:39:24,667 --> 01:39:29,220
.everything is burdened

1094
01:39:30,695 --> 01:39:33,779
There is something horrible inside of me.

1095
01:39:35,204 --> 01:39:36,626
- I hate myself. - Stop it

1096
01:39:36,689 --> 01:39:38,425
stop. stop

1097
01:39:39,429 --> 01:39:40,917
Do you feel ashamed of me?

1098
01:39:42,295 --> 01:39:43,295
.no

1099
01:39:44,187 --> 01:39:45,756
Why did you let me die?

1100
01:39:49,824 --> 01:39:50,867
Why didn't you save me?

1101
01:39:50,892 --> 01:39:52,205
It's not my fault.

1102
01:39:52,285 --> 01:39:53,591
You could have asked for help

1103
01:39:53,622 --> 01:39:54,871
stop. stop

1104
01:39:54,960 --> 01:39:56,547
- But you didn't call. - Stop it

1105
01:39:56,679 --> 01:39:57,690
.and i wish i was dead

1106
01:39:57,745 --> 01:39:59,765
Because I was afraid of you.

1107
01:39:59,766 --> 01:40:01,755
I was 10 years old

1108
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:05,216
.You were wild

1109
01:40:08,276 --> 01:40:10,881
And I know it wasn't fair

1110
01:40:10,921 --> 01:40:12,949
That you needed help.

1111
01:40:14,883 --> 01:40:16,377
But I couldn't.

1112
01:40:21,246 --> 01:40:23,158
You took the guilt

1113
01:40:24,506 --> 01:40:27,806
all my life

1114
01:40:32,924 --> 01:40:34,587
I have to get rid of this

1115
01:40:36,855 --> 01:40:38,385
I have to get rid of this

1116
01:40:45,365 --> 01:40:46,796
It's not real.

1117
01:40:47,818 --> 01:40:49,042
(But oh (Rose .)

1118
01:40:50,168 --> 01:40:53,671
Your brain makes it real

1119
01:40:58,083 --> 01:40:59,083
What are you?

1120
01:41:00,895 --> 01:41:02,347
Why do you do this to me?

1121
01:41:03,484 --> 01:41:04,729
..because your mind

1122
01:41:06,325 --> 01:41:07,891
.Very attractive

1123
01:41:59,222 --> 01:42:02,474
You can't escape your mind, Rose.

1124
01:42:09,347 --> 01:42:10,356
It's a

1125
01:42:12,702 --> 01:42:15,188
.it's my mind

1126
01:42:22,924 --> 01:42:24,749
And you can't escape from it either

1127
01:44:10,088 --> 01:44:11,588
.the curse

1128
01:44:14,331 --> 01:44:15,528
are you OK?

1129
01:44:16,002 --> 01:44:16,940
May I come in for a moment?

1130
01:44:16,979 --> 01:44:18,013
.Yes Yes

1131
01:44:24,804 --> 01:44:25,804
where have you been?

1132
01:44:30,897 --> 01:44:31,964
.I'm sorry

1133
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:36,237
..sorry because I

1134
01:44:36,554 --> 01:44:39,986
I pushed you into all my mess

1135
01:44:42,306 --> 01:44:43,758
for most of my life

1136
01:44:44,175 --> 01:44:45,628
..I was afraid

1137
01:44:46,661 --> 01:44:49,790
to get people close to me

1138
01:44:51,110 --> 01:44:53,047
..because I was afraid

1139
01:44:56,599 --> 01:44:58,739
What would they see if they looked closely?

1140
01:44:59,631 --> 01:45:02,078
So, I put barriers around me

1141
01:45:02,512 --> 01:45:04,305
.and keep people away from me

1142
01:45:07,294 --> 01:45:08,294
and then

1143
01:45:12,098 --> 01:45:14,223
your ability and

1144
01:45:15,053 --> 01:45:17,451
And it felt like those
barriers were collapsing

1145
01:45:18,202 --> 01:45:19,893
And it scared me so much.

1146
01:45:23,589 --> 01:45:24,589
, so

1147
01:45:26,124 --> 01:45:28,374
I was selfish

1148
01:45:28,532 --> 01:45:32,281
And he wasn't fair to you

1149
01:45:34,367 --> 01:45:37,381
.and I'm so sorry

1150
01:45:39,322 --> 01:45:41,811
And I'm being selfish again,

1151
01:45:41,860 --> 01:45:44,884
..when I ask this but do you think

1152
01:45:45,798 --> 01:45:47,985
..May I stay here

1153
01:45:50,644 --> 01:45:51,656
just sleep?

1154
01:45:55,475 --> 01:45:56,545
Can you

1155
01:45:58,341 --> 01:46:00,731
Stay with me while I sleep?

1156
01:46:04,643 --> 01:46:05,643
.I beg you

1157
01:46:07,714 --> 01:46:09,288
