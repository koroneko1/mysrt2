1:16:39.598 --> 1:16:41.033
Hello, June.

1:16:43.802 --> 1:16:46.033
I'm Marjorie Wallace.

1:16:46.136 --> 1:16:49.646
A reporter for<i> The Sunday Times.</i>

1:16:49.748 --> 1:16:51.906
I don't know if you were
allowed to read the article

1:16:52.008 --> 1:16:54.244
I wrote about your trial.

1:17:00.819 --> 1:17:03.255
I've read your writing.

1:17:03.357 --> 1:17:06.388
<i>Pepsi-Cola Addict </i> had me up
the other night until 4:00 a.m.

1:17:08.233 --> 1:17:09.930
I couldn't put it down.

1:17:12.097 --> 1:17:14.533
You have an extraordinary
imagination.

1:17:15.069 --> 1:17:18.469
The vision of Preston drowning
in Pepsi-Cola.

1:17:18.571 --> 1:17:19.737
(laughs softly)

1:17:19.839 --> 1:17:21.975
You're very good with tension.

1:17:23.979 --> 1:17:26.716
I should like to read
more of your writing.

1:17:32.816 --> 1:17:34.856
If you were...

1:17:35.821 --> 1:17:37.991
telling your story...

1:17:39.691 --> 1:17:41.995
through me...

1:17:42.864 --> 1:17:45.130
...how would you want yours
to begin?

1:18:03.453 --> 1:18:05.515
Perhaps I would start...

1:20:24.929 --> 1:20:26.794
Please tell the doctor
that June must come back.

1:20:26.896 --> 1:20:29.294
We want to be together.
It's not right.

They are writers. You know that.

1:29:19.957 --> 1:29:22.426
Marjorie, they just can't
help themselves.

1:29:22.528 --> 1:29:24.830
They don't even seem to want to.

1:29:24.932 --> 1:29:27.995
When they can show that they do,
I will happily hand them over.

1:29:28.098 --> 1:29:30.932
But neither of us have
any control over that.

1:29:31.034 --> 1:29:33.240

anytime soon.
