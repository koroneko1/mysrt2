<i>[Boy] In a world
full of superheroes,</i>

00:31.631 --> 00:33.997
<i>there are two
that stand above the rest:</i>

00:34.067 --> 00:35.694
<i>The Commander and Jetstream. </i>

00:35.769 --> 00:38.738
<i>His super-strength makes him
pretty much indestructible. </i>

00:38.805 --> 00:40.705
<i>She has the power of supersonic flight</i>

00:40.774 --> 00:43.470
<i>along with a total mastery
of unarmed combat. </i>

00:43.543 --> 00:46.103
<i>By day, they live
as Steve and Josie Stronghold,</i>

00:46.179 --> 00:49.273
<i>the top real estate agents
in the metropolis of Maxville. </i>

00:49.349 --> 00:52.785
<i>But whenever duty calls, they are
the Commander and Jetstream. </i>

00:52.852 --> 00:54.979
<i>Me, I have my
own names for them:</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:57.785
<i>Mom and Dad. 
That's me in the middle. </i>

00:57.857 --> 01:00.553
<i>You look at them and see
the defenders of the world. </i>

01:00.627 --> 01:03.221
<i>All I see is my dad
wearing tights. </i>

01:03.296 --> 01:06.561
<i>Don't get me wrong. It can be cool
to have superhero parents,</i>

01:06.633 --> 01:10.660
<i>like when Mom picks up awesome takeout
on her way home from work. </i>

01:10.737 --> 01:13.797
<i>On the other hand,
living up to the family name</i>

01:13.873 --> 01:17.172
<i>means that I'm supposed
to save the world someday. </i>

01:17.243 --> 01:18.574
Here we go.

Come on.

01:40.967 --> 01:43.435

- [Beeping]
- Well, that was Bert Timmerman

01:46.339 --> 01:48.807
and he is buying the colonial
on Pine Terrace.

01:48.875 --> 01:51.639
Above asking.
No contingencies.

01:51.711 --> 01:55.670
Honey, I know that selling real estate
is just our cover,

01:55.748 --> 01:59.809
but I think we're in line to win
that sales trip to Hawaii.

01:59.886 --> 02:03.822
We haven't been to Hawaii since
King Kamehamayhem set off that volcano.

02:03.890 --> 02:06.484
Think of it, Josie:
You, me on the beach,

02:06.559 --> 02:08.151
no exploding volcanoes.

02:09.562 --> 02:12.156
Mmm, I can feel the sand
in my toes already.

02:12.232 --> 02:14.632
[Giggling] Will is gonna be down
any minute.

02:14.701 --> 02:17.864
Hey, it's his first day of school.
Where is he?

02:19.973 --> 02:21.497
[Steve] Will?

02:26.212 --> 02:27.201
Will?

02:32.152 --> 02:35.485
Oh! Ah!

02:35.555 --> 02:38.115
Come on, buddy.
Let's get moving!

02:41.361 --> 02:44.626
Oh, hey, Dad. Just trying to
get a few sets in before school.

02:44.697 --> 02:46.221
Low weights, high rep, huh?

02:46.299 --> 02:48.324
Good thinking.
Don't want to bulk up.

02:48.401 --> 02:51.097
Nah, going more for definition.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.466
[Sighs] Big day, huh?

02:54.207 --> 02:56.471
Will? [sighs]

02:56.543 --> 02:58.875
I just want you to know
how proud I am

02:58.945 --> 03:01.243
that you'll be attending
my alma mater

03:01.314 --> 03:04.215
and someday following me
into the family business.

03:04.284 --> 03:06.081
Real estate?

03:06.152 --> 03:07.414
Right.

03:07.487 --> 03:08.476
Real estate.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.254
On a more serious note, son,

03:11.324 --> 03:14.452
I know that every kid
thinks his dad's invincible

03:14.527 --> 03:17.496
and I nearly am,
but who knows?

03:17.564 --> 03:22.592
Maybe the next time I punch
a meteor hurtling toward Earth,

03:22.669 --> 03:26.298
I'll be the one who shatters
into a million pieces.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.637
I- I guess all I'm trying
to say here, Will,

03:29.709 --> 03:32.940
is it's nice to know
that whatever happens to me,

03:33.012 --> 03:35.378
you'll still be around
to save the world.

03:36.983 --> 03:39.349
- Looking forward to it.
- We all are.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.726
- Good morning, Mrs. Stronghold.
- Mornin'.

03:49.796 --> 03:51.991
I noticed you had
recyclables in the trash.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.158
I took the liberty
of moving them for you.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.168
Thank you, Layla.
You hungry?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.966
I've got plenty of eggs, bacon.

03:59.038 --> 04:02.371
No, thanks. You know how my mom
can communicate with animals?

04:02.442 --> 04:05.036
Apparently, they
don't like being eaten.

04:05.111 --> 04:07.739
- How about some juice?
- Great.

04:07.814 --> 04:10.305
He's on his way.
Oh, hi, Layla.

04:10.383 --> 04:13.250
- Good morning, Commander.
- Commander, huh?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.380
Oh. Thanks, Layla.

04:15.455 --> 04:18.618
[Josie] I can't believe you and
Will are starting high school.

04:18.690 --> 04:22.091

were swimming naked in the kiddie pool.

04:39.946 --> 04:42.107
There's trouble downtown.

04:43.483 --> 04:45.713
Big trouble. Downtown.

04:45.785 --> 04:49.221
Oh, shoot, and I really wanted
to see Will off to the bus.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.656
I remember his first day of preschool.
He wouldn't let go of my leg.

04:52.725 --> 04:54.192
- Mom!
- Oh.

04:54.260 --> 04:55.249
[Steve] Josie.

04:57.196 --> 05:00.324
Oh, Will, uh, a reminder.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.493
A lot of the kids at Sky High

05:02.568 --> 05:05.264
will only have one
superhero parent, not two,

05:05.338 --> 05:08.102
so take it easy on them, huh?
No showing off.

05:08.174 --> 05:10.802
Aw, Dad. Not to worry.
I'll keep it low-key.

05:10.877 --> 05:13.345
Mrs. Rivera?
Josie Stronghold.

05:13.413 --> 05:15.938
I'm gonna need to reschedule
that open house.

12:39.658 --> 12:42.786
In a few moments you will
go through Power Placement

12:42.862 --> 12:45.023
and your own heroic journey
will begin.

12:45.097 --> 12:48.089
- "Power placement"?
- Sounds fascist.

12:48.167 --> 12:51.295
Power Placement: It's how
they decide where you go.

12:51.370 --> 12:53.201
The hero track
or the loser track.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.933
Th-th-there's a loser track?

12:55.007 --> 12:58.408
I believe the preferred term
is "Hero Support. "

12:58.477 --> 13:02.811
For now, good deeds and good luck.
Let the adventure begin.

13:02.882 --> 13:05.612
Comets away!

13:08.988 --> 13:11.354
All right, listen up.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.323
My name is Coach Boomer.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.758
You may know me as "Sonic Boom. "

13:15.828 --> 13:17.261
You may not.

13:17.329 --> 13:19.661
Here's how Power Placement
is gonna work.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.326
You will step up here
and show me your power.

13:22.401 --> 13:25.234
And, yes, you will do so
in front of the entire class.

13:25.304 --> 13:28.671
I will then determine
where you will be assigned.

13:28.741 --> 13:31.266
Hero or sidekick.

13:31.343 --> 13:34.972
Now, every year there are
a few students

13:35.047 --> 13:38.539
or, as I like to call them,
"whiner babies,"

13:38.617 --> 13:40.585
who see fit to question

13:40.653 --> 13:42.848
and to complain
about their placement.

13:42.922 --> 13:46.289
So let's get one thing straight.
My word is law.

13:46.358 --> 13:48.986
My judgment is final,

13:49.061 --> 13:52.724
so there will be
no whiner babies.

13:52.798 --> 13:55.028
- Are we clear?
- [Murmuring]

13:55.100 --> 14:00.766
I said, are we... [roaring] clear?!

14:00.840 --> 14:02.637
[All] Yes, Coach Boomer!

14:02.708 --> 14:04.300
[Whistle blows]

14:04.376 --> 14:06.241
Go-time!

14:08.113 --> 14:10.411
You! What's your name?

14:10.482 --> 14:11.813
L-L-Larry.

14:11.884 --> 14:13.818
Little Larry.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.581
Get up here.

14:18.357 --> 14:21.952
[Layla] What's humiliating him
going to prove? This is so unfair.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.824
If life were to suddenly get fair,

14:23.896 --> 14:26.194
I doubt it would happen
in high school.

14:29.101 --> 14:31.069
[Roaring]

14:35.908 --> 14:38.001
[Roaring]

14:39.178 --> 14:40.167
Car!

14:44.250 --> 14:47.219
Big Larry. Hero!

14:47.286 --> 14:50.346
So he's good.
But I'm better.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.222
[Boomer] Did I say
you were next?

14:53.292 --> 14:55.487
Name's Zach, Coach Boomer.

14:55.561 --> 14:57.825
Try not to drop your clipboard.

15:02.501 --> 15:05.061
Any day now, superstar.

15:05.137 --> 15:07.071
- I'm doin' it.
- Doin' what?

15:07.139 --> 15:09.505
- I'm glowin'.
- I don't think so.

15:09.575 --> 15:12.510
Well, it's easier
to see in a dark room.

15:12.578 --> 15:17.379
Turn off these lights, cup your hands
around your eyes and look real close...

15:17.449 --> 15:20.418
- Sidekick!
- Are you sure you don't want to just...

15:20.486 --> 15:22.181
[roaring] Sidekick!

15:23.155 --> 15:24.622
You! Front and center!

15:24.690 --> 15:26.055
Let me start off by saying

15:26.125 --> 15:29.219
- what an honor it is to...
- Is that your power? Butt-kissery?

15:29.295 --> 15:32.093
Very funny, sir. I've heard
you had a wicked sense of...

15:32.164 --> 15:34.655
- Shut up and power up.
- Right away, sir.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.503
Say, that's
pretty impressive...

15:39.972 --> 15:41.906
...for a Popsicle! Sidekick!

15:42.841 --> 15:43.830
Hero!

15:47.179 --> 15:48.976
Side... kick!

15:50.482 --> 15:51.915
[Boomer] Super spit?

15:51.984 --> 15:54.248
Sidekick.

15:55.554 --> 15:57.044
[Boomer] Acid spit.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.919
Hero!

15:58.991 --> 16:01.619
Ho! Hero!

16:01.694 --> 16:03.753
And a handsome one at that.

16:03.829 --> 16:06.889
Get out of here, knucklehead!

16:06.966 --> 16:08.957
[Boomer] Purple kid. Let's go.

16:11.870 --> 16:14.395
- What's your shtick?
- I'm a shape-shifter.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.634
OK. Shift it.

16:18.344 --> 16:19.777
[Squeaking]

16:19.845 --> 16:21.972
- A guinea pig?
- [Magenta] Yep.

16:22.047 --> 16:24.015
Not even a swarm
of guinea pigs?

16:24.083 --> 16:25.277
Uh, no.

16:25.351 --> 16:28.184
Sidekick. Shoo!

16:28.253 --> 16:31.916
- Bite me.
- You. Flower child. Let's go.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.791
Uh, I believe in only using my powers
when the situation demands it.

16:35.861 --> 16:36.919
Well, you're in luck.

16:36.996 --> 16:39.157
This is the situation,
and I'm demanding it.

16:39.231 --> 16:42.962
But to participate in this test
would be to support a flawed system.

16:43.035 --> 16:45.936
The whole hero-sidekick dichotomy
only serves to...

16:46.005 --> 16:47.370
Let me get this straight.

16:47.439 --> 16:50.931
- Are you refusing to show your powers?
- It's more complicated.

16:51.010 --> 16:52.477
[Echoing] Sidekick!

16:52.544 --> 16:55.172
- [Bell rings]
- We'll pick it up right after lunch,

16:55.247 --> 16:57.215
starting with you.

16:58.984 --> 17:00.349
[Zach] That's not cool.

17:00.419 --> 17:01.800
I tell you, Boomer will regret
making me a sidekick.

17:01.835 --> 17:03.181
I tell you, Boomer will regret
making me a sidekick.

17:03.255 --> 17:05.086
All right?
Someday it'll be dark,

17:05.156 --> 17:07.147
he'll be all alone,
walking to his car.

17:07.226 --> 17:10.194
He'll drop his keys, and I
won't glow to help him find 'em.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.059
You got a problem with me?

17:12.131 --> 17:14.622
- Uh, no.
- No what?

17:14.700 --> 17:17.760
No, sir. No, sir! No, sir!

17:17.836 --> 17:19.565
Just messin' with you, sidekick.

17:19.637 --> 17:21.538
[Chuckles]

17:21.607 --> 17:24.804
You're not supposed to use your powers
outside of the school gym!

17:24.877 --> 17:28.938
<i>[Over PA] The cafeteria staff requests
sidekicks stop ordering hero sandwiches. </i>

17:29.014 --> 17:31.380
Am I crazy, or is that guy
really looking at me?

17:33.585 --> 17:35.485
- [Zach] Dude.
- [Will] What?

17:35.554 --> 17:37.920
- That's Warren Peace.
- That's Warren Peace?

17:37.990 --> 17:39.981
- Yeah.
- [Layla] I've heard about him.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.517
His mom's a hero and his dad's
a supervillain. Baron Battle.

17:43.595 --> 17:44.584
Where do I come in?

17:44.663 --> 17:47.564
Your dad busted his dad.
Quadruple life sentence.

17:47.633 --> 17:52.332
- No parole until after his third life.
- [Sighs] That's great.

17:52.404 --> 17:55.840
My first day of Sky High, and
I already have an archenemy. Hmm.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.600
Is he still lookin'?

17:59.678 --> 18:01.111
- No.
- No?

18:01.180 --> 18:03.580
No.

18:06.151 --> 18:08.176
I thought you said
he wasn't looking.

18:08.253 --> 18:13.384
<i>[Over PA] A reminder: There is
no smoking on school grounds,</i>

18:13.459 --> 18:16.292

[Grunts]

18:17.663 --> 18:18.857
I'm...

18:18.931 --> 18:20.091
Will Stronghold.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.090
Aha! Mind reader!

18:23.168 --> 18:24.795
No. Name tag.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.031
Right. Uh...

18:27.106 --> 18:29.165
Uh, these are my friends.
That's Zach.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.833
- [Zach] What's up?
- And...

18:30.909 --> 18:32.706
Layla. Got it.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.075
- I'm Gwen.
- [Layla] Hi.

18:34.146 --> 18:35.875
- I love your skirt.
- Th-Thanks.

18:35.948 --> 18:40.282
- How's Power Placement going?
- Um... great.

18:40.352 --> 18:42.445
I'm not surprised.

18:42.521 --> 18:45.319
I need a freshman rep
for the homecoming committee...

18:45.390 --> 18:47.085
<i>[# Cary Brothers: True]</i>

18:47.159 --> 18:50.617
...we could talk about it over lunch.
- I eat lunch.

18:50.696 --> 18:53.631
[Chuckles] How cute is he?

18:53.699 --> 18:57.066
- I guess I'll see you guys around.
- [Will] Yeah.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.467
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:59.538 --> 19:02.302
[Layla] I don't think she
really liked my skirt.

19:12.217 --> 19:14.447
[Toilet flushes]

19:15.320 --> 19:16.548
See you.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.715
And thanks for the swirly.

19:20.058 --> 19:22.185
- What's up, guys?
- The kid, uh,

19:22.261 --> 19:24.024
looked a little dehydrated.

19:24.096 --> 19:27.259
How about it, Stronghold?
You gonna hang with us this year?

19:27.332 --> 19:29.596
Help us bring some pain
to the sidekicks?

19:29.668 --> 19:32.535
[Stammering] That sounds like... fun.

19:32.604 --> 19:33.730
Hmm.

19:33.805 --> 19:36.273
Good man.
See you around.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.569
OK.

19:38.911 --> 19:41.471
- [Lash chuckles]
- [Bell rings]

19:46.818 --> 19:48.183
[Will sighs]

19:52.958 --> 19:54.755
[Will]... what it actually is...

19:54.826 --> 19:57.522
What do you mean, you don't
know what your power is?

19:57.596 --> 19:59.894
- Well, uh...
- [Boomer laughs]

19:59.965 --> 20:02.092
I got it. You're messin'
with the coach.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.067
Just like your old man! Car!

20:04.136 --> 20:06.127
[Beeping]

20:07.906 --> 20:09.237
- Wow!
- That was close!

20:09.308 --> 20:10.570
Are you insane?!

20:10.642 --> 20:13.236
I don't have super-strength!

20:17.316 --> 20:18.510
Oh, I get it.

20:18.584 --> 20:22.247
You're a flier, just like your ma.
Why didn't you say so?

20:22.321 --> 20:24.789
- [Beeping]
- Whoa!

20:24.856 --> 20:26.983
[Grunting]

20:28.560 --> 20:30.926
Quit messin' around.
I haven't got all day.

20:30.996 --> 20:33.692
- What's your power?
- I don't have one.

20:34.766 --> 20:36.825
Stronghold.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.530
[Roaring] Siiiide...

20:41.907 --> 20:43.898
...kick!

20:48.380 --> 20:52.043
Hmm. I remember doing this to
your father when he was just your age.

20:52.117 --> 20:53.709
Kicked me through that wall!

20:54.853 --> 20:57.014
You, uh, haven't called him yet,
have you?

20:57.089 --> 21:00.889
Like I want to be the one to tell the
Commander his son has no powers?

21:00.959 --> 21:03.757
[Chuckles] Ooh!

21:03.829 --> 21:06.559
Let's... Let's take
a look at that chest.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.565
[Whirring]

21:12.738 --> 21:15.536
Well, nothing
seems to be broken.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.939
Except for me
not having my powers.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.501
Well,

21:20.579 --> 21:22.877
maybe you're
just a late bloomer.

21:22.948 --> 21:25.712
You could get one of them or both.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.753
Your mother's flying
or your father's super-strength.

21:28.820 --> 21:30.481
But when?

21:30.555 --> 21:35.151
The kids who get bit by,
uh, radioactive insects

21:35.227 --> 21:36.956
or fall into a vat
of toxic waste,

21:37.029 --> 21:42.331
their powers usually show up
the next day. Or... they die.

21:43.168 --> 21:44.430
Ooh, lookit.

21:44.503 --> 21:48.530
But kids who
inherit their powers...

21:50.642 --> 21:52.974
...well, impossible to say.

21:53.045 --> 21:55.172
But I will get them, right?

21:55.247 --> 21:56.737
Many sidekicks

21:56.815 --> 21:59.909
are the offspring
of one super-parent, mmm,

21:59.985 --> 22:03.546
and one ordinary parent.
Hmm!

22:03.622 --> 22:05.852
But there are cases, rare,

22:05.924 --> 22:07.721
yet not unheard of,

22:07.793 --> 22:11.092
where the child of two
super-powered parents,

22:11.163 --> 22:13.188
mmm-mmm,

22:13.332 --> 22:16.495
never acquires

22:16.568 --> 22:20.026
any... powers

22:20.105 --> 22:23.199
whatsoever.

22:23.275 --> 22:24.537
There are?

22:24.609 --> 22:26.008
Like who?

22:26.078 --> 22:29.445
Well, I know of only one.
Ron Wilson, bus driver?

22:30.515 --> 22:31.504
There he is.

22:32.684 --> 22:34.049
There he is now.

22:35.120 --> 22:36.747
[Glass shattering]

22:38.690 --> 22:42.683
A three-and-a-half bath Victorian
with original crown molding?

22:42.761 --> 22:45.161
You bet we'd love to take
a look. How's, uh...

22:45.230 --> 22:49.064
When do we brief the president
on supervillain infiltration of the IRS?

22:49.134 --> 22:51.694
President would be Monday.

22:51.770 --> 22:54.534
Tuesday? Great.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.506
No, thank you, Linda.

22:56.575 --> 23:00.170
Hon, dinner's almost ready. Could you
stop playing with your robot eye

23:00.245 --> 23:02.736
- and help set the table?
- Sure.

23:02.814 --> 23:04.543
- Oh, there he is!
- Hey.

23:04.616 --> 23:07.210
- [Steve] Man of the hour!
- Well, how'd it go?

23:07.285 --> 23:09.048
Um, Dad, we need to talk.

23:09.121 --> 23:11.112
You mean a little
hero-to-hero talk?

23:11.189 --> 23:14.386
I think I know just the place.
Come on.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.428
Hon?

23:20.665 --> 23:24.396
- OK, so, Dad...
- Oh, this isn't the place, Will.

23:24.469 --> 23:27.996
- This...
- [whirring]

23:28.073 --> 23:29.768
...is the place.

23:30.776 --> 23:34.542
No way! The secret sanctum?

23:34.613 --> 23:38.242
You know, I'll never forget
my first day at Sky High.

23:38.316 --> 23:41.012
Your grandfather
finally trusted me enough

23:41.086 --> 23:44.453
to give me the key
to his secret sanctum.

23:44.523 --> 23:47.253
'Course, in those days,
we still used keys.

23:47.325 --> 23:48.519
Go ahead, son.

23:48.593 --> 23:52.029
I already added your
biometrics this morning.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.797
Oh, Will, one thing.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.665
'Course, you must never ever

23:58.737 --> 24:00.796
bring anyone into
the secret sanctum.

24:00.872 --> 24:04.774
That's why it's called
the secret... sanctum.

24:06.611 --> 24:07.737
Uh, I would never.

24:08.747 --> 24:10.146

24:23.462 --> 24:24.952
Oh, this one's mine, Will.

24:25.030 --> 24:27.362
- You can use Mom's.
- Sorry.

24:32.904 --> 24:34.394
No way.

24:35.407 --> 24:36.874
You've got a pool table?

24:36.942 --> 24:39.433
- How about the pinball machine?
- [Both laugh]

24:39.511 --> 24:42.036
- Man.
- Let's see. Where do I start?

24:42.113 --> 24:45.776
Uh, I don't know.
Over here we got Mom's stuff.

24:45.851 --> 24:49.014
Uh, scientific equipment,
gadgetry, whatnot.

24:49.087 --> 24:52.250
Will? Oh. Yeah.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.292
All our greatest battles.

24:54.359 --> 24:55.587
Our finest moments.

24:55.660 --> 24:57.218
Ticranium's head.

24:57.295 --> 25:00.389
Exo's number one bug-bot.

25:00.465 --> 25:04.458
- And is this, uh...?
- Royal Pain's Pacifier.

25:04.536 --> 25:06.834
Now that was
a great day, Will.

25:06.905 --> 25:10.272
The first time your mom and I
ever teamed up to fight evildoers.

25:10.342 --> 25:14.608

window, I knew she was the one for me. </i>

25:14.679 --> 25:18.547

We were fantastic!</i>

25:18.617 --> 25:21.279
<i>Royal Pain got his,
and I got the Pacifier. </i>

25:22.721 --> 25:26.919
And this is
my proudest possession.

25:26.992 --> 25:29.654
- Oh. Well, it's amazing.
- Well. [chuckles]

25:29.728 --> 25:31.855
- What's it do?
- No idea.

25:31.930 --> 25:35.058
So this is it.
It's all down here.

25:35.133 --> 25:36.862
Our story, your mom and me,

25:36.935 --> 25:39.870

and takin' names, huh?

25:39.938 --> 25:42.168
But now it's time

25:42.240 --> 25:44.572
for a new chapter in the story.

25:46.011 --> 25:49.344
The three of us,
fighting crime together

25:49.414 --> 25:54.909
side by side... by side.

25:54.986 --> 25:58.547
Now, what was it you
wanted to tell me about?

25:58.623 --> 26:00.386
Oh, um...

26:01.927 --> 26:04.122
...that I'm gonna
kick your butt at pool!

26:04.195 --> 26:06.129
- Well, we'll see about that!
- OK.

[Man] You were right.
[Laughs]

26:20.946 --> 26:22.345
He took it home.

the size of a giant robot.

- Hey, Layla.
- Hi.

26:49.007 --> 26:51.532
So where were you after school?
I was worried.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.272
I got stuck in the nurse's office.

26:54.346 --> 26:57.110
And the news just keeps
getting better and better.

26:57.182 --> 26:59.616
Turns out I may never
get my powers.

27:01.052 --> 27:03.282
How'd your dad take it?

27:03.355 --> 27:07.223
What was I supposed to do?
He showed me the secret sanctum.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.419
You have to tell them.

27:09.494 --> 27:12.793
My parents are the greatest
superheroes on the planet.

27:12.864 --> 27:14.957
Everybody expects
greatness from me.

27:15.033 --> 27:17.194
Well, you are great.

27:17.268 --> 27:18.701
Thanks.

27:20.071 --> 27:22.232
OK, so you're a sidekick.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.639
It's not the end of the world.

27:24.709 --> 27:27.337

27:28.480 --> 27:29.777

27:31.016 --> 27:33.746
I can't make lemons.
I don't know what it is.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.046
Yeah, but see, no.

27:36.121 --> 27:39.181
You have an awesome power.
You could have made hero easy.

27:39.257 --> 27:40.952
I'm not into labels.

27:41.026 --> 27:43.494
But why would you
choose to be a sidekick?

27:43.561 --> 27:47.088
Because I think
the whole thing is stupid.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.963
Dividing people into groups
like that. I mean...

27:50.035 --> 27:52.595
...what is this?
- High school?

28:15.894 --> 28:18.260
'Course, nowadays...

28:18.329 --> 28:20.354
Ooh!

28:20.432 --> 28:23.526
...I just go by Mr. Boy.

28:23.601 --> 28:25.694
But this year,
it will be my privilege

28:25.770 --> 28:27.362
to help each of you become

28:27.439 --> 28:30.237
the very best hero support
that you can be.

28:30.308 --> 28:32.606
Without hero support,

28:32.677 --> 28:35.840
why, there wouldn't be any heroes.

28:35.914 --> 28:38.542
All right, there probably
would be heroes,

28:38.616 --> 28:40.982
but they would be very lonely.

28:41.052 --> 28:44.749
Lonely heroes indeed.
And...

28:45.557 --> 28:46.683
Yes?

28:46.758 --> 28:48.055
Uh, yeah, um,

28:48.126 --> 28:50.617
when do we pick
our names and costumes?

28:50.695 --> 28:53.323
Because I call dibs
on "Zach Attack. "

28:53.398 --> 28:55.866
Well, you don't get to pick.

28:55.934 --> 28:59.267
On graduation day,
you'll be assigned to your hero,

28:59.337 --> 29:02.067
and then he or she will, uh,

29:02.140 --> 29:05.507
decide what you will be called
and what you will wear.

29:05.577 --> 29:09.377
I think this is mostly done in an
attempt to avoid clashing colors.

29:09.447 --> 29:13.076
That's why when
I was paired with...

29:13.151 --> 29:15.813
...the Commander,
red, white and blue it was,

29:15.887 --> 29:18.879
which for me was a very
good thing because,

29:18.957 --> 29:22.552
uh, as you can see, blue
really just makes my eyes pop!

29:22.627 --> 29:24.561
- It's very dramatic.
- Huh.

29:24.629 --> 29:28.292
Uh, excuse me. I didn't know
you worked for the Commander.

29:28.366 --> 29:30.596
<i>I worked with the Commander.</i>

29:30.668 --> 29:34.229

29:40.779 --> 29:42.337
Stronghold.

29:42.413 --> 29:44.404
You Steve's son?

29:44.482 --> 29:46.677
Yeah.

29:46.751 --> 29:48.582
And he never
mentioned me to you.

29:48.653 --> 29:50.450
I don't... I don't think so.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.217
Makes sense.

29:52.290 --> 29:55.054
That makes perfect sense,
because the Commander

29:55.126 --> 29:58.459
does not have time to sit around
flipping through scrapbooks

29:58.530 --> 30:00.794
that I took the time
to make for him.

30:00.865 --> 30:04.130
No, the Commander's got to be
out there saving the world!

30:04.202 --> 30:06.602

- you hand it to him.
- Or her.

By the way, Zach,

To just feel that once.

36:42.066 --> 36:44.694
That's a lot to put on
a 14-year-old's shoulders.

36:44.769 --> 36:46.464
Oh, come on, Josie!

36:46.537 --> 36:49.472
When I was his age, I could
put a truck on my shoulders.

36:50.107 --> 36:51.233
Oh!

36:51.309 --> 36:53.777
Honey, I know
you're disappointed.

36:53.844 --> 36:56.677
So am I. You think I didn't
want to see my son fly?

36:56.747 --> 36:58.874
- Or have super-strength?
- Or fly?

36:58.950 --> 37:01.350
But we can't change who he is.

37:01.419 --> 37:03.910
Not without dropping him
in a vat of toxic waste.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.618
- Steve!
- Aw... Oh, no, no...

37:07.692 --> 37:09.592
Where would we even find a vat of...

37:09.660 --> 37:12.185
- Steve!
- I-I just, I'm thinking.

37:12.263 --> 37:13.355
Will is a great kid.

37:13.431 --> 37:16.093
This is not the end
of the world. OK.

37:16.167 --> 37:18.567
So maybe we won't be
the Stronghold Three,

37:18.636 --> 37:22.402
the greatest family of superheroes
the world has ever known.

37:22.473 --> 37:24.703
But we will be
the Stronghold Three,

37:24.775 --> 37:28.040
the greatest family
the world has ever known.

37:28.112 --> 37:29.443
You're right.

37:29.513 --> 37:32.209
You're right, and he can
always go into real estate!

37:33.251 --> 37:34.946
Welcome to Sky Hi...

37:38.522 --> 37:40.080
[Lash] Come on, Ron.

37:40.157 --> 37:42.057
Hey, big boy.
Where's your hat?

37:42.126 --> 37:43.457
Hey, where's your hat?

37:43.527 --> 37:46.291
If you're not gonna respect me,
at least respect the hat!

37:46.364 --> 37:49.197
- Oh, pfff!
- Guys. Guys, come on.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.531
Give Ron his hat back.

37:51.602 --> 37:53.661
All right.
You're the sidekick.

37:53.738 --> 37:55.433
Give him his hat back.

38:00.011 --> 38:02.980
[Speed] We'll catch you later,
Stronghold. [laughing]

38:03.047 --> 38:04.571
Hey, race you up the steps.

38:04.649 --> 38:06.583
Thanks, Will.

38:06.651 --> 38:07.879
Sure, Ron.

38:11.889 --> 38:13.982
- [Layla] Over here!
- Saved you a seat!

38:14.058 --> 38:15.616
Hey, and I saved you a pudding!

38:17.928 --> 38:21.022
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, buddy. Check this out.

38:23.167 --> 38:24.794
Whoa!

38:29.707 --> 38:32.972
- Uh... sorry.
- You will be.

38:33.044 --> 38:34.136
Let's not do this.

38:34.211 --> 38:37.578
You think you can do whatever
you want 'cause your name's Stronghold?

38:37.648 --> 38:39.809
I'm sorry my dad
put your dad in jail, but...

38:39.884 --> 38:42.648
Nobody talks about my father.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.318
Ah!

38:45.156 --> 38:46.748
Oh, it is so on!

38:48.559 --> 38:52.495
- [Kids chanting] Fight, fight, fight!
- Mr. Boy, do something!

38:54.565 --> 38:56.726
I'm on it!

38:56.801 --> 38:58.666
Principal Powers!

38:58.736 --> 39:01.296
Principal Powers!
Principal Powers!

39:01.372 --> 39:04.830
Principal Powers!
Principal Powers!

39:04.909 --> 39:06.570
[Chanting] Fight, fight, fight!

39:08.746 --> 39:10.179
[Chuckling] Oooh!

39:13.250 --> 39:14.342
[Shrieks]

39:14.418 --> 39:17.512
- [All chattering]
- Hurry up! Move out of the way!

39:28.766 --> 39:30.131
Oh!

39:33.371 --> 39:34.633
[Grunts]

39:49.954 --> 39:51.979
Where are your sidekicks,
sidekick?

39:52.056 --> 39:53.717
[Zach] Right here!

39:53.791 --> 39:55.383
Yeah.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.384
[Grunts]

40:02.833 --> 40:05.233
Leave them alone!

40:09.473 --> 40:10.565
He's strong!

40:11.675 --> 40:12.767
I'm strong?

40:12.843 --> 40:14.640
He's super-strong.

40:20.251 --> 40:21.582
[Cheering]

40:21.652 --> 40:23.313
Yeah, Will!

40:26.357 --> 40:28.188
Now, who tripped me?

40:30.494 --> 40:31.620
Stronghold!

40:45.443 --> 40:49.903
What if I said it's not just her twin?
It's her evil twin.

40:51.248 --> 40:54.547
- This Friday, you say?
- Medulla, you dog!

40:54.618 --> 40:56.609
[Grunting]

40:57.021 --> 40:58.545
[Screaming]

41:01.792 --> 41:04.488
Think I can't take a hit?

41:06.130 --> 41:07.825
[Yelling]

41:14.538 --> 41:16.130
Will!

41:17.374 --> 41:19.706
Will! Pull the pin!

41:19.777 --> 41:21.369
He's comin', man!

41:33.390 --> 41:34.550
Hi.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.092
<i>[Beeping]</i>

41:42.066 --> 41:44.296
I didn't do anything, though.
He started it.

41:44.368 --> 41:46.563
Your dad started it,
and I'm gonna finish it.

41:46.637 --> 41:48.867
- [Clicking]
- [Powers] Don't bother.

41:48.939 --> 41:53.774
The Detention Room neutralizes
all super-powers. Sit.

41:55.079 --> 41:57.946
Now, here at Sky High
we do everything we can

41:58.015 --> 41:59.915
to teach you how
to use your powers.

41:59.984 --> 42:02.316
But what you do with them,
now that's up to you.

42:02.386 --> 42:06.220
Living up to your father's reputation
or trying to live it down

42:06.290 --> 42:10.317
is a sad waste of talent.
Your talent.

42:10.394 --> 42:16.128
Try to keep that in mind the next time
you're about to do something stupid.

42:22.273 --> 42:24.537
[Exhales] All right, look.

42:24.608 --> 42:28.635
Whatever happened with our dads,
it has nothing to do with us.

42:28.712 --> 42:31.078
What do you say?

42:32.283 --> 42:34.114
I say

42:34.184 --> 42:36.778
if you ever cross me again,
I'll roast you alive.

42:50.968 --> 42:52.902
[Gasps]

42:57.041 --> 43:00.533
[Josie] So, Will, anything
interesting happen at school today?

43:00.611 --> 43:02.078
Uh...

43:02.146 --> 43:06.242
Well, as you may have noticed,
I got my powers today!

43:07.718 --> 43:10.949
Yes, we know.
The principal called.

43:11.021 --> 43:13.285
OK. Look, it's not...

43:13.357 --> 43:15.018
It's not as bad as it sounds.

43:15.092 --> 43:19.426
- It's a really funny, great story.
- You nearly destroyed the cafeteria.

43:19.496 --> 43:22.954
Yeah, but, Mom...
I got my powers!

43:23.033 --> 43:25.024
And do you know
how to use them wisely?

43:26.503 --> 43:28.767
Sanctum. Now.

43:32.076 --> 43:35.978
William Theodore Stronghold...

43:37.681 --> 43:39.581
...come here!

43:39.650 --> 43:41.277
You're not mad?

43:41.352 --> 43:44.412
My boy has super-strength!
How can I be mad?

43:44.488 --> 43:45.978
- [Cracking]
- Ow!

43:46.056 --> 43:48.388
I'm sorry. [cracking] Ow!

43:48.459 --> 43:49.892
- You are strong!
- Yeah.

43:49.960 --> 43:54.021
If your mom asks, you tell her
I read you the riot act, and...

43:54.098 --> 43:56.328
...I took away your Xbox.

43:56.400 --> 43:59.563
- But I don't have an Xbox.
- Are you sure?

43:59.637 --> 44:01.832
- Oh! Go ahead.
- When did you...?

44:01.905 --> 44:03.133
- What?
- Open it up!

44:03.207 --> 44:04.606
Here. Here, I'll get it.

44:04.675 --> 44:05.903
All right. Let's see.

44:05.976 --> 44:08.240
[Male voice] The boy
has Stronghold's power.

44:08.312 --> 44:10.872
- It's almost poetic.
- We should crush them now.

44:10.948 --> 44:12.916
- We know he has the weapon.
- Patience!

44:12.983 --> 44:14.917
We have waited this long.

44:14.985 --> 44:17.476
When the time is right,
we'll have our revenge.

44:17.554 --> 44:20.990
You know, time would move
a lot faster if we had an Xbox.

44:21.058 --> 44:22.491
Ah! Uncle! Uncle! Uncle!

44:22.559 --> 44:24.424
- Dude, you made sidekick history!
- Aw. I don't know about that.

44:24.459 --> 44:26.289
- Dude, you made sidekick history!
- Aw. I don't know about that.

44:26.363 --> 44:30.197
No, seriously. From now on,
people mess with us at their own peril.

44:30.267 --> 44:34.226
You're breaking down barriers,
proving we're not heroes and sidekicks.

44:34.304 --> 44:36.101
- We're just people.
- Super people.

44:36.173 --> 44:39.370
- [Bell rings]
- Seats, please.

44:39.443 --> 44:44.847
We have a lot to cover this morning,
starting with motorcycle sidecar basics.

44:44.915 --> 44:47.679
Uh, except for you,
Mr. Stronghold.

44:47.751 --> 44:50.242
Would you gather your gear
and come up here, please?

44:50.320 --> 44:52.550
I've got your new class schedule.

44:54.658 --> 44:58.958
Congratulations. You've been
transferred to the Hero class.

44:59.029 --> 45:02.863
Oh, and by the way, if you should
find yourself needing any hero support,

45:05.502 --> 45:08.733
I still do a little freelance. Ha!

45:08.806 --> 45:10.433
Ha!

45:13.477 --> 45:14.637
But what about them?

45:14.712 --> 45:17.044
- We'll see you on the bus.
- We'll hang at lunch.

45:17.114 --> 45:19.742
Right after you've dunked
Ethan's head in the toilet.

45:19.817 --> 45:24.186
[Sighs] Well, you best not be late.

45:31.929 --> 45:33.260
Just go already.

45:40.337 --> 45:42.066
Rays!

45:42.139 --> 45:44.107
From the silliness
of the shrink ray

45:44.174 --> 45:46.404
to the devastation
of the death ray.

45:46.477 --> 45:49.878
These are the very
foundations of Mad Science.

45:49.947 --> 45:51.778
[Knocking]

45:51.849 --> 45:53.942
Yes? They told me
you were coming.

45:54.017 --> 45:57.612
Unfortunately, all the
lab partners are taken.

45:57.688 --> 46:00.885
I suppose I could pair you
with my teaching assistant.

46:01.825 --> 46:04.293
Miss Grayson?
My apologies.

46:04.361 --> 46:06.625
<i>- [Chimes jingling]
- [# Cary Brothers: True]</i>

46:06.697 --> 46:07.891
[Medulla] Come on.

46:07.965 --> 46:10.229
Come on! Quickly,
quickly, quickly.

46:10.300 --> 46:11.892
Feet! You stepped on my foot!

46:13.237 --> 46:15.398
OK, how's that?

46:15.472 --> 46:18.339
Perfect... if you're building
a heat ray.

46:18.408 --> 46:21.502
You're supposed to be
building a freeze ray.

46:21.578 --> 46:23.512
OK, I have no idea
what I'm doing.

46:23.580 --> 46:25.013
Dreadful technique.

46:25.082 --> 46:28.245
You've confused rays
with beams! D!

46:28.318 --> 46:30.946
Minus! I'd give you an F,

46:31.021 --> 46:34.218
but that would only mean having
to see you in summer school.

46:34.291 --> 46:36.657
- And what have we here?
- Uh...

46:36.727 --> 46:39.696
Well, I don't know.
I didn't do it.

46:39.763 --> 46:42.493
You're far too modest,
Mr. Stronghold.

46:45.836 --> 46:48.168
Or perhaps
not modest enough.

46:48.238 --> 46:50.433
Miss Grayson,
in the future,

46:50.507 --> 46:53.670
please allow the students
to succeed, or fail,

46:53.744 --> 46:55.905
on their own.

46:59.883 --> 47:00.872
How did you do that?

47:00.951 --> 47:01.940
I'm a Technopath.

47:02.019 --> 47:04.579
I can control technology
with my mind.

47:04.655 --> 47:08.523
Wow. All I can do
is punch stuff.

47:08.592 --> 47:11.152
Yet he'll be the one
on cereal boxes.

47:11.228 --> 47:13.594
Show me the justice in that.

47:13.664 --> 47:16.428
Miss Fernandez,
kindly thaw out Mr. Hellman.

47:16.500 --> 47:19.469
- That was amazing.
- So is what you did in the cafeteria.

47:19.536 --> 47:21.629
Yeah. Once they start
handing out grades

47:21.705 --> 47:24.902
for destruction of school property,
I'll be in good shape.

47:24.975 --> 47:28.342
You know, I can totally help you out
with all this science stuff.

47:28.412 --> 47:30.471
[Stammering] Yeah, you'd do that?

47:30.547 --> 47:31.775
Mm-hmm.

47:31.849 --> 47:35.114
I could be, like, your...
private tutor.

47:35.185 --> 47:37.551
Cool.

47:39.456 --> 47:41.720
Guys! Guys! Over here.

47:41.792 --> 47:43.919
Will? Sitting with Gwen Grayson?

47:43.994 --> 47:46.053
Man aims high.
Gotta give him that.

47:48.332 --> 47:50.232
Sorry. All full.

47:52.636 --> 47:53.796
That's OK.

47:53.871 --> 47:56.465
Uh, I think I see
an empty table over there.

47:56.540 --> 47:57.529
Come on, guys.

47:59.243 --> 48:00.369
No offense, Will.

48:00.444 --> 48:03.242
We are not running a loser
outreach program. OK?

48:03.313 --> 48:05.372
[Laughter]

48:07.784 --> 48:09.649
I'm sorry.
Penny can be a little...

48:09.720 --> 48:11.847
...full of herself sometimes.

48:14.691 --> 48:15.783
Penny...

48:18.962 --> 48:22.022
Sometimes you
have to act nice...

48:25.702 --> 48:29.194
- I just don't want them to sit here.
- OK.

48:33.076 --> 48:36.273
Layla! What's up?

48:36.346 --> 48:38.541
Hey, you smell nice.

48:38.615 --> 48:42.244
<i>Tecomaria capensis. 
Honeysuckle?</i>

48:44.021 --> 48:46.319
- Listen. About lunch...
- What about it?

48:46.390 --> 48:48.449
At the table, Penny was being...

48:48.525 --> 48:51.551
- Please. Not a big deal.
- No, it is, and...

48:51.628 --> 48:53.619
I feel bad, so let me
make it up to you.

48:53.697 --> 48:56.427
Maybe tonight we can go
to the Paper Lantern?

48:57.334 --> 49:00.770
- But you hate Chinese food.
- But you don't.

49:01.605 --> 49:04.073
Paper Lantern. 8:00.

49:04.141 --> 49:06.439
Will!

49:06.510 --> 49:07.499
No, guys!

49:07.577 --> 49:09.306
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey!

49:09.379 --> 49:11.870
Come on, buddy.
Easy, guys.

49:11.949 --> 49:13.712
- Thanks, Will.
- All right.

49:13.784 --> 49:15.479
- [Low hum]
- [Layla] You OK?

49:15.552 --> 49:18.146
- Yeah, thanks.
- Zach too.

49:21.024 --> 49:22.548
Come on.

49:22.626 --> 49:25.527
Not so tough when
my boy's around, are you?

49:25.595 --> 49:28.564
You just think you're so big
and bad, huh, Stronghold?

49:28.632 --> 49:31.601
- No, I-I don't.
- Please! Will will totally take you.

49:31.668 --> 49:33.761
You saw what happened to Warren?

49:33.837 --> 49:37.000
Watch it, Stronghold. That big mouth
is gonna get you in trouble.

49:37.074 --> 49:39.838
- I didn't say anything.
- Why not settle this in P.E.?

49:39.910 --> 49:41.434
- What?
- [Ethan] You're on.

49:41.511 --> 49:44.844
If Will beats you in Save the Citizen,
lay off sidekicks for the year.

49:44.915 --> 49:48.874
And if he loses, you can dunk Ethan
in the toilet every day till graduation.

49:48.952 --> 49:51.318
- Yeah! Huh?
- You got yourself a deal.

49:51.388 --> 49:53.652
- Wait, guys, guys.
- Bring it.

49:53.724 --> 49:56.090
C- Come on!
Guys, are you crazy?!

49:56.159 --> 49:58.150
No freshman ever won
Save the Citizen,

49:58.228 --> 49:59.820
and those guys are undefeated!

49:59.896 --> 50:02.456
And you barely know
how to use your powers!

50:02.532 --> 50:04.693
Sorry. Not helping.

50:04.768 --> 50:06.235
Will, you have no choice.

50:06.303 --> 50:09.670
You can't let them dunk Ethan's head
in the toilet. Not again.

50:09.740 --> 50:12.231
The dunking must end.

50:14.745 --> 50:16.804
[Crowd chanting]

50:29.559 --> 50:34.053
Ramirez! Hamilton!
Your citizen has just been mulched

50:34.131 --> 50:36.793
because you failed
to defeat your villains.

50:36.867 --> 50:40.234
Next round. Speed, Lash,
you want to be heroes or villains?

50:40.303 --> 50:41.463
- Villains.
- Yeah.

50:41.538 --> 50:43.335
Ooh, there's a surprise.

50:43.407 --> 50:45.068
Who do you want to beat next?

50:45.142 --> 50:48.168
All right.
We'll take little Stronghold

50:48.245 --> 50:50.213
and, uh, let's see...

50:50.280 --> 50:53.807

- [Chuckling] Yes. Yes.

51:01.591 --> 51:05.550
Hothead, Stronghold,
you're the heroes.

51:06.930 --> 51:09.592
[Warren] Hey!
Get your head in the game!

51:09.666 --> 51:12.260
You have three minutes
to immobilize your opponents

hit the showers!

53:56.266 --> 53:57.756
Where's my boy?

54:00.937 --> 54:02.495
- Will!
- Will!

54:02.572 --> 54:04.699
Whoo!

54:04.774 --> 54:06.503
- Yo, we're right here!
- Here!

54:06.576 --> 54:09.704
I just can't believe you won
Save the Citizen as a freshman.

54:09.779 --> 54:11.508
That's never been done before!

54:11.581 --> 54:15.210
And you topped Mom's best score on
the pinball machine? Get outta here!

54:15.285 --> 54:18.379
- That is hilarious.
- There they are.

54:18.455 --> 54:20.685
- Gwen?
- Hey.

54:20.757 --> 54:23.419
Oh, uh, Dad,
this is Gwen Grayson.

54:23.493 --> 54:24.926
Gwen Grayson, this is Dad.

54:24.995 --> 54:27.463
Mr. Stronghold,
it's such an honor.

54:27.530 --> 54:29.395
I'm sorry to barge in like this.

54:29.466 --> 54:32.333
Oh, not at all. Will and I
were just hangin'. Chillin'.

54:32.402 --> 54:34.393
Honey, Gwen is a Technopath,

54:34.471 --> 54:37.269
and she's offered to help Will
with his science homework.

54:37.340 --> 54:39.069
And she's a senior.

54:39.142 --> 54:44.136
We said we'd work on that antigravity
stuff tomorrow, but something came up.

54:44.214 --> 54:46.978
- Any chance we can do it tonight?
- Sure. Yeah.

54:47.050 --> 54:50.952
On one condition, Gwen.
You join us for dinner.

54:51.021 --> 54:53.615
Oh, no, I couldn't intrude.

54:53.690 --> 54:56.625
- Oh, yes, you can.
- [Josie] You must.

54:56.693 --> 54:58.593
OK. Well, thanks.

54:59.496 --> 55:02.556
- So should we get started?
- Certainly.

55:10.774 --> 55:12.674
Well, she's gorgeous.

55:12.742 --> 55:14.972
And she fixed the disposal.

55:16.680 --> 55:17.738
Really?

55:17.814 --> 55:20.009
So there we were,
in the middle of nowhere,

55:20.083 --> 55:22.210
and she's like,
"I can't change a tire!

55:22.285 --> 55:24.753
- I can only change the weather!"
- [All laughing]

55:24.821 --> 55:27.381
I'm like, "Can you at least
make it stop raining?"

55:28.658 --> 55:31.889
<i>- [People chattering]

55:38.868 --> 55:42.326
Uh, I'll give him
a few more minutes.

55:49.713 --> 55:51.772
So, Gwen, do we
know your parents?

55:51.848 --> 55:54.510
Mmm. I don't think so,
Mrs. Stronghold.

55:54.584 --> 55:56.779
Dad went inactive a few years ago.

55:56.853 --> 55:59.014
Lets Mom do all the work now, huh?

55:59.089 --> 56:00.556
[Chuckling]

56:00.623 --> 56:02.284
Mom passed away
when I was a baby.

56:02.359 --> 56:04.725
[Spits]

56:04.794 --> 56:07.854
So I did have an ulterior motive
in coming here tonight.

56:07.931 --> 56:11.128
Will told you I'm the head
of the homecoming committee?

56:11.201 --> 56:12.725
Uh, he most certainly did not.

56:13.536 --> 56:17.404
Well, I was wondering if you'd consider
attending the homecoming dance.

56:17.474 --> 56:20.170
- We would love to chaperone.
- Sure.

56:20.243 --> 56:23.508
That's very nice,
Mrs. Stronghold, but no.

56:23.580 --> 56:26.515
We were hoping that
you'd be the guests of honor

56:26.583 --> 56:29.677
and receive the award
for Heroes of the Year.

56:31.287 --> 56:33.778
<i>[Chinese music plays]</i>

56:43.133 --> 56:44.623
Still workin' on that?

56:46.302 --> 56:48.236
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:48.304 --> 56:50.101
We go to school together.

56:51.274 --> 56:53.504
- You're Stronghold's friend.
- Yeah.

56:53.576 --> 56:55.009
Yeah.

56:55.078 --> 56:57.137
You want me to heat that up for you?

56:58.348 --> 57:01.283
You're not supposed to use
your powers outside of school.

57:01.351 --> 57:05.117
I was just gonna
stick it in the microwave.

57:05.188 --> 57:10.125
Uh, I was supposed to be
meeting Will here, but, um...

57:11.861 --> 57:14.591
You want to sit down?

57:16.633 --> 57:18.760
I think I can spare a minute.

57:24.207 --> 57:26.937
[Layla chuckles]

57:28.278 --> 57:29.768
[Laughing] Oh, look, hon.

57:29.846 --> 57:32.406
There's... What's his name?
Kid with the gravity.

57:32.482 --> 57:34.677
- Lance, I think. Lance something.
- Yeah.

57:34.751 --> 57:37.117
Oh, my gosh, look.
There's Boomer.

57:37.187 --> 57:40.816
- [Will] He had a mullet?!
- Oh, God.

57:40.890 --> 57:42.755
Oh, whoa-whoa-whoa.
Remember her?

57:42.826 --> 57:47.058
- Hmm? She was a weird one.
- [Josie] Oh, yeah. Sue Tenny.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.325
Disappeared right before graduation.

57:49.399 --> 57:51.959
- Why is that?
- No one ever really knew.

57:52.035 --> 57:55.004
Some say she was, uh,
recruiting villains at the school.

57:55.071 --> 57:57.301
Others say she was smoking
in the girls' room.

57:57.373 --> 57:59.136
Nightmare.
All right, now.

57:59.209 --> 58:02.372
Speaking of villains, there's one
of the worst. Baron Battle.

58:02.445 --> 58:03.571
[Will] Warren's dad?

58:03.646 --> 58:06.080
Always swore he'd have
his revenge on me.

58:06.149 --> 58:08.447
<i>And he totally stole
the lead in Oklahoma!</i>

58:08.518 --> 58:10.452
You have to stop
caring about that.

58:10.520 --> 58:12.078
- It's a long time ago.
- Hon.

58:12.155 --> 58:15.352
- Don't wanna talk about it!
- You deserved it.

58:15.425 --> 58:17.518
Then there was this time
in first grade.

58:17.594 --> 58:19.721
You know how you grow
lima beans in school?

58:19.796 --> 58:22.526
Will could not figure out
why mine grew so quickly.

58:22.599 --> 58:25.659
It was driving him crazy.
So finally I took mercy on him

58:25.735 --> 58:29.466
and I told him about my powers,
and we've been best friends ever since.

58:29.539 --> 58:31.370
Hmm.

58:31.441 --> 58:35.400
And falling for him, was that
before or after the lima beans?

58:35.478 --> 58:40.313
What? I am not in love
with Will Strong...

58:40.383 --> 58:42.317
- Is it that obvious?
- Yeah.

58:42.385 --> 58:45.218
- Great.
- So why don't you tell him?

58:45.288 --> 58:47.950
Well, I was gonna
ask him to homecoming,

58:48.024 --> 58:49.685
but there's two problems.

58:49.759 --> 58:52.853
He likes somebody else,
and she's perfect.

58:52.929 --> 58:55.921
Hmm. You know what I think?

58:57.133 --> 59:00.694
To let true love remain unspoken

59:00.770 --> 59:03.568
is the quickest route
to a heavy heart.

59:03.640 --> 59:05.130
Wow.

59:05.208 --> 59:07.301
That is really deep.

59:07.377 --> 59:10.073
Yeah.

59:10.146 --> 59:13.172
And your lucky numbers are...

only find someone to go with.

01:14:28.730 --> 01:14:30.891
Me neither.

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:35.969
Hey there, Layla.

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:38.063
You look like
you could use a drink.

01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.300
No, thanks.

01:14:39.374 --> 01:14:42.810
Oh, don't worry.
The bubbles are just ginger ale.

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:44.573
[Lash] Oops. [laughing]

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:47.740
The guys at this school are jerks!

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:49.807
Thanks a lot.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:53.388
I thought you weren't
gonna rent a tux.

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:57.721
It's my dad's. He doesn't have
much use for it in solitary.

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:00.986
Cheese cube?

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.859
We're taking off now, hon.

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:06.560
Still time to change your mind
and come with us.

01:15:06.635 --> 01:15:08.626
Nah, I don't think so.

01:15:09.938 --> 01:15:12.634
Mom, you ever feel like you
messed something up so bad

01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:14.539
that you'll never
be able to fix it?

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:17.977
People make mistakes, Will.
That's what high school's about.

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:21.812
Heck, that's what life's about.
The key is to learn from them.

01:15:22.718 --> 01:15:24.777
I hope my friends
see it that way.

01:15:24.853 --> 01:15:26.582
If someone is a true friend,

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:29.954
you'd be surprised at how
understanding they can be.

01:15:30.025 --> 01:15:31.014
Thanks.

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:33.118
Do me a favor?
Put this away for me.

01:15:33.195 --> 01:15:35.686
I caught your father
sneaking it out under his cape.

01:15:35.764 --> 01:15:38.927
He's convinced that everyone
wants to reminisce with him.

01:15:39.001 --> 01:15:40.992
- I bet. Will do.
- Love ya.

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:42.866
Have fun.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.581
That's weird.

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:09.195
Gwen?

01:16:11.333 --> 01:16:13.233
Oh, no.

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:17.799
Oh, no.

01:16:17.873 --> 01:16:21.172
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:23.979 --> 01:16:25.776
I gotta get to Sky High.

01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:32.182
[Rock music plays]

01:16:33.555 --> 01:16:35.318
Josie, wait.

01:16:35.390 --> 01:16:38.291
We can't unveil
the Stronghold Three without Will.

01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:40.385
It's just...
it's just not the same.

01:16:40.462 --> 01:16:41.793
Maybe we should fly home.

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:44.593
And we really
don't need another award.

01:16:44.666 --> 01:16:47.396
[Powers] Welcome,
Commander and Jetstream!

01:16:47.469 --> 01:16:50.063
[Cheering]

01:16:57.980 --> 01:17:00.244
Good evening.
First, a quick announcement.

01:17:00.315 --> 01:17:03.648
The owner of the blue cold
fusion-powered jet pack,

01:17:03.719 --> 01:17:05.243
you left your lights on.

01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:08.380
Sorry. Sorry.
Excuse me. Sorry.

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:12.723
And now, please help me welcome
the head of the homecoming committee,

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:16.321
the girl who made all this possible,
Gwen Grayson.

01:17:19.201 --> 01:17:21.066
Thank you, Principal Powers.

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:24.071
And a very special thank you
goes to our guests of honor

01:17:24.139 --> 01:17:27.905
and the recipients of our
first-ever Hero of the Year award,

01:17:27.976 --> 01:17:31.275
- the Commander and Jetstream.
- [Applause]

01:17:32.981 --> 01:17:35.973
And to mark this occasion,
we've planned a special tribute

01:17:36.051 --> 01:17:40.488
to the most powerful super-being
ever to walk the halls of Sky High.

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:42.682
Me!

01:17:56.772 --> 01:17:58.239
Commander? [giggling]

01:18:01.643 --> 01:18:04.111
[Giggling]

01:18:04.179 --> 01:18:05.544
[All gasping]

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:12.244
- Royal Pain is a girl?
- Yes, I'm a girl, you idiot!

01:18:12.320 --> 01:18:14.914
How I ever lost to a fool like you
I'll never know.

01:18:14.990 --> 01:18:16.685
Now prepare to be Pacified!

01:18:16.758 --> 01:18:21.627
Do you honestly think you can kill me
with that little toy gun of yours?

01:18:21.697 --> 01:18:25.599
My dear Commander, who said
anything about killing you?

01:18:27.402 --> 01:18:29.927
[Grunting]

01:18:30.639 --> 01:18:32.903
[Screeching]

01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:37.169
[Crying]

01:18:52.894 --> 01:18:54.054
Ahhh!

01:18:54.129 --> 01:18:56.359
Josie! I've always...

01:18:58.767 --> 01:19:01.031
Rock-a-bye, baby!
[Giggling]

01:19:01.103 --> 01:19:03.435
What'd I miss? Ah!

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.567
[Screaming]

01:19:22.657 --> 01:19:26.559
Boomer! Get the kids out of here!

01:19:26.628 --> 01:19:28.528
Hothead! Find an exit!

01:19:28.597 --> 01:19:30.462
Get as many people out
as you can!

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:33.501
I'll slow her dow...!

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:51.845
Thanks again for the lift, Ron.
Now, if I'm not back in 30 minutes...

01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:53.547
Come in after you! Got it!

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:55.556
I was gonna say go get help.

01:19:55.624 --> 01:19:58.525
Go get help. Got it!
Now get in there!

01:20:01.663 --> 01:20:02.960
Sorry!

01:20:03.031 --> 01:20:06.330
- [Layla] Where are we?
- [Zach] Hey, Warren, how 'bout a torch?

01:20:06.401 --> 01:20:09.063
[Warren] Only if you want
to get barbecued.

01:20:10.939 --> 01:20:13.931
Ladies, if I may.

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:16.170
<i>[Magenta] # Then all
the reindeer loved him #</i>

01:20:16.244 --> 01:20:18.508
- [Ethan] Way to glow, Zach.
- Thanks, man.

01:20:25.587 --> 01:20:26.713
'Sup, kid?

01:20:33.829 --> 01:20:35.922
[Giggling]

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:40.125
You're never gonna
believe this. Gwen...

01:20:40.202 --> 01:20:42.466
- Is Royal Pain's daughter.
- Yeah, and she...

01:20:42.537 --> 01:20:44.300
- Stole the Pacifier.
- Right.

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:47.569
She turned everybody into babies,
including your parents.

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:49.200
OK. That I didn't know.

01:20:49.277 --> 01:20:52.440
This is even more than the great
Will Stronghold can handle.

01:20:52.514 --> 01:20:54.573
She's right.
It's gonna take all of us.

01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:57.015
All of who?
You and Warren?

01:20:57.085 --> 01:20:58.814
The rest of us are only sidekicks.

01:20:58.887 --> 01:21:01.879
Just because you have powers,
that doesn't make you a hero.

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:04.187
Sometimes it just makes you a jerk.

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:06.591
Makes me a jerk.

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:10.222
- I guess what I'm trying to say is...
- We get it. You've been a jerk.

01:21:10.966 --> 01:21:13.093
Layla,

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:16.296
in case my homecoming date
ends up killing me tonight,

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:18.532
I just want you to know...

01:21:18.607 --> 01:21:21.405
[Penny] Isn't that sweet?

01:21:21.476 --> 01:21:24.274
- I hate sweet!
- [Laughing]

01:21:25.714 --> 01:21:27.511
You guys are a part of this too?

01:21:27.582 --> 01:21:30.574
- Why am I not surprised?
- Go take care of Gwen.

01:21:30.652 --> 01:21:32.847
- We'll handle these clowns.
- [Chuckles]

01:21:32.921 --> 01:21:34.479
Go.

01:21:48.103 --> 01:21:51.470
[Whimpering]

01:21:51.539 --> 01:21:52.528
Whoa!

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:55.440
"While pushing down
on the infant restraint,

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:57.410
pinch the two straps together. "

01:21:57.479 --> 01:22:00.744
- Pinch, Royal, pinch.
- Pinch what? Restraint A or B?

01:22:00.815 --> 01:22:03.409
Now you just calm down.
Let's go back to one.

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:08.989
Ahhh!

01:22:10.959 --> 01:22:13.792
Come back and fight! You...

01:22:21.836 --> 01:22:24.236
[Penny] Come on, sidekick!
You gonna fight back?

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:26.740
I don't believe in using
powers for violence.

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:29.038
I don't believe you
even have any powers!

01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:32.671
Go, Penny! Beat Layla!
Go, Penny! Beat Layla!

01:22:34.182 --> 01:22:36.343
You can't hide forever, sidekick!

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.720
[Bubbling]

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:43.814
No way.

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:48.024
Sucks for you!

01:22:48.096 --> 01:22:51.588
[Gurgling]

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:53.998
- [Babies crying]
- [Jester giggling]

01:22:54.069 --> 01:22:56.833
Cootchie-cootchie-coo!

01:23:02.577 --> 01:23:05.307
I take you back,
my dear Commander,

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.314
to your senior year at Sky High,

01:23:07.382 --> 01:23:10.351
a time before anyone knew
what a Technopath was.

01:23:10.418 --> 01:23:14.252
So a brilliant but misunderstood
girl named Sue Tenny

01:23:14.322 --> 01:23:18.952
was written off as a science geek
and stuck in Sidekick class.

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:22.986
She hatched a plan,
so daring, so visionary,

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:25.999
to start her very own
Supervillain Academy

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:30.163
and raise a generation of heroes
from scratch as villains.

01:23:30.238 --> 01:23:33.503
But first she had to destroy
the very institution

01:23:33.575 --> 01:23:36.874
that dared to spurn her genius!

01:23:36.945 --> 01:23:42.042
And now, so many years later,
that plan is complete.

01:23:42.117 --> 01:23:44.017
My only regret:

01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:48.613
That this may be the finest
supervillain speech ever given,

01:23:48.690 --> 01:23:51.488
and you don't even know
what I'm saying.

01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:53.720
[Will] But I do.

01:23:53.795 --> 01:23:58.164
Look. I'm sorry that my parents
destroyed your mom.

01:23:58.233 --> 01:24:01.634
Now put my dad down.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.068
[Cooing]

01:24:03.138 --> 01:24:06.164
No one could defeat Royal Pain.

01:24:06.241 --> 01:24:08.766
When the Pacifier exploded,
I wasn't destroyed.

01:24:08.843 --> 01:24:11.676
I was merely
turned into a baby.

01:24:11.746 --> 01:24:14.408
Stitches took me away
and raised me as his daughter.

01:24:14.482 --> 01:24:17.349
Daddy's little girl.
[Laughing]

01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:20.911
- I told you never to call me that!
- [Whimpers]

01:24:20.989 --> 01:24:22.752
Lunatic!

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.553
[Sighs] That's right.

01:24:24.626 --> 01:24:29.120
Royal Pain wasn't my mother.
Royal Pain is me!

01:24:29.197 --> 01:24:31.324
Oh, my God.

01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:34.261
I made out with an old lady.

01:24:39.541 --> 01:24:40.769
[Grunting]

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:52.151
Yoo-hoo! Right here!

01:24:59.661 --> 01:25:01.151
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:25:04.265 --> 01:25:06.324
Way to go, Popsicle.

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:42.959
Hmm!

01:25:44.439 --> 01:25:45.599
Big mistake.

01:25:57.519 --> 01:25:59.419
[Screaming]

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:06.521
But I thought
you were a sidekick!

01:26:06.594 --> 01:26:08.061
I am a sidekick.

01:26:08.129 --> 01:26:09.596
Don't leave us here to die!

01:26:09.664 --> 01:26:12.394
Royal Pain sabotaged
the antigravity device!

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:14.867
The whole school's
gonna fall out of the sky!

01:26:14.936 --> 01:26:16.927
We only have 10 minutes!

01:26:17.872 --> 01:26:19.339
Here's the antigravity room.

01:26:19.407 --> 01:26:21.432
Didn't Royal Pain
seal off every route?

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:23.204
- What about this conduit?
- Right.

01:26:23.278 --> 01:26:26.076
You'd have to be like
a rat to fit in there.

01:26:32.187 --> 01:26:33.176
Oh, great.

01:26:34.455 --> 01:26:36.184
[Magenta] This is so stupid.

01:26:36.257 --> 01:26:40.250
OK. OK, you're doin' great, Magenta.
Looks great.

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:43.525
Look at those cute little legs.
OK, go about 10 feet.

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:46.226
Yeah, there should be
a opening on your right.

01:26:46.301 --> 01:26:48.565
- [Magenta] Gotcha!
- Find the access panel.

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:51.036
- What?
- It leads to the generator.

01:26:51.105 --> 01:26:52.402
[Magenta] I'm on it!

01:27:04.953 --> 01:27:06.443
Will!

01:27:08.656 --> 01:27:10.317
[Grunts]

01:27:12.193 --> 01:27:15.356
- No!
- [Yelling]

01:27:23.871 --> 01:27:26.704
And there goes your last chance
of stopping me.

01:27:26.774 --> 01:27:29.106
We'll see about that!

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:33.212
- Huh?
- [Will] Surprised?

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:36.273
- So am I.
- You're flying?

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:40.450
That's impossible!

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:43.746
[Grunts]

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:53.832
- [Babies crying]
- [Giggling]

01:27:55.436 --> 01:27:56.698
Ah!

01:27:56.771 --> 01:28:00.298
There's only one person authorized
to transport superheroes.

01:28:00.375 --> 01:28:03.708
- And that's Ron Wilson, bus driver.
- [Grunts]

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:07.839
- [Groaning]
- And I'm Ron Wilson, bus driver.

01:28:07.915 --> 01:28:10.406
I found the generator...
I think.

01:28:10.485 --> 01:28:12.350
Chew the wire to the scrambler.

01:28:12.420 --> 01:28:14.479
Cut the wire connected
to the scrambler.

01:28:14.555 --> 01:28:15.647
- The red one.
- What?

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:16.849
Cut the red wire!

01:28:16.924 --> 01:28:18.789
There's a lot
of red wires down here.

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:30.401
<i>[Beeping]</i>

01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:31.460
Uh-oh.

01:28:36.444 --> 01:28:38.435
[Layla] The school is falling!

01:28:38.513 --> 01:28:40.640
Ahhh!

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:43.515
Chew!

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:01.494
Chew the wire!

01:29:01.569 --> 01:29:03.696
[Straining]

01:29:07.108 --> 01:29:10.635
[Man] All unpacked, and the
movers didn't break a thing.

01:29:10.712 --> 01:29:12.942
Told you we didn't need
that extra insurance.

01:29:13.014 --> 01:29:15.539
- No, I know.
- [Electric whining]

01:29:17.585 --> 01:29:20.452
[Screaming]

01:29:20.521 --> 01:29:22.887
Oh, no!

01:29:22.957 --> 01:29:26.017
[Zach screaming]
It's all on you! Hold me! Hold me!

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:37.337
Ahhh!

01:29:42.076 --> 01:29:43.805
[Straining]

01:29:47.081 --> 01:29:49.777
Whoa. That could have been messy.

01:29:50.918 --> 01:29:52.408
[Will] Good night.

01:29:59.494 --> 01:30:02.088
- Ohh!
- Chester? Chester?

01:30:02.163 --> 01:30:04.757
[Babies crying]

01:30:06.734 --> 01:30:09.862
- Now what?
- Beats me.

01:30:09.937 --> 01:30:12.633
Perhaps I can be
of assistance.

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:16.700
It should only take me a couple
of hours to reconfigure the Pacifier.

01:30:16.778 --> 01:30:21.215
Mr. Peace, would you please
carry me to the Mad Science Lab?

01:30:21.282 --> 01:30:23.773
- Sure.
- And, Mr. Peace.

01:30:23.851 --> 01:30:24.909
Yeah.

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:29.150
Regrettably,
I have made boom-boom.

01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:34.987
People, if you've
already been de-Pacified,

01:30:35.062 --> 01:30:39.590
please find your clothes, grab a baby
and report to the Science Lab.

01:30:39.667 --> 01:30:43.262
Mom? Dad? Guys?

01:30:43.337 --> 01:30:47.273
I just want to say sorry because
this whole thing was my fault.

01:30:47.341 --> 01:30:50.310
- Honey, you can't blame yourself.
- 'Course not.

01:30:50.378 --> 01:30:53.677
How were you supposed to know
your girlfriend was a psychopath?

01:30:53.748 --> 01:30:56.273
No, that's not it. Um,

01:30:56.350 --> 01:30:59.547
you gave me one rule,
and I broke it.

01:30:59.620 --> 01:31:02.987
I took her into the sanctum,
and that's how she got the Pacifier.

01:31:03.057 --> 01:31:07.153
- The whole party was a trap.
- And so was the homecoming, Will.

01:31:07.228 --> 01:31:11.858
We all fell into Royal Pain's trap,
but you defeated her.

01:31:11.933 --> 01:31:15.334
You saved Sky High,
and everyone in her.

01:31:15.403 --> 01:31:20.272
- I didn't do it by myself.
- Excuse me. Steve? Josie?

01:31:20.341 --> 01:31:23.276
Even though it appears Gwen
only came up with this award

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:27.007
as a way to lure you to the dance
and your ultimate doom,

01:31:27.081 --> 01:31:28.981
still it's inscribed, so...

01:31:29.050 --> 01:31:33.009
I'd be honored to accept
this "Hero of the Year" award.

01:31:33.087 --> 01:31:38.184
But I'm afraid this
doesn't belong to us.

01:31:38.259 --> 01:31:40.352
[Josie] It belongs to them.

01:31:40.428 --> 01:31:43.226
The sidekicks.

01:31:43.297 --> 01:31:44.662
I mean, hero support.

01:31:44.732 --> 01:31:48.259
Why don't we just call them
what they really are, Josie?

01:31:49.437 --> 01:31:51.268
Heroes.

01:31:56.210 --> 01:31:58.678
Oh, and, Jonathan?

01:31:58.746 --> 01:32:01.408
Whatever you're teaching them,

01:32:01.482 --> 01:32:03.814
keep teaching them it.

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:05.580
Sure.

01:32:16.998 --> 01:32:18.295
[Powers] What a waste.

01:32:18.366 --> 01:32:21.267
I can't do anything more
to help you.

01:32:21.335 --> 01:32:24.327
I'm not Wonder Woman, you know.

01:32:25.339 --> 01:32:29.298
I went through puberty twice...
for this?

01:32:29.377 --> 01:32:32.039
I have de-Pacified all the babies

01:32:32.113 --> 01:32:35.549
and destroyed
that horrible weapon forever.

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:38.782
Let's boogie!

<i>[# Bowling for Soup:
Melt with You]</i>

01:32:51.365 --> 01:32:53.196
This is so sweet,
I could hurl.

01:32:53.267 --> 01:32:55.633
Tell me about it.

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:57.534
- Do you wanna dance?
- [Zach] Yes!

01:32:57.605 --> 01:33:00.039
I mean, yeah. Yeah.

01:33:27.335 --> 01:33:31.533
<i>[Will] Compared to homecoming,
the rest of the year was pretty boring. </i>

01:33:31.606 --> 01:33:33.631
<i>Gwen and her gang
got what they deserved. </i>

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:35.699
<i>But now nobody wants
to save the citizen. </i>

01:33:35.776 --> 01:33:37.038
Uncle! Uncle!

01:33:37.111 --> 01:33:38.601
<i>Relax. I'm just kidding. </i>

01:33:38.679 --> 01:33:41.614
<i>But they are getting to spend
a lot of quality time together. </i>

01:33:41.682 --> 01:33:45.914
<i>Oh, yeah, and Ron Wilson, bus driver,
fell into a vat of toxic waste. </i>

01:33:45.987 --> 01:33:49.650
<i>He now works for the mayor,
defending the city from giant robots. </i>

01:33:49.724 --> 01:33:52.659
<i>So in the end, my girlfriend

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:57.390
<i>and my best friend
became my girlfriend. </i>

01:33:57.465 --> 01:33:59.490
