[haunting somber music plays]

4
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,500
[woman] Hello.

5
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,166
This is the beginning.

6
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,958
The beginning of a film called The Wonder.

7
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:20,250
The people you are about to meet,

8
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:21,500
the characters,

9
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:25,250
believe in their stories
with complete devotion.

10
00:01:26,375 --> 00:01:28,833
We are nothing without stories.

11
00:01:29,833 --> 00:01:32,458
And so we invite you
to believe in this one.

12
00:01:35,416 --> 00:01:37,791
It is 1862.

13
00:01:38,833 --> 00:01:41,208
We left England, bound for Ireland.

14
00:01:42,208 --> 00:01:45,500
The Great Famine
still casts a long shadow,

15
00:01:46,041 --> 00:01:49,875
and the Irish hold England responsible
for that devastation.

16
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,125
There sits a nurse.

17
00:01:54,333 --> 00:01:56,125
An English nurse…

18
00:01:56,208 --> 00:01:57,541
[timber creaking]

19
00:01:57,625 --> 00:01:59,250
…traveling all on her own.

20
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:03,166
And it's with her, we begin.

[indistinct chatter]

29
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,958
You'll be the English nurse.

30
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:41,708
Will I?

31
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:46,416
Well, I'm due a nun and a nurse,
and… [scoffs] …you're not the nun.

32
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,250
[nurse] No.

33
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,916
-[she sighs]
-Maggie!

34
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,750
I thought I was lodging
with the girl's family,

35
00:03:56,833 --> 00:03:58,000
the O'Donnells.

36
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,125
Sorry to disappoint.

37
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,083
-No, no, I was ju--
-Sure, they'd have nowhere to put you.

38
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,250
The O'Donnells live beyond the village.

39
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,500
You and the nun are to lodge here.

40
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,541
Sorry, but why a nun?

41
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,500
-[Maggie] Welcome to Ireland.
-[nurse] Mm.

42
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,541
-[suitcase thuds]
-[Maggie] Your room.

43
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,416
We'll see you at eight for breakfast.

44
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
[footsteps departing]

45
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,958

46
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:24,833
[sighs softly]

47
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,958
[cutlery clinking nearby]

48
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:49,708
Good morning.

49
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,083
Have you come to do
some experiments on Anna?

50
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:53,500
No.

51
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,500
Do you know her?

52
00:04:55,583 --> 00:04:57,833
Everyone knows everyone here, Mrs. Wright.

53
00:04:57,916 --> 00:04:59,041
Ah.

54
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,916
We shared a desk at school.

55
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:01,916
Did you?

56
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,583
[chuckles softly] You've been blessed
with many daughters, Mrs. Ryan.

57
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,666
Only that one's mine.

58
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,166
The other blessings
belonged to the first Mrs. Ryan.

59
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:12,250
I'd call it "tricked."

60
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,500
Mrs. Wright,

61
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,625
the committee is waiting.

62
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,291
[Maggie] Let her have breakfast.

63
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,208
Please.

64
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:22,750
[haunting ambient music plays]

65
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:24,791
Thank you.

66
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:42,375
-The watch is to last two weeks.
-It's been decided it's two weeks?

67
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:45,041
-Two weeks is too long.
-It's important to be thorough.

68
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,250
The village is overwhelmed
with sightseers and gawkers

69
00:05:48,333 --> 00:05:49,708
coming to stare at the child.

70
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,750
And the newspapers.

71
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:54,916
When will we stop being made a mockery of
thanks to someone's journalistic desires?

72
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,500
-It was a medical paper.
-In a national newspaper.

73
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,250
[Mrs. Wright] May I ask, gentlemen?

74
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:02,583
No one has told me
what precisely is wrong with the girl.

75
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:05,000
[Flynn] Nothing at all.

76
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,125
Very well.

77
00:06:09,791 --> 00:06:11,958
I shall return to my post in England.

78
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,125
Anna O'Donnell doesn't eat.

79
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,625
If a patient in the hospital
refuses to eat, we use force.

80
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,500
The girl is not to be forced.

81
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,083
Nor interrogated or badgered.

82
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:29,333
But she is also not to be denied food
should she ask for it.

83
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:32,250
The girl has lived
miraculously without food

84
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:33,791
since her 11th birthday.

85
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,000
"Miraculously" is not how she's done it.

86
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:39,041
The purpose of the watch is to determine

87
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:43,375
exactly how Anna O'Donnell
has survived without food.

88
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:45,791
So you want us to watch her?

89
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,541
[Sir Otway] Yes.

90
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,083
We are proposing eight-hour shifts,

91
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:54,375
changing over at five in the morning,

92
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:56,875
one in the afternoon, and nine at night.

93
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,541
Does that suit you?

94
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:03,333
[Flynn] There is to be no conferring
between the two of you.

95
00:07:03,416 --> 00:07:05,625
On the 14th day,

96
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,958
you will each present
your separate testimony.

97
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,833
How long exactly has it been
since the last time the girl ate?

98
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,875
Four months.

99
00:07:21,708 --> 00:07:22,791
That's impossible.

100
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,958
[unsettling music plays softly]

101
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:28,333
May I ask why not two nurses,
Dr. McBrearty?

102
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:32,000
Sister Michael
is the second nurse, Mrs. Wright.

103
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:39,125
The O'Donnell family
drew some comfort in the idea of a nun,

104
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,708
as did some of the less

105
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:44,833
scientifically minded members
of the committee.

[panting]

110
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,791
And I assume she's bedridden?

111
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:04,416
Better not to assume.

112
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,625
Here we are.

[water trickling]

124
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,833
-[Rosaleen] Doctor.
-[Dr. McBrearty] Thank you.

125
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,875
May I take your daughter's history,
Mrs. O'Donnell?

126
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:02,666
Sure, what history could a child have?

127
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:05,750
She hasn't eaten in four months.
Is that correct?

128
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,708
That is correct.

129
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,291
And would you describe her as healthy?

130
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,791
Well, she's a little delicate, perhaps.

131
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,416
But she never complains.

132
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:26,416
-[Mrs. Wright] And her appetite?
-[Rosaleen] Never greedy.

133
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,583
May I see the girl, please?

134
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,750
She has visitors at the minute.

135
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,500
[Mrs. Wright] Visitors?

136
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:36,791
All the time.

137
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:40,041
-From all over.
-[door opens]

[Dr. McBrearty] Mr. O'Donnell.

139

How are you?

140
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,500
[Mr. O'Donnell] Doctor.

141
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,125
This is Mrs. Wright.

143
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,458
It means, "You're welcome here."

144

Thank you.

[inhales deeply] Perhaps…

00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,666
I think the watch

147
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,666
may be more appropriately conducted
in a hospital.

148
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:11,541
[Rosaleen] No.

149
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:13,916
You're not taking my wee girl away.

-Uh, for your trouble.

-No trouble.

In the poor box, if you insist.

155
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,875
She's a jewel.

156
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,250
A wonder.

Thank you, Doctor.

My name is Elizabeth Wright.
You may call me Mrs. Wright. May I?

Open, please.

Arms up.

168
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:30,333
Down.

00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,791
Turn around.

170
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,041
Turn around again.

171
00:12:00,541 --> 00:12:02,041
And eyes wide open.

[unsettling somber music plays softly]

173
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,166
You seem well, Anna.

174
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:27,750
Are you nervous at all?

175
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,000
Why should I be nervous?

176
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:35,000
Strangers…

177
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,375
such as myself.

178
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,416
Do you know why I'm here?

179
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,458
To make sure I don't eat.

180
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,958
I'm here to watch.

181
00:12:50,958 --> 00:12:52,416

Do you know the dangers
of a prolonged fast, Anna?

183
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,708
I don't need to eat.

184
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,250
I live on manna.

185
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:10,791
From Heaven.

186
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,125
And how does that feel?

187
00:13:20,375 --> 00:13:21,500
Full.

188
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,750
Your son is not home, Mr. O'Donnell.

189
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:45,708
[Rosaleen] Pat's gone over.

190

191
00:13:49,375 --> 00:13:51,250
Have you no blessings of your own?

192
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:52,750
No.

193
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:57,875
Widowed.

194
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,041
We were married for less than a year.

195
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,833
[whispering] I adore thee,
O most precious cross,

196

adorned by the tender, delicate,
and venerable members of Jesus my Savior,

sprinkled and stained
with his precious blood.

198
00:14:23,333 --> 00:14:24,250
Amen.

Well?

203
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:06,291
I've been summoned all the way here…

204
00:15:06,375 --> 00:15:09,250
-Sure, no one forced you. Another?
-[man] Aye, two more.

205
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:12,833
-To offer my professional opinion--
-You can give me your professional--

My professional opinion

207

on a girl who could be somehow having food
secretly shoveled into her mouth.

208
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:20,875
Well, that sounds about right.

209
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,500
What kind of backwards village
imports a professional nurse

210
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,208
for something like this?

211
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:32,333
"Backwards village."
Didn't you nurse in the Crimea?

212
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,625
That's exactly my point, Mr. Ryan.
This has nothing to do with nursing.

213
00:15:35,708 --> 00:15:38,791
You're being paid handsomely
to sit on your backside for a fortnight.

214
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,708
-[man] I'll pay you to sit on my back--
-I'm warning you!

215

[hushed] Prove it's nonsense, then.

Prove it's nonsense, then fuck off home.

afterwards.

235

I misunderstood.

I thought your son had emigrated.

St. Cecilia.

She's the patron of music.

Or Eliza?

Or maybe Betty?

She is not taking visitors.

313
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:33,000
And who gives him his?

314

No, missus,
not just water and wheat. [sighs]

-I dig up turf, and you dig up the truth.

That's exactly right.

341

You see, you also need your stories.

342
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:28,666
You write them down
in that little notebook of yours.

-Good night, Kitty.

Will you be able to sleep
with the light on, Anna?

I'm gonna have to do the same for you.

Hannah, perhaps?

385

But then I'd be someone else,

I know your mother misses him terribly.

Yes. Turn around. Sit down, please.

What was it like?

432
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:34,041
It was difficult.

720
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,750
We'll eat in a little while.

721
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:16,750
If she wants something to eat,
she may have it.

722
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,375
There's soup on the side.

723
00:56:20,916 --> 00:56:22,833
[Lib] Soup would be lovely. Thank you.

724
00:56:31,041 --> 00:56:32,791
-It's not hot.
-That's fine.

725
00:56:34,041 --> 00:56:35,125
Thank you, Kitty.

[Rosaleen breathing agitatedly]

727
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:53,708
Mrs. Lib?

728
00:56:55,166 --> 00:56:56,875
Open your mouth, please, Anna.

729
00:57:00,833 --> 00:57:03,125
-If you won't eat, I have to use force.
-[Anna gasps]

730
00:57:03,208 --> 00:57:05,541
-Mrs. Lib, no. No, please.
-Open your mouth.

731
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:08,416
-[sobs] Please, please, please.
-Open your mouth. It will hurt otherwise.

732
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,708
-Open your mouth, Anna.
-No. No. No, no.

733
00:57:10,791 --> 00:57:12,583
Anna, please. Anna, down!

734
00:57:12,666 --> 00:57:16,083
-[Anna breathing agitatedly]
-[Lib] Open. Open.

735
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:18,125
[hushed] Anna, open!

736
00:57:19,416 --> 00:57:20,333
[softly] Open.

[Anna gagging]

738
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:35,000

-[Lib breathing shakily]
-[Anna gagging]

740
00:57:42,541 --> 00:57:44,875

[crying]

742
00:57:47,833 --> 00:57:48,958
[softly] Forgive me.

-[sobbing]
-[Lib breathing heavily]

746
00:57:54,875 --> 00:57:56,041
[Rosaleen] Anna?

747
00:57:56,125 --> 00:57:58,583
-[Anna whimpers softly]
-[Rosaleen] Is everything all right?

748
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:02,000
[Lib breathing heavily]

749
00:58:03,375 --> 00:58:04,666
Everything's fine.

750
00:58:08,458 --> 00:58:09,666

Are you all right?

755
00:58:19,833 --> 00:58:20,833
[mutters faintly]

756
00:58:22,291 --> 00:58:24,166
-I think we should go back.
-No.

757
00:58:26,041 --> 00:58:28,750
-I want to show you something.
-Another time, Anna. Come on.

758
00:58:28,833 --> 00:58:29,875
Not you.

759
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:35,291
You.

760
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,583
[Lib] Be ca-- Be careful, Anna.

761
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,041
[Anna pants softly]

762
00:58:49,750 --> 00:58:51,666
-[Will] The Holy Well.
-[Anna grunts softly]

763
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:55,166
We used to come here when we were…

764
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,666
"Turn the pebbles in the…"

765
00:59:01,416 --> 00:59:02,250
"Bullaun."

[Will] Bullaun.

767
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:10,958
"Rub a clootie on what hurts,
and tie it to the May tree."

768
00:59:13,458 --> 00:59:14,625
[Anna, softly] Yes.

769
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:17,916
"By the time it rots away,

770
00:59:19,208 --> 00:59:20,791
your hurt will be gone."

771
00:59:22,291 --> 00:59:23,250
[Will] Hmm.

772
00:59:26,666 --> 00:59:28,458
[softly] I've submitted my article.

773

"Murder by Degrees."

774
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:33,500
You have to try
with the other committee men.

775
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:36,583
-[whispers] She's going to die.
-Stop it.

776
00:59:42,333 --> 00:59:43,291
Anna?

777
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:47,875
Anna?

778
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:52,208
Anna, I'm here. I'm here.

[Will sighs]

781
00:59:59,666 --> 01:00:03,333
Give her to me. Give her to me.
You can't take her in. Come on, Anna.

782
01:00:03,416 --> 01:00:05,250
-This has to end, Lib.
-Come on.

[anxious ambient music plays]

784
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:12,375
[Kitty] Anna?!

785
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:23,833
[Lib] Here she is.
Here she is. Here she is.

786
01:00:27,708 --> 01:00:29,541
[weakly] It's just a faint, Mammy.

787
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,875
-Is there…
-[Anna wheezes faintly]

788
01:00:33,958 --> 01:00:37,625
-[soft labored breathing]
-Is there anything I can get you?

789
01:00:41,916 --> 01:00:42,958
Nothin'?

790
01:00:45,666 --> 01:00:47,916
Nothin' at all, Anna?

791
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,166
[breath quivers]

792
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,666
[softly] Just a little sleep, Mammy.

793
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:58,250
And then, I'll awake.

794
01:00:58,333 --> 01:01:00,416
[breathing faintly]

795
01:01:01,500 --> 01:01:02,833
Then you'll wake.

-Best teacher I could have.
-[Lib] Why is she in that chair?

Dr. McBrearty brought it.

808

Borrowed it from Sir Otway.

809
01:02:03,458 --> 01:02:05,458
Just till Anna's back on her feet.

Lean forward, please, Anna.

I don't, but…

[breathing heavily]

849
01:06:04,708 --> 01:06:06,500
I do understand

850
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:09,000
that your mother spat chewed-up food…

851
01:06:09,083 --> 01:06:10,291
Manna from Heaven.

852
01:06:10,375 --> 01:06:12,291
-[Lib] …from her mouth…
-From God.

853
01:06:12,375 --> 01:06:14,625
-[Lib] …in order to sustain you.
-Manna.

854
01:06:15,833 --> 01:06:17,833
Food, Anna.

855
01:06:17,916 --> 01:06:18,875
Food.

856
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,708
'Twas a holy secret.

01:06:26,791 --> 01:06:28,041

[Lib] Anna…

859

Anna, I have to tell.

I have to.

861
01:06:36,375 --> 01:06:38,916
It's what I'm here for,
to find out the truth.

862
01:06:41,208 --> 01:06:42,416
Then eat.

863
01:06:46,291 --> 01:06:48,875
[breathing agitatedly]

864
01:06:50,666 --> 01:06:52,583
What if your mother could kiss you again?

865
01:06:53,666 --> 01:06:54,666
What if…

866
01:06:56,541 --> 01:06:57,833
What if God

867
01:06:59,125 --> 01:07:02,208
could provide manna again?

868
01:07:07,166 --> 01:07:08,916
Why won't you eat, Anna?

869
01:07:10,083 --> 01:07:11,291
[softly] I adore thee…

870
01:07:13,458 --> 01:07:15,458
O most precious cross…

871
01:07:16,791 --> 01:07:19,750
adorned by the tender,

872
01:07:20,458 --> 01:07:23,833
delicate, and venerable members…

873
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:28,333
[Lib] Your prayer.

874
01:07:31,958 --> 01:07:33,708
Thirty-three times.

875
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:38,333
[sobs] Whilst fasting.

876
01:07:39,708 --> 01:07:42,000
[Lib] But to what end, Anna? What for?

877
01:07:43,333 --> 01:07:46,250
One soul will be released.

878
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:50,291
Released?

879
01:07:50,875 --> 01:07:52,083
[Anna] From Hell.

880
01:07:56,041 --> 01:07:57,000
Your brother?

881
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:04,625
[quivering] H-- He must be so close now.

882
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:07,208
[sobs]

883
01:08:08,333 --> 01:08:09,333
[Lib] Anna,

884
01:08:09,958 --> 01:08:12,833
fasting means skipping one meal,
not all of them.

885
01:08:15,125 --> 01:08:16,458
That's to atone.

886
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:23,875
[breath quivering]

887
01:08:23,958 --> 01:08:26,583
I have to save him

888
01:08:26,666 --> 01:08:28,875
from all of the burning.

889
01:08:30,708 --> 01:08:31,875
[sobs]

890
01:08:31,958 --> 01:08:34,833
He is burning all the time.

891
01:08:34,916 --> 01:08:37,458
-[Lib] No.
-No, Mrs. Lib.

892
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:40,375
That's what hell is.

893
01:08:40,458 --> 01:08:42,375
-[Lib] No.
-It's ceaseless.

894
01:08:42,458 --> 01:08:45,208
-Anna, he was just a boy.
-[Anna sobbing]

895
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:49,000
He was just a child.
Why would he be burning?

896
01:08:54,166 --> 01:08:55,375
What did he do?

897
01:09:02,541 --> 01:09:04,041
He said it was double.

898
01:09:08,458 --> 01:09:09,458
[Lib] Double?

899
01:09:12,916 --> 01:09:14,166
Double love.

01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,041
A sister…

901
01:09:21,416 --> 01:09:22,583
and a wife.

902
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,000
And I…

903
01:09:28,083 --> 01:09:29,291
[breath quivers]

904
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:39,958
How old were you?

905
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:45,125
[sobs]

906
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:46,208
Nine.

907
01:09:48,583 --> 01:09:50,583
[breath quivering]

908
01:09:53,625 --> 01:09:54,791
Just the once?

909
01:10:02,291 --> 01:10:03,791
[softly] Love is forever.

910
01:10:06,666 --> 01:10:09,000
He told me like it was a story.

911
01:10:11,041 --> 01:10:13,041
We married in the night.

912
01:10:16,208 --> 01:10:18,583
[sobbing softly]

913
01:10:18,666 --> 01:10:20,166
And then he got sick.

914
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,291
[sobs] It--

915
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:26,416
[crying] It wasn't holy.
He was being punished.

916
01:10:30,666 --> 01:10:31,708
And…

917
01:10:31,791 --> 01:10:33,083
[sobs]

918
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:34,625
And Mammy said…

919
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,875
[breath quivering]

920
01:10:37,958 --> 01:10:41,250
-That it was my fault he'd been taken.
-No.

921
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:44,791
-No. That is not true.
-[Anna crying]

922
01:10:46,375 --> 01:10:48,666
-[sniffles]
-That is not true, Anna.

923
01:10:49,583 --> 01:10:50,583
No.

924
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:53,625
[sniffles]

925
01:10:55,041 --> 01:10:56,250
[inhales shakily]

926
01:10:57,333 --> 01:10:58,833
I loved him back.

927
01:11:02,833 --> 01:11:04,166
[sobbing]

928
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:14,333
[tense percussive music plays]

929
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,125
[bell gongs]

930
01:11:21,208 --> 01:11:23,208
[wind gusting]

931
01:11:23,291 --> 01:11:25,291
[tense music continues]

932
01:11:26,875 --> 01:11:28,875
[bell gongs]

933
01:11:34,375 --> 01:11:35,583
[bell gongs]

934
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,666
[tense music continues]

935
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:43,833
[bell gongs]

936
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:51,458
[bell gongs]

937
01:11:56,875 --> 01:11:58,875
[bell gongs]

938
01:12:02,416 --> 01:12:04,250
[tense music swells]

939
01:12:04,333 --> 01:12:06,333
[bell gongs]

940
01:12:12,791 --> 01:12:15,291
[music intensifying, fades out]

941
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:20,458
You have urgent information
pertaining to the watch, Mrs. Wright?

942
01:12:21,416 --> 01:12:22,333
[Lib] I do.

943
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,750
[Dr. McBrearty] Go ahead.

944
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:28,166
Anna O'Donnell is dying.

945
01:12:29,208 --> 01:12:32,375
-[Dr. McBrearty] Mrs. Wright--
-She can barely stand up.

946
01:12:32,458 --> 01:12:33,875
She can barely move.

947
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:37,916
She's feverish,
and her pulse rate quickens by the hour.

948
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:41,250
If you have medical concerns
about the patient,

949
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:45,708
may I ask you come to me,
rather than summoning everybody--

950
01:12:45,791 --> 01:12:48,708
Our watch, sir, has thwarted
the one thing that has kept her alive

951
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:50,041
for the past four months.

952
01:12:52,958 --> 01:12:53,875
Go on.

953
01:13:00,208 --> 01:13:02,208
Anna's mother, Mrs. O'Donnell,

954
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:05,791
has been passing her food
from her own mouth.

955
01:13:07,416 --> 01:13:10,791
She cups her face and kisses her
good morning and good night,

956
01:13:10,875 --> 01:13:13,208
and she feeds her daughter with each kiss.

957
01:13:14,541 --> 01:13:15,625
Like a bird.

958
01:13:17,291 --> 01:13:21,166
Now that you have the answer,
I am begging you, you must stop the watch

959
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:24,125
and make every effort
in keeping this girl from dying.

960
01:13:26,291 --> 01:13:27,291
[Flynn] Lies.

961
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:30,625
I am not lying.

962
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:36,708
It was a mistake,
a terrible mistake, to bring a nurse here.

963
01:13:37,333 --> 01:13:38,625
An English nurse.

964
01:13:38,708 --> 01:13:40,791
What reason would I have to lie?

965
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,250
"Murder by Degrees," Mrs. Wright.

966
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:46,916
Take that up with the journalist.
She did not write that.

967
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:50,333
Well, how else did he catch a glimpse
of the fasting girl?

968
01:13:50,416 --> 01:13:52,875
Perhaps you should interrogate Mr. Byrne
rather than me.

969
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:56,916
Stopped that little girl
from seeing her own mother and father.

970
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:01,333
-But handed her over to some journalist.
-I have only done as you have asked of me.

971
01:14:02,875 --> 01:14:04,083
Sister Michael,

972
01:14:05,250 --> 01:14:08,625
have you observed this practice
between mother and child?

973
01:14:13,708 --> 01:14:14,708
I…

974
01:14:15,750 --> 01:14:17,666
have not, Sir Otway.

975
01:14:17,750 --> 01:14:20,208
-[Flynn] There. Lies!
-I'm not lying.

976
01:14:20,291 --> 01:14:22,708
-[Flynn] She's making it all up.
-I am not lying.

977
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:25,583
-[Flynn] She should not have come here.
-I am telling you the truth.

978
01:14:27,958 --> 01:14:31,416
Perhaps we might ask Anna herself.

979
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:39,083
Very well.

980
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,291
Bring the child in.

981
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:50,333
[Sister Michael] Come through.

982
01:14:50,416 --> 01:14:53,500
[footsteps approaching slowly]

983
01:14:56,250 --> 01:14:58,875
[wheelchair clattering]

984
01:15:12,916 --> 01:15:14,166
There she is.

985
01:15:18,166 --> 01:15:19,125
Anna…

986
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:25,875
Mrs. Wright has shared something with us

987
01:15:25,958 --> 01:15:27,916
that she has observed

988
01:15:29,083 --> 01:15:31,750
between you and your mother.

989
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:38,541
Does your mother feed you, Anna?

990
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:40,791
Pass food…

991
01:15:42,333 --> 01:15:44,041
from her mouth to yours?

992
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:57,166
Let me ask
a little more plainly, if I may.

993
01:15:58,583 --> 01:16:01,333
Have you eaten anything

994
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:04,458
in the past four months, Anna?

995
01:16:14,916 --> 01:16:16,250
Manna from Heaven.

996
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:19,833
That is all.

997
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:21,958
[Flynn] Well done, Anna.

998
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:27,916
[Sir Otway] You will carry on
with the watch as planned, Mrs. Wright.

999
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,750
-[Mr. Ryan] Fools.
-[Sir Otway] The watch will continue.

1000
01:16:30,833 --> 01:16:33,625
[Mr. Ryan] She just told us.
She found the reason.

1001
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:36,041
[Dr. McBrearty]
We all agreed to the watch,

1002
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:38,375
and we shall see it through.

1003
01:16:41,583 --> 01:16:43,500
I will nurse her until she dies.

1004
01:16:46,791 --> 01:16:48,833
As I have done many times before.

1005
01:16:50,916 --> 01:16:52,416
I have nothing more to say.

1006
01:16:56,041 --> 01:16:59,416
I'll be offering a solemn Mass for you
tomorrow night.

1007
01:17:01,083 --> 01:17:03,291
To pray for strength and hope

1008
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:06,208
and for your recovery, Anna.

1009
01:17:06,291 --> 01:17:07,708
Thank you, Father.

1010
01:17:07,791 --> 01:17:11,083
[somber ethereal music plays]

1011
01:17:28,833 --> 01:17:32,041
[ominous music plays]

1012
01:17:38,625 --> 01:17:41,666
[haunting ethereal music plays]

1013
01:17:44,750 --> 01:17:47,125
[breathing heavily]

1014
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:57,333
[breathing heavily]

1015
01:18:02,166 --> 01:18:04,375
[gagging, gasping softly]

1016
01:18:04,458 --> 01:18:06,500
-[softly] Good girl.
-[Anna breathes heavily]

1017
01:18:06,583 --> 01:18:08,166
Good girl. All done.

1018
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,833
-[Anna grunting softly]
-All done.

1019
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:12,750
[shallow labored breathing]

1020
01:18:12,833 --> 01:18:14,375
Lie back. Go on.

1021
01:18:15,125 --> 01:18:16,625
There you go.

1022
01:18:16,708 --> 01:18:18,583
-[whispers] Close your eyes.
-[Anna grunts]

1023
01:18:24,125 --> 01:18:25,375
[softly] She's dying.

1024
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,666
She's chosen.

1025
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:34,750
She's not chosen. She's a child.

1026
01:18:36,083 --> 01:18:37,958
-You don't know us.
-[Lib] Wait.

1027
01:18:44,291 --> 01:18:46,333
I'm sure that's true in many ways.

1028
01:18:49,166 --> 01:18:52,458
And I'm sure there's much about your life
that I don't understand.

1029
01:18:55,791 --> 01:18:57,291
But I do know grief

1030
01:18:58,625 --> 01:18:59,791
and loss.

1031
01:19:02,625 --> 01:19:05,541
And the pain of losing a child
is something I do know.

1032
01:19:09,083 --> 01:19:10,083
[softly] I didn't…

1033
01:19:11,375 --> 01:19:14,750
[voice breaking] Abandoning Anna to die
when you could have prevented it

1034
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:16,333
is a terrible thing.

1035
01:19:22,750 --> 01:19:24,750
[softly] This is for her salvation.

1036
01:19:29,833 --> 01:19:32,083
[whispers] Perhaps you could
kiss her good night again?

1037
01:19:33,250 --> 01:19:36,041
-[Rosaleen breathes agitatedly]
-Or good morning.

1038
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:40,958
-Or goodbye--
-This life is so short, Mrs. Wright.

1039
01:19:44,625 --> 01:19:46,125
The next is for eternity.

1040
01:19:49,666 --> 01:19:53,166

[music continues]

1043
01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:46,750
-That's insane.
-Ugh!

1044
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:50,541
-That's insanity, Lib!
-Fine. Don't help. That's fine.

1045
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:54,375
-You can't take a child from its family.
-They don't want her!

1046
01:20:54,458 --> 01:20:57,583
You've fundamentally misunderstood
these people, my people.

1047
01:20:57,666 --> 01:20:58,666
That man loves her.

1048
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:03,666
Love requires some action,
some intervention, at some point.

1049
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:07,916
-Not just standing by--
-His faith, his prayer, is his action.

1050
01:21:08,666 --> 01:21:11,208
-You don't understand--
-Perhaps. Yes, perhaps.

1051
01:21:11,291 --> 01:21:14,500
But this isn't some philosophical point
that we can debate.

1052
01:21:15,666 --> 01:21:18,500
This is a child's life,
and they are killing her.

1053
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:22,750
You wrote so yourself.
Or were you just lying?

1054
01:21:22,833 --> 01:21:24,875
-Her mother and father--
-Have failed her.

1055
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:27,125
-[Will] That's not--
-Will you help me?

1056
01:21:28,166 --> 01:21:31,125
The family will be at Mass this evening.
This is my last chance to help her.

1057
01:21:31,208 --> 01:21:32,958
To do something good here. Please.

1058
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:36,625
The sun sets at nine.
Will you come then to the well?

1059
01:21:36,708 --> 01:21:37,666
[Will sighs]

1060
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:39,625
[scoffs]

1061
01:21:39,708 --> 01:21:41,041
[breathes deeply]

1062
01:21:41,125 --> 01:21:43,500
This could be something new
for each of us.

1063
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:47,166
A new story. A new life.

1064
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:48,458
I don't want that.

1065
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:51,500
I'm not asking you
to fall in love with me.

1066
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:54,083
I'm asking you to help and maybe…

1067
01:21:56,416 --> 01:21:59,708
maybe live a different way
and find contentment in a different place.

1068
01:21:59,791 --> 01:22:00,791
No.

1069
01:22:07,875 --> 01:22:09,000
[inhales]

1070
01:22:10,916 --> 01:22:12,458
If you don't want to come…

1071
01:22:16,875 --> 01:22:18,041
I'd love you--

1072
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:20,333
I want you to come.

1073
01:22:22,541 --> 01:22:25,250
But if you don't want to,
can you just get us as far as Dublin?

1074

you're asking of me.

It's kidnapping, Lib. We'd end up in jail.

was a pile of ash.

[Mr. Ryan] Oh,
stop with your nonsense, Flynn.

If there was a body to be cut open,

would you have found there.

-Nothing has been proven, Flynn.

1187

That is true.

1188
01:34:04,833 --> 01:34:09,291
Because this woman has destroyed
any evidence of a miracle

1189
01:34:09,375 --> 01:34:10,958
by burning down the house.

1190
01:34:11,041 --> 01:34:14,041
-[Mr. Ryan] Jesus Christ.
-[Sir Otway] Is that an accusation?

1191
01:34:14,125 --> 01:34:15,875
[Flynn] Of course it's an accusation.

1192
01:34:15,958 --> 01:34:18,541
-This is a matter for the police.
-[Father Thaddeus] Enough.

1193

The most pressing question,

1194
01:34:24,375 --> 01:34:26,250
a-- as I see it,

1195
01:34:26,333 --> 01:34:32,458
is how much liability
could be attached to a nurse

1196
01:34:32,541 --> 01:34:35,500
acting in the capacity of a servant

1197
01:34:36,708 --> 01:34:38,041
to this committee?

1198
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:49,791
You will remain here

1199
01:34:50,541 --> 01:34:54,125
until the head constable says you may go.

1200
01:34:55,041 --> 01:34:57,166
And it goes without saying

1201
01:34:57,833 --> 01:35:00,708
that you won't receive your payment.

1202
01:35:24,166 --> 01:35:25,666
[Sister Michael] Does it hurt?

1203
01:35:27,791 --> 01:35:28,833
[Lib] Mm.

1204
01:35:31,375 --> 01:35:32,375
Awful.

1205
01:35:33,916 --> 01:35:36,166
That they allowed it to go on for so long.

1206
01:35:37,083 --> 01:35:38,875
That a little girl should die.

Can I ask you something?

1212
01:36:10,416 --> 01:36:11,375
Mm-hmm.

1213
01:36:12,458 --> 01:36:14,375
Before I found you last night…

1214
01:36:17,916 --> 01:36:19,875
I believe I was granted…

a vision.

1216
01:36:25,625 --> 01:36:29,250
I was too uneasy
to stay to the end of Mass, you see.

1217
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,500
And on my way to the house,

1218
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:37,083
I saw…
