00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
I like men. 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.000
It's the truth that I've been hiding all along.

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.000
Our worker, Dong, knew this secret.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.000
So I had to kill him to cover this up. 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.000
Not true, Tian. Why are you lying?

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Tian. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.000
Look at me. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Your mom was the one who did this to me. 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.000
You and your family needs to pay.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000
Chan, are you okay?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.000
Madam, Mr. Tian and Mr. Song haven't followed us yet. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.000
Yang, take your mother and get out of here. 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.000
I will help them out.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.000
You are poisoned by beetle orchid. 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.000
If you don't get the antidote, you'll die.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.000
This is the antidote.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.000
Catch her. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Jiu. 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.000
Jiu. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000
You're still alive. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.000
Take Mother and Aunt Jia out of here. 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.000
But…

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.000
Please take care of Mother and Aunt Jia for me. 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.000
I'll come back to help you.

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.000
Madam, let's go. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.000
Sir. 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.000
Go. Li. Hurry!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Sir. / Hurry, Madam. 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.000
Take Madam Li. / Let's go. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.000
Don't worry. He doesn't dare to hurt me. Go!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Why didn't Madam Li come after us yet?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Right. 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I'll take you two to find a place to hide first

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and will find a way back to help the rest. Let's go. 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.000
Okay. / Let's go.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.000
Wait.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Madam. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Madam. 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Jiu. 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Don't say anything yet. The Japanese soldiers are following us. 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.000
Let's hurry and get out of here.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Follow me.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Father, please hang in there.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Sir, please call the doctor for Father.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Do you think that I'm that kind?

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.000
Huh?

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Tian, don't beg from someone like him.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
If you don't want to die, give me the antidote.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
W don't have one. 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000
If you want it, 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000
you'll have to wait for Madam Li and Jia to contact you.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And don't even think about harming us.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Otherwise, you will not get the antidote

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.000
and will die as well.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Do you threaten me?

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.000
Father, no. 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Shut up. 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Lock them up.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Sir. 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Father

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Are you okay?

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.000
How are you doing, Madam?

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.000
Hang in there. 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Jia. 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.000
Hurry up, Madam.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
The more he moves, the closer he is to death.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The poison of orchid will slowly get into the blood

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
and suck his blood. 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000
The one who is exposed to it will begin to suffocate.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Eventually he coughs up blood and dies. 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Jiu. 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Why do you bring me here?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000
To see the doctor.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Doctor Qi.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000
You're not dead yet. 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000
What happened?

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Why are you still…

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Alive?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.000
And you stay here with Jiu?

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.000
I have saved him from the poison of the beetle orchid. 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Before I returned to the Song Family, 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
I had successfully prepared an antidote against the poison of beetle orchid. 

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.000
I brought it back with me. 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
So I could survive

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000
from the poison of beetle orchid you used to attack me.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Thank heavens for that. 

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Mom. 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Take the injured to the basement of the house quickly. 

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:56.000
Let's g. Go. 

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.000
Mom, hang in there. 

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Jia. 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Jia. 

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:06.000
Jia. 

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Jia. 

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.000
Jia. 

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Jia. 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Hey, you also got the poison of beetle orchid?

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:23.000
Jia. 

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000
Jia. 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Is Fu also with Lady Pin now?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Thank you very much for saving my brother. 

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.000
I'll find a way to let Pin know

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.000
that you are still alive.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.000
Mei and Fu must be happy.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Besides, 

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Pin may find a way to investigate the situation for us.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.000
So we can get in to help Father and Tian.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Don't worry about Tian. 

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000
I have to help him out anyway. 

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000
He is valuable and very important to me.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
I don't want to lose him again.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
We went to find firewood to boil the herbal soup for Jia.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Madam, let me do it.

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.000
It's okay, I can't just stand still.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Let's help each other.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.000
If we hurry up and give Jia and Chan treatment, 

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000
we can go back to help Mr. Song and Tian soon. 

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000
This mess…

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
It happened because of me. 

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Bua. 

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.000
You know that Tian didn't do it, right?

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Tian wasn't a murderer. 

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.000
I know that, Madam. 

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000
I have raised Mr. Tian since he was a child.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
I was the one who did it. 

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000
I didn't think the situation would get out of hand like this. 

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I just want to hide

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
that Tian is a homosexual.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Madam. 

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000
Mr. Tian is a homosexual.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000
He can't change no matter what. 

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Even if you kills someone or tries to find a solution, 

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
he is still a homosexual.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000
I know

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
that I can't change him. 

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000
But he is my son.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Whether he's gay or becomes a commoner, I still love him.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000
But others…

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Other people don't love my son like I do.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000
I'm afraid that

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:52.000
Others would use this to harm Tian if they know about it.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
I'm just a mother who wants to protect the child.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Madam.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I understand your feeling. 

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
A mother has to do everything

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000
to protect her own child.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000
But from what happened today,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Mr. Tian bravely pleaded guilty on behalf of you

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
and didn't run away from problems.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000
You must have seen it, right?

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Mr. Tian is much stronger than we thought.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Madam.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
I beg you, Madam. 

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
If this ends and we survive, 

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:59.000
I would like to ask you to give him a chance.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Let him live his life as he wants.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
Madam.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Mr. Tian has grown up so much.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000
You don't have anything to worry now.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Jia.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Jia.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000
You know it right? You were directly exposed to the poison through your wound.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000
And now,

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
its poison penetrated and dispersed

00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.000
in your body so fast that…

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000
my resurrection powder can't resist it.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
I'm your best student. 

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000
I know since I got poisoned

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000
that I won't survive.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Doctor. 

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000
It's great

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000
that you're still alive. 

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Don't say anything now, Jia.

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.000
The more you talk, the more tired you become.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Before I die, 

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
I can see you alive.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
This is a merit of my life. 

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000
I feel guilty for a long time.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.000
I thought l was ungrateful 

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000
that I took part in killing my benefactor.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000
From now on, 

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.000
I can be at ease. 

00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.000
At least…

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000
At least the hell that I'm heading to

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000
will not punish me too harsh. 

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:12.000
Forget about that. 

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Stay strong.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Jia! Hold up. 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Jia.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Jia.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Jia! Jia!

00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:26.000
Jia!

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Jia!

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Jia.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Jia! Hang in there. 

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:39.000
Jia! Hang in there. 

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:40.000
Jia.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.000
Jia!

00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.000
Jia!

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Doctor. 

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.000
She can't be saved?

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Madam.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Jia.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Jia.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000
Jia.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Madam.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.000
This is my time. 

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Jia.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Please be safe. 

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Madam.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
I've committed too many sins

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
If I am not here anymore, 

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
please take good care of yourself, Madam. 

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000
I promise.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.000
I will take good care of myself.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Jia.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Please apologize to Mr. Tian for me. 

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
I'm sorry

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000
that he had to plead on my behalf.

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:18.000
I'm sorry.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
You have to help Mr. Tian.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Madam, go. Go.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Jia.

00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:32.000
Jia.

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Jia, Jia. 

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Jia, Jia. 

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Jia.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Jia.

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:45.000
Jia.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Jia.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Jia.

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:53.000
Jia, Jia. 

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Jia.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Doctor. 

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Have you found an antidote?

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:40.000
There are only strange medicines. 

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.000
We should let the owner check them, Sir.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:07.000
That's too much, bastard. 

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Bao, no!

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Let go. 

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:13.000
Take him to isolation.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Bao. 

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000
Let go of me. 

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Where is the antidote?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
I asked where the antidote is.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Bastard. 

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.000
Even if I have one, I won't give it to you.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000
You killed our brother. 

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Your place is hell.

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:47.000
Killing brother?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
If I killed Chun, 

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000
you also killed Zhang.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000
You are more cruel than me. 

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Killing Zhang with your words

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.000
until he had to slit his throat.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Then the karma came after your sone instead. 

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
He becomes a homosexual like Zhang.

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000
So what did someone with vicious mind like you

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
do to end up like this?

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Bastard, you homosexual. 

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.000
You pansy. 

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:23.000
No, No. 

00:21:23.300 --> 00:21:24.000
No! 

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.000
No! Ma!

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.000
Ma, stop!

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000
You can insult me anyway you like. 

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
We are judged by our behavior after all. 

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
No matter what gender you are, 

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
but if your behavior is like this,

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000
it is even lower than a beast.

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000
You poof. 

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:53.000
No! 

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Ma, stop!

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Even if you kill us, 

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.000
I don't have an antidote for you. 

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:03.000
I'm not going to kill you guys.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000
I will keep you

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000
in exchange for Li's antidote.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Once I get the antidote, 

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:13.000
you'll die. 

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Remember it. 

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.000
Father.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Madam, how are you?

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.000
Are you hurt?

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Bua.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.000
Yes. 

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Let me hep.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Slowly.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Wait. 

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Thanks a lot. 

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.000
Yes. 

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Let her drink this.

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:36.000
I'm not drinking this. 

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:38.000
I don't know if it's poison.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Then throw it away. 

00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:42.000
Calm down, Madam. Madam Chan.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
How can I calm down?

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.000
You also saw

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:47.000
that Madam has poison.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000
All that happened

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000
is because Madam Li used poison to kill people.

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:54.000
The whole thing happened because of me?

00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:56.000
And who told everything to Mr. Ma?

00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Letting enemies into our house, seeking for chance to attack our family. 

00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:01.000
But I've never killed anyone.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
I just want my Yang to become the head of the Five Dragons Association. 

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.000
I did it to protect my son as well.

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.000
You can't just blame me.

00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:12.000
Don't say this. 

00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:13.000
Please top. 

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Madam Li, Madam Chan. 

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.000
You two claim to do it for your children.

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:21.000
But have you ever asked them if they want it?

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.000
If their mothers had to hurt others for themselves like this?

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
The Five Dragons Association has now collapsed.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000
I think we shouldn't have an argument. 

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
We should discuss with each other. 

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.000
What should we do?

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000
How can we help Mr. Song and Mr. Tian? 

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000
The association no longer exists.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
The fortune, ranking, and power that I used to fight for.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000
It means nothing now. 

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000
But at least.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Yang is still here with you.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
But my son Tian,

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000
I don't know if he's still alive.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Jiu. 

00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:46.000
Mei, Fu.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.000
How did you get here?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000
Pin and Yang brought us here.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Her congenital disease makes her weak.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
She was also poisoned by opium for a long time

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
until her body can't handle it. 

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.000
So that means my sister…

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:38.000
We can still give her treatment.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Doctor Qi will treat you. 

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.000
You'll be better now. 

00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000
But we can't leave her like this long.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.000
It's really hard to find the herbs used for the treatment.

00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:00.000
But I know someone who can find it.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
I need to travel to get the herbs by myself right now.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Thank you so much, Doctor. 

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Pin overheard the market vendors saying that

00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:22.000
only a few workers managed to escape.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:26.000
The rest are locked up in the house with Father, Tian and Bao.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000
But no one dared to inform the authorities

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
because the Japanese soldiers get involved in this. 

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Oh, how is Mr. Song doing now?

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000
But Mr. Ma was poisoned by the beetle orchid.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
He must be waiting for the antidote from me. 

00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.000
He wouldn't dare hurting them. 

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000
And do you really have an antidote?

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000
No.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000
At that time, Jia lied to make Mr. Ma

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:58.000
release Tian and Mr. Song.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Then we can't use the same trick again.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Because if he finds out, 

00:28:04.300 --> 00:28:06.000
he will kill us for sure. 

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Don't worry about the antidote.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
I'm preparing it.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Is this the resurrection powder that can be used as an antidote against the beetle orchid?

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000
Right. 

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000
The beetle orchid is a poisonous mushroom produced in the human body. 

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000
It slowly sucks the blood of those poisoned to death.

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:44.000
To detoxify it, 

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
we must use the herb that heats the blood

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000
until the orchid dust can't grow

00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000
and finally dies. 

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000
We need nine special herbs

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000
with fire element. 

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Simmer it until thickened.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Wait for it to precipitate

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
and become crystallized and turn into powder. 

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
But the longer we wait, 

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
the more Mr. Ma will suffer. 

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
And he might hurt Mr. Song and everyone.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
How long will it take to finish, Doctor?

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Three more days.

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000
But I can't stay and watch until it is finished.

00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:38.000
Because I need to retrieve the herbs to make medicine for Jiu's sister.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Madam Li, 

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Madam Chan, 

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.000
Bua, 

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
help get Mr. Song out.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Congratulations, Ma. 

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Finally, you become the leader of the Five Dragons Association as you wish. 

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
You got such a sweet mouth.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Are you afraid of dying like Chun?

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Oh, brother. 

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
You have proven yourself

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
that you are eligible to be a leader.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Why would I stop you?

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Besides, I am a woman.

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:38.000
How can I fight against you?

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Listen carefully.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000
I can control even Big Brother.

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:51.000
So don't act like a snake that secretly bites me. 

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Or I won't let you live. 

00:30:57.000 --> 00:30:59.000
All the businesses of Song and Chun families, 

00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:02.000
I'll take care of everything myself, 

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
including your teahouse too. 

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Big Brother is weird.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Letting a woman like you take care of the business for a long time.

00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.000
From now on, 

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:18.000
you just sit and relax. 

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:21.000
Wait for the order from me.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Thank you Ma

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
for sharing my burden. 

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Sir. 

00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Someone attaches this note on the front door.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Three more days, 

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000
I will bring you the antidote

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000
in exchange for Mr. Song, Tian and Bao.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Don't harm everyone.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Three more days, 

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Li will exchange the antidote for the hostages.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:04.000
You gather all our force, 

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000
including the soldiers lent by Captain Hiroshi.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.000
I will surround and ambush Li.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Prepare oil and gunpowder.

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.000
I will burn this place down.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000
You wait and see the end of those who dared to be enemies against me. 

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Father.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Are you feeling better?

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:52.000
It's all gone. 

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Five Dragons Association.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
It is ruined. 

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000
I'm sorry.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:19.000
I'm sorry, Father.
Come here quickly. Hurry up.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Next time, you have to be careful when you walk and run.

00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000
So that you don't hurt yourself like this again.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:57.000
If it hurts, just cry.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.000
I don't dare to cry. I'm afraid you will scold me. 

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
If you dare to say this out, then you're not really afraid of me.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Madam Li won't scold you. 

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:11.000
She is Tian's mother. She must be kind like him. 

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Do you know Tian too?

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000
When he was with you, how was he like?

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Tian is kind. He likes to tell stories to me. 

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Take me to buy delicious snacks.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.000
When I was sick, he also feed me medicine.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Yes, Tian once told us that

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.000
if Mei was happy, then Fu would be happy, 

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.000
and Jiu and Tian would be happy as well.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000
You are afraid of losing power

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
and lose your leadership because of a son like me. 

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000
Mother. 

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000
I just want to live happily.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
You'll never be happy

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000
as long as you are like this. 

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000
When he was with me, 

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:22.000
there are only sorrow, 

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
fear and paranoia for him. 

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Perhaps

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:38.000
it might be me that made him unhappy.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.000
These are blankets for everyone.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
And this is food. 

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
I brought a lot. I'm afraid everyone will be hungry. 

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Thanks.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.000
The antidote will be completed soon. 

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
We will take this medicine to help Father and Tian.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
This job is very dangerous.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000
If anything happens to me, 

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
You...

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:38.000
I'll find new boyfriend for sure. 

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.000
What?

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000
So you can't die. 

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Help Mr. Song and Tian and come back to me. 

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000
I have talked to my father already. 

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Although we don't have a lot of money now, 

00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:58.000
but we know someone who can help you escape from Mr. Ma.

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Thank you for being by my side.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
When I was in trouble, 

00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000
you also stay here by my side. 

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:19.000
If we don't help each other during a hard time, when will we do it?

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:24.000
But my family almost has nothing left.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
If I come back alive,

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000
are you really going to marry a poor guy like me?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000
My family is poor as well.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000
The first time we met, I still had to sell fake vase.

00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.000
So I think the two of us are well suited to each other.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Just live a poor life together. 

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000
What?

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
You let me hide at Lady Pin's palace?

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Yes, you're not feeling well yet. 

00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.000
I'll bring the antidote to exchange for the hostages myself. 

00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:34.000
No, I'll go with you too. 

00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:35.000
Mom. 

00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.000
Why are you going?

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.000
You'll be a burden to others.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000
I won't let you save Mr. Song and take credit alone.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Madam, please be rational.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Do you want to know my reason?

00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.000
Fine. 

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Among us, 

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
I am the closest with Mr. Ma. 

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
I know how to persuade him. 

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:02.000
If I go, 

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
there'll be more chance to help Mr. Song and Tian. 

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Are you going to help Tian?

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:21.000
Right. 

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Well, Madam Li saved you and me once.

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.000
I don't want to be indebted.

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.000
So we won't have to meet again in the next life.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Besides, 

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
the Five Dragons Association no longer existed.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
I have no reason to let Tian die.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000
If you're going, 

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000
don't be a burden to others.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
The medicine will finish soon. 

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000
We can help Tian and Mr. Song.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.000
I'll be right back, Captain.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:41:58.000
I have investigated, Madam. 

00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:01.000
The Japanese don't fully support Mr. Ma.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:03.000
They just wanted to use him.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.000
If they are in trouble, 

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.000
they'll definitely kick Mr. Ma out.

00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Are you sure?

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:15.000
The captain also told me that the Japanese soldiers are at odds with each other.

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:18.000
If the other party caught that the captain is messing with Thais, 

00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:20.000
they won't let him go.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Press it. 

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Tian's handkerchief.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Jiu, take it easy.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
I'm confident that we will be able to help Mr. Song and Tian out.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
You'll surely meet Tian again.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
You don't see that the love between me and Tian…

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000
is disgusting?

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000
It's not my duty to judge

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
what kind of love is disgusting, or not disgusting.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.000
You too. 

00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Don't let anyone judge you. 

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Don't tie your own happiness to other people's thoughts.

00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000
You know what?

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:02.000
I have raised Tian since he was little.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000
He is kind, 

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:07.000
and humble. 

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:14.000
He always cares about the feelings of those around him to make them happy.

00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:18.000
No matter how miserable he was, he never complained.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000
I'm glad that

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000
now, 

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000
you've become his happiness.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Madam. 

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Herbal tonic

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000
to restore your strength to fight with Mr. Ma's gang. 

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Thank you, Madam. 

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Jiu. 

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Drink it.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Madam Li has carefully boiled it for you. 

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Tian. 

00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Tian. 

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Tian. 

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Jiu. 

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.000
How did get here?

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Tian, I'm coming to check the area so I can find a way to help you.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Doctor Qi is cooking the antidote now.

00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:02.000
We'll take that medicine to save you and Mr. Song. 

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:06.000
How are Mother and everyone?

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Everyone is safe.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Except...

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Jia. 

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Jia?

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:29.000
And how are you, Tian?

00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:36.000
Did they hurt you this much?

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Hang in there.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:40.000
I'll come back to help you.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
We'll leave all the chaos behind

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
and live the life I promised you.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.000
I'm fine, Jiu,

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
but you have to help my father.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:53.000
He's seriously ill.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
He's suffering 

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
because he's disappointed in me. 

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000
I don't want anything to happen to him. 

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.000
please help my father.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Please. 

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Don't worry.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000
You and your father must be safe.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.000
I promise with my life.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Jiu. 

00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.000
Get out now. They'll see you.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Be careful.

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.000
I'll be right back to save you. 

00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000
How was it? Have you met Father and Tian?

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000
How are they?

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Are Tian and Father injured?

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Both of them are safe.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Jia. 

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Tomorrow, I'm going to help Mr. Song and Tian. 

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000
May your soul

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000
bless us to succeed.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:36.000
If I survive, 

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
I'll come back to arrange a grand funeral for you.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Chan and I will negotiate with Mr. Ma, 

00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:54.000
which he probably won't give up easily.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
But I will try to buy the time as long as possible.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Jiu said that Mr. Song and Tian are locked up in the wood shed at the back of the house.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
There's a small exit blocked by the trees in that area. 

00:51:07.700 --> 00:51:09.000
Mr. Ma probably didn't know about it. 

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
You and Jiu go in to help Mr. Song and Tian out and go through that way.

00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:15.100
As for Pin, 

00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.000
and Bua, 

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:18.000
wait outside.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000
When the two are rescued, 

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.000
everyone gets in Pin's car and flee as quickly as possible.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.000
And what about you and Madam Li?

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:29.000
I still have beetle orchid left.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000
I'll use it to deal with Mr. Ma and quickly escape.

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Madam. 

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:37.000
What if it doesn't succeed?

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Just talk about later. 

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
It's settled then.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:50.000
I'm afraid that Ma is also preparing a plan to welcome you, Madam. 

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:05.000
How did you get here?

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.000
And how do you know that we are here?

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Didn't Jiu spy at Song family's house this morning?

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Mud is my staff.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.000
But it will be too long to tell the story now.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000
Let's get to the point.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
You can't go back to your home now.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Why do we have to believe you?

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.000
From the beginning, 

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:32.000
you must have sent Mud to investigate the news, right?

00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:34.000
How much did you sell the news from Song family?

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
The leaked information from the house, 

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
I think it came from you, Chan.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000
I come here today

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.000
because I know that Ma prepares to kill everyone

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000
and burn down Song family's house.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
How can we believe you?

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
How will all of us know that you isn't working with Mr. Ma?

00:52:56.300 --> 00:52:57.000
If I cooperates with him, 

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000
isn't it easier to let them kill you here?

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.000
I know that you guys don't trust me

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.000
and thought that I was a hypocrite.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:19.000
But you know it well, don't you, Li?

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000
In this world, 

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
it's always cruel to women like us.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Especially for the widow whose husband died like me. 

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Staying in the Five Dragons Association

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000
is not easy.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
I am underestimated

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
and also the target to be taken advantage of. 

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Because I'm a single woman, 

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000
I have to struggle in every way possible to maintain my business.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Aren't you afraid

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000
that Mr. Ma will find out that you sided with us?

00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Of course. 

00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:05.000
But I have to do.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Allowing evil guy that killed his own brother like Ma to come to power

00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000
will make all of us suffer in the future.

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
I may not be a good woman, 

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:24.000
But I am not bad enough to support an evil man like Ma. 

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.000
If you don’t want us to go help Mr. Song, 

00:54:28.300 --> 00:54:29.000
what should we do?

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000
About that, 

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000
leave it to me.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Father, Father. 

00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000
Father. 

00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:00.000
Father. 

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Big brother. 

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Big brother. 

00:55:13.300 --> 00:55:14.000
Big brother. 

00:55:17.300 --> 00:55:18.000
Big brother. 

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Big brother. 

00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:24.000
Zhang.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Big Brother, please sit down. 

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Am I really dead?

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Drink it first.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
This must be Meng Po soup

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000
given to the ghost to wipe the memories, right?

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000
What are you talking about?

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000
This is the Keemun tea that you like.

00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Zhang. 

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Since you were gone, 

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:34.000
everything was never the same.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000
The Five Dragons Association had collapsed. 

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Tian is also...

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000
Probably because of your curse.

00:56:48.500 --> 00:56:49.000
Oh my god. 

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Are you saying that

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:55.000
what I said before I died

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:57.000
caused something like this to happen?

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
I never thought that you would kill yourself. 

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000
I did it to protect the association.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
I have never hated you. 

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000
But I don't understand people like you.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
In this world, no one can understand everyone.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Even ourselves,

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000
sometimes we don't even understand ourselves, do we?

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:31.000
And I didn't want anyone to understand me.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.000
I don't even want anyone to pity me

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:41.000
because we only pity those who are struggling

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:43.000
or inferior to us only.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
I don't think that

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
I am inferior to anyone.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000
So what do you want?

00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000
Respect.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Respect me as a human being.

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Not higher

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000
nor lower than others. 

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Just like other people, like an equal. 

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Tian also said this.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.000
As a human being.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:31.000
That's all.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Just this little thing that my son wants, 

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:41.000
but I still can't give him. 

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000
It's a pity that I didn't understand this

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.000
when I was still alive.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:53.000
You likes to talk nonsense.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.000
Why do you keep talking about death?

00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000
If you don't want to watch opera with me, 

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000
just go back.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Father, Father.

00:59:09.300 --> 00:59:10.000
Father. 

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Father. 

00:59:18.300 --> 00:59:19.000
Tian.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Father. 

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Father, please drink some water.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Do you feel better?

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:31.000
I'm sorry.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Why do you apologize to me?

01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000
It's all because of me. 

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Not at all.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
I am the cause of everything. 

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
If I wasn't like this, 

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.000
it wouldn't be a mess.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
And everyone doesn't have to suffer like this. 

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:07.000
No. 

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Because I am narrow-minded.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
I forced Zhang to commit suicide.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Your mother saw the fate of Zhang,

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000
so she didn't want you to end like that.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Don't be angry with her. 

01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Not at all.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
I have never hold a grudge against Mother.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:40.000
I understand.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:43.000
She did it to protect me.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.000
If I…

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
could be the son that you and Mother hoped for, 

01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:01.000
everything wouldn't be like this, right?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Parents gave birth to children, 

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
but not the owner of their lives. 

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:16.000
You have to carry too much of my hope.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
In the past, 

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.000
I had made you

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
feel that being yourself is wrong, 

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
or inferior to others.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
I'm sorry.

01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000
If we can survive, 

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000
from now on,

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:55.000
how you want to live, 

01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:01.000
who you want to love, 

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
what kind of life you want, 

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000
it's up to you, Tian.

01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Choose the live you want to have, 

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
live a happy life.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:27.000
I will respect your decision.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Father. 

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Resurrection powder. 

01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Madam. 

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Everyone is ready.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
How many days have we been locked up?

01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.000
I can't stand it anymore.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Everyone, hang in there. 

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.000
Be patient.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
If Madam Li give the antidote to Mr. Ma, everyone will survive.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000
She won't leave us for sure.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Hey what are you doing?

01:05:53.300 --> 01:05:54.000
What are you doing to us again?

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:59.000
Mr. Ma ordered us to burn and blow up this place today.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Wait. 

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000
What do you mean?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Didn't he say that he will let us go if he gets the medicine?

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Hey, put the buckets down

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000
and bury the dynamite around. Quickly. 

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:15.000
No, you can't. Don’t do it. Put it down. 

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:20.800
Hurry. 

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Thermite.

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000
Be careful.

01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.000
Patrol around. Don't let any single person escape.

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000
You must open it.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000
What's the matter?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Great you're here.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:29.000
I've brought the gift to congratulate you

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:33.000
and the girls to entertain you guys.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
But they wouldn't let me go in.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000
They insisted to let me open the chest.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
My teahouse account

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000
and a list of clients.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:14.000
It contains information that I have obtained

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
for use in business negotiations.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
I have been collecting it for a long time.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:23.000
But today, 

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000
I think it's the time to give it to you. 

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000
As for the liquor, 

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I brought them to celebrate together.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
Ma, would you like some alcohol?

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:11.000
It has been fermented for twenty years.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.000
It's the signature recipe from my teahouse.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
The Japanese soldiers are all at the party.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:28.000
There are only Mr. Ma's subordinates in the house.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.000
You can follow the plan, Madam. 

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:53.000
Yang, be careful.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Be careful.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Stop!

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000
Go!

01:11:13.300 --> 01:11:14.000
What should we do?
