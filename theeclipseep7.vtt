Characters, actions, occupations and events in this series are fictional and created for

00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:17.679
Viewer discretion is advised.

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:22.404
Once you say you care about other people’s feelings,

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:24.884
it means you are disregarding your own.

00:00:25.225 --> 00:00:27.801
If he is doing anything, let me know.

00:00:28.038 --> 00:00:28.965
I’ll deal with him for you.

00:00:28.965 --> 00:00:30.038
I heard that.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.685
I won’t go

00:00:31.985 --> 00:00:33.349
I won’t go until I find it.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.632
I’ll crash here tonight.

00:01:48.156 --> 00:01:49.192
Don’t leave me.

00:01:51.498 --> 00:01:52.462
Uncle!

00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:55.416
Don’t leave me.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.763
What are you standing there for?

00:03:59.146 --> 00:04:00.423
It’s my room.

00:04:01.241 --> 00:04:02.480
I stand anywhere I want.

00:04:05.964 --> 00:04:07.388
What did you do to my jacket?

00:04:08.213 --> 00:04:09.006
What?

00:04:11.681 --> 00:04:12.888
I washed it.

00:04:20.977 --> 00:04:21.793
What are you doing?

00:04:23.822 --> 00:04:25.006
They smell just the same.

00:04:25.006 --> 00:04:26.129
Are you out of your mind?

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:27.853
Of course, they do. They were washed together.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.584
But I like it.

00:04:31.921 --> 00:04:32.898
Your scent.

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.155
You get on my nerves right after waking up.

00:04:38.726 --> 00:04:42.432
Unlike last night when you cried like a puppy in your sleep.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.567
I did.

00:04:48.567 --> 00:04:49.333
Um.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.878
Who did you dream of last night?

00:04:57.175 --> 00:04:57.964
None of your business.

00:05:01.538 --> 00:05:02.183
Akk.

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:05.561
Don’t forget what you told me.

00:05:06.133 --> 00:05:08.686
You will tell everyone what you did.

00:05:15.138 --> 00:05:16.320
I won’t forget it.

00:05:28.193 --> 00:05:29.202
Akk?

00:05:29.663 --> 00:05:30.654
Yes, sir.

00:05:31.053 --> 00:05:33.720
I called to tell Ayan I couldn’t find his assignment.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.484
He said Akk took it.

00:05:36.268 --> 00:05:37.026
Is that so?

00:05:38.537 --> 00:05:41.413
These two usually fight whenever they confront.

00:05:41.892 --> 00:05:45.667
Do you think Akk really took Ayan’s assignment?

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:47.566
That’s pretty unusual.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.000
Yesterday when you were making rounds,

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:51.889
was everything okay?

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.236
Yes, everything was fine.

00:06:02.081 --> 00:06:05.000
Nong, Nian, let’s do it.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.907
Check it again.

00:06:06.102 --> 00:06:08.102
We will take a break in 30 minutes.

00:06:11.264 --> 00:06:12.826
See if it can still be used.

00:06:14.742 --> 00:06:15.608
This damn group.

00:06:16.285 --> 00:06:17.903
When will learn the lesson?

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.432
I didn’t hear you coming, Namo.

00:06:24.647 --> 00:06:26.970
Why aren’t they punished by the Suppalo curse yet?

00:06:32.641 --> 00:06:34.203
Do you want the curse back?

00:06:34.867 --> 00:06:35.798
I do.

00:06:37.043 --> 00:06:38.435
So that they will learn.

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.080
[Chadok: Come see me. Now!]

00:06:50.578 --> 00:06:51.484
I’ve got to go.

00:06:51.588 --> 00:06:52.428
Akk.

00:06:53.547 --> 00:06:54.515
Believe me.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.400
The Suppalo curse will be back.

00:07:14.176 --> 00:07:15.623
Sorry to keep you waiting, sir.

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:25.439
Teacher Sani said you had the new kid’s assignment with you.

00:07:28.183 --> 00:07:28.925
Yes.

00:07:29.663 --> 00:07:30.720
What is it, sir?

00:07:32.095 --> 00:07:33.243
Are you close to him now?

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:37.738
I hope you aren’t brainwashed by Ayan yet.

00:07:41.274 --> 00:07:42.332
No, sir.

00:07:42.793 --> 00:07:43.920
I’m still the same person.

00:07:44.103 --> 00:07:44.932
Very good.

00:07:45.693 --> 00:07:47.602
The prefects’ duty

00:07:47.859 --> 00:07:50.781
is to do whatever it takes to make Suppalo remain Suppalo.

00:07:53.927 --> 00:07:55.000
I hope you don’t forget that.

00:08:22.475 --> 00:08:24.291
When will you tell everyone the truth?

00:08:29.704 --> 00:08:30.844
Can I have a little more time?

00:08:31.704 --> 00:08:32.564
I promise

00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:35.836
I will tell the truth when I’m ready.

00:08:45.834 --> 00:08:46.727
I’ll be waiting.

00:09:18.025 --> 00:09:19.495
[Bruce Wayne: Aren’t you posting anything today?]

00:09:23.525 --> 00:09:25.663
[Thuaphu: No. I don’t know what to post.]

00:09:28.474 --> 00:09:29.736
[Bruce Wayne: Are you doing okay today?]

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:35.674
Thua.

00:09:37.049 --> 00:09:38.031
Can I talk to you?

00:09:39.253 --> 00:09:40.000
Of course.

00:09:40.603 --> 00:09:41.559
I want to take a day off.

00:09:43.311 --> 00:09:44.124
Where are you going?

00:09:45.997 --> 00:09:47.374
What should I tell the teachers?

00:09:47.602 --> 00:09:49.325
That’s okay. I can do that for you.

00:09:49.417 --> 00:09:50.246
You can?

00:09:51.023 --> 00:09:51.916
I can.

00:09:52.659 --> 00:09:53.631
Thanks.

00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.109
What?

00:09:58.620 --> 00:09:59.388
I don’t know.

00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:02.903
Hand off it. Let me see.

00:10:08.244 --> 00:10:09.598
I’ve got hair in your eye.

00:10:19.721 --> 00:10:20.431
Aye.

00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.239
What’s up?

00:10:31.354 --> 00:10:32.870
Do you like Thua or Akk?

00:10:34.208 --> 00:10:35.247
What’s up with you?

00:10:36.208 --> 00:10:37.169
I’m asking you a question.

00:10:39.135 --> 00:10:42.380
If you like Thua, take good care of him.

00:10:44.562 --> 00:10:46.562
He likes to keep things to himself.

00:10:52.234 --> 00:10:53.001
I like…

00:11:01.248 --> 00:11:03.525
I like it when you speak up to me like this.

00:11:07.181 --> 00:11:09.642
But the one you should express your feelings to

00:11:10.663 --> 00:11:11.636
is Thua,

00:11:11.774 --> 00:11:12.663
not me.

00:11:15.287 --> 00:11:16.734
Express what feelings?

00:11:17.559 --> 00:11:18.651
No idea.

00:11:19.227 --> 00:11:20.781
It’s your own feelings.

00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:23.492
If you don’t know, who else does?

00:11:33.413 --> 00:11:35.413
To answer your question,

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:37.872
I don’t like the one you like for sure.

00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.498
You can breathe now.

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.280
Why do they think differently than us?

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.650
We’re rule keepers.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:58.967
We can’t think that way.

00:11:59.080 --> 00:11:59.852
Why?

00:12:00.608 --> 00:12:04.760
You don’t want to call me by the nickname because you’re afraid you’ll be too close to me?

00:12:27.096 --> 00:12:31.623
Protesting is a fundamental human right in a democratic society.
[Students have the right to speak up.]

00:12:31.623 --> 00:12:33.384
You don’t have to agree with us.

00:12:33.384 --> 00:12:36.895
Just respect our right and liberty to express our opinions.

00:12:36.895 --> 00:12:37.783
That’s right.

00:12:37.783 --> 00:12:38.426
Hey!

00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:40.171
Liberty, my ass.

00:12:40.424 --> 00:12:41.828
You guys are outcasts.

00:12:42.074 --> 00:12:44.074
The Suppalo curse will certainly doom you.

00:12:44.463 --> 00:12:46.569
Nun, Nian, are you two scared?

00:12:47.455 --> 00:12:48.923
We’re not scared.

00:12:49.136 --> 00:12:52.179
If you’re not, go protest somewhere else.

00:12:52.179 --> 00:12:53.078
Go!

00:12:54.449 --> 00:12:55.473
Don’t listen to them.

00:12:57.044 --> 00:12:58.020
Keep on protesting.

00:12:58.358 --> 00:12:59.847
The suit is so damn expensive.

00:12:59.848 --> 00:13:01.678
Not even suitable for Thailand’s climate.

00:13:01.678 --> 00:13:02.462
It should be canceled.

00:13:02.462 --> 00:13:03.186
Right.

00:13:03.456 --> 00:13:04.943
I don’t want to wear the Suppalo suit anymore.

00:13:08.067 --> 00:13:09.011
Me neither.

00:13:09.183 --> 00:13:10.239
It’s so hot.

00:13:10.239 --> 00:13:12.017
If you want to wear it, go ahead. But I don’t.

00:13:13.954 --> 00:13:14.829
That’s so true.

00:13:14.829 --> 00:13:16.912
Give us back our freedom.

00:13:16.912 --> 00:13:20.711
Give us back our freedom.

00:13:30.484 --> 00:13:31.783
Quit bothering other people.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.410
Your time is up.

00:13:34.869 --> 00:13:37.124
You can’t just stop us.

00:13:37.303 --> 00:13:39.303
This is our basic right

00:13:39.303 --> 00:13:42.023
according to the National Education Act.

00:13:42.023 --> 00:13:42.919
That’s correct.

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:44.646
A school is a safe place

00:13:44.646 --> 00:13:45.703
that welcomes everyone

00:13:45.703 --> 00:13:49.425
and fosters the culture of advocating basic human rights.

00:13:49.425 --> 00:13:51.710
Students are free to argue their opinions.

00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:54.830
As well as on social media.

00:13:57.163 --> 00:13:58.567
And did you happen to read this statement too?

00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:06.228
Students have the right to engage in particular activities as long as they do not infringe on the rights of others

00:14:06.404 --> 00:14:11.001
or violate school rules which abide by the Ministry of Education.

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:16.990
And now you're infringing on other people's rights to study peacefully.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.054
You're also breaking Suppalo rules.

00:14:20.288 --> 00:14:21.969
Is that right, Teacher Sani?

00:14:23.821 --> 00:14:24.668
That’s right.

00:14:25.051 --> 00:14:27.863
But we want to see a good change in school.

00:14:27.863 --> 00:14:29.470
Back to your class now!

00:14:30.194 --> 00:14:32.960
Student prefects, take all their stuff.

00:14:33.497 --> 00:14:34.390
Do it now!

00:14:44.085 --> 00:14:44.893
I’m sorry.

00:15:01.389 --> 00:15:02.728
Can we really handle it?

00:15:03.263 --> 00:15:03.924
Exactly.

00:15:04.291 --> 00:15:06.185
The protesters are gaining momentum.

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:08.444
More people are taking their side.

00:15:10.111 --> 00:15:12.303
We have to continue our duty.

00:15:14.106 --> 00:15:15.404
To be honest,

00:15:15.905 --> 00:15:18.075
if we disregard their fierceness and demeanors,

00:15:18.742 --> 00:15:20.636
I’m starting to get their point.

00:15:20.636 --> 00:15:21.389
Hey!

00:15:22.485 --> 00:15:23.851
We’re rule keepers.

00:15:24.043 --> 00:15:25.223
We can’t think that way.

00:15:33.144 --> 00:15:34.543
I can’t help but wonder sometimes.

00:15:35.411 --> 00:15:38.263
We are all raised and taught the same way.

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000
But why do they think differently than us?

00:15:41.757 --> 00:15:42.661
No, we aren’t.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:45.737
Think about it carefully.

00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.449
Those who think differently read different books, watch different movies,

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.512
or appreciate different types of art than us.

00:15:54.236 --> 00:15:54.991
Yeah?

00:15:56.993 --> 00:15:58.263
You are what you eat.

00:15:59.412 --> 00:16:00.795
What you take builds who you are.

00:16:18.433 --> 00:16:20.433
1984 by George Orwell.

00:16:21.581 --> 00:16:22.420
It’s a great book.

00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:25.028
Really?

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:27.715
The same author as Animal Farm,

00:16:27.716 --> 00:16:29.716
which was recommended by someone in power in our country.

00:16:30.525 --> 00:16:31.346
Ah!

00:16:31.346 --> 00:16:32.738
I’ve heard about that.

00:16:33.264 --> 00:16:34.689
The same author?

00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:38.401
This Saturday, there will be a forum on 1984.

00:16:38.498 --> 00:16:41.264
The speaker is a new-generation Thai writer.

00:16:43.031 --> 00:16:43.798
Yes.

00:16:52.272 --> 00:16:54.272
[1984 Forum by Prapt]

00:16:59.464 --> 00:17:06.503
1984 is a dystopian novel by a well-known author George Orwell.

00:17:06.503 --> 00:17:08.695
It’s a world’s sensational novel.

00:17:08.695 --> 00:17:10.558
Translated into many languages.

00:17:10.558 --> 00:17:13.919
It has inspired many writers,

00:17:13.919 --> 00:17:16.684
including the guest speaker whom we invited today.

00:17:16.684 --> 00:17:18.565
- Hello, Prapt.
- Hello.

00:17:18.666 --> 00:17:24.306
Can you please tell us a bit about 1984?

00:17:24.306 --> 00:17:24.916
Sure.

00:17:24.916 --> 00:17:37.515
1984 is about a city in the future where the government aims to prohibit citizens from expressing their ideas at all.

00:17:37.515 --> 00:17:39.811
They restrict citizens' freedom to think out of the box.

00:17:39.955 --> 00:17:43.263
If you do something other than what the government demands,

00:17:43.263 --> 00:17:46.672
they will find out and you will be punished.

00:17:46.672 --> 00:17:52.596
Aside from the government, your neighbors are also watching you

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:55.963
to see whether you are breaking any of the government's rules.

00:17:55.963 --> 00:18:00.242
The action is intended to demonstrate their allegiance and loyalty.

00:18:00.242 --> 00:18:03.115
To show that they are not rebellious.

00:18:05.890 --> 00:18:06.740
Where are you going?

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:08.380
Sit here.

00:18:08.903 --> 00:18:10.711
Don’t distract other people.

00:18:11.914 --> 00:18:12.935
Manners.

00:18:12.935 --> 00:18:20.581
As for the government representative, the citizens respect and kiss his ass without knowing what he really looks like.

00:18:20.581 --> 00:18:23.322
He's known as Big Brother.

00:18:28.263 --> 00:18:29.470
Isn’t it romantic?

00:18:31.747 --> 00:18:32.881
What the heck are you talking about?

00:18:34.672 --> 00:18:35.626
How was it?

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.333
Did the book enlighten you at all?

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:41.341
Um.

00:18:45.895 --> 00:18:49.342
Do you think there’s someone in real life who is brainwashed like the main character in the book?

00:18:50.275 --> 00:18:51.056
You.

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:52.722
You, asshole.

00:18:55.408 --> 00:18:59.451
I just knew you’re interested in the book I read.

00:19:00.459 --> 00:19:01.863
Quit being a narcissist.

00:19:02.998 --> 00:19:06.169
The book has been reviewed and it was interesting so I read it.

00:19:06.817 --> 00:19:07.720
Oh, yeah?

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:11.463
Can I see the reviews?

00:19:12.459 --> 00:19:14.903
Why should I show it to you, Ayan?

00:19:17.094 --> 00:19:17.895
Aye.

00:19:18.223 --> 00:19:19.614
My nickname is Aye.

00:19:19.941 --> 00:19:21.856
The whole class calls me Aye.

00:19:22.506 --> 00:19:24.506
You’re the only one calling me by my first name.

00:19:24.948 --> 00:19:25.950
I like it this way.

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:26.777
Why?

00:19:27.364 --> 00:19:28.108
Why?

00:19:28.802 --> 00:19:33.164
You don’t want to call me by the nickname because you’re afraid you’ll be too close to me?

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.606
I’m not afraid.

00:19:37.091 --> 00:19:37.874
Say it then.

00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:38.665
Of course.

00:19:39.031 --> 00:19:39.940
‘Shameless.’

00:19:40.068 --> 00:19:40.861
Happy now?

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:46.440
Are you blushing?

00:19:46.802 --> 00:19:47.772
None of your freaking business.

00:20:08.850 --> 00:20:10.850
He’s here!

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.783
The head of student prefects. My boy!

00:20:15.263 --> 00:20:16.837
Why don’t you wear the uniform?

00:20:16.837 --> 00:20:17.991
You’ll look so good.

00:20:18.741 --> 00:20:19.355
Come on, Mom.

00:20:19.355 --> 00:20:20.486
I’m just coming home.

00:20:20.983 --> 00:20:24.026
Pon, I can’t go anymore.

00:20:25.069 --> 00:20:26.121
My son is home.

00:20:27.653 --> 00:20:29.452
Akk, your nephew.

00:20:30.084 --> 00:20:33.893
I’ll make him wear the uniform and take photos with you.

00:20:34.144 --> 00:20:34.931
Yes.

00:20:34.931 --> 00:20:37.791
Your dad is bragging too much.

00:20:44.518 --> 00:20:45.532
[Ayan: You’re enlightened now. Don’t forget it.]

00:20:45.532 --> 00:20:47.242
[Ayan: Do what you need to do.]

00:21:01.884 --> 00:21:02.712
Mom.

00:21:07.309 --> 00:21:10.354
Why are you out here making such a worrying face?

00:21:12.666 --> 00:21:13.929
Nothing.

00:21:13.929 --> 00:21:14.666
It’s just…

00:21:14.911 --> 00:21:16.104
I’ve been studying a little too hard.

00:21:16.714 --> 00:21:17.521
I see.

00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:19.875
You’ll go to university next year.

00:21:20.511 --> 00:21:21.243
That’s right.

00:21:21.796 --> 00:21:22.660
Keep fighting, Son.

00:21:25.473 --> 00:21:26.282
I’ll fight!

00:21:26.389 --> 00:21:27.154
Great.

00:21:28.751 --> 00:21:30.474
To make our family proud.

00:21:33.264 --> 00:21:35.966
You must be tired, Son.

00:21:39.663 --> 00:21:40.742
A little.

00:21:43.263 --> 00:21:45.653
If you’re too tired, let it go sometimes.

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:50.955
Mom.

00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:55.547
Can I sleep on your lap?

00:21:56.387 --> 00:21:57.719
You’re a big boy now.

00:21:58.081 --> 00:21:59.792
Still want to sleep on Mommy’s lap?

00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:27.181
Wat, Kan,

00:22:27.905 --> 00:22:28.863
how did he get here?

00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.463
Why did you transfer to this school?

00:22:30.804 --> 00:22:31.998
What’s your goal?

00:23:09.639 --> 00:23:10.545
Hey, guys.

00:23:10.659 --> 00:23:11.753
Did you have any trouble finding my house?

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:13.009
No.

00:23:13.009 --> 00:23:14.818
We took the route you shared with us.

00:23:15.669 --> 00:23:17.053
Let’s get inside.

00:23:17.053 --> 00:23:18.739
Okay. Let me grab my bag.

00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:21.321
Can you grab it for me?

00:23:28.278 --> 00:23:29.071
Wat.

00:23:29.071 --> 00:23:29.798
Kan.

00:23:30.814 --> 00:23:31.816
How did he get here?

00:23:32.569 --> 00:23:33.567
I flew here, duh!

00:23:34.866 --> 00:23:36.866
He and Mo were waiting for us in front of the school.

00:23:36.866 --> 00:23:37.738
They aren’t members of any group yet.

00:23:38.033 --> 00:23:39.645
I couldn’t just neglect them.

00:23:39.983 --> 00:23:41.253
So I brought them here too.

00:23:42.923 --> 00:23:44.910
Why didn’t you ask me, you jackasses?

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:47.529
Come on. Why are you so serious?

00:23:47.791 --> 00:23:49.243
The more the merrier.

00:23:50.088 --> 00:23:50.849
Right?

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:53.869
Let’s get inside. I’m tired.

00:24:02.942 --> 00:24:04.075
I flew here.

00:24:20.074 --> 00:24:20.878
Wat,

00:24:21.814 --> 00:24:23.466
aren’t you filming videos today?

00:24:24.265 --> 00:24:25.877
No. I’m being lazy.

00:24:33.152 --> 00:24:35.152
Hey, will this do?

00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.110
I think so.

00:24:39.056 --> 00:24:40.554
What did you write down?

00:24:40.825 --> 00:24:46.294
All the living things I see around here.

00:24:46.789 --> 00:24:47.809
Kan.

00:24:48.539 --> 00:24:49.519
Kan!

00:24:49.708 --> 00:24:51.670
Are you daydreaming? Look into the camera.

00:24:52.277 --> 00:24:53.843
Why are you taking so many pictures?

00:24:53.843 --> 00:24:54.850
Oh, come on.

00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:58.068
Wat, is this your rock?

00:24:58.159 --> 00:24:58.967
Why?

00:24:59.008 --> 00:25:00.278
Because you rock!

00:25:01.838 --> 00:25:03.633
Just ignore his bad joke.

00:25:29.799 --> 00:25:32.110
One, two, three.I’m pumping air in you.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:35.886
Go on.

00:25:35.886 --> 00:25:37.983
Faster.

00:25:37.983 --> 00:25:39.040
Inflate him quicker.

00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:40.738
Do it quickly.

00:25:43.494 --> 00:25:45.129
Quickly, quickly.

00:25:46.345 --> 00:25:48.345
My head is about to explode.

00:27:04.502 --> 00:27:05.723
I’ll hold the post.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.895
You tie the string to the log there.

00:27:11.144 --> 00:27:12.467
Wat!

00:27:13.281 --> 00:27:14.390
Slow down.

00:27:15.033 --> 00:27:16.133
I want grilled squid.

00:27:16.726 --> 00:27:17.626
Grill it yourself.

00:27:20.751 --> 00:27:22.022
Guys.

00:27:23.848 --> 00:27:25.230
We’ll take a rest now.

00:27:25.772 --> 00:27:27.772
You guys have fun. Make yourselves at home.

00:27:27.831 --> 00:27:29.390
Goodnight, Mom and Dad.

00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:30.466
Goodnight.

00:27:30.636 --> 00:27:31.469
See you guys in the morning.

00:27:31.469 --> 00:27:32.910
Good night.

00:27:53.898 --> 00:27:55.122
Take one.

00:28:05.466 --> 00:28:06.576
Now what?

00:28:07.211 --> 00:28:09.659
A car is going at the speed of 200 km/hr.

00:28:09.659 --> 00:28:10.232
And?

00:28:10.232 --> 00:28:11.052
It’s too fast to brake.

00:28:13.381 --> 00:28:14.221
It crashes.

00:28:15.381 --> 00:28:19.630
One, two, three. Cheers!

00:28:19.868 --> 00:28:22.256
Guys, let’s play a game.

00:28:24.279 --> 00:28:25.347
What game?

00:28:26.077 --> 00:28:29.390
Guess who I am in Suppalo.

00:28:29.796 --> 00:28:30.830
Let’s do it.

00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:32.435
Bring it on.

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:35.178
Kanlong.

00:28:35.178 --> 00:28:36.390
Not yet. I haven’t started.

00:28:39.812 --> 00:28:43.615
Suppalo’s reputation is in your hand, Akk.

00:28:43.615 --> 00:28:44.540
Yes, sir.

00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.377
Teacher Chadok.

00:28:47.377 --> 00:28:48.660
You’re right.

00:28:48.996 --> 00:28:50.996
You don’t resemble Teacher Chadok at all.

00:28:51.264 --> 00:28:52.648
Of course, he does.

00:28:52.648 --> 00:28:53.526
Or you wouldn’t be able to answer that.

00:28:53.526 --> 00:28:54.952
He even looks like him.

00:28:55.283 --> 00:28:57.283
My chest is so upright. Of course, this is him.

00:28:57.283 --> 00:28:58.851
I have no idea why he has to do this.

00:29:00.189 --> 00:29:02.189
Next round.

00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:10.263
Kanlong,

00:29:11.001 --> 00:29:17.195
people who have been well-educated by their families…

00:29:17.195 --> 00:29:18.342
Aunt Waree.

00:29:18.430 --> 00:29:19.283
Correct!

00:29:19.283 --> 00:29:20.533
That wasn’t even close.

00:29:20.533 --> 00:29:22.067
Let me show you.

00:29:22.067 --> 00:29:23.074
Let’s see.

00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:26.985
I’m so disappointed in you, Kanlong.

00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:28.676
You’re a student in the best class.

00:29:29.066 --> 00:29:31.271
I did it better than him.

00:29:31.271 --> 00:29:33.040
You’re so bad at it.

00:29:34.552 --> 00:29:35.546
The next one.

00:29:35.546 --> 00:29:36.552
You’ll be my cameo.

00:29:42.868 --> 00:29:43.946
It’s okay.

00:29:44.699 --> 00:29:45.667
Take it easy.

00:29:46.631 --> 00:29:48.745
There are two sides to every coin.

00:29:49.283 --> 00:29:50.433
Teacher Dika.

00:29:50.433 --> 00:29:51.283
Correct.

00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:53.509
Was that good?

00:29:53.783 --> 00:29:55.206
Who’s next?

00:29:56.913 --> 00:29:58.320
I can’t imitate Teacher Sani.

00:29:59.254 --> 00:30:01.050
Show us something.

00:30:01.347 --> 00:30:02.464
You do it.

00:30:04.391 --> 00:30:06.391
Ouch! Where are you going?

00:30:06.391 --> 00:30:08.057
- You do it. 
- Me?

00:30:08.367 --> 00:30:09.390
I can’t.

00:30:35.674 --> 00:30:36.647
Uncle.

00:30:47.024 --> 00:30:48.476
I’m sorry.

00:30:52.459 --> 00:30:54.208
I will discover the truth as quickly as I can.

00:30:57.515 --> 00:30:58.785
I promise.

00:31:31.046 --> 00:31:33.046
Bottle, bottle, on the table,

00:31:33.655 --> 00:31:35.746
who has the most disturbing face of them all?

00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.289
Namo, play by the rule.

00:31:40.615 --> 00:31:42.615
Aye, you’re here?

00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:44.390
We’re about to play Truth or Dare.

00:31:44.511 --> 00:31:45.846
Let’s play.

00:31:45.846 --> 00:31:46.511
Let’s do it.

00:31:52.528 --> 00:31:54.094
The first one.

00:31:54.391 --> 00:31:55.383
Ask away.

00:31:57.437 --> 00:31:58.993
Do you have someone you like?

00:32:09.234 --> 00:32:11.234
I’ll drink. Give it to me.

00:32:12.743 --> 00:32:13.951
You’re not bold.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:17.650
Too much.

00:32:17.901 --> 00:32:18.643
Here.

00:32:23.659 --> 00:32:24.837
Not bad.

00:32:25.447 --> 00:32:26.603
My turn.

00:32:32.944 --> 00:32:34.119
Wat!

00:32:34.390 --> 00:32:35.443
Bring it on, Thua.

00:32:35.773 --> 00:32:37.550
I can answer all your questions.

00:32:39.785 --> 00:32:41.214
Which faculty are you applying to?

00:32:42.071 --> 00:32:45.190
Why did you ask such a serious question?

00:32:45.757 --> 00:32:46.823
Film.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.390
I’m studying Film.

00:32:51.439 --> 00:32:53.622
What about the faculty your parents chose for you?

00:32:54.506 --> 00:32:56.164
Screw it.

00:32:56.514 --> 00:32:57.966
This is my life.

00:32:57.966 --> 00:32:59.697
Yes!

00:32:59.697 --> 00:33:00.772
I will do whatever I want.

00:33:00.772 --> 00:33:03.320
Yes!

00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.864
What a badass.

00:33:05.574 --> 00:33:07.574
He’s only brave when he’s drunk.

00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:09.795
When he wakes up tomorrow,

00:33:09.795 --> 00:33:13.183
he’s back to being the boy who’s scared of his parents.

00:33:13.183 --> 00:33:14.536
I’ll kick you.

00:33:14.749 --> 00:33:15.922
Wat, your turn.

00:33:16.493 --> 00:33:17.320
Right.

00:33:25.097 --> 00:33:26.001
Aye!

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.456
What should I ask you, Aye?

00:33:34.187 --> 00:33:35.710
Why did you transfer to this school?

00:33:39.391 --> 00:33:40.661
What’s your goal?

00:33:57.830 --> 00:33:59.191
Easy there.

00:33:59.547 --> 00:34:01.670
We can’t let him beat us.

00:34:01.796 --> 00:34:04.184
You’re such a good drinker, Aye.

00:34:05.273 --> 00:34:06.710
Drink up.

00:34:08.698 --> 00:34:10.179
Don’t let Aye drink alone.

00:34:11.018 --> 00:34:13.340
Cheers.

00:36:09.808 --> 00:36:10.772
What’s on your mind?

00:36:23.401 --> 00:36:28.556
That notebook is a reminder of someone

00:36:31.493 --> 00:36:32.940
who has left this world.

00:36:39.318 --> 00:36:40.209
Akk,

00:36:42.466 --> 00:36:44.174
if you know who took it,

00:36:48.118 --> 00:36:49.381
please let me know.

00:37:10.443 --> 00:37:11.767
You’re allowed to be weak.

00:37:14.715 --> 00:37:16.082
At least with me.

00:37:20.475 --> 00:37:22.337
You said that to me, remember?

00:37:25.139 --> 00:37:27.323
I’m saying the same thing to you now.

00:38:05.612 --> 00:38:07.612
Did you get any sleep yet, boys?

00:38:09.006 --> 00:38:10.287
We did, a little.

00:38:10.557 --> 00:38:12.773
Where are you two going this early?

00:38:13.118 --> 00:38:14.454
We’re going fishing.

00:38:14.454 --> 00:38:16.200
We head out now and come back in the morning.

00:38:18.276 --> 00:38:19.792
Can I come?

00:38:20.538 --> 00:38:23.551
I don’t think that’s a good idea.
We’re going further than usual.

00:38:25.947 --> 00:38:28.292
Akk, you can take your friend out on this boat.

00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:29.635
Don’t go too far.

00:38:30.441 --> 00:38:31.326
Go on.

00:38:31.973 --> 00:38:33.466
- But Mom…
- Thank you.

00:38:33.758 --> 00:38:34.768
Take care of your friend.

00:38:49.715 --> 00:38:51.027
Sit tight.

00:38:53.791 --> 00:38:54.479
Yeah.

00:39:16.808 --> 00:39:18.301
You’re looking happy.

00:39:20.412 --> 00:39:21.349
I sure am.

00:39:23.007 --> 00:39:24.554
Your secret island is beautiful.

00:39:26.146 --> 00:39:27.593
I told you it’s beautiful.

00:39:33.435 --> 00:39:34.377
Akk

00:39:36.081 --> 00:39:37.484
What will you do about that?

00:39:45.454 --> 00:39:46.570
Do I need to do anything?

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:48.744
You do.

00:39:50.164 --> 00:39:52.026
What you did was wrong.

00:39:53.118 --> 00:39:55.717
Are you gonna let people continue to believe in the curse?

00:40:00.995 --> 00:40:02.049
I know.

00:40:05.365 --> 00:40:06.933
I just don’t know what I should do.

00:40:09.075 --> 00:40:09.959
I’m afraid.

00:40:11.075 --> 00:40:12.629
I’m afraid everything will change.

00:40:16.242 --> 00:40:17.005
Akk

00:40:18.237 --> 00:40:21.017
It isn’t just me who is looking into this.

00:40:22.155 --> 00:40:23.556
Teacher Sani is.

00:40:23.917 --> 00:40:25.180
The World Remembers group is.

00:40:26.255 --> 00:40:30.512
Though I don’t tell people about this, it will be exposed one day.

00:40:34.998 --> 00:40:38.610
Better confess it before that to save yourself.

00:40:49.137 --> 00:40:50.815
I have something to thank you for.

00:40:51.889 --> 00:40:52.800
For what?

00:40:57.406 --> 00:40:59.209
The night I had a nightmare.

00:41:01.516 --> 00:41:03.117
Thanks for comforting me with your hug.

00:41:03.839 --> 00:41:05.305
Weren’t you asleep?

00:41:05.973 --> 00:41:06.806
I wasn’t.

00:41:13.709 --> 00:41:15.237
Your embrace was so warm.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:19.864
Shut up.

00:41:22.449 --> 00:41:23.395
Get on the boat.

00:41:25.076 --> 00:41:26.242
Are you running away now?

00:41:27.739 --> 00:41:28.573
Akk.

00:41:30.048 --> 00:41:31.272
Get on the boat.

00:41:33.552 --> 00:41:34.789
Akk, wait.

00:41:35.114 --> 00:41:36.446
Well, hurry up.

00:44:20.203 --> 00:44:21.352
Are you avoiding me?

00:44:21.905 --> 00:44:22.848
I’m not.

00:44:23.118 --> 00:44:24.496
I just wanted to sit at the stern.

00:44:25.778 --> 00:44:26.503
Yeah?

00:44:26.503 --> 00:44:27.340
Yeah.

00:44:33.413 --> 00:44:36.611
When you talk to me, look into my eyes.

00:44:42.977 --> 00:44:43.710
All right.

00:45:20.032 --> 00:45:25.832
Directed by Tanwarin Sukkhapisit

00:45:26.402 --> 00:45:28.117
I will tell you my feelings

00:45:28.487 --> 00:45:30.303
and you will tell me yours.

00:45:32.184 --> 00:45:34.184
I don’t want you to get hurt because of me again.

00:45:34.535 --> 00:45:35.480
It’s okay.

00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:36.765
I can bear the pain.

00:45:36.765 --> 00:45:39.852
Besides, I want to protect you.

00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:41.475
[Don’t join the protest if you don’t to be cursed.]

00:45:41.475 --> 00:45:43.709
 The head of that gang is Ayan.

00:45:44.169 --> 00:45:45.570
Can you leave this school?

00:45:45.570 --> 00:45:49.381
Whatever you will do, you know I’m on your side.
