00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,468
<i>I've lived in this city
all my life.</i>

3
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,885
<i>I'm Max.</i>

4
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,434
<i>And I'm the luckiest dog
in New York,</i>

5
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,068
<i>because of her.</i>

6
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,702
<i>That's Katie.</i>

7
00:01:36,102 --> 00:01:37,211
<i>Katie and I...</i>

8
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,200
<i>Well, we have a perfect relationship.</i>

9
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,525
<i>We met a few years ago. And...</i>

10
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,222
<i>Boy, let me tell you,
we got along right away.</i>

11
00:01:45,892 --> 00:01:47,849
<i>You know, it was one of those
relationships where...</i>

12
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,702
<i>Where you just know.</i>

13
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:54,537
<i>And get this. She was
looking for a roommate,</i>

14
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,874
<i>and so was I!</i>

15
00:01:55,874 --> 00:01:58,582
<i>So, I just moved in
that same day!</i>

16
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,471
<i>Was perfect!</i>

17
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,120
<i>We've been togather ever since.</i>

18
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,280
<i>Katie would do
anything for me.</i>

19
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:09,725
<i>And I'm her lawyer protector.</i>

20
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,868
<i>Our love is...</i>

21
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,320
<i>Our love is,
how do I put this?</i>

22
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:21,310
<i>Our love is stronger
than words,</i>

23
00:02:21,536 --> 00:02:23,160
<i>Or shoes.</i>

24
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,217
<i>It's me and Katie.</i>

25
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,605
<i>Kaite and me.</i>

26
00:02:31,531 --> 00:02:33,291
<i>Us against the world.</i>

27
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,182
<i>I wouldn't go so far as
to call us soulmates,</i>

28
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:45,315
<i>Even though, any sane
person who saw us would.</i>

29
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:04,360
<i>There's just one little problem.</i>

30
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,897
<i>- Pretty much, everyday!</i>
- Come on, Max!

31
00:03:07,908 --> 00:03:09,508
<i>She leaves!</i>

32
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,611
I'll see you tonight.

33
00:03:11,622 --> 00:03:14,490
<i>Sometime I try stuff
to get her to stay!</i>

34
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,222
Okay, sit.

35
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,428
Spin.

36
00:03:20,468 --> 00:03:21,748
Speak.

37
00:03:22,571 --> 00:03:24,720
Okay, that's a good boy.

38
00:03:24,857 --> 00:03:26,422
<i>But, it never works!</i>

39
00:03:27,588 --> 00:03:29,142
<i>Where is she going?</i>

40
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,314
<i>What could she possibly
be doing?</i>

41
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,502
I miss her so much!

42
00:03:39,897 --> 00:03:42,605
Wow, oh my...
oh, she's back!

43
00:03:43,074 --> 00:03:44,262
Forgot my phone!

44
00:03:44,262 --> 00:03:46,477
What took so long?
why did you...?

45
00:03:46,582 --> 00:03:48,365
Oh, come on!

46
00:03:49,508 --> 00:03:50,662
Uhh!

47
00:03:50,674 --> 00:03:52,902
I miss her so much!

48
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,954
Bye, Gidget!
Be a good doggy.

49
00:04:03,405 --> 00:04:05,805
- Hey, Max!
- Hey, Gidget!

50
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,360
Any plans today?

51
00:04:07,417 --> 00:04:10,068
Yes. Big, big
stuff today, Gidget.

52
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,645
I got big plans.
I'm gonna sit here

53
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:13,748
and I'm gonna wait for
Katie to come back.

54
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,280
Oh, that sounds exciting.

55
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:17,154
Well, I won't interrupt.

56
00:04:17,165 --> 00:04:19,920
I've got a very busy day, too.

57
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:25,577
Here you go.

58
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,371
See you later, Chloe.

59
00:04:34,068 --> 00:04:35,314
Bye, Peppi.

60
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:46,822
So long, Mel.

61
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:52,194
Bye, Sweet Pea.

62
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,400
See you, Gino.

63
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:56,110
- Sorry, pal.
- bye, Mitsy.

64
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,954
I'll miss you, Shelly.

65
00:04:57,970 --> 00:04:59,028
Later, Runty.

66
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,331
Bye, everyone.

67
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,440
Bye.

68
00:06:56,422 --> 00:06:58,651
You be a good boy, Leonard.

69
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:12,057
Hey, Max!

70
00:07:12,068 --> 00:07:13,110
Hey, Chloe.

71
00:07:13,116 --> 00:07:15,585
Do you ever wonder
where they go during the day?

72
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,594
Do you know what?
I just, I don't really care.

73
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,354
Maybe that's what it's
like for you,

74
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,617
but, Katie and I have
a different relationship.

75
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:24,961
You know, you're a cat,
so, maybe that's why.

76
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,308
'cause nobody could
ever love a cat

77
00:07:26,331 --> 00:07:28,285
the way they love a dog,
I'm just saying.

78
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:29,474
Maybe that's why.

79
00:07:29,497 --> 00:07:31,400
Whatever you need
to tell yourself.

80
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,430
- Hey, Morning, Max!
- Hey, guys.

81
00:07:40,868 --> 00:07:42,540
What's up, Sweet Pea?

82
00:07:43,485 --> 00:07:45,531
Hey, Mel.
Where've you been, man?

83
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:46,950
Oh! Get this.

84
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:50,087
Last sunday, my owner feeds me
a small white pill, right?

85
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,954
I start to feel little groggy.

86
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:54,925
The next thing I know
I wake up, I'm in the sky!

87
00:07:54,937 --> 00:07:56,285
Wait a minute, the sky?

88
00:07:56,297 --> 00:07:57,928
Yeah, there was
suitcases everywhere.

89
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,965
- I'm locked up in a crate!
- come on!

90
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,508
There's suitcases in the sky?

91
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,200
So, I pass out from fear.

92
00:08:03,222 --> 00:08:05,691
And when I wake up,
I'm in Florida!

93
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:07,530
Um, this did not happend.

94
00:08:07,531 --> 00:08:09,771
I will never eat a pill
like that again,

95
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,257
unless it's covered in
peanut butter.

96
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:14,868
Because, I mean come on, right?
It's peanut butter.

97
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:18,274
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, hey, Norman.

98
00:08:18,285 --> 00:08:20,250
You still looking for
your apartment?

99
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,619
Yeah, going on three weeks, now.

100
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:24,554
Is this the second
or the third floor?

101
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:27,491
I don't know any numbers
but, you don't live here.

102
00:08:27,557 --> 00:08:28,892
Oh, damn it.

103
00:08:28,914 --> 00:08:31,005
Well, see you guys later.

104
00:08:31,771 --> 00:08:33,622
You know what?
You can do it.

105
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:35,270
Can't do it.

106
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:39,198
Buddy, there you are.
Did you find it?

107
00:08:40,537 --> 00:08:42,061
You know I did.

108
00:08:43,173 --> 00:08:44,406
Voila.

109
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,034
- Ball!
- Ball!

110
00:08:46,034 --> 00:08:47,711
Ball! Ball! Ball!

111
00:08:48,145 --> 00:08:49,613
Katie is gonna be
so excited.

112
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,782
This is exactly that
what she lost.

113
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:54,740
I mean, look at it. It's round,
it fits in my mouth.

114
00:08:55,852 --> 00:08:57,320
- Ball!
- Yeah!

115
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,285
Oh!

116
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:11,230
There is no other ball
in the city like this one ball.

117
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:13,260
Guarantee, this is the ball.

118
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,948
Hey!

119
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,080
- Katie!
- I'm home, Max.

120
00:09:27,884 --> 00:09:30,720
Hey, Maximillian.
How's your day, buddy?

121
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,617
That's a good boy.

122
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,114
Oh, yes. I'm so excited
to see you too, buddy.

123
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,417
Okay, boy. Calm down.
It's okay. Let's all be calm.

124
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:42,699
Now, I have some big news.

125
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:46,203
I know this will take some
getting used to, but...

126
00:09:46,651 --> 00:09:49,506
but, I think it's gonna be
a great thing in the long...

127
00:09:50,674 --> 00:09:53,109
Max.
This is, Duke.

128
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:57,848
He's going to be
your... brother.

129
00:10:00,068 --> 00:10:02,118
No, no. Max. Okay.

130
00:10:02,388 --> 00:10:05,130
It's gonna be alright, Duke.
It's okay.

131
00:10:12,971 --> 00:10:15,460
Oh, see?
He likes you.

132
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,840
Yeah. That's it, Duke.
Take a look around.

133
00:10:26,009 --> 00:10:29,312
I know, buddy.
This is a lot to take in, but...

134
00:10:29,622 --> 00:10:31,181
he didn't have a home.

135
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:33,717
So, you and I are gonna
have to take care of him.

136
00:10:34,651 --> 00:10:35,585
Okay?

137
00:10:37,394 --> 00:10:40,757
Oh my Gosh!
Duke, found our lost ball.

138
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,185
What a great team
we're gonna be.

139
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,210
Love you, Maxi.

140
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:05,199
Love you, Duke.

141
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:13,058
Sleep tight, boys.

142
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,594
Psst!

143
00:11:19,029 --> 00:11:20,163
Pssst!

144
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:23,497
Hey! Little guy!

145
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,900
This place is so great.

146
00:11:26,445 --> 00:11:27,630
Uh-huh.

147
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:30,674
By the way that is...
That is one gorgeous bed.

148
00:11:31,074 --> 00:11:32,776
Yeah, that's okay.

149
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:34,144
Maybe we could share.

150
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,068
You know, one night
you get the bed,

151
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,747
the next night I do.

152
00:11:37,771 --> 00:11:40,365
- That kind of thing.
- Yo, this bed is mine.

153
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,553
You? You get an old blanket.
That suits you.

154
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:46,090
You're an old blanket
kind of a dog.

155
00:11:46,228 --> 00:11:49,451
Oh, wow.
You are a stubborn.

156
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,114
Hey, I got it.
I'm stubborn, too.

157
00:11:52,137 --> 00:11:54,497
- But, we gotta learn to get along.
- Wait, what are you...?

158
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:56,182
How about we can both
fit in this bed,

159
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,934
if we really trying on
squeeze in there.

160
00:11:57,931 --> 00:11:59,090
No, wait.

161
00:11:59,348 --> 00:12:02,194
Perfect.
This is comfy, right?

162
00:12:02,194 --> 00:12:04,190
No, it is not.

163
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,013
I'm comfy.

164
00:12:08,365 --> 00:12:10,240
Duke is just ruining our lives.

165
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,554
He's ruin... It's an emergency
that you get rid of this dog.

166
00:12:13,577 --> 00:12:14,830
He stool my...

167
00:12:17,268 --> 00:12:18,868
And he's scary,
and he's threatening,

168
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,982
and he's the death
of all good things.

169
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:23,259
Oh! You little cutie pie!

170
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,250
We'll play tomorrow buddy, okay?

171
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,628
Okay, sleep well.

172
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:30,285
Are you trying to get rid of me?

173
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,942
Before I answer that...

174
00:12:32,422 --> 00:12:34,742
I'd like to know
how much you heard.

175
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,754
So, that's how it's gonna be, huh?

176
00:12:36,765 --> 00:12:39,268
Oh man!
You're making me angry.

177
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,080
And when I get angry,
I do this...

178
00:12:43,885 --> 00:12:45,577
And I don't want to do that.

179
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:47,083
I need this place.

180
00:12:47,097 --> 00:12:49,686
And if it's gonna
come down to you or me?

181
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,680
It's gonna be me!

182
00:12:57,494 --> 00:12:58,695
Ahh!

183
00:13:44,422 --> 00:13:45,640
Morning, Max!

184
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,640
Max! Max!
What are you doing?

185
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Hi, it's me. Hi!

186
00:13:51,414 --> 00:13:52,415
Chloe!

187
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,748
Chloe, Chloe!
I got a bad situation.

188
00:13:56,342 --> 00:13:58,850
Katie brought home
a new dog from the pound!

189
00:13:58,868 --> 00:14:01,394
She said, he's my brother.
I don't want a brother.

190
00:14:01,394 --> 00:14:03,460
And I don't, I don't even
have a bed, now.

191
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:05,460
I'm sleeping on the floor,
like a dog.

192
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,630
Why would Katie do this to me?

193
00:14:07,645 --> 00:14:09,960
Because, she's a dog person, Max.

194
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,434
And dog people do wierd,
inexplicable things, like...

195
00:14:14,582 --> 00:14:16,377
they get dogs instead of cats.

196
00:14:16,388 --> 00:14:18,475
Okay, please
don't start now, Chloe.

197
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:19,828
That is not helping.

198
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,880
Max, come on!
I'm your friend, okay?

199
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,742
And as your friend,
I gotta be honest with you,

200
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,628
I don't care about you
or your problems.

201
00:14:26,777 --> 00:14:29,771
But, if you don't do
something about this guy.

202
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:30,742
And soon,

203
00:14:30,742 --> 00:14:33,710
your perfect little life
with your dump human...

204
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:35,458
is gonna be over.

205
00:14:35,462 --> 00:14:37,245
- Forever.
- Forever?

206
00:14:37,257 --> 00:14:39,257
Foreve, yeah.
That's what I just...

207
00:14:39,817 --> 00:14:43,099
Why is this mouse
on my paw still?

208
00:14:43,099 --> 00:14:43,977
Ahh.

209
00:14:43,977 --> 00:14:46,845
Look, if you really want to
get your turf back,

210
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,074
you're gonna have to star
acting like the alpha dog.

211
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,537
Right, alpha dog.
I can do that.

212
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,320
- Okay! Okay!
- Please, don't go.

213
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,851
This time, really don't go.

214
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,337
Okay, I'm running late.
I gotta go.

215
00:14:57,348 --> 00:14:58,915
Wait, wait! No!
Stay, stay for the trick.

216
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,125
Spin. I'm doing spin.

217
00:15:00,137 --> 00:15:01,584
You guys be good.
I'll see you later.

218
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,257
- Wait. No, no. Wait, look.
- Okay, Max.

219
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,205
Oh!

220
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:14,798
Listen, Duke.
I'm not sure if you're aware,

221
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:19,897
but, one of those food bowls
technically, it's reserved for...

222
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:22,730
I know, maybe you didn't
read the names, but...

223
00:15:22,807 --> 00:15:23,907
That's my bowl.

224
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:24,808
Um.

225
00:15:26,582 --> 00:15:28,320
I know, that's... Hey!

226
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,771
I mean, I was just thinking...

227
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:32,400
I don't know, maybe we could
institute some ground rules.

228
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,560
I just thought that if...

229
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,287
Or... Or not. I, I don't,
I don't need a bowl.

230
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:38,160
Here again?

231
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,160
- Rodent!
- Whoa, whoa. No, no!

232
00:15:40,697 --> 00:15:42,160
Aah!

233
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:43,626
Oh!

234
00:15:45,314 --> 00:15:46,251
Dah!

235
00:15:48,594 --> 00:15:50,060
Oh, Duke!

236
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,634
Duke, Katie is not...

237
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:54,237
Katie is gonna be upset
when she sees that.

238
00:15:54,237 --> 00:15:57,006
Katie is...
gonna flip out

239
00:15:57,006 --> 00:16:00,810
when she sees how
you trashed her whole place.

240
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:03,146
Oh, it's just,
it's just one vase.

241
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:05,462
Is it, Duke? Is it?

242
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,000
Oh! That's a shame.

243
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:12,998
- What are you doing?
- Whoa! What am I doing?

244
00:16:13,229 --> 00:16:16,313
Nothing.
I'm, I'm a cute little doggie.

245
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:19,992
Katie knows I wouldn't do
anything like this!

246
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,898
No, no! Whoa!

247
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:22,765
Uhh!

248
00:16:24,749 --> 00:16:28,276
This could only be the work
of a dangerous stray...

249
00:16:28,628 --> 00:16:31,737
who hasn't lay down
a foundation of trust.

250
00:16:31,737 --> 00:16:33,376
You're the new dog.

251
00:16:33,714 --> 00:16:36,670
And... Hey, Duke!
Why'd you going do this for?

252
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,388
Argh! I'm gonna...

253
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:41,020
Whoa! What, bite me?
Rip my face off?

254
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:43,257
Perfect.
Wait till Katie finds out,

255
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,908
"Oh! Katie, thank Godness
you're here."

256
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,860
"I tried to stop him.
But, he's crazy!"

257
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:50,990
Uh!

258
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,420
Huh!

259
00:16:52,424 --> 00:16:54,097
Now, sit!

260
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,090
Okay! Okay! Okay!

261
00:16:58,469 --> 00:17:00,469
Lay down.

262
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:01,969
Argh!

263
00:17:01,969 --> 00:17:03,969
Good boy.

264
00:17:20,114 --> 00:17:22,388
- Hi, Max!
- Hey, Gidget!

265
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:23,826
Who's your new roommate?

266
00:17:23,826 --> 00:17:25,536
Is it a girl dog, or a boy dog?

267
00:17:25,536 --> 00:17:27,201
Not that I care.
It doesn't matter to me.

268
00:17:27,301 --> 00:17:29,932
Oh, that's nobody, Gidget.
He's just visiting.

269
00:17:30,032 --> 00:17:32,522
Yeah, he, he's gonna
be gone, soon.

270
00:17:42,465 --> 00:17:45,090
- Hey! What's up?
- Oh, Hi!

271
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,880
Your hat is best hat
I ever seen.

272
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,650
Hey!

273
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:51,872
Uhh, excuse me, genius.
You forgot my leash.

274
00:17:51,872 --> 00:17:54,747
Ohh! Never mind.

275
00:17:56,045 --> 00:17:57,920
Hey, fellas.
Who's it... Woah!

276
00:17:58,754 --> 00:18:00,610
Hey, fellas.
Who's it... Uhwah!

277
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:03,110
Hey! Fellas!
Huweeh!

278
00:18:03,909 --> 00:18:06,504
- Oh! Say, Duke?
- Yes?

279
00:18:06,834 --> 00:18:09,660
Be a good lad and
bring me a stick, won't you?

280
00:18:09,761 --> 00:18:14,050
It would please me to
chew on a stick just now.

281
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,422
You heard me.
Fetch.

282
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,794
Argh!

283
00:18:20,068 --> 00:18:24,022
Na, na, na. Not that one.
That one doesn't please me.

284
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:25,817
Find a really good one, Duke.

285
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,520
Yeah, that's it.

286
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,520
Argh.

287
00:18:38,731 --> 00:18:40,203
Hey, Max! boy!

288
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,348
Oh, wow! There are a ton of
sticks over here, Max!

289
00:18:43,565 --> 00:18:45,131
You should come over
and look at them.

290
00:18:45,154 --> 00:18:47,691
Yeah, I want to make sure
I grab the right one.

291
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:50,490
Well, that's very...
That's very thoughtful.

292
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:55,650
Look at all these sticks!

293
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,053
Ha!

294
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,820
Whoa! Help! Help!

295
00:19:00,217 --> 00:19:01,980
Hey, did you hear that?

296
00:19:02,491 --> 00:19:03,480
Butterfly!

297
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:06,496
- Butterfly! Butterfly!
- Oh, butterfly! Let's get it!

298
00:19:11,531 --> 00:19:12,880
Wha... What's....

299
00:19:13,428 --> 00:19:16,194
Ahh! Whoa! Ahhh!

300
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,051
Oh!

301
00:19:17,211 --> 00:19:18,102
Aww!

302
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:19,742
Ahh!

303
00:19:20,674 --> 00:19:22,240
Oh! Ahh!

304
00:19:22,765 --> 00:19:24,240
Ahh!

305
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,617
Ahhh!

306
00:19:27,954 --> 00:19:29,702
Ahh! Oh! Oh!

307
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,451
Argh!

308
00:19:31,451 --> 00:19:33,033
Wow! Uhh!

309
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,982
Hel.. Hel.. Help
Help, Help!

310
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:37,393
- So long.
- Don't leave me here.

311
00:19:37,394 --> 00:19:39,005
Didn't have to be this way, Max.

312
00:19:39,028 --> 00:19:40,811
- Wait!
- No heart feelings.

313
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:42,845
Duke, Please!

314
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:47,268
- Boy, what's going on here?
- Mind your own business...

315
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,730
Oh my Gosh!
What happened to you?

316
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,500
Oh, I had a fight, alright?

317
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:54,182
With a big stupid dog.
He lost.

318
00:19:54,290 --> 00:19:58,308
Oh! You're heading into a dangerous
territory there, kitty cat!

319
00:19:58,308 --> 00:20:00,600
I'd watch your tone, sunshine.

320
00:20:00,707 --> 00:20:02,118
Know what I'm gonna do?

321
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:03,805
I'm gonna catch you
into a string,

322
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:07,177
pull you up, and then I bet
you run for hours,

323
00:20:07,188 --> 00:20:09,610
in a game that only I understand.

324
00:20:09,885 --> 00:20:11,497
Oh. Very nice.

325
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:13,337
I'll take that!

326
00:20:13,622 --> 00:20:14,468
Huh?

327
00:20:16,868 --> 00:20:18,100
Oh!

328
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,628
Oh!
huh! Whoo-hoo!

329
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,605
You want to start
with me, little raisin?

330
00:20:23,542 --> 00:20:25,862
Okay, get your umbrellas out, kitties.

331
00:20:25,862 --> 00:20:27,977
Because, here they come...

332
00:20:27,988 --> 00:20:32,250
The thunder! And the lightning!
Right down on your face.

333
00:20:36,925 --> 00:20:39,451
Gosh, there are a lot
of you up there.

334
00:20:39,462 --> 00:20:40,990
I'm talking about thunder
and lightning,

335
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:43,782
and it's coming down on all
of your collected faces.

336
00:20:44,091 --> 00:20:47,050
Attack on, three, two...

337
00:20:47,563 --> 00:20:49,298
Ahhhh!

338
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:50,480
Ohh!

339
00:20:51,531 --> 00:20:54,260
I just remember,
I gotta be somewhere!

340
00:20:54,363 --> 00:20:55,821
Ha-ha! That...

341
00:20:55,938 --> 00:20:59,342
Haha, ha! That guy, huh?
Am I right?

342
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,274
Okay, I'm just...
You know what?

343
00:21:02,274 --> 00:21:04,270
I'm just gonna...
It's no offense, but... Bye!

344
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,017
Ohh!

345
00:21:09,152 --> 00:21:10,286
Whoaa!

346
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:12,582
Ahh! Whoa! Whoa!

347
00:21:12,582 --> 00:21:14,580
Ahhhh!

348
00:21:15,462 --> 00:21:16,297
Uhh!

349
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,290
Uh-huh!

350
00:21:22,465 --> 00:21:24,734
Whoa! Ahhh!

351
00:21:24,734 --> 00:21:28,504
Ahhh! Ahhhh!

352
00:21:28,777 --> 00:21:30,130
Huh?

353
00:21:31,574 --> 00:21:32,708
Ha!

354
00:21:33,211 --> 00:21:34,114
He-Huh!

355
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,462
Hey!

356
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,794
Hey, you little...

357
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:39,531
Whoaa!

358
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,908
Whoaa! ohh!

359
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:43,611
Ahh! Uh!

360
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,360
Blah!

361
00:21:47,691 --> 00:21:48,910
Duke?

362
00:21:50,114 --> 00:21:52,460
- You came back?
- Run!

363
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,428
Whoa! Ahhh!

364
00:21:55,908 --> 00:21:56,902
Wow!

365
00:21:57,051 --> 00:21:59,300
It's the Po-Po! Scram!

366
00:22:04,331 --> 00:22:05,085
Hay!

367
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,376
Huh! Ah! Whoah!

368
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:10,307
Wait!

369
00:22:14,417 --> 00:22:17,420
Two, four, six, eight.
Mmmm.

370
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,740
- See you tomorrow, Germo!
- You know it.

371
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:22,637
Ten...
Ah, okay.

372
00:22:23,177 --> 00:22:24,290
Right.

373
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,302
Uh-Huh.

374
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:29,520
- Did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw it.

375
00:22:29,542 --> 00:22:32,285
Throw it with your arm,
you lazy weirdo.

376
00:22:32,308 --> 00:22:34,380
I would not fetch that.
I'm old school.

377
00:22:42,605 --> 00:22:43,740
Ahh!

378
00:22:46,148 --> 00:22:48,184
Humph! Thanks a lot, Duke.

379
00:22:48,194 --> 00:22:49,852
I don't like to use this phrase,

380
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:53,165
because it is offensive to our kind,
but you're a bad dog.

381
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,211
Katie is not gonna like this.

382
00:22:55,210 --> 00:22:57,440
I, I can't go to the pound!

383
00:22:58,548 --> 00:23:00,937
What?
What's wrong with you?

384
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:02,565
Well, Katie just...

385
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,165
She just got me out
of the pound.

386
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,180
And if I go back...

387
00:23:08,377 --> 00:23:10,422
Back it's the end of
the life for me.

388
00:23:18,102 --> 00:23:20,457
<i>La pasión de la pasión.</i>

389
00:23:20,537 --> 00:23:22,610
Ha! Yes! Mmmm.

390
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:25,497
<i>Why? Why?!</i>

391
00:23:25,508 --> 00:23:27,142
What's the matter, Maria?

392
00:23:27,144 --> 00:23:28,811
Maria, your face!

393
00:23:28,822 --> 00:23:31,942
It worths a thousand souls.
What's wrong?

394
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:36,468
<i>I have come face-to-face
with a worst thing in the world!</i>

395
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,577
What? Oh, tell me, Maria.
Tell me now!

396
00:23:39,588 --> 00:23:42,194
I can not bear another moment
without knowing!

397
00:23:42,205 --> 00:23:43,920
Loneliness.

398
00:23:44,194 --> 00:23:45,120
Huh!

399
00:23:45,348 --> 00:23:46,514
Huh!

400
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:49,458
- <i>But, Maria. You can not be lonely.</i>
- Ha! Max. Max!

401
00:23:49,668 --> 00:23:51,748
Max! Huh?

402
00:23:51,954 --> 00:23:53,883
Hey! I see you, squirrel!

403
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,388
This is not your area!
We marked that tree!

404
00:23:57,111 --> 00:23:59,811
Don't you trying hide.
I can see you... Ahh!

405
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,634
What was that?
How dare you?

406
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:03,120
- Hey, guys! Where's Max?
- Hey! No!

407
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:05,380
Nobody likes you, squirrels!

408
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:07,380
- No! Aww!
- Ahh!

409
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,148
Guys, seriously.
Where is Max?

410
00:24:10,148 --> 00:24:12,140
Calm down, girl.
He's right...

411
00:24:12,457 --> 00:24:14,114
Huh! He's gone.

412
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,120
All is fine!

413
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,808
I heard him screaming after
he disappeared into those bushes!

414
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,800
Max is gone?

415
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,800
This is bad.
This is so bad.

416
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,116
<i>Maria, if he's your true love.</i>

417
00:24:27,131 --> 00:24:29,325
<i>You must go to him.</i>

418
00:24:29,325 --> 00:24:31,554
<i>Save him. Save him!</i>

419
00:24:31,874 --> 00:24:34,617
Yes! Yes!
Save my true love!

420
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,480
<i>Run! Come on! Go!</i>

421
00:24:36,502 --> 00:24:38,230
I'm coming, Max!

422
00:24:40,563 --> 00:24:42,698
Aahhh!

423
00:24:42,845 --> 00:24:44,690
Aaahh!

424
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:50,422
Hi, Chloe. If anyone ask,

425
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:52,420
I'm on my way to the roof
to look for, Max.

426
00:24:54,443 --> 00:24:55,644
Okay, Bye-bye.

427
00:25:04,445 --> 00:25:06,100
Whoa! You see that?

428
00:25:06,891 --> 00:25:08,550
Yeah, give me a second.

429
00:25:11,188 --> 00:25:13,645
Aww! Hey, there cute little bunny.

430
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,194
What are you doing
in the middle of the road?

431
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:18,768
Aahhh!

432
00:25:23,874 --> 00:25:24,880
Bunny!

433
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,988
Huh?

434
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,180
Hey, what's going on?

435
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:29,945
What the...?

436
00:25:31,474 --> 00:25:33,880
- Save yourself!
- Shut it, human.

437
00:25:33,989 --> 00:25:36,920
Let's dow this now!
Now! Now!

438
00:25:44,445 --> 00:25:46,080
Wait up!

439
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,080
Get off me, pig!

440
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,498
Ooh! Ouch!

441
00:25:49,498 --> 00:25:50,599
Get off!

442
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,205
Whoo-ooh! Aah!

443
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:57,870
Whoah!

444
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,930
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

445
00:26:06,171 --> 00:26:08,360
Ripper?
Ripper, where you at?

446
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:11,654
Let's go, Ripper.
I'm bustin' you outta here.

447
00:26:17,211 --> 00:26:18,914
The revolution has begun!

448
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,445
Librated forever!
Domesticated never!

449
00:26:22,445 --> 00:26:24,440
Yeah!

450
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:26,068
Ouch!

451
00:26:26,468 --> 00:26:28,290
Who's driving this thing?

452
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:34,109
Whoo-hoo!

453
00:26:37,222 --> 00:26:38,980
Aaahhh!

454
00:26:42,718 --> 00:26:43,752
Ah!

455
00:26:49,097 --> 00:26:50,860
Ha-ha! Huh!

456
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:58,057
Ooh!

457
00:27:00,731 --> 00:27:02,900
Let's go.
Let's go! Let's go!

458
00:27:06,411 --> 00:27:08,251
- Who are you, guys?
- Huh?

459
00:27:08,262 --> 00:27:09,345
Who are we?

460
00:27:09,345 --> 00:27:11,340
Who are we?!

461
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,434
We are The Flushed Pets.

462
00:27:14,777 --> 00:27:18,571
Thrown away by our owners,
and now we're out for revenge!

463
00:27:18,731 --> 00:27:21,820
It's like a club but with
biting and scratching.

464
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,770
Ta.. Take us with you.

465
00:27:25,461 --> 00:27:27,496
I don't think so, pets.

466
00:27:27,508 --> 00:27:30,125
Yeah, you got the stench of
domestication all over you.

467
00:27:30,342 --> 00:27:33,154
You chose your side.
And now you're gonna burn.

468
00:27:33,177 --> 00:27:35,497
No! stop!
Who you calling pets?

469
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:36,617
I ain't no pets.

470
00:27:36,617 --> 00:27:38,777
You got it all wrong.
We're just like you, guys.

471
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:39,988
We hate humans.

472
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,600
- Oh, yeah! That's right.
- Hate them.

473
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:44,457
Oh, man. Don't get me started
on people. Am I right, Duke?

474
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,031
Yeah, That's why
we burned our collars, man!

475
00:27:47,057 --> 00:27:50,050
- We burned 'em to the ground.
- It killed our owners.

476
00:27:50,068 --> 00:27:52,087
Yeah... Wait a minute.
That's too far, maybe?

477
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:52,868
No, they dig it.

478
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,834
- Yes, we whacked 'em.
- Yeah, that's right.

479
00:27:54,857 --> 00:27:56,594
Bang! Bang!
With our own paws.

480
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,662
I had a dime
for every owner I kill.

481
00:27:58,674 --> 00:28:00,830
- Oh, yeah.
- I had a dime...

482
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,668
'Cause I just killed the one.

483
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:06,080
Whoo-ooh!

484
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:07,803
Oh, you're cold-blooded.

485
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,160
Oh man, you remind me
my boy, Ricky.

486
00:28:10,347 --> 00:28:13,499
He died, tho.
R.I.P, Ricky.

487
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:14,708
You know what truth is?

488
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:16,700
The struggle could use
some more muscle.

489
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:18,350
Alright, look.
I'll tell you what.

490
00:28:18,450 --> 00:28:19,748
We bust the both
of you outta here,

491
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,702
but understand this,
from now on you work for me.

492
00:28:21,714 --> 00:28:24,050
- That's fine.
- Sounds like a fun challenge.

493
00:28:25,554 --> 00:28:26,422
Aah! oh!

494
00:28:26,452 --> 00:28:28,585
Alright, guys.
Let's do this.

495
00:28:29,491 --> 00:28:30,592
Aaah!

496
00:28:32,067 --> 00:28:35,289
- To the sewers!
- The sewers?

497
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,045
What are you waiting for?
I'm not playin'.

498
00:28:38,263 --> 00:28:41,505
I said, to the sewers!

499
00:28:48,534 --> 00:28:51,761
Long live the revolution, suckers!

500
00:28:56,324 --> 00:28:57,736
I can do it.

501
00:29:03,726 --> 00:29:04,893
Max!

502
00:29:05,851 --> 00:29:06,890
Max!

503
00:29:07,337 --> 00:29:09,337
Max! Max!

504
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:12,514
Max! Max! Max!

505
00:29:25,402 --> 00:29:27,402
Where are you, Max?

506
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:32,377
Looks like you could
use a little help.

507
00:29:32,377 --> 00:29:33,797
Who said that?

508
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,257
Over here!

509
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,148
In this dark and forbidding shed.

510
00:29:46,130 --> 00:29:48,656
Uh... Hello?

511
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:50,920
I can see from miles.

512
00:29:51,023 --> 00:29:53,964
If you let me out,
I'll find your friend.

513
00:29:54,077 --> 00:29:57,613
Wow! Really!
Aww! You're so sweet!

514
00:29:57,692 --> 00:29:59,715
You're sweet, too.

515
00:29:59,715 --> 00:30:01,710
Ooh! Thanks stranger.

516
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:06,943
But not so sweet, there's also
a salty, gainly thing going on.

517
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:08,157
Yeah, that's me.

518
00:30:08,616 --> 00:30:10,480
Come on, let's get you
outta that shed

519
00:30:11,713 --> 00:30:15,221
Yeah, that's it. Just step over
the pile of bones.

520
00:30:15,321 --> 00:30:17,668
Pile of bones.
Okay, well do.

521
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,272
I sure hope Max is safe.

522
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:22,488
You're a very thoughtful food.

523
00:30:22,506 --> 00:30:25,360
Food? I didn't say that.
I said friend.

524
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:29,539
I meant food, Fri... Friend.
You know what I meant.

525
00:30:29,639 --> 00:30:32,448
I'm sure lucky I found you...
Uh...

526
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,662
Tiberius.

527
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,151
And yes, this is a very good
thing for you.

528
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,568
This whole meeting me thing.

529
00:30:38,924 --> 00:30:40,595
Take off my hood.

530
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,004
Ha!

531
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:48,190
Aahh!

532
00:30:50,462 --> 00:30:51,700
Aaahhh!

533
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:55,400
Ow! The chain!

534
00:30:56,346 --> 00:30:58,862
Oh, you tried to eat me!

535
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,017
I'm sorry!

536
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,635
You should be sorry!
You deserve to be locked up!

537
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:05,271
You're a bad, bad bird!

538
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:08,426
I can't help it!
I was born with killer instincts!

539
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:10,160
That is just no excuse!

540
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,960
You're right, even for a predator
I'm selfish.

541
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,004
I'm selfish predator.

542
00:31:15,357 --> 00:31:18,627
It's no wonder
I have no friends. Nobody.

543
00:31:19,361 --> 00:31:21,630
I... I... This is hopeless. I...

544
00:31:21,653 --> 00:31:24,613
Oh, don't.
There is no need to cry.

545
00:31:24,622 --> 00:31:26,764
I'm sorry that I yalled
at you before.

546
00:31:26,773 --> 00:31:28,537
Please take off the chain.

547
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:31,395
This time I'll help you,
I promise.

548
00:31:32,136 --> 00:31:36,484
Tiberius, this is gonna sound
completely horrible, but um...

549
00:31:36,915 --> 00:31:38,880
I don't fully trust you.

550
00:31:41,511 --> 00:31:43,018
Oh! No, no, but...

551
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,164
I guess everyone deserves
a second chance,

552
00:31:45,173 --> 00:31:47,226
And you are just a lonely
old bird,

553
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,551
And you do have weird manners,

554
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,004
because you live in
a weird shed on a roof.

555
00:31:51,022 --> 00:31:54,440
So, I'll tell you what,
if you find Max...

556
00:31:54,817 --> 00:31:56,465
I'll be your best friend!

557
00:31:56,465 --> 00:31:58,460
Best friend?

558
00:31:58,702 --> 00:32:00,130
You and me?

559
00:32:01,637 --> 00:32:03,539
Whoo-ooh!

560
00:32:06,175 --> 00:32:07,409
Awww!

561
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:11,246
Whoo-ooh!

562
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:16,850
Yaah!

563
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:21,982
Yes! That sounds nice.
Let's do this.

564
00:32:21,982 --> 00:32:23,192
Okay.

565
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,311
So, what does this Max look like?

566
00:32:32,311 --> 00:32:34,803
Brown and white,
he's a short hair,

567
00:32:34,817 --> 00:32:38,400
roguishly handsome,
he's got a sparkle in his eye.

568
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:39,946
He sounds dreamy.

569
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:42,711
Ohh! You have no idea.

570
00:32:42,728 --> 00:32:45,450
I mean, what! Whatever!
Shut up. Pfff!

571
00:32:47,777 --> 00:32:49,184
If my owner comes,

572
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:51,680
put on the hood
and pretend to be me.

573
00:32:51,706 --> 00:32:53,395
Okay, thank you!

574
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,570
Ugh! The smell is disgusting...
ly good!

575
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:11,470
This is also great.
We love it here.

576
00:33:19,548 --> 00:33:20,382
Huh!

577
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:24,240
What's the password?

578
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,715
Password?

579
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,120
Look, look at me.
I am your leader.

580
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,927
The leader does not
decide the password.

581
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,008
The leader makes up
the password, idiots!

582
00:33:34,008 --> 00:33:36,131
Everybody, I'm making up
a new password, right now.

583
00:33:36,142 --> 00:33:40,402
The new password, is don't ask
the leader for the password!

584
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,850
Follow me.

585
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:54,177
Welcome to The Underbelly, brothers.

586
00:33:54,417 --> 00:33:56,906
Home of the flushed pets.

587
00:34:19,448 --> 00:34:21,253
Brothers and sisters,

588
00:34:21,271 --> 00:34:25,342
as you see, I've return from
the surface with two new recruits.

589
00:34:25,351 --> 00:34:27,840
These guys are owner killers.

590
00:34:28,317 --> 00:34:29,251
Yay!

591
00:34:29,271 --> 00:34:32,070
Hey! Hey!
Settle it down!

592
00:34:32,586 --> 00:34:35,208
Guys! I want you to tell 'em
how you did it.

593
00:34:35,368 --> 00:34:38,222
Go ahead, tell 'em the whole story
about how you took out your owner.

594
00:34:38,231 --> 00:34:41,084
Don't leave out nothing.
We love gory detail here.

595
00:34:41,084 --> 00:34:42,698
- Oh yeah!
- Tell us!

596
00:34:42,711 --> 00:34:44,320
- Right.
- So, tell 'em, Max.

597
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,115
Okay, okay. So...

598
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,555
- I was like...
- Well, we were like...

599
00:34:47,573 --> 00:34:49,970
- Take that, stupid owner.
- Yeah.

600
00:34:50,337 --> 00:34:52,810
So, that's...
That who you're dealing with.

601
00:34:54,168 --> 00:34:55,844
Hey, that's story bored me
to death.

602
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:57,173
Boring!

603
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,613
Give us detail.

604
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:00,302
Okay. Max?

605
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,284
Okay, Well... Uh...

606
00:35:02,284 --> 00:35:04,353
So, there's this...
There's this thing in the kitchen.

607
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:05,360
Yeah, table.

608
00:35:05,377 --> 00:35:06,986
- It's like flat...
- Toaster.

609
00:35:07,004 --> 00:35:09,091
And then, round on
just the end of it.

610
00:35:09,091 --> 00:35:10,092
A spoon?

611
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:11,768
- Yes, a spoon!
- Exactly.

612
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,671
You can't hurt someone
with a spoon.

613
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:15,617
You scoop with a spoon.

614
00:35:15,786 --> 00:35:18,106
How many people wanna know
how to kill somebody with a spoon?

615
00:35:18,311 --> 00:35:19,900
- I do!
- Oh yeah!

616
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,360
Okay.
Well, we use a spoon...

617
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,440
Hit the button on this machine...

618
00:35:25,457 --> 00:35:26,450
- Right, right.
- on the counter.

619
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,044
- And it's go those...
- The... You know...

620
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,431
- Those blades.
- It's got blades!

621
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:32,000
Was it a blender? Whaoh!

622
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
You blending somebody?

623
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:36,051
He's talk about the blender, guys.

624
00:35:36,051 --> 00:35:37,618
Oh, please!
Tell me it was a blender.

625
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,840
Hey, buddy.
I don't ask what it's call,

626
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,990
- We just kill with it.
- But, it was a blender.

627
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,920
Wow! Do ya'll hear this?

628
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:45,861
You know who's like this?

629
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:48,597
Ricky! Rest in peace.

630
00:35:48,995 --> 00:35:51,368
Ricky was the only
soldier I had...

631
00:35:51,368 --> 00:35:53,360
that was ready to kill
humans on sight.

632
00:35:54,008 --> 00:35:55,704
Everybody else need a pet talk.

633
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:57,448
Not these two brothers.

634
00:35:57,466 --> 00:35:59,630
Whoa-hoo! Yay!

635
00:35:59,946 --> 00:36:04,220
See, all of us have suffered
at the hands of man.

636
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:05,847
I mean, take me for instance.

637
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:08,316
I was a magician's rabbit
for kids parties.

638
00:36:08,648 --> 00:36:11,460
But then, bunny tricks
went out of style.

639
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,737
So, what did my owner do?

640
00:36:12,730 --> 00:36:15,004
My owner went and left
magic behind,

641
00:36:15,004 --> 00:36:16,435
And made me disappear...

642
00:36:16,435 --> 00:36:18,435
From his life!

643
00:36:18,727 --> 00:36:19,594
Uh-huh.

644
00:36:19,608 --> 00:36:21,608
I lived in a tattoo parlor.

645
00:36:21,608 --> 00:36:24,299
The trainees used to practice
on me.

646
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:26,501
Until they ran outta space!

647
00:36:27,594 --> 00:36:29,741
I mean, yes.
Human say they love us,

648
00:36:29,841 --> 00:36:32,287
But then, they turn around
and throw us out like garbage.

649
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,130
Ain't that right, Seamonkeys?

650
00:36:34,435 --> 00:36:37,128
Hey! It's not our fault
we don't look like the ad.

651
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:38,226
Yeah.

652
00:36:38,226 --> 00:36:41,683
Alright, you guys are joining
The Brotherhood.

653
00:36:41,683 --> 00:36:43,606
It's initiation time.

654
00:36:43,852 --> 00:36:45,487
- What?
- I'm sorry, what time?

655
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:48,026
Summon the Viper!

656
00:36:51,022 --> 00:36:52,790
Is this Viper poisonous?

657
00:36:52,794 --> 00:36:55,464
Because I should warning you
I'm very allergic to poison!

658
00:37:02,524 --> 00:37:05,020
Ouch! Ah!

659
00:37:05,315 --> 00:37:07,210
Alright, show her.

660
00:37:12,906 --> 00:37:15,851
Huh! Max's collar!
Where is he?

661
00:37:15,851 --> 00:37:17,919
Wha... Wha...
What happened to him?

662
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,608
Oi, I ain't say nothing.

663
00:37:20,417 --> 00:37:24,520
You're gonna tell us where Max is,
and you're gonna tell us now!

664
00:37:26,168 --> 00:37:28,630
Is this supposed to scare me?
I'm a cat.

665
00:37:28,648 --> 00:37:31,022
- I'll end on my feet.
- Does it always happen?

666
00:37:31,031 --> 00:37:33,706
'Cause your head looks like
it's taken a lot of landings.

667
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:35,036
Do you want me to catch you?

668
00:37:35,036 --> 00:37:37,572
'Cause I'll catch you this way,
and let you look like a waffle.

669
00:37:38,737 --> 00:37:42,400
Okay, he's too stupid to talk
and too ugly to eat.

670
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,285
Aahhh!

671
00:37:43,502 --> 00:37:45,786
I'm done playing nice!

672
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,426
Where is Max?!

673
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,337
- Oh!
- Tell me!

674
00:37:50,337 --> 00:37:51,319
What? Aw!

675
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,666
I ju... I can't...
Aww!

676
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:55,591
Let me finish... Aww!
Help me!

677
00:37:55,593 --> 00:37:57,792
Don't look at him,
look at me!

678
00:37:57,792 --> 00:37:59,861
Nobody can help you!

679
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:02,330
Where is Max?!

680
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:04,666
Okay! Okay!
He's in the sewers.

681
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:07,260
He got taken.
Please, have mercy!

682
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:08,970
Adorable buffy dog.

683
00:38:08,970 --> 00:38:09,715
Huh!

684
00:38:09,902 --> 00:38:13,141
Snake bite! Snake bite!
Snake bite!

685
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,431
Snake bite! Snake bite!

686
00:38:15,443 --> 00:38:18,813
Snake bite! Snake bite!
Snake bite!

687
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:21,049
Snake bite! Snake bite!

688
00:38:23,652 --> 00:38:24,619
Aww!

689
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,640
As proof of your allegiance,

690
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:29,591
You're now receve the bite
of a one fang...

691
00:38:29,608 --> 00:38:31,493
half-blind Viper,

692
00:38:31,493 --> 00:38:36,431
fueled by a diet of
anti human rage!

693
00:38:56,177 --> 00:38:57,580
Who wants to go first?

694
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,222
Uh... Yeah.
Hey, here's the thing, tho.

695
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,973
- I mean, It's...
- Tiny dog.

696
00:39:02,693 --> 00:39:04,225
Can I call you, tiny dog?

697
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:06,115
It fits you.
Let's admit that.

698
00:39:06,231 --> 00:39:07,195
Mate, look.

699
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,875
Between you and the fat dog?
I like you the best.

700
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:11,004
Oh, thank you.

701
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,933
Tiny dog is gonna fo first.
Everybody, T.D is going first.

702
00:39:14,951 --> 00:39:15,937
No, no, no!

703
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:18,840
Tiny dog does not wannago first,
take the fat dog.

704
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,208
Aww! Aahh!

705
00:39:20,208 --> 00:39:22,200
- No, no, no! Stop!
- Snake bite! Snake bite!

706
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,880
Snake bite! Snake bite!
Snake bite! Snake bite!

707
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,880
No, no, no, no!

708
00:39:30,497 --> 00:39:34,053
What are you doing,
initiating a couple of domestics?

709
00:39:34,071 --> 00:39:35,013
Domestics?

710
00:39:35,031 --> 00:39:37,058
Yeah, we just dumped
those two in the alley,

711
00:39:37,058 --> 00:39:38,760
Slashed two of their collars.

712
00:39:38,968 --> 00:39:40,820
No, no, no.
That.. That's not true.

713
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,163
You said, you burned your collars.

714
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,137
Well, burned, lost,
had 'em stolen by a cat.

715
00:39:45,155 --> 00:39:47,530
It's all just word.
Really? Isn't it?

716
00:39:47,688 --> 00:39:50,150
You don't deserve to be
marked by a Viper.

717
00:39:50,168 --> 00:39:52,071
- Oh, wow!
- We'll just show ourselves out.

718
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:55,288
You deserve to be eaten
by the Viper.

719
00:39:55,502 --> 00:39:57,466
Het those leash lovers!

720
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,080
Aahhh!

721
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:04,608
Hold on!

722
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:14,041
Go get 'em, Duke!

723
00:40:14,062 --> 00:40:14,933
Whoa!

724
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:54,003
Uhh. Fellas, that was an accident

725
00:40:54,103 --> 00:40:57,461
You squished the sacred Viper?

726
00:40:58,054 --> 00:41:01,302
He's a flapjack!
Oh, Viper.

727
00:41:01,864 --> 00:41:05,450
Viper, you in a better place.
You and Ricky.

728
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,556
You ain't never did
nothing to nobody.

729
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,400
Well, you bit a lot of people, Viper.

730
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,330
So technically, you might
actually deserve this.

731
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:18,862
This might be something
that was long overdue.

732
00:41:18,862 --> 00:41:19,537
But...

733
00:41:19,537 --> 00:41:22,460
It shouldn't came like this.
Not on my watch.

734
00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:24,382
Get 'em!

735
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:27,569
Whoah!

736
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:29,284
Come on!

737
00:41:46,862 --> 00:41:49,010
Aw! Wait on, Duke!

738
00:41:52,961 --> 00:41:55,953
We're sorry.
Can this be over, now?

739
00:41:56,631 --> 00:41:57,799
We've got a problem!

740
00:41:57,799 --> 00:41:59,271
We have so many problems.

741
00:41:59,271 --> 00:42:01,990
Which one do you mean it,
this moment?

742
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,973
Stop running, dummies!
Stop it, right there!

743
00:42:09,982 --> 00:42:12,470
- Hold your breathe!
- Hold my breathe?

744
00:42:22,724 --> 00:42:26,194
This is my least favorite party
this holding so far.

745
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:46,214
Friends. I'm afraid that I have
some terrible news.

746
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:48,416
The squirrels are gonna
take over the world!

747
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:49,457
I knew it!

748
00:42:49,466 --> 00:42:52,595
I always said, squirrels are little
shifty, little guys.

749
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,791
No! We're not doing
this squirrel thing, right now.

750
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,290
That's not... No!

751
00:42:56,693 --> 00:43:00,328
Max is missing!
He's out there, somewhere.

752
00:43:00,337 --> 00:43:03,937
Lost, scared,
so, so handsome.

753
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:06,533
We've got to find him
and bring him home!

754
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:09,902
But, the outside world is loud
and scary... Whoa!

755
00:43:09,911 --> 00:43:11,020
Is that a hawk?

756
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,630
This is my friend, Tiberius.
He's going to help us.

757
00:43:14,648 --> 00:43:17,440
He's not going to eat us.
We've already been over it.

758
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,582
Come on, Gidget.
We go out there without a leash?

759
00:43:19,591 --> 00:43:22,533
We'll get caught by a net.
Or something worse.

760
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:24,240
Yeah, like a hawk!

761
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,093
We're wasting time!
Max needs us!

762
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,813
Come on, girl. Max doesn't even
know you're alive.

763
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:33,813
Well, I don't care. I love him,
I love him with all my heart.

764
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:37,057
And, I'm gonna go look for Max
no matter who's with me.

765
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:38,390
So...

766
00:43:38,648 --> 00:43:40,390
Who's with me?

767
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,510
Alright.
Fine, fine.

768
00:43:48,568 --> 00:43:52,120
Oh, come on, guys.
I can't believe you.

769
00:43:52,711 --> 00:43:55,084
When I got my claws
caught in the curtains,

770
00:43:55,084 --> 00:43:56,749
Who pulled me down?

771
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:58,400
Max, did!

772
00:43:58,942 --> 00:44:01,760
Buddy, Mile!
When you were fixed,

773
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,831
Who told you to sit
the comfortable way?

774
00:44:03,848 --> 00:44:06,160
- Max, did.
- Max, did!

775
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:07,580
Max, did! He did it!

776
00:44:07,884 --> 00:44:10,924
And, when that random cat
tried to eat Sweet Pea,

777
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,675
Who saved him?

778
00:44:12,693 --> 00:44:15,040
It wasn't a random cat,
it was you!

779
00:44:15,377 --> 00:44:17,644
The identity of the random cat
is not the point,

780
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,106
We're talking about
who saved him?

781
00:44:20,124 --> 00:44:21,048
Max, did!

782
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,062
We gotta sive him.
We gotta go save Max!

783
00:44:25,351 --> 00:44:28,311
Yeah! Let's go save Max!

784
00:44:28,471 --> 00:44:31,066
Uhh...
Which one is Max, again?

785
00:44:32,550 --> 00:44:34,720
- Hmmm.
- Tiberius!

786
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:36,800
No! Bad, bad bird!

787
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:41,831
Nice little guy.
Nice little guy.

788
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:43,531
I like this, bird.

789
00:44:43,848 --> 00:44:45,530
Crazy bird.

790
00:45:11,217 --> 00:45:12,960
Aahhh!

791
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:16,631
Ohh!

792
00:45:17,351 --> 00:45:19,866
Come on, we gotta get to shore.

793
00:45:19,893 --> 00:45:23,370
I only do the doggie paddle.
And I don't know it well.

794
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:26,470
Swim, tiny dog. Swim!

795
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,653
Aww!

796
00:45:36,718 --> 00:45:37,752
Duke!

797
00:45:41,084 --> 00:45:42,453
Help!

798
00:45:48,053 --> 00:45:49,910
Max, grab the ring!

799
00:45:50,391 --> 00:45:51,777
I ca... I can't!

800
00:45:51,777 --> 00:45:53,768
Keep it up, Max!
You're doing...

801
00:45:53,786 --> 00:45:56,008
Well, you're not...
You're not doing great.

802
00:45:56,008 --> 00:45:58,239
But, you're not drowning,
and that's something.

803
00:45:58,239 --> 00:45:59,907
Ah! Aww!

804
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,182
You're almost there!

805
00:46:07,191 --> 00:46:08,275
Whoah!

806
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,217
Huh!

807
00:46:16,577 --> 00:46:17,520
Ahh!

808
00:46:19,994 --> 00:46:20,828
Uh!

809
00:46:21,014 --> 00:46:23,931
- Thanks, Duke.
- No problem.

810
00:46:24,257 --> 00:46:26,730
Finally, we're going home.

811
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:30,530
Uh...
Isn't home that way?

812
00:46:31,093 --> 00:46:33,560
Uhh! Seriously?

813
00:46:43,850 --> 00:46:45,271
They're going to Brooklyn.

814
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,017
They say, everyone's
going to Brooklyn these days.

815
00:46:48,035 --> 00:46:49,624
It's makin' a real comeback.

816
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:52,053
I'm not talking about hipster
real estate trends.

817
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:54,459
I'm talking about vengeance, Tattoo!

818
00:46:54,559 --> 00:46:56,864
Death is coming to Brooklyn.

819
00:46:56,864 --> 00:47:00,168
And it's got buck teeth,
and a cottontail!

820
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:20,529
Let's go.

821
00:47:35,670 --> 00:47:36,938
Weee!

822
00:47:39,083 --> 00:47:41,946
- Hey, how are you?
- Hi, how are you?

823
00:47:42,046 --> 00:47:43,410
Enchanté.

824
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:46,231
Chuck! Chuck! Chuck!
Chuck! Chuck!

825
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,377
Chuck! Chuck!

826
00:47:47,395 --> 00:47:48,740
Yay!!

827
00:48:00,110 --> 00:48:02,506
What is this creepy joint?

828
00:48:02,950 --> 00:48:04,080
This is Pops place.

829
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:07,182
His owner is never home
so, it's kind of a hotspot.

830
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,617
Pops knows everyone in this city.

831
00:48:09,626 --> 00:48:13,048
If he agrees to help us.
Max is as good as found.

832
00:48:13,066 --> 00:48:15,240
- Cool!
- Oh, fabulous.

833
00:48:48,737 --> 00:48:51,768
- Tell me you got that.
- Oh, have yes I did.

834
00:48:51,786 --> 00:48:53,733
- What's up, Peanut?
- Hey, Buddy.

835
00:48:53,742 --> 00:48:56,900
- You see Pops around here?
- Yeah, he's over there.

836
00:48:58,412 --> 00:48:59,512
Hey, Pops.

837
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:01,733
- Mushroom and sweet potatos.
- Pops!

838
00:49:01,742 --> 00:49:03,890
Owee! Guys!
Who's that? What?

839
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,440
Oh! Hey, Buddy.

840
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:09,033
How you've been, old timer?

841
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:10,924
Paralysed.

842
00:49:12,091 --> 00:49:15,664
Great. Listen mr. Pops.
Our friend Max was taken.

843
00:49:15,764 --> 00:49:18,227
Last we heard,
he was lost in the sewers.

844
00:49:18,327 --> 00:49:21,540
Buddy said that maybe
you could help us?

845
00:49:21,696 --> 00:49:25,046
No, I do know a guy
in the sewers, but...

846
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,617
I... I don't go out anymore.

847
00:49:27,870 --> 00:49:29,520
Uh. What a waste of time.

848
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:30,899
Who said that?

849
00:49:30,899 --> 00:49:33,697
Oh! I said it.
By the way, I meant no offence.

850
00:49:33,790 --> 00:49:35,644
I just...
Have you seen yourself?

851
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,395
Welldy, well, well, well.

852
00:49:37,404 --> 00:49:39,927
Looky what we apparently
have here!

853
00:49:39,927 --> 00:49:42,930
Me see would like
to have a look see.

854
00:49:43,066 --> 00:49:45,013
Myron, brows!

855
00:49:47,465 --> 00:49:48,502
Oh, no.

856
00:49:48,502 --> 00:49:52,206
Oh, yes.
Me like what me see.

857
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:56,210
Well, what me can see,
it's only an an attractive blur.

858
00:49:56,613 --> 00:50:00,370
Little lady, this is my city.
I'll find your friend.

859
00:50:00,477 --> 00:50:02,850
Alright, party is over.

860
00:50:02,850 --> 00:50:04,850
Myron, vacuum!

861
00:50:09,909 --> 00:50:12,842
So, where are you from,
my fuzzy angel?

862
00:50:12,982 --> 00:50:14,729
Dude, I'm a cat.

863
00:50:14,729 --> 00:50:16,720
Well, nobody is perfect.

864
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,585
I'm so hungry.

865
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:33,799
Oh man, would you
look at that sandwich!

866
00:50:33,971 --> 00:50:36,474
Alright, time to work the gift.

867
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:46,629
No, no, no!

868
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,120
Argh!

869
00:50:50,871 --> 00:50:53,813
Okay. This... This...
This will be fine. We're fine.

870
00:50:53,822 --> 00:50:55,360
We can find our way home.

871
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,804
We're descended from
the mighty wolf.

872
00:50:57,830 --> 00:51:00,035
We've raw primal instincts...

873
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:03,177
that are mere moments away
from kicking in...

874
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:04,657
And leading us home.

875
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:08,010
I can not wait!
Here it comes...

876
00:51:09,413 --> 00:51:11,493
- Anything?
- No.

877
00:51:11,493 --> 00:51:13,120
Wait! Aw! I...

878
00:51:13,617 --> 00:51:15,660
Argh! No!

879
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,644
I don't know, Duke.

880
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:21,324
Maybe the legend of dogs
coming from wolves is just wrong.

881
00:51:21,333 --> 00:51:23,531
I mean like, maybe one puppy
asks his mom,

882
00:51:23,555 --> 00:51:26,026
"Where did we come from?"
and the mom said, "Woof"!

883
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,884
And the kid was like,
"Oh, wolves"!

884
00:51:27,890 --> 00:51:29,484
And she's like, "Yeah, fine".

885
00:51:29,484 --> 00:51:31,480
- Sausage!
- Huh?

886
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,271
Do you smell that?

887
00:51:33,690 --> 00:51:37,113
- Oh, man. It is!
- Sausage!

888
00:51:37,279 --> 00:51:39,347
Well then,
what are we waiting for?

889
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:41,340
We're coming for you, baby!

890
00:51:54,497 --> 00:51:56,910
Lower the ramp, dummy!

891
00:51:57,490 --> 00:51:58,834
Who are they?

892
00:51:59,090 --> 00:52:03,037
This is Puffball, Squashface,
Wiener Dog,

893
00:52:03,048 --> 00:52:06,702
Yellow Bird, Eagle Eye,
Guinea Pig Joe!

894
00:52:06,711 --> 00:52:08,843
And of course
my girlfriend ,Ronda!

895
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:11,278
Ah! 100% percent wrong.

896
00:52:12,351 --> 00:52:13,944
Good enough.

897
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:17,608
Come on, let's go!
Move it or lose it.

898
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:22,444
Every bird instinct I have says,
"Don't follow a dog on wheels".

899
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:24,364
Um... Mr. Pops.
Sir...

900
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:26,737
Shouldn't we be
heading to the sewers?

901
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:28,417
Now, if we take the human road,

902
00:52:28,426 --> 00:52:30,000
getting there is gonna
take days.

903
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,528
You may have lot of time,

904
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,688
but for me, every breath
is a cliffhanger!

905
00:52:33,706 --> 00:52:36,870
So, we gotta take
the secret route.

906
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:41,320
Okay! The secret route was death.

907
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:44,148
- Well, that's that, I guess.
- Come on!

908
00:52:46,595 --> 00:52:48,280
Get down here.

909
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:54,124
Sweet Pea.

910
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,270
Keep moving.

911
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:19,630
Oh, no!

912
00:53:22,422 --> 00:53:24,774
Stop it!
Look away!

913
00:54:07,428 --> 00:54:09,865
Come on, I don't have all day.

914
00:54:37,759 --> 00:54:39,653
Come on, slowpokes

915
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,635
What is that smell?

916
00:54:41,857 --> 00:54:44,257
It's poo-poo
with a dash of caca.

917
00:54:46,030 --> 00:54:47,920
Scent is getting stronger.

918
00:54:51,272 --> 00:54:52,339
Aww!

919
00:54:53,882 --> 00:54:55,266
Oh, man!

920
00:55:00,791 --> 00:55:02,897
Duke, let's eat!

921
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:04,497
Oh, yes!

922
00:55:13,991 --> 00:55:16,337
Oh, smells so good!

923
00:55:17,631 --> 00:55:19,967
Oh, yeah!

924
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,808
- Sausages!
- Sausages!

925
00:55:52,613 --> 00:55:54,710
Come on, boys!

926
00:55:59,306 --> 00:56:01,875
Holy Schnitzel!

927
00:56:04,570 --> 00:56:06,311
"We go together,

928
00:56:06,328 --> 00:56:08,910
"Like rama lamma lamma
ka dinga da dinga dong."

929
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:10,613

00:56:10,610 --> 00:56:13,315

931
00:56:13,310 --> 00:56:15,520
"Chang chang

932
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:19,324
"That's the way it should be."

933
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:21,573
"Wha-oohh, yeah!"

934
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,635
"We're for each other,

935
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:26,266
"Like a wop ba-ba lu-bop
and wop bam boom".

936
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:27,991
"Just like my brother is,

937
00:56:27,991 --> 00:56:30,637

939
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:36,586
"We'll always be together,

940
00:56:36,586 --> 00:56:38,979
"Wha-oohh, yeah!"

941
00:56:38,970 --> 00:56:47,421
"We'll always be together".

942
00:56:47,421 --> 00:56:49,790
"We'll always..."

943
00:56:55,395 --> 00:56:57,630
You get in a wierd pipe, man.

944
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,817
Alright, now these guys are
a bit testy.

945
00:57:02,844 --> 00:57:04,660
So, just let me do the talking.

946
00:57:04,862 --> 00:57:08,439
Hey, you cry baby!
Where is the Viper at?

947
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:19,902
Don't you worry, Viper!
You will not be forgotten!

948
00:57:21,137 --> 00:57:23,690
You will be avenged, Viper!

949
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:26,622
And if you don't believe me,

950
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,204
You can look at my battle plans.
It's all laid out, right here!

951
00:57:32,515 --> 00:57:35,511
Boss. I can't tell thogh what it is.

952
00:57:35,733 --> 00:57:38,000
Well, you have to really
look at it to understand it.

953
00:57:38,026 --> 00:57:40,302
Like, that's you guys
right here. And...

954
00:57:40,302 --> 00:57:41,448
See, that's Brooklyn.

955
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:43,662
That's where we go
get 'em dogs.

956
00:57:43,662 --> 00:57:45,379
Bam! Bam!

957
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:51,537
That ball of fluff's got
a screw loose. Let's get at 'em.

958
00:57:51,555 --> 00:57:53,320
<i>But, you get it.
You see what I'm sayin'.</i>

959
00:57:53,697 --> 00:57:56,355
Bottom line is, I'm coming
right to you, Tiny Dog.

960
00:57:56,364 --> 00:57:59,360
And that big fat brown dog,
he gonna get it, too.

961
00:57:59,377 --> 00:58:00,444
Tiny Dog?

962
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,133
There're lots of tiny dogs
in the city!

963
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:05,075
I mean, you're a tiny dog, okay?
So, let's just go.

964
00:58:05,070 --> 00:58:09,297
He also said, big fat brown dog.
Like Max's new roommate.

965
00:58:09,315 --> 00:58:10,613
Not necessarily.

966
00:58:10,613 --> 00:58:13,907
Whoo! Max! Max!
Max! Max! Max!

967
00:58:13,911 --> 00:58:15,720
You are gonna get it!

968
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:18,412
Ahh! That's kinda hard
to hard to dispute.

969
00:58:18,471 --> 00:58:20,951
Hey! You stay away from...

970
00:58:21,608 --> 00:58:23,840
Wait, what?
You know, Tiny Dog?

971
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,820
He's my friend!

972
00:58:26,820 --> 00:58:28,820
And some might say
my boyfriend!

973
00:58:28,853 --> 00:58:30,640
Uhh...
Nobody says that.

974
00:58:30,782 --> 00:58:32,460
I can't beleive you know, Tiny Dog.

975
00:58:32,569 --> 00:58:34,294
Oh man, that's cool!
It's such a small world.

976
00:58:34,294 --> 00:58:36,096
That's the funny thing about it.

977
00:58:36,293 --> 00:58:38,500
- Get 'em!
- Scatter!

978
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:45,995
Not good.

979
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,475
See you guys, later.

980
00:58:51,490 --> 00:58:52,995
Oh my God!

981
00:58:56,454 --> 00:58:58,416
Everybody, run!

982
00:59:03,182 --> 00:59:06,350
Derick, you idiot!
Did they all get away?

983
00:59:08,142 --> 00:59:10,500
Hewo!
That was a close one.

984
00:59:11,617 --> 00:59:13,200
Oh, nuts!

985
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,422
Yes! We got one.

986
00:59:16,053 --> 00:59:17,850
Oh, good for you, guys!

987
00:59:17,850 --> 00:59:19,317
- Yay!
- Ya-hey!

988
00:59:19,310 --> 00:59:22,942
Oh yes, Tiny Dog!
We got your friend!

989
00:59:23,008 --> 00:59:24,747
Advantage me!

990
00:59:26,773 --> 00:59:27,781
Uh-oh!

991
00:59:27,781 --> 00:59:29,780
Just ignore
what just happend, okay?

992
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,733
Yes!

993
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:39,560
You know what?

994
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,088
I mean, this maybe
the sausage talking...

995
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:43,688
But, you're okay.

996
00:59:43,706 --> 00:59:45,999
Right back at you, man!

997
00:59:45,990 --> 00:59:48,080
You know, when I met you
I was all like...

998
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:50,533
"Oh! I don't know if I like him".

999
00:59:50,530 --> 00:59:52,862
But, now that I know you,
I'm like...

1000
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:54,820
"I like him".

1001
00:59:56,521 --> 01:00:00,930
You know, I saw this place.
From the outside. Many times!

1002
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:05,546
And I know what treasures
are weighted within these walls.

1003
01:00:05,555 --> 01:00:09,020
I would've broke down that door
a long time ago, I tell you.

1004
01:00:09,142 --> 01:00:11,058
What are you talking about?

1005
01:00:11,058 --> 01:00:13,794
My old owner and I
used to live arond here.

1006
01:00:13,822 --> 01:00:17,197
Duke! Man, wait!
Did you used to have an owner?

1007
01:00:17,190 --> 01:00:20,053
Well, It was...
It was a long time ago.

1008
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,626
I don't wanna talk about it.

1009
01:00:21,626 --> 01:00:23,620
Yes, you do. Come on.

1010
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:25,733
I don't know.

1011
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:27,730
But, you know what?

1012
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,721
He was so cool.

1013
01:00:30,906 --> 01:00:32,124
Yeah?

1014
01:00:32,657 --> 01:00:35,928
Yeah. He was the best.

1015
01:00:48,924 --> 01:00:50,488
Man, we had fun!

1016
01:00:53,297 --> 01:00:55,200
We play fetch!

1017
01:01:00,862 --> 01:01:02,986
We go for walks.

1018
01:01:04,675 --> 01:01:06,440
We take naps.

1019
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,490
We're both big nappers.

1020
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,850
I got out one night,
chasing a butterfly or a car.

1021
01:01:27,244 --> 01:01:29,768
By the time, I'd caught up
with it and ate it!

1022
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,933
Probably a butterfly, then.

1023
01:01:30,950 --> 01:01:34,222
I realized I was so far away
from my home.

1024
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:35,680
I couldn't find it.

1025
01:01:36,222 --> 01:01:39,680
Few days later, I was picked up
by animal control.

1026
01:01:42,951 --> 01:01:45,952
I had a great thing going, but...

1027
01:01:46,257 --> 01:01:48,613
I had it go and mess it up.

1028
01:01:50,142 --> 01:01:52,133
Duke, we gotta
go to your house!

1029
01:01:52,130 --> 01:01:53,422
Na!

1030
01:01:53,431 --> 01:01:55,528
You know, your owner
is gonna relieved!

1031
01:01:55,528 --> 01:01:56,821
Really?

1032
01:01:57,031 --> 01:01:59,840
Yeah, but...
But, he never came for me.

1033
01:02:00,644 --> 01:02:01,900
Maybe he...

1034
01:02:02,961 --> 01:02:04,705
Maybe he didn't like me.

1035
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:07,974
Hey, of course he liked you.
he was your owner!

1036
01:02:07,991 --> 01:02:10,417
I mean, he's probably worried sick.

1037
01:02:10,826 --> 01:02:11,928
I don't know.

1038
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:14,081
Well, I do know
and we're going.

1039
01:02:14,081 --> 01:02:17,117
Your owner is gonna freak.
I'm freaking out just thinking about it!

1040
01:02:19,733 --> 01:02:22,450
Okay. Let's do it.

1041
01:02:22,915 --> 01:02:24,130
Here they are.

1042
01:02:24,604 --> 01:02:26,480
Alright, doggie, come on.

1043
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:28,951
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1044
01:02:28,960 --> 01:02:31,075
Hey! Where you think
you're going?

1045
01:02:31,075 --> 01:02:33,070
Come back here, you dogs!

1046
01:02:33,070 --> 01:02:35,070
Aahhh!

1047
01:02:44,631 --> 01:02:47,280
That rabbit.
He has crazy eyes.

1048
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,883
There ain't no curing
was wrong with that thing!

1049
01:02:49,893 --> 01:02:52,382
Gidget, here's an idea,

1050
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:56,613
Maybe there's a dog in
the neighborhood that looks like Max.

1051
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,560
Start hanging out with him,

1052
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:01,561
after a while you'll think it's him,
you'll be done.

1053
01:03:01,973 --> 01:03:03,813
We're not just giving up!

1054
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:05,665
We're dedicated, we're loyal,

1055
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:07,401
We're easly the greatest
pet ever,

1056
01:03:07,422 --> 01:03:08,728
We're dogs!

1057
01:03:08,737 --> 01:03:10,302
- Cat.
- Hawk.

1058
01:03:11,020 --> 01:03:13,173
Well, Congratulations,
today you're dogs

1059
01:03:13,173 --> 01:03:14,608
whether you like it or not.

1060
01:03:14,622 --> 01:03:15,813
Sweet!

1061
01:03:15,822 --> 01:03:18,545
Now, let's find Max
before that rabbit does.

1062
01:03:18,545 --> 01:03:20,714
Right! We're dogs!

1063
01:03:36,220 --> 01:03:38,364
Yep! They were here.

1064
01:03:38,382 --> 01:03:39,600
Excellent.

1065
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,951
We're closing in.

1066
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,591
This is a groundbreaking
evil behavior, people.

1067
01:03:43,848 --> 01:03:45,155
Groundbreaking.

1068
01:03:54,649 --> 01:03:56,750
Light pop just now
from my brain.

1069
01:03:56,888 --> 01:03:58,750
The bunny has an idea.

1070
01:04:02,007 --> 01:04:04,024
Okay.
So, how do I look?

1071
01:04:04,020 --> 01:04:05,271
You look great.

1072
01:04:06,524 --> 01:04:07,715
How do I smell?

1073
01:04:07,715 --> 01:04:10,530
Like a dog, Duke.
Relax, man.

1074
01:04:13,386 --> 01:04:14,815
There it is!

1075
01:04:18,184 --> 01:04:21,721
Well, go on up.
Go scratch that door.

1076
01:04:26,648 --> 01:04:29,890
Remember that sausage factory?
That was fun, huh?

1077
01:04:30,311 --> 01:04:31,840
Are you stalling?

1078
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,221
No, why do you think that?

1079
01:04:34,613 --> 01:04:37,333
Let's have a walk talk
about why you think I'm stalling.

1080
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:39,306
Duke, you have nothing
to be nervous about.

1081
01:04:39,306 --> 01:04:41,300
You're owner is gonna be
thrilled to see you.

1082
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:45,182
Okay.

1083
01:04:49,100 --> 01:04:51,813
Huh! That car's new!

1084
01:04:59,617 --> 01:05:01,220
Can I help you?

1085
01:05:03,751 --> 01:05:05,850
No, we're good, thanks.

1086
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:07,991
You're not good.
You look dirty.

1087
01:05:08,008 --> 01:05:10,391
And I'm gonna have to ask you
to get off my lawn

1088
01:05:10,391 --> 01:05:11,903
before I get... Um...

1089
01:05:12,186 --> 01:05:13,760
You know, what you have.

1090
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:15,760
This is my lawn!

1091
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:17,564
Duke, maybe we shoyld go.

1092
01:05:17,560 --> 01:05:20,373
And, why...
Why would Fred get a cat?

1093
01:05:20,391 --> 01:05:21,902
He hates cats.

1094
01:05:21,902 --> 01:05:23,900
It's one of things
I love about him.

1095
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,222
Fred? The old guy?

1096
01:05:26,755 --> 01:05:28,133
He... Um...

1097
01:05:29,457 --> 01:05:31,200
He died.

1098
01:05:32,790 --> 01:05:35,457
Duke, maybe I made a mistake
saying we should come here.

1099
01:05:35,475 --> 01:05:37,040
Let... Let's go.

1100
01:05:37,044 --> 01:05:40,620
You're a lair.
Max, cats lie all the time.

1101
01:05:41,128 --> 01:05:42,620
Don't faff for it!

1102
01:05:48,008 --> 01:05:49,330
Who are they?

1103
01:05:52,755 --> 01:05:55,560
Hey! This is my home!
Go away!

1104
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:02,657
Duke! It's time to go.

1105
01:06:04,364 --> 01:06:08,222
Duke, let's go, come on!
This isn't your home anymore.

1106
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:10,584
Why did you bring me here, Max?

1107
01:06:10,584 --> 01:06:12,852
Wait a minute.
This is my fault?

1108
01:06:12,871 --> 01:06:14,346
You know, I was trying
to help you!

1109
01:06:14,340 --> 01:06:17,022
You were trying
to get rid of me!

1110
01:06:18,035 --> 01:06:20,195
Yeah, you know what, Duke?
I don't need this.

1111
01:06:20,195 --> 01:06:22,190
Um... See you later.

1112
01:06:23,743 --> 01:06:25,738
Whoa! Whoa!
Come on, settle down!

1113
01:06:28,897 --> 01:06:30,480
Go home, Max!

1114
01:06:31,848 --> 01:06:33,582
Hey! Help me out here!

1115
01:06:33,582 --> 01:06:35,580
Hold on, I'm coming!

1116
01:06:36,426 --> 01:06:37,580
Let's move!

1117
01:06:38,555 --> 01:06:40,347
Finally get you, big fella.

1118
01:06:40,347 --> 01:06:41,348
Whoa! Come on!

1119
01:06:41,688 --> 01:06:43,340
This is it for you!

1120
01:06:50,133 --> 01:06:51,220
Duke!

1121
01:07:32,769 --> 01:07:34,017
Tiny Dog!

1122
01:07:36,260 --> 01:07:38,142
Oh! Are you kidding me?

1123
01:07:38,672 --> 01:07:40,740
You thought this was over, Tiny Dog?

1124
01:07:52,231 --> 01:07:54,604
Jab! Jab! Jab!
Body blow! Body blow!

1125
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:56,970
- Karate chop to your neck!
- Would you...

1126
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:00,131
Would you get off me?

1127
01:08:01,761 --> 01:08:02,629
Tattoo!

1128
01:08:05,217 --> 01:08:07,600
No, no, no, no!

1129
01:08:12,761 --> 01:08:16,209
Oh, T.D.
This kills me to say,

1130
01:08:16,209 --> 01:08:18,200
But, we gotta join forces, man!

1131
01:08:31,013 --> 01:08:33,193
We make a great team,
Tiny Dog!

1132
01:08:33,193 --> 01:08:35,528
Well, mainly I'm doing
all the hard work.

1133
01:08:35,520 --> 01:08:36,595
But you're helping.

1134
01:08:36,622 --> 01:08:38,764
Yes, yes. Fine.
Just keep your eyes on the road.

1135
01:08:38,760 --> 01:08:40,604
You're driving like an animal!

1136
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:45,111
What was that?

1137
01:08:45,111 --> 01:08:46,444
Oh, that was a pothole.

1138
01:08:46,440 --> 01:08:48,302
You're hitting things on purpose?

1139
01:08:48,346 --> 01:08:50,657
You know, you know me, too L.T.D.

1140
01:08:50,731 --> 01:08:52,812
Always keeping me in check.

1141
01:09:00,453 --> 01:09:01,635
Do you see the van?

1142
01:09:01,635 --> 01:09:04,290
Yeah, I see it.
We're about to hit it.

1143
01:09:30,008 --> 01:09:31,902
Relax Snowball, I got you.

1144
01:09:31,902 --> 01:09:33,524
There he is!

1145
01:09:33,524 --> 01:09:35,756
He's got Snowball!

1146
01:09:52,373 --> 01:09:55,706
Look, fellas.
This is not what it looks like.

1147
01:09:55,700 --> 01:09:57,306
shhh you!

1148
01:09:58,791 --> 01:10:00,960
You are gonna eat the boss!

1149
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:03,244
No, no, no. Snowball and I
are the same side, now!

1150
01:10:03,262 --> 01:10:05,290
Can you tell 'em, Snowball?
Tell them!

1151
01:10:05,591 --> 01:10:09,350
That raccoon is lying.
He's not the president.

1152
01:10:11,191 --> 01:10:13,660
Uh... I... I...

1153
01:10:14,071 --> 01:10:15,160
I...

1154
01:10:15,493 --> 01:10:17,022
Come on, now.

1155
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:29,142
Gidget!

1156
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:05,812
Go, Max!

1157
01:11:05,812 --> 01:11:09,015
Right! Okay, I gotta go.
Thank you! Thank you!

1158
01:11:10,423 --> 01:11:12,186
Stay down!

1159
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:28,101

1160
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,371

01:12:21,559 --> 01:12:22,989
Come on! Come on!

1165
01:12:23,422 --> 01:12:24,675
I got 'em!

1166
01:12:28,373 --> 01:12:29,560
Max!

1167
01:13:03,770 --> 01:13:06,640
Remember me!

1168
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:01,768
I feel heroic and handsome!

1169
01:14:02,094 --> 01:14:05,452
A ittle wet, but
I still look good! I look good!

1170
01:14:11,064 --> 01:14:13,429
Are you...
Are you okay?

1171
01:14:13,977 --> 01:14:16,342
I'm good. I'm good.

1172
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,666
Thanks for coming
to save me, Max.

1173
01:14:21,570 --> 01:14:23,017
Yay!

1174
01:14:23,017 --> 01:14:25,678
Max! oh-hoh! Max!

1175
01:14:32,153 --> 01:14:33,731
You need a lift?

1176
01:14:34,076 --> 01:14:37,492
Yes, we need a lift!
Let's go, Tattoo!

1177
01:14:42,586 --> 01:14:43,830

1178
01:14:44,915 --> 01:14:45,990

1179
01:15:03,475 --> 01:15:06,750
Hey! Hey!
Uh, Gidget! Wait up!

1180
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,502
- Oh! Hi, Max!

1181
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:11,110

1182
01:15:12,168 --> 01:15:15,537
Yeah, I have...
I, I, I... I just wanted to...

1183
01:15:16,471 --> 01:15:17,625
Look.

1184
01:15:18,391 --> 01:15:20,967
Have you ever lived across
from someone your whole life...

1185
01:15:21,200 --> 01:15:24,370
But, you... But, you don't really
appreciate them until...

1186
01:15:24,790 --> 01:15:26,195
I don't know, until...

1187
01:15:26,213 --> 01:15:29,360
They're beating up a dozens
of animals on the Brooklyn bridge.

1188
01:15:29,502 --> 01:15:31,777
I guess, what I'm tryning
to say is...

1189
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:33,520
If you ever wanna...

1190
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:34,280
Okay.

1191
01:15:34,293 --> 01:15:36,266
Oh, great! You're in love.

1192
01:15:36,266 --> 01:15:38,951
How gross for everyone.
Now, move it!

1193
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:40,586
- Good bye! See you later, Max!
- Good bye.

1194
01:15:40,604 --> 01:15:42,288
Does anyone know
where we are?

1195
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:44,657
- Bye, Max!
- Bye, Gidget.

1196
01:15:44,826 --> 01:15:47,244
- Okay, Bye-bye!
- See you, guys!

1197
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:50,129
Man, I feel sorry for them.

1198
01:15:50,129 --> 01:15:52,120
Gotta run home to thier owners!

1199
01:15:52,120 --> 01:15:53,117
Not us!

1200
01:15:53,117 --> 01:15:56,335
Now, is back to our primary mission!

1201
01:15:56,335 --> 01:15:59,071
The downfall of the human race!

1202
01:15:59,368 --> 01:16:01,031
It is on, humans!

1203
01:16:01,031 --> 01:16:03,030
It is on!

1204
01:16:05,448 --> 01:16:08,124
Mommy!
Can I have a bunny?

1205
01:16:09,200 --> 01:16:11,937
And a pig, and a crocodile
and a lizard?

1206
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:15,893
Uh-oh!

01:16:15,911 --> 01:16:18,050

Uh... What's going on?
What's she doing?

1211
01:16:25,368 --> 01:16:28,434
Bunny, I'm gonna love you
forever and ever, and ever!

1212
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,750
Aww! bunny!

1213
01:18:06,648 --> 01:18:08,000
Here you go.

1214
01:18:48,207 --> 01:18:50,827
Duke, This's the best part
of the day!

1215
01:18:51,497 --> 01:18:54,868

So, how'd it go?

So, maybe a few box.

1224
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:18,205
But, I knew this is gonna work out.

1225
01:19:18,738 --> 01:19:19,628
So...

1226
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,142
Who's hungry?

1227
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:35,072
