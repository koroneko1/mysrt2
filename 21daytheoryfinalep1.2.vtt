00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.280
(Day 21)

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:07.000
I think...

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:09.150
It's kinda strange.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.730
There are already a lot of people who ship X and Mook together.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.080
There's no reason to involve both of you.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.530
I know!

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.600
Why did they have to play around with other people's feelings?

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.240
Nevermind me.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.860
But for Q...

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.220
He was brave enough to come out to us.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.930
But in the end, everything-

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.260
Crashed.

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.570
And did they not even bother to explain anything to you guys?

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.900
Frank.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.550
I saw it with my own eyes.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.310
What can they possibly say?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.840
Man, people these days.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.220
Even if you know their face, you'll never know their heart.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.900
There might be another reason.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.370
How about this.

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.980
I'll go and ask X.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.400
Frank.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.510
Who's side are you on?

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.180
What happened to Q and I hurts even more than you getting punched in the face!

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.840
Even if you killed someone, the court will still ask you why you did it.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.480
I just want to know why they'd do this to my friends.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.880
If you really want to go...

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.750
Then go alone.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.240
Don't involve me in this matter.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:22.510
You're always like this, Toy.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.620
You should also listen to Mook.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.040
So that at least you'll have a solid reason to be angry at her.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.300
Don't just draw your own conclusions in your head.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.420
Q!

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.970
Open your door for me.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.200
Q!

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.710
Will he be okay?

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.860
He's locked himself in his room and won't even go to school.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:55.330
Q!

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:57.620
How about this.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.620
Why don't we just break the door down.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.280
In case something's happened to him, we'll be able to help him in time.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.800
- Move.
- Wait, wait, wait.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.910
Why would you break the door? I have the key right here.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.620
Watch what are you saying, it's making me anxious.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.550
Why didn't you just tell me...

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.260
Q...

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.240
I don't know...

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.980
What happened between you and X.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.510
But why don't you talk to each other properly?

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.040
Last time...

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.180
He came all the way here to try and talk to you.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.600
That means that he really cares about you.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.350
Just let it go, Mom.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.680
I don't want to hear it anymore.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.240
I'll go back to normal soon.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.110
You're angry and sulking.

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.930
Your feelings towards him are more than friends too, right?

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:16.910
Mom...

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.240
I... I-

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.130
I know.

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.500
No matter who you are...

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.370
You're still my son.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.200
Both your Uncle and I...

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:39.460
We'll always be by your side.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.620
And it won't matter if you're happy...

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.480
or if you're disappointed with your choices.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.980
Did I disappoint you?

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.280
Anything that is your happiness...

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.880
I can accept all of it.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.150
Do you want to tell me and your uncle about it?

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.950
What happened?

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.520
Hm?

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.530
My son.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.370
This evening...

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.980
Are you still going to the ceremony with me?

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.560
You can go with someone else.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:19.200
If you don't want to listen to me.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.110
Then see for yourself.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.780
You punched him?!

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.440
My nephew is dangerous when he gets jealous.

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:43.860
Why would you tease him like that?

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.150
You're not going to give X a chance to explain himself?

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.380
It might not be what you think.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.380
Remember that day you played the zombie game with him?

00:05:58.380 --> 00:05:59.060
Hm?

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.420
If anyone heard you guys like we did, they'd be having inappropriate thoughts.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.400
If you don't believe me, you can step on my face.

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.770
Some things are not like what we see.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.820
And some things are not like what we hear.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.130
If it's not actually what you thought...

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.370
You'll be even more devastated.

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:24.780
And it's also not fair towards X.

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:30.780
But no matter what you decide...

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:32.480
Just remember.

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.220
You're not alone.

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:39.150
Hang in there, alright?

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:46.660
Here.

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:51.660
Whether you'll keep it or throw it away.

00:06:52.130 --> 00:06:52.840
It's your choice.

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:57.940
It's like I said.

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.280
When X told me he has a crush on Q...

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:03.440
I was also surprised.

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.710
I'm also very curious.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.980
Who is it that managed to steal the heart of such a perfect boy?

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.860
Why do you want to know?

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:13.950
What about you?

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:16.570
You don't have a partner to go with you yet, right?

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:18.580
I can introduce you to some guys.

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:20.130
No thanks.

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:24.580
I don't want to go with someone who I'm not familiar with.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:25.970
It's too fake.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:30.350
I was thinking of going by myself anyway.

00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:37.400
Do you want some?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:38.640
Thanks.

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:45.130
- Mook?
- Yeah?

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.880
Um...

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:49.930
I...

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:54.160
I want to ask for your help with something.

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:57.200
My help?

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.080
Yeah.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.930
If you're asking me like this...

00:08:02.570 --> 00:08:04.820
Then it must be important, right?

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.350
Can you accept a person's friend request for me?

00:08:08.750 --> 00:08:13.180
And whatever he does, can you take extra care of him for me?

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.350
Extra care?

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.860
Yes.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:19.420
Is it your special someone?

00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:20.860
Hey.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:23.310
Let me see their picture.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.930
I want to know what it is that they have and I don't.

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:28.880
A picture?

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:40.130
The person you like is...?

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:46.460
Sure. I'll help you.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.920
Thank you!

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:53.640
At least I definitely have no way of winning against that person.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.940
No wonder why everything was so easy back then.

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:02.000
That's why you knew which of us was Q.

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:05.300
Do you believe me now?

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.980
X didn't deceive Q.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.100
And it's impossible for him to like me.

00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:15.970
Then...

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:17.080
What about you?

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:19.260
Do you still like X?

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:23.740
Of course.

00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:29.640
But not in that way.

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.510
Now...

00:09:33.530 --> 00:09:35.480
Now...

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:40.060
Hey, X didn't come to school.

00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:42.060
I heard that he had to...

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.600
Wait.

00:09:44.260 --> 00:09:46.310
You guys...

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:49.240
X has to fly to Japan today.

00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:52.260
Do something!

00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:56.600
Do you know what time X's flight is?

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.620
Around 10 p.m. But I think he'll have to check in since 9 p.m.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.060
What about you? What time does your ceremony end?

00:10:04.710 --> 00:10:07.440
Around 10 p.m.

00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:11.020
But... I have to go and get ready beforehand.

00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:14.100
Are you still going to go with me?

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:16.840
I don't think I can go anymore.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:20.100
But I promise I'll be there to pick you up when your ceremony ends.

00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.420
Let's go, Frank!

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.460
Huh? I- I have an appointment with Mind.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.380
Let's go to Q's house!

00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.040
Your friend's matters are more important.

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:32.510
Mind will have to send Mook instead of me anyway.

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.340
Come on!

00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:35.340
You forgot something!

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:37.340
Oh, right.

00:10:37.640 --> 00:10:39.340
- Come on!
- I know!

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:47.120
Why the hell was there so much traffic today?

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.950
Q!!!

00:10:50.510 --> 00:10:52.570
- Mom, hello.
- Mom, hello.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:54.340
Excuse me, where is Q?

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.330
He's upstairs in his room.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:57.060
Can I go meet him? Thank you!

00:10:57.350 --> 00:10:58.710
Sure thing.

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:01.420
Thank you.

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:08.840
Come, come.

00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:14.460
- Q!
- Woah.

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:17.950
What are you guys doing here?

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.280
I'll go back to school tomorrow.

00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:23.880
I was going to go talk to X about you.

00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.310
But I couldn't find him.

00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:27.240
And then Toy dragged me here.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:29.710
Um...

00:11:31.770 --> 00:11:33.480
- Um...
- What is it?

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.480
Frank...

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:39.460
Told me that I should listen to other people's reasons.

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.440
Which, even though I didn't...

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:43.600
But I...

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:46.370
Saw the truth.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.240
What truth?

00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:51.260
Here.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:54.640
Take a look at this.

00:11:58.170 --> 00:11:59.740
Hello, everyone!

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.310
You're back with me, Mook, the queen of content.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:08.570
Today, we're here to interview my friend about his views on love.

00:12:08.570 --> 00:12:09.900
Hello, X!

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:11.900
Look at the camera!

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.800
Hey, don't.

00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.940
Come on.

00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:16.480
I won't post it anywhere, okay?

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.930
What did you want to ask?

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.620
I just want to know...

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:24.350
About Q...

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.020
How is he special?

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:31.530
You're really not going to post this anywhere right?

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:33.080
I won't.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.620
How is he special?

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:41.910
He... might not be special for other people.

00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:44.170
But for me...

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:49.110
He's the reason why I want to come to school every day.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.620
Right from the first day that I've met him.

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.620
Maybe you can call it...

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.060
Love at first sight?

00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:02.970
That's enough.

00:13:02.970 --> 00:13:04.240
Wait, not yet.

00:13:04.530 --> 00:13:07.540
Then why did you just start pursuing him?

00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.900
Didn't you have a crush on him since last year?

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.510
Because I'm scared.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.770
He might feel disgusted.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.900
So I chose to watch from a distance.

00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:20.570
You're not scared anymore?

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.260
Of course I am.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.150
But if I don't do something now...

00:13:25.910 --> 00:13:27.460
And we start going to university...

00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.460
I'm afraid I won't get to see him anymore.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:35.910
That's why it's worth the risk.

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:38.350
No matter what the outcome will be like.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.280
You guys even had a bet.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:47.150
But, I'm sorry.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.750
I didn't ask Q like you told me to.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.130
Wait!

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:57.280
But if he loses, he'll have to do as you ask, right?

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:01.600
That's true.

00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:02.370
But...

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.820
Actually... he didn't lose to me.

00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:08.820
He'd already won.

00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.440
Since the first day that I met him.

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:16.260
He's always my number one.

00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:19.840
I've already decided.

00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:21.910
When I come back from Japan...

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:24.260
I'll ask him to be my boyfriend.

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.530
Then tell me.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:34.940
What method will you use to conquer Q's heart before you graduate?

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:38.000
Well, I only have around 20 days left.

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.530
So I chose to use Dr. Maxwell's '21 Days Theory'.

00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.940
That day, I realized that winning over someone's heart...

00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:48.310
Especially of someone that we love...

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.150
Is one of the proudest things that can happen to you.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:51.460
What are you going to do now?

00:14:52.970 --> 00:14:55.280
Mook said X has to fly to Japan tonight.

00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:58.440
Around 9 p.m.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.260
You can still make it if you go now.

00:15:03.510 --> 00:15:04.640
Then can you drop me off?

00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.080
Sure thing!

00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.400
But...

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.400
I have to pick up Mook at 10 p.m. so...

00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:14.020
Getting a taxi and then taking the airport link there should be a good solution.

00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:16.600
Then drop me off on the main road.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:18.940
Sure, come on!

00:15:22.910 --> 00:15:24.530
We- we didn't hear anything.

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:25.420
I'm leaving first!

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:27.950
Bye mom! Bye uncle!

00:15:29.750 --> 00:15:31.730
Hey, what about me?!

00:15:35.530 --> 00:15:36.880
Um... Mom...

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:39.570
Do you happen to have some extra rice?

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:59.940
It's unbelievable how the time I spent getting to the airport was as long as the flight to Singapore.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:02.530
Of course.

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:04.730
I didn't make it in time.

00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:09.240
It might be too late right now...

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.570
But it's okay. I'll wait.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:17.600
Toy is more lucky than me.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.820
Speaking of which, he unknowingly used the 21 Days Theory with Mook as well.

00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:27.260
And Frank is still determined on becoming a doctor.

00:16:27.930 --> 00:16:32.110
And Mind is there to strictly tutor him even more.

00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.530
Today we're here to meet 'Mommy Bakery'!

00:16:36.530 --> 00:16:37.170
Can we stop for a moment?

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:38.180
Frank.

00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.180
Move out to the right.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:43.510
And as for me, I have very nice friends.

00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:45.220
They understand who I am.

00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:49.460
And I'm also fulfilling my duties as a good son.

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.980
(2 months later)

00:16:59.570 --> 00:17:01.540
We have to thank Mook.

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.150
Every since she reviewed our shop, we've been getting so many orders.

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:06.200
It's amazing.

00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.020
Q, come help me!

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.040
Can you deliver this order for me?

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.060
Uncle.

00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.530
Ever since the start of my holiday...

00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.040
I've been wrapping them up and delivering them for you guys.

00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:24.110
Can you deliver it for me?

00:17:24.680 --> 00:17:25.570
Please?

00:17:27.570 --> 00:17:29.350
Are you sure?

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.720
(To: X. 
Address: RK Condo B Tower.
Ps. Can I request for the person named Q to deliver this?)

00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:44.350
Uncle!

00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:46.820
I can deliver it to him!

00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:49.510
Let me go get changed first.

00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.750
I'm here to deliver some snacks.

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:23.960
I don't have any cash on me. Can I pay with a kiss instead?
