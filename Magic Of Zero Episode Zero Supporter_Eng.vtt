00:00:31.685 --> 00:00:34.540
When will we get there? It’s been hours.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:37.800
Hang in there. The traffic is bad today.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.672
But I’m hungry.

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:40.624
Are you hungry?

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:41.464
Yes.

00:00:41.558 --> 00:00:42.391
Let me feed you.

00:00:42.391 --> 00:00:43.558
What do you have?

00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:44.619
A snack.

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:45.406
What snack?

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:47.630
Here.

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:48.866
It got on your face?

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:49.735
Yes.

00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:51.655
No. Don’t take it off just yet.

00:00:54.151 --> 00:00:56.151
You won’t be surprised if you take it off.

00:00:56.151 --> 00:00:57.747
All right. I’ll feed you properly.

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:00.234
No. You’ll poke it in my nose again.

00:01:00.234 --> 00:01:02.085
I won’t do that anymore.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.209
Did you get it?

00:01:04.344 --> 00:01:04.904
No.

00:01:06.144 --> 00:01:07.537
- Okay now?
- Okay

00:01:08.718 --> 00:01:10.606
Have you heard this saying?

00:01:10.606 --> 00:01:12.603
“Almost everything comes from nothing.”

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:16.145
Almost everything on this planet starts from zero.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:06.396
We have arrived.

00:02:06.936 --> 00:02:07.696
Really?

00:02:07.696 --> 00:02:08.196
Yes.

00:02:08.196 --> 00:02:09.611
No. Not yet.

00:02:09.611 --> 00:02:11.051
Seriously? Come on.

00:02:11.051 --> 00:02:13.397
No. Wait a sec.

00:02:15.071 --> 00:02:17.611
(Well, I’m not a naive kid.)

00:02:17.743 --> 00:02:19.653
(I’m 30 years old now.)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.462
(I kinda know why Korn takes me to his house in Bangkok.)

00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:26.511
(He had me wear a blindfold from Chonburi to here.)

00:02:26.511 --> 00:02:28.511
(He must have planned a great surprise for me.)

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:30.131
Walk slowly.

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:31.905
What are you trying to do here?

00:02:31.905 --> 00:02:32.948
Come on.

00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:35.310
(Do you have any idea what it could be?)

00:02:37.762 --> 00:02:38.509
Ready?

00:02:39.477 --> 00:02:40.215
Um.

00:02:41.139 --> 00:02:42.063
You sure?

00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:43.821
Um.

00:03:01.045 --> 00:03:03.045
Welcome to our home, Win.

00:03:04.336 --> 00:03:05.384
(Our home.)

00:03:05.901 --> 00:03:07.528
(He said our home.)

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:09.829
(This is where we spend our time together.)

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.450
(Have breakfast in bed.)

00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:13.775
(Grow healthy hydroponic vegetables.)

00:03:14.421 --> 00:03:15.532
(He's the first person I see when I get up in the morning

00:03:15.644 --> 00:03:18.108
and the last person I see before going to bed.)

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:40.667
Win.

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.214
Hm?

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.425
(We’ll be happy together and love each other forever.)

00:04:00.515 --> 00:04:01.236
Win!

00:04:02.253 --> 00:04:03.113
Win!

00:04:04.405 --> 00:04:05.613
Win!

00:04:08.808 --> 00:04:09.600
Did you call my name?

00:04:09.887 --> 00:04:11.887
Yes. Several times.

00:04:12.153 --> 00:04:13.008
Are you okay?

00:04:13.278 --> 00:04:14.423
I’m okay.

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:17.070
Can I take this blindfold off now?

00:04:17.861 --> 00:04:18.653
Can I take this blindfold off now?

00:04:23.107 --> 00:04:24.248
Surprise!

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.521
How is it? Our home.

00:04:31.643 --> 00:04:33.823
Hey. Are you happy?

00:04:36.824 --> 00:04:38.014
Aren’t you happy?

00:04:40.914 --> 00:04:41.718
Let’s get inside.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.636
Come on.

00:04:46.178 --> 00:04:47.298
Let’s get inside.

00:04:48.378 --> 00:04:50.225
There are many things for you to eat.

00:05:11.636 --> 00:05:12.412
It’s messy.

00:05:13.334 --> 00:05:15.953
Sorry. I don’t have time to clean it up yet.

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.935
I see.

00:05:34.307 --> 00:05:36.440
Give me a sec. It’s Chef Phat.

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:41.177
Hello.

00:05:42.226 --> 00:05:43.956
Yes, I’m in Bangkok.

00:05:44.981 --> 00:05:46.097
Right now?

00:05:50.911 --> 00:05:51.615
Go.

00:05:53.073 --> 00:05:54.511
Okay. I’ll be there shortly.

00:05:57.721 --> 00:05:59.406
I need to be there urgently.

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.309
I heard it. Just go.

00:06:01.309 --> 00:06:02.292
I'll take care of this.

00:06:02.549 --> 00:06:04.549
I’ll make some delicious bakery for you.

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:05.560
Okay?

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:08.589
See you later.

00:06:13.165 --> 00:06:16.312
(You probably wonder why I don’t get jealous, right?)

00:06:16.836 --> 00:06:21.198
(I know well how much Chef Phat likes Korn.)

00:06:22.536 --> 00:06:26.156
(I'm not jealous because this is Korn's dream.)

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:04.495
(As Warodom's farm begins to profit)

00:07:05.005 --> 00:07:09.075
(we decided to open a new branch of Korn's bakery in Bangkok.)

00:07:09.472 --> 00:07:12.417
(So Korn has to take extra baking classes.)

00:07:12.642 --> 00:07:13.452
Chef Phat.

00:07:15.241 --> 00:07:16.141
Hi, Korn.

00:07:17.378 --> 00:07:20.188
Wow. You have prepared so many ingredients.

00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:23.858
(It’s also the main reason I moved to live with Korn in his house.)

00:07:26.014 --> 00:07:27.834
(He has done so many things for me.)

00:07:28.137 --> 00:07:30.000
(It’s my turn to do something for him for a change.)

00:07:31.974 --> 00:07:35.166
(It’s common to support your loved one, right?)

00:07:37.455 --> 00:07:41.142
(But being a supporter is pretty exhausting.)

00:08:00.997 --> 00:08:01.740
Chef Phat.

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.909
Win is now living with me.

00:08:05.139 --> 00:08:07.881
It’s not convenient to have you there at my place.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:11.511
I understand.

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:16.989
Win must not know about this no matter what, right?

00:08:17.515 --> 00:08:18.443
Yes.

00:08:19.515 --> 00:08:20.587
Thank you so much.

00:08:20.587 --> 00:08:21.514
Anytime.

00:08:22.934 --> 00:08:24.732
You separate the flour.

00:08:24.732 --> 00:08:25.786
I’ll separate the eggs.

00:08:48.038 --> 00:08:49.318
I’m back.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.640
Where is he?

00:09:08.609 --> 00:09:09.619
Win!

00:09:22.115 --> 00:09:22.916
Win.

00:09:23.456 --> 00:09:24.273
What are you doing?

00:09:24.838 --> 00:09:26.118
I’m washing the rags.

00:09:27.392 --> 00:09:29.077
Why don't you throw them in the washing machine?

00:09:29.535 --> 00:09:32.502
I shouldn’t do that. The rags are dirty.

00:09:32.697 --> 00:09:34.292
The machine will get dirty.

00:09:35.672 --> 00:09:37.245
I’ll help.

00:09:38.439 --> 00:09:41.069
Don’t. I’d rather do this on my own.

00:09:41.069 --> 00:09:42.418
I feel like stepping on something.

00:09:42.553 --> 00:09:43.852
Let me.

00:09:51.383 --> 00:09:52.067
Ouch.

00:09:52.607 --> 00:09:53.923
Did you do that on purpose?

00:09:54.237 --> 00:09:55.011
Yes.

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.433
Are you mad?

00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:00.487
Come on.

00:10:00.862 --> 00:10:03.120
I rushed back here to help you.

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:04.772
I’ll give you a rub down.

00:10:05.132 --> 00:10:06.922
I’ll make your tiredness gone, babe.

00:10:09.837 --> 00:10:10.915
You are not mad anymore.

00:10:21.224 --> 00:10:21.865
Win.

00:10:22.877 --> 00:10:24.034
Thank you so much.

00:10:24.244 --> 00:10:25.794
My house is much cleaner now.

00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:28.399
I don’t like to be in a messy place.

00:10:37.029 --> 00:10:39.029
Stomp your feet properly.

00:10:39.569 --> 00:10:41.074
You're splattering it all over the place.

00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.000
Stop complaining.

00:10:52.399 --> 00:10:53.197
Korn.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.282
Did you smoke?

00:10:56.542 --> 00:10:57.400
No.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:00.159
I can smell cigarette smoke coming from you.

00:11:01.004 --> 00:11:04.354
I bought you a lot of food.

00:11:04.354 --> 00:11:05.480
There are so many.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:07.399
I’ll plate them for you.

00:11:14.442 --> 00:11:15.925
(From zero)

00:11:16.225 --> 00:11:21.667
(it should increase to one, two, then three until it reaches the full mark.)

00:11:22.558 --> 00:11:23.883
(Who knows?)

00:11:23.883 --> 00:11:28.141
(Something could begin at zero and decrease to minus.)

00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:55.304
Here you go. Drink this too.

00:11:55.304 --> 00:11:56.537
It’s good and healthy stuff.

00:12:06.974 --> 00:12:07.816
Wow.

00:12:09.123 --> 00:12:10.175
It tastes good.

00:12:10.465 --> 00:12:12.465
I had no idea this had zero sugar.

00:12:13.118 --> 00:12:14.735
It makes me feel like I'm in Japan.

00:12:15.013 --> 00:12:16.417
Do you want to go to Japan after drinking it?

00:12:18.201 --> 00:12:20.095
Let me show you this photo.

00:12:22.914 --> 00:12:24.829
It makes me feel like I’m in this kind of place.

00:12:24.829 --> 00:12:27.997
I'd like to visit a tea plantation and pluck some tea leaves.

00:12:27.997 --> 00:12:30.017
Let's go to a tea plantation at the end of the year when the weather is cool.

00:12:30.687 --> 00:12:33.785
Not in Chiang Rai, but in Japan.

00:12:34.576 --> 00:12:35.511
Are we going to Japan?

00:12:36.374 --> 00:12:37.184
I take your word for it.

00:12:38.985 --> 00:12:40.665
But you'll have to wait till the end of the year.

00:12:40.665 --> 00:12:42.079
I'm really busy right now.

00:12:42.079 --> 00:12:43.158
Our bakery will be open soon.

00:12:44.515 --> 00:12:45.525
That makes sense.

00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:50.491
For now, I'm happy with just some good food around here.

00:12:50.632 --> 00:12:53.905
I'll take you on a food tour with your favorite foods.

00:12:54.431 --> 00:12:55.962
Good. Let’s do that.

00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.154
Korn.

00:13:15.466 --> 00:13:17.487
Isn’t it too early to go out and eat?

00:13:17.487 --> 00:13:18.992
It’s not even 8 o’clock yet.

00:13:20.075 --> 00:13:22.778
Sorry. I need to see Chef Phat today.

00:13:23.008 --> 00:13:24.076
He doesn’t have much free time.

00:13:25.008 --> 00:13:26.025
Chef Phat?

00:13:28.446 --> 00:13:30.065
But you told me you were free today.

00:13:31.098 --> 00:13:33.013
I’ll hurry back and take you out later in the evening.

00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:40.051
Aren’t you gonna eat something before you leave?

00:13:40.266 --> 00:13:42.665
Nah. I have to go right away.

00:13:44.230 --> 00:13:46.305
You should consider cutting down on eating though.

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:48.170
Your face is getting big.

00:13:49.067 --> 00:13:50.769
Gotta go. See you.

00:13:53.065 --> 00:13:54.001
Did you just call me fat?

00:13:56.305 --> 00:13:57.146
Katin,

00:13:57.913 --> 00:13:59.385
he has the audacity to say I'm fat.

00:13:59.385 --> 00:14:00.991
People eat when they are hungry, right?

00:14:00.991 --> 00:14:02.863
He said he would take me out to eat today.

00:14:03.250 --> 00:14:04.845
Now he had something else to do all of a sudden.

00:14:06.277 --> 00:14:07.553
I’m not mad, though.

00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:12.377
Or else I wouldn’t plan to make him a lunchbox.

00:14:13.815 --> 00:14:14.419
Let’s go.

00:14:14.781 --> 00:14:16.177
Let’s make a lunchbox.

00:14:26.853 --> 00:14:27.959
Isn’t this cute?

00:14:28.245 --> 00:14:30.245
I’m taking this to Korn now.

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.043
This one is more aromatic.

00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.390
It’s more refreshing, right?

00:14:46.333 --> 00:14:47.372
It has a fruity smell.

00:14:47.372 --> 00:14:49.185
You can taste the dried fruits.

00:14:52.903 --> 00:14:55.031
How is it? It’s truly refreshing, right?

00:14:55.345 --> 00:14:57.068
Yes. It has a sweet taste to it

00:15:00.586 --> 00:15:01.990
and tangy taste.

00:15:03.823 --> 00:15:07.612
Let’s see if it still tastes like this when we brew it.

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:15.995
I told you I'd call you when I needed to place an order.

00:15:16.285 --> 00:15:17.575
Don't stand there and put pressure on me.

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.163
Have you been here long?

00:15:28.665 --> 00:15:29.494
Yes.

00:15:29.959 --> 00:15:31.056
Why didn’t you get something to eat?

00:15:32.163 --> 00:15:34.748
Look. There are just vegetarian options.

00:15:34.881 --> 00:15:36.825
I don’t remember saying I would go for a vegetarian dish.

00:15:37.464 --> 00:15:38.825
They have something else too.

00:15:39.243 --> 00:15:40.178
Something else?

00:15:40.178 --> 00:15:42.074
But the main ingredients are veggies. Didn’t you see?

00:15:42.074 --> 00:15:44.873
You should have asked me when you picked this restaurant.

00:15:45.104 --> 00:15:46.109
I don’t want to eat veggies.

00:15:46.225 --> 00:15:49.840
You've been eating unhealthy foods lately.

00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.176
I want you to eat some greens.

00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:53.510
Come on. For your good health.

00:15:55.226 --> 00:15:56.544
Are you telling me that I’m fat?

00:15:58.352 --> 00:15:59.917
What's up with you?

00:16:00.185 --> 00:16:02.410
You've been grumpy since I arrived.

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.514
I don’t have a good figure like you,

00:16:05.173 --> 00:16:06.380
like your Chef Phat.

00:16:07.722 --> 00:16:09.025
What does this have to do with Chef Phat?

00:16:09.025 --> 00:16:09.837
It does.

00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.545
You had a date with me today.

00:16:12.586 --> 00:16:15.843
But you hurried to Chef Phat after answering his phone call.

00:16:15.843 --> 00:16:17.241
He must be so important to you.

00:16:17.386 --> 00:16:18.768
You keep protecting him.

00:16:18.946 --> 00:16:21.065
I know those cigarette butts are his.

00:16:21.121 --> 00:16:22.503
I simply did not want to bring that up.

00:16:22.750 --> 00:16:24.750
So, what's the big deal?

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:27.806
I told you Chef Phat didn’t have much time

00:16:27.806 --> 00:16:29.125
so I had to bother him to teach me today.

00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:31.242
I came to see you here as soon as I can, didn’t I?

00:16:31.242 --> 00:16:33.566
I thought we could spend some quality time together over nice meals.

00:16:33.566 --> 00:16:35.443
Now I don’t think I have any appetite to eat.

00:16:37.915 --> 00:16:39.112
Then don’t eat.

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:41.107
I don’t want to eat as well.

00:16:43.699 --> 00:16:44.634
Then we go home.

00:16:45.077 --> 00:16:48.440
(Our tiredness prevents us from being sweet to one other.)

00:17:03.534 --> 00:17:04.297
Win.

00:17:08.514 --> 00:17:09.453
Win.

00:17:13.851 --> 00:17:14.671
Win!

00:17:14.671 --> 00:17:16.320
You don't think you're at fault, do you?

00:17:18.513 --> 00:17:19.265
Hey.

00:17:21.778 --> 00:17:22.600
Win!

00:17:24.763 --> 00:17:25.806
Win.

00:17:27.126 --> 00:17:28.509
Will you stop?

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:32.572
And then think about what is causing all of this.

00:17:33.681 --> 00:17:37.129
You told me to stop talking because you're tired of me, right?

00:17:39.429 --> 00:17:41.685
I just want you to get yourself together.

00:17:41.685 --> 00:17:42.857
Then we can work this out together.

00:17:44.225 --> 00:17:45.555
Are you saying that I can't think straight for myself?

00:17:45.981 --> 00:17:46.779
Huh?

00:17:47.527 --> 00:17:48.107
Win,

00:17:48.665 --> 00:17:50.426
that is not what I meant.

00:17:50.629 --> 00:17:52.629
I do everything for you.

00:17:52.629 --> 00:17:54.013
You do it for me, really?

00:17:55.164 --> 00:17:56.745
But I don’t feel it that way.

00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:58.665
I can only see you doing it for yourself.

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:02.140
If you keep shutting yourself off from me like this,

00:18:02.305 --> 00:18:04.497
I can't make you understand no matter what I do.

00:18:04.497 --> 00:18:06.369
Fine. I go shut myself down.

00:18:06.757 --> 00:18:08.757
I make no sense anyway, right?

00:18:21.907 --> 00:18:22.600
Korn!

00:18:23.111 --> 00:18:26.015
Win, where are you?

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.802
Korn. Win.

00:18:29.971 --> 00:18:30.864
Who’s that?

00:18:31.831 --> 00:18:36.387
Korn, are we both dead?

00:18:39.177 --> 00:18:41.283
It’s not your time to die yet.

00:18:41.646 --> 00:18:44.157
But there is now chaos.

00:18:57.521 --> 00:18:58.754
-Korn.
-Win.

00:19:01.775 --> 00:19:03.775
You two have swapped bodies.

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:04.974
We’ve swapped bodies!

00:19:05.890 --> 00:19:06.841
Again?

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.920
Can you help us swap back to our own bodies?

00:19:14.146 --> 00:19:19.703
When you genuinely understand each other, things will return to normal.

00:19:20.575 --> 00:19:24.300
Hahahahaha.

00:19:36.033 --> 00:19:37.048
What a dream?

00:19:37.687 --> 00:19:38.905
It’s not a dream.

00:19:39.882 --> 00:19:40.668
Shit!

00:19:46.644 --> 00:19:49.070
Korn, is this true?

00:19:49.070 --> 00:19:50.526
Yes, it’s me.

00:19:51.315 --> 00:19:56.185
How come we are in this room?

00:19:56.494 --> 00:19:59.154
I don’t know either. It could be a miracle.

00:20:00.627 --> 00:20:05.034
Gosh. Why did this kind of thing happen to me again?

00:20:06.188 --> 00:20:08.060
Am I a body-swap master or what?

00:20:08.555 --> 00:20:12.408
If you hadn’t gotten out of the car, this kind of thing would not have happened.

00:20:13.296 --> 00:20:14.310
Damn it, Korn.

00:20:14.821 --> 00:20:16.638
You blame everything on me again.

00:20:17.212 --> 00:20:18.765
You are never at fault?

00:20:18.863 --> 00:20:20.105
It’s always me, right?

00:20:20.492 --> 00:20:21.981
Stop being sarcastic for a second.

00:20:22.207 --> 00:20:24.101
Let’s find a way to swap back to our bodies.

00:20:24.101 --> 00:20:26.149
See? You are blaming me again.

00:20:26.428 --> 00:20:27.555
Why, Korn?

00:20:27.555 --> 00:20:30.312
Why is it always me who has to adjust myself?

00:20:30.312 --> 00:20:32.631
You have never done wrong.

00:20:34.591 --> 00:20:36.105
I don’t think we can talk it out today.

00:20:36.242 --> 00:20:38.242
Then, don’t talk at all.

00:20:38.448 --> 00:20:40.022
Go talk with your Chef Phat.

00:20:41.015 --> 00:20:42.504
You seem to understand each other so well.

00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:46.241
How could I go to him? I’m in your body.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:50.300
You want to go back to your body because you want to see Chef Phat, right?

00:20:50.537 --> 00:20:52.367
Will the world end if you don't see him for a day?

00:20:52.367 --> 00:20:53.180
Win.

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:56.592
I’m Korn. Can’t you see how I look? I’m Korn.

00:20:56.915 --> 00:21:00.825
Good. Now that I’m in your body, I will use it to see your Chef Phat.

00:21:00.983 --> 00:21:04.005
I'll find out for myself if my suspicions are correct.

00:21:04.744 --> 00:21:06.403
I don’t have an appointment with Chef Phat today.

00:21:07.587 --> 00:21:09.630
What is your plan today? I will do it for you.

00:21:09.866 --> 00:21:10.730
Can you do it?

00:21:10.945 --> 00:21:13.745
I can do it. I can do everything you can do.

00:21:13.745 --> 00:21:16.237
What about you? Can you do what I do?

00:21:16.599 --> 00:21:17.366
What is it?

00:21:20.304 --> 00:21:21.708
[Sweep the floor.]
[Doctor appointment - Tomorrow!!]

00:21:21.708 --> 00:21:22.540
[Keep calm and sweep on]
[Dust out, mob the floor]

00:21:22.540 --> 00:21:23.124
[Change bed sheet]

00:21:23.124 --> 00:21:23.624
[Wash and hang dry]

00:21:23.624 --> 00:21:24.124
[Clean bathroom]

00:21:24.124 --> 00:21:24.668
[Empty trash bin]

00:21:24.998 --> 00:21:26.210
Come on, Win.

00:21:26.848 --> 00:21:29.338
I can complete these chores in a short amount of time.

00:21:38.969 --> 00:21:41.629
But now, there is a more important thing to take care of.

00:21:55.671 --> 00:21:57.117
This may sound weird.

00:21:57.117 --> 00:22:00.233
If Korn comes to see you, don’t tell him anything. Okay?

00:22:28.442 --> 00:22:30.244
Why are you showing up so late?

00:22:30.488 --> 00:22:31.692
I can't reach you via phone either.

00:22:31.692 --> 00:22:33.607
I’m sorry. I was lost.

00:22:33.725 --> 00:22:36.941
If you're going to be late, please call me ahead of time.

00:22:36.982 --> 00:22:38.604
So I don’t have to wait for you.

00:22:38.604 --> 00:22:40.965
Didn't you hear me when I said I was lost? I didn’t intend to be late.

00:22:43.341 --> 00:22:46.964
Forget it. Now that you are here. Let’s do the inspection.

00:23:05.161 --> 00:23:06.077
Hey, Win.

00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:08.288
Korn doesn’t come here today.

00:23:08.512 --> 00:23:09.937
He’s probably at the store.

00:23:11.954 --> 00:23:13.070
Yes, I know.

00:23:16.653 --> 00:23:18.078
This may sound weird.

00:23:18.279 --> 00:23:19.114
If Win…

00:23:21.325 --> 00:23:24.502
If Korn comes to see you and asks about me,

00:23:25.827 --> 00:23:27.230
don’t tell him anything. Okay?

00:23:28.428 --> 00:23:29.433
Come again?

00:23:30.165 --> 00:23:31.679
It may be a bit difficult to understand.

00:23:32.464 --> 00:23:33.250
If…

00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:38.599
he asks about me, don’t tell him.

00:23:39.009 --> 00:23:39.881
If…

00:23:39.881 --> 00:23:41.646
Just keep reminding yourself not to tell him anything.

00:23:42.438 --> 00:23:44.232
- Just that.
- Okay. I won’t say anything.

00:23:44.232 --> 00:23:44.991
Don’t say anything.

00:23:46.152 --> 00:23:46.871
You are clear now, right?

00:23:46.871 --> 00:23:47.577
Yes.

00:23:51.168 --> 00:23:52.323
That’s all I’m here for.

00:23:53.362 --> 00:23:54.484
Okay, Win.

00:23:56.091 --> 00:23:56.877
I’m leaving.

00:23:56.877 --> 00:23:57.958
See you, Win.

00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.230
Please sign if you agree with the completed work.

00:24:07.972 --> 00:24:09.795
These are all we have for you to inspect today.

00:24:09.885 --> 00:24:10.671
Are we done?

00:24:11.533 --> 00:24:16.550
For the next lot, I will request your payment around mid-month.

00:24:16.550 --> 00:24:18.106
No problem. I’ll ask Kor…

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:24.924
I mean I will prepare the payment for you.

00:24:25.685 --> 00:24:27.685
Okay. I’m heading out then.

00:24:28.711 --> 00:24:29.782
Have a good day.

00:24:35.605 --> 00:24:36.942
What a long day.

00:24:43.910 --> 00:24:45.604
Korn.

00:24:49.092 --> 00:24:49.796
Yes?

00:24:50.150 --> 00:24:53.038
I’m ready to learn today. Are you ready to teach me?

00:24:54.537 --> 00:24:56.051
You forgot, right?

00:24:56.437 --> 00:25:00.140
You said you would teach me how to make Japanese-style cakes today.

00:25:02.035 --> 00:25:03.016
Today?

00:25:03.348 --> 00:25:04.544
Today is not convenient for me.

00:25:04.544 --> 00:25:06.521
Can we do it later?

00:25:06.597 --> 00:25:08.862
But it's my boyfriend's birthday today.

00:25:08.862 --> 00:25:11.864
It won't be a surprise if I don't have a cake for him today.

00:25:11.976 --> 00:25:14.241
You have promised to me.

00:25:14.771 --> 00:25:17.611
(I can’t either say no or teach her.)

00:25:17.723 --> 00:25:18.684
(What should I do?)

00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:22.336
If my boyfriend breaks up with me, it will be on you.

00:25:22.495 --> 00:25:27.159
(If she learns from me and her boyfriend eats the cake I make, they might end up splitting anyway.)

00:25:30.604 --> 00:25:35.280
I prepared all the ingredients and I followed the recipe exactly.

00:25:35.526 --> 00:25:36.525
Here’s flour.

00:25:37.719 --> 00:25:38.351
Flour?

00:25:41.181 --> 00:25:42.484
It must be sifted first, right?

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:44.393
Yes.

00:25:44.827 --> 00:25:47.764
Why don’t you do it? It’s for your boyfriend’s birthday, isn’t it?

00:25:48.194 --> 00:25:49.973
I have another set of ingredients.

00:25:49.973 --> 00:25:52.394
You do your cake and I follow.

00:25:52.394 --> 00:25:54.804
This way I can proudly claim that I bake the cake myself.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.057
Here. Hold it still.

00:26:08.057 --> 00:26:08.926
Just this wide.

00:26:09.465 --> 00:26:11.465
Gently sift so it won’t go out of the bowl.

00:26:11.465 --> 00:26:12.546
Look it’s all over the place.

00:26:13.461 --> 00:26:14.842
What’s with that reaction?

00:26:15.291 --> 00:26:16.606
I’m here to help.

00:26:16.922 --> 00:26:18.115
(Why did he come here?)

00:26:18.823 --> 00:26:20.006
(But it could be a good thing.)

00:26:20.231 --> 00:26:22.607
(I might learn what is going on between him and Korn.)

00:26:22.835 --> 00:26:24.349
I was just startled.

00:26:24.658 --> 00:26:26.172
I thought we didn’t have a class today.

00:26:28.074 --> 00:26:29.234
I miss you.

00:26:31.055 --> 00:26:31.781
Woah.

00:26:31.964 --> 00:26:34.697
You have quite a big reaction nowadays.

00:26:35.389 --> 00:26:36.242
Just kidding.

00:26:36.507 --> 00:26:38.848
Win came to see me out of the blue.

00:26:39.127 --> 00:26:40.604
And he said something weird.

00:26:41.244 --> 00:26:42.268
What did he say?

00:26:42.533 --> 00:26:45.809
He said if we talked,

00:26:46.321 --> 00:26:47.768
I must not say anything to you.

00:26:48.168 --> 00:26:51.605
I’m a bit perplexed so I’m here to see you.

00:26:52.459 --> 00:26:55.896
(Damn it, Korn. You even warned Chef Phat about me?)

00:26:56.192 --> 00:26:57.308
(Wait until I see you.)

00:26:57.842 --> 00:26:59.311
What’s the next step, Korn?

00:27:02.672 --> 00:27:03.409
What is it?

00:27:04.672 --> 00:27:05.935
The cake we are making.

00:27:06.527 --> 00:27:09.013
Look at you. You have flour all over.

00:27:09.576 --> 00:27:11.222
Here, Korn. Put it in.

00:27:17.310 --> 00:27:18.426
How to set this thing?

00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:36.554
You okay there, Korn?

00:27:36.554 --> 00:27:38.655
Chef Phat, can you take care of this for me?

00:27:38.655 --> 00:27:39.672
My nose is running.

00:27:39.672 --> 00:27:40.778
Okay. Give it to me.

00:27:41.268 --> 00:27:42.560
Go take care of yourself.

00:27:49.707 --> 00:27:50.579
Better now?

00:27:52.414 --> 00:27:53.542
Are you okay?

00:27:54.044 --> 00:27:55.115
I’m okay.

00:27:57.545 --> 00:27:59.545
Don’t you have anything else to do?

00:27:59.921 --> 00:28:00.637
Why?

00:28:01.709 --> 00:28:03.324
Do you want me to visit your place?

00:28:05.356 --> 00:28:08.108
Didn’t you already visit my place?

00:28:08.597 --> 00:28:10.376
I’ve been there a lot of times.

00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:11.844
Come here.

00:28:12.773 --> 00:28:13.869
Hold on.

00:28:14.436 --> 00:28:15.351
Woah.

00:28:16.147 --> 00:28:17.696
Do you have to push me away this quickly?

00:28:18.497 --> 00:28:23.284
Come on, Korn. I keep the secret between us.

00:28:24.504 --> 00:28:27.644
When will you let me get it?

00:28:27.644 --> 00:28:29.303
What? Get it?

00:28:30.169 --> 00:28:31.594
What do I have to give to you?

00:28:32.055 --> 00:28:32.802
Hey.

00:28:33.576 --> 00:28:35.084
You said to me yourself.

00:28:35.181 --> 00:28:37.933
When this matter with Win is over, you will give me a reward.

00:28:38.154 --> 00:28:39.363
What reward?

00:28:40.138 --> 00:28:41.298
What did we promise?

00:28:42.184 --> 00:28:44.184
Don’t act like you have already forgotten about it.

00:28:44.986 --> 00:28:46.986
Are you all right? You are a bit not yourself today.

00:28:49.564 --> 00:28:50.724
I’m a bit…

00:28:52.086 --> 00:28:53.179
unwell.

00:28:53.646 --> 00:28:55.034
Aw.. you poor thing.

00:28:55.034 --> 00:28:55.764
Let me see.

00:28:57.471 --> 00:28:58.621
Your body temperature is not high.

00:28:58.997 --> 00:29:01.616
(This is too much. Should I teach him a lesson?)

00:29:01.886 --> 00:29:05.301
(He’s this slim. I can knock him over with just one kick.)

00:29:06.165 --> 00:29:08.165
Do you want to see the doctor? I can drive for you.

00:29:08.576 --> 00:29:11.136
No. I’m fine.

00:29:12.438 --> 00:29:15.018
I’m back. How’s the cake?

00:29:17.255 --> 00:29:18.260
Take a look yourself.

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.759
My muscles have most likely disappeared.

00:29:32.759 --> 00:29:34.390
I've been working on chores all day.

00:29:34.491 --> 00:29:35.844
I still have laundry to do and clothes to hang dry.

00:29:50.334 --> 00:29:52.334
It’s been over an hour already.

00:29:52.334 --> 00:29:54.212
If Win is back and my work here is not done,

00:29:54.212 --> 00:29:55.390
he’ll chew me out.

00:29:59.282 --> 00:30:00.113
Shit.

00:30:02.546 --> 00:30:04.084
I don’t want to do it now.

00:30:04.084 --> 00:30:05.155
[Dust out, mob the floor]

00:30:05.284 --> 00:30:06.113
Come on.

00:30:07.999 --> 00:30:08.982
Is it broken?

00:30:10.024 --> 00:30:11.383
Do I have to wash it by hand instead?

00:30:11.791 --> 00:30:13.044
[Wash and hang dry]

00:30:13.044 --> 00:30:14.121
[Change bed sheet]

00:30:21.325 --> 00:30:22.524
Come on.

00:30:23.684 --> 00:30:24.556
[Empty trash bin] [Clean bathroom]

00:30:25.097 --> 00:30:26.804
I haven't finished everything yet.

00:31:05.515 --> 00:31:07.051
Wow.

00:31:07.748 --> 00:31:10.279
Thank you very much, Korn.

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:11.564
Thank you.

00:31:11.675 --> 00:31:13.274
You should thank Chef Phat.

00:31:13.498 --> 00:31:15.498
I didn’t do anything much.

00:31:15.866 --> 00:31:19.444
I just helped a bit. This is pretty easy already.

00:31:19.444 --> 00:31:21.444
I really appreciate it.

00:31:21.444 --> 00:31:24.726
My boyfriend will surely love this.

00:31:24.904 --> 00:31:26.661
I have to go now.

00:31:27.061 --> 00:31:28.774
My staff at the hotel called me.

00:31:28.986 --> 00:31:30.323
I need to go there and check that out.

00:31:30.323 --> 00:31:33.145
(Is he leaving? I haven’t asked and got the info yet.)

00:31:34.171 --> 00:31:37.255
Chef Phat, let me go with you.

00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:42.441
It’s all right. We have to see each other at the hotel tomorrow anyway.

00:31:44.598 --> 00:31:46.598
I can’t help feeling excited for you.

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:49.008
See you tomorrow at the hotel.

00:31:49.844 --> 00:31:51.035
Please excuse me.

00:31:51.035 --> 00:31:52.148
Thank you again.

00:31:52.148 --> 00:31:53.489
(Why did he say he was excited?)

00:31:53.489 --> 00:31:54.936
(Why do they have to meet at the hotel?)

00:31:55.622 --> 00:31:56.713
(What will happen tomorrow?)

00:31:57.755 --> 00:31:59.084
(My brain is about to explode!)

00:32:06.701 --> 00:32:07.728
It’s nothing.

00:32:08.535 --> 00:32:09.644
[Clean bathroom]

00:32:12.531 --> 00:32:14.000
I’m aching all over.

00:32:18.087 --> 00:32:20.883
When will the food I ordered arrive?

00:32:24.992 --> 00:32:25.925
It could be here now.

00:32:53.675 --> 00:32:55.184
Have I finished all myself?

00:32:56.943 --> 00:33:00.071
(Does Win eat a lot because his tired body needs energy?)

00:33:00.791 --> 00:33:02.481
(I should not have blamed him.)

00:33:10.826 --> 00:33:11.748
I must be at the hotel, right?

00:33:12.124 --> 00:33:12.964
How did you know?

00:33:12.964 --> 00:33:14.380
Chef Phat told me.

00:33:35.471 --> 00:33:37.471
Well well well.

00:33:37.755 --> 00:33:38.513
Win,

00:33:39.034 --> 00:33:40.476
I didn’t know you were back.

00:33:41.246 --> 00:33:42.037
Why?

00:33:42.437 --> 00:33:43.994
Did you expect me to yell as I walked into the house?

00:33:44.224 --> 00:33:47.024
If I did that, I wouldn't be able to see how much you eat.

00:33:47.497 --> 00:33:50.896
I haven’t eaten anything all day long.

00:33:51.132 --> 00:33:53.607
I had to do all those chores you listed.

00:33:53.955 --> 00:33:57.004
Do you understand me now?

00:33:59.562 --> 00:34:02.354
Will you stop fussing about my eating from now on?

00:34:04.395 --> 00:34:06.495
So what do I have to do tomorrow?

00:34:08.206 --> 00:34:09.481
I must be at the hotel, right?

00:34:10.879 --> 00:34:11.954
How did you know?

00:34:12.691 --> 00:34:14.266
Chef Phat told me.

00:34:15.578 --> 00:34:16.953
You have an appointment with him, haven’t you?

00:34:18.955 --> 00:34:20.530
How did you know that from Chef Phat?

00:34:22.291 --> 00:34:23.791
He came to the store.

00:34:23.995 --> 00:34:27.294
He also told me that you went to see him too.

00:34:28.732 --> 00:34:31.881
What was that about, Korn? Did you warn him about something?

00:34:33.785 --> 00:34:35.310
Is there anything you're scared I'll find out?

00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.385
Scared of what? Why do I have to be scared?

00:34:40.197 --> 00:34:44.171
I just go there for my usual baking class. Nothing else.

00:34:44.474 --> 00:34:45.575
Nothing else?

00:34:46.150 --> 00:34:47.049
Yes.

00:34:52.708 --> 00:34:54.058
I’ll give you another chance.

00:34:54.301 --> 00:34:57.151
Confess the truth to me now. I won’t be mad.

00:34:58.072 --> 00:35:00.972
What to confess? There’s really nothing.

00:35:02.188 --> 00:35:04.714
So I can go to see Chef Phat as planned, right?

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.605
By all means. I’ll go with you too.

00:35:07.605 --> 00:35:10.675
So you’ll realize that there’s nothing going on between me and Chef Phat.

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:13.282
You stay here. I’ll be fine on my own.

00:35:13.282 --> 00:35:15.517
I’m fine to go with you.

00:35:15.517 --> 00:35:17.926
You don’t know how to bake. He might be perplexed.

00:35:20.625 --> 00:35:23.600
(I'll go with him. It’s easier to manage the situation.)

00:35:23.976 --> 00:35:27.325
(If he goes, he’ll try to cover things up.)

00:35:34.218 --> 00:35:35.368
Hi, Korn.

00:35:37.954 --> 00:35:39.035
You brought Win here too?

00:35:39.485 --> 00:35:42.034
He’s my boyfriend. Why can’t I bring him here?

00:35:44.434 --> 00:35:47.583
Come on. I heard all about it.

00:35:47.970 --> 00:35:48.967
That’s why I’m here.

00:35:49.154 --> 00:35:50.594
I told you not to speak a word.

00:35:52.407 --> 00:35:55.034
Chef Phat, you can go.

00:35:55.409 --> 00:35:57.274
Korn will teach me how to bake today.

00:35:57.274 --> 00:35:59.664
What? What does that mean?

00:35:59.765 --> 00:36:02.265
It means Win has found out.

00:36:02.366 --> 00:36:05.314
If you have anything to say to him, go ahead.

00:36:07.546 --> 00:36:08.434
(Don’t.)

00:36:10.522 --> 00:36:11.223
Well I…

00:36:11.223 --> 00:36:15.034
Hey. I told you not to let him know.

00:36:15.034 --> 00:36:15.936
Why did you tell him that?

00:36:16.229 --> 00:36:17.329
Why can’t he let me know?

00:36:17.841 --> 00:36:19.541
You don’t need to know.

00:36:19.541 --> 00:36:21.053
So you are keeping a secret from me?

00:36:21.912 --> 00:36:24.337
No. There’s no secret.

00:36:24.337 --> 00:36:26.418
What about this? You are clearly keeping something from me.

00:36:26.598 --> 00:36:27.702
Just tell me what it is.

00:36:27.702 --> 00:36:28.773
There’s no secret.

00:36:28.773 --> 00:36:29.385
I don’t believe you.

00:36:29.385 --> 00:36:30.417
Hold up.

00:36:30.417 --> 00:36:31.754
What are you two talking about?

00:36:31.754 --> 00:36:32.765
Stay out of this!

00:36:34.614 --> 00:36:35.425
Okay.

00:36:35.425 --> 00:36:38.113
I’ll leave you two alone to sort it out.

00:36:38.388 --> 00:36:39.831
I have something to sort out too.

00:36:40.388 --> 00:36:41.145
Bye.

00:36:49.395 --> 00:36:50.895
You are keeping a secret from me, right?

00:36:50.936 --> 00:36:53.074
I have to be here to get that out from you.

00:36:53.228 --> 00:36:55.503
Keep your curiosity with you for now.

00:36:55.913 --> 00:36:57.263
And help me bake.

00:36:57.475 --> 00:36:58.725
Why do I have to?

00:37:00.645 --> 00:37:02.170
After we finish baking,

00:37:02.432 --> 00:37:05.007
I promise I'll tell you everything.

00:37:06.148 --> 00:37:08.423
Fine. I’ll help.

00:37:08.565 --> 00:37:11.939
But if you don't tell me the truth, you're done.

00:37:13.856 --> 00:37:14.651
Okay.

00:37:16.975 --> 00:37:17.680
- Ready?
- Ready?

00:37:20.210 --> 00:37:21.860
Okay. We have everything we need.

00:37:24.321 --> 00:37:25.396
Where’s sugar?

00:37:25.594 --> 00:37:26.994
We’re not gonna use it.

00:37:27.435 --> 00:37:28.958
Cake without sugar?

00:37:29.458 --> 00:37:31.009
Do you really know how to bake a cake?

00:37:31.946 --> 00:37:34.621
We will not use sugar in our cake today.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:36.449
Is it going to be tasty?

00:37:36.824 --> 00:37:37.860
Of course, it is.

00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.394
Sugar isn't always required to make tasty meals.

00:37:40.394 --> 00:37:41.773
Plus, it’ll be beneficial for your health.

00:37:44.191 --> 00:37:50.514
We will be making healthy Japanese Matcha Crepe Cake with fudge topping

00:37:50.515 --> 00:37:52.215
with zero sugar.

00:37:53.779 --> 00:37:56.404
We’ll start with the wet ingredients first.

00:37:56.404 --> 00:38:00.687
Mix milk and Oishi Honey Lemon 0% sugar.

00:38:02.554 --> 00:38:04.054
Just half of the bottle.

00:38:04.239 --> 00:38:05.024
Only half?

00:38:05.024 --> 00:38:05.794
Yes.

00:38:09.765 --> 00:38:10.585
Done.

00:38:10.585 --> 00:38:11.765
Add oil in.

00:38:12.406 --> 00:38:14.256
Like this?

00:38:23.226 --> 00:38:23.991
What are you looking at?

00:38:24.394 --> 00:38:25.629
The cake.

00:38:31.514 --> 00:38:32.441
Isn’t it cute?

00:38:33.634 --> 00:38:35.182
Let me try it too.

00:38:35.182 --> 00:38:36.266
Go ahead.

00:38:36.721 --> 00:38:37.996
Try it.

00:38:40.438 --> 00:38:42.034
You broke the yolk.

00:38:42.034 --> 00:38:44.605
I have heavy hands and feet.

00:38:45.116 --> 00:38:46.816
I can’t do this kind of thing. It’s too difficult.

00:38:47.406 --> 00:38:50.081
Don’t worry. People with strong hands can also achieve this.

00:38:50.081 --> 00:38:51.148
There are many other ways to separate egg yolks.

00:38:51.317 --> 00:38:52.917
I’ll show you how to do it.

00:38:54.339 --> 00:38:57.538
Use an empty bottle of Oishi Honey Lemon 0% sugar.

00:38:57.895 --> 00:39:00.570
And pick up the egg yolk.

00:39:01.497 --> 00:39:02.269
Wow.

00:39:03.019 --> 00:39:04.247
Here it is.

00:39:05.592 --> 00:39:07.592
And drop it in the bowl.

00:39:09.524 --> 00:39:11.774
There’s an easy way to do it. You should have told me sooner.

00:39:11.774 --> 00:39:13.185
This method was discovered a long time ago.

00:39:13.185 --> 00:39:14.634
Go ahead. Do as I have shown you.

00:39:14.634 --> 00:39:15.329
Here we go.

00:39:22.475 --> 00:39:24.030
Let me help.

00:39:24.644 --> 00:39:25.969
Okay.

00:39:29.374 --> 00:39:31.174
I can do it.

00:39:31.174 --> 00:39:31.759
Very good.

00:39:32.352 --> 00:39:33.952
See? You can also do it.

00:39:46.108 --> 00:39:47.055
Wait, Korn.

00:39:49.129 --> 00:39:50.794
What are you doing with our cake?

00:39:51.635 --> 00:39:53.210
Didn’t you want to hear the truth?

00:39:55.196 --> 00:39:56.821
The truth is…

00:39:57.433 --> 00:39:59.433
I have an agreement with Chef Phat here on the hotel’s rooftop.

00:39:59.765 --> 00:40:02.249
Seriously, Korn.

00:40:02.774 --> 00:40:04.164
Take it easy, Win.

00:40:06.977 --> 00:40:08.927
I have a reason.

00:40:10.041 --> 00:40:11.409
And the reason is…

00:40:13.908 --> 00:40:14.815
you.

00:40:44.674 --> 00:40:45.674
Come.

00:40:54.227 --> 00:40:56.227
Today is our 2nd year anniversary.

00:40:56.976 --> 00:40:57.863
You forgot it, right?

00:41:01.886 --> 00:41:03.474
My mind has been preoccupied with something else.

00:41:04.912 --> 00:41:05.766
This is it.

00:41:06.241 --> 00:41:07.737
The secret between me and Chef Phat.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.585
Oh. This?

00:41:17.782 --> 00:41:18.577
Sit down.

00:41:35.972 --> 00:41:40.246
I want to create a cake recipe for you only.

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:45.634
I know that you like desserts.

00:41:46.748 --> 00:41:49.673
But I’m worried about your health.

00:41:50.693 --> 00:41:53.792
So I created a cake recipe that is good for you

00:41:54.669 --> 00:41:56.669
and for my own heart.

00:42:06.394 --> 00:42:08.169
You should have let me know properly.

00:42:09.256 --> 00:42:11.031
Instead, you said things that got on my nerves.

00:42:12.717 --> 00:42:14.717
I didn’t intend to make you feel that way.

00:42:15.495 --> 00:42:18.894
I just wanted you to eat healthily and be healthy.

00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:26.124
I want you to stay as long as possible with me.

00:42:34.142 --> 00:42:35.103
I…

00:42:39.351 --> 00:42:40.665
I’m sorry.

00:42:43.615 --> 00:42:45.415
I doubted you with Chef Phat.

00:42:49.655 --> 00:42:50.505
I…

00:42:52.054 --> 00:42:54.004
I'm probably too exhausted and have lost myself.

00:42:55.795 --> 00:42:57.270
I should not have acted like that with you.

00:42:58.627 --> 00:43:01.002
I want to apologize to you too.

00:43:02.303 --> 00:43:04.703
I was so busy working that I didn't have time for you.

00:43:06.123 --> 00:43:07.898
You have to move in to stay with me instead.

00:43:08.824 --> 00:43:10.824
You can't take care of Warodom Farm,

00:43:12.034 --> 00:43:13.609
and choose to take care of me.

00:43:17.053 --> 00:43:18.167
Good that you know.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:25.794
And I also apologize

00:43:27.191 --> 00:43:31.240
for stopping you from eating what you like to eat.

00:43:36.001 --> 00:43:38.001
I know that you are really tired.

00:43:38.854 --> 00:43:46.076
Now that I’m in your body, I truly understand you now.

00:43:47.827 --> 00:43:49.577
Will you stop me from eating again?

00:43:51.478 --> 00:43:52.321
I won’t.

00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:58.625
From now on, I will find you only delicious and healthy stuff for you every day.

00:43:59.150 --> 00:43:59.907
How does this sound?

00:44:01.881 --> 00:44:02.889
I’m hungry now.

00:44:04.713 --> 00:44:05.630
Can I eat?

00:44:07.229 --> 00:44:07.907
Go ahead.

00:44:16.634 --> 00:44:19.933
Whose boyfriend is this? Why is he so cute?

00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:24.480
Eat the cake, not my fingers.

00:44:27.154 --> 00:44:27.904
Dig in.

00:44:30.794 --> 00:44:31.516
How is it?

00:44:32.677 --> 00:44:33.462
It’s good.

00:44:34.394 --> 00:44:38.732
This is a healthy dessert.

00:44:39.181 --> 00:44:39.896
Korn.

00:44:39.896 --> 00:44:40.794
Hm?

00:44:43.097 --> 00:44:44.372
How lovely of you.

00:44:47.533 --> 00:44:48.409
Oh, you’re not.

00:45:09.082 --> 00:45:10.031
Korn.

00:45:10.394 --> 00:45:11.445
Korn.

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:15.470
Your arm is on my neck.

00:45:15.916 --> 00:45:16.756
It’s heavy.

00:45:17.274 --> 00:45:20.058
Sorry. Can I hold you like this a little longer?

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:39.160
Korn!!!

00:45:39.517 --> 00:45:40.657
What?

00:45:40.657 --> 00:45:42.991
We have returned to our own bodies!

00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:44.885
Really?

00:45:44.885 --> 00:45:45.994
Yes. Look.

00:45:47.912 --> 00:45:49.187
It’s true.

00:45:51.159 --> 00:45:54.084
If our love hadn't fallen to zero before,

00:45:54.174 --> 00:45:57.698
we wouldn't have realized how good our love is now.

00:45:58.343 --> 00:45:59.443
I can’t breathe.
