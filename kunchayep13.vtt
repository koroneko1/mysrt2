00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But don't worry about me. 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Jiu is a good man. He won't harm me. 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.000
Jiu is deceiving you.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Jiu is a subordinate of …

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.000
Tian, let's go. 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.000
Pin, please give it to Yang.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.600
Let's go.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:25.200
Tian, listen to me first. 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.000
Sorry, Madam. / Tian!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Yang, Tian gave me a letter.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I just realize now when you said

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Tian would never be able to love me. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
If this secret is revealed, 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Mr. Ma will use this as an excuse to inherit the title of the Five Dragons Association's head. 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.000
That's why he sent Jiu to deceive Tian. 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.000
About finding Jiu's hiding place, now we know where the two of them are.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.000
Take me there right now.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Tian, are you back?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Bua, please meet me at the shrine next to the market tomorrow night.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.000
Don't let anyone know.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.000
Mr. Tian's letter.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Bua and Yang discussed something?

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.000
Yes, Madam. Should we call Bua to ask?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Bua, 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Yang didn’t come with you?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Mother.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
How did you get here?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
How about Bua and Yang?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Jia has anesthetized them. 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
They should be asleep now.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Bua, do you smell anything?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
What smell?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Bua.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Bua.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Tian. 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Mother.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
How could you do this?

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
If I didn't do this, how would I know what you were thinking?

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.000
When something happened, you cried for Bua and your brother Yang to help you.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Have you ever thought how would I feel?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000
And if I ask you to help me, 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
will you help me?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Then I ask you.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Can you me go to live with Jiu?

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.000
No. 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000
Knowing that her child is walking on the path to hell, 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.000
no mother still let him go.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Even if it's hell, I still want to go.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
I want to be with the person I love.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I love him.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000
I love him, Mother.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Mother, did you hear that? I love him.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Mother.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Mother.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
I really love him.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
I never thought before that in this life, 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000
I would meet someone I love and he loves me as well. 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Please let me go to be with the one I love.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Let us go, please.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Please, I beg you. 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Please.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Do you really think that this guy really loves you?

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
You don't even realize that you're being deceived.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
What do you mean?

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000
He is Mr. Ma's subordinate?

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Ma teams up with Chan to send him to find out your secret.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000
The whole thing that happened was their plan.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
He doesn't really love you. 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000
That's not true.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Not true.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000
You're lying. 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Everything I said is true.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000
No one in this world will love someone like you.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Everyone comes to deceive you for benefit.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
There is only me who loves you. 

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
This mother who you hate so much and want to run away.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000
That's not true.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000
It's not true. I don't believe it.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Jiu must not be someone like that.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Come home with me, Tian. Okay?

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Come home with me.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Jiu is not that kind of guy, Mother.

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:19.000
Tian. 

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:20.000
Jiu is not that kind of guy.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.000
Tian, go home with me.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000
I don't believe you. You're lying.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.000
Tian. 

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:26.000
You lie to me. No way. 

00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:27.000
Tian. 

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Tian. 

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Tian, are you back?

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Mr. Ma. 

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Where is Tian?

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.000
He's not here. I am alone.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.000
You're lying. 

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.000
You just called him now.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Sir. 

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
You sent me to the Song family to find out Tian's secret

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
so that you can expose that secret and take up the position instead and that's it, right?

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
If that's all, don't worry.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000
I'm going to pick up my siblings and leave this place along with Tian as soon as possible.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
What do you mean?

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000
We're almost there, Sir. 

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Listen carefully.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Today we have to bring Tian back home.

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:33.000
If anyone interferes, whether it's Jiu or Ma, 

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000
kill them. 

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.000
You didn't fool me

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
that Tian wouldn't come back and interfere with the Association again, right?

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Tian and I have already talked, Sir. 

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Don't worry.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000
He might just say that to buy the time

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000
or find a way out to get away. 

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Don't believe him. 

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:14.000
I believe you, 

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
but I don't trust Tian.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000
There's no guarantee that he won't change his mind.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
In the past, you did everything well.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:28.000
But from now on, don't get in my way anymore.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Gui.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.000
You wait for Tian to come back

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000
and finish this.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Tian, dodge.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Didn't we agree that I'll take Tian with me and leave here?

00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Why are you doing this?

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000
And what is the reason for him to give up everything and run away with you?

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:09.000
You couldn't tell me Tian's secret.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
I will kill him myself.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Tian's secret

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.000
is that…

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.000
He doesn't like women.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000
What do you say?

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.000
He doesn't like women.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Like Zhang?

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Then how did you know that?

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Don't tell me that…

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Now he must be very fond of you that he is brave enough to run away with you. 

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.000
No matter what you say, he will believe you, right?

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
You're really awesome.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.000
I will triple your money.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.000
He doesn't like women.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Tian, if you don't want to go home now, 

00:14:58.000 --> 00:14:59.000
we can stay here for the time being.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I'll sell candy sugar sculpture again, 

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
or find something for sale. 

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Once we get some money, we can move to another place.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000
Is it hard to be with me?

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.000
I'm sorry that I can't take good care of you.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000
I promise I'll try to take better care of you.

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Don't leave me, okay?

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Dad, Mom. 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.000
Today I bring my lover to pay respects to you. 

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Tian is a member of our family now.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000
Now I don't have to be alone.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
He is taking care of me.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000
His hut is over there, Sir. 

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Get ready.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000
Get Tian out of that. 

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000
Stop!

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Father.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Tian. 

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000
Tian. 

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Tian. 

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Tian, Tian, Tian.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
What did Jiu do?

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Did he hurt you? Tell me.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Hey, get Jiu.

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
No, please. No. Don't hurt Jiu.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.000
Don't hurt him. 

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Father, please take me home.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Tian. 

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Tian. 

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Tian, Tian.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Tian. 

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
If Mr. Yang doesn't go out, he will probably stay at Bua's house.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Bua, is my son with you?

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000
Bua, Yang. 

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Why is it so quiet?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:24.000
I don't know either. 

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Bua, Yang. 

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Yang.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.000
Why does it unlock?

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Yang.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Yang, my son.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.000
Yang, Yang.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.000
What happened?

00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:42.000
Yang.

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:43.665
Is he dead?

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000
Nuan, bitch. Are you cursing my child?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:49.000
Yang, Yang.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.000
No, he's not dead yet. No. 

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
You check Bua. Hurry.

00:19:56.300 --> 00:19:57.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.000
Yang, Yang. 

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.000
Yang.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
I was shocked. She's fine.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.000
Just sleeping. If she's sleepy, why doesn't she go to bed properly?

00:20:08.300 --> 00:20:10.000
You bitch.

00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:13.000
I scream so loud but they haven't woken up yet. Do you think they're asleep?

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Get a damp cloth quickly.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.000
Yang, baby. 

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000
Yang, Yang. 

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Yang. 

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Yang, Yang. 

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:32.000
Wake up.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:34.000
Yang, Yang. 

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.000
Bua.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Are you alright?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Mom.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.000
How are you?

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Bua. Take care of her. 

00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000
What happened?

00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.000
Why are you sleeping like this?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Mr. Yang, you'd better wait outside. I'll close them myself.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000
It's okay. I'll help you.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000
What's that smell? Can you smell it?

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.000
What smell?

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Bua.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Bua.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
You smelled something strange and then fainted?

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.000
Jia. 

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Madam. 

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000
How was it going?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000
And where is Mr. Tian?

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000
Jia. 

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
You're here. You gave my child anesthesia, didn't you?

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.000
Right?

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.000
What are you talking about? I don't know.

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.000
Don't pretend you don't know. 

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:31.000
What evil plan are you up to?

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000
Or because Tian is gone, so you're afraid that my Yang will replace him?

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Mom, calm down.

00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:41.800
I can't. 

00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:42.400
Mom. 

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:46.000
If I didn't find you there, you and Bua must have been killed by now. 

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.000
Right?

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Right?

00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Li. 

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.000
Tian. 

00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:01.000
Li. 

00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.000
Tian. 

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Tian. 

00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.000
I brought our son back. / Tian.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.000
How are you?

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Tian. 

00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:11.000
Li. 

00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:15.000
Tian. Let's take him to his room first. Let's discuss about others later.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.000
Go. Hurry up. Go. 

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:18.000
Tian. 

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Mr. Tian is back. What should we do?

00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.000
I thought that Jiu murdered him in the forest already. 

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Why did he let him go?

00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:42.000
Tian. 

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Where are you? Why haven't you come back yet?

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Tian. 

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:17.000
Tian. 

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Tian. 

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Tian. 

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Tian. 

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Tian. 

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Tian. 

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Should we expose about Tian today?

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.000
Not yet. 

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
We won't expose that Tian is homosexual right now.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Because Big Brother will distort the fact to let his son get away with it. 

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000
In the next five days, 

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
the Five Dragons Association will have a general meeting.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000
We'll expose on that day that his son was a homosexual pervert just like Zhang.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Tian probably couldn't stand it.

00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.000
He'll be ashamed and slit his throat to end his life like him that day. 

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000
The Song family must be disgraced. 

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:06.000
and everything must belong to me. 

00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:08.000
You're really smart.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
We'll need to keep Jiu close to us

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:16.000
so that he could be our witness to expose Tian.

00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:19.000
But if he doesn't agree, will use his siblings to threaten him.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
He will obey us for sure.

00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Doctor, how is Tian?

00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000
He has pneumonia， 

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.000
respiratory tract infection, and high fever.

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.000
Quite critical. 

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Is it serious?

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000
This is war time, the medicines are hard to find.

00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.000
Mr. Tian's health is not very healthy.

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000
We must be careful to avoid complications.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000
He need a lot of rest as well. 

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.000
Jia, send the doctor off. 

00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Tian. 

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000
How are you?

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Don't be afraid anymore.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Jiu can't harm you. 

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000
You are like this because of him, right?

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.000
Father. 

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000
What did he do?

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000
I'm tired.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Then get some rest. Don't say anything yet.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Have a lot of sleep. 

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Tian. 

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000
Father. 

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
I'm tired of hiding everything.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000
In fact...

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Tian. 

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Tian, don't talk anymore.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Have a rest. 

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Li. 

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Tian is about to tell me the truth.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
There is no such truth.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.000
He is sick, so he may say something funny. Please stop forcing him to say a thing. 

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.000
I didn't force him. 

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:37.000
He is telling me something important. Why did you intervene?

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.000
And is it the right time?

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000
He is sick. The doctor had just warned us to let him take a lot of rest.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Please don't bother him.

00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Tian. 

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000
Tian. 

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Bao, where is Tian?

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Did you guys capture Tian? Return him to me. 

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000
If Jiu isn't willing to be our witness that Tian is a homosexual, 

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
we use his sister to threaten him.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:41.000
But the girl who had escaped might already be dead, Sir. 

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000
But we still have another brother.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Or does Big Brother already know about it?

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
So he sent Bao to kill Jiu. 

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Put the scissors down. 

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.000
I told you to put down the scissors.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Quickly. 

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Get him. 

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.000
You die.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.000
What?

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Jiu. 

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.000
Follow him.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:50.000
Jiu. 

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Where did he go?

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Hey, over there.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Mr. Song sent people to kill for me like this. 

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Tian must have been captured.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000
I think it was really Aunt Jia who anesthetized us.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000
But why did she do it?

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Maybe Madam Li knew about Tian's letter.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
I think we should wait to ask Tian. He might know about it. 

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
But, I'm wondering about one thing. 

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000
What's the matter?

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Jiu took Tian away for several days, but he didn't harm him.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
The relationship between these two is strange.

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Do you know why?

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Yang.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
If you know anything, tell me. So I can help you.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
So what happened actually?

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Yang, you know about it, right?

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
It's about Tian's secret, right?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.000
I know about it. 

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
But I can't speak.

00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.000
Yang.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:41.000
Bua.

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000
But don't worry. 

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Tian's secret is not about good or bad.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000
He is still our original good guy. 

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.000
But can you not pay attention to this matter?

00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Please.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Did Yang know about Tian and Jiu?

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.000
He said that he did, Madam. 

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000
We have to kill him. We can't just let him go.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Jia. 

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.000
But that's Yang.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Although he is Chan's son, 

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:39.000
he loves Tian and is nice to Tian since they were young.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:45.000
At first, I thought that I would kill only Dong.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
But later, there were more people dying. 

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Doctor Qi as well. 

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Do we have to do that to Yang too?

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
The two of us have gone too deep.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:03.000
I'm scared. 

00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Madam. 

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.000
Oh, I'm not afraid of being caught.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:26.000
But I'm afraid that my karma will get back to my son instead.

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.000
The other day, Mr. Song brought Mr. Tian back home, madam.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:43.000
But he was very ill and became delirious due to fever.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:45.000
So I still don't know what was going on. 

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Mad, find a place to hide.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000
What happened?

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Nothing. 

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Gui is angry in place me.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Thinking that you have passed the news to Big Brother

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000
and encourage him to misunderstand me. 

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Did you do it?

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Ma.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000
I have to take care of the teahouse business to survive each day.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
I don't have time to do other things.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
If you didn't do it, that's good.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
But next time, if you're going to do anything, think about it thoroughly. 

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Listen to me. 

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
The head title of the Five Dragons Association

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000
is not tied to the Song family forever.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.000
What do you mean?

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.000
You'll know.

00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.000
Let's just say this time, I will give you a chance.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000
Your people have eyes and ears around. 

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Go find out where Jiu is. 

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Find him before the association meeting day and report to me.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Big Brother can't know about this.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Otherwise, your teahouse will be nothing but ashes left. 

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Yes.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Madam. 

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Why is Mr. Ma searching for Jiu?

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000
I don't know. 

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Ma is protecting his subordinate?

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Probably not.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
A guy like him has never shown kindness to anyone.

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:31.000
He must have a plan.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
I think Jiu is not normal.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000
Mr. Song is also searching for Jiu right now.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
If he finds Jiu first, I'll you immediately.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Both Big Brother and Ma want Jiu. 

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000
If we get Jiu before everyone, 

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
he must be useful to us, Mud. 

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.000
Yes, Madam. 

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Do you really think that this guy really loves you?

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:55.000
You don't even realize that you're being deceived.

00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000
What do you mean?

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000
He is Mr. Ma's subordinate?

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:08.000
He doesn't like women.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000
He doesn't like women.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Like Zhang?

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
I will triple your money.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000
How are you, Tian?

00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000
You need to get well soon.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Do you know when you're not at home?

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000
I don't have anyone to talk to.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Don't you want to know where I have been?

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000
Or what happened?

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Just forget it. 

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Now I got my brother back.

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.000
I'm so happy now.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Do you want something to eat?

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Okay, I'll tell Bua to make your favorite dish. 

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.000
So you'll get well soon.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:34.000
I'll be right back. 

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Yang, why did you come back so fast?

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000
Tian. 

00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:07.000
Jiu.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.000
How are you?

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000
What happened to you that night?

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Why did your father bring you back?

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.000
We better run away from here. Someone will see us. Let's go. 

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Tian. 

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000
What's wrong?

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000
I know the truth. 

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000
You are Mr. Ma's subordinate.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Tian, I'm sorry.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
I'm sorry I didn't tell you. 

00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.000
Let me explain, Tian. 

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Tian. 

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Tian. 

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Tian. 

00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.200
Jiu.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Jiu, come here.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Tian. 

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Do you dare to trespass to hurt Tian at home?

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:16.000
Anyone here, come catch him.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Yang.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:27.000
Let's hurry up. / Tian.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000
Yang. / Tian. 

00:48:29.300 --> 00:48:30.000
Are you alright, Yang? / Get out. 

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Tian, let's go. 

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Jiu.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:41.000
What are you doing?

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Tian, we don't have time.

00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.000
Let me explain everything to you.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Let me go. 

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.000
I already know.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
A scum like you do everything for money.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000
For your own benefit.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000
No, it's not. 

00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:08.000
Tian, listen to me first.

00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Tian. 

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Go away. 

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Jiu.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:17.000
You're liar.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Don't let me see your face again.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
No, Tian, come with me.

00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:27.000
Go.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Let's go, Tian. 

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.000
Let him go. What are you doing?

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000
There's no time. / Just go. 

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Don't hurt Mr. Tian. / Tian. 

00:49:36.300 --> 00:49:37.000
Go, go!

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000
Stop!

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Stop!

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Hey, I said stop.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Hey, catch him. 

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Hurry up and catch him. 

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Stop. Follow him.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Don't run away.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Hey, stop!

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Follow him quickly. 

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Stop!

00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Hurry. 

00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:50.000
Get him. 

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:50.900
Don't run away.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Sir, Jiu get in here.

00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Stop, Jiu. 

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Jiu got in to see Mr. Tian. The workers are now chasing him.

00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:28.000
If they get him, Mr. Tian's secret must be revealed.

00:53:28.300 --> 00:53:29.000
We have to kill him first. 

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000
I've prepared everything, Madam. 

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Kill Jiu before he spills Tian's secret.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.000
Tian's secret?

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Are they going to kill Jiu to cover up?

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Look around.

00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Go over there.

00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Who are you?

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
What are they doing?

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:35.000
And what is that little box?

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.000
I'm with you now. How am I supposed to know?

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000
What kind of powder is that, or...

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Is it poison?

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Poison.

00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Or is this the thing that killed Dong?

00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:46.000
They're going to kill Jiu soon, Madam.

00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:50.000
If he dies, no one will expose Tian.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:52.000
What shall we do?

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Sir, Sir. 

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:03.000
This way.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Be careful.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Sir. 

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Who are you?

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.000
Li. 

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Hey!

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Jiu.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Madam Li and Jia were killing Jiu. I saw it with my own eyes.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Is it true?

00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:50.000
I didn't kill anyone.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:54.000
I've heard that Jiu got in here.

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.000
So I'm going to help catch him.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Then why did you dress like this?

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:02.000
Right. 

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Not only dressing weirdly, 

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000
but you also covered yourself.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:12.000
If you aren't killing someone, why do you cover your body like you're afraid other people will see you?

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Catching a culprit, if I wear what I wear at home, 

00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000
how can I run after him?

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Don't believe her, Sir. She's lying.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Before going to kill Jiu, 

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
I overheard Madam talking to Jia.

00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:33.000
She said Jiu knew about Tian's secret, so she needed to kill him to hide the truth.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:34.000
Right, Nuan?

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.000
Yes, Sir. 

00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:39.400
And I also saw that Madam Li and Jia threw a kind of powder to Jiu.
Nonsense, liar.

00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.000
When it touched Jiu, he cried out.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
This powder must be the powder that was used to kill Dong. 

00:58:53.700 --> 00:58:55.000
Jia and I were going to catch Jiu.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
But you, Chan, you stopped us from catching him.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000
Why did you do that?

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Don't change the topic. 

00:59:07.400 --> 00:59:08.000
Why did I help him?

00:59:08.700 --> 00:59:10.000
Because he's Mr. Ma's subordinate.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000
You're afraid that if Jiu was caught, he would expose you. 

00:59:14.300 --> 00:59:15.000
That's not true!

00:59:43.000 --> 00:59:46.000
Our people have been searching for Jiu everywhere, but didn't find him. 

00:59:50.000 --> 00:59:51.000
We have a lot of people. 

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:56.000
But we can't even find him. 

00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:58.000
That upsets me.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:03.000
And who do you believe?

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Madam Li or Madam Chan. 

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:08.000
I don't believe both.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000
What should I do?

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
How can I know what happened exactly?

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000
What is Tian's secret?

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.000
I will hurry to find Jiu. 

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000
If we catch him, things will become clearer.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Yang.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:55.000
How is Jiu?

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
He could run away. 

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.000
I'm sorry, Yang. 

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
I got you into trouble again.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.000
I'm fine.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Really. Get some rest.

01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.100
Yang.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Actually…

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Jiu and I…

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000
We are…

01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:35.000
I know that/ 

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Don't say anything.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Do you know about it?

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.000
Do you think…

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Do you think I'm stupid?

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:15.000
I'm like a fool

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
for thinking that someone would love me

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:23.000
even though...

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000
I don't deserve real love.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Tian. 

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Listen to me. 

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:40.000
Don't think like that.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Don't blame yourself.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000
Everything that happened wasn't your fault.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000
You're just unlucky that you fell in love with the wrong guy. 

01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Loving someone who deceived you for benefits.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
He's bad.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
It's not that you're not worthy of a good love.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Tian. 

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.000
For me,

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.000
you are a very good brother.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
You're considerate.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
And most importantly, you are the person I love

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000
and I want my loved one to be the happiest.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
If you think that no one loves you, 

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000
I want you to know that

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.000
I love you.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.000
And I will always be beside you, brother. 

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Madam. 

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Chan saw us using the orchid.

01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:17.000
Yang also know about Mr. Tian's secret.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000
If we leave them, they must be a threat to us in the future.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:23.000
What should we do?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Mr. Song is watching us now. 

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:29.000
If Yang or Chan is dead or disappears, 

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000
Mr. Song definitely won't let this matter quiet. 

01:04:32.700 --> 01:04:34.000
But anyway, we have to find a way to kill them. 

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Tonight, 

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
you lure Yang to the back of the house.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:05.000
Then use the orchid to kill him.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.000
How about Madam Chan?

01:05:11.000 --> 01:05:13.000
When Yang disappears, 

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000
she will probably look for him.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:19.000
We will kill her by then.

01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000
And when the other two are gone, 

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:26.000
we will claim that they run away because of guilt

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:28.000
siding with Mr. Ma.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Aunt Jia.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Didn't you say that Tian want to talk to me?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:41.000
And where is him?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Wait a minute, Mr. Tian is coming.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.000
The wind direction is just right.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
Aunt Jia, what is this?

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000
I think I'd better meet him at his room.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Mr. Yang.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Mr. Tian.

01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.000
Tian. 

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Tian. 

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
What are you doing?

01:07:03.300 --> 01:07:04.000
Come here.

01:07:04.200 --> 01:07:05.000
Tian. 

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:06.000
Go wash your hands. / Tian.

01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:07.000
Tian. 

01:07:07.300 --> 01:07:08.000
Get out.

01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.000
No.

01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.000
Wash your hands.

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.000
Hurry up, Madam. / Right now.

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.000
What are you doing? Huh?

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:53.000
How is it? Is it in time?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Yes. 

01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:57.000
Fortunately, Mr. Tian did not inhale the dust. 

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000
What did you do?

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000
You ordered Aunt Jia to kill Yang?

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000
This is too much, Mother. 

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:09.000
I need to do it. Yang knew all. 

01:08:09.300 --> 01:08:10.000
If anything happens to Yang. 

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.000
you prepare a funeral for me. 

01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:14.000
Tian. 

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Don't say that. 

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:17.100
Madam didn't want to do it.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.000
She herself was very sad.

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000
You knew why she had to do it.

01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.000
I know. 

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000
But couldn't you do that?

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:32.000
Can you stop this? I beg you.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000
Yes. 

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000
So,

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.000
on the association meeting day, you have to announce your marriage.

01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:46.100
I will find you a woman.

01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000
Get married and take the position of the leader. 

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.000
It's too late, Mother. 

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.000
Jiu told Mr. Ma already.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000
That I am a homosexual.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:11.000
What?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000
You still insist that I should announce the marriage?

01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:12.000
If you do everything as I said, everyone will be safe.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.000
Look at this first. 

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:17.000
Sir. 

01:10:17.200 --> 01:10:18.000
Sir. 

01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.000
Tian's secret.

01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000
Catch him.
