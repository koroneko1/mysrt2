1
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,440
Rain, wake up.

2
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,820
- What time is it now?
- 8.15.

3
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:37,960
No matter how hard you cry,
I won't accept your work.

4
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:39,910
Why am I here?

5
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:40,979
P' Payu.

6
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,110
Dry your hair properly.
Don't get sick.

7
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,340
I don't wanna take care of you.

8
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:05,740
How’s your boy?

9
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:07,090
Better.

10
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:11,420
Get someone to buy dinner for Rain.
He hasn’t eaten since yesterday.

11
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,270
Okay, leave it to me.

12
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,870
Payu.

13
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,950
P’ Pakin called just now.

14
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,950
Next month’s race schedule is out.

15
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:24,620
He said that you mustn’t
let another mistake happen.

16
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,350
Yeah, I understand.

17
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:32,350
I'll call him.

18
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:38,990
And he said that if the boy’s
naughty, just bring him along.

19
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,790
Not now.

20
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,500
Hey, what do you mean?
Payu! Payu!

21
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,000
- What are you looking at?
- The person who’s eating.

22
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,530
I know I’m eating, but I’m gonna
lose my appetite with your stare.

23
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,130
But you almost finish the food.

24
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,570
It’s because I’m hungry.

25
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:25,890
Seriously.

26
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:30,810
You're eating like a baby.
There's food on your mouth.

27
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,670
Just so you know,
I don’t date underage people.

28
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,030
I’m already 19.

29
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,890
Which means I can kiss you.

30
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,970
You already kissed me.

31
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,140
Does it count?
All I tasted was blood.

32
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,840
Then...

33
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,370
Kiss me again.

34
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:09,230
Rain.

35
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,850
Yes?

36
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,840
You shouldn’t come here anymore.

37
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:21,010
What do you mean?
Don’t joke like that.

38
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,000
You’re annoyed with me, right?

39
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:30,680
I know I’m annoying.
I’m sorry, I won’t bother you again.

40
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,230
I... I won’t sneak into
that racetrack again.

41
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,490
I won’t mess with you again.

42
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,130
But please don’t forbid
me from coming here.

43
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,350
Listen to me, Rain.

44
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:44,100
I’m not annoyed with you.

45
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,240
But…

46
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,110
Didn’t I tell you that I wanted
you to balance your time?

47
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:55,340
You’re only on your first year,
but what’s it gonna be after this?

48
00:04:56,450 --> 00:05:01,090
Before you design a house,
you need to design your life first.

49
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,170
And if you’re really
serious about pursuing me…

50
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:09,210
You need to understand that I don’t
want a spur-of-the-moment relationship.

51
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,480
If you can’t be responsible
for your own life...

52
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:18,440
How can I expect
a more serious relationship?

53
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,440
This is how I am.

54
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:31,040
If you can’t accept it,
then don’t come here again.

55
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:35,810
What if I can prove that
I can be responsible?

56
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,240
Can I come here again?

57
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,130
Not until you prove it to me.

58
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:45,270
But now, finish your dinner
and sleep over tonight.

59
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,980
I’ll send you home tomorrow.

60
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:08,640
Warm Me with Your Heart

61
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,460
The window’s position isn’t right.
It shouldn’t be here.

62
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,350
- Can’t I put it here?
- No.

63
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:21,630
See? It’s the wrong direction.
It's blocked.

64
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,610
It should be here.

65
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:28,480
P’ Som, you’re so eager
when it comes to your sister.

66
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,680
Of course, she’s my favorite little sister.

67
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:33,100
That's for sure.

68
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,310
What’s up, Rain?

69
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,720
What’s the matter?
You look pretty down.

70
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,010
It should be here.

71
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:52,610
Okay, I’ll redo it.

72
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,550
As you wish.

73
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,300
Cheer up.

74
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:11,210
I was recently scolded that a
kindergartener's more creative than me.

75
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,610
And look at me.
I’m still fine.

76
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,550
Alright, alright.
Think of it as an advice from a senior.

77
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:26,610
Set four alarm clocks and
place them in four corners.

78
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,450
Let’s see if that can’t wake you up.

79
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,710
But you still go back to sleep anyway.

80
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,950
Nonsense.

81
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,690
That’s not true.

82
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,920
Come on.

83
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:46,330
I’ll buy you lunch.

84
00:07:47,409 --> 00:07:48,520
Okay?

85
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,170
Are you okay?

86
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:54,490
I’m not hungry.
You go ahead.

87
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,040
Suit yourself.
Whatever floats your boat.

88
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:04,510
Rain, let’s have lunch together.

89
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,200
It’s not every day P’ Som
offers to spring for a meal.

90
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,640
Let’s go.

91
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,490
I’ve already eaten.
You should go with P’ Som.

92
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,790
Okay.

93
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,350
What about you?

94
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,240
I’ll be with you shortly.

95
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,130
Okay, suit yourself.

96
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,220
- Then we’ll be going first.
- Okay.

97
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:31,150
Okay, I’ll see you later.

98
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,820
Let’s go.

99
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:55,030
You don’t like Ple anymore, do you?

100
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:56,870
I still do.

101
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:03,150
They guy you’re trying to
win over is P’ Payu, right?

102
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:14,380
You’re not feeling down
from the teacher’s reproach.

103
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,300
You usually recover fast.

104
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,740
You’re like this because
of a different problem, right?

105
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:32,540
Rain, be honest with me.

106
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,910
Do you like P’ Payu?

107
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,230
I don’t.

108
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:43,310
Before you answered me...

109
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,460
Did you look into your heart?

110
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,460
Don’t worry.

111
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,140
You can take your time to think.

112
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,960
And tell me later when
you’re sure about it.

113
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,500
Because no one knows
your heart better than yourself.

114
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,550
Got it?

115
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,030
Goosebumps.

116
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,350
I’d never said something like this to you.

117
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,030
I’m leaving.

118
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,180
Hang in there.

119
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,000
I don’t know.

120
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,510
I just don’t wanna let you down.

121
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,430
- What’s wrong with you, Sig?
- Aren't you gonna work?

122
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,950
- Move your ass!
- Please go ahead.

123
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:16,710
See here?

124
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,510
I think there’s no need for a rooftop here.

125
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,950
Too easy.
Piece of cake.

126
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,760
- What’s your suggestion then?
- Your work’s finished?

127
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,350
- Easy.
- Finish your work first.

128
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,710
Easy?
You finished your work?

129
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,680
You’ll be short-lived if you sigh often.

130
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,750
Even so, I’ll still live
much longer than you.

131
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:22,930
So what’s the deal?
Lovers’ quarrel?

132
00:13:25,350 --> 00:13:26,630
We’re not yet a couple.

133
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,960
So my guess was right.
It’s really a love problem.

134
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,210
No wonder you’ve been gloomy all day.

135
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:37,330
So who’s this person?
Younger? Older?

136
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,790
Well…

137
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,900
Younger. A freshman.

138
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,720
You’re so bad.
So what’s the problem?

139
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,570
The problem is...

140
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,660
They're an architecture student.

141
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,410
I get it now.
Let me guess.

142
00:13:55,700 --> 00:14:01,530
Too busy to answer texts, go on
dates, and have meals together.

143
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:03,330
Let’s just break up.

144
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,550
Personal experience?

145
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,270
Yeah.

146
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,840
First one broke up with me on 2nd year.

147
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,240
Second one ditched me on 4th year
after we dated for only three months.

148
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:26,000
Before she left, she lectured me
about having no time for a relationship.

149
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:29,740
And that I was selfish,
focused only on my works.

150
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,930
Forget it, let’s talk about you.

151
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,060
You broke up with them
or the other way around?

152
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,310
It’s not like that.

153
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:46,530
By the way, what’s the progress
of Sathorn's house renovation?

154
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,300
Wow, what a sudden change of subject.

155
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:20,070
Those guys are sleeping like corpses.

156
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:22,990
Let’s wake them up in an hour.

157
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,360
Sky.

158
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,120
What?

159
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:40,390
Remember what we talked about last time?

160
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,830
I said that...

161
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,820
I wasn’t sure if I liked P’ Payu.

162
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,580
I still don’t know if I like him.

163
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,190
All I know is...

164
00:16:08,650 --> 00:16:10,000
I don’t wanna give up.

165
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,610
Rain, you know what?

166
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,740
Every time I say you’re annoying...

167
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,560
I never mean it.

168
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:32,910
Because you never give up easily.

169
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
And I like this side of you.

170
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,240
I wanna prove it to him.

171
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,100
Then what are you waiting for?

172
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,990
You’re right.

173
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,720
I’m the kind who acts fast.

174
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,770
Yeah.

175
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,590
He’ll never see my effort if I do nothing.

176
00:16:56,610 --> 00:16:57,790
That’s right.

177
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:03,900
I’m gonna prove to him that I can do it.

178
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,680
Way to go, buddy.

179
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:14,550
Thank you.

180
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,490
Don’t mention it.
No biggie.

181
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,560
Just buy me ice cream.

182
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,730
P’ Payu.

183
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,630
Sawasdee krub, everyone.

184
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,020
Sawasdee ka, Nong Rain.

185
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,060
Haven’t seen you in days.
You’ve been busy?

186
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,290
Sort of.

187
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:48,010
May I sit in the office?

188
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,510
You do it.

189
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,260
Me?

190
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:02,690
I’m sorry, Mr. Rain.
Boss doesn’t allow you to enter.

191
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,350
Then may I borrow a chair?

192
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:11,450
Sure.

193
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,820
- Here.
- Thank you.

194
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:26,640
It’s hot today.
You'll really let him sit outdoor?

195
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:32,400
It’s not that I don’t pity him.
But who’d dare go against Boss’ order?

196
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,430
If that person’s not you,
then it’s definitely not me.

197
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,640
Let’s get back to work.

198
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,380
Didn't I tell you not to come here?

199
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,130
I just wanted a change of scenery.

200
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,960
Then go to a café or the faculty.

201
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,910
I promise I’ll sit quietly
and not disturb anyone.

202
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,140
But it’s an eyesore.

203
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,480
I wanted to see your face
just for a moment.

204
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,830
How many assignments
do you need to submit?

205
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,760
What about your
project for the finals?

206
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,480
I’m doing it now.

207
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,990
Then go do it at a café or the faculty.

208
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:03,510
You told me to be responsible.
That’s what I’m doing right now.

209
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:10,310
Instead of getting distracted elsewhere,
isn’t it better if I stay focused here?

210
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,780
I only need a small space for myself.
I’m not disturbing anyone.

211
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,710
Only this much.
See?

212
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,360
- Mr. Rain.
- Yes, P’ Aon?

213
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:46,660
Mr. Saifha tells you to go inside.

214
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,980
But P’ Payu told me not to.

215
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:53,580
Between you and me, someone’s
using his twin as a cover.

216
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,370
Let’s go.

217
00:20:56,010 --> 00:20:58,390
Weather changes can make you sick.

218
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,710
Young men these days are so mean.

219
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,730
Come on, I’ll give you a hand.

220
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,970
Thank you, P’ Payu.
You’re so handsome and kind.

221
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:19,450
Do you wanna get scolded?
Let’s go.

222
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,510
Oh, a meanie.

223
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,750
Don’t piss me off.

224
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,370
I’m not.
I’ll be straight with you, Big Bro.

225
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,370
It’s okay to worry that the boy
will lose focus because of you.

226
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,100
But don’t be too mean
to him or he’ll run away.

227
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:03,800
If I thought he’d run away,
I wouldn’t have been this invested.

228
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,210
Don’t tell me.

229
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:11,800
Yes, I’m confident that
Rain won’t disappoint me.

230
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:13,350
That’s true.

231
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:18,150
Everyone you pull tricks on
always runs away.

232
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:21,170
A fighter like him really suits you.

233
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,330
He’s more than just a fighter.

234
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:36,050
Who’s smitten with who exactly?

235
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:40,780
The lovestruck one’s not
the boy but you, Big Bro.

236
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,440
What are you guys doing in my dorm?

237
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,700
- Because it’s the closest place.
- Yeah.

238
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,950
Sky, lend me your underwear.

239
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:16,120
I’ve been wearing
the same one for three days.

240
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,800
Ew, three-way technique?

241
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:24,920
- Yeah. Back, front, and inside out.
- Gross. Eww.

242
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:28,030
Just bear with us.
It’ll be living hell again at 8.30.

243
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,810
Who’s gonna wake us up if we’re alone?

244
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,570
We’re gonna pull an all-nighter here.

245
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,600
Yeah.

246
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,930
Isn't it what you’ve been doing these days?

247
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,620
Hey, what about you?
You usually go home when it’s not urgent.

248
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,270
‘Cause your dorm’s close.

249
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,700
I’d rather spend my time
working than driving.

250
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:57,220
And I can stop by the garage
with the remaining time.

251
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,010
Huh? What garage?
Your car’s broken, Cloud Jizz?

252
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:06,010
- Shut up, Home Sig.
- Shut up, Home Sig.

253
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,450
Shut up, Home Sig.

254
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,790
Shut up, Home Sig.

255
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,480
- You’re mocking me?
- Okay, that’s enough.

256
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,500
You won’t finish it
if you stop working.

257
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,720
- He’s getting on my nerves.
- Shut up, Home Sig.

258
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:18,990
Shut up...

259
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,540
Stop.

260
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,150
And you’re still provoking him.

261
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:26,240
And you, Give me the seaweed
and I’ll let you stay.

262
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,810
Give it to me.

263
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:42,350
- Here.
- Gimme, I wanna eat too.

264
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,130
- Well, you’re sure enjoying it.
- It’s tasty. I want more.

265
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,000
Here, take it.

266
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:55,550
- Want some, Sky?
- My dorm belongs to everyone now.

267
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:11,590
Finally submitted all the works.
I’m so sleepy.

268
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:16,420
You okay, Rain?
Wanna go sleep in my dorm?

269
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,940
Thanks, but I'm wide awake.

270
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,250
But you haven’t slept.
You’ll still go?

271
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,280
Yeah.

272
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:25,640
Wow.

273
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,450
Fine, suit yourself.

274
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Later.

275
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,080
Bye bye.

276
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,820
Rain, did you submit the works?
Wanna have lunch together?

277
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,800
Great job, smart boy.

278
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,320
Are you seducing me?

279
00:28:00,450 --> 00:28:02,250
You’re really not gonna wake up?

280
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,160
Ouch!

281
00:28:09,610 --> 00:28:10,870
Why did you hit me?

282
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,070
You seduced me with your bare belly.

283
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,280
I didn't seduce you.

284
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,450
Sleep assaulter.

285
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,560
Sleep assaulter?

286
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,590
How do you know that?
Weren’t you sleeping?

287
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,450
When did you wake up?

288
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:43,220
When you touched my cheek.

289
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,170
So you were still sleeping before that.

290
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,140
Do you wanna know what I said
while you were sleeping?

291
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,780
Why would I wanna know?

292
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,050
‘Cause I wanna tell you.

293
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,420
I said…

294
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,970
You said…

295
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,720
Looks like I’m interrupting.

296
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:27,450
Don’t mind me.
I’ll close the door and leave.

297
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,310
In 3, 2, 1 and continue!

298
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,990
Let’s continue.

299
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,870
Dummy, back off.

300
00:29:49,110 --> 00:29:50,280
Oh, I forgot.

301
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,440
You got a call,
but I told them you’d call back.

302
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,070
Anyway, don’t forget to lock the door.

303
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:05,280
What I wanna say is…

304
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:10,210
Great job, smart boy.

305
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:15,320
Go back to sleep.
I’ll let you rest.

306
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,380
Fighting!

307
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:39,350
Great job.

308
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,270
It’s done!

309
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,850
Model, check.

310
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,480
Presentation boards, check.

311
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,230
I finished two days before the deadline.

312
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,620
This is a miracle!

313
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,020
Wait, Rain.

314
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,530
Let's think over.

315
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:32,970
How many assignments do I have left?

316
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,500
Two.

317
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:40,890
Read textbooks and...

318
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,290
I’m all done!

319
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,250
My bed.

320
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:50,070
Seriously, Rain.
Shouldn’t you use this time to sleep?

321
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,960
Oh, Rainy Boy.

322
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,370
- P’ Saifha, Sawasdee Krub.
- Here to see Payu?

323
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,830
Since you’re here,
I’ll take you to a good place.

324
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,770
We’ve been busy with the
next month’s race preparation.

325
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,260
There, especially that guy.

326
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:26,270
I run the garage in public while
he takes charge behind the scenes.

327
00:34:26,830 --> 00:34:29,880
But he won’t quit his full-time job
no matter how tired he is.

328
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,760
He’s a stubborn guy.

329
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:34,260
When he was a student...

330
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:37,440
He wouldn’t give up his car modification
hobby even if he was very busy.

331
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,550
Have you finished your work?

332
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:55,550
Jeez, just be honest
and say that you’re happy.

333
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,160
Have you finished your work?

334
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,980
A boss like me can
order people to do the job.

335
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,840
I’m gonna teach Rain how
to ride a superbike today.

336
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:09,600
Can you ride a motorcycle?

337
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:15,370
Then I’ll teach you.
Call me Ajarn Saifha.

338
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,370
Okay?

339
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:21,940
Go get your work done.

340
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,030
As for him, leave it to me.

341
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,000
Okay?

342
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,480
Such a dog in the manger.

343
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:50,740
- I finished my works.
- Did you get any sleep?

344
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:55,150
Yes.

345
00:35:56,970 --> 00:36:00,190
I don’t have time to teach you today.
Can we do it another day?

346
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,500
It’s okay, you should get back to work.

347
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,880
It’s my fault I came unannounced.

348
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:10,030
Since you’re busy,
I should go home.

349
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,100
Bye.

350
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:13,600
Stay.

351
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:19,870
Can you wait until I finish my work?
I’ll speed things up.

352
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,180
And I’ll take you to dinner.

353
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,220
I can wait. I’m not in a hurry.
Get back to work now.

354
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:34,450
You gave up sleep to come to me.

355
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,170
So why can’t I rush through
work to spend my time with you?

356
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,500
I didn’t give up sleep.

357
00:37:07,420 --> 00:37:08,520
Thank you.

358
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:21,130
I’ll have someone make a bed
for you, so you can take a nap.

359
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,240
I’ll wake you up after my work’s done.

360
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,460
Sawasdee Krub, Ajarn.
This is my end-of-year project.

361
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,650
As you can see, this house is...

362
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:07,600
Thank you.

363
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,070
Thank you.

364
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:23,250
My project is inspired by…

365
00:38:24,070 --> 00:38:25,070
Umm…

366
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,070
Great job.

367
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:40,700
Thank you.

368
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,960
The inspiration for this
house design comes from…

369
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,880
And that’s the end of my presentation.

370
00:40:01,310 --> 00:40:03,520
It appears that you've
gained a better understanding.

371
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,950
Thank you.

372
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,110
Payu, there’s a problem with
roof structure at the riverside site.

373
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,080
It must be fixed today.

374
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:36,510
I have a meeting.
Can you go there for me now?

375
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:37,970
- Okay.
- I’ll leave it to you.

376
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,300
So cold.

377
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,710
Rain, what are you doing here?

378
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,260
You’re back.
I have something to tell you.

379
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:26,640
Why are you out in the rain?
Do you wanna catch a cold?

380
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:29,540
Didn’t I tell you not
to make yourself sick?

381
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,700
Listen to me, P’ Payu.

382
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:36,490
You told me to prove
that I could be responsible.

383
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:41,430
I didn’t know how to do it,
but I did my best.

384
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,250
And today, the teachers praised me.

385
00:42:45,010 --> 00:42:47,110
So I wanted you to be
the first person to know.

386
00:42:51,250 --> 00:42:52,630
Have I done good enough?

387
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,620
Can I stand by your side now?

388
00:43:39,330 --> 00:43:40,380
Naughty boy.

389
00:43:42,250 --> 00:43:44,210
You constantly stir my heart.

390
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,440
Didn’t you wanna take a bath?

391
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:51,860
Let me go.

392
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,380
That's what we're doing right now.

393
00:43:56,770 --> 00:43:59,260
Because someone’s
body is cold from the rain.

394
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,280
I was waiting for you.

395
00:44:04,820 --> 00:44:07,700
Get out, I’m gonna wash up.

396
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,510
I’m all wet too.

397
00:44:14,370 --> 00:44:17,830
I’ll get sick as well if
I don’t wash up immediately.

398
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:23,440
Then go to another bathroom.

399
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:26,670
Stay still.

400
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,000
Rain.

401
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,840
I’m sorry my phone’s battery ran out.

402
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,320
I’m sorry I was late.

403
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,540
I’m sorry I let you sit
in the rain for hours.

404
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,810
I’m sorry.

405
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:58,060
I forgive you.

406
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:31,830
I didn’t come here for this.

407
00:46:33,130 --> 00:46:36,660
I came to tell you about
the teachers praising me.

408
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,220
Didn't you ask me...

409
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:45,920
If you could be by my side?

410
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,230
This is my answer.

411
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,590
Please don’t stop me.

412
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:09,740
I won’t hold back anymore.

413
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:44,430
Will you?

414
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:53,200
But...

415
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,730
I’ve never…

416
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:00,470
I’ll teach you.

417
00:50:19,100 --> 00:50:22,990
‘Rain belongs to P' Payu now.'
Let me hear it.

418
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,540
Rain belongs to P’ Payu now.

419
00:50:42,180 --> 00:50:43,760
You sneaked in here to sleep again.

420
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:55,740
Your lips aren't covered.
How careless of you.

421
00:51:09,720 --> 00:51:11,640
I’ll wait until you’re ready.

422
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,750
Do your best.

423
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,260
I’m waiting.

424
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:32,970
English Subtitle by Saowalak K.

425
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:36,380
I won’t let you escape.
You lost your chance.

426
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,090
Don’t you understand my feelings?

427
00:51:38,110 --> 00:51:39,660
I wanna talk to you after the finals.

428
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,320
Spring may be coming for you.

429
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,790
Can I have your number?

430
00:51:43,810 --> 00:51:47,870
A place where you can bet everything.
From fame, wealth, to lovers.

431
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,700
That’s the street circuit for you.
