00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,291
Come in.

306

[Javi chuckles]

307
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,166
Why didn't you tell me
you'd be here tonight?

308
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,583
-Because… well, I wasn't planning on it.
-[chuckles]

309
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,083
I don't even know if this is a good idea.

310
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,666
But I was alone at the hostel, and…

311
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:52,833
[sighs]

312
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,875
I'm looking forward
to starting the year with you.

313
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,958
[chuckles] You're adorable.

314
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,750
But, uh… But I have to work, honey.
I can't give you much attention.

315
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,416
That doesn't matter,
as long as we can toast together.

316
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,625
Yeah, but I wouldn't want
you to feel uncomfortable.

317
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,750
If you're referring to Àlex…

318
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,750
-His mother and his aunt are here as well.
-Yeah…

319
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:12,583
Well,

320
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,791
tell them I'm here for you.
If they don't get that…

321
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,125
They don't know, do they?

322
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:24,458
Look, Ramiro, the truth is I didn't think
I would see you again in my life.

323
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:25,541
Why not?

324
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:28,666
I thought that
we had a good time together.

325
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,625
Well, at least I did.

326
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:33,625
I did, and I… I thought you did too.

327
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,958
Hey. How about we do this, huh?

328
00:15:37,041 --> 00:15:40,583
In the morning, when I'm a little calmer,
and when the hangover has ended--

329
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,333
Javier, if you have something to say,
tell me now.

330
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,708
-It's just not a good time right now.
-Javier.

331
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:47,875
Please, just say it.

332
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,458
The other night was fantastic.

[wistful music plays]

334
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:57,625
I wasn't expecting that.

335
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,041
And the truth is,

336
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:03,583
it's been a long time
since I had such a good time with anyone.

337
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,125
Well, same for me. Really.

338
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,208
Yeah.

339
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,916
But I don't think
it's a good idea to carry on.

340
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:14,291
Yeah…

341
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:19,791
Yeah, yeah. I understand. I understand.

342
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:22,375
Look, Ramiro. I don't want you
to think it's because of you.

343
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,458
You are a wonderful person.

344
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,041
But there's Àlex.

345
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,958
-It's very complicated.
-Of course, of course. No, I get it.

346
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:34,625
It's my fault, really, for thinking that…

347
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:37,833
that… [sighs]

348
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:41,416
Don't worry.

349
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,208
[sniffles]

350
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,166
Anyway, I won't bother you anymore.

[Ramiro sighs]

352
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:52,333
-Why are you here?
-No, it's nothing. Don't worry. I'm going.

353
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,666
I'm sorry for the pain
I may have caused you.

354
00:16:57,833 --> 00:17:00,333
And I hope you all have a very happy life.

355
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:01,583
I really do.

356
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,791
Goodbye.

357
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:11,041
Need to tell me anything?

358
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:24,375
Bruno.

359
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,875
-Why are you sitting alone? Where's Ramón?
-Uh, on his way.

360
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:29,416
-Yeah, he--
-You should wait with us in the meantime.

361
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,208
No, no, that's okay, thanks.
No, he'll be here soon.

362
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,708
If he doesn't hurry up, you'll have to
find someone else to kiss at midnight.

363
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,333
[both chuckle]

364
00:17:37,958 --> 00:17:40,458
-I'm sure he'll be here in time.
-Well, I hope so.

365
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:42,416
It'd be a shame for him to miss all this.

366
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:45,250
After all the persuading
it took for me to get you here.

367
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,333
Wait, what are you saying exactly?

368
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,958
-You got a last-minute invite for this?
-Yeah, and…?

369
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:53,458
The plan at first was just to have
a private party.

370
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,500
But people weren't confirming,
and Vero was afraid of falling short.

371
00:17:56,583 --> 00:18:00,125
So yesterday she sent out a bunch
of invites, but to basically anyone.

372
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:01,958
Wait, so you mean Vero?
I thought it was Álex.

373
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,041
Well, Vero convinced him
to send out the message.

374
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:07,291
They thought a text coming
from Àlex directly would work better.

375
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,458
-I have to go.
-You're leaving right now?

376

Yes… uh… Mmm.

-I haven't let him out, and I need to.
-Huh? Wait. But--

379
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,166
Bye.

But I convinced him to stay longer,

384
00:18:25,708 --> 00:18:29,500
and by the time you left he'd already
drunk half a bottle of tequila by himself.

I mean, he couldn't even stand.

I just wanted to see
that he got to the hostel safely.

Yeah, you fell into his bed then.

And? So what if I did?

389
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:41,875
Is it so terrible that I gave him
what I felt he needed?

What we both needed?

there are plenty of candidates.

you want just like that, but I can't.

several admirers out there every night.

So now I have to sleep with guys
that I don't even like?

No, no. Just not the ones
who've screwed over my mother.

I don't care.

401

I only know that he's suffered a lot.

402
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,500
And he's had to make horrible decisions
in the past.

00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,583
There are glasses of grapes
on every table.

457
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,333
-Do you all have your grapes?
-[crowd] Yes!

458
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:47,125
Ah! That's the way I like it,
nice and obedient. [imitates whip crack]

459
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:52,291
[Javi] It's time to take the seeds out
of the grapes if you don't want to choke.

460
00:21:52,375 --> 00:21:54,916
But, of course, you have put
much bigger things in your mouth.

461
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,458
-And you're still alive?
-Hold this.

462
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,291
-What are you doing? Hey!
-[crowd laughs]

463
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,583
Aw, I'm sorry, honey,
but the stage is only for the stars.

464
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:03,000
I know. It'll just take a moment.

465
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:04,958
-I'm sorry. Excuse me.
-Wow. Look at him.

466
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:06,625
-[speakers squeal]
-Uh, hello. Uh, Núria?

467
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:09,333
Núria, it's me. I don't know
if you're around, but if you can hear me

468
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,458
can you come out?

469
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:11,708
Who is this Núria?

470
00:22:11,791 --> 00:22:13,708
-Uh, Núria is my wife.
-Your wife!?

471
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,916
Well, you have the wrong bar. That or
you got it wrong when you married her.

472
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,958
-[crowd laughs]
-[Albert] No, I'm not wrong.

473
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:21,791
And she's here somewhere.
She's here, and I'm, um…

474
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:24,333
[door creaks]

475
00:22:24,416 --> 00:22:26,125
Marrying her's the best thing
I've ever done.

476
00:22:26,208 --> 00:22:29,708
-[Javi] Aww…
-[crowd] Aww…

477
00:22:31,041 --> 00:22:32,416
Hello, my love.

478
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,416
What is this, Albert?

479
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,583
-[sighs]
-No, no, no, no, no, no!

480
00:22:36,666 --> 00:22:39,708
You started the show,
now you finish it. Come on.

481
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,250
-[crowd applauds]
-Let's go. Come on.

482
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:43,291
[Javi] Let everybody hear you. Come on.

483
00:22:46,208 --> 00:22:47,416
[chuckles nervously]

484
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,625
I said… [clears throat]

485
00:22:51,333 --> 00:22:54,416
Yesterday I said
that I needed to find myself.

486
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,208
I already have. I'm in this.

487
00:22:57,708 --> 00:23:01,958
You don't know this, but I kept
all of our New Year's resolutions.

488
00:23:02,041 --> 00:23:04,625
They're all in here,
starting with the first year we met.

489
00:23:04,708 --> 00:23:06,291
Look, um…

490
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:10,541
Ten years ago, we both put down…

491
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:12,208
[breathes shakily]

492
00:23:12,291 --> 00:23:13,666
"To start a family."

493
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:15,166
[wistful music plays]

494
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:16,541
And then we had Julia.

495
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:19,500
And then came Artur and Ariel.

496
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:22,208
They're in here too,
and so are lots of other things.

497
00:23:23,166 --> 00:23:24,583
Renovate the place.

498
00:23:26,416 --> 00:23:28,208
Travel to the Atacama Desert.

499
00:23:28,291 --> 00:23:30,541
Um… be a size medium again.

500
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,750
[all chuckle]

501
00:23:32,916 --> 00:23:34,500
-[chuckles]
-[Albert] Learn Japanese.

502
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:39,083
Well, we didn't do them all,
but… that doesn't matter.

503
00:23:39,166 --> 00:23:40,208
What mattered

504
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,833
was that we wanted them, together.

505
00:23:43,916 --> 00:23:45,125
And especially,

506
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,083
the last one we always wrote.

507
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,208
[stifling sob] To love each other
more and better.

508
00:23:51,291 --> 00:23:53,125
[Albert] It was the most important.

509
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:55,625
And the one I fucked up.

510
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:01,041
[voice shaking] I'm lost, Núria.
I'm… Forgive me.

511
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:04,750
I'm a mess, and I don't know exactly why,
but… [huffs]

512
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,333
But one thing's clear.

513
00:24:08,541 --> 00:24:10,833
That I want to keep writing resolutions.

514
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:13,458
-I want to write them with you.
-[sobs]

515
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:16,041
[Albert] This New Year
and all the ones to come.

516
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:17,791
So what do you say?

517
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:21,250
[sobbing]

518
00:24:27,291 --> 00:24:28,958
[breathes deeply]

519
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:33,875
-Yes.
-[crowd applauds and cheers]

520
00:24:36,625 --> 00:24:39,125
[Javi] Oh, how lovely!

521
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:41,416
Thank you. Thank you, Núria and Albert,

522
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,666
for this wonderful display
of pure heterosexual love.

523
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,750
-I wish you lots of happiness.
-[scattered chuckles]

524
00:24:46,833 --> 00:24:49,625
And that's enough kissing now.
You're stealing my show.

525
00:24:49,708 --> 00:24:51,666
-[Albert chuckles]
-[crowd laughs]

526
00:24:52,166 --> 00:24:54,500
[Javi] We're down to only 10 minutes left,
my queens!

527
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:55,958
-[crowd cheers]
-[Bruno chuckles]

528
00:24:56,041 --> 00:24:58,166
Oh my God. Wow.

529
00:24:58,875 --> 00:25:01,000
[electronic dance music plays on speakers]

530
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:09,375
[line ringing]

531
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:12,500
Patri, I'm sorry. I've been so stupid.

532
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,500
And I'm… I don't care
what you did with Flor.

533
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,291
It's just, I don't know
why I get that way.

534
00:25:16,375 --> 00:25:18,958
Just, please though, please though.
Just listen to me.

535
00:25:19,041 --> 00:25:22,541
I know you won't make it for the grapes,
and I hate that so much, love.

536
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,791
But I don't want us
to start the year off like this.

537
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:28,041
I don't know about that,
but I know we'll be together.

538
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,708
I know there's a lot we need to discuss,
but it can wait until 2023.

539
00:25:34,375 --> 00:25:35,291
Mm-hmm.

540
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,208
[line ringing]

541
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,500
RAMÓN
CALLING

542
00:25:45,583 --> 00:25:47,791
-[call fail alert chimes]
-Hey, Bruno.

543
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:51,000
-Hey, weren't you leaving?
-Uh, yeah, but…

544
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:53,208
-Well, I was waiting here for Ramón.
-Ah.

545
00:25:53,291 --> 00:25:55,708
-I know he'll get here at the last moment.
-Yeah… [chuckles]

546
00:25:55,791 --> 00:25:57,125
-[Ibra] Typical him.
-Yeah…

547
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,375
Àlex, hurry! It's getting close to time.

548
00:26:00,458 --> 00:26:02,208
Sorry. Do you have the grapes already?

549
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,541
-Yeah, right here.
-[Bruno] Yeah.

550
00:26:03,625 --> 00:26:05,041
Do you know those two?

551
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:08,625
-[Bruno] I'm the godfather of their kids.
-[Álex] Oh… [chuckles]

552
00:26:08,708 --> 00:26:10,166
Hey. Can they go in there?

553
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:14,000
Uh, well, they won't be the first
or the last to get laid in that storeroom.

554
00:26:14,083 --> 00:26:16,250
[Ibra chuckles] Are you saying that
from experience?

555
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:19,541
'Cause I'd be into starting
the new year like that. [chuckles]

556
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,666
RAMÓN
WHERE ARE YOU?

557
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,791
I want to spend more time with the kids.

558
00:26:33,708 --> 00:26:36,416
I want us to both travel again.

559
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,583
[chuckles]

560
00:26:39,041 --> 00:26:42,875
I want to quit architecture…
and go back to painting.

561
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:47,666
I want our children to feel proud
of who you and I are.

562
00:26:47,750 --> 00:26:51,083
I want to love you more… and better.

563
00:26:52,083 --> 00:26:54,041
I want to love you more and better.

564
00:26:54,625 --> 00:26:56,625
[clock ticking]

565
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:01,708
-[voice mail beeps]
-Ramón, where the hell are you?

566
00:27:01,791 --> 00:27:03,750
When you hear this,
call me, wherever you are.

567
00:27:03,833 --> 00:27:05,125
He's still in the subway.

568
00:27:05,208 --> 00:27:07,625
-Probably doesn't have a signal.
-Yeah, I guess.

569
00:27:08,125 --> 00:27:10,291
Okay, a reminder for the slow ones

570
00:27:10,375 --> 00:27:13,583
because there's always at least
one of you who messes this up.

571
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:17,375
First the carillon will play,
then the quarters sound,

572
00:27:17,458 --> 00:27:20,208
and only then will you hear
the bells chime.

573
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:23,750
Did everyone get that?
Or should I draw you a diagram?

574
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:27,166
-Five minutes left till midnight!
-[crowd cheers]

575
00:27:29,166 --> 00:27:31,208
I always feel super nervous
till I hear the bells.

576
00:27:31,291 --> 00:27:32,583
[Álex and Ibra chuckle]

577
00:27:32,666 --> 00:27:33,666
Don't you, though?

578
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:36,208
Well, no, for me,
it's a festivity like any other, honestly.

579
00:27:36,291 --> 00:27:37,916
I prefer Saint John's Eve.

580
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,291
Ibra! Ibra!

581
00:27:39,791 --> 00:27:41,666
[gasps] Oh shit! The chest game.

582
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,625
-What chest?
-The chest game.

583
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,291
Well, my friends and I do it every year.

584
00:27:46,375 --> 00:27:47,708
Everyone chooses a resolution,

585
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:51,375
but it has to be something that you regret
not having done the year before.

586
00:27:51,458 --> 00:27:52,958
Like getting something off your chest.

587
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,666
Well, yeah, but, like what kind of thing?

588
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,541
I don't know. Tell me something.

589
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,875
Like one of your regrets.
Anything you wanted to do but didn't.

590
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:04,041
Um…

591
00:28:04,125 --> 00:28:05,916
No, well, I don't have anything.

592
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,500
Well, there must be something.

593
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,375
Yeah, but right now I can't think of it.

594
00:28:10,458 --> 00:28:12,458
[Ibra] Well, you have four minutes
to think about it.

595
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:13,791
-You too, huh?
-Yeah…

596
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,500
When I get back I want answers. Yeah?

597
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:16,458
[Álex] Sure.

598
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,458
[kisses]

599
00:28:25,041 --> 00:28:26,041
Do you have any regrets?

600
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:29,916
You?

601
00:28:30,958 --> 00:28:31,791
Um…

602
00:28:32,625 --> 00:28:33,458
Yeah.

603
00:28:34,041 --> 00:28:35,000
Yeah, actually.

604
00:28:36,958 --> 00:28:40,000
And… can I ask what it is?

605
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:42,958
-No, it doesn't matter now.
-[chuckles] No, no, tell me.

606
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:49,458
-Down to four minutes! Aah!
-[crowd cheers]

607
00:28:50,208 --> 00:28:52,666
I'm sorry. I said I'd buy you a drink,
and I haven't.

608
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,791
Would you like a cava or a cocktail?

609
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,708
Uh, beer is fine.

610
00:28:56,791 --> 00:28:58,750
Okay. Light, toasted, stout, alcohol-free?

611
00:28:59,333 --> 00:29:00,833
I hate alcohol-free beer, Àlex.

612
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,291
It's the first thing I told you
the day we met.

613
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,541
Sorry. I mean, it's just a habit.

614
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:08,000
[scoffs] No, of course.

615
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,666
It's normal that you forget, isn't it?
With so many orders you have,

616
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,333
at the end of the day
you can't keep track of them all. Right.

617
00:29:13,416 --> 00:29:15,666
-Uh, where are you going?
-To find Ramón.

618
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:18,291
-You don't know where he is. Why not stay?
-Why are you insisting?

619
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:22,083
-Huh?
-All night you've been telling me to stay.

620
00:29:22,166 --> 00:29:24,583
-For what?
-'Cause I just wanted to buy you a beer.

621
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,708
-But why?
-Because, Bruno, I feel like it.

622
00:29:26,791 --> 00:29:29,125
Why? To be polite?
You don't have to do that for me, Àlex.

623
00:29:29,208 --> 00:29:31,333
So you don't want a drink or anything?

624
00:29:34,041 --> 00:29:35,708
You wanna know what I want?

625
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:37,791
Sure. Look, I just want a beer.

626
00:29:38,583 --> 00:29:40,541
A beer that's… normal.

627
00:29:40,625 --> 00:29:43,583
I don't want… anything imported,

628
00:29:43,666 --> 00:29:47,708
or any fancy bottle or anything, no.
Just a simple, fresh, cold beer.

629
00:29:47,791 --> 00:29:49,500
I mean, that's all. [chuckles]

630
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:50,416
[wistful music plays]

631
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,458
But I don't know why the fuck
I can't seem to ever find it.

632
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,125
And I don't get it, you know?

633
00:29:56,208 --> 00:29:58,875
'Cause if I look around me,
everybody's drinking beer.

634
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:01,916
Wherever I go, my friends all have one.

635
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:06,416
And, well, I don't know how they do it,
but, if one day they run out,

636
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:08,166
I swear they get another.

637
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,416
They're so happy
'cause they're all drinking it.

638
00:30:10,916 --> 00:30:12,916
But if you want a beer,
then ask me for a beer.

639
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,791
Don't you get that
your beer isn't for me, Àlex?

640
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,833
I loved tasting it. I mean,
I swear it was amazing, I mean…

641
00:30:19,916 --> 00:30:21,458
I love your beer, I really do.

642
00:30:21,541 --> 00:30:24,541
But I can't stop thinking about it,
and I can't let myself drink it.

643
00:30:24,625 --> 00:30:25,458
Not anymore.

644
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:27,708
For a few days I thought I could.

645
00:30:27,791 --> 00:30:31,041
I thought that, if you offered it to me,
I could take it whenever I wanted.

646
00:30:31,125 --> 00:30:33,500
And that's… when you should have offered.

647
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:35,791
When I sent you that smiley.

648
00:30:36,541 --> 00:30:39,500
When I sent you that smiley,
you should have asked if I wanted a beer,

649
00:30:39,583 --> 00:30:40,416
but you didn't.

650
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
And now my beer is with fucking Ibra,

651
00:30:43,083 --> 00:30:45,291
and I have to make do with
a fucking beer without alcohol

652
00:30:45,375 --> 00:30:46,708
that's completely tasteless.

Is that what I am to you? Huh?

666
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:24,791
A tasteless, non-alcoholic beer?

667
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:27,083
-I didn't mean that. I swear.
-Fuck you, Bruno!
